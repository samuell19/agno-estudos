...and changed his country and the whole world forever. M﻿ikhail Gorbachev said the famous words "If not me, who? And if not now, when?" ﻿He made a reform in his country and simultaneously changed the world, ﻿making it safer. more peaceful, and a better place. ﻿Glasnost and Perestroika - he opened his government, ﻿He let freedom into his country. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿I don’t know what it is. ﻿Sharon, take this off me. She fastened it to me. ﻿I think this is the border. I want to cross it. Freedom! ﻿Dear friends! T﻿here are not many people in my lifetime ﻿about whom I can say full-heartedly, ﻿here's the man who changed history forever. ﻿ ﻿Today let's celebrate ﻿one of the most important people of the 20th century. ﻿my hero, my friend Mikhail Gorbachev. ﻿GORBACHEV. PARADISE. ﻿﻿Do you know that I almost kicked the bucket? ﻿No. - No? ﻿Seriously. ﻿Guys, my health... ﻿...has radically deteriorated ﻿Most of all I suffer from... ﻿...the change of weather. ﻿Especially... ﻿...the solar storms. ﻿Magnetic storms are murderous. ﻿You can name our conversation "A dialog with a Weirdo". ﻿Do you feel yourself a free person - Yes, I do. ﻿How does it manifest? ﻿I can speak out. ﻿I can express my opinion. I write a lot. ﻿ ﻿And I write about things as openly as I see them. B﻿ut who hears your statements in Russia ﻿Who has the opportunity to hear you in Russia? ﻿Everyone has. Whoever wants to. ﻿But there are newspapers.. ﻿This is only recently since we encountered... ﻿when they refused to publish me. ﻿They tell me - that's it, the Gorbachev era has collapsed. ﻿You remember? ﻿And I say - who said that? It's just beginning. ﻿All nations should have ﻿an opportunity, ﻿freedom... ﻿ ﻿breadth.. D﻿o you think freedom is something organic for the Russian nation? ﻿Or does democracy mean violence against the Russians? ﻿You know, one can find both when answering this question. ﻿Absolutely. ﻿But there were always those who moved things on. ﻿Right, but they were all either deported ﻿or hanged or forced to leave Russia. R﻿ussia has always returned to non-freedom as its natural form of existence. ﻿Nevertheless, the answer to that ﻿was given to you not by me but by our genuine democrats. ﻿(Pushkin's poem) "While freedom's flame within us lives," ﻿'While we by honour's voice are guided,' ﻿"To Russia, comrade, let us give" ﻿"Our spirits whole and undivided." ﻿Come on, focus on this. ﻿"Deep in Siberia's mines..." ﻿"Let's subdue our proud..." ﻿No, no! "Subdue YOUR proud..." ﻿You're reciting it wrong. This is not about you. ﻿"Subdue YOUR!" ﻿"...spirit. Your crushing toil..." ﻿..and lofty thought... Shall not be wasted. ﻿uss/a shall from her age-old sleep arise ﻿"And despotism impatient crushing..." - "Upon its ruins our names incise!" ﻿The name "Gorbachev" will be on that list, for sure. ﻿Can I say something to the ones present, off the record? ﻿Sure. We're listening. ﻿What you’re offering us is onanism. ﻿That's not so bad, either. - Isn't it? ﻿Do you indulge in it? - Haven't done it a long time. ﻿But, if I understood you correctly, ﻿you compared the search for freedom in Russia with onanism - th﻿at is, with receiving unnatural satisfaction. ﻿And I am ready to agree with you. ﻿Though it's very disappointing. ﻿That's what onanism stands for. ﻿Where's the democracy? ﻿Why're you asking me? ﻿That's right. It's not a question to you. - Absolutely not. Ii still view myself as a socialist. ﻿Frankly, I still see Lenin as our god. ﻿Socialism is a sturdy point of view. ﻿And the more people... ﻿will find new horizons in life, ﻿get used to them, t﻿he greater will be the need for socialism. ﻿But some believe that I have destroyed socialism. ﻿You know, ﻿I wrote my high school graduation essay ﻿and got the highest mark. ﻿I did not choose a literary topic ﻿but I chose from the free topics, which was as follows: ﻿"Stalin is our military glory, Stalin is our youth and mission. ” ﻿This is my point of view. ﻿I was a person... ﻿with a quite good education and a sense of responsibility. ﻿And then I had to... ﻿especially when I became Secretary General... ﻿and got acquainted with the materials... ﻿that had emerged... ﻿This is terrible! ﻿All these lists of executions carried out over tens of years. L﻿ists of a hundred, two hundred people... ﻿These materials are so terrifying - in ﻿both the human and the Party aspects ﻿Stalin was not a socialist? ﻿I think he was rather an authoritarian person. B﻿ut now millions of people support Stalin W﻿hich ones of our leaders were socialist ﻿I was. ﻿Who else? ﻿It will be very interesting for you to say, "When I asked Gorbachev, he said, ‘I was.' ﻿When I asked, ‘Who else?’ he said, ‘No one.’ That was awesome!" ﻿ ﻿Yes... ﻿Life matters the most. ﻿That's it. ﻿And then there's how we use it, and how it uses us. ﻿The day... ﻿Is it the 12th of June, the Day of Russia? ﻿Right? I think so. ﻿Tents are set up in Red Square and tables are laid for the feast. ﻿Tw﻿o groups are walking to meet each other - ﻿Putin and me. ﻿﻿If we personify it. ﻿"Hello." - "Hello." ﻿I say, "Long time, no see." ﻿“You don’t say.” ﻿I say, “No..." ﻿"You're evading me." - "Why so? Why?" ﻿"Why? You set up three meetings with me ﻿and you did not arrive three times." ﻿Don't cry. ﻿Just imagine what I went through. ﻿And he began with the fact ﻿that life is complicated. ﻿Life is life. ﻿And off we went. ﻿They went where they had to go, and we went to the Kremlin Palace. ﻿They went to the square, to have their barbecue. ﻿But we had already been there. ﻿An incident that explains that we had already parted our ways. ﻿Are we parting? ﻿Let's go? - Let's go. ﻿So long, guys. ﻿Should I help you - Wait, Volodya... ﻿No, you won’t lift me like this. My arms can still lift me. ﻿Right, you've been sitting deeply... ﻿Look at this, damn! - You’ve been sitting for a long time. ﻿I'm getting more work to do, not less.. ﻿But no strength. ﻿Can you turn it a little bit? ﻿That's it. ﻿That's it. ﻿Shall we? - You stand firm, Volodya. ﻿Stand firm. And I'll stand even firmer. ﻿That's it. Great. - Right. Right. ﻿Friends installed this elevator for Gorbachev ﻿when they learned that it took him about an hour ﻿to get to his own bedroom on the second floor. ﻿By the time Gorbachev resigned as the head of the powerful Soviet empire, ﻿all his property consisted of a rather modest apartment in Moscow. ﻿We'll leave on the left side. ﻿Down the stairs... ﻿You go down ahead. - Yeah, yeah. ﻿Stand there, on the threshold. ﻿That's it, come on. ﻿Vitaly! -Yes, Mikhail Sergeevich. ﻿Just a second. I'm running. ﻿Vitaly, where have you been? - I'm always here. ﻿Round the clock with you. ﻿When Gorbachev voluntarily resigned from the post of the head of the USSR, ﻿the Soviet republics were given the opportunity ﻿to become independent states. ﻿The party leaders of these republics, subordinate to Gorbachev, ﻿immediately took advantage of this ﻿and turned themselves into rulers of new states. ﻿Some still govern their countries to the current day. ﻿And some have already handed over power to their children, by inheritance. ﻿And in 1991, during the collapse of the USSR, ﻿these heads of the states generously gave Gorbachev this house, ﻿although for temporary use. ﻿You're doing fine. ﻿You're young. Look at your cheeks! ﻿Thank you, Mikhail Sergeevich. So nice to hear. ﻿Well, we can invite guests, right? ﻿Sure. We have the potatoes. Dumplings. ﻿Dumplings should be boiled, right? ﻿You'll tell me when, right? There are some snacks. ﻿You can sit and talk for awhile. ﻿And you'll tell me when the hot dish is to be served. ﻿Although there's the potatoes. ﻿Now listen... ﻿Natasha, where should I put this? ﻿Napkin? You lay it on your knees. ﻿Potatoes... - Count them. There's more of them. ﻿More? - You must count them. ﻿Have they brought this? - No, it's from your garden. ﻿I went there this morning. ﻿It's your favourite. ﻿I'll bring the spoon for the aspic. ﻿Do we have vodka? - We do, Mikhail Sergeevich. ﻿And beer? Sure! How can you do without beer? ﻿I'll go and check. ﻿Natasha, can we sit down? - Sure, you can. ﻿This is to take before. And that's after. - It's for me, right? ﻿I'll put it there. ﻿Tanya there wants to give you a treat. ﻿He had some sausage. ﻿He had the cheese. ﻿But he's an old boy, skin and bones. ﻿Welcome to my place. ﻿This is my home. ﻿Given by the state. But for life ﻿It's not bad. ﻿In our situation... ﻿saying "for life" means much, ﻿since they gave me... ﻿Yeltsin gave me two or three days to get lost. ﻿What money do you live on? M﻿e and everyone around me, my relatives, ﻿live and lived, as Volodya knows, ﻿on the money I earned going around lecturing. ﻿There was a case when I returned home ﻿with the royalties of 400,000 dollars. ﻿But that was just one case. ﻿All the rest were less. ﻿Have you privatized this house? No. ﻿What about your neighbours? - I don't know. ﻿But we do. - Did they privatize? ﻿Heck with them. - Right. ﻿But this also tells something about who the current ones are... ﻿But my conscience is calm! Raisa also hated things like that. ﻿We were conscientious people. ﻿Do your granddaughters come to Russia to visit you? - Not anymore. ﻿Do they still have their rooms here? No? ﻿They have them over there. We bought them. ﻿We had saved some money A﻿nd when our granddaughters got married.. We spent it all, giving half a million each for example. ﻿Live. ﻿There's a flat, live. ﻿ ﻿They are all together there. ﻿Everything is pretty clear about them. ﻿As to me, things are more complicated. ﻿ ﻿While Raisa was alive, they all used to come around. ﻿I still can’t calm down. ﻿After Raisa Maximovna died, ﻿you said a couple of times in public that the meaning of life is gone. ﻿It's gone. - Is it? ﻿It's gone. ﻿What's the meaning of life then? ﻿What's the meaning of life? ﻿Can it be true that the meaning of life ﻿is to simply love one woman and, I don’t know, have children with her? ﻿Isn't the meaning of life in something higher? ﻿But what can be higher... ﻿than the feeling of being in love and being loved by a woman? ﻿(Russian song) "There're so many nice girls!" ﻿"There're so many endearing names!" ﻿"But only one of them bothers me," ﻿"Keeping away my calm and sleep" ﻿I'm starting to forget... ﻿I used to know many poems by heart. ﻿I love poetry. ﻿'"Dear mate, you will stay in my heart." ﻿"It was destined, our separation" ﻿"Still foretells new meeting from the start." ﻿That's Yesenin. A great poet. ﻿(Ukrainian) The mountain is high... ﻿And there's a forest under the mountain ﻿A green and thick forest ﻿A real heaven ﻿There's a river by the forest ﻿Shining like a mirror ﻿Towards the green valley ﻿It's running away ﻿On the coast, in a quiet place, ﻿The boats are tied ﻿Three willows are bowing there ﻿As if they were in grief ﻿In grief for the beautiful summer to pass ﻿With the blows of cold wind ﻿Taking their leaves away ﻿To be taken away, by the stream ﻿To you, dear river... some consolation... ﻿The spring will return ﻿But youth will never return ﻿It will never come back again ﻿I'm five years old. ﻿I'm breathing my last. ﻿Dying. ﻿There is a candle at the head of the bed. ﻿Everyone's crying in Privolnoye. ﻿My mother is crying. It cannot be helped. ﻿What could you do back in 1936? ﻿Finally, some woman showed up ﻿and advised them, “Find some good fresh honey. ﻿Give him a jar of good fresh honey." ﻿They started looking, found it and brought it to me. ﻿Small teapots for tea leaves. ﻿The honey was there. ﻿Well, I remember everything. ﻿And, left alone... ﻿I turned and took that teapot, and drank it all at once. ﻿Three days later I was already running. ﻿Rather than dying. ﻿And surprisingly: ﻿I took it.. ﻿and the lid fell off. ﻿I can still remember the ringing sound of the falling lid. ﻿That's how all our mechanisms work. ﻿Well, I can go on with these stories. ﻿We were already living in Stavropol, ﻿at the highest point, ﻿where the party committee was situated. ﻿Winds were blowing from the steppe ﻿the fragrance was simply intoxicating. ﻿Incredible. ﻿Raisa and I had a habit back then. ﻿I drove her in a car ﻿some fifty kilometres from the centre, ﻿where wheat fields stretched... ﻿endless! ﻿There you could see the quail mating. ﻿When the cornfields are in bloom, ﻿as they're ripening, the quails are running mad. ﻿Love until death. ﻿Oh God. You can live with it. ﻿This is a story about how you lived in heaven. ﻿And now in hell. ﻿Oh my... ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, keep it. ﻿Keep it for now. I won’t keep it in my pocket. ﻿Why do I need it? ﻿No, Mikhail Sergeyevich, it goes with this. ﻿Let it be for now. - Well, I don't need it. Take it away. ﻿They still have some more questions. ﻿Why would I care? We were never separated. ﻿Always together. ﻿Always hand in hand. ﻿It's amazing how it can be this way. ﻿They called me henpecked. ﻿And I never refuted. ﻿I'd rather supported it. ﻿I wanted it to be that way. ﻿It compliments and supports her. ﻿When I began to live together with Raisa, ﻿I made inquiries about her. W﻿e believed that her mother was Russian. ﻿And her father, Titarenko... ﻿was a Ukrainian. ﻿Like in my family. ﻿But my mother is Ukrainian, and my father is Russian. ﻿Her grandfather was executed, her mother’s father. ﻿The whole family got scattered across the country. ﻿And... ﻿I said to her, "You know what struck me?" ﻿She asked, "What?" ﻿“That you are not Russian but Ukrainian.” ﻿“So what's the difference to you?” she asks. ﻿"Well, now I understand why sometimes you are so mean..." ﻿By the way, my grandfather, my mother’s father, also stood trial. ﻿And was sentenced to execution by shooting. ﻿He was in charge of the collective farm that he established. A﻿nd then the assistant regional prosecutor summoned him. ﻿"What is it?" ﻿'As a matter of fact," he says, this is no case for execution." N﻿o crime has been committed whatsoever. ﻿He was released ﻿after 14 months of imprisonment. ﻿He suffered from all kinds of torture. ﻿His hands were broken with the door... ﻿In my opinion, it was because of his commitment to... ﻿Trotskyism. Why the fuck did he need this Trotskyism? ﻿I remember his return. ﻿Only the closest had gathered. ﻿I was sitting on the oven-couch, ﻿all ears. ﻿And he says, “I'm telling you so that you knew. ﻿But no one needs to be told. I'm also not telling." ﻿“Stalin is not to blame,” he always said. ﻿In the 10th form, I joined the Party. ﻿They were so glad - I asked them for advice. ﻿They were so glad that I joined the Communists. ﻿Right, and... ﻿They were also glad ﻿that I was going to continue my studies. ﻿I sent in my documents but there was no response for two weeks. ﻿I had sent a request with a prepaid reply... ﻿...as I realized. ﻿The answer came, ﻿“You are enrolled. Student hostel granted. " ﻿At the Law School... ﻿of Moscow State University. ﻿And when I left... ﻿I was so happy about going to Moscow. ﻿To Moscow! ﻿And then I raised my head and looked around. ﻿To wave goodbye. ﻿And I saw my grandfather, Pantelei, ﻿the one who was sentenced to execution. H﻿e was standing at the window of our cabin and crying. ﻿I can’t forget him to this day. ﻿After this shooting, Mikhail Gorbachev moved to the hospital, ﻿to be under the supervision of doctors around the clock. ﻿Well, you could at least write a couple of words - ﻿who are you, and what is your purpose, ﻿so that Mikhail Sergeevich understood... ﻿But once in the hospital, Mikhail Sergeevich ﻿made a special appointment at his office in the Gorbachev Foundation ﻿to complete the shooting of our film. ﻿After the Kremlin, as an office for his foundation, ﻿Gorbachev was given the premises of one of the liquidated party institutions. ﻿But soon the building was taken away. ﻿Then Gorbachev decided to build his own building to house the foundation, ﻿and he did build it. ﻿But today, to keep the foundation running ﻿a significant part of the premises must be leased out. ﻿Hello, Mikhail Sergeyevich! ﻿The Gorbachev Foundation is left with only one wing in their own building. ﻿But it was important for us to understand how a person, ﻿having climbed the party ladder of the communist regime ﻿from the very bottom to the very top, raised to power ﻿largely owing to personal efforts of the head of the KGB of the USSR, ﻿having gained power, in fact, over the entire communist empire, ﻿which controlled almost half of the world, ﻿realized the need, and then decided, essentially alone, ﻿without supporters among the then government members, ﻿to begin the destruction of the existing regime. ﻿They're waiting for you! - What's there to wait for? I'm ready ﻿(Ukrainian) The Cossacks drove home from the Don, ﻿They deceived Galya, they took her with them. ﻿Oh, you, Galya, young Galya... ﻿ow could one man take a radical decision for the smashing blow, ﻿bypassing the entire system of the state apparatus. ﻿starting a direct dialogue with the nation, ﻿offering them democratization and unexpected freedom? ﻿How was he left without understanding of the same nation, ﻿betrayed and even cursed by so many of the same nation? ﻿We need to be able to make this film. ﻿For some reason I believe... ﻿that there should be such a picture, ﻿and we must not spoil it. T﻿ime shows that my strength is leaving me. ﻿Seriously. ﻿Does it mobilize or demobilize you? ﻿Both. ﻿Volodya, lend me your hand. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Director, come on! ﻿Okay, let’s go on. ﻿Now you are transferred to Moscow, to the Central Committee, ﻿to manage the agricultural affairs. ﻿So, what's next? ﻿As soon as they elected me, security immediately appeared around. ﻿They accommodated me, gave me a hotel room. ﻿Assigned the car and security detail. ﻿I'm sitting at night in that office and thinking: ﻿What am I mixed up in? And why? ﻿was the Tsar and God there, in Stavropol. In the South. ﻿Life was good. ﻿A phone rang. ﻿It's Andropov. ﻿"Where are you now?" I say, "Well, they assigned me here." ﻿“Well, what are you doing?” ﻿“Nothing. Sitting and thinking what am I mixed up in?" ﻿We were close to him since we.. ﻿...worked together in Stavropol. ﻿“Can you come to me now?” ﻿"All right". And I went to the square, to the KGB. ﻿To his office. ﻿Arrived... ﻿"How're you doing?" ﻿" I got everything I need; now I have to work," I say. ﻿They promised to bring my family here later. ﻿Everything is solved. Thank you, Yuri Vladimirovich, for your support, ﻿even though you criticize ﻿"When have I criticized you?" ﻿“In my opinion, every time. You don’t even notice. ” ﻿Yeah... ﻿“I see,” he says, “that everyone wants to quickly wheedle you." ﻿[Prime Minister] Kosygin is whispering something to you, giving a smile. ” ﻿I think, "Well, that's a Chekist on a mission." ﻿Right. ﻿He says, “Misha, I want to make it clear to you. ﻿Brezhnev is the main issue. ﻿He himself several times has raised a question ﻿about his retirement. ﻿We have an agreement, ﻿and we have made a decision ﻿to use him wisely ﻿It would be important to have a centre figure, able to unite. ” ﻿“Yuri Vladimirovich,” I say, ﻿“I have no complaints whatsoever against Leonid Ilyich [Brezhnev].” ﻿“Well, that's all for now. " ﻿So, I joined them, ﻿as a matter of fact. ﻿And then all hell broke loose... ﻿Once, during a vacation with our families, ﻿Andropov's and mine, ﻿while the ladies had gone for a walk, ﻿we also took a stroll together. ﻿And I said, “Yuri Vladimirovich, ﻿since we know each other well, ﻿and get along all right, ﻿I wanted to ask you a question. ﻿In my opinion, no one thinks about the future of the country. ﻿The Politburo, in my opinion, does not." ﻿“What else are we thinking of?!” he immediately reacted. ﻿I say, “Yuri Vladimirovich, we decided to speak our mind. ﻿Take our visits to the Mausoleum before the November parade. ﻿We always have our pictures taken before we start for the parade. ﻿Here is the last picture, look at it carefully. ﻿Can you see at least one young face there? ” ﻿"So what? ﻿Are old people no longer good enough?" - “This is not the point,” I say. ﻿"We are a country of forests, right? There is no forest without undergrowth.” ﻿He remembered it until his dying day. Well, undergrowth! ﻿When I was elected the Secretary of the Central Committee, ﻿and I went to pay tribute, ﻿Leonid Ilyich [Brezhnev] reacted to this election as follows... ﻿I approached him, "Leonid Ilyich, ﻿thank you for your trust, I will do my best." ﻿He did not even look back at me ﻿and did not reach out his hand, nothing. ﻿"Yeah,” he said, “Kulakov was a good man. ﻿I was appointed, and he had proposed me as a candidate. ﻿And now? "Oh, my goodness," I thought. ﻿"What am I mixed up in?" ﻿The situation on the eve of Perestroika was the way... ﻿it seemed, we would never get out of this swamp. ﻿It seemed that everything will go to hell and we'll be in deep shit, ﻿to put it in simple words. ﻿As soon as the opportunity arose and Glasnost was proclaimed... ﻿it was no less than... ﻿by comparison, like clean air. ﻿People need freedom. ﻿Without it a person won't develop and won't understand what's happening at all. ﻿People should know what's happening - ﻿in the country, with power, ﻿what's happening abroad, how other people live. ﻿Glasnost! ﻿And our business is to develop it and to cultivate it. ﻿Our interest is in the ones who live today. ﻿And who eat bread from the fields of Perestroika. ﻿I remembered ﻿my routine as a Secretary General. ﻿Won't you have it? - No. ﻿Will you have a cheese pie with tea? ﻿What kind of pie? - The usual, cheese pie. ﻿Raise your hands, who wants to have tea. ﻿I'll have coffee, I'll bring it over. Di﻿d Europe take the chance provided by you? ﻿I think it did. ﻿What about Russia? ﻿Russia, too. ﻿What do you mean? - What do I mean? ﻿How did Russia take the chance? ﻿We live in peace. In peace we live. ﻿We live in a dictatorship, actually. ﻿Well, you know.. ﻿what we have to do, go through and get over. ﻿It takes time - years and years, ﻿enormous effort and skills. ﻿It's not that easy. ﻿Why is it "so easy" in Eastern Europe? The Czech Republic, for example? ﻿They've been living in a democratic society for thirty years. ﻿But we're still looking back in the past. ﻿What about you? You're writing and making films - ﻿and think that you've been deprived of democracy? ﻿I think I've been deprived of democracy. I th﻿ink there was democracy under Gorbachev and that's it. ﻿Ok, during the first years of Yeltsin. ﻿Even during the last years of Yeltsin, when he gave power to Putin, ﻿there was no longer democracy. ﻿All in all, we have something to discuss. ﻿And you have enough topics for your film. ﻿You'll make your money. Bless you. ﻿I did not understand your answer. ﻿I did not understand the answer. You mean... ﻿Even the attitude towards you... ﻿If you're a hero in Europe... ﻿You're a hero in Europe, no doubt. ﻿No doubt. you're a hero for European states. ﻿For Russia... I wouldn't say so. ﻿Say it. Who's stopping you? ﻿I want to hear from you. - No. Yo﻿u don't say it, because you do not want to. ﻿In Russia, you are not a hero. ﻿I cannot agree with this. ﻿What about your 0.8 percent rating? ﻿Right... all that... ﻿History is a lady of whims. ﻿It's true. ﻿I believe that you will eventually be a hero in Russia. ﻿I am convinced of this. ﻿But, I'm afraid that it won't happen either today or tomorrow. ﻿Do not be afraid! Because I tell you -it takes much time. ﻿And a lot of patience. And skills. ﻿That is, becoming smarter. ﻿This is a huge process... ﻿that can only be compared with eternity. ﻿Hello. - Hello. ﻿Hello again. ﻿Is life going on? - Sure, it's going on. ﻿Is everybody getting it? - They do. The interviewers. ﻿But he's standing. When we're all sitting. ﻿Is it hot? - Yeah. It's hot, it's hot... ﻿Burns. ﻿Who's there in the mirror? Putin? ﻿Gazing. Saying something, nodding his head. ﻿Volodya! ﻿I have never been left frustrated by an open direct conversation ﻿with the highest ... ﻿The first president we contacted ﻿was the most inveterate person. ﻿When we met with Reagan, ﻿on the first day... It was in Switzerland. ﻿I arrived by air, and he met me. ﻿And we talked for the first time, one-to-one. ﻿Apart from the delegations. ﻿We had a talk, we had a great talk. ﻿The beginning was not promising at all. ﻿I went out and our people asked me, "Mikhail Sergeyevich, how did it go?" ﻿“Did you succeed with this falcon?” ﻿say, "He's a real..." ﻿These early animals...? ﻿Vultures ? ﻿Dinosaurs? - Right. ﻿“A real dinosaur,” I said. ﻿Well, he did not leave it unanswered. ﻿They told him what I said. And he... ﻿A couple of days later there was a coverage on this, ﻿and they asked him what was his impression about Gorbachev. ﻿“A stubborn Bolshevik,” he said. ﻿Was he right? Of course not! T﻿hen everything developed with obstacles. ﻿For example, when I arrived on a visit to America, ﻿where we slowly began to sign papers... ﻿And we agreed eventually ﻿that nuclear war is unacceptable, ﻿and there can be no winner in it! ﻿If he starts it, we respond. ﻿we start it, he responds. ﻿And it's enough to blow up the whole motherf***king world! ﻿Motherf***king world... ﻿They say, ﻿the fact that the USSR ceased to exist, ﻿many countries of the world in Europe and America - ﻿is seen as your achievement. ﻿And how do you think? You want to deprive me of the merit? ﻿No, I don't. I want to understand your point of view... ﻿I told you... ﻿what I told you. ﻿Why don't you want to talk about it? ﻿About what? - About the collapse of the USSR. ﻿Why? - Well, you're not talking about it. ﻿That I made it collapse? - No. You're not talking about it at all. ﻿You're not talking about the role of perestroika, glasnost, ﻿and democratization in the collapse of the USSR. ﻿First of all, ﻿I cannot agree with a formulation that the Soviet Union... ﻿our state.. ﻿became a victim of democracy. ﻿No. ﻿I fought a serious battle, fought to the end, as they say, ﻿so that... ﻿for the sake of preservation of the Soviet Union, ﻿that was my position. ﻿Read any of my earlier speeches. ﻿How can I give up on myself? ﻿Ok, now another question. ﻿Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians love you for... ﻿thanks to you, they got freedom. ﻿I do not want to deprive them of their right to love. ﻿Listen, Mikhail Sergeyevich, your answers are really cunning. ﻿I have answered you very honestly. ﻿No. - Honestly. ﻿But these are mutually exclusive things. ﻿Either you are for preserving the USSR, ﻿or you give the right to the Latvians to love you because you ruined it. ﻿But these are mutually exclusive things. ﻿That's what you'll write. So write it. ﻿But I'll stick to my words. ﻿But that's not fair. How is it not fair? Motherf***... ﻿I'm already using filthy language. ﻿Right, but you can either be for the Baltic States gaining freedom, ﻿or for preserving the USSR. ﻿No. - Then explain it. ﻿Like I said. - What did you say? ﻿Someone said I had to shoot them. ﻿Well, if you give the order to fire in one case, and yet in another. ﻿No, that's not right. ﻿I think I did the right thing. ﻿But they fired in Vilnius. ﻿Did the Soviet Army fire or not? ﻿Confusing business. ﻿They are trying to make me responsible. ﻿So that they could bring me to trial. ﻿Are you afraid of trial? ﻿What? - You're a brave man, you're not afraid of anything. ﻿Would you like to be dragged to court? ﻿I won’t let anybody make something up ﻿and then make me responsible for their fiction. ﻿Let someone's plan come true. No. ﻿Look... ﻿What's happening? - What is it? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Is there any mistake that you would not repeat? ﻿I was self-confident. ﻿Excessive confidence grew into self-confidence. ﻿Everyone says: mistakes. Gorbachev’s mistakes. ﻿Have some mercy! ﻿There's no one so talented and capable ﻿hat they could compete with the Almighty. ﻿Or His authorized representatives. ﻿No. It happens to everyone. ﻿You succeed in many things and you fail in many things. ﻿At times they say, “Go at full throttle!” ﻿And at times they say, "Go to bed." ﻿What about the Court of God? ﻿"But there is Court of God, you, evil manifold!" ﻿"The terrible court... it waits" ﻿ ﻿Let's go on? ﻿What about the Putsch - What? ﻿The coup d'etat. ﻿How did you fail to notice the coup lotted by your associates under your nose? ﻿It means I'm weak. ﻿I didn’t chop off anyone's head. ﻿But I don't regret that I did not use the methods of my predecessors. ﻿Even Lenin's. ﻿If this or that situation, ﻿that we cannot define now, ﻿makes us lose our mind... ﻿then what can we even talk about? ﻿Then it's better... ﻿to have a drink. ﻿And then there is Yeltsin's truth, who can drink half a bucket of booze. ﻿And go and relieve himself... ﻿behind the wheel of a plane. ﻿But during the hard-liners’ coup, ﻿It was Yeltsin who saved you. Do I understand it correctly? ﻿Yeltsin helped. And interfered much. ﻿My point of view. And my responsible position. ﻿They told me afterwards, "Why didn’t you send him away?" ﻿Besides, until that time, ﻿I had all rights, reasons, and motives. ﻿And, certainly, I had power. ﻿But it’s not my cup of tea. ﻿I would be in a conflict with myself. ﻿It struck everyone, my closest ones. ﻿That I'm... forgiving. ﻿This would probably suit... ﻿...a tsar ﻿not the Secretary of the Central Committ ﻿When Boris Yeltsin came to power, ﻿he ordered Gorbachev to leave in three days. ﻿But on the next day... ﻿...although we had agreed on a due date... ﻿he arrived early in the morning with his heroes ﻿and drank a bottle of... ﻿...whiskey... ﻿When I called, they told me, "They're already partying in your office." ﻿This suggests one's impertinent nature. ﻿Fool. ﻿Madcap. ﻿The Constitution of 1993.. ﻿was in his face and likeness. ﻿Because it is an autocratic constitution. ﻿Right- ﻿So you did not use the army to maintain your power? ﻿No, I fought to the end, did whatever I could do. ﻿But too many things were happening at once. ﻿The hard-liners, of course, played a role. ﻿It weakened my position. ﻿And supported these scoundrels. ﻿You must know that Gorbachev and Yeltsin are put on a par ﻿both as democrats and liberators, also traitors and destroyers of the USSR. ﻿What do you think of it? ﻿No. It is a big difference. ﻿Yeltsin and Gorbachev -this is a big difference. ﻿Ultimately, are you or Yeltsin to blame for the collapse of the Union? ﻿I would ﻿there is no direct liability. ﻿Though I could prevent this, ﻿and it had to be done. ﻿He just had to be sent away from here. ﻿He had demonstrated that he oscillates, that he is torn. ﻿That is, Yeltsin made the Soviet Union collapse? ﻿I said what I said. ﻿But you didn’t say anything! - That's good. ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, believe me, this is not... ﻿Listen. Vitaly... - Yes. ﻿Case closed. ﻿Around one o'clock tomorrow? ﻿Approximately... - Around one. ﻿Mikhail Sergeevich, this is our director, Alvis. ﻿You've seen his "Shukshin's Stories". ﻿There'll be a new play about you. ﻿Have you already written the play? ﻿No. That's why we came to you. ﻿You have to come when it's ready. ﻿No, there are some ideas I wanted to discuss with you. ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, I'm from Riga. You understood that, right? ﻿We've planned to make a play about you and about Raisa Maximovna. ﻿There will be only two actors. It will be about love and freedom. Y﻿ou said your mother loved to sing a song.. ﻿(Ukranian) "The mountain is high And there's a forest under the mountain" ﻿But I didn't find the melody of this song. ﻿First, the lyrics. ﻿"The mountain is high And there's a forest under the mountain ﻿"A green and thick forest, a real heaven" ﻿She was Ukrainian. - Yes. Can you translate it into Russian? N﻿o! - To be able to understand the meaning ﻿You don't have to do it. - You can understand it. ﻿So that I could understand. ﻿We'll translate it for you. ﻿A green and thick forest, a real heaven... ﻿What is there that you don't understand? ﻿'To you, dear river, the spring will return..." ﻿"But youth will never return, it will never come back again..." ﻿Did Raisa Maximovna sing well? ﻿She could sing along. But she knew less... ﻿Songs? - Ten times less. - What did you sing? ﻿A couple of them... ﻿...were my favourite. ﻿I was singing while I was shaving. ﻿What exactly? Tell us. ﻿Just a sec. ﻿Misty morning, grey morning... ﻿Sorrowful cornfields, covered with snow ﻿Willing or not, you'll remember the past ﻿Remember the faces long forgotten ﻿Remember the faces long forgotten... ﻿Beautiful. Beautiful. ﻿Raisa did not close the door and listened to this concert almost every day. ﻿I'm shaving and singing. ﻿She sang along, right? Wasn't ashamed? ﻿Yes, but she was not a match to Mother. ﻿Are there any of your letters left? ﻿We did have letters, but she burnt them. ﻿All of them? She burnt them all? ﻿At least I haven't found any. Maybe, when we check the archives... ﻿...when they will check, not me... they may find some more. ﻿You said that Perestroika killed Raisa. ﻿I've read it somewhere. The excitement, apparently, she experienced... ﻿Me too. - You too? ﻿Who kissed who first? Did she kiss you first? Or you kissed her? ﻿I see. On the street or in the room? ﻿In Sokolniki Pond. ﻿Pond? Did you go swimming? ﻿Cool. ﻿I wanted to drown her. And then I decided to kiss her. ﻿And what did you quarrel about? If ﻿you had any quarrels? ﻿What were they about? ﻿I'm not a sweet person and she wasn't either. ﻿That's why I'm asking, what did you quarrel about? ﻿Once I said to her, ﻿“For God's sake, don’t piss me off.” ﻿I’d only have to raise my hand once -and it would no longer be needed. " ﻿She reacted to this the way that I thought, “Well, you're a stupid bear” ﻿How did she react? - No, I said that to myself. ﻿I know. But what about her? How did she react? ﻿She reacted so that... she burst into tears, ﻿"Are you going to beat me?" ﻿My first idea was... I thought... ﻿after my Dad and Mum ﻿you're the third person wh® influenced my fate so much. ﻿Who changed my fate. And there are hundreds of millions like me. ﻿You know, Mikhail Sergeevich... ﻿Alvis and us, we are interested -the man who just changed the world... ﻿There was Lenin, right. Lenin changed his age. ﻿He changed it like... ﻿Changed, only with a negative value. ﻿But Lenin was not alone. There was a bunch of them. ﻿But he was the brains. - In this case, one man changed. ﻿The question is, what kind of person are you? ﻿hat's why Alvis is reading heaps of books ﻿Where do you come from? Your Mum, the song... ﻿How does it actually happen? ﻿You have changed the course of history, ehanged the whole planet... ﻿Well, perhaps we can finish with this. ﻿o I'm taking the cabbage and the apples? ﻿Yes, yes, do it... ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, let’s take it off. ﻿What is it? Quiet! ﻿It’s name? - Fabio. ﻿An Italian. Translation? ﻿An Italian. - Charming. ﻿Fabka. ﻿Fabioso. ﻿Some bread. ﻿Tanya, do not forget the aspic. ﻿Have some salad, Mikhail Sergeyevich. ﻿Your assistant makes it himself. ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, I made it. - Should be tasty. ﻿Yes. Sure, it should. From start to finish. ﻿Well, I am now . Yes? ﻿No way. -Why? ﻿You can’t entice me... eating. ﻿Aren't you hungry?... ﻿Check. Check. Check. ﻿ ﻿Is there any beer? Pour it in! ﻿How much is it? Five roubles? Pour it out! ﻿How much is it? Five roubles? Pour it out! ﻿Oh, Mikhail Sergeyevich, I'm so glad. ﻿I think this is the first time we're meeting like this, right? ﻿Have you been here before? - We also have not. Ca﻿n you imagine what New Year is like for u H﻿ave you been living here for a long time? ﻿35 years. - In here. ﻿That's why we have to raise a glass... For that. It's the most important thing. I﻿'ve lived for twenty years without a wife ﻿and I feel that it is no good. ﻿So let Tanya say a toast. We are at her house. Say it. ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, I can’t imagine how I'd live without men. ﻿I can’t imagine. He’s my rock. ﻿I knew who I was giving the toast to. - The Bastion of everything. ﻿Right. In general, be healthy. ﻿Here's to this union! ﻿Peace and friendship. I ﻿am very glad to see you. - Guys! ﻿Nothing doing, old age takes its toll. ﻿Time flies. ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, I just saw it... - Our time flies. ﻿Your pill... ﻿We don't want to forget it. ﻿There's a heap of them. Would you like some water? ﻿I'll bring it. - Sit down. There's no need. ﻿Here they are, Mikhail Sergeevich. ﻿Mikhail Sergeyevich, which New Year do you remember especially well? ﻿Since your childhood? ﻿Oh, there's so many... ﻿Come on, buddy. Good boy. ﻿Good boy. A miracle... ﻿Nice little nose... ﻿Say something on New Year's Eve. ﻿What you are hoping for. And what your are not. ﻿We've become quiet. ﻿Quiet because we're lost in thought. ﻿What will happen this year. ﻿What are our thoughts and calculations for this year. ﻿Great, indeed. ﻿And time is flowing, not dripping. I ﻿don’t sleep much at night. I think. ﻿I think a lot. ﻿If it’s not a secret, tell us about what. ﻿Hands up! ﻿Why are they pestering me, eh? ﻿Shall we probably bark at them? Or not? ﻿We'll still need them. ﻿Such a good boy. ﻿Will you get it? ﻿Hallo? ﻿This is not Volodya. ﻿This is me. ﻿Yeah,things happen. It's t he New Year. ﻿It is a pity that you are not there, in this small... ﻿company of friends. ﻿I wish you a happy New Year from the bottom of my heart, ﻿as a brother. ﻿I'm in the hospital for now. ﻿I cannot really say I'm better. ﻿But there is some progress. ﻿I often think about you. ﻿Where shall I invite you when we take power again? ﻿All right, I won’t take power. ﻿Bye. ﻿We strive to do something important and useful for other people ﻿And to help those who require our support, ﻿to make them happy by giving them presents and our attention. ﻿Such sincere impulses, pure thoughts and selfless generosity ﻿are the true magic of the New Year holiday. ﻿It brings out the best in people. ﻿We’re living with wonderful impressions since childhood. ﻿They come back every New Year, ﻿when we hug our loved ones, our parents, ﻿prepare surprises for our children and grandchildren, ﻿decorate the New Year tree with them and unpack once again paper cut-outs, ﻿baubles and glass garlands. ﻿These, sometimes ancient, but beloved family trinkets ﻿give their warmth to the younger generations. ﻿Of course, each family has its own New Year traditions, ﻿but everyone is united by an atmosphere of kindness and care. M﻿ay the happiness of mutual understandin be in your home forever, ﻿Happy holidays and a Happy New Year 202 ﻿Precisely calculated. ﻿Hello, New Year! ﻿Hooray! ﻿Russia - our holy nation... ﻿Russia - our beloved country. ﻿A mighty will, great glory ﻿These are yours for all time! ﻿Be glorious! ﻿our free Fatherland! ﻿Free Fatherland. ﻿And who brought freedom? ﻿Dear compatriots. fellow citizens, ﻿as a result of the newly formed situation, ﻿creation of he Commonwealth of Independent States, ﻿I cease my activities ﻿in the post of the USSR President. ﻿I am making this decision out of considerations based on principle. ﻿I have firmly stood for independence, self-rule of nations, ﻿for the sovereignty of the republics. ﻿but at the same time for preservation of the union state, ﻿the unity of the country ﻿Events went a different way. ﻿The policy prevailed of dismembering this country and disuniting the state. ﻿With which I cannot agree. ﻿With which I cannot agree. ﻿I am leaving my post... ﻿with apprehension, but also with hope, ﻿with faith in you, your wisdom and force of spirit. ﻿I wish all the best to all of you. ﻿After reading the resignation speech, I wanted to have tea from the cup ﻿that had been placed on the' table. ﻿But the cup turned out to be empty. ﻿They had forgotten to pour the tea in. ﻿On 23 December 1991, Gorbachev opened his private safety deposit box, ﻿took a pack of secret papers from it and gave it to Yeltsin. T﻿hen Gorbachev drank two shots of vodka ﻿after which he said he wasn't feeling well ﻿and hid in the lounge room. ﻿Yeltsin and Yakovlev went on eating, drinking and communicating, ﻿until Yeltsin left the office, walking like a winner. ﻿Yakovlev watched him taking firm steps on the parquet floor of the empty corridor. ﻿Mind that this place is mine. ﻿Booked. ﻿The mountain is high ﻿And there's a forest under the mountain ﻿A green and thick forest ﻿A real heaven ﻿There's a river by the forest Shining like a mirror ﻿Towards the green valley It's running away ﻿On the coast, in a quiet place The boats are tied ﻿Three willows are bowing there As if they were in grief ﻿In grief for the beautiful summer to pass With the blows of cold wind ﻿Taking their leaves away To be taken away by the stream ﻿To you, dear river, The spring will return ﻿But youth will never return... ﻿But youth will never return
