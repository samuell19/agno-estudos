[narrator] Once upon a time, there was a baker from Chicago. Merry Christmas. [narrator] That's me, Stacy, who looks just like Margaret, the duchess of Montenaro. Stacy, me again, married the handsome Prince Edward at Christmas, while Margaret married my adorable best friend Kevin right before she was crowned queen of Montenaro, which almost didn't happen, because her cousin Fiona, who looks like both of us and is so over-the-top... Maggie Moo! [Stacy] ...impersonated her in an attempt to steal the throne. Luckily, Fiona was caught and sentenced to many years of community service. I thought she should go to jail, but Margaret says she's family. [chuckles] Could Christmas get any more eventful? - Well, maybe. - [sirens wail] Because this year, I'm cochairing an international Christmas festival with Margaret, who's just about my best friend in the world. - [triumphant music plays] - [crowd cheers] And to commemorate the occasion, the Vatican has loaned us the Star of Peace, a priceless relic that once belonged to Saint Nicholas himself. [sirens wail] The Star will be kept under guard until it goes on top of a ginormous tree at our tree-lighting ceremony on Christmas Eve. [crowd cheers] Oh, and that's Cardinal Amoah, the special emissary from the Vatican. Oh, this is so huge! Can you believe this? It's incredible. I feel like we're making history. Because you are making history. [chuckles] - [triumphant music continues] - [exhales] [triumphant music intensifies] [exhales] [triumphant music stops] Your Royal Majesty, Your Highness, I present to you the Star of Peace. - [triumphant music plays] - [crowd cheers] [triumphant music ends] [calm music plays] No one's getting paid a dime. It all goes to charity. Yes, we had a cancellation, so there's one final audition to fill the spot in the program. [Kevin] Okay. Bye. Stacy and I are handling the details ourselves, so we'll be there. All right, thank you for checking. Bye. [exhales] That's the last call I'm taking tonight. Me too. - [chuckles] - [tablet rings] Oh, except for this one. Hey, Liv! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. Mm, we miss you, darling. How were exams? [Olivia] A major pain. I love the ballet academy, don't get me wrong, but they make you work really hard on the school part. Oh, it's nothing you can't handle. Are you on your way to the airport? That's why I called. JFK's closed because of the weather. The chaperone says we might leave from Bradley. Oh. Well, keep us posted. I love you. I love you more. - [call disconnected] - [Kevin sighs] I'll sleep better once I know she's here. Yeah. You and me both. [chuckles] Come here. [Edward] Very good, Your Majesty. Margaret and I love working together. Yeah, I'm sure we'll do it again. It's just right now we kinda have our hands full. We would love to see the corgis as well. - Absolutely. You can quote me. - Yes. And a very Merry Christmas to you. - Thank you so much. Bye. - [Edward] Cheers. Well, that makes 11 ambassadors, nine prime ministers, seven kings, four queens, an entire delegation from Penglia... And a partridge in a pear tree? - [sighs] Something like that. - [Stacy laughs] [exhales] I'm so glad I have you to help me with all this crazy last-minute stuff. We make a great team, don't we? Just like your dear old Chicago Red Sox. It's White Sox. Yes, them as well. All the socks. [both chuckle] [choir] ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ - Oh, bravo! - Fabulous. - Thank you very much. - This way please, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe we put them after the yodeler? Do we really need a yodeler? Well, we don't want to offend the Swiss ambassador. We don't want to offend anyone. [clicks tongue] Yeah. I'm terribly sorry to interrupt, Your Majesty, but we have, well, a bit of a situation. This is Inspector Moretti, superintendent of police. The police? Well, that sounds serious. I'm afraid it is, Your Majesty. [tense music plays] [indistinct police radio chatter] [tense music intensifies] [Stacy] The Star of Peace is gone. [exhales] This can't be happening. Isn't the museum vault under guard around the clock? The guards were drugged. We found traces of chloromethazine in the ventilation system that services the security office. Surely there's surveillance footage. The thieves wiped the hard drives clean. Whoever did this came prepared. We've notified Interpol, but with no forensic evidence, we've very little to go on. Just please promise us you'll get it back in time for the ceremony. I'm afraid that would be a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken. Oh dear! We'd like to keep the investigation confidential until we know more. Well, shall we notify the cardinal? Since it's possible the breach came from within Vatican security, Interpol has asked us to hold off until we rule them out. Just know we're doing everything we can. Well, thank you, Inspector. [sighs] The relic of Saint Nicholas. I mean, this is an international scandal of epic proportions. [Kevin] Let's just try to stay calm, okay? Yes, of course. [clears throat] Keep calm. - I sympathize with you completely. - [sighs] Thank you. But when the crown jewels of Belgravia were stolen, oh, my grandfather, the king, was nearly deposed. - [sighs] - Not helping. But the jewels were eventually recovered. - Well, bits and pieces. - Ah. A ruby here, a sapphire there, a diamond, you know. Dude. Come on. There must be something we can do. - [exhales] - The police are handling it. They have no clues and no leads. Wait. If the police don't have any leads, then it's up to us to come up with something they haven't thought of. Like what? Well, what we need is someone with information that the police don't have. Someone with connections to the black market, and it wouldn't hurt if they were just a little bit crooked. A little crooked? [exhales] Yes, indeed. We need a person who actually thinks like a criminal, who has a history of never considering consequences, and has absolutely no fear of breaking the rules. - If only we knew someone like that. - [both] Fiona. [bell dings] If anyone knows the unseemly side of things, it's my cousin. [scoffs] I should know. I'm sorry. Let me get this straight. You want to employ the woman who, with the help of her cohorts, masqueraded as you in an attempt to take over the country? Didn't she go to jail? Fiona's serving a sentence of community service at St. Michael's Convent. I was actually thinking of inviting her for Christmas before any of this happened. You were? I've always felt sorry for her, growing up in boarding schools with no one to look after her. I think this past year at the convent's done her some good. Not that much good. Look, it's not like I trust Fiona, but I mean, St. Michael's is less than an hour away, and the police are stumped. It would be unconscionable to sit here and do nothing. What have we got to lose? You know, anything and everything that isn't nailed down, but... [sighs] ...I can't think of any other ideas, so... Kev? [sighs] I'll start nailing things down. [adventurous music plays] [adventurous music ends] [nun] You missed a spot. Where? [nun] The library. You know, the place with the books. [scoffs] It's time for my break. [nun] Need I remind you, Fiona Pembroke, that you still owe 1,242 hours - of community service? - [watch beeps] Oh, 1,241. [nun] Be that as it may, Mother Superior wants to see you in her office. Now! [Fiona hisses] Savage. [mischievous music plays] The sisters and I are absolutely thrilled Ms. Pembroke will be spending Christmas with you. She's the only family I have left. Well, and her mother, but I haven't seen my aunt in years. I do hope Fiona hasn't been too much trouble. [chuckles] We are all God's children, my dear. [chuckles] [door opens] [gasps] Maggie Moo! Oh! [giggles] Oh! What a scrumptious surprise. Oh, you're looking well. What brings you to my private little corner of purgatory? [chuckles] I thought it might be pleasant for us to have the holidays together. Oh. Will I be mopping or dusting? [chuckles] You'll be our guest. [Mother Superior] After, uh, prayerful consideration, I've told Her Majesty I could allow a discrete bending of the rules, seeing as it's Christmas. As long as you promise to return by December 26th. There's a hearing of the disciplinary committee for which you must be present. We absolutely promise to have her back in time, Mother Superior. You have my word. [inhales] Well, in that case, Ms. Pembroke is free to spend the holidays at the palace. Sounds like a gas. [sultry music plays] Thank you, Inspector. Yeah, keep us posted. Anything? They thought they had a lead, but it didn't pan out. [exhales] We could certainly use some good news right about now. No worries, royal six-pack. Good news has arrived. Special delivery. - Handle with care. - [Fiona] Hm. [sighs] [Fiona chuckles] Mm. [jazz music plays] [Stacy] Um, Reggie and Mindy? You gotta be kidding me. Fiona agreed to help us, but she said she needed her squad. - Weren't they in jail as well? - [scoffs] They were, but I, uh, pulled a few strings. [chuckles] Well, it's good to be queen. [glasses clink] [sighs] How's my fave cuzzie-in-law? Fine, I guess. I hope you ain't still sore over our little mix-up last Christmas. - Mix-up? - [Reggie] Yeah. You kidnapped me! Okay. Still sore. Spicy. Why don't I have Mrs. Donatelli show you your rooms? This way. Please. [sultry music plays] Meow. Right, yes, uh, meow to you as well. [purrs] - No respect. - [mouths] No. None. Cool. [birds chirping] Am I late for brekkie? Only by an hour... or three. No worries. I couldn't eat a thing. Hey! But I do have news. I've been in touch with an associate who should be able to help us find our missing treasure. [Margaret] Does this associate have a name? I'd rather not say until he's on board, but trust me, he's the GOAT. Sorry, he's... he's a goat? "Greatest of all time," babe. It's like a sports thing. I knew that. I... I knew that. [Mindy] I bet it's that count from Barcelona. [Reggie] Nah, he's a squirrelly one. Never looks you square in the eye. He's got a glass eye, idiot. Oh. [inhales] I'll need to borrow a car, and preferably a 'rari that matches my Manolos. Don't worry. Frank will be happy to drive you. Don't you trust me, royal boo? [Stacy] Hell no. And Bonnie and Clyde are staying right here just to make sure you come back. - [scoffs] - Here? What are we supposed to do all day? Perhaps you could start by, uh, returning the silver. Reggie! What? [sighs] Dear. [uplifting instrumental music plays] [uplifting instrumental music intensifies] [uplifting instrumental music ends] Right. Okay. Now look, I don't wish to be impertinent, Your Ladyship, but if you're not out in 20 minutes, I have strict orders to come in there and fetch. - Mm. - [tense music plays] Bossy. [Frank] Hm. Remember! Twenty minutes! [door creaks] [exhales] [tense music continues] [door closes] You haven't lost your touch. [tense music ends] Some say. You're looking well, Peter. You too, Pemmie. It's Pembroke. You'll always be Pemmie to me. [scoffs] So, how long has it been since you walked out on me that spring night in Barbados? Oh, please. We were always better as friends. Everything else was a complication. [bottles clink] That's an interesting word for it. [Fiona exhales] I heard from Bianca the other day. Mummy's always had a soft spot for you since we were in nappies. She says you won't return her calls. I have nothing to say. [Peter] Oh, come on, Pemmie. It's Christmas. Give the old girl a break. If I remember, you weren't speaking to your father. No. I wasn't. But I saw him last Christmas, two days before he passed. And I'm very glad I did. Well, now that we've limped down memory lane, can we talk business? The Star of Peace. You want my help getting it back. Question is, why is it so important to you? [Fiona] Well, it's important to my cuzzie. I treated her... [sighs]...unkindly, so I thought I'd make it up to her. [chuckles] Yes, I heard about your little escapade. So, will you help despite our colorful past? You know the answer to that. [tense music plays] No matter what, no matter where? Let me show you what I've dug up. [chuckles softly] [dramatic music plays] - Are you coming? - Mm. [computer beeping] Et voilà! The Interpol case file. Interpol? I thought you left them. That doesn't mean I've forgotten how to get around their firewalls. - Oh. - According to this report, there are no suspects in the theft, but the interesting bit is that chloromethazine was used to drug the guards. Why on earth is that interesting? Interpol is utterly convinced that the black-market supply is limited to an Asian distributor. And it is, except for one disreputable pharmacist in Geneva, who runs an after-hours operation out of the back of his warehouse on Place du Port. [inhales] Now, lucky for us, there are security cameras all along the riverbank. I searched through the last three days of footage and came up with this. [computer whirs] [tense music plays] [computer beeps] [computer beeps] [computer beeps, whirs] That's Itai Krauss. Do I know him? Indirectly. He works for an old friend of yours. - [computer beeps] - Hunter Cunard, the billionaire hotel tycoon. Why would a hotel tycoon steal the Star of Peace? It's a little-known fact that Hunter's secret obsession is collecting precious items that aren't for sale. Paintings, antiquities, jewels. He loves an impossible challenge. You've been an invaluable help, Mr. Maxwell. I'm certain the police will be grateful for the information. Maggie, don't be silly. You can't go to the police. Why not? Hunter has friends everywhere. One wrong word to the wrong person, and the Star disappears forever. [scoffs] So, what do we do? The only thing you can do. You steal it back. - [mischievous music plays] - [scoffs] How? Every Christmas, Hunter hosts an exclusive soiree at his estate. It happens to be this Saturday night. [sighs] Well, I assume security will be tight as a drum. - Oh. - [Peter] It will be, but there'll also be people coming and going, caterers, florists, guests, which affords us the perfect opportunity. All we have to do is make sure Hunter is occupied, and lucky for us, he used to be quite enamored of Fiona. Oh! So, uh, this bad boy had a thing for you, huh? Oh, we had a bit of a steamy. [chuckles] But he wasn't my type. So, when was the last time you spoke to this Mr. Cunard? [scoffs] A few years ago. We both moved on. If it's been years, how are you gonna get invited to the party? Hunter walks his dog through the park behind the library every morning at 8:00 a.m., rain or shine. Fiona will do the same. I'm certain once they coincidentally run into each other, she can charm an invitation out of him. Where is she gonna get a dog? Hm, I can pinch her a pooch. Forgive me, but aren't you the Peter Maxwell who worked for Interpol and was, well, charged with a rather large-scale diamond theft? [tense music plays] The charges were dismissed, but the incident tarnished my reputation, so I resigned and started my own private security firm, which has proven quite lucrative. Mm-hmm. So what's your finder's fee? - There is no fee. - Why not? Let's just say... I have my reasons. [tense music ends] [dog pants] [exhales] This isn't a dog. It's bloody Big Foot. Pugsley's a pussycat. You just don't know how to handle him. [Fiona scoffs] I know how I'm going to handle you if I break a heel. If I can have your attention... [on comm]...Hunter's just arrived. - [Fiona] Location? - [Peter] He's headed your way. - [dog sniffs] - [Fiona grunts] [groans] Oh, he's lush. [Peter] You'll intersect his path in 100 yards. Would you please get your nose out of that bush? [Mindy] He just passed the latte stand. Ugh, what seems to be your problem? I don't have a problem. Not you. - [squirrel squeaks] - [dog barks] - No. No. - Pugsley! Stop this at once! Naughty dog. Bad dog. Stop! Dog! [gasps] Oh no. [grunts] [groans] Wretched. My nail! - [chuckles] - [Fiona] I've broken a nail! [Reggie laughs] - Where'd you get it from, a horse ranch? - Would you watch what you're saying? You couldn't have got us a toy poodle? Oh, because poodles grow on trees. Did she say poodles grew on trees, genius? Oh, look, it's a poodle tree. [gasps] Let's pick us a white one, shall we? [Peter whistles] - Can we talk about plan B? - Thank God there's a plan B. Peter always has a plan B. [Peter] Hunter's newest boutique hotel is unveiling its Christmas decorations tonight. He's planning a walk-through at four. It might be a bit difficult to get his attention, but I'm sure you'll be up to the challenge... - [scoffs] - ...once you freshen up a bit. Excuse you. Messy becomes you, Pemmie, but it's a bit overdone. [scoffs] Here. [romantic music plays] I hate to interrupt, but if we're gonna get there by four, we better get on with it. Yeah, just give me 20 minutes to moisturize. You two aren't going anywhere. - What? - What? Do not ask me to explain why after what just happened. - But I didn't do anything wrong! - Zzzt. Zzt. [exhales] [Mindy] Now she's mad at me! - [Reggie] That's not my fault. - [Mindy] Of course it is. - [Reggie] No, it's not. - [Mindy] It is. - [Reggie] No, it's not. - [Mindy] It is. [both argue indistinctly] [romantic music continues] [romantic music ends] [upbeat music plays] [chuckles] - [woman 1] Hi! - [woman 2] Hi! It's you! - Thank you for coming. - [woman 2] Thank you. - [Peter on comm] Get ready. - [man] Yes, ma'am. [woman 1] Come. [Hunter] I guess it looks fine. Just remember, finish by five, or you're fired. [woman 3] Yes, Mr. Cunard. He's on his way. [on comm] Be ready. Absolutely. Let's make some merry, shall we? - Welcome to Santa's workshop. - [Fiona] Thank you. - [sultry music plays] - [camera clicks] - [Santa] I hope you've been a good girl. - [Fiona chuckles] Never. Say mistletoe. [both] Mistletoe! [chuckles] [Fiona] Have you been naughty or nice? Fiona Pembroke. Hunter. [chuckles] What on earth are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing. Well, age before beauty. I own the place. - You're joking. - Not at all. Now it's your turn. Well, the lounge here serves a candy cane martini that's to die for. Then what are we waiting for? [sultry music ends] [Hunter] What about you? You been busy spending your inheritance? More or less. It's all such a bore. What ever happened to that dreary little rodent that you were seeing when we met? Peter something. - Peter Maxwell. - [Fiona scoffs] That wretched little man. Oh, you were quite stuck on him as I recall. I don't get stuck on anyone. Oh, I'm well aware of that. If I was a sentimental sort, I'd say you broke my heart. Mm. We're quite the pair, aren't we? - Cut from the same cloth. - [Fiona] Mm. [gentle piano music plays] Which means we both know that you didn't just wander in here for the martinis. So why don't you tell me the real reason for this coincidental meeting? [tango music plays] All right. It's true I inherited Daddy's fortune. It's also true that there's very little of it left. [Hunter] Oh. So you're here for a handout. Oh, no. Not a handout. A proposition. What kind of proposition? Well, the Pembroke estate, it would make a darling boutique hotel. You're not serious about selling. Dead serious. But Pembroke's been in your family for generations. If you're not interested... [scoffs] Sit... down. I didn't say I wasn't interested. Let's talk about this after the New Year, shall we? I'm insanely busy until then. [Hunter] All right. After New Year's. - [tango music intensifies] - Ciao. [Hunter] Fiona! I'm hosting a little holiday party at my home in the country on Saturday. [Fiona] Mm-hmm. Cocktails at six, dinner at eight, if your busy schedule will allow. Will there be candy cane martinis? Anything your heart desires. Mm. Delicious. See you Saturday. Oh, and, uh, you owe me a tango. [chuckles] [jazz music plays] [Frank] Good evening, Ms. Pembroke. Well? [scoffs] You took a risk, and it paid off. Is that all you have to say? If Hunter wasn't utterly besotted with you, he'd have called your bluff, and we'd be up a creek right now. [scoffs] You're jealous. [scoffs] I'm not jealous. Oh, you're completely jealous. - Do you want me to be jealous? - [Fiona scoffs] Don't be ridiculous. Because being jealous would mean there's something between us. - And there is nothing between us. - Absolutely nothing. - Positively nothing. - Completely nothing.

And once you're inside the gallery? [computer beeps] The display case is surrounded by a web of laser motion detectors. - We'll need to disarm them. - Dibs on the lasers!

Well, Hunter can't call the police to report the theft of something he's stolen. In situations like this, he has a history of making the problem disappear. Forever.

[chuckles] - Please help yourself. - [Reggie groans and screams] - [gasps] What in heaven's name was that? That was the yodeler rehearsing for the ceremony. The poor fellow sounded a bit hoarse. Which is why he needs to practice. [laughs] Ah. [laughs] [laughs] [Reggie groans] [grunting] [moans loudly] - [chuckles] - [panting] The doctor said it's just a sprain. There is no way you can climb up the side of a building. I could supervise from the van. - You're not supervising me, mate. - Wh... [moans] We still need two people to get around security in the gallery. Mindy can't do it. She's handling the cameras. Why not let Fifi do it? She had the moves down cold. Fiona will be with Hunter. I'm afraid we're back to square one. We'll have to come up with something else. But there isn't time to come up with something else. [scoffs] Pay attention, Betty Crocker. I can't be at two places at once. - [Frank] Wait a minute. - Darling. [Frank] Maybe she could. [Edward] What was that, Frank? [Frank] Forgive me for pointing out the obvious, but if Ms. Pembroke could successfully impersonate Her Majesty, it stands to reason that Her Majesty could impersonate Ms. Pembroke. - [scoffs] Not in a million years. - [Frank squeaks] Bite your tongue. - It's completely out of the question. - [scoffs] Certainly, sir. I... I was just thinking out loud. How very stupid of me. That's all right, Frank. We all come up with bad ideas now and again. - Indeed. - It is an outrageous idea. But I did switch places with Stacy twice, and no one was the wiser. [chuckling] Trading places with Ms. Pembroke? That's a different matter entirely. Yeah, but all she'd have to do is keep Hunter busy while they break into the gallery. The whole thing should take less than an hour. You can't be serious. It really isn't that long. [Fiona] Listen to me. Hunter Cunard is a dangerous and complicated man. No, Maggie could never pull it off. Why not? Well, not to be unkind, Moo, but you certainly don't have the, uh... [inhales]...je ne sais quoi. [chuckles] [Reggie snickers] [scoffs] [mimics Fiona] Minions, fetch me my champagne. [scoffs] I do not sound like that. [Fiona scoffs] [mimics Fiona] Hello, royal six-pack. [laughs] Oh. Well, you sound exactly like that. - I do not. - You do. - But I don't. - But you do. - But I don't. - You really do. - But I... - [mimics Fiona] Zzzst. Oh, she's good. Look, I have to object. It's... it's far too risky. If it means recovering the Star... [sighs]...it's a risk I'm willing to take. Indeed.

[Fiona] Now you've got it. Let them know you're... [Fiona] Hunter and I met five years ago. He plays tennis and polo, which is a total bore, but he can't resist a good martini. Oh. I told him I wanted to sell Pembroke. - You did? - Hm. And he's excellent at the tango. I might need to brush up. [chuckles] Not to presume, Mr. Maxwell, but if you are in need of a wheelman, I am more than happy to volunteer. [upbeat tango music plays] Now, that's not something you see every day. Hang on.

I know exactly how you feel. - I'll do the hair once you're in the gown. - I'll go change. - [sultry music plays] - Wow. - I think this might work. [laughs] - [Margaret] Mm. [clears throat] - All right then. Let's get the van ready. - Right. I was thinking maybe, when this is over, the two of us could spend some time together. Oh, Peter, you know I never plan past lunch. Wow. Should have seen that coming. [door opens] Seen what coming? [exhales] Has it ever occurred to you that every time you start to feel something for someone, you pull away? From me, from your family, from everyone. This isn't the first time it's happened. Oh, please. Admit it, Pemmie. You didn't leave because you had feelings for Hunter. You left because you had feelings for me, and it scared you. Is that what you really think? What I really think is that you're so hurt by what happened to you when we were kids, you're terrified of letting anyone in. You've always got a plane to catch or somewhere to be, just like your mum. [scoffs] I'm nothing like her. - I'm sorry, Fiona. I didn't mean... - No, you meant every word. Let's just stick to business from now on, shall we? Fine. Business it is. Van's ready. [Peter] Brilliant. It'll take us a while to get to Hunter's estate in this weather. I'll be back at four. [Reggie] Should we synchronize our watches? Be ready to go. Pete, I can show you how it's done. It's a button and a twisty-twisty. Come on. Permission to synchronize. That's what it is. Hey, wait up, Pete. Pete! [melancholic music plays] [Fiona inhales and exhales] [car engine revs] I call shotgun. - You can't call shotgun. - [chuckles] Why not? Could it be because we don't want a cat burglar sitting in the front seat? I'll get in the back. - [loud bang] - [Reggie] Ow! - [Reggie moans] - [Frank exhales] I'm fine. I'm fine. [Peter exhales] [Margaret] Wish me luck. [Stacy] Good luck. Just keep Hunter entertained, and everything will be fine. [Margaret] Fingers crossed. [Margaret exhales] [exhales] [car alarm beeps] I hope Margaret can carry this off. Well, she pulled off being me. Remember? [car engine revs] That was different. Hunter Cunard's a criminal. - If something goes wrong... - Margaret can take care of herself. I'm so sorry to interrupt, but, uh, I have an urgent call from Mother Superior at St. Michael's. I told her Queen Margaret was otherwise occupied and that perhaps you could be of service. Oh, okay. Good evening, Mother Superior. I deeply apologize for imposing, Your Highness, but, uh, something important's come up, and I... I desperately need Queen Margaret's help. Uh, well, I'm happy to give her the message. [Mother Superior hesitates] It's a rather delicate matter. You see, the disciplinary committee was set to review Ms. Pembroke's case after Christmas, but, uh, well, I've just received a call, and they've pushed up her review. The committee will be here at seven o'clock. - [gasps] Tonight? - [Mother Superior] Tonight. Now, I really must insist Ms. Pembroke return on the double. [chuckles] Yeah, um, I don't know about that. [Mother Superior] Please! Your Highness, if it's discovered Ms. Pembroke isn't here, then heads will roll, including mine. The committee, well, they may recommend a jail sentence. And not just for her. Okay, okay. I'll... I'll see what I can do. Bye. [exhales] - [Stacey sighs] - What's wrong? We have to get Fiona back to St. Michael's by seven, or she and Mother Superior are headed to the big house. Stacy, Fiona's on her way to Cunard's party. She can't be at the convent as well. No. Well, maybe... No, no, no, no. I know what you're thinking. And no. Absolutely not. It's out of the question. Edward, if Fiona doesn't show up, everything could go south. The disciplinary committee is going to start asking questions that we don't want to answer. Believe me, I don't want to do this either, but I don't think we have a choice. Then I'm going with you. We're a team. Remember? Go, team. [laughs] [car engine revs] [man] Good evening, ma'am.

[exhales] [jazz music plays] So, you never did tell me if you're still in touch with that Peter Maxwell. [scoffs] I haven't spoken to that repellent little toad in years.

[mocking] "Sir, it's Christmas." Get out of my sight. - Now. - [glasses clink] [suspenseful music intensifies] [Fiona exhales] - [sighs] - That was uncomfortably close. Oh. On the bright side, found the keypad. [exhales] [choral music plays] How on earth does she walk in these things? No idea. [exhales] - Are you okay? - [Edward] Well, more or less. Never done anything like this before. [exhales] Yeah, um, just try and be chill. Right, yes. Chilling. [inhales and exhales] [chuckles softly] [Mother Superior] Okay. Come! [door creaks] Ms. Pembroke. [chuckles nervously] There you are. You're very late. Correction, official man. I'm fashionably late. Take a seat. - [Edward] Ladies and gentlemen... - Aren't you... Prince Edward of Belgravia. Ms. Pembroke kidnapped my wife, and I thought, if anybody should be a character witness on her behalf, well, it would be me. But you just said she kidnapped your wife. Yes, I did. And she did, but since then, she has reformed. You see, underneath all of, uh... uh, that, Ms. Pembroke really has a good heart. And yes, she has made some mistakes, but isn't our ability to forgive a measure of our own humanity? Especially at Christmas. [exhales] Is there anything you'd like to add? Everything His Royal Hotness says is true. I've made some hideous mistakes. In fact, if you need to extend my sentence, I completely understand. Actually, I recommend it. - [Edward] She doesn't mean that. - Oh, but I do. - No, you don't. - I do. - No, you don't. - I do. - No, you don't. - I think we've heard enough. I'd like to confer with my colleagues for a moment. - Of course. - Take all the time you need. [cell phone beeps] [cell phone buzzes] [Peter] Damn it, it's not connecting. Try my birthday. December 14th. You and Hunter haven't been together for more than five years. He's not going to remember your birthday. [scoffs] Trust me. I made an impression. - Hm. - Hm. Fine. [keypad beeps] [keypad beeps] [triumphant music plays] [sighs] Here he comes. Well, that took forever. Oh, trust me. It's worth the wait. Merry Christmas. [jazz music plays] Doesn't the duchess of Marlborough have this same bracelet? And matching earrings? Oh. You know, I think I left those earrings upstairs. [tango music plays] Shall we go and fetch them? But they're playing a tango. You always loved a good tango. Then let's dance. [tango music continues] [crowd cheers] [tango music ends] [crowd cheers] [Fiona breathes heavily] [exhales] Are you ready to go upstairs and find those earrings? [pants] So hot. I need water. We've reached a decision regarding Ms. Pembroke. The fact that she was late for this meeting indicates a troubling disregard for authority. Added to her past transgressions, it would appear that increasing her sentence is warranted. If I may be allowed to say, uh, just one more point about my wi... Ms. Pembroke... If you'll allow me to finish please, Your Highness, sir, I said it was warranted, but I don't believe it's the right thing to do. Ms. Pembroke, the committee is very impressed with your sincere remorse. You truly aren't the person we met with before. I truly am not. Based on the testimony of your character witness as well as the recommendations of Mother Superior, we hereby commute the remainder of your sentence. It's a Christmas miracle! [hesitates] Of course we will miss you terribly. Oh, of course you will. Well, we best be going. - [chuckles] - Yes. Thank you very much, and of course, Merry Christmas. [door closes] I'm not sure how I feel about getting Fiona off the hook. - Let's not worry about that right now. - [scoffs] You know, it's deliciously exhilarating engaging in all this skulduggery. - Oh. - [chuckles] - [laughs] Come on. - Ah. [tense music plays] [Peter exhales] [triumphant music plays] [alarm blaring] That wasn't supposed to happen. [groans] Hey. What's that? [alarm beeps] It's a sensor in the gallery. Something's happening. I think it's an alarm. - Well, sort it out then! - I don't know what to do! - Use the laptop! Turn it off and on again. - I don't think that's gonna work! [Reggie] Google it! Take this. [Fiona breathes heavily] [tense music intensifies] [alarm stops blaring] Hold on. It stopped. For now, but the jig is up. You got to get out of there. [grunts] - Maybe the music's vibration set it off. - Yeah. Psst, psst! Psst! Frank! Mayday, Frank. Mayday! Abort the mission. - What? - Get in the van! [tense music continues] [Reggie grunts] [sighs] [exhales] Hm. What about Fiona and Peter? Me and Frankie boy, we're getting out while the getting's good. I ain't ending up six foot under. Okay, I'm coming. Oh God. Hey, hey, hey! [gasps] [alarm blaring] Let's go. [tense rock music plays] Stay here. Oh. But... but... I've... I've cooled off now. - I'll only be a minute. - [exhales] [grunts] - I'll be back as fast as I can. - [gasps] [exhales] [spits and grunts] [exhales] Don't panic. Keep calm and carry on. [exhales] And run. - [alarm blaring] - [pants] - [man 1] Check on that room! - They're coming. Take it. What about you? Just take it. Go. I'll distract them. [man 2] Hey! Over here!

Let's get the hell out of here! Move it, Frank! But Ms. Pembroke is not here! It's everyone for themselves! Come on! - [man yells indistinctly] - [Reggie whimpers] Oh dear. [Reggie and Mindy scream, groan] Over here. Over... Stop! Come back here at once! Frank! [grunts] [laughs] That feels much better. [screams] You're all fired! Do you hear me? No more free vacays and booze! - Oh! What are you doing? - [Mindy groans] Thank God. [Frank screams] Fear not, Ms. Pembroke! - I will save you. - [man] Don't let them get away! [Reggie and Mindy scream] Ms. Pembroke, come with me if you want to live. [scoffs] Go! - Right there! Right there! - Get it! [car honks] [men shout indistinctly] [cheering and laughing] [Reggie] Yeah! [laughs] [alarm blaring] - I'll call the police. - No. No police, idiot. And shut off that alarm. [tense music plays] [all argue indistinctly] [Mindy] I said to him, "Don't go." There you are. - We were so worried about you. - Zsst. Explain. Oh. [scoffs] Well, Mother Superior called, and your disciplinary meeting got pushed up, so I had to be you. But never mind me. Are you guys okay? Well, more or less. There was a bit of a hitch. Peter had to stay behind to create a diversion. But he was able to escape? Well, we still haven't heard from him, so we don't know. [Stacy] Oh. Um... Well, did you get the Star? Of course we did, royal worrywart. [exhales] [Margaret] Uh, Fiona. What is it? [exhales] [gasps and exhales] He switched it. Which means Peter has the Star. He fooled every one of us into thinking we could trust him. After everything we went through? I can't believe it. [Margaret] Fiona. Fiona, you can't feel bad about this. Yeah, it really isn't your fault. Well, then whose fault is it? - We're back! Merry Chri... - We're back! What the... Who the... - Huh? - What's going on? I can explain everything. Which one are you? It's okay, Kev. That's Margaret, not Fiona. - Stacy? - Yeah. - And that's Margaret? - Mm-hmm. - Are you sure? - Let me prove it to you. - No, no, no. - [Margaret] Shh. [exhales] Okay. It's you. - Mm. - Phew. That was really strange. I guess we should call a press conference and let everyone know what's happened. [Edward] I can see the headline now. "Saint Nicholas's Star of Peace gone forever." I suppose we should cancel everything. The tree lighting, all of it. Well, first, let's start by informing Inspector Moretti and the cardinal. They deserve to be prepared before all hell breaks loose. Yes, sir. Oh, um, you should know the disciplinary committee waived the rest of your sentence. - What was that? - [Stacy] No more community service. You're done. [Reggie] You hear that, Fifi? You're as free as a bird. Even so, we're hoping you'll stay and spend the holidays with us. There's a noon flight to Capri tomorrow. We can make it if we leave after breakfast. [solemn music plays] [scoffs] Capri it is. - Yes! - Joyeux Noel, mes amours. Hm. - Hello, dear. - Hello. [chuckles] Mummy, Mummy, Mummy! [Mindy] Manderston Academy? What we doing here? - [Reggie] Looks like a school to me. - [Mindy] Brilliant deduction, Sherlock. [boy] Merry Christmas! I hated school. Skipped most of it. That explains a lot. Hey, Fifi, where you going? - Stop talking. - [girl] Emily, I'm gonna miss you so much! - Me too. Happy Holidays! - [girl] Bye! Have a great Christmas! [mellow music plays] [footsteps approaching] Where's the Star, Peter? I needed to get your attention. [scoffs] I want the Star. And you'll get it. But in exchange, I need you to pop around to the dining hall. What on earth for? [sighs] She wants to talk to you. [scoffing] How dare you tell me what to do? Someone has to, or you'll just go on living an empty, hollow life. [scoffs] So that's why you double-crossed me, to let me know I'm destined to be lonely and miserable? More or less. [scoffs] Do you want to give me what I came here for? Or shall I call the police and have you arrested? [solemn music plays] [Fiona exhales] I know I said I'd always be there for you, Pemmie, but this is the end of the line for us. That's a relief. [scoffs] [chuckles softly] [dramatic music plays] [exhales] [inhales and exhales] [Fiona sighs] Hello, Mummy. [exhales] I didn't think you'd come. I wasn't going to, but Peter said you wanted to speak to me, so go ahead. Speak. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Is that what you've waited all these years to tell me? Fiona darling, we can't go on like this. Oh, I don't see why not. You know, I've spent the last few years traveling the world trying to find some inner peace. Eat, Pray, Love. It's so last decade. [Bianca] That may be. But it was on a retreat at an ashram in Rishikesh that I finally realized that there has been a void in my life. Something missing. And it's my daughter. [scoffs] Fiona. Fiona... I love you more than anything or anyone. I always have. Do you have any idea what it was like trying to be good enough to be noticed by you? Trying to be good enough to matter to you? Better than you think. Oh no, that is a lie. You always had somewhere else you had to be. You always had a plane to catch. I was running away. - [scoffs] - No, not from you. Never from you. Oh. Your father was... Your father was cruel to me, and rather than suffer it, I did whatever I could to get as far away from him as possible. Oh, so you're here to make excuses. [Bianca] No. No, there's... there's no excuse for what I did. You're damned right there isn't. [sniffs and chuckles] I've carried this around for years. Do you remember? You gave it to me when you were ten. [chuckles] [Fiona scoffs] When I was here, I used to steal little trinkets, wrap them up so that on Christmas, I could open them and pretend they were from you. [scoffs] I loved you so much, and I tried. I tried so hard not to care that I wasn't worthy of being loved back. Oh, Fiona, you wonderful, perfect little girl. I... I was a wretched mother, and even though I don't deserve it, I'm... I'm hoping that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Please, darling. Just give me a second chance. [sighs] Well, who knows how many Christmases we have left, you and I? It's too late. [sobs] Fiona.

I know you and I don't have that much in common, really anything in common. - Hm. - [Stacy chuckles] I just want to say I'm really grateful for all you've done. - You could have just disappeared. - Oh, I've actually given up disappearing. Glad to hear it. By the way, how did you convince Peter to give you back the Star? Oh yeah. He intended to, all along. So does that mean he'll be joining us for Christmas?

Well, deservedly so. I gave them the diamond bracelet as well. Did you happen to keep those red heels? Kevin!

[Fiona scoffs] I didn't think I'd see you again. I was mad at you, Pemmie, because you didn't care about me as much as I cared about you. And that's not a good reason to be mad at someone, so... so I came back to apologize. Oh, zsst. Zsst. Zsst. [exhales] It's my turn to apologize. You were right. I do shut people out. It's always felt safer that way. But now? [dramatic music plays] It's what Mummy said. We never know how much time we have left with the people we care about. [sighs] And we can't waste it.
