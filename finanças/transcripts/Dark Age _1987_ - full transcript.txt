* DARK AGE * more than 40.000 years ago. Australian Aborigines lived, in harmony, with their land. A great deal of his animals, they are consecrated. the most dangerous and impressive thing of them, it is the giant salt water crocodile. That the aboriginals of Arnhem Land calls "Numunwari". He needs water. It is well. It is well, face. We go. It is that. what is this night? Pilfer. It is better than the things, what did we have last night. Bean again? It is that again. Numunwari. Relax.

Better time. your lazy bastards. Blue. Oh, going alone then. what do you find, Blue? He knows what He is doing. He is going to need these bloody things, I suppose. We go before he supports the truck on my boat. Is sure what is a good idea? Clear what is. I do not know. He wants the truck and the trailer, in the landing, Jack? No, I will return before, what does the tide bring near. You cannot hunt for crocodiles, tonight. Oh yes? For what not? The special danger of this night. The great companion is outside. Yes, well, when I want his advice, I am going to ask therefore. poor Poor person. Shoulda brought it with us. it Might have used he has bait. I stuck he! Yes, that is of good size.

If it is important, perhaps I should. Jackson, seems and to think, what is big. He will find you in the wharf. Does Garret know? Still not, but Jackson, it will have to turn back that if it is serious. While it links to stop the repetition, of the massacre of last year, it will be worthwhile. I see you Mac. Deligar. Hello. How are you? do I have, these healthy his shells? Oh anne, is your boy? It is yes. What is happening? I still do not know. As were you last night? Without problems. what happened? Where is his boat?

We were taking care of the business itself sinking someone and were fishing. It seems that you did that well and really this time, Besser. I? He was this bastard. He was one of his crocodiles, what did that do. I not. Clear and since they finish where might a croc obtain them? I suppose what the subject poor persons made you take away, it is not? I have not to take away your this shit. You catch the crocodile. Two men are killed and this is his problem. We go, Steve. Cathy? what are you doing here? Finishing my studies. That is good. I did not find, what would you be going to continue with them. There are many things, what do not you know. Still with the department then? As have you been? Is Anything wrong everything all right. ? Nothing changed, Steve. it is not whenever I have a crocodile I murder in my hands. Yes, I know. I feel very much. How much time are you going to be? You are the best. It is incredible, which a little of peace can do. That good to see you. Oh, are you going to be here and when will I return? Perhaps. Lover Croc! Oondabund, this crocodile. I am going to have to shoot in him. Put an end to him. He dreaming crocodile, arranges. Important, for the aboriginal man. cursed Type white companion to put an end to him. He ended with them. That is just. Well, I have a problem, Oondabund. Manners of black companions say, do not kill it. The white man says, kill it. Well, you have he in his way. You try to kill it. But you do not stick he. Link own old man and intelligently, like old persons. Yes. Numunwari, it did not hurt you here. is This his name? Numunwari. Jesus Christ. Where is that crocodile, Oondabund? Perhaps he in this way. Perhaps he in this way. your belly full of Tucker now. Perhaps durmindo, somewhere. He must be ancient, judging for the size. Come already here! We go. Reynolds. Perhaps he has if drowned. Crocodile did not bite it. We go now. To return for Malparinka. we me them have to take it to house. Devil the discussion. He tried to kill that crocodile and the diabolical spirit to catch it. No white subject, it will be able to kill Numunwari. We go. Now! You tie two joined tips. Everything certain one. Even, with the mouth of the basket. Certainty. Put there. Then to weave. Keep on weaving the basket. Not. Not! No! I have! I have! Children, leave! Go out! Go out from the water! Not, not, not, no! Not! When skirt Was Wanted! Not! That it is happening there! Cathy, what happened? He is here. It killed the boy. Oh... Cathy? Go away. Where do you go? Please go away. there is nothing that you could have done. You or any one. It was only a bad luck. because you did not shoot in that crocodile? it is not only to be hoping outside for me, to put a bullet in his head. You think that I knew, what was he going to take that boy? it is that that you find? do You think that I like to see crocs eating persons? Not, but there will be a bad croc thereabouts, you keep an eye on him you throw or do something on that. Look, I would do if I was managing to find it. Everything what I am saying is that you should not judge them like human beings. They do not know, that the children are a taboo. because not to say, that to the mother of a boy? Cathy, I know how you must feel. Not you not. I mind this boy. Like the hell, you do not even like children. Clear that I like children's. Not, do you ever want, it remembers? Well, that is different. Clear. You are certain. Nothing is changed. We do not kill this croc, the whole protection plan is in trouble. do You understand? It will be a season opened in their share. there will be any more none. The white were never happy, with the protection. We are going to play straightly in their hands. Do you come with the people? Help us finding the croc? That boy never did, not difficult at all, for nobody. That boy was sick. He bad chest. Always in the hospital. It Is therefore that it links it took it. You cannot believe in that. You cannot rationalize a death so. And if was his son taken? What would do then? Cathy, please. You do not find Numunwari he not to return any more. Where is he? Where is he going? He is a little frightened now, that crocodile. Go for distant much. Perhaps Sydney. On a few holidays. Mac. Steve. You were not drunk, when did he say 30 feet. This one is, what we think that we would never see, in our lives, Mac. Feather that we have, what to kill it then. Yes. Oondabund, can we talk? Numunwari there. Call, because this crocodile is so special. he said to You. He dreaming crocodile, arranges. You do not stick he, that one is Numunwari. He prepared. Clever he. Like the old persons. He belongs to this river from above, up. Of another country. His Billabong himself. This place is the country of my father. And of his father. And father before that. because he left his Billabong? Bigger rain in this season. Then he comes, for this country. When I was a boy, a my father, he was taking me, for that Billabong and he sang, for that crocodile, appear and it listens. Link not to hurt you, that one is Numunwari. He knows you friendly, of the aboriginal persons. He can say of his eyes. This is good, my old man, but if he kills the persons, we are still in trouble. I go now. Numunwari, wants that I dance. Dance, for Numunwari. You put, this fuel? Yes. I knew that I might not maintain it out of that. We are going to put an end to this and to end with him. did not You understand? Four days and did not it understand? No, but they removed almost the whole rest. How far were you? Total length of the river. the Whole way up to here, it is this way of turn this way even to... Here. one does not preoccupy, it is not going to arrive so far. A crocodile of this size must be easy of finding. We look, at all the places. Perhaps the crocodile has if driven and gone somewhere else. Did the diabos help you? Oh, it seems to be a problem. A problem? It Looks at Steve, I was together with this protection of crocodiles, his thing because I was believing, that there was a future in her, but if you let this type of thing happen, then it is the end of this. The natives, they do not want, what is killed. They say that it is a crocodile, dreamer. again not. It is consecrated. Consecrated? You Punish, he ate three persons. You cannot put, the depressed one in this territory, without any black dictation, that you are having a wee, in his ground of sacred dream. You know of that, Steve. Now you give to me, a good reason, because the crocodiles, they must be protected. You punish one. A good reason. For 200 million years it existed, an animal similar to crocodile, what were here in the time, of the dinosaurs. For 200 million years and us we take them on the edge of the extinction in 20. I do not give the least one, if they are almost extinct. I want a report, on my table, to the 8 of the morning. Helen, bring the plans, for the Japanese condominium. Immediately, Mr. Garret. Where did you get that? Look at the date, at 90. It can be the same crocodile. This might be the painting of Numunwari. Now look at the pole, of the bones here, that the bones of the dead men, they are maintained. Look, for the lines in them. This crocodile, it has the same lines. After you were, they told me another thing. You do not know, what Oondabund, he is the guardian of the crocodile. Since his father was. Like all his ancestors. And when did his father die, they took two of his bones and they gave the Numunwari, the sacred crocodile. As they did, for thousands of generations. Almost from the beginning, of the time. do not You understand? It is therefore that he says, what cannot be killed. Numunwari overdoes, the spirit of his people. For what you, is it really here? I brought you this. I thought, what would be interested. one was interested, it would not have gone out with me, twelve months behind. You seem to administer. What does that mean? You were never so put in order, when do we live joined. I have an employee. Oh yes? Who? Maureen Brag. She is 60 years old. 60? Like his inquiry spectator. She should be 60 years old, was not it? You left, I am not alone, do you know? No, I did not leave. It is therefore that I left. Oh and his work. I was tired of hearing nothing further of crocodiles and like his department, it can save the bloody things. It excuses. Oh, one feels at home. You were always, a good housekeeper. No, nothing a crocodile is left. Write what you will want to write. Mister Garret is still not, Steve. He had just phoned. It will not be even after the lunch. Since it will help! Since the report was? The Best. He still did not read. Oh... That good to see you. It is good to see you also. I have everything solved. What? Knots. You and I. I spent much time thinking about that, I know exactly what it went wrong between us. I know what it went wrong. Cathy, you are of turn. You did not tell to me, that You would come. How do go you, Anne? very good, as have you been? The Best. Well, now that you are of turn, you two must come and have a meal with us. My nephew is arrived, to be next week, link also, he wants to be an anthropologist. Perhaps you could come and talk with him. Give Him some hints. Certainty. I Have, we go, we will never arrive, at home. Now wait. We go. Great day tomorrow. right, everything all right. Well, look after. I give you a ring, cat. Up to tomorrow, Steve. You also. Bye. is It well, where were we? You had everything solved. Right. What is missed with us is not what you think. Good night. The fish that we recommend today is barramundi, grilled with light bunch of pepper. As well as the menu, we have specially of tonight in the blackboard there. I wait that you, be of use his night. what exists of missed with us, you are alone. Cathy! Hi Jerry! I am not hungry. And as for you? Be well... one gives the keys. It is a car of the government. I know. Cathy. Do I Have as it goes, Joe? Still around? I will be for more time than you, companion. Good in you, companion. One abates. Good for you, Steve! His wretch! Drunk idiots! We are going to beat the shit out of him. Go out from here! He is completely his, Jim. You useless old shit Shs, oh... Puts his bottle in his bottom. Done this time, grandad. everything Is very well me saying, that I should go out, but the only way of changing, the system is to make his part. You know that that is not true. Clear what is true. He Knows, I thought in you killed one or two times. was It same? I want to say. When? Once when did you arrive, at home at three hours of the morning, after a day of hard work. I like the idiot what it is, I left from the bed, took away the shoes, did a tea cup. Then I found lipstick, in his underpants. it was not a lipstick. It was a paint of the new pen of crocodile. Foolishness. No foolishness. You must think that I am an idiot absolute. Be well, right, let's be going to have a calm conversation, it remembers? Yes, everything all right. Right, did not I finish telling you... what? On you and I. The reasons for which we are incompatible. Serious! In that. I stayed a little, resolving this, but finally I was right, I find. You? Definitely. Well, it is not my work, the crocodiles, or his driving or his paranoia. What is that? Or I being not much inconsiderate and not much selfish. Oh, saying lies and playing, with what is her name. Wait. And to be crap. And a bad spunk. I understood! cannot he swim? Jim! not now, please. It drugs. For the God's love, there makes sure of what nobody shoots to the sight. are You well, Joe? Yes, I am well. If you link turn, say not to shoot, unless they are sure of hitting the top of the head, with a rifle of high power. They say that it was enormous. How big was he? your head would be of approximately two meters. He was caught sight in the port. Where? Thick wall four. The same thing, will not it be? Clear what is bloody, man. I am surprised, that Garret is not here. It is well. He would declare open season in all that was not human. Harris, is the same thing, isn't it? It looks with that. Because I was not informed? We were arriving near to that. I hope that you are satisfied. That is going to do what happened, in Maningrida it seems a bloody picnic. And the hippies of long hair in the beach? And the persons who fish, do they swim? And the tourists of the south? Mr. Garret, can we obtain a declaration? be no photographies, thank you very much and there are no intelligent articles. Now look, you two. Now that crocodile is here, that means that the shit is ready, setting the ventilator. Then I prepared a press notice, to go out tomorrow scaling that the question, of the crocodiles protection of salt water, it is in revision, waiting for a complete investigation, of what happened, here this night. That must maintain the wolves removed for a while. Now it falls to you. And not to be it, Steve? We have to find it. Better to go out from the water, his friends. There is a croc outside. Foolishness. I had not, a bite to night completely. The trailer is not Yes we have just arrived here. We want the clear area. Be silent and hear! We were there, that thing came and caught me of companion. He was taking care hardly of his business itself. your head was so big, at least. do I see and as you feel on crocodiles now? If you will ask about me I think that we have to, to kill it soon. Now it seems certain, that this is the same animal what was responsible, for the attacks in Malparinga. We are going for the city, Blue. This is a hell of a long travel, Jack. He is near to the main jetty we do not think that we reach it. He is a cunning bastard. It does not admire that he is survived by so much time. Maintain, the light is left he. Slow well down. Put the lights out. There be! It is he, it must be. What is the problem? For the sake of Christ, because you do not shoot? It is a beer can. Par? where was it? Everything what we know, the fact is that definitely it left the port. what is going to happen now? We do not know. It Is the same crocodile, isn't it? It is the same bloody crocodile, what was in Malparinka. Trying to kill myself. He whom useless bastard you did not manage to find. You and his cursed crocodiles. He does not want to catch it, isn't it? You want to save it, for his stench. Steve, please, we go away. I am going to tell you a thing, Harris. If you do not want to catch the bastard, I am going to do certainly, what I do. Steve, he is not worthwhile to be bothersome. Do not bother me. Give birth with that! Leave it alone. Some another hour, companion, h?. Good moment. I Organized recognition airplanes and there is a reward. Five thousand dollars. do You want that all the happy and rude triggers, of the territory aparecam? I thought that you wanted to maintain the distant persons, of the bank of the water, not to mention what is going to do, for the improvement program. I hear! I have a section of wild life, what is supposed to take care of crocodiles. And when do the persons begin to be eaten, who you find, what is responsible? My telephone, it did not stop touching. Lobby of the farmers, owners of stations, Press of TV of the south. I even had a connection of Japan, me wondering, what it is happening. They want to build a tourist complex here. Hundreds of jobs. Thousands. But if they find, that we cannot get rid of a bloody crocodile, they go for another place. The investors are nervous and I do not blame them. The one Who would like to come here, to pass a vacation, when is a chance to be eaten by a crocodile? more important Questions here, of what the survival of a crocodile I murder. All the future of this area is in play. do You realize that? it is persons who count, for me. Not bloody fossils, of the Stone Age. This thing should have been killed years behind. The only place for a thing of this, is in a museum, stuffed! Now I said to a Minister, that the problem is resolved. I am saying, link it what this finished. Only the hot coals dying, to put out. I must have this head. Steve, because you do not speak, with Oondabund? Oondabund, what? It is a tribal old man of Malparinka. Oh the best. That is exactly, what do we need. Oondabund will not help me, killing it. What is the point? Hardly tell him, what it is happening here. It is the only hope, what do you have. much time ago behind, the crocodile was a man but it swims in order that he eats. Then he jumped in billabong, it changed in crocodile. He is great Tucker, he grows and it was in other rivers and all they have trees. He lost, that Numunwari. He to leave his camp, in the stone country and now it does not manage to find his trace at home. He lost. Do you know where to find it, Oondabund? He comes. See white companion it changed his country. See what it happened, with the aboriginal man. All of they have boats. Cursed arms. I see great death. You persons frighten this crocodile. This great problem, did he see? Always with fear. You frighten the animal, he kills. You mark my words, same that you humanize them You frighten the man, kill. The aboriginal man respects this crocodile. He is different, me them he was right in living same as you and I. I have to return now, Oondabund. do You come with me? Help Us finding Numunwari? I want the bastard killed in 24 hours, Harris. what do you want to say? Shoot in him. You know, arm. Bang, bang... What is the problem? You said to him, were not you? I go for house Malparinka. Since I said, it is a loss of time. Conceal the mouth, Garret. He leaves to go. You white men, they think that they are intelligent. to Deceive East Oondabund. Wait for a minute. What is the point? They are all equals. Hold out. Hardly wait. Oondabund, this crocodile is killing persons. I have, what will stop that. I do not want to hurt it, but I have not another choice. Oondabund, tries to understand. That tall subject, Garret, he is my biggest chief. He told me that I have, that to do something, well I have to do that. And this croc has to be stopped. He lost, that Numunwari. He marries in the stone country and he lost. Yes and we cannot simply leave it there. Now he might be hunting for some child in the beach. You try Numunwari finishes that and he they arrive up to you. You hear my words, with much care because you die of that. what diabos must I do? We are from the same side, for the God's love. You know what you are in play. It has to help me. Oh, because I should worry? Nobody more does it. While there will be some trophy, some blood then, well the hell with that! Furious shit. You do not resolve problem killing car. Sometimes white you are not very clever. You are going to say to me, how will it resolve the problem? We catch that Numunwari, bring back his country itself. Catch it? to Catch It living creature and to bring it back? can We catch it living creature? Then, what will you be going to do? Take It to the ancient creation bay. it Is isolated, is big and it is empty. And then what? Another genuine capture. Nobody would say in a million years if the same crocodile will be. Specially if you will guarantee, that they all are killed. We are the Civil Service, not the secret service. Correct! This crocodile, it is only. the only one of this size Must be in eras it left in whole world. It has much more than hundred years, for Christ's love. Probably here in top before, of the white registration. The idea all is absurd. I do not find, that you have choice. Oh, yes what I do. You order it of turn, for Malparinka. As you know, what would he find? He is confident of what he is working where he is. If the price of Oondabund is the croc, it does not matter if it is alive or dead, provided that it is captured. Thank you. Who would leave, with you and he? His son. I am not assuming responsibility. Nobody is asking, for you. Well, it seems that it depends on us. I want a history, in paper. what he is then? He wants a declaration in writing of which the crocodile is of him. I am not signing. one does not preoccupy, I will do that. "SERVICES OF WILD LIFE OF the NORTH OF the AUSTRALIA" I know where it is this Numunwari. They are arrived. Only the girl has nearly 10 men with her. I thought that you said he, he was going to be only two men I gather. This was our plan when, I left from the camp. I cannot help, she changed her mind. What difference does it do? We surpass he. I redden... The food is on the table, Oondabund. If the girl tries to escape in this direction, to follow it independently of any other thing. He turned the painting around. We have of verifar, if it was it was same thereabouts! It is a bad sign, is not it? We go. I have not great choice. Yes you have. to Return. And let Garret have his way? because you always have, what to be a hero? it is not that that one treats. Is not it? You are not an aborigine. You cannot do, their things of the way. Our way certainly, it did not take us to any place. He is a good fighter, that man the cowboy. Great enemy of the mafia, he fights alone. When it waits to be of turn? Do not wait for me. I would like of you are here when to be, with the carcass. Yes, I bet what you would do. Is it true that his work is in the line? Mac, might you take care of that? Certainty. We go, friends, this is a difficult situation. So that we will have something, we will inform you. You forgot this. Thank you. Though I do not think that I am going to do very well with this. I do not know of the one who is his thickest skull or of that crocodile. I wait to see you in the morning. I also. Another beer, Jack? Everything all right. What spunk is this? Jesus, now what do we have? It must be big. It is probably only a shark-coast. Must be! Perhaps is this croc? Be what it will be, it disappeared now. Apposition what there is a great dirty hole, in this new net. It costs a fortune to me. It is necessary to have been a croc. What more might be? Ear, Blue! Any chance of which the crocodile is this way is an insect. It is near to the mouth, somewhere. because you find, what is going do I laugh above? They look for fresh water when they are, with thirst and he should have drunk. can I do anything, for you? No, hardly wait. And the radio? He wants what I check, with you? it is going be only the luck that they are bringing near when the radio was. We will call you. Shit, the bastard returned. Oh Christ, is he. That one is he, companion. Five thousand dollars, in his value. what are we going to do? Where do you go? what are you doing? It is imprisoned, Jack. One lets drown. It is a worm. I am going to show to this bastard Harris, they are all worms. Leave to drown, kill. You are going to come and to help me, pushing this boat? Jesus. do You want, that I feed you with him? to Push! Oh... Companion! Jack! Jack! Jack! your arm! His arm! He caught his arm! The arm fills. take Me to the boat. Jack, help me! what diabos happened here? Fresh air now, this water.

We have he! We have he! Hold that! Hold that! He is rolling. Care, Oondabund. He is rolling. He comes soon. Now. Can I catch a dart, you find? Try. Look, he arrived well near. He is moving. Adjaral!

We had a battle, but we catch it. is It killed? What? did You kill it it is that? Clear that not. The agreement was, to maintain it living creature. Where is he? The crocodile is imprisoned in mangrove swamps. Oondabund is with him. Tied, is that? And being taken care well. Well, not for much more time. What is happening? There was another attack the last night. We go. We are going to take, a coffee cup. Two fisherman. One of them was Besser. He lost an arm. Besser? Apposition that Blue Noakes is different. Fisherman, this is a laughter. They were hunting. We saw his net. furtive Hunters or not, they are persons. If someone will touch that crocodile, they are going to repent. It Is alive, everything well and is so that it is going to be. This is the agreement that we did. This is the agreement that you did. Yes and it is. If you want to kill this crocodile, speak with Oondabund. Get his permission. This crocodile belongs to him. We did this! Settle! Loudly! Well, what do you find of him? He is incredible. Who is going to take care now of that crocodile? I suppose what it is. No good white man takes care of him. aboriginal Man he needs. Link special business, that Numunwari. What about Coming to live here? Perhaps does his place camp? Oondabund, can I touch it? He was tired now. It bit too much. is It a beauty, n?? quite funny, this crocodile.
