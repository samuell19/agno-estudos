Interview, take one. Slate. Are you guys making a film about mothers and daughters? - Yeah. - So that's what... I've basically spent a lot of time interviewing... um... different women, - women from all across the board, so... - Wow. I have a hard time imagining calling my mother "Mommy." That would be, uh... That would be weird. What kind of mother are you? Um... Uh, I think I've been a... Uh, a responsible daughter. I've been the only child, which means that there's a... You know, there's a burden, I suppose, but it's a burden of love. Can you describe your mother for me? Let's see... My mother... To be the mother of a daughter? Yeah. It's a hard thing to... Describe. Ehh, other than it's very, very close. Rachel stood by the shore, the waves from distant lands lapping gently at her feet. She had longed to be here. Struggled against everything to find her way to this moment. Her mother's jealousy had almost succeeded in destroying this chance, but she had made it. And now she was alone. Perfectly alone. Would he come as he had promised? She could not be sure. But as her heart fluttered in the tropical breeze, she knew that she would find him. Somehow, they would be together. It was her destiny. As she turned up the beach, toward the sun-baked villa, her long white dress billowing around her wet legs, it was unmistakable: The strong, angular silhouette... The perfectly tailored suit... He had come. She knew he would. She ran up the cobblestone pathway and wrapped herself in his arms. Her faith had carried her to this moment. The end. Thank you. Thank you, so much. They're very beautiful. And thank you all so much for coming. Honey, would you take these? Smile. Smile! - Step right up. - Hi. - Thank you. - Thank you. - What is your name? Brenda. Yeah, was that you? In the audience? - That's okay. - I don't know... You uh... Usually there's a little sign that... that reminds people to turn their phones off - before they... - Right. They go into a public reading, or something. - Yes. - That's okay. For next time. We'll just... Yep. How... do you... Do you really find... Communication and intimacy... with these people you don't even know? I just... I... I want to be authentic with my fans, but I... I don't know, Rebecca, I just find it so difficult to be just... real with them, you know? And you know that part when I was, like, reading in the book? When I was doing... The part of the reading where Rachel goes down to the water, and she leaves her horse up at the stable... and, and uh, and, you know, he comes up behind her, and like... It's enough! Okay? It's enough. This is exhausting. Listening to you... This is exhausting. This is exhausting me. I just wanted to ask you about an audience reaction. I thought, as... As someone there with an inside eye, I thought maybe you could give me some feedback on my performance. That's all. Well, I'm trying to go. I'm late. Where are you going? I told you where I was going. Well, you'll have to forgive me. I don't remember where you're going. When you asked me to go to the reading, I told you I had somewhere to be, and you promised we would be home. But we were not home on time, so I'm late. - And you haven't noticed... - Rebecca! - that I'm trying to do something... - I couldn't have left any sooner than I left. That was the opening reading of my new book! If you had to go someplace, you should have just gone! You should have gotten in a cab and gone... I would have gotten in a cab if I had known! Ow! God! Your relationship with your mother is the closest relationship you have, - or one of the closest, or the most distant? - Um... I mean, how would you define it in that way? I would say it's the closest relationship that I have. Such as it is. You know, I... And... And... It was... Again, another just uncontrollable explosion. An explosion. What do you mean by explosion? You know, one of her... One of her violent reactions, you know? Her inability to manage her feelings, and... and she blows up at me. Has she hit you? Yes. - Really? - Kate, my stomach was in knots. It was churning. Hey, man, slow down! Damn! According to... our records, you have... less than $10,000 in your RSPs. You have almost nothing in your savings account. It's not a positive situation, and it's not... It's not something that we want to see you in. We ran into a little difficulty a few years ago. - My... My husband... - Right. was made redundant, and he's... But he's retrained, and... has a very good job now. Well, we don't have that in our records. How long has he had this job for? Eight... Months. Really? Excuse me. Do you need some help? It'll stop in a minute. It's fine. You can answer it if you want. Oh, um... - Okay? - Yeah. Okay. Uh... So you were saying your husband has a new job that he started eight months ago. Do you know why, then, no money has been put into your savings account? We've seen no action, actually. We've only seen withdrawals for... almost close to a year. What's the happiest... memory for you of being a mother? When she was a baby. - Yeah. - Can you talk about that? Oh, there's nothing more miraculous. I had... a great pregnancy. I was so thrilled to have her. And she was such a beautiful baby. She was big. Nine pounds, six ounces when she was born. Huge. And, uh... I was lucky with her, you know. She... Well, she didn't sleep through the night, and she did have colic for a bit, but... it... It didn't matter. And I just... We were... We were very close for the first two-and-a-half years. And then... Dice! - Hey! Hey! - What? Easy. Take it easy. Don't bust up the place, okay? Good. This is what I want you guys to do: I want you to scrape all this stuff really well, and a good strong primer on it, okay? - Got it? - Got it. All right. I'll have a hot chocolate, eh? All right. I don't care if it's on fucking city property. I don't want the tree. So just figure out a way to cut it down. - Hi. - Hi, Miss Anderson? Yeah. I'm Celine. Um, we spoke earlier. Um, Celine? Oh. Hi. - Hi. Sorry. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Uh, come on in. So this is the room here. Let me just get the color that I was thinking of. Um, so... Vanilla cinnamon. I think it's just a little bit brighter than the color that I have in now, and it'll give the room a little bit of warmth. Oh, yeah, um... It would. - Cynthia? - Mm-hm? You want to come and have a look at this? As far as I've gotten, See if it's really what you want? We can still change it, you know? Mmm-hmm. Before I get too far. Oh, that's beautiful. - Oh, you like that? - Wow. - Great. Good job! - All right. Uhh, what an asshole. Oh, the princess awakens. Honey, turn the light off. It's daytime. - I don't want the light on in the day. - Good morning. You need it for your eyes. But it wastes electricity. But your eyes are more important than electricity. I cannot believe this book review. This guy doesn't know what he wants to say. Listen to this. Okay: " As Day Turns To Night, the beautifully rendered, utterly forgettable..." "Beautifully rendered." "Montrose delivers everything her readers want, and nothing more." -"Everything her readers want." - No, no. Listen, listen. "As Day Turns To Night is classic Montrose. "She takes her readers where they want to go, "tucks them into bed with an eiderdown quilt, "and lets them drift into a gentle slumber, "the sounds of distant lapping at the tree-lined shores to soothe them." Yeah? What's wrong with that? - What a "fuck you." - You're crazy. - This guy, Rod Ruell... - That's not a "fuck you." You're crazy. No, I... I don't drink coffee. Since when you don't drink coffee? I stopped drinking coffee today. - I don't drink it. - Well, why did you put out two cups - beside the bodum? - I... I just... It was by habit. But I'm not going to drink it, Thank you very much. And you should be drinking something different. - The things I've read - I like coffee. I'm going to drink... - about caffeine... - Oh yeah? - Very bad for you. - Fuck, don't have it, then! D-don't spill it! I'm not going to fucking throw it at you! God's sake! - You almost burned me! - Oh, come on! - You are such a PRIMA Donna, my God. - You didn't have to waste it! - God, you're hyper. - You just waste everything. - Stop reading this. - I'm reading it. It's important to me. - Why read it if you don't like it? - I like the picture. You pick out all the negatives. There's lots of positives. But you choose - Isn't that good? - Yes, the picture is good. - Yes, it really is. - Yes, it is a very nice picture. - They gave me half the page. - I think that they... They did not airbrush it. Don't even start. Airbrushed you a little bit there, but... Since you're in a good mood... Can I bring Dice to the party? No. What? You have a hell of a nerve. This is a party I've been planning for a long time. This is coming after my book launch. It's a big party, I've got a lot to do today, and you're asking me if you can bring to the party somebody I don't like? - But I like him. - Yes, but I... No. - But I like him. - No, Rebecca But I like him. But I like him. - Why is that such a problem? - I don't want Dice here. I don't like him, and you know that. I don't approve of your... - relationship. - so why can't you just put up with it for me, so that I can have company? Because it's my party and my house! Every day is your fucking party. You're not bringing Dice to the party. That's all there is to it. - He is coming. - No, he's not. Just because your friends... - are snobs. - It's my party and my house! Your friends talk shit about everybody! I mean, this is the kind of person that, what, you would prefer I was with? - He's not coming. - Somebody who... Who is... talentless fraud, and because they're so frightened, - He's not coming! - they have to downgrade everyone else they come into contact with! - He's not coming! - It's a suffocating environment, and I'm not coming either! I was a single parent, you know, so there wasn't, uh... You know, she didn't... Wasn't between me and her father. Her father died when she was young. Uh, my husband. And, um... Uh, and so, I don't know, we kind of... I think that she grew up being, um... Like a pal to me. I guess I don't feel that that's really been a healthy thing for me. That I don't think it's my place as a daughter to be a companion. That that's really the role of someone else in her life. That I should be the daughter, and she should be the mother, and she should... take care of me. I don't know if it's right to have it be a relationship like that that's Not that it's too equal, 'cause equal is good. But it... It is a little... It is a little... I'm not sure it's right for us to be... Buddies. Ow. Ugh. Are you okay? Yeah, sorry. I just thought I was going to get sick for a second there. Oh, maybe you're pregnant. This paint's not getting to you, is it? No, that can't be the reason. No, it's a... It's non-toxic. I'll be fine. Did you eat? What did you eat? I didn't eat today. Well, there you go. Have something to eat. Get some fresh air. Oh, yeah, I've got my computer and everything else. I don't really want to leave the house. Don't worry about it. It'll be okay. Oh, no, no, no. I got no use for those things. No, I didn't... I didn't mean... You know what? You're right. I'll just... I'll go for a walk. I'm somewhat recognizable, you know. I'm a sort of a... I'm a celebrity, - here, in town, and... - Mm-hmm. Are people going to know that I had work, if I have... - If I mess it up, yes. - Oh. We try to be as unobtrusive as possible. - Wow. - The trick is not to over-pull and look like you're in a wind tunnel. - If you improved your hydration... - Yes? You'd find that your skin will not stay up as much like Play-Doh. - You know how you start to get - Yes. like a chickeny flesh? Well, that can improve it, too. Well, what concerns me is the whole thing is falling. Ah. It's gravity and aging. - Yeah, gravity. - Then you want a non... What we call a non-surgical face-lift. So you do Botox to stop the frowning - and the negative emotions. - Yes. And then you put filler in to build up the eyebrow area, to build up under the cheeks, build up the nasal-labial line, build up the corners of the mouth to lift them up a bit, And even build up by the chin to stop that little "s bend" from the jowls. It literally can take off about four to five years of look on your face. - Wow. - Which is phenomenal. There's no surgical risk. You may not look as young as your daughter, but it will achieve a freshness and improve your own self-esteem. Why do we have our hair done, buy nice clothes, - put make-up on? - Mmm. We do it because it makes us feel good. - It makes us feel positive and energetic. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Oh! - Guh! So do you... Would you say your mother's a good role model for you? As a kind of um... person you would want to emulate? Would I want to be like my mother? Oh, that's a tough question. Honestly, my relationship with my mother is... It's a little distant. Um... I... would say I'm much closer to my father. Gordon? No, it's me. It's Kate. Kate! What are you doing here? I'm expecting your dad any minute. Why haven't you been answering my phone calls? Your phone calls? What are you talking about? I've phoned you for the last day and a half, Mum. - Oh, was that you on the phone? - Yes! I was so embarrassed. I was at this reading, and... And my phone just kept going on and on. And I... What... What's with this? What's going on? Well, I'm expecting your dad for dinner. He... He's been away for an entire week. I thought he was coming last night, but I think I got it wrong. Anyway, he'll be here tonight. - Do you want to have supper with us? - You didn't read it, did you? What? - You have to sit down. - What is it? I need you to sit down for a minute, okay? Why? Has something happened? Yeah, it has. Are you all right? Is everything all right? Dad um... Dad, uh, cc'd me on an email he sent you, which you obviously didn't read. Um, and sent me a note saying that he wanted me to make sure that you... got this. So, um... What does "cc" mean? It doesn't matter. Why would he email me? He knows I hate that machine. He's coming any minute. Why can't he tell me... "My Dear Brenda, I know it must seem strange coming to you in an email, but I thought I would be best able to express myself in a letter. So I hope you will understand what I'm about to tell you. As you know, my life has been turbulent for some time now, what with the change in my profession, the need for retraining, and all the drama that I have been through. I know I explained to you that I had been hired by a new firm shortly after the retraining course was finished, but that was a lie. And I'm ashamed to admit it now, but I thought you should know the truth because I respect you." He doesn't have a job? "Although I have not yet found employment in this new world of high-tech design, I remain enormously optimistic about the future." So that's what she meant... "The retraining at the college has turned into a double blessing for me. Firstly, by giving me the hope for a second chance in my profession. And, secondly, for giving me new life on a personal level. You may remember a young woman named Gloria, who first taught me computer design. She has been a life-saver, and I have found great happiness with her. We have been seeing each other secretly for the past three years, and now have been blessed with a child. A baby boy that fulfills a lifelong dream of mine. You have always been an important part of my life, and I hope you will come to understand that Gloria and the baby are a new part of our family tree, a branch which represents a fulfillment of my needs. I hope you will, over time, be happy for all of us. Love, Gordon." Is this a joke? It must be a joke. He has a baby. He has a baby boy? He's 58 years old! He hates changing diapers. Have you ever tried to find your birth mother? No. Are you not interested in finding your birth mother? No. So it's not a very happy topic, the mother and the daughter, for you? How would you feel if you were walking down the street with your parents, and some lady came up to your mom and was like, "Oh, how much did you pay for her?" Would that make you feel good? Celine? Did you go upstairs? Yeah, I went up to the bathroom. Why would you go into one of the other rooms? I never went into the other room. - Yes, you did, - What? because the door is open to the room. I don't know why I trusted you. Okay, your type of people always do this kind of stuff. What the hell? What type of people? You know, your type of people that do this kind of work. And what type of people are you? Stick to what you have to do. Don't go anywhere else in the house. You know, it's very unprofessional. I'm nothing but professional. - Well, then... - What would I want to do, go looking around in your room anyway, huh? I don't know. Why would you open the door? Why would I? Let me see. What's in that room? What the hell is in that room that I would want to see? - Come on! What would I want to see in there? - No! You don't... - It doesn't matter! - What do I need in there? Come on, show me what I need in there right now. It's not important what's in the room. Come on! You just don't need to go upstairs. - Come on. Show me. - No! What? What is it? Just get out of here. It doesn't matter. You just shouldn't have been here, okay? Just don't come in here again. - I never was in here, okay? - Then... Then you... Goodness. Ohh. Here. You know, I never went in there. I don't go into people's... private places. I don't. I can't afford to do that... People like me. - Here's the place I was... - Mom, I don't wanna go shopping. - Come on! Don't be silly. - I don't want to go! Let's just go in. This was the one... that I picked out for you. Are you kidding? No. Look. Look at it. Come on. Just stand still. It's black... - Except that there's a... - Except for this. But that's the bottom. It's away from your face. - I know you like black. - Are you kidding me? Look at that... Oh, it's just so beautiful. - Oh, thank you. I know. - It's so beautiful. - Are you being sarcastic? - Yes, I am. - Sarcasm is so weak. - God, you're quick. You are so terrible. Excuse me? Salesgirl? - Can I... Can I ask you a question? - Okay. So if I walked into your store looking the way I do, is this something you would pick out for me? Um... I probably would, because it's personally one of my favorites. But there's a lot of other stuff... But does it look like something I would enjoy wearing? Um... I think you should try it on - and then you'll be able to tell better. - See? And do you work on commission? No, I don't. Try this on. Go on. - Try it on. - No, I'm not. No. - Excuse me? I wonder... - I don't want it. Sorry. Would you do me a huge favor? Oh, it's so beautiful. Look at the detail. She's a beautiful girl. You know, if you ate more, you would actually fill out a little better. And you would look at a dress like this and know this would just flatter you. So beautiful. - You look really good in this dress. - Thank you. Thank you so much for doing this. We're going to buy this dress. - Oh fuck. Don't... don't buy it. I'm not going to wear it. - I am. - I'm buying this dress. - I'm not gonna wear it. If you buy it, I will throw it in the fucking garbage. Thank you for all your help. That was lovely. I do once and a while... I'll hear... Something will come out of my mouth, and I'll be like, "Fuck. That's my mother." I hear it. I know it's in there. Just... Yeah. That is one of my great fears, actually. I don't want that. But I hear it. I know it's there. But sometimes... That line is blurry. Because... There's this person who... Who looks like you and who... sounds like you increasingly on the phone as they grow up. And people say, "Oh, hi. I thought you were your mother." Or, you know... I sometimes... hear my own mother's voice in my voice. and I've done everything to separate myself from my own mother. - Hi. - Hi. - Is that everything for you? - Yeah. $14.53 is your change. Whoops. - Sorry. - Sorry. And here's your receipt. - Okay. Thank you. - Thanks. Okay. Bye. Do you have, sort of, ideas about who your parent... your mother, your birth mother, might be? Do you ever have those kinds of thoughts, like... Imaginings? You must... You must wonder. Sometimes I wonder, but... I can't see her being a good woman. I mean... She gave me up. What kind of mother does that? - Can I help you today? - Yes. I don't want my regular, exotic stuff. I think today I would just like something very simple. Something that says... "poverty." Poverty? Okay. Tulips say poverty. The Dutch are poor. - There you go. - That's beautiful. Thank you so much, Sasha. You're very welcome. Nice to see you. - Thank you. I'll see you soon. - Okay. - Have a nice day, Micki. - Bye. She's done it again! Whoo! Yes! Bravo! - Speech! - Bravo! Bravo! Speech! I need a drink! To all my dear friends... And fans. Yes, we're friends, and we're fans. Huge fans. Yes, yes, Bruce. Are you negotiating the movie rights? Because I know this will be a hot property. Well, uhh... You know, it's uhh... It wasn't peddled to any agent or anything. - Apparently... -"Peddled." That's a good word. A very uhh... A famous actress got to read it. Yeah, yeah. Who? - I'm not supposed to tell. -Please, come on. You can tell us. So it's already in the works? I'm not supposed to tell anybody. I'm sorry. I can't! - Your stuff's clearly... - Sounds like? Um... Oh, let's do that. Let's do that. Sounds like? Your... Your work... - I just know that a young, hot actress... - Yeah. Yeah, well... - has been interested in playing this role. - -I think that's fantastic. The book is clearly tailor-made for... - Hollywood fare. No question. - Is something wrong with that? - Because the turning points... - That's not a bad thing. Streetcar Named Desire, asshole! Streetcar Named Desire! Major motion picture starring the finest actors possibly ever. And is that a bad thing? - The turning points all... - -Why do you keep making her success - happen at perfect moments -into a bad thing? The resolu... I mean, actually, when I read it, I felt like I was watching something on a... On... on television, uhh... And I swear there were even some commercials. I'm just saying it had that kind of soothing... It had that kind of soothing effect where I could actually... not really... - sort of take in a couple pages. - -Let me assure you, Thomas, I did not write this book with the idea... of leaving spaces for television commercials. I'm just saying that... Well, then, maybe it's just your innate ability... - Shut up. - -Maybe it's your innate ability - We're not enjoying this. -to write for... for that way. Look, I'm... I'm en... We're all enjoying ourselves. - We're here to celebrate... - -Well, some of us stopped enjoying ourselves. - Tom! - Success is one... We all appreciate... We're all bourgeois at the core, so we like to have the wine... You're the only one born into money, Thomas. And we like... And we like to, you know... But the fact is... It's just, you know, it's... It's... I think there are a lot of things in the world - to be concerned about... - Wow! That was electrifying. - That was an electrifying summation. - -Shut the fuck up! - Would you just shut up? - That was a truly... electrifying summation of all your feelings... Your jealousy of her success... Yeah, right. Jealousy, right. We're not trying to position the work as a classic. What's it like being the two smartest guys in... What's it like being the two smartest guys in the room all the fucking time? The book is a soap opera, basically. That's why it's making so much money. I agree. Then you and I other than someone else at the table is talking some sense. She doesn't think it's a classic. Do you? - Do you? - Well, certainly not yet. - What... - What "yet?" It's never going to be a classic. - When... When is it... - Well... You don't... It's a soap opera. That's why it's doing so well. But... But no! How does... How is... Micki, God bless you. God bless you. You're a wonderful woman. You're a wonderful hostess. - I love you... - It's not a classic. - But your book is not going - Maybe, Thomas! - to be going into a time capsule - Thomas! - that will represent the apex of our age. - Thomas! Maybe if you had a little personal success of your own, you wouldn't feel so hostile... - That's a very subjective term, "success. " - towards me... and my success! I mean, I... Just a minute. Is that not a... a... - a valid point? - Thomas, we all know... We all know that you're a cunt. But we're here tonight to celebrate Micki. And as Oscar Wilde said, -"Don't value your opinion over my feelings." - Thank you! This is Micki's night. Yes, it is. I'm just... But you two are... You two are negotiating movie rights as we speak, correct? Because it plays... It plays beautifully as a movie of the week. Come on, stand up. Put your fucking money where your mouth is. - It plays beautifully as a movie of the week. - Let's go! Come on! - I'm just telling you that. - Look at me, motherfucker! - Hey! Hey! C'mon! En garde! En garde! Come on! Beware jealousy! It is the green-eyed monster! You are in no position... You are a fucking shit salesman! You don't care if you're selling toothpaste or fucking... You'll sell anything they shove at you. You're a fucking shit-eating shit merchant! - Son of a bitch! - I have some shit... That's enough! That's enough! Wait a minute... We're shit-eating shit merchants! Sure. Everyone knows what to do but me. Oh, for goodness sake. Get a grip. Get a grip. Get a grip. Get a grip! Get a grip! Stop looking at me. Shut up! As if I didn't know. Oh, that's better. Stop looking at me. Oh, god. Where are you? Stop crying. Stop crying! Are you in there? Hello? Are you in there? It looks nice. Yeah, it's getting done. You're not looking too good. Are you okay? Yeah, the sickness. It just won't go away. Did you go to the hospital, or... Um, no. I went to the drug store. I'm pregnant. Is that okay? I guess it's going to have to be. I'm not ready. You're going to have to be. Oh, you're scared. Are you all by yourself? No. I have... My parents are... My parents are around. I can't tell them. Why? I mean, if your daughter got pregnant, and she wasn't married, and the father was a one-night stand, wouldn't you be disappointed? No. I wasn't. But a baby is a baby. You know what? I'm going to go, um... I'm going to go fix you some soup, okay? - No, that's okay. - Yeah. I'll fix you some chicken noodle soup. Okay? I'm not sure I'm going to have a daughter. I'm not sure I'm going to have kids. Why not? I don't... I don't know that I could do a good enough job. I don't like the pressure, the implied pressure, that I could fulfill the next phase in her life by having children. Not that she's ever said it outright, but... It's... it's... You know, it's there. "When are you," you know, "when are you going to give me grandchildren?" I don't like that. I just think... children are the most amazing... people in the world. I just love children. I would have had more if I could have, you know. And... What's wrong? Oh, just... Just the... Just... Traffic. It's just... Drives me nuts. Garbage. Garbage. Rebecca Montrose. "Portrait of an Artist as a Des-par-ate Women." No. "Desperate Woman." Idiot. Tonight! Oh, man, all right! Yes! Save. A definite save. Hi, honey. What's going on? Nothing. I'm just trying to see... You know, honey, you can't blame him. I mean, look at me. Look at me. Look at what I'm wearing. Everything... is beige. Mum. Look at this body. - I used to be pretty. Look at this. - Mummy. Mummy! Look at this! I mean, where did it all come from? I just... It's like my hobby's been eating for the last... Sixteen years? I don't know. And they said when I was breastfeeding you that my breasts would sag. And I breastfed you for two-and-a-half years. They all said that was ridiculous, but... They didn't sag then, but now they're sagging. - Look at them. - Let's... Let's... Let's sit down. You know, I think the problem, really, was sex. When it comes down to it. I can't remember when we last had sex. Sit down. Even when we did have it, it wasn't very good. You know, your father, he didn't... He didn't like to, you know... Go down. - That's pretty - And I think that's important for a woman... To have a man go, you know... Go down. Here. I can't stop thinking, like... What am I going to do? Who's going to hire me? You don't have to worry about that. Before you were born, I was a waitress. But I don't think they hire waitresses at 54 years old, do they? You don't need to be a waitress, Mum. You're fine. Maybe at a truck stop or a diner. but I don't suppose the tips would be very good there. I don't know. I'm going to have to think of some kind of job. You know, you don't need to worry about a job. Oh, but I do. The bank manager told me... Well, she didn't say that I had to worry about getting a job, but... I have to start paying the mortgage payments. What do you mean? See, I thought it was all under control, because I thought your dad was working, but... Instead he was having a baby. Oh, well. Kate? It's a bit of a pickle, though. It's a bit of a pickle. But it's actual... - Kate? - I can't... What is it, honey? - Oh, baby. - Mum. Kate? What did... Okay, well, how long? Okay, thank you. Celine, do you know anyone that can cut down a tree? What tree are you trying to cut down? Here, I'll show you. This one. - Really? - Mm-hmm. It's fine now, but in the summer, it's got these apples, and they drop on the car, and then birds sit in it and shit on it. That's its job. That's what it does. It's a tree. Yeah, well, my car's parked under it. You know, you shouldn't be uh... cutting down trees when you're carrying life, eh? That's what the old people used to say. You've got to watch what you do when you're carrying life. It's not good to chop down a tree anyway. Your daughter's lucky. She has someone that knows what to say all the time. My daughter is not with us anymore. She passed away. - Sorry. - Yeah. I left, but it was too late. I already lost touch with her. Didn't know where she was, and then by the time I get a beat on her, I hear she had that baby and... and lost that baby somewhere in the Foster system. Then I heard the baby got adopted, and no way they'll let you know anything about where that baby is, and then... And then she dies of an overdose. I'm sure that taking that baby is what killed her. Does it hurt? Ah, everybody said it hurts, you know. "You never felt such pain," but... You know, when it's done, it's done. I can't remember, you know. It's past. And it's bringing a life in. A new life. And it's... It's amazing. It's the greatest gift in this creation. New life. And it's the biggest responsibility. You know, you think of creation... That's what it's all about... Creating new life. You honor that. You honor that. What you've got going on right now. I'll help you any way I can. Just don't cut down this tree, okay? Okay. Do you have any smokes? No. Man, that was fantastic. That was... Mmm... Oh, I love your body. I need you to go. Now. She is, um, a poet. A poet. My daughter has chosen, um... I think, a harder road than I chose, um, because it's a... it's, you know, a less popular, uh, art than what I do. Um, and is she famous? Well, uh, you know, she's Micki Montrose's daughter. But I... you know, she has that particular kind of fame. But, um, she herself has not achieved, uh, her own, uh, success, and... But I believe that, um... I believe that she has the potential to, uh... To be great. Because... I think that's... how you have to feel about your children. You know, I'll tell you a secret. I'll tell you the secret of my success. If you want to write, I mean, really write, you have to be a good listener. You know, you have to draw the ore from the minds of humanity. You have to get down on the ground floor and rummage through the kind of lives of people who you'd never invite to a dinner party. I mean, the kind of people whose grit, grime, and depravity make up the raw materials of character. That's... what a great writer can conjure. But I'm not a great writer. So, like I said, it's not about me... Not in the least. Thank you, Rebecca. I don't know. Because I just don't know if people, like... if they're getting what I'm doing. Like, I'm trying to say something about personality and what makes up our personalities. It's just a series of affectations that we adopted when we were young and we hang onto because we're frightened of what else is out there. I mean, if we associate ourselves with being beautiful, what happens when... What happens when people don't... see that in us anymore? When we look in their eyes and it's not... there? They see something else. They see an older woman. They see... Babe, you're beautiful. But I'm not... I'm not... talking about me. I mean, are you listening to me? I'm... I'm totally... I'm right here. So do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. You told me. So what am I saying? Come here. Oh, my God! Just... You don't care at all! I... I totally... What's wrong? I think I have a cold or something. Actually. I'm okay. You didn't make any coffee. You know, tea has as much caffeine as coffee. More. I can't get the thing to work. I don't know where the coffee is, so I guess there's no coffee for me. What's going on? Tell me. Is it a review? Where's your paper? You know not to take those seriously. Is it your friends? Did they say something? I bet they were so happy to tell you that you got a bad review. Because it's... It is insane to me that you even spend time with them Because they're so happy to tear you down. Do you get that? I mean, you know that. When are you going to take responsibility for your life? For your choices? - You know, make new friends! - Rebecca... You have to go. Go where? I don't know. But it's time for you to go. You have to go, Rebecca. You pack your things and you go. I'm sorry. What did I do? You have to get your things and you have to go. Mum? In the dining room. How are you? I can't find my glasses. They're on your head. On my head? You look good. Oh, before I forget, this is for you. This is your cell phone number, okay, and it's got the code that you have to dial so that you can check your voice mail. I hate my cell phone. Yeah, I know, I know, but that's part of life, so... Okay, so, there. What are we doing? What I thought we could do is... Maybe we could make a list of your transferable skills... How is work? - It's fine. - Do you have a lot of clients? Well, yeah, I have enough. It's, you know, starting out. So, um... It must be really hard listening to other people's problems all day long. Okay, um... let's think about, first off, what you would like... to do. What... What do you enjoy? Well, I read. Yeah. Um... What about a book store? I mean, the economy's busy right now. - I think that... - I would rather die. Okay. Um... I could be an editor. An editor? Well, down the road, maybe, but why don't we start with, like, your short-term goals, and then we'll talk about your long-term goals, okay? Do you have a boyfriend? No. No, I don't have a boyfriend. Let's... You know, I've been reading these books for years, and every time I get one, I really look forward to it, and the other day I got this book, and I tried to read it the other night, and then I tried to read it again this morning, and... I can't even get through the first four pages. I mean, I just wonder what I was thinking. Happy endings. They're just... Pfft. Irrelevant. Kate? Kate? He's still your dad. What about an ideal daughter? what's the ideal? Oh. Whoo. The ideal daughter... Do you feel that you're an example of an ideal daughter? I've tried bloody hard. I've tried really hard to be the ideal... I've tried to be the ideal daughter and the ideal son. Do you think you'll have kids of your own? I don't know. If you did, what kind of mother would you be? Hey. I don't want to talk about it. It stinks in here. It's dis... It's... Shh, shh, shh. Hold on. Can you bring me another beer? Nice, nice, nice... Nice! Holy shit! Did you just see that? Watch! Watch! Watch! Boom! Oh, my God, that's gonna to hurt! I'm sorry. I'm just kind of stressed out. - I'm just... - That's okay, Sugar. I'm just worried about my mom, you know? Like, I don't... I don't know. Do you think that I should call her? Was I... Was I too hard on her, do you think? Or like... Uh, it's in the kitchen. What's in the kitchen? The phone. So you... You need the phone? It's in the kitchen. Do you think that I should call her? Is that what you're saying? I'm sorry, call who? Who do you... What are you talking about? Hey. Heyyy! Come on! What are you doing? What are you doing? Holy shit! Holy shit! I don't know why she threw me out, so... It could be anything. It could be nothing. Um... 'Cause she's like that. You know. You talk to her. Yeah. I can only imagine what goes on in here. The drama must be insane. Or maybe she saves that for me at home. I don't know. Maybe with you she's pretty cool, but she comes home and goes nuts. I don't know. And so I guess it's good that she threw me out. Because I can't... I couldn't keep doing that anyway. Because it's just not... It's not fair for her to ask me to give up my life so that I can take care of her. Because she can't... Because she hasn't... She hasn't learned how because she doesn't want to know how to take care of herself. Hmm. Even as a child, I was there to take care of her. And that's not fair. It's a big responsibility. Yeah. And it's not fun. But I'm just worried, so... If you're suffering... Give it a go. Call her, maybe. Well, I'd like to, I guess. I'm not sure... what I would say. What would you say? I don't think it really matters what you say. I think she just wants to hear from you. You'll know what to say when... When you get there. Can I say it without yelling? she wouldn't recognize you without... Yeah. I guess that's the... That's okay. It doesn't have to be the perfect relationship... With her. It just... It just has to be your relationship with her. She's your mother. Car! Hey! C'mon! Okay, I think we should uh... get started. So, uh... Thanks for coming, everybody, to the Grandview neighborhood traffic-calming proposal meeting. The, uh, the idea here is that there's uh... There's been, obviously, quite a... discussion about the increased traffic through the Grandview neighborhood. And so we're looking at proposals, various ways to divert the traffic or slow it down. Now, this is not set in stone. The idea here is to get your input. Hopefully you've all had a chance to look at the various proposals that we've sent. So I can just open the floor up for any discussion. Yeah. According to this particular, uh, design... the street that I'm living on is going to be almost impossible to get to, and I have a very ill husband. And I want to make sure that the ambulance can get there. - I'm on William... - Uh-huh. Which means you have to go around the third block over and then come up Templeton... What about the alley way? Wouldn't the alley way work? A lot of these diversionary measures, speed bumps and stuff, don't really affect the emergency vehicles. I understand the ambulance problem, and that is a very real problem, but... The children are what I'm most concerned about. I mean... The streets are being used by commuters to get from downtown to Coquitlam. They're using our streets like highways. Okay, thank you. Yeah? I also have another question. Again, I live on Williams, and I used to take Garden right down. Right down to work. I work right down the drive, and now I can't do that... - you work on the drive? - What happens is... Yes. - What hap... I now... - Why don't you walk? Excuse me? Well, why are you taking a car down to the drive to go to work? And you're worried about a direct line to work? I mean, that's crazy. I understand that your husband is sick, and you're worried about the ambulances. I think that's a very valid concern, but I think here, we have to think about our community, our neighborhood. This is the world we live in. We live here. And now it's being eroded. Maybe your husband would feel better if he wasn't breathing... carbon fumes all the time. We must give this a chance, and... We've got to slow everything down. Shit! Hey! What the hell? - You're gonna tell me you didn't see me? - Go. I am standing here! - This is a pedestrian precinct. - Go! That is a stop sign! This is a crosswalk. Get off the road, okay? - Don't you... - God! That's it! - What the hell? - Uh... Oh... What the hell's going on here? I, um... Uhh... - Oh, hi. - Hi. Um, the stuff for the Salvation Army is just around on that little path. If you go to the backyard, you'll see all the boxes there. Oh. well, I'm here to do the estimate on the paint job you wanted done. I called Celine Boucher Interiors. Yes. I'm Celine Boucher Interiors. Oh, my god. I'm so... I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. I'm Micki Montrose. I... I must have pictured... Something... come in. Please. It's cold. Okay. Thank you. I was thinking about, um... changing the color in my... In my office, in my study where I write. Um, just something... brighter. You know, something... lighter, I guess. I'm... I'm not sure what, but... Uh, my... Ohh... My daughter... recently... left, and, um... I guess she... took... all... All the color out of the house or something, but... I just need a different feeling in there, so... I'd just like to change it. Do you have kids? - Yeah. Yeah I do. - You know what I mean. Yeah, I certainly do. Well, it's just down here. - Okay. - Make a right. Sometimes when the light's just right, and the day's just right, and the sun's just right, sometimes I feel like she's coming. I'm going to find her. I might run across her, or something's going to happen, or I'll get a phone call... And then other times I think... It's never going to happen. I'm just going to have to find it where it is. I'll just have to adopt somebody. Do you think you'd know her if you saw her? I think I'd know something about her. I think I'd know something about her that she doesn't know about herself. I picked you up some things. Thank you. And that's for you. Wow! Wowww. Baby stuff! This is great. Look up! How did you get up there? How did you get up there? I don't know. Here. You okay? Yeah. - Hello? - Hi. I found a wallet with your phone number in it. I'm wondering if you lost your wallet? Or somebody... you know has? Are you the lady that... Yeah, yeah, yeah. You were swinging your bag at my window. Listen, I... I owe you an apology. Do you think there's a chance that, um... Perhaps we could meet? I guess, to be completely honest, I feel... disloyal... saying things about her because she's a good woman. She's done a lot for me. And... I owe her... so much. You know, she... She could have... She could have been so much. My mum. But instead she had me. I think the ideal mother would be someone who... would want great things for their daughter... But also... Fuck. Fuck. But also, um... Love them without the great things. What would you say to other daughters... people who are daughters... from a mother's point of view? I would say to daughters: Forgive your mothers. 'Cause they didn't know what they were getting into.
