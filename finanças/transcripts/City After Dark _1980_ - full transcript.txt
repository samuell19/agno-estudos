- Mom. - Aren't we going out? - You told us we're your guests? I'm ready. - Just a minute, Mom. Isn't your set starting at 9? I don't want to be late. Your siblings? I think Albert is playing basketball. What basketball? Call him. How about Ella? She's at Menchu's place, she won't come. We agreed to all go out. Then one can't make it. That's not acceptable. Call them. - There's your dad now, open the gate. - Just a minute. Why aren't you ready yet? - Mommy's overacting. The show is still at 9. - Better to be early than late. Shit! My carpenters are still on the roof. Mr Romy, just resume tomorrow. We'll be done soon. Okay. - Get your daddy's favorite pickles. - All right. Put that there. - Whose glass is this? - Albert's. - Where will Albert sit? - Here. So put this there. - Remember, okay? - Okay. - You said you'll be home at 7, you're late. - Sorry, my client was too talkative. - Hurry up. - I'll follow. Alex! Get out of there! Get your son out of there! Alex! What are you doing there? You were just flirting with the singer! Oh you cunt! Such a lecherous tramp. We'd better go. I don't understand what he wants. After screwing me he wants to clobber me! Once we were at Mass, in the cathedral, he tried to finger me, so I kicked him. Bad timing, you asshole! I was fighting with somebody inside. Fucking bitches. You smell good! They think they can beat me. What idol are you talking about? Oh! Come here. Wanna fight? I'll pop your cherry! If you were a man, I'd cut your balIs off! Give us a kiss, I brought you a present. - The gift first. - Kiss first. - My gift is really first class. - The last one you gave just made me dizzy. I love you Manila! No matter what you are! Young, old, stinky, ugly, girl, boy, gay or lesbian! Let's get high. Don't you ever tire of that? - Can I get a light? - Go on, burn my tits. Know what? I'm going to Saudi. - You're going with Greg Williams? - Of course, he asked me to follow. That sonofabitch Greg Williams! - I'll jump off, don't stop me. I'll kill myself! - That's right, get yourself killed. - Bastard, you don't really love me. - I love you, you always give me dope. Want shotgun this time? - I'll wait for you in church. - You know I still have work. Don't mind that Chinaman! - Careful, he's looking at us. - Never mind him. I can't. He's staring at me again. Hey you! If you tease me again, I'll grab you by the balls. Hey! Watch it! You wanna drown me? Better watch it. Hey man, take it easy, she's my girl. - Your girl's a bumpkin, she's careless. - Okay, man. Baby, I'll foot his bill. - Is that all right with you? - All right. Haven't you learned? Butterfingers! - Why were you flirting? - I wasn't flirting, he was pestering me. You know you're the only one I love. So you won't get mad, here's a kiss. - Come back for me after work. - Sure. You're so beautiful. - When are we getting married? - Soon. "Soon"? I might end up like the girls at work. All unwed mothers. I'm just biding my time, saving money. - See you tomorrow. - Be careful. You gave me only 20 pesos? That's all I earned. You're already at the tourist belt yet you only earn that much? I only work the side streets. I can't cruise the main boulevard. So how much did you earn this week? 120 pesos. Just 120? Mother. - Want some coffee? - No thanks, I'm sleepy. Remember what I tell you. Don't be ashamed in selling sweepstakes tickets, OK? Wait, let me change. Stop crying, baby. Your milk will be ready. Au-au, your bus is here. Give me her lunchbox. You're so hard-headed. I said, clip your hair. It might get into my children's food. - What? - Never mind. I prepared your favorite hotdog. I'll fetch you later at the gate. Don't wander around again. - Do you love having a mommy? - Of course. - Mommy, I'm going. - What's that on your face? - My other classmates use makeup too. - No way. Wash that off. - Good morning, ma'am. - Come in Mr Romy. Finish the work on my roof first. There's still work to do in the backyard. - All damaged by the last typhoon. - Okay. Why's the bathroom all wet! It's like an elephant took a bath. Or were you disco-dancing in here? - How can I shower without wetting the bathroom? - When I shower only this part gets wet. You and your brother, so messy! Let me see your hair. When you're done, dry the rags in the bathroom. Oh my Lord! Everytime I enter your room, I could faint. Should I just close my eyes? I might sit on something smutty! Hey, the two of you? I'm ready. And you? I can't go to school. Why not? I spent all my allowance. What? Again? When will you change your ways? I give up, I give up, I give up! Do you think your dad pulls money out his ass? I'm tired of taking care of all of you. You're the eldest, instead of helping, you only make our lives worse. I ran out of money because of goodwill. My pals always foot the bill. I felt embarrassed so I paid last time. You have to budget your allowance. What if I tell you that we'll do without because I treated my friends - Or that we don't have tuition money because I went shopping? Even if we're not well-off, I'm always ready for your enrollment. Unlike those mothers who always have to borrow for school opening. Not me, I'm always ready. You just don't know I pray every night. Because your lives are in disarray. What will happen if your daddy and I are no longer around? - Now what? - Got to go mom. - Come home right after school. - Yes. I only keep sermonizing because you haven't changed your ways. I keep repeating myself everytime. Okay, I'll get you some money. - Honey c'mon. - It's too early. C'mon. - Isn't it too early for that? Just 5 minutes. What a nuisance... - Let's have some fun, c'mon. - It's too early. Please. - I'm ticklish. - Smells sweet... Let's do this later. - Stop it. - You smell good. Come in. Mommy, I'm off for school. Let me see your face. - Okay, I'll fetch you later at 4:30. - Okay, bye. Will you stop it! Don't you know how your kids spend their money? - C'mon now. - I don't want to. Come in! - There's a lady outside asking for you. - All right. Look at you now, you look like a queen. Perhaps, you don't remember. I'm Miriam from the tenderloin district. I was in church last Wednesday when I saw that whore Minnie. She gave me your address. I came here at once because of a problem. You're the only one who can help me. Can we talk? Let's talk here. No, ah, over here. - Here, I mean over here. - You're still the same Virgie I know. - Have a seat. - Nice living room. Too bad I haven't seen your kids. - I brought you green mangoes. - Thanks. Osang, get my alcohol bottle! You know what? Things only got worse in the tenderloin district. As you know, these sauna girls now compete with us. Even the police charge exorbitant fees for protection. I still only earn 30 pesos per blowjob. But since only 12 goes to me, how will I survive? Minnie told me your husband still has police contacts. He can help. About the green mangoes, sorry no shrimp paste. The fucking whore who promised to bring some forgot all about it. Don't get upset. Why are you still in the life? - That's the way it is. - What do you mean by that? Because you're don't believe in change! But if you tighten your screws, you can make it happen. Look at me. I was determined to change, so I did. Look at yourself, you're still there, no change. Do you get what I said? Maria Cristina! Theresa! It's noon already. Beth wake up! Hurry! Cristina, wake up. - Febrero's outside. - Fuckwit! Plus Ms Vasquez and the entire College of Engineering of La Salle. Hold them off! Vasquez's gown is with Caring, tell her to rush it. - Don't let Febrero in yet. - Yes, yes. - Wake up, what's your name? Hide in the toilet! - But why? Because my hubby's here. Wait, let me check your gown. Caring, Evita needs that tonight. Just a little hemming... My God Caring, don't make me suffer again. I met the minister with pins in my ass! Caring that's for tonight, so rush it. Our Sis Sharon, it's practically turn of the century yet she's still in Consciousness Two. Remember, when my hubby comes in, don't make a sound. - No coughing or sneezing or farting! - Okay. My God, still queer. You know girl, I met this funny man last night. He was fixing the locks of my dresser and then he proceeded to tell a story. "You know Ms Vasquez, I'll do eveything to survive." I answered, "Really?" He said, "I can fix radios, stereos, and TV sets." "And I also know how to arouse." "Arouse!" I screamed. "I can stick a grape on a wire and shove it up your" - I'll put this bluntly - "anus." How deliciously shocking, how horrific! So did you finally try it? Marichu! Let Febrero in now. Febrero, go ahead. Between DeNiro and the Vienna Boys Choir, I'm sure I'll be all in pins tonight. Sis Sharon, I'm entertaining a palace guest! No, thanks. - Cold beer? - Never mind. - I have some chicken if you're hungry. - Later. Good you dropped by. I've been missing you. My child is sick. Your kid's sick or you're womanizing again? - No, he's really sick. - You're not shitting me? Would I lie to you? No. He's really sick. Okay, I'll give up my wallet. I really can't say but I feel antsy. I can't help but doubt what you say. I hear a lot of things about you. That you're crazy over some waitress... a country girl you fetch every night. I dare you to deny it. If not a girl it could be some queen. I know you taxi drivers, always horny. A fag boards your taxi at night, he'll bring you to a dark grassy area. Any moment, the bitch dives down and you see the driver going.... - What is your child sick of? - Measles. 200, that's enough. My kiss? - Where do we go? - Seven Seas Motel, for free lubricant. Okay. - Tomorrow's Saturday. - I know, we'll go to church. - Last Saturday, you failed to show up. - The maid at Gerry's didn't wake me up. A person who neglects his duties with God, et cetera... You sound like my mom, earlier today she nagged me for 3 hours. Mom told me this morning - "If you and Alex plan to marry, start saving. Get a piece of land you can buy in installment." I said, "Where will Alex get the money? He's a folk singer who just lost his job." Wait, my eyes. The water's cold! Move over. Bring me home early. My mom's going crazy looking after us. My brother's been gone for a week. They asked the police to look for him. Shit, I forgot to call Nonong. I already ran out of stuff. Good thing I remembered to call. Don't eat or you'll lose your high. This is Alex. About our deal? What! Man, what a hassle, I told my friends we're loaded. Now what? All right, do something about it next week? Thanks. What? Nothing? None. Wait a minute. - Where did you get this? - I told my mom I ran out of allowance. Won't this tarnish when it's wet? Stupid, of course not. Maybe on the second wash! - What? - Just a minute. - You're leaving me hanging! - Just wait. - Dammit Greg Williams! - What? When you get to Saudi Arabia, will I still hear from you? - Promise you'll bring me there. - Yeah. If you betray me, I'll create a scandal. In just 2-3 months, I'll send for you. And my children, don't forget to send money for them as well. You know their fathers, all good-for-nothings. Yep I won't forget, they're like my own kids now. Sis Bea - hey brother Greg! Can I get advanced payment? I need to buy medicines for my mom. - How much? - 10 pesos only. You always ask for an advance, how much money have I given you? - Please. - Only 10 pesos, why don't you just give her? When I reach Saudi, I'll send you, in dollars. How much is that? How much is left? 77 pesos. Right. Put my wallet back. Come back soon, I have to shower. I still have to clean the house, and my kids are filthy. They stink. - Bid Greg goodbye, he'll leave for Saudi. - Greg, my Avon products, huh? Sure. I'll drown you with Avon products. Thanks, Sis Bea. I'll be back soon. Kids, stay in the alley, don't go too far. - Do you love me? - Yes. - You'll send for me? - Yes. - You know the story of my life? - Yes. - You really love me? - I love you so much. Were you able to buy cold meds? - Let him drink four times a day. - Yes. Sis, you're here. - For you. - What's this? - Things for your house, Ade. - Oh! - This one's for you. - How nice. - You can use this one. - An ice bucket. I brought a lot of food. You brought stew, corned beef, thanks. This is too much. You know my gimmick, always a charity worker. - Sis, I hope you don't tire of us. - I won't. - Febrero, your food is ready. - What? I already ironed your polo shirt. Sis, why don't you eat here with Febrero? No, thanks. I have a customer in the shop. - You'll just pick up some boys. - Of course not! Please close the windows. I stopped bringing strangers home. These days they're all after money. People have become opportunists. In my shop, I fired all my dressmakers. Imagine, they pilfered even the buttons. Next time I hire a dressmaker, I'll require a police clearance. I don't have the time... I have to be early. A patient had hemorrhoid surgery. He's bleeding a lot. I told Dr Vicente it might be worse, maybe cancer of the anus. When will you visit the shop? Day after next, we have a meeting tomorrow - about changing the color of our taxis. - Isn't yellow corny? Why not magenta? - What's magenta? Mrs Viring, when the kids wake up, please feed and bathe them. Buboy pulled a tantrum the other night maybe because of the heat. - I'll take care of it. - Mrs Viring's so negligent. How about you Febrero, what time will you leave? I'll shower while I wait for Mrs Nita. Let me drop you off, I brought my car. Okay. Know what? I love Febrero so much. Look at how I take care of him. I even take care of his children from another woman as if they were my own. I noticed that. Because when I first came to Manila, he was the only person who helped me. I was still so afraid and naive. Then I met him and felt at ease. - Life in Manila is tough, right? - Girl, you're stating the obvious! - Thanks, sis. - Okay. You will earn more if you let me introduce you to some Japanese. You'll earn up to 700 pesos, easy. Instead of being tired yet earning almost nothing. That guy was trying to pimp me to Japanese men. - Now what? - Stop bugging my girlfriend. Mind your own business! Don't stop them! Let them finish! - How much? - Same as before. - How many? - Two for each of us. Okay, wait for me at the corner. What the fuck! Motherfucking assholes! Ooh what yummy-looking guys! Whose is this? Pay 240. Don't you sing anymore in the club? Not anymore after the shooting incident. My mom got pissed and asked me to stop. My God! Counting this will take me forever. Okay guys, drop me off at the next block. If you want a sex trip, I recommend an attendant at Sauna Turko. - Near Bayside Club. - I like that. - Man, she's blind. - Blind? That's some trip. Your eldest son's still not home. Don't be too strict with the kids, especially with Alex. He's a man. He can take care of himself. He's driving me crazy. - Enough of that. - Better than turning hysterical. - I hope you don't mind if I ask. - Show your armpits. You men are alike. You all ask the same question. Better this than asking for alms. I'm just curious about your blindness. Do you want a blowjob or an interview? - You don’t find it awkward? - Why should I? Others pretend to be clean but deep inside, they stink. I may be blind but at least, I earn a lot. That why I'm admired. - Where's your sexy spot? - My nipples. But I won't be here for long. A fortune-teller said that I'll get my vision back. Also I'll be off to Saudi to be with my boyfriend. Turn over. - I just need sedatives. - You'll have to pay 40 each. - Make it 20. - I can't. The police! - Where have you been? It's late. - From Mrs Poleng's place, for mahjong. Bring me home early. My mom might freak out again. She got mad when she learned my brother found a job. He'll be on the night shift. She said, "What night shift?!" "Work should be during the day because the night's for sleeping." - Tell your mom, we've gone to the moon. - She also lectured me. She asked me to shift to Nutrition. She says she doesn't know what I'll do with my Tourism degree. I said if I have to shift, I'll take up Hotel and Restaurant Management. She was so shocked she was speechless. - Wait, I'll go to the john. - Okay. Sis, go! I'll see you later, okay? But I'm with my girlfriend. I can bring her home and see you later at 2 a.m. Do you love me? I love you very much. But you don't respect me. You're wrong, because you're the only girl I respect. If not, then why would I kiss you? - Your tongue is digging too deep. - That's what makes it delectable. Will you marry me? Yes, I'll marry you. What kind of a man do you think I am? Hey, horny pervs! You better get lost, this is private property! Didn't you hear? If you don't leave, we'll haul your asses to court! Stop fouling up this place! This is private property! It's okay. Well, it's just a trip. - But you don't love me. - Of course, I love you. - So this is what it's like. - It's okay, right? First I thought it would be tough. But I find it's okay. I hope we last a long time. I've had enough of flings. I'm tired of those. If you play around, I'll kill myself. But I have a girlfriend? No problem, but if you go with other gays, I'll burn your house down. You know me, I'm neurotic and tense. What I hate most are those who fool others. There's a lot of evil already in the world, let's not add more. I just go along with the tide. Your trip is my trip. In fact my friends are all weird. One's a lesbian, another one's blind - a sauna masseuse. By the way, maybe you can help my blind friend? I'm looking for a masseuse, she's blind, her name is Bea. Oh fuck! Too horny, that's why. - What happened there? - Nothing, just a heart attack. This place makes me tense. Do you have coins? Coins? What do you think I am, a piggy bank? Do you have a small peso? I guess so. - If you want a smoke, have some. - How many do you need? Just one. How do you find the sounds? Too loud. You have your own style! - Are you waiting for Bea? - Yes. - Do you want a massage? - Goodness, no! Why will I ask for a female attendant? Lightning might hit us. I can't help but think about your kind. Don't get offended, but don't you...? - Don't you...find men hard? - Idiot, that's what makes it delightful. - Do you believe in true love? - What? In a way, yes. Bea's my true love. But are you her true love? I don't know. So how now? I don't really know. - I've been peeping at her since we were kids. - You're such a horndog, you tomcat! So what's the problem? I don't know. Bea's not a money-grubber. She's probably not into bull dykes. I keep giving her my all but I still don't know what she wants. How bout you? - Me? What else, I'm a fairy. - I know, I mean who's your true love? Many. Your one true love? I have a student, I also have... What is this, True Confessions? I can't take it! Anyway, I have a student. He's okay, sweet too. And are you his true love? Will you stop talking about true love, sis, that's already passe! God, I can't take this. All that's just an illusion. They say that with true love, life becomes more beautiful. But everytime I fall in love, My life gets screwed up. Careful. I'll go crazy. Why? I don't know. - How long have you been blind? - Since I was a child. - How did it happen? - I was almost 3 when I lost my sight. I was still living near the US base. You don't realize how lucky you are, really you're so lucky. I see everything including things that I should not see. Even things that don't exist, I can still see them. That might just be your imagination. Actually, I meant - everybody in this world is crazy. The faces that we see aren't their real selves. People show different faces - for families, friends, spouse, girlfriend, gay lover, etc. Right? They keep changing, layer upon layer. Like me, when my boyfriend tells me "I love you" - what kind of face is that? One that's out to filch more money. So why pity yourself? People may be crazy but the world never stops turning. - In the end, we reap what we sow. - Bull. Queen of Martyrs, Part Two. I only decided to see what I want. For those I can't, never mind. See? What can you see, you're blind! My God! Anyway, I have a friend who's a nurse. I'll introduce you to her. I'm sure she can help you. She would know some specialists. All right. - Just fetch me then. - Okay. - Careful, there's a canal. - I know. Hey did you know, in the 18th century, you were a famous coquette! There was a painter who was madly in love with you. He stole for you, they cut off his hands, and that's why you're blind now. You have very strong psychic powers that you must develop. So keep praying. I'm sorry, you're paying for so much. That's why you haven't seen your father... And you? A fag! Don't mind her. That's the latest fad, crazy people here in Manila. Careful, there's a sidewalk. - What's going on? - There's a film shoot. Just put some masking tape! - Who are the actors? - Al Tantay and Marissa... Let's go. We might not catch Adelina. - How about you, where are you going? - We're leaving! Move aside, move. Good evening, Miss. Maybe you can help me, I'm looking for Adelina Macapinlac. - Who's she? - She's a nurse here. There's no such name here. I bring her here every night. Her shift is from 6 to 12. I know all the nurses here and there's no Adelina Macapinlac. You must be making a mistake. Kindly check please. - I told you, there's none. - Kindly look in your logbook. - I personally bring her here. - I told you, there's none, look. Do you know an Adelina Macapinlac? I told you there's no Adelina Macapinlac here. We know all the nurses here, but we haven't heard of her. If not in the evening shift, maybe she transferred to the morning? None. I know all the shifts here. Didn't I tell you, she doesn't work here. I need her now because my friend who is blind needs a specialist... I told you there's no such nurse here named Adelina... See there: Mesa, Milan, nothing. You're such a pest! Stop calling me a pest! If you don't want then get somebody else to help me. [Speaks in regional language.] What else do you want from me, bastard! What else do you want me to do?! What haven't I done for you? How dare you complain! My body's already bruised because of work. When I get here, you treat me like shit! - Leave and I'll smash your face! - C'mon! I came here to survive! I would have starved to death in the province! - Ingrate! - I took any kind of work just to survive! - I endured everything for money. - You have no fucking gratitude! - I don't need you! - So now you no longer need me?! That's why you shack up with everyone, you slut! - Son of a bitch! - Don't come near! - Radiant light... - Cleanse our body. - Radiant light. - Peaceful heart. She's fooling you, fooling us. Look how she behaves. That hypocrite. All sweetness and light - when she starts going: "You know sis, I love Febrero very much," but then - I'll run her over next time I see her! This Marichu, she's out of control. If Febrero's not around, she goes - "He doesn't love me anymore... He's just using me." Lovely legs! But once he's there, she's head over heels again. Tell me, do you know any queer who's not neurotic? I'm not pretending I'm perfect. But I hate those who fool others. The minute you catch her lying, forget her. What does she take you for? What kind of woman is your mistress? Where the hell did you pick up that little demon whore? Radiant light... Fill us with profound warmth. - Radiant light... Maybe the receptionist made a mistake? The hell she did. Febrero, there's no Adelina Macapinlac in that fucking hospital. I already quarreled with those bitch nurses. Dug into their official files, nothing. These days, you can't trust anybody anymore. - Where have you been? - From the hospital, where else? Why? Febrero, what's wrong? What's the matter? Why? Febrero, I love you. Whatever happens, don't leave me. Such a pity. When I gave birth to Alex... I couldn't believe it. I hate you! I hate the world! - She's been like that. - I hate all of you! - What's wrong? - What's wrong, what's wrong... She says people keep duping her. Her gay friend brought her to a hospital for her eyes. But the nurse didn't work there. A fake! Enough of your drama, c'mon. Let's go, Gaying. Anyway, I'm going to Saudi. Remember when we were still near the base? - You used to stink then because you didn't bathe. - You stank more. Here, drink this. I remember how you used to sell sweepstakes tickets using English. And you were selling fake imports. But you were really pimping those girls who turned you down. Bastard. You were my idol. - You were busted that's why you're here. - Hey I was never busted. I'm here because I followed you. Followed me? You were busted. That's enough, this isn't Coke. - I think you're stoned. - Yeah. Why don't you rest here, c'mon. - What is this? - A pushcart, let's rest here. This place is so stinky. We're in a garbage dump. Get used to the smell. - Anyway you used to smell that way. - Of course not. Kano, I don't like that. - Why do you insist on that? - That's where the rhapsody is. Febrero, we have to talk. It's important. - I'm pregnant. - What? Aren't you careful? Haven't you been taking your pills? No. You're so stupid! You didn't take your pills! What now? We should get married. What a bummer! How can you be so dumb? What will I feed you? You have to understand! We talked about this! I'm a man! I won't marry you just to neglect you! What I want is for us to wait so we can save up. What an idiot! Because I love you so much. You bastard! I'll kill you! Daddy, let me! Don't stop me! I'll kill you! You're such a pain! Let me take at him! Let me handle this! Where are you going? Trying to escape? You motherfucker! I told you never to do drugs! Nothing but foolishness! Move. Now what? I told you so many times not to do drugs! Bastard! Poor baby, always kept waiting. I've been wanting to tell you... You might feel hurt but - you've been waiting for nothing. Your taxi driver is married. Get out, I don't need you here! You bitch, get out! You good-for-nothing! Here are your clothes! Take that! You two-timer! Don't come back here! See what happens when a woman doesn't play smart. Stay in the rain! That's what you deserve, you harlot! I'm done with you! Bitch! How dare you beat my children? You slut! You think you're a big shot? - You bitch, flirt, tramp! - You're the bigger whore! Our recruiter swindled us in Bangkok! We got into trouble looking for him. He even took our 3,000-peso bond! I became a waiter just to survive! If I didn't do that, I could have starved! I even borrowed money just to fly back! Son of a bitch! - Sis Bea, I'm back. - Where have you been? Didn't I ask permission to buy medicine for my mother? Where was the store, out of town? I've been waiting for you. I already quarreled with the neighbor. And the house is so filthy! Go clean the house. - Brother Greg, where are my Avon products? - None! Okay, none. When it comes to money you show up. but when I need you, you disappear. What a fucking life! Back to zero again! Greg, what kind of person are you? Every day to Mother Mary we pray... You see, Alex left the house. We scolded him but that was nothing. I asked his friends but they don't know where he is. So I came here to ask if you know. - It's been a long time since - - I know teenagers could be sensitive. Just a few reprimands, then you're gone just like that. I guess it happens in the your family too. That's just natural. Come in. I've also been at odds with Alex. He doesn't show up. They say he lives with a queen. - A queen? - Yes, a queer guy. Ma'am, come join the rosary. By the way, this is my husband. She's Alex's mother, Van's boyfriend. She'll be our in-law. These are our other children. - Good evening. - Come in. - Guess I'm lucky. - Why? - I also have a devotion to Fatima. - Come in. Hail Mary, full of grace... The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. So let me tell you how I met Dr Lagdameo... Vaginal herpes, according to Time magazine. Until he reached my mound of happiness. Ma'am, he'll be here soon. Sis Sharon, my gown! My show's at 10:30 and I still look like a floozy. Hey, wake up. Your mom's waiting outside! Wake up, your mom is here. She might create a scandal. I'm still sleepy. Get up, quick. How dare you make my house a pigsty, it smells terrible. That guy, what a sex maniac. I was tied to the 4 posts of the hospital bed. Then he wanted to penetrate me with that protoscope of his! What did you do? I was so disgusted with myself. Ma'am, your son. Fetched by mother. My friends. Thank you all. We have to go. You know how kids are now, they're very sensitive. Give her an award! I need a cigarette, I'll go insane. I must apologize to all of you. It doesn't happen everyday that my mother-in-law visits. Why won't I go crazy? She looks decent, like a teacher. But she's a former prostie, girls. You know the boyfriend of Alex's mother used to have connections with the police. The result of their affair was Alex. And before you know it, one child followed another, instant family. My mother-in-law, no more a prostie, mother! Alex. Alex, don't do that again, okay? Miss, I'm pregnant. Don't get mad at me. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to ask help from you but there's nobody else I can turn to. I'm heartbroken. Don't leave me. I have to take care of my siblings, my mother... Who are you? About Febrero. Come with me. - Get an abortion. - We don't have money. Febrero has neither. He told me he'll marry me. - You're new here, right? - Yes. Why did you get pregnant? You should have been careful. I love Febrero very much. All men will say the same thing. - How could he do this, I loved him. - Why do we all fool ourselves, who knows? Please help me. How? Talk to Febrero. Listen. How will Febrero marry you? He's already married with two kids. You think I'm his wife? No, I'm his mistress. If I give him to you, then what about me? Besides, whether he's mine or yours, these men will always have others. You're still a country girl in a big city. Innocent, like I was then. When I first came to Manila, I was also always the victim. That Febrero even has a gay sponsor. Next time, be careful before falling. You have to outsmart these men. Otherwise, these assholes will just crush you. And don't cry over men, that's passe. Be strong and get an abortion. Know what... I see Manila like it's a cloud floating. Then it changes form, color. At times, it looks messed up. Rough. Other times, it looks cool, okay. Sometimes, it can be annoying, hurtful. Just ride on, it's a trip. Know what man, Manila is more beautiful than the US base district. Here in Manila, everything explodes. Great! It keeps whirling around, that's why you just need to go with the flow... If not you'll explode with it. You have to be quick, just go for the ride. Who's game today? C'mon. Now what? - Do you want to join the trip? - Yeah, me too. Hey get out of there! How long have you been pregnant? Three months. You can still terminate it. I don't have money. Not you. Your boyfriend. I don't see him anymore. He's with someone else. Oh my! These kids are so frisky! Get out of there! - Bring out our bags. - Here. - Hurry up so we don't get stuck in traffic. - You didn't tell me earlier to pack up. What else do we need? - Were you able to find a job? - Yes. Outside the city, 13 pesos a day. But it's too far, transportation going there is already 2.50. Another 2.50 for the return trip, plus food... It's not worth it. Your daugther has a problem. Mrs Cora, we have to go. - Where are you going? - We're returning to our hometown. - Why are you going back there? - There's nothing here for us. Okay. We'll go now. That bastard Rudy, promised us Japanese. But they were just local hicks! You're right. Bald and old. They could only pay half of 700 pesos. - Hey? - Misses, I can't. I'm waiting for somebody. But we're the only passengers here. - We'll pay for you. - I told you I'm waiting for somebody. Damn prick! Call a cab for me please. When you live in Manila, you must be street-smart. I had no luck in Saudi, so I looked for a new job. - At least we're together. - What kind of job? Besides, we'll earn more here than what you earn at the sauna. 200 bucks a night, easy money. No sweat. - And we could work together. - What kind of job is it? Someone's arranging it. It'll be soon. Just wait here. Don't wait for your taxi driver. He's not coming back. Now that you're pregnant. That's how these dickheads are. Just come with me to meet some Japanese. Hey Mila, don't forget! We'll have to get our cunts inspected tomorrow! I can't pee dammit, my bladder's bursting! Sonny you prick, you didn't say a lot of Japanese have arrived. You bitch! I dare you to say anything to my husband. I'll break your bones. You want people to find you covered in newspapers! So you're a hooker after all! Van, I have a problem. I need a favor. Can you lend me that necklace I gave you. I just need some dough right now. What will you do with it? I'll have it pawned for a week then get it back. Pawn it to buy drugs? No, I won't buy drugs. - I just need it. Got a little problem. - No. - Please. - No. - Why will you get it back from me? - I need it badly. No, you gave it to me. Why are you so stubborn? I'll return it. Just for a week. The trouble with you is you get addicted. Then you run to queers. Now you need money. - I'll borrow it for just a week. - One week, you don't even show up. Ronnie, drive these carolers away! Dammit. - What? - What I'm asking. - No way. Go away! Hey buddy! - I just need it. - What's wrong with you? You give then take it back? - Anyway it's mine. - Hey, don't pull it! - I told you I need it! - I told you, you can't. - Give it to me! - Hey! - See! - Give it to me! It's mine. You shit! Hey, what is this? - Let go of my daughter! - Well fuck you both! - Mommy, he's getting my necklace. - This is mine, I'm taking it back! Stop that! Get out of here! That's enough, Vangie! You, get out! Come, let's go inside. Don't ever show your face here again! - Screw you! - Back at you! Cristina, anyone you fancy among Alex's friends? - Those? - They've been eyeing you for some time now. They used to be fresh from college. But look at them now, all drug addicts. - Don't you like that, experienced? - Experienced with syringes you mean! You're such a smarty-pants! - Sis just 200, I'll pay you later. - Will you lay off me! Sis please, just 200 pesos. I need it very badly. Let's talk here. Listen to me. I'll go crazy. Everytime I see you, you're the worst possible condition! No sleep! No money! Drunk! Stoned! Problematic! What kind of life is that?! Come back, I'm not done. You cannot spend your life from one drugstore to another. You're always in debt, borrowing money! When will that fucking stupid cycle end? Hey Alex! Look at yourself, you're still young! Good-looking and smart. So why are you wasting your life on drugs? It's idiotic and stupid, that's the whole point! You know what happened to you Alex?... What's your value in life? Nothing. Have you seen yourself lately? You're an addict, a wreck! No matter what I say you never listen to anything! I'm sorry for you. I mean, you're young. You should be in school. You can plan your career, your future et cetera but nothing! You're stupid! You've become a wreck! Because of drugs! You're wasting your life! Consciously, you're ruining your life because of drugs! Don't you have another pair of slippers? Change those, they're noisy. Yes, ma'am. Guess what happened in the courtroom the other day? I had a client, and he's gay. Can you imagine he looked at the judge and said... "Sister!" He swished this way and that. Then he did this and flicked his eyebrow. - Then he went like this. - Au-au, don't eat with your fingers. Judge Feliciano said - Then he said, "But girl, I'd rather face my audience." The judge got mad. He got the gavel and banged it and banged it - Didn't I tell you not to eat with your fingers! Won't you ever learn?! - What is this place? - We're going to work. - A job? - Yeah. - What job? - Easy money. - Wait a minute. - Come on. - Wait! - Come on. Come on. - Pretty girls in live sex shows! - Let go of me! No! You'll turn me into a whore! Asshole! Let go of me! - Stop it! - I'll kill you first. You animal! I don't want to go! Don't touch me! Still wanna fight? You skank! - Now what? Are you coming? - Motherfucker! Bitch, how dare you give me a hard time. Febrero, what happened? I've been looking for you. Look at my condition now! - Come with me to church. - Get off me! Son of a bitch! I hope you die, you savage! Coward, coward! Your wife's a whore, a call girl! She's famous among the Japanese! Me, I've always been a decent woman. You animal, son of a bitch! Mr, Mr - where's the body of our dead? What's the name? Over there. There she is. Sis, what's going on? - Mr, that's not our dead. - What do you mean? - Just what I said. - What did you say? He's driving me crazy. I told you that isn't Adelina Macapinlac. You fag whores, you said Adelina Macapinlac, that's her. We're indeed fags but we're not whores! - And that's not Adelina Macapinlac! - That is Adelina Macapinlac! - I told you it's not Adelina Macapinlac! - Stop shouting! That's...not...Adelina Macapinlac. If it's Adelina Macapinlac, what will I do to you? Oh my, I'll really go insane! What a lousy job this is! These gays are impossible! It's her, so why do they insist. Sis, take it easy. Cool down. Didn't I tell you? Porky's here again. I'm sorry, Mrs. Miss, there was a mistake. They had almost the same name but their clothes were switched. That one is Avelina Macasaet. We sent Adelina Macapinlac to the province. But we can send a telegram tomorrow so they can return her. Sis, help me with this! Not there, that's for corpses. This is too much. Enough. I've had enough. Get away from me! You'll borrow money? Again? How much do you think I earn here? What a racket! You do this all the time! You come here just to borrow money! Bea, hide me. - The police are after me! Hide me! - What? Dammit will you leave me alone! I'll have them arrest you! Why you whore. - What's going on? - I think it's the cops. Miss, have you seen a dyke around here? - She went to the roof, go right then straight ahead. - That way! At the back! Quick! Let me go! - You bastard, you just wanna screw me! - Stop playing hard to get. Let go of me! You sons of bitches! No! Alex is now in a drug rehab center. He's destined to become a respectable citizen. Kano the drug pusher will rot in jail. Baby fortunately married a doctor who understood her predicament. Virgie became a social worker, attending to women who went astray, like she did. Bea felt disgusted by the filth in her profession and turned her back on it. She's now a waitress in a deaf and blind restaurant in Manila. Sis Sharon, after joining a religious revival, acquired a wholesome mentality. He also learned to reject same-sex desires. Van maintained her good standing as a student. She's now an agent bent on reforming those who bring darkness to Manila. - Sir. - Yes? - May I ask for some water, I'll just wash my face. - Sure, son. Thanks. Okay.
