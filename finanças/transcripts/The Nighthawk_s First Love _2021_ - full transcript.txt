When did you first notice people looking at you? It was in fourth grade. We were studying Lake Biwa in social studies. It's Japan's biggest lake and holds the most water. Who's visited Lake Biwa? Wow, so many of you. How was it? - I wanted to swim. - That's right. You can swim there. - Lake Biwa. - Did your mom swim? - She's afraid of freckles. - Oh, I see. Lake Biwa! Aiko's got Lake Biwa on her face. It sure looks like it. - It matches. - It does. Whoa! Can you believe it? - A total match. - It's a miracle. Lake Biwa! That's just horrible. Well, we were kids. Besides, the teacher told them off and they apologized. I know it's congenital, but did you ever try to remove it? Right. When I was little, they tried all sorts of remedies. Like pressing dry ice on my face. But every time I showed pain, my mother would get this sad look. And it didn't help. So we stopped trying. Did giving up those treatments change how you felt about your condition? Stopping treatment meant... I didn't have to see her worry. Here. Thanks. Marie... You're a power woman. Oh, stop that. We're ready for you. Do the shoot now, okay? You can decide later. Let's go. - Go for it! Don't be nervous. - I'm not nervous. So you're not interested? No, I'm not. I totally agree it's not a good fit. But must you turn down every adaptation that comes your way? I know. Let me know by next week if you change your mind. Sure. - I parked there. - Okay, see you. Hold still. Sorry! Professor? Oh, good morning. Good morning. I'll carry some. Great. Take this, then. - This, too. - Thanks. What's inside? A microwave generator. I found it secondhand. Ours is getting old. With the cuts to my research budget, we have to settle for used. By the way, I read your book. It's a powerful story. Thank you. You wanted to be an astronaut? I was surprised. [Lessons From My Face] Amazing... it's a great book. Is it a best-seller? I saw stacks of them. Don't ask me. Why not? It's your book, Aiko. It's not just my story. It's about many people. But the cover... Do you like that picture? My mother complained about it. Huh? Let's see... I think it's superb. How's the experiment coming? Just fine, I think. Very good, then. Hey, Harada! Yeah? Be careful with that antenna. It's not cheap. Sorry, I've got it. Harada, you like this cover too, I bet. - Huh? - This one. Well, it's very Ms. Maeda, I guess. What kind of reaction is that? I don't like the color of the spine. I was trying for a softer look. It's too soft, now... Does it hurt? No. It doesn't. Here you are. I told you to be a good girl and wait. I'm so sorry. Sorry, my meeting just finished. It's making waves. You're still declining all interview requests? I don't like harping on about stuff. Got it. Now... There's one request to do a film adaptation. What? They wanna make a fiction film. I just need your opinion. My opinion? It's a bad idea. Isn't it a chance to increase public awareness of Ota's Nevus? People might recognize their prejudice. Sorry. I thought you'd be more excited. But, hey... How about meeting the director at least? I can tell he's genuinely interested. You've been talking with him? Nothing serious. It wouldn't hurt to have one dinner. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Excuse us. Come on. Fine, then. I'll meet him and turn it down myself. Eww! That's so gross! Gross! Ms. Maeda, you're a Master's student in engineering, right? - I am. - What's your research? Computational electromagnetics, mainly. We test whether electromagnetic waves conform to theoretical models. She's always like this. Over my head. It was me. I started a topic that's beyond me. Science isn't my thing. I feel you. Sorry, I'm late. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Marie Hodaka, Misawa Press. Thank you. I'm out of cards. That's totally fine. You have a card, Tobisaka? That's new. A director doesn't need one. Thanks. I'm Aiko Maeda. Tobisaka. I just can't believe we're actually meeting. And I love that cover photo. Actually, I just happened to be at the shoot that day. - You were there? - Yeah. I couldn't get you out of my head. A strong, yet shy face, showing mixed emotions... A bold stance, despite it all. I could feel that woman's struggle. I was blown away when I saw that image on a book cover later. The story was so compelling. I've been hooked since then. Are you okay? Aiko? You okay? - I'm sorry. - Don't be. Excuse me. Let me check on her. I'll go. Ms. Maeda. I'm sorry. I was going on and on. No, it's not your fault. Excuse me. You must be suspicious about my motives. Look, your book... Your book reminded me... of childhood feelings I'd forgotten. As kids, we threw ourselves at things and ended up bruised all over. Cuz we took things seriously. Seeing your clear eyes... I can tell that you throw your whole being into life. That's why your photo spoke to me. Thank you. It might sound rude to say this, but I haven't seen even one of your movies. It's not rude at all. Can I get your contact? I'll send a link to my films. Sure. Lemme scan yours. Thanks. There, I just sent it. I got it. Thank you. I'll watch them. Please do. I should go. Get some rest. [From Tobisaka: "Dreams, Illusions, Fantasies, Shadows"] [Dreams, Illusions, Fantasies, Shadows] Aiko! Thanks for coming. Miu, you're a different person! Join our club. We need women. Not for me. But, it looks fun. I know, right? Forget the lab. Let's party! Harada, what do you think? Huh? Well, you look sexy. Good. You'll join, too. I don't think so. C'mon guys, don't let me down. Life is short. Dance like crazy. Convert that static energy into kinetic energy! Harada, c'mon. Marie? Can you talk now? I wanted to ask... Will you be talking to Tobisaka about the movie? We don't have any meetings planned. He's shooting another film now. Okay, I see. Why ask? You wanna greenlight the movie? No, I don't. I watched one of his movies. And I want to share my reaction. Really? Why don't you just text him? I'm sure he'd like that. Okay. [As a kid, I cherished acorns and stones. Your movie reminded me of forgotten...] [Good luck with the shoot. Hope it goes well.] [Sent: Good luck with the shoot. Hope it goes well.] What do you wanna drink? Anything. The saké selection is good here. You like saké, right? How... It was in the book. Oh, that's right. - It's true? - Yes. How about Dassai? - You want it cold? - Cold. - Cold, it is. - Good. You're shooting a film now? Yeah, we finished early today. The timing was perfect, and I thought maybe... Perfect for me, too. I wanted to share my reaction to your movie. I see. How was it? Good... very good. Really? You know... People avoid seeing some things. They close their eyes to them and let them pass. But you're different. You pick them up and polish them. And you know how to share them, too. I could tell just by watching. Sorry, I sound like some critic. Not at all. It means a lot to me. And that actress was fascinating. - You mean Miwa Shirosaki? - Yes. She was a regular in my early work. Is that so? I could feel your trust. Oh, you think so? Yes. Also... That last scene where she leaves in tears... Thank you for treating me. I haven't drunk this much in ages. Really? When's your last train? Let's see... How about you? I'm off tomorrow, so I'll pull an all-nighter to work on my screenplay. Finally... I feel ready to write it. - An all-nighter? - Yep. Oh! My train leaves in seven minutes. No kidding? Sorry. Can you run? Yes, I can. Good. We'll sprint. - You okay? - Yes. I'll make it... I'll be fine. Thank you. Today... Today was really fun. Yeah. For me, too. Well, then. Wait, Ms. Maeda. Here. What's this? I've been waiting to give you this. What? Open it later. Okay. Bye. What? That's pretty eye shadow. I know. And did you notice? I extended my eyelids. A little work. I disgust you? No, you don't. It's like makeup. But why the sudden interest? Actually, I'm going to a play with the director I told you about. What? For real? That's a date! It's not like that. Oh, my gosh. Why are you panicking? But... Let's get some clothes. What? Why not? Do it for me. Well, if you insist... Where's good? I'd always known about you. He's the one who broke things off. Our bliss together was brief. We both witnessed him losing his honesty and kindness. He totally changed. Most of our time together was torture. Even when we were happy, I could never forget your existence. I always wondered... how his wife could pass the time knowing he'd betray her. They all expected me to pretend I was someone else. The only thing real was suffering. But... Now I'm talking to you, I feel like my true self. I've never been so honest. Thanks for waiting. - It was really great. - Yeah. I'm glad I invited you. She is very different than in your movie. An actress has many faces. I'll tell her. She'll love it. Do you still see her? Tobisaka. You came to see me. I could've comped you. Pleased to meet you. Well... it was amazing. Thank you very much. Is she the new project? Can we talk? The treatment's good, but I need a script. And when's the shoot? It's still too early. Who's the director? - Someone younger. - For real? Sorry, let's talk later. Aiko! I never agreed. Yeah, I know. She and I go way back. I just floated the idea with her. So this is all for your project? Even today? If I say no, then I've just wasted your time. Let's go somewhere and talk. No, I'm sorry. We're done. No, I mean... Are you texting me? I'm sorry I ran off. Sorry I jumped the gun. I do like your movies. Still... I'm disappointed I always operate this way. I know you won't turn me into a pity story... or add some tear-jerking ending. But I need time to process. Right. Of course. I won't give up. Let me finish my script. And if it doesn't feel right, we'll stop. Deal. Good. What a relief. Usually... I sit on someone's left side. But today, I sat on your right side. I knew I could trust you with my left side. I'm glad you did. I guess... I have feelings for you. Any update on that date? He's out of town for a shoot, so we can't meet. But we text every day. Really? It must be cool to date a director. You look happy! We're still working things out. Okay. But you're texting every day. It's weird to behave like this. Go on, girl. Lose that self-control. I don't want that. You don't? I think it's amazing. Right, Harada? Huh? Hey, leave him out of this. Sorry, Harada. As long as you're happy, I think it's fine. And how've you been doing? Are you happy, too? - Happy about? - You know. - It's been ages. - Long time no see. You really came. I did. You know what? I watched all your movies. You did? Yep. All of them, including the shorts. That's crazy. How were they? I'll tell you later. Jeez. Now, I'm nervous again. How about dinner at my place? - Sure. - Good. Let's hit that grocery store. You've been fine? Yep. And you? Come in. Thank you. I gotta make a call. Make yourself at home. Okay. Hello, it's Tobisaka. Thanks for calling. Yes. Oh, okay. I'm working on the rewrite. I guess a couple more days. [The Complete Works of Kenji Miyazawa] Can you help me out? Sure. What? Once more. My birthmark... Remember I wrote about those boys calling me Lake Biwa? Yeah. Lake Biwa! Aiko's got Lake Biwa on her face. It sure looks like it. - It's totally Lake Biwa. - Seriously identical. That moment, everybody was so curious about me. I felt embarrassed. But there was some delight, too. Then... Stop that! That's a horrible thing to say. Sorry about that. Our teacher was always so kind. The class was shocked into silence. But, I was the most shocked. "A horrible thing." My face was a horrible thing. From the next day, everybody became so careful. They tiptoed around me. I guess it's only natural. If the teacher hadn't said that, things might have been different. Childhood traumas are intense. When I hear "Lake Biwa", I still feel the shock. Tobisaka... Will you get busy again? Yeah, just for a while. I have some commercials to shoot. I see. But I'll take a day off on your birthday. What? It's coming soon. Right, from the book. Where do you wanna go? Take the scenery, not me. You look funny. No, I don't. How often can I see you rowing a boat? For my memory. - Nice. - Give it here. I wanna take yours. No, thanks. Come on. Now. Look at me. That's good. With the mountain. Say cheese. Maybe this angle? How about this one? No, I look creepy. Not at all. It's a nice picture. Do you like Kenji Miyazawa? Huh? You have his books. Yeah, he's cool. We're both from Iwate. Kenji anticipated... the quantum-theoretical model of understanding the universe. "That phenomenon called 'I' is..." "one blue illumination of a theoretical, organic alternating current lamp." That's Spring & Asura? What about you? What's your favorite? "The Nighthawk Star", I guess. It's a strange story, isn't it? We read it in school, but I didn't get it. The Hawk tries to force the Nighthawk to change his name. The Hawk can't stand the similarity in their names and calls him "Ichizo". My classmates laughed at such a funny name. But why did the Nighthawk choose death over giving up his name? He couldn't abandon the name God gave him. Deprived of his name, he'd be deprived of his existence. [Explore Lake Biwa] Good morning. I'm glad I shared my Lake Biwa story. Please make the movie. Reading the screenplay, watching your movies, and talking... all helped me decide. You sure? Yay! My approval doesn't matter? Of course, it does. Am I gonna regret this? Okay. I humbly receive your permission, Miss Essayist. You better. Yes, thank you. Thank you. I don't think we should change the flow. Right, yes. Okay. No, wait. If we mess with that part, it's gonna mean a total rewrite. I'm cutting a lot in my next draft, so we need that part. It'd confuse the audience. That's right. Are you sure? Exactly. I thought I fixed that part already. Wait, are you looking at the right version? Draft Five, right? That's it. You're missing the newest. I'll send it right away. Okay, bye. Sorry about that. It'll get sticky. Sorry. They're pushing me to fix it. This looks great. You're a good cook. How about some saké? I found the saké shop. Really? Close to here? Pour me a little. Look down a bit. Her story was totally different from what I expected. Miwa's the best. See? She's best for the role. How are you expanding the story for the screen? I've shifted focus away from the birthmark. It's just one part of her uniqueness. Any thoughts as you start production? Thanks. I'll email you later. Well done. You, too. Did you read the rewrite? Yeah. Can I meet her in person? Imitating her won't help. Still, we need something real... But you're the one playing her. Am I the right choice? I chose you, Miwa. You've changed. You think? - I'm talking about your writing. - Oh... It's gonna be beautiful. So you choose me over others? That's the diva I know. I'll make it a success. [My Face] We're starting the run-through. Welcome! Oh, hello. Thank you for coming all the way. - Good to see you. This way... - Yes, thank you. How was the traffic? We came by train. - We should've met you. - No need. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. Things are busy. I'll introduce you to everyone later. Please don't worry. I really must. So just wait. Please sit down. Oh, thank you. Make yourselves comfortable. A lot's happening, so you may have to wait a while. Please just relax and enjoy. I doubt it's your first time on a set... A first for me. - What? Is it? - Yes. Really? But adaptations are all the rage now. Since you're in publishing, I figured it would be old hat. It's my first time. I'm here thanks to Aiko. Thank you again. - I appreciate it. - Have fun. Oops! Excuse me. - I'm sorry. - You okay? Sorry. I'm fine. Come to think of it... Aiko? - Don't worry. It's all right. - Sorry... Hey there, stranger. Hi. Sorry I suddenly showed up. A treat for everybody. I hope there's enough. Thanks. Excuse me. Here. Thank you. I'm getting sleepy. You wanted to come... Hello. It's easy to get tired on set. Everyone's so busy. Right, I don't wanna get in the way. I finally met you in person. Your... Your makeup is incredible. It looks real. I went around with it on, just for practice. It made me more aware of how people see you and of all the cosmetics ads. I began to see things I'd never noticed before. For me, those things all came slowly. But when I washed my face at night, all those feelings would disappear. That felt confusing. If I could wash my nevus off, just like makeup, would I forget my feelings, too? You two... Were you and Tobisaka an item? What? I'm just guessing. We have a weird relationship. We've been dating and breaking up since we were teenagers. My family had all sorts of problems, so my teen years were rocky. During that time, he was the world to me. But every time a film project began, he'd ignore me. So I snapped. That's when he told me he sees me through his movies. What? Cinema is the love of his life. Rather than being real lovers, we're better off making movies as a director and actor. Are you and Tobisaka...? Aiko! Yes? - You're up! - Okay. It's true. I'm seeing him. Sorry, I held things up. The Nighthawk is truly an ugly bird. Its face is spotty as if splattered with mud. Its flat beak is sliced open from ear to ear. Its tottering legs mean it can barely walk. Whenever other birds see the Nighthawk's face, they feel revolted. One evening, the Hawk finally paid a visit to the Nighthawk's place. "Hey, are you there?" "Haven't you changed your name yet?" "You're a brazen-faced bird." "Look, you and I are of different natures." "I fly in the blue sky to anywhere I like." "You dare venture out only on dark, sunless days or at night." "Look at my beak and my talons." "Then closely compare them with yours." "Let me give you a suitable name." "Ichizo." "Ichizo, it is." "A suitable name, isn't it?" "Hang the name Ichizo from your neck." "Introduce yourself with your new name, Ichizo." "Pay a visit to all, and bow your head." "Fail to do that by the morning after next," "and I will catch you and kill you." "Catch you and kill you. Be warned." Miwa told me everything you told her. Why disclose my private life... That's the first thing you say? What's with you? So I'm just a step in your creative process? It may have started that way. But not now. We met because of your movie. When it's shot and done, are we done too? What is this relationship? Look, making this movie... Well, I'm embarrassed to say it. It's an expression of love. I thought you'd understood that. I've been alone all this time. Aiko, why'd you get involved in that book project? I don't know. First, it was a favor for Marie. And I believe having a birthmark is nothing shameful. I'm on the same page. You have the power to overturn social prejudice against people with nevi. You were that amazing. I wanted to join in with my own expression. But... Now, I feel like an outsider taking advantage of you. But I'm aware... now I'm simply justifying the pain I caused you. If you feel uncomfortable, we can stop the project. So it's my call? And I'll be responsible? That's not fair. Please let us continue. Sorry, I'll make it up to you another time. Very well. I... I felt happy to be a part of your movie. I was in it for the long haul. Finish what you started. Thank you. I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you for calling. Good. A nevus of this size will take time. But it's treatable. What? Each session costs 10,000 yen. After lasering, we apply a special tape. Stay out of the sun. I'd guess a minimum of two years to remove it. Well, can I think it over? Aiko, have you come to a decision? Huh? Are you staying on for a Ph.D.? Yes, that's my plan. Okay. I'm glad. To be honest, I'm afraid. Who wants to leave a place that feels like home? That's perfectly natural. Don't push yourself. But sometimes, you need to push yourself to grow. Maybe not. Pushing yourself to become a different person is just a fantasy. It's true people can change. But it doesn't mean you can be someone else. That's God's domain. I'm tired. So I'm going home. I don't push myself. You'll pull an all-nighter? Yes, for my presentation. All right. Don't push yourself. Okay. Wow, what's going on? I'm fixing the door to the storage room. Yes, it's an old building. - Well, I'm off. - See you. Hi, there. Hi. Are you processing your data? Let me help. But you'll miss the last train. I know. I'll work on these. You know... I learned my birthmark can be treated. Huh? Is that so? Why should you care? No, I'm just surprised. It takes time and money, though. But... Now I know it can be removed... I'm not sure I even want that. I like you no matter what. What's that? I've always had feelings for you. What? This is my confession. Since we're alone here. I don't know... How should I respond? Let's see. Then, how about... something like "Let's just be friends." And we can go out for lunch or a movie every so often. I don't know about that. I don't know, either. Aiko, did you hear about Miu? No, what is it? Miu's clothes caught fire at a BBQ. She's been badly burned. What? Come in. Have a seat. Okay. Does it hurt? A little. The surgery went well. But the scar is freakin' huge. Possibly... the scar can be removed. No guarantee, though. I'm sure they'll fix it. Thanks. I heard you're going on for a Ph.D. That's right. Maybe I should, too. Who'd hire a face like mine? Or maybe... Maybe getting a Master's was a mistake. In my family... My brother has depression and can't work. My folks aren't well, either. Sorry, I'm such a downer. No... You're always so cheerful. I never realized... See? I brought you down. No. I should apologize. I made you come along... for my clothes shopping and to get cosmetics. And to parties, too. You must've hated all that. Not at all. I was happy each time. Tiptoeing around me and my birthmark, everybody gets tired and then just disappears. You were always yourself to me. It's just... I've never really thought about your birthmark, to be honest. As a woman, I should know. I never considered your feelings. I realized it after my surgery. It's such an awful world, but you've survived. Actually... now I think I'm lucky to have this birthmark. Really? Yes. It showed me how to see people. It told me whom to trust. I knew I could trust you, Miu. That's sweet. It's just... I had the freedom to care for you before. But maybe I won't. Don't worry. You will stay what you are. Thanks. You cheered me up. I'm ready for the treatment. For Samba Carnival, too. Right. I can't wait to see you. See me? Just join the club, won't you? I'll think about it. Good. [Next week, let's talk stuff over.] All right, let's call it a day. How about a drink? I'm going home to work on a paper. How 'bout you? I have plans tonight. Plans? That means... Professor, don't ask. That means I have a date. Is that so? Let's take a raincheck, then. Actually, I'm available. Professor, let's get a drink. - You sure? - Yes. Okay, a guys' night out. Perfect. Don't miss your date. Enjoy yourselves. See you later. See you. What? Hello? Anyone? Can anyone hear me? Hello? [Tobisaka] Hello, Tobisaka? I'm glad you picked up. Tobisaka... Do you still love me? I want to see you tonight. Aiko, I'm sorry. Something urgent came up. So, yeah, let's reschedule. Sorry. Aiko? Never mind. I can't go today, either. Look... - I... - You and me... I don't think we'll ever change. It was like a dream... To meet you, to go out with you. Aiko, listen... So it ended just like that? Yep. The magic suddenly evaporated. Magic... I was right. You've changed, Aiko. Don't make fun of me. My bad. But... I was lucky to have met him. Yeah, yeah. Stop chattering. Let me finish. Okay. Good. It's done. Incredible. I know, right? After my discharge, I researched all the foundations. And this was the best. You keep it. Are you sure? Show just what you want, and don't worry about others. Humans wear clothes. That's our nature. That's true. I couldn't resist. Oh, Harada might get jealous. Stop it. I think he is a good choice. Says his bully! I only talk to nice guys. Aiko, you come here! Huh? But... You see? One, two, three... Left, right, left... Right, left, right... - Like this? - Yes! That's it. Now, your arms. - Like this? - Yes. This is Latin dance. Imagine we have feathers. Shake your feathers. Great. They're shaking. Then, faster. Twist your hips. Like this? Yes. Feels good, right? Well done. Beautiful. Dance more. Like this? Turn and jump. This? Good. You're doing great. This is Brazil. We've got feathers. [The Nighthawk's First Love] ©Rio Shimamoto/SHUEISHA ©2021 "The Nighthawk's First Love" Production Committee
