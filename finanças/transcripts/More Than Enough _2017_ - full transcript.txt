So you have to tell me what happened last night. Oh, wait! I already know. Download, I missed everything. Okay, but it's kind of gross. See Lee told me that he checked out the downstairs merch... and that Shelley was uh... Crusty Crusty? That's disgusting! That didn't happen. Special delivery. That's vag spray. Oh, shit! Smell dog, are you gonna cry? Attention students. Don't forget to clear your lockers. Enjoy your spring break... and we'll see you back on the 15th. Bye, Smells. I'm sure we'll hang out tons over the break. I am so done with her. Did you know that her mom is like, totally nuts? She's so extra. Did you see how many comments that picture is getting? It's got like, 200 likes already. - Hey, girls. - Hey, Wes. I mean, I'm gonna make a Twitter meme out of all those comments. Isn't Twinkle Toes over there coming? No. She's got sweaty yoga, or something. Oh, look, she's checking her phone. - Oh my gosh, she looks pathetic. - She does. Hey. Hey. Is that Emily's dad? That's West Thorne. He's her Godfather He's loaded, so he takes them on shopping sprees. I'm Greg. I know. You know, I'm pretty sure Emily set up a profile... for an STD-infected dog that has your name. Yeah... I keep getting tagged at Petco and the dog park. Hey You wanna bounce? Uhm, sure. - Hi, there. Can I help you? Well, let's see what kind of damage these girls can do. That's very generous. Anything for the children. She's beautiful. Your daughter? God daughter. Do you have any children? No. I'm all alone in this world. Oh, that's just terrible. I suppose you have a solution Wow. You have a really nice house. Oh, don't give me that. Why, did you assume the senior token class black guy... was a scholarship kid? Get in line. Everybody else does Well actually, I'm scholarship. Oh, the plot thickens. Come on. Welcome to my room. Give it a like, give it a comment. Or not. Did you do all these? Yes. Yes, I did. Wow. I mean some of these must have taken like... forever. Not really. I mean, I just geek out on them when there's nothing else better to do. Or no one to cyberstalk So who... Who you like, hang out with? I don't hang out with douche canoes. So my options at Walton are woefully limited. Isn't it kind of weird to just like, not talk to people? Isn't it weird to call people who make fun of you your friends? What are you into? Other than basic bitches on the STD fast track? I don't know. You don't know? I mean, I like music. - Music? That's all you need to say. What you are in for, Is an orgasmic delight... in the form of 33 RPMs. This is totally my jam. You ready? Sure. -You sure? I don't think you're you're ready. I think I'm ready. I'm pretty ready. Okay. Wait for it. Wait for it. I like these boots. Really? - Yeah. - Let me see. Do you think these would look good on me? Those would look amazing. What do you think? Different, Fierce. Let me see the jacket. Okay. Looks like, kind of like, this. Yes, bitch! I love it. I think this could be the you. "The you" Yeah, Do you. Be the you. Whatcha doin? I'm just... like, working on this song. You write songs? Like write-write? Well yeah, I mean like, that's what I wanna do, eventually. But for college, I'm applying for this songwriting program. But you have to audition, so, that's terrifying. Yeah, I bet. The audition's in like, a month. Can I see? No, No, it's really not finished... At all. Hey if you need some help I'm here... Seriously. Okay. Ugh, I feel kinda stupid being like that cliché girl... that's always like in the corner writing in her notebook. Is that douchey? No, No. Douchey is making grunting sounds in the gym. True Or like, talking about your calorie count. Or referring to your home as “a sacred place.” Saying everything is “artisanal.” Kanye West Man Buns The drop out. Referring to celebrities but only using their first name. Gwyneth recommends buying organic. Oh, that's the worst! No. Taking photos of your feet at the pool is the worst. Yeah, but I've done that. Like, one time. No... Who are you? You Be the you Be the you Be the you I'm so glad your goddaughter needed to go shopping. That was nice. Thank you. What do you mean, “Thank you”? That really hit the spot. Like a hot cup of coffee? Better 'n a cold one. Hey, girl, taste my dick? Oh, baby please, can I? Stop! Asshole. Shelly? Hey, Wes. What's goin' on? Oh. That guy was just... Nevermind. You need a ride somewhere? Yeah. Get in. So, you still live on Twambly, right? No, uhm... No. It's just down the road at 20th. So, what's the deal, Shelly? I haven't seen you hanging around Emily very much. Something happen? I'm just trying out this thing where I only hang out with people who are nice to me. Well, you rule out a lot of people that way. This is it, huh? Yeah, my mom sold the house when my dad left... and she spent a lot of the money, so, we're doing the apartment thing. All right, I'll walk you in. No, that's okay. I insist Been a while since I seen your mom. That's, my laptop. Hey, man. Who's this? President? President? Carl Wes. You got my vote. Shelly, have you seen my epi-pen? I've been looking for like, 20 minutes and I need it before I go to work. I saw mold again. - Black mold. Airborne. - Mom. - But I gotta take care of myself. - Mom, wait. Management denies it, of course and everybody's too scared to say anything. Mom, Mom! Mom. Mom! Even though everybody's running for the hills. Mom, stop. Mom. What is this? It's nothing. It's just ironic. We're a Christian family. Since when? What're you doing here? Hello, Veronica. Can I help? No! Mommy. Mom, please calm down - She's just a little wound up. She'll settle down Mommy, stop. Mommy? Oh my god. You took my pen. You did. - No. - Didn't you? - I don't know where it is. I don't know. - You better not be lying to me. - I'm not lying - Are you lying to me? - No! Where is it? I don't know. What are you wearing? It looks like something you got out of the garbage. Take it off. - Mom! - Take it off! Why don't we all just settle down. Okay. I need you to do this for me. Mom... - I gotta go to work. - You're having a panic attack. It's not allergies. You're the only one who can do this for me. I need you to help take care of me, okay? Make it stop. We don't have time to argue. I'm gonna be late. Just please, do this for me I need you to take care of me. All right? Thanks for the ride. 'Course. - Your mom is... - Sorry. Don't be. Careful that boyfriend He's not a good guy. I know Here's my card. If you need anything... anything... Call me, okay? Okay. Do you wanna talk about it? No... I mean, my mom's just like, not in the best place right now. That boyfriend sounds like a creeper, though. Yeah, that's the understatement of the year. I mean, he's using her bank card. Oh, shit. Well, don't let this ruin the rest of your spring break. What is that? A little anarchy. Plus, I think it's your color, girl. Let's put some black streaks in your hair. Bitches at school will freak. I'm sorry... You were saying? My attention... wasn't paying But rest assured That I'm not bored Rest assured -That I'm not bored -They're kind of awesome. -That I'm not bored - Yeah! She's such a badass! - That's gonna be you. Yeah. What's up, bro? - I'm gonna go and... - Go get him. Time to... bite my time No reason or no rhyme Focus Can't absorb What you spoke. Sponge won't soak. So glad you finally got here. I'm sorry.

I can't wait to live by myself - Yeah? - Yeah - Can I show you something? - What? I'm just gonna show you something. Come here. This side yard is just, it's kind of awesome. I just mean, in like, a few years, with like, a roommate... when I get enough money or, you know. - Yeah. - Yeah. You can do that. You can do whatever you want. - What? - Nothing. I've just... Never to be afraid Be the you Be the you that you are - What's that mean? - What did you mean? Hey, sugarfoot. We need to talk. Okay. I'm gonna get a coffee We got some really big news. You're kidding. And we're moving to Waco. My mama's been sick. Wait... Wh... What're you talking about? What about your job? They've been poisoning us. Have you not been listening to me? Mom, they're not poisoning you at the Hobby Fair... Doesn't matter They're gonna have to pay her some disability. What? No. No. I'm not going. No. Hey! Don't you disrespect your mom and me. Don't friggin' tell me what to do. You have to stop your crazy behavior! Me? I'm crazy? I'm the crazy one? Well, we're going so you better get packing! And you're grounded anyway! Holy shit! Are you okay? Hey! - Shit! Let's go! Go-go-go! - Get your ass back here! You hear me! Holy shit! You're a runaway! - Shit. What do I do? Well take the SIM card out. - Why would I do that? This isn't CSI. You okay? There ya go. Thank you. You should probably keep the light off in here... so my parents won't notice. They'd freak out and call your mom. Got it. You sure you'll be all right out here? I'm cool. I'm gonna be fine. All right. 'Night, runaway. Night. Take it off! At the tone, please record your message. You are in big trouble, you hear me? You better get back here. You're not gonna pick up the phone? Think you can just run off and take my half? You're a spoiled little brat. Wanna live on your own? Good luck. Shelly, my allergies are so bad I need to get somewhere with better air! Just call me, please, okay? You call me. We'll work something out, okay? Okay? Call me, baby. Changed your hair. Do you like it? Who cares if I like it? You like it? Good. You hungry? Order whatever you want. Just don't order the caviar. I hear it is not fresh here. I'm glad you called. Been a little worried about you. Things okay at home? Uhm... Not so much. Well my mom, she's off her Lithium and... she's decided to move to Waco with Carl... the alcoholic. Alcohol makes bad men behave worse. That's about the only thing I ever learned from my dad. It's just hard because... she really counts on me to help her when she gets like this. You can't take care of her. You're just a kid. I'm not a kid If you're in trouble... and you need some place to go, I got lots of room. Wait, for real? Yeah, why not? Could use a little excitement. Here. Thanks. You have a really beautiful house. Yeah, I do what I can. 'Scuse me. Is this you? No. - Shelly, what were you thinking! Carl's been driving all over town looking for you! He's so worried! Mom, I love you, but I'm not going to Waco. And if you try to make me go... I'm just gonna run away again. You're gonna have your hands full, just to warn you. What kind of heat you packin' here? Just a keyboard. I write songs. Let's hear something. No? Yeah, don't worry, I used to be shy, too. There's probably no hope for you either. Great. Get settled. We'll go get something to eat. All right? So what's the deal with this car? Mother gave it to me just before she died. Right. Do you like this music? It's wonderful. See the stars last night? No. Me neither. Saw the pollution. Beautiful. Hello Mr. Thorne. Thank you. Mr. Thorne! I used to be. Oh, he's so funny. Right this way. Hello. Hi, Alberta. Mr. Thorne, how are you? Alive, barely. Thank you Scotch, one ice cube. Thank you. So I'm guessing you come here a lot. I never been here before in my life. Oh, look who it is. Hello, Wes. Who do we have here? Saundra, this is Shelly, my ward. I found her wandering the streets of Montrose. And she moved in. You're living with Wes? Uhm... Yeah. How unusual. Wes is always so full of surprises. Yeah, I wish somebody would surprise me once in a while. Sit down, have a glass of wine. I was just on my way out, but thank you. I'll talk to you later. Shelly. Is that your girlfriend? You writing a book? She didn't seem very happy. Not many people are. - Well that's it for spring break. Back to school tomorrow. You ready? I guess. Thank you for dinner. You're welcome. Ew. Is that how you hug? What do you mean? With the pat on the back? It's like you're burping somebody. Here, let me burp you. Here. Somebody's gonna have to teach you how to hug, properly. You're really weird. Thank you. Good night. Be the you that you are Be your... be your own kind of star Take a breath Take a break Take a-take a... Let it roll... Morning. Can I get ya anything? I'm just gonna grab some of that coffee. Actually, do you have cereal? How 'bout some olives? Sure. I'll have an olive. Let's get you to school. What? Thorne Art Brokerage. Yup, I'll let him know. Hi. I'm here to see Wes. And you are? Shelly. Mr. Thorne, I have... Send her up. Okay. Hey, Wes. One second. Just finishing up. Where did you get all this stuff? Mom made it all before she died. No, really. Okay, well it all started with that stool right there the one in front. Furniture maker out of Beaumont, German immigrant. I found that on my way out to work in the oil fields one summer and... I just started going to all the small town flea markets. Sooner or later I was blowing all my paychecks on antiques. Didn't even have a place to live... just kept my collection in the trunk of my car. So, how was your first day back? That good, huh? You see Emily and the girls? Yeah. They're not really my friends. Actually, they probably never were. Don't worry about it too much. Can I go do some homework with a friend? What're we doing? I feel like going swimming. Yeah? Whose house is this? Who knows? Okay. Come on up. Ow. What if they're home? Well, if they are, then they're asleep. What if they wake up? Well, then they're gonna be surprised. Here. You don't know how to do this, do you? Suck. You have smoked before, right? Yeah. Couple of times. But, this is laced with speed so it makes you pretty alert. What? I'm just kidding. Take it easy. Okay. I don't have a bathing suit. Sure you do. Right here. Oh, it's cold, cold. Cold-cold-cold. Says the stone-cold fox. Thanks for the sarcasm. - Ironically cheesy, yes. Sarcastic, never. Hey! Who's out there! - I think we need to go. Pronto! Nice pad. - Yeah, I just stay here. I'm kinda this guy's ward. What does that mean? I don't know. Okay. All right, see ya. You're back. Yeah. Did you get lots of studying done? Yeah. Hair's wet. Yeah, we thought it'd be a fun idea to jump in the pool. I don't know who you were with... other than the fact that he drives a scooter. Not my job to police you. Am I in trouble? Should you be? No. Okay. I'll see ya in the morning. Doesn't show good character you know... driving off before somebody gets inside the door. But you'll learn that. “Do as I say, not as I do”? You heard all that, huh? It's a fascinating social experiment. Womanizer warns girl about the dangers of wayward men. Says the wayward woman. Don't worry, I'll let myself out the back. So, you're like, not even in trouble? No. I mean, he just told me to make my own decisions. It's weird, right? Swaag? That's dope! Shaine hasn't texted me back yet. I don't get it. Hot and cold. Playa in the house. And plus, older guys hang out with younger girls for pretty much one reason. Not Wes. Yeah but, you know it's a weird sitch. Plus he's still a guy. It's really not like that. Hey, if you say so. You really think this is a good idea? Let's just see if he's home. Can I help you? Is Shaine here? Shelly. Come in. Come in-come in-come in. What is that? It's called fun. You ever heard of it? You wanna try some? - Sure. - Yeah? Okay, come here. Use the straw to suck in the smoke, okay? Suck, suck, suck. It's better than coke, right? Here, clean straw. My eyes are watering. Here, have some. Okay, suck. Shelly, what're you doing? I'm sorry, I forgot you out there. Come in. - He can come in, right? - No. Let's go. Shelly, come on. I'm gonna stay. Honey, it's time to bounce. - Dude, chill. - Let's go! Don't be such a fuckin' fag, Greg. Relax. - Oh-oh. - Oh, she didn't. Shit. Greg! Greg, wait! I'm so sorry... I did not mean to say that. But you said it. Thought you were my friend... Turns out you're just like all those other bitches. At least you called me a fag to my face. Greg! Shit! Shaine. Go away. The door is closed for a reason. Hey. Everything okay? Hey-hey-hey-hey. Come here. Okay. Can't be that bad. Think about what to do Think about what to say But everything turns to shit... The you that you... It's better than coke, right? That you... - Be a screw-up! - Ironically cheesy, yes. You're the only one who can do this for me. I need you... - to help take care of me, okay? - Shelly! Be the you that you... I think this could be the you. You have to stop your crazy behavior! I thought you were my friend. Be the you that you hate You be That you are Wes, stop. What are you doing? Did you see the stars? No, but I saw the pollution and it was beautiful. All right, get up, let's go, we got stuff to do. Not gonna let you mope. Time to get inspired. There's a lot of great work here. You have to pick a favorite. Only one? Yup, that's the game. I like this piece. It's original. It doesn't apologize. I like this one. It's lonely. It's like an awesome moment, that can't last... and you kind of wish it would. What're we doing here? We are... shopping for a dress for you to wear to a party. What kind of party? The kind I don't want to go to, so you're coming with me Can I help you? You're unbelievable. You love it. Admit it. It is pretty. I wanna show you this other one. Hold on. I was wondering why you never called but now I get it. You're sick. Do you know that? Great. Glad we cleared that up. Is that a tux? Where'd you find that? I don't have to tell you everything. Do you like it? You look like... 1,376,000 bucks Love it. That's the one. Looks great. Thank you... Molly. So, uhm... what exactly is this party for? It's to honor a guy who donated a bunch of money. See, the idea is to shame the other people into giving more. That's basically what a gala is. Just an excuse to dress up and guilt people. Well that's messed up. Most things are. Thank you. Hi, Wes. Marion. Who's this? Oh, this is Shelly. My fiancée. You're joking, right? Oh. With this one, you never know. Nice to meet you, dear. Excuse me. What? Thank you. The infamous Wes Thorne. I used to be. Hello, everyone. Thank you for being here tonight. My wife, Sandy, and I are delighted to be hosting this event. All proceeds from the silent auction will benefit the museum fund. Now of course, the museum, as we know it, would not be here... if it weren't for the efforts of tonight's guest of honor... Mr. Wes Thorne. Mr. Thorne? Thank you, Dale. It was more than enough. I only have one thing to say. And that is... So, what does “more than enough” mean? That's just something I say to confuse the hell out of people. You don't tell 'em if it was good or bad, you just say... It was more than enough I didn't know that Saundra was married. Well, most of the great ones are. You seem a little sad. The world's a little sad. Those ladies are staring at us. Are they your friends? I don't have any friends. Yes, you do. Sometimes a room full of people can be the loneliest place in the world. It's less lonely if you're not the only one who realizes it. All right, it's late. - Get some sleep. - Okay. Thank you for tonight. It was really cool. Yeah. You made that... almost bearable for me, too. Thank you. Love you - Oh. No-no-no. What're you doing? I just thought that... - No. You didn't think. - I'm sorry. That's not what this is about. Listen to me. If you think that's all you have to offer... then it's all you ever will have. Please don't be mad at me. I'm not mad. I'm not, I'm not, Shelly. You have so much more to give this world. But if you don't start believing that, nobody else is going to. Get some sleep Mom. Happy birthday. Hope you're having fun in that... Fancy mansion with frozen grapes and servants and... whatever the hell else goes on over there. Mom, are you okay? I'm worried. I'm fine. You're the one that's messed up, okay, not me. Let me ask you a question. Have the cops called you? - What're you talking about? - No, 'cause they know everything. And they're gonna blow the top off this whole thing, okay? - Mom. You need help. No, I got the CFO running for the hills, all right? And, they got dirty cops and Carl knows. Mom, I have to go. Shelly? Shelly? Don't you hang up on me! Shit. Please stop being mad at me. Do you wanna maybe go grab a coffee at Brazil after school? It'll be my treat. Or, maybe you could help me with my song? Sorry, I have some fagotry to attend to. Please, Greg, I really miss you, and I could really use a friend today. Oh. You feel like no one gives a shit? Sucks, doesn't it? Hey. Is anyone else here? No. Let's get obliterated. You have cash, right? - Well, I'm selling for a friend. It's legit. I got you this, too. It's a little birthday present from me, okay? Shit! Real nice. Sorry... Just lost track of time. Get in. My mom called this morning... and she said all kinds of crazy stuff... And then nobody remembered my birthday. Are you mad at me? Are you mad at you? Stop sign! Shit. Good evening, Officer. Did you see the stop sign back there? Yeah, I... I'm sorry, we were talking. I missed it. - License and registration. - Yeah. Where you headed tonight? Home. This your daughter? I'm her guardian. Been drinking? No, sir. Please step out of the vehicle. Okay. Is this... Step out of the vehicle, please. Officer, I don't understand what's going... Turn around, face the vehicle, and place your hands behind your back. Okay, but what's the issue? Turn around, face the vehicle... place your hands behind your back! You don't really have to stay. Actually, I do. His attorney is on his way to get him out right now. Everything's gonna be okay though, right? None of this is okay, Shelly. Frankly, I don't even know what you're doing here. You have a family, don't you? You have a husband, don't you? Why are you here? Hi. Hi. Thank you for doing that. Mhm. - So you're mad at me too, huh? That's great. Wes. Yeah, I'm angry. What did you expect? You're hanging around a very young, very troubled little girl. I don't know who's taking advantage of who, at this point. Oh, come on, Sandy. - You don't like the way it sounds? Imagine how it looks, Wes. I see the way you look at her. Really? How's that? Enlighten me. Like a lonely, bored man standing on one side of a line... looking for any excuse to cross it. She's just a messed up kid. And I'm her meal ticket. And yes, I am bored. Thought taking in a stray dog might be an adventure. So what? You of all people should know me better than that. That's the thing. I don't know you, Wes. Nobody knows you. Nobody even comes close. How much of that did you hear? I'm sorry I'm such a problem. What're you doing? Put that bag away. - Watch out, stray dogs bite. - Don't push me, Shelly. Don't push me, Shelly. I have had people grilling me about you for four hours. I defended you. Why didn't you stick up for me? What are you talking about? I have done nothing but defend you. You think it's gonna be easy for me... to explain to a judge what a handful of Mexican mind eraser pills are doing in my car along with a teenage girl I'm supposed to be taking care of. Then why do it? You're not my father. You're not anyone's father. Yeah, you're right. I'm not. I don't have to be helping you. I'm choosing to. There's a difference. Oh... and happy birthday. Thank you. The painting is amazing. I'm really sorry about last night. I got messed up and I did some really stupid stuff. It's never gonna happen again. And I just want you to know that I really appreciate... everything that you've done for me and I'm really sorry. Don't be sorry. Be better. Maybe I'm not the one to be taking care of ya. Having you come here might've been a mistake. No, you're helping me. Please, you have to believe me. What I was hoping... was that you would... believe in yourself. How can I do that when I can't... stand myself most of the time? Stop letting other people define you. You've gotta start letting people love you. I didn't ask you to sit down. I put bros before hos... and that makes me a complete asshat. I'm a tattoo of an Ed Hardy design. That's how toolish I am. Go on. I'm... douchier than YOLO. Douchier than asking for bottled water by brand name? Douchier than a vest with no shirt. Douchier than toe rings? Douchier than going backstage at a Kid Rock show. Douchier than mustache wax? Douchier than hashtag blessed? Douchier than saying Namaste in a regular conversation. Oh god, that's really douchey. I'm really sorry. I know Forgiven. Plus... I miss you. But keep your shit together, and no hate speech. Okay. What is that? Oh. I got into Syracuse. What? That's amazing. I mean, I knew you would. Your art's so good, but. So, Mr. Syracuse... do you wanna help me with something? What do you have in mind? Wait. What're you all up to? Hello. Hey. It's almost eleven o'clock. Well, Greg and I were working on a project. It's kind of top secret. What is that? Is that paint? Yeah, it's an art project. It'll all make sense, eventually. Oh, I hope so. I spoke to your mom tonight. What did she say? She said Waco's not really panning out, but I... don't wanna get into all that tonight. Okay? I just wanted you to know that she was all right. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Good morning, Mr. Thorne. Oh yeah, good's the word. Mr. Thorne, there's someone here to see you. This is a nice setup you got here, man. What do you want? Oh, crap. Hey. I got my audition scheduled. It's in a week. What are you doing? Making dinner. I wanted to surprise you. I think I've had enough surprises for one day. Did you see the stars? Yup. Clearest sky I've seen in years. That was... That was very sweet. It's rare when somebody does something nice like that... so I guess I'm not... exactly sure how to respond. Are you hungry? Mhm. Let's go out and eat. You don't even wanna try this? -No. This body's a temple. Come on, let's go. What're you doing? You're gonna be late. I can't decide what to wear. Well, why don't you wear what you got on. That'll make a statement. Come on, this audition is a really big deal for me. Well, I'd tell ya that the song was great and all that... but you haven't let me hear it. It might really suck. Wes, I'm really nervous! - You gotta lighten up. You're way too sensitive. Look, the reality is, they're either gonna like it or they won't. It's not gonna change who you are. And for god's sake, try to have some fun. Okay? It's not that big a deal. Okay. Let's go. We're late. Thank you. Shelly Ackerman? Hi, my name is Shelly Ackerman and... I'm auditioning for the spring semester. So I'm just gonna... I'm gonna sing a song.

That was amazing! Wes, wait! What's wrong, was it bad? No. It was not bad. It was... More than enough? I was wrong... when I told ya you were too sensitive. That's the best part of you. Shelly? Mom, what're you doing here? Wes called me. You did? Why don't I give you two a moment. Wait... You were amazing. I don't know who you got it from. Not from me. Carl left me. It was the best thing that could've happened to me. I got treatment. I'm on medication. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry. - I wasn't well. I'm really sorry. So you're on medication now... and you just expect things to just be magically okay? No... I broke things. But, I'm your mother. And I love you. Do you expect me to live with you? Eventually. I have to go. Why did you do that? Why did you call her and tell her to come? She's your mother, Shelly. You don't want me here anymore? That is not true. Your mama's boyfriend came to me trying to hustle me for this and that... And I... and I gave him some money to go away. And I offered to help her. Why? I was so mad at my mom... for staying with abusive boyfriend number three. I didn't go to see her when she was sick. I guess I was trying to punish her. But, the person I ended up... punishing was... me. I gave up on her. I have regretted that decision ever since. What if she falls apart again? If it doesn't work out... if you need me, you've always got a room here. Always. 'Cause we're friends. You know how rare it is to have a real friend in this world? Yeah, I think I do. Ow. What, are you stealing my moves now? That's my move. Yeah, well now you have to share it. You got everything, Sugarfoot? Yeah, I think so. One sec. You're so weird. See ya soon. Okay. What is this music? It's wonderful.
