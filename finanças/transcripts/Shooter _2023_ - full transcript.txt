'Myself Sada Nair. Encounter specialist, Mumbai Police.' 'I conducted several encounters in my life.' 'My eyes never became moist.' 'If my eyes became moist today, the reason is Ghulam.' 'Ghulam was one of the countless people coming to Mumbai...' '...with dreams in his eyes.' 'There was only on person in that crowd he could call his own.' 'It was his younger brother Imtiaz.' 'Primarily he made some trivial deals...' '...following which he became a Police informant.' 'Loyal to me.' 'But he had to pay a big price for this fame and fortune.' 'Losing his dear brother's life.' They were hiding in Madhuban lodge. In Dahisar. Dark-skinned Sunil tipped me off. No, bro! I made a mistake. - Bro, he.. - He attacked me back. I beat them up like dogs! - Yeah, bro. Like a dog! - Spare me just once. He killed our Imtiaz! He was killed on Dada's command, bro. Else he would not have killed him, Don. I only killed him because Dada said so, bro. Yes! Will you kill him or not? I will shoot him, bro. I will shoot anyone you tell me to shoot! Look. I will shoot anyone you say. - Will you shoot him or not? - I will, bro. Darn you. Scumbag! I killed Imtiaz, bro. I give you my word. I will anyone you say. He killed our Imtiaz, bro. - I will kill, bro. - Please forgive us this time, bro. Please forgive me this once, bro. Anwar gives you his word, bro. I will kill anyone you tell me to kill. Say something. Spare me. I will shoot anyone you tell me to shoot, bro. - Bro... - It was a blunder, bro. - No, bro! - Please don't kill me, bro. We messed up. Anyone you say... Don't kill me, bro! Bro, spare me. Forgive me once. I'll kill anyone you say. Bro, don't kill me. - Please don't shoot! - No, bro! No. - No, bro! No!. - Don't kill me. Please forgive me once. - No, bro. - No. Bro, no. No. 'When Ghulam moved forward burning up with revenge in his heart...' '...he realized that...' - '...circumstances made him a shooter.' - Shoot him, bro! 'Not only did Ghulam kill his brother's murderer that day...' ...he also killed the human being within him.' Out of the way! We have a scapegoat, Don. Mukesh from Jogeshwari is here. I asked him to sit over there. - Here. Have some tea. - No, bro. I don't want tea. I have diabetes. - What's the matter? - A jeweler has his money. Three point five. I haven't said told him what it will cost. You tell him. Ten million lump sum. Malik has shifted from Singapore to Dubai. He will run his gang from there hereafter. I am writing a book on you, sir, which is based on Police and crime. I feel that nobody knows the Police and crime as well as you do. Where were you, bro? I called you four times. I was at the court, sir. For a chick? A broad. It was a minor issue. Have you met him? He's a very good reporter. RD. - Write a story on him. - Sir. He is a character. An informer. He is half a cop. I want to open up the Malhotra family matter. Tell me who killed him! I haven't done anything. - Sir. - Huh? I know nothing, sir. No. I have done nothing, sir. - What are you doing, sir? - Tell me quickly! Talk. Talk now. I killed him. I killed him. - You killed him, right? - I killed him. Put the douchebag in! Drink this urine. Go on. A shooter needs a strong mind, not a strong body. Drink urine in the mornings. Your mind will become strong. You will become powerful. You will be capable of taking a beating. Get it? Yes, boss. What did you say? Who killed Malhotra? I swear on my parents. I confessed to get out of being beaten. Ahhhhhh! I killed Malhotra. I did. Finished the whole family. Money. I want money. Spill the beans. Go on. Spill the beans. Who else is involved? 'Ghulam was a little more than an informant...' '...and a little less than a Policeman.' Look in front. Look in front. Is he here? Yes, sir. He is with his family. Your bones will be crushed if you get up, boy! Leave. Let's leave. 'The co-ordination between us helped me succeed at several encounters.' Hey! Hey! Hey! - Careful. His expression was priceless. He was acting like a hero, sir, but when you revealed the gun, he went off right there. He wet his pants. Down. Sit down. Tell me about your family. There's me, sir. I don't know about my father's whereabouts, sir. I have a younger sister, sir. Sorry, sir. Who is the bread winner? I have a brother, sir. He has a wife and young kids. He takes care of our sister. He takes care of the whole family. I am the only person he does not take care of. So you are dispensable. What is this, sir? You were talking to him so politely I thought you would spare him. - Hey! Bring the ambulance. - Okay, sir. Encounter specialist Sada Nair shot down two of Malbari's sharp shooters... ...in an encounter in Kandivali. He shot Sonu shooter two days ago... ...and today he shot down Pappu Konkani and Bandya alias Balkrishna. This is deemed as a big success for Mumbai Police. You handed these two to that Policeman, bro. Did you talk to him about our commission? He will give it to us. If these people keep going down like this we stand to benefit from it. What goes is this dirty money, bro? The Police killed them like dogs at the end of the day. Hey, pansy. You know nothing. They didn't indulge in petty stuff. They were shooters. Their lives aren't longer than this. Keep your mouth shut now. I've come here to fulfill your task. Will the Policemen give his corpse to the family, bro? Look at where his mind is wandering. Be quiet, all of you. Will you let me do my job or not? Look, bro. He is giving an interview. If this chap kills he is called a shooter but if he kills he is a hero. - Sir. - Sir, - this is my younger brother Imtiaz.. - Hello. You are my hero, sir. I'm a big fan, sir. He just passed his exams, sir. He did very well. Study and achieve something in life. Don't become like him. - Understand? - Yes. - Sir, his admissions.. - Yes, yes, I'll do it. I will do it. Don't stress yourself. 'Ghulam loved his brother to death..' '...and there were some people who loved Ghulam to death.' 'Maruti, Bhawrya and Pinky.' My God! What have you done, Ghulam? - You broke the bottle! - Don't say a word to bro! - He killed our boss. - Get lost! Get a grip on your emotions! It drives me crazy if anyone touches you! Take me home then. Why do you let me go there at all? Do you think the people will venerate me if I go there? They are bound to touch me. Why else would they give me money? Then go to them! Why are you telling me this? I am telling you it is for the money but I don't sleep with them because I love you. When will you get it? May I say something? I loved it when you broke the bottle on his head. You do love me, scoundrel! So why is it I can only see your love when you are upset? Hey. Please say that you love me. Say I love you. I won't let you do it. Say I love you first. Come on. Why are you making a fuss? Say I love you! I've been working on your mood for so long! Can't you say I love you? You don't have an ounce of romance in you. 'He was befuddled between Pinky's love and the rat race in the world.' 'Both their ways of love were unusual nevertheless it was love.' 'He would be willing to do anything...' '...when driven by the emotions of his loved ones.' 'He put my family above his loved ones on his list of loved ones.' 'Ghulam had several qualities that the Police required.' 'So did the underworld.' Hey, bro. I want two that are German made. Who referred you to bro? How will it help if you knew? Your bro knows me very well. - Do you want cash? - Hey, hero! - Hey! - Hey! You will be put down right now. Yes, bro. Two wise guys have approached me, bro. They want a pigeon and seeds. Do you have any? I know him. He is Malbari's crony. Don't bring him to me. It doesn't appear that way. Hand the phone to him. Hand him the phone, slime ball! Here. Hello. It's Lalya, bro. You know who I work with. I want two pigeons but your wise guy is hesitating to bring me to you. 60 for one and 120 for two. No. Let's meet and discuss this, bro. What good will meeting me do? 120 is the final price. Give some advance money to the boy standing with you. You said one month, didn't you? One month has passed and so is your bro. - Brother, the market at the time.. - Listen to him. Don't talk. I had to repay many other people That's why I could not repay you, Don. I told you, brother. Do not interrupt! Don't you see I am talking? Didn't you send 50 lakhs to Malbari? Malbari threatened me, Don. You should have mentioned my name. Is there anyone above me in Mumbai? Go. 'Underworld Don Gotya. He daringly ran his domain...' '...at the entrance of the Court where he was being tried...' ...for extortion and murder.' You hit my brother in a bar. You broke his head. He is still unwell. I want to hit him, brother! Hey! You want to go and philander in a bar! You couldn't hit him there. You think you can hit him here? Hah! You know how to cut a deal with the Police. You know the worldly ways too. Do something for me. I want to someone shot. Sorry, Don. I am not a shooter and I am not interested in becoming one. In that case find me three new boys. What will I get for it? I will pay 20000 each to the shooters and 5000 for each shooter to you. It will cost 40000 per shooter and I get 10000 for each one. Okay. Got it. But I won't ask for a refund if they fail to do the job. I will have you shot with the same money. The job will be done, Don. Stay in touch with him, Anwar. Go. 'He wasn't working exclusively for the Police.' 'Ghulam used to do some jobs dishonest to the Police.' 'He had several contacts to get those jobs done.' I am the only one in all of Mumbai to give you cars at this rate. Setting Nepali. His name reflected his work. Ghulam is here to see you, sir. Well, well, well. You have become a big shot! - You don't answer my calls. - I was busy with a job for sir. My phone was switched off. Come out for a minute. I want to talk. Sada is holding two of my cronies for stealing a car. How much will it cost? Tell me. Sada doesn't accept bribe. And I don't want anything either. Do something for me. I thought so. You wouldn't come here unless you needed something. I want shooters. It's a big job. Don't ask for details. You scratch my back and I will scratch yours. You know Santosh from Mumbra? Tell him to come and see me. It will be done. I don't want it. Quit this, brother. Please listen to me. I don't want to be an Engineer, brother. I want to be a driver. - I don't want to do engineering. - Let's go. Do you know how much it costs... - ...to become an engineer? - Let him do his job now. Hold on! Hold on. - Let's go. - Stay away. Stop interfering! I too am your brother. Listen to me. I don't want to be an engineer, brother. I don't want to! You... Money is nothing but money. It does not say on the notes what it's meant to be used for. Your job is to study and my job is to provide you with an education. I raised you, didn't I? Scoundrel! It's okay. Go away. - Sir. Sir. Sir. Go away. - Let's go. - I don't want to be an engineer! - Alright. Let's go now. - Do you want to die here? Do you want to die here? Come on. Let's go now. Move it. I provided you with all that education so you could be a driver? - Scumbag! - No, no, no. Let's go. - Why are you upsetting bro? - Bro, you'll end up in trouble. I will acquire the money and you will study! Doesn't matter how I acquire it! Have my three boys arrived at the location, bro? Then you owe me my commission. When will I get it? I will send Maruti to you. He's my man. I want it urgently, Don! Those three guys are useless, bro. Tell Anwar to send me there. I will shoot. We will get all the money. If I get caught then so be it. How does it matter? You'll have money to Imtiaz admitted. You want to be a shooter?! You want to languish in jail?! I shall willingly languish for Imtiaz's sake. You want to die in an encounter, rascal? Get lost! I need money, sir. What for? For my brother's admissions. I introduced you to Paranjpe. I got my officer to call just for you. Imtiaz approached him. He says don't bother educating your brother. They charge 10 lakh rupees for admissions. You have to pay him at least 2.5 lakhs. I managed to get hold of 1 lakh rupees, sir. It would be nice if you could lend me some. How can I give you money? My salary is 40000 rupees. I need to talk to you in private, sir. These guys are not unfamiliar to you. Tell me. Kotian's Anwar came to me. I arranged 3 shooters for him. Wonderful! You won't mend your ways. You are standing in a Police station telling a Policeman... ...you arranged for three shooters. If I hadn't done it someone else would have done it, sir. But this information is concrete. You will get hold of Malbari. This is insufficient, sir. - This is Maruti, bro. - Yes. I got the money, bro. 30000. Only 30000? Imtiaz is leaving in the morning. If I don't get hold of the money by morning he will lose one year. - I need 3 lakhs. - Let me do something. I have 1.5 lakhs. 1.5 lakhs. I will return it to you later. This is today's collection. I will be left 50000 after I pay the hotel. Ask Shabeer if he will loan me the money on interest. Shabeer will demand gold as collateral. He is very fussy. You know that. Can't you sleazebags do anything? Tomorrow morning the money.. I told you I do the shooting, bro. I am willing to go in jail for Imtiaz. Hang up, you slimebucket! Uncle Ganya. This is Ghulam. I know you but you don't know me. I have some important information. - Brother Malbari. - Huh? Make the call. Take this. Kotian has sent three shooters, bro. Encounter specialist Sada Nair arrested three shooters... ...near Haji Ali last night. It is believed that Kotian sent three shooters to kill Malbari... ...because of an old grudge. Malbari tried to escape at the last minute but the Police nabbed him. Take care when you take this money with you. Just give me a call if anyone makes trouble for you over there. I will come and teach him a lesson. Don't be afraid. Get it? You have done a lot for me. Take care of yourself. And don't get into those shenanigans. It's your life. Don't destroy it. Stop. Are you a child? Hello. Did you inform the Police about the spot where Malbari was supposed to go, bro? The shooters we sent for Kotian got arrested and so did Malbari, bro. That is a double game, bro. Kotian will not spare us, bro. We shall deal with it. What will he do? Never mind him! What's the matter? It's nothing. Our daily business. You leave. Take a taxi and leave. I will get there in 20 minutes. Yes, bro. Rush, here. Rush here, bro. You've done something illegal. How did you get hold of so much money? I will deal with my business. - You've done something wrong! - Turn around and get a cab. Hurry up. Leave! Let's get going! Move it! Don will dress you up. Let's go without a fuss! - Come with us without a fuss! - Move it! Let's go else you can shoot him! Come on. Grab him! Come down, scoundrel! Come! Talk to him, Don. Take that. Good going, bro. Malbari is alive today only because of you. Go and kill Malbari. I will spare your brother. How can I kill him, Don? The third bullet will go in his head. Don't waste time. Anwar will brief you with the rest. Your brother is in our custody. Get it? Do you want him alive or not?! This contains six bullets. Pump them all into him. I want the magazine empty when you get back! Understand? I want to see it's game over. Go now. Take this coat and go inside! Put this in there. - Leave! - Move it. Kotian killed your brother but I am with you. Malbari. Move. Move it. Go. What are you looking at. Go. Ahhhhh! Run! - Run. - Go there. Police. Run. Run. Over there. In that direction. Quick. Your younger brother is gone... ...and God has given you an older brother today. You killed Kotian... ...but you are not a shooter yet in the eyes of the law. Also, I will not force you to get into the business. You are free as far as I am concerned but if you wish to work for me my doors will always be open to you. The rest is up to you. I want Vishi Anwar and his brother alive. Please listen to me, bro. Bro. Boss, give me a chance. "Hail Ganesh. Hail Ganesh. Hail Lord Ganesh." "His mother is Parvati and his father is Mahadeva." "His mother is Parvati and his father is Mahadeva." "He has one tooth, he is merciful and has four arms." "He has one tooth, he is merciful and has four arms." "Vermillion on his forehead, riding a mouse." "Vermillion on his forehead, riding a mouse." He always said, 'I will bring fame to you when I grow up, brother.' 'Don't do anything illegal.' I'm glad he died. The scoundrel. I will not take a beating from the world hereafter. Nobody will be able to stop me hereafter. I will not follow anybody's instructions. Ghulam. What's done is done, Ghulam. Life is all about ups and downs. I know that you reacted to the circumstances. You have your whole life ahead of you. Look, please surrender. I will do everything I can for you. You are aware that no witness will come forth. You will be released within a few days. Okay? That Ghulam who you shaped no longer exists. I am a shooter now. You can add my name to the list of criminals now. Look, Ghulam.. Ghulam. This is the sixth day since tayee has been on a hunger strike. Tayee wishes to talk to you. Everyone has a right. Everyone has a right. I'll be right back. Cow is like our mother. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Where are you going? He is from my village, sir. I don't care. Just leave. - Let me go, sir. - Move it! Move it! Cow is like our mother. Where is it? The site where our Chief Minister Prabhakar Rao Rawate wishes to build a 5 star Hotel, do you know who it belongs to? It has been set aside for our army personal... ...where they will have homes. The army personal who serve our country and lay down their lives for us. 00:33:11:07 00:33:12:0 Applause. Everyone has a right. Cow is like our mother. We will ensure the army personal get that which is rightfully theirs. We will reclaim that site no matter what! I have been receiving death threats for many days now. Some people want to take my life even today. But I am not concerned about them. Cow is not like our mother. - Anna. - Hmm. Someone is here from Amravati to see tayee. Tayee is asleep. Bandu sent someone. Look, he has a letter too. He came this morning as he had some business with her. It has become urgent now. He wants to see her. Does tayee know about it? Yes, sir. That's what it says. She knows. Come. - Tayee. - Hmm. Someone is here to see you. Who is it? Tayee! Tayee! Well done, boy! Why didn't you kill me in my sleep? Huh? At least this innocent wouldn't lose his life. One bullet isn't sufficient for me. Two more bullets will be required for me. 'In the eyes of the law Ghulam had become a shooter.' 'Internally Ghulam was shook up by the social worker's murder.' Coming! Where is Maruti? So many times I told him not to leave you alone at night but he doesn't.. I don't need anyone. I am in my senses. Get it? Have you eaten? Eat your food. I prepared food for you. In two minutes I.. Wait! Do you know I did not go to work today? I wore this sari and waited here since evening. I'm very pleased today. It's your birthday. This is a very special day for me. Today is a very special day for me as well. I killed two people today. My parents brought me in this world for their own pleasure and then they got rid of me. And I am a shooter today. I want to forget this and you remind me of it! Tayee's death killed every emotion... ...and every feeling within him forever. Pinky hoped Ghulam would change someday but the fact was that Ghulam was changing every day. The Police's tool was gaining fame in the underworld now. Underworld Don Malbari was using Ghulam like a pawn and he went from being Ghulam to a contract killer. 'For the first time Ghulam shot Datta Dighe, the opposition leader right in front of me.' What are you two taking pictures? It is for the Police station. Your brother Ghulam has become a shooter. I have to put it up as he is wanted. What does shooter mean, papa? Keep him in his place, Don, else he will get too big for his boots someday. These are very affluent people from Dubai. They are into import and export. The job is a little dicey. That's why you are required. It's a very big business... ...and so is the money. Neither am I interested in your business... ...nor in the money. I went through so much to get to you but you broke my heart. This is my card. I shall wait for your call. My doors will always be open to you. For everything. I want to talk to you. About what? I will hit you. Be quiet. I want to talk to you! I am carrying a three month fetus. Yours. Abort it. Wonderful! That means you were in it only for the pleasure. Not the responsibility. Don't twist things! I come to you because I get peace over here. Even I have nobody but you in my life. You know that there is no guarantee on my life. A bullet is waiting for me in someone's gun. The day it gets a chance it will be game over. But I love you. You love me, right, Ghulam? Then let's go over somewhere. Anywhere you wish. We will begin a new life with the baby. It is up to you, Ghulam. Nothing is up to me! I don't know why I am still living. I don't know for what I am living. I cannot take on this responsibility. Hah! You have always been selfish. I invested my whole life in you. What did I gain from it? I accepted you exactly as you were... ...because I knew that you loved me. Stop it. But today I see a stranger in you. Someone who comes here to relieve himself. Stop talking! Or I shall shoot you! Shoot me! Shoot me! End this story today! I know you can't even do that! You can't even take on this responsibility. You won't be paid for it. Take this. Abort the rascal! Hey! I will surely give birth to the child! Because I am living for the child, not you! It is my own. I don't need your charity to raise it. Keep your ill-gotten gains with you! I wanted money for which you would shed blood, sweat and tears, not money that is drenched in someone's blood. Look here! Don't be adamant! You will regret it. I will never regret it as I love my Ghulam even today! And that's not you! Hence you are dead to me hereafter and I am dead to you! Get out of here! Die, witch! Die! Crime reporter RD has exposed the oil mafia to the public and the media today, for which he has received threats. He is on the phone with us today. Sir, we have heard that you have been receiving threats - ever since you exposed the oil mafia. - I don't want to eat, mama. - Watch it. - No. I am not afraid of threats. I shall carry out my duty. Yes, sir. What's going on? You are all over the TV. How will the authorities take action if we don't expose the mafia to the public, sir? I have some more news for you, sir. Riyaz is in Mumbai. Riyaz? He is the mastermind of the current terrorism. The entire thing is a contribution of his evil mind. Riyaz has connections with the underworld for local support, sir. This link will surely take you to Riyaz. Sir! Sir! Sir! He has many secrets. Sir! Come here, douchebag! - Sir! No, sir! - No, sir. It is painful. I told you, sir. Ahhhhhhhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhh! Malbari, sir. Hadley involved Malbari, sir. He was summoned to Pakistan once, sir. He was summoned to Pakistan, sir. Pakistan! Morning, sir. Hadley is Lashkar's man, sir. - Hmm? - I have evidence. Yes, sir. Here you go, sir. Dubey. Bring it here. Bring the tape. Hadley's discussion with Malbari, sir. Did Mr. Malik talk to you about me? I have come from abroad. I need an extremely confidential man for Indian admission. Someone who can help me in every way in Mumbai. I want a man who has connections at every level. I shall transfer an amount into your account as Mr. Malik mentioned. You will get the remaining amount later. Alright? I need this done at the earliest. After this Malbari spoke to his confidante from Mumbai. Rangya. Even he is on to the tape, sir. Listen. Tell Ghulam to see me. No matter what. Mr. Malik has talked about a big job, sir. Hadly needs local support. He is talking about Ghulam. You are so late! We won't get a rickshaw now. We shall talk when we get there. - Pinky. - Hmm. You've been prohibited from going to the bar. Why? You felt dizzy and passed out at the bar yesterday. The boss knows you are into your second trimester of pregnancy. I'm going. You? So early in the morning? Is everything okay? Can I get some alcohol? Yes, Ganya. What is it? Huh? Yes, sir. Really? Give me. Give me. What is the matter? You are very thirsty today? What happened? I just felt I should come to you today. I have no idea why I came here. If there's anything I can do for you, I'm willing to do it. How many more numbers are you going to change? Sir. It has been a long time since I heard your voice. I learned this from you. Did you learn from me how to shoot someone in the rear end? You are fortunate you are still safe. I have some business with you. - Hey! - Go. Go. Right. Right. Riyaz is in Mumbai. Riyaz? The terrorist. He is in Mumbai. I hear he's going to do something very big. I have information from the IB. He approached Malbari for local support. He has offered him money and a bar. I have tapes of both of them. What can I do about that, sir? Go and see him. You are his right hand. Take on this contract from him. Sir, I worked for you so many years. Did I ever unfaithful? I worked for you honestly. Today I work for Malbari. don't interfere in Malbari's matters. You slime ball! You are a shooter! A shooter! A criminal. I am a Policeman but I am seeking your help for the safety of the public, for the country, not for me. Why are you discussing the country with me, sir? I am a small man. Why do you want to involve me in this muddle, sir? Let me know if you need help in a personal matter. What personal help can you help me with, you sleaze ball?! You dare to teach your father when to do it, how to do it, do it during the day or during the night! You are finished, pimp! Traitor! There's no humanity left in you. Those sleaze bags enter into our country because of slime balls like you. Fine. Bear in mind I will not spare you! Bloody douchebags! I won't spare even one of you! That was the Officer. Sir. Sir... Get back! - Don't touch me, Officer! - Throw him out. - Move! - Leave me alone, Officer! Bring him out! - You can't do that. Hey! Show respect if you want to talk to me else take me to Court. - Come to your senses, you scum. - Let go, scumbag! Who do you think you're hitting? Think about it. You coward! I will put out a contract on you! You don't know Hadley, right, Sleaze bag? And yet you will support him? No. He will die, Officer! Sleaze ball! He will die, Officer! Let him be, Officer. He will die. I want to get Sada Nair killed. You said yes to kill Officer Sada? Where are you headed? Do you realize what you're doing, bro? He has done so much. Didn't we see how much he's done, Bhawrya? Why do you want to kill him? He doesn't understand! - He is such a good person. - He took care of you like a brother... ...and you want to kill him? Like a brother.. Don Malbari is my brother now. I will kill Sada or any Policeman... ...on his orders. That is wrong, bro! Yes. - Why aren't you answering my calls? - I just did! Anyway, let's get down to business. It's Rangya, isn't it? Tell Rangya you don't want to do the job. Tell him Maruti said... - ...we don't want to do the job. - Shut up! Tell him Maruti said we won't do it, bro! - Quiet. Sada Nair will attend the immersion. You must kill him there. Look, public and family will be over there. The shootout can't take place there. Don Malbari said to do it. - Are you listening? - He leaves his home all by himself... ...in the morning. I will kill him there. These are Don Malbari's orders. What have I not done for Malbari?! - What have I not done? - He has to be killed there! - Do you understand? - Don't talk like an idiot! He can't be killed at the function! Okay, I will do it if you don't. I will not do it and I won't let you do it either! Don has said that he has to be shot and that's that! You! - Bro, you.. - Do not speak! (Sanskrit chant) (Sanskrit Chant) The Lord of Lords. All hail Lord Ganapati. All hai. All hail. Hail, Ganpati Bappa! Hail, Ganpati Bappa! - Yes. - All hail Lord Ganapati. Why isn't he answering the call? The scum. (Sanskrit song) (Sanskrit song) Get up! - What's the matter, bro? - Rangya has sent shooters over there. Get going! (Sanskrit song) - Make the call! Call him! - Where are you? - What is it, Maruti? All hail Lord Ganapati. All hail Lord Ganapati. All hail Lord Ganapati. (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) Out of the way! (Sanskrit Chant) (Sanskrit Chant) - All hail Lord Rama. - Stay at the back, Officer I'll deal with them! All hail. Ghulam. Rangya, Malbari and all the others are against you, Ghulam. Either they will kill you... ...or you will kill them. I am telling you for the last time. Surrender yourself. 'On the one hand Ghulam's path to the gang was blocked forever...' '...since he went against them.' Sir, it's confirmed news. No more of Rangya's men was killed. I am certain Ghulam killed him. Really? Let them fight each other and die. It will reduce our workload. We will kill the remaining. 'Harya was fighting death in the Hospital.' 'Circumstances were inducing Ghulam into doing stupid things...' '...and he was under duress to perform.' I need money. - Did you hear me? - You will get it. Hello. Yes, tell me. Hey.. Hey. Hurry. Let's go, bro. Reporter RD was shot to death in broad daylight today which has caused turmoil in the world of journalism. It is believed that he was going to expose a smuggling nexus, which is why he was murdered. The Police hasn't made it clear as yet who is behind this murder. This is Mamta Sharma with Cameraman Sandeep, Star news. Don't look down. Look up. Up. Over here. It is very strong. It runs ten times faster. This is the reporter's bag. You turned out to be faster than everything I'd heard about you. I deal in antiques. Do you know what antiques are? Ancient things. They are very valuable. You won't understand much in too much detail. Let me explain is simply. I smuggle antiques... ...out of 12 countries... ...and this reporter... ...was going to expose me. It's like this. In business speed breakers have to be removed else the business doesn't take off. Look, I am not interested in your business. Just tell me what my role will be. You will help with everything required to establish the business. What kind of help? I have money. Black money. Only cash. I will require a place to set up an antique shop over here. I need a shop and a showroom. You will make all the arrangements. But in cash. I will use the showroom to find my scapegoats to sell my main objects. Where are you? I want to talk to you. I thought of you as a younger brother. Where are you? - Tell me. - Stop pretending to be my brother. I left everything behind to follow you like a dog and you dared to screw me! Stop that abusive language. I have called you with honest intent. Hey, Malbari! Do you think I'm an idiot? Don't use that language! - Be polite when.. - Hang up! Cool down, man! Cool down! There's nothing to look forward to in a gangster's life. - Shootouts and so on. - Thank you. You helped me when in need but don't poke your nose in my business. I just want my money and I will kill anyone you want me to kill. "One step forward." "Two steps back." We got both the shops at Kabutarkhana, bro. "Choking." "Choking." Boss, he is done for. "Lucky, Lucky." What's up? The whole floor is required for that, bro. - Greetings. - Greetings. I'm sorry you had to come all the way here for me, sir. Here. Look, I did everything I could on my part. The shop owner refused to sell his shop. He will do the job, sir. There is still a lot of work for you to do. Did you understand that? It will be done. She doesn't want to talk to you, Ghulam. Give her the phone! Tell her it's my call! Hurry up! - What? - Pinky, Ghulam on the phone. At least talk to him. Are you a storm? Are you the day of doom? There are more such articles that have to be brought into Mumbai by sea. "It is a silent statement." "Life is helpless." "Want to get to the destination." This is some foreign currency. I want to convert it into Indian rupees. It will be done by evening. Yes, junior. Ghulam sent some money. I will not accept any money. How far has the inquiry progressed in that case? The inquiry is ongoing, sir. I'll report shortly. I don't know what you do. Bro. Bhawrya is dead, bro. Man. Let me tell you something emotionally. Go away from India. Only a Policeman's bullet or a gangster's bullet is in your future. Why do you want to ruin your life? Go to Singapore. Go and live over there. Your girlfriend, Maruti and you. I will secure passports under new names for the three of you within ten days. Go there. I will arrange everything. Don't stress over it. All will be well. Cheers, bro. Brother Anthony is right. The only end in our line of work is a bullet. Either a Policeman will shoot us or someone else will. I don't want to live here. Don't stay here if you don't want to stay. Brother Anthony is getting hold of passports for us. - What? - We will go to Singapore. Pinky, you and I will go to Singapore. We'll have a business over there. We'll have everything. We will build a life over there. I will go with you anywhere you go. Once we leave this country all my records will be wiped out. Everything from the past will be expunged. But let me tell you something. If you go up I shall go there before you, bro. - Happy! - I too am very happy! Happy! Him too. Come in, Ghulam. Greetings. I was waiting to have lunch with you. Have some food. No, sir. I've eaten. Here's your mobile. And passports for three people. - Prepare to leave, let me know... - Show me. ...and I'll book the tickets. From here to Chennai and from Chennai.. Hey, bro. Your photo is in full color but my color photo looks black and white. Ghulam, this has to be delivered at Kabutarkhana. Deliver it. And the keys are with Abdul. -Take the car. -What time does it have to be delivered? Between 7:00-7:30. - Go. - Bye. Let's go. Thank you for everything. Don't be. Prepare to leave. - Goodbye! - Yes, I shall give you the name. Yes. That. - I don't have time. - Hey, Pinky! I am alive. You don't have to feign concern for me. Stop babbling away. This is Maruti. - Just listen to me without a sound. - What do you have to say? Yes! Our junior is lucky for everyone. Pack your bags now as we are going to Singapore. I am not going anywhere. Not with anybody. Silly girl! We have wound up all our businesses here. We are going to live the white collar life henceforth. Even bro has turned over a new leaf. Hah! Turned over a new leaf! We'll be going by flight. Look at this. That passports are ready. I beg of you, Maruti. I don't want to go. Listen. Listen to me. We are.. - I don't want to listen to you. - Pinky. It is me. Look, don't hang up on me. I don't want to talk to you. Hang up! Listen. Listen. I will stop all the crooked jobs hereafter. We will live just the way you want us to live. I gave you many chances. You won't mend your ways. I know it! Please just leave me to my devices. Don't hang up. Please. I swear on my child when I tell you this. I will become the Ghulam that you wanted. Just give me one chance. I feel lost without you. I cannot go on without you. I just want to eat food cooked by you. I'm coming. Great going, bro! Life is good! Thank you, God! I love you! I swear on my mother I will never do anything illegal again. I don't see anyone, bro. Looks like that person isn't here. - Let me go take a look. - Stay here. Okay, bro. I have run out of cigarettes. Hello. That's where we are. We are waiting at Kabutarkhana. It is so crowded here that there's no place to park the car. Get the car out of here, sir. This spot is for my boss's car. I told you to move the car from here! Hey. You dare to intimidate me! You are intimidating me! Stay there! Why are you frazzled, brother Anthony. The parcel is safe and sound. 'If you go up..' 'I shall go there before you, bro.' 'Ghulam, this has to be delivered at Kabutarkhana.' 'Riyaz is in Mumbai. I hear he's going to do something very big.' 'The job is a little dicey. That's why you are required.' 'It is very strong.' 'He was going to expose me.' 'I have studied this area thoroughly.' 'We got both the shops at Kabutarkhana, bro.' This shop is done. 'There are more such articles..' '..that have to be brought into Mumbai by sea.' at Andheri bazaar, Mumbai stock exchange and Kabutarkhaana while more than 170 people have been injured. The Police arrested sharp shooter Ghulam at the crime scene. This is the same Ghulam who was encounter specialist Sada Nair's informant. Following these blasts in Mumbai the Government has issued orders of high level enquiry and the Police has started investigations. During preliminary inquiries it has been learned that Riyaz had reporter RD murdered with the help of Ghulam because RD came to know that Riyaz is in Mumbai and this could prove risky for his mission. A watchman at Kabutarkhaana who was and eyewitness to crime said that the blast took place in the same vehicle that Ghulam arrived in. Ghulam's accomplice Maruti has been killed. Ghulam has named Shabana.. 'I swear on my child when I tell you this.' 'I will become the Ghulam that you wanted.' Pinky? What's the matter, Pinky? Ahhhhhh! 'After the 3 blasts that took place in Mumbai yesterday Pakistani terrorist Riyaz and his accomplices were at Cooper house looking for a way to escape by holding some innocent families hostage.' It is God's will. Did you hear that? Did you hear those screams and that music? It is God's will. Two old women, three youth and three young children. Two are gone but one is alive. All of them members of the same family. Their only fault was that they came in the way of our mission. Did you see... ...the effect of raising one finger? It will be a terrifying sight... ...if I were to raise both hands. The big catastrophe is yet to come. I will turn the entire city into a graveyard. No. No! No! Two minutes. Only two. If you don't clear the path for us to leave then these couple of voices that you hear they will be smothered. Shh. It is God's will. Move! Move! Move! Move! Let him come. Permit me to go up, sir. There is no time to think, sir. He has hostages, Sada. He will kill them if we attack. He will kill them anyway, sir. The scumbag is up there after blasting three bombs. Sada, don't you understand? Let me talk to the Home Minister. Sir, to hell with the Home Minister! What is the Home Minister going to do? I am the one who has to go. He isn't going to go there! Go, go, go! Go! Remove the Police from here or I shall blow away the old man! We have 8 more hostages. I will kill all of them away. Remove the Police! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! 'Taking advantage of the situation Riyaz succeeded in escaping with his accomplices.' - Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! - Sleaze ball! Who else was with you? Who was with you? The Police arrested a man with RDX at Kurla railway station yesterday evening. This person is said to be Abdul. According to the Police this person was the last link in these serial blasts and his target was Gateway of India, Mumbai. 'The corpses and the screams..' '..had rattled Ghulam's psyche.' Yes! I killed them! I killed them! 'Someone who believed in nobody but himself..' '..had started believing in God.' 'Regret had changed Ghulam.' I am not worthy of... ...forgiveness. Give me just one chance, Officer. I will kill Riyaz no matter where he might be. Trust me one last time, Officer. Gulam. Abdul was involved in the blasts with him. He is caught. I will shift him in your cell. Let's see what you can do. You... - Clean it properly. - Leave. Talk! Douchebag! - How can I get to Riyaz? - I won't tell you. I won't tell you. How can I get to Riyaz? Tell me! Setting.... Setting Nepali helped him before. He would know. 'At a Cabinet meeting the Prime Minister took a decision..' to enter and strike the lair of the Chief of the Pakistan terror group just like they conducted the surgical strike in 2016 and the air strike in 2018..' '...to destroy the terror units of Pakistan.' I took Ghulam out of jail and went to meet the Chief of IB. Sir. This is Ghulam. Ghulam. This is Mr. Pandey, IB Officer. You are a criminal, yet I am putting my trust in you and assigning you on this big mission. You will have no path to return from this mission. We have many people who can lay down their lives. We are not sending you there for that purpose. A terrorist comes to Mumbai, carries out a terrorist attack and takes people's lives. Why? Because he does not follow any rules. He has only one aim. Devastation. We have several people in Karachi but despite their best efforts they failed to get to Riyaz. However, after checking your record I felt you could make this mission a success. Even you have to destroy them and there will be no rules for it. All the best! Sir, I want to meet Pinky. Pinky, you always asked me to say this. I shall say it today. I love you. I felt like hugging you and crying since so long. But unfortunately, couldn't do it. For money. I have suffered huge losses. By becoming a shooter. I have killed my own only. Imtiaz. Favdya. Our child. I killed 180 people. I killed someone's child. I killed someone's father. I killed someone's brother. That scum Riyaz has brainwashed me enough. And I let him fool me every time. Today I swear by you, Pinky. The scum will not wreak such havoc again. I'll finish him wherever he maybe. I need your support, Pinky. You are my life even today. I am going. Who is going to take care of you after I am gone? Hello. Ghulam? - Yes. We have found Nepali's whereabouts. He is in Daman. At Dhanshu Lodge. I'll send you the address. We are leaving for Gujarat too. Who is it? - Stop. - Move. Brother.... What the hell are you doing to me? I did it for money. What do you want? Tell me. Riyaz. Pakistan. Pakistan. - He fled to Pakistan. - When? When did he go? - After he left Laos. - How did he go? How did he go? By sea. I got him on a ship. Shabana. She is going to Pakistan tonight with two native boys. I want those three. Shabana is not what you think. She is an extremist. She is one of Riyaz's trusted people. She would rather die than take you to Pakistan. And you will not be able to get to Riyaz if you kill Shabnam. How are they going to get to Pakistan? One of my men Janardhan Kohli. She will call me in a couple of days. I will send my man who helped Riyaz get to Pakistan. He must have arranged a boat for Pakistan from here. Yes. All is well. Everything is in order. He will take you two there. - Burkha. - Yes. We are at the location. It's 8 o'clock local time. We'll leave soon. - Ashraf. - Hello, sir. You checked all the stuff I told you to get, right? Yes, sir. - Muzaffar, put Shabana on the line. - Yes. We'll meet soon. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come on. Hey, out with it. Or you're going to die. Lay off. Praise the Allah. Darn you. Don't tell them anything for Allah's sake. This is the moment. - You have to prove yourself. - Quiet. Do you remember what Riyaz said? The path you are about to take will lead you to the heaven. Quiet. If you don't put up a fight you'll rot in hell. Release us and you'll see how we wreak havoc in the entire city. We will destroy this city. Allah is with us. Quiet, God's man. You scum. You pig.- Do what you can. What can they do at the most? Kill us, right? But our mission is more important than our lives. Allah is with us. Allah is with us. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. - Praise the Allah. Do you own it? Do you own it? I'll shoot you. I'll see you later, scum. - You have come to wreak havoc? - Praise the Allah. Leave me. I'll kill them. - Praise the Allah. - I want to kill them, sir. I want him alive. - You'll wreak havoc? - Praise the Allah. Let us cut them into pieces right here. Praise the Allah. Give it. Ghulam, we can't kill them. We don't have to kill them. God is with you. He will take you to the heavens. We were told. From Dadar to VT. Road, hotel and railway station. What is the mission? Talk. We don't know. They made us draw this map. And we had to go to Pakistan with it. What else do you know? I know nothing. We were told to survey this location and this photo. They have surveyed the whole of Mumbai. They have a solid plan. He has told us what he knew. He has nothing else to tell us. But why are they surveying? We still don't know. Now this woman and this boy are the only links we have to this question. If you go there in place of this boy then this job can be done. But this woman will not break. Or lead you there. We have made this far. We will reach there too. But let me tell you something. I'll fight till my last breath. This is the only motive of my life. "The God helps those who show courage." Whom were you supposed to deliver this to? "The God helps those who show courage."

The men who came to take him, one of them has been killed. And the second guy has been shot. I can't get through. Now he won't trust anyone. He has switched off his phone. I beg you. Please save me for God's sake. I work with them for money only. I have 12 mouths to feed. I am the sole breadwinner. If I die all of them will die. Save me. I swear by God. Spare my life. I will help you as much as possible. "Give me strength. Give me strength." "Show me the way. Blessings have the power. " "O Lord, give me the life."

Jallaluddin is undergoing trial for the 26/11 Mumbai bombings since the last three months. And tomorrow is the hearing. He will have to appear before the court. This is the only way of getting to him. Sir, I have intel from Jaffar that Kafa the mastermind of 26/11 bombings will be appearing before the court. Ghulam, that man is very important. He will have Riyaz's whereabouts for sure. Most definitely. He is important. So there will be tight security. Plan well whatever you intend to do. And take care. Only he can lead me to Riyaz. I'll need some other things too. Sir, I need another favour. Jaffar has helped me greatly. I need you to send some money to his family. Will be done. Jallaluddin Ur Kafa. One of Pakistan's biggest God men. The kingpin of terrorism in India's eyes. And the mastermind behind the 26/11 bombings. There is a bomb in your car. Get down quickly or you will blow up. Stop the car. Stop it. Get out of here. There is a bomb in the car. Go far from here. There is bomb in the car. - Run. Run. - There is a bomb in sir's car. Run. Come on. - Go. Go. - Move away from the car. - There is a bomb in sir's car. - Move. Move. Run. Run. Run. You'll regret this. Let me go. You call yourself the mastermind behind 26/11 bombings, right? I gave your people a brutal death in your own country. What happened? Just a court trial. So many people died on your orders. Your country will be destroyed if anything happens to me. I was thinking.... You should not have come for me... If an India gets hold of you... They will not spare you. You managed to kidnap me from that crowd. Your courage is praiseworthy. You are a man. Your country doesn't value real men like you. Our country does. How many pieces should I cut you into? Bombs will go off in every lane of India. - Tell me. - From where do I start? How much do you want? And where do I end? Talk. Where is Riyaz? Let me go. - Talk. Where is Riyaz? - I don't know. - Talk. Talk. Where is Riyaz? Let me go. Cut this rat from the middle. Praise the Lord. Joni Mosque. Seelampur. Riyaz and his family's new address. In this? Tell me. How is your world? Let the tanker through. "God helps those who show courage." Riyaz. You scum. Brother. Someone help. Get inside everyone. Careful. Go there. - Go over there. - Look, he is over there. There. Afreen, open your eyes. Riyaz. Get them inside. My child is dead. Oh Lord. My child. My child. Praise the Allah. - Brother. Brother. - Drop it. Save me. - I will kill her. - Brother... - Drop it. - Brother. Brother. Lay off. Quiet. Do you hear these screams? The tears. Destruction was your mission, right? This is destruction. Look. Feel what the family whose members die goes through. My child. Life has played me. I killed people. For money. I felt... ..no remorse. But the bombings you brought about... Little kids. Old people. Entire families. All I could see was your face. I feel like finishing you right here. You scum. Talk. What is your mission? Who are the people involved? Talk. Shoot me here. Here. Shoot me. Do you understand what Jihad is? You don't. So how will you understand our mission? How will you understand duty? I am fulfilling my duty. What sort of a Muslim are you. What sort of a Muslim are you. You forgot Gujarat? Babri Masjid? The US attacks on Islamic nations. You may forget. But I can't. And India supports the US. Helps it against us. This is Jihad. We will get every Muslim .. ...his right through this struggle. Shut up. What Muslim's right are you demanding? This is not the struggle for the right of Muslims. This is the obstinance of you coward people. There are Muslims in every country. Their families are happy. They have peace and happiness. Everyone has got a bad name because of you, you scum. Now tell me. What is your mission? Tell me. Who are the people involved? Talk or I'll turn your house into a graveyard. - Talk. - On this very day. On 26/11, there were bombings in Mumbai. Just 10 of our insurgents destroyed the entire city. History will repeat itself. There will be bombings today once again. There will be bombings. At any cost. Stop it if you can. It's the Allah's will. No. No. Lay off. Brother. Brother, tell me. Or people will die here. Have mercy for God's sake. Brother, kill us with your hands. We can't bear to see any more dead bodies. Lay off. You are really fond... ..of making sacrifices in the name of religion and Jihad, right? So why someone else? Why not sacrifice your family? I can't bear to see more dead bodies. No. Tell me what your mission is. Tell me what your mission is or everyone will die right here. Talk. These sacrifices are an outcome of your obstinance. I will sacrifice everyone. I will sacrifice everyone. Praise... ...the Lord. It's Allah's will. Look. Try to find. These are the pieces of people who were laughing,smiling, crying, screaming just a little while ago. Look. See this. Is this your sister's hand? And this ear belongs to a child. Look. Do you recognise this ring? Does it belong to your brother? Whose is it? What happened? Are you unable to recognise? You spent your entire life with them. You are unable to recognise their pieces. Those people were also torn to shreds like this. Look. Look. What must have their families gone through? Look. And you want to do more? Come on. The people you torn to shreds... ..were also lying around just like this. Look. And you want more? - Talk. - Talk. Stop it. Stop it. Allah. Stop it. Rashid Masood. He is the real mastermind. Rashid Masood. So what's the mission? Only Rashid Masood knows. Sir, they have planned to do it tonight. We don't have time. Only Riyaz can lead me to him. You have lived up to the trust we showed in you. I might not be able to talk with you hereafter. Yes, sir. But I will keep my phone on anyhow. Sir, I have never believed in the God. But today I need Him. You pray for me that I can kill Rashid before the mission gets executed. I am proud of you, Ghulam. The blessings of millions of Indians are with you. God bless. If this phone switches off or if you feel I am in any sort of danger from them, kill everyone. The Allah will grant you success. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Take me to Rashid Masood. Hurry up. I don't have time. Tell him that your men have caught Ghulam. A firing took place. He was shot in the arm and in the leg. He is wounded. He is begging for his life. He is willing to do anything. And... ...tell him to send a car to fetch us. Tell him. Come on. Hello, Rashid. Riyaz here. (Islamic Chant) (Islamic Chant) Rashid Masood. The biggest terrorist in the eyes of India. Someone who spreads terror. Terrorist. But we are waging this war for our rights. The scums who are against our struggle have no right to live. India's IB has sent you here. To bust our mission. And the patriot you are, you came here. You have caused us a lot of damage. You killed our people. The wound is very deep. Spare my life. You are still standing alive before me. The God is really kind to you for we have kept you alive. There are some important Indian dates. They are remembered in sorrow and joy. Our mission... is to fill India's calendar... ...with dates like 26/11. You trusted Ghulam. We trusted you. Today Mumbai's safety is in your hands. You have complete authority. But there should not be any bombings in Mumbai today. That's it. Sir. We have intel of attacks on Mumbai today. How many of them are they or where are they? No one knows. One of our boys... is delivering this information to us risking his own life in Pakistan. It's the question of the pride of Mumbai police... ...and a million lives. Get this straight. No matter how many of them it is. Or where they come from or how. We will hunt them down. Rehman, you have been entrusted with a huge task. I hope you will taste success. God bless. Abu Hasan. You will ride the bike as you are told. Ghulam will give you directions from here. Babar, today the Indian government and people should realise our might. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. No. No. Don't kill. Wait. Ghulam is smart. He will lead him to a place where there are no people. Look to your left. You will see a ground. Dump the bike in the ground. There should be a smaller gate on the other side. Once you exit through it you'll see the main road. Sir, all three bikers are entering the ground. How did all three of us end up at the same spot, sir? We are being misled. What's happening? How did all three end up at the same ground at the same time? What games are you playing? Give them proper directions to the target. - Hey. Get back. - Leave me. - Get back. - Leave me. Or I will blow his head off. Gun down. Gun down. I will blow his head off. Guns down. Hey, what are you looking at? Kill this traitor. Kill him. Light him up. Why the hell are you barking away? These people can't bear to see you die. They will do what you have taught them, right? You taught them. What if there is an attack on you? You threw some money at them and got them involved in your immoral mission. I am one of you. I have killed innocent people for some money on the orders of people like them. What did I get? My life is hell. But the strength in me today is because of the remorse I feel. I came here from India all alone. I made it this far because of Allah. Because the God is with the righteous. Not with the wrong people. I knew nothing about patriotism. I had no idea. But I understood the importance of my country because of people like you. Do you know think your viciousness is your strength? Is killing innocent people bravery? You call yourself the mastermind, right? You scum. You are powerless. Powerless. This scum... ...tried to bring about bombings. And today he is scared out of his mind when is in the same situation. You people think that Indians are insignificant. You assumed that no one would come here to retaliate. Just a single Indian is enough to retaliate. Thanks a million to Allah as the mission got busted. By sacrificing himself for the country Ghulam has proved that the safety of the country is not the responsibility of the army alone but it is of every Indian. Jai Hind. Jai Bharat. Vande Mataram. All hail Mother India.
