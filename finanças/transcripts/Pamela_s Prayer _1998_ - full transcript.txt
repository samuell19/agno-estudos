(dramatic music) (soft music) - Wayne, I have something to tell you. - What, Sarah? - We're going to have a baby. (soft music) (soft music) (dramatic music) - The baby's asleep. - Good. - Would you like something to eat, son? - No, thanks, ma. Why don't you and dad go home and get some sleep. - Well, we're going to spend the night again and help you with the baby. - You both need your rest been up for days. Pam and I will be fine. - It's no problem for us to stay. - I know, dad, but we'll be fine. Ma, I'll see you in the morning. Dad, I'll be coming back to work tomorrow. (dramatic music) (soft music) (soft music) (telephone ringing) - Afternoon, Christian Film Library. Hey, Harry, how you doing? Doing fine, fine. The convention well, no, I won't be going this year. Well, the doc asked me to take it easy, you know, no traveling. My old tickers slowing down a little bit, Harry. Wayne well I'm not sure. He hasn't decided yet. - I know I need to go. I just don't wanna leave Pamela. - Hey, your mother and I will take care of her. You have nothing to worry about. - I'm not worried, dad. - Well, what is it then, son? - When Pamela was born I made a commitment to the Lord that I'd pray with her every night, so far I've been able to keep that commitment. If I go to the convention, I don't see how I can. - I see. Well, I'll pray with her that won't be a problem. - It's not that, dad. Just that I made the commitment, and I don't wanna break it. - Son, the film convention's very important. You really need to go. - I know, dad. I just wanna do the right thing. - Wait a minute, Wayne I've got an idea. I think I know how you can do both. (soft music) - Master, what is the greatest commandment? Jesus answered and said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God "with all thy heart, with all thy soul "and with all thy mind. "This is the first and great commandment", right? - Right. Daddy, I have Jesus in my heart. - Where's your heart, Pamela? - Right here. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Pamela ♪ Happy birthday to you (family applauding) - [Wayne] Say I prayer and blow out the candles. - What'd you pray for, honey? - Well, now she's not supposed to tell ya that. That's a secret between her and the Lord. - He's right, ma, sorry. What'd you pray for, Pamela? - Dad, (family laughing) I'm not supposed to tell you, but I will. I didn't ask for anything. I just told God how much I loved my grandparents and my father. - Now isn't that nice? - Lord, thank you for our family and for this special day. Continue to guide us and teach us through your word and your Spirit. In your Son's precious name, amen. - Amen, thanks, dad. - You're welcome good night. - Night, dad. - 16 years old. You're becoming a beautiful young woman just like your mother. (soft music) Good night. (students talking loudly) - Hey, why don't you take Mitzy? - [Jerry] Nah, we're just friends. Besides I went with her last year. - You've been out with every Christian girl in this world haven't you, Jerry? (Jerry laughing) - Not quite, Andy. I haven't been out with Pamela Bucklin yet. - Nobody's been out with her. - Nobody? - She's sweet 16 and never been kissed. - Never. - Jerry Clark asked me out for a date today? - What'd you tell him? - I told him I had to ask my father. - Yeah, you know how I feel about dating. - He just wants me to go to the game with him. It's not really a date. He's a good Christian guy, dad probably the best Christian in the whole school. (students talking loudly) - Hey, how you doing? - Hi, Jerry. - So what's the good news we gonna go to the game? - Jerry, I think you're a great guy and everything, but I can't go with you. - Well, why not? - My father won't let me. - What do you mean your father won't let you? I'm not asking you to marry me. I just want you to go to the game. - I know. I'm sorry I can't go. - Look you said I was a great guy. Butter up your dad a little. - I can't. He won't change his mind. - Alright I get it. I'm just not good enough for you. - No, Jerry, that's not it at all. My father won't let me go out with anybody I'm sorry. - You don't have to make any excuses. I get the picture. - Are you crazy? I'd die if he asked me out. I can't believe you said no. - My father won't let me. What else was I supposed to say? - What's wrong with your dad, Pam? He won't let you go out with anybody. My father let's me go out with whoever I want as long as he's a Christian. - Well, he wants me to wait for the Lord to bring the right guy along. - But how are you supposed to know who the right guy is if you never go out with anybody? - How am I supposed to know who the right guy is if I never go out with anybody? - Pamela, who've you been talking to? - Doesn't make sense, dad. I don't see why I can't go out with a guy. Nothing's gonna happen. - I've told you why I don't want you to date. - Dad, I'm wanna get married someday. I don't wanna be single my whole life. - (laughing) You just turned 16. You'll probably be married before any of your girlfriends. - I doubt it. - Look I know it's hard. All your friends are dating and you're not, but it's for your own protection just trust me. - So what kind of a guy does your dad want you to marry? - He wants me to marry a guy who's never kissed a girl. - He what? - He wants me to marry a guy who's never kissed a girl. - You're kidding. - Nope. - Pam, your dad wants you to marry a guy who doesn't exist. - He thinks he does. - So why won't he let you date? - He wants me to remain pure. He doesn't want me to be tempted to kiss anyone until my wedding day. - Wait a minute your dad wants you to wait until your wedding day to kiss a guy, and he wants your husband to wait until his wedding day to kiss a girl. - That's right. Jessica, please don't repeat that to anyone. Everybody thinks I'm weird enough as it is. - Don't worry I won't. Pam, I like your dad and everything but he's living in a dream world. What's his thing about kissing? I've kissed guys before and I feel bad. Kissing's fun you're really missing out. - Jessica's father lets her go out with guys as long as they're Christians. - I wonder what Jessica's husband would say if he knew that? - What do you mean? - Pamela, whenever we come to a point in our lives when we're not sure what to do, we should always look ahead and view things from that perspective. For example, in your case about dating let's look ahead to your wedding day. You'll be getting married to the man you love with all your heart. This is the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with. Now let's go ahead a little further to your wedding night. When you lie down on your wedding bed, what kind of a man do you want your husband to be? Do you wanna man who saved all his love just for you one who never even kissed another woman so he could share that just with you, or do you want a man who's been with other women before one who kissed other women and didn't wait for you? Which one would you prefer? - I prefer the one who waited. - And so would your husband. - Hi, Pam. - Hi, Jerry. - How you doing? - I'm doing okay. - The game's tomorrow night, and I'm still not going with anybody. Did your father change his mind? - No, he didn't sorry. - I'd really like to go with you. Maybe we could meet and sit together just as friends? - I'd like that, Jerry, I really would but I can't. - You know I think it's great and all you respect your father I really do, but you're not a little girl anymore. See ya. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Hi, Pam. - Hi. - Lots of kids are laughing at me because of your old fashioned ways. - There's nothing old fashioned about purity. - You can't show me one verse in the bible where it says it's wrong to date. - Pamela, what's gotten into you? - Nothing it's just I'm not a little girl anymore. - I know that, but I'm still your father and I'm responsible for your well being. - You don't trust me that's what it is. You don't trust me. - I trust you very much. - Then why won't you let me go to the game with Jerry? - Because it's against my better judgment. - But you're making my life miserable, dad. Don't you see that you're making it miserable? - Pamela, Pamela. (door slamming) (soft knocking) Pamela, (soft knocking) Pamela, may I come in it's time to pray? - I've already said my prayers good night. - [Wayne] I've prayed with you every night since the day you were born. - Good night. - Pamela. - Good night. - [Wayne] Dear Lord, we love you. Thank you for this day. Please watch over Pamela. Help me to be the father you want me to be in Jesus' name amen. Good night, Pamela. (dramatic music) (telephone ringing) Christian Film Library this is Wayne. - Hey, dad. - Pamela, hi. - Dad, I'm going to the game a little early tonight so I won't be home for supper. I've got yours ready though it's in the oven. - Alright thanks. Who you going with? - I'm going with Jessica. - Okay, be home on time. - I will, dad, love ya bye. - Bye. (crowd screaming) (cheerleaders cheering) (crowd chanting) (dramatic music) - I'd better go on from here. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, it's just my dad he's a little over protective. You understand? - Yeah. But what's your hurry it's not very late. (tense music) (tense music) - Sorry I'm late. (students talking loudly) - So how was it? - Jessica, why is everybody looking at me? - Probably because the whole school knows about you and Jerry? So what'd you think of kissing? Did you like it? - I didn't kiss him. - That's not what I heard. - What did you hear? - Well, I heard that you and Jerry made out for a while in the living room. - That's not true. Who'd you hear that from? - Well, Mitzy told me and she heard it from Andy and he probably heard it from Jerry. - Jerry's lying. He tried to kiss me but I didn't let him. He didn't even come into my house. - That's not what's going around. - So Jerry told everyone he kissed you. - He didn't, dad, why is he saying that? - Well, first of all maybe the Lord's trying to teach you a lesson. If had obeyed your father, none of this would've happened. - I know. - You also deceived me. You said you were going to the game with Jessica which you did but you met Jerry there. Now Jerry's telling everyone he went out with you which he did but what happened is another story. - I don't know why I did it. All the other girls were going on dates and I wasn't. - Pamela, I would never ever do anything to hurt you. I love you. - I know, dad, and I'm really sorry. I'll never do anything like this again. Please forgive me. - I forgive you. - I love you, dad. - Love you too. Pamela, a kiss is something you shouldn't just give away. It's very special. What does the minister say just after he's pronounced the couple husband and wife? He says, "You may now kiss bride." Please keep out any root of bitterness from springing up in our hearts. Help us not to be angry. We pray for Jerry and ask that you would work in his life. Thank you for what you're teaching us in this situation in Jesus' name amen. - Amen. Thanks, dad. - Your welcome. - Dad, I never thought Jerry would spread a lie about me. - People lie to cover themselves. Maybe Jerry did some bragging to his buddies, and now he has to live up to it by lying I don't know. - What can I do everybody thinks I did something I didn't? - You could transfer to another school. - I wish. - Or you could do what Jesus did. Remember when he stood in front of Pilate and they falsely accused him? He didn't say anything. Jesus didn't defend himself against the lies, and Pilate was amazed. You know why? Because he saw the humble reaction of Christ, and it showed him who was really lying. Well, you could do the same. Don't say anything, don't defend yourself, don't get upset. Just be patient and let the Lord have control of the situation. - [Andy] Hi, Pam. - Hi, Andy. - Pam, I was just wondering if you'd like to go to the game with me this Friday night? - No, I can't thanks anyway. - Are you going out with Jerry again? - No, I'm not going out with Jerry and he didn't... No, I'm not going out with anybody. (dramatic music) - But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep. That ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God. The dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. (students speaking loudly) Do you know what a Christian Film Library is, Fredric? - It's got something to do with Christian films, right? - Right. We distribute films to churches, schools, and other groups interested in spreading the gospel. My father started the library back in 1945 but he just went to be with the Lord last month. Pamela's been coming in after school helping with the book work. Now I need someone back here to help with the films. The job would be every day after school for about three hours. Would that work in your schedule? - Yes, sir that'd be good. - All right. Well, why don't you tell me something about yourself. Pamela says you're new in school. - That's right, sir, we just moved here this summer from Seattle. Let's see I'm a senior, and I became a Christian when I was nine years old. I've been wanting to work in a ministry, and when I saw your sign at school, it looked like a good opportunity. I don't know much about film libraries, but I'm willing to learn. Promise to work real hard and try to do the best job I can. - You think you'd like to work here, Fredric? - Yes, I'd like to give it a try. (soft music) - Ready to watch the film? - Nah, I don't feel like it tonight. - It's a new release just came in today. Where's Jessica tonight? - She's out with her boyfriend. - Should be a great film. Why don't you watch it with me? - No, thanks. - Hi, Jessica, come on in. - Hi, Mr. Bucklin. Is Pam home? - Yeah, she's up in her room. - Thanks. - Jessica, are you alright? - Yeah. (dramatic music) Last night we went out for pizza and then we took a drive. We stopped and parked and then we made out and it was great. (dramatic music) Then he said our relationship had reached a turning point and that if we really loved each other we should... I can't believe it happened. If I would've said no, he would've thought that I didn't love him. I should've known better after what he did to you. I feel so guilty. What am I gonna do? - Dad, I need to talk to you about something. - What is it, Pamela? Pamela. - Something bad happened to Jessica last night. - What happened? Pamela. - She just wanted Jerry to love her dad. She didn't mean for anything to happen. - What are you talking about? - Jessica went out with her boyfriend. (dramatic music) She came to me for help today, but I didn't know what to say. She feels so guilty. She won't forgive herself. What can I tell her? Dad, what can I tell her? - The Pharisees brought a woman caught in the act of adultery to Jesus. They said, "The law of Moses says to stone her. "What do you say?" Jesus knew what they were up to. He said, "He who is without sin "let him cast the first stone." One by one they all left just the woman remained. Jesus said to her, "Did anyone condemn you?" She said, "No one, Lord." He said, "Neither do I", but then he gave her a command. - "Go and sin no more." - Be with Jessica tonight, Lord comfort her, heal her, draw her close to you in Jesus' name amen. - Amen. Thanks, dad. - You're welcome good night. - Night dad. - Pamela, - Yes, dad. - You mentioned a boy's name tonight, Jerry is that Jerry Clark? - Yes, dad. - Good night. - Night. - Our records show it went out on Monday, John. It should've been there the next day. Yes, but I can't run a tracer at 6:00 p.m. on Friday. You needed to call me earlier at least yesterday then I could've gotten another one to you. Not unless you can come down and pick one up. I'm very sorry, John. Right. - What happened Mr. Bucklin? - Faith Community didn't get their film for tonight. They're having a big youth rally that starts at eight. It's about two hours from here. - I know I shipped it out on Monday. - It's not your fault, Fredric. Every once in a while something like this happens. I do whatever I can to go the films there but there's not much I can do about it tonight. It's my mother's birthday. Pamela's cooking a big dinner. In fact I'm late now. - Well, I'm really sorry about the film, sir. - Yeah, I am too. Look do you mind locking up for me? - No, not at all. - I'll be through in about five minutes. - Thanks. Have a good weekend, Fredric. - You too, sir and tell your mother happy birthday for me. - Thank you I will. (soft music) I got a call this morning from the pastor at Faith Community. He said you got the film there just in time. He was very thankful. That's a great thing you did, Fredric but you didn't have to. - I wanted to. - Well, thank you very much. - You're welcome. - I'll be sure to pay you for the extra hours. - No, Mr. Bucklin, that's not why I did it. - I know but I want to. - Thanks. - Pastor said four kids made a profession of faith after seeing the film. - Yeah. (soft music) - Fredric, hi. - Hi, Mr. Bucklin, how are ya? I'm sorry to come over so unexpected, but I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute? Mr. Bucklin, I'd like to start working full time at the library trying to help more with the ministry. I really feel like this is what the Lord wants me to do. I talked it over with my parents, but I know you have the final word. Just wanted to let you know. - Well, this comes as a surprise. I was thinking that with you graduating I'd be losing you at the end of the summer. Now you wanna stay on full time. - If you need time to think about it, pray about it I understand. - Nah, I don't need any time. Starting Monday you're a full time employee. - Really, sir. - Really, sir. - Well, thank you, thank you very much. - Thank you. - There is one other thing. I was going to take a ride over to the rock formations, and if it's okay with you and okay with Pamela I was wondering if she'd like to come along? (soft music) - My grandfather used to bring my dad up here a lot when he was a little boy. He said that this was a good praying spot. He said that God cut a little hole in the rock so you could look up to Heaven. This is where my dad proposed to my mom. - Oh, yeah. - This is also where my mom told my dad she was gonna have a baby, me. - Pretty special place, huh? - Yeah. - I'm really sorry about you mother. - My parents were both in their 30s when they got married. My mom was working at a church, and she was returning a film to the library that's how they met. - Pamela, if it's not too personal how did your mother die? - She died the day I was born from something called amniotic fluid embolism. It's kind of complicated to explain. It's pretty rare. - I'm really sorry. It must've been tough on your dad. You'll both see her in Heaven one day. - Yeah. - Hey, thanks for coming with me today. I hope I didn't put you on the spot back at your house. - No, not at all this has been nice. I've really enjoyed myself. (soft music) (soft music) (soft music) ("O Come All Ye Faithful") (soft knocking) - Fredric, hi. - Hi, Mr. Bucklin, how are you? - Fine, how you doing? - Good thanks. Hey, the house looks good. - Thanks. Pamela's been decorating all afternoon. In fact I think she's upstairs putting some finishing touches on Christmas tree ornaments she made. Pamela, Fredric's here. - [Pamela] Okay, I'll be down in a few minutes. - Do you wanna help decorate tree? - [Fredric] Sure. - You can start with some of these ornaments Pamela made and put them on first. Try to find the best spots. (Fredric chuckles) - Mr. Bucklin, there's something I'd like to ask you. - [Wayne] Sure. - Mr. Bucklin, I'd like to ask you for your permission to marry to Pamela. I love her very much, sir and I know she's the one the Lord has for me. - How do you know that, Fredric? - Well, when I was younger I told the Lord that I wanted to marry the girl that he wanted me to so I promised him that I wouldn't kiss a girl until my wedding day. If I did that if I waited, he'd show me who the right girl was by bringing me someone who did the same thing. I know Pamela's that girl. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good, How are you? - Fine. - Decorations are really nice. - Thanks I'm not quite done yet. I still have a few more things I wanna put up. - Pamela, I was just talking with your father and I love you very much and I want you to be my wife. ("O Come All Ye Faithful") Pamela, will you marry me? - Yes, I'd love to. - Bless you. God bless you. I love you both. - Thanks, dad. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - [Minister] Okay. Okay, now turn and take his arm and pause for just a moment. (minister mumbling) (Pamela laughing) Then slowly proceed out. You two stay here until they get all the way out. Okay, no need to go any further thank you. Very nice. - [Bestman] Hey, is there anything I can do for ya? - Yeah, could you run to the car and get those papers they really signed tonight. - Okay. - Thank you. - How you doing? - Good. I feel like the most blessed man on Earth. - That's how I felt the night before I got married. I had so much joy in my heart I couldn't contain myself. - That's about how I feel now. - I'm very grateful for who you are, Fredric. I love you like a son, and I trust you. I know you'll take very good care of my daughter. - Thank you I will. - You know Sarah and I were married for two years before she died but those two years have carried me the next 22. I just wanna tell ya love your wife with all your heart. Cherish her. You never know when the Lord will call one of you home. - Thank you. - May your presence, Lord, be very real for them all the days of their lives. Always keep them close to you and close to your word. In Jesus' precious name amen. - Amen. Thanks, dad. - You're welcome. - I'm gonna miss you praying for me every night. I love you very, very much. - I love you very, very much. I've got something for you. - It's the cross mom wore on her wedding day. - I was hoping you'd wear it tomorrow. - I will thank you. - Good night. - Night, dad. (soft music) - And as you have both come today in the presence of God All Mighty to commit yourselves one to another and to the glory of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ on this glorious day I say first to you, Fredric do you take Pamela to be your lawful wedded wife to love her, honor her, provide for her and lead her always in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? - I do. - Pamela, do you take Fredric to be your lawful wedded husband to love him, care for him, respect him, and submit to his leadership in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? - I do. - As a sign of your love and faithfulness, would you now exchange the rings you have for one another? (soft music) By the authority of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the laws of the state it gives me great joy to announce that Fredric and Pamela are now husband and wife. What therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder. Fredric, you may now kiss your bride. (soft music) (soft music) (soft music) (telephone ringing) - Hello. - Hi, dad. - Pamela, hello. - I just wanted to give you a quick call. - I'm surprised to hear from you. - Well, I wanted to talk to you for a minute. I knew you'd be going to bed soon. Well, I just wanted to pray with you one more time. - Okay. If it's alright with Fredric. - It is. Dad, this time let me pray. (soft music) - All right. - Are you ready? - Ready. - Dear Lord, thank you so much for my daddy. (soft music) (soft music)
