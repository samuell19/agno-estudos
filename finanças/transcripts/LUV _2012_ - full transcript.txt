So we in business? - Look, i'ma tell you. You know, it's hard getting these young boys to buy from somebody they ain't familiar with. Enoch is your only chance of getting any money tonight. - Man, i don't fuck with yo like that. He probably know who i am. So i don't even know why you trying to put me in that. - What's you beefin' with enoch for, unc? - His little brother, man, he was always trying to do too much. He tried to move in on some of my corners. Then he got killed. And enoch heard that i did it. - Oh, come on. He don't know who you is. You know, you ain't never crossed paths. - Man, what type of games you trying to play with me? - Now, hold, hold right there now, hold. Now, i ain't trying to play no game. Now, i owe enoch some money. He told me if he can get the shit on discount, he'd wipe the slate. - See that's that bullshit right there, man. - Ain't no bullshit. You taking this shit all wrong. I mean, listen. Enoch is a businessman. All he care about is his scratch, his money. He ain't thinking about you. - I'll sell it for you. I know what's up. - You know enoch? - No, but what i do know... ain't nobody walking up on the corners of park heights without his say-so. He don't know me. - Shit. Boy's got a point. If he can keep the focus on him... then there's a good chance y'all can walk out of there without... without him noticing you. - Yo, you want the money or not? - 40,000. They gonna try to cut you short. Hold tight... for 40,000. - Hit your headlights. - What y'all want with enoch? - We got something for you to count. - Yeah? What about main man right here? Why you doing all the talking? - Nah, he's just my protection. - How y'all know cofield anyway? - Who don't know cofield? He be looking out for me and my fam. - Why y'all dressed for your funeral? Makes enoch uncomfortable. - Nah, we just had to handle some business earlier. - Who enoch talking to then? - Talking to me. I'm the one looking to make the deal. - You look familiar. Where enoch know you from? - Nah, man, i'm from p.g. I be in and out of baltimore. - Throw the bag over, little man. Where you get this kinda weight? Shit gots to be hot. - What's important is if you want it or not. - I need to know the history of what's in the bag... and what trouble it might bring enoch. - Nobody coming to claim that shit, if that's what you mean. - You can get 20 for it. - Come on, man. You could get more for it out here. Fair exchange ain't no robbery. - Yo, i'm sure i know you. Yeah. You used to run off of park heights. - No. No, man. It's your world. - Oh, it's my world. What about the name butta boykins? - I don't know what you talking about. - You know what i'm talking about. Pay attention. Think on it. Black benz. You know it. - Nah, man. - Belvedere. - Yo, we just... - think hard. Look, think harder, nigga. You know what the fuck i'm talking about, don't you? - Oh, yo, we just here to get this paper, yo. - What about a black benz that sped up on belvedere and shot my brother in the middle of the motherfucking street? [Enoch's boys yelling] Huh? You killed my brother? [Overlapping yelling] - Man, shoot that nigga, dog! - Think i ain't see you pull up in that black benz? You killed my brother. - No, man. - Now you gonna come back in my face... huh? - No, man. I'm telling you that ain't me, man. I been telling you. [Groaning] - You should've left baltimore, vincent. - His name is mike woods! - Shut up! - His name is mike... - check my wallet! Check it. - Don't fuckin' move! Shit. Get 'em up. Somebody killed my brother. On the strength of cofield, you get 25,000. Give the little man his money. Yo. Next time, a lot smoother, all right? - All right. [Door alarm pinging] - What up, shorty? - Don't. What are you doing? - What you mean, what i'm doing? I'm here. - How could you do this to me? - How you feeling? I missed you. - Why? Don't. Please don't. Don't... don't do that. - Yo, hold up a second. You okay? - Yeah, i'm fine. Yeah. - Come on, we gotta go. We got dinner plans. All right. Watch your feet. All right. What up, boy?

Hold it, hold it! Stop the car, wood. Come on, wood. - You really gonna take me to north carolina? We can go now. Can i trust you? - I promise. - All right. [Doorbell] - [Speaking indistinctly] [Bag unzipping] - I smell that old bay. [Chuckling] School bag... real smart, baby. Go ahead. - It looks like y'all have had yourselves a day. Ha ha! Arthur! - Yeah, baby. - Get vincent here a beer. - Sure enough. - Put one in this little hopper's hands too. Welcome home, man. [Fish and arthur chuckling] - You sure are a baltimore man now, woody. - Hey, man, get the rest of 'em and put 'em in, all right? - Mm-hmm. - You enjoy that beer, young man. Make yourself at home. V... let me holla at you. Man, you my older brother, and you still can't crack a crab without making all that mess. Here. You got to cover it. Then you can just... go after, go after, go after it! You know what i'm saying? And the crab stays right there in front of you. - I just don't hit to hit. You know, baby? You know that, baby. That's our life, baby. Yeah. - Where you been, boy? Let me check your pockets. You been walking around my house. I'm just teasing, man. Sit down. - Young barack. What's happening? Down to business. - You ain't never cracked no crab? - Grandma always do it for me. - Boy, you from baltimore and you don't know how to crack no crab? - Take off the legs first. You see some meat on one of 'em you get it off. Eat that, huh? And you check to see if it's male or female. This a male. You see that? - The female, stay away from it if you can, 'cause she's full of shit. - Don't tell that boy that. - You wanna get the dead men out. You don't want none of that mustard either. Unless you wanna eat that shit. See that? That's meat. No, no, no, shorty. You gotta crack your own. - Hell, yeah. You see the scars on my hands? I been cooking live crabs all my life. You best believe them little bitches know when the hot water's coming. - Young woody, he's lying to you. Tell you how he got those scars, is his ex-wife chasing him down south baltimore with a switchblade after his ass. - I'm trying to tell him like it is. A boy deserves that. - We all do. - Remember when vincent was woody's age? - Hmm. - Little punk listened to anything i tell him. - Yeah, that time you told him he had to eat the whole crab shell. - His crazy ass tried to eat it. - Yeah. There was a time your word meant everything to me. - Yeah, well... i been looking out for you since you was his age. - That really worked out. - Come on, vincent, let it go. - I treated you like you were one of my sons. - You were always talking that family shit. You don't really look out for nobody but you. - Hmm. This paranoia's eating at you like cancer. I ain't your enemy, son. - Who my motherfuckin' enemy? 'Cause jamison ain't had no motherfuckin' money. So who my enemy? - I'd have killed you a long time ago... if i really wanted to. - Hey, come on. It's not supposed to go down like that now, okay? - Wood, get outta here. - You don't think i remember all those side deals you tried to do? - I ain't never stole from you, man. I ain't no thief. - For years, i looked the other way. You think i'm stupid, v? You don't think i know what's going down... on my streets? - Nigga, those streets would've ate your old ass up if i wasn't out there for you. Them streets woulda ate your ass alive! I put that work in. I did that shit, man. And you know it. I did it. So you're gonna leave me out here hanging... your son? Your son. Family. All that bullshit you be talking to everybody.

About a few years younger than you. Tell you, every night i go home... watch 'em in their bed, sleep. Only god keep 'em safe. - Can't protect 'em from bad people. - [Sighs] Yeah, i know.
