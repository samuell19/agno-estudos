-Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. Sparring people like Mo Wilson, Melvin Foster. Couldn't nobody knock me out. The only thing knocked me out was selling drugs... living my crazy world. And I regret it to this day, and that's why it's my job to keep the little guys in this gym so they won't end up like me. If it wasn't for this gym right here, it'd be more -- more young men dead out there. - You ugly! - Hey, hey, hey. Wop Wop. Wop Wop. Wop Wop. Take you to McDonald's, get you a Big Mac, okay? You better act like it, then. - Hello. - How you doing? - Hey, babe. - Give me a kiss. - Hey, I'm gonna keep him with me. I'll bring him back when I go to work. I'll drop him off. - Oh, you're gonna bring him to me? Okay. - If you leave before I get out of the gym, just come get him. - Okay. Give me a kiss. I love you. -All right. - How was school? - Good. - It's time to go underground, y'all. It's time to get ready for these qualifiers, all right? I don't want to hear nothing. We about to get dead-ass serious around here, man. Peanut, your first time losing. How does it feel? You don't want to experience that feeling no more, do you? Me, I don't like losing. I don't like losing, all right? This is the first time we went to the nationals and we came back empty-handed. This has never happened to us. I'm feeling a certain way right now. That's why we back in here Monday morning. I don't want to hear no crying, no complaining. We got that understanding? All right. Let's get to work. All right. Y'all ready? Come on, y'all. Let's spread out. I don't want no loafing. - Y'all got to come out. - Less than a month to the J.O.s, y'all.

Good work, y'all! - My name is Ragahleak "Peanut" Bartee, and I got "Peanut" by my coach. He said I had a peanut head, so that's why my name is Peanut. Coach Walt is a father figure, but also as a father figure, he's strict. He want everything to be on top. Coach Walt and Quincey, they're like family. The whole Lyfe Style Gym, they're like family, basically. - My name is Quincey Williams, and I'm 13 years old, and they call me "Body Snatcher." We was fighting in the ring, and so... I had got punished by both of them, so I started crying, and Coach Walt put me out the gym. Two, three days later, I came back and I told him that I wasn't gonna cry or nothing no more. And after that, it's been successful with me. - This gym, Ferebee Hope Recreation Center, it's not the best gym. We use what we can use. The neighborhood, it's not very good. There's a lot of drama outside, so the gym, for us, is our safe haven. -One time I was at the pool. I was just swimming, and out of nowhere, there was a shootout, and I had to get out the pool and run inside of the recreation center. - I see the whole Lyfe Style team -- me, Peanut, Quincey, everybody -- fighting one day on the MGM Grand, all of us headlining. All of us -- Well, I'm gonna be headlining, but all of them gonna be on undercard, all of us fighting that night, matching uniform, matching sweatsuits. We'll be undefeated. All of us gonna be world champions in different weight classes. Our future's bright. - I see myself in, like, the next five, four years, you know, having my first professional fight. Then after that, I'll get my mom out of these little apartments and houses and take her somewhere better. And then -- No, after all, all, all, all that, probably have my first child. Then... I think that's it, 'cause I ain't having too much kids. -No, that not nice. - I fight to get my mom and my sister and my siblings out of where we at now. And, you know, that's why I push so hard. - That's so sweet. That's sweet. I told you that before, when you said that before. I told you that was sweet. - That's so sweet. - It makes me feel like a proud mother, him saying that he want to look out for me as much as I look out for him. -That's so sweet. - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm proud that he's doing so well in it and he loves it, the sport. But as a mom, I'm also like, "My baby might get hurt." So that's the only mixed emotions I have about it. - It's a really tough neighborhood to grow up in. We just had a homicide this morning. Right here in Ward 8, we have 82% single-parent households, ran predominantly by African-American women and grandmothers and aunts. So we pretty much have been missing the presence of a black man. So I think that the coaches is pivotal to what we need. They've been through the challenges, the incarceration, coming back through getting in trouble, coming back, and I think the kids need to see, you know, that you don't have to go down that same path, and that's what we provide. You know, we got a new president, Donald Trump, and we don't know what's gonna happen down the line with this new administration. They sit right across the street. So I think we have to incentivize those by paying them, you know? People get paid to do all types of stuff in D.C. Why not pay people to be mentors, to be activists for young people and for the community to do the work they love to do? We have a lot of money we're just giving out to big business and developers -- billions of dollars. So we have to incentivize those who are really doing the sweat equity and the human-capital development. - I'd love to be coaching full time, man. If I keep on doing this construction, I ain't gonna be no good to the kids. 'Cause eventually, my back gonna go all the way out. It's crazy. I'd rather be working at nighttime. 'Cause the daytime, they be killing me, and I got that slipped disc in my back. I be on the machines. The machines get to rocking. Hi. This is Walter Manigan calling again for the D.C. Department of Recs to check on the status of my application to go from youth volunteer to full-time employee. I'm hoping to one day... ...build this empire when it come to the Lyfe Style program. I want to make a difference in not just Peanut and Quincey's lives, but I want to make a difference in a lot of kids' lives. - Fighting out of the blue corner, with head trainer Barry Hunter, from Washington, D.C., USA, the number-one-ranked challenger in the world, Lamont "Havoc" Peterson! - When I was coaching with the HeadBangers, I had went to jail. And I looked up and I seen Lamont Peterson fighting on TV, and I kind of felt bad 'cause I knew I wasn't there to share that moment. So I told myself once I get out, that, you know, I'm gonna give this boxing thing my all. - ...to the winner by majority decision... and new light welterweight champion of the world... Lamont "Havoc" Peterson! - Using drugs was my biggest downfall. And that's one of the main reasons why I cannot go back to the streets. I wasn't expecting none of this. I didn't know they was gonna win all them national titles. I didn't know that. I just knew whatever we did, we had to work hard at it. Look at Peanut, man. That's his first nationals right here. Boom. Good brick. - Good jab. - Both sides of the body. Good jab? It was a good jab? Now, come on, Peanut. - ...boxing out of the blue corner... ...Ragahleak Bartee. - Go, blue! Yeah! - There was just something about Peanut when I first seen him. You know what I'm saying? He held up to those expectations, you know? So it all started with me, Peanut, and Quincey. When I first met Peanut and Quincey, there was no male, there was no role model. You know, my father sold drugs, used drugs. He stayed in jail the majority -- I don't remember no time with my father. I don't remember no -- me spending no time with him, no Christmas with him. I don't remember none of that. And it was the same thing with my mother. So to be a part of Quincey and Peanut's life, it means the world to me. This is my heart. This is gonna be the one right here. That's why we give him the name Wop Wop. That's gonna be his two-piece. Wop Wop. That's right, big guy. -Twelve-, thirteen-year-olds might got their guns on them around here. And I'm talking about -- When I say "got it on them," and they will shoot them When I say shoot it, and when they shoot, ain't nobody gonna tell. Nobody. Ain't nobody gonna say nothing. This is where I became... what you call the bad little boy. Lot of murder went down right here. This is where all the -- And you wanted your drugs, you came right here. Everything was here. I was the cause of it. I brung trouble to the neighborhood. My little partner right -- He got killed right here. I believe he was hit, like, at least 20, 30 times leaving my house. So we saw a lot of stuff when we was young. We ain't never get no help for it, though. So people say, well, why we so angry? We saw a lot of killing. - Don't you ever let your mother come to me again telling me how disrespectful you is. 'Cause you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put you in that ring and see what you made of. - For real. - Let Ma get into it. Are you satisfied with the apology or do you want him to get in that ring? - Get in the ring. - Let's go. Get in the ring. If he don't want to put the gloves on, go to his body. Go to his body. - Don't run. - You want to run, but you don't respect your mama. Yeah. Yeah. Whenever you talk to your mother like that, you should never be scared to box no guy. Hey, look at me. I don't even have my mama. I don't even have my mother, young man. And she raised me with no father. I do this to save y'all, man, and you out here acting like this. Once your mother go, she gone. That voice you hear in the morning, "Get up and go to school" -- That's gone. Do you hear me? Get your ass over there. - He didn't want to hit you in your stomach. -Just put him in the ring. -If he did, that would hurt. It would hurt. - ♪ I take the pain - There you go! - ♪ Put it away - ♪ Saving that... for another day ♪ ♪ I got my daughter lookin' at me for advice ♪ - There you go!

I'm gonna be screaming on the side of the ring like I am your mother, your grandmother, your aunt, your uncle, and your cousin, too. Let's go, Peanut! Say "Excuse me." - I'm looking for extremely fast hands, man, from you. Let everybody see you're back. They think that last loss kind of took an affect on you mentally. And I feel like you're back, so now you just got to show the world, all right? Lyfe Style in the house. Let's go, baby. We come to work, baby. We come to work. - Winners here will go on to Charleston, West Virginia, where they'll fight in the national tournament. It's a pretty big deal for these kids. Some of these kids are doing it because they enjoy the sport and they love amateur boxing, but then you've got other kids that aspire to be professionals and turn professional. Most of them are not looking just to be a professional boxer. These guys are wanting to move up the line and become world champions, so there is a lot on the line. Obviously a great pedigree in the amateurs means a lot in the pros. - Everything's speed, okay? Listen. - No toe-to-toe banging at all. - Yeah. Don't loop with your punches. Once you get your money, be gone, okay? All right? Still give me some feints and though, okay? Let's settle this down. Now let's go. Man, time for the dog to come out.

The boxer! - Yes, sir. - Hey! - Hey! - Peanut! A celebrity! - Yes, sir. - Hey! - Look! The champ is here! - Yeah. - Yeah. -Peanut! - Champ. - The champ! - Peanut, you plan on going to college? - Yeah. - How you doing in school, man? - I'm doing okay. - What them grades looking like? -They're okay. - How far you gonna take this boxing thing, Nut? - Taking it far. What you talking about? - Going all the way? - Yeah. - You got a backup plan, though, man. What's the backup plan? - I don't know yet. - You don't know? Fourteen. Got to figure it out, man. You go to college, what you gonna take up? - I don't know. - You're in high school, man. You got to know that. You got to have a plan. I mean, boxing's cool. Got to have something to fall back on just in case that don't cut it. Got to have a plan B, man. You're young, man. Got a lot of time. That's on your side -- time. - You know, just dealing with these kids, man, it just... it just keep me focused, 'cause I know that their dreams, their dreams is based around me, whatever decision I make. So I can't afford to make, like, no bad decisions, not just in my family, my wife, and my kids. I got so many people depending on me. I got friends ain't never coming home, and I lost a lot of friends to the street. You know, I lost -- I lost my grandmother when I first went to jail. I lost my father the second time I went to jail. I lost my mother the third time I went to jail. And when I came home from jail, my oldest son got killed. - I understand. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah, you did real good, though. You always do good. I'm glad you showed me my little gadget, though. 'Cause you probably would've got away with that. Yeah. You all right, baby. - I don't like that! - Oh, boy. You all right. - Yes, you do. You know you love that hair. - No. He don't like hair on him. - I know. I know how he respond to hair. He'll stare at his hand for like an hour. - Almost finished, big guy. - Hold on for one minute. - Lyfe Style, right? Ain't you Lyfe Style? - That Mohawk gonna be all the way... - Okay. Hold still. Don't move. -Don't move, Wop Wop. If you don't move, I'm gonna take you to McDonald's, get you a Big Mac. -You're 9 years old, son. There's no way in the world your father's supposed to be calling me, telling me at 9 years old that he having a problem with you in school. It's no way in the world. And you know what's crazy? 'Cause I look at kids today and I realize how fortunate they are to have, you know, a father figure in their life, which was something that I didn't have. When I was in junior high school, a guy told me -- I had some Chuck Taylors on, and they had holes in them, and he joned on my shoes. And that led me to the streets. You don't have that problem. And I always wonder what my life would be like if I had a father like yours to provide for me, to shelter me, to put food on the table, to guide me, to give me directions, to teach me the morals and principles of life. No telling where I'd have been. I probably would've never had experienced jail. I probably would've never had experienced drugs. Y'all kids today are so blessed. Y'all got all these tennis shoes, TVs on the wall of your own bedroom. I had to kick on the wall before I'd go in the kitchen so the rats can get out of there before I went in there! You could make life so much easier for yourself. Do you understand me? - Yes. - Okay? We love you, man. We only want the best for you, okay? - Mm-hmm. - My man. There you go. One time. Here it comes. Let's go. No pain, no gain. No pain, no gain, baby. No pain, no gain. No pain, no gain, baby. Let's go. Get on that. - I figured out there's too much negative people around here. I just got to keep myself inside before I get in trouble or something bad happens to me. But, like, I got to be real in this situation. A lot of kids around here, like, they mad childish. They do mad, like, dumb things in here, and, like, that's why a lot of kids be like -- They be messed up in the streets 'cause they, like, they do dumb stuff in here. Like, they just do stuff just to do it. They don't think. And I just sit there like, "It ain't my fault. I'm just here. Y'all just do what y'all want to do. Y'all go over there with that. I'm gonna stay here and just chill and just do me." I'm not about to go off that negative stuff. - You don't want to live like that. You don't want to live like that. Why would you want to sell drugs? Why you want to do that? -I feel like it's the only, like, fast way to get money, like, on your own. - Fast. And it's a fast way to die. There's no win. - Because none of my -- - There's no win. - Yeah, you right. - There's no win. I don't care how you put it. There's no icing to put on that cake. You will die. You will die, young man. I'm right here. I'm right here. 'Cause you know why -- And you know why I said you can talk to me? 'Cause I was you. And guess what. Right now, you might got some rumble. Back in the day, you ain't want to see me. I'd punish you. I'm talking about punish you. If you couldn't body punch -- - I don't even fight. That's the problem. - 'Cause you gonna go get your gun, right? - Yeah. - See? Your gun. Why you got to get your gun? That's the problem we're having to this day. 'Cause people scared to get knocked out. If you gonna get your gun, that means you cold sucka already 'cause you scared -- you scared to take an L. 'Cause you ain't confident in your hands. So guess what. That's what this all about. Man, we right here, man. On Yuma Street, man. Lyfe Style, man. That's what I do, man. I teach that boxing. We got some young 'uns right now that would line up with you and be like -- knock your headgear off. So why don't you come on and give yourself a chance at learning it? That gun gonna get you in trouble, man. That gun don't make you -- That gun don't make you, you know, that man, man. - All right. You got everything you need? - Yeah. - All right. - Bye. - Bye! - Bye. - Say bye-bye. - Bye-bye! - Say "See you later." - See you later! - Bye. - Make sure you pack all your stuff. -All right, baby. -Bye. -Bye-bye. -Bye. - All right! Bye-bye! - Bye! - Bye! - Have fun! Enjoy yourself! - Good luck! All the luck. - We make all these preparations together, me and the kids, leading up to these fights, and they depend on me as a coach. So it's imperative that, you know what I'm saying, that I be there, but on the flip side of that, I'm not able to make it, so it's kind of like a crunch to me and for the kids. Just the other day, Peanut asked me was I gonna be able to make it out of town to West Virginia. And I told him no, and it kind of affected me in a way just telling him that, knowing that I'm not gonna be able to be there for him. - When you're not doing this full time, when you still have to go to work and provide for your family or provide for yourself, it's very hard. If Walt never had to go to work at 5:00 p.m. and come home at 5:00 in the morning or never had to work on a construction site ever again, that would be... that would be awesome. That would be wonderful. That would be so appreciated. That would be... That would be the light. Like, I don't even see my husband sometimes because of our schedules and everything. So it's like... That'd make me feel good. That'd make his son feel good, his daughter. That'd make his family feel good. -You would think that, you know, having someone like myself giving back to the community and trying to make a difference in the kids' life, you would think that, your boss would support you. But that's not the case. That's not the case. - It's crazy that Coach Walt not coming, bro. -Yeah, 'cause of his job. Like, they won't let him off. And I know you're gonna be nervous a little bit 'cause he not there. - I'm gonna be nervous a little bit, but I already dealt with it, so... - Yeah. - ...I'm gonna be used to it. - What's up, man? Hey. Hey, man. -This man brought a pillow, bro. - ♪ She said, "But I live in the hills" ♪ ♪ ...that's just the way I sleep ♪ ♪ Stop that madness, I'm a savage ♪ ♪ In traffic with MAC-11s ♪ Baddest... and she Spanish ♪ I'll fly her to... - I hate poopin' in woods and stuff, 'cause these mountains, you know, these the ones you get -- you get kidnapped in 'cause you're trespassing. They got trip wires everywhere. Like you hunting. And Jason live out here, too. There he go. And they be -- All the raccoons and all. These where the wild animals -- They just let wild animals sleep on top of their roof. They bring them in. They got beds in their backyard. Can't be out here. And nowhere to eat in all these broke, burnt-down towns and stuff. We gonna come out here. They gonna have us -- They gonna have us working for them. But I ain't scared, though. Yes, I am. I'm lying. If I told you I wasn't scared, I'd be lying. - First day. Want to sleep on the bed? -Get work in. -Ring four, bout two. -Oh, yeah, Peanut! Oh, yeah! -Let's go, Peanut. -Put the jab out. There you go. Keep it right there. Back on him! Come on! Get back on him! There you go! - Whoo! - There you go, Peanut! - Gracious. I didn't like that first round. -Come on, Peanut! - All right. There they go. -Stop going back to the corner! One, two, three! Get back on him! -Two, man! -Get back on him! -Come on, man! What you jumping up for? - Come on. Work! Stop holding him! - Come on, Peanut! - Hold your ground! - There you go! - Come on, man. -I told him to eat. Work! - He just swinging just to be swinging, man. Oh, my God. This is terrible. That's terrible. That's terrible. -Ring four, bout two. Your winner, out of the red corner, Ragahleak Bartee. -Was you satisfied with that?! 'Cause I sure ain't satisfied with that, man! I gave you instructions on what I wanted you to do. So listen to me and listen to me clear. You a counterpuncher! I want you to counterpunch! That's not your fight! That was so disgusting, I couldn't even watch it! You are a highly decorated amateur. You want to tie and you gonna fall like that?! I specifically told you before you go in that ring, Peanut, be patient! You got in there and grabbed for three rounds? Who taught you that?! Don't give me that tomorrow, man. - Peanut's fight yesterday, I felt disappointed because I know he can do better than that. Like, he didn't give his all yesterday. I think he was tired and stuff because he didn't really eat the night before he made weight. Having brothers is important to me because before the fights, we dap each other up, we motivate each other. You can say they're my family because they're here for me. My real brother, like, he lives in Florida, I think, or Georgia. And he's not there for me like Twin and Peanut are. I think our relationship is bigger than boxing because we, like, we love each other. But at the same time, we love the sport. - Hi. This is Walter Manigan calling again for the D.C. Department of Rec. Anybody that give up their free time, anybody give up their finances, anybody that sacrifice as much as I sacrifice, I feel like that they deserve it, you know? I deserve my own gym. You know what I'm saying? I done paved the way. This program has been successful. I came out of nowhere with kids from ground zero and won national champion. You got some coaches been coaching for the last 15, 20 years and never won a nationals. You know, my résumé, it speaks for itself. So do I feel like I'm deserving of my own gym? Yeah, sure. I done sacrificed seven years of my life... voluntary seven years of my life, going through situations with my wife about this boxing stuff, and, you know, we ain't always on the same page and we ain't always in agreement when it comes to the -- 'Cause she want her time, too. You know, so we go through our little ups and downs. You know, I sacrifice a lot. And for the most part... I'm patient, 'cause I know God gonna bless me in due time. So, you know, people are all like, "When you gonna get your gym? When you gonna get your..." When God want me to have it, He gonna make sure I have it. Believe that. Believe that. -♪ Uh-huh ♪ Workin' on my rules - Let's go, baby.

You hear me? -They trippin'. - I ain't gonna travel all the way to, like, Scotland just to come here. -♪ I got no time ♪ I got... to prove ♪ I got things to lose ♪ I got life to choose ♪ Let's be honest ♪ Am I really schooled? ♪ Am I still a fool? ♪ If I keep it cool? ♪ I got no signs ♪ Tell me what to do ♪ Show me somethin' new ♪ Show me somethin' true ♪ Let's be honest ♪ Am I... ♪ Am I in the move? ♪ Can I still improve? ♪ I got no time ♪ I got... to prove ♪ I got things to lose ♪ I got life to choose ♪ Let's be honest ♪ Am I really schooled? ♪ Am I still a fool? ♪ If I keep it cool ♪ I got no signs ♪ Tell me what to do ♪ Show me somethin' new ♪ Show me somethin' true ♪ Show me a sign -Quiet down, y'all. Um, I just wanted to bring to y'all attention that I had to go to Quincey's school the other day 'cause of his behavior. He didn't know I was coming. I'll always teach y'all about character, about leadership, about morals, and about principles. And out of everybody, I was totally surprised that it was Quincey. As quiet as he is around here in this gym, he in school making all this noise. That's not a reflection of what I'm teaching. Whenever you do something, it's a reflection of me. I done messed up so much in my life. I got to give back, man. I don't want y'all to see -- I don't want y'all to go though my life experiences. I don't want y'all to have to experience jail. I don't want y'all to have to experience using drugs. That's not what I want for y'all. I spent half of my life in jail. This is the longest I've been on the street. I've been on the street going on seven years. I have never been on the street this long. Y'all keep me strivin'. Y'all keep me pushin'. Y'all motivate me. You know why? I know y'all depending on me. This is where I'm depending on y'all. So I need y'all just as much as y'all need me. I get up every morning. I go to work. I'm tired. For some odd reason, when I get to the gym, I got all the energy in the world because of y'all. I just want to make a difference, man. Peanut, Quincey, uh... I love all y'all. But Peanut and Quincey, I guess 'cause since we've been together so long and me not being the father figure in my own kids' life, and I actually get -- I got to watch y'all grow. See, I stayed in and out of jail. I didn't get to watch my boys grow every day. I watch y'all grow every day, man. That means so much to me, man. It's like -- It's like -- I feel like y'all are my sons for real. I love y'all, man, for -- for real. Y'all don't know how much y'all made a difference in my life. I talked to you this weekend, Peanut. I told you. I know you're getting older. If there's anything you need or I can assist you with, let me know, man. It's a blessing for me, man, to be a part of y'all life. That's a blessing to me, man. God blessed me with y'all. He knew something had to keep me on the right path. -Head up. Head up. Want some water? -Yeah. I fell back, man. I fell back in the cracks. Fell into the cracks, man. So in order for me to get up the next day to go to work, I had to take a Percocet. The first time that I took it -- I had took it, and made me feel like I was on some PCP or something. So I told myself I wasn't gonna take them again, which I started back -- That was the only way I was able to go to work. And gradually, gradually, I started taking more to the point where I was taking 20, 25 Percocets a day. You know, that's almost $2,800 a month. So it led me back to my drug of choice, which is -- which is cocaine. And, you know, that's where I'm at today, struggling with that. Wop Wop was gonna be the one that I get to watch grow every day, and... I seen Wop Wop -- I did see Wop Wop last week. There's no -- There's no communication, you know, on my part. I don't see him, you know? Wop Wop used to be with me every day. Go to the gym every day. You know? That was my little man. I probably see Wop Wop probably -- might be four times a month, man. And the crazy part about it, whenever he see me, he still want to go with me. You know, he don't know what's going on. I fell back, man. I fell back in the cracks. Fell back in the cracks, man. - Why you always act like you got attitude? What's wrong? Lift your head up. Walt is a good man. I know this is a dark -- He's in a dark place right now. Like, if you asked my kid where his father at right now, like... he think he out of town or something like that, like, boxing out of town. How do you explain that to them? Like, I don't try to put a lot of pressure on him, but I do tell him that he play a big part in a lot of people's life. He's been striving for years, like, even before we've met, so this is what I know. This is while he's been wanting his own gym and things like that. And he's like, "Yeah, I'm gonna do this. You know, I'm doing all the right things that I can possibly do as far as everything, you know? My family, my household, the gym, the kids, the community, and it's like it's not happening for me. So when am I gonna get my break?" And I just feel like he came to a point where he felt like that he wasn't gonna get it. Or I don't know if it was taking too long for him or what, but he just... I don't know. He just probably gave up. - Hand me a white V-neck -- a white V-neck T-shirt. Large. Large. - We had some fights on the 14th of this month. No Peanut. No Quincey. Everybody's looking for Peanut and Quincey. We didn't know what to tell them, but, um... I was very frightened. But we knew when Walt wasn't showing up at the gym, we knew something was going on. We knew something wasn't right. So if one coach is falling, I must rescue them. That's -- I guess that's what God saved me for. I just -- I can't watch them go to waste. Coach sick right now. He don't mean to let y'all down. The street got him. You know -- You know what I mean, right? You want to tell me what you think I'm talking about? -Like, drugs and stuff. -Yeah. Selling or using? -Using. -Yeah. - Like, I don't know what to decide. - Your mind spinning, right? - Yeah. Like, I don't know -- - Confused. And it can confuse you. Before you know it, it can make you say, "I quit." 'Cause what it's doing, it can take the fun out of it. You know what I'm saying? I know it seemed strange when we went to the fights this week and nobody see y'all. - Yeah. - I mean, y'all the baddest fighters in there. Everybody worried about y'all, man. Everybody. We miss y'all. And y'all aren't supposed to be at home. Y'all supposed to be in there tapping bodies, man. Something happened to y'all, I'd lose my mind. I don't want to see y'all mess up. 'Cause in Southeast, y'all can easy get off track. And you know what's out there. Look at Coach. We need y'all back, man. I miss gloving y'all up... putting on that body bag. I miss y'all. We're going back home. We going back to Ferebee Hope. -I'll just get back with people I really, like, mess with, to be honest. Get back with Twin. -Y'all need to be in that gym. Can't nobody stop y'all. Can't nobody beat y'all, man. I know there's a lot of people right now... ...watching this saying, "I done the same mistake." Them drugs, selling drugs don't get you nowhere. I love them little kids. -♪ Unh ♪ What if all this was a little lie? ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ What if all my sins never met a god? ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ Would you be prepared? ♪ Would you be surprised? -♪ Oh -♪ Only then would you realize ♪ Oh - Hi, y'all.

I'm a ladies' man. I bring attention everywhere I go. I ain't mess nothing up. I ain't mess nothing up. It ain't on me. - I just feel like we in this, like, small, like -- This is like a... I don't know. Like this is a -- We're in a position right now, like, we're stuck right now, but we got to find a way out right now. And, um, I see myself -- Well, I still see myself, like, in the future, still probably being a champion, the pros, and -- Yeah. Nobody can tell me that. What you talking about? What you laughing for? You ain't saying nothing. What you talking about? -We're so tough out there. And when you're tough, don't nothing stop you. We seen a lot of fighters get tricked in the streets 'cause they think the street is what's really happening. But I tell them it's nothing but a -- It's a dream. Ain't nothing good out there.
