Oh, god! No! ...her name was Nina. She was my best friend in the world. When we... were in our Joan of Arc phase, we used to sit by the hour in the cathedral St. John, waiting to hear heavenly voices. Guess I was crazy even then. Did you hear voices? No. Then I guess you weren't crazy. Go on. I was never happier than those times in the cathedral. The candles everywhere. Wax and incense heavy in the air. The murmur of old women saying prayers. It felt so comfortable. So safe and secure. Let's get to the dinner party that night at the Villa Capri. Nina was there with you, wasn't she? Um, yes. She was spending the night. We had... um... Helped prepare for an important dinner party. Laid the table. Candlesticks with a white lace tablecloth... Best china, all black, trimmed in gold... Red crystal goblets... Can't remember... Can't you? No. The china was very rare... It was all black... And the wine goblets were very, very precious... Red crystal... Oh, please don't make me go on... Six months ago. ...i remember silver candlesticks and black china... Go on. And red goblets... Yes. I can't remember. Three months ago. There were black china plates on a lace tablecloth. Red wine goblets... Two weeks ago. We don't seem to be making much progress, do we? After seven months of seeing you three times a week, I still don't know much more about you than what's written in your file. Normal childhood, normal adolescence, and then judged insane and confined for life for the murder of Nina Chereau. It doesn't make sense. Something is missing. Don't you think I'm insane? No, I don't. Oh, but I killed Nina Chereau! Did you? Oh, god! I don't know. But you can find out. How? By not being a coward anymore. By having the strength and courage to confront what happened that night... I can't. I can't. You can, Ariel. I know you can. Why do you believe in me when I don't even believe in myself? Because I believe in myself. I'm a damned good doctor and I expect you to be a damned good patient. Otherwise, I don't want to play. Okay? What are you doing? You and I are going to play "let's pretend". Let's pretend you are back at the Villa Capri that night. This will be the table... We'll pretend there's a lace tablecloth. These are the plates. These are the goblets. The candles are flick-- that's not right. What? That plate. It's broken. The plate's broken. I was out of the room getting flowers when suddenly I heard a crash and... When I came back inside, Nina was standing by the plate. She was crying. And Suzanne... Suzanne? My mother. She hated growing old and wanted people to think we were sisters, so she made me call her Suzanne. She suddenly appeared. I don't know where she came from. She had a knife... She's standing next to Nina! God, no! No! No! No... oh! Oh, help me! Help me, please! I will, I swear I will. It's time for your next patient, doctor. Thank you. It's a little bit dark in here. Perhaps I should-- leave them. It's how I want them. Of course, doctor. What do you think would happen if you saw your mother again? She doesn't want to have anything to do with me. She's never written me, she's never come to see me. Don't you think that's strange? No, I'm supposed to be crazy. Supposed to be? I think we're making progress after all. I hope my work has been satisfactory. It has been controversial, to say the least. Rarely have my colleagues been so emotional as when discussing your work. Considering most of them were dying of smug complacency, I take credit for reminding them they're alive. Does that include me? I have never had any doubts about your existence, doctor Dumont. I see where you have made a recommendation to the medical committee that Ariel Dubois might be ready for transfer to a private clinic. That's right. You seem to take a particular interest in the case of Ariel Dubois. Yes. Or is it in Ariel Dubois herself? I resent that, doctor. She's not an unattractive woman. And you're still quite inexperienced as a psychiatrist. It's not unknown in such cases that personal feelings affect professional judgment. I have never behaved in anything less than a professional manner towards my patient. Nevertheless, she responds to you more openly than to any other doctor since she's been here. I'm not surprised. I treat her as a human being and not a character in a horror story. She killed a girl in a particularly horrifying way, doctor Bennett. She was brought to us in a straitjacket and remained in one for months, despite massive doses of thorazine. Welcome to the middle ages. Let's invite the aristocracy out to laugh at the lunatics. She was a threat-- not only to others but to herself. We're here to help her, you know. I do know. I sometimes wonder if I'm the only one who does. Now it's my turn to resent you, doctor. Look. All my observations lead to the conclusion that Ariel Dubois is not insane. Traumatized, yes. Emotionally overwrought, yes. But mad, no. She is sick, but I can cure her. And how do you propose doing that? Ariel can only go so far confronting the events on the night of the murder, then she's blocked. That block has something to do with her mother. I propose to bring her mother here and-- that's impossible. You've read the files. The mother chose deliberately to disappear after the murder. She changed her name. She desires to remain anonymous. The only reason I have her address is in case of Ariel's death. She wants nothing to do with her daughter. Exactly why I consider it my duty to my patient to make her change her mind. Yes? I see. Thank you. The medical committee has unanimously rejected your recommendation concerning Ariel Dubois. If you built up false hopes, your patient will be very upset by this news. I suggest you consider ways of rebuilding her confidence. How? By telling her that in the opinion of the so-called experts, she's insane and better learn to live with it? Well, I don't believe that, doctor Dumont. I entered this profession to help people... And I intend to help Ariel Dubois. You should be in bed. I couldn't sleep. I heard the bad news. I'm sorry. Are you? I am. Really. I like you. You know that. Nobody likes me. Don't say that. I like you. I really do. Do you... Like me? What's the matter? You said you liked me, didn't you? Come on, relax... Relax... Oh, no! Can I help you? You want to buy something? Uh, no... I mean, yes. Yes, I do. That's a very, very interesting necklace you have. I'm afraid it's the only thing here not for sale. Of course not. I meant, uh... It's a very interesting design. It is based on the coat-of-arms of the Bathory family. You know the story of Elizabeth Bathory? No, not really. I think I've heard of her. The female counterpart of bluebeard. Killed over 600 young women in her day. I must have her confused with someone else. Probably. On the other hand, there is said to be people 'round today who still worship her memory with weird rituals and ceremonies. I have a book about it here. I think I'd like to buy it. It is rather expensive. 300 francs. That's all right. She was a Hungarian countess in the late middle ages who had an obsession with growing old. She believed that bathing in the blood of young women would keep her eternally young so she would never die. Ah, here it is... The cult of Elizabeth Bathory. There was a case in this town some years ago... Yes? I'd like to speak to madame Dubois, please. You must have the wrong address. There is no one here by that name. Then I will speak to madame lafont. Madame lafont is not here. I'll wait. She's not here, I tell you. I'm not leaving until I see madame Dubois. I tell you, there is no madame Dubois here! Mathias. What is this disturbance? I'm sorry, madame. This man forced his way-- my name is doctor Martin Bennett. I'm a psychiatrist. One of my patients is Ariel Dubois... Your daughter. You must be mistaken. I have no daughter. Mathias... Last night, she escaped from the asylum, and I have reason to believe she's coming here to find you. Leave us, Mathias. Yes, madame. How long have you been Ariel's doctor? For six months. That's time enough to know that she's an extremely dangerous person. Are you afraid of her? Is that why you haven't contacted her in all these years? She's totally insane. No. She is not... In my opinion. That's an opinion that flies in the face of the distinguished medical and legal advisors who put her away. It is. Do you know what she did? I know what happened. You may think so, but believe me, doctor, you can't possibly imagine what really happened. I've read all the reports. And Ariel has been quite frank... Has she? As much as she can without your help. My help? When Ariel talks about the night of Nina Chereau's death-- murder. She gets so far and then there is a block. I believe it involves you. I'd like you to talk to her. I know you can help her. You may be amused, but you may have no choice in the matter. Now that Ariel has escaped, I think she'll be coming to see you herself. Why? Well, you are her mother, madame Dubois. Don't ever call me that! If she's escaped, surely the police are looking for her. They are. But they won't help her. Only you can do that. No. No, I can't. Nobody can. Not even you. She is beyond the help of anybody. Don't you care about her at all? I wish she'd never been born! Mathias. Madame? Show doctor Bennett out. And if he refuses to leave, call the police. Who are you? What are doing in my room? Police. Inspector marais. This is my assistant reverdy. Like you, we are looking for Ariel Dubois. Have you found her? Not yet. Good. You sound relieved. Well, I'm not unhappy that she's not under arrest. Are you saying that if she contacts you, you will not notify the police? She is my patient and needs help... Not handcuffs. In the first place, she is a criminal. She escaped from a state asylum. In my opinion, she should have never been there in the first place. I agree with you, doctor. They should have executed her. Now, if Ariel Dubois would contact you in any way, if you do not inform the police immediately, I will put you under arrest for helping an escaped criminal. Her name was Nina. Her name was Nina. She was my best friend. She was my best friend. She was my best friend. We used to spend hours in the cathedral St. John. We used to spend hours in the cathedral St. John. We used to spend hours in the cathedral St. John. She had a knife... She had a knife. She had a knife! Help me... Help me. Help me... What--? What are you doing here? Thanking god I found you. How did you find me here? I followed the clues in your analysis. You always felt safe and secure here, remember? It's true, I do... No one else could know you'd come to this place. I'm never going back, never. If that's why you're here-- it isn't. I've been trying to help you get out of there, remember? Thank you. It's so wonderful to be free. But you're not really free, Ariel. Oh, I know the police are after me, but if i-- I'm not talking about that. Until you discover what happened the night of Nina's death, you will never be free. Let me get away. No. Why? Because I care for you. I'm your doctor... And your friend. And I so want you to be happy. Happy? How can someone like me be happy? I've seen your mother and I'm convinced she can help us discover the truth. Please see this through. Take my car. If anything happens, you'll have a means of getting away. I don't want to get away now... How do we stay in contact? It's not safe to phone my hotel... Why don't we meet here tomorrow at the same time? Okay. Excuse me, monsieur, but you look like a book lover. What? I have a little shop in the quarter. Collectors usually find something of interest there. No, thank you. A pity. I thought you might find something of value for your girlfriend... Where's your shop? Okay. What's your game? A game, monsieur? I'm not a gambler. I am a businessman. I sell things. Like information? Not if it is more profitable to sell books. For example, um... This one your friend asked about. Let's drop the charade. My "friend" was never in here. But she was, monsieur. We were discussing the blood cult of Elizabeth Bathory. For her I climbed that ladder to get this book... It hurts me when I climb the ladder. I don't forget her. How much? Six... thousand francs. Oh, monsieur! Don't forget your book. Who knows? You might even read it one day. What are you selling this time? Monsieur Albert... This. You expect to get money for a piece of junk like this? It is quite old... And quite rare. Objet d'art. A unique piece of craftsmanship from a vanished age. Madame is well known as a collector. Which is, uh, naturally why I thought of her when... Such a doll came into my hands. Naturally. Everyone knows madame has such style, such taste... Such money. 2,000 francs, madame. Surely not such a great deal for such a beautiful doll... You're sweating, monsieur Albert... You must make yourself comfortable. Thank you, madame... Perhaps 1,800 francs would do. That Jewel you're wearing! Mathias! Mathias! Get him out of here! Pay him anything he wants, but get him out of my sight! But, madame... Doctor Bennett. He says that he has a personal message from a third party. Yes? I'd like to apologize for the way I acted this morning. I should have realized how shocking the news of Ariel's escape would have been for you. It was, uh, a surprise. I saw her today. Did you? She's all right... She sends you her love. Where is she? Safe for the moment. But that's what I need to talk to you about. What do you mean? Since you know her better than I do-- better than anybody-- I need your advice. My advice? Yes. That's right. There are things about that night I don't know and if you told me about them, maybe I'd have a different perspective on Ariel. I'm sure you would. Will you talk to me? Please? All right. The cafe de la chapelle? Do you know where it is? Tomorrow at 3:00? I'll be there. Excuse me, monsieur. These look like fresh flowers. Yes, monsieur. Did you put them there? No, monsieur. Do you know who did? Each Friday, before midday, someone takes the old flowers away and puts fresh ones in their place. I wonder who still remembers Nina Chereau? I do not know, monsieur. Ah. Yesterday, a white citroen. I checked the registration. It's yours. And a blue Renault today. Why? It broke down. I'm having it repaired. Ah. Which garage? I don't remember. You intellectuals-- you really make me sick. A degree, some letters after your name, and you think you're so much smarter than any dumb cop, don't you? I don't know what you're talking about. The murder of poor Nina Chereau. That's what I'm talking about. That was my first job. I was young and inexperienced. And there was a report of violence at the Villa Capri and I was sent there. It looked like the remains of some obscene ceremony. Black plates, burning candles... And blood everywhere... On the floor, the walls. And the body of Nina Chereau... Or what was left of it. She had been sliced open. As if she was a sacrifice... In some sick ritual. I never will forget it... Nor the one who did it. Now, you understand. Well, when I arrest the girl, doctor, I will personally return your car when I come to arrest you. Terrible accident. Sorry I'm late. I saw something horrible. This little girl. She's dead. How sad. At least she'll avoid the horror of growing old. What kind of a woman are you? A cursed one. She's here? Ariel! Ariel, wait! Wait! She tried to kill me! You should've warned me. I couldn't! Why? Why? You knew she was coming! Why didn't you tell me? I took a chance. I thought if you two met, it would all come out in the open and you'd be free! What am I to you? Some experiment? Some stupid game? I hate you! Ariel, don't! What is it, Ariel? When I saw her, I felt everything... Fall away. All I could remember was that... That night and Nina on the floor covered in blood. And Suzanne with a... knife, rubbing blood on her face. She's alive. Who? Elizabeth Bathory. She is alive. You mean Suzanne? Oh, Martin. I don't hate you. I love you. Help, Ariel! Help me! Help! Help me, please! Help me! I'm slip-- I'm slipping! Help! Help me! Help! Help, I'm slipping! Help! I should let you drop. Haul him up. You saved my life. Yes, but now I'm placing you under arrest. For helping a wanted criminal. Come on. You knew that she would come back one day, didn't you? You knew that... Knew that you could never escape from her! That she would never leave you alone-- never! In peace... In peace? Look at you... Ruined! Old! Old before your time and all because of her! That bitch! I hate her! Well, good morning, doctor Bennett. Morning. Did you sleep well? No. Good. I see you're interested in the blood cult of Elizabeth Bathory. Where did you get that? In your hotel room. I have a search warrant. Tell me, doctor. Is that where you get your ideas for treating Ariel Dubois? Of course not. That's just a bunch of mystical mumbo-jumbo. Is it? So, you are free to go now, doctor. I am? Yes. It is not you I want to see in a cage. It is Ariel Dubois. You're wrong about that, inspector. Am I? Yes, you are. But I bet I'm right about something else. Something as a psychiatrist you will be able to confirm beyond a doubt. And what is that? That I'm obsessed with Ariel Dubois... But so are you. And I intend to use your obsession to satisfy my own. Understand? All right. Let him out. Doctor Bennett. Doctor Dumont. What are you doing here? I've come to ask you to return to the asylum with me. I'm afraid I can't do that right now, doctor. I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't afford the bad publicity of one of our staff assisting an escaped inmate to remain at large. Then I offer my resignation as of right now. Doctor Bennett, consider your career. The hell with my career! Doctor. What's happening to you? Ignorance. Stupidity. Narrow-mindedness. The persecution of an innocent woman and the twisted mind of another! That's what's happening to me! Doctor, you need to rest. Come with me, now-- I'm not going anywhere until I prove Ariel's innocence. All right. Today is Friday. Stay the weekend-- what did you say? I said, stay the weekend-- Friday? Today is Friday? Mathias! Mathias! He's not here. Mathias! He's at the cemetery putting fresh flowers on the grave of Nina Chereau. Get out of here! As he does every week. Why is that, madame Dubois? Leave me alone! Because of guilt? Is there something in your past you feel guilty about, madame Dubois? Of should I call you mademoiselle? Since you hate the fact of growing old. No! No! How did Nina die? I don't know! Yes, you do. No! You killed her, didn't you? No! She was mutilated with a knife. No! And you did it because of Elizabeth Bathory... No! Some sick ceremony to worship a dead monster... No! Elizabeth Bathory lives! Of course she does. And she is now 400 years old, kept forever young by bathing in the blood of young virgins... It's true! It's true! You insane monster. Madame! Get out! Get out! I'll go now... But I'll be back. I know where she is. Ariel's voice: Help me... help me. Help me. Ariel! Let's get to the dinner party that night at the Villa Capri... Nina was there with you, wasn't she? Ariel uh, yes, she was spending the night. We had helped prepare for an important dinner party. Laid the table. Candlesticks with white lace tablecloth-- black plates. Burning candles. The best china, all black. Blood everywhere... That I'm obsessed with Ariel Dubois. Red crystal goblets. But so are you. Help me. Help me... help me. Ariel? Albert? Albert? "Villa Capri..." Where is Ariel? Do you know where Ariel is? Where is Ariel? Ariel...? No, Martin. My name is really Elizabeth Bathory... And thanks to you, I shall live again... And kill again. I did murder Nina Chereau, you know. I had to-- I needed her blood to stay young. Just as, through the centuries, I've always needed to kill... To stay young. You are insane. No... I'm immortal. That's not possible. It's true. Hello, my darling. Why didn't you remain where they put you? Because I was growing old. You would have died a natural death. I shall never die. You will. No! Of all my daughters, I loved you the best. Oh, mother... How could you? Doctor Bennett... Your obsession... Has led you to murder. No... You don't understand. You see, Ariel-- Ariel's not Ariel... Where is she? Where did she go? She was just here, inspector, only she's not Ariel. She's someone called Elizabeth Bathory! She's 400 years old. I mean, she was calling herself Elizabeth Bathory-- she couldn't really be, of course. It was Ariel and... She killed her-- her daughter here. I know it sounds crazy! You don't believe me, do you? Come on, doctor. No, it's the truth! I can prove it! I can prove it, just let me find Elizabeth! I mean Ariel! I'm on your side now, inspector! I'm on your side. I didn't do it! Call the wagon! Tell them to bring a straitjacket! No! It's Ariel! It wasn't me! It was Ariel! I'm on your side, inspector, I'm on your side! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me! Okay. Let's go now. Inspector. Let me out of this thing! Come on. I can explain! I'm a doctor. It's in the book. Get the book. Come on. Come on. I'm not crazy! Elizabeth! Elizabeth!
