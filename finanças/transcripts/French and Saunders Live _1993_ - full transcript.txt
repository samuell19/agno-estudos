Thank you. We're French Saunders. And so am I. I'm Jennifer Saunders. And so am I. - I'm Dawn French. - What? I'm Dawn French. No, I'm Dawn French. What's wrong? I'd like to thank our lovely band, Raw Sex. They brought you the culture for this evening. Thank you. From now on we can promise you an hour and a half of good old family fun, we hope. I'd like to say it's lovely doing this show in this beautiful theatre here, but I can't. Can you imagine sharing a dressing room with that for the three weeks? Still looking quite nice this evening. Done yourself up a bit, have you? Thank you. Lost something off here. What, my necklace? What? Off here, here. - My beard! - Yes. Yes, I'm having it completely electronicised off. You know what you should have done, don't you? What? Liposuction. No, she should. You should. Well, you could have all that fat sucked out your bottom, pumped into your cheeks, couldn't you? I've had that done already. Only the other way round. I've had all the fat sucked out of my cheeks and pumped into my bottom. Give me a bit of rumpy pumpy for winter, I thought. Sorry, sorry, where did you get that done? At Janet Street Porter's house, of course. Boy, she got a machine, didn't she? No, she does it with her own lips. It's true, it's true. She leeches herself onto the side of your face, sucks out all the fat and then blows it back up through your body. It's true, it's true. It was disgusting. No, it was lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Well, I've got to stay true, haven't I, Jen? Well, because of my other career. What other career? Everybody knows about my other career. What about Postman, is it? I'm a top covergirl model, as you well know. You're a top model, I'm sorry. Which is why I can only eat two takeaways a day. Good, shut up, ma'am. Get on with the show. No, honestly, otherwise chubbiness goes to my fingers. I cannot bear that. Have you finished? Yes, I think so, yes. Right, on with our show, ladies and gentlemen. In our show this evening, we hope to run the gamut of show business experience, beginning in this half with some variety. Some magic for you, ladies and gentlemen. Music, please, Ken. What? Music, please, Ken. Thank you. In my hand here, I'm holding a one penny coin. Can you all see that there? Well, I can't see it. Can you all see that there in my hand? I take this coin, ladies and gentlemen. Don't just stand there, present me. I take the coin. Thank you. I take the coin. Concentrate. I take the coin and I cover it with a handkerchief. When I remove the handkerchief the penny will disappear. Music There it goes, ladies and gentlemen. The penny has now completely disappeared. It rolled over there. Well I need it for the next one. I need another one. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I now take the very same penny coin and just place it into my pocket here. Coin, this has gone straight into... That one's got stuck in my pants. Have you got another one there? All right. Can you ask that woman there if she's called Sarah Walton? Are you called Sarah Walton? What are you doing? I'm just looking for my friend Sarah Walton. Sarah Walton! No, don't embarrass her, for heaven's sakes! Well, what does she look like? Well, she's about that high. And she's got little pigtails and round national health specs with a big plaster over one eye. When did you last see her? At primary school. Well there, there's one with the glasses. That could be her back there. No, she's only got the one head. That's not her. Just leave it, please, now. Well, I'd be really pissed off if she ever saw this. Just leave it now, please. Can we get on? I've paid for that ticket. They've all paid for their tickets, you know. I know that, you bloody ninquink. They've paid for tickets and they're watching a show. I've paid for one.

Hello, I'm very sorry I'm late. That's all right, hello. Sorry, I'm caught in the traffic. We'll be on air in just a short second. OK, I do enjoy your stay. It's good, I've done a lot of research on you, so we should be OK. Sorry, can you give the students asking a quick level on the... Yes, hello, I'm... You sit back where you're going to be. Right here? Yes. So, my guest today on Record Choice is best known for her work amongst the destitute poor and wounded of war-torn Beirut. She is an expert on childhood diseases and a well-respected figure in the medical field. But despite all this, she still finds time to be a devoted mother of two. She was last year's Woman of the Year. She is Dr. Eleanor Wood. Dr. Eleanor, welcome. Thank you. Before we go for your record choice, I wonder if we can quickly paint a picture of the young Eleanor Woodin, recall some childhood memories for you. You were born in Cornwall, the bonny little daughter of a newsagent, and you excelled in school academically and surprisingly enough at sport. And I rather love this little mental picture I'm painting here of a little Cornish dumpling. Probably goalie at hockey, bouncing about in the goal, lifting everybody's spirits. Because you were, I should imagine, a happy, jolly, sturdy, sort of a person. I was quite shy. I'm thinking, you see, along the lines here of perhaps you were the class clown, because you know, often people who do have physical disadvantages compensate, don't they? They compensate and I'm wondering was it was it dare I say your chunkiness the fact that you were, the fact that you are a fuller figured person did that make you more determined to succeed? No. Maybe being a bulkier person you may not have had boyfriends, probably not, and therefore a lot more time to study but we don't need to dwell there because of course Dr Eleanor is now married, well done, to the lovely Derek Wood. Tell me a little bit about Derek. Is he a tubby or a normal person? You see I rather like this little mental picture I'm painting here of two plumps. Finding consolation, perhaps even a little bit of pleasure, who knows, in each other's arms. Because you see you, you have succeeded, haven't you, where other tubby people have failed. Well, yes, but I never really thought that size was relevant to my work, really, to be honest. Actually not here to talk about your work right at this moment. We're going to move on to that later. I'm in the studio with Dr. Eleanor Wood and we want to talk about the real you, the one the public loves, because you are one of their larger ladies, aren't you? And obviously you're not ashamed of that. You're not ashamed of your chunkiness, of your bounciness, your... ... rotound ample-ness, greater surface area-ness, erm, and you see... Why don't you just say fat? Go on, say, hello, fatty. I think you're running yourself down there a little bit, doctor. - I do, I... - Now go on, say it. I think hello chunky is as far as we could go actually. Alright then, I don't mind being described as chunky and ample and huggable so long as I can describe you as dull, patronising and mentally stagnant. Because the word you're skirting around about me is the word fat and the word I'm skirting around about you I'm afraid is the word stupid. I think I'm having my leg pulled here. No, you're not. - We're not here to talk about me. - No, we're here to talk about me. So please ask me some questions about my work. Let me ask you a few questions about your work now, Dr. Eleanor. Thank you. I'm in the studio with Dr. Eleanor Wood. She's got a marvellous sense of humour, as you can hear. Dr. Eleanor, do get serious for a moment. Yes, please. In war-torn Beirut, obviously, a lot of hardship, a lot of suffering, a lot of troubles there. Food shortages? Perhaps you'd like to paint a picture for us, would you, of how a person like you might cope in that sort of situation? Being the sort of person you obviously are. And what sort of person is that? It's not a piggy. No, no, sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Well, really. We can... Please come back here. We can snip that little mistake there. We can snip that little bit out. We'll move on to the last part of the show now. The final sort of lighthearted moment in the show. Come on, come here. Here we go. I'm in the studio with Dr. Eleanor Wood. Now, I wonder, Dr. Eleanor, if I can ask you before you go, her bleep is going now, she's dying to get out. One little luxury in life that you cannot imagine being without. Now, as listeners will know, this is normally the part in the show where guests take an opportunity to make a little joke, be a bit lighthearted. So I expect Dr. Eleanor's gonna say something like a fridge full of Mars bars, I don't know. The thing I'd like most at the moment is a big sten gun with one end wedged firmly up your arse, you old hag. Marvellous! Marvellous! I'd expect that would be a chocolate stickin' gun in her case, wouldn't it? She's still there laughing about that. A marvellous sense of humour and not an unattractive face. That concludes the programme for today. I've been squidged into the studio with the flabulously large personality that is Dr Eleanor Wood. And before we hear her record choice, time for me just to say I'll be back next week with a more slimline record choice. My guest will be the talented and thankfully petite Jane Asher. Here now is Dr. Wood's choice. You know, I've been around the world and I, I, I can't find my baby at all. She's just getting her face cleaned up. Making herself presentable. A little bit of minor surgery and she'll be right back with us. Actually, it's nice to have this chance to say hello. I'd quite like to take the opportunity, if you don't mind, to ask you a question. Do you mind if I ask you a question? Do you? No. I was just wondering, really, whether or not you like me. No. No. No. The reason I'm saying that is simply because I like you, that's all. No, I do. I like you. I really do like you. No, I mean it. I like you. I really like you. It's just, if anyone wants to be, my best friend, um, you can, because, well, because I need a best friend. Sorry. No, I do need a... I do need a best friend because because I've got a problem and I'd like to be able to talk to them and... Um, I've got a problem I'd like to be able to show with people that love me. So now that we are best friends, I'd like to be able to tell you. You see, the thing is, for some time now, I have... I'm sorry. This takes a lot of courage for me to do this. I've never come out on stage before. If you love me... You'll support me on this, okay? I'm just gonna say it, that's the easiest way to do it. My name is Dawn French, and yes, I admit it, I am a chocoholic! Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Your warmth means a lot to me on this. I'm a slave to chocolate, actually. I went off, what, for about three seconds then? Changed my jacket, and this is what I managed to get through in those three seconds. It's, it's pretty tough. I'm waking up in the mornings with chocolate on my breath. My friends are hiding their kids' Easter eggs from me, which is embarrassing. I'm, I'm melting it down and I'm injecting it. Which is very hard for me. And you must understand it's very difficult for me here tonight in this auditorium because I can smell that there is chocolate in here tonight. Could you put the house lights up for me please? You must understand it's very tough for me to be able to work in a room where there's choc... My God. You are beautiful! Every single one of you. Well, except for that bloke there but... God and everybody's my best friend! I can't believe it! Look, I need your help for this, okay? If you've brought any chocolates, any sweets at all with you here tonight, I need you to show them to me, okay? Dig into your trousers, into your handbags, into your wives. If you've brought any chocolate with you at all, just show it to me. I just need to see it, and then I'll be okay. Now, has anybody got the courage? Yes. Hold that up, please. Hold that up. What is that? What, what make? Dairy Milk! Yes! I knew it, I could smell it from here. I've been there, sister, that is tough, isn't it? Okay, hold that up, I'm gonna help you, girl. You've had the courage, I admire you. Hold that up, hold that up, be proud, okay? I want you to say something after me, okay? I want you to say, Dawn, say it, girl. Good girl. You're halfway there now. Say, Dairy Milk is evil! Say it. We're gonna have to help her, she can't say it ladies and gentlemen. It's tougher than I thought. Everyone's gonna have to help her, are you ready? Dairy Milk is evil, everybody say it! Dairy Milk is evil! Everybody say after me, say Dawn, say it! Dawn! Take it from me now! Ladies and gentlemen, the brothers will be coming amongst you with buckets. If you've got any more for any more, just pass it on to the lady on the end there. Kenneth, you go down there. She's at the end there. There's some mean people up there who've got some, but they're hiding it. Anybody up there, chuck it down if you've got any. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you, that's fine, thank you. Okay, Dwayne, there's a woman there. There's a woman there, third row. Don't shake your head, sister, I know you've got it. Fertile in that woman's trousers and find it, Dwayne. Ken, come back up here. Right there. Toblerone. Very well hidden, sister. A long way to go for you. Nice, yes. Another Toblerone, that's good. I asked you to get the chocolate, not give her an internal. Thank you. Wagon wheel. That's good. The Eau de Clair, sugared almond. Who put the Polo mints in there? You tight gits. I'm gonna save you from this, evil children. I'm gonna put this somewhere so very safe. God bless you. Thank you, 3F, for that lovely disco dancing to the tune of When Will I Be Famous by the band Brothers. That's lovely, and very suitable for this week's assembly theme, which is, If at first you don't succeed, try, try... Right you! Yes you, Mary Gore, and you-know-who-you-are! See me afterwards. Did anyone see the lovely David Attenborough documentary on television last night? In it, there was a tiny butterfly inside a cocoon, wasn't there? In order to be free, the butterfly had to nibble a little hole and push its way out. It took ages, didn't it? But eventually, the tiny butterfly broke free and flew off to be a beautiful, grown-up butterfly. And the moral of that story is, girls, if your holes are too small, just keep on pushing, and then... Right, you. Yes, you, ugly girl, 3C! Don't look at your friends, I'm talking to you! Stand up! Well, I'm glad you stood up. Can you see something about that girl, Miss Barnes? Yes! She is wearing tan tights. There is a rule in this school. Nobody below fifth form is allowed to wear tan tights, and there is a good reason for that rule. Except the staff. Apart from staff, Miss Barnes, yes. - Staff are allowed... - Staff are allowed to wear tan tights. Yes. But no tracksuits, isn't it, for staff? No tracksuits for staff, that's right. Except PE departments. PE departments are allowed to wear tracksuits. Sit down. I'll see you afterwards. Is there anything else before I go on? I have in my hand here a detention list. And it appears to me that this list gets longer every day. These girls will stay behind after school, Sally Higgins' jewelry. Pauline Wild, pregnant again, Pauline, are ya? Lucy Miller and Feliciity O'Brien, sitting on radiators! I will not have that selfish sort of behaviour from girls in this school. We do not spend nearly £100 a year on school heating to warm your nasty bottoms, do we? I do not come around your houses and sit on your radiators, do I? - Yes, you do. - No, I do not, Miss Barnes. You! Yes, you at the back. Grey hair, geography, Miss Griffiths, does it? Shut up, woman. - You did come around... - You shut up as well, Miss Barnes. Hands on head. There has been a lowering of standards in this school, an increase in shameful and shoddy behavior. Just the other night whilst I was cruising around town on my way home from school, not only did I see three manor school girls not wearing regulation school berries, you know who you are, but, as I was passing the bus terminus, I saw four girls entwined around male creatures. I was one of those... I... ... will not have that evil, lascivious, odious, carnal sort of behavior that belongs in the sewer! I do not know what goes on in the horrible stench-built hovels that you all call home, but I will not have it whilst you are in school uniform. And if you think I am wrong, if you think I am unfair, then you can come and see me in my office. We can have a friendly chat. I am an approachable person. That is my job! Who coughed? Who coughed? Right, I will see every single girl in this school in my office after assembly. I'd like to see you all down on your knees begging me for forgiveness. I'd like to whip down your panties and smash some sense into those bottoms of yours. Can I volunteer for that punishment, please? Not again, Miss Barnes. Right. That concludes assembly for today. Before I go, I should like to say there are girls in this school who smell. Your friends will tell you who you are. Carry on, Miss Bonds. School fallout, please. Hi, thanks very much indeed. Um, I've... No, you can move those. Nearly did some work then. It was a terrible mistake. We're going to do something a little bit different now. I think most people have seen this sort of thing before on television or in theatre somewhere. - It's called improvisation. - Yes, and it's very dangerous. I'm just going to explain it first. I think you should warn people about that. What it actually involves is Dawn and I making up a sketch on stage. Can you just wait until I've explained it, please? I'm just warming up. What it actually involves is Dawn and I making up a sketch on stage as we go along. In a minute, I'm going to ask for some help from you. I just want you to shout out at random lots of names of famous women. We'll pick two from the selection. And we will become those women on stage in a situation, like often it's like a park bench or a bus or a supermarket. We've got a lot of space. We'll do a supermarket. Okay, I've explained everything. Right, can you shout out some names and we'll just pick. Just pick. We've got Jerry Hall. Alright, I think we've got two. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. We've done that one. I've got quite two good ones. This one's got a Jerry Hall. Jerry Hall and Sonja. Okay, well I better be Jerry Hall. Painfully obvious, but anyway... And Sonja. Jerry Hall and Sonya, in a supermarket. How are we going to know when to go to character? I'm going to explain that. We go into character when I clap my hands. When I clap my hands, we've begun. Okay? Here we go. - I'm not sure about... - I've done it, I've just done it. - What? - Done it. God, I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. That's good, that's good. Want some of that. Hi. Sorry, now I have to stop there. You threw me there, completely. Why? Well, but I didn't know she did that, you see. - No, she doesn't do that. - Well, what did you do it for? I made it up. Don't just make things up like that. That just ruins it if you just make things up like that, doesn't it? That just makes it stupid if you just make things up like that. - What's the whole point? - We'll do another one now. We're doing so well. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Can you shout out some more names. I'll pick another couple. - My mother! - Your mother. Thora Hird... ... and Elizabeth Taylor. I'd better be Elizabeth Taylor. All right. Thora Hird and Elizabeth Taylor in a supermarket. Here we go. - No, I'm not ready. - I've done it now. You shouldn't do that. You should ask me before you do that. What are you doing? I can't do the glasses and push the trolley, I'm fighting with it. Have a monocle and push it, and push it like this. I like that. Well, I'll have some of that. I know, I know, I know another one. I told you not to do that, didn't I? - No, but Elizabeth Taylor does do that. - She does not do that. - She does. - She does not do that. - You don't even know Elizabeth Taylor. - That's just stupid. - She does that all the time. - That's just stupid. - That's really not fair. - You've got one more chance now. Alright. Who? Frank Bough and Judith Chalmers, now. - Which one am I going to be? - Frank Bough. I know that! Frank Bough, right. You... Wait. Don't do that, I think you're doing that now. I'm not doing anything. I ain't started yet. God! There's a thing there on the stage. Something there. - God, you hurt my ear! - I told you not to do that, didn't I? You cut my ear now. Is there blood on my ear? - That's it. That's finished. - Did you see what she did to my ear? Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen. There's going to be a short break now. It's just for me, so if you can be as quiet as possible at help. Get me a drink! - You really hurt my ear. - Good. I use that ear sometimes too. God, sorry, something I meant to ask you. You know that little silver pendant thing you've got, very, very precious one? With all the pictures of your family. - My little silver precious pendant? - Yes. - Yes, it's in the dressing room. - Nope, it's in the toilet. What is it doing in the toilet? - Pardon? - What is it doing in the toilet? I was trying to steal it, you see. And I put it down the back of my pants and I went to the toilet and pulled my pants down and it fell into the toilet. And I'd already been to the toilet so obviously I wasn't going to put my hand in it. So that's where it is. I see. As long as I know. Are you just going to sit there? - Sorry? - Are you just going to sit there? - Yes. - Don't we normally play a game? All right, if you want to. What game do you want to play? You choose. - What about the clock game? - How does that go? It's the one that goes... All right, I'll play that. Play that. All right, contestant. You have a limited amount of time in which to make a seven-letter word from the following letters. Are you ready, contestant? Here are your letters. Z P Q A Stop, stop, stop. - You missed it. - I don't know. Give me a clue. You want a clue? It's a noun. No, stop the clock. Stop the clock. Well... Zpqa. Pardon? Zpqa. Zpqa? - Is that a real word? - Yes, I believe so. Alright, one nil to you. I don't want to play that one anymore. I want Name That Tune. Alright then, yes, I quite like that one. Contestant, how many will you name that tune in? How many what, Quizmaster? How many duh's will you name that tune in? - I shall name it in one. - Right, here's your duh. Stop, I don't know I don't know. Give me another one. Another duh. I don't know. I don't know. Hand it over to me and see if I know. I know, I think I know stop the clock, I think I know it! Is it Puppet on a String? Is it? I don't know, it was your idea, you were the one that thought of it. Well that's the one I was thinking. Alright then, then one all! Alright then. Shut up. It's one minute of peace. I had a thought the other day. What? Couldn't remember if you'd ever been in the Olympics. You know I was. First woman bobsled, wasn't I? I had a very strange thought the other day. Let me run this past you, see what you think. I've got a feeling, a very strong feeling, that Jackie Kennedy and... Onassis. Pardon? Jackie Onassis. That's right, yes. She married a magnet, didn't she? That's rude. I've got a feeling that Jackie Onassis and Debbie McGee could... Who? Debbie McGee could... Who? Debbie McGee! You know who she is. She's married to Paul Daniels. She works on his show. Are you talking about the lovely, marvellous Debbie McGee? Yes, I am. Well, will you say so? I've got a feeling that Jackie Onassis and the lovely, marvellous Debbie McGee... Thank you. ... could, in fact, be the same person. Think about it. What brings you to that conclusion? Well, it's simple, but it's actually very, very clever. The point is, you never, never see them both together. It's true. It's true. Well, that's true. Well, that's it, then, isn't it? That's it, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, French & Saunders. Bring them back onto the stage, the fabulous French & Saunders. I'll tell you who else worries me, is that little one in The Crankies, I've never understood that. - Was that the finale? - That was the finale! Not supposed to come yet, is it? Ken, Dwayne. - What? - What happened there? Bugger off, we're finished. Go on. It's not supposed to come yet, is it, Ken? No. Yes, sorry. We've been waiting there, and we were waiting for your cue, because when you say, "That's it then", I press the button. And we do all this? Not till the end of the show, you stupid old sod. - It is the end of the show. - It's not. We've got another five hours yet, Ken. I've got to clear this up now. Get off. Go on. You can move these chairs back. I don't know what the fucking hell's going on here. No. Ken's ruined it for everyone now, hasn't he? Just shut up and get on with something. Can you think of something to get on with when I do this? Get on with what? Don't just stand there and watch me. Think of something to get on with. I haven't got anything. Tell a joke. That's what I pay you for. - I don't know any joke. - Think of one. Well, thanks very much, Jen. We're certainly spic and span here now, aren't we? The elephant joke, right. There's a mouse and an elephant, and they're walking through the jungle, and the mouse falls into a swamp. So the elephant says, don't worry, you're my friend. I'm going to help you out. So the elephant unfurls his very large willy, and then... It's a bit naughty already, sorry. And the mouse gets on to the big willy and scampers off to safety, you see. And the mouse says to the elephant, thanks very much. And the elephant goes, that's all right, you're my friend. So they're walking a little bit further along in the jungle and the elephant falls into a swamp, as you do. And the mouse says... I don't think I can help you out there, mate, sorry. And the elephant says, for goodness sake, hurry up, go and get your Porsche. I know it's unlikely, it's a joke. And so the mouse goes and gets his Porsche, brings it to the side of the swamp, the elephant wraps his trunk round the exhaust pipe and the mouse pulls him out to safety. And the elephant says to the mouse, thank you very much, and the mouse says, that's all right, you're my friend. Now the moral of that story is, if you've got a Porsche, you don't need a big willy. I love that joke. If you've got a Porsche, you don't need a big willy. If you've got a Porsche, you don't need a big willy. Of course, you do need a big willy, but there you go. Yes I know one more joke. A man and a woman are walking along a street and the woman looks into a shop window and she says, I love that lovely red dress that I really like there. And the man picks up a brick, throws it through the shop window, goes with the dress. She says thank you very much. He says, that's all right, you're my friend. And they're walking away there, they're logging down the street. And she sees a kettle, a kettle in a shop window that she quite likes. And she goes, I love that kettle there that I really quite like. And the man picks up a brick, throws it to the shop and he goes, there's a kettle. She goes, thank you very much. He says, that's all right. You're my friend. They're walking... They're walking a little bit... Stop it. I mean it. Nobody's laughing at you. Right... They are walking a little bit further along and... Right I've had enough of it! You shut up! You're thinking about heckling me, aren't you? Yes, there's one in every audience that's gonna ruin it for everybody else! Well I'll deal with you, madam. Don't you worry about that! This is my book of heckle put downs. Jimmy Tarbuck wrote these! They work! All right, how dare you? There's one here that'll sort you out. Yes, number three. Yes, number... yes, number five. You there, madam. I see you went to the hairdressers today. It was obviously closed. That's shut you up, hasn't it? And that you can shut up that bloke behind, there. Number two, are those sideburns on the side of your face, sir? Or are you simply on the telephone? And you can shut up up there, too. That man there. Is that a tie you're wearing, sir? Or have you simply been sick? Right, I'm coming into the audience. I refuse to have this sort of behaviour at my show. Yes, it's not so funny now, is it? She's looking a bit frightened now, aren't you? Yes, well, shut up. Where are you from? Where are you from? London. London. London. Well, it just so happens I know something really cutting and clever to say about London. London, London... Yes. Apparently, in London... Anyway, in... In London, apparently, there's a library. I can do anything. I can sit on this bloke if I want to. Sit on him. Dear, his cop's gone right up a jacksie. It's not funny, it's not clever, and it's not hygienic, that sort of thing, is it? It's just disgusting, isn't it? - What is it? - It's disgusting. I think you'd better go off and we'll discuss it. Go on. I'm sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen, I've got to go off to discuss this briefly. Are the boys there? Can they come on for a second? Are the boys there? Yes? Fabulous. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, briefly, back onto your stage, the fabulous Raw Sex! Are they there? Are they there? Wake up, Ken. What do you have here, mate? Shit! Dwayne. We on? Dwayne, have you been drinking? Completely pissed off me head, mate. I'm sorry... I'm sorry about this. We'd like to... We'd like to continue with one of Dwayne's favorite tunes from our repertoire. - I thought we'd finished. - No. This is a tune featuring the drums. It's our tribute to some of the great drummers of the world. Yeah. Drummers like Buddy Rich, Ringo Starr, Keith Moon. Okay, cheers up there. And of course the immortal Sandy Nelson. We'd like to continue with Sandy's only hit, really. I'm a bit pissed, do you mind me telling you that? I'm talking of Let There Be Drums, thank you. I've had a drink, all right? Dwayne, let there be drums. He is the human metronome. - Come back in now. - That's the solo. I can't keep this up, I'm going to be really sick. I'm going to throw up in a minute. Please come back in. Two, three. Jim, have you got a soldering iron? I think this plug's broken. Come back! Don't leave! It won't be the same. Dwayne, this isn't working either. - Just sing it. - That's stupid. Please. Dwayne, let there be drums. Fuck that. Do the ending. I had to switch, you don't switch at all. Jim. Jim, those roadies there. Jim, can you come and sort this out? Fingers, mate. That's the problem. Get it on. Move them back. Move them back. One, two, one, two, one, two. That's it. That's it. Sweet as done and dealt. You're sorted. That's it. Just me now Just me, I said, now. You're supposed to have learnt that. - I have learnt it. - You have not learnt it. I think anyone knows what that's supposed to mean. - It's European. - It is not. And what's all this happening? That is microphone technique. That is a biro! I know that. Just take your chair over there now and try and do one thing right. Go on. - Excuse me. - What? Just take that look off your face. Why? I can see through that smile. You would love to be right. I'll bet you couldn't sleep good last night, couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door. Well, I've got news for you. I knew it though! Did you? Yeah, somebody told me. Molly Dench, actress... You know, no, you know the wonderful, wonderful, marvelous thing about actors and actresses is always the fun, the very, very funny stories they've always got to tell. And do. Yes, no, there's one particular time I'm thinking of. It happened to me when I was in a play, that's right. A lot of other marvellous actors in the play. Johnny, marvellous actor. And this other girl, a younger actress. God, wonderful young actor, a very good friend of mine. I can't remember her name, but she was also in the play. And in the play I had to be on stage, that's right, it's coming back to me now. And I had a speech, you know, here I stand, wild for... And she had to come on stage, you see. And in a hat, sorry. In a hat, that's right. And this particular night I'm thinking of, I was on stage doing my speech and she came on, and she'd forgotten to put on her hat. Johnny was on the floor! How the rest of us ever manage to carry on, I'll never know. I don't think the audience noticed, you know, but... It's just one of those extraordinary things that I think can only happen in theatre. One of those extraordinary, unique sort of things. Marvellous times. Hello, my name is Tilly Jompson and I'm a younger character actress. The wonderful thing about being an actress is you go to rehearsals in the morning and everybody says Moooorning! And then you all kiss each other, it's lovely. At rehearsals I like to sit on my chair in this interesting fashion. Makes me look more vulnerable, doesn't it? A very important thing to remember when you're a younger actress is always to speak as if you're two years old. And then the director doesn't tell you off too much if your acting's crap. Once, I had to be in a play, and my part was called girl on chair, so I had to sit on a chair, and one night, I fell off it. And I cracked my skull open on a table and there was a lot of blood and brains everywhere. And it was very strange because the audience, as one person, threw back their heads and laughed at me. I was a bit confused at first but then I thought... No, actually, no. I'm communicating with them. I've always been so very... Communicating with them. I've always been so very cute. What are you doing? I don't know where that came from, I'm sorry. Go on. What are you doing? I'm trying to do a character. Where do you got up to? I am continuing to do this! I can't believe you'd be so cruel. Come on. What's your problem? I thought you were so brilliant. You should do it. Don't let me stop you. Just I never heard anyone talk like that, that's all. What's the point of doing a character? Well, that girl in A Sense of Guilt, maybe, but no one normal. No, shush! - That is underhand. - Very underhand. And very cheap. It doesn't suit you, Jen. It doesn't suit you to be so cruel. - What's the matter? - You amaze me sometimes. Do you know why? Because you don't even know me. Very funny. You don't even know me, do you Saunders, after all these years? You don't understand, do you? You don't understand that inside this body there is a huge talent just bursting to get out. You see, the thing is, that would never happen in real life, would it? Maybe not, Jennifer, no. But this isn't real life, is it? This is show business, baby. Ladies and gentlemen, you've been more than a super audience. And that's the end of our little show. We're very sorry, but good night to you! Ladies and gentlemen, French & Saunders! Bring them back onto the stage, the fabulous French & Saunders! Subtitles LAPORT INC.
