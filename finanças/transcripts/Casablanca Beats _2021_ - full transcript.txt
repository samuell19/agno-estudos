Hello. - An arts center? - Yes, nearby. No, not that I know of. Okay, thanks. How do I get back to the main road? What road? To go where? Just out. I don't even know where I am. You're in Sidi Moumen. - Sidi Moumen? - Yes. I want the main road. Go straight, then right. At the roundabout, turn right. Okay. It hasn't been used for a while. Is all the equipment there? It should be. And it works? I don't know. Okay. - And the classroom I'll teach in? - Upstairs. I'll go have a look. What is this? Who gave you permission? It's my classroom, isn't it? Not yours alone! It's the music room! Should I take it off? Yeah, right. Now, a little faster. Don't think! Don't look down! Look straight ahead! Slowly... Arms... Chest... Head... Slowly... Quick, quick, quick... Bravo, very good. Good job. See you next week, God willing. Bye. It wasn't accepted, wasn't understood. It didn't come from our culture. People didn't accept it. The baggy clothes, the music. For them, it was music for wackos. Whereas hip-hop didn't just come out of nowhere. Understand? There were real reasons behind it. Reasons that changed the USA, and empowered Afro-American culture. They're still a minority, but they've come a long way. The proof is one of the last U.S. presidents, Obama, was a black man. But their battle continues, believe me. So, if we go back to the main reason hip-hop was created, we find racism, poverty, and humiliation. We saw it in Tunisia, too, in the 2011 movement. Their rap was revolutionary. It was powerful and at war with the system. It was art versus the state and the system. Why? To defend civil rights. See how powerful rap can be? Tunisian rappers had a conscience, had values. See? They understood its power. In Morocco, it was the same. Rap was seen as anti-system. At first, it was boycotted. It's rap that speaks of our lives, of our problems. Things people aren't supposed to know. But they couldn't stop us. Rap blew up! No subject is taboo. Once, if you talked about politics or the King, it was: "Hush! Be quiet." But not anymore. Today, people can express themselves. We've gained greater freedom of expression than we had before. What matters most is that I don't insult you, that I'm not violent with you. I speak to you in a positive and peaceful way. I speak, I express myself. What is the source of my strength? That I'm heard by thousands of people who'll follow me. - You've got soup? - Yes. - Want a bowl? - Yes. And a crepe, please. Say again? A crepe. With what? Cheese? Yes, double cheese. You're new around here? - Yes. - I've never seen you. You live around here? No, I work at an arts center. For music? Yeah, sort of. My classroom is locked. Soumya, open Anas' room, please. She's coming. You always lock it? The classrooms are locked at night. May I have a key? No, we keep the keys. What is this, a government building? It's an arts center. With rules. Anas, I'll open up. To hell with the fools and all those tools. To whoever tries to diss me I say: "Beat it, sissy!" Double B Funny Baby is the best. You think that's jive Let's see if you survive! I don't buy it. - Let's see you do better. - Okay. Right now. Why did you write that? On the street, I pass for a sucker. A sucker. A wuss. "Pussy cat." They don't respect me. Get it? And what did you change with what you wrote? What did I change? - What? - I no longer stay silent. Well, maybe you should've... - Stayed silent. - Thanks. I'm not kidding. Lose that smile. I'm serious. That's not how we defend ourselves. Go back to your seat. Come on, get up. You're on. With no helmet I ride And that's my pride. Got my codes on the street Masks come off, but they still cheat. They think they're da bomb I just carry on. - You're no rapper! - "Sorry, who are you?" You'll do anything for buzz. Bring on da funk No more junk. Out of my way You're all just posers. Don't try to play me For a Big Up you'd slay me. Gotta hit pause. Mask off Only make-up on your face! Mask off. Only make-up on your face! Applause. Got a score to settle? Yeah, with the whole world. Why are you telling me this? I want to talk about it. I don't give a damn! Why are you telling me this? Them? Why should we listen to you settle your problems with some guy? I settle my problems through rap. No biggie. Is that why you rap? Not only. I got other reasons. I don't see them. You can't settle conflicts in the street so you hide behind rap. That's all I see. Or maybe you've got nothing to say coz your family spoiled you. No way. My life isn't what you think. What do you mean? At home, we got nothing. Me too, I'm one of those who... Me too, I sometimes go to bed hungry. My father is out of work! My brother yells at my mom for money! That's how my life is. Nothing like what you said! You have no right to talk to him that way! You didn't even have the guts to keep rapping. He's right. That's all for today. We'd like you to hear what we wrote. Why didn't you stand up? A long time Hip-hop's been waiting for us. Moroccan girl MCs Are few and far between. But vice is there It's everywhere! Everybody knows the deal. Behind your back Their words don't mean jack. Too many enemies Pretend to be friends. They talk shit They think they're tough. But on the street, they get snuffed. Today in hip-hop You gonna hear our voices. Girls gonna rap, break silence, make choices. This is rap, homie, not Arabian Nights I am No-Killah Not Barbie or Cinderella. Watch out I might turn on you. Our style isn't flashy Don't take me for a hussy. We've come a long way. Today you're gonna hear the voices. Of girl rappers Breaking the silence. All the girls. What should I take away from your lyrics? It's about girl rappers. What about them? They rap. That's all? It's just that... there aren't many girl rappers. They don't have the nerve to rap in public. And you have the nerve? Where were you? Butt out. At the center. I didn't find you there. Move over! Always crowding me. I know what's best for you. Right, start by finding a job! Good evening. Evening. How are you? Have a good day? Did you take your pills? Believers, you must obey God and His Prophet. Try to be the first to earn divine pardon... Hey, beautiful. How are you? Paradise welcomes those who believe. God, full of mercy, will choose who to reward. Only God has this ultimate power. The most beautiful way to conclude these words is by praying for our Prophet. It's not possible. All things have their limits. You shouldn't cross them. Yes, I agree with her. Some things can't be spoken of. That's how it is. For example, to me, religion is sacred. I can't rap about it. I can talk about everyday life at great length. But I draw the line at religion. But you don't have to talk about certain subjects in a negative way. You can talk positively about religion. Even if you speak well of religion, praise it... Hold on. Do you even know what you're talking about? I'm not only talking about me. Well, I am. I know your knowledge is limited. You're not up to the task. You don't know me, or what I'm getting at. Tell her. If you talk about limits, your mind is limited. You get it? You're the one creating the limits. No, excuse me. Religion isn't all there is. We're skimming the surface. We're not going deep enough. We should keep in mind that the society we live in is a bit limited about certain things. But it lets us express ourselves through rap. We can move forward, but within limits. We must know those limits, and respect them. It's give-and-take. Society gives us nothing. It gives you the freedom to rap. I took that freedom. You think I'll curse religion in my rhymes? I was coming to that. I'm not only talking about religion, but any touchy subject. If you go too far, society will react. Why do they want to keep us from rapping and dancing? For them, rap will lead us astray. They think we have no rules. But as long as we remain within certain limits, they can't say a word. What's all this about society's limits? Accept it or not, my ideas are my own. They're in my rhymes. It's very simple. If you can't convey an idea in your own home, if no one there gets it, what use is trying outside? Most people are in the dark. Not only about religion, but politics, too. So let's put religion aside and talk politics. I'm clueless about it. When I read the papers all I get is what some politician does. And you want me to talk politics? If you do the research, you'll know what to say. Even if you're informed, there are still limits. I have no limits in my rap. No limits at all? Yes, I can talk about anything. I just need to do the research so I know what I'm talking about. That's all. That's my only limit. You seriously think you can say anything about politics? You see what I mean? You'll say stuff, but will you really speak your mind, all the way? - Sure! - You don't have the guts. When I'm rapping, I write what's in my heart, what I see. But best not be too direct. If you insult them, if you talk about them, they'll lock you up. You think they'd hesitate? You'd get arrested on the spot. I'm not scared. I tell it like it is. Who are you scared of? Tell me, who? Hold on. You think you can say whatever you want about politics? They won't let you. One false move, they'll get you! Whatever! Like you don't know that! Hold on... Say you're writing some underground rhymes. When you write your verse, you'll have to mention all the lobbies in the country. You'll try to cross the line, but you'll reach a point where you can go no further. You'll have to shut up. If you don't, you'll get what's coming! I'd like to know where that point is. Tell us, so we can watch out. - Where is that point? - Prison! I don't know what you're talking about. If you play that game, you won't go to prison. They'll make you disappear! - Cut the crap! - Who'll make him disappear? Abracadabra! How many protests? And nothing's changed. This is a stale debate. Nothing will change. Change begins with me. I have always lived in this country. I grew up thinking a certain way. But one day, I started thinking different. And someone else did the same... I think we all agree: many things in this country don't work. Everybody knows it. And we agree on that. We used to think we could change things by talking about them. But who'll listen to what I say? The day I become a famous artist with millions of people listening to my music, then my words will really be heard. Yes, like that. Keep the pace. Don't stop. Let me forget All my problems. Let me forget All my problems I had so many friends Now it's all over. So many friends. Now it's all over. All over... Give me another groove, man. Time's up. Let's go. Zineb. Please bear in mind that I'm a dancer, not a rapper. Sure. This poor guy's got no life No conscience. His mother sells crepes He steals from the register. She sells what? Crepes. My sandals are shabby... Getting better! No! Let her finish. My sandals are shabby His heels are classy. Well-groomed homie. Always tidy. Got no ride, no transport. No visa, no passport... The main thing is participating. Right. Stop mocking her. - Pistachio, you're next. - Not me. Yes, you. You! Hey, everybody! 16 years, I'm oppressed. My hopes are just a mess Always less. Nothing changes day to day I've looked Out there's no way. They hurt me Buried me. But that's past Finally I'm speaking out. Tradition gnaws at society. Turns into repetition Then obligation. Then into religion and our dreams into oblivion. Friend spying on friend. In the shithole you end Not a penny to spend. Ever read the Qur'an? I'm going to hell? You're pathetic, man. Brainless never reads. Don't give a fuck about love! All them wolves. Tried to succeed Doors are shut. And I'm in pain. Sin saves you money Virtue saves your soul. We strive to survive But we're doomed. Yeah, Pistachio! You're not afraid of anything! Your rhymes are thirty years older than you. I'm young, I swear. At the chorus, you say: "Where?" We say: "Where's this country leading us?" His voice rules! In this land We're not worth a damn. We gave our trust And got only sorrow. Dude got diplomas, ain't got a job. Smokes up Forgets his destiny. Why do we follow the pack? We agree to be crushed So we can live in peace. Just want enough So troubles will cease. This country is cruel How can I be good? I thought art could lift me up Take me somewhere. But for our rights we gotta beg. So I ask them: Where's this country leading us? Where? - Where's this country leading us? - Where? The desert's our home Aimlessly we roam. When we try to talk back We get a smack. Try to find another way We lost anyway. Waiting for change Our hair's gone gray. Our parents smile and lie It's worse for them. Every step I take I get closer to the end. When I hear them lie It seems almost normal. But it's not! And it never will be. So I ask them: Where is this country leading us? You did this without a permit? You're screwed! They'll destroy it all. It's not allowed. It's very touchy. - Anas, for real, you killed it. - It rocks! Did you like our freestyle? "Where's this country leading us"? - Good. - Classy. - We should perform it live. - Hold your horses. Listen, Anas, yesterday I had a crazy vision. I was on a giant stage... Ten thousand people! Chicks everywhere. Chicks everywhere! Imagine them fainting. Oh, Smaïl-le. Smaïl-le. The little Frenchies. Smaïl-le. "Ismaïl." Smaïl-le. - "Ismaïl." - Smaïl-le. You let me fall, asshole. It was crazy! Everyone was jumping and waving banners. You know what they said, Anas? - And me? - You... They can't stand you! It was crazy! You can't even imagine! Totally wild. - Can I be honest? - Yes. Even I don't buy it. Everyone wants you... And I gotta admit I need you too. Wherever you are I chase you down. Many times you ditched me Betrayed me. You're the one I choose But my come-ons you refuse. Going insane Putting up with all your games. Pockets empty, heart heavy I miss you already. Everyone chasing her. Everyone dreaming of her. We all want money, money, money... Everyone chasing her. Everyone dreaming of her. We all want money, money, money... We want money! We all want money! We all want money, money, money... To live, you need money. To be in peace, money. To love, you need money. How can I forget you, honey? To study, you need money! For the hospital, you need money! To be an artist, you need money. And the state wants me to forget! I can't help it Life made me love her. Still looking for her To ask for her hand. By hook or crook, I'll have her. Gonna marry her. Gonna spoil my folks with her. Too bad if you envy me If life smiles at me. I still got the same thought: To make up for what we lost! It was love at first sight You can make my papers right. Everyone is chasing her. Dreams of embracing her. We all want money, money, money... Everyone is chasing her. Dreams of embracing her. We all want money... - Hey, big star. - Hi, man. - How did it go? - Good. - You need practice. - Piss off! - All good. - Yes. When's dinner? You're right on time. As usual! Knucklehead. Careful, I can sue you for that. Move over. You little... Hands off or I'm telling Dad. Show some respect. Smaïl, leave your sister alone. That kitchen is all you know! Hiding among women. You don't know any better? Don't make him mad. Call your brother. It's too salty. I put the right amount. If that's the right amount, bravo. You're still awake. Let me forget. All my problems. Let me forget. All my problems. Smaïl, where you going? Always clinging to me! Come on! Smaïl! Wait! Are you crazy? What is this? I'm exhausted. Doesn't take much. All my problems. Let me forget. All my problems. I had so many friends... Let me! Let me forget the shit I go through, let me. Eyes open I dream I float on the stars. Young as I am I feel like an old man. Too many problems for my age I feel enraged! I see the future as black as my skin. My father only thinks of breaking our bones. My mom gets beaten to spare the children. And me... I feel I'm crumbling! I'm stuck, I'm stumbling. When I try to breathe The smell of filth makes me heave. I dream of being a hero Not living on skid row. I'm done with the strife I want a new life. Won't die stupidly On a raft to Italy I want, here in my country The future to smile at me. Let me forget all this I wanna go higher. Dreaming's both hard and easy But you gotta believe. I'm gonna make it. Gonna dig you out of the dirt we were born in. Though life for us is locked. The key is in our hands. Hip-hop began in New York, in a place called the Bronx. Basically, it's like Casablanca, and Sidi Moumen, where we are. I'm not joking. Come on! Be serious. Casablanca is New York, and the Bronx is Sidi Moumen. You'll start by writing 4 lines, 8 lines, as many as you like. So I know your ideas. How you write, how you think. I'm not kidding! - And if I can't write? - You got WhatsApp? Oh snap! You know what? Get out! Be here at 2 tomorrow. What time? Two. Tomorrow at 2pm I want you here ready, focused... Keep going. That was interesting. Go ahead. Show me what you got. Suddenly, she's silent. All right, show us your attitude. Rap, let's see what you can do. Go ahead, young lady. Come on, spit it out! Amina. Hello, Amina. From the wrong side of town I come. Born from the Positive School My voice will soar. My words are harsh I don't rap in vain. The people are in pain No end in sight. In hypocrisy they swim No complaints. They curse me coz I sing with my veil. Do I need to undress to tell my tale? No contrition My voice is a revolution. Men don't dare Too scared of the State. They rap of things hollow Smoking up in the shadows I believed in real men But they're cattle in a pen. Donkeys and liars Even a donkey isn't as meek. It endures every blow And doesn't turn the other cheek. Anas, I have an issue. She's blunt. You looked at us when you spoke about men? I'm a man, a real one! You dissed me! Any comments? How was her attitude? Not bad! But don't push it. - Strong rhymes, huh? - Sure thing. Powerful. But, rhymes like these, you need to feel them. You need attitude. No, I take it back. It was better before. Amina? Amina! Mom? - Come. - What are you doing here? - Your father's waiting. - Why did you come? - Hello. - Sir. - Yes? - I'm Amina's mom. Nice to meet you. Is there a problem? We didn't put her in an arts center to do "hip-hop." Hip-hop is an art form, ma'am. Not for us, son. She comes home evenings with political lyrics. But it's rap. Don't talk about that! She's got talent, things to say. Sorry, we don't want it. It's not for us. Her father's waiting in the car. He doesn't trust her? We trust her. She's doing nothing wrong. We didn't enroll her for this. We're simple people. We don't want trouble. Sorry, sir. Come! Come here. Here, girl. Come. Closer. But I'm 18 years old. Even though you're 18, your parents can take you out any time. They don't know I'm back. Not yet. But when they find out? They can't find out. Nobody will tell them. Amina, you're gonna get in trouble. I promise there won't be trouble. If they come again, we'll be the ones in trouble. I'm telling you, they won't. They don't know. Rap is the only thing I know how to do. Let her back in. If anything happens, it's on me. Please. Go to your class. We don't want trouble. We can't exclude her. Take two steps in one. One, two, three. A little faster. - I'll give you the cue. - Follow this beat. I can't sing. Shut up already. Okay! Shall we go? You were looking at Smaïl, huh? Okay, start over. A long time Hip-hop's been waiting for us. Moroccan girl MCs are few and far between. But vice is there, it's everywhere. Everybody knows the deal. Behind your back Their words don't mean jack. Too many enemies Pretend to be friends. They talk shit They think they're tough. But on the street they get snuffed. This is rap, homie, not Arabian Nights I am No-Killah Not Barbie or Cinderella. Watch out I might turn on you. Don't slip up Avoid trouble and stay cool I shut the door tight So everything's alright. That's the nerve of the girls of the Positive School. Our style isn't flashy Don't take me for a hussy. We've come a long way! Good. I like what you dropped. It's just that... the rhymes are tight, which is good, but they lack feeling. Nouhaila, you're just reciting your lyrics. You're too focused on the flow. I want to see that attitude we talked about. I want to see it inside the booth. Meryem. Attitude! You're a rapper, look mean! A long time Hip-hop's been waiting for us. Moroccan girl MCs are few and far between. But vice is there, it's everywhere. Everybody knows the deal. Behind your back Their words don't mean jack. Too many enemies Pretend to be friends. They think they're tough. But on the street They get snuffed. This is rap, homie, Not Arabian Nights I am No-Killah Not Barbie or Cinderella. Watch out I might turn on you. Don't slip up Stay out of trouble and keep cool I shut the door tight So everything's alright. That's the nerve of the girls of the Positive School. Our style isn't flashy Don't take me for a hussy. We've come a long way! Sorry, I ruined your shirt. See you. Okay, bye. Don't forget about tomorrow. Okay. See you, girls. Wait! You blind, or what? Not my fault I'm angry. That I won't be a phony. That my heart became stony. Coz I see and endure disdain. For you, women are slaves It makes me sick. For you, being a man Means dominating us. Look at our mother in chains. Never had a voice And never complained! The dullness she knows Is like being behind bars. With me that's all over I won't be a pushover I want us to be equal Man and woman. Same rights and freedoms comin'. Being my brother. Gives you no rights Over me. Life has torn me apart Split my personality. The Meryem inside Is not the one on the outside. I can only be me On stage where I'm free. Where color and appearance Make no difference I dare to raise my voice That the mic sends off. I impose my thoughts My personality I'm myself When I rap. Just try to accept that. It's enough I wear a veil. That's all I got to say. About time! - She finally grew her butt! - Pills. She'll regret it. She tried and tried but she was never sexy. She used to look like a guy! You should see how she swings her ass. Plus-size booty! She can't even breathe in her jeans. She's about to pop! Poor thing. They want to hold me back. They want to hold me back. They want to hold me back. To tame me they clipped my wings Like a swallow. They want to hold me back. Back or forward, just shut your trap, bitch! Mind your tongue! - What? - Watch it! Some nerve! I'll fuck you up! I'm so scared! Let's see you try. Step outside, I'll show you. To tame me, they clipped my wings Like a swallow. They can't shut me up My mouth speaks the truth. With it, I'll fight, yes Revealing their ugliness. Who will listen? Here nobody gives a damn Just insults and scams. We have no frills. I didn't choose this destiny Full of ills I can't stand it As a hooker isn't how I'll end it. So if I walk down the street, a guy has the right to harass me? The problem isn't what I wear or how I do my hair, but what he's got in his head. I'll wear what I like, do what I want. I respect him, I respect myself. If he doesn't like it, too bad. My sister wears the veil. Nobody harasses her. Everyone respects her. That's her choice. I respect you, but I don't care. I've got no problem with you. We're all "open-mind" here. We're all here for the same thing: hip-hop. But look what happened to Nouhaila. No respect unless you respect yourself. What about our rights? Why is it always about them? We should have the same rights. Hold on. Sorry to interrupt. But dress decently, and nobody will harass you. I am decent. Look, you're in shorts! If you dress like me, respect goes out the window. Excuse me, mentalities evolve. Not here. Abroad. Don't forget this is a Muslim country. Remember that. So how do I look to you? Normal. I respect myself. I dress normally, but I get the same thing. See? It's the mindset, not the clothes. It's not about what you wear. It's people's attitudes. Even you only wear a half-veil. It's not about the veil. None of us wears the veil properly. Not you, not me, none of us here. Because half the veiled girls in Morocco don't wear it correctly. Even jeans are forbidden. My neck isn't covered, that's your issue with my veil, right? Hey, Ms. Decency, if jeans are forbidden, why do you wear them? Nobody's perfect. Do you pray on time, at the mosque? What good is praying if you harass a girl afterwards? I see guys with beards who do that kind of thing. And I don't like it. As a guy, first I mind my behavior, then I'll worry about praying. We don't preach religion here! If she goes out dressed decently, walks normally, nobody will badmouth her. At least then, if you hear an insult, it's not your fault. But Nouhaila has tights under her torn jeans. She's not showing any skin. Tights aren't the issue. Please, listen up. We're not here to waste our time on useless details. Here's our Sheikh! Think you're an Imam? Gonna teach me respect? This isn't your correctional center. Shut up. You're a major disappointment. You'll end up like this newbie. He thinks he has the truth and that we're all sinners. You think you're on a religious show? He watches too much TV. Keep going and you'll end up like those fanatics, tortured in jail. Careful, she bites! Seasonal affective disorder? You were so sweet in class! Or is it because Anas was there? Shut up, "Open Mind." You'll wind up marrying your cousin. I don't have a cousin. So? You're gonna marry a girl like me? I doubt that. See? Schizophrenic. What? Being free, she calls that schizophrenic. Okay. Schizophrenics in da house! Gaze into the distance. You're somewhere else. Floating... Everybody. Everybody. Everybody! Find your place. Take up the space. Move in, move out. Fill the whole space, every corner! Live in the moment! Move, come on. Don't let them shut you in! Why are you sitting alone? I'm tired. If you're tired, stay home. I don't like mingling with people. Here you don't get to choose. Go with them. Come on, move it. Now, come closer. Move away. Isolate yourself. Give me the beat! What do you need? Soufiane, I'm broken. He asked what you need. Hold on. They said, "Shut up, girl". "Where you going? Tryin' to fly away?" "Stay put, don't work No fun allowed!" But I wanna live! Like it or not I'll make it! Got the beat in me It's my real homie. There were five youths between 20 and 25. From Sidi Moumen. Local guys. They blew themselves up. They were terrorists. They committed an attack on a hotel. 5-star. They weren't five. They were twelve. Five attacks, not five guys. Twelve suicide bombers committed five attacks in different places: a hotel, a cemetery, a restaurant, and other places. Just to rectify. It gave the Sidi Moumen hood a bad rep. A few local guys commit these attacks and they think we're all terrorists. See? The cells started out here, in Sidi Moumen. Then they spread. Gradually, like a tumor. This is their cradle. They blew themselves up with suicide belts. They show up, you hear "Allahou Akbar" and pop! What's the matter? That's the reality of Sidi Moumen. Just accept it. I'm a suicide bomber, and so are you! I don't find that funny. Innocent people were killed. Their lives were taken. Someone goes and blows himself up for an idea. He took the lives of people who were somebody's parents, somebody's children. It's no laughing matter. You're right. We're not laughing at them. We know people died and that's terrible, but... Anas, people were just chilling. Some eating sushi, others... Listen. Some were eating sushi, others fish. Whatever they liked. Everything was calm. And then... You weren't even born. Abdou? Those kids never should've gotten into that. First of all, they should've had self-confidence. If you believe in yourself, nobody can force you into something you don't believe in. Second, you must hold tight to your convictions. If you have a good image of Islam, follow Allah's path, pray, read the Qur'an, nobody can buy you. Say you're poor, but on the righteous path. They'll try to give you money, take care of you, then gradually mislead you. Like she said. They'll influence you and try to change your ideas. But if you've got self-confidence, even if they have other plans, it won't work. It's not about faith. People who do such things are light-years from religion. No one with real faith would've done that. If they understood Islam, they'd know what it means. It means "peace." Even if I didn't rap, or practice any art form, I wouldn't have let myself... They claim it's not made-up, that it comes from the Qur'an. That they follow Islam and this so-called "Jihad" or "profession of faith," is to be found in our religion, in the Qur'an. They only consider half the text. If you see a sin, it is said: "You may change it by force, words or the heart." They only retain "force," and move onto violence. If they see someone deviate... Yesterday I was at the barber's with a homie. He said, "Don't get that haircut." He even said, "Music is a sin." I swore to God it wasn't! I pressed him. I said, "Show me the verse, "and I'll stop making music." All that matters is your faith. Strong faith is rare. You've just put your finger on the real cause of this. They have strong faith. So strong they're willing to sacrifice themselves for it. Strong faith, but with the wrong beliefs. Anas, we follow religion. The Prophet lived with Jews, no problem. So, we should do the same. It's between God and us. Once I posted something on Facebook about this. I said that, among my friends, you can find Christians, who, even so, are good and don't rape kids. You can also find Jews who do nothing wrong. It's not... it's not because they're Christians that I shouldn't talk to them. Since they do nothing to harm humanity. I got destroyed in the comments! - Abdou didn't want to come. - Why not? He's busy with other activities. In a center. Right? Where they play music. My brothers, what pushes us into depravity and leads us astray, we know where it takes us. Right. Some musical instruments are permitted, others forbidden. That's what our religion says. Don't forget about dance, God forbid. Dance means intermixing. In our religion, men and women don't mix. Wake up, Abdou! They've perverted this generation. The Prophet, peace be upon Him, said: "The lawful is clear and the prohibited is clear." Everything that lures us from God's path is a sin. Yes, the line between Good and evil is clear. This is a land of Islam Not one of nonbelievers. Or idol-worshipers. And yet... In this clash of civilizations And religions I can't tell what's allowed? Forbidden? Where is the line Between belief and deviance? Does the Imam preach What the holy book teaches? Some sully our religion With their allusions. So, many have taken A view of Islam that's mistaken I don't do hip-hop Coz I can't stop. It's coz it taught me And the peace it brought me. Bridgin' the division Of passion and religion. Together Like mother and father. Been studying, gonna keep it up. It's not to show off That I do hip-hop. I want to understand this world So when I'm gone I pass something on. I'll denounce the impostors And the liars. Reach some hearts No bitterness or anger. Only God, who I love, Can judge me. No imposter Will tell me what to do. My faith is greater In God, the creator. No one can make me an extremist or forget my faith. Hit it! Got my headphones on Got my cap. Got my vinyl Like the days of real hip-hop. Today they all pretend they can rap! Peace, Love, Unity My pen is my weapon. Anas, see this money? It's for the concert. We want to have this concert. - What do we want? - A concert! Get back in the studio. Break's over. Don't push me, sir! Nobody likes us. I'm not giving up on this concert. Guess I'll have to do it in my mansion! That's why I love them. They're nuts. Hey, up here! I'm speaking to you from this pulpit! We hereby announce a concert. Read him this letter. Want a concert? We want a concert! We want to give a concert. And we will, Anas! Eyes on the moon I have no more tears. They left me alone I gamble with my life My only end is in hell. Yes, in hell. Fruit of our sins Will be lost at poker. It's a sad story. My life is lonely. My life is lonely. Took me places. A trip around the world. What do you think of Mr. Smail's performance? Great! He got carried away. Totally. Yeah, like he was praying. I bet you wouldn't have been this focused kneeling on your prayer rug. The beardies want to throw stones at us. What did he say? They want to throw stones. - They say we're infidels. - But your beard is on your head. To each his beard! In your armpits, or head! Some have a nest on their chest! Eyes on the moon I have no more tears. They left me alone I gamble with my life My only end is in hell. Yes, in hell. Fruit of our sins Will be lost at poker. Explain those four lines. Their meaning? Anas, know that all we write is sincere: "I have no more tears, they left me alone." When you stop crying, you're left on your own. Next part... "I gamble with my life, my only end is in hell." For us, life is a gamble. Every day is a gamble. Who knows how it will end? Hell's the only possible end for us. Yes, hell. All you gain from sin goes to hell. Here, sin is a metaphor for money. Wow, deep! The concert will feature youth from the center. Kids our age. We'll be performing. - We do rap, dance. - Buy a ticket from us. Rap and dance! Shame on you! Go study instead! What's his problem? - I'm in a hurry. - No worries, bye. In a hurry, sure! Weirdo. Here. - Thank you. - Thanks so much. God bless you. From the top. Anas, this mic doesn't work. Later. Play the music. When your turn comes, switch. I got energy, won't waste it. Got a dream, won't erase it. We're still young Our life's not done. Don't want vice Want a peaceful run. On stage, remember nobody knows you. When you arrive, introduce yourself. The performer comes on stage... My song is about the youth of today. Any young people here today? Get it? You test the waters, okay? You warm up the audience. Hello. Your entrance is a little shy. Hello. Hey, y'all! We gonna set this place on fire? We gonna set this place on fire? Blast the music! Shut up or I'll give you a makeover. This is the girls' room. Check me out. Get out of here! - What? - Get out! Ready? Yeah! Are you ready to do this concert? There's a huge crowd waiting. Your parents, siblings, friends... Friends and strangers. Anas, we gotta start. The place is packed. Get ready. Let me hear your shout. Who are we? Positive School! They're different ages. They do dance, rap, beatbox. It will be their first time on stage. I want you to cheer real loud for them. 1, 2, 3... Everyone wants you. And I gotta admit I need you too. Wherever you are I chase you down. A lot of times you ditched me Betrayed me. You're the one I choose But my come-ons you refuse. Going insane Putting up with all your games. Pockets empty, heart heavy I miss you already. Everyone chases her. Everyone dreams of her. We all want money, money, money... We want money! To live, you need money. To be in peace, money. To love, you need money. How can I forget her? Sir, we don't want our daughter dancing in public! She's doing nothing wrong. For us, it's wrong. Our style isn't flashy Don't take me for a hussy. We've come a long way! Today, you're gonna hear the voices. Of the girls, the girls, the girls. Girls who rap And break the silence. All the girls, the girls! Near or far Hear us roar! Let me in. - My sister's inside. - So what? You teach them filth, that's what! Filth? - Am I not clear? - It's clear you're sick. Listen up! She's my sister, she answers to me. - I'm her guardian. - It's her choice. Positive School times Gotta drop my rhymes I just began my career I won't stay in the rear. Fuck you, fancy rappers Better hide. If you get up on stage But lose your pride. My country charms me Even though it harms me. In the ER, hours spent We pitched a tent. The doctor, for all his degrees Barely even sees us. This is too much! We've got children and families. It's shameful. - What's shameful? - This depravity. - Girls dancing almost naked. - It's sinful! - Are you deranged? - No, you are! Let that girl in. Anas! No, she's not going in! Yes, she is. Calm down! Soumya! Stop the concert! What, you don't care? - Doesn't matter what they say. - What matters? We've been fighting for years for this center and you and your ego ruin it all. If I had an ego, I wouldn't be here. There are rules! Those are your rules. Not mine. The important thing is: don't run from your reality. Because your reality is this. You were born here, like it or not. But that doesn't mean you should give up. On the contrary, you must fight. Only you can talk about yourselves. So if something hurts you, makes you suffer, say it. Speak up. Raise your voice! What counts is where your words take us. How they change us. How they really make us feel. Will they stir something inside us? I could talk about society all night long. Talk politics all year. But when your head hits the pillow, when you fall asleep, only your problems remain. Your family, your living conditions. Your own personal reality. What reality do you go home to? Has something changed or is it still the same? It depends. Do you talk about it or run from it? Talk about it. You have to... You have to change it. Because you didn't choose it. Some things in your reality, you talk and talk about, at some point you just stop. Or you have to keep lying to yourself. And so? You'll lie to yourself your whole life? And pretend you believe those lies? Continue crying? If you believe it, why cry? The die is cast. You believe it. It's too late. It's never too late. If you want to change, it's never too late to stop lying to yourself. Life isn't a handout. Nobody's gonna come up and say, "I'll change your life." What if you lose your appetite for life? You get it back. And if you can't? You keep searching. You must be looking in the wrong places. If you're in the wrong place, surrounded by people... who are bad. What then? Look for good people. - If you can't find any? - You can. - No. - Yes. Or else, you're still looking in the wrong place. If you didn't find them here, look elsewhere. Never stop. Keep looking. And if you're tired? Die. And be at peace. You say you're looking for positive people, but your thoughts are negative. You say you're tired, you keep projecting negative thoughts. It won't help. "I'll find good people. I'll change my life. "I can do it on my own." It's simple for no one. For Smaïl, it's not simple. For Meryem, it's not simple. For Nouhaïla, it's not simple. I bet it isn't for you either. Even for me, life hasn't been simple. Maybe that's why I'm here. I used to have another life. I didn't like it. I left it. I started all over again. I didn't come out of nowhere. See where reality can take you? True reality. It can stir everything inside you. Your sadness, your anger. I strive to break free of all this. I want you all to break free too. If not, you'll never make it. I looked in all the wrong places. Many wrong places. I wasted a lot of time. Nobody showed me where to look. I didn't have any of this. From now on, you'll do it without me. Hey you! It's not over! It has just begun. It all started here The end is nowhere near. We're done asking Where the country's going. We lead The country is following. Life's no treasure chest Gotta muscle the rest. We'll take what's ours That's all that matters. We're not backing down! Never gonna tire I'm young but inspired. Even when you're gone Your images live on. You taught me to speak up To spill my guts I've learned To blaze my own trail I no longer cower Speaking truth to power. And I'm just gettin' started. Year after year They silenced us with fear. Think you can stop us? Think again! I put up my guard Nobody gonna knock me out. Gonna hear a big boom And we will rise again. Like it or not. Gonna hear a big boom And we will rise again. Nothing lasts forever Like it or not. Gonna hear a big boom And we will rise again. Nothing lasts forever, Like it or not. Gonna hear a big boom And we will rise again
