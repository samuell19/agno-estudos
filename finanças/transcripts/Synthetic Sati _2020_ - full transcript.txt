Are you really ending everything here, Paro? I have never fought with you. I have never cheated on you. I am just doing what I had to do after yesterday, Arjo. Yesterday? Yesterday what? Did I force you? -Listen I... - Are you not my girlfriend? I-I don't want to talk about it, okay? Also, how dare you call me a b***h? What? When did I call you a b***h? Seriously, Arjo? When did I call you a b***h? -You'll deny everything now, is it? -What rubbish are you saying? You didn't call me a b***h? Just wait a second. What? It's not there now. Maybe it got deleted. Again a lie? Right? Do whatever. And yes. Listen. You have a great life. Who's it? You're getting bored at the party, aren't you? Please listen to me the next time I tell you that I'm not up for something. So, do you want to go somewhere else? Just you and me. -No. I'll go home. - What's wrong? Look, I'm not feeling like it, Arjo. Arjo, please. Arjo! I am not liking it! What the hell is wrong with you? I don't believe this. Mephistopheles doesn't come in search of souls to corrupt. But comes to collect the souls of them who are already corrupt. We find this character from 'Doctor Faustus' in many artistic and cinematic works. -Ma'am, can you please explain something? -Yes? Does studying 'Doctor Faustus' at the Master's level have any relevance today? Well said, bro. See ma'am, they're being oversmart again. -What else can I say? -Why do you say the same thing? -He's not wrong. -What do you mean? -You'll say it's wrong. -Why? I didn't say anything wrong. -He has a point. -What else, ma'am? When I needed help, none of them stood by me. Instead, they blamed me. This guy. Artist Aritro Talpatra. Posted vulgar cartoons of me on social media. In the name of the freedom of expression. She's the feminist blogger, Ritarshi. She was nowhere to be found when I needed her. And of course. Chauvinist Sourav Sen. He's responsible for my image as a social outcast. And that's Mahamaya. She was the only one who supported me fully without prejudice. On social media. But even though we've studied at the same tuition for two years... We've hardly ever talked. Maybe, she wants to talk... Maybe not... Hey! What are you murmuring? Huh? No. Sorry. It's time you all start taking it seriously. Second year and that too, Master's. What's with all the message beeps? Addicted to social media! Ma'am. This isn't social media. It's much bigger. It's called Anonyma. Here, you can open your chat box and write anything to anyone. But no one can tell who is writing. Identity is hidden. Great! Introduce her to this. She'll have good use for it. She keeps talking to herself all day. -Okay, bye ma'am. –I'll take off. THERE'S A GODDESS WITHIN YOU I've received 25 messages so far. That's hardly a number. I've already reaceived 40 messages-- -There he goes again! -...and I've started chatting too. -I uninstalled it after a few messages. -Well done. -Anonymity is a social construct. -Hey look, it's Paro! Ask her. -Let her be. -Hang on. Hey, Paro! -Huh? -Just curious... How many did you get on Anonyma? Allegations? What the f**k guys? Huh? Did you get fun out of this? Paro! Paro! Hang on, Paro Those guys can be real jerks. Please don't mind. No, it's okay. -Um... -Do you want to say something? Yeah... What were you guys talking about? What app? -Anonyma? -Anonyma? Yeah, Anonyma. So how do you use it? Oh, it's very easy. I'll tell you on the way. The script needs to be reworked, Saikat. We need to show a happy family. -Mom? -Just a minute. Yeah. Everyone sits around a dining table, laughing. I want awareness that our brand makes family products. Disgusting! Seriously? Does she have any shame? She'll ruin her family's honour. A fatherless girl, I thought she'd at least keep her father's honour. Didn't even care about that. That's not for you, Paro. Keep it back. People of Bengal! We won't hold our heads low and stay silent. We will retort! Speaking up might… (song playing) Have you lost all happiness in life? Want it back? Then-- Then message us the correct answer right away… Are you scared to say it? Why are you scared? I'm there for you. Anonyma... So basically, go to Anonyma's website or download the app. Then create a fake username and password and then open an account. That's it. Your first step is done. Then, just go on social media and check out who have shared links. And if you want to send a secret message to someone, just shoot. Someone might continue chatting with you or share it on social media. But if I can't reveal my identity, then what's the point? That's exactly the point of this app. To hide behind masks. Got it? I can't take it! Dinner's on the table. Have it. Yeah, coming. Hmm? Bloody fake. What is it about her? Am I getting attracted to her? Hey. Hey! Got change for Rs. 100? Huh? I'm asking if you have change for Rs. 100. -Oh, yeah. Sorry, didn't hear you. -Here, Aritro. I think I have change for Rs. 100. Here you go. -Thank you. – Welcome. Thanks. Did you not hear him? -No, I didn't hear him at all. -Can't always be lost in your own world, Paro. Sometimes try to get out of here and interact with people. Real people. -Bye then. -Hmm. By the way, I know your little secret, huh. -Huh? -Bye. Don't you want to talk? I want to talk. Who are you? You don't know me at all. Why are you disturbing? So don't pretend. You wouldn't get so angry earlier. Who are you? If I wanted to tell you that, I wouldn't ping you on Anonyma. What happened to you is wrong. Why don't you start over? I want to. But I don't know how to. You need someone to talk to. No I don't. I am alone. And I'm happy. If you are in pain, you should talk to someone. Whom should I talk to? Mom? She's always busy with work. I haven't really shared anything with her in the past 2 years. Dad... He's happy up there. Okay, forget it. Is there someone special... or do you like someone? Yeah… I do. But it's quite complicated. Why is it complicated? Talk about it. That's impossible. In that case... Imagine you're talking to that person right now. Where'd you go? Right here. Me too. (song playing) Are you real, Sati? That can't be revealed. But why not? Do you like hiding behind a mask all the time? Don't you feel like knowing the person within? We're always wearing masks, aren't we? One mask when we are with our families... Another in front of friends... A different mask in front of our lover... It is only with ourselves that we are without a mask. But... I want to see you Sati. Feel you. Is it so difficult to be real? We are always surrounded by real people. Yet we choose to immerse ourselves. Life is nothing but a multicoloured bubble. And we choose to live inside it knowing that it'll burst one day. -Oh. -Hi! Hi! -Ma'am isn't opening the door? –No. I think it's a holiday today, huh? Should we just leave? Yeah, I guess. -Let's go. -So, I was saying... Huh? What did you mean the other day? I mean...you said you know my little secret. Anonyma. Everyone was going crazy. They were all wondering who was sending them such insulting texts. I know it's you. It's you, right? Are you Sati? Did you say something? No...I meant I owe you a treat! You know what? Hey! What... What are you doing? Real people, real experiences. Bye. I've got good news and bad news. What good news? Good news is that, today onwards you are free. Hmm? Your 'Synthetic' friend won't interrupt your life anymore. What do you mean? Go out there. Make real friends. People who will take you as you are. People who you can talk to, have fun in the rain with... watch all Uma Thurman films with. But... How is this good news, Sati? I can do all these with you too, right? I mean, if you show up. No. That's not how it works. Today onwards I'm quitting this app for good. Because I've met someone under the rain and she is beautiful! I can't forget her! I can see a future with her. Me too. I don't think we should study this. This... No but seriously. It doesn't deserve all the hype. -Hi. -Hi -I don't understand the hype about the show. -Tell me, come on. -No no, no. This-- -Maa'm, you don't know. -This isn't worth watching. -Yeah. -No, you should watch it. -Will watching it... No. Ma'am shouldn't watch it. No, she should know how it can be a big disaster. -Not at all, ma'am. -I think it's overhyped. -You 'think'? Say you're sure. -Alright, it's okay. -I won't watch it. -You could try it, though. Should I watch 'Black Mirror' instead? What do you say? -Yeah, yeah. -Yes! -Hey. -Huh? I feel we talk more about shows than studies at tuition class! Oh! Who started it? I won't spoonfeed you at the Master's level. Ma'am, he just watches web series at home, doesn't study at all. -But here he has lots to say. -You watch the web series at my expense! Wow! What do you do? You just get proposals on Anonyma. Ma'am? Please excuse me. THERE'S A GODDESS WITHIN YOU Paro? Or Sati? Who am I? Or am I both? Yeah, hi.. I just called you to tell you that I love you. Paro? Is something wrong, dear? Are you upset? Do you need money? No, no. It's nothing like that. Actually... Every night when you gently pull the blanket over me... Hmm? Or adjust the temperature of the AC... I don't get to say it then... That's why I thought of telling you now. When I come home today, will you have a chat with me, mom? Actually, someone has told me... to come out of my thoughts and talk to real people. That's what I'm doing. Paro… I love you, Mom. Mahamaya? I have something to tell you. (song playing)
