(traffic rumbling) (people chattering) (quiet music) - I remember distinctly as a kid spending a lot of time on my aunt's farm, outside of a small village of Heidelberg where we grew up. And she had a farm, animals, vegetables, and I remember the smells and her cooking. And to this day every time I eat a cherry tomato or a green bean or I smell hay it immediately takes me back. (cheering) What got me interested in The Bocuse d'Or I was a young cook and I was watching a documentary of Canadian Chef Robert Sulatycky who competed for Canada. And I remember just being really inspired watching that. And I knew that one day I'm going to compete in this competition. (jaunty orchestral music) (crowd cheering) (scraping) (applause) (cheering) (cheering) (cheering) (quiet music) (speaking foreign language) (applause) (cheering) - I see the Bocuse competition like the Olympics of cuisine. One athlete, a chef, who'll be on the podium cooking for 5 1/2 hours. - To cook for your country is a monster responsibility. Because it says who we are. It's not only a competition. It's not about the winning. It's about representing. - The Bocuse d'Or is a competition that was created by Paul Bocuse as a way to bring chefs out from behind the scenes and into the spotlight. (quiet music) - Paul Bocuse, for me, is one of the most famous chefs in the world, if not the famous chef in the world. He created the cuisine that was second to none. And for about 50 years he's had three-star Michelin restaurants. So he was a focused man. But he was definitely a showman as well. Why is the Bocuse so important, very simple. Premier culinary competition world wide. It's just not all the French cuisine. It's different countries bringing their touch to a cuisine that's been around for a long, long time. - [Jenna] It's so important for us to partake in this global challenge. It's the pinnacle of food competition. If we want to maintain that presence in the world of food, Canada needs to keep pushing to be on that world stage. (traffic rumbling) - In my opinion Trevor is the right person to do this competition. He's young, passionate, he has a lot of energy, lots of experience as well. - I've known Trevor for over 20 years now. He was my Bocuse Commis in Vancouver many moons ago. And he was a young, young, young man, he had great work ethic. Through out the years, Trevor's been nothing but a surprise in his growth. (quiet music) - Trevor was the right candidate because you need someone who's got passion and someone who wants to get there. And he needs all the tools to get there as well. But he had the drive and that motivation and perseverance. - My name is Trevor Ritchie, I'm a Chef Technologist at George Brown College. I was born in Brantford, Ontario, but spent most of my time growing up in Kitchener-Waterloo. (quiet music) I first realized I was interested in cooking at the age of 15. Working at this restaurant in a small village, St. Jacobs, a nice little restaurant. And at the end of service, as the dishwasher, I had to take the garbage out at the end of the day. I had all these garbage bags full of whatever in my hands and then walked out the back to the dumpster and there wasn't a ladder or a staircase and I remember just about like here all these hot veal bones just broke through the bag and the next thing I know I had a face full of garbage. The next day I go in, talk to the chef, sit down, just about to give my notice, and before I got a chance to, he asked me, "Do you want to start prepping? "Would you like to start doing some prep jobs? "Peeling vegetables, slicing, making salads? "Would you be interested in that?" And I said, "Well absolutely, that's great, for sure." Everything was so exciting to me. I started off just peeling carrots and dicing onions and that was so much fun that I had. For some reason I loved always doing the basic things. I always had in mind that I want to compete at the Bocuse d'Or. So what I did is I knew that I needed to work at the best restaurants I could find. I knew that I needed to get involved in competitions. So I went after everything I possibly could. - The competition is three-stages process. Trevor won, last year, the national competition against other chefs coast to coast. He ended up winning the first place, giving him the chance to represent our country. - Winning the National Selection was really exciting. It took a couple of days to sink in. Moving on towards the Continental Selection, the skill level is even higher. - This competition is more than just winning the first place, it's about working together in the same country to make our cuisine be better. And to promote it world wide. - 'Cause it's like, - Yeah I was, - A potato won't be stable enough. - Yeah, - For it to, (quiet music) - The Commis role in the kitchen is very important for a lot of reasons. You need to have strong people around you. This is so much more than just cooking. I'm training everyday, working for the biggest competition in the culinary world. So I need to have somebody that doesn't just have the skills but that has the drive, that has the mentality that has the endurance to go through and withstand the pressures that the contest demands. (quiet music) - The Commis Chef in the Bocuse d'Or is essentially an extension of the candidate. So we all work together to develop our recipes and develop our program. And in a way I sort of fill the gap. - Commis Chef would generally do more of the basic prep. But as it pertains to the Bocuse d'Or it's definitely elevated. That role becomes more increasingly important and they're full-on producing incredible, highly delicate foods. - I was just finishing my program and my chef at the time knew that Trevor was looking for someone. And she got us in touch. - I could tell by the way that she carried herself in her professionalism. Even by the way that she moves, very graceful, serious, but also had a very positive presence. That was everything that I was looking for. - It makes me feel very lucky to be working under someone who is so patient but so passionate, and so driven with what he's doing. He makes sure that I'm coming out of this with more than just the result we want on the podium, it's about me growing as a chef. So to be in that position is really gratifying. Great! (hands slapping) (laughing) (quiet music) - Jenna is a ballerina. When she moves, she moves really beautifully, but she's physically strong. - Growing up I was actually a competitive dancer. Starting from the age of three. And so my experience there, learning that discipline and also pushing myself to be the best that I could, that really showed me my competitive nature and that sort of drive to always out-do myself. I never saw myself making a career out of dance, but taking that thing from my childhood and being able to apply it in a whole new way to match the life that I wanna have now, it's really special. Cooking's always been something that's really cathartic for me. It's a craft for sure, but it's also something that I find to be an art form. There's something that just feels right about being the kitchen and getting to create something out of a raw ingredient and turning it into something that can actually invoke emotion in a person. - [Trevor] On the platter it looks more impressive. - It's how it stands, I would plate one next. Like do you get the bone like to stand get the bone up a little bit? Or a natural curve right? - Our coach, Jame Olberg, was actually the last candidate representing Canada, back in 2017 at the final. I know him as the coach who always told me to love what I'm cooking. That was always what he was enforcing. - [Trevor] I'm very fortunate and very lucky and honored to have him as my coach. He has a wealth of knowledge, amazing chef, more passionate for The Bocuse d'Or, maybe than myself. - The camaraderie that we have on Team Canada is something really special and unique. We have our president and our judge representing Canada, John Higgins, who has really guided us in developing our food. Our Kitchen Assistants, Nick and Kevin, they played really integral roles on the team. Whether that's just making sure we always have our mise en place scaled out for the next day or helping us come up with these insane ideas to create those wild garnishes we're looking for. I couldn't imagine just Trevor and I trying to come up with those ourselves. - A lot of the countries around the world are getting really strong, very talented chefs, different ideas, different flavors, different resources that they may have. It all brings something new to the table. So it was important for us to push the envelope in our design, in our food, in the way that we look, everything, everything that we could think of. When people see us walking in the halls, there's no question, "Oh there's Team Canada." (quiet music) - When you do the platter, it's almost like a piece of jewelry. - We have multiple opportunities to wow the judges on the day of when we're competing. It's not just about when we bring out the food and it's presented to them. It's about how we work and how our kitchen is set up. But one of the most important things is the platter. Everyone remembers the platter of the winning team. - When looking at a platter, the judges will take a particular look at the overall aspect. Does it truly reflect your country? And then does it all go well together? Is it symbolic, does is represent something in particular? And it's almost like you don't have to eat the food that's on it, but you've already tasted it by looking at it. (quiet music) - Over the long-term, understanding that this has been my dream for so long, and okay, now it's happening. You know time to go. So that's when things really started to move. And I got more deep involved into the process. I really started to think of what are the things that I need in order to succeed? And I started to think about what's the best team. I reached out to Luigi, because I was searching for someone, or a team, to design our platter. So that's how it all started. And then I knew that George Brown had a design school. So it was logical for me to approach them and see, "Would you be interested?" - My role was designing and managing the fabrication of the platter. Yeah, I noticed you really liked this. Thomas liked it. - I like this, this has proven to be successful. - [Sean] Okay, so here's the thing. - Sorry one thing, if we did this sort of arrangement and had the garnishes somehow on different levels somehow. I mean even if it was subtle, that would be very impressive I think. - I'll work on that. I was thinking of combining this with that original ripple together. - I love it. - Yeah. - I love it. (quiet music) Sean is an amazing person to work with. He's really easy to talk to. A good listener. A much better listener than I am. And he helps to solve problems and has a very creative way of looking at things. (quiet music) He really enhanced the vision of what we were trying to do. (quiet music) - We're thinking that, I'll tell you from our perspective both Sean and I, we were lookin' them all over last night, and trying to decide exactly which ones to show which ones we should add. - If I had to choose today, you know like Trevor, it has to with one of these. You gotta pick up the pace. I would say either we go two routes, either we do, we do something like this for Mexico, and something like this for France. 'Cause you know I'm obsessed with the mushroom. And I absolutely love this drip thing. I like the water and I love that. The platter, for Mexico, we decided to go with a water theme. That was a progression from a lot of different thinking. Luigi had this idea. And is was important that we were using a Canadian concept for the platter. So one of the concepts that we had was representing the Great Lakes. - [Luigi] We are fortunate enough to have huge and massive resources of fresh water. - We had this really cool idea for a Georgian Bay sort of a look. Which was beautiful, but finding a design that fits within the constraints of the competition and that really highlights the food. Which is the most important. We still landed on a water theme at the end. And we wanted to create something different and try to set the trends rather than follow the trends. Because that's what The Bocuse d'Or is about. It's about what's new, what's innovative for the future. So we wanted to do something different. (quiet music) - The most challenging of this project was the fabrication. Because the form of that design was such an unusual from. In fabrication industry it was pioneering. So we had difficulties to find the right fabricators who were willing to do the job. And because this was an national project many of them were willing to do that. But in terms of technology and in terms of machinery they were short so we had very difficult time to get them onboard. (quiet music) - [Sean] Thank you so much. - It looks amazing. (quiet music) - [Sean] There are some flaws. Please forgive those. - No, no. It's a rough draft, but it looks amazing. With this water concept we decided, "Hey, could we do something "different with the platter?" Maybe we could create some layers of texture in the actual metal. So that's when we decided, "Hey we got this water theme, "why don't we do ripples of water?" - The idea of the ripples in the water thrown by a pebble were there to reinforce the whole idea of bringing Canada out into the world, rippling the effect of our culture, growing, helping people understand how the whole process of creating food is a process that starts with the rain, growing on to the Earth. - The water ripple I don't think has ever been done before. And that's very like, warming and everybody understands that. - Right. We had the elevated boardwalk over the water, lake of the food. We had the special cranberry ponds that the food sat on. Everything was there to put the food in relief. (quiet music) - This competition is all about the chic, slick, like everything high-end as possible. The workmanship on a wood platter is it equal to the workmanship on a sliver platter? The sliver one wins every time. So whatever looks the more luxurious. - Then we still also had the idea of having the ripples. Is that possible on that? - We could, you could, you could emboss it. Imagine, I mean you've got it there, where you've got a soft touch lamination. And then the ripples you could do in that high gloss. - I think that would be that touch. That you were looking for Sean. (quiet music) - When we were designing the book, we actually took this concept of the platter and migrated them into an overall brand identity. And so we embossed the menu with the ripples, we created a logo that was the brand with a fluttering maple leaf that had fallen on the water. Something very typical that one sees in Canada in the fall. And then we incorporated all the elements that had gone into the food in their natural state into the menu so that you could see what were the elements that had been grown, and then how they'd been shaped and re-cooked to become a final garnish for the competition. (quiet music) - So 10 minutes? - Yeah, the fish is cooking if we don't have an oven. So it's cooking in the oven way over there. So, - Okay. - Probably more like 15. To prepare for The Bocuse d'Or you need to practice. And it was really important for us to understand and make sure that everything we're doing is celebrating the theme of the contest. That's proper cooking Canadian products. Are we really treating those products and bringing out the best in them? So that's number one. The pieces of food that are on the plate are the most important thing. So once we figure out all of those things, they're all checked off the list, then it's about repetition. And can you get it done in the amount of time. Can you get it done under the pressure, under the environment of the contest? And with anything, I think the more that you practice, the more confidence you're going to get out of it. - We're very lucky we're able to get a consistent space to work in. To have that corner of the kitchen on our practice days, where we could set up. We had dividers between us and classes going on around us. So we still had all that energy and that noise just beyond those dividers, but it was just us in our sort of bubble, cooking these things that we've been rehearsing. That was the closest thing we could do to replicate the competition environment. - When you're sick and tired of doing that same piece of food for the 100th time, you just gotta remember that each time you do it you're getting stronger, you're building your confidence. And ultimately, on the day, you're gonna be so thankful that you put in all that time. - Sorry? - I don't know. I'll have to get these garnishes out, - [Jenna] Sunchokes, yep. We love sunchokes in Canada. - You'd never know. - [Jenna] No. - [Trevor] It's quite beautiful. (quiet music) The meat dish for Mexico, we really wanted to celebrate the suckling pig. So we tried to do that in as many ways a possible. Roulade of the pork, we wanted to make sure that we had crispy skin. We used the pork belly with dates as well a maple. Quebec fois gras as well as some mushroom preparations, wild mushrooms. We also made a boudin noir which is blood sausage. And then we had other accompaniments like Canadian, Ontario apples, wild rice, naturally harvested it's grown all throughout the prairies. (quiet music) - [Jenna] Our final fish plate that we landed on after so much trial and error and so much changing, it had our salmon piece that had canola and horseradish. Our asparagus piece that was a piece of asparagus wrapped in confit kumquat, compressed yuzu apple with a pea puree on top. And then we had a really eye-catching piece that was in the shape of a clam made of sunchoke with a set clam chowder and caviar and Canadian yukon potato. - We really tried to look at the whole country. We're lucky that we have so many different environments that we can get different ingredients from. It was like four, and then we narrowed it down to three, two and then decided on one. So I don't know what shape it's gonna take. - I knew this was coming when I started dating him. So every year there was one or two competitions. And it's just his thing. It's just what he does. Trevor competes and that's his life. That's his world. That's his hobby, he loves it. - The Bocuse d'Or has been just about a three-year long journey now. And it progressively is getting a little bit more intense as the days go by. And it's been a lot of sacrifice. When I met my wife, Jessica, she knew I was a competitor. She knew that I wanted to compete in The Bocuse d'Or. But we never really understood how long that was going to take. Or what kind of dedication that would take until it actually happened. And that's when you realize this takes a big chunk out of your life. It's been a lot of sacrifice. A lot of family events missed. It's really consuming. - Throughout our whole relationship he's been competing. And I've never seen him so devoted. - You have in your mind all the time that these other chefs, these world-renowned chefs, are putting in all this time and this energy. If I wanna compete at that level I have to constantly be thinking about "Is my food good enough? "Am I doing the right thing? "How can I be better?" It takes a toll, and unfortunately my family, my wife, they're the ones that have to deal with it. I do take some time for family and my wife to do something outside of Bocuse, get away from the kitchen, get your mind off of it. It's easier said than done. And it's no surprise, my family knows sometimes I'm there but I'm not really there. I'm thinkin' about it all the time. (quiet music) - Yes there's challenges. But I think if anything it makes us stronger. Because it's so intense and you have to have such a strong support system to do something this intense. - What holds it all together and gives them some comfort is that they know what I'm working towards and they know it's not permanent. There's some guilt attached to that. But I also know that this is who I am. This is my dream. And there's no turning back. (quiet music) (people chatting) - Anyway I just want to I thought it'd be a good chance for us all to get together and to say thank you and wish Trevor and the team going to Mexico at the weekend much success. It's been a long journey for Trevor. Trevor is, it's been his ambition for a good few years to represent Canada in The Bocuse d'Or competition. I just wanted to gather a few people together here who have made a big difference to the team. - Well I'd just like to thank Chef Higgins and the team for inviting me to this auspicious occasion to wish you well, you and the team well Trevor. We are so proud of what you have accomplished. I have a soft spot in my heart for the Hospitality and Culinary Team. It just never ceases to amaze me the incredible work that you do. - Thank you, thank you so much. For all the work and everything. It's one of the best parts of this experience has been working with all of you and the other people at the college. And we really tapped into everywhere. I remember Luigi, and he's not the only person that's said it to me, but he said, "I can see," after two meetings I had with him he said, "I see you're obsessed with this competition." Like very straight forward, he said, "I can see that you're obsessed with this competition." And I took a step back and it's not the first time I've heard this. But when he said that it made me think a little bit like, "Am I taking it too seriously? "Is this taking too much of my personal life, "my career, is this all worth it?" I had that thought for a few seconds but then I really started to think about the people that I've been able to impact and bring up the next generation of talent. Thank you so much. (applause) (quiet music) (plane engine whirring) When I got off the plane I was really concerned about the food. How is the food? How are we going to get it across the border? Do it properly? And the platter that's another thing. You're shipping this very peculiar, large metal case with this delicate piece of art in it. So you can imagine as a security guard in the airport, you're gonna start asking some questions. So when I saw Sean interacting with some the security guards there and the people in the airport, I was a little bit nervous. I said, "Oh, what if they don't accept this thing "into the country? "We're really in trouble." (serious music) I'm not really sure what he did. I knew that some way or anther he was going to get it there. He said, "You know what, if I have to drive it in "from Canada to drive down to Mexico, "I'll do that, I love road trips." (serious music) You gotta have one of those whatever-it-takes mentalities. That's the only way to go about it. (truck door clicks) (serious music) Setting up and preparing at the competition went really smooth for us. I was happy. And everybody stepped up to the plate as soon as we were allowed to get in the kitchen it was just an army preparing for the battle. - [Jenna] They all came in, in this sort of assembly line and set everything up so quickly, so efficiently, and we knew that we were really lucky to have that. - [Trevor] Knowing that you have that team setting up your equipment and support, giving yo that pat on the back, a little last minute encouragement walking into that kitchen makes a big difference. We ran into some surprises. The oven was not what we were expecting. It was a different oven than we had been practicing with. And that makes a big difference. The type of oven, what model it is, it all effects the cooking. How aggressive is the fan in there? How quickly does it heat up or cool down? There's all sorts of potentials for problems when you're not working with the specific ingredients. And the other other factor is different elevation. You may not think about that. But higher elevation in Mexico City causes water to boil at a different temperature. (intense music) (applause) (cheering) - Good morning everyone. Welcome, it's really a pleasure for me to be here at The Bocuse d'Or Americas. There're 11 exceptional and talented chefs. They're gonna be helped by their Commis and their coach. And they have precisely 5:35 hours to show their dishes. And then only five will go to the Grand Final in Lyon on January 2019. (intense music) - Cooking at the competition was different. It's always different, a different environment, you've got the crowd noise in the background. And you're in an unfamiliar environment. You're using products that are similar to what you were using but maybe not identical. You may get something that's larger or smaller or has a different moisture content. Like I always say, the food is always different, no two items are ever the same. So cooking there was differently more high-pressure than our home kitchen. (intense music) - It was just assumed that we would have a third person assisting us in the kitchen. We found out a few days before we left that we weren't going to have that third person. Suddenly we had this list of things that we knew we needed to get done in that 5 1/2 hour time span and one less person to do it all. We did not freak out at that the situation. We knew it was a curve ball for us, but the night before we competed we were actually told we get that third person in the kitchen. So there was so much back and forth. But we were ready to make whatever changes we needed while still keeping our food at its max quality that we could offer. (intense music) - Trevor was doing amazing. I had reset his program on the fly 'cause he'd gotten so fast. I had asked him to do so many things that we had put aside for the Commis. I think he was 35 minutes ahead of schedule. (announcer speaking over PA) (intense music) When we got to a certain stage where we caught up with time, we lost time. It came down to the crunch for us. They give you a five minute grace period to send the platter. We had 20 seconds away from getting deducted points. (serious music) - [Announcer] We're about the receive the platter from Canada. Okay, so are you guys ready? - [Narrator] During the final detail, very precise. It's a beautiful tray. (speaking foreign language) It's really, really amazing what they do. (people speaking foreign language) (audience cheering) - [Announcer] Big round of applause for Canada! (cheering) (applause) Bravo! (applause) - To win a competition like this you really have to bring something that is an automatic wow. When that platter goes by it has to hit all the notes. It has to be something immediately that you know that's gonna be one of the top countries. So that has to be something with a unique design that's eye catching. When you look at the food you can tell if it tastes good or it doesn't taste good. Without even tasting it. And generally when things are cooked properly they automatically look good. (serious music) (crowd murmuring) - [Announcer over PA] The third place - [Judge] Argentina! (cheers) (applause) - Argentina third prize Bocuse d'Or Americas! (applause) And now for the second place of Bocuse d'Or Americas. (speaking foreign language) Please welcome Mathew (speaking foreign language) (applause) Mario the Regional Manager of Sirha. - [Mario] Canada! (cheering) (upbeat music) - I felt very proud. For him to come in second I thought it was great. You're on the podium in the top five, it's a great spot to be. - Really think that we set ourselves apart right off the bat. Right from how we presented ourselves, our team, the dedication, the professionalism, the way we set up the kitchen. It's funny because you can almost tell what are the stronger teams in the countries before the competition even starts. We knew we had a strong team, a strong design, strong food, good flavors, good coaching. We had all the tools we needed to succeed. So we knew that we were gonna do well. And podium was what we wanted. (quiet music) - Obviously everyone wants first place. But you don't want first place if you don't deserve first place. I think we, despite wanting to have a better placement, we know what we put forward and we were able to look at what the U.S. did to get that top prize and what we were maybe missing. What we could do better. So we were happy with second place in that it was what we felt we deserved. (quiet music) - Did we really deserve second place? It was a tight run. Let's not kid ourselves. I think second was a great placing. It was a great opportunity for Canada to get some respect in the kitchens of The Bocuse d'Or competition. - Placing on the podium, getting the silver Bocuse statue in Mexico was amazing. It was such a wonderful feeling. And to know that we put in all that hard work and for it to pay off and ultimately our ticket to the final in Lyon, that's the big prize. (applause) (quiet music) - Now that Mexico is done and sort of our warmup round has been completed, now it's eye on the prize. We came out of that with so much more knowledge and experience under our belt. I can't imagine going to France without having done that. The team dynamic has only gotten stronger. We're all looking towards that same thing. Trying to figure out what we need to do differently. How we can be a better team, produce better food, what that means. Based on what we saw in Mexico, what we heard from judges, and things that just sort of clicked after we competed we're able to figure out, "Okay this is the direction we need to go in." - All these years, all this work. Getting through the Nationals. Getting through the Continental Selection. Everything leading up to this moment. (cheering) - [Team] Canada, Canada! Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada! Canada, Canada, Canada! (cheering) (quiet music) - [Trevor] There was no rest after Mexico in preparation for Lyon. We practiced pretty much every day. We knew that it was coming. We started to work on garnishes and things like that. - [Jenna] We all had the same mentality. The real work starts now. (team chattering) - This is veal, we changed it. We made massive changes yesterday. Because they had to be done. But that's how the veal is looking now. I cooked the whole thing on the bone. - On the bone. - Obviously Thomas is also stressed. You know it, you can feel it. It needs to stop. Because everyone's doing their very, very best, and I know you're trying your hardest. We need to help you help us. So we know we need you guys to help us with the colors, the lines so they match. Carte Blanche, how you put it on. - Right now I struggling putting all these garnishes in. Now we are adding more. So for that yes, that's a negative point. We are adding three odd objects. We are adding two more garnishes. All of them, - To lock it. - We went with two directions. One with the snow, a platter full of snow idea. The other one, the last one that was we drew here, the idea of a lake. And we both think that both of these are great designs and great directions to go. This is. (paper rustling) Again these are not final. We are supposed to have this next week. We can work on the arrangement. We can work on the combination material finishes and everything. - Not to sound like a broken record but we have to find a way to create drama. My fear is that Norway comes out with that platter and again it's got all this crazy stuff going on. And you just can't help yourself but like that one better. - Because we're up against trying to do something that no Canadian's ever done is to get on the podium, we gotta do funky, weird, interesting, elevated art math. It's almost like a three dimensional platter. Which I think is incredibly challenging and difficult. But it could be the way to go in the modern version of Bocuse d'Or. I don't know if we're there yet. (serious music) - Now we need a few days. - We understand Trevor. Trust me. - Tuesday at the latest I'll bring you, (serious music) - When they decide they have to change the foods in a way that represents their work better, I will follow. Despite the fact that it has made difficulties for design and fabrication. (serious music) The only stress that concerns me was that I meet the deadlines. (serious music) The challenges that we have here first of all let me tell you that these curves, hills, uphills, downhills, the only way that we can achieve a good one is to make them by hand. - This feature what was missing has been a wow, right. That feature becomes very wow. This piece, we have to think of how it's impressive. I think we're getting there because we have, we've framed it very beautifully. - [Sean] I super-duper like this moving curve. - [Luigi] Yeah we've framed it beautifully. (serious music) - [James] Okay, Team Canada. 20 minutes. I'll watch you really close and say you have a little time, you have a little time. You could do a little nicer things. - It took me three hours. Jenna has more work to do on the veal. So I'm gonna take more work on the plate. We'll both get it, shave at least a half and hour at least. - [John] So this where you're gonna be. So we have to be just like the Americans. The Americans, they have to go faster, faster. (serious music) - Okay so I'm going to put it here, like this. - However you want, the presentation, whatever you want. - Again. That changes everything. I remember you mentioned that everybody would have difficulties with the veal. - It's very challenging. - So that's where all those questions, - Yeah. - That came up. - Yeah. (serious music) There were lots of challenges we faced with synchronizing the finalization of the platter and the food. You never want to compromise either. But if the food is not set then the platter is not set either. So finding that, really pushing on both ends, to get the food and the platter to be the best that it could possibly be, it is a huge challenge. (quiet music) - Got that very clean and you don't have the holes and the gap like that. That the judge will nail you for big time. - [Trevor] And you're talking about the gap here? - Yeah. - Yeah. The gap and the inside here. - [James] And I know the workmanship's there brother. Don't, I see you work that. And the fine brunoise and you're adding tons of flavor. And don't stop but I think you could maybe simplify some of the things that you're doing and keep it a little bit cleaner to get a better result. We want you to be able to cook as naturally as you can. So the food is spectacular. The moment you start nipping food it stops tasting good. Come one, let's be honest, the most simple cooking techniques are the best flavor. That's why Bocuse is hard. Because you, they ask you to cook spectacular food in a modern way, but you have to keep those proper techniques going without tweaks destroying them. And it's hard, because I know you hearts and love's in this. And we're not trying to destroy it. We want you sit in the podium brother, okay. You gotta look at this this way guys, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, when you think, "I went to Bocuse d'Or, did I take every risk I could take?" If you do really good work and you came 11th, 12th, is that going to give you the same feeling. Or "I cooked, I kicked some ass that day. "They tasted something they didn't taste before." (quiet music) - I'm, I don't agree with that. Very frankly. - Yeah. It's just not feeling elegant. - I get your point. And you talk about from Chef's perspective. But design elements are things that comes from psychology of all people. Not only designers. It's not something that we create or we say, "They should be like that." - [James] It's like when Trevor put the platter, it was absolutely perfect. That was perfect, now to abstract a little more, so I'm with you guys. But there's no where a platter was empty. All this empty space, I would look at and say, "They didn't figure it out." That's what I see, when I see that. They didn't figure it out. And I'd dismiss the platter. - This was all too crunched. We were feeling. So maybe we need to de-crunch it? But to jump to that other thing, to me that other thing is a losing platter. (serious music) That's not a platter that I would go, "Wow." It would be the opposite. I'd look at it and say, "Did they just throw it all on there?" (serious music) - The constant change made it difficult for a design to finally be nailed down. Being on this team meant never settling for anything. So everyone involved was sort of aware that we were going to keep pushing, we were going to keep changing things. (serious music) - Sean is at the end of the rope. And realistically, for a reason too. Because he realizes we only have five, six weeks to make this tray. So I'm hoping that we decide something. Because otherwise I don't think he feels that he can make it. So what we did is we sat there last night and we tried to incorporate the ideas that, 'cause we were all over the place, and so I sat with Sean and we went through it and, 'cause he thought we had to throw everything out. And I said, "No Sean." And he was really worried about can we even make it in time. And if we're gonna redesign too much. I said, "No, I think we just "have to incorporate some of the key ideas "that you guys had." - I'm not gonna lie, I agree on the one you guys all like, but I still like this too. To me anyone of these is good. - Jenna if you had to decide today? - This one. - Well I think Sean's gonna be - Relieved? - Relieved and grateful. Because I do think it it's a big challenge over the next month, to be able to realize this. (serious music) - As a team, I try to support the chef. I was confident in what we were doing. I just didn't want to deliver something with low quality. (quiet music) - There was not limit really to how much we could change the food. We decided on ingredients and flavors, maybe techniques we wanted to show. But rounding each of that, everything was still sort of up in the air. We'd work on 20 concepts, maybe two would make it to the next round. There was that constant desire for all of our food to be perfect. And because that perfection really doesn't exist that you just keep pushing for a higher standard. And there was no settling on what we were doing. (quiet music) - I like the idea of a pressed dill, like dehydrated. If we put some weight on it so we had a flat piece that sat right on top. So it's like fanned out but flat and crispy almost. - I had help from external sources, shops and internal helpers as well. (machine whirring) - As you can see here it's like a rolling list of the geometry surface. So there's 85,000 lines of dimension. And we're at 53 now. (machine whirring) (cheering) Beautiful! (quiet music) Beautiful! - Good. (intense music) - I used the common area of Maker Lab at the school and students are using the same space. We ran into a little bit of conflict. (laughs) With each other. When I was doing the final coating on the platter and left it to get dry and put all the signs, "Please do not touch." Then after one hour, I went back to check on the work and I noticed that students, unfortunately, sprayed glue on all the platter, (laughs) so next two, three days was me sanding down the whole platter (laughing) and re coating it all over again. - Changing the food is an ongoing process. There are always things that can be improved. And things that don't simply work. That's probably the biggest challenge in The Bocuse d'Or is committing to a garnish. And just because you nailed it last week, doesn't meant you're not gonna have problems the following week. Because food is so different. Products are changing all the time. There may be a product that's available last week that's not available this week. Also the flavor is changing constantly. So to fully commit to something is very challenging. And it's something that really happens all most right up until the end. (intense music) We wanted to use Canadian ingredients to show Canada in its best light. We're looking at things that our farmers are really well known for, some foraged ingredients. - [Jenna] We had a carrot that was cooked in veal bone marrow fat. A pea mosaic which was a slice of braised artichoke with an oxtail gelee and then a veal liver mousse, a pickled pearl onion. And then we served a crispy sweetbread which was essentially blanched sweetbreads bound with mushroom mousse and then breaded, and fried, and sliced. - [Sean] I did sacrifice a lot. I was here working on the platter almost non-stop for the holidays. Without that we wouldn't have had the platter. - [Jenna] On our Chartreuse plate we were working with what would have been seasonal in Canada at the time. We had to use vegetables from the Metro Market. If you're looking at winter in Canada, we'd be using root vegetables. We'd be using beets, parsnips, radishes. We wanted to bring that story with us and represent seasonality of our produce. (upbeat music) - [Trevor] For the fish plate we did a roasted parsnip with chestnut and mushroom. - [Jenna] We had a broccoli and kohlrabi garnish. - [Trevor] Pickled beetroot with ice wine and horseradish. Vegetable and shellfish chartreuse with potato, root vegetables and egg yolk. - You're working better today than you did two practices ago. So long as you know the program, you're fine. 10 minuets to go okay. (serious music) Okay you 10 minutes Team Canada, you have 10. You have time, like perfect. So 45 seconds Team Canada. (serious music) - [Trevor] Okay, you guys need to start grabbing plates. (quiet music) It's nice with the beet and the parsnips. - It's good, very good. - Even if they hand over the chartreuse somehow, - The beetroot is good, right. It smells, it's good. (quiet music) (chattering) (announcer over PA speaking foreign language) - We were all expecting to fly out on the same flight. And Sean was not there with us when we checked in, when we got through security, when we're at the gate. And we start to suspect that something's not going right. - Getting talked to by customs. This platter's beautiful they say. - When we didn't see Sean at the airport it was stressful. There he is. - No that's not Sean. - When we were supposed to fly to France with the rest of the team members, we got to the airport and I noticed that the manager at the counter is trying somehow to refuse to accept the platter without giving any reason. (serious music) - I got some calls from the airport. And it was almost, "Mayday, mayday, mayday, distress here! "Sean's not got on the plane with the platter!" And I was like, "Holy smokes!" And everyone was like, "What do we do next." And no one anticipated this. This was like, "Sean wasn't going to make it the plane." (announcer over PA) - They refused the platter so I went back home. - [Announcer] Final boarding call for flight Air France 351 service to Paris, all passengers are asked to proceed immediately to gate B29. (serious music) (wind whooshing) (crowd murmuring) - Bonjour. (serious music) - We stayed in a little private school in Balan, maybe 20 minutes away from Lyon where the competition is held. (chattering) - Oh this is older than, it's a beautiful old building with a lot of history. I believe it's older than Canada actually. Watch your head when you come up. - It was very bare bones. It was kind of cool actually. It was an old building in this quiet town in France. And you just don't have places like that here. So I was sort of enamored by it actually. But it did come with its difficulties. We didn't have keys for all of the rooms for the first two days. We didn't have wi-fi, they forgot to feed us for the first couple of day as well, until we took it upon ourselves to cook our own meals. - The showers were either freezing cold or boiling hot, that's what you got. (water splashing) - Six o'clock in the morning, half past five in the morning, you're goin' for a shower, you want some hot water, and you get a cold stuff all over your head. It's not very good. - At the end of the day we had a kitchen to train in, we had space to keep our stuff and get organized, and we had beds to sleep in. So pretty much that was all that we needed. We just focused on our task at hand. We weren't concerned about the fact that we were sort of on this island in the middle of a rural town in France. (children chattering) - We're a little bit behind the eightball and we need to pick up the pace. We hadn't got an opportunity to work with all the products. And we hadn't had a chance to put the food on the platter. So that was a major challenge. (quiet music) - Ah, yay! (trolley wheels clacking) Welcome, welcome, good job. (serious music) - Hopefully everything is okay. And everything is in place. Nothing's broken. And we're good to go. (serious music) - I had this feeling something happened it's this huge platter. We're trying to get on an aircraft. It's difficult to explain. (serious music) - Hello! - Finally! - Welcome Sean. - Thank you. - You made it. - Yeah. - The platter is safe and sound? - Yep. - Oh. - [Trevor] This weird, custom metal piece with wires and all these things. (serious music) I had a feeling that he would get there and of course he did. (serious music) - So this is the kitchen. - Okay. Hey Jenna! (laughing) - Welcome, you made it. - You made it. - You had a heart attack I heard. - No I knew you'd come through. (laughing) (thudding) - The inspiration for the new platter actually was in the previous platter. The platter we used in Mexico, in fact depicted the same scenery in the Canadian landscape and we depicted a lake for the platter in Mexico and imagined now that it's winter, it's full of snow. (quiet music) - [Trevor] We really wanted to capture walking into a farm in the winter in Canada. Ooh! - Ooh! - Wow! (gasping in delight) - Wow. - Wow. - Gosh, you can see our food on it. - It's not strong enough. - It's not strong enough. - It's not, okay. - And when the food goes on I think it's gonna totally look amazing and different. - Definitely unique. - Yes. - I feel like I'm on a winter farm. - This is by far our best platter we've ever had, by far. - Yeah I think so. - I don't think anyone's come close. - It is beautiful, that's a good way to describe it. (snoring) (bells ringing) (exhaust hood whirring) (dremel whining) (food sizzling) (person whistling) - Until you go there and you test the products they're just different a lot of proteins, the vegetables. So we had to make some adjustments there and then we, when we actually got to put the food on to the platter, that's when we started to notice some things that needed to be tweaked. We had a few long nights there dealing with certain changes in the menu. (serious music) - When we suddenly saw that we had three garnishes that had white and green on them plus an orange carrot on the outside. It was this moment of, "Okay we need to change this. "What are we gonna do? "We have five days until we compete. "What, what can we do to push all of this "to the level we want it to be at?" (serious music) Nick built these incredible, inedible, foraged decorations to also go on the platter to fill it out a little bit more. Those were things we didn't know we needed to get done in France. But obviously there were going to be changes that needed to be made. We just didn't know what they were until we got there. (serious music) - And even like this is rough. Like it's not perfect. We have to literally find the perfect ones. - The only question I have is when you put the chartreuse down, then you wanna put the flowers on? - Yeah. At the last second possible. - Okay. (serious music) - [Trevor] These are strong, strong on their own. Powerful and these are, - Okay. This is complete. - Yes. - These are complete, these. Yeah, you're right it's not complete. [Trevor] It's interesting eh? But it should be complete. I know it's late now, but something metal or something that like comes up like a spiral behind it or, - Team asked me to change a few things on the platter while we were down in Lyon. It was very challenging. It took a lot of time. I stayed up til one a.m., two a.m. for several days. - Normally what happens is you have the game plan it's scripted before you're even on the plane. The last night the game plan was still being perfected. Nick for instance was out getting some wild grass. So this was like right up until the very, very end. Sean was perfecting the platter. There was a lot of problems with the platter, trying to solve. And I would have said, really the platter wasn't finished until the next morning before it left for the show in Lyon. So this was right up until the wire. This was like the checkered flag, it was almost ready to be dropped, and the platter was finished, amen. (serious music) (speaking foreign language) - When we arrived at the competition the first thing you have to do is set up the kitchen. Which is nerve wracking. It's a kitchen that you've never been in before so you're assuming that things are gonna fit a certain way and the spacing is gonna be a certain way but there's logistical challenges when you're setting up that are stressful. (quiet music) It was really quite a experience going up against Robert Sulatycky, even though he was a coach. I just remember as a kid watching him compete for Canada. That was a cool moment. - [Announcer] One, go. (intense music) (applause) (cheering) Cooking in the final in Lyon was much more grand. A lot more people there. I felt a great amount of support there. We had almost a 100 Canadians up in the cheering stands. Canadian flags waving like crazy. (cheering) - You gotta cook! - Yes chef. - One minutes time. (serious music) (cheering) - Nothing can prepare you for the noise. It's difficult to hear what somebody's saying five feet in front of you. It's that loud in there. Bright lights and the unfamiliar kitchen, pretty nerve wracking. (horns blaring) (cheering) - [Announcer] Thank you Team U.K. (horns blaring) (people yelling) (horns blaring) (mallet thumping) (serious music) - My station, half an hour into the contest, my power was gone. We had a couple technicians come in, try and fix it. - Your team disconnect this. - It doesn't work? - You have plug? - All right. - Big plug? - Right. - If you have, I can reconnect. (serious music) - Trevor didn't have any power on his station aside from the burners so any time he needed to use a blender, food processor, he needed to come over to my station. (serious music) Then the vacuum sealer behind me at one point stopped working because the power had shut off there. (serious music) Someone from the competition came in to ask if I wanted it fixed but I needed it fixed yesterday. So we made it work. - No worries, you're doing great man. (serious music) (cheering) (horns blaring) (cheering) (serious music) (cheering) (announcer speaking foreign language) (cheering) (announcer speaking foreign language) (Paul speaking foreign language on display) - Doing the competition without having Paul Bocuse around was unusual. I remember going to the competition years back and seeing him there. But it was sad that he wasn't there. (somber music) - It was sad, but you know something, he's still alive, the competition is Paul Bocuse. And there was so many chefs that came from all over the world and really appreciate what you've done and what he has done for the profession. He wasn't there in the flesh but he definitely was there in spirit. (applause) (cheering) - This is the first edition with out my father. And yes it was a lot of emotion. But just the fact that you're here all of you, the supporter, the chef, the candidate, showing what you did during the last two days was the best tribute you could have done to my father. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. (applause) (cheering) (uplifting music) (cheering) - Seeing the platter, seeing all of our food on it just before putting it out was very exciting, that was really the first time that we had seen it in that setting with the atmosphere around us. But at the same time it was just like, "Get all the food on, you need to pass it off. "Because you need them to pass it "so that we can go to the station and carve." There was always something else to worry about. So we looked at it, did a final sweep of the whole thing to make sure we were happy with it. And then we sent it off. It was such a fleeting moment. (upbeat music) (announcer chatting) (applause) (cheering) - The platter was past you like a TGV train, it just flies past you. You wanna see the platters, you wanna see the quality, 'cause you wanna have an opinion on the results of the final five or ten countries at the end. (audience cheering) But you don't get much time. I wish you could take longer. But you know something, the food has to be served hot. - The feeling when the platter went up and it was about to go to the judges was pretty incredible. We were really happy about it. Regis Marcon, the announcer, right away said he wanted to put his thoughts in on what he saw. He described it as when you're flying over Canada and you're about to land and you see all of the fields with the frozen wheat and it looked as if you were flying over the prairies. - [Narrator] At the last minute. - Thank you. - Thank you. I should say I'm very hungry. (speaking foreign language) (cheering) - Ladies and gentleman these are our 24 nations that have been competing here over the past two days at The Bocuse d'Or 2019. (quiet music) (audience applauding) Are just preparing to give out the prize for the Bocuse bronze. - [Trevor] This is the moment that everybody's been waiting for. (serious music) Bronze calls and it's Norway. (quiet music) Amazing job, everybody's super excited for them. It's always nerve wracking. I'm sure everybody is sitting there sweating in their boots. It's actually a bit little more nerve wracking than competition itself in some ways. - Shall we be giving out silver? (quiet music) - [Trevor] Sweden came in at second, no surprises there. A strong team, strong foundation, good food. (quiet music) The level of competition is incredible. The depth of experience and infrastructure of some of the teams is remarkable. - [Announcer] The Bocuse d'Or this year. We need a lot help for this magnificent moment. (suspenseful music) - Who can it be? (suspenseful music) - Denmark! (cheering) (applause) (upbeat music) - How did I feel when the results got read out? Empty, sad, sad not for me, I felt sad for the team. I felt sad for everyone who helped us along the way. I really wanted top 10. - We were expecting higher. It was a kind of general feeling. We're super proud. We're a young organization. We did everything we possibly could. So there no regrets and among anybody on the team. - It would have been great to, to see us ranking higher. We aimed for the podium. And if hadn't aimed for the podium then we would have ranked lower anyways. - Everything that leads up to success is hard. It's about the challenge that gets ya to where you wanna go. - I was very, very, very disappointed. There was no feedback given to any of the countries. We can't excel at something you don't know. It's like hittin' a wall all the time. Someone's put an obstacle in front of you and these other teams are so far ahead you're never gonna catch up. Well you know somethin' it's one competition. But the most important thing now is we get up and we get ready for the next one. (quiet music) - I started on this journey training for The Bocuse d'Or, working at George Brown College with the students everyday. It's something that I absolutely love. And taking such a big chunk of time was a sacrifice on its own because I really do love my job. I'm so happy to be back. Being able to translate some of the things that I've learned through this journey has taken some time to reflect and think about how can this experience value to students and the biggest thing that I've learned and that I can share with them is to really follow your dream. And have great goals. And shoot for the starts. Even though we didn't make the podium which is what we always set out to do we were very determined in that, it's not necessarily a failure. You're only considered a failure if you don't get up. As long as you keep pushing forward and you're looking toward the next thing and you become a better chef and a better person, I think that's what it's all about. (quiet music) - The Bocuse d'Or competition. Which is a huge thing. It was very exciting. We are going to watch Canada's top culinary talent face off against one another right here on the stage for a chance to represent Canada at what is the most prestigious gastronomic contest in the entire world. (intense music) (applause) (cheering) - I was chosen to be a judge on the new national selection. It was a logical decision. I had just been there. I had some idea of what they're looking for. I had gone through the process. I can look at chefs and see where the strengths and weaknesses are. Particularly towards Bocuse d'Or. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Three minutes grace period to finish up, and it looks like he's almost there. It felt a little bit strange to be on the other side of the table for the tasting of the next Canadian Selection. But it felt great to see some other chefs that were excited about competing in The Bocuse d'Or. I was looking for the chef that had potential and really wanted it. - Samuel Sirois. (cheering) (applause) - I really hope that I have laid some ground work for the next candidate and future teams, that we've inspired other Canadian chefs to compete at this level. It's very important for us. We wanted to make sure that we weren't in it just for this two-year period. Because we know that in order for us to really move up the ranks we have to build the team, but also nurture what we've already worked on. (whooping) (quiet music) - It was so demanding and so all consuming. I'm so grateful to be a part of it. Every time I came to train here and work with this team of people I was learning something new. And I was so grateful for that opportunity. My dream was always to learn as much as I could and Bocuse d'Or was a wonderful way for me to start that journey. - Paul Bocuse has left an extraordinary legacy for the culinary arts. He's a chef that everybody respects. The reason we can be thankful for him is that he was the one that wanted the chefs to get out of the kitchen and put them in the spotlight. - Paul Bocuse was one of my heroes. If he was here today I would just like to, I'd give him a big hug actually. And I'm not a huggie person. I'd give him a big hug and say, "Thank you for doing this." And for him to put the time and the effort. - If he was still here I would say, "Merci Chef. "Thank you for making this amazing competition "and for inspiring me and my team. "It's truly an honor to meet you." - Thank you Mr. Paul. There is so much you could say, but the biggest thing is thank you. Just because he ignited this force of gastronomy around the world and created this stage for chefs to tested on. And brought us out into the spotlight rather than just in the depths of the kitchen so, there's nothing else to say but thank you. (peaceful music) (light switch clicking) (upbeat music)
