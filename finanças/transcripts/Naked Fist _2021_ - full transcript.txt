Why did I end up like this? I was just an ordinary high school girl. In the near future, Neo-Senju sector, Neo-Tokyo. Deterioration of public order has forced each sector of Neo-Tokyo to form bands of vigilantes, one standing far above the rest. Just do it. What? No way. We're not dating. It's a date tomorrow. No. Shotaro is going to a casino park in Yokohama. I'm going with him. That's a good idea. You can go to the hotel and... Kiyo, what are you doing? I'm training. I want to go out with you. Look, Shotaro is watching. Don't look at me. It's embarrassing. Sorry, Kiyo. What's wrong? You said to knock before entering the room. I'm fine. I just fell. Dinner is ready. Do you want to eat? I'm going to eat at home. I'll give it to you. I'll eat it when I have time. What's this? Are you awake? Sorry. You want to rest at home on your day off. I'm glad you're with Akira. Really? I'm glad. We are in Neo Tokyo. We have a security guard. Please cooperate. To be continued They're the bad guys. Are you two a couple? We're working. I'm a consultant for a casino in Futo, Yokohama. I'm a member of a game company. What's this woman doing here? She's a partner. I only have one client. You're on a date. No, we're not. We're childhood friends. Childhood friends? That's suspicious. Check your belongings. You're full of motivation! Akira, why do you have that? No, Kiyo-chan bought it. It's against the Neo Tokyo Regulations. Let's do a physical examination. Kiyo, stop it. Wait a minute. Stop it. What are you hiding? Stop it. Stop it! Don't touch it with your dirty hands. Stop it. I'm looking for it. It's a violation of the law. Stop it. Stop it! Akira! Look at that. Stop it. What's that? Stop it! Don't look at it. Stop it. Stop it! What's this? No! Help me! The more you take off, the stronger you become. Hada family, here! Tetsuko, long time no see! I'll get rid of the traitor. Damn it! You're still as flashy as ever. You too. Stop playing the police. Wait. Dentsu. I've been here for a hundred years. I've been waiting for this day. I'll beat you today. Stop it! You're pretty good. You're reacting well. No, stop it! Stop it! Yesterday, the Tokyo Police Department announced that a mysterious white smoke in the Kawaguchi-Arakawa liner was a suspect in a terrorist attack on a self-propelled gun. A man was hospitalized for this incident. You're a terrorist? I saved you, but you're terrible. I'm sorry. I'm trying to hide the Jikei-dan's application by making me a bad person. I'm Tetsuko. What's your name? I'm Akira Yoshimura. You'd better hide here for a while. I think they're using your cell phone. Akira, run! Shotaro... Where did you take Shotaro? Oh, that man. I feel bad for him, but I have to accept it. No one came back from the incident. I have to talk to the police. You know the police are investigating the incident, right? In other words, they're an organization the police are working for. I'll just get caught. What will happen to Shotaro? Well... He'll be penalized for social service. He'll be sent to a tunnel or a nightclub. No way... Please help Shotaro. Can you get rid of the bad guys? I'm sorry, but I can't get rid of those three women. I'll pay you. I've been getting calls and emails. You're also a detective. I'll help if I can. Don't abandon Shotaro. Why are you so... Because of me, Shotaro... I want to help him. Please teach me the techniques you taught me. Like this. Or this. No way. That's not Aikido. Come to think of it, that time... Maybe... I can't... No, I can't. I've decided not to teach anyone else. But... I can teach him. Okay. If you pass the test, can I teach you? What did you do? What about the power of the train? What are you talking about? This is a crime against the law. Please call the police. That person is the police. Detective Yamagata of Nishi-Jujo-Sho. You said you would do anything for your boyfriend, even if you were naked. What is naked? That is the legendary sword. It was inherited from the Himiko era. It was made in the Edo era. It is a sword for women by women. It is the ultimate weapon that can make your partner crazy by combining 48 types of sex. What? I can't do that. You just put the stick in the hole. Sex is not a tool to fight or kill each other. It is a noble act to confirm love and give a new life. And I decided to devote my first love to Shotaro. Are you a daughter? When did you decide? Do you protect your girlfriend or your boyfriend? Which one? I can't decide. I thought you had a good sense of humor, but I guess I was wrong. I'll let you get away from Tokyo, so just be quiet and be nice. What? Mr. Yamagata, you're a detective, right? Can't you do something? No, no, no. The leader of the Jigeidan in Neo-Senzu District is the son of the head of the Honten Joso-ku. If I'm bad at this, I'm like this. Don't be so jealous. Oh, right. Let me introduce someone nice. Tomorrow... At noon... Come here. Be careful of them. Hello! Welcome to the Therapy Clinic Neo Tokyo JK! There are a lot of cute girls here! Please click the button! Welcome. Is there something you need? Well... Ah, you're the one who wants to be a student here. I've heard about you. Come on in. Wait a minute. Come on in. What? What is this? What are you doing? And you're a high school girl. Kaori, you look young. Thank you. Is this the girl who wants to be a student here? I'm the best student here. The best? What is this place? It's a reflection. We therapists heal your mind and body. Would you like to work with us? Is this why you called me? You're imagining things. There's nothing suspicious here. It's a business trip, so it's open. I'm going home. I was an idiot for expecting this. Wait, wait, wait. I get it. Let's talk about that later. Let's talk about that later. Hey, Dori. Let's talk. It's about the leader of the class. I heard from the guest. His name is Takashi Shikishima. He was a student who was the student council president. He was dumped because he couldn't stand the first sex. It was a trauma and he became a bad person. But he changed his mind. After he met a great woman. That woman is Tetsuko. They joined the class to protect the peace of the city. Tetsuko was a member of the class? But she couldn't keep up with Takashi's way. So Tetsuko left. She has her father's power. She can do whatever she wants. Do you know where Shotaro is? He was caught. He has a secret hideout. I told you not to touch it. It's none of your business. What are you doing? If you don't help me, I'll go to the police station alone. You've never been shot by your parents. You should be with your boyfriend. I can't just watch. Shotaro helped me. I'll change my life. You really want to help me? You're serious. Yes. Even if I die, I don't want to lose Shotaro. I decided not to tell anyone about this martial art. But when I see you, I feel like I'm seeing my sister. Is this your sister? Yes. We haven't seen each other for a long time, though. Hadaka Ken. The secret of the 48 moves. This is Hadaka-ken? Hon-ryu is a technique that is decided by the union of the man. But you are not like that. For example, I wonder if that little girl will be the last disciple. I was sure that I would come back here someday. Give it to me. Stop it! I'll do it! I'll beat you and become the number one. Interesting. I'll see how much you've grown. You can go now. No! No! No! No! No! No! Not yet! Fireworks! Stop! Stop! Watch carefully what happens if you go against the time bomb. This is the end. Tachimatsu Bomb! Tetsuko-san! Tetsuko! Tetsuko! Don't die! You betrayed the Jikei Corps. You're coming with us. Do you want to be like Tetsuko? Tetsuko said that naked swords were only a form of protection. But that's not true. They're the only way to make arrogant men eat iron. I want to show this technique to many women. Do you want to join us? No! Why would I want to help a Jikei Corps member? He's a man! He's not a man. Give it to me. No! Stop! Give it to me. Stop! Give it to me. Hey, stop! It's a precious document! Give it to me! Stop! Someone call the police! There's a murderer! Someone! Give it to me! Kei, if we find the killer, we're in trouble. Let's retreat for now. There's a back door. Okay. By the way, that boyfriend is already dead. He tried to escape. You should commit suicide soon. I'm sorry I'm late. It's my fault. Tetsuko and Shotaro... Tetsuko... Tetsuko was prepared for this. She won't regret it. The next day, Ryo Kawaguchi Sector, Ryo Saitama. I'm worried about you! You don't have a phone. Shotaro-san... Shotaro-san... I'll give you a massage. Are you sure? Dad, what are you doing? Akira! Oh, my. Akira, you're home. I delivered it. Don't get me wrong. It's just a normal massage. You're lying. You're wearing a back-up, aren't you? No, I haven't worn it yet today. Today? Not yet? Where have you been? Why do you know Kaori? I didn't know you were in such a shady place. It's not shady. You've been in charge of me more than 10 times. Anyway, stop making me hurt. What are you doing? Please forgive me. My mom ran away. Akira didn't come back from a date. I was lonely. I'm home. Shotaro died. I'm sorry, Akira. I shouldn't have let Kaori go to your house. I was wrong. You're right. Akira. The Geis are so mean. They have such a wonderful boyfriend. Akira. Akira, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Akira. Why are you crying? Akira! I have to go save Shotaro! Akira, don't push yourself. I have this. It's a memory of Tetsuko. It's like a Zenkai. It's different from what I saw. This. It's similar to the technique I use when I'm looking for a real one. This is a specialty. Akira might be able to teach me. Akira, you don't have to break the bookmark. You can beat your opponent. Tetsuko, you're trying to teach me this. Kaori, teach me the trick. Leave it to me. It's too soft to be used. What about this? It's hard but thin. Then, this. It's too big. It's a good shape. Yes. Use your lips and tongue to rub it. Yes, gradually speed up. Rub it hard! It's hard to be naked in winter. Hey! What is it? I'm going to have a meeting with a minister. Ouch! Stop it! Don't be so rough. Stop it! Oh, pizza's here. Hey. Hey! I'm opening it now! Do you want to get beaten up so badly? The more you take off your clothes, the stronger you become. No way... Hada Kaken, on the scene! That's not Hada Kaken. Do it. Ouch! Wait! Stop it! She's... Why did I end up like this? It was a normal high school girl's life. I did it! Can you use the Hadaka Sword? Half of the scroll is here. It's only a part of the technique. I've learned it in such a short time. But I'll show you the true power of the Hadaka Sword! Kei! Wait! Tetsuko! You're alive. I pretended to be dead. Good luck! Damn it! Not yet. Hold the boat! Hold on! Let's meet in hell, honey. You're the only one left. How are you going to defeat me? Can you break this steel pants? Where do you want to be? Shotaro, I'm begging you. It's not like I hate you! I've always admired you. I always wanted to be with you! Then why didn't you tell me? Because you're above all of this. That's not true! I've always wanted to be with you! Shotaro, please help me! I'm so embarrassed, I'm going to cry! I love you! I love you so much! I want to hold you! I want to be there for you! I won't let you do this! I see. So that's what it was. A beautiful body, a warm heart, and a hidden power. Now, I'll be the first to be seen. A flower's shame. I'm a maiden. I'm a girl, so I'm a maiden. I will punish you with shame. Is that Chidori's song? No, it's Karinokubi's. What happened? Akira bit me! What? I protected you! Okay. Oh no! Tetsuko! You're kidding! Look at this. Don't worry, O-Ten. I'm still alive. But they're coming. Run! Tetsuko's sister, Nio. Come with me. We'll help you. Mashiko! I'm going to introduce myself. I'm Amatsuka Moe, playing Tetsuko. I'm Komaki Mako, playing Yoshimura Aki. I'm a plank member of the Koshidaka-gumi Haraka-ken. I'm a member of the Koshidaka-gumi Haraka-ken. I'm a member of the Koshidaka-gumi Haraka-ken. I'm a person who forgets things easily. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Did you get hit? I'm fine. I'm totally fine. How was it? After the first day. I think it went well. Today, I was shooting with Tetsuko-san. I've been shooting since this morning. I had a lot of fun with Yamagata-san. He is a unique and interesting person. I was being stared at. I was watching you. Didn't it hurt? It didn't hurt. He hit me beautifully. There are a lot of physical fights from the first day. That's right. I think it's good. If we have this kind of thing, we can do it more and more. If we have it on the first day, the distance will be shortened. We can get along with each other. We can do it without holding back. I think we can have fun together. I'm a little excited. How was Amatsuka-san's impression? She is a very kind sister. She was wearing a cold-looking outfit from the beginning. She worried about me and said, It's cold. Are you okay? I think I'm going to get used to it.
