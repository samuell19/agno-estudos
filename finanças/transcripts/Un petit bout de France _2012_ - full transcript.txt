Paris - Ministry of the Interior February 12, 1981 If France were a village, it would be Saint-Ferréol. 5,502 inhabitants. A 16th century church... Its patron saint is Saint Sebastien. Its traditions, its cuisine. I'm too busy for tourism. So are you. Saint-Ferréol has something for you. What? Chocolate spread, sausage dumplings? No, no. Since universal suffrage began with the 1962 presidential election... First geography, then a history lesson! Let him finish. So, since 1962, Saint-Ferréol votes exactly like the rest of France. Meaning? Take the results from the 1965 election: De Gaulle, 55.2%, Mitterrand, 44.8%. Saint-Ferréol was the same. 1969 election, same thing. May 1974... I know: Giscard, 58%, Mitterrand, 42%. Not quite. Giscard, 50.8%, Mitterrand, 49.2%. Just like Saint-Ferréol. My God! - Aren't you going to finish? - Yes. So... OK... If France were a village, it would be Saint-Ferréol. A LITTLE PIECE OF FRANCE Passengers arriving from Tanzania please go to gate 1. Vincent! Yoo-hoo, Vincent! Wow, a 23 hour trip! I'm exhausted. We had the longest layover in Singapore. It's great to see you. It's freezing. Is this your dad's car? It's the ministry's car. Gilles offered to come get you. "Gilles"? - Vincent, Gilles. - Hello. The ministry's got nice cars. CX Athena Pallas, hydropneumatic suspension, 4 cylinders. Can we go? I have a lunch. I can't be late. I'm getting a sweater. Bring your bag inside. Let's go. - Who's he? - Dad's technical advisor. That explains it. So? Did you finish your thesis? I have a copy here. 242 pages, 6 months of work. Let's see. What's it about? Matrilineal exogamy in tribes of northern Tasmania. It's ethnology. How's that pay? What do you think? People continue to react to Jacques Chirac's official announcement of his candidacy to the presidential election, while President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is not yet running. So just like that, they threw you out? "Out"? No, Dad. While he was gone, they found another roommate. So they threw him out. What do you plan on doing, young man? He can sleep here, René. We'll find him a room. Yes. Just a few days. "A few days." Oh, well... The kids' room? Eh? The kids' room is nice. How long has it been since you ate? I told you. See? It worked. It's a little tight for both of us. But your dad seems nice. I thought he hated me. Oh, he does. But he's polite. Oh, yeah? Well, your mom loves me. - And you? - Not here, not now. Did you tell them? There's no point until you get a job. They don't know? Mom suspects, but Dad thinks you're a college friend. I even told him you were gay. You'll see if I'm gay! Are you coming, Alice? Johnny Carson is starting. Let your friend sleep. He must be exhausted. - Right? - Yes, Ma'am. Let's go. - Good night, Vincent. - Good night. The town's make-up is as follows: Majority right. UDF, 28%, RPR, 13%. On the left: Socialists, 25%, Communists, 17%. Ecologists, right and left parties share the rest, without forgetting the 15% who want Coluche. As you can see, Saint-Ferréol is a mirror image of France. Fauquier, did you find this? Yes, Mr. Minister. On accident. A village that reflects national opinion. It's providence. Imagine what we can do with this. Better than poll institutes, which no one trusts, Minister. Rightly so. Since Chirac's announcement, traitors are everywhere. He's got his people planted to fudge numbers. Gentlemen, we are entering an era of score settling and treachery. But if, thanks to this hamlet, we get exact, trustworthy, exclusive opinion figures before the polling institutes, we'll have an edge on the opposition and we can react in time. We need someone we can trust for this mission. - I may have someone. - Yes. Isn't it too short? It's breezy. No, it looks good. Long hair is out, anyway. The moustache, too. You look like a man. That's what worries me. A tie, really? You're never happy. Gilles got you a job, and you whine. I know, you'd rather go back to Tasmania. With you, yes. Come on, try. Take it. When it's over, you'll have won my dad over. Here it is. "Saint-Ferréol." Plant a thermometer there, take France's temperature. Incredible, huh? This'll earn you points with Alice's dad. What do you mean? - Alice really likes you. - Oh, yeah? In her family, you need 10,000 F per month to count. How much do I get? A lot. Here's the first month. You'll get the same every month. - In cash? - As you can see. The operation code name is "Swallow", your name is Thermometer. "Thermometer"? Why Swallow? For spring. Here. A fake poll institute card to back your story. Remember, the minister wants results every day. Is all this legal? The less you know, the better. Any questions? Do you have an envelope? Alice is a cute girl, huh? She's got good taste. Did she pick the suit? Yes. The tie, too. - Are you ready? - Almost. Mom thinks you're cute, with short hair. If your girlfriend's mom likes you, that's half the battle. Don't forget me. Alice, this was your idea. I know. I got you a present. - What is it? - Open it. It's a Walkman. I made a tape, so you remember me. I know it's silly, but... No. No, it's not silly at all. It's... It's very sweet. You're great. Thank you. Alice, Dallas is on! Does she do this on purpose? Wait. Alice! You bastard. He's back from Tanzania and you send him to the abyss. I gave him a job, money and a reason to live. And you found the village, anyway. We had to send someone. It was quite the find. I knew Fauquier'd come around. It wasn't easy. But I think he's glad to get him far away. And her? I'm in Fauquier's good graces, but her... I don't know what to do. You've seduced the father. The daughter's a detail. It's 1981, Patrick. Not the Middle Ages. I'm not so sure about the Fauquiers. Your rival is gone. It's in your court. See you. Saint-Ferréol train station February 25, 1981 Saint-Ferréol, OK? Guerilla FM, resistance radio. What kind of radio is this? Guerrilla FM, free radio. Pirate radio, here? That's illegal. If the left wins, they'll free up radio. In 20 years, State TV and radio will be prehistoric. The rich will be less rich, the poor less poor, we'll work less, we'll be happier. You seem like you like politics. Could you answer a questionnaire? A questionnaire about what? Questions. For example: "Who has the best chances "of being elected president? "Georges Marchais, François Mitterrand, "Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Chirac, Arlette Laguiller..." Why should I answer? Are you part of the 18% who abstain from voting? Yeah, sure. Hello. - Hello. - Sir. I have a room reserved for Vincent Desmouliers. Follow me. Catherine, a customer. - Hello. - Hello. - What name? - Desmouliers, Vincent. "Desmouliers." Desmouliers... Yes. In room 8. Second floor. Go on up, I'll come. - End of the hallway. - Thanks. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit! It's me. I've got clean towels. Thank you. Say, a young girl in town with an R5 does she ring a bell? You know, me with cars... An R16? No. An R5. "R5"... What color? I don't know. Brown, red, orange. She's a brunette, a rock chick. "Rock"? You know, me, with music... Are you interested in the car or the girl? Hôtel Central, yes? Vincent Desmouliers, please. - Hello? - Vincent? - Alice? - It's me. - Oh, Alice! - What are you doing? I'm settling in. Unpacking. - Thinking about me? - Uh... Vincent? Of course I am. I was just listening to your tape. So you're settled? How's your room? My room? It's... well... It's ugly. The wallpaper is tacky, the lamp is awful. Not to mention the bathroom. Sociologically it's interesting. If you have a symbolically social approach, you interact with the local population... Stop with your ethnologist jargon. - Sorry. - He annoys me, too. Tacky bathroom? Wait. "A symbolic approach" on the... - This Parisian is crazy. - I've not started. I have a meeting at city hall. Your job is important, you know. Yes, I know. But 2 months here, far from you... But it's for a good cause. It's for us. Yes. You're right. We'll talk tomorrow. OK? OK. Good night, baby. Good night. - OK. Hang up. - No, you first. - No. You. - Hang up. - I always hang up. - No. OK, on 3. One, two, three. I told you we had to repaint. So it's my fault! Close up. I'm going to bed. Bye, Gilbert. The bathroom... Gilbert, we're closing. We're closing! Come on. Mitterrand for President Leave us alone! We're for Chirac. We need Jacques Chirac POLICE STATION Were you robbed? No. I don't get it. You're not reporting a theft? No. A loss. Of an R5. A Walkman that I lost in an R5. - A Volkman. - A Walkman. OK? It's like a portable tape player. So I want to find the R5. OK. Listen, young man. There are tons of R5's. You know it's the car of the year. So we're not going to launch a search party to find a missing Volkman. Of course. I won't see you out. Sir! - Sir, please! - Yes? Sorry about the sergeant. He's on edge. He's looking for a pirate radio. - That's why. - OK. Here's a list of car registrations for R5s. Thanks, that's really nice. Don't mention it, it's confidential. OK. Why are you doing this? We're not all pigs, sir. Thank you. Culture is a priority for City Hall. - Agriculture, you mean. - No puns. Your school will have its library. We'll make the decision after the election. You won't be here after that, Mr. Mayor. Remember municipal elections aren't until 1983, and until then, you're still the opposition. - Good day, Brissonnier. - Good day, Mr. Mayor. - Mr. Mayor? - Yes? What? We have a meeting. I'm from Sofres polling. Oh yes, that's right. I forgot. Come in. Listen, sir. I won't keep you waiting. I can't find it. My secretary's organizational habits are mysterious. I have no idea where she put the key. Do you really need the voter registries? Well, yes. I need them for my report for the Ministry. "The Ministry"? What Ministry? Aren't you with Sofres? Yes. No... Uh... Will she be here later? Who? Your secretary. I doubt it. She's in bed with a fever of 102. I tried to call, but it's busy. She took it off the hook. Anyway... Keep me posted. I'm at Hôtel Central. And I'll just do without today. Goodbye. Has he left? Yes, but he'll be back. He seems harmless. Didn't you hear? He's from the Ministry. Why do you think he's here? I don't know. But he can't stay. I'd like to see him on the 1st train to Paris. You get my drift? No. Maryse, please try. He needs to see he's not welcome. Isn't your brother into boar hunting? Hello. Vincent Desmouliers, I'm with Sofres. Do you have a positive or negative view of the left? Negative. - Yeah. - Mostly favorable. For the left? Yes, comrade. Yes. We need change, the left. - I'll put negative. - No, it's a misunderstanding. I support the left. Ah. So I'll put positive. Very good. Does your younger sister sometimes drive your R5? No. Thank you. Goodbye. Do you know the people who own those R5s? Thank you, sir. Hello. Ministry of the Interior. Hi. Office 2624, please. Hold on. I'll transfer you. Yes? Hello. Vincent Desmouliers. - The code? - Operation Swallow. - Name? -Thermometer. The stats? For popularity on a scale from 1 to 10, 12 eights, 7 nines, 6 sixes. Yes. - Noted? - Yes. I don't get it. Thermometers... - 7 nines. - Figures, percentages. It must be a code. - You think? - Yes. And for: "What candidate would you be friends with?" For candidate 1, we have a satisfaction rate of 57, for candidate 2, 82. "82"? - Are you sure? - Yes. - Is there a problem? - I don't like it. No. I'll call back. - Hôtel Central. - Room 8. Yes. Room 8, I'll transfer you. - It's the girl. - Hello, Vincent? It's the girl.. Oh! It's the girl. Are you OK? Yes, yes. Everything's good. I reported the stats. I don't know what for. The polls aren't based on a reliable calculation. - How so? - It's not important. Don't worry. Hello? What's that? Is it the line? We can't do this. We'll be caught. What's he doing with the voter registry? He's shady. I'm telling you. Shady. More reason to listen. We should know. It's our right. - I'll do another area tomorrow. - Sleep well. Hi. I'm Vincent Desmouliers, with Sofres, for the presidential election. Who's most likely to win? Georges Marchais, Arlette Laguiller, Huguette Bouchardeau, François Mitterrand, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Chirac, Michel Crépeau, Brice Lalonde... - Michel Colucci. - Thank you, sir. François Mitterrand, I think. "Mitterrand"... I don't care. - Giscard d'Estaing... - I don't care. Jean-Marie Le Pen, Michel Colucci, aka Coluche... François Mitterrand. Mitterrand, of course! "Mitterrand"? Very well. Thank you, sir. - Good bye. - Good day. Pascal Gauchon? Jean-Marie Le Pen? Ah! Blank ballot? Abstention? - Abstention? - No. No? What do I put down? OK. I'll put down... Thank you, sir. Polls, polls... I don't believe polls. It's like the weather. They're wrong. Hi, girls. A pint. All these polls... They ask such weird questions. Where is he going with the R5 thing? - Yeah. - He reminds me of someone. The other jerk who wanted to buy our Saint Sebastian for 150 francs. - The priest! We got him drunk. Remember? He was 3 sheets to the wind. Otherwise, he wouldn't have confessed. That's one way to know what the Parisian's up to. He's cute, isn't he? She likes him! Hello, Vincent. - Oh, hi! - How are you? Fancy a drink? It's on the house. Come on, just one, Vincent. Oh, come on! Ah, Gilles! Did you see the results? Yes, why? You're asking why? It's just a 1st estimate. The left is gaining ground, this is new, at these numbers. - It's a 1st report. You sold me this as a miniature model of France. If the minister sees it he'll say the model is moving left. - Has he seen it? No. We have a meeting tomorrow afternoon. - Oh? - You're coming, too. But until then... I don't want to be accused of cover-ups. His office, tomorrow, 3:30. Good. Hey! To ethnology. Yes. Is it good? No. I'll explain. Matri... Mat... Matrilineal exogamy is when you can't marry your cousin. Really? That's ethnology? Yes. So if I marry my cousin, it's ethnology? No. You didn't get it. - Jean-Paul... - No. I'm Léon. - Jean-Paul, that's... - I'm Jean-Paul. You aren't making sense. Wait. Another round. That'll clear it all up. It's over. Done. No, no. I have work. We're in Saint-Ferréol. In Saint-Ferréol, we drink. - Last one. - Come on, come on! Go! Go! Go! Go, Vincent! Yeah! - Bravo. - OK. Goodbye. - Good night. - Yes, good night. My briefcase. - Good night, Vincent. - Good night. So, he's not a bad dude. He's a good guy. But I don't believe the polls. - It's like the weather. - You said that. - And? - And he's hammered. Eh, Gilbert? Gilbert! He's hammered, eh? Yes, yes, go ahead. Drink alone. They did it last night. We didn't hear anything. I just repainted the shutters. Who's after me? They're mad at him. What did I tell you? It was a shotgun. - I don't like hunting. - Me either. - It's 8. - No. 12. Let me see. How can you tell? They're bigger. Good morning. What's going on? Didn't you hear? - What? - That! Is hunting Parisians a local custom? No, but still. You can't stay here. We don't know who did it. Catherine, please. I can't go. I have to finish a job here. Tell him, Gérard. He doesn't get it. - What don't I get? - You can't stay. We like you but it's risky. We're not heroes. I can see that. I see that. OK. Prepare my tab. - Yes? - Ah, Vincent. I was afraid you'd left. I've got big news. - Me, too. - Me, first. - Go ahead. - I saw Sophie last night. I told her we wanted to live together. She might have a place for us. Oh, yeah? Isn't it great? Yeah. Great. What does your dad think? Don't worry about him. I'm proud of you. When you're back, I'll tell him. Promise. Seeing you at work will change his mind, I'm sure. You think? I promise. My mom thinks so. - She does? - Yes. Aren't you glad? Yes, yes. Your voice is weird. No, no. And what did you have to tell me? Huh? Nothing. I love you. He loves her. Who cares? Your soap operas going to your head. It's starting to... Maybe. But love changes everything. A coffee, please. No. A cognac. You're staying? I'm not leaving. We told you, Vincent. You can't stay. I can't stay? We'll see about that. I spent over 6 months in the jungle, with leeches, scorpions, snakes, and cannibals. And you want me to go because someone shot at my shutters? Well, yes. No. - What will you do? - Tell the police. You think that's normal. But I won't back down. "The police"? Wait, sir. The police... That's a bad idea. Don't worry. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. What do you know? Maybe they're not after you. So... the shutters? Here. I'll give it to you. Do what you want. But I'm warning you. If this happens again, I'll complain. Thanks for the cognac. Is he going to the cops? CITY HALL I promise, this isn't on purpose. Drat, where did I put it? It was here, on my secretary's medical certificate. It's OK. I believe you. But my job is hard without the registries. So if you ever find the key, let me know. - Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Good bye. Hello. Vincent Desmouliers, with Sofres. Mitterrand. Yes. For an opinion poll on the election. Who is most likely to be president? Georges Marchais, Arlette Laguiller, Brice Lalonde, François Mitterrand, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Chirac... - Valéry... - François Mitterrand. Uh... Marchais, yeah. Marchais. Very well, sir. - Good bye. - Bye. Have a nice day. Hello. Vincent Des... My Walkman! - Hello. - Hello. I was about to sell it. I'll get it. You still don't want to answer my questions? - No. - Thanks. - I listened to it. There's some good stuff. - I made a copy, is that OK? - Sure. - Are we cool? - Yes. If you want. Thank you. I could maybe even buy you a drink. - To thank you. - Why not? I won't say it's serious at this point. But we can't ignore this warning. - Do you agree? - Absolutely. I was going to broach it after the Council of Ministers. But it's urgent. Margaux, what do you think? Do we all agree, for once? The statistics lesson is implacable. Until Giscard throws his hat into the ring, the center's a vacuum. The voters have stated they will vote where they can. In this case, the left. It's "anything but Chirac" syndrome. We have to be clear with the president: "Start campaigning." Did you talk to him? That's your job. Operation Swallow is your baby. Mine? Listen, Mr. Minister,... Relax. I'll do it. I don't understand your story. The mayor's secretary isn't sick in bed. She's my neighbor. She was fine today. Maybe she lied to the mayor. Maybe the mayor's lying. Why would he do that? What's on these voter registries? There's one way to know but it's not your style. What's my style? I don't know... Serious. And what's your idea? Have you done this before? - I'll try the other office. - Watch out. Didier? Yes? What do you think about that nosey pollster? Pollster? What pollster? What do you mean? You're the mayor. Don't you know? Everyone's talking. You're not listening to the people. I have a council for that. The mayor is above the fray. Don't start, you two. No politics tonight. It won't be easy. I'm addicted. If my deputy provokes me, even in jest, the claws come out and I bite. Come on, Didier. Your deputy's for Chirac but he's OK, especially when you cook dinner. Oh, stop. About dinner, it's almost ready. - Martine, let's sit down. - Wait. Didier! Seriously... These polls are the new big thing. I think it's a turning point in how we fight a campaign. It's even a turning point in politics. Why not in human history? Well yes. You might say that. In any case, it's dangerous. Soon the man on the street will be in charge. And I don't want him in my office! Well you're wrong. It's a good yardstick. Don't ignore the streets. And that pollster in Saint-Ferréol, you shouldn't overlook him. You're mad. Even is Giscard runs now for the polls it's got nothing to do with that kid. Come, see. What's going on? I have decided to run in the presidential election for a new term. I got them! I got them! OK. It's another false alarm. I'll speak with the mayor. Look! - They smashed the window. - Oh, wow. They might still be inside. Exactly. Shouldn't we go in? Yes, we go in. Go ahead. I'll cover you. Let's search the place. Clara? - Are you OK? - Yes. This stinks. Are you OK? CITY HALL It's a disaster. The voter registration is missing. Are you sure? - Look! - Mr. Mayor? Do you want to complain? No. No need. They didn't take anything. - No money, no documents? - Nothing, Sergeant. Uh, yes. My pencil sharpener. They didn't come for a pencil sharpener. It was probably just school kids. Not all young people are criminals. Though elections are times when insecurity is a major challenge. You're new, aren't you? Yes. Why? No reason. I won't keep you. - Maryse will tidy up. - Mr. Mayor. Gentlemen. We're in trouble, Maryse. What are we going to do? - Replace the window. - Well of course! Oh, that feels good. Have you found something? Nothing suspicious, anyway. I don't get it. Maybe Chastel wasn't lying. Yeah, right, he's a dirt bag. I saw Maryse. She wasn't sick. Ah, right... Sorry. My clothes are soaked. Don't be afraid. I won't jump on you. Maybe, but you never know. You're right. Don't be fooled by appearances. Especially when you take polls. Here, try this. I'll find some pants. You wear this? Yes, I wear that. In real life. Can I keep it? Here. Try the pants. France needs a president Your job can't be easy. You've gotta be smart to advise candidates. That's what you do, right? "Candidates"? How do you know that? That's what they say. Who says? Who? Alain Barsac, Deputy Mayor. - Am I bothering you? - Not at all. - You know you're a celebrity? - Me? Yes. Everyone here is talking about you. Really? Don't be modest. Polls are the future. You think so? I don't think so. I know so. Well, they're waiting for me. Catherine! Put it on my tab. - Yes. - It's on me. I'm organizing a reception at the garage, to attract my customers. Please come. Thank you but I have no time. You won't regret it, I assure you. - OK. Well, let's go. - Excuse me. You know what? If Barsac's interested, we should pamper him. You need a panel. I can help you. - Oh, yeah? - Get in. Did you push Giscard to run? Me? No, not at all. Don't screw around. But don't give us a Commie. - No... - Because when I hear about unions, I have a stroke. 35-hour work weeks, 5 weeks of vacation. Retirement at 60. You did well with Giscard. It'll help Chirac. That's for sure. For sure. Be quiet, please! Thank you for turning up to welcome our friend. I'd like to help him do his job by answering his questions. We'll clear the table, and everyone can do it. One at a time, single file, and quietly, if you can. You see? Didn't it go well? You saved time. I saved time, but... Chirac, Chirac, Chirac, Chirac... - Not a very diverse panel. - Not really. But that's reality. I'll buy you a Mexican beer. It's cold, it's light, it's appropriate. Cheers! Let's see. So... Giscard, 28, Mitterrand, 25. Marchais is dropping. Chirac, 13? He's up again. He was 11 last time. He's yo-yoing. Giscard runs and loses 3 points, Chirac picks them up. It's insane! Are you sure about your guy? - He has his methods... - With the quota method statistical error is almost zero. We did it in Saint-Ferréol. The sample corresponds to the reference population. So we can assume the numbers are right. - He's got a BA in ethnology? - A PhD. He's a nerd. - Put him on. - Who? - Your thermometer. - What? Yes, your pollster. Can we call him? Of course. About time! - Brice Lalonde. - OK. - Hôtel Central. - Mr. Vincent Desmouliers. From the Ministry of the Interior. Jean-Pierre Rives... You're listening to Guerrilla FM. - Hello, Thermometer? - What? It's the minister. - Hi, Mr. Minister. - Glad to talk to you. - It's the minister! - The famous one! Be quiet! He's asking about us! "About us"? Who, "us"? I don't know. You, you, me, him. Saint-Ferréol. These polls are a little disconcerting, aren't they? - We want to listen! - Shut up! He says we're France. - "We're France"? - Well, we're France. Our hopes depend on you, Sir. - Are you up to it? - Yes, of course. I hope so for your sake. - Goodbye, Mr. Desmouliers. - Goodbye, Mr. Minister. The minister said... Strasbourg, Nice, Monaco... - No? - Yes. He said Dijon, too. Don't believe it. All that, it's us, in Saint-Ferréol. Well, that's something, isn't it? We count for something! Stand together. I'll take a picture. Me, right now, I'm a political party. There's something to think about! I represent the people, too, unlike some people. Because I'm unemployed? You're annoying with your polls. Eh, Gérard? Did you know we were a model... How was it again? A miniature model of France. So Jean-Paul and his Commies at the factory, that's one party... We know who likes Giscard. And Chirac, too. They're on the council. No shame in Socialism! And who's Coluche in town? - It's Bob! - Does that bother anyone? We forgot something. 10% of people in France are gay. Where are the fags? Well, that's Bob! - Say that again? - No, Bob! - Fuck you! - Bob, calm down! Bob! Calm down, Bob! What happened last night? A protest? We modeled France. It was a good laugh. - Latte? - Sure. Look! Thanks to you. We're famous, Vincent! "Saint-Ferréol, the thermometer". I don't get it. How do you know? I don't know, they wrote it. The reporter... Well, he's a reporter. - Are there photos? - Yes! There's one. "Hôtel Central"! We're proud. Do you want to switch rooms? 12 is free. I'll make you a latte. No need. My room is fine. 12 is the suite. The bathroom in 8 isn't so great. The lamp is bad, too, the wallpaper... I'm used to it. Don't insist. He says he's fine. Anyway, 12 isn't free. - Are people coming? - No, my collection. Her collection! Catherine collects photo romances. You know? How many are there? 30 years of subscriptions, 30 boxes. Wow... - Hi, Gilbert! - Hi, Gilbert. Your voice seems better. You sound good. Yeah, for some reason, my popularity ratings are booming. I swear. They wanted to give me the suite, the luxury suite, like the Ritz. You're popular in Paris, too. Dad says the minister talks about you. - You should have seen Gilles... - He's there? Yes. He had to look at a file with Dad. And he invited me to lunch. - Did you say yes? - Yes. Why? Is that not OK? No, but I think... - He's jealous - Yes! - She's messing with him. - No. She loves him. And he's a nice boy, Vincent. A little weird, but... "Nice boy"... That doesn't mean anything. - ...calf's head. - He ate calf's head... - And he hates it! - Oh, shit! - He needs books. - What? - Books! - Hang up! - Hi, Bob. Catherine, Sylvie... - Hi. Hi, Gérard. Hi, Gilbert. Twice in one week? You're a regular now! - Is your guest here? - Room 8. Thank you. - Do you still love me? - Yes. Someone's at the door. I'll call you back. Bye. Have a good lunch. Yes? I hear you do your rounds on foot. I've got something better. A car. - That's nice. - No, it's normal. It's the garage car. You might as well use it! A Talbot Horizon. It's on the square. It's all gassed up. - Thank you but... - But what? You want something bigger? I have a GS Pallas. I don't drive. I've got something. Why are you doing this? Well, I like you. And to be honest, Chastel should retire. Municipal elections are in 1983. The town needs a new direction. Someone like me. - See what I mean? - I see. You and I are cut from the same cloth. We can help each other. How so? With your influence at the ministries. Excuse me? Your influence at the ministries. Thanks for lunch. Alice, I... I know what you're gonna say. You know the answer. Please don't insist. The meal was delicious, the wine was great, but that's it. You're harsh. No. Honest. Stop! - I'm not interested. - 2 seconds... No. I don't want it. Hi. I'm looking for 91-B. It doesn't exist. 91 is the last number on this street. Do Mr. and Mrs. Philippe live here? If they're here, they sure are quiet. - Want to look under my bed? - Sorry. Come in. You wanted to see me. Hurry up. I've got a flight to Strasbourg. Mr. Minister... It's a little awkward. I got information on Operation Swallow. Go on. I don't have time to waste. Well, you know the operation is funded by the ministry. - This is not news. - Of course, but Fauquier sent his future son-in-law. Are you saying he started this just to get his son-in-law a job? It's shocking. I know Fauquier. I've known him 30 years. Aren't you the in-law? No. I didn't want to get involved. "Get involved?" Look what I got. Saint-Ferréol: France's Thermometer We should look into this thermometer. Thanks. I'll handle it. Bring Fauquier in... right away. The president we need He's not giving up! What can we do? We can't... Can we? No! We can't. We just can't. - Excuse me. - Yes. Whatever.. No. We can't. Say, Fauquier. I've known you a long time. Are you sure about your colleague? - Which one? - The MBA. Oh, Gilles. What about him? I'd get rid of him, if I were you. Really? Why? Let me explain. Sir, please? I'm looking for the Simonins. - I don't know them. - Oh? Émile Precy? - Michel Chabot? - No. - Solange Miguet? - No. Where do they live? Someone's messing with you, or my donkeys have the right to vote. He's asleep. Vincent, it's us! I have the key. I have the key! I brought you books. When your temperature drops, you'll get a government job. Would you like more calf's head? Do you recognize me? I'm the school principal. I found you on the road. They think your scooter was sabotaged. I don't know who's after you. - Leave me alone. - What? Leave me alone. What's wrong with you? - Calm down. - No, I won't. Get out. I can't do favors. I'm a thermometer. What did you think? Control the thermometer, control the temperature? He's delirious. - Out! - I'm sick of it. I can't see them. - Alice? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Clara. - Nice to meet you. - How was the trip? - Very long. When the left wins, the trains will run on time. Yes, of course. Did Vincent ask you to come? Yes. I'll take you to the hotel, we'll go get him later. Just a moment Just a story Just a happy love Nice, huh? I like this song. Me, too. It was on Vincent's tape. I copied it. Is that his shirt? Yeah... I didn't have clothes after I showered. That was a crazy day. Did he tell you? No. He must have forgotten. You'll be comfortable here. Your wallpaper is charming. You think? - Are we in the right room? - Yes, yes. No... well, yes! It's the right room. My wife mixed up the laundry. She "mixed up the laundry"? The next train to Paris. "Paris"? You can get to the station if you hurry... The next train to Paris is tomorrow. Very, very late. There's nothing tonight. Yeah. You're pale. Do you want a drink? What's wrong? What is it? It's disgusting, Mom! I left everything to come here! Can you imagine? After the fight with Dad, he'll never see me again. I sacrificed everything for Vincent. Stop. It's nosy. We can't let her leave him! - It's not our business! - Let's warn him. She won't listen. She's in the room. What did I do? Gérard says it's because of the bra. What "bra"? The one I washed, it was in your laundry. It's not mine, it's Clara's. Well I guessed that! That's the problem. What are you waiting for? Get Clara. Alice, it's Clara. Alice? Open up. Let's talk. There's nothing between Vincent and me. And the bra? His shirt? Let me in, I'll explain. OK. Listen... I like Vincent, but... - Can you hear? - It's not what it seems. Are they talking? I'm not interested. I'm not into... - I can't hear. - Quiet! ...men. Don't say anything. Quiet! I can't hear! If people in Saint-Ferréol find out... - Are you mad? - No, it's OK. Alice! I'm sorry. I'm ridiculous. I love you. - I've got news. - Me, too. - Dad knows about us. - You told him? No, but he knows. What did he say? I don't remember. It seems like you're better. Knock it off or I'll ask the young lady to go. I found something huge. What? Voter registry, Saint-Ferréol So? - We've got work to do. - OK. - Do you need me? - Yes. get in. I'll explain. Sorry to ask again. Is there a 91-B? I'm telling you, no one lives there. There is no 91-B. Someone asked me a few days ago. Thank you, then. How many is it? - 88. - 88 addresses, damn! 88 fake voters, that's 88 fake votes for the mayor. Now I see why he was hiding the registry. That's not all. It'll take us all day. - Mr. Precy? - He isn't here, either. I already told the guy who came before. No one is there, except the donkeys. Look. - And? - 208! 208 fake voters! Vincent was right. - We have to do something. - But what? - Grass on the mayor. - How? - The radio. - What one? This one! Guerilla FM. - Will they do it? - We can try. They're my friends. - OK? Is it working? - Yeah, OK. - Do we air the list? - No. Rock is the revolt. We're not political. It's not our thing. I disagree. Free radio isn't just a juke-box to play music. I agree. Radio is resistance. Whatever! We support abstention. One for all, they all suck! One for all, they all suck! You're sick. Shun the election! Shun the election! Who wants to air the fake voter registry? You're not gonna say anything? We'll let you hash it out. God dammit, you're not saying anything! - Exactly... - Screw you! On in 1 minute. Quiet, I'm turning on the mike. Is this your first free radio? How long are they gonna argue? Well... - We've got company. - Shit. The cops! The cops! - Fuck, the cops! - Stop! Turn it off! They wanna shut us up. Fight the aggressors! Stay strong, and proud of our message. OK. Once again. Full name and address. You won't shut us down. We're young, and youth is the future, change. Young lady, in 20 years your future will be the past. You'll all be old. So, full name and address. - When the left is... - Enough! Knock it off. We should have shut you down a month ago. They'd found you but we were too lenient. So, full name and address. - You can't touch us. - Oh, yeah? My friend's dad is a minister. Yeah right. Well... she didn't really lie. He's not a minister, he's cabinet chief. - Which ministry? - The Interior. That's no good. Why did you check? We would have kept them overnight and it would all work out. - But... - Well, now... No, but... - A problem? - Yes, "a problem"! With your stupidity... Yes! My daughter's locked up with a bunch of anarchists! People will talk. Come get me, we'll go to Saint-Ferréol. Of course, right away! Idiot! - What's going on? - Oh, no... No. Idiot! René... You like my daughter? Well I... You knew she was dating the thermometer? Absolutely not. Sure. How did you decide to send him away? Your daughter told me he had the right skills. And he did, didn't he? Even if the stats aren't what we hoped for... What would you do in my situation? I... Resign. It's always better than being fired. And you... With your resume you can work for the right or left. Who do you think I am? I'm advising. I'm technical advisor, Sir. - I'm just giving technical advice. - Get out. - Sorry? - Get out! You've got no morals and no balls. I don't want to see you. How do I get back to Paris? Don't you have an MBA? Figure it out. - I didn't do anything wrong! - Please stop yelling. Do you know what you've done? - You don't understand. - What do you understand? Pick a better boyfriend. Your Vincent has cost me my job. You hear me? He's gonna get me fired. - He's a great guy. - Yeah, right! - His stats are crap. - It's not his stats. It's the calculation. The registry's rigged. - What? - Nothing. You don't care. - Look it up. - Shut up! Look what up? Hey! I'm not done here! Shut the door. The door! Look what up? If it's true, the differential changes everything. Even if all Chirac's votes go to Giscard, the left is ahead? It's a catastrophe. It's math. If Saint-Ferréol represents France, the left will win. What proves you're right? Let him talk for once. 208 fake voters for 5,502 residents, what percent is that? I don't know. I do: 3.8%. And for 55 million French people? Cut to the chase! Over 2 million. "2 million"? Oh, shit! Listen. My work is done. Here. This one's still working. I've got to go. I have a meeting with the town union. Come in. Mr. Mayor. To what do I owe the honor...? I'm sorry but we have a rather delicate task. - "A task"? - We have a judge's order for a warrant to... - Gentlemen... Do your job. Excuse me, where is she? - Who? - Maryse. Maryse Gaillardon, your secretary. Is she here? "Maryse" ? What do you want with Maryse? I'm sorry, there's a witness saying she sabotaged Mr. Desmouliers' tires. - In a criminal act. - Yes. She's charged with mischief and endangerment. Maryse? No... Didier... Can you give us a few minutes? Quickly. I did it for you. I was so afraid. I couldn't watch you lose. Be strong. Don't worry. I'll get you out. And if they ask... If they ask questions, make something up! - Will you visit me? - Yes. Didier, will you forget me? - Come on... - Say it! Say it, please. We have to go, sir. Let's go, Ma'am. Please. Well... Well. That's over. What do you want? - To get married. - Huh? To get married. - Right now? - Right away. Here? No, impossible... One of you has to live here for a month, I need your birth certificates, you need a marriage license, a waiting period... Yes... Of course... we can make a deal. Congrats! Take a photo. Don't give me orders! - I don't know how it works - Let me do it. So, Mr. Fauquier? You're on the front lines. What's happening? On the front lines, you get shot first. Do you think the left can win? It's possible. If any Communists are elected, I'm leaving France. I don't want to be invaded by Russians. Pack your bags. Everyone say cheese! Saint-Ferréol, May 9, 1981 One more. For the newlyweds! Get in the car! Bye, Vincent. Tell us! Is it the left or right? I don't know. We can't know in advance. But you know with the polls. No, the polls are... Coming through! Do you have a light? Of course. Here. - Thanks. - Thanks. It's a nice night, isn't it? Unexpectedly. I didn't think it would be so cool... Do you dance? No. Not to this music, not... really... Oh, come on. I'll teach you. Come on. Alright. Everything OK? Well? - Left or right? - Yeah... Voted. - Hello. - Hello. 501. Mr. Alain Barsac. Voted. It is Sunday, May 10, 1981, 2nd round of the election. We are bearing witness to a decisive moment. In just a few seconds... - Have your parents left? - Yes. Of course! Dad had to go back to vote. Quiet! ...in France. With most ballots in... Cathy, you missed the start! Yes, yes. Sorry. We await the results. - You will have it right on time. - 10 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... François Mitterrand is president. It's a revolution. Yeah! Say something. You seem indifferent. - Do you like the provinces? - What? Thanks to our son-in-law's polls, I was able to anticipate the results, and I've been promised a charming prefecture... in Doubs. François Mitterrand has been elected president of France. - Thanks. - Who wants wine? We're out of champagne. Where are my turtle-doves? No idea. Where are the turtle-doves? How can we know? They're not on the phone! Mr. Mayor? Gentlemen? Did we have a meeting? No. So...? So come with us. Maryse? Is it Maryse? That bitch... We can't smooth this over, can we? Yeah... OK. Let's go. Please.
