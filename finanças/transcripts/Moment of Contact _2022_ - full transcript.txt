[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [RADIO STATIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Varginha is a Brazilian city located in the southern region of the state of Minas Gerais. Varginha is considered the seventh best city in Brazil to live and invest and became known internationally in 1996 for the alleged appearance of alien creatures, the episode that became known as the "Varginha Incident". This following story is based on truth and lies. [PLANE ENGINE REVS] [RADIO STATIC] [TAPE RECORDER WHIRRING] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [REPORTER SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] If true, call it another Roswell, if you will. That is, a crashed vehicle that had beings on board, apparently. Can she say what feelings she got from the creature? [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] AJ GEVAERD: The Varginha case is considered the most well-kept secret in the military circle of Brazil. [PLANE ENGINE REVS] JAMES FOX: We're in Sao Paulo, Brazil, about to go and investigate the infamous 1996 Varginha UFO incident. An alleged crash and reported bodies. So we're gonna go see... Oh, okay. No problem. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] I'm basically trying to figure out what took place in Varginha, Brazil, January 1996. Many people say there was a UFO crash, debris and bodies recovered. My objective here in Brazil is to find out, put some clarity on, what happened and where this debris ultimately ended up. [REPORTER SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] I wanna hear from her. NARRATOR: James Fox teams up with Brazilian researcher Marco Leal, who has been investigating the Varginha case since 2006. Together they meet Cynthia Covo in Sao Paulo, to go over the case. - So... - Yeah. This is the daughter of one of the most famous - UFO researchers in all of Brazil. - Yeah. - And he is no longer with us. - Yes. So she has brought some of his research, illustrations, documentation from the 1996 Varginha UFO incident. An unidentified flying object reportedly crashes, and then you have beings associated with the craft, alive and walking through the town. It sounds so spectacular, it sounds so unbelievable, it's hard to wrap your mind around it. And I didn't believe it when I first heard about it. FOX: This is the design. The girls drew this for her father. - That's her father. - MARCO: Yeah. They were in the fire... fireman station. So this is the fireman that... They believe this fireman was involved in the capture? [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] MAN: Oralina, Eurico. FOX: And they saw a UFO that looked like it was definitely gonna crash? MAN: Liliane and Valquiria. - FOX: Right after they saw the creature? - MARCO: Yes. - FOX: Marco Cherese? - MARCO: Yeah. - FOX: Who captured the creature with his bare hands. - MARCO: Yes. FOX: And later died. This is an original artist's rendition of what the girls saw. FOX: Wow! Wow, look at that. Brazil is one of the most amazing locations on Earth. - I mean, you've got Ubatuba in the '50s. - Yeah. You've got Colares, Operacao Prato. You've got 1986, UFOs over Brazil with Sao Paulo. It was amazing. I met with a radar operator. And then you have this crash in 1996 in Varginha. These are some of the best cases in the world. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: 1957. Witnesses observe an object descending at extreme speed from the skies towards Toninhas Beach. Before hitting the water, it explodes. Fragments collected on the beach are sent to a lab to be analyzed. This headline reads, Scientific analysis confirms extraterrestrial magnesium from the alleged Ubatuba flying saucer. - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] - NARRATOR: Photographer Almiro Barauna and the crew aboard a Brazilian navy vessel - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] - witness a disc-shaped object maneuvering over the ocean. - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] - He grabs his camera and takes these shots. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [WOMAN IN OTHER LANGUAGE] NARRATOR: Previously classified Brazilian Air Force documents contain accounts of several UFOs witnessed by both civilians and military personnel. [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] NARRATOR: Shown here are several unknown craft captured on camera by the Brazilian Air Force. Some officers even claimed to see occupants. [SIGNAL BEEPING] NARRATOR: 1986. - [JET ENGINES REVVING] - Over Sao Paulo, six Brazilian fighter jets chase more than a dozen UFOs. [MAN IN OTHER LANGUAGE OVER RADIO] [JET ENGINE REVVING] [REPORTER SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] NARRATOR: The Ministry of the Air Force confirms this encounter in a press conference. [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CHILD IN OTHER LANGUAGE] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [DOG BARKING] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] - She got to meet Carlos de Sousa? - Yes. - In 1996? - Yeah. - And he was the man who saw the UFO crash. - CYNTHIA: Yes. [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] Going back to 1996 and seeing the witnesses and seeing the location of the creatures, seeing the original illustration... You know, the rendition of what the creature looked like from 1996 and holding it in my hands, it was fascinating! And the photograph of the military man, Marco Cherese, who apparently handled one of the creatures. I mean, it just takes you back in time to 1996. And it was just a really, really fortunate opportunity for us. I'm thrilled, and I can't wait to get to Varginha, to be honest with you. You could just say hypothetically, for a moment, if it did happen, how significant of an event would it be? I bet you that everyone would say, there's nothing more significant than this story. If it were true. I just ask people to suspend judgement, listen to the testimony, and then draw your own conclusions. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, we're just gonna drop me off or something. Get some drinks while they go around the block, or wait. NARRATOR: Upon arrival in Varginha, the filmmakers want to hear from locals regarding the alleged 1996 UFO crash. [MUSIC PLAYING] A large monument in the shape of a flying saucer is a clear indication that the town embraces the story. Armed with handmade signs that read, "If anyone knows what happened in 1996, please talk to us." The team takes to the streets. What does he think about the case? - Does he think it happened or it didn't happen? - [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] What are your feelings on Varginha? [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] The 1996 Varginha UFO incident, what do you think? [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] Things are heating up right now, guys. Like, we're finding some witnesses. - These guys is really important here. - Okay, let's bring it. [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] They see a UFO. The UFO gets closer to them, to the point where it's at the height of that street light. Okay, so then what happens? [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] So a lot of people in this town have a little piece of the puzzle. We were only here for an hour-and-a-half, and I can't believe how many people we got to come forward. What I love about this case is it's recent enough where people either heard accounts or experienced things themselves. So, right now, we are going to meet with the mayor of Varginha. So I'm very curious if an elected official will talk about the details of the case and whether he believes it really happened. These sorts of things. [CLAPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [CONVERSING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] - FOX: Look at this. - MARCO: Oh, that's nice. - FOX: That's great. - MARCO: Yeah. [CONVERSING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] FOX: I'm extremely curious, as an elected official, the mayor of Varginha, does he believe that this case happened as the witnesses are reporting it to have happened? [MUSIC PLAYING] The witnesses in Varginha, for me, are some of the most compelling testimony I've ever heard. - [CHUCKLING] - So I didn't believe that a UFO crashed in Varginha, Brazil, when I first came here. But after 10 years... I wouldn't have imagined getting an interview with... an elected official like the mayor of Varginha. If you would have told me I'd be doing that ten years ago, I wouldn't have believed it. Not only that, but he was, basically, saying that he felt that the Varginha case was true, that it really happened. I think we have to remind ourselves how far we've come in the last decade. [ENGINES REVVING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [LEAVES RUSTLING] Put me on that farm in January of 1996. What happened? [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [TRACTOR RUMBLING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] NARRATOR: 1996. Crash witness Carlos de Sousa describes a similar object in this exclusive interview. NARRATOR: January 13th, 1996. Carlos de Sousa is traveling from Sao Paulo to Minas Gerais early in the morning, planning to meet with friends to fly ultra-light planes. [LEAVES RUSTLING] NARRATOR: Now, 26 years later, the team travels with Carlos de Sousa to find the crash site. [VEHICLE RATTLING] Turn around. Right. Careful of the dust. He's trying to remember. FOX: So where the trees were? [FERNANDA PIRES IN OTHER LANGUAGE] PIRES: He doesn't... remember. But he thinks it's this way. Because it's been 26 years... FOX: Is this looking familiar? There's a house up there. But if it's close to a house, then it's gotta be further down this way. Unless the house is gone. - MAN: I think the house is gone. - FOX: You do? [VEHICLE RATTLING] - PIRES: He's asking you to stop. - FOX: Stop? FOX: Right. Let's go. - What does that mean? - Yeah, like big grass. It was around here. Okay. - He wants to go there. - Okay. - So it was a white house, and it was a small house. - Yeah, it was a small house. - So... - The grass was burned. The grass was burned. Why was the grass burned? - FOX: So, is the house gone? - It was around here. The house is gone? He doesn't know. Everything's different. FOX: I mean, it could be here, or it could be there. FOX: We walk over to there and look. If it's close to the road, it only can be in a couple of places. Does he wanna walk up closer to it. He said the house was close to where the crash was. - MARCO: Yeah. - 200 meters. - MARCO: Yeah, it's like... - 600 feet. MARCO: It's my only... My only house. Family. My only family. FOX: Well, I say we... I say we take a closer look. - I mean... - MARCO: Yeah. FOX: You know? Yeah, we gotta do it, man. We got to find this spot! MARCO: There's a lot of trees. Is there a house down there? MARCO: Yeah, there's a house right down to these trees. [WHISTLES] Yeah. FOX: Well, let's get closer to there then. FOX: Let's drive down the road. Let's drive down to get closer. There's a house. This isn't a field. Yes, yes! PIRES: Here. Here! FOX: Wow! FOX: Wow! [SIGHS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SOBBING] FOX: This is the spot. [SIGHS] Was this object big enough to have, potentially, beings inside? [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: According to Mr. Sousa, this area was covered with debris from the UFO crash. This is his first time at the crash site since 1996. FOX: So he gets out of the car. He sees the piece, right? He picks the piece up. He folds it. He said it was really light, and it was shaped kind of like this. - Yeah. - And then he picked it up and he folded it and then it opens itself up. And it was really light. - Yes. - Like aluminum. At what point did the military come to him? - Right after that happened? - Yes. The military came from this way and arrived? Yeah. Carlos Sousa came from here and the trucks came from that side. Okay. NARRATOR: Within minutes, trucks from the military base, ESA, arrive on the scene. - Wah, wah? Go away? - Yeah. I think some guy... FOX: What does "borra" mean? - PIRES: Go away! Go away! Go away! - FOX: Go away? MARCO: Go away! Go away! And I'm ordering. FOX: I'm ordering you? I'm ordering you to go away? - Yeah. - So then he pulled his gun out? - Yes. - And he said I'm ordering you to go away. Wow! NARRATOR: After giving this interview shortly after the incident, Carlos de Sousa vanishes for 26 years. [birds chirping] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - FOX: Mark it. - [CLAPS] Can we just walk to where exactly this took place? NARRATOR: Seven days after Sousa witnessed the crash, Hubert Ladera leaves this gym when he and several friends see two military trucks driving into town. They follow them through the neighborhood and come upon a military blockade. [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] FOX: One of the people in his group said, this is a free country, and I'm going through. It was him. - FOX: Oh, it was him? - PIRES: Yeah. FOX: So he said, hey, this is a free country. I'll do what I want. And then what happens? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] This is the local TV news station that covered the case back in 1996. He was deeply involved. He was also good friends with Marco Cherese, who's the military police officer who, allegedly, handled the creature and then died. - Thank you. - FOX: Yes, of course. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] - FOX: Absolutely. Describe what happened back in 1996. What you witnessed, what you saw. [IN OTHER LANGUAGE] - [THUNDER RUMBLING] - [RAIN PATTERING] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] So is he saying that the military shut down the press? - Yes. - Successfully. - Yes. - They don't have a free press. - And they say... - They don't have a free press. No. If they If they say, if they would have go, like, investigate further, they probably would have put them in jail. Okay, I'll quickly mention. So we have, uh, we have special authorization from the city of Varginha, and we have a universal key which is provided to us by, I think, Katia's husband. And so we're going to film the use of the special key to gain access to the exact location where the encounter occurred back in January of 1996. Action. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] There we go. - [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] - Did you see how easy that was? [LAUGHS] JAMES FOX: I wanted to film here because this is obviously going to invoke memories of the encounter, and I think that we're going to get a more dramatic, more real, um, on camera testimony from the girls, doing it here as opposed to somewhere else. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [MAN SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE] NARRATOR: Media across Brazil and the world cover the story. [MAN SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [MAN SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE] Tell us, walk us through what happened. What did you see? Where did you see it? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] NARRATOR: 1996, based on the girl's testimony, artist Betty Rodriguez, creates this drawing. FOX: What I find makes their stories so credible is that there were three of them. I want to hear from Valquiria because she was the youngest. What were her thoughts at the time? Was she scared? Did you run? Like, put me there. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] FOX: These eyes compared to my eyes, how much bigger? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] - WOMAN: Three times bigger. - FOX: Three times bigger. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] I want to walk over by the wall, and I want you to tell me where exactly the creature was. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] - FOX: Wow! - [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] FOX: Really close. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] I didn't realize it's closer than I expected, I mean, it's like eight-feet away. They were eight-feet away from this creature. Broad daylight. It was 3:30 in the afternoon. This is the exact location. When she made eye contact with this creature, was there a moment of any kind of communication? Did she feel anything at all? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] FOX: Okay, so this is, uh, Valquiria. This is Katia. - Sim. - And this is Liliane. You see the, the eyes. They didn't draw a nose, they didn't draw a mouth. It was all about the eyes. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] I want to understand, uh, first of all, the moment of contact with the eye, with the eyes, meeting the eyes. I really want to be there. I want to feel it. When they locked eyes with this being, what were they thinking? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] They all ran out of here quickly, so they were scared. Were they scared because they felt threatened, or were they scared because they just simply didn't know what they were looking at? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] So the three girls run to her house, and they say, "We saw this creature that might have been the devil or whatever it was." And they, do they, do they get in the car and drive here? Do they walk here? How did they get here? And what do they see when they got here? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Can she draw the footprint? The shape of the footprint? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] - Yes. Sim, sim. - [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] FOX: That's the exact location where the girls saw the creature right through that wall where we filmed already with the girls. I didn't realize that Marco Chereze, the military officer, who allegedly captured the creature, with his bare hands, did it right over here. NARRATOR: Roughly three hours after the girls witnessed the strange creature, Military police officers Eddie Lopes and Marco Chereze drive down this road on the lookout for something unusual. When suddenly, it runs right across their path. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] It was captured by Marco Chereze with his bare hands easily and taken to the hospital. After he captured the creature, he was smelling the creature in his body and his clothes. Because he had this strange feeling of something greasy, sticky, over his body that came from the creature. He developed this, this infection that wouldn't go away. And for two or three weeks it was getting worse and worse and worse. And it looks like that his immunity system was shut down. This were the words used by one of the doctors who treated him, who said that he never saw in his whole medical career anything like that. And that infection killed him. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] FOX: All the witnesses that claim that Marco Chereze handled a creature, a strange creature, doesn't have to be from another world, it was a strange creature, he gets some unknown infection. You did everything you could to save him, and he died. Do you believe that there's some credibility to that story? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] NARRATOR: When her brother falls ill, she asks about his involvement with the case. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] NARRATOR: On February 10th, Marco Chereze is admitted to regional hospital. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Roger, what's the main purpose that you could to Varginha for a new ecological research? The main purpose for being here, uh, is to look at the physical evidence aspect of this case, uh, which is what I specialize in. It is June, the 7th 2002, and I am here in Varginha, Brazil, with the chief investigator on the Varginha episode, Ubirajara Rodrigues. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] NARRATOR: 2002, renowned UFO researcher, Dr. Roger Leir, travels to Varginha to investigate the case. He documents multiple key witnesses on video. This footage has never been released. She is the wife of a deceased member of the military police. I think we should at least know what her husband's name was. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Does she know if anyone has seen a medical report? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Oh, they took a long time to deliver it, and they asked for money, and they, and there were missing pages. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Once she lose, she searched for explanations, but nobody would give any. Was Marco Chereze the only person infected who died? We don't know. Where, uh, these two creatures the only ones that remain alive after the crash? We don't know. We only have, uh, very detailed information about the existence and the capture of these two. One capture in the morning and one at evening of the same day, January 20, 1996. NARRATOR: According to credible reports, there were two captures on January 20th. Hours before the girls' encounter, the fire brigade captured a being. This capture was thoroughly investigated by leading Brazilian researcher and lawyer Ubirajara Rodrigues. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] MAN: This is the fire department... NARRATOR: Dr. Leir teamed up with Ubirajara. They questioned the fire battalion allegedly involved in the capture of the first creature. This is the creature. And this is a, kind of, equipment that is used to catch it. NARRATOR: The fire department was dispatched to this location after receiving several calls from concerned residents who reported seeing something strange in the area. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [MAN SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] INTERPRETER: The Army truck entered by this gate here. Got in over here. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [MAN SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE] INTERPRETER: Got the creature already dead from inside. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] INTERPRETER: The presence of several elements from the military police, from the Army... - [MAN SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] - ...several doctors, nurses... [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] This convoy left the place and went to Tres Coracoes. DR. ROGER LEIR: Both creatures left at the same time. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] INTERPRETER: And the creature that was alive got to Campinas alive. NARRATOR: The team drives to meet with a family who saw a UFO hovering over the area of the encounter and capture. Okay, let me ask. - Let me ask. - Yeah. How about we film the back of their heads talking to me? Like, I don't know. [BOTH SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] - Hey, Fernanda, we have two options. - Okay. Okay. One, we blur his faces, no problem, and we will do that. Two, we film from the backside and their and their faces aren't seen ever. Like doctors, and they all saw the UFO right over this area. It looked like they were looking for something, like it was doing a grid search. And this is a very respectable family. They don't want their faces on camera. They want to talk and tell what they saw, but they don't want their faces revealed on camera, which happens. Okay, so we're standing in very near the area where the girls saw the creature. It was 1996, January. This entire family saw something they want to share with us, but they don't want to have their faces revealed. So what did they see? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Did I hear... I heard Americana. - He stayed American. - Yes. [STUTTERING] What was that about? Some American officials... - Came here. - ...came here to talk about what they saw. - Yes. - Americans? Were they military? Were they police? Who were they? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Is there any way that there is a conventional explanation to what they saw? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] FOX: I just want to go over that interview and what I find. First of all, they hesitated on whether or not they even wanted to go on camera. They canceled yesterday. Today they were like, "Hmm. We don't want... Oh, sorry... "We don't want our faces on camera." It was like an entire family, and they all saw this object and it was really big. Shaped like a disc, zero noise. You have witnesses like that. They're friends of the doctor, the guy that we rent the house from. That you could just tell they've been sitting on that story for 26 years. How excited he was to finally share it. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] There was unusual activity at the base. There were helicopters from the Navy, which in itself was unusual. He sees a box. Was the box unusual? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] So to this day, has he spoken to any of them that went to Varginha? - No, no. - Nothing. - Yeah. - Wow. NARRATOR: According to the witness, it wasn't only the drivers who were never seen again. Their Captain Edson Ramirez, also left without a word. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] NARRATOR: January, 1996. A radiologist has an unexpected visit by the military while on duty at regional hospital. He agrees to share his story, provided his identity remains concealed. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] So we have a big military presence on the outside of the hospital. We've got two army and two police on the inside of the hospital with a box and something inside of a black zip body bag. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] But what did it smell like? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] When they took whatever it was in that black bag, and they left the hospital, the military and the police with that bag and that thing, did the smell leave? [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Three of the most strange, bizarre points, of this encounter. [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] Probably about ten months ago, Marco managed to reach a vetted, legitimate witness who was involved in the transportation of the, they call them E.T. or the being. Um, this guy was so scared, uh, Marco spent, I think, eight to ten months, slowly developing a relationship with this guy. And about four days ago he agreed to meet with me and Marco, just the two of us. So we drove late into the night, we met him at a bar. When he arrived, he was with another guy. He took us to a different location. We sat outside and we talked for a couple of hours about coming forward, appearing in the documentary. I've never ever had the opportunity to interview a witness that potentially handles an extraterrestrial being. I'm worried about the military getting wind of what's going on because there clearly paying attention to this witness. I'm worried about them getting a phone call, reminding him of his oath of secrecy. I don't want to put someone else's family in harm's way. So you're always, in the back of your mind, in a situation like this, you know that at any moment, the carpet can get pulled out from under you, and it's not a done deal until it's a done deal. Listen. I wonder if we should rent a hotel room and then have him come to us. Because, then we can get all the gear inside the hotel room and then he can just show up and walk in. We can, we can stop at the gas station. NARRATOR: Marco coordinates with the witness, military Ex, to secure a safe meeting location. Yes. I made appointment with him in the some hotel right here. Close to here and then, so I think we have to drove... - We go to the hotel first. - Yeah, we go... - Check in and then he just walks in. - Exactly. - [INAUDIBLE] - Yeah, that's good. I feel that, that anxiety in my stomach, you know? It's just like... We pull this off and it's just like first time. It will be the most compelling testimony ever revealed on the history of this case. - JAMES: Oh, my God. This hill's so steep. - MAN 2: I know. JAMES: Entrada, this is the hotel. I would get a quick shot of it, and I'd shut these cameras off right now. Can you guys do that? Shut everything off. Guys? - MAN: Yeah. - Right. MAN: Right here. Here? Fuck! This room is small. You can't even use these cameras in here. MAN: Oh, my God! Okay. He's trying to find the room with two beds. MAN: It'd be better. - Yeah. - MAN: Yeah. MAN: Mark it. Okay. [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: Okay. He's on. Okay. So we are sitting here with Military X who clearly doesn't want his identity revealed which we're not going to do. And he's going to provide enough detail, not too much, but enough detail on operations that he was involved with with the Varginha case. [SPEAKING SPANISH] When he was in Humanitas, this is where he saw part of the creature. - Yes. - What was the atmosphere like? What were the looks on the faces of the other people in the room? - Yeah. - What was it like? Can he put me in that room? [SPEAKING SPANISH] When you looked and you saw the leg or part of the leg and the foot with the "V"... - Right. - ...what did you think? [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: ESA military base, is roughly 20 miles southeast of Varginha. According to witnesses, the Army operations originated from here. Is there filmed footage, video footage of the creature that he knows about? [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: Military X says that on January 22nd 1996, he drove the creature from Humanitas Hospital in Varginha to ESA Army Base, where it would remain overnight. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Does he have any idea where the creature went? Because, uh, it went to Regionas, then Humanitas, then ESA, then Campinas. And then what happened? [SPEAKS SPANISH] NARRATOR: According to Military X, he transported a creature from Humanitas Hospital in Varginha to ESA military base and Tres Coracoes where it stayed for the night. Early the following morning, the convoy continued their mission, heading south from Fernao Dias freeway, then west on Don Pedro to Espcex army base in the city of Campinas. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: The team meets with Brazilian Air Force traffic control officer, Jose Manuel Fernandez, his unit was responsible for monitoring specific airspace over the state of Sao Paulo. Do you know anything about this case? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Was it Americans involved, or was it just the Brazilians involved? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Only Americans. Only. [SPEAKING SPANISH] And how does he know that the Americans were involved? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [RAIN PATTERING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Has anybody seen Eric Lopes? Has anyone ever tried to talk to him? Yeah. People try to reach him out. - People have tried? - Yeah. And nada? NARRATOR: With the help of Varginha mayor, Verdi, the team connects with Mr. da Costa, a military police corporal in 1996. His son, Romulo A Ribeiro, agrees to escort them to the home of Eric Lopes. [SPEAKING SPANISH] JAMES: Can you go up there? NARRATOR: Eric Lopes is the military police officer from P2 who reportedly drove the car during the second capture with Marco Cherese. Not even the family of the deceased officer has been able to get a statement from Lopes. If the reports are true, he is the only living witness of the second capture. Officer Lopes has been unreachable for 26 years. JAMES: Oh, my God. I'll go with him. I'm going with him. [CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] MAN: Hey! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Tell him that the mayor has blessed us. You tell him the mayor said... [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE] This is Eric Lopes? Let me just... Hold on, please. Let me ask you a question. Please. [SPEAKING SPANISH] - WOMAN: He is his friend not... - JAMES: Oh, okay. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What? [SPEAKS SPANISH] Hold up, hold up. Just ask him one question for me. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Will he ever come forward to make a statement? [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN 1: What's happening? MAN 2: This is the house of Eric Lopes. - MAN 1: Yeah. - But he doesn't like to talk. [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN 1: And the threat is that they might shoot us because we're on the property, trespassing. MAN 1: They're talking right now. [SPEAKING SPANISH] - So, Eric won't talk? - No. What just happened? I'm trying... What happened? Is that Eric Lopes? [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Who is that? - Yeah, Eric Lopes. That's Eric Lopes. [SPEAKING SPANISH] He doesn't want to talk at all. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE] - Okay. - Yeah, let's go. Oh, my God. That was Eric. Just saw him. [EXCLAIMS] Okay, okay. We'll go talk. Did you get him? Dave, did you get him? Please tell me you got him. That was Eric Lopes. Oh, my fucking God. Did you get him in the window? - DAVE: Yeah. - JAMES: Holy shit. DAVE: He was on the window the whole time. JAMES: Oh, my God. You got him? This, here. I'm ready to go at this. MAN: You'll be shot if you don't live here. - He will shoot you? - MAN: Yeah. Fuck! If that guy had nothing to hide, he would have just said so. That guy was driving the car that Marco... was in. Write what we just did. DAVE: I got the interview yesterday. It was pretty good. JAMES: For what? No. Right now was pretty gnarly. [SPEAKING SPANISH] JAMES: Ask him if we can talk about what we just did. [SPEAKING SPANISH] JAMES: Okay, okay. Which way did he go? DAVE: To the left. JAMES: We're stopping here? Okay. God, this is... What exactly did he say? [SPEAKING SPANISH] JAMES: And he believed that Eric Lopes was serious? [SPEAKS SPANISH] WOMAN: Yes, he was. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] JAMES: If his story is true, he is walking around with a level of confirmation that only a handful of people on this planet have. What does that feel like? [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: May 8th, 1996, with mounting pressure from media and witnesses, the military base, ESA, holds a press conference. General Lima, addresses the crowd. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] The accumulation of aspects, the girls who saw something, the other people in the town who saw something, this wasn't an isolated event where you got one witness saying, "Oh, I saw something extraordinary." Not at all. They seem to be relatively naive young girls, and there were fire department people involved, who saw the beings, too. And one nice thing about it is that it takes the onus away from saying things only happen in the United States. Well, there was the United States involvement, and it wouldn't surprise me if they paid to pick up the wreckage and you know all the rest of the stuff. Why not? Makes sense. Cheap way to get information. Let the other guy to the work. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] I believe that the Varginha case is much more important today because it is more recent and some of the events have not unfolded yet. Did she have any connection with eyes? Did she make any... Like she saw eye to eye - with the being? - MAN: Mmm-hmm. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Were there live aliens seen walking around this town? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Mmm-hmm. I have deal with this case in 1996 because I have some friends from there. He told that, "Oh, you don't know what is true. But I know what I saw." Oh, James. JAMES: Oh, yeah. Really. WOMAN: Weight off the shoulders. - JAMES: Mmm-hmm. - WOMAN: Yeah. I just wonder like what they said to these witnesses that 25 years later, they still don't want to talk about it on camera at all. It's, like, unbelievable. It's like you over them... Even compensation that they still won't do it. MAN: I know. It's like money doesn't... Well, they won't do it. That's weird. JAMES: The reason why they haven't made overt contacts is because we're so aggressive. [LAUGHING] Come on. [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Would that smell make a good perfume? [BOTH LAUGHING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
