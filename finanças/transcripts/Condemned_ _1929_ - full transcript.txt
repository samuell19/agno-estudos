Close that hatch! Get away from me! Will you close that hatch! Do you want to drown us out? Let us sink, what do we care? We'll be better off drowning than where we're going! No, no! Don't say that! Don't say that! Right, Michel. Let's drown and feed the fishes! What else are we good for? Hey, Captain! Let her sink! She ought to sink, she's a disgrace! We're a disgrace! You're a disgrace. What does it look like? It's not bad. It's green, there are trees! It's a jungle. Give us a look, can't you? It's a jungle. You get away in the jungle! Yes, and then what? They get away every day. I thought it was an island! Part of it is. Hey, you've had your share. Step down, son. Line form on the right for the first glimpse of Devil's Island! Don't crowd, boys, you'll have plenty of time to look at it when you get there. Step down now! Order! Order! Oh, what is it, Jean? Was there something wrong with your lunch today? Nothing I'm not accustomed to by this time. I serve you as well as I know how. The wife of the warden of this prison shouldn't be serving, she should be waited on, like a queen! Now, it isn't good for you to quarrel in this heat. You know it isn't. Well, it's your fault! You have no sense of your position as my wife. Washing your own dishes! Scrubbing your own floors. It makes me look ridiculous. We should have a convict to do the work here. Oh, don't ask me to take a convict into the house, Jean. Please. Please. I'm afraid of your convicts. I'm afraid of everything here. Why did I marry such a fool? See who that is. Madame. What do you want? From the prison, Madame. To notify the warden that the convicts have been landed. He says the convicts have already... I heard him. My tunic. You're sitting on it, Jean. Oh. My helmet. My umbrella. Attention! Attention! Attention! Stop. Well, here you are, and here for the present, you stay. You have only yourselves to thank. You will be expected to learn the regulations. You will be severely punished if you don't obey them. You have come here filled with ideas of escape. You have heard that prisoners here are loosely guarded. That is because this prison lies between the jungle and the sea. The jungle is filled with fever and the sea, with sharks. There is no escape from Devil's Island. Prepare for inspection. - Any relatives living? - No, sir. Any trade? No, sir. All right, move on. 47229. What orders, sir? Hard labor. Get your shirt at that window. Pierre Hidoux, next. Pierre Hidoux, Pierre Hidoux, Pierre Hidoux. Here's your shirt, 47229. Pierre Hidoux, you've been here before. I remember your face. It isn't so easy to forget. You must like it here. I'm hard to kill. You tried escaping last time. I didn't succeed. No. Move on. 47230. Orders, sir. Hard labor, as usual. Jacques Duval. Jacques Duval, Jacques Duval, Jacques Duval. Who wants Jacques Duval? 47230, here's your shirt. Jacques Duval. You're handsomely decorated. I'm a work of art. What's that? That? Thoughts of Mother. And that? The eye of the law. It must have been watching you. I may be hard to look at, but I'm easy to see. Jacques Duval, a soldier, African cavalry, in for life, a murderer. Why didn't you get the guillotine? Well, we have a guillotine of our own. Cut on the dotted line. Move on. 47231. Anything special, sir? Hard labor, the hardest we've got. Michel Aubian, next. Michel Aubian, Michel Aubian, Michel Aubian. Number 47231. Here's your shirt. Is your name Michel Aubian? That's all. Where do you come from? Any place in Paris. You're an unusual type for a criminal. That's been the secret of my success. What's your profession? I'm a thief. So I see. Arrested for robbing a bank. Ah, no, for trying to rob one. What did you do before you took up bank robberies? Robbed easier places. And before that? Picked pockets. Always a thief? No, only since I learned to walk. Let's see your hands. I don't suppose you've ever been a servant. Certainly not. You'll find prison a poor place to be proud in, my friend. Move on. 47232. What orders, sir? Make a note to speak to me about him in the morning. Yes, sir. Felix Carriere, next. Felix Carriere, Felix Carriere. 47232. Here you are. Is this elegant garment for my private use? Can't you read your number on it? My number? Well, why not? All right, I'll think of you when I wear it. Hey, how was the trip over? Marvelous! Marvelous! What time did you get? Life. Where do you sleep here? What're you asking me for? How's Paris? Lousy. Think of sleeping there? Any objections? No, that boy died of the fever this morning. Lucky devil. Is that your idea of luck? It'll be yours yet. Oh-ho, little sunshine. Well, this don't remind me much of Paris! No, they say a change is always healthy, though. That depends on the change. You wouldn't think it, young fellow, but I was brought up in a nice family, I was. I'm sensitive. I almost wish I hadn't killed that woman. Oh, no. I mean it. I always knew it paid to live respectable. Here, smoke up! Oh, I couldn't, it's your last! Huh? We'll smoke together. Like a pair of love birds, huh? Say, we might stick together, too. Hey, it's nice of me to offer that. A first-class murderer like I am, and you, only a common second story man. In the first place, I'm not a common one, and in the second place, I'm a thief, and therefore a man of intellect, which is more than you are. Then you turn down the partnership? Oh, no, I'm not a snob. I'm as simple a fellow as you could wish to meet. Smoke up. Hmm! ♪ We go on marching to our prison cell ♪ Singing a song of the condemned ♪ Dreary dreams, empty dreams ♪ Scheming shattered, scattered schemes ♪ We go on marching ♪ What a tale we tell ♪ Singing a song of the condemned ♪ The world only laughs when we cry ♪ But we'll show the world how the brave can die ♪ Row by row ♪ On we go ♪ To the devil down below... ♪ Who cares about us? I says to him, I says, "How can a man live or work on the kind of grub we get?" Right? Right? Escape! The sea is the better way. You go up this river and down that one, and there you are. Two men got to Havana in a boat. Ah, but they were caught there! The river is a better way! Yes, but they got there. If we could steal a boat... Everybody pass. Deal 'em again! One, two, three. One, two, three. Get back, you men. Back! Get back! Solitary confinement for them. I'd rather get the guillotine! The question is, "What becomes of a man here?" Ah! That's more like it. Now the mirror, fellow, the mirror. Now, if I only had a decent suit of clothes. I wouldn't be so bad. Say! You know I get paid for this. You get paid? Well, now, with what I wonder. I'm afraid you'll have to charge it. Charge it? To you? Uh-huh. Unless... Say, for a convict, you're putting on a lot of airs. Well, why not? After all I'm on my way to be butler to the Warden's lady. In there. Wait here. I gave you your chance to find yourself a houseboy you wouldn't be afraid of. You didn't take it. Now I've found one for you. Oh, Jean, you haven't. Oh, you couldn't. Not after the way I've begged you. Oh, for pity's sake, Jean, don't do this to me, I can't bear it. Once more I ask you. Why did I marry such a fool? I'm afraid. I'm afraid. You'll get over that. Come in, thief. Well, come in, come in. No good will come of this. You'll be sorry. You'll see. You'll be sorry. I doubt that. The kitchen's in that way. Well, a man in my position, not to have a houseboy ridiculous! There you are. You see? You see? A home. A home, my love, that any man could be proud of. Yes, Jean. Oh, you're spilling your coffee on your shirt. Mmm? Oh, well, so I am. I wonder how I did that. I think it must be dripping from your bread, sir. Perhaps you're right, perhaps you're right. I'm sure I'm right, sir. Allow me, sir. Pass me the sugar, my dear. Huh? Ah, yes. What was I saying? You were saying how pleased you are with your home these days. Ah, yes, so I was. And whom have we to thank for that, eh? Michel? Oh, now you're putting me off again. But you've asked the same question every morning since Michel came into the house. Well, I see no harm in that. I wake up every morning, get out of bed, dress myself, shave, drink my coffee every morning. Why shouldn't I ask the same question every morning? A man in my position is privileged to repeat himself. All men repeat themselves. Particularly to their wives. You found Michel, Jean. You persuaded your stupid Alsatian wife to take him in. I thank you, Jean. Will that do until tomorrow morning? I'm not sure you're as respectful as you should be. However, I prefer to ignore that. Michel. Michel, I say! Michel! Fetch me my helmet and my umbrella. Yes, sir. Ah! You're a good boy, Michel. Quite a remarkable type for a criminal. Oh, quite remarkable, sir. What a judge of character I am. Oh-ho, what a judge, sir! Well, I'm off. Goodbye. Huh? Is that any way for a wife to kiss her husband? I'm sorry, Jean. I didn't mean... There. There. There. That's better. Not such a bad wife either. Stupid, of course. Not up to my level, but dependable. Dependable. Well, I'm off. Well... No one can say that I don't deserve my blessings. That is, no one who knows me. Uh-uh. Oh, yes, yes. I forgot. Well, I'm off. Oh, there's the market bell, Michel. Yes, I heard it, Madame. Go get your basket. I'll finish the table. I've just done, Madame. Here, let me have those things. That's a woman's work, not a man's. Whatever it is, it's my work, Madame. And anyway, I'm not a man, I'm a convict. Your husband made that very clear just now. Oh, Michel, my husband doesn't mean... He just doesn't think. Have you noticed that, too, Madame? Michel! Oh, forgive me. Madame, may I say something? If you're sure, you'd better. It's only this, your kindness makes me forget that I'm a convict. You make me wonder how I could ever have been a thief. In the morning, when we come by, the line of us, from the prison, I meet you coming from early mass with your rosary and book. You make me forget that this place is a prison. You make it seem like... Like any village at home, in France, with all the women coming from early mass and the streets, sweet with the smell of baking. That's what I had to say, Madame. You make me very happy telling me that, Michel. And I'm not afraid of you anymore. I'm glad of that, Madame. I'm not the least bit afraid of you. Madame, you almost make prison a pleasure. We mustn't be late to market, Michel. No, Madame. I'll get the basket. Is that fresh killed? This morning. How much do you want for it? Two francs. All right. Oh, good morning, Madame Vidal. Good morning. Here you are. Oh, Michel, I must stop in here. Oh, look, Michel. Did you ever see anything so sweet? For his size, Madame, he certainly has charm. If only the people here were as nice as the monkeys. That's true of people everywhere, Madame. Why doesn't your husband buy him for you? Oh, if only he would. My husband isn't fond of pets. Come get your fish. Fresh fish! You buy the fish, Michel. Oh, how right you are! Two mackerels. I think he's fine. I'd like a lover like him. For shame! Just wait until Vidal finds out. Madame... Oh, now, don't hurry me, Michel. Oh, I'm not hurrying you, Madame. Anything but. That's right. This is the only thing I do here that I like. I come down here by the sea and dream of home. Don't you sometimes think of your old life back in France? Often, Madame. Yes, I suppose you must. You wouldn't be here if it weren't for your old life, would you? No. There's a great deal in what you say, Madame. Poor Michel. What do you remember about France, Madame? Oh, I just remember my little village in Alsace. I've never been to Alsace. No? No. There wouldn't be much there for a thief to steal. No. Tell me about your village, Madame. Oh, life was very pleasant there, peaceful and safe. There's a little square just like any other, where the young people walk and make love in the evening. The inn is at the bottom of the square, just opposite the church. My father kept the inn before he died. He had 14 children, my father did. He wasn't very sorry to see me married off. And there's a fountain right in the middle of the square. The oxen come and drink at it. A fountain with a statue on a column. Statue of St. John. St. John the Baptist. Sometimes I get very homesick for my little village. Oh, look. Look at them down there, struggling in the water. Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Heave, ho! Poor convicts. Prison! Everywhere you look here, prison! Don't you ever think of getting away from here, across the sea, back home? If you mean escape, no, Madame, I do not. If I were a prisoner, I'd escape. Oh-ho, you'd get caught. I'd try just the same, I'd die trying. Well, that was a nice thing for me to say to you. Why shouldn't you say it? After all, you're just as much a prisoner as I am. I, a prisoner? Why... Well, your husband, he didn't come from your village in Alsace? Oh, no. No. He came there with the soldiers during the war. Oh. And that's when you fell in love with him? When I was a child, I fell in love with that statue of St. John. My husband used to look just like St. John. He's changed considerably. He's got stouter, yes. We must go home now. Hey, I want to buy that animal. Huh? I want to buy that animal. How much? Oh, no. That's too much. Uh-uh. No? Well, I wouldn't want a mirror either if I had a face like yours. Uh-uh. Well, if it's money you want, I suppose I'll have to... Now, Michel, which are you going to be, honest or generous? Generous. Huh? I was just talking to myself. Come on. Where were you, Michel? You should be following me. I stopped to do an errand, Madame. Oh, Michel. You bought him for me? Well, the purchase was made through me, Madame. Oh, you darling little fellow. Oh, he's sweet. Oh, thank you, Michel. Thank you. Well, now that we've started... Started? Yes, haven't we started? Who would have thought we had so much to say. No, Michel. There are some things that had better not be said. If you were a prisoner, you'd escape, you said. There are some prisons one can't escape from. No. You are a convict. She is the Warden's wife. Don't be a fool. Madame. Madame. I was just passing by. So was I. On my way to the market. On my way home. They say... They say... And she is the warden's wife, and he, a convict. They used to come here every day. Yes, but it's weeks since they've been here. No. They stay home all day now. Ah! Doesn't Vidal know? Why, the whole town knows. Oh. Mmm-hmm. And they sit in the garden all day. Let's walk by and see. All right. All right. I'm sure they'll be there. I never did like her. I never could see what Vidal saw in her. They tell me, they sit all day in the garden together. I heard that, too. Oh, say! Have you heard? Why, the whole town is talking about that convict. Let's go by and see. And peek over the garden wall? - Shall we? - Yes. I was hoping that he'd make love to her. He'd make love beautifully. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Poor old... You seem to take great interest in my garden, ladies. Such cabbages... Such marvelous cabbages. Be good enough to tell me what you meant by... By what? Oh... Nothing. Good morning, ladies. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Poor old Vidal. Stop that singing! Why, Jean! You, too! Oh, no, no! Oh, how could you? Oh, no! How could you? I've stood for that monkey long enough! You weren't expecting me? Eh? What is the matter with you, Jean? Are you ill? Ill? No. Yes. Yes, I... I have a headache. Oh, now, you've been walking in the heat again. How many times... Michel. Michel, run down to the prison and tell the doctor to come here. No. No doctors! Oh, Please, Jean. It may be sunstroke. I say no doctors. You will take care of me. Yes, of course. But you'll stay quietly at home? Oh, yes. Yes, I'll stay at home. I'm needed more at home than anywhere. That's right. And you'll sit by me and nurse me. Yes, of course, I will. And show me what a good wife you can be to me, eh? Will you take those things into the kitchen, Michel? Wait! Come here. Closer! How old are you? Who? Me? Yes, you! Twenty-nine. Twenty-nine. Get out! Go back where you belong! Jean! Go along, Michel. Go along... Jean, I never heard you speak like that before. What is the matter with you? What is the matter? I'm not sure yet. One has to be absolutely sure about these things. Come, lie down. Lie down, now. You'll see what good care we can take of you. Oh, yes. Yeah. I'll see a great deal, won't I? Where are you going? To the kitchen. What for? Why, to get some vinegar and water to bathe your head. Lie down now. Lie down and rest, and close your eyes. Oh, yeah.

Is it? I must have been dreaming. Dreaming? The bed is the place for dreaming. Are you ready for bed? Yes. It's after 9:00. What's the matter now? I don't know. You're crying. I can't help it if I am. Help it? Certainly you can help it! I can't... I can't... I thought you were... Well... Never mind. Here, drink this. I'll get a glass of water. You've spoiled the softest berth a convict ever had, that's what you've done. You wasn't sent here to give no monkeys to ladies. Ah, women! You and I'd both be angels if it weren't for women. At least I would. Well, I would be a law-abiding respectable citizen if it weren't for women. With a large family, too. Yes, you'd need women for the family. Oh, let's go to bed. Careful, Michel. Careful. You're acting so strangely tonight, Jean. You've noticed that? I can't help noticing it. I'm thinking we might do without Michel. I thought you liked Michel. Have you any objections to letting him go? Haven't you better tell me just what's on your mind, Jean? Better lock up. You've fallen in love, that's what you've done, Michel. You've come to prison and you've fallen in love. Can't nothing learn you to live respectable? I'm not in love. She's kind to me and I'm grateful. That's all it comes to. It's only when I... When I think of them together... What then? That's harder to take. Careful, Michel. Careful. Careful. You almost dropped the lamp. I'm sorry. You don't want to set the place on fire, do you? No. What are you staring at? You. Me? What's got into you? You act as though you'd never laid eyes on me before. We weren't married yesterday, you know. Eh? No, we've been married quite some time. Happily married. I've been a good husband to you. A good husband. Come here. No. What? I can't. Oh, don't touch me. I'm afraid of you, I don't want you to touch me. Oh, Jean. So, you're afraid of me, eh? Are you afraid I found out your secret? I don't know what you're talking about. It isn't such a secret as you think! The whole town knows it. What are you talking about? It's the town that's talking! Calling me poor old Vidal! Poor old Vidal! But that may be what you call me, too. Please, Jean. You're not afraid of him, are you? I won't listen to you, I'll run away from here. I'll run to the priest, I'll... You'll listen to me and to the rest of this town jabbering. Jabbering how you and your convict, your young... I won't listen to you. It makes no difference if he is young. 29, 59, 89! He's a convict. I won't listen. I'll get to the truth of this. If I can't get it from you, I know who I can get it from. Not Michel. Why not Michel? Have you gone crazy? No, don't go. You can't. No, no, stop. Michel hasn't done anything. Stop! Oh, stop! Can't somebody stop him? He'll kill him. Oh, don't let him kill Michel. Don't let him kill Michel! Michel. Michel. Michel. Oh, Michel. Well, well, well, well... Here he is now, sir. Now! It's about time, too! So, come here. Leave me alone with this man. No, wait, wait. You had better not leave me alone. Wait there by the door. Can you guess why you have been brought here? Come on. Now, you tell me and save us the trouble of guessing. I'll put you where you won't feel so bright, my friend or so young either. You'll put me nowhere. You've got nothing on me. There's nothing to get on me. You've been annoying my wife with your attentions. She hasn't said so. Tell me the truth if you know what's good for you. Oh, let's go back and get our beauty sleep. Did you or did you not give my wife a monkey? Supposing I did? What of it? Are you or are you not my wife's... Oh, oh, oh, oh. I wouldn't ask that if I were you. Why not? Because your mother wouldn't be proud of her little boy. Thinking such nasty thoughts about a lady. Answer me! Are you or are you not? It's a sweet state of affairs when a man in your position can ask such a question of a man in mine. But I'll answer you if you are dead certain you want the answer. And what is the answer? What is it? Hold him. We got him, sir. He struck me. Yes, he struck me! You saw him strike me. Yes, sir. Take him away, take him away. Lock him up. Wait, wait. You said I had nothing on you, eh? Well, I've got something on you now. You're going to the solitary cells, my friend! You're going to solitary and you are going to stay there! You'll see how young and bright you feel! Oh, all right, it's worth being locked up for. Take him away. Take him away. Michel! We're both prisoners, remember that, Madame. Take him away! Take him away! What have you done? What have I done? Your lover tried to murder me. He isn't my lover, he never was, and never would have been my lover. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying, it's the truth I'm telling you. I was the one. I was the one who loved him. That's the truth and I don't care who knows it. I love him and I'll always love him, and I'd die for him. Better take things easier than that, son. Men go crazy here if they don't take things easy. He's crazy already. Trouble? It's that boy in Number Three again. He won't last much longer now. Oh, well. Well, I guess that's that. Psst! Psst! Oh, it's you again. Not so loud. What do you want? Who are you? I'm Pierre Hidoux, doing six months of the quiet life for killing a man in a fight the day we landed. I came on the boat with you. Don't you remember? Yes, I remember. Stand on your bed, we can talk after the sentry passes. It makes things easier to talk a bit. No, I have nothing to say. You used to have plenty to say. Before I came here that was. How long are you here for? Six months. Six months! I lost my head over a woman. First time in my life. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't realize I was doing it! Eh, not so loud. I fell in love, that's what I did! Went and lost my head. Now, look at me! Oh! Can't somebody stop that brat! Hang that guy! Stop that noise! Ah, don't bother. Let them beat their brains out. All right. I haven't got it after all. He won't give us any more trouble, not for six months, anyway. Why don't you lock me up in a cell, too? I suppose you don't think you deserve any punishment. You have no moral sense. You make a laughing stock of me and then you stand there like Joan of Arc. I've a good mind to send you back to France. Oh. You don't seem to relish that idea. No. Why not? You know why not. You are shameless, positively shameless. I'm honest, anyway. I don't care what you do to me, only don't send me back. Back you go by the next boat. You can find other things to love in France. How will I know what becomes of him if you send me away? If you had any sense of decency, you wouldn't want to know. Oh, Holy Mother! Well, I consider it a sacrilege for a woman like you to mention the... However, if you have a mind to pray, I have no objection to that. Here, here, pray for forgiveness. No, I'm not going to pray. Go on and send me back. Kill me, if you like. You'll see who gets the best of this. I'm not afraid of you now. I despise you. I loathe the sight of you! Send me back. I'll find a way to get the best of you! You'll see if I don't! Well, in the meantime... Come in, murderer. So that you won't be lonely, I've found you another houseboy to replace your... To replace Michel. The prison hadn't anything prettier or safer to offer. There. I hope you like him. Well, give me that broom, Madame. It's all right, Madame. I'm Michel's friend. His friend? Just that, Madame. I see. This the day you boys go over solitary way? Yeah. I should send a small package back over here. Huh? What would be the nature of the package? Cigarettes. No knives or files or anything? Feel of it. Cigarettes for the new one. The new one? No knives or files or anything? Feel of it. Cigarettes for the new one. The new one? No knives or files or anything? Feel of it. Cigarettes for the new one. The new one? No knives or files or anything? Feel of it. We'll just walk along. I don't care so much for your view at that. Too flat for my taste. Oceans is apt to be flat. Pierre! Pierre Hidoux! Pierre Hidoux. Yes, I'm here. I want to be sociable now. Here, smoke this. Wait, I'll give you a whole package. And the matches with them. Now... Now, tell me all you know about escape. You tried it once. You told me how you tried it. Go on, begin talking about escape. Escape from here? Don't be a fool. It can't be done. I'm going to do it. I'm gonna make history, brother. I've just got my ticket back to Paris, and I can't miss that boat. I've got a scheme, brother. I've got a scheme. I've been thinking, give it up. Not a chance. You do your part. I'll do my part. But the... Every man for himself! Man missing! - Man missing! - One man missing! Can you see anyone in the water? No one in the water! How about that gate? The gate's unlocked. Unlocked? Where are you going? I'm going to look outside, sir. Well, you go with them, too! Hey, go with them outside there! Look outside that gate everywhere! Which man got away? The new one. Well, he won't get far. There you are. That's a boy. Got away in a motor boat, too. Eh? Well, why don't they have an ocean liner there to take him back to Europe. Fools, the jackasses! I'll have a lot of them broken for this. What orders, sir? Orders! Orders? A man breaks out of solitary and you ask me for orders! Give him the Legion of Honor! Give him anything, but don't ask me! What did you say his name was? Aubian's the name, sir. What's that? - Michel Aubian. - You know him, sir. I didn't think you were serious about letting him go. Who said anything about letting him go? Well, then the usual thing I suppose, sir? No, no. Not for Michel. No, I shall have special orders for Michel. Only let me think a moment. Let me think. You... You're going after him yourself? Don't you think I'd better? I told you that young man wouldn't give us any more trouble. I wasn't quite right. Well, this will be the end of it. Hey, you there, Jacques! What about that food? One minute, Warden, one minute. Oh, well, bring it down after me to the wharf. Here, you stay here and cover them. Yes, sir. Come on, you! Wake up, wake up! I'll help in the kitchen. You... Would you mind waiting in front, outside I mean? Certainly not, Madame. Thank you. Madame... You've got to find him and take things to him. Careful, Madame. Soldier! Or he'll starve out there if you don't get food to him. Get hold of yourself, Madame. You've got to find him, Jacques. You've got to find him. Well, he won't have time to look. Michel, Michel! Don't kiss her. Why not? You'll throw your luck. Well, he's right. You'd better run. You've got to learn to live respectable. Oh, Michel, you shouldn't have come. You're wrong. I've got important business here. Oh, but there are soldiers all around the house. Well, keep them out of the kitchen. Are you nearly ready, Madame? Oh, yes. In just a minute. You startled me. Forgive me, Madame. No, no, don't pull the curtain. He'll suspect. Here. Take this out to him and keep him talking a minute. What is it? A piece of cheese. A piece of cheese. Now, pay close attention. Here we are, and here up the Coast is Paramaribo. Your boat's up there. Now I come up our river and cross the jungle and down this other river to meet you at Paramaribo, where you are waiting on the boat for me. Do you understand? Do you understand? Now, I don't know how I get there or when I get there, but with you behind me, I do get there somehow, and in time. And you get me on board and we sail together. Back to France. Oh, anywhere will do. Well, you must have clothes for me. A goodly disguise, everything. Money, ticket. Can you manage? I'll manage somehow. Oh, my love. What's the soldier doing? Eating the cheese. All right, I'll be off. You go ahead and scout. And wait. Take that food. I can make use of it. Keep the soldier talking. Five minutes now will mean a lifetime later. Has that dolt come from my house yet? Not yet, Warden. Ah! Can I get no obedience here? Stop fooling with that light. Start her up! They can't hear me with that racket going. Goodbye, Jacques. Goodbye, Michel. Hey, wait! What? I'm going with you to look after you. What? Sure, just decided. I'm in for life. I got nothing to lose. Shut that motor! Listen! What did you cut your motor for? They can hear it. They've cut their motor, too. Yes, but not soon enough. After them! Hit you? No! Make for the shore. What's that in that boat? Their food, sir. Food? Well, they won't get far without that. Land! Land! And get after them! Not that way, over this way! I'm here, sir! Which way, sir? That way, you fool. Go on, scatter! Scatter! Michel. Coming. Let's follow this, it might break the trail. Warden, Warden! Michel... I'm all right. I can take the lead. I hear them. Quiet. Let's follow. Come on! Which way now, sir? You go that way. Well, down. He came this way, all right. No, the other way. He might have gone anywhere. Well, well, well? They passed here, sir. You can see their footsteps. - What's that? - Where? There. A rosary, sir. A rosary. I see. I should have thought of that before. I think we can call off this search. I think I know where to look for our friend Michel. And so, my love, we part. Goodbye, Jean. You say that almost sadly. Will you come aboard? I think our parting is finished. Oh, Captain. Oh, how are you, Warden? Uh... Captain, I have been studying the map. If one went up this river, crossed the jungle and down that other river to the north, one might reach Paramaribo that way too, eh? Yes. I wonder, Captain, would it be possible for you to... Yes. That could be done. How long do you lie over in Paramaribo? You wait here. I'll come back for you. Oh, hold me. Hold me. Oh, I want to hold you. Only... Yes, I know. I must behave. I mustn't waste time. Oh, but look, Michel, I've got everything. See. Even an extra shirt and an extra pair of socks. Oh, my goodness. Wonderful... Is there... Can that be a razor? And soap and a brush. Oh, my darling. My wonderful beauty. Everything. Are you ready? Just a minute. Just a minute. Now! Here's the coat. Quickly, Michel. Oh, what if it doesn't fit. I'm no tailor, you know. Why, it's a triumph. I shall wear it in Paris. Tell me once more. I love you. I love you. Today, tomorrow and always? Always, always. Here's your luggage. You have to have some, you know, or they suspect. Oh, well, I can put the extra pair of socks in. Yes. Here's your ticket. Now I'll go for Jacques. Oh, give me the hat and coat. And walk around just like any other passenger. Only don't let them see that you are nervous. No, and tomorrow... When we're at sea. We'll be at sea. ...I'll scrape an acquaintance with you on deck. That's right. Oh, my love, my only love. What you have done for me. Next stop, Paris, darling. Yes. Huh? Oh! Good evening, my love. You... You followed me. No, I came with you. Where have you got him? Him? I don't know who you mean. Don't you? No, there's... There's no one here. That was wise of you. Oh, I won't let you go. I won't let you go. You can't have him, he's mine. You've done enough. You leave him alone. You've done enough! Go get him! Oh, I know you! You'll take him back and you'll never let him go. You'll persecute him until he's dead. He'll never have a chance with you. Oh, it's true, Michel, he'll never be satisfied until he kills you. You may be right. What's going on? Tell the authorities we've got our man. Get extradition papers from the Dutch Court and tell them not to take all night about it. I'm ready to go! Come on, let's get it over with! Take him ashore! Take him ashore! Quick, someone, lower a boat! You can't get a boat down there! Somebody do something. Got him. It's all right, Michel. Just remember, live respectable. Live respect... Jacques. We've got to go ashore now, you've got to go back. The law must take its course. I know. Will you let me say goodbye? We've got to serve our time through to the finish till we both square with life. It won't be long. We'll still be young. And you'll wait for me? I'll wait for you, Michel. I'll wait for you. You wait. You wait. I'll live respectable. Oh, let's go!
