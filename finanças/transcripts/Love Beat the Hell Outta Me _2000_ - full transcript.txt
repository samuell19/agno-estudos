- (soft violins) (R&B music) - (mumbles) - Yeah, it is, like everytime, I mean everything I do, she just - I understand, I understand Glenn, I do. You know, it's just funny that, how life is sometimes. You know, sometimes relationships just don't work out the way we want them to work out. You know, but, you know, I just hate to see you like this. I mean, come on, Glenn. You've got to be strong and you've got to get out of this. You've got to snap out of it. I don't want you being depressed like this. There are too many women out there. There are too many and you are a good man and believe me, you can get a woman, any woman you want. You're a successful doctor. You have so much going on. and if she can't see that, fuck her. (hip-hop music) - [Glenn] A lot of people don't understand how a friendly game of dominoes can lead into some serious shit. Now, I was getting over a breakup with my girl, getting together with a few friends. At least I thought they were my friends. Who would know that a good time would turn into this. Normally, there are three sides to every story, my side, her side, and the truth. In this case, there were five, four guys, plus the truth. (laughing) - [Man] Fuck you man. - All this time, we waiting on you. - Brother, you ain't gotta wait for nobody. Yeah, you wait 'cuz you want to. You start when you want to. Nobody asked you to wait. - We ain't drinking beer. - Hell, man I come when I'm ready, same as usual. - [Glenn] Wesley, like the dearest of people everywhere was one who we least appreciated. If there's anybody you ever wanted to have your back, it's Wesley. But sometimes, he's got your back so hard, you feel like you're carrying a brother. And now, this new thing he's going through with women, man, I don't know. You tell me. - That's why you give me a while girl anytime. - What? - Yep, that's what I said. - You know why? Because they don't care nothing what you have to say. Now, I'm talking to this white girl the other day and I told her, you know what I said? I said, "See you later, because I'm going to get me some "fellatio on the patio and what time I be back, "you better not ask." (laughing) (laughing) - Lying motherfucker. - He can't even, he can't even spell fellatio. (laughing) - [Voiceover] Me and this brother had this girl one time. Naw, that's another story. You see, his whole trip is respect. He don't give it and he ain't got it. Now, at one time or another, something must have cost him 'cuz now he's out to make everybody pay. - I'm telling you, man, tramps, every one of 'em, man. Women ain't shit, from, from Carla to Wanda to Sheila, all the same man. - [Samuel] Shit, you can name all day. - [Chris] Every one of 'em's some tramps. - Chris, man. - Nah, no exceptions, man. - Man, wait, now hold on. - Bullshit, you pussy-whipped motherfucker. Every one of them hoes is some tramps. Now, you look around the table and you tell us which one of us haven't been turned out by some low-life, open-your-leg-tramp hoe to anybody that come around. Name one of use who haven't. - [Voiceover] Samuel, I met through Chris. Now, they were friends before us. I liked his loyalty, which regardless of sides went always with his friend, he's on everybody's side. Anybody else got a problem? He's the man with the plan, (chuckles) as if he can keep his own shit straight. I mean, he can pretend with everybody else, but we know what's really going on, right? Ol' Captain Save-A-Hoe. - Look, I'm all over town, baby. You just better keep up. Everyday is something, something everyday. Shit, what's today? Look, I ain't got to tell y'all. Y'all know how it was. Before, I couldn't have told you the day of the week, trembling just to watch TV, scared of a love scene, nevermind pop radio. Love songs was torture, but you know what? To hell with Gina or the motherfucker that she left with. You know, I was thinking of stalking Kenny G. - [Chris] (chuckles) Why? (laughing) - Now, it's a different girl every day. Shit, my dick don't get hard without my appointment book. - This is what all y'all need to be doing. A bunch of drunk-ass alcoholics. - Like you don't drink? - No, but I ain't trying to keep nothing from y'all. If I had brought enough, man, all y'all would be welcome to some'n. But, I didn't. (laughing) - [Glenn] You gave me your word. - [Samuel] And you believed him. - Shit, that was a long time ago. - [Glenn] A long time ago-- - I know when I broke up with Karen, this what I told her. I told her that I wasn't gonna smoke with nobody else, you know, because that was supposed to be special between us. - [Samuel] No. (laughing) Well, I'm over at her crib the other day 'cuz I'm still tapping that ass (laughs) and she offered me a little bit of the herb she had to take with me and I told her, you know, "No, I don't need it." I said, "I can't smoke with nobody except you." Telling lies so motherfucking good, you would swear it was the truth, you know. - You turned down smoke? - It's true, though, man. I wasn't trying to lie. - [Glenn] A liar ain't gotta try to lie. - Meant every word at the time. (laughing) - I am astonished at your recovery, man. I mean after all of the shit she put you through. Man, look at you, man. - On top of that, another man? - Then, he had to move in with his mama. (laughing) - [Samuel] Damn, man. Damn, the treachery, man. - Your delayed punctuality precludes you from the knowledge that this issue is closed. (R&B music) - Wait until you see what I got for him. - What you got for who? - This time, the fire. - If it's over, you need to leave him alone. - I have left him alone, with a vengeance. - For what? - For everything. For not loving me. For all those years. - I am, however, grateful. (laughing) for the considerate acknowledgement of my extraordinary recovery. - Will somebody get me a tourniquet before I bleed, shit. (hip-hop music playing) Alright, damn, nigga, it was just a joke. Alright, I'm sorry. - You ain't sorry. - Fuck you, then. (chuckles) - Hey, hey, hey, y'all leave the young blood alone, man. He's just like that because you gang up on him. Look, now can we start this game sometime before I got to go? - Where you gotta go? - Hold up. - Hey, shit, I'll find somewhere. Hell, anywhere. It ain't for you to know. - Alright, now. (dominoes rattling) - Alright, now we're getting somewhere. (R&B music playing) (laughing) - You better beware. - Beware of what? - [Chris] Go ahead and pass, you know you wanna pass. - What are you hiding and looking to turn away from? - What am I? What are you? - Hey, fellas. Come on. - Play the game if you're gonna play. - Months, I've been swearing that I hated him. Guess what I finally got around to telling him. (scoffs) I said I loved him. - (inhales and sighs) And do you? - [Samuel] You want something to worry about? You worry about you. Hell, if I could, I'd take all of this loving I'm getting so you satisfied too. See, so don't reproach me for mine. (laughing) - As long as you're happy, so am I. - Maybe next time after a down stroke, I'll call you up. Say, "Glenn, how was it for you?" - You're doing the right thing, Samuel. Stand all of them hoes in a row. - [Samuel] That's right. That is right. - Tell them, the first one to step out of place, straight to the back of the line they go. - Now, what you got to say about it, huh? At least I've got something I can say. What you got to say about it? - [Glenn} I think (mumbles) - [Samuel] 15. - [Chris] You don't need to smoke no weed. - What I got to say about what? - Oh, come on, pretend like you don't know, as if you're not aware that something is wrong. - That day when he told me he loved me, it was in a way I've never heard. There was a tear on every word. (sighing) His eyes had so much hope inside. Black horses driving a coach for a bride and groom, on the way to a long awaited honeymoon. I knew those eyes. - Look, I have no intentions of saying anything, but if you insist on hearing what it is you think I think, if you knew what I was thinking, then I wouldn't have to open my mouth to tell you to shut up. - So, how is your daughter? - That's right, Samuel. Make sure you get yours. (laughing) - Now, you don't think she's doing the same thing? - Look, look, listen, man, If they get back together, fine. You know, he didn't ask for none of this shit. He might as well make the best of the situation. - [Wesley] So, how is your little girl? - She's doing fine, man. Thanks. She lifts my spirits. You know what she said to me? She said, "Daddy, I told you to marry Mommy." - Well, you did ask her, right? - She said I was too late. - Wait a minute, you waited 14 years. How long you expect a bitch to wait? - Are we gonna talk about this? Because what did I say? - Well, when you love somebody what's the difference? - What's the difference? To a woman, a lot. Hell, a lot to a woman. - Look, I didn't understand. I mean, the way I felt, we had a perfect life. - Yeah, you might have thought so, but what did she? - She never complained. I mean, I didn't know how important it was. - [Wesley] Y'all can count them. - Yeah, well, what did she have to say? - (chuckles) Say? She tossed him far out the door, is what she said. - She does love me as much as ever. I know it. - Shit, that's straight up bullshit. - Motherfucker, damn. - I just don't want this boy to get hurt. - I'm going to be fine, man. I'm embraced by a wonder of my love for her and the understanding of its importance in my life. - Yeah, well, she loves you, you think? - Hey, with all of her heart and soul. That's what I do. - Alright, well, she's gonna be back. - [Samuel] Please. - [Wesley] Trust me. (laughing) - Listen to you, man. Fools, all of y'all. - [Wesley] Your mama's a female impersonator. - She ain't going nowhere. You the only one when she kicked your ass out good. - [Glenn] Samuel, ease up. - It's the same as any woman, man. I mean, she got game on you. She's playing you for a sucker 'cuz she's got all the power now. Standing on your fucking neck with all of her weight pressed down. - And if she back up for a minute it's just to gather speed. (laughing) - Even when you not around, she is playing you, and it's getting worse, man. So, you remember I said that. - She knows all your buttons and the combination to kick your ass besides. - [Glenn] Y'all need to quit. - You got you a beat down coming, baby. - A beat down, that's exactly what you got. - Thinking you're getting ready for a reunion. Nigga, you better get ready to cry. - Worse thing you could imagine, don't be surprised. - She took from me my family. Doesn't matter whatever happens else. - You can believe that lie if you want to. That still don't make that shit true. Because, see, what you're dealing with here, is a rebel bitch on the attack (laughing). - She ain't gonna be through with this motherfucker until he bleeding out his eyes and the last drop dries. - Punishing him gradually and by degrees. - Anybody needs to get realistic it's you, not me. I'm not the one running around chasing a thousands girls, every single one, all that look like the last kind claiming some kind of victory in disguise. - Yeah, well, better than you. - It's all a power trip, man. It ain't if it's nothing else. - [Samuel] Ain't if it's nothing else? - I mean, you ask anybody that got some sense and they will tell you. Otherwise, everybody in the world would know. Man, she is playing with your mind. Not enough that you can see it, just enough to blind you. It's nothing in these words that she's coming at you with, it's in the intentions that's behind it. She's got a vice and she's just fastening it, tighter. Calculated tenderness, just for the effect of it. Got a minefield of revelations for him time-released so that the agony is more spread. You going to die for a long time before you really do. - [Voiceover] Listen to this, I'm trying to concentrate on this game. With relentless fools like these, you learn to chill your feelings quick. Not a day goes by I don't think about that wedding and all of the pain it caused. (R&B music) - [Man] Everybody, everybody. Your attention, please. It's time for the old custom, the throwing of the garter belt. - Come on Chris, get our motherfucking ass up, man. You ain't got to catch the damned thing. Just get in line. - Honey, it don't look like they want to catch it. - Look, can we go? What we waiting for? - Now, where's Glenn? - He's probably getting his hair weaved. - [Glenn] Look, if I was eligible I'd be standing over here. Say something else about my hair. - [Samuel] You better grab that shit. Unlucky motherfucker like yourself. - Ask your mama if I'm unlucky motherfucker. - Why you gotta go there? - [Wesley] Why not? They need to hurry up, 'cuz my drink is getting limp. - Anything you got is limp, limp-dick motherfucker. - I give to you, my friends, a treasure. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - [Groom] Believe it or not, a prize. (glass chime together) - Fuck you. - Fuck both of y'all. - May God bless some lucky man. - Ain't y'all gonna get it? - Fuck you. - [Wesley] It get's very, very intimidating. I'm gonna get me some. (R&B music) - Tell us, when was the last time you had a woman? Just any time, tell us when was the last time when. Otherwise, you need to shut the fuck up until then, nigga. (laughing) - Listen, let me tell you what you do. - [Chris] No, no, no, I'll tell you. - Nigga, you can't tell me shit in the shape you in. - Please, listen to me. Between a man and a woman, everything is controlled. There is but one master who possesses the object of the other's desire hold. One authority commands the keys to the kingdom around which is gate, where and the other outside is required to wait. Make no false move, lest you give yourself away, betraying your feelings puts the other on you. Kisses connive, embraces deceive. Watch your back, says your lover, if you was me, lest you lose the floodgates to expanding your heart filling your soul with ecstasy to sanctify every part. Your love, something that begins all acquired and ends deafening you. Her eyes, the pools of coolness that you swim through. Her voice, the music of angels that strum at your heart. Tender and moist and serene to the touch, her body, God with the power to bless. - With all that, you ain't said shit. - [Glenn] Shit, that's knowledge. - You must have to be dumb. - Nigga, I ain't gotta be dumb to whoop your bitch ass. - No-pussy-getting motherfucker, always fucking with somebody. - All I asked Glenn, nigga, is what are gonna do? - I don't have to do anything. - That's perfect right there. - He turned off all the engines and the pilot has to come to him. - Don't be a fool, dude. She got your number, man. It ain't no protection from that. - Man, she's just a woman like anyone else. - No, you just a woman. (laughing) - Listen to this punk. She's guilty man, I'm telling you. - Give me a motherfucking break, motherfucker. Please, I mean, this girl could eat glass. She don't give a damn about you. To do what she did, or else how could she? I'm telling, this is how sisters are. This is what they do. She is trampling all the fuck over you. - Sisters will do that. - [Wesley] That's exactly what they do. They cut off your Johnson, then they serve it to you, after they microwave it. - Sisters, I know. (laughing) - Sisters don't play. (R&B music) - We are the same, I just want you to know that everything is going to work out, okay? - You really think so? - Baby, I know so. - (scoffs) Alright, if you say so. - (mumbles) okay. - Can you get me something to drink, baby? - Sure. - Thanks. - [Man] Hey baby, excuse me. Is this seat taken? Why don't you join me in the Jacuzzi? Come on. - [Voiceover] Now, he's straight fronting. His mind ain't on dominoes. Since that woman left his ass, man, he's been all jacked up. All that shit he talking, nothing but a front. Underneath it all, he all bruised up. He talks like he's beyond it, but let's see who brings it up. I'm not. - I didn't have a muscle to stand. I was broadsided, you understand. One minute I'm in my cozy little room, then came a tornado. Tossed me through hellfire, a thousand miles elsewhere landed me somewhere, somewhere I know not. - [Woman] This feels so good. She fixed her mouth to say it's over. How she managed to put those words together is beyond me today. She was unhappy. I had no idea. Gravity compelled me to my knees. I begged without interruption, please. How could she do this to me? Myself, our daughter, the family. It could not be done. Oh it was out of her control. She may as well have said that day, "God broke with me." If I was unworthy of forgiveness, then so was he. An internal flame consumed me from outside within and with such hatred, so wrongly baptized. It was a miracle I didn't die. Everybody had died, it was just the same as. To say it as unbearable is to only hint at the truth. Clouds rose up and blackened the sky. The sun smoldered, taking my vision, that nothing existed between it in my eye. Neither my step or the ground together were aware. I was conscious only of pain, pain encompassing all everywhere. All this and more I could forgive, but that she put another man between her legs, legs that brought my child into this world. That is the reason that she must die. So, tonight as the cock crows, so she will lie. It will be brutal - [Chris] Talking all that and so hurt. - [Chris] shit (mumbling). - Check this out, check this out. (hip-hop music drowns out speech) - You gonna play or not? What are you throwing out? - Connect the dots, man. - Come on, man. - Then she told me one day, I'd be grateful for what happened. Said "You gonna thank me one day." - Shit man, I'd kill a bitch do some shit like that to me. Excuse my language. - You would not. - Shit, nigga, I'm a cold-blooded motherfucker. You may think I'm not. You can kid yourself all you like, baby, but believe me I ain't playing. - Alright all y'all. - You ain't got to believe me. Do something and find out. - Whatever you say, OJ. - OJ is right. You'll be waiting to get out of jail. - Y'all let them women treat y'all like a bunch of bitches, but to me they will not. - That's right. - So, Chris, do you love me? - [Chris] Oh, get out. - (laughing) What? (laughing) What, what do you mean "get out"? We're in the middle of nowhere. Are you kidding? You're serious. You're serious, you're not kidding? Quit playing, Chris. You're serious? We're in the middle of nowhere. How am I? Where am I going to go? - [Operator] Thank you, ma'am. Your taxi will be available in 45 minutes. - With all due respect, Chris, kiss my ass. - Damn, nigga, I'm waiting for a couple hoes right now. What the fuck are you doing? I'm feeling sorry for you, you pitiful man. - If you ever looked in the mirror, you'd see that you ain't got enough pity to spare. - [Wesley] You know what's a trip? How after your girl gives you the rule, and how beautiful she gets? - Ain't that the truth. - You could be unfortunate in the face, blind in one eye, but you be wringing your hands to keep from the crowd. - Yeah, that's the truth, too. - Baby can sound so innocent and sweet with a venom that no poison can beat. - Now, which thing she did was this? - Eventually, she say some other woman is going to be lucky to have me one day. - Oh, that's a body slam there. - When you find somebody, she gonna be mad then. - [Glenn] Man, I was trying so hard to be cool. I told her no more, not to do that, and now to this day, swear to God, she haven't stopped yet. - I'd be adding them up. That's another ass-whooping coming you got. (laughing) - You think I'm lying. It's torture and it's intentional. - [Wesley] Mmm-hmm, 'cuz a scorned woman's fury is hell. - Worse thing is, I didn't deserve it. - Oh, please, nigga that's a God-damned lie right there. You would've dogged that bitch out anytime you could have. First time somebody gave you an opportunity. - Don't try to run my business. Sure, I was tempted but I never did. That's the difference right there. - The difference right there is you a hypocrite. That's what you are. Anything wrong with somebody else, you the first one to point it out. - No, nobody can loan even a dollar to you. You loan him a dollar, don't expect to see it back. He'll make a deduction for every favor, counting from the first one back. "Don't you remember when I did so-and-so for you?" I mean, not that that's what he'll tell you, but only to himself. Anybody claim a debt that you owe, you'll credit them blame. Calling me a hypocrite. - Hold, hold, hold the fuck on right there. Now, wait a minute, man. Now, what about that patient I sent you? After hearing his case, you tell me who I thought about. Who? Who could make all the money? You fucking cleaned up. Why should I expect anything? You're the motherfucking surgeon. You did all the work, even though not a damned thing was wrong with his neck. And why should you, huh? Nigga, I brought you a motherfucking goldmine. Now, you tell me if that had been you, you wouldn't have made some type of stake in that shit, some type of claim to find. And now, you want to talk about this piss-ass change I owe you. Motherfucker, I don't owe you a god-damned dime. - What I tell you? - No, no, the money ain't even the motherfucking point. The point is, it's that same thing with your woman. How high her legs are in there, I don't care. But you curse yourself every time you swear. - Wait, wait a minute. - What? Oh, it's alright for you to fuck other people's wives. You just don't want nobody fucking yours. - Well, as long as you're not fucking my wife, what business is it of yours? - How do you know I haven't? - [Group] Woah, woah, woah. - Somebody just tell me what the fuck is going on? - Look, wait everybody, just wait a minute. - Look, what are you trying to say? - What you misunderstood what I said? - No, motherfucker I didn't misunderstand a damned thing, but if you want to clarify, you go right ahead. - I ain't gotta clarify a damned thing, like I give a fuck what you think. - I warned you, motherfucker. Now, you want to test me? - It's that motherfucker who's you need to kick ass. - Everybody just calm the fuck down. - You better grab that motherfucker before I do. - Nigga, you ain't grabbing nobody, who? - Hey, look man, the man is fucking your wife, okay. That's who you need to choke. Choke him out. - No warnings, just ass whipping from here out. - What are you gonna do to me, sissy? Same thing you did to your woman's man? - [Samuel] On general principle, the motherfucker ought to be dead. - [Wesley] Son of a bitch, you go to far. - Hey look man, let him alone. That's what he needs to hear. Hey look man, cold-cock that punk when he's alone. - [Glenn] You better close your mouth. - Threatening is all you can do when all it takes is a little girl to cripple you. - What's gotta be wrong with you man? You go too far for what? - Look, anybody's a fool to sit on his hands. That's your woman, man. Take back what's yours. - No, he can't claim what ain't his. - Just shut up. All of you just shut the fuck up. - Fuck you, Wesley, fuck you. Bitch, I'll kill all of you motherfuckers, 'cuz that's just how I am, nigga, I don't care. You can call it genes. You can call it demons. You can call it personality. Apologize, for what, when it's a lie? Only apology you're gonna get from me is me pulling my motherfucking knife out your back, God-damned hypocrite. - No, you're gonna apologize, if I have to make you. - Bitch, you better move that motherfucking finger. - You gonna regret this day, from every day now on. - Just fucking shut up. - [Voiceover] Fellas, fellas. Can't we all just get along? Bitch, motherfucker. (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh, hey baby. Nothing. Nothing, just getting dressed. Oh, I'm getting ready to go do some dancing. Thought I would go out and do some dancing someplace. No, I don't know. Oh, is that your other line? Oh, okay baby. Yeah, for a while. - [Samuel] Don't tell me. - [Glenn] She got another call. Said she'd call back. - [Chris] And now she should be calling that motherfucker back. Instead she's calling you. - [Samuel] She's got your black ass on permanent hold. - [Wesley] That's patience right there. If you can't have patience, forget it. Then, you're losing control of yourself. - [Chris] Okay, well let's see how long you're waiting until your next call. Then, we're gonna see how patient you are. - [Wesley] You think, for once, that this nigga ain't patient? He's begging so hard, his knees are scraping up against the ground, just hoping, just one time, that that little phone will ring. It's all about control, can't you see. - [Chris] (mumbles) I'm telling you. You think she don't have control of him? - [Wesley] No, no, no, baby. Patience, please. - [Samuel] No, no, no, no, look bitch. You don't see him calling her, do you? - [Glenn] I don't call her for nothing. (R&B music playing) - [Chris] You think she's guilty. I mean, what happened between you two was because of what both of y'all did. You think she's sad right now? Nigga, don't even try and do that. And anyway, you said that you ain't did nothing, according to you. - What did you say? - What did I say, what? - [Glenn] Just now, what did you say? - What did I say about what? - I didn't do nothing, according to me, was what you said. - That's what you did. - [Chris] Yeah, well, nigga I could have said anything. So? - But you said according to me. - Well, what if I did? If I did, I was just repeating what you said. (laughing) - [Glenn] Uh, uh. I didn't do nothing, was what I said. But what you said was, according to me. What I wanna know is where you got that? - Does anybody know what this motherfucker is talking about? - According to me, means you got another side to compare. - He's saying you got another viewpoint from somewhere. - Like from who? - [Glenn] You know from who. - No, no, no, nigga. Take that look out your eye. - You know who. I'm asking you. - Yeah, well, nevermind what I said. You wanna know what I think? I think you're losing your God-damned mind. That's what I think. - You've been talking to her. - (scoffs) I ain't been talking to nobody, man. And wait, what if I was? What you gonna do to me? What, threaten me again? Is that all you can do? You gonna threaten me to death? - Don't get slapped. - Man, who's gonna get slapped? Anybody slap me'll be a dead motherfucker in this place. - It seems like you do a whole lot of threatening, too. - Man, nigga, just stay out of shit when ain't nobody talking to you. - You know what, man, I'll put my foot in your ass. - Yeah, well. Anytime you ready to die motherfucker, do it. - Well, fuck you, motherfucker. - Man, get your motherfucking shoe off of my chair. - Fuck you, bitch. Asshole. - [Voiceover] Every puzzle in its piece I have together now, and such adjoining. Now, I'm fit to kill. All together, with one slice missing out. Using to conspire secretly what alibi is about. My innocence is secure as lovers at first sight. I'll surprise you in your sleep, that you need never to wake. Stealing your life as you did mine, before you can suspect the crime. - [Voiceover] They talk about violence, like if it was something cool to do. Who among us can say there hasn't been a time when they weren't swept up in the thing? (cheering) (R&B music drowns out speech) - Take it out. All right, let's go. (music drowns out speech) (yelling) - [Man] Hold, hold, hold, hold up. Game over, my man. Woody Wood in the motherfucking house. - [Wesley] What's up with your shit man? - Man, fuck you. What's up with your shit? (laughing) - No, no, no. My boys are on their way. You motherfuckers got to bounce. - [Samuel] Wait, wait, wait a minute. This is a public park, nigga. (arguing) - What are you motherfucker, man. (punching thud) (kicking and screaming) - What does this have to do with OJ? What, you think he did it? - [Group] Hell yeah. - [Chris] Listen, man. Y'all are some fools, man. All of y'all, call yourselves black men. - How are you gonna rationalize so many coincidences? - It wasn't no fucking coincidences, man. Y'all just some sellouts. - OJ Simpson killed Nicole. - Oh man, that's a lie right there. - The brother was framed. - And that's exactly what he was. - They all, the police, in on this conspiracy. - Soon as a black man gets any amount of power, they just sneak up from behind and take it. - Don't let it be a white woman. - Oh, no, no. Then, you can kiss your black ass goodbye. - You let the police get away with that once, and pretty soon-- - Whether they guilty or not. - You got an authoritarian state. They can get anybody-- - I was an illegal search and seizure. - Anyplace, anytime. - Anybody that happens too white, the whole case gets thrown out. - Who knows from where the evidence, they got it. I mean, it's not their business to assume whether you're guilty or not. And for all of those years of lynching, Emmett Tills and everybody else. Hell, if he didn't do it, he might as well. - What about the DNA? - DNA? Hell. Now, they using micro-biotics to convict a black man. - The race card was played by the defense. - Whether you're poor, if you are black, you are a target. - And the phone calls. All what about? - You can't convict a black man by that. - She had kids with that man. Look, I might not have before, but now I understand. - So, you'd kill somebody, too - Who me? No. (laughing) - And just because I'd do it, don't mean that he did it. - That's right. - Could you do it? - [Glenn] Could I what? - Kill. - [Glenn] Kill somebody? - Why not? Why not you? Hmm. - [Glenn] Well, fuck no. Anybody I put my hands on wouldn't be her. - Now see, see how she got your mind being played? - Straight out. - [Glenn] Why? - [Chris] No, I'm gonna show you what I would have done if I was OJ. Look. (stabs table) That's what OJ (mumbles) - [Wesley] Fucker, what you think you're doing. Get the fuck off, you crazy bastard, man. Fuck you. - [Chris] I'm telling you don't touch my knife, man. Just because you happy right now, nigga, don't be surprised. - [Glenn] Don't be surprised, what? - Shit, she's setting you up, baby. - Man, the way she's got you, man. The way you feel right now, I bet you it's because that's how she want him to feel. - [Samuel] That's right. (rock music playing) (car doors slam) - Darling, you know how I feel. - Yeah, I know how you feel but don't worry about that. Everything's gonna be alright. - Your friends don't like me. - Come on, let's have a good time. - Wesley? - Misty. - I see some things never change. - You've not met Wesley's friends. - No, I heard about this. It's going to be cool. - Well, let me explain something to you about the food. It's a little different. It's going to be a bit greasy. There will be pig's feet. - Pigs feet? - Yes and I know they trot around in mud all day, but somehow they make it work. And collard greens. And at first I thought that they were spinach, but it's not spinach, actually. Not really, I mean, it's actually quite bitter. - Greens? - Girl, what do you know about collard greens? I'm a collard green fiend. Oh, girl. Don't trip. I grow collard greens. - Wesley! - [pink dress] Mmm, yum. - Damn, look at Glenn's girl. It looks like she got finer since she left that nigga. - [Friend] Damn, no, shit. Body is ridiculous, man. Preposterous. - It's ludicrous. - How long they've been broken up now, anyway? - Fuck how long. They broke up, man. Just because you step to his girl, don't mean you doing something wrong. - Nigga crying because he got soft shoes on and that's what wrong with the nigga. He's walking around with these soft shoes on, slippers even. (laughing) No I'm serious. You know what, see if it's me, you can't let a woman have that kind of power over you. - [Samuel] That's right. - [Friend] You know what I'm saying man? See, you gotta have cleats on at all times. - That's right. - You let a woman get over on you, nigga, she's gonna run you over every time. Man, how is Glenn, man? Anybody see him? - [Man] I don't want to see him. I ain't got time to sit around and watch no fool cry. (laughing) - Jeanette called me last night after talking with Brenda. - Mmm, girl. I heard. How is she? - Oh, you heard? - Mmm-hmm. - Wait a minute. What? - Charlie, drunk as usual, jumped up and popped her last night. - So, he hit her? - Wait a minute, on purpose? Why? - Why? Who gives a damn why? A man ain't got no business putting his hands on you. - He accused her of sneaking off. - Did she? - Miss Thing, it doesn't matter if she did the whole NBA. It don't matter. He still does not give them the right. - You see a brother down, you do nothing to encourage him and to help him. See, that's the difference between men and women. See, women stick together. - [Man] That's right. - [Man] See, I'm down for helping somebody, but, damn, it's been how long? - Too long. - It's ridiculous. - [Man] Pitiful hostage. - See, y'all niggas still tearing him down. A brother can't get up with another nigga tearing him down. Women, one of them see one of them down. Next thing you know they calling each other. "Girl, help. I need some help." There are even girls who don't like each other, will call each other to help. - She's over at Jeanette's right now trying to hide from him. - After that, she's gonna come and stay with me for a while. - Well, my old boyfriend, Lester, he's a supervisor up there at the firm. He'll get that dog fired. All she got to do is say the word. Lester do anything for me. - No, no, no. We shouldn't do anything just yet. We don't want to aggravate his attitude. - You know what, you're right. - And his temper, you know how they do. - Mmm-hmm, if we fight him too soon, he's gonna get suspicious and he might just think she's responsible. - [Woman] Yeah, you're right. Then, we should wait. That's right. - Yeah, because come a few weeks, he'll be in such bad shape when he gets his pink slip. He'll think it's his fault. Okay, he ain't gonna know what hit him. - He'll be so busy looking for a job, he won't be worried about who Brenda is doing or who she's seeing. - Okay, that's what it's all about. - [Glenn] And now for the good stuff. You know what, man. No more "I Love You's" is my weapon for her. You hear me? The only kiss she gets is in parting. - You really think she care? Well, what did she have to say? - [Glenn] Every word out of her mouth is a question in my mind. - Yeah, well, after my divorce, Kelly had the nerve to say she missed me one day. - [Wesley] She missed you? - She missed me. Ain't that a bitch? - [Wesley] Damn. - [Chris] I'm telling you, player, nothing I say to you about her can you even afford to second guess. - No matter if my thoughts embrace her all day, I can't be available anyway, yo. - Yeah, well, just don't get too comfortable, whatever you do. (R&B music playing) - Ooh, woah. He would never make love in the daytime. - Come on, never? - Uh, uh, believe me. That nigga made love like he was following a road map and if I turned the wrong way, he was lost. I mean, lost. - Not to change the subject, but you're talking about him again. - James, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it, alright? - You don't need to apologize. I ain't fading in the least. You better recognize. - Recognize? Recognize what? - Maybe there's something still there. (laughing) - How would that make you feel if it was? - The way I feel ain't got a damned thing to do with what anybody else is feeling. - You see, that's what I like about you. I mean, you understand my need to want to talk about that. - Always. - I think I love him. - Yeah, I know you do. It's not over, is it? - No, if it was over, I wouldn't be about to cry right now. Sorry, I kept you waiting. - Oh, that's okay. That's alright. Well, let me ask you something, though. Why couldn't I just have picked you up at home? - No reason. - I mean, you had to come this way, It was on your way. I mean, we could have come here together. Nobody would have had to wait for nobody. - It's no reason. We're here now, okay? - I guess, I guess you're right. I guess that's the main thing. So. What's the special occasion? I mean, usually when we get together, it's usually on me. - (laughing) It's gotta be on somebody. - I mean, what I'm saying is usually whenever we go out, I'm the one that makes the arrangements. - What difference does it make? - When was that, excuse me? - You know what? This has been going on too long. You know, there's the house that we didn't buy together, the trip to the Grand Cayman Islands. I mean, I don't get it. The French Riviera, we never did that. You know, what happened to all of those things? - Look, Shay. Sales are down at the office, okay? Okay, but look. Things are now finally starting to turn around for me. - And I've heard that before. How many times do I have to hear this, huh? - Look, how many times do I have to say it, huh? - You know, I don't see that there's a difference this time at all. You know, I don't expect anything from you. Nothing. - Shay, look, okay. I know you've been taking this hard, okay. But I promise you, Shay. Just give it a little more time. - (scoffs) Time? If I had time, but I don't have time. You know, I'm all timed out. - Oh, you're timed out? - Fresh out. - Oh, you're fresh out? No, I'm the one that's fresh the fuck out, okay? How about fresh out of my pocket, huh? How about fresh out of kicking my ass everyday, so you can just kick back, huh? How about fresh out of I'm tired of waiting on you to stop waiting on me? - It ain't about your money. - Oh, it ain't about the money - No, it's about me. - Look here, Shay. Don't do this to us. Give us a chance, Shay. - You know, what? I won't be at home tonight and you can pack your things and leave. - Shay. Okay? - Shay, I love you. The worst thing they say you gotta take is a lie. And the kindest gesture you gotta do just a lie. - [Wesley] Mmm-hmm, because you never know. - That's right. - Well, all I got to do is keep still and I got her on the go. - [Chris] Nigga, women are contrary, man. Don't you know that? You gotta treat a woman like she's some dirt in order for her to flower. - What? - Look at how you've been acting. I mean, what has it gotten you? Everything you've been doing. I mean, if you want to get a woman, you've gotta kick them in the teeth in order for them to know how to feel good. Then, say some shit like, "Pick that shit up off the floor "before it dirty the rest of the house." Adding a curse for good measure in between compliments, just to keep them off balance so they don't know where to go or who to turn to. Everytime, I guarantee you, they'll come running back for more. When they in front of they family, you gotta find fault with everything with them and I bet you that they will defend you to you, yours or anybody else who has anything to say against you. And then we're you're ready to go take care of your night business, you gotta be able to look them in the eye and smile and lie to them dead on. Until you can do that, your woman ain't ever coming back. - You weak, pathetic little man. Look you ain't any man. (R&B music playing) - [Voiceover] I don't wanna talk about it, but I gotta talk about it. And who else can I talk to, when I can't talk to her? Every time we speak, she drops me to my knees. - I've been missing you. - Everything's gonna be alright. - How do I know you won't all let it get to me. - Look in my eyes. You wanna know the truth? - Can you forgive me? I wanna trust you. What about retribution? - That's all over. - You know where I was last week? - What are they saying, my eyes? - The convention in Monterey. I thought of you the whole time. - Answer me. - You love me. - What else? - I wasn't alone. - Tell me. What else? - What? I don't know, what? - You know. - I don't k now what you're talking about. - I'm yours. - I was with him. It wasn't just a convention. - You must think I'm a fool. - I wanna be honest with you. - No, you wanna see me suffer, is all. - I didn't want you to find out later. - You wanted to see me when you said it. - You enjoy it. You satisfied? - I won't be satisfied until we're together. - Be my wife. - Go on and call her. See if she's at home right now. Let's see if you've got the courage for that. - I'd be weak to call. - [Chris] Don't give me that. - Yeah, well, I called my girl like that one time. She picks up the phone and she says, (groaning) (laughing) Not right now. Call me back. Yeah, I sure the fuck did. (laughing) - Look. look, look, look. What's the difference to phone, huh? Anything she's doing is regardless to all that shit. - No, no, no. The phone is a reminding fact, man. That used to be his number that he's calling. You know, that was your phone number. And somebody else is probably calling right now. - [Wesley] Chill on the brother. Whatever he does, why don't you just leave him alone. - Hey, he can express his views the same as you, motherfucker. - Why don't you just stay out of this? - What, now you're threatening me? Ain't this some shit. Huh? What, you done mustered up some balls somewhere? - Look, I'm just telling you, is all. - You don't tell me shit. - [Wesley] Well then, tell everybody. - I'll tell you. - Well, tell everybody what the fuck you gonna do. - What you trying to do, man? What you turning the other cheek today? - I'm not gonna do nothing. What you gonna do? - Don't think this martyrdom shit is going to bring this ass whooping to quit. - [Wesley] Fuck you, then do it, huh? Do it, motherfucker. - Nevermind your brazen chest, or your puffed up chin, or your courage. All the rest. You all die the same. The worst that you could imagine, you have not imagined yet. Defenses against rage, that's a corpse's jest. You look at me as easy prey. I look at you and see what I have yet to do. And don't bother to look. You will see me again. Gradually and by degrees you will be destroyed. I will wrench your heart of its last drop of blood for harms that it offered me in mourn. (moaning) (hip-hop music) (grunting) - Yeah. (moaning) How long do you expect me to wait? (hip-hop music playing) - [Voiceover] The phone, nothing but a curse. Standing there. See how it's taunting me? I can't move, standing here with my insides all choked out. How come nobody told me it was even possible to feel this way? Sam could take it. Even Wesley. So, what the hell's wrong with me? I can't even look at my friends knowing exactly what they see, a sorry ass fool with spit all over me. How could this happen? Somebody explain that shit to me. She waylaid me, while we were still together. While we were still a couple, she lay in waiting, storing up, waiting for the day when she would hit me. I was still loving her. That's the part that gets me. We had stuff that was only us, that nobody knew. And that she could plan this after all that. Woo. No wonder I'm so fucked up. I'm scared to leave the house in case she calls, in case this once she'll listen, in case my words land just right. "I love you." I want to say. "How are you?" is all I can. - Daddy, where are you? (R&B music playing) (screaming) (laughing) - [Wesley] Yeah, that's what I thought so, too. - You lucky I don't bust a cap off in your bitch ass. - [Wesley] Fuck you, niggas. - Alright, ya'll. Quit hogging up the opportunity to talk. Give somebody else one. - [Wesley] Samuel, I tell you what happened to me? Hmm? White girl from Switzerland, I tell you? - No. - I ain't tell you this? - No motherfucker. - Well, no, no, no what, what now? Tell us, who now? - Well you know Richelle and I were planning on getting back together for weeks. So she finally let me know, just because we getting back together don't mean she's letting her new man go. - Oh ain't that a bitch. (laughing) - She actually did that shit? (laughing) - That's criminal man. - No, no, she has the nerve to sit me down to tell me what type of nigga he was, damn. - Oh, man. - And yet, you know I wish a woman would do some shit like that to me man. Drop that bitch off a freeway. (laughing) - The other day, I told baby I was going out with somebody new even though it wasn't true. (laughing) - Even though she really is (laughing). - Whoa! Uh oh. (laughing) - You know what though? Man, everything she do, see it go through her mind. 'Cuz she got to wonder if I'm doing the same thing too. - Now I caught myself getting back at this one time girl I had for what she did to me. Swore on my grave that I was gonna make her pay. So I saved paycheck after paycheck, 'til that final payday. - That's the Hawaii? - Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, Hawaii, the Waikiki, Kiki Palace. Her favorite best place in the whole wide world. Now we had been split for a while then, by then, right. So when I gave her the ticket, she says, "Fine". (laughs) Now, martinis, dinner by the shore, the whole nine yards right. But now it's time to go back to the room, I'm tired. We say our good night and you know, see you later, you know, the whole thing. She go to her room, I go to my room. She close her door, I close my door. But oh, a brother didn't have to wait long. Mmm, 'cuz I was ready. Here she come, tap, tap (knocking). She comes in, and butt naked, freestyle on the floor with a hotel call girl. (laughing) The look on her face was worth the ticket alone. (exhales sharply) but damn, a brother had a high price the next day to pay. But from the racket coming from her headboard outta her room, that's the full day's and more. (laughing) - Fuck that man, I'd a been making noise even if I had to pretend, doing some shit like this, you know. - Hell or got a different room. - (chuckles) Something. (laughing) - Ah, when Shelia and I was breaking up, this motherfucker called the house one day. Tell me to get my punk ass up and put that bitch on the phone, just like this, right. - [Glenn} Damn. - I say, "What?" He said, "Nigga, you heard what I said. "Put that bitch on the phone." So I say, "The fuck is this?" 'Cuz I wanted to know, you know. The motherfucker said, "Nigga, this is me Bobby D. "B-O-B-B-Y D." Huh, ain't that a bitch? - [Glenn] Yeah you know one of your girls must have called her like that. - You want to know where it came from? That's where it came from. - Yeah, you do some shit like that you better be prepared. - Yeah, 'cuz it's coming back. - Hell yeah. - Coming back. - Please believe. - (chuckles) You see, they mark their territory with that phone. (R&B music) - He don't want her back. Look at her. Everything he does is the wrong thing to do. He can't move in to embrace her without her turning away. And every time he goes to hold her he just gonna let go. Wow, okay, you can't let your good girl have everything she wants all the time. And every time he tells you something different, deep down, he lying. (doorbell ringing) - Hey come on, the door's open. - Hey Samuel. - Donna, hey how you doin'? I didn't expect to see you here. How's everything? - Good, but you know why I'm here? - No, don't tell me, let me guess, Wesley. - Mmm. - Come one in. - (sighs) Samuel I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. - Come on Donna, dude's a fool for you and you know it. - But nothing I say makes any difference to him. - Look, can I get you something to drink? Juice, soda, beer? - Yes, thank you. You're his friend, what can I do to make him understand that there's nothing there for me? - Oh that's funny, you doing everything you can to make him understand it's over, and he's doing everything to make you understand that it's not. - Yeah but you know you have to realize something it was never that serious. - Just don't tell him that, all right? - Mmm-mmm. I want you to tell him that. You can tell him that I only showed interest in him so that I could get to know you. And how I bided my time with him, waiting for this moment to be with you. - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, now I don't know what you heard okay. Shay and I got our problems, but this ain't one of 'em. - (scoffs) So what are you saying? Hmm? - What I'm saying-- - Mmm-hmm. - What I'm, what I'm saying is no. - You bitch and stop looking at my ass. (R&B music) - And she put him through a whole lot of things. That I can empathize with. But there is one thing that he's got to understand, for some reason, he's not. - I'm listening. - It's her pussy. (R&B music playing) - Oh my God, I forgot. You were kissing me and I forgot. - What good is that? - [Voiceover] Yeah he finally got his shit on there, a hickey. Okay that's some shit. What is that? - [Glenn] You bad. - [Wesley] He's bad, whoa. - [Chris] Oh, why can't I play that? - [Glenn] (mumbles) shuff up, shuff up. - [Voiceover] What I'm saying is nothing. - [Donna] You bitch, stop looking at my ass. He was there all right. And somebody else too. - What? - [Woman] Oh, that's it, mmm. Any making up he thought was gonna go on, he can forget it now. - He was with another woman? - Yep. - [woman] I thought you all had plans? - [leather jacket] Yeah, he had plans all right. He planned that shit all the way there. - [Woman] Oh wait a minute, back up. - That fucking puto. - [leather jacket] Yeah right. - [Woman] What? - I'm so damned pissed I don't know what to do. - [leather jacket] You don't do anything, that's what. You don't call, you don't return his phone calls. And if you see him in public, play it off like you never even knew. And if he wants to make plans, let him make plans all day long. But you don't have to follow through. - Amen. - Si, si, I did the same thing to Lonnie Black. Some type of fag, had that punk meeting me all over town, for dinner, for drinks. Each time I'd say, "Oh I don't know what happened, "but next time, I'm there." Mmm, puto right now probably waiting for me somewhere (laughing). - Oh girl, you'll be okay though. - What about it. - [Waitress] Here we go ladies, your drinks. - Thank you. - [Waitress] Like these, ready to order? - [Glenn] I wanna see, 'cuz I'm really close here. - [Chris] Hey man you just watch out. - [Wesley] Go ahead and pass, you know you wanna pass. - [Chris] Man shut up. - I'm a tell you what the last time I did. All right? That, it was Father's day a matter of fact. Now she invited me over to her place to spend the day because of that, right. But I was back with my family, it felt so good my defenses was down, you know. She started complimenting so I started complimenting back. You know what I'm saying? 'Cuz I could she wanted me, it wasn't hard to tell. But I insisted no, you know? Well I stood my ground there too. I'm telling you it was all I could do to hold back. - (grunts) You held back? - Wait a minute, what you mean, you held back? - I held back. You know. - [Chris] What you hold back? - I didn't go as far as I, you know, as I could. (laughing) - You didn't put in you mean. - You got to understand man, I wasn't going back to that feeling, you know, being dismissed, but it was all I could do to resist. - So what'd you do? - Kept his clothes on. (laughing) - Oh is that all? (laughing) You know what, I should of expected that shit from you. - But I did for a while, but it was good. But still I'm not going back to that feeling, for my decency's sake, so I kept a shred. - [Chris] So what did you do? - Because the minute you go all the way the power has shifted control. - And they know it too. Sit back and smoke a cigarette on you. - Yeah that's just what they will. - Ah, and then by then, she started to bed. - This motherfucker, you believe this shit? - She did man but my mind was made. Look it's surprised me I did what I did. - Aw, what the hell did you do? - [Wesley] Yeah, what the hell? - I held back. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You holdin' back now huh? What else did you hold back Glenn? - Nigga you full of shit. - You fuck somebody or either you don't. - Wait, wait, you held back what? - No, no, no, no, no, what the fuck he got to hold back? - Listen, did you put it in? - Not all the way. (laughing) - That little piece of shit you got? The moment you put that motherfucker in you go straight to the back. - I didn't put it in, not really. - Oh please you a God-damned liar. - (chuckles) How did you do it? What'd you do? - What? I kept my underwear on, all right? Now how you like that? Didn't take it out, I refused. And she came two times like that. - Fuck you man, that, that, that, what was that? Father's day right? That was two months ago. - [Voiceover] But this dude's crazy. Some people you can talk to, but him, he's never gonna change. - [Glenn] You scared that's all, you scared. - I'm sorry you want to sit down? - [Woman] Oh no I'm fine. - Oh, oh, you gotta excuse my manners, I ain't see you, you know. - No really I wouldn't want to trouble you. - Baby ain't no trouble at all. Actually, you know, you can, you can share it. - How? - You can sit on my lap. Come on baby I'm just trying to be polite. - No that was so disrespectful. - Wait, wait, how is that disrespectful? All I asked, I just posed the question. - You just being rude and indecent. - No, hypothetically, that's what, you know, if I did something it'd be different, I ain't do shit. - Mmm-mmm, you know what, you're just a sorry excuse for a gentleman. - You know what, take the fucking seat. Yeah, can't even make fun of, and fucking eating too. Shit, sit your ass down. - [Wesley] I like that shit. - All right gimme this, gimme something, fuck it. Man, fuck that, bitches man, I'm telling you. It's, man hell no, you ain't never gonna catch me being punked out by some hoe. You know what I do to a hoe? This what I did to this one bitch one time. I took this hoe for everything she had in her crib. Everything. I left only two things for her. A toothbrush and a roll of film. Her toothbrush, you know, you know what she saw when she developed that roll of film? - Mmm? - Her toothbrush sticking straight out my black ass. (laughing) - But man, you made that shit up. - No it takes a sick motherfucker to think of some shit like that (laughing). - (laughing) Whoever thought of it, I take off my hat. - And you made that up. - Yeah you're right, that's some bullshit. That's like that Father's day shit man. I think that's some bullshit too. Who gonna let you fuck 'em with your drawers on? - Come on man, what you trying to do? - [Glenn] What? - Well I'm just saying, you know, you need to get a motherfucking ass grip. - Listen, everything she's done to me is not what I do. When she don't know where to find me, now she has to imagine all the lurid details. - Yeah, she ain't gotta imagine a damn thing all she gotta do is look at them mirrors on the ceiling. - Mmm-hmm but look out that she don't catch your game. - No shit, better cuddle up real tight. - Keep it all outta sight 'cuz there won't be no getting her back if she knew. - She might already do. - [Samuel] You have to make her a sex tape or something for her to believe. - Man, shit, you want everybody to believe that you so confident and high man, but I know better baby. - How do you know anything? - Shit, just looking at you I can see. - Oh, what is the problem with you? - Oh well, well pick you the phone man, nevermind what I said. - I ain't got to pick up a damn thing. - No, pick up the phone, let's see. - No, 'cuz I knew you were scared. - Why should he be? - Who said he was scared? - I said it, me. You know you want to, pick up the phone. - Why don't you just chill out on the brother? - Talking about how bad he is, well, let's see then. - Scared of what? Why should he be? - He quaking in his boots, scared to death. Scared that she might not be home. Or that she might be home but be a little busy. - Yeah well what fucking difference does it make you? - Just scared of the truth, that's all. - I don't see the big fucking deal. - (chuckles) He can't do it. - Yeah that's character, something you don't know shit about. - No a weak character, that's what he is. - Yeah motherfucker, I said chill. I mean what is it you trying to prove? - What am I? What are you?
