This film is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents are a product of filmmakers' imagination. Honorable citizens of Korea, it's been 20 years! 20 years since I dove into the world of politics, I, Jeon Hae-woong, will become a congressman. I may not have much, but I will not compromise to lies and injustice, and I'll become a just politician who will side with the weak! With a landslide victory, I will thank and repay you for your votes! This is not my victory alone, it is our victory, moreover, it will be a victory for Republic of Korea's democracy! Well, well... "Republic of Korea" seems too much. Korea's democracy Busan March, 1992 Presidential and general elections will be held together this year for the first time since the constitution was established. To capture the popular sentiment, many new policies are being introduced. President Roh Tae-woo is touring the country, and presents various redevelopment plans, and vows to turn Metropolitan Busan into a top-class international city. Jesus Christ. Redevelopment is always part of every election campaign. Do they also plant trees that grow money? Sons of bitches. They'll announce it, jack up the land value, kick out the residents! And they'll fill up their own pot bellies, not? Those bastards... Am I right, Rep. Jeon? They can't redevelop on a whim like they did before. The world has changed, and so has Democratic Party. And Busan's Haeundae has me, what's there to worry? Is this better? You're the problem! Because pricks like you are getting into politics! Honey, long time no see... See? That's what you say to your wife? Honey bun, don't say that on this wonderful day. How about we take 10? You two can chat... Good! Break time. No, let's just get it over with, I'm busy. - Hurry, hurry. - She's busy. - Busy? - Yeah, very. - I'll stand on this side. - Yes, very nice. All right, one, two. Raise your hand. Come home for once, mother's sick. Again? Probably faking it since she misses you. All right, that's enough. She must really love her son who doesn't make any money. Come on, smile. You'll be the wife of a congressman soon. Once I get this win, you'll get your own driver. I'll also win 3, 4 terms and more! I don't need all that, just get your shit together. Can't we live ordinary lives? I'm not doing this for my own sake. - It's for the good of Korea... - Are we done? Yeah, done, all done. Yeah, I guess so... - We got plenty. - More than enough. Very well. Leaving so soon? Not gonna have lunch? This is for meals, not booze! It's a sure thing, once I get the party nom. A nomination equals elected! Let's take 5. She's usually very respectful. Haeundae Residential Development Approved! Compensate Residents Fairly! - Look who it is! - Good to see you. - Welcome! - Thank you. Good work. Hello, nice to see you. Hello there. - Hey, Hae-woong! - Let's go up. - You must be tired. - Not at all. Redevelopment? Is that as easy as drawing a line on a map? So what's happening now? Even the president is floating the idea! What will happen then? All the rich folks in the country, developers and big construction companies will zero in! So, what do we do about it? They'll come with bundles of cash and shovels! Should we sell our land? No way! Don't ever sell your land and resist at all costs! Who will be kicked out of our homes? Us! - Who'll get the boot? - Us! - Who? - Us! - Madame, who? - Us! When I'm elected, I'll become the voice of you all, and fight this with everything I got! Good! You're the only one on our side! Thank you! Hae-woong's the best! Jeon Hae-woong! Jeon Hae-woong! Seoul March 1992 $500M? Combined with general election, we're looking at $1B. Don't you know the legal limit for presidential campaign fund? It's under $40M, $36.7M to be exact. What kind of idiot put on a campaign with that money? Losing the general election means losing the presidential election. It's the end of the world as we know it. Busan Metropolitan City Development Proposal This is our only option at the moment. Use this to for seed money, and once we increase the ratings, corporations will back us. Busan port is at its limit, so development is crucial, therefore it'll be easy to rake in the funds. I'll gather some VIPs from there. I'll go there myself. There is someone who controls Busan. His name is Kwon Soon-tae, money or land, everything goes through him. Are we in the '70s? You can't dabble into everything. You must focus on one district to get the cash flowing. Haeundae Development Amended Proposal This is the only one right now. What? Haeundae? Wait, rezone this district? It's the cream of the crop. Should I work up a storm in the whole city then? You up for it? No, that's not what I meant... Let's do it his way. We are in a state of emergency. We must trust Mr. Kwon's judgment. To that end... CV: Jeon Hae-woong let's fix the election first. What are you doing? Our work can't be done by just anybody. But the nomination will be announced in 2 days... This is Park Yong-sik, he's obedient and kind. He passed the bar while attending Seoul U. But even so... He's a newbie! I will get it done. - Director Moon. - Sir? Got any insider tip? Buy some land behind the bowling alley in Jaesong. Why? What's up? Don't ask any questions, just buy some. That's the place? Yes, that's the place. Good evening. Look who it is! Rep. Jeon is here! - Good to see you. - Have you been well? You came! I'm sorry for being late, sir. Not at all. You're bound for greatness, just you being here is a boon. - Hey there. - Hello. - Rep. Jeon. - Sir. Hey, it's been a while, I heard you were busy. You're the busiest man, and he's second. I'm not that busy at all. Good to see you here. When you go to the congress, it'll be harder to see you. I'll have to visit more often. Very good. Alums have to stick together and help each other out. Yes, that's right! I'm so proud of you two. You're the real stars of Busan. Not at all... Speaking of which... Attention everyone! Hae-woong, come on, get up. Yes, of course. Our proud alum Jeon Hae-woong, will be running for office at the 14th general election! I'll do my best! All right! Raise your glasses! - We're no! - Strangers! Why didn't she put it away? I'm just saying you got a cute kid. Don't you pull that gangster crap on me! What's going on, honey? Hey! Let go of her! - Let go! - Your daddy's here. Let her go! Let her go, asshole! Who the hell are you? Your creditor, obviously! Creditor? Screw that! Get over here! Don't be so touchy, you disgusting pig. Do you know who I am? How dare you come here! Honey! Let go of me! What are you doing to our VIP? It's not like we're hooligans. But we're... - Let me help you up. - Piss off! Is he okay? My apologies. My boys are a bit on the dumb side. But Rep. Jeon, what'll you do? We lend you the money as a show of support thinking that you'd get the nomination. But that went to shit, too bad for you. Nomination? What did you say? Are you nuts? You didn't know? You're not in the know? You're in politics, no less. Politics isn't some bandwagon, how do you just kick someone off overnight? I'm lost for words! Mr. Kwon! This is the crappiest horse shit I've ever heard, spill it! You didn't listen and blabbered on to the residents. If I'm not siding with them, why am I in politics? Listening to people's wailings is politics? Is that how I taught you? So you replaced me with an obedient dog? You know the pawns in chess? Do you know what they're for? You use them and kill them when you want to. Are you saying I'm a pawn?! What did you think you were? Jesus, this really hurts. You didn't know? The world is dirty, and life's a bitch. Wait, no, I... How many years have I cleaned your shit? A while. Sir, this is all wrong, let's start over, okay? Mr. Kwon, this is Haeundae! I will not lose to some nobody in this district, you know that. Help me out. I, Jeon Hae-woong, will kneel before you! First time, right? Please help me. Kneeling really isn't a big deal. I got nominated thanks to you, I'm Park Yong-sik. Jeez... You should've mentioned my replacement was here. Let's get it on then. It'll be fun. Why? Why?! Why?! Let's see who drops dead first! Let's do it! Haeundae Development Proposal Confidential The Devil's Deal This is an atomic bomb. When this blows up, it won't be just us who get screwed. The entire country will go up in flames. $300,000 in a week, good? In addition to that, I should be getting a promotion. Sunjin Venture Capital So? Came to make a payment? What are you doing?! Having lunch? Yeah, want some? It's okay, but we need to talk. Lend me a million more. Politicians sure are on a different scale. You got a big appetite and even bigger balls. Mr. Kim. Once I'm elected, I'll pay back 10 folds, no, 100 folds. We're both pros here. What can you do in Busan as an independent? I've been around the block a few times here. I will never lose to a nobody. Sure, I know that, but... But us businessmen don't trust people. To be frank, $1M is like 10 apartments. People in politics tend to underestimate money. We make money by getting stabbed and going to jail. How long will you live by sucking blood? Here. CONFIDENTIAL Haeundae Development Proposal They're worth $500M minimum, a few billion in the long run. Go in before the dig, and you'll make gangbusters. Is this for real? Why? You don't believe me? Think carefully now. Once I get my gold badge, you'll be on a high-speed gravy train. Let's throw in $2M more. We gotta go big to clench the win. I'll make the connection. Mr. Jung, good to see you. Hey. Say hello, this is candidate Jeon Hae-woong. I finally get to meet a local celebrity. It's an honor. Yellow Dragon Development's Jung Han-mo. Good to meet you. You two know the situation, let's get to the point. Pil-do, you're a big boy now, taking the lead here. If you're appreciative, just say so. Keep it up and you may regret it. And the one leading isn't me, it's candidate Jeon. All right, let's talk business. Certainly, take a look at this first. It's a hot intel straight from the city hall. As you can see, these are nothing but cream. Once he's elected, these will be top priority, and it'll be a gold mine once apartments go up. Let's see... This is here? So beautiful! I won't have to worry about the permit? I'll get it done no matter what. Okay, let's do it. With that, let's get drunk, in an epic fashion. - Epic fashion. - Let's do it. One, two, three! A New Face of Politics, Jeon Hae-woong Independent Office of Jeon Hae-woong As the son of Haeundae, I've taken to the street with your trust! I will protect Haeundae and Busan with everything I got! Please breathe courage into me! Jeon Hae-woong! Jeon Hae-woong! Jeon Hae-woong! Y'all listen now. Even shit has different grades. Not all thugs are cut from the same cloth. You are all now working for the country, so have some pride, and act accordingly. - Got that? - Yes, boss! Pour them. $30 into white envelope, $50 into yellow envelope, count properly. Yes, sir! I said, $30 into white envelope. Don't get confused and count properly! With the general election approaching, campaigns are in full swing, President Roh proclaimed that it will be the cleanest, fairest general election in history. He has also pleaded not to shower gifts at campaign and party events. Chungeum Apples So, redevelopment can't be stopped. If it's inevitable, allow me to be elected, and I'll make sure that you, you and you, all get apartments in the new city! - Right! Right! - So right! So have fun, and once you're back, meet the neighbors one at a time and convince them. Do you understand? Don't you worry about a thing, here, have a drink. Thank you! Let's all raise our glasses! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Jeon Hae-woong! - Jeon Hae-woong! Good morning, Mr. Jeon. We will need a traffic light there. A reporter is here for you. Gosh, sorry to keep you waiting. We had to tour the Jaesong district. So, you're the reporter, huh? They sent a nobody... How long have you worked as a reporter? 2 years now. Is that a problem? No, why'd that be a problem? To be honest, aren't you the bigger nobody? You're a feisty one. How did you fail to clench the Democratic Party nom? I really like you, Ms. Song Dana. How should I put this, it could be interpreted as difference in vision. - A cup of coffee? - Yeah, sure. I heard you were kicked out? That is one interpretation of what happened. The real truth is, it was a textbook case of nepotism, during the time when the president is proclaiming that he only wants "fair election." I'm the victim of political machination. You must've felt wronged, you're just a naïve sheep. It's all right. I'm not someone who dwell on the past. There's bound to be trouble when our goals don't align. A man of justice who threw away vested rights? That's not bad. How about something that encapsulates my life... Champion of democracy, yeah, let's go with that. - Champion of democracy. - Yeah, that's right. When I was in college, I participated in protests. I get cold sweat thinking about those days. I fought and struggled for democratization, with red bandanas, screamed my lungs out. Singing for our freedom... Bullshit! Singing for our freedom... Daily Busan - Editorial Dept. Look at this. Why are you so desperate to bury someone? Is that what you learned first? You said a reporter must be good at one of two things: suck up or blow off the cover. Didn't I also mention balance and timing? There's time for everything! And this is for your own damn good. For our own sake, you took money from Jeon? How dare you! Who took whose money? And chief, don't ask me to do this again, I'm allergic to bullshit. This isn't school, you can't do whatever! Candidate 4 Jeon Hae-woong Revolt of the Independent, Candidate Jeon Hae-woong Haeundae Independent Jeon Pushes Forward Squall in Haeundae! Jeon's All Out Offensive Candidate 4, you know, right? It's all over, candidate 4! Vote for candidate 4! Park Yong-sik I Need Your Support Don't move, assholes! Next up is Busan. As expected, Democratic Party is winning the entire region, and only Haeundae is led by independent Jeon Hae-woong. Yay! Jeon is Haeundae! Jeon Making Big Strides Mr. Jeon, take a look at this! We're in the lead! First! Jeon Hae-woong! Jeon Hae-woong! Jeon Making Big Strides Set up a meet. No need for that, sit down. So I hear your daughter's sick. Yes, it's her heart... Oh dear. That poor kid. I heard a transplant is difficult in Korea. Yes, there is no donor. I felt bad, so I looked into this, I hear it's easily done in United States. But I don't have the money, and it's more expensive for foreigners too. It's about saving a child, why is money important? I'll make sure she gets it. Pardon? But you'll have to do something in return, Mr. Park. This is way above my pay grade. I think you're gravely mistaken about something. I'm not asking. Haeundae District Election Commission Voter List - CONFIDENTIAL Did you catch a lot? Yes, welcome. - You take care now. - Bye. It's hot. Okay, thank you. Delivery complete. 33! Yes, sir. Unload. Ballot Box 1. Park Yong-sik 4. Jeon Hae-woong Youngjin Art Class You are finally back home! I've been busy at the camp... It's raining, stay over night. If you say so... It's raining cats and dogs. Still working? Is our son asleep? The election's tomorrow. I know. Will you vote for me? No. I feel bad for people with you in the congress. I knew you'd say that. Honey, there's nothing to it. Once I'm elected, I'll get you a workshop, and let you paint your heart's desire. I can at least support you that much. Promise me one thing. What? This is for the last time, or it's a divorce. Win. We have a confirmed winner. 49.7% of votes in Haeundae, Busan, went to Park Yong-sik of Democratic Party. Independent Jeon Hae-woong took in 33% of the votes. Next is Gyeonggi province, Seongnam District... - Hey, leave it on. - What's the point? Mr. Jeon was watching. - It'll just hurt him more. - It's not over, turn it on. They said it's confirmed. Madame, good to see you. You all did great work, let's have a drink. Honey, come here! You didn't have to buy so much. Take this, put it there. Here, you all worked so hard. Thank you! Losing is one thing, we still have to go on. You're so right! This isn't the end of it, let's have a drink. That's right, 4 years is short. We fought hard for an independent! Yeah, that's right. Shit, even your assholes are filled with hope. "Fought hard"? When you fight and lose, you either become a cripple, die, or die as a cripple. You sure take this freaking lightly. Buddy, don't talk shit! Are we gangsters? What's the difference? I've had it with you, shut your damn mouth! Our high and almighty candidate Jeon. I'm sorry that I raised my voice as a classless gangster! You son of a... I'm gonna keep living my life as a son of a bitch, so stay in politics, yeah? Don't forget about our arrangement. Have a great drink. I should run for office too. Oh my... Thank you, I'll forever be loyal to you. Be loyal to the country. That's your job. Thank you. Look who it is. Welcome, Mr. Moon. First time seeing me? Yes, who are you? I'm just a servant of this country. Haeundae Development Amended Proposal Wait, but how is this... I'd like to give you an order. Pardon? An order? Allow me to make some adjustments. We've already talked to the men upstairs. But it's already finalized, and the announcement will be made in 2 days. If we make sudden amendment, we'll be audited for sure! Audit? What's this? That's your car, right? $140K worth of stocks under your kid's name, $5-600K worth of land under your mother-in-law. What's your salary? Want to taste the real audit? Haeundae Land Development Metro Busan Land Development went through 3 phases of planning in order to turn Busan into 21st Century's greatest port city. Over 33,400 residences will be built... It's me, can you send 3 Jeeps? I'll pay on site. See you there. Where is he? You're so screwed, aren't you? Get the hell up, man! Huh? Development Proposal Announced What... What's this? The land you said to buy up became worthless. I never imagined that I'd get conned by a hooligan and a politician. Mr. Jung, I'll look into what happened, give me some time. Listen, ex-candidate Jeon, here's the thing about business, sincerity equals confidence. Paying back 10% of the money would sprout some confidence. You know my situation, give me some time. This isn't urgent. It's not like the land will go away! I'm doing this because I know your situation. I gotta check whether you got a way to produce money! You ain't a bitch, putting together $200K is easy! Do me this favor. Before lunch time tomorrow. Come on, man... Oh, and don't look for Pil-do. What a goddamn moron... Even dogs and cats are getting into politics... It's up to you to kill the minions or not. But capture Pil-do alive no matter what. Got that? Yes, sir. Go. What the hell?! Go to hell! Goddamn! Sons of bitches! You okay, boss? Jesus Christ... Oh yeah, my bag. Holy crap, what is it? Let's take a trip. What? Where? Hold on... If you want to live, just drive. Okay, I'll drive... 2 trucks en route, sir. How many? 140 boxes today. They'll arrive in Seoul at 4 AM, and the next shipment in a week. Good job, treat your boys to a round of steaks. Hello, this is Busan. Not at all. It's all for the greater good. Please send my regard to the old man. $42M in 140 boxes Minister Kim Kyung-hoon Come on in. Welcome. Have a seat. What's going on? Take it off. There's something I really don't understand. I want you two to clear things up for me. All right. Let's hear it. We dug your treasure map, but found nothing. It's not the only new city being developed in Busan, there are so damn many! And you alone took money from everywhere! How will you help me untangle the mess you made?! What about me?! Me! I'll cough up the money you gave me then! Can't you see that I'm in a predicament right now?! Do you even know what a predicament is?! Then what? What do you want me to do? I got an order from upstairs! What am I supposed to do?! Who? Upstairs who? I don't know! How would I know?! I've never seen him before... - Son of a bitch... - You bastard! To be goddamn honest, you didn't get elected! You ain't got the power to protect me! Goddamn you! Is that why you started licking someone else's asshole?! It hurts, my head... Here, give it a go. What? Don't just talk the talk, mess him up for real. Let's see if you got your story straight with him. What do you take me for?! Then you have to prove yourself, am I right? You'll really kill him! We still need information. Let go of me! Get him! Piss off, asshole! You took me for a swindler? You bastard! Shit, let go. That's enough, stop it! Get off of me. You two, follow my orders. I have a plan, follow my orders to the tee, you hear me?! I'll take full responsibility! All right. It's all settled then. - Good morning. - Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Ms. Song! One moment, please? Yes? Say hello, you've met him. Have you had breakfast? I don't eat breakfast. Let's go have a meal, brunch then. Go with him, he's got a tip. A tip of public interest. If you had enough, can we start? May I record? Not gonna have more? Very well, here, write exactly as is. I'm too old for dictation. Give it a read, don't drop your jaw in shock. $160M minimum, plus some extra. Proposed new city plan was changed overnight. By Korea's top or just below him. It's not even surprising, really. Same things happened for Gangnam in the '70s. Who's the whistleblower? I can vouch for the source, so don't worry about that. What about the evidence? Once you open this, you and I are on the same boat. CONFIDENTIAL What you're holding is the original copy. I talked to your editor, put it on the morning edition. Hello? It's me, Mr. Jeon. I still haven't got a payment, I don't know what to do. I'm looking into the matter, please be patient. I'll take care of it. I know a prosecutor, so I came to his office. I'm gonna smoke a cigarette, I hope I get an answer before I finish. Why are you doing this? Will this get you money? I have to find a way to make a living, no? One went dark, the other's being stubborn, as a powerless citizen, the law's my only defense, no? They'll pick up a few charges, such as illegal election, fraud, leaking official document, what else is there? You'll regret this. This would be threat and intimidation. Son of a bitch, you listen now. How'd a gangster feel when he's stabbed? You messed with the wrong man. I'll pay you back hundred, thousand times, asshole. Oh gosh, I finished my cigarette. Mr. Jung... Son of a bitch... Prosecutor Kim Kwang-du Okay, I get the gist of what you're saying, but why are you doing it this way? What? I mean, Jeon didn't get elected, legally speaking, you'll be charged with providing slush funds, and bribery charges. You're turning yourself in. Listen, in business terms, this is an act of fraud. He's guilty of leaking official documents, no? Pil-do, it's me, listen carefully. Jung spilled his guts to a prosecutor. Under the circumstances, when this blows up, we'll... That's right. I'll wrap this up with the chief prosecutor, and you standby until Jung comes out... Yeah, okay. Pil-do, wait. Make absolutely sure to keep a lid on your men and... - Sir! - Hey there! - You came by? - Sure did. What happened to your face? A ton of things are all tangled up. Is that so? Have you been well? Of course. But I feel bad for the election. Well, things happen. Before that, do you know prosecutor Kim Kwang-du? I already talked to him. Why is Jung doing this? I think we had some misunderstanding. That can happen when men work together. Should I go mess him now? I'd be so grateful, sir. Yeah, come in! - Did you call for me? - Hey. - Sir. - Good. You know him, right? He's our alum. Yes, but I never got to introduce myself, my apologies. There's no better time than now for that. I'll look this over later, why don't we go out for dinner? Yes, have a meal, and have some fun. Prosecutor Kim, do you like sports? Sports? What was her name? Jane? Yeah! Jane! Jane, Jane! Please come this way. Sir, let's go in. - Welcome. - Hey there. Let's go inside. - I'm here. - Good evening. Which room? - I'll see you later. - Have a great time, sir. Over here, he's the VIP. - Good evening. - Hello. 5th Race Betting Form Take your clothes off. My clothes? I'll hang it for you. Is this your first time here? Yes... Do you see this? The highlighted lines? 8th and 7th horses? Bet as much as you want. Horse Betting All the bets for the 5th race. 5th race. 5th race is starting. Betting Slip 8, 7: $300 Hey, prosecutor Kim will call you later, he said you should head home. What? Mister? Hey! Goddamn... Korea's a goddamn mess! These pricks are taking me for a fool. Hello, this is Busan MBS tip line. Hello, good day. I'd like to report a tip. One moment please. Is something up today? What kind of a moron drives like this? I'm sorry. Ow, my neck, you guys okay? What the hell? Shit, stay where you are. Come here. You're so screwed. Look here, you shit face! Get over here! Stop! You bastard! Son of a bitch! Get him! Stop! Stop right there! I said stop! Mr. Jung, you're in good shape. Come at me, I'll kick your ass! That's enough! Mr. Jung, you got Nikes on? You sure run fast. Pil-do... You're a victim in this too. Did Jeon order a hit on me? You son of a bitch! You'll end up dead too! Mr. Kim, don't kill me, okay? In the end, we're on the same side, no? Oh jeez... You're a funny man. How are we on the same side? You're a salesman, and I'm a hooligan. Can't you let me go? You don't drink as well as I thought. - Hold still! - Don't be like that. Stop fidgeting, man. Don't move, asshole! You drank plenty. Mr. Jung. Drive safe. Send him off. $160M Bribery Scandal Over Busan New City Development Hello, this is Busan. I need a favor. Busan Daily, I have to shut them up. Some leverage would be good. Yes, get back to me. Go to the city hall. - You sure about this? - I'm 100% sure. - Where is he? - He's on the way. - Be ready. - All right! He's here! I gotta go! Busan City Hall Good day, sir. I saw the paper, I can't believe someone's been talking! You sure about this? Yes, why'd blow the lid on this? I know you're not someone who'd blow the whistle. But since all the pieces fit, I have to check. Sure. What happened to your face? I tripped while on a hike... Be careful, one misstep could be the end. Yes. Think carefully now. We're no pushovers. Of course not. What is it?! - You sons of bitches! - Piss off, punk. Goddamn prick! Ahn, go easy. What brings you here? I see it now... Now I see the whole picture. I'm thinking of doing a follow-up in 2 days. The new city case, right? Lee will do the follow-up. Why don't you take a vacation? What are you doing? Who is it this time? Whose money did you take? It's not like that. Then why? Just do what I say! Tell me why! We're told to stop. By whom? The one paying our salaries. Even if we got a bad reputation, this is crossing the line. If you sell yourself to everyone, how can we call ourselves reporters? I'm resigning. Man... I wanted to cook steaks, so I built a cowshed. Then I brought a calve, fed it and cleaned it too. But someone else lit the barbecue. So I came to see who it was, I didn't think you'd be here. I didn't intend to take what's yours. I know. Presidential election's coming up, the pressure is on, your only way was to use money. But numbers are a separate matter. Take Busan's 2 km² out, compensation site is 1 km², total compensation is $320M, market price went up by 2, but we'll go 50-50, take out the initial capital, which comes to $160M, plus bribes from the developers! Shouldn't I have some stake in it too? You're sounding more like a capitalist. How will you play politics like that? Remember what you said? To be in politics, either have a lifeline, or shit ton of money. I'm holding your lifeline. I also told you to ask for a favor to someone stronger than you. "To see who is stronger, see what they're holding." All right, let's hear it, what are you holding? Obviously, the new city plan, Democratic Party's suspicious illegal slush fund sources. When I sell these to the opposition before the election, they'll really have a field day, no? If you don't want it to come to that, it'd be wiser to bargain with me at a dirt cheap price. How much stake are you thinking of? 10%. As an independent fighter, I need at least that much. Oh my! You got ambition, good. Ambition? You took that away from me years ago, this isn't ambition, it's revenge. You're still quite naïve, going after revenge and all. You listen now. Revenge is one of two things: either beat him to death, or be on the same side. If you don't go all the way, I'll end up killing you. I won't wait long. I'll prep a large safe. Hae-woong. Clench your fist tightly. Or your lifeline will slip through. Don't you worry about me. Song! Hey, Song! Make your own damn coffee! I'm sick of you all... No, answer this call, someone's asking for you! This is Song Dana. A tip? Stop the car. So? What did he say? We went to a foxhole to catch a fox, but found a tiger. There's only one answer then. We have to catch the tiger. Pil-do. When a politician's bank gets fat, it means there's risk to his life. What is a risk-free life? One ankle sprain could lead to death. Right? You're correct. There's no turning back now, all right! Let's do this! Now you feel like a politician. Incarceration Record He's one of top Busan loan sharking gangsters. During the anti-gang initiative, all the big names got swooped up, and he took over the castle. What's wrong? It's nothing. He's working with Hae-woong recently. They've been working together since the election. Funds from Jung Han-mo, muscles from Kim Pil-do. Jung Han-mo? He worked as a developer but demolition and scraps too. He's practically a swindler. After the election, he had a fit about not getting his money back, it was a shit show. So? - He's dead. - How? He drunk drove off a cliff. So this bastard killed him. Put together a script. But it's... Are you on Hae-woong's payroll? Christ... Start anew, a scenario that benefits you too. I will, sir. Push through! Go! What the hell?! I don't know who you are, but that's enough. Mr. Kim Pil-do? So hot in here. You need to come with us. Where? It's a bad day for a trip. - You know Jung Han-mo? - Jung Han-mo? Mr. Jung? Yeah, I know him. Is he doing well? He's dead, and you're the prime suspect. May I make a call? To Jeon Hae-woong? He's indisposed at the moment. How crazy would I be to order a hit on him? Look, prosecutor, Jung was my main supporter. I'm asking because there's enough plausibility. Plausibility?! Really?! Why'd you threaten a citizen with just plausibility? Do I look that easy? And the investigation looks easy? You're a murder suspect! Me? Didn't he die after getting hammered? Alcohol was found in his lung during autopsy. Do you know what that means? Alcohol was poured into him! He drank like that, he poured alcohol into him. I've had it with you, goddamn hooligan! Fess up! Did Jeon order you?! Listen now, Mr. Prosecutor. Tables can turn at any moment in one's life. Think this carefully. And I'm a politician. If a gangster is dead, go catch a rival gangster, I really don't understand why you're hassling me. Even gangsters have a reason when they kill. It's money or a job. Then you got an answer! They fought over money, and one side flexed too hard! That's what gangsters do! How dare you... If you got nothing else, I'm gonna go. I have a lunch appointment. How is it going? Is this also your work, sir? If you want to live, turn the car around. Push comes to shove, I won't go down alone. No regrets, you hear? We've met before. What brings a man like you here? You must be tight with the prosecutors too. Very impressive. We operate in the shadows though. Loyalty is good. Beautiful, even. The important thing is, for whom you serve. Do you know what's moronic? Loyalty among morons. I brought quality stuff, so I ordered expensive dishes. It must be explosive then. Let's hear it. A tip? $160M Bribery Scandal Over Busan New City Development Could you repeat what you said in an answer form? - What is your name? - Park Sang-man. Occupation? Manager at Haeundae District Election Commission. What happened on the night of April 12? And I'm a politician. If a gangster is dead, go catch a rival gangster, I really don't understand why you're hassling me. I leaked film negatives for ballots, serial numbers and seals. Why? Even gangsters have a reason when they kill. It's money or a job. They fought over money, and one side flexed too hard! That's what gangsters do! - I made a deal. - A deal? He said he'll get my child a heart surgery. Ms. Song... My wife is not reachable... Do you feel it now? To whom you must be loyal? I heard you've made a mint. You need to go big to make big bucks. Think very carefully. Had he called early, I'd have prepped something. I'm so sorry for this. Eat slowly, there's plenty more. Okay, thank you. Ms. Song, you're so pretty. Thank you. Take good care of him. - He's a bit lacking... but he is no harm... - Head on in. This is not bad, but... we need a stinger. Then let's do our own thing. I'll be fine on my own. So... how about a show? Let's have a press conference. Gather all the reporters in town, line the cameras! Go big in one fell swoop! Let's reset this country. Hello? What's up at this hour? I didn't do much, no need to give me gifts. I found it! Motel Romeo - 1992-4-27 Prosecutors Ahn and Kim What are you getting at? You recognized it immediately? Do you see me? You'll go after the prosecutors now? My father said once, to work a cow, put a ring on its nose. You think this straight. If you fool around, how'll you handle the backlash? Does it look like I'm fooling around?! If you don't want that on TV, let Kim Pil-do go. Motel Romeo Of course you're innocent. I greased the officials, to be frank, they got nothing. They were bluffing. You just have to hold out. Got it? Here, here. You did good. - Hae-woong. - Yeah? Let's stop this. Stop what? Whatever it is, what you're doing now. Bud, we're almost there, we got the winning hand. Pil-do, you stick to muscles. I'll do all the thinking, got it? On a fishing boat on the night of April 12th, I handed ballot film negatives, serial numbers and seals to Kwon Soon-tae personally. One moment. We should emphasize that you were threatened. Attempted murder Illegal election tampering Political conspiracy Destruction of democracy Huh? The door's open. Ancestral rite? Good timing. Old man, let's bet again. I got an ace up my sleeve. Wait outside. Where's the chief prosecutor? At his office, where else? Probably drafting a warrant. Park Sang-man To lock you up. He's the Jesus. He has resurrected from the dead. Politics isn't like a gangster movie, this is way too dramatic. So much trouble to kill a pawn like me? It wasn't just for you, so don't feel too bad. No elections ever have the proper results, right? So what will you do? I feel so bad that I might expose everything. If you do? Will it change anything? Slush funds for a rigged election isn't exactly news. Ruling and opposition parties, prosecutors, the president, they are all in on it. Will anyone care? Is that so? Then why did you leave your family event to be here? I'll give you your 10%. You seriously underestimate me. That was before my ace. I'll make absolutely sure you get elected, wait, wait. There's a by-election in October. Our deal is one thing, isn't a mutual apology in order for our past mistakes? I'm sorry, accept my apology. - For what? - The election. Elections come around in time, am I right? But the dead won't. His wife is unreachable. If you must apologize, do it to Mr. Park first. Go on, apologize. Mr. Park. I am truly sorry. It's me. Prep for a delivery. Let's get going. - Did you have breakfast? - Yeah. - What's going on? - Press conference for what? Emergency Press Conference - let me know. - I will. Hello, hello. Is this happening? Start already! It's starting! Good morning. I'm Director of Planning, Moon Jang-ho. - Come out. - Come! What's going on? Please... What's going on… During the planning phase of Haeundae new city business, I was assaulted and threatened by violent gangs, and had to hand over confidential copy of the proposal, which included proposed sites, compensation plans, and Yellow Dragon Dev's Jung Han-mo died after a struggle with a rival gang. You died once, second time will be easier. Take care. - Let me use the phone. - Sure. Don't kill me, please! Please! Don't kill me! Answer please! I'd like to make a reservation. Which day? Is there a room? One moment. Any last words? Make it good. Pil-do, I told you, stick to muscles. Stupid last words. Begin! Beautiful weather. I will cooperate fully with prosecutor's investigation, and if I am responsible for this, I will accept any punishment. Are you willing to reveal your assaulter? Yes. It's Kim Pil-do. Mr. Park. I am truly sorry. Now, your turn. Apologize to Jung Han-mo in hell. Kim Pil-do spilled his guts. This is... called a draw, isn't it? Look here. This is... called win-win, am I right? Win-win? My boy, you're all grown up. I was going to kill you today... I guess it won't be necessary. Hae-woong, listen to my words. Politics is a deal with the devil. To gain power, you have to sell your soul. Okay. Dude. It's a dirty world. Yeah, the world is dirty, and life's a bitch. Take care. 9 months later Come, this is the gold badge. You're doing me the honor? I feel so privileged. Play politics properly, only for the people. Don't you worry. Now you look the part. - Hae-woong. - Yes? When you step inside, do not ever bow. It's the real jungle in there. Understood. Good evening! Thank you for coming a long way! Say hello. Rep. Jeon, welcome, a tough road here? No, not at all. - Greet others. - Of course. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Good to meet you. - Likewise, sir. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Rep. Jeon? - Yes? Nice to meet you. Over here. I'm sorry for making you come so far. Any chance to see Seoul is good by me. Please sit down. - Sit. - Yes, sir. Be at ease, we're all family now. Of course. By the way, the trouble starts now. We've been bluffing all over, what can we do about it? Must we do that too? They gotta clean up their own mess. You worry too much. Who even remembers those words? People are too busy to remember campaign promises. The Devil's Deal Cho Jin-woong Lee Sung-min Kim Moo-yul Directed by Lee Won-tae
