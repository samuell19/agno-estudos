I know you did something to Bob! Kelly... You can't fool me anymore! I see right through you! - Listen to yourself. Well, look at yourself. You haven't slept. How do you know what you're even thinking, let alone saying? - You killed him! - Oh, child. What happened to your husband was tragic... But I had nothing to do with it. He drank himself to death. You know that. I don't know how you did it but you did it, Helen. You made it look like a heart attack! That is absurd, sweetheart. I would never hurt anyone. You're gonna have a baby soon. I can give you a fresh start, away from the city and all the craziness. I bought that farmland I told you about. You're delusional. That place is in the middle of nowhere. Oh, if we're a family, we can be anywhere. Just stop it. I'm your mother. You're not my mother. You killed my husband! Don't touch me! You'll be back. You always come back to me... And dinner will be ready. This is Dr. Chalton returning your call. There's something you need to know about Helen. It's very important that you get in touch with me right away. Miss Henderson, Helen Henderson? Yes? I'm officer Lindsdale. May we come in? Certainly. This is my daughter's doing, isn't it? Miss Henderson, Iâ€™m sorry but I'm afraid that miss Jones is dead. What? No! That can't be true. She lost control of her car and suffered fatal injuries in the collision. Before she died in the ambulance, she gave us your name and address and she told us that... Stop saying those things! No! This is all a mistake! You need to calm down. We just need to ask you some questions about the death of her husband, Bob Jones. You are not going to destroy my family! No. I was going to be a grandmother. No. Follow-up notes for Helen Henderson. File number thirty-six, seven hundred and seventy-seven. Dr. Daniel chalton observed that, even before the incident, his patient was delusional, prone to codependency and obsession with others. She was accused of murder, but no evidence was found. After the investigation, miss Henderson's assault case was handed off to the Philadelphia medical board and she was committed for nine months. She became a model patient. She was released one month ago, and this will be my first mandatory visit. I will observe miss Henderson and make my evaluation. Logging off, January twelfth, three-oh-one P.M. What a lovely country home. I put a mortgage on that place last year, just before my troubles, and... I almost have it paid off free and clear. Really? The peace and quiet, and it has a beautiful home that I have been redoing. Well, of course, money is no object and... Who knows how many years this old body has left? Well, you're not exactly over the hill. You're extremely healthy and, uh, very strong for your age. Oh, well, thank you. Um, um, coffee, tea? Uh, no thank you. I, I don't do caffeine. Ah. You seem wary, grace. Is, uh, something about me troubling you? Maybe something that reminds you of your mother? I don't think it's appropriate to talk about my family in this interview, Helen. I saw you doing the same thing with Dr. Chalton in the videos. You seem to be quite the expert in... How shall I say it? Changing the perspective. I am not an expert in anything. I'm just an ordinary woman trying to start my life over. Grace... I am not proud of what I did. Attacking a police officer? I can hardly believe that it was me. But I'm not one to make excuses. I just wanna make it right. Well, that's a very healthy attitude to have. Beautiful new day out there and life is worth living and there are so many things that I wanna do. Mm-hm. I think a support group with people your own age would be very good for you. Uh, in the meantime... Please, take my card. That's my cellphone number. You can give me a call anytime. Thank you. Well, now, you drive carefully, and I'll see you soon. Bye. Can I help you with that? Why do you always have to be so damn charming? Afternoon, neighbor. Oh, hi there, uh, neighbor? You live across the road? Guilty as charged. I'm Sarah and this is Kyle. Hi. Hi. I'm Helen. Oh, it's wonderful to meet you. Um, I saw the moving trucks here yesterday, but I didn't realize the place had been sold. Oh, we closed a couple of weeks ago. Kind of a... Reboot-our-lives situation. Yeah, 'cause sometimes it just makes sense to move out into the suburbs in the dead of winter. Oh, well, if you have a family, you can be anywhere! Um, what do you do for a living, Kyle? Well, I've been in business for myself about five years, uh, video game software. Oh, a young entrepreneur. That's exciting! Um, do you have kids? Um, well... Well, we're trying. Oh... Excuse me one second, guys. Hi, mom. We just got here. I thought I'd let you know... That my cruise is booked in a week, so I can still help you get settled in. I'll be there in a few days. Ah, uh, mom, I, I think we can handle a few boxes ourselves. Philadelphia's right on my way to port. It's not a problem at all. I insist on helping! You need someone with real experience to feng shui that place. Mom, look, I love you, ok? But this whole starting-over thing has been tough on Sarah, and I'm gonna be out of town tomorrow. I have to go. I'll call you later. Love you too, honey. Hey. Helen just said she'd make dinner for us some night. Isn't that sweet of her? Oh, yeah. Yeah. What's wrong, Kyle? Um, it's, uh, with mom. She, uh... Uh, Helen, can you give us a minute? Oh, yes. I understand. Yeah. Thank you. Family business. Now, if there's anything you need, anything, I am just next door. So I guess you couldn't talk Judith out of coming, huh? I'm sorry, hon. But she-mom means well. - Hm. She'll just be here for a few days. That'll be fun. Please, promise me you'll try to play nice. What's that? Is there something outside? I think it's just a raccoon or something. Hey, we're in suburbia, remember? It's, uh, welcome to the jungle, right? Ah, look. A new family. A new beginning! You look awesome. Maybe I should postpone the meeting. I mean, my flight back is gonna be real late and I wanna be here to help you with the move-in. It's not fair that... Look, don't worry. Jennifer said she was coming by later. You've been working on this pitch for weeks and you've gotta do it. You're gonna blow these New York bigshots away, ok? I love you more every day. Go get 'em, tiger. Yeah. Bye, beautiful. Bye. Hm. Hello, trouble. Well, that's a fine way to say hello to a lady. Oh, you're surprised? I mean, last time we were together, you were so drunk you could barely stand up. It was a party, and I was networking. Anyways, Kyle, I need a gig, and you still owe me one. You are my ex-girlfriend. You're not a software engineer. Must I remind you that you wouldn't be married if it wasn't for me? And I appreciate it. I really do. But this is a serious time right now. We're about to land a major investment and I don't need the drama. So now I'm a drama queen? Are you kidding me? I was there for you so you better be there for me! I was there for you and you gambled away every penny! Oh, Kyle, come on! You've been to Vegas again, haven't you? That's why you're asking for money, right? It always is. I can help you. Just give me a PR gig or something. We don't need that, and I won't pay your debts, Angela. I'm sorry. I have to go now. Don't you dare hang up on me! Kyle! Hi there, Helen. Hey there! I brought some breakfast for you kids, just before the day gets crazy. Oh, wow! My daughter always liked blueberry muffins. Well, Kyle actually just left on a business trip this morning, so it's just me. But please, come in, Helen. You're so thoughtful. Here, let me help you with this. Oh, thank you. What a beautiful spread. Does your daughter live far away? Hm. We had two daughters, actually. They're not with us anymore. My husband also passed on, oh, many years ago. I, I've lost everyone. God, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up. No worry. We should talk about these things. Is your mom still around? I never had a mom... Or a dad. I was raised in a group home. Me and my best friend Jennifer, we were never adopted. Oh, so tragic. No, it, it wasn't that bad. Jen was like a sister to me. And I, I walked out of there when I was seventeen, got into graphic art and started working as a freelancer. And you're between jobs now? That's actually how I met Kyle. He had just started his new company and they needed a logo, and his ex was doing some promo work for them and introduced us. I wasn't looking to hook up with anyone. But there he was, you know, this brilliant guy going into business for himself and... Yeah. Did, uh, something happen? You're pretty perceptive, Helen. We were three years deep, trying to have a baby. Nothing was working. We were both pretty fed up, but he made a mistake that he regretted. An affair. Oh, honey. He's a good man. He's kind and he cares about people. I still see who he really is. We're just working on trust again. Grace Henry logging in, January thirteenth. Follow-up with Helen Henderson. Bringing her the literature for the state hospital codependency group. I can't believe that I just said all that to you. Well, there's one thing I've learned. You find family in those around you. And it's important to know when to hang on and when to let go. Thank you for saying that. I'm really glad that we met. Oh, I am too. Helen? Helen, are you home? Helen, are you ok? Helen? Hello? You tell the funniest jokes. Oh, my, oh. Oh, um, um, you'll have to excuse me, honey. I have to get going. Uh, there is something I forgot to do over at the house. Yeah, of course. - Yeah. Yeah. I'll see you out. - Ok. Great. Here. After you. Thank you. Thanks so much for ok. Everything, Helen. I'm coming up. Helen? Helen, I'm coming in. What are you doing here, grace? Helen, I need you to explain this to me. These are my children. You know that's not true. That Kelly Jones girl; She's not your daughter. You just imagined she was. And who is she? Mm. Your real daughter, Layla Henderson, this is her. She committed suicide years ago. The other girl, Kelly Jones, she was someone you met on the Internet, and you fixated on. You only ever had one daughter and you've been trying to replace her ever since she died. Helen. Helen, I wanna help you, ok? We all wanna help you. You have a condition. But it's ok. I, Iâ€™m gonna call Dr. Chalton and we can go see him together. Ok? But you can't keep living your life this way. Dear grace... You're giving me no choice. Oh. You made me do it. You were gonna spoil everything. Oh, no. I, I didn't mean to hurt anyone. Please forgive me. I'm gonna be right back. Shhh! Be quiet. Helen, you left your phone on my table. Helen? Uh, I'm coming! Uh, well, hello. I guess you forgot something. Oh, thank you. I can be so absent minded sometimes. I don't mean to interrupt anything. I see that you have company. Oh, yeah, grace is inside. Oh, thank you for your concern. I'm, I'm ok. Um, I'll, I'll see you real soon. Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Oh! Hey there. Now, slowly. Take it easy. Oh. You fainted. You've been unconscious for a few minutes. It's so strange. I just-i felt so nauseous all of a sudden. Well, you did mention that you were trying to have a baby, so maybe... hm? Oh, you mean like morning sickness? No. I, I need to get back over to my house. Oh? I-I'm so sorry. Helen, i-I've been such a nuisance. Oh, no, not at all. Oh, and I'm sorry you didn't get to meet my friend grace. She had to leave. Now are you ok getting home by yourself? Yeah. Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll see you soon, ok? Yes. I will be here... When you need me. Mm. And you will need me, I promise. Grace, what am I gonna do about your car? Hey! Hey, Jen. Are you still coming over later? Pizza's on me. I might be a little later than I thought, though. These lesson plans from today are kicking my ass. You'll be ok until I get there? Yeah, I hope so. What's wrong? It's probably nothing, but I also hope it's something. I'll tell you later, in person, ok? Ok. See you soon. Bye. Sara? Oh! Hi, Helen. I, I guess we're both out shopping, huh? I see you took my advice. Yeah. Yeah. It's better safe than sorry, right? All of a sudden, I feel so nervous. I just-i hate being alone at times like this. Oh, and your husband is in New York tonight, right? He's taking the late flight home and Jen's coming over, but not till later. Well, I wouldn't mind to stay with you for a while, just so that you're not by yourself. You know something? I think I'd like that. Oh. Ok. This is grace Henry with Philadelphia mental health services. Please leave a message. Dammit, grace. Where are you? You've been Mia all day. Just... just give me a call back, please. This is Helen Henderson. Please leave your message at the tone. Miss Henderson, this is David Mellard with Philadelphia mental health services. Please give me a call back. My colleague, grace Henry, has gone missing and I'd like to ask you a question or two about it. I just-i can't look at it. I-I just can't. Sarah! In adverse situations, you must dive in and swim. Let me have it. So? What does it say? Congratulations. Oh, my god! Oh, my god. Helen, thank you! Oh, I am so... Thank you so much! I'm having a baby! Hey! Oh, my god! Jen! What's wrong? Are you ok? This is Helen. She's my next door neighbor. She's been really awesome ever since we got here. Hi. Hello. So, what's up then? Why are you crying? I'm so happy. You know what I think? I think we should have a great party! You wanna do it? This is amazing! I can't believe this. Thanks for coming by to see us, Kyle. Oh. Thank you for the opportunity. Sorry the presentation ran long but, uh, I hope you'll agree that it was, uh, comprehensive. Absolutely, Kyle. And, uh, I think we'll be doing some business. I'll have my lawyers go over the particulars and we'll catch up with you in Philly in a couple of days, ok? And dinner's on me. Thank you, Mr. Becker. Please, call me John. Oh, and, uh, be sure to bring Sarah with you. I'm sure my wife would love to see her again. Yeah, yeah. Sure thing, John. Thank you, gentlemen. Um... How do you think you're gonna tell him? I'm, Iâ€™m, I'm sorry, ladies... I, uh, that I have to break up the party, but there are a few things that I have to do at home before my bedtime. Ok. Um, I am so excited for you. Now, oh, don't forget to make that doctor's appointment tomorrow. Yeah. And I can drive you. You're so kind, Helen. - Aw. I, I'm gonna take you up on that. Thank you. Bye, Helen. Nice to meet you. Oh, nice to meet you too. I'm sure I'll see you soon. Oh, yes. Nighty-night. Bye, Helen. Bye-bye. She seems kinda lonely. She's amazing. We have, like this bond already. It's a bit weird, I guess, but I trust her. That's something I never thought I'd hear you say. I know. It's like a little crazy, right? Well, we always wanted a mom when we were kids. Maybe your dream house came ready-made with one. Mm. Sorry, grace. Mm. Hi, miss Henderson. This is David Mellard with Philadelphia mental health services. Please give me a call back. My colleague, grace Henry, has gone missing and I'd like to ask you a question or two about it. My number's 555-1212. This is amazing! And the timing couldn't be better... Because the business is about to really take off. We might even be able to pay off the mortgage early. Hey! Aren't you happy? Yes. Of course, I'm happy. I'm just also kind of scared to death. So am I. But a year from now, we're gonna wonder why we ever worried. So long as she's a girl. So long as she's a girl. Hey there. Hi, Helen. Thought I'd come over and help you unpack. Uh... Oh, did you make that doctor's appointment? Yes. It's just that... Well, let the lady in. Come in, Helen. I'm Kyle's mother, Judith. Just flew in from Chicago. Mmm! And you must be the famous next-door Helen. Ah. Please. Come in. Thank you. Have a seat. Excuse the mess. Hm. All these empty boxes to throw out. But that's why I'm here. Would you like coffee, Helen? Black, please. Of course. I'll get some. Thank you, Sarah. You're welcome. Oh, that's a beautiful ring. Hm. I guess Iâ€™m sentimental. Reminds me of my late husband. Hm. Judith sort of surprised us early this morning. We weren't expecting her until later in the week. Sarah's just being dramatic. I absolutely told Kyle I'd be here in a few days. And then my son tells me Iâ€™m going to be a grandmother! You can't imagine the excitement, Helen! Oh, yes, I can imagine. Anyway, we have a busy day ahead of us, Sarah. I have a whole list of things we need to get for you. And we have to make it to that doctor's appointment on time. Uh, I could help with that. Oh, don't pay it another thought. Sarah tells me you've been very supportive, but I think I can take it from here. You understand, right? Oh, of course. Um, I suppose I should get going. No, Helen. Please stay. Just finish your coffee. No. She's right, honey. We have to get a jump on the day. So nice of you to drop by, Helen. Well, I'll see you soon, Sarah. I'd like that, Helen. We can all have dinner. Hm. Thanks for stopping by. Oh, yes. Oh, and you are very welcome and I hope to see you soon. Poor woman. You have to watch out for ladies like that, Sarah. They're lonesome and they try to take over. Believe me, I know. I think she's great. Let's finish getting ready. We have shopping to do. Then I'll help you finish the house. So much to plan. You're all paid for now. Mmm. That's that. Mmmm. Mmmm. Nice place, Kyle. Well, hello there. Hello, yourself. Aren't you pretty. Are you here looking for Kyle? Who are you, neighborhood watch? Oh, it's not polite to answer a question with a question. I'm Helen. Nice to meet you. Angela. Hm. Charmed. Angela, would you care for a beverage? So... you were Kyle's, um, lady friend... Before he met Sarah? Something like that. - Oh. I introduced them, actually. Kyle's a great one for gratitude. Ah. So, what was your plan for today? Intimidation? Or are you just a woman scorned? I'm not sleeping with him, if that's what you mean. Oh, but you wouldn't mind his wife thinking that, would you, for financial leverage? I can see just by looking at you that you're a devious little thing. I have to be! Do you know what it's like for a woman in PR, Helen? Everyone's looking to screw you over, or just screw you. Oh, how tragic. What's your particular game, Helen? What's so interesting about Kyle and Sarah Collins? Let me put it to you this way, love. My husband passed away years ago and left me very rich. Now, it's true that money can't buy you everything, but I have a feeling that it will help me purchase an ally in you. You're going to need a crib and we'll need to repaint the guestroom too. Oh! Gentle colors are essential for your new baby's comfort zone. It's still a little soon for all that, isn't it? Nonsense! Fortune favors the prepared, darling. Look, let's just slow down a minute, ok? Would you like to know what happened to my husband when he slowed down, honey? He died. I don't think we need to be so melodramatic, Judith. I'm here to help you! And I appreciate that. But just let me catch my breath, ok? I feel like I haven't gotten a word in all day. Ok, fine! What would you like to say to me? Oh, never mind. Well, I'm listening. I couldn't save her. I couldn't save my baby. I needed you, mommy! Where were you? I'm right here, honey. I won't fail you again. I promise. Which one of us are you talking to, old woman? No. Go away. You've ruined everything. You've destroyed our family! No! We're going to punish you. Oh, no. No! No! Go away! Go away! No! Ah. Mm. Oh, hello there! Hi, Helen. You're up with the sun, I see. Ha ha. I always am. So look, um, I just wanted to apologize about Judith. Oh. She's a real force of nature and I'm so sorry that you had to deal with that. Oh, it's absolutely fine. She means well. It's kinda funny. I used to wish for a mom, but now that I have one, she's kind of Oh. Family takes work. Mm hm. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but... You remind me of my second daughter, Kelly. She was beautiful and self-reliant and she was gonna have a baby, like you. Oh, Helen. I'm sorry. I, I know that this must be so hard for you sometimes. Mm hm. Would you like to come in? There's something I'd like to show you. Yeah. I'd like that. Oh. It's beautiful. It was my dream to move there... To provide my grandchildren with a, an unspoiled upbringing, free of the city, free from everything bad. I'm going in a few days and I might or might not sell this old house but it's time to go. You're leaving? Uh, you can come and visit. Oh, I'd love to have you and your daughter there. I always wanted a little girl. Oh. How did you know that? You wear it on your face, hon. You wanna be the mother you never had. Oh. Oh. Thank you, Helen. Mm. Thank you for understanding me. We all need understanding, child. All of us. Decorating the baby's room is going to be so much fun! You know, I may have to postpone my cruise. There's just so much to be done. Anyway... You should start getting ready soon, honey. You want to look your best for that big meeting tonight. Of course, Judith. Mm-hm. Well, well, well. Now be sure not to drink any alcohol at dinner. And call if you're going to be late. Don't worry, Judith. I will. Well, stop a minute. Let me look at you. What? Is there like a hair off or something? You just look so beautiful. I'm proud of you. I always have been, Sarah. I know I can be, well, kind of a bit much sometimes. Thank you, Judith. Oh, my rideshare is here. I gotta go. Bye, mom. Bye. Oh. Make sure the crib is delivered to the address that I gave you this week. I want my daughter to be surprised. She's gonna be so happy. Look, I already told you I haven't seen grace for days. Can't you just put a detective on the case or something? Fine. You know where to reach me. May I help you? Yeah. I was just across the road to see Helen Henderson, but she's not answering the door when I knock, and she hasn't really picked up her phone. Are you a friend of miss Henderson's? No. What's this all about? Um, one of my colleagues has gone missing and your neighbor may have been the last person to have seen her. The police haven't really been helpful either. Um, grace, uh, was, well, she was miss Henderson's court-appointed social worker. Social worker? Tsk. I knew that woman was trouble. She's crazy, isn't she? I'm not really at Liberty to discuss that kind of information. Uh... Probably already said too much. But I do need to speak with miss Henderson so, uh, would you take my card and, uh, pass it along to her if you see her? Well... Of course. Thank you. When I first looked at this deal, I was impressed. But looking even deeper, I have to say that we were blown away, Kyle. You've got your finger right on the pulse so... Thank you. Mm, we think so. Well, I know so. So congratulations. It's a done deal. Oh, my gosh! Thank you. Thank you. And if it's not too short notice, I'd like to get you on a jet to London tomorrow morning. Meet our development people there. Just a getting-to- know-you thing. I'll send a car and we'll have you back here in a couple of days. Cool? You, you will not be sorry. I know I won't. I understand that the two of you met on the job, Sarah. Yes. Yes. It was, uh, actually kind of a funny story. I was doing some, uh, design work for him and, well, you know how these things go. We just, we kind of hit it off. Excuse me one second. Um, I think he was a little bit scared of me, To be quite honest. What the hell is this? How'd you know I was here? Oh, come on. You know I have my ways. Let's not be children. Get the hell off of me! You're insane! You know something, baby? You do indignant so well. Talk soon. Hello. Nice house. Nice home. Simple, but nice. Please, come in. Uh, can I do something for you? Yes. I wanted to have a little talk. I spoke with a gentleman in the employ of the state a little while ago. He had some not-so-flattering information about you. Ah. And what was that? He said you had a court-appointed social worker! Now I took that to mean you were either in prison or in a nuthouse. So I checked, and I was right! Sarah is so smitten with you. She can't even see how crazy you are. And so I am issuing a warning. If you don't leave my family in peace... I'll expose you, Helen. I'll dig even deeper and find out all the dirt! And I'll prove it to her and she will never speak to you again! Are we clear, Helen? Yes. I'm so sorry... I think things went really great tonight. Yeah. Yeah. What's wrong? Aren't you happy? Yeah. You know, I'm just, uh... Nervous, you know. Just gotta pack and get on that plane in the morning. Well, I think it's exciting. Yeah. Mom? Shh. She's probably asleep. She's a night owl. It's... It's only ten. Mom! What the hell? That should do it. Kyle? What's wrong? Where's... Judith? She made one of her famous getaways. I'm not sure if I should be worried or relieved. Oh, she'll be fine. But I promise she won't be trying to run our lives anymore. I'm gonna sit down and have the talk with her. Well, you might not need to. She was really sweet with me earlier tonight. Maybe everything will work itself out. Yeah. Maybe. I'm sorry, Judith. You made me do it. I promise that I will take care of our girl. She'll be safe and loved... Forever. Ahh. These are perfect. Thanks, Harold. Told you. I'm an artist. Did you bring the cash? Of course. I can see you've become accustomed to a certain style of living. That explains a great many things. Save the corny judgement. I want what we agreed upon times two. You've got a lot of nerve, child. I have expenses! This is non-negotiable, Helen. Um-hm. I want what I came for. You are true to your word. This is damning stuff. Uh! My money! Or what? You're gonna tell Sarah that we entered into a devil's bargain? Oh, that won't end well for either one of us. I got into this for the money. I don't trust you! So think of the extra cash as insurance. I am not a woman who likes threats. You remind me of my mother. Hm. I hated my mother! You've been a bad, bad girl, Angela. Here is the money we agreed upon. Now, I trust that completes our contract and that you never darken my door again. Yes. What was that? I said yes. Good. Have a good flight. Call me when you get there. I will. I love you. Ok. Um... I love you. I love you too. So he's a little scared. So what? I mean, it's natural for a guy who's making the deal of his life, right? I don't know. There was something off. He was so... Reflective, I guess. Anyway, I'm stuck here all alone for the next two days. You wanna have a movie night or something? I won't be out from under these papers until at least Friday. You should call Helen. No, she's been gone. She's probably getting ready for her trip. She's moving away soon. Oh. That's sad. You guys were really getting along. Yeah. But she said she had a country place and that I can come visit. Maybe you could come visit too. Hey. I gotta go but we'll talk this weekend, ok? Take care of yourself. You're worrying for two now, remember? I remember. Bye. Hey, this is Kyle Collins with tech com industries. Leave your digits and I'll get back to you. You're the luckiest man in the world. Yeah! We're, we're looking at a great future together! Tell me another one, you pathetic liar! Oh, child. Oh... Helen, I... I feel so stupid. What? And this was just last night? He was making out with her while I was playing pretty wife for his new boss. Despicable. Helen, I feel so sick. You are a wonderful woman and you're going to be a wonderful mother! Kyle does not deserve either of you, never did! Honey, look at me. Look at me. I can't tell you how many times I've had to start over, but I always knew where it was leading. I knew when to move on and Bury the past. That's fine for you, Helen, but what about our child? That binds me with Kyle forever. How can I ever look him in the eye again? I saw your suitcases. Where were you planning on going? I don't know, any place but here. Maybe just get in the car and drive. It's ironic. I was coming over to say good-bye. I am planning on going to my place in the country this afternoon. Why don't you come with me? Stay for a few days, hm? You don't mind if I come with you? Oh, nothing would make me happier. Thank you, Helen. Oh, no. You're so kind. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you, my dear. Mmm. Mm. Dear Kyle... As I write this to you, my heart is filled with sadness. I don't understand how you could do these things to me and to our family. In the past, I've given you the benefit of the doubt and forgiven your mistakes, but now you've left me no choice but to consider living apart. I'm going away for a while. I need time alone. I need to think about our future, and you need to think too... About what you've done. Good-bye. I should probably call Jennifer soon. She'll wonder where I've been. Whatever you think is best. I just, I don't even know what to say to her. This is all so embarrassing. I just, I feel exhausted. Here. Here, have a drink. You're dehydrated. Thanks. Hey, big guy. What's up? Hey. I just got to my hotel and checked my phone and Sarah left me a really pissed-off message. I never heard her like that before and I'm really worried. What'd she say? She just cursed me out and hung up. I've been trying to get her on the phone and she won't answer. The next flight isn't until morning but I'm really thinking about getting on it. Don't panic. I'm on it, Kyle. I'll get her and see what's up. We'll figure this out. Ok. Hey, guys. I'm not around, so leave that all-important message. Hey. So what the hell's going on? Kyle's about to drop everything and run back here. If you don't call me back right now, I'm coming over there. Fair warning. It won't hurt the baby, darling. You'll just sleep for a while. Hey, guys. I'm not around, so leave that all-important message. It went straight to voicemail this time, hon. Which means you turned off your phone since I called last. I am now officially worried. Sarah? Sarah, come on! Open up! Sarah? Hello? Hey, this is Kyle Collins. Leave your digits and I'll get back to you. Hey, Kyle. Getting your ass back here is a good idea. You're gonna have a lot of explaining to do. We're here, Sarah. The start of our new life. I'm gonna help you inside. Helen? Sweetheart? I'm up here. Hello. Hi. You were so tired when we arrived that you slept through the night. Helen, I was thinking that maybe I should probably try to call Jennifer. Do you know where my phone is? Oh, right here. Thanks. Um, I'm afraid we don't have reception in these mountains and, uh, I don't have my landline yet. But you'll talk to Jennifer soon. And you did leave a note for Kyle so that should explain everything to both of them. Cream and sugar? Yes, please. I just really think that I should call... Isn't this place beautiful? I spared no expense. I wanted it to be perfect. I wanted this moment to be just right. Oh, please! Have something to eat. Blueberry muffins are your favorite, remember? Right. Yeah. I'm sorry that Iâ€™m being so weird, Helen. You've been really kind letting me come here and it is a gorgeous place. When you're a bit more awake, I will show you around. And you can spend the day relaxing and then tomorrow we'll go into town so you can call Jennifer. That sounds great. I'll be in on Monday, first thing. Tell Shelly I'll sub for her to make it up. Thanks for understanding. Helen Henderson. I never get over how, how beautiful this is. It's so isolated. Oh, I own all the land as far as the eye can see. Ha. My closest neighbor is twenty miles away from here. I can't stop thinking about Kyle. I had a counselor in school who once told me that the only way out of your problems is through them, and I just feel like I'm doing the exact opposite, you know, running away and hiding? Well, there's no shame in that. It's the first stage in starting over. Isn't it nice? I bought it just for you. Helen, this is just... This is way, way, way, way too much. Oh, I wish I had locked the door so that I could show this to you in my own way. And those speakers on the wall, they're baby monitors, aren't they? Mm-hm. You needed a place to raise your daughter, unspoiled, untouched by corruption, and I have made it happen for you. Wait. You, you want me to stay here? Don't you want to? Helen. No, you, you can't be serious. No, this, this is all... This is too much. Child, I'm the mother you never had and you're going to have the daughter you always wanted. We found each other. We're going to be a family. Now, I'm going to give you a few moments... And then we will open some presents. Hm? Have a nice flight? What's going on? Why are you looking at me like that? This is insanity! This is all a setup! This is not at all what really happened! Angela trapped me! Oh, give me a break, Kyle! Do you really expect either of us to believe that? Jennifer, I screwed up so bad with Sarah before, but that is not who I am now! She made me wanna be a better person. She made me wanna be worthy of her and I worked so hard to earn that again! Oh, my god. I've gotta believe she's gonna see the truth. Jennifer, please, please. You, you have to help me. What am I supposed to do? Her phone isn't even on. This situation seems way past words. You crazy woman. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry. It was just business. You set me up! And now my wife is gone! I needed the money. I'm getting out of town but there's something I need to tell you before I go. What? I can't say exactly but Helen Henderson, just watch out for her. She's dangerous. I don't want you or Sarah to get hurt. She's capable of anything. Where is Helen now? I have no idea! Just stay away from her. I'm gone. Angela! Angela! Dammit! Kyle, I think we should call this guy. Sarah? I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, but the sooner you come to terms with it, the better things will be. And I haven't done any of this out of malicious intent. Oh... I love you, Sarah. Helen, I need you to tell me the truth! Did you have anything to do with those pictures of Angela and my husband? Helen... I've spent my whole life looking for people to trust and I've been hurt a lot, so please just tell me the truth! Calm down. He wasn't good for you. He never was. Men like that never change! And I won't let that man break your heart again. Helen Henderson wasn't a textbook case. She was uniquely afflicted, hot and cold, tortured by her own actions, also very intelligent. I thought she might be a problem for my colleague, grace Henry, and, um, now grace is, uh, gone. Do you think Helen had something to do with miss Henry's disappearance? I'm not sure, but police are looking into it now, so hopefully they find something. Do you know where Helen might have gone? Well, um, she would talk to her doctors a lot about buying property, um, near the Allegheny forest, near Bradford, about a six-hour drive. Um, but there's just so much woods. Um, unless you knew exactly what you were looking for, you could get lost forever. I got it. Thanks for your time. Wait, Kyle. We need to think this through. If Helen had something to do with grace Henry's disappearance... Then she's dangerous, just like Angela said, and Sarah's with her. I have an idea! We can do a real estate search on deals in the area. Maybe we can find an exact address. I have to get on the road, ok? You do that here and you call me. Kyle, I know you feel responsible but be careful. I'm just getting a really bad feeling about this. Listen, we will find her, ok? I know we will, and Iâ€™m gonna keep her safe. All right? You haven't eaten a thing. Is everything ok? Helen, please. Nobody deserves to be a victim, nobody. My dear Sarah, it made me so sad to do what I did, when I saw how heartbroken you were, but I had to show you. You had to learn. And now I've shown you the truth about Kyle. No, Kyle was never a monster. He deserved a second chance, and I gave it to him. I wanted it for us, Helen. I still do. He betrayed you! And I forgave him for it! That's what makes us better than monsters, Helen, forgiving, moving on, not turning our backs when we realize the people we love are only human! Oh, listen to yourself. You sound like an abused wife rationalizing. I love him, Helen! Please, just, just take me home. I, I won't tell anybody about you or this place. I'll even, I'll come back and see you, ok? We can work through all this together but first you have to let me go. My child, I will never let you go. Now I hope you like molten-chocolate cake. I make it better than anyone else. Come on, come on, come on, come on! You won't be leaving that way, Sarah. I made sure of it. You really didn't think me that foolish, did you? You can't keep me here, Helen. No, I, I, I won't stay here! Yes, you will. And one day you'll thank me, and you'll be happy here. Now, come on in. You'll catch your death. And it's almost bedtime. You need your rest. I'm gonna have to lock your door tonight. And don't even think to try the windows. They're barred. I've planned for everything. Are you gonna shoot me if I misbehave? I wouldn't hurt the baby, but I promise, I'll do whatever it takes to keep you both safe. Come. Come on. So you came up with nothing? Well, not exactly. I found a lot of real-estate purchases in the area. But there's so many, it would take weeks to go through them all. Ok. Maybe I could just go asking around Bradford 'cause somebody's gotta know where the lady lives, right? It's unlikely. According to Sarah, Helen just moved into the area. You know... I think I'm gonna go across the street, Kyle, see if I can look into Helen's house. She might have left something behind that can help. Ok. Uh, I'll just sit tight then. I'm about fifty miles from Bradford. Gotcha. G-h? Grace Henry. Oh, my god! Hey! Hey! What's up? What's going on? I'm going crazy! Kyle, listen to me very carefully. You have to get to Sarah fast. I'm gonna text you the address. She's about twenty minutes away from where you are now. Oh, my god, Kyle. Ok. Just, just, just slow down, ok? Just, just get a grip! What's going on? I found something in Helen's backyard. I think there's a body buried back there. This can't be happening. This can't be happening. Hello? Who's there? I saw your headlights. Come out where I can see you! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh god! Oh my god! Sarah? Kyle! I can't open the door! It's locked on this side. Oh, my god, are you and the baby ok? Kyle! Helen is crazy! Ok, yeah. All right. Let's get you out of here. Stop right there! You step aside from her. It's all over, lady! The cops know what you did! I'm warning you. They'll be here any second! I said step away from her, Kyle! Just give me the gun, ok? Everything will be ok. I promise! You are talking to me just like all those others. They treat me like I'm crazy! But is it crazy to want a family? Is it crazy to want to protect my own daughter? I'm not your daughter! Yes, you are. Yes, you are! You don't even know what you're saying! Helen, please! Don't shoot me. Oh, my god. What am I doing? No! Everything's ruined. Oh, no. I Don' want to go back to that place... I didn't deserve this. I worked so hard for my family So how's my little girl doing? Cranky, like her mom. I love you both so much. Mmm. Mmm. Aw! You wanna get something to eat? Should we get her something to eat? Yeah, let's do that. Come on, Judith, let's see what's in the fridge. Let's see! Aw, then it's time for a nap, huh? What have we got in here? Yeah. Ok, what have we got... Captions by Sas Harris
