Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment Man: I can't remember if I had my first drink to celebrate my good fortune or to grieve my losses. I figure if I sit here long enough, I'll remember. How can a guy who has nothing lose everything? Well, I found out. My name's Fritz brown, and this is my story. It all started about a month and a half ago. I had been working as a repo man for bud Myers, biggest used-car dealer in southern California. The whole day just started out all wrong. I mean, wrong as in bad, you know? [Laughs] Oh, shit. Whoo! Man: Hey, motherfucker! Ho ho ho. No, man, no. Anybody moves my car-- You want a dependable deal? You get on down to bud Myers. Say hello, barko. Come on, barko, bark for daddy. Fritz: I met bud Myers back when I was still a cop. And when I drank my way off the force, bud was right there with the repo gig. It saved my ass. Hey, Fritz, how's that look? Oh, it looked great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. What a fucking work of art! We ought to hire that fucker to redo all our waiting rooms. [Laughs] You like it, huh? "Dragon wagon." You want a drink, Fritz? Yeah, give me a regular coke. Oh, that's right, I forgot. You're not drinking this week. Bud, you are something else. After all the money that dog's made for you, and you're still feeding him that dried shit? You are one cheap fuck. He likes it. It's good for his teeth. What teeth? He's got no teeth. Then I must be a cheap fuck. You said it, not me. [Laughs] Hey, some son of a bitch burned solly k's down to the ground last night. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Too bad. One of your hangouts, right? Sure, it's a great place to take...Your wife. What are you talking about? I thought she divorced your ass. What do I owe ya? Fritz: I never did more than one repo a day. Bud paid me so well, I didn't have to. So to keep from going insane, I opened the brown's detective agency. I had a little office out in rancho park where I spent my days waiting for a knock on the door and, unfortunately, on this particular day, came. I worked 6 years as a cop in Hollywood, where you get all the crazies. And let me tell you, nothing that I'd seen or did could have prepared me for what was about to happen. I'd thought a little p.I. Work would keep my mind off drinking. Well, that was my first mistake. [Knock on door] Just a minute. [Knock on door] Hey, hey, just a minute. Can I help you? Probably, if you're p.I. Fritz brown. I am. Uh, so what happened to you? You lose a golf ball or something? A gol--[Laughs] No, there's never been a golf ball that I couldn't find. Ha ha. Can I come in? Ha ha ha ha. I'm Freddie baker. You got the same initials as me. You can call me fat dog, though. Don't worry. That's not an insult. Everyone calls me that. I like it. All right, uh, fat dog, my fee is 500 bucks a day, plus any and all expenses, and I get paid up front in full. Can you handle it? I may not look like no millionaire, but I'm holding heavy, trust me. I'll whip some bread out on you as soon as I tell you what it is I want. All right. Shoot. Um... All right, I got this, uh, sister, my--my kid sister Jane. And, um... She's the only family I got. And, uh, for a long time now, she's been living with this rich old Jewish guy, right? And he don't want her to have nothing to do with me. Yeah. Right? And he pays for her piano lessons. And now Janie, my own kid sister, shines me on like I'm a piece of shit. That sucks. Your sister, is she over 18? Well, she's 17, but I wasn't looking for no morals rap. It's just, you know, this guy's been fucking around somehow, and I want to get to the bottom of it. So you tail the Jew around town, see what he's into-- oh, and I need-- I need pictures. You got a camera, right? If necessary, I have an undercover photographer that I work with, yeah. Undercover. That's good. Do you mind? So are you going to help the fat dog or what? Well, I'll tell you, if your story, uh, checks out... I'll give it a week. But first, I got to find out a little bit more information on your sister. Her name is, uh, Jane baker. 17? Right. Got any pictures of her? Yeah. That's her. You can't keep that. I need that. Don't worry. You'll get it back. I see the little, uh, resemblance there. So, um, why don't you tell me a little bit more about this-- this bad guy of yours, ok? His name is sol kupferman, and, uh... He lives--he lives just north of sunset near the Beverly Hills hotel. And it's, uh, the address is 8914 elevado. E-l-e-v-- I can spell. Just, uh, describe the guy, ok? I don't know. He's, uh... 65, skinny, salt-and-pepper hair, big nose. Typical heeb. You get the picture. I heard a lot of stuff about solly k. All bad stuff, but all rumors. Solly k? As in solly k's that burned down last night? One and the same asshole. Any idea on the fire? He has a lot of enemies. I told you, the guy's into a lot of evil shit. That Jew bastard made her hate me! All right, all right. You, uh, you simmer down, fat dog, and, uh... I'll tell you what you do. You hang loose and come back and see me when you get a little cash in your pocket, and I'll see what I can do about this-- you--you want some cash? You want a down payment? Here, I'll give it to you right now. Fritz: A lifetime in L.A. had taught me never to take anything at face value except for money. Fat dog's a good judge of character. You're ok. Here you go. You're a caddy? Yeah. [Laughs] Well, I'll tell you what. What's that? I'm giving up this job of mine and becoming a caddy. [Both laugh] Hey, hey, hey, hold on a minute. Uh, you got a phone number? You know, I move around a lot. You can reach me at the rustic inn. That's a beer bar down on Santa Monica and sawtelle. I'll get the message there. Fine. Fritz: I ignored my first warning. This case stunk right from the start. My confrontation with brother leotis' bat this morning left a bad taste in my mouth. Man, was I tired of that shit. Solly k and his love nest sounded like a nice little diversion, and it looked like I was gonna make some cash on the deal. The house was just off coldwater. It was a cute little bungalow, and the his and hers rolls royces were fire engine red. At least I wouldn't have any problem following 'em around town. At exactly high noon, sleepy but hot-looking Jane baker came out of the house. My lucky day. Solly k would have to wait his turn. I went with the girl. Now at this point, nothing really seemed out of the ordinary, except for maybe the fact that this 17-year-old girl was driving around in this amazing car, and she could barely see over the steering wheel, but considering where we were, that's not such a big deal and not so uncommon. [Piano playing] I don't like people watching me play. Oh, sorry, I... I wasn't watching you play. I--i was just--well, yeah, I was watching you, but I, uh, I was really looking for my teacher. Why don't I believe you? Well, that's, uh, probably just your upbringing, you know, never talk to strangers. That certainly wasn't my upbringing. So you play the piano? Uh, yeah... Sit. Let me hear you. Oh, no, no. No, I don't-- I don't play the piano. Well, not-- no, no, not well. I-i-I'm just starting my lessons today. How did you become interested in music? Uh, that's a long story. You don't wanna-- you don't wanna hear that. I--i should probably just go. Look who's afraid to talk to strangers now. Oh...ok, if you want to hear. Sure, I'll tell you. [Clears throat] Um, I was 21, uh, my mama just died, and I was working, uh... Uh, part-time as a gardener, living off her, uh, insurance money, um... Anyway, I, uh, had this job in Pasadena trimming a little shrubbery there, and I heard this music coming from the house. Uh, thunderous powerful stuff. It was pretty amazing. It was, uh, Beethoven's eroica. Yeah, I mean, uh, knocked me flat on my ass, and, uh, and, uh, well, I've never, uh, I've never been able to get enough of it since. So what happened? Why'd it take you this long to take a lesson? Uh, well, um, I became a cop. So you're a cop? [Laughs] Well, I wasa cop, and I was a cop before, but, you know, that's, um, that's another long, nonsensical story. You don't want-- and I have to practice, so... You'll have to save your story for another time. Yeah, I'll look forward to it. Fritz: I was never any good at this stuff. You see, it's not supposed to go this way. When you're following someone, well, they're not supposed to catch you. That night, I went back to kupferman's mansion. I had decided to get a closer look at mister solly k and hopefully sneak a peek at the young and lovely Jane baker while I was at it. [Muffled voices] Ha ha ha ha. Hey, listen... Just come on, baby. Come on. We'll watch a little TV tonight, huh? [Dog growls] [Woof woof woof] Fritz: A private eye needs to be prepared for anything. So I stopped off on my way home and bought a can of mace. The dog didn't deter me. The next morning, I followed solly k to a liquor store down on crenshaw. Not where you'd expect the Beverly Hills crowd to shop for their booze, but I guess one bottle of dom perignon tastes as good as the next. It was the rainy season, not the ideal weather to be driving around in a convertible with the top down, but it was kinda fun sometimes. Fat dog wanted pictures, so I figured I'd take a couple of shots just so he thought he's getting his money's worth. The 2 bags of booze in his trunk, I followed solly k out of L.A. And out of the rain. I couldn't imagine why this old guy was driving all the way out here. But what did it matter? It wasn't like I had anything in particular to do that day. Finally, after 2 hours, he stopped at a little gas mart. What happened next made fat dog's story start to make a little more sense. Haywood cathcart, head of internal affairs. The man who made an example of me and my drinking was accepting 2 grocery bags. It probably had nothing at all to do with booze. Although I'm sure Haywood liked the sauce as much as I did, but he was just a little bit more careful about it than me, that's all. I became his poster boy for the new clean and sober l.A.P.D. He pointed out my demise as progress. I hated the guy, and I had been waiting all this time for the chance to pay him back. Now fate had brought US back together again in the form of a caddy named fat dog baker. I had always believed I didn't need anybody's help staying sober. I'd gone to a couple of a.A. Meetings, but it just wasn't my thing. Sitting around with a bunch of weak, pathetic alcoholics didn't make any real sense to me. I went for my cousin Walter's sake. He was family, and I thought that's what he needed. [Whispering] Get me outta here. You're late, Fritz. [Whispering] I know. I'm on a case. No way. Yeah. Who--who would hire you? It's a long story. Tell you all about it later on tonight, ok? Well, I guess that means we're not going to lunch, huh? Yeah, uh, sorry about that, huh? Here, here, here. A little lunch money. That's a lot more than lunch money. Yeah, well, it's a test, Walt. You're never gonna get better unless you test yourself. Hmm? Can you do it? We'll see about that later, won't we? Fritz: The rustic inn. Must've been the only bar in L.A. I'd never had a drink in, and if I had, I didn't remember it. What a dump. It figured fat dog would do his drinking here. Get me a double bushmill straight up with coke back. I'm looking for fat dog baker. He told me I could get a line on him here. I ain't seen fat dog in a week or so. [Clears throat] Of course, if you'd like to leave a message... I'll see that he gets it as soon as he comes in. How about any of these other guys? 7 bucks. They know fat dog, where I could find him? Augie?! What can you do for him? He loops with fat dog kinda semi-regular. Why don't you go ask him? Maybe he knows, but you need to buy him a pitcher. He likes coors. Of course. [Sighs] [Clears throat] Yeah. Ahem. Ok, thanks. Augie dougal? How ya doin'? I'm a friend of fat dog baker's. You mind if I talk to you for a few minutes? You're not a cop, are ya? Cops are always lookin' for fat dog. No, no, no. I'm not a cop. You look kinda like one. Well, uh... Yeah, well, I was, but I've traded in my badge for a set of golf clubs. Yeah, the fat dog's gonna teach me the game. Oh. There ya go. Well, you picked yourself a good teacher. Nobody knows golf like fat dog. Nobody can read the Greens as well as he can, either. You put the putt where he tells ya, tch, whammo. It's in the cup. In the cup? Every time. In the cup. Ha ha ha ha ha. That's good. Yeah. Sure thing. Top that off for ya. There ya go. Listen, um, here's the deal, augie. I got this big game tomorrow, and it's kind of important that I, uh, talk to fat dog tonight. Do you happen to know where he could be? Well, he's been loopin' the bel air lately, uh, sleepin' on this hill out there by eighth hole-- wait, wait, wait. Go back a second. You're tellin' me that he's sleepin' outside? Fat dog, he don't like sleepin' indoors. Says it's bad for him. He has bad dreams. I see. What would be the best way I could find him tonight? Well, there's a gate just off of sunset. It's near the girls' school, and there's this big statue of Jesus there. Fritz: I neared the entrance augie dougal was talking about. Jesus stood guard over the student parking lot at marymont school for girls. I waited for a while and got lucky. Hey, fat dog! Got a visitor out here! Who's that? Friend or foe? It's Fritz brown, man. I gotta talk to ya. Oh, Fritz! What's up, buddy? Hey, the private eye guy. You got some good shit for the fat dog? Well, I don't know about that, but I checked it all out, and I have to agree with you. I think solly k is doing something with your sister. I mean, uh, if it was my sister, I don't know what I'd do, but... Don't you see what he's doing? He's fuckin' her, the son of a bitch! No, i--i didn't see that. I mean, I don't know. You don't know that for sure, do you? Oh, the fuckin' hell I don't. Man, listen, y-you gotta look after janey, all right? Please, just make sure nothin' happens to her. They're followin' me. Who's following you? N-No, no, no, there's nobody followingme. There's no one literally following me. No, you just told me that somebody's following you. No, there's no one-- there's no one following me. There's no--there's nobody following me, all right? Fine. Nobody's following you. Is it cathcart? What do you know about cathcart? Well, solly met with him today. That fuckin' Jew. I told him to stop, you know? I--i got money, too, you know? The fat dog's got lots of money. I-I'll give you whatever you want, ok? You just gotta look after janey, make sure nothin' happens to my sister, please. What does Haywood cathcart have to do with any of this? I told ya, solly's into a lot of evil shit. Cathcart's as evil as they come. I'll give you $10,000 to look after janey, make sure nothing happens, all right? What makes you think something's gonna happen to your sister? Don't ya understand? $10,000 for one week! Do you want the money or not? Sure. Yeah, I'll take your money, but it's like I told you before-- I get paid in full up front. That means tonight. Tonight. I can give you the money. We gotta take a ride for the cash, though. Right now? Yeah. Ok. Where to? Venice. Put the fuckin' top up. I'm freezin'. No, I like the top down. It's raining, you know. Oh, yeah. That's why it's down. I'm in a t-shirt. Yeah, you sleep outside, I drive with my top down. [Chuckles] So tell me your story, fat dog. Uh, I mean, I was a cop for 6 years, man, and I tell you what: I never met anybody as queer as you. [Chuckles] What can I say? I'm the king of the caddies. The greatest fuckin' looper that ever packed a bag. I know every course in this town like the back of my hand. Looks like hard work. Those bags ever get too heavy for ya? Naw, naw, naw, not unless you're loopin', like, hillview or brentwood. Those kikes like to pack their bags full of cement. I mean, they'll throw you some extra cash. It's just, you know, they like to feel superior while they're torturing you. You ever caddy for kupferman? No, no, no. He's got a coon packing his bags. Those Jews and niggers are like soul brothers. All right, all right, all right. Just can it, ok? I like Jews, and I like blacks, too. I grew up watching soultrain, you know. Oh, yeah. They had some hot babes on that show. So tell me, why do you sleep outside, man? You dig pussy? Sure. You ever wanted a girl that could give you everything you ever wanted, you didn't have to worry about? You didn't have to worry about this chick fuckin' other guys or-- her body is perfect, you know? Just like the one you've always dreamed about, and she's even nice to be around after ya fucked her. That's how I feel about golf courses. They're just fuckin'... Beautiful. I'm back in 10 minutes. Hey, hey, hey, babe, I ain't lettin' you outta my sight. Where you go, I go. Well, I ain't gonna show you where I keep my stash, so I guess we got ourselves a standoff. Guess so. What's it gonna be, cowboy? [Car approaching] Aw, shit! Hey, man! You know what kind of car this is, dude?! Look at this! Where's fat dog?! Fat who, man?! Hey, man, he was just here before you showed up. God, you just screwed it up for the both of US. Ow! What about the ledgers?! What'd he do with them, huh?! I don't know no ledgers! He just hired me to do a job. We know why he fuckin' hired you. I have one incredibly good piece of advice: Go back to fucking repossessing cars, man. [Speaks Spanish] Fuck you, spic! Fuck you! Yeah, come on back! !¡puta! come on, huh?! Fuck you, prick! Fritz: What was I doing? I should have stopped right then and there. This story would have been over, and all I would have had was a bruised face and a battered ego, but the hook was in too deep. Seeing Haywood cathcart got me wondering what the hell he was up to and whether or not I could somehow do to him just a little bit of what he had already done to me. I used to carry a derringer back when I was a cop. I wasn't supposed to, but I did it anyway. Still there... The 2 guys from last night. They must be working for cathcart or maybe solly, I don't know. I was starting to feel like a cop again, and I wasn't sure how I liked it. I needed some answers, though, and I knew just the place. Lulu: Fritzy! Hey, hey, hey. Lulu. May I help you? Yes, you may. Later. Tell Jackie I'm here, would you, please? [Knocking rhythmically] Lulu: He'll be right out. All right. Hey. Hey. Fritzy, baby. Hi. How are you? Hey. Um... What's with the head band? You take up tennis? What? Come on. They're back in style. Oh, yeah? Didn't you know? You look great. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. You get that other face lift there? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. So how's tricks, huh? Still got that repo gig? Hatchet man for bud Myers, huh? Yeah, yeah. Well, more or less. How 'bout you? I mean, what's the latest? Well, currently, i'm in the escort business. I provide businessmen with attractive, intelligent girls to be seen with at various functions. I see. So you're up to your old tricks. I protest, fritzy. My girls are all in college. Enough with the bullshit, ok? Come on. I'm serious. I gotta talk. Fritz: Tell me what you know about a solly kupferman. Solly kupferman?Yeah. Well, I knew him. I knew him slightly maybe, I don't know, 20 years ago when I had a chauffeur gig, you know? I used to fix him up with a limo and a driver. The guy was a financial wizard. You know, he made a bundle for the mob. What's he up to now? Solly kupferman's always up to something. How do I know? I mean, like what? Come on. You know what he's up to. Look, back in the eighties before the club utopia was burned, this guy probably handled... 200 thou a week. Triple that on super bowl Sunday. Club utopia, as in the, uh, utopia firebomb? Yeah, well, what do you got, some whore who thinks that solly k owes her a shitpot full of money? No, no, no. It's nothing like that. Heh heh heh heh. Sure, Fritz. You're a regular Dudley do-right, huh? [Cell phone rings] Yeah. Listen, fritzy. Do me a favor, will you? Stay away. These guys do things their own way for a reason. Hmm. Why is that? Because they can. [Beep] Yeah? Oh, Elizabeth, baby. Fritz: Jack was always good for color, but...i needed more. Jack: A congressman? ♪ Hey hey hey ♪ hey hey hey hey ♪ hey hey hey ♪ oh, baby... Fritz: I found myself back in venice around the same area fat dog had skipped out on me the night before. ♪ La la la la la la ♪ baby, baby, baby Fritz: Hey, hey, hey! You got a second? Always enough time and never enough wine. You know, I can, uh, take you in for that. Oh, come on. Mmm. Not that. Singing. Give me a break. Disturbing the peace. Oh! All right. Listen. Maybe you can help me out instead. I'm looking for this, uh, this uh, white guy. Big, 6'2", 6'3", 25, 300 pounds. Uh, uh, smelly, sweaty. I think he lives around here. Yeah, I know the shitbird. Wears a shirt with 2 golf clubs on the chest? That's right. And a golf cap? You got it. What are you looking for him for? Molesting little boys. I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You know, one day I was sitting on this driveway, and this shitbird tells me to move my ass. Said it was his property. He looked a little crazy to me, so I moved. Shitbird. Oh, you remember where you were? Yeah, around the corner. [Fly buzzing] Fritz: Gasoline. Fat dog knew more about the solly k fire than he let on. Fritz: I headed downtown to see Mark swirkal. Mark was the fastest process server and courthouse bulldog in L.A. I got what you wanted, Fritz, more or less. The trial was short, the transcript was short, and the story goes a little something like this. In December of 1988, club utopia, a sleazy little neighborhood bar on the corner of normandie near slauson was firebombed. 6 patrons fried to death. The surviving eyewitnesses described how 3 men who had been ejected from the bar earlier that evening returned just before closing and tossed a molotov cocktail into a crowded one-room lounge. Yeah, yeah. I remember the case. Didn't they claim there was a fourth man, though? Give me a sec. I'm gettin' to that. The 3 men were apprehended by the l.A.P.D. The arresting officer... Was detective lieutenant Haywood cathcart. 77th street division. What's this about, Fritz, huh? You're not still trying to get back at cathcart, are you? No. I shouldn't talk about it. I'm on a case. [Chuckles] So, uh, tell me a little bit more about that fourth man. Yeah, well, the 3 men admitted their culpability, but claimed the existence of a fourth man who they met outside the bar when they were thrown out. They claimed he instigated the whole thing, but no one believed them. Hmm. They say what he looked like? Yeah, it was a big guy, a red-faced guy, kind of grubby-looking, real mean, with one of those shirts with the crocodile on the pocket. I mean, they say this cat was so... Fritz: Fat dog. Mark went on talking, but I didn't hear a word he was saying. Finally, he stopped. What's the matter, brownie? Hmm? Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing, uh... Tell me a little bit about the owner of the club, why don't you? Yeah, well, it was in the name of a Wilson Edwards. Whether he was the rightful owner or not, your guess is as good as mine. I mean, it was one of those kind of clubs. Huh. Yeah. Well, hey, uh, thanks, daddy-o. It's on the house, baby. All righty. Fritz: Wilson Edwards wasn't that hard to find. He had been busted just last year for possession of heroin. A friend of mine downtown supplied me with that information along with the address. Go down and wait for me. Ok. [Knocking] Man: Eddie, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Open the door. [Coughing] You're not Eddie. That's right. I'm not. I'm a private investigator. I gotta talk to you. [Coughing] You sick? Hey, come on, uh, you can tell me. I'm not gonna hurt you. Look, look, look. I just want to ask you a couple questions. I'm not sick yet, but I will be soon. [Coughs] The great irony in that? I'm fuckin' dying of cancer, and I'm not sick yet. Oh, why don't you just make yourself at home? I gotta get rid of these shakes. [Piano music playing] [Tape rewinding] Edwards: All right. Ahem. Listen. Make this fast. I don't want you here when Eddie shows up. All right. Well... Ohhh. I just want to ask you a couple of questions about the club utopia. All right. What about it? Well, you owned the place, didn't you? That's right. [Sighs] Well, how did you, uh, put the money together to, uh, get a club like that anyway? I saved up. [Laughs] You saved up. Oh, that's bullshit. Bullshit. I mean, those tracks on your arm tell your life story. You've never had a pot to piss in except for maybe, just maybe, when you were frontin' for the real owner of the club, hmm? Well, things were different back then. I had my shit together. Don't shit a shitter, ok? Look, I just want to die in peace. You can dig that, can't you? Then why don't you tell me what I want to know, and I'll get the fuck out of your hair, hmm? What do you want to know? For starters, who really owned the club? Some guy by the name of sol kupferman, a rich guy from Beverly Hills. [Coughs] Hmm. So you ran the place for him then, right? That's right. I ran the place. Bullshit. Now who really ran the place? Who ran the place?! All right. Ok. Now, you're gonna tell me who ran the place for him, or we're just gonna sit here and wait for your friend Eddie to show up. How's that sound? [Sighs] [Coughing] [Humming] Ralston. Ralston who? Richard "hot rod" ralston. He played for the Dodgers for 5 minutes back in the late seventies. [Coughs] That's good. Good. What does he do now? Last I heard, he was still caddy master at hillview. [Coughs] Ok, that's good. Now, uh, tell me, when you were working for the club, uh, did you happen to run across any bank notes, ledgers, records of any kind? Look, I just ran the bar. I ordered the liquor, I picked up the records for the jukebox. I'm sick, and I fucking don't know anything, ok?! Ok. Appreciate your help. Thank you very much. Hey. Fuck you. [Door closes] [Country music playing] Fritz: I gotta find somebody to help me with the fat dog. See the guy with the guitar at the end of the bar? Got him. He's your man. [Sighs] Fritz: The choice between working and drinking is becoming harder and harder. I felt like just chucking it all in and going on a 9- or 10-day bender. But for 10,000 bucks, it was worth taking another shot at finding the fat dog. ♪ Daddy's line of work ♪ kept US movin' around ♪ I got fond memories of the way things were ♪ Ok. ♪ Back then... [Whistling] [Urinating and sighing] Stan the man? Police officer. Can I talk to you a few minutes? Yeah. You don't mind, do you? Go ahead. Finish up. So are you vice? No. Why do you ask? Well, I always thought of fat dog as sort of some kind of pervert, you know? Yeah? He used to be the golf ball king of all L.A. He used to have 3 hotel rooms. Nothing but golf balls in all 3 rooms. [Both laugh] Then he'd go sleep on the fifth tee at Wilshire. I mean, anybody that does that has got to be a pervert, you agree with me? I agree with you. Yeah. Listen, Stan. I need you to take me out to bel air tonight. Hmm? Fat dog's out there. He sleeps out there these days, and I gotta talk to him. Hop in the car. Ok. Stan: Well, fat dog's not here. Let's get the hell out of here. Fritz: Well, what about the back 9? Heh. Forget about the back 9. He hates the back 9. The toughest 9 holes I've ever packed. Buggy as shit. Buggy, huh? Stan, uh, tell me what you know about a Richard ralston. Richard ralston? Yeah, yeah. Richard ralston. You know the guy? He's the meanest human being I ever met. [Sighs] Smells nice around here, don't it? Mmm. Yeah, yeah. It's peaceful. You know, I tell you, it's gotta be a tough job doing what you do. A tough way to make a living. Yeah. Looping wouldn't be such a bummer if it wasn't for the guys who were looping. Hmm. I gotta tell you something. Um, i'm, uh, not really a cop. No, i'm--i'm a private investigator. You son of a bitch. I--you--i-- I knew there was something funny about you. Oh, I'm sorry. I knew it. I blew it. I'm sorry, man. You know, you can hit me if you want. But I shanghaied you out here all illegally and... Sorry about that. So how come you're looking for fat dog? Oh, he just hired me to do a little work for him. That's all. But mostly, I, uh, I repossess cars. [Laughing] Now that's funny. That's funny. Yeah? I used to steal cars. No shit. Did 18 months for it. It's a hard habit to kick. [Laughs] Oh, I tell you, that's, uh-- when you think about it, that's about all I do. Except they don't send me to jail. That sounds like a hell of a good job. Yeah? Yeah. Well, you know, it-- it has its good days. I'll tell you what. Why don't you give it a try, huh? Let me give you one of my cards. And, uh... There you go. Give me a call. You might get a kick out of it. Fritz: Wally! Come on out! [Knocking] Fritz: I stopped by my cousin Walter's place. I hadn't seen him in a couple of days, and I was wondering how much of that 50 bucks he had gone through. Wake up, baby. Wally, where you at?! Hey, if you're screwing with me again, I'm gonna kick your ass! Come on! Where are you at? [Walter coughing] Got you! Hey, man! Oh, hey, buddy. Hey, hey! You're dead meat. I got you. You little bitch. Oh, man. Oh, you're bad. Come on, come on. They were looking for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. Come on. I had to run away. Come on. Get up, baby, get up. I don't want to get up. [Grunts] Oh, I had to run away. Ok, here, put this on. Oh, man, I don't feel so good. Hold on. I haven't had a drink all day. What are you talking about, man? Do it yourself. It's all right. They looked like leger. Ok. Leger. Leger. French cubist. What'd they look like? Tell me-- so what would I be doing with a dead French cubist? What did they look like? I didn't see too well. It's ok. Tell me what they looked like. It was dark. It was dark. I couldn't see, man. But when they got mad, they were speaking Spanish. Fritz: Look... I know what you want and I know what you need. What you want and what you need are 2 different things. I know what I need, Fritz. And it's not a doctor. No. Unless... No. She's, uh... She's a, you know... Uh-uh. Ain't happening. You know the last time I dipped my wick was August 19, 1993? It's embarrassing. Help me out. Help me out. Yeah. Drink it. Yeah, it was that cop groupie you set me up with. Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah. I remember that. I almost lost my job on that one. Oh, she was something. She was something. I know. God. Fritz, I'm lonely, man. Help me out, will you? Just do this for me. Ok. Ok, fine. You're gonna-- ah-- done, ok? But ain't nobody gonna do anything unless you take a bath first. Oh, hey. Is that ok? Yeah. You're a pal. Ok. Hop on. I know a gal that'll take good care of you for a couple of days at least. Great big tits? What, are you picky now? Yeah, yeah. She's got big melons. Don't worry about it. And you know what else? She's gonna like you, man. She's gonna dig you a lot because you're an intellectual. She likes the intellectual type. Very good. Raw tin, Fritz. Raw tin. That's his last-- ralston. Yeah, I know. Don't worry. Fritz: The guy with Jane baker looked kind of like an ex-ball player. Richard ralston. Had to be. What a gentleman. Everything started coming together in a way I still didn't understand. All I knew was... Richard! I had to keep going. Fritz: I followed Richard ralston into the hillview country club. I told them at the gate that I was there to meet solly kupferman for a quick 9. They believed me. Ralston: Fat dog got himself in some big trouble. He fucked with the wrong people. You're probably not gonna see him again, augie, not ever. Augie: What did he do, rod? Now, this is a real heavyweight scene, augie. Heavy-duty shit. I mean, heavy-duty. Did he tell you about it? No, he didn't tell me no heavy-duty shit, rod. Just looping and racetrack stuff. Honest! Are you sure about that, augie? I'm sure. Honest, rod, honest. Fat dog ripped off a ledger, augie. I needthat ledger. Now, you know fat dog's rich, don't you, augie? Loaded. Heavy bread. And guess what? It's rightfully mine. I want... That money. What do you know about that, augie, huh? I don't know where he keeps his money, rod, and I never saw no ledger. Ok, augie. One more thing. Then I'll let you go. I got a juicy 9-holer waiting for you. Where do you think the fat dog is, augie? T.j. Gotta be, rod. He--he--he's been talking about racing dogs, and I ain't seen him in 2 days. You are a good man, augie. And a good caddy. Fritz: "Hot rod" ralston. Oh, he was gonna get his due, all right. Yes, he was. But he'd have to wait his turn. I needed to find the fat dog. After a little poking around, I discovered that Tijuana had its own country club. It's a giant patch of green in an otherwise brown landscape. I thought maybe I could get a lead on the king of caddies there. No reembolso. No-- no refund. English? You speak English? Yeah. Yeah? Well, I just need a little information. I'm looking for this caddy. American guy. Big. 6'2". 285-300 pounds. Wears dirty golf clothes-- yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the guy. I know the guy. He laid some golf balls on me a couple days ago. Do you know where I could find him? Nah. He's just a bum. Fly-by-night. Well, did he talk to you about anything other than golf balls? Yeah. As matter of fact, he wanted to know where he could buy some racing dogs. I thought he was just shittin' me. He didn't look like he had the kind of money to be buying no racing dogs. Then he pulls out a roll. A couple of grand. I'm like, "fuck me!" You know, the vato's got this kind of money and he's selling golf balls? He's crazy. He's got something in his head wrong, you know? So you sent him to the dog track? Hell, no! I sent him to primo Armando'shouse. He's got a litter of greyhound pups, man. Beautiful. Why, you interested? Uh, no, no, no. How do I find your primo Armandoguy? Who are you, man? Look, I'm a good guy. I just want the retard that sold you the golf balls, that's all. Fritz: I went with my newfound friend way the hell out in the middle of nowhere. After 2 hours of driving, I wasn't sure what to expect. By now, though, I was ready for anything. [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Armando, this is, uh-- what's your name again? Buto. Buto. Mr. Smart buto, huh? [Chuckles] My cousin says that, uh... You're trying to find that fat gringo I sold 2 dogs to. That's right. It's gonna cost you $200. [Chuckles] All right, no problem. Where is he? I'll tell you where he is when you show me the money. It's coming. It's coming. Keep your shorts on. There you go. [Laughs] So, where is he? You gonna fuck him up, gringo? Maybe. Maybe not. Where's he at? Fritz: I'd had enough. I was about ready to blow it all, but I held it in and let the Mexicans play their mind game with me. That fat gringodeserves everything he gets. I got a feeling about him. I got a feeling about you, too, gabacho. So, I want to tell you. You take that blue thing up that road towards town, look for the blue church. You'll find him. [Flies buzzing] Fritz: Something was up. I could smell it. [Dog growls] [Growling] Fritz: The same stench that lingered in the yard doubled as I came through the door. [Squeaking] It was Frederick "fat dog" baker. Caddy... Arsonist... And the one man I thought could answer all my questions. The shack was empty, but fat dog never slept inside. Uhh! [Laughs] Uhh! Fritz: A thorough search of the area turned up Frederick "fat dog" baker's worldly possessions, including a bunch of ledgers that Mr. Ralston and the 2 Mexican guys from L.A. Had been looking for. Whoever murdered fat dog would sure as hell like to get their hands on these. He deserved a burial, but I wasn't about to do the digging. You can get any service you want down here as long as you got the money. [Speaks Spanish] Keep digging. [Groaning] Uhh! [Gunshots] Ohh! Aah! [Rapid gunfire] Uhh! [Fritz drops body] [Fritz breathing hard] Ralston: Fat dog got himself in some big trouble. He fucked with the wrong people. Fat dog: I told ya, solly's into a lot of evil shit. Cathcart's as evil as they come. [Groans] Fritz: Now the craving wasn't stopping. I couldn't resist any longer. As soon as I hit Ensenada, I stopped at the first liquor store I could find. Paranoia had set in. The fire might spread, the tire marks at the scene can be traced back to me and there were these 4 unexplained dead bodies. Fear breeds fear, and alcohol kills it. At least it does for me. My mind was raging, but I was perfectly calm. For one split second, clarity hit and I knew exactly what the consequences would be. But I didn't care anymore. [Voices echoing] Armando: That fat gringo deserves everything he gets. Fat dog: I told ya, solly's into a lot of evil shit. Cathcart's as evil as they come. [Voices echoing] That fuckin' Jew. I told him to stop. I got money, too. [Voices echoing] [Laughing] Fat dog: I told ya, solly's into a lot of evil shit. Cathcart's as evil as they come. Edwards: Look, I just want to die in peace. You can dig that, can't you? Fritz: No matter how much I drank, my mind just wouldn't let go. And no matter how hard I tried, I just kept thinking, remembering. It took me 2 days to get sober, but I finally got my shit together and drove back to L.A. I'll take it from here. Key, please? Shh. Bye.see ya. What? What the hell do you think you're doing? Get out of my car! Calm down. My name's Fritz brown. I'm a private investigator. Your name is Jane baker, you like playing the piano, and your roommate's sol kupferman. Your big brother fat dog enjoys collecting golf balls and starting fires. Now get in. I want to talk to you. Get in and shut the door. Shut the door! [Tires screech] It belongs to you. How did he die? I don't think you want to hear any more about that. It was horrible? Well, let's just say that I'm gonna have nightmares for the rest of my life. How do you know Richard ralston? From hillview. I used to tag along when Freddy was a caddy there. How well do you know hot rod? What do you mean? I think you know what I mean. Do you mean, um... Did he ever fuck me? What's the big deal? Yeah, we had an affair briefly a few years ago. You had an affair? You're 17 years old. I mean, come on. Several years ago you were, what, 13? There was a time that I loved Richard. Well, ok. Well, I got some news for you. Your lover boy dick ralston is responsible for your brother's death. [Chuckles] I don't believe you. [Laughs] Not for one second. [Laughs] You're just some loser p.I. You know what, you can believe what you want to believe. But I'm telling you it's a fact. Richard ralston got paid money to give to 2 guys to kill your brother. Now, in my opinion, I believe the money came from sol kupferman. Fuck you! Fuck you! You don't know US! You don't know him! I'm gonna go tell solly. He already knows. [Crying] Jane: What am I supposed to do?! [Jane crying] [Knocks] Fritz: I went over to Helen's place to check and see how everything went with Wally. [Knocking] Only she would've taken him in the shape he was in. Hey. What a gal. If she wasn't a whore, I'd marry her. Where's he at? I've been calling you. Calling me? Walter's not here. Well, where'd he go to? He's in the hospital. [Monitor beeping] Fritz: It was me and his brother Mike that taught him how to drink, party, fuck, and fight. But Wally was only good at one of 'em. It was at this point that I wondered why I hadn't just walked away. And now I couldn't. [Ralston whistling Dixie] That's right, Mr. Ralston. It's a gun. It's loaded, but I'm not. Next stop, maintenance shack. Now put your arms down and just walk normal, please. Look, I want you to know I only got $65 on me. I lost tonight. You'd have done better to catch some of the other guys. I'm almost flat broke-- now, listen to me, you prick. Tonight you're gonna pay for some of your past sins, and you're gonna tell me everything I want to know. Ohh! Now... I know most of it, but you're gonna fill in some of the pieces for me. And if you don't... I'm gonna go internal on ya and bang your kidneys until you piss blood. How's that sound to ya? Look, you can do whatever you want, but I don't know anything. You don't know anything? Huh? How's that? Huh? What side are those damn kidneys on? Do you know?! Uhh! Uhh! Are those your kidneys? Huh?! You wear me out. Now... Let's give this a try, shall we? Come on up. [Ralston gasping] Stop whining! Fritz: Now, are you concerned that they'll get at you for talking to me? Is that a yes? Yes. [Stops recorder] Look at it this way. They might kill you for talking to me here tonight, but that's an unknown factor. Me... I'm a fact. I'm the here and now. And if you don't talk to me, you will die here and now. That's absolute. [Chuckles] Dig? Good. Now... [Starts recorder] Let's go. Cathcart and solly are working a welfare check scam. Fake welfare checks? Don't those checks have to be signed in front of the people paying out the money? Yeah, but solly's got over 2 dozen liquor stores and partnerships in a couple of dozen others. All the checks get cashed there. The ledgers that fat dog stole, they contain documentation on that, am i-- am I right? Yes. How did you know about that? [Stops recorder] Hmm? I ask the questions here. Understand me? Mm-hmm. Ohh! All right. How's this scam work exactly? Solly forges the applications. Case workers submit them for approval and-- and supervisors working for cathcart authorize payment. He's even got a guy in Sacramento monitoring the computer checks. It's--it's-- it's foolproof. How much money do they pull in a month? I don't know. Hundreds of thousands. Cathcart's filthy rich. Who told you I was involved in this case? Jane baker. We've been friends for years and--uhh! Don't you fucking ever mention her name to me again! Ohh! You pervert. Now... [Starts recorder] Stop whining! Does cathcart plan on having me killed? Yes. He's got somebody after you now. He thinks you're holed up somewhere drunk and afraid. This tape... Is going someplace safe. If I don't check in at regular intervals, it goes straight to the press. You dig? Yeah. I stay healthy... You stay safe. Fritz: I gave Mark the tapes, and I told him what I wanted. Should I fail to contact his answering service once during every 24-hour period with the message "crazy daddy-o," he should immediately tape a dozen copies and hand-deliver them to the press. I trusted him. He was a solid, good man. I was now officially on the run, but I decided to risk it and head back to my place and pick up a few things. Long night? Yeah, I'm having the place redecorated, and I'm staying in a hotel. I'm sergeant Larkin, riverside county sheriff's department. Sergeant cavanah, l.A.P.D. Could we talk to you? Inside? Yeah, why not? [Keys jingle] Fritz: Come on in. [Door closes] You have a permit for that weapon, Mr. Brown? Ah, yes, I do, and I have a permit to carry it concealed. I'm a licensed private investigator. Ooh. Wow.i see. Have a seat. Do you own any other weapons? Yes, I own a Browning pump shotgun. Could we see that? What's this all about? Where were you last night between 10 P.M. and 2 A.M.? I told you. I'm staying at a hotel. I was in my room. You check into that. Yeah. Do you know a man named Stanley gather, a.k.a. Stan the man? Yeah, yeah. I met him once briefly a short while ago. Why? [Gun cocks] [Shell bounces off the floor] Your business card was found on his body. [Laughs] Yeah. [Clears throat] Murdered? Oh, yeah. Down in palm Springs along with 2 other guys. Caddies. Their bodies were found underneath a freeway overpass. Shotgun? Cavanah: 6 expended shells were found. Their bodies were blown all to shit. So, how'd you meet gather? What was the basis of your relationship? Well, what relationship? Hmm? I met him in a bar, he bought me a drink, and, uh, started telling me about himself... How he was a-- how he was a compulsive car thief, and he was doing therapy to control his compulsion, huh. I told him I was in the repo business, and I might be able to help him get started ripping off cars legally. He took my card, and, uh-- fuck, I haven't seen him since. Ever met a George Hansen, also known as hamburger? Or a Robert "Bobby" marciane? No, no, I haven't. Why? Are they the other 2, uh-- that's right. Do you know any other caddies? No. No, I don't play golf. It's not my idea of kicks. What is your idea of kicks? Great music, beautiful women. What's yours? Bitch-slapping lying scumbags. Hmm. Don't fuck with US, brown. See, I pulled up your personnel file this morning, and I found out that you're a fuck-up and a disgrace to your department. Now we are investigating a multiple homicide, and we don't have to take shit from some repo asshole. Well, boys, I tell you what. If that's all you got, if that's all you have to tell me, why don't you just leave? Hmm? I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get the door for ya. Ladies? [Chuckles] You watch your step, brown. I'm personally keeping my eye on you. You have no idea how excited that makes me. Fritz: It was on the bottom of page one. Not much, but the address of George Hansen might be worth something. [Doorbell buzzes] Yes? Are you Mrs. Hansen? Are you from the police? Because they told me I could wait a few days before making my statement. No, no, no. My name is brown. I'm a private investigator. I'm here looking into the murders here in palm Springs and a couple other related things, and I thought maybe you might, uh, talk to me just for a few minutes. Do you mind? All right. Come on in. Thank you. I'll try to make this brief. I believe that the death of your husband and his 2 friends can be traced directly back to a Richard ralston and a Frederick "fat dog" baker. You know these 2 men? Um, George has been doing business with... Fred if you can call it that. They have, um, thousands of golf balls at some tacky motel room in Los Angeles. Do you know who might have the key now? Well, I've got it here somewhere. You can have it if I can find it. I've really had enough of golf balls and golf bums. Oh, here it is. You know, I've been sober now for, um... 3 years. I've got a higher power in my life, so... Here. Take 'em. Thank you. How do you know Richard ralston? George and I have been friends with dick ralston for years. They used to play minor league baseball together when they were teenagers. As a matter of fact, he got, um... George started as a caddy, and, um, George and I were foster parents to Freddy baker and his little sister when they were just children. You were foster parents to fat dog baker and his sister Jane? Yes. When was this? 1984. How did that, uh, come about anyway? A friend I knew arranged it. He was a wonderful man, an old friend, and he knew that George and I wanted children very badly and... Couldn't have any. He paid US really well for taking care of those children. I loved them so much. They were just... Little orphans. Your, uh, friend, could you tell me his name? Sol, sol kupferman. Kupferman. I see. Fritz: Back in L.A., my next stop was at the hall of records. Theory had been forming in the dark corner of my brain. Clerk: Kupferman. Send him out to the car. Come on out to the back in here. [Sighs] [Chuckles] Well, Mr. Brown. We finally meet face to face, huh? Are you about to tell me what it is you want? What are you gonna give me? I'm about to honor any requests. [Laughs] The great solly k is gonna give me, Fritz brown, whatever he wants. Real white of you. I know fat dog hired you to keep an eye on Jane, but he attempted to kill me. Why would he want to do that? Why would he want to kill you? Well, I don't think he liked the fact that i-- [chuckles] That Jane was living in my house. I can't imagine why. Oh. He was unusually close to Jane. Well, I would say that you're unusually close to Jane, don't you think? Yes, well, Jane and I are, uh-- are what? Lovers? Look, Mr. Brown, I don't think any of this really concerns you. Call me Fritz, ok? And don't kid yourself. I'm very concerned here. You see, I don't think little girls should be sleeping with their daddies. Look, Mr. Brown, uh-- Fritz. Jane and I are not-- be careful what you tell me. Your whole way of life depends on it. Now, the way I see it, cathcart's blackmailing you. He nailed fat dog for the club utopia firebombing, and you didn't want your little boy going to jail, nor did you want to be killed by him either, and while cathcart knows how to control little Freddy, or should I say, knew how to control little Freddy. What do you want, Fritz? I don't know. Little revenge. [Laughs] Does that make me a bad person? Look, it's not that simple. Cathcart-- he's--he's too protected. He's beyond the law. Cathcart-- cathcart is the law. Let me worry about cathcart. You just tell Jane to pack her bags and get the hell out of there. Give her whatever she wants. Tell her whatever you want to tell her. Send her off to a real music school, but just get her the hell out of that house. Well, what if she doesn't want to leave? Well, then, I'll just have to tell her her real last name. Don't mess with me. Stay out of my way... And nobody will ever find out what a... Sick, old, disgusting pervert you really are. Oh, yeah. I know everything. Get out of my sight... Before I blow your guts all over this counter. Fritz: I bought a throwaway gun, untraceable, with a silencer. It'll do the job. P.A.: Announcing the arrival of bus number 12 from Las Vegas at gate 2. Now boarding del mar, departing gate 4, del mar from gate 4, have your tickets ready, please. Fritz: I got to a pay phone. I left my password with Mark swirkal's answering service. Crazy daddy-o. Hey, buddy. Fritz: Then there was nothing left to do but the deal itself. [Car alarm blaring] [Alarm stops] Fritz: You can put that gun down now. [Groans] Fritz: I figured it was all over. Cathcart's gun had gone off, and someone had to have heard it. [Man grunting] [Footsteps] Fritz: I woke a bit groggy. An hour or so had passed and still no cops, but I wasn't exactly safe. Not yet anyway. When I looked at him, I knew he knew who I was. Get up. Come on. Fritz: He had been waiting for me, and his kevlar service vest saved his ass. What did you hope to accomplish by coming here tonight? How stupid and naive can you be? Don't you realize that ralston and solly k have as much to lose as I do? Fritz brown. Unbelievable. You were the worst scumbag ever to con his way into the department. No. I was bush-league compared to you. Can I get you anything before we say good-bye? [Groans] Yeah. I want a $1 million welfare check presented to me by you on national TV. You do, huh? How does it feel to know that what you've done here tonight will ultimately be judged as the biggest fuck-up of your fucked-up life? On the contrary. What I've tried to do here tonight is the one saving grace of my fucked-up life. [Groans] How about a drink, huh? Sure. Why not? Brown. You come from good stock. You're a big, strong boy. You know, you can still be of service. Just a question of, uh-- re-education, you know? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. TV: We'll have all of that for you and also let you know about the weekend. In other news today, veteran l.A.P.D. Officer Haywood cathcart died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound sometime over the weekend at his fishing retreat in del mar. He had been a 28-year veteran... Fritz: I sat in the hotel room for 2 days, waiting for 'em to finally find the body. The l.A.P.D. Reported it as suicide. They must have had a pretty good idea of what he was up to. Eh, what the hell did I care? I was alive... And free. After a couple of weeks, I went around to check up on Jane. I wanted to make sure that this solly k guy was living up to his side of the bargain. Maid told me that she was at the hospital. Cedar sinai. Jane. Jane. You all right? You don't have to tell me. Fritz: What could I do? She made her choice. There was nothing more I could say. I remembered the key the widow Hansen lady gave me. I decided to take a drive out to the, uh, la Plaza motel. [Sighs] [Chuckles] [Golf ball bounces] [Laughs] [Sighs] [Hums] [Laughs] Fritz: Just when I thought I had found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, Walter's condition took a turn for the worse. He died 3 weeks later. He was 32. Helen drove me to the funeral. I got drunk and disrupted it. You fuckers. Leave him alone! You're hurting him! Fritz: Well, that's my story, most of it anyway. Still, I can't remember why I had that first drink. All I know now is that I've got plenty of money to buy another. I miss Walter. One night, I'm gonna steal his coffin, and I'm gonna bring it down to the beach. I'll have a boat waiting there... And I'll send him off the right way. He'll float out to a fiery Valhalla.
