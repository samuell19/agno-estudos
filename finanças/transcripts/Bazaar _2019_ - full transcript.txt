Hearty Welcome. Pigeons. We all know how pigeons are born. From an egg to a bird that adorns the sky. You must have seen a lot of pigeons in the sky. They are called ‘Junglee’ But there’s an entire world of pigeons unknown to most of us. The one who trains a pigeon and teaches it to fly is called ‘Shokhdhar’ Some people spend their entire life trying to become ‘Shokhdhars’ While some have died trying to be one. To watch a Shokhdhar training the bird, especially the way he trains it to eat is brilliant. There are a lot of breeds, Tara, Tambral, Cheeni, Laqua,Tiravel, Bhoori, Roshan, Humar. Shokhdhar trains these breeds to take part in tournaments. There’s a history to tournaments like these. You shall witness this in our story. It’s held in many places in India, and a few streets in Bengaluru. For some it’s a hobby, for some pride, for some it is an addiction and for some it is rivelry. These tournaments happen During Krishna Janmasthami. Pigeons are the symbol of love, and a reflection of peace. But there is an unbreakble link to this world of pegions and the Underworld Today is Krishna Janmastami. We all have got together after a long time. Let us have some real fun today. Welcome. The great people of Malgudi. We welcome you to grand festivities of Krishna Janmasthami The winner of this competition will be gifted an idol of Lord Krishna. 10 teams had registered to be a part of this competition. - The teams have to smash a pot of curd. Of which 7 teams have already bitten the dust. We can’t reach the pot even if we do a headstand. It’s impossible to not slip on the gallons of oil they pour. Puttur Team having won numerous awards across the state are performing really well. We request the crowd to give them a huge round of applause. They’ve gone way higher than the other teams. Wow! What a performance. And they fall like Humpty Dumpty. Who broke the pot? Nobody can. They have poured oil there. We need a hero to break it. Welcome the next team, Bhajarangi. Climb. Hold tight!. They’ve poured oil everywhere, If we do this then our bones will definitely break. We can see fear in their eyes, but what we can’t see is the Big Brother entering the contest. Everybody has been waiting for his arrival. Come on!. Cheer Up!. He has finally entered the scene! Look at his swag.. It’s now time to witness Here comes the Bhaijaan! He leaps off the ground and smashes the pot! Look at our boss! Dude come let’s leave. I’ve arranged for a party upstairs get soda while coming. Also don’t forget to bring the snacks.

Try taking the professional approach to your personal things, she may understand. It’s okay sir, I’m used to this. You take a call on all my designs. I wish you could take a call on my life too. Ive known you since a lot of years. There’s something I want to share. Please tell me. You work really hard. Will you marry me? This color suits this saree really well.. And if you marry me, we will suit each other very well. Take your time and think about this. I don’t think I can go home and think I will take a little time and think about it here only. Sir, I’m using your laptop. Do you think these two go well with each other? No. Color doesn’t match. Just like how this doesn’t go well, our family status also doesn’t go well. Don’t listen to your heart, he always cheats us. You’re a good person, both professionally and personally. Look for somebody that suits… Get this costume ready by Wednesday. Hey Shobdhaar! Can I take this pigeon? I’ll pay you whatever you ask for! This is the first pigeon my mother nurtured, she made it fly, and fed it . When she passed away, we both had tears. It started flying then and hasn’t stopped ever since. That’s why I’ve named it ‘Amma’ I didn’t know. Mothers should always win. Which pigeon flies well? All of them do. But none of them fly more than 3 hours. Instead of making our pigeon a winner, we could make a winning pigeons ours. Let’s let our pigeon fly and the change its color. Amma, the pigeon is the only one in this race. Apart from that there’s Yajamana’s pigeon. Won’t Yajamana get angry? If he gets in our way, we shall kill him too. I was kidding. Should I speak to Parkour? Dad. Dad. I have to talk to her today. Dad! What are you doing? That’s our source of income. Yeah! Now we’re drinking Because of that. The one who gets people drunk should be thrashed first. I wanted to make it look like you were hallucinating. It didn’t work out. Why have you come here? Should I beat around the bush? Or do you want me to cut straight to the point. Come straight to the point. I’m telling it only because you asked me. I love you. What? See you’re asking for it once again. I Love You. I’ll kill you. I can go down on my knees for you, just like other boys. But, I think all that is too pretentious. I believe in being simple and honest. I will love you more than you can ever handle. Will you serve scrumptious meals if at all I go to jail? Why? So that I can kill you, get arrested and never come back. Why shouldn’t you fall in love with me? Listen to your heart once. My mom lost everything only because she listened to her heart. My mother always said don’t listen to your heart It always dances to somebody else’s tunes. Instead listen to your mind, it always stays ahead of the curve. Neither my heart, nor my mind will accept you. Does that mean you won’t love me at all? No way. I love you, but you don’t. This means I’ve failed in love. I will keep professing my love, you continue rejecting it. Get lost. I have a million things already, along with it I’ll have to deal with this too. I’m a failure in love. If I quit drinking will I get her back? Listen Kid, if a girl leaves you the bottle will hold you. But if you leave the bottle a girl will not hold you. Even if Pari scolds it sounds like music. = Not me. Remember the lines on stage. Be careful. You’re giving a lot of things of these kids. Don’t you feel like giving something to me too? Are you in your senses? Don’t you know how to speak in front of children? You will never prosper in life. You are again angry at me. I failed in love again. I can’t stand this anymore. Don’t cry uncle. Let this costume teacher go, Our drawing teacher is better than her. Why would I cry like I’m diagnosed with Sugar? This isn’t something to feel bad, I’m in love and that’s super. I have failed I love. It feels nice to have tears for company. It’s okay even if you chide me. You stay in my heart even while you’re away. Devadasa hasn’t realised your beauty Laila Majnoo seem to have earned your wrath. I dance around in your love. I pray for you in the name of love failure. Love failure! To experience it is super. Bless everybody in this room. Happiness will enter your home. Who is Kalki's parents? Why did you have to give birth to such a son? Your son is a rogue, the least you could do is raise him well. Ask your son not to trouble me. I don’t believe in love. This is the happiness I was talking about. Its upto you and him, you solve it amongst yourselves. We can’t tell anything to kids these days. Neither will you prosper nor will your son prosper. Can we do a puja to ensure that my son’s wedding happens peacefully? It’ll cost a little. Irrespective of whom the wallet belongs money should come to you right? Whatever we do, we do it for food. Neither will I prosper nor will my son prosper. Choose one of these two. Choose one Chennai will lose today. A meritorious student gets a lot of offers. But a failure needn’t worry, there’s always a plan written for him too. Nobody sympathises with you, even after you miss out on being a Chief Minister. But if you fail in love, the entire world sympathises with you. What we do? And how do we do it, should be told. Why are we doing it? Even that will be told. People listening to us, and then drifting away.. People drowning in love is common after all. Your final words? Love failure! To experience it is super. One of your boys has fallen in love with me. Guys fall in love, you say yes if you want to say yes. What’s your decision? I’ve told him that I’m not interested, yet he pesters me. What’s for lunch today? Minced meat. Have you sent somebody to get it? Yes. Ask him not to get it. Show the one troubling you. I’ll mince him to pieces. Not any of these. Kalki! Our Kalki? Ask him to bring meat. Okay. You are so pretty. Come join us for lunch. Even Kalki will come by then. He loves mutton. I came here to get rid of him, Not to know about his likes and dislikes. Pari has taken your number. Why? Why are you pestering me? Are you mad? How shameless can you be? Don’t you have any shame? What nonsense is this? I’ll gouge your eyes out. I saw you in her glowing eyes I pledged my life to it. The thought of her makes me skip my heartbeat. Her memories have been etched in my heart forever. Love is the biggest addiction of all. Love is the biggest addiction of all. Why did I want all of this? You would be a slave if you had passed in love, and a king if you fail in it. What’s your closing lines? Love failure! To experience it is super. I was listening to your show. It’s a recorded show. I couldn’t finish your work yesterday, will finish it tomorrow. Check on the other side. It could be behind the tank. What happened? Who plays rugby here? What’s that? It’s not here too. For others this is a winning pigeon, for me it’s a replica of my mother. A mother will never let her kids suffer. This pigeon belongs to the royal clan, winning it’s heart isn’t easy. but you have a good heart, I’m sure it’ll stay with you. I’ll win it over. Why is Parijatha calling.

Have you come to meet Kalki? Looks like you’ve planned something. Your age is such! But Kalki is not like everybody, He’s like our son. What about his parents? Oh Them? He is a retired school master.. He mortgaged his house for his son's business. Son left them to repay the loan and they ended up on the street. I may not be your son, But I’ll stand for you. I’ll take care of you both, Much better than your son. Come let’s stay together. This world is filled with jealousy, Envy, treachery, selfishness. But Kalki isn’t like that, he believes that everybody should be happy. He’s like a smouldering iron, You need to give him a proper shape.

What did he even order? I didn’t understand a thing. Stylishly ask her - Then what else? How was your day? Then what else? How was your day? Day was fine! Hey look at the train. I’ve also been practising to speak in English. What’s this? It’s the same thing that you ordered. Oh God! Please send people who know english. Did she speak like this on that day too? Yes! I’m leaving, you both continue talking. Why? Both of you don’t know the language, She’s blabbering things while you nod. Just ask her to stop speaking and leave. Settle my bill too. My language will also be spoilt if I sit here. Please Stop! I know you don’t know English. I’ve learnt the language in 2 days. Those who climb mountains will never find climbing stairs difficult. English is just another language, not a status symbol. Look at Dr.Rajkumar, he’s evergreen because he spoke Kannada. Love doesn’t need English language, all it needs is a little space in your heart. I’ll make space for you, will you also do it for me? I’ll love you, but you won’t. I failed in love. Kalki, the only one who wants everybody around him to be happy. Mom! I’ve followed my mind, Based on your instructions. But I love him a lot, Can I listen to my heart this time? There seems to be some link to this pigeon and her. Hello! I want to speak to you. Tell me. Not like this, I want to meet and talk to you. Can we meet tomorrow? Tomorrow is Yajaman's Birthday. I need to go to temple. Can I come along? Will you come? Okay. Get down. Road under maintenance. Turn right. There was nothing happening this morning. I want to profess my feelings towards him, you also tell him. I’ve got her too. Let me call any of my boys. Kalki! In whichever way I think You’re not the one I dreamt about. But at times a heart wants what it wants. If you change for me, I will also change for you. Shall I tell him? I dint realise when I fell for you. I love you, Kalki! How dare you propose me? A woman should always stay true to her words. Didn’t you say that you listen to your mind and not heart? You’ve changed now, what if you change in the future too? What do you mean? So all your life, you’ll fall behind me, and I’ll have to rebuke you? Is this love according to you? What do you know about me? Anything can happen to me, There’s no guarantee to my life. Is it? Your blood is apparently salty. Listen to it properly. It must’ve also told about my brass balls. Ask all the filthy worms wriggle out of their holes. We thought Yajaman would come. Looks like it’s your turn instead. I wanted a few heads to adorn our walls, Thought you all would fit. My name is now carved on his bones. Let him take it. This is a different marriage. She’s the one tying knot here. Tie it properly. Today is the day where you’ll be the bride and the widow. Thanks to the rains nobody will know you wet your pants in fear. Stop Showing off! Kalki! You go from here. You all have 9 minutes left. You go. No I won’t. Go. I’ll wait for you. Shall I make the noose tighter? Catch them. Stop running. Don’t let them go. Kalki! Kalki! You will now live forever. We are even now. I’ve repaid your debt. It’s high time we kill Yajaman! Somebody has come! It’s stallone’s cousin, the terror cop. How did he find out about us? Holding this is so much fun. I’ve heard about torture. But I have never seen it. All of you stand in a line. It’s a cigarette sir. We can file a Ganja case too. I thought you’ll kill him completely, but you couldn’t do that too. Whats the point of letting him go? We haven’t done anything sir. And like idiots you’ve left The weapon at the crime scene. Your fingerprints are there in this. I don’t think I should delve into the details. Who is the idiot who left it there? Is it you? Is it you? Sir he’s a good boy. Hold this. Hold this now. Haven’t you seen movies? Don’t you know how to hold it. See this is how you hit that day too. There’s no use at all. Oh! You’ve assaulted a policeman. He doesn’t have fear at all. Hit me. Sir! Everybody sit. Sir! Please sir. What does all the cop movies say? Don’t indulge in crime, it doesn’t pay. Stop saying the same thing, It’s boring. What did I say when I came here. Sir you wanted to leave a mark on their backs. Look at this. I’ll kill that inspector. Don’t do anything to him. We haven’t told your name at all. I sense something is wrong here. It wont end up good. He’s warned you too. Lets stay away for a few years. We got caught because of him. Yet, we tried to safeguard him. If he can’t stand for us why should we do it? Kill him! Pull him inside. Kalki! Stop. What’s wrong with you? Why are you drinking like this? I used to propose her all these days. She would reject it. Today, she proposed me. I couldn’t accept her proposal. I even slapped her today. Now she will be drinking too. I’m going to stay away from her. Let her be happy wherever she is. All these days you were pestering her But now you’ve fallen in love with her for real. *Sings a Folk Song* Why don't you eat? Are you trying to have a staring contest with me? Haven’t you recuperated yet? One week and I’ll be fine. I feel like my hands are tied. It would be nice if I held a weapon. A cow thinks about rearing But you’re a bull who always wants to… Can I take part in the tournament this year? Kalki. I respect pigeons more than my life. This competition has a legacy to it. Earlier Kings used pigeons to send messages. Enemies would wait for pigeons to rest, and then kill it to steal the messages. This became a big hurdle for the kings. Kings then came up with a tournament to find out the longest flying pigeon. That is when Shokhdhar was born. Slowly this tournament became a matter of pride for royal families. Slowly things started getting violent. As years passed by, the tournament changed according to time. But is still held in many parts of the country. Not just in India, it’s held across the world. I didn’t know you had such a big history. I always wanted to be a Shokhdar. But now I want to be the biggest Shokhdar. Pari, Eat! Please eat! Pari is here. Brother, how is your health now? It didn’t eat when I fed it. Look at it eating now. Kalki, was saying it hadn’t eaten from 3 days. Look how it’s eating now. Mom. I had complained about Kalki to you. You had told me Kalki is your son. And me your daughter in law. It’s time to make it happen. Look at him. He hasn’t been talking to me. Even the pigeon likes her. Why don’t you like her? The happiness I get out of failure is more than what I get when I pass. I was born on the streets, I might die there too. I might die anytime.. Shut up! Aren’t we all there? Have some coffee. Feed it well. It has to win. The tournament schedule has come. Brother, you are the main sponsor. They had called me. I’ve spoken to them. How much does Gunja fly? 7-8 hours brother. Which other pigeon did you try? Bookie, Lara, Silver, all three are ready. Whichever Amma chooses we will fly her. Who else is participating? Hampa, Manju, Prakash are participating. But we have great chances of winning. Chances are for losers. We are winners. Okay sir. Rules of this tournament The pigeon will have to do a somersault in the air. If it fails to do so, it will be rejected. If an eagle or any other bird attacks the pigeon they are allowed a substitute. It should fly solo. If it flies with another pigeon then it will be rejected. No flags, or clothes should create hindrance to the birds. Every hour the Shokhdhar should show his bird to the referee. If it rains and the tournament is interrupted then a rematch will be organised on an other day. If the bird perches itself anywhere.. other than the designated place.. ..It will be rejected. If it’s too dark while the bird lands we could arrange for lights. Shikara! Pigeons are not the only ones in the sky, there’s Shikara too. Shikara was brought to avoid birds in the airport runway. Everybody tames pigeons, he tamed the one that killed pigeons. Guess what I’ve got for you. Pigeon meat. I’ll savour chicken, You eat the pigeon. Take! Have fun. Check the time. Shikara’s bird has flown for over 11 hours to claim the first spot. What happend to you? I thought you will fly the whole night. But it’s okay. I'm sure you will win. Make him drink water. Cancel all the lights too. Okay sir. Brother! It’s been 4 hours. Brother. It’s still flying. You must have felt like a prisoner all this while. Go have some pigeon meat. Enjoy. Brother eagle! Amma! Amma! There is some connection between the bird and the Shikara. Why is there a cage in his car? Brother! Hampa’s pigeon is dead. Which one? Amma pigeon? Yes. Is anybody participating on his behalf? You should participate on my behalf. How can I do it? You’ve always wanted to do it. You have the zeal to do it too. Let’s do it together. From Yajaman’s clan, Winnie is contesting with the bird named Bookie. I request you all to encourage them. Bless me. All the best. Here. Take it. Pass the cigarette. Show the bird. Coming sir. It’s there.. Towards your left. The bird has been flying since 6 hours and 7 minutes. Brother! What happened? It came down. How many hours did it fly? The bird was in the air For 11 hours 7 minutes. We won right? Among 8 competitors The leading bird is Shikara. Our pigeon lost by 15 minutes. It’s okay. How will the bird know, If it knew then it would have flown more. Hampa has named a substitute for his pigeon. Is Kalki here? No he is in the tournament. The substitute pigeon is the last entrant in this tournament. That’s Kalki’s bike. These days he doesn’t have time to meet us. No bird remembers its nest when it learns to fly. What are you doing? Didn’t I ask you not to bring weapons to temples? All the best! Looking for an auspicious time? Yes. You know what happened to my pigeon right? So thought I’ll take God’s blessings before I enter the tournament again. Do you think Kalki will pull this off? Yes. This pigeon has taken a liking towards him too. Everybody thinks I’m angry about this. He hasn’t even told me about it. I know why he chose not to tell it to me. He likes to enter this tournament. But fears that I will not allow that. And he will never do anything against my will. Everybody says Kalki is like my son. I dont have children. He is not like my son. Kalki. He is my son. He has to win. His dreams should be fulfilled. He should become a big Shokhdar. Where is he? I want to cry in your arms. But you might think I’m acting. Your place is in my heart. Not at my feet. Pari. Our lives are entwined. If you fly I live, if you die, I die. Jai Anjaneya! Bro, eagle is here. What happened? It’s still in the air brother. Your enemy is still alive, Kill him. Come back soon, I’ll feed you well. I cannot witness this. What happened? It was a narrow escape. Brother! What happend? Pigeon is playing around with our bird. What? This was bound to happen. Shikara is dead. Shikara! My Shikara! They’ve tied blade to the pigeons legs. What a game this was! This is the first time I’ve seen a pigeon kill an eagle. This is your first tournament right? You’ve trained your pigeon well. You became No 1 Shokhdar. Can’t this tournament be held without bloodshed? How dare you tie a blade to pigeon’s legs? I’ll teach you guys a lesson. How dare you cheat me? How dare you tie blade to pigeon’s legs? Do I look like a fool to you? Everybody ties ring to pigeons legs. I’ve tied a blade. Moreover, I didn’t kill a pigeon. I killed an eagle. Who are you? The one who tames snakes is called a snake charmer. The one who tames elephants is called a Mahout. The who performs magic tricks is called a magician. But the one who tears an opponent apart is a ‘Kannadiga’. Yajaman is here. I am letting go because police is here. I would have sliced you like how my eagle was sliced. Don’t get into fights here we don’t have permission for race. Get the pigeon down. You saved my life Pari. This happiness must be celebrated. Come let’s party. Be careful! Easy, Easy Tiger! Congratulations. Looks like the Shokhdhar has arrived. Everybody has been speaking about you. Why don’t you propose that girl again? Jumanji! A pigeon has to be free. And a girl has to be with somebody who takes care of her, not wants her. Don’t ask again. Just 200 rupees. Pay the previous balance. I will give everything tomorrow. You change your words like a chameleon changes colors. I’ll pay it tomorrow. Don't ask me. You can never be trusted. Please give. What are you doing here? I had to go to hospital to give blood, hence was asking money. But they don’t take blood from a person who is intoxicated, right? My friend has met with an accident. And he was drunk. Because I’ve drank too, they will match his blood and mine. Come let’s go to hospital. Come let’s go to a pub. What are you searching for? Materials to hit you. Miss Pari. I’ve got a gift for you, Don’t come behind me again. Dad! Dad! Dad! What happend? Dad! How are you feeling? Why have you called the nurse? She is a student, and has come for practical studies. It helps them and us. I would have helped him. They gave this wheelchair too. Oh this would be expensive for us. Pari! I want to step out. Why? For... How will you go out like this? Wait I’ll come. Nobody trusts me. I am a useless man. Even my wife left me. I’m a useless person. What happened dad? Why you speaking like this? Its been a long time since you stepped out. Should I get you some drinks? What happened? Why are you crying? Is it paining? Yes. But it’s my heart that pains. I haven’t done anything nice for you from your childhood till now. Why are you speaking about all this? Aren’t you ashamed of me? Haven’t you felt like getting rid of me? We don’t stop praying because bad things happen to us right? You are my god. It’s time for tears and smiles to meet. I’m sorry. I think I came at the wrong time. No No! Please sit. How are you feeling now? I’m okay. It looks like you’ve gotten along like rum and coke. Why talk about rum now. You both talk, I’ll prepare coffee. I’ll make it. No, it’s okay sit. Pari! Falls work for this will be more. Please make it soon. I had proposed to you. But you said I won’t suit your lifestyle. Match this colour to the borders. If I had listened to my heart. I would have gotten a lot of girls. But, I listened to my mind. It is pointing only at you. Please accept my proposal soon. I mean finish this work soon. I’ll leave. Have coffee and go. I’ll keep visiting anyway. I want to talk with you personally, will meet you soon. Dad, Here drink this. Parmi! Your friend Kalki has broken my father’s legs. What was my dad's fault? My dad is like a child. How inhumane is Kalki? He will never prosper in life. Shut up! If a school bell rings in the morning it brings in sadness. But the same bell when it rings in the evening it brings happiness. Our Kalki is also like that. A sound that brings pain to him but happiness to others. How do you justify this? He has done the right thing. It took a broken leg to make your dad sit at home. You must be around 22 years now. Right? All your life your father hadn’t seen your pain or tears or the struggles. Why do you think he can see it now? This was the only way he had to help you. Your dad, who strut around drunk is a good man. But Kalki, made him sit at home, yet he’s a bad person. Who do you think is sending the nurse to your home? Kalki! Kalki! Rowdyism is a tricky thing. You can’t step out of it easily. I don’t think there’s any other option now. I hit people for pigeons. I made them fear me. I killed Mani. After killing Shaukat Ali. I wanted to leave all this But I fired on the dope gang for you. Now this Shikara. This will never end. I should leave it all behind. A soldier leaves his life. Not war. Get up. Do you think you’re a soldier. Get to Tumkur and look after the quarry from tomorrow. You liked a girl right? I’ll get you married to her. Call that girl. It is okay. I will speak to her. She will get scared if she hears your voice. If you don’t like her let us know right away. Don’t say otherwise later. When have I said no to him? Yeah right! Tomorrow I’ll go the temple and then meet the girl. There’s a good news in town. What is it? That you and Kalki will marry eachother. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Your thoughts have now engulfed me. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Your thoughts have now engulfed me. Without you around dark clouds hover over me. With you by my side, it feels like sunshine again. Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! I feel newer things. Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! What does this signify? Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! You’re my inspiration. Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! There’s nothing to worry now. My love is bundled will you buy it love? I wait for you, in this crowded place. I shall pay upfront, for everything you have to offer. It doesn’t matter, if it’s more than what I could afford. I lose my mind, everytime you smile. Everytime I yearn for you is a celebration. I don’t know what’s happening to me. My eyes look for you, even while you’re away. Without you around dark clouds hover over me. With you by my side, it feels like sunshine again. Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! I feel newer things. Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! What does this signify? Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! You’re my inspiration. Oh Beloved! Oh Beloved! There’s nothing to worry now. Hello! Yajaman is dead. Stop blabbering and cut the call. Cut the call. Yajaman was killed. What are you saying? I can’t see him like this. He left us alone in this bad world. Why did you let him go alone? You don’t deserve all this. A rowdy’s wife is always a widow. Please leave, I beg you. This is not for you. Please leave. Please leave. Why did you come here? Juice? I don’t drink juice. Please take. Please take. This is my daughter Pari. Parijata. She is named after the flower. Her heart is as tender as the flower. You don’t worry. We shall nurture it well. What is all this? One minute. Pari! Please listen to your mum. Follow your mind. Why have they come here? They’ve brought a marriage proposal. That guy loves you dearly. What about me? Shouldn’t I feel the same too? Will you marry the guy you love? Listen Pari! He’s a frog under knife. His life is always under somebody’s mercy. This guy is educated, and is intelligent. He will keep you very happy. But I don’t like.. Please don’t say no.. All my life I’ve been reckless. For the first time in my life. I’m being responsible. A responsible father. Please don’t deprive me of this opportunity. I beg you. What are you doing? I’m getting married. Married Life Happy! What’s your final decision? If there’s a non veg buffet, I’ll come, If it’s veg then I won’t. Pari! Don’t stay with someone who has no emotions left. My dreams are now dead. There’s nothing left here anymore. God has bestowed the worst of his curses on me. Darkness has engulfed life mocking the light that’s left. Sir, Is this Ramchandrappa’s son? It’s all my fault. I should’ve taken care of them. You wouldn’t do it. It’s good that he died. Please don’t say it. Stop crying. Would you take care of them, if they were alive? I would. But they aren’t there anymore. God doesn’t give chances. I didn’t even get one. But you’re getting it. Your father stays with me. This house is always in dark. Mom, I need water. Mom! The hands that encouraged now lay lifeless. The one who sheltered now stays away. There’s nobody left to wipe tears of a hurt soul. God has bestowed the worst of his curses on me. Darkness has engulfed life mocking the light that’s left. Sir. Why have you called them here? An enemy’s enemy is a friend. That Yajamana insulted me a lot. These people have killed him. We wanted to meet you, Brother. We wanted to kill Yajamana. It’s good that you killed him. Next you have to kill Kalki. Till date it was Sherva. Now Shikara is taking his place. We have no need to work for anybody. We will have no respect if we continue working for others. If Shikara kills Kalki. He will rule this market. If we have to rule this market We should be the one killing him. Namaste Brother! Sit down. Bro! Did you see Pari? No. I searched everywhere but couldn’t find her. You wont find her. I know she won’t come back. It’s because I let Parijatha go, Pari also decided to let me go. I sent my parents too. Even Yajamana left. I am an orphan I don’t have anybody left. Don't say such things brother. I shouldn’t live anymore. I want to die. The ones who killed Yajaman are still alive. You should kill them. It’s so tasty. Where did you get it from. It’s really nice. I need another serving. I know you’ve called me here to get me killed You should come home for this festival Don’t miss. Don’t miss it. Look at us too. Serve my friends over there. Coming brother. How’s the food? Do you need anything else? Kalki! Beer? Chef has done a great job. This is how weekends should be. This looks so tasty brother. What’s happening? There’s a fight going on. Leave me please! I haven’t done anything. You should have thought about it when you killed Yajaman. I didn’t kill him. Dope gang killed Yajaman. Please leave me. Pull him inside. Why did you kill Shikara? I just saw that Kalki is still alive. How is he now? He is half dead. He must have fallen there. Why did you kill Shikara? Lets face it. We will Kalki as well. A pigeon should always be free. It should be with the ones who love it, than the ones who have it. I didn’t understand. I loved her for namesake. But there’s somebody else who has loved her truly. What are you saying? He’s a fashion designer, Apparently, he loves her a lot. Are you waiting for someone? Someone important had to come. He’s nowhere to be seen. It’s already late. He’s the reason behind our marriage. I don’t know if he is your friend or an enemy. He asked me not to tell you about him. He showed me the way to win your heart. He showed that mind is greater that heart. He finally got me to you. Why are you crying? A guy may quit smoking or drinking for love. But, have you seen a guy who sacrifices his love? If I marry him. I’ll feel bad for having to let you go. But if I marry you. I’ll never be able to live at all. I can’t do it. Pari! If you marry him, don’t think about me. Even if you do, don’t think I’ll be sad. Because If you’re happy. I’ll be happy too. All the best! Take care. Where is the fair around here? Pari! What are you doing here? What about your marriage? Forget all that Where is Kalki? Your time’s up. I’ve waited for this opportunity since forever now. Kill him! One! Two! Three! You could be the fourth! But then.. You saved a bullet! Rest in peace. Sir! Family Drama! Send this to post mortem I’ll speak to the officials! Kalki! Kalki was a nice guy. He shouldn’t have died. Please wake up. Your Pari is here Kalki. Kalki! Please wake up. I’ve always thought about you. But you left without a thought. Why should I be alive? Kalki please wake up. Pari! Pinji! Kalki! Your Pari is here. Pari! Please don’t leave me ever again. I can’t stay without you.
