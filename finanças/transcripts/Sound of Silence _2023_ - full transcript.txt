Um, I forgot I had it. It's great, isn't it? Great at taking up space and collecting dust. Like that clock and everything else in here. [sighs] Dinner in 15. -Mmm-hmm. -[woman mocks him] "Mmm-hmm."

Yo, it's your boy Ja' Ma the Great just checking in. I know we had a long weekend, but... woo! The sun is shining from where I am. Let's just bring the good energy into this Monday, you know? [slow strumming] Emma? I'm sorry. Right on time. [chuckles] What happened? Nothing. I panicked again. Yeah. Was he the same creepy judge from last time? Yeah. He must think I'm mute by now. Emma. Your voice is incredible. ♪ When they ♪ ♪ Finally do ♪ -♪ Get to hear it ♪ -[chuckles] They'll love it. [cellphone ringing] Hi, Mom. Wait, what? Yeah, okay. I'll call you back. I'm leaving tonight. What happened? I need to go back to Italy. Italy? [tense music] [footsteps approaching] Coming with you. [sighs] [he sighs] All right. Italy, here we come. All right. Here we are. [melancholic piano music] Mom. Emma. [sighs] -Hello, Seba. -Hi, Miss Wilson. [in Italian] [in English] I don't know. They told me to wait here. I'll be right back. [man speaking Italian] [woman speaking Italian] [in Italian] [man and woman quietly speaking Italian] -Is everything okay? -I don't know yet. Your father is in intensive care. He's stable for now, but we have to keep a close eye on him. Intensive care? He suffered a concussion, which caused a blood clot to form in his brain. And he also has a few broken ribs. Can I see him? Not yet, but I'll let you in as soon as I can. Is he gonna be okay? We are treating him with anticoagulants. We have to wait and see how he responds to the medication. Otherwise he'll need surgery. Have you discussed what happened with your mother? No. I mean, not yet. Your mother has bruises on her neck, arms, and face. What are you saying? Your mother's wounds are defensive. And victims of marital abuse often protect their abuser. Miss... Talk to her. She pushed him... down the stairs. I would keep her one more night under observation. I'll wait in there. [Emma] Mom. Dad has had a concussion. He's in ICU, but he's stable now. A concussion? They wanna keep you in observation tonight, too. It's just a precaution, okay? Emma-- You don't have to explain anything right now. -I just want you to be okay. -[sighs] [in Italian] He tried to kill me, but it wasn't your father. We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? I'll go home and pick you up in the morning. No, you can't go home! No! Fine, I'll book a hotel. Take my car, it's parked downstairs. Please, don't go home. Please! Hey. I'll book a hotel. No. We're going to my house. [tense music] [in Italian] Scopa! [alarm goes off] [long beep, alarm turns off] [Emma] We need to fix this alarm. It goes off for no reason. So... This is where the future Ariana Grande was born, huh? [chuckles] Come, I'll show you something. [Seba] So this was your little secret getaway? Yeah. [chuckles] I've spent so many hours in here, singing and playing. My parents built this studio so that I could scream all I wanted. And now they're cheering for you? Yeah. I sang with him for the first time in here. My dad. We wrote so many songs together. Hey. You want me to sing? Please don't. [both chuckle] [footsteps approaching] Wow! [chuckles] This is my dad's secret place. There is a lot of very weird stuff in here. Weird and old and broken. He loves fixing this stuff. Hey. Everything is gonna be fine. I just can't believe my dad would hurt my mom. What about I make you some dinner? Hmm? I'm just gonna stay here a little longer, okay? Sure. Um... I'll be downstairs. Okay. [click, radio interference] [guitar solo plays] What happened to you, Dad? [interference interrupts music] [Seba] Um, Emma! We have a situation here. Um... Definitely can't eat that. There is the food truck we saw before. Okay, how about this? I'll go, you stay here. Seba, no one speaks English here. I think I can handle it. Okay. Take the car. No, I'll walk. In case your mom calls. I have an idea. [sighs] It's my mom's. Does it work? I mean, she uses it everyday.
