It's so cold. What's with that kid? What are you doing? Who are you calling a kid? Hey, kid! Knock it off! Bro, he's crying- Kid... What did you say? What's going on with you? Do you want to find out? Boss... Your letter. Do you want me to hold on to it? Isn't it from your sister? It'll get wrinkled if you get into a fight. Never mind! Boss... You kid! Boss! Slop! Kill him! Boss! THREE YEARS LATER Bro! It's been a while. Thank you for sewing your time. How's everything? It's not that great. We need you around. We want to do something good, but the boys don't listen to any of us. We were waiting for you. Let's get at it! It's nice to be out. The air is so clean. Shall we get you a girl next? Let's go. &lt;i&gt;1 have money.&lt;/i&gt; I'm sorry! What are you doing? She took my money! I don't care! She's still a child! Get out of here! Are you all right? Are you hurt? You shouldn't steal. But, I'm so hungry. Do you want some? Fool! Where's your wallet? But! Be quiet! Get something to eat. Don't pickpocket anymore. You're so kind. Can you take care of me, too? I like you. Shall we go? That was fast. Welcome! Three? Are you staying the night or short stay? We're staying over. 1000 yen per person. You want payment up front? I have a lot of people who leave without paying. I'm running a business here. Ca" You pay him? What happened? &lt;i&gt;1 don't have enough.&lt;/i&gt; We came this far... It's that kid. There's enough here for you. Fool! How can I leave you out here? What are you saying? You haven't had any in a while. Idiot! The three of us are a band of brothers. I can't have a good time alone. You're making a scene. You're interfering with my business. Get out of here! All right! Let's go! Wait! I'll pay. But... I fell in love with you. Can you put it on my tab? Fool! What are you saying? Don't we bring you a lot of business? What? Don't be ridiculous! How dare you take us for fools, you foreigner! What? Get him up! I'll kill you the next time you hit a woman! What happened? I'm taking your money. Ryo, get the money. I sot it! Get in! Let's go! See you later! How dare you come here! Just kill them all. Give us the money. What shall we do? We can't win against a gun. Give them the money back. All right. We got it. Hey": It's been a while. Good timing. Let's talk later. Don't move! See you later. What happened to your sister? Were you able to see her? I went to the address that she wrote on the letter, but she wasn't there. I don't know where she is. I'm sure she's selling herself somewhere, after all, she is your sister. How dare you say that about my sister! That's right. Give that to me. Give you what? The money. What? I was there first. What are you talking about? We saved your lives! That's right! No one asked you to. Do you really think you can shoot someone with this? Give me the money. Be quiet! Now you're making me mad. Just calm down and give me the money. It's for your own good. Don't make me laugh. Shall we settle what we couldn't settle in prison? You're on. Don't butt in! Ryo, are you all right? I'm fine. It's nothing. This is not good. They'll surround us if we take too long. All right, I'll take care of this, so take Ryo and get him some help. What about you? I won't let them get me. But, Bro... Go... You come with us, too. Me? That's right. Bro, please be careful. Dam... I don't have any more bullets. I guess I'll have to prepare to die. We're surrendering! We lose! You finally fell for our trap. This is what you get for taking us for fools. Kill them all! Wait a minute! Kanzaki... I see you're all here... Yes, we had a little trouble here. What brings you here? I just got out of prison and need to talk to those two. They were in there with me. I'm sure you have your battles with them, but would you allow me to take them with me? But, they're... I'm asking you. There's no need to hesitate... It's been a while. Toyokai is not what it used to be. If you ever go against us again we'll kill you all. I threw my life away once already, so go ahead. Wait a minute. What? Owaku Group? I have the Toyokai's support. You don't scare me at all! I understand... Mr. Kanzaki... Are they still at it? They have the military supporting them. Bro... when did you get out? Yesterday. I went to my mother's grave and happened to hear about you. You saved our lives. Thank you. I'm going to have the two of you leave this port town. That was the promise I made to them when I asked for you. That's the way it goes. So we're being chased out. That has nothing to do with us. I'll kill you both if you don't want to agree to this. &lt;i&gt;I am a yakuza, you know.&lt;/i&gt; Don't underestimate us. You'll be killed eventually. I guess we have to say goodbye to this port. We'll leave as a thanks to you for saving our lives. I was born and raised here. I was planning to die here. How about it? Do you want to go against the Toyokai if you're going to throw your lives away anyway? Toyokai? Do you know the Matsui group? I heard they were shut down by the Toyokai after getting into a huge fight with them. &lt;i&gt;I risked my life tor that fight, butt was sent away and&lt;/i&gt; let them kill my boss. The Osaka Owaku Group came in to mediate and the Matsui group name was the only thing that was saved. The Toyokai are rising up like the sunrise now. The police can't seem to put a hold on them. What does that have to do with us? You can't be rebels forever. How about it? I liked your courage that I saw when I was in prison with the two of you. What are you going to do? &lt;i&gt;I want to go with you, but 1 have somewhere 1 neet! to go.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Masa!&lt;/i&gt; Bro! Thank you! What are you doing? Come inside! Thank you for looking after my mother while I was gone. What are you saying? We're not strangers. Did you go to her grave? Thank you for the nice grave. I wasn't able to do anything good for her while she was alive. I'm so glad I have you. Fool! Is that what you came here to tell me? Masa... I hope you're not planning to... I thought so. I'm sorry. I've caused you so much trouble and I can't even pay you back. &lt;i&gt;Don't worry about it.&lt;/i&gt; I hope you're not planning to risk your life again. I have to do it for our boss who lost his life... I understand how you feel. Masa, we're blood brothers. I'll do anything for you. Don't hesitate to ask. I'm grateful for your words. WELCOME TO BEPPU This is incredible. Come here! It's red... This is it. He's still the different guy he always was. Different? Sending guys like you over... It's all right. Make yourselves at home. May we go out to play? It's a little different, but... &lt;i&gt;Don't worry about that. Thank you.&lt;/i&gt; I'm sorry. Show them their rooms. Where are you going? This is a town full of hot springs. So? You call yourself a man? Danshich What? How are you going to pay for this? We just let Matsui wony about that. We didn't come here to play. This is different. Let's have fun. All right. I don't care what happens. Bring us some sake! Let's dance. Again; &lt;i&gt;Why not?&lt;/i&gt; Let's go to the other room. Where? To bed. What are you saying? It's still broad daylight. What does that have to do with anything? I said no. Don't say that. No! Please. No! Come inside. You push, push and push again... to get the cute girl you want. What do you think? Hum!- You sure have a lot on. Come on... Danshich Don't peek! Do what you want! I'm leaving. He left. Who cares about him. Hey! You're still here? Excuse me... We have much better girls than this geisha. I don't care! I don't deed two! How about her? Stop joking around! Are you going against the Toyokai? Toyokai? What are you saying? Brother... Brother... Sumiko. You're... Sumiko! What are you doing here? Sumiko... Is she your sister? This is interesting. Stay out of it! Sumiko... Brother... I... Be quiet! My sister is pure and innocent... You're not my sister! Hey! Come with us. Brother... Don't move! You're such a handful. Please allow me to introduce myself. Forgive me for bringing my son. I apologize to the boss, his wife and others... I was born in Joshu... &lt;i&gt;1 have no parents.&lt;/i&gt; Dad, I'm cold. My name is Yujiro Jinno. All right. That's enough. Bring your son in. He has a high fever. Call a doctor. Get some ice. Thank you. Don't mention it. I'll have my boys watch him, so go on to bed. Are you a guest? I'm sorry for not introducing myself. Nice to meet you. Same here. I'm Danshichi. This is Tatsu. Nice to meet you. Excuse me for asking, but whose ashes are those? His mother. So your wife? Yes. I've made her suffer so much and wanted to at least bury her in her hometown. Then he got sick on the way there. I see. Yukichi... Get well... How is he? He seems to be doing better. That's good. I don't know what would have happened if you didn't help us. I'll do that. &lt;i&gt;Don't worry about it.&lt;/i&gt; His fever went down. You must be tired. No. You must be tired, too. Please get some rest. He's so cute. You never want to show your family your weak side, but this may be a good time to cut your ties with this kind of business. Of course, I'm in no position to tell you what to do. When Japan lost the war, everything changed for us. I have people's livelihood': at stake, so I have no idea what my future holds. You're lucky you only have your son to think about. Dad... Where's your boss? One moment please. Boss! Nice to see all of you. You have two men staying with you, don't you? Two men? Hey! Get up! I see... A girl. Why don't you just hand them over to us if you understand our situation. What's the matter? &lt;i&gt;1 hope you're not going to say no.&lt;/i&gt; They are our guests. I'll take care of whatever problems they have caused. The Toyokai will take care of them. Make up your mind whether you're going to hand them over to us or not! Our guests are not products! It is our policy to take care of them while they are staying with us. I'm sure you know that. We have our own plans if you don't want to hand them over to us. This means war. Hey! How dare you make up those lies! Stop it. Please don't worry. We can't cause you any trouble. Thank you for your hospitality. So you're the boss. It's them. You look like a blind boss. You sure are fools to come to this town and go against the Toyokai. I can see why Japan lost the war. Don't make me laugh. Japan may have lost the war, but we didn't lose anything to you. Your nose? Your ear? Or, both hands and feet? So? Do you understand what you're up against now? This is nothing! How dare you underestimate the Japanese! I've been pissed off since last night! Ouch... Hey": You're alive? Of course. I wouldn't let some lowlifes like them take my life. What should we do? About what? We can't go back to the Matsui group since we would cause them trouble. But I don't feel like going back with things like this. You're right. I want to leave this town, but... There's a reason I can't leave even if I wanted to. What is it? Let's find some place to rest. Are you all right? You don't have your usual energy. &lt;i&gt;Don't worry about me.&lt;/i&gt; Shall we go? I'm sorry, but we don't have any rooms. What? No rooms? Yes. I'm sorry. What are you saying? How can all of your rooms be taken. Please do us this favor... What do you mean? HEY, you two... You're such fools. Fools? Who are you? Are you planning to cause trouble for this inn after having a run-in with the Toyokai? Trouble? The Toyokai watches over the Association of Inns. Think about what would happen to them if they were to let you stay. You're such idiots. What did you just say? I'll say it again! You idiots! You're such a fool... Let's go. Damn! That was one fine woman. The woman? Where are we going to stay? That's right. We'll find something. Hey": What? &lt;i&gt;I see you have no time hr a woman, bu“ can&lt;/i&gt; take care of your injuries. Really? There's a vacant house next to my house. A vacant house? I didn't want to smear mud in your face, so I spared them, but I'll make sure you pay for it if they do that again. I understand. It's as my brother says... Get those two out of here. I can't do that. Are you going to defy the chairman? Those two are guests of mine that were sent to me by someone I'm obligated to. I can't just chase them out. You sure have a lot of guts. Do you want to go against the Toyokai again? I don't want any trouble, but... &lt;i&gt;Then just do as 1 say!&lt;/i&gt; Or I'll chase your entire group out of this town. Well? I'm the third generation boss of the Matsui group. I'm not taking orders from you. Now we have a reason to go after them. That fool. What happened? What did they tell you? There may be a war. Are we going to finally do it? It depends on what Toyokai decides to do. Just be ready. Boss! Boss! Hurry! I'm sorry for my late arrival. &lt;i&gt;1 had no idea what was going on.&lt;/i&gt; This is all my fault for sending you those two idiots. It's not their fault. There's no reasoning with the Toyokai. I knew this would happen sooner or later. I was worried about that, too, so I thought they could help you in some way. But, this is just the opposite of what my intentions were to pay back my obligations to the late boss. No... you paid your dues by doing your time in prison. The Matsui group was saved because of you. Please don't overextend yourself. My guest... This is Yujiro Jinno. This guest saved my life. I see. I'm sonyl didn't introduce myself earlier. I'm Masakichi Kanzaki. I'm Jinno. How is your son? He's much better. Thank you very much. He must be lonely. Go and tend to him. Thank you. Please take care. He's with his son? He just lost his wife. I can't let him get involved in this. &lt;i&gt;1 hope he haves soon.&lt;/i&gt; My gut tells me he's not the type to leave after he saw what happened. I'd like him to stay, but we may end up making his son suffer. Masakichi, could you do me a favor? Yukichi... This is from Boss Matsui for your late wife. Yujiro, we don't want you to feel as though you need to repay your obligations more than you already have. Thank you, but I'm in the same business... We appreciate your thoughts, but to tell you the truth, you're more trouble than help. Trouble? It's hard for me to say this, but it will only make things worse with the Toyokai if we have you stay. Please understand... I'm sorry for crossing the line. Thank you. Don't worry. I don't have anything better to do anyway. How can a beautiful woman like you not be busy? We just got word that all geisha are not allowed in the inns. What's that about? Did the Toyokai put that order out? This is much better than having them take all of my money and work me to the bones. &lt;i&gt;You're right! 1 knew you were a smart woman.&lt;/i&gt; This is no time to be impressed. We didn't decide to stay here just for fun. I know that. This way please. Masa... You sure found a nice place to stay. You forgot this. This nice lady asked us to be her bodyguard. I don't know why, but I always find myself around women and fights. She sure is cute. Do you want to many me when you get older? Ouch. Stop that! Boss Matsui was attacked. What? How is he? He's going to live. I hope it's not our fault... Of course it is. Now that you know that, I don't want you to cause any more trouble for the Matsui group! I thought you could help them, but I sure read you wrong. Behave for a while. Where are you going? To the Matsui house. We're coming with you. It'll be a war if they see you going in that house. But, they're not going to just back down. We need to make amends. They're the Toyokai. The Matsui group is no match for them right now. I'll give you a call once everything settles down. Masa, are you a member of the Matsui group? No. Then why are you working so hard to help them? This is a while back, but... ...I fell in love with a prostitute. I was able to get her out of the business, but she got very ill and the late Boss Matsui helped her when we had lost all hope. Oko! Masa, I'm so happy... I can die a normal person. It's as if I'm dreaming. And... ...I'm in such a huge hospital... Boss, thank you very much. She told me many times to never forget what the boss did for her before she died. I would never let anything happen to that group as long as I'm alive. You sure take your obligations seriously. If you forget your obligations, you can forget about being a part of this world. Obligation... Let's do it. Do what? Get revenge for Boss Matsui, of course. We have to pay our obligations. What do you say? You're right. Shall we go? Stop it. Didn't he just tell you to behave for a while? Stay out of this! Wait! What? What? Be careful. When did you two... You womanizer... Please make some money... Mr. Mikuniya... What's the matter? I'll be leaving now... Now, now... The vice chain-nan is here tonight, too. But, I don't have any more money. We can lend you some. 3 million for Mr. Mikuniya. No! Don't hold back. We trust you. That's too much. Those two? You rats... You came out of your hole? We came here for you. I thought it was you. You're from that brothel house. The Toyokai is everywhere! You were the fool who underestimated us. I'll take care of him. Where's the bathroom? There is no bathroom! Don't be ridiculous. I can't hold it! Don't move! You sure gave us hell yesterday, but we won't let you do that today. Do you want me to fire one at you? We're ready to risk our lives. One move and I'll blast you to pieces. Settle down! Excuse us for interrupting your fun. Throw down your weapons! Can't you see this? I knew it was all set up. Take all of your money and leave. Take it! Don't move! We won't let you get away with this. Do you understand? And about the geisha... I don't know about picking on the weak women. That's right. You won't ban them from the inns in the future. All right? Yes. We can't trust you. We want you to apologize to them. Send SOMEONE OVGI'. Don't any of you move. What's that look... Do you sincerely feel bad? Why don't you look like you do if you really are? I'm not going to let you go until we settle all of this. I'm hungry- I am, too. Brother... Sumiko. You two should back down now. That's dirty! Let him go or I'll kill your sister. Your sister? &lt;i&gt;1 don't care what happens to me!&lt;/i&gt; You fool! How could I let them kill you. Brother... Let her go... Or you don't care what happens to him? You let him go then we'll let her go. We won't let her go until then. All right, let's do the exchange. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. So this is the reason why you couldn't leave this town. I have some business with his sister, too. Don't come here! Let her go! You first! All right, but try anything funny and I'll blow this up! Take her! Don't move! Or do you want to be blown to pieces? Go on! Thanks! Don't move! Go! Sumiko! Are you all right? How dare you make more trouble again! How is she? Bro! Oh, it's you... What kind of greeting is that? We came right away when we heard what was happening? How could you just leave us? Why didn't you tell us if you were coming down here to fight? Be quiet! We have a patient here! Thank you. Brother... You don't have to thank me. I... ...didn't want you... ...to see me like this. But... &lt;i&gt;“.1 wanted to see you.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;1 wanted to see you, too.&lt;/i&gt; I'm sorry for hitting you. I... ...was happy that you hit me. You... ...are definitely my brother. Sumiko... Please don't cry. It's not like you. I was waiting... ...ever since that day. But... ...I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again. Let's talk when you get better. Just rest. Yes, but... I was able to see you. I'm so hiPPY- Sumiko! You fool... Tatsu, I have a favor to ask of you. What is it? Please make me your blood brother. &lt;i&gt;No way. 1 don't take anyone under me.&lt;/i&gt; That's not true. You're the man that my sister fell in love with. Sumiko and I only had each other since we were little. We went through a lot of hardships. She would cry when she was hungry. I was still little, but I couldn't bear to hear her cry. &lt;i&gt;So, 1 wanted her to be happy.&lt;/i&gt; Tatsu... If we become brothers, it would make her happy. I was always hungry when I was little, too. I don't remember what my late father looked like, but just the thought of my stepfather makes me angry. He would always hit me for every little thing. I couldn't even ask for seconds at mealtime... We're so alike. We were like brothers since we were little. Please grant me this favor. Tatsu, why don't you agree? But... We can't tum back now. We don't even know if we'll be able to live through tomon'ow. We're going to live and die together. That's what I've decided. Well said. &lt;i&gt;Now 1 know 1 was fight about you.&lt;/i&gt; I have a blood brother, too, but I'm one that can't stay in one place for too long. I go wherever I want, but I realize that I can't do much by myself when I'm up against a wall. I didn't want the both of you to go through what I did. I thought you could help each other out. Let's do it. Shall we go to the other side together while we're at it? Thank you. To tell you the truth... I was planning to live life lightheartedly... But, a wrong tum brought me somewhere unexpected... Masa... We don't know what'll happen to us now that we're going up against the Toyokai. We ask for your support. Your guest humiliated the vice chainnan. You need to take responsibility for that! Don't make me laugh! Boss! What? The Boss? The Toyokai attacked us just now! How dare they... Let's get them! Bro! They're here! I came here to relay a message from our boss. Listen well. Be quiet! What is it? Stop this nonsense and sumander. We'll bum this geisha town down if you don't want to obey. We don't care what happens to the women and children. What? And you call yourselves human? What's wrong with paying you back for all the trouble your people caused on the mainland? We won't let you leave. We'll give you until sunset, so think about it. Don't move! How dare they! Hitting our weak spot... This isn't the first time... What should we do? We can't involve the commoners. So are we going to just do as they say? No way! Idiot! The women and children are at risk here. Shall we make a run for it? Don't wony about us? Don't let them win. But... Listen to us. We've been listening to them all of these years. We had given up since we lost the war and thought we couldn't go against the country that won the war. But, we have no hope anymore. We'll risk our lives to fight them. &lt;i&gt;So, phase don't worry about us.&lt;/i&gt; Even if you leave, it doesn't guarantee our safety. I would rather die than be used by them. Thank you for saying that. We feel better hearing that. Let's scratch the idea to make a run for it. All right! Let's do it! It's a war! Who are you? Owaku. Owaku? From Osaka? Where are you going? I'm going to see my brother. Can you get out of my way? Why don't they just come here? Don't rush into it. &lt;i&gt;Fight. om?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;1 hate you.&lt;/i&gt; We have to say bye soon. You take care of yourself. Brother, someone is coming. Brother... Masa... Whv are you here? Who is this? He's the boss of the Owaku group in Osaka. I guess you're finally going to do it. I'm going to join in on this. No. What will happen to the Owaku group if you do this? Masa, I'm not doing this as the boss of the Owaku group. I'm doing this as your brother. I appreciate your offer, but these are my troubles. Please let me do this on my own. You won't be able to win with only these men. I know that. You idiot! Do you want to die that badly? &lt;i&gt;Do you think 1 can watch you die?&lt;/i&gt; Please hear me out. I know you've probably heard this already, but the Matsui group is gone. I'm the cause of it. I can't apologize enough to the late Boss Matsui. I don't want to borrow anyone's help for this. I want to settle this on my own. Masa... You're such a... Brother, I just have one favor. What brings the boss of the Owaku group all the way here? What is this about? I have a favor to ask of you. I refuse to back down. I'd like you to let me take the people of this town. The geisha went against the Toyokai. They deserve whatever happens to them. But... ...you don't have to hurt the women and children. I won't take any orders from you! Get out of here while it's still lighted. &lt;i&gt;'Fan, your brother 'rs going against you.&lt;/i&gt; I don't mind having my group back him up. That's great! We'll take you on anytime! I'll never let you go home alive. I see. Go ahead. But I'll never let you touch those women and children! This is Japan! Don't forget that! What are you going to do? All right. I'll let you have your way. But we have conditions, too. What are they? Can you promise your group will never get involved in this situation? That's fine. Thanks. What's the story with this kimono? My late mom sewed it for me. She was looking forward to the two of us living together, but I couldn't grant her wish. Bro! How did it go? Our boss will take care of the commoners. Please bring them to the bridge within the hour. The boss is waiting there. I'm surprised the Toyokai agreed to it. It wasn't much of a problem. The boss will take full responsibility. He risked his life for this. Obana, I'm sure you heard what he just said. Please have everyone get their things together. What shall we do? I'll see them off. I'll go with you. Me, too. No, it'll cause a ruckus if too many of us go. Especially if it's you two. It should just be me. That's not good. They would never let you come back alive. My brother is risking his life out there and waiting for me. I have to go by myself. But, you may lose your life. Nothing would make me happier. Now I can face the late boss. I'll be able to see you guys on the other side sooner or later. Let's have a toast to our brotherhood before we make our crossing to the other side. What do you say? Is everyone here? They're waiting for you on the other side. Brother, it's almost time. Let's all go. Please come back alive. At the crossing, I guess... Damn, he's getting all the glory. What are you doing here? But, you need women here. No, what are you saying? You can still make it. I tried to talk her out of this, but she's &lt;i&gt;just as stubborn as 1 am.&lt;/i&gt; You idiot! You may not live through this! That goes for you, too. I don't want to be the only one to survive. You! What do you think you're doing? You promised not to lay on hand on them. Go on. SorfY- &lt;i&gt;Don't be sorry.&lt;/i&gt; Thanks. &lt;i&gt;Now 1 have no regrets.&lt;/i&gt; I'll be sure to take care of your ashes. I can't let you go back alive. I knew you would do this. I'll show you the Japanese spirit! Boss! You can't go there! My brother is going to be killed! I understand, but please think about the group! Boss! &lt;i&gt;Masa!&lt;/i&gt; Masa... Get a hold of yourself. Brother... I'm sorry for getting you involved. What are you saying? We're brothers, right? Tomoda... Boss, forgive me. He's late. Osai, I hope you become a good wife to someone someday. No! &lt;i&gt;1 don't want you to die!&lt;/i&gt; I won't many anyone else! &lt;i&gt;1 don't want you to die!&lt;/i&gt; You shouldn't say that. No! Osai! Sai... Hey": Masakichi and Owaku are dead. You have no hope. The two of you need to stay here. Let's go! Brother... We need to get him to a doctor. Go out the back door and get a cart. Sai! Where's everyone? They're all dead. What are you doing? What else do you think I'm going to do? You can't go out there like this! Brother, shall we just retreat for now? No way! You're going out there to die if you step out like that! I know that! Brother! What'll happen to this town if we die now? The Toyokai will just take over again. Please listen to me. Don't go near them. I wonder if it'll be all right. Don't wony. Go on ahead. I hope you're not planning to... Of course not... Forgive me. Why aren't you going with us? They'll go after you if no one is here. So you're... What are you doing? Hum!- Sai... Hum!- Take care, my brother... I'm so glad... Where is this? The hospital. You've been sleeping ever since the surgery. I see. Where's Danshichi? What happened? He died. Died? I see... He did it to save me... You can't get up yet. Dear... Thank you for everything. I hope you're not planning to... They'll kill you. Please don't. We were able to save your life. Please think about staying alive for me. It would be different if Masa and Danshichi were still alive. But they're all dead. We all live and die together. But... I don't want to die either... But it can't be helped. Why do you have to rush to die? You're such a fool! I know that. I have to settle this before they start battling over the chail111an's position in Osaka now that the Owaku boss is dead. Masa refused Owaku': help... I have to do this for him. But, you only have one life. I owe Danshichi my life. I won't waste it. I wonder if Masa and Danshichi are at the crossing. I have to get there or they can't have their toast. Tatsu... Yujiro... I'll go with you. You can't do that. It was just a brief moment that I knew Boss Matsui, but he did more than anyone could ever expect to welcome me. &lt;i&gt;1 need to repay his kindness.&lt;/i&gt; But you have a child. Yes. I left my son with my wife's parents. The boss saved my son's life. Please let me come with you. No... Where did he go? The garden! What are you doing? Hurry and settle this! Tatsu! THE END
