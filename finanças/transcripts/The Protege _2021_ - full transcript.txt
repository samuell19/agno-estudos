It is a rare gift to have a friend who trusts you enough not to try and help until you ask. Mmm. If you fell in a pond with those, you'd drown. Well, if I fell in the pond without 'em, I'd probably float away. Hi, Honey. Ah, ah, ah! Mind your fingers. That heifer bites. She's a baby and doesn't know any better. There. You have your own secret hideout. Why am I not surprised? I bought the building. What? The book store. It's yours, free and clear. You didn't have to do that. I know, but it's your passion. And makes me feel good to know you'll have something worthwhile when I'm gone. What is that? Those are the souls waiting for me on the other side. I'm sure they have a reception planned. Ah, I sent away so many prematurely. Either by my hand or through you. We never sent anyone away who didn't have it coming. Maybe. But I'm sure there are quite a few spirits up there, waiting for me with a bone to pick. Aw. You really believe you're going up? Don't you? Lucas Hayes. I need our friend to find him for me. I have him up to 1998, Paris. After that, nothing. Just find? Just find. Discreetly and with a quickness. Okay. I may have to go back to Vietnam. Be nice if you went with me. I'm never going back there. Our past is never where we left it, Little Chameleon. We all have scars. You stare at them long enough, you remember how you got them. Hi. Morning. The blue dress has a small tear in it. I was hoping to talk to Benny about it? What do you think? Of what? My, um... My mustache. Oh, you know, I don't have my contacts in. Mmm. Sorry. Funny. You wait till this grows in. Women like you are gonna be so... No, no, you're not, are you? No. Need you to find this guy. What, no satellite shots of a mafia compound outside Bucharest? No. But that was some of your better work. Moody wants this guy, Lucas Hayes. Last seen in Paris in '98, and then nothing. Mmm. Ah. I'll be with you in a second. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for a book. An old book. Like, rare. Like, rare? Yeah. Either they are or they aren't. Books aren't like a steak. You can't get them, like, medium rare. That's funny. Sarcastic. Yeah, but funny. Listen, my boss's wife is having a party and she collects books. First editions. Any particular subject? Birds. It's Audubon's, um... Birds of America? Yeah, that's it. He said she's looking for a copy. A first edition? Yeah. Sorry. You don't have it? No one does. Only one first edition exists. It was sold to a private buyer in 1991 for $9.6 million. Wow. Okay. Well, looks like I'm outta luck. All right. What do you think? Maybe poetry? Hang on. You'd be the hit of the party. I don't, uh... I don't know this one. It's Edgar Allen Poe, actually. His first collection of poems, published anonymously. You think she might have it? Doubtful. Only 50 copies were printed, only 12 are known to exist. Hmm. How much? I can give it to you for 265,000. Perhaps a bracelet instead. She does have exquisite wrists. Good idea. Is there something else? I find you interesting. You mean... You're interesting. And beautiful, sure. Not in that ornamental kind of way. It's the interesting part that's got me wondering. Wondering what? How long after I give you my number will it take you to decide that I'm just as interesting and give me a call? Twenty seven minutes. That long? First, I have to pretend to cancel my date and then I have to feed my cat. That's six. The rest is me playing hard to get. Cute. How many of these are you carrying around, Mr... Rembrandt. Michael Rembrandt. Actually, I haven't had an occasion to use one until just now. So... Interesting. "There rose a fountain once, and there Full many a fair flow'r rais'd its head:" That was from the book, wasn't it? "But she who rear'd them was long dead, And in such follies had no part..." You almost got me on this one. You didn't say I'd be tracking an eight year old. Lucas Hayes did arrive in Paris in '98. But returned to Da Nang, March '99. Everything else I have is on there. Benny, you'll stay open until I get there, 45 minutes. Moody. (Vietnamese) Fuck, Man! Shit! What the fuck was that? Fuck. (Honey! Come on.) Never thought I'd see you here again. Well, maybe you're not seeing me now. Who's the bitch? Billy Boy. I know you run with all kinds, but now you're running with stupid? Fuck you! Hey. Go get a drink, Sugar. You give the adults some privacy, huh? Beers! Is that your ride outside? Yours now. It ain't my birthday. Jossino Vohl. How's Moody? He's dead. To Moody. Vohl involved? I don't know. But he knows who is. He's gonna be hard to kill. I just wanna talk to him. Steverino! Yeah, Boss? You worked security at the State Tower. My friend here needs a few minutes with Vohl. Alone. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Goes nowhere without private security. The guy's never alone. (What is happening?) This is how easy it is for me to get to you, Mr. Vohl. Do you understand? You were friends and business partners with Edward Hayes, so you would know most about his short, but interesting life? Good, 'cause I have questions. You give me answers. If I'm satisfied, you'll never see me again. If I'm not, I'll be the last thing you ever see. I look forward to hearing from you. Bonjour, mademoiselle. It's been a long time since such a beautiful young woman gave me her number. You know who I am. Jossino Vohl, born in April 1945. French national residing full time in Vietnam, was in business with Edward Hayes until his untimely death. Now you're a top political power broker with some interesting side hobbies. I see you're familiar with my résumé. I am not interested in your business activities, Mr. Vohl. I want to talk about your friend's son, Lucas. My office. One hour. Will you be alone? My lawyer will be present. That would be the man standing behind you, pouring the scotch? Enchantée, mademoiselle. Exactly on time. Please. Monsieur Duquet, my personal attorney. Would you like some champagne? Edward Arthur Hayes. Mmm. Eddie and I were involved in a bauxite mining project together, until his accident. It wasn't an accident. It was an assassination. We were useful. The country was malleable, ripe for certain business practices. Eddie was juggling a lot of delicate plates. What's your interest in a man who's been dead almost 30 years? I'm interested in his son. Lucas Hayes. I'm sorry? Three people are dead because they inquired about him. He had them killed and I'm going to find him. Should I be talking to him? I have no connection with Lucas Hayes. And what has any of this got to do with me? I was wondering the same thing. Mr. Vohl's past relationships are no one's concern. And certainly none of yours. Well, I've made them my concern. Too bad. I need to know everything. Who are you? Who hired you? Why the interest in Lucas Hayes? We can do this another way, if you'd like. Fucking let me go. Get up there. Hand me a gun. Here. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Say it. Fuck you. Say it! (She's down there!) Let's start with your name. Why was Moody looking for Edward Hayes's son? Who else out there should we know about? Fuck. Anyone ever last this long? It's out of our hands now anyway. Him? That was a long 27 minutes. I'm still waiting for your call. It's all right. I don't take these things personally. Bone broth. Helps with inflammation and bruising. Here. Careful, it's hot. Watch it. There you go. Made this myself. Here you go. Small sips. Good? I'm not gonna lie to you. There's not much chance this ends well for you. That guy out there, we work for the same individual. Boss has a problem, he calls him, he takes care of it. Little heavy handed for my taste, but that's not my call. I'm sorry about your friend, Moody. I had no part of that. Or the firefight at the bookstore. I'm an "After the facts" guy. I come in and make sure there's no loose ends. I look for things that might seem benign, but aren't. Like a bookstore owned by an assassin. Boy, I never saw that one coming. I misread you completely. I can help you outta here, okay? But you have to help me. I'm your last line of defense. End of the road. No more lifelines. You understand? All right. You forgot to blanch the bones. Your soup. You have to blanch the bones before you roast them. It locks the minerals in. It's better for healing. You get anything out of her? Yes and no. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? It means I'll be back in the morning to follow up with her. I don't need you here, Rembrandt. Well, the man who signs the checks felt differently. Oh, yeah? Yeah. And why's that? Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because you killed Vohl without asking his permission. Vohl knew everything. He was a direct connection. He would have folded like a tent. You guys kill me. You're all the same. Shoot first and ask questions later. And hold off on those enhanced interrogation techniques. I want her clearheaded in the morning. He'll break her tomorrow. Maybe he broke her already. The old man is desperate to know what she knows. Wonder how he'd feel if his boy wonder ends up killing her before he finds out. I'm guessing you look for a new boy wonder? Just when we were getting to know each other. I've got teams at every airport, shipyard and train station. She's not gonna run. She's gonna lick her wounds, then she's coming after you. Good. Really? 'Cause right now it's 4-0. She's winning. Where do you buy your suits? 'Cause I've got a cousin who's big and tall, and he has a hard time. Nobody home. Well, we can get you to the border. London may not be safe for you right now. This is Vietnam, Anna. You know what it's like here. You owe it to Moody to stay alive. I know what I owe him. (Vietnamese) (Go.) The fuck you think I gave you the money for... End of the line, Kid. (Vietnamese) (Moody was beautiful.) In his way. He was kind. And not through effort. It was just a part of who he was. He didn't save my life, he gave me a life. He knew who I was and what I'd... Become. And he protected me. Hayes has been dead for 30 years. Vohl is no longer. And you got some very bad people looking for you. Lucas Hayes killed Moody. He knows I'm looking for him. His last known location is Saint Quiteria Hospital. Nobody is as deaf as those who don't wanna listen. I must say, Ms. Nguyen, it's been some time since we've had a visit from the Ministry of Health. And to request records from that far back... Yes, I know. Well, we're hoping to find something in there that will help us rule out environmental factors, as we are in the midst of a study. Thank you. Lucas Hayes... Well before my time here. 2585024586. Copy. I'll get Doc on it. Okay. Doc came through. Pulled his records. And? You sitting down? Lucas Hayes was admitted to Saint Quiteria on the 2nd of June, 1999. And according to his records, never left. I apologize. Seems the boy was readmitted under the name "Christian". Christian, right, his mother's maiden name. He was already here when I arrived. He's been a patient for more than 20 years. He doesn't like to be touched. He can't speak. Also, deaf and blind. And how long has he been like this? He was diagnosed when he was six, I believe. It progressed rapidly. It's a miracle he's lived this long. And who pays for his care? We have a generous endowment. Everyone here is treated for free. Wow. Four men dead and nothing on camera. Place looked like an abattoir. Was it the food? You know, it was bad manners. Yeah, well, that's no way to treat a lady. Oh, I'm no lady. Well, I'm not always a gentleman myself. I wouldn't sell yourself short. Mmm. Well, coming from you, that's a compliment. Listen, I'm in the middle of something, if you don't mind... Hey, how were the good Sisters of Saint Quiteria? Good enough to let me know I've been looking for the wrong person. They're good gals up there. Saint Quiteria, you know who she was? Mm-mmm. Fifteen years old, she led a guerrilla war against the Roman legions. Badass. Yeah. They chopped off her head and fed the rest to the dogs. Again, bad manners. Hey, you up for dinner? I can answer some questions and, you know, save you some time. What do you say, we say to La Cinq? Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. I mean you can say it, but I won't be there. I'll give you a time and place. You're intrigued by her. Curious. Need I worry? The gala list, Sir. Our 200 guests, all vetted. Huh. The joys of a room full of the wealthy and the privileged donating large sums for a noble cause. It never gets old. Good. Why do you do this? It's what people in my position are supposed to do, Michael. Give to the less fortunate. Ah. I asked if I should be worried. About the woman. Nope. Not yet. Please wrap up this unpleasantness by Sunday. I don't wanna be embarrassed before the celebration. Wow. Thank you, Ben. They know me here. Cheers! Someone killed a friend of mine because of a contract he completed years ago. And anyone I ask about it ends up dead. Why is that? Well, I don't know, but some people might take that as a sign. Why don't you just consider it a mystery best left unsolved. But I like mysteries. When I started this, I was curious. And then I went from curious to concerned. And now? I'm testy. And trust me, you don't wanna know me when I'm testy. HK 9 millimeter. Very good. Not where I'm sitting. Who's paying for the orphan kid? I'd like to talk to whoever that is. That would be unwise. Unwise is killing a man who was a second father to me. We are way past unwise. This is a really bad place for a hit. High end restaurant with security at every exit, not to mention the cameras. You know what, you already knew that. Oh, I'm not here to kill you... Yet. Just get answers. You always ask like this? Yeah, I like to have people's attention when I talk, you know? Well, you certainly have the attention of the boys down there. Look, you're going to have to put at least three in me to be sure. Four. Fine. That leaves you five. In case there's trouble. Uh huh. You think that's enough to get you out of here? Four quick shots and then a slow walk to the exit amongst the chaos. Yeah. Something unexpected could happen. You know, usually does. SIG 226. Mmm, it's got that great kick. Kick. Yeah. How about that? Our first awkward silence. You know what? I didn't get your name. Anna. Pleasure. We'll see. What do you say we forget these drinks? Let's just go find a nice hotel. You point a gun at my pussy and then you ask me to bed? I like your style. Said the woman with hollow points pointed at my balls. Well, let's hope this doesn't get messy. These are my favorite shoes. Manolo's, classic four inch pumps. A man who knows Poe and footwear. Let me put this to you delicately. You keep this up, you're gonna die. Vietnam has always been a place of death. Only the lucky ones make it out alive. I was lucky once. You don't get lucky twice. I'm going to find out who killed my friend. And when you do? I'm going to end their life and anyone standing in my way. Thank you for a lovely evening. Hey, I know this sounds crazy, but... I'd really like to see you again. Under, you know, different circumstances. This was personal time. So these are the best circumstances you'll ever see me in. (Vietnamese) Speak. Call me when it's done. Thought you were off chasing corrupt accountants? Found her hotel room, all of her shit, including her passport. Name's Nadia Zhukova. An Asian Russian... Boy. You don't really see that. Ever. Good work. You must be exhausted, huh? Looks like I'm a day late. And a dollar short. Didn't take much I'm afraid. Sang like a bird, did he? Oh, the things I know now. I know who your boss is. The man who sanctioned Moody's killing. Huh. He's a big fish. More fun when you hook 'em. Well, then I guess... I guess we'll be seeing each other real soon then. Sooner than you'd think. Hey, what happened to your hand? ♪ Come closer, Baby ♪ ♪ And lay your lovely face against my skin ♪ ♪ Please don't ♪ ♪ Don't turn away from me Baby ♪ ♪ 'Cause we may never pass this way again ♪ ♪ I can't stop myself from wanting you ♪ Make up your mind. Kill me... Or fuck me. Is it weird that we're in this guy's bed while he's... Up there? You know, hanging? No. Be a waste of a nice bed. Okay. How long you been doing this? Not, you know, this, but... Long enough not to miss. You got lucky. Nah. You don't want me dead... Yet. Why haven't you killed me? Could you? I could put two in the back of your head and go make a sandwich. Well... You always said this wasn't gonna work out. Well, it's been my experience, it never does. At least not for the other guy. There a way around that? You're holding all the cards. I'm watching a woman walk over a shark tank, on a tight rope, in high winds. You're not gonna make it, Anna. He's a bad man who's done very bad things. So, you just gonna lay there? Good to see you, Kid. Get in. Get out. You know you only get lucky once. Yeah, someone else just told me that. Okay. Oh, God! Good God! Ah, ah, ah. Just a little glue. Just a little glue. It's okay. Wrong with you? Grit your teeth. Oh, God. You know, I still feel really bad about Claudia. I mean, she couldn't cook worth a shit, but she didn't deserve to die like that. There we go. Okay. Okay, okay, we're done. We're done here. Did you really think they could kill me that easily? Before I blew the rest of it off, he didn't have much of a face to begin with. And I left just enough of me for the authorities to think it was me. Sorry you had to be the one who found him. But you could always think on your feet anyway. Not so much tonight. That's what friends are for, right? Oh, good. We're friends again. Ooh, you got laid, didn't you? Depending more and more on this shit to take the edge off. So, what's the plan? Four hundred acres. To get there, you'd have to hike through 12 miles of rat infested jungle. That leaves a river, cameras, sonar, patrol boats. Still a pessimistic little shit, aren't you? And you're still a cockroach you can't kill. I mean that in a good way. They know you're coming. What is this? It's a panic room. In this case, it's a panic bunker. If he gets in there, you're done. All the guests arrive by boat. They'll be screened the moment they disembark. Perimeter locked down and site secured. And I've added an additional team of 16 out of Israel just for the night. Seems like you got everything covered. Michael. Thoughts? Venice. It's really nice this time of year. You should go. Now. These guys have no idea who they're dealing with. (Vietnamese) You look a little tense. I've protected everyone from crown princes to cartel kingpins. Nothing's gonna happen tonight, especially when we know what she looks like. Boy, I really hope you got paid up front. Sir? Anything? Nothing so far. Sectors 1, 2 and 3 are clear. I'm waiting on the reports from sector 4. Mmm. Thank you. It is with great pleasure that I welcome you all here on this very expensive evening. It warms my crusty heart to look across the room and see so many familiar faces, dear friends and close business associates, as well as quite a few unfamiliar faces that, with luck, will not remain so for long. Perhaps I may even have spotted a few former foes of mine. I want especially to thank you for coming and for seeing the error of your ways. Over these considerable years, I've learned to my great satisfaction there is no better way to cleanse the soul than to do good, to perform selfless deeds and acts of kindness, to sacrifice for others, and most importantly, to give generously. It is due to your generous spirit that we have been able to enrich and enhance the lives of so many infants, children, young men and women in desperate need of care to a degree that would have been impossible to achieve without every one of you. Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for the privilege of being your host tonight. And for allowing me to slide my hands into your pockets and purses. But for a worthy cause. The Sisters of Saint Quiteria do outstanding work, so give with your hearts. Get to the door now! You look really good for a man who's been dead 30 years, Mr. Hayes. How'd you get in here? Technology. Shit's gonna fuck us all one day. Who are you? I'm the big bad wolf that comes to get you when someone on this earth decides your time is up. Moody. Resurrection's a bitch, ain't it? Come to finish the job, have you? Well, you did hire me all those years ago to kill you, right? Who was really in that car? Does it matter? Disposable asset. No one of consequence. See, that's the kind of shit I expect someone like you to say. "No one of any consequence." Someone like me? I mean, I can't be all morally righteous. I kill people for a living. Bad people, mind you. But still, I never pretend to be anything else. You, you're front and center of a dozen high profile charitable causes. The world sees you as clean as first fucking snow. But your hands are covered in shit and blood, and everything from sarin gas to human trafficking. So you know why I had to arrange my demise. I had a son. Unexpected in many ways. But what I couldn't fathom was the depth of love I had for this child, this imperfect, wonderful, vulnerable boy. If I were dead, Lucas would be free from any threats or harm. Bullshit. You may love your son, Mr. Hayes, but this was your chance to disappear. You're very astute. No one looks for a dead man. I was able to continue behind a shroud of respectability that allowed me to... To become a bigger monster. The irony of all this, Mr. Hayes, is that I was just trying to make amends to your son for taking his father away from him. You brought all this upon yourself. Anna. You don't look so good. Oh, I don't know. Nothing an apple martini and a liter of AB positive won't fix, huh? Hey, what do you think the chances are of me getting either? Faint. Something funny? I find it amusing you think you're better than me. Not better. Different. See, most people are good, Mr. Hayes. And occasionally, they do something they know is bad. Some people are bad, and they struggle every day to keep it under control. Others are corrupt to the core and just don't give a damn. That would be me. But evil? Evil is a completely different creature, Mr. Hayes. Evil believes bad is okay, its actions justified. Violence divorced from conscience. No matter what toll it takes, or who it takes it upon. And there, my friend, is where we part ways. I'm just a bad man who's looking to pay for his sins. I see. So you're here to clear your conscience first? You'll never get out of here alive. I never intended to. One more thing. You could have killed the old man. Why didn't you? That wasn't the plan. Leave me alone! No! No! Stop! Stop! No! Mama! No! Mama!
