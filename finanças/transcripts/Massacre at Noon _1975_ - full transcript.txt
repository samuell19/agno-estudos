Have crossed the 3,000-kilometer border and are invading Russian territory with unstoppable charge. The German army groups, commanded by Field Marshal von Leeb, Field Marshal von Bock, and Field Marshal von Ruhmstett, inflicted fatal blows on the Bolshevik army on the whole front. The Soviet Air Force is devastated. In only a few hours, the key of the Soviet central defense fell. Here is the German broadcast over all channels. (fanfare on radio) Gentlemen, to our final victory. Dear friends, this is very important. Now is the time for us to raise up against the Nazis. We must do everything that we can for our homeland. Friends, what can I tell you? You are all Freedom Fighters. You all took part, from the very first day, in the preparations for the organization of an armed uprising. Well, the time has come that we no longer belong either to ourselves or to our families. The country asks us to take up arms and to defend the honor and freedom of our people. Lieutenant. I order you to lock up the city immediately. I want to see all communists in the city behind bars. Understood? Yes, Sir! We have to pay attention to the ironworkers. They work in the aircraft factory. There is the Communist's Nest. Please, gentlemen. According to my information, there are many communists. I quote for example: Professor Grüner from Marburg, Doctor Wemitschow, Sarajevo, workers of the factory, teacher Yelichich with wife, dockers from Ogulin, the brothers Boschichich. Arambramich, who is that? Here. Worker, very dangerous communist. Probably one of the leaders. I want him dead or alive. Lieutenant, you are personally responsible for the success of this action.

Serbs, my fellow countrymen. The Nazis are making the whole city of Kraljevo hostage. All the roads leading in and out of the city are closed. They are herding all men, women and children they can lay their hands on into the factory compound. We have to attack them from three sides. Your platoon, Marc, has to reach the factory, at all costs, to liberate the hostages. Your attack has to be a total surprise. My group will attack from the river bank, here. Your group, Rand, has to break into town using the hanging bridge. Your platoon, Vragon, has to cover the main road to Kraljevo and block reinforcements. It sounds like a suicide attack. If we fail, there will be thousands of dead people tomorrow. This is the most important battle we can have. The situation is frightening: 700 rebel workers from the factory who tried to get out of town and join us, were captured in town before even reaching the outskirts. Nazi tanks and machine gun emplacements encircle the entire town. Nobody can leave or go into town. Hitler's radio address to his generals ordered them to kill 100 innocent men, women or children in Serbia for each German soldier killed. We don't have much time. The Nazis outnumber us. Heavily armed, heavy artillery. We must not fail. Are the Nazis over there? There's no one at defense. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Where are your other men? - Major ordered their retreat. - Hmm. SS Officer: We were told the direction of the main attack. Right here. Start at 7:30 pm. That's good. That's good, gentleman. Major? Yes? The tank battalion. And concentrate the entire squad on the bridge. Captain? Yes, Mr. Major? Secure the hostage camp here. Understood? Let's do this. Partisan: Heh, I never dreamed I'd be liberating Kraljevo with a German tank. Hey, do you know how to drive this thing so we can get out of here? Soldier: Ask a man... I don't know how to stop it.

Where did they get tanks from? I don't know. You don't know? This is the first time I hear of it. You have to know. Lieutenant, you have to know. They can't make it to the camp. And if so? It can't happen. And what do we do if they reach the camp? It won't happen. Never! Captain Roht? Take the last reserves immediately. Yes, Mr. Major. (bombing in distance) Write this.

Now I'm with you and with the Partisans to the final end and the victory! By order of the Führer, Serbia's war operations were entrusted to Infantry General Franz Böhme. His top secret command is: One: In retaliation for every German soldier killed, or ethnic German man, woman or child, shoot 100 prisoners or hostages. Two: For every wounded German soldier or ethnic German, 50 prisoners or hostages. These reckless measures must be a deterrent example that will soon be known throughout Serbia. If we don't act with all severity and the greatest ruthlessness, our losses will increase to the immeasurable. Your task is to occupy the country, since 1914 great blood, German blood flowed, because of the cunning of the Serbs, their men and women. You are the avengers of these dead. For the whole of Serbia, a deterring example should be made, that will hit the entire population. Anyone who deals with them mildly, sins against his comrades and will be held accountable. And put in a court martial. This command is effective immediately. Franz Böhme, on September 25th, 1941. Heil Hitler. Short Officer: Sarajevo... Sarajevo is in a state of emergency today. Because of the cooperation of the citizens... with the Partisans, General Böhme orders retribution. First Lieutenant. The division command assigns you 6,000 hostages and orders you to execute the command. I, First Lieutenant, Alfons Matsiovitz, swear, the moment of reckoning with this city has come. They will feel me forever. Long live the Führer! - Sieg. - Heil. - Sieg. - Heil. - Sieg. - Heil. (song in foreign language) "Dear sons and my family. The time has come for me, as your father... to say good-bye. And I want to tell you that I'm going to be leaving... to be slaughtered by the Nazis. Son, you are the head of the household now, so take good care of the house and do the work that needs to be done. Lord knows if I'll ever return. Watch your mother, keep an eye on her and help her with all the chores. Remember me, my name, what I've stood for, what I've done. Always remember the country and family. Most of all, remember the country and your countrymen, how they stand together to fight for what we believe. You have my blood in your veins. You can do it. So this is what I want you to remember most of all. You are my son, you're strong, brave. You can do it if you try. Just stand and be a man. Kosta, keep close to our daughter. You be close with all our friends. All of them and their families. Give our best to Mitzi and Andrew. So now, please gather your courage. I love you forever. Your father."
