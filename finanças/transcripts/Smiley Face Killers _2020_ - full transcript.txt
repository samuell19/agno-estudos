Holmes's mutilated body was found just two days after Graham was reported missing from the off-campus apartment they shared. And on Saturday, Graham was reportedly in an altercation with another student named Robert Delaney, and hasn't been seen since. He thought I was messing with him. He thought I was jealous he was dating my ex. I don't think Jake was the kind of guy to just, like, disappear or check out. We're told Graham is a popular, handsome, athletic student, a member of the varsity soccer team and seemingly untroubled, but some of his friends are telling us a different story. He went off his meds. And, uh... I think he was sending texts to himself. I gotta admit that he seemed, like, really down lately, so... [sniffs loudly] I don't know. I think he was delusional. They found the guy's blood in his room and in the hall. I still don't think he had anything to do with Devon's death, and I'm... pretty shocked that people think he did. I'm just really worried that he might've, um... done something to himself. ♪♪ [seagulls cry] ♪♪ [waves crashing] [instrumental music playing]
