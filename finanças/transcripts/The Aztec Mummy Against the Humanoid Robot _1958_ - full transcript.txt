The Aztec Mummy Against the Humanoid Robot (1958) How far can the human mind scrutinize the mysteries of the beyond? Who knows? This film is based on an extraordinary scientific experiment... carried out by Doctors Hughes and Tony... from the Institute of Hypnotherapy of the Los Angeles University. It is authentic without a doubt. The testimonies of the people who participated in it... as well as a notary, bear witness to its authenticity. This movie version has interwoven reality and fiction. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Dr. Diaz, Dr. Estelle, it's a pleasure to see you again. - Good evening, Mrs. Almada. - How are you? Very well, thank you, and you? Always working. Prescribing to help people die well. That's not true. But go ahead, my husband awaits you. Good evening, gentlemen. I appreciate you taking the trouble to come to my home tonight. - It's no trouble. - It's a pleasure, Dr. Almada. We have another chance to see such a lovely girl as Flor. You flatter me. - How are you, Pinacate? - Fine, Doctor. - Please do sit down. - Thank you. Dr. Diaz, Dr. Estelle, I've invited you here tonight... because I must reveal some serious events to you. What is it about? - The Aztec breastplate and bracelet. - What? That chapter had already been closed, completely forgotten. We thought so... but several things have happened and I want you to know about them. Allow me to go back in time. Though you know some parts, there are others that you do not. So I shall start from the beginning. As you remember, five years ago... the first Congress on Neuropsychiatric Investigation... in this city. I went to the Congress... to present my paper on regression to past lives... using hypnotism. My theory caused a wave of shock among those present... you were there, Dr. Estelle and you too, Dr. Diaz. If I remember correctly, Dr. Krupp was next to you. Because my work was rejected, I left the congress a defeated man. I arrived here full of confusing ideas, feeling depressed. But I was convinced of the truth of my ideas. I needed only to prove it. That same night, Flor volunteered to be hypnotized... in spite of knowing the danger involved in the experiment. Her father and Pinacate helped me to hypnotize her. During her past life, Flor lived in the Aztec Empire. She gave us amazing details. Flor, in those days was called Xochi... and shared a great Jove with Popoca, a proud and powerful warrior. Joined by this strong love, and knowing she must die a virgin... in honor of her god, Tecacztlipoca... they defied that law and decided to escape. But they were discovered by the priests. The punishment, they buried Popoca alive... cursing his soul for eternity. They put the breastplate and bracelet with the hieroglyphics on Xochi... they indicate where the Aztec treasure is buried. And she was sacrificed. At that very moment, when we were about to finish the experiment... the strangest thing happened. Flor was in a very nervous state. Her blood pressure dropped to almost nothing... and we feared for her life. Soon after, we found out that Dr. Krupp... turned into a terrible bandit called The Bat... found out about our experiment. The experiment was a complete success. But knowing that no one would believe it... if we didn't offer proof of it... we decided to find the Aztec breastplate and bracelet... guided by Flor. We found an underground corridor... in the old pyramid of Teotihuacan. - Professor, we cannot go on. - It can't be... the Aztecs would not build a tunnel to end it in a wall. There must be another way in. Professor, it seems to be hollow. But the wall is too thick to tear it down. Pinacate, help me. We must be below the pyramid. Yes, but this isn't the temple. Edward, come! Look! - What's wrong? - There's a hole here. It's a ventilation shaft. - It must lead somewhere. - Probably to the temple. What are we waiting for? Let's go. After climbing down several flights of stairs... we saw the horrible face of the god of Tecacztlipoca. We were in the lower temple... in the Aztec tomb which Flor had spoken of. We saw Xochi's skeleton. She wore the breastplate of solid gold. It's Xochi, how awful! Father, that was me! We are the first to come in here. A world that has slept for centuries... awakens with our arrival. We will finally know the truth. No, Edward, don't do it! Now I will be able to prove to the scientific world... the truth in my theory. How amazing. Once I had the breastplate in my power... I arranged to see you both as well as Dr. Krupp, remember? Of course... it was one of the most exciting moments of my life. It's true. You'll also remember that I said I was going to devote myself... to studying the hieroglyphics on the breastplate... and that they indicated the exact spot where the Aztecs kept their treasure. Yes, but if I remember correctly you still needed the bracelet. Exactly, the two objects complement each other. Without the bracelet, I was unable to understand the hieroglyphics. So I decided to go after it, in spite of the Aztec curse. He who desecrates an Aztec tomb and finds the breastplate... his family's life and his own will be in danger... until the breastplate returns to its place. Together with my wife's father... the wise Dr. Sepulveda and my friend Pinacate... we entered the tomb once more. Just as I was about to take the bracelet... the professor warned me of something that he had noticed. What is that? Isn't that Popoca's shroud? According to Flor's story, yes. Then, where is he? We could hear strange footsteps coming towards us. Coming out of the dark, we saw Popoca's horrifying mummy. The Aztec warrior had come to life once more... because we had taken the objects left in his custody. Turn off your flashlights for a moment. Turn them on and aim the beam at its eyes! Turn them off! Turn them on! Quick! Through the ventilation shaft! Pinacate! Professor! Help me! That time I thought was the end of me. If it hadn't been for my friends, I would have died. Incredible. A mummy that comes back to life after centuries of being dead. Dr. Diaz, you have my word of honor that what you have just heard is true. When Popoca was buried alive for the love he shared with Xochi... he was cursed and punished with guarding... the breastplate and bracelet for all time... since his cursed soul would never rest in eternal peace. Go on, Edward. The Bat tried several times to get hold of these objects. Time went by. We thought he had forgotten about it. But the curse of the Aztecs pursued us. One night, the mummy came here to get his objects... and he took Flor. He had placed her on the sacrificial stone... next to Xochi's skeleton. He put the bracelet and breastplate on her. The mummy intended to sacrifice Flor... as Xochi had been sacrificed centuries before... in honor of their god Tecaztlipoca. We had come to the pyramid to help Flor... and we looked with horror upon the scene. The mummy had drawn close to her with a knife. He was going to kill her. I jumped down. With a shot, I was able to disarm the mummy. He grabbed me by the neck with his huge hands... and began to choke me. When all seemed lost, something happened. Flor's father, holding up a crucifix... was able to keep the monster at bay. While the Professor kept the mummy at a distance... we freed Flor from the ropes. The Professor told us to get out. Because he pressed us urgently and Flor was so frightened... we obeyed him and left. We got out but when we saw that the Professor did not follow... we decided to go back for him. Just then... a tremendous explosion shook the earth. Dr. Sepulveda gave his life to save ours. With the mummy buried under the rocks... and The Bat in police custody... we thought it was all over. But unfortunately, it was not to be. The Bat, none other than Dr. Krupp... escaped from jail... and when he tried to find the objects... he took my daughter and Flor, whom he hypnotized. Go on, please. What happened afterwards? In that state, she led them to the Aztec tomb... and The Bat took the breastplate and bracelet from the mummy. A short time after, I received a call. The Bat wanted me to decipher the hieroglyphics... and get a hold of the treasure. - Did you accept? - I had no choice. The lives of my wife and daughter were at risk. Incidentally, on that occasion... I found it strange when Dr. Krupp said... that the Aztec treasure had the wealth he needed... to carry out an experiment that would make him immortal. And so, that same night, forced by The Bat... I began to decipher the hieroglyphics. I knew our lives were in danger in the hands of those bandits. Our only hope was that the mummy... who had had the objects stolen from him... would come there guided by unknown forces... as had already occurred. When I could no longer put off the translation... I handed it over to The Bat. - It's finished. - Finally! I hope you will now keep your word and let us go. Yes. You know what you have to do, Tender. What do you intend to do? Kill us? - What do you think? - You miserable swine! No!! Help me!! Save me!! No!! Help me!! The mummy took care of all the bandits. And just when The Bat was about to escape... the monster picked him up and threw him in the chamber of death. Later... with the breastplate and bracelet in his hands... the mummy left, disappearing into the night. We shall always remember Dr. Sepulveda with affection... and how with wisdom he showed us how to save our lives. And the mummy? Did it return to the pyramid? No, with his temple destroyed, he had no need to be there. Then, where is he? Allow me to continue. The day after that terrible night... I called the police and told them what had happened. Together with the captain and several police officers... we went to The Bat's home. To our great surprise, the place was empty. The laboratory had also disappeared... as well as the body of the man the mummy had killed. With dismay, we went to the chamber of death. We looked down and saw only the snakes. The Bat's body was not there. With terror, we discovered a small door... which The Bat could have used to escape. The Bat had escaped alive in spite of the deadly snakebites. Incredible! Did he try to once again steal the Aztec bracelet and breastplate? Exactly, Dr. Estelle. Sooner than we thought. The Bat went into action and one night... This is the place, Tender. Do you think this plan will work out, Master? You'll see. Now be completely silent, don't even move. Flor, I order you to come to me. Flor, I order you to come to me. Flor, I order you to come to me. Flor, I order you to come to me. Flor, I order you to come to me!! Flor, I order you to come to me!! Flor, I order you to come to me. Flor, I order you to come to me!! I order you to pick up the mind waves of the Aztec mummy... and tell us if you can lead us to it. Yes, I can. Where is Popoca? The old cemetery. Let's go. What are you doing here? Answer! What are you doing...? Go, Flor. Go on. FRANCISCO DE URQUIJO COUNT OF OAXACA LAST DESCENDANT OF AZTEC KING - Is this it? - Yes. I curse you! I curse you a thousand times! I would like to destroy you right now. That is my wish also, Tender. But we cannot do anything just now. As long as my experiment is not finished... - we must wait. - Wait? How can I wait with so much hatred inside?! You have no idea what it's like to live like this... hiding from everyone. It's the monster's fault that my face looks like this. Don't worry, Tender. I promise I will destroy the mummy! But give me time. I need time. You shall have your revenge... and I shall have the breastplate and the bracelet! So close to them and not be able to have them/ But if I should remove them, he would come to life once more... and he'd destroy us. But I shall return! I swear it! I don't care how much time goes by... it shall all be mine, you infernal creature/ Let us go now, Tender. We need much time... to achieve what we want. Yes, Master. Let us go. Now listen carefully, Flor. You will go to your bedroom and go to bed. When you awaken tomorrow, you shall lead your life normally... and you won't remember a thing, do you understand? You won't remember a thing. Now go. Go. Go. Good morning. - Good morning, sweetheart. - You slept late today. We were waiting for you to have breakfast, we're hungry. What will you have for breakfast? Nothing, Maria, I woke up with a terrible headache. What's that on your robe? It's dirty. How strange. - It looks like cobwebs. - That's right. - That's strange. - Look at your slippers. - What have you been doing, honey? - Nothing. These slippers were brand new and now they're... Did you go out into the garden last night? No, after I bathed I went straight to bed. Yes, but you got up during the night. I did? Yes, I woke up several times last night and you weren't in bed. You're wrong, Anita. I'm sure I didn't get up. I even called out your name. Let's not argue about that now. She must have dreamt it, it's not important. Has your headache gone away? No, I'd better go lie down. Excuse me. - Children, go have breakfast. - Yes, Father. Come, Pinacate, we need to talk. You're such a liar. Flor wasn't there, you're the liar. Pinacate, I'm worried. All the details we've observed in Flor are not normal. I'm afraid The Bat has something to do with this. Then you think the child is telling the truth... and that Flor really did get up? Yes, it's highly probable. But Flor is sure she didn't do anything. That's because she doesn't remember. When she got up, she was asleep. I don't understand. How is that possible? Listen, Pinacate. Flor was hypnotized by The Bat some time ago. He can give her orders again with his mind... from a distance. All the details we've observed in Flor... indicate that she has been in his power during the night. - Where did he take her? - Where do you think? What does The Bat care about the most? - The breastplate and the bracelet. - Exactly. Then he must have ordered her to take him where the mummy rests. We must know where the mummy rests... to know if that bandit has stolen the objects. It will be difficult, there are no clues to follow. Listen, Edward... why don't we have Flor's slippers analyzed... to determine the origin of the dirt on it? That could help us. You're right, there's no harm in trying it. But we must have it analyzed without her noticing it. We must hide everything from her. Come. Yes, there's no doubt. Besides the dirt, there are particles... though a less amount, of marble dust. Of marble? Do you observe any special characteristics? No, but it does seem to be of a fine quality. It may be Carrara marble. The kind used in cemeteries to build mausoleums. Thank you. This is the last cemetery to inspect. If we don't find anything here, we'll have failed. Good evening. Good evening, are you the cemetery guardian? Yes sir, may I help you? We need help. We would like to know if you have noticed... some time ago or recently, anything suspicious... that might have struck you as odd in the cemetery. - Are you police officers? - Yes, exactly. We are looking for a dangerous criminal... that may be hiding out in one of the city's cemeteries. Well, something unpleasant did happen to me. Two nights ago, I was surprised to see a young woman in white... walking among the tombs, followed by two strangers. When I asked them who they were... they hit me on the head and left me lying on the ground. May we take a look around here? As you wish, as you wish. See? I was right. We are on their trail. Now the hard thing will be to find the mummy's resting place. Look, let's break up. You go that way, I'll go this way. Go. Edward! Edward, come! What's wrong? Look! Let's go. Look, the breastplate and the bracelet. They didn't steal them. Everything in my story happened five years ago. We have visited the crypt periodically, and the mummy is there... with the breastplate and the bracelet. What about The Bat? We never heard from him again... until two days ago when we saw an article in the newspaper... that surprised us very much. The article said that the night before, a corpse had been stolen... from the amphitheater. Was The Bat the one who stole the corpse? Yes. At first, we weren't sure... because the man they attacked was unable to describe his attackers. But later, we confirmed our suspicions. Yesterday, there was a theft at the Cancer Institute... they stole radium equipment... and it coincided with the theft of a human brain. This time, they were positively identified... as The Bat and his band. They were almost caught. What did you do? Given the fact that lead is the only metal... that protects you from radium... we decided to search all the shops that sell that metal. After visiting several places... Good morning. Good morning, may I help you? We hate to bother you but we'd like to know... if you recently sold a large amount of lead sheets. - Recently? - Yes, within the last seven days. Let me see. We register all purchases in this book. Yes, here it is. Five days ago, we delivered 20 lead sheets... 6 inches thick to 22 Silence Street. - Thank you. - You're welcome. After so much work, we discovered his address... where we believe The Bat is hiding out. What I don't understand is why this bandit... stole the radium, the body and brain of a man. Remember The Bat told Flor that he was working on an experiment? That might be the explanation. It's possible... but Dr. Krupp is certainly involved in something diabolical. That is what we fear. I have told you this story because as men of science... you will know how to deal with The Bat... should we be killed. Are you both planning to go alone to that place without the police? Yes, because we are not sure that it is The Bat's hideout. The captain doesn't believe us much because of what happened before. Flor, if we are not back by 3:00 a.m... - please notify the police. - Edward! Don't move! Dr. Almada. What a surprise. Tender? Yes. Something to remember the mummy by. The master will be happy to receive you. This way. Master... look what we found. Dr. Almada and the Angel. This is certainly a tremendous surprise. After so long, it's pleasant to meet with such good friends. - Where did you find them? - In the workshop, snooping around. I must congratulate you for your talent as detectives. - Was there anyone else? - No, Master. I saw them when they got out of their car, alone. Tender, treat our guests as they deserve to be treated. - Offer them a seat. - Yes, Master. How is your charming wife, Dr. Almada? I heard you were married... my belated congratulations to you. And our friend, the Angel, how are you? Still fighting to see goodness win? I'm sure you are, right? Come in. Who would've known that you would arrive just in time... to see something surprising... and of a tremendous greatness? As soon as you find out what this is all about... I have no doubt that as a scientist... you shall be the first to congratulate me. Frankly, I'm very happy to have you here, Dr. Almada. Someone of your intellectual capacity will understand better than anyone... the grandeur of my invention. Ever since we last met... I have worked night and day, tirelessly. During this time I've explored unknown powers... unveiled the deepest mysteries of creation. You have dared to defy the limits set by God. We could have the secret of many things in our power... if fear did not limit our research, Dr. Almada. You are so perverse and ignorant! Haven't you ever asked yourself... where life comes from? I have! I discovered the cause! Do you see this heart? It lives because I have given it life! If I could give life to lifeless matter... why not renew life in the bodies condemned to rot by death? No one can understand my eagerness. When I dug in the mud of the tombs... or tortured live animals... to give breath to lifeless plaster! You're insane! And so I imagined a man and worked to create him! There is the product of my work! My masterpiece, Dr. Almada/ The human robot!! Tonight I will know if I have achieved my greatest ambition. To give life to this creature. But that's monstrous, Doctor! If this happens, my success will be double! Because the Aztec treasure will be mine. This creature will get rid of the mummy forever! Tender, let's get to work! Stand back, everyone! It's 2:30 a.m. Why don't we just call the police? I don't know what to do. No, we must wait till 3:00 a.m. as the doctor requested. What if they're in danger? It is a success! It is a success! There he is! The greatest wonder ever created by man's intelligence! The human robot. With this creature, nothing on earth can stop me! Do you know what would have happened... if I hadn't cut off the vital power it needs to move... and that I feed to him with this control? With just one touch... you would have been destroyed. Because the robot is loaded with radium... enough to disintegrate anything! Including the mummy. Tender, prepare the armored truck with the sheets of lead. There's no time to lose! We must take our robot for a stroll... to a certain cemetery. What time is it? It's ten to three! No time to lose, Tender! Quickly! Miss, the Police Captain's office. I wish to speak to the Captain, please. Have you ever thought for even a moment... what the world would be with a thousand robots like mine? The human race would be subject to a theory never conceived of. I plan to make a few more. Once you know the way, it's easy. But I need money. The Aztec treasure! And today I shall take the first step towards getting it. - Master, everything is ready. - Good. You will stay to keep an eye on our guests. Watch them carefully. They are of great importance to me. I'm sorry I can't take you with me, you'd be in the way. But I shall be back soon to inform you of the mummy's destruction. And once the breastplate and the bracelet are in my power... we shall begin with the translation of the hieroglyphics. This time no one will come to your rescue... Dr. Almada. Quickly, Captain, let's go. - Edward! - Flor! What has happened? - Captain, arrest the two men inside. - Let's go! Doctor, The Bat is on his way to where the mummy rests. Let's go quickly! There's no time to lose! Quickly, Tender! Remove the breastplate and the bracelet from the mummy! Yes, Master. Finally, you damn mummy. Finally, I'll have my revenge! Popoca... in memory of that great love we shared... do not cause any more deaths. Take these objects that belong to you... and rest in peace in our ancestors' tomb... from which we should never have taken you. The End 1 hr 4 min 4 sec, 24 fps. Spanish soundtrack ONLY.
