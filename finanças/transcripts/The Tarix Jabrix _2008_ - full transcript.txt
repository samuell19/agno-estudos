"Motorcycle Gang Is Getting More Unsettling" "Motorcycle Gang Member is Suspected of Muggling" "Five People were Dead Because of Gang's Brawl" "Motorcycle Gang War, Three Dead, Seven Wounded" "The Tarix Jabrix" Sorry for waiting too long. Can you tell me... ... how it started? At first... ... it was dark and cold. - What's your name? - Cacing, Bro. Bro? You're not a Road Devils member yet. Don't be full of yourself. You can't call me "bro". Call me General. Sorry, General. Yes, General. You want to ride a motorcycle or to march? The gloves for riding is like this. Not like this. Shut up! The one who decides who joins Road Devils... ... is only me, the General. So you must pass three tests. If you pass, all six of you will become Road Devils members. But remember if you all fail... ... you will all go back to become real losers. If you succeed in becoming Road Devils members... ... then you must prepare the consequences. Follow the rules of Road Devils. Read the rules. Yes, Boss. The rules are... The first rule is dare to break traffic rules. The second rule, dare to defend the guilty person. And the last rule, dare to defy your parents. Cacing. I'm your mom, Cacing. I never have a mom like you. Get off me! Cacing. I curse you to become stone. "Physical Test Requirements 1, Tough. 2, Brave. 3, Durable" Hit him! Forgive me Allah. "Failed" "Mental Test Requirements 1, Sadistic. 2, Cruel. 3, Nonchalant" Muggler! When you are adults... ... you have to obey... ... your parents, your family,... ... your neighborhood, this nation, and this country. I hope someday you will become the hero of the nation. Mam. Let me return this, Mam. Mam, don't die. Mam... "Failed" "Skill Test" "Go to Bandung riding a motorcycle." "Requirements 1, No Lights. 2, No Brake." No. Don't do that. Don't break it. My lamp and break are new. I bought them with my nine-months saving. Please. In the name of Allah. "Failed" What about you? What's your story? I'm basically a motorcycle kid. My dad has a motorcycle workshop. "Certificate of Merit" Just by reading this magazine you think you can build a motorcycle? Do your job! Wait a second. That's your dad? Based on birth certificate... What's that for? I have an abnormality since I was a kid. It's some kind of amnesia. The medic term is Pause Sleep Memory Loss. So if I fall asleep, I always forget... ... about what happened before I sleep. Dang. Dadang. Dang. I never thought that you're such a hot person. What did we just do? You must be responsible for that. I didn't write it in my note. Of course because you didn't have time to write it. - You were so horny back then. - No way. It's true. I'm not lying. When will we do it again? I'm lucky to have a friend like Cacing. Dang. Dang. Dang. Dang, last night I thought about it carefully... ... that we should form motorcycle gang. - Motorcycle gang? - That's right. Motorcycle gang, Dang. So that we can be cool like them. Not doing the same things all day. We just hang out only at school and your workshop. We should do it while we're young. What kind of motorcycle gang, Cing? - Motorcycle gang... - Harley motorcycle? Motorcycle gang, Dang. - Big motorcycle? - No. - Small motorcycle? - No. Antique motorcycle? Our motorcycles are old, Cing. Aren't you embarrassed of that? No, Dang. Dang, don't think about that part. Our motorcycle gang is not about the brand. The most important thing, Dang, our gang doesn't break the rule. Not a criminal one, Dang. Hey, how about it, Dang? How about it? You agree? Agree? You're the best. Okay, I'll inform Mulder, Coki, and Ciko. Tomorrow we'll gather here. Okay? Okay. That's why I always write down all important things. But, now I switch to this. A gift from my dad. It's now the twin turn. Ciko and Coki, right? Wrong. - I'm Ciko. - And I'm Coki. We are twin. I'm Coki, born two minutes earlier than my brother, Ciko. Ciko, why haven't you taken a bath? See? Coki is already neat. I'm Coki, Mom. I'm Ciko, Mom. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday to you. - Cok, it's a motorcycle. Vespa 1964. Still good. Look at this. I have more presents. They're cool, right? With this scooter, we both feel like real bikers twin brothers. Now it's your turn to tell your story. It's not important. I don't feel like talking about family. I will not disappoint my only child. It's a gift for you. Thank you, Dad. I'm glad you bought me a car. But you'd better sell that car. - Because... - Why? It's not a nice car, old, or something else? I don't want a car. I want a motorcycle. Don't be like your grandma in Medan. Moreover, Mom and Dad will never allow you... ... to ride a motorcycle, ever. Understand? - No motorcycle. - Dad. You'd better ride a rickshaw... - ... than ride a motorcycle. - Dad. Wait a second. Where do you come from? I'm from Bandung... ... but I lived in Medan for a long time. Where is your motorcycle? There... Awesome... This motorcycle is so cool. - Old motorcycle, Cep. - Great. - Where is the key? - The key? - What for, Cep? - I want to ride it. No, Cep. Your dad will be angry. Calm down. I'll bear the responsibility. Just say you want to pick me up. But, Cep... How do I go home? Here, use my car. No, Cep Mul. No. - Bye. - No. Where do you go? No, Cep Mul. He's coming at last. We've been waiting for you. Sorry, Cing. Sorry, all. - I met a motorcycle gang. - Why? - They almost hit me. - Are you serious? - Seriously. - Your motorcycle is antique, Mul. Where did you get it? It's my dad's driver's, Dang. Fix it. Alright. Let's talk about the motorcycle later. There's more important thing to discuss. Come here. You knew it already, right? So many bad motorcycle gangs. And they become more and more violent. They oppress the weak. Cing, who does oppress you? Mulder is the proof, he almost got hit by the motorcycle gang. - Isn't that right, Mul? - That's right. I, you, Dang,... ... Mulder, Ciko, Coki, we have to make motorcycle gang. We have to show them that we can make a motorcycle gang as well. We can be cool, too. But before we must be determined. We have to synchronize our vision and mission. How about it? How about it? Why so quiet? How about it? Okay. How about it? Astagfirullah... How about it? - Are we going? - Where are you going? Going to hell? Hey, Cockatoo, get down! Dadang, help me! Go away! Gosh... Come out, quick. Is it safe yet? - How about it? - How about what? Motorcycle gang. I follow Ciko's decision. I agree. I follow Coki's decision. That's not what I meant. The answer. Is it okay? - Okay. - Okay. Dang, now it's your turn. - My motorcycle is old, Cing. - So what? I'll just stay in the workshop, helping my dad. Dang, our motorcycle are old as well. The most important thing is the togetherness. Dadang! But, if Ciko and Coki's, Mulder's, and your motorcycle are broken,... ... I'll give you free service. - May I borrow this? - Okay. Cing, if Dadang doesn't join us, it's hard. Who will fix our motorcycle if it's broken down? You're right, Mul. I think about it as well... ... if Dadang doesn't join our motorcycle gang. Dadang is kind, honest, and cool. But when his oblivious disease comes around, sometimes... ... he is a bummer. Alright then, right now we don't have to think about it. What is the name of our gang, Mul? Susmar, Cing. - Sukses "Success" Makmur "Prosper". - That's right. Do you think it's a metal shop? Sukses Makmur. Then they will call me Koh Cacing. Do you have an idea, Cing? How about The Dingdam. - What do you mean? - Dingin "cool" and damai "peaceful". If our heart is cool, there will be peace. Then we persuade that brutal motorcycle gangs... ... to create peace. We'll show them that we are a polite motorcycle gang... ... who obey the traffic rules... ... and respect elder people. You speak like a country leader... Try another idea. Hey. Why are you just playing around instead of helping me find a name? Get over it, Cing. The point is we all agree to form a motorcycle gang. We can name it later, Cing. We'll go. - Where? - Let's end this. I have a bad mood here. Tarix, Jabrix. Yeah. You three, come here. Cacing has gone crazy. - You two are brilliant. - What? - What? - Brilliant, clear as a diamond. I know what's the name of our motorcycle gang. The Tarix Jabrix. - Great, The Tarix Jabrix. - That's great. - Is that great? - Great. - Tarix Jabrix! - Tarix Jabrix! Dadang is ready to join Tarix Jabrix. - Are you serious, Dang? - Dadang. Dadang. Dadang. This evening we have to discuss it. We have to discuss about the plan of The Tarix Jabrix in the future. I'll write it down. Don't write down something like that. No, Cing. Why should we plan something, Cing? Just go with it. It can't be like that, Mul. We have to plan everything. We can't do it carelessly. Get down. - Dang. - What? Dang. Do you know that girl? - Which one? - The one who fell at the canteen. Her name is Callista, from social class. You like her? How come you know her? Of course. She had a crush one me once. What a playgroup. No, playboy. But, Mul, it seems she likes me. Because she seems smiling at me. Hey... Dumbass, are you looking for a fight? Sorry, Bon. I didn't mean it. Stop it. Bon, please forgive my friends. Watch it next time. Racun... - Racun... - Hey. Why are smoking at school? Give me you matches. - Get out. - Get out. No wonder people call you Cacing "Worm". It will become a dragon someday. Cing, Dadang is often bullied by Boni, isn't it? - Isn't that right, Cing? - Right, Cing. Should we smash him? No. We don't use violence. I have an idea. We use this. What is that for, Cing? Do you want to burn this school? Then where should I study? Only this school that accepted me, Cing - I don't want to burn this school. - So... Just watch... Ouch. Is your history note complete? Lend me yours. Hot. There's a fire, hot. One, two, three, four. - Our hero. - You are not on a detention, right? How is it, Cing? No... But, I have to meet the principal once a week... ... and clean his room. But I still can hang out with you all. - Tarix Jabrix. - Tarix Jabrix. What are you looking at, Cing? I'm looking at an angel comes down at the school. Where is the angel, Cing? If there is an angel, there will be Jaka Tarub, Cing? What a foxy lady. Where is she, Cing? The one behind the fence... ... with long hair. That is not a foxy lady, Cing. That is a box lady, Cing. Dumbass. That's not the one. Stop it. You guys just go ahead. I have something to do. Are you alone? How does it seem? There seems to be both of us. There are you and me. Callista, right? I'm Caca Sutarya. You can call me Cacing. You often suffered intestinal worms? Yes, I had it three times. That was a long time ago. I remember you. You're the one who burnt Boni's pants, right? That was me. Instead of waiting for the public transport,... ... do you want me to take you home? My pick up has just come. Thank you. I don't want to waste your time. Poor you. - Intestinal worms... - Sorry... Who are they? They are The Smokers. Big motorcycle gang, rich kids. Okay, bro. Yesterday we won against a famous gang. The one who was said to be the king of this road. Road Devils. Short track. Long track. - We won. - Yeah! Yeah, get your spirit up. So there is no king of the road anymore. - Then who is still here? - Smokers. - Who is still here? - Smokers. God of the road. Smokers. - You're late. - Sorry, Boss. I had to pick up your sister. Come down. Be careful. Where is your jacket? Jacket? I don't bring jacket. Here, so that you don't catch a cold... ... and so that your uniform is not shown. Don't embarrass us. - Thank you, brother. - Okay. One more, brothers. Our name is now even more well-known. Remember... ... the taller a tree grows,... ... the harder the wind blows it. That means more gangs will try to take us down. That means... - We have to increase our power. - Yeah! Now, I will introduce you to someone. Who is he? Yeah! Martin. - The Smokers. - Smokers! "Sugema Motorcycle Workshop" Moron. If you want to drop it, then drop it all. These, too. Drop them all. This one as well, drop it all. Then we can call it a good job, moron! - Sorry, Sir. - Drop it, okay? - Sorry, Sir. - That's right. Good afternoon, Sir. Is Mr Rohim here? Mr Rohim Sugema.

I want to discuss about the future of The Tarix Jabrix. But, before that, I want to know... ... is there any of you who didn't want to join... ... The Tarix Jabrix gang? If there is any of you who objects, we should disband it. What do you mean, Cing? What I mean is... ... if there is any of you reluctant to join The Tarix Jabrix gang... ... that means, we should disband it. It's just five of us anyway. Done, Cing. Continue. So, you all agree? So, here's the thing. The Tarix Jabrix... ... we now have to make it well-known. We have to promote The Tarix Jabrix. But, how we do it must be cool. Anyone has an idea? Here. - What is it? - Our ideas. - Our ideas, Cing. - Our ideas. Pictures of our gang's logo. Snake. Scary. This one is okay. It's okay. - Okay? - It's like a hair salon logo, Cing. That's the point, Mul. With this logo, people will easily remember. We will be easily known. Right? Okay, Cing. How about this? Because our name is The Tarix Jabrix,... ... so the logo is superhero riding a motorcycle. And his hair unravel behind his head. You mean like a long-haired Superman? - That's right. - That's right. - That's great. - Cool? Right? So, The Tarix Jabrix is like a superhero. Helping the weak and defending the rights.

Let us take a breath. I asked you before, but no one answered. I don't know! We don't know where is Dadang either, Cing. All we know is he was the last one going. But, you two come together. Why did you leave Dadang behind? Don't blame others. You're the one who went first. Stop it. Don't fight. What was happening? I don't know what you're talking about. May I know it? - That's Dadang. - That's Dadang. Dang! - Dang. - Dang, are you okay? I'm okay, Cing. - Dang, are you okay? - I'm okay. - At last you come. - At last you come. Dang, where were you? So Cing, when cops came, I freaked out. Then I hid in the alley. Then I saw one of the Smokers... ... threw out a suspicious package, Cing. - What package? - I don't know. But, you wrote it down, didn't you? Of course, I wrote it down. But, there was a crazy person. I freaked out and ran away. So the note? It's gone. I left it behind. It's okay. Alright...

Do you think I don't know where you go? You borrow Mang Yadi's motorcycle, right? Yes, but I didn't do anything. Mul... I don't like that you hang out without a purpose. And you must be racing, right? Look. You're such a mess. You already look like one of that gang members? From this day on, after school, straight to go home and study. Don't forget to drink milk. - Yes, Dad. - And don't borrow... ... Mang Yadi's motorcycle anymore. It's a pity Yadi has to order a taxibike. Stop this. Don't you see his tired face. Poor him... Take a shower and change your clothes. You always spoil him. Taking a bath... You never tell me to take a bath. Okay then, take a bath. Hurry. Mohtar! - A moment, Sir. - A moment! It's been five hours you fix that thing. Hey! You don't know me, do you? You don't know me, do you? - No, Sir. - It's okay. I know you, Sir. Sorry. Dadang, let me help you. Sorry May, I forget everything. - It's okay. - That's because I lost my note. Hey, you're talking about me? No, Sir. Hey! - Crazy. - Crazy. - You're crazy. - You're crazy. Mul, are you okay? It's okay, Cing. My dad is always like that. If only he was not my dad... Then... ... it's your fate, Mul. - One more, Sir. Not spicy. - Okay. - Let me borrow your newspaper. - Okay. Both of you are so quiet. - Here is the meatball. - Thank you. - Look at it, Cing! - What is it? - Dadang. - What? - Dadang is on the newspaper? - No, idiot. We have to go to his workshop. - Come on. Quick! - Where to, Cing? We have to go to the workshop, quick. Okay! Go! - Yes, Sir. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Do you know him? Don't you know? That was Saiful Jamil. Let's go. Saiful Jamil? Be careful... Dang, it's bad. Dang, it's bad! Dang, look at this. Innalillahi, who died, Cing? Why innalillahi, Dang? No, this one. - Here it is, Dang. - Dang, that was Saiful Jamil, right? Saiful Jamil. - Serious. - Right? The one who sings Umpan. Dang, this is the thing you talked about, Dang. "Heroin Found On the Street Police Stopped A Gang's Fight" So what does it have something to do with me? Dang... - You were the one who told us. - Yes. That a Smokers member left something. - The thing he left was Heroin, Dang. - Heroin. Did I tell you that? Our time is not right. He must have forgotten it. What should we do? Astagfirullah. Kalista. We have to tell Kalista. Her brother is Smokers member. We have to let her know that inside the Smokers there's a drug user. I have to tell her. "Cacing Calling" - What is it, Cing? - Hello, Kal. Hello? Cing? Cacing? Astagfirullah. What is it, Cing? There is something I have to tell you. It's important, Kal. What do you want to say? You want to tell about yesterday's ruckus? - No... - Right? That's so long ago. Every motorcycle gang always causes a ruckus. That's not what I meant, honey. I mean, Kalista. It's about your brother, The Smokers, and drugs. What? Drugs? Cing, I know my brother well. He won't do drugs. I trust you... ... but this information is so important for you, Kal Okay, then... We meet at Dago Cafe at four o'clock this evening. - How about it? - Four o'clock at Dago Cafe? Okay. - Okay. Bye. - Bye, Kalista. Four o'clock at Dago Cafe. "Entrance" Good evening, Sir. Kal. Cing! - Cing. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Please, continue... I thought Kalista. - Hey. - Hello. - Hello, Kal. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello... Hello, Kalista. You've been waiting long time? Sorry, my motorcycle was broken down. It's always like that, isn't it? Your motor cycle is always broken. - What do you want to eat? - No, don't worry... Ciko, Coki, Dadang, Mul Der, just order something if you want it. Sweet ice tea. The money? It's always me... - Avocado juice. - Dadang? Iced coffee. - Kalista? - No, thank you. Ouch! So, what is the problem? It's about you and the Smokers. Me and Smokers? - What's the matter? - So here's the thing. We were riding on the street then. Suddenly there were The Smokers attacking us. Fortunately we can compete with their motorcycles. Suddenly, there were police officers. Then we were chased. The chase was so intense. That was crazy. You exaggerate things. So what is the point of your story? The point is The Smokers attacked us. Attacked you? But, you're alright, right? Please, have a drink. Come on. Where is the avocado juice? - Where is the sweet tea? - Your orders are out. - Just order sweet tea somewhere else. - It's Moroccan Tea. - For Tarix Jabrix. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! For Kalista. - Yes! - That's right! Here... Okay. That's enough. Let's continue. Where were we? - You were attacked. - Yes. Kal, when we were attacked,... ... suddenly the police came. We all ran away. But, Dadang saw something. One of The Smokers threw away a package in the sewer. What package? "Heroin Found On the Street Police Stopped A Gang's Fight" No way. I know The Smokers really well. Moreover, Max is my brother. I know, The Smokers often cause trouble. But, for drugs, I'm sure they're clean. They don't use drugs at all. But, Dadang saw it himself. Dang? - Is that true? - I don't know. I forgot. Did I ever tell you, Cing? - What! - What! Stop it. Don't make things up. No, it's true, Kal. Dadang saw it himself. It's just Dadang has a disease called post sleep lost memory syndrome. Like amnesia. So, if he sleeps he will forget what happened the day before. Stop it. Whatever it is,... ... I still don't believe The Smokers involve in drugs. It's okay if you don't believe it, but we still have to investigate it. That's right, Mul. Beside the information on this newspaper, why did they attack you? There must be another reason. There is a reason. We once asked Smokers kids... ... because Dadang was left behind. Accidentally my motorcycle splashed oil. Just because splashing oil? Not just that. The oil splashed that Smokers kid faces. So, just because of that? It seems it's not just that. They don't like it if I hang out with you. This must be because of Faldi. This time, it has something to do with me. I'll go. Kal, where are you going? - Kal! - Where are you going, Kal? You don't finish your drink, Kal? This is bad. We have to help Kalista. It's fine Cing, she is Max's sister. No, the information is from us. We have to help her. Let's hurry. - Where to, Cing? - Cing, I just sat down. If the police didn't come, Tarix Jabrix would be beaten up. They are not our class, Fad. No way, Max. We have to give that tacky gang a lesson. Especially the one named Cacing. I'll smash him. Isn't that right? - That's right. - Right. What's wrong? I want you to be honest with me, okay? You were the one who attacked Tarix Jabrix yesterday? What was the problem? They have embarrassed us. They deserved that. But, that's not the real problem, isn't it? There was another problem, right? We don't like you hanging out with that tacky gang. Especially, the one named Cacing. The one who doesn't like it is you. Don't interfere. Okay. One more thing, brother. When that happened yesterday... ... one of the Tarix Jabrix members saw... ... that one of the Smokers threw away something... ... and the police found it. You know what that was? That was heroin. Don't talk carelessly. You know I don't do that kind of thing. It's insane. They finally get to your head. Remember, we are here in peace. Hey, bastards! - Mul. - Get out all of you! Mul... Din. Why are they coming here? - Hey! - Where is he? What do you want here? Do you want to kill yourself? You want to play hero? Beat this one. Calm down. - Hey! - Give up! Hey! Coki! Coki! Cok! Let's do that later! Coki! Come on! - Coki! - Hey! If you want your friend to be safe, come back here! Or I'll burn your motorcycles! - Bring him! - Lift him up! Lift him up! We have to help Ciko. You remember, right? We have promised... ... to honor togetherness... ... and friendship. Mul. You may come, but keep your head cool. Okay, Cing. Come on. In the toilet? They are inhumane. Stupid! Clean your waste! Okay. Now I know. I have an idea. We have to distract that drugs user. By you luring them out, Cok. You go over there... ... when he sees you, just run away and hide. Mulder and I... ... will help Ciko. Dang, you wait here. You give us a signal if Max's boys come out. No way, Cing. Are you insane? Ciko and I are not alike. This is Bad idea. Even blind man knows they are not alike. Cok, you both are actually alike. You are identical twin. - Isn't that right, Mul? - Right, Cing. Alike. - Alike. - Alike. Okay. Just this once you say I look like Ciko. Good. Come on. Be careful, Cok. Cing. Are they really alike? Stop it, don't make a noise. I'm all alone? What is that? How can he escape? If Max knows this, I'll be dead. How dare he. Cik! Cik, wake up! Open it. Tarix Jabrix. You got the nerve. Life and death... ... are in God's hand. Not you. Do you surrender or are you reckless? Your mistake is so fatal. You have accused Smokers using drugs. I am assertive. I like fighting. I like racing. But, I don't do drugs. Understand? So now, apologize to us. Kiss our toes... ... you dog. Boss, the captive escaped... ... and then I chased him. I got him again, Boss. What should we do to him, Boss? Are you blind? The one you catch is his twin, stupid. Put him there. Relax, Boss. After they kiss our toes,... ... let's take off all of their clothes. Shut up. What are you doing? - Brother... - Stop it. Stop it. Calm down. Take care of her. Okay, Max. If there is one of your gang who uses drugs,... ... you must let us go. But, if your gang is clean... ... not only we will kiss your toes... ... but we also will lick your feet. Okay. I appreciate sportsmanship. And I like someone who have nerve. He wants to prove... ... who uses drugs among us. If there is one,... ... we will apologize. You may go. But... ... if there is none of us... ... not only you kiss our toes... ... but also lick the whole feet. Yeah! Mul. What are you doing? Start from you. I choose him. Hey, just kiss my shoes. That is not the deal. Take it off! Take it off. Hey. Take it off. - Boss, why not him first? - I want you. Quick, take it off. He can only push around, Cik. The other one too. The other one. Take it off! Take it off! Boss. I'm sorry, Boss. Boss, I'm sorry. Boss. Boss. Gosh. Boss. Sorry, Boss... - Bring him! - Sorry, Boss! - Bring him to the police station. - Bring him! From this day on... ... Tarix Jabrix... ... Smokers... ... we're brothers. - Brother, man. - Brother. Brother. It seems Valdin still have a problem with Cacing. That's your personal problem, solve it yourselves. What? You're the one who tell me to date him. Okay. Valdin. Cacing. Okay. Tomorrow you have to prove who deserves my sister... ... by racing. If Valdin loses the race,... ... he has to give his motorcycles to you... ... and must go away from my sister anymore. Okay. If Cacing loses the race,... ... his motor will be burnt or thrown away. Because Valdin wouldn't want a motorcycle like that. - Okay. - Deal? Deal. Okay. Okay, Max. If Cacing loses,... ... you can burn his motorcycle or skin him. You're crazy, Mul. But, he still can date Callista, right? If my sister wants him, why not? Yes! How can I win against Valdin's big motorcycles? Even Valentino Rossi will lose, if he rides this motorcycle. Cing, just calm down. I'm here, Dadang's modification. Everything will be okay, Cing. That's right. - Tarix Jabrix! - Tarix Jabrix! Mul, push it. Tarix Jabrix! Cing. Ride this... ... while my dad is in Jakarta. Are you sure I can win with this motorcycle? I'm sure! Leave it to me. Dadang's modification. Okay. Let's do it now. - From where, Dang? - My notebook is gone, Cing. What notebook do you mean, Dang? I have my dad's secret formula composition calculation in there. There's also other notes. All of them? So you can't fix it? I'm doomed. Where is Mulder? It's late, but he's not home yet. This house is just like a transit for him. He said he was doing task in his friend's house. Task? Is he a soldier? Excuse me, Mam. There is important guest who wants to meet you. Important guest? Police, Sir. - Police? - Yes. How come you know that it's the police? He's wearing a uniform. Elementary school kids wearing uniform are not called police. Are you the mother of Mulyana Derajat? Yes, I'm his mother. No. Your son is alright. It has nothing to do with traffic accident... Sorry, Sir. We, as the parents, want to apologize. My son must have something to do with that motorcycle things, right? I always warn him... ... not to ride a motorcycle. That's dangerous, Sir. If you have to, just catch and lock him up. So that he is chary. But, we come here to appreciate Mulyana, Sir. Because he has helped us, the police, to catch... - ...a drugs user and dealer. - Cep. Our reason coming here... ... is to ask the parents' permission... ... to allow Mulyana to testify in court. That's how it is... ... if parents always underestimate their child. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. What are you guys doing? Then... ... what are you doing here at night? I left my bag. It's your bag? Do you want to help me? What's wrong? Tomorrow we, Tarix Jabrix, represented by Cacing... ... are challenged to race by The Smokers. Then we have to modify this motorcycle. And Dadang's notebook is gone, May. It seems that it's just you who can help us. So, please help us. For Tarix Jabrix, I'm ready. - Ouch. - Help me. It's great, Dang. This is what we call a motorcycle! This is what we call a motorcycle instead of yellow junk. Damn you. I must win riding this. - Of course. - That's right. Dang, how can I turn it on? Try this. Do it again. - Go. - Pull the throttle. Try it again. - Pull the throttle, okay. - Okay. What a nice bike. Nice! Awesome! Oh God! What happened? - Why is it broken. - What should we do, May? It will take long to fix it, Dadang. - I'm doomed. - It's almost the time. No way. No. Why does The Smokers come here? Smokers? Smokers? What is he doing? - Smokers. - That... That is Mulder. Mulder! Assalamualaikum! Hello! Excuse me. - Cal. - Are your ready? Wish me luck, Cal. - Do your best. - Okay. You really are my savior, Mul. Cing, I lend this motorcycle not for you,... ... but for... - Tarix Jabrix! - Tarix Jabrix! Then I won't let you down. - Yes! - Me, too. Mul. Lend me your helmet. It doesn't match. Nobody will notice it. How to turn it on, Mul? You clownish. That's great. Hey, you! Success. Okay. Start, finish line, and start... ... turn around there, just one lap. One lap. Okay, start. Ready? Dang... ... judging from its noise,... ... Valdin's motor must use head oversize. - How about it, brother? - That must be original. It's bad, May. On a straight track like this, he'll win. No... If only we use that on Mulder's motorcycle. What's that name again? That expensive gas accelerator? NOS. Yes, NOS. Nitrous Oxide System. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm Mahendra. - Mayang. They call me Max. My motorcycle is great. Tarix Jabrix! Cing, congratulation. Tarix... ... Jabrix! So... ... from that day on, The Tarix Jabrix... ... become a considered motorcycle gang. That's right. Okay. Then, get ready. Stand up steadily. We will take your pictures for a magazine cover. - Magazine. - Rig. Come on. Steady. Spirit up. It's for a cover. Tarix Jabrix! "The Tarix Jabrix From Zero To Hero" "Tacky, but let's go!" "Best Motorcycle Modification 2008 Race Motorcycle Review" Brik... Jabrik! Jabrik!
