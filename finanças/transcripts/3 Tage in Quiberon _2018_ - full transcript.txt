Look! It's flying! Oh, you did it! Great! Well done! 3 DAYS IN QUIBERON Thank you. - Have a nice stay. 3 p.m.? Let me see. Just give me a second. Hello, Madame. How can I help you? Ah, yes. Thank you. - You're welcome. Romy? Romy? It's me. Romy? Hilde? Go back to sleep. I'll find my room and come back later. No, no, no! Come on in. Hilde... I... I'm so glad you're here! I think... I only just fell asleep. I couldn't sleep... Could you pass the water? You're here! Come here. I brought you something. So you don't forget home sweet home. A good old sausage! And Mozartkugel pralines! They don't let you eat or drink anything here... Or smoke or smile... nothing. Really? No creme fraiche? No salty butter, no baguettes? No white wine? Not for me. 32The Criterion Channel will launch April 8 in the U.S. and Canada 00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,932 I'm here to get sober... Since when are you so obedient? You can outact anyone, sober or not. Exactly! Don't worry, I'm far from obedient. How are you doing? Now I'm better. Look! Schneider's diet: no salt, no sugar, no butler, no oil, no cream and... no bread. You call that white mush dinner? It's disgusting. - I'm so sorry, sir. Shall I take it back? Do you have no shame? Am I paying hundreds of francs for this? Some chicken broth instead, perhaps? - What? Are you kidding? I'm the head chef, sir. He's complaining. Now listen... - What this white mush? It's all horrible and wrinkly! I've had it! I'm hungry! Hello, ladies. - Hello. But... what's this? The dieting cooks came up with it. You can mix it together. Apparently it's quite tasty. Why not mix it in the kitchen? - Apparently... the guests feel like they're cooking or something. The vegetables make you chew at least. You don't have to eat it. There's a restaurant on the other side of the hotel that serves normal, fatty food. I've finally made it to France. Bring on the fromage blanc! Can I not have an orange juice? - Personally, I'd be the first to let you. However, fruit juice with lots of sugar is a stimulant. Very well. Thanks. You're really sticking to it. I'm very impressed. Ever done this for a film before? - It's not for the film. It's for David. I want to show him he can rely on me. Why's that? He doesn't want to live with me anymore. He wants to live with his step family. And that's out of the question. You're his mother. Are they crazy? He said that's what he wants. And he's 14 now. I can't tell him what to do anymore. He rides a motorbike, drives fast cars. They drove down Route 66. His eyes light up when he talks about it. Far more exciting than living with me. I'm losing him. - No, he loves you. He's just a 14-year-old boy. Of course he'd rather speed through the desert than hang out on film sets. He doesn't need me. - Of course he does. You're his mother and you always will be. Look what you're doing for him now. You really think so? - Yes. Want to get in? It's nice, huh? - Yes, that feels nice. Your skin is always so while. Thanks a lot. - No, it's beautiful. Like porcelain. So? Have you met someone? No. - Oh, come on! Well, Dionysus. - Who? -Dionysus. No, someone... someone sent in a bas-relief from Corfu to the atelier. 1060 centimetres by 770 centimetres. It's a mythological scene. Dionysus. Surrounded by dancing nymphs and centaurs. You'd love it! The god of wine, intoxication and ecstasy... Not bad! And? - Three quarters of it is damaged. I've been working on it for almost two months now. It took me weeks just to restore his neck, his chest, his armpits and his arm. He's going to be beautiful. And if you spend 8 hours a day, week after week, examining and analysing a lace and a body, shaping it with your own hands... I know... I'm a bit of a weirdo. Not at all. - Oh, I am. No. Every day with the same man: handsome, always there and mute. What's not to like? - That's what I thought too. Why look for another man when I have Dionysus? Exactly! Romy! Yes? Oh, really? No, that's fine. Tell them I'll meet them at reception. Yes, thank you. Who was that? - Two journalists are here. To do an interview and photo session. Here? - Yes. I like the photographer, so I said yes. They're from Stern Magazine. Is it wise to do an interview right now, especially with the German press? I'm going to my room to get changed. You'll come, won't you? I'm not going alone. See you in a bit. How about I write an article called "Waiting for Romy". About journalists waiting for Romy Schneider who never turns up. Excuse me... - Yes? What's that? - It's Monday's cocktail. I'd like one too. - Okay. Me too. - There you go. -Thank you. Thank you. - You're welcome. Le beau. - La belle! Wonderful! Hello. - Hello. Michael Jürgs. Hello. Hilde Fritsch, a friend of Romy's. Robert Lebeck. - Michael Jürgs. From Stern? Let's do the interview right away. Sure. - Sure. Shall I get us a room then? - Yes, do that. Let's go outside for a minute. - Okay, I'll just get my things. Romy! You're looking good. It's too dark out here for you to see that. It's the largest room they've got. Stern reserved the suite for tomorrow. Shall I take your coal? Give it here. - Thanks. Will you take my glasses? Shall we begin? Mrs Schneider... How are you? Fine, just fine. Where are you from? - Hamburg. Hamburg? I know Hamburg well. What do think of German politics? - Domestic or foreign? Either. - Not much. Are you married? - Yes. Children? - A son. I have a son too. Do you see him a lot? I try to take him to school and to get home early enough to put him to bed. Do you manage it? - Rarely. Why? I often work late into the night. - Is it worth it? I don't know. I love my family. But I also like my work. Then it's the opposite: you like your family and love your work. Mrs Schneider, are you interviewing me now? I have to know who I'm dealing with. And what about you? Do you love your work more than your family? Are we starting? Are you ready, Bob? - Start. I'll take the photos afterwards. Mrs Schneider, you are a source of public scandal and excitement. Every time something happens in your life: a miscarriage, a divorce, a marriage or a film, the Sissi generation is up in arms demanding their pure little empress back. To some, you're a saint who's got a raw deal out of life. To others, you're a whore. I'm not Sissi. She's a 15-year-old character I once played. I can't help it it people still haven't got that. I'm Romy Schneider and I'm sick of talking about it. It doesn't define me. - You want to reinvent yourself? Maybe I'll go back to the theatre. Then you can see if I'm Sissi or not. Call me. I'll get you tickets. But your whole reputation is based on the Sissi role. No one in Germany gives two hoots about the parts you play today. You're known for your scandals there. Does that bother you? I can't change that. Look, I'm an actress. It's all I know. I don't care about the gossip and the rumours about me. I just want to work and be left in peace. - But you are... And I'm not the women I play in my films. That's not how I act in real life. The roles I play are not who I am. The parts I'm offered in France are exactly what I want to play. But they also have nothing to do with who I am as a person. Did you steal away from Germany to France to play those parts? Steal away? I didn't steal away. I left. And knew exactly what I was doing. Or was it because you knew you'd never be recognised 217al 00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,493 as a serious actress at home in Germany? I don't know. I don't know. I... I don't know. You ran away to France with charmer extraordinaire Alain Delon. How did that come about? I wanted to live. We were very much in love... And we wanted to be together. Alain was shooting and we travelled together. We were young and I was free at last. Why the sudden desire to break free? You know... I left school when I was 14 to shoot my first film. From then on, I was surrounded by adults telling me what to do. No relaxing or going out with friends. Just one film after the other. I wanted to live at last! And I was too young for what happened after that. And I was too obedient. Far too obedient. One day at Madrid airport, thousands of people were waiting to welcome me. The crowd almost crushed me. I was scared, really scared. My mother was standing behind me and said, "Come on, smile!" Do you think you had to compensate for your mother's lack of fame? To give her that fame? Yes, that's possible. Today, I can see that it all went too far. Way too far. Why are you surprised when German journalists still try and portray you as a naive and impulsive little girl? Because it's not true anymore. They don't know me. I haven't done an interview in years. I go to a spa: brain surgery, they say. I tell a writer I like him on a talk show: I've proposed to him, they write. But you don't go to jail for verbal rape. But you do know your mother likes talking to the press. Especially about you. I love my mother. She was good to me... in her own way. I imagine she must get a certain fee for every interview about you, right? My mother! Not everyone can claim that Hitler had a crush on their mother. That's for sure! The worst part is: she didn't really have an opinion at all. She held her tongue in the Third Reich and then forgot it all. Would you say you let yourself be manipulated by your mother? And by your directors? And ultimately by the men in your life? Apparently, your last husband... I won't talk about him or the divorce. - Apparently... I just want to take back control over my life. Do you know that we've met before? No, I don't think so. We have. - Where? Was it 16 April or 17 April 1979? At any rate, one or two days... after your ex-husband Harry Meyen hanged himself in his flat. I saw you in the basement car park of Meyen's flat, which is also Stern's basement car park. Your lawyers hid you from the tabloid press and slipped you into a car to take you to Meyen's funeral. You were there? Yes, I was there. I park my car there every morning. But you didn't see me. Did your son know at that point? How do you do that? How do you tell your son that his father's hanged himself? Did you know Harry well? A little. We'd bump into each other on the walkway between Stern and his flat and have a chat. He spoke very fondly of you. Really? I can't stop thinking: "Could I have done more?" Depression is a serious illness. There's not much you can do. Didn't you... take his suicidal feelings seriously? Let's stop there and carry on tomorrow. Let's get some fresh air. - Good idea. Great, let's go. You were there? When they hid Romy in the car? I wasn't far away. In the office. But my car was there. And Herbert told me everything. I'm so happy you're here! I was wasting away in that hotel. Bob! Where are you going? Everything's shut! Come on! Something must be open by the harbour. Good evening. No, no, no! Sorry, we have a private function today. Just a little glass, please. Of course! I didn't recognise you, Mrs Schneider. Please come in. - Thank you. It was your headscarf. Take a seat. - Thank you. Would you like a drink? - Champagne, if you have some. Champagne! Of course! My dear, could you bring our guests some champagne and glasses? Nice place. Have you been here before? No, I haven't. - It's great they're still open. That's wonderful! Thank you! Thank you. It's so great you're all here! - Cheers! Cheers! You're filming in Berlin soon? - Yes, a great project! Do you know "The Passerby" by Joseph Kessel? Let me guess. Is it a book? I don't read much. I read it and thought: that has to be a film. I've found a great producer. And I get to play two different women. Two women at the same time. One role isn't enough anymore? Exactly! If you need a challenge, you should play a monk, right? Now Hilde... I used to be crazy about Hilde's brother, but it was no use. He only had eyes for this rockabilly chick. A rockabilly in Salzburg? - Yes, Franziska Stadler from Glanegg! Oh, how I hated her! - She didn't like her one bit! Take a photo of us. - Micha... Get in the photo! Good evening. - Are you a photographer? -Yes. Gwenael, go and get some tart for the guests. Oh, thanks. A drink? - A glass of red. Let's take a photo of the guys together. Oh, sorry! - Oh, don't worry about it! It's the leftovers from the wedding. My uncle said to bring it over. How nice of him. What's your name? - Gwenael. Gwenael! What a nice name. Come and join us. Who got married? - My cousin. My uncle's daughter. Do you like her? - Yes, she's really nice. Hello, I'm Gwenael's older brother. Good evening. And what's your name? - Mourad. Mourad... How did you end up on those crutches? I broke my ankle playing basketball. He knows a girl who adores you. Really? - Yes. She has photos of you stuck all over her exercise books. She even said she'd prefer you to her own mother. And you like this girl, right? Yes, but she doesn't like me that much. But if I got her your autograph, she might like me a bit more. Get me a piece of paper and a pen. Aude, can you give me a piece of paper and a pen? Here you go... Thanks. There you go. - What's her name? Bénédicte. “Béné in short." With a little heart. - A little heart? Of course. There you go. - Thanks. My pleasure. Have a nice evening. - You too. You have a way with young people. - Not always. At a news stand yesterday I saw the front page of an incredibly intellectual paper: "Romy is pregnant. But who's the father?" I wondered how you deal with it when your own kids read that stuff. The worst thing is: I used to find it funny, but now it just tires me. You have to face the truth: journalists are sharks. Yes, it would seem so. That's why I'm wondering how I ended up here at this table with a journalist. Well, at least you chose one of the better sharks. But seriously, I was trying to imagine how I'd react as a father. My little girl can't read yet. And my son... he just looks at me all confused. And every time I assure him that it's all just lies. But it's still taken its toll. I have a question, Mrs Schneider. Call me Romy if you like. Mrs Schneider, why not use our interview tomorrow to set a few things straight? You don't want to be on first name terms. Romy, why not use our interview tomorrow to set a few things straight? I've been trying for years. Sorry to say this, but... Why not use the press to your advantage rather than fight it? Turn the tables. Then your son will read things you want him to know about you. Your friend is a lot of fun! Hilde? Hilde's wonderful. I'm thirsty! - That's what I like to hear! Hilde, stop flirting with the bar! Get over here! What are you doing? Getting water. - Are you joking? We have champagne! Excuse me... are you Madame Sissi? No, I'm Romy Schneider. Great! I adore you! Can I get you a drink? - Of course. Take a seat. The drink's on me. Gwen, get me a glass! Do you live in the area? Sometimes here, sometimes there. I don't like putting roots down. Thanks. I go wherever my poems are welcome. You're a poet? - Yes... Yes, I'm a... poet. What kind of poems? I cut my breath on carbon paper I cut the anchors The anchors and then my blood I cut out pieces of glass Turned them into glass dust Then I rubbed it over my body It covers my face And it's deep in my heart So that I never forget So that no one can erase the fact That I'm mad about you I, I... Oh, damn... I've forgotten the rest. It's about paradise... Shit! But it's wonderful. You're really talented. I didn't write it. It's by Edith, a friend of mine who comes from this area. That's why I can't remember it. - That doesn't matter. I... You have the passion... to recite it. Thank you. I die in the heart of an Inuit Love kills me... Oh, damn! I'll show you something else. It looks like a snail. Wrong! - Damn... Pocket bagpipes. That's not true! - It is. Champagne! Drink, Hilde! To you too, my dear. I give up. I can't play it at all. - Give it here. You play, Sissi! - Oh, stop it! Okay, I'm stopping! Oh no! We need something with a bit more oomph. Don't you have anything more fun? Where are your tapes, Uncle? - No. -Oh, go on... Uncle! -If you're sure... The tapes! Take this. I'll lake care of it. What have you got there? What's that one? That's good. - Yes! It's nature and the magic it encapsulates. You can't just compare it to any old thing. It's... It's not theoretical. - Not at all. You have to experience it. We've experienced it. Michael, we've experienced it. Us two, we've experienced it. Le beau! My love! Micha, lake a photo of me and Romy. Now it's our turn. Go on, take another one! You two are sweet. - Your hands are made to play the piano. Or to caress women or... Anything left to drink? What happened... Where's it all gone? Hang on. I'll get some more. Hi there. Hello? Let's go. You've had enough to drink. Why are you telling him all that stuff? He'll print it all! You can't trust him. He's a journalist. Romy, please. Please, let's go now. Good night. - Good night. Can't you walk straight? - I am! I'm off to bed, Romy. See you tomorrow. Hilde, you can't do that. Please stay with me. - No, I'm tired. I'm going to bed. - Hilde... Please don't go. I can't be on my own. Okay, I'll slay. I have to call David. - What? To say I'm sorry. To say it was all just a big misunderstanding. That won't help, Romy. You'll wake him up. It's too early. Call him later. Now let's go to bed. Stop it. Let's go to bed. Okay... Can't you sleep without them? I'm here. Taking pills after all you had to drink? Please don't. Mrs Schneider? - Yes? It's time for your treatment. - Okay. I'm coming. Now please turn around, Mrs Schneider. Turn around. Mrs Schneider, please turn around. Turn around. So, Mrs Schneider, how are you feeling after four days of rest, treatments and dieting? You're looking rather peaky. I'm hungry. Okay. I have something for you. Because I like you. But no snacking between meals otherwise. It's normal for you to feel bad. You're cleansing your body. You haven't had a drop of alcohol for four days. You're taking no medication, eating healthy food... It's just a matter of time. Where did you get that croissant? All they have here are rusk biscuits and fruit. I got it in town. So? How's the hangover? I couldn't sleep after all that champagne. I didn't drink that much. Where did you and Romy meet? Do you really think I'd tell you anything? You take yourself seriously, huh? Do you think Stern readers really care about Romy Schneider's kindergarten friend? Exactly. "You scare me. I scare myself. Forget me. But don't forget to say good night." That was the message you slid under my door. Did I? You don't remember our first night? I do remember the night, but not the message. I still have it. It was a nice night. Although we didn't make love. Although... If I'm honest, I was afraid. Afraid of what would happen... Dont act all innocent! I won't bite you, you know? But I love biting. Bite away! Yesterday was wonderful. I haven't had that much fun in ages. I have. The next day, I always wonder what the point of it all was. Don't do it so often then. I wish we were done already. With the interview? I'll go on ahead. Romy? Hilde. - You okay? There was post for you at reception. Tax adviser, inland revenue. And one from the lawyer. I can't deal with that now. Why don't we do something else? Just spend the day together? You gave them an interview yesterday already. Ready? How do you do? - How do you do? Hello. - Hello. Thank you. Here you go. - Thanks. Come a little closer. Don't be shy. Romy, would you sit over there? Okay. Are you ready? Mrs Schneider... Are you bankrupt? - Do I look like I am? Your fees for Sissi alone would be... - We discussed Sissi already. You've made over 50 films. Where's all the money gone? Your mother and stepfather have made a mint with you, huh? I've said it 100 times: I was a child! For one more Sissi film alone... - For the last time: I haven't been Sissi for years and never was. I'm an unhappy, 42-year-old woman and my name is Romy Schneider. Unhappy? - Yes. Ever wondered what a normal life would be like? Have you never had a man who said, "Quit the show business"? No, I've never been with a man like that. It's what I've always wanted. Always. A completely ordinary life. A daily routine. Al the moment I'm trying... and not just in my professional life... to free myself from a straight jacket. But getting out of this rat race alone... it's... difficult. I can't live without my work. I need to work less to find some peace, but I never manage it. And I need to make films or I go crazy. Does shooting films really keep you sane? I don't know. I need my work. And I want to be with my children, who I love a lot. I... I still haven't worked out how to juggle the two things properly. That's why I often feel so lousy. All you have to say is, "I don't want to make this film." Oh, it's that easy, is it? And what should I do instead? Take a break. Get off the merry-go-round if it's all so hard. I can't! I need to earn money. You really can't live off what you've earned? It's all gone. I don't know where it went. I was never good with money. I know one thing: it wasn't me who spent most of the money. And there's none left? - No! Nothing. I have nothing left. Happy now? Your private life is full of drama. The men at your side often let you down. Did you ever wish your father had been there to protect you? My father... He was a handsome man. He liked laughing and had a hearty laugh. Sometimes I'd climb into his wardrobe. My mother kept his things after he'd left. I could smell him. It was like... he was holding me tight in his arms. I felt safe there. Even though he'd left you both. Would your life be different if he'd stuck around? He couldn't cope with the father role. It was too much for him. But he was there sometimes. We made a film together once. But that's not enough, is it? For this? One time when I was little, he galloped through the forest with me like a horse. I sat on his shoulders and had to make sure that the leaves and branches didn't hit us in the face. I laughed so much I nearly fell off. It was wonderful. The strange thing is... I don't know anymore if it really happened... Maybe I've made it all up. Or was it a scene from a film? Or a book I read. I don't know... I don't know if it's really true. I don't know if it really happened. Now the pattern's repeating itself... That's enough. Let's go. Leave it. - Are you serious? This isn't an interview. It's manipulation! You think it's okay? You know they'll print it all, right? Everything! You know they'll print it all, right? Everything! Sure, but what's the problem? "I'm an unhappy, drunk, My name's Romy Schneider and I let prying journalists take advantage of me. And then I complain about it because I feel so lousy!" What's your problem, Hilde? - Please, just stop the interview. I'll see you later. Okay. Okay. I just have to make one more film. And then I'll take a break. I'll spend some time with my children. Think you'll manage it this time? I miss them. I want to have them close to me. I just feel so weak at the moment. Why do you doubt your own strength? You already left everything behind you when you left for France? And what's become of me? Europe's biggest female film star. I'm sorry to put it so simply, but: I'm sorry to put it so simply, but: my life could have turned out a whole lot better. You're feeling down right now. And it's understandable considering your situation. But it will pass. Who do you go to when you're feeling bad? A person I can call at 3 a.m. And I'd do the same for them. But there aren't many of them. - You want to settle some scores, huh? No. It's not about that. I have to learn to defend myself. And I want to be left in peace. And my children will stay with me. But if you're as "broken" as you say you are, how can you look after someone else? Oh, man! Just ask your questions and keep your comments to yourself! You're either shy and very introverted, or you show yourself to the whole world. What's it like to live in extremes? Not good. You just have to keep on living. Or keep on going crazy. Incredible... What a headline! - Yes: "A cut above the rest." In caps. In big capitals. Come on, Bob. Marry her then. Protect her like all the other guys. - Stop it, Michael. Protect her like all the other guys. - St0p it, Michael. You're no better. I saw you use the Lebeck method in the bar yesterday. Suck up to the locals, let the guy who's most interested in technology use your camera a bit. And after that you can take as many photos as you like... That's manipulation. But that's okay. It's our job. You only care because you have a crush. Thank you. - You're welcome. Can I help you? - No, thanks. Hello, it's Jürgs. I just wanted to let you know about the interview with Romy Schneider. We just finished and it... went incredibly well. Yes. I don't think she's ever revealed so much to a journalist as she did today. Sorry, Madame. Hello. What are you doing here? I'm leaving. Why did you even come here? - I'm wondering that myself. Pack your case if it's so awful then. - I already have. Why did you ask me to come? - I wanted to spend time with you. What? - What a load of rubbish. How will you get David back like that? What would you know? You don't even have a man! Have some kids and then you can tell me how to be a good mother! Yes? Okay. It's David. - Talk to him then. Just talk to him. Hello? Hello, David. No, it's Hilde. How are you? Where are you? Your mum's gone for a walk on the beach. I'll tell her you called. And you were in the U.S., right? WOW! Oh, that sounds amazing! Yes, we're spending some time together. It's really nice here. Okay, I'll get your mum to call you back. I hope we see each other soon. Bye, David. Bye. Just go, please. Hilde? Are you leaving? Where's Romy? - She must be in her room. Think she's all right? Shall we call her? That's strange. Let's go up. What? - She'll be back in a minute. Romy, wake up! Did you take something? Here you go. Leave me alone. I want to sleep. Okay. Sleeping pills, but she only took a few. My taxi's waiting. I'll stay. You just have to keep on living. Or keep on going crazy. Not good. You just have to keep on living. Or keep on going crazy. Are you alone? - No French. So? Didn't leave after all? May I? No, sorry. I just want to eat and go straight to bed. Ordered yet? Is it people in general you don't give a damn about or just women? I love women, especially my own. Oh, Hilde, come on. Where's your Austrian sense of humour? I'm leaving, okay? Good evening, Monsieur. I'll take Menu 3. - Very good. And for Madame? Something to drink? A bottle of... What would you like to drink? - Water. A bottle of Chablis, please. Very good, Monsieur. Thanks. Le beau. What are you doing here? - I'm keeping watch, la belle. Come to me. I'm so tired. I know. Just go back to sleep. The photos you took this morning must be awful. Not at all. Do you think I take any old shot? Don't you trust my eye? Of course I do. And I don't care how people see me. But seeing myself like that... that's unbearable. You were strong and brave today. I love that. Strong and brave. I don't agree. Robert... - Yes? I'm afraid of myself. Hold me. Fighter. - Okay. Take your trousers off! Where are your manners? At last! I thought you'd never ask! My lovely legs are longing for some admiration. There you go! That'll do... There. Now I can finally get some sleep. Who are you to ask Romy Schneider questions like that? Invading her private life. And you were making fun of tabloids! "Romy is pregnant. But who's the father?" You're just as bad! You'll do anything to sell papers. To sell millions of copies and keep your boss satisfied. And you're so self-satisfied yourself! Fascinating! Michael Jürgs. The journalist who finally managed to get Romy Schneider to reveal her deepest and most intimate feelings of despair... Not everyone is as lucky as you, Hilde. As you pointed out, I only get to shine with my... "manipulated" interview with Romy Schneider. You, on the other hand, get to be her friend. And the fact of the matter is: you use Romy to your advantage, just like I do, and I get that. You're neither especially pretty or charming, nor do you have any particular talent. But thanks to good old Romy, you are someone! And why not? It's nice here. In a 5-star hotel by the beach. And I'd say you've earned it too. I'm sure it's not easy being her friend. Thanks. - Lobster soup for you, sir. Enjoy. Moths! Quick! Kill them, le beau! They'll eat my cashmere jumpers! Know the joke about the moth? - No. A little moth heads off on its first flight. When it comes back, its father asks, "So, how was it?" "It was great! Everyone was clapping." David told me that one. What's wrong? I feel this terrible pain. Waves of guilt. Of course my kids feel abandoned and my son doesn't want to live with me. I hurt him, I disappointed him, I left him all alone... You didn't abandon your kids. - Of course not! You see. My mother abandoned me when I was four. Your mother abandoned you? - Yes. And I don't think she ever felt guilty about it. You have no reason to feel guilty. You go away because you have to work. So your kids can live the way they do. Cancel it all. Just tell them all to go to hell, Romy. You decide if you want to be with your kids. You decide, and you alone. I can't carry on like this! I don't know how to solve it all. It's your decision. Tell them to get lost. Can I get you something else? A cognac, please. No, thanks. I started out reporting on politics at the Münchner Abendzeitung. My dream was to write articles that would change the world. So why don't you write about politics? Because apparently I'm more talented at reporting on celebrities... Getting celebrities to air their dirty laundry. Yes. No. Romy really moved me this afternoon. Seeing her in that state... - She doesn't give a damn it you're moved! Everyone's moved by Romy! That's nothing special. Thanks. - You've just gone soft. Because of her charm and childish candour. Back at Stern, you'll be the proud journalist who brought Romy Schneider to her knees. Aren't you tired of protecting Romy? Can't you see she doesn't want your protection? Look, our friendship has nothing to do with show business. I've known her since we were kids. And yes, you're right. I'm trying to protect her because... she's in a really bad way. You understand? I thought it was Romy. - Why? Isn't Romy here? - No. I just woke up and she's gone. When did you last see her? - In the night. She wasn't feeling so good, but she was calm. Maybe she's in a treatment. - No. I think she went out a while ago. That's Romy's jumper! - Yes, but I'm cold. Let's go out and look for her. That way? Okay. Hey! What are you doing here? - I can't sleep in that hotel. Have you seen Romy? Why? - Just answer the question! She was down by the rocks. Maybe she's still there. It didn't look like she wanted to talk. There. There she is. - Where? There you are! We were looking for you. You didn't leave then? - No. Did I snore that badly? Do you like these rocks? I do. - Nice, aren't they? Yes. Let's take some photos. Here? - Yes. Really? - Yes. Great. I'll just get my camera. - Do that. I'll wait here. I'm sorry. For how I treated you yesterday. I know it was shitty. I'll lose you ill carry on like that. Forgive me, please. Give me your coat. Great! Come on! Romy... did you hurt yourself? Shit... - Romy... Shit! - Is it your foot? Hang on... - It can't be that bad. Well, it certainly hurts like hell. Okay... - Damn! Is that okay? - Yes. Well, what do you want me to do? Yes, it's true. He said it's broken. Forget the shoot. I'll still have the cast in three weeks. I know it's crap, but we'll have to postpone it for a few months. Just calm down! The insurance will cover it. No... You know very well you can't make this film without me. Yes, he's still there. He wants to speak to you. It's the producer. I'll put him on. Hello? This is Dr Morielte. Her ankle is broken. It's a bad fracture... I'll put her back on. It's no use. He's not interested in my diagnosis. Yes. Listen... Listen to me! I would love to make this film, but I can't do it now. Yes, I'm completely serious. Yes, I have to go now. I'll call you. Could you pass me the jumper? That's important. Could you light me a cigarette? About yesterday... We need to talk about the interview. - Why? You do realise what's in store for you if we print it? That's the least of my worries right now. I trust you. Why? I trust you because... Because you're here telling me this. Will you send me a photo of Dionysus when he's finished? Or you can come and visit us and I'll introduce you. But you know him already. Bye. - Bye, Romy. Bye, Hilde. - Bye. Bye now. Oh, Romy, what a shame. Sorry. I should've been more careful. Bye. - Bye. We can go now. Good bye! PARIS, A WEEK LATER My darling! Oh, I didn't catch you! Where are those two? Are they hiding? No, let's look for the sweets! Wait... Did he hide them? Sweetheart... that's for me. - No! I'm going to run away now. - No, don't run away! Don't run away! My little girl... It's so nice that you're here. - It is. I haven't left this flat since I got back from Quiberon. What's happened? - Why? I've never seen you so relaxed. But it was your idea. - What'? "Want to be with your kids? Make it happen." What do you mean? You mean the foot is... - It's broken! You heard the doctor. I've got Jürgs' interview with me. You can cross out what you don't like. He said he wants to publish an interview you're happy with. All right then. Show me. There you go. No... My mother doesn't need to read that. "Going crazy..." Tell him to publish it. Okay. I'M GOING TO KEEP ON LIVING, LIVING LIFE TO THE FULL! What's with the serious look? You're the most beautiful of all. And always will be. 3 DAYS IN QUIBERON Inspired by conversations with M. Jürgs and R. Lebeck, the Stern interview published on 23 April 1981 and Lebeck's photographs.
