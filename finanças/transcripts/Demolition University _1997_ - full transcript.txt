perimeter has been breached. Dismissed. Yes, security has been breached too soldier. alright, you two stay here and guard the door. That's it? This is enough? Trust me, it's plenty. Don't we need protective suits? Not if you're careful. Faddem, take this, give this to shalik. Momad, grab the other one. No! No! Please open the door! Open the door! Let him out! Let him out now! He's dead! He's dead! You can't do anything for him. It's a pretty mean shit huh? He's my friend. No, he was your friend. That guy should have worn a suit. get a grip Aladdin. His name is faddem.

Alright guys, settle down, settle down. Listen up! Williams. Williams! Go short! You're up slater, go deep. Geez! How ya doin'? Mmm.. It's been better. Maybe you should try ankle weights. Why don't you try a catcher's mit? Oh, thanks! Slater! You dickhead! You couldn't catch flies if you're covered in dog shit! Hey first man, you couldn't hit water even if you're in the middle of the ocean. If you get your fingers on the ball you might be able to catch it. Wait a sec, you're the quarterback. You're supposed to throw the ball to me not a mile over my head. I threw it where you're supposed to be. Alright, you're right, you're right, I'm sorry. I didn't know that I was supposed to be in the next state. You little pussy! Don't throw your arm out we need you man! The only thing that I'm gonna be throwing out is you! I've seen you throw, it's not so much of a threat. You son of a-- get off! Come on man, let it go! Alright bring it on Bruce, come on! Alright! Time's up boys. Everybody hit the showers. You got lucky you little prick. I'll catch up to you later. It's a date then. A great way to start my day. Hey Jenny, wait up, wait up. Got a minute? No. Late for physics. Slow down, slow down. I'll walk you. Walk me? Thanks, but I'm not a doberman. Oh really? Okay, what's up? Alright. Okay, here's the deal. Look, I was wondering if you have a date for the homecoming dance? Why? Are you taking a poll? Ouch! Gosh, you're not a doberman? Okay, okay, I deserve that, but before you say anything else... You should know that I a have rule about dating jocks... That's okay. So do I. I'm serious. Me too... I'll tell you what... I'll take a chance that I'll break my rule, if you break yours. Ooh, sorry I'm a compulsive rule follower. That could be a problem, but... You know technically... You know I'm not really a jock. I know, I've seen you play. Ouch! Wait a second, you are a jock. No, no, no, no, no... I'm a physics major. Ah! That athletic scholarship is the only way I could afford to come here, but because I'm not a boy and a football player, it only pays for half of my tuition. So... In between classes, track practice, and my part time job... I don't have much time for social life. Ooh besides... I think you already have a date. Hey, there he is. Hey what do you say? Yes? No? Yes... yes... yes...? Slater! You faggot! You stay right there. Ooh... I don't know... Let me think for a minute... Ooh, maybe...Let me think... I...I'll get back to you. Uhh... Alright, we'll go around and find him. He's around here somewhere, I know it. He can't be far, man. Single file people. Single file. Okay people let's go. We'll attendance on the bus. Come on. I told you I'd get back to you. I'm impressed, you're not dead. Are you impressed enough to go out with me? You would have to cure cancer and win a pulitzer for me to be that impressed. Man! You're a tough room. Alright, so... Where are we going? We're going to the water and power plant. You see it's not where I've chosen to take you on our first date, but it could work, it could work. You're impossible. Slater, you're in my seat. Mcguiness, take a seat. He's in my seat. There are plenty of others, just pick one, so we can get going. Are you in this class? No he's not. Yes, I am... You see... I was thinking about you know, declaring physics as my major and so the department told me I was allowed to sit on your class because they said your class was the best. I see. What luck huh? It looks like it's about to run out. Excuse me, excuse me... Me and my date are trying to have a private conversation, okay? Mr. McGuinness, could we at least try to act our age? Please. good morning gentleman, how can I help you? Hey, hey, wait, hold on! Who are you? What do you want? Shut up! You got a public address system here right? Yes, of course. Good! Get on it, gather everyone up. You got a hearing problem? I know I'm talking cause I recognize my voice. You uh... You dont understand. I can't just have everybody abandon their stations. We have systems here that have to be monitored constantly. No, it's you that doesn't understand. If you don't do what I say, this lovely young lady right here is gonna blow your brains all over that wall. Now, I know you heard me that time didn't you? Yeah. Yeah, I heard you. I'll do anything you say. I know you will. Attention all plant employees, attention all plant employees, please stop what you are doing immediately and report to section c. This is an emergency. Repeat, this is an emergency. All personnel, please report to section c immediately. They can't mean us. Todos los empleados... you think they mean us? He said everybody. Hello? Hello? Damn phone... Hey, why don't you... Uhm... You go downstairs and find out what's going on and I'll take care of things up here. I can... I can do it. You sure? Go... Go! Everyone, please settle down. Silencio por favor! I'll tell you. Just a second, as soon as everyone is settles. Tell us. Yeah, spit it out. That's right. thank you. Now, I suggest everyone sit down and be quiet. good morning. Good morning, plant director ramos is expecting us. I'm sorry, the plant is closed for the day. Closed? Look, can you please check your clipboard? We're from richfield university. Sorry, there are no civilians allowed. Come on Jenny, I asked you first. He did? Yeah, that's right. I'm faster than you on and off the field. I wouldn't brag out about your premature problem, if I was you. Screw you slater. I think you're both being a little premature here. I haven't agreed to go with the dance to either one of you. I understand, I understand. You need time to let Bruce down gently. Screw you, slater. You need a new catchphrase. I'm sorry the plant is closed for today. And I'm not leaving until I speak with director ramos. Wait here, please. We must not be on the a-list. Hey, check that out! Check what out loser? It looked like an ak-47. How will you know? My dad's a New York cop. Oh, so it makes you a gun expert? No. It's...I've done some shooting, alright? Aren't assault rifles illegal? Yes? What? Look, tell them we have a broken steam valve. What's going on? There's a bus load of college students at the front gate. Give me that. Speak! There is a certain professor Harris here who insists on speaking to the plant director. Alright, put him on. Professor Harris is a woman. A very pushy woman. Hello, Mr. Ramos? Yes, professor Harris? How can I help you? I arranged this trip with your regional manager-- uh huh... Over a month ago and he assured me... Uh huh... That we'll be given your full cooperation-- yes, I see. Okay. Hello, Mr. Ramos? Could you put the guard back on the line please? Thank you. Let them in, direct them to section c. Very good. Are you crazy? What do we need more hostages for? Well, number 1, until our plan is in full motion, I do not want to do anything to arouse any suspicions, and number 2, the younger the hostages are the less likely it will be that the authorities will try anything stupid. It's bad p.R. For the u.S government to be gunning down innocent college kids. It's beautiful! did you see that? There's a body hidden behind those trash cans. Maybe it's just Jimmy hoffa. Who? Come on, you're telling me you didn't see him? okay people... I don't need to remind you to conduct yourselves in an orderly fashion, do I? Excuse me, professor Harris... Yes? Look, I'm not sure how to tell you this but... Alright, here it is, look, I... I'm sure I saw a guy lying behind the garbage cans out there and he looked.. He looks sort of dead. You saw a body? That's right, only in his underwear. In his underwear? That's right, that's right. And you know the security guard, you know, I saw he had an ak-47 in that little room. Aha, an ak-47 assault rifle? That's right, that's right... What is your name again? Slater, Lenny slater... Slater... Lenny slater! Aren't you the young practical joker who parked coach asheville's new Cadillac in the middle of the gymnasium? That wasn't me okay, I swear. That's right! They couldn't a thing even though everyone knew he did it. Look Mr. Slater, I don't know quite what you are up to here, but I can assure you, you' are not gonna disrupt my class with your juvenile attempts at witticism. Look, I just think we should-- young man... I'm gonna ask you to remain on the bus while we conduct our tour. You can take your seat now. But wait a sec-- thank you! You're such a loser slater. I'm the one who parked coach's car in the gym. So where are your famous comebacks now, smartass! Alright people, let's go! The students have left the bus and are heading into the plant. Good. Keep your eye on 'em. Carver out. Okay, let's go! This is it! Are you prepared? I've been waiting for this my whole life! And I thought you've been waiting for me your whole life... Alright if anyone tries anything, kill them. It would be my pleasure. hey, what exactly does Mean? The literal translation is pig, but it is actually something far more unflattering than that. She's quite a gal. Where did you find her? She's my sister. Oh... I should have noticed the family resemblance. You both have the same machine guns, but she's got that extra pair of 38's. Hey! Don't get any funny ideas yankee! She will kill you in an instant if I tell her to. Relax, mo, ol' buddy, I didn't mean to disrespect. Hell, if my sister looked that good I'd keep her heavily armed too. You know what I mean? The name's momad. Faddem, Abdul, Aziz... Let's get to work! You trust me? I'd better. Alright... all we have to do is take this little bit back to your country and add water and we can make as much as we want. It's that concentrated? That's the beauty of this stuff. There's some special compound strain, multiplies itself in water. Once we drop this into the reservior, this whole place will be one big nerve gas oasis. Pumping death through the water taps to everyone in the city. Is there an antidote? Not once you've been infected. That's why the compound was rigged with a self-destruct firebomb. alright. And here is where the energy from the fossil fuel is converted into alternating electrical currents. In these generators is where the electromagnetic conduction occurs. Step this way please. We will be visiting the reclamation pits next and I want to remind you to all stay close together. This facility is a huge maze, and you can find yourself easily lost in its tunnels. What is it now, Bruce? I don't get it, why won't you come to homecoming dance with me? I told you, I'm busy. Yeah, yeah, I know... Your jobs, midterms... Yada, yada, yada. Oh well, not everybody can skate through on a full scholarship. Yeah, I know... So are we going to the dance or what? I don't get you guys. What part of no don't you understand? I know that no usually means maybe and maybe usually means yes. Ahh... Okay so, you think I'm just playing hard to get? I think your mind is telling you one thing and your body is telling you something else. Well, uh... Why don't you listen real closely to what my body is saying now... Ugh! Oh great, which way did they go? The electricity produced from the generators then goes through these... Oh, excuse me. Everyone into the pit! Wai-- wait, just... Just a minute. Do it now! What was that? What? It sounded like gunshots. Gunshots? The explosive will not destroy the virus? It's a concussion grenade, no flame, just smoke and shrapnel, enough to punch a hole in the case and send it to the bottom of the reservoir. Perfect! Faddem, I want you and Aziz to plant the rest of t he charges, set the timer for 5 hours. This must be it. Alpha 1 to hq, come in. Go ahead Alpha 1. Found a vehicle... Uh... It's by a gravel pit just off highway 45, maybe 10 miles north of route 22. Let's get an investigation unit out here, asap. Affirmative Alpha 1. Oh, and colonel... Yeah? The Pentagon suspects a collaborator, they're sending an FBI profiler to go over our personnel files. That figures. Alright, uh... Stall 'em as long as you can. Yes sir. Over and out. let's get this show on the road, huh? Right now! Hi, I have information about the explosion at fort Solomon, put me through the investigating officer please. Geswald, get away from there! son of a bitch! What? Catch you in a bad time? Who is this? Take a wild guess. I don't have time for games. Think... Persian Gulf, February 1991. Sergeant Max carver. I was hoping g2 would make you the pointman on this little mission. It's been a long time colonel. Not long enough. I figured you went up with the compound last night. Wishful thinking, huh? So sorry to disappoint you. Cut the crap carver. Have you got the goods or not? Well... First things first colonel, you should know I'm calling on behalf of the Iraqi nationalist regime. The inr? It was disbanded 2 years ago. We are a splinter group. We? You know, treason is still a capital offense sergeant. Well, you're the expert on betrayal, colonel. Do you wanna hear our demands? Or do I have to do something nasty? Alright, say what you have to say. We are in control of the richfield water and power plant... Unless kalmed farrukh is released immediately, we will drop the vx solution into the city's water supply. I don't even know where farrukh's being held. Don't insult me colonel, okay? Don't insult me. You think it's a coincidence we picked richfield? Alright, I'm gonna need some time. You got 4 hours to deliver him to the gates of the plant. 4 hours? Are you insane carver? No... No, just incredibly happy-go-lucky... Oh, and in case you're thinking of storming the facility, just bear in mind we have all the employees hostage as well as a group of local college students on a Really unfortunate field trip. You know what kinda red tape I'm gonna have to cut through to get a federal prisoner released from a maximum security penitentiary. Well, that sounds like a personal problem to me. Hey! It was nice talking to ya! Have a nice day colonel! Carver? Carver! Son of a bitch! What did he say? Well, you know, the usual. Don't be a stranger... Let's do lunch... I'll have my people call your people. let's go! are you sure you know where we're going Bruce? Uh-huh! Uh-- let's ask those guys. Max, will they comply with our demands? Maybe, maybe not. But then again, it doesn't really matter does it? Those guys had guns. Shit! We better find the others. Yeah. I'm all over that. Oh, shit man! I heard something, go check it out. one of them had on army fatigues. He's not the only one. So what? There's gotta be some logical reason for all this. Yeah, terrorists took over the plant. Bullshit! Wait, Lenny, this isn't some kind of a lab work practical joke, is it? I wish it was. Ugh, get off it slater. What are terrorist doing in richfield? Oh, shit! You are tripping dude! Hey! Yo! Excuse me? Oh god, don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hi. just chill out dude. I'm just trying to find my buds. How many more of your buds are around here junior? Look around. Let's go. They've escaped at the elevator to the upper catwalks. Find them, don't let them get away. Hi honey, I'm home. You missed me? Just go sit down. McGuinness, you're all right. What's going on here? They won't tell us. Faddem, Aziz, where are you? We are in section a. Almost done. Assist shalik in the generator room, there are some stray hostages. We are on our way. professor, you were told to sit down! see if Williams is free. Colonel gentry, I'm special agent Diana woods with the FBI. I've been assigned to advise you in behalf of the bureau. Yeah, well... Sorry you took the ride all the way out here for nothing. Uh, we're dealing with a stolen substance that is way above your security clearance. I've already been thoroughly briefed on the vx 1249 as well as the compound personnel and I've narrowed your collaborator down to 3 possibilities. Sergeant Ben mottley, corporal Nathan hower, and sergeant Max-- carver. You sound certain. He called me. How'd you pick him up? I'm a trained psychologist. I graduated in the top 10% of my class. I've got 8 years psychoanalytical field experience. Well, you might be of some use to me after all. Where are we going? Richfield power and water. Does your field experience include any hostage negotiation? No, sir... Not really. It does now. Well? This is a bureau car. That really makes me the one who should drive-- This way! shali! Go this way. I'll cut them off in the next stairway. Wait here. You killed him! What'd you expect? It's him or us. So, how did you get mixed up in this whole terrorism thing anyway... I mean, I know it's all... You know, family deal, but-- momad, come in. Come in momad. Yes? Faddem, have you taken care of the stray hostages? They are not hostages. They must be enemy agents, but they have killed shalik and Aziz. Find them. Do whatever you must, but I want them dead, do you understand? Yes, my leader. You can count on me. You want me to take care of them? No. I want you here. So do I. Yes? Very well. There are some enemy agents inside the compound already. Leave the guard shack and assist faddem in finding them. Abdul, come in. Yes, momad? Status report. The enemy is moving into position around the perimeter just as you said. Yes, I know. Keep your eyes there are some infiltrators inside the facility already. It is done. I will guard our objective with my life. Very well, go with god. all your calls are being routed through the communications Van. Have we made contact with the penitentiary? I think we should discuss that colonel. Woods, I thought you were here to assist me? You're not seriously considering answering their demands? Do you have any idea what would happen if they release that compound into the water supply? I... I have a fair idea. Fair idea! Regardless... That... That doesn't mean we suddenly start ignoring national policy on terrorists. Don't be so naive agent woods. We ignore policies all the time. Didn't they teach you anything about fishing at the FBI? Fishing? In order to catch the big ones, you gotta have the right bait. Hop to it soldier and get me the warden asap. Hey you! You! Hey! Over here! Hey! Shit! Oh, they can't hear us. What the hell was that? Oh god, the hostages. Ceasefire! Hold your fire! Who's in charge of those guys who went over there and those agents? I want to see all of your commanding officers right here, right now! On the double! Hello? What the hell is going out there, gentry? How the hell should I know. I got a bunch of trigger happy weekend warriors out here with their heads up their asses! How's your ulcer colonel? Still act up on you when you get tense? Screw you, carver. No thanks. I didn't enjoy it that much last time. I didn't screw you. You screwed yourself. No! No! You sent me out into a hot lz and then you left me there! Do you read me? You left me! You missed your extraction rendezvous. You knew what the risks were when you joined the covert ops. Well as much as I'd like to reminisce about the old days colonel, I think it's about time you called off your men and have them surrender to us. Well... You got me there tough guy. As much as I would like to say we do, we have no personnel in or on the grounds. You still hanging your men out to dry, huh? Okay... Well, you know what our demands are and you got less than 2 hours to deliver. Yeah... Kalmed farrukha. We're working on it. So that's it! We give you farrukha, you give us the goods and the hostages. Something like that. So what are they paying you Max? What's the going rate for selling out your country? You just have the jets standing by with enough fuel for a 5-hour journey and a safe transport to the airport... I'll be talkin' to you. Bet your ass we'll be talkin'. Carver served under you in desert storm? Missed that during the thorough review of the files did you? This means you've got to step down from this operation immediately. Forget it! His obvious hatred of you can only inflame the entire situation. The only thing being inflamed is my ulcer. Alright, which one of you military geniuses ordered your men to fire? hey! Hey! What are you doing in here? Hey man, is there any way out of here? Where you just came in is the way out of here. Now get moving or I'll call security. No, no. No... There's guys out there with guns. Well, good then security's already here. Now, just get away. No, sir... Would you mind us explaining to you-- no! No! Let me explain something to you! Back off! Just get away from the door. Oh, okay! Okay! Get away from the door. I'll spray your eyes out. Can we just talk to you just a second? Stand back. Stand back. I'll kill you American. come on, come on. I am going to go see what is going on. Alone at last. Don't count on it. We just got a report of an explosion in the plant. How bad? Our ultrasound teams said it wasn't very big, but they can hear the generator beginning to surge. Shit! Call the Pentagon. Get them to fax me a copy of carver's psychiatric evaluation. If he was in g2, he should have one. Maybe we can get him to come out here and lie it down on the couch for you? I'm beginning to think he just might do it. You asked him how much he was being paid. I don't think he's doing it for the money. Oh no? Then why is he doing it? You tell me. oh, my god. hey, come on. Hey, hey...You alright? I killed him. You saved my life though. I've never even touched a gun before. You didn't have a choice, Jenny. where are we going? The water plant. What? Shouldn't we find a way out of here? I overhead these guys talking, I mean, they said they're gonna poison all the water. We gotta stop them. We? Yeah, alright. Are you crazy? Jenny, I don't see anybody else coming to our rescue here. But...but the soldiers outside must have some kind of plan. We could be ruining the whole thing. I can't take that chance. What about the hostages? We just can't just leave them there. Oh, shit! Come on, let's go! Go! Well, it shouldn't be long now. What's the matter with you babe? Cat got your tongue? Why do you persist in trying to engage me in foolish conversation? Hey man, I'm just trying to break the ice. Didn't your mother ever talk to you about the birds and the bees? Is this what passes for charm in your country? No! Money passes for charm in my country and pretty soon, I'm gonna have plenty of that. Then, I'm supposed to throw myself at you? Well... I don't know. You might, once you get to know me. I don't want to know you You're a fool, you repulse me, and I don't trust you. You don't trust me? You don't trust me? You know if it weren't for me, this whole operation would have gone down the toilet a long time ago. For one, you're an American and I hate Americans. Two, you are a traitor to your own country and I hate traitors even more. So it's not that you don't trust me... You just hate me. You see we're already relating like an old married couple. I love this. Why do you make a joke about everything? Why do you take everything so seriously? Because this is my moment of truth. I've waited my entire life for an operation such as this. And I thank my brothers for the opportunity to die as a martyr for our country, for our leader and our cause. Honey, you're not gonna die. When we get to your country, we're gonna be heroes. You really are a fool, aren't you? Where are you? I'm in the tunnel trailing the enemy agents. They killed faddem. Find them! Very well. come on! Where are you going? Water tank. But he went that way! I know. Hold on. Oh, hold this. it's about freaking time. colonel gentry. What a pleasant surprise. three's a box with some guys guarding it. I'm calling the cops. Good idea. It's ringing. Speak! Yes? Hello? Who is this? This is agent carver with the FBI who is this? It's the FBI. Oh, yeah, yeah... I'm on the water power plant and um... I'm with a friend, we're on a school trip-- yes, we know all about that. Tell me exactly, where are you? We're... We're near the water tanks. Tell him about the guy. Yeah, there's some guy and he's guarding some kind of a box and he's near the water treatment pool and he's got a gun. It's nerve gas. Alright listen very carefully to me now, don't move, stay exactly where you are. You're in grave danger. We'll to try to get you out as soon as we can. What should we do? Don't do anything. How did you get this phone number? I got it from one of the terrorists. I dialed 911, it must be on speed dial or something. Well, it's probably the one they're using to negotiate. Alright, hold on to it and keep it on at all times in case we need to reach you. You understand? Yeah, yeah... Um... No... yeah, I understand. Okay, we'll be in touch. Please hurry. Don't worry. We will. Everything's gonna be okay. They're on their way. It's some of those college kids. Somehow they got a hold of Mohammed's phone and they're hold up in an exit tunnel near the water treatment plant. I'll take care of them. Wait... Please... Don't hurt them. They're just kids. They've killed two of our men. No. That's got to be a mistake. Don't go after them, please. Very touching. I'll tell them of your concern before I kill them. Jenny! Run! Hey! Hey, hey... Sweetheart. You don't have a real grasp on this whole hostage concept do you? Alive, they're valuable bargaining chips, they are no good to us dead. Could you practice a little restraint with your trigger finger, okay? Understood. Okay. FBI, I don't know, but something sounds really weird to me. What the hell did you want them to say? Kill the terrorist and dismantle the bomb? We're the only ones who can. Abdul come in. This is Abdul, go ahead. Yeah, be advised. There are 2 undesirable by the catwalk exit near you. Yes, I can see them. Shit! They know where we were. Stay at your post. We'll deal with them. I understand. That sounds like the FBI agent I was just talking to. Oh, well then, that answers my question. I think they just saw me in the back. It's alright. Elia is on her way. Just be aware of them. Shit! Oh my god, we're sitting ducks. I understand. Abdul out. Relax, we'll just have to think, think... Think... Come on. Just college kids, huh? come in momad. Yes, elia. What is it? I found Mohammed. He's dead. Very well. Meet me at the water treatment tank. Understood. It worked, we're behind them. Ssh... Someone's coming. Abdul, where did they go? They were there a moment ago. Go, go. What's that? There they go! Elia come with me! go that way. I'll go this way. Bastards! Drop the gun slowly... Really slowly. Attagirl, take it easy... Yeah.. Drop it, get up and turn around... Slowly. What? Elia! Go, go! Who is it? It's me. Farrukha's here. Be right there. Come. Let me go after them. We'll deal with them later. Just remember farrukha, any funny stuff, you're the first to go. I promise you that. You forget colonel that I am and have always been quite ready to die for my cause. You screw this up, you're gonna get your big chance. It's show time! Alright, let's go! He's here? Let me come with you. No, we need you to watch the hostages. Don't worry, you'll see your husband soon enough. Husband? Yes, kalmed farrukha is my husband. Well... of course you realize that our engagement is off. Let's rock! You to let me handle this colonel. Negative. Carver's psychiatric evaluation is a textbook case of sociopathic paranoia and megalomaniacal delusions. You picked that all up in 1 file even though the army shrink's missed it? I don't think they missed it. I think that's why they put him on covert ops in the first place. Sociopaths make perfect operatives. They can blend in anywhere and can kill without hesitation because they don't feel pity, compassion or remorse. But the only emotion they do feel is hatred and when that comes to a boil, not even they can control it. Carver is a ticking time bomb and you are the fuse. Well unfortunately agent woods, we haven't got time to discuss your little theory with the experts. I am the expert. And I know carver. okay, gentry send him over. Not so fast sergeant. This is supposed to be a trade. Well, we'll hand over the gas when he's over here with us. Negative soldier. It's not the way it's gonna be. Take it or leave it colonel. Don't push him. Let me ask you something carver. What's in this for you? Do you really wanna be a martyr for someone else's cause? I have no intention of being a martyr. How about your friends? What's their intention? Don't listen to him. Well, do you know that your sister did say to me she was here to die. My sister is young and idealistic. It's part of her training. I tell you what, you don't worry about me colonel. I have my own cause. Jesus Christ carver, you still whining about that goddamn war? I thought you were a soldier, not a sniveling little schoolgirl. Careful. Do you have any idea what I had to do to survive? Eat bugs, drink my own piss, live in a hole in the ground with the enemy all around me.
