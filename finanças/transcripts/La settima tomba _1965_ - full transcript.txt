Yes Jenkins, I recommend to sell everything and return to... Shut up! Have you called me? I understood... Bad! Bring us something to eat! Immediately lords. Be careful! Whats up? - They are hurry! But it takes time, tell it! I'm mad? Tell you it! Don't you believe that... There's nothing to believe. We must be careful what we say. I'll be right. - What are you cooking? - An omelet with bacon, ok? Well, I like omelet with bacon. Have you listen Mary? Omelet with bacon! Ohh, also here? She believed that England has another type of food. - You like it? - Yes, provided it's fast! - Pretty! - What I bring to drink? What you want! I also go... - No! And why you talked about america? The other doesn't need to know why we are here! Alright! I've fed and watered the horses. Here sir.. - Come on! - What are you looking for? - Nothing. Have you listened? Nothing! So ... eat! - I prepared you a drink! - Thanks we accept! Thanks. Here's the tea. - What are they looking for? - Quick. - And who is Quick? - A leprous. He has escaped from "Lazzaretto", the hospital where was locked... ...but from 1 month they can't take him! And, what is doing here? - He knows well these places... - Before he became ill he was an Sir Reginald's assistant. - Sir Reginald? Yes, the owner of the Nofis's castle! He died 3 years ago. - How far is the castle? - Only some miles... - Why? Want you go there? - Yes, and can we sleep? Yes, there are many beds. But ... is an eerie place... I'm sorry to have said to the notary that I was gone there to help Patrick... ...but now I have promised... Then the notary is so... So, the notary is just at the castle? Yes, you just know him? I don't know him personally but I was invited. - For the Reginald's testament. There are also other people at the castel... - Have you listened Jenkins? There are other heirs. - I hope no. Theese people will go to the castel... why you don't... Could you give a lift to my daughter? She's also going to the castle! If you are ok. - My brother is okay! - If you really want ... ok! - They are going to the castle! I confess that with the study I found myself in various difficulties... ...but today I can say that I know all the practices of the office, as my predecessor... ...and I will be able to get along well. - And about Sir Reginald's testament? I can't tell you anything. I don't know the contents. - Can you talk about Sir Reginald? - I never meet him. Sir Reginald was a doctor. He dedicates all the time with his assistants for some strange experiments... What kind? I don't know, the only one that know something is the Doctor Quick, but is afflicted by leprosy. When the nurses and the police came to the castle to take the Doct. Quick... ...they found Sir Reginal died, afflicted by leprosy. Died by leprosy ... in short time? It is weird, but the doctor's report was clear! Was a serious version of that sickness! He was very disfigured that they cannot be able to do an autopsy. Why his parents were not warned? The funeral took place in private as requested by the deceased. At the funeral was present my predecessor, a police and Patrick... ...the guardian of the castle. Sir Reginald r.i.p. in the crypt. In the SEVENTH GRAVE! What's up? There are other heirs. Who are? Miss Ferguson and Jenkins brothers. Good evening miss Ferguson. She's not miss Ferguson! She is Mary! - You are Mr Jenkins, right? - Yes, why? My name is Elliot. I have invited you. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. My brother ... Fred ... Hey he's the notary! Ohh ... yes ... how are you? - I wonder what he see in that girl! Come here! So, want you read this testament? I'm sorry, but isn't possible. Today is 16th, and the testament must be read the 18th day with all the heirs. And here is missing Lady Ferguson. Naturally she is informed... Yes, I have sent to everybody 2 letters. She will arrive soon. - And if she not arrive? She would lose her right to inherit. Please colonel, is better if you explain the situation in all the details! From old family documents result that my cousin Reginald... ...was an heir of Sir Francis Drenk... ...who was running around the seas... ...preying the ships who didn't belong to British Queen... Don't make an history lesson now! Wait... ...it seems that in this castle there is an hidden treasure. Now everything changes. What are you seeing? What's happened? Excuse me, but that table make me strange emotions. Notary, don't mind. My daughter is a sensitive medium. Really? ..because about spiritism we must be very very careful! But we were talking about treasures ... ... are you sure are here? Yes, and we should find it, also at risk of destroy the castle piece by piece. I think there is another way. She is a medium. She have a spirit guide... ... and we can use he to take contact with the spirit of Francis Drenk. Are you agree? Yes. But tomorrow, now I'm tired. So, are you agree? And you, parson, will witness at the seance? The church will allow it? The church allow me all, except black magic and relationships with malignant. I will assist at the seance. See you tomorrow! - My bag? - Here. You have been very kind. Thank you. You are welcome. Well... let's go. She's not arrived yet, I'm sorry but we must start without her presence. But, what's the utility? Mr notary, I'm ready. What he wants? He is Patrick, the guardian. The only person who knows the castel in depth. - Where do we start? - Where you want. Very well, gentlemen, follow me. - Excuse me. - No... .. I want to excuse. Really beautiful those bas-reliefs. This is the stage. - So... do you like this? - Yes ... it's beautiful ... ... it's full of poetry. Don't think? Yes. - Perhaps for the first time I realize that... - They are waiting us, come on! And this is the cemetary. Thorne's family were buried here until recently, later they used the crypt. - We are going there! - I'm interested to see the crypt. This is the room of prisoners, no interesting to see. - It's closed? - No... it's opened. - Could you warn us! - I didn't know you are so impressionable. Now we go to the crypt ... Thorne's tombs! - There rests Sir Reginald. - But it's green! - How can be possible? I've put it this morning. This is the laboratory. It's hot! Impossible! - How do you explain this? - I don't know ... maybe ... probably a ray of sunshine. Right... ... maybe... Want to continue? And now we are returned in the hall. Now we go to lunch. Betty will have just prepared. - Are you still excited? - No, now I'm very well. - So well to start the spiritualist seance? - No Jenkins! - Why no? - Really, would you be willing? I'm ready. What do we do? If you don't mind, I will command. I have some practice in these things. Ok. Quite right, colonel. First of all, we have to move that table. What are you doing? Help us! The chairs in a circle. - What are you doing? Spiritualism... look. Ohh... well. And now sit down. Let's form a chain. Do the same like the others. The chain is done. Never looked this thing. Will come the spirits? Please, the medium needs the utmost silence to concentrate. Are you ready Katryn? - Attention! Not think about anything! - Relax your body! Keep your hands theses. Call your spirit guide. I can't... absolutely ... I can't! I can't concentrate. I feel there's someone... ... that don't want ... ... don't want ... I can't concentrate. I can't. You must do it! We're waiting! Concentrate. Breathe deeply and relaxes your body. I can not... maybe ... there is too much light. A moment... - I'm afraid! - Why? Now is dark! You have to concentrate! Not think about anything! Where are you? Can you hear my call? - I want Dan! - I want Dan! - Come here Dan! - Where are you Dan? - Where are you? - Where are you? - Dan... Dan, I beg you... - insist! - insist! - Here is a presence. - We ask for his presence. - We would be enough only a shot on the table. - Dan... I beg you... Listen me! - We ask again for his presence. - We are waiting! If you are Dan, beat two times to confirm... ... otherwise one shot. We just know that you are Dan. Can you keep us in contact with the deceased Sir Reginald Thorne... ...that rests in the seventh grave of the crypt. Can you do it? One shot is Yes, two shots is NO. So is NO. Can you talk through our medium? Can you do it? Nothing can prevent it. Then we ask you to incarnate in the medium's body! - GO OUT! - GO OUT! Seems dead. Your mirror ...quickly! Is tarnished. Please, help me. We need a doctor. We can only hope in divine providence. - Parson, come here...! - What's up? Look! The chapel is illuminated. What's happened? - The chapel is illuminated. - At this hour? Isn't possible... we must check out! Weird! What's happened? How are you? Your father was scared. Sorry... ...what stupid to faint so... - Let's go! Where are you going? - At the chapel. - It's illuminated. We come with you. - I want to come but I cannot leave the lady alone. I'm very fine. I'll come. - Can I hold your arm? - That's a pleasure for me. Leave away the women. The tomb is opened! The dead man is gone. Is risen from the grave. Don't be silly! My god! Let's see if is silly! - Good evening! - Good evening! This is a letter by parson Smith, he says that Miss Ferguson will not arrive. But then Miss Ferguson loses her right to inheritance. She is died 2 months ago. Here we have found an opened tomb and a man hanged... Advise the police immediately! - Good night! - Good night! I've got a letter by parson Smith... ... that announce Miss Ferguson is died. So, she don't come here. Finally a good news! My daughter... I understand that you are impressed but think... How can you go away at night? I can't resist anymore. Are you sure that Miss Ferguson will not arrive? - Yes, the notary as told me that she is died 2 months ago. Do you understand Jenkins? One less! - Yes, but this is not what worries me. - And whats? - The disappearance of Sir Reginald's corpse. How are you, my darling? And you are asking it now? I'm sorry, you know... the events... Gentlemen, I received the news that Miss Ferguson will never arrive... ...and since strange things are happening here... ...and has passed midnight... I'll start to reading the testament. Is disappeared! How it's possible? I always kept the key with me! Has disappeared... vanished.. like a ghost! And you expect me to stay here? And that table who make shots. Shots are beyond. Let's go! Good evening. Who are you? Martin Right, police inspector. Just in time, here are happening weird things! We've found the guardian hanged with the bell rope. Someone has tampered a tomb and has disappeared the corpse. And disappear the testaments. Weird deal! But I think... ...that we will resolve. We are gathered here for the Reginald's testament. Come! Tell me all about! You are the last person who has seen Patrick alive. But I swear that I not... Yes, I know. You haven't kill him. It takes a lot of strength to lift a man. And you have not. Rather, what were you doing when you saw him? Nothing. Are you sure? Yes, I'm really sure, also if you ask me hundred times... ...my answer is always the same. What was I doing? Nothing. I served the fruits and I brought the dishes in the kitchen. As I crossed the corridor, I met Patrick going to to the door of the hall. When it happened? What time? I know not the hour. I swear, believe me! But few minutes later I came back here... ..and people were gearing up... with that! With that? Yes, you don't know ... We have done a spiritualist seance. Everybody have participated, including Betty. Yes? We have started at 17:03. I take note of the start and end of sessions. I understand. It's true. No one moved until we heard the bell... The bell? Yes. Miss is fainted and we had to stop. While the others was helping her I've looked out the window. And I saw a light. A light in the chapel. So, everybody saw it. I understand. But the bell... In that moment we listened the bell... ...and we decided to go there. Everybody? Everybody! Including Betty? Reply! Yes. In the meantime she was better. Until the beginning of the session, until it's bells ... You have always been... together. Until we saw Patrick's corpse in the chapel. Is far away the chapel? - No... If you want, I can accompany you. Is at bottom the courtyard. No, I prefer you stay here. - Mr. parson, can you accompany me? - Yes. - Thanks. Can I have a cup of tea? I don't go in the kitchen. I can accompany you. You? I swear, I do so willingly. Are you scared? Perchance. Yes, I'm scared. Young man, we will accompany Betty in the kitchen. Also we go in the kitchen. They left us alone. Why? My company would you mind? I didn't say that. But... you think it. No. -Really? - Yes. - Are you scared? - Yes. - About me? - No. - So, what are you scared of? All. This oppressive atmosphere. This castle. The tombs in the park. And I'm obsessed by the mystery of the empty grave. As if waiting for another body. I cannot stand anymore. Excuse me. I don't believe that ... - No. I'm sorry... Sometimes I can't control my nerves. But how to do it? I can't. No need to apologize. I understand you very well. Really? Yes. I understand you from the first time I known you. Are you making fun of me? Why to do it? I don't know. Maybe because I was always alone. This is my first time that a man talk me so. And will not be the last time, Katryn! Let me call you Katryn? My name is Elliot. Bill for the friends. Will you call me Bill? Bill... - And the others? Are in the kitchen for a cup of tea. - Where is Martin? He came with me in the chapel. - And in this moment ... where is? Now he is carrying out his investigations. We resume the conversation at another time. When you want. Sir parson, - You think Martin is efficient? I believe. - And you? What you are thinking about? Are you worried? Because I don't see Frank. Wasn't with you? Yes, but in a moment... - Are you Jenkins? - Yes, why? Did you notice what he had in the crown? It seems to me that... he had nothing. So, will be better if you come with me. It's necessary that you know ... ... that Patrick's corpse... ... have a buttonhole. - Are you kidding? Come, and you will see. Go! Notary Elliot, How you will set about this testament disappeared? To set? I can only make a report about the events of this night to the courts. And if you have other suggestions? I don't see how else we can be. I think this is the first time that a testament was subtracted from the hands of a notary. - Don't look if you are scared. The tomb is affixed. The grave is closed. - My dear Frank! - Is my brother! My brother, do you understand? They killed him! And you must find out who was otherwise you will pay for the guilty. We will find him! Now calm. Gentlemen, the company is good but I am no longer a young man. And at a certain time I need some rest. Good night parson. - Good night! I'm too, parson. - And you? - No, I'm staying here. - Good night! How many time takes to prepare a tea? Right! Is a long time since they left. Let's see! No, please, stay here. I'm afraid. What's up? Frank ... is in the grave of S. Reginald. if I find someone has done it... We will find him! If there is nothing else to do I would go to sleep willingly. You must rest, Jenkins. Give it to me. What opinion have you done, inspector? Is too early. If you allow me I would plan to do a tour of the castle... ...before going to sleep... Indeed, where can I sleep? I don't know. Sorry, I didn't think to you. If you want, I give up my room. Do not bother! I'm here to investigate, I see there a sofa, I can take a nap. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. I'm arrived. Good night. Good night. No... please, they might see. No, please. She breathe. Is alive. What happened? We must help her. Will be better bring her in his room. Can you help me, colonel? Up, what are you doing? I'm tired. - Change the position. Who could have brought the corpse here? I don't know. But from this moment no one will touch more it. What happened? Mary fainted seeing the Reginald's corpse. Where? In the hall. Please, take care of her. I have a thing to do... Give me the bag. Here it is! I think is better to take him away from here. If not mistaken, I've seen a stretcher in the courtyard. Can I ask you to take it? Yes ... if the notary can help me... Willingly. Thank you. Thank you so much. What happened to me? I go to the hall. My slippers? What happened? I found he so. And then there is a news. This! Thank you. What has happened to you? I don't know. I was here, when suddenly I had a strange feeling... - What kind of feeling? How to explain? No, has not been a dizzying. No. It is much more. As if someone had influenced me. Would you like us to believe... ...whether it's something... ... supernatural? No. Suddenly I heard a huge fatigue. I am too tired. We are too. - Why you don't go to sleep? Women aren't made for these things. So what? Mr Jenkins's right. Come on, I accompany. Is empty? Was so when I entered. I hope the emotions are finished. I hope! Would you sleep with us tonight? Yes. Good night. Good night. A corpse have not wings! Someone must have taken it. We must find him. I will find too. Can you accompany me, colonel? Yes, sure. I will go with you. Now the stretcher is no longer needed. It's better to take it in the yard. Help me. Here's the candlestick. Good night. Thanks, and you? There are others in the salon, don't worry. Ok, good night. Have you listened? What happened? I don't know .. I've heard a scream... Are you wounded? I hope no. And Katryn? Is in the hall with the others girls. Where is Katryn? Is in her room. Are you sure? No. Go to see. There isn't. Yet we must find her at all costs! Where will be? - So what? - Nothing! We must find her. We must divide us to search. Miss, you will go with the colonel and Mr. Jenkins. The others with me. So, let's go. - I don't want to see! Please, help me. I feel she is not far away. Ok... we will do all the possibile. - What are you looking for? A leprosy escaped from Lazzaretto. - And you are looking here? This is his house. Ok, enters. You? Yes. You don't expect it? Don't waste time... deliver me. Please, deliver me. Just a moment... Calm! - First I need to talk. What's? - About me! I don't understand. - Who do you think I am? Are you Martin?! No. My name is Reginald Thorne. Isn't possible! I saw the tomb. Empty! And the corpse in the hall? You thought it was my? I was sure. Were wrong! But how can? That was the corpse of Quick, my assistant. Was necessary... ... for Patrick... ...but you don't understand that I had to kill him. Why? - I had to have a safe haven. - It was essential. For testament I had legate all to him... ...convinced that he was an honest person. - And instead? That coward, taking advantage of the situation ... ...has threatened to sue the police on my life. I had to suppress. - How can you talk about? - And now what do you want to do? I know. - What do you have? Why you look at me like that? I look you! I think at the time... ...when I was at Lazzaretto. Among the lepers... for 3 years! - And now finally... No, please! - What would you do? - I need your blood for my experiments! You are a monster!?! - Not for now... - The leprosy has not affected my face. - I am one of the lucky ones! No! No!!! - Yes! Don't worry... You don't feel... ... any pain! - Leprosy... - ... can heal! Stay away! - I assure you! - You will be like me! Soon! No! - Soon! This experiment turns me on! The time is gone. Like me! Like me! - I kill you all!!! Sir Reginald had tried to kill my assistant but he managed to save. Mr. notary... ...sorry if I interrupt you. I want to know who notified the police? My assistant, in fact. He found the two policemen searching the leper and he tell them... ...what had happened here. Mr. notary, another curiosity... How did you know that Martin was Sir Reginald? Well, I had some suspicion... ... later, the police officer... ... told me... ...that 3 years ago they locked Quick in an hospital, because he was affected by leprosy. Doctor Quick was an assistant of S. Reginald. They did some strange experiments. As I had mentioned earlier. Some months ago came to Lazzaretto an old classmate. After seeing the medical records of his fellow student, and having regretted the incident, he visited his friend. And he was very surprised that Quick... besides not being recognized... he had become even higher. Do you understand? A leper who becomes higher. Evidently, it was another person. The doctor said to the director, and the director called the police. But, overnight the patient escapes... ...and despite the research, he always managed to disappear. He did cover his tracks. As a wild bird. Yes, but this doesn't mean that he was S. Reginald. Only a person had an interest in hiding the testament. This was bound to be S. Reginald... ...who had left everything to the guardian. Hiding the testament the property remained undivided. He committed a murder that seems useless. The murder of Frank. But, he did it only for his studies. How? A murder for his studies? May God forgive you! But in which consists his experiments and his studies? From his diary, we found that he was trying the regeneration of body cells. He spent his wealth in this research. Even the treasure of Sir Francis Drenk... ...that he had found. If we had heeded the warning of the spirit guide... ...telling us... ... go away... my brother... ...would still be here. With me. Jenkins... Frank will always be with us. In our memory. Mr. notary... could we remove... ...that thing? Ooh ... my slippers! So what? Mr. notary... I will take him to my house. Can serve. Is true Katryn? Are you going to get me to do other seance? No. - And that's good! Is always dangerous unleash forces... ...that you can not control! Religion... ...forbids... ...these seance to the profane... ...precisely for this. That's only a wise precaution. If you think... ...I wasn't arrived in time... Don't think about! You was arrived in time.
