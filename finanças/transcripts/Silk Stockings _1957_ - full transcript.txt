[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [piano music] [crowd applauding] Mr. Canfield, thank heavens you got here. I'm going to kill myself. There's no other way out. - I could hardly play tonight. - Why? I've received another wire from Moscow. Take a bow, Monsieur Boroff. Excuse me. [applauding continues] I've got to kill my, I've got to kill myself! Mr. Canfield, can you get me a knife a gun, a tall building? Oh, come, come, you've had wires from Moscow before. Not like this one, I told you they would not let me stay in Paris if they knew I was writing a score for your picture. They want you out there, Monsieur Boroff. They want me in Moscow too. Excuse me. [applauding continues] I'm lost! I'm lost! I'm lost! Give me that wire. I'll take care of it. - Now, don't worry. - Hah! What? No more bows? Ah, what am I talking about? Soon I won't have a head to take a bow with. Mr. Canfield, they're sending three commissars to take me back to Moscow. - Do you know what that means? - Come, come, come. Not one, not two, but three commissars. I know, come. Uh, yeah, uh, l-l know. I know. But, Mr. Canfield.. Now, look, uh, I'll go and see if there are any messages. You wait for me in the mirror room. Order two brandies. And stop worrying. [instrumental music] Come, we talk to him now. Very casual. Don't frighten him. Smile. - I haven't smiled in 30 years. - Try. [music continues] Good evening, Comrade Boroff. We are great admirers of your beautiful music. My name is Brankov. This is Comrade Bibinski. That's Comrade Ivanov. You, uh, seem nervous, Comrade Boroff. You have come after me? It is true that the commissar of art suggested that we look you up, say hello and, uh, point out a few things. He wanted us to tell you, how much Russia loves you, how much she needs you. And how nice it would be if you came back to Russia with us. - Or else. - 'Boroff, what's up?' Mr. Canfield, these gentlemen my comrades from Moscow, say that I must come back to Russia with them. [scoffs] Well, that's impossible. He's gonna write the score for the picture I'm producing. That's impossible! For a composer like Boroff to write the music for a capitalistic picture is degrading. And very profitable. He'll receive $50,000. How much taxes will Russia get on $50,000? - Fifty thousand dollars. - Uh-huh. Uh, furthermore, comrades, uh, Mr. Boroff's name will become world-famous. This is no ordinary picture. It stars that incomparable artist Peggy Dayton. Look at her. Hm. Looks very intelligent. And very talented, comrades. Pair of lovely eyes. Da, da, da, da, da! It is no matter. Boroff must return with us. It is the wish of the Soviet Government. What about the French Government? What has the French Government to do with a Russian citizen? Ah, but first you must establish that he is a Russian citizen. Of course, he's a Russian citizen a product of pure Russian culture. And a French father. Oh, do not talk nonsense. You never told me. Nor did your mother, apparently. Uh, I have in my possession an affidavit from one Pierre Bouchard, uh, a French traveling salesman who carried a line of farm machinery through Russia in the, uh, 1920s. That would be about right, wouldn't it? Uh huh? Would you show us this affidavit, please? I'll produce it when necessary, also, within 20 minutes I shall have an injunction restraining you from taking French citizen Boroff out of Paris. The Russian Government will fight this outrage! Undoubtedly, undoubtedly. Uh, but in courts, it will take time. Uh, meanwhile, Boroff will stay in Paris. We must communicate with Moscow at once. - Oh, Fifi, Suzette, Gabrielle! - 'Hi.' Hello! What a surprise. I'm so glad to see you. Oh. Oh, uh, I'd like to introduce my friend. Uh-uh, Mr., Mr. Boroff. - Messieurs. - And, uh.. - Brankov. - Bibinski. - Ivanov. - Well, the, uh.. The boys just got in from Russia. Say, uh, incidentally, uh, we haven't been too hospitable to our dear comrades, have we? Uh, say, how about us all having a little drink or something? We can go back to business later. - Oh, will you ladies join us? - Oh, yes. - Enchanted. - Well, that's just wonderful. Uh, you lads must be very thirsty, aren't you? Uh, are we thirsty, comrade? - Da? - Da. Uh, waiter! We'll get a larger table in here and, and then, uh.. [laughing] - Comrades. - Da? Comrades, you're too intelligent not to see it. Now, here we have the leading Soviet Composer Boroff lending his art to a Peggy Dayton picture which will circle the globe in CinemaScope. Just think, the iron curtain dissolved by music. [chuckles] Why, it's absolutely sensational. What a gesture of goodwill on the part of the Russians and what propaganda! - Hm. Propaganda! - Propaganda! Da! Hm, of course, you three will, will have to stay here and supervise and help. Well, you'll become national heroes. Comrade Bibinski, he, he has a very strong point! Propaganda! Da, da, da, da, da! Bibi, this may mean the Order of Lenin for you! Oh, you can't throw away this opportunity for greatness. Can we throw away this opportunity for greatness? Comrades, perhaps we should stay here for a while. We got to sacrifice our own feelings for the good of the party. I, I go and register. There's no need to, I've already made a reservation for you, the royal suite. - Royal? - Royal? You deserve the best. Oh, furthermore, while, while you're in it it will be called, uh, the workers' suite. Well, then, then we stay! Too bad. But for the sake of Russia!

You cannot do this to me! I am the commissar of art! I am the commissar of art! 'I am the commissar of art!' [music continues] (male #1) 'Stop!' I am the new commissar of art. My name is Markovitch. Any questions? - Comrade commissar-- - I will ask the questions. What are they doing? Peter Boroff tone poem "Ode to a Tractor." Peter Boroff? Do you not know that the Great Peter Boroff may not come back from Paris. And if he does not, he no longer has any talent? Yes, comrade commissar. Now, I will audition everyone individually starting with her. Take everybody else out. Come, ladies. Start dancing. Vassili, darling. l have made it. Finally, I am commissar. Now you can make me prima ballerina. Oh-oh, patience, little one. But you promised me that as soon as you would become commissar you would make me prima ballerina and throw out this horrible Kranelvoska. Patience. Kranelvoska has power. She has nothing, she is fat and ugly and she cannot dance. I know, but she is my wife. [telephone ringing] Markovitch. [indistinct speaking] Oh, yes, comrade minister. [indistinct yelling] Nice of you to.. What? But, comrade minister, how can I be in trouble already? I just sat down. The Boroff matter? Well, I wasn't the one who sent those three idiots after Boroff, so why is it my fault? Well, that is true. There is no one else. [indistinct speaking] Well, I will go to work on it immediately. I will send a special envoy who-- [indistinct speaking] You have a suggestion? Comrade Yoschenko? [indistinct speaking] Well, I had in mind-- [indistinct speaking] But if you say Yoschenko, that's who it will be. I will ask Yoschenko to come here and-- [indistinct speaking] Oh, you have already arranged it. Oh, thank you. May I say that I think Yoschenko is a splendid choice? - Who is Yoschenko? - Well, I don't know. I will look him up. I want to look somebody up. Does this office have a copy of Who's Still Who? (male #2) 'It's in the library, comrade commissar.' Good. 'Comrade Yoschenko' 'is here to see you, commissar.' Vera, you go look him up. Report to me later. Send in the comrade. [door opens] [door closes] Comrade Yoschenko reporting. - You are Yoschenko? - I am. - You are a woman. - I'm also Yoschenko. My credentials. But you are a woman. The commissar has good powers of observation. Oh, well, the comrade minister said but he didn't tell me.. I'm not so sure if for this job a woman well, physically, a woman is not equipped to. When the minister sent me here, he did not say it was for a discussion of biology. Oh! Please sit down. I will stand. You are my superior. I prefer to maintain revolutionary discipline. Just what I have always maintained. Now let us get down to business. You are familiar with Peter Ilyitch Boroff's music? - Hm. - You are a music lover? Music is essential for parades. Of course, well, a couple of months ago some idiot let Boroff get to Paris and naturally, he wants to stay there. What do you mean, naturally? Well, I mean he is weak. He is not strong like us. Paris has seduced him.. ...and it also seems to have seduced the men that went after him. They are weak fools. You are too kind to them. It seems to me that seduction can only take place when one is willing. Yes. I can see that you would think that. Have you ever been to Paris? No. I have never been outside the Soviet Union. Well, I have spent many years in Paris I got very close to the French people. In fact, they deported me three times. Now...about this assignment it is not very simple. To me it is quite simple. A Soviet artist has betrayed his trust. He must be brought back here with no adverse publicity at once. Thus, I will leave at once. Comrade Yoschenko. Maybe, I should send someone along with you? Comrade commissar, if you had looked at my credentials a little less casually you would have noticed that at the age of 16 l formally rejected all bourgeois pleasure and indulgence to become the head of an anti-aircraft gun crew. At 18, I became the captain of a women's tank corps. And for the past five years I have been assigned to the job of rectifying the mistakes made by foolish commissars. [door closes] [door opens] Darling, I have looked it up. Comrade Yoschenko is a woman. That's your opinion. [laughing] [clears throat] Well, we can go back to the Lido or we can take in the Folies Bergere tonight, eh? What a cigar. What a cigar! Maybe we should send a box to the commissar of art, huh? Oh, sure, sure! Maybe we should send him some postcards too, eh. From the Ritz Bar and the Folies Bergere all the places we could be shot for visiting. [laughing] Uh, but, Colette, you're not going to let your husband spoil our whole evening, are you? Alright. Au revoir, my darling. Colette has to spend the evening with her husband. Then Gabrielle must be free. She goes with Colette's husband. Uh, we have plenty of time for Colette and all the girls. [chuckles] These delicious legal delays may take weeks, may take months, maybe years. Not that we're not working on our mission. I am still prevailing upon Canfield to show us the affidavit concerning Boroff's father. Bibi, don't prevail too much. [knock on door] Entrez! [door opens] Telegram, monsieur. Merci beaucoup. Bibinski, for you. [band music] "Former commissar on extended leave of absence. "Envoy extraordinary arrives Friday, 7 o'clock "with full power. "Your authority canceled herewith. Markovitch." Extended leave of ab-absence? That means he's dead. Comrades, the envoy will be here in ten minutes. We must meet him in the lobby! Yeah, but now we have to get the affidavit at once from Canfield immediately. And warn him not to mention Boroff is writing music for him. Operator, operator Mr. Canfield's suite. Yeah, hurry up! [instrumental music] Comrade? Would you be Bibinski, Brankov, and Ivanov? Yes. I'm Nina Yoschenko, envoy extraordinary acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Markovitch. Comrade. What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade. If we would have known, we would have greeted you with flowers. What are we doing in a place like this? This looks more like a palace than a hotel. True, but that's Paris for you. Actually, it's very second-rate. Boroff is living here. We thought we stay close. So that we can observe all his movements. You're wasting time. Where do we go? It's on the fourth floor. Porter! - Madame? - What do you want? May I have your bags, madame? - Why? - He's a porter. - He wants to carry them. - Why? Why should you carry other people's bags? Well, it's my business, madame. That's no business. That's social injustice. - Allow me, comrade. - No, thank you. [music continues] How can such a civilization survive where women are permitted to wear things like these? - Here, comrade. - I prefer the stairs. - But it's on the fourth floor. - I will walk. You take the elevator. Da. Da. [gasps] Comrade. Here, comrade. This is the apartment we reserved for you Comrade Yoschenko, I hope you like it. Which part of the room is mine? You see, it's different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. - We'd to take the whole suite. - The whole suite. On account of the prestige of the Soviet Union. Oh-eh-uh, we, ourselves, we would be much happier with a little room next to servants' quarters. Which we are now going to move into. [keys clacking] Comrades, your report was received with great disfavor in Moscow. [keys clacking] You have handled this situation very strangely. [keys clacking] Comrade Bibinski? Yes, comrade? Do you spell Bibinski with two B's or three? With two B's, if you please. [keys clacking] [knock on door] Well, here I am, boys. Where's the big bad-- Uh, this is, uh, Comrade Nina Yoschenko envoy extraordinary of the Soviet Union. Well, extraordinary is hardly the word. And this is the Mr. Canfield we mentioned in our report and that's the document. May I see the affidavit, please? By all means. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hmm! I would like to meet this man this Pierre Bouchard who claims to be Boroff's father. As you see there, he's a traveling salesman. Unfortunately, he's still traveling. And you are responsible for this paper? Mm-hm. What is your connection with Boroff? - Well, he's going to write-- - Ahem, ahem, ahem. I mean, uh, I, l was just helping him because he wants to stay in Paris. Anyone who wants to stay in Paris deserves help. If you want to stay. I'll help you. I want to talk to this man alone. Leave us. Yes, comrade. Comrade, do you think you might need help? No, I will not need help. Don't go too far. I might. Mr. Canfield, you are an American? Yes, ma'am. Tell me, in America are you one of the oppressors or one of the oppressed? Oh, one of the oppressors, definitely. Aren't you ashamed? Come now, as one oppressor to the other you know it's the best spot to be in. Let's get down to business. Yes. Tell me, is it Miss Comrade Yoschenko or Mrs. Comrade Yoschenko? Please don't make an issue of my womanhood. Oh, don't say that. I was looking forward to it. I want to warn you. Any attempt on your part to interfere with our efforts to secure Boroff's return to Russia will be met with legal action from my government. We will hold you fully liable and accountable for all damages sustained by us. You know something? You ought to play Portia. I have, in Gorky's "Merchant of Venice." Now, let me tell you a few things about this affidavit. I tell you what. I won't make an issue of your womanhood if you won't make an issue of my affidavit. Mr. Canfield. I am here to represent the Soviet Union in a most urgent matter. And I demand that you take this seriously. I'll do that. Monday morning, I will meet with attorneys at the Russian Embassy. We will obtain a writ of replevin. Alright, and I'll get a judiciary habeas of the Magna Carta. What's that? I don't know, but it scared you didn't it? Why can't you understand this is no laughing matter? Comrade, we're in Paris in the spring. Why can't we make it a laughing matter? Really, Mr. Canfield. It is quite obvious what you have done to Bibinski, Brankov, and Ivanov but if you think you will do the same thing to me you had better stop right now. I didn't do anything to the commissars. Paris did, it did it to them it did it to me, it'll do it to you. Let me show you something. Come on. Don't be afraid. Now just look.

(male #3) 'Hold it, please.' Miss Dayton, is this your first trip to Paris? Messieurs, Miss Dayton is going directly to the Studio De Paris, Mr. Canfield has arranged a press conference there. Reporters, and I tried to sneak in, oh, I-- - Just a few questions now.. - Yes. I'd love to. Uh, how about you and Rock Martin? There's absolutely no truth to the rumors we're just good friends. How about you and Mel Bancroft? There's absolutely no truth to the rumors we're just good friends. Miss Dayton, I'm Peter Boroff. Oh, yes. Mr. Canfield wired about you. You're gonna do a few tunes for the picture. By the way, where is Canfield? He will meet you at the studio. Oh, swell. If I can travel 6000 miles to do a picture for him the least he can do is meet me at the airport. Is there anything between you and Boroff? Of course not. We're just good friends. Messieurs, let's pick it up at the conference. Oh, yes. I'd love it. [indistinct chattering] Monsieur Canfield, she's here. Oh, um, uh, she's here! [indistinct chattering] Darling! Thanks for nothing. Why weren't you at the airport? Later, later. Uh, ladies and gentlemen Peggy Dayton, the star of the picture I'm about to produce here in Paris. Incidentally, this is to be Miss Dayton's first serious non swimming picture. You're not going to swim at all? No, I'm going to play my first dramatic part I've always wanted to do one. Besides, on account of my ears.. ...l'm not allowed to swim anymore in pictures. But you're America's swimming sweetheart. Oh, boys, I've had it. I've really had it. [chuckles] "The Girl from the Sleepy Lagoon" "The Cowboy and The Mermaid, "Neptune's Mother." I never got a chance to dry off. No, from now on, I am just going to swim socially. Hold it, Miss Dayton. [chuckles] The point is this, for the first time we're going to use Miss Dayton's genuine and real ability as a dramatic actress. What is this new picture you're doing? Uh, well, I can't tell you much about it yet but it's based on a book. What book? Oh, it wouldn't mean anything in the newspapers. I just recently heard about it myself but it's terrific, a real sleeper. [chuckles] Not exactly a sleeper. Let's say a, a novel long neglected but ever eternal, if you know what I mean. I don't. What's the name of it? - "War and Peace." - "War and Peace?" Oh, it's gonna make a wonderful picture once it's boiled down. Of course, that title's gonna have to go. How do you feel about Tolstoy? - Who? - Tolstoy. - Who's that? - He wrote "War and Peace." Oh, that Tolstoy. There's absolutely no truth to the rumors we're just good friends. Actually, boys, we're only using a segment of "War and Peace" one of the lighter moments and perfectly suited to Miss Dayton's personality. Who is making the adaptation, Miss Dayton? - Who is the director? - Who is in the cast? Boys, boys, I haven't had a chance to think about all that. Writing, directing, cast.

If we are to spend the day together forget I am a woman and forget you are a man. [gasps] That's right. I'm so sorry. Let's go out there like a couple of steam shovels. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [indistinct chattering] Well, what would you like to do next? I hear there's a stunning boiler room over at the cement factory. What in the world is that? Dog. French poodle. (Yoschenko) 'Incredible.' (Canfield) 'Isn't he cute? Hey! Psst!' So ridiculous and useless. Can't you ever accept something because it's amusing or appealing? Does everything have to further the interest of the state? ls best that way. [scoffs] I've never known anyone like you. I've never known anyone to resist enjoyment the way you do. Now, the way you picked at that dinner well, you know you never had food like that in Moscow. In Russia we eat for strength and nourishment. Besides, the service in this cafe is abominable. The waiters are much too slow. Yes, I know. I spoke to the manager. He says he can't do a thing with them. - Why not? - They're communists. I don't think that's funny. [scoffs] You're offended. Be careful, you're behaving like a woman and I might behave like a man. What do you mean by that? Oh, now, really, Ninotchka. I want to ask you a serious question. Are you flirting with me? Of course. No question about it. Suppress it. It might be interesting for you uh, as a sociological study. Come. Let's go where we can be alone. Here we are. Uh, monsieur, madame I will work on these tonight. You will have them in the morning. Worker, brother. Madame. Where is the little comrades room? Oh, um.. ...just at the end of the hall. Pierre, about that paper you signed for the lawyer. Oui, monsieur, where I am the father of the young Russian composer. That is right. Be careful. This lady is trying to find out about you, where you are. [gasps] I'll be very discreet, monsieur. But, uh, don't you think papa could be paid a little more money? Papa has been paid enough already. But on the other hand, if papa is not taken care of there could be serious trouble. It would be very sad. (Yoschenko) 'What is the matter, little brother?' - Are you unhappy? - Oh, no. Little brother is not at all unhappy. Little brother will get everything he wishes if little brother will just blow. Oui, monsieur. - Goodbye, little brother. - 'Madame.' Why do you do that? Because you're absurd and irresistible. Ninotchka, don't you like me at all? The arrangement of your features is not entirely repulsive to me. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Don't you think in time you might go a little further than that? I have not seen the rest of you. Ninotchka, Ninotchka-- You are repeating yourself. Won't you, uh, sit down? Why do you do that? Don't you like music? Does not interest me, I suppose you use it to induce a more romantic mood. Yes, by heaven, I do. Then should you not turn the lights down? Yes, I should. Is this what is known as the courtship? Yeah. The buildup, the pitch. Then I shall get out my little black book and make notes. l have disturbed you. In a way, yes. Because you have a schoolboy approach to life. In Russia when someone wants someone he says, "You, come here." Oh, you mad romantic Russians. If you had studied Kamachev you would know what I am talking about. Who's Kamachev? He's one of our greatest scientists. He has proved, beyond any question that physical attraction is purely electrochemical. - You don't say. - Kamachev has proven it. For 30 years, he worked. I happen to have worked on the same subject for about the same amount of time and I have very good reasons for believing otherwise. Facts are facts. ♪♪ When the electromagnetic of the he male ♪♪ ♪♪ Meets the electromagnetic of the female ♪♪ ♪♪ If right away she should say ♪♪ ♪♪ This is the male ♪♪ ♪♪ It's a chemical reaction that's all ♪♪ ♪♪ And though you fascists may answer with hisses ♪♪ ♪♪ The same applies when you're mister and misses ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey diddle diddle with middle class kisses ♪♪ ♪♪ It's a chemical reaction that's all ♪♪ ♪♪ Say in love with you I fall ♪♪ ♪♪ And in love with me you also fall ♪♪ ♪♪ Though the uninstructed faction ♪♪ ♪♪ Call it mutual attraction ♪♪ ♪♪ It's a chemical reaction that's all ♪♪♪♪ You don't believe in Kamachev? - No, ma'am. - Then what is your theory? My theory is there is no theory. But you are attracted to me, and obviously there must be scientific reasons. Oh, there are reasons but they have nothing to do with electromagnets. ♪♪ I love the looks of you ♪♪ ♪♪ The lure of you ♪♪ ♪♪ I'd love to make ♪♪ ♪♪ A tour of you ♪♪ ♪♪ The arms the eyes ♪♪ ♪♪ The mouth of you ♪♪ ♪♪ The east west north ♪♪ ♪♪ And the south of you ♪♪ ♪♪ I'd love to gain ♪♪ ♪♪ Complete control of you ♪♪ ♪♪ And handle even the heart ♪♪ ♪♪ And soul of you ♪♪ ♪♪ So love at least ♪♪ ♪♪ A small percent of me do ♪♪ ♪♪ For I love all of you ♪♪ Kamachev once observed the behavior of 40 turtles for three months and he discovered-- ♪♪ After watching your appeal from every angle ♪♪ ♪♪ There's a big romantic deal I've got to wrangle ♪♪ ♪♪ For I've fallen for a certain luscious lass ♪♪ ♪♪ And it's not a passing fancy ♪♪ ♪♪ Or a fancy pass ♪♪ ♪♪ I love the looks of you ♪♪ ♪♪ The lure of you ♪♪ ♪♪ I'd love to make ♪♪ ♪♪ Quite sure of you ♪♪♪♪ You just don't react chemically or otherwise, do you? Don't you ever let yourself go? Go where? I don't know. Just go, go, go. [instrumental music] Don't you ever feel so happy that you just want to dance all around the room? Happiness is the reward of industry and labor. Dancing is a waste of time. Well, I like wasting time. Ha! Well? You go, go, go but you don't get anywhere. You're telling me. [instrumental music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [chuckling] So, uh...dancing is a waste of time? You seem to know quite a bit about it. Once, a few years ago. Yes? Look, I know perfectly well the pleasures of music and dancing but pleasure in itself is an indulgence. Only by denying selfish interests can one properly serve the state. You, come here. That was restful. Again. Your tie what is it made of? Why? Silk. Silk should be used for parachutes. [knock on door] Well! I certainly hope I'm intruding. Naturally, but come in, come in. This is Peggy Dayton, America's beloved swimming star. Comrade Nina Yoschenko of the Soviet Union. We were just having a business meeting. Sure you were. On the floor? Why should it bother you if we are on the floor? WeII.. Is there something between you? Of course not. We're just good friends. Doesn't anybody ever ask anything else around here? And listen, you we may not even be good friends before this picture's finished. About that Boroff, that creep's been following me around all day. Creep? He played me some of his music. Honey, you have got to be kidding. - I think his music is lousy. - Peggy, Peggy-- Miss Dayton, even Americans admit that Boroff is the greatest living composer. When you insult him, you insult Russian culture. If you will excuse me. - Ninotchka.. - Wait a minute. I'm not through with you. Ninotchka, please. Look, I.. Well, that was mighty tactful of you. What do you want? I read the script. I don't dig it. Did you read all of it? Did you read all of it? Oh, you know I never read any part except my own! Steve, it's just not right for me. I mean, it's cute and all that but well, I, I have to think about my following. Your what? - My fans. - Oh, yes. If I show up in a picture where I not only don't swim but I don't even do one musical number baby, they're going to clobber me. I don't want to turn it into a musical. It's too expensive. Steve, it will be worth every penny. Now, look, we'll just use that stuff in the French court and I'll play Josephine. - It's a natural! - Hold everything. And I got a great title.. "Not Tonight." I'll give it some thought. I wonder if we could use Boroff's music. No! He's too square. Oh, don't be silly, think of the prestige in having Peter Boroff write the music for one of your pictures. - You know what prestige means? - Sure. Pictures that don't make money. This will make money. Oh, Steve, he's so long hair. Peggy, look, Tchaikovsky wrote an overture for, uh uh, "Romeo and Juliet" and you know what it turned into "Our Love is Like a Melody." Say, that was a great song. You think we could get him? - He's not available. - Oh. Another Russian composer, Borodin, get this. ♪♪ Da-re da-ra-ra-re da ♪♪♪♪ Oh, sure, sure, sure but those boys had great tunes to work on. Oh, Peggy, with your quick musical ear I'm sure if you'll listen to Boroff's "Ode to a Tractor" you'll discover a wonderful theme in it even better than Tchaikovsky. Huh, with the right words and you singing it we can't miss. Of course, there is just this one catch to it. Boroff may not want his music made into a popular song. Why not? Because he's a serious musician and doesn't know any better. So you may have to persuade him. How can I persuade him if you can't? Because we're built differently. [laughing] But, comrade, you said today's communication from Markovitch orders us to meet with the French officials immediately. Yes, how can we pressurize them into revoking Boroff's visa? How? - Yes. How? - How? [instrumental "All of You"] (Brankov) 'Comrade?' Hm? Oh. Oh, yes, I think Moscow will extend our stay if we request it. Perhaps you didn't understand the question, comrade. Every day, the management puts fresh flowers in the room. What a lovely gesture. Yes, it is, a-and now, if we prevail upon the French officials as representatives-- - Why don't you get a haircut? - Huh? You always look so wintry, comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed? Isn't it amazing? At home there is still snow and ice and here, look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt when our swallows deserted us in winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal.. ...but they have the climate And, now, about meeting with the officials-- I won't need you anymore, comrades. I will find Boroff and talk to him myself. Would you like to go out? - Yes, comrade! - Have you any money? No, comrade. Here are a 1000 Francs. Thank you, comrade. Thank you very much. Thank you, comrade. Thank you. Bring back 500. Naturally, comrade. Leopard print jersey. Oh, mad! I love them! Oh, they'd be wonderful for barbecues. - I'll take six. - Merci, mademoiselle. I was to meet Ms. Dayton. Ooh-hoo! Oh, Mr. Boroff, baby I'm so glad you could make it! You come right in and sit right down here because I don't want to buy one thing that you don't like. Trousers to match. I don't know very much about ladies. Nonsense! An artist is an artist. And speaking of artists, wait until you hear me sing some of your tunes. Sing? Archie Birch, the lyric writer is here in Paris. I showed him your stuff and, baby, you will not believe what he dug up out of your "Ode to a Tractor." Commercial, but with class. [gasps] I flipped over the one he calls "Josephine, listen." ♪♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪♪ ♪♪ Dee dee dee-dee dee-dee ♪♪♪♪ But my music is not for singing. Oh, but, Mr. Boroff, baby didn't you ever hear about, uh, Tchaikovsky and, um, uh, Borodin? Tchaikovsky and Borodin are different. As composers, they have what is in Russia today a great advantage. - Oh? What's that? - They are dead. Oh, well, Mr. Boroff, baby, you see music in America has to be sort of-- But my music is part of Russian culture. I can't do it, Ms. Dayton. Please ask me anything else. [chuckles] Well, Mr. Boroff, baby, you see that's all I want, I've got everything else and, and if-if you could do this little old thing for me we could see a lot more of each other. You know, dinners and, and things like that, hm? The fitting room is ready for you, mademoiselle. Oh, wonderful! Come and watch me being fitted. - I think I better wait here. - Oh, alright. Well, I'll tell you what you just sit right down over here and I'll be right back. [instrumental music] Comrade Boroff. Nina! How did you know I was here? I had the commissars track you down. We must clear up this nonsense about your citizenship and you must return to Russia immediately. Nina, I want to tell you something. lam not sure that I wish to return to Russia. Someone might be listening. I've learned things in Paris. Here you can be what you wish. You can utter dissenting ideas in a very loud voice. The views here are different. Very different. [music continues] Tell me, comrade.. ...when a woman wears things like that is it really so attractive to a man? In a word, da! Nina, please, I would like to attend to some unfinished business here. May I call you at your hotel at 4 o'clock? We can discuss my citizenship then. - 4 o'clock without fail? - Without fail. [music continues] No, no. I tell you, the light's better out here. - But, madame, the-- - Oh, this'll be fine! Out here, I can see what I have on. - How does it look? - Perfect. Uh, but perhaps we could alter the undergarments so that the line would be more smooth. Good, good. It's what's under the dress that counts.

Oh, Boroff. Something urgent has come up, Boroff. I must postpone our meeting. Yes. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] Oh, no. It can't be. - I don't look too foolish? - Foolish? Why, you're only the most beautiful girl in Paris. I'll prove it to you. We'll cover the town. Now, look here, Bibinski, it's 2 o'clock in the morning. Stop telling me the time every five minutes. We will wait here for Ninotchka. [laughing] Messieurs.. I just got your call. I, I was having a manicure. At 2 o'clock in the morning? I cannot sleep with long fingernails. [chuckling] What are we doing here anyway? Our esteemed chairman insists on telling comrade Yoschenko all about Boroff's music being in Canfield's picture. But why? She'll stop it. It is her right as our superior. But why don't you wait till the picture is finished, huh? Look, Bibi, if all goes well you could be a hero. But suppose all doesn't go well. I don't want to be a hero. I want to live simple and die natural. We must tell her everything before she accuses us. But how can she accuse us of something she knows nothing about? Maybe Canfield told her. Maybe she is now just waiting to see if we tell her. Maybe! Maybe! Don't be so Russian. It might interest you to know that Comrade Yoschenko got a telephone call from Moscow today. - How do you know? - From me. I wish I'd never opened my big mouth. B-but how did you find out? This afternoon in my room when l was teaching Marxism to the telephone operator but we don't know what the call was about. ♪♪ Paris ♪♪ ♪♪ Beautifulistic ♪♪ ♪♪ Loves lovers ♪♪ ♪♪ Wonderfulistic ♪♪♪♪ Ooh, Steven, look who's here. Is this what it's like in Russia? You take your girl home and you find three party members waiting? Comrade Yoschenko, we do not mean to intrude but I have a very important piece of information for you. And I have one for you, Bibinski. l have made a discovery. Champagne is more fun to drink.. ...than goat's milk. She has a truly scientific mind. Comrade Yoschenko, this is very important. I must tell you immediately! I'd like to point out that I feel the same way. I insist that you hear about this. I wouldn't let Bibi sleep before he tells you. Comrades, must we talk business on a night like this when there are so many more beautiful things? I must tell you the truth about Boroff's music. Comrades, this is neither the time nor the place. Let them settle their business and we will get back to beautiful things. Very well. What is it? Comrade special envoy Yoschenko I feel it is my duty to tell you that Peter Boroff's composition "Ode to a tractor" is being used in Mr. Canfield's motion picture. Wonderful! I think everything should have music. - Meeting adjourned. - Comrade Yoschenko-- Bibinski, we are dismissed! Goodnight, Comrade Yoschenko. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mr. Canfield. Maybe we should stay a while just to be sociable. Oh, Steven! Steven, I am very happy. As we walked down the Champs-Elysees I was not even interested that it was three feet narrower than the Nevsky Prospekt. I just thought, how beautiful! For the first time in my life I looked at something and thought how beautiful instead of how useful. Oh, Steven, all Paris is beautiful. And you are the most beautiful commissar I've ever met. I love you dearly. And you are beautiful. [instrumental music] What would Kamachev say to this? - Who? - Kamachev. Your Russian authority on sex. I will tell you something Kamachev did not know what he was talking about. The Great Kamachev? Working all those years? Kamachev. All you have to do is look at Mrs. Kamachev and you will know he didn't know a thing about it. [laughing] I want to make a speech! - Now? - Now. Alright. Go ahead. No, I don't want to make a speech.

[instrumental music] Here you are. [music continues] Messieurs. Uh, we have come to watch the filming of Peter Boroff's music. Mr. Canfield invited us. - Your names, please. - Bibinski. - Brankov. - Ivanov. Just a moment. Comrades, this is a great day. To see Boroff's music put on a screen! If the picture is a success we'll claim it's a Russian production. - Da. - Bibi. We all will be heroes of Soviet culture. Imagine our reception when we return. - Crowds cheering! - Bands playing! - Speeches! - Applause! Comrades, comrades. Comrades! - Monsieur Marchand. - Ah-ha! There you are, boys. Where's Ninotchka? Uh, she told us she'd meet us here. Well, you go ahead in. Stage two. Second building to your right. - Hello, hello, hello. - Steven. Now, uh, before we go to the stage there's something I've got to say to you somewhere where we can be alone. [instrumental music] You look so beautiful today. Champagne agrees with you. Suddenly everything agrees with me. Well, now we'll see. Right there. So we make a nice, clean start. There's something I want to confess. You have a wife. Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. It's this business about Boroff's father. There never was a traveling salesman. I invented all that to keep Boroff here in this country. - Oh, really? - Yeah. You realize this means I no longer have any reason for staying in Paris? You have the best reason in the world. You're going to marry me. Marry you? Well, don't look so shocked. This is the first proposition I ever had. [laughs] Proposal. Oh, Steve, they will never let me marry you. - Who are they? - My government. - Ah, forget them. - How can I?

After this "Josephine" number we'll have some lunch. - A lot to talk about. - "Josephine" number? Isn't this "War and Peace"? Well, we made a few changes. We're still using Boroff's music but the story is now about Napoleon and Josephine. What has that to do with Russia? Well, after all, who gave Napoleon his crushing defeat in 1812? - Russia. - Da! Yes, I know, but this is an American picture. You're liable to have Napoleon win. I never change the past, only the future. Now, you sit right here and l-l've got to go and check on something. I'll be back right after the number. - Grab a chair, boys, will you? - Yeah. Thank you very much. All set, sir. Quiet, please. - Quiet! - Quiet! Silence!

Al, you better call lunch. Lunch! Lunch! Mr. Canfield, I warn you. If you dare to present my music like this-- Comrade Yoschenko, I would like to explain. Never mind that now. You were at fault, but so was I. It is now my responsibility. No. I consider it my fault. Brankov and I feel the same way. Da, da, it's Bibinski's fault! Let us not argue among ourselves. The situation is far too critical. What's so critical? We have just witnessed the most insulting travesty on Russian culture that ever existed. Now, wait a minute, l-let's not have a big tragedy over a silly little musical number. All we did was to make a popular song out of Boroff's music. That music belongs to the Russian people. What right have you to distort it? I'm afraid you don't understand, you know, in America we do this sort of thing all the time. We make popular songs out of the classics and millions of people enjoy them. No one's offended. No one's insulted. No one's forced to listen, so, who cares? I care. I care very much about something that is a part of the Russian heritage. Um, will you e-excuse us just a minute? Ninotchka, I want to.. [indistinct chatter] Ninotchka, I refuse to argue with you over anything so unimportant. The argument will be taken care of by our embassy. I will issue a detailed report of the entire incident. Fine. you do that. Let them take it up. It has nothing to do with you and me. You're quite wrong, Mr. Canfield. It has everything to do with you and me. Darling, please don't call me Mr. Canfield. Mr. Canfield, please don't call me darling! I am guilty of neglecting my duty and betraying my whole way of life because of an emotional attachment. I'm surprised you don't call it an emotional deviation leading, of course, from a chemical reaction. - If you like! - No, I don't like. I've heard of a lot of reasons for men and women breaking up but this beats them all. I thought you were all through with this twisted political thinking. Why, only a few moments ago-- I know. You were kissing me. But does every woman who is kissed by you change her politics? I thought I saw a carefully trained robot turn into a woman, but obviously I was wrong. You can love the masses, but to love one man scares the daylights out of you, doesn't it? That, of course, is your opinion. It's always your opinion. It's what you want and what you think. Everything I do is wrong, and everything you do is right. You leave me nothing of my own. If that's your idea of love. Yes, it scares the daylights out of me. Comrades, there's no longer any reason for us to remain in Paris. We leave for Russia tonight. Boroff, come with me. I will meet you at the hotel. - Maybe South America. - What? Well, maybe we could, we could go to a place like South America. But you know how they work. If we don't go back to Russia all our relatives will be in trouble. Well, my relatives.. ...I wouldn't mind so much. Comrades, there's no use talking. We're in hot water. There is no hot water in Siberia. Siberia? Well, I don't know.

But I have got to get to Moscow. Now, why can't I have a visa? l have told you for weeks now, Mr. Canfield. We do not let just anybody into Russia. It is as hard to get in as it is to get out. Just get me in, and I'll worry about getting out. Mr. Canfield, do you really mean you want to go to Russia of your own free will? - That's right. - Nobody's forcing you? No. Very strange. Why? Well, if you must know because I'm in love with a Russian girl. Well, why didn't you say so before? [laughing] No visa. [band music] [door opens] [door closes] Good morning, comrade. Good morning, comrade commissar. Here is my report on the public library situation in the city of Bryansk. You mean you have finished the whole investigation? [chuckles] That's marvelous. You must have worked day and night. Don't you ever sleep? I need very little sleep. I've already started an identical survey in the city of Rostov. Well, comrade, I'm afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else. May I ask why? It concerns your friends Bibinski, Ivanov, and Brankov. You must share the blame since it is only on the strength of your report that I sent them back to Paris again. What have they done? We have sent them on a mission concerning the sale of our films. They have been there for weeks and haven't sold one film. This anonymous report was sent to me. Listen. "They are dragging the name of your country "through every cafe and nightclub in Paris. "How can you expect the Soviet cause to gain respect "when your envoys indulge in such decadent behavior? "Last Thursday, they got so drunk "they entered a dance contest" ...and won." Something called the cha cha cha. You say your report is anonymous. How can you be sure that it is correct? It has been confirmed. I want you to go to Paris and bring them back. They can dance the cha cha chain Siberia. Please... send somebody else. You are the only one I can trust who will put the state above all personal feelings. Please. Send me anyplace else, but not to Paris. Let me stay here. Please. Please don't make me go to Paris. You are wasting my time, comrade. Do your duty. Yes, comrade. [instrumental music] I must have the wrong address. I'm looking for Bibinski, Brankov, and Ivanov. - Comrade Yoschenko? - Yes. They're expecting you. Allow me. Come with me, please. In there, please. I will take care of this. Entrez! Mademoiselle. Ninotchka! Entrez, entrez! We would have met the plane, Ninotchka but we simply had to be here. Look how well she looks. Magnifique! Let me have your coat. Ninotchka, you are the only woman who can come out of Russia looking as though she'd never been there. Formidable. Ninotchka, you arrive just in time. In time for what? what is all this? Why are you dressed this way? And this place, what is it? What are you doing here? Ninotchka, darling, you don't have to hold an inquisition the minute you come to Paris. We'll answer all your questions later. Right now the show is starting. - We should be out front. - Show? What show? We'll tell you later about everything. Now, let's get out. Hurry, hurry. Come, Ninotchka. [indistinct chattering] - Mademoiselle. - Right here, Ninotchka. S'il vous plait. Will you tell me what all this is about? I don't want to see a show. I want to talk to you. - Welcome to Paris. - Look-- Shh. Shh. watch.

[jazz music] [music continue] [applauding] [cheering] Well, surprised? Tell me, does Steve dance here now? Has he given up films? Oh, no, no, no. Just for tonight. It's the opening, and he's protecting his financial interest in the cafe. He'll tell you all about it. He'll join us in a moment. Speaking of Canfield's interests you know he's madly in love? In fact, he's going to get married. - Eh, Bibi? - Married? I would say at the earliest possible moment. Eh, Ivanov? Oh, I would say even earlier. Mr. Canfield's plans are no concern of mine. My business is here with you. - Ninotchka. - Let us go where we can talk. - Nini! - Ninotchka! [indistinct chatter] [door closes] My mission is unpleasant. Comrades, you have done it again. Ninotchka, we're no longer comrades. - We're friends now. - Listen to me. You are in a desperate position. Last time I was able to save you with my report. It won't work this time. You must find another way to defeat Markovitch. Oh, good old Markovitch. Is he still alive? How does he manage? I don't understand. You are facing Siberia and you stand here and make jokes! Of course you don't understand. Ninotchka, we are in no danger. We are not going back to Siberia. We're not going back to Russia. Not going back? Let's tell her. Ninotchka, we have settled here. - We own this cafe. - It is ours. We are now rotten capitalists, and if all goes well we'll be much more rotten than we ever dreamed. [all laughing] You mean you have deserted Russia. (Brankov) Deserted Russia? Our restaurant, this here is Russia. The Russia of goodwill and hospitality, happy people.. Blinis with sour cream.. And piroshki! We're not only serving good food we are making friends for our people. I see you have made your decision. If this is what you want I'm happy for you. Well, there's nothing to keep me here. Oh, no, Ninotchka. you must stay here. You can't go without seeing Steve. He'll be right here. There's a midnight plane to Moscow. I must leave now. [instrumental music] Ninotchka. It was nice to see you, Steve. I'm sorry. I must catch a plane. Now, don't be angry with me. l-l couldn't get into Russia so I had to get you out. Maybe I was a little devious about it but...at least you're here. I am here because of a certain anonymous report on these three. Anonymous? He wrote it. And we helped him write it. [laughing] But why? It doesn't make sense. Why should you go to so much trouble to get me out of Russia? - Well-- - Certainly, it makes sense. We told you, he's in love. Yes, I heard you were going to be married. Congratulations. Darling, we're going to be married. - We? - Yes, you and I, us! I wrote and wrote to you about it. Oh, Steven I only received one letter from you and that one they wouldn't let me read. It began, "Ninotchka, my darling" and ended..."Your Steve." I'm not gonna tell you what came between but I'll prove it to you. It will take a long time, Ninotchka. At least a lifetime. [instrumental music] You.. ...come here.
