Quiet Soldier! - Hi, Alma. - Hi, Dave. - What'll it be? - Fill'er up. Okay. A priest came by looking for Eddie. He asked how to get out to your place. Anybody with him? Just a taxi driver. - How long ago? - Oh, twenty minutes or so. - I got to use your phone. - Oh, sure Alma. Help yourself. - How are you, Bett? - Hello, Earl. Quit looking at me, Earl. How you been? Fine. No, not fine. Lonely. - You should have gone out. - I tried it a couple times at first. I didn't like it very much. There've been a couple guys. Nothing special. Nothing memorable. Listen, Bett. I don't expect anything from you, Earl. I'm just glad you're out. Your wife ever answer that letter? - Nope. - Disappointed? - Nope. - How about your kid, you ever hear from him? - Nope. This place we're going to, it's not very fancy. It's a cabin. I can cook for us. How far is it? Half-way to Eddie's. I kept 18 for you. Like you said. It's off the highway. It's a lot quieter. You want a drink? I brought some of your clothes in case you want to change. Thanks. Earl. (Shit...) - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. Let's get outta here. In the morning. Let's go now. Let's go right away. Let's head east. Let's not go to Eddies. I got to. I got business. I'll drop you off in town this morning, but I'm going on. My grandfather was a... Justice of the Peace. Greenville, Kentucky in 1882. This is his watch. I didn't want to. They had me so scared I... I didn't know what I was doing. Honest to God. Eddie's dead. Bett. Bett! Who fingered me? No. C'mon, c'mon. We haven't got much time. I got glass in my face. The name of your contact. Screw you. I tell you and I'm dead. Who fingered me? Jake Menner. Tell me about him. He's a collector. A big deal. He works with bookies that are in the fancy hotels. Okay. That's Menner, now tell me who set up the contract? - Oh, I can't - You better try. - Jim Sinclair. - Where can I find him? You're making me dead. Well, you're dead anyway now or later. He runs a club in Bakersfield. Near 14th street and the highway. The Three Kings. What's the beef against me, Frank? We don't ask. Okay, Frank. Let's go call Menner and tell him what kind of job you did. Earl? Don't hurt him anymore. He tried to kill me. Why shouldn't I hurt him? Move faster. (Let's go.) Move. C'mon. Move. - Who you calling? - Glenn Blackwell. Downtown L.A. - What room? - Suite 11 A. Eleven A. - What do I say? - Macklin's dead. This is Orlandi. Let me talk to Menner. Menner? It's done. Macklin's dead. No. No trouble. Ten minutes ago. Alright. How many are there? Five or six. Sometimes seven. It keeps changing. It's a poker game. It goes on for a week. - You got any money? - Not on me. Get some and take off. You better go a long way. - Is this your car? - Yeah. (nice) No use trying it again, they'll know you missed. You got a handkerchief? Start the car, Frank. I think I got pieces of glass in my face. Start the car. Frank. Start it! Get outta here! Die someplace else. The didn't tell me what they were going to do. They just told me to take you there. They were going to cut my face. Not kill me, just cut my face up. They showed me a razor. They were at the club every night. They knew where I lived, they used to sit in front of my apartment, this guy in a car watching me. You know how they are, Earl. It's like they own the world. Earl? I'm sorry I did it. Yeah. They're gonna come after me, aren't they? Sure they are. Is it alright between us? Yeah, it's alright. What'd they do to you? They didn't do anything. C'mon let's see... (Let me see.) Who did that? - It doesn't matter. - No it matters. Who did that? Jake Menner. What his name keeps coming up. Hey, you can't park out there, pal. Be right back, pal. Up! 'round the corner. What's the setup in there? You're crazy. That's big league in there. You're a busher. They're not paying you enough not to tell me. Alright. There's seven players and two punks. - Sluggers? - Nah, they're cheap labor. If there's more than two, I'll be back to see you. Like you said. They don't pay me enough. - What's your name? - Al. Turn around, Al. Make it on the left side, will you? I got a bad right ear. - Yeah? - Al. Put your hands flat on the table. Now, bring out your wallets. You don't want to bring out anything but the wallets. Quick. You're making a mistake friend. You don't want to knock over this game. Collect the wallets and the bills on the table. Get Menner's first. How come he knows you, Jake? He didn't. But he does now. Asshole. Who are you, friend? Macklin. We heard Macklin's dead. Heard wrong. Put 'em in Menner's coat. Yours too. Don't be so goddam sloppy. Bring me the coat. Don't come in front of me. Behind the table. Face the window, hands on your head. You too. You're finished, Macklin. You're dead. Shut up. Don't tell me Macklin. We don't want no trouble here Jake! I'm telling him the Outfit's gonna break his ass. Tell me about the contract, Jake. Piss on you. Tell him Jake. You're a guest here! You hit a bank. You and your brother and a guy called "Cody", before your stretch. Midwest National in Wichita. Right. The Outfit owns it. So you know how it is. You hit us, we hit you. - Blind operation. - Blind or not, it was an Outfit deal. You hit my brother and you came looking for me. That's no good. Now, the Outfit's going to pay me money for my trouble. I figure, $250,000 to make things right. Tell your friends. - Do you know who you're talking to? Yeah, I know. Keep your hands on the table. That's the bill. Two-fifty. I hit you until you pay me. What I take in between is... extra. We got nothing to talk about. That's a nice ring. You going to heist it counsel? Nice you can afford a ring like that. You're damn right. You shouldn't use a girl's arm for an ash tray. Stay put. We don't want a beef here in the hotel. See you guys around. I thought you said you'd be right back, pal. I got held up. - Where are we going? - North. - Breakfast? - Coffee. - How about you. Breakfast? - No, just coffee. Big spenders. - Where's Cody? - Out back. Get him. Get him. I'm Cody. - I can't seem to place you boys. - We know some friends of yours. Yeah. Who would that be? They're old friends. People you used to know. Don't they got names? The names don't matter. Well, it's always nice to hear from old friends. What, you going quail huntin'? Sure. Quail. - You're too late. - Why's that? You've got to get up early in the morning if you want them. When they're feeding. If you want birds. Well, thanks for the tip. Your guns are too big. - Oh, yeah? - Twelve gauge. Tear a bird apart. - Is that right. - That's right. Leo. You want to know about guns you ask Bob Caswell, there. He's the Sheriff. He knows all about guns. Don't you Bob. That's the truth. You know something Cody? You ought to play the races. You're that lucky. Friends of yours? I know 'em. A pair of sweethearts. He who believes in me, even if he dies, shall live. And whoever lives and believe in me shall never die. We weren't married. This house doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to his kid. Of course, he hasn't bother to write for ten years. Twenty-four thousand. There'll be more later. Where'd you get it? Poker game. Damn, you got to think I'm dumb, Earl. I don't want any part of it. Eddie was retired 'til you came back. No more jobs, just... fish, work around the house. Then you came and it was one more job because it was his brother. He was afraid you'd get hurt without him. You had to hit the Outfit. But was Eddie got killed. God forgive me Earl, I wish it was you, not him. Yeah, but it wasn't me. - It'll be settled. - Money won't do me any good he's dead and in the ground, God rest him. It won't do you any good either. What do you want it for? You got a woman. You got time. That won't satisfy you. Men like you, and Eddie and the others, just can't let things be. You can't leave people alone. Leave me out of it Earl. I don't want your money. I just want to be left alone. Eddie's my brother. I owe him something. You'll be shot down like he was, like a dog in the gutter. Your time's used up. Eddie knew it - why don't you? I have to go, Alma. - No, no not yet, hun? - I have to go. Good bye. Art? We got a problem. Nope. No, you got a problem. I heard about your accident. A little later you can tell me all about it. - We're closed. - I'm looking for Cody. Never heard of him. I'm Macklin. Drop the act and tell Madge I'm here. It's alright Packard. Hello Earl. Want a beer? Ah, this is uh, Bett. Madge Coyle. - You want a beer? - No, thanks. - You're a real nice looking girl. - Thank you. Earl always could pick 'em. We weren't expecting you though. He never worked with a woman long before. Times change. I got to be careful Earl. You know that. Harry Laudermilk was through here last summer, he stayed a month and grew a mustache. It didn't help they made him in Dallas. He's doing 5 to 15. I hadn't heard that. - What about Al Ryan? - Dead. Lord help us. What a life... Absent friends. - Well what are you lookin' at? - It's your ugly face, you shit kicker. - Hello, Earl. - Cody. Take a load off Cody and have a beer. You see anybody we know? I been in the woods. Well, this is Bett. She's with me this time around. Cody. - How you been? - The same. How'd they make you? A bar, routine vice squad roust, I was heeled. Cost me, two-and-a-quarter inside. Ooh, that's hard time. That's weird. The vice squad. - Know about Eddie? - Yeah. Look, a couple of boys, they braced me at my diner. What's the ticket here? Mid West National is an Outfit front. I want to do some work for Eddie. They're not used to getting hit. They'll be soft. That sure is soft. They'll kick you ass. - What's your idea of a split? - 50/50 everything, I pay the expenses. No, the expenses, they come out of the pot before we split. Just like always. I got a personal stake. No need for you to bankroll it. - That's the way I want it. - Suit yourself. - Don't need the girl. - What? We don't need the girl. It's like I told you this time around, that she's with me. Start worrying about the girl, might forget about your work. It's up to you Cody, if you're in I'd like to have you. If you're out... I'll get somebody else. Either way she stays. Well, you always did need lookin' after. Hi. - 'How you doin' Amos?' - 'Not bad.' 'Earl Macklin, Amos Hopper.' '- Any friend of Cody's' '- Yeah. Thank you.' '- How ya doin'?' '- Let's see what you've got.' 'Two pieces?' 'That's right, but good equipment.' I've got some fine equipment for you. .38 Smith & Wesson. Snub. Rear site's been removed. New plastic grips. Rounded front site that won't hang up in your pocket. You know, like they say, "handy for pocket or purse." Is that the best you got? For the size and price, yes. Now. If you want a more powerful gun... Here's a Colt .357 Magnum. A little larger but will do a lot more damage. - What are you asking for the little .38? - Oh, I can let you have that for $200. Better take the magnum. - That'll be 50 dollars more. - Eh, make it the magnum. You're absolutely right. It's a superior piece. You know, I've sold it twice before. No complaints. I'll buy it back from you when you're through with it. Half price. If we pass through. Yeah. And the second piece? Colt 45 army issue. Powerful weapon, hard to come by... but I've got a cherry and it's a steal at 300. Like I said, it's a real cherry. - Need ammunition. - Sure. Hundred rounds for each piece. Sounds like you've got a war Macklin. I don't know. What do you think Cody? Whatever you say Amos. Irish straight please. - What'll you have friend? - Irish straight. I want to talk to Sinclair. Jake Menner sent me. Menner? - Don't know the name. - You better make sure. You don't want to get in any trouble. You got any message for Mr. Sinclair, you give it to me. I don't talk to guys wearing aprons. Get Sinclair. Alright. Down the hall. Hold it. I'll open the door. Yeah, come in. - I don't know you. - Menner sent me. - The hit you set up didn't work out. - Yeah I heard. How do you like that? That Macklin's a real pain in the ass. They tell me maybe he'll come here. - You think so? - Maybe. What's he got against me? It was Menner's contract. I'm sposed to send a slugger, I send a slugger. Know what I mean? Macklin isn't going to bother me. What for? You send a guy out to kill somebody maybe his feelings get hurt. That's no way to look at it. Nothing personal. - You're Macklin. - That's right. Maybe we should talk things over. You hold it right there. You go on back and chop them ribs. Where's your safe? No safe. - It's in the cabinet. - Give me the key. - It's open. - Shitheel operation. I guess you guys don't get robbed much. Do you? Nobody gets away with it. I'll remember that. Down on the floor. Move! Start doing push ups. Count! One... '- One...' '- Two...' Louder, I want to hear you all the way out. Three, four - count! 'Five.' Don't be brave, brother. You just work here, remember. - Did you get it? - Yeah. Damn! C'mon! Move! They made the car! - You did good work there. - Don't touch me! - Chemey around? - Who wants him? Earl Macklin, from St Louis. Jason? Go on down and see if Chemey's down there. A fella by the name of Earl Macklin wants to see him and he's got another fella with him. Judge. He won't hurt you none if you don't go near the house. - So you're Earl Macklin. - It's your brother I wanted. - You asked for Chemey. - You're Buck. What makes you think so? You're Buck. Go tell your big brother I want to buy a car. - [laughs] - Shut your face. I don't know you mister. I think you better get off my property. I'm going out to the garage. You want to keep that dog right there beside you. Judge. I'll break its neck. Judge. Stay. Better stop right there, mister. I'm Earl Macklin, this is Jack Cody. You're gonna have to do a little better than that. Three years ago you sold my brother a... green, '68 Dodge, four doors, 2000 dollars. A week later he sold it back to you for $1250. We were his partners on that job. What job was that? Mid West National, Wichita. How come Eddie isn't here himself? He's the one that did the driving. He's dead. Buck. You bring us sump'm to drink, unh? C'mon. You ought to talk to that brother of your about his manners... Hey! Don't you worry about him. It's that damn bitch he's married to. Didn't hear nothing about Eddie. What happened to him? Accident. Nice fella. The best. - You looking for something special? - Something dependable. Clean papers. Wanna take her out of the state? No, local. But I want to leave that Chrysler. - How warm is it? - It's legitimate. Maybe we can make ourselves a deal. A couple of boys in town, they got themselves a Dodge last week. Thank you. Maybe we can wait here a little bit then you and me and Buck, we'll go down and have a look. How's that? Be abliged. Girl here's a problem though. You know, she got a 1971 Plymouth engine in there? Brand new Chevy brakes. You think she'll move? That's not enough weight for the power. No sir. I've got the back and front end leaded down real good, even got a... special cooling system in there so she won't burn up. Got it all worked out. No, I ain't. Just one thing wrong. I can't make her sound like a Volkswagen. I put every kind of muffler there is in there and they just don't sound quite right. See, a Volkswagon fires up real slow. That's what it is. I'm gonna get her though. You see mister, there ain't nothing I can't do with a car. How long before you're going to need your car? Right away. Well then we ought to go have a look, huh? Alright. Wanna come on inside and have a drink? No, thank you. You sure? We got time. No, thank you, m'am. You got a problem? Lady, after a while, a fella learns things. Some women are trouble. Suit yourself. I always do. - Runs okay, eh? - Yes it does. The car's hot in Idaho, the plates are hot in Arizona. But, they're off a Cord so you got nothing to worry about. They still got Cords around? You give me three days mister I'll get you a Stanley Steamer. How much do I owe you? It's a pretty good car for you on short notice you know, and from Arizona, it don't have no salt corrosion on it. - A little sand in the carburetor. - Well... - How much? - $4800 plus your car? - You got papers? - Yeah, they're on the dash board. You can put any name you want on 'em. Buck. Buck, I want to talk to you. Not now honey, you can see I'm working. Buck, I got something to tell you. He tried to rape me. Hey you, get back in the house. Shut up! You, you never stand up for me. I am Buck's wife. He tried to put his hands all over me. - What the hell? - Easy Buck. Easy! Why the hell would she say that if it doesn't happen. She's got no reasons. Look. She offered it but I turned her down. Hey... - You a lying... - You don't want to do anything... -C'mon, fella... Get outta the way. Judge! Here you, Judge! God damn you! Alright, now, you leave me out of it cause I'm neutral. No you're not, you're his brother. She was hoping he'd get himself killed. God damn liar - I never did. Keep your mouth shut! I'll talk to him. Now, I don't want this cracker asshole following me around the country with a shot gun. Next time, I'll kill him. She offered it to me once or twice. Bastard, you took it! Wake him up, tell him what I said. Soon as you're gone, he'll do better just with me. - Damn you, Chemey! - Shut up! Sorry about all this fuss. Just settle it with your brother. - Some city. - It's a city. They're all like this. Well, I hate 'em all then. Some memories are towns. Reno, Miami. It's the same there. - Want a cigarette? - No, I'm giving that up. Seem like I can't do anything anymore without running out of breath. You ever been up to northern Oregon? When I was a kid. It's where I got my diner. Oh, you oughta see the snows up there. In the winter, the snow, it just gets over your head. - Sounds alright. - Prescott, Oregon. They got an army base nearby there. Boy, I was sellin' them soldier boys lots of ham 'n' eggs. And I can short order a good egg when I put my mind to it. Yeah, you can live up there all your life Earl. Never have to worry about it. - Maybe I'll come through there sometime. - You do. You stop by and I'll fry you an egg. Yeah, I think I'll do that. You know, before when we started... I didn't give a damn. Now I'm scared I'm going to get my ass shot off. It's taking all the fun out of it. Maybe we're getting too old for this line of work Earl. Hmm? Anyways... You got a place to go to. You're a business man now. Well, you know, a man's got to change his routine every so often. Hell, nobody's luck holds forever. - Kenilworth Finance. - Four.

That's right. Menner sends his regards. He's had to quit poker for a while. Maybe the bum will spend some time doing what he's paid for. - It must be tough running a big business. - Yeah. Yep. How do you want the 250? Small bills, used, hundreds or less. Delivery in a neutral place. - You know why I'm paying you. - I'm aggravation. Small aggravation, Macklin. - On a good day we take in 250 by noon. - That should make it easy for you. The red-head's my wife, Rita. We've been married a year. She's not very smart but, she treats me right. She treats me just fine. You know what I mean? - I know what you mean. - Sure you do. You know what I'm talking about. These dumbos. Any stiff could get lucky. Rita mighta got hurt. She'd have been okay but you wouldn't have. Well, you've got confidence. I like that. I appreciate it. I don't care what you think. Just as long as you pay. Hard guy. You think you're Dillinger. You're nothing but a god damned independent. A heist guy. You got no operation, you go around sticking up banks. What kind of operation is that? Remember, small bills, nothing bigger than a hundred. Get in touch with my people, it'll be taken care of. Macklin. Don't brace me again. Check the back. Gimme the key. It's open. Wait a minute. C'mere! It's a setup! I had a chance to deal. He pulls a god damn fire alarm and you miss him? Shut up! Guy got close to me, do you understand that?

Expect me to sit around this - this room and stare at the GD ceiling? I went out to get some cigarettes. For you. And get your feet off our bed! Alright, forget it! - I'm not gonna forget it. - I'll be seein' you. How do you expect me to forget the way we live? moving around like some goddam grape pickers or something. That's the way its got to be. All I do is, is, sit around motel rooms and wonder whether or not you've gotten killed. Someday, I'll be sitting here and you'll get killed and I won't even know. You just won't come back. God damn you Earl! You listen to me! Don't ever touch this gun again. You and your God damn gun. Don't ever touch this gun again. I'm going home anyway. So go. I called my daddy. I'm going home. I just went out to get some cigarettes. - They're looking for you too, you know. Nobody saw me Earl, I swear to God. It doesn't make any difference anyway, we're getting out of here in the morning. - Yeah, some other motel. - That's right. That's right. - Was he a good man? - The best. Can I have this when you leave? I'm not leaving. - Know what I wish, Earl? - What do you wish? I wish I didn't love you. And... I wish I didn't have anything to feel sorry about. And... I wish you'd grow some hair. Let's get out. I can't get out. They won't let me and I don't want to. I got to settle this thing one way or another once and for all. Maybe you don't understand that but that's the way its got to be. It doesn't have to be. It does, with me. Can't we just go some place and hide? That's what Eddie did. The black and white? Yep. What do you think? Stop or run? Better stop. Ready? Hi. May I see your operator's license please? Would you take it out of the wallet for me? - What's the problem? - Is this your address? Yes sir. What's the problem? Just a safety check. I'll have to inspect the vehicle. It's a hit! Stay down, Bett! Menner! Let's go! Earl. Bett? The death certificate has been taken care of. - Pneumonía. - Yeah. You want to see her? No. Pretty girl. It's going to be extra for the paper. How do you want to take care of that? Cash. - Your credit's always good here Earl. - Cash. She had a watch. Gold. I've got it in the office for you. You keep it. - It's a good watch. - I don't want it. Alright Earl, whatever you say. You take care of the funeral, see that it's done right? I'll take care of things. Don't you worry. I'll appreciate it. Where to now? Only one place left to go. How's it look? Very tight. They got lots of personnel on the grounds. Guards, Dobermans, flood lights, eletric gates, and a couple guys patrol the neighborhood every half hour - We got a chance? - Well, maybe to get in. Getting out's going to be a bitch. This is private with me, now you can... ...get out with no hard feelings. I'll stick around. See how it comes out. Why aren't the lights on? That's gin. How long are we going to stay cooped up in this mausoleum? Shut up, Rita. - I'm going to bed. - Well go to bed then just shut up about it. Have to borrow you boys' car for a while. Back up. Allá vamos. - Where's Harry and Max? - Search me. - They back yet? - Yeah, they're back. Are you going to kill me? Don't know yet. Make a sound I'll... I'll blow your head off. Can we deal? Not anymore. Damn you. Why'd you have to kill him? He owed me money. - That damn thing's late! - You sure you set the thing right? Yes! I must, rest a minute now. Just a minute. Stay out of it. He's dead. You're unemployed. Earl? - I'm not sure I can make it. - Well rest up for a while. You got a cigarette? - I thought you was quitting. - Yeah. You ain't quit all of a sudden, you got to taper off. I'll tell ya one thing. I'm quitting at this job. I'm retiring. Why don't you go ahead, I'll... catch up after a bit. I have no place to go to. Have to finish your cigarette. Boy. We went all the way this time didn't we Earl? Yeah, we sure did. What the hell. Are we just going to sit around here all night? Any time you're ready. I'm ready. Reduce to an inch and a quarter. I got this one but there's more inside. Gimme a hand! - What happened to him? - Too much smoke. Cody, I thought you said it was going to be a bitch getting out of here. Hey Earl? The good guys always win.
