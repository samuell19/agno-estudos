Someday I'm gonna have my own fleet of buses. Mm-hmm, in the meantime why don't you turn off that light and go to sleep? I'm working on a new verse. It'll be there tomorrow. Go to sleep. After a show, I could never turn my head off. I kept seeing myself up there, onstage, singing. I wanted it so badly. When you want something like that, you can't let go 'til you get where you're going. That was one of my Grandma Teeden's sayings. She always popped up when I needed her. (laughing) I got you! (screams and laughter) No fair, Grandma Teeden! You come around the side. Well, you're too fast for me. I had to be a little sneaky. Ah, look what I got, Granny! A nice, tender morsel. Should we put gravy on her and just gobble her up? No, Grandpa, then I wouldn't be here anymore. Oh, yes, baby, you'll be here. Once you're in the heart you're always there. Come on. Grandpa Luther was a cobbler, but when the shop was closed he got laid off. He stood on that unemployment line for weeks until finally it ran out. Made me sad to see it, but Grandpa and Grandma wouldn't have no sadness. They made those summers I spent with them the happiest of my life. Grandma Teeden believed whatever you do in your life you do it right. You shaved yet? I ain't even out of bed. It's 5:30 AM, woman. I'm putting up buns, getting the milk, you get yourself down here. Your shirt's all pressed. She believed a man gets up and gets dressed and looks for work, whether there is any or not. Where's my shirt? On the chair. If it was a snake it'd bit ya. You are something else, Theresa, going through this foolery every day. Well, I won't have the neighbors thinking just 'cause you was laid off you lie around in bed all day in your nightclothes. Okay. Just sit right there. Right here, where everyone can see you. Right here-- sit down. Grandpa was a good sport. That's right. Well, he made a fuss, but in the end if it made Grandma Teeden happy he'd sit on the porch all day in his suit and tie and wave at the neighbors. I called her Grandma Teeden 'cause when I was little I couldn't say her name. So she just stayed Grandma Teeden. She sat in the same seat three times a week, rain or shine, 'cause it was near the piano and she wanted me close to the music. There's someone sitting in your seat. No one else dared sit in Grandma Teeden's seat. (clearing throat) Young man, the Lord spoke to me not minutes ago, and He told me, "Theresa, this little girl needs to sit near the piano." And-- And then He told me, "You go over there and you explain to him how important it is for him to move." ♪♪ That was very nice of him. ♪♪ ♪ Shall we gather ♪ At the river ♪ Where bright angel feet ♪ Have trod ♪ With its crystal tide ♪ Forever... Grandma loved to sing. She said it was God putting a holiday in your heart. And I'm gonna sing on television and records. Well, I bet you are. And I'm gonna be at the Grand Ole Opry, like The Judds. Now how do you know all that? I just do. I believe you. Well, that means you're gonna be away a lot, and you'll be traveling here and there. And-- And there's gonna be times when you feel far away. Grandma, what if you get so far away God can't find you? Oh, no, baby, He can always find you. When you start feeling that way you just say to yourself, "Who moved, me or God?" I moved. That's right. God never moves. We're the ones. Good night. Good night. LeAnn, honey, LeAnn, baby, wake up. We're pulling into Nashville. You need to get up and get dressed-- ooh! Watch the head. Nashville: across that bridge was everything I dreamed about. Hey, look, y'all, it's The Grand Ole Opry. But we weren't playing there. We were playing the Graystone Auditorium on West Fourth. (cheers and applause) But you know what? Our bus pulled in and for the first time in my career there were people, fans, wanting my autograph, knowing my music. It was amazing. They put you in your own dressing room. It's got a shower. Tomorrow you rest 'cause the next day we got wall to wall meetings. Gotta be at the record company at 10:00, then they're taking us over to see some publishers. Can I have your autograph, please? Sure, sweetie. Here you go. Thank you. Uh, Lee, they want a picture over here. These gentlemen right here. Hi. Lee, you wanna go over the set list? You wanna do "Blue" right here or where we talked about? If we talked about it, why would we move it? That's what I told you. You guys are driving me nuts. Here's the rundown, no changes. I don't care if the President calls. I do! Leave it, Mom. It's hanging in your face. I like it, it's natural. Looks like one of Grandma's old mops. I like it. Okay, guys, it's time. Okay, everybody. LeAnn needs to get herself together.

Well, it embarrasses me, too, but there's-- gotta do what you gotta do. I don't know why. Honey, there's things that you can't help. But aren't you afraid of going to jail or getting arrested or something? What did you think that was? Dope? Well, of course. What else could it be? Oh, my Lord. Oh. (chuckling) Insulin. Oh. I'm a diabetic. I take insulin to regulate my sugar. Ain't you never heard of a diabetic before? Well, yeah, but... I've never-- just never met one. Well, there's thousands of us out there. People used to die from it 'til they discovered insulin. I only need to inject it twice a day, though, then I'm fine. Oh, I see. Well... (chuckles) I'm so sorry, I just thought that... well, next time you do it, I won't turn away. I won't need to do it until way late tonight. What happens if you don't take your shot? I go into a coma.

Well, you and all those people were locked in this bus in the blizzard, freezing. That's right. Well, in those days it took a long time to get from one place to another so people packed lunches. Picnic baskets. This here sandwich is froze solid. Pass it over here, I'll thaw it out for you. Did you have enough to eat? Yes, thank you. I had me some sandwiches from that kind little girl and her mama. He's blind. We fetched him over and took care of him. They shouldn't be traveling by themselves. He's blind, not deaf.

You wouldn't get ten feet in that blizzard. At least we're safe in here. When we don't get to where we're supposed to be they'll send people for us. Well, well, now, Miss Singing Star, what makes you think so, huh? I mean, you heard any cars pass by out there in the last, what, six hours? We'd run out of water hours before.

Well, what about the story? Come on, come on, we gotta go. Go. We're always going. We never finish anything. We don't got all night. You're singing at the Grand Ole Opry. I couldn't believe what I was doing here with this crazy woman in an alley miles from anywhere. I wanted out. Where are you going? That's our ride. Get in. Hi. LeAnn, this is Carl, my husband. Well, you're... (chuckling) Wait a minute, he was the guy-- Things ain't always what they seem, are they? Well, get in, girl. I don't know why I got in. I just did. That was the thing about her. She made you think the craziest thing was normal. Then I started seeing headlines: "Singer Kidnapped By Maniacs". Seems like we were driving forever. It started getting dark and I started getting real worried. Where are we going? Oh. We're going to where you had the bus accident? Is there anything there? All right, it's right about here. Get out, this is it. Are we going to see the bus? Where are you taking me? What do you think, honey? Ain't it a dandy? It's got a steel frame covered in weatherproof plastic. You can almost see through it. What's the word? Translucent. Yeah. And the insides is filled with 12-volt bulbs, like car headlights. You can see it for miles. Trouble is there usually ain't nobody around for miles. Did you think you was meeting your maker when that light came on? How do you know about this? I mean, how does it work way out here in this field? Carl and me made it. He was a welder by trade back when he worked. But how does it... It's got a motion detector. This here is where 18 people nearly breathed their last breath. Soon as we move on, lights go off, it's black again. Don't you know this cross has scared a few people half to death when it come on way out here. (chuckling) Why did you do it? Memory. I got one more story to tell you. I had a visitor that year when I was in Nashville: my dad. He had ridden the bus all the way from Conway, Arkansas, where I was raised. He had written me three letters saying he'd be at my house for Christmas, but I didn't answer one of 'em. Why not? Well, honey... my daddy and me hadn't spoken for nigh on 25 years. But-- Back when I left home, nice girls didn't go into show business. Least not where I come from. ♪ I need thee ♪ Oh, I need thee ♪ Every... I was always singing. I guess everybody sung back then, but I wanted to sing country... at the Grand Ole Opry. If you'd open your Bibles with me please to the book of Isaiah. As soon as I graduated high school, I bought a bus ticket out of town. (voices arguing, muffled) Listen, I can't give her my blessing. Listen to me, you step out of this house, and you have no daddy! I mean it, girl! You have no daddy. You'll never see her again. Daddy kept his word. The only time he contacted me was to tell me my mama had died. I got his letter the day after the funeral. When I had them hit records and everybody started to know me all of a sudden people I hadn't heard from in years was related to me. That's when I got them letters from Daddy telling me he was coming to see me. You know what I thought he wanted? I thought he was coming to ask me for money. That's what everybody else wanted. You'll find that out. But you didn't... That's right. I couldn't let go of my hurt, my pride. I didn't see my own daddy when he came to town... for Christmas. I was still so angry, I didn't ever want to see him again. I left him a note and went off to do my show. In two hours I knew I'd be on that bus and out of town. Then I discovered I didn't have my insulin. It must be in there. It's not. My whole purse is missing and my medicine. Maybe-- Maybe we put it in with the music. My shot was way past due. If the cold didn't kill me, I knew for sure the diabetic coma would. What's wrong, honey? Nobody could've heard me crying except a mouse. I, um, I-- it's okay. Uh, you wouldn't understand. Maybe I would. Never can tell. Or a blind person. I'm diabetic and I don't have any insulin. That disease took my sight. I'll be danged if I let it take my life. It ain't gonna take yours neither, honey, 'cause I got enough insulin in here for both of us. Seems like that old man was there whenever I needed something on that trip. Your speaking voice is as pretty as your singing. You know me? I know exactly who you are. That's why I asked for your autograph. You're my favorite singer. I can't believe you recognize me just from hearing me speak. I see with my ears. You also sang a hymn. I'm hoping someday you'll record a gospel album. Gospel's what I love. I guess you say things in a situation like that. Things you never share with a stranger. He was a harsh man, and he couldn't tell I had this burning dream. Well, sometimes you can't see someone else's dreams. People say you should take pride, then in the next breath they say you should swallow your pride. I didn't know what to do with mine so I did the wrong thing. Oh, honey, it is so easy to do the wrong thing. Before you know it, there's no time left to do it right. We all wait too long. I don't know if I have the time. You have plenty of time. Plenty. Use it right and get some sleep. ♪♪ He had this little cross on his satchel. I just stared at that cross for hours. I knew as long as I could see it I was still alive. It was time for my shot, and I hated to wake him. (door creaking) That's when we heard the men beating on the bus door. Hey, hey! We're in here! Let us out! All right. Hey, guys, come on in. Hey, come on, everybody, let's go. Wake up. Wake up, they're coming for us. Come on. Wake up. Come on, come on, you need your medicine. Let's get you your shot. Truth was he didn't have no more insulin in that box. He gave me the last... to save my life. The man died in the night. I didn't even know he was dead. (sniffling) That man who saved my life was left inside that bus, alone in the cold and dark. Those people who came within inches of dying themselves didn't want to ride with a dead person. We left him. All alone. The men had to come back later with a wagon and get him. That's why you and Carl built the cross. A few weeks later, I was getting ready to go on stage. I'll be right there. They returned your stuff from that bus ride. Oh, that's not mine-- We've got five minutes, everyone. (sniffling) The blind man was my daddy. When I didn't see him in Nashville he got on the bus back to Conway. Why didn't you recognize him? I mean-- I hadn't seen him in over 20 years and he looked so different. He had all that white hair and a hat and I didn't know he had gone blind. He probably didn't even know I was on the bus 'til he heard my voice. Maybe he thought you all would be rescued before he had to take his own shot. No. He knew giving me his last dose could kill him. He just did it anyway. He gave his life for me and I refused to see him. I can't take back nothing I did in my life. I ain't got no family no more, but if I did, they'd come first. First before money, career, success, fame. You see, honey, you're gonna get where you're going. The question is... who's gonna be there with you? Well, we had us a good time. Thanks for coming with me. Will I ever see you again? I'll see you around. Bye-bye. Say hi to your Grandma Teeden. (door opens) How's Grandma Teeden? She's not good, honey. Daddy just talked to Grandpa Luther on the phone, and they're gonna operate tomorrow morning. I want to be there before they take her in for surgery. LeAnn. Look, I know what playing the Opry tonight means, but the Opry can wait. Grandma Teeden can't. I'll call and cancel. Would you please tell 'em a family emergency came up. Yes, I need Barton Mathers now. You call the airline and get the tickets, I'll be ready in about ten minutes. (mouthing) Okay. We've got to cancel the Opry tonight. Something's come up. I know, it's a family emergency. You remember when I was in the hospital with that infection? Mm-hmm. You and Dad were working... and Grandma Teeden slept in a chair by my bed all night. She held my hand and sang. Now, honey, we can't sing as loud in here as we do at home or in church 'cause we might bother some of the other patients. So we're gonna kind of sing in whispers. That way nobody'll hear us but the Lord. (both) ♪ Amazing grace ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ That saved a wretch ♪ Like me (man clearing throat) Would you excuse us, ma'am? I need to examine the child.

Mom and Dad are here, too. They say... I got cancer. I know, Grandma. Don't talk. I'm proud of you, honey. I seen you on TV a whole lot. Try to sleep, Grandma. Remember how we used to sing on the porch swing when you was little? I remember. You know... you're never as close to God as when you're with family. Are you still close to God, LeAnn? Do you still talk to Him every day? Yeah, Grandma. 'Cause if you're away from God, you know who moved? I moved a little, Grandma, but... I'm back now. Would you, baby? It's the medicine. She doesn't know what she's saying. I do too, Avery. Would you? I want to hear you sing one more time. I can't sing real loud like we do at home or in church, but I'll sing in a whisper.

That cancer's probably been eating at her for months. She kept saying it was indigestion. She could hardly digest a thing. How long now? Three hours and some. What you making, Grandpa? Gloves. Gonna line 'em with fur. Soft. They're for your Grandma Teeden to wear to town, when she gets well. She'll like that, Grandpa. Yep. ♪ It's just a broken wing (vocalizing) ♪ It's just a broken wing ♪ Mr. and Mrs. Rimes? She's doing fine. I think we got everything. Oh, thank the Lord. Her liver was clear and that's what we were most worried about. We won't know for sure until all the lab results are back, but I'm real satisfied. Can I see her? No, they'll be bringing her up in a little while. Your grandma's one strong woman. She came through like a trooper. I knew it. Thank you, God. Where do we go from here? Well, she is gonna need several weeks. I am gonna recommend some chemotherapy, just as a precaution. I thought you said-- Well, we got everything we can see and feel, but there can always be microscopic cells we don't catch and we don't want this thing spreading, okay? Grandma Teeden pitched a fit over that. I ain't doing it. All my hair's gonna fall out. You don't need any hair, woman. Besides I hear that baldness improves your disposition. Look it here, darlin'. They're beautiful. You can still stitch better than any old machine. I hope you like yours, too. Grandpa. It fits like a... Glove. How did you know the size of my hand? From years of holding it, darling. The next six months were the roughest yet. We were booked clear across the country. But we got our new bus, and Daddy designed it. And of course nobody could drive it but him. The record company... (indistinct conversation) (cheers and applause) The funny thing about dreams is that they really do come true, but in their own time. I was finally opening at the Grand Ole Opry. (cheering) It was thrilling, but like most good things it was going by too fast. I just wanted to stop and take it all in. Faith was right. I did get there, but the question was who was gonna be there with me? LeAnn. Just talked to the record company. They're throwing a big party after the show. They're gonna announce the release of the new record. They're very high on it. Think we're gonna get at least three big singles... Look at this place. So nervous I can barely breathe. It'll be fine. Take deep breaths. In and out, in and out. ♪ 'Til I find myself ♪ Another pot of gold ♪ I can't help the love ♪ That I deserve... Excuse me. Thanks. Honey, I know this is the big one, but I still have to ask you. Yes, Mom, I want this more than ever. (whispers, inaudible) Hey, guys, quiet time, okay? Thanks. Oh, Miss Rimes. I told you I'd get you these. Oh, great! Thank you. Can I get some more pictures tonight? (mouthing) Yeah, sure. I couldn't wait to see the photographs that night with Faith Shawn and me. What you got, honey? Oh, I can't wait for you to see these, you won't believe this. Where is she? Oh, they're lovely. She's not in them. Who? When we were here last time, I didn't tell you about it because, well, I don't know, but, anyways, I couldn't wait to get these pictures so I could show you but-- Honey, what are you talking about? Remember when Grandma Teeden got sick? Faith Shawn, I met her at the Opry, and we took pictures together and we spent a whole day together and she told me about this horrible bus accident and how her father saved her life, and-- and... she's not here. Honey, you must be mistaken. Faith Shawn died two years ago. Daddy said most folks didn't even know she had died. (applause, distant) She spent her last years with some old boy she married helping the homeless in a mission. Someone sent Daddy a clipping from a Nashville paper because he had been such a big fan. She died in an accident. Do good, honey. It's your night, Lee. She is one of the youngest country music performers to have a top ten record on all... There was a storm. She and her husband were hit by lightning, near a cross somewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss LeAnn Rimes. ♪♪ (cheers and applause) This is a very special night for me. First, because I'm finally here singing at the Grand Ole Opry. (cheers and applause) And second... well, so many country performers have grown up singing in church. I did, too, but even before that, I sang with someone very special, and she's here with me tonight-- my Grandma Teeden. (cheers and applause) She taught me that real music doesn't come from the throat, it comes from somewhere deep down. It's God, putting a holiday in your heart. May you always have a holiday in your heart. For you, Grandma.
