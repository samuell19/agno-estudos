The woman sits, still, gasping for breath in the darkness. A sliver of light appears under the door. The woman tenses as the shadow passes... then returns and stops, motionless. The door handle begins to turn. The door is gently pushed, but won’t open. The woman holds her breath staring, terrified. Morning. What time is it? 9:30. I’ll be out front in 15. - Wh... Yeah, love you, too. You look great. - Thank you. - Did Carrie stay last night? - You’re my agent, Rose, not my mother. - Oh, whatever. Maybe she can get you back to work. - Yeah, maybe. - I think we’ve squeezed every last drop out of this book, Vincent. It’s been a great ride, it’s made you famous, but it’s over. - Thank God for that. - Yeah, you...you got to start writing again soon... - I know. - okay? I need a new book released... Worldwide for Christmas. - If you don’t want me to keep saying it, just write the fucking book. - What’s your name? - Ormando. - Ormando. Thank you. - Thank you. - I love this book, Mr. Brady. - Vincent, please. What did you love about it? - Everything. Could you make it to Robyn with a "Y," please? Robyn with a "Y." - I don’t believe you did it, Mr. Brady. - Hi. What’s your name? - To Mikey, please? - Mikey. Thanks. And who would you like this to? - "To a beautiful girl, from Vincent Brady." - To a beautiful girl... Vincent... - Mr. Brady. Mr. Brady? - Sorry. - What’s your name? - Donald. - What? - Door’s open. I thought I locked it. - You did really well today. - You want a drink? You’re hilarious. - Maybe some tea, then. - Yes, please. I would love some tea. That was the last of the book signings, wasn’t it? ’Cause I’ve really had enough. - Most writers don’t make it till they’re 50. - Look at you. - Uh-huh. - Gonna see Carrie tonight? - Thought I was supposed to be writing. - Well, you are. Good boy. - I’m gonna ask her to marry me, Rose. What? Shit. Well, that was sudden. Are you sure you wanna do that again? - Yeah. - Does she know about Helen? - She doesn’t know the details. - Well, you gotta tell her. - Of course I’m gonna tell her. - Come on, Ollie. In you get. I know. I know. - - I promise you’ll be better in the morning, okay? Yeah. Stay. Stay. Yeah, sorry. Um, about to lock up now. No, I’m coming home. Be about half an hour? Okay. Sure. See you then. Bye. Night, Ollie. I’m home! - Hey! Hope you brought wine. - Heh. Of course I got wine. What’s for dinner? - Spaghetti. - Hmm. Hope you haven’t gone to too much trouble. - So come on. Tell me. Tell me all about Vincent Brady, the man, the mystery. - He’s amazing. He’s smart. He’s handsome. He’s lovely. I think he likes me a lot. - How’s the sex? - Kate. Hi. Leave a message. I’ll call you back. Hello. Vincent? Remember me? You signed my book yesterday. Pick up, Vincent. You sure you want to get involved with another woman? It didn’t end well with Helen. - Who is this? How’d you get this number? - Hello? Helen! Can I speak to Professor Carrie Johnson, please? - How are you this morning? - I’m okay. Missed you last night. - Ah, bet you got a better night’s sleep. - I sleep great when you’re here. Hey, how ’bout dinner tonight? - How about take-away at your place? - No, I want to take you somewhere nice. - Sounds good. Can’t wait. Can you wait till 7:00? - Okay. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Oh, it’s...it’s gotta be you. - Thank you. - Dirty dog. - Yeah, that’s me. - Dirty, dirty dog. - No, I’m fine. Thank you. - And what are you looking at? - Oh, nothing. - So how come you don’t drink? - I just don’t. - It’s impressive. I’m not sure I could never have another glass of wine. - So... - Mm-hmm? - I want to ask you something. - Really? - Really. Um... Will you? - Well, well! This looks like a heavy moment. Did you say yes, darlin’? I’ll be the stripper. - Come on. I’ll be the stripper here now. - And what’s your problem, lover boy? - Rodney, don’t. Come on, then. Fuck off. - Come on. Let’s just go. - Oh, don’t cut his lunch, Rodney. - Come on, man. - Come on, then. - Come on, Rodney. Back to the game, man. Let’s go. Yeah, yeah. Get another Sparry in you. - - I was pretty much an alcoholic when she died. That’s why I really stopped. - Did she have a long illness? No, she was murdered. - Oh, Vincent, that’s horrible. - I thought you would have known. Everyone else seems to. Ah, the media blamed me. It was all over the Web. No one was ever charged, so I guess I’ll never know who did it or why. - I’m so sorry. - Carrie, I... just don’t want to lose you. - I’m not going anywhere. Thank you, sir. Nice night. Should have put on my naughty hat. - Maybe. Okay. - - Vincent Brady? My name’s James Mitchell. Could I have a word with you, sir? In private, please. - What about? - Well, it’s a private matter, sir. If you would, Mr. Brady? - You go on. I’ll be up in a minute. - Okay. - I think you know what this is about. - This was dealt with two years ago. - No, this is a private investigation on behalf of your deceased wife’s family. As you know, there’s a great deal of money involved, and you are the sole beneficiary. - I made it clear I’m not interested in the money. - Well, maybe some new evidence will be of interest to you. - What new evidence? - Recognize him? It’s a frame taken from a CCTV video near your house in Pacific Heights on the night your wife was murdered. That’s you. - It’s not possible. - Keep it. It’s a copy. - Look, I was nowhere near the house at the time. - So you said. You knew she was having an affair, didn’t you? - Who are you? Fuck you. What do you know? - Let me tell you what I know. You slit your wife’s throat, and I’m gonna prove it. - What was that about? - He’s a private investigator. - What did he want? - Oh, nothing. Nothing to worry about. - Okay. I’ll give you something to worry about. - You all right? I love you. Do you want some water? Thanks. Yeah, we should definitely get her in. Yeah, she’s self-published. Mm-hmm. Hey, can I call you back in half an hour? Okay, bye. What’s up? - I need to talk. Hey, Henry. I had this guy come and see me last night. He’s working for Helen’s family. He came all the way from the States. - Are you a suspect again? - I think I am. He’s got a CCTV picture that’s turned up... says it’s me. Sure looks like me. - That’s just crap, Vincent. You were miles away when she was killed. They’ve trawled through all of this before. - I know that, but this guy worries me. I don’t think he’s gonna stop. - We’re on the other side of the world, okay? He has no authority here. - He says he’s working with the police, plans to take me back to stand trial. - Look... grab Carrie and your laptop, and go up to Timbarra for a couple of weeks. Lay low for a while. You can get to know each other properly, and, more importantly, you can write the fucking book. - I’m going up this afternoon for a few days, but I promise I won’t get in your way. Okay? - Okay. Thanks, Rose. - Come here. - Bye, Henry. Thank you. - Mr. Vincent Brady? - Yeah, that’s me. - I have a pickup for you. - Well, who organized this? - One sec. Let me check. Uh, Ms. Rose Conway. A reading at the Queen’s Theatre. - Rose, it’s me. I thought we were done with everything. Just call me when you get this. Where do I go? - The backstage entrance is just through here. - How long’s this gonna take? - I’m not sure. - Thought this was meant to be a reading. Where is everyone? - I’m not sure. I guess they’ll be here shortly. Need anything while we wait? - No, I’m fine. - Perhaps we could read a small excerpt from your book. Chapter six? "The red curtain is drawn to reveal a woman." - What is this? - Sit down, or she dies. - "...a woman." "Her hands are tied." "The man lifts the blade to her neck." "She shivers, cold steel on warm skin." "She closes her eyes, perhaps for the last time." - No! - Hello, Vincent. - Hi. this is Rose. I’m unavailable at the moment. If you leave a message, I’ll call you back. - Hi. Rose... I got a problem. I need to talk to you. Call me. Fuck. Hi. Leave a message. I’ll call you back. Maybe going to the cops wouldn’t be a great idea. She’s a beautiful woman, Vincent. I think she likes me. - Carrie, Carrie, it’s okay. It’s okay. It’s me. It’s okay. - Oh, my gosh, you scared me. - I’m sorry. I needed to see you. Maybe next time, you can call and tell me when you’re coming over at 3 A.M. in the morning. - I just... needed to see that you were okay. - What are you talking about? Are you okay, Cass? - Uh, yeah, I’m fine. Vincent’s here. It’s okay. You can go back to bed, Kate. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. - Come to bed. - I can’t. I...I got things to do in the morning. - You’re being strange. How come you didn’t stay and talk to me at work today? I mean, the flowers were beautiful, but... you just looked straight at me and walked away. - There’s things I need to tell you. - Okay. - I want us to spend some time together alone. - So you came here in the middle of the night to tell me that? - Rose has offered us her place in the country. It’s beautiful up there, and we’ll have it all to ourselves. - Okay. Sounds good. Stay. - I wish I could. - Fine. - I’ll book some flights. We can go up Saturday morning. I love you. - Well? - This is the last time we’re gonna meet. That’s a lot of money. She never told you about me, did she? - No. - I could have been you. Anyone can write a fuckin’ book. I got an idea for you. Wanna hear it? - No. - So there’s these two brothers... exactly the same in every way. And one day... when they’re about two years old, their mother... she runs off to America. She takes her favorite son with her, but the other one, her other son, abandoned, forgotten. And one brother has everything. He’s happy. The other brother has fucking nothing. He’s not...happy. - Take the money. Get out of my life. - I’m not sure this is gonna cover it. Carrie... she’s special, isn’t she... kind, very attractive. - If you go anywhere near her again... I’ll kill you. Vincent... we’re brothers. Oh, hi. It’s me. I know you wanna talk, but I’m flying to Timbarra today, so if you and Carrie are coming up, we can talk on Saturday? See you there. - - Hi. Like to speak to Detective Roberts, please. - Yep. - He’s expecting me. Tell him James Mitchell is here. - Just wait here, please. - Okay. Hey. Boss said you might be interested in this. Come in. - How long has she been dead, Detective? - Not sure. We think about three days. - Anything else? Prints? DNA? - "To a beautiful girl, from Vincent Brady." Coincidence? - Maybe. It’s so quiet. - That’s Henry. He’s the master of the house. Rose? - Hello. How are you? - Rose? Rose, you here? She’s probably gone into town. Come on. - Henry, come on, boy. Come on. - We’re in here. How ’bout I show you around? - All right. Hello. This is Carrie. Leave a message, and I’ll get back to you. - Hi. This is Kate. - Hi. Could I speak to Carrie, please? - Uh, she’s not home. Sorry. Who’s calling? - Uh, this is James Mitchell. I’m a friend of Vincent’s. - Could you tell me how I could find them, please? - Uh, sure. They are on a property out in the country, uh, Timbarra. I think there’s a land line attached to the house. If you look it up, you should find it. - Thank you. - No worries. - What’s going on in there? - There’s a couple of things I haven’t bothered you with. - Well... I actually want to be bothered, so... bother me. - I love you. - I love you, too. So how’s it going? - Yeah, good, really good. - Bullshit, Cass. What’s wrong? - I don’t know. He’s just complicated. Sometimes I just can’t reach him. - It all sounds way too hard to me, hmm? Oh, by the way, uh, an American friend of Vincent’s rang, James somebody. Uh, I gave him the name of the property, and I think he’s gonna call. I hope that’s okay. - Yeah, I’m sure that’s fine. Look... this guy loves me, and I think he needs me. - Oh, you mean like a dog? That’s not fair. - Sorry. It’s your life, my love. We’ll talk tomorrow. I love you. - You, too. See you. Henry! Henry, come back! Okay. - Hi. - Vincent! Vincent? Vincent, are you here? What was that? - What? - It’s never been like that before. - You hungry? - Yeah, I guess I am. - Cheers. - Cheers. What’s wrong? - Nothing. - Okay. - So you didn’t like my cooking? - Oh, it’s fine. I... just wasn’t that hungry after all. - Have I done something wrong? - No. I think I’m... I think I’m gonna go to bed. I might sleep in another bedroom. I’m just, um... I’m really tired, and I need to get a good sleep. - Really? - Yeah. But I’ll see you in the morning. So what’s changed? I don’t know. He’s just strange. Something about the way he looks at me, it’s different, kind of dark. - Okay, now you’re scaring me. - Think I’m gonna come home tomorrow. - I told you you didn’t know him well enough. Shit, you sure know how to pick ’em, don’t you? - That’s not helping. - His first wife was killed, right? And they never found out who did it. - Kate, please. - Okay. I’m sorry, but I’m worried. I better go. - I’ll see you tomorrow. - Okay, well, let me know... - I’m gonna go home in the morning. - Why? - I think we need some time apart. I’ll need you to drive me into town. Please don’t make this difficult. I’ll see you in the morning. Good night. - Sit down. - I’m going to bed. Wait! Wait! Shit. Shit. Yes! Oh, shit! Oh, Henry. - Miss Rose, are you there? It’s Pete. Oh. Oh, hello, Mr. Brady. I didn’t know you were here. Uh, Miss Rose really likes my tomatoes, so I thought I’d bring some over for her. Uh, is she around anywhere, sir? - No. She went out walking. - Oh. Must have taken the dog with her. Uh, would you give her these, please? Well, I told Miss Rose I’d take a look at that, uh, pump on the water tank while I was here, so I’ll go check that out now. Ah, dear God. Carrie. - Oh, my God. - Wait! Wait! - What? - He’s my brother. Where’s Carrie? Have you seen her? She just ran off. - Maybe she just doesn’t like you. - No. Yesterday we had sex. She loved it. - She would have called the police. They’ll be here soon. What do you want? - I’ve been watching you. I know you. I’m going to be Vincent Brady. And you’re gonna be my long-lost brother. You killed my wife... all those people. What kind of person are you? I should go. I need to find Carrie. I’m worried about her. Hope she’s okay. - I tried to give him money, but he wouldn’t take it. He’s sick. - Oh, God. Vincent... Rose is dead. - Vincent Brady. Yes. I have a twin brother. - Really? Move away from the door. Keep your fucking hands up! - Please, you don’t understand. Put your hands together. - Okay. - So who’s the dead guy in the garden? - Well, I’ve got no idea. You need to talk to my brother. - Sit. Down. - You’ve got it all wrong. Oh, yeah? ...police station. - Yeah, I wanna talk to Senior Sergeant Robinson, please. - Would you mind holding? - Yeah. I can wait. - I wouldn’t go in there. Oh, yeah? Fuck you. - - Yeah, I’m waiting to talk... Hello? Are you there? - Excuse me, sir. Are you there? Hello? James Mitchell. You are dying. - I’m going back to the house to get a phone. - No, you’re not. - Yes, I am. I’ll be okay. He’s out there looking for me. Are there any other phones in the house? - Uh, there’s a house phone and a cellphone in the desk by the bed. - Gotta go. - Where are you? - Shit. - Hello. Who is this? - It’s Kate. Is Carrie with you? - No, she went back to the city. She was in a hurry to make her flight. Looks like she left her phone behind. I’ll send it back when I can. - Well, her flight arrived here hours ago, and she wasn’t on it. I’m starting to get really worried. - Look, we had a fight. She left. That’s all I know. Fuck! - Arsehole! - Hello. This is Carrie. Leave a message, and I’ll get back to you. Shit! - I heard a shot. I thought he killed you. - No, I’m fine. I’m fine. - Did you find your phone? - I-It’s not working. He’s killed someone else. - What? - That man from outside your apartment. Vincent? - There you are. I was worried about you. - Vincent! Vincent! - Get the car keys! Go! - Vincent. - Go! - Vincent? Is that you? Vincent? - Yeah, it’s me. Carrie, it’s me. It’s me. Where are the keys? - I... - Shit. Where are the keys? - I couldn’t find them, but... - We’d better start walking. - Why? Vincent, you shot him, didn’t you? Vincent! - I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t kill him. - Unh! Pathetic! - Don’t move. - Here. Bet you can do it. - Do it. Do it. Shoot him! Vincent! - You’re the strong one. You can do it. Please. Vincent. Vincent. - She didn’t make a sound. I cut her throat, and she just... looked at me. She had this strange expression on her face. Not pain. Just sort of... "Why?" She thought she was looking at you. - Vincent. Vincent! Vincent! - Vincent! Vincent! No! Carrie! - Carrie. Carrie, you okay? Are you hurt? You okay? It’s okay. - Vincent. - You’re safe now. Okay? Lie down. You okay? You’re safe. Hey. It’s okay. - I love you. I love you, Vincent. I love you. Oh, Vincent. I love you. - Vincent. Vincent. It’s okay. Okay. Vincent. The paramedics put him into the waiting ambulance. She watches as the brother’s covered body is taken to another vehicle. The ambulance doors close, and the flashing vehicle speeds off, lighting up the night.
