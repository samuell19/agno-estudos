SOMEONE IS BLEEDING The cries... of the seagulls. The great... silence. The great silence... safe and comfortable. My ass. When she was... fairly... near... Comma. He recognised Claire. I don't believe it. You won't believe it. I wrote something silly. Pardon? It's incredible. The beach, the sea, the gulls... my hero walking... and he meets my heroine. I stopped there. Verging on depression. It's impossible, writing such stuff. It doesn't exist. But it does exist. You're proof. Thank you. You're a writer? Not really. I write TV soaps. Bang! That's me! I'm as much like a writer as... the Louvre is like a phone box. I'm paid union rates of 120 francs a minute. Imagine Shakespeare writing Hamlet for 120 francs a minute? You watch TV? - Never. - Good. We can remain friends. The fact... You share with Claire, my heroine... that you're walking alone on a beach in winter. But... Claire had a reason to. Do you? Claire was strolling on the beach because... she's just had a primary infection. The man she loves... sent her to rest on the coast. And you? - Did you have an infection? - No. And Claire's a dental surgeon. She's engaged, marrying soon. I'm already married. At the end of the episode, Claire gazes at Ralph... my hero... and gives him her phone number. Hey! Damn. Do you come here often? Be nice and leave me alone. I came into your car like you came into my life. I haven't written for 3 days. No. Wait. 26 minutes. I lost 26 minutes of soap because of you. You owe me 3000... francs. Ah, no. No, no. But in fact, I left. I left my heroine sick and shivering on the beach. Hose’s still there. So if you don't... want Claire to catch cold... and you do want millions of TV viewers... to catch my eighth episode... give me your number. I'll produce 52 minutes in a day. And dedicate it to you. What's your name? Why? For the announcement. Peggy. Peggy. I'll write on the screen: "But for Peggy, this episode wouldn’t have happened. " Is your husband here? I'm divorced. Better, but not much. I can't quite build your character. Help me out here because. You didn't have infection... and you're not a dentist. What are you doing in Nice in winter? Can't I call you somewhere? Be nice. Get out and leave me alone. OK. But I'll lie in the gutter, and cry. Don't be silly. All right, then. But I'll lie in the gutter. Are you all right? Yes. Why? What are those two cows on about? 88... 10... 01. See you soon. 88-10-01, 88-10-01... Miss Lister. - Who's asking? - François Rollin. You are to wait in the sitting room. François... Yes. I'm upstairs. Come up, if you like. Hello. Isn't he sweet. He closed the gate on my foot. They make good ones in plastic nowadays. Tell me... where did you find him? For his age, he stands on his hind legs very well. Does he bark at night or is he calm? He knocked on my door last night. No! I could hearing him breathing. He waited there for an hour. And? I didn’t let him in. You have to sack him. Shall we go? I've a soap on Europe 1 at the moment. This is it: The Loves of Cardinal de Richelieu. It was I who... I loved you from the start. That's Richelieu. Me too, Armand du Plessis. With Splash... Super activated washing powder with gamma rays... I told them not to mix... detergents and Richelieu. But it seems they pay for the soap. And me too. What if I told you I'd never sleep with you? Would it be that fun? Don't say that. What I like about you is... you use humour not hands. OK.I get it. No matter. Can we be friends? I'll wait as long as it takes. We'll sleep together tomorrow. We're being followed. You don't have to drive so fast. Easy. There's no one there. The car, look out! The bike! Truce... The truck! Road hog! Scum! Were we really being followed? I want to go home. Right. I'd like to see you again... Tomorrow evening. "Peggy, last night a man was at your house. Was he: One: your husband? "Two: a lover? Three: the plumber? "Strike out those that don't apply... "And call me soon... I miss you... "Signed: François. " You're stupid. It's just my lawyer. He saw to my divorce. François, I’m sorry. I can't dine with you tonight. Don't ask me to explain. It's impossible. I'll call you, I promise. Miss Lister, please. Albert! Let Mr Rollin in. Please. What have I done to you? I've been waiting 3 days. When I call, they say you've gone out. We meet, we’re inseparable, and then you vanish. Don't laugh, Peggy. It's not good. No. I'm sorry. It's not at all good. Why a glass of water? Why not? I'm not really thirsty, but... Why the silence? Tell me what's going on, Peggy. I can't. Come on, let’s go for a spin. Did you think of me? I thought of you all the time. Yes, I did. That's silly, then. We think of each other but don't see each other. Shall we go? No. Not now. Later. Right. I'll pick you up in an hour. No, I’ll pick you up at your place. The key's in the lock. Wait for me if I'm not in. François... I'm glad you came. Go and work now. Mr Francois Rollin, please. Yes. Miss Lister sent me. What? Miss Lister sent me! Please come in! What's it about? Miss Lister couldn't come herself. She sent me to drive you to counsellor Rilson. - Her lawyer? - Yes. Oh. I'll tell Sir. Whom should I announce? Mr Rollin. François Rollin. Would Sir wait an instant? Mr Francois Rollin is here. If Sir would be so good as to enter. Mr Rollin? Marc Rilson. Miss Lister's lawyer. Delighted. My brother Denis Mr Rollin. Do sit down. Would you like a drink? No, thanks. Isn't Miss Lister here? Denis, leave us for a minute. Sorry to have brought you here. but I wanted to speak to you about Miss Lister. These last 5 years, anything that remotely affects her... concerns me directly. Just what do you know about her? What? Has she spoken about herself? Her life ? her past? I don't understand. She didn't tell you I looked after her business? Yes. You settled her divorce. Divorce? She's not divorced? Miss Lister has been very ill, Mr Rollin. She's convalescing now. Ill? She's in perfect heath. A few years ago, she married a junkie... who shared with her his taste for drugs. Her addiction triggered a neurosis... whose psychological after-effects are still with her... In particular... her understandable disgust for men. She has been on several detox courses. But we don't know if she'll recover. What is all this? It's hard to believe... but I can show you her psychiatric file. I overheard... a little of your conversation. There's one thing my brother omitted to tell you... I doubt it's in her file. It's that he loves her... and wants to marry her. Denis is also forgetting a detail: Mr Rilson is already married. I am Mrs Rilson. Whoa...! Right. Could you take me back? I didn't lie to you. Miss Lister has been very ill. You must leave her alone,Mr Rollin. Have you fixed a wedding date? I didn't want it to come to this. To what? She's not divorced, she’s a widow. Her husband was murdered. What? She murdered him. Yes. She was acquitted... after a medical enquiry. But that doesn't mean she's cured. Can I go? - Steig. - Yes, sir. Take Mr Rollin home. Very good, sir. - Drop me at Miss Lister's. - Very good, sir. That's absurd. You believed him? Well... I don't know. Why did you come back? To find out the truth. I told you the truth. I'm a widow. My husband is dead. You said you were divorced. Because it was simpler... I don't tell my life story as easily as you. And I'm not paid 120 francs a minute for melodrama. OK, then. I slit my husband's throat. Blood on my hands. You don't belong here. Look, Peggy. I don't know... I'm not to blame here. Of course. It's child's play. Shit! Of course... it's an infantile tactic. He wants to separate us. Why else would you send him to him? Oh, I'm stupid. But he's easily believed. And the staging... It was incredible. I couldn't write anything like it. He had everything: the chalk, the billiard cue... the icy stare, the neurotic wife, the degenerate brother... Mummy Dracula, Uncle Frankenstein and their youngest. Peggy, this isn't serious. Her lawyer is the villain in the movie... And besides he wants her to marry him. It's nothing. Just a draught. Take me away. Please. I don't want to stay here. But why? I'm scared. He tried to get in my room again. I constantly hear him breathing at my door. Take me away. I'm scared. Hey, relax. We'll find you a flat. You're right, this big house is sinister. Why did you choose such a place? Marc rented it for me. Oh,Marc? My lawyer, counsellor Rilson. When my husband died, he saw to everything... He's never asked for a thing in exchange. The sea's lullaby, the sun to wake you.. The gulls will say hello. You'll love it here. How much is it? The 7th floor is just 1500 francs... and the 12th: 2000 francs. It's a higher floor. The prices are higher. It's normal. - Phone call for you. - Be right there. Excuse me. Hello.. Yes. Of course. That's right. Yes. Right. OK. Look at the terrace.. I'm sorry, the flat on the 12th has just been taken. - And the 7th? - Rented too. Just now. - What else do you have? - Well, you know... At the first sign of sun... the owners come. You can't blame them. - Sorry, I’ve nothing else. - Come on. Calm down, Peggy Look, no one's following us. You're not in danger now. I am. I know we're being followed. Since he got him out of prison, he's devoted. - Who? - Steig,his chauffeur. He'd do anything for him. Hope someone's in. FLATS TO LET Offices in show flat,3rd floor. It's brand new, anyway. 100 francs says small, fat and a moustache. Or bald with a plastic raincoat. Or a dwarf with a red beard. Anyone there? Nobody. I'm sure it's brighter in the daytime. You'll be fine here. Just fine. Well, we can't hang around all day. It gets complicated Lighter. Ow. What's wrong with these buttons? We're going back down. What do you know! This lift has got a mind of its own. Dynamic, young, mischievous. Keep the button pressed. I'll put on the light. Press. I'm looking for the timer. But I can't find it. I've found it. I press the button and... no light. We'll have to ask for a rent reduction. Here we are. I've found the timer. Francois! Francois? What's happened to you? Are you hurt? I was attacked. Attacked? - Long ago? - Where is she? Peggy! Are you looking for someone? Peggy! He won't bother you now. I think he's understood. But there's a problem. She was very scared. Excuse me, it’s noisy. I don't know. She disappeared. You have to find her, Albert. Call me when you have news. Night has just fallen, we come upon an ambush. I've been hurt... I beg your pardon? Marc was amazing. He carried me for 2km. Guns going off everywhere. The gunfire raged on. I had 14 fragments in my leg. 2 kilometres. You were 10 kilos heavier then! In any case, time seemed eternal to me. To me too. Listen to the veterans! Better than being discharged. We'd all have been better off being discharge. Excuse me. The weather was awful. Peggy, dear. He touched me. I'm scared.. I'm dirty. He touched me with his dirty hands. Yes? Put him on. She's at my place. She was attacked. And scared. You could have defended her. I told you to leave her alone, Rollin! It was Steig. It was Steig. He's been tailing me for 2 months. It's your fault. Come along, now. I ripped his eyes out. I hope he's blind. It was Steig. It was! - Steig! - No. Steig has no reason to attack you. He's there to protect you. I trust him implicitly. Come in. Sir? Thank you, Steig. See? Anyone could have attacked you. Marc? They are waiting. - I'll take you home. - No. - Why not? - I'm scared. No. Albert's there. - That's who I'm scared of. - No. No. Albert, Steig,... you see evil everywhere. The person who attacked you will regret it. Nobody will lay a hand on you as long as I'm alive. Don't you trust me? There, Peggy? - Can I come in? - No. We'll talk tomorrow. I need to sleep. - Do you want me to stay? - No. I'm much better. Goodnight. Goodnight. What exactly happened? Please, not tonight. I'm tired. - But I... - Don't keep on. I'll call you. She's scared in this house. I told you to leave her alone. It's up to her to tell me. Albert. Albert... Ow! What the.. Miss. Miss. It's Miss Lister. Hello, Peggy? It was him in the parking lot. His face is scratched. I can hear him behind the door. I've locked myself in my room. I can hear him. I can hear him breathing. Come! Come quick. Quick! Come quick. Quick! Quick! Stay there, Peggy. I'll be right there. Steig. Peggy... What's going on? Albert attacked us. It wasn't Steig. His face is bloody. He's been scratched. I don't want to go back there. You won't go back there. You can move in here tomorrow. Is that better? I don't want to go back. I told you, move in here. Wait. Wait... I'll lend you some pyjamas. They may be a little large... But nice pyjamas. When you arrived, I was dreaming that a rhinoceros was... What have I done with my pyjamas? Quick, the door. It's him Lock the door! - Shall I see? - Don't leave me. Just a glance. It's nothing! Just a couple. She's old and disgusting. Always bringing young boys back to her 3rd floor flat. What are you doing in your corner? Let's sort this out. I've lost my pyjamas. I'll find them.. There! A little shirt will do. Come here. You take my bed. I'll sleep in the armchair. I'll sleep in the armchair. But don't be afraid. It's nothing. It's a nightmare. It'll all be forgotten tomorrow. It's true, you know. It's vast. You can buy thousands of hectares, there's nobody there. We can settle on a farm. And live there, totally alone. They're good. Here. It's funny. When I was little, I thought they walked upside down. It's the other side of the earth. You want a grapefruit juice? A farm must be marvellous. Living alone. Nobody there. Australia must bore you stiff. I'd rather be bored stiff there than tired of life here. Oh... That's great. I'll note it down. "Bored stiff in Australia... Tired of life here. " I'll work that one in. OK,then. We'll go to Australia and live upside down. Like this. Hello? It's me. Hang on. I'll put counsellor Rilson on. Sir. I know she's with you, Mr Rollin. They found the body of her gardener. The police were tipped off anonymously. It's a murder. She must return home. - Miss Lister lives here. - I'll go with here. They'll ask you questions. Above all, don’t panic. That bastard tried to rape her last night. A motive to send her to prison. Hello, Miss Lister. Commissioner Garnier. Do you have a minute? She spent the night with you. None of your business. I'm not asking, I’m telling. You're her alibi, fool. Stop insulting me. Stop being dramatic. This chat is a formality. It's more than a chat. It's a hearing. And more serious than you imagine. Damn! Do be careful. Sorry, sir. Mr Rollin? Miss Lister says she spent the night at your place. That's right. You'll have to drop into the office this afternoon And don't leave the area without telling us. What does it means? Why are we being treated as criminals? That's a good question, Mr Rollin. I did warn you. She murdered her husband. You wouldn’t believe me. I even made you laugh. She told me everything, you know. Frankenstein, Dracula... Melodrama exists in life. You're paid to know that. Why did you lie to me? Because I want to keep you. Come on, I’ll take you home. Let's go. With a case! A brown skirt. It doesn't suit me at all. Three pullovers. A coffee-coloured slip... Yes? I must take you to the station. To record your statement. I'll come too, commisaire. Of course, counsellor. Take my car. We'll meet at your place. Francois? I've done nothing wrong. And I love you. Do you really need to take her? I won't keep her long. I promise. She doesn't need this. Questions, police... And I'm the police? She's in good hands. Don't worry. It'll all be fine, Peggy. Why did you go to him? What? When things are bad, you usually come to me. Why did you go to him? The last episode was filthier than the one before? Well good.. That's because I met my heroine on a beach. No, I’m serious. I met this lovely woman and ever since... I've been shut in lifts, beaten up... and everyone around me is being killed. No, I’m not drunk. I'm as sober as a judge. Yes, yes, yes. And she has the most attractive lawyer in Europe. If I met him in a dress, I’d marry him. Oh. Excuse me, it’s her. Call you back. I'm Mrs Rilson. We have met before. Oh, yes... Indeed. I'd like to talk to you. May I come in? Of course. I want to understand. Good. So do I. My husband won't enlighten me, of course. He never says much about this business or his affairs. But perhaps you... Have you slept with her? Pardon? No. Definitely not. Nobody's slept with her... Not you, nor him. Denis, my husband's brother tried a few months ago. One night, he went into her room. He left her room with his arm bleeding. Five stitches. She's a mad criminal, terribly dangerous. She is! And everyone loves her... How does she do it? Tell me that. Why did you come to tell me this? I'll give you some advice. Take her far away, as soon as possible. So you get your husband back and everyone's happy. Isn't it? I don't know. If she stays, everyone will be very unhappy. Including you. Take her away. Sir. I've come for Miss Lister's luggage. - Did she ask you to? - No, Counsellor Rilson did. I don't care what he says. This is my home, and you can clear off. - Give me that! - Don't make this harder... Get out! Out, fatso! Stop it,Steig! I was wrong. You can do nothing against him. He won't let her go. Go... Stop! The little whore is here. Would you like a drink? An orange juice. Hello, Miss Lister. Where should we put your luggage? My luggage? Yes,Peggy, I sent Steig for your things. You could have told me. You don't need him now. You shall live here. In what room? - I owe him an explanation. - Why? Do you want to phone him? No, Marc. You've always let me decide for myself. I'd rather go to his place. Shall I come? No. There's no need. - Shall I take you? - No, thanks. Sir, Miss Lister has gone. I know, Steig. Thank you. Mr Denis left right afterwards, following her. I saw them go. Denis has been looking for revenge on Miss Lister. And you. Peggy... Where is she? She took her cases and left. - Where? - Your place. They all went to your place: Husband, brother, chauffeur... I warned you of trouble. I'm afraid I was right. Here. I made some coffee. Would you like some? Yes. Mr Denis Rilson is at your place. Dead. Murdered. Bring a few essentials with you, Mr Rollin. Last night at 7pm, you called on Mr Rilson... and saw Mrs Rilson. Yes. Mrs Rilson denies seeing you. She's lying. I went to fetch Miss Lister, last night at 7pm. Mr Rilson and his chauffer... almost ran me down. Neither of them remembers. Mr Rilson is trying to nail me. But you can't believe I killed his brother. You got there before me. There are early indications that... the crime was committed an hour before I arrived. You could have murdered Denis Rilson, left... and come back an hour later. Commissioner, you received an anonymous call. Mrs Rilson destroys my alibi... Come one. It's a frame-up. The dagger, the murder weapon... belongs to you. The dead man was at your place. There's a tie. How long will I be here? Between 24 hours and 40 years. - I want a lawyer. - What? I'll call counsellor Rilson. Pardon? You asked to speak to me, Mr Rollin? The only way out for me is to accuse her. I can also say what your wife told me. Which is? Denis's wound and the stitches. I can also say Peggy had come back when the crime was committed. You've dropped me in it. Now get me out. This is far more risky for her than for me. This is blackmail. And you, perjury... you denied my alibi. You want her back? Me too. Where will I get you? I was wondering the same about you. Mr Rollin, you are free. Mrs Rilson's memory returned? Mrs Rilson confirmed certain points of your statement... that clear you of any guilt. I'd like to see Miss Lister. Can you tell me where? Why? It's personal. She's with counsellor Rilson. I'll come with you, if you don't mind. Why? Professional reasons. I'm a police commissioner. I've two bodies and no killer. Peggy... Yes? We have to leave now. Come on. I want to say goodbye to Francois. We've no time to lose. He wouldn't understand that I'd just leave like this. I beg you. I'm scared, Marc. Scared? Scared of what? I don't want to go back to hospital. That's out of the question! You'll never go back to hospital. You're cured now. We'll go away together... both... far... away. The other end of the earth. - Where they walk upside down? - Yes. Where they walk upside down. Where there are no barriers. Where nobody knows us. Come in. Mr Rollin and the commissioner are here. Good morning, counsellor. Please excuse our unheralded arrival. Without warning. Where are you taking her? Where she can rest. She needs it. I'm sorry... but I need her. What's going on commissioner? My investigation is going on... and I need to be able to confront all the witnesses. As long as I haven’t found the murderer. I’m compelled to ask you all to stay. And, of course, I must ask a few questions to... Miss Lister. What with the condition she’s in? That cannot be avoided. Or it must be acknowledged that her physical condition prevents her... from answering a normal... interrogation. Nonetheless you’ll grant me that two murders in one’s circle of friends... may justify many depressive conditions. I might just ask her a few questions here, then... Yes, it will prevent the anguish... of official dealings. Don't leave me, Marc. I'm here, my dear. You left here at 6pm yesterday... in a car, to visit... Mr Rollin's house, in Antibes... We'll forget your meeting with Mr and Mrs Rilson... though it didn't go very well. Miss Lister! You left this house... and headed towards Antibes... closely followed by Mr Denis Rilson... counsellor Rilson himself soon after set off in the same direction. You arrived in Antibes around 7pm... the time at which Mr Rollin was arriving here. Around 7.15pm... Mr Rollin's neighbour saw you on the stairs. It all points to you visiting Mr Rollin. And at the same time... Mr Denis Rilson's car... Eric! I killed my brother Denis. And Albert, Peggy's gardener. I'm at your disposal... commissioner. It's a dead end, Marc. You can't do anything for her. Blood was found on her clothes... I'll get the lab reports tomorrow... and she'll go back to hospital. For life... You shouldn't have done that. She's beyond help. She's free because of you. Give me 24 hours, Eric. What? I need 24 hours. I'll sort everything out. I can't do that, Marc. Really. Eric, please. Damn! Thanks, Eric. Not too tired? We'll soon be at the hotel. When we're married, it'll all be in the past. You'll give me children, I'll give you soaps. Our children will watch my soaps... and my soaps will feed them. Steig? Where are they? I'm tailing them. They're headed for Turini Pass. - Where? - Turini Pass. I'm on my way. Turini Pass. Ah, commissioner! News about counsellor Rilson's disappearance. Oh. We've traced a conversation between his car... Cadillac 7185 LG 06... and the Villeneuve-Loubet phone box. Hello? You recorded the conversation in the Cadillac? Right. Turini Pass? Call the police station at L'Escarene. TURINI PASS. Number 9. Our nicest room. Thank you. What name? Mr & Mrs Francois Rollin. OK? Not too tired? I'm OK. Please come this way. The chef has left... but rest assured we'll spoil you. You can eat by the fireside in your room. A lover's repast. Fancy a drink? No. Hungry? No. You mustn't be sad. He wanted to paint you as a sick criminal. Put him out of your thoughts. Shall we order champagne? To celebrate your being well. Because... you're well now. Hello, reception? Can you bring up some champagne? Yes. That's perfect. Thank you. Peggy! You're trembling. You're crazy! I came looking for you Peggy It's over, don't worry. I'm here. I'm here. Come here, come... We have to hurry. We don't have much time. No, Steig. Thank you. ORIENTATION PANEL Look, Australia. It's there at last... I'll take you. Let's both leave. We'll buy a farm... An immense one... We'll be alone... for thousands of kilometres. We'll have to learn to walk with our heads down.
