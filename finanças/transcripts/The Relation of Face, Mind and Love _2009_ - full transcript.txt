Seaside or city, I want a place that has both an office and living quarters. And make me a block of wood, so I can start carving. And if they offer a separate office and separate housing, beat them down. Oh, and tell Michael not to get too caught on up on the art museum's exterior, but to review the functional aspect too. That's an order. There is nothing wrong. But you might have a perception difficulty. Meaning you might see a beauty as a beast, or a beast as a beauty. But after a day or two you will be back to normal. Don't worry. [MIND AND LOVE] You have waited a long time, I, Wang Seo Jung, am here. I'm coming. Hello. She works in our neighborhood, Wang Seo Jung. Right. Hello. Nice meeting you. Starting from now, I am going to follow the leader. Over here, 500 ml please. Yes. I am a reporter for an animal club, Wang Seo Jung. Today, I filmed a cat's love scene. Aren't you interested? Then in the afternoon I filmed a doggie bed scene. What is that? Be careful. Then in the end I filmed a love triangle scene with a snake, but the snake wasn't feeling good. Is it true that there are a lot of people raising snakes? If you get one to sleep with, your fever goes away. It is good. It is like sleeping with a cold woman. Depending on your preference, you might like it. Filming must be hard, since the animals don't listen that well. Not at all. Not being able to communicate with the animals is good. Unlike humans who say, "hurry up and scram". "Shut up. Ugly". They don't say that. Oh the beer is here. Everybody let's say cheers. For Seo Jung who worked really hard, Cheers! Cheers! Baby snake, Leonardo~ Odori, the female dog who seduces the male dog. Seo Jung, is it okay for her to drink like that? That is how she does it. Really? You must be really tired, Kang Tae Pung. Seeing how such a beauty looks like this. Hey there. Hey. Lady are you... Hey, are you okay? Hey. Hey. Would you like some water? Are you awake? Thank you for earlier. I drank a lot. Why? Why did you drink so much? A beauty like yourself. A beauty? Just tell me, you will feel better afterward. Sorry, we just met. Why am I like this? Are you leaving already? You are... the goddess of my dreams. A goddess? If you wanna go, I will take you. Are you saying that I am a goddess? Yes. Because you are the only one here. Are you okay? I feel dizzy. See, you can't leave yet. Please get stable. Stable. Stable?

What to do? Are you feeling better? Doing this is not good. Should we go to the police? Shut your face, idiot-driver! Your name? Wang Seo Jung. Wang Seo Jung. We will go to my house. Samong-dong. Driver. For now, go straight. Just a moment. Water. - Water? - Water. One second. - Bathroom. - Bathroom? Bathroom. One second. Bathroom. This way. This way. This way. Wait a second. We're almost there. We're here. We're here. We're here. Wait. Is there something I can help you with? Your bag. Necktie. Is there something I can help you with? What luck! I wore my special meeting good luck charm panties! Are you okay in there? Hey, are you okay? Yes. I am okay. I'm coming in. What's wrong? Are you hurt? Hey. Seo Jung? Seo Jung? My head hurts. Your head? Head, where? Head. Is there something for that? Ouch, head. Do you like French wine? Before when I was in France to study, I enjoyed drinking this wine. Where am I? At the most crucial point, sleeping. La Finale de Venezia The Grand Prix Awards. Such a waste. In my strike zone, perfectly in the exact middle. She is the perfect woman. Today, I am going to cancel all of my appointments and concentrate on my goddess. Of course, I already called my secretary. The goddess has awoken. Could this be an aftereffect of yesterday's accident? Hello. I am sorry about everything, yesterday. How do you feel? I am okay. Let's eat. Yes Seo Jung. You are not coming today? What? Why are you not coming today? What is it? Fever? You've never not come because of a fever before. Yes, you are right. But my fever being 40 degrees. 40? How about all the appointments? Wow, she must've peed. Gross. What about it? Couldn't you ask Tae Yang to go instead? I will get all better by tomorrow. Yes. Oh, you don't have to come to the hospital. I will be able to fight it by myself. I am truly sorry. No. You can't. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Hey. You are very naive. Eh? Even a fool could've seen through that lie. Don't worry. If things don't work out, you can work with me. Really? What is it that you do? I didn't tell you yet? Architect, Kang Tae Pung of Kang Tae Pung Construction Do you know? No, I don't. I'm sorry. I think I've heard of the name before. My name is Wang Seo Jung. I heard it before. The beautiful name. Because you are an architect, that is why your house is amazing. This is just a borrowed place. Since I work in both Busan and Seoul, I have two places and am going back and forth between them. Honestly, I am not interested in my own place. Why not? Because my thoughts keep on changing. If I have my own place, then in one year I would have to remodel it 12 times or more. It is better to not have one. Oh, it is like that. In the bedroom, there is a trophy. I saw it. That is a restaurant I built last year. Do you wanna go there to eat lunch? Go over there? You don't want to? No. Sorry to take a detour I don't mind we should buy you a change of clothes panties panties? you need to change your panties women don't leave home\without a fresh pair of panties that's true, you know a lot We'll take care of your old car.

It looks like the ocean and restaurant are one. Yes. Do you know him? Yes, my deceased sister's lover. Deceased sister? That architect Kang Tae Pung? Yes. Oh my. Who is he with? Why is she so ugly? Wow, did you really designed this place? Yes. This is where I always sit. VIP spot? This is not the most popular spot for customers. But it's my personal favourite. Why? Because it is comfortable. Although the view is important, architecture is not just decoration. It has to be functional and comfortable too. I see. Actually the most popular spot is over there. Do you know her? No. What kind of food do you like? I like all kinds of food. Over here, the steak is delicious. Hello. I heard from Eun Suk oppa about your accident. Are you okay? Do I know you? I am Eun Bin. - Oppa, why are you like that? - Eun Bin? What happened to you? Have you had a hard time recently? As if. Over here is my goddess, Wang Seo Jung. Hello, pleased to meet you. I am Kim Eun Bin. A stewardess at Korean Air. Pleased to meet you. Fortunately, you are doing well. Are you off work today? Yes. Introduce me to him. Me too. They are stewardesses, Min Gi and Yoon Ah. Then have fun. Excuse me. Wow, she is really ugly. But Eun Bin, wasn't your sister really beautiful? She really was. They really are pretty. Pretty? They don't even come close to you. The standards for a female stewardess have really fallen. If fallen is that much... You are not eating. When your heart is full, so is your stomach. Me too. In reality, I eat a lot more. That's good. Really good. Buying you dinner seems like it worked out. Oh, I am really full. Could we not take that with us? Excuse me? It's a waste to just throw it away. Oh, it must not be that kind of restaurant. Pretend you didn't hear me. Why not try? There is no harm in asking. Thank you Tae Pung. Later, when you are hungry, eat it then. I... don't wanna be alone yet. You can see the view of the harbor in three dimensions, can't you? Yes. Yes. It is an amazing saying even though I don't understand what it means. I can say funny things too. Do you know why the American President Obama won? I don't know. Because McCain* is a person whose path is blocked. *McCain sounds like Korean word "blocked" Your smiling face is beautiful. I can make other people smile, but this is the first time others made me laugh. Then this time, try to make me laugh. If you make a demand suddenly like that... Odori, the female dog who seduces the male dog. A sleeping hippo. Sorry, my jokes were stupid. No, I was just so touched I couldn't laugh. To be so beautiful and yet also so funny. Searching the whole world, I could never find a person like you. But, I am not beautiful in the least. Teacher Kang. Call me Tae Pung, Seo Jung. You are lovely. Stop it. I know... I know that I am ugly. I get hurt too. Seo Jung. I like you. You are lovable. Leaving a beauty like you all alone, you must be a present from God to me. I can't believe it. I can't either. I want to treasure this. This is something I made. I will buy it. No, when I go to work tomorrow, I will mail it to you. Isn't it better if you sell a lot of it? You can't park here. Hello. Hey, your change. To my room, quick!! This way! Are you okay? Even your ears are cute. People say they are too small. I'll make you happy. Stay by my side forever. Forever? The only thing I need is you. Me too I love you. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I didn't want to wake you, yesterday was fantastic, But I must go back to work today. Sorry for just going through your refrigerator. Thank you for the new clothes. [Kang Tae Pung] 154,000 related links. Julia we hit the jackpot. He is real. Look at this. After graduating from graduate school, got a job in America working for HOK. When he was a team leader his path seemed dark but because his parents were hospitalized in Korea he came back here to work. He worked for a small company doing small jobs. So in the beginning it was really hard for him. He couldn't even think about working internationally. I will make you happy. Stay with me forever. How was your weekend, sir? You brought the schedule? When this is over, let's talk. How about tomorrow? Thank you for everything. In a little bit, this is going to stop. Even your ears are adorable. What are you doing? Wang Seo Jung, pay attention. Hello. Hey, I thought you were sick. I, might get married. You? This person. Isn't that the architect Kang Tae Pung? So, you know him? Of course. He said he wanted to be with me forever. Kang... Kang Tae Pung said that to you? Yes. He said he was going to make me happy. It doesn't make sense. Tae Pung is not only an amazing engineer, but he is also a warm person. And tells amazing stories. But more than anything else, he is handsome. Maybe it's because I am so ugly, but I only see handsome men as men. I wanna have a son who looks exactly like Tae Pung. I never thought I could bear a human son. Yesterday, you never said anything about Tae Pung. Life changes in a blink of an eye. My preference for beautiful men has never changed. Hello. Hello. Sorry about yesterday. Your complexion is just as bright as always. In fact, just a little too bright. I got better by doing a lot of work. I hate living with a lying employee. Because you weren't here yesterday, Tae Yang couldn't go to China for a cute tiger shoot. Tae Yang is still busy doing your work from yesterday. So you are going to go to China. Yes. Depart immediately. Air plane ticket. Right now? You will have time to go get your passport. This is too much. I can't see him for 4 days. What are you doing? Hurry up. It seems like it is time to split up. I've found someone I like. You will forgive me, right? But Soo Mi, she looks exactly like you. 4 days? Yes. I wanna quit my work. Then come to me right now. I wanna do that too. But I should finish my work and do what needs to be done. Because there are only 3 people at our job. You are amazing. I like that about you. Everything... is perfect about you, my goddess. Perfect goddess. That is beautiful. Michael, how many times did I tell you? That the beauty of a great building is based on sincerity and comfort. If you are just going to waste money on useless adornments, just simplify this part and return the money to the client. Jang Ho Sub, don't worry about attending the next conference. Just go to the next project. Pick out a few simple details. Get up. Get up. Good. Over here. Okay. That's it. Stay right there. Do you want to do that shot again? Yes, do you want to do that shot again? If it runs off, I can't do anything about it. Okay. Come here. Ah, pretty. Good Shot. Good Shot. Hello. Fancy seeing you both yesterday and today. This is a surprise. I met her at the hospital. You said that I looked weird and so I went to the hospital for a checkup. To see if I was sick or anything. You look okay today. Your face is completely different from the day before. Very pretty. The girl I saw you with the other day, she isn't here? She went on a business trip. When she comes back, I am thinking about marrying her. You are going to go visit Unni's grave first, right? Of course. Eun Bin. Oh. Hello. Who are they? You met them yesterday. Did I? You probably only saw your date. We're not that noticeable. Then... Hey. Do you know that Eun Bin likes you? Don't say things like that. It is for real. But is the Angel that is on a trip to China more beautiful than them? She is a girl you won't be able to see anywhere else. And she looks like her. Like who? Soo Yeon. Do you have a picture? That's weird. Did it get erased? This girl? Did it disappear? Is it not this girl? Give it to me. Then where did she go? Mom, there's this guy named Kang Tae Pung. An amazing engineer and we might get married. You don't know Kang Tae Pung? In Korea, he is a very popular engineer. How could you not know him? Embarrassing. Are you bluffing right now? Bluffing? I am going to bring him home. You can see if I am bluffing or not. Yeah. When I call, just clean the house well. I am telling you the truth. The appearance is just the shell of the body. The things on the inside, organs, bones, muscles, veins these have to be working well and normally, that's what makes a beautiful human being. You said so yourself, that in engineering, appearance isn't everything. To have a good supporting base is a true building. So I'm saying, a woman is like a house; She'll naturally appear more beautiful as you live with her. "Ahh, she's beautiful but has these flaws" As you live life with a beauty, you start to pick at her faults, but with an ugly person, you start to find the positive aspects of her character. So you say, "Wow, this is great, I didn't know she had this beautiful side to her." So what I'm saying is that a woman is like a house, she'll prosper and flourish with love. Just like your buildings. There are women who are pretty and perfect. Just like my Angel. When is your angel getting here? In two days. I wanna see her. After two days, you are going to understand what I am saying. Man, what should I do about him? I am back. I missed you. Let's meet at Time Cafe. In such a rush. I'm sorry. After you've finished the presentation designs, send them to me by cell. Work hard. Yes? I'm sorry Seo Jung, the meeting ended late. Have you waited a long time? It's okay. I waited for 3 days already. Your voice is artistic. Do you know that your voice is angelic? I will be right in. I wanna see you. Yes? Seo Jung? Yes? Where are you right now? Where are you waiting for me right now? I am inside waiting for you. At Time Cafe? Yes. That is weird, the only woman I saw was some unattractive woman by the window. What was she wearing? An outdated poop-colored trench coat. You are very funny. I didn't have anything to laugh about for three days. You are the best. That voice is Seo Jung. Where are you? Did you go to the bathroom? I will be right in. I wanna see you. Me too. Excuse me, is there another Time Cafe? No, sir. Female guests, is it just the ugly one? Are you really going to be like this? What did you say just now? Ugly? Ex... excuse me. Stop now. You're going to the extreme. I am sorry for saying you were ugly earlier. But who are you? What's going on? Please leave a message after the beep Was I just dumped? I've returned! We're really grateful. I took a lot of great pictures. I'll write the article right away. That's great. How are you feeling? Feeling? Oh, I've completely recovered. I told the editor all about Kang Tae Pung. If it's true, that's big news, truly newsworthy. If you get interviewed, don't forget to mention you work for the Animal Club Magazine, Animal Plus. We'd get so much publicity. About that... It's over. What? We broke up. What? Why so suddenly? Things just change overnight. Isn't that life? Wouldn't you agree? One shot! One shot! One shot! I don't get anything right. I know, I know... I'll show you what happens when you break a girl's heart, I'll show you. So then, what can you do about it? I'll start thinking about that, right now. Something very terrible... World renowned architect, my ass. I'll get my revenge. Revenge? Stop right there, revenge is not dignified. But you've got to understand. He called me hideous, beastly. That kind of bastard has to pay. If it was just for fun, he could have ended it cleanly. He complimented me as if I was an angel, only to call me hideous. Are you sure it wasn't something you did? Me? When someone gets dumped, there's sure to be something wrong with the one who's been dumped. So, are you saying this is my fault? Then whose fault would it be? Mine? You're the one responsible for all the things that have happened in your life. But he was too much, he called me a goddess. A goddess? That he wanted to be with me forever... Whispered right into this ear. Hey, is that someone you know? What? About that... If this woman is Tae Pung's goddess, then... I definitely, most certainly, can't let this go. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, Hammurabi's Code of Law. Over here! There, right in front of you! You! There! There! You! Get out here! I said you, get out here! Just tell me this one thing. Why did you sleep with me? Me? With you? Yes, you, Kang Tae Pung. Are you always this manipulative when it comes to seducing women? I seduced you? But who are you? Who am I? These are the breasts you said you wanted to rest your face upon, the girl you told small is okay, I am that small breasted girl! I think that would be a hard feat to accomplish by any man. With breasts as flat as yours... You were quite happy to finally meet the goddess of your dreams. It was me, your dream goddess, who you fed water to on your sofa. I did help a girl, who collapsed on the street, but that wasn't you. I don't know you. Listen, everybody, for this low, filthy man to be Korea's best architect, we truly should be disheartened. To call this despicable playboy number one in anything! He even nibbled on this year, saying how cute it was! Who do you think you are?! Saying those things?! Call the police. Go ahead, call the police. If anyone is going to be arrested, it'll be you, Mr. Kang Tae Pung. Are you by any chance a friend of Seoo Jung? Not a friend, I am Wang Seo Jung. Should I show you some ID? Sir, should I call 119? Yes, call them right away! I did give water to a sick Seo Jung. I even told her that I liked small. But that isn't you. The person I know is another Wang Seo Jung. Until you tell me why you did this, - I won't stop coming back. - Miss, please come with me. And stop disturbing these good people here. I've dealt with all kinds from the animal kingdom, a measly human doesn't scare me! Sir, let me go! People work here You need to leave!! You know how I feel. My love You are the goddess of my dreams come back to me at last. I know I'm ugly, I know that much is true. I have feelings you know, I get hurt. I love you. I don't know who you are. This is the goddess then. That's her, Tae Pung said she was his goddess. I told you, this is not her. You were still experiencing the effects of the car crash. That's why you thought Wang Seo Jung was the most beautiful woman in the world. This woman must have been beautiful in other ways. Tae Pung is not the kind of guy to just fall for a pretty face. If we go by face alone, I might be prettier but... Tae Pung doesn't like me, does he? What are you talking about? Eun Bin, by chance, do you like me? I'm sorry. My deceased sister... Did you know she had plastic surgery? If you had met her before the surgery, would you not have loved her? What did you like about her, Tae Pung? Her face? Stop it. Let's not talk about the deceased. Tell me. What did you like about her? What was it? Let's stop doing this. I guess you don't have an answer. I'm a bit disappointed. Eun Bin, Eun Bin, I want to ask you something too. If you think Tae Pung is such a bad guy, why do you like him so much? What do you like about him so much? Is it the face? No. Attractive or not, Wang Seo Jung is Wang Seo Jung, and Kang Tae Pung is Kang Tae Pung. Let's go. You might have some problems with your sight. A beautiful girl can appear to be ugly? And an ugly girl can appear to be beautiful. (?) Will you look at this? How can I help you? I'm looking for Wang Seo Jung. Kang Tae Pung? The person who said would take the cat is taking another one. I've come to apologize. Here's the medical certificate. I sincerely apologize. Temporary impairment of vision? I thought about calling or texting you, but I didn't think you would answer my calls or read my texts. So I came personally. So? did you think I was beautiful then? Yes. And now? Now? Am I ugly to you? To be honest... You are. I told you, you shouldn't smoke. It's only one. It's because I love you that I worry about your health. It's only one. It's cold outside. Is it okay if I smoke? I like it, when a man smokes. I'm beginning to like you more and more. Wow, wow, wow! This is so fun! This is the best! I'm sorry. You're angry, aren't you? What is this? Really? So you read this kind of stuff? You're such a girl. I was thinking about raising a cat. You can't. I have a cat allergy. I get a rash. You have a garlic allergy too, don't you? Yeah, if I peel garlic my hands get itchy. You're really finicky, aren't you? And you can't cook, can you? But you still like me, right? I like you. Odori, the female dog who seduces the male dog. A baby snake, Leonardo How many times do I have to tell you? Architecture that only considers outer appearances is worthless. Yes, Sir. Architecture for the people. Architecture that shapes people; Think about it. I understand. Good morning. Good morning. Architect... Kang Tae Pung. This is the floor for the executive officers. This is really quite splendid. It feels as if one owns all of Korea. The view is not the most important part of this floor. More important is how open the officers are to the other employees. The employees must feel that this is an open environment. I believe that a company with such characteristics will be destined to greatness. Open leadership you say, sounds grand. Michael... Yes, isn't he cute? You can go ahead. Poor little kitty. But we can't keep them. Then should I see if I can find someone through the magazine? Really? That sounds great. Come on, you're coming with me. Goodbye. Hey, Kang Tae Pung, you cat thief! You lady killer... Even cats, if they're female, you'll... It's a male cat. Where are you looking? You're disgusting. What are you doing here? I'll see you again. He's a bad man. If you're not careful, you'll get hurt. Take care, darling. At least, he said goodbye. Goodbye, you playboy. - Mom. - Oh goodness. I must have dozed off. If you're coming to visit, you should have called first. You don't ever call so I came to hear about that famous architect of yours. But when I came, all I found were three kittens. I'm trying to find homes for them right now. You should take one with you. We already have three cats that you gave us at home. Oh yeah, I forgot. And your house, what is this?! It's a total dump, full of garbage. When you marry Kang Tae Pung, make sure to take all your cats. Mom, you should go home. Why? Did he cheat on you? We decided to go back to the way things were. I knew something like this would happen. But why? Even if I married him, I knew I would never be happy with him. I knew it would turn out like this, so I brought something for you. What is it? To help you forget Kang Tae Pung, why don't you go on a blind date? Ugh! What is this ugly mug? - What an eye sore. - You stupid girl! He's a elementary school teacher, and they said he's very likeable. Your dad is already won over. I object. He's so ugly. He's not famous or amazingly good-looking, but he looks like he could sincerely care for you. Mom, so this is what you think I'm fit for? To be honest, I think this guy is more in your league than your famous architect. Yeah, he was a bit out of my league. But this guy's face is really hideous. Even if he is unattractive, you shouldn't talk about others like that. But Mom, a man has to be beautiful. His legs, his neck, his arms... Head to toe, gorgeous. Tall nose, cute lips, eyes that go out like this, and a back that is wide and warm. You have too many expectations. You're stuck in some manhwa romantic fantasy. I can't marry if I don't have a dream. This kind of crazy girl, who's ever going to take you off my hands? And what is with your teeth? Fix your teeth at least. So, Seo Jung, what are your hobbies? Looking at architecture. When I look at beautiful buildings, I feel the wisdom of humans. And what about you? Even during holidays, I think of my students. Here. You must be a good teacher. The view is really fabulous. Me gusta mucho I mentioned this earlier. The view of outer appearance of the boardroom isn't that important I understand your thinking. Architecture isn't about appearance That's right But you have to admit, the view from here is wonderful The lady from before gave him to me Isn't he cute? Back then, was I beautiful to you? This feels great! You get to come with me. And now, I'm ugly to you? At dusk, doesn't everything seem to be richer? Oh... What exactly is richer? The sun? All men are the same. You should give him another chance. I'd rather not. You're not beautiful, and look at this place, you've made it into a dump! If only people knew, they would stop calling you such a good girl. I just don't want to! Even the idea of him naked grosses me out! Really, is that all you think about? It's important, isn't it? Isn't that right? You know, that's not what marriage is really about. I'm telling you, after you get married, you begin to develop affection, love. I'm fine with living alone my whole life. No! I absolutely will not allow it. Why not? You don't seem to be all that happy to me, Mom. Happiness? You can't waste your life looking for something that vague. Yes, raising a child is hard, and although not always happy, it is still a big achievement. I don't want to have a child with this guy! How did you become so stubborn! Oh! Laundry! Have you taken it in yet? I was so busy cleaning, you think I had time to do the laundry?! Oh, it's cold. So beautiful. Kang Tae Pung... Seo Jung! What are you doing down there? I wanted to see you. My lovely pitbull, my sweetly sleeping hippo. Have you relapsed? Yes, I must have relapsed when you hit me. What? So you think I'll take you back? It doesn't matter. What? Your looks. I... like you. Don't play games. When your eyes get better, you'll be as horrible as before. Be it beautiful Seo Jung, or ugly Seo Jung... I like you! I don't like you. I hate you. Hate you, hate you, hate you! What's all the commotion? Hate you! Goodness. Why are you closing your eyes? So you won't see the ugly me? So it is you, Wang Seo Jung. It's true. When it comes to a man, it's the face that counts. What do you like about me? Everything. No, really. I like that you're fun. And? Brave... And? Scary when you're mad... And? Is that it? Fearless... And? That you have small fingernails... And? Cute... Even though I'm not beautiful, I'm cute? Beautiful or not, you're still cute. Even if you return to normal, will I be cute? I like you just the way you are, right now. And what else? What else? That you don't get on my case about smoking. And? Kang Tae Pung will be married today, in the church that he designed himself. In God's name, we pray that they will be forever happily wedded. Really? You're too beautiful today! - Blessed, you've been blessed. - Excuse me, Excuse me, Sorry to intrude, but there's someone you have to say hi to. Congratulations. Thank you. Then, come over quickly after you've talked. I heard from Tae Pung, that you visited Sister's grave. Thanks for doing that. Grave? What do you mean by grave? So you didn't hear from Tae Pung? I'm sorry. Please tell me. It's been quite awhile, but my sister and Tae Pung were engaged. My sister died her fourth year of college in a car accident. But Tae Pung loved my sister so much, he never had a lasting relationship. Until he met you. My sister is probably happy for you as well. So, Tae Pung said we went to visit her grave together? Don't worry about it too much, he probably just said it to be considerate. What was your sister like? If I am to use Tae Pung's words... She was fun, cute, a little moody, scary when angry, and he liked that she was fearless. I'm sorry. If I made you feel bad, please forgive me. My sister is long gone, and Tae Pung truly loves you. Seo Jung, what are you doing? Everybody's waiting for you, let's go. Seo Jung, meet our new employee. What do you like about me? What? Tell me, what do you like about me? That you're fun, cute and scary when you're angry. And because I'm fearless? Yeah, you're right. That's exactly what you said about your last love, Kim Soo Yeon. What? I might not be beautiful, but you said you liked other things about me. Why are you being like this? So was I a replacement? I don't like that. I don't want to be that. I'm me. I can't be a replacement for your old love. Why don't you just go hold Soo Yeon's tombstone while you sleep! Seo Jung! Seo Jung, why are you being like this? Make me your wife. Seo Jung won't return. I can deal with anything, as long as it means being your wife. I can be my sister's replacement, Seo Jung's replacement. I just want to be near you. I'm being serious. I won't be marrying anyone anymore. Please, I promise I'll be a great wife. You should value yourself more. I'll take you home. Or, if you can go by yourself, do so. Do you still love her? Seo Jung? You should start thinking about your future. Because I will not be revisiting the past. [1 year later] I feel great. You too, right? The wind feels so refreshing. Why do we always drive this way? I don't quite understand it either, why I always drive this way. What! Don't tell me you peed on the seat again. I keep telling you can't use the car as your bathroom, you never listen! Are you alright, Miss? Yes, I think I'm alright. Your car looks fine, but would you like me to call the ambulance? I'm not injured, so don't worry yourself about it. Alright, then be careful on your way. Wow, he was so handsome. Because this is the person Eun Suk chose to marry. It is without a doubt Miss Lee Han Na is an amazing woman. I am very proud to call Eun Suk and Han Na my friends. Compared to him, I am immature. Even as I would arrogantly say that architecture is not about the outside, but the balance of all the elements, I myself, did not truly know the people my designs were for. I was so obsessed with outer appearances, that I lost someone very special to me. I understand my mistake now, but my realization was too late... I lost someone I loved. I'm very sorry, everyone. I have gone off topic. You still have time! Go quickly. Go! I'm very sorry, everyone. I will finish my congratulations here. I wish you happiness! Congratulations! Goodness! What's happened to your face! Seo Jung! It's me, Kang Tae Pung. Is it really you? Do you still love me? Always. What do you like about me? Everything. Tell me. You're fun... And? Brave... And? Scary when you're angry... And? Cute... Even if I'm not beautiful, I'm cute? Always. You're not my Tae Pung! I was in an accident just now, I must also be suffering from that temporary visual impairment. What do I look like to you? A complete pig! With a face four times as large! But I am Kang Tae Pung. If you're in love, appearances shouldn't matter. This past year that we were separated, I realized that you were my destiny. I want to hear that from the handsome Kang Tae Pung. You still love Kang Tae Pung, don't you? Yes. Then... Close your eyes. Do you feel my presence? Yes. I'm by your side. So am I a replacement for your lost love? No, just stay like this. With your love for me, take me as I am, right now. You can do that, right? Now, open your eyes. Ah! My eyes are back to normal! I still like this better than the ugly you. It's true, when it comes to a man, it's his face. So you haven't changed. Even though, I have. I like the beautiful Kang Tae Pung. Even though I like Kang Tae Pung for being Kang Tae Pung. It's just... I love Kang Tae Pung! [2 years earlier] That's right, Ellie. Just like that. Stay still for a second. That's it, Ellie, stay just like that! I have a meeting today, and I have to finish this article before then, so please, let's do this quickly. You got it? Ellie? Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! You can't run off like that! I told you to stay right next to me, didn't I? You could have caused an accident! Wow, she's really beautiful. I would like to be as beautiful as her. I have to be a little prettier to really have a hot romance. Ouch! Isn't that right, Ellie? Is this 911? There's an accident here. Yes, a car accident, a car accident. Where? Where is here? Here? This is some bridge...
