♪ Andalasia ♪ ♪ Andalasia ♪ ♪ That happily-ever-after place ♪ ♪ Always remember Andalasia ♪ ♪ And a smile will always be Upon your face ♪ Bonjour. Once upon a time in a magical kingdom called Andalasia, a baby was found in the forest. With no mother or father to speak of, the baby was raised by the animals, who loved her as one of their own. And her name was Giselle. Giselle grew into a beautiful young lady… With a loving heart and a secret desire. ♪ I've been dreaming of A true love's kiss ♪ ♪ And a prince I'm hoping comes with this ♪ Until one day, she won the love of Andalasia's bravest prince! But then, Giselle was pushed through a portal by an Evil Queen and landed in a strange and extremely confusing kingdom called… ♪ New York City New York City ♪ There she met Robert, who was a lawyer with dreamy eyes and a daughter named Morgan, who saw magic everywhere she went. So Giselle and Robert fell in love. And they lived… ♪ Ever, ever after ♪ Dad. Dad! - Come on! Read it again, Dad. - Get over here! What if I told you that "ever after" wasn't the end of their story? Oh! We've heard this story a million times. That's how it always ends. Uh, uh, uh. You only heard part of the story. See, it turns out, New York wasn't Giselle's happily-ever-after after all. - Huh? - What? Huh? Well, I'm not too proud of my part in this one, but if you two will get into bed, I'll read it to ya. This story begins where the old one left off: in the kingdom of New York after "happily ever after." After? But there is no after, after "happily ever after." Yeah. You just get married then nothing ever happens to you again. Oh, not in this world. Over there, things would never stop happening. For Giselle, a few years went by. Morgan sprouted up, and eventually, Robert and Giselle had a baby. A beautiful girl named Sofia. And for one moment, Giselle truly had it all. And that's when things began to change. First, with all the baby stuff, their castle in the sky shrunk two sizes. Then, life got so busy, it felt like a sleeping curse fell over them every single night. But the hardest part of all was Morgan. She became what that world calls a "teenager." And it felt to Giselle that she had set out to a faraway place where she could never go. With so much change, Giselle started feeling that life in the kingdom of New York wasn't such a fairy tale after all. And that's when she saw… a sign. And, suddenly, she realized their happily-ever-after might be somewhere else. So, Giselle and Robert began their quest for a new happily-ever-after. "Monroeville." Where the hell's Monroeville? I don't know. It's got to be better than here. I know that change can be scary, but it can also be exciting. Think of all of the wonderful new people you're going to meet who will love you just as much as I do. And remember, whenever you need a friend, what do we do? Morgan, can you try and help out here? I am helping. I'm literally telling the entire Internet about my kidnapping. Everyone agrees it's a tragedy. You know, a lot of people move to the suburbs from the city, and they're wildly happy. Yeah, well, I was wildly happy here. Can you back me up on this, Sofia? You are no help. So, who's excited for our new adventure? Very excited. - Oh, that's… sarcasm. - Sarcasm, yeah. But, Morgan, I promise, Monroeville is the perfect place. Perfect for you, maybe. Not so much for me. - Morgan... - Ah, ah, ah. No speeches. If we're gonna do this, let's just go. Teenagers are like this. She'll be fine. I hope so. We really did have magic memories here, didn't we? We did. And we'll have more. Trust me, if I learned anything from meeting a princess on a billboard, it's that sometimes you just have to take a leap. Hmm. Let's start our new life. And so they packed up and moved… ♪ To a place where there ain't nothin' To perturb ya ♪ ♪ Or disturb ya ♪ ♪ A new and magic kingdom ♪ ♪ Called suburbia ♪ Isn't it wonderful? It's the closest thing to Andalasia I've ever seen. Our house is like a castle. I'll have my own room. You've told me a million times. Hey, look. Mm-hmm. Well, you never know, Morgan. Maybe Monroeville will give you a little magic like I had growing up. Hmm. Here it is. Oh, good. The walls are back up. The walls were down? - Oh. - Oh, boy. Wow. Interesting castle. We're running a little behind schedule, so you just have to have vision. A new baby in town. - We would've brought gifts. - Oh. We're great with naps, if you ever need help. Oh, my. Thank you. - I might take you up on that. - Mmm. - Oh, should we go check out our new home? - Yeah. It's all part of the adventure. Bye. That goes in the living room. Thanks. Yeah, that's not an adventure. That's a landfill. A land filled with adventure. Here, let me take my little princess and show you the rest of the house. Yes. It's okay. Off we go. I am going to go see if one of those movers will move me back to New York. I know it's hard to start over someplace new. I did it once. Not really on purpose, but I found that you just have to look at things the right way. Oh, no. Here, I'll show you.

Ready? Okay. - Okay. - Open them. - Oh, wow. - Mmm. This is… wow. Wow. I know I got carried away, and you can change anything. I just wanted you to have a real room when you got here. Yeah. She made them promise that it would be done. It's beautiful, Mom. Really? Oh, pretty soon, this whole place will feel like home. You'll see. You'll see. - Uh, yeah. - Yeah. - Good job, honey. Good job. Good job. - Mmm. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Oh, my... - Shut it off! - That's my stuff! Oh, help! - Smother the flame! - What... - Grab a blanket! - Put it out. - Careful! - Oh! - I can't... Those were all of my clothes! Hello, hello! Do we know somebody? No. But we can. What are you? Color-blind? That's not green. That's aqua. What are they? Fish? - Oh. - Oh. Hope you don't mind. Door was open. - Giselle and Robert, right? And Morgan. - Oh. Yeah. Oh, and little Sofia. - Why, yes. How did you know? - Hi. Malvina Monroe. - Oh. - I would've sold you this house, but I deal in slightly more upscale homes, so… Mm-hmm. - Rosaleen and Ruby! - Oh! Oh, they smell so good. - Oh. - Oh! Wow. - Giselle. - It's really something. She made it all herself. Even the baskets. Really? I weave. Well, that's very nice of you. And a little weird. Morgan, why don't we take these into the kitchen? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. - We'll just get right... Bye now. I have one that age too. - So pouty. - Oh. But he's still the apple of my eye. Of everyone's eye. More like the apple of everybody's whole face. Oh... Now, if you all need anything, I'm your gal, all right? - Oh. Mm-hmm. - I know this town better than anyone else. So modest. She made this town what it is. Oh, yeah. She's like a queen around here. Oh. Well, then I'm doubly honored. I think that every town should have a queen, so… Yeah. Good night. Well, that wasn't exactly the first day we'd hoped for, but… Maybe we should've waited another month. No, we pushed it three times. Don't worry. We'll settle in. Listen to that. That is so much better than 5th Avenue. Mmm, no, that's just weirdly louder. Those crickets composed that song just for us to say, "Hello." As a thank-you, we should build 'em a resort. I don't think they have one of those. Can we just talk about the fact that we moved out here to get more space, and now we're just sleeping in the same room? - I know. - Morgan, we talked about this. It's just until the smoke clears your room. Yeah. ♪ Here we are A family starting over ♪ Mom. Okay. Hmm? Why is your alarm going off? It's still yesterday outside. I'm a commuter now. Oh, where's the fire? Oh, it's okay, baby. It's okay, sweetheart. Fire! Oh. Oh, no! Oh... Oh, yes. It is a lovely morning, isn't it? - Um… Oh! - Ow! We gotta move these boxes. I'm so late. I can't figure out this commuting thing. Coffee, thank you so much. I'm gonna get some cream for that. - Oh, my God. What is that smell? - Oh! Good morning. I made you some, um… - …toast. - Toast? Yeah. Well, it's a miracle. One of my shirts survived. - Oh! I am so sorry! Are you okay? - Oh, no! - Oh, my goodness! - Oh, my God! The... - I'm fine. - Did you get burnt? No, but this is my only outfit! So sorry. Oh, the king and queen of Andalasia? Nancy! Edward! What are you doing here? Oh, well, we had to build a portal to your new home. - A girl! - Hi. - Oh, hi! - Hey. Hey, wow. Ah? ♪ Robert! ♪ Congratulations on the increasing size of your progeny. - Ah. - Thank you. Thank you. Uh… …your dwelling. Uh, are you poor now? - Edward! - No, we're not poor. Oh, it's what they call a fixer-upper. - Yeah, it's... We're... - Ah, I see, a fixer-upper! Yes. Once your peasants have dug out the moat and added a turret, and a balcony from which you can sing, bathed in the light of a forgiving moon… I see it now. Okay. And on that note, I'm off. - Oh, no. - Bye. - Well, let me show you the house. - Okay. Robert! Uh, it appears you've forgotten your sword. Oh, no. I don't have a sword. Oh, I just assumed that, now that you are a country squire, - you'd have more need of a sword. - No, still a lawyer. Ah, tragic. How desperate you must be to truly do something. - I do a lot. - Yes, of course. A brave front is required to face a life as barren as this. Perhaps this will help. - It's yours. - Oh, no! No, I couldn't. Oh, no! You must. Robert, this sword and I have slayed many a beast. And seen magnificent adventures, testing both body and spirit! May it do the same for you. Thank you. I wish you well. Hmm? Ah! Thank you, peasant. Hmm. We missed her birthday last month. But we just had to make sure that the goddaughter of the king and queen of Andalasia got one of these.

You're a true daughter of Andalasia. Hmm? Okay, well, uh, if you don't have a wand for a fake daughter of Andalasia, - I'm gonna go change. - Oh... And yes, I will look in your closet. I'm sure there are lots of fun options in there for making a real splash at my new school. Yes. She sometimes says one thing and means the opposite. - Huh? - I can never tell. It's... Yeah. Yeah, well, that's teenagers for you. Are you okay? - Oh, yes. It's fine. - Hmm… I just... Hmm? Is it sometimes easier to live in Andalasia? Oh. Well, I wouldn't say easier. We have dragons and ogre rebellions. See, in Andalasia the hardest part of life is finding your happily-ever-after. - Everything else seems easy. - Mm-hmm. This world is... feels very different. Yeah. It's true. Happily ever after is more of a concept here than it is a thing. Really? How horribly bleak. Well, I say, that if this world is not to your liking, then you must change it. Well, honey, it's not always that easy. Hogwashery! If anyone can make something out of this, why, it's our Giselle. Made it. Is that a sword? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Hmm. You should tell 'em, "no bag, double wrapped." And maybe leave the sword at home next time. Don't listen to him. You gotta do you. After all, you're riding this train over and over. And over and over. And over and over. And over and over. And then you die. It's just reality, man. Metro North to Grand Central Station. Next stop, Poughkeepsie. Oh, I gotta go in! Save me a seat! I feel like a human get-well bouquet. Don't be silly. You look beautiful. The flowers on your skirt bring out the rest of the flowers on your skirt. Oh, great. - Oh, my. - Very nice! This is a big improvement from last year. She really is involved. - Congrats, you made it! - Thank you. Wow. You really do have a talent for baked goods. - It's just a little fundraiser. - For, um, Monroe-fest? What's that? It's the biggest event of the year. Malvina organizes the whole thing. - It's spectacular. - Mmm? There's also games and a little fun vote for prince and princess. Her son Tyson's won prince three years in a row. Even when he broke both his legs, he still won. - It's not rigged. I promise. - Mm-mmm. I think it sounds wonderful. I love festivals. We have them all the time where I come from. - Mmm. - Ah! They were usually interrupted by evil forces of some kind, but when they weren't, it really brought people together. - Aha. - I would love to help if you need it. You actually should take her up on that. This one time she made a forest entirely out of M&M's and had it delivered to my class by pigeon. - That's right. - Yeah. No one beats her at this kind of stuff. Huh? Is that so? Well, here we go. Morgan? You're gonna be great. Thank you. - Hmm. - Tee-hee-hee. ♪ Just believe in yourself! ♪ What? Wait. What was that? You know, Giselle, if you have time, I'd love to buy you a coffee - and hear more about your M&M masterpiece… - Oh. …and whatever else there is to know about our newest Monrovians. That would be so nice. Thank you. Hey. - Excuse you! - I'm living the full cliché here. They must have an urgent selfie to post. Hmm. Hey, you're the new girl from New York. Uh, Morgan. And you're Tyson from cupcakes. Ah, you met my mother. Yeah, I just try to ignore whatever she's doing. She gets kind of intense. Yeah, well, imagine if she was made of magic and sang at the drive-through. Huh. Yeah. Tyson! Come on! - Dipset, bro. - Let's go, man! - Ew. Look what she's wearing. - Whoa. - Whoa. That's a lot of flowers. - Like, a lot. Extra large cappuccino with five shots. - There it is. - Hmm. - Now, let me see… - Hmm? - Herbal tea… - Oh. Chamomile... No! Hibiscus. You're right. He's right. Oh, Edgar knows everything. He's my eyes and ears. Thank you. - Oh? - Wow, you guys move really quickly. - We go wherever she needs us to be. - Mm-hmm. As you can see, Giselle, our town is really just one big family. And like a family, everyone has their place in it. You know? And once you've found where you fit, Monroeville can be whatever you wish. You know, I think you're right. Oh, I'm so glad you like it. Do you think we should add music? Oh. Oh. Hi, Morgan. How did it go? It was fine. Does this mean it didn't go well? Well, no one talked to me all day, so I got a lot of me-time. That was nice. Oh. Yes, that was sarcasm. My day sucked. Well, this isn't anything a little glitter couldn't fix. It's old anyway. What's the point? The point is, is that it's a memory tree, and as we say in Andalasia... "Memories are the most powerful magic of all." I know. I'm not really sure it works the same way here. Morgan. I know you didn't want to come here. But if you give it a chance, it will get better. What if it doesn't? I should go back to school in New York. I can take the train with Dad. - It'll be fine. - It's only been a day. We just have to figure out where you fit in. We won't do anything, okay? If I'm gonna do this, then I have to do it myself, all right? Okay. I'm not a little girl anymore. - I got this. - Mm-hmm. Hmm? "Meet you at school. I have a wonderful idea." This cannot be good. And there you go. There you go. Vote for Morgan. She is new here. And she makes a great friend. - Who is Morgan? - I'm glad you like them. There you go. Vote for Morgan. What are you doing? Oh, well, I was just thinking, in Andalasia, we have festivals all the time, and everybody knows the prince and the princess. And now everyone will know you. Yes, but I told you that I could figure this out on my own. Why won't you let me do that? - Morgan. Morgan. - Oh. I'm sorry, Giselle, but you can't have a table on school property unless you're an official member of a committee. Oh, well, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Well, now you do. - Ladies. - Gladly. Excuse me. Oh, these cupcakes look incredible! - Oh. - Take it all down. All of it. She's never been this late without calling. I think she's turned off her phone. That's it. She's grounded. Do you remember when we made this? She used to beg me for stories from Andalasia every night, and her favorite ones were always about the Magical Memory Tree. She used to love those. I don't know what happened. Oh, nothing happened. Teenagers do this all the time. That's all it is. It's more than that. I never sing the right song anymore, and even when I make cupcakes, everything goes wrong. I used to be good at things. Things will get better. Just give it a second. Robert, are you happy here? We just got here. Hmm. When is the last time that you were truly happy? Uh, well… It's not that I'm unhappy. It just... Sometimes I wonder if... If time's just slipping away, and I'll be riding a train over and over and over again for the rest of my life. - Oh, Morgan. - What... Where have you been? - I went to New York. - By yourself? I've been riding the subway alone since I was 13. Let's calm down, please. Don't tell me to calm down. - What were you thinking? - I don't know, Dad. I was thinking, though, maybe you should have left me where I belong. You belong here. No, I don't! Look, I know that you want to live in some perfect fairy-tale land, but we don't. - Okay? We live here… - If you want to be mad, you be mad at me. - …In this stupid town, and I hate it! - But do not talk to your mother like that! My mother? Mm-hmm. She is not my mother. She's my stepmother. That's all she'll ever be. Stepmother? She didn't mean that. I think maybe she did. I can't change that.

Out doing some last-minute shopping for tonight, are we? What's tonight? Your Majesty. For the festival, milady. Oh, the festival. Is that still happening? Why wouldn't it? No power on Earth could stop it. It's my… little gift to my people. Oh. Of course, Your Majesty. That's an interesting trinket. Oh, um… Mmm. Why don't you just focus on your little party? After all, baked goods are what you do best, Your Majesty. That's wicked. The wickedest. Leaping lollipops, what was that? You know… …I was just realizing that this is her very first festival in Monrolasia, and we'll need to get you a new dress, and… - …well, we better get right on that. - Huh? See you tonight, Your Majesty. Something is going on with her. And I wanna know what. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Everyone, out. Out. Out. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the… most powerful of them all? Mirror? Nope. Mirror! Wha... Did you not hear the question? I did, Your Majesty. I just don't want to end up shattered on the floor, if I can help it. Just tell me who it is. But it's always you. Oh, well, he must not understand. We said most powerful, not the prettiest. I mean, this guy, huh? Apologies, Your Majesty. I just... I don't know what's happening. I do. It's that wand she's been so coy about. It's dripping with magic. Even a fool could see it. - You two, get it for me! - Hmm. But... Wait... You mean... You mean steal it? Uh, yes, Your Majesty. But... Ow, ow, ow, ow! Oh, Giselle. What have you done? Dresses certainly are different than when I was almost a princess. How do I look? Oh, Morgan. You look wonderful. What do you think? - It's beautiful. - Then we'll take it. You really don't have to do that. I'm sure it's very expensive. Of course, I do. I've always dreamed of sharing a night like this with you, and it's going to be perfect. Now we just need shoes. Hmm. So, Miss Giselle, we must find a dress for you too. Oh, no. Thank you. I'm fine. Nonsense! These are one of a kind: hand dipped in actual fairy dust. You will twinkle like a star. Oh, that is a very aggressive twinkle, but I really don't need... Hmm. Miss Giselle? Miss Giselle, is everything okay? You know, I was just thinking. I really do have a figure for fashion. The finest hourglass would shatter with envy. Oh. Let's try them all. Ooh. Oh. What is that smell? Oh, hey, it's me. You know why? I fell into a gutter! Oh! Geez, you buy the whole town? Well… …it's not all for me. Hmm. Is that so? Picture our Morgan, the belle of the ball… In this! Huh? Oh. Well… Well? Ooh. Okay. Over to the right. It looks… different in this light. It's definitely air-conditioned! Oh! What happened? It's torn to shreds. Why, it's hardly fit for a maid. Not exactly how I would've put it. What? It was a little judgy. - Well, perhaps I can mend it. - No. No mending. I got it. I'll just march right down there and demand an explanation. Okay, well, I'm off to market, and then I'll have plenty of time to get ready for the festival. Mm-hmm. - Oh! - Hmm? Thank you for everything, Stepmother. Stepmother? Oh, no. What? - What? - Oh! My hair, it's so high, and my dress is so low. And of course, I want that dress to be made of rags. People like me always do. People like who? What are you talking about? Oh, no, Pip. I'm afraid that my wish is turning me into a... A what? It's turning me into a… A what? A wicked stepmother. What? Come on! Oh, actually. Yeah. No. No, no, I can totally see it. Oh, no. Oh, Pip! Uh, hey, slow down! Where are we going? Who lives in this rat hole? Morgan does. Stepdaughters always live in attics or dungeons. Oh, Pip, do you know what this means? I am the villain of Monrolasia! Well, you're not the only villain. Well, that's silly. There can only ever be one villain. Not counting minions or pets. Or villains that you don't know are villains until it's too late. Well, Monrolasia might be different. 'Cause there's you, and then there's that evil queen you made. Who, Malvina? She's not evil. She's... Uh, did you see that outfit? With the big gestures and the crazy eyes! Oh, no. So, you better unwish that wish quick before she, uh... Pip? I don't feel so... What's wrong? Oh! Oh. Oh, Pip. Wicked stepmothers don't have cute chipmunks as friends. They have... Cats! And evil ones! Oh, I can't be an evil cat. They eat chipmunks! Oh, I'm gonna be sick! Surely there's an adventure out here somewhere. A bellow of distress. Finally! What are we to do? I'm not going in there. You go in. Well, I'm certainly not going in there. Are you a dragon slayer? I believe I am. Ooh. Never fear. I shall slay the beast. I wouldn't if I were you. It is very large. - Oh. - And cranky. Hmm. A very large and cranky dragon is just what I've been looking for. Won't be a moment. Onward, my sweetness. Have you done this before? Have... Of course, yes, I have... I have slain many a dragon. - Good on you. - Oh! Ow. Oh, oh. Hot. That's hot. I shall persevere. I shall conquer the craven beast! I shall... Hey! No offense, sir, but you might want to find another profession. Uh, what are you doing? Nancy said if we had any problems, all we had to do was ask. Welcome to your magical wishing wand experience! - If you should ever have a question… - Oh. …just ask, and I shall appear. - Hello! - Hey, we got no time for this. Good kitty. Good kitty. I'm sorry. My friend's a little anxious because we need to undo a wish as soon as possible. Oh. Didn't like what you got, huh? Well, I wished for a fairy-tale life, and it made my town a place like Andalasia. And now I'm slowly turning into a wicked stepmother. And I'm her soon-to-be-evil cat. Oh! Oh, you changed the world. What? You changed the world! Do you know how much magic it takes to make that happen? Whoo! Where do you think all that magic comes from, hmm? Andalasia, that's where. This is world-ending stuff. This is definitely a wish to be unwished. Good luck. Uh-oh! What we need to know is how to unwish the wish! Welcome to the magical... Whoa, it's you. Okay. See, we always build in a certain amount of time to reverse the wish. You know, in case you change your mind. Thank goodness you are not all villain yet. - Good. - Watch the tassels, please. So, how far along are we? Let's see. Stepmothers. Well, they're wicked. Wicked good. Mmm. Check on that one. The other three are, well, vain… I'm not vain. I just look good in everything. There it is. Okay. - Uh-oh. - Cruel and ambitious. Yes, I would say your clock has not run out yet. - Good. - What kinda clock do you mean? It could be anything. Have you seen a flower dropping petals? Huh? - No? - Mm-mmm. How about a clock counting down to midnight with an ominous-sounding chime? I mean, it's pretty on the nose, but it's a classic! You know, that's not a litter box. That's where I live. Not to worry, though. As long as you unwish it before midnight… …you'll be fine. What happens at midnight? On the last stroke of 12:00, the spell is set, and nothing will be as it was before. It means your wish is permanent. For all time, 'ime, 'ime, 'ime! I did that for effect. Permanent. To unwish your wish, all you have to do is use the wand, labeled "wand." - Where is it? - Yes, yes, yes. It's right... Uh… It's gone. Oh, no. Well, good luck with all of this. You need it. Oh. - Hurry! It's already... - Two o'clock. That means it's cruelty. No, no, no, no. We can't let this happen. We have to fight it. I'm not an evil cat. I'm not an evil cat. I'm not an evil cat. You stay here. I have to find a way to stop this. And I have to lick this, for some reason. Hmm. Ugh. Aw, yeah, that's real bad. It's all going to be okay. We just need some magic. As we say in Andalasia, "Magic fixes everything." Or breaks it? But then you find more magic to undo the magic, - and then everything's fine again. - Good day, madam. Oh. Well, at least we look fine. That is not important right now. Speak for yourself. But Robert will certainly appreciate it. If he isn't slain by something. Oh, no! She's right. I mean, I'm right. He thinks he's a prince. With a sword. Who knows what he'll find out there? Or Morgan. Although, nothing ever happens to young girls in Andalasia. They just sing and pick flowers and sometimes get trapped in a tower or a dungeon or get kidnapped by trolls. Or witches. Oh, my! Oh, that's nice. - Thank you. - Oh. That's… quite a frock. What is she wearing? Good morning, Morgan. You ready for the big festival tonight? Of course. Uh, my stepmother even bought me a new dress. She's never done that before. Everything's perfect. ♪ There's a festival in our future ♪ ♪ We're all giddy with anticipation ♪ ♪ I'll be hanging flowers On scented bowers ♪ ♪ To enhance the festivation ♪ ♪ There'll be merriment in the courtyard ♪ ♪ And waltzing even in the hallways ♪ ♪ Won't it just be perfect? ♪ ♪ Won't it just be perfect? ♪ ♪ Won't it just be perfect? ♪ ♪ Don't you think It will be just perfect? ♪ ♪ Of course ♪ ♪ Isn't it always? ♪ ♪ It's another Perfect Monrolasia morning ♪ ♪ Shiny children play Beneath a shiny sky ♪ ♪ Every bird in every tree Singing extra prettily ♪ ♪ It's all perfect So why aren't I? ♪ ♪ I know my role And every day, I play it ♪ ♪ Who I really am I never let them see ♪ ♪ But I'm feeling, deep inside ♪ ♪ Where the weird parts of me hide ♪ ♪ Maybe perfect isn't perfect For me ♪ ♪ In me There's hunger for adventure ♪ ♪ In me There's a longing for romance ♪ ♪ And secretly I crave A day that I could save ♪ ♪ I could do it If I ever get the chance ♪ ♪ And on this Perfect Monrolasia morning ♪ ♪ There's a little thrill Of possibility ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've got a feeling That maybe today ♪ ♪ Just around that corner Or out by the bay ♪ ♪ Some kind of change Could be coming my way ♪ ♪ Something wild and imperfect ♪ ♪ But perfectly right ♪ ♪ For me ♪ ♪ No, I never wanted To be perfect ♪ ♪ Just the chance to do and be ♪ ♪ What's right for me ♪ This fruit is very squishy today. Well, I would be careful then. The squishy dragon fruit can be a little bit… …grumpy. Sugar dates, figs and pistachios! Can I help you, love? Oh, yes. Do you have anything that can reverse magic that you didn't intend to use, perhaps a poultice? Or an unguent? Those can be very powerful. No unguents, no. This one makes your eyelashes curly. Um… Oh. Curly eyelashes? Why not? No! We don't have any time for vanity, we need to pull ourselves together. Um… So, I assume you'll be attending the ball this evening? Yes, I am. I'm very excited. - I've never been to a ball before. - Oh, no. No, no, no. Stepmothers never handle this well. My mother loves these parties. I feel like I've been to a thousand. That must be wonderful. Sure. Sometimes. Just not what I would choose if I could. I understand that. Well, um, since this is your first ball, maybe I could show you around? Make sure you have the perfect partner to dance with? Uh… Are there imperfect partners? Oh, yes. Stick with me. Your toes will be very happy you did. Well, then on their behalf, I thank you. And I accept. Then I am honored. Hmm. I'll give it to her! She likes me when I give her things. - But I'm the one who got it! - I'm the one that pulled you out. Any wand of Giselle's can't possibly be that powerful. But, I suppose I should see what I can do with it. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. Let's see. I wish… Mm-hmm? - …Ruby… - Oh. …was a toad. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, I'm a talking toad. I knew, I... Oh! Oh. - Phew. - Stupid chair! Mirror! What kind of magic is this? Ask any question and I shall appear. Well, that's an easy one. It's Andalasian magic, which means only a true son or daughter of Andalasia can, um… …use it. - Aah. - Mmm. Hello. Who are you? Grab him. Gotcha! Oh! Stop! Stop! He's a slippery little devil. - I'm ticklish over there. My tassels! - Oh, so cute! Careful of the fine print. I'm sorry. Did you say, "Ask any question"? Oh, no. Away. Poof! Away. Come... Poof! No, no, you're not going anywhere. I've got quite a number of questions. - Lots and lots and lots of questions. - Mm-hmm. So you're going to start from the beginning… Don't ask me. …or I might have to do a little editing. That's quite the bouquet. They're gonna match my dress perfectly, and they were growing wild just by the market. Aren't they beautiful? The world is truly a miracle. Oh, the most wonderful thing happened. Tyson asked me to the festival. Hmm. Thrilling. But I'm afraid you won't be attending the festival tonight after all. You have far too many chores to do. But I've done all my chores. What about the carpets in the hall? Awfully dusty. And the windows? I can't see a thing. And then there's the gardening and the sewing and the mending. And don't forget about the chimneys. Filthy business. Yes, perhaps there are a few that I've missed. - Oh, but surely they can wait... - Are you speaking back to me? No, of course not. I would never do such a thing. Perhaps you need to remember your place here. Until you do, you are not to leave this room, except for chores. And then only when I say. But I promised Tyson that I would be there. Oh, come now, Morgan. A boy like Tyson has plenty of options and, frankly, better ones. But not to worry. You can enjoy your evening from up here in your little perch. I'm sure it will be just as magical. That is sarcasm, isn't it? Huh. Not so hard to understand after all. - Stepmother. - Hmm? Stepmother, please. You can't... You can't be this cruel. Oh, I can't help it, dear. It's just who I am. No. No! No, you have to let me out! You can't be this cruel. Please! Please, you can't do this. Stepmother! Apples! Juicy apples! Ooh. Giant! Giant! A giant is coming? A giant, it's coming! Best take cover. Ah! Rope! Ha! Yes! What are you doing? I'm gonna take this rope and trip the giant. And then he or she will be mine! Oh, no! Oh! Oh, hey. It's all right. No! Help me! I'm stuck! - Oh! - Help! - Oh, no. - Please! Help! I'm coming! It's okay. It's okay. It's all done now. The big bad giant is gone. Bella! - Mommy! - Oh. Mom. I'm sorry! I turned away for one second! - We are in your debt, sir. - A true hero. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Thanks to you, our family is safe. I'm forever grateful. Hmm. Oh. Uh… Okay. Going somewhere? No, it's... It's not what you think. - I... - Hmm. I just have to tell him why I won't be there. Stepmother, please. I'll be home in no time at all. Oh, you're right. You will be. Because you're not going anywhere. Please! Please don't do this! Please... - Morgan? - Stepmother? Morgan. Are you okay? Never better! Now we're going back up to your tower. Oh, no. It can't be. Not yet. What are you talking about? Ambition. It's the last one, and then I'm fully her. What is going on? - Oh, Morgan. I'm so sorry. - What is... It's all my fault. I wished for a fairy-tale life, and it's all gone terribly wrong. Or terribly right. No. Wait! Poor sweet Giselle doesn't know what she wants, but I do. - Stepmother, please just... - Morgan, you have to listen to me. Oh, yes, yes. Perfect little Morgan, not so perfect now, is she? Don't you dare! Oh, I'll dare all I like. Stop it! You're... You're scaring me. I know. I wish I could do it myself, but who knows what would happen if I went over there like this? You have to go. Yes! Get help before it's too late. - And you have to do it before midnight. - Do what? Save us. Oh. Wretched girl! You three! You look like you're good with children. My precious darling needs tending to. See to it. Mmm. Oh, I feel superior to all living things. I don't know why we were fighting this. Indeed! Who knew that being a villain could feel so… liberating? Now, I just need to find that wand. What have we here? You know, stepmothers are many things. But one of the things we are not is powerful. That's why we have to go through all of these ridiculous manipulations. We have no power of our own. Now that Morgan's gone, I'm not a stepmother anymore. So I think it's time I took on a new role in this town. I'd like to be queen! Yeah, but there's already a queen, and I feel like she is really attached to the job. That should be easy enough to fix. A villain like Malvina can't resist a chance to show the world how bad she is. Mmm. So, where are we going? I say we give it to her. And then I have a little job for you, my pet. Ooh. Do I get to be evil now? Oh, yes. Oh. Uh-uh. Oh. - Hmm? - Mirror, mirror in her hand. Who is the most blatantly insecure woman, whose constant need to ask her own reflection for validation suggests that what she really needs to do is to love herself, in all the land? Giselle, a pleasure as always. Yes, I imagine it is. Well, I was hoping that I'd run into you, and look at this. It seems I have. So, what can I do for you then? I thought it only fair to give you a chance to hand Monrolasia over to me peacefully before any unpleasantness begins. Mmm? And why would I do that? Because this town is mine. I think we both know that, don't we? Oh… Oh. Sadly, I'm going to have to decline your generous offer. Having had a chat with your little scroll friend, it's clear that Monrolasia is everything it was meant to be, however that might have occurred. Hmm. Well, I tried. But if you won't accept the offer, you know there's only one thing that can happen. Indeed. Dance-off! You see what I gotta put up with? One of us has to die. Mmm. Say, midnight? Sounds about right. Again, I'm so sorry to ruin your little party with all of this messy "destroying you" business. Oh, Giselle. You're hilarious.

Oh. What happened? The well! Oh, no, no, no. Why am I so pointy? And my eyebrows are so perfect. What the heck am I wearing? Is this Andalasia? Wow. This is not what I pictured at all. - Morgan? - Nancy. What are you doing here? I'm not sure. Something weird happened. Did it, by any chance, include a giant hole in your sky? A what? What the heck is that? Last night, that mysterious hole appeared in the sky and started pulling all of our magic into some other place. Oh. Okay, Morgan, tell us what happened. Well, Giselle and I had a pretty bad fight. And then, uh… And then what? I'm not sure, exactly. But the last thing I remember is Giselle acting really, really cruel. And then she said something about making a wish and that I had to fix it. Oh, Edward. The wishing wand. She must have used it. But what could she have possibly wished for that would have done all this? Well, whatever it was, it turned our whole town into some kind of fairy-tale place. Just like Andalasia. Morgan, a wish so big that it changes a world wouldn't need a little of our magic. Why, it would... It would need all of it, every last bit. Wait. But everything here is made of magic. If it's all gone, then what happens to Andalasia? If we can't reverse this, everything Andalasian will be gone forever. I don't want Andalasia to disappear forever. - I know. I know. - No. There must be something we can do. Giselle just needs to remember who she is, and then she can fix all of this. I know she can. Remember? Edward! Of course. The magic of memories. What? You mean Giselle's memory tree? It's real? It is. And it's the strongest magic there is. Hello. Who are you? We're your garden fairies. - I'd turn around if I were you. - Unless you wanna get thrown off the roof. Hmm. Ah! Seems like the babysitters have had quite the day. So have I, dear. Hmm. Hmm. We're really going to need something more regal than this. And minions. We'll definitely need minions if we want anything done right. Where did you say Morgan was again? Oh. Who knows? - Hmm. - Probably singing to a mouse or something. But who cares? Tonight's about me. Stop the carriage. Whoa! Robert. Morgan wouldn't just disappear like this. Unless something's happened. Something's wrong. I'm going to go find her. Oh, well, another fruitless quest, but… …good luck with that. Drive! Hyah! Okay, I knew it was a tree house, but that's a "tree house." - We do whimsy really well. - Huh. I think the tree is over here. That's it. That's the tree! Oh, no. It's dead. Never fear. We will come up with something very smart at the very last minute that solves all our problems. Edward. What? That's how it works here. There has to be something we can do. You know, for a little girl with no mom, seeing a princess hanging from a billboard was magic. I-I knew it was real. I didn't even have to think about it. Things were so much easier back then. - I'll never forget you. - Whoa. What was that? You brought the flower back to life. I did? But how? I'm not magic. No, but these memories are. And they live inside you as well. Which means their magic does too. Morgan, you're the key. That's what Giselle meant by telling you to save us. So, maybe if I can bring some of this tree back, the magic in it will get her to remember that who she really is, is good. Then she'll fix this. I think we're running out of time. But what if it doesn't work? Morgan, it will. You just have to remember all the good in these moments because you're a part of them.

Instead, I'm here, babysitting you babysitting this wand. And all because she doesn't trust you. Or maybe she doesn't trust you. I'm not the one she tried to turn into a toad. Well, maybe she likes toads. No matter what reptile she turns you into, I am her right-hand lady. Which means that you should be doing the dumb stuff. And I should be looking fabulous at the festival. Okay, then go. And I'll tell Malvina that you abandoned the wand, and we'll see who ends up a warty toad. I would never be the warty toad. Look in a mirror lately? An honest one? Ooh. - Oh, it's gonna be like that? - Uh-huh. Well, I guess we will both just babysit the wand. I guess we will. Little advice. Get a life. She hates you both. - Whoo-hoo! - Look out! Incoming! Hey, Scroll! Scram! Watch it! If there are no more questions, goodbye. Oh! Let go of my tail! Okay. Ladies, have you learned nothing? Gotta be quicker than that. - How is he so fast? - Oh. Oh. - We can get him down. - Oh, hey, wait. Come on! And away we go! Hey, you ladies have been great, but I got a ball to catch. See you later. Do I look ready? There you are, my pet. Any problems? Nope. Turns out I'm good at evil. Well, now comes the fun part. I'm ready now. Hope I'm not under dressed. Oh, wait a second. What is this? Ooh. Ooh, yeah. Uh. Uh, hey! Wait a minute. I'm with her. Folks, this is my stop. Hello? Mr. Wig. Forgot abou... I'm with her. I gotta get out of here. Hey! Hey! Hey, what's happening? Wait a minute. You forgot about me! Hmm. Morgan, where have you been? Are you okay? No. Actually I'm really, really not. - Can I get a lift? - Of course. Go! I'll be right behind you. Now, let's see. I wish to be Queen of Monrolasia. Ah. Make way! Make way! We have to get inside. I believe you are in my seat. You again. And I believe it's time we end this once and for all. Oh, yes. Please. Stupid chair! Why does this keep happening? Is this my mother's doing? No, it's Andalasia. It's breaking through. Okay. Deep breath. Suck in. I wish. Guards. Destroy her. I wish. Mmm. They're just butterflies! Idiots! - Your Majesty! Your Majesty! - Oh. Ruby wants to tell you something about the wand. Oh, does she? Hi! It was her fault. She's the one that should be the toad. And you're the one who let the cat in. You two are the worst! Huh? Hmm. Speaking of toads. I wish. - Nancy! - Robert! Have you seen Morgan? - Yes. She's here. She's fine. - Oh, thank goodness. My God, people are going crazy. I know. I know. Listen, it's Giselle. She's under a curse. We have to save her so she can stop this. A curse? Let's go! Morgan! Dad! Dad! How have you fared? Oh! I have searched both hither and yon. We need to get inside. Let's go. When did my daughter become so brave? Now we save Giselle. Time to be heroes. Need a hand? - Mother, stop this! - Giselle! Hmm. Useless garbage. No! Giselle, no! This is a very nice place. - Yeah. - This is a date. - She's very kind and very sweet. - Yeah. - Giselle! - I'm right here, Morgan. Hey, wait for me! Mom, where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. You'll always be a princess to me. Higher! Higher, Mom! Uh-oh. What the heck is going on around here? Uh, Giselle! Oh. Robert. My sweet Giselle. You've come back to me. I'm so sorry. I don't want minions. Nancy, where's Edward? He stayed behind to protect Andalasia. Oh, no. Please, we have to hurry. The magic is disappearing. We have to stop this or everything Andalasian will die. And that means that you… Will? No. No, I... I can fix this. Stop! I wouldn't if I were you. Morgan. Morgan! - Mother, what are you doing? - Oh, relax, darling. It's just a little sleeping potion. It was actually meant for Giselle, but this'll do. Malvina, you have to undo it. Oh, and I shall. Your helpful scroll explained at the last stroke of midnight, your wish is permanent. And I like this world. So you're going to drop that wand and let the clock strike, and then, she'll be free. But if I do that, Andalasia dies. And if you don't do it, she dies. - No. - Cease, evil witch. Oh, Robert. Don't you think you're being a little harsh? Malvina, please. This isn't you. It is now. Just as you wished it. No! Morgan. Oh. I feel weak. Giselle. Giselle. What's happening? - Are you okay? - I don't know. No. Isn't it marvelous when two worlds come together in such… harmony? When the clock strikes 12:00, the spell will be set. No. - This is not how it ends. - Huh. I'm coming with you. Robert. Some heroes. - What are we gonna do? - It can't strike midnight! It's like a wish come true. Please hold on. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. No, no, no. There has to be something else that we can do. - I just wish… - No. That piece of wand. Grab it. Ticktock, ticktock. Tyson, your sword! Hold on! Morgan. You can't break magic. Listen to me. You have to make a new wish, Morgan. My magic is almost gone. Oh, according to your droll little scroll, no one but a true Andalasian can use that broken piece of kindling. But go for it. She's right. I can't. I'm not a true daughter of Andalasia.

I wish I was home… with my mom. Oh, yes, sweet thing. Mom. Morgan. Mom! You did it! I was so scared. I know. But you saved me. You saved us all. Good morning. Oh. I had the craziest dreams last night. Good morning. He really doesn't remember anything? Only the person who wields the magic ever really remembers it clearly. To everyone else, it's sort of like a dream. Well, I can't wait for you to explain to him how he sang with a garbage pail and defeated an evil queen. Good luck with that. I had a horrible dream about toads. Me too. Good morning, Edgar. Giselle, the usual? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. Good morning. I'm sorry to interrupt. I just thought I'd say hi. And I really wanted to apologize for a lot of things. I just really wanted Morgan to be happy here, and I guess I got a little carried away. Okay. Enjoy your coffees. You know… Um, I have the tendency to get carried away myself sometimes. No. It turns out we do have room on one of our committees, if you'd be interested. Mmm. Hmm? I think our town could use someone like you. I'd love that. - Oh! - Oh, we're hugging. Okay. - Not your chair. - Oh, right. Nope. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. And so, a new story for Giselle and her family began in Monroeville. Without the magic this time. Robert opened a small practice in town, and never rode the train again. Sofia sprouted up. - And Morgan… - Hey, Morgan! - Um, I'll be back in a sec. - Mm-hmm. Well, she was still a teenager. - Stop looking at me. It's creepy. - No, I'm just... - Not looking! - Gonna pour some... - I am so sorry I'm late. - Oh! - There was a gaggle of hobgoblins… - That's okay. …In the woods today. They just wouldn't give up. It took the whole village to drive 'em out. Where is Edward? Did he stay behind? Oh, no, no, no. He's here. He's engaged in battle. - Of course. - Back, you wild beasts! Back! You're dead! No, I'm not. You merely grazed me. You grazed me! I'm not dead. Look, I have barely a limp! Your tiny peasants are quite fierce. - As are you, Robert… - Oh, no. …who so grandly helped save the day with my sword. Well, may your adventures with my sword continue, my good man. - Actually, Edward. I've hung up the sword. - Ah. I'm happy to say I don't really need it here. - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. - What a tragedy. Can I have it back? Yes. Of course you can. - Okay.
