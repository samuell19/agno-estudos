(orchestral music) (birds calling) (monkeys chittering) (engine revving) Wondering if Johnson got plenty pictures monkey. Not much film left. We got plenty of film back at our base. Film at base not help bwana catch animal pictures for museum today. I suppose you're right. (monkeys chittering) (orchestral music) Hadji, do you see anything up in those trees besides monkeys? No, bwana, what do you see? Thought I caught a glimpse of a man. (laughs) a white man. I've heard many stories about jungle boy who live in tree vine. But Hadji not believe it. Start the car forward, slowly. (orchestral music) I'm afraid he's gone. Not gone, bwana, never was there. Don't be too sure. (tense orchestral music) Now what? Bwana come here to take animal pictures for museum. Look, please. (touching classical music) Very fine specimen. Come, bwana. Lucky we're downwind. (tense orchestral music) The longer lens, Hadji. (orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (mimicking bird call) (laughing) Look, bwana. (lighthearted orchestral music) Get the car, Hadji, quickly. (lighthearted orchestral music) Faster, Hadji, faster. Drive smoothly, Hadji, smoothly! Bwana save drive fast, bwana say drive smooth. Which way bwana want? Both. Yes, bwana. (orchestral music) Where'd he go? Gone under. Well he can't stay under forever. Maybe can do, bwana. Them say him part devil. You don't believe that, hey Hadji? There he is, bwana. No, it's too far away to mean anything even with this long lens. Let's go back and see if The Amir can tell us anything about this jungle boy. (dramatic orchestral music) [Man] Your lord, may, Abraham Benghazi from the village of Renditi. Ah, Johnson, effendi. You do us a great honor by making the Hidden City the base for your photographic expedition. A seat for our friend, quickly. I just had, um, an amazing experience, your excellency. I hope that you can explain it for me. I am of the village of Stanbul. I have here our tribute and also orders not to surrender it without an accounting. What kind of an accounting, my friend? What happens to all this? You will have to go to my superiors for that. I am only the district Amir. You are not even the true Amir. You usurped the office when Saud Farraza was killed. Saud Farraza was a good governor and my friend. When he was killed, of course I took his office. I was his Lieutenant, next in line to succeed him. Your authority to rule has never been confirmed. Nor has anyone been sent to replace me. Until such time, I must obey my superiors and levy taxes even though I may not believe in them. You say that Saud was a good governor yet he was killed, surely not by his own people? Oh no, effendi, by the invaders in the war. They reached even to this tiny outpost of our motherland, the Hidden City, as we call it. Saud had a wife and child. I begged him to flee with them to the jungle, with the Europeans, but he was loyal to his people and remained. But the articles of war wouldn't permit the... I saw it happen, effendi. It wasn't very pleasant. How did you manage to escape? All is fair in war. I let them believe that I would collaborate with them. Ah, Raschid, what brings you here? Surely no village would trust you to bring its taxes. No excellency, that they wouldn't. I mean no sire, I bring no taxes. Come to the point, Raschid. Well, it is rumored about the bazaars and marketplaces that one of the girls in your excellency's household escaped that this sheep fled from your protection. That is just a rumor. Oh yes, just a rumor. Just, well. I talked with her as she passed through my village. You saw her and didn't return her to me? That's the favor I would do your excellency, I would substitute a girl who is more beautiful and more loyal. I can picture the girl you might suggest. Has your excellency every heard of a girl named Zidah of the village of Kampani? Very well. Who is her father, so that I may ask his consent? Raschid, your excellency, at your service. You, her father? Tell the maidens of your village that I will see them two days from now. Now, be off. Your excellency will bless this day and me with it. I hope. Getting back to my experience, Hassan. Ah, yes. Have you had any reports of a half wild jungle boy in the woods here abouts? Jungle boy, effendi? He seems to live with the animals. The natives call him Bomba. Say he's sort of a jungle demon. Suppose we discuss it later when I've finished here. I have no idea who this Bomba, as you call him, may be, Effendi. I've heard stories about him, but I assume they were merely folktales. Naturally but now that we know there is such a person it doesn't seem right to let him go running wild through the jungle. I'd like your permission to track him down. Of course. If you need any more men, you have only to ask. I have enough men for one party but I was hoping your highness might outfit a second group to work with us. Better still, I shall lead them myself. When do you say we start? Why not tomorrow? Fine. You heard, Abdullah? The party will be ready by sunrise, excellency. And now with your highness's permission, I'll retire and begin my preparations. Granted before you asked, Effendi. It must be the same one, Abdullah, eh? There could hardly be two alike. Will your highness see if have arranged our shares equitably? If the American should capture Bomba and learn the truth, there would be no more taxes to divide, Abdullah. Have no fear, your highness. He won't be captured alive. I shall be with the party. (tense orchestral music) Go hide. (tense orchestral music) Hello, Hassan. Greetings, Effendi. Your party is heavily armed. You're not intending to kill the boy are you? Of course not. They're just a few precautions against animals. You found no sign of him, I suppose? None. (tense orchestral music) Are you quite sure you really saw him or did your imagination... Come quick, bwana. I found tracks of jungle boy. (tense orchestral music) Right here, boss. The grass is too heavy. I don't see any tracks. Bwana not have trackers eyes. Look, go up tree. See, bwana? (uplifting orchestral music) I see him. (gunshot) You fool, you came to capture the boy not to kill him. I did not shoot him, Effendi, I only cut the vine he was on. And the fall may have killed him. I see you're not to be trusted with this. We have no time to waste in wrangling. Come. (tense orchestral music) (monkeys hollering) (tense orchestral music) I'm certain he fell somewhere near here. Scatter out and search under every bush. And remember, the boy is not to be harmed. (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (groans) Where is the boy? I saw him, what happened to him? I think he saw me, Effendi, and killed himself rather than be taken alive. If you had called to us, this would not have happened. I was afraid that he would hear my shout and escape, excellency. I guess there's no hope, my friend. Wait, he can stay under there an impossible length of time. He did it yesterday. (tense orchestral music) - Good morning, Zidah. - Good morning. Aren't you going to join us? No, no thank you. Well you know that Hassan is to visit our village today. So I have heard. Why don't you make ready then? Bathe, perfume yourself. I have seen the Amir. He's a lizard. (lighthearted orchestral music) We mustn't let her cheat herself, come on. Oh no. Please. (all giggling) (screaming) You mustn't move, please, I'll go for help. (touching orchestral music) Don't be frightened, I'm a friend. Drink this, it will give you strength. Who are you? I am Zidah, of the house of Raschid. Drink. And you? I am Bomba. Of what house? No house. Bomba live in cave. What's this for? To heal your wound. It's not serious and I sealed it against further bleeding. How were you hurt? Man try catch Bomba. One throw knife. But why? Not know. Bomba not hurt man. What's that? Nothing to be afraid of. Lie still and I'll see. It's nothing. Only the villagers greeting the visitors from the Hidden City. In the name of our village, greetings to his excellency, Hassan Amir. You're over stepping yourself, Raschid. I am head man of the village. No offense, Mhekmed, no offense but it is business with me that has brought them here. I'll go to fetch my daughter. Not so fast, Raschid. Your daughter hasn't been chosen yet. First I must see the other maidens of the village. But there are no other maidens, excellency. Only hags, some as old as 19. You speaking of my daughter Alita? No, Mhekmed, no but at your advanced age, you need her to care for you. Suppose you call the other maidens so that my decision will be a fair one? (shouting in foreign language) Come quickly. So you're still tending this boy you fished from the river and moved into my tent? Allah dropped him into my hands, father and you know hospitality is the first law of the prophet. Yes, it's very easy to be generous with someone else's property. Hurry, Zidah, before his excellency makes a bad choice and I will lose my chance at honors and riches. (sniffing) You smell of medicine and goat's broth. Here, my mother's wedding veil, put it on and some rouge on your cheeks and purple on your eyes. As for you, I will be pleased to have my bed once again when you are finished with it. Bomba not understand. The Amir has come to choose a new maiden for his household. That not good? [Zidah] For some maybe but not me. Then better run away to jungle. With you? No. Well I couldn't live in the jungle alone. Then better go with Amir. She's beautiful and almost entirely recovered from sleeping sickness. I don't think his excellency will chose me for my beauty. You try to sleep, I won't be gone long. Charming, isn't she, excellency? You're walking without a stick now, Alita, rheumatism no longer bothers you then, hey? Rheumatism? Oh there you are, my dear. Zidah, where did you get these clothes? Nevermind now, come on, come on. Come on. Your search is over, your highness. Behold Zidah, Zidah my lovely one. You see? His highness is stupefied by my daughter's beauty. This is what you call beauty? What have they done to you? You would do that to me? Make a fool of me before his excellency and rob me of my place at court. Your excellency must forgive my daughter's little joke. She only did it to entertain you. Oh she's got a great talent for entertaining, sire. She dances and sings and makes wonderful spice cakes. What do you think, Abdullah? Do think she'd be a wise choice for my household? As you say, sire. It wouldn't take you long to pack a few things, would it? I don't... Oh she doesn't have much to pack, your excellency. We have been poor up till now. Run along, child, we mustn't keep his excellency waiting. Run along. What do you think of my choice, Johnson Effendi? She didn't seem too happy about it. She's very young. Yes, very. Wait, excellency. You must, we have forgotten to discuss the details of our little bargain. My father sold me to that lizard but I swear I... Bomba? Bomba? Zidah, his excellency is waiting. You mustn't make him impatient or he... Zidah, Zidah where have you hidden? Zidah? Zidah? Sound the alarm, Mhekmed, my daughter has gone, disappeared. What nonsense. How could she disappear? Oh it must be that boy. I knew from the first that he had come to put a curse on my house. Stop babbling, what is this talk about a boy? She fished him from the river. I knew that he was a devil, I warned her but no she had to give him shelter, tend to his wound. The jungle boy, it must be. Send a runner back to Hidden City. Bring some of my men, all of them armed. Why the guns, your excellency? You think the boy should live after dragging that child off into the jungle? We don't know that she was taken by force. Perhaps, she wanted to go. You think she would prefer life in some cave to the ease and comfort of Hidden City? It's not impossible. If that prove to be the case, I assure you... Men will be here by dawn, excellency. Search will start the moment they arrive. You have sleeping quarters available in the village? My courthouse is at your disposal, your excellency. Maybe bwana think it's good idea we start search now? A very good idea but where do we start to search? You and I go this way, people say. Must go by river. We better separate so no one will suspect. We'll meet somewhere outside the village and decide what to do. (lighthearted orchestral music) Bomba! Bomba! Why didn't you wait for me? You must of heard me calling you. Go home. Why did you take off the medicine I put on? This better. Let me help you. Go home. But I only did what you told me to do. You said to run away. Say run away to jungle, not follow Bomba. Well how am I gonna eat? Same as Bomba. Same as monkeys. (monkeys screeching) (lighthearted orchestral music) Bomba! Bomba! Help me, I'm caught. (tense orchestral music) Bomba, help me, he'll kill me! Bomba, Bomba! (tense orchestral music) Get vines, quick! Tie feet. Hurry, hurry. Tie feet, I can't hold. Go home. Haven't you any gratitude? Didn't I pull you out of the river and save your life? Bomba save Zidah's life, too. Well won't it die if you leave it this way? Break loose, soon. Look. (lighthearted orchestral music) Why do we have to go in here? Lose tracks, men not follow. But it's too muddy, I'll get all dirty. Go home then. Oh Bomba help me, I'm stuck. You can't leave me here. (screams) (laughing) You look funny. You think you look pretty? Bomba, we mustn't go in the river, it's very deep and I can't swim. Zidah not swim? No. Goodbye. (lighthearted tense orchestral music) Cross over here, bwana, lose tracks. Looks like the girls still with him. Yes, bwana. Well I suppose there's only one thing to do. See if you can find a log we can float our gear on. The sun is low. It will be dark soon and I'll be afraid. If Zidah afraid why she come to jungle? Because I'm more afraid of Hassan and because I like you very much. Don't you like me just a little? No. (lighthearted tense orchestral music) You make Bomba much trouble. Stand in hands. Why? Climb tree. What for? Sleep. In that? You like sleep on ground with snakes and scorpions? (soft orchestral music) (apes chittering) (tense orchestral music) Sorry, bwana, sun up high. So it is. We should of been on our way an hour ago. I found trail, bwana, not very easy to see. One consolation, it will be just as hard for Hassan to find. (soft tense orchestral music) Bomba? Bomba! (touching orchestral music) good morning. Every morning a good morning. You frightened me. I thought you'd run away. Bomba not run away, Bomba hungry. Let me do this. You go catch another. For yourself. Why you make smoke? Men see, find Bomba. These smoke in trees might be Bomba. Zidah much trouble, make smoke spoil fish. You can catch another one. Cannot catch smoke. Someone see. Maybe you want men find Bomba. You want men find Bomba? No, Bomba. You're hurting my arm. Bomba go now. You stay. Please, Bomba. Would you send me back to Hassan? No, go home to father. The same thing, he'd send me to Hassan. You not like father? I don't know. He's usually good to me but he doesn't love me. All father love child. But he, he's not really my father. Where father? Bomba take you to him. I don't know where he is. You see, I don't even know who I am. No really, Bomba. One day I woke from a deep sleep. I was in the jungle. Who I was, where I came from, I remembered nothing. I only knew that I was afraid, as if someone were chasing me to kill me. So I ran and ran and when I could run no farther Raschid found me. He took me into his house and raised me as his own daughter. You don't believe me? Yes, Bomba believe. Maybe Bomba know who you are. What do you mean, Bomba? How could you know who I am? One day, long time ago, Bomba in jungle hear many guns. He swing through tree to see why they shoot. Men not hurt you. Bomba go, come back soon, help Zidah. Good morning, Zidah. Good morning. You gave us quite a chase but I guess we found you in time. Where's the jungle boy? Jungle boy? What would I know of a jungle boy? I fled from Hassan and his men. Listen, I know he was with you and I know you want to protect but you've go to trust me. Hassan's men are looking for him and if they find him I think they intend to kill him. Oh Effendi, they mustn't kill him. He knows my true identity. He was going to tell me when he saw you and ran away. You mean you don't know. No, all I remember is... Good morning. You travel fast, Hassan. I was several hours of ahead of you. You followed a dim trail. Your boot heels made it simpler for my men. Where's the boy? Zidah says she hasn't seen him. Look around, his footprints are everywhere. Scatter out. Deal with him as you would any other animal. Just a minute, please. What has he done to deserve this treatment? Did he not kidnap this poor child? He did not. He tried to send me home but I wouldn't go. Even so, it was you, Effendi, who said that he should be captured. I suggest you leave his capture up to me. It will be safer for everybody. I don't think I understand. The last time your men searched for him he was almost killed, oh by accident, of course. Your real meaning is still not clear, Effendi. If another such accident should happen I would be force to report it to your superiors. An investigation might prove awkward. As you say. It is of very little importance to me. Abdullah, prepare a litter for Zidah. With your excellency's permission, I'll take up the trail. I'll see you later at the Hidden City. Girl says she not know who she is, what that mean, bwana? I'm not sure, Hadji, but if it means what I suspect both she and the boy are in real danger from Hassan. (low tense orchestral music) Welcome to the Hidden City, my child. What's the matter, Zidah, are you ill? No I, I have the strangest feeling that I've been here before, your excellency and yet I know I haven't. I'm sure you haven't. Or we would of known it. Come, let me show you your new home. It has some advantages over your father's tent. Oh its lovely, your excellency but I am not used to such splendor. If you please, I think I'd be happier at home with my father. But your father will be here with you, my child. [Raschid] In fact, he's already here ready to welcome you and pay his respects to his excellency. You take strange liberties with another's home during his absence, Raschid. Oh, thousands of pardons your sire, I must have fallen asleep while waiting for your excellency. Waiting for me? Why? To discuss the office to be assigned to me in your household in return for my consent. Ah, and what office would you be willing to accept? Grand Vizier? Oh your highness, you flatter me. I hardly aspire... The keeper of the district purse, perhaps? That would do admirably. The keeper of... Keeper of the gate, that's what you will be. The gate keeper... Either that or you go back to your goats and chickens. Choose. I accept, oh yes, I accept, your excellency, I accept. Yes, yes. Never will I forget your excellency's generosity, never. You're tired, my dear. Follow these girls. They will prepare your bath and give you suitable clothes. No, your excellency I... There will be time for talk later. And may the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your beard. It is not likely the firangi will be able to capture the jungle boy. Has it occurred to your highness he may go back to the coast for help? In that case, he will need his car. So? So, might be wise to remove some of its parts as a temporary measure, of course. Your highness thinks of everything. Keeper of the gate. May the fleas of two thousand camels nest in his beard. Abdullah is a man of many parts. Firangi may return to the coast. The engine must be in good order. Oh oh. And uh, will it run better with that part missing? I'm taking it with me to repair it. Oh. Don't mention a thing to him. I wish no offense. (lighthearted tense orchestral music) (lighthearted tense orchestral music) (lighthearted orchestral music) Bomba. Quiet, night come soon, Bomba help. How did you get in here? No time talk. Where Bomba hide? There's no place to hide in here. I know. (knocking at door) [Hassan] Zidah, may I come in? Not yet, excellency, in one moment. Storeroom at the end of the passage. (knocking at door) [Hassan] Zidah. Coming, excellency. We have come to escort you to... Couldn't the girls find you any better clothes than these? Call them at once. No, no please. These other clothes they brought were, they didn't fit. I believe there are some new clothes in the store room that would fit her. Are there not, Abdullah? Yes, excellency. Don't trouble yourself, sire. Let me find them. Show me the way. The trunks are probably locked. Storeroom is at the end of the passage. I thought I heard a muffled cry for help, sire. I heard nothing but you better have a look, anyway. Ah, this is the one. These are enough, sire, more than enough. Excellency, there is an intruder hiding somewhere on the grounds. No one could get past my guard. The guard on the roof has been attacked and left bound and gagged, sire. Who would dare such an outrage? Open it. That's enough. Please don't kill him, excellency. I'll send him away, I promise. Send him away, after all the trouble we've been through to capture him? What have you told the firangi, Johnson? Aren't we wasting time, Sire? Bullet through the head... I must find out how much he told Johnson so I will know how to proceed. Tie him up. Get out. Welcome to the Hidden City, Effendi. Thank you, Raschid. I suppose Hassan has returned with your daughter. Yes, Effendi. She's happily installed in his excellency's household. You mean you're happily installed. Bad thing, bwana. Make girl slave. Very bad thing, Hadji. If I could get out of there, I'd take her to the coast. Maybe find a way, bwana. Better turn the car around, anyway, in case we want to leave in a hurry. Please, excellency, you will kill him. I think not. It is well for you to see what happens to those who displease me. He's very stubborn, sire. I will leave him to you. When he's ready to talk, call me. Perhaps, I should tell Effendi that Abdullah removed a small part of the engine to repair it. That's very kind of Abdullah. Very kind of you to tell us. Effendi, Johnson Effendi. They have the jungle boy in the storeroom. They're killing him. Where is it, how can I get to him? The stairway from the roof. I'll be waiting to show you. Hold it, Abdullah. Tie him up, Hadji. Search him for that missing motor part. Lie down, face on the floor, please. Lie down! They'll pay for this. I don't know how but they'll pay. Zidah says that you know who she really is. Part true. Bomba see Hassan shoot man, shoot woman. This girl run, Hassan chase Bomba because he see. Does that help you remember? [Zidah] I seem to remember a little and then it all goes again. [Johnson] Well is any of this familiar to you? No but when they brought me here, I felt sure that I had been here before. This man and woman Hassan shoot. That's the old governor of the Hidden City. Does the name Saud mean anything to you? Saud Farraza? Do you know these people? Yes, I know them. But I cannot remember. And the girl? Why it is I. Yes, and your parents, whom Hassan had murdered so that he could become governor. It is unfortunate that you made this discovery, Effendi. (gunshot) (gunshots) (grunts) [Hadji] That shot will bring the other guard. We can escape by the roof. We better march out front. The guards know your father, he can lead us out the gate. (lighthearted tense orchestral music) Guards, guards! Guards, help! I'm in the storeroom. (lighthearted tense orchestral music) Guards, guards! (gunfire) (tense orchestral music) I can't outrun them. Forget me, look after yourselves. Oh we can't do that. We separate, make hard to follow. Hadji, that way. You, that way. (lighthearted tense orchestral music) (gunshot) (lighthearted tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) Drop rifle, don't make noise. Drop rifle. Go back Hidden City. (tense orchestral music) (man grunting) (lighthearted music) (Bomba laughs) (lighthearted tense orchestral music) (gunshot) (gunshot) (gunfire) (lighthearted tense orchestral music) (laughing) (gun clicks) (lighthearted tense music) (Bomba laughing) (lighthearted tense music) (screaming) (tense orchestral music) (screaming) (crowd shouting) As you all know, Hassan Amir is dead and Abdullah is in chains. I'm leaving the Hidden City for the coast where I'll report the episode in detail to the authorities. If you agree, Zidah, the daughter of the old governor, will remain to rule temporarily, at least. Where is Zidah? And where is the jungle boy so that we may thank him for ridding us of the tyrant? (crowd cheering) They mean no harm, Bomba, they're only grateful for what you've done. Bomba go now. This is your home now, Bomba. Bomba's home in jungle. You will come back to the Hidden City someday, won't you? Bomba come back, see all his friends. But mostly you. (touching orchestral music) (adventurous tense music)
