When I close my eyes, the dialogue sounded great. Truthfully, I've worked a year and 1/2 on a play that I will never be able to watch objectively 'cause I gave it to you, Kurt. Trusting you to make something great out of it. You know what? The rest of the world may find it great. I hope they do. But unless God who I was trashing in that scene drops a safe on this motherfucker, I am fucked. - Chris, c'mon. - Maybe God'll help you write an ending. - I'm gonna leave right now because as usual God is smiling on you. - Okay, let's take a break. - Is this girl even Black, huh?

[soft intriguing music] [police radio chattering] - He was this amazin' bass player. Sweetest guy in a while. [siren wailing] Except he had a terrible coke habit. He hit me one time and I was outta there. - Where'd he hit you? - He wanted to pawn his bass, so I hid it so he couldn't find it. Look, I know I shoulda told you. It's just that I'm not used to talkin' about my past. I know you used to be in with a nice girl. - You are nice girl. - Yeah, well I ain't no virgin. I know that she was. I don't know much more than that. I wasn't tryin' to be nosy. Maybe I was. I'm sorry. - Let me tell you somethin', all right? When I met Leslie, she was a virgin and she was religious and I was neither. And after we slept together, there was this period of time that she'd make me feel guilty for takin' her virginity. Take and give. You know me, I just lost it. I paid 30 bucks to a hooker on 11th Avenue years ago. I'm not proud of it, you know? I'm not ashamed of it. It's just part of my past. Everyone has one. - I don't wanna scare you or anything, But I think I'm fallin' in love with you. [soft solemn music] Don't run, okay? Okay, don't feel like you have to say anything. Just don't run. [Lenore moaning pleasurably] - I can't believe you'd give up after marry some guy that won't go down on you. So apparently Leslie's gonna take her boyfriend to the wedding. - Yes. - Well that should be very interesting. - Yeah. Look, Kenny. I know you wanna come to the wedding with Nancy. But considering I didn't send you an invitation, you didn't get the hint from that. Just get the idea out of your mind. I don't need to see you on my wedding day so I can feel like a slut, 'kay? - Is that how I make you feel? - Just don't show up at my wedding, Kenny. [water pattering] [Chris laughing] - I'm sorry.

Right, James. I bet mom loves him. - You want me to go? - No. No. [sighs] So James. Do you love James? - Yes. - God bless you. - I should go. You know, when I first started workin' at the restaurant, I remember we were all in non-smokin' and everybody was smokin'. Everybody except me, of course. Kevin, Wallace and Reggae, they were all there. Guess it must've been the first night that Ethan brought Robert in because they were all makin' fun of him, you know? Laughin' at him, goin' up to him. It was real mean. Then you came in. You weren't workin' because you were wearin' that beat-up leather jacket. Guess you were checkin' your schedule or somethin' and you asked everybody "What was so funny?" and they told you. And you said, "Oh well. At least they're not goin' home alone." And then you turned around and you walked out the door past the window. In my heart, I remember thinkin' to myself who is that guy? [soft solemn music] And a week later, I kissed you and there was lightning. I guess. I guess I started to feel like Ethan and Robert must have. No people staring, her parents. So I stayed in. I thought we were safe, you know? - Why were you upset that time when you found out you weren't pregnant? - I don't know. I guess I always felt like I was losin' you. You know, I wanted to be married and you didn't. I wanted to stay in that room with you. I don't love him like I love you, but I still love you.

[Chris breathing heavily] [soft solemn music] - No. [weeps] All my fault. [Chris sobbing] My fault. - Ensure uncertain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to almighty God our brother Raymond and we commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The Lord bless him and keep him. The Lord make his face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him. The Lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace. Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. - Fear no evil. - [Both] For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. - [Father] I'm sorry he lost you, son. [birds chirping] - Your mom? - Yeah. - Where's your father? - He's buried over that way. - Why aren't they buried together? - Some family bullshit, I don't know. I mean they were never really close. My mom used to sleep on the couch a lot. So the fact that they're buried apart is. If someone did somethin' or said somethin' that they couldn't take back. - When did you hear that word for the first time? See, most Black people remember where they heard that word for the first time, but I guess you wouldn't remember. I should go. - It was at the dinner table. My father sat at the dinner table. Some rhyme, stupid limerick. That's where I heard it. You know, my mom wanted me to be a writer. - What did you wanna be? - Right now, I just wanna be happy. - [Jeanine] Do you think that you can be? - You could make me happy. - Yeah? I don't believe that. When did I make you happy? - Many times. That time you told me about that guy when you wouldn't let him pawn his bass 'cause you knew how important it should be. That made me happy. - Yeah, you know what that got me, right? - My heart. You're so beautiful, Jeanine. I know I never told you that and I'm sorry, so sorry. - You know, a week ago, that might've meant everything to me. - What about now? - Well it's nice but- - I know it's just words. I'm tired of words. I gotta go visit my father. - Yeah, I got this ride waiting for me. - I could give you a lift if you wouldn't mind comin' with me to visit him. - Yeah, he'd like that. [soft solemn music] [birds chirping] No, I should go. Listen, the band that I'm with, we're gonna be playing in Hoboken next month. Maybe you should come. - Okay.
