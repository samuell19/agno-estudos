San Francisco. She's getting married. Married? To whom? Steven Beck. The becks of San Francisco? She certainly knows how to pick them. Let's hope it lasts. Why shouldn't it? As long as he never finds out, I guess there's no reason. Oh, the ballet is opening next week. I picked up a couple of tickets. They're doing swan lake. Swan lake-- my favorite. You remembered. How could I ever forget? [ Car radio blares ] Excuse me! You're half an hour late. I know. My car broke down.That's a lie. I couldn't get it started! Lil, I know. I'm gonna change-- look at you. You're a mess. You know the dress code. Your nails are chipped, your makeup's not fresh, your hair's not combed-- oh, but -- there are no "buts" when you work for me, April. You either live by my rules. Or you're out. Oh, come on!That's it, April. No more second chances. [ Tires squeal ] [ Honks horn ] [ Classical music plays on lil's radio ] Which way are you going?

Where are you from? Mccook, Nebraska. That's quite a ways. Yeah, especially on a bus. It took forever to get here. Well, do you have anyone here? Oh, my friend Cindy, yeah. She's been here for about three months, and she's been calling me and telling me how great it is here. I decided to come and surprise her, you know, just show up. Does she know you're in town yet? She wasn't at the number she gave me. She probably went out for a while. Her line's disconnected. Hey, Charlie. How ya doin'?Good. You look sensational.Thank you. Perrier and lime, right?

You're gonna be the lady of the house. It's your decision. The future Mrs. Steven Beck. Thank you, Thomas. [ Phone rings ] Excuse me, madam. Hello? Lil? It's Wendy. Wendy, where are you? I'm still at the hotel. What are you doing there? He's been gone for hours. Oh, I just felt like hanging out here alone for a while. I'm sorry I didn't call you earlier. Yeah, I'm leaving now. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye. Are you sure my hair is all right? You look gorgeous. Well, what if they don't like me? Will you relax? They're gonna love you, okay? Come on. [ Quiet conversation ] [ Remarks inaudible ] Steven tells me your family is in the east. We'd like to plan something. Do you know how soon your parents will be arriving? They won't be at the wedding. Oh? Yes, my mother passed away several years ago, and my father isn't very well. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know. If you would like, we can adjourn to the living room for coffee. Hi, honey. Uncle Edgar was just touting the virtues of married life. He and aunt Mary are celebrating their 25th anniversary. Congratulations. Thank you. Same to you two.Thank you. Excuse me. I'll meet you in the living room. She's so gorgeous, and yet so insecure. Part of her charm, I guess. Where did you two meet? The Bahamas. And old college chum rented a yacht and, uh... She was there with a girlfriend. It was love at first, uh... I've never met anyone like her. How long have you known her? Six weeks. Steven, it's not really any of my business, but why don't you two live together? Why rush into marriage? Because I'm in love with her. Six weeks -- what do you know about her? Enough to know that I want her to be my wife. What do you know about her family? I'm not gonna marry her family. Do you know what she does for a living? She works at a public relations firm. Is that what they call it these days? Oh, Steven, don't be so naive. What in hell are you talking about? She's a pro! What are you saying? A high-class whore! Now, that's a lie! Is it? Why don't you call up your old college chum and ask him? I'vehad her, Steven, and so has anyone else who has a grand a night to pay for her! Steven. Are you all right? You hardly said a word during dinner. I love you so much. Make me... Make me feel good. Oh, Steven... Oh, baby... Yeah, baby. Give me the thousand-dollar- a-night treatment. What did you say? I called my old college chum to check out your story. There seems to be some discrepancy in the way you two met. Steven-- you say it was on a plane going to New York, and he says it was through some high-class madam in Beverly Hills. No! Oh, yeah. Her girls are supposed to be the best-- and the most expensive. It's true, isn't it? He paid you ten grand for that week. No, no! He's lying! Don't lie to me! It's humiliating enough falling in love with a thousand-dollar- a-night whore! Steven, we love each other. You're a whore! What do whores know about love? Oh, god, no! [ Crying ] No! Sorry. I had to take a call. She was beautiful. Yes. How old was she when this was taken? Twenty-three. That was taken during our honeymoon. She wore this on our wedding night. It's lovely. How long were you married? Next week would be our 40th. Did she always wear her hair back in a French twist? Always. Man: Your first constitutional law mid-term will be in one week.

[ Bell rings ]Now, if you-- Once he's in bed, he'll want you to take your hair down and comb it. When he turns out the light, that's your cue to join him. Ha ha! Comb my hair? How weird! April, don't you ever forget that you're selling fantasy. This man needs you to help work out his loss through your fantasy. Now hold still. I hear Diana's only taking a 50-50 split with her girls now. Wasn't Sheila tary hers? Uh-huh. One of her top girls. I hear she's in bad shape. Whoever he was, I hear the freak cut her up good. You're great, you know that, lil? You know just what to say when a girl's ready to take a walk. You know my policy, April. Whenever you're unhappy, you know where my front door is. What did you say her name was again? Jenny. He may call you Jen. It's time for bed... Jenny darling. My Jen. My darling Jenny. Oh, Jenny... Darling Jenny... [ Crying ] [ Sobbing ] There's got to be one lousy cigarette in this room. Ohh! You got nothing on me. [ Phone rings ] Hello? Julie-- Julie? No, no-- calm down, Julie. I'll take care of it. Sorry to wake you up. I need a favor. Julie? I'm Douglas Corbin. Lil sent me down to get you. I didn't do anything! I was just standing there, and the cops started arresting everybody in sight. Lil's taken care of it, they've dropped the charges against you. Did they do that to you in here? No, I was mugged this morning. They took my suitcase, my purse, and everything. You've had quite a day. How is she? Badly bruised, but more emotionally than physically. Did she ever find her girlfriend?No. I didn't think she would. There's something about her that reminds me of you when we first met. The shiner? Probably because I was that naive. Probably a combination of both. You did have the worst shiner I've ever seen. Well, so would you if a 200-pound cop landed one in your eye. Not exactly a gentlemanly thing to do. Nor is kneeing him a ladylike thing to do. He deserved it. He was gonna tow away my car-- you're lucky that 50 bought him off and he didn't haul you in. You know, you never really told me why you gave him the money. I was having my first major opening. I had to do something to get that unsightly pile of junk you called your car away from the front of my gallery. Shiner and all, you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I was a mess! I was a street girl, barely 17. What did I know? I was just struggling to survive. You were so young and naive. All you talked about was one day you were gonna show 'em all. And I did. I showed 'em all. You're still the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, lillith. I wish you hadn't stopped smoking. I don't understand why you keep trying to quit. You never succeed. Failure is what brings you back to reality. Charlie, sell before the end of business today-- trust me. Good morning. Good morning. I shouldn't. You asked me not to. Just our secret. Yes, ma'am. China?yes? Make sure that Eddie brings US those big strawberries, not the little ones like he brought US last time. Yes, ma'am. Anything else? No. Hi. Come in. This is some place you got here. Um, I hope you don't mind, but I couldn't sleep, so I showed myself the house. Did you have breakfast?Yes. Your maid made me something. She's very nice. She's wonderful. Do you live in this big house all alone? Except when I have a guest such as yourself. Oh! Well, I'll be out of here today. Are you going back home to Nebraska? No. Uh, there's no one left for me there. But I don't want to be a burden to you. Don't worry about it. You're welcome to stay here until you decide what you want to do. Thank you. But why are you being so nice to me? I guess I have a soft spot for girls who have no place to go. Lil: Harvey's been a dear friend of mine for a long time. How long have you known each other? I'm sure he's explained to you how I like to work. Was there anything particular that you had in mind, any physical type you prefer? Uh-huh. What about temperament? Do you prefer someone more aggressive, or on the submissive side? I have someone in mind who is... Quite exceptional. I'm sure you'll be very satisfied. The fee is a thousand. My girls deserve it. They're the best. Mr. Wilson, my business rests on my reputation. If you are not happy, I want to be the first to know about it. I don't think you two have met. Wendy, this is Julie. Hi.hi. Nice to meet you. What happened to you? Oh. It's a long story. Aren't they all? Wendy. Come on over. It arrived this morning.Did he call? About an hour ago. He's very anxious to see you. I have mid-terms. You promised. Open it! Let's see what you've got. This is exciting! Oh, it's incredible. Must have cost a fortune. Hopefully enough to pay for law school next year. It's one of the best I've seen. What did he want? New York. He wants you there on Thursday. I have mid-terms next week. I've gotta study! Wendy. Wendy! Look, you know how crazy he is about you. He just spent a small fortune on that necklace. What do you want me to do-- send it back with a note, "sorry, Wendy has mid-terms"? But he was supposed to be in Europe with his wife. I guess he had a change in plans. I suggest you change yours. He wants you there Thursday. I'm gonna call Maurice, see if he can fit you in. You're in desperate need of a trim. Lil... You don't understand. If I don't study, I'll flunk, and I'm already on probation. I can't! You'll have plenty of time to study on the plane. He only wants you there for two days. You're very important to len, Wendy. But I just saw him!Your priorities are wrong. Let's not forget who's paying the bills. Incredible. I--I've never seen anything like it. Tiffany's is full of them. Very expensive-looking. He must be very rich. Where have you been? Julie, this town if full of guys who get turned on going into Tiffany's and spending 10,000 on something like this. But he must like you a lot. Yes. It's one of the perks of the job. A little show of their appreciation and loyalty. But why? The most vulnerable man is the one with power and money, that's why. When he buys the best, he feels safe, secure. If he feels you're loyal, he'll buy you the world. And that's the trick-- to make him feel your loyalty. Understand? Yeah. [ Dance music plays ] Trainer: Five, six, seven, eight! [ Music stops ] Okay. Would you please stay and would you please stay? Ladies, thank you very much. Next group of dancers, please!

I even got three job offers. A waitress, a cashier, and a salesgirl. Well, that's great! Which one are you gonna take? Well, I know this is gonna sound kind of pushy... I was just thinking that-- I mean, I've seen what you've done for girls like Wendy and April, and i'd-- well, I know I'm not as pretty as they are, but I was just wondering-- you'd like to work for me? Yeah. Do you have any idea what it's all about? Well, I know what you do, and I know what Wendy and April do, and I think I can do it. You do? You think you can handle it? Well, i--I've been with men before. If you work for me... You live by my rules. You look the way I want you to look, you act the way I tell you to act. It's not fun and games. I'm rough on my girls. But I don't take just anyone-- all my girls are special. You have to be sure... That this is really what you want to do. I'm positive. Okay. You'll be seeing a friend of mine tonight. He'll give me an evaluation. You mean I have to audition for you? Yes. Ifi pass... Do I start working? No. Then the hard work begins. The reason men pay the most for my girls is not what they do in bed, it's what they do beforethey get to bed. Before? When we're finished, you'll be able to talk to a senator, a prince, a movie star, an ambassador, and all of them will believe you have a degree from Radcliffe. I don't know if I can do that.

I'd like to go to the hotel first to freshen up. He specifically requested that you come straight to the office. Drilling was supposed to start three weeks ago. What the hell's going on? Well, we got a telex from 'em this morning confirming that our off-shore drilling leases-- they were approved two weeks ago. What's holding 'em up?! They claim to have had some trouble with the property owners. I don't buy that. I want some answers. I'll be there in the morning. How soon can our boys in Houston get those rigs shipped out? Most of the equipment is already on the dock ready to be loaded. They've just been waiting for our go-ahead. Sam-- you follow it up. Wendy: Miss me, darling? My god... What happened to you? Steven found out. How? That party senator Allen gave last year. His uncle was there, and I was with him. Where have you been? [ Crying ] I don't know! I don't know, I don't know, I don't know... [ Sobbing ] Shh... God, I really loved him! You know, I thought that he was different, I thought that I could start over with him and Bury my past and I could go back to before. You can't. You can't go back. People don't go back-- they go forward or they stand still. They don't go back. And you can't ever forget who you were. No man will let you. Ohh, lil! Culver: You're the only one that really understands me. Elaine wants me to go out every night. That's probably why she wants me to run for governor. I think you'll make a wonderfulgovernor. These boys want to buy me. Like they want to buy everybody. I thought politics is what you want. What I want is you. If I decide to run for office... You're something I'm gonna have to give up. And that's the last thing I intend on doing. [ Phone rings ] [ Ringing ] Hello? Oh. Hello, Elaine. I must have fallen asleep. What did the doctor say about Josh's cold? An allergy?

A book on wine, a gourmet cookbook, and two current best-sellers. Start with these. I'm having a small dinner party this evening. Ambassador Farnsworth, will be here. I'd like you to be there. An ambassador? What do I say? Learning how to be a good listener is they key to being successful. You have to make him feel that you're interested in him. Ask him questions. What kind of questions? There's an article on the ambassador in this magazine. Study it. If a man trusts you, he'll tell you his innermost fears and secrets, things he can't tell anybody else-- not even his wife or his best friend. Then why would he tell me? Because you're going to allow him to feel vulnerable with you. What should I wear? It's up to you. But lil! [ Dinner guests conversing ] Julie: It sounds fascinating. Have you been doing it for a long time? Ambassador: For a couple of years now, but it's gonna take a long time to get it really humming. [ Conversations continue ] Our constitution says that a man is innocent until proven guilty. You've had such a fascinating life-- meeting all those people and living all over the world. Unbelievable! It's nice of you to say so. I consider myself very fortunate. I've managed to be in the right place at the right time and have the right connections. So everything in my life has really gone like clockwork. You've had enough to drink. I just had one glass of champagne. I stopped counting after the fourth. I thought you were quitting. I am. I'm just having a good time. Enjoying your hospitality. [ Gagging ] [ Retching ][ Toilet flushes ] Sorry, I just... I just couldn't do it. Lil: The last ten years of Picasso's life were his most prolific. Some people think his earlier works were his best. The blue period? What do you think? Well, I'm not sure, but I think I like his later work better. Why? Because it looks like a kid did it. And I'm sure when they see the price, they'll think their kid can do it. You've studied hard. Never thought I'd like it. Good to see you.How's the campaign? Terrific. You know my wife.Hello. Sharon, how are you? Julie Tyler. Senator and Mrs. Wells. Hi. It's nice to meet you. Julie, it's a pleasure. Wife: I sent you an invitation to the charity ball for the children's foundation. The 21st. I'll be there. Nice meeting you.Nice meeting you. He liked you. How can you tell? I've known the senator for many years. One look tells me all I need to know. But his wife was standing right there. Sometimes I forget how young and naive you are. Men like the senator, high profile men, have a lot to lose if they're seen with a working girl. That's why I'm so successful. Who does his wife think you are? A wealthy divorce. She's probably suggesting to the senator that they fix you up with their son. Discretion-- that's what they pay for. And my reputation is only as good as the girls working for me. It's a small town, Julie. One act of indiscretion spreads through this town like the latest rumor of who's running a studio. Lil, I know you think I'm young and naive, but I'm not stupid. If I thought you were stupid, you wouldn't be working for me. Lil! Oh! Tomorrow morning a limousine will pick you up at 9:00. A limousine... I've never been in a limousine. The car will pick you up at 9:00. In the morning. You'll be driven to the airport where a private lear jet will be waiting for you. You'll be flown to acapulco where a driver and limo will be waiting. They'll take you to the harbor where a speedboat will take you to a private yacht. Your host for the next four days will be Peter danner. He's been a devoted client of mine for years. He's hired you for his son Justin who's just turned 18 and is still a virgin. You'll be his first... And Peter wants it to be very special. Lil wasn't kidding. You are something special. He's young and he's sensitive-- be gentle with him. Julie, I'd like you to meet my wife Terry and my son Justin. Julie's the niece of my east coast rep. Hi. Hi. Danner: Justin, why don't you show Julie her room? Uh... Well, go ahead, Justin. Her room's the one next to yours. Okay. Is this your dad's?Yeah. It's unbelievable. Yeah, it's--it's okay. You must think I'm a real country bumpkin, but I've never seen anyplace like this before. Well, except for in magazines. Oh! This is the most beautiful place in the world! Yeah, it's okay. You've probably been here so many times it doesn't matter to you. How old are you? Uh, twenty-three. No, you're not. I can tell when people lie. I'll...be nineteen next month. Why? I'm just curious. Uh... Uh, why don't you get changed into something more comfortable, and, uh, unpack and everything, and, um, I'll meet you up on deck, okay? You're what? Seven weeks pregnant. I saw Dr. Davis this morning. How could anyone as smart as you get pregnant? I don't know, lil. It was an accident. I didn't plan this. How could you be so stupid?

Maybe I am having one too many. If you can give up the booze... I'll give you another chance. I will. I promise. One more slip-up... And I never want to see you again. I won't disappoint you, lil, I promise. Oh, a friend of senator Wells called. He's coming in tomorrow. He's heard a lot about my girls-- wants the best. I thought Wells was Wendy's. I'm pulling her for a while. She's studying too hard... Flaking out on me. So, who is he? I'm checking him out. I'll give you all the details tomorrow night. Interested? Yeah. If you want me to, of course, lil. Julie, I love you. I can't live without you. You hardly know me. You don't know anything about me. I don't care. I love you. I can't live without you. Julie, I want you to marry me. But what about your father? He doesn't know what love is. Besides, I don't care what he thinks, I love you. And I think you love me too, don't you? Yes. Yes, I love you. Len culver, please. Intercom: Wendy on line two. How are ya, sugar? Wendy: I'm sorry to bother you, darling. Bother me? We're beyond that aren't we, Wendy? You know I'm always here for you. Listen, I, uh-- if it's about Vegas, I understand if you can't come on Monday. I know it's short notice. Len, I'm pregnant! You want money? Is that why you're calling? No... Of course not. Len, I'm calling to tell you that I'm going to have your child. How do I know that? As far as I know, I'm only one of many in your life. You're the only one I see. How much do you want, Wendy? Len... I'm not calling you about money, don't you understand that? Then why are you? I don't know! I-- I guess it was a mistake. How could you be so stupid? Do you have some fantasy that len culver loves you and he cares that you're having his baby? Ifit's his. You don't know that for sure, do you? I know it's his. And he has a right to know. He doesn't want to know. As far as len culver is concerned, you and this baby don't exist. I see. The furs, the jewelry, the declarations of love... You're smart enough not to fall for the lines. Well, I tried, but you did such a wonderful job convincing me that I was someone special to len culver-- what you have forgotten, Wendy, is that this is business. Len culver boughtyou. He paid a price and got what he wanted-- a high-class prostitute. You can't forget what you are-- I haven't. That's why I'm so successful. No. Let's get to the bottom line, shall we? The reason you're here today is because you're afraid you're gonna lose your best girl. I'm pregnant, and if I stay pregnant, I can't work. Right, lil? Say you lose me... And maybe len, too. Tsk tsk tsk tsk. Unless... Unless you have someone else to replace me. Yeah. Maybe Julie. She's a nice, young nymphet. Do you think you can make her as good as me, lil? Oh, you are so cold. Len, um... ...wanted you to have this. It's 50,000. I don't want his money. If you're dumb enough to have the kid... Be smart enough to at least give it something. Lil! Are you all right? Sure. Come on in. How was it? Oh, it was wonderful! It was the most beautiful place in the world. I thought you'd have a good time. Peter called. He said you were great. He even, uh... Sent you something extra. I think you'll be pleased. I--i don't want the money. That's what this is all about, Julie. Justin loves me! He wants to marry me. He's a boy. You were the first women he was with. Of course he's gonna say he loves you. He does! You don't understand. I understand, Julie. I've been there. I made the mistake once, I believed him. Ha! I even thought he loved me. That he would take me out of this life. But men don't marry prostitutes, Julie. You're wrong. Justin loves me, and he wants to marry me. [ Door closes ] That'll be $5.50. Can you wait until I see if he's there? Okay, but the meter's running. Okay. [ Doorbell rings ] I've already paid lil. What are you doing here? I want to see Justin.He isn't home. Well, when will he be home? For you, never. But we had a date! Look, I don't know what kind of a game you're trying to pull, but my son doesn't date whores. Why don't you just be a good little girl and get lost? [ Voices in distance ] Man: Just punch it. That's it. Get the racket out in front. Punch it. Just punch it. There you go, there we go. That's good. Punch it out in front of you. Good. Keep your racket head above your wrist. You're dropping your racket head, that was too low... Boy: Is that her? Yeah. Man, she's gorgeous. I can't believe your old man. I'd give anything to have a father like him. Yeah, he's a heckuva guy. What do you think he had to pay for her? Do you think i--will you shut up? Sorry. [ Dance music plays ] [ Phone rings ] Yeah? Hey, April. It's Claudia. This is a surprise. Honey, can you do me a big favor? Can you fill in for me tonight? I'm a little under the weather. Sure. I can use the bread. Great. It's 7566 oakridge. Be there at eight. What's his name? I don't know, but he's a very good friend of senator Wells. Sure, why not? Don't be late. I won't. Will you have him call that number as soon as possible? Thank you. I'm leaving. You're what? I said I was leaving. Look, it happens to all of US. All working girls fall in love once in a while. You'll get over it. I don't want to get over it. I don't want to make love to a man for four days and come away with nothing. You made $5,000. I don't call that nothing. I mean nothing inside! I feel like I don't exist, that I don't count! Like he made love to someone else, and he fell in love with them... Only I wasn't even there! Look, you'll-- you'll get used to it. You'll toughen up. No. It's too big a price. And for what? So I can wear fancy clothes and ride around in a limousine, go on fancy yachts? You left the farm in Nebraska. You don't want to be a cashier, a waitress-- I'd rather be a waitress! Or a farmer, or even a street hooker! At least they don't pretend to fall in love with you. You're a piece of meat. For five bucks or five thousand, there's no difference. And you still feel like nothing inside. This should cover some of your investment. It's your money. You earned it. I don't want it. Somehow not taking the money makes it a lot easier to live with. Hi. Hi. We've been lookin' forward to this. [ Phone rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Hello? Man: Lil? Douglas? What time is it? Just past one. Lil, I'm watching the late news, and a girl was killed in a house on oakridge. TV: This is what we have so far. Around midnight, neighbors in this quiet hillside community heard a woman scream for help. Oh, no. When police arrived at this rented house on oakridge, they found the body of a young woman. Oh, my god. ...could not determine immediately the cause of death. I never checked him out. He used Wells' name, I thought it was all right. You never checked him out? I tried-- Wells was gone. He never got back to me. Oh, my god. ...when he found the victim, she was nude, lying in the empty living room, bound and gagged. The police say they cannot confirm her identity, but it seems they have some evidence that leads them to suspect that she might be a high-class prostitute... [ TV off ] She was a mess. It was not Claudia-- it was April. April? No! I sent Claudia! How dareshe? Why didn't she call me like she was supposed to? All my girls know my rules! Claudia's been flaky... I should never have taken her back! But what about April? Doesn't it matter to you she's lying in that morgue? It's part of the job. It's a risk a girl takes every time she walks in a room with a stranger. I thought you protected them. That's why you have this... Great reputation. "Had." Once the word's on the street that April was one of my girls, my business is over. No one will ever trust me again. Is your reputation the only thing you care about? It's all I have. You have money. What more do you want? I don't know. I don't know what I want. I don't know who I am anymore. Hold me--I'm scared! I...did love you. No, you didn't. Yes, I did. What did you know about love? Nothing. But you even less. You were too busy hating yourself to believe anyone could love you. Would you have married me? I already know the answer. She insisted that you wouldn't mind. Claudia. I came by to show you my new car. I figured if I was gonna be a class act, I should drive a classy car. What happened tonight, Claudia? I wasn't feeling well, so I called April to fill in. I thought she was smart enough to handle it. Why didn't you call me? I don't know. I just decided to take care of it myself. I didn't think it was any big deal. I think you've had enough, Claudia. I've just begun. See, you have to drink enough so that whatever feeling there is goes away. You know that feeling, don't you, lil? It's kind of a cold numbness where nothing matters. You know my rules. You know the way I operate. Well, maybe I didn't feel like following them! April is dead because of you! Me? You're the one who messed up, not me! It's your fault that April's dead! And it could have been me! You're losing it! You're not as careful as you used to be! You used to protect your girls! You never sent US out unless you carefully checked the guy out. It's over, lil. Feelings? Another flaw in the great lil hutton. Whores don't have feelings, lil! That's what we give up when we sell ourselves! That's why they pay US the big money. Money wasn't the only thing I wanted. [ Phone rings ] Money is all it's about. That's all this is about! [ Ringing ]No! Answer it. What's wrong? You can't take it anymore? Is the business too tough for you? Go ahead-- answer it! [ Ringing ] You answer it, Claudia. Answer it! You want to be the new Beverly Hills madam... You want to be me... You want to make the big money, drive the fancy cars, wear the expensive clothes... Go ahead. Answer it, Claudia! [ Ringing ] Oh, it's easy. Whores don't have feelings. No, all you have to do is take some girls from the street, give 'em a little class, and sell them. Like I sold you. You can have it all, Claudia. But you've gonna have to do it on your own, like I did. [ Phone ringing ] [ Ringing ] [ Ringing] Claudia: Hello? No, this isn't lil. But I can take care of it. What kind of girl did you have in mind? I have someone I think you'll like, she's quite exceptional. Oh, I'm sure you'll be very satisfied. My fee is a thousand. Of course, my girls deserve it-- they're the best.
