They say that girlfriends from MBBS don't last till post-graduation. Richa seems to be on the same path. What is it now? Being liberal is a total sham, okay? I'm a liberal as well. Genuine, real, concentrated-type liberal. I've never indulged in those douchebro antics. "That girl belongs to me." Nope. Anytime I ask her where she is, she's with Vishal. "Whom are you talking to?" Vishal. "Whose message is it?" Vishal's. So, I asked her if she was in love with Vishal… and she was pissed! She said, "You're stuck in the '90s. Can't a girl and a guy just be friends?" What kind of friendship is this? She has a problem studying with her own boyfriend. She says, "You get too competitive!" We're preparing for a competitive exam, of course, I'll be competitive. And why does she study with Vishal? Because he's incompetent? They gossip all night over cups of tea. She rests her head on his shoulder. It's too much. How do you know? Know what? That she rests her head on his shoulder? I crashed their little study party a few times… armed with a thermos of tea. She did it right in front of me. Then? Bro, I don't get this concept. I just don't get it at all. -What concept? -She enjoys talking to Vishal, she enjoys watching movies with him, she enjoys studying with him, then she might as well have sex with him! Bro, I also enjoy talking to you, watching movies with you, and chilling with you… but the thought of having sex with you… has never crossed my mind! I know what the problem is. -It's that-- -What rank did Richa get? 224. And you? 655. That's the problem. Man, if I just get Ortho somehow… I swear even I'll cozy up to Vishal, then! Come on, let's get you that Ortho seat! There are no Ortho seats available in Bhopal. -Indore? -No. -Gwalior? -No. Mandsaur! You can get Ortho only in Mandsaur. It's a ghost town. Ghosts don't break bones. Sir, please try and find me a seat in Bhopal. Indore, at most. My mother has no one but me. I can't leave her alone. You're lucky, son. -I found a seat. -Where, sir? Bhopal. There's a vacant seat. In which college? Bhopal Institute of Medical Sciences. What are you saying, sir?! It's a top college! Get me in, please! Gynecology. I can't take Gynae. Sir, I'm sure you can pull some strings. Please find me a seat in Bhopal. There's this roll number, Priyanka Singh. She's got Ortho. If she agrees, you can swap seats with her. Got it, sir. Thank you, sir. What did you get? Gynecology. Shut up! Look, that's Priyanka Singh. She's got Ortho. I know her. I need to swap with her. Sure. Sounds like a plan. But how should I convince her? Just tell her that… you can't take Gynae, but she can. What if she asks why? Then say, "How can I treat body parts I don't have?" Will you clear your civil services exam by spouting such nonsense? Do you have a better argument? Obviously! Then go for it! -It's-- -Hi. Priyanka Singh? -Yes? -I met you with Richa, remember? She's my girlfriend. Oh, yes! The thing is, studying Ortho was my childhood dream. And you got Ortho! It was my dream as well. I got Gynae. Wow! Are you making fun of me? No. Why don't we swap? You take Gynae, I'll take Ortho. -What? -Yeah! -No… -Listen to me. I have a good argument. Look, Richa and I are going to get married. I had promised her that I'll take Ortho, she can take ophthalmology, and we'll run a clinic together. We have big plans after marriage. Don't get us divorced before we're married. Hold on a minute. You guys are breaking up. Whom are you trying to fool? The entire girls' hostel knows it. And what kind of clinic do an eye surgeon and an orthopedic surgeon run together? Wait a minute, what are we even talking about? Gynae or Ortho, take whatever you want! -Why are you after my life? -Just take Gynae, for God's sake! -You can take it, I can't! -Why? How can I treat body parts I don't have? I don't believe this. I won't study Gynae. Be grateful you don't have to study poop and piss. It's called Pathology! Yes, what if you had gotten that? No way that could happen, Auntie. I made him sign up for Gynae. Really? Thank you! Here, have it. I'm having watermelon, and you're stuffing my mouth with laddoos! You made them for yourself, you have them! What do you mean? You're the one who craves them. Why are you force-feeding me? No matter whom I made them for, it took lots of hard work. An hour and a half to prepare the khoya. Then, grind the dry fruits. Hours to knead the dough and roll it into balls, one by one. And finally, they were done. Not a single laddoo is round. No matter what shape it is, a ghee laddoo still tastes as sweet. -There's a vital lesson here. -And what's what? That being a doctor is like being a ghee laddoo. Whether you fix bones or examine poop, a doctor is a doctor! Mom, poop-- Here, have one. When I win Kitchen Captain on TV, you'll proudly go around college and say, "There's magic in my mother's hands!" Dude, you're lucky to be getting postgrad admission. So, just take it. And then, what will I do? Do you see my situation? It's been three years, I'm still struggling to clear my civil services prelims. Listen, can I pay the rent next month? Shut up! Okay. -Hello. -Yeah, Richa! -I want to talk to you. -Okay. Can we meet tomorrow if you're free? -Sure, let's meet tomorrow. -Cool. Okay, bye. Point 1: You have no problem with Vishal. Point 2: Don't even think of having sex. Point 3: Keep saying sorry every few minutes. Her Majesty's 25 minutes late. I bet she won't say sorry. Sorry, I got late. Hi! No, it's cool! You told Priyanka that we're planning to get married, have two kids, run a hospital-- -I didn't say anything about kids. -Dude, whatever! I don't want kids. -I don't even want to get married. -No. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Look, it's too late now. Let me complete. Vishal and you are just friends. I understand it. I'm fine with it. I get it. I mean, he's such a nice boy. He even got such a good rank. I'm not even talking about Vishal! That's not an issue. What is the issue then? You suffocate me. -Me? -Yes! You ask me about everything, every text, every conversation I'm having. It feels like I'm under a criminal inquiry. You even turned up at Vishal's place uninvited with a tea thermos! So, it is about Vishal, actually! Uday, you're not listening to me! You know what… I think you just can't hear women. Maybe women are like bats to you, who talk at some other frequency. What kind of strange logic is that? Man… I am done. I need to go. Take care of yourself. Do you love me? I love you. I love you a lot. You want breakup sex? Sure, we could… Wow. You're such a… And you think you love me?! Didn't you tell Priyanka… that you can't treat body parts you don't have? You clearly have no spine! How can you be an orthopedic surgeon? Idiot! I don't care if I have to hang upside down all my life… I want Ortho, that's it! You're not a kid, Uday! What do you mean you won't join? You want to drop another year? So, what should I do, brother? Remember when you fractured your hand in high school? Excuse me, sir, Miss Kavya is here. Yeah, send her in. Come on. Take it easy. -Hi! -Hi! Uday, this is Kavya, my friend. That's my brother. He's an MBBS. He's doing his post-graduation… in Gynae. But I'm preparing for my post-graduation again. I want… Ortho, like my brother. I've taken up Biology in my final school year. I'm prepping for my pre-medical exam. But why don't you want to do Gynae? Because Gynae is for girls. She's too ambitious. She's already planning her post-graduation. Clear your pre-medical exam first. One minute. For you. Man, I'm so hooked on her. It's like an adventure. Isn't she a little young, brother? She's almost 18! And she might look tiny, but she's got some big demands. -Ashok! -Yeah? -It's very nice! Thank you so much! -It is, right? You know, if I'd got Gynae for my post-graduation, I'd have grabbed it with my both hands! Brother, you mentioned the time I fractured my hand in high school? Oh, yes! Kavya, listen to this. It'll inspire you for your exams. Uday once fractured his hand in high school. You know what he said when I was plastering his hand? "The exams are three months away. I'll ace them even with my left hand." I was so floored by your attitude! You know, Kavya, he's never let me down. It's time you fight and prove yourself again. There's lots of time left. You're some 10-12 days late in joining, right? Look… keep your seat in Gynae. Take home 50,000 every month, and prepare for the next year alongside. -Alright. -Okay? Multitasking. Like Kavya does it, right? Next year, both my champs are going to kill it. One in her pre-medical exam, and the other in his post-graduation! Yes, brother. Okay, bye. Everybody says I'm a fool Such optimism is not cool Guddu! -When they think the story's done -You forgot this. -Listen. -I say, we've only begun Begun We've only begun Begun At hope, I'm a pro I'm an idiot optimist, bro I think like a straight arrow I'm an idiot optimist, bro That's right! -At hope, I'm a pro -Is the classroom this way? -Yes. -I'm an idiot optimist, bro Idiot Idiot optimist Whether it's Tuesday or Thursday, half-moon or full moon… it doesn't affect the sex of the child! Whether you do it toward the east or west… there's no guarantee of it being a boy or a girl! Ma'am… -I'm joining today. -Labor room one. Go out, walk straight, and take a left. Yes. No, I wasn't talking to you. Labor room? The delivery's in progress, you're late! Weren't you told to come at 9:00? At hope, I'm a pro I'm an idiot optimist, bro I think like a straight arrow I'm an idiot optimist, bro Idiot Annie, she's full, -pass me the suction cup quickly! -Yes, ma'am. Looks like fetal distress. Hello, why are you here? -Ma'am, actually-- -What? Were you invited? -Do you see any man around here? -Just get out! -I'm Dr. Uday, first-year PG. -So? Does this look like the freshers' party? Get out! -Please… -Get out! Calm down. Out! -Leave, for God's sake! -Call pediatrics, and inform the family. Ma'am, please calm down! -Idiot -Only when it grows in number… that is when it causes a vaginal infection, vaginitis. And we've seen how fungus grows on damp walls or trees. -Why? Because of moisture. -Moisture. So, what better place for these rogues to party than our vaginas? Hey, look. Hello, ma'am. Dr. Uday Gupta. First year. You're ten days late. Shall I roll out a red carpet? Come in. Fresh meat in the house! Lamb to the slaughter! Okay, fungus. Let's take a look at this vagina. Uday-0, Gynecology Department-1. OPD, OT, labor room… they've put me on duty everywhere. Do they take me for a chump? -Bloody hell-- -What? What's this rubbish? I smacked your head, not your ass! Why would you even do that? What's wrong with you? If I complain to Dean, you'll be thrown out of college. Then you can sit at home browsing matrimonial sites! Hey, smartass! Lower both your eyes and voice, got it? -Don't get too excited. -Why? -You're a junior, behave like one! -Okay! -What's going on? -Ma'am, look at her. She's misbehaving, asking me to lower my eyes. Then, lower them! Senior! If she tells you to give a patient an enema and wash their poop… you'll have to do it! Senior! So, now, lower your eyes! Hey, third button! You… meet me in the storeroom. -So much attitude! -Oh, my! -Too big for his boots! -Oh God, he is so arrogant! What's your name? Uday. Wrong answer! Your name is Little Lamb. Okay. All the boys that come to this department… our big mama, Nandini ma'am, turns them into sacrificial lambs. Okay. Very Good. Drop that attitude, son. You've been called here for your own good. We had this batchmate… what was his name? -Prashant. -Prashant Rastogi! Thanks to Nandini ma'am, he left the department in four months flat! He's just been sitting at home and vegetating since last year. So, did you hit my head so I could absorb this wisdom? It was a harmless joke. If a guy had done it, you wouldn't have got so worked up! Fine, let it all out. Why don't you smack my head-- Actually, wait. You… spank me. -Wow! -Spank?! Yeah, spank! Whatever your senior says, do it without question! So, spank her, or you'll be slaughtered! -Do it! -Come on! -Spank! -Spank! -Come on, spank! -Do it! Come on! -I-- -Listen, I went to a matrimonial site to look for a guy… but I couldn't find anyone. So, why don't you get your ass on that bed? -Come on! -Best! Wear this. It'll be easier to spread your legs. Come on! -Well done! That's like a good boy! -Nice! -Why are you doing this to me, guys? -Come on. Seriously? Please… I want another baby girl. I want to make her a wrestler. After all, our girls are no less than boys! Maybe she'll win India another gold medal! Yes! Come on, scream your lungs out! How else will the baby come out? -Push! -Push, Mr. Gupta! Come on! Is that how you do it? Come on! -I can see the head! -Yes, come on! Push! It's a beautiful baby girl, Mr. Gupta! Same bushy eyebrows! Uday-0, Gynecology Department-Sixer. …it's only in the pulmonary veins. Everywhere else there is bad blood. I said, "Manav, if you keep shouting to win an argument, then, for sure, there will be bad blood between us!" What's the matter, bro? Those women really took my case today! And you let them?! They're my seniors. What could I do? It's not like you'll be in there forever. You'll take your exam next year and leave. You should have given it back to them! This is your problem. You pent up your anger. Why don't you take all this simmering anger… and let it all out tomorrow? Why wait till tomorrow? Then? I'll let it out right away. Whom are you calling? Richa! Hello, Uday? Sleeping soundly, aren't you? -Uday, what happened to you? -Put it on speakerphone. Are you okay? Having a gala time? What nonsense! I'm in the department. So, you think I can't hear you? That I don't understand women? Thanks to you, I'll be bossed over by women all my life! Because of me?! Yes. You know why? Because I screwed up my rank, thanks to you! What? You wasted all my time and got a good rank yourself! Are you drunk? I'm hanging up. You screwed up my rank and ruined my career! Uday, this is the last time we're talking. Don't call me again, or I'll go to the cops. Do what you want! Well done! Feel lighter now? Now, start preparing tomorrow. Put in a leave application, and sit at home. -Namaste, doctor. -Namaste. -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. Ma'am, the patient's file. How are you feeling, Shantidevi? I'm alright. Who will tell me this patient's prognosis? Ma'am-- You. Ma'am, me? Yes, Last Man Standing. You. Ma'am, it really depends… On what? On the condition of the patient, I guess. Why don't we just ask her! -So, Shantidevi… -Yes? what would you like, C-section or a normal delivery? Ma'am, urine is showing Grade 3 protein. This is the patient's third trimester, and the blood pressure count is 140/100. There are chances of preeclampsia, so definitely, ma'am, C-section. Good. You'll assist on this case. And you, meet me after my rounds. He's dead meat! Why are you here? Because you called me, ma'am. No… I mean, why are you in the gynecology department? Oh. Because it is… interesting. It's not a hobby class. BSDM. Rank 655. I'm seeing someone with a rank below 500 in this department for the first time! I don't want any student who's here just to kill time. Ma'am, actually, I'm a good student. The thing is-- I don't want to know. And it's important for a doctor to look like one. We need doctors here, not wannabe rock stars. You have a lot to catch up on. Just remember, -in my class-- -My mother is very unwell. She needs urgent treatment in Delhi. I need a few days' leave. -What happened? -Heart… condition. There's a coronary artery problem. Unstable angina. Then, why Delhi? You could admit her to this hospital. Dr. Parihar is a very good cardiologist. I'll personally get her checkup done. You can leave. Thank you, ma'am. Damn, this really backfired! BOOMERANG Why are you so fixated on Ortho, bro? You know, in tenth grade, I fell from my bicycle before my pre-board exams. My right hand was fractured. I somehow scraped through the pre-boards with my left hand. But if I had to take my board exams like that, I'd be pulling a vegetable cart today! That distant cousin of mine… Ashok… the orthopedician. He's the one who treated me. He said to me, "Well done! You worked hard and managed to pass your pre-boards. But I promise you, you'll write your board exams with your right hand." I scored 92%. Ashok was the reason I decided… to opt for Biology in school and become an orthopedic surgeon. I scored 66% in my board exams. My father told me, "You'd better do BSc. You won't pass the pre-medical exam." I joined BSc… and spent the whole time preparing for medical. But I couldn't make it. Now, I'm preparing for civil services. I'm just telling you this in general. There's no great life lesson in my story. Bro, can you please talk to your mother about the rent-- Shut up! Please do it for me. If there are cuts made during delivery, then they have to be repaired immediately. -With no-- -Doctor… I'm really scared of needles. What? You're scared of such a tiny needle?! What about when your husband gave you his big injection? Weren't you scared then? The dilatation measurement is wrong. Basics, Dr. Gupta, basics! Idiot Check her! -Shit! -Idiot Hey, idiot Oh, idiot Hey, idiot Oh, idiot Oh! Planning to climb to the top of the leaderboard? No, I'm planning to sink right to the bottom… so that I have no work anymore. Like a vestigial organ in the human body? Like your nipples. Why do they exist? Actually, we should call him Dr. Nipples! I love that! -Dr. Nipples! -Dr. Nipples! Hi, I'm Dr. Fatima, and that's KLPD. Please, don't even try to decode it. Of course not! Though, I suspect it could be, "Killer Lady, Pregnant Dragon!" Nice! KLPD… Kumudlatha Pamulparti Divakaran. By the way, I'm glad you didn't take any of our ribbing seriously. No, not at all. Three on a bike with this?! Mr. Nipples, a woman in Raipur just had five babies, and you're worried about three on a bike?! Listen, don't try any shady stunts, okay? Fatima's already engaged. I'm an idiot optimist, bro The cancer department isn't run by crabs, right? Then, why must the gynecology department be ruled over by women? There's "guy" in gynaec, after all! You do have a point, bro! Your department needs a makeover. What? Auntie, your hair looks great! -Thank you. -It looks the same to me. By the way, how's your girlfriend? What girlfriend? Richa! I saw your pictures on Facebook. Chaddi had commented on it, "You guys are playing doctor-doctor!" She's not my girlfriend. I know what "playing doctor-doctor" means. It's okay if you've broken up. You'll find another girl! You should download Tinder! What? Tinder is this thing… people meet on it. Where are you learning all this? Do you even know what women on Tinder are like? Just like the men on it, I suppose! Fine, Mom. Go ahead and download Tinder. Upload my pictures, and find me a girl. Okay? Auntie… And Mister Naked Fakir, pay your rent! Ask him for the rent! -I've downloaded Tinder! -Great! At least, check out the photo! I have the freshers' party to attend. I've uploaded my picture… Dr. Nipples! Why are you standing here like a vestigial organ? At least, be useful here! I don't know how to dance. Why are you bothering him? We have the whole year to make him dance to our tunes. You stay put here. You'll get uncomfortable out there. Fatima, come on. Let's get you some dance practice before your engagement. Let's go! Come! Hello, sir. How's it going? Want me to change the music? Shahjahan, this Prashant Rastogi… did he find admission elsewhere, or did he really get screwed? He got pretty screwed, sir. I'm probably the only man here who has survived this long. Most guys would run away. What's this romance going on between you and Jenny? She's holding a grudge just because she's a senior. I fear she actually might slaughter me. Can't you patch us up? How can I do that? Just say sorry to her! It's so awkward, man, saying sorry and all. You know what I mean. Just say sorry, and it won't be awkward anymore. Simple. Hey, come. -Hi! -Hi. This is Aarif, my fiance. Aarif, that's Uday, my junior. In Gynae? Bye! Let's go. Poor guy! Did he choose Gynae himself? Look, the doctor's here. -Scream loudly, come on. -Sunita, what's her status? Or he'll take her for delivery before you! Come on, scream! Oh, God! Mom, it hurts! It hurts so bad! Scream loudly, or the doctor will attend to her first! Mom, I'm in pain! -Mom! -Mom! -I'm in pain! -I'm in pain! Oh, God! -Oh, God! -Oh, God! -Louder! -You can do it! -Mom, it hurts! -Mom, it hurts so much! -Oh, God! -Oh, God! Mom! Sunita, give her petocin. I'll come in a bit. Jenny, please help me. Check her dilatation, please? I wish I could help you, but I don't have time. I need to create a profile on that matrimonial site. It hurts! Sunita, help me out. Check them, please. Mom, it hurts! Mom! -Oh, God! -Oh, God! Move. The baby will arrive only when the passage opens up. Screaming will expand your vocal cords, not your cervix! What are you staring at him for? It's of no use. He's not even a doctor. Data entry! Good morning, ma'am. Good afternoon. What's the issue? -Knee-pain… -One minute. Dr. Nandini has called you to the OT. Me? No… that lady in the green sari. Yes, tell me. -Hello, ma'am. -Hello. Ma'am… Dr. Shukla, tell him what procedure we're performing today. Dilatation and Curettage. D&C. And what is its purpose? D-- Ma'am, D&C is used for abortion. What's the difference between you and a ward boy? D&C is used for diagnostic purposes. D&E is conducted for abortion. Studying Ortho won't teach you this, will it? You'll take the entrance exam for Ortho again next year. You've just reserved your seat here for safety. Why? -Ma'am, because-- -No. Why don't you want to study Gynecology? Ma'am, male gynecologists don't do well. People always prefer female doctors. What's this male-female nonsense? A doctor is a doctor. -Patients don't have that mindset. -Change your mindset first! You have to lose the male touch. And foster the doctor touch. If you leave this seat midway… it will remain empty for three years. And I can't afford that. If you want to make your career, go right ahead… but after three years. As long as you're here, I want your full dedication. Is that clear? Ma'am, as I told you, my mother is unwell. But you never brought her here. Uday-0, Gynecology Department-Century. What the hell is the "male touch," dude? Got it now? But if a man touches a woman, it's bound to feel strange. No. Why? It will feel good. It's not supposed to feel good. Then how should it feel? Nothing. It should feel like nothing. Dude, your mom commented on our photo. "You boys fool around and soil your clothes, and I have to wash them." Why did you accept her friend request? For this! Guddu, come down, please! Yeah, Mom? -What are you up to early in the morning? -Can you click a selfie for me? You're all dressed up! Are you going to a party? Take it from that angle, so I don't look fat. But what's the picture for? You'll know if you accept my friend request. Mom, please stop adding my friends on Facebook. You post such embarrassing comments. Okay, sorry. I'm still getting the hang of it. Why don't you sit and properly teach me someday? You want to put it on Facebook? On Facebook, WhatsApp… and… Tinder as well. Tin-- So, you'll go around meeting total strangers?! Well, I'll have to work with strangers even in Kitchen Captain. -Should I give that up as well? -Have you lost it, Mom? If the neighbors find out, what will they say? What will they say if they find out that you peek at ladies' private parts? Ma'am, please do something. I just want a boy. Why don't you buy a lottery ticket with this money? Maybe you'll win a baby boy. Ma'am, you're cracking jokes. No, you're cracking a joke on me! -A horrible joke! -List! Now, leave! Go-- Staring at my face won't give you a baby boy, okay? Kusum Sahu? Pappu Sahu. Please come. Yes, tell me? Is no other doctor available? There's no one else right now, you'll have to settle for me. Why are you looking at me? What can I do? If you could birth a child, we wouldn't have to be here. Hello. What?! Really? Speak loudly! Did you collect the bloody payment or not? Don't pass on his bullshit excuses to me! Please lie down over there. Go? Remove your undergarment first. -What? -Yeah. Not here, behind the curtain. -Lift your sari. -What? Lift your sari. Further up. Spread your legs. Spread them more, or how will I examine you? Spread them. One minute, hang up! Hey! Hey! What's going on? I'm just doing her checkup. -You rascal, how dare you touch my wife! -What the hell, have you gone crazy? -Someone, bloody catch him! -What happened? Catch him! Where did he come from? What were you doing? How dare you! -Hey, what are you doing? -Shut up! -Security! -How dare you push a nurse! What did you do to my wife? Grab him, not me! Get away! This guy misbehaved with my wife! Let doctors do their job! -Move! -Acting too smart? I'll shove a gun up your ass, and you'll piss your pants! What kind of thuggery is this? Really? Your hospital staff is acting like thugs! -This man misbehaved with my wife! -In what way? You came for her checkup, what else will he do? But we wanted a lady doctor, madam! Then you should've gone to a private hospital, not a public one! Only the doctor on duty will check the patient, right? And you, be quiet now! Absolutely quiet! Babies are born down there, so that's where he'll look, right? Or should he look at your face? Is this a circus? Move along! Come on, go back to your seats! What happened, ma'am? Ma'am, it wasn't my fault. I was just doing a regular checkup. I did nothing else. Was there no nurse around? I'm sorry. I just-- It's my fault. Actually, it's our collective fault. I apologize on our behalf. You don't know anything. We should have realized… that you need to be handheld and taught everything from the basics. Read this. Code of Medical Ethics. I guess you didn't read this during your MBBS. When a female patient is being checked by a male doctor, a female subordinate must be present. -Ma'am, I was just trying to-- -What if they raise a complaint? The reputation of this hospital and this department will be ruined… only because of you! Leave. Before you treat a patient, it's important that they feel comfortable around you. Talk to them, put them at ease. Come, try. Doctor, put an extra stitch if you can. After the last delivery, it got all loose down there. My husband was complaining. Dr. Uday Gupta… Night duty's the only thing left! It's no fun being the lone bull in a barn of cows! What do you keep muttering all day? What can I say, man? Since Dr. Nandini lectured me about the male touch, my nipples are oozing milk. How would I lose the male touch if no patient lets me touch her? Even if I become a gynecologist, I'll just be holed up in a corner of my clinic like armpit hair! Another vestigial organ! But you know what? Vestigial organs aren't all that useless. For example, foreskin! Many people consider it a vestigial organ… but do you know how it's useful? No, I don't want to know. Seriously, let's not go there. I just want to clear the nationals and get Ortho, that's it! Listen, when you encounter accident cases where bones stick out, are shattered, and hanging loose, then you'll feel that Gynae was not all that gross. Gynae is not all that gross. It is gross, but that's not the reason to leave it. Then? How should I explain it? I mean… You mean you won't find patients? In our neighborhood, boys play cricket, and girls play badminton. -So? -Some things don't suit guys, you know? Right. If you had played badminton with girls, you wouldn't have talked such rubbish. You deserve night duty! Your face tells a million stories Look into my eyes, and you shall see Every time I see you My heart skips a beat I see you everywhere It's not my fault, really This heart is under love's spell It won't listen to me I studied in an all-boys school. Even during MBBS, I only hung out with guys. There was just one girl in our entire batch, and I fell in love with her, and… -She broke your heart in a zillion pieces? -No, it's not like that. She always told me that I just can't hear women… and you know what? She was right! I really never tried to listen, I was such an ass-- What's your point? The point is… that I played a lot of cricket with the boys in the hood but never played badminton with the girls. If I had, I wouldn't have felt so weird and awkward saying sorry to you. Jenny, listen. I'm sorry, man. Please forgive me. It's okay. It happens. We're cool. The reason to live that I was looking for The home that I was searching for It's you, yes, it's you The vision in my dreams My wish upon the stars It's you, yes, it's you Whenever you're out of sight I feel a little less alive I see you everywhere It's not my fault, really This heart is under love's spell It won't listen to me I see you everywhere It's not my fault, really This heart is under love's spell It won't listen to me One is an absolute indication, and the other is a relative indication. So, did anything happen between you two? Bro, gentlemen don't kiss and tell! So, are you planning to tell Auntie about her? Bro… She's a Muslim though. That won't be an issue. Yes, of course! I don't care about these things! Guddu, have some and tell me how it is. -It tastes like poha. -Never mind. It's pasta! And you put curry leaves in it! But without any seasoning, Western food tastes so bland. Then, don't make Western food. Stick to Indian cuisine. How will I become a chef if I don't experiment? Will you try some? Wait till you come asking me to make you chow mein… I'll make chow mein out of you! How's it going? What's up? I need to get back for an MTP, so I'll catch you later. Please. The patients there are hounding me, and now, you're ignoring me. Sorry. It's just that after that day… it's a bit awkward. Really? -Okay, but I have to go now! -Where "I have to go"? Madam, what's going on between us? Why are you behaving so hot and cold? Uday… I really want you in my life. You're a really good friend of mine. I don't want to lie, I have no intention of hurting you… but that day… This thing between us… -Aar- -Relationship! No! -Aar- -Kiss! That was amazing! No! I mean, it was-- I knew it! Uday, the truth is that… -Aar- -Our what? What? Aarif, man! Aarif! Uday, I'm getting engaged to him. And I'm pretty sure that I want to be with him. So, let's stop this now… or you'll get hurt later. I won't get hurt. I'm okay. What do you mean? I mean it's all cool. We can carry on as it is. So, you just want to fool around?! Do you want to marry me? No, right? Then why are you blaming me? Great! That's why I'm saying let it be the way it is. Your ex-girlfriend was right. You really are deaf when it comes to women! Mom, it hurts too much. Have patience, dear. You saw her in the OPD, she's your patient. Obviously, I'm going to call you! My ears are bleeding here because of her non-stop screaming! That woman's been doing this drama for an hour. Check her dilatation, I bet it's nothing. Yeah. -Hi, Uday. -Hi! I'm Aarif. We've met once before. I'm Fatima's fiance. Yeah, I-- Come, sit. Come. -Lunch? -Thank you. -Sure? -Yeah. I believe you and Fatima went to a medical camp recently. Yes! Yeah, we were there. At the medical camp, absolutely yes. -You spent quite a lot of time there. -Yes… with patients. They were very happy with us. Sure. And you spent a good amount of time with each other as well. Yes! I'm so stupid. Of course. We had lunch and stuff together, just like this. I haven't seen her around much recently. We've not had lunch together since we got back. Very weird. Normally, she's here. You seem like a really nice guy. -I'm so sorry-- -It's okay. I ruined your shirt. It's okay. You know, whenever I ask Fatima where she is, she says, "With Uday." "Whom are you talking to?" To Uday. "Whose text is it?" Uday's. Some days ago, she told me… Actually, she started crying… and she told me about the kiss. I said if you've developed feelings for someone else, then you don't have to get engaged under family pressure. I'm not trying to be a saint or anything… but if you like somebody else, let's not waste each other's time. You know, but before jumping to any conclusion, I thought I should ask you if it's anything serious. Sure. Go ahead. Hello. Yeah, Sunita, I'll be right there. Hold on. Aarif, you don't have to worry about anything. You just chill, okay? Happy anniversary! Oh. Happy engagement. -Bye. -Oh, God. She's there. -Yes? -Doctor, it hurts a lot. That's bound to happen. It'll take you some time. There's a long queue for the labor room. -Please wait. -Please check her. -Doctor… -Doctor, please listen! -Doctor, please take a look. -Doctor! -Hold on, please. -Doctor, please listen! Where are you going? Doctor, it hurts too much. I think the baby's on its way. Hey, not here! What are you doing? -Everyone's here-- -Doctor, it hurts too much! Mom! Doctor, looks like it's something complicated. -She's leaking! -I shouldn't have gone to see him! Has dilatation occurred? It's precipitate labor! It's happened before. If it's precipitate, the baby will be out soon! Come, we need to go to the labor room! Now! -Labor room? -He should experience this. -Let's go. -Then he'll understand! But who's going to conduct the delivery? You! Do you see anyone else around here? Okay, we're almost there. Careful! Take it easy! Ward boy! I'll get the stretcher. Hold on, I'll get it. No, get a delivery tray! The baby is crowning! We'll have to deliver the baby right here! Here? Have you gone mad? -Kavita, breathe. -Shahjahan. Come in front of the ward with a delivery tray quickly! Yeah. Don't push now. Just take deep breaths. Will the delivery be fine? Yes, ma'am. He's a fine doctor, you're in safe hands. Relax. Take it easy. -Please move back. -All of you, cover… -Don't push, just take deep breaths. -Mom, I can't take it anymore! Breathe slowly. Don't push too hard, I can see the baby. It's almost over. -Mom! -That's it, it's almost there. Ma'am, congratulations! Didn't I tell you you're in safe hands! Cheers to Dr. Uday Gupta! Please say a few words. So, you cut an umbilical cord for the first time. How does it feel? I have so many friends online who are now married. They keep sharing photos and videos of their kids… and it annoys me so much, like, what's the big deal? It's just a baby, not some alien life from Mars for everyone to look at it and say, "So cute!" But today, after the delivery, I actually felt like… "Shit! This should have been on video!" -Not bad, Uday! -Right? Ma'am is here. What's going on? Ma'am, Uday just conducted his first delivery, independently. So, we were just celebrating. So, you get a special prize for doing your duty?! Kumud, did you get such special treatment? Ma'am, it's Uday, so… So what if it's Uday? Is it because he's a man or because he's incompetent? You must have faced many difficulties being a man. You managed this delivery with such difficulty… in the corridor, like cattle, in front of a big crowd! Ma'am, it was a special case. Obviously, it was a special case because he didn't check the dilatation on time! Ma'am, Sunita checked the dilatation. Is Sunita the doctor or you? And what's your problem with looking at the vagina? You can probe an ear or even intestines with your hands… then what's the big deal about a vagina? Ma'am, it's the patients who are scared of me. Ma'am, you tell me honestly, would you be okay being examined by me? I'll tell you honestly… I would be okay being examined by you if you were a competent gynecologist! Many of the top gynecologists in this country are male. Ma'am, what you're saying isn't fair. No, what you're doing in this department, that is not fair! Oh, by the way… Pappu Sahu and his wife have filed a complaint against you. There will be an inquiry. Dr. Uday, come with me. Come on! Namaste, doctor. Doctor… please come inside. Thank you, doctor… for saving my baby's life. I'm extremely grateful to you. This was my third pregnancy. The last two babies couldn't be saved. Doctor… look at his hand. We name our children… after God. Uday-1, Gynecology Department… whatever. We are just lucky that they didn't file a police complaint. You didn't have any female present in the room while examining the patient?! That's very unprofessional! And now I hear that you pulled another stunt yesterday. Anyway, what's going to happen now is that each one of your colleagues will be called separately for questioning by the disciplinary committee. But before that happens, I wanted to meet you. Do you want to say anything? Sir, I am very well aware that I made a mistake. I got distracted because of my postgrad entrance exams. But now I am committed, sir. But why are you so averse to Gynae? You know… the two deans here before me were both gynecologists. Yes, sir, but you are… -What? -Nothing, sir. What is it? He wants to say that you're an orthopedician. So, are you saying he wasn't at fault at all? Sir, he was negligent that day, but the OPD was severely understaffed. And when Uday was new here, he was very uncomfortable, he used to be distracted. In fact, I also thought he was a first-rate idiot. This often happens in our department. Women come and start screaming loudly just to get into the labor room. Have you ever worked with him? Recently, there was a couple… who had been trying to conceive for years, and Dr. Uday handled the case pretty well. Over time, he's shown progress. He is trying to improve. Ma'am, you know how it is with patients these days… they often get violent with doctors. Yes, Doctor Uday was late in checking the dilatation, but once he did it, he was lightning fast! Like Rajinikanth's action scene. Whistle-worthy. Madam, marriage doesn't seem to be in the cards for you. -Shut up. -List. Check again! I swear I read your palm properly! According to the reports, there's no problem with your semen count or your vaginal cavity. Keep trying, and you'll surely conceive. I've been trying for the last year and a half. It's just a matter of luck sometimes. Doctor, I may not be Arjun from the Mahabharat, whose arrow hit the fish's eye in the first attempt… but I've shot my arrow 116 times in a year. You know what I mean? You're keeping count?! There are so many times I forget to count, doctor. Must be over 116 times. Right, Sonal? Please prescribe some medicine. I can't. There's nothing wrong with you. Not for me, for her. I know I'm perfectly fine. She's also perfectly fine. There's nothing I can do here. Just keep trying. Best of luck. Let's go. Let's go. Where's the bathroom around here? Oh, yes. Go straight and take a left from the lobby. Thanks. "He doesn't know where to enter, he gets into the wrong door." Jagdish, I didn't want to say this in front of your wife. After all, some things should stay between men. Right. Tell me. We, men, always march to the beat of our own drum. A real man needs no one's approval, right? Right, doctor. But confidence can also be a stumbling block… and by God, look how you've stumbled! Stumbled how, doctor? Jagdish, you had two doors to enter. If only you had knocked before, you wouldn't have entered the wrong door. Knocked, why? To ask which door to enter! -Which door? -Do I look like a doorman to you?! Do you see that lady doctor there with your wife? She's explained to her… which door leads to a baby. Jagdish, sometimes, it's good to ask before you act. Okay? So, all I get is a brownie as a "thank you"?! I bet you popped a bottle of champagne for Fatima! For her, I'd even fight Thanos and get the Infinity Stone! But I guess she wants someone else's stone on her finger. Based on one guess, Doctor Strange risked the fate of half the universe. So, if your heart still sings in hope… take a risk! Suhani, will you marry me? What?! Yes! -Hi. -Hi! Man, Uday, I just told Dean the truth. What's this big treat for? -Come. -Okay. This is so lame! That's nothing. I once bribed the boys in my school ten bucks each to write me 118 testimonials on Orkut. Hey, Ram! You're so pathetic! Uff, Allah! Fatima Siddiqui, it's so cute to hear you say, "Hey, Ram!" Hey, listen. I got you something. What is this? Open it. Ortho! I've written you a note on the first page. I'll read it at home. Come on, open it now! Fatima. Open it! No, listen to me. I want to tell you something. You know, I was saying that… Mom?! What are you doing here? What are you… doing… Come on, introduce us! Hello, I'm Uday's mother. Namaste, Auntie. I'm Fatima. Of course, I know. He's mentioned you so many times! All he does is talk instead of inviting his girlfriend-- -No, Auntie. I'm not his girlfriend-- -He always talks about you. Right, Guddu? -Who's this man, Mom? -Who? Oh, he's a friend. I was planning to introduce you two. -This is Guddu, this is Mr. Vinod-- -Auntie, bye. I should leave now, I have to be on duty. Bye. So soon? Continue your date. Fatima! Fatima! Fatima, what happened? What's cooking in that brain of yours? The same thing that's cooking between us. And what's that? What's cooking between us? You said it yourself that you want me in your life! Yes… as a friend. As a friend! You know, Uday, when Aarif met you… I was so scared and nervous. I was scared of what you might say to him… or that you might exaggerate what happened between us. And I was so goddamn happy when you said to him, "Congratulations on your engagement!" I thought, "Thank God! I haven't lost a friend." Please don't spoil that. Spoil what? Spoil what? You tell me! Things only get spoiled for you. We have no feelings, after all! When you feel like it, you'll put your head on my shoulders, feed me sweets with your hands, or sit tightly behind me on the bike. And then, suddenly, it's all about Aarif! God knows how many other ifs and buts! I just don't understand you women! I don't get you one bit! You know what? Go to hell! Life's tragedy will have its curtain call Bosses and seniors will beg and crawl Happy birthday! Seasons will change, autumn will come Flaws will wither like leaves in the fall Newton, one day, the apple will fall Newton, one day, the apple will fall Newton, one day, the apple will fall -Shall I quickly make you a snack? -Newton, one day, the apple will fall You're late again! Ma'am, I'm just seven minutes late. Brain death occurs seven minutes after death. It won't happen again, ma'am. I mean, brain death will occur after death, but I won't be late. Stopping the main blood flow to the uterus will stop the bleeding. Check for hemostasis and stitch her up. Dr. Gupta, you do it. Ma'am, me?! Yes, Last Man Standing. The movie of your life May have some sad scenes Done, ma'am! Drink up all your sorrows Let life make you keen If not today Tomorrow, surely, pigs will fly No task is impossible As long as you try It's a twin delivery. The patient is in active labor. Ma'am, I've never done a twin delivery. You had never done a corridor delivery either. -The Gods shall anoint you -One, two, three, push! Push out the baby, not this! Okay, let's do this, come on. -Hail the Almighty… -Lord Ganesha! Let's do this again! Praise the Lord's abode! Praise be! The treasures you seek Shall answer your call Newton, one day, the apple will fall -Yes. -Newton, one day, the apple will fall Newton, one day, the apple will fall Congratulations, Dr. Gupta, you've done it! -Newton, one day, the apple will fall -You've entered the leaderboard! Amazing! Double congratulations! The letter from the committee has arrived. The complaint against you has been dismissed. Well done! Newton, one day, the apple will fall Hello, brother! -Guddu, I need to talk to you. -Tell me. -Come for dinner tomorrow. -Sure, I will. Guddu, listen. The civil service exam results are out. The poor boy worked so hard, but he couldn't make it. He's putting up a brave front, but he's really upset. He says he'll leave the city. Check on him, will you? I heard him cry. I flunked again, man. It's okay, buddy. You can always try again. I've tried enough. I want to go home. Guddu. Yes, brother? Listen, there's been a mishap. That girl… Kavya. Yes, brother? She's pregnant. Here you go! Piping hot kebabs for you! Tell me how they taste. -They're great, sister-in-law. -Is the salt okay? Too good! Finish them quickly. I'll go and prepare dinner. It's been over two months. The silly girl says… she didn't realize that her period was late. So, what now, brother? I need your help, man. Okay, brother. The kids are growing up. I have to be a family man now. Everyone here knows me. I can't go with her to the hospital. In such times, one can only count on family, right? Yes, brother. Papa, Mama's calling you! Dinner's getting cold! Yes, we're just coming. -Let's go. -Brother, I'll leave. What about dinner? I have to prepare for my nationals' mock test. Guddu… can I count on you? Yes, brother. Hi. Do you have an extra pair of clothes? No. Okay. Will you be taking me to the hospital? Yeah. Didn't brother tell you? I thought you only came to pick me up from school… and that he'll take me to the hospital. Look at this, sir. This one will look beautiful on her. Yeah, okay. And this one has an amazing fit. Try it on, my dear. Do you want a different color? No, it's fine. What's your age? Kavya, what's your age? I have to say I'm 18, I know! He repeated it ten times over the phone. Fatima, I have a favor to ask. There's a patient. She needs an MTP. Please do it. -Now? -It's an emergency. My patient is in labor. I'll handle it. Why don't you do the MTP? She's my sister. A distant cousin, so… -Has she had a checkup before? -It needs to be done. Fine, you handle the patient. Come. Hi, Kavya. I'm Dr. Fatima. What's your age? Eighteen. This is your first pregnancy, I'm presuming? Wide. Breathe. Did you do a test? Yes, with a self-kit. Your brother said it's been over two months. He's not my brother. He's not my brother. Okay. Does it hurt over here? A bit. Okay. Get up. We'll do your ultrasound now. Uday. Dr. Uday! -Let go. -No! Let go! -Yeah, Fatima? -Uday, Kavya has placenta previa. Look. The placenta is right at the cervix. An MTP would be very risky. Excessive bleeding could occur, and it could even be fatal. Shit! But we can operate and abort, right? I can't do it. I really think you should speak to Nandini ma'am. Nandini ma'am… And Uday, I'm saying this as a friend… tell Nandini ma'am the truth… because it's very obvious that you're lying. No… She told me you're not her brother. Yeah… she's my friend's girlfriend. As in my brother's, he's my cousin. And why didn't he come here with her? He's married. He has a reputation to maintain. Didn't he think of that while having sex with her? Come on, many people have affairs! You're about to get married, but you did kiss me, right? Yes, I did! So? Should I have had sex with you too since you were clearly hoping for it? Whatever I did was of my own accord. I knew what I was doing. But that girl's only 18… and she's pregnant! Do you even understand? Is she even 18? Dr. Nandini Srivastava, Gynaec HOD. Sir, ward two. Okay, thank you. This is not advisable at all. It could be life-threatening. Ma'am, but it is possible, right? Yes, if someone insists that, we can do it… but we need the immediate family's consent. Ma'am, there's practically nobody. Her mother stays in the village and isn't well, so, you know, it's not practical. How is she related to you? Don't insult my intelligence. I understand why her mother can't come. Then you also must be understanding how important this abortion is. -All the societal pressure-- -I understand it, but don't you understand that, as doctors, we need to be concerned about our patients and not what society thinks? There are many shelters outside the city where she can secretly deliver the child. I'll give you the contacts, you can guide her, but… please follow the Code of Medical Ethics. Yes, ma'am. I don't want my department to get into any kind of problems. Brother, the placenta is right on the cervix. No doctor is ready to do an abortion. There could be excessive bleeding. It's risky. It could be fatal. Listen, Uday, can you keep Kavya at your place for a couple of days? I can't keep whisking her off from school… and I don't want to leave her alone in a hotel. If she does something stupid like slashing her wrists… it will be a disaster. Alright, brother. First, you didn't come to take me. Now, you're packing me off to his house. But-- Listen, my pre-board exams are coming up! -I have to go to your house, I know. -Kavya, we can't go right now. I'm on duty. You'll have to wait a while. The canteen's there. Here is some money. I have money! Using easily available ingredients from our own kitchen, we made these simple yet tasty dishes… quickly, in a snap. -Mom, what's going on? -Wait a minute. SHOBHA'S SPICY KITCHEN To learn more such lip-smacking recipes, subscribe to my channel! -Was that okay? -Yes, very nice! I was making a practice video. It's for the test, Guddu! I'm planning to make 8-10 dishes. What do you think? But what are all these shiny lights for? They look nice, don't they? This is Kavya. -Namaste. -Namaste. My colleague's sister. I told you, remember? Yes, of course. Stay here for as long as you need, dear. Give her your room. -Chaddi, I'll sleep in your room. -Okay. Please put on some clothes. No chance, all my stuff is packed! Upload the video! Yeah, when is the submission? No, I'll write it. I'll be back in a day or two. Shweta, the-- Yeah, bye. Have your dinner. Are you okay? I have to write a 500-word essay… and I'm really struggling. What's the topic of the essay? "Who is the most influential person in your life and why?" I can understand. You know, if I had to write this essay last week, I'd have aced it. But today, I'm just so ashamed to write it. It's okay. You're still a kid. I'm not ashamed of falling in love, Uday. I'm ashamed of being stupid. Ashok's tossing me like a football… from school to hospital, from the hospital to your place. Now God knows where to next! At one moment, I did feel… that maybe he was not a good guy. I was so stupid that I didn't listen to myself. At what moment did you feel that? When he egged you on to lash out at your ex-girlfriend. -Allis… -Ma'am. Allis! Sorry, ma'am. -You'll come, right? -Of course, it's your engagement! -Bye. -Bye. Boski and Jenny have made plans to drink till 4:00 a.m. Will you come? You're back early. No work today? Wasn't in the mood. Me neither. Didn't write your essay? But it's okay. I'll manage. I'll just think of some fictional character to write it. It's not like English grades will help me get through my medical exams. Do you really want to become a doctor? Yeah. Let's go. I'll show you something. We'll be late, Mom. Have your dinner and sleep. What's over here? Inspiration! When you get selected, this is where you'll have classes. Whether happy or sad, I never shed a tear But this very moment Something has stirred Monsoon has struck again I wasn't even born in 2000. I'm drenched in joyous rain The withering flower of my dreams Has blossomed with a drop All my rancor and fears Washed away with a single tear The Maggi here is the best thing in the entire solar system. -What's that? -The girls' hostel. These stirrings washed away All the walls I built around me They crumpled and melted Like paper boats in the sea Have you ever performed on stage? No. I'm more into sports. As fulfilled as it was once empty Life has again embraced me This place stays open all night. Can you play badminton? -The withering flower of my dreams -You play really bad. Has blossomed with a drop You suck! Yes, brother. Uday, get Kavya to my clinic. I've figured out a way. -Okay? -Okay. Uday, wait there. I'll come down. Why, what's up? Mom! Hello, I'm Vinod Kumar Jaiswal. Jaiswal Furniture in the market… I own that shop. What are you doing, Mom? Sorry, Uday. I was going to leave today, so I wanted to see Mr. Vinod before I leave. Are you done? Then leave. Bye. Are you done meeting Chaddi? He's getting late. Drop him off at the station. He should've left long back. -I'll take your leave. -Okay. Take care, Auntie. You too. Kavya, let's pack your stuff. Well… bye-bye, Doctor G. What is it, Guddu? Are you ashamed of me? Mom, I would've left this house long ago. I could have gone to Mandsaur, taken Ortho, and made my career. I've sacrificed a lot to be here with you. I too dreamed of having a career, Guddu. I was just in my BA Final Year… when your father died leaving me pregnant with you. I had no clue how I was going to manage everything. I had decided to get an abortion. But your grandma found out that I was pregnant with a son. What could I do then? Don't you think I yearned for a companion? To have someone hold my hand? Can't I have any desires? But I did nothing. I stayed alone and raised you on my own. You're not the only one who has made sacrifices, Guddu! Won't you come inside? No. Take care of yourself. Call me if you need me. Uday! If you had to write an essay on the most influential person in your life… you'd write about your mother, right? Please don't make her feel stupid. -Bye. -Bye. Namaste, sir. Actually, I went to your shop. I found your address there. Your mother has removed me from her Facebook friend list. What do you want now? I'm not on her Facebook friend list either… but I'm still her son, right? I'm… I'm really sorry. If you want to win her over, get her ghee laddoos. She's a softie. She'll melt instantly. I got a text from Mr. Vinod. Thank you. Sorry, Mom. -Yes, Kavya? -Uday! Uday, I'm in a lot of pain! I think I'll die! Where are you? What happened? They've given me some injection. It's been hurting terribly ever since. What injection? Where are you? Have me speak to Ashok. He's gone out somewhere. I'm in a clinic. Shabri Clinic in Misrod. They said that the abortion will be done within 7-8 hours. Give the phone to a doctor. Uday, there's no one here! I'm very scared! Don't worry, I'll be there in ten minutes. -Okay? -What happened to her? Guddu! What are you doing? Let me come along. The girl's all alone, you'll need help. Come on. What does Ashok have to do with this? I'll tell you later. I always thought he was shady. -Mom, open Maps. -Maps? Here, quick. Unlock the phone first! It shows some Shabri Clinic… but it's not in Misrod, it seems to be on Hoshangabad Road. Left… no, right! Do you even know how to use the map? Of course! Left… Jenny's calling! Hello! Left or right? Why aren't you coming for Fatima's engagement? She's calling you for the engagement! Are we going the right way? -You need to take a left! -Oh, no! -Guddu! -Hang up the phone first! Okay. Are we on the correct route? The map's just going around in circles. SHABRI CLINIC -This is it, right? -Seems like it. Let's go. What is this place?! -Yes? -My sister's here. Kavya Sharma. Wait a minute, I'll check. Hurry up! Give me the phone. Where did she go? Come on! Ma'am… Wait, sir! Where are you going? Stop! I'll deal with you later! -Kavya… -Uday! Are you okay? Where does it hurt? Here! -Where did they inject you? -Down there. -Two hours ago. -What injection? Where's brother? Someone, call a doctor! Whatever you want to ask, do it outside. Tell me what injection you gave her, or I'll call the police. The doctor's not here, he's gone home. You're doing the abortion of an underage girl! Guddu! Uday, dude, what's this drama? Jenny, listen to me carefully. It's a case of placenta previa. What injection is given in the vagina for an abortion? What is this procedure? In the vagina? What injection? I don't know, wait a minute. Come here. Just breathe. Prostaglandin. Shit. It must be Prostaglandin gel. It's very dangerous for the placenta previa. She's in a lot of pain. Oh God, no! There should be no bleeding. Listen, you need to operate immediately! Okay. -Mom! -Yes… -Call a taxi quickly! -Okay. Can you walk? Auto! Stop! Please, sir! What a jerk! Come on. Give me the ambulance key. -Mom, let's go. -I don't have it. Give it to me before I slap you! -Quickly! -I don't have the key. Really? Liar! Give me the phone. Hello, Ashok? I'll smack you so hard, it'll ring in your ears forever! Got it? Mom, call Kavya's mother quickly! Mama's going to be very angry. She won't be. I'm here, don't worry. Calm down. Hello. Are you Kavya's mother? Okay, listen to me-- Please don't get alarmed. Actually, Kavya's admitted to BIMS Bhopal. Please get there as fast as possible, okay? And please don't worry, alright? Guddu, she's bleeding. Just tell Mom to come soon, and tell her not to worry. Say that doctors are with you. Just tell her that. Mama, I'm okay, doctors are with me. Just come quickly, please. Mom, touch Kavya's abdomen and check if there are any contractions. It's hard as a stone. Hello, Shahjahan! Get a stretcher to the emergency gate! Yes, quickly! We're nearly there. How much further up? We're almost there, madam. Let's go! Easy. Mom, wait here. Call Kavya's mom. -Yes. -Let's go. Hey, wait! -There's an operation going on! -Make space for another! Easy, over here. Dr. Uday! What's going on? What is this? Ma'am, she'll die. Please. Okay. Put on your scrubs. Yes, ma'am. Doctor, what's going on? Nothing. Please relax. Your baby's on its way. Is this a joke? Tossing me from one place to another! Are we playing musical chairs here? Madam, please calm down, we're doing your stitches. Then finish stitching me up before you start on her! -Herding us in here like cattle! -Are you done? I paid the full fees, didn't I? -Ready, ma'am. -Look, your baby boy is here. We should've put her under general anesthesia. What is going on? Is this your emergency? Ma'am, she's in a very critical condition. It's the placenta previa case, right? Is she underage? Don't lie to me. Did you inform the police? This could be a rape case. Ma'am, we've informed her mother. Let's decide once she's here. Are you serious? Ma'am, there's been a lot of bleeding. Please. -Vitals! -Ma'am, BP 90/60, pulse 100, because of Prostaglandin. Ma'am, there's a lot of PV bleeding. -Will she be okay? -I don't know. Dr. Veena, give her two units of blood. Check her vitals continuously. -Okay, ma'am. -Next two hours are critical. Yes, ma'am. Are you bloody crazy? What have you done? That hospital was slapping a kidnapping charge on you! -I stopped them! -It was a dumpster, not a hospital! You left her there to die just to save your skin! Brother, there's no guarantee whether that girl will live or die. I can't risk my reputation, Uday. What kind of man are you? If you want to save your reputation, beg Kavya's mother for forgiveness. She's probably going to charge you with rape! Not probably, she definitely will. I'll make sure of it! You're going to rot in jail! You were my hero. She's a minor. It's a rape case. Inform the police. And tell Dr. Uday to come and see me immediately. Yes, sir. Kavya's mother is here. Namaste. -Where's Kavya? -Inside. Wait, stop! You're not allowed in here. Let's go. Have faith. Ashok! What have you done! We trusted you so much… and you stabbed us in the back! If her father were here today, he'd have strangled you. Preying on the daughter of the man you owe your career to! Have you no shame? -She's just a child! -Excuse me, please come here. He treated you like his own son. He thought of you as Kavya's guardian. You've turned this into a family feud! Ma'am, she was in a bad state. She could've died. Exactly! Because of your mistake, that girl could've died… on my table. I had advised against it. And you still didn't feel the need to consult me. Ma'am, I spoke to Jenny, you can ask her. You lied that she's an adult! You've committed a crime, and you could go to jail for this. You broke all the ethics, all the rules! Come with me to Dean's cabin right now. And I'll make sure that you never get the license to practice. -Ma'am-- -Fifteen minutes. These are your last few moments in this hospital. Go, get that girl's case files. Ma'am, she's conscious now. Kavya… Mama… I'm sorry! I'm here for you, sweetheart! I rushed here as soon as I found out! Thank you… for everything! Don't be stupid. Because you're not! Thank you… for saving my daughter's life. I'll be forever indebted to you. You'll be fine, my dear. Mama… Don't you worry. Dear Uday, I hope you never need this book. I don't want you to leave this department. There was a time when you kept trying to find ways to escape this department. But things have changed. Because you have changed. It makes me very happy to see you triumph… and even happier to see you fight. Never give up. Love, Fatima. In the case of a minor's abortion, you should've informed the police first. Yes, sir. You have betrayed the Code of Medical Ethics. Yes, sir. Have the police begun their investigation? Yes, sir. Dr. Uday… this is the second complaint against you in the last three months. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. I'm really sorry about it. And whatever punishment you give me, I'm ready for it. But sir, I want to say one thing to you… especially, to Nandini ma'am. You kept trying to teach me that I have to lose the male touch if I want to become a good gynecologist. And you know what? Believe it or not… today, I have lost that male touch. Not just in this hospital but outside as well. Dr. Nandini… do you think we should rusticate him? He's absolutely right about two things… that I tried very hard to teach him, and that I don't trust him at all. As for the matter of rusticating him… to decide that, I need to observe him closely. So, I want him to remain… in my department for now. You have a lot of work, doctor. Leave! Yes, ma'am. Finally, Uday is here! Congratulations. Thanks, brother. Thanks. I'm so happy that you made it! And I just don't mean to my engagement. -I mean-- -Fatima… all this while, when I was angry with you, Richa, and my mother… I never looked within myself. If I had, I'd have realized that the problem was within me. You know what… whenever you told me that we're "just friends," I'd get so mad, I'd boil with rage! Because I felt like you were telling me, "Uday, Aarif is the one in my life, not you!" Aar-if… "Our" if! Today, I gathered the courage and opened the book. The one you gave me. I read what you wrote and understood that… what Chaddi and I feel for each other… is exactly what you feel for me! And if I left, you would be as sad as I am about Chaddi leaving. I couldn't even say bye to him properly. Fatima… will you be the second Chaddi of my life?
