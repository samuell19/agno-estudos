Sir, as per your instructions, I have kept his body in the mortuary. EXACTLY 18 DAYS AGO IN HYDERABADâ€¦ Welcome, everyone! My brother, Sri. Nanda Gopal Chakravarthy, established the People Mart company, where fifty percent of its revenue is spent on providing free education and medical care to its employees at the corporate level. Today, the Government of India has recognized his services and conferred on him the Padma Shri award. As his younger brother, I feel proud. Now my brother will speak. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just like everyone else, I once felt sad and wonderedâ€¦ "Why am I not successful?" I was really sad. Do you know what I have done to attain success? If you bury the seeds of a bamboo tree and water it, you won't yield anything the next day. You won't get anythingâ€¦ even after a week. Nothing after a month as well. Not evenâ€¦ in a year. But after three years, it will sprout. And after that, we witness its growth. Do you know what it does in those three years? The higher it grows, the deeper it sinks its roots. After getting success, how much we want to rise, depends on how much groundwork we do even before we get it. That groundwork is the reason for the success. Thank you. That's why I believe in growing step by step. One thing I want to say to all my People Mart family members. I call you family members, but I truly want to make you all my family members. But I don't know how. I'm dying in two months. I am suffering from a Neurodegenerative disease. Doctors gave me a maximum of two months to live. As the head of the family, I felt it was my duty to tell you this. I am living happily. I want to die happily. I am living successfully. I want to die successfully. Please, sir. Please. Sir, I worked really hard to build this company. Sir, it's the result of my 15 years of hard work. Please ask him to spare me. Please. Bro, at least you tell him. Please tell him, bro. Please ask him to spare me. How can you beg like that? He who cannot protect himself can never be the king. Am I right? Those who have empty pockets want money. Those who have money, want power. And those with power, want the world. A growing company is like a growing girl. If you sit out lazing around like this, someone will seize it. Mr. Nanda Gopal Chakravarthy, the recipient of the Padma Shri award, declared that he would distribute 50% of the shares in his company, People Mart, to his employees. I want to say something to my People Mart family members. In the next two months, I am going to distribute all the shares of People Mart company equally to all the employees and make them my family members. It seems we might not just get a kingdomâ€¦ but the whole empire. Atharva, I was just thinking about an appropriate gift for your upcoming birthday. Now I know what to give you. Yesterday, who came to my house and threatened my father in my absence and asked him to hand over the property? -It was me. -It was me. -It was me. -It was me. Don't get confused and commit to your answers. Once I start thrashing, in the same tune you'll start saying, "It wasn't me." That is why think before you speak. After I start thrashing, I won't listen. Do you even know whose territory you have set foot in? You bloodyâ€¦ We were just talking, right? Why did you hit him? -I could see a villain in him. -So what? If I see a villain in you, you will see a hero in me. If I see a villain in you, you will see a hero in me. So, when I am talking, ensure that a villain in you doesn't come out. First, you have to go out from here, right? See, if the villain comes out like thisâ€¦ the hero will come out like this. See, even the villain in you is coming out. -What is your problem? -What is your problem? Brother, please don't mind. But if the villain in us comes out, then the hero in him will come out as well, as he said. So? Do you want us to remain silent? Yes! If you remain silent and control your anger, then he will answer nicely like Chaganti Koteswara Rao. Brother, what is your problem? -Mother asked me to get some fruit. -Then go to the fruit shop. Yesterday, someone came home grinding his teeth. She wants his teeth. If you grind your teeth like that, then he'll take them out. Smile. A little more. Turn towards him. Brother, what is your real problem? I am not yet married. At home, they are looking for a match for me. Until then, do want me to send someone? Do you have that business too? What does he think about me? What do you think? Oh, God! Oh, no! Are you happy now? -Have you cooled down? -Why is he after me? In my life, I have never come across a person with this much clarity. You don't know how to ask him a question. Why are coming at him like that? Smile. A little more. Turn towards him. -Brotherâ€¦ -Bro! You said we threatened someone yesterday. But we threaten ten guys every day. How do we know who was your father among them? One second! Okay. -Father! -Yes. Did you finish one round? Done. The entertainment round is going on right now. -Isn't it, right? -Yes, yes. -Show me. -See. Oh, you are his son? We will snatch that house by killing everyone in your family. There he comes. The villain in all of you has come out. Except you, the villain in all of you has come out. The hero in me is coming out. He is coming out. Hold this. Hey, you said it's been a while since you've seen your son fight, right? -Yes! -Come, come. -See. -Show me. Dear, you said it's been a while since you've seen your brother fight, right? Come, come. Hey, hit that bald guy now! He was talking too much yesterday. -Beat him. -Everyone will get some extra. Look at this. You were talking too much, right? -That's it! -Madam, you keep calm. You're provoking your son to hit us more. If something happens to us, then we don't even have health insurance. Then why did you cross his path? He is already a crazy person! He only provokes and he only beats. What do we do? Our time is bad. Oh! This reminds me, did you go to the office? It's time already. Oh! I forgot about it. Let me give them a small warning and then I will go. Bye. -Bye! -Bye! -My father told me only one thing. -What did he say? If there's a fight, then just fight. Don't think. I'm a common man, aren't I? This is enough, right? -Enough. -Say that with a smile. -Enough. -More. Enough! Good boy. Earlier, I told my mother that I will just give you a warning. But I don't know how to threaten using dialogues. Just imagine! Since this was your first mistake, I came here with a silencer. If this happens again, then I'll bring a knife. Do you know what it would be like if I cut your body parts with a knife? Thank God! I didn't get the knife and that's why you still have your hands. They look good on you. Be careful. -Shall I go then? -Okay, Brother! -What? -Brother, nothing. -Ask him to go quickly. -Brother, please go. Where is Anand? He's getting ready. Sir, tablets. Did something go wrong in Vizag? Sir, it'sâ€¦ What happened in Vizag? VIZAG Keep a close watch on those who survey in Hyderabad. Sir, we have marked the lines already. The only thing left is to connect them. If you can verify onceâ€¦ Who are you? Just because I've stepped foot on your 200 acres of land, you ask me, who am I and who permitted me to enter. As an ex-MLA of this Vizag constituency which is spread across 682 sq. km, in which you not only entered but also gave thousands of jobs and built projects worth hundreds of crores, shouldn't I ask you, who are you and who permitted you to enter? Please, sir! Don't create a mess. Let us sit and talk. I have come here to talk. That is why my men are behind and you all are alive. No, sir. Listen to what I'm saying once. You listen to what I'm saying! As long as this company is here, I need ten percent of the business. Sir, this is the hard work of some thousands of people. We can't sell this for free and insult their hard work. I am sorry, sir. Fifty people? He has never laid his finger on anyone. How did he come out of this? My father told me one thing, when two people come for a fight, the one who comes forward and strikes is a common man. The one who sits across the table and solves the problemâ€¦ is a businessman. For a mere ten percent of the profit of my company, this man is stupid enough to hire you guys to kill the company owner. Would a sane person be on the side of the one who earns 100 rupees, Or will he be on the side of the person who came begging for ten rupees? And of course, at present, he will take care of you. But for how long will he pay you? Tomorrow when you'll turn 40-50 years old and your strength will decline, will he still take care of you? You want to stop all this and do something. But seeing your background, no one will give you a job. I will. I'll give jobs to all of you in my company so that you live with dignity. Eight hours of work every day. I won't call you like him. I do not call for such things. Work till you're 60 and take a pension after that. You won't have to depend on anyone until you die. My company needs delivery boys. Who else is more qualified than you, who knows every corner of this area? Think about it. If you want to work with me, then kill the evil inside you and come with me. If you want to work with him, then kill me and go inside. Why are you listening to his stories? Kill him! Here comes mass, who stops you Chases you, confronts you, and wins over He is the class who blends his heart And brain into a sharp weapon He is the one with the stiff upper lip He is the corporate power Whatever he touches is like lightning He illuminates like a thousand-watt bulb! He is no less than a landmine! Bro, he is a veritable gold mine! It's a double dhamaka! By nature, he is a rebel Full of aggression A symbol of mass in every human being A prince by birth But always simple He embodies the elements of class In all of us He doesn't mince words Nor waste words The philosophy of his life is Chill bro, chill and chill Take this route or another Any route is fine When he gets into the race He becomes the boss of bosses Here comes mass, who stops you Chases you, confronts you and wins over -Has MD come? -Sir, he came in the morning. You said that you will apply for a loan the other day, did you apply? If it gets approved sooner, then I will spend it. So I didn't. I have applied now. In 15 days, it will be sanctioned. Then marriage after 30 days. Everything will be set. Sir, you're great! Swami, MD sir is calling you. Looks like my loan has been sanctioned! I will see you! Thanks for sanctioning my loan. -Did you get into a fight? -Yes, sir. -I want to see the hero in you. -Sir, I didn't get your point. Termination letter. Why sir? It seems you are not afraid of the one you hit earlier, right? Sir, not at all. -I do fear. -Sir? If he comes again, you will beat him, right? Definitely, sir! I can't beat him. That's why. Three people trust me at home. Three hundred people trust me in my office. This idiot has made up his mind! What do you want to say? If you are fired, then I will be a hero. If you quit, then you'll be a hero. I want to see the hero in you. Running a diaper company is not enough. You should have the courage to not want to wear it so often. Coward fellow. Coward. Fold it and keep it inside. It's okay. He has only scolded me. During the prospective match, Dad said he wanted a grand wedding. He said this all of a sudden, so I'm not sure if you're prepared. If you don't mind, I'd like to help you with it, without letting my parents know. Oh, no! It's okay. My son has made all the arrangements. It's our responsibility to organize a grand wedding. Yes. -Oh, it's done? So I'll take your leave. -Alright. -Bye. -Good. Alright See you. All good? I don't know. I told him that we will have a grand wedding. My boss gave me a send-off from the office in a grand manner -Why? -I lost my job. -What do we do now? -What do we do? We do nothing. My manager said that currently there's no job opening. Even if there are any, they'd need a salary slip of six months-- Stop the nonsense and give any solution if you have. If you get a job within a month and if the salary is credited to your account, only then can a loan be sanctioned. Brother, without any job, a loan of ten lakhs is difficult. Finding a job within 30 days is tough. Sir, it will be nice if Anand succeeds you as the CEO. Sanjay, Anand never wanted to become the CEO. Don't try new things now. To make my son the CEO, he sent him to America for his MBA. Brother, isn't that so? That means Anand-- Uncle, Vikram will become the CEO of our company. When is he returning from America? Let my brother say yes, he will be here tomorrow morning. How is that girl? She is very good. She is beautiful. Shall I talk to her father? What do you say? -Father. -Son! -I have only two months. -He didn't take his tablets. Shall I leave without seeing your marriage? It's not that father. Your birthday is coming up in 30 days. By that time, we need to give 1000 jobs at our Vizag factory. Seeing the happiness of those 1000 families is your birthday gift. We will talk after that. Your wish. Father, take your tablets. Thousand jobs in 30 days? Impossible! Hello. First time? -Yes, sir. -So many times. Why don't they talk after they call you? Hello? Brother, I have come to the coffee shop to meet your brother-in-law. If you keep meeting him before marriage thenâ€¦ -Sorry, brother! Sorry, sorry. -Hello, brother? If you keep meeting him before marriage, then at the time of marriage, we'll have to make settlements. Why did you go alone? Brother, I came along with my friend. I called you thinking that you would also join us. I have come for an interview. I'll come after it's done. -Oh, okay. -Cut the call. Cut it. Why were you terminated from your previous job? Excuse me, sir! -Hello! Brother! -I'm still in an interview. Didn't I tell you I will come after it's over? -Mister! -Sister! Why were you terminated from your previous job? Sorry, sir. I will switch it off. This is why you were terminated from your previous job! Sir, you should quit HR and become a detective. You'll have a bright future. Stop staring! Give me my rÃ©sumÃ©! You and your stupid job! Get lost! Where is he? Subbuâ€¦ where is Subha? -I am Subbu's friend. -Oh! I had stopped the car to give food packets to the elderly and they started teasing me. I wanted to call my dad, but Subbu's phone and mine got exchanged. Okay. I will leave. You guys carry on. -Bye. -Bye. Oh! I checked the dial list and saw a name saved as brother. I thought there wouldn't be any problem and you would come to save me. So, I was the one who messaged you. So, you messaged me, "Brother, I'm in trouble." Bro! I don't have any relationship with this girl. You can continue. What are you saying? I'm not related to her. It's your wish. Why are you leaving? What about you? What's your height? What about your physique? What's your color? Can you call me your brother? In that sense, can you call anyone in this world your brother? For this reason, you will leave me and go? From the same number if you message, "Cutie, I'm in trouble. Come and save me." And send the same location, then I will think! Hello! What? Are you trying to be a hero? Do you have it in you? To show you, I have it. But, do you? Do you know that you are talking to a hero? Hey, who gave my dialogue to him? -Are you messaging me or not? -No. Hey, I won't come your way this time. Do as you, please. Hello! Hello! -Hey, he won't come our way. -Hello! Shall we proceed? Cutie, I'm in trouble. Please come and save me. I won't come. I am hurt. Please, my cutie! My sweetie! Save me, baby! PLEASE, MY CUTIE! MY SWEETIE! SAVE ME, BABY! Hey, who are you? What do you do? Where did you come from? Hey, I have come from an interview. What's your interview about? Hey, do you know who I am? Do you know how many are there behind me? Not even one. Everyone left. Leave it! Do you know who will come, if you hit me? An ambulance, with a driver. Hey, is it a joke for you? It will not stop with one. If you touch me, then Begumpet Basha will be here. If Basha comes here, then it will be somethingâ€¦ -What if I beat up Basha? -What? You will beat up Basha? You will beat up Bashaâ€¦ Basha is a big goon. Answer my question. If I beat up Basha then who will show up? If you beat up Basha then Shaikpet Sharif will be here. Do you know Sharif is a bodybuilder? Oh! If I beat up Shaikpet Sharif then who will show up? What? You will beat up Shaikpet Sharif? You will beat up Shaikpetâ€¦ Sharif? -What? Shaikpet Sharif? -Hey, hey, hey! Don't get so excited. Tell me who will show up if I beat up Shaikpet Sharif? If you beat up Sharif, then Malakpet Mallesh will be here. He's the biggest goon in this city! Then come, let's go. Did you see, darling? He's scared of my brother's name. What I meant was, why beat up all of them? Let's directly go to Mallesh and beat him up. Hey! Greetings brother. Darling, sit down. Brother, what do you want? Tell me. I need to beat up someone. You've come while I'm eating and asked to beat up someone. I can beat anyone. Who do you want to thrash? Brother, I need to beat you up. Brother has cracked a joke. No, not at all. I have to beat you up. Why me? He misbehaved with my lady. If he's misbehaving with your lady, then go and beat him up. What do I've to do with it? Thrash him if you want! He said, If I beat him up then Begumpet Basha will come to his rescue. If you have the guts, then go and beat up Begumpet Basha. If I beat that Basha then Shaikpet Sharif will come to his rescue. If you're a real man then go and beat that Shaikpet Sharif. I've been told, If I beat him then Malakpet Mallesh will show up. If you are a hero, then go and beat that Malakpet Mallesh! Brother, that's why I'm here. Hey, everyone says that I'm crazy. But you look like a young prince from a crazy kingdom. Brother, I have to beat you up. I'm dealing with you like a kid and you're fooling around. Bodybuilders! They are my followers. If you have the guts, beat them up. Not me! Them! -Brother, I won't beat them up. -Are you scared? I'm here only to beat you up! I'll only fight you! Heyâ€¦ finish him by the time I finish eating my food. -Oh! -Hey! Hey! Don't mistake a lion's silence for its weakness. Once it turns violentâ€¦ And after thatâ€¦ What are you thinking? Finish your dialogue! With a face like that, an incomplete warning itself is more than enough. Why should I waste the whole thing on you? -Mallu, shall I go? -Go! -Hey, why are you shouting? -Please, don't come again. Leave. Darling, where is he? Has he left? -Yes. -Let's go! Hello! Hello! I talking to you. Why did you beat them up, when it was someone else who teased me? If the girl, we are interested in is facing a problem, then we must ensure that the problem doesn't reoccur. -Interest? -What's your name? Pranavi! Pranavi baby, I love you so much. Do you say love you to everyone after asking their name? In an arranged marriage, you can marry after asking for their name. I shouldn't say I love you? You might wonder why you should consider me. So let me tell you about myself My name is Swami. I had a job earlier but lost it recently. Well, I don't claim to be a very pious man. But it's okay I'm a good man. Like other guys, I won't say that I haven't loved anyone before. I won't even say that when I first saw you, I heard the love bells ring. Three years ago, I was deeply in love with a girl. But that girl married a richer man than me and left. Bad luck. I don't have any bad habits. At night, I have two pegs and two cigarettes when I'm feeling low. -Do you have any habits? -Damn! Thank God! How dare you? 1800 sq. ft. house, 21 inches TV, a single-door fridge, and a two-wheeler. All this is in your in-law's house. Oh! So we're discussing my in-law's house already? Not just about your in-law's house! I have even thought about the stage where we will have two kids and there will be two folds around your waist. I will wake you up in the morning and we'll go for a jog and a walk. So think carefully and give your decision about our marriage to my sister. Okay, darling? Quickly go to your house. And quickly come back to my mine. -Huh? -Yes! Don't think too much. Enough now. Go home. Finally, we met after so many days. The other day, you spoke so well. You have progressed step by step but I'm not like you. I want to grow by taking shortcuts. It's not possible to build a step every time, right? That's whyâ€¦ in the next five years, whichever company is on the top I want to occupy that. I never thought of occupying your company. But when you said that you will die in two monthsâ€¦ If I like anything then I give four options to the people on the other side. One. If given whatever is asked for then it's a donation. Two. If taken whatever is asked then it's business. Three. If you hit and snatch it then it's tyranny. Four. Occupying by killing, which is the rule of the jungle. That is politics. Intelligent people will select and settle with the first two options. So, let's come back to the first option. I wantâ€¦ your company. To buy this company, I'm giving you an offer. Hey, I don't think this is a bad number. I'm not for sale! For a lion, there's only one rule. If a lion is hungry, it hunts. If a lion is hungryâ€¦ it hunts. I'm hungry. Be ready to faceâ€¦ the other two options. The other day, you said something. "I'm living successfully, I want to die successfully." Right? You might be living successfullyâ€¦ but you are not going to die successfully. You will have to deal with me in order to get there. We will meet again. -Sir, that-- -Anand shouldn't know about this. I don't want him to be dragged into this. Dear, what are you getting ready for? Dad is taking me out somewhere. He asked me to get ready. Oh! I need to tell you something. -What is it? -Come, I'll tell you. What is it? Yesterday, a guy proposed to me. Is my son-in-law handsome or average-looking? He's very handsome. Is my son-in-law a softie or a rebel? He's a rebel. Is my son-in-law innocent or mature? He's mature. Is my son-in-law well settled or struggling? I don't know. Wait, why do you address him as your son-in-law? It is evident that you also like him, or else you would have objected at the very first instance I addressed him as that. But do note that your father will accept him as son-in-law only if he's settled. Or else he won't budge at all. Mom, I know that Dad isn't a villain. I have been married to him for the past 25 years. Don't you think I know whether he's a hero or a villain? -Dear, Pranavi! -Go, he's calling you. Shall we go, dear? You look like Goddess Mahalakshmi! No wonder she takes after me! To avoid ambiguity, please specify if she resembles Goddess Mahalakshmi or you. You're a driver. Better behave like one. You too, better behave like an owner. Sir, I like you as you don't treat me like a servant. -Shall we go -Dad, where are we headed to? Surprise! Come on, it's a surprise. Let's go. One fine day, she will shock you by giving you a "surprise" as well! -Where have you brought me, Dad? -To see a prospective bridegroom. -Huh? -Yes! I have finalized an extraordinary guy. We're here as he wanted to talk to you. How can you finalize him without asking me? That's why it's a surprise! Would you accept if your daughter brings some guy to surprise you? I'm sparing you only because luck has favored me since you joined. I'm scared that if I quit, you might abandon everything and start living the life of an ascetic. I'll kill you. You might be able to scare him with your threats. Shut up! -Get lost. Wait in the car. -Ensure that you don't get bankrupt. Hey! I chose a guy based on your preferences. Share your opinion after talking to him. Come, come, comeâ€¦ There he is. I know your heart Yes, you know I know you like him Yes, you know Come. Come on! Dear, come. Sir, greetings! Greetings! How are you? I am fine, sir. Hi! I and his father have been friends for a long time. And finally, you both have met. -You had planned this from the beginning? -Of course, we did. You guys talk to each other -while I wait for you. -Okay. -Oh! -Carry on. Do you work in this office? -Yeah! -Okay. It's exciting when friends become family. Friends, familyâ€¦ Aah! Yes! Correct! Did you know me, when we met earlier? I'm meeting after gathering all the details. What else do you know? Ladakh is your favorite place. You love heights and are scared of water. You love chili fritters from Poorna Tiffin Center, Bahar's mutton biryani, and paya from Goa Niyaz. Bhanu is your best friend. You won't talk for at least four days if you're angry. You like clothes from Gucci and watches from Swarovski. Your favorite color is blue, and 3 Idiots is your favorite movie. Your favorite song is "Aamani Paadave Hayiga." A beautiful song. I am impressed. Apart from all thatâ€¦ Feeding the hungry gives you happiness and satisfaction. Is it enough or shall I continue? But how do you know all this? I'm a businessman and I get into something only after thorough research. Do you want to ask me about anything? I have collected all this information without your permission. However, I can't take your number without your consent. Just a second! -Yeah! -9603104762 Perfect! I'll text you. Dad! Did you like the girl, Anand? Almost. Should I speak to her father? No, Dad. Let's not rush things. She hasn't shared her opinion yet. Don't cause me another tension. Dad, I will marry her. Okay? -Momâ€¦ -What is it dear? I told you earlier about Swami, right? -Yes. -Dad has fixed my marriage with Swami. He has done thorough research about me. I liked him a lot. -Is it? -Hello, Priestâ€¦ My daughter's marriage is fixed with a guy. Find an auspicious time for the engagement. We can start preppingâ€¦ Didn't you call him a villain? What do you want to say now? Something's fishy. I too felt it was fishy. -Isn't it? -Nothing. Mom, you have misunderstood Dad. When you type love in the chat, it autocorrects to Dad. Do you know? This is the meaning of aâ€¦ father. -Oh! -Oh! One minute. -Hello. -I came to know that my Brother met you and he has thrashed somebody for you. And he has also proposed to you. -Yes. -Why didn't you tell me earlier? I should have informed you. Butâ€¦ Forget about me. Just tell him whether you accept or reject his proposal. He's anxious. I told him that I like him in the office earlier. How could you meet him in the office? He was fired a week ago. Isn't my father and your father friends? It looks like you're confused. He's anxious to know your answer. I have called you to ask whether I can share your number. Can I give your number to him? Alright, give him. Okay. Dad! -I'm wondering what to do with this money. -Dad, what's his name? Have you given your consent without knowing his name? He's Anand Chakravarthy. My name's Swami. What does he do? He's the future CEO of Peoples Mart company. I have been fired from my job recently. Hello Sir! I would like to open another account in SBI. I'm glad that you're marrying the guy, you like. I need to tell you something. I and Dad have met two different people. -Didn't you say they're the same? -They look the same. Huh? One of them is my friend's brother, Swami. Look. WHAT DECISION HAVE YOU TAKEN? The other one is Dad's friend's son Anand Chakravarthy. Oh, no! What have you done? What should I do now? -Earlier you said that you liked Swami. -Yes. -Now, you're saying that you like Anand. -Yes. -Does that mean you like them both? -Yes. -Do they also like you? -Yes. What am I supposed to do now? Travel with them and choose the one you like the most. -Let's think then. Okay? -Okay. I thought I will remain single And not fall in love Whatever happened to that? Beware of the boys, Dad used to warn Whatever happened to that? No sooner did I see him than I started liking him And didn't realize he was inside me Even beyond this pillow I couldn't think beyond him Girl, he disturbed the whole system What's happening? What's happening in my heart? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? I used to sleep at 10 pm Now I lie awake till 2 am because of him I dared not step beyond my room now I return home around 7 pm Even when I am skipping buddy's parties I charge my phone thrice a day Because I spend more time with him Than with myself all these years What's happening? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? What's happening? What's happening in my heart? Once I occupy something, I don't even share it with the owner. How did you think that I would share it with an outsider? I'm an Ex-MLA of Vizag. Nobody has survived once they opposed me. The whole of Vizag is under my control. The gun in my hand doesn't know that the opponent is an MLA. It doesn't even know there's an ex-MLA on the other side. What kind of bullet are you? Atharva, didn't he say that nobody survived if they opposed him? I wonder when will these MLAs stop lying. -Hello, Chakravarthy. -Yes? I have promised my son that I will gift him your company on his birthday. You should make it to my son's birthday. I mean, by stepping out of your company. Oh, by the way, I heard you are opening a new branch in Vizag. I thought I will take a small break until that branch is operational, so I can occupy the whole thing. Do remember that you will only be the company's CEOâ€¦ until the Vizag branch opens. I'm hungry. What's the status of the Vizag branch? Sir, there's a slight delay of one to two days. Sanjay, it will be best to increase the manpower and order extra equipment if you want. But I want the inaugural on time. Is that clear? Okay, sir. Have you decided between the two? I'm unable to decide, Mom. The one rejected by you will suffer ten times more than the one accepted by you. It's okay if you make him wait until you choose him. But if you want to reject someone, don't make him wait. Better go tomorrow and tell the one who you want to reject. Any woman who marries a man will only weigh two aspects. One is how they value you as a person. Two is how much their family loves you. Good morning everybody! I have realized that hunger is a problem that needs to be addressedâ€¦ through a friend who recently entered my life. One out of every seven in this world is sleeping with hunger. I'm unsure if I should feel happy that we don't belong to that category or worried that the remaining six aren't helping them. Many people want to donate food to the needy. But they don't know where to give. And someone hungry doesn't know where to find donors. This food bank will bring the needy and those willing to donate on a common platform. A small request for all of you. I urge you all to donate the leftover food from your parties, functions, and hotels to these food banks. From now on, let's share our love, not the leftovers. This applause and respect belong to my friend Pranaviâ€¦ who shared this idea with me. Any woman who marries a man will only weigh two aspects. One is how they value you as a person. She's sure to surprise her father. Pranavi? Come inside. Who is she? Our daughter's friend and our son'sâ€¦ Have you said "yes" to my son? Not yet. Have you come here to say yes? -Actuallyâ€¦ -Don't feel shy. Hey, don't tell him now. Let him run around you for some time, then you can tell him. -I will be back. -Huh? Oh, Mother, it's already delayed. I've already forgotten the post-marriage rituals. We need to revise the old syllabus if she yes. Stop it! Once you say yes to marrying my son. We'll need more time to get to know each other. So, I would suggest you stop delaying any further. Get to know each other? Shouldn't we also love you and accept you? Huh? Why will you love me? Love is to avoid any misunderstandings. And live harmoniously post-marriage. More than my son, we need to love each other. What about him? He wakes up in the morning and leaves for the office in an hour. Returns from office and retires to bed within two hours. At most he might spend three-four hours with you, post-marriage. Don't you think that we must have more understanding and love for each other, as we'll spend more time together? You must not feel that you're unable to gel well with your in-laws even if you and your husband are bonding well. We aren't sure when will you share your consent with our son. But we'll share it now! Love you so much, sweetie. I love you, sister-in-law. I love you, dear. I love you more, Pranavi baby! That's it. What's wrong with you? This house has more drama than the Bigg Boss house. I will see your end. Tell me. Everyone is praising the grandeur of your daughter's wedding. All praises for the wedding feast. Have you lost your mind? When did my daughter's marriage take place? Your daughter has hooked up with someone. She's outperforming the stars in TV soaps. If you don't pay attention now, then someone will call you to praise you for the wedding feast. Who's that? Do you want to verify his background, instead of killing him? I will ensure that his entire family is wiped out. Waiting! I'm gifting you the costliest saree my husband has gifted me. Do you know why? I wish it will come back to my wardrobe once you marry my son. Oh, no! Please take it and stay blessed. Two is how much the family loves you. Oh! Kisses! -I'm unable to bear it! -Yes! Yes! Please reserve some for us also. -Sir! -I don't need your salute. What is happening? Did you drag him out? What are you waiting for? Shoot him. -Blast the building! -Move! -Ensure that no one survives. -Sir, your daughter is inside. -Hold on, hold on! -Stop! Oh my God! My daughter is inside. Oh my God! My daughter is inside. -What are you waiting for? Announce it! -Yes, sir. Mr. Swami, handover Ramesh Reddy's daughter. Otherwise, we will open fire. Pranavi! Hey, Kill him! Dad! Don't shoot. Stop! Stop! Stop! Sir, you? Sir, why are you saluting the opponent? He's not an enemy. He's a great person who people like you can't comprehend. I assumed that my daughter is in Kukatpally. Instead, she is in a sacred place like Kashi. I haven't realized that she's at the feet of God Viswanath! Please forgive me! Please don't say that. I will get my daughter married to you right here, right now if you accept. Please! I haven't decided to marry her yet! She has informed me that she loves me. I was about to bring her to you saying that it's not correct. In the meantime, you have come. Sir, she wants to marry you. Please say yes, sir. Please forgive me, Mr. Ramesh Reddy I can't marry until my sister is married. I can't neglect my duties and responsibilities. Please take her. Do you have a sister? How would you know if he has a sister or not? -May I know, who you are? -His father. But, you're not his father, right? How can you decide who is his father? What's your name? Did you come here without knowing my name? -Swami. -What do you do? I have been fired from my job. I'm roaming carelessly. What do you do? He has a daughter, so he roams like a fool. Come. Hey, catch! -Oh! He grabbed it. -Exactly. Wrist band! The dude who has the most fab wristband And handkerchief, Hey girl? Hey, those creaking sounds Of the marching Kinnera singers Belong to that rustic guy is it? The dude who has the most fab wristband And handkerchief, Hey girl? Hey, those creaking sounds Of the marching Kinnera singers Belong to that rustic guy is it? Gifting me an anklet Or ensnaring me with those bangles Hug me like a nose-ring, Or plant kisses as your imprint Or come like a festival And grab the feast of beauty The most fab wristband and handkerchief The dude who has the most fab wristband And handkerchief, Hey dear! Hey, those creaking sounds Of the marching Kinnera singers Belong to that rustic guy is it? Your piercing looks chiming with my cheeks Come let's smell the flowers And break the bed The space of your anklets Is what this landlord thirsts for Let me sow my seeds In your territory now! The whole expanse is yours From here to there Look not, hither thither And take a grand view Tell me not to stop, my darling! The manliness in me Makes me not take a breath! The most fab wristband and handkerchief The dude who has the most fab wristband And handkerchief, Hey dear! Hey, those creaking sounds Of the marching Kinnera singers Belong to that rustic guy is it? -Let's march into the woods -Let's march into the woods -The jaggery from Dead Sea apple -The jaggery from Dead Sea apple -Which you gave to the fox instead of me -Which you gave to the fox instead of me -That jaggery got stuck in its jaw -That jaggery got stuck in its jaw And the fox thawed it out All the way to the village And the fox thawed it out All the way to the village -That's when we all woke up -That's when we all woke up And saw a flowery purse in the garden And a lovely blouse Next to the flowery purse This flower is for you Handle me delicately Plant the umbrella In the middle of your vast chest! And I will hang by Your side like a coat-tail And fill your heart with moonshine! Will you guard vigil like a parakeet? Or watch me like a rattle on the well? Forget all that familiar chatter I can plant A pebble in your midriff and hit it hard! The most fab wristband and handkerchief The dude who has the most fab wristband And handkerchief, Hey dear! Hey, those creaking sounds Of the marching Kinnera singers Belong to that rustic guy is it? The joy a dad gets when his son gets a job is the same joy you all are experiencing right now. But my joy knows no bounds when my son said he has given jobs to 1000 people. But my real birthday gift is not these 1000 jobs, but the joy to 1000 families, or rather the ownership bestowed on 1000 family members. Welcome to the family of People Mart. And on this happy note, I would like to announce that People Mart will have its new CEO from the 1st of April. Anand, JP met me a few days back. Dad, are you afraid of him? You don't know him well enough. Dad, I will speak to JP. He won't listen to anyone once he sets his sights on something. It's okay, Dad, we both know of someone who can deal with this issue. Shall we? Mom! I decided that Swami is the right choice for me. Anand is coming here now. I'll tell him my deci
