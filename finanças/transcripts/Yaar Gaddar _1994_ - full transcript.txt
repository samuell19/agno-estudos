Turn the car around. Okay? You, Lakdhawala? Chunawala. Right code word. It is very difficult to conduct business with you. I have been trying to supply goods to you for the past six months. Before doing business, we inquire about the person as well as the goods. Show me the goods. The goods are on the way. You show me the currency. The currency is also on the way. Good. That fat guy is speaking exactly like the smugglers. They don't know that we are police officers. The plan is successful. I shall inform Sir. The quality is very good. Why haven't your goods arrived yet? It's already here. Look over there. Above you. I really enjoyed doing business with you. Vijay, open the bonnet. Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Open it. What happened? He will not be able to open the bonnet. There are handcuffs on his hands. Put your guns down and put your hands up! Don't move, inspector. If we die, then we shall take you along with us. Well, I am not fond of living either. Let's make the final journey along with you. If you were to show me your faces then it would be easier to recognize each other on our way to hell. After all, we all have to go to the same place. Right? Sir, Anil, Vijay and Majit. They have killed everyone. They are all dead, sir. Hey, rascals! Allow me to pick up the pistol at least. He is cheating. You scum! Now I shall teach them a lesson. Who teaches these imbeciles? -You are okay, right? -I am fine. They have all run away. If I had gotten a hold of them then I would have killed them. Ambulance. Hospital! Hospital! Let's go. The minister is here. Hurry up! Come. Welcome, sir. Welcome to the bank. Come, Mr. Ragunath. -Let's go. -Please sir. In this bank, not only famous rich bureaucrats deposit their money, but the jewelry and the money of the famous Goddess temple is also deposited over here. The public has deposited up to four or five crore rupees in our bank. Safe and secure. -Oh! I see. -Please. Come this way. These are the bank vaults. There are cameras on every corner. Every person who comes in or goes out, his photo is clicked. This is the control panel that prepares a special type of red-colored ultrasonic rays. Without turning off this system, trying to cross it means death. Hey! It has vanished. Hey! This is a very dangerous arrangement, Khanna. Don't worry. I will switch it off. -Hey! This is amazing, minister sir. -Yes, come. And in all this computerized security system there are four specialized people. Until all four of them don't enter their computer codes one after the other, the vault doesn't open until then. Wow! This is a very fabulous thing. But Khanna, tell me something. I am not well educated, but I know at least this much, that if one of the four men falls sick, what happens then? Then I am there, right? I have everybody's computer codes. -Really? -Yes. Raghunath, you are one of Khanna's closest friends. Are you seeing all these arrangements for the first time? -Yes. -This is all confidential, sir. The friendship is in its place and the duty is in its place. Very good. You may leave. Khanna... This box contains the money, which I had spoken to you about. 500 crores. And Minister sir wishes to keep all this money here until the next election. I have understood, sir. You don't worry at all. Your money and your words are with me. Safe and secure. Come, my darling. Come. -Raghu darling. -Darling! No. You are very desperate. Let me breathe at least. It has been three months since I have known you. Since then I have been breathing. You did not allow me to do anything until today. -At least let me kiss you once today. -No. No. Let us speak about work. Whatever I had said, has proved to be the truth, right? The meaning of crossing the security system of the bank is death. I am not well educated, but I know at least this much... that I have contacts with such brilliant people. who will wipe out all the money from Laxmi bank. -And they won't even leave any evidence. -Yes. Who are they? General Raghuvansh. Colonel Biswas. Commander Mushtaq. They have all retired but they are very active. Who could guess that these three terrorists are also respected citizens of this society? You have praised us a lot, minister. Tell me why you are here? I am not well educated, but I know at least this much... that you will be amazed to hear about it. We have to steal the Laxmi bank. -What? -Is it a joke to steal from Laxmi bank? Hey! I know it. I know it very well. That is why, I have come to the masters. Right, Sheela? Yes. Chairman Jagdish Khanna. The person who is the key to that bank he is a lover, trapped in my plan. If you are interested, then I shall explain the scheme further. But I have to tell you that if there are five players then there will be five shares. We will be out in the action. What if one of us gets killed? Then there will be four players and four shares. I agree. Tell me. Great! On the 26th, there is a silver jubilee function of the Laxmi bank. After the function, Khanna will leave for abroad. The night when he leaves we will do our work on. Where and how? I will tell you when the correct time comes. What are you thinking about? I can't help but wonder, if these three guys can be trusted to keep their word. Hey! Why are you afraid, my darling? I would not spare my own child for so much money. And these are just our associates. And we are betrayers by birth and caste. Sir, whose house is this? Lock the car and leave. Sir, what will I do after going home? My wife is not at home. I will do my duty. I will earn some money. There is no need. Give me the keys. Leave. It is the bank's money. If I had earned some overtime what would he lose? Let me see, who does he come to meet? -Sheela darling. -Hello darling! I am over here. The inquiry has started in the bank. I am sick and tired of answering their questions all day. Relax, darling. I will make your stress disappear. Oh! So this is the matter. Darling, I am making a drink. -You come upstairs. -I will come, dear. Bring the drink over here only. Give me a massage. Now it will be real fun. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Laxmi bank musical competition. The prize money is one lakh rupees. The forms are available from nine o'clock in the morning. The closing date is 20th November. -Let's go. Let's go. -Are you crazy? Every struggling actor, singer and dancer will be there. We will not be successful over there. We will take at least two or four days in the line to get the form. And we will take another eight to ten days to submit the form. Yes. But why should we bother about all this? He will think about all this. Our master, Ilu the Elvis. Jai Kumar. -Hey! Hurry up! -Don't worry. Have patience. Ilu, the meaning of standing in the line and submitting the form will take you Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Which means that half the week is already over. After that, selections, rehearsals, reviews, previews, competition. In all, it is a matter of many months, my dear. Forget about one lakh rupees. Don't worry, child. Ilu means Elvis, the King. Witness my power. And my style. What nonsense? They are such imbeciles. -What happened? -What happened? They told me that they will give me the form but they will take something in return. What will they take? You rascal! Don't you understand anything? What people? We should throw them all in the gutter. What happened? They are asking for ten thousand rupees along with a form. -Ten thousand! -Such a large amount? This is manipulation... Do you mean black money is in circulation? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Come on, let's run away from here. -Come on, let's move from here. -Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. -Come on. Come on. -Come on. Come on. What happened? Where are you all going? -Why me? -Get lost. Why are you hitting me? Did you see the miracle of Ilu, the great? Excuse me. I want to submit the form. -Sorry. Lunchtime. -But it is only eleven o'clock now. But these are the timings that our bank follows. Madam, there is only one form. Please take it, please. Okay. -Yes! -Has she taken it? Where are your ten thousand rupees? -Ten thousand! -Yes. Yes. Ten thousand rupees. Don't you have it? Then come back tomorrow. Okay? Hey! But madam... -Master Ilu, the miracle has failed. -Ten thousand rupees in the bank! Lunchtime! Yes, who are you? What's your problem? Sir, a stupid man who looked like a music director was screaming for no reason. He was saying, "What do these people think?" "That they can buy art with money?" They will give 10,000 rupees and earn lakhs of rupees. I will not only teach him a lesson, but also remind him about his background. Sir, first submit my form, please. What is the matter? What happened? Where are you all going? What else, idiot? You have closed the counter at eleven o'clock. And on top of that, you are committing fraud. Get lost! This is false. This is wrong. Believe me. This is the enemy's plan to turn our big-show into a flop-show. Did you understand anything, Bhalu? There is somebody who is smarter than us. Sir. He... -Come on, guys. -Yes, let's go. Let's go. Sir, that is the person who was talking about buying art. The person who has disturbed our program. Sir, please make him leave. Please sir. Please. Hey! Hey! Hey! What is this entire nuisance, unnecessarily? Tell me. Tell me. Why don't you say something? -Why don't you say? -Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Now submit my form without any further ado, Or else, for deceiving us and-- He is calling you a fraud and a deceiver. You say that I am a fraud? I am a deceiver? Yes! And this girl is also involved with you. Hey! You imbecile! Now I will teach you a lesson. -Police! -Who called out to us? I keep on calling out to you every day. You never pay attention to me. And you listen to everybody who passes by on the roads. Madam, we are not husband and wife now. Concentrate on your duty. -Oh! Fine. -Let's go. Okay. Brother. Sister-in-law. I am a very cunning girl. Now watch how I trap you in your own plan and kill you. What is the matter? What is the matter? What is the matter? This stupid goon is trying to molest me. Manager sir. He called me a fraud, unnecessarily. He called me a cheat. Then you must be a fraud and a cheat. Whatever he says is right. Do you know who he is? He is our inspector Shankar Verma's brother. Give me your form. I shall fill it myself. Take this. Miss Cunning woman, now I shall get into your house. Bloody fool! Murli. Murli. Hey Murli, where have you been? It is time for Shankar to come home. -Quickly serve the food. -Song? If I knew how to sing a song then wouldn't I have joined the film industry? You joke very well. -Hello. -Hello. I am commissioner Rawat speaking. -Greetings, brother! -Greetings, sister! I have called you up, because right now, your younger son Jai, is in police custody. -Jai! What are you saying? -I am absolutely right. -Your younger son has robbed. -Robbed! No. No. My Jai cannot do this. -Oh my God! -And it is not an ordinary theft. He has robbed a jewelry store. -He says that Jai has robbed a place. -What? -Just see. -Hello. Stealing, killing people. He has not only betrayed the police. -He has tried to fool them. -What happened? And I am afraid sister, that I cannot help you at all in this matter. Nobody can do anything. Your son Shankar-- Just a second. Brother Shankar, actually... I will not spare you today. -You keep fooling around all the time. -No! Mother, save me! You cause trouble even when you're not in jail. We should really hit him thoroughly. He is very naughty! -He lies! -Hit him! Hit him! No. No. Brother, no. It is enough! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. -Please forgive me. -Let go of me. Let go of me. Hey! What is this, brother? You always reveal my secrets. -Shut up! -Child, I have served food. Come and have food. Let's go eat. Fooling around all the time. I have brought the IPS form. Fill it up. And make the arrangements for the examination. This means that I too should become a government servant like you. No brother. If I become something, then I will become a millionaire or a billionaire. Nowadays, there is no value of a person who owns lakhs of rupees. Is this the way to earn money? If you help permit someone's license then you earn a commission. You will clear out somebody's house and you will earn money for a fortnight. Hey! Have you ever thought about whose son you are? Whose grandson you are? There is so much respect for our family. I love our family reputation just as much as you do. But this respect cannot help us paint the walls of this house. All these medals that you have won, all of them together... cannot repair the wrecked ceiling of our house. Just look into your heart and try to remember... that due to the lack of money... your love, your Shashi left you and went away forever. Shankar has done everything for this household. For you. For that Shashi. He wanted to make Shashi the daughter-in-law of this house. She broke my son's heart and left. And you... Go and apologize to your brother. Brother. I am sorry. Please forgive me. If you find a person, with a face similar to the faces in these photographs in any form, anywhere then arrest them immediately. Yes. You don't worry, sir. To get a hold of these people is pretty simple for me. It is pretty simple for her. -May I come in, sir? -Yes. Please come. I am the chairman of Laxmi bank, Jagdish Khanna. Yes, sit down. What can I do for you? This is my driver Roop Singh's wife. Greetings! Last Saturday, after ten o'clock in the night the driver did his duty and went away. He has been missing since then. Can you please help us. Take her statement and file a report. -Yes. Please come. -We will inform you... as soon as we have any information. Thank you. I will be obliged. This poor woman has young kids. She is very worried. -We will do our best. -Thank you. Welcome friends! I welcome you all to the first round of Laxmi bank musical competition. As you all know that among the twenty-five semifinalists two final teams will be selected. Which two teams will enter the finals... this decision will be taken by our judge Mr. Mulchand who himself is a very famous singer. Get aside, you fatty! Come on, girls. Master. Master, I have seen her rehearsals. She is truly creating magic. I merely hope that she doesn't blow up our fuse. Before our fuse can be switched off... we will have to short-circuit them. Judge Mulchand! -Come, sir. Come. -Welcome, sir. Welcome! -I am the manager over here and he... -Thank you. Thank you. Where is this hall? Come sir, come. -The hall is over there. -Really? -Please come. -Is the hall over there? Please come, sir. Please come. Sir, actually in order to participate in the finals all the groups are getting ready. -Who is getting ready? -The groups, sir. -You take some rest until then. -Hey! I keep on resting. Along with that, there is an arrangement for eatables too. Really! Fried veggies. Sweets. Ice-creams. And many other things. So if I have to go somewhere then where should I go? Over here. Hey! What is this? -Toilet! -Open the door! Come, Mr. Mulchand. -Fried veggies! -Cottage cheese rolls! Sweets! I am so hungry. Come. Come. Come on, let's go. Stop it! What are you doing, damsel! Excellent face. Excellent figure. -But... -But? But what? But it is impossible for you to win the dance competition, my dear. Why sir? Am I not dancing well? You dance very well. You dance very well. But not of the MTV standard. But don't worry, baby. I will teach you. You don't have to think. You have to learn. You don't have to lose but you have to win. And I will do it because I have liked you. Tomorrow you come to my Hi-Fi dance classes. Thank you, sir. I shall never forget this favor all my life. Not at all. Amazing! Where are your classes, sir? Fantasy open-air theatre. 4:00 in the evening. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. -Stop! Mangesh, idiot! -Sorry sir. How many times have I told you that nothing -will happen -Sorry sir. I made a mistake. if you merely move like a pendulum? -Please forgive me. -Get out, Mangesh. -Greetings sir! -Who are you? Hey! How did you dare to come to my classes without my permission? Hey! How did you dare to greet me without my permission? Sir, I was here for that competition. Competition? -Yes. -With me? Hey! There is no competition for me in this entire world. -Get out! -Boys, get back to work. Sir, I had come to learn it, sir. Sir, you told me that you would teach me how to dance. Oh! Amrapali! Beautiful girl! She will dance in the competition. And she will win because I will make her win. You idiot! Not like this. Do it properly. Which dance forms do you know? Sir, I know all types of dances. Twist, Bhangra, Ramba-samba. Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi. What about Bhel-puri? Ragda-patties? What, sir? Forget it. Forget everything. Just look at me. Whatever I will do, do that on the stage. And you will win the first prize. You will definitely win. Come on, girls.

I have brought my rat" "Where is your cheese?" "This girl is crazy She makes different noises" By the time we find these terrorists I would have lost all of my beauty. Oh my God! It is so hot! -What? Are you feeling hot? -Yes. By the time I explain this to you, my intelligence, and my youth will both fade away. Madam, we are on duty. We are on duty, madam. -Forget about the duty. -Everybody is looking at us. -Everybody is looking at us, madam. -And look at me, Santu. Santu, my dear, look at me. -Santu. Santu, my dear. -Priest. Save me. Priest. -Priest. Priest. Priest. Priest. -Santu! -Priest. Priest. Priest. -May you progress, my child! Kalyan, Karjat or Pune. Anywhere will do. I am sick of doing her duty. Day and night have become one. One night, this Santram will be dead, priest. Why are you pleading in front of them? You are my husband. Mine. How will he save you? A beard is the only difference I see between these criminals and these priests. Alakh Niranjan! Wow! You have kept a very dashing name. He is Alakh. You are Niranjan. Then who is this third guy? Amritanjan. Insult! It is a very big insult of the priests. Hey madam! They are priests not Santram that you are insulting them so much. Shut up! -What is below the beard? -Hey! What is below the shawl? -Open up your beard. -Insult. Grave insult! I will teach you a lesson, Amritanjan. I will hit you all so badly that I will teach you all a good lesson. Santram, leave me! You foolish woman! Your body is of a human... but your activities are like an animal. Hey! Shut up! Here, this Bhutanand priest curses you... that you will become a dog. You will become a dog. Alakh Niranjan! Alakh Niranjan! Alakh Niranjan! Alakh Niranjan! Alakh Niranjan! Dear, you were turned into a dog? What did you do, priest? Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest! Pushpi, how many times have I told you not to get involved in unwanted fights! Now what will happen to you and what will happen to me? What will we do? How will we survive? Priest! O Lord! Which revenge are you taking from me by converting my Pushpi into a dog? Come on, get lost. Now I have to knead the dough. I have to make the Rotis. And I have to play the flute. What should I do, Lord? What should I do? Come. Come over here. Sit down. I don't even know whether I should add water in the flour or flour in the water? Hey! What are you doing? I just asked you. Why are you getting angry? Shouldn't I even prepare the Roti now? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey! Now will you knead the dough? How will you roll them? How will you roll them? Give it to me. How will you roll them? Hey Pushpi! What are you doing? Hey Pushpi! If you knead the dough this way then who will eat these Rotis? Priest, make me a dog too. The dog and the bitch will together eat Rotis. Enough! Enough! Enough! Why are you barking? I am sorry. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You always keep on getting bugged. You keep on barking for no reason at all. You always get on my nerves. -Shut up! -Come here. -What happened? -Please, Pushpi! If I eat this food then do you know that I will keep puking for seven days? I will die. Come on, I will not speak to you. You keep on barking for no reason at all. -Hey Santram! -Come. Please come. Why are you talking to this dog like a crazy person? Hey! I am not mad. This is my wife. Is this dog your wife? Pushpa? Where is Pushpa? Hey! I think that Pushpa must have become fed up of his craziness and ran away somewhere. No! Pushpa has not run away. This is Pushpa. He is lying. He must have killed her for dowry. Yes. Yes. Take him to the police station. -Take him to the police station. -Take him to the police station. -Take him. -Take him. Hey! That's not true. Listen to me. Listen to me. Hey Pushpi! Explain to them. No. No. No. Listen to me at least. Pushpi, before they imprison me for the crime of your death we will have to search for that priest. Where will we find him? Where? Priest. Pushpi, come. Come. Come and sit on my lap. Come and sit on my lap. You have given a very good lesson of my love. You have rubbed flour on your lover's face. Who will make the Roti's, Pushpi? Are you trying to dress up a dog? You will be suspended. Then don't come to me. -What is the problem? -Nothing, sir. I cannot tell you about my problem even if I want to. -Why? -Take this. You want a very long vacation. And that too along with your wife. Do you intend to spend another honeymoon with your wife? Even if I had that intention I would not be able to act upon it. The situation is very uncertain. These people have established a new world record by riding on the motorcycle. What is the matter? Your dog is barking a lot. The chief guest of this competition ex-general Raghuvansh Singh, had introduced this game in India earlier and named it star formation. He presented the medals to the team himself. Ex-general Raghuvansh Singh. The owner of Star club. "You, you, you, you" "It's you and only You are my life" "It's you and only you Who are all my relationships" "In every breath, in my Every heartbeat, you are present" "In every breath, in my Every heartbeat, you are present" "If you are not there Then I don't have anything" "It's you and only You are my life" "It's you and only you Who are all my relationships" "In every breath, in my Every heartbeat, you are present" "In every breath, in my Every heartbeat, you are present" "If you are not there Then I don't have anything" "It's you and only You are my life" "You, you, you, you" "I know this" "I am aware That you are my savior" "You are my Almighty" "I know this" "I am aware about this" "You are my destination" "You are only my companion" "You are only my destination" "You are only my companion" "It's you and only You are my life" "It's you and only you Who are all my relationships" "You, you, you, you" "You will not go away by being Attracted to me in this way" "You will not go away By belonging to me" "I will decorate your Forehead with the stars" "I swear by my love, darling That I will make you my bride" "I swear by my love, darling That I will make you my bride" "It's you and only You are my life" "It's you and only you Who are all my relationships" "In every breath, in Every heartbeat, you are present" "In every breath, in Every heartbeat, you are present" "If you are not there Then I don't have anything" "If you are not there Then I don't have anything" So, did you like it? Yes. Raghuvansh Singh, the partner of this club. Oh! I am inspector Shankar Verma. You're the reason I came here. -Me? -I need some information about star. For a case I am working on. -About this club of mine? -No. About the star formation. A few days ago, there was a motorcycle show that took place... You were the chief guest. Yes. Yes. Yes. Of course. Ask me. Come. When you were in the army... you used to do this show yourself, didn't you? Of course. I was the first man in India to perform these stunts. And you won medals for it. At that time, you had two associates with you. Where are they presently? Inspector sir, I don't know how many shows I have performed. How many associates I had... I don't know who might be where today? Hey Sweety! Come here. Now I have this club. And there is only enjoyment everywhere. This is Sweety. The life of my club. I will leave now. Why are you in such a hurry, inspector? This was just an ordinary show. If you wish then shall I perform a personal show? We do not prefer to watch the personal shows of cheap women like you, who strip off and dance to the sound of clinging coins. Only a woman can understand this. Not a whore like you. Poor fellow! How would I tell you about all that I have been through? Here sister. Have some food. The doctors say that if your father is not operated upon... -then your father... -No, mother. No. Nothing will happen to father. I will eat it later. Where are you going now? To Shankar? What will that poor guy do? He has done so much for us already. And this is not a matter of a thousand or two. I know, mother. But I can do anything for father's life. What will you do? You have already taken up all the responsibility of this house. You take tuitions throughout the day. You don't have time to eat food or to go to sleep. You have killed your emotions and your desires, you have ruined your life for all of us. Father, please. Have some rest. I will arrange the money any way I can. You will not do anything. You will not do anything! You will not do anything. The person whose destiny becomes his enemy, nobody can do anything for him. -Father! -Nothing... These doctors... These doctors lie! When they say an operation can restore my health. No. No. Before dying, I cannot pressurize you all... with the burden of debt. Stop talking! You need rest. Everything will be all right. Everything will be all right. Let go of the light of hope, Shashi's mother. -Wipe out this vermilion. -No! No! -Father! -Break these bangles. -No. -Father! Your hope will live on as long as you wear them. -Break them. Break them. -No. No. -What are you saying? -Papa, please. What is wrong with you? Father! Father! Hey Sweety! How are you? Sir, the money that you had promised me, please give it. -Please sir. Sir, I have to go home. -Yes. Take this. Pick it up. Hey girl! Dance! What? Come on. Dance. -Come on, Sweety. Dance. -Sir, please. -Sir I have to go home. -Dance. -Sir, my mother is waiting for me. -Come on, dance. -Sir, please. -One. Two. Three. Four. -Sir, please. Please. -Dance. I am very rarely in a good mood. Dance. Dance. Dance. -Hey! Come on, dance with me. -No. -Let's dance together. -No. Come on, let's dance together. -Come on. Dance. -No. No. -Let go of me. Let go of me. -Dance with me. Come on. Yeah! Dance with me. Dance with me. Yeah! Come on. Come on, dance with me. Come on, dance with me. When I say dance, you dance. Okay? Okay? Nobody says no to Raghuvansh. -Nobody says no to Raghuvansh. -No. No. Let go of me. Please. I am begging you. -Shut up and dance! -Sir, please let me go. -Help me! -Let's dance. Dance with me. Hey! Hey! Please. I am begging you. Let go of me. No. Help me! Help me! -Have you come home, daughter? -Yes mother. What is the matter? You are very late today. I have brought the money, mother. I have brought the money. This is very good. Now everything will be all right. Yes mother. Now everything will be all right. Everything. The meaning is very clear. Naresh's uncle lives in America. And after their marriage, I am thinking about getting both of them settled there. What do you say, child? But it is very important to arrange money to pay the expenses of going to America. Isn't it, brother? Look brother, I don't have much but... We can arrange for twenty of twenty-five thousand rupees. We will. You are being naive, sister. You don't even get the tickets to go to America in twenty or twenty-five thousand rupees. I think the entire expense will be of rupees two lakhs. Right, child? You bring the procession. You will get the money before the nuptial rounds. You will get the money? By doing the road shows. By doing cabaret. I am tired of my middle class life. Even I want money. I want a good house. I want good clothes. So you will make a joke out of yourself for that. You will expose your body. If I had become your wife then what would I get by doing the household chores? The same amount of two or four thousand rupees. If I dance in the club then I will get it every night. Ten thousand. Twenty-five thousand. I spit on the woman... who sees no difference between a husband and a wife and the business of exposing yourself for money. Shankar. Shashi, why did Shankar leave? What did you tell him? For my needs, Shankar would have sold his sincerity and his honesty, mother. And I would have never been able to bear it. And anyway, your daughter who has been ruined due to her circumstances, I don't have anything to give to him. Nothing. -Hello. -Hello. It's me, child. -Yes mother. -The preparations for Tina's wedding are complete. Really? Really, mother. This is good news. But my child, the money... Don't worry about the money. I am right here. All the arrangements will be done. You just make the arrangements for the wedding. Everything will be all right. Everything. And then the people who play with cruelty like a game... will be brought to death's door by your daughter. I found it! I have found the miraculous priest's hermitage. Priest. Priest. Priest. -Who is it? -Have mercy on me, Lord. Have mercy on this poor man. Where should I go, Lord? Where should I go? Why are you pleading, child? I don't want to plead but I want to meet, priest. Take the curse back, priest. We are husband and wife. What awkward position have you put us into? She is an animal. I am a human being. How do we meet halfway, priest? The curse that I have given, it can never be taken back, child. Why can't it be taken back, priest? Is it a sold good that it cannot be taken back? Goods once sold will not be returned. No priest. You are the creator. You are the only superstar priest in this world. Lord, please do something. Please do something, Lord. Priest! Please do something. Otherwise I will die without being dead, my lord. The curse that I had given, I cannot take it back. But, I can reduce its effect. She will have to meditate Lord Brahma's prayers for 40 Mondays. If I am impressed then I will release her. -Alakh Niranjan. -Alakh Niranjan. -Pushpa! Pushpa! -Santu! -40 Mondays. -Yes. 40 Mondays. Pushpa... -we have played many one-day matches. -Yes. Now we will play the Monday matches too. Monday ticket. Monday ticket. Monday... Tonight, Khanna will attend the function. And we will kidnap him from the function. I am not highly educated but I know at least this much, that you are a fool. Hey! What do you mean? Have patience! After the function, and before boarding the flight... Khanna will definitely come to meet Sheela darling. Alone. Good. Very good. But I have one condition. That none of you will kill the chairman. You will have to bring him to me. Alive. I will kill him. This... Forget humans, even the Gods will be unable to understand this trick. -Will you kill the chairman? -Yes. But you have roamed around here and there with him. That is not the matter, Raghu darling. Becoming intimate with the chairman was a part of my plan. It was my helplessness. And I have done all that for your sake. Don't you know that I hate that chairman so much? What? Hey! What are you saying, darling? Yes. That chairman is a bastard. He tried to... He tried to... What did he try to do with you? No. Forget it. You will tense up. Hey! I am asking you what he did to you. Tell me. He tried to... He tried to molest me. He tried to rape me. Look at this. Hey! Hey! Hey! How dare that bastard! I will... It was a good thing that the waiter came in. Otherwise... I will kill him. No. No. No. My darling, no. Just listen to me. To fire a bullet and to use a weapon is a man's job. I am not highly educated but I definitely know... how to put this bullet into that chairman's chest? Darling, you are not a man. You are a lion. A lion. -You are a lion. Naughty boy. -My darling!

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Congratulations! Well done, my boy! Thank you, sir. I apologize. In spite of trying very hard, I couldn't win this prize. You are not to blame my child. It is destiny that is against me. I had thought that, with this money... that son of mine would get a new life the one fighting against death in the hospital. But now I have one wish. That I die, before my son does. Nothing was lacking in your efforts. Nothing was lacking. Uncle, wait a minute. I never thought that you would be such a great person. Not just this competition, I cannot win any competition against you in life. Take this, Neeru. You give this check to him. Take this, uncle. Get your child operated. Thank you. Thank you, son. But uncle, we will have to change the name on this check. -Come on, let us go to Mr. Khanna. -Come on. Excuse me. Excuse me. Side please. Excuse me. Okay, my friend. I will come back from London. Then we shall meet. I am not highly educated, but I know this much... that there is nothing more important than a friend. Take care of yourself, my friend. I shall meet you very soon. Fine. Mr. Khanna. Wait, Mr. Khanna. Come on, we shall follow him. Give the keys of the bike. -Okay. Come on. -I will drop this at your house. Where did he go, Neeru? Don't move. It is strange. We were right behind him. -And now... -Jai! Look over there. They are taking the chairman. Oh my God! Loot. Police. Neeru, there must be a phone nearby. You go call the police. -I will go inside. -But Jai... This is not the time to argue. Neeru, go. What are you doing? No! Come on. Let's go. Open the locker. -This is the public's money! -This is ours. The law... The law will not spare you. Open the locker, chairman otherwise I will kill you. Come on. I will open it. I will open it. "The veil has been stained" Brother, is there a phone around? -There is no phone here. -Oh no! Come on. Hurry up. Hello. Nehru Nagar police station. Inspector Shankar. I am his brother Jai speaking. -Come on. Come on. -Who is he? He is inspector Shankar's brother... The one who has made our survival difficult. -Today I will kill this bastard. -Stop! We have another way of getting revenge on his brother. We will be the ones looting... But the camera will click pictures of him. Hey, Blacky! What do you think? You say the word and I will do it? Hey fool! Not just you, even your saviors will do it. Fill up the boxes... or we will kill the chairman. No. No. Save me. Save me. Son, save me. Come on. Listen to me, is there a telephone over here? -What? -The bank is being looted. Brother. Brother. Hello. Hello police station. Hey! No station. You are amazing! You are so pretty! Help! -Come on, Neeru. Let's go. -What happened, Jai? Come on. Come on. Ragunath, this is your prey. Where is your partner? Call her and kill him. Women don't do such things. Men do it. Men do it. Oh! So you have done all this. You are the worst friend. You are not a friend but a betrayer. Really? And you are a very good friend, aren't you? You bastard! You tried to molest my Sheela? You tried to rape her? I am going to... You became Sheela's lover? Take this. This is Sheela's revolver. And the bullets are also hers. Embrace her. Jai! Chairman! Come on. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome, my brave men! Lata, until all this wealth is not allocated properly it will remain in this container in my cold storage. Yes! That is correct. Yes. But, listen to me. For the sake of the security of this safe along with your men, and these dead animals even my men will be present here. And you will have one key of this safe while I have the other. When both the keys are put into it... only then will this safe open. Why? Do you agree? I agree. Hey dear! Hey brother! Just show me once... what five to seven crores look like? Come on, I shall show you. Yeah! Sir, Mr. Khanna did not boarded the flight. This means that Mr. Khanna has been trapped by those criminals. Sir, the projector is ready. Sir, let's see the pictures taken by the secret camera. Yes, come on. This is not possible. Do you know him, Shankar? He... he is my younger brother. From the film it seems as though your brother was involved in the robbery. It's impossible, sir. I understand your sentiments, but what is the truth? You have to inquire whether your brother was involved in this robbery or not. And I know, Mr. Shankar, you will fulfill your responsibility with complete honesty. Mr. Gokhale... issue an arrest warrant in the name of Jai Verma. And arrest him wherever you see him. Yes sir. Here. Drink water. -I'll get some more. -Let it be. We should leave this place. We should tell the police everything so that they can inquire the death of the chairman and arrest those robbers. That's true. Come. Let's go. But can you walk? I am sorry! I am sorry! Are you hurt? What is this sorry? Can't you say that you're hurt? You broke my head. Why are you yelling at me? First you got me wrapped up in a robbery, then you broke my leg, and now you've brought me here, in the middle of a jungle in this palace of ghosts. God knows what sort of dangerous animals live in this jungle. What else could I do? Stop following the thieves? Ok, now stop crying. We are far away from the city... in the middle of this dark jungle. It was pointless to walk in this state. And by the way, there are no dangerous animals in this jungle. They are here. Look at your dangerous animals. How stupid. Very stupid. -Do you smoke? -What? No, I don't. Do you smoke? No, you idiot. If you were a smoker you would have a matchbox, and if you had a matchbox, we could have lit a fire. And the cold would disappear. That's true. Come. Get up. Look, cold kills cold. You have a bath with that cold water, I'll light a fire. How? Watching you bathe... will make me so hot... By rubbing two stones together. I learnt it when I was in scouts. Stone, stone, stone. "My sweetheart is in front of me" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "I want to watch her To my heart's content" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "I want to watch him To my heart's content" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "Why did you hide in the clouds" "Right when my darling Was in front of me?" "Why did you hide in the clouds" "Right when my darling Was in front of me?" "Why did he hide in the clouds" "Right when your darling Was in front of you?" "If it's so necessary to hide, then come" I'll hide you in my veil" "In my veil" "In my veil" "Even when you hide in my veil" "Even when you hide in my veil" "Oh moon, keep shining" "I want to watch her To my heart's content" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "Then he took me in His arms in front of you" "Then he took me in His arms in front of you" "Then he took me in His arms in front of you" "Then he took me in His arms in front of you" "I found the company of my love" "On the lonely roads of life" "On these lonely roads" "On these lonely roads" "Now the journey of Life has become easier" "Now the journey of Life has become easier" "Oh moon, keep shining" "I want to watch him To my heart's content" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" "My sweetheart is in front of me" "Oh moon, keep shining" Let your law think whatever it wants. But I know that my son is innocent. Even if your heart is not the best witness, then my heart too... does not consider Jai a criminal. But he has made things difficult by running from the law. He is childish, he has yet to see this world. Rescue him from this problem. Promise me, that you won't let anything happen to him... That you'll bring him back home. Tell me, dear. Tell me. Why are you quiet? Tell me! You have to swear on my love for you. Mom, if your blessings are with me... then Shankar will never fail to do his duty. He will never fail. Commissioner, if we don't get the party's money then the high command will fire me -and I'll hang you upside down. -Yes sir. Wow! This seems like a very romantic place to me. This waterfall, my thirsty young body. Come, my... You're scared for no reason. It was just a pigeon. "These pigeons fell On my face from the top" She is giving me shocks. -Madam... Look... Look... -Look at what? It has been so long since you have shown me anything. My body is burning. Fire, water, smoke, where? "My heart started beating" "My body started burning" "Darling, leave my wrist" "Don't pluck the flowers which have not yet bloomed" Madam! Madam! Madam! You forgot the curse given by Alakh Niranjan. You forgot the curse! You forgot the curse! The curse! You became a bitch again? You became a bitch. Are you happy now? "My heart started beating" Now keep on barking. How many times have I told you, madam that do your duty, do your duty? Why are you barking? Tell me at least? Madam! Madam! Listen to me, madam! Jai's handkerchief! So that means we are heading in the right direction. Madam, keep your nose to the ground... smell them, and take me to them. Please madam. Shall we go? We should? One moment madam, I am coming too. Wait, go slow, go slow. Madam! I can't find the spot where criminals threw the body of the chairman after killing him. The whole jungle seems to be one and the same. There must be dangerous animals here. What if an animal ate him? Come on! Where are you taking me? You have become a bitch, but I am a man. How much longer can I run? If you run like that, then I won't even be able to walk. Bitch, we have to increase our love slowly, we have to cross the limits. Bitch, where else do we have to go? There must be snakes and scorpions there. Brother, please save me! Brother, please save me! Brother, please save me from this bitch. Neeru, she is not a bitch, she is your sister-in-law. -What? -She is Pushpa. -What? -What? This is so strange! Does this mean that the curse will never disappear? It will, if I feed 40 priests. I have to serve them and make them meet the head of the priests. Then she'll become a human being. -Yes. -Well, let it be. The police think that you are the criminal, Jai. But you know the truth, brother. But who'll believe the truth? My brother, my brother will believe me. He won't believe you. He is a police officer. He only believes evidence. Then we'll search for the evidence. The criminals were hidden here somewhere. And they had even murdered chairman Khanna. -They murdered him? -Yes. But we didn't find any criminal, neither any dead body. Pushpi, did we see any dead body? I think there is something here. Come with me. Run slowly, slowly. She really tires me out, I swear. Pushpi! Where are you going? Is there a dead body? Is there a letter in your mouth? Don't eat it. Don't eat it. Throw it. Throw it. Matchbox. Be careful, it might be a bomb. You'll burst into pieces. Star club. Five weeks have passed since her husband disappeared and we can't even find his dead body. And five days have passed since the chairman disappeared and we can't even find his dead body. Five crores are missing from the bank and the dead body is not yet found. And this phone has been ringing for the past five minutes. Should I kill you both? Hello, Nehru Nagar police station. -Is this Shankar sir? -Yes. There is important information for you. Some international smugglers are going to gather tonight at Star club. And you will have to witness the occasion for yourself. Who is speaking? Come and recognize me. "My darling has come" "Love has come" "My darling has come" "The cheater has come" "The message for which I was waiting" "That message has arrived" "The message for which I was waiting" "That message has arrived" "Your name has entered" "Into my heartbeats" "The message for which I was waiting" "That message has arrived" "Don't mind" "If I love you" "Don't mind" "Don't mind" "If I love you" "Don't mind" "If I love you" "That time has come" "When the heart does not Remain in control" "Your name has entered" "My heartbeats" "The message for which I was waiting" "That message has arrived" "My destiny was against me" "To bring you to me on its own" "You would come To me on your own" "My destiny was against me" "To bring you to me on its own" "My destiny was against me" "To bring you to me on its own" "The secret which was hidden" "In my heart, has been revealed" "Your name has entered" "My heartbeats" "The message for which I was waiting" "That message has arrived" "Your name has entered" "My heart beats" He has murdered him! He is dead! Someone please catch him! Don't let this bastard go! Catch him! Brother, I am innocent. I haven't done this murder. Shut up! You are under arrest. No one will leave until everyone's statement is taken. Mr. Singh, call up the police station. Inspector, this man was my brother. Your brother has murdered my brother. I am going to kill him. Don't try to take on the law. Only the court can punish him. What? Even you think that I am a criminal? I'll save you if you're innocent. I am not very educated, but I know that we are all witnesses to this murder. We'll see to it that you won't be able to save your brother. Don't move! You will save me, brother? Everybody has already branded me as a criminal. I can't take the blame of someone else's murder on myself. Stop, Jai, otherwise I'll shoot you. Then you'll kill two innocent people. Not me, but someone else is the murderer. Jai! Jai stop! Stop, Jai! Jai! Stop, Jai! Stop! Shame on us! Shame on us! That young boy shot our Biswas in front of everyone. And us idiots were just staring at each other's faces. My question is, why didn't you kill that guy in the bank itself? Why are we arguing over what didn't happen? We should think about what we have to do next. I was thinking the same thing. What did that guy get by killing Biswas? I was there, even commander was there. What do you say minister? Don't tell me, you thought four people, four shares. What are you trying to say? I am not so educated, but I know that if my share has increased, even your share has increased. Even you might be the murderer. -Minister! Mind your tongue! -You have started arguing again. There were so many people there I was there, and even that dancer girl. Shashi! General, is it possible that Shashi is trying to take revenge? Revenge! Revenge for what? Nothing... Commander, the buyers have run away. Even the police doubt us. Ok, I'll arrange my ship, and we'll send the things abroad. And, give the order to our men to shoot that guy on sight. Kill the bastard! Who is it at this time? Shankar? Police? Right now, I am on duty, and I've come here as a police inspector. -Search the house. -Search the house? But why? A man called Biswas has been murdered in the club. His body was in Jai's hands. I tried to stop him, but he still escaped. What does this prove, mom? You tell me. You mean... Jai is a murderer? No, no, my Jai cannot be a murderer! Come on. There is no one here, sir. Ok, send a message to not let Jai escape. Yes sir. I know that you feel very bad. But do you know... what your son put me through today? I had to shoot Jai as part of my duty. By the grace of God, I missed. But what if he had been shot? How would I explain it to you? How would I explain it to myself? I can't understand why Jai didn't surrender himself to me? Has he forgotten that we are brothers? That your blood runs in our body! Brother! Jai, you're here? Brother, brother! Brother, please forgive me. -Mom, mom, please believe-- -I believe you, son. Just once, put your hand on my head and say that you're innocent. I swear on you mom, I am absolutely innocent. And from now on, from now on I'll do what brother says. Here brother. Arrest me. Don't worry Jai... this brother of yours will sacrifice his own life for yours. Brother! After going through the testimonies and the evidence presented the court has come to the decision that criminal jai Verma is guilty. This court sentences him to life imprisonment. Is this your justice, brother? No, this is absolutely wrong, judge. This is injustice towards honesty. And I won't let this happen. Officer! Arrest him! Shankar! Don't break the rules of the court and law. -Hold him. -Don't you dare, commissioner! Jai, come with me. They have to cross my dead body before touching you. -Shankar! -Brother! Shankar! -Brother! -Shankar! No, brother, you'll even sacrifice your own life to save mine. And I don't want you to dishonor your duty. Excuse me, sir, I have some important work with you. Ok, you come to my office tomorrow and meet me. One moment sir, it's very urgent, one minute. Excuse me. Yes, tell me, what is it? Sir, you said you would give me that money? Yes, but the amount is quite big. But, because it's for your sister's wedding I won't refuse. How about this... Come over tonight... and your work will be done. Happy? Thanks. Give me a chance too, to say thanks like that. See you. Let me get the money once, I'll give you such a chance that you won't be able to ask for a chance again. Neeru, you wait here... I'll go see that commander Mustaque. I am afraid, Jai. If anything happens to you... Don't worry. Shashi? She's here early. Hi! What are you doing here? Wherever I go, I always drop by unannounced. Why? Actually, I was just going to come out after having a bath. It's very important for me to go out for a party. Sometimes, it's profitable to cancel important programs for not so important meetings. Profit! What kind of a profit? You go and have a bath. I'll explain everything when you come out. I'll tell you everything. Naughty boy! I'll make a drink. Go. I'll be right back. Darling, want a drink? I have been wishing for so long to spend an evening with you. Here, have a drink. Darling! Drink it from my hands. Enough. Stop here. Here's your money. Hello. Mustaque has been murdered. Get to his house. Both, the dead body and the murderer are present there. Mustaque sir! Sir! Mustaque sir! Sir! Mustaque Sir! Sir! Oh, he's having a bath. Sir! Sir, shall I take the money and go? I am in a hurry, sir. What happened? Shashi what happened? That dead body! Oh my God! A murder! Jai... you have murdered him! What? You... you are a murderer! But why? What are you saying, Shashi? I am very sure that these people had robbed the bank and put the blame on me. I came here to collect evidence, which will help me prove myself innocent. But what are you doing here? I came here to take the money for my sister's wedding. No one will believe us. Now what do we do? Now what do we do? You do one thing, take this money and leave before anyone gets here. And what about you, Jai? I'll destroy the evidence that says we were here. No Jai, I can't leave you here. Please Shashi, this is not the time to argue. Please, go. Sweety, here! -Brother, you? -Now don't tell me that you have not committed this murder. I haven't done it brother, please, I... Nobody can save you now. Everything is equal before the law, brother. I am asking you for the last time. What's the truth? Nothing else is the truth besides this, brother. The conditions and helplessness have -have made me look like a criminal. -No! You won't confess that easily. You won't confess that easily. I have to cross all limits. Ok? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me what the truth is! Say it! Say it! Confess! Say it! I know, brother. These blows hurt you more than me. But believe me. I haven't done any murder, I haven't done any robbery. Then what was that? I have seen you move that dead body at the scene of the crime. Please, my brother, tell me the truth, please! I have already told you the truth, brother. Now I am ready, even if I am to be hanged. But I won't let this happen. Who are you? She's my sister, sir. Please listen to her statement, sir. Shankar, I don't know why Jai is doing all this to save that dancer, Sweety? I've seen her coming out of Mustaque's flat. -Neeru, please. -What? I don't understand... why do you want to hang yourself for her? How is she related to you? No matter how much I hit you... My soul refused to believe that you were a criminal. Then why did you do this? Tell me, why did you do this? For Shashi? No, brother, no. Shashi does not deserve your sympathy. Please forgive me. Where did you get this much money from? This is my money. Mustaque has given it to me as an advance. Advance! I had given the briefcase full of money to Mustaque. Mustaque has been murdered, and the briefcase is with you. The evidence is enough to hang you in my court. It's true that I went to Mustaque's house... and that I took that briefcase from his house. But at that time he was already dead. And there was only his dead body over there. A dead body is what you will now be. A living dead body. I'll make you sit in the club. Customers will come in plenty, understand? I had already become a dead body the day you three bastards raped me. The three of you, killed my dreams and my happiness. I still breath, just so that I can fulfill my responsibilities towards my family. After killing my partners... you want to get your sister married, you bitch! Biswas and Mustaque were lucky, that they died easily... but today you'll have to suffer. I'll kill you bitch! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! No Shashi, he does not deserve to be killed like that! No Shankar, please let me kill him! You don't know how much this jerk has made me suffer. This swine will suffer for his sins. He'll definitely suffer! He'll definitely suffer! Don't cry, Shashi, don't cry. You were mine no matter what... you are mine, and you'll always be mine. Move, move, move! You have made my life worse than hell. When people celebrate their wedding anniversary... at that time, their wives apply lipstick, they wear flowers in their hair, they wear a sari... and hug their husbands with a smile. But you, bringing your tar like face next to mine, removing your tongue out, throwing spit out, you just roam about licking everything, every time. Until this curse is not lifted. I will not live with you in your house. I won't live with you, I won't eat with you, I won't sleep with you. I'll live here! "Under the blue sky, where the love for earth is born." Not where the love for the earth is born... but where this dog's love is born. These dogs are cuter than wives. They are more honest. Now take my wife for example, she loves later... but first, she hits me with her shoe. She hits me with her slipper. She puts false allegations on us. She says that I am having an affair with our neighbor, Champa. There is no Champa in our neighborhood. At least tell me who this Champa is? This dog is more honest and cute than such a wife. Come, my darling! Hey! Just move from there, move, move behind. "Whenever I see a Tommy my heart says" "Ohle-ohle, ohle, ohle-ohle, ohle." Hey Pushpi, forget about this drunkard but don't you have any shame? Hey brother, this is not your Tommy, this is my wife... "Have you seen such a foolish who's calling Tommy his wife" "Ohle-ohle, ohle, ohle-ohle, ohle." How many times should I tell you that she is my wife? -You donkey! That is a dog. -She is my wife. -It is a dog. -She is my wife. He is a dog. Look at his tail. Shall I show you my tail? -Do you have a tail? -Yes, I have. I caught you. Today, I caught you openly with Champa. -No, no, no, no... -You shameless. -Did he misbehave with your wife? -He hugged her. If I had not caught him, God knows what he would have done. -You shameless. -No, no, no, no, no... but she is not Champa, it's a dog. -Is it a dog? -Yes, see. Pushpi, wedding anniversary! Such a big bomb fell on me, do you know? Pushpi! Pushpi! You jerk! You're calling a young lady a dog? I know that this is your Champa. You swine, couldn't you find anyone else's husband? -Stop hitting on my husband! -Quiet, quiet, quiet. This is not Champa. She is my wife... Pushpa, sub-inspector, Pushpa. And your husband loves only you, understand? -What? -Yes darling, yes. This Tommy is telling the truth. -She's my wife. -Yes darling, if you stop doubting me then I'll quit drinking. -Really? -Yes. So sweet! This is unexpected. She has started kissing me. Kiss me again. "Don't do all this acting here, go to your house, and" "Sleep-sleep, sleep, sleep-sleep, sleep." -Bye Tommy. -Shut up! Sleep-sleep! Happy anniversary darling! -Congratulations! -What happened? You'll turn into that dog again! Santu... It's a good thing that the inspector's brother was caught. I was afraid that I'd be the next victim. Here my darling, take this. Inspector! Come inspector, come. I am not that educated, but I know this much... that you've come here to bail your brother out, right? But brother, in this case even a minister can't do anything. Don't say that, sir. -Madam, may I get a glass of water? -Sure. Sir, you can do anything you want. Yes, I can do anything I want, but I won't. Your rascal brother was caught with the dead body in the club. Not once, but twice. And both of them were my best friends. I'll go to the court and give a statement, that rascal should be hanged. No Raghu darling, don't yell. It's every citizen's duty to help the police. Here you go. Do you recognize this earring? Did you tense up on seeing this? I am not tensed, but I am shocked to hear such a silly question. Obviously, this earring must belong to some woman. Even I know that. But which woman wears this earring... is an important question. Because the police found this earring near Mustaque's dead body. What are you trying to say, that this earring belongs to my darling? You consider me the murderer? Look inspector, no need to jump so much. Otherwise, I will strip you of your uniform and send you home. Mind your tongue, Raghunath Singh. You were present when the minister was depositing the party's money into the bank. Sheela and you have been a bit too friendly with both General Mustaque and Biswas. It's enough to have you both listed as suspects. Only time will tell whether Sheela committed the murder or not. Because the murderer's fingerprints are on this earring. Anyway, do you both mind if I take this glass along with me? You want to take the glass and implicate us? Don't you know what my identity is? I know your identity very well. I just need to expose it to everyone. Which jerk has called up now? -Hello. -Raghunath. The police is raiding all of our hideouts. We should take the stuff and immediately leave the country. Get the key and meet me at the cold storage, quickly. Don't worry. I am on my way. It's such a dangerous place. Have you hidden the key here? That's not an ordinary key... it's our passport to heaven, passport and visa, visa. And this is your ticket. Death, from your own gun. You bitch, Raghunath is the kind of dog who, if he does not get a bone, he bites his own master. This is your injection. Bitch! You could kill me... I had never even thought of this. You, my friend, would be a cheater. You have drowned me. You left your earring in Mustaque's bed and you hesitate to sleep with me. Bitch! You never understood me, Raghu. I was crazy about you. Once, just one last time, please hug me. -Are you telling the truth? -Yes. -You... you really loved me? -Yes. What happened, my queen? What happened? Chairman... you? Khanna! Forget about the people near him... even the one who gave birth to Khanna couldn't understand him. You couldn't recognize me, could you? I... I understand, you gave me this... this revolver filled with fake bullets. But... But... why did you do all this? Why? -For what? -For what? I'll tell you, I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you the whole game. I took a huge amount of money from the bank. The inquiry started taking place. When the minister decided to collect the money... a plan formed in my mind. I met you as Sheela, made the plan of robbing the bank so that the blame of the money which I had robbed comes on those robbers. And it worked! And then, I killed everyone one by one. Only the general remains now. He won't escape. All this wealth will be mine. The chairman will be back on his chair, and Sheela will disappear. You'll keep on searching for me, you'll keep on searching for me. What? You want a kiss? You want a kiss? You'll want my kiss! Raghunath Singh! No, don't kill me, Sheela! Don't kill me, Sheela! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! No! No! Don't kill me! Chairman Khanna! Chairman Khanna! Yes, I am chairman Khanna. Inspector Shankar, please take me to the hospital. Take me to the... I kept pleading. I knew neither day, nor night. They used to hold me in darkness, in my own urine. I used to live in my own dirt. Can you tell us their names and how they looked? Yes, never, I can never forget that name. Biswas, Mustaque, there was a boy... who won the dance competition, Jai, Jai Verma. The chairman is alive? But the criminals had killed Khanna. -What? -Yes, brother, this is the truth. We have seen it with our own eyes. Yes, brother, think about it. Why would such dangerous people leave Khanna alive? -Yes sir? -It's a phone call for you. For me? Here? Look, I don't like it when your personal phone-calls come here. Stop this, otherwise I'll complain. -Sorry sir. I don't know how... -It's all right. Take it. Hello! Hello! Yes, good. -Hello! -Sir, sir we found Sheela's file. Sir, we found the file. We even found the chairman's driver, Bhim Singh. Good, sir. Dead! The body was buried in Sheela's house. But sir, two years have passed since Sheela died. According to the file, she died two years back. It's so strange. Sheela died. She came back to life. The chairman died. He came back to life. -Hello. -Hello inspector. This is Sheela speaking. The chairman is with me. Here, talk to him. Inspector... inspector, please save me! This... this Sheela will kill me! Please save me! Give me the phone! Look inspector, put 10 lakh rupees in a bag... and come to Nehru park gate exactly at 11:00. I'll cut him into pieces if you try to follow me. Come on, Jai! What? Is your brother the commissioner? Go in, go, go. Everything is all right. -Good evening, doctor. -Good evening. Why are you crying? So what if your wife gave birth to a girl? -Children are God's... -What is this daughter-daughter? My father has expired. -Where is the chairman? -Inside, in his room. General! Why are you so late? It's terrible! Raghunath has been murdered! -He has been murdered! -Yes... -Where's the key? -Don't worry, the key is here, near my heart. I don't understand how that chairman came back to life? -What! Don't you know anything? -What do you mean? That Raghunath and chairman were behind this plan. Raghunath had just pretended to kill the chairman in front of you. And that chairman had killed Biswas and Mustaque one by one. Today, they were both going to kill you and me... but thank God the police got there on time. I faced a lot of difficulties on my way here. You bitch! Do you think I am a fool? God knows everything, both the secret and the result. I've come to know your truth. What kind of truth? Clicking an intimate photograph with the chairman... kidnapping the chairman in the dark from his house... the death of Raghunath, the chairman appearing again... all this is planned by you and that bastard, chairman. Mine and chairman's? Yes, yours and chairman's. You and that chairman murdered Biswas, Mustaque and Raghunath. Today I won't spare you. I'll kill you, you bitch. Please spare me! Please let me go! I beg of you! Khanna was blackmailing me. He had some naked photographs of mine. Please take me along with you! Please take me along with you! I'll accept whatever you give me. I'll even accept 40 percent. 40 percent! Today, I'll cut you into 40 pieces! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! You bitch! Are you distributing your shares? So finally you have arrived, Shankar. Good! And me too, the most important criminal in this robbery. Sheela, where is the chairman? I won't tell you. The chairman is with me. Good! Wrong, the chairman is with Jai. No brother, you're forgetting, the chairman is with you. Sheela, what nonsense is this? This is not nonsense, it's a very interesting story... which starts from the death of the driver of the chairman of the bank and ends at the murder of a nurse. That nurse, whose hair was cut by the murderer after her murder. Can you tell me why the murderer did that, Sheela? Because up until now, that murderer... had been blaming someone else. But now he wanted to cover his bald head, right Sheela? No, it's not right, This is not Sheela... but chairman Khanna. Get lost. Excellent! Chairman! Only strength or brains do not win a war. You need both strength and brains to win a war... which Raghuvansh Singh has. Shankar, I knew that you would smell the ground and come here like a dog. That's why I brought these girls. Take these bastards away, put them in the mincing machine! Take them away! Put these beautiful ladies on my ship. They are things to be taken abroad... they'll be with me day and night. Go! Go! Get lost! Sir, I am very afraid of death... We are both husband and wife. Please tie us together. Please tie us together! Sir, if we can't eat or drink without each other then why should we die without each other? I beg of you, sir, God will make you a Super General instead of a General. Please tie us together. Tie them together! Finish off this bastard! Go. -"Listen." -"Say." -"I said." -"I heard." "Did something happen?" "Nothing, not yet." -"The breeze..." -"Is moving." -"The cloud..." -"Has stopped." "Did anything happen?" "Something has happened." What's happening? Sir, even the devil fulfills the last wish of one who is dying. You are the Super Devil. Please give two minutes to us husband-wife to bid goodbye. Ok, shoot these two after two minutes. Where are you going? Where are you going? Your boss told you leave us alone, didn't he? Look there. "Something has happened." "Something has happened." Why didn't you shoot them yet? Give me the gun. You swine! You'll hit a police officer? You want to fight me? Pushpi! Pushpi! Pushpi! Pushpi! Pushpi! Now you're dead! Load this bastard along with the stuff and the car. Bring him! I'll see him later. Shankar! Shankar! This wealth is mine, you bastards! I won't spare anyone. I kidnapped you? I robbed the bank? I murdered Biswas? I murdered Mustaque? No! No! No! Please forgive me! I didn't... do anything! I didn't do anything! You bastard! Sheela has done everything, right? Sheela has done everything. Commissioner sir, commissioner please save me! -Please save me! -What happened? This police officer wants to save his brother. He wants to take away all the wealth. This is not the truth, commissioner. He has made the plan. He is Sheela. Sheela? And I? Please trust me, sir. Trust. Everyone would believe you, chairman... but you made a mistake. You destroyed each and every evidence of Sheela's but you forgot to rub off this lipstick. If you are not Sheela, then why are you wiping your lips? There isn't any lipstick on your lips. -Arrest him! -I won't spare you! I'll kill you! I won't spare any of you! I told you, don't do wrong. Now you have been implicated, haven't you? You were a fool, and you'll always be. Why were you wiping your lipstick? Now I'll leave you and go away. You implicated me. No darling! No darling! Please don't leave me and go, darling! I'll be back to take the money! I'll be back to take the money! Don't leave me and go! I'll be back! I'll be back! Sir! Sir! Sir! Please accept our leave applications now. So that I can go to priest Alakh Niranjan... touch his feet and tell him that... Priest! At least now, give us freedom, priest! Alakh Niranjan. Santu! Pushpa! Priest, thank you so much, priest! -Priest! -Pushpi!
