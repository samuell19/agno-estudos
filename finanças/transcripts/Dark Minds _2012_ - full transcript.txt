Reporter: MAY 20, 2005 CHANGED JENNINGS FOREVER. ON THAT DAY, THE FIRST OF EIGHT JENNINGS FEMALES TURNED UP DEAD. Woman: I'M ASKING ANYONE OUT THERE. IF YOU HAVE SEEN BRITTNEY, PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE, CALL ME. Reporter #2: LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SAY THE KILLER IS FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA. Man: THESE LADIES DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE. THEY WERE DUMPED JUST OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, NUDE. WHEN THEY FLIPPED HER OVER, HER FACE WASN'T THERE NO MORE. WHEN THEY FOUND MY SISTER, MY SISTER WAS LAYING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. Narrator: EIGHT WOMEN FOUND DEAD IN AND AROUND JENNINGS, LOUISIANA, DEEP IN THE HEART OF CAJUN COUNTRY. Lewis: THE WAY THE BODIES ARE FOUND AND THE WAY THERE'S SO MANY SIMILARITIES, IT JUST HAS THOSE HALLMARKS OF SOMETHING THAT'S ORGANIZED AND VERY KIND OF METICULOUS. EVERYONE WITHIN THIS WHOLE PARISH IS LIVING IN FEAR. Narrator: WITH ALL THE CASES STILL UNSOLVED 10 YEARS LATER, DEEPLY HELD SUSPICIONS ARE TEARING THE COMMUNITY APART. Man #2: JEFFERSON DAVIS PARISH POLICE, IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE, A GIRL WOULDN'T HAVE DIED! EVERYTHING IS ABOUT MONEY, DRUGS, MURDER. Man #3: YOU'RE MESSING WITH SOME POWERFUL PEOPLE HERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE SCARED TO TALK TO Y'ALL. WHO YOU THINK IT IS? ALRIGHT. Cormier: YOU KNOW, I HEAR PEOPLE ALL THE TIME SAYING THIS PERSON DID IT OR THAT PERSON DID IT. I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO PROVE THAT. I WOULD, LIKE, CUT YOU LIKE THAT. Narrator: NOW IN THIS 4-HOUR SPECIAL EVENT, EXCLUSIVE AND INTIMATE ACCESS TO THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES TAKES YOU DEEP INSIDE THEIR SEARCH FOR ANSWERS. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED. I WANT TO KNOW WHO DID IT, AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU PUT HER RIGHT HERE? THE ETHANOL LEVEL WAS .421. BUT SHE DIDN'T DRINK. SHE JUST DIDN'T. SHE NEVER DID. THE EXPLOSIVE STORY OF A TOWN FULL OF SECRETS AND SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS. YOU WANTS TO KNOW THE TRUTH, DON'T GO BY WHAT NO STREETS SAY BECAUSE THE STREETS LIE. ALL THE STREETS LIE FOR THE POWER OF THAT DRUG. Narrator: WHO KILLED THE JENNINGS 8? Drake: OH, YEAH. IT'S SO HOT HERE. YOU KNOW HOW A DOG SWELLS IN THE HEAT IN THE ROAD? THAT'S HOW OUR BODY DO HERE. WE LOVE CRAWFISH, BUT THEN WE GET STEAMED LIKE THE CRAWFISH. [ LAUGHS ] YES, INDEED. Hoag: WE MAKE A JOKE DOWN HERE THAT THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT LOUISIANAS. THERE'S NORTH LOUISIANA, WHICH IS THE PROTESTANT BIBLE BELT, AND THEN THERE'S NEW ORLEANS THAT EVERYBODY THINKS IS LOUISIANA, AND THEN THERE'S GOD'S COUNTRY OVER HERE. Drake: THIS IS A SMALL COMMUNITY. EVERYBODY KNOW EVERYBODY. YOU COULD COME IN TOWN AND SAY, "HEY, I'M LOOKING FOR SO-AND-SO." "OH, THEY LIVE OVER THERE, SUCH-AND-SUCH STREET." Narrator: PART OF JEFFERSON DAVIS PARISH, JENNINGS SITS IN THE SOUTHERN CORNER OF LOUISIANA, 172 MILES FROM NEW ORLEANS, DEEP IN CAJUN COUNTRY. [ ZYDECO MUSIC PLAYS ] LIKE MANY SMALL TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA, CHURCH AND FOOTBALL REIGN SUPREME. [ MARCHING BAND PLAYING ] [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] AND A LOT DEPENDS ON WHAT SIDE OF TOWN YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE ON. Peck: THERE'S A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE ON EACH SIDE OF THE TRACKS. THE NORTH SIDE, YOU HAVE THE MIDDLE TO UPPER CLASS, AND THEN ON THE SOUTH SIDE, YOU HAVE THE WORKING CLASS AND SOME OF THE POOR. Lewis: KIND OF THE HAVES AND THE HAVE-NOTS IS A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT. Narrator: WHILE IT'S HAD ITS SHARE OF STRUGGLES... AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, HURRICANES, DRUGS... THINGS WERE ONCE PRETTY QUIET HERE. JENNINGS IS A TOWN WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A COUPLE OF MURDERS A YEAR ON A BUSY YEAR, IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF FIGHTS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE GET DRUNK ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, AND THEY HAVE A FIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAYBE THEY TEAR UP SOME PROPERTY, SOME DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I'M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUT NO DEPARTMENT THAT HAS LIVED UNDER THAT KIND OF CONDITION FOR DECADES IS GONNA SUDDENLY BE PREPARED FOR THIS VERY ORGANIZED, VERY SCARY SERIES OF CRIME. I'M A JOURNALIST WHO CAME HERE TO WRITE ABOUT ROTARY CLUB MEETINGS AND, YOU KNOW, THE OCCASIONAL GUY GETTING HIS HAND IN THE COOKIE JAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I HAD NO WAY TO BE PREPARED FOR THIS, AND I HAD NO WAY TO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW FAR-REACHING IT WOULD SPREAD INTO THE COMMUNITY. Narrator: BETWEEN 2005 AND 2009, THE BODIES OF EIGHT YOUNG WOMEN WERE DUMPED IN AND AROUND JENNINGS. MORE THAN 10 YEARS LATER, THE CASES ARE STILL NOT SOLVED, SO POLICE ARE RELEASING VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. TIRED OF WAITING FOR JUSTICE, TWO FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ON A MISSION TO FIND THE TRUTH ON THEIR OWN. Taylor: THERE'S THREE RIGHT THERE THAT NEED TO BE DRIED, BUT THESE AND THE REST OF THOSE SHIRTS ARE ALL WE HAVE, AND THERE ARE THOSE TWO ORDERS, TWO OR THREE ORDERS IN THE BACK. Jones: I WAS BORN IN JENNINGS, AND I'VE LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE. I LIKE THAT IT'S A SMALL TOWN AND THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY. I THINK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH JOB OPPORTUNITIES OUT HERE FOR ADULTS, AND MOST PEOPLE ARE LIVING CHECK TO CHECK. RAY'S WOULD BE RIGHT ACROSS THE TRACKS, WHICH WOULD BE THE SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN. YOU SEE A LOT MORE ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN. IT'S MORE... AS FAR AS PEOPLE ARE MORE OPEN AS TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THIS END. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, WE SEE A LOT OF DRUG DEALS IN THE PARKING LOT RIGHT HERE, AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SOLICITING IN THE WASHATERIA, SO, I MEAN, WE GET TO SEE OUR SHARE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. Narrator: WHILE SOUTH SIDE JENNINGS CAN SOMETIMES BE TOUGH, BRITTANY JONES AND TAYLOR DUBOIS HAVE MADE A GOOD LIFE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEY'VE DONE IT TOGETHER. AND YOU WANT TO WASH THOSE DARKS, OR ARE YOU LEAVING IN THOSE DARKS? NO, NOT... IT'S NOT A FULL BAG. Jones: TAYLOR AND I ARE PROBABLY CLOSER NOW THAN WE EVER WERE. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH OVER THE YEARS SINCE LOSING WHITNEI. THERE ARE MANY, MANY DAYS WHERE WE STAND AT THIS IRONING BOARD. THESE IRONING BOARDS HAVE HEARD MANY THINGS. WE SOLVE SO MANY PROBLEMS HERE, THOUGH. EXACTLY. IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO SOMETHING, THEN I HAVE IT, AND IF I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO SOMETHING, THEN SHE HAS IT, AND WE JUST FIGURE IT OUT. SHE TAKES THE SLACK OFF ME, AND I TAKE THE SLACK OFF OF HER, SO IT MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER. RIGHT, SISTER? THAT'S RIGHT. Narrator: BUT IT'S THE THIRD MEMBER OF THIS TIGHT-KNIT SISTERHOOD WHOSE ABSENCE IS KEENLY FELT. WHITNEI DUBOIS AND HER SISTER, TAYLOR, WERE ADOPTED AS CHILDREN BY BRITTANY'S GRANDPARENTS. WHITNEI AND I HAD ALWAYS SAID WE WERE SISTERS BECAUSE IN SCHOOL, WHEN... IT WAS EASIER TO... IT WAS HARD TO EXPLAIN TO CHILDREN THAT WHITNEI AND TAYLOR WERE MY AUNTS. WE WERE SO CLOSE IN AGE, AND IT WAS JUST... SO WE GREW UP TELLING PEOPLE WE WERE SISTERS, AND IT WAS JUST... IT WAS EASIER TO EXPLAIN THAT WAY, AND WE WERE RAISED THAT WAY. WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP, ME, TAYLOR, AND WHITNEI, WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER. WE WERE TEENAGERS. WE MADE MANY, MANY TRIPS TO WALMART SO THAT WE COULD BE SNEAKY AND MEET BOYS AND DO ALL THAT STUFF THAT TEENAGERS DO THAT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ANYWHERE, SO WE'D GO TO WALMART. Narrator: BUT IN MAY 2007, THAT SISTERHOOD WAS SHATTERED. Jones: IT WAS A SATURDAY. WE WERE HAVING A GRADUATION PARTY, AND THE FAMILY HAD PLANNED A HUGE CELEBRATION AT MY IN-LAWS'. EARLIER THAT MORNING, THERE WERE RUMORS THAT A BODY HAD BEEN FOUND, BUT NOBODY KNEW WHO IT WAS. Man #4: THERE WERE SEVERAL COP CARS, A FEW OTHER PEOPLE STANDING UP OVER THERE, AND AS I DROVE DOWN TO THE END, THEY SAID THERE WAS A CRIME SCENE. Reporter #3: WHAT INVESTIGATORS FOUND AT THE INTERSECTION OF BOBBY AND EARL DUHON ROAD IS THE BODY OF A WOMAN. A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION TELLS 7 NEWS THAT THE WOMAN'S BODY WAS NUDE. Man #4: I HEARD IT WAS A WOMAN. DON'T KNOW THE AGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, JUST THAT THE BODY WAS ON THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. Jones: THAT ENTIRE DAY, I KEPT ASKING EVERYBODY HAD THEY HEARD FROM WHITNEI, HAD ANYBODY SEEN WHITNEI. IT WAS ABOUT 3:00, 3:00 OR 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, AND MY GRANDMA CALLED. AS I'M ON THE PHONE WITH HER, SHE SAID, "WAIT, BRITTNEY. HOLD ON A SECOND." SHE SAID, "SOMEBODY IS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR." Narrator: BRITTNEY'S FATHER, MIKE, WAS LIVING WITH HER GRANDMOTHER AT THE TIME. Mike: A KNOCK CAME ON THE DOOR, AND THERE WERE A CORONER AND TWO DETECTIVES THAT CAME. MY MOTHER OPENED THE DOOR, INVITED THEM IN BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY HAD TO SPEAK WITH US. WHEN SHE GOT BACK ON THE PHONE, SHE SAID, "THE COPS ARE HERE, AND THEY SAID I HAVE TO HANG UP WITH YOU." AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT? WHY ARE THE COPS THERE?" AND SHE'S LIKE, "I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK," AND SHE HUNG UP. Mike: I REMEMBER MY MOM COMING INTO THE ROOM AND SAYING, "BABY, THERE'S TWO DETECTIVES AND THE CORONER HERE. THEY WANT TO TALK TO US. I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT WHITNEI," AND SHE WAS CRYING. SHE WAS CRYING. Jones: WHEN I GET THERE, I WALKED IN THE KITCHEN. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE BODY THAT HAD BEEN FOUND THAT MORNING WAS WHITNEI, AND, UH... ...I REMEMBER FALLING, AND, UM, I JUST... I HIT THE FLOOR. IT TOOK ME A SECOND TO REALIZE WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. AFTER THE DETECTIVES LEFT, AND WE ALL SAT AND CRIED. MY DAUGHTER, BRITTNEY, WENT AND BROKE THE NEWS TO BEYONCE, WHICH IS WHITNEI'S DAUGHTER. Jones: BEYONCE WAS 4, AND... SHE HAD A CARD IN HER HAND THAT SHE HAD MADE FOR HER MOM AT SCHOOL FOR MOTHER'S DAY. [ SNIFFLES ] AND I SAT HER ON MY LAP, AND I EXPLAINED TO HER ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE GO TO HEAVEN, AND I TOLD HER THAT HER MOM WAS IN HEAVEN. I'M PRETTY TOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO ALL THE REST OF IT. I'VE GRIEVED, AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL PROCESS OF IT ALL, BUT I CAN NEVER, EVER TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH BEYONCE WITHOUT CRYING. CHILDREN DON'T DESERVE TO GROW UP WITHOUT PARENTS. BEYONCE IS 16, SO NOW SHE'S OLDER WHERE SHE UNDERSTANDS THE SPECIFICS. MY ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND SOLVE IT BEFORE BEYONCE IS OLD ENOUGH TO GO LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS HERSELF. TAYLOR AND I COULD SAVE HER FROM THE HORROR STORIES AND THE NEGATIVITY. WHITNEI'S BODY WAS FOUND RIGHT HERE. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS ROAD WAS PAVED... IT WASN'T. ...LIKE, AT ALL. I HATE THE PAVEMENT. IT'S, LIKE, YOU'RE TRYING TO... COVER SOMETHING UP. ...COVER SOMETHING UP OR MAKE SOMETHING GO AWAY OR SOMETHING. LIKE, THE PAVEMENT JUST KILLS ME. I THINK IT'S UNIMAGINABLE THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW OR DON'T TALK BECAUSE THIS TOWN HAS NEVER OPERATED THAT WAY. PEOPLE ARE COVERING UP SOMETHING, AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY HUGE. Narrator: IN MAY 2007, WHITNEI DUBOIS' FAMILY IS DEVASTATED TO LEARN OF HER DEATH. EVEN THOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT GIVES THEM VERY LITTLE INFORMATION, THE LOCATION WHERE WHITNEI'S BODY IS FOUND IMMEDIATELY RAISES THEIR SUSPICIONS. STANDING OUT HERE, I'M THINKING TO MYSELF LIKE, "WHY RIGHT HERE? LIKE, WHAT LED TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA RIGHT HERE?" WHAT MADE THEM SAY, "OKAY, WE'RE GONNA DUMP HER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BUT NOT THE SIDE"? Taylor: SOMEBODY DID THAT ON PURPOSE, SO THAT WHOEVER CAME RIGHT HERE WAS LIKE, [ GASPS ] "A PERSON!" IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE WHAT I REMEMBER SEEING IN THE PICTURE WAS HER LAYING IN THE FETAL POSITION WITH HER BACK END FACING THIS WAY, ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE HAD JUST PUSHED HER OUT OF A VEHICLE, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S HOW SHE LANDED. AND SOMEONE HAD TO HAVE PUT HER HERE. SHE DIDN'T WALK HERE, SO WHY WOULDN'T THAT PERSON SAY SOMETHING? YOU'RE GONNA DIE WITH THIS ON YOUR CONSCIENCE? HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT? NONE OF IT ADDS UP. Narrator: TOXICOLOGY TESTS REVEAL A HIGH LEVEL OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL IN WHITNEI'S SYSTEM, BUT THE CORONER CAN'T DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF DEATH. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED. I WANT TO KNOW WHO DID IT, AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU PUT HER RIGHT HERE? BUT THE MOST SHOCKING FACT ABOUT WHITNEI'S DEATH IS THAT IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN'S NAKED BODY HAS BEEN DUMPED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN. THE STORY OF THE JENNINGS 8 STARTS 2 YEARS EARLIER. MAY 20, 2005 CHANGED JENNINGS FOREVER. A FISHERMAN SPOTS A BODY FLOATING IN THE GRAND MARAIS CANAL, ABOUT 5 MILES OUTSIDE JENNINGS. THE WOMAN IS LATER IDENTIFIED AS 28-YEAR-OLD LORETTA CHAISSON LEWIS. SHE'S BEEN MISSING FOR 3 DAYS. Reporter #1: LORETTA CHAISSON WAS THE FIRST OF EIGHT WOMEN TO DIE IN A TRAGIC SERIES OF SUSPICIOUS DEATHS IN JEFF DAVIS PARISH. NICK AND CHAD CHAISSON SAY THEY WERE CLOSEST IN AGE TO THEIR BIG SISTER, LORETTA. MOM CALLED ME. I WAS DRIVING AT THE TIME. SHE SAID, "LORETTA IS MISSING." AN OFFICER HAD COME BY. LORETTA HADN'T BEEN SEEN IN A FEW DAYS. "MOM," I SAID, "SHE ALWAYS TURNS UP." ALWAYS LEAVING. SHE SAID, "NO." SHE SAID, "THIS TIME," SHE SAID, "SHE ALWAYS CALLS. SHE ALWAYS CALLS ME." MOM WAS CRYING, AND IT WAS JUST A FEW HOURS LATER WHEN THEY FOUND HER. Narrator: THE MEMORY OF LORETTA'S DEATH IS JUST AS PAINFUL TODAY FOR HER TWO BROTHERS. TO GET THAT PHONE CALL, YOU'RE NEVER PREPARED FOR IT, AND YOU NEVER EXPECT IT, AND WE DIDN'T EXPECT IT. Chad: SHE KNEW EVERYBODY. MOST PEOPLE LIKED HER. THERE AIN'T A DAY THAT GOES BY I DON'T THINK ABOUT HER, YOU KNOW. IT'S JUST... NOT GROWING UP WITH HER IS, LIKE, WOW. YOU KNOW, I'M 40 YEARS OLD, AND I WANTED TO SEE MY SISTER BE THIS OLD, YOU KNOW. I DIDN'T GET TO SEE HER 30s. IT WAS JUST... SHE WAS 28. I KNOW. LORETTA WAS THE OLDEST, THEN IT WAS ME, AND THEN NICK WAS... SHE WAS A GOOD BIG SISTER, YOU KNOW. SHE WAS... FEISTY BUT SMARTASS. YEAH. COULDN'T DO... SHE WAS A FEISTY LITTLE SMARTASS, BUT... BUT SHE HAD A BIG HEART. SHE WAS THERE FOR US ALL. HER... SHE'D DO ANYTHING NOW TO MAKE US HAPPY. SHE'D DO FOR ANYBODY, HER KIDS ESPECIALLY. YEAH. HER KIDS WOULD COME FIRST ALL THE TIME. SHE'D COME BACK WITH LOADS OF TOYS. SHE ALWAYS DID FOR HER KIDS. Narrator: LORETTA WAS DETERMINED TO GIVE HER TWO SONS THE KIND OF LIFE SHE NEVER HAD GROWING UP. MY MOM AND DAD, THEY WENT THROUGH A DIVORCE. AFTER THAT, I THINK, THAT'S WHEN... THAT'S WHEN OUR LIFE JUST... YEAH. ...WAS DESTROYED. WE WERE YOUNG, DIDN'T HAVE BOTH PARENTS ANYMORE. WE WERE RUNNING AROUND. THAT'S WHEN WE WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE AND GETTING... YOU KNOW, DOING WHAT WE WANTED. LORETTA FELL INTO THE WILD SIDE PRETTY EARLY. WE WERE YOUNG. WE WERE, LIKE, 13, 14, SHE'S SNEAKING OUT THE WINDOW. SHE FELL IN THE WRONG CROWD. SHE'D DRINK A LOT AND THEN TO THE CRACK AND COCAINE, AND ONCE SHE GOT ON THAT, SHE GOT ADDICTED AND JUST COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM IT. LORETTA CHAISSON LEWIS WAS FOUND HERE. I KNEW HER WELL. I KNEW HER WELL. Narrator: RICKY EDWARDS WAS THE SHERIFF OF JEFFERSON DAVIS PARISH AT THE TIME OF THE DEATHS. SHE WAS A GOOD PERSON, A VERY GOOD PERSON. MADE SOME POOR DECISIONS IN HER LIFE. HER FATHER, I KNOW HIM. I KNOW MOST OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE, AS WE SAY, JENNINGS IS VERY SMALL AND FAIRLY CLOSE-KNIT. IT'S VERY PERSONAL WHEN SOMETHING TRAGIC LIKE THAT HAPPENS. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE, AND THEY ARE STILL IN CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES. WE CAN'T MAKE SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO. YOU SECOND-GUESS AND THINK, "MAYBE I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT," BUT YOU JUST GO ON, AND YOU DO YOUR JOB AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. Narrator: IT'S NO SECRET IN SOUTH JENNINGS THAT LORETTA STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION, AND WHILE HER CAUSE OF DEATH WAS RULED UNDETERMINED, SHE HAD DRUGS IN HER SYSTEM, LEADING MANY TO BELIEVE SHE OVERDOSED. I'VE KNOWN LORETTA SINCE SHE WAS PROBABLY A TEENAGER. ALL LORETTA'S LIFE, SHE WAS A FREE SPIRIT. FROM VERY YOUNG, LORETTA WAS WILD AND CRAZY, SO I REMEMBER WHEN LORETTA'S BODY WAS FOUND. MY MIND DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY THINK HOMICIDE. NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAPPENED. I JUST ASSOCIATED MAYBE A DRUG OVERDOSE WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER BECAUSE HER HISTORY OF DRUG USE WAS PRETTY WELL-KNOWN, SO I JUST ASSUMED THAT THAT'S ALL IT WAS UNTIL PEOPLE STARTED REALIZING THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY DUMPED, THAT SHE HAD TO HAVE BEEN THROWN THERE. I'VE ACTUALLY FISHED THERE BEFORE WITH MY HUSBAND, SO I KNEW THE LOCATION, AND IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS SOMEWHERE WHERE SHE WAS WALKING OR SAT DOWN. IMMEDIATELY, YOU KNOW IT WASN'T JUST AN OVERDOSE. THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF FOUL PLAY INVOLVED. Narrator: IT'S MAY 2005, AND THE BODY OF 28-YEAR-OLD LORETTA CHAISSON LEWIS HAS BEEN FOUND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SMALL TOWN JENNINGS IN LOUISIANA. WELL, WITH LORETTA, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD SEEN HERE BEFORE. THAT'S NOT A NORMAL SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A BODY, YOU KNOW, DOWN IN A WATERWAY. IT HAPPENS, BUT IT'S NOT A NORMAL OCCURRENCE. Narrator: WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE OTHER THAN THE TOXICOLOGY REPORT SHOWING DRUGS IN HER SYSTEM, THE MOST OBVIOUS POSSIBILITY IS THAT LORETTA MAY HAVE OVERDOSED, BUT HER BROTHERS HAVE HEARD OTHER STORIES. THEY HAD ONE STORY THAT SHE WAS BEAT UP, THEN THEY COME, "OH, WELL, I PROMISE YOU. SHE DIDN'T HAVE NO MARKS ON HER. SHE WASN'T BEAT UP. SHE WASN'T CHOKED." AND THERE WAS THE ONE THEORY THAT SHE WAS KILLED IN A MOTEL ROOM, SMOTHERED BY A PILLOW, BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MANY STORIES, YOU KNOW, WE HEARD. SO REALLY AND TRULY, WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WE JUST KNOW WHERE SHE ENDED UP. I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN AN O.D. YEAH. BECAUSE, I MEAN, THE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER HAVING TO BE SCARED FOR HER LIFE AND THAT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, COMING TO AN END, I JUST COULDN'T... I COULDN'T THINK OF IT LIKE THAT. Narrator: ALL LORETTA'S BROTHERS HAVE TO GO ON IS THE LAST TIME THEY SAW HER SHORTLY BEFORE SHE WENT MISSING. SHE WAS AT A LOCAL GAS STATION ALONG WITH A WELL-KNOWN FIXTURE OF THE SOUTH JENNINGS UNDERWORLD. FRANKIE RICHARD PULLS UP. LORETTA GIVES ME A HUG. SHE SAYS SHE LOVES ME. SHE GETS IN THE CAR WITH FRANKIE. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE. I AIN'T NEVER SEEN HER. FRANKIE RICHARD, A KNOWN DRUG USER AND DEALER, IS A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE AROUND TOWN. I'M NOT A VERY JUDGMENTAL PERSON. I DON'T LIKE TO BE. I DON'T LIKE TO JUDGE PEOPLE, BUT I JUST THINK HE'S THE, YOU KNOW... HE'S NO GOOD. THAT'S MY OPINION. BUT NOTHING DIRECTLY LINKS FRANKIE TO LORETTA'S DEATH, AND THE CAUSE IS ULTIMATELY RULED AS UNDETERMINED ON THE AUTOPSY REPORT. STILL, NICK CAN'T SHAKE THE BELIEF THAT THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN AN OVERDOSE. SHE WAS NUMBER ONE, AND THEN THEY WENT FROM THERE, AND ALL THESE OTHER GIRLS JUST DIED. IF YOU CAN'T TELL THAT SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT, THEN... I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING JUST ISN'T RIGHT. SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT. Woman #2: ALL I KNOW IS THEY FOUND A GIRL DOWN THE ROAD. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. Reporter #4: THE PARTIALLY NUDE BODY OF ERNESTINE DANIELS FOUND... Reporter #5: THE BODY OF ERNESTINE MARIE DANIEL PATTERSON WAS FOUND IN A CANAL OFF HIGHWAY 102. SHE DISAPPEARED. ERNESTINE, SHE WAS FOUND IN ANOTHER IRRIGATION CANAL THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES SOUTH OF WHERE LORETTA WAS. Narrator: BOTH OF THE WOMEN'S BODIES HAD BEEN DISPOSED OF IN A CANAL, BOTH WITH DRUGS IN THEIR SYSTEMS, BUT THIS TIME, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE CAUSE OF DEATH. ERNESTINE'S THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT, AND HER BRUISED HANDS SUGGEST A BRUTAL STRUGGLE. TRAUMA TO THE BODY WAS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT, BUT YOU ALWAYS PUT THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD, THAT THEY COULD BE CONNECTED, AND JUST BEING THE WAY THEY WERE DISPOSED OF, DUMPED, WE KIND OF FIGURED THAT WE HAD SOMETHING THAT WE NEEDED TO CONNECT THE DOTS REAL QUICK. Narrator: ERNESTINE'S DEATH, LIKE LORETTA'S, IS A SHOCK TO THE COMMUNITY AND DEVASTATING FOR HER FAMILY. SHE WAS A CARING, LOVING PERSON. SHE WAS FUN TO BE AROUND, TO TALK TO. YEAH. SHE STAYED IN CHURCH ALL THE TIME, GOING TO CHURCH. YEAH, WE WENT TO CHURCH A WHOLE LOT. TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK. I CAN'T REST AT NIGHT. IT HURTS A LOT. IT BOTHERS ME. IT HURTS. SHE JUST HAD A GOOD HEART. SHE WAS A CHRISTIAN. SHE HAD FIVE KIDS, AND, I MEAN, SHE WAS A GOOD, LOVING PERSON. AFTER THE SECOND ONE, WE HAD BROUGHT OUTSIDE AGENCIES IN TO LOOK AT TO SEE IF THEY WERE RELATED, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A BLACK FEMALE AND A WHITE FEMALE. WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THIS, AND THIS PERSON OR PERSONS WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. Narrator: BUT JUST TWO MONTHS LATER, HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA RIP THROUGH LOUISIANA. Cormier: IN AUGUST OF 2005, HURRICANE KATRINA HIT IN NEW ORLEANS, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM THAT AREA EVACUATED. ONE OF THE PLACES THEY CAME WAS HERE, IN JENNINGS. THAT TOOK A TOLL ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS TO DEAL WITH THAT EMERGENCY SITUATION AND TRY TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE PEOPLE. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, A HOMICIDE IS A VERY HIGH-PRIORITY INVESTIGATION, BUT WHEN WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO IMMEDIATE SITUATIONS AS LAW ENFORCEMENT, FIRST RESPONDERS, SOMETIMES INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL WE GET EVERYBODY TAKEN CARE OF AND SECURE AND SAFE, AND THEN WE GO BACK TO DOING INVESTIGATIONS. Narrator: IN DECEMBER 2005, SIX MONTHS AFTER ERNESTINE'S MURDER, INVESTIGATORS FINALLY GET A BREAK WHEN WITNESSES POINT THEM TO TWO SUSPECTS, LAWRENCE NIXON AND HIS FRIEND BYRON CHAD JONES. I DON'T KNOW BYRON CHAD JONES. LAWRENCE NIXON WENT TO SCHOOL WITH TAYLOR, SO I KNEW LAWRENCE NIXON. HE WAS ACTUALLY AN EXTREMELY AWESOME FOOTBALL PLAYER IN JENNINGS HIGH, PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THAT THEY EVER HAD. SO THERE WEREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS. Narrator: WITNESSES TELL POLICE THEY SAW NIXON AND JONES PARTYING WITH ERNESTINE THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED AND THAT THINGS MAY HAVE TURNED VIOLENT. THEY SAY JONES AND NIXON WERE SEEN LATER THAT NIGHT COVERED IN BLOOD THEN MOVING A LARGE AND HEAVY TRASH BAG FROM NIXON'S PORCH INTO THE TRUCK OF A WHITE CAR. Cormier: I CAN'T GET INTO SPECIFICS. JUST THERE WAS ENOUGH INFORMATION THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION THAT WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN WARRANTS ON LAWRENCE NIXON AND BYRON CHAD JONES, AND THEN THEY WERE INDICTED IN 2006. Narrator: BOTH MEN PLEAD NOT GUILTY, BUT THE CASE SUFFERS A SETBACK WHEN FORENSIC TESTING OF NIXON'S PORCH FAILS TO FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF BLOOD AND THEN A STUNNING REVERSAL. Cormier: THERE WAS A WITNESS THAT RECANTED HIS STATEMENT, HAD A DIFFERENT STATEMENT TO SOME DEGREE, HAD DIFFERENT INFORMATION, SO THEN IT, YOU KNOW, IT CREATES A LEGAL ISSUE BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE, "OKAY, WELL, WHICH STATEMENT IS THE ACCURATE STATEMENT?" Narrator: UNRELIABLE WITNESSES AND A LACK OF EVIDENCE RESULTS IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DROPPING THE CHARGES FOR ERNESTINE'S MURDER. IN LOUISIANA, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY PROSECUTES A CASE WHEN HE BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE SUBMITTED INDICATES THAT HE CAN PROVE THAT CASE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. Lewis: THE TWO WERE HELD IN JAIL FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE CHARGES WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, SO THAT IF MORE INFORMATION CAME FORTH LATER, THEY COULD BE RE-ARRESTED. YOU KNOW, WE GET THAT A LOT IN EVERY INVESTIGATION. "WELL, I KNOW WHO DID IT." WELL, SOMETIMES, WE KNOW WHO DID IT, TOO, BUT THE D.A. WON'T BE ABLE TO PROVE THEY DID IT BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE, SO IT KIND OF COMES TO AN IMPASSE. Narrator: WITH THE INVESTIGATION BACK TO SQUARE ONE, ERNESTINE'S FAMILY AND LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE LEFT FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY. Jessica: I KNOW THEY SAY THEY'RE ARRESTING THEM, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE NO EVIDENCE, NO PROOF. THEY LET THEM GO. NO EVIDENCE, NO NOTHING, NO TRACE. Narrator: AS THE MONTHS PASS WITHOUT ANY NEW INFORMATION, THE TOWN SETTLES BACK INTO THE EASY RHYTHMS OF SOUTHERN LIFE, THEN ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER, THE HORROR CONTINUES. I REMEMBER FINDING OUT THAT THE POLICE WERE PULLING A BODY OUT OF THE WATER. Narrator: IT'S BEEN 21 MONTHS SINCE THE BRUTAL MURDER OF ERNESTINE PATTERSON AND THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF LORETTA LEWIS. THE SMALL TOWN OF JENNINGS HAS TRIED TO MOVE ON, BUT ANOTHER DEVASTATING DISCOVERY MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE NIGHTMARE IS NOT OVER. Reporter #6: THE BODY OF 21-YEAR-OLD KRISTEN ELIZABETH GARY LOPEZ WAS FOUND IN THE PETITJEAN CANAL SOUTH OF WELSH. Narrator: KRISTEN LOPEZ HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 12 DAYS WHEN HER BODY IS FOUND FACEDOWN IN A CANAL IN A SECLUDED AREA ABOUT 14 MILES SOUTH OF JENNINGS. Cormier: THE FIRST TWO CASES HAPPENED IN 2005, AND THEN YOU GO THROUGH, YOU KNOW, SOME TIME. 2006, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CASES, AND THEN THIRD VICTIM, KRISTEN GARY LOPEZ COMES UP, AND, ONCE AGAIN, IT'S A FEMALE FOUND IN WATER. Lewis: THERE WERE SUCH CLOSE TIES BETWEEN THE WAYS THE BODIES WERE FOUND, IN BODIES OF WATER, IT WAS KIND OF LIKE, "WOW, THAT'S REALLY MESSED UP." Narrator: KRISTEN IS COMPLETELY NUDE EXCEPT FOR A WHITE SOCK ON HER RIGHT FOOT. AS WITH LORETTA, HER BODY IS TOO DECOMPOSED TO DETERMINE HER CAUSE OF DEATH, BUT TOXICOLOGY SHOWS SHE ALSO HAD DRUGS IN HER SYSTEM. Jones: SHE HAD BEEN MISSING FOR SO LONG. THE CONDITION HER BODY WAS IN WAS NOT A SECRET. WE LIVE IN LOUISIANA, SO OUR WEATHER CONDITIONS INTENSIFY THAT, AND WHERE HER BODY WAS, THERE WAS ALLIGATORS. SHE WAS MY BABY. Jones: I FELT SORRY FOR HER MOM. AS A MOTHER, YOU NEVER WANT TO BURY YOUR CHILDREN, AND YOU NEVER WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO SUFFER. OH, I WAKE UP WITH HER ON MY MIND. I GO TO BED WITH HER ON MY MIND. SHE'S MY LIFE. I MEAN, SHE'S GONE, AND I HAVE NO CLOSURE, NO ANSWERS. IT'S JUST HARD, I MEAN. Jones: SHE WAS A VERY SWEET GIRL. SHE WAS A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY. SHE WAS EVERYWHERE, AND SHE CAME FROM A VERY GOOD FAMILY, AND SHE WAS VERY LOVED, AND SHE SHOWED IT. SHE WAS... YOU COULD TELL. SHE WAS GENUINELY A GOOD FRIEND TO EVERYBODY SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH. Narrator: HANNAH CONNER WAS ONE OF KRISTEN'S CLOSEST FRIENDS, A WOMAN SHE CONSIDERED FAMILY. KRISTEN WAS... SHE WAS A REAL SWEET PERSON. SHE WAS A REAL... ALWAYS A KID AT HEART, YOU KNOW, SO IT REALLY BROKE US WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT SOMEBODY HAD DONE THAT TO HER. SHE WAS THROWN AWAY, YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE SHE WAS NOTHING, JUST THROWN AWAY TO BE EATEN ON. IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE. SORRY. KRISTEN ALWAYS HAD THIS INNOCENCE ABOUT HER. SHE WASN'T OUT TO GET NOBODY. SHE WASN'T OUT TO HURT NOBODY. SHE WAS A GREAT PERSON. MY DAD AND HER DAD WERE REAL GOOD FRIENDS GROWING UP. KRISTEN'S MOM, WHO I VIEWED AS AN AUNT, THEY WERE JUST PART OF OUR LITTLE FAMILY UNIT, YOU KNOW. Narrator: PART OF THIS FAMILY UNIT INCLUDED HANNAH'S FATHER, BILLY CONNER, AND HIS HALF-BROTHER, FRANKIE RICHARD, THE SAME FRANKIE RICHARD WHO ALSO KNEW THE FIRST VICTIM, LORETTA LEWIS. Conner: WE ALWAYS HAD BIG, MASSIVE BIRTHDAY PARTIES. MY GRANDMA WOULD BARBECUE. WE'D HAVE, LIKE, A MILLION KIDS IN THE BACKYARD PLAYING TAG. WE'D DO RELAY RACES. WE'D JUST RUN AROUND WITH BALLOONS IN BETWEEN OUR LEGS AND TRY TO SEE WHO COULD GET THE FURTHEST. WE HAD A BLAST. WE HAD A GREAT FAMILY-ORIENTED TIME, YOU KNOW. Narrator: BUT DESPITE THE GOOD TIMES, MEMBERS OF BOTH FAMILIES WERE BATTLING ADDICTION. Conner: IT WAS PRETTY WELL-KNOWN THAT SHE WAS REALLY BAD ON DRUGS. WE PRETTY MUCH ALL WERE. IT'S JUST WHAT WE WERE SURROUNDED BY. THAT'S WHAT WE KNEW. YOU KNOW, WE SEEN OUR PARENTS DO DRUGS. ALL OF OUR FRIENDS ENDED UP TURNING TO DRUGS, TOO. Narrator: AND EVERYONE'S FAVORITE PLACE TO PARTY WAS BILLY CONNER'S CAMPER PARKED NEXT TO FRANKIE RICHARD'S HOUSE. Conner: MY FATHER, HE WAS A GOOD MAN. HIS PLACE WAS KIND OF LIKE THE SAFE ZONE, I ALWAYS FELT, AND I THINK A LOT OF THE GIRLS FELT THAT WAY. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF GIRLS THAT WENT AND VISITED WITH MY DAD AND PARTIED WITH MY DAD, THAT'S WHERE THEY WENT. Narrator: KRISTEN WAS OFTEN SEEN AT BILLY'S TRAILER, BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE SHE WAS HEADING THE LAST TIME HANNAH SAW HER. Conner: THE LAST TIME I HAD SEEN HER, SHE ASKED ME FOR A RIDE TO HER FRIEND'S HOUSE. SHE ALWAYS NEEDED A RIDE OR NEEDED TO BORROW SOME CLOTHES, YOU KNOW, OR JUST SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SHE GOT IN A VAN. I REMEMBER HER TELLING ME SHE HAD JUST GOT BEATEN UP RECENTLY. SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY BEAT HER UP WITH A PAIR OF BRASS KNUCKLES, AND SHE PICKED UP HER SHIRT, AND SHE HAD BRUISES ON HER CHEST, ON HER BELLY. AND THEN I DROPPED HER OFF, AND THAT WAS THE LAST I'VE SEEN OF HER. Interviewer: DID SHE SAY WHY SOMEBODY HAD BEATEN HER UP? THEY CAUGHT HER STEALING. THEY CAUGHT HER STEALING SOME MONEY OR SOMETHING FROM THEM. DID SHE TELL YOU WHO IT WAS? NO. Narrator: SHORTLY AFTER HANNAH LAST SAW HER, KRISTEN'S PARENTS FILE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT. Conner: HER MOM HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR HER AND HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER. I WAS JUST THINKING HER MOM MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN BEING A LITTLE PARANOID BECAUSE OF THE OTHER GIRLS THAT HAD COME UP MISSING. I, YOU KNOW, I REALLY JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST ON A BENDER SOMEWHERE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL FOR HER TO BE MISSING FOR A COUPLE DAYS, YOU KNOW. MAYBE SHE HAD JUST LEFT TOWN, MET SOME GUYS AND LEFT TOWN WITH THEM AND WAS COMING BACK. Narrator: THOUGH THE CORONER CANNOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF KRISTEN'S DEATH, IT IS TREATED AS A HOMICIDE. Cormier: ANY TIME YOU HAVE A SUSPICIOUS DEATH OR A DEATH THAT YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH OR YOU DON'T HAVE CREDIBLE INFORMATION TO DISCOUNT A HOMICIDE, YOU'RE TRAINED TO WORK EVERY DEATH AS A HOMICIDE. Narrator: AND THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE WOMEN'S DEATHS STOKE INCREASING ANXIETY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF JENNINGS. THE WAY THE BODIES ARE FOUND AND THE WAY THERE'S SO MANY SIMILARITIES, IT STRIKES THE NORMAL PERSON AS BEING A VERY ORGANIZED SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THEM ARE FOUND IN SIMILAR MONTHS, YOU KNOW, MARCH AND MAY. THE CONDITIONS OF THE BODIES WHEN THEY'RE FOUND, THEY'RE ALL FOUND OUT IN THE OPEN. THEY'RE ALL FOUND OUT IN THE OUTDOORS. IT JUST HAS THOSE HALLMARKS OF SOMETHING THAT'S VERY KIND OF METICULOUS AND EVOLVING. AT THAT POINT, EVERYONE STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAD AN ISSUE HERE. SOMETHING IS WRONG. THEY'RE BEING TARGETED. THE COMMUNITY WAS BASICALLY OUTRAGED. Conner: THE WHOLE TOWN, IT HAD A FEAR AND PARANOIA FOR EVERYBODY. I WAS TERRIFIED TO GO WALK ANYWHERE ALONE AT NIGHT. I WAS SCARED, YOU KNOW, IF I'D SEEN THE SAME TRUCK DRIVE BY ME MORE THAN THREE TIMES WHEN I'M WALKING DOWN THE ROAD. I'D BE ON THE LOOKOUT. Jones: THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE OUT HERE. WE HAD NEVER HAD THIS MANY MURDERS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. Conner: NOT ONLY WERE YOU SCARED OF THESE STRANGE MEN DRIVING AROUND TOWN, YOU ALSO HAD A FEAR OF TRUSTING ANYBODY. Narrator: WITH THREE WOMEN FOUND DEAD IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, THE SMALL TOWN OF JENNINGS IS IN THE GRIP OF RISING PANIC. TWO MONTHS AFTER KRISTEN LOPEZ'S BODY IS DUMPED IN THE PETITJEAN CANAL, NEWS OF ANOTHER TERRIBLE DISCOVERY SPREADS THROUGH THE TOWN. Reporter #3: WHAT INVESTIGATORS FOUND AT THE INTERSECTION OF BOBBY AND EARL DUHON ROAD IS THE BODY OF A WOMAN. Narrator: ON MAY 12, 2007, POLICE VISIT THE DUBOIS FAMILY HOME TO TELL THEM THAT 26-YEAR-OLD WHITNEI DUBOIS HAS BEEN FOUND NAKED, DEAD AND DUMPED. SHE IS THE FOURTH VICTIM, BUT THE SITE WHERE SHE WAS DUMPED IS NOTABLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER WOMEN. Cormier: SHE WAS FOUND ON A ROADWAY. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER VICTIMS. IT'S THE FIRST VICTIM THAT ACTUALLY PUT IN MORE OF A PUBLIC PLACE WHERE, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S MORE CHANCE OF THE BODY BEING FOUND, ESPECIALLY QUICKER THAN IT WOULD BE IF YOU PUT IT IN A WATERWAY LIKE THE OTHERS WERE. AS AN INVESTIGATOR, YOU START TRYING TO DETERMINE IS THERE ANY MEANING TO THAT? WE DEFINITELY KNEW THAT WE HAD SOME KIND OF ANOMALY HERE THAT WAS HAPPENING, AND WE SCRAMBLED TO TRY TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER. Narrator: WHITNEI'S BODY WAS FOUND ABOUT 5 MILES OUTSIDE JENNINGS AND CLOSE TO WHERE THE PREVIOUS THREE VICTIMS WERE FOUND. I THINK THIS WAS MORE CONFIDENT ON THE KILLER'S PART, THAT HE FELT VERY COMFORTABLE IN WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE TIME. Narrator: WHILE INVESTIGATORS WORK TO ESTABLISH THE POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CASES, WHITNEI'S FAMILY TAKES THE INITIATIVE, TRYING TO PUT THE PUZZLE PIECES TOGETHER. WE STARTED DIGGING FOR OUR OWN INFORMATION PROBABLY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY, YEAH. WE WERE KIND OF ABLE TO PUT A SERIES OF EVENTS TOGETHER. BETWEEN WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY, ABOUT MIDNIGHT, SHE WENT TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S, AND SHE WAS HUNGRY. MY GRANDMA FED HER. SHE WANTED TO STAY THERE AND SPEND THE NIGHT, BUT MY GRANDMA TOLD WHITNEI THAT SHE COULDN'T SPEND THE NIGHT THERE, AND HER AND MY GRANDMOTHER HAD AN ARGUMENT, AND SHE LEFT WALKING. HER NEXT STOP WAS BILLY AND FRANKIE'S HOUSE. THE WAY THAT LOCATION IS SET UP IS FRANKIE AND BILLY'S MOM LIVES IN THE HOUSE RIGHT THERE IN FRONT, AND THEN IN THE BACK BEHIND THE DRIVEWAY IS A SMALL CAMPER, AND THAT'S WHERE BILLY CONNER LIVES. BILLY WAS A NICE GUY. BILLY WAS A VERY KIND-HEARTED MAN, SO I'M PRETTY SURE WHITNEI KNEW THAT SHE COULD GO TO BILLY'S, AND SHE HAD A PLACE TO LAY HER HEAD AT LEAST FOR THE NIGHT. I'M ASSUMING SHE WAS LOOKING FOR DRUGS AS WELL, AND BILLY WAS THE GO-TO. JUST LIKE LORETTA, ERNESTINE AND KRISTEN, WHITNEI WAS STRUGGLING WITH DRUG ADDICTION. Taylor: I KNEW THAT SHE DABBLED WITH THE PILLS, AND I KNEW THAT SHE SMOKED MARIJUANA, BUT IT WASN'T AN EVERYDAY THING, LIKE, IT WASN'T A "GOT TO HAVE." WHEN SHE HAD BEYONCE, SHE HAD A C-SECTION, AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION. HER INCISION AT THE END HAD STARTED TO GET RED, AND SHE WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN. I REMEMBER TAKING HER TO THE DOCTOR, AND HE LOOKED AT IT, AND HE SAID, "I THINK IT'S GETTING INFECTED." SHE WAS PRESCRIBED PAIN MEDICINE THEN. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE DIDN'T START HER DAY, AND SHE DIDN'T FUNCTION, WITHOUT SOME MEDICINE. THAT'S PROBABLY WHEN I KNEW SHE HAD A PROBLEM. WHITNEI DISTANCED HERSELF A LOT FROM US AFTER SHE GOT REALLY HEAVY INTO THE DRUGS BECAUSE... I THINK... ...SHE WAS ASHAMED. ...IN HER WORLD, SHE MAY HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY, BUT SHE KIND OF PORTRAYED TO US... YEAH. ...THAT SHE WAS SO THAT WE WOULDN'T... I KNOW THE LAST TIME I SAW HER... ...QUESTION OR... ...SHE WAS VERY HAPPY. HER AND HER BOYFRIEND HAD PLANS TO BUY A HOUSE, GET OFF THE DRUGS, AND BASICALLY, IN THEIR MIND, THEY HAD A HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER PICTURE PLANNED. BUT HAPPILY EVER AFTER NEVER CAME. ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER BRITTNEY SAW HER, WHITNEI DUBOIS IS FOUND DEAD. AS WITH LORETTA AND KRISTEN, FRANKIE RICHARD IS ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE TO SEE WHITNEI ALIVE. I MET WHITNEI RIGHT HERE IN THE DRIVEWAY. SHE WAS GOING TO MY BROTHER'S CAMPER, HAD A FRIEND THAT WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE WITH ME. ME AND MY FRIEND LEFT. WE WENT DOWN HERE, DOWN THE ROAD WHERE HE STAYED, AND WHEN WE GOT BACK RIGHT HERE, WHITNEY WAS OVER THERE BY THE STOP SIGN, RIGHT OVER THERE BY HOBART AND McKINLEY, AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SEEN WHITNEI. THAT'S THE STORY THAT I'VE ALWAYS HEARD, THAT SHE WENT TO THE CAMPER AND THEN DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR, AND THEN TWO DAYS LATER, SHE'S ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH NO CLOTHES ON. AND THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. THERE'S BIG PATCHES MISSING IN BETWEEN. I DON'T KNOW WHO DONE IT. I WISH I DID KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW. FRANKIE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NO-GOOD CREEP TO ME. I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT HIM. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM DO ANYTHING GOOD. I LIKED BILLY. I ALWAYS DID. I SPOKE TO BILLY AFTER WHITNEI DIED. BILLY CRIED, AND HE TOLD ME, "I WOULD NEVER HURT YOUR SISTER. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. I LOVED YOUR GRANDPARENTS. I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT THEM," AND HE SEEMED SINCERE. Narrator: BILLY CONNER DIED IN 2014 WITHOUT SHEDDING ANY FURTHER LIGHT ON WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. WHITNEI'S DEATH RAMPS UP THE PRESSURE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT EVEN HIGHER TO PROTECT THE WOMEN OF JENNINGS AND MAKE AN ARREST. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A SMALL COMMUNITY LIKE JENNINGS. IT HAS CAUSED CONCERN. YOU KNOW, THIS IS NUMBER FOUR. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON. WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYES OPEN MORE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. Narrator: THREE DAYS AFTER WHITNEI'S BODY IS DISCOVERED, POLICE FINALLY GET A BREAK IN THE KRISTEN LOPEZ CASE. Reporter: THIS IS A "7 NEWS" SPECIAL REPORT. WE'RE BLESSED THAT SOMEBODY HAS COME FORWARD. Peck: JEFF DAVIS PARISH SHERIFF RICKY EDWARDS SAYS A TIP FROM INFORMANTS GAVE INVESTIGATORS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO ARREST TWO PEOPLE WITH LOPEZ'S MURDER. Narrator: ONE OF THOSE ARRESTED IS NO SURPRISE TO THE SOUTH JENNINGS COMMUNITY. IT'S FRANKIE RICHARD, WHO IS ALREADY IN JAIL ON AN UNRELATED CHARGE. MR. RICHARD WAS INCARCERATED MONDAY ON A RAPE THAT HAD OCCURRED EARLIER THAT DAY. Narrator: BUT THE OTHER ARREST COMES AS A SHOCK TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE SUSPECT HERSELF. Peck: 22-YEAR-OLD HANNAH CONNER WAS ARRESTED THIS MORNING IN VERMILION PARISH. I HEARD KRISTEN WAS MISSING, SO I CONTACTED THE POLICE. I THOUGHT I WAS TRYING TO HELP THE SITUATION, BEING THIS IS MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW? THIS IS SOMEBODY I WAS CLOSE WITH, AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I AM BEING ARRESTED FOR MURDER OF KRISTEN. AFTER THAT, IT'S JUST A BLUR. MY EMOTIONS WERE EVERYWHERE. Narrator: THE POLICE INFORMANT IS TRACEE CHAISSON, KRISTEN'S GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH. Peck: THE STATEMENT OF TRACEE CHAISSON TURNED THE EYES OF INVESTIGATORS TOWARD FRANKIE AND HIS NIECE, HANNAH CONNER. WHILE BOTH FACE SECOND-DEGREE MURDER CHARGES FOR LOPEZ'S DEATH, THEY'RE ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEATHS OF LORETTA LYNN CHAISSON, ERNESTINE PATTERSON, AND WHITNEI DUBOIS, WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND SATURDAY. Chaisson: LORETTA WAS MY FIRST COUSIN. KRISTEN WAS MY GIRLFRIEND, AND THE REST OF THEM, I KNEW FROM THE STREETS. Conner: TRACEE CHAISSON, YEAH, WE HUNG OUT IN SOME OF THE SAME CIRCLES, SAME CIRCLES BEING MY DAD, FRANKIE, KRISTEN. YOU KNOW, WE KNEW SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE. HER AND KRISTEN, I THINK, AT ONE POINT, WERE ACTUALLY AN ITEM, BUT AS FAR AS BEING FRIENDS, I CAN'T SAY WE WERE EVER CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE, LIKE, FRIENDS AND BUDDIES AND HANGING OUT. I REALLY COULDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING PERSONAL ABOUT HER, YOU KNOW? Narrator: ON THE DAY OF HER ARREST, JENNINGS POLICE BRING HANNAH INTO THE INTERROGATION ROOM. Conner: THEY TOOK ME INTO THE INTERROGATION ROOM. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WAS THERE. THEY STARTED ASKING ME QUESTIONS, BOMBARDING ME WITH QUESTIONS, YOU KNOW, TIME LINE THIS, TIME LINE THAT. I WAS TERRIFIED. HERE I AM. I'M A YOUNG KID, EARLY 20s, BUT I WAS DOING DRUGS, AND I WAS PARTYING, YOU KNOW? AND I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT, BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF NEVER GETTING OUT? THAT'S WHAT WAS TERRIFYING, JUST A LOT OF WORRY, A LOT OF STRESS. THEY ASKED, "WHO DID KRISTEN HANG OUT WITH?" THEY WERE ASKING ME WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SEEN HER. HOW CLOSE WERE WE? AND THEY KEPT ASKING ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER IF I WAS SCARED OF FRANKIE. THEY WERE WILLING TO DROP MY SENTENCE FROM SECOND-DEGREE MURDER TO A FIVE-YEAR MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE IF I TOLD THEM THAT FRANKIE WAS INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, I WAS THERE, AND FRANKIE DID IT. Narrator: HANNAH CLAIMS SHE HAS AN ALIBI ON THE NIGHT KRISTEN WENT MISSING. Conner: THE NIGHT IN QUESTION, I WAS ACTUALLY THROWING A BIRTHDAY PARTY AT MY HOUSE. ME, MY BROTHER, MY MOM, MY GRANDMA, AND EVERYBODY DRINKING AND HAVING A BLAST, YOU KNOW? Narrator: BUT TRACEE TELLS POLICE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. TRACEE CHAISSON HAD SAID THAT... TRACEE SAID THAT FRANKIE, CONNIE, ME, TRACEE, AND KRISTEN WERE ALL RIDING AROUND GETTING HIGH TOGETHER. FRANKIE AND KRISTEN START FIGHTING, AND FRANKIE BEAT KRISTEN UP. HE HADN'T KILLED HER. TRACEE WAS SCREAMING, "NO, STOP!" YOU KNOW, WHATEVER... LIKE, SHE DIDN'T WANT THIS TO OCCUR, AND I HELD KRISTEN UNDERWATER AND, YOU KNOW, FINISHED HER OFF, BUT, YEAH, THAT WAS HER STORY. THAT'S JUST WHAT THE POLICE TOLD ME. THEY BELIEVE THAT I WAS THERE AND WHAT TRACEE SAID WAS TRUE, BUT THEY WERE TELLING ME, THERE'S NO REASON FOR TRACEE TO BE LYING. YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD SOMEBODY LIE ON YOU THIS BAD OF A LIE, YOU KNOW? THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF TRUTH IN IT. DO... YOU KNOW? THEY REALLY THOUGHT THAT I WAS JUST PROTECTING FRANKIE, I BELIEVE. Narrator: LIKE HANNAH, FRANKIE RICHARD HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH KRISTEN AND HER FAMILY. Peck: JUST BEFORE HER DISAPPEARANCE, KRISTEN, ALONG WITH TRACEE CHAISSON AND A WOMAN NAMED CONNIE SILER, VISITED UNCLE FRANKIE IN HIS ROOM AT THE JENNINGS BUDGET INN, WHERE HE WAS STAYING. Narrator: FRANKIE ADMITS HE SAW KRISTEN WITH TRACEE AND CONNIE IN THE HOURS LEADING UP TO HER DISAPPEARANCE. YOU KNOW? AND, YOU KNOW... Reporter: LAST WEEK, THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ARRESTED FRANKIE RICHARD FOR SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. WITNESSES SAY THE 52-YEAR-OLD WAS SEEN WITH THREE OF THE FOUR GIRLS SHORTLY BEFORE THEY DIED. HE IS INVOLVED IN THE LAST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES. NOW, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I'M STILL NOT SURE, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO INVESTIGATE AND FIND OUT. Reporter: ...WHERE A NEW POLL SHOWS POSSIBLE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MIKE HUCKABEE COULD CHALLENGE PRESIDENT OBAMA. FRANKIE RICHARD... HIS NAME SEEMS TO BE ON EVERYBODY'S LIPS. ANYWHERE YOU GO, "YOU NEED TO TALK TO FRANKIE RICHARD. WE THINK HE'S INVOLVED." WELL, WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH FRANKIE RICHARD. FRANKIE, YOUR NAME KEEPS COMING UP FOR WHATEVER REASON IN THIS INVESTIGATION, AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL YOU A SUSPECT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT? I THINK IT'S CRAZY, YOU KNOW? I KNEW ALL THE GIRLS. EVERY LAST ONE OF THESE GIRLS, I'VE GOTTEN HIGH WITH. Woman: I MEAN, ARE YOU A CRACK ADDICT? AM I A CRACK ADDICT? I'VE SMOKED CRACK FOR 20 YEARS. NOW, WAS THEY HOOKED ON CRACK? YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SAY THEY WAS HOOKED ON CRACK, BUT WE ALL GOT HIGH. Peck: I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT OUT OF ALL THE INTERVIEWS WE DID, HIS WAS PROBABLY THE MOST TELLING, AND HE WAS THE MOST HONEST AND THE MOST DIRECT. HE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS FROM, DID HE DO DRUGS WITH THE GIRLS? DID HE KNOW THE GIRLS? DID HE SLEEP WITH THE GIRLS? - NO. HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH ANY OF THESE GIRLS? YES, I HAVE. HOW MANY OF THEM? UH...[ SIGHS ] ALMOST ALL OF THEM. Peck: ON THE SURFACE, IT SEEMS LIKE HE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT TO HIDE, BUT YOU CAN'T DENY THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "YEAH. HE'S INVOLVED," 'CAUSE HE KNEW EVERY ONE OF THESE GIRLS, SOME OF WHICH HE SAW DURING THE FINAL HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE... THEIR BODIES WERE DISCOVERED. SO, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER. DO I THINK HE DID IT? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. Narrator: POLICE HAVE ARRESTED FRANKIE RICHARD AND HANNAH CONNER AFTER INFORMANT TRACEE CHAISSON ALLEGES THEY KILLED HER GIRLFRIEND, KRISTEN LOPEZ, BUT 10 DAYS AFTER THE ARRESTS, THE CASE TAKES A DRAMATIC TURN. I WAS RELEASED BECAUSE TRACEE RECANTED HER STATEMENT AND SAID THAT SHE LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID WAS DONE. I PUT FRANKIE RICHARD AND HANNAH CONNER IN JAIL FOR ABOUT A WEEK, AND I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF, SO AND I WENT BACK AND TOLD THEM THAT I LIED. I MADE UP A STORY SO THE JENNINGS POLICE WOULD... JENNINGS DETECTIVES WOULD LEAVE ME ALONE. SHE GAVE AN INTERVIEW SAYING THAT SHE MADE SOME MISLEADING STATEMENTS, BUT THE DETAILS OF IT, I DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE 'CAUSE IT'S STILL ONGOING. ANYTIME YOU HAVE ANY WITNESS THAT CHANGES THEIR STATEMENT, THAT ALWAYS CAUSES ISSUES. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHICH INFORMATION IS ACCURATE? AND THAT'S WHAT'S FRUSTRATING. Narrator: TRACEE CHAISSON IS CHARGED WITH ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT, BUT THE CHARGE IS LATER DROPPED. NO CHARGES ARE BROUGHT AGAINST CONNIE SILER. HANNAH CONNER IS RELEASED FROM JAIL AFTER TRACEE RECANTS HER STATEMENT, BUT FRANKIE REMAINS INCARCERATED UNTIL THE RAPE CHARGE IS DROPPED, AND INVESTIGATORS ARE LEFT WITH NO CLEAR PATH TO THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS, I KNOW NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW NOTHING. THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS. Narrator: BUT FRANKIE SAYS THAT SOMETIME AFTER KRISTEN WAS KILLED, TRACEE CAME TO HIM WITH A SHOCKING CONFESSION ABOUT WHO REALLY KILLED KRISTEN. YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW? I'M TRULY SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID AND WHAT I DID, BUT IF I KNEW SOMETHING... I'D LOVE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO TRACEE. WHY WOULD SHE EVEN GIVE A STORY ABOUT HERSELF BEING THERE IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO? TO ME, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WAS SHE THERE? I WONDER ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME. Jones: I NEVER SAW TRACEE AS A MURDERER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT I DID KNOW THAT TRACEE HAD A HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE AND HAD BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL AND HAD SEEN AND DONE A WHOLE LOT IN HER LIFETIME. GET THE [BLEEP] OUT MY FACE, AND DON'T COME BACK. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF THE CHARGES, SUSPICIONS ABOUT HANNAH AND FRANKIE STILL RUN HIGH IN JENNINGS. I WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTER THAT, YOU KNOW? I COULDN'T GO INTO TOWN AND... [EXHALES SHARPLY] ...WITHOUT HAVING THIS FEELING OF DREAD AROUND ME, YOU KNOW? I KNEW EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ME AS A MURDERER FROM THAT POINT ON. I MOVED AWAY FROM JENNINGS. STILL TO THIS DAY, I CAN'T EVEN GO IN THAT TOWN. JENNINGS IS NOT A HAPPY PLACE FOR ME ANYMORE. Caiman: WE'VE LOST FRIENDS, I MEAN, EVERYTHING. MY LITTLE SISTER WAS CRYING IN SCHOOL BEHIND IT STILL BECAUSE GIRLS WERE SAYING THAT MY DADDY WAS A KILLER AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SO WHAT THE PUBLIC, AND WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHEN THEY SAY, "OH, FRANKIE KILLED THEM GIRLS," OR... BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM. IT AFFECTS OUR LIVES. IT AFFECTS THE WAY WE LIVE. THAT REALLY AFFECTED ME, YOU KNOW? IT REALLY, REALLY, REALLY HURT. YOUR FATHER IS GETTING ACCUSED OF KILLING SOMEBODY. HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT AS A KID? YOU KNOW, LIKE, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE ACTUALLY DID IT? IS HE CAPABLE OF IT? YOU KNOW, LIKE, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT HE REALLY COULD'VE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH? LIKE, NOBODY WANTS TO EVEN HEAR THAT ABOUT THEIR FATHER. I REMEMBER BEING IN SIXTH GRADE AND THE KIDS PICKING ON ME ABOUT MY DAD SUPPOSEDLY BEING A KILLER, AND I REMEMBER FIGHTING AND GETTING KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FROM SIXTH GRADE THROUGH NINTH, EACH YEAR. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. WE DIDN'T KNOW NO BETTER. WE DIDN'T DO NOTHING, BUT WE WAS BEING TARGETED BECAUSE OF WHO OUR FATHER WAS AND BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE HE WAS INVOLVED WITH. Caiman: ONE THING I ALWAYS REMEMBER, EVERY TIME I'D ASKED HIM IF HE'D EVER KILLED SOMEBODY, HE WOULD TELL ME, "SON, THERE'S SECRETS A MAN SHOULD TAKE TO HIS GRAVE WITH HIM, AND LATER ON IN LIFE, YOU'LL LEARN WHAT I MEAN BY THAT." Lauren: HOPEFULLY, ONE DAY IF HE DOES SPEAK ABOUT IT, I WISH HE WOULD, JUST TO GIVE SOME KIND OF JUSTICE TO THESE GIRLS, I MEAN, 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T DESERVE IT. THAT'S MY DADDY, AND I LOVE HIM. DO I BELIEVE HE DONE IT? NO. DO I BELIEVE HE KNOWS SOMETHING? YES, I DO. EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMETHING. NOBODY WANTS TO TALK. [ TRACK BELL RINGING ] [ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS ] Narrator: IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE THE MYSTERIOUS DEATHS OF WHITNEI DUBOIS AND KRISTEN LOPEZ AND THREE YEARS FOR ERNESTINE PATTERSON AND LORETTA LEWIS. FOUR WOMEN FOUND DUMPED IN THE SMALL TOWN OF JENNINGS, LOUISIANA, AND POLICE ARE STILL NO CLOSER TO FINDING ANSWERS. WE HAVE SOMEBODY OUT HERE THAT IS KILLING THESE WOMEN. WE HAD NEVER HAD THIS MANY MURDERS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. Narrator: THEN ON MAY 29, 2008, THE NEWS EVERYONE HAS BEEN DREADING. [ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS ] Peck: A ROUTINE PATROL DOWN RACCA ROAD TURNS UP A GRUESOME DISCOVERY EARLY THURSDAY MORNING BY JENNINGS POLICE. Officer: WE GOT APPROXIMATELY A MILE DOWN THE ROAD AND DISCOVERED THE BODY OF A BLACK FEMALE WHO HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED LAYING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. Peck: AUTHORITIES SAY THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE SHE WAS MURDERED ELSEWHERE AND DUMPED HERE, WHERE SHE WAS FOUND PARTIALLY NUDE AROUND 3:00 A.M. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, OFFICIALS RELEASE THE NAME OF THE VICTIM. LACONIA BROWN, ALSO KNOWN AS MUGGY, WAS 23 YEARS OLD AND LIVED IN JENNINGS WITH HER GRANDMOTHER AND YOUNG SON. YOU WANT TO GO SEE HER? Bessie: THAT NIGHT, WE WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME, AND WE WAS BARBECUING. SHE LEFT ABOUT 12:30. I SAID, "LACONIA, WHERE YOU GOING?" SHE SAID, "MAMA, I'M GOING TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THE DAW," AND SHE SAID, "I'LL BE BACK." SHE GOT ON HER KNEES. SHE KISSED JAHEIM, AND SHE KISSED ME. SHE SAID, "MAMA, I LOVE YOU," AND SHE SAY, "I WANT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND TAKE CARE OF JAHEIM." SO I SAID, "GIRL, YOU BETTER BE HERE," AND SHE SAID, "YES, MA'AM, MAMA. I'M-A BE HERE MYSELF," AND SHE LEFT, AND SHE NEVER RETURNED BACK HOME. LACONIA BROWN, ALSO KNOWN AS MUGGY... THIS IS THE AREA RIGHT HERE IN WHICH SHE WAS FOUND. FACING DOWN, HEAD THIS WAY TO THE... FACING NORTH. SHE WAS FULLY CLOTHED, NOT QUITE AS DECOMPOSED AS THE OTHER ONES WERE, BUT THERE WAS SOME DECOMPOSITION ON HER. Bessie: THEY FIND THE BODY ON RACCA ROAD, AND WHEN I WENT THERE TO GO SEE, THE POLICEMAN TOLD ME, "NO, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE." THEY HAD BEAT HER SO BAD, THEY WOULDN'T LET THE FAMILY LOOK AT THE BODY, BUT I STILL WANTED TO SEE. Narrator: AUTOPSY RESULTS REVEAL COCAINE AND ALCOHOL IN HER SYSTEM, AND SIMILAR TO ERNESTINE PATTERSON, LACONIA'S THROAT WAS SLIT. INCISED WOUNDS TO THE NECK WERE PART OF THE CAUSE OF DEATH. Narrator: SEVEN CUTS TO HER NECK AND THREE CUTS BEHIND HER RIGHT EAR. POLICE WONDER IF THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE A PATTERN. Cormier: ONCE AGAIN, YOU HAD A FEMALE FOUND ON A ROADWAY. THE VICTIMS WERE IN WATER, AND NOW, THEY'RE ON A ROADWAY, SO DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING? OR IS THAT JUST WHAT THE PERSON... THEY'RE TRYING TO BE A COPYCAT-TYPE SITUATION, OR IS THAT JUST WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH, YOU KNOW? BOTH OF THE BLACK FEMALE VICTIMS HAD INCISED-TYPE WOUNDS, AND SO DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING, YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH YOUR INVESTIGATION. THE DISCOVERY OF THE LATEST BODY COMES AS DISTURBING NEWS TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE OTHER MURDERED WOMEN. THEY SAY THERE'S NO DOUBT IN THEIR MINDS THAT THE MURDERS ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED. IT'S QUITE DISTURBING FOR A SMALL TOWN LIKE THIS TO HAVE THAT MANY YOUNG WOMEN MURDERED. THERE'S NO OTHER WORD BUT MURDERED, AND JUST DUMPED LIKE THEY'RE NOBODIES. Narrator: TO HER FAMILY, LACONIA WAS MORE THAN JUST THE FIFTH VICTIM. SHE WAS A GRANDDAUGHTER, MOTHER, AND SISTER. Kindra: MUGGY, SHE WAS LOVING. SHE WOULD BE THERE TO COMB MY HAIR. SHE WOULD BE THERE TO RUN OUR BATHWATER. SHE WOULD BE THERE TO TIE OUR SHOE. IF WE GET WHOOPED, SHE WOULD BE THERE. "OH, COME ON, MY SISTER. YOUR SISTER LOVE YOU. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY." SHE ALWAYS WANTED US TO BE HAPPY, KEEP GOING, NEVER GIVE UP. Bessie: I REALLY MISS LACONIA A WHOLE LOTS. I PRAY TO GOD, WHOEVER DONE IT THAT THEY WOULD TELL US WHY. Kindra: I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP ON MY SISTER. I'M-A FIGHT 'TIL I CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE. I STILL LOVE HER, AND I'M STILL GONNA PUSH THIS UNTIL THE END, UNTIL WE REALLY FIND OUT WHO REALLY DID THIS TO HER. THAT'S SOMEBODY'S CHILD. YOU'D NEVER TAKE NOBODY LIFE, NEVER. Narrator: AS LACONIA'S FAMILY GRIEVES, ANOTHER LOCAL WOMAN SHARES AN OMINOUS PREMONITION WITH HER MOTHER. SHE'S LIKE, "WELL, WHAT IF I'M NEXT? WHAT IF I AM THE NEXT ONE MURDERED?" AND SHE WAS. Narrator: MAY 2008, THE BODIES OF FIVE WOMEN HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED OVER THREE YEARS NEAR THE SMALL LOUISIANA TOWN OF JENNINGS. Reporter: LACONIA BROWN IS THE FIFTH WOMAN TO BE FOUND DEAD IN THE RURAL AREA OF JENNINGS. POLICE CHIEF JOHNNY LASSITER SAYS THEY HAVEN'T DETERMINED THE MOTIVE OR A SUSPECT AT THIS TIME. Lassiter: WE'RE FOLLOWING UP WITH SEVERAL LEADS. WE'RE KIND OF NARROWING DOWN THE FIELD, AND HOPEFULLY, WE'LL SOON BE ABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO ONE PERSON. Narrator: JUST FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE TERRIBLE DISCOVERY OF LACONIA BROWN, THE SMALL-TOWN POLICE FORCE IS STRUGGLING TO INVESTIGATE THE FIVE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS WHEN ANOTHER HARROWING CALL COMES IN. Edwards: I WAS COMING BACK FROM LAKE CHARLES. WE HAD HURRICANE IKE ON THE WAY WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT AND HEADED THIS WAY. THERE WAS A LOT OF DECOMPOSITION, WHICH MADE IT HARDER TO IDENTIFY. HUNTERS WHO WERE COMING OUT HERE TO DO SOME HUNTING SMELLED SOMETHING REALLY BAD AND REPORTED IT TO US. I CAN SHOW YOU DOWN IN THIS RAVINE, RIGHT IN HERE. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] Cormier: THE BODY WAS FOUND IN A WOODED AREA. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THIS IS TOTALLY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, OR IS THIS SAME PERSON, PERSONS JUST CHANGING THINGS UP OR JUST A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, AND THAT'S HOW THEY ENDED UP HAPPENING? Narrator: OFFICIALS SET UP A COMMAND POST TO PROCESS THE CRIME SCENE. Cormier: THAT WAS THE WORST CASE OF DECOMPOSITION OF ALL THE VICTIMS. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DECOMPOSITION, AND THE MORE TIME AND THE MORE A BODY IS EXPOSED TO ELEMENTS, MORE AND MORE CHANGES OCCUR. BASICALLY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BODY THAT WAS A SKELETAL-TYPE REMAINS. Narrator: MEANWHILE, SARAH AND BRIAN BENOIT'S DAUGHTER HAS BEEN MISSING NEARLY TWO WEEKS, BUT THAT WASN'T UNUSUAL FOR 24-YEAR-OLD CRYSTAL. WHEN WE MOVED TO JENNINGS, SHE STARTED GETTING IN WITH THE CROWDS THAT WERE DOING THE DRUGS, EVEN AS AN EIGHTH-GRADER AND FRESHMAN. THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING. THERE WAS A LOT OF PROSTITUTION GOING ON AT THAT TIME ALSO, AND THEN SHE DISAPPEARED WITH THEM, TWO WEEKS, THREE WEEKS AT A TIME. THE LAST PLACE SHE WAS HEARD FROM WAS... SHE WAS AT PHILLIPS 66 AND MADE A PHONE CALL TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. SUPPOSEDLY AT THAT TIME, SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY WHO WAS DOING IT AND REALLY COULDN'T SAY THE NAME, BUT SHE WAS SCARED. AND THIS IS HER AND I IN A BEDROOM OF THE GRANDMA'S HOUSE WHEN SHE WAS A BABY, AND THIS WAS FROM HER 5th BIRTHDAY. SHE LOVED BARBIES, AND THIS IS HER FOR HER FIRST COMMUNION. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR AT THE AGE OF 12, AND, YOU KNOW, SHE ALWAYS LOVED EVERYONE ELSE BUT HERSELF, AND SHE HAD BEEN RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME AND BEEN HANGING AROUND THE SAME CROWD THAT PRETTY MUCH PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS, AND SHE WOULD START DOING THE DRUGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. CRYSTAL HAD A VERY SECURE LIFE, YOU KNOW? SHE WAS ALWAYS WELCOME TO BE HERE WITH US AS A FAMILY. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE OUT THERE. SHE COULD'VE BEEN HERE, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE DRUGS JUST PULLS YOU AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY, AND IT CONSUMES EVERYTHING. WE KNOW SHE KNEW KRISTEN, AND WE KNOW SHE KNEW LORETTA, YOU KNOW, AND SHE SAID SHE KNEW ERNESTINE. SHE KNEW MUGGY. SHE'S LIKE, "WELL, WHAT IF I'M NEXT?" "WHAT IF I AM THE NEXT ONE MURDERED?" Narrator: A WEEK AFTER THE HEARTBREAKING DISCOVERY, DENTAL RECORDS FAIL TO IDENTIFY THE BODY. SARAH AND BRIAN BENOIT HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT EXPECT THE WORST. Sarah: IN MY HEART, I KNEW, YES, BUT I STILL WANTED THE CONFIRMATION. BASICALLY, I SAT ON THIS CHAIR AND WAITING FOR A RED TRUCK, WHICH IS THE CORONER'S TRUCK, TO TELL ME WHAT THE DNA RESULTS WERE, AND I'D JUST SIT HERE DAY IN, DAY OUT, AND I COULDN'T FUNCTION. I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE. I'D JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT. Narrator: AS THE BENOITS WAIT TO HEAR IF THE UNIDENTIFIED BODY IS THEIR DAUGHTER'S, FRUSTRATION WITH THE POLICE INVESTIGATION MOTIVATES SEVERAL OF THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES TO HIRE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. Menard: THE FAMILIES FELT THAT AFTER THREE YEARS, THE INVESTIGATION WAS GOING SLOW. THEY FELT LAW ENFORCEMENT LACKED THE MANPOWER. THEY KNEW THAT I HAD 30 INVESTIGATORS UNDER MY LICENSE AS THIS IS ALL WE DO AND FORMALLY RETAINED ME. TWO DAYS LATER, BRITTNEY GARY ENDS UP MISSING. Narrator: ON NOVEMBER 2, 2008, TWO MONTHS AFTER THE UNIDENTIFIED BODY IS FOUND, 17-YEAR-OLD BRITTNEY GARY DISAPPEARS. BRITTNEY, A COUSIN OF THE THIRD VICTIM, KRISTEN LOPEZ, IS LAST SEEN IN A JENNINGS DOLLAR STORE. Reporter: A MISSING CHILD IS ANY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE, AND TERESA GARY IS LIVING IT. HER 17-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, BRITTNEY GARY, WENT MISSING. SO FAR, CLUES ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE HAVE TURNED UP NOTHING. Jones: WE KNEW IMMEDIATELY BRITTNEY GARY WAS MISSING BECAUSE SHE WAS A MINOR, SO THAT HIT THE NEWS INSTANTLY. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH... IF THEY DON'T FIND HER SOON, THEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED. Narrator: KIRK MENARD AND HIS ASSOCIATES JOIN THE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING TEEN. LET'S GET THIS UNDER CONTROL, PREVENT A KILLING. THEN LET'S LOOK FOR WHO'S DONE THIS. Reporter: PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR KIRK MENARD SAYS AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, HE AND HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE TO ASSUME THE WORST. I WENT OUT WITH MENARD AND HIS TEAM THURSDAY EVENING AS THEY SEARCHED FOR BRITTNEY IN THE RURAL AREAS WHERE THE OTHER WOMEN HAVE BEEN FOUND DEAD. WE WANT CLOSURE. THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES WANT CLOSURE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. Reporter: AS FAR AS TERESA GARY, SHE SAYS SHE WON'T STOP UNTIL HER DAUGHTER IS FOUND. I KNOW THAT MY CHILD IS ALIVE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. I KNOW THIS, AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP HOPE. I KNOW SHE IS. Narrator: TWO FAMILIES WAIT. TWO FAMILIES HOPE THAT THEIR DAUGHTER IS NOT THE NEXT VICTIM. [ WHISTLE BLOWS, INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] [ MARCHING BAND PLAYS ] [ WHISTLE BLOWING ] WE WERE AT A FOOTBALL GAME ON MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY... [ MARCHING BAND CONTINUES, WHISTLING CONTINUES ] ...AND WE'D SEEN THE CORONER WALKING UP, AND HE'S GOT TO CROSS ALL THESE PEOPLE TO GET TO US, AND EVERYBODY ELSE STARING AT HIM, FOR HIM TO COME TO TELL US THAT IT'S OUR DAUGHTER. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING, WHISTLE BLOWS ] MY KIDS WAS THERE WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL BAND, AND WE HAD TO LEAVE, AND I HAD TO LEAVE MY KIDS THERE. COULD'VE WAITED 'TIL WE GOT HOME, YOU KNOW? Narrator: THE DNA RESULTS CONFIRM THE BENOITS' WORST FEARS. THE BODY FOUND BY THE HUNTERS IS THEIR DAUGHTER'S... CRYSTAL BENOIT ZENO. BUT THE STATE OF HER BODY MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CORONER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF DEATH. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] Cormier: ONCE YOU HAVE DECOMP OR, YOU KNOW, ANY KIND OF ANIMAL ACTIVITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU NOW HAVE INTRODUCED OTHER THINGS INTO THE MEDICAL STANDPOINT. WAS THIS CAUSED BY A PERSON, OR WAS THIS BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER, THE DECOMP, OR SOME ANIMAL ACTIVITY? Reporter: HOW MUCH HEARTACHE CAN ONE COMMUNITY STAND? LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER MUGGY'S DEATH, ANOTHER FAMILY GOES THROUGH THE SAME DEEP SORROW. WE PUT THE DATE OF HER BURIAL, WHICH IS THE DATE THAT WE FELT THAT SHE WAS LAID TO REST AND AT PEACE. Brian: IT'S BEEN ROUGH, VERY, VERY ROUGH BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO SOMEBODY ELSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU RELIVE IT AGAIN, YOU KNOW? IT'S JUST BEEN HARD, AND... I'M ANGRY, YOU KNOW? AND I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGRY, BUT I HAVE TO TRY TO HOLD MY PEACE WITH GOD. IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT'S REAL SICK THAT'S DOING THIS, AND I THINK THEY NEED GOD IN THEIR LIFE. Narrator: AS THE SIXTH VICTIM IS LAID TO REST, 17-YEAR-OLD BRITTNEY GARY'S FAMILY CONTINUES THEIR DESPERATE SEARCH. SIX WOMEN HAVE BEEN FOUND DEAD NEAR JENNINGS, AND TONIGHT, THE SEARCH CONTINUES FOR A MISSING TEENAGER. Reporter: BRITTNEY GARY HAS BEEN MISSING FOR MORE THAN 10 DAYS NOW. SHE WAS LAST SEEN BUYING MINUTES FOR HER CELLPHONE AT THE JENNINGS FAMILY DOLLAR STORE. BRITTNEY WAS RELATED TO ONE OF THE WOMEN FOUND DEAD IN JEFF DAVIS PARISH AND WAS FRIENDS WITH OTHER VICTIMS. Teresa: I MADE A PROMISE THAT I WOULD FIND HER, AND I WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL I DID, AND I'M NOT GONNA STOP. MY DAUGHTER WILL NOT BE NUMBER SEVEN. I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN. [ CRYING ] Narrator: IT'S NOVEMBER 2008. SIX WOMEN HAVE BEEN FOUND DEAD, DUMPED ON THE RURAL ROADS AND IN THE CANALS AROUND JENNINGS, LOUISIANA. ALL OF THE DEATHS ARE SUSPICIOUS... ...AND MANY IN THIS SMALL SOUTHERN TOWN FEAR THAT THE DEATHS ARE CONNECTED. THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. WE EITHER HAVE A SERIAL DUMPER. WE COULD HAVE A SERIAL KILLER, BUT AT THIS POINT, WE ONLY HAVE THREE OF OUR SIX VICTIMS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A HOMICIDE. Reporter: WHAT WOULD BE A SERIAL DUMPER? COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT? WELL, I REALLY DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE TERMINOLOGY. I GUESS WE'RE MAKING UP. COULD BE THE SAME PERSON THAT IS INVOLVED WITH THEM GETTING OVERDOSED AND JUST DUMPING THEIR BODY SOMEWHERE ELSE. RICKY EDWARDS SAID, "WE MAY HAVE A SERIAL DUMPER," SO THE GIRLS OVERDOSED, AND THEN SOMEBODY IS DUMPING THE BODIES. I THINK THAT'S A... THE STUPIDEST THING THEY COULD EVER SAY. OVERDOSE IS JUST A COP-OUT, IN MY OPINION. I THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT, "OH, WELL, IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF DRUG ADDICTS WHO OVERDOSED." LIKE, YOU KNOW, PICK THIS RUG UP, SWEEP IT UNDER THERE, AND THEN WE'LL CALL IT A DAY. THE CONNOTATION OF BEING DUMPED, OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS JUST... NOBODY HAD USE FOR ANYMORE, JUST THROWN AWAY AND JUST DISCARDED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD... THAT'S HORRIBLE. Narrator: NOW, THE GARY FAMILY PRAYS THEIR DAUGHTER HASN'T SUFFERED THE SAME FATE. Reporter: 17-YEAR-OLD BRITTNEY GARY IS LAST SEEN ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AT A STORE. HER MOTHER, TERESA GARY, PLEADS FOR ANYONE WITH INFORMATION TO COME FORWARD. SO I'M ASKING ANYONE OUT THERE, IF YOU HAVE SEEN BRITTNEY, PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU. PLEASE CALL ME. Lauren: I WAS ABOUT 11 WHEN I MET HER. HER MOM AND MY DADDY WERE FRIENDS, AND THEY DID DRUGS TOGETHER. HER MOTHER AND HER MOVED INTO MY UNCLE BILLY'S CAMPER, AND FROM THERE, IT BECAME, LIKE, A SISTERHOOD. SHE WOULD WEAR MY CLOTHES. SHE WOULD TAKE BATHS. SHE WOULD EAT WITH US. WE WOULD PLAY GAMES, DO ALL THINGS THAT GIRLS DO, GOSSIP, YOU KNOW? SHE WAS LIKE A BIG SISTER. WE COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT ANYTHING, NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS, PROBLEMS, SECRETS, IT DIDN'T MATTER. EVEN MY DRUG PROBLEM. I USED TO SNORT POWDER. WHEN I STOPPED SNORTING POWDER... WHEN ME AND MY HUSBAND GOT A DIVORCE, AND I MOVED TO FLORIDA, I STOPPED SNORTING POWDER, AND THAT'S WHENEVER I TRIED CRACK COCAINE. YEP. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, IT'S BEEN AN ON-AND-OFF THING FOR A GOOD WHILE. Narrator: LIKE HER MOTHER, BRITTNEY ALSO STRUGGLED WITH DRUG ADDICTION. Velvet: THE AVERAGE TEENAGER STARTS SMOKING WEED, WANTS TO DRINK EARLY, WANTS TO SMOKE CIGARETTES, YOU KNOW, AND WANTS TO FIT IN, AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTED. Teresa: WHEN MY DAUGHTER WENT MISSING ON NOVEMBER THE 2nd, I TOLD HER ALL DAY, "NO," SHE COULDN'T WALK TO THE DOLLAR STORE. WHY DID I DECIDE TO LET HER GO? HOW DO YOU NOT LET YOUR DAUGHTER WALK FIVE BLOCKS AND GET HER SOME MINUTES AT THE DOLLAR STORE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN TELLING HER, "NO," ALL DAY, YOU KNOW? YOU'VE BEEN WORKING AND CLEANING THE HOUSE ALL DAY LONG, AND... ...SHE WANTED TO GO GET HER MINUTES FOR HER PHONE, AND SHE WAS DONE, AND THE STORE WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES. SO, WHEN SHE LEFT TO GO TO THAT DOLLAR STORE TO PUT HER MINUTES ON HER PHONE, AND SHE DID NOT ANSWER THAT PHONE WHEN I CALLED HER, SOMETHING WAS WRONG. IT'S A MOTHER'S INSTINCT. SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. Lauren: THE LAST TIME I SAW BRITTNEY, SHE WAS WALKING UP THE ROAD, AND SHE WAS CRYING, AND I ASKED HER WHAT WAS WRONG, WHY WAS SHE CRYING. AND SHE SAID IT WAS A DISPUTE SHE HAD BETWEEN HER AND HER MOM. THEY WAS ARGUING. WHATEVER. SHE JUST WANTED TO GET AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I ASKED IF I COULD GO WALK WITH HER. SHE TOLD ME, "NO." SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE. SO I TOLD HER, "ALL RIGHT." SHE SAID, "I'M GOING TO GET A PHONE CARD. I'M COMING BACK." MY AND MY LITTLE COUSIN ALI WAS SITTING ON THE PORCH AT THIS TIME. SO WE TOLD HER, "ALL RIGHT." BRITTNEY NEVER CAME BACK. Schiering: THIS WEEKEND, IT WILL BE TWO WEEKS SINCE BRITTNEY GARY WENT MISSING. PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY BELIEVE HER DISAPPEARANCE IS LINKED TO THE DEATHS OF SIX WOMEN BECAUSE OF HER PREVIOUS HIGH-RISK LIFESTYLE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MAP. EACH OF THE WOMEN WERE LEFT IN RURAL JEFF DAVIS PARISH. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING, YOU ARE URGED TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ABOUT THE DEAD WOMEN AND THE MISSING TEEN. "3 ON THE STREET" TONIGHT, MEGAN SCHIERING, KATC TV... Teresa: I GOT OUT THERE EVERY DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY, EVENING, NIGHT, ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT. NO ONE FORMED A SEARCH PARTY. I DID THAT. HER SISTER, AUNTS, UNCLES, BROTHERS, SISTER, THE COMMUNITY, AND MY FAMILY. Reporter: PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE FIVE-PARISH AREA TEAMED UP ON HORSEBACK, FOUR-WHEELERS AND ON FOOT, SEARCHING JEFF DAVIS PARISH FOR 17-YEAR-OLD BRITTNEY GARY. WE LOOKED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. I CAN REMEMBER BEING IN THE VEHICLE WITH MY NANNY, MY OTHER COUSIN, AND HER MAMA. WE'D ALL BE THERE LOOKING FOR HER, AND THEN I REMEMBER WHEN THEY GOT THE PHONE CALL. [ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS ] Reporter: IT BEGAN AS A DAY OF HOPE BUT ENDED WITH A GRUESOME DISCOVERY. SATURDAY, A BODY WAS FOUND OFF HIGHWAY 1126 ON KEYSTONE ROAD NEAR ROANOKE. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE IDENTITY THAT, THAT BRITTNEY IS THIS PERSON. Reporter: AUTHORITIES DO REPORT TATTOOS ON THE BODY ARE A MATCH OF THOSE OF BRITTNEY GARY. Narrator: WITH THE NEAR CERTAINTY THAT THE REMAINS DISCOVERED ARE BRITTNEY'S, THE SEARCH IS CALLED OFF. Reporter: HER UNCLE OFFERED A TEARFUL THANKS TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED SEARCH FOR HIS NIECE. I JUST WANT TO LET Y'ALL KNOW HOW MUCH WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE COME OUT AND DONE FOR US, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE WAS LIKE THIS, AND FROM WHAT YOU COULD SEE, THERE WAS BLOOD AROUND HER. HER CLOTHES IS RIPPED UP. YEAH, I SAW IT. I CAN REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. I SAW IT, AND MY NANNY MADE ME GET BACK IN THE VEHICLE BEFORE THEY FLIPPED HER BODY OVER. THEY TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY FLIPPED HER OVER, HER FACE WASN'T THERE NO MORE. IT'S KIND OF TRAUMATIZING 'CAUSE, LIKE, WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LIKE, I SEEN MY FRIEND LAID OUT DEAD. DEAD. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON. SHE DIDN'T DESERVE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER AT ALL, AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. LIKE, WHY HER? Reporter: JUST 17 YEARS OLD, BRITTNEY IS THE YOUNGEST ON A GROWING LIST OF VICTIMS FOUND DEAD IN JEFF DAVIS PARISH OVER THE PAST 3 1/2 YEARS. AS INVESTIGATORS PRESS FORWARD ON THIS UNSOLVED MYSTERY, ANSWERS HAVE BEEN HARD TO COME BY FOR THIS SMALL TOWN. Velvet: I HAVE THIS... I CALL IT MY BEANIE BOX. AND THIS... I DON'T HAVE ANY OF HER BELONGINGS, BUT I HAVE STUFF FROM HER FUNERAL LIKE A ROSE, ANGEL WINGS. THIS IS ONE OF THE DOVES, A ROSE, CANDLES. SHE HAD A CLOSED CASKET, SO THIS WAS THE INSIDE OF IT. I TOOK A PICTURE OF THAT, HER AND HER 1st BIRTHDAY PARTY. THIS IS ALL WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, IS MEMORIES AND PICTURES. OUR LIVES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. I WAS... 17 YEARS OF MY LIFE, IT WAS SPENT RIGHT NEXT TO HER, YOU KNOW? AND SHE'S GONE. I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER FRIEND LIKE THAT, NEVER. SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. NO ONE CAN REPLACE HER, TAKE HER PLACE. NOTHING IN THIS WORLD CAN MEAN TO ME WHAT SHE MEANT TO ME. Narrator: WITH BRITTNEY'S DEATH, THE COMMUNITY'S GROWING FRUSTRATION AT THE POLICE'S LACK OF PROGRESS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS BOILS OVER TO OUTRAGE. Woman: THAT'S RIGHT. I WANT JUSTICE, AND I'M GONNA GET IT. I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES ME 'TIL I DRAW MY LAST BREATH. I'M GONNA GET IT [CHUCKLES] BECAUSE I WAS CHEATED, AND SO WAS SHE. Man: CHRIST, JESUS, YOU WILL WATCH OVER HER UNTIL THE END OF TIME. WE SAY, "ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST." RETURN YE NOW BACK TO THE LORD... Narrator: NEXT TIME, IN THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF "DEATH IN THE BAYOU," THE BODY COUNT CONTINUES TO RISE. Caiman: IT JUST SEEMED LIKE EVERY TIME YOU TURNED AROUND, IT WAS, LIKE, ANOTHER GIRL, ANOTHER GIRL. Reporter: ANOTHER WOMAN REPORTED MISSING IN JEFF DAVIS PARISH. Narrator: AS POLICE SCRAMBLE TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER... YOU HAVE ALL ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A SERIAL KILLER. Kindra: Y'ALL NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS BEFORE SOMETHING HAPPEN AGAIN. Man: THIS IS THE SOUTH SIDE OF THEM TRACKS. YOU COME ACROSS THIS SIDE, THEY DON'T WANT TO DO A [BLEEP] DAMN THING. Narrator: MEANWHILE, FAMILY MEMBERS CONTINUE THEIR HUNT FOR THE TRUTH. Woman: THERE WAS SOME ARGUMENT IN THE TRUCK AS TO, WAS IT A DEER, OR WAS IT A BODY? ANYBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEAD DEER AND A DEAD BODY. BUT IN A TOWN FULL OF SECRETS, CAN ANYONE BE TRUSTED? Man #2: EVERYBODY POINTS THE FINGER AT EVERYBODY, AND YOU JUST END UP NOT KNOWING WHO TO BELIEVE. SHE SAID, "IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME, IT'S THE POLICE." THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO PIN IT ON ANYBODY THEY COULD. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS PROTECTING FRANKIE, BUT HE'S DOING SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR SOMEONE. SOMEBODY IS HIDING A MONSTER HERE.
