Come on… Close the oven! What was it supposed to be? That was supposed to be sweet potato casserole. Don't worry. I like them better out of the can anyway. Put them in the bag. I'm ready. Oh… What are you wearing, buddy? Trucks. Trucks… ♫ All right, guys. ♫ Are you okay? Yeah, why? I know today's hard for you. Grandpa said holidays are especially difficult for people coping with long-term grief. That's why you're so sad. Well, what does your Grandpa know? He is a psychiatrist. Not mine. Do you think Mom's with us? Like an angel? Hey. I know she is. I know she's watching over you and Jackson all the time. And you too. And me too. Hey, you should take this inside for me, okay? You got it? ♫ Kate… Why's it got to be so hard? Okay… Hey, Grandma! Hey, Grandpa! Hey, Jackson! Hey, buddy. Can I watch T.V.? Yup, go on. Hey, Sophie! Hey, Sophie. Hi. Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, hi, sweetheart. I think I got everything on your list. Great. We're almost ready for dinner. Just in time to carve the turkey. Oh, all right. Hey, Chris, can you grab another chair for the table? I think we're gonna need it. Yeah. You got it. Ladies and gentleman, If you will please rise for our National Anthem. Here to honour America is international recording artist, Nikki. ♪ Oh, say can you see… ♪ Did I miss the kick-off? Hey. How about a hello? Sorry, Mom, I was just getting to that part. Dad.

Chris, your daughter thinks you're too old… to know who Nikki is. Well, she's right. We didn't have music in the dark ages. Sophie wishes she was Nikki. I do not! But, she is my favorite singer. Everyone loves her. That's more true than you know. ♪ …and the home ♪ ♪ of the brave ♪ Right, Chris? I should go help Shelley get the table ready. Why is that a big deal? It's not. What's a big deal? Nikki. The pop singer? Oh, yes, well… she was… Dinner is ready! Let's eat! But the game's about to start. Nothing ever happens 'til the fourth quarter. Let's go. Um, I just wanna… wash my hands. Okay, sweetie, make it quick. And mute the T.V. I don't want to hear grunting during dinner. Nikki, you have a new Christmas album coming out. Can you tell us about it? Well, it's a mix of some traditional favorites and a few new originals. So, we can expect to see a lot of you this holiday season? I have a few T.V. appearances scheduled, and a live concert on Christmas Eve. You also have a CD release party on Tuesday. Yeah, I'm doing a meet and greet at Sleep Jive Records in Manhattan, so anyone in the area should come out. You're definitely treating the folks in the tri-state area this year. Well, I'm from there so it's good to be home for the holidays. Thanks a lot, Nikki. Yeah, thank you. Her new album Mistletoe Over Manhattan drops on Tuesday. Believe me, you're gonna wanna add it to your holiday collection. Kick-off is next after a word from our sponsors. I hope everyone has room for dessert. I know I can make space for some homemade pumpkin pie. And by the way, mom, I love your Thanksgiving decorations. I love the holidays, so sue me. Your mother uses Thanksgiving to make plans for Christmas. Now, be nice. I give thanks. And notice, I haven't put the tree up yet. But, now that we're talking about it, what are the plans for Christmas? Oh, um… Nikki's having her concert on Christmas eve. Maybe we can go to that? Uh, no, you need to be asleep so Santa can drop off your presents, sweetheart. Okay, what's the big secret about Nikki? Nothing. Then why does everyone get all weird when her name is mentioned? Nobody gets weird. Dad and Uncle Jason are. Okay, I'll tell ya. Nikki used to go to high school with us. Wow, you and dad know her? She's from around here? Wow, this is so cool! Well, we were all kinda close back then, but especially your dad. They were like high school sweethearts. Baseball All-star, head cheerleader, crazy in love. No way! Dad dated a celebrity? Wait, not exactly. She wasn't famous back then. What happened? Uh… graduation. End of story. Not exactly. She wanted your dad to move to Los Angeles, but… But, it didn't work out. Why not? It's… complicated, sweetheart. In my personal opinion, he didn't want to live in her shadow. That is absolutely not true. So, you conveniently broke up right when your baseball career was ending and her singing career was taking off? We grew apart. Okay? It just wasn't meant to be. You know, when I think about it, it was kinda like your last twenty relationships. Do not judge me because I am selective. Is that what we're calling it now? When was the last time you spoke to her? That was before you were born, sweetheart. You know, I think that's enough reminiscing for now, huh? Did mom know about this? Mmhmm. Your mom had her first love, too. Just the mere mention of Damian Matthews made her giddy. You know, both your parents had their own heartbreaks before they fell in love with each other. That's how life works. Full of lessons. It's what makes the heart grow stronger. And on that note, why don't we clear the table. Do you think Nikki remembers dad? I don't see how she could forget. I mean, they were each other's first loves, and… this part, it's a secret, so… I think your dad still carries a torch for her. How does he do that? Oh, buddy. One day you'll find out. Believe me. ♫ All right… Ready? And dunk. Mmmmm. Mmm. Mmmm. That is so good. These may be the best ever. I think you're right. That's Nikki. She has a new Christmas album. Well, that kitchen's not going to clean itself. ♪ Find the boxes in the attic. ♪ ♪ … Christmas cheer ♪ ♪ Hang each treasure ♪ ♪ on the tree, ♪ ♪ the night is ♪ ♪ almost here ♪ Uncle Jason said that she was your first love. Who? Nikki. We went to high school together. Uncle Jason said you still love her. Well, your Uncle Jason is a man-child who knows nothing about love. So, you loved her. I did. You know, everyone has their first love. She was mine. Did she love you? I… I'd like to think so. See, falling in love, it's… it's confusing and exciting all at the same time. One day, in the very distant future, you'll fall in love too. You'll see. I think love's the best thing that can happen to a person. Well, it is. And I was lucky enough to find it twice. How young were you? Like, when does love start? Well, it's different for everyone. For me, I was fifteen. A group of us went to the movies, so I decided to do something crazy to show her how I felt. What?? Well, it took all my courage, but half way into the movie, I reached over and I held her hand. And what happened? She didn't let go. I don't even remember the rest of the movie. I just, I held her hand and I smiled. Holding a boy's hand in a movie? I'd rather eat popcorn. Good. ♪ Jingle ♪ ♪ bells, jingle bells. ♪ ♪ Laughing all the way in a ♪ ♪ one-horse open sleigh ♪ Did Nikki have such a beautiful voice back then? Everything about Nikki was beautiful. ♫ Am I late for school?! No. What do you want? I have a plan. What are you talking about? Operation date for dad. Who wants to date dad? Nikki. You're crazy. I'm serious. Dad said they loved each other once. Maybe they can again. Nikki's like the biggest star in the world. How are we even going to meet her? She's having a CD signing in Manhattan. We can meet her there. Dad would never go. Dad won't, but we are. I did some research and found the easiest way to Manhattan. It's in another state. Really, Jackson? It's just over the bridge. But, there's just one thing. What? I only have twenty dollars. Could you break your piggy bank? No! I'm saving for a new skateboard. You know Santa can bring you that. Think about dad. It's been five years since mom died, and he needs to find love again, 'cause he's not getting any younger. We'll stop by the mall and you can see Santa. Ask him for the skateboard. Deal. But I don't want to lie to dad. There will be no lying. Look… After dad drops us off at school, we'll walk over to this bus stop. We'll take the bus down, and we see Nikki by noon, then we take the bus back. What's the money for? We need to buy a CD, and just in case we need to catch a cab. By my calculations, we should be back by three. Dad will never know. Good plan. Let's get dad a girlfriend. ♫ I don't think your calculations included all these people. Whoa, little miss, where you going? Ha. To see Nikki. And so are all these people. I'm sorry, you're going to have to go to the end of the line. No, sweetie, the end of the line. I'm guessing we're not going to have time to see Santa today. ♫ What if we don't meet her? We will. How do you know? It's already two o'clock and we have an hour to see her and get back home. Because it's meant to be. What? Nikki broke up with her boyfriend just in time to date dad. That's destiny at work. You're right. Come on, let's go chase destiny. Our mother's inside, we just came out to pay the meter. Our mother's going to freak out if we don't hurry back inside. Hi. Thank you. Merry Christmas. There you go. Thank you so much. There she is. Wow. She is really pretty. Merry Christmas. Do you know what you're going to say? No idea. Better think of something, we're next. Hey, what are your names? Maybe they don't speak English. Bonjourno, little people. Est ce que tu have a name? Stop it. You want me to sign your CD's? Want me to take a picture of this incredibly awkward moment? I don't have a camera. Ugh. That happened to me too when I met Babs. Don't worry you'll cry, but life goes on. Don't listen to him. Here you go, here are your CD's. Merry Christmas, thanks for coming out. So, we've got… I think we've got to move this to tomorrow. My name is Sophie Marshall! My dad is Chris Marshall! He was your high school sweetheart, and I think he still carries a porch for you! Or, torch. I don't know what that means! Bet you weren't expecting that. Um… I know Chris. I remember. Tell him I said hi. And Merry Christmas. Oh… who is Chris Marshall? Go get them. Why? Just go. On it. I'm so stupid. She thinks I'm crazy. It's okay, don't cry. I just wanted dad to have someone to love this Christmas. I hate that he's so alone. Hmph! There you are. Let's go! No, no, no! Stay! Stay, stay, stay! Sophie Marshall! Sophie, please stop, please! Ow! Kids, listen very closely. These are skinny jeans. They are not meant for sprinting. We're sorry. We didn't mean to hurt anybody. Please. The only thing hurt is my fragile ego. Clearly these spinning classes are not helping my stamina. Okay, come on. Someone wants to have a chat with you. Nikki will be out in a moment. Help yourselves, this isn't Oliver Twist. Hello again. Please, keep eating. That won't be a problem. Um, Carmine, why don't you go get us all some fresh hot chocolate? Sorry about him. He's a little sarcastic sometimes, but he means well. Sophie, right? And…? Jackson. Wow. You look so much like your dad, it's weird. Does he know you guys are here? Not exactly. What about your mom? She died five years ago. I'm so sorry. I lost my mom when I was young too. You said you wanted to talk to us. I wanted to make sure you guys had a safe way to get home. We're taking the bus home. Mmhmm. No. Let me have my driver take you guys. It's better. Thank you so much for coming and seeing me. Please tell your dad I said hello? Bye. You're my favorite singer. Awe, thank you. I really appreciate that. You have such a beautiful voice. My dad said everything about you is beautiful. Really? When did he say that? Saturday. Yeah, hi. I'm calling to check and see if two of your students missed the bus? Sophie and Jackson Marshall. Marshall. I'm sorry, but that's impossible. Okay… Guys! Hey… Hey, are you guys okay? Come here… Look, you two have some explaining to do, okay? Where were you? Dad, before you freak out… It was my fault. I made Jackson skip school and go to Manhattan. You what? Why would you go to Manhattan? Huh? To see me. Hi. Hey, Nikki. I gave them a ride home. It's my fault they're late, I'm sorry. No, I mean, it's just a surprise. We were never in danger. I can explain. Just, Sophie, stop. All right, you two are both grounded for life. What?? That's fair, dad. We'll just go clean our rooms. Thanks for the ride, Nikki, and the CD. Yeah, it was so awesome meeting you. You guys are welcome and it was good meeting you too. So! I can't believe it's been so long since I've seen you. How are you? Oh, I'm good. So, you have a nice house. Oh, yeah, thanks. You know I… I try. 'Cause you know… It's comfortable. It, uh, keeps the rain out, you know, like they say. Hey, oh, are you… Do you want a cookie? 'Cause I mean, I have cookies. I mean, we have milk too. You could dunk it, or… No thanks. No… that was stupid. So, the kids tell me that you're a teacher and a coach. Yeah. Yeah for Lane High School. That's great, they're lucky to have you. You were always good in school. Yeah, so much so, I'm still there. So, I mean, you're a singer. I mean, they pay you. They do. I heard you won a Golden Globe. Yeah, well, a Grammy, yeah… I had a couple of lucky years. So, do you… Do you have like a trophy case you put those in, or… No, I just put them on a shelf. Oh. Oh, if you're looking, I got a great deal at Ikea for one. Not for me, for the school, of course. But I put it together. Good tip. Yeah. So, um, I should go. Oh, right, okay. Okay. Um… maybe you should be easy on the kids. Life is a long time to be grounded for. Yeah, well, I think in this case the punishment fits the crime. It was really good to see you again, Chris. You too. It's really great to see you. After all these years, you're still exactly the same. Bye. Okay. Bye. Bye. Ikea? Dad, she's your first love and all you can talk about is a trophy case. You don't understand the levels of anxiety, okay? I did a better job! What did you say to her? That you think everything about her is beautiful. Wow. I mean that, that's good. I set you up. You still have a chance. All right. Come on, do better than Ikea! Hey-hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait! Please! Please… Sorry! Hey… Hey… I, I'm sorry. I wasn't myself back there. I kind of suspected at milk and cookies. Oh, God… Um, look, you just… You really caught me off guard. Can we just start over again? All right. Um, would you like to get coffee with me, or maybe even dinner? Um, it's kind of tough right now. Yeah. I get it. No, no, it's just that I have rehearsals for my Christmas Eve concert. Right. But I could do tomorrow if you can. You want to have dinner? Really? Are you free? Yeah. No. Uh… I've got, I've got a basketball game. Well, I could come to the game and we can grab a bite afterwards. You wanna come watch my game? Yeah, why not? We're awful. I mean, no one comes to our games. Well, then it sounds like you could use some support. And we could use the time to catch up. It'd be nice. Okay. Um, I'll call you with the details then. I left my number on Sophie's CD. Cool. I can't wait. Me, too. Bye. Bye. What? I'm just so excited to meet this guy. I haven't seen you this rattled since the Grammy's. Oh, I'm not rattled. Maybe a little. Well, just be sure to tell him why we're late. Well, first of all there's no 'we' in this. And second of all, I'm sure he'll understand that I had radio interviews that just went long. And we had to try on everything in your closet. Well, I needed something that blended in. Haha! Girl, fit in? We are in the suburbs. People here wear mom jeans and sneakers. You're wearing designer Italian pumps. Which I very much like… Whatever. This place looks smaller than I remember. It's not. Your world just got bigger. Tough one, guys. You played hard. I'm proud of you. All right? Just let it go. Okay, boys? What the… Oh… And you've been noticed. Was that your high school sweetheart? No. That's not him. Chris! Look, I'm sorry, man. I was distracted. I don't care! You won't believe who's here! I mean, it has to be her. If not, it's the best look-a-like I've ever seen. Who? Nikki. I realize you may no know who that is, but let me assure you, she's a big deal! Would it be weird if I asked her out? Uh, yeah. 'Cause she's here to see me. You? Don't lie. I'm not lying. We were friends in high school. Like, just friends, or good friends? Good friends. Good friends you make out with? Maybe more? No comment. There he is. You are one smitten kitten. Honey, I totally understand the school girl crush. Why'd you guys break up? Oh, he left me. Hey. Hi. How are you? It's good to see you. You made it. Uh, yeah. I was worried that you might… That I'd flake? Never. I'm sorry I was running late. I must have missed the game. No, it's probably good that you did. Hi. Oh, this is Carmine, my assistant. I just had to deal with some work in the car on the way. That's good. Nice to meet you. Au chante. Um, so you still want to grab some dinner? That is so sweet. I can't though, I have some plans tonight with… You were talking to Nikki. Yeah. Yeah, I was. I would love dinner. Great. I was thinking Bodies. Seriously? That place is still open? Of course. Best cheeseburgers in town. Oh, I know. My truck's over here. Burger with a side of charm. Who could resist? Tell me everything tomorrow. Sorry. Is he for real? ♫ This place brings back so many memories. Yeah. We had some good times here, huh. Remember when you and Jason had that contest to see who could eat the most burgers? No, no-no the challenge was to see who could eat a full bad boy burger and fries. Oh, right! The bad boy burger. It was just a big slab of meat between the bun. All to get your name on a wall. Hey, it was a big honor. Oh, yeah? Where's the wall now, huh? Enh… I noticed you didn't get one tonight. Yeah, well, come on, now I gotta worry about high cholesterol and diabetes. When I was sixteen those were just answers on a health quiz. Yeah. So, this isn't a popular hangout anymore? Well, that's probably a good thing anyway, right? Rumor is you're kind of a big deal around here. I don't know, people think you have this perfect life, but it's definitely not true. Looks pretty good to me. Okay, come on, give me an example. Paparazzi, for instance. I mean, they're everywhere these days, and heaven forbid if you eat a big lunch suddenly you're pregnant. If you're not pregnant, you're fat. No matter what the pictures are everywhere and on the internet, they're there forever. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, that would suck. I mean, don't get me wrong, the fans are amazing. I mean, when you have a song that can really touch somebody, it's kind of cool. I'm proud of you, Nikki. No, I mean it. You did what you set out to do. Not a lot of people can say that. Well, uh… I'd say you've been recognized, though. I guess we should probably go. Excuse us. So, where are the kids tonight? Oh, they're with their grandparents. They usually watch them on game nights. I was sorry to hear about Kate. I met her a few times back in high school. She seemed like a sweet girl. Yeah, she was. She grew into an incredible woman too. I bet she did. If you don't mind me asking, how did she die? Um… it was a car accident. It was the night before Thanksgiving, and Kate as always went out to get some last minute stuff. And on her way home she hit some black ice… That was it. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I think the hardest part was telling the kids. They were… they were just toddlers. It's gotta take a lot of strength to come through something like that. The kids, they forced me up. You know, I think the holidays are still the hardest. Kate, she just… She knew how to make them really special. I'm glad you found a great life, Chris. So, what about you? I mean, you've got quite a list of famous beaus. No. No, I don't. Uh, yeah. I googled you. Oh, did you now? And you believe everything you read on the internet? The internet doesn't lie. No, never. It's all true. Uh, the truth is the record label just set most of that stuff up. I mean, I'm friends with them all, but it's hardly romantic. What? Including the Henry Williams? No, Henry and I were actually an item. Well, I mean, I understand the attraction. Not many guys can battle mutant spiders four times, and live to talk about it. Oh, yeah? Yeah, Henry wasn't the best actor, but I don't know, I was looking for a little stability, I guess. But, end of the day, my need for normalcy and his love of publicity didn't really mesh. Thanks. So, thanks for bringing me around back? Yeah, it's fancy. Back doors and kitchens. Oh, the glamorous life. So, uh, thanks for tonight. Yeah. You have a good night. Okay. Um… I have to know something. Why did you leave? What are you talking about? When I got signed, you came out for the celebration, everyone was having a good time, you just disappeared. I'm surprised you even noticed I was gone. Chris, I didn't intentionally ignore you. I thought you supported me. Well, I did. That's why I left. Look, all your dreams were coming true, and I was just in the way. What, so you just vanish? Come on. Look, you barely talked to me while I was there. My baseball career was over. You know, my arm was in a sling, and I just, I realized… You deserve more. You always knew what you wanted. And I was… I was just lost. Things could have been different. I'm sorry. Okay? I really am. I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't regret it, but it worked out. I mean, look at how successful you are. I just want what's best for you, Nik. That's all. Maybe you should trust that I know what's best for me. Goodnight. Wait, let me get that for you… Thanks. No problem. ♫ I wish we could just hold on to this moment. I missed you so much. I would invite you up, but… No. It's too soon. I know. ♫ Saturday, dinner. My treat. I won't take no for an answer. Then I won't say no. Okay. Goodnight. Night. ♫ Morning, Soph. Morning. Anything interesting? Actually, yes. Your favorite singer appears to have a new boyfriend. A mystery man. Ahhhhhh! You have some explaining to do. What could possibly be so urgent? How come I had to find out from TMZ you and Nikki played kissey face last night? TM-what? I know this is you. I know your car anywhere. Where did they get that picture? You can't even see my face. True, they don't have your identity yet. I stress yet, because these people are good. They brought down Tiger Woods. Oh… How many people do you think have seen this picture? Only… anyone awake in the free world. It's everywhere, Nik. Everyone wants to know who this new guy is. Whatever. Gossip has a shelf life of five minutes. Not when it's this good. Nikki. Oh, look who it is. Good morning. JC, I thought the label wasn't sending anyone today. They do when pictures like this hit the press like wildfire. So, I had a date. It's no big deal. Who is he? And why weren't we even told? He's just a friend from high school. Is he married? Got kids? Occupation? Criminal record? Widow, yes, teacher and not that I know of. A widower. Well, you know what? That could work for us. Don't be morbid. Nikki, you have a carefully crafter image, and we have a Christmas eve concert we're trying to sell out. You need the public on our side. On our side? Yes, on our side. Look, you just broke up with America's golden boy. Your focus has to be on selling the album. Christmas is just a few days away, so we've got a small, small window to do it in. But, I'm telling you that this Christmas album, this is the label's last ditch effort to see if you're worth keeping at all. If you want to keep your career, then I suggest you follow directions. No scandals, no new loves, no former flames during the holiday season. What do you want me to do? That's my girl. Look, they're probably going to ask you about this on the Sunrise Brew. The label thinks it's best you downplay the whole thing, say you bumped into some old friend, we'll pay somebody to validate the story later. Ahem. I'm sorry to interrupt the pep talk, but Henry called. He wants to see you. Perfect. Now, that's a relationship that the label can support. The two of you working things out over the holiday season. The public will love that. It's in the best interest of both of your careers. For you to be a couple. Look, I have to talk to Chris. I have to tell him what's going on. No, just stick with the plan. I invited him to dinner on Saturday. Fine. I'll set things up. And you can explain it to him then. It's for the best. I'm sorry, Nikki. Comes with the job. Wow. You really care about him. Who do you think my first album was about? I never thought I'd see him again, and then after last night all these feelings came rushing back and I realized… I'm stupid. Chris deserves someone who's going to be there for him. I can't even stay in one place hardly a week. What are you going to say to him? Forgive me? You know, for what it's worth, I've never seen you as happy as you were last night. I've loved him my whole life. Then don't let him go. Who cares what the label says. They've dictated your life for too long. Yeah. Ready to sing? Yeah. Let's just get through this, okay? I've already spoken with Henry's PR team, you're having dinner with him tonight. So, if they ask you anything about it just say you're working things out. Come on, let's go.

Uh, your voice is absolutely angelic. Oh, thank you so much. Okay, we are gonna talk about your CD… brand new CD in just a moment… but first we need to talk about something that has everybody buzzing. About these news pictures of you. I gotta ask this question, who's this mystery man? And, uh, did he play a role perhaps in this recent breakup with Henry Williams? No. He's actually my high school sweetheart. Oh, I see. Well, it certainly looks like you're perhaps rekindling an old flame? I feel good about where it's going. We'll see. But back to my Christmas album… Of course, of course. So it is called "Mistletoe Over Manhattan". It is available in stores right now. Go out and get yourself a copy. It's a fantastic, fantastic CD. Thank you so much for joining us today, Nikki. Thank you. And I want to wish you happy, happy holidays. Thank you. Happy holidays. Thank you so much. Thank you for joining us as well. We'll see you back here tomorrow. Sorry, JC. I, uh, I want control over my life. You can cancel dinner with Henry. This isn't going to go over well. I don't care. ♫ Dad come on! Hurry up! Dad! Get off my property, I'm calling the police. Go! Dad, you're famous! No, I'm not. Then why are those guys trying to interview us and trying to take pictures of me? Look, I don't want either of you talking to those people. Got it? You stay away from them. The phone keeps ringing. Who's calling? Access Hollywood? E Television, and US Weekly. Everyone else I'm too old to know. That must have been some kiss. Everyone thinks you're Nikki's boyfriend. Are you gonna get married?? That'd be so awesome. Whoa… Guys, sit down. This is ridiculous. I… Guys, I haven't even talked to Nikki since last night. So, just call her. Yeah, dad. Everyone knows the guy should call the girl. Well… it's just a phone call, right? You make them everyday. Okay. ♫ A little privacy, please? But, what if you need coaching? I think I can handle a phone call. ♫ Hello? Hey. Hey, how are you? Ah… Uh… It's been an interesting day… Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make your life crazy. Yeah, yeah, it's the paparazzi. Kinda creepy. They're parked outside my house right now. Um, just don't talk to them and try to keep your distance. I honestly didn't expect all this attention. I hope it didn't change your mind about Saturday. No. No, I'm good. Absolutely. Good. I made reservations at Brialdo's. Do you know it? Yeah, um, it's kind of a famous five-star restaurant, right? Yeah, can you meet me there at seven? I think if we walk in together it'll cause too much commotion. Absolutely, I'm good. I'll be there. Nik! Oh… uh, Carmine just walked in, sorry I have to cut it short. No, you're busy, it's no problem. Look, um, before you go, I just… I just wanted to let you know that I caught your performance today. Really? Yeah. It was absolutely beautiful. Thank you. Um… I'll talk to you later. Yeah. You got it. Okay. Bye. Okay. What?! Someone is drunk with love! Is it that obvious? Uh, look in the mirror, girl? Listen, I wanted to say that I'm really proud of you for standing up for yourself today. Thank you. I think it's the first time I've ever put anything in front of my career. Speaking of your career… JC just called. Uh oh. Okay, so the label is absolutely loving this reunited sweetheart story that you're doing. Really? Uh huh. They leaked pictures of you and Chris from high school. Where did they get my yearbook pictures? Girl… They have more sources than the CIA. The point is is everyone is loving this. Your album is climbing the charts, people are asking for interviews left, right and centre. They're dubbing this: a pop star holiday fairytale. Wow, I really didn't expect all this. And every single network is calling, because they want you to help them ring in the new year. That hasn't happened in a while. Girl, it is happening. Wow. I'm sorry, did someone die? Why aren't you celebrating? Come on, let's do a little happy dance. Sh-sh-shake it. Shake it, shake it, shake it. No, it's just that last time my career took off, Chris left. I just don't want history to repeat itself. Oh, Nikki, come on. That's not going to happen. No, I'm serious. The whole celebrity, publicity thing it just, it complicates matters. I mean, I just want Chris to know that that's not the real me. Right, but you know the best thing about love? What? Well, it's that you can't see it. You can only feel it. So, tell him what's up. No. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Just blurt out I'm madly in love with you and have been my entire life? Yeah. Why not? That's what I would do. 'Cause I'll sound like a crazy person! You know how every year we watch that movie Love Actually, and that really hot guy says that Christmas is a time for truth? Yeah. Well, if you can't tell someone you love them at Christmas, when can you? ♫ Oh, good, you brought clothes. Dad's wardrobe is hideous. Yeah, you got that right. Every suit that he owns is stained and double-breasted. Hey, man. Thanks for bringing some clothes. Apparently, my daughter thinks my wardrobe is embarrassing. Yeah, no, we all do. Really? Am I that bad? Absolutely. Yes. But it's not your fault. You haven't had a real date, since what? Maybe 2002? Thanks. Soph… What do you think? That suit has swag. I… Swag? This girl, this girl knows fashion. Oh… Seriously? Why don't you just go order us a pizza? Huh, Soph? This is it, hm? All right. Hey… What's this? That's Lady Killer. Just dab a little, watch 'em fall. All right… So… how's Nikki? The same. She's beautiful, charming, funny. She's a dream. Yeah, you and Nikki always had a special connection. How many of her songs do you think are about you? I don't know. Are you serious? Well, you can't get over someone if you're always seeing their face, and hearing their voice everywhere. I listened to her first album and let's just say your heartbreak, it's platinum. I don't know. Maybe this is all wrong. The paparazzi, they're such a nuisance. You know, I can't even let the kids ride the bus anymore. And I don't know, I'm just not comfortable with all this attention. I know. That'll go away once they realize how boring you are. Just focus on Nikki. I mean, her coming back into your life, that's pure kismet. Is that your word of the day? Maybe. But you know I'm right. You can't tell me that it's not destiny. I don't know. I guess it just feels more like an awakening. Well, let her. Let her wake all of you up then. Yeah. I guess you're right. Whoa… what are you doing with that? It's winter. I need a jacket. Oh. Are you going into matrix? No, you're going to borrow my coat. Look, the first rule of fashion, nothing upgrades a man's sex-appeal like a nice dress coat. Who told you that? Every girl I've ever dated. All right. Hi, um, reservation for two for Nikki. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Oh, excuse me, that seat's taken. Thanks. Don't worry about it. Nikki just left the hotel. You're Chris Marshall, right? Yeah. I'm JC Sylvestor from the record company. It's nice to finally meet you, man. Oh… I'm sorry, I didn't know she invited you. She didn't, but I made the reservation and honestly, I just came by to thank you. Oh. Okay… You know, this whole thing you got going on with Nikki is fantastic. I mean, the public is just eating it up. Let's be honest, who wouldn't sympathize with a widower? No disrespect. I mean, let's just say you have reignited her career. Well, that wasn't my intention. Doesn't really matter. Listen, here's a little something for you. Uh… What's this? Let's just call it a token of the record company's appreciation. Dinner's on us. Ah, I'm gonna go. Listen, you should know that when you leave tonight, there's probably gonna be some paparazzi out there waiting to take your picture, blah, blah, blah. If you could, let's just turn on the charm. You know, it serves both of our interests for Nikki to stay at number 1. And another idea would be, we could arrange a little outing; you, the family, Nikki. Excuse me? You know, ice skating, Central Park, enjoying the holiday season. The public are going to love that. How would they know? How will they know? Listen, a few phone calls to the right people and the paparazzi will be all over it. You don't have to worry, they keep… Listen… My kids aren't available for photographs of any kind. Do you understand? Yeah, I understand completely. Listen, enjoy your dinner and if you could, let's just keep this little meeting between the two of us. I mean, we don't need to ruffle any feathers. Have a good night. ♫ Hey. You beat me here. Hey. Wow. How are you? You look a little flushed. Are you okay? Yeah, it's just, um… Life gets stranger by the minute. Yeah, welcome to my world. Thank you. It's bizarre. That's for sure. Well, luckily I have you to bring a little normalcy to it. Come on. No, really. I'm so happy. Thank you. I mean, it's just like old times. I guess it really is. Do you remember our first date? Yeah, of course. Mike's Sub Shop. You know, they played those 80's videos. You couldn't stop talking about "Take On Me". Still the greatest video of all time. The, uh, sketch animation was awesome, and it does tell quite the love story. Well, yeah, I mean, guy leaves a racing comic strip for love in the physical world. I'd say that's romance. I mean, I think it's evidence that no matter how different your worlds may be, love can still connect you. Well then, to the great 80's band. Ah Ha, and their still relevant music video. Cheers. Mmm. So, Chris… There's something that I want to say. You still have their album. I'm serious. Um… Look, I know that we've both been through a lot of things in our lives, and our worlds are very different now. But, if our feelings are still there… I was hoping that… Hang on. Are you asking me to go steady? Depends. What you think? I mean… What do you say? You want to give it a try? I don't know, I mean, is it possible? I mean, can we make all this work? I'm not saying there won't be challenges, but… I think we should give it a try. Well, then… okay. Okay. Mmm. Oh. I, uh, I smudged your lipstick. Oh, and it's a very pretty colour on you. Thank you. I'll be right back. Excuse me? I thought I saw Nikki sitting here. Uh, yeah… Yeah, you did. Um, she just went to the ladies room. Oh, of course. Forgive me, I'm Henry. Williams, yeah. I've seen your movies. Thanks. Always good to meet a fan. Have a seat. Um, does Nikki know you're here. No. We've been playing phone tag. You may have heard that we recently went through a slight breakup. Really? Because I thought it was more of a solid breakup. Not quite. You see, Nikki and I understand each other's worlds. It's only a matter of time that we get pulled back together. Is… Is that why you're here? That, and to congratulate her on her success. Her Christmas album is number one. It should be. It's great. I'm sure it is. I just didn't think she could pull it off so soon after our break. But I must say rekindling the old flame was a brilliant move. Was that her, or the label's idea? What do you mean? The PR move. The public ate it up like a fairytale sundae. She was in danger of being D-listed, her label was on the verge of dropping her. She proved everyone wrong and that's what makes us so right for each other. We know how to stay on top. Ultimate power couple. Henry, what are you doing here? Hello, darling. No, wait… Where are you going? I'm leaving. Why?! This was a bad idea. I gotta go. Good meeting you. You like an autograph before you leave? Maybe a picture. Stop it, Henry. What? Most people do. Look, I didn't invite him. I don't know why he's here, I swear. No, I get it, Nikki. Emotions sell records, okay, but mine aren't for sale. No, what are you talking about? Oh, come on, your label is paying for this dinner. Your movie star boyfriend shows up, the paparazzi are outside. No. No, they're not. And they wanted me to dismiss you on national television, I didn't do it. Oh, really? Is that why some guy named JC thanked me with this envelope? Look… my life isn't a song, Nikki. It can't be produced. What… Now that he's out of the picture, shall we have dinner? Leave me alone, Henry. ♫ Chris! Chris, please! Please, this is all just a huge mix-up. All I wanted was to have a romantic dinner with you. I promise, it's… Come here… Look, you know me, probably better than anyone else ever has. Everything I said in there was true. You have to know that. I do know you, Nikki. And I know your ambition. Okay, you're famous, and you can handle, maybe even enjoy this whole media circus, but it doesn't work for me, and it definitely doesn't work for my kids. It's not always like this. The point is your teenage dream is now your reality. It just… I'm sorry, but it isn't mine. It's not fair. Just because baseball didn't work out for you doesn't mean you can keep punishing me because my life worked out. My life worked out just fine. Okay? I've got two kids that I love very much. Yeah, I coach basketball, I spend my weekends buried in laundry. I know. It's not a rock star life, but I'm proud of it. Excuse me, please. ♫ ♫ Dad? Sophie, what are you doing up? You should be in bed. I couldn't sleep. How was your date with Nikki? All right… I'm sorry, sweetie, that things with Nikki, they're just not going to work out. Why? I like her. You only like Nikki, because she's famous. No, dad, because she makes you happy. Oh, honey… Come here, sit down. Here… Sweetheart, people like Nikki, okay they belong to the world. She's… it's too much of a risk. One day she might just decide that I'm not good enough and take off. For you, it's all just fun and games, but for me, I mean, it's my heart. It's our family on the line. You're an idiot. Excuse me? You are! She already gave you her heart. You're the one running away. I'm protecting us. From what?? From everything. From publicity, from movie stars, from record labels. I don't get that. Well, you don't have to. Sophie, the point is our family is better off. You love her, I know you do. How do you know that? Girls know these things, okay? She feels it, too. That's why she came back, even after you left her. Unless you really don't love her and you're just pretending. I never said that. Then tell her! Girls need to hear it. All right… All right, you're twelve years old, we shouldn't be having this conversation. Dad, it's not hard just give in to love, take a chance. Like you did when you were fifteen. Yeah, well, I'm not fifteen anymore, Sophie. I have a lot of things to consider. Look, your ideas, your fantasies about love are very charming, but they're also very unrealistic. One day you're gonna wake up and you'll understand all this. Wow. You really know how to break a heart. What's that? Well, I thought we should finish decorating the tree. Look, if Santa's gonna stop here, we need to put on our best face, right? Whatever. Look, Soph, I know you're sore that things didn't work out with Nikki. Hey, it's almost Christmas. Can't we at least try and be happy? Is Nikki coming over to help? Enough about Nikki, okay? Well, she just pulled up. Hey, Jackson. Hey, sweetie. Aww, I missed you guys. Come on you guys, let her walk in, huh? We're decorating, do you want to help? Um, I wish I could. I'm just here to drop something off. Why don't you guys grab the rest of the decorations from the closet, huh? I'm sorry to just stop by. I didn't think anyone would be home. Yeah, well, it's Christmas vacation. Right… Um… I was just gonna leave this at the door, but you know, I have this concert tomorrow night and thought maybe you and the kids and everyone might want to go. Um, I know the kids would love to, but… we've got plans. Family stuff. In case you change your mind. Thanks. Have a merry Christmas. Nikki… I'm sorry. About last night. You gotta know, you mean more to me than you could possibly imagine. But, you and I… I'm sorry, but I just can't take the risk. You know, people always ask me if fame has changed me, and the truth is it hasn't. I've always known who I was going into this. Who I am. Fame just changed everyone around me. You know, some cling and some run. At the end of the day, I'm just Nikki Crandon from New Jersey. A girl who writes and sings songs that sometimes people just happen to hear and like. And my passion has blessed me with a lot of great fortune, which I'm truly grateful for. But I realized it can never buy me what I need. Or want. Most. Which is what I got from you. ♫ When you took my hand in that dark theatre… you really took my heart. I could never love anyone else the way I've always loved you, Chris. You were always the one. Now you're just the one who got away. Again. ♫ I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to have someone to love this Christmas. Hey… come on. I do have someone to love. I have you, baby girl.

Oh… What is it, Sophie's? No, it belonged to Kate. Wow… I didn't even know she was a fan. Well, she used to listen to that CD all the time when you weren't around. She was afraid that it would upset you. I've never really listened to it. Kate said Nikki wrote the soundtrack of her life, because all of her songs are about love. And the time for love is now. She would always say that. That's because it was her favorite lyric. Track twelve. You know what's funny? When Kate and I were dancing at our wedding, I was so nervous. I remember. Etta James, right? Yeah. At Last. I mean, I can't dance to save my life. Two left feet would be an understatement. But, Kate… she just, she leaned into me, she whispered, she said, "don't think… just listen to the song." Kate always knew how to get through to me. Do you still have the tickets Nikki gave us for her concert tonight? Well, it started an hour ago, so I figured it wouldn't make sense. No. No, it makes sense. It makes perfect sense. Come on… Mark!

And Nikki, if you can hear me, I just want to apologize… Nik… Nik. Okay? When my wonderful kids, they brought you back to me, I… my heart soared. I felt alive again. And then I got scared, you know, and I started thinking too much. Sometimes you just gotta listen to the song. Nikki, you're my song. ♫ I love you. I love you. All my life. You go, girl. Uh, you wanna go steady? I thought you'd never ask. I guess there's an encore, huh? Always. I'll meet you back stage. Okay. Uh, Chris Marshall, everyone. The love of my life. I definitely didn't expect this tonight, but I got an early Christmas gift, and um, Sophie, Jackson, thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, everyone! One, two three, four! ♫ ♫
