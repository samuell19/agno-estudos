Not a great while ago, passing through the gate of dreams, I visited that region of the earth in which lies the famous City of Destruction. IN THE COUNTRY OF LAST THINGS These are the last things. One by one they disappear and never come back. I can tell you of the ones I have seen, of the ones that are no more, but I doubt there will be time. It is all happening too fast now, and I cannot keep up. You remember what you said to me before I left. William has disappeared, and no matter how hard I looked, I would never find him. Those were your words. I ignored you, for a change. I told you that I didn’t care, that I was going to find my brother. How long ago was that? Years and years, I think. I feel that William is still alive. He must be somewhere, unless the government has killed him. I will find him sooner or later, and bring him back home. In the city, it is absolutely against the law to bury the dead. All corpses are required to be taken to one of the Transformation Centers. There, through an industrial process, the country obtains the fuel it needs to run. Anyone who does not comply with this law is subject to the stiffest penalty. The Runners and the Leapers are among the most subversive sects. Runners travel in groups, running and running until they drop from exhaustion. Leapers climb to the highest places for no other reason than to jump. Next! I'll give you 20 or nothing. Not what you said last week. Last week was last week. And those earrings? 13 glots. Hi Isabel. -Hi. -How did it go today? Ferdinand will be furious. C'mon. It's been 3 days since I brought anything home. Don't worry. I'll explain it to him. I've lived a while in a room about 4 meters by 6. Ferdinand and Isabel slept apart, each in a different corner, and I slept in a third, separated by a flimsy sheet. You won't last long without good shoes, Anna. I know, Isabel. Thank you. The only thing that helps is to masturbate. Forgive me for being so blunt, but I don't see any point in mincing words. It's a common enough solution under the circumstances. I love your model boats. I'm the best! You could sell some. Sell my fleet?! You're crazy! You'll have to kill me first! I won't part with a single one! Not ever! This is... It's a mutiny! William... William... William... William... Anna, it's too dangerous. I don't care, I'll find him. Your brother hasn't been in touch for months. I sent another man a year ago. Sam Farr. William... William... Haven't heard from him either. I still have Sam's photograph. Just knowing that he was in the city gave me something to hope for. I kept it with me as an amulet, a tiny shield to ward off despair. There are no politics in the city as such. The people are too hungry, too distracted, too much at odds with each other for that. Lockdown regulations were put in place. And the garbage collectors, the first to be banned, made themselves heard. It's essential that you look more like a young man than a young woman. Now you look like a dyke! Ignore him. That ogre. He's an ogre, ignore him Anna. Shouldn't we wake him up? I don't think Ferdinand will ever wake up again. Ferdinand? Ferdinand? The idea was to make him look like a Leaper. At least the neighbors would think that Ferdinand still had some fight left in him. They would see him flying off the roof and say to themselves: This was a man who had the courage to take matters into his own hands. I'll never know if it was Isabel who put an end to Ferdinand's life. Or if his chronic cough did him in. Or if it was simply my hands. I bought the most beautiful dress I could find. It was white, with lace on the collar and sleeves. I think Isabel would have been happy. This is the National Library! Do you have a pass? I'm sorry. I thought all the Jews were dead. It's not so easy to get rid of us. My name is Anna Blume. I'm looking for my brother. William Blume. Blume? Blume. I've never met your brother. I'm also looking for this man. Samuel Farr. He works for the same newspaper as my brother. Yes. I know that name. I've talked to him several times. Intelligent man. Extremely bitter. He lives upstairs, here in the library. He's hidden away. I can take you to him. With your permission. Neither for nor against. Our permit is in jeopardy. We no longer have full academy status. However... I don't see what harm it can do if you take her. This is as far as I can go. Good luck. I'm very grateful. Go away. Is that Samuel Farr in there? Who wants to know? Anna Blume. I'm William's sister! Open the door or I'll tear it down! We knew something happened to William. Nothing is definite in this place. We must keep working in the meantime. There are over 3000 pages here. I've interviewed hundreds of people. All their stories are in there. How much money do you have? Twelve glots. I have some left. I need a place to live. William used to talk about you. Don't worry. I won't get in the way. It's a lucky thing the gun wasn't loaded. William... William... William... William... It's unbelievable. I believe it. I must continue the interviews. I'll go to the municipal market. Not in those shoes. You wouldn't get far. I have a surprise for you. Cigarettes! The perfect meal. The power only runs 3 hours a day. How I miss you my love, I wonder why My life lacks meaning if you're not here How I miss you my love, what can I do? I miss you so much, I'm going crazy Oh divine love! You have to hurry up And come back to me The pain is strong and I bear it I'm looking for William Blume. Anyone heard of William Blume? Excuse me. William Blume? Journalist? He came here 4 years ago as a foreign correspondent. Blume? Heard of the Smilers? No. The Smilers are a sect. They believe bad weather comes from bad thoughts. A dark or pessimistic thought produces a cloud in the sky. And that's why we have the Rushers. They want to rush everything until it explodes. Sam. I'm so cold. Can I sleep beside you? Weren't you ever taught to knock? I'm sorry. I'm looking for the Rabbis. They cleared out two days ago. The new laws. Haven't you heard? And you are? My name is Édouard Dujardin. I'm an anthropologist. Please, sit. No, I'm good. Thank you. Till next time. Anna? The Rabbis. What about them? They lost their academy status just like Jacob said. They're gone. The expulsions have already started. Don't cry, Anna. I'll make you some tea. That was how I survived that winter. We burned books to keep warm. I helped Sam with his book. For the next six months, that small room was the center of my world. It was all bodies at first, a mad crush and tangle of limbs, a splurge of pent-up lust. Then the pace died down, and little by little, over the weeks that followed, we actually fell in love. It wasn't tenderness or the comforts of a shared life. We fell deeply in love, and in the end it was as though we were married, as though we would never leave each other again. Those were the best days for me. Not just here, but anywhere. The best days of my life. Any luck? I might as well be talking to stones. Perhaps he went south? Like many others. Even the birds have been shot. There are no animals left. Come here. I want your body next to mine. Do you think about your life before? Before what? The crossing. All the time. I can't help but remember the maple trees on Miro Avenue. The Roman numeral clocks. The green neon dragon sign on the Chinese restaurant. The toy boats on the pond in Erasmus Park. Sam. I think I'm pregnant. Miss Blume. How do you know my name? You're looking for your brother, William Blume. Do you know where he is? Unfortunately, no. What I've heard is... You need shoes. Maybe I can help with that. Who told you that? Your boyfriend has been asking around. How do you know where to find shoes? I have a cousin who's in the business of buying and selling... Used things, consumer articles. He might have what you want. I'm seeing him tonight. I can't spend much. That can be arranged. I'll see you later then. "...but still no news about William." Anna. Do you know what this means? What? We have overturned the odds. Don't be dramatic. Have you seen any children since you got here? I'm not here to save the human race. I came to bring William back. I know. I know. We'll need diapers. You'll have them. You'll have them. Miss Blume. It's your lucky day. Take a good look. I’ll pay for the other one, too. I don't have it with me. What do you mean? My cousin is waiting for us to complete the transaction. There are still some decent people left in this world. Miss Blume. This is my cousin. He wanted to meet you. And so... Here's your other shoe. Try it on. Slip it on. It'll fit nicely. Have a glass of milk, Miss Blume. Try it on, it'll fit. Murderers! SOUTH SOUTH SOUTH SOUTH Hello. I'm glad you're alive. Am I? You're injured and your left arm is broken. But you are alive. I'm Victoria Woburn. And this is Woburn House. My father was a doctor. He died shortly after opening this place. We do the rounds on Wednesdays. We go out to help those who can't get here by themselves. You found me by accident? They drove by as you crashed through the window. The only thing we managed to save was your blue notebook. I left it there. I wasn't trying to kill myself. I would never do that. I'm pregnant. I'm so sorry. Your name? Anna. I'll be back in a bit. Try to get some rest. A fire had broken out in the library. If Sam had survived, there was no way to find him. If he had died... Everything was lost for me. I would never see him again. The ache, then, did not disappear. Little by little, I noticed I was crying less. I once discovered that I had managed to go three hours without thinking of Sam. Good morning, how do you feel? Better. Thank you. I brought you tea. We also washed your coat. I read it a long time ago. Good choice. Time to get out of bed. I'd like you to meet some people. I wonder what's better. To help many people a little bit or just a few people a lot? -Good morning. -Good morning. Hi Maggie! Maggie cooks for all of us. My father's methods have provoked a lot of envy. But as you might imagine... Nobody will return to the streets. I understand. I want you to meet someone I trust. Good morning, Otto. I brought a guest. Good morning. My name is the same backwards and forwards. Just like yours. Miss Anna. That’s why you got to be born again. Excuse me? Mr. Frick and Pedrito rescued you. You were dead. Saw it with my own eyes. You came back to life. Pedrito? He's my grandson. Hi. She's Anna. Hi Anna. Anna, please sit. There's so much work. So much to do. We're not enough. You know, Anna... We've given you special treatment. Because I need your help. I just came to find my brother. Broken hearts are sometimes mended by work. Could you pass the salt? Put it there. It's bad luck. Enough with the salt crap! Look at what that nonsense has gotten us! Don't be a fool. Politicians got us here. Excuse me. Could I have one? I haven't smoked in ages. Princess Anna in the flesh. I'm Boris Stepanovich. Victoria. I see you noticed my cigarette case. It belonged to a tsarist general captured by the Red Army. Beautiful. Don't believe a word he says. Boris was a great friend to my father. His best disciple. She's exaggerating. What priceless treasure do we have this time? China teacups. I found them on the second floor. Under the bedroom table. Perfect. Want to tag along? Why do you do all this? I promised Woburn I'd take care of Victoria. He saved my good leg. Wait for me here. My dear friend. Who is she? My niece. Nothing to worry about. What do you have for me today? The offer of a lifetime. Straight from the Old World. Take a good look at this teacup. Hold it against your lips. Imagine you're drinking tea. Please help me. Help me. You know what I want. Not negotiable. Leave! Get out! Keep walking, don't look back. Don't stop or we're sitting ducks. -What did the slave want? -Help. Many of them are trapped. I see. Let me explain. Woburn House is built on a foundation of clouds. It seems solid to me. For now, yes. But people have heard about our self-sufficiency. They arrive desperate, and they're scared of returning to the real world. So they become bad in order to survive. Name? Come on in. -Age? -28. Someone will see you shortly. Full name? Age? 86 years old. Follow me. This way. Thanks. There were too many people to be helped and not enough people to help them. The arithmetic was overpowering, inexorable in the havoc it produced. Mister Frick. Could you get us beers? If you drink, it's goodbye for you. Lend us your car, man. It's all good. Go do what you need to do. Sometimes I drift off to the old days back home. Remembering how it used to be when I was a little girl and the whole family would go up north on the train. My big brother William would let me have the window seat and I rarely spoke, face pressed against the window, looking out at the scenery. I would say to myself, Anna... You've never seen anything more beautiful. Try to remember it. Try to memorize all the beautiful things you see and then they will always be with you. Even when you can't see them anymore. I don't think I ever looked harder than on those train rides up north. I wanted everything to belong to me, for all that beauty to be a part of what I was. Forever. The odd thing was that none of it stayed with me. I always wound up losing it. In the end the only thing I remember was how hard I had tried. Have you had many men in your life? I've been married twice. The first was what you'd call a brilliant society match. A policeman shot him dead. I'm sorry. Then I met Tommy. He got into politics. Bed 7 will be free on Thursday, right? Such a quiet man. He's quiet, but a big eater too! -He eats for four. -It's true! He ate a lot. It's a cramp. Oh yes. You're so beautiful. It's so good you're here. Welcome, someone will be with you. Go ahead. Come with me. Next please! A spot will open in a month. Thank you, miss. Next! Help me find my husband! He left in June. And I haven't heard back! I'm very sorry. We've been married for 27 years! You have to help me! I'm so sorry, I can't! If the good doctor could hear you talk... He'd be turning over in his grave. William... William... Sam. I waited hours for you to come back. I went looking for you. The library was on fire when I returned. I lived in the old train station with derelicts and madmen. The shadow people... I gave up trying to be anyone. I said goodbye to you, Anna. I said goodbye to the book, to myself. To want nothing, to have nothing, to be nothing. Best solution I could find. In the end, I lived the life of a stone. You're here now. Yes. Yes. And our baby? Come in. Victoria. It's Sam. My Sam came back. Welcome Sam. You're a great cook. The best cook! Hi Sam. You look well. Thanks. Can I speak to you both about something? We've been floundering ever since my father's death. We offer people food and shelter for a while. That's all we can do. If we had another doctor... Maybe we can regain the spirit this place once had. There's no medicine left to dispense. Sam will talk and people will listen to him. If you think a fake doctor will help people feel better... I've no problem. Victoria. I'll go pick the next item for you. Spring came early that year. The nights were warm. Sometimes Sam and I would walk around the garden before turning in. Each time, as we embraced in the middle of the night, it was like falling in love all over again. Pedrito! Some fruit please! Enough. Thanks for the fruit, goodnight. Stop it. That's enough. What are you doing here? What do you want? We know your secret, Mr. Frick. What secret do you know? What secret? This is too risky, Victoria. Private burials are forbidden by law. My father would want it this way. It was his. It's loaded. I want you to have it. She's gone. What? Maggie has left me all alone. -Let me help. -I can do it, thanks. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're in this together. Together. Bodies are for burning. We'd be ruined otherwise. People who commit these acts must be punished. -Officer. -Yes? May I have a word with you? This is the last time. Not one body can be spared! Those who subvert the law will be declared enemies of the state. That's my grandfather! That's my grandfather! That's my grandfather! Come here. The order of things had been smashed. Frick's burial site had become holy ground for Pedrito. And now it had been desecrated. He began going out after dinner, rarely returning before dawn. It was late November, and Pedrito had spun off into his own orbit. An errant star with no definable trajectory. What was that? Stay here. Drop the gun! Pedrito! I wonder... Who cares what you were last week if you know who you are today? Sam has studied the perimeters of the city. Such knowledge will be vital when we escape to the south. The end is only imaginary. A destination you invent to keep yourself going even if you never get there. You stop. But that does not mean you have come to an end. Anna? We're ready. Coming. Perhaps we will find William after we leave the city. But I try not to hope too much. The only thing I ask for now is the chance to live one more day. This is Anna Blume. Your old friend. From another world. Once we get to where we are going... I will try to write to you again. I promise. THE END
