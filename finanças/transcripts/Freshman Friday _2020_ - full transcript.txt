It's spellbinding. - Spellbinding? - Good morning, freshmen. - [Group] Good morning. - [Price] And congratulations on your acceptance into the prestigious St. Alans College. (applause) - We did that. We did that. - Shorty, what? - I'm Dr. Price, your Dean of Academics. Some call me HNIC. Some call me, Boss, but you can call me Dr. Price. - Hey, Dr. Price. - [Price] Please, take a moment and look to your left. Now to your right. One of them, won't make it past their first year. The other will have a child or an STD before they graduate. Now, I know you want to have fun, but don't forget why you're here. Now, my office is just next door. My hours are posted. Please, I'm here if you need advice, have a question, or just want to talk. Now, with that said, please enjoy your first Friday as a college student because you will only get one freshman Friday. (shouting and clapping) Before I excuse you for today, we have a presentation. This is a brief documentary on the history of this institution. - [Lady] St Alans College was founded in 1876 by James Harper, Jr. When settling here to build his great college, he quoted, "Education will blossom on the very lands that grew such a beautiful rosebush. Let it not be touched by man." - We're doing good, but which one of you all about to end up with an STD or a baby by the end of the year? (men conversing) - Hey, yo, I should run for president. - Whatever. That's whack. - [Mike] Yeah? - [Demetrius] Yeah, yeah, yeah. SCA girls aren't going anyway, right? - [Rasta] What about you, Claxton? - Although intellectual enough, school elections are popularity based instead of issue based, so I'm gonna have to repudiate your offer. - [T Lady] Usher Raymond and his bit round dances ate the competition. (laughs) - Okay, Erykah Bay-don't. (group laughing) - [T Lady] Hello. - Leave him alone, T Lady. Spencer can run, if he wants. - [T Lady] Spencer. - Nah, he's Spence, ma. - Nobody was even talking to you, Justin Timberlake in NSYNC. Boy, bye, bye, bye. - Hold up, hold up, hold up.

That goes for the rest of you making a band too. - Yo, I was just about to give it to them, man. - You weren't going to do nothing, man. - You all still trying to eat, right? What? I'm hungry.

I just wanna... - [Grandma Over The Phone] Listen, listen. Listen, your mother and father, God rest his soul, they'd be so proud of you, okay? I can hear your daddy now. That's a Stanley man right there. And your momma, grinning from ear to ear, calling you her baby boy. I told you, College can be the best time of your life. The friendships you'll have will last forever, and if you're lucky, you might just find love of your life. Lord have mercy. You know I got to watch that fine ass Judge Mathis. (chuckles) If I was five years younger, he could handcuff me and bang that gavel. - Grandma. - [Grandma over the phone ] Sorry. You still got them condoms Grandma bought you, right? Okay, because don't you bring home no ugly babies. Uh-huh. All right. I love you, baby boy. - I love you, too. - Be good. (dramatic music) (police siren wailing) (upbeat music) - You like that, huh? You felt the wrath of that today. I knew you were gonna be a problem, freshman. I can smell the bad apples. - Look, man, it was a mistake. (Officer bangs the doll) - You see, it ain't too late. I'm no security guard. I was top of my class at the Academy, best of the best, until they realized I couldn't say, st st st st, Police. - Stop police? - What? You're gonna come in my line, picking on me, causing trouble? - That's why you couldn't say my name? Spencer St-, St-, St-, St- ... - Oh, but you done gone, did it now. You made it easy for me. You're out of here. You can kiss your education goodbye. Dr. Price will be called on this matter. - Look, man, it was a mistake. - You better sit down before I pull your small intestines out of your ass and use it as a condom to skull fuck you. - I don't know. I just feel a little out of place here? - Nonsense. This is your home for the next four years. - Four years yeah, if I make it that long. - Hey, you'll be fine. Now, get on back to class. - Thanks, Dr. Price. (upbeat music) - Any time. - This is the culprit I phoned you about, sir. - I have it from here, and thank you for your diligent service to this campus. - Look, I can explain. - Before today, that bush had never been touched by man. We're gonna have to expel you, and also a $5,000 fine. - Please, don't kick me out, Dr. Price. My grandma would kill me. I can work off the $5,000 if you need me to, but please don't kick me out. I'm not a bad student. I was just... - [Price] Spencer Stanley the third, born October the 24, in Roanoke, Virginia. Graduated in the top 5% of your high school class. 1510 on your SATs, scholarships to UNC and NC State, but you chose to attend St Alans College, historically black, why? - Because my whole life, all I heard was my family talk about all the fun times they had here. I mean my grandma would talk about, how good it felt to be around 3,000 positive black folks pursuing a common goal, and that was their education. - [Price] So then, I'm sure you heard about our sacred bush. - Dr. Price, I am sorry, okay? I messed up. I just had a moment of insanity and it'll never happen again. - Spencer, standing up, acknowledging, apologizing for your mistakes, is all part of growing up, becoming a man. So, who is she? Angela, young lady from freshman studies. Let me share a story with you. (rock music) - After Vivian Harper and Spencer Stanley kissed, they never separated. I never got a chance to tell her, how I had fallen in love with her. (sighs) There's something about that freshman Friday kiss. - You knew my grandparents? - I Knew them? We were the best of friends, and boy! Did we have some good times. Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm not going to expel you, but you are going to work off that fine. You have to promise me one thing, that when you see Angela tonight, you're going to ask her to dance. - I wasn't sure if I was going. - Oh, you're going. And trust me, you'll thank me later. Yes. Now, the dance is from 9:30-2:00. Show up around 11:00, okay? Confidence is key. - Yes, sir. - Oh, and you're going to start working off that fine today at 5:00 in the cafeteria. You're gonna meet Uke. Now, don't be late. She hates tardiness and she hates procrastination. - Yes sir, thank you. - Yes. (door closes) - Is anyone sitting here? - No, go ahead. - Hey, girl. - Hey. This taste cool? - Yeah. It's okay. - [T Lady] It's all right. - I was just really hungry. - Ew. Look at this. - [Angela] Ew. That is so gross. - Gross. - That is so nasty. - That is disgusting. Ew! - That is so nasty. - It is so good. - T Lady, stop. Oh, my god! Seriously? - Need help with something? (live upbeat music) (footsteps) - Excuse me? - What? - Dr. Price sent me over. - Lucky. You're the damn fool that plucked the rose from the bush. What the hell were you thinking? And who are you fucking? They should have kicked your ass out. - I wasn't. - You weren't thinking? Uh-huh, yes you were. Had to be some pussy. Mm-hmm Turn around. - What? - Turn around. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're all right. I'd get you on a drunk night. - Thank you? (laughs) - But you couldn't handle all this. - Yeah, I'm sure that whoever your man is, he's in love with your cooking an all that. - Shit. I ain't had none in a year, but baby, freshman Friday, it never fails me. Never fails, never ever. Anyway, enough about that. Let's get to work. Get to work. Get to work. Okay, start by going helping Teddy with the tea and the dishes. Oh, and I got my eye on you, freshman. One fuck up and I'm on the phone with Dr. Price, getting your ass kicked out of here. Got it? - Got it. - Excuse me Mr. Teddy? - Come in here with that soft "Mr. Teddy" shit. Man up. Sound off. Who are you? and what do you what? - My name is Spence. I was just sent over here to help you make the tea. - Do it look like I need help making the tea? I've been making tea, even before you was born. Making tea is a man's game. It's not for boys. Besides, you think you got what it takes to come in and replace Ice Tea Teddy? I don't even have to measure. You think you can do this? This is what it takes to make iced tea. Yeah. You think you can do this? You think you got what it takes to replace ice tea Teddy? Your turn, Private. (metallic spoon clanging) Good job, private. Good job. A little bit more ice. Can't teach these doggone privates nothing these days. - (laughs) Word on the street is, you owe the school about five large. - Yeah, man. Something like that. - My brother, my brother. For $8.50 an hour, shoot you might be washing dishes here until you graduate. - $8.50? That's how much I'm making? - You, me, and everyone else in here. (laughs) Look at you all mad. Mean without a college education, you'll be damned if you make that much in these parts. Hmm I'm sure you need (indistinct) (plate shatter break) - [Uke] That's $2 out of your paycheck, freshman. - Man, how the hell did I end up in this place? - [Uke] 'Cause you a dumb ass. - Man, I'm out.

(Spencer laughs) It'll be more comfortable (mumbles). (sighs) - Hello, Spencer. - So you're not made like everybody else? - Mad at what? Money that wasn't even mine? Truth be told, I knew you weren't gonna win. - Well, thanks for the confidence, man. - You didn't even know (indistinct), so early '90s music isn't your forte. If I were an only child, I wouldn't have recognized it either, but I have two older sisters. Don't alarm yourself with respect to the fellas. Everything will be copacetic. Where are you on your way to? - I'm going to save the pregame party. Why don't you tell the rest of the fellas I'm going to the back parking lot. You should go with me. - Are you crazy? They say security won't even go back there man, and most people been there for well over four years. Some don't even go here. You're on your own, but I'll let the fellas know it's on. - All right, man, cool. - All right, man. All right.
