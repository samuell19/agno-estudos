Okay, my turn. Okay, fingers. Okay, I can do it.Okay. Let's hear it. Very good. You got it. I messed up a little. It's fine. I only just taught it to you. Did you always do music, Mom? Since I was a little girl. I had one of those toy pianos and I would just sit all day and just plunk away... just making noise, basically. You love it, huh, Mom? Yeah. Music is... Do you know how you love to draw? Yeah. So, you picture in your head what you're gonna draw before you draw it, right? Mm-hmm. I guess so. Well, writing songs is kind of the same. You hear it first in your head and then your heart and then you write it all down, so, you don't forget. At least it's how it works for me. Only, I use notes. And then it's forever. Then why don't you be a singer? Because I already have two jobs that I love. Running Smokey's and being your mom. I wouldn't trade the second one for anything else in the world. And besides... I can always sing for fun. Yeah. Christmas cookies! Oh, okay. Be careful! Don't forget to use an oven mitt. Love you, Momma. Hello, Nashville music fans, this is Lindsay Wyatt.

I did hear. And so did everybody else in town. Congratulations, you're trending. I don't care about your Grammys! You were nothing before I found you singing in that rathole. I made you.

I hear she's into yoga. You can always talk to her about that. What... Well, that's great advice for Kenny. Yeah. But what about you? Hmm? That guy at table seven's got a huge crush on you.

Let's give it a spin. ♪ String the lights On the roof ♪ ♪ Place a star on the tree ♪ The house is filled With carols ♪ ♪ Being sung by family ♪ ♪ Just like it was When Christmas ♪ ♪ Was young ♪ Ooh... Wow.Huh. Um... Luke, that... That... that song is amazing. That song... It's so sweet and... and nostalgic. Who's Melody Douglass? I don't know, just some wannabe singer-songwriter. Luke, when I was listening just now, it was like... I could imagine being back... under the mistletoe, kissing my first boyfriend. I felt... I felt this... this connection, you know? I want it. You want it? I want to sing it at my Christmas Eve benefit. At the Pearl. In seven days? Mm-hmm. Go get it for me. You just work that... Luke Dawson magic. You get me that and you're still my manager. Consider it done. Okay. Where the hell is Jackson Woods? Coming! Luke? Dawson? Brett Mayfield? Look at you. What are you doing? You live here in Jackson Woods? Yeah, uh, my wife and I, we bought the place a few years back. You're married? So, how can I help you? Uh, looking for a room. Preferably a suite on the top floor if you've got it. Hey, honey, we're all out of 60 watt. Oh, hello. Uh, Luke Dawson, this is my wife, Emily. Sweetheart, Luke and I we grew up together in Knoxville. You're gonna be a dad? Sure am. Wow. Uh, sweetie, can you please take a look... All right. To see what's available for Mr. Dawson here. Oh, yeah. Uh... Goodnight Moon and the Giving Treeare ready. You name your rooms after children's books, cute. Upstairs and to the right. Hey, you guys wouldn't happen to know a Melody Douglass, would you? Yeah, her family owns Smokey's Barbecue, over on 4th there. Thanks man. Good to see ya. Welcome to Smokey's. How many this evening? Uh, what's your name? Olivia. Olivia, I'm going to need a table away from children, please. Actually, never mind, I found one. Oh, uh, sir, you have to let... Dude! Nothing to see here, folks. You okay, Kenny? I'm good. Get yourself cleaned up, and I'll take care of this. Thanks, boss. Your busboy was distracted. Right. Maybe you should not have been texting. Well, feel free to pitch in. LUKE: That's all right. I'm looking for Melody Douglass, do you know her? What if I do? Then I'd like an introduction. And why would Melody want to meet you? It's confidential. Here, you can take that in the kitchen and dump it in the trash. I'm... Do you always put your customers to work? Well, you're not a customer yet. Well, this has been a joy, but I gotta go. Everything good there, Melody? Yeah, I just gotta deal with the food delivery issue. Make sure you rinse the tub when you're done. Melody? Melody Douglass? Luke Dawson. The national talent manager. Dawson and Grimes, that Luke Dawson. Manager of the Year, three years in a row. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember you.Yeah. I tried to see you years ago, but you didn't have any time for me. Finally have an opening in that busy schedule of yours, Mr. Dawson? Yeah, I do have an opening, for you. I'm here to put you on the map, Melody. That's what I do. I make careers happen. Oh, wow. So, you're gonna make all my dreams come true? That's right. And all I need are the rights to your song. And which song would that be for? I've written a lot of songs. "When Christmas Was Young." I don't want to oversell it, it's a nice little song. Make a few tweaks, we rearrange the chord structure and it could be something good. We could do the deal right now if you like. Just like that? Huh. Just like that. No deal. My nice little song isn't for sale. Uh... this is a dream come true for you. What do you know about my dreams? I recommend the chicken and ribs special. Maybe you should get it to go. Be sure to clean up first, yeah? Linds'.LINDSAY: Hey, Luke. Um, I'm in the studio, about the lay down the demo. Uh, please tell me that you have the rights locked up? I'm working on it. I'm in Jackson Woods with the writer right now about to make her dreams come true. Awesome. Great. Well, I knew I could count on you. Later. Hi, uh, if you could send someone to check the heat in my room that would be great. It got a little chilly last night. That someone would be my husband and there are extra blankets in the closet. Okay. You know, you really hurt Brett. Hmm? He said you were like brothers growing up. Before you cut him off. I didn't cut him off. It... We grew apart. It's natural. It wasn't personal. It was, to Brett. He said you were practically inseparable. That you spent nearly every weekend at his house. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. His house was a lot more fun than mine. And then when you graduated you were just gone. Like your best friend never existed. I have to run these boxes of Santa chocolates over to Melody's. Oh, hey. Did you just say Melody? BRETT: Yeah, Douglass. The woman you were asking about. She actually runs Smokey's Christmas Angels. It's the town's, you know, local charity drive. Mind if I tag along? I wouldn't mind checking it out. Maybe I could help? Sure. All right. Looking good, everybody. You're gonna make all our angel families very happy. Hey. Hey there, Brett. Whatcha got? We have chocolate Santas ready for delivery. Well done, you. Kara, this is Luke. We grew up together. Pleased to meet you, Luke. LUKE: Likewise. We have chocolate Santas! Yay. Thanks, Brett. Brett, follow me. We can put these over here. Hey. Oh, uh... the Dishonator returns. Good one. So, uh, how's this all work? Uh, we deliver Christmas care packages to needy families. It seems like a lot of work. Why don't you just order it online, have it delivered. It's not just about the gift. It's also the love and the care that goes in the giving. Ah. Besides, we rely on our donors for everything. Are you here to volunteer? Sure. Great. Great. Um, follow me. Uh... Luke, Olivia. We've met. Luke's gonna take over here for a little while. Just show him once and then he's on his own. Uh, Okay. I'll make a deal with you. I'll wrap presents and you talk to me about your song. I thought I made myself clear last evening. I'm not interested in giving you the rights to my song. It's a good song. I think it could be... Oh, so, now it's a good song. I thought it needed work. It's an excellent song. It just needs a little polish. Mom, who's this? Uh, hi. I'm Luke. Luke Dawson. I work in the music business. And you are? I'm Bailey. Bailey Douglass. - I work in the kid business. - It's nice to meet you. Okay, Bai', um, back to work. Make sure you girls aren't fooling around. Okay. She's funny. Yeah. Barrel of laughs. Wrap gifts or don't wrap gifts, but just stay out of the way. Melody. I got the toy donor on the phone. Says they can't deliver for at least another couple of weeks. Christmas Eve's in six days. That's not gonna work. So... Hi. Yes, this is Melody. Thank you so much for calling me back, uh... We haven't met. I'm Smokey, Melody's dad. Luke Dawson, pleasure. So, I heard. Big time Nashville music manager. Welcome to Jackson Woods.Thanks. Smokey? Smokey, uh, the canned food items are here. Important stuff. Excuse me. Yep. So, what can Emily and I bring to the party tonight? Just your game faces. You know how much we love games. That we can do.Okay. Uh, you can come. Uh, he's probably busy. Yeah, I don't... I don't really do Christmas parties. And I don't know anyone, so... Well, you know Brett, and now me. And Melody. You know what? Work can wait. Count me in. Great. Sure, let's do it. Is it uh... Uh, you're gonna have to show me this whole thing again. ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go ♪ Laughing all the way ♪ ♪ Bells on bobtails ring ♪ Making spirits bright... ♪ Oh, can someone get that? ♪ ...What fun it is...

Charming my friends into getting me to sign over my song. You're not that charming and I'm too stubborn. Challenge accepted. Okay, new category. Christmas songs. Brett, you are up. All right! Come on, Brett! You got this, babe. All right. Okay, sometime before next Christmas, Brett. Yeah! Let's go! Okay, hold on. Okay, wait. Just draw! Okay... uh, sword. FEMALE VOICE: Uh, I don't know.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Who are you? Here we go. I don't know. An ornament! Not getting it. That Christmas Blob? A holiday classic. Oh. Oh! KARA: Okay, ten seconds! Okay, okay. Uh... Um... Not getting it. Hmm... Ring! Ring! Ring! BRETT: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Rock? Bell? "Jingle Bell Rock.""Jingle Bell Rock." Yes! Yes! "Jingle Bell Rock." Emily, you're up. Okay, okay, here comes the pregnant lady. Go Emily! Go Emily! BRETT: Em-ily. Mm. The pie's tasty. Is that your recipe? Uh-huh. All right. So, you were pretty good at the game. Not really a Christmas guy, but I know all the songs. Lots of my clients have done Christmas albums. So, not into Christmas? Well, my parents never really celebrated it. All my presents were clothes or ties, the odd pair of socks. I just kind of developed this "So, what?" Attitude about the holiday. Doesn't mean I don't love your song, though... You just can't control yourself, can you? I am the best at what I do. So, what about your parents? They still around? Yeah, technically. I think they're in Tahiti or Bora Bora right now. I'm not sure. Got it. Not close. They hoped for a doctor. So, no wife? Ex-wife? Wife-to-be? Nope. Never really found anyone who could check all my boxes. Oh, yeah right. Typical guy thing to say. Men never think that maybe it's them coming up short in the box-checking department. Oh, yeah? I don't see any hardware on your finger. What about you? Too personal. That's cool. Redirect. How come you're no longer pursuing a career in music? That part of my life is over. Okay, Mel. It is time for the annual Melody Douglass Christmas Concert. Let's go. Your fans are waiting. Oh. Uh... why don't you go on ahead? I can finish up. Don't want to leave your fans waiting.

How 'bout I walk on the other side of the street... and like three yards back, is that... I guess we can walk together. That was really fun, actually. Ron and Kara are great. Yeah, the best. They've been throwing that Christmas party for over a decade now.Oh. So, what about you? How do you usually spend your Christmas since you're not really into it? Well, let's see. Last year I took clients to Vegas in the company jet. Gambled all night, slept all day. The year before that, Monte Carlo. And this year? Still up in the air. I love Christmas. I especially love finding the perfect gift. I spend all year round trying to find something special for my friends and family, so, they feel cherished and cared for. Listen, Melody, about that song. Let me tell you what I'm thinking... No, no, no. Pitching hours are over. Just relax. Enjoy this moment, under the stars. Shooting star! Where? Where? If you have to ask then you're too late. Okay, this isn't a pitch, but just hear me out. I will get you a killer deal. This is what I do. I know, I know, pitching hours. But I believe in this song. And you do know how many singer-songwriters would kill for the opportunity that I'm offering you. I'm not a million others. I'm just me. I know, but... Look. I get it. You're here for business and that's fine. It's what you do. But I'm not sure how many more ways I can tell you that I'm not interested in giving you that song. I know you said that, but... I'm not interested. Goodbye, Luke. I'm not giving up. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, Angels. There's only five days till Christmas. Be sure to bundle up out there and have fun. And go spread some Christmas cheer. Uh, another lead on toys. It's a long shot, but we've got nothing left to lose. Kara, thank you. You again. Ready to help. Yeah, see, the thing is, I'm not sure if you're really here to help or just to stalk. No, families in need are a good cause. I want to do my part. Melody, I told Olivia I was thinking of trying yoga. Progress. Maybe I can ask her to take a class together some time. Yeah. LUKE: Careful, dude. You don't want to be too available. She won't respect you. Namaste. Don't listen to what he says. You just keep being you, and doing what you're doing. I'm just trying to save the kid heartbreak down the road. Do you really want to help? Just show me how. Fine, I will. Let's see. Um... Looks like everyone is paired up for the Christmas errands. Huh. Aw, bummer. So, you and me then? No, that's not a good idea. Come on, I'll play nice. No selling me. Wouldn't dream of it. I'm in charge. I'm okay with that. Okay, great let's go. Oh! Another house? I don't think I could lift another Christmas tree or hang another Christmas light. One more. And I saved the best house for last. Mrs. Figgins isn't exactly a people person. Don't take it personally. I'll be good. Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you. We need to say hello and then we need to grab the decorations and the lights from the shed out in the back. All right. Hi, Mrs. Figgins. It's Melody and Luke from Smokey's Christmas Angels. Can you believe it's been a year? Yeah. Told ya. Ooh, hello George. Huh? Her husband. Died five years ago. She was actually a friendly person when George was alive. I look good, right? You look ridiculous. Um, I think I have the perfect job for you. How's it going? Almost got it. I can see that. Good luck with the lights. Wait, where are you going? I need to run a few more Angels errands. Don't worry, I have complete confidence in you. Thanks! Okay. Oh. Hi. Hope you don't mind I'm wearing this. It's kind of cold. You think George would mind? I bet he loved this hat. Really keeps the ears warm. I bought it for him, Christmas, 1973. Oh, yeah? How many Christmases did you guys have together? Forty-six. Wow. That's a lot of eggnog. So, what's it like, being with one person that long? When you love the person you're with, it can go by in a blink of an eye. Can't imagine putting up with someone that long. Or someone putting up with you. George loved Christmas. No matter what else was going on or if things were hard. Christmas was always special. Because of the traditions that we created and we shared together. George sounds like he was pretty cool. He was the love of my life. I hope to find that one day. Oh, it is cold. You've been working hard. Would you like to come in and have some hot cocoa? Sounds great. Hey! There she is. Just in time. Oh.MELODY: Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, we're just about to light her up. Oh, Luke did a wonderful job.Aww... I even helped. Okay, everybody gather round.MRS. - Ooh. Figgy, you want to do the honors? Oh, yes. Figgy? Oh! Oh, it's lovely.Yeah. Okay, so, what's your secret? Secret? Mrs. Figgins is a borderline recluse. No. No secret. I just found her weak spot. It was George. You exploited an old lady's weak spot? Well, exploited's a little harsh. I connected with her. She's just lonely. I guess I can relate. Hey, you up for a drink? A little music? I'm really tired. Come on! Buy me a drink. Seriously? My treat? Reminder, no song talk.

No, I just think he's got talent. Auld Lang Syne's one of my favorite songs. It's so nostalgic and so hopeful. Whenever I hear it, I think about New Year's Eve in our house when I was little. My mom and dad would just dance up close underneath the mistletoe as the Guy Lombardo version would be playing on our scratchy old record player. Oh. Yeah. No, I got songs like that. Whenever I hear 'em they just take me back to a certain time. It's like, no matter what I'm doing or where I am, I just... the memories come flooding back. Songs and lyrics are like the memory markers for our soul. Yeah. So, what's your song? Uh... All right. I'm 14, it's the freshman Christmas dance. Last dance. And I'm cheek to cheek under the disco ball with Tiffany Williams. Oh, she's the prettiest girl in the school. Bing Crosby singing "White Christmas." I'm so nervous I can't even look her in the eye. And even then, as terrified as I was, as stupid as I felt... I knew I was in a future memory. Anyway, the song ends and just before the lights come up, she leans in... and she kisses me. And then, she smiles... and just walks away. That was my first kiss. Every time I hear "White Christmas" I'm right back on that dance floor with Tiffany Williams. Man! And Tiffany? What happened? Oh, she never talked to me again. And why do you think that was? I told her I loved her. Oh! Too soon? Yeah. Maybe just a little too fast. Yeah, well, I've never said it since. ♪ ...For Auld Lang Syne ♪ We'll take... I think you're right. I think, uh... music does mark the memories.

Your one condition. Thank you. I'm hungry. Is the food good here? Today was a good day. So, do you feel differently now? About what? Christmas. Maybe there's more to it than I thought. Can I ask you something? Sure. What happened to Bailey's father? Ah, that... Michael left when Bai was seven. He went to the store one evening and never came back. I'm sorry. That sounds tough. I guess life turns out the way it's supposed to. I don't know if I believe in all that trusting the universe stuff. I think you gotta bend life to your will, you know? If you want something, you gotta go get it. And how's that going for you? Go ahead. No. It can wait. So, tell me something about you that would surprise me. Okay. Uh, I make a killer pasta sauce. Really? Let me prove it to you. How 'bout tomorrow night? I'm making this look easy. Hey! LUKE: Hey, you want to be my sous-chef? Yeah. Wait, what's a shoe chef? Come here. All right, you can help me out here. Okay. All right, you look almost as cool as I do in my apron. All right, grab some of that parsley.Okay. You're gonna stick it right in here. Okay. All right, good. Give that a stir. Okay. Perfect. You're a natural. Okay, let me try it. Oh, yeah, check that out. Mm! Amazing. Amazing. Bailey says it's good. All right. You want to try the spaghetti? Yeah. Let's test it out here. How do we do that? Okay. Ooh, ooh, hot! Okay, take this.Okay. All right, now, throw it up at the ceiling. If it sticks, it's done. BAILEY: Cool! Um, excuse me. You're not gonna... One, two, three! One, two, three! Oh. It stayed! Let's eat! All right. You're... Oh, I'll get that down later. Uh-huh. I have to admit, your sauce wasn't bad. Mm-hmm. Our sauce, right Bailey? Whatcha drawing, baby? Um, it's a surprise. MELODY: Ah. I don't believe it. Problem? My new lead on toys just fell through. This hurts. These kids can't go without toys at Christmas. It's just not right. That's too bad. It's more than too bad. Toys create lasting memories for kids at Christmas. This is so frustrating. I get it. Hey, thanks for letting me make you guys dinner. You seem to enjoy cooking. You cook often? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Though it's not as fun cooking for one. Katie and the carolers! Okay.

He doesn't seem to like you much. People drift apart. Is that what happened with Brett? I lost touch. It's not just Brett. I mean... lots of people, friends I grew up with. And why's that?

No wonder Mrs. Figgins fell for you. Only someone with real talent could write a song like that. What about the other songs you've written? Wow. Melody. I'm impressed. Ancient history. I don't write anymore. Why's that? I moved on. Besides, I'm a single mother. I don't have the luxury of impossible dreams. That's too bad. I was looking forward to hearing one of these. I always heard a song is the window to a writer's soul. And you want to see into my soul? Just a peek. Maybe someday. I better call it a night. I need to finish getting these gift bags ready for the Angels.Oh. Come on, I'll let you out. All right. Did I say something wrong? No. No, I just... I gave up on that dream a long time ago. And I'm okay with that. I don't believe you. I think music still inspires you. And I think you got a lot left inside you. Look, whether you give me your song or not, I hope you don't give up on music. Thanks. I had a nice time tonight. Good night, Luke. Luke. Ted. Thanks for, uh, thanks for picking up. Listen, um, I need a favor. A favor? Yeah, from your music charity. And lest we forget the double date prom night from hell. MELODY: Oh. Where both Justin and Tommy forgot their wallet. I will never believe they didn't plan that. Worst prom ever. Okay, enough of that. Here, a toast. To love and friendship. Love and friendship. So, enough about friendship. Let's talk about love. You seem smitten. Smitten? Oh, come on, Kara. No. No. It's just because it's the holidays. And you know how much I love Christmas. It has nothing to do with Luke. Oh, you said Luke, not me. You and Luke, you have a connection. It's so obvious. Kara, he's just here to try and get my song. So? That doesn't mean he's not into you. Besides, you are a catch and Luke sees that. What? How do you know what he sees? Because I see it. You're special. You know what I think? I think Luke gets under your skin. He makes you think about things you don't really want to think about. Like what? Singing, music. That's crazy. And besides, I... I no longer have the luxury of impossible dreams. Right. What happened to dream big and let your dreams be your wings? I never said that. Your senior yearbook quote. You gotta be kidding me. You remember that? Mm-hmm.Oh. Look, all I know is that Luke has feelings for you. I know it, you know it. And you know what? I think you feel the same. Checkmate. I guess I'm buying dinner tonight. Thanks for coming out. I wasn't sure that you would. Well, I wasn't going to, but... Melody said I should at least give you a shot. Besides, I'm not one to pass up a beer. Especially when somebody else is buying. Look, Brett, I'm, uh... not really good at apologies, you know? Why'd you leave like that, Luke? I mean, we can be honest right now, right? Did I do something wrong, or... No, man. It wasn't you. It was... I don't know. I guess I thought in order to find success I needed to... erase my past. Reinvent myself. And you needed new friends for that? You were there for me when no one else was. I'm sorry I didn't return that favor. When's the last time you've seen the guys? I don't even know. I got all caught up in trying to be somebody. You already were somebody to us, man. Number 84, Luke "Butterfingers" Dawson. Man, you drop one pass, you're branded for life. Hey, you know the annual game's coming up, right? Game? Yeah, we get together every New Year's Day, play a little bit of flag football with the old team. Bring the families together, have a big cookout. Oh, man I'm sorry I missed that. Yeah, well, you know, we called you at first, but you never really responded. I want to be better... a better friend. True friends are too rare to just toss aside. I'll tell you what, you show up to this year's game, and bring the beer... I might just forgive you. Consider it done. To old friends and fresh starts. Cheers.Cheers. I did kick your butt at darts, you gotta admit it, you're still Butterfingers, still Butterfingers. Man, we gotta do this again and I don't mean in 15 years. You got it. Sounds good. Hey, you need a ride? Uh, I think I'm gonna hang out for a bit. All right, man. Hey. Hey! So? How'd it go with Brett? Good. We worked it out over a game of darts at Charlie's. Fun bar. Thanks for the assist, by the way. Actually, you know what? You haven't even seen the best part of Jackson Woods yet. Oh, no? Come on. I want to show you something. All right. So peaceful. This is where I come to think... and write. Ever since high school. I wrote "When Christmas Was Young here". So, tell me something, how did you get started in being a music manager anyway? Let's see, when I first started off I just was going to clubs and coffee houses, just looking for that fresh voice. That one talent that would launch my career. And then one night I ended up in this beer joint called Brandy's... and, uh... that's when I saw her for the first time. She was by herself on stage... beat up guitar, microphone. That was the night I met Lindsay Wyatt. And she signed on and more clients followed and then, uh... Shoot, before I knew it I had it all. So, what happened? I Googled you I know you got fired. I don't know. I guess I started believing my own press clippings. The Luke Dawson hype became my reality. Dangerous.Yeah. Maybe I lost my way, got swept up in things that don't matter, but I still know talent. And when I heard your voice, when I heard your song... I had that same feeling I did when I first heard Lindsay. It makes me wonder... why'd you give up on music? Really? I moved on. I don't believe you. The truth is... I'm afraid. Afraid? I'm a single mother. My dad's on his own, there's the restaurant. I have responsibilities. And what if I fall in love with performing all over again and... it doesn't happen? I don't know if I could face another heartbreak. Not long after I graduated from college... I decided to leave Jackson Woods and head to Music City. I thought I could just show up on a Monday in Nashville and get a record deal by Friday. The reality was a bit different.Yeah. I couldn't get a meeting, much less a chance to sing any of my songs. And then you... Oh, man. I remember sitting on your waiting room couch, clutching at my demo. So excited to meet this hot, young new music manager. And then you finally came out of your office and... before I could even get my name out... you walk right past me and out the door. As if I wasn't even there. I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did that. When I was in Nashville, I got a call that my mom was sick. So, I put away my dreams and headed home. She needed me. Dad too. After Mom passed, I realized that maybe her getting sick when she did was a sign that my musical dreams just weren't meant to be. I wish that you believed in your gift. As much as I do. If you don't do it for yourself, do it for Bailey. If she sees you following your dream, maybe she'll have the courage one day to follow hers. Lindsay, I told you I'd get you the song, Okay. Don't worry. I got this. "Don't worry. I got this. Consider it done." Luke... Luke will you just stop with the empty promises, okay? I built my finale around this song. If you don't close the deal, you're fired. Hello? Are you alive? Good news, songwriter just texted. The deal's now closed. "When Christmas Was Young" is now yours. Good! Okay. Good work, Luke. It's gonna be so worth it. I'll see you at the show.Yeah. Mom, Luke's brought us gifts. You can go first. Okay. Oh. Wow! This is awesome. Thank you. Can you help? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, I love it. So, you don't forget who you are. Hmm. Okay, your turn. Okay. Here goes. Oh, Luke... This is so beautiful. And then wind it up with the key there. "Auld Lang Syne." I love it. Thank you. Luke, we have one for you. All right! Here you go. Go on and open it. Don't mind if I do. Oh, man. This is perfect. Do you like it? Oh, like it? I love it. This is... Thank you. Those gifts were incredibly thoughtful. You're welcome. Can this day get any better? I can think of one thing that'd make it better. An inspiring and heartfelt Christmas song. You are relentless. When I believe in something, yeah. On that note. My Christmas gift to you. I wrote my first song when I was 15. Songwriting's like my journal. Melody... This is the best Christmas gift I've ever gotten. Maybe some of these are even worth recording. So, are you saying you... I want you to represent me. Would you want to be my manager? I'd be honored. So, have you thought about where you want to start? I've been thinking about getting out there and performing again. We can make that happen. We can do that. You believe in my gift and I believe in yours. And I want "When Christmas Was Young" to be my first single. Melody, this is... this is so great and... and you should definitely record that song. As your manager... I feel obligated to tell you that if Lindsay records it... you're gonna get paid. And I mean, really well. And you can use that money to launch your career. You can still record it, just, it'll already be a hit by then, but... "When Christmas Was Young" is more than just another song to me. I wrote it... as a gift to my mom, I sang it to her on her last Christmas Eve. Though I didn't know it at the time. She loved it. Said it reminded her of our family Christmases when I was little. How special they were. Mom would have wanted me to record it first. So, are you in? Of course. Okay, look, I... I gotta get going. Get going? I make you my manager and you're already running out on me? Your new manager's gotta tell Lindsay that she can't record the song. A new artist is gonna cut it. Okay. We'll touch base later, yeah? I'll let myself out.Okay. Linds', it's Luke. Please call me, I have an update. It's very important we speak right away. Linds, it's me again. Please call me back. I really need to speak to you. Country Heart 99 welcomes the one and only, Lindsay Wyatt. Good morning, Lindsay. LINDSAY: Well, good morning. Alexa, volume to eight. Okay, Lindsay, off the air you were telling us about a new song you were excited to debut this Christmas Eve.Hmm. Mm-hmm. That's right. And it's called "When Christmas Was Young" and I'm so excited to be singing it for the first time tomorrow night at The Pearl. So, tell us a little bit about how this song came to be. Alexa, volume zero. LINDSAY: Well I was in the... Don't be a stranger, Dawson. LUKE: You can count on it. I'll see you at the game on the 1st. Melody? Brett, Emily, do you mind? I need a moment with Luke. Yeah, sure, we'll just... Take your time. I was just on my way over to give you the good news... How could you? How could I... You gave away a song that wasn't yours to give. And after everything I shared with you, after I asked you to be my manager? I never should have trusted you! Melody, please, let me explain. I just heard Lindsay on the radio, gushing over her new song that she's gonna sing at the Christmas Eve benefit, "When Christmas Was Young." My song! I told... when I.. No, I don't want to hear any more of your explanations! Just the truth, Luke. You owe me that! I'm trying to tell you. You lied to Lindsay and you told her I gave you the rights to my song. No! I... I mean, yes, I did, but... I'm not surprised your clients left you. They must have felt betrayed. Who knows how many times you've been lying to them too. Melody... I was fine with letting go of my dream. Until you showed up. I never should have let you in. Melody, I talked to Lindsay. No, you're exactly the person I thought you were the first time you walked into Smokey's. Melody, I need you to hear me out. It's not what you think. Luke, get your hand off the door. I just need two minutes. Luke, I thought I made myself clear. Your time is up. I'm gonna get this out. I came to Jackson Woods to make a deal, all right? I made lots of deals before and I thought this would be easy. I'd just swoop in, wow you with promises of fame and fortune and voila, you'd sign over your song and I'd be on my way. Client happy, career saved. But then I met you. And at first you were a total mystery to me. But then you made me see my life... in a whole new way. Melody, "When Christmas Was Young" is an amazing song and the world needs to hear it. But it shouldn't be on my terms, it shouldn't be on Lindsay's. It shouldn't be on anyone's but yours. I called Lindsay and I told her she couldn't have the song. She fired me. So, if this ends here, if this is the last time I see you then just... Promise me. Promise me you won't give up on your dreams. 'Cause I'd hate to think that I was the cause of you giving up something that you truly cared about. Something that you were born to do. I have to go. Goodbye, Luke. I'm just sick about the toys. I know. The kids are gonna be so disappointed. I... Hey. You did everything you could. Looks like we got a last-minute delivery. What is it? I have 200 more in the van. It's a mini keyboard. Who are they from? Uh, it says Ted Grimes Music Academy. Never heard of it. Oh, yeah. Sign. Dawson Grimes. Mom, it's just like the one you had when you were little. Yeah. You're right. Awesome news, everybody. Looks like we're gonna have a musical Christmas for the kids this year. Okay, okay, everybody. There's a lot of work to do. Let's go. You okay? It's Luke. He hurt me and... then he comes through with 200 keyboards for the kids. I just don't know which is the real Luke. I don't know if I can trust him and... I'm afraid. I'm afraid if I give him a second chance... I know all about second chances. Thank goodness your mother gave me one. Or else you wouldn't be here. But I thought you two always had this perfect relationship. There's no such thing. Soon after we got married... I had a few lessons to learn about being a good husband. I learned them. And your mother forgave me. I was smart enough not to let her down again. Luke wants my song. The Christmas song I wrote for Mom. Well, if you're holding onto that song for your mother's sake, then know this... your mother was proud of you and she just wanted you to be happy. So, I know she'd want you to go after your dream. And, sometimes, dreams come true in the most unexpected ways. Dad... She's watching over you. I miss her. Yeah. ♪ It isn't Christmas ♪ Without you here ♪ ♪ It isn't Christmas Without you near... ♪ ♪ ...It isn't Christmas ♪ It isn't Christmas ♪ It won't be Christmas ♪ Without you here ♪ Joy to the world ♪ The Lord has come ♪ Let earth receive ♪ Her King I'm happy if you guys are happy. Sounds fabulous. Yeah? Hey. LINDSAY: Hey. You showed. You invited me. Hey, uh, Linds, just to confirm, "When Christmas Was Young" is back on the set list. Yes, yes. Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, I told you Melody didn't give you the rights to that. What are you... MELODY: You sure about that? - Lindsay, I'm Melody Douglass. - Hello! It is such a pleasure to meet you at last! Oh, um... Oh, I guess, uh... we should fill you in. Your former assistant Stacy gave Melody my number and she called me, filled me in on everything and said that I could have the song on two conditions. First being that I rehire this, this manager of mine. And that she could invite as, as many people as she wanted to the show. Melody, are you... are you okay with this? Yeah, I'm sure. And you were right. I'm not ready to give up on any of my dreams. And what better way to launch my career than to have Lindsay singing my song here tonight. Thank you. Lindsay, do you mind? My daughter is a huge fan. - Oh, no, of course. - I'd love to meet her. Smile, Luke. You just got your Christmas wish. Lindsay, this is my daughter, Bailey. Hi! Hi. You're so cool. I can't believe I'm meeting you. I can't believe I'm meeting you. Come on, I have a spot for you to watch from backstage. Okay. Thank you. LINDSAY: Thank you. Have a great show. Thank you. Hmm. So, seems like the client made the deal this time, huh? It does kind of look that way.
