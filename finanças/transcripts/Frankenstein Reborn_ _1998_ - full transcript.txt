[dramatic scary music] [flames crackle] [flames roar] [thunder cracks] [dramatic creepy music] [dirt shuffles] [shovel thuds] [liquid pours and sizzles] [bones crunch] [dark brooding music] [wolf howls] [hooves clop] [carriage rattles] [dramatic choral music] [horse neighs] [footsteps shuffle] [knocker thuds] [door creaks open] - Who the devil do you think you are knocking at this door in the middle of the night? How did you get in here? - I'm Anna. - What? - I'm Anna Frankenstein. I'm supposed to be- - You're not supposed to be here until tomorrow afternoon. We are not ready for you. - Yes, I know. They put me on an earlier train. - Well, it's a nuisance. - I'm sorry. [footsteps shuffle] [door thuds shuts] [tense music] - Put it there and wait here. Don't go wandering off. [knock thuds] [door creaks open] [footsteps shuffle] - Victor? - No. [tense brooding music] - Come on. [footsteps shuffle] [door creaks shut] [footsteps shuffle] - So you're my late brother's daughter? - Yes. - So he and his wife manage to get themselves killed in an accident. Now I suppose I'm stuck with you. Is that it? - I'm sure they didn't mean to be an inconvenience. - No, I'm sure they didn't. This is not just my home. It's where I conduct my work, my experiments. When you're in the castle, you are to remain in your room. You can go down to the kitchen for your meals. During the day, you can go out and romp in the woods or do whatever it is that young girls do. Do not wander around the castle, inside or outside. This is my home. I want it respected. Do you understand? - I think so. I don't romp, though. [chuckles] Do you have any books. - Books? Do you mean you read? - Yes, I read. Do you have any books? - I have a library full of books, but I can't have you wandering about in there. I'll have Frau Herstner find you some children's books. That's all. Take her away, Herstner. [slow dramatic music] - Yes, sir. Come on. [footsteps shuffle] [door opens] [door shuts] - That man coming out of my uncle's study, who was he? - That's Herr Ludwig. He help your uncle with his experiments. You aren't to bother him. - What experiments? - Beg your pardon? - What exactly does my uncle experiment on? - What business is that of yours or mine? You ask a great many questions. - Do I? How am I supposed to learn anything if I don't ask questions? - You know, in a proper young lady, curiosity is an extremely unattractive attribute, something else we have to work on. Here. - Are there any other kids my age? [door opens] [footsteps shuffle] [door shuts] Never mind. [footsteps shuffle] [slow dramatic music] [crickets chirp] [deep muffled rumble echoes] [footsteps shuffle] [dramatic music] [machinery clicks and whirs] - Now pull the levers. Elevate the frame. [crank clicks] It lives! There's a pulse. [heels clack] - Stay here, eat your breakfast, then go out and play, but not around the castle. - Is there anyone else my age? [feet thud] [serveware clinks] Hi. I'm Anna Frankenstein. Hi, I'm Anna. Hi, I'm Anna Frankenstein. Hi, I'm Anna Frankenstein. Hi, I'm Anna Frankenstein. [feet thud] [soft dramatic music] Hi, I'm George Frankenstein. - Nice to meet you, George. [footsteps shuffle] [birds chirp] [footsteps shuffle] [rooster crows] [footsteps shuffle] Hello again, George. - Oh, it's you. My name's Anna. - Oh, I like that better. Mine's Thomas. Look, don't tell your uncle that I'm talking to you, okay? - Why not? - Maybe he's afraid you'll find things out. Any idea what that sound is? - Like, find what things out? - This shaft isn't part of the original construction. It's only been here a few years. They brought in workers all the way from Hildesheim to build these shafts, do some other work down in the basement of the castle. Nobody knows what. - For my uncle's experiments? - I suppose, some sort of mischief, anyway. - What does he do down there? - Don't know. - Wouldn't you like to know? - On one hand, I do, but on the other, I'm not sure that I'd like what I found out. - It's very risky. - It would be at that. Of course, I sleep in the groundskeepers lodge, not the castle. - Oh. - But I can get into the castle. - You can? - Sure. You know, George, there's a trick to poking around. Start when you're about five and you make all your mistakes when you're too young to earn more than a beating. By the time you get old enough to get into real trouble, you don't make any more mistakes. - So you know the inside of the castle. - Inside, outside, all around, except for the basement. That's locked up real tight. Nobody goes down there except for the baron and Ludwig. - Show me. [tense music] [lock clicks] [key slides] [lock clicks] [door creaks open] - Not bad. Ready for the grand tour? - Do you know where the library is? - I know where everything is. - Can you take me there? - Come on. [dark ethereal music] [crickets chirp] - These are all medical books. Anatomy, physiology, chemistry. They're books of experiments. [footsteps shuffle] Look. Subject, white rat, D by D. Do you have any idea what that means? Wait. Length, length of exposure, 12 seconds. No reaction. Subject, white rat. Subject, dog, D by D, D by D. Now it's different. D by P, cyanide injected. - What's cyanide? - It's a poison. - D by P, death by poison, and D by D, death by drowning? - You know a lot, don't you? Reading and books and things? - I don't know as much as I'd like. Here, see if you can find anything else. I'm gonna check the last volume. [footsteps shuffle] [footsteps shuffle] See what else there is. - That's no good. Can't read. - You can't read? - I never bothered with it. - I'm sorry. - Why? I'd like to see how well you do in a garden. - This isn't the current volume. It only goes up to March. Subject, dog, D by P, cyanide. Length of exposure, 28 seconds. Revivification achieved 2nd of February, 12:43 PM. Pulse, heartbeat, erratic; breathing, labored; behavior, agitated and aggressive. Refused food. Lived 42 hours, 20 minutes. - What's all that mean? [dog barks] [tense music] - I don't know. [horse neighs] [dog barks] [footsteps shuffle] You know him? That's Ludwig, your uncle's assistant. - Yeah, I've met him. - He lords over the rest of the staff, that's for sure. Actually like he runs the castle. [dog barks] [cart rattles] - What's that on the cart? Looks like a coffin. - Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Wonder whose. - Limbs are in good condition. We'll salvage those. Thorax is useless. Viscera is necrotic. - The head? - Useless. We'll start with the arms. I wanna try to save the major muscle groups of the shoulders. Right, let's get started. - Over here's the last one. [birds chirp] [tense brooding music] - They're down in that laboratory every night, late into the night. - And how far do you wanna go with this? - How far do you wanna go? - If we're caught doing this, me and the gaff are gonna be put out of the job, and you could be shipped off to an orphanage somewhere or wherever it is they ship girls who stick their noses in when they're not supposed to. - Thomas, I wanna know what my uncle does down there. I wanna see. So you're gonna come? Tonight. [dramatic music] - Tonight. [machinery clicks and whirs] [gun clicks] - This is a man, not a dog. - Thus, all the dangerous potential. Switches at 50%. [heels clack] [switches click] [machinery whirs] - Pull the crane. [crank and chain click] [chest clicks open] [tense music] [keys jingle] - Got it. [steam hisses] - Should we increase the power? - If we set it high, we'll reduce it to ashes. [keys jingle] [tense music] - Let me do it. [chain rattles] [door shuffles] - Pull it up! [dramatic music] [crank and chain click] [electricity zaps] [cloth rips] [cloth rips] [punch lands] [body thuds] [gunshot blasts] - What is it? - Get back out, quick! [Ludwig cries out] [body thuds] [soft dramatic music] [fist slams] [slow dramatic music] - What is it? Can you see anything? - No, and I don't want to. [keys jingle] Look, we'll get these keys back to Ludwig's room, and you'll get back to yours. - It was a man, a man screaming. - I don't know what it was, and I don't wanna know. [keys jingle] [dramatic music] [monster grunts] [monster cries out] Come on. Come on! [birds chirp] [heels clack] - What is it my uncle said he needed to see me about? - More questions? - Is he all right? [knock thuds] [door opens] [heels clack] Uncle Victor, are you all right? - Your uncle is has had, how shall I put it? Shock to his system. - Yes, it's really nothing. I'll be fine. We were wondering, Anna, that is, I was wondering, if you happened to hear anything last night? - Screaming, perhaps. - I did hear something, but I thought it was just a dream. - No, I'm afraid not. We just thought that you might've heard and been alarmed, so we wanted to explain. - Your uncle and I are doing some very, very important work. We are trying to find a way to cure the insane. - Cure the insane? - Yes. Last night, we had a poor lunatic from the asylum in Bellheim down in our laboratory, a subject. I'm afraid he became rather violent, but everything is fine now. - We just didn't want you to worry. - Now your uncle has to sleep. - Was it successful? - I'm sorry? - The cure. Was the man cured? - Yes! Yes, he's much better now. [footsteps shuffle] [door creaks shut] - What did you find? - I followed its trails to the lake. It must have fallen. - We must find it. [soft dramatic music] [baby coos] [footsteps shuffle] [bird caws] [baby coos] [baby laughs] [baby cries] [woman coos] [woman screams] [dramatic music] - Run, run! Go! [gunshot blasts] [gun cocks] [man grunts] [man grunts] [gun thuds to ground] [man grunts] [man gags] [man grunts] [body thuds] [dramatic music] - No madman ever looked like that. That wasn't any kind of man. That's what they're doing down there, magic, devil's magic. They conjured up that thing. - Ghost don't leave footprints. - Who says they don't. - We can follow his tracks. Maybe we'll find something. - No. I'm not gonna stick my nose in any more where it doesn't belong; it's crazy. - Well, I'm going. - I'm not. [footsteps shuffle] [rooster crows] [water trickles] [soft upbeat music] [birds chirp] [footsteps shuffle] [woodpecker pecks] [woodpecker pecks] [woodpecker pecks] [footsteps shuffle] [bird caws] - That's no ghost. [tense music] [footsteps shuffle] Who are you? [bird caws] Can you stand up? Oh my God, I'll get help. All right. All right, I'll stay. I'll help you. I promise, won't tell anybody that you're here. [objects clatter] [tray slides] [feet thud] - I'm gonna go romp in the woods. Oh, did you make me lunch? [sack rustles] [heels clack] [footsteps shuffle] [hen clucks] Thomas! Thomas, please, listen. I followed the trail. It led to the lake. - Listen up, whatever you're getting mixed up in, quit it. And if you're not gonna quit it, then leave me out of it. I don't care what you say. Some things it's just better off not knowing. - I don't believe that, and I don't think you do either. - Think what you want. [footsteps shuffle] [hen clucks] [footsteps shuffle] [footsteps shuffle] - So how are you feeling this morning? All right. Let's open your shirt. Shirt. Sorry these don't fit any better. They were largest ones in the rag bin, and I'm not much of a seamstress, I'm afraid. [bird caws] I don't understand. You're healing so quickly, and these others? It's amazing. Here's some breakfast. [woodpecker pecks] [bird caws] I wish you could talk. You know, tell me what happened to you, where you came from. Do you even remember? Can you understand me? [bird caws] I guess not. You know, I don't see why you have to be different from anybody else. I don't mind telling you that it's getting a bit lonely. It'd be nice to have a friend to talk to every once in awhile, a real friend. - Friend. - What? [slow dramatic music] - Friend. - Yes, friend, Anna. Friend. - Friend. [door opens] [footsteps shuffle] - Don't lie around sleeping all day. - Hmm? What are those? - Your uncle wanted you to have some books. Here they are. [books thud] - But these are children's books. - You are a child, but if you don't want them. - No, no, I'll take them. Thank you. - Waste of time for a proper young lady. If you give a squint, well, with your face, it'd hardly make a difference, I suppose. If you want breakfast, don't hang about. [footsteps shuffle] [upbeat music] [birds chirp] [footsteps shuffle] - For the ducks. - Of course. [tool clanks] [footsteps shuffle] [soft upbeat music] - Boy. [bird caws] - Girl. Girl. - Anna. [Anna laughs] - Man. Man. - Friend. - [laughs] All right, come on. We'll start from the beginning. Tree. Tree. [flames crackle] [footsteps shuffle] [door opens] [dramatic music] [footsteps shuffle] Somebody's been in my room! - Your room. [chuckles] I didn't know that you'd bought the castle. - Everything is all over the place. - Well, then I suppose you have to straighten it up. - Who went in my room? - Don't take that tone of voice with me, young lady. You're living in his house because of your uncle's charity. You have no rights here, no more than any other beggar. Now get back upstairs. [feet stomp] [silverware clink in distance] [footsteps shuffle] [tense music] [door opens] [door shuts] [electricity zaps] [machinery whirs] - Uncle Victor? Uncle Victor? [dramatic music] I wanna see my uncle. - By all means, come in, Fraulein Frankenstein. [footsteps shuffle] The machine, my machine, requires constant care and attention, like a child almost. - Uncle, somebody's been in my room. - Yes, it was I. - You? What gave you the right? - Your uncle gave me the right. - But why? I don't understand. - Anna, don't you? Don't you understand perfectly well? Do you know this? Do you recognize this? Where did you get it? - I found it in the woods. - You found it in the woods. Why would you say such a thing? - I don't know. - Don't you? I think you do. Talk! What do you know? - I know. - What do you know, Anna? - I know what you do down here. - What is that? - You bring the dead back to life. - How do you... - No, no, restoring life to the dead. That was only the beginning. I will tell you. - Herr Baron! - I will tell you everything. This machine, in this crucible I create life itself. Within this pit poses the pure essence of life, the fundamental energy for which all life spring. I pour it into the dead, and the dead live. We've gone beyond that. In this room, we assembled a man, put it together from pieces of the dead, assembled him like a puzzle of flesh. We loaded him into the pit and poured life into him. We created a man who had never lived before, brought a new thing into the world. - Where is it? Where is it hiding? - I don't know what you're talking about. - It's been a dream of the ages. Of all things that were born on this earth, we human beings alone know that we must die, that all we know and love must die. It's been a curse that's followed men from the beginning. But here in this place, I banish death. You of all people must understand. What of my brother, of your mother? What if we had the power to bring them back? - Do you? - Not yet, but one day, perhaps. - What about friend? That man you- - The one you know nothing about? - You said you assembled them from pieces, but what about his brain, his mind? Who was he? Why can't he remember who he was? - Who can say? Whatever memories he had, whoever he was was destroyed, erased, either by the effects of death itself or by the process of revivification. Now he's only a shell, a thing newborn in a man's body. We didn't anticipate it. No, he came out of that pit a screaming thing. - Like a newborn child. - It's a monster! We hoped that it had died, but it's still alive, isn't it? You bring it food. I've seen it. You know where it is. - You must tell us. [dramatic music] It won't hurt me. - Is it dying from its wounds? - No, they've healed. - Healed? Ludwig, just as I thought. Hit by a shotgun blast should've been instantly fatal. The life force in him is far stronger than in any other normal human being. - Then it cannot be killed by normal means. Baron, we must act. - As I seem to recall, you were the one who said we do nothing. - I saw no reason to search for a cause where things seem to become, well, this different. I've been to the village. He's been seen. Do you know he killed a man the day after he escaped? - What? Why didn't you tell me? - I thought it better not to. - I don't believe it. - Oh, you can believe it, young girl. He was seen. There aren't two like him in the world. - Anna, you have to tell us where he is. We have to recapture him. - What for? - Because he killed man. He's dangerous. - I mean, recapture him for what purpose? - To study him, to find where we went wrong. - I don't believe you. - Enough! [footsteps shuffle] [dramatic music] [door opens] You are to remain here until you tell us. In the meantime, we'll search for him. - He can't be far away. - Wait, please. He won't hurt me. Please! Don't hurt him. [soft dramatic music] [flames crackle] [knock thuds] Who's there? - Well, you've certainly got the castle in an uproar, George. - Thomas, my uncle. - He was in the woods all day with Ludwig. They came dragging back around an hour ago, not looking very happy, I can tell you. What's going on? - Thomas, you have to get me out of here. - There's no key in the lock, and Frau Herstner's still in the kitchen. - Thomas, please listen to me. I need your help. They're looking for that man we saw the other night. - Man? - I don't have time to explain. Please believe me, whatever he looks like, he is a man. My uncle and Ludwig are looking for him right now, and if they catch him, they're gonna kill him. [tense music] [wolf howls] [footsteps shuffle] - You? Monster? [footsteps shuffle] [dramatic music] Where are you? I have a message from Anna. Do you understand? Anna. She sent me here. She told me to tell you- - No! Get away from him, boy! He's a madman. Get back. [flames whoosh] Do you remember? Vile. [flames whoosh] Pain? - What are you doing? - Get out of here, boy. Back. Back to the castle! [monster grunts] [men grunt] [syringe pops into flesh] [body thuds] [body thuds] - Let's get this thing back to the castle and finish with him! [slow dramatic music] [crickets chirp] - Anna. - Thomas, did you find him? - Sorry. They must've followed me. They caught him. They've taken him down into the basement. - Thomas, you have to get me out of here. You've got to. - I'll find the key. [footsteps shuffle] [footsteps shuffle] [box opens] [keys jingle] [footsteps shuffle] - Amazing. Any of these wounds should've been instantly fatal. The injection itself could've killed at least three normal men. - There's only one sure way here, Herr Baron. Raise the pit temperature to 400 and drop it in. It'll be incinerated. No trace will remain. Herr Baron, we must hurry. - Yes. Yes, you're right. Levers up full power. [footsteps shuffle] [machinery clicks] [lock rattles] - Thomas, the sound from the basement. It's getting louder. - [Thomas] I'm trying, I'm trying. [machinery clicks and whirs] - Herr Baron, quickly, the last lever. - Friend. [slow dramatic music] - What? What? - Friend. - He speaks. - Herr Baron. - I can't do this. - What? - He spoke. - So it is a parrot. It means nothing. It must be destroyed! - I thought it was just a mindless thing, but he's not. He speaks. He's a man. - Man. - Are you insane? He's committed murder. We'd be held responsible. You're willing to risk the gallows for thing? - I'll take that chance. - I won't. I won't be responsible for such a thing. - We are responsible. His crime is ours, and I will not commit another murder. - You will not? Then stand aside and let me do what must be done. That is what you do best. [dramatic music] [Ludwig grunts] [body thuds] [body thuds] - Stay away from me! Stay away from me! [Ludwig screams] [electricity zaps] [body thuds] [flames roar] [lock clicks] - We've gotta hurry. We gotta hurry. [electricity zaps] - Friend! Uncle Victor! - Get out! - No, we'll get you out! - The machine. It will destroy itself and the castle. - Open the door. We'll save you. - Friend. - We've gotta go. We're out of time. - Go! - Come on! [footsteps shuffle] - I'm sorry, friend. I should've taken better care of you.
