And the fire was burning at the log-raft's edge where I sat and enjoyed the warmth "Sanni of the log-driver's camp", that handsome girl I suddenly called to mind. As each summer arrived, Sanni was there to make coffee for all of us Though I and the others got to feel that she came to arouse us boys. Sanni's patent-leather shoes creaked when she was dancing. And in the whirling dances did the boys' hearts throb with love. As summer came it was Sanni's aim to stir up all the boys. And every evening we'd all try to cool down our frustrations. When we boys gambled on the log-raft Sanni was first prize. Sanni herself would just laugh it off like a tune on a mouth organ Came autumn and Sanni also left and snow fell on the log-raft. And we boys remember with regret summer as a beautiful dream Where is Sanni now? Getting married down south somewhere. He'd be a lucky beggar! I also think of Sanni. She came like a swallow. TO SALORANTA That's the way to Saloranta. - It's about a kilometre. - Thanks. It's dripping, it's dripping... to the foot of the old fir tree. Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker The bigger the bucket the better. Enough warbling! Get moving. I have customers waiting. It's dripping, it's dripping to the foot of the old fir tree. - Aren't you finished yet? - Should be full now. Full, huh? Are you kidding me? Yes, I'm looking... so many people are rarely seen The musicians change so quickly as the wedding party do a well-oiled dance Uppsa daisy, cheerio! We played from morn till eve Uppsa daisy, cheerio! At our Hurmala wedding. The bridegroom carried beer in a tub with a ladle, though he didn't drink. The guests, they probably drank too much and the grannies were disgusted Uppsa daisy, cheerio! We played from morn till eve Uppsa daisy, cheerio! At our Hurmala wedding. The priest shouted out that everything was free at this Hurmala wedding. Even though Hurmala scored our girl we get others into the bargain Hello there! Welcome! Can I help you, Miss? Is this Ahola's place? - Yes...yes it is. - Yes and no! - Excuse me. - That's alright. - You can sit at our table, Miss. - At our table, if you please. What have you been getting up to, now? There's a girl, a miss, here, asking for you. What's a girl-a-miss? I'll be down when I've finished my 'pharmaceutical chores'. - Keep her company. - Shall do! Where's my litre measure? Is that so important? Just pour it in. The seller must have measure in hand. The buyer can check it with his finger. Take a log-driver for yourself, my girl Find out what being happy means! In the grip of a log-driver's arms You are as safe as can be In the grip of a log-driver's arms You are as safe as can be We are your future, we are rewarding We are cheerful too... Shhh such smooth cheeks! ...all us guys. In the grip of a log-driver's arms you are as safe as can be In the grip of a log-driver's arms you are as safe as can be That was a nice song. I'll have to write it down. Not one of the best ones. Old-fashioned, don't you think? Listen to this... Doesn't a good log-driver know everyone around? So we welcome you today, to the Hotel Hurmala! Come and learn to dance to be-bop and swing In Hurmala you can always hear the music playing... Here we only drink to joy and never sorrow. And from under the bar you'll always get yourself a shot. Come and learn to dance to be-bop and swing In Hurmala you can always hear the music playing. Log-drivers and be-bop. That's not old-fashioned. That's new-fashioned! What are you looking for, my pet? What made you come here? Who sent you? I was told that travelers could get a room at Ahola's farm. I bought Ahola's and call it Hurmala's. Now it's a cafe. We have amusements and dancing. I am Jussi Hurma. Oh dear. What can I do now? Can you suggest somewhere else where a stranger might stay? There's no other place in this village. - There has to be! - Well, of course, but none with a spare room. No, there aren't any. What you got from Ahola, you can get from Hurmala and it's a lot better. Just rent it for a year. I just need a room for a few days. - Can I see it? - You can have a look. Me and the others can make do with a hole in the wall. Miss... Thank you. Thank you so much. I only need the room for a few days. Then we don't need to talk about the rent until later on, if at all. You make room, I make room. We fit into the same space. I don't think I'll stay. What are you hesitating about? It doesn't suit me. Goodbye. Don't go now! You can have it any way you want. Any way at all. - I'll spoil you rotten. - I'm very sorry. I don't cry over spilled milk. - I blame someone else. - I can believe it. Let me take your hand and talk with you. Leave me alone. Get out of my way! Don't get me wrong. Maybe I'm nuts, but I love you. I love women. Beautiful women, most of all. And you are beautiful. Don't be afraid of Jussi Hurma. Leave me alone, or I'll call out for help! Someone's there. - I'll call him to come. - What are you doing? I'll be right back. I'll just check outside. If you'd dropped it on your toe the world wouldn't have heard it! Shhh, he's coming! So that's what you are! I've dealt with thieves before. If you accuse us, we'll accuse you. We'll see who comes off worst! Get out of here, before I really lose my temper! What's going on here? It's none of your business. Get going! - I'll handle this girl. - Let me go! No one leaves Hurmala like that as if you were running away. Get your filthy paws off her! You whippersnapper! You'll pay for this! You haven't heard the last of it! May I ask what you're looking for? Why not? I'm a cub-reporter on a magazine where the editor is horrible. We quarreled and he asked me to write an article about modern-day forestry workers. He believed I wouldn't be able to do it. We'll see to it that he eats his words. We sure will! Wait till I have a word with the lady here. - Hello there! - Hello, hello. Would you be able to put this young lady up for a few days? Oh, that's what you want! Fine, we have a spare room. Great! Miss, you can have a room here. This lady can give you full board. I have to hurry for the log-drive. See you! My dad was from the manor a rich man's child, oh so fancy. My dad was from the manor he was a rich man's fancy Now people call me sire so fine looking have I grown Now people call me sire so fine looking have I grown Giddyap, Paavo, trot on. My dad was from the manor a rich man's child, oh so fancy. My dad was from the manor he was a rich man's fancy Now people call me sire so fine looking have I grown Now people call me sire so fine looking have I grown No, no, Paavo, Paavo... Isn't the horse too old? Old? It's not even fully-grown yet. - Only 50. - 50? Yes, 50. They call these sled foals. I know, but this horse have been poorly trained. I could see that. Oh, Mr 'Ten-spot'. Paavo has probably even higher job-training. We pulled a carousel with him before. A carousel? And apart from that, both Paavo and I studied circles. Are you making fun of me? No, how would I do that, mister chief clerk? What makes you think that? And Paavo and I are friends. The same work, the same feelings and the same music. Full stop! Carry on! Carry on with what? Playing? With your work! Understand? Here, pussy-puss! Always getting your claws into everything... Let go a minute, sweetie. Good morning, Mr Deputy, sir! Good morning. Can I complain to you now, or do I have to come to the office? That depends. The thing is that I need to get a new stove. Is that the company's concern? I'm the company's meals-lady, aren't I? I take meals and coffee to the log-drivers. If you would take a look at the stove, sir, you'd see why I'm complaining. Full stop! I guess I should take a look. I'm the one to make the recommendation. My livelihood depends on that stove. When its back is cracked, it smokes like an old tugboat. The body of the stove has holes and cracks, and smokes like billy-o. Have a look, sir. It seems to be cracked. It'd be hard to cook with it. I've often had to make-do with a fire on the beach, though the log-driver boss doesn't like it. Neither do I. What can I do? They all like their coffee. No one would be happy without it. Now you've got soot on your nose from the damned thing! Don't do that... I'll do it myself! It won't cost you anything. I'll clean your nose for free. This is... Marleena, what's this all about? You're old enough not to ask! When you hug Marleena you always get a sooty nose! He was fooling with the stove, not me. Full stop! You rubbed my nose like it was a sooty coffee pot. With that rag full of germs! I'll have to find some disinfectant right away. - Disinfect it immediately! - Full stop! Why can I never understand gents? You understand us log-drivers. Nobody understands everyone. And you don't need to, thank you very much! I need to get a new stove before all the log-drivers arrive. Try to keep the new drive-boss happy till his son arrives. Good morning! Has madam got coffee ready? What am I supposed to heat it with? You can have beer, not coffee. Yeah, this looks really bad. We can try and fix the stove. Listen, you. In the meantime, go make a fire on the beach for Marleena. Should you put, should you put fire under your pot, so Just like so, just like so fire under the pot, so Should I be, should I be with my very own maid, oh Then the coffee'd be very hot hotter than the fire, so Just like so, just like so hotter than the fire, so Should he be... should he be... easy to set on fire, so Why is it you sigh between each of the verses? I wish you'd figure it out yourself. Come now! Maybe some day I will. But can you figure this out? I've neither key nor pick-lock with which to open your heart I've neither key nor pick-lock with which to open your heart I shall be able to open it though by kissing your lips so red! I shall be able to open it though by kissing your lips so red! Here's some nice firewood for you. Thanks a lot. You're as nice as a little ladybird. - Ladybird? - Yes. Do you think I look like a ladybird? No, but I couldn't think of anything else. Listen, Marleena, what's this tomfoolery about? What tomfoolery? I don't understand your riddles And you're comparing me to some small creatures with wings. Maybe I think we're like two butterflies fluttering after a rose. Butterflies? Why the heck would we be butterflies? Ask your horse. He's ashamed of you already. Who would this be, coming towards us? A new log-driver. They've been coming in all day. There'll be a gang of them coming in this evening. Howdy! Why are you boiling up coffee outside? The oven is broken and the bosses won't give me a new one. You'd think they'd know better. Now, with more than ever coming I'll need a new stove and a helper. Helper? Yes, tonight there'll be a gang from up the river arriving. Complain to the chief clerk. He's a fount of wisdom. That's right. Full stop! Where's the office? I have to register. It's the cabin at the back. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. When love comes to be aroused your mind is sensitised but to your sweetheart's window all the men are running We bid the sorrow leave us and... You open up your window, and... Who are you and what are you staring at? Don't you know you're supposed to knock? The door was open. Full stop! State your affair. I'm busy. Who are you? I'm a lo...dri... Lo-dri ! What the heck is that? Don't beat about the bush! My name is Eräs [One], so the word is absolutely necessary The log-drive boss has promised to take me on. Just now I'm drawing up the organization's systematization and rationalization. I don't know for sure in what position I'll place you... In the meantime go to Jäärä's gang. Full stop! Why do you say "full stop"? End of discussion. You understand? No time is wasted here. Discussions are kept short and concise, and work proceeds at full capacity. That's excellent. I understand now. About time! The sun shines down upon the lake and melts the ice away Then spring floods come flowing down with all our log-drivers. The Kemi River, Kymmene, Vantaa and the others To gold we turn the forests of our land Hey ho, hidey ho To gold we turn the forests of our land Every log-driver needs to know how to pull his weight. With arms full of steel and half the strength of a horse. That spear is our grapnel, our arm of law and order. Hey ho, hidey ho, our arm of law and order. Old gossipy women prattle and prattle away Rubbish and nonsense empty tittle-tattle Surely they all vie to ask after those men on the water. Rubbish and nonsense empty tittle-tattle When log-drivers reach the shore They're clutching on to their grapnel Hey ho, hidey ho They're clutching on to their grapnels The dashing log-driver is the last you'd ever call a gentleman. But all he wants to have is a maiden in his arms. Wow! So many men, all at once! And I guess you all want coffee? How shall we do it? Get yourselves in a queue, and I'll see it happens. We'll get thirsty queuing up! Don't you see I'll be working at full speed? Go and fan the fire. Fancy me having a broken stove when so many men are thirsty. Oh dear! Where am I going to get more help? Oh, I'm so sorry! The pot is empty again! Back in a flash, boys! Don't laugh! What a charming cottage on the barge. It's necessary on a log floating site. - Is she the proprietor? - Yes, and she needs a helper. A helper? That has to be me! You bring me luck. Yes, especially if you and Marleena get along. You sure drink a lot, boys. But go ahead and drink! I'm not running out of coffee. Just hang on, I'm a bit stretched without a kitchen-maid. Here's another potful! - Well, who are you? - Your kitchen-maid. If those still queuing would sing again, it'd go better. Well boys, let us log-drivers sing and dance now! We log-drivers are happy for, we're kind and diligent, it's sure Hardworking, hey, sing our praise kind and diligent, we say Sometimes when there is ice up on the swamp like this Sometime, and I sing our praise, up upon the swamp, I say Up on the swamp Now the little girls, they say have all been so sad this day Sad to be sure, sing our praise, that they were, I say Now a three-barge party there will be Three barges, we sing our praises, we There is spring up in the air, so a spring in our step is there Dance and sing our praise, dance the days away Happiness, it comes freely, yo, sadness costs you dearly, yo Costs you, sing our praises, hey! Sorrow costs you dear, I say What might the fair maid's name be, so we can carve it on our log-hooks? Just call me Sanni. - Hear that, everyone? - Her name's Sanni. Tradition requires that the name be included in the song. We'll stick to that. The one to whom Sanni first gives permission gets to carve it. Won't you give more than one permission? How can you tell? By her eyes... A log-driver knows a woman's eyes. I'll get the coffee pot. How the hell did a girl like you end up here? If it's alright, boss, we'll talk later. Boss? You think I'm the boss? Do you see me with a pot belly? It's your whole appearance. Aren't you the master of the barge? Like that, you mean? I don't quite know how to put it... when there are so many riddles that need to be solved. But maybe you can help me, Miss. Later, when I'm in less of a rush. Yes, not even the log-drivers drink coffee all the time. What a girl! On the barge a coffeehouse stands, bobbing gently in the waves and hither are drawn the log-driving boys throughout the days and nights Two young ladies serve them there, Sanni and Marleena and for them, the log-drivers sing so beautifully in their chorus. Ah, Sanni, that beauteous maid like a white water lily flower And Marleena, so round and fine, will ever be fondly remembered And the last drop is for us. And that's the best bit. Can you tell me, Miss, who you are and where you come from? I'm from the big city. Mr Eräs said you needed an assistant, I'll try, if you agree. I agree, for sure, but if you want to be paid, the drive-boss has to agree. We can discuss that in the morning. And his assistant manager will want to get into the act, no doubt, like all the others. That's what happens when you're young. It's a damned important time in a woman's life. When I was young, a lot of guys were interested. So many, there were. But I was the sort of girl that could hop across rolling logs like a little bird. Yes...that was an important time. Though no one sat down and told me that at the time. We'd best get some sleep now. Tomorrow the work starts for real. I've neither key nor pick-lock with which to open your heart I've neither key nor pick-lock with which to open your heart I shall be able to open it though, by kissing your lips so red! I shall be able to open it though by kissing your lips so red! Why do I always sing that song? Humankind, do not grow old! The laws of nature forbid it. Humankind, do not grow old! The laws of nature forbid it. Stop singing! What do you think you're doing, my man? When you're working, your mouth stays shut! All that comes out of it is breathing! How about a belch? If I see you wasting time on the job again... Hey Mister, calm down mister, mister, mister, calm down! Full stop! Take it easy in your life and your troubles will fall away Take it easy in your life and your troubles will fall away Mister, mister, forget about getting yourself worked up. Mister, don't be so jumpy ever again. Mister, don't be so jumpy That's the 11th commandment Mister, don't be so jumpy That's the 11th commandment Keep your mind balanced out Banish those small worries. Keep your mind balanced out Banish those small worries. Humankind, do not grow old! Do not grow old Do not grow old Humankind, do not grow old! Stop singing now! How is that going to go down? Full stop! And be careful! - You mustn't damage the logs. - Damage? Right! I demand precision in everything. Full stop! That guy should be thrown in. We could give him a scare on the beach. He'd wet his pants! - Hi, Sanni, the lumberjack girl. - Hi! - We have a good idea. - What's that? We'll set up a chorus ''The Singing Log-Drivers''. In minor key we sing for free, but in major we want to be paid. On the barge a coffeehouse stands bobbing gently in the waves and hither are drawn the log-driving boys throughout the days and nights Two misses serve them there Sanni and Marleena and for them, the log-drivers sing so beautifully in their chorus. Ah, Sanni, that beauteous maid like a white water lily flower And Marleena, so round and fine will ever be fondly remembered On our log-hooks is inscribed the name of the girl we fancy. Though through the ravages of time the name gets worn away. But two bonnie names so fair, Sanni and Marleena, will last for ever and ever in the memory of these boys. Ah, Sanni, that beauteous maid like a white water lily flower And Marleena, so round and fine will ever be fondly remembered! - A cold beer, Miss. - Coming up! I heard a chorus singing just now. We started up a little chorus. It's the custom around here. Customs can be changed, the same as people. Here's your beer. What did you say should be changed? N...nothing. Er... Full stop. Miss Sanni is Marleena's assistant. - Temporary assistant. - I see. Really? That's okay. Mr assistant manager, I didn't thank you for making a happy day for me. I'll even curtsy for that! What? I don't understand... ...with all the new responsibilities I have to bear. I told the men of the problem, and they're all behind me. I just told you once, and you helped. You came across. Get straight to the point! Came across about what? The stove, the oven! I just have to give you a big hug, assistant manager! One, two, three, four, five, six! Full stop! I don't like this sort of thing. This is quite impossible. Have another cold beer! At least you know how to behave! We've been praising you all morning. The new stove is great. It came by motorboat. The men installed it. But I can't... I had no idea that... Hi! - Want a cold beer? - Just matches. And you walked off the job, just to get them! You're here just drinking beer, and the others whatever they like. It seems anything goes here. Not at all! You're wrong, full stop! I'll show you. And you, get back to that nag of yours! Everyone else, back to work! Back to work! There'll be no singing or playing! Full stop! Paavo needs music to work. It's the custom. Forget old customs! And a horse has to learn to follow my system! Explain that to the horse! That's worth a tenner. A fiver will do! And you went and kissed him! It was worth it, for the stove. Got to stay on side with the bosses. I may need a new barge. The old one's getting worn out. You can get soaked fetching bottles. Don't feel bad about her. It's just diplomacy. And Metku doesn't get his feet wet! Have your feet got wet? I haven't noticed. Didn't want a better barge? Why would I want anything like that? Everyone seems ready to fulfill your wishes. - Even the chief clerk. - I doubt that! Hello there, sir! May I have a moment of your valuable time? You'll be well-rewarded! What do you mean? Who are you? Don't you recognise me? I'm on the village council. Hurmala's the name. Good morning, councilor. May I give you a copy of this best-seller that we're selling to the log-drivers? What's this book about? How to win in love! Read it first, and then read it to your girl. Everyone starts and finishes with a serenade... Full stop. I know. - Thanks for the gift. - Don't mention it. It'll be lively on the dance floor when your log-drivers turn up. We have entertainment, too. Could you come and give a speech on culture? A speech? Me? About what? Whatever you like. They'd appreciate hearing a manager giving a speech. Full stop! Certainly I'll come. When is it? Saturday evening. Very well. Goodbye. You can always rely on me. Dear citizens... Men and women... Ladies and gentlemen... That sounds better. Winning at Love Let's do some business here. Buy "Winning at Love". Winning at love? Buying one? I'll buy one. I won't. I'll borrow his. Over here! Will you buy "Winning at Love"? 20 marks. Give me the dough. I'm not paying that much for such a thin book. Look how condensed the print is. Buy it, and you won't be shy when you meet girls. What girl is that over there? Our Sanni can't go to the village. Is she coming to the dance? If we come, she's coming. Without her, you won't see us. That I can understand! You buying one? No. The beat of the cheerful polka guides those feet of mine Eeva's mamma watched the lass as if she were a shrine We will not accept a no, the dance makes all of us let go. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! Eeva smiled with her mouth so wide so everyone could their sorrows hide. All were sweating, it was mad, a mood the crazy fiddle had. But sweating never made us say whoa! The dance says that we must let go! Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! Eeva's mother in her chamber sang her hymns throughout the summer when the neighbour's boy, in good form, took her daughter off by storm. That boy bothered us, oh no! The dance makes all of us let go! Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! Delight was had by everyone, when they joined the dancing fun. Back at home the women fought, and even Eeva felt she ought. I said to Eeva, "It's our business? No!" The dance says that we must let go! Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! I told the old hag to shut her hole, so now everything's under control. You get to get away scot-free, so long as very fast you be. That boy bothered us, oh no! The dance makes all of us let go! Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! Then I told her that you have to bite, otherwise your throat will get too tight. You can try with all your might but I won't let Eeva out of sight. That boy is never shy, oh no! The dance says that we must let go! Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! ...and under my sweetheart's window... ...and my sweetheart sees the men... With the fires of love ignited Don't shake your head! Am I shaking it? But when we get to this part... ...under my sweetheart's window... That should be sung tenderly. And under my sweetheart's window Full stop! Not like a growling bear! I told you already to sing it tenderly! It's likely that the lady who we're singing for has already woken up. What happens when we've lured her to the widow? Then you won't be needed. When I give the stop sign, you slip discreetly away. Does that mean... ...sneaking away? Something like that. Now we'll start with "You happy maiden". Then we'll go. We'll make sure we get there first. Ready? Sweet and hot ignited the flame of love Eyes fixed upon the window, for her, the one above. Our gaze so hot it glazes the serenade's sweet phrases Oh wake up now, apace, and let us see your face! We adore you from the break of dawn We dream of you as logs are born. We're watching and we're standing tight here on this warm, still summer's night. You always greet us with a smile You're always happy, without guile Oh, wake up now, apace, that we might see your face. What a nice performance, boys! Let me offer you some lemonade. The love of... Stop, you fools! I thought the radio was on, but it was a chorus with the chief clerk himself! I was wondering where I was! But when I saw my new stove, I realised nothing supernatural was happening. I get so sensitive about such things here. Come on in, and I'll open some bottles of lemonade! Doesn't Sanni live here? Sanni? No, she lives in the bottom cottage. And you bums never told me that before! You've never asked! Hey! Come on! Where's the chief clerk? He snuck away. Snuck away? Well you can all sneak off! There's your lemonade. Return the empty bottles. Log-drivers' lemonade! We sang half the night and our throats are raspy. The chief clerk should have a lemonade. Otherwise we'll make him. Then he'll know a log-driver's throat is not a toy ocarina. Let's go by Hurmala. We can get more than lemonade there. Let's go and have fun. I've neither key nor pick-lock with which to open your heart I've neither key nor pick-lock with which to open your heart I shall be able to open it though by kissing your lips so red! I shall be able to open it though by kissing your lips so red! Come on! Sanni, oh Sanni... did you not hear from under the window, my song? Sanni, oh Sanni... don't you know that my longing never ends? Only for you, my dearest girl, shall this song be sung. Oh, I wish so much that my serenade shall manage to entreat you. That was a beautiful song, thank you. Here, you can have a flower each. Thank you, thank you. I'll never forget this. So, goodnight now, and thanks again. Goodnight! Open the door! We have a delivery. We have your lemonade! And you have to drink it! Lemonade for whoever... Open the door before we break it down! Can't he hear? Hey, boys, just let me... What's going on here? - This is just lemonade. - That's right. - We were just joking. - It didn't look like that. Well, give me an explanation! We were gong to drink lemonade with 'Mr Tenner'. We earned it together with him. Everything's all right. Open the door. We'll question these guys in the morning. Now go to bed! I'll have a word with the chief clerk. That's best, I guess. Hey, Eräs, come on in! That's never gonna work... I was just going to go ask those drunks what they were on about. They wanted to bring you some lemonade. - Me? - Yes. - Lemonade. - That's correct. Why would I be given lemonade in the middle of the night? That's what I would also like to know. You? Who are you, to be acting like a policeman? I'll investigate this myself. Full stop! That seems to be a tugboat with a barge in tow. What barge? You must know about it. A houseboat of some sort. Could something like that arrive without you knowing about it? The skipper wants to move Marleena's things to the new houseboat, right away. He wants to take the old one away with him tonight. We'll give Marleena a hand. Lucky girl! First a new stove, and now a new cabin. We won't wake her up. We'll carry her sleeping to her new cabin, and then take her things. It'll be a scream when she wakes up! Oh boy, oh boy! This I want to see! - She'll be totally mystified! - Shhh. Get going! She's left her key in the door, as usual. I don't have any key. Shhh... Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Is that you? Let me bite your ear. Yes, that's you! Take me to my cabin! Where am I? Tell me, right now! You're in your very own cabin. This is not my place! Surely you can see that? I understand...I understand. I say, Marleena, you're getting so warm now. Don't start getting ideas! I have to figure out if I'm crazy or not. Is this mine? And this? And all this? Answer me! And stop staring! Of course they are. Whose else would they be? You've lived here for many years. Many years? Don't you see? Or is it all as it should be? Exactly as it should be. No, it is not! I feel dizzy... My head's spinning! I can't be sure of anything, anymore. I'm not myself any longer. Now I believe that I'm myself! Yes, when you got a new... If you know anything about it, tell me right now! It's a riddle. That's what you always say. I'll show you a riddle, you damned sailor-man. I'll explain it to you now. I don't want to hear it! I'll figure it out myself. But where's my pig? Ah, Sanni, that beauteous maid like a white water lily flower And Marleena, so round and fine will ever be fondly remembered On our log-hooks is inscribed the name of the girl we fancy. Though through the ravages of time the name gets worn away. But two bonnie names so fair, Sanni and Marleena, will last for ever and ever in the memory of these boys. Good morning! Why so glum? Neither playing music nor stacking wood. I don't feel like it. The world is upside down. Can I help? All women can go to blazes. Is everything a woman's fault? Who else's? She goes and ruins a nice joke that should have ended in a cuddle. So that's why you're unhappy? The same things make us laugh and cry. I tried to draw circles, but they became squares. That's so sad... but can nobody help you? Well, why not? If someone could explain to Marleena that in all honesty I was really just trying to make her happy. Also tell her that there should be no riddles between two upright people. But no one's going to say that. I could tell her, for you. But you said I could go to blazes. That didn't include you. Alright! Here's some sugar for Paavo. I'll tell Marleena that your intentions were completely honourable. Damn-well honourable! And no more riddles! Citizens! Log-drivers... Fellow villagers... Fellow citizens! Log-drivers... Villagers. As the theme of my speech today, I have chosen Community Spirit. Hitherto the subject has been seldom raised hereabouts... ...seldom raised. Seeing as Finland's summer is so extremely short... Come in! Hello! How do the girls like their new cabin? Wonderful! Now I can move here. But we don't know who we should thank, though Marleena is not in much of a thanking mood. Was your smokey old shack better? It had a hole in the wall behind my pillow. The blessing of my life is now sailing down the river. I have no thanks for anybody. Were your savings in a gap in the wall? What else would I mean by the blessing of my life? You should have kept the money in the bank. There are things in life you don't yet understand at your age. Inflation chews away at every mark in the bank but not in a hole in the wall behind my pillow. The blessing of my life is now sailing down the river. That's what the men did. Don't worry, we'll sort it out. That old barge isn't going to sink. But it can catch fire, or hit a rock in a storm. What do you want? Do you have any 'Working Man' cigarettes? Do I? That's a funny one for a log-driver to ask about 'Working Man', as if I only had 'Gentleman' cigarettes. For such a stupid question, you can pay double. Thanks! Hey, wait! There's a dance this evening. Are you going? Sure. Everyone's asked me. They say they won't go, if I don't. Kind of silly. - Pity I can't go. - Why not? I've important things to do here. Some bastard has marked our logs with his own stamp. How is that possible? He has a stamping iron that is easy to stamp over our stamp with. - I must find him. - Isn't that dangerous? I suspect Hurma-Jussi. The villagers say that. I'll do a search of his house. Illegal, but it's the only way. Don't do that. Because... Sanni... Sanni... May I? I mean, I never get a chance to tell you... Why, after all? Sanni... I love you. I love you. Darling... Come and help me! Metku has gone crazy! The blessing of my life has gone, and now the love of my life. The most miserable day of my life! Every day is darker with storm clouds! What are you talking about? The sun is shining on a beautiful day. But when Metku has gone crazy, it feels like a thunderclap and the world goes dark. Where is Metku? Metku is shining Paavo's hooves with shoe polish. What ever are you doing? What the chief clerk asked for, sir. I'm not allowed to sing or play, but be busy with something. Hell and damnation! But why this? He's making a speech this evening while on horseback like a saddle horse at the festivities. Paavo's tail also had to be clipped. But then I asked him was he going to shoo away the flies from Paavo's rear end himself? Hell and damnation to his yakking! Tonight we'll see how the guys go with the fancy dancing. I'll do the polka. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-bo, our music shakes the fir-trees so! Listen, new boy... I'll rustle you up a chick tonight. Do you want brunette, blond or redhead? Thanks all the same, but I have to work overtime. Finland's summer is short. Therefore we must concentrate our log-driving activities to certain significant months. Now I have arrived at the crux of the matter. We shall now treat in greater detail what cooperation means to us. Cooperation does not mean that two men, for example, drive one log together but that one man drives one log and... Time for some medication. My throat's getting dry. Get as much as you can. Sure! Now we come to the third subject, which basically involves the nurturing impact of cooperation on the individual man together with the community as a whole. Did you bring your mouth organ? Why do you ask? See how Paavo's knees are bending from fatigue? Play something for him! When we at work get used to being a link in the chain That's cooperation in action! Hurmala weddings are always great fun For the first time in ages you meet everyone As the music speeds, the partners swap as they dance and swing and jump and hop. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo From morn till eve we play for you Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo A Hurmala wedding is fun for you The bridegroom brought the beer for all but didn't drink a drop at all. The wedding guest men all drank too much and the grannies complained, as they do, at such. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo From morn till eve we play for you. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo A Hurmala wedding is fun for you Generosity to all, was the clergyman's call at this Hurmala wedding ball. Though we've lost a girl to this chap to be sure we'll find some more to unwrap. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo From morn till eve we play for you Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo A Hurmala wedding is fun for you It was about when midnight came that someone started the hitting game. People used lamps to hit their mark that soon left the rest of us in the dark. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo From morn till eve we play for you Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo a Hurmala wedding is fun for you Another lamp was found, for lighting's sake and the fighting went on until day's break. When someone yelled out... Hey there, Haken! ...the fighting stopped, and photos were taken. Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo From morn till eve we play for you Hey-diddle-diddle-fiddly-boo A Hurmala wedding is fun for you! Now us boys'll sing a little song. Listen to this. Hey boys, come and sing! Sanni the forest nymph's lacquered shoes were squeaking on the dance floor The hearts of the boys, in that swirling dance Now we're stuck. One of them was in your house, with the stamping iron in his hand. I didn't jump on him, as I thought you should know first. Don't worry. I've got the answer. The girl is our security. We'll take the girl to Noki-Juosu. Few people know the way there. Goodnight now, Paavo. The chief clerk will probably get mad at us tomorrow. But we'll console each other. - What do you want? - Hurma-Jussi has abducted Sanni. I found out they're on their way to till Noki-Jousu. Come help us and quick! It's falling, falling to the base of the fir tree... Drinking, boozing, saps your mind... Yeah! It's falling, falling... Get in there! Damn it, Juosu, we're almost caught. But the girl will make it easy. She's our security. So how are you caught? Eräs is a devil. Things might get rough. Don't say anything if he comes after us. 'After us'? Why should that be? Let's run down to the beach and row away. If I finish up in the clink, so will you. I don't want to. I'm an old man. I've got bad legs. But we can fight and can negotiate if necessary, and no one will know what happened here. They're on the shore already. That's just Metku and Eräs and that damned broad. We'll hide the girl, least they take her. - Open the trapdoor! - I'll not stick anyone down there! It's hardly Hades, and it smells fine. Get down before I throttle you with your scarf! Metku, keep a lookout outside. Open up! Otherwise we'll force our way in. If you open voluntarily, it will be easier on you. You're not coming in, but we can negotiate through the window. Negotiate? What on earth is there to negotiate? If you get the girl, promise you won't tell what you saw in that room. So that's it. But I don't do business with criminals. I'm taking both Sanni and you. You'd better think again! The girl gets hurt if you don't cooperate. I don't go easy on people! No, I believe you. Metku, Metku, I'm here! I'll agree if Sanni gets to decide whether you should be charged with abduction. That won't do. Then we'll tighten the screws a bit. Don't worry, Metku and Sanni are down in the cellar. That's a lie! Who's that coming? Now we'll get him to the sheriff but bring him round first. - You mean that? - Yes! And do it now! That was quite a fight! Swing him properly, now! Now there are no riddles between us. Everything's clear now, till the end of time. A bit more than that, even. And still more again... My shaggy dog! And love that burns late never burns out. This feels like heaven! Don't kid me! That'll never break. Kissy-kiss! Why are you closing those sweet eyes? Are you enjoying our kissing? As soon as you kiss me all sorrow's forgotten- and so my eyes close with a kiss. Must you wipe your nose first? I can't kiss with people watching. Why? Who's watching? You two can go to blazes! I'm not selling beer at the moment. The tugboat captain is looking for Vuoristo, the new log-driving boss. Hello. Looking in my cabin? That's silly. No bosses here. Just the two of us, my fiance and I. But I saw him on the deck as I passed by. You did? Do you have to sneeze when others' emotions are at their hottest? Wait till we're married... You won't sneeze anymore! Here's the package you called about. Thanks, Captain. I'm sure Marleena will offer coffee when she gets back the blessing of her life! Heavens! How happy can I be? Listen, Metku... now we can get a cabin for ourselves. It really would be best for a real man to attend to business affairs himself. Well, of course! All the best to you both! Thanks so much! Excuse me, sir, may I say goodbye? I feel that I have failed in this business and I was thinking I should do better by continuing my studies. Full stop! Rubbish! I need a good chief clerk. You'll see we leave in autumn and go downstream but we'll be back. You're very kind, but I... Full stop! You see, I had to come here incognito because that way I could get to know Hurmala a little better. I see, in that case... Full stop! Sanni the forest nymph's shiny shoes were squeaking on the dance floor The hearts of the boys in the whirling dance were throbbing hard with love When summer came, it was Sanni's joy to arouse all of us boys. And in the evenings, we all tried to cool down these hot feelings On the barge a coffeehouse stands bobbing gently in the waves and hither are drawn the log-driving boys throughout the days and nights Two young ladies serve them there, Sanni and Marleena, and for them, the log-drivers sing so beautifully in their chorus. Ah, Sanni, that beauteous maid like a white water lily flower And Marleena, so round and fine, will ever be fondly remembered Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
