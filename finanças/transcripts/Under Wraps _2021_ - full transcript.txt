[heavy footsteps] Okay, Ben. Your parents wanted you in bed by ten. No way. I'm not going to bed. I saw a monster outside my window last night. Aren't you a little old to believe in monsters? It was big and ugly, and it had warts all over its face. [monster grumbling] You've been watching too many scary movies. Whatever. I'm still not going to bed. [sighs] All right. I will prove to you that there are no monsters in your room. [monster growling] -I'm not going in there. -[girl sighs] [girl] Ben, there's nothing in here. Well, there's nothing over here. There's nothing under the bed. Looks like the monster took the night off. [gasps] -Molly? -[objects crashing] -[monster growls] -[furniture thuds] [Ben screams] -[monster roars] -[Ben gasps] [monster roaring] [Ben] Help! [monster growling] -[boy screams, pants] -[audience screams, laughs] [monster roaring] Oh, he's history now! So am I. I'm outta here. [monster growling continues] Where are you going? -[monster roars] -[Ben screams] -[people on street chattering] -[siren wails] -[sighs] -[man] Ticket-holders. -If you don't mind lining up behind here. -[pants] -[man continues indistinctly] -[inhales deeply] Thanks a lot, Gilbert. Now I have to go back again to see how it ends. How can you stand movies like that? Getting scared is what makes horror movies fun. It's not fun for me. [boy] Come on, Gil. Halloween's on Sunday. How are you gonna enjoy it if you don't like being scared? Marsh, I don't need to be scared to enjoy it. The Halloween carnival isn't scary. That's because you never do the haunted houses. And last year, you spent the entire night just dumping money on that stupid ring-toss game. -I was tryna win the purple-eyed panda. -Seriously. Why are you so obsessed with that purple-eyed panda anyway? [sighs] Okay. Five years ago, I won one while we were on vacation, but it wouldn't fit in the car so we had to leave it behind. It was the biggest tragedy of my childhood. But this year… that purple-eyed panda will be mine at last. [rock music playing] And you think I'm weird for liking horror movies? Come on. I need to pick up some stuff for my Warthead costume. Even the thought of you dressed as that gives me the creeps. [groans] Come on. [monster costume screams] Hello? Buzzy? Marshall and Gilbert. Hello? Buzzy? Hope this isn't too scary for you. Give me a break. This stuff is so fake. -[muffled roar] -[Gilbert screams] -[muffled laugh] -[laughs] -[sighs] -Very funny, Buzzy. [Buzzy muffled] You didn't think it was scary? -Yes! -No. I saw your eyes blink. I was testing it for the haunted house I'm running at the Halloween carnival. [chuckles] And if they react anything like you did, it'll be awesome! [squeals] -Thanks for the preview. -So, what can I do you for? I need green slime for my Warthead costume. Lots of it. You got it. Did you see the new Warthead movie? I've already gone six times. How epic was that ending? Uh, no spoilers. I missed the ending. Someone had to leave early. Hey! It was really scary. -Isn't that the point? -Don't get him started. -How long have we been friends? -I don't know, like, forever. -And it's my duty… -[inhales deeply] …as your best friend of forever, to help you out. Help me out with what? Your fears of, well… pretty much everything. I'm not afraid of everything. -[screeches] -[gasps] -[owl hoots] -[groans] Whatever. You're missing out is all. Why do you care? [stammers] Because the world is awesome. I want you to experience all of it. I don't want you to get so scared that your world shrinks down. -We're big-world people, Gil. -Okay, yeah, big-world people. Uh, that's right. Not afraid of anything. That's why you're going to play ding-dong ditch on Mr. Kubot across the street. -Yeah. -Yeah. Wait, what? No! [scoffs] Come on, Gil. Face your fears. That guy is seriously creepy. Rumor is, he's a serial killer. That's why everybody calls him Killbot. What's the worst that could happen? With a nickname like Killbot, I don't wanna find out. -[sighs] -[grunts] Gil? [crows croaking] Uh-uh. No way. Come on. All you have to do is go up, ring the doorbell, then run. -Easy. -Then you do it. I can't face your fears. Only you can. -I don't know. -Trust me. You need this. [gate creaking] Now go. [sighs] Why do I let him talk me into these things? [sighs] [grunts] [whispering] Go. You got this. [sighs] [groans] -[Kubot] What do you want? -[screams] -[inhales sharply] -[Gilbert stammers] Uh, w-would you like to buy a ticket to the M-Morse-- Morse Park Middle School Halloween Carnival? -[growls] -[Gilbert chuckles] There's a spooky haunted house there, and I'm sure you'd fit right in. -Get off my porch! -[Gilbert screams] [screams] Help! -Go! Go! -[screaming] Come on! Go, go, go, go! -[Gilbert panting] -[Marshall] Run! Run! -Get down! Get down! Get down! -[groans] [growls] [Marshall panting] [both yelp] [sighing] See? That wasn't so bad, was it? Yes, it was worse! I'll have nightmares for the next year! -And then after that, you'll be better. -Can't wait! Anyway, wanna come over for dinner? [sighs] I can't. I have dinner with my mom and her annoying boyfriend, Ted. Hmm. Now who needs to overcome their fears? The only thing I'm afraid of is being bored to death. -Good night, Marsh. -Later. [Ted] So, Marshall, how long have you been into scary movies? Uh, a few years. You should see his room. It is practically a museum of macabre. [chuckles] -Maybe you could show me after dinner. -I have a lot of homework. If you love horror stuff, you must love Halloween. I don't know, maybe we could carve up some jack-o'-lanterns. [mom] Oh, that's a great idea. That's little kid stuff. Besides, I have a lot of homework. May I be excused? Okay, but I just-- -[footsteps departing] -[sighs] [chuckles] Don't worry. Sometimes kids just need time to adjust. I, uh-- I'll be right back. [panting] [sighs] [knocking on door] Marshall… Ted is a really, really nice man. He makes me happy. And I think you'd like him if you gave him a chance. It's too soon. Your dad and I have been divorced for five years. I need to move on with my life. We both do. Why? I-- I mean, we're doing just fine on our own. My relationship with Ted won't change anything between us. I will still love you more than anyone else in the whole world. You know that, right? I guess. I need you to keep an open mind about this. Please? [Gilbert on radio] Marshall. Are you there? Over. What is it, Gilbert? -Over. -Check out what's up at Kubot's. So? They're moving stuff. [Gilbert on radio] What is that thing? I don't know, some furniture. My mom said he's an antique importer. What antique is shaped like a dead body? Let's see. Could be an iron maiden to torment his victims, or an ancient alien robot. Or, and I'm just spit-balling here, it's a big, weird, old statue for his big, weird, old house. Okay. But I think he's up to something. Something scary. -Whatever, Gil. Over and out. -[walkie-talkie beeps] Hmm. -[dogs barking] -[birds chirping] [students chattering] Okay, now, students, we're not just here to eat gift shop astronaut ice cream. We're here for Egyptian history class, and this will be on the test. [students groan] Music to my ears. We're going by the buddy system while we're here today, so pick a buddy. Two by two, come on. Uh, Miss Pratt, there's no one left to buddy with. Oh, um… Gilbert and Marshall, uh, Amy will be with you two. Go on. I'm gonna go find our docent. Wait here and please behave yourselves. So, you're the new girl, right? I'm Amy. I moved from Rockport with my dad and my Step-Dave over the summer. Wait. What? My two dads split up a few years ago. Pop lives back in Rockport and Dad married Step-Dave. Anyway, hi. -Hi. -Hey. [chuckles] So, um, how-- How do you-- -How do you like it here? -I hate it. This town is boring and my friends are all back in Rockport. How exciting do you need it to be? I'm gonna be an investigative journalist. To do that, I need to find stories. To do that, I need to be someplace where stories happen. And this is not it. Well, who knows? This place could surprise you. Anything's possible, but I doubt it. Dad and Step-Dave said if I don't like it, I can go live with Pop in Rockport. So, next summer, I am outta here. Dracula, huh? I know everyone's batty about Lugosi. I much prefer Christopher Lee. I mean, Horror of Dracula? Lugosi didn't even have fangs. Great. Another one. -Have you seen the new Warthead? -Of course! That ending was gore-tastic. -Especially-- -Oh, no spoilers! I missed the ending. -You didn't stay for the ending? -'Cause of me. I had to… nope out. -Gotcha. -[Marshall] Anybody want Skadoodles? -I do. -Give it back. Permission slip said no snacks. I'm helping you hide the evidence. That's Todd. In third grade, Marshall accidentally knocked him over into his own birthday cake. [laughs] It was hilarious. -I see, uh… -No, no. Excuse me for a moment. Hi, I'm Amy. You're Todd, right? Yep. I see you've decided to hang out with me instead of those two weirdos. Smart. Thanks, Todd. Anyway, I just wanted to see if you were feeling okay. -Why wouldn't I? -Maltitol. -Mult-- -Oh. I guess you didn't see the news reports. It's a sugar substitute, but it has its side effects. What? If you haven't built up a tolerance to it… I hope your parents are stocked up on toilet paper. You'll be… busy. How busy? It only takes a few seconds before… [whispering] …boom. [gulps, shudders] Excuse me! I need to find a bathroom. Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom. [Marshall laughs] Okay, that was amazing. Your candy is safe from now on. [students chattering] Welcome to the Secrets of the Egyptian Tomb exhibit. Right this way. This solid stone container is something the ancient Egyptians used to place the dead in. Does anyone know what it's called? A sarcophagus? Excellent. A sarcophagus is a protective shell. Inside, it holds a wooden coffin with the mummy. Is there a real mummy in there? [sighing] No. I'm afraid not… because it's right over here. [Marshall] [laughing] Way cool. As you can see, this coffin has a lot of bling. Based on that, archaeologists deduce that she was a princess from 2000 BC during the 12th Dynasty. Any questions so far? Don't they come alive at night and eat people's brains? -[students laugh] -[Docent] Only in horror movies. And thankfully… [exclaims] …we're not in one. -[chuckles] -[Amy] I noticed there are two sarcophagi and two platforms, but only one mummy. Shouldn't there be another mummy? You are very observant. There was a second mummy in the tomb, believed to be a high priest. They were in love. But their families were bitter rivals. So, their attendants conspired to entomb them together, so they could be with each other in death. [students] Whoa. So romantic in a very emo-goth kind of way. Isn't it? Sadly, it didn't last. In 1925 the tomb was raided, and they were whisked away to different museums. Our exhibit was all set to reunite them for the first time in almost a century. But the high priest's mummy mysteriously disappeared on its way here. So it was stolen? Sadly, yes. So, if any of you come across a mummy, please call our mummy hotline. [students chuckle] Now before we move on, we have a full-sized reproduction of an Egyptian coffin if anyone would like to see what it's like to be in one. -Picture time! -Yeah! -Hey, Amy! Come on! -Yeah, come on! Uh, no thanks. I'll wait my turn. Say, "Mummy." Mummy! -[camera shutter clicking] -[school bell ringing] [woman over PA] Attention, the bake sale tomorrow will start at 9:00 a.m… [continues indistinct] I can't figure her out. I mean she seems cool, but why is she so down on Walgrove? This is an awesome town. Wouldn't be so awesome if your friends were somewhere else. I mean, that's gotta stink. Yeah. You're right. Uh, hey, uh, maybe we should see if she wants to, you know, hang out with us sometime. Thanks. I'd love to. Hi. For your future reference you two need to work on your "quiet voices." Hmm. So, how did you know what an esophagus was? Sarcophagus. Like I said, I'm gonna be an investigative reporter. I gotta know a little about a lot. You ought to investigate our neighbor. Why? What's so special about him? Go ahead. Tell her what we saw last night. -It was nothing. -Are you kidding me? Our neighbor was moving a weird, giant body in a creepy burlap sack into his house in the middle of the night. How weird and how giant? Pretty giant. Reasonably weird. And you're sure it was body-shaped? You saw it too, right? I mean, yes, i-i-it was, but-- There's only so many things shaped like a body. A body being at the top of that list. Giant, body-shaped. And did it look like it was all floppy or was it-- Stiff as a board. -Anthropoid coffin. -Anthro what now? A coffin shaped like the person inside. Like at the museum. -Which means? -Which means, I think you found the stolen mummy, and I found my story. And you're gonna take me there. Let's go! Okay. This place has crime scene written all over it. [Marshall] I don't think beheading a lawn gnome counts as a crime. We need to get a look at-- Whatever you saw. No. Kubot is scary enough from a distance. Yeah. Just because it looked like an anthropod-- -Anthropoid. -Whatever. Doesn't mean he stole the mummy. Come on. You guys scared? -You gotta face your fears. -Where have I heard that before? I've gotta be home for dinner. I'll meet you here at eight. We'll sneak over and look through the windows. -Bring a flashlight. Got it? -This is not a good-- -Good. -I don't think we should do this. What just happened? I don't know. But she is really good at talking people into stuff. Tell me about it. Maybe we should do this another time. Yeah, like the daytime. Or we can do it tonight. Good idea. Come on. [dog barks] [Gilbert] Are you sure he's not home? [Marshall] Yes. His car's not here and the lights are out. Go around back. [Amy] Look at all this stuff here. This place is like a million different grandma attics compressed into one house. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? If he has the coffin, I have a hunch it'll be here. And I have a hunch this is a bad idea. Let's go. [window creaking] Okay. Let's get this over with. [Marshall] No. This is as far as I'm going. You two run around in the dark and get caught. I'm staying here. [sighs] Come on, Marshall. I gotta stop letting people talk me into stuff. -[rustling] -Who's there? [creaking] -[yelps] -[rustling] Hello? [Amy] I-It could be anywhere. What is all this stuff? [animal squealing] [pants] Oh. [panting] [gasps] Oh! Oh, no! The dead body! [gasps] Amy was right. Hmm. I wonder what's inside. [grunts] [sighs] This thing is heavy. [screams] Oh, no! Ugh. This thing is hideous. Oh, what's that? It's shiny. [screams] [grunts, pants, screams] [panting continues] [screams] Mu-mu-mummy! [mummy crackling, popping] M-Mummy, mummy, uh, live mummy! I found the stolen mummy! -I knew it! -How do you know it's the stolen one? How many mummies are in this town? -Okay, show us. -Come on! Live mummy! What? It was right here a minute ago. Well, then I guess it just got up and walked away. Okay, c-can we get out of here-- [distant groaning] Uh, please tell me that was one of your stomachs. -No. -[distant growling] [breathing heavily] [growling continues] [Gilbert] What's that? -What is that? -[door creaks] Where is that sound coming from? [Amy] Look, there! -[children gasp] -[grunts] [Gilbert] Ah! [roars] -Go! Time to go now! -[screams] -[children scream] -[roaring continues] -[Marshall] Hurry up! -[screaming continues] -[Gilbert] Come on! -[Amy] Oh, my God! -[Amy] Come on! -[children screaming] [mummy groaning] -[screaming continues] -[Marshall] Close the door! [groaning continues] [Gilbert] Come on! What do we do? Whoa! Whoa! We gotta hide! -[Amy] In here. -[Gilbert] Come on! [groaning continues] -[Amy] Door, door! -Door! -It's locked. -[mummy roars] Quick, turn your flashlights off. [footsteps approaching] [groaning] [furniture clattering] No, no, no! Oh, oh. We're trapped. Uh, what are we gonna do? -[mummy roaring, groaning] -What is going on? [screams] -[doll laughs] -Quiet! What's happening? I think it left. Come on. -[mummy grunting] -[children screaming] -No, no, no, no! -Please. -[Marshall] Please. -[Gilbert] Please! [mummy grunts] -[mummy grunts] -I think it wants to give you your flashlight back. -He can keep it. -Take it. You don't want to offend him. [mummy grunting] Thank you? [grunting continues] Mummies are supposed to be dead. How come he's moving? He came back to life when you opened his esophagus. Sarcophagus! And it wasn't a sarcophagus, it was a coffin. The princess' coffin at the museum was open, and unless she's sleepy, she didn't come back to life. Let's deal with this on a mummy-by-mummy basis. -I wouldn't! -Are you crazy? It could bite. I'm sure he doesn't mean us harm. He's probably confused. [Gilbert] It's a live mummy. You'd be that way too if someone woke you up from a 4,000-year nap. -[mummy moans] -Just be careful. Hey there. It's okay. Nice mummy. [mummy groaning] Hey. It must be so weird for him. -[mummy groans] -He's kind of like a time traveler. [moans] -[car approaching] -[Marshall, mummy gasp] No, he's back! We gotta get out of here, now! -What about the mummy? -What about him? He's not our problem. Kubot is. Come on! -I'm sorry. -[groaning] [door shuts] Whoa. What happened? Looks like you've been hit. No. No, no! [all panting] Oh. -Oh, oh, that was close. -Too close. -The mummy. -It's gone. [Kubot] Oh, that's what they were after. Oh, whoever did this is gonna pay. If my dad would let me get a phone, I could've gotten pictures. Getting pictures would be the last thing on my mind. We're talking life after death. This could've been the story of the century. I say we go back to our homes and forget we ever saw what we saw. -[gasps] -[groaning] -Shoo! -Shoo! Go away! [children] Go away! Go! -No. Go! -Turn around. -[Amy] Turn around. -[Marshall] Go! -No, no, no! -Go away! -No, wait! No, no, no! -Stop! -[grunts] -Please, stay. Stay. [whimpers] We can't let him go back to Kubot's. What are we supposed to do with this? Someone needs to put him up for the night. Why are you looking at me? -Your house is here. -And Gilbert's is there! But yours is closer. I can't even take care of a goldfish, much less a mummy. You want me to take a live dead mummy into my house with my mom home? -You're the one who loves monsters. -Not real ones! You need to put him up for the night. -Got to get home. School night. See ya! -Me too. Later. -Wait! Wait! -[mummy groaning] Wait! You can't just leave me here with this thing. [groans] -[groaning, creaking from television] -[Diane laughs] Shh. [groaning on television continues] [groans] [groaning continues] -[grunts] -[Diane] Marshall? -Hey, Marshall. -Hey. [Diane] You're out late for a school night. [Marshall] Uh, lost track of time, sorry. [grunts] -[coughs] -[grunts] Well, come join us. This is one of Ted's favorite movies. -It's mummy-rific. -[laughs] No, thanks. I've had my fill of mummies for one day. Well, have you had anything to eat? We have pizza. Thanks, I-I'll get some in a minute. Okay. -[mummy groaning] -[laughs] -So good. -I know. [grunting] -[screams] -No! Geez, it's not real. See? Fake. This is Warthead. Greatest monster of all time. Well, greatest fictional monster anyway. No, my comics! -[off-key playing] -Ooh! No, don't break that. No, you can't eat that. Maybe you guys are related. [groaning continues] Ooh, uh, no! Okay, that's enough wrecking my room for tonight. [knock on door] -Marshall? -[mummy groans] -Uh, h-hey. -Thought I'd save you a trip. We ordered extra pepperoni and hot sauce. -Just the way you like it. -Thank you. Uh, you're so considerate. In fact you're the most considerate of all moms that I know. Anywhere. Ever! Mm-hmm. Why are you being so nice? -Did you break the washing machine again? -Mom, that was once, when I was five. All right. Anyways, I have a lot of homework, so I'd better be getting to that. Thank you. [Diane sniffs] What is that smell? It's probably just my gym socks. I haven't changed them in a while. Well, wash them. Please. [sniffs] It smells like they haven't been washed in a thousand years. Ugh. [sighs] Oh. [grunts] Ugh! She's right. You are a little whiffy. [grunts] Hope you like Ocean Breeze. [growls] [growls] Mmm. Here. It's pizza. -You eat it. -[groaning] [grunts] Hmm? [grunts] Hmm. Bet you didn't have that in ancient Egypt. Oh, wait, uh, wait! I almost forgot the best part, hot sauce. Hmm. [groaning] [screams] -Uh, too hot? -[screaming continues] Holy cow! If you weren't already dead, that would kill you! [belches] Ew! Ew. [grunting] Wow. The only other guy that I knew that liked hot sauce as much as you was my grandpa. -Hmm? -Harold. -Hmm. -Uh, maybe I could call you Harold. I have to call you something. Huh? How about it, Harold? Hmm. -Okay. Marshall. -[grunts] -Me, Marshall. -[grunts] Harold. You, Harold. Me, Marshall. -[grunts] Mar-- -You, Harold. [grunting] Harold. Marshall. -Mm-hmm. -[grunting] Harold. Marshall. Harold. Close enough. This should be more comfortable than that old coffin. [grunting] Hey. Time to go to sleep. -Mmm? -You know, sleep. [grunts] Good night, Harold. [Harold snores softly] [Harold snores loudly] ["One Night" playing] ♪ Future's on the line ♪ ♪ So let's go back in time ♪ ♪ We could fix the past And make it right ♪ Teri, turn off music. [Teri through speaker] Turning off music. Marshall! We have to get to the pharmacy early today. Don't be late for school. I won't, Mom. Have a good day. -[grunting] -Okay, Harold. I have to go to school. You can't come. -Got it? -[grunting continues] And please try not to break anything. No, you have to stay in my room. Don't worry. Be right back after school. [grunts] -Marshall, you survived. -Yeah. I was worried maybe the mummy ate your brains like Todd said. Nah. He's actually pretty cool once you get used to him. Oh, and I named him Harold. Harold? Harold, hmm. I like it. But realistically, I can't keep him in my house forever. Sooner or later my mom will find him. We should return him to the museum. Museums are for dead mummies, not live ones. You didn't happen to find my inhaler at your house, did you? -No. Why? -I lost it, and if my mom finds out, she'll kill me. [grunting] [screams] [grunting] Huh? [yelps, laughs] [roars] [grunts] [grunting] Huh? [grunting continues] [whimpers] [whimpering continues] -[grunts] -[cracking] [grunting continues] [laughs] [roars] And to complete our section on ancient Egypt, you are all going to team up for a creative project. [students groan] It can be anything you dream up. From writing a story in hieroglyphics, to creating an outfit for a pharaoh, to sculpting a sphinx. Can I just bring in my parents' Egyptian cotton sheets? Looking for more imagination than that. How about making a movie? Now that's imaginative. Then Gilbert, Amy and I are gonna make a movie together. -We are? -Sounds good to me. -To review our Egyptian-- -[whispering] Guys, we're going to make a mummy movie with a real mummy. Hmm. [grunts] [yelps] [grunting continues] [bubbling] [squirts] [grunting] [grunting] Mmm. [grunting] Nom, nom. [grunting] Nom. -[screams] -Congratulations to the big winners. And now the weather with Terry Taylor. Terry? -[Teri] Yes. How can Teri help you? -Right now… [roars] [Teri] I didn't catch that. Please try again. [Terry] Highs today are below average-- [Teri] You want to order thirteen bags of birdseed. Is that correct? [roars] Oh, you want to order fourteen bags of birdseed. I can do that. [grunts] [grunting continues] [groaning] [grunts] Huh? -[screams] -[vacuuming] [grunting, whimpering] [yelping] [screaming] [roars] [vacuuming continues] [screams] [screams] [door shuts] [grunting continues] [yelps] [grunting] [Miss Pratt] Your final exam will be this Friday. Okay, little monsters, have an awesome weekend and a great Halloween, and I'll probably see you at the Halloween carnival. But unless you want to be really frightened, don't forget… [creepy voice] …your assignments are due on Wednesday. [evil laughs] -[bell rings] -Finally! So, um, get, get those into me, please. -No, Marsh. Enough horror movies. -Why? -The newest Warthead is better. -I'm not trying to get scared again. We-- Oh no! [gasps] [all] Harold! Harold! Harold! -[grunting] -[woman] Yes, exactly. Of course, it's important. That's why I'm yelling. Nice costume, weirdo. [grunting continues] -[boy] Heads up. -[bicycle bell rings] [grunts] [witch] Sample, get your sample? -[witch laughs] -[grunts] Free sample? They're delicious. [grunts] [bell jingling] [grunting] [grunts] [growls] [grunting continues] [grunting] No, no, no! [yelping] [yelps, screams] Harold? I can't find him. [sighs] He's not downstairs. He's not upstairs either. -Where can he be? -I don't know. He must've gone out. We have to find him. We'll get a map and search the city. We can search downtown. We have to search the whole city. I think my mom has an extra map. We can go stop at my house on the way. Marshall? Why is the TV remote stuck to the ceiling. Uh, come on. Let's go. -We need to split up. -[Amy] He can't be far-- [screams] Oh! Hi. Hi, Mr. Killbot, I mean, Mr. Kubot. W-What are, what are you doing here? Something happened last night. There was a break-in in my house. You didn't happen to see anybody or notice anything? Anything out of the ordinary? -No. Everything was very in the ordinary. -[laughs nervously] -Yeah, we didn't see a thing. -Or hear a thing. -No strange sights or sounds. -Nothing. All right. Well, we'd better be going now. -Sorry we couldn't be more helpful. Bye! -Have a nice day! [grunting] [grunting] Huh? [grunting continues] Harold! Come on! -Where could he be? -Come on, Harold. [grunting] [screams] -[groans] -[cracking] [grunts] [yelps] [grunts] -Harold, please! -It's no use. -He could be anywhere. -Let's think about this logically. If you were a 4,000-year-old mummy, where would you go? I don't know, to get fresh bandages? Harold! -Harold! -Harold! Come on! -[Amy and Marshall] Harold! -No. You don't think… It's as good a place as any. Come on! Let's go. [whimpering] Harold! [grunting] -I told you to stay at the house. -[grunts] -What's he saying? -I don't speak mummy. [grunts] Look. They have the same amulet. [Amy] Remember what the tour guide told us? If Harold and the princess were in love, maybe the amulet is like some ancient Egyptian engagement ring, and he wants to be back together with her. Yeah. Maybe you're right. -Yeah. -[Harold whimpering] -Come on, Harold. We have to go. -[whimpering continues] It's not safe for you here. I get it. You want to be with her. But not right now. Harold, he's right. If anyone figures out what you are, they'll send you to a lab to do experiments on or put you in a freak show. Please, Harold. Come on. [Harold groans] -Hey! No touching the exhibits. -[grunting] Huh? -Sorry, sir. We're just leaving. -Yeah. What's with the costume? -Uh, he's a huge Egyptology fan. -Halloween fanatic. Big into cosplay. -[Harold grunting] -Cosplay? -[grunting] -No, Harold, no. Come on. I'm telling you. Harold's gonna come back the first chance he gets. We can't keep him away forever. We need some expert advice. Who? We don't know any Egyptologists. But we do know a monsterologist. Buzzy! Come on! -That's true. -Who's Buzzy? -[grunts] -No, Harold, come on. Let's go. Faster! [Buzzy] A living mummy? Give me a break. No, he really is a 4,000-year-old mummy. -Honest. -Okay. Then if he's really a dead living mummy, he wouldn't have a pulse now, would he? -[Harold grunts] -[arm crunches] [grunts] Holy guacamole! -[grunts] -He's dead. [Buzzy gasps] He's dead! He's d-- He's dead! He-- He-- He's dead! He's dead, he's dead! He-- He-- He's dead! [Buzzy squeals, gasps] -He's dead. -Yeah, that was our point. Do you realize t-this is the most amazing discovery since penicillin? -Or Atlantis? -[TV playing jazz music] -Actually, Atlantis is still lost. -We're talking reanimating the dead. You should call the Smithsonian or a scientific journal, or those tabloid magazines. [Marshall] Hold on! We have to keep him a secret. -[grunts, cracks] -Wait a minute. Wasn't there a mummy stolen on its way to the museum? -We didn't steal it. -Uh, yeah. We're trying to stop the people who did from getting their hands on Harold. -[grunts] -[Buzzy] Harold? -Y-You're calling him Harold? -Can't just say, "hey, mummy." Anyways, we were hoping you might be able to help us figure out how he came back to life and what we do with him. I wonder if it has anything to do with that amulet. It could be the key to the puzzle. -Huh. Good thinking. -["Bop Dem Bones" playing] ♪ Shake your hips Now take a chance ♪ ♪ Take a dive into the unknown ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're gonna bop them bones ♪ -Do you see what I'm seeing? -Yeah. ♪ Bop 'em, get 'em jumpin' ♪ He has potential. ♪ 'Cause we're gonna, gonna… ♪ -[Marshall] Harold. -[grunts] Huh? -Come here. -[grunts] Uh, hi, uh-- -Mind if I get a look at your amulet? -[roars] -[screams] -No, Harold. Friend. Friend. Yeah. I guess he's a little bit protective about his amulet. Yeah. You think? [sighs] [Buzzy] Hmm. Oh, there's an inscription. Inscription? Uh, can you help us out with it? Yes, but it's gonna take me a minute or two, or one hundred, to figure it out. [sighs] Let me take a photo. [Gilbert] Don't worry, Harold. -Buzzy's just trying to help you. -It's okay. [grunts, finger cracks] Yeah. -[shutter clicks] -[yelps, grunts] -No. It's okay. -It's okay. She just took a photo. -[grunts] -[Buzzy] Sorry! -[Buzzy chuckles] -[groans] I'll see if I can get the inscription deciphered. I'll get back to you guys soon. Thanks. Let's go. We got a mummy movie to make. Hmm. [footsteps approaching] [bell tolls] Ms. Ravensworth? -You wanted to see me? -How does one misplace a mummy? Did it get up and walk off? It's only temporary. I just need a little more time. You have 48 hours to produce one Twelfth-Dynasty Egyptian mummy with coffin, or I will expect a full reimbursement on my advance, plus a hefty and painful penalty. -[woman's neck cracking] -[soft piano music playing] [squelching] -[footsteps] -[Marshall] Guys! Here it is. Fresh off the printer. The screenplay for The Mummy's Awesome Revenge. Gil, you're playing Professor Glunditchberg, the brave and bold Egyptologist. Couldn't I get a character with a more pronounceable name? [chuckles] Amy, you're Dr. Ilsa Von Keebler, international archaeologist and social media influencer. Is that even a thing? -As for you, Harold… -[roars] …you're playing the mummy! [laughs] -[Diane] Hey, kids. -How's it going? -[Gilbert] Great. -[Amy] Really good. [chuckles] -Who's your friend? -Um… -Him? -[grunts] Um… That-- That's Harold. A kid from school. He's playing the killer mummy. He's a sixth-grader? Oh, he should actually be in ninth, but he got held back… -[grunts] -…several times. [chuckles] Well, remember how you said you couldn't find costumes for your movie? Guess who found them? Cool. -Nice. -[chuckles] A few years back, my agency did a spot for Animal Crackers with a jungle set. Luckily, we still had the costumes in storage. We really need to get started filming. [Diane] Uh, okay. Well, good luck with your blockbuster. [Amy, Gilbert] Thank you. See ya. [groans] [sighs] That guy is so annoying. Yeah. So annoying. He brought costumes for our movie. So, what's your problem with him exactly? He's just so-- so-- so Ted. Is it that he's so Ted, or is it that you don't want anyone to be with your mom? No. [sighs] No. You know, when my dad remarried, I wouldn't talk to my new stepdad for almost six months. Total silent treatment. Then one day I realized something. He makes him happy, and he makes him laugh. Maybe I was wrong about him. He and I are super close now. So maybe you should give this Ted guy a chance. But, um, whatever. It's none of my business. Sorry for butting in. Let's get back to work. She's kind of got a point, Marsh. Mm-hmm. We should get back to work. -[Harold snores] -We've got a movie to make. -Come on, Harold. -[grunts] [Marshall] Mummy's Awesome Revenge. Scene one, take one. At last! We found it, Dr. Von Keebler! Oh. There it is. The lost pyramid of Yo-Yo-Hotep. Let's go! [Amy] Adventure awaits. [Gilbert] Yeah. [bats squealing] Okay. All we have to do is navigate this dark spooky corridor, solve ancient riddles, and make it across the pit of a thousand disgusting horrors. It's going to be a day, so if you want to turn back, as a scientist, I could not scientifically blame you. No, Dr. Von Keebler! We've come too far to give up. Totally. But, you know, it's just a lot of dangerous-- -Uh-- Danger. -Danger? Professor Glunditchberg never runs from danger. We must face our fears. Ah! Aha! [gasps] We did it! Now, if my calculations are correct, we'll find the legendary silver serpent inside this coffin. -Oh. [gasps] -[coffin creaks] -[roars] -Oh, no. It's a live mummy. And it wants to eat our brains. [groans] -Cut. -[grunts] Harold, you're supposed to be fierce. -[groans] -I'm not really seeing fierce. [groaning] Take two. -[gasps] -Oh, no. It's a live mummy. And it wants to eat our brains. [grunts, groans] -Reset! -[megaphone screeches] [groans, grunts] -[groans] -[Marshall] Cut! [grunts, gulps] -[Marshall] Cut! -[burps] -Ew! -[Marshall] Cut! -[snores] -[Marshall] Cut! [roars] -Cut! Nailed it! -[megaphone screeches] -[grunts] -[laughs] -Marshall? -[all gasp] It's your friend Buzzy. She says it's important. [groaning] [Buzzy] This is a database of the hieroglyphics known to mainstream Egyptologists. And they were no help. But you've got to understand, hieroglyphics aren't like the alphabet. There aren't 26. There are, like, a gajillion. So, then I did some digging around. I have my secret sources. -[Marshall] Wikipedia, huh? -[Buzzy] No. I actually had to dig through old-timey books. Very 20th century. Anyway, here's what I found when I decoded the hieroglyphics. The amulet is like a three-day pass back into the world of the living. It's activated by exposure to moonlight. That explains why Harold came back to life. Gilbert exposed the amulet to moonlight in Kubot's basement. You're right. -Yay me. [chuckles] -I went ahead and translated the symbols. Here's what they say. [exhales] [in spooky voice] "This amulet will raise the dead." -[cackles] -Can you just read it in a regular voice? Oh, sorry. [chuckles] I thought it would give it a little more gravitas. -No. -Nah. Ah. "This amulet will raise the dead. For three days they will live instead. But in their coffin, they must be by midnight on the day of three or doomed forever they will be throughout all of absurdity." Throughout all of absurdity? Eternity. Not absurdity. -"Doomed throughout all of eternity." -[Harold grunts] -Yes, that sounds so much better. -Uh, no! It sounds horrible! I guess on the bad news scale from one to ten, that's an 11. Maybe 11 and a half. What does "doomed throughout all eternity" mean? Well, if he doesn't make it back into his coffin by day three, he could turn to dust. [gulping] Third full day would be tomorrow! That means that we need to get Harold back into his coffin by midnight on Halloween. But Harold just got here. He can't go. He's our friend. Friends have each other's backs, right? So, we have to do what's right by Harold. Even if it's not what we want. [sighs] [groans] Yeah. [sighs] We have to do what's right by Harold. We're gonna put him back. Okay. So, here's the plan. We slip in through the basement like before, put Harold back into his coffin and get out without Kubot ever knowing. We make an anonymous call to the museum and tell them where they can find the stolen mummy. Harold goes back to the museum and reunited with his GF. Win-win. Well, except for Kubot. But let's make this quick. We don't wanna run into Kubot again. Oh! That guy is seriously scary. -[groans] -[Marshall] Let's go. -[all panting] -[Harold groaning] Are you sure he's not home? He's not home. It's fine. [chattering] So much for him not being home. [Kubot] Take the other side. Oh, no. What are they doing with Harold's coffin? -They're moving it! -[Harold groans] -[Amy] Duck! -[Marshall] Whoa! Okay. Let's go. [both grunting] [Harold groans] Careful! [grunts] It's heavy. [groans] [engine revs] [groans] [Kubot grunts] [grunts] [Kubot grunts] Take it to the plant. It'll be safer there. -You got it. -[groans] -Plant? -I don't know. [Harold groans] [engine starts, revs] [whimpers] It's okay, Harold. We're gonna get it back for you. [groans] Somehow. Let's go. [grunts] -[bottle rattles] -Hmm. "Gilbert Anderson." [laughs] [upbeat rap song playing] [Gilbert] Got snacks! [chuckles] [chuckles] [groans] Don't worry, Harold. I wouldn't forget you. I know you like your hot sauce. -[chuckles] -[groans] All right. So, what do we got? Nothing about Kubot except his address and that he's an antiques dealer. What about the plant Kubot mentioned? Maybe it's a giant man-eating plant. Maybe. But, in the real world, a plant can also mean a factory or a warehouse. But what about the blue truck they put the coffin in? It had a penguin on it. If we figure out what the penguin stood for, we might be able to figure out where the truck came from and where the coffin is. -[knocking] -[groans] We're kinda busy right now, Mom. [Kubot] Oh! I'm nobody's mom. [Harold groans] It's Kubot! What's he doing here? If he sees Harold we're done. Whichever one of you is Gilbert Anderson, I'd like to return something to you that you dropped… in my basement. My inhaler! I was wondering where that was. It's no use, kiddywinkies. I know what you took and I intend to get it back. -[groans] -Now open the door. -[banging on door] -[gasps] -[Kubot] Open the door! -Oh, no! Hide Harold! What do we do? What do we do? Draw them away so they don't see Harold. Wait. I know a way out. Uh-- Great! Harold, you stay here. -[groans] -[Gilbert] Come on. This way. -[banging on door continues] -[Kubot] Come on. Open it! [grunts] Break it down. [grunting] [Marshall] Harold, stay. -[Kubot] I warned you! -[Gordo grunts] Okay, coast is clear. Let's go. -[Kubot] Come on! -[Gordo grunts] -[grunts] -[Marshall] Hey! Over here! -Hey, kids! -[Gilbert] Later, Killbot. -[Gilbert gasps] -Hey! -Go, go, go, go! -Run! -[Marshall] Whoa! -[Amy gasps] -Lose something? -Uh-- Thanks? I don't know how you kids managed to steal that mummy, but I want it back. A mummy? Either of you see a mummy? -Uh, nope. Haven't seen one. -Me neither. I am not a patient man! Tell us, we'll go our separate ways. No harm, no foul. If we tell you, you promise to leave us alone? Oh, you have my word of honor. -He's right behind you. -[groans] -What the… -[gasps] That thing can't be a mummy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's him. -But it's alive. -I mean, grab him! Grab him now! [Harold groans] -[grunts] -[both] Ow! -[growls] -[both scream] -Whoa! -[both grunt] -Whoa! -[roars] This would be a good time to go. Come on, Harold! Run! [all] Run, run, run. [Gilbert] Go, go, go, go! Hurry! Come on! What was that? I remember reading about the legend of reanimation, but I thought it was a superstition. That thing was the mummy we stole? Yes. And my price for it just went up. [chuckles] Way up! This is really, really bad. What do we do? We can't go home with Kubot looking for us. We gotta find a place to hide for a while. Marshall! [chuckles] -[groans] -Hey, gang. -Hey, Harold. It's Harold, isn't it? -[groans] [chuckles] I thought you finished your movie. We're doing some extra scenes. -Yeah, filming. We're filming. -Extra scenes. Um, but, uh, what are you supposed to be dressed as? Oh! Uh… I'm the Hallow-Easter Bunny. [all chuckle] What are you doing here? I just picked up Halloween candy. Don't want anyone to go away empty-handed tonight. You want to help me pass it out? We're actually going to the Halloween Carnival at school. [Gilbert] The carnival. Does Morse Park Middle still do its Halloween carnival? -[groaning] -I used to love that. Uh, uh, uh-- No, Harold. -[grunts] -No treats for you in there. You know, we really should be going now. -Uh… -[Amy] Yeah. Okay. -Ted, you grew up in this town, right? -Mm-hmm. Do you remember a company that used a blue truck with a penguin on it? Erin's Ice Cream. Best ice cream ever. Every kid in town cried the day they went out of business. Do they have a factory or a plant in town? Uh-- Not exactly in town. Out on Route 12. When I was a kid we went there on a field trip. Still there, sitting empty. Why? We have an upcoming school project on local history. -Yeah. Bye! -I'm happy to help you with it. -[Marshall] We'll be in touch! -[groans] [chuckles] Nice work. -Well, he's a nice guy. -[scoffs] [groans] -[doorbell rings] -Hmm. Happy Hallow-- [chuckles] Mr. Kubot. Trick or treating? Ha! No. I-I was wondering if your son would like to make a little extra money. I need someone to, um, do some yard work. Huh. Good idea. But I'm sorry, he's not here at the moment. -So, bye. -I don't think-- Hey. Pardon me. Here we go. Three extra tons of sugar-rush for the local kids. -[chuckles] -Thanks, hon. Uh-- Mr. Kubot here would like to offer Marshall a job. Oh. I just saw him down the street. -Really? -He was with his friends, including the big one dressed like a mummy. -[chuckles] -Oh. Uh-- But they all took off for the Halloween Carnival. I'll catch up with him later. Thank you. [Diane] Good night, Mr. Kubot. Okay. How do we get Harold out to that ice cream factory? It has to be at least ten miles out of town. Yeah, and I don't see asking our parents to give us a ride. Uh-- Buzzy! Buzzy can drive us! Come on. She's working the haunted house at the Halloween carnival. But we need costumes to get in, and ours are back at our houses. We're just gonna have to improvise. -Come on. -[groans] Amy, how come you're the only one out of all of us that looks not so stupid? Some people are better at improvising than others? Hey. Where's Harold? Yeah. Harold! [groans, grunts] You gotta stick with us, Harold. It's not safe to run off. [groans] Does Harold need a costume? [Marshall] Well, Kubot's looking for a mummy. And Harold's the Invisible Man. It's the perfect disguise for a mummy. -Come on! -[groans] [suspenseful organ music playing] [rock music playing] -[groaning] -Come on, Harold. [Harold groaning continues] [mechanical laughing] Check it out! [mechanical laughing] [whimpers] [groans] [mechanical laughing] -[whimpers] -It's okay, Harold. They're just costumes. -Wow! Look at that. -Stay focused. -[groans] -What are you three supposed to be? Losers? You don't need a costume for that. And what are you supposed to be, Todd? I'm a cereal killer. Get it? Cereal killer? It's better than whatever you're wearing. -Hey, wait! What's your problem? -[grunts] -[chuckles] -[growls] [gasps] [gasps, groans] [all gasp] Ooh! -[chuckles] -[Marshall] Good job, Harold. [laughs] [people chuckling] Hey, this time it's on you, Todd. -[grunts] What are you laughing at? -[mechanical chuckle] We'll go find Buzzy. Gil, you stay here and mummy-sit. -[grunts] -Okay. Come on, Harold. -It's about time you tried some nachos. -[muffled] Nachos? [haunted house roars] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Can we go in? We have to find Buzzy. No, you can wait at the back with everyone else. We only have to go in for a minute. It's okay, Marsh. The line will move fast. Better luck next time. Ring toss. Step right up and try to win the purple-eyed panda. [Harold] Huh? Wanna play? It's showtime. Come on, Harold. Step right up. Three, please. -Good luck. -[Harold] Mm-hmm. [groans] You will be mine. -[grunts] -[groans] [mumbling] Rats! Use the force, Gilbert. Oh! I was so close. Three more, please? All right. Here you go. [groaning] Um-- What? You wanna try? [grunts] Okay. But if you win, we're both sharing the panda, okay? [grunts] [grunts, groans] [laughs] -Holy cows! -[Gilbert] Sorry! He doesn't know his own strength. Come on! -[Harold groans] -[sighs] Finally. [haunted house roars] [cackling] [roars] -[growls, grunts] -Whoa! Come on. Let's find Marshall and Amy. [growls] Oh. No, no, no, Harold. She's just a pretend princess. That's our teacher, and she's really, really mean when you don't do your homework. -[growling] -No, come-- Oh, Harold! But-- but-- Come back! [grunting] Oh, uh… [chuckles] [grunting] -Can't understand 'cause of fake teeth. -Harold! -[grunting] -Come on! [hat and sunglasses clatter] Oh, you wanna dance? -[grunts] -Okay. Um… -["Calling All the Monsters" playing] -♪ Tonight all the monsters gonna dance ♪ ♪ We're coming to get you ♪ ♪ Tonight all the monsters gonna dance ♪ ♪ We're coming to get you ♪ -Oh, my. -[grunting] [Miss Pratt] Yeah!

Get the mummy and meet me. -Okay. -He's here! -[grunts] -Kubot's right behind us! -What? -Th-this way! -[Marshall] Let's go! -[shouting] There's a door behind one of these. When you catch that mummy, distract it. -[Buzzy] Found it. -[Marshall] Great! -Hey! Stop right there! -[grunts] -[growls] -You guys really wanna do this again? Listen, we don't want trouble. This mummy doesn't belong to you. He doesn't belong to anybody. He's a person. Or-- or at least, he was one. [roars] -What do we do? -Kubot said to distract it, so… -Hey, nice mummy. -[rattling] -Breath mint? -[roars] He's distracted. Now what do we do? -Harold, watch out! -No! Behind you! -[ding] -[grunts] [whoosh sound] [groans] -Harold! -[Kubot laughs] -Pays to know ancient history. -What did you do? The amulet giveth and the amulet taketh away. He's harmless. Let's go! Come on, we got a buyer waiting. [Gordo and Hersh grunt] -This thing smells rank! -I don't know. -Kind of smells like Ocean Breeze to me. -[gags] If you know what's good for you, you'll forget this happened. [laughs] Let's go, boys! [Marshall] No! [tires screech] -I failed him! -Marsh, we did all we could. There's nothing else we could've done. He was counting on me. Now he's gonna turn to dust! Not necessarily. There's a couple of hours till midnight. They're taking him to the old ice cream factory. -What can we do? Those guys are dangerous. -We're gonna figure it out. All I do know is we have to help Harold. Friends, backs, remember? -I'm so in. -Me too. Whoa, whoa. I don't know-- -Gilbert's in. -Whoa! [engine starts] [tires screech] [thrilling music playing] [rattling] Any idea just where this old ice cream factory is? I don't know. Ted just said Route 12. This is Route 12, and it's over 30 miles long. [Amy] Let me try something. It's 1600 Oak View Road. Turnoff is in five miles to the right. Local history website has it. Impressive. Future investigative reporter. [chuckles] [light buzzing, crackling] [ominous organ music playing] Okay, so here's the plan. We breach the perimeter of Kubot's hideout and sneak in. -We breach what? -Just go with it. Step two, create a diversion distracting Kubot and his men away from Harold. Step three, we put Harold back into his coffin and return him to the museum to be reunited with his girlfriend. -And what about Kubot? -Oh, this is the best part. We call it in. Kubot gets arrested. Boom! We're heroes. We get a parade, a movie deal and an A on our Egyptology project. Okay. Great plan, except for one little part. -Which part? -All of it! Okay? Dude, we're 12. Twelve! One… two. I'm still working out the details. If we could figure out a way to really distract Kubot, Marshall's crazy idea might just work. -Hmm? -I might be able to help you. Check out those boxes in the back. Strobe lights, web guns, sound effect machines, mega slime, remote control spider, you name it. -There's enough to distract an army. -Buzzy, you're a genius! It's just stuff left over from the haunted house. But I'll take genius any day. Less than an hour to spare. Cutting it close, eh, Kubot? Oh, I think once you see what I have to offer, you'll agree it was well worth the wait. Here it is. I have waited years to acquire this for my collection. Boys? Where's the mummy? No mummy, no deal. Remember? Ah, yes, the mummy. How silly of me. -[thud] -Ms. Ravensworth, if you follow me, I'll lead you to your acquisition. It's right over… -here. -What on Earth? Why isn't it in the coffin? And why is it in chains? There's been a new wrinkle. Turns out this mummy is way more valuable than we agreed upon. Listen, Kubot, if you think you're gonna squeeze more money at the last minute, you are gravely mistaken. We had a deal! We did have a deal for a mummy. A dead mummy. What other kind is there? [chain clinks] [whoosh sound] [growls] [grunting] -[roars] -[roars] -[both roaring] -[chains rattling] Convinced? This is incredible. [low growling] -[grunting] -[ding] [whoosh sound] So, do we renegotiate, or do I see if some other collector might like a live mummy for their collection? I am ready to talk. Please. Step into my office. Hmm! [Marshall] It's the penguin truck. -[Amy] Everyone ready to do this? -Uh… [Buzzy] Let's make sure the coast is clear first. This place is a lot scarier than I imagined. Everything is a lot scarier than you imagined. Uh, Marshall? I don't know if I can do this. Come on, Gil. We're in this together. I'm sorry, Marshall. I can't. Gilbert, face your fears, remember? This time the fear is for a good reason. Survival! But what about Harold? He's our friend. Like Amy said, friends have each other's backs, remember? Friends don't get each other killed, Marshall. I'm sorry, but I'm outta here. Fine! Go home, Gilbert! We don't need you anyway. Come on. We're running out of time. [mysterious music playing] [Kubot speaks indistinctly] -[Ms. Ravensworth] We agreed… -Come on. [Kubot] I can get ten buyers tonight… I wouldn't have to go online. I can make some phone calls. -[Amy] There's Harold. -He's gonna get a million. -[Hersh] He better… -[Amy] And the amulet. If taking the amulet off deanimated Harold, then wouldn't putting it back on reanimate him? -[whispers] Yes. [chuckles] -Okay. New plan. We distract the guards long enough to get the amulet onto Harold. Once he wakes up, it's gonna be revenge of the mummy. Let's go. Like, fine. There's brave and then there's stupid, and I'm not stupid. [screeches] [scoffs] Whatever, dude. -I've seen way scarier the last few days. -[hoots] Not that anyone cares. "Face your fears, Gilbert. Friends have each other's backs, Gilbert." -[hoots] -Ugh. I'm so tired of hearing that. -[sighs] -[hoots] Marshall, that's who. He always says I should have his back. -Well, who has my back? -[hoots] Me. That's hoo-hoo. Look, you can stare all you want, but I'm not going back there. It's scary. But… [sighs] …this wasn't just scary. It was real dangerous. And my friends are right in the middle of it. [sighs] And Professor Glunditchberg never runs from danger. Yeah. We must face our fears! [hooting] Yeah. -Stinks. -Right? I'm still smelling Ocean Breeze. [maniacal laughter] -What is that? -[evil laughter] [metal clanging] Better check. We'll check this side, you check the other. -[laughter continues] -Come on. [clanging continues] [sneaky music playing] [evil laughter] [scoffs] [maniacal laughter] [recording stops] Someone's playing a joke? -Doesn't look real. -Right? -[Buzzy growls] -[screams] Ha! Didn't blink that time! [howls] Hey! Hey, stop! [clanging continues] [spider grunts] [motor whirring] [spider grumbles] "Step into my parlor," said the spider to the creep. [squirting] -[web splats] -[gasps] [intense music playing] It's okay, Harold. I've got you. [exhales deeply] Hey! What do you think you're doing? [muffled] Hey! Hey! Let me go! -[grunts] -Look what we found. You're gonna be in big trouble. Let me go! I said let me go! There was originally four kids. Where's the other one? Telling every adult we know. They're coming to get you. Somehow, I'm doubting that. -Where did these kids come from? -Don't worry. I'll handle them. -[whispers] But they've seen our faces! -Like I said, I'll handle them. -What does he mean by that? -I don't wanna find out. So, Ms. Ravensworth, shall we wrap this up? No pun intended. Please! You need to put the mummy back into his coffin. Now! -What? -He'll turn to dust at midnight. Honest. -What are they talking about? -They're stalling. No, it's on the amulet. He'll turn to dust at midnight. -What if they're telling the truth? -What do they know? Please! We'll forget we ever saw any of this. You can keep the mummy. Just please, please put him back into his coffin. He's our friend. Put a cork in it! That other punk kid's gotta be here. [Gilbert] Right here. -[heroic music playing] -[both] Gilbert? Professor Glunditchberg to the rescue. -Go round him up. -[Amy] Watch out! Get the amulet, Gil! You got this, Gil. Hmm! Whoo! -[rope creaking] -[screaming] [gasps] Whoa! -[shouts] -Ooh! -Gil, are you okay? -Gilbert! Gilbert? -[amulet clinks] -[triumphant music] -Yeah! -Get him! Get that amulet! -Watch out! -[Amy] Gilbert! No. I want no trouble here. Give it up, kid. Come on, kid. Hand it over. Please. Gil, how'd you like to win something way cooler than a purple-eyed panda? -Mmm? [gasps] -[magical tinkling sound] -[glass clinks] -Ah! Oh! Rats! -[record scratches] -I haven't been lucky tonight. I believe in you. [Gordo] Come on, kid. Last warning. -Give up the amulet. -Come on. [tense music playing] [amulet clinking] -[whoosh sound] -[gasps] -Yes! -[children cheer, laugh] -[growling] -No! You did it! -[roars] -[chains rattle] -[roars] -Get that mummy! [growls, grunts] [grunts] -[gasps] -[growls] -[Marshall] Way to go, Harold. -Harold, watch out! -[growls] -Get him! [Gilbert] You got this, Harold! -Yes! -[shouts, groans] -[metal clangs] -Whoa! Let's get outta here! -[Amy] They're getting away! -[grunts] I've got this. [Buzzy] Don't worry. They're heading into our trap. [remote beeps] [both] Oh! -Yes! -Whoa! -[laughs] -[Kubot groans] Nicely done. To do that required great skull. -[all laugh] -Nice. Oh! -[children] Harold! -[grunts] [Gilbert and Marshall laugh] -I want my mummy. -[muffled groans] You sure picked the wrong mummy to mess with. -And the wrong kids. -Yeah, you did. But you picked exactly the right Buzzy, and she just called the authorities. So what made you come back, Professor Glunditchberg? Yeah. I-I thought you were scared. You know, I realized I was more scared of losing you all than I was of those guys. Losing you would make my world really, really small. We are big-world people, right? -[laughs] -Yeah. Yeah, we are. Now let's grab the coffin and get Harold back to the museum. -[Amy] Right. -[Marshall] Let's go! [gasps] Oh, no! It's destroyed! [Gilbert] What are we gonna do? [groans, whines] Midnight is in 28 minutes. What about the empty coffin in the museum? The one everyone took photos in? -[both] Mummy! -That's a great idea! It's just a reproduction. I'm not sure it would work. It's the only choice we've got. Come on. [tires screech] [tires screeching] Come on. [doors rattle] [Gilbert] Ah! -[doors rattle] -Come on. Harold, do your stuff. [growls] -[metal clangs] -[alarm blaring] -[Marshall] Let's go! -[Amy] Hurry! I'll wait here for the authorities and stall them! Okay, Harold. You grab the coffin, and we'll grab the lid. Come on. -[grunts] -[thud] -[grumbling] -[Marshall] Harold, what are you doing? You gotta get in your coffin. It's almost midnight. -What is he doing? -I-I think I know. -He's bringing her… -[boys] To the moonlight! [whooshing sound] [gasps] [bandages stretch] [Harold gasps] [sighs happily] [laughs] [gasps, sighs happily] [sighs] Come on. We're running out of time. Cut him some slack. He hasn't seen his girlfriend in, like, 4,000 years. Look how happy he is. People who make each other happy should be together. -Even mummies. -Hmm. Think they'll be with each other in the afterlife? Not if he doesn't get his butt in that coffin. Come on, Harold. Please. We're running out of time. [Harold grunting] [Amy] Take care, Harold. I'll never call this town boring again. And I'll never forget you. [grunts] Bye, Harold. You're the not-scariest scary guy I've ever met. [grunts] [bandage stretches] [sighs] I always thought that it would be really cool to see a real-live monster. -[sighs] -[crying] And I was right. But… Goodbye, Harold. [grunting sadly] [whimpering] [grunting] Oh, and I almost forgot this. [grunting happily] [both moan] [whooshing] [tinkling] [alarm continues blaring] Oh, finally! Come on! Go, go, go, go, go! [laughs] [engine starts] [sirens wailing] [female anchor] In a strange turn of events, last night, an ancient Egyptian mummy that had been stolen in transit to the local museum mysteriously turned up there holding a bottle of hot sauce. Don't dillydally. I don't want you to be late. And in related news, an anonymous tip led to the arrest of several local residents believed to have stolen the mummy along with many other valuable… You haven't seen the TV remote, have you? You know, I have a feeling it'll eventually turn up. -Or down. -[chuckles] Speaking of mummies, a dancer dressed as a mummy put Walgrove on the map. He was the hit at a local middle school Halloween carnival, and then he took social media by storm. No way! He's a bona fide star, even though nobody can seem to figure out who he is. -[doorbell rings] -Oh. Can you get that? That's probably Ted. He's coming over for a late breakfast. Ted, how you doing? Good to see ya. Really? Really. Come on in! Do you know you have boxes of birdseed on your front porch? Also, hi. Weird. Hi. I didn't know what pastries you like, so I bought one of everything. Well, nothing says breakfast like dessert. [laughs] Hey, Ted, so I'm thinking my next movie's gonna be about a vampire, and I could definitely use your help. Uh… Sure. I'd love to. [imitates Romanian accent] I've always wanted to play a vampire. Actually, you'd be its victim. Ah, okay, that sounds good. I'm in. Cool. Uh, I'm gonna go wash my hands because I definitely sampled one or two of those on the way over here, so… Come on. Ooh. So why the sudden change in attitude towards Ted? Well, he makes you happy, doesn't he? Yeah, he does. People who make each other happy, they should be together. I love you. [chuckles] [clatters] -[sighs] -[squish] Oh. Hey, guys! Don't freak out or anything, but you're looking at the Morse Park Middle School Gazette's newest star reporter. -Hey! -Hey! Congrats! That's amazing. I pitched them the inside scoop of the mummy story, and they loved it. -What? -Wait a minute. "Inside scoop"? Yeah. The whole story. Except for the part about the mummy coming back to life -and single-handedly bringing down Kubot. -[sighs] That part I'm saving for my autobiography. [chuckles] This gives you something to do before you move back to Rockport. You know, Rockport is nice and all, but I never would've met a live mummy there. [chuckles] Or you guys. I think I'm gonna stick around. Hmm. So what do you do for fun in this town when you don't have a mummy around? How about we go see Warthead? -You? No way. -What? What? We still haven't seen the ending, right? "We"? I thought you didn't like scary movies. Look, I brought a mummy back to life and helped take down that evil next-door neighbor. How scary can a monster movie be? -[inhaler sprays] -[laughs] -Sounds like a plan. -Wait till the ending. -It's awesome. Warthead jumps-- -Hey, hey! No spoilers. -[school bell rings] -Come on!
