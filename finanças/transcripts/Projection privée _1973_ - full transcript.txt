THIS MOVIE WON THE GRAND PRIX OF FRENCH FILM IN 1973 Hello there, is this a good time? Yes. So, you've read the screenplay? It's good, right? But do we really know what the audience likes? Depends whether they're perverts or prudes. Sure. Of course I believe it, or I wouldn't be producing the movie. No, not very expensive, but not very cheap, either. It takes place in 1958, so there are costumes. Of course. But above all, it needs a star. -Yes. -Who do you have? Well, for the main role, we were thinking about Eva. Eva? If you can get her… If we had Eva, would you agree to distribute it? Yes. Yes, well… that depends. On what conditions? The usual… Yes, all right. Very well, yes. Okay. Yes, fine. Okay, I'll call you then. All right, goodbye, old fellow. See you. Did you get that? Yes. Eva needs to accept. Well, you're the director. It's up to you now. Stop! Cut! Bring on the extras, please. Give the weapon back. Are we done with the crane? Yes! Extras, I never said you could leave! Please, stay where you are! Denis Mallet. -Oh, yes! Hello. -Hello. I've brought you my screenplay. You shouldn't have bothered, we're heading back. We're in a bit of a rush. I'm anxious to hear what you think. "Marthe." It's the story of a divorcée living with a younger man. A younger man? How much younger? Not that much younger, he's 25. He lives with her. He wants to get into the movie industry. What do you mean, the movie industry? He wants to be a director. It excites her. She lives vicariously through him. But then he meets a young girl and leaves her. That's a little tired, isn't it? She kills herself. Oh, right. It happens, doesn't it? Yes, but it's just that I've died in both my latest movies. Don't you think people will get bored? If you like the role, why does that matter? I'll read it. Eva, it's time for makeup. Another take? No, we're moving on. We're doing your close-up. I need some blood, then. Michel! Can you bring me the blood, please? -You want blood? -Yes. I fell onto this side, see? -Two drops, right there. -There? Yeah. Yes, but don't go over the top. All right, I'll leave you to it. If you could read it quickly, I need your answer. How about we discuss it in Paris? When? As soon as I get back. Perfect. Great. Thank you. Excuse me. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Shall we? I'll draw it on, like this. Yes, that'll do. Don't your friends ever come by? We arrange to have the house when they're not here. Denis needs peace and quiet to work. Really? What's he working on at the moment? He's preparing his next movie. What's it about? I don't know. Doesn't he get you to read his screenplays? Normally, yes. But this one's a mystery. He still hasn't shown me anything. -When will it be finished? -I don't know. I must admit, I've never seen any of his movies. I'm not surprised. He hasn't made that many. They didn't do very well commercially. It's lucky I work, otherwise we'd have nothing to eat. Hello? Yes, she's here. I'll just fetch her. Kate, it's for you! Really? It's a guy. "Sequence three. "Rue Marthe, outside on the street, at night. "An empty shot. A Traction Avant pulls up. "Marthe is driving. She gets out of the car. "Lateral tracking shot. "She opens the back door and collects her parcels. "She closes the car door. Continued lateral tracking shot." Don't worry, Mrs. Victor, it's only me. Mr. Philippe just picked up the mail! Wonderful, thank you. -Happy New Year! -Thank you. -It's me. -Where are you? Rue Bonaparte. Marthe isn't back yet. If that's all you wanted to tell me… No, don't be silly. I'm telling you that I'm bothered. Bothered about what? Having to leave you alone tonight. I'm going to the movies with Colette. Yeah. Either way, I'm sad that I can't be with you. Listen, Philippe, if you're sad, there's something you can do about it. Tell Marthe the truth and be with me. You promised it would be sorted by the end of the year. I know, but I can't do that to her on a night like tonight. Well, that's too bad. Happy New Year. Give Raymond a kiss from me. I swear, it's over with Marthe. You don't love her anymore, yet you're still with her. You know you're the only one for me. I know… for a few hours a week. I don't even sleep with her anymore. You're making both of us unhappy! I'm wasting my life waiting while you're unhappy, too. You can't even work. You feel bad about yourself. Hello? Tonight? Listen, Patrick, this is ridiculous. The one time I'm out in the country… Camille is so kind. That sounds like the name of a Trenet song. Yes, you're right. I like her a lot. The feeling's mutual. She never invites the girls that work for her over. Work is a bit of an exaggeration. I just steam dresses to make a little money. I'm also learning French at the Alliance Française! Have you ever had your photo taken? No, never. That's a shame. You're very photogenic. I bet that's what you thought when you saw me this morning. Don't worry, there's always a voyeuristic side to our profession. What's this Patrick's deal? What do you mean, his deal? Is he a leftist or a smoker? Both, why? I hope he's good in bed. Oh, yes, he's very good, actually. Quick, hurry! Or we'll get stuck! Goodbye! Thank you! It's going to be nice tomorrow. We'll see all the stars. I'm heading down to the pond. It'll be gorgeous right now. Is that where you want to shoot the end of the movie? You finished it? So? First impressions? It's a little difficult. It's so close to reality. There are lines I could ask for royalties on. But isn't it interesting, at least? Sure. There was real suspense, even though I knew the ending. You wonder what's going to happen right to the very end. Honestly, it's good. Really good. I'm glad you like it. You see… I was nervous about how you'd react. Why? You might have thought making a movie out of it was tasteless. No, that doesn't bother me. Seeing it written out like that makes me feel like it happened to someone else. Maybe it's because you changed the names. Except for Marthe. Why didn't you change hers? I couldn't find another one. It would change everything. This is the first time we've spoken about her since. I thought you didn't really care. She was very important to you. She was a wonderful woman. Why did you leave her? Because I met you. You know, the only thing that bothers me is that you made her kill herself. We never really found out what happened. In any case, in the movie, suicide is much more hard-hitting. It's a better expression of the truth. Perhaps, but the way you wrote it makes you responsible for her death. It even seems like you wanted it to look that way. That's not my intention. I won't spare the character I was at the time. Marthe? Marthe, are you here? Marthe! Marthe, come back! Marthe! If I understand correctly, this Philippe is some sort of gigolo. No, he works. He's an assistant director. Sure, but essentially he still lives off of Marthe, right? I guess you could say that. He lives with her, she's the breadwinner, she's a lawyer. He doesn't always have work. You know what it's like. We're in a tough industry. And the watch? He doesn't take it. That's all it takes. You're very moral, aren't you? But you're not entirely wrong. Philippe's attitude is somewhat ambiguous. Are you sure you don't want a whisky? A little Cognac? No, thank you. You really didn't expect this? You didn't have the slightest suspicion? No. He wasn't being colder, more distant? I thought he seemed happier recently. He was always wanting to go out. Maybe that's what should have set the alarm bells ringing. Who says it isn't just some run-of-the-mill, meaningless affair? If you'd heard them on the phone… No, it must have been going on for a while. I remember something else, now. In March, when I was in Mégève… I should never have left him alone in Paris. What are you doing here? You weren't at the station. I took a cab. What time is it? The alarm must not have gone off. I'm so sorry. When I didn't see you there, I wondered what had happened to you. I saw the empty bedroom. Are you sleeping in here now? I don't like being in the big bed without you. Are you bored of me? You know I have a lot of work at the moment. Well, I'm happy to be home. Will you make room for me? You caught the sun. Yes, but I must look awful. I haven't slept a wink. This is smaller than a bunk on a sleeping car! You really camped out here, huh? We should redecorate, turn it into a real office. No, why? It's fine the way it is. Yes, but you won't be an assistant all your life. You'll be working for yourself. You need a place to write, to hold meetings. Well? Well what? Did you cheat on me a lot? Did you? Loads of times. With every station guard I could find. Well, I met this amazing girl on the train on my way home from location scouting. -Oh, really? -Yes. So, I asked her to dinner in the restaurant car and then I went home with her. And then? And then… nothing. I don't even know her name. So, it's serious? It doesn't seem that way. I can't help but think how, without that phone call, he would have been acting all night long. But why? Is he afraid of me? Cheating on me like that, on the sly, like a child hiding from his mother. Can I have a little more water? No, you're not going to take another of those pills. Do you know what time it is? We can't leave Raymond in the lurch on New Year's Eve. I'll lend you a dress. You think I want to see people right now? He's not going to ruin our night! After all, maybe this is a chance for you to be rid of him. Surely you knew that it wouldn't last forever. I always thought I'd be the first one to leave. I could see myself saying to him: "Come on, Philippe, be reasonable. "You should get married, start a family." He would have looked so miserable when I kicked him out. That, I could have handled. But this… Here, this will look great on you. I'm unlucky and you know it. I'm just so unlucky in love. Hello? Yes? Oh, it's you, Philippe. Yes, she's here. No. She doesn't want to speak to you. Because I say so, no. At Raymond's? Yes, maybe. Listen, I don't want to talk about that. Yes. Goodbye. So, then what happened? Read it, I don't know how to explain. Oh, I wanted to ask you… What made you think of me for the role? -I saw you at the theater. -Oh, really? It's pretty rare for a movie director to go to the theater. Honestly, I didn't think you were very good. -Hello, Daddy! -Hello. Who's this guy? Paul. His name is Paul. You've met my wife, Béatrice. -Hello. -Hello. Do you have any children? No, I don't. Hélène? Hélène? Kate! What are you doing here? I came to get my bag. What's that? It's for Camille. "Zen Macrobiotics". Did she ask you to get this? Yes. All right. Come on. You made me laugh the other day, on the platform. Why? You looked so strange. What do you mean? Do you realize how fast that train was going? Yes, of course, but still… -Second floor. -What? Well? Sure, great job! Is that Patrick downstairs? No, that's an American guy I'm using to get around. I see. I'll fetch your bag. Excuse me. -How's it going? -Fine. -Here. -Thanks. Are you coming in? No, I'm in a rush. There's someone waiting for her. When are you coming over? Whenever you want! How about Wednesday? My first movie is being shown at the film library, what do you say? I know it by heart, but take her along if you like. We'll meet up for dinner afterwards. Okay, thanks! Where should we meet? In front of the film library? -All right, eight o'clock sharp. -Okay! -Goodbye. -Bye! How's the collection coming along? You know, Eva called. -Seriously? -Yes. She sounded interested and wants you to call her back. Fantastic! If she accepts, that'll seal the deal! I'll call Samy. Hello? Is Samy there? Okay, I'll wait. Thanks. It's funny you thought of Eva for the role. Why? Don't you like her? Yes, I think she's great, but… She really doesn't look much like the real Marthe. Physical resemblance isn't the important thing here. Did you find someone to play you? I met an actor this morning who isn't bad. How can you say that Eva looks nothing like Marthe? You never saw Marthe. Yes, I did. I saw you one day at the movies, remember? No. The more I think about it, Eva's perfect for the role. There are some very difficult scenes, like the monologue on the highway. Eva could be excellent for that. -Hello? -Hello, Samy? What about at first? At first, it was purely sexual. When I wanted to see him, I'd call. He was doing his military service, but he'd kept his student room. He was often there. I'd go and see him just to make love. We'd have a drink, and I'd leave. Otherwise, we never saw each other. We didn't even say hello in the street. I think he liked that little routine. He had all these ideas about libertinism. That was fine by me. I was fresh out of a divorce, I wasn't looking for someone to replace Jean-Jacques. But that didn't last long. The day he left for Algeria, he'd call every quarter of an hour, in spite of what we'd agreed. At first, I'd pretend I wasn't home, but in the evenings… I was head over heels for him. I went out of my way to find out where they'd embark. But I've told you that story 20 times. Yes. But it's different now that I know how it ends. I can see myself driving in my car along the little trails of the Fontainebleau forest. There had been protests at the stations, so to prevent that happening again, they'd reopened an old railroad in the middle of the forest. We used to sneak them out, like thieves. One time, I was stopped by a patrol. I told them I was his wife, and they went to find him. You see what it all comes down to? If I hadn't seen him again that night, it would have been over. He would never have written to me. I practically forced him into it. Why do you say that? You were very happy together. Yes, that's true, especially back then. Every time he had leave, I'd go and join him in Algiers. I remember him coming in, completely filthy. I'd already have run him a bath, and he'd soak for hours. I told him everything that was going on in Paris: the people I'd seen, the plays, the movies, the politics. When he came back to Paris I should have been suspicious. Why? He was in a terrible state of depression. I had to take care of him, to take him home with me. So what? So, when you take a man in like that, sooner or later, he'll resent you. He'll want his freedom. So, you're saying everything that happened is your fault? No… I'm just trying to understand. Shit! What's the matter? I think we've got a flat tire. Look, it's that one. How does it look? I can't see anything. Hold on. Yes, there. It looks okay. You'd think they'd stop, those bastards. Having car trouble? No, we're fine. We're having a whale of a time. We'll sort it out for you. Are you headed far? Nowhere at the moment. A New Year's Eve party, I bet. That works out nicely, we're looking for one. Will you take us? Change that wheel, then we'll talk. You got it. Drive carefully, won't you? Are you a Polytechnique student? No, why? Your hands are clammy. We'll drive in front, Madeleine knows the way! Okay! You drew the short straw. -Hi! -Hello. Is Samy here? -Yes, come on in. -Thanks. -Is that you, Denis? -Yeah. We said 11 o'clock, didn't we? I overslept. Did you meet with Eva's agent? Yeah, he's a greedy guy. You said that, with Eva, you could get all the cash you wanted. Well, if I give him everything the distributor gives us in advance, we'll have nothing left to make the movie. Another thing: she wants to see you. I think she wants to make some changes. What now? Sometimes I wonder whether you really want to make this movie. Listen, it's a good screenplay. I don't see what needs changing. Yes, but I can't do anything if you don't agree. Put yourself in my shoes, buddy. Have you met? Sonia, this is Denis. Would you be a doll and make us some coffee? Coming right up. -And open the curtains as you go, OK? -Sure. How's Camille doing? Still working hard? -As always, yes. -Have a seat. What do you think of her? Nice. No, come on, honestly? She has a pretty little nose. I was thinking of casting her as Hélène. You're completely insane. No way in hell! If you saw her naked, you wouldn't be saying that. That's not the problem. Well, to be honest… I got a little ahead of myself last night… I may have promised her a small role. You'll never change, will you? Hold on. What about Raymond's niece? Raymond's niece? What does that role involve? Did you even read my script? Look. Here. Ah, the threesome scene! She'd do very well in that. Sonia! Sonia? Yes, what is it? We've found a part for you in the movie. Really? Yes, of course. Here, it's this scene. What does that mean? It's a scene from the past. Right, okay. "Raymond's house, inside a bedroom. "A young woman finishes getting dressed in the bathroom. "From the bedroom, we can hear the voice "of Raymond's Moroccan houseboy. Enjoy, ladies and gentleman! Thanks, Ahmed. Leaving so soon? My friends should be coming to pick me up any minute. Won't you have breakfast with us? No, I really am late. That'll be them! She doesn't like us anymore. Have you seen my belt? Yes, I have! I've got a terrible hangover this morning. Are you really going to leave us like this? -Goodbye, Marthe. -Bye. Call us in Paris, OK? I promise. Bye bye. Funny thing, isn't she? Sure. You don't regret it? No. It was so nice and simple. I didn't know you liked women. Don't worry, I don't. I'd never have guessed. Idiot. I love you. Well, I can't be the only one, after that. No, I just wanted to see what it'd be like. I've done it before, with other couples. A single girl with a free spirit is often in high demand. I always thought I'd never like to be in the wife's place. Now here I am. And? You never needed any of that to make love to me before. Let's not overreact. I'm not overreacting, just stating facts. You could always see her again while I'm in Mégève. I'm not interested if you're not there. You could arrange to come with me. I don't like being away from you. Listen, you know that's impossible. It's a bad time, just as it always is in this industry. I've been offered a big movie, as first assistant director. The director's a really interesting guy, too. That's never happened to me before. What if I didn't go? No, come on. I'm going to be so busy all the time. There's no point in you staying. BOULOGNE STUDIOS All right, move out of shot now. Let's go. Quiet, please! Quiet! Lights. -Camera! -Rolling. Action! Cut! Lights up. All right, take a break. Ah! Just at the right time. I have a spare moment. Let's go to my dressing room. Come on in. Take a seat. Would you like a drink? No, thank you, I'm fine. I am so thirsty today. -Sure? -Thanks, no. I think your screenplay's beautiful. -Really? -Yes. I like Marthe a lot. Do you know why? No. She's the exact opposite of me. I would never even dream of killing myself over a man. It would be a lot of fun playing a character like that. I know girls who went through the same thing… well, they attempted suicide. They failed, of course. Marthe doesn't fail. Yes, which is just wonderful. She goes all the way. She's wholeheartedly in love, a truly passionate woman. I'd play her very well. If I wasn't convinced of that, I wouldn't have offered you the role. That being said, there's still one thing that bothers me. What's that? I think it all happens a little too fast. A woman like Marthe wouldn't admit to being defeated so easily. She'd look for a way to get Philippe back. He heard her say very clearly on the phone that their relationship was over, so he decided to leave her. Isn't that enough? Yes, but that's what he tells the other woman. No, I think Marthe would want to find Philippe and have him say to her face that he no longer loves her. With the secret hope, of course, that he'd tell her otherwise. I've never tried to kill myself over a man, but I have been left. But instead, according to you, she's the one leaving him? I don't see it. I guarantee that wouldn't happen. That's precisely why it's so awful for him. That uncertainty from which he can never escape. If he had managed to talk to her, maybe he could have stopped her. Yes, perhaps, but that would be another movie entirely. It wouldn't be called "Marthe". It would be called "Philippe". And I want to play Marthe. When I'm in the car, at the end, at the edge of the pond, I'd need to find the strength from somewhere to turn the wheel, find the will to end it all. I wouldn't be able to do that if I hadn't seen Philippe, one last time, for his final explanation. I'm glad you identify so strongly with Marthe's character. Yes, of course, I want to be Marthe, but… You won't kill me that easily. Yes? Eva! Hi. Hi. We're not sure about the last shot. We need to start over. Oh, gosh. Simone, my wig, quickly! Take it down to the set. Don't forget my raincoat, either! I'll be right back. Will you think about what I said? We need to find a solution. See you later. All right, bye. Who's that girl? What girl? The girl you were on the phone with. Are you spying? No, not exactly. It was an accident. I can explain. I'm listening. It's the girl I met on the train that time you were in Mégève. I tried to tell you about her, but I couldn't… Why? Are you afraid of me? Did you cheat on me a lot? Did you? Loads of times. With every station guard I could find. Well, I met this amazing girl on the train on my way home from location scouting. Oh, really? All aboard, doors closing. This train is ready to depart. Excuse me, Miss, are these seats taken? I beg your pardon, would you mind if I smoked? Would you like one? You don't smoke. Mind you, you're right not to smoke. My doctor forbids it, you know. I'm just so weak-willed. Sorry to bother you again, but what are you reading? It looks interesting. May I? Ah, Vailland. Fascinating. Fascinating, and a little daring, isn't it? Have you read Dangerous Liaisons? Lunch is served! Lunch is served. Are you coming? Me? Sure. Ah, finally. -How's it going? -Very well, thanks. I have big news. I've found someone to take on the role of Hélène. Who? Kate! Well, it's his call, you know. I did warn him, I'm no actress. Is Samy okay with this? Of course, he trusts me. Let's drink to that! What'll you have? Well, I'm starving, so I'd love some dinner. -Okay, let's go. Barman! -No, leave it. How did your movie hold up? I loved it. You haven't made a better one since. Wait until you see the next one. You must be delighted! -And Venice? -Fine. -Did you know? -Yes! Did you all go to St. Léger? Ah, so that's your house? I actually wanted to ask if we could film there. Absolutely, as long as you don't ruin the place. Shall we take both cars? Will you be joining us, Kate? I've always dreamed of being chauffeur to a star. Are you sure about this? Yes, why? Well, what do you think of her? Not bad, but still, I'd be careful. Can you imagine her opposite Eva? She'll be eaten alive! They're never together. It doesn't matter. It could ruin the movie. No, not at all. On the contrary. Opposite a Marthe who's very sure of herself, I need a simple, young, even awkward Hélène. That's my point. Still, we should do some tests. Love is the best thing we can do So why deprive ourselves? Something's happening between us two So let's go somewhere by ourselves All bets are off, no more taboos We're in private now From my head to my toes This feeling only grows Let's show each other how To make love in private now Love in private now Love is the best thing we can do So why deprive ourselves? I love you, you love me too Say it in private now All bets are off, and so are our shoes We're in private now From toes up to my head Kiss me everywhere, I said Let's show each other how And make love in private now Love in private now Where are you headed? Rue de Verneuil. What about you? Rue de Verneuil. Driver, Rue de Verneuil. Very good, sir. All right, well, goodbye. Goodbye, and thank you. Aren't you getting back in the cab? No, it's not worth it. I live right next door, on Rue Bonaparte. Oh, really? Then I'll definitely see you around. I'm not so sure. You can come upstairs, if you like. Would you like that? I have a very annoying concierge, so you'll have to duck as you pass. Why? Aren't you old enough? I'm renting the apartment from some friends of my parents. Who's that? It's me, Mrs. Bordier. -Well done. -Shh! Seven thirty? -Did you see Eva? -Yes. What did she say? There's something missing in the script to explain Marthe's suicide. Oh, really? Like what? She wants a real break-up scene between Marthe and Philippe. Did you agree to that? No, I can't. It never happened. I've regretted it enough. Did you tell her it's a true story? No. I didn't want to talk about it. So, what are you going to do? Wait and see. That being said, she's not completely wrong. Talking to her, I realized that I don't know anything about what happened that night. All I know is what Madeleine told me. Psychologically, perhaps it's not enough to explain her suicide. Did you tell her that Kate is going to play Hélène? No, I'm waiting for the tests. It makes me feel so strange to think that… You're going to make Kate do everything I did with you. You'll give her all my mannerisms, make her say all my words. You'll ask Philippe to kiss her the way you kissed me. That's right, I turned off the meter. Wait a minute. Is it working? No. I don't understand. It should be working. Where are you? Basically… You're replacing me with Kate, the way you replaced Marthe with me, ten years ago. It makes sense because I'm almost the same age as Marthe was now. What are you talking about? I'm anxious. It's a little overwhelming. I don't know how all of this will turn out. Well, I can't wait to see Philippe and Kate together. I hope they make a plausible couple. Who do you normally make love to? You. What about us? What about us? Do we make a plausible couple? Yes, I think so. What's the matter with you tonight? I love you very much, you know. Me, too. I don't even sleep with her anymore. Well, you're making both of us unhappy! I'm wasting my life waiting. I'm drying up. Meanwhile, you're unhappy too. You can't even work, you're feeling so sorry for yourself. It's such a shame. I promise it'll be sorted by the end of the year. I don't believe you anymore. Cut. Very good! Let's go for a wider shot now, more like that. That was really good, Kate. You're just saying that. Why would I say it if I didn't mean it? You did really well. Back up a little, please. -Excuse me. -Does this work? All right, move out of shot, please. A little further. Maurice! Thank you. A little more. There we go. Are we ready? Can we begin? When you're ready. Come on, hurry up. Did you plug that on purpose? I can't see. Ready, Kate? Camera. Rolling. TEST 3 KATE: SILENT That'll do. Bring me back in. Nice job, well done! Are you really going to drive a car in there? Yes, that's the end of the movie. What's a Traction Avant? A Citroën. You used to see a lot of cars like that at the time. You're too young. I wanted to ask you about the story. Did it really happen to you? No, come on, now. I'm glad to hear it. Why? I don't think this Philippe is a good guy. Oh, really? He's despicable. The way he behaves with Hélène… What about her? She barely knows him and can't wait to get her hands on him. Say… Who took these photographs? Huh? Which photographs? These ones here. Oh, those? They're by an artist friend of mine. A male friend? Well, what do you think, seeing as you're in the industry? For a friend, he understands your body well. What exactly has he understood? He understands… He understands these… And he understands this. And then he understands… Ouch! I adore you. Come on, now. I know you can't get enough of my cornflakes. Well, you know… I promise I'll buy groceries tonight. You've been saying that for three days. You never let me out. Hélène! Hélène, are you there? -Who's that? -Hélène! If she's really in love with him, I understand her perfectly. Good, that'll help you with the role. All right. Let's not talk about it anymore. It was him that took the photographs. Yes, but he thinks you're not home. He'll be back. I'll write to him and tell him not to bother. I already explained everything to you. I don't want to rush into anything. I don't want to sleep with that guy anymore. That's my business, isn't it? You don't love her anymore, yet you're still with her. What about me? You know you're the only one for me. I know. For a few hours a week. I don't even sleep with her anymore. Well, you're making both of us unhappy! I spend my life waiting for you. I'm drying up. Meanwhile, you're unhappy too. You can't even work, you're feeling so sorry for yourself. It's such a shame. I promise it'll be sorted by the end of the year. I don't believe you anymore. Cut! She's perfect. What do you think? Yes, I think she's excellent. Again, it doesn't concern me. Denis is the director. Well, I've made up my mind. Camille? What do you think? Me? I think she's great. I think they want us out. I have to leave, anyway. I have an appointment with a buyer. -You'll see… -Bye. -We're going to make a fantastic film. -I hope so. Ah, hello, Françoise! How are you? -Hi! -Here for your rushes? Yes, when do you start? -In two weeks. See you later. -Bye. PONTHIEU THEATER I hope Denis isn't too mad at me? No, why would he? About the ending. Did he tell you? I need to talk to you, actually. He's looking at it from a male perspective, but as a woman, it's just not believable. If you were Marthe, would you just go and kill yourself like that, without even defending yourself? I thought about it. I don't want Philippe to see Marthe. The audience won't go for it. Maybe there's another solution. I want the two women to meet on New Year's Eve. A pretty violent scene between the both of them. Hélène takes Marthe aside and reveals all the intimate details of her affair with Philippe. Marthe is completely devastated. By the end, she leaves, knowing that there's nothing more she can do. The two women… that's not a bad idea. I'm sorry, I'm late. I have to run. Right, goodbye! See you soon! Yes, if Marthe sees Hélène, if they come face to face, the living proof of her defeat… This dazzling young girl… Hey, I'm not that much older. No, but seriously, do you think that's stronger? Yes, but it's a lot of hassle, isn't it? In the current screenplay, Hélène doesn't go to a New Year's Eve party. What shall we do, then? Do you really want to go to that thing? No, not really. What if we go to Jean-Michel's place? Isn't it a little early? Where are you off to? Do you want a ride? We have our own, thanks. Come on, let's get going. All right, fine. Happy New Year! What's with all the photos? It's basically your house. It's for the film. I like to plan my shots precisely. How will you manage? It's meant to be New Year's and you're filming in July. All nights look the same. We'll put fake frost on the windows. Who's playing me? Don't worry, he's a real handsome guy. He's great, very ladylike. Just your type. My dear friends, I apologize for interrupting you, but the time is near. The year will end in just a few seconds! Watch out, I'm starting the countdown! Just ten seconds left! Hello, Eric? I don't understand your story. Why do you want to go? -To see her and explain myself. -I'm sure she already understands. -I can't leave her like this. -Is there a better way? It's better to get it over with fast. No, that's too heartless. If she sees you again, it'll give her false hope. Maybe that's what you want, though. Don't be stupid. Anyway… I know nothing I say will change your mind. Look after the keys. And be careful, it's slippery out. She's no Ferrari. Thank you. New Year's Eve is never a good time. Remember Algiers? It's lucky you were there. Am I not always there? -Bye, Eric. -Bye. It's funny, you know. I knew that, one day, you'd make a movie out of this story. How come? I don't know. I get the feeling you've always regretted that period of your life. A little, yes. Nothing has really happened to me since Marthe. Life with Camille is pretty uneventful. Plus, it was time to make something personal. Don't you think there are more important subjects than small, intimate tragedies? Bigger things are going on in the world. That's rich coming from you with your second home, Swiss bank accounts, a wife, mistresses, a swimming pool… Go get the ball! Come on! Quick! Her whole "look but don't touch" thing has me pretty excited. No, you mustn't do that! I hope I'm not making a mistake. Would you like some tea? Thank you. Does that mean yes or no? No, thanks. We need to get back. Kate! We're leaving. I have to go, buddy! Come on, kids. Did you get what you wanted? Yes, it's for the New Year's Eve sequence. Don't spoil anything! I want to be surprised at the first screening. Have you found an Isetta? There you are. I thought you had the flu. The flu? That's what Marthe said. We need to talk. What's the matter? Not here. Let's go to your office. Philippe's here. You see, there's nothing to worry about. He's back. But I don't want to see him. Not here. I'm leaving. I understand. You have to make a point. Are you feeling better? I don't know. I'm going home. That's ridiculous. Marthe is a marvelous woman and you're going to ruin your career. What's Marthe got to do with my career? You've become much more of a man since being with her. You told me that before, about Hélène. You need them both. Perhaps, but they don't agree. It's a question of diplomacy. Do you want me to talk to Marthe? I'll tell her what you told me, that you had a fling with Hélène, you're waiting for the right time. That's what I told Hélène about Marthe. And she believed you, right? Marthe's gone. There you go. -Goodbye! -Bye! Hey, what are you up to tomorrow? -Tomorrow? -Yes. We need to start working on the script. Come upstairs, if you like. Would you like me to? I have a very annoying concierge, so you'll have to duck as you pass. You already know that scene by heart? All right, why not? I'm curious to see where you live. It's that one! This could actually work pretty well for Hélène's room. Without all this Afghan stuff. There's a terrace! Would you like something to drink? No, thanks. I'm fine. Do you want to carry on the scene? I'm not Philippe's age anymore. Too bad. Is Camille jealous? I don't know. I don't think so. You know Eric likes you a lot? I know. He told me. Did he, now? What about you? Do you like me a lot? Kate? Kate! Go on, open the door. Honestly! So, you're the taxi? All right, goodbye. Ciao. We shouldn't keep people like this. With artists, it's hardly surprising. Will you sign this, please? Who's going to pay for all this? Hold on, there's someone here. Ah, there you are, Mr. Mallet! What a story! What's going on? Luckily the neighbor smelled it. Smelled what? The gas! She had the burners and the oven on. What? HOSPITAL Excuse me, Doctor. Room 357? At the end of the hall, on your right. PRIVATE ROOMS She's doing better now. She's sleeping. They gave her an injection. I'll leave you alone. I'll wait outside. How did you know? I called you this afternoon, but you weren't home. She answered the phone. She was very nervous. Then she started calling me Marthe. She said we shouldn't make the movie, that she didn't want me to kill myself. I asked her if she'd been drinking, and she hung up. I was worried. I called again, but there was no answer. I hailed a cab, but by the time I arrived the ambulance was already there. What on earth happened? Has this ever happened before? No, it's the first time. I don't understand. She seemed very afraid of something… I don't know. Can I do anything? I'm going to stay here and wait for her to wake up. Thank you for coming. Well, keep me updated. I will. The main thing is that she got out okay. Oh, Eva… Yes? I don't even know what I wanted to say. Oh, yes, about the dresses… Fitting, tomorrow, 3:00, Chanel. Oh, there's no rush. No, but we start filming in two weeks. So, I'll be there. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. I'm thirsty. What happened? You know what happened. You fainted. I fainted? Oh, yes. It's over now. Where are we? At the hospital. Don't worry. Everything will be better tomorrow. You'll be able to come home. My poor Denis. What a story. What happened? I couldn't tell you. I just couldn't. What? It's my fault that Marthe killed herself. I've always hidden it from you. But Eva knew that something was wrong. She didn't understand anything on the phone. You, too, were circling around the truth. You were about to find everything out, and I couldn't bear it. Find what out? I saw Marthe that New Year's Eve. After I went to the movies with Colette, we ended up going to Jean-Michel's. He was the one that drove me there. You go ahead in front and see how it looks. But I don't know anyone there. Take Philippe aside and tell him that I'm here, waiting for him. I've only seen him once. Go on, go! You've got some nerve, you know. Philippe's here. You see, there's nothing to worry about. He's back. I don't want to see him, not here. I'm leaving. You're Marthe. I'm Hélène. I'm sorry to approach you like this. I wanted to talk to you about Philippe. I know you live with him. Me too. I met him while you were away in Mégève. He keeps telling me he wants to live with me, that he'll talk to you… He promised me it would be before the end of the year. But then… nothing. I've had enough. This can't go on. I'd prefer that you knew, and that we make a decision. It's either you or me. Tell him I'm going back to Paris. If he doesn't come for me in an hour, I'll kill myself. You're insane! I think he's alone. Over there, in a corner. Did you speak to him? No, I think you can go in. I've changed my mind. Let's get out of here. Whatever you say. Why didn't you tell me? I was afraid of losing you. I thought that, if you saw her again, you'd never leave her. I'd already left her. My things were at your's. But I didn't know that until the next morning. Yet you kept quiet. I thought that, if I told you the truth, you wouldn't want me anymore. Besides… We were finally living together. I tried to forget about it. But I couldn't, not really. And… When I read the screenplay, it all rose back up to the surface. It was horrible. What are you going to do now? Make the movie. What about me? You're going to help me. You've already begun by telling me the missing scene. I thought I was the only one who needed to forget Marthe. We both do. You're not to blame. Listen, I'm the one that left her, aren't I? The one who lied to her for months? What would have happened if I told you she wanted to see you? I would have gone, but nothing would have changed. I would never have given in. That kind of emotional blackmail is despicable. And you almost died, too. I understand why there were so many questions at the time of the report. They wondered why the car was coming from Paris. But everything is clear now. Very clear. After I met you… After meeting Hélène, Marthe returns to Paris. She arrives home on Rue Bonaparte… The keys to the apartment are lying there, in plain sight, on a table in the entrance hall. So, it is true. He's leaving her. But after what she said to Hélène, she still waits for a telephone call… A sign… An explanation… Something that will bring him back to her. Nothing. She doesn't care anymore. She gets in the car and heads back to Raymond's place. As she passes the pond… Cut! All right. Put the Cameflex on the riser. -Was that okay? -It was perfect. Very good. Do you want me to do another one, less suicide, more accident? To leave it more open-ended? No, why? It's a suicide! You don't want to do another take? No way. We have two great takes. I'll choose between them. All right. You're done. Get some rest, tomorrow will be a long day. Yes. What are you doing now? Throwing the car in. Can I watch? I'm curious. -Denis! -Yes, I'm coming! -Excuse me. -Thanks. Did everything go well? Denis looks happy. -Are you? -What do you think? When I was in the car, I thought about your face in the hospital. That can't have been a pretty sight. I tried to imagine what was going through your head, before… That helped me a lot. Do you like your stunt double? If you think she looks like me… Through the windscreen and the fog, she does! Come on, quick! You have to lay the cable. It's inside. This cable here? All right, stand back. You can go for it. Turn up the lights, please. I can't watch. It's just a movie. The movies scare me. I always think they're real life. Quiet, please! Start the fog! Camera. Rolling. Marthe, 460, take one. Car! Should we cut? Yes, cut. Subtitle translation by: Rebecca Schofield
