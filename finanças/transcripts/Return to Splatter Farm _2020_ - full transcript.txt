- This is it. Here, hold the flashlight. Whoa. We're in. - Oh yeah, whoa, we're in. A barn. What? It's an old barn. Do you really expect me to get excited about this? - Come on, babe. This is where it all happened. Those murders back in the 80s. Corpses and body parts everywhere. And they never found the killer. - And I suppose we're the first ones to set foot in here ever since. - You know what, Penny? You can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. Look, we'll have a quick look around, and if we don't find anything cool, we can leave. Okay? - Fine, Rod. If it gets it out of your system... I suppose you want to climb up there and check it out? - You said it. Not! That's obviously rotted wood. What do you think I am, stupid? Let's just go check out the house. - Okay. The inside of this place is disgusting too. - What do you expect? No one's been here in decades. - Well, I suppose they don't get Wi-Fi here. Wait, point it back in that direction. I thought you said this place was abandoned. Someone's been here. - It was probably just a drifter off the street who needed a place to stay and stayed here and then left. - Why didn't they dust off the couch and sleep there? - Beats me. - I don't like this. Maybe we should go. - Let's just look around a little longer. - Oh my God. What was that? Where'd it come from? - I don't know. It was probably nothing. Let's just go upstairs. - I don't think so. I'm leaving right now! - Ah, screw it, I'm gone too. Babe? Babe? Crap! Come on. - Jeez, Brad! Take it easy on the pedal! Like, look what you made me do! - Classic. - Yeah, well, laugh it up, you big dumb jock. - Whatever, man. Is everyone all right back there? Did everyone survive the curb? - Yeah, I'm fine. You big dumb, jock. - Ladies? - Me? I'm good. My makeup doesn't smear. - Bobbi? Hey Bobbi, Earth to Bobbi. - What? - I was asking if you were all right, I guess so. - Oh no, I'm fine. Hey, I think we're only a few miles from the farm now. - Good, 'cause I'm tired of driving, and we need to get some more gas too. - Oh, and we need more beer, that's for sure. ♪ Daphne the booze hound ♪ - Why don't you just stick to your makeup, Barbie. - Well, it looks like everything we need to drive is over here. - Didn't you hear me? I said I'll only be a minute. - I'll come in too. - I'm only going in to pick up a couple of things, and I'll be right out. No need to get out of the car. - Cliff. We go through the same routine every time. You wind up fiddling around in there for like 20 minutes, and I wind up sitting in a hot car. Not today. - Every time we go in there, you end up wandering off. - I do not! You're being silly, Ha, serves you right! Why don't you fix that? - I did fix it. - Fine job you did. - Will you stop nagging? - What is all that stuff you keep shoving in there anyways? Ropes, knives, camping gear, a moose gun. What are we survivalist in the Outback? - It's an army issue flare gun. Just goes to show what you know. - Dude. Did you see that woman in the parking lot? - Oh yeah. - Now that is what I call a MILF, ugh. - Bro. The very definition. - But how does a guy like him end up with a fine piece like her? I don't get it. - No surprise. You never get it. - Yeah, real funny, dude. - Bro, how do you think? It's the money, the green, the moola. - Oh yeah. - Hey there, pretty lady. What you thinkin' of buying? - I'm just looking. We're not gonna be here long. We just came to pick up gas and booze. - Booze, huh? Why not just buy some beer right now? We can hang out for a while. - You don't waste any time, do you? - The name's Josh. - Well, Josh, I'm here with my boyfriend, so... - So, I don't see him around. So, what do you say? - He's like, just down one of these aisles, so... Beat it. - Now that ain't a friendly way to talk. - I said beat it. - Hey, this guy bothering you? - Josh here was just leaving. - Good for him. - Me and the lady were just having a conversation, sport-o. - Hey man, get lost. - Care to repeat that? - I said get lost, grease monkey. You're lucky. Come on, baby. - See ya, sport-o. - So you mean to tell me you really own that old place? - Yeah, that's right. - That's some inheritance. - What do you mean? - Nothing, nothing. I mean, well, I just can't picture a young girl like you living in that old farmhouse, all isolated out in the middle of nowhere. - Well, I haven't decided if I'm going to move there. I'm just going out there a few days to check it out. - Excuse me. Did I hear you say you're heading out to that old farmhouse down the road a piece? - Yeah, that's right. - And you own that now? - Right again. - You wouldn't happen to have any proof on that, would you? I know, it's an odd question, but... - Is something going on up here? Is there a problem? I mean, we have ID. - No, no problem. Just get concerned when people get roaming around at that old place. Lots of broken glass and rusty nails lying around. You know? - I hope we all have our shots. - Yeah, well. You guys take care, have a good day. - Well, that was weird. - I'll go pump the gas. - You can't go out there. That's the death farm. - What? - I just said- - Don't bother those kids with your nonsense. - I was just telling her- - Not another word. - That sheriff was acting weird, don't you think? - What sheriff? - The local sheriff wanted proof Bobbi owned the place. - What? That's weird. Hey guys, speaking of weird, there was this chick at the store that said we shouldn't go to the farm. She called it the "death farm". Does anybody know what she's talking about? - Hey Bobbi, you got no idea what's going on? - Um, okay. Well... There was some people murdered there 30 years ago. It was the woman that owned the place and a couple of her nephews. - And what, you like didn't think to mention this before we left? - I'm sorry. I didn't want to freak you guys out, and it was so long ago. - Wait. The woman who owned the place? So like, you're related to her? - Yeah, but not closely. I mean, I never even met her. - Well, I like it. The Death Farm. Now that's retro. - Yeah, I definitely want to drink there. - You want to drink anywhere. - Wow. It certainly looks old. - Hey, what's up with this? - Let me guess, no signal. - Yeah, like, how did you know? - Babe, we're in the middle of nowhere, of course there's no signal. - Well, that sucks. - Don't feel bad, I lost mine miles ago. - Yeah, same here. - Gopher, didn't you just hear what I told... - Wait for it. Wait for it. Ha, full bars! In your face, and in your face, and in your face, and in your face. - Let's go check out the house. - What a dick. - Yup. It's old on the inside too. - I don't know, I think it's homey. You know, in like, an American Gothic kind of way. - Let's check upstairs. Hey, we got electricity And running water. - Oh, bummer. I was like, so looking forward to roughing it. That was a joke. - Okay, so since this is like the best room so far, me and Brad call dibs. - Sure. You are my guests after all. - Let me try, maybe it's just stuck. It's like there's a brick wall or something behind this door. Looks like no one's sleeping in here tonight. - All right, well, let's just head back downstairs, we'll figure it out later. Well, since this is the only other accessible bedroom tonight, I guess this is just gonna be us girls bunking in here. What do you say, Daph? - Works for me. Hey, Retro Boy. How's that couch treating you? - It's all right. Hey, where's my bedroom? You know, it sucks to be the odd man out. - What a bitch. - I went into the barn to look around, but it was gettin' too dark, so I definitely want to get in there tomorrow to see what's there. - Bobbi. There's plenty of time for that. What you need is to unwind after a long day. Here, have a drink. - Okay, maybe just one. - There you go. So, tell me, do you really know more about that murder story in this place? - I researched it a little bit before we came here, and apparently they suspected another relative that did yard work. One newspaper said that he got questioned, and another said that he disappeared. - Well, who was he? - Some young guy named Jeremy. I think he had mental problems. - So, he could have done it? - I don't know. I could not find anything else more about it. - So he could still be lurking in the shadows after all these years? - Yeah, I think you've had too much to drink. Yeah, probably. Oh, yeah. Mm, mm, yeah. Oh, Brad! - I'm the big, dumb jock with an airhead girlfriend. Life is so not fair. - Welcome to the farm. We can be friends. - Oh, man. It's already noon. Almost half the day is over. - I made some coffee and toast if you want any. - Thanks. I could definitely use the coffee. - You know, you might want to cut back on the drinking. Just a little. - Listen, if I wanted my mother here, I would have invited her. I came to get away from all that for a couple days. - I'm sorry, you're right. I gotta stop telling people what I think is best for them. - No, you're right. You've always been the responsible one. Where's everybody else? - Out lounging in the sun. - Well, I wouldn't count on much help from them in surveying the place. - Yeah, I want to look around today. I want to go through the fields and see where the property line ends. - You feel like having some company? - Sure. - Wow. These fields go on forever. We've been walking for like 20 minutes already. - I know. And we're not even close to the property line yet. - Really? I think you may have some money on your hands with this place. - Maybe. - Looks like somebody set up camp here quite a awhile ago. - Why would anybody just leave their stuff here? - Beats me. More campers? - Well, this is it, this is the end of the property line here. - Yeah, but what's that? It could be a dead animal killed by the person wearing that hat? - You really think so? - I don't know, I'm just a city girl. - Well, we should probably start heading back before it gets dark. - Yeah. It's a long walk. I need a drink. - I'm gonna go cut some wood. - All right, but hurry back, okay? - All right. - Damn thing, God damn it. Go in. - Hey. - Hey there. - Didn't I see you in the parking lot of that store yesterday? - Well now, isn't that a silly question? You know you did. - I'm Gopher. - Gopher? Well, isn't that the cutest name? Like the furry little animal. - So, what can I do for you? - Gina. I just came by to welcome you guys to the neighborhood. So to speak. - Cool. - Are your friends here? - Friends? Uh, oh yeah, I have those. Friends. Yeah, they're inside, probably. I can introduce you. Hey guys, this is Gina. She came to welcome us to the neighborhood. - Oh, hey, I'm Brad, this is Liz. - Oh right, I saw you guys going into the store yesterday, remember? - No, I don't think so. Sorry. - It's okay. I definitely remember you. - So, do you live around here? - Down the road a ways. It's not often that we get visitors in these parts. - Oh yeah, we're here for our friend Bobbi. She owns the land now. Oh, isn't that something? She owns all of this? - Yeah, it's hard to believe, isn't it? - If you want, I can show you around the place. I mean, it's a super nice night for a walk. - No, I should probably get going. But thanks. Another time perhaps? - I'm sure your husband is missing you already. - I doubt that. But sure was nice meeting you kids. - Oh, well, now where are my manners? We haven't even offered you anything. How about a cup of coffee before you go? - No, I'm fine. Thanks. - After all that night driving and the ride home? At least have a cup before you go. - It's okay. I'm fine. - Yeah, she's right. Have something before you go. - Oh, well, maybe just one cup. Thanks. So Brad, do you play football? You look like a young man who'd play football. - Um, yeah. Actually I play college ball. Hoping to go pro next year. - Wow, isn't that exciting? I find football to be... - Oh my goodness. I'm like so sorry. How could I have been so clumsy? Here, let me get you something to clean that up. Here, let me help you. - No, I'll do it. - I'm sure that'll come off in the wash as soon as you get home. - Where's your bathroom? - Here, I'll show you. It's actually right upstair- - I'm sure she can find it herself, Brad, - I'm gonna go back outside. - You know what? I think I'm going outside too. For a walk. Alone. - Chicks are a real pain in the ass. - Ah, screw it. - Just great. That bitch! Hm. Mine now, bitch. Try to say something about it. - Brad? Is that you? Brad? If that's you goofing off, you can stop it. I'm pissed off enough already. - I can't believe we're not back yet. You have a massive amount of property here. - I know. Well, we're almost back. I'm glad too, 'cause I'm getting tired. Come on. - Crap! Josh? What are you doing all the way out here? - I just came to see you. - Really? You came out here? You don't give up, do you? - It's just the way I roll, babe. - Pretty cocky for a grease monkey. - Bitch! - Hey, let's go in the barn. - Yeah, up yours, jock-o! - Shut the hell up. - We go good together. - What was that? - What was what? - I heard a sound, like wood cracking. - It was nothing. I get it. The jock-o's sneaking around the barn, afraid to face me. Come on out! - Brad? - That's what I thought, you wimp. All talk. Well, keep hiding, and watch as your girlfriend does me. Check this out. - You asshole! If you think I'm gonna blow you, like this quick, you're crazy. Brad, are you really... - Hello? Is somebody out there? Aw, come on. One of you boys out there trying to get a little peep? Come on and show yourself, don't be shy. I may even give you a little quick peek. Brad, is that you? Snuck away from your bitch girlfriend, did you? - Aw crap, dead batteries. All right. Where are those batteries? I know they're in here somewhere. Well, boombox it is. Oh, an awesome storm's coming. Almost. Wait for it. Wait for it. Got it. Kicking it old school. Hey, is somebody out there? - Do you know whose car that was out there? No, but I'm sure we'll find out. - Hey guys, we're back! Is anybody there? - Maybe they're out back? - Yeah, probably. I'm gonna go change. - All right. I'm gonna go grab some beers and then head out back. Okay. I'll see you in a bit. - All right. Gopher? Hey, Gopher. Where you at? I brought you a beer. Well, screw it then. More for me. Who are you? Hey. Hey. Hey, don't, don't. - All right buddy, into the tank. - This is police brutality! - Yeah, yeah, buddy. You sleep it off. - Okay, Sheriff. I'll see you in the morning. - Sheriff's office. Deputy Langley speaking. - Sheriff Jordan. Oh, hey, Cliff. What? Missing? Well, how long she been gone? Look, Cliff, you know I can't file a missing person's report yet. Four hours is hardly very long. Yeah, look I know, but it's only been... Okay, okay, all right. I'm gonna be leaving here shortly. I'll take a swing out there. Yeah. Yeah, all right. I'll let you know. Okay. Yeah, you're welcome. Bye, Cliff. - What did Cliff want? Who's missing? - Gina. - Yeah, but she's only been gone four hours. - Yeah, but he's worried about her. - About his wife or that car with all that shit in it? - Probably equal parts on both. She took a ride out to the old farmhouse at the end of the Johnson Road. - Why the hell would she go way out there for? - A bunch of young people moved in out there. Two guys and three girls. - Yeah, young guys. That's why Gina hasn't been back yet. - Yeah, yeah, well... All I know is it means a long ride for what I'm sure was nothing. Although... Something wrong, Sheriff? - Eh, no. It's just that place has a bad history is all. And that stuff... That can wait 'til tomorrow. - Sheriff Jordan. - Yeah? - Why do they call the place Splatter Farm? - Well, when I was a kid, my dad was the county coroner in these parts. I went on the call with him out to the farmhouse, 30 some years ago. He made me stay in the car, but being the kid I had to get out, look around. I wish I had listened to him. That place was a slaughter house. - Sorry, I thought they were all rumors, you know? Local folklore. - No, all true. Worse than true, to be honest. Nobody knows for certain what happened out there, but over the years, I've pieced it together. Well, as far as I can reckon. - And? - A set of twins were visiting their Aunt Lacy for the summer. She was an odd old bird. She had a handyman, Jeremy. A relative. I don't know, but I believe he was the one that did the killing. - Some idea of yours, spending the summer with old bag Lacy. - That's Aunt Lacy. She's just lonely and needs the company. - I think she's strange. And that Jeremy, I don't trust him either. - Oh, it's all in your head. - I went outside, found this on the farm boundary. There's a modified head in here! - Then tonight, when everyone's asleep, we go outside and do our own checking around. - It's about time we get to the bottom of this. - Exactly. You'll do anything I ask. Anything. - Jeremy! Get out here, you bastard. You know I'm not afraid of you. - Jeremy? What have you found to my brother? - They found pieces of what we believe were the twins, Aunt Lacy, all over the lawn. And Jeremy was nowhere to be found. Under the house and in the barn, dozens of bodies. Victims of the killer. - Now I know how it earned its name. - Hey guys, is anyone up there? Did someone leave the faucet on? Hey, is anyone in there? Is everything all right? No, no, no, no, no. Come on! Jeremy? - We can be friends. - No. Stay away from me! - Maybe later. - No, no! Get away from me! Get away! - Hello? Hello? It's Sheriff Jordan. Anybody in here? Hello? Anybody up here? My God. - Help! - Stop! Hey, stop! - Help! - Damn! - Help! - Sheriff Jordan to station.
