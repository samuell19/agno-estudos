The most powerful of these colonies, Massachusetts, was also the most intolerant, fanatical. This film relates a true story that took place in Salem, Massachusetts, in I692. Give me the poppet. It's the one Pupu brought me yesterday. It's the Lord's Day, Fancy. Grownups are forbid to work and children to play. God is watching. Would you bring down His wrath? And give me the wrap. Fancy, what have you? Fancy... There my beauty, my little one. My poppet, Pupu. My poppet. Can't she have it for a moment? Look, here is what we do. Mama will take out the poppet and put it on the dresser. You shall sit here and say your prayers until we go to Temple. But you can look at it. Sneak the odd look. Out of the corner of your eye. Sit up straight. Mary! ' Mary! ' Aye? The soup. I think you're angry with me. Fancy is afraid of you. I don't like that. Should I let her play on the Sabbath? Do you know why she fears me? Because you are always right. You work on Sundays? Be gone! You're always seeking me, and when you find me you flee from me. I seek you not. Be gone! Tell me that once more, just once and I'll be gone. - Witch. - Not so loud, or I'll be hanged. It's what you deserve. You are my temptress. You know that's a lie, Mister Proctor. I'm 17 years old. Your desire entered into me. Your lust became my desire. You desire me? All the time. Let me pass or I'll strike you. Your hands were around my waist! You want to crush me? Don't be afraid. Touching me will drain your will. Don't you remember? Saying you loved my caresses, that you never knew the like before. You shun't tempt me, I won't be an adulterer! You've lain with me twice, in this place. I hadn't touched a woman for seven months. The beast within me desired you, not I. But I will purge my soul. And if I be consumed with remorse, will it make me a virgin again? My God! Keep me from this evil. Down on your knees! God will never forgive you. Proctor! John Proctor! Did you cull my husband, Abigail? Mister Proctor forgot his hat. Then give it to me. I will bring it to him. Pardon, ma'am. Go and get ready, Abigail. It's a sin to arrive late to worship. John! It's time for church! John, are you mad? Working on the Sabbath! You must be daft! It's the Lord's Day. Work helps calm my anger. If 'tis calm you want, come pray in church. Last time, Parris ruttled on about land and mortgages, it was like an auction. I have plowed on Sunday, so I won't cast the first stone. But you are our only representative against the rich. If they hear you worked during the holy service they will exclude you and we shall be represented no more. Am I worthy to speak for you? We trust you. In this savage land no man trusts another. Go pray without me. - We'll pray for you. - As you will. Good day. Will you not come to service? Are you so guilty that you fear to enter the church? Were I a criminal, I should not fear to go before God, for I tell you this, He is surely more merciful than you. Gilles! I'm coming with you! I will join you in Temple. You're mad. It's the pastor's house. Beware the whip. Who cast this stone? Who? What ails you? I have torn up my sermon. It was too gentle, by for. They seek my ruin, but fear not, I shall crush them. Prepare yourself for service, Betty. I don't want to go. I'm in pain. If you suffer, you are guilty. - What have you done? - Nothing, I swear it. God sends us pain to punish us for our sins. You have sinned, Betty. You are not sick. Go prepare yourself! Very well, Papa. They'll see what I'm like. I don't want to go to service. I hate the service. - What ails you? - I want Mama. - But your Mama be dead, darlin'. - Then I want to die too. Listen, honey. If you swear you won't tell nobody, I can maybe bring you back your Mama. My Mama who's buried? Aye. - I can talk to her? - Aye, if you like. Come. Arrogant Salem, Arrogant Salem, twice in 20 years you have so plagued your ministers that they chose to leave. And now you would begin again with me? I will not leave you. Without your minister to pray for your souls, what would you be in the eyes of the Lord? Mud and filth. I will not leave you, brethren. For human nature is depraved. And man left to his own devices turns always to evil. Your uncle is in a bad humor. If your souls were as visible as your faces, you would be horrified. They are covered with scabs, they stink. Each sin opens a new wound flowing with defiled black blood. Have you never seen spiders writhing in a flame? They try to flee but their legs buckle under. They blacken and shrivel up, then turn into a ball of fire. That is what awaits you. The human beast is ferocious. Only fear can keep him down. If you fear the Almighty, whom your minister represents... If your terror of Hell overcomes your base appetites... Enough! Reverend Parris, you fail in your duties. We come here to find God, you speak only of the Devil. People of Salem, hear this sacrilege. John Proctor, God will never forgive you for defiling His house. Mark what I say to you, this community must chop off its rotten limbs. Only thus can we fight for our God, our land and our country. You can flee Him hidden by fear and shame... - If I find the occasion... - Occasion? To bring down God's wrath upon these rebellious souls. - I have your support? - If the occasion is right. It shall be. I would that Salem had one head, so I might seize its throat and bend it to my feet. "Our Father who art in Heaven, "hallowed be Thy name. "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. "Amen." Good evening, Mistress Proctor. Good evening, Abigail. Good night, Mister Proctor. Mary, help Fancy to undress, please. Yes, ma'am. What ails you? Stay a while longer. I'm very tired, John. Good night. Singing is forbidden on the Sabbath! Elisabeth, will you help me? I'm your wife, John. I'll help you with all my soul. You're my companion, my sister, sometimes my mother, but for 7 months now, never my wife. I'm sick, John, you know it. Are you really sick? I never lie. Do you love me? I told you I'm your wife. I'm asking if you love me. You and Fancy are what I hold dearest in the world. But how can I help you? You'd help me if I felt you loved me. But I do love you, John. If you loved me, if I felt it occasionally... A woman can send a man to Hell in several ways. By contaminating him with vice, but also because she is overfond of virtue. Open the door, John. Tomorrow morning Gilles Corey will drive you to your Uncle Parris. Do you want me to go away? John! Mistress Proctor! You know he took my virginity? He may be faithful to you for 100 years, he debauched me nevertheless. Be gone. Right away. Since it's you who asks me. A word of advice, if you want to keep him, learn to caress him. - Like this. - Out, whore! You'll regret it, John. I swear it! I'll make you weep tears of blood. I couldn't lie any longer. I was waiting for this. I feel relief. Like on Judgment Day, when the eyes of God will penetrate my soul. You see me as I really am, Elisabeth. You know me now us well us God does. Are you looking at me? Do you forgive me a little? It's not for me to forgive you. God will judge you. Will He forgive me? Never. Unless you chase her from your heart, as I drove her from my house. I shall rip her out like a... Be careful, John. That woman wants me dead. Tonight, I must ask you not to sleep beside me. Will he love me? Aye. If you boil this, and drink the broth. And if he loves another? If he does, I'll give you this poppet. And you'll do away with your rival. Like this. What do you want, Sarah Good? Send her away. Be gone, your letter too. Give it to me. You've told no one? Mary! Tell my wile I'm going to Salem. Good day, Mister Proctor. I haven't seen you for 2 months. How is Mistress Proctor? Still sick in her belly? Is it true what you wrote me? You're pregnant? Three months gone. What are you going to do? If the child is born, don't count on me to drown it. I'm not pregnant, John. So why this lie? You swore to rip me from your heart. I wanted to see if you succeeded. Abie, forgive me as I forgive you, but expect nothing. Nothing? I see desire in your eyes. Desire, yes. Because the body is a wild beast. But I'll give into it no more. All desire holds a promise. Never fear, I won't try to tempt you anymore. You won't touch me before I'm Mistress Proctor. You'll never be Mistress Proctor. YES, you have to say that. But don't worry, I'll deal with it myself. You'll keep your hands clean. What will you do? Let me pass, I must find Betty. There's a full moon tonight, John. - It's nothing. A nosebleed. - Another one? Jane! Don't let your father see you. Jane, what is it? Nothing. They were playing. Come inside. Give me that handkerchief. Do you hear me? Again? All children have nosebleeds. Not four times a day. Ann, I can see you. You caught me! I don't want her taken from me. How did you anger God? Thomas! 6 children dead in 8 years, is it natural? Well then? Why should it be my fault? You're a sinner too. My father was the poorest, I'm the richest man in Salem. God has blessed my work. But He cursed your belly, woman. My children were murdered. You have enemies everywhere. I'm sure I was bewitched. Why did you send for that midwife? I saw my babes perish in her hands. I tell you... I tell you not to accuse. 'Twas your sins that killed them. Let me do your hair for you. Will you stay for supper? No. It's a full moon tonight. I'm going to see Mama. Your Mama is in Heaven. Yes, but I'll see her. But she's in Heaven. You cannot. I already have. Tituba showed her to me. Abigail was there, and Mercy. - Mercy, our servant? - She was there. Mama touched her ear and winked at me. No? A black butterfly! Ann... Would you like to see your brothers? My little brothers who are dead? You've seen her again? Yes, I've seen her. What did she want? It was not true, of course. You are a child. Going out, Mary? I'm off to see cousin June at Muster Corey's. At this hour of night? The farm is close by. And there's a full moon. - Go then, child. - Thank you, ma'am. Will I never again share your bed? I'll sleep on the floor, at the foot of your bed. You're not helping me. I try to swim, but you stand on my shoulders plunging me into the mud. What is she up to? She be dancin' with impatience. Go up. She'll give us away. I fell. It's what comes of dancing. Show your hands. Don't cry, my little one. I be here. - I don't want to. - What don't you want? I want my Mama. - Put her to bed, Tituba. - Aye, Master. I want my Mama. Where is Betty? Tituba! Abigail! - Why did you bring her? - Her mother sent her. I come to see my brothers. - You jabbered? - No, 'twas Betty. Little fool! And who told you to come? I want a love potion. For who? The son of Gilles Corey. Then beware, if you speak a word of what we do... I'll say nothing. I swear it. Eat! If you want Peter's love. You could eat that? I am loved, no need to eat boiled toad. I'll drink this. It's red. I drink the blood. I want someone dead. I will it. You be calm, my little ones. First you must dance. When Lord comes, you will all fly, you can eat and drink. Turn. Turn. Turn here. Turn there. The great Lord will come down. Call Baron Samedi, the Lord of the dead. Turn, Betty. Turn. Turn, dance. I can't. Be gone! Betty! - Your Mama, Betty! - Where? There! I don't believe your nonsense, but if my wife suffers, you'll pay. Betty! What ails you? - Is she sick? - Why is she out at this hour? Is she sick? What is she doing outside? Lift her to her bed. Doctor! Nathan, saddle your horse. Ride to Berkley. Find Reverend Hale and beg him to come. 'Tis urgent. Reverend Hale? A most weighty expert in demonic arts. - What is this? - What does it signify? Dark angels are afoot in Salem. See, their first and most innocent victim. For many months now, a dark power has turned her from me. There are witches here, people of Salem, and my child is in their power. Are you mad to speak of witchcraft? God bade me speak. God? More like the Devil. So be it, the Devil. We'll play him a trick. 'Tis the occasion to distinguish fair from foul. My daughter was in the forest and yours too. We are in this up to our necks. Us? Who will strike us? We are the inquisitors of God, not the accused. Are you afraid? Come see. Never have they so loved me. Witches walk in their midst. They know it. The good shall denounce the evil. Under our guiding hands, the village will cleanse itself. Salem will be purified. - Mistress Putnam, you've heard? - In an hour, everyone will know. Reverend Hale, what is your verdict? I don't know. What troubles me is that this child displays no signs... The eyes should be white. No! I will see no one. It's you. Excuse me, Mistress. But I told you... What did you tell me? Repeat it before Reverend Hale. This is my wife. I lost 6 children in 8 years. Six children? Six. All alive and healthy when I gave birth to them. People wanted to blame me, Reverend. They said it was God's punishment for my sins. They tried to disgust me with myself. But all is clear now. My dark night is over. My daughter is bewitched, as were my other 6 children. If you fail in your duty, she'll be killed too. I cannot conclude so fast. Hurry. The mothers of Salem demand it. The Devil is here, many children will die. You want the witch's name? I forbid you to name anyone. No accusations without proof. - It's Mistress... - Be quiet. Your children died of sickness. The Putnums are never sick. No, Reverend, never! Patience. It is all in the books. If Satan is amongst us, I'll crush him. You all think too much of the Devil. You'll end up forgetting God. There, my sweet. Gently. - Gently. - Mama... What did you do to her? Rebecca, I don't want anyone to hurt me. Don't be afraid. This child is in the Devil's power? If 'twas so, how could I calm her? Am I a witch? I was 11 times a mother, 26 times a grandmother. - I can recognize a sick child. - Sick? Sickness when a child wants to fly? She wants to fly? I restrained her 20 times. The proof of witchcraft! No, Mistress. I must warn you that I will do nothing unless you admit that I may not find a trace of Hell. We admit it, sir. We recognize our incompetence, we are in your hands. The Deputy Governor. Coming here! I had him informed, as is the custom. I never thought he'd come. It is so serious? We have no time to lose. - Your conclusions, Hole? - Your Honor, I have no... Conclude now and convoke the judges. Sir, in all honesty, I am not sure... In all honesty, I tell you this girl is bewitched. You know our country is in grave danger? The enemy is within, sir, in our own homes. The woe that befalls you is part of a vast conspiracy, stretching to Boston. Witches... Witches. Men with no morals, basely born, not fearing a pact with the Devil in order to seize power. This is our chance to unmask them. I do my duty, Hale. Massachusetts will not fall into their foul hands. Now do your duty. Interrogate the child. - Your Honor... - Do it now, in front of me. Excuse me, sir, I'm too old to watch this. She is Rebecca Nurse, a farmer's wife. Betty... Betty! Has someone harmed you? Betty, come now. Who is tormenting you? Tituba! Abigail wanted... Abigail drank... Tell them what you drunk! I'm here, Betty. Did Tituba harm you? - Who is Tituba? - My black slave. Bring her here. I want to fly away to Mama! Let me fly. Lay your hands on her. Quick! Betty, 'tis Tituba. Lay your hands on her. Betty! Betty, my darlin'. It's me, Tituba. Gently now. Gently. There. See the power of that woman. Negress, why do you torment her? She must be hanged, now! Give me my children back, witch! Abigail, tell them I never hurt Betty. - I did no wrong... - She led us into the forest. She made me drink... You begged me to evoke the spirits. You begged me to make potions to... No, I don't want to, Tituba! I won't go any more! No, Tituba! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! She is possessed. - Like Jefferson's wife. - Possessed by the Devil. It is appalling. - Appalling. - 'Tis the Devil. Lay your hands on her. Satan is amongst us. Why did you bewitch these children? I never bewitched anyone, sir. - Tituba, you saw the Devil. - Me? The Devil? Yes. Will you speak, darkie? Yes, sir. The Devil! He come at me and I try to run, to run away but he catch me. Was the Devil alone? - Was he alone? - Who was with him? - Who was with him? - Remember. Remember, Tituba. Did she tell you? She spoke of... the women of Salem. - Oh, Abigail. - Which women? Mister Reverend, it was dark. If you saw Satan, you saw witches. They run so fast... Tituba, you have sinned. But you will be pardoned if you help us drive out Satan. Look at God, Tituba, and answer us. Did you see witches? Answer! Aye! How many? How many of them? Four. - Four of them. - Their names? I saw... - Sarah Good. - Sarah Good? - And Mistress... - Mistress Simpson, the midwife. Mistress Simpson. I knew it. The others, Tituba. Who are the others? I can't, Mister Reverend. I can't see no more. Tituba, you have confessed. May God forgive you as He forgives them who repent and believe. There's no doubt now. Satan is in Salem with a coven of witches. Go for Judge Hathorne. Be blessed, Your Honor. 'Tis a miracle. A miracle, in truth. I heard that your faithful are stubborn. Never fear, I shall not leave Salem before I have tamed them. Is Satan really amongst us? Your sins opened the doors of Salem to him. Men of little faith, repent! God expects each one of you to point out the tainted at once. God of Vengeance, we swear to relinquish pity and rest until we have exterminated them. "Our Father Who art in Heaven. "Hallowed be Thy name. "Thy will be done "On earth us it is in Heaven. "Amen." Papa! Papa! Mama, stop! It's Papa. You'll fall out. I'm going to buy you a poppet. You're buying me a poppet? Why not? The biggest one. The one on display in Field's store. Giddyup! It's like Sunday. But it's Thursday. Don't talk nonsense. Don't try to hide, Field. I can see you. It is Sunday. No poppet. You shall have one, if it's all I can buy. - My customers are at the trial. - Go join them. I'd rather stay here and pray. Field, we have nothing to reproach ourselves for. If we bow our heads, it will never end. The rich have nothing to reproach themselves for. There are no witches among the rich. But you and I... What do you want? A poppet for Fancy. A Poppet? That one, the big one... All the poppets were sequestered. You know witches use them for casting their spells. They came to confiscate it? God bless you, Field. - I won't have my poppet? - You will not. - What's that? - Children playing. - In church? - Yes. Wait for me in the wagon. Go on! Hang her! She's a witch! She smokes a pipe. She curses. All the vagabonds have been her lovers. Hang her! No need to try her. We'll hang her. During the smallpox epidemic, she spread evil. She muttered when I refused her alms. One of my cows died 3 days later. What did you mutter? - The Ten Commandments. - You know them? Recite them. - "Thou shult not kill". - After that? - You lied, Sarah Good! - I'm not a witch. We'll see about that. Approach the children. The yellow bird! It's perched on her shoulder! It's flown away! No, it's there, in that dark nook! Have pity! Have pity! Damned bird, if it's here it will feel my stick. Go closer to the children, Sarah Good. Touch each one with your hand. Sarah Good, you are a witch! - Halleluiah! - Death to the witch! Corey, have you no shame? You don't believe in witches? I don't believe children's twaddle. If you confess, the court can spare you. - Confess. - No. I'm not a witch. Then you'll be hanged. I am not a witch. You lie, Sarah! You wake me up at night. You made my belly ache last week. You swore to boil me in your cauldron. Mary! Who dares interrupt the hearing? Take the accused back to her cell. Here's the document. "We confirm that Martha Simpson is virtuous..." Is she in prison? Ann Putnam accuses her of murdering her brothers. - You all signed it? - All of us. - What for? - To open the judges' eyes. And if they keep them shut? The judges are honest, John. Honest! Would honest judges believe children's antics? Admit it's all a plot. To reinforce the Church's waning power by terror. All the more reason to protest. Sign it. You've changed, John. You always used to be the first to fight injustice. True, I have changed. I used to think I was good. You won't have a poppet for a long while. Just when I wanted to buy you one. I have no luck. Were you afraid? You drove very fast. You must love me, Fancy. Your whole life long. Even if a stranger moves in and takes my place. Even if she's younger and prettier than me. Swear you'll never call her "Mama". Yes, Mama. - You'll always love me? - Yes, Mama. - Swear it. - Yes, Mama. My sweet child. What is it? You scared me. Go and play, Fancy. You're as pale as death, Elisabeth. I saw Abigail earlier. And I saw in her eyes... She'll have me hanged. Why not tell the judges she drank blood on the Sabbath? They wouldn't believe me. People think she's a saint. They kiss her hand in the street. Why should they believe me? You know you're a murderer? - Are you mad? - Abigail wants to take my place. If you haven't dishonored your bed, let her do it. Deceive the judges, let them hung Sarah Good. Let them hang your wife, marry your whore and live with her. You'll pay for it all. You'll go to Hell. You know me truly, I speak to you like to God. You're not God, you have no right to damn me. Forgive me, John. I only want your salvation. Mary! Why do you go to Salem when I forbade it? Are you mocking me? I'll whip you if you go out again! I've brought Fancy a present, Mistress Proctor. I sewed it during the hearing. Take care, Mary. God will punish you. What have I done? She accused Sarah Good before the judges. Do not deny it. I would never deny it. 'Twas my best act today. Really? Do you realize Sarah Good will die? But she won't die. They'll let her live if she confesses. I'll pray for her every night. Pray for yourself, Mary. I only defended myself. She tried to kill me many a time. If it were true you'd have said so. When she entered the courtroom, a hand seized me by the throat and I understood. You shan't go there anymore. - You'll lose your soul. - I must go every day. The Devil is in Salem, Mistress Proctor. I can't bear to be whipped. I'll chase the Devil out of you. I've just saved her life! I am accused? I declared that I live in your house and I have never seen the slightest trace of evil. And then? The judges said no more. Who accused her? I'm forbidden by law to say. Go to bed. I'm not a child! Then don't go to bed. - I want to go to bed. - So good night. Good night. We must all love each other, Mistress Proctor. This is a hard time for everyone. Very hard. I'm going to die, John. You think I'll let them do it? Salem has a public opinion. Yes, it does. I've just seen it. I'll be hanged by the neck, and I'll die in shame. I'll have had nothing in this life. Not even a smile from my child. You will remarry. Not right away. But you are young. You're strong. You have desires. When I surprised you in her room, the look in your eyes will haunt me to the gallows. Look at me. Look at me with those eyes. So I'll have that once in my life. "Praise be to God in the highest "before He sends down the darkness. "You will await the light "and He will change it into the shadow of death." Betty, sit up and don't put your elbows on the table. You give me orders? I am your father. The father of a saint. Mister Danforth said so. And you are very fortunate. Saints don't put their elbows on the table. Saints do what God tells them. Yet another seizure. Tituba, see what ails her and ask who torments her. - Where is it? - Here. Gently. Who did this? You ask me? Uncle, send for Mister Danforth. Open up, John. Open up. 'Tis God's punishment. - Can you hide my wife? - What does this mean? They'll arrest me. You, Martha? Why? That fool's golden wedding gift. He boasted that he has an educated wife who reads books. But reading books is no crime. It is a crime in Salem. Every day he went to court and came home gleefully, saying; "Today we unmasked two witches." So rejoice now, Gilles Corey, thanks to you, one more has been unmasked. Stay here as long as you please. As long as you are able to. Didn't you know? I too am a witch. There's only one thing to do. Come with us. We'll cross the forest and reach New York in 3 weeks. They will confiscate our land. Our children will be left penniless. But in New York... Too late. - 'Evening, John. - 'Evening, Cheever. 'Evening all. What do you want? - We've a warrant for Martha's arrest. - Take aim! 'Tis enough. - Woman! - Hold your tongue. Arrest me. And if God gave you a brain, think up a way to get me out of this. Be off, Cheever. Not yet. Give me your wife's poppets. My wife has no poppet, fool. Satisfied? Field said Elisabeth wanted to buy a poppet from him. What's this? 'Tis Mary's. Why didn't you mention it? I pricked myself. What of it? 'Tis a needle. This evening, we found in the belly of... of... of a person, I mean... a needle. That person swore that your wife... Mary! - What's this? - A poppet I made for Fancy. - When? - During the trial. Abigail was next to me. - Who stuck this needle in? - I did. Why? To get rid of it, sir. See! ls your mind at ease now? - Get out of my house. - Nobody move. John Proctor, I believe your wife is innocent. But I am charged to apply the law. I beg you, let me do my duty. Tomorrow I will testify to what I saw and heard here. Come, Elisabeth. Goodbye, John. In God's name, don't shackle her! Gilles! Don't move or I'll shoot. Till tomorrow, John. Till tomorrow. Papa! Did you see, Papa? I thought they'd take you away too. Will we live together just the two of us? Go to bed, my sweet. Come here! Tomorrow you'll talk before the judges, Mary. Abigail... Abigail? She'll kill me if I talk. And I'll kill you if you don't talk. You'll talk! You'll talk! Is the story of this poppet true? You sewed it yourself? Yes, sir. She signed a statement, Your Honor. He came to overthrow the court. - He ploughs on Sunday. - Leave this to me. Sit down, Mister... John Proctor, Your Honor. Sit down, Mary. The court allows it. So you never saw spirits? No, sir. You lied to the court. Unless you are lying now. Either way you go to prison. God is with me, sir. You are lying today, Mary. 'Tis but a brief crisis of your conscience. The court will ignore it and God will pardon you. But the charges you made yesterday, tremble now if they be lies. On your evidence, the court tried Sarah Good and condemned her to death. You will be thrown into a cell where you'll die. God will turn from you in disgust. Parris! Be silent and sit down. And the others... Did the others lie too? Yes, sir. Fetch the children. Children, Mary Warren has declared under oath that you never saw spirits. Mary, you know you're lying! You maintain what you said? I do, sir. Silence! May I ask her a question, Your Honor? Mary... when you saw Sarah Good here yesterday, you fainted, did you not? I pretended to. I helped you up three times. Your hands were icy, your heart didn't beat. I was pretending, sir. And the others were too. So it would seem you can faint at will. Then do it. Do it now. Did you hear, Mary? - I can't. - But you just said... Not like this, not now. Mary... Try again. Go on! I can't. Yesterday you could, here. - Yes. - Doesn't that prove there were spirits and you obeyed them? - I believed I saw spirits. You believed without seeing them? I don't know. Everyone else seemed to. I believed I saw them. But I swear, Mister Danforth, I didn't really see them. Silence! Silence! Abigail... God sees us. He will send us to Hell if we have condemned an innocent. Search your heart, and on this Bible, answer truthfully. Could those evil spirits be simply an illusion? Do you live through my nights? They even torment me in my bed. Old hags pull my hair, they scratch me and slap me. A cripple hits me with his crutch on my left arm, always the same spot. Here! My blood is spilt because I purified this town by denouncing Satan. Haven't I suffered enough? Must I be insulted in court, and suspected by the judges? But I do not suspect you. Must I cry out all over town; "You loved me and kissed my hands, "Governor Dunforth says I'm a liar, a criminal!" Abigail, I beg you. I believe you. Shackle Mary Warren! Wait. I'll explain. - Explain? - Your Honor, Abigail is a whore. What are you saying? A whore who wanted to kill my wife. You accuse this child? I know what she is. I have lain with her. You are a lecher. Yes. John! It's the truth, Francis. My wife surprised us and turned her out. You wanted revenge, did you not? You wanted to dance on Elisabeth's grave. There, I've said it all. Is it true? - I won't answer. I wish to leave. - I order you to stay. Willard, fetch Mistress Proctor. Don't speak of this, and knock before bringing her in. You claim your wife is honest. Stand up. Your wife has never lied to you? Never, sir. When she turned Abigail out, did she know the reason for it? Yes, sir. Very well. Abigail, if Mistress Proctor confirms your conduct was indecent, God have mercy on you. Wait! Turn your back. You too, Abigail. Stand at a distance. And do not turn round, whatever happens. Is that clear? No one in this courtroom is to utter a word, or make a gesture. Come in. Sit down. Look at me, not your husband. Yes, sir. Why did you dismiss Abigail Williams? I wasn't satisfied with her work. Look at me. Was she slovenly? Lazy? Was she lacking in... decency in her behavior? Your Honor, I... I was sick at the time and... - That girl... - Look at me. Yes, sir. Abigail Williams had... Abigail Williums...? I imagined my husband fancied her and I dismissed her. He turned away from you? My husband is a good husband. So he did not reject you? - But while I was sick, l... - Look at me! As for as you know, did John Proctor commit the crime of lechery? I repeat my question. Is your husband a lecher? No, sir. I confessed it all! She has spoken. Parris, take her out! - She tried to save my honor. - Indeed? And sacrifice Sarah Good, Mistress Simpson and herself? When a man sullies his name publicly, you must believe him. Mary, tell the judge Abigail danced in the moonlight. No, Mary! No! Don't claw me! Betty! Mary! She shows her claws! Don't hurt me! No, Mary! Betty! I'm not hurting them. They see nothing. Mary Warren, exorcise these children! But Mister Danforth! "But Mister Danforth!" - Did you sign a pact with the Devil? - No, Mister Danforth! "No, Mister Danforth!" - Why do they repeat your words? - Give me a whip. They're pretending! "They're pretending!" Stop it, Abie! Stop! "Stop it, Abie! Stop!" I said stop it! "I said stop it!" Over there! Silence! My God! You have all gone mad! Judge Adam, clear the court. Say what they do in the moonlight. Don't touch me. He's the Devil's agent. I love Jesus! I don't want to be hanged! Did Proctor make you do the Devil's work? Night and day he comes to force me to sign it. - Sign what? - The Devil's book? He comes with a black book? He says; "I'll kill you if my wife hangs." "We must overthrow the court", he says that too. He wakes me at midnight, his eyes like burning coals, I sign, I sign! I love God! I love God, Abie! I'll never harm you again. God be praised. God be praised. Praise to Our Lord John Proctor, you made a pact with the Devil. Confess to it! The charges are daunting, your confession will save your life. And save your consciences. What do you say? - I suy God is dead. - Blasphemy! Herrick, Willard, arrest him. Defend yourself, John. They want to murder you. They want to murder you, John! I declare the hearing over. Four months have passed. The number of accused rises daily. No one, not even the pastors, is safe from denunciation. The poor complain, the rich are fearful. "By virtue of the decree of the Special Court "promulgated September 6th, 1692, "Martha and Gilles Corey, "Rebecca Nurse and John Proctor "will be hanged tomorrow, "Tuesday October 18th "at 5 o'clock in the morning. "In front of Salem Prison, "until death. "Unless they confess their crimes. "On this condition only, "their lives will be spared." Those little bitches spare no one. Shopkeepers, lawyers, even pastors are charged. People don't dare leave their homes. And business is at a standstill. Stock is rotting in the warehouses. Are you listening? This has to end. Do you hear? We're ruining ourselves. What do you want me to do? Join forces with us. - Who are you? - Sensible citizens. And you need me? You're the wealthiest mun here. We'll gain nothing without the wealthy on our side. - Others are wealthy. - They'll come if you do. My house at 5 p.m. I'll expect you. I will not come, James. God sent us this scourge to punish our sins. It's useless, Thomas. We all know your daughter set this off. Watch out. Watch out, yourself. Compromise me, and my daughter will tell the court... Mark me, Thomas. If she says my name before the judges, I'll find you wherever you are, and put two bullets in your belly. There you are, pests! What foulness are you up to? The black dog! Will you calm down, toad! Have you done? That's the way to treat them. Mister Putnam, isn't he your brother? We've had no contact for years. I don't know why he came. We've come to take Ann to the prison. I don't want to! I don't want to. Ann is tired, girls. Go without her. Papa, don't make me go. I don't want to see them hurt him. What is this? They're going to torture old Corey. One last attempt to make him talk. It's our duty to be present and help justice. You are a good citizen, Mister Putnam. What would the court think if you turn your child from her duty? - Papa... - Do as you're told. - Thomas! - That's an order. Do come. This time, I'm sure they'll make him die. - Suspend the executions, sir. - Why? I was almost murdered. It's sharp. They see Rebecca Nurse as a saint, John Proctor as a good citizen. If you hang them, I fear a riot. There are people who meet at night, and talk among themselves. The earth is quaking. More reason to be done with it fast. Give me more time, they may confess. They had four months to confess, Reverend Parris. Are they guilty or not? They are. Then they must be hanged. You think I enjoy shedding blood? I haven't slept for six months. But God chose us. We are His instruments. And we will fulfill our mandate. Are you afraid? I am afraid, at times. I know we're hated, what can I do? If not strike harder? Woe to he who God has chosen to spread terror. But woe to he who ceases before the allotted time. I'm going to question old Corey. Will you come? "By virtue of the decree of the Special Court, "Martha and Gilles Corey, "Rebecca Nurse and John Proctor "will be hanged tomorrow, 18th of October, "at 5 o'clock in the morning, "until death." - You heard what he said? - Who? - The town crier. - Yes. He said nothing of Elisabeth Proctor. Haven't you heard? She won't be hanged. - Why not? - She is four months pregnant. She's granted one more year. A year's not long, you know. Poor Abigail. You would marry the man and hang the wife, but the wife is saved, the husband will hang. It stinks here! What is that? The Proctors' cow. It must have died of neglect. Wait for me. I must shut the door. Why should you care? It's no one's house now. Rebecca, my wife condemned me. Strange dream. I'm writing my will, Martha. You have two dozen shirts? Shut up, you fool. We'll be hanged and our goods dispersed. My shirts will be worn by Putnam's wife. I won't be hanged, Martha. I know the law. I never said yes to the judges, and I never said no. In that case, one is neither judged nor condemned. It's the law, John. Why didn't you say so? We'd have saved our skins. What does it mean, Gilles? It means... It means I pay my debts. I will pay, Martha. Yes, indeed. My silence will pay for my foolish chatter. Gilles Corey? Here I am. I will say nothing. My testament. Give it to my sons, and tell them I died without being judged, consequently the farm is theirs with everything above and everything beneath. Gilles! I'm sure they will smother him with stones. Aye. With stones. In any case, something heavy. He's an honest man, is he not? The best of men. And our sons will have the farm? I am glad of it. I believe... I believe he is dying. Will you speak, Gilles Corey? What did you say? Repeat it. Once more. For the last time, Corey! It's useless, sir. It's over. The dog! May he burn in Hell. He did nothing! - Ann Putnam! - I see him. There! There! He says he did nothing. You can't see the dead. I see him. He says God damns us. Willard, she's delirious. Shut her up and take her home. - When is this sale? - Day after tomorrow, I think. - When is this sale? - Day after tomorrow, I think. As we hang them tomorrow. You... Will you buy it? - Buy what? - The Proctor farm. I don't deal in goods of the dead. You bought Mistress Simpson's farm. Precisely. - You will buy the farm. - I? I will lend you the money. You'll owe me two-thirds of the harvest... Don't let her be seen. Governor's order. She is mad. You have blood on your right hand. The child had a nosebleed. You made her nose bleed. Be gone! Before I break your neck. Ann... Witch! Witch! You are the witch. Let us go, Mama! You're the witch! - Put her to bed. - Don't touch her. I told you not to touch her. - I'll fetch the doctor. - No need. She'll die. - Are you mad? - She will die, like the other six. You know that. Because it's you who killed them. I asked God's pardon for not loving you. It's unnatural to feel repulsed by your husband. Now, I know. I know. The child has spoken. When she's dead, I'll have you hanged. The other day, we decided to send a delegation to the Governor to beg him to dissolve the Special Court and try the presumed witches in an ordinary court. When do you leave? We asked you to contact your brother. Does he agree? Do we need him? Without him, all is lost. So what will we do? We will wait. For what? To be hanged? Have no fear, friend, they won't hang us. You'll be hanged, Corbett... by the neck, until death. Like everyone. Evil goes in circles. It devoured the poor, it will devour the rich. And the forest will reclaim it all. - What is it, Thomas? - Can't you see? I'm a witch. You know my daughter loves you not. - I want to live. - So do we. Very well... I accept to preside over your delegation. Sirs, if you would be so kind as to go tonight, you'd reach Boston by 10 o'clock. Lord Philips could dispatch a messenger to halt the executions. It's my wife that's to be hanged. I sympathize with you, Francis. Suppose we convince the Governor that your wife, Martha Corey and Proctor are innocent. Yet one of them may be writing a confession in their cell now. They have resisted torture for 4 months without breaking. They resisted torture. Can they resist the fear of death? The other two confessed on the gallows. If they die without a word, where do we stand? Your wife is a saint, Francis. She'd sacrifice herself to save the town. Try to be worthy of her. I did warn you. Now keep quiet. The session is over. We'll meet at sun up. Come mounted, we'll leave at once. On our return, you'll hear how we did. - The dogs! - Enough. Now hear me. You have understood? We must count on ourselves. Go home, load your guns, we meet by the gallows at dawn. There's more? Peter Corey and his friends will come armed to stop us. Arrest them at once! You give me orders, Mister? Go get your pay from Charlie. Arrest them and stir up the village? Reverend Parris, you're a brainless man. We'll mass our troops around the gibbet. Huthorne, I have 37 soldiers, no more. I don't even know if they are sure. The gibbet is outside the prison? Is there not a gibbet in the prison yard? No. But it can be arranged. Good. Arrange it. We'll let the rebels wait at the foot of the gibbet while we hang the criminals inside the prison. Go. We'll never see this face again. Tomorrow, we will be young and beautiful. It's nothing. I'm afraid, that's all. It hurts, you know. What? The noose. The noose. I was brave when I had my self-respect. But now... they may have to tie me up. John. Die well, die badly... Are you never tempted to say you're a witch? To say you rode on a broomstick? It is so stupid that it wouldn't even be a lie. And if I confess I'm a witch? What would you say? You despise me too much to answer. I don't despise you. You don't despise anyone. It comes to the same. But others would despise me, rest assured. Francis, your husband. And young Corey whose father died because of me. They'll come to see me hanged. You'll all be hanged because of me. God will not forgive me, you can be sure. Nor will Elisabeth. You know why I don't want to die? Because I'm a vile wretch. I have nothing left now. A few more years if I confess. In New York nobody knows me. I'm withering away through lack of work! I thank You, o Lord. You have given me courage. Only yesterday the sinners were naked and helpless. And my absolute power appalled me. But as the whole town stands with them, I know I am on the path of righteousness. I will take their lives with no remorse, just us they are ready to take mine. Being a judge frightens me no more as You let me hope I shall be a martyr. What do you want, my child? I have seen the angels. Let me talk alone with Proctor, you'll have his confession in an hour. I swore I'd kill you. It was I who made you evil. I'm more to blame than you are. Why is this body so pure? Where is the evil? Where is the evil? What do you want? To see you. You'll stay until the end? Then you'll watch me hang? Why not? What do they all say about me? What does Nurse say? You know very well what he says. And the Corey boys... they hate me, do they not? They do not like you. Is there anyone who defends me? Elisabeth begged God's pardon publicly, for marrying you. She was right. You'll be damned, John. You too. Of course. Soon they'll hang you, and then one day they'll chase me out. So I'll go to Boston, and sell myself to survive. What is it? No one must touch you after I die! Then you mustn't die. If you live, you can do what you like with me. Live? WiTh you? They all despise you now, but in my soul you're saved. I am the only one who doesn't despise you. You're safe, John. Safe in my heart. We'll go to New York, and start again. We'll be alone, forgotten and happy. Pray to God we'll pity each other. Pity? Never! We'll burn! I'm a coward. And if you are? Your cowardice is mine. Evil is drawn to evil, like water to the river. I'll confess whatever they want. Take me to Judge Dunforth. Hurry! Sit down. If you want to start right away... Here. What do I confess? Whatever you like. You have a wide choice. I asked, when will he be released? What is that to you, Abigail? It is beyond my jurisdiction. I order the execution to be postponed, that is all. As to releasing him... - Are you sure he's guilty? - He's confessed. If I were you, I would be sure of nothing, Mister Dunforth. I'll see what I can do for him. - Good. - Where are you going? I'm going to see John. - John? - John Proctor. If he changes his mind... It's useless. I'll go myself. I'll come with you. Watch the other two executions. It's your duty. - Go down into the yard. - The yard? Yes. There's a mob outside. It will take place in the yard. Fix it like that. John is taller than me. You can't hang Proctor. He has confessed. Proctor? That's hard to believe! I say he has. All the better for you. One less death on your conscience. There. Come. I'll leave you. You wanted to see me before you die? I'm not going to die, John. I'm pregnant. Pregnant? Yes, you'll live. And asking me to die doesn't bother you? Isn't that what you came for? I came to beg you to live. I'll live if I confess. Look! Add that you caused the death of Putnam's cows, and sign. I'm your wife, I don't want you to die. You are the best of men, John. That is why you must live. The best? Then all mankind will be roast on a spit. The best of men is damned. If God condemns you to Hell, I refuse my share of Heaven. It's all my fault. My shame for my body made you ashamed to desire me. I was ice and fire. I longed for your caresses, I hated my turmoil. My tongue was tied, my heart sealed, my body paralyzed. You saw me as your judge, I was your executioner. Four months ago my eyes were opened. No one else would have done what you did for me. You confessed before all and condemned yourself to save me. I love you. Did you beg God's forgiveness for marrying me? Me? The only pride I have left is in being your wife. Look at me. Have you ever lied to me? Never. Except once, before the court, when they asked me if you were an adulterer. Repeat what you just said to me. You are a good man, John, you are courageous, you are pure, and you don't even know it. But the whole village knows it for you. Aye! They told me you will confess. I admit I wanted to lie to save my life. I lost faith in God as you made me lose faith in myself. Enough! Are you a witch? Aye or nay? Nay, sir. The only witches that exist are in your mind. Let me hold my head high. I've bowed it in shame for so long. She has restored my pride. I did it so you would live. Of course. You couldn't know it would erase my fear of death. Do you believe that, sir? I fought to live because I was ashamed of my life. That's over. A new-born pride is demanding. Tell me I'm right. Do your duty as his wife, Elisabeth. Tell him he sins through pride. Who will protect your family if you die? Your duty is to live. Even at the price of a lie? Who is talking about a lie? We ask you for your signature. If you refuse it, you're killing yourself. Do you not know that God forbids suicide? For the last time in this life, be my judge. I'm right, am I not? I can no longer tell good from evil. This joy you restored to me... is it possible that it be pride? Yes. Pride, criminal pride. God will blame you for the blood that's shed. Parris! Blood will be shed? - What blood? - He means your own. A hanged man does not bleed. Look at him. You con see he speaks of his own blood. All my friends are here. All my friends, with arms. They were true friends. Expect nothing. We'll hang you in the prison. Do you still say I die for nothing? If I agree to lie, they'll slink off in shame, believing you are right. But when I feel the noose, their rage will strike Salem and sweep you away. My children will live in freedom. Tell me I am right. You are right. Pardon them, sir. They are innocent. Reverend Parris, nowhere is it written that judges are infallible. But the law states that their sentences must be carried out. If you are innocent, forgive me. Take them away! - If you deceived me, beware! - Abigail! You can't, he confessed! He confessed nothing. Take her away! I lied! I swear I lied! I lied! I swear he's innocent! No, Parris. I won't kiss a cross that you touched. Rebecca Nurse, when you're in Heaven, pray for me. God as my witness, I hate what I do. I will pray for you. Help! Help! Seize her! Quick! John! - It's over. - For all three? For all three. Kill me, cowards! Other judges will come, and they will be without pity. Do I frighten you? Murderer. What do you want, vulture? Isn't killing them enough? She must be hanged! Hang her! Hang her! More judges? She killed Proctor! I killed him too. So did you. And you. Let her be. She loved him.
