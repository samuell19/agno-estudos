[Subtitles by Vishu] Rani Arts Complete rights Shri Vighneshwara Enterprises K A Natarajan presents Devara Duddu[God's Money] Swamy. Udupi Krishna. I can manage to put only 10 paise into this box. I've put the papads out to dry in the sun. May there be enough sun. Madam. Madam. Who is it? Is it Kempi? Yes. Since yesterday night, I'm burning up. Cold. You're always in the water. How did you get the cold? Poor like us, get only cold. Put any amount of water in this milk, one wouldn't know. But put a little water on the head and it leaks out of nose. But tell me... Why did you come to deliver the milk in this state? Madam, ...without missing a day, ...if I deliver milk, ...I hope I would one day be able to bear a child. Don't worry. Udupi Krishna will definitely bless you one day. When will he? I get all kinds of aches in my body. Except for that ache in the waist. Kempi, here's your money. Count them. It'll be right. Quarter of a litre a day for 30 days is 7.5 litres. How much more would you even buy? Kempi. One must stretch the legs only as much as the bed allows. Even this milk... ...is bought only for my husband. I will win. I will definitely win. I will definitely win the Chakrabandha contest this time. What does it say this time? Eyes. Woman. Woman. Eyes. Eyes. Woman. Eyes, woman, woman, eyes.... I can't think of the answer. So, I'll just choose whatever I please. Eyes is right. What Maadhu? You're sending your entry this time too? Like performing rites on every new moon's day, why do you waste your money every month? Listen Giri. Just keep watching... I'll get hold of his hair and get my prize this time. I've written it so beautifully, you know? You won't get it just because you wrote. Do one thing. Put money in your god's box and pray that you win this time. You might win. You idiot. I've already tried these offerings and box money tricks a thousand times. And I've blown them away just like that. God doesn't pay attention to guys like us. Know it all! Just because you didn't get what you prayed for, won't anybody in the world get anything? Did you read yesterday's newspaper? Some rich man... put 50,000 rupees into Tirupati temple donation box. Without getting what he wanted... ...is he a fool to put so much money into the box? Listen to me, oh gullible idiot! Imagine you would get one rupee for doing a man's job. And imagine you'd get 10 rupees for doing the same job for another. Whose job would you do? Who would let go of the more profitable one? I'll do the 10 rupee job. Your god is also like that. If god granted what the rich man wished, god gets 50,000 rupees in the box. If he grants what this poor Maadhuraya prayed for, he would only get 5 rupees. Your Paramathma, would he choose 5 rupees or 50,000 rupees? Listen Giri. Don't think I'm an atheist. To me my conscience is god. I've contested putting my faith on my conscience. I'll definitely win this time. [Customers complaining that they haven't received the food they ordered] Krishna! Are you playing with your father in the kitchen? Customers are shouting here for their Dosas. Come attend the tables. Idiot! Can't you see? Can't you see? Let it go. Why? You dare put your hand on the girl? In my restaurant, boys and girls are treated the same. You had to exercise on me to digest your food? Your time is bad. I can see that. Your time is bad too. Oh, my money is gone. Your time is very good. And mine? Yours? Not good at all. It's gone. My business is ruined. The cash from the register is gone. Sir. Did you see how I taught those delinquents a lesson? Yes, yes. You taught them. No one would dare to pick fights here in future. Yes. Nobody would come to our restaurant any more. What good have you done, Muddukrishna? People ran away without paying. That's 25 rupees. People who would've come, didn't come. That's another 100 rupees loss. All the food that's prepared and the broken furniture costs about 300 rupees. Even if I forget them, some 360 rupees cash from the register is gone. If I add them all up, it totals about 785 rupees. I don't want to know anything. You'll pay me back this money by working for 2 years, 4 months and 1 week. Now go to the accountant and sign a voucher saying you've borrowed 785 rupees from me. Do you understand? Sir. I did all this to help you and your daughter. Who asked you to? There's law and police. You must have informed them. Why did you take the law into your hands? Go now. I said go. You keep quiet. Why did you come here with your friends during your classes? What is this Ambuja? Your Krishna is coming today? What's the arrival time? Is it 6 P.M? Would he come in a car or an auto-rickshaw? Or would he come on a bicycle because the petrol is costly? He would come on Garuda blowing his conch. Stand aside. I have to draw Krishna's feet. Why do you struggle so much to draw the feet? Bring a bucketful of batter. I'll stick my feet in it and walk all over. Whose feet do you think I'm drawing? Krishna's or Kamsa's? How does it matter? Ambuja, even if you book a trunk call to Vaikunta, he won't come. Why won't he come? If we call him with true devotion, ...he'll come to this poor man's house too. Oh? He would come. Didn't I have true devotion before? What did he do for me? My son Muddukrishna... To make him an educated man, we worked hard. Did he[God] show even a bit of compassion towards us? Krishna, Protector, Saviour of the orphaned, they call him. He isn't worth a cent for the needy. But he has thousands. Krishna has only two wives. You say that he has thousands of them. I didn't talk about the women. I said he has thousands of names. I'm talking about the Sahasranama. Look here. I never pray to him for jewels or clothes or anything. This mangalasutra must remain intact is what I pray to him. In this matter, Krishna has truly blessed me. Let it go, Ambuja. Have you prepared dirt with butter for your Krishna? Why dirt? Don't you know? When your Krishna comes... Put some dirt in his mouth. Hear me out. You can see the whole universe in his mouth then. He's like an old model television. Krishna, Krishna. Keep making fun. To him, naughty people like you and devoted people like me are the same. You keep offering him sweets and I will keep making fun of him. I too will see what he will do. I'll be back. Going for the sweets? I'll bring some. She has drawn only Krishna's feet entering. I'll draw his feet leaving. Krishna you leave quickly.[A joke on song 'Krishna nee begane baro'] What is this father? You're drawing Krishna's feet? What's the big deal in it? Just write an eight and draw 5 small zeroes above it. That's all. That's alright. But every year Krishna's feet remains the same. Won't they grow? Won't he grow? Muddukrishna, great men remain the same all the time. Our God Krishna is also like that. Forget your Paramathma. Let's ask our son what he's up to. What happened to that railway canteen job? Did you go meet them? I came straight home from there. What all did they ask? They asked me some things about railways. They asked me what is fish plate. I told them it's a plate of fish. Krishna. Question itself is dizzying. They asked me what is a signal. I told them it's a toothpaste. Very good. They asked me what does red light indicate? I told them that it's an area in Bombay where a particular sort of girls live. Smart brain. How did you get to know things even I don't know? He knows everything. Poor child has gone to great lengths to learn all that he can. If you don't know something, ask him and learn. Then... Then? They asked me where does the Bangalore mail run? I said I don't know where it's running now. But five years ago it ran in Menaka, Bharat and Gopal theatres. My dearest. You were scolding him for watching too many films. Now you see where it helped him? Amma... They asked me what is departure. I said leaving. They said I could leave. And I came. Did you ask them when should you visit them again? Why should he ask? He has answered them like 'that'. Appointment order will come here. You come dear. You too come. We shall offer some to God and then eat. What is this? She seems to be ordering me around. Isn't mother your superior? Yes. Women are superior in all households now. -Appa. -Huh? Madam's husband. The name sticks to me. Sorry. I must apologise to you. You are masters. Coming on wrong side is your right. To tolerate that is our duty, right? Please don't tell this to my father. My god. I'd be lucky if you don't tell your father that I dashed into you. I'm... ...your hotel server. What? What are you searching? All the papads in my container fell into the drain. I was looking at that. Le it go. You can buy some more. If we were so wealthy, why would we have to sell them door to door? To make those papads, ...my mother would've worked very hard, you know? One moment. Take this money. You must not suffer the loss. Many thanks. We are not cheap like you seem to think. A request to you. What? Ride your cycle to anywhere you like. But... Don't ride it on poor people's lives. That's all. Madam, madam. Come dear. Who is it? Whom do you want? You... No, no. Papads... No, no. I was told that you sell papads. Did you want to buy some? Oh but this morning, I sent all that I had to doctor's and lawyer's house. They fell into the drain. Fell into the drain? He didn't drop them. Our cycles clashed and it all fell down. Krishna, Krishna. Then... He felt sad about losing the papads his mother worked hard to make. I tried to give him 10 rupees since I caused it. He refused to take it and left. You please take it madam. Please take it. No, dear. No. I'm glad people can still understand others' pain. You understood. That satisfaction is enough. What is your name? -Radha. -Radha? Madam? Come in Kempi. I'll leave. She went just like she came. Kempi... ...today's girls can't stop moving. Yes, but why did she come here? -Kempi? -Madam? Do you know this girl? Why do you ask so? She's the daughter of the owner of the hotel your husband works in. Is it? She looks like an Ivory doll. I guessed that she might be the daughter of someone important. Then why wait? Why don't you ask her hand for your son? You are joking, right? Why? What's wrong? Can there be any relationship between a palace and a dump? We both are different. Forget about it. Tell me. why have you come at this hour? What happened? Where else would I go? I've decided to come stay here. I'll help you with all the odd chores. Eating any leftovers you give me, ...I'll pass my time. Why are you talking like this, Kempi? Have you fought with your husband again? I have no strength left to even quarrel with him any more. That's why I came here. Why do you say so? Yes... He would drink till he couldn't and come home late and fall sleep. Now he can't even do that. I told him, again and again, not to drink and spoil his health. But he wouldn't listen. Madam... ...so I decided not to stay where I'm not respected. Kempi, Kempi... The ogre has come calling... Kempi is not here, go. What? What now? Why have you come calling Kempi now? Kempi's here. What now? You've come to Ayya's house? What else should I have done? What's all this Gangappa? -Move aside. -You keep quiet. Listen. Shouldn't you look after your wife? He would prefer a bottle of liquor to his wife. All wives pray to God that they die before their husbands. I... pray that I die after him. You know why madam? There's no one to look after him after I die. To add to our woes, there's not even a worm born to us. Did you hear? You must be very lucky to have such a wife. You must give up drinking at least after hearing this. No, he won't. No. he won't. Madam, I came here to tell her that I've given up drinking. I've given up drinking. Come let's go. You swear on me? Their god? You swear on Udupi Krishna? I swear on their god too. Swear on you, on me. I've given up drinking. What? Drinking. Oh my dear Ogre. What a nice thing you've done. My little parrot. Krishna, it's all your blessings. Kempi, go happily now. Beware! You've sworn on god. I'll leave madam. Come. Call me by my name, Kempi. I'll come. Kempi... Come. I'll leave madam. Amma. Come, Muddukrishna. Half of all papads to lawyer's house and the other half to doctor's... You delivered? Did they pay you? Money? And then... Tell me... All the papads fell into the drain. Didn't they notice it when you delivered? -Amma... -Huh? Amma. That girl... Tell me. Why do you hesitate? She came here too? Nanjunda... There's only two words left. If we fill them properly... This time, Rs.2000, first prize in the Chakrabandha competition is guaranteed. Read the question. It's not very difficult. It's difficult to control this. Woman or eyes? You can't trust your eyes. It goes everywhere. Even woman doesn't listen to you. She does as she wishes. Because our eyes don't obey our wishes that we have to obey a woman. Therefore eyes are right. If we close our eyes, it's like it's obeying us, right? So, woman is right. Ok. What's the other one? Most ruin themselves because of this. Pleasure or gambling. Pleasure is something everybody enjoys. So, gambling is right. Gambling is... ...only about losing money. But pleasure is not like that. It has more than that. So, pleasure is right. You're right. Pleasure or gambling? Nanjunda... What if you're right and gambling is the right answer? Srinivasa, you do one thing. Touch one of these two fingers. Touch. Pleasure is right. How's that? This is gambling. This is pleasure. You left gambling... ...and picked pleasure. So, pleasure is right. Let it go. Anyway the problem is solved now. -Sir? -What? I'm feeling... ...feverish and want to go home? I feel upset too. Go to hell. But before going... ...put this into the post box. Today is the last day for Chakrabandha competition. Don't throw it away instead of putting it in the post box. How can I? I'm sending my entry too. You? What have you written? Woman or eyes? Eyes! We've chosen woman. Come here. Pleasure or gambling? Gambling. And we, pleasure... What is this? He has chosen all the other ones. Oh, let it go. We're sure to get the prize. Maadhuraya... One has to fight in this competition with his wits. One must have intelligence and memory power for that. You have neither. So why would you participate? So that you may get the prize. Yes, they'll me the prize only because you told them so. We're idiots to talk with you. Go now. Go, go. Why do you get angry? Go! Sir. There's no stamp on this cover. We've forgotten about it in this hullabaloo. Is this a sample of your memory power? Go! Come. Paste the stamp to it. Take this. Why do you hesitate? Is it a snake or a scorpion? Spit. His time is not good. This man. Seems to be born of time. Oh, evening prayers are on? Don't you know about my prayers? All it needs is a bit of jaggery candy for offering. But why are you back home so early today? Both my body and mind didn't feel well. So, informed my boss and came home. Don't feel well in the mind? Look. I'll tell you something... Those who are rich may not feel as happy as us. This mind, if you let it, will burn down the whole city. Looks like my wife is becoming the great poetess Sanchi Honnamma. Krishna, Krishna! Don't compare a molehill to a mountain. She came from a village and I too come from a village. This is the extent of the similarity between us. What if you are from the village? You are no less than anyone. You came as an innocent girl after our marriage. 'Why do you sleep alone on the roof?', you asked. And then told me to come inside. Then in no time, mesmerised me with your sweet talk. When I remember all that, I too feel young again. Hands off. Go wash your hands... Well I'm there for just that... Are you done with your singing? Ambu... Rice on this leaf... With curd on it... Mango pickle... Hands off... And such a wife in front of me... To experience all this... A man must have earned enough karma in his previous lives. Well you seem to have earned it. This contentment is what makes life here a paradise. If one is wise enough to see this, he enjoys. Otherwise nothing. Ambu... Believe me. Though this Maadhuraya is poor in wealth... ...he is a millionaire when it comes to family. Ambu... You... -You have. -Yes, I will. You will be at home, right? I'll go to Hanuman's temple be right back. Close the main door and then sleep. Don't just fall asleep. What? You go now. Let the world scream...[singing] ...or fight. Nothing compares to you, O sleep... Maadhu, there's none to disturb you... Be it sun or rain... ...you keep on moving. Sir, you're at home. What is it Kempamma? Why are you so tensed? I was just thinking about you. -The money you gave... -I came to collect that, sir. My husband is suffering from stomach ache. He's writhing like a fish removed from water. Doctor asked me to bring some medicines right now to save him. Please give me my money. His life is in your hands now. 50 rupees. Right now? I beg you, do something. -I won't live if he dies. -Kempamma... You go now... I'll bring the money to your home in half an hour's time. Please do that sir. May god bless you with good life. I don't have a cent in hand. 50 rupees? My god! Why did this Kempi give her money to me? I lost the money on these useless Chakrabandha competitions. What shall I do now? Whom shall I ask? Where shall I go? [Doctor asked me to bring some medicines right now to save him.] [He's writhing like a fish removed from water.] [His life is in your hands now.] [I won't live if he dies.] What shall I do now? Whom shall I ask? Where shall I go? Where's the house lock? Udupi Shri Krishna's money box. I have God's money. What if I take the money? Yes, as if I let you take it. It's God's money. I was just looking. Why do I need it? What for? Is it? Then it's fine. I thought she had come. That's alright. But what will I tell her when she asks? That's Ok. What's wrong in taking the money in emergencies? 25... 30... 40... 45... 50... 51... It's exactly 51. Why is body shaking like this? Is it a robbery or fraud? This is all some kind of weakness... Yes... I too feel the same way. I went till the corner of the road. But couldn't go farther for some reason. Tomorrow is Saturday. I thought tomorrow is more auspicious to visit his temple and came back. That's fine... Why are you standing with hands folded like this? Just like that. Wanted to pose like Swami Vivekananda. And I did. What's wrong? Do you see? After committing something wrong, see how hands tie themselves together. Wrong? Who? When? Where? There. Here? Ok. Now that you know, why make a fuss? Not making a fuss. I'll tell you what I know. Because you know what you've done is wrong... ...you stand so fearfully in front of your wife. Why should I fear? What have I done? I took money from the box. Where did the money in the box come from? You put it in there. Where did you get it? I gave it to you. Who gave it to you? Shri Krishna gave it to you. Yes, believe what you want. Your Krishna gave it. So, I took it for the second time. Is it wrong? Wonderful... Tell me... If... ...your boss... ...sent your salary with a servant, and you tip a rupee to that servant... Say you needed a rupee some other time... and you meet him exactly at that time. To ask back the rupee you tipped that servant... ...is it right? This is also like that. The money that you've taken now... ...God will get it back from you with interest. How will he get it back? Did he leave it behind for me? What if I don't give him? Will he send a warrant from his Udupi temple? Go away, naive woman. He has many cases against him. You make such fuss for one money box. You know how many curd pitchers he has broken? Poor Kempamma's husband... ...is sick and dying. At this hour, what is wrong in giving her money back? Look here, Ambu... ...if your Krishna really has any guts, ...ask him to come to me to get his money back. I'll be back. Go, go. You'll clear Kempi's debt. But... ...now you're in Krishna's debt. It won't... Krishna...Krishna... [singing film song - Amara Madura Prema] This full moon night is so beautiful. I can sleep peacefully. Who is it? Is it Krishna? Yes Maadhu. It's me, Krishna. Krishna? Are you coming from Gokula [Lord's Krishna's abode]... or from a cinema shooting? From Gokula... Krishnaswamy... ...you usually do not make time out of your group dance with Gopikas, do you? But now I've come. Oh, Okay. When a shetti comes a-calling, there must be something worth his time... Yes, yes... The money you've taken from my box... ...I've come to collect it. The money from the box? Krishnaswamy... Have you run into such bad times that you've to go collecting loose change from collection boxes? -Maadhu... -Huh? This arrangement of god's money box... ...is for your own benefit... ...and not for me. That's right. I had some problem and I took from it. So, what's wrong now? There's nothing wrong in taking. But that attitude of saying 'so what's wrong?'... ...that's wrong. What is this? You make such fuss over me taking money from my own box. Had I taken money from you signing a document or something... ...you would've tortured me. Signing a document over taking money from the box? How would you know of money problems? The only money(mani) you know is Rukmani(Krishna's wife). When you're married to Rukmani, how would you know of the troubles we poor people face? Maadhu. The responsibilities I have... ...how would you know of them? Oh, some big responsibilities you have. Middle class have no dignity left. What about you? You have two families to enjoy. For your Rukmani's or Satyabhama's families... ...have you ever bought groceries? Have you ever wandered from school to school for a seat for your child? Let it go. Now when cloth prices are through the roof, ...if there was Draupadi Vastraapaharana... ...you would've remained silent. And couldn't have supplied even a metre of cloth. Times are bad. I have to listen to all this for asking 50 rupees back? Maadhu. All the troubles faced by all lives in this world... ...are the same troubles I face. You've already mentioned all of this in your Bhagawadgeeta. Krishnaswamy. Preaching is easy, but to follow what you preach is difficult. To stand as a stone in a temple is easy. But to stand in a queue for cooking oil is difficult. To roam around with your Chakra is easy... But to wander around for Sakkare[sugar] is difficult. I know everyone's troubles. This world is my family. I know very well, how is everybody, Maadhu. What do you know? You say this whole world is your family. Why have you made some people rich and others poor? Maadhu. I don't make anyone rich... ...or poor. Whoever saves money... ...in their bank of future, ...will encash that and live happily. And those who don't, suffer. Krishnaswamy. Forget about others. Have I accrued any merits from my previous life? How can I tell that? How can you not know that? Are you even God? You think one can have all the happiness if one just has the money? If one has money, he can have 8 storey house, AC car... ...a servant here, a servant there. One can buy farm, house and everything in between. If one has even more money, ...leaving father and mother, one can buy everything. Krishnaswamy. One can buy even you. Fine. What if you are poor? Krishnaswamy. Because you have Mahalakshmi[Goddess of Wealth] residing in your heart, ..you're a multi-millionaire. If not for that, you'll be a pauper. Maadhu... The world may be like you say... ...but I'm not like that. I do not discriminate between my devotees. Oh, stop it. You have discrimination within you. You know? You are offered butter in Udupi temple. But not even oil is offered to you in Halebidu temple. Arasikere Ganesha is grand. The Ganesha under the Peepal tree is meek. And you speak of discrimination. Fine, then. I thought of opening your eyes myself. But if I have to make you open them yourself, ...what can one do? Maadhu... Tomorrow... ...you will get 2000 rupees. 2000 rupees? Where will it come from, Krishnaswamy? From the account of your Karma. Save all your Karma and Dharma for Arjuna. When you get 2000 rupees tomorrow, ...what will you give me? You too have started taking bribes now? Right, right. I'll give you 500 rupees. Think again and answer. I'll give you 551 rupees. Including the money from the box. Very good. Then, ...all the money problems you have will go away from tomorrow. You'll be happy. Won't you? Come and see for yourself how I'll be living happily. I'm getting sleepy. I have to get up at 4AM and go grind the batter. You go get inside the temple before it opens. Otherwise, we'll read in papers that someone has stolen your idol and sold it off in America. Go, go. I'm a manual labourer. I'll get sleep as soon as I close my eyes. But yours isn't that easy. It'll be sunrise before you take off all those jewels and crown. Go, go. Goodnight, Krishnaswamy, goodnight. Maadhu. Tonight's sleep is your last comfortable sleep. How will you be happy from tomorrow? [Citing names of films]Wonderful player! Wonderful Cook! Good times!

In this life, ...I never thought we'd see so much money. Tell me, ...how did they give you this prize? What will he give? It came from my karmic account of merits, ...said your Krishna. You keep saying 'Krishna said'. Did you really see Lord Krishna? Or did you just see him in a dream? I'm deluded? I really saw Krishna. With my own two eyes... Va. De Krishna means... Vasudeva and Devaki's son Krishna. I saw him. Krishna, Krishna. You're a blessed being. Turn this way. Stand like that. Stand properly. May you live long with your husband. Do you need any other boon? Big devotees like Purandharadasa and Kanakadasa... ...singing thousands of songs of him... ...pleased Krishna. Even they had to go through many difficulties to before they saw Krishna. But he appeared to you so easily. To make him appear, ...did you sing any song? Which song? "He stole the sarees of women..."[A film song] "He won the heart of Radha" "Thief of thieves, Krishna comes..." Isn't the song good? He won't come for any songs. If there's any money to be collected, he'll come running. See... I had taken money from your God's box, right? That's why he came and woke me up from sleep. Now you see? Didn't I tell you that he won't rest until he recovered his money? 'Didn't I tell you?' You fool! When did he collect? When did I give? He got an earful from me before he went. Anyhow, that Krishna... ...blessed us with 2000 rupees. What did your Krishna do? I won it using my intellect. This is where you fail. When man is poor, ...his heart is rich and generous. But when he gets rich, his heart becomes poor. It's not like that. Do you know what I'll do with that money? The sweetmeat stall opposite Krishna Cafe, ...I'll buy it. You mean you'll quit your job? I quit already. Our Muddukrishna too would have said Ta-Ta to Srinivasa and be on his way home by now. How can you let go of a permanent job for a temporary joy? What if this joy becomes permanent? You don't know anything. Look... ...next Thursday... ...there is opening ceremony of Madhava sweetmeat stall. Is meals ready? Your favourite curd rice and pickle is ready. The same old curd rice and pickle even when we've money? I knew you'd say that. I've cooked something else for you. Then the curd rice and pickle? I'll eat. Look. Not just 2000, ...even if get 20 million, I'll still be the same. I won't change. Madhava Sweetmeat stall. [Maadhu Sweet Stall] -Muddukrishna. -What is it father? Did you pay the chit fund money? Yes. Maadhu. Are you well? Oh, Krishnaswamy. Welcome, welcome. We met on the roof last time. Yes, yes. Have this sweet. Why give me sweet? Why? You have Diabetes? Nothing like that. Why do you say no? Never mind. Krishnaswamy. How are you? I'll always be the same. I won't change. You mean I've changed? The way you sting with your words is stronger than scorpion's. You get upset when I am just joking. Never mind. I think I came at the wrong time. I'll come again. Wait, Krishnaswamy. Take these two sweets. One is for Rukmini and another for Satyabhama. So that it doesn't cause any problems at home. Hold your hand out. This is Avalakki. Not like the ones Sudhama gave you. Not those ordinary Avalakki. I personally fried them in ghee with coconut and cashews added. How is it? He's gone. I think he had come to collect his 551 rupees. Seeing the sweet and savouries, poor fellow forgot to ask. What did you forget? We had to pay 551 rupees to the ghee vendor. How much have we made till now? 316 rupees. Ok. Pay him this evening and get another 4 tins of ghee. Ok, father. Please sit down. I heard you have made big name catering to 4-5 parties. So, I came to you. 4-5 parties? Make it 400-500 parties. Have this coffee. It'll get cold. I cater to at least 100 parties a year. How is the coffee? Coffee is very thick. If you make it so thick, ...will you make money? Can we make it the same way for everyone? It depends on the person. It's only for important folks like you. Is it? Then... ...for others? How can we supply the same for others? For them, a quarter of coffee powder with 3 quarters of Tamarind seed powder. Yes. You know we make Badam Halwa. It has only 4-5 almonds. Rest is covered by peanuts. Milk is made with dairy whitener. Oil, adulterated. Yes. You saw today's Ambode, right? It was Pakora yesterday. You mean yesterday's Pakoras have become today's Vada. Yes, become Vada. Yes, bring them, grind and deep fry in oil and it goes on. If not for that, it's very difficult to run the hotel. I've to lock it down. Look. If you want me to 'look after' you separately, I'm up for that too. You mean... ...there's something for me. It's not that big a deal. This is nothing. Last time, ...a party similar to this worth 3000 rupees... ...a lizard fell into the sambhar. What can I do? I picked it up and threw it away. But the organisation's secretary somehow came to know of it. He created troubles in approving my bills. Would I let it go? Took him aside and greased his hands. And the bill instantly passed. This is all very common. But I feel scared. Why are you afraid? I'm here to give you courage. You're after all the secretary. You just pass my bills like that. I... ...will pass it you like this Are you married? Three wives and one child. Oh? One wife and three children. You haven't learnt anything even after having three kids. Look, sir. I'll give you 100 rupees as an advance. We'll build on that. And in 6 months you'll make more money than me. Then... Tomorrow... I'll bring the advance. Please don't forget. Anyway, you please give me your address. If you couldn't come tomorrow or were late... ...I'll come by your house. I'll leave. -Good, Namaskara. -Namaskara. Hey Maadhuraya... ...you dare compete against me? Look how I've caught myself a big customer early in the day. Arogyaswamy. Health Inspector? This fiend! Had to come here of all the places? And I spilled all the secrets of my hotel before him. -Little master. -Kempamma. Come, come. How are you? I'm like always. May God bless you. Little master, what are you doing? Exercise. What's the matter? Please stop it. Isn't master home? He's taking a bath. Oh, won't you stop? How's your milk business? Milk business has come down to a quarter of what it used to be. Why? Why? In our business, hotels are our biggest customers. I used to supply most of my milk to Krishna Cafe. But it closed down. I didn't know that. I wanted to ask your husband. Why have they closed their cafe from two days? They didn't close. Corporation! Corporation! Health officer came... ...and locked. How sad. What's sad in that? Little master. -You know what happened? -What? Without knowing that the guest was the health officer, ...he told them, how they make Pakoras... ...how they make coffee with Tamarind seeds. That everything is adulterated there, ...he told him everything without holding back. And got caught. Their business was down even before that. That was also because of you. You started selling good sweets and savouries in your shop. Customers started flocking your shop like flies. Is it wrong to compete in business? It's not wrong. God's blessing is on you. That's why health officer shut their shop. Kempi. Madam. What brings you here? Nothing, I came to see the senior master. What's the matter? Nothing. Can't you tell me? I can... Then tell me... Krishna cafe is for sale. I came to put it in his ears. Kempamma. How would one put such a big thing in one's ear? How? Little master! Look at him madam. Keep quiet son. You mean we should buy it? Yes. Yeah, right. What will the neighbours think? What will they think? If we don't buy, someone else will and put a military hotel(non- vegetarian restaurant) there. Yes mother. They'll butcher chickens and sheep in front of our shop. Blood will flow like water in gutters. And foul smell too. Please say yes. Krishna! Sir, ...please think it over. Srinivasayya himself has sent me as a mediator to you. What do you say Ambu? Under your Krishna's mediatorship, Kurukshetra war began. Under Kempamma's mediatorship, our hotel business begins. Sir, you arrange 10000 rupees. We'll complete the transaction. What about the 10000 rupees chit funds? When can we take the funds out? If you're ready to let go of 2500 rupees, we can withdraw tomorrow. Alright. Kempamma. Go and tell your master that we've agreed. I'll have collected all my monies. We shall finish this business tomorrow itself. Sir, I'll leave. I'll leave madam. Little master, I'll supply the milk to the hotel. -Muddukrishna. -Appa? Go now and look into the chit fund matter. -Yes. -Go! What do you say, Ambu? The hotel in which your husband used to grind... ...he is the owner of the same hotel. [Shri Krishna Cafe] Hotel seems to be newly bought? It may be new to you. It is very old to me. Oh? So...you do remember old things, huh? Krishnaswamy! Are you jealous that a grinder bought the hotel he worked in? No. You becoming the hotel owner... ...is happy news to me. Oh, don't I know? Your stomach is boiling with envy. Let it be. Why have you come at closing hours? I wanted to see the night life in Bengaluru. Before that, I wanted to see you... Very nice. Server! one special coffee for brother... ...for Krishna! Maadhu. [Shows 'no supply' sign] It's special service for you. No need. Why? You have blood pressure? Nothing like that. Who offers you coffee anyway? Why don't you drink this free coffee? Who is this coffee for? For Krishnaswamy... There's nobody here. It's ok. Keep it there and go. Please take it, Krishnaswamy. Tell me how it is. Because... ...in tomorrow's paper, I can put an ad saying... ...Lord Krishna himself had this coffee and approved. I can print your photo in the advertisement. Maadhu. How did you become the owner of this hotel? Oh, you changed the subject? Don't you know? Tiller gets the land, worker becomes the owner. Why couldn't you have written all these in your Gita? Listen to me Krishnaswamy. Adding all these points, release a new version of the Gita with newly added chapters. Thousands of copies will sell like set dosas. Never mind that. Tell me how is your family. Is everyone happy? There is no dearth of happiness. Everyone's excited about the future. The heaven itself has landed in our home. By the way, how's your Udupi life? Are Kumbaabhishekha being done? Are Tulabhaaras being done? Is money getting collected in your collection boxes? If the collections are weak... ...call for some Yagnas and collect some more. What need is there for all that? You don't know how to live Krishnaswamy. People are making money by printing the same Gita you told, you know? They are earning both money and merits. That was my intention after all. You just talk smartly. But... Like instant dosas and idlis, you barge in at any hour. Don't you have anybody of your own? You poor animal. I have no beginning and end. No father, no mother. An orphan. A wanderer without address. What Krishnaswamy? I know very well why you've come here today? Why? To collect that 551 rupees. Am I right? You thought of cutting into my today's collection. But that's not possible. The money I have is not enough to pay the instalments. How will I pay your 551 rupees? I don't need that money. Maadhu. I know very well how and when to take that money from you. I too know very well how and when to settle the dues. Right. I have to close the shop, you may please leave. This man doesn't trouble you. He listens to you. Please come Srinivasayya. Please sit down. It's ok. Please sit down. Are you well? How is Radha? She's alright. You might know about our situation already, right? My husband buying your hotel... ...I don't feel alright about it. I'm not at all sad about it. But... ...If Maadhu hadn't bought my hotel at that time... ...I would've suffered worse. Let it go. You seem to have overcome this somehow. I'll bring coffee. I don't drink coffee. Madam. I feel very hesitant to ask something from Maadhuraya. I thought of asking it through you. If you can help me in this... Please tell me... We are what we are because of you. Somehow... ...fate has kept us above and... ...you below. Let it go. Tell me, Maadhu comes home for lunch, right? Yes, he does. I'll look after the hotel during those hours. Madam, just one meal.. ...just one meal and some 60-70 rupees salary would be sufficient for me. I'll somehow manage to live on. You lived like a king. How can you talk like this? I have no other way if I have to lead an honourable life. Otherwise... I have to make Ambode, Nippattu and Chaklis... ...and sell them in Lalbagh park. Please don't say that. Life has... ...both sun and shade. Don't take this to heart. Or else I'll have to send Radha to work. Did Radha get her degree? No. My hands were tied. And she had to drop out of college. No problem. We can look for an able groom and get her married. I should've done all that when I had the chance. I can't even think of her marriage with these empty hands. Please don't worry about this. I'll tell my husband and get this sorted. I'll leave everything to you madam. Do whatever you think is right. I'll take leave. Tell her I asked about her. Yes. Looks like somebody had come. Our Krishna Cafe former owner Srinivasayya had come. Must have cried and told sob stories. What else can he do? Self respect on one side and hunger on the other side. Muddukrishna. Have you seen his daughter Radha? No. Haven't seen her properly. If you want me to, I'll see her properly. Not just you, I too have to come along with you. Most importantly, time must come. Amma, what's your intention? My wish... Radha must become my daughter-in-law and like goddess Lakshmi... ...should fill this home with happiness. I have to see. You too have to see. Mahalakshmi. Daughter-in-law. What's all this? All these letters have to be typed and posted today. Understand? Yes sir. Hello. What? Trunk call from Mangalore? You want Maadhuraya? It's Maadhuraya's secretary speaking. Wait a minute. I'll give it to him. Sir. Take it easy, take it easy. What's the matter? Sorry sir. Madhukar Shenoy has called from Mangalore. Take this. Hello, Mr. Shenoy. How are you? Fine. Jackson won the jackpot? Very good. What else? Thank you. Hello. Proprietor of five star hotel speaking. Sorry, his secretary speaking. Whom do you want? You want Maadhuraya? You call yesterday. Sorry, call him tomorrow. You'll get him. Hello. It's the secretary speaking. What? You want to speak to him? Call tomorrow. I visited Krishna temple. Take this prasada. Good. Thank you. What's special? Today is Krishna Jayanthi. Don't you know that? Oh, I see. Listen. Come home for dinner. Sir, apple juice. I deliberately left it there. How can you do that? Have this. It's good for you. Doctor has told that it increases fat in the body. Nothing will happen. The picture can hang only when the wall is strong. Keep on drinking. Then the wall drinks half... ...and the picture drinks half. What do you see next to you? You're right. So Ambuja, you say today is Krishna Jayanthi. Then you'll fill the entire house with his footprints. Yes. Why? Do you object it? Yes, this is costly flooring. That marble is from Japan. Japan? In this world, there's nothing more valuable than Krishna's feet. You mean our old house is better. Yes. We got here from there, right? I've bought that house only for you. And you can go there light a lamp everyday. Where is your dearest son, Muddukrishna? He went to the club with his wife Radha. They're little ones. Let them fly like birds... ...and return to their nest whenever they like. Yes, yes. Let them take time. I understand what you mean. Take your hand off! You act like you were married yesterday. We were poor when we got married. Even then, your cheeks were smooth like this. Now, you have a daughter-in-law. And even now, your cheeks are the same. Don't play games. Let me go. Back then, hunger didn't let me play any game. Now, even if I have such wealth and prosperity... There's still one thing missing. What is it? -It's been four years since our Muddukrishna's marriage. -Yes. There's no news of a baby. -No. -What do you mean, no? Isn't there your Krishnaswamy? Give him an application. Yes. You just keep seeing. That same Krishna will be born here and play in a cradle. Alright. I have no objection. But our Krishna must not tease Gopikas' like this. It's ok if the baby does it. But when you do it... ...it's not right. Her words are sweet but packs a punch. How are you Maadhuraya? Oh, Paramatma Krishna. Please come. What is this? This new honour of Paramatma? You called me Maadhuraya instead of Maadhu. Give respect and take respect. Because... ...you're a rich man you see. Hey! Get up! When you're meeting someone big... ...you must stand until they ask you to sit. You don't have any manners. What kind of a God are you if you don't have manners? Now you sit. Sit down, sit down. Forgive me. I just sat down thinking of something else. Oh, what's so important that engages your thought? I know. It's the 551 rupees. I'm sorry. I don't have even a penny now. I put all my money into buying this big Bungalow. Beautiful Bungalow. Don't think that I got this from your blessings. I... I worked hard and earned it. My work and your work... ...don't you know they're the same? Impossible. How's it? You too could've heard. People who achieved great things... ...say it's all done with Krishna's help. Is it so? Only those who think that Krishna and they are different... ...think that they achieved everything. Krishnaswamy! A man thinks he and Krishna are same and commits a murder. He gets caught by the police. Goes to court and jail. Only you escape. Then, you and him are different, aren't you? Not like that. Shadows follow you only when it's bright. Where will they be when it's dark? Maadhu. A washerman washes only your clothes, not you. But you still say that they're your clothes. Likewise... Your body is like clothes to your Atma. Sin is dirt on body. While removing it, ...only body gets punished, ...and not Atma. Nonsense! I don't want your Vedanta. You come and see my five star hotel. I thought of taking you there when I first saw you. You, a brahmin, came alone. I thought it was a bad omen. But I'm not a brahmin, Maadhu. A cowherd. I see! So, you too have these communal beliefs. No. A belief of Karma(work). A cowherd's work is to look after cows. Meaning, looking after all domestic animals. Maadhu. Creation is Brahma's job. Preserving is my job. Destruction is Shiva's... Your lecture is boring. Come to my hotel. I'll show you cabaret. I can't come now. May be some other time. By the way... ...when is your hotel open? and when is it closed? I don't know. It's not closed at any time. Krishnaswamy. Mine is a five star hotel. 24 hour service. He just vanished. He comes and goes whenever he likes. That's alright. Who is this? Someone new. She has come to swim. Japanese doll. She touched me. My life is fulfilled now. Sir, what is this? Will you please come out of water? Why? There are many bathrooms in our hotel to take an oil bath. Please come. Who are you to tell me that? Go mind your business. If you won't come now, I'll have to report to boss. You think I'm a servant? Go mind your business. Boys, drag him out. Welcome, Acharya. May God grant all your wishes. Take this. -Please sit down. -That's OK. We are happy that you visited the monastery this time. Don't say so. I'm the fortunate. Many monasteries have benefitted from you. It's all Krishna's blessings. What is my contribution in that? This Friday... Senior Swamy is visiting the monastery. You must come with your family. You don't have to mention it. We'll be present there in his service. Radha. -What is it mother? -Come here. My Daughter-in-law. Radha... Acharya from the monastery. Greet him. Hello, how do you do? Krishna... Bless her. Alright. Take this. Take it. May God bless you with a son. He wasn't feeling well from yesterday. I didn't know what to do. May he get well with this Prasada. Radha, put this kumkum on. Yes mother. Bye. You please don't mind her. She is like that. That's alright. At least she believes that the dog might get cured. That's enough. -I'll leave. -Alright. Krishna. I finally tied it. Radha. How is it? I'll tie it. You don't know how to tie a tie. I know how to tightly embarrass(embrace). Don't say anything. How is it? Eskalent!(Excellent!) I'll listen to your every word from now on. Be it tying the tie or my hands. You are ever ready for this. When will let go of this inferiority complex. What is it that you're saying? My god! My god means....my god. You! And I'm your god. Is it right? Nonsense. I don't know if you'll understand it even I said it in Kannada. Inferiority complex means... ...slave mentality. It means being like you. How is it a problem for you? -It is a problem. -What? I have to explain everything to you. I have to suffer you. Wherever we go... ...my friends speak English really well. But you keep gawking at everyone. I will lose my life saving you from that disgrace. Radha... Wise men don't speak much. I'm like that. Same fridge and volume. It's not volume, it's value. Why do you speak of something you don't know? I married you to learn all that, right? You should've learnt first and then married. Radha, no matter how much a woman learns, she's still a fool in front of her husband. ...It is my mother's opinion. That may be her opinion with respect to your father. It's different with me. Look, don't talk about my mother like that. Why not? She always meddles in my affairs. We have to go to a party today. She wouldn't let us go. Why? Some renowned swamiji is visiting, I'm told. And I'm to wear the traditional Kacche Saree. If I wrap that 9 yard saree around me... ...I'll look like a village fool. Radha... You can wear a saree or a lungi. Put snow on your cheeks or lipstick on your lips. Braid your hair tightly... ...or quarrel with your mother-in-law. But... ...don't forget that you are the daughter-in-law of this home. Mother! That... Look... Wear all the golden necklaces you want. But... ...nothing will equal this mangalsutra, you see. A woman must not think the whole world as her home. But think her home as her world. What is this mother? Whatever did I say now? Mother, she's still young. She'll learn eventually. Let her be for a few days. 'You must let it go a bit before you pull it back' Muddukrishna, you mustn't let it go too far. If you do, then it'll be difficult to catch it again. Can't catch it again, she says. Do you see how tightly I hold you? Yeah, very powerful. Maadhu... What's the hot news? Oh, come, come. Sit down. You'll live hundred years... I was just remembering you. Do you remember me? When such a blunder has been committed, won't I remember you? What is that blunder? It has come in the paper. A bus which was bringing your devotees... ...fell into a gorge... ..10 died and 30 have been injured. What is this? Do you need anything more dreadful? Krishnaswamy... Is this how you protect your devotees? Don't make haste... Read further... What else is there? Nonsense! "When enquired, it was found that the driver was drunk" There in lies the secret. Am I responsible for that accident? Just because one driver was drunk... ...why punish all the devotees? That... is their fate. Fate he says. They were coming to see you and seek your blessings. You brought such calamity down on them. Is this fair? Look Maadhu... A doctor... ...very popular... ...a very talented one too... A patient with a disease progressed too far... ...comes visiting this doctor... ...and dies at his door. Now would you call that doctor incompetent? You give the answers just like that. Forget about my smartness. How is your family? Is everyone well? Oh, everyone is happy. Just yesterday, we bought a posh bungalow at Palace Orchards. For our Muddukrishna. There is nothing to worry. But... This income tax keeps... Yes...yes... As the earnings grow... ...so would the sufferings. Look Maadhu... Instead of evading tax... fudging accounts... ...and hiding, ...if you are sincere and honest... ...you would have peace and health. Government will also appreciate that. Nothing like that. If we report less earnings and adjust it somewhere else... ...everything will be alright. Krishnaswamy... We can do anything if we have money. So, you still believe money can do anything. Why do you worry about what I think? Why?...You are talking to yourself? Look Ambuja! Look who's here. Your beloved Krishna. Take the measurements of his feet. Because... ...on Gokulashtami, you can print his feet as much as you like. Why? Why are you talking nonsense? Talking nonsense? Look at Krishna sitting on the chair. He isn't on the chair or the teapoy. You've gone crazy. You're talking nonsense. Krishnaswamy! Open your mouth and speak something! It's hot outside. Let's go inside. Looking at you talking to yourself... ...it seems like there's something wrong with your brain. Come inside. I'll put some holy mantrakshata on your head. What? You'll put holy mantrakshata on me? Krishnaswamy. Look what you've done to me. He vanished just like that. I'll take care of you someday. I'm scared. Why are you acting like this? You are scaring me. Ambuja. Your Krishna is truly a magician. Ah? Let him be. Let's go inside. Come. Hello. What? Is it Gabbunata, oh sorry, Ganganath stores? Mr. Ganappayya... Send the items over as per the list. Invoice it like I have instructed you. I'll come and collect the rest of the money later. Sir. Didn't I tell you not to buy provision from Ganganath stores? Who are you to tell me that? Who am I? I'm the manager of this Madhu Continental. I'm the supervisor. I'm above you. Go see your work. I know Mr. Srinivasayya. I know that. I have to do my job, right? You took 3000 rupees that day. Where is the voucher for that? Account? Voucher? Who do you think you are asking all this? You know who I am? I'm Maadhuraya's relative. I know. If he trusts you... ...Maadhuraya's business... ...will surely lock out. Let it be. Give me the account and voucher. Don't! Don't poke your nose in my business! Michael! Your time isn't good. That day, you stopped me from taking a bath in the swimming pool. Today, you are asking me for account and voucher! Why? You act so arrogantly because employees listen to you? Your tough act doesn't work with me. You think whatever you like. I have to inform the boss regarding these 3000 rupees. I have to fulfil my responsibility. What kind of boss is he? A tramp! I was the boss of your boss. Will you shut up! You shut up! Mr. Srinivasayya! I'll also see who's the boss. Get lost! Oh Kalayya! What's the matter? I wanted some money for my boy's exam fees. -Your son is in SSLC, right? -Yes. -Very good! Don't let your son become a cleaner like you. Educate him well. I've told Balu. Go and collect the money. May you live peacefully sir. Vaasu, Narayana, Krishna! Isn't anybody there? There isn't anyone when I need one. Vaasu, Narayana, Krishna! Maadhu. Did you call me? Oh, Krishnaswamy. Don't you know when to play games with me? I called my driver Krishna. You are Udupi Krishna, right? Udupi, Mathura or Dwarka...whatever it might be. I come to whoever is calling me. Yes, you'll come. You roam around all the branches. Forgetting the head office. Because it is a jail, right? If called, I'm ready to come there too. Yes, you'll come. What help can I get from you? I need to go to the Vidhanasoudha urgently. I need a driver. -You need a driver? -Yes. I'll drive. Krishnaswamy. This is not Kurukshetra's Arjuna's chariot. It's Impala car. Let it be Maadhu. Come let's see. You too must have a car. Krishnaswamy. Do you have driver's license? Because police might catch on the way. Maadhu, haven't I told you that I'm not visible to others? Yes, I had forgotten. However, you drive safely. Because, there are a lot of children in our country. They might run in front of the car suddenly. You are Kaliyuga's Krishna. Krishnaswamy. Don't turn the car towards Rukmini's or Satyabhama's house. Go straight towards Vidhanasoudha. Krishnaswamy. Do you know all the traffic signals? If you get caught by the police, ...I won't bail you out. Be careful! Krishnaswamy. I have some urgent business. Lock the car and give the keys to my driver. Thank you Krishnaswamy, tata! Whether you chide me or my father, doesn't matter! You have to dismiss Michael right now! What wrong did Michael say? He just repeated my father's words that one must be honest and just. Oh! Did your father earn all this money honestly then? Don't say that! He might not believe in God, ...but he has never strayed from the path of honesty. You mean? I am dishonest, right? All-right! I'll leave! Wait father. Please dismiss Michael. All right. I'll dismiss him tomorrow. Oh! Today I learnt that a woman's soothing words have so much power! Son-in-law, I'm not bothered about what Michael said about me. Just that he insulted your father-in-law, I couldn't bear it. And that is why I had to raise such hue and cry. Are you satisfied now? Yes, Maadhurao here. Are they calling me to auditor's office? I'll send the manager. Hello! Rao here. From lawyer's office? Contact them. Thank you. -Balu. -Yes sir. -Take it easy, take it easy. -Sorry sir. -What's this? All the calls are coming to me. What do I have you people for? To eat... Sir, that property tax case that's been going on... ...the way it's going, it seems we may lose it. -I wanted to bring to your attention... -Don't bring anything to me. You handle them. Then... What's happened with our hotel strike? Will the workers take back the notice or not? Till the time Michael is hired back... ...this problem won't be solved. If I take Michael back, my relative will go out! I can't say anything to anyone in this house! Everyone acts like they're the royals! Sir. Another thing. That estate we bought in Madikeri... ...there's a small dispute there. What is this? You're letting out one bogeyman after another. It's not me. It's coming on its own. Claiming that he is the owner of that estate... ...somebody has served us a notice. Idiot! What was the lawyer doing? Didn't he take his fees in bundles? Why didn't he check the papers properly before it was registered? My head is bursting! I'm fed up. Do you have the tablets? -It's inside. -Get it! What if I have so much wealth? I don't have any peace. What is it Maadhu? Oh, you've come. Looks like you heard what I said and you came. I said that just like that. Come sit down. Maadhu... Sir... Tablets. -Balu. -Yes sir. You go see your job. We want to talk freely. There's no one here! You mean we two? Be it two or more. That's none of your business. Get out! What is it Maadhu? You seem to be having a headache. Nothing to worry. I've just taken the tablets. It'll be gone. Krishnaswamy! I don't want your lecture today. Let's listen to the radio music. This seems to be T R Mahalingam's flute. You too have the flute. For what? Just to swat flies. Can you play like Mahalingam? He's playing because I asked him to. This is what I don't like. You mean to say he was your disciple? People are always like this. When someone makes a name for himself, people are quick to claim to be his patron. And say that they trained him. You too are like those people. What's the need for me? My flute playing is famous all over the world. "Krishna's flute's calling..."[a song] you mean this? Seems like no one can play it in Gokula? And since you're the only one there, they felicitate you as the master every year. I'll stop the radio now. Just play a bit of what Mahalingam played. If I play the flute, cows from the street would come into your house. Is it alright? Krishnaswamy. The cows won't come because of your flute. They come only when they see grass, bran or cinema poster. You play it without any worries. "The stove got lit after the cooking was done... One learnt his lesson after everything was lost..." ...is the proverb. You're going beyond the limits. All right. Your wish. Krishnaswamy! Stop it! Cows will come inside. I told you before. Did you listen? I won't believe this. This is not a flute. Some magic wand. Surely, you've got it from some sorcerer. This is certainly a magic wand, Maadhu. The melody that comes out of this... ...is holy Vedas to the wise men, ...and to wicked men, an enticing tune. Yeah, you say it like it's a cinema song. Let it be. It seems your work here is done. You may go. Why do you think I came here? I just said, by mistake, that I have no peace even with so much wealth. And you came thinking I surrendered to you. That's impossible. Krishnaswamy. There's always a challenge. Let's meet again. Bye. Krishna... ...forgot his 551 rupees today also. Mr. Madhavrao. You have high pressure. Which pressure? Blood pressure. He's always had it. Why do you worry? There are new medicines now. If you take them regularly, it can be controlled. How did I get it? Is it some birthday present to be gifted by someone? It's all because of your bad habits. What can anyone do about it? Doctor, he used to grind batter in my hotel. He didn't have it then. He left that and caught the pressure. Doctor has come to cure my disease. Not to hear my life story. -Do you understand? -Yes, I understand. Doctor, what all can he not eat? Rice, salt, spicy food and ghee. He can't eat these. You said it right. He has enormous fat. It has to be thinned down. We shall thin it down. But he should cooperate too. Srinivasaraya! He caught all these diseases acting like this. Tell me doctor, after making me the supervisor of his 5 star hotel, ..why should he meddle with it any more? He did it anyway and now suffers for it. They all came with you. Would you keep quiet until finish talking with the doctor? I may keep quiet... ...but your pressure won't let you be. Look at him! He always keeps shushing like this. I'm quiet. One minute. Keep quiet for just one minute. Why should I? Because I want to talk to the doctor. Whatever are you going to talk with your loudmouth? Can't you put a cork in his throat? Sir... Sorry sir. Stop! Doctor... How does one get this disease? There're only two reasons. One is money worries. Another is mental worries. I have neither. He babbles anything because of his pressure. Don't believe him doctor. Yes sir. Is there a schedule for one to know when the worries come and go? Is there a secretary to let us know its arrival? No. This mental worry is like a country's budget. No one knows what's in it until it has come out. Doctor. Finance minister would know when the budget would come out, right? That God is the finance minister. You mean one needs to go to him to know about this disease, huh? Shall I book you a ticket? All the products made in our hotel, ...must be clean and tasty is our boss's order. But Mr. Srinivasarao... ...asks me to use milk powder to increase the quantity. I said it's impossible. One day, he took an oil bath in our hotel's swimming pool. Krishna! When I told him not to do such things... ...he abused me, called me a fool, an idiot in English. Even after all this... ...one who got suspended is... ...me. Look, I trust you. Thank you madam. One day, my husband... ...forgot to bring... ...his 50 thousand rupees and you returned it safely. I knew it then that I can trust you. I don't think you're guilty. I'll send for you again. Now you can leave. Thank you madam. So, it's decided that I'm the guilty one. It looks so to me. You told to add powder to milk? Yes , I did. So what was he losing in it? He was going to use pure milk. I couldn't bear to see it. Shouldn't we safeguard our money from being wasted? If we use milk like he said... ...we'd have to shut our hotel business down. That if we aren't honest, ...we'd have to shut our hotel down, ...is something you already know. You have pleasure in reminding me of that, haven't you? If I had pleasure in doing so... ...wouldn't I have done that when you came to our home asking for help? Look Brother... I don't want to meddle in this matter. My husband's already unwell. Since I didn't want him to worry, I called Michael to enquire. Is this some court to conduct inquiry? Look Radha... Even our president had to come to the court for an inquiry. Do you know? The same president was declared innocent. You know that too, right? The judgement may differ in your matter. So, do we not conduct any inquiry at all? What is this mother? Do we subject our own to an inquiry? Can relatives and employees be equal? He may be wrong. But how can we let our own take the fall? Look, how does it matter if it's our own or others? Is justice different for everyone? Son... Your mother has a great devotion for Krishna. We have to hear the Gita. Is it written anywhere that we have to listen to all this? We'll stay or leave as we like. Nonsense. When the time comes, everybody has to leave. Not even an ant or a mosquito accompanies one. Oh, forget it. When we leave, elephants will come with us. But why should we go the place which you're talking about? Do we have blood pressure, diabetes or piles? Or are we crazy to talk to sofa and walls? Those who are, are still breathing... Radha! When your were unmarried, ...I arranged for your marriage. In return, ...you now wish for my husband's death. So be it. If your wish is... ...the God's wish, ...so be it. Well said, Ambuja. Well said. Looking at what's going on here, ...I don't know if it's a house or a fish market. Look... Aren't families like this? Arguments come and go. With the problems you have, why do you worry about these things? But our family wasn't like this before, Ambuja. Only after it sings that you know if it's a crow or a cuckoo. What's this Muddukrishna? What did you say to hurt your mother? No, father... Radha, you tell him. I didn't say anything. You tell him father. It's nothing. Your wife seems to think that I'm guilty in Michael's matter. Srinivasrao. I made you a supervisor only in name. Couldn't you have just sat and enjoyed ordering people around? Forget it. You scolded Michael and sent him out. Can you manage a five star hotel? Do you think this is Krishna Cafe? Krishna Cafe may seem to you lowly now. But don't forget that you used to grind batter there. One should also not forget that the owner came to the same grinder asking for a job. Maadhu, all this wealth has gotten into your head. And that is making you act crazy. This ego has caused you all your sickness. Your heart is filled with deceit and fraudulence. You are a charlatan! Srinivasrao! Hold your tongue! Hold your tongue! You call me charlatan? You call me a thousand names. I'll hear. Don't call me a charlatan. See Ambuja, he calls me a charlatan. Am I one? You call me a charlatan? You are a charlatan. You're father and his father are charlatans. Let him call you whatever he likes. Don't bother. He knows very well who is and isn't. -You come. -He calls me a charlatan? -Let him call, you come. Go, go! He keeps talking to walls and furniture and he advises me. I too have god. In a framed photo. Get lost! Ambuja! Don't be angry for what I say. I may be older than you by some 5-6 years. And it has been 5-6 years since we got this wealth. And within that time, I got 5-6 diseases. Though you have the diseases, let me have the pain. When one eye gets dust in it, wouldn't the other also fill with tears? We two are like that. Ambuja, you are healthy and fit. You know why? To save me. Who else is there for me in this world? Your care is more effective than the medicines. Ambuja... Ambuja... I... I will get better, won't I? Difficulties come to men and not trees. These things affect everyone. Don't worry. OK. -Go have your meal. -Yes I will. Take your tonic. Take it. Maadhu. Krishnaswamy. One of my devotees gave me this sweet pudding. I remembered you and I came running. Drink. It'll have too much sugar. I can't drink. Why? You have diabetes? Yes. -Can't drink coffee too. -Why? Blood pressure? Yes. Then you can't eat anything but rice. No, I can't even go near rice. Just wheat porridge. Wheat porridge to satiate hunger. And ice water for thirst. I can't touch ice water. Eosinophilia. Why do you talk standing? Sit down. I can't sit. You please sit down. Until the head of the family sits down... ...the guest can't sit down. It's not good manners. Is it not? Oh just sit down. Why do you torture me? But why are you not sitting down? Piles! You're the base of this world and I'm of diseased base. Ayyo Paapa ['Poor fellow'- Paapa also means sin] What's paapa? I mean... Usually the diseased people, ...say they're paying for their sins. That's why I said that. I don't think these are 'my' sins. Look Krishnaswamy. I who used to only walk, now, travel only by car. Weight increased. Pressure. I got even the bathroom air conditioned and drank ice water everyday. Eosinophilia. I ate Almond sweets whenever I liked. Diabetes. Owner of a five star hotel. Has friends among big people. Started drinking with them too. I ate chilli fritters without care. Piles. Krishnaswamy. I did these to myself. What is sin or merit in it? Then... You won't say that it's your sin? Definitely not. Fine. -Maadhu. -Huh? What are these medicines? These tablets are there to prevent me from making the final trip just yet. Could you say the names of these medicines? Why? Oh it's for you to use them when you're old. OK. Erythromycin. Ledermycin. Terramycin. Streptomycin. Achromycin. Maadhu. You said you won't say 'It's my sin'. But you said 'my sin' five times. Just in English. When did I say it in Kannada? What a devotion to Kannada. Doesn't matter which language, ...you said and that's enough. You just want to see me suffer and want to brag that you won. That's not so easy Krishnaswamy. Maadhu. I don't have to win you. You have to win yourself. You have something in your mind. Krishnaswamy. A word. Why don't you grant the wishes of everybody and let them go? What will you lose? I'm always ready to grant wishes. But... ...those who got their boon, ...misuse it and... ...turn it into a curse. That's my worry. How's that? You know the ant? It sat on a meditation. When I appeared and asked what he wanted, ...it answered, "Whenever I bite someone, death shall occur immediately". I granted that. What happened? An ant bit me. I killed it. Now you see? The boon it got turned into a curse. Oh! Because it asked "death shall occur when I bite", it died. You are very shrewd. Now if those who got their boon, turn it into a curse, what can I do? You mean? Hello. Is it from Bombay? Tell them I'm home. Maadhu. You can call directly from Bombay? If one has money, one can make a call to even America. Krishnaswamy. Make a call to Dwarka and talk to your Rukmini. Tell me the number and I'll dial it for you. No one should know my home's number but me. Hello? Right. Krishnaswamy. You dialled just zero and started talking? The solar system, the orbits all are in the shape of zero, aren't they? Hello. Hang up. Is everything alright? What is your family doing? Making Butter masala dosa. Then you have phone connection even in the kitchen? Good, good. Alright, then. You're not well. You take rest. I'll leave. Krishnaswamy. You're not forgetting to take back the silver tumbler you brought. Who will pay for the trunk call you made to Dwarka? Deduct it from the 551 rupees you have to pay me. Whatever he talks, he always ends up mentioning the 551 rupees. From Dwarka? Krishnaswamy has left. Oh, I'm sorry. Is it from Bombay? [Reciting Bhagavadgeeta- Chapter 6, Shloka 34] Krishna, ...mind is volatile. It is difficult to control it. It always follows its foolish paths. Mother. What? Where are you two going? Mother. Father would be comfortable if we put him in a nursing home, right? Why? How has he troubled you? What is so wrong with him that he should be put in a nursing home? Oh, he wants to show his love for his father by doing this. Go, go now. You and your smartness. To suppress that... ...is like stamping air. Mother. It's an impossible task. Mother. What? There's a bungalow lying empty in Palace Orchard. How would it be if we lived there? There is nothing wrong in it. But I have to know what's so inconvenient here for you. Nothing, mother. The disease father has... They're saying it's contagious. What did you say? You say his disease is contagious? I didn't say it. Radha told me. Not me. It's my father. Muddukrishna. Who are you saying this about? It's not wrong if Radha says so. She might just be concerned for her husband's health. But don't you have any sense? You're calling your father, contagious, for nothing. Krishna. You were young... Then... You had jaundice. You were very critical. Even when doctor advised him not to touch you... ...your father... ...held you in his arms day and night without sleep. Such a person... You abandon him now as a contagious person. Now you're 20, you act like this. Wait till you're 60 and you won't be like this. Because then there'll be another 20 year old to mock you. Go, go away. Set up a new family and go. Look, I'm your mother. When I die and you're called to light the funeral pyre... ...don't stay away from me. Couldn't you find another way to tell her that we wanted to move to the Palace Orchard house? I just said what you told me. You don't know how to talk. Just do as I say. Tell me. From now on, don't open your mouth. Good riddance! Mother. Give me that tumbler. Why? It's been offered to God, has it not? Then I want it. Give it to me. Bland porridge! What is this mother? Tell me the truth. You have been eating this for past four-five months, have you not? What's all this enquiry? All the members of this family, sitting on the dining table, ... are devouring anything they like. And when I call you to sit with us for dinner, ...you give this excuse of making an offering to God. You are doing all this so that we won't know. Am I right? If you come to know, ...you will feel bad about it. Won't feel bad but I feel proud. What is there to feel proud in this? I feel proud for having the world's greatest mother. What else can I feel proud about? Krishna. The day I married your father, ...my life became wonderful. When he cannot eat what he likes, ...why would I need this luxury? Whatever things he is forbidden to eat, ...I too have stopped eating those. Because... I am living in his shadow. Mother. Who, in this age, would thank the tree that gives the shade? They only see if it yields any fruit. Even if that tree gives shade, ...or dry up and expose you to sun, ...you're still standing with it. Who else cares like that? Fool! When her husband couldn't see, ...Gandhari tied a band around her eyes all through her life. What is greater than that? Mother. Making everybody call my father a mad man and playing with his life, ...That God! If I meet him, you know what I'll do? You'll ask for your father to be rid of all these problems, won't you? You're there to ask that. That's enough. No matter how many lives I am born in, ...I ask that you be my mother always. I ask this from God. Krishna. Yes, mother. This one word of yours is enough for me as a mother. Mother. This one word is enough... At the age of eating and enjoying, ...poverty didn't let me. When I got rich, ...health got upset, ...and the tasty foods are even further. Maadhu. You are talking to yourself? You came? Come, come. I was just remembering you. Please take this. What is this? You drank this porridge as if it was orange juice? When given with love, ...even porridge is like elixir to me, Maadhu. I didn't give it with love. I thought you'd say no. Krishnaswamy. In temples, ...people offer all kinds of tasty foods. If you partake of offerings made even once, ...no one will offer you anything from the very next day. Maadhu. When a mother feeds her child... The child says, 'I will eat only if you eat'. Then the mother, ...acts as if she took a bite and feeds the child. I am... ...like that mother. Ready-made reply! Comes without any delay. Krishnaswamy. I want to speak with you privately. What is so private? Nothing serious... Looking at me talking with you... ...everyone thinks I've gone crazy. My son, ...says that I should keep an ice pack to cool my head. My relative, ...says that I should massage my head with lemon and take a head bath. My daughter-in-law says that I'm possessed and I should go to Kollegala to be rid of the ghost. Hearing all these, ...I get angry on one side, ... and sad on the other. Father. I got your tablets. Why did I spin like that? Take your tablets. Did you see? I don't know when he will get crazy. Krishnaswamy. Why can't you appear to him too? Then he would stop spinning and giving me advice. Maadhu. When, where, how and whom to appear to, ...is for me to decide. Krishnaswamy. Your flatterers say that even for a leaf to shake, it must be willed by you. Then, ...you're responsible for all the merits and demerits of everyone. You're happy that you put me in a spot, right? Maadhu. Under a street light, ...one man writes a beautiful poem. Another, schemes for a robbery. The merits or demerits in these, ...goes to the respective person. And not to that Government established street light. Likewise, ..I'm like light everywhere. That's all. When you're everywhere like light, ...why is there a temple for you on every street? When there's water underground everywhere, ...why are there taps in the kitchen and in the dining room? Because, when one needs water, ...one doesn't have to go in search of it. Is it not? Very good! An answer to every question! Krishnaswamy. I too have pestered you with many questions. And have made you come to me quite a number of times. I'm sorry. I've decided to settle your 551 rupees today. Come on, sit down. Maadhu. I've decided to stop coming here. Why? -I haven't settled your dues yet. -No, Maadhu. I got the money you owed me. You got? When? How? Where? You had a cleaner named Kalayya. Do you remember? How do you remember all this? Yes, there was someone called Kalayya. Poor man, he died. Had you ever helped him? Yes. I had given some money for his son's clothes and education. I gave money for his examination too. Because, ...I didn't have money when my son was studying. And by the time I got rich, he was all grown up and ready for marriage. I thought at least Kalayya's son can benefit from my money... Do you know how sweet it is to hear this sort of news? There's no charity greater than giving education. Do the math. The amount you gave to Kalayya's son... ...is exactly 551 rupees. From today, you're free of debt. What is the relation between the money I gave him and the money I owe you? There is a relation. All the transactions of this world happens through me. I'm the embodiment of Dharma. Building a hundred temples, ...feeding a lakh people... ...and educating one man are all equal. Somehow, you got your money back at last. It's not like that Maadhu. I'm the bank manager. This 551 rupees that is deposited in your account now, ...can be spent happily in your next life. Alright. Now you can leave, right? Why Maadhu? Are you tired? Then what else? Asking stupid questions, ...drinking bland porridge, ...this naalige[tongue] has died. What did you say, Maadhu? I said this naalige[tongue] died. This naalige[tongue] died. Say that again. This naa..li..ge died. Meaning... Naa [I]... Illige [today]... died. You survived Maadhu. I'll leave. I won't come. I'm not your better half, bitter half. It's ok if you use English when you're scolding me. You use English to curse yourself too? You cracked a big joke. You laugh at yourself. I'll leave. Wait! You dirty woman! What arrogance! What indecency! You don't know how to behave or have learnt the manners. You're an incarnation of indiscipline. Go. Get the hell out here. Don't show your face and never come back! Radha. You know why I tolerated your behaviour? God would make the truth win at the end but waits. God sees the truth but waits. Tolstoy said this, you know? Radha. You insulted me because I didn't knew English? I didn't learn just the Guitar from the manager, Michael. I learnt English too to break your arrogance. My dear better half, oh sorry... ...my dear bitter half. Go to hell with your ego. Don't come back. Please forgive me. I know English language only and... ...knew no music. I know today that you know them both. Please tell me that you've forgiven me. Please. Radha. Mother. Take this. That bungalow's key. You both can happily move into a new house. I see that ability in you now. Mother, Radha is not like before. She's gotten wise. She won't bring this up again. From today, ...she's your true daughter. Mother. Because I studied in college, ...I thought I knew everything. I know that that is wrong. How a wife should follow her husband... ...I can learn that from you. Please forgive my mistakes, mother. Get up, get up, dear. Why do you cry? What has happened now? Don't send us to another home. Alright, I won't. From today, you are the woman of the house. I will just be with my husband. Muddukrishna. One should love one's wife. But that doesn't mean he should tail her and dance on her commands. Radha. It's true that wife should go out and enjoy with her husband. But she must not stick to him always. If the tracks started running with train, it'll be disastrous. You've become wise now. Go. Muddukrishna. I just now told you about not tailing your wife. Yes, you did. I'm supposed to go this way. -Balu. -Yes, sir. -Take it easy. -Yes sir. Look. I'm tired today. -I'll look at these tomorrow. -Yes sir. Sir. Madam has asked me to take the jeep and bring fruits and flowers. Can I go? A jeep to bring all these? What's so special? Today's Krishna Jayanti. Kodubale, Chakkali, Nippattu... Karigadubu, Kajjaya, Rave Unde... We'll offer these to God but eat them ourselves. May I go? Go. Krishna Jayanti. All of you eat all the sweets and savouries. But drown me in that bland porridge. Krishna, Krishna. Today's Krishna Jayanti. Why do you talk of such things? Once you get a little better, you too can eat them. Tell me what of today. Tell me what am I to do today. Look. I prayed to Kote Anjaneya and offered him a garland of Karigadubu for you. And had Mandalotsava arranged for Goddess Annamma. And sent money for Tirupati Brahmotsava. And in Krishna's temple, today's decoration is offered by us. Ambuja. Hearing you, ...it's like an innocent child showering kisses on me. Ambuja. Just today, give me a bit of curd rice and a slice of mango pickle. If you want, you can even wash the mango first. Don't even think about it. What sort of disease is this? What kind of a body is this? How heavenly will that curd rice be with a bit of mango pickle. Then... ...a strong coffee with sugar added. We've won our estate case. Lawyer has telegrammed. Didn't I tell you, ...that if we spend our money like water, we'll definitely win? We spent and we won. We spent and we won. I say you get out. I too was one among the men who think money can buy anything. What's the use if one has bundles of money? Can one eat them? When one is not lucky enough to eat what he likes, ...it's better to be a beggar than have all these riches. When I used to grind dosa batter, ...I used to eat curd rice. When I became a rich man, ...I lost the fortune of even touching it. Looking at this, ...it feels that it is better to live in a cottage. Krishna! I surrender to you now. You said you'd open my eyes through me. My eyes opened through me. Krishna, they were opened through me. That day, I challenged you. Today, I've lost. Have lost it. You're there in every being and everything. I'm a worm in front of you. What an arrogant man I am! And how compassionate you are! Krishna, Krishna! You won! You won, Krishna! You won, Krishna. You have won. Why these tears? Yes, Ambuja. Tears. But this... ...is the water that washed all the dirt off my heart. Ambuja. Ambuja. I want to eat curd rice and mango pickle today. Please bring some. No. I beg you, please don't. Ambuja. If you are truly my wife, ...you've to bring it. Go. Krishna, Paramatma. What test is this? I fall at your feet, please don't. Would you bring or not? Please listen to me. Go. Bring some ice water. It's for me. Go bring it. No. I feel scared. Will you bring it or not? -I will. -Go. That's enough. -Give it. -No. I have to wash my hands. Give it. Oh God! Ambuja. Bring me a hot coffee with sugar added. You mustn't have sugar. Just do as I say. -Why won't you listen to me? -Go. I must listen to her. Shouldn't she listen to me too? Why are you acting like this? You are doing everything the doctor has asked you not to. Don't know what will happen. That Krishna must save my husband now. I offer everything to Krishna! What? Yes, that Krishna will take care. You are saying this? Yes. What I'm saying now seems new to you. Srinivasa Nayaka who was known as Navakoti Narayana, ...didn't he become Purandharadasa? Didn't Meera drink poison with great faith in Krishna? Draupadi... When she called for help to save her honour, Krishna didn't appear... ...but when she said, her honour or shame, all belonged to Lord Krishna, didn't he appear and save her? Ambuja. Whoever understands oneself, ...Krishna has said, will have God appear to him effortlessly. That Udupi Krishna himself has saved us. He is so full of love. How lucky am I. I'm lucky too to have you as my husband. Muddukrishna, Radha. You two live here happily. From today, all my properties belongs to you. We always wish you well. This house will not be the same if you leave. Father, please forgive our mistakes. Please don't leave us. We're not leaving you. We're just going back to our old house. That is when I'll feel peaceful. Am I right, Ambuja? I knew that, some day, you'll decide to return to that house. That's not old house. It's my old school. I'm the student of that old school. Sir. Take it easy. My job? Continue your service to Muddukrishna. Thank you sir. Take it easy.
