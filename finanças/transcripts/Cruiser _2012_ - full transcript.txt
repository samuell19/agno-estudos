What are you going to say I was doing? Speeding? Cross one tire over the middle line? Something like that? Yeah, yeah. I know. It's all about money. I heard it all before. I know. You got to make your little quota, make your quota. Is that right? Economy ain't for shit. People ain't got no jobs. You bastards care? No. Hell no! So what? You know. You know what? Go ahead. Write whatever little ticket you want to write, all right, because I'm going to tell you this right now, I ain't going to pay it. I ain't going to pay it. I'm going to tell you that.

You ain't no fucking cop! You ain't no policeman! You ain't no fucking cop! Selah. Ten-four unit seven. Hi. I'm sorry, officer. I know I shouldn't have been going that fast. You think it would matter if you hadn't done anything? I'm not sure I understand the question. Do you think it would matter if you hadn't done anything? - Matter? You mean, like, having a reason to stop me? - Yes. Probably not. You're the law, right? You can stop anyone you want to. - I need to see your license. - Oh, yes, absolutely. That's my registration and proof of insurance, too. Tara Kirkland. Uh-huh. Oh, I hate that picture. But that's me. I need you to step out of the car, Tara Kirkland. Is there a problem other than the speeding? Would you step out of the car, please? - Okay. - Turn around and put your hands on the vehicle. Is that necessary? - It's the way things have to be done. - Okay. Hey, um... I've just got to admit, this is making me a little nervous. Oh. You're going to have to come with me. Are you serious? Why? Put your hands behind your back, please, Tara Kirkland. I mean, I'll pay the fine. You just... Put your hands behind your back. You haven't told me what the charge is. Both of them, please. Thank you. Officer, I have a right to know, don't I? Can you please just tell me why I'm being arrested? I thought you understood that it doesn't matter. What about my car? Can I have someone come pick it up? Look. I'm really sorry. I know I shouldn't have been going that fast. I was just... Trying to get home from a friend's house. She had this whole legal... Her deal with her boyfriend, and, you know? I was tired, but I needed to listen, so... We had a couple of glasses of wine just to mellow her out. Is that it? Did you smell the alcohol? Because I swear I'm not drunk. I don't do that. If I'm buzzed, I will not drive. Yes, I was going too fast, no question, but I have a really good record. You can look it up there on your computer. Not making excuses, I'm just saying. Any unit with a twenty on unit 22, please advise. Apb on officer Charles Tate. Shouldn't you call it in to let them know you have me? So is this the way to the police station? I have to post bail or something to get out, right? How does all that work? Again, I'm not saying that I shouldn't have to pay. It's just, money is tight right now. I'm a student over at pinewood tech. Dental hygiene. I was tired of dead end jobs, you know? I needed to make some money. Make some money sticking my fingers in people's mouths all day. Sir, sir, these handcuffs are really tight and cutting into my wrists. I know this all must be procedure, but is all this really necessary? I swear to god, I'll be no trouble at all. I just want to post bail and whatever, and just go home tonight. Enough excitement, you know, for one night. Dispatch, this is unit four requesting immediate medical and coroner on old mountain road at the old church. Possible officer down. Priority code two. Oh, man, this is a real mess. Ten-four, unit four. Is that unit 22? I think so. We need crime scene investigation and coroner, stat. You been drinking tonight, sir? No. Not at all. Well, just a few beers. Not at all, just a few. Which is it? Yeah, a few. Do you think it matters how much you're drinking, sir? Well, you see, officer, that's the thing. I've got a very high tolerance. And I'm, I'm really fine. As a matter a fact, I'm on my way home right now. Yeah. I could let you go. Oh, I would really appreciate that, officer, I really would. Like I said, I'm on my way home right now, I'll go straight home. Oh, my god. Oh, god. Can you just take me to the police station and turn me in? I swear I won't say a word. Oh, god. Unit 17, neighbor's report shots fired near parkside subdivision burnt hickory road. Is that near your twenty? Do you believe in god? What? Do you believe in god? I don't know. I guess so. That's not an acceptable answer. Either you do or you don't. What do you want me to say? Look, please don't hurt me, okay? Please. You can let me out anywhere. I won't tell anyone anything, I swear. Do you go to church? Why are you doing this? Tara Kirkland, do you go to church? Sometimes. When? Not a lot. Christmas. Easter. Do you go to church because you believe in god? I go because my mother likes for me to go. Why do you believe in god? Because there's a lot of good in the world. Compassion. Do you believe... God created the universe and everything in it? Yes. I don't know. I don't think it just happened all on its own. Do you believe that god is all powerful? Sure. How do you know that? I don't know. I think he wants us to do good, all of us. What are you doing? They're just kids out parking. What are you two doing out here? I don't know. Explain it to me. You've got to take all her clothes off to kiss her? How old are you? Hmm. How about you, young lady? Do your parents know you're out here? Then why are you hiding out here at all? - Stop it. - Get on the ground. - Don't do this! - Request medical and coroner on county farm road at the turn-out. Unidentified civilian with GSW to the face. Apparent severed extremities. Hands behind your back. Hello? Can you hear me? Oh, no. - Help me! He kidnapped me! - Ow! That hurts! Please don't! Unit 22, advise your twenty. What are you doing? Oh, don't do this. Please just let them go. No, don't do this. God wouldn't want you to do this. They're just kids. I know you had a reason to stop the other guys. I, I don't want you to do this! Please, no. Don't do this! Selah. No. No, no, no. Oh, god! Stop it! Oh, no. No, no! Why did you do that? What's wrong with you? You're insane! You're fucking insane! Oh, god. You think bad things only happen to bad people? Why do you keep talking about that? Quit asking me that! Answer the question. Do you think god lets bad things happen to good people? I'm begging you not to do this. Why does god let bad things happen to good people? I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. What's the only logical answer? Damn you! I don't know. Do you think maybe it's not god at all? Maybe it's evil or the devil if you will? Please just let me go. Please. Do you think I'm evil? I think you're out of your fucking mind. Do you read the Bible? What? Why? Do you read the Bible? Yeah. I used to. In Sunday school when I was a kid. Do you remember the story of Christ's betrayal? No. Judas, his own disciple, betrayed him. Judas revealed Jesus to the Roman authorities in exchange for 30 silver pieces. They arrested him. Peter tried to defend him. Cut the ear off of a Roman soldier, but Jesus healed the man. Dispatch, is unit 22 still Mia? Reattached his ear right there in the garden of Gethsemane. Affirmative. We have no twenty on unit 22. Do you know what Jesus told his disciples? He said for them not to interfere. That in order for the scriptures to be fulfilled, it must be so, he had to be betrayed. Judas... Hangs himself in shame, that he had betrayed his lord. And ever since, if you commit the worst kind of betrayal... You are known as a Judas Iscariot. Dispatch, advise all units switch to emergency frequency code bravo. He should have protected Jesus. No. He should not have. Do you believe Jesus Christ died for your sins? I don't know. Yes. Do you believe Jesus had to die redeem all mankind? A lot of people believe that. Then my question to you is this: Why was Judas considered evil... When he was merely doing god's will? Maybe because he was doing it for the wrong reasons. Huh. Doesn't matter the reason. He did what had to be done. Judas did exactly what god set out for him to do from the moment he was born... From the moment the universe was created. Come on! Come on, hit each other. My sister could kick both your asses! Yeah, man. You look like you guys are dancing. Why don't you hold each other and kiss? Yeah, slip her a little tongue. If I get a bruise on my face, my dad's going to want to know why. My friends are all giant pussies. Oh, shit. - You fuckers are busted again. - Man, you, too, asshole. Dude, if I get kicked out of school for this, you are all dead. Listen to me. Listen to me. I'll do anything you say. We... we can talk all night if you want. Okay? Listen, please. I want to know more about what you think about god. I want to understand. Please tell me what to call you. What are you boys doing out here tonight? We were training, sir. We want to be police officers. Tommy, shut the hell up. You're drinking beer... Thinking that'll make you police officers? Don't listen to him. Can you hear me? Listen to me! Can you hear me? Run! Don't do this. Please. Please just listen to me and run! He's going to kill you! Please, run. Please. - Just leave him alone! - Turn around all of you. Please just run! Run! Run from him! Please. Please stop. They will freak. My dad's a preacher. Run! Called him Isaac. And do you know what god asked Abraham to do with his son, Isaac? He... he's the one that god wanted sacrificed. Yeah. Please. But god didn't make Abraham do it. He stopped him. Take off your clothes, all of you. No! No. Don't do this to them. Please. Oh, god. Oh, please, please, please. Drop them on the ground. If any of you... Are still here in ten seconds... You will die. Turn on the car, god dammit! Damn you, you fucking piece of shit! Would you rather that I had killed them? No. No, of course not. Why do you think I spared them? Because you're a sick, twisted fuck who likes torturing people. No, why do you think I spared them, and not your friends in the backseat with you? I don't know. I don't know. Only you know that. No, god knows. You act like this doesn't happen every day to people everywhere. It doesn't happen to me. It doesn't happen to these people. Not in this town. What? What doesn't happen to them? Suffering? Death? Not like this. Do you think they have any say over what happens? Why do you get to decide? You do not get to decide. Do you think it's because you asked me to? I asked you to not hurt any of them. And why would you ask me not to hurt them? They don't deserve it. None of them do. Most people don't deserve to suffer. Right? But they do. God makes it rain on the just and the unjust. Why do you think that is? How the fuck do I know? Is that what this is? You're trying to make some damn point? Some people would say that the fact that god lets bad things happen to innocent people is proof that he doesn't exist. Maybe it does. Are you losing your faith tonight, Tara Kirkland? Maybe I am. Maybe I didn't have much to start with. Does that make you happy? Is that what you want to get to prove? That there's no god. Fine. Sure. Sure. I won't argue with you. You think that all this proves god doesn't exist? I don't know. If god does exist, how would we know he's all powerful? When he answers your prayers. Now Tara Kirkland, don't disappoint me. You're smarter than that. What do you want from me? What do you want me to say? What is the proof of god's power? He made the world. He made the universe. He even made you! Yes. Yes, that's my girl. My good smart Tara Kirkland. He, he even made me. And why? Why would he make you? Oh, god didn't make you. - The shit-eating devil made you. - And who made the devil? God made him. But not to be evil. The devil rebelled. And who made the devil's capacity to rebel? - It was his own choice. - It was the only choice he had. And that's the proof of god's power. You know what? Fuck you! Police cruiser 22, could you let me know your location? God is all powerful. He can do whatever he wants. He's going to be completely arbitrary. He doesn't have to obey the rules, not even his own. Pick up the radio microphone, press the button on the side - and respond. - He is perfectly good and yet lets evil run loose in the world. He is bound by nothing. So I ask you. How do you know I'm not an angel of god... Doing his will and reminding mankind of his absolute power? You're not proving anything but that you're a monster. People called Judas a monster. He was only doing what had to be done. Listen to me. What's your name? My name isn't important. Okay. Listen. I get it. Okay. I do. I understand. You've made your point. Maybe you do. But not them. Not yet. They know for god's sake. They know shit can happen to them no matter how good they are. My dad died of pancreatic cancer when I was 12 years old. We all know. It's god's world. Everything and everyone in it. And he can do whatever he wants with it, and we just have to accept it. Yes, you do. Please don't. Please don't. What if you're wrong? If god allows it to happen... How can it be wrong? Oh, god. Why didn't you stop back there? I'm sorry, officer. I was scared to death. I just wanted to go some place where there were people around. Don't you know you always have to stop for a police officer? Yes, I know, but my husband told me not to stop for anyone unless it's at like a gas station like this, some place well lighted. He heard somebody was out here impersonating a cop. You don't get to decide what happens to you. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Not trying to get away or anything, just going some place safe. What's your name? Cyndi Welch. C-y-n-d-i. - Do you need to see my license? - No. I want you to get out of the car please. Don't listen to him! Can you tell me what I did, officer? Doesn't matter what you did. I mean, you have to have a reason to pull someone over, right? Just out of the car, c-y-n-d-i Welch, please. Code one. See the subjects, teenage males, ridgeview road. Please, no, don't do this. No! No! No! Please, no! No! - Holy shit, did you see that? - Oh, my god. You're a fucking bastard! Shit, holy shit. He killed her. Don't do this. Oh, my god, he's coming in here. - What the fuck man? - He's coming in. Oh, my god. Will add one moment to your life? He who argues with god... Let him have his answer. No, no, no, no. No! Oh, my god, he's dead. Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Oh, no! I'm calling 911. I'm calling 911! Help, please. Please, wait. God, please, come back. Wait. Please. Stop it, stop, stop, please, stop it.
