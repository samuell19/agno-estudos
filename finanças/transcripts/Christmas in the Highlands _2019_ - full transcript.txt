So, whose the meeting with? Ms. Ferdi, Dragon lady? - Yeah, yeah, second thoughts Coffee courage. - How dare you produce these abysmal figures. - You know, we still have two weeks until Christmas. I have an idea that could... - Oh! And what would that be I wonder? To use our labs to produce your very own perfume formula. Because, well, you're a perfume maker, you're not a sales manager, right? And then you could bottle it and sell it at all our luxury stores. - You read my proposal? - She stood up? - Mmm hmm and said no, of course. - So what you gonna do? - I don't know. - Ho, ho, ho. - Ah. - [Santa] Let me help. - I wasn't looking where I was going - That's okay. - This is the worst day ever. - There's nothing the Christmas spirit can't fix. - I doubt that. - So, what's on your Christmas wish list, my dear? - Well, I'm certain it's nothing Santa's elves can fix up in their workshop. - Certainty is a sure thing. You can't be sure of everything. Even that your Christmas wish would not come true. - [laughs] Well, Merry Christmas. - [Presenter] Always love the local Scottish [mumbles]. [phone ringing] - Hey mom. - Hey, sweetheart, I just put up a new video. Have you seen it? - Great, can I watch it later? Of course, how's Finroze? Creating some magic, I imagine. - Like I said, I'm not there yet, I'm just a sales manager. - I don't understand why they're wasting your talents. - Erm, there's someone at the door. Hang on a second. - She's got a date. - [Blair's Dad] She's got a date! - No, no, I do not have a date, bye. [door closing] Dear Blair, what's for you won't go by you. Merry Christmas. [gentle Scottish music] - [sighs] Supper with Lady Murray. Come skiing with us to St. Moritz, Annabelle wishes to see you. The Blandford ball. Why is everyone always trying to find me a woman? Don't they know that you're the only girl for me, Lucy? Oh, you're so beautiful, hmm. [dog growls] - Your grace, have you seen the master's glasses? - Oh, I'm sure that as usual, they're on top of his head. Tabby, will you see to these please? - Don't tell me. I can answer them all for you like before. Engagements in Glasgow? - Mmm. - Chief clan delegations and business on the Isle of Skye? - Well, aren't I very busy? - Right, if you need me, I'll be walking the dog. Come on, come on. [Birds squawking] - Duncan. - I would know that voice anywhere. - As one of your oldest friends, I'd hoped you would. [chuckles] Here, I found these. - Thank you. Oh, that's much better, Ingrid. Sharp as a hawk. [giggles] 35,000 hectares and some of the finest Salmon fishing in Scotland. - I suppose it's lucky you have such a fine son to leave it all to. - To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? - My daughter's back home. - Ah, darling Kirsten. - Yes, and sadly been lacking in confidence since she and Alistair broke up. - Well, from my understanding, your daughter found love elsewhere and my boy felt assured of their incompatibility. His desire for the simpler things in life may not have satisfied Kirsten. - Well, as I understood it, Kirsten was waiting for the big romantic gesture. - Ah. - Alistair was waiting for your approval to give it. - That wasn't it at all. - Oh, how tragic. - Yeah, have I been short-sighted in - Oh, Duncan, possibly. Possibly. - It's the answer to all our problems. - Oh, this is utterly fabulous. Get it on my shelves by next week? - Next week? No, no, no, that's impossible. - Get it to me by Christmas and I may just ask my friends in Provence to take on a new perfumer, hmm? - I'll see what I can sort out. - How long will you be gone? - A couple of days at most. I've googled them. They're a tiny little workshop in the middle of nowhere. This is their big break. I offer them a whole bunch of money for the formula and they'll jump at it. Hey, mom, try this. - Oh, it's wonderful. - Wish me luck. [upbeat Scottish music] [upbeat music] Ow. [sighs] - That'll do, lass. Free WiFi, breakfast is included downstairs between six and nine. And best to keep the door closed. Keep Jack Frost out. Can get a wee bit chilly through the night. [sighs] [screaming loudly] - Excuse me, sir. I have no hot water in my room. I have been traveling for over 20 hours. Took two flights, two buses. I hit my head on a frozen window and I walked for what seemed like miles. All I want is a hot shower. - Sounds like all you need is a nice holiday. - And your internet is non-existent. I'm not from around here... - I would have never guessed. - And I need to contact the outside world. - By the outside world, you mean? - New York. - Oh, what brings you to Tillyfourie? - Work. - So it's not a vacation after all. - No, in fact I need to find this place. Maybe you could help me. - I'm not sure why you'd want to go there right now. - Not right this minute, but tomorrow. - Well, when you do go, you can take that road out there. Go straight for four miles, turn right at the crossroads. It's just a wee bit further up the end of the second road. - Right, good night. - Let it run. - What? - The shower. Takes a few minutes for the hot water to come through. Things move a bit more slowly here than they do in New York. - Right, thanks. - Well, I'm off Paul, see you Friday. - See you then, Alistair. [upbeat music] - Here we go. Thanks. No! [banging on the window] - Good morning. - I wouldn't bother, it's locked. - I should hope so. Even the Bonnie Highlands have their robbers. - You think they'd be open by now? - They're closed for Christmas. - Hello? So, you're closed already for Christmas? - We do take Christmas quite seriously around here. But since meeting you last night, after you'd traveled all this way to visit the perfumery, I couldn't just leave you out in the cold now, could I? - So, wait a minute. You own this but work at the hotel? - Yes, but, no, I don't actually work there, I was just having a pint with Paul. You seemed very distressed. - Oh. - Alistair McGregor. - Blair. - This is an authentic aromatic blend of fresh ingredients from the Scottish Highlands. May I? Heather, myrtle, rose. That's what makes it so special. I get calls all the time from big corporates wanting to buy it from us, but it's not for sale. I keep telling them every bottle we make is locally produced and sold. We want our customers to have a memory of the Highlands, not of fifth avenue. - Of course. - Some things just can't be sold. This one is called Heart of the Highlands. - I know. - You do? What? How on earth did you get a hold of that in New York? - Santa Claus. - Santa Claus? - Well, of course not, no. But someone gave it to me as a gift and no, I don't know who. - Intriguing, a wee secret admirer. So, what brings you to Tillyfourie? Certainly you didn't travel thousands of miles right before Christmas just to buy a bottle of perfume? - Certainty is a sure thing. You can't be sure of everything. Someone once told me that. But no, I'm here to check out the culture and the landscapes and wildlife. The otters, I hear the Eurasian sea otters are up here in Scotland. - So, you're interested in that stuff? - Yeah, I like watching documentaries. It's silly, I know. - No, no, that's not silly. Is that what you like to do with your free time? Watch films? - Yeah, watch films, make films. - You make them? - Yeah, I'm making one at the moment. - So that's what brings you to Tillyfourie? - Yeah, I'm making a documentary and I'm filming the landscape and the wildlife And of course, Scotland's only perfumery. You know, if you'd let me. Would you? - Certainly. Yes, the place will need to be spruced up if it's going to be on camera. - No. It's perfect as it is. - Exactly what I needed after an exhausting day's shopping. Such a lovely idea mummy. - Thank you, Kirsten, darling. I need you looking the most splendid because we are going to be spending the holidays at Glenmorie Castle. - How did you get the Duke to offer us rooms over Christmas? - Mmmh, I told him we were renovating our country house. - Is that all? Does Alistair know yet? - It'll be such a pleasant surprise for him, n'est ce pas? - He's stopped answering my calls and texts. - Look, when Alistair sets eyes on you again and furthermore, sees your University degree. - [Kristen] Degree? Where did you get that? - The interweb, of course. Your passion for Christmas. - Ho, ho, ho. - [Lady McLeod] Superb organizing skills. - What do I need those for? - The Lady of the Manor needs to be able to manage her staff. So, you have arranged for a custom made gingerbread house to be flown up from Harrods for the Christmas ball. - Whatever for? Don't they have one especially made by that lunatic baker in town? - Well, accidents do happen. - [Blair] So, this is a professional camera? - I made my first documentary on it. It is a little old, so it needs a good charge every so often. But, it's as good as the day I bought it. - Can you show me how to use it? - Sure, so, you press this to focus. You hold that for shutter speed and that is the iris. - Yeah, and how do I turn on the record? - [laughs] You're funny. Well, enjoy and have a great day. - Where do I switch the thing on? [car engine starts] Wait, no, no, hang on. I wasn't joking. How hard can it be? Oh, I thought we'd be filming today. I brought my camera. - And I thought, you might like to see where it all starts. You know this really isn't the way to see it. In Autumn, it's purple flowering and heather as far as the eye can see. Why did you come at Christmas to film? - An original perspective. - Aren't you forgetting something? - Oh, right, yeah. If you just stand there. - Here. - Oh, shutter off? Okay, erm. One second. - May I? I think what you're looking for is right here. [camera beeps] - Ha, right, it's just a new camera. - New? - Yeah, I left mine on the plane. - Well, you did say you had a bad day. - Right, so can you tell me what we're doing here? - All the aromas come from oils which are collected from plants and flowers found here in the hills. So, what you can smell right now, that is the essence that we try to capture in our perfumes. The nature here is very... Sorry, can I start over? This is for film, isn't it? I shouldn't really be talking about smells. - No, no, no, you're doing great. - I've never been interviewed before, so... - Well, how about you try talking to me instead of at the lens? - Okay. - So, can you show me what's in the Heart of the Highlands? - You'd like me to do that? - Sure, for the film. - Well, heather in Autumn always makes me feel instantly at home. So we collect some. - And there's something really distinctive about this perfume in particular. It's unlike anything I've ever tried before. Can you tell me what that is? - Ah, that is our secret ingredient. - And how did you come up with the formula? - I didn't, my mother did. - And when you... [phone rings] - Sorry, I should probably take this. It might be important. - Yeah. - Hello? - Okay, switch this. - I'll be right there. I'm sorry, Blair, we're going to need to stop filming. Our house is ruined. - I left it overnight and it just... - That was a gingerbread house. - One of the finest I've ever built. - Sabotage. - The room was locked until this morning, I don't understand. - Well, then what happened? - Maybe it was when I was out front in the shop. - You must make us another for Saturday. - Impossible, sir, with all my bookings before Christmas. - But it's essential for the ball. - Ball? - I'm sorry, Your Grace. - Your Grace? - Are you saying that you can't do it or you won't do it? - It's just a cake. Isn't it? - I could maybe make something smaller. - No, I'll make it myself. - Well, thanks for the ride and, sorry about your house situation. - Same time tomorrow? - Yeah. - Ah, Miss Henderson. I've been trying to call you. I've got some bad news unfortunately. I'm afraid we've lost all our electricity. We're trying our best right now to get it repaired. - First, no shower, now, no power. - It's been a nightmare, Alistair. This has never happened to us before Miss Henderson. Rest assured, we're arranging other accommodation for all our guests. - So, where's the nearest hotel? - Blair, why don't you come stay at my family home? - No, I couldn't. - Yes, you could. - I'd take him up on his offer if I were you. - If you insist? - I do. - Thank you, Alistair. - Are you sure you have room? - I think we can squeeze you in. [upbeat Scottish music] - [Blair] Are you a prince? - [Alistair] No, just an Earl. - Welcome to Glenmorie Castle. - Tabby will show you to the blue room. - Actually, the blue room's taken. - Oh, the pink then. - Taken, too. Those are both gone. - [Alistair] How can they be? - Your father has friends staying. - Tabby. - It's fine, really, I can find somewhere else. - You certainly can. When the master phoned ahead, I took it on myself to prepare the gold suite. - Good. - Oh, now that sounds like my kind of room [laughs]. - I've been looking after young Alistair since he was a wee boy. Always such a sweet natured and generous lad. Now, my dear, you let me know if I get you anything, anything at all. It's awfully nice to have some female company for a change, I must admit. - Well, if you could show me the kitchen or something, I'd love to make a bagel. - No need, you're a guest of the Earl's. Dinner will be served at eight. Informal dress. - Hah, not this casual, right? - [laughing] Your bags will be up in a moment from the B&B, Miss Henderson. Don't worry. Here we are. [upbeat music] [squealing loudly] Ohhhhh. [phone buzzing] - Finally, you haven't been picking up your phone. What's happening? - Not much, progress has been a wee bit slower than I'd hoped. - [Amber] Wee? - It's Scottish for small. - [Amber] What's the word for large? Where are you? It looks like a palace. - Oh, a castle. - Girl, you've got some explaining to do. - Get this, the owner of the perfumery lives here with a butler, a valet, the Duke, the cutest housekeeper. - [Amber] Blair, wait, are you staying there? - Well, yeah. [giggles] - How did you manage that? Wait, is he like a prince or something? - No, he's not a prince. - [Amber] I can always tell when you're keeping something from me. - You can? - [Amber] So, he is a prince? - No, no, no, he's not a prince, he's just an Earl. - Oh my god, would you listen to yourself? Wait, so what are you doing staying in this castle? - Okay, so, he won't sell the license to anyone. So I may have told him I'm making a documentary. - A documentary, are you crazy? - I know, I panicked, I was put on the spot. I thought it was a way of learning how to get the formula, so I could come home. - Or you could just come home and tell Ferdi that you can't get the license. - Are you crazy? And lose my job? This is my golden ticket to making a perfume for my mom. No way. Amber, promise me, please, you won't tell dragon lady. I need just some more time to get the recipe. [door knock] - [Butler] Your luggage, Miss. - Oh, coming. I have to go, I have been invited by the Duke for dinner. - Don't you dare hang up on me. - Sorry [balls popping] - Father, are you in here? Robert. So, you're the surprise. - Surprise? I don't know anything about surprises around here. This place looks exactly like it did 400 years ago. - Well, in that case, you should put on some old clothes, there's plenty of work to be done. - Al, you know I don't get my hands dirty. - Oh, don't be modest, Robert. You're a city trader. Your hands are much dirtier than mine. - Well you don't keep a dog and bark. Hey, Lucy. There's plenty of other people around here willing to help. - [Alistair] Come on. - Well, father must be thrilled. Both boys home for Christmas. - Oh, have you seen his glasses? - No, haven't seen him yet either actually. - Up on the roof. - Taking in your future baronial estate? - Taking in the bird life more like. All this, would never suit you anyway. - No, no it would not. Not unless it was turned into a golfing complex. 18 glorious fairways meandering their way through the estate. I live in the modern world. - Of course. - This place, it's a tired, drab, dusty old mausoleum. - Then I'm surprised you keep coming up. There must be something here bringing you back every Christmas. - What can I say? I love the season of good will. - Yes, I'm sure, it has nothing at all to do with the Bevy of Scottish noblewomen at the ball. - It might just have a little something to do with it. - Hmm. - This was before you two were even a twinkle in my eye. But it was in Loch Fyne and it was this big. - Father, may I introduce Blair Henderson. My father, the Duke of Glenmorie. - Delighted to meet you. - Your Grace. - [laughing] No, no. - This is Robert. - Alistair's younger and better looking sibling. - [laughs] Robert. - So pleased you could join us for dinner. - Yeah, I'm sorry I'm a bit under-dressed. - [Robert] Nonsense. Where have you been keeping this gorgeous creature? - I'm a bit short on clothes. - And cameras, but you look lovely. - I hope your room is comfortable for you. - Oh, oh yes, very, very Your Grace. This castle is magnificent. - Well, shall we take our places at the table? - Yes. - Okay. [gentle music] - Is someone else joining us? - Ah, there you both are. - Good evening. - Simply ravishing, both of you. - Lady Mcleod, Kirsten. My father should have told me you were coming. - Their home is being renovated at the moment. - Yes, I think I read in Highland Life that there were building works happening in Windrush House last year. - Oh, delays. - So many delays. - Well it seems our Alistair has been checking up on Kirsten. So you'd know that she's just returned from Oxford University with a post-graduated degree in... What was it again? - English Literature. - Yes, so impressive. Now, let's toast to that. - Cheers. - Slàinte Mhaith. - Slàinte. - Slaanngee. - Blair is here working on a film. - Oh, a movie? - More a documentary, for online. I take after my mother. She's always making these videos that go viral. - [Alistair] And she's going to include the perfumery. - I thought that was just mother's little pastime. You're not still keeping that going, are you brother? As long as mother was mixing her oils, she was happy as a lark. - Happy as a... Did you know that larks are philopatric? Return to their birth place each year every migration. - The males more than the females. Which is unusual, you would assume the women were more the homebodies, but that's not always the case. - Indeed, yeah, very good Miss Henderson. - Duncan, you wished to discuss the Christmas ball. - Quite right, quite right. - I've arranged for a string quartet from the National Orchestra to play a couple of songs. - What a treat. You two always worked so well together. You must do so again this year. Put on the best ball this castle has ever seen. - Well, actually, I'm quite busy at the moment with the documentary, so... - Oh no, don't let me get in the way. Christmas is really not my thing. - Mmm. - Ah. - Blair, how are you enjoying the cuisine here? - It's different to what I get back home. What is it we're eating, Your Grace? - It's a small four-legged animal found in the Scottish Highlands. The legs on one side are shorter than on the other so it can easily run in circles round the mountains. Makes it easier to catch too. - Father always tells this story every time we have haggis. - Well, I've never eaten a haggis before. - [Clears throat] This one. - Mmmm, it's not bad. - It's pointless, he's clearly over me. - Never, no, our only problem is this little busybody whoever she is. Claire something? - Blair Henderson. - Blair, what a ridiculous name for a woman. - And what is Miss Comfort-Over-Style over my special alone time with Alistair? - Oh, she is trouble. We have to find a way of shipping her back across the pond before Saturday. - Or flying her? Well, how do we do that? - We find out who she's making this film for. Get onto the inter web and goggle her. - Google. - Well, whatever. - Blair Henderson documentary. - Documentary is spelt with an A, darling. - [Kristen] Nothing. - Well, there must be something. - Ah, what do we have here? Hmmm. - [Mrs. Ferdi] Where is it? - I'm working on it. I need some more time, but I am working on it. - Blair, get me Heart of the Highlands. Do you hear me? - Yes, yes, I understand. - Good. - I'm... [phone disconnects] I'm on it. [sighs] [pots and pans cluttering] - Oh, hi. Sorry, did I wake you? - No, I was already awake. Jet lag. What are you doing? - I'm making the gingerbread house. Well, trying to. To be honest, I rarely set foot in the kitchen. This is the kitchen, isn't it? - [laughing loudly] I think this calls for an expert. - Oh, and who would you suggest at this hour of night? - Oh oh. - Today we are going to... - 800,000 views? - Oh, my mom's pretty special. - To begin with, we need to melt the butter, the sugar and the syrup in a pan. - Worth a try? - Yeah. - Right, I'm on eggs, milk? - Yes. - Your family is so nice. They've been really welcoming. - Well, I wasn't expecting the others tonight. Lady McLeod is an old family friend and Kirsten and I went out several years ago until she dumped me. - She dumped you? - Oh, yes, for a bigger, better deal with a yacht. - Well, I find that hard to believe. - Which part? That Kirsten and I dated or that there's someone better than me? - Mmmh. I think that's done enough. Yeah, do you have shapes? - Yes. - We're gonna cut round the triangle. - What about you? - What about me? - Your boyfriend? The one who gave you the perfume? - I don't have a boyfriend. Oh, and if it was secret Santa who gave me the gift, I definitely didn't sign up for it. - You really dislike Christmas that much? - Oh, my dad calls me scrooge. - Ouch. - It's just Christmas is so much stress. It's all about sales, sales and more sales. - You know, in Scotland it wasn't a public holiday until 1958, so you would have been in good company back then. - You're kidding? - No, right. Christmas was banned here for 400 years. My mother always loved the magic of the holidays and she taught my brother and I the importance of all that. Now we carry on her tradition every year with the Christmas ball. - Oh, so now I feel bad. I'm sorry what I said over dinner. Just cause I don't like Christmas, doesn't mean I should spoil it for everybody else. So you think the gingerbread house was sabotaged? - Who knows? Kirsten seems to have one on order from London. - And if it's not made here in the Highlands? - Are you mocking me? - No, no, not at all. - It's time to start building those walls, my friends. - So this is where you make the Heart of the Highlands? - Yes, this is where we mix the perfumes. We use the process of solvent extraction, which means we take the heather, we pour benzene over the flowers. And that creates this waxy material. This was actually made with locally grown roses. Next comes the sticky stuff. We add that to the tub of ethyl alcohol and we heat it. 200 degrees for five hours. - Wait, isn't that too hot? Isn't it better to be at a lower heat for eight hours. - You know that, do you? - I read a book on it. - Hmm, yes, you're right. Of course, you can do that at a lower heat. The alcohol evaporates and what's left is the concentrated perfume oil. And when that's completed, we can mix. - And how do you know what quantities to mix? - No one gets a hold of that. - Well, how do you know if you have the right combination? - Oh, it's all in my head, don't worry. Especially Heart of the Highlands. I remember the day that my mother created it. There was this excited shriek from the other room and Robert and I rushed to see who would be first to try the new perfume. I won. She wore it every day from then on until she died. - Well, you know maybe that's why you don't like so many people wearing it. It was just so special to her. - Maybe. Shouldn't that be... - Yeah [giggles] - So, how does it all look? - Great. - Great. Actually would you mind continuing the interview at my next appointment? Preparation for a Christmas ball never ends. [gentle music] - There you are, darling. Oh, it's only you. - Kirsten, who were you looking for? My older and less charming brother? - Is he around? - No, he is not. Are you sure you want to be chasing Alistair again? - I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. - Our parents playing matchmaker between the two of you. - You're just a little bit jealous, Robert. - As are you, of our American friend, the filmmaker. - She's not a filmmaker. - What the devil does it matter what she is. Everyone can see Alistair is smitten with her. - Well, I wonder if he would be so smitten with her, if he knew that she works for Finroze. - [sighs] And what on earth is Finroze? - Only the best perfume brand in the world. I wear their scents all the time. If she works for Finroze, it can only mean one thing. - Yes, yes. - She's after your mother's perfume, which means - Which means, our product must be somewhat more valuable than I first gave it credit. - For even the biggest grinch, picking out a Christmas tree is fun. You can't tell me you're not enjoying this at all? - Well, when I was a kid I watched a documentary about all the animals that relied on fir trees for survival. And since then, I've insisted my parents only use artificial. - You really do care about wildlife. [laughing] - Well, what about this? Does this work? - A handsome tree but not fit for a ball - [laughs] Okay. - So, what was it then? - It's just the demands and expectations this time of year. - You mean it's too commercialized? - Yeah, something like that. - Have you always felt like that? - Not always. I mean, as a kid I loved it. Obviously, but, I guess now Christmas is just a reminder of another year where I'm further away from achieving my dreams. - Well, why is that? - I'm a small cog in a big wheel and it's... I guess it's not my turn yet. - Well, obviously I don't know anything about the filmmaking stuff, but whatever it is, just go for what you want. Instead of using Christmas as a bad reminder, why not let it be a kickstart to a brand new beginning. - You really do love Christmas, don't you? - Yeah, I really do. Especially as an Earl, there are certain perks. In fact, I just received a special invitation to a private tasting with the Highland Chocolatier. - Did you say chocolate? - Hmm, yeah, but you wouldn't be interested. There'll be jolly music, mulled wine, chocolate reindeer, It'll be awful. - Now wait a minute, like you've been really helpful with my documentary. I think it's only right that I help you out with some chocolate tasting. I mean I can be really useful. - Well, that's very kind of you. - Well, it's just a little thank you. - This one. - Yeah, this one. ♪ Don't care for presents or treats ♪ ♪ I'll throw a party ♪ ♪ But it's only for two ♪ ♪ We can jingle bell rock ♪ ♪ I got the measure of you ♪ ♪ Honey you know your love is too good to miss ♪ ♪ Well, this year I have only one wish ♪ ♪ So hear me say it ♪ ♪ Get on your sleigh ♪ ♪ Don't think Santa would mind ♪ ♪ If you could borrow his ride ♪ ♪ Get on your sleigh ♪ ♪ Boy your lips are delicious ♪ ♪ Give me kisses for Christmas ♪ ♪ The fire's burning and I filled up your glass ♪ ♪ Won't you hurry right here ♪ ♪ I'm in the mood for romance ♪ ♪ Come take me under the mistletoe ♪ ♪ And let me know that this feeling will last ♪ ♪ Honey you know your love is too good to miss ♪ ♪ Well this year ♪ - Will you at least tell me where we are going? - You wander into the shop as if fate itself decreed it.

You bump into each other and you pretend like it's an accident. You say, what are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - No, no, softly. What are you doing here? - Right. Alistair, what are you doing here? - Kirsten, I was just enjoying a chocolate tasting with Blair. - Hey, it's amazing in there. The chocolates are to die for. Have fun. [upbeat music] - [Blair] Where are we going? - You'll see, you're gonna love this. - This is where we're going? - I haven't been here in over 10 years. - [gasps] Wow. [gentle music] - This is where my mother used to come and play and create her perfumes. It was her private space. My dad built it for her as a wedding present. - It's beautiful. May I film? - That's why I brought you here. - So, here we are at the secret perfumery at Glenmorie Castle. Okay. - Oh, [clears throat]. In here is where the first Highland perfumes were created including the original Heart of the Highlands perfume by my mother, the late Duchess, Candace McGregor. [camera beeps] - Oh, shoot, the battery's died [sighs]. - Oh. - Can I? - Of course. - Okay. - Well, perhaps I could let you in on why this perfume is so special. - The secret ingredient? Yeah. - In here is the oil of a rare thistle. My mother found it on the Isle of Skype and when she did she knew she had the perfect mix. - This is the head note. It's the sweetness. [phone ringing] Your phone. - Yes. - Your phone. - My phone. And it's my dad demanding my attention. I should probably go and see what the old man wants. - Of course, I've taken up way too much of your time. - But, please, you can stay here. If you like, you can try for yourself to make something. - Really? You trust me? - It's about time someone used this place again. It's been far too long. - Thank you. - I won't be long. [squealing] - Better hide yourself. Thelma and Louise are chasing you. - So that's where you've been hiding. Lady McLeod and Kirsten have been looking everywhere for you. We need to talk to you about catering. - It's... - I tried to warn you. - Well? ♪ Well, I know it's close to Christmas ♪ ♪ But I need to change your mind ♪ ♪ Cause I know I've been a troublemaker ♪ ♪ I wanna make things right ♪ ♪ Well I misbehaved in April ♪ ♪ And I broke a heart in May ♪ ♪ September wasn't all that good ♪ ♪ But I hope I'm not too late ♪ ♪ I try ♪ ♪ And I try ♪ ♪ Can you take me off your naughty list ♪ ♪ I'll be your Santa baby with a kiss ♪ ♪ I try ♪ ♪ And I try ♪ ♪ I'm a little misunderstood, believe me ♪ ♪ I try to be good ♪ - Mom, this is definitely for you. No, Amber, I won't do it, I can't. - [Amber] Blair... - No, it's too important to Alistair. It was his mom's. It's part of the history here. - [Amber] Blair, you said so yourself. Ms. Ferdi won't take no for an answer. You know the formula now, just hand it over and get your dream job. - I won't do it. I'll just tell her how I can save Finroze, without the Heart of the Highlands. She'll understand. - [Amber] So now you believe in Christmas miracles too? That Irish air is going straight to your head. - Scottish, Amber. I'm in Scotland. - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. - No, no, not at all. We were just finishing. Thank you. - I just wanted to give you this. It's a little farewell thank you gift. - Oh, it's lovely. But you're not leaving? - The film's complete. - But you can't be finished. Not until you film a room full of sweaty men in skirts. - What? [ceilidh music] [crowd cheering] [ceilidh music] [crowd applauding and cheering] - Kirsten, how are you? - Lady McLeod, this is so much fun. Do you do this every year? Well, I needed a rest anyway. - Duncan. - Oh, how lovely to see you. - I hope your filmmaker doesn't turn out to be a trouble maker. - I don't think she's been any trouble at all. I'll no have a thief in my house. - Jake, yes, not bad. Listen, I might just have a little early Christmas present for you. Well, the stock is somewhat different to our norm. - Are you enjoying yourself, Miss Henderson? - Oh yes, Your Grace, the best. - Good. My dear, then it's such a shame that you have to leave us so soon. - Well you know I could stay... - Kirsten and Alistair would have thoroughly enjoyed having you attend their Christmas ball. - Their ball? - Perhaps though you could return to film the wedding. The coming together of two of the oldest houses in the Highlands. The McGregors and the McLeods. - Yeah, yeah, yes, I suppose I could do that. - Good. - Oh, would you excuse me one moment? - Of course. [gentle music] - Leaving so soon? - Ahh, whoa. - Ooo. - Well, the documentary is complete and I gotta get back to my parents before the holidays. - Without even the courtesy of a goodbye. - Thank you. Thank you for everything. - Can I help you with your bags? - Honestly, no, it's fine. I just got these. Okay, Merry Christmas Alistair. Have a good one. - Merry Christmas. [gentle music] [car engine] - Goodbye Scotland. Just when I was starting to like Christmas. [tire pops] What was that? You have a spare, right? - Sorry, Miss. I don't. - You're kidding me. [phone rings] - You didn't get very far, did you? - No, we are stuck on a road in the middle of nowhere. The cab driver has no spare, no tire, no jack. No sense, no phone. - I'll be right there. Any idea where you are? - Well, there are some trees and there are lots of fields. It's pretty wet here. Wait, no, no, no, come back, I need that. I need my bag, I need my purse. Oh, Oh, Oh. So how did you find me? - I found you because you were on the one road in to town. Now, explain this to me again. A reindeer stole your bag? - It's ridiculous, I know. - And what was in the bag? - Everything, my wallet, my passport... - Your carrots. - This isn't funny. What am I gonna do? You do believe me, don't you? - Let's just get you back on the road. [sighs] - I really appreciate you doing this. - Well, I couldn't leave you stranded. Look, if we can get you to the Edinburgh embassy in the next four hours, you'll be fine. - Four hours, ugh. - Your perfume, what is it? - Just a little gift I made for my mother. - You made that? - Yesterday. - Blair, it's beautiful. Have you ever thought about working in perfume? - Oh, watch out. [car screeching] Right. - Right. Stay in the car, I'll handle this. - No, I can do it. - But... - Okay, hello, Mr. Cow, Mrs. Cow, Master Cow. It would really help me, I'd love to stay and chat. But if you could just move, move over. Oh, good, good. See, that's easy. No big deal. Alright, come on, go this way, go this way. Oh, oh my God, oh my God. - It's all right, it's all right. All right, everyone, we mean you no harm. Move along. All right, I'm sure you have better things to do than to deal with us. Go on. You did well, you did well. - What a day. Well, I told you it was getting late. - I really thought it would be open until five. - Apparently not during the holidays. You need to be getting back. - Well, I can't just leave you here. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. And besides, it would be madness to try and drive back to the castle now at this time of night in this weather. - But the Christmas ball? - If I can leave by 10 tomorrow, I'll be back with plenty of time. Come on. - Well, I have never been to Edinburgh before. - It's a wonderful city, you'll love it. - Yes. - You know what we should do? - What? - We should go to the Christmas market. - The Christmas market, you really wanna push this Christmas thing.. - [laughs] I really do. ♪ Well, Santa don't you take too long ♪ ♪ Sleigh bells playing a familiar song ♪ ♪ Oh I can't wait for Christmas eve ♪ ♪ When underneath my Christmas tree ♪ ♪ There'll be presents wrapped in ribbons for me ♪ ♪ So many gifts my eyes can barely see ♪ ♪ Hanging up my mistletoe ♪ ♪ It's a wonderland ♪ ♪ When it starts to snow ♪ ♪ Oh, Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ I hear Santa call ♪ ♪ I said oh, Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas one and all ♪ ♪ Children playing with their brand new toys ♪ ♪ All the happy little girls and boys ♪ ♪ So much joy for all to see ♪ - So are you sure you'll be okay? - Absolutely, I'm just gonna tell them I had my passport stolen... - You might want to change the reindeer part. People are such non-believers these days. - Why? Well, you don't want to be late. - Right, well, goodbye then. - Goodbye. No, I'm gonna go. But, thank you, I have to go. - Blair, why don't you just stay? - Why? What for? We're from completely different worlds. - Is that so bad? - I'm needed at home and you're needed at the castle. I'm sorry, bye. [gentle music] Dear Mrs. Ferdi, please accept this as my formal resignation. I was unable to deliver on my promise of acquiring the formula for the perfume and I will no longer be returning to Finroze. [phone ringing] - [Amber] Blair, where are you? - I'm on my way home. - Mrs. Ferdi is after your neck. - Well, you can tell her from me, she can't have it. I just quit. - Tell her yourself, she's on her way to Scotland now. - What? - She decided on direct action. - Where is she now? - I'd say right now, about a couple of hours away from the castle. - Oh my. I need a car and fast to get to Tiffly-tiffour... However you say it, as quickly as possible. So preferably with GPS. - On these roads? In this weather? - It's an emergency. - Son, where have you been? Don't you answer your phone? - I haven't missed anything. - Only my near heart attack. - Alistair, could we talk? It's about the ball. - What? [clears throat] So? What, what is it? - I made the most awful mistake breaking up with you. Well, I've regretted it ever since. - I see, really? - How could you ever forgive me? - You're forgiven. It just, it wasn't meant to be. - But it was, I know it was. - Well, you left me for that pretentious son of Lord Brockleburt and.. - And I would give anything to take it back and be with you again. Remember, when we went to that ball at the Balmoral with your parents. We danced all night. We were so happy. Everyone said what a lovely couple we made. - Yes, but that was a long time ago Kirsten. - We're from the same world. - But we're going very different places. - But can't you see I'm not like this really. I hate all this nails and shopping stuff and yachts. I'm a country girl at heart with the Highlands coursing through my veins. - Well... - Just give it a chance, it's all I'm asking. Sometimes the second time around works out better than the first because you learn from your mistakes. My mistakes, I mean. - Well, I suppose... - Oh, Alistair. - [Alistair] So the ball... - [Kirsten] Yes, I can't wait for the Christmas ball. It's going to be the best one yet. - They key to good eavesdropping is not getting caught, Lady McLeod. [classical music] [crowd mumbling] - Darling, Highland Life has just arrived and Royal Magazine. - Oh, you think of everything. - Go and dance. - Dance with me. - Tabby. - Blair, you're back. - Is Alistair in there? I have to talk to him. - His Grace is at the ball. It's already starting, dear, with Lady McLeod and her daughter. - Well, I have to go in there. - More than you know you do. But you can't go in there looking like that. Look at you. Come on. [classical music] - As you say, my dear, they make a winning couple. Shame my darling wife isn't here to see it. - And such a shame, Miss Henderson isn't here to film it. - Oh by now, she'll be at 30,000 feet. But a charming girl all the same. A real pity that she had to be a thief. - [laughs] Yes, such a pity. - It's wonderful. - Oh, I'm so happy, Alistair. On boxing day, I've booked us our very own personal shopper at Harvey Nichs. Oh, the sales are amazing. Last year I got these shoes reduced 30% to 500 pounds. - Us? There is no us, Kirsten. I said I'd think about it. [guests gasp] - What is she doing here? - I don't know, but I'm about to find out. - Oh, Duncan, I'm so sorry. - No problem, my dear. I'll find Tabby to get my spares. - You look beautiful. You missed your flight? - Oh no, I had to come here. I have to tell you something urgently. [giggling] What? What is it? - There's a Scottish saying, what's for you, will not go by you. Please allow me this dance first, you can tell me after. - Okay. [romantic music] Wait, wait, Alistair. I came here to tell you something and this is important. My boss is coming over here. - Your boss? - I'm not a filmmaker. - I know. - You know? I am a sales manager at Finroze. And I was sent to buy the Heart of the Highlands and I needed a story to stick around so I could get the formula. And I'm sorry. But when I saw how much it meant to you, you know I wasn't gonna go through with it. - I see. - You see? Are you mad? - I've been meaning to tell you something as well. - Who on earth? - [Blair] Mrs. Ferdi. - I don't believe we've met. Alistair McGregor, Earl of Glenmorie. - I did not send my employee here, at my own expense, for a holiday. - No, you sent Blair here to negotiate a deal. - Which didn't work. - Which may work. - What? - I might be willing to consider a three year license. - Oh, Alistair, no, you don't have to do that. - Wait, three years. Whoa, what are you talking about? That is not what we agreed. - No, but it is what we agreed. - And who are you? - Robert McGregor. It appears us Scots all sound the same. Mrs. Ferdi, I presume? I'm afraid our agreement is somewhat out of date. I've already sold Heart of the Highlands to a higher bidder. - You've what? - Finroze's offer was barely half what I got from Chapelle. - You sold it to that bunch of crooks. - Robert, how could you do this? - The estate is in need of a complete overhaul and now father will have the funds to do so. - Ugh, this is a waste of time. And Blair, you're fired. - Well, I already quit. Check your emails. [door slamming] - Did I miss something? - Oh, Your Grace. That wretched American returned and your dear wife's perfume was sold from under your nose. Right this minute, it's headed to the Big Apple. - Ladies and gentlemen if I may. Christmas balls are about announcements, not business negotiations. Time for us all, ladies and gentlemen, to relish these festivities, which all began with my late wife. She taught my boys and I how important it is to surround yourself with family and friends. Ladies and gentlemen, The Duchess. - [Crowd] The Duchess. - So, tonight isn't just about music and dancing and the season of merriment, it's also time for people to be together with their loved ones. My dear sons, Robert and Alistair, under one roof again. Hey, hey, and we welcome Lady McLeod and her lovely daughter, Kirsten with her great talent for... - History. - History. Yes, of course, it's history, forgive me. The history of Kirsten and Alistair. Well, it seems you can't keep two love birds apart. Another toast I think. The loveliest lady of the McLeod clan and my charming and most dutiful son, Alistair. Please enjoy a wee glass of our finest as the happy couple share a dance. - Kirsten and Alistair. [gentle music] [door closing] - Alistair, Royal Magazine want to take some photographs of us. - Oh, I'm sure they'll want to photograph this. - What do you mean? - Me packing my bags. I'm renouncing my title and with it all my responsibilities. Congratulations Robert. What was mine is from now on all yours. - But, what about us? - Oh, I doubt very much you'll want me, now I'm no longer an Earl. - No, she most certainly will not. - But... - Father, I'm sorry, but Robert selling mother's formula behind our backs was the last straw. - Alistair, wait. - Mother, do something. - The new Earl of Glenmorie. Perhaps I've had it wrong all along. - How can I have been so stupid? [camera beeps] - All the aromas come from oils which are collected from plants and flowers here in the hills, so... The first Highland perfumes were created including... - Wait, who is that? - [Robert] Jake, yes, yes. Robert, yes. Listen I've got it right here. The formula, yes. Nobody saw me. - Oh. - [Robert] Candy from a baby. - Oh. [emotional music] - Blair. - Your Grace, I need to talk to Alistair. - Unfortunately for us both, the former Earl of Glenmorie is no longer here. - The former? Where did he and Kirsten go? - Oh, he's not with Kirsten. Kirsten McLeod is now with the new Earl, Robert. I think their plans are to Christmas together in Thailand. - Your Grace, I must speak. - Look, look, my dear, it's Duncan. And please, I think I have to talk to you first. Let's sit down. I've been a complete fool. I've made a terrible mistake. Lady McLeod convinced me that you were here to steal my wife's precious perfume and that you were also after my son's fortune. But of course I see now how it was the McLeod's all along were the ones up to no good. So very disappointed in them both. I also see that Alistair is completely smitten with you. Just like I was with Candace. She would never have made such a mistake. My dear, can you ever forgive me for sticking my beak in where it wasn't needed? - No need to apologize. You're like a mute swan which mates for life and takes care of the marital home even when their partner leaves this world. Thank you. - Mute swan, eh. That's very good. I like her. Mute swan. ♪ Children are singing ♪ But this year is bringing me the blues ♪ ♪ Now I stand here alone ♪ ♪ Under our mistletoe ♪ ♪ And I need my baby home ♪ ♪ So I'm telling you ♪ - You came home for Christmas? - Christmas is for family. I realize that's exactly what I've been missing. - We've got a guest. - Oh, you're too charming [laughs]. - Alistair. What are you doing here? - [Blair's Mom] We couldn't leave him waiting outside in the car. - You left without saying goodbye for the second time. I think it's turning into a bit of a habit. I took the first flight out of Scotland to come and find you because I have to tell you something. - No, no, no, let me go first. Robert didn't license the Heart of the Highlands. He sold my perfume instead. - What? - Well, when you left me to mix my own perfume, I left the camera running by mistake. And I left my perfume formula on the side. I made it for you mom. Merry Christmas. - Ahhh, it's beautiful. - This is the perfume formula he stole. When I went back to the cabin, it had gone. The film shows your brother taking it, assuming it was your mother's. So I spoke to Chapelle and they love my recipe. So, the Heart of the Highlands is safe. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. [clears throat] Oh, maybe we should go outside? - Yeah, good idea. - For a walk. [laughs] So you knew all along? - You did seem more comfortable making perfumes than films. - Yeah, so why didn't you say anything? - Because I didn't want you to leave. Because I was falling in love with you. But now it's too late. Now I am completely and utterly in love with you. - But Kirsten? - There's nothing between us. There never was. We would never work together but you, Blair, you're the one I want to be with. And I'll come here if I have to or you can come back with me and make perfumes in the castle. That is if you think you could love me as well.
