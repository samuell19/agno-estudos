THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER If it's my fault you feel bad, you should leave me. You know you're sinking. You're aware of it. It's getting worse. You were already incapable of behaving responsibly, except in your work. Now... How about we go away? Take off for a few days in the sun? You're in a bad way. You don't speak. Not even to criticize me. Maybe there's nothing to criticize. It isn't at our age that we attain happiness, but we can at least manage to be calmer, to accept things. You accept nothing. I'm not asking you to be happy, to be happy with me, you see? I'm asking nothing. But you can't continue to be this way. Be a bit selfish. Be kind to yourself. Why do you hurt yourself so? Goodnight. Goodnight. It's nice, very nice. I'm a big girl The evil demons are out. They're dancing in my head. Accept the idea I am stupid, disorientated, exhausted by my inadequacy. Something has come to a standstill. It does not want to occur. Good. Great. Pretend I'm not here. Great! Good! Look up a bit. Great! I knew it would be great. I wasn't worried. Great! I'm not sure I can face myself. But how'll I find something of this someone so unused to looking for me? What happens is meant to be. I want to live! I want to live. What's going on? Isn't Anne with you? It's alright. She's in a bad way, and I don't know what to do. She's in her new flat. Did you hear about it? She never goes out. She hasn't even been to work. - Did you have a fight? - No. Since we moved in 3 months ago, I've had no time to garden. My husband is delighted. He loves this shambles. It isn't ugly either. I think he felt suffocated by all my flowers. Maybe that's why we sold up and bought this place. He's sleeping, or pretending to. She and he are so alike. All I had were my flowers. When I couldn't sleep, I'd walk around and look at my bouquets. Sometimes it calmed me down. What have you done to her? What have they done to my baby? Hello, Jean-Marie. Your daughter needs us. She's in a very bad way. I received this letter from her. I feel bad about showing it to you. You must understand she needs help. Our help. If I intervene, she'll take it badly. She doesn't hate me, but she'll take it badly. It's hard to say, but... It isn't me she needs at the moment. I got it yesterday. I'll go get her. I'll serve a purpose. - She isn't a child anymore. - If you say so. I'll call on you, but send a doctor round. Children leave... No one gets over it. I'll give her a call. - No. We'll go fetch her. - I think that'd be better. I have to go. Could you call me at home at 5pm? Of course. Don't worry. Sorry! I'm kissing everyone today. You have to eat something. We'll weigh you. You won't leave this house until you've turned into a fat mother with a big belly, like when you were a baby. Shall we do the garage? When you were tiny, we weighed you one day. We told you your weight, and you lay face down on the scales. We asked you why, and you replied, "I weighed my feet. I'll weigh my tummy." - Remember? - I've heard it 50 times. But not in a long while. We'll do the garage, but make an effort. Do a plane. A cake-plane. - What now? - A bike. Open the door. What now? I don't know. Horses that are annoyed and want to go back to the stables. Come on, open the door. It isn't a stable, it's a garage. What's this? An ambulance. No, the doctor. He's the best. - Our doctor is charming. - My doctor. A last spoonful. Raise your arm! Higher! A house that laughs after the doctor's visit. One day when you were tiny... This is a story you've never heard. Your father and I were in bed, you came in from your room and said to your father you wanted to "forquate" with him. "Forquate"? We didn't understand your made-up word. You climbed onto your father's belly. You were tiny. And you started moving your little bottom. Then we understood what forquate meant. You must have created it from "flirt" and "fornicate". Fornicate sounds so scholarly. I hate all those words. But it was beautiful to watch. A little embarrassing too. Don't touch me! I can't bear to be touched. He loves another woman? He wants to forquate or is he in love? It's different. He's in love. Let's not talk about it. I don't want to discuss it. It hurts me. You don't think it hurts me more? He's a big baby, your father. A big baby. He'll take care of you, but take care of him too. - You have to be generous. - I'm ever so nice! I console him when he comes home sad. I don't shout at him. I try to make him feel better. You also know that you'll keep him. I wish he'd make love to her. Things would be better. Maybe. I'm becoming such a wretch! At least he is lying to himself. Goodnight. I sleep well though. I'm a selfish sleeper. Goodnight to you too. Either your house is leaning or the sea isn't straight! I believe it's the house. Sure it won't collapse on us? That's why I bought it. Because of the attractive idea it might fall on me. Living in fear of a heart attack, a stroke, cancer, and boom, you die from a house falling on your head. Death by a house. Lovely, isn't it? It helps to go down the garden. You just have to let yourself slide. Has Mum gone? Yes. I took her to the station earlier. - Were you working? - Yes. I'm trying to finish a masterpiece before I die. Something for posterity. Do you see? Feeling better? I'll fix your breakfast. OK, but I'll go get dressed. Will you have it outside? If you like. You have to take your pills. If I wasn't here, what would you do this morning? Nothing special. I'd go for a walk. Go to the tennis courts. - You play tennis? - No. I watch. You're going to the courts then. I'm here to look after you. You're going to go, otherwise I'll make you! Come on, get up! No. I'm taking care of you. You might have written or come to see me. It isn't nice of you. I hit you hard with it. It didn't break though. Does it hurt? - Hey, does it hurt? - Not enough, I imagine. I'm sorry. You didn't manage to break a plate and my skull. Don't apologize. How will I be if you don't go to tennis? I'll just go there and come back, alright? Fine. And your life? Is it good? I swallow one spoonful an hour, as Chekhov would say. I let myself be dragged along. What's your fiancée called? The lady you love. Is your asthma troubling you less? That fool of a doctor... waited till the sea was lethal. I've never had so few attacks. You don't think it's the lady? Hey! Come here. All of a sudden, I don't understand. I love her. It's terrible. I never thought it could happen to me. A huge rather dignified carcass suddenly disguised as... a bloody wreck. The wreck looks pretty good. Go to tennis. I'll call if I need you. You'll see, you'll hear a phone ringing in your head. I feel better. I'm strong. See how strong I am! Let yourself go. Show me how handsome you are. Go on, walk a bit. Walk. Yes. You're rather pretty today. See you later. You have to follow the ball. On spectators' faces, it's like this. Have a go. Try. You'll soon get a taste for it. Could you hold them? Yes, but I'll keep them. They're a gift. - Certainly not. - Certainly. Acute conjunctivitis. An emergency. Failure to assist a person in danger. I'm in danger with you. Twiddly dee! Yes, twiddly dee. Alright? I drove here so as not to tire myself. I'm leaving soon but take your time. I wanted to know if you were in love or seduced. And? Seduced. I'm the daughter of that gentleman. I'm pleased to meet you. Me too. Are you better? Yes. Are you free tonight for dinner? My mother is away. But there'll be friends of my father. Did your father send you? You think badly of my father. Look at him. Look at him. You can see he is incapable of that. Do you agree with me? Yes. When I was small, I think he loved me very much, this gentleman who's worried about what we're saying, who is pretending to be interested in the match. I was the only person he managed to beat violently. You wouldn't think it. But I knew how to defend myself too. Are you free tonight? It isn't a trap. I'll be there, I'll make sure you're safe. But come alone. But you're alone, I think. She was a dancer. And married to a man who died 3 years ago. He was quite wealthy. She gives dance classes but she isn't needy. I've always loved dancers. It's all I love. I find all the rest horrible. It's a nice start to a letter, huh? Which isn't from me. Don't you want to write her a love letter with me? Sorry. I'll go. I'm going home to lie down to get my blood pressure back up. No guilty phone calls to invite a couple of pains tonight, OK? Just the three of us. Your fiancée, the old man and me. Don't say my "fiancée", even as a joke. I'll say it as much as I like, old man. Good evening. We didn't manage to invite anyone else. They're all playing bridge or busy watching TV. You're the only friend of the family. Will you accept our loneliness? I never run away. It's my Prussian side. I'm in the kitchen. My daughter will take care of you. The menu is very good. The wines are excellent. My father is spoiling us. You won't regret it. How can I make you comfortable? But I am comfortable. I'll get it. It's our mother. My mother who wants news. How did you guess? Don't worry. Will you call tomorrow? Is my sister well? I'm fine. Yes, believe me. I'm eating and sleeping. I'd better go before it gets cold. Take care. Talk to you tomorrow. My father will call back after you leave. To take a bag and leave, for my father, that's beyond him. I'm not saying that to cast doubt on his feelings, but to reassure you. What's the meaning of this evening? If we were doing forbidden things, there'd be uneasiness, but there is simply this carefully prepared dinner and these blinis that deserve to be eaten warm. Another answer. If you have the feeling I didn't answer you properly, you're the doll and he's the big bad wolf. When I was tiny, I'd asked for a wolf for Christmas. "Kind Father Christmas, "I'm sending you a letter and a kiss. "And I want a wolf to scare me." Does he scare you? I hope so. Or the evening is ruined. Let's have our salmon before you find other answers. I've already written to this lady suggesting we live together. Because you knew you would not be understood. That it was impossible. Please. Forgive me, both of you, if you ever go off together. I know you that badly? Forgive me. That's enough. Stop apologizing. I'm not a doll. And if I have something to say to the big bad wolf, I'll tell him in private. After the blinis, a Viennese speciality. A chocolate cake called Sacher. You must know it. We'll have the cake and coffee in the sitting room. Don't go, or I'll strangle you. I'm a sick child. It's my evening. You have to obey me. I thought it was my and your father's evening. Yes. It's our evening. We mustn't part so soon. If my mother went, it was to look after my sister but also to give my father the freedom to see you. And to decide his fate. It's hard for her. But it's good. Even though she didn't know you were here. Earlier, on the phone, she was in a huff. But we have to put my father first. He's more sensitive than my mother. Take your time. I'm being indiscreet about you. I'll hurry then. Certainly not. He's in love with a pious image... come down from the wall where he's hung you. I don't know what he'd think of you. It's disturbing, an old young man in love. Especially this one. He's so ill at ease with reality. Don't feed this exaltation. Come down from the wall so you can be seen. But don't give him reason to dream. Come back. I've had my say. May I take a photo of the two of you? I'd like you side by side on the couch. It's my turn to snap you. Let's do another one. I moved. I'm tired, but I feel fine. Sleep here tonight. No one's waiting for you. I don't want to stay. Your daughter wants to rush things. You must take good care of her. I really like your love. But don't expect much from me. Promise to not try to see me for a while. Alright, if that's what you want. I'll miss you. You're such a sweet person. I'm going to talk to your daughter. To say goodbye to her. Don't be afraid. May I come in? Just a minute. Come in. I won't make love with your father. That's what you wanted tonight, isn't it? Yes. It's what you feared at the same time. May I not thank you for this evening? It's pretty and dead as a rehearsed line, but you may. This evening was more to hurt your mother. My mother said about my father, "It's beautiful to be in love at his age." It sounded generous, but it was above all ironic. I don't like that about her. She makes fun of his feelings. I won't take him from you. I know that now. You're not a witch. Everyone knows mothers are witches. It is they who steal our fathers. Call me if you're bored tomorrow. Don't feel you have to. I asked your father not to... to take care of you. To not see you anymore? If you prefer. You're beautiful. You have a lovely body. Maybe I'll come for a gym class. Forgive the slip. A dance class. For me, it's the same thing. That's a lie. I always dreamt of being a dancer, like all little girls. With my bow legs, it isn't pretty. You can't be a dancer with legs like that. Goodnight. Goodnight, the Fiancée. That's what I call you. Call me the Dancer instead. It's more amusing. And more accurate. Goodnight. I can't sleep. I can't sleep. Now I'm going to sleep. I've made breakfast. Will you come have it or shall I bring to you? As you like. I'll bring it to you. I had good intentions, and I messed things up. In tragedies, often, the main characters have a confidant. You can't content yourself with playing that role. Are they as clumsy as me? They're often lost. Put your shoes on. You'll catch a cold. Did I stop you sleeping? Did I move too much? No. You didn't breathe down my nose. Your mother could only fall asleep on my side. She didn't look at me for long, she fell asleep at once. Want to know a secret? She could only fall asleep with one leg, her left, on mine. And then you'd cough and she'd go back to her room. And there she is. Your lady wife. It was your husband. He's coming. Why call then? Why didn't you give him to me? Because he's coming. I don't want to see him. I won't see him. That's silly. He's coming to see you. I don't want to see him. Otherwise, I'd have called him. Maybe he needs to see you. I need peace and quiet. Explain to him. When I can, I'll see him. I don't want to see him at the moment. You already said that. Just calm down! OK? Tell him. Will you tell him? I trust you. I can't see him. - Alright? - Yes, and you all? My wife is with her other daughter. Each of us has a dependent child. Ours has just had a kind of mini nervous breakdown. She's gone to rest. Is it serious? She's better, but wants to be left alone. She doesn't want to see you. She's eating well and sleeping properly. Don't worry. I won't stay, but I'll go see her. I don't understand, but she won't see you. But I want to see her. I won't stay. Men who don't help me recover, I'm through with them. I wish you wanted to see me. And you were calmer. Calm? Be calmer? What a programme! It's all so petty. I'm after something bigger. But I have no choice. The smallest, the calmest, it makes me sick. I'll leave. Yes. - Did you hear? - No. Why treat me like that? I don't understand what's happening. She's very tired. She was on the verge of breakdown. I won't call again. Your husband comes and you can't see him? I played the messenger... And I accepted! Don't you know anything human relationships? Why are you intent on isolating yourself from everyone? And isolating me? Get out of this house. Go! Get out! Anne! You beat me. Did I hurt you? No. Yachts annoy me but I like freighters because they make me feel I'm on an island. I feel guilty. I feel bad... about agreeing to act as an idiotic barrier against him. I feel bad too... for this stupid anger. I feel bad above all about trying to hit you. You should've protected me. Because it's pointless. I don't want to need him anymore. Don't look at me. Don't you trust me anymore? We have to talk, Jean-Marie and I. I should call, or go to see him. But not now. He has to understand. I would like to feel here how I used to feel. In our house in London. In Jenny Row. Being a grown-up is hard. He's intelligent, Jean-Marie. He'll understand. I'll call Jean-Marie later. But you have to call that woman. Do it, please. If you want me to still trust you. You're right. I'm cutting you off from everyone. I was angry. Angry? That's good. It explains things. But it's upsetting. My legs are like jelly. I'm going to lie down. And thank you for the blows. You hit me properly. I didn't hit you, I... Will you give me a sleeping pill? Yes. Half a pill. - Will it be enough? - Yes, it should be. Hello. My daughter made me call you. She's sleeping right now. She made me. So I'm calling. Don't be angry. You're not angry? I'll hang up. I'll call you later. Call me whenever you like, if you want to... I... I called for no reason, but I heard your voice. Hang up. I'm incapable. - Did you sleep well? - Yes. I had a dream that woke me up. Or rather a nightmare. It was a nice dream but a terrible nightmare. We ought to say "terrimare". You and I went to my new flat. I found a pool had been installed on the ground floor. Everything was transparent. Through the windows, we could see people swimming. I remember even seeing the naked breasts of a girl rising out of the water. I had... Yes, I had to... I had to carry things for my flat. I don't remember what. Only that I was laden down. I asked you to carry my black bag. We looked for it in vain. And I apologized because my bag was actually blue. The stairs had changed too. It was like an escalator. After the black bag episode that really upset me, I was happy about the change. I started going up to my flat on the escalator. I don't remember if I reached my flat. I must've woken up on the way up, or I've forgotten. Shall we go shopping? - Isn't there anything to eat? - No. It's always the early images that come back. Or rather characters. You, the father, my mother, my sister too. As if our later experiences, the bulk of our life, did not count at all. You're tired. You're always annoyed. Try to be calm. You're barely awake. Stay in my shell, as usual. Doctors know how to check your blood pressure. As for real tension, they're absolutely clueless. If I shout, it's because I must to feel better. And I don't even shout. Jean-Marie is the important person. That's why I didn't want to see him. When I'm not well, I'm taken back to him. When I'm fine, he stops me feeling good. I can't talk to you about him. I'd like to talk about him, to take the time. But I can't do it. I made myself English to flee you, it seems. As if I didn't want you to exist. I didn't want to be your bastard. I would have liked just to be your daughter. But I came back to France. I made myself English to be like my mother, then? To marry a Frenchman, like her. A Frenchman like you. Maybe I was jealous of my sister too. When I was small, I didn't understand. You preferred me. Yes. I believe that now. You preferred me. You were more attracted to me. I get the feeling you felt bad about preferring me. I loved you both. I'm talking about a greater attraction. You're not contradicting me. Dare say the contrary. No. I don't agree. And I'm saying you did! You did! It's practically all I know about you. You did! When I was small, I didn't understand. I thought you preferred her. You're so handsome when you sleep. Soft and long and dislocated, like a sleeping beauty. Your hands keep out the light. I hear your breathing, regular and tired. I'd like to watch you longer, but I only have a moment. I wasn't expecting to steal your image without your knowledge. Thank you. Yes? Your wife's complaining that she wasn't called. That you didn't call her. Go to sleep. I'm not tired. Was she very annoyed? I'll call tomorrow. Will you remind me? You can remind yourself. I'm going to bed. I'm going to read. If your insomnia is tough, meet me at 2am. - Alright. - Alright? I want to show you my flat. I can't sleep here. I want to show you my flat now. I'd like you to like it. You've never seen it. And we'll see the pool. There'll be naked girls with beautiful breasts. And the escalator. I'd like to know if the escalator goes to my flat. Come on. If you're tired, you can sleep at my flat. Come see the pool. Come on. Get dressed. I'm happy to show you my home. Everything depends on you. You are my goal. My start today. I don't know why but I'm sure of it. Why do you think I came back? Tell me. I don't understand. Why don't you want to understand? Why? Why? Do you like it? It's nice, really nice. Come here, you. When was the last time you held me like this, in your arms? The breasts that sprout when you are 12, they're to repel the father. But mine didn't sprout. I wanted to hold onto you, not repel you with my breasts. But you left anyway. I'll put the light on. I dreamt so vividly of you. I met you on some stairs as you were going down slowly. You were very weak, like after an asthma attack, and you definitely needed me. I took you in my arms and took you back to bed. And I had never felt such fulfilment before. It was such a sensual dream. It had nothing to do with sex. Well, beyond sex anyway. And I've never dreamt so vividly. With so much love. Never like that. In the end, it is I who came to you. And ill. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Has your daughter fallen so low? I'm hurting, and you can't do anything! I'm hurting, I'm hurting so much! No, don't you leave! This is ridiculous. You think so? I'm like tonight, rather long and ugly and so wanton. They're nice. They're pyjamas I bought for myself. You sleep in the bedroom, I'll sleep here, on the couch. But don't go. Let's go home. When you slept in my bed, you were a little girl. I was afraid too when I came into your bed. Keep them. They're a gift. Thank you. Your hand. Strong. You try to make a god of me only to triumph over me. You can't beat me anymore, which is absurd. I know I'm giving you the best of myself. I know it. I don't need it. I'm the boss. God then simply the boss. You've been demoted. Alright then. I'll stay till you fall asleep. I thought in my head I was the prettiest girl ever. Maybe it isn't so, but I thought it. You too, try to sleep. I'm going to sleep now. But I'll never regret wanting to kiss you. Or the panic of wanting everything. Yes? You're awake? May I come in? Yes. You look lovely. They're nice, huh? - Sleep well. - You too. We can't rekindle what we have never known. You always talk about old feelings. Why not talk about now? Your husband, this breakdown between you, the child you don't have... It isn't that. Life is so far away. I can't see it anymore. You have to provoke it, invoke it. It is here though. I invoked it, and it isn't life that appeared but someone else. Maybe you were life. I'm incapable of living it. All I can do is dream. I'm not a character from a tragedy. Just a poor pathetic goat... that maybe tied itself up and wants to be freed. But I don't have the strength. You have the strength to hurt yourself. Ah yes. Maybe I have that strength. I was waiting for you to tell you I was leaving. I'm taking the car. I arranged it with Mum. She'll drive it back from Paris. He's born. - Is it Vincent then? - Yes, it's Vincent. 3.5 kg. Don't speak of him like meat. I spoke to your mother. We'll go in the morning, alright? May I stay another night? Yes, but make yourself up. And prettily. I want pink cheeks. I don't want to see her white and pale, the pretty girl I love. My makeup is in the car. Can you go get it? Is it possible? Yes. I'll make dinner. We'll celebrate the birth. - Champagne then? - Champagne. You've been passive from the start because I'm ill. Illness can be used to make others feel guilty. It's ever so handy. But don't be passive anymore. Come on. It's a game. Tell me everything you haven't said. And forcefully. Why tell you things that I don't think? That's a bad and very cowardly start. Right. Let me think. You got rid of your mother. End of Act One. You're on the right track. But it isn't quite true. She lured me here to keep an eye on you, to stop you loving the other lady. Then you got rid of the other lady. End of Act Two. Maybe. And then of your husband. That must be Act Three. We'll say it's Act Three. And now you don't know how to get rid of me. How you're going to devour me. I'll devour you, for sure. Do you think you'll manage to sort out the mess in your head? All I have to do is drink some champagne. It's funny. I was thinking of when you met Jean-Marie, when I had to tell you there was another man. It wasn't easy. And you weren't pleased. Then you met him. He used his charm on you and you were less jealous, apparently. In fact, you're still just as jealous. You piss us all off with your dancer business so we come back to you, and so I come back to you. If you thought about it instead of just shrugging, you'd know it's true. Of course it isn't true. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Believe me, it's true! Slap me. Go! - Stop it! - Come on! Yes, yes, yes! - Stop it. - Fight me! You're going to hurt me... because I'm your little girl... and no one has ever made love to me. I have backache. If I'd found some bleach, I'd have used it to wash myself. What happened... won't happen again. You're not to blame for it. You miss the first step, and then... you just slide, fall flat on your face. Now you'll be an even stronger part of my life. It's beautiful here. Being with you. I'm asking you not to feel ashamed. Even if I'll fret about it tonight. And you too, for sure. Don't regret anything, even this savagery. We couldn't find anything else. We must overcome the shame and remember tonight as a beautiful and great night. And flatten this dirty feeling of shame even if it floors us first. We must pick ourselves up. Promise me? It's what I wanted. The sister descends, she has a child. And I go up. I found the man from whom I came. I didn't want to continue the chain. I might be able to now. If I don't feel good, I'll come sleep with you. But I don't think I'll be able to. And you too. Call me if you're in a bad way. Goodnight. If I'd wanted all this... in all conscience, I'd have wanted it to be a delight. But it isn't a delight. No. Delight would be an illusion. A lie. We can't leave the house in this state! Sorry. - It's dirty! - Sorry. I can't take anymore! I don't want you to forgive me. I just want you to pity me. Yes... To pity my poor courage. Visiting hours are over. It's you? This is life. Are you better? Yes. My stomach hurts. I'm the one who gave birth. Me too. It's a secret. - To problems? - No. Not to problems. - Do you want to hold him? - No. - I'll drop him. - No. Hold him. Don't you think my breasts are bit bigger? Do you think you're pregnant? Do you think you're pregnant? Don't you? It'd be good. It'd be great. That's it. I'm pregnant. It's funny. I have no more regrets. No more regrets. It's good. About what? The problems.
