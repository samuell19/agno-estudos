(cool music) (dramatic music) - [Reporter] Well, it's gonna be another hot one out there folks with a high of 92 degrees. Wow, get your sunscreen on. (cars honking) (dramatic music) - [Reporter] Day in doctors at St. John's Medical Center just informed me that there's been a rapid decline in pneumonia and respiratory infections this season. (dramatic music) - [Reporter] After the initial vaccine campaign that ended last month, people are reporting a return of flu like symptoms. (dramatic music) (people shouting) (dramatic music) - [Reporter] The center for disease control and prevention is baffled at how in just three days, this new strain has spread so quickly. - It's too early to tell. We don't know if the C100 virus is to blame or if it's something new. (dramatic music) - [Reporter] Broadcast will quiet at this time for your safety. Continue to carry out the following instructions. (people shouting) (dramatic music) Due to the flood of people reporting to emergency rooms across the country. The military was forced to set up field hospitals but still the question remains as to whether the... Wait, come on. Dr. Campbell, wait. Wait, Dr. Campbell, wait. - Please not now. - Back off. - No, as one of the top infectious disease specialists in the country, we need some answer. Please, is the virus airborne? - Unfortunately, I don't have any answers for you right now, except that the CDC and every other branch of the World Health Organization has this as their top priority. And I can assure you with a hundred percent certainty that we are very close to figuring out what our nation is facing, but we're not there yet. Therefore, it's essential that we treat this like any other pandemic. We need to stay calm, do not go outside unless it's emergency. - Are you kidding me, wait. Stay calm? That's all you have to offer our viewers? - Jesse, if you hear this, please just get somewhere safe until we get this figured out, all right? No, no, please, you need to listen to me, just do not go outside. (mumbling) You need to believe your mom. I promise you, it's all gonna be all right. I'm here for you, always. - Doctor please, one more question. - No. - Is the virus airborne? Please. - I have nothing else to say. - [Amy] Our lives are at stake. Please. (spooky music) (dramatic music) (crying) (screeching) (rock music) (laughing) - That's it for me. I'm crashing. - What? No, you're not going to bed right now. - Come to the woods you said "Stay off the grid having a great time." I'm seriously jonesing for my phone right now. - We are having a great time, aren't we? - Oh yeah. - [] Save a spot for me.

(crying) Urgh! - Ouch, ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch! - Okay, okay, keep the pressure on. - Yes. - You're gonna be okay. - Oh, something clearly just didn't get bit by some rabid nutcase. - You'll be okay, I promise. (somber music) - Why, am I dying? - No, no. Hell know. You're not dying, you're gonna be okay. - Because, if I was dying, I would te ll you this, I slept with your boyfriend. (laughing) - You're hilarious. - I am serious. - You need to save your energy. - And It was in your bed . (laughing) - Stop it, I know you're joking. - I am sorry.

(growling) (spooky music) (door banging) Okay. (breathing heavily) (beeping) - [Voicemail] You have three new messages. - [Woman] John, pick up, where are you? I've been here all night. They won't let me leave. They're saying something about quarantine. Call me as soon as you get this. I love you. (beeping) - [Voicemail] Next message. - [Woman] John, if you're there pick up. Okay, I have to work late. Most of the second shift never showed up and we have dozens of patients waiting to be admitted, this is unbelievable. Something's going around I guess. Sorry honey, I'll be home as soon as possible. I love you. Give Rachael a kiss for me. (beeping) - [Voice Mail] Next message. - [Woman] Something's really wrong. Get Rachael away from there, take her to my mom's and I'll go meet you. (beeping) - [Voicemail] You have no new messages. (spooky music) Hello? (spooky music) (screaming) (growling) (screaming) (door squeaking) (spooky music) - I've been in the there all night, he wouldn't leave. - Who are you? - I'm Emma. That was my brother-in-law. I've been searching for my sister and my niece. This is their house. Who are you - Jesse. - It's just like I know everybody in town and you're- - I'm going home. I need a car. - Are they sending help? - Who? - They? The government? I don't know, FEMA, the national guard? They always send the national guard. - I don't know. You're the first person I've seen since. - So it's everywhere? outside town. - Everywhere I've been. - Jesus! Come with me. We'll go back to the diner. There's a group of us there waiting out this new flu thing. Strength in numbers, you know? You're gonna need a shower, you're covered in blood. (dramatic music) (water trickling) (gasping) - Hey, hurry up- - Yeah. - Are you all right? - I was just washing my face. - Show me the wound. - What? - How did you get that? - I was in an accident. - Bullshit, they're teeth marks. When'd you get it? - Yesterday. - But don't lie to me. - I swear to God. - Then why haven't you turned? - I don't know. - Show me your gums. It starts with a fever, then your gums bleed. Let me see. Your eyes (indistinct) there's either. So why aren't you sick like them? - I don't know. My mom always said I had champion genes. - Did you get the shot? - No. - I didn't neither. Neither did anybody get the diner. But you've been bitten, so why aren't you sick? - I don't know. My mom she's a scientist and when I was little, she was always giving me shots. Maybe that had something to do with it. I really don't know. - Okay well, if you're bitten and you're not sick then someone needs to know about this. I may be able to get you to your mom. There's a car up behind the diner it belongs to the owners cook, but he's one of them now so he won't be using it. I'll take you with me on one condition. You don't tell everybody that you've been bitten. They'll flip their shit if they know. - Okay. (spooky music) (growling) (jiggling) Large Coffee three sugar - What? - I know her. She comes to the diner every Monday morning like clockwork. (spooky music) When those things began attacking out at the diner trying wait out the worst of it? By the next morning only few people left in town - How long was that? - A week, three days at most. - A week? - Didn't take long. There's a back entry to the alley (spooky music) (growling) Ready, go. (spooky music) (mumbling) (growling) (spooky music) (growling) (spooky music) - What do want to do? Beat them to death with alcohol? - When I say go, we gonna make a dash to the door, got it? (spooky music) (bottle creaking) (growling) Two bets, two bets. - Come on Come on. (gun corking) - Who the fuck are you? - Easy Roy, she saved my life. She's cool. - Cool? Miss Thang, almost let those monsters inside here. That is most definitely not cool. Emma, new rule. No one enters our exits unless Roy says so, kapeesh? - Try to ignore him. - It's easy for you to say. - Ignore him? My place, my party. You don't like it, find another carnival. - I don't plan on staying long. - Search her for weapons. I want everyone in the main room, now. - Everybody, Jesse, Jesse, everybody. - Great, another mouth to feed. She seems okay Roy Remember that bitch who sunk her teeth into our dog. Or did you forget about that already, honey pie? You show one side of the sickness and I will end your day. You hear? - Don't be so overdramatic, honey. - She's fine, Roy... - Shut your cake hole, Emma, this is Roy's Island. Roy makes the rules. And the only rule is do whatever the hell I say. - Chill Mr. Temer, you're scaring Grace. - But she's made it this far, that's say something. - Roy didn't have to let a single one of you free loaders stay here, remember that. - Is he referring himself in the third person? - Yeah, he does that a lot? - Man, one more time ain't gonna hurt. - It's gonna hurt when you run out of Roy's food and H2O. - I'll give her some of my Saltines. - A sucker going every Goddamn minute. I'm gonna go and re-check the stockroom. If I find one can out of place, I'm throwin' the two of you to the wolves. - Don't mind him. This whole thing's has got him testier than usual. - Hope he didn't scare you. I'm Martha. This is my husband, Fred. - Everybody calls me Red. - Hey - Jesse doesn't scare easily. Oh well, you lived this long, you've seen just about everything. But the one's out there now. Well, that's a new on me and red. - You, made this far without a fella out there? - Yeah. - Impress-eev-oh. - He doesn't mean any disrespect. He's old-fashioned, set in his ways. - It's okay. I can see you got yourself so help too. So, you guys just been cooped up in here, just waiting? - What do you want us to do? I mean, at least nobody is looking for us in this shithole. - Fred and I are too old to go anywhere anyway. - Jesse and I are gonna get some help. - It's too dangerous to go anywhere. - I gotta get home. - You got somebody waiting for you? - Hope so, mom. - Yeah, good luck going in alone. I mean you go out there, get ourselves killed. Hey, I'd rather starve to death in here, than get my juggler chomed out there. Sorry, kid. Mea Culpa? - What do you say, Grace? - Thank you. - We good? - So you must be Mark's sister? Your brother's really brave. - He always takes care of me. - My mom's the same. Does anyone know the quickest way to get to Atlanta from here? - Take the highway West, 190 miles or so get you in the vicinity. - So where are your parents? We don't know? - I found them in a State park a few days ago. - We were resting. We're not from around here. My uncle is some survivalist nut job, at least. I thought he was a nut job until all this started happening. Last time I saw him, I was around eight or nine. Grace has never met him. He has a farm just outside of Rose city. We were headed there when we got held up here. - All right Miss Thang. Let me lay down the rules for ya. One, I decide when you're thirsty. Two, I decide when you're hungry, kapeesh? Oh, you don't wanna make friends. It's a cold hard world out there, pays to make friends. See old Red here, didn't think I noticed he swiped that extra bottle of water last night. Did you Red? You can't even piss it out old man. So why bother? - You're evil. - You know, you talk too much. - And your mouth just as big as your belly, full of shit. - I've been more than fair. - Roy's just looking out for everyone, he's protecting us. - See, sweet piece of pussy shows up, suddenly we got a mutiny? Y'all had best settle down if you wanna keep enjoying Roy's hospitality. Rather die than take anything from him again - Are we on? Are we live? Okay, good. Listen, I don't know how much longer we're gonna be able to broadcast. This may be our last report. We have just received word that the sickness that has spread is a direct result of the C100 flu vaccine. This is apparently some sort of mutation of a dead virus that has been used to inoculate millions of people with horrific results. The gestation period from post inoculation to when symptoms present is anywhere from one week to less than 24 hours. If you received the vaccine, you have the virus. This bears repeating. If you got a flu shot, you are infected. - What Bear's repeating is this, the government is always fucking things up. They keep trying to do the same thing, but in different ways. Hey, don't mess with what ain't yours. (somber music) Attack your shit for brain. - Man, the only thing I want attacking my brain is this. You ask me, I've seen it coming, man. I mean, tsunamis, earthquakes all over the world, famine, drought. - Surprise it didn't happen sooner. (spooky music) - I never thought I'd see the end of the world. - Wasn't world has been falling apart. We've been falling apart. From the inside. - don't talk that way. I'm sure the president is doing something, - Unless virus got him too. (somber music) - What are you looking at? Insulin. - [Lucy] Roy's got the diabetes. - Shut up Lucy. * Bake me, cake as fast as you can * * Pat it, prick it, mark it with a B * * Put it in the oven for a baby and me * - You know what that means? - No. - The Pat it and prick it. Mark it with a B? So in the olden days, the Baker would bake all of the bread for all people in the town. And he would mark the top of the bread with the toothpick with the first letter of the last name of the family. So they knew it was there so when they came to pick it up. The bakery was like a communal oven. - What's a communal? - A communal means, well, it's kinda like what we're doing here in the diner. Like we're all living together, taking care of each other the best we can, right? - Mm-hm. - You okay? - Yes. Makes me miss my mom. - Yeah? Tell me about her. - She's smart and successful. She has a career working for a pharmaceutical company. She's pretty much the opposite of me. - Now you sell yourself short. - Maybe she has some kind of idea of what's going on? - I don't know. Just wanna get back to her. I need the keys to the car. - I think Roy has them. (lights buzzing) - What happened? - What was that? - Nothing, don't worry about it. - We gotta go back and check the generator. Those things must've bumped into it again. - In the morning honey, do it then. - We gotta to keep this place cool for the meat in the back and for my insulin. - Time for TV? If the news comes back on. - Anyone steals from me while I'm gone, and I swear to God, that includes you denture Dick. Come on kid, you gotta watch my ass. You too Brandon. - I'll go. - What? - I said, I'll go. Stay with your sister. - All right, kid, you go babysit. Miss Thang is going daddy bear. - She'll be back. Don't worry. (door squeaking) (spooky music) - Shit! (spooky music) - Where are they? - I don't know, maybe the smell of Roy's scared them off. - Shut up, come on. (spooky music) The one time they took out the trash. You know Miss Thang, I like your spunk. I don't even know why I bothered with everyone else. It's like they think I owe them something. As far as I'm concerned, Emma doesn't even work for me anymore. And I don't believe that the customer is always right applies neither. Is not in a situation like this and that old fuck, he can roll over dead too as far as I'm concerned. (generator rolling) - Come on man. Hey, can you just hurry up and fix that thing so we get back inside, even know what your man? - I installed this generator myself, you whiny ass bitch. - Yeah, whatever. - I appreciate you taking me in Roy. (laughing) - See, that's all I ask for, a little bit of respect and maybe a wee bit of thanks. - Oh shit! (growling) (screaming) (dramatic music) (gun shot firing) - No contact with the customers bitch. - Roy! - Lucy! - I hope he's dead. - Dammit Fred! (screaming) (mumbling) - [Woman] Cry! (spooky music) - Take us with you. - What? No, I can't. - My uncle's place is just along the way of wherever you're going. - Roy wasn't right about a lot of things, but he was right about us sticking together. - And stick together here. You're safer here than on the road. - Hey, I wanna go too. I mean, if this thing that hasn't gotten a hold on you yet, maybe you're just a thing to stop it. (cool music) - Roy was lucky to have you. - Yo, we buggin', if you know you wanna join us. - Take some supplies too, we won't need them. - There's not much room, but if you want to come with us. - It don't seem worth it without Roy. You go on, save the world. There's a world left to save. Go, while you can. (whispering) - We're gonna see it through right here with Lucy here. Martha woke up feeling sick. Jerky didn't sit well. - Thank you, Red. Martha, you'll feel better, okay? (gasping) - You know how to use one of these? - I may have learned on flintlock, but I'll manage. - [Emma] All right, come on guys. (spooky music) - How many bullets. (spooky music) - Won't you know it, two. (car engine roaring) (spooky music) (gunshot) (spooky music) - Atlanta song's fine to me. Maybe catch some grits and greens and stuff. You? - Nope, everyone I knew is dead or infected, so. - Everybody keeps saying infected. I mean, that's just how it starts. I mean, you get bit, you die and you bite, period. Unless you're Jesse, the wonder girl. Other than that, you gotta bash some brains man. Ain't that right Marky Mark? You my man, are a bonafide Thumper. Man, hey, I saw what you did to them Zombies to get into to that diner. (laughing) - If you die after you get bit, your soul is taken, right? The body is just a shell. - No, your body becomes a virus spreading machine. Your soul has nothing to do with it. What kind of God who creates souls will let something terrible like this happen anyway? Maybe we pissed him off I don't believe in God. I believe in scientists. Scientists that go messing when they ain't got no business messing. - If you have God, you have everything. Without God, we have nothing. - Yeah, well what do we got now Mark? Everything's gone bro. - I have everything. - So you don't have anywhere to be? No family? - No one claim me. I'm a bastards kid. My dad left my mom before I even knew him. And so she's so upset. She don't even like to look at me. 'Cause I'm the bastard's bastard. - I'm sorry. - No need to be. Hey, that's the way the cards were dealt. What you gonna do? - We need take 285 just a little bit. - Got it. - Hey, Mark man, we need to make a supply run bro. One like a bourbon run. (car engine roaring) - [Emma] That's Megan. - [Jesse] Who? - [Emma] My sister. Megan? Meg, what happened to you? Answer me. - We almost made it out (spooky music) - You're scaring me. What does that mean? Megan, what does that mean? - John took Rachael, there was nothing I could do. - Megan, Megan. No, no, no, wait- (growling) (screaming) (somber music) - We need to go. (crying) - Come on come on come on! - [Mark] Emma, I'm so sorry about how this all ended. (spooky music) - This whole thing is a living, breathing nightmare. - [Brandon] Come on, get this thing started. - Are you okay? - You know you remind me of my niece. (car engine roaring) She was just a child, and just as sweet. - [Mark] Emma get in the car. - If I had kids I'd just like them to be as the two of you. (car engine roaring) - [Brandon] Emma come on, get in the car. - Emma, Emma, come back! Emma! (shouting) (screaming) (car screeching) (car engine roaring) (spooky music) (car engine roaring) (spooky music) (dramatic music) (gunshot) - [Mark] Stay in the car! (screaming) Brandon, Brandon! (gunshot) Brandon, come on. Come on Brandon. - Oh shit! Just get out, save yourself! - [Mark] No, Brandon no. - [Brandon] You need to getting go, save yourself. - [Mark] Brandon! Go, go, get to the car. - Come on motherfuckers, is that all you got? (growling) (spooky music) (growling) (car tires screeching) (spooky music) (car engine roaring) - What are you doing? (gun corking) (gunshot) - Sorry, I know you believe in that kind of shit, but maybe Brandon's right. What kind of God will let this happen, to Sarah to Emma, to Brandon, to anyone? - I didn't say it made sense, it doesn't. Emma and Brandon were my friends too. All I know everything happens for a reason. - I turned to speak to God about the world's despair, but to make bad matters worse, I found God wasn't there. - What is that? - Something that my mom used to say when my dad died. Maybe she was right. I'm sorry, Grace. - My uncle's place should be just up this road. (car engine roaring) (coughing) - Okay Grace, come on. Run, run, this way. Run. Grace, Lyrics You better walk fast okay? (growling) - This is far enough, you can go. - I am Leaving her. - You don't have to do this. - Enough People have died on my watch. I'm coming with. (growling) Guys, go, go! (growling) - [Mark] Okay, go, go. Come on. It's okay, its okay. Here, here, come on, come on! Hurry hurry! (growling) Watch Grace for me. (growling) Come on, let's go. (growling) (gunshot) - Come on, over there! (growling) (mumbling) You guys all right? Any bites? You thirsty? - Hey, your brother, super resourceful. - Yes he is. - He'll figure out a way to return to you. He's not gonna leave you I promise. - I'm scared. - You know what, me too. - They're warm, I've been rationing gas for the generator, but it's still tasty. - Thank you. Thank you. - Ben, Ben Clayton. - I'm Jesse. And you may know who this is. Grace, Mark is her older brother. - Of course yeah. - It's your uncle. Uncle Ben. I think you need to get some sleep. May I? - Of course. - Mi cassa, es.... your cassa. I got some canned tuna in the kitchen if you're hungry. Peanut butter too. - Canned tuna and peanut butter. Well beggars can't be choosers. So you live here alone? (chuckling) Until now. I lost all of them. We can hide at my house. I got food and water for weeks. But you're welcome to stay, both of you as long as you want. (spooky music) - Pa, someone's at that truck again. (growling) - No, oh my God. No, come on, start start start! (growling) (car engine roaring) - Mark and Grace plan to stay. - Of course. Family's family. - Thank you for taking us in. Mark says you're a prepper. - Does he now? Well I admit it. I secretly hope to see it. - You were hoping for this? You wanted it. - We had it coming. The baby killers, trans-whatchamacallits, everything. Couldn't have dreamed this up exactly, but the Lord does work in mysterious ways. - Well, I could use a little less mystery in my life. - They'll keep coming and coming. More and more of them every day. It's only a matter of time. (car engine roaring) (growling) - She's worried about her brother, that's all. - These are hard times for little things. Jesse, the world's been falling apart around us. We knew too much for our own good. Here we are paying the consequences. (suspense music) Are you ready? - For what? - The blessing? (banging) (car engine roaring) (growling) (dramatic music) - Get on him boy, where is your kill shot. (gunshot) You're a lousy goddamn shot. Give the gun to your sister. (gunshots) (screaming) Come on we gotta get that truck, let's go. (suspense music) (gun corking) You don't want to do that (spooky music) - Actually, would you hold these? Hand them me to me one at a time. (gun corking) (spooky music) This goes right about there. (spooky music) Ben was my friend. He let me stay in the camper outside the barn. I helped him with most of his projects. And then those demons out there bit him. Pick it up, pick it up. I had to put Ben down. Actually I don't think he minds I took his place. And you know, it is so nice having somebody around again. Jesse, you arrived just in time. To see Ben's vision through (bursting) Took Ben and I years to prepare, heck no, decades. Listen (bursting) - Hurry, Grace. Hey you're going to miss the best part! (car engine roaring) That crazy bastard's not your uncle. (car engine roaring) (growling) (somber music) bit - No, just a shot. You promise to look after Grace? - Mark? - I know it's difficult under the circumstances, but try make try to make the world a better place for her, please. - that's tall order. I know you can do it. You're..resourceful - Mark! - I love you. - Love you too. Please don't leave me. (somber music) Mark no! Mark, Mark! (somber music) I'm thirsty. I'll find us some water. - Do people get thirsty in heaven? - No. - Is there a soda pop in heaven? - All that you want, no belly aches. - Will Mark go to heaven? - I believe so. - Will the monsters be in heaven? - No, only good people like Mark. - Jesse? - Jesus will you shut up? I don't know, okay. I don't know everything. - Those monsters are in there. - Get behind me, go! (growling) (gunshots) Grace, get down! - No no no no! (gunshots) - There's more of them. (gunshots) That looks like one of our trolls. (gunshots) Hope none of those people are our subscribers. What are you young ladies doing way out here? We made a mess there, but they'll make a nice yard ornaments. My name Hickok45. - I'm Jesse, this is Grace. - Hi. - That's kind of strange, huh? - It's about YouTube Name, you see my videos, right? - No. - No. - Didn't think so. Didn't think so. (laughing) Well that was another world, another time. Why don't you all follow me? End of the world, when it comes right down to it, All a man needs a good cigar, a cup of coffee and an arsenal. An arsenal of weapons is good. - How many you got? (growling) - Jesse, I think you'll really like this 1911, has a sweet, sweet trigger. You wanna try that one? Find one of your targets out there. (growling) (gunshots) Okay, not bad. I think it'll help you if you get this left hand up on there, kind of a more comfortable grip instead of on the bottom of it. - Okay. - Just bring it up. Yeah, I like that, a little more support. Okay, try it. Take your time. (growling) (gunshots) Good job. It's a little big, isn't it? But shoots nicely, yeah. - It's kinda good. - Let me show you this one and I think that you'll really like the grip of a little better unless I'm mistaken, 'cause this one, this will fit your hand I think a little bit better. Try that, just get a feel of it. - It's good. - Does that feel good? - Yes, good. - Yeah, that's not. I thought you'd like that. Well, I wanna give you this, okay? Take with you. And I've got shots and shells in this bag and this pistol, if you take that, and then the shotgun is fully loaded, all right? So hopefully that'll get you through. - Thank you so much. (bursting) What was that? - That would be my nephew. What are you two up to? - setting booty traps? - I think you mean booby traps. - That's what I said, booty traps. - Very funny. - This is Jessie. She's a good egg. She'd been looking after a little one since Middle Creek city. - Boy or girl? - Girl. Her name's Grace. - Where's she at? - She's catching some Z's up on the porch. They need some wheels. You don't have any extra wheels, do you? - It's a bit much of a truck for her don't you think? - She's made it this far, she can handle this. You'll be fine. It'll get you from point A to point B. - I should go and grab Grace. Grace? - She's got it. - What, no. She didn't get bit. I don't understand. - She's tiny. Now that it's taken hold, it won't take long for it to take her. You gotta- - No, no. - There's no choice. You want her turn to one of those things? - I'll do it.
