Wow! Very good... very good. All of you are laughing a lot. How happy you look? It seems all of you are single. We Gujarati people buy any useless thing if we get money. One of my friends bought a bag worth Rs. 30,000. Another friend bought a smart watch worth Rs. 60,000. A man bought an entire bank... ...and another Gujarati man bought an entire vote bank. No... but seriously! A smart watch worth Rs. 60,000.. ..and what do you do with it? Basically smart watch is just like a boyfriend. Both are very expensive, are showpieces, and are never of any use. No no! Sorry... sorry sometimes they are of use. I mean... Smart watches. On top of it this species called boyfriend. So forgetful. He forgets his girlfriend's birthday. He forgets the anniversary. He forgets to bring his wallet. Sometimes he even forgets to earn money. That's right. That's right But everybody perfectly remembers that... ...in the final match at Sharjah on 24th April, 1998... ...Sachin Tendulkar scored 134 runs against Australia... ..which included 12 fours and 3 sixes, won Man of the Match... ...and made 1894 OD runs to create a record. Sachin... Sachin... Sachin... Sachin! Well all the committed girls raise your hand. Oh did you see? Mostly only those on the cheap seats at the back are committed. See, being in a relationship is like driving a car. A car consumes petrol. A boyfriend consumes inner peace. You can bang a car. A boyfriend can't be... If you date him he will think that you will marry him. We may learn driving on a piece of junk but does it mean we should buy it? And the most important thing. Apply brakes if you see danger ahead while driving a car. And what if you see danger ahead in a relationship? Yes... break up! That's all for tonight guys. I hope all of you enjoyed it and if you did enjoy... ...please subscribe to my Tik Tok profile, funnyharshita. Thank you so much. This is Harshita signing off. Thank you for being such a lovely audience. -Harshita one selfie. -Oh sure. Thank you. -Ma'am one photo. -Thank you so much. Oh yeah sure sure. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry sorry. Just a minute. Excuse me. Sorry... sorry. Sorry... sorry. Sorry guys. Sahil. Sahil where are you going? Wait. -Listen to me. -Don't touch me. What? I heard it. And not just me... all the others also heard it. -What? -And tomorrow the whole world will hear on the internet.. ..how your boyfriend is useless and good-for-nothing. I heard it. When did I say so? You said it just two minutes ago. Madam it was fun. -Mind blowing. -Hi! Myself Sahil. I am her boyfriend. Didn't she say that I am useless and good-for-nothing? -Didn't she say so? Tell me. -Please go. The parking attendant will charge double. Go. Please go. I was talking about boyfriends in general okay? To make people laugh. I see. Now I understand your plan. -You want to provoke me right? That you... -What is your problem... Sahil, I can't tolerate your daily misunderstandings. And I cannot tolerate you. What do you want to do? I want to end it. You will be free and I too will be free. So everything will end, right? Okay fine. Okay. Didn't you want this? Didn't you want this? Didn't you want this? Hey, have you gone crazy? There is a problem if I say something. There is a problem if I don't say something. Sahil, what is your problem? Look at yourself. Harshita why have you changed so much? Because you don't mend your ways Sahil. I am fine the way I am! Maybe your choice has changed! 'What happened was very wrong.' 'Was the time wrong or was it her?' 'Yes she was wrong.' -Come on... give me the bag. -Here. Take this. Quickly. Mister, drinking liquor openly is banned. For that matter plastic bags are also banned. Go away. Why should I bother? 'She ended the love of two years in just two minutes?' Hi. How are you all? Well first of all tell me how many of you are Gujarati? Who else would be there in Ahmedabad? Wow! So all are Gujarati. So all of you must have brought food from home right? How cute? If I say in Kolkata that all the Bengalis in the house... ...make some noise then all of them would go oolululu! I was teaching Hindi... sorry Gujarati to my Bengali friend. I told her that when she meets anybody... ...she should ask 'kem chaale chhe' (how is it going?) She had the habit of pausing at the wrong place. She asked a boy 'kem chaale chhe? (Well are you coming?) The boy asked her what is your name? She replied Aa chal (come along). -My friend Anchal bought the dress I am wearing. -Hey you! -Yes sir? -Play some nice music. Yes sir. How many of you are scared of escalators? My mother.. My... my mother is so scared that... Hello. She is so irritating. Thank you. Waiter, give me a Jain garlic bread. Garlic bread cannot be prepared in Jain style. -How rude that was? -Hi. Samosu. What? Sahil Mohanbhai Sutaria. My name. Mosu always says that... ...gargling completely cools down a person's anger. Who is Mosu? Mohanbhai Sutaria. My father. Here everybody says my old man. -Gargling cools down a person's anger. -Yes. -And sneezing three times cures acidity. -Yes. -Is your father a doctor? -He is a character. But this is guaranteed okay? I am telling the truth. Once, try it just once. I will look like an idiot, okay? People would laugh at me. Just five minutes ago nobody laughed right? I mean don't feel offended but aren't you angry about that? That is why I am telling you. Do try it just once. I insist. Usually I fall in love with a girl who is getting wet in the rain...' ...or who is drying her hair.' 'For the first time I fell in love with a girl on seeing her gargling.' How much should I pay you? Oh money. Say thanks to Mosu. -When is it? -What? When is the next show? Why? Did you like my jokes so much? I liked you. Day after tomorrow at 8 o'clock in the night. Does any one of you party at night? Or like go at 12 o'clock in the night and do disco dance? Some... Thank you. Something is getting connected somewhere. A favourite sweet dish is being cooked.

We realised it just now. But mother why are you panicking so much? She has a right to panic Sahil. She is your mother. -Look at that! -Of course. Have we ever restrained you? Since we are your parents isn't it your duty to inform us? -Yes. -Right? -Right dear? -Right aunt. What is right? We have confirmed it just now. -Yes, but... -What is right? Mother I... Father why are you not saying anything? -What? -It is your fault. Yes. Say sorry. -Sorry. -That's it. Now you say sorry to me. -Why me? -Didn't you bang my scooter? It is your fault.

'Basically smart watch is just like a boyfriend.' -Hasu is very funny. -'Both are very expensive...' ...are showpieces and are never of use.' Mother, turn off the video and give me tea. 'And it is of use also.' -'On top of it this species called boyfriend.' -Mother. 'So forgetful.' -Yes? -Give me tea. -Serve yourself. -Serve it here. He forgets to bring a gift. Sometimes...' Oh no... She sits there and keeps laughing. You and your maternal uncle... ...both want everything to be handed to them. -Here take this. -Give. Sit up and drink. You are harassing me. Sit up and drink. Where were you the whole night? At Ru.. Rutvik's house. Son, don't shake legs in the morning. 'Lakshmi' (wealth) won't come into the house. Lakshmi comes in the morning. Lakshmi comes in the afternoon. Lakshmi comes in the evening. Mother do one thing. Give me the timetable for Lakshmi's arrival and departure. Accordingly I will shake my legs. Why are you getting irritated? Your father has returned. -Hello sister-in-law. -Hello. -Both the brothers are here? -Yes. -Oh wow she has come back home? -Very good! What? She has come? Sister-in-law you should say it has come. Its gender is not feminine right? Brother he loves it more than me. -Oh! -So for me its gender is feminine right? Still you should not say so. -It was because of it... -We got married. -Yes. -I know. -Do you know why I don't get rid of this scooter? -Yes. Because this scooter keeps reminding me... ...that the value of relations and things do not diminish... ...when they become old. They become invaluable. Just like our romance of 28 years. What nonsense? You are becoming romantic in front of Tribhuvanbhai. I didn't see and hear anything. You can continue. -Bye see you in the evening. -What is there in the evening? Just like that. -It is Sunday so everybody do get together. -Oh! Bye! -Bye! -Bye. Come. -Oh the boss has returned? -Yes he has returned. Well my friend how was the funny night? -Mother. -Yes? Why there is less sugar in the tea? Harshita said that too much sugar in tea is not good. -I see. -Yes. So Harshita is going to decide what is good or bad for us. I am going to sleep. Listen. Before you go to bed tell Harshita that we are going out for lunch... ...so she should not make some other plan. Harshita won't come. Why? We broke off. What has happened? Break-off. What is it? Earlier we were together and now we are not. What? I didn't understand. It is like earlier Harshita and I were together... ...and now Harshita and I are not together. What does it mean Sahil? Speak in words I can understand. Mother it is like earlier Harshita and I were together... ...and now Harshita and I are not together! Both had a fight. Father! Our relationship is broken. What do you mean it is broken? Sahil you are going to get married! What is this boy saying? 'Hello where are you lost?' 'Do help me in fixing the curtain.' 'Hey!' 'May I know why you have changed this curtain?' 'Because this curtain is from your great grandfather's time.' 'Are you going to crack such jokes after marriage?' 'Decide whether you want to get married or not.' 'There is so much work. Don’t stare at me. Come here.' 'What is the problem with the bedsheet?' 'Hello this is not bedsheet.' 'It is a multi-course feast. Look at this.' 'Yesterday's cottage cheese curry.' This...' -'Hey. -Saturday's rice and curry.' -'And this one I don't even know what it is. -Taste it.' 'Yuck! It looks like fusion of bread-lentil and pasta Arabiata.' 'Now it will look like a room.' 'How much more interior designing remains?' 'This clock is the last one.' 'Who looks at a clock in today’s time? Don't we have mobiles?' 'Keep the mobile 10 feet away before going to bed okay?' 'But why are you pushing me?' 'Moments should be forgotten when they become memories.' 'But when things become memories?' They should be torn, broken, burnt and thrown in garbage.' Harshita brought each and everything in this room.' 'Even this T-shirt.' Your mother is making piping hot pancakes. Come down to eat. Okay. Are you crying? No. Then come let us have tasty pancakes. Go ahead I will come. No your mother told me to bring you along. I am naked. Naked. Shall I come? Shall I come as I am? No! You come after getting ready. Why after getting ready? We have to talk. About what? About your break-off. I don't want to talk. You don't have an option my friend. Your mother does want to talk to you. -I will come down. -Okay. -I will speak a little about break-off. -Okay. I will eat a couple of pancakes... ...and then I will come upstairs and go to sleep. Cool. Father. Father don't call up Harshita okay? -Okay. -What okay? I was not going to call her up but your idea is not bad. Father don't call her up okay? You are under the oath of your scooter. Oh no. Fine. I won't call her up. If you find it uncomfortable then sit here. I... Why? I am not sitting here to give any preaching. -No no. It is just... -What? -It means that... -What? Start. Hello. Manjula? Okay listen. -What is this father? -Bring the ironed clothes when you come. And listen we are not going to have lunch today... ...so there won't be utensils to clean... -...but do come to sweep and mop the house. -Hurry up. And I have started the machine... ...so hang out the clothes to dry. You are very forgetful. Yes. -Hello. -She can't give up talking. I won't talk now. I am in a preaching. I am busy. I will disconnect the phone. I will talk later. Bye. -Just a minute. Please put it on silent. -Give me the phone. -Hold it. -Yes. It is silent now. Start. -So... -Just a minute. Before we start... -...shall we call Harshita here? -No. -Why? -Why should she come to our house? Father tell me why should she come to our house to discuss? No I mean just like you are going to present your side... ...she too should present her side to us. So we can settle the issue. It has been settled mother. It has been settled completely. I am just sharing it with you. Just informing you that's all. FYI. What do you mean? FYI means for your information. That is why I tell you to watch English movies with me. It is very important to understand their language... ...in order to understand these people. Yes. But we have already informed our relatives. What now? Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Why are you panicking? What is the need to panic? Why are you panicking so much? -Should you get panicked so much? Why... -Listen listen... Relax. Relax. Relax. Okay? Restart. Father! Harshita is not what she was earlier. Try to understand. Along with her ideas her plans have also changed. Harshita has now no interest in family or marriage... ...or in living with me. Don't run so fast. -Hey... -You will hurt your knees. What are you doing? Fine. Let them hurt. -Okay listen. -Yes? I have decided to go to Mumbai. You will reach there if you run at this speed. This is the problem with you. You don't take anything seriously. I have decided to go to Mumbai. It will be good for my career. The whole industry is there. I have taken a couple membership for two years. I mean what is the need to go there? Isn't everything going on fine over here? I don't want to stagnate. I want to make progress. Currently each of my videos is getting 100 thousand to 150 thousand views. I will go there will meet people and perform at various places... ...then one zero will be added. But Mumbai and the film industry over there are not safe. Safe! I am not a little girl. Harshita, my mother and father are making plans… …for marriage and engagement and other things. So tell them that you are still not ready. Now tell me. She thinks that I am not ready. You may be ready but your pocket might not be ready. Children from now on he will teach you accounts. Good morning Sahil sir. -Sahil. Sahil. Sahil will be fine. -Hey! He had scored 100 out of 100 in accounts in Third Year. He is a gold medalist from IIM. A gold medalist. Children in your life you have to become like Sahil. Hard working, focused and career oriented. Tell me will you do that? -How is the enthusiasm? -High sir! Who said it? Who said it? What is it? Since the past 20 minutes I have been staring at you like an idiot. Do show some reaction. You are sitting with earphones stuck in your ears. Tonight is my first show with Comedy Factory okay? I'm really nervous. So I am watching their YouTube videos. I'm doing my homework. I see. I don't give homework to my students. I finish everything in the classroom only. I too crack jokes. People laugh also. That too without a mike. Harshita I suggest do perform once without a mike. You see nothing should come between us and the audience. Not even the mic. Mr. Sahil I know how to do my work. 1000 to 2000 followers are not increasing just like that. Even today I received 104 friend requests. Sahil there is no competition here. Where is the competition? How can there be a competition? I mean your career is different. Mine is different. What is your career? Oh! Hello. Oh have you arrived? -Who has come? -Okay, I am coming. Okay. Bye-bye. -Why did you order coffee for me? -Who has come? Dhwani Gautam. He is a very famous director... ...and he also owns a talent management company. He has fixed tonight's show for me so, bye. Why bye? Tell him to wait. I have ordered chocolate ganache with vanilla ice cream. -Money will go waste. -Sahil I cannot ask him to wait. He is going to get me the next shows okay? You know what the difference between latte and cappuccino is? -Let’s order lemonade. -And it is not ganache. Ganash. A person gets busy with work. Father I have no objection if she gets busy... ...but so busy that she won't pick up my phone call? -Hello. -Are you awake? -What time is it? -Two o'clock. Two o'clock? Hello! Doesn't your show end at 11 o'clock? Yes yes... it ended at 11 o'clock but then we stayed back. -Why? -To discuss the next show. You should tell them that you won't sit and discuss at midnight. Why be out till two o'clock? You should finish everything by evening. Can we talk about something else please? Tell me how was your day? You know? Today YouTube gave me the award of fastest 1,00,000 subscribers. They have sent a trophy home. Congratulations but we were going to talk about something else. How was your day? I woke up in the morning. I had breakfast. I went to the gym. Alone. I watched the match. Had a bath. I called you up. You didn't receive it. Harshita, we haven't met since past eight days. Sorry my Samosu. We will plan something soon okay? Why soon? Tomorrow morning we were supposed to have breakfast together. I won't be able to come. I am very tired. Okay I will disconnect. Okay bye. Not just Harshita but her world had also changed. And I was nowhere in that world. Son, do you want plain or spicy? Mother give me anything. -Wow. -Here. Wouldn't it be easy for me to serve if you sat with your father? Here. But I want only one. Eat it. There is lots of batter. I made provision for Harshita also while preparing it. But how would I know that both of you will get divorced suddenly? Do eat it or else there will be some leftovers. Let there be leftovers. Sister the work is finished. Have you hung out clothes for drying from the machine? Again you forgot? Go and hang them out to dry. -Listen. -Yes? Later come and eat pancakes. There is lots of batter. What batter? Mother just a minute. Mother just a minute. Come here. Come here. Come here. There is a great difference between divorce and breakup. What is the difference? Both are different things. So explain to me how the two are different. Father please say something. I would like to have one pancake. And listen if you can make something like 'Mysore Masala'... -...I would relish it. -Okay. What Mysore Masala? Such minor fights do take place. Minor fights? Father when it was the first anniversary of our love... ...I had come here from Boston. Why? To surprise her. But on the second anniversary she wants to party not with me... ...but with the people of Comedy Factory. Acting smart. Is the party over? Who are you? Where are you all? Are you okay? Do you want to drink water? Drink a little. Relax. Move aside. Sahil. Hi Sahil. This is Harshita in the house. Where were you? Where were you? -At Manan's party. -Do you go to party? Don't get angry. Don't get angry. Here gargle. -Gargle. -Harshita. Harshita are you okay? Hey move away. Keep away. This is too much. It was so much fun. Hey Sahil today is our second anniversary. Happy anniversary baby! Let's go party. -Let's go party. -Harshita. You should sleep. You are drunk. 'I am in trouble.' 'I was not supposed to tell this.' Please get me the tin of sugar. Carefully. -How many times a week does she drink? -Hey. What do you mean by she drinks? She is not a drunkard. In our generation it is occasional. Everybody drinks a little. And I have no objection if she drinks. Didn't father also used to drink? He had taken a drink and gathered courage and eloped with you. Didn't father also used to drink? Hey, after marriage he hasn't even had a drop. And he stopped smoking also after a heart attack. But it was not a heart attack. I am going to sleep. We will talk later. Wait Sahil. Wait. -Tell me. -Where were you the whole night? Mother I told you. -At Rutvik's house. -You too drink don't you? Mother why are you stuck on the same point? Harshita and I do not open a bottle every night. It happens. It is the culture of current times. How was it in your times? You used to go to a garden... ...and used to feel shy in front of each other for no reason. Mother all that has changed now. Did you know about this? I didn't now but I should know right? The boy has grown up. -Sahil. -Yes. In the future you won't even touch alcohol. That's final. Are you the mother from '70's films? Are you going to place my hand on your head and make me swear on your life? She is being so dramatic. Your father used to smoke heavily... ...and that is why you had to wear glasses. -Why are you raking up old issues... -Don't interfere. If one of the parents is addicted... ...it directly affects their children. Addicted? Is your mind working? Do you have brains? When you were young... ...you had eye glasses and I used to follow you daily... ...with carrot juice so that your eyes would not need the glasses. And every night I used to make you do... ...eye exercises before you went to sleep. -Do you remember? -I do remember. And I also remember that later I used to have a splitting headache. -Do you remember? -Yes! So didn't you remember all that when you held... ...a glass of alcohol in your hand? Mother, this is not my point at all? Anyway you are not going to understand my point. -Forget it. -Is that so? Yes it is so. Looking at you nobody can say... ...that you left the village and came here 30 years ago. You are still a fourth class fail, uncivilized village woman. Oh no. Mother... Sahil. Oh no. Despite being uncivilized village woman... ...she has accepted the concept of girlfriend. And not only that... ...she has made Harshita a part of our family. She has asked or told about every major or minor things... ...related to our family. On every occasion she has said... ...that we must invite Harshita. What she is saying right now... ...is for your and Harshita's health. In fact... ...she has not misunderstood. You have. You are not able to understand her. Shall we have tea? -I will make it. -No no... I will make it. -Sahil. -Yes? -Go out and get some sugar. -Okay. I will go and get some sugar. First say sorry. Sorry. Take 50 extra. Buy a chocolate for yourself. Are you okay or do you want to gargle? I am okay. Children. Children. I have observed. You laugh whenever I speak in English. That is because you look very beautiful. Stop it. The tea will get over boiled. Where are you lost? I used to understand Sahil very well when he was young. Even if he didn't tell anything I would know... ...that the teachers had scolded him that day... ...or that he had a fight in the school. But now I feel as if I don't know this boy at all. At first Sahil said that Harshita is his friend. Then he said that Harshita is his special friend. Then he said that Harshita is this family's future daughter-in-law. And now he says that Harshita is nobody? A man bought an entire bank...' ...and another Gujarati man bought an entire vote bank.' -No but seriously...' -Take this. ...a smart watch worth Rs. 60,000...' -'...and what do you do with it?' -Okay. -Here take this. -Take. -'Basically smart watch is just like a boyfriend.' -Look here! -Give me a chocolate. -What? 'Are like a showpiece and is never of use.' No no. Sorry sorry... sometimes it is of use.' 'Smart watch. On top of it this species called boyfriend.' Close...' 'It seems there is nobody in the house.' 'What is the plan?' The plan is to take our love story further ahead.' 'But this is the first time.' -'Okay. -So forgive me if I make mistakes.' 'Rest you can do whatever you can.' -'Okay. -Come.' 'Let's go.' This...' 'Wow.' 'How is it?' 'Amazing.' -'Did you like it? -Yes.' So then...' 'let's chill on the bed' 'Okay. Josu and Mosu are not home so Samosu is hot.' 'No no I mean it is not that.' 'I was just thinking about music. Here is the remote.' 'Yes. Look let us dance since there is music.' 'What was it? That step?' 'What are you doing?' -'It is a dance. Which step is it? -Shall we change the music?' 'Okay?' -'A bit... -It is a bit soft isn't it?' 'Shall we create the mood?' I never saw you coming. Until you turned me around. Used to think I was nothing. Look at this love we found. So give me your hand... You can take mine. No, I don't ever want to see you cry. No more tears... No more tears... Take that chance. We'll be fine. No, I don't ever want to see you cry. No more tears... No more tears... I never saw you coming. Until you turned me around. Used to think I was nothing. Look at this love we found. Are you missing her too much? No. Is there no chance? No I mean I don't think so. By now she must have told her parents. I don't think so. Had it been so, your father-in-law would have called up by now. Sorry, your ex-father-in-law. Since he is ex now shall I ask you something? What? Does he seem to be too enthusiastic to me or is he really like that? -He is... -He is? I always tell Harshita that your father is very enthu-cutlet. -Enthu-cutlet. -Enthu-cutlet? When we place a cutlet on stove it goes... Enthu-cutlet. Look if I talk about myself, your mother and I have fought a lot. Fight? I remember only one fight. Mother took me to my maternal uncle's house for 10 days... ...and checked out a new school for me and... -What was it exactly? -A typical thing. We used to stay in a rented house. It was Diwali time and we were financially constrained. At that time we didn't own four spectacles shops. I used to go from town to town carrying sample pieces. It was Diwali time so the neighbours... ...used to send something or the other to our house. Sometimes dry fruits... ...sometimes 'Badam Puri' (sweet dish made with almonds). Yes 'Badam Puri'. I used to relish it. Your mother also thought... ...that we too should send 'Cholafali'... ...and 'ghughra' (salted snack and sweet stuffed dumplings). Well in those days we didn't even have utensils to fry them. Your mother wanted new utensils and you wanted crackers. Every night when I returned home... ...you would ask only one question. Father, when will we go to buy crackers? I deliberately use to return late... ...so that I wouldn't have to answer you. Very soon the night of Diwali arrived. But I couldn't manage to get money. Next? I didn't have the courage to come home... ...so I went and sat with your uncle Tribhuvan. When I came home you were asleep... ...but your mother again asked the same question. Utensils? I was a bit drunk. Yes. So I banged all the utensils in the house... ...and I abused her in a raised voice. At that time she didn't say anything. She went to sleep without a word. But when I woke up in the morning I found out... ...that she had gone to her brother's house along with you. I got angry and went to her brother's house. I don't need her. After a few days I felt very lonely on seeing the empty house. I wrote her a letter. Come back home. She refused and said that she will tolerate everything... ...but not my raised voice. Then somehow I brought both of you back home. Son what I mean to say... ...is that ever after all this happened... ...the three of us are together. Happily ever after. But there still remained regret in this happily ever after life. Regarding what? -I and your mother had eloped and got married. -Yes. So I didn't have a wedding procession. And I like wedding processions very much. So I was going to fulfil my unfulfilled wish... ...by dancing in your wedding procession. Oh I see. But now you are divorced. Father why mother and you Keep calling it divorce? Between divorce and breakup... -There is a very big difference. -Yes. -I remember. Yes. -Yes. He is talking nonsense. Hey get ready. We have to go for lunch. No I don't want to go for lunch. Why? Will Hasu be there? Yes. Hasu will be there and both of us... ...are going to have a nice candlelight lunch. -Do come. -Stop it. He won't come right? Why should I be a spoilsport? Take mother on date. Today is special. Rubbish. He doesn't even remember that today is special. He hasn't even wished me. But I have. Would someone wake me up from sleep and wish in this manner? I almost had a heart attack. Can you come here? This... I suggest we should try to explain to the children... ...that there is nothing like a breakup. Stop fighting and think about Gandhiji. On this day it will be as you say. Yes mother. Give a suggestion about where to go for lunch. Mother go anywhere. Gujarati lunch platter is the same everywhere. No I don't want to eat Gujarati lunch platter. Today I feel like eating something fine and tasty. This time? Oh God. There is a nice restaurant near Bodakdev. I Love Sandwich House. Go there. Sandwich? Oh no. Are you going to feed bread to your mother? Didn't I tell you? Fine! Tasty food is not in my fate. After ages, I had got in the mood. -What is this? -But... Mother. Mother. Mother.

You go now. -Give me a chocolate! -It's over. Just look at him. He kept it in his pocket. Lift... lift... lift... wait! You would have died. You should have walked up the stairs instead. Hey what are you doing? Sister, uncle was saying that you trouble him a lot. -Bye uncle! -How cheap you can be! I told him about girlfriends in general. Why did you bring them here? I did not bring them. No sooner than they came to know, they brought me here. You already told them? Didn't you tell them? I am not immature like you. Are you all going up? We are going to Mother Goddess's temple. I see. He is asking us are you going up... Are you waiting for an auspicious time to say? I am definitely not going to advertise on Facebook. Did you receive calls from everyone? Did you get sympathy? What do you think? Have I done all this for getting sympathy? -Obviously! -Don't insult me! What else should I do? Should I praise you? -Welcome son! Welcome! -Please come... Your hair has grown a lot... What are you doing? You will damage his hair. What are you doing? Don't seek my blessings. I am only four years elder to you. Come in I will show you something interesting. Come. Son the wedding planner has sent various styles for your wedding. I will show you. Yes! First style! Jodha Akbar! Everything in Mughlai style right from food to the decoration. -So do you know how will you take an entry? -How? Riding on an elephant! That means you will enter swaying... ...and from behind the song will be played... The great emperor is arriving. We will always salute him! Surround system! Dolby Digital! You didn't like it? Don't worry. He has sent another style as well. Yes! This one! You like a Greek God and my daughter Harshita... -...like a Greek Goddess! -Yes! Both of you will come walking and all around there will be... ...huge broken boulders and Roman pillars. And at the back... It's over! One minute! There is also a third style my favorite! -Oh my... -See this! Avenger's style! You like an Iron Man and my daughter, Wonder Woman! I know there is no Wonder Woman in Avengers... ...but the thing is I have added that as it is my favorite character. You will be wearing iron clothes and will be seated... ...in a rocket and you will directly land in the wedding dais. And as soon as you enter, all around you will be... ...Hulk, Black Panther and that... What? -Spider Man! -Yes! -All this because children love them. -Yes. -Sahil! -Yes! -Please come in for a minute! -Right away! -And son listen! -Yes! If you did not like this style there is a fourth style as well. Japanese style! And listen! First time in Ahmedabad... ...we will keep Momo counters! Hey, explain to your father that Momos are from Nepal and not from Japan! Good for nothing! Even I know how to abuse parents. But I don't wish to do that. They are standing downstairs. Tell me what is it now? Hurry up. What should I wear for your parents? Wear whatever you like! No matter what you wear you will never look beautiful. You leave! -No the way you are asking on Facebook... -Just... -...what should I wear? -just get out of my room! What should I wear? -And all that nonsense! -Get out of my room! I hope we are not exaggerating? We still do not know the real reason for their breakup. But do you think Harshita will speak to us freely? That is what we have to see. They have come. They have come. She is looking so beautiful isn't it? Yes. And your son looks like a monkey. Hey what is this? From so long you've been saying your son, your son? Is he not your son also? Has he directly landed in my lap from the sky? -Come children! -Come come. -Son you ride. -Come. You come here. So I am free. -Father! You ride peacefully. -Okay. Here wear this cap. It is very hot. Yes. Take this. Great! Wear it without creating a scene. -Hey balloons balloons! -Balloons! Balloons! Yes! -Give me! -Sister take this. -Here... thank you! -Balloons! Balloons! Red balloons! Anyone wishes to buy! Yes tell me. Yes. Yes. Take this. -Please come! -Oh! It's a lovely place! They are playing games on every table here. -Hello sir! -Hello. -I will get menu card. -Thank you. Nice! Good place! Thank you to you too because... It is because of you both that we get to see new places... ...otherwise she only feeds me Egg plant bread lentil rice and curry. And when you get all this together it becomes... ...a complete Gujarati meal. Right? But what is wrong in a Gujarati meal? Harshita you tell me. There is variety as well as home made. Mother you must eat at home only then. Why do people go out? To try something new isn't it? -Right! -Yes. You know me. I always love trying something new. There is always a fight between me and your mother on this. Do they know about our first fight? -Yes! It was a solid story. -Yes. On our wedding reception... ...I mean we eloped and got married. We then had a grand reception. -Harshita! -Yes! -This is worth hearing. -Okay. So, on our wedding reception... This was in 1991! Your grandfather had arranged a dinner... ...that was 175 rupees per plate! Everything was included in that. South Indian, Punjabi... Gujarati... and Chinese! At that time what is that... ...fried rice and Manchurian... ...were just launched in India. From morning I was waiting eagerly to eat fried rice and Manchurian. Now whose reception it is... ...I mean the couple like you both are... I mean like we both are. -We are supposed to eat in one plate. -Yes. -Now I wanted to eat... -Fried rice. Okay then? Yes. And your mother wanted to eat lentil and rice. We started fighting. Since then till today fighting over food but together in life. Why are we discussing this now? What do you mean why? When we all sit together it is fun to remember old memories. -Is that so? -Okay. Forget about us. -What do you both fight about? -I knew it! I very well knew the way you were talking where it was leading to. By the way Harshita is aware... ...that you already know that we had a breakup. No my child it is not that... Aunty sorry but even I will feel awkward. It's better that we don't discuss this... Sir! Yes! -Mojito! -Sir it is Mojito. But in the menu card it is written as Mojito. Such a famous hotel and printing like this... Sir even I am a Gujarati. -Is that so? -Yes! Take this away! Okay. See how he pronounces Mojito. Mojito is a Spanish drink. In Spanish 'J' is pronounced as 'H'. Is that so? How do they pronounce 'H' then? Hey cheating cheating. You are doing cheating. Come we will also play some games. -Yes. -You won't know how to play. What games and all that? Have you come here to play games? -But... -Oh no! He just ruins our mood. -Jenga! -We can play Jenga! Yes! See Jenga! -Hey Josu! -Yes! What is Jenga? Thank God! I am saved! Now I understood! You must make it like a card mansion and not break it. And the one who breaks it he gets... Punishment! -Here take this! -Yes! Reveal a secret about somebody on this table. Aunty that means you will have to tell a secret... ...about anyone of us. Okay like that! Samosu... ( Stuffed dumpling) I didn't want to play. Why did I start playing all this? -Hey! -No no... you don't have any option! Your mother wishes to speak. -Mother! -Yes! -Don't tell about that. -What? Which matter? -Mother... -That one! -Oh yes! Tell it! -Father you also! -It cannot be told here. -What is it? -Wait wait! -What is it? It is nothing. There is nothing like that! -Son! -There is nothing like that! One minute! I wish to hear. -Yes you tell her. Tell her. -Come on tell me. When Sahil was small... -Mother quiet! -At that time.. You keep quiet. When I would not allow him to go to down to play... ...he would undress himself and run around the entire house. Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! You never told me this? Is this anything to talk about? -But you should have told me. -Just see it is working. -Do we have to talk on this topic? -It is working. Say one good thing about the person to your right. Yes! That means Harshita should say something good about Sahil. -Okay! -This should be worth hearing. She might not have anything good to say about me. Let's move ahead. Come on. Sit quietly now. -Yes my dear tell us. Tell us. -Yes. Sahil... ...is very supportive. Good. Thank you. Let's move ahead now. Come on. Hey you don't... You speak. What I am in my career today is all because of Sahil's support. Thank you! London bridge is falling down, falling down. -"London bridge is falling down...' -Father no... -"Falling down... it fell down!" -Oh no! What is it? Confess one thing about the person on your left. I never wanted to sit here. I unnecessarily... -No no! No excuses now. -Look... Just confess. Confession means... -What is in your heart... I understood. -Yes. Harshita... Harshita is a nice girl. That means nice in what way? I mean... In all respects. What do you wish to say? He is lying. He does not feel so. No Harshita I am not lying. Leave aside our breakup but what I said just now is... That's it! I just wanted to say this much. -Look at this! -Oh no! Yes. Gift something to the person sitting opposite you! Wow! Gift! Come on give me. Uncle! No no! This is not for the game. We already brought this gift for you. This is for your first show that was houseful. -Yes. Take it my child. Take it. -Take it. -Accept it. -Yes. Uncle no! I cannot accept this. Please! Hey this is... this is nothing! I have arranged a success party for you on Saturday night. Invite all your comedy friends. Tell them there is a cocktail party to follow. All branded stuff! Your uncle Tribhuvan will arrange for all the bottles. Uncle cocktail? But I don't... -Sahil told us that you do take at times. -Yes. One minute! Water! I said that by mistake. Harshita one minute! By mistake you must have also told them... ...that I was not a virgin before I met you. I had many boyfriends before you. And I am also sure that by mistake you must have told them... ...that Harshita is such a characterless girl. I never said anything like that! By mistake even I can say something about you... ...as to how you got addicted to betting due to which... ...you had incurred a debt of four lakhs. And you took money from me so that... ...they do not come to your house to recover that money. And you must have definitely told them that... ...you did not leave the coaching classes but you were thrown out. It is nothing like that... I never wanted to do that job. Why didn't you want to do that job? Hey... I had other plans! I have been hearing this since the past six months. What are your plans? Are you going on Mars? Harshita come with me. Harshita wait a minute. Harshita lets order food. -Mother... father... -I don't want to eat. Okay? Harshita! -Leave my hand! -Harshita one... I found it very strange! She left without even informing us? Mother! Father! Let's go. My child till date you have taken all your decisions. And I wish that you only decide about this now. What is this? The proof of my moving on. Move on? Since morning such difficult words are making me... Sahil say something that we can understand. When you move ahead in life leaving behind your old relations... ...that is called as moving on. I have decided that I do not wish to fall in love anymore. That's my biodata. I am now ready for an arranged marriage. Sahil Sutaria. Age 26. Educational qualification MBA gold medalist from IM Ahmedabad. Mother no sooner they read this much you will start getting calls... ...with a wedding proposal. -What happened? -No no! In an arranged marriage... ...you also need a job with your educational qualification. The profession column that is below... ...the educational qualification column is blank. What shall we write in that? We will write in that... That... Professor of accounts. But you have left that job. Those people are giving me a better offer so I will take it. MBA gold medalist! -Accounts professor. -So what? What's wrong in being a professor? No my son! No job is bad that is if you do it diligently. There is a column for income under the profession column. Like Harshita other girls won't let go in such cases isn't it? There is no need of a biodata then. Mother, your friend... who is that one... ...who stays in Surendra Nagar? -Pravina! -Yes Pravina! Pravina! Her daughter is still not married isn't it? Call and tell her that I am ready to meet her. You call if you wish to meet her. Mother will not call. Mother whatsapp me the number I will speak to her my way. -Listen! -Yes? Call Harshita's parents as well. Tell them that you have decided to move on. They too might want to make Harshita's biodata... -Enough father! -Enough of you fooling yourself. Give yourself proof of moving on. Not us. Sahil! Sahil! Don't provoke him at such times. What if he does something untoward? The problem is that he does not do anything. Kinjal! How are you? Fine? Where are you now? Okay Goa? Great! Family? Family? Okay boyfriend... Aarohi! What are your dinner plans? Don't do that then! We will go on my bike and have eggs. Okay you are fasting today. Hi Eshadi! What are your plans? Which way? If you don't have any plans then let's go to Gandhinagar tonight. We will have dinner at the Dhaba and listen to old songs. I don't care a damn if Harshita has any problem. We had a breakup. Okay so you are in London. Hey, no no... Deeksha what are you talking about rebound? Are you out of your mind? Actually this was going on for a long time so I told you... Oh no! Okay then. I will call you again later. Hero, what happened?' 'Is no one giving you any importance?' 'No one wishes to meet you?' 'Try calling Vyoma.' 'I will also try calling Parineeti.' 'But henceforth I will never call you to meet me.' -'Trying to act smart. -My Samosu is angry?' -'Won’t I be angry?’ -You meet once in ten years.' Forget about me but that gym instructor was also telling me.' 'Is madam interested in building her body or not?' 'What are you saying? This is not right.' 'Come I will set your mood right.' 'Day after tomorrow is my first public show.' 'No sooner the booking started in two hours it was housefull.' -'Housefull means? -I have kept tickets for you.' 'Okay. I am honored okay. I am honored that you have kept a ticket for me.' I will see your first and last public show live...' -'Last? -After that you will go to Mumbai right?' You will organize great shows in Mumbai...' ...and then long distance relationships and then it won't be fun you know?' 'Okay I will make your mood still better.' -'Mumbai... -You are not going right?' 'You are not going isn't it? I knew it.' 'I knew you would not be able to stay without me.' 'No I am not going to Mumbai right now.' -'I have decided... -Yes.' -'We will get married. -Yes.' -'You will start your job. -Yes.' 'You also take a transfer to Mumbai then.' 'Sounds like a plan right? What?' 'Hey! Did you get your offer letter?' -'No! -Why?' 'I will go and pick it up later. Why such haste?' 'I will pick it up later.' 'Sahil why do you take this so lightly?' 'People yearn for such jobs.' 'One minute!' 'You did not give this interview as well right?' 'What do you mean by this interview? What have you started again?' 'What do you mean by not gone for this interview?' 'You are joking.' 'Sahil I know.' 'What do you know?' 'That's enough now! I am feeling ticklish.' -'You are looking very sexy. -Yes.' 'Tell me how was your interview?' 'Like how an interview is.' 'Hey not like that! What did they say?' 'The same thing again and again.' The same questions and the same answers...' ...and you will get a call if you are selected. Just the normal routine.' 'But what was their reaction?' 'Reaction...' -'Brilliant Sahil brilliant! -Really?' 'Brilliant Anand brilliant!' 'You have a very strong chance!' 'And we also want employees like you who are confident and risk taking.' 'Just pray that the competition is not tough.' 'We also want employees like you who are confident and risk taking.' 'Just pray that the competition is not tough.' 'Hey have this! I have ordered for Chocolate Ganesh. Have it.' 'Shall I order for Vanilla ice cream for you?' 'Have it.' 'Whenever Sahil lies his legs shake.' 'He never knew about this but I knew.' 'That day he was lying.' 'Mother and father are planning the engagement and the wedding.' 'So tell them that you are still not ready.' 'What do you mean by I am not ready?' 'I am educated. I love you.' 'What more do you want than that?' 'According to you is that enough?' 'Oh! Okay!' 'I don't have a job right?' 'If I wish I can get a package of fifty lakhs. Fifty lakhs!' -'What are you saying... -I have heard this also fifty lakhs times.' 'You know what? I am done.' 'Harshita! Harshita!' Listen! Why do you think that I can't get a job?' -'When did I say that? -What did you say then?' 'If you are getting a job do it.' 'With that your problem will get solved right?' -'What problem? -One minute!' -'Hold this! -What?' 'I will be back in ten minutes.' 'Sahil!' 'He returned in ten minutes with a job.' He became an accounts professor just to show me...' ...and not for himself.' 'He does not know what he wants to do.' 'Some people know what they want to do but some people take time.' 'And I wished the same that Sahil takes time before marriage.' 'Who has come? Who has come?' Dhwani Gautam! He is a very famous director...' ...and he also has a talent management company.' 'He has given me tonight's show so bye.' 'My concern for Sahil became a misunderstanding for him.' 'And because of that misunderstanding he started losing faith in me.' -'Hi Dhwani! How are you? -Hi!' -'I am good. How are you? -Very good.' 'Were you in a meeting?' 'No I was having coffee with my boyfriend.' So tell your boyfriend to get habituated to having coffee alone...' ...because Harshita Mehta is going to become a great star.' -'Oh please! That's sweet! -Harshita!' Chocolate Ganache!' 'Thank you.' -'This is Sahil... -Hi! Sahil!' -'Her boyfriend. -Yes she told me.' -'Dhwani! I have my own... -Yes she told me.' -'So shall we leave? -Yeah!' -'Let's go. -Which way are you going?' 'What?' 'I have a show so we are going for the rehearsal.' 'Did you get advance payment?' -'What? -Advance payment!' 'Did you give her?' 'My company pays the artist after the job is done.' -'I think we discussed this. -Yeah yeah of course...' 'Harshita don't work without an advance payment.' Yes I mean don't feel bad but many such companies...' ...open in the morning and close down in the evening.' -'Sahil! -We will have to see to our safety isn't it?' I am so sorry. Actually as we did not discuss this earlier so...' 'I am sorry Harshita. I think both of you first discuss.' 'We will forget about this show. We will do something in future.' 'Dhwani!' 'Nice meeting you.' 'Okay!' 'What did I do?' After two days what time I leave home...' ...what time I return home who do I meet? What do I do?' 'Sahil started keeping a watch on me.' 'Sorry my Samosu. We will plan something soon. Okay?' 'What do you mean soon?' 'We were supposed to have breakfast together tomorrow morning.' 'I will not be able to come. I am very tired.' 'Okay I will disconnect now. Okay bye.' 'Sahil started thinking that my world is changing.' But just so he doesn't feel that, I called him again.' 'Tomorrow morning 8:30 am at breakfast club or Iscon Gaathiya?' 'Tell us what do you have piping hot for breakfast?' 'Vanela'(Hand-made gram rolls) 'Fafdaa' (thick and crisp fried sticks)' Bhavnagri' (noodle shaped gram sticks) etc... -'Okay do one thing then. Give me 250 grams of 'Fafdaa'... -Okay.' -'250 grams of 'Vanela'. -I want to eat 'Bhavnagri'.' -'You want to eat 'Bhavnagri'?

'Quickly go and get it.' See what he says...' 'Good we did not go to Breakfast Club.' Yes! They serve us sweet 'Handvo' (mix cereal vegetable cake)...' ...in the name of pancake. Useless people.' 'Sweet vegetable cake? I will use this joke in my show.' -'Is that so? -Yes.' 'Why only this joke? I will lay my life for you.' Next time if I get confused while writing jokes...' ...I will bring you to Iscon Gathiyaa only.' -'So I will wish that you get confused every day. -Yes?' 'I mean we will write jokes we will eat gram crispy sticks.' 'We will go to the gym. We will enjoy life.' -'Life full of fun right? -Yes.' -'Come on bring it quickly! -Hurry up!' -'Yes here are your hot piping gram crispy sticks. -Oh my God!' 'Great!' -'See there sir. -It's delicious isn't it?' 'Good morning sir!' All of you here... have you come here to have gram crispy sticks?' -'No! We have come to roll them. -Yes.' 'We got leave as you had a stomach ache.' 'But sir shall I give you free advice?' 'You should not eat gram sticks when you have stomach ache.' 'Hey she is that one isn't it? Her jokes are awesome.' -'They will screw me. -Follow her on Instagram.' 'You will enjoy!' 'Sahil I know!' 'What do you know?' 'You go to give interviews but you don't attend them.' 'What nonsense are you talking?' 'You go to give interviews but you don't attend them.' 'You are just blabbering.' 'Sahil you can talk to me.' 'Please! Talk to me.' 'Come I will drop you home.' -'It's getting late. -Your American internship also...' ...you left halfway and returned in six months.' 'Sahil I read your Emails.' Your seniors tried their best to stop you but...' ...but you did not even send an answer to them.' 'Why Sahil?' 'Come let's go! Day after tomorrow you have your show right?' 'You might have to go for rehearsal for that.' 'Come you will be late.' -'Why do you want people to wait for you. -Sahil!' -'Come let's go. -Sahil please...' -'Please... -Why did you read my emails?' 'Why did you read my emails?' 'Do I check your phone?' 'Do I check your messages?' 'You are spying on me?' 'Sahil I wanted to help you.' 'I don't want your help!' 'Keep quiet! I don't want your help.' 'Chill Sahil! Relax!' 'You are trying to dominate over me?' 'All the time… why don't you work? Why don't you do this?' 'Go and give interviews take up a job. Why?' 'Sahil I am concerned for you.' 'You are concerned about me. Great! Very good.' 'You are not concerned about me. You are ashamed of me.' -'No Sahil it is not like that. No! -It is like that!' 'When your friends ask you what does your boyfriend do?' 'You don't have an answer then.' You might be feeling shy to say that...' 'My boyfriend does not do anything.' 'He sits at home and enjoys his life.' -'Sahil it is not like that Sahil... -It is like that!' 'What am I doing? What am I up to?' 'Come.' 'Come I will drop you home.' 'You have to prepare for your show isn't it?' 'Let's go.' 'And then I have to go for interviews.' -'No please... -I have to focus on that now. Focus!' -'Come. -No!' 'Take your bag. Come on.' 'Come on take your bag.' 'No!' 'Leave!' He is sleeping. Shall I wake him up? No aunty! This is... Sorry aunty! I... I will not be able to come today evening. I can understand. No! It's not that! As I am going to Mumbai today I have to do my packing. But I spoke to uncle Tribhuvan and have arranged... ...everything for today evening. So... I will leave now. Mother! Are you awake? Yes, I mean... I just woke up. Harshita is going to Mumbai tonight. Son why did you breakup? She could never understand me. Only she could understand you. But now after the divorce it is pointless talking about all this. Mother! Mother! Between divorce and breakup... The only difference is marriage. Son the only thing left was staying together. Hail Lord Sitaram! I have brought the flowers. Sister-in-law you are still not ready... -Softly! -You are still not ready? But why did you come early? The best man has to come early. But we still have to arrange the flowers. We still have to do the decoration. I will do all that. You go out and see that no one comes in. Yes I will see to that. So good for nothing! Why are you standing like a statue here? Don't you want to get ready? Why are you so dressed up? Don't you know? Ask your mother. Now look at him! Mother what preparations are going on here? Why is he telling me to get ready? Flowers and everything have come. Oh no! Oh no! I am so sorry mother! Oh no! How could I forget this day? Mother it just slipped out of my mind. Mother all this and all that... Mother I am really sorry. Happy anniversary. Okay. I am so sorry! It just slipped out of my mind. You tell me... let me do some work. What shall I do? Shall I arrange all the flowers? You just tell me. Shall I decorate them nicely here? -No! Let it be. You let it be. -I will do everything. Your uncle Tribhuvan and Harshita have done everything. -But if you wish to do something. -Yes. -Keep your father busy. -Okay. -And see that he does not come out of the room. -Okay. Fine. I will not allow him to come. I will stop him. Mother! Happy anniversary. Mother you know... You are the world's best mother. And I am the worst son. Happy anniversary! Go now! Father... Happy anniversary. Thank you! You remembered? Father I can never remember birthdays and anniversaries. Since past two years Harshita would remind me... She should have reminded me today. But she never did. Why will she remind you now? After what you have done she is not responsible for anything. Correct! I have done everything and it is only my fault. She is not at fault at all. I have been hearing this since morning. -I don't wish to say anything. -No you speak. Say all that you wish to say once and for all. You speaking at intervals troubles me. Take this! Gargle first. -Everything... -You are angry... ...and in anger, a person... ...only hears does not listen. Take this! Tell me. Do you know after your graduation I had a desire that... ...one day we both like friends should sit on the terrace with a bottle... ...and discuss about your future plans. The discussion would be the same typical one... ...which every father has with his son. But I wanted to do that being a little cool. But you turned out to be more than that. You brought Harshita for dinner the day I was going... ...to discuss this with you. So we could not discuss anything. But I felt at peace when I met Harshita. Great! My son has a good choice. And I told Josu... ...that our Sahil will never need our help now... ...if he ever gets confused. Harshita will take care of him. As it is he is going to listen to her now. Sahil will feel what she says more relatable and what we say typical. Children feel that only till college it's their responsibility... ...to be answerable to their parents. But it is not like that! In fact after college it is the responsibility of the parents... ...to stop asking questions from their children. We stopped asking questions... ...and you stopped talking to us. Since the past one and a half to two years... ...you have been taking jobs and leaving them. For months together you are sitting at home. What did you think... ...wasn't I observing all this? I was not asking you anything... ...but that does not mean... ...I was not concerned for you. I did not speak to you. Correct. But why didn't you question me? That is because I was sure... ...that Harshita would speak to you about this. I had faith in Harshita more than the concern I had for you... ...that she would help you. As to what you wish to do in life. She would push you into deep waters... ...and you would struggle to swim. And I also had immense faith... ...that she would never let you drown. But you never gave her a chance. When she started making an effort... ...you deserted her. When I told you that there is nothing wrong being an accounts professor... We had no problem if you wanted to do that job all your life. But you don't wish to make an effort to do anything... ...with the fear of failure or losing. That is what hurts me the most. What is it that you fear? If you don't face fear how will you overcome it? Harshita just wanted you to face your fears. Like a girl's father is concerned... ...as to what kind of a son-in-law will he get... ...in the same way a boy's father is also concerned... ...as to what kind of a daughter-in-law will he get. Harshita was that girl for you. She was just trying to take you out from your comfort zone. You said right. It is your fault. She is not at fault at all. Hey! Whose wedding procession is this beneath our house? -It is yours! -It is yours! Hey what are you all doing here? Just see what a beautiful turban I got for you. -Come on wear this! -But... You now look like a groom now. -Wow! -The horse is waiting downstairs... -...but the groom is here. -Come on let's go. -Come on let's go! -Come on... -Yes let's go. -This is a big surprise for you. -Let's go down. -You move ahead. -Come on let's go. -You're looking nice. How does this turban look? It's perfect. You look like a groom. How are you? How are you? Oh! Hello! Hello! Oh my! A mare! You have arranged my wedding procession? Thank you. Thank you. Say thank you to your bride. -This is sister-in-law's idea. -Is that so? Come we still have to get you on the horse. Yes. One minute, one minute. Let me go... Move aside move aside... Hey son! Where are you going? That... To patch up! What is that? That means... Mother all this is very common in our generation. Patch up means... Son say something which I can understand. Patch up means the old ties... You will understand in a while. Yes. Listen! Father! Father! Sahil click my snap! #myweddingprocession. Father I wish to tell you... -Father... -Do you wish to sit here? -Come here come... -I don't want to sit. I want to ask you. I want to ask you. What is it? Father when mother took me to uncle's house... What? Your mother forgot to invite your uncle? Oh my God! Father also does not... Silence! What? Oh no! Uncle Tribhuvan lift me up. -Yes. -Come on pick him up! Father, when mother never used to return from uncle's house... -...after your arguments.. -Yes. What did you go and tell her then? I went there on my scooter and told her that... ...relations and scooter do face a problem. At times you need to do servicing. Take this! Come on play the band! Yes come on! Mamma... Mamma please don't cry. Please! My child I will feel sad. First time you are going so far away from me. That's enough now. Stop crying. She is going to Mumbai and not Madagascar. -And listen my child. -Yes. Don't remove your hand out of the window. -Go safely my child. -Yes. My dear atleast let us come to bid you farewell? No I am going. Okay? -Bye! -Okay bye! Why I must have said Madagascar? Oh! Wedding style! Come on hurry up! Hurry up! Be quick! Come on! My child your phone.. I thought you were ignoring but you had forgotten your phone... You go in the other lift. Which is it? Which is your flight? Listen... Harshita! Harshita! Harshita give me two minutes and listen to what I want to say. I only want to say that... Let's go by lift. What I want to say is... Please don't follow me. Okay you wish to walk down? I will carry your bag. But why... Didn't I tell you? Just leave me alone. But why are you walking down with so much weight? I... I will manage. But Harshita I will not be able to manage without you. Harshita today I have come to... you know like... I have come to expose myself in front of you. No I mean not in that way... Where should I begin from? I really don't understand. Harshita I always stood first right from school to college. After I completed my college I realized that... ...the outer world is so different from school and college. And I had this fear what if I fail in this outer world? What will my parents think! What will you think! That means in your heart you decided as to what I will think. -Just once... -Wait a minute. Don't talk I will get confused. What was I saying? Harshita one thing I understood today. I have a fear that I will fail. Let me carry this. But I did not do anything to get over this fear. You have reached till here only because of your courage. Do you remember your first show? You cracked the first joke. No one laughed. Then with courage you cracked the second and then the third... ...then the fourth and the fifth... Harshita! I liked you only because of your courage Harshita. I am such a duffer isn't it? I never learnt anything from you. My male ego has ruined everything. Why you used to love me so much? Tell me. Why? You have always tried to set things right. But I ruined everything in a minute. Harshita! Harshita I am really ashamed of myself. I have treated you very badly. Sorry! I still do not know what I want to do in life. But one thing is definite. No matter how much success I achieve in life... ...but if you are not with me... ...then that will be the greatest failure of my life. This time I will think that I will fail. But before that I wish to try just once. Please! Please give me one chance. Idiot! That's what I have been trying to say. Give yourself a chance to fall. Who told you that you should be perfect? At times you might fail at times I might fail. This relationship will become perfect only with our imperfections. Am I right? Shall I tell you the truth? I was very scared today. In Mumbai if no one laughs at my jokes... ...and if you are not standing in front of me with a glass of water... What would I do then? Let us... Let us... Let's become each other’s again please! Yes! Who has booked an Uber to go to the airport? You called for it? -No! -Even I did not book one. Not us! Wonder from where they send such fake addresses. Come. Carry my bags now. I was telling you that from the fourth floor... -...that I will carry your bags. -My hands... Now I understood what patch up means. Hello Mumbai! How are you? This is Harshita! For the first time I am feeling nice after coming out from Gujarat. And seeing an open bar I am feeling all the more better. Well there are a few differences here and in my city. Your city is known for metro and our city is known for friends! We speak in Gujarati there and here you speak in Marathi. Only when the policeman catches you... Sir please let me go. That's all you need to know to survive in this city. But there is one similarity. Here the names of places change in different languages. In English it is Bandra. In Hindi Bandra... ...and in Marathi Vandre! Same to same in English Ahmedabad. In Hindi Ahamdabad! But in Gujarati I want to go to Amdavad! Well thank you so much both of you for being such a lovely audience. They were not even laughing. They were continuously whispering something to each other. This is a new city. Why do you get so angry? You must gargle from time to time. But why was there no audience? You need to give some time in Mumbai. But I have such a big fan following online! People here know me. Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat... Listen to what I have to say! I have sleepless nights. Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat... Listen to what I have to say! I have sleepless nights. I am very famous in the whole of Gujarat... I am very famous in the whole of Gujarat... Say yes just once and be mine. Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat... Listen to what I have to say! I have sleepless nights. Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat... Listen to what I have to say! I have sleepless nights. I am Mister Singh and you Gujarati queen. -"Is that so? -Our love story is amazing!"
