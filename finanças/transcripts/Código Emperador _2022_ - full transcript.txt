NETFLIX PRESENTS Shut the fuck up! - Stop screaming, bitch! - Shut the fuck up! Hey! What are you doing? Let her go! Son a bitch! Get off me! - Get her out of the car right now! - Motherfucker, mind your fucking business! Hey! - What are you doing?! - Fine, take her! - We gotta go! - Drive. Come on, let's go! You okay? - Yeah. - Yes. Yeah. Careful. Ugh, shit. I can patch you up. Patch me up? At your place? No, my boss's. Are you sure? I don't want to cause you any trouble. Don't worry. Ow! Sorry, I didn't mean to make any noise. It's alright. Nobody's home. Nobody? They're gone for the whole weekend. Hey, so I was thinking. - What? - Maybe you should report what happened. That way, at least the police would come and take a look. Just in case they decide to come back. I can't. I... I don't want to lose this job. Why would you lose your job? My employers are special. They don't want to draw attention. Did you hear that? - What? - I heard a door. Is anyone supposed to come in to work now? They have a cook, but she comes in the morning. Maybe those motherfuckers followed us? Fuck. I'm gonna go take a look, okay? Stay. You stay here. If you hear anything strange, call the police. Understand? Yeah. Hey! Easy. - Sorry. - Don't worry. It's a false alarm, it... it was just a window in the bathroom. Are you okay? Goodbye. Take care. By the way, I'm Ãlex. Wendy. Hey, Wendy. Uh... I'm going to give you my number. And if you ever feel like it, I usually drive by there every day. So maybe I, can um... can give you a ride some other Saturday. Sure. INSTALLED CAMERAS MORALEJA HOUSE PHOTOS ÃNGEL GONZÃLEZ'S PHOTOS So, what do we know about our little Ãngel? I have 20 more important issues and you're still stuck on this shit? But why? He's clean as a whistle. He's been in the party since he was 18 and has never had any problems. He doesn't cause trouble or draw attention. If he's lucky, he'll be on the next ticket to fill space, but chances are, not enough people will vote for him. Come on, Juan. There's got to be someone who knows something. There's always someone who knows something. That one schoolmate who never liked you growing up. That best friend whose life you completely ruined. There's always someone. You know the drill as well as I do. Well, I couldn't find anything so far. Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't go out with women. A bit of porn every now and then, but that's about it. Normal porn? Mm-hmm. So he's really that boring? And his wife? Are you asking me if she watches porn? How are we doing? They came back home. Cameras are working just fine, but we don't have anything yet. By the way, someone called. Hey, Juan. I need to see you. It's urgent. Tomorrow, eight o'clock, usual spot. Athletic wear really suits you. Yeah? Is it turning you on? You already know what turns me on. You have anything good to share with me? That I'm fucked. And that selling an ad page is impossible, Juan. And digital or not, salaries need to be paid. You're the first on my list, you know that. Yeah... The moment I have something good, the scoop is yours, but for right now... "Let's clean up the trash ruining our country, Charo." "Now that there are online publications, company policy is not enough to cover up any kind of corruption." "So go ahead and take the leap." Here I am. I took the leap and I am still in the air waiting for you to decide to give me something serious. Something good. Have I ever given you information that wasn't true? You use me to screw whoever you want in that moment. So why are you talking to me right now? I give you something, you verify it. You check the information. If you think it's good, you go public. If you don't, you tell me to go fuck myself. It's pretty clear. I'm such an idiot, right? I thought you were serious. That you were sick of everything and everyone, and that at some point you wereÂ going to step up and help me tell the truth. The truth? Yes, the truth, Juan. Do you remember? That's a lot. The truth... I can talk to someone and get you some ads for the paper. You're gonna survive. In exchange for what? I want you to keep looking for it. And see if you find it. CLONE TERMINAL UPLOAD PHOTOS - HAPPY FAMILY WEEKEND!! UPLOAD INSTALLED CAMERAS MORALEJA HOUSE And if you take a look here... Chema. Hey, what's happening? I can't hear shit. Well, they may have countermeasures set up in the house. Maybe inhibitors? Something like that, but I think we can amplify it. We're cleaning it now as it's recorded. You'll have three sections tomorrow. Okay. Hurry up. Okay. LOG OUT NEW INCOGNITO TAB YOU HAVE LOGGED OUT WELCOME! MEET NEW PEOPLE LOG IN - SERGIO_93 CHILLING INÂ CÃDIZ! - GalÃ¡n, what's up? - Juan. There's a problem in the Los Altos residential area. The police are already on their way. Los Altos. But that falls under the precinct of... Pozuelo. Azcona. Juan, you son of a bitch. It's been so long... Yeah. Hey, I need you to bail me out of something. Alright. What's up? A call from a house in Los Altos. Do you guys have it? Yeah. I'm almost there. I need you not to go into the house. Have you spoken with anyone inside? I haven't yet. What's this about? I need you to let me go in so I can talk to them. Whoa. Who the fuck do you think you are? You think you can give orders to the police? You may be GalÃ¡n's lapdog now, but that doesn't mean the rest of us need to bend over and kiss your ass. Does it? Do we? I'm asking you as a favor. Well. A favor for a favor? What do you want? - I want to meet with him. - GalÃ¡n? Mm-hmm. - To offer him your services? - To do whatever the fuck I want to do. One phone call. Do we have a deal or not? - Yes? - I'm here on the boss's behalf. Â Hi there. Where is she? She locked herself in the room. And I can't get her to come out. The room's this way. And her cellphone? Uh... I have it. I took it from her, but before I did, she called the cops. That's why I called the boss, because I... I didn't know what to do. But listen to me, I really didn't... I really didn't want to. - I'm sorry. - Okay. I want you to wait in the living room. Don't move, and don't open the door. - Got it? - Yeah, I got it. Branka? Branka, my name is Rodrigo. I'm with the police. It's alright, you can come out. Your husband's not gonna hurt you. Branka, I need you to open the door so that we can help you. Branka? Branka. Yeah. He's here. Huh? Yeah, but... but how the fuck is he gonna do it? Boss, I messed up her fucking face. Oh fuck, I messed up her fucking face. Branka, listen to me. When you're ready, we're both going to leave and head to a hospital. So that a doctor can take a look at you and treat your injuries. I don't want to see him. Don't worry about him, you won't see him. That piece of shit ruined my entire life. Branka, that's not true. - Look at me, for fuck's sake! - Branka, I am looking at you, and I'm telling you that, in a few months, when you look in that mirror, you'll still be the same person you've always been. It's only a matter of time. Nothing has happened yet that we can't fix ourselves. Nothing's happened? Nothing's happened! He's gonna finally rot in jail after what he did to me. I want everybody in the world to know the person that motherfucker really is! And they'll find out, Branka. They'll find out. In a few hours, this will be on every television. - It'll be everywhere. - I'm not scared anymore. Good. That's good. Listen. Is... Is there anything they could use against you? Against me? They could've been following you for months. In case they needed to put pressure on you in a moment like this. No, nothing. I haven't done anything like that. Could it be someone close? Your family? What does my family have to do with any of this? We're talking about a team led by one of the most influential businessmen. He's gonna lose a star player. And on top of that, he's gonna lose a lot of money. But my family isn't in Spain. They all live in Ukraine. This is from six months ago. That's the club's president sitting with the president of Ukraine. There's a contract for the new subway line. - The city of justice in Kiev. - They're going to screw my family. Those motherfuckers! He can't just get away with it after everything he's done. There has to be a way out of this. Yes, there could be. - So? - She won't report it. Yes! Fuck, yeah! Holy shit. That's great. - I'm gonna go talk to her. - No, you can't. Listen to me. The police are waiting outside. There are reporters, too. Are you serious? - How did they find out? - I don't know. They can't see her face. But she needs to go to a hospital now. So what we're gonna do is come up with a story that everyone is gonna believe. - That's perfect, what story? - A robbery. Lately, the homes of several soccer players have been robbed. But in this case, it will be a considerably violent robbery. After they assaulted the owners, they opened the safe and disappeared. That story's not gonna work. Why's that? Because I'm not hurt. That's the buyer. We've identified him as GÃ¼nter Schull. He's German. He's been linked to white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups. Do we know what they're trying to sell? We need to find a way to access that laptop. Wendy. - Hello, Ãlex. - Hi there. Need a ride? Oh, don't worry. The bus will be here any minute. Come on, get in the car. We'll give your friends something to talk about. Wendy, is that your boyfriend? I'm going with him. Introduce him to us. Â All right, go on, take care! Bye-bye! So you have... - Six sisters. - Six. And I'm the seventh. So, all girls and all working across Europe. Yes. We are all saving money to build a house. In the Philippines. Build a house? So you can all live together? Well, to live and work. We have already bought the land. We're going to build a three-story house with guest rooms for tourists. And there's gonna be a view of the sea. And marriage? Do you think you would still live with them even if you were married? Hmm, no... I... don't know. Yeah. You're right. Why complicate things in life? Give me 15 minutes, okay? That was fast! It's very late. I should go back now. I'll drive you. There's no need. I'll take the bus. No, really, I don't mind. Plus, I'd know you're safe. Okay. The other day, in the house, something immediately caught my eye. What? It was about your room. There was nothing of yours. Nothing personal. 'Cause it's not my room. I just live there. That's why I don't have many things. It makes things much easier when I have to switch houses. Everything's in a suitcase? There it is. What do you think? Well, either those shoes are really expensive, or there's something behind it. You went a little too far, huh? - You think? - A couple of blows is fine, but this... Fernando will be out at least three or four games. The boss is very upset. Better thanÂ losing everything, right? It pisses you off having to do this kind of thing. - You don't understand. - I understand, but I don't like it. - We have to take care of our friends. - Whose friends are those? - A favor we do today... - Can be tomorrow's key, I know that. And thanks to your efforts, millions of Spaniards can continue to enjoy the best soccer league in the world. You should be happy. So... Are there any updates on our favorite politician? Nothing much. Hmm, nothing much is something. He has a fake profile on social media. Hmm. Sounds very promising. Don't get your hopes up. I thought I'd found something, but I checked everything and there's nothing serious. So why did he do it? I guess he wanted to chat without anyone knowing he's a politician. To chat about what? Just movies, TV shows, music stuff, sharing videos... Of kittens? Of extreme sports. And people getting weird tattoos. Things like that. Seriously? - I don't buy it. - GalÃ¡n, there's nothing. He's just pretending to be anonymous. THE SHOES ARE MOVING Something's come up. I have to go. Juan. Every person has some desire. Go find his. Give it to him, and then you record it. Just like that. "Just like that." Any problem? Well, it's one thing to look for shit, and another to throw it at him. If he's the saint you say he is, he should keep clear of it. Don't you think? Come on, Juan. Don't let me down, okay? It would be the first time. Fucking A', now we're in. Not even a phone call or a message in seven days. Be honest with me. If I hadn't shown up, would you even have bothered to call me? No. I don't think so. I prefer for things to happen when they're supposed to happen. They just left the house. Go ahead. OPEN FROM EXTERNAL DEVICE RECENT ITEMS What? Nothing. Nothing? This is weird, isn't it? Yeah, I mean. Look at you. And now look at me. We couldn't be any more different. Yes. And? Nothing. Cobalt-60. It's used in the industry to measure the thickness of metals and plastics. It's also used in medical facilities to sterilize materials. And make bombs. If you connect a conventional bomb to a piece of Cobalt-60, even 11 inches, you'll contaminate a whole city. It comes from Argentina, from an abandoned military hospital. Some high-ranking generals are getting big money selling it on the black market. So neo-Nazi terrorists are planning to buy a dirty bomb. They may hand it over here or directly in Germany. We should warn them, and give all this intel to the BND. - I think they'll smuggle it through Spain. - Why is that? There's an e-mail account. It was deleted after sending it. There's evidence they're in touch with a network that's been smuggling coke in Europe. Their supply comes from many countries, including Argentina. And I'm pretty sure they'll be using one of their routes. Okay. We need to find out where they plan to smuggle the goods here. Check and see if we know somebody who works with them too. LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kurucz? Possibly. Check it out. Chema, I need you to set up something important. A fake profile. A young girl. Nineteen. You can use these photos. This isn't enough for a profile. For this to work, I need to make up at least six months of activity. Well, there's plenty on her webpage. I'll send you the link. Name? Sara. SEE ALL PICTURES WENDY'S PHOTOS SARA: YOU HAVE ONE NEW NOTIFICATION SERGIO_93 LIKES YOUR PHOTO SERGIO_93 LIKES YOUR PHOTO 1 REQUEST: SERGIO_93 WANTS TO FOLLOW YOU IGNORE - ACCEPT SERGIO_93: HI SARA: HI DO I KNOW YOU? TYPING... NO, BUT... YOU'VE GIVEN ME SO MANY LIKES YOU POST COOL THINGS YOUR PHOTOS ARE VERY NICE TOO "VERY NICE" SO POLITE!!! HAHAHA! ALWAYS HAHAHA!!! WELL HEY, GOTTA GO Beer... or you guys call it, Calimocho. I tried this mix at losÂ Sanfermines. Have you ever been there? Never. Ah! Los Sanfermines, la Semana Grande, Carnaval de Tenerife... You guys in Spain really know how to party. Is that why you like to do business over there? I like to do business whatever the treat, man. - It's a mutual respect, you know. - Well... Last time you went over, things weren't that smooth, right? I've heard you had a little problem with the Guardia Civil. They confiscated 50 kilos of coke from you, right? This is the nature of our business. But, you just came here all over to give me this bullshit? No. I'm here to give you back what belongs to you. The 50 kilos. You mean, the police, or as you guys call them, the picoletos, are just going to give me back my precious cocaine with some note saying: "We are sorry"? Not exactly. I'll get it for you. I have some friends there, and I know where they burn it. So, I'll get the stuff and drop it off wherever you want. In a one by one exchange, for your information. Yeah. This info you're after must be really important for you, huh? Do you know these guys? Yeah? I found out where they smuggle the goods through. - It'll be through Bilbao's harbor. - Awesome. Hey, I'll call you back. - I'm with my mom right now, okay? - Okay, bye. See ya. Marta! - Oh, hey. - How are you? - Fine. You? - Fine. So you come here now? No, I work here. Uh... Is that a problem? - No, not at all. - No? Ah, okay. Or is it? Hmm, no. I mean,Â rent, textbooks and college don't pay for themselves, do they? Your father doesn't help you with that? I don't give a shit about him. I get by on my own. Yes, I can see that. Look, dude, there's nothing wrong with this gig. People want to spend money like crazy and we help them do it. - Anything wrong with that? - No, nothing. Until one of them wants something, more than just have a drink with you. We have security here. Don't worry about it. And besides, look. Over there. That guy with the tie on his head is a... District council member. Yep... Why bother telling you about these people when you know them better than I do, Juan? That's why I'm telling you to be careful. Oh, thank you. It'll be easy. The camera is not gonna be working, and the patrol assigned to the site will be making a long round so they can watch the opposite side. You're the fucking man! Fifty kilos need to be delivered to La Jonquera, okay? There's the address. The rest of it is for you. No shit! You're the fucking man, Juan. Hey, stay and have a drink with the boys. - Another day, Arturito. - Just one drink with us, man. - Another day. - Alright. WENDY NEW MESSAGE YOU DON'T LIKE MOVIES ANYMORE? ÃLEX ONE NEW MESSAGE I HATE THE TRAILERS That is why I prefer to come in when the movie's about to start. I should've said something about me being out of town for work. You don't need to do that. But I want to. I'm not used to having to depend on anyone. But here you are. Yeah, here I am. Aren't you at least a little curious to learn more about me? I just keep on interrogating you, and you... Okay, what's your job? What? There's no need. Yes! Tell me what you do. I'm curious. I work as a detective. For an insurance company. I investigateÂ robberies, arson, accidents... And do you like what you do? Well, someone has to do it, right? SERGIO_93 YOU NEVER SLEEP? SARA: JUST GOT HOME. YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING ONLINE THIS LATE? TELL ME. WHAT DID YOU DO TONIGHT? SHALL WE VIDEO CALL? DO I SCARE YOU? REALLY? WHY DON'T WE MEET? BUT IN PERSON? DO I SCARE YOU? A BIT, BUT OKAY. TOMORROW? I'M BUSY THIS WEEK, BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW SOON. OKAY, WHENEVER BILBAO HARBOR Okay, copy. He's out of the crane's cabin, okay? He's leaving work early. Come on. Let's go. He's on the dock. He's heading for the parking lot. Go... Come on, you can start assembling now. Go. Shit, it's not here. I'm about to lose eyes. He'll show up any minute. - You gotta go. - Come on. Get out of there! Get out... What the hell happened here? Try his locker, he may have left it. They just searched it. There's nothing in there or in the cabin of the crane. - He didn't cross paths with anyone today? - Maybe LÃ¡szlÃ³'s intel wasn't good. That can't be it. No, LÃ¡szlÃ³ wouldn't lie about the Germans getting a sample today. He doesn't have a reason to fuck with us. They might have changed their minds. We have to go over everything from the beginning. Look, I'm okay with that, but no one has come close to the car or crossed paths with him between the moment he checked in, and the moment he left. Maybe it's there. - Where? - At the security checkpoint. We have his entry and exit on tape, right? Yeah, we have that, but... Let's see. Okay, pause it. Zoom in. Press play. Wait for it. Stop it. There. What's that? It's a car key. Son of a bitch... It's him. It's GÃ¼nter Schull. And the man with him is probably the one who's analyzing the sample. If everything's fine, they'll get in touch again for the delivery. So the intel was good. Now we know how they're transporting it. Oh, shit! Shit, come on. Pick up the phone. I gotta go, Rebecca. I'll see you later. So what? Are you going to nag me about the nightclub again? No, I'm not here to nag you. - No? - I need to ask you for a favor. - Yeah. - Is Juan with you? I don't know where he is. He's not picking up his phone. - Something wrong? - We really fucked up. The maid just found one of the cameras. Are you seriously out of your fucking mind or what? I am not a whore. If I thought some cheap whore could do it, I'd ask one, but I need you for this. Why's that? Because you're exactly the kind of girl that guy wants to meet. - Ah. - You'd just have to change how you look. Go fuck yourself. Marta. Marta! Marta, listen to me. - Marta! - You know I was sick. How could you? I was only 15 and I was addicted to drugs. And I helped you out. - You promisedÂ no one would see the video. - And no one ever has. But you still have it. They wanted to sell it to a magazine, but I stopped it. You kept it so you could screw me whenever the fuck you wanted to. Marta, listen to me. How dare you blackmail me I'm asking you for a favor. Like hell you are. Like hell you are! If I don't go on this date, you'll leak it and let everybody watch it and they'll see the daughter of the most famous actor blowing a fucking drug dealer for a shot of heroin! That's not gonna happen. It doesn't have to happen. - Do we know what she's saying? - We don't have bugs in there. - She didn't go to the garden. - So what if she didn't? She could've gone outside to tell her employers, but she didn't. Just because she hasn't done it yet, doesn't mean anything. We have to get her out of there. If the girl disappears, they could become suspicious and we don't want any changes in the house now. Whether we want it or not, there's been a change in the house. She knows we're watching. Wendy. You're leaving? Can I talk to you? - Wendy, listen to me. - Ãlex, leave me alone, please. I wish I could explain everything to you, but I can't right now. I don't need an explanation. But I really need you to stay here. I'm in the middle of something important. Please, you have to trust me. Trust you? I know I can't ask you that. I know it's hard. Why did you come back? When we met, you tricked me to get in here. Why come back after that? Because I wanted to be with you. You told me you didn't want to hurt me. It's the last thing I could possibly want to do. - This thing between us is real. - So that is real? Wendy, I understand you don't want to see me ever again, I understand you feel betrayed, but I need you to listen for a second. You're leaving without telling your employers because you found out they aren't as good as they seem. You want to disappear and avoid trouble, but they are not going to let anyone compromise what they are working on. And I assure you, Wendy, that they will find you. And they will take you out. Not just you, but anyone who stands in their way. You know I'm telling the truth. She isn't gonna say anything. Why should we believe her? Because she won't, damn it. If I wasn't sure about that, she'd already be stuck in that trunk. Are we clear? - Yeah, we're clear. - Good, so stop fucking around with me. Where is he? There. SERGIO_93 ARE YOU UPSTAIRS? SARA YES, I DON'T SEE YOU THERE'S A PRIVATE AREA. SEE IT? SERIOUSLY? VIP AREA:-0 COME Hi there. RED LEATHER TOP? GETTING WARMER... I think you have something to tell me. It looks like you might have something to tell me too, right? Hello, Sara. Sergio. So? How'd it go? Fine. I don't know. I was a bit mean at first, because of the photo thing. And he said I had done the same thing, so we laughed. And, from there,Â he took me to his room. All of a sudden, he pushed me against the closet and started to fuck me there. Can you believe that? I mean, he didn't seem like the type of guy. What? Excuse me, didn't you want him wrapped around my finger? Will you tell me what went down or not? The thing is that you could have put a wiretap on me - and you'd already know everything by now. - Well, I could've. Yeah. But you didn't because, you know, deep down you weren't so sure I wouldn't end up naked in a room with him. You can admit it. He wouldn't on the first date. He's not like that. Oh. Right. Well, and? I told him what you told me to. That I don't trust anyone because I had trouble getting rid of a couple of problematic guys that wouldn't leave me, that's why I have a fake profile. And him? He said his photos are fake, but that he was being honest. That he's a lawyer,Â and that's why he has to keep up appearances. A lawyer. Well, it's true, he did study Law. And so I saidÂ that it's fine, that I'm not even angry, hmm, but that he's just not what I'm looking for. - That we can still be friends. - And you could stay in touch. - Yeah, getting to know each other. - Good. Good. - I don't know. - What? He was like,Â really nervous. I think it's the first time he's done something like this. He could disappear. Well, we'll know soon enough. - Yeah. - The goods are already on their way. - What? - The woman just talked to GÃ¼nter Schull to tell him that the cobalt has already left Argentina. It'll arrive in Bilbao in days. We need the name of the ship. We can't get caught off guard. Tell Chema not to miss anything. I need people listening in 24/7. Everything. I can't leave Spain now. This is very serious, Juan. I wouldn't turn to you if it wasn't. - I know you're overwhelmed. - I'm not dropping any operation for this. We're only talking about two days. Maybe three tops. Okay, look. Here's what I'll do for you. Do this favor for me and I'll get the politician out of your hair. What? Isn't that what you want? I've shown him the bait. I'm waiting. Well, we can pass it on to Azcona. - Azcona? He's with us now? - I know you aren't fond of him, but he's got the right attitude and at least he's not as picky as you are. - Then why not send him to Panama? - No, he's way too green. Besides, they only want you. And so do I. I wouldn't trust anyone else for this. Two days. Three days tops. I'll stick with the Ãngel GonzÃ¡lez thing. It's not a good idea to change now. Fantastic, it's your call. Do we know what the Panamanians want? I can't go empty-handed. Don't worry, you're not going empty-handed. PANAMA CITY Naranjo? Oh, fuck! How are you, my man? Whatever happened to my friend from Madrid, huh? Who would even recognize you? Sit down. - Come, take a seat. - Somehow you haven't changed one bit. The upside of being ugly from a young age. It can't get worse than that, right? Uh, Delia. Give me another one, please. Want anything? Uh... same as him. How many years has it been since you left Spain? Five? Time really does fly. I miss the nights in Madrid. - Ah yes, life in Madrid. - Yeah. So, what are you going to do about this guy? Well, we'll have to find some arrangement. Good. We've been holding him in his room. Two days have passed and it hasn't goneÂ public yet. And we're all grateful for that. Look. This is the kid. A guy whoÂ was dealingÂ marijuana. Small-time. Apparently, your man and the kid met at a bar. They had a couple of drinks and well, they went to a hotel. Hey. Is it trueÂ that this friend of yours decides the life and freedom of people? - He's well regarded. - Fuck! Well, if that's how they make decisions in the Supreme Court, then I pity you poor Spaniards. Here are both your cocktails. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Look. The family doesn't know the details. They know thatÂ Enrique's dead. They knew he suffered from seizures since he was a kid, and his family was told that was the cause of death. He had a seizure and fell off a balcony. So now, well, if you guys want us to help, you'll have to compensate the family. And you'll have to pay us too. Don't worry, there's enough for everyone. Money? Stop fucking with me, brother. Come on. That'll be great for the family. But what about us? Juan, do you really think we need your money? There you have it. One of Panama's biggest bankers, having fun with a male prostitute in Madrid's Chueca district. Is this enough compensation? - Take care. - Safe travels. And don't get yourself into more trouble, Your Honor. Thank you. - When we arrive in Madrid... - Nobody knows anything. - But my wife must've been told... - An issue with the visas. Just a diplomatic incident. Diplomatic incident, sure. A setup. That's what it was. As soon as I finished my lecture, they took me to the airport. Suddenly, the plane is malfunctioning and I'm staying the night. You don't have to give me an explanation. I did not pay for that boy to service me sexually! Then why was he in your room? He was a fucking drug dealer! The flight's cancelled, he's in the bar. He comes to my room and starts to snort lines of cocaine! Wait, that's it. What? Was this your guys' doing? Did the Agency stage all this? It's that shit, isn't it? What do you guys call it? Robes control, right? First you screw me and then you come to the rescue? You wanted me on a leash, like Remesana and Escudero, but since you couldn't find anything... You have been on my back for six months. This ends here! As soon as I get to Madrid, I'll investigate the truth about who invited me to come here all expenses paid. And if I find out that you people are involved in this fiasco... This man had an epileptic seizure, and you, Your Honor, who thought he was about to die, didn't want him to be found in your room so you had the idea to throw him off the balcony. Who the fuck do you think could stage something like that, you piece of shit? We need to go right now. - The goods already got to the harbor. - Wait, when? - Earlier today. - Let's go. The building is under the control of local dealers. The goods are there, waiting to be handed over to GÃ¼nter Schull's people. Do we know when it's being delivered? Today, tomorrow, we don't know. If we set up an operation with the police... No, we can't wait for them. These places are impossible to raid. They're all connected to one another. Before we get with the police, they can take it out through a hundred backyards. No, if it's there, we have to go now. It's going to be very hard to get in without turning any heads. There's no way I'm letting it leave the building. Hi, guys.Â You want some coke, or ecstasy? Or some pills,Â speed? Nothing? Hi there. You want some cocaine? Some Molly? Some speed? - You've got some speed? - Speed? Yeah, follow me. It's here. Go to the third floor. Ah! What do you want? We wanted to buy some speed. Okay. Get in. One more time. Â Come on, brother, I just finished that one. Wouldn't you like some cabbage rolls? My aunt LenuÅ£a, she used to make great cabbage rolls... Come on! Ana, they saw him! Go down the hall on your left and into the kitchen. There's a hole in the wall, go through it. Come on, Ana. Go, come on! This is Agent 80-32. We need backup. Freeze! Hands up! Let him go! Now! Are you okay? That's impossible. - Police! Hands up! - On the ground, now! On the ground! Freeze! Don't move! Heads on head! SERGIO_93 LIKES YOUR PHOTO SARA - HEY! THE GHOST LOT OF WORK YOU HAVEN'T SENT ME ONE SINGLE LIKE IN AGES Hey, I mean... No, I'm sick of it. I'm just sick of everything having to do with him. DO YOU NOT LIKE ME ANYMORE? NOT AT ALL. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TOO ACTIVE YOURSELF. TRYING TO GET BY. WORK IS AWFUL. IF YOU NEED A PHILOLOGIST WITH EXPERIENCE IN BARS... HAVING DRINKS? HAHAHAHA, NO, STUPID! AS A WAITRESS!! BUT IF YOU BUY ME A DRINK... CONSIDER IT DONE WHEN? AS SOON AS I HAVE TIME FRIDAY? AWAY. WORK TRIP. TALK TO YOU LATER.Â XOXO Wendy. Can we talk for a minute? - What happened to you? - Nothing. Don't go back to the house. There are police there, they might think you have something to do with them. Is it over? Yes. They won't be a danger to anyone, including you. Thank you for letting me know. Hey, you have someplace to stay? I can call a friend of mine. Wendy. I'm guessing this is the last thing you'd want, but you can stay at my place. Until you find something. You can sleep on my bed, or there, on the sofa bed. Whatever you prefer. Right here is fine. Thank you. You don't have that many things in here. No. Everything in a suitcase. Just like you. It's easier like this, right? One day you open the door and just disappear. Well, I wish that were enough. But it's hard to not leave a trail. I'm sure you'd still know how to do it if you wanted to. We could try together. What do you say we disappear? I'm serious, Wendy. I know a place where no one would ever find us. Good evening, everyone. Top Sports Magazine is all dressed up for one of the biggest events of the year. A major event not only for sports, but for representatives of culture, politics and business in this country. A red carpet that is already full of public figures, who are we gonna see? Â Fernando, how are you? Smile for us. Everything's alright. We'll be there, so don't you worry one bit, okay? I have to go. Enjoy the galaÂ and best of luck. Thank you. You won't believe it until you go to Panama. Your Honor. Goodness. Ãngel. What are you doing here? They're inviting you to these parties now? Yes, sir, I'm on the Culture and Sports Commission, so... - Paying the price. - Something like that. Hey, let me introduce you to my wife. Alicia. - Ãngel GonzÃ¡lez. - A pleasure. A dedicated student and now a congressman, hmm? A dedicated student? Well, lousy exams, but very good term papers. That's something. - Yes. - And your wife? She didn't come? - Couldn't make it. Our kid got sick, so... - Oh, I'm sorry to hear. - Thanks. - Did I overhear something about a party? Excuse me for a second. The lawyer part was true. Well... I got my degree. Sara... Listen to me... Who are you? Someone who wants to know you. Yeah. I mean, I know I'm not doing things right, but... I can't just go around telling everyone right off the bat I'm a politician, that... - that I'm a Congressman. - Why didn't you tell me you are married? Don't know. I don't know. I guess I didn't want to complicate... things. I'm sorry. Wait. I'm not mad at you. Really? I understand. We all have our secrets. And I don't like to be judged, so I won't judge you. - I have to go back,Â hm? - Oh, yeah,Â me too. But if you want,Â I mean... we canÂ meet at some other time, some other place... I mean,Â if you want. - I'm hitting the road to Madrid after. - I'm not. No? I have a hotel room. Here, I mean in,Â in... Oh, yeah? Yeah, I go back tomorrow. Don't worry. I just came back from the gala. Yeah, it was fine. Remember the Judge? I ran into him tonight. No, tomorrow I'll be getting up early and I'll be on time for Nacho's game. Yeah. Y-yeah. One second. Hey! Wa... I'll call you later. Hold on! Police. Can I come in? - Come in. - Yeah, I'm with him. Uh-huh. Yeah, of course. Sounds good, we'll talk later. The girl's sticking to her side of the story. - She wants to press charges. - B-but, w-what charges? She came here willingly, of her own accord. Hmm... I see. She told me you forced her. She tried to push you away, but couldn't make you stop until it was over. That's a lie. That's a lie, I swear. She is lying. I didn't do anything to that girl. But you admit to having sex with her. Yes... we had sex after she consented. - She consented? - Yes, I told you. She consented, and she's on her way to the hospital with an officer? No, okay. No, listen to me. She was fine when she went to the bathroom. She was fine. She went in, and when she came out, she was bleeding a lot, and she went for the door. I swear, that's it! Do any drugs? No. Of course we didn't. There's cocaine in the bathroom. What? But... I don't get it. This can't be. I mean, I have absolutely nothing to do with the cocaine. I swear.Â I haveÂ nothing to do with it! According to your side of things, you had sex, so when she's examined in the hospital and they decide... Yes. We had sex, but I promise nothing more. Nothing more. I didn't do anything she didn't want me to. To a minor? Wha-What do you mean, a minor? No, she's not a minor. No, Sara's 19 years old. - Sara told me that she was 19 years old. - Is that her purse? Yes. I think so. Listen, listen to me. I... I-I give you my word, that she told me she was of legal age. - She looked of legal age. - She looked like it... - Son of a bitch. - ...but she isn't. She'll be a minor for another six months. No... Look, no. I-I can show you, No, I don't think you can. Yes. I have her text messages, where she said she was 19. I mean... That's it. Look at it, please. Look at that. There it is. That's not her name. No, but it's her. - It's a fake profile, but it's her. - Calm down, sir. You'll see that it's her profile. Who's this? "Sergio_93"? That's me. I-I also went online with a fake profile for precaution, do you understand? I don't understand any of this. Please identify- - I need your help... - You listen to me. I am asking you to identify yourself. If you don't want to show me your ID, we'll go to the station and continue. Wait, are you...? Are you Ãngel GonzÃ¡lez, the congressman? Yes. Hence, the fake profile. I... I wanted to avoid... Forget it. It doesn't matter. Ãngel, Tell me the truth... I'm not saying anything until I have a lawyer present. I'm sorry. Ãngel, listen to me. Do you think that someone might've set you up? Of course I do, man. It's obvious. A girl like her, coming out of nowhere... I-I-I've been such an idiot... An asshole... - Who do you think could've done that? - I really don't know. - I don't know. - Anyone from the party? No... no one. Think carefully, Ãngel. This kind of thing usually comes from the people closest to you. I-I-I... don't have enemies. You very clearly do. Nobody would go through all this trouble for nothing. There must be a reason. - Someone considers you dangerous. - But I... - That you're a threat. - No... I probably won't get on the ballot, why would someone want to get me out of their way?Â Oh, God. Maybe you know something... Know something? Yes, sensitive information about someone influential that you may have come across and that they want to neutralize. But wha-wha... what information? I don't know. Someone delivering a bribe. No. A meeting with a judge that shouldn't be happening. You know. I don't know what you're talking about. Ãngel, you have to focus. There has to be something. No! Information that someone let slip after a meeting. On a break... There's none of that. I assure you. Something to endanger a reputation. Think carefully and don't lie! You have to work with me, you have to trust me. - But I'm telling you... - We have to get to the bottom of this! I'm telling you the truth! - There has to be something! - I am telling you the truth, goddamn it! I am telling you the truth! I don't have any information on anything or anyone. I have nothing! Nothing! I don't... You have to believe me, please. Believe me. Yeah. So it was all the girl, for your money. That's it. It's over. It's over, that's it. It's the end. No. Not necessarily. It doesn't have to be over. You can make her an offer and see how she responds. That way, we'll at least know if she's really the one behind this. Marta? - Where is Marta? - What the fuck's wrong with you, dude? Hey, man. You can't come in! Get out. I said, get out! What the fuck are you doing? - You came here for your stuff. - Yeah. Okay, it's in there. In the closet. Smashed to pieces. They say it's safest that way. Don't you feel sick? When I saw you in that room, talking to him in the same tone, with the same fucking words. With the same fucking lies. Don't you make yourself sick? I wanted to throw up so badly, that I actually did. Yeah, get the fuck out, that's right! Fuck you, man! You hear me? Fuck you! You can leak whatever you want! But if you want to screw that guy, I won't fuck him, it'll be you! You hear me?! COPY VIDEOS - PASTE COPYING FILES EMPEROR Eight letters... Basque Country.Â Colloquialism referring to a law enforcement officer. Txakurra. - A "K?" - T, X, and K. Oh, that's right. Txakurra. Hey. Wonderful job in Bilbao. There's still a lot of work to do. The sellers and the cell in Germany, we have to go after them. I'll head there in a few days. And what about Ãngel? Nothing. Ultimately, it didn't work out. I put the bait out in front of him, but he didn't go for it. He freaked out. At the last second, he pulled his pants up and left. Well, he's got everything. He's a bore and a coward. But I can confirm he's pretty much out of the game. Management of the party doesn't want him. They need room for their people, and Ãngel GonzÃ¡lez, as of now, has no supporters in the party. So we've been wasting our time with him. I don't know, I can try something else if you want. No, if you're sure about it, then I see no reason to continue our efforts. Shitty luck. Wendy? That's good. Alright. Nah, I'll call you back. - Hey, Juan. How is... - Where is she? What the fuck are you doing? She did nothing. She has nothing to do with the case. That's up to the judge to decide. She was only working in the house. I have the information. It seems to me that might be the problem. You need to tell me what you know. What did GalÃ¡n promise you? You're making a fool out of yourself, Juan. You know that, right? As soon as I get her a lawyer, you'll have to let her go. You have nothing. Nothing. Did you know that your lady friend not only keeps bad company, but also doesn't have a work permit? Yeah, hot shot. That's right. So behave yourself. Cause if you don't, I'll see to it personally that the Filipino girl you're fucking is deported to her shithole of a country. Is that clear? And do as you're fucking told once and for all. Well, well. The prodigal son has finally returned. I need to see you. Tomorrow at 8:00, as usual? No, right now. I'm outside your office. What's with the hurry? This isn't the best time for this, so if you came to talk about... Charo, I want you to have this. The information is encrypted. You'll get the code to unlock what's there in four hours unless I stop it beforehand. If you want me to publish it, why would you stop it? Because I'm not sure you should publish it. Right. So, you're using me as your contingency plan. So that they can't fuck you over, is that it? You're right, if this all goes south, they're really gonna fuck me over. But you'll have the exclusive you were looking for in there. How do you like that deal? But I don't want you to... If that time comes, be very careful. No one can know what you're gonna do. If they know, they'll stop you. Okay, let's think this through. There must be another way. Let's do this right, Juan. There's no more thinking left, Charo. It is what it is. But why me? You're the first one on my list. I've always told you that. I've always worked hard. Can we talk? Yeah, sure. Sorry. Oof, those old geezers were driving me fucking crazy. Especially Manchado, now he's been pro... How long have you been following me? No family. No romantic relationships at all. Not even bad habits. Too much control. Sooner or later,Â shit had to hit the fan somewhere. And eventually, yeah. It did. That woman has you whipped. Now you have something to fuck me over with, right? No one wants to fuck you over, Juan. No one. We just want to be able to trust you. Like we trust Ãngel GonzÃ¡lez. I told you we set him up. He's still clean. In the end, people who are that clean turn out to be the most dangerous. There's nothing more unpredictable than a politician with nothing to hide. When they're given a little power, they become corrosive, and start having their own ideologies. Some even insist on doing what they promised. Like looking under the rug, and cleaning things up. That would be the end. - Only for us. - For everyone, Juan. For everyone. We live in a carefully balanced world. Made of a very delicate fabric woven over many years, and if someone insists on pulling the thread, oh. Anyway, since you worry so much about our friend, you no longer have to. Things will look bright for him from now on. Very bright. His profile is a match for the cleanup that the voters have been crying out for. We have certainty that no one will find anything about him, beyond that slip. Hey, I have to go, they're giving me this goddam medal soon. So, unless you brought me any presents... She has to stay clean. She's clean. - She won't be deported. - She won't be deported. Juan, how about we forget about this whole thing? What do you think? Like it never happened. Come on, we need you, goddamn it. There's so much work ahead of us. Alright, listen, I have to go,Â huh? POLICE Are you alright? Yes... I am now. I'm sorry. What's this? This envelope has everything you're gonna need. There's only one ticket. And you? I still have things I need to settle here. I want to ask you something. Is your name Ãlex? Juan. Abaday. That's my name. The agency said it didn't sound Filipino and that I should choose something more...Â normal. Abaday. There'll be a guest house right by the sea. Managed by seven sisters. I'll be there. SENDING RECEIVING CODES RECEIVING CODES After the unexpected resignation of the leader of the main oppositional party, at this moment we can confirm that the new Secretary General will be Hernando Lara, who until now was in charge of Social Affairs. Among the new faces of what will be the heart of power in the new leadership... - Ring me up, please. - ...the following are confirmed: Marisol Zamarrejo, Julio Zapico and as a last-minute surprise, Ãngel GonzÃ¡lez, who will lead coordination of the parliamentary caucus until the next election cycle. First, I have to say,Â it's a real honor to be able to serve this party. I accept this position withÂ humility. And also with a sense of responsibility, and of course, I hope to meet the expectations of my party... And of my country, as I wouldn't have it any other way.
