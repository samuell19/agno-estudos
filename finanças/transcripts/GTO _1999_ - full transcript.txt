I came to check - To check? I want to make sure you never approach the kids at Meishu School again Meishu School is going to be completely restructured I don't want a bad influence to spread chaos among them calling the students "buddy" and all I know you performed the "good teacher" act but the students have nothing to gain with such teacher It may look like fun with a touch of irresponsibility but the fake energetic method is only harmful If you come close to the class 2-4 again I'll have them all expelled Why involve them? They are all trouble makers If I expelled them all no one would bother comment if you care about them you'll obey me I had no plan to approach them anyway Good thinking teacher Onizuka Good that you can ponder and understand This is for the both of us Hey you, your change - I don't need the change What was that? - That one Eikichi you're OK with her? You let her get away with that What can I do I'm not even a teacher anymore Eikichi Because of a recent series of misconducts We are more and more losing the trust of the parents I'm going to restore the good name of this school and its prestige to this purpose I will absolutely require your professional cooperation To start with the restructuration we'll build a communication network between students and professors we'll share the latest information The aim being to bring the educational site to life Now we introduce a point system for the salaries of teachers A point system? - Depending on your performance Your salaries will fluctuates It is a simple, straightforward system Here the detailed assessment criteria -Guidance to students who have an illicit sexual relations, +30 -When a delinquent is straightened, +80 -Extracurricular activity, winner nationwide, +50 -For each student taken to University level, +30 When a student's average score increases +1? ... +5 points?

Since that Headmaster is here a lot is changing At last we may start to look like a real school Kikuchi? Don't run down the hallway - I'm sorry 1 point added Hey Please adjust your necktie - I'm sorry Great All the teachers are striving for their salary They're all absorbed in their tablets Let's hope they don't turn strange With the newly installed surveillance cameras we can monitor the behavior other teachers and students The content of the mail exchange on the tablets the sites they visit the location of each one via GPS This school is in my control Nothing good can come out of such methods Excessive educational management kills the good will of teachers Who stole it then? I didn't do it Why didn't you tell me? I thought if I told the truth it would affect my aptitude assessment They all assume that and hide What's going on in classes For the sake of the assessment people lose their sense of right and wrong Don't be simplistic By introducing an education based on sentiments you think this country improved? The decline of academic standards The lack of competitive motivation Selfish assertiveness People lose faith in the future All due to that "humane" teaching As for me I'm going to straighten back these "humane" teaching fed students and take this establishment to the top in the country and in doing so I'll show you a school works exactly like a business I won't let you dispose of it as you please Your disappointing management is over I'm in charge now It's great to have that new Headmaster - It's so cool they gave us the tablet Really - It's educational They're truly taking to the methods of the Headmaster Isn't going too far? She's striving for popularity Well When Onizuka was here without the toy it was fun every day It freaks me out that they can be bought with such a bauble This is not enough to make things better Exactly Are you going home? I'm going back - Listen, Kusano ... here for you Sank you You saw that? Like his wife - What? You don't have to be so secretive - You tell us Dis Game'u iz a Japanese fair Yu knou? - Yes, I know Ok... Ready Go It's Gold finger Dam 'it God Damn You lost $5 Teacher Onizuka Teacher Fuyutsuki It has changed that much It's another school all together Teacher Onizuka Can't you come back? It if you leave it like this It feels that something is irreversible If you were with us ... - If it's the way they want it Isn't better so? They can watch erotic movies with their tablets right? I want one too Teacher Onizuka ... What are you saying? - They're great with busty girls or girls in uniforms Or young female teachers like you are great The sex dream of school boys It's enough Fuyutsuki-chan Kikuchi Are you monitoring the students? Yeah, that's right It's not your job You can't stop me This is how I take my revenge on you In order to put your educational theories in practice my mother sacrificed a lot because of that my family exploded my parents divorced My mother left and abandoned me Your mother? Because of you, I lost what was most precious to me And in return I want to take some precious from you This school Nice training - Thank you Soon you'll get in the ring, Kusano keep working hard all eyes are on you You did good [Call from: Mayuko Asano] Hello Are you Tadaaki Kusano? I am Mayuko's mother Her mom? I want you to stop seeing Mayuko from now on You're not even entering college You want to be a boxer? [Information on the anonymous letter] I can't agree with that she can't see a person like you You know I'm not particularly "seeing" her In any case, please don't try to meet her again My precious daughter is not going to hang out with a hooligan Hey, wait a minute Hello? Why? Hello ... Who ordered two rice omelets? Teacher Kusano ... I didn't know you practiced boxing Hey, what's the matter? Your old man was a boxer too? But he wasn't too strong He was used to give confidence to young rookies But I used to like the way he was standing in the ring I want to be a boxer and when I become a champion That man who raised me on his own I want to achieve his dream But ... Asano's parents don't seem to agree with this She can date only a guy who goes to college Can't I pursue my dream? Am I not taking good care of the future? And now I'm going to lose Mayu-chan Teacher help me "If you care for them you will obey me" Teacher? What's wrong with you? You never refused to help one of us The circumstances are not favorable Teacher Kusano, I'm sorry I don't have any power In accordance with the provision of Article 43 of Meishu school rules The following student is suspended from school Kusano, what did you do? I didn't do anything Why is Kusano suspended? Kusano has been relentlessly harassing Ms. Asano Her parents called this school Kusano didn't do such a thing Can you prove it? It's the decision of the Headmaster I'm in a bind here I'm the head teacher of this class one of my students is suspended You're not convincing at all - obviously, it's unfair What's the matter GTU You don't need to be convinced The decision is already taken We teachers decide which rule is enforced and when You students abide by our decisions and keep quiet Headmaster Daimon Isn't this going too far? Asano and Kusano should have been heard first We are not interested in the truth First, the fact that people were talking about it was a problem in itself This is so arbitrary And anyone else among you could be suspended too Suzuki is suspected of smoking in front of the station Nakajima has illicit sexual relations with her boyfriend We have many more We can catch you anytime It's a boycott then - What are you saying If Kusano is suspended I'll boycott the school What do you say guys? If you do that your record points will suffer You won't enter the university of your choice or the company of your choice Do you want to ruin your future? If that is fine with you you can boycott or whatever Those who decided to boycott Are considered rebels against the school and expelled Wait a minute If you do that this class is terminated This school doesn't need students who can't abide by the rules Welcome Eikichi Eikichi ... the glasses of water Shape up He's getting worse day by day This is a consequence of his resignation Teacher, it's terrible what happened What's that? I'm not a teacher anymore Kusano ... Kusano is suspended indefinitely What's this .. you suspended Kusano? A violation of the rules causes a penalty You are responsible for it - I'm responsible? You did go to Kusano's place yesterday? I warned you don't associate with students anymore Hadn't you met with Kusano he wouldn't have been suspended Considering his family situation and that he holds a part-time job I would have been inclined to leniency But you broke your promise You compelled me to that decision And Miki Katsuragi will be disciplined too She just came to call me Whatever the reason you should not associate with students or they will be punished Damn you - As long as you're around Students will always be subject to punishment Teacher Onizuka - Onizuka We heard you spoke to the Headmaster on Kusano's behalf So what came out of it? She canceled his suspension? It was impossible I don't have such power anymore In that case I'll join you - I'm not a teacher anymore there's nothing I can help you with anymore Teacher Onizuka Now I'll be out of town So don't try to call me anymore Teacher, are you abandoning us? We have misjudged you Onizuka. We thought you were different from the other adults I'm sorry The friendship you talked about doesn't go further than this? We get it We'll take care of it ourselves Let's go guys Teacher Onizuka I'm responsible for the mess this school is going through I'm sorry teacher Onizuka The promise we made to protect the students whatever happens .. I didn't hold it Mrs. director The management policy that Headmaster Daimon is implementing was originally designed by me I was so self-confidence the results were good but when that incident occurred last year I started to question my methods An educational environment that pushes a student to suicide what is its value? and I met you about that time I owe it to you that I saw what real education could be like to laugh with the colleagues to cry, to get mad, to be moved sometimes experiencing failure and using it to grow in life both students and teacher evolving together I saw that type of teaching Thanks to you so many potentials began to show up this should not be crushed I want to try that again To protect this school and everybody I guess I'll have to make the "German step" forward myself Eikichi You should be standing by the side of your students What are you talking about? Don't lie to yourself You're only thinking of flying to their rescue right now Go then You just go and tell them how you feel ... Will you shut up now I'm not a teacher anymore if I get involved with those guys I'm gonna make it worse they're not my responsibility anymore you have no idea what you're talking about don't bring your nose into this Eikichi It hurts Ryuji, what's this about Damn you, what is this about? You're talking like a spoiled brat What you are now the most stupid adult I can hate These guys, students or not aren't they your friends first? is that how easily you get rid of your friends? Are you that shallow as a friend? A real friend would put his life on the line for them accompany them to hell if need be Am I right about this? These are the rules we've lived by until today There's no easy escape from a fight Open your eyes Eikichi Your friends are in a fix right now If you don't stand up for them now... From today I'll be your head teacher Great Teacher Onizuka That's right That damn Headmaster ... I can't let her have her way with my friends You do it your usual way This is how you overcome adversity This is how we like you the "devil Eikichi" If we don't talk to Asano's parents the misunderstanding will persist If we confront them directly we don't stand a chance In that case, you may want to hear what I have to say Teacher Onizuka Kusano I'm sorry it took me so long Teacher Enough mentioning that I resigned as a teacher I'm your friend in any case Am I right? I have a strategy to reach to Asano's mother I called it "Thank you Kusano" Now Kusano and Fuyutsuki are inside all right then, we can start 'you sure you'll be fine? We have to do it? I'll pretend to rob their place Kusano will drive me out He will surely gain the favor of the parents Asano's mother will go to the school and contest the suspension decision I'm sure the Headmaster will cancel that suspension Sounds a bit simplistic to me Just leave it to me Alright Just get in and get it done It is a robbery ... kiss the floor What? Excuse me, am I not in the Asano residence? And who are you, idiot? How could I land in the wrong place? Wait ... I can explain everything When is he supposed to come? I don't know What are you discussing under your breath? Nothing ... well Do you have something particular to blame Mr. Kusano for? I don't want him to see my daughter As far as I heard He has neither study nor employment prospect He wants to be a boxer With such uncertain future how would he provide for my daughter? What kind of parent would let that happen? This is your cue if you have something to respond, young man You don't even know him you have no idea what efforts he makes you know nothing about him Mayuko please go back to your room You're acting strange, Mom You just received one fax You said it's for my own sake you don't care how I feel You allow me a date from the elite only You're only looking for respectability You're wrong .. your happiness is at stake I love Kusano because of his dreams and efforts Mayuko - Mayu-chan, stop now I'm sorry Kusano I bring so many bad feelings in your life I'm ashamed having such kind of mother Now, I have come to hate this life You're behaving like an idiot It hurts I'm risking my life here You're late teacher Onizuka I was delayed upstairs Well thanks to that I arrested an international gang Asano, don't play with dangerous toys Don't come I want to die A knife is painful you stab your neck if you can't cut an artery properly you don't die ... did you know that? Suppose you manage to kill yourself What will Kusano become he will never recover from seeing the girl he loves die before his eyes Whether you succeed or fail it serves no purpose it doesn't serve you your mother or Kusano Think of it ... life is your best option Tomorrow you have a date with Kusano It's a bit early for a first kiss though You're Asano's Mom? Please to meet you I'm their former head teacher Onizuka This guy certainly doesn't belong to the elite But he strives so hard for his dream with an unshakable faith he is grabbing his ambition by the horns Life is not resolved with good school grades Is it that important to enter university? you don't assess the value of a man by his academic achievement Asano, Kusano You are going to double your efforts so that people recognize your bond Asano's mother is not bad mouthing you she's only expressing her concern I'll work hard for people to recognize us Exactly, that's what it is to be a man Well ... And I proved a man too today overcoming all my obstacles We are on the scene An international gang of drug trafficking was using an apartment here A man claiming to be a teacher arrested them With such courage You're in the way He's coming Thank you I am Eikichi Onizuka head teacher of the class 2-4 I'm presently looking for a girlfriend The person interested should apply at the address popping up below on this screen [?? :) ] Such subtitles won't pop up But celebrities, when they speak like that it pops up Please give us an interview In what circumstances did you find them? Circumstances? The circumstances? Where is it? There's only one camera Headmaster Daimon It's seems that you're spreading chaos The false accusation that Kusano is harassing Asano that you send in a fax Then you suspended Kusano Can you approve that Ladies & Gentlemen? A school's Headmaster resorting to such lowly means She handed out tablets to teachers and students I don't know what she's scheming As long as I live if she abuses power on the students I won't let her get away with it She wants to expel all students from class 2-4 Enough now - Try it if you can Please calm down - Are you going to sue me? That would be great Come and get me I don't know your intention But I will defend the students all fangs and claws This is Eikichi Onizuka Daimon Teacher Onizuka You hear me Daimon-chan Ladies & Gentlemen nationwide her name is Daimon Please remember her name - He's unique this teacher Onizuka Even out of the school he's a force to be reckoned with Keep your friends close but your enemies even closer You plan to reinstate him in his function?
