Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Sophie, off to bed now. We have to leave early tomorrow. Yes, Mom. - You're playing quite well Fritzi. - It's not that difficult. Try it. You just have to practice a bit. Take my harmonica with you on holiday. In two weeks you have learned it. Thank you, but I'd much rather take you with me on holiday. It'd be brilliant if I could go to Hungary with you. What am I supposed to do there without you!? I can't even take Sputnik! - I've never been abroad. - Hungary is not really abroad. The West, like France, America, Australia. That's abroad. But Hungary? Nah! Do you believe what they say in school? That they're all really unhappy over there? Well, they can't be any happier than here. Then why does everybody want to go there? Maybe because they always have bananas and real Coca-Cola. I've never had real Coca-Cola before. Your Grandma lives in the West, what does she say? That Coke isn't good for you. That everything is better. But it's good here as well! Yes, I think so, too. Help! Mom, take it easy! We'll never make it to Hungary this way. There perhaps. But back again very unlikely. - Your Mom has some crazy driving skills. - I know and Hungary is far, far away. Thanks for taking care of Sputnik for us. Don't mention it. Hello there! Quite a bit of luggage for two weeks, isn't it? Women. Get in the car, Sophie. We've got to go. Be a good boy, Sputnik, and do what Fritzi says. No, Sputnik, you've got to stay with Fritzi. I'll send letters. I promise! Take care you two ... Bye! There you are! It's late. Tomorrow is the first day of school. And Sophie still isn't back. Perhaps they extended their holiday a bit. Or something unexpected happened. Isn't there anything more interesting on than boring news? Hello Fritzi! Time for bed. Tomorrow... Is the first day of school. Yeah, I know. And don't forget to set your alarm! Don't be sad, Sophie will be back tomorrow. During this school year, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of our homeland, the German Democratic Republic. After World War II, Germany became a divided country. Over there the Federal Republic as a vassal state of the West. Here, the GDR as part of the community of socialist states. Because of that, after 40 years we can now say with great pride: The German Democratic Republic is the better Germany. - Be ready! - Always ready. - Be ready! - Always ready. That's the spirit. I am Mrs. Liesegang, your new class teacher. And you are the class clown, apparently. - What is your name? - Benni Gobel. Gobel? Isn't your father chairman of the district's school board? Honor and respect for your teachers build the foundation of our socialist school. Especially on the first day. Particularly during our flag ceremony. I gather you are new to this class and you're not a Thalmann pioneer. Bela... Rothkirch?! Yes. And what do you intend to do after you graduate? Study something at university? Well, we'll see about that. Because if you don't support this country now, you can't expect the country to support you in the future. Who speaks for the class representatives? Report: All students are present. Except for Sophie Vollmer. Does anyone know where she is? Everyone knows where she is. - What were you trying to say? - What do you think? The hippies fled the country, to the West! Sophie was just delayed. Besides, she is my friend. You really shouldn't mess with them. Sophie?! Hurry up! Don't need anyone to notice us, do we? Did you hear a dog? Nonsense, they're gone. Doesn't take a genius to see that. Now they're waiting in Hungary, to cross the border somehow. Who reported the desertion from the republic? A colleague, I think ... Look at that, the girly wasn't aware, else she wouldn't have left her Barbie from the West behind. I'll take that for my Rosi. Put it back. This is an inspection, not a preservation of evidence. - Hey, gimme the doll! - Watch it! My glasses! Where did they go? Come on, we still have to write the report. Should've put them on properly. Found them! - Mom? - Hey honey! Just as second, I want to see this. - Darling, please move. - Mom? Did you know that Kati wanted to go to the West? No, I didn't know. Guessed, perhaps. That's why I wasn't allowed to go to Hungary, right? And that's why Sputnik had to stay here, too, right? - Right, mom? - Fritzi, I -- You and Kati are so mean! Kati didn't tell me anything. Honestly. That would've been way too dangerous. - Especially because of the Stasi. - The Stasi can bite me. Whatever you do, you don't want to get in trouble with the Stasi. What is that, anyway, the "Stasi"? They are from the "Ministry for State Security". They're like the police, except they don't protect people. What do they do? The Stasi lock people up just because they don't want to live here anymore. Would they enter the people's homes? They can be trusted to do pretty much anything. Why? - Why did Kati do this? - I think Kati wants to see the world. - That's why she went away. - But Sophie didn't want to leave. She wants to be here with Sputnik, and me. I know it's hard to understand, but Kati also did it for Sophie. Mummy, would you fly to Mars with me? Right now I'll fly to the bathtub with you. - Hello? - Fritzi? - Sophie! Where are you? - Still in Hungary. - When are you coming back? - We can't come back anymore. What do you mean? Come on, aren't you watching the news? Mom and I are deserters of the republic now. - And where do you want to desert to? - To my Grandma's. To the West. Sometimes the border is open, and then it's not. Complete chaos. And now we are stuck here. Sputnik misses you so much. And I miss Sputnik too, and... Sophie? And I miss you too, Fritzi. Fritzi? Sophie? Sophie, I miss you, too. I know what we're going to do. We'll take Sputnik to Hungary. To Sophie. Don't be silly. How is that supposed to work? Hungary is a socialist country as well. People are allowed to go there. Mom, Sputnik misses Sophie so much. - Mom?! - Hello my dears. What's going on? Picture this, Klaus: wants to go see Sophie in Hungary. I want to go to Hungary, too! Nonsense. The borders to Hungary are closed tight, now that so many people want to flee that way. - But... - There really is no way. And you'll see, Sputnik will forget all about Sophie soon. How can you say such a thing? Sputnik will never forget Sophie. Never! Hello? - What do you want? - Do you have trips to Hungary? We have trips to many countries. Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union. Thanks, but I want to go to Hungary. I see. And what do you want to do in Hungary? A holiday!? - Where are your parents? - I'm going by myself. Is that so. And your parents know about this? Of course. I'm not doing anything without my parents' permission. I see. It's such a pity. You know, we're closing in a few minutes. But please come back tomorrow. Let's say around five? And bring a written permission from your parents. That was easier than I thought. Sputnik, we'll be with Sophie in no time at all. Mom and Dad will never allow me to go to Hungary by myself. Perhaps I could forge Dad's signature ... "Forge Dad's signature?" Pretty bold. I hope you know the penalty for forgery is five years of prison. You misunderstood. Five years... so you could be out again by the time we graduate. Could you please stop? You got the wrong idea. Get it? Okay. Got it. By the way, I make a killer apple crumble, with a file inside. - Is this your dog? - No, Sputnik belongs to Sophie. Sophie didn't know her Mom was planning on leaving. She never would have left Sputnik alone. But what's a dog compared to Barbie dolls, bananas, and cola. I doubt that Sophie's mother left the country for a few bananas. - Why else? - Because... life is better in the West? There are people who try to work for a better life right here. This is my stop. Do you have to confess now because you said "The West"? You really don't have a clue what's happening here, do you? Why? What's happening? Catch, Sputnik. Show-off. Sputnik. Come on. Sputnik, stay here. Sputnik! We demand the general right and freedom to demonstrate, because it's not tolerable that our demonstrations are not being approved on spurious grounds or arbitrarily broken up by security forces. What are you up to?! Come with me. We are many today, but if we want a change for our country we will have to be a lot more, and we will have to continue demonstrating. Not just here in Leipzig but everywhere. Peacefully! We have been coming together every Monday here in the Nicholai Church for many years. Because we want change. ...this is not only about the freedom to demonstrate and to say what we want. Jesus says: Be not afraid and love your enemies. Therefore I ask you again today: No violence, no matter what is waiting for us outside. We want out. We want out! And the last one out turns off the lights, or what? We can't just all go over there. But what if we're missing a once in a lifetime opportunity? Our friends are here, our parents, our entire life. What's waiting for us in the West? If we'd even make it there in one piece. - If Kati can make it, we sure can. - And then what? You'd probably find work as a nurse. But I doubt West Germany is waiting for a violin teacher. It's not always just about you, Klaus. What about Fritzi and Hanno? They could graduate and study what they want. Travel where they want. I know, but I cannot and will not put you into this danger. Alone, maybe with two people, it might be possible. But we are four. What? We don't have a bad life here. You're kidding, right? Where have you come from at this hour? That's where I was. You were where? "For an open country with free people." I hope you weren't in the midst of that. Fritzi?! I'm afraid she was. Are you insane? And they're showing this on the Western news. Do you have any idea how dangerous this is? - Not just for you, but for all of us? - Why? Who are those men? Who are they? That's the Stasi, Fritzi! I've explained this to you. These people are really dangerous. - I was just there by accident. - And you will not go there again. - But... - No 'buts', Fritzi. And you better not talk about this in school. Everybody watched that anyway... Look everyone here comes our TV-Star. More like a small-part actress. Or an extra for "Enemy of the Republic". Last night, not far from here, there was an unlawful assembly of troublemakers and ruffians. Not enough that a member of our class was seen there. The incident was also broadcasted on TV stations of capitalist foreign nations for the purpose of a propagandistic smear campaign against our country. So where did we leave off yesterday? Right: Proportional numerical sequences. There weren't any ruffians. Pardon me? I said: Those people weren't ruffians. Did I ask for your opinion? No. And do you think that you are in a position to judge this? Subversive, anti-state agitation is a severe crime. Besides, you probably don't want to risk being excluded from our school trip, do you? You stood up to Liesegang. Yeah, that probably wasn't so smart. I thought it was brave. Really? Want me to give you a ride home? No, I've got to go somewhere. I can take you there. No, I have to do this alone. Stop right there, young lady! - Are you looking for anything? - A kid. A girl. So you're persecuting even kids now? As you can see, there is nobody here. I'll find her. Get going, hurry, he's gone. - Thank you! - You should go home as fast as you can. Come on, move! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thousands of GDR citizens have left Hungary in the direction of West Germany today. They're coming. They have been arriving here since last night ... They have really seized their chance. There must be more than 4,000 refugees by now. Sophie and Kati among them? I'm sure of it! - So they are not in Hungary anymore? - Looks like it. So will they go to the West now? To Sophie's Grandma? - I would think so. - And what about Sputnik? Dad? In a few years Sophie will probably be allowed to come to the GDR again. - Then she can visit us. - In a few years? In a few years! Okay, that's the Center we're going to on the field trip, and that's where Sophie is. But there's the border in between. Maybe we need a little help. Good morning, Fritzi. Are you waiting for me? For you? Of course not. Why would I wait for you? No problem, but it sure looked like it. Tell me, have you ever been to West Germany? Have I been where? Forget it. It was just a question. Well, why don't you ask the border officer in class today. The border is our antifascist protection barrier against evil imperialist endeavors by the capitalist West. And especially against the Federal Republic of Germany. But now you probably have a lot of questions. Who has a question for our guest? Kai, you probably want to ask something, don't you? Yes, you over there. What exactly does an anti-imperialist protection barrier look like? I mean, how do the border patrol officers manage to keep those Western people from coming over to us? Why do you want to know that? Yes, Fritzi, why do you want to know that? Because... because... We want to make a border illustration. For our wall newspaper. I see. But unfortunately, I still cannot answer your question. - That's top secret, do you understand? - But why is it secret for us? I thought it was about nobody coming in. Or is it actually supposed to keep people from getting out? Well... you see... I think we're done for today. We thank the Comrade Officer for his visit. Fritzi, you'll wait for me outside. You too, Bela. I've just recently been assigned to this class, Comrade. And the kids are very lively and curious. That is why it is so important to set an example of clear ideological leadership. Comrade Liesegang. If there is anything I cannot tolerate in my class, it's troublemakers and know-it-alls. It's up to you whether you want to integrate and be part of the group or not. Do you really want to continue on this path and be socially excluded for the rest of your lives? I'll be keeping an eye on you two. Thanks for trying to get me out of trouble. No problem. Come with me, I'll show you something. That's pretty far up. - You aren't scared of heights, are you? - Of course not. It's great here. I just need some time to get used to the height. Let's say about one or two hours? Come on, this way. Tell me you are not breaking into this apartment. First forgery of signatures, now breaking and entering. What's next desertion from the republic? Okay: That's the School Vacation Center we're going to, very close to the border. And what's this? That's where Sophie is now, at her Grandma's in West Germany. What exactly are we talking about here, Fritzi? - I want to bring Sputnik to Sophie. - Across the border? - To the Federal Republic of Germany? - Of course to West Germany. That's where Sophie's Grandma lives. But the border is completely secured and protected. With soldiers. With dogs. And weapons. Well, they can hardly be everywhere at once. You just have to wait for the right moment. You're crazy. Sophie misses Sputnik so much. How will you and Sputnik get across? They're shooting with live ammo. I don't think they'll shoot at us. We are no criminals, after all. I'll just find a gap in the fence. A gap. Sure. And then what? I have the address and phone number of Sophie's Grandma. That won't help you. All maps of the border area are fake. People aren't supposed to find their way out of the GDR too easily. - So what do you suggest? - You need a compass. But I don't have a compass. I'll check if I have one at home that you can use. Great! Here's what we'll do: Before we leave, you'll distract Liesegang and I'll smuggle Sputnik into the bus. Distract Liesegang? I was going to get you a compass, not risk my life. Can't I distract a border officer instead? Or two? Or maybe two hundred? Are you sure you don't want me to take you? Thanks, but I'll manage by myself. Mrs. Liesegang doesn't seem so bad after all, if she even allows you to take Sputnik with you? Hey darling. It's only for four days. Bye, Mom. Get in! If all goes well, we'll be with Sophie by tomorrow. What do you want, Rothkirch? Leave your bag and get on the bus. Can't you be more careful? This seat is taken! I'm not feeling well. I have to lay down. Gastrointestinal complaints, you know?! Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting. That's so gross! Come on, we'll find a seat up front. I think I may ... Get away from me! Can you read a compass? W as in West. Not that hard. Thanks. I'll come and get you when everyone's asleep. Come on Sputnik, we have to hurry. The map is useless here. Now we have to depend on this. Sputnik, come back! - Sputnik! - Bela? - What are you doing here? - Sputnik scared me. I'm your escort until we reach the border. - That's West. - Let's go then. The forest ends there. The border must be beyond that. Doesn't look so difficult. If you say so... Where is Sputnik? - Sputnik, stay here! - Quiet! - Fritzi! - Sputnik! Come here! Stop, don't move! Stop or I'll shoot! - Sputnik, no! - It's a child! I'll ask you once again: What were you doing in the border zone? Desertion from the republic is a crime! Perhaps you do not realize that. Who else was at the border with you? Where are your parents?! We will deal with her parents. An address in West Germany. Interesting. My parents don't have anything to do with this. - It was all my idea. - You're lying! You cannot have been by yourself! Come on! Fess up! There really wasn't anyone with you? ...nobody. Just Sputnik. Who is Sputnik? A Soviet? - A double agent? - No, my dog. A dog? Comrade Major, we did not capture any other civilians in the border zone. Dismissed. What should we do with the girl now? I'm sure we'll find a cozy place to sleep for the little runaway, won't we. Everything else will be decided tomorrow. Sputnik! You found him! Come with me! Make sure that the girl receives a proper punishment. What about the parents? I could arrange for them to ... We will see to the parents. Now we all have to leave early because of that stupid hippie. - Yes, totally anti-social! - Freak. - Traitor. - Quiet! I'm sorry... I just ran away. I'm glad they didn't catch you, too. - Did you really go to the border? - What do you care? I was just... my uncle... Hey, Birgit, get over here! Release my daughter immediately! I'm not sure you understand the severity of your daughter's wrongdoing?! My daughter is not a criminal. And now open this door! There will be consequences. For your daughter and for you. What were you thinking? Across the border! I just wanted to take Sputnik to Sophie. Just take Sputnik!? Do you have any idea how many people have already been shot at this border? - I'm sorry. - The Stasi was here. They thought we were trying to cross the border and just left our daughter there all by herself. Only they could come up with something like that. Because Fritzi had the address of Sophie's grandmother and because you are Kati's best friend. It's pure luck that the three of us are not sitting in prison by now. But it feels like we're locked up anyway. The entire country is a prison. The school administration has decided to initiate a procedure of exclusion for your fellow student Fritzi Langmann. I hope that this serves as a lesson for you all. - We have to do something. - What's there to do? We could speak with the class representatives. With Benni?! Well, maybe not with him. But with Kai or Birgit. They're kind of alright, don't you think? I didn't want to cause any trouble. I just wanted to bring Sophie's dog to her. Are you alright? My uncle wanted to flee across the border, too. And did he make it? He was shot to death. More than 3,000 GDR citizens, who had sought refuge in the embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Prague, are now allowed to depart. Secretary of State Hans-Dietrich Genscher ... But people can't just all get up and leave! Don't you think it's brave what the people are doing at St. Nicholai Church? - Yes, those people are very brave, but... - But it's much too dangerous there. But shouldn't we support them nevertheless? We have enough problems already with the Stasi and your procedure of exclusion. So please, stay away from there. Fritzi, here! That must be Sputnik. I have to say, you're creating quite a commotion for a dog. So you are Fritzi. - Bela has told me a lot about you. - Dad! There are even more people here than last Monday! We are the people! - I'm glad you could make it after all. - I also want things to change too. It's just not fair that Sputnik and I are not allowed to see Sophie. She's my only friend. And what am I? Not a... friend?! - My dad! How did he know I'm here?! - You didn't tell your parents? They never would've let me come! We have to get out of here. But my dad is still over there. Daddy! - Come on, we have to go! - Leave me alone! Where have you been? Dad has been looking for you. I was at the demonstration. I didn't believe it, but your Dad thought so. He went there to look for you. The police suddenly started arresting random people. People who didn't even do anything. What about Dad? They arrested Klaus? They won't tell me anything. I don't know where Klaus is. Yes... We haven't heard from him in five days. My Dad says the Stasi is just trying to break our spirit. That it's nothing but a helpless demonstration of power. Maybe Sophie really is better off, now that she's in the West. - Sophie is with her Grandma now. - And what's is she writing about? That she misses everything: Sputnik, me, the tree house. School not so much. When is the announcement about your expulsion? Tomorrow. As you all know, the class representatives have discussed the case of your fellow student Fritzi Langmann. Representatives, what is your decision? We have formed an opinion about Fritzi's behavior and took a vote on the case. Because we Thalmann pioneers always seek to know the truth and work for socialism. We strive to make our group a strong community and give friendly assistance to other students. With this in mind, the majority of representatives found: that Fritzi should remain at the school. Because we think that with her bravery and unwavering friendship, Fritzi is a role model for us all. The border is not there for protection. I just wanted to cross it to bring Sophie's dog to her. - But they almost shot at me. - What!? Silence! I said silence, Rothkrich! - But I didn't say! - All of you! Be quiet! Quiet! Now they can't expel you anymore. "A role model for us all." "We are one nation! Violence among us will leave bleeding scars forever! The party and the government above all are accountable for the grave situation that occurred." My Dad says, they want to deploy tanks at tonight's demonstration. We still have to go. All of us. Everyone. - Where do you think you're going? - Free Daddy! Fritzi, what's this about? Please, Mom, let's all go to the demonstration. How did it turn out in school? - They decided that I can stay. - That's fantastic, Fritzi! Please mom! Bela is going to the demonstration as well. We have to go there too mom! Please! Join us! Let's join them mom. Can we go? Yes. We will go. Join us! Hey, you're back! - Are you an Indian? - Yes, some kind of Indian. Me and my blood brothers and sisters are here to fight for our ancestral rights. We want our land back! We are the people! We are the people! The demonstration has already made it once around the inner city. And nothing happened. The police aren't attacking. - We're winning! - Yes! We're simply too many! This is where the Stasi is headquartered. In this castle. We're not ruffians! We are the people! "Tens of thousands of Leipzig citizens..." Citizens it says. Not ruffians. Is that all it says? - Daddy? - Hello! Since the historic events on Monday, October 9th, 1989, protests against the regime have expanded rapidly across the country. More and more people are participating in the Monday Demonstrations in Leipzig. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is now under new leadership. The 10th conference of the Central Committee in Berlin unanimously appointed Egon Krenz as Secretary-General... Will Sputnik stay with us forever now? No Hanno. Sputnik belongs to Sophie. Therefore we decided to draw up a regulation today that will enable every GDR citizen to leave the country through all border crossing points of the GDR. Hello, hi guys! I don't know what this means, either. Can't they just once make a clear statement?! Is the border open or not? Can we travel to the West? So you don't know anything, either... Alright. When do we leave? - To go where? - To Sophie, of course, to the West. Yes, we saw the press conference. Hold on a moment. We don't know if we're really allowed to leave yet. But what else is this new travel regulation supposed to mean? But you said it yourself just now on the phone. It was just some politician saying something on TV. But I can't imagine that this is really true. Maybe it's just a political maneuver. Okay. We'll go and find out. - I bet Sophie will go to the border, too. - So Sputnik will see Sophie soon? Yes, Hanno, they will. Would you look at that! Amazing! You go ahead, I'll stay here with Hanno. - Step back! - Open the gate! All of you must vacate the border zone now. Immediately! We have not received any order to open the border. Step back! Sputnik! Fritzi! Sophie! Fritzi! Sputnik! Maybe the border won't open, after all. But you will get across no matter what. Sputnik! Come on, now. Fritzi! Fritzi! Go Sputnik! Sophie is waiting for you! - Go! Run! - Go Sputnik! Fritzi! Sputnik! Stop! Don't move! Sputnik, go! Sputnik, go! - The border is open in Berlin! - West Radio is prohibited! What do they say in headquarters? Can't get a hold of anyone. They're playing dead. - Sophie! - Fritzi! Fritzi, you brought Sputnik to me! Fritzi, you did it! You opened the border! Me? Nonsense. I didn't do anything. Did anything happen? I'm glad you are back. I was getting a little scared. Now that the border is open we can go back and forth whenever we want to. I'll visit Sophie and Sputnik on Christmas. What do you have in your bag? My Dad said that you would probably like to have one. Thank you! What will you call him? How about Ruffy? Ruffy the ruffian!
