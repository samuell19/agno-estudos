Mr. Spenser, are you prepared to tell the court, in your own words, what happened on the afternoon of March 20th? Yes, Your Honor. Please proceed. I had my partner drive me to the home of Captain John Boylan. Your commanding officer? That's right. I had prior reason to believe that Captain Boylan was intentionally burying the murder investigation of Gloria Weisnewski... Mr. Spenser, please focus on the events that transpired on the afternoon of March 20th. I confronted Captain Boylan in his home and attempted to question him about the investigation. The hell are you doing here? And the ensuing argument... Can't wait outside the front door? I mean, everybody knows what happened. Get out of our house! Hey! Get out of here. Get the fuck out of our house... At all times, I knew that these actions were in violation of the law and the code of conduct that I swore to obey as a Boston police officer. So, it is my understanding that you are pleading guilty to the charge of disturbing the peace? Yes, Your Honor. How do you plead on the count of harassment in the first degree? - Get off him! - Guilty. And how do you plead on the count of aggravated assault of a police officer? Guilty. Before I sentence you, is there anything further that you would like to add? Yes. The son of a bitch deserved it. What do you say, Spense? Hey, Squeeb. Hey, new little fun fact for you. You know, Saguaro cactus lives for over 150 years? Now, you cut one down in Arizona, you can do a year in prison. Imagine that? Shit. I know guys that rob people in here - doin' less time than that. - Right? How does it feel gettin' out? I haven't slept in a few nights. But other than that... How you doin', Squeeb? How you feelin'? I feel like a lifer. You know, a lot of guys feel that way. But you're different. How many cops get to do their time in gen pop? Zero. I can't think of one. But, I mean, that's probably why you're so popular in here. I'm popular? Wow, I had no idea. What're you gonna do when you get out? Back in the real world? Yeah. Go to Fenway Park, you know, get a big-ass, juicy rib eye. You got a girl, right? I got a girl. Her name is Pearl. Yeah, I'm probably just gonna lay down in my bed and let her lick me all over. Pearl. Sounds like an old lady's name, no? You know, she's a little older. She makes up for it in loyalty. 'Sup, bookworm? Not much. How's Aryan Nation treatin' everybody? State of the Union still strong? You know, we just wanna let you know how important it is that you're gettin' out of Boston and never comin' back, drivin' a truck or doin' whatever the hell you're doin'. Yeah, we have a little, uh, goin' away message for you. For me? Well, can't be from the guys in here. They like me, right? So, who's sending the message?

I'm sorry I couldn't visit you more at Walpole, brother. Look, I'm glad you came up. And I really appreciate you sendin' me the books. It's all good. I brought you a gift. - Donuts? - I wanna keep you on your toes. Hey. Impressive how you did your time. As a former police officer, I was very, very popular in there. That's for sure. Man. So, what's next? That's the big question. Look, I'm gettin outta here, you know? There ain't shit for me here. I'm gonna drive a semi, you know? Look at sunsets. Shit like that. Ah, maybe it's for the best. There's still a lot of cops around here who'd love to put a mark on you. Well, I get in a hassle, I know who to call. That's fuckin' right.

Pearl. Pearly, baby. Hey. Pearly. Henry, she won't even look at me. She gave me the cold shoulder. Baby, I'm sorry that I was gone. I know five years is way too long. Thirty-five years from her perspective. No more cold winters for you. You're gonna keep your little paws in the desert, you're gonna chase little bunny rabbits in the sand. Huh? There's no bunny rabbits in Arizona. They got snakes and scorpions. She wouldn't last a week. You gotta shut the fuck up, okay? I'm just tryin' to have a moment here and apologize for my absence to my baby girl. We're gonna go to Arizona, all right? I'm gonna drive a truck and I'm never gonna let you go. I'll have one hand on the wheel and the other hand on you. We'll put a little bed right beside my chair. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Baby, you got the breath. Didn't I tell you to buy the Greenies? You didn't get her the dog biscuits for her breath? Uh, I'm going inside. Hey, thank you for my very own room. Yo! Henry! - What? - You said I had my own room. Hawk, this is Spenser. Spenser, this is Hawk. You two are gonna be roommates. Toilets are flushed at all times. Food is labelled. No fighting in the house and if there's going to be any drinking, I instigate it. Now, I'd like you two to get to know each other. There's my girl. Yes. You love Daddy. You love Daddy, don't you? Who's a big monster, huh? Who's a monster? Ooh. Give me my dog. Give me the dog. Come on. Come here, baby. Come here. There. You're gonna stay here with Daddy. Okay? Can you talk to your daughter? Put her on and I'll talk to her. Hi, Daddy. Hey! Hey, sweetheart. Dad, I really need your help with my report. I was straight A's in English. I'll help you with the paper. That'd be awesome, Dad. Are you gonna be home soon? When I get there, I'll read what you have so far and we'll talk about it. Oh, sweetheart, hold on a second, I got another call. Boylan, are you there? I'm here, what's up? He wants to meet everyone at the bus yard ASAP. - What the fuck is this all about? - Just be there. All right. Sweetheart, yeah, listen, I got a little bit of bad news. - Dad... - No, it's not... It's nothing. I'm gonna be about 15, 20 minutes late. I just got a call. You know this report's a big deal. I need you to read it one more time. Listen, the thing about the book, you've written all this beautiful stuff about the darkness, about winter falling, about the darkness inside the place, the darkness in Zenobia's heart. Just stay with that idea - and take it all the way through. - Really? I think it's a beautiful idea. I really do. - I think you should have confidence. - Uh-huh. Now, I read the first draft and I gave you some notes. But basically, what I'm tellin' you, you turn that thing in, you probably get an A on the first draft. But I know I'm not... Dad, what happened? Dad? Dad! Dad, what was that? - Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off! - Daddy! - You know who you're dealing with? - Daddy! You can't do this to a cop. - Dad! - I'm a fuckin' cop. I'm a fuckin' cop. You talked to the wrong people, asshole. I didn't give anything! I swear to God I didn't give anything! I didn't give a fuckin' thing. I didn't give 'em anything. I swear. Please, God. Good mornin', Boston. Welcome to April 18th. We're gonna have some picnic weather today, can you believe that? With highs in the upper sixties. That's right, you heard me. Upper sixties and zero chance of rain, so pack up the kids, pack up the sandwiches, and pour yourself some luscious lemonade, because it's spring time in Boston, people. And have yourself a wonderful day. Next stop is Fifth Street, in five minutes. What the hell? Terry? Terrence? What happened to the... Terrence! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, somebody help me. Terrence! Terry! Are you fuckin' with me? Are you? Hey. He snores. What happened here? Oh, a little going away present. I got groceries for you. Don't eat anything on the right side of the fridge. It belongs to Hawk. Aw, do you got any real food? Frankfurters are mine. The rest is his. Where's the giant? Gets up at five, starts running. We got no milk. There's some oatmeal milk in there, but it belongs to Hawk. Oat milk? What the fuck is that? Who knows? All I know is he drinks it all the time. What? Do you have to put somethin' in it? Well, what would you put in it? I don't know, Henry. Take a wild guess. Maybe water or milk or somethin'. If you put milk in it, you might as well use milk. It's been confirmed that the victim is Boston Police Captain John Boylan. Unofficial sources have described it as an execution-style killing. No arrests have been made. - Back to you in the studio. - Holy shit. Thank you for that. There is a city-wide manhunt... Jesus Christ. Somebody killed Boylan? Was it you? Police are being tight-lipped on the case so far, but witnesses say they saw a dark blue SUV... Son of a bitch, they finally killed Boylan. You wanna guess who that could be? I can see 'em. - That's pretty quick, huh? - Yeah. Wow. Well, this is a surprise. Yeah. Sorry, Spense, I gotta ask you. Where were you last night? You know how it is. Captain Boylan dies the same night that you get out. You're on the top of the suspect list. He was right here. I tucked him in myself. Not only that, he's got a roommate that was sleepin' ten feet away from him. That's more like three feet, Henry, but thank you very much. All right. An alibi's a beautiful thing. Let's go. - That's it? - Yep. If it turns out I like you for this, the DA will pop the old guy's story like a balloon. John Boylan was a good cop. You should tell that to Mrs. Boylan. At least with him dead, she can stay out of the emergency room. - Help me help you. - You know what, big mouth? I graduated the Academy two years after you did. And I work Homicide. I wear a suit and carry a gold shield. Who the hell are you? - Nothing. - Okay, let's go. An ex-con. I'm livin' your dream life, you piece of shit. Enough! Man's got an alibi. Let's go. Sorry, Spense. You're on the list. This Boylan thing... It's, uh... It's a problem. It's a real problem. You're lucky you're going to Arizona. Wish I was goin' with you, man. Shit. Say hi to that cactus for me. Get in the car, man. It's over. Stop. Shit. Welcome home. Come on, I'll make you somethin'. Police Chief John Boylan was found dead early this morning, in what sources are calling "a gruesome execution-style murder." Captain Boylan is a 22-year veteran of the Boston PD. This, from Boston Mayor Marty Langs just moments ago. When a police officer gets killed, it's a death that hits us all. It is the death of a family member for all of us. Today, every citizen of Boston has lost a family member. And we grieve together as a family. We will heal... Hey! Wait! You! What the hell's the matter with you? Can't you read? Oh, I'm sorry. You here for the school? I didn't see the sign there. Yeah. Well, there's a sign. - Can't you read? Get in. - Okay. I'm sorry about that. - Yeah. - Beautiful truck. She is. Her name is Black Betty. First rule in this class is to take everything you've learned about being in a four-wheeler and flush it down the toilet. Your hands and feet are in charge of 80,000 pounds of fast moving steel and you must be the smartest person on the road at all times. You need to be awake, you need to be alert and in charge. You mess up, and a mini-van with three sleeping kids, and they get flattened like a pancake. And nowadays, there are all these cameras everywhere. You're not gonna get away with it. Now let's get to today's lesson, okay? Any questions? Any questions? Any questions? - Hey, Spenser. - Hey. Cissy called a bunch of times. - How many times? - Like 22 times. Twenty-three times. I'm not here, okay? He's not here. Quit fuckin' around. I want you to take a look at Hawk. This kid is raw, but I think he's got a lot of talent. I think he could be somethin' special. Time! - You punch like a bitch. - What the fuck? - Hey! Time! Time! - Say that fuckin' shit again! Hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up! Get him outta there! Get him outta there! Get him the hell outta here! Out, out! Get him out! Get the fuck off me, man! Hey. You're a fighter, all right? You gotta be able to control yourself. Henry, this guy doesn't even know how to throw a punch. You hear him? Haven't I been tellin' you that? That you don't know how to throw a punch? How about I kick you in the fuckin'... There'll be no kicking till you learn how to punch. He's gonna teach you. - I'm not workin' with him. - Yeah, you are. - I'm not. No. - You are. - I want you to work with me. - I'm not doing it. - I'm asking you to do it. - I don't give a shit. One, two. Hey, hey. Just punch, all right? Keep your feet on the ground. Throw a hook. Let me see a hook. Uppercut. Oh, my God. All right, no, no. Dude, stop, stop. Hips. You gotta turn the hips, all right? Turn the hips. Boom. Turn, turn, turn. - Turn. Turn. - Like that? Yeah. You don't need muscle to knock somebody out. Spenser. Incoming. Incoming! Where is he? ♪ Mississippi Queen ♪ Oh, shit. I waited all this time. I gotta come find you here? Can we talk over here for a sec... Just come and talk with me for a second, please? No. I'm gonna talk, you are gonna listen. - Don't keep backin' me up, okay? I... - You don't like it? - You don't like the way this feels? - Cut the shit. - You know what I think? - What? I think you like it in there so much, you come here. Bunch of grown men slappin' and ticklin' each other like fuckin' gorillas. I'm in here working. I'm tryin' to better my life. That's it. And you stopped coming to see me. What's the problem? I thought you moved on. You were in prison! - What was I supposed to do? Wait? - Yeah. With no ring? Goin' up there every week so we could have riveting conversations, like, how much I missed your cock? No, I just figured you moved on. What you're calling "move on" is me just living. I am a very successful... - Keep turning your hips, bro. - Look at me when I'm talking to you. I'm a very successful small business owner. People line up around the block to work with me. I got poodles comin' out of my ass. Everybody wants to work... Excuse me, Miss Davis. Spenser's working. Maybe you could talk to him later? - What? Are you his bodyguard now? - It's okay. Look, look. Look at me. Look at me. Listen, okay? I'm sorry. All right? I am. I mean it. You are incapable of real intimacy. And I came here to tell you I never wanna see you again. Bye. All right. Energy in, energy out. Henry? He's a very strange person. Thanks. ...identified the body of the male found in this SUV behind me as Boston Police Detective Terrence Graham. Thank you. I understand Graham is now the lead suspect in the murder case of Boston Police Captain John Boylan. I know that kid. Terrence Graham's death was by gunshot and we're hearing that that gunshot was self-inflicted. There's no way. This kid was a good kid, Henry. Clean. I was in tactical training with him. I've never seen somebody as happy as him. Married, pregnant wife. There's no way he's taking his own life. Graham worked in the narcotics division with Captain John Boylan who, just hours before, was found dead in a South Boston bus yard. Now, police believe Terrence Graham viciously murdered Captain Boylan and are calling it a murder-suicide. That's dark. A murder this city - is trying to come to grips with. - Wow. That's convenient. Ah, what the hell difference does it make? You're gonna be in Arizona, drivin' a truck. That's right, Henry. It's none of my business. Officer Graham is survived by his wife Letitia and their son Rowan. What you're saying is not true! Terrence was a good policeman! Why doesn't anyone know what's happening? He was a good husband! He was a good father! What's going on? Tell me what's really happening! Don't do it, Spense. - Don't tell me to calm down! - Let it go. Walk away. Why? Why? Why? Why? Mrs. Graham? Mrs. Graham! Hey. Sorry... No, I didn't mean to scare you. - What do you want? - Sorry about that. I, uh... Look... I was, um... I was a friend of Terrence. I just wanted to talk to you for a minute. Who are you? Uh, my name is Spenser. I don't know if Terrence told you about me. Um, I got into a situation years ago with John Boylan. It sent me to prison for quite some time. That was you? Yeah. I just thought maybe I could help you in some way. Help, how? Uh, I don't know, find the truth? Did your husband have any problems with Boylan? Terry thought Boylan was a loudmouth whose ego could fill a room. You know, old school, above the law cop who liked to flaunt his power. Yeah, that's Boylan to a T. Boylan called Terrence "altar boy." Did Terrence have the technical knowledge to disable the airbag in your vehicle? Why? Well, because you can't use a vehicle as a ram unless you can disable the airbags. Mmm-mmm. They didn't ask me that. Why didn't they ask me that? Because they already know the answer. They found drugs in our home. Mrs. Graham, we got a warrant. They said he was dirty. Said he was dealing. They knew right where to look, didn't they? Check this wall. They went right up to it. Jackpot. Look what we got here, Mrs. Graham. Your husband was dealing narcotics. And they said they could pin me for conspiracy and take my boy away. Well, believe them, okay? They can and they will. When is the last time you saw your husband? The night before? Terrence said he had to meet his partner. Um, Scott Traylor? And they... They went to some cop bar. Sláinte? Yeah. I know who Scott Traylor is. I'll dig up anything I can, see if it helps. And this... - This revenge for you? - No. My mom wasn't dealt a good hand either. But she was fierce, tough, and she had a lot of heart. I got a lot of flaws, Mrs. Graham. Believe me, a lot. But anything I got good in me, it came from her. Sounds like she was a good woman. Keep an eye on your son. I'll be in touch, okay? ♪ Sweet Caroline, pa, pa, pa ♪ ♪ Good times never seemed so good ♪ ♪ So good, so good ♪ Hmm. You Scotty Traylor? Terrence Graham's partner? Who are you? I know Terrence didn't do what they're pinning on him. I'm gonna go take a piss. Come see me. You know, it hit me who you are. A lot of guys in this bar, they celebrated when you got locked up. You and I both know Terrence was not a crooked cop. Was he in this bar the night Boylan was killed, yes or no? Yes. And did he suspect Boylan of bein' a dirty cop? Huh? Unbelievable. How was Walpole? Did you work your way right up to the honeymoon suite? Wow, Patrolman Macklin. Hear how heavy you guys are breathin' from walkin' 50 steps? What the hell are you doin' here? This isn't a bar for boy scouts. Well, I said something insensitive to this young man who recently lost his partner and I think you guys just saved me an ass kicking, so thank you. He didn't do nothin'. He apologized. Yeah? Did you apologize for beatin' down your own captain? I never got the chance. Jesus Christ. The set of balls on you. I don't know if you noticed it, but it's Sergeant Macklin now. Wow. For you to be a sergeant, I'd say all your superiors must be dead, no? That's impossible. So, what was it? A clerical error or they just get a tax break hiring a mentally stunted dickhead like yourself? Jesus, you are a prick. Thank you. Aah! Bad mother... Oh, that was good. That was good. That was real good. Come on already, will you? We're gonna cut those out. Give me that asshole. Shit! Fuck. Hey, asshole. Get the fuck out of Massachusetts. You fuckin' hear me, Spenser? You're done. See you later. - I need to use your bathroom. - Customers only. Fine. Here. Now it's official. Give me the key. There. It's down the hall, to the right. Bingo. Dude, you can't be back here! What are you doing? I just need the tape from your cameras. From the other day. Oh, it's not a tape. Well, I need this hard drive! That's the cable box. - What? - That's the cable box. Where's the hard drive? How do you get the footage from the cameras? They're in the cloud. What the fuck is a cloud? - The cloud. Yeah... - Listen, dude... Don't play with me right now. Give me the cloud. Ooh, I thought you knew how to punch. - There was four of them. Okay? - You good? Oh, no, no. I'm not good. I don't know how to work this computer shit. Sit down, will you? Come on, please. Thank you. Let me look at the top right camera. That's Terrence Graham's car. It was used in the Boylan hit. Let's see what happens when he comes out. There he is. All right, hold on. Who are you meeting, Terrence? That's a Corvette Z06. Can you zoom in a little bit? It's too blurry. Shit! It means you're looking for a fat, old, white dude with three divorces and a micro-dick. Why's that? Who else you think drives a Corvette like that? Go back to the other camera. Now, fast forward. Wait, wait, wait. Zoom in a little more. Let me see. So, they all left together. You got any idea who those guys are? I don't know, but I know where they went. One, two, uppercut. One, two! One, two! Come on! Stick and move. Stick and move. Stick and move. One, two, one, two. That's it. Move, move it. That's it. Come on. Punch it. Time. Hey, he keeps dropping that right hand after he throws it. Spenser! What the hell are you doing here? You thinkin' of leavin' Cimoli's? No, look, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Terrence Graham. Man, anything seem off to you about it? Yeah. The fact that you're askin' me about it. What are you, a private detective now, huh? Is that what's goin' on here? 'Cause I was under the impression that a convicted felon can't get a license. With your connections, I could probably get a pardon. Listen, let this one go. Graham's dirty, drugs in his house. Look, they said that Boylan was killed in the school bus yard, right? And that Terrence Graham rammed him first with his SUV? That's how he got the drop on him. Yeah, but they found his SUV outside of his house. Then he drove himself home and blew his brains out. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes here... No, the air bags should've went off. He wouldn't have been able to drive it at all. Well, he must've disabled 'em. Yeah, but it doesn't add up. Why drive all the way home? To shoot himself? Run the risk of his kid walkin' out and seein' him dead in the car? Spenser, the man was not in his right mind. And what about the crime scene? Everything added up, right? Beats me. I haven't been there. You haven't been there? What do you mean you haven't been there? No, I haven't been there. Spenser, why would I go there? The case is closed. You're home, baby. Let it go. Let it go, man. The only thing that it's gonna bring you is grief, pain, frustration. Let it go. I gotta get back to work, I ain't gettin' no younger. All right. He's right, I'm keepin' my right hand too low. One, two! One, two! Investigation into the brutal double homicide that has rocked the city of Boston continues today. We're hearing inside the Boston Police Department, that Officer Terrence Graham lured Captain Boylan to an isolated city school bus yard where he killed him violently. It is believed Terrence Graham is the only suspect. Block, block, block, block... Oh, you see that? You gotta be able to move, all right? Defense is the best offense sometimes. Go. That's pretty perfect. Do I get a shot at drivin' the Black Betty? You're not ready, Mr. Spenser. Well, uh, she sure is a pretty truck. There you go. Yeah. Okay. Get in. Now, block. Good. And block, block, block. - Oh, you see that? - Yeah. You have to listen. All right? Yeah. City officials are planning a funeral to honor the fallen Captain Boylan and will announce details shortly. Good job. I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat. You want somethin'? - Thank you. - For what? The boxing. You're right, I need it. I'm just doin' what Henry asked me to do. Got one Green Goddess for the gentleman. Gonna like this a lot more than prison food, I guarantee you. I don't know about that. What'd you go up for? Manslaughter. Reduced from murder one. Served four years, out on good behavior. And now, thanks to Henry, I'm changin' my life. Oh, God. I wanna be the LeBron James of MMA. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that's impressive. I'm gonna use my gifts to make a difference in the world like my dad would've wanted. Your dad, huh? What was he like? He was a good guy. Military man, pilot. Man of the world type, you know? We moved around a lot. Settled in New Orleans. He witnessed some real messed up shit in our community. Everybody told him to look the other way. He couldn't. He died, a hero. Not minding his own business. And what happened? I'm not gonna get into that, not with you. - Probably not ever, actually. - Fair enough. I'm gonna go wash my hands. It's fine. Whatever you want. Yeah, chill out. Relax. Hey, what are you doin'? You followin' me? Uh, I came to the bathroom first. You followed me in here. So, you're following me. What are you doin' in this restaurant? I came to meet a friend. - What are you doin'? - Hmm. - Don't be ridiculous, okay? - Don't be ridiculous. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Don't! You know what? You... - What? We're not doing... - We're not doing this today. - We're not doin' what? Oh, we're just gonna go. You're the one putting your hands on me. - I'm just guiding you back to the door... - Guiding me? - Where do you wanna guide me? - You're blocking my path. - You locked the door. - Where do you wanna guide me? - Stop that. - You're the one pushin' me. What are you, the lock police? All right, you look good. What do you want from me? I want a lot from you, 'cause guess what? You look good, too. No, you look really good. Yeah? So why don't you do somethin' about it? How about this? Huh? You like this? - Don't touch my fuckin' hair. - All right. You know how I get about my hair. - I know what you like. Come here. - You wanna show me? - Yes? All right. - Yeah. All right. I got you. Stop, stop. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Like that? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, shit! Okay! Okay! Okay! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! Don't you dare fuckin' cum before me. Okay? Fuck yeah. Cissy always finishes first! Fuck me harder! - Fuck! Fuck! - Was that it? Go, Sox! Don't stop! Don't stop! - Don't stop! - Oh, shit! - Oh, my fuckin' God! - Shut up! Oh, my fuckin' God! We're in the window right now, Spenser. - What's that? - Remember the window? You mean the five minutes of peace between us right after we have sex? Yeah. Yeah, lasts about as long as sex with you. - Get off me. - Yeah. Used to be my favorite part of the day. Even better than fuckin'. Well, you seem like you liked it. What, you wanna go again? That time we thought I was pregnant. - Do you remember what you said to me? - Um, I remember the gist. You said, "I'm not sayin' we're gettin' married, but that kid's not gonna be raised without a father." You remember that? It was a false alarm, thank God. But you were gonna do what was right. You always had that strong moral code. I'm movin' to Arizona. I'm gonna start over. Start fresh. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. This is your home. Hell will freeze over before you ever touch me again. You got, um... You got a little stain on your dress there. Just sayin'. Souvenir. Fuckin'... - You enjoy yourself in there? - Mind your business.

Back when the Irish mob existed outside all those shitty movies. There we go. Nice. I think it's time you tell me what's really goin' on here. There was a girl named Gloria Weisnewski. I used to shovel snow off her mother's porch in Southie. She was a smart kid. I watched her grow up. When developers came to Southie, gentrifying and trying to destroy the soul of the city, she couldn't look the other way. We can keep on marching! Where does Tracksuit Charlie come in? Tracksuit Charlie was and is a goon for hire. Somebody paid him to harass Gloria, get her to give up. You shut your mouth! Get your filthy, stinkin' hands out my face! Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you! Then it escalated. Phone calls, threats, harassment. Next thing you know, Gloria comes home and finds her cat nailed to the door. It didn't take a genius to know that it was Tracksuit Charlie that killed Gloria's cat. Couple of weeks later, I was out on a call. Manager at Cumberland Farms had a suspicious vehicle in the parking lot. There was blood leaking from the trunk. We got a... I had to tell her mother. It was almost worse than finding the body. I got you. I don't know, I was so close to the family. They were good, honest people, so I just kept checkin' in. Got handed over to Homicide. But I couldn't let it go. When I followed up on Gloria's case, I found out Homicide was just sittin' on it. They hadn't even questioned Tracksuit Charlie. - Lieutenant. - Sergeant, what are you doing here? I need to speak with you outside for a minute. We're in the middle of somethin'. This is very important. It's in your best interest that you step outside and talk to me. I will actually judge what's in my best interest and you need to start thinking about what's your best interest. Sergeant, get your ass outta here. You get out of here now. We're in the middle of something. Are you in the middle of investigating Gloria Weisnewski's murder? 'Cause you should be, but you're burying it. Why? I think you should step outside and mind your step, son. - Really? - Yeah, you really do. Listen... Don't touch me. Don't touch me, okay? - Wake up! - Get out of here. - Get him outta here! - Let's go. I should've walked away, but I knew he was covering something up. Get out, you piece of shit. And then I get a call from this reporter at the Globe, and he wants to show me this very graphic tape. Has Homicide seen this tape? Yeah, a secretary leaked it to me. It's Gloria Weisnewski. Word is, those animals were part of the Trinitario drug gang. They haven't even questioned the guys workin' the lot yet. - What? - You wanna hear the extent of the sandbag? Globe's not gonna run it. They're putting me on another story. - So what're they hiding? - I was hoping you could tell me that. This is fucked up, man. Tracksuit must have put them on it. Fuckin' Boylan. Hey, one flash behind. One flash behind you, baby. What are you doing here? I have some urgent questions for you, John. Jesus. Just walk right in. What questions? Know Wayne Cosgrove, reporter for the Globe? No, I don't know who that is. He showed me the tape. - What tape? - The tape of Gloria Weisnewski being murdered in the parking lot. The tape that you are burying. What tape? I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't play stupid with me. - I'm not playing stupid. - Not in your own home. - Don't talk to me like that in my house! - Are you drunk right now? - It doesn't matter. It's eight o'clock on a Saturday morning. Move along. Get the fuck out of our house! What happened to your wife's face, John? That is just... no way... What? Did you hit her with that... You're a filthy cop. You're a fuckin' disgrace. You beat that... Fuckin' hell! Shit. Get off of him! Get off of him, you son of a bitch. Spense! Stop! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Get off of him! Get off of him! That fucker over there killed a cat? So, the cat is what you're takin' away from all of this? Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna blow this whole shit open.

You looking for something, Officer? No, former officer. I'm just a concerned citizen now. Doing a little private investigating? I haven't really come up with the title yet for what I'm doing. Let me know if you hear anything germane to my investigation. What investigation is that, uh, Agent Louisa Burton? Use your imagination. You're the guy that got arrested for assaulting John Boylan. That's who you are. Gosh, damn it, that's who he is. Wow. Your partner's wound a little tight, huh? You know, no offense, but two top-dollar Feds tailing a dirty cop? I mean, what did you two do to fuckin' deserve this shit detail? See you later, all right? It's simple. The FBI does not solve crime, they manage them. They play some big abstract game, trying to trade-up for some vague masterplan, a big fish, which they never do. Meanwhile, all the victims, the innocents, - the Terrence Grahams of the world... - Hmm. ...they fall through the cracks. Right? There's zero justice, ever. So, where are we? We got Trinitarios, deal makin' FBI. Yeah. And we got some very corrupt cops covering something up. Well, maybe killing Boylan was a message. I know who we gotta go see. What the fuck do you want? You know that hit you tried on me? Who wanted that? Why is the FBI tailing dirty cops? What's going on in the city? I don't have anything to say to you. I figured you'd say that. Do you like movies, Squeeb? I got friends in here. I was able to bring in my phone. Henry, we're live. I... Let me... I don't know if I have this right. The fuck is that? - For Christ's sake. I got it... - Move your face away from the camera. - Yeah. Henry. - What? Move your face away from the camera. - You got video? - Yes. Are we really doing this? Yes. Now. Recognize her? Hey, is that my wife? It ain't mine. Hey, what the fuck? How long has it been, huh? How long you been in here? How long has it been since she's had some real attention? You see that handsome gentleman there? He met her in a supermarket. He asked her if she wanted to have a drink, she said yes. - Look how she's dressed. - Fuck you! No, look how she's dressed up. Three in the afternoon, she's dressed up like that? Wow. And you know what she had to do? She had to get a babysitter. That's a weird time to get a babysitter, huh? What are all the Aryan brothers gonna say about that? You better hurry up, Squeeb. She's already had four drinks. Fuck you. What the fuck do you want? I want answers, okay? Tell your friend to leave Suzie alone. Henry, tell Hawk to walk away. Okay, got it. Hey, Romeo, get outta there. What do you want? I know you know things, Squeeb. You got ears on the street. What happened to Boylan? Hmm? Who ordered the hit on me on my last day? I'll give you one word, man, one word only. Well, it better be a good word, amigo. Wonderland. What, you mean the dog track? What are you smiling at, Squeeb? I just keep imagining your head rolling down the sidewalk. You're fuckin' dead. Cosgrove, you in there? Who's there? Come on out. Where are you? Wonderland. They're building a casino there. It's gonna have the GNP of a small oil-rich nation. - And it's corrupt? - Well, yeah. I mean, ever heard of an honest outfit running a casino? I mean, they are, by design, instruments of corruption. If I was still a crime reporter and I wanted to get my head chopped off, I'd be writing about the connection between some dirty cops and some big politicians using the Trinitario drug trade to get a seat at the table of Wonderland. It's like some fuckin' evil partnership. It's got a name. Los Oscuros. Huh? The Dark. Cosgrove, if you know all this, why don't you just go public with what you have? Because the Wonderland syndicate has got enough money to bury anything I put out there. All right, picture this. Real bad cops, Dominican street gangs, and some of the dirtiest investors in the game, all working together to build the next great family-friendly resort destination for degenerate gamblers. What if I get you evidence? What? Real, undeniable evidence? I don't even know what that looks like. It would have to be some fuckin' visual to poke through this fake news bullshit. I'll tell you that. Okay? So, we done now? Because, honestly, this is the kind of conversation where a little red sniper dot pops up on my forehead. Hey, yo! - What's up? - Hey, you can't be here. No? I'm sorry, is this private property? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see a sign. I used to come here as a kid all the time with my grandfather. I thought it was reopening. I was hoping to see some dog races. Nah, no dogs in Massachusetts for 20 years. Oh, no, that's simply not true. I see dogs all the time in Massachusetts. In fact, I have one. Look at that. Her name's Pearl, huh? What a queen. I named her after my grandma. - Now you gotta get outta here. - Okay. - Come on. - All right. I'm sorry about that.

So, they all gather together one night to figure out what to do about this feral cat. So, one of the younger mice speaks up. Fire!

And I am very successful at it, all right? What did you expect? Punching bags? A bunch of grown men kicking each other in the fuckin' neck? - Go to Henry's for that. - Hey. - Leave my business out of it. - I expected more from you. You're supposed to be his mentor. Create an atmosphere of responsible thought and action. Instead, you got two grown men runnin' around playing Batman. We're not playing Batman, okay? This is Batman business all the way. Got you and big boy over here running through Boston all Robin-ed up. I am not Robin. And Alfred over here... Uh... Oh, Jesus. You are an enabling Alfred. You gave him the keys to the Batmobile. The Riv is not the Batmobile. Well, it serves the same purpose. Are we really gonna stay here? Because I'd rather take my chances with the Trinitarios. At least they don't talk so much. No. Because they're too busy trying to shoot you. You know, actually, they prefer machetes. Well, they're angry. Okay, well, I feel so much better now. So, I'm just gonna go. Let's go, boys. Snowball, Rosco, Smokey. Let's go. You hungry? Spenser? Did you call the police? No. And why would I? They probably did this. Hey. Are you a giant? Yeah. Are you a good one or a bad one? I'm a good one. Can you pull my bed over? I think I could handle that. I want you to put the pillow on the bed. Can you do that? Both pillows. Where would Terrence keep something if he didn't want anybody to find it? I don't know. Well, do you have any idea what they were looking for? What? Do you know what they were looking for? No, I don't. Why are you doing this? 'Cause it's the right thing to do. Terrence... mailed this to me the day he died. It's a wire. I know what it is. Did you listen to it? I don't know how.

Trinitarios are working for Bentwood. Bentwood works for Macklin. And they all work for Driscoll. They already know this. I need something concrete, Boylan. Come on, man. I'm on your side. Let me help you get the best deal out of this. Tell me about the Pony Express. I'll make it clear. Trinitario street gang and Tracksuit Charlie do the Pony Express once a week. You tell your fuckin' Feds to picture the biggest shipment of fentanyl and oxy that they can imagine. All right? And when they get that picture, tell 'em to triple it. Where and when? I will tell you that once I get my deal. Trinitarios are working for Bentwood. I swear to God, I didn't give anything! You're a rat, Boylan. Bentwood works for Macklin. Bad things happen to tattletales, don't they? And they all work for Driscoll. I didn't give them anything, I swear! This is my favorite part, you fuckin' rat. I see you got kara... Excuse me, karate, after school today, right? Yes, sir. You gonna be able to get yourself home from there? Yes. - I need you home by 5:00. - Yes, sir. - No later. - Yes. - 5:00 p.m. What time you comin' home? - 5:00. Please don't be late. Your mother's killing me about this, so... Stay right here. - Spenser. - Hey. What are you, lost? Nah. Just happened to be in the neighborhood. Okay. Okay. The fuck you doin' here, Spenser? I know about Wonderland, brother. I know you're in deep. You got any proof, Spenser? Yeah. Too much. You know, the good cop that I know, if he's still in... All right. Tell you what, I'm gonna give you one last chance to come clean about Wonderland. Cut a deal with the Feds, tell them the truth before more people get hurt. You do your time like a man, brother. Like I did. Be a hero for Josh. Get the fuck outta here. That's what I figured. You always were a hard-head. Just like me. Bye, roommate. Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.

It's hid in the refrigeration tanks. - When? - Tomorrow. - When? - Today! Noon. Which one? - What day do you meet, Charlie? - Today! Excuse me, sir. Are you okay? Oh, my God. You've got blood all over you. Let me see? No. Oh, shit. - You forgot one in the back. - I forgot one in the back? It's the driver's responsibility to check the back. Who makes these rules? Hey. Hey! Hey! You motherfuckers is dead. Shit! Fuck. You... You dead. Yous is dead. Oh, shit. Every single one of them is full. Huh? This is how the cops are buying their way into Wonderland. Jesus Christ! I haven't done drugs in 20 years. I don't even know what I'm lookin' at here. Fentanyl, oxy, coke. It's half the drugs in New England. Isn't this just gonna piss 'em off? Yeah, it's gonna piss 'em off once they end up in federal prison, absolutely. Uh, I don't know if it's enough. You don't know if it's enough? What is wrong with you? It's just a truck full of drugs! If I gave you a photograph of them smiling and holding it, - you'd say it wasn't authenticated. - No, that'd be good. - Yeah. - Them holding it? Huh? If I gave you a video tape, you'd say it was doctored. If I walked them into court with the drugs in their hands, you'll say they were coerced. You're unbelievable. Calm down. Sit! - Shit! - This is not good. That dude ID'd us. - Jesus Christ. - Jesus Christ, man... Ringo, what's wrong? What's wrong, baby? What is it, baby? What's up, baby? What is it, Ringo?

You know what Ringo here's job was before he retired? - Do you know what his main hustle was? - What? He was a narcotics dog. Bingo! Ringo. - Don't let that thing in here! - Oi! Oi! Go back inside. I need you guys... What the fuck is that? You brought drugs into my garage? Just do me a favor. Go back in the house with Henry. What did you do? Henry? Spenser! I told everybody to stay in the house. - Spenser! - Where's Henry? - He's not here. - Why is he not here? He... he wanted to go home. - He said he wanted to go. - I specifically told you to stay here! Why would you let him leave? What am I supposed to do? Chain him to the radiator? - Where is he gonna go? - He wanted to go home! Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding... Shit, he's FaceTiming me. Henry doesn't know how to FaceTime. Spenser. What do you want? I want us to sit down and talk and throw everything on the table. Work this out before... I have to kill Henry here. Hey. Don't touch him. You hear me? Do not touch him. These guys are a bunch of idiots, Spenser. - Spenser... - Put Driscoll back on. Fuck 'em. Hang up. He hit me in the eye. Where are ya? I'll come there right now. Wonderland. One hour. I'm on my way. And bring my drug shipment. What are we gonna do? You're with me? Okay. - Look. - Mmm. Wonderland is basically like an abandoned fortress. And there's pretty much only one way in, right here. It's the middle of the day. There's not a lot of places to hide. We're gonna have to get Henry out of the way. And I got a plan. It's a little unconventional. You're gonna have to trust me. No, no, no. No, you don't get the cool gun. Aw. Hawk is the name of a motherfucker with a shotgun. Spenser does your taxes. That was good. I'll give you that one. All right. You know, I'd really love to understand the process of why you took me as a hostage. Nobody's gonna come for me. I got about three minutes left in me. Nobody gives a shit if I live or die. I don't even care much if I live or die. You hit me in the eye. What you hit me in the eye for? I was sitting, minding my own business. You come in, I say, "Hello," and you hit me in the eye. - I gotta go to the bathroom. - Henry. - What? - Henry. I will gag you, old-timer. Gag me or not, I still gotta go to the bathroom. Who's running point on this shit-show? Get that fuckin' sword out of my face. Do you work at a Brazilian steakhouse? Are you kidding me? Where's Spenser? You degenerates. This is how you treat an old man, a poor mentally-challenged old man? - Let's go, Henry. - I'm not mentally challenged. Shut up, Henry! You're in shock. Come sit down. - You got a... - What're you doin' here? ...prostate the size of a grapefruit. - Come here. Just sit down. - Where's Spenser? Shame on you!

I gotta get to Driscoll. - Okay, go get him. I got you. - All right. He's over there! Oh, shit! Driscoll! Shit. Yo! That's how you throw a fuckin' punch! It's over. What, are you gonna shoot me? How did you kill Officer Terrence Graham? Huh? What'd you do? Wrap his hand around the gun, make it look like a suicide? You have your boys hold him still for you? I mean, cops killing cops? When did that ever become okay? Well... So, what are you gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do. You're goin' to prison. First, I'm gonna teach you a lesson. Yeah? What's that? Oh, a cop in prison's gotta know how to fight. You take my word for that. Let's go. Oh, let's. - I'm sick of your shit. - Come on. - You think you're special? - Let's go. Oh, you're not a fuckin' choirboy. You're a fuckin' jailbird! Fuck you! Fuckin'... I gave you a chance, brother. - Fuck your chance. - Fuck! You ain't got what it takes to make it in prison, you know why? 'Cause you're weak. Come on. Your stupid Serpico morality, it doesn't work in the real world. Mother... Come on, baby. Let's go. Yeah, baby. You were always so fuckin' naive! Huh? You thought you could help the victims? You ain't helping shit. Always some endless fuckin' need for sympathy. Oh, please, that's shit! You hear me? You ain't helping no one. Fuck. There's no justice, Spenser! There's only the strong and the weak. They gonna find your body wherever I dump it. They gonna put chalk around you, boy. You gonna die. Henry, too. And I'm gonna walk these motherfuckin' streets! Forever. You know what, bad guy? I'm gonna serve some justice today. I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest. You're under arrest.

A shocking turn of events have rocked South Boston. The FBI, in cooperation with the BPD, announced tonight that several top-ranking Boston police officers have been arrested on charges of corruption and racketeering. Chief among these charges is the framing of Boston Police Officer Terrence Graham.
