You have a great day. Bye! Hey, Mom. Hey, kiddo. How was town? Same old, same old. Got some fun shit though. Check this out. Oh! New look for the band maybe? I love it, man. That is sick! It's so cool. What else? I went to the record shop. Thought these looked cool. That's awesome. I can't wait to look through them. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I like making you happy. How about you? How was your day? It was good. I went hunting. For what? A laugh. But it was a ghost. Great food in the in the forest today. It looks good. Spring eats winter, winter eats fall. Fall eats summer, summer eats spring. Oh! Hi! Oh my God. Sorry, sorry to bother you. Woo, I am so lost! You're, you're trespassing. Understood. Oh my God, I've been hiking for hours. I, I parked on 209, and now I just can't find my way back. Do you know where 209 is? Is this your property? Yeah, I live here with my mom. You're a country girl, like my niece. Amber Hanson? She goes to school in town. I'm homeschool. Oh. Anyway, she lives like one mountain over, or one mountain over. She lives a mountain over. I gotta show you something. Look at this. Those don't work out here. If they did work, I wouldn't be so lost. I took a picture of something that was just super odd. Have you ever seen anything like this? I'm sick. Oh, you don't look sick. - I am. - Well, look at this. Hey! Pleased to meet you. Oh, fucking god! How the fuck? So, is that your daughter that I met? What's wrong with her? Do you know the Hansons? I was telling your daughter that my niece lives fairly close. I was thinking that maybe I could introduce them. I think they'd really get along. Are you married? No. Do you have any children? No. I would have liked to have kids though. Okay. I didn't get too close to him, I promise. Okay. You think I'm gonna be okay? You'll be fine. Hey! I see you, you big perve! AJ! I'm gonna fuck you up! Oh! You're not AJ. Sorry. I'm Izzy. Amber. I'm your neighbor. I live up on that mountain. Which mountain? That mountain. Well, that's news to me. You want a beer, neighbor? Well, are you gonna be creepy or are you gonna come over? Are you gonna sit the fuck down or what? I'm sick. What do you got, an STD? I'm just fuckin' with ya. Sit. I can't get close to people. None of us can. I'll sit. How come I've never seen you before? I'm homeschooled. Well, what do you do for fun? I hike. I draw. And swim, I swim. I'm in a band. Well, that's cool, what do you play? The drums. Oh, cool, I used to date a drummer. They're hot, but dumb. I sing, too. Nice. And I write the lyrics also. Damn, girl, what's your band's name? Hellbender. Wicked. You should come play at a part of mine sometime. That'd be so cool! Drink up. But don't piss in the pool. Liar! Mom.

About a mile down the road. It's not as nice. I've got some friends coming tomorrow, you should come. Okay. Bring a bathing suit this time. I don't have a bathing suit. I'll bring you one. You look like a cross between Kurt Cobain and a wet dog. Okay. See you tomorrow, Hellbender! See ya, Amber. I want to play out. What? I want to play out, for people. That's not gonna happen. Why not? I mean, we do all this and we're really good. I think that we should show people. Well, you know, we do it for us. It's our thing. 'Cause it's fun. I love playing with you, but I think it'd be fun to share our fucking amazing songs with other people. I think people would really like them. If a band plays in the woods and there's no one there to hear it, did the band really play? Izzy, what's going on? Nothing, I'm just. What if I'm better? You're not. You took me away from people when I was five. How do you know? I know that I don't want to take any chances. I love you too much. I love you, too. But I also love the idea of meeting other people who might like music as much as me, or something. You know? Maybe I could just have one friend. All I need is one.

I have an immune disease. Oh, which one? X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease. That's weird. I thought only boys got that, and it's super fatal passed infancy.

Tequila? In celebration of our new friend and her first tequila shot, I will place in one of these cups not the typical dead worm you'd find at the bottom of a bottle, but a real, live, bloody bodacious earthworm. Drink up. I'm vegetarian. You were vegetarian. Now, you're a worm-atarian. Oh, come on guys, leave her alone. I'll have the worm. No, them's the rules. You get the worm, you eat the worm. Come on, kid. It'll give you superhuman strength. Hold your nose, you won't even taste it. Hey! Oh my God. They never come up on weekdays! Dude, you forgot your clothes. And your fucking shoes. You wild woman! I'm gonna need that bikini back. Oh my God, you're so fucking screwed. Dude, I'm not gay. But I got friends you could meet. What the fuck, dude? Don't you ever fucking come near me again! Hey, you're fucked! I'm sick of you kids trashing my pool and breaking into my pool house! That is a vintage drum set! Look at me when I'm fucking talking to you! Are you stoned? Are you fucking high? Hello? Fucking pathetic. You're an idiot. You're coming with me and I'm calling the cops. Where have you been? I was with some friends. I ate a worm. A live worm. Are your friends okay? They'll be fine. I'm not sick. You're dangerous. My friend Amber's uncle's been missing for two days. Izzy. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna help you. Can we talk about what happened today? Hey! You're not gonna eat that, are you? No. 'Cause the hairs kind of get stuck in your teeth. Why did that worm make me so crazy? It wasn't the worm. It was the life in the worm. Magic comes from the fear, the fear of death. Every living thing has it. The more fear pumping through the blood, the more power. You think the worm gives you power? Try a rat. Or a dog, woo! Or a deer. It's all in the pumping blood. What happens if we eat... What? People. Then you'll know power. Is this a dream? Wow. I have never seen you like raspberry thorn so much. Your tastes are maturing. I shouldn't have said anything. Will you take a rainy hike with me? Sure. I shouldn't have kept this from you. It was a mistake. It's all right. Why did you? Keep you safe. From what? You've opened a door that once it's open, it can be hard to shut. But you only opened it a little, right? So, that's good. In fact, it's. It's great. It was bound to be open and I wish I was there. I should've been there. You're good, Izzy. You're good. I can help you keep it all in control. So, we're the same? Yeah. Was your mom like us? Well. She was, but she wasn't a good mother. And in the end, she might've wished she had been. So, can we leave the mountain now? No. Why, I'm not sick. Look, I'm gonna show you something, but you gotta promise no more door slammin'. Okay? Eat it quick while it's still alive. All right, show me what you got, kid. Holy shit. And that's why you can't leave the mountain. ♪ Yeah, I'm a mother fuckin' mountain ♪ ♪ Yeah, flowin' like a fountain ♪ ♪ I'm a make a ton, I'm a make a ton ♪ ♪ I'm a make a ton, I'm a make a ton ♪ ♪ I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit and run ♪ ♪ I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit and run ♪ ♪ I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit and run ♪ ♪ I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit and run ♪ ♪ I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit and run ♪ ♪ I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit and run ♪ Hey. Hey. What are you doing down there? I was just putting back some paint. I can hear you hearing me! Hey. Can I come in? Sure. You remember the friend you, uh, you made last summer? Amber? Yeah. You still friends? Do you ever see her? No. Is that because I'd forbidden you to or did something bad happen? The last time I saw her, she said that my friendship was kind of suffocating her. That's not your fault. But remember, Iz, we're not like them. We don't need them. We can be perfectly happy here, together. Alone. How come I'm the only one who's completely alone then? Well, we can work on that. When... When I'm not dangerous? Yeah. Dangerous to who? Whom? Hey, Iz, I'm going to town, do you need anything? No, thank you. Have fun. Hey, let's go to the ravine. Okay. Mom. Mom. Oh. More bones. What do you think did this? I don't know. I've been seeing a lot of bones lately. All stripped clean, like this. Impressive. Probably coyotes. Beautiful. But vicious. No, no, I. Whatever did this, it's neither right or wrong. It's just their nature. What is our nature? Our nature is dark. But I can teach you to starve it so it doesn't consume you. But you said whatever killed that deer back there, that was in their nature. You know why we're called hellbenders? Because we're powerful. And anything powerful is feared. Our ancestors grew drunk on that fear, they craved it. And so it was said we had turned our backs on heaven and bent towards hell. Do you want that kind of legacy? To be soulless? Unloved? Feared? Pop quiz. What happens when you mix huckleberries and tears? It enhances your eyesight. Okay, that's too easy. What if you crush spiderwebs and ivy. It makes your palms sticky so you can climb trees like squirrels. Awesome. It is. Where'd you learn this stuff? My mother. Anywhere else? No. Hey. What do you know about ferns? Nothing. Oh, such a beautiful plant. Self reproducing, like us. Awesome. It is. And if you've crush ferns and fungus with one other very special element, you can smell blood on the wind. Blood on the wind, I like that. But I need you to understand we don't need this kind of thing anymore. We're evolving. Okay. This is really fucking cool, do you want to try it? - Yeah. - Okay, good. What do you smell? A crow? A rabbit? I smell something big. Good. I smell a man. Hello! This is private property, you're trespassing. Actually, state land runs right along these rocks. That must be your property. Can I talk to you for a minute? How about 30 seconds? We're just leaving. 10 seconds, I'm a fast talker. All right, since we're short on time I'm gonna get straight to the point. Young lady, I need you to be totally honest with me. Where can I buy that shirt? There's only one. I made it for our band. 10 seconds. All right, business. I'm sure you all heard a man was killed last summer by a wild animal or wild animals couple of miles from here. It's my belief it's a rabid mountain lion. Have you guys noticed any carcasses? No. This might have something to do with the disappearance of a man. We found his car on 209, but no sign of his body. You see many hikers around here? Nope. Well, maybe it's a hellbender. What's a hellbender? It's kind of a cross between a witch, a demon, and an apex predator. They live off the fear that pumps through human blood, which gives them exceptional power. They've been around since the dawn of time, and they're still evolving. Young lady, if you don't become a designer, you should become a writer. All right, deal? All right, ladies. Take care of yourselves out there. Have a good one. A worm? You want to go back to moss and twigs? I mean, it's baby food. Why don't we eat a frog? Or a hedgehog? Or we can just go out for burgers.

But potent. They can't be that frightful though. Oh, they are the great death feeders of the world. Think about the lifecycle of a fly. A fly feeds on death, plants its eggs there, and then within that death comes rebirth, maggots, which then feed on death until they turn into flies. Then the whole cycle starts over again. How magic is that? And these babies were chowing on one of the deer I found in the forest, which looked like it came to a pretty terrifying end. Trust me, there is plenty to get ripped on. Try one. Let's fly. Come on, let's fly! It takes a lot more than maggots to fly, you greedy cunt! Then you can have your useless maggots! Oh my god! Bitch. Have you been in my dreams? We would make a great team. Oh, I don't feel so good. I need a shower. That was fun. Yeah, but we cannot do that again. That was very, very bad. Tell me about your mom. She was a monster. She ate half a village. They were children. My friends. She felt so guilty, she sewed her mouth shut. Did she starve to death? No. She was hanged. A waste of rope. So, then how'd she die? The way all hellbenders die. Spring eats winter, winter eats fall. Fall eats summer. How old are you? 147, I think. How old are you going to be? You tell me. Hey. What are you doing here? I just wanted to apologize. How, how did you know I work here? You're stalking me. - Fucking psycho. - Hold on, hold on. I just want to give you this. What is it? It's your bikini. Thanks. Thanks for letting me borrow it. No problem, hellbender. Sorry for being such a weirdo last summer. It's cool. Can you believe what happened to that guy? What guy? The guy who chased us. He got attacked by some wild animal. Oh. That's crazy. I was hoping nothing happened to you, even though you were being a nutcase. Well, thanks for the bikini. Oh, I almost forgot. I want to give you these. Barrettes? They're yours. I kind of stole them from you when I first met you at the pool. You know what, back the fuck off! Hey, Izzy! Iz? Hey, Mom! You want to hear something I wrote for Hellbender? Okay. There was a wolf who longed to be a sheep. So, she cut her claws and cracked her teeth. She buried deep the wolf beneath. And when she bore a cub, she raised it as a lamb. She cut its claws and cracked its teeth. She buried deep the wolf beneath. But when the lamb grew, so did her claws. So, did her teeth. And the wolf ate her mother who was just a sheep. You like it? Hey, did you meet my friend Amber? She's still alive and she's scared shitless. Cheers. Please! Help, help! Help me. Help! Fuck! Help, I wanna go home. Help. I can't, I can't move. Is she here? Please help. I can't move my body. Please help. Help. Help me, help me, help, help. Please help. Let me out, let me go! Don't let her do this to me. Please don't leave me. Don't leave me. Please don't leave me! Please, help me please. Hey, Mom, that's my friend Amber. Remember, we met her uncle in the woods that day. I think you dusted him. Ooh, I like that trick. It's a great one to do right in front of people. It just fuckin' paralyzes them with fear, like Amber. I saw you take a taste. - No. - Izzy... What, what have you done, what? What is this place? My happy place. I'm not gonna let you kill this girl. I'm gonna save her so I can save you. Save me from what? Izzy, I just wanted to save you from the hell that I've known. I just wanted us to be... Please! People. People? Like the people you've kept me from? Like Amber? The people that believe in good and evil? God and the devil? If they want to believe in hell so badly, I'll give 'em hell. Let me go! Izzy, you're good. I raised you to be good. Not evil. I saw the book. The blood, the bodies, the babies, the terror. I listened to your secrets and I watched your dreams. I know the truth, Mom. I did what I was taught to do. And you denied me that right. Right. To be a tool for the hands of hell. It's not a gift, Izzy. Then why was it given? I know the only way a hellbender can die. Winter eats fall, fall eats summer, summer eats spring, and spring eats winter. Did your mother sacrifice herself or? I think I know. Watch out, Mom. You might turn into a real hellbender. I know you're in there. Show me. Let me see. There you are. You're so beautiful. Thank you. Now, it's my turn. I'm not afraid of you, Izzy. You will be. Help, please help me. Don't, I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not, don't. Mom, I'm not gonna eat you. I'm not ready to have a little hellbender. And I love you. I'm going to town, you need anything? Bass strings. You got it.
