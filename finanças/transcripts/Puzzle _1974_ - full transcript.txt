(anxious ensemble guitar music) (woman singing in foreign language) - Look Peter, I told you. Trying to force your memory hour after hour for weeks on end isn't going to get you anywhere. - I can't just sit around waiting for it to happen. Everyone that I meet, everywhere I go, every shop, every street, I wonder, do I know this place? I think, could this man know who I am? - You mustn't ask yourself these questions, forget about them. - I can't forget them. It's like eight months ago I was born in that clinic, the one where I woke up. It's depressing. - The human mind is a mysterious organ, Peter and you've got to relax it, don't torture it. You shouldn't try to force it into revealing the past to you and in a few months or so, you'll get total recall again. - Sure, easier said than done. I get up every morning and I go to work and I eat and I sleep but who am I, doc? Who, who, who? The man who had a bad car accident? There must be something else. Don't I have at least a few friends, a family, somebody? - Of course you have, Peter. (siren blaring) - Hi, doc. Ted. - Am I supposed to know this man, Doctor? - Well you should, yes. - How do you do? - Well it's me, Philip. Don't you remember me? - Before we talk of other things, who the hell am I? (fist thuds) (Peter groans) - I'll tell you who you are. You're a dirty son of a double-crosser. A two-bit con artist who thinks he can pretend that he's lost his memory. Well I'll get it back for you. - No, hold it, hold on. - Ah. Got it back already, have you? - No. You may not believe me but it's the truth. Look, tell me everything from the beginning, it might help. - I don't believe you but we'll do it your way. - You say my name is Ted but I've got a passport that says my name is Peter Smith. - So you even had yourself a passport forged, did you? Where were you planning to go? - Philip, I woke up over eight months ago in a clinic and before that, before that, the past is a mystery. - All right, buddy. Your name is Ted Walden and you were born 30 years ago here in jolly old England at Brockhurst in Kent. You lived here on the continent and in New York. You got married two years ago to an American. - Married? You sure about that? - Yeah. - Where's my wife then? - In Portofino, Italy, where you left her. Now then buddy boy, you tell me where the- (glass shatters) (anxious flute music) (doorbell buzzing) - Coming. - Telegram for you, sir. - Thank you. (mysterious ensemble music) What the bloody hell's going on? So I've got a wife called Sara and a dead man on my hands, Jesus. - Mr. Smith. There's a letter for you, sir. - Thank you. - Pleasure, sir. (anxious flute, piano music) (gunshot booms) (water splashing) (spectators shouting) - Hey Sara, I won! Did you see? I won the race! - I'm the winner. - No, you're not. I saw what you did, you should be ashamed. You were disqualified. - But he should have done the breast stroke and he was doing the crawl. - That does not justify pushing him under the way you did. It's disgraceful. - Well, he should have done the breast stroke. - Two wrongs don't make a right. - He did it wrong. - It doesn't make any difference, now, go and get changed. - You do not order me around, I'm not your son. In fact, I am your fiance. Wait for me outside and I'll take you home and next time, make sure everyone does the breast stroke. (relaxed guitar music) You watch, today he won't come. - What do you bet he will come? Cinque. Quattro. Tre. Due. Uno. - Sorry, late again. - We could have done all right without you. - Don't start that business again. - Climb aboard, Portofino next stop. - Thanks. Did you have a lot of work today? - Not really. - Liar. - Bone crunchers only work in winter when there are skiers around. - Wish you were right, Othello. - Luca, Luca! I've already told you, you mustn't call me Othello. You always do, I am sick of it! - He's only joking darling, now get in the car. - No, I'll take a bus, I prefer it. - Hey come on, get in. Hurry up or you'll get left behind. (relaxed ensemble violin music) You know Luca, I appreciate you letting me give your girl a ride home. - She's not my girl but she's not yours either. - Oh Luca, you little rascal. - Around the rugged rug- - The ragged rascal ran. - So one has to be rude to get a kiss from you, Sara, huh? - No, you have to be 10 years old. - How about a song, Luca? (singing in foreign language) (car horns blaring) - Thank you for the ride home, sir. You really are an angel. - So have I earned a drink? Angels are incorrigible drunks, you know. - You meant teetotalee. - The word is teetotaler, professor. (moaning) (camera clicks) See you tomorrow, Luca. - I know when I'm not wanted. - I think you'd better gone home too. - Why? - Well, I've got some things to do around the house. - I've heard that one before. All right, tomorrow at 10:00 but don't be late. I have some bone crunching to do, as your fiance calls it. - At 10:00 then. You're not jealous of Luca, I hope. - Do I have the right? - Ciao, Reinhardt. - Ciao, Sara. - Sara, if you're afraid to be alone in the house, I could stay with you for awhile. - No, I'll be all right, thanks. You live nextdoor, so I can scream for help through the window if I need it. Goodnight, Luca. - Nana. Nana. - Luca, go and wash, we'll be eating in a minute. (Whiskey barking) - Whiskey. Oh, sorry baby. I forgot all about you. And you wanna go out, hmm? Come on then. Five minutes in the garden. There you go, I'll leave the door open. (soft ensemble music) (door slams) (Whiskey growls) (Sara humming) (Whiskey barking) Whiskey. I left the door open for you. (anxious violin, flute music) Well, I thought I did. Come on then. (Whiskey whimpering) (tense violin music) (Whiskey growling) Whiskey, what are you doing under there? What's wrong, huh? You're behaving very badly tonight. You've had supper. What is it, you want a drink, hmm? All right. We'll go get a drink, hmm? (soft anxious ensemble music) (tense sharp violin tones) (Whiskey whimpering) (light switch clicks) (Sara sighs) (soft ominous chanting) (soft anxious guitar, flute music) (light switch clicking) Whiskey? (window rattles) (soft ominous chanting) (anxious violin music) (bell ringing) (Sara gasps) (glasses rattling) (soft anxious ensemble music) (phone beeping) (tense guitar tones) - Did you check all the house, Senora? - Yes. - Nothing's missing, not a thing. It's all just thrown around, nothing was taken. - Like a month ago. It seems to me somebody just likes to mess up your house for you. - The only difference is I wasn't in last time. - But you admit, you left the door open, Senora. - Right, but I do that often. - The strange thing about it, he's obviously not a thief. - So what do you call someone who sneaks in, attacks me, kicks the dog and destroys the house, a gentlemen? - No, not at all, my dear. I'll have the house watched for awhile. (gate creaks) (camera clicking) (chainsaw buzzing) - Vittorio, when you finish, put the saw on the cupboard. Don't leave it on the table. - Very good, Senora. Oh dear, sorry. - Excuse me. - Buongiorno. - Buongiorno. - Good morning. - Ciao. - How are you? - Fine, only I sure I hate this weather. I've never known such a rainy May. - Would you like a coffee? - Love one. - How about seeing a film tonight? - That's a good idea, what's showing? - I don't know, we can find something. We can go to Genoa if necessary. - All right. - A telegram for you, Senora. - For me? - Here, I'll take it. - Thank you. (soft anxious guitar music) - Is it bad news, Sara? - No. It's from my husband. It's a bit surprising, that's all. - Oh, what does he say? - He's coming back here to join me. He's been away nearly a year. Disappeared in London. And now this. "Arriving today at 3:30, meet train if you can, Ted." - You want to be there, I suppose. (train rattling) (train horn blares) - I feel confused, Reinhardt. I'm angry at him as well but I still want to see him and talk to him. - You once said you hoped you'd never see him again. - Yes I know, you're right. Only you know how a woman reacts when a man's left her. And I realize I want to see him. Reinhardt, I'd rather be alone for this, do you mind? - Yeah. It'd be better. (both chuckling) - Ciao. - I get the very distinct impression that you're still in love with him. (train brakes squeaking) (mysterious ensemble guitar music) - Your wife's still standing at the top of the stairs. (relaxed violin tones) - Sara? - I can't believe it, you simply looked straight through me. - I can explain, Sara. - I might as well be a total stranger. - Please listen. I have amnesia. - I don't want to hear it. - I had a car accident. - Is this some kind of an excuse? - Really, I've been ill for months. I can explain, can we go somewhere quiet? - We'll go to my house. You said a car accident? - That's right. It's nice to find I have such a beautiful wife. (Sara chuckles nervously) And that's how they found me in the wreckage of the car. It was rented in the name of Peter Smith, my name. At least that's what it says in the passport. The police did a lot of research but they couldn't come up with anything. Peter Smith, stateless, no parents, no friends and that's all I really know. - Well to start with, your name's Edward Walden, Ted to your friends. We met in New York a year and a half ago at the Guggenheim and we both fell for each other, love at first sight. Mean anything? - No. - A week after we met, we flew out to London and got married there. But in London, we didn't see very much of each other. I spent all day alone in the hotel while you were off somewhere working. - What kind of work was I doing? - I don't know, you never told me about what you were doing. It was secret. I only know, well you appeared to have a lot of interest in antiques. - Nothing more? - Nothing more. A month later, I came here to Portofino, knowing that within a week or so, you'd join me. We'd arranged with Peggy Cole to rent your house for a couple of years. Ted, you knew Peggy. She's an old friend of mine, remember? You met her in London. You just disappeared then. Flew into the sunset. I never heard any more of you. - But who am I and what am I? - A dirty rotten bastard. - Well, everyone seems to agree on that. (phone ringing) (speaking foreign language) - Ciao, Reinhardt. Yes, fine, thanks. Yes. All right. Goodnight. Yes and thanks, Reinhardt. Don't worry about him. He's just a friend. I teach swimming now and he's a doctor at the sports center. - Quite a few people have called me a dirty rotten bastard. Is that how I was in this photo? - No, but that was taken only three days after our marriage. - Then why did you leave it out? - Loneliness is no fun. - Are you telling me? You knew where I was. Why did you take so long before sending me this telegram? - What telegram? It wasn't me who sent you this. - I should get away from here then immediately. - Why? - Because this means they've arranged our meeting and whoever they are, they're killers. So you see, it's really safer for both of us to separate again. - No, stay here. I'd be frightened alone. There's a spare room upstairs where you could sleep, Ted and you're welcome to use that at least until- - Until? Maybe I never will get better again. You know what my doctor said? That it's me who doesn't want to remember anything. Of course I've tried but it's useless, Sara and the more I try, the worse it gets. Or at least no better. The doctor says I'm scared, scared of what I'd remember. (clock chiming) (anxious ensemble flute music) - You remember something, Ted, what is it? Does it have to do with the clock? - I don't know. Could be. I had an impression of something but then the image just faded. - You bought it for me in London as a wedding gift. It was so expensive and I thought you were totally crazy but you insisted on getting it. You said that it was a symbol of good fortune. That it would keep our love secure for always. - I guess I was wrong. - I'm not so sure. We might try beginning at the top. - Really, is that what you want? All right. As from tomorrow, I begin courting you and I'll sweep you off your feet again like I did in New York, all right? Do you want a drink? - Yes, give me some Port. - Port, huh? I should have known what to give you, right? - No. Up until the time you disappeared, I never drank. Then the loneliness got to me and I began to drink a little Port every now and then. - Here. - Ted, listen. I truly, truly want to, well, believe your story. - But I'm a dirty rotten bastard and I might be pretending I've lost my memory. Is that why you want me to stay here? To keep an eye on me, to find out if I'm lying? - My god, no, no. I asked you to stay here because I really want us to, well, oh, you shouldn't have to ask such questions. (soft violin, piano music) This is Whiskey and he's my best friend. (Whiskey barks) - Hey fella, you've put on a bit of weight. All right, off you go. The trouble is they eat too much pasta. - The trouble is that I love pasta. - Well take care. Once it's on, it's very difficult to take it off. (water splashing) - Haven't you two met each other yet? - Daniele. - Nice to meet you. Sara's talked a lot about you. - Nothing bad, I hope. - Be careful, you'll catch cold. - You came down from London? - That's right, I- - I know, you arrived on the train yesterday afternoon, right? - That's right, yes, who are you? - You mean Sara hasn't talked about me? I'm Luca. - Oh now Sara, you didn't tell me about Luca. - Can I take Whiskey for a walk? - Yes, he'd like that but don't let him run too much, will you? Well now. - Hey, aren't you gonna get dressed? - Yes, of course. I won't take a minute. (anxious ensemble music) - Tell my wife I'll wait for her outside. (bird wings fluttering) (fist thuds) - Still the same old violent Ted. - Why are you following me? - Still playing that game, huh? I'm George. - You can stick your hand in your pocket until you've answered my question. - We were real good buddies once, before you went and lost your memory. - That's the point, it's the truth, George. That's why I've got to ask questions. Was it you who arranged for me to come here? - I guess you could say that. Look Ted, quit playing the amnesia act. It'll go better for both of us if we make a deal. - You've given me half an answer. Try not to be so vague about it. - Look Ted, Philip didn't go for this story of your amnesia. He believed you were just a bastard trying to screw us. - And what do you think? - I'm inclined to believe you're a bastard who, having already screwed us, bashed his head and can no longer remember how it was he screwed us. But Philip didn't agree. - And you murdered the man for this? - I was saving your life, buddy. - Thanks a million. It's beginning to make sense. - He could have killed you. - You're saying- - After he got the information. - I was once a part of your group. - Yeah, you sure were. You were the key to the whole operation and we ain't gonna let you get away with it. - Get away with what? - $1 million, Ted. And it's up to me to collect it or I'm a dead duck. - Listen, if you're telling the truth, then I want to know all of it, details, everything. The whole story. - It is the truth and I'll tell you the whole story soon. Oh look, you better have this. I'd burn the other one if I were you. Peter Smith left a corpse in London. - Ah, so it was you who sent me that false passport? - Oh no, you had that one made to double-cross us. - Ted. Ted. - Run along, see if your lovely wife can help. - I'll kill you if you even try to bring Sara into this. - Well, that's a good start. You're getting back into character again. - Ted, what happened? I've been waiting a quarter of an hour. - I'm sorry, darling. - Where were you? - I went for a walk and got lost. (waves crashing) (camera snaps) - Whiskey? Whiskey? Whiskey? Whiskey? Whiskey? (relaxed violin music) (woman singing in foreign language) Whiskey! Whiskey, where are you? (relaxed ensemble music) - This is the most beautiful place in the world. - We talked about it all the time in London, remember? No, of course you don't. - Even more beautiful is that we're here together. Well, it wouldn't matter where we were. What's important is being with you. - Being together again is a completely new experience. It's difficult to explain but well, your face is the face of the man I loved. You have his body, his hands but it's only a shell that cover someone I don't really know, a new personality. - Do you like him? - Let's say I don't dislike him. (relaxed violin music) No, not yet, Ted. - I'm sorry, that was stupid of me. I forgot that you probably have a romantic attachment here and I guess it's natural enough. - Who are you thinking of, Reinhardt? Well it's nearly a year that you haven't shown the slightest concern for me. - That's a bit unfair of you. - There's no one else, Ted. No one to worry about. I admit I've gone around with Reinhardt for months. But he's a friend, that's all. A good friend and I needed him. - I'm glad that you haven't been alone. But maybe now that I'm here, you won't need anybody else but me. - I want you to get well, to start remembering again. But I want you to stay as you are, as the person you are now. - You have got to admit- - Whiskey! - Plays a very good game. - Whiskey! - And sometimes brilliant. - Si, but he is a prima donna. - So what? He may be a prima donna but he scores and that's the main thing. Hey Luca, where are you off to? - I've lost Whiskey. - Well, don't worry. Maybe he went home by himself. - I know but he may have been run over by a car. - Hey calm down Luca, it was just an idea. - Based on what evidence? - Very smart. All right Luca, let's go look for him. (anxious violin, flute music) (relaxed drumbeat) (soft guitar, violin music) (Sara screams) (tense violin tones) - Sara, what is it? - Oh Ted. They killed Whiskey. (tense ensemble tones) (coughing) (anxious guitar, piano music) - I can't. - My God, Ted, why would anyone want to murder a little animal like Whiskey? - I don't know what came over me. I expect it was all that blood. - I don't think it was that. What was it you remembered, what was it? - Nothing, I got a cramp. I react to blood that way. - If you don't trust me, we shouldn't be together, Ted. - I think I saw a killing. - What do you mean a killing? - I got this image that I was watching a man's throat being cut. - Sara. Sara. - May I come in? Senora, Luca is worried, Whisky disappeared. - Somebody killed him, Sergeant. - Where is he? - He's upstairs in the bed. No Luca, you stay down here. - He ran away. It wasn't my fault. - Don't worry. My husband, Sergeant. - How do you do? - Pleasure. - You're not to worry about it. It wasn't your fault, Luca. A crazy person did it. - Call me if I can help at all, won't you Sara? - You're already being a help, Luca, just by being a good friend. - All I can tell you Senora is that they cut his throat with a very sharp instrument. Most probably a razor. It has to be the work of a sadist or a madman I think. No one in their right mind would do a thing like that. Do you want me to dispose of the body? - No. I'd rather bury him in the garden. Poor Whiskey. He was such a sweet dog. Always trusting and friendly. - They're getting at me through you. That's why they killed him. I warned him not to do it. Well now the bastard will pay. (anxious violin tones) - Ted. Ted. - Stay in the house. (singing in foreign language) - Ted. Hello, sweetheart. - Who the hell are you? (door creaks) (door slams) - Take it easy, baby doll. I'm a friend of your husband's. - Get out or I'll start screaming, I mean it. - Why? I just came by to visit for awhile, that's all. You see, I want to help Ted. - Why? - Well, it's like this. If he doesn't get any help, then he'll be dead one week from this evening. He and I together and if you're gonna be killed, a week becomes the equivalent of half a minute. - What do you mean? Somebody's gonna kill Ted? - Ah, no, no, no, no yelling or poof, I'll go. - No, don't go, please, I won't yell again. Tell me about it, will you? - Fair enough, Ted has to pay off a debt directly to me and if he doesn't pay me, then I can't pay the others. These others have been very patient and waited eight months already and now they've run out of patience. - You want money. You should have said so earlier. How much does he owe you? - A million dollars. (Sara scoffs) - Now how on earth could Ted ever come up with a million dollars? - Here in his head. It's all in his head. Now he says he can't remember. Whether it's true or not isn't important at all. What is important is that he gives me the cash or the merchandise or tells me where he's hidden it at least. - His memories are blank, it's true. He really is very ill. He didn't recognize me even when he came here. - Well if he's ill, he's got seven days to get better again. I wanted to tell you exactly how things were in the hope that you can help him to get back to normal. Help him to remember what he's forgotten, help him stay alive. Because I warn you Sara, before they kill me, I'll cut his throat and yours. - The same as my dog. - Don't tag me with that one, honey. I don't kill dogs, my hassle is with two-legged animals. - Our mutual friend says there's at least one thing you should remember, New York. - New York? - Mm hmm. - Ah yes, it's in America, isn't it? - Two names and address in New York. - I just can't remember. - You've got to try, please. - Who's this mutual friend? - If I end up telling you everything, what's the point? - Nothing I guess, but who knows? It might be helpful to have a few of the answers. - My job is just to give you a message. Think about New York. (gate creaks) - I saw this man I know but I never did find him. - Why have you been so long? - I chased him as far as the court and he disappeared, so I searched around. - Who was it? - The fellow who got me over here. The one who was at the station. The one who says his name's George. - What does he want from you? - Beyond me. Something to do with my past probably. - Why don't we go away from here? - To New York, for example? - Yes, or London. Any city with a few million people to hide in. (relaxed violin, piano music) - No. No, please Ted, I can't. (relaxed ensemble guitar music) (thunder booming) (tense screeching tones) (ominous chanting) (door rattles) (door squeaks) (ominous chanting) (glass shatters) (anxious violin, flute music) (thunder booming) (tense screeching violin tones) (glass shatters) (Sara screams) (wind howling) (door slams) (tense violin tones) (Sara screams) - Sara. Sara. - Oh, Ted. - What's wrong? - Ted. - What's the matter? - Someone was in here. - What is it? It's all right now, I'm here. (ominous ensemble tones) - Was it really necessary to kill him? - That's a silly question where a million dollars is involved. - You had the right idea, Sara. We've got to get out of here. (door slams) - Yes, good. Try the Saldano now. - When are you leaving? - A couple of days. - Why go with him? - Ted has to leave and a woman goes where her husband goes, Luca. - Bullshit. - Hey now, let's try to be a little pleasant, huh? - What language, Luca. Have you made any plans for tomorrow in the afternoon? - Nothing in particular, have you Sara? I'll go to the pool. That way I can say goodbye to everyone. - Excuse me sir, there is a man at the bar who wishes to speak with you. - I'll be back in a second, I hope. - I don't understand, he said he was going to wait here. - Who, the Senor dressed in blue? - Si. - He went into the toilet. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - You're welcome. - What happened to bring this up? - Ted has to leave, that's all. - For how long? - I don't know. (soft piano music) - You should understand by now. She's in love with her husband, no? - You stay out of this. - I just thought maybe you didn't understand. - Where are you going? - To America, probably New York but we haven't decided. - Let's quit kidding around. The stuff, where is it, buddy? - What stuff? - I don't want to hear any more of your smart wise cracks or I'll put a slug in your amnesia. My patience is stretched as far as it'll go. If you'd left the stuff hidden anywhere in London, you wouldn't have come here, not even if you'd received a telegram from the President of the Republic. - Right. - So that means the stuff's here and to bring it over here, there's only one person you would have trusted it with, only one, your wife, Ted. Now who gets it first, your wife or you, buddy? - Let's recap a minute. You say I've hidden this stuff worth a million dollars. Exactly what is it, George? - A string of sausages full of pure heroin. 15 pounds of hard merchandise that'll fetch us at least a million in New York. - That much, huh? - So what happened? - Oh, Senor Gomez, they couldn't make a decision but I guess I'll work out. Morning. - Morning. - Can't you influence them? - Influence that batch? Not a hope and besides, it's not that important to me. So why should I waste my time? - This is terrible news, Sara. - It was a very sudden decision. It was quite a shock even for me, I'm sorry. - Such a pity. You got on so well with the children, they all love you. - Please, would you say goodbye to them for me? I hate partings. - Sara. - Reinhardt, hi. - I came by as usual to pick you up. It could be the last time, who knows? - I'll be ready in a minute. - It's fine. - Was I very long? - Ah. No time at all. The Guinness Book of Records may even accept it. I parked in the piazza. Listen, I don't want to lose contact with you. Will you send me your address in America? - Sure, as soon as we're through moving around. - Darn it, have you got any cigarettes with you? - No, I hardly ever carry them. - Why don't you check in your bag? Maybe we'll be lucky. - I know I don't. - I'll have to go get some, do you mind waiting while I- (Sara screams) - Sara! - God. Don't move Sara, just lie still. - My god. - What the hell were you doing? - I check the mirror- - Don't touch her. - Before I backed up and I didn't see anyone. - What do you mean you didn't see anyone? - I am so sorry. - We're not invisible. - Do you want me to call a doctor? - No, no, don't worry, I'm a doctor. Just help me up with her. Give us a hand, will you? - I'm so sorry. If there's anything I can do. If you want to use my car. - Let me see your insurance. You all right, Sarah? - Yes. - Open the door, please. - Of course. - But it's pretty painful, I must admit. - There you go. All right, come on. - Slowly. - In you go. - There we are. - Thank you. - Sit down first, there. - And here Senora. Here we are. - Thank you very much. - Well? - Here my insurance details. I'm sorry about all this. - We'd better put in a full report. Now move your car, please. Clean break of the tibia, dislocated kneecap. Well, it could have been worse, much worse. - Right, then on the other hand, it could have been better. - Oh, well it depends on how you look at it. I feel we're lucky, I've seen the most terrible fractures caused by a simple fall. - The main thing now is when are we gonna be able to think about traveling? - Oh, I think if you give the cast a couple of days to harden and of course take it easy, you'll be able to leave. - Two more days. - Crutches and all. - And that American girl, the one who was driving, what do we do about her? - Ah yes, well I've got all the insurance details and I've got friends in the business who will take care of it. You won't even have to talk to her. - I just can't imagine what we'd have done without you, Reinhardt. - You would find another bone cruncher to plaster your leg. - Hey, let's have a little respect around here, young man. You want some more, darling? - No thank you, it's already gone to my head. - Well go on. - I'd be drunk. - You're not going anywhere. You can get as drunk as you like. - Hello, Sye Insurance, the manager, please. - Nice shots. - Is that what they lean to? - Sure, it's a leg. - No, those are just painkillers. Not more than three a day, all right? The other things are vitamins and calcium to help the bone heal. - Let's hope we can get the same bottles in the States. - I'll give you a ring soon. - Can I come with you? - Yes, sure Luca, a chemist isn't too interesting. - What's a chemist? - A pharmacist. (classical violin music) (door rattles) - Ted? You didn't take any money along, did you I bet? - You bet wrong. - Ted isn't here right now. - Oh, I know. That's a beauty, ain't it? Tough luck, just when the two of you were planning to run off. If you'd made it, you might've lived a little longer I guess. Now you're right back where you were with five days left. Just five short, five short days spent sitting right here. - Look, my husband's never stolen anything from anyone. He's just a victim, a victim of this whole rotten affair. Don't you realize he'd tell you what you want to know if he could? - He'll get around to it. - Be careful. No please, what are you doing? You're mad. - He better in the next five days because if he doesn't, as I told you, I'll cut both your throats. - Stop it. No more, please. - What I want looks like a big string of sausages. - Don't. - A big string of white sausages. - No please, oh God, no more. No more. - When I said I'm gonna kill you in five days, I meant it. This is just the beginning. I want you to die. - Go away. - Little by little. - Please. Please. No more. No more. - Enjoyable little game, isn't it? I saw it in a film once, very effective. Oh, tell Ted I want to see him tomorrow at that villa across the bay at noon with the stuff. (Sara weeps) (classical violin music) - Yeah, in rugby, you pass it like this. So now you know. See you tomorrow, Luca and thanks for the company. - Goodnight, Ted. Are you gonna make dinner this evening? - Well, I suppose I'll have to, ciao. - Ciao. (Luca gasps) You scared me for a second. Nana. - Sara. - Ted. - What's wrong? - He was here again. - Who was here again? - The one who says his name is George. He was here the other day. - What do you mean he was here before? Why didn't you tell me? - I don't know Ted, I don't know why I didn't. He wanted to talk to see if I could find out anything, to ask your questions. He was quite nice that day. Then he came back today because he heard we were leaving. Tomorrow he wants you to come to the abandoned old villa across the bay, to be there at noon and to bring along the stuff. - How can I? - Even if you can, you mustn't go. He'll kill you, I know he will, he's mad, Ted. Apart from that, the villa can be reached only by the one road. So he'll be able to see you long before you get there to ambush you. - Come off it, Sara, I'll be all right. I may have lost my memory but I'm not stupid, darling and I'm not as scared of George as he is of me, you know? It's just a bluff, it's a put-on. Look, if he's convinced I know where the stuff is, he won't kill me, you know? What would be the point? - He'd enjoy it. Besides, he's already threatened to kill us if you don't give him the drugs. (coughing) (low anxious piano music) - How do you plan to get the stuff out? - Your suggestion yesterday was perfect. - I got all your medicines, so you should start taking- - You must remember where you've hidden it. I'm sorry but... - Sorry for what? I didn't want you to be involved in this in any way. You've already been brought into it and I'm sorry about that. It's something I've got to do alone. - Just be careful, he's not fooling around, Ted. - I know. (anxious metallic tones) (anxious ensemble music) (brakes screech) (boat engine rumbling) (anxious ensemble guitar music) (doorbell rings) - Who is it? - It's me, Luca. - Oh, just a minute, I'll be right there. Ciao Luca, how are you? - I am very fine. I am sorry I made you get up. - Oh, don't worry. It's good exercise for the rest of me. Anyway, my leg doesn't hurt anymore. - That's good. - Give me that blanket, would you Luca? - Yeah, sure. Here. - Thank you. What's that? - My photographs. - Your work, huh? - Would you like to see? - Yes, I sure would. Let's see. Where are they? - It's upside down. - Ah, here we are. Oh, that's a very pretty one. I'm really surprised. You're very good, Luca. I remember you taking those. - It's better to make pictures when people don't know it. - But why have you only got photographs of me? - Later on, there are other people. There's Reinhardt too, so he can no longer say I'm always jealous. And anyway, I don't think you'll miss your Lothario when he will go away. - Oh really, what makes you think that? - You'll see this picture, otherwise I won't say anything. It's a picture of feminine girl, a blonde girl. I'd say she looks American. (mysterious ensemble tones) - When did you take this? - The other day. Remember, we all ate lunch in the restaurant? (anxious violin, guitar music) - Was it before I had the accident? - Yes, while you were swimming, I took it and then he went along to meet you. - I'm right on time, George. - I don't agree, Ted, you're eight months late. - Put it back. - Well, where's the stuff? - I tried to think, George, but all I get is a blank. - You're never gonna get away with it, Ted. You ain't gonna leave me in a pile of shit. I think that crazy story you told me that you lost your memory is bull but even if you weren't lying, you forgot about one thing, if I gotta die, then first of all, I'm gonna kill you and that whore of a wife of yours- (thudding) (grunting) This is where I give you yours, Ted. - The thing is he had to have a reason for not letting on that they knew each other. It's rather strange. I mean why'd they have to go through that act as if they'd never seen each other? It shouldn't, but it worries me a bit. Hello, is this Sye Insurance? This is Sara Walden. I was knocked down two days ago. A car, a young lady, she was carrying your insurance. Mary Kane. - Just a moment, please. - What do you think is wrong? - I am very sorry, Senora, but we have no Mary Kane listed. - But that's impossible, really. Listen, a Dr. Langer went to your office yesterday. The x-rays of my leg for verification and a declaration signed by the other Senora. But he telephoned you in front of, he telephoned you in front of me. Thank you. (waves crashing) - You want a couple more minutes to say a prayer, Teddy? - I swear to you, George, if I really knew where I put that heroin, It'd be here now but I can't remember. - Then I've got to kill you. Back up. Go on. (waves crashing) - Come on then, kill me, go ahead. You need help to pull the trigger? - Just get up on the wall. By killing you, Ted, it's myself that I am killing. But before they bury me, I'm gonna kill your wife. (gunshot booms) (grunting) (thudding) (George screams) (water splashes) (waves crashing) (fist thuds) - It's tough. - Why not get a doctor to get it off? - Because Luca, I don't want anyone else touching it. I may be wrong but then I may not be. Damn. - What's the matter? - Nothing Luca, nothing. (door creaks) - Rest well, Ted. - But who are you? - I'm a mutual friend. Now that you've killed George, we can go to New York together. I have the stuff and you have the name of the buyer, so we can split 50-50 as agreed. - All right, all right but in that case, let me loose. - Patience Ted, patience. You've just killed a man and you say you've lost your memory. I don't want to run any risks. - That doesn't mean a thing, nobody saw me. Besides, it was self-defense and as for remembering, I'll remember if I have to. - You always were a clever son of a bitch. So tell me if you can remember, who am I? Tell me my name and I'll untie you. - Your name is that of a killer. Isn't that right? - That's right but you don't know it. So I'll come back later and we'll see how your memory is doing then. (Sara and Luca grunting) (boat engine rumbling) (tense ensemble music) - You cut yourself. - It's nothing, Luca. - I'll fix it. Where's the alcohol? - In the kitchen I think, the right-hand cupboard. (fan creaking) (ominous violin, trumpet music) (anxious chiming tones) - How do you plan to get the stuff out? - Your suggestion yesterday was perfect and then Sara can bring it over via Italy. - My leg wasn't ever broken. (ominous violin music) - What's that? (tense guitar music) (fan crashes) - The base of this clock is a perfect hiding place. The base of this clock is a perfect hiding place. Don't worry, I'll make the pickup when she arrives in Italy. - And what happens if she doesn't want to do it? - That's another very stupid question, where a million is concerned. (doorbell rings) - Who is it? - Reinhardt. - Help me clean this up, Luca. (Luca blowing) Here, take this home and hide it in one of your toys and don't say anything to anyone, understand? - I won't, Sara. - Sara, you all right? (doorbell rings) - Yes. I won't be a minute. - I'm getting cold out here. Sara. - Luca's coming right away, he'll let you in. Let Reinhardt in and then go home, all right? - I'll leave it open so I can get in again. - Ah, so you lock yourself in with Sara when I'm not around. - That's my business. Ciao. - Ciao, Luca. Hello there, you feeling better today? - Much better, it doesn't hurt at all now. - Ha. That's good. Did you have your injections? - Yes, I must say it made a world of difference, Reinhardt. - Fine. You're a bit nervous today? Where's Ted, upstairs? - No, he's not here, he had an appointment. - Do you mind if I get something to drink? - No, please do. It's been a tough morning at the clinic and I need it. - What about you? Can I get you something? Sara? Sara? Can I pour you a drink? - Yes, thanks, a Port. (sawing) - It's a nice looking album. - It's Luca's but maybe you shouldn't look at it. You should wait for Luca to show you, Reinhardt. You know how children are about their things. - Ah, he won't mind if I look at it. - Well as long as I don't tell him, it won't matter I guess. There is- (clock chiming) - A lot out of focus. - Tell me the truth, come on Sara, hmm? (sawing) (door banging) (metallic clattering) - I'm not sure I really know anything. I get the impression that you do though. So why don't you tell me? - Let me ask you something first. Would you mind if I came to New York with you? I mean with you and Ted, I'd love to take a vacation. (engine rumbles) (brakes screeching) Where the hell's my glass? - Over there. - Ah. There it is. Chin chin. All right, where'd you put it? I'm sorry about this. Don't make me ask again. (ominous ensemble tones) Tell me where the stuff is. Or there's no alternative, Sara. I hate to use violence but if I have to- - Do you have a deal with Ted? - That's right. Him and that girlfriend of yours in New York. - Peggy? Peggy Cole. It can't be true. - Peggy, Peggy Cole. Ah, I couldn't remember her name. (car engine roaring) Where is it? Ted's meeting me soon, come on, tell me. No, you're lying, Ted wouldn't make a deal with you. - Yes he did. - You're lying, I know you are. - Don't make me do it, Sara. I will if I have to, believe me. - Sara. - Hey. Next time before you come in, try knocking, eh? - Is this all right? - Yes, that's perfect. Just put it down and run along. Go on Luca, I'm discussing something that's rather private, so run along now like a good boy. - Don't be upset, Luca. We're talking about something that really isn't for little boys to listen to. We're talking about marriage. Hmm? - All right, I'll tell you where it is, damn you. It's hidden in that truck. (Sara weeps) - Who were you going to call? - I was going to call the police! The police, you bastard! (Reinhardt coughs) (tense blaring tones) (Sara screams) - I've got to do it Sara, you understand me? I can't afford to leave a witness around. (Sara screams) (door thudding) (anxious warbling electronic music) (chainsaw revving) (chainsaw buzzing) (car horns blaring) (whistles blaring) - Will you maniacs calm down? Hey, where are you off to? - Move back, move back, come on. Come on, be a little patient or you'll never get out of this. Come on, come on, move along, come on. (whistle blaring) (brakes screeching) (car horns blaring) - Hey, don't leave it there! (chainsaw buzzing) - I have to. - Reinhardt. What the hell's happening? Have you gone completely crazy? You kill her here, then the police will have us before we can get even halfway to the airport. - So you got your memory back. But now, well everything's more complicated, Ted. - Why, because she found it? I guarantee you she won't say a word, Reinhardt. Come on Sara, up you get. Don't sulk. We'll plaster up your leg again and be on our way. To Milan and then to New York, the three of us, all right? Don't be like that, Sara, Sara. (Reinhardt grunts) (thudding) (bottle shatters) - I should have learned never to trust you. (Reinhardt screams) (chainsaw buzzing) - My past came back but it's gone for good now. (relaxed violin, piano music) - My husband had nothing to do with this. He's innocent. I'd be dead if he hadn't got here. Reinhardt tried to kill me. I found out he'd hidden drugs in the cast he put on my leg the other day and- - That's true about the drugs, I saw them. - No, there's much more to the story than that, Sergeant and I think we'd better have a long talk. (relaxed ensemble violin music) (singing in foreign language)
