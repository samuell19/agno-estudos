Taoist White Brows! [RESIDENCE OF THE PROVINCIAL COMMANDER] Upon Taoist White Brows' death at the hands of Hung Man-Ting and Wu Ah-Biu, Wu Ah-Biu along with many Shaolin disciples were put in prison, arousing outrage amongst the populace. The Imperial Court, therefore, ordered the release of the Shaolin disciples. Arrival of Imperial Edict! [IMPERIAL EDICT] By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees: Commander of the Two Expanses, Ko Chun-Chung, will execute with immediacy these imperial orders by method of his own discretion. The previous dynasty's sanction on the restoration of the Shaolin Temple has now been lifted and restoration is permitted. Furthermore, of the rebels who conspired a coup, batches one and two of these ethnic Han criminals will be released. Observe the sentiment of the people; do not betray my intentions. This, the will of the Emperor, shall be done! [BY IMPERIAL DECREE, HAN PRISONERS TO BE RELEASED] Hey, look at this! - Come take a look! - Look! Wu Ah-Biu? [WHITE LOTUS MONASTERY] My lord. Arrival of his excellency, the Provincial Commander! Arrival of his excellency, the Provincial Commander! - My lord. - Where is Martial Uncle? Upstairs. [SCRIPTURE PAVILION] [WHITE LOTUS MAIN ALTAR] [WHITE LOTUS] What do you want from me? I bow in greeting, Martial Uncle. Martial Uncle, you have to help me this time. The Emperor has ordered the release of the Shaolin followers. Moreover, they are permitted to restore Shaolin. With this... I will not be able to avenge Master White Brows. I hope Martial Uncle will lend me his strength, and send some men to exterminate these Shaolin dregs in secret. Otherwise, their momentum will only continue to grow. This heralds disaster for the White Lotus and for you, Martial Uncle. Sister-in-law Biu! Siu-Ching! Hey, the government's releasing prisoners. Sister-in-law Biu...! Sister-in-law Biu. Man-Ting, such familiarity even though I'm not married yet. What is it? Why were you causing a ruckus out there? Sister-in-law Biu, the government's releasing prisoners. - Releasing prisoners? - That's right. - What about my brother, then?! They'll be letting him go, of course. How wonderful! - I'd never have thought... - I can see my family again! What luck! I'd never have guessed I'd live to go home. Brother Tong? Just let me down over there. Alright, easy now. Thank you. Brother Tong, let's part ways here. My home's just beneath the foot of the mountain. You should all be on your way too. Don't worry about me. Brother Biu, it was so we'd all be spared that those lap dogs tormented you so... We have to see you home safely. That's right! What he said! Actually... they already knew it was Hung Man-Ting and I who killed Bak Mei the Taoist. They had a grudge to bear. So they took this opportunity to cripple me. It had nothing to do with you. Brother Biu, you lost your leg in order to save all of us. Just say the word, and we'll be there! When my leg recovers, I will definitely join your cause, and exterminate these inhumane lap dogs! Brother Biu, let us part ways here, then. Take good care of yourself. We'll meet again! We'll meet again! Sister-in-law Biu, are you alright? - I'm alright. - Let's hurry up, then. - Brother Biu! - Big Brother! Brother Biu...! I'll be a dad soon. Brother Biu, your leg...? My leg is fine. Let's go home first. - Brother Biu. Here, let's go. - Big Brother. Alright, then. Let's go home. We're really lucky this time, huh? I haven't seen my family in so long! I never thought I'd live to go home! Die! Die! They all carked it... Hey! Did you see Wu Ah-Biu?! Didn't see him! Come. Come. Drink. - Cheers! - Drink. Drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers... Brother Biu. What a blessing that we can be together as a family. Brother Biu? You and Sister-in-law can share the joy of being a family now. But as for Siu-Ching and I... Man-Ting, you can rest assured. Siu-Ching is all grown up now. Brother Biu will make arrangements, of course. As soon as we become husband and wife, we'll all be family. Brother Biu can't use his leg. And you're now with child. Siu-Ching and I can give you a hand. Siu-Ching? Let's drink to Brother and Sister-in-law Biu. Drink. Siu-Ching, go back to your room. - Brother Biu... - Who are you looking for?! Little Sister, be careful of the flames! Hurry up, let's help! Sister-in-law! Wu's Junior, we'll save you! Martial Brother Wu, what's going on here?! The Imperial Court must've sent them to eliminate us! The Qing Court is so unjust... We'll take their lives! - Sister-in-law! - Mei-Ha, are you hurt?! Brother Biu... I'm fine... Little Sister, take care of Sister-in-law. We'll retreat as we fight! Siu-Ching, we'll go inside and pack some clothes... Halt! [WHITE LOTUS] Oh... so it's the White Lotus Sect's hermetic Taoist Master White Lotus! Taoist Master White Lotus, there have never been grievances between Shaolin and the White Lotus. Why have you attacked us?! Have the two of you forgotten that you killed my junior, Taoist White Brows? Oh... I understand now. So it was Ko Chun-Chung who incited you to come here! Enough talk. Wu Ah-Biu. Hung Man-Ting. I, Taoist White Lotus, have come here today to experience your abilities for myself. Fine, I'll teach you, then! Brother Biu, you can't use your leg. Leave him to me! Your Shaolin blade is only good for gutting fish. Actually, who needs a blade to finish off you people? You really want to run off that badly, huh? I'll let you take seven steps. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Brother Biu! Tiger and Crane Double Form! Leave it to me! Tiger and Crane Cry Together. My leg can't keep up! Take Sister-in-law and run! Brother Biu, you-- Why are you still here?! Wipe out every last one of them! Take that! Your crippled crane can only peck at dead fish and dead prawns. Your Shaolin Fist can't even touch my clothes. How pathetic! Brother Biu! Brother Biu...! Big Brother...! Why are you still here?! Take Sister-in-law and go, now! Siu-Ching, you-- Don't worry about me. I have to avenge my brother! Siu-Ching! Why are you still here?! Little girl... where have they gone? In here! Leave no stone unturned! Sister-in-law Biu, I'm worried about Siu-Ching. Why don't we head home and check up on her? They have strength in numbers... Siu-Ching will have more trouble than fortune. How about we lay low for now, work out what to do later? In that case... Where can we hide? I have a relative in Wai On Town. Let's ask them for help. Alright. Here. [WHITE LOTUS MAIN ALTAR] - Drink. - Martial Uncle. Come, come, come. Let us drink. Martial Uncle, I raise my glass to you. - Come, come, come. - Drink. It was only with Martial Uncle's support that we could accomplish our plan. Most unfortunate though... that Hung Man-Ting managed to escape. Tiger and Crane Double Form is absolutely nothing to me. What's more, the crippled crane is now dead. Nevertheless, your dead master, my junior, White Brows, has been properly avenged. The Master's words ring true. Martial Uncle, I fear those surviving dregs will... Put your mind at ease. Hung Man-Ting has the same temperament as his father, Hung Hei-Gun. Sooner or later, he'll come personally knocking on death's door. Keep with our original plan, and continue the extermination of the Shaolin disciples! Understood. [SHAOLIN TEMPLE RESTORATION RECRUITMENT STATION] - Thank you, kind patron... - I'm here to help. Amitabha. Amitabha. Amitabha. Over here! Put it over there! Over there! [SHAOLIN TEMPLE] - This Emperor's pretty good. - Yeah! - He let us go, and is letting us rebuild the Shaolin Temple. What was that? - Bring the bricks over here! - Thank you, kind patron. There are more people coming to help. [RESTORATION] Thank you, kind patron. Please sign your name first. No need! We're all friends here! You can find tools over there. No... No need! We've brought our own. The two of you are not helping? Alright. Alright. Alright... Over here. Clear it out. You are...? Die! Die...! Die! Die! Let's go! [WAI ON TOWN] Knife and scissor sharpening! It's alright if you don't buy... - It's cheap, it's high quality! - Knife and... Man-Ting? Why don't we ask someone? - Shopkeeper? - Y-Yes? What can I get you? I've heard there's a papercraft shop in this town... Oh...! You want a papercraft shop, is that it? There... it's the one over there. [PAK CHEUNG PAPERCRAFT SHOP] Ah... Madam, what can I get for you? We're not here to shop. May I ask if Wu Nai-Shing is in? Wu Nai-Shing...? There's nobody named Wu here. His face is kind of skinny... He's got some scabies on his head. Oh, Shing! Papercraft Shing, right? - Yes! - I'll tell him to come out. Shing! Papercraft Shing...! Shing! Get out here! What a damn racket... What the hell's going on...? - Do you have to be so loud? - There's someone looking for you! Oh, Sister-in-law. Brother Shing. How nice of you to visit me. Where's Brother Biu? We're in a spot of trouble. We want to stay here for a few days. And this is...? This is Brother Biu's martial arts brother, Hung Man-Ting. Brother Shing. Oh...! So this is the Hung Man-Ting who killed Taoist White Brows! Brother Biu told me all about it. Brother Shing? Let's not talk now. - Take us inside first. - Oh... sure! Follow me. Come over here. Over here. Come in. - Take a seat, Man-Ting. - Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brother Shing. So, Sister-in-law? Just what's happened to Brother Biu? It's like this. Brother Biu and Siu-Ching... They've both been killed by the Taoist Master White Lotus. All the other released anti-Qing patriots... have met the same fate. It's all just destiny. I told him right from the start not to practise kung fu... Join up with those unions or whatever. Sister-in-law? Don't be sad. Your health is important. You two stay here for now. Man-Ting can give me a hand with work. I manage things out here. I just have to let the owner know when he's back. - Thank you. - Thank you, Brother Shing. We're all family, let's stop talking about bad things. Ah, right... Sister-in-law? I'm going to take Man-Ting over to the other room. Man-Ting? You can sleep on my bed. Help me tidy up over there. I'll go fetch a bed board. Man-Ting? Not so hard. You have to be gentle when bending it. Taoist Master White Lotus...! Crane's beak? If we take Brother Biu's Crane Form Fist, combine it with my Tiger Form Fist, it can become Tiger and Crane Double Form. With this... the White Lotus can be defeated! Man-Ting? Have some tea. - Have some tea. - Thank you. Brother Shing? For as long as I've been here... you've taken good care of me. Don't say stuff like that! But... I do have a request. What kind of request? I hope that during my training... you'll stand-in for Brother Biu's Crane Form Fist. No way! I might've learnt a bit with Brother Biu when I was a kid, but for as long as I've worked here, I haven't even raised a fist. I've forgotten it all! Don't worry. I've more or less mastered Brother Biu's Crane Form Fist already. You just have to be willing to learn. Well... Well, do you want revenge? Revenge? Well, of course I do! It's settled, then. Starting from today, you and I will practise Tiger and Crane Double Form. Come on! Awesome, huh? Let's keep going! This is my big brother Biu's Crane Pecks at Prawn. It's something, huh? Tiger and Crane Advance! Back in the day, Taoist White Brows met his end at Brother Biu's and my Tiger and Crane Double Form! Tiger Crouches, Crane Cries! Digging Sand, Crane Wings! Hung Man-Ting, Tiger and Crane Double Stop! You want to stop? We can't. Get up. Brother Shing, you have to treat this as that Taoist White Lotus. Treat this as that Taoist White Lotus. Crane beak! Crane beak beak beak beak beak... - It really hurts...! - Tiger and Crane Cry Together! Hey! I'm not Taoist White Lotus! White Crane's Head Descends! I've turned into... Taoist White Crane now...! Brother Shing, keep going. I'm finished... Hey! It's not covered, I'll die! Hey! I still need that! There's still more? Brother Shing, how's my kung fu? Powerful enough. Fast enough. Much better than when you were training with me. For the sake of defeating the White Lotus, I have to painstakingly practise Tiger Crane Double Form. Man-Ting. Your Tiger and Crane Double Form isn't bad, of course... However... it won't be that easy to defeat the White Lotus. How can I endure the shame of being left alive? For the sake of Brother Biu, Siu-Ching, and all the anti-Qing patriots. For them, I must have revenge! Kind patron, may I ask who you are looking for? I am Hung Man-Ting. I'm here for White Lotus! Kind patron, perhaps you should come back another day. The Master is not seeing guests today. He won't see me, but I'll see him! Hung Man-Ting is coming...! Hung Man-Ting is coming...! Hung Man-Ting is coming...! Taoist White Lotus! Taoist White Lotus! Hung Man-Ting. Ko Chun-Chung, the Imperial Court has already reconciled with Shaolin! - But you! - But my master has not been avenged! Martial Brother Wu Ah-Biu and I are responsible for White Brows' death! But you colluded with the White Lotus Sect, murdering the Shaolin disciples freed by the Imperial Court. I've come here today to vanquish you and Taoist White Lotus! Martial Uncle was right. Sooner or later, you'll come personally knocking on death's door. You coordinate your Tiger and Crane Double Form with speed. [LOTUS GARDEN] Hung Man-Ting's out there! What is all the commotion outside? Report, Master: Hung Man-Ting is here. Hung Man-Ting? Ko Chun-Chung! Leave it to me. Understood. Taoist White Lotus! Hung Man-Ting, today is the Tuen Ng Festival. An auspicious day of cleansing and purification according to the Tao. Originally, I was to refrain from taking any lives. But you came all this way! I'm here to send you to the Dragon King! You're using dead Wu Ah-Biu's Crippled Crane Form. Turns out you're quite smart. Your Tiger and Crane Double Form has little effect on me. That's still not good enough. You think you're still a child and want a piggyback? Hung Man-Ting! How can your half-arsed Tiger and Crane Double Form be worthy of even coming near me? Don't even think about it. You'll only ever be good enough if you join that damned Wu Ah-Biu in Hell. After him! Chun-Chung! Do not give chase! - Martial Uncle. - Send men in pursuit. We'll get him in one fell swoop! Come and shop here! Buy something. Have a look around. It's high quality. Choose whatever you like. Buy something, mister! Feel free to browse. Thank you for your custom. We have tables inside. Table for two? If you're here for tea, please come in. Table for two? There are tables over there. We're looking for someone. Oh? Feel free to look, then. What is it? Did you see a young man wearing beige come in here? Oh...! He just started working here. It's the one who greeted you at the door. Damn! We got tricked. After him! How is it? Man-Ting, Sister-in-law's already given birth. You're only bringing the boiled water now? Just look at you... You've even got your shirt on inside-out! I... Congratulations. Congratulations... Is it a boy or a girl? Congratulations to you! She's given birth to a big fat boy! I'm not... Your wife's body is very weak. Remember, more nutritious stews for her. I have something to do. I'll come back tomorrow. H-h-hey...! Man-Ting? Where did you go on the day I gave birth? Brother Shing couldn't even ask you for help. - I... - I'll do the talking. Sister-in-law? Man-Ting refused to tell you this whole time. He snuck off by himself to find White Lotus. But he got beaten by White Lotus. What's that? White Lotus' martial arts is so powerful, yet you came back alive? What a stroke of luck. What's so tough about White Lotus anyway? But I can't work out why, no matter what, I just couldn't hit him. He's actually pretty capable. He was followed by White Lotus' men. He managed to come back here by disguising himself as a waiter! Man-Ting, I've reminded you before. Your martial arts is still far behind White Lotus'. Could it be my punches aren't fast enough? Once I've regained some of my strength, we'll figure out how to defeat White Lotus together. You should stay here in the meantime, lend Brother Shing a hand. When you're free, you can help me look after my son. - In that case... - Right, look after the child! Sister-in-law, let me hold my nephew. Oh, no, who's a poor dear? Good boy... Such a good boy. Good boy... I can't keep going! I can't keep going...! You have to keep going even if you can't! Man-Ting! Hurry up and let him down! Are you training or trying to beat him to death? I'm not beating him up. I'm training my speed, is all. I just can't help but think my punches aren't as fast as White Lotus can dodge. If you keep up this kind of training, your attacks will never hit White Lotus. Because he uses a special kind of martial arts. What kind of martial arts? Bring a paper doll out here and try hitting it, then you'll understand. Brother Shing, go bring out a paper doll. Alright. Better a paper doll gets beaten up than me. Hold on. Coming, coming, coming, coming! There. This one look's like White Lotus, yeah? Man-Ting, try hitting it. Hold it! Man-Ting, let me show you. There. That's how you do it. Ah...! Good job! There, Man-Ting. You see that? It doesn't move no matter how she hits it. Wispy arms and wispy legs. There's no power at all! Of course the paper doll doesn't move. Paper dolls are made from paper and bamboo. The body is very light. The more powerful the force of the punch, the greater the pressure. This increases the speed of its retreat. Sister-in-law? What was that wispy arms and wispy legs martial arts you used on the doll? Oh! That was women's kung fu. Man-Ting? Your Tiger and Crane Double Form will have trouble hitting White Lotus. Sister-in-law, hurry up and teach me, then. For a man to pick up women's kung fu, it won't just happen overnight. - What should I do, then? - I'll be able to teach you. But you have to master the ways of a woman: Embroidery, looking after children. When your hands are as soft and delicate as a woman's... then I will teach you. In that case... For the sake of defeating White Lotus... you have my word! Good boy... Don't cry... Man-Ting? Sister-in-law asked you to look after him, but you're making him cry. Of course! Even if he wasn't crying, one look at your face will do it. C'mon, you take care of him for a bit. Let me get some work done. Man-Ting, that's not the way to do it. When it comes to embroidery, your hand must be supple. When pulling the thread, you must pull it higher. Good boy... Don't cry. Good boy... I'll sing you a song later on. Good boy... The moonlight, moonlight, shines on the patio. Li'l baby, be good, be good, and lie on the bed. Tomorrow morning mother needs to hurry and plant the rice seedlings. Grandfather minds the cows, he goes up the hillock. Li'l baby, you'll soon grow up, big and strong. Man-Ting-- Do you want my son to fall to death?! Sister-in-law, don't worry. - Nephew's already used to me. - That's right. Man-Ting's already become half a woman. All wispy arms and wispy legs. You can start teaching him now. Very well. I'll begin to teach you. Brother Shing, take baby inside. Here, here, here. - Hold him tight. - Come on, Man-Ting. Relax your entire body. Slowly raise up both arms. Softer! Your arms need to be more relaxed. Be supple when striking forward. Don't exert yourself. Even lower. Your head has to be down. Get up and try again. Follow my lead. Feels so good! Feels so good! Sister-in-law, how am I doing? Man-Ting, why is your voice like that? Sister-in-law? Practise women's kung fu a lot and everything changes. If he keeps this up... Sister-in-law... How am I doing? Not bad at all. Try combining it with your Tiger and Crane Double Form. Alright. - So? Is there any force to my punches? - Yes. It's just a bit weak though. So strong! So strong! So strong. So Strong... The force is really strong. There's still force? Man-Ting! You unleash strength in your Tiger and Crane Double Form too early. Your fist needs to touch the opponent's body before you unleash your strength. Brother Shing, stand back a bit. I'll practise with you. Unleash your strength. Again! Sister-in-law...! That's the way! Keep going! Sister-in-law, stop.. Flank Sinews Point! Heavenly Pool Point! Middle Epigastrium Point! Solar Point! Throat Point! Five Pivots Point! Heavenly Courtyard Point! Capital Gate Point! Man-Ting, why did you stop?! Sister-in-law... Your vengeance runs as deep as a sea of blood... You have to treat me as though I am White Lotus himself! Although you are using your moves correctly, there's still force to your punches! We can't stop. We have to keep fighting! You're my sister-in-law. How can I possibly touch you like this and also like this? Enough talk! Come on! Sister-in-law? I'm done practising. I want you to practise! You can't make me! Man-Ting! Sister-in-law, don't be so irritated. You can't blame Man-Ting. "Men and women should not touch during an exchange." In a fight, you're like this and this and this... It's kind of awkward, y'know? Ah...! Man-Ting? You can use... Shing, come over here. What is it, Boss? Today is already the 10th of July. The order for South Village is due in three days. Why are there fewer and fewer paper dolls? The order was finished well in advance, but the cats... scratched it all up! Get them to hurry it up, then! Right... Right... I can't believe he bought it... Now we have to Man-Ting? Take this pack of medicine inside and brew it for Sister-in-law. Brother Shing, I'm working right now. Get someone else to do it. I can't. How can I trust anyone else? These kind of herbs need to be boiled slowly on a low heat. In that case... I'll do it. - Sin? - Yes? Brother Shing. Brother Shing! Hurry up and bring them out! Coming! Hey, Brother Shing? This is it? Are there any more? Nope. This is all there is. Besides, any others would've gone to orders. Anyway, it'll be fine! I'm really sleepy. You have fun now. Brother Shing? Brother Shing, I've done it! Hey, stop bothering me. I'm real sleepy... Hey, I'm going to Lotus Mountain tomorrow! Go wherever you want. Stop bothering me...! Man-Ting...? Man-Ting...?! Get up, it's time for work. What did he say to me last night? Oh no! Man-Ting? Man-Ting?! Man-Ting...?! Shopkeeper? Where's Hung Man-Ting? He left ages ago! Oh, shit! Man-Ting... Man-Ting...?! Man-Ting...?! Oh, Man-Ting! Man-Ting... Man-Ting, where are you going? I'm going up Lotus Mountain to find White Lotus. Hey, your kung fu... My kung fu has been perfected. I can defeat White Lotus! Don't do it! You can't go! Huh? Is Sister-in-law alright? No. It's just the paper dolls you've been practising on... The boss wanted me to fulfill an order so I tampered with them... Brother Shing. I know you're worried about me. You have my gratitude. You're afraid I won't come back this time. Don't worry. Take care of Sister-in-law and Nephew, and wait for good news of my return! [WHITE LOTUS MONASTERY] [WHITE LOTUS MAIN ALTAR] [INTEGRITY] You bested my Golden Youths' Dragon Spring Sword. There has been significant improvement in your kung fu. You rotten egg! Did you change genders? What strange attack are you doing now? Embroidery Fist. You want to overcome my virgin body? Not so simple. I will have to try, then. Good stuff, boy You managed to get close to me by using the forcelessness of the Women's Fist. However, my fatal pressure point is not here. Come closer and try and find it. It isn't there either. Boy, isn't my hearing even better now? Do you think I'm White Brows? Boy, there's still force to your Embroidery Fist. Papercraft Shing...? Now then, your pressure point hitting kung fu is especially poor. Let me demonstrate for you. This is how you hit a pressure point! Pressure points are inside the muscles of the body. If you lack exertion, then you have no way of hitting someone's pressure points. Boy, put your mind at ease. I did not hit your fatal pressure point. I don't want you to die here! You'll just soil the purity of this place! I want you to savour my Hundred Steps Soul Pursuing Fist as you slowly walk out the door one step at a time! You may leave now. You best hurry back. Hung Man-Ting?! Brother Shing... Why has Man-Ting still not woken up yet? Well... Looks like we have to call a doctor. Doctor? With what money? Money...? Ah! I have an idea! Wait for me here. Boss? What is it? I want a month's pay in advance. What was that?! You only borrowed money last month, now you want to borrow more?! Last month was for my sister-in-law's childbirth. What about this time? Hung Man-Ting's been beaten up badly so I need money to call a doctor! - Always getting into fights... - No...! Hung Man-Ting went up White Lotus Mountain and was severely wounded by Master White Lotus! He was severely wounded by Master White Lotus?! Why didn't you say so sooner?! - Go back. I'll be over right away. - Alright. Brother Shing, did you borrow the money? I didn't... What now, then? The boss said he's coming right over to see him. - Boss! - Boss. - Can Man-Ting be saved?! - Can he be saved?! He must have endured Master White Lotus' Hundred Steps Soul Pursuing Fist. If he takes another 19 steps, his blood circulation will speed up, the fist venom will seal up all his pressure points, and he can't be saved. Oh my! Luckily, I carried him back here. Boss? What do we do now? Shing, hurry up and bring me the needle case. Open it up. I can't thank you enough. It was only my duty. Boss? You are...? I'm the same as you. I'm also an anti-Qing patriot. My mission is liaison work, so I'm regularly away from here. I have to leave here again for a few days from tomorrow. - What about Man-Ting, then? - No need to worry. Take out the needles after six hours. As long as he takes this medicine, his body will begin to heal. Open the door! Coming! Oh... Boss? Come in. Don't get up. How are you feeling? My breathing is steadier. I'm much better now. My thanks to you, Boss. No need to thank me. Shing deserves some credit too. I need to be away for a few days. This acupuncture book will be very helpful regarding your pressure points. Have a read of it. Brother Shing? Please see the boss out. [ACUPUNCTURE: THE COMPLETE WORKS] Martial Uncle. What progress have you made these past few months out in the world? With Martial Uncle's direction, I have destroyed several anti-Qing cells. However, there's still been no sign of Hung Man-Ting's whereabouts. Rest assured. He suffered my Hundred Steps Soul Pursuing Fist. Even if he has superhuman endurance, he will still die. Martial Uncle, you are truly capable. Even if he doesn't die, there isn't any kind of martial arts he can use to defeat you. [ACUPUNCTURE: THE COMPLETE WORKS] [- SKULL'S REST - HEAVENLY WINDOW] [BLADDER MERIDIAN PRESSURE POINT LOCATIONS] [- HEAVENLY SPRING - HEAVENLY POOL] Man-Ting! It's time for supper! Come in. Man-Ting...? What the hell are you two up to anyway? Sister-in-law? Acupuncture is very coherent. What's more, it has very definite effects on the human body. If we don't use needles, only our fingers to hit the other's pressure points, then there won't be much of an effect. So many pressure points on the human body... It's really hard to memorise them all. You just have to memorise! How's that worse than me being poked till I cry and laugh?! That's enough talk. Come on. Have some sticky rice dumplings. Ah... Sister-in-law? Why are there sticky rice dumplings? Oh? Have you forgotten? Tomorrow is Tuen Ng Festival. Tuen Ng Festival? Ah, Sister-in-law? Buy me two big packs of embroidery needles tomorrow. Embroidery needles...? Oh, alright. Hey! What are you playing at?! You wanna get me into trouble again? You can count me out; I could die! You don't need to worry! I'm using them for something. Tuen Ng Festival...? Dragon boat water? Come on! Hung Man-Ting, you're still alive?! Ko Chun-Chung, I'm not dead yet. The one who's dead is you! Where is Taoist White Lotus?! You damn brat! How's an old arse worth peeping at?! Hung Man-Ting! No one dares to just barge into this place! You can come in, but you can never leave! Men! Hung Man-Ting. Whoever is struck by my Soul Pursuing Fist will upon taking one hundred steps, bleed from all seven orifices and die. Why haven't you died?! Oh...! It's quite simple really. Of 100 steps, I've only taken 99. I've still got one to go, so that's why I haven't died. Nonsense! Old coot, so that makes my kung fu even more profound than yours, is that it? Kill him! Damn brat, you're a piece of work! Oh no, got the hiccups? It must be acid reflux! Who taught you-- To use needles to hit pressure points-- I'm not gonna tell. I'll let you relish another one. I'm very sorry. I pricked you in your coughing pressure point. You... It's alright, I'll relieve your coughing. There's no use crying, old man. You can't prick me to death... Taoist White Lotus, my crazed needles finally got your fatal pressure point! Damn brat! Your crazed needles cannot hit my fatal pressure point! My Soul Pursuing Fist won't even give you a single step this time! I want you to die now! Old coot... You're still keeping up this dying act?! You finally... found my fatal pressure point... So that's where your fatal pressure point was! Hooray! I killed the Taoist White Lotus! [A SHAW BROTHERS PRODUCTION, WITHOUT A DOUBT A FINE FILM]
