Now, Hope, any plans for a solo album? Oh, I couldn't do any of this without my sister. No, ma'am. She is being modest. Oh, Harper's the real artist here. We are a team, a good one. And everyone loves Hope's voice. I just sing with what the Lord gave me. All credit goes to Him and very long showers. I love singing in the shower. I can attest to that. Y'all ever get into fights? Sisters tend to do that from time to time. We disagree sometimes. She wants to go one way, and I want to go another. But we're in this together. We're a team. And it's a blessing to have someone on this crazy journey that comes from the same place that you come from. And somebody who just knows your soul. That's right. No one understands you like your sister. What's next for the Dutchess Sisters? Best New Artist is nothing to sniff at. A country act has never won before, much less two gals. Where y'all gonna go from here? Well, we made it to the top, and that is right where we're gonna stay. That's right. ♪ You're like me ♪ So love me anyway ♪ Love me anyway ♪ Love me anyway ♪ Love me anyway Thank you, Nashville! Thank you! Once again, we are Torn Hearts! Come on! Great show tonight. Thank you. Well, cheers to a great show. Cheers. No. Thank you. Thank you so much. So... ...that last song was supposed to be a ballad. Yeah, well, we played it the way I wrote it, and the crowd loved it. I mean, they did, baby. You saw it. Yeah. I did. And they did. But they're drunk, and the crowd wasn't who you needed to impress tonight. Take a look over there at eleven o'clock. That is Caleb Crawford. I invited him down to see your set tonight. I didn't tell you 'cause I didn't want to freak you out. He's looking for a new opening act for his summer tour. Manager says they need more women, for optics. And because we're good? Yeah. Because you're good, Jordan. But good don't matter if you don't fit the image he's looking for. What image is that? He makes corny music for soccer moms. What's he calling the tour? Um, "White Wines and Feelings"? What? Right. I get that you don't like it. - Thank you. - Thank you. But there's a way things are done in this town. Now, opening up for a big boy country star like Caleb Crawford could give Torn Hearts just the break you've been looking for. Make her be cool. Play nice. Caleb! Yeah, yeah. Come here, you handsome devil. I want to introduce you to the gals. Jordan, Leigh, Torn Hearts. Ladies, quite a show. Very well done. Thank you for coming out. We're such big fans of yours. Oh, yeah. Big huge star like yourself, how do you find the time? I owed Richie a favor. Turns out it was a pleasure. Told you. You did. So, just to be clear, you... you liked our last song just now? What about it? The energy? The lyrics? The tempo? Jordan just needs constant feedback. It's a part of her process as an artist. Artist to artist, I really liked it. Hey, so what's going on tonight? Still early. Y'all gonna raise some hell or what? Yeah. I got these ladies in the studio first thing tomorrow. I think we're just gonna go hit the hay. What? You got a curfew? Your daddy ain't here. Well, mine's not. I do not call him daddy. I could use one more drink. You know, Richie's right. We've... we've got a lot going on in the morning. Come on. It's one drink. It's never just one drink with you. Well, then let's have a few drinks. What do you say? Let me grab my purse. Perfect. So, what's your story? Small-town girl? Big dreams? Fuck are you talking about? Do I look like a cliché? They're clichés for a reason. Oh, that won't be necessary. Yes, it is. Okay. Sorry about that. As if you don't love the attention. Cheers. Cheers. Can I ask you something? Sure thing. Do you like, um... do you like being famous? To be honest... I fucking love it. Huh. What's that smirk on your face? Is that judgment? No, it's fine. It's fine. I... I think fame is compelling. Okay. But, Leigh's always been the one with stars in her eyes. You know? Yeah. She wants to be on TV, play the big stadiums. I don't know. I... I think that if I got to write music that I really loved for the rest of my life... ...I'd be happy. I get that. Oh, my God! I am so sorry. You're Caleb Crawford, right? That's right. I am a huge fan. I do my elliptical to "Boots On, Black Out" every morning. That's so nice. Oh, my... I got to get your autograph. Oh. Ooh. Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. That's okay. It's all right. You cannot take me anywhere. - What's your name, ma'am? - Um, it's Tammi. - Tammi. - Tammi. Nobody is gonna believe that you are here in this bar. I can't believe it! This is wild! You got to meet my friends. Hey, y'all! Jenny! Kelly! It's Caleb Crawford! All right, thank you so much. - Look! He's here! - Appreciate it. This is the greatest night of my life! ♪ Same damn thing anyhow God fucking damn it. Hey. So much for an early night. Okay. What's wrong? Jordan better not fuck this up. Do you have any idea how long I've been trying to get Caleb down to see you guys? Do you have any idea how long I've been courting him for? Look, she's a lot savvier than you think. She's... she's fine. She's a liability, Leigh. Well, what do you want me to do? Huh? I mean, I can admit that we haven't been on the same page lately, but... I mean, she's my best friend. You guys do this all the time. What would you like me to do? Tell me. Hey, nobody's perfect. Hmm. You're pretty close. Mm. I'll talk to her. Okay? Hmm. Hell you will. She's got you wrapped around her little finger. Oh, really? Does she? Is that what you think? Doesn't really seem to matter much what I think these days, Leigh. You want to fall out tonight, so let's fall out tonight. It is not what I said. Is it? - Where... where are you going? - Home. My home. Leigh, babe, come on, get in the car. Just... I... I'm sorry. I will make it up to you. Maybe tomorrow. Night. Think the floor-to-ceiling chandelier is big enough? Why not just extend it to the roof? Hey, you should see my L.A. place. Oh, my God. Harper Dutch? What? Leigh and I are obsessed with the Dutchess Sisters. Her even more than me. That's how I want us to be. Minus the untimely end, of course. You'll get there. You know, Richie's not a bad... Don't even bring him up. You know, if it were up to him, we'd be some... some robotic pop country princesses. I know we can be so much more. Huh. Both of you? What are you trying to say? I only know what I saw. I saw you, musician, songwriter. You are the whole package. Hmm. You just need that, uh, next big thing. Yeah. Well, do you have any idea what that thing might be? Uh, I didn't want to talk shop tonight, but I might as well tell you the, um... the label wants to make it an all-guys tour this summer. All guys? Hmm. Yeah. Did you find that out before or after we had sex? Before. Did you have sex with me so I'd take you on tour? No, of course not. Huh. How did you get that photo with Harper Dutch? It was a whole fucking thing. Still kind of pissed about it. Her team reached out to my team about a duet. We rehearsed a couple times. Was gonna be this real special opportunity for me. You know? Harper Dutch's first single after, uh... everything that happened, and, uh, it's with Caleb Crawford. But, uh, she called it off. Said I wasn't the right one. Mm. Bet that never happens to you. No, no, no. Don't turn this around on me like I'm some kind of sexist prick. You wouldn't believe what she put me through. Harper Dutch? There's something... Just trust me on this one. Okay? Is that her house? Yeah. Where is it? Why? Well, maybe she'd want to record a song with us. You know, just the ladies. What's her address? You know I can't tell you that. Why? 'Cause you missed out on your PR opportunity? Th... this would be more to us than that. It's exactly what we need right now. You can't just cut the line, Jordan. Just got to be patient. Is that how you got to where you are? You were very, very patient? Jordan? I thought you'd be at Richie's. No. No, we got into a big fight. So figured I'd put my insomnia to use. Can you just please try and behave at the studio today? Um, about that... Oh, God, what? What if I told you I got something special from Caleb's house? What, you mean besides a UTI? I'm serious. Please tell me we got confirmation that we're touring with them. Oh, I don't know. We didn't get down to the nitty gritty. I got something better. - Harper Dutch's address. - Okay. And how did you get that? Caleb gave it to me. Oh, I bet he did. Yes, he did. Thought we could go there, ask her to record a song with us. Jordan. Okay, you know I love the Dutchess Sisters. I mean, I would d... die to meet Harper Dutch, but we can't just show up at her house. I mean, sh... she doesn't know us. Who gives a shit, Leigh? Are you... She would fucking love us! Come on. We've said we need to get to the next level. Well, this is it, Leigh. Okay? You got to trust me. Maybe we could talk to Richie about it. Let's see what he thinks. Or just listen to me. I'm your partner. I've got a vision for this band. I'll think about it. Hey, do you remember when we were first getting started? We would always say we're in this together. High highs, low lows. How dare you use my favorite Dutchess Sisters song against me? Mm. Think about it. You know what Harper Dutch's favorite pie is? No. But I bet you do. Yeah, bet your sweet ass I do. Strawberry rhubarb. We're already up. Might as well make a quick stop before the studio. Emphasis on "quick." You have my word. This is gonna be a high high. I can feel it. I can, too. ♪ My mama always told me We are lost. No, we're not. It says we're... says we're going the right way. This doesn't even look like a road. What was that? What? There's a call box. Know what you're gonna say? Yeah. All right. Go for it. Okay. You'll be great. I feel like... Should I just do it again? Yeah. Who is it? Hello? Hi. S... sorry. Um... My name is Jordan Wilder, and I'm here with my... my band mate, Leigh Black house. Hi. And? Um... we, uh... well, Leigh, Leigh is your biggest fan. But we're also your contemporaries and talented musicians. Um... Yeah, I think you girls better get to leaving before I call the police. M.. Miss Dutch, look, I... I know that this must come as a surprise, but... I mean, doesn't it remind you of the good old days? You know, neighbors calling on neighbors? I... I watched the videos of your summer tour in '91, like, over and over again. And as a little girl, I even got my mom to make me the same sequin skirt that Hope owned. Where'd you get those videos of my last tour? Oh, uh, on the Internet. Uh, we're a duo called Torn Hearts. We're managed by Richie Raleigh Jones, and we're about to go on tour with Caleb Crawford. We're the real deal. Did you say Richie Raleigh Jones? Yes, ma'am. Guy's a prick. We know. But he's all we got right now, and, uh, you know, we could just... we could use some advice from a woman who's seen it all. I mean, you and your sister really are our heroes, Miss Dutch. Um... we're so sorry for your loss. Ma'am? You still there? Damn it. I shouldn't have said that. Shit. Oh, my God. Leigh. Are you kidding me? Little overgrown. A little bit. Doesn't look like she gets many visitors, huh? Yeah. Gosh, this place is huge. Guess she left it open for us. Obviously. Go. Obviously. Where do you think she is? I don't know. Oh, my God. It's just a mannequin. No, it's not just a mannequin. Oh, my God, it's a mannequin wearing Hope Dutch's tour outfit from the first Dutchess Sisters live album. Leigh. Leigh. What? All right, ladies. Come on in. You gonna sit? Yeah. Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Miss Dutch, we... we so appreciate you for letting us into your house like this. It's... You look amazing. We are real fans of yours. Yeah. Yeah, we... we listened to your music the whole way here. Takin' the Truck. Great album. Mm. I'm Jordan Wilder. This is... I'm Leigh Black house. It is such an honor. Truly. Oh, um, this is for you. It's, uh, strawberry rhubarb, your favorite. Strawberry rhubarb was my sister's favorite. Oh, I'm... I am so sorry. I... I read it in a magazine article when I was younger, and I... Yeah. You can't always believe what you read. You two are a duo? Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am. Mm. Which one of you is better? Uh... Uh, we're the same. Yeah, we're equals. Yeah. Huh. So, you, uh... came to my gate and you, uh, said you wanted some advice. What you want to know? We did, um, b... but we also heard that you might be interested in making music again. Who the hell told you that? That's not what you told me when you came to my gate. You said that you wanted advice. Well... I think we'd take advice, too. I mean, we're... you know, we're just starting out, and, I mean, you... you've been through it all. You're amazing. Not an early riser? Oh. No, just like to take my time. Yeah, no, no. She's, um, being polite. She needs a mixer. Mm-hmm. The prissy ones always do. Oh. Thank you. Yeah, um, the hard liquor is kind of rough on my voice. You're the singer? Yeah. Oh, we both sing. Yeah, I... I do harmonies mostly. And play guitar. Like you. And I usually sing the melodies and play percussion. Yeah. Tambourine, sometimes the triangle. Some of the songs have a little bit of a shaker element. Like Hope? Yeah. So, you girls want me to do a song with you? That's why you're here? Oh. We know it sounds crazy. More than anything in the world. Yeah. That... Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh. Then you better drink my damn booze. Oh. Hmm. Y'all any good? Well, we'd love to show ya. Absolutely. What now? I don't... Come on, then! Oh. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Holy shit. Oh, my God. Which one you want to play? Anything you'd allow. Pick your poison. Oh. This one. This is from the '93 tour, right? Uh, that's gonna need some tuning. Yeah. You know, I read somewhere once that you used to write every single day, so that's what I started to do. Uh, nobody touches my microphone without my permission. Yes, ma'am. Oh, and unfortunately, no tambourines. It's not about the percussion. It's about her voice. Well, I did sing a lot in the shower when I was a teenager, so... I think we're gonna... I think we're gonna even things out. Here. Oh, I... I couldn't. I... Oh, no, no. I want you to borrow it. It was Hope's. She used to wear it all the time. Just go on. Put it on. Oh, my... Look at you with those tiny bones. - Um... - Okay. Well, uh, do... do you want something upbeat? You know what this is, missy? This is called a shot. You don't get many in life, so don't mess it up. Okay. Um, well, this is an original. It's called "Let Me Know." - Two, three... - Hey. Let's do a Dutchess Sisters song. But we, um... "Highs and Lows." That's our song, right? Trust me. Okay. Uh, "Highs and Lows." Two, three, four. ♪ It's why we stay... Stop! Just stop. Oh. Sorry. Um... We can play something else, maybe something that... I'll do it. Y... you... What? I'll do that song with you. Are you kidding? Are you kidding me? Come on, give me my guitar. What? Give me that guitar. You... You will not regret this. Here we go. I promise. No, you will not either. Oh. This is how we celebrate! You girls want to be rock stars, right? This is the way we do it! This is gonna be great. I can just tell. I'm gonna go get some more drinks going. Did she just slap your ass? Yeah. Y... yeah. Harper Dutch just slapped your ass. I would feel reborn. Jordan, this is amazing. She wants to do the song with us. I... I know. Did she have to, like, slap my ass, though? Oh, my God, I'm sure she's gotten her ass slapped by every producer in town while she was climbing the ladder. Yeah. Jordan, we're doing a song with Harper Dutch. I know. I know, Leigh. I can't fucking believe. I... Oh, my God. We're doing a song with Harper freaking Dutch! I know that one of you is not a whiskey drinker, so, uh, what can I get you? Um... uh, vodka, if you have it, it'd be great. Uh, you know, I might have some vodka. The... the gal who brings my groceries, - she didn't come this week. - Oh. But... but wait just a second. Oh. Vodka all around. Oh, shit! Okay. She has it! You girls are right on time. I have not written a song in years, but I been thinking about it lately, and I got loads of ideas percolating. You bored? Uh, n... no. No, ma'am. No, um... It... it's just our manager. We were supposed to be at the studio this morning. Yeah, yeah. But this is way more important. We can just finish our celebration later. You... you go ahead on. Just go on. Go on. Okay. All right. I... I'll be quick. Mm-hmm. Quick. Right. Richie, hey. Hey, you're not gonna believe where we are. Yeah, where are you? 'Cause we're all at the studio waiting for you. Okay, look, trust me, this is worth it. Yeah, well, it better be. Do you know how much Jordan fucked things up with Caleb last night? W... Wait, slow... slow down. What? The tour is off. How old are you? I'm 25. You look older. You're gonna have to really work for it. Girls like us, that's our cross to bear. Only gets harder. It's tough being the other one. I'm not sure what you mean. I don't mean anything by it. I get it. She's the one up front, and you're the one in back doing all of the work. Just like me. Well, we both work hard. Yeah, but you work just that little bit harder, right? I doubt she's staying up late at night, writing melodies and songs. Mm-mm. It is clear who's getting her beauty sleep. Damn. Shit! We get a lot of critters around here. You... you cut my finger. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, Jordan just got spooked by a little bug. She just cut my finger. Let me see. You done with your call? Yeah. Let's go. Where'd you two meet? The Bluebird Café two years ago. Yeah, we were waiting around all day to get onstage, and just sort of got to chatting and getting to know each other. We both were relatively new to town, but Jordan had been there a little bit longer doing the open mics. And then they called Jordan up as the last act of the day. And Leigh started crying. Only a little bit. I just couldn't catch a break. I had been trying to get onstage forever. And then Jordan invited me up with her. Yeah. Yeah. It was, uh, we winged it, but it was great. Yeah. It was meant to be. You know, I... I think we needed each other. So, you shared your coveted slot with a stranger? Yeah. Yeah, it wouldn't be the first time. Well, you know, I... I just, I... I felt so bad for her. Um, but luckily she's talented, so it all worked out. Yeah, she is something. I noticed that the moment you walked in the door. You have that... that extra something special, don't you? You're a star. Yeah, well, you know, um, people say that we both have a lot of talent, so... You got a boyfriend? I got... Oh, she has a boyfriend. You don't like her boyfriend? Yeah, she knows I don't like him. Well, I like him, so... Well, Harper doesn't like him. Who? Can you not do this right now, please? Richie Raleigh Jones. Okay. Richie Raleigh Jones? You know, what's funny is my sister had an older boyfriend. Couple of times. Always some asshole with power and prestige. Not her worst laid plan, although I hated it at the time. Interesting. Nobody wanted to hear what we had to say. Not in Nashville. But Hope, she always knew that you couldn't get what you wanted just 'cause you wanted it. She knew you had to strategize. Be ruthless. Sneaky. And, you know, that actually worked for a while. But what'd we get in the end? Constant pressure. Unmet expectations. Workhorses for a bunch of men that did not know what to do with us on the wrong side of 35. Screw them. You make incredible music. You inspired a generation of musicians. You did. But now I'm alone. Hope is gone. I tried to... I tried to help her. And now I just punish myself every goddamn day. I think we all feel punished without the Dutchess Sisters. - Yeah. Truly. - No, Harper, you... I mean, you can't blame yourself for Hope taking her own life. She did it in... in front of me, you know. It was truly awful. I mean... Would be awfully nice to let that go. That's her. Cremated. All right, enough, enough. Let's just... let's just lighten this up. Yeah. You know, if... if you're gonna be a star, baby, you better learn how to take a shot. Yes, ma'am. Let's have a toast to Hope. To Hope. To Hope. Watch it with this one. She cheats. Is that so? What's she do? She loses. Go. There you go. Ooh. ♪ 'Cause it's obvious... Ooh. ♪ 'Cause fools think alike ♪ Taking any bet ♪ It's just what we do Hello? Leigh? Miss Dutch? Hello? Yeah, they are something else. Wh... well, the singer, she is just like you. She stirred her drink, licked her finger. A little bitch. You know you are. And I love you for it. And you heard what she said about the shower? Oh, my. Just like you. This could work. This could really... What? You scared the shit out of me. God. Where were you? I woke up on the sofa in the living room. Wh... When did we put these on? I don't know. They're cool, though, right? Original tour shirts and pants. Yeah. Um, do... do you have your phone? Mm-mm. What... what time is it? Did we sleep till the afternoon? I don't know. This shirt stinks and I feel like shit. Does it? Yeah. That much liquor'll do that to you. Pacing yourselves, my ass. You two really tied one on last night. Leigh, you passed out. And then, Jordan, you were talking about driving, so I... I took your keys. Just wasn't right. God, I'm... I'm so sorry, Miss Dutch. I don't remember any of that. Yeah. No shit. You girls want a wash? - Yeah. - Well, um, no. No, I think we'll be going. But thank you so much for your hospitality. Um, I... I can't seem to find my clothes. They're in the laundry. They'll be done soon. You spilled whiskey all over you. You do not remember that? No. Mm-mm. I was thinking we could work on our song this morning. We can do that. Yeah. Oh, sure. Yeah. But maybe... maybe another time 'cause I think we've overstayed our welcome. You weren't welcome to begin with, dear. Follow me. You girls want to learn how to make it in Nashville, right? And you want to learn from the best, right? Well, it starts, it starts with wining and dining. I have an idea. I'm gonna go upstairs and get dressed, and you girls are gonna make me breakfast. Okay. Wh... what do you want us to make you? Surprise me. Okay. Come on. Okay. This is weird. Let's just... Let's go. I feel like making her breakfast is the least we can do. I mean, we got wasted here last night. Plus, I mean, it's not like we have any other options. Yeah, no, there are plenty of other options other than running around this weird Sunset Boulevard house in stinky shirts. Okay, what options? I know Caleb's not an option anymore. Yeah, Richie told me yesterday on the phone. He said that you guys slept together and now he doesn't want to do the tour. It's not 'cause I slept with him. Jesus. Wait a minute, you knew? You knew and you didn't tell me? Uh, I was gonna. Okay. Okay. So... so we can keep doing what we're doing and... and playing to midsized crowds in Nashville, or we can do something bigger. With Harper. Now, who's the one with a vision for the band? Perfect. You know how to scramble eggs? Yeah. Good. I'm tired. You're not gonna help? Nope. What is going? I... I don't... I don't like this, okay? I overheard Harper saying some, like, weird shit. Like what? I don't know. Like stuff about you. Really? Oh, my God, never mind. Oh, my God. Shit, they're rotten. I'm gonna be sick. Okay, well, we need to find something. No, no. Just stop. Okay, but we need to figure something out. I told you it wasn't gonna be enough. - Shut up. - Yeah. Shut up! That's right. I am extremely disappointed in you. How do you expect me to record a song with you if you can't do something simple like make me breakfast? I'm sorry, Miss Dutch. We... Well, I'm... I'm not. Um, thank you for your time, Miss Dutch, but I... I think this is obviously a bad fit, so we'll, we're just gonna... Jordan. No. Leigh. I think we're gonna go now. Please stay. Don't screw this up. She just threw a plate at our heads. And I'm asking you to stay. Don't go just 'cause it gets a little complicated. Jordan? Hey, Jordan, Jordan, look, look, look, look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... I just lost myself. You're right. I did not think about how empty my kitchen was. You know, after so many years just living out here by myself in the middle of nowhere... I... I forget what's expected of me. I... I just want to make sure that you and Leigh work as hard as I did. I want someone who cares about the artistry. You know, the work. And I think you do. I think you want to do something original. Yeah. I mean, yeah, of course. Yeah. You and me, we're so much alike. This really can't happen without you. High highs, right? All right, then. Ladies. Wow. I had some wild nights in here. Bet you she fucked Willie Nelson down here. What? What? You would. Liquid breakfast. Here we go. Bottoms up. Whew. Uh, Leigh, uh, not so fast. You girls didn't get the breakfast right, so, uh, I'm thinking I'll give you another shot. Oh. Another shot? That's right. Miss Dutch... You want the song or not? Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of things you got to do that you don't want to do to get on top. Isn't that right, Leigh? Uh, what do you mean? Richie Raleigh Jones? Isn't he old enough to be your daddy? Not quite. Hope had a lot of boyfriends that were pigs. Tell me, Jordan, is Richie a pig? I mean, he's not my favorite person. Yeah. You know, Jordan, you're gonna have to start telling us how you really feel, 'cause it's just not gonna work out any other way. I mean, if we're gonna be working together, then we just can't afford to have secrets. Um... Yeah, I... I don't, I don't like Richie. She knows that. I think he has bad ideas. I don't feel like it's about Richie at all. You talk about your vision for us. What is it? I think you know my vision, Leigh. I don't think I know your vision. You talk about your vision and... and getting us to the next level, but I don't think you have any real answers. Okay. Okay. Yeah. You girls finished? I want you to show me how you feel. What do you mean? You know, when Hope and I would get mad at each other, we'd have to find a way to... to let our anger out. So, we'd wrestle. Fight a little bit. Felt good. What? Go for it. It'll show me which one of you wants it more. Okay, come on. I... I mean, as mad as we get with each other, I... I would never hit Leigh. It's kind of fucked up. Not in a million years. Leigh, what the fuck was that? Jesus Christ. I... Hit me back. I would never hit you. I guess Leigh's the one who wants it more. Don't back out, like you always do. Or do I care more about the band than you do? You gonna quit just 'cause it got hard? I'm only here because I care about the band. And you. And... and our... our future. Ow. It fucking hurts! That's right. It hurts. Do it. Hit her. Stop moving! Stop. Ow! ♪ Some say I'm being harsh - ♪ Some say I'm being rash... - Go on. Show her how you feel. You think you're better than me? You think you're so much better just 'cause you write my songs! No, I don't! Yeah, you do! You think I'm just a pretty face. You think I'm dumb! I don't think that! You're not dumb! It takes a real PhD to suck Richie Raleigh Jones' redneck dick every other night. Well... seems like these two got some unresolved issues. Who the hell would be buzzing at my door? You girls invite friends? It... it might be Richie. And why the hell would that turd be at my gate? I... I told him where we were last night. All right, let's go. Come on. I thought you weren't a big fan of Richie. I'm not. Then it should just be Leigh and myself. Goddamn it. Leigh! Come on! Miss Dutch? Here. Here, change. Quickly. - Who is it? - Miss Dutch? Speaking. It's Richie Raleigh Jones. Well, that... that couldn't be better timing. I'm gonna buzz you in. Hey, do you, do you know where my phone is? It's not in here. What are you doing, Leigh? I see you. Complimenting my house, the way I look, my music. I know you. And you don't give a damn about her. I know what you saw down there, and... that couldn't be further from the truth, okay? Jordan... Jordan's my best friend. We're like sisters. Probably better than being a sister, because, you know, sisters can get all heated up over the littlest of things. It is a difficult relationship, to say the least. I know you blame yourself for Hope, but it's not your fault. Have you thought about, maybe, like, talking to somebody? I mean, I... I could help you find a therapist or s... Look at you. You're working me. Like you're... you're gonna help me find something? Like... like the way you found Jordan? - What are you talking about? - Tears? Tears at the Bluebird Café? So... so you tell me... how many times? How many girls before you picked her? I don't know, four or five? You caught me. What do you want me to say? She... she was great. She is great. Uh, but she wasn't getting anywhere and neither was I. And you should know more than anybody, you need a story. And that story, it worked for both of us. I'm not a bad person. You're not that good either. I miss Hope. I miss her every day, and I... I blame myself. But now, you're gonna help me fix it. Because, you see, you are Hope and Jordan is me. What does that mean? Oh, fuck your old balls boyfriend. Oh, my God. Huh. There he is. How you doing, Dick? Nice to see you, Miss Dutch. Been a while. Sorry to intrude on you like this. It's just that I haven't seen or heard from you since the night before last. I... I'm sorry. Uh, we sort of just kind of got carried away, having a good time. The girls just came by for some free advice on a whim. Nothing's free in Nashville, is it? Yeah, I've been trying to tell them that. I think they're starting to believe me. Dare I ask where, uh, Jordan is? She left. You know, but it's just my luck that you decided to come by right now. I... I actually need a favor from you, Richie. Would... would you mind sitting? Leigh, maybe get us some drinks. - Yes, ma'am. - Have a seat. I want to get back out there again. Hmm. Yeah. I want to... I want to do something new, a whole new take. I think it's time to get the Harper Dutch name back on people's lips. Well, I think I could help with that. Yes, I thought you could. And you have just the lady in your arsenal that's gonna help me do that. She's the real deal. - She's a real star. - Yeah. I've been telling people that for a long time. It's nothing. Well, hell, with the two of you, who the hell needs Jordan, right? And, Miss Dutch, I got to tell you, I think people are gonna be so excited to see you back out there on stage again. Especially after everything that you been through and all the rumors going around. I just... Rumors? What kind of rumors? I... I mean, it's... I just mean people talk. It's Nashville. Yeah. I... I didn't... I didn't mean, um, rumors, like, a... about you. Uh, well, folks were very sad. And then, uh, well, you, uh, disappeared from the world quite a while. I've been in mourning. - People don't approve of that? - Yes. Of course they do. I'm... I'm just saying that folks miss you. And what'd they say about Hope? They... they miss her, too. And I think everybody feels like it's... it's a damn shame what happened. Was a shame. We're empty. I'll go get us some more drinks. Oh. You read my mind. Hey. Here's to a new duo. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Richie, could I... could I offer you some pie? Sure. Jesus. How... how did you get out of the basement? What the fuck was that? Nothing. You just... you came in at a weird time. I knew you wanted to leave Torn Hearts. Just never expected you to lock me in a basement and trade me in for Harper Dutch. You know, I remember when you were just starting out, Dick. Just a little pipsqueak. Yeah. Was just a young, dumb farm boy kind of running around in the city. Sometimes it just seems like you're still rolling around in the mud. A little pig. I'm pr... pretty sure Harper killed Hope. What are you talking about? You don't even want to know what I saw down there. A... a secret room. Like a b... body parts. Fingers. I really do love this idea of you and Leigh together. I... I think it's fantastic. I am so excited. And if I'm gonna be honest with you, just in my personal, humble, professional opinion, I think it might be your best shot back in the mainstream after being gone all these years. Could it have been a joke? No. It's not a... a joke. I don't think so. Leigh, she's got something. She's got that stardust, that... that kind of stardust that Hope had. And then you, you're the tried-and-true one, ain't you? The strong old hand behind her. Good old Harper Dutch. Like, she probably didn't even want to record a song with us. She was just saying she wanted to record a song with us. She says a lot of shit, okay? She... she convinced us to beat the shit out of each other. Like, you don't think that's fucking weird? Well, you and me, we both know what it takes to make it in this business. And if there's you and there's me, and we're standing there behind Leigh... Well, goddamn, fuck, I think you're gonna be unstoppable. You know what I'm saying? Harper is sick. Okay? She's trying to turn us against each other. Jordan, come on. I mean, we obviously had some issues to work out before we got here. Hey, Dick, anyone ever tell you you talk too much? My ex used to tell me that all the time. You know what? I've got a fantastic idea for a song for you guys. Can you just listen to me, Leigh? Stop telling me to listen to you! I'm sick and tired of everybody bossing me around and telling me what to do. Today, I'm gonna do things my own way for once in my life. Okay, well, just believe me about what I saw. We should just go. That's what you want, isn't it? You want us both to leave so neither of us get to work with Harper. Yeah. I'm not going anywhere. She says that I have star power. Something you've always been jealous of. - I'm jealous, Leigh? - Stop. Don't... don't shush me, okay? Shut up. Just calm down. No, no. Fine, fine. I knew you wanted to jump ship on the band and me, so just do it! - No one's stop... - Ladies. Are you two arguing? You know, when we argue with each other, it's just not right. We all lose. You changed. You look great. And I see that, uh, that you made it out of the basement. You know, I was just talking to Richie, and he thinks Torn Hearts with Harper Dutch is a great idea. He does? Yeah, no. No, I heard what he said. It wasn't that. He said we need Jordan's artistry and Leigh's star power. And then, of course, y'all need me. So I was thinking maybe we could lay down part of that song that we were talking about, if y'all are still interested. I mean, I know I am. Yeah, well, yeah, I am, too. Hope I don't get in your way. Then don't. Um, where's Richie? Uh, is he gonna come and... You know, the reception is so bad in this house. He just had to step out and make a call. Come on, girls, let's go. This way. Walk this way. All right. Now, you wanted permission to use that microphone, so... so you go right ahead. Uh, Jordan, could you just move that out of the way, please? We're gonna... we're gonna put the microphone right there. That's where it sounds the best. That's right. Okay. Now, gather round. You ready, girls? What's the song? It's a song that, uh, that Hope wrote. It's the last one. We never recorded it. So, we're going to sing it a cappella. You girls will get it. You're just gonna follow along. All right? ♪ Never thought it would ever Sing with me now. ♪ I'm gonna die with your name ♪ On my lips Sorry. It was just so sad. It was gorgeous but sad. Oh! Come here, honey. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's all right. C... come on in here, Jordan. Yeah, let's just... we're gonna make it right. We're gonna... We're just gonna make everything all right. Yeah. You know, a lady's boudoir is where she keeps all her secrets. Wow, your room is beautiful. Oh, thank you, Leigh. And, uh, what do you think, Miss Jordan? Oh, I... I like it, too. Yeah. Almost there. She just talked to that photo. Don't talk shit. Do you want to be here or not? Of course I do, Leigh. I sang with Harper Dutch. I could die happy. Yeah, so could I. For my girls. Oh, my God, that's stunning. Mm-hmm. Wow. Thank you. Yes. You're gonna help me even it out. For Hope. What do you mean by that? You know what I mean. I... I don't, actually. Look at you. You look just like her. Come here. All right. I think you need just a little something. It won't be a lot. Yes, there you go. Open. All righty. Now blot. Beautiful. You clean up well. Just think about it. All three of us together. You girls are gonna help me. You ready to hear next steps? Yes. All of us? Yeah. You sure? You don't seem sure, Leigh. You know, it's funny. You act like you care about me and you care about the band... but you'd leave me in a heartbeat the second things got hard. Yeah, maybe I would leave. Hmm. I'm the songwriter. And I'm the one in front. What would you even sing? You'd be doing covers at open mics. You would be nothing without me. No, you're nothing without me. I could always go off on my own. Where would you go, Jordan? Who would do all the work for you, Leigh? You think what I do isn't work? I'm the one putting in the time at bars, chatting up every promoter. I entertain the crowd. I'm the face. That is work. It's not real work. Write your little songs, but you're always gonna have to write them for others. You're always gonna be one step behind the person who really brings it together. And that's you? Yeah. Yeah, it is. You finally see me. Oh, I see you. No. You don't. That's the problem. Well, you don't appreciate me. I don't think anyone will ever appreciate you as much as you appreciate yourself. Anything else? Your beauty will fade and you'll have nothing left. No one will want you. Not even Richie. And you're gonna end up bitter and alone. You're never gonna be anything more than someone else's backup. That's something Hope and I never could do. Tell the truth. The truth hurts. Hope brought you to me. I know it. She wants me to even things out. She wants me to have redemption. You girls ready to help me do that? Yes. I am. It hadn't been pretty this last number of years. Now, I can't, I... I can't tell you the... the number of nights that I've hurt. That I cried and... You just get lonely. I... I've been lonely. I get very lonely, Hope. Leigh? Leigh? What? I'm sorry. You know, they do say the right accessory can make an outfit! Even it out. Miss Dutch. Leigh, run! - Miss Dutch, what are you doing? - Leigh! Leigh, run! It's time for me to atone. Go! Go! Is it locked? Um, yeah, there's... Try... try the living room. Shit. - Or the... the window. - Okay, okay. Jordy? Yeah? Oh. Oh, man! D... don't... don't look. Go. Go. - There's bars. - Check the other door. It's locked! This one has bars, too! Where the hell you going, Miss Leigh? This is my house. I will tear it to shreds to get to you two. No! Bitch! You're gonna have to try harder than that. I think she's missing on purpose. What? She doesn't want to kill me. She had the chance. Oh, my... Oh, my God, you're right. You're right. She's fucking with us. She's... she been fucking with us since the moment we walked through that door. Now, we have to go to the basement. No, no. W... we'll be trapped. No, I... I have a plan. Okay? You... you have to trust me. Go! Go! Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this? I tried to tell you. No. Leigh. No, I... I'm not, I'm not... No. I'm not killing Harper Dutch. We have to do anything we need to do to get out of here. Take the gun, Leigh. Do you even know how to use this? I'm from Texas, Leigh. Of course I do. Look, I don't want to kill her. Okay? She's... she's my hero. Just don't make me kill her. Okay. Please. I promise. Um... Help me, Leigh. Oh. It's almost time. I promise. Harper. Harper, I'm in here. Har... Harper. - We're a team. - Harper. A good one. I mean, I just sing... It's all credit to Him. And very long showers. Oh, Harper's the real artist... I love singing in the shower. Hope. - I can attest to that. - We disagree sometimes. She wants to go one way and I want to go another. Oh, Hope. I... I know. I know it's time for me to atone. But we're in this together. We're a team. Hope. It's so good to see you. Oh, I couldn't do any of this without my sister. Leigh! Shoot her! I... I don't want to kill her! Then don't shoot to kill! Oh! Miss Dutch, let go of the gun. I'm just... I'm gonna... I'm gonna take the gun, Miss... We don't want to kill you. I'm not finished. I... I'm not finished. Hmm. Go find our phones. - No, I'm not... - I'm not leaving you. What's the matter? You don't trust me? Oh, do you trust me? I... I trust you, Leigh. I trust you. I saw you for who you were when you walked through my door. And now, I need you. I need... I need you now to help me finish. Just get the gun. Help me finish. Miss Dutch... talk to me. What do... what do you need to do to finish? Atone. I need... I need to atone. To... to atone for what? For what you did to Hope? You killed her. Right? I told you. You killed Hope? Why? She was gonna leave me. See, um... we hadn't toured for a while. We were expecting this, uh, this big grand reception at the Opry, but... ...we barely made it to 50 percent capacity. We were crushed. And then, the next morning, we were having breakfast here, and... and she admitted that she'd been working on some solo stuff. That the guys at the label had encouraged her. That she, uh, she said she wanted to go on tour alone and, uh, and... and buy herself a new house. Get herself a new life, basically. Without me. I just... I got so angry at her. And then, uh, I don't know what came over me. And then when I... when I see her face, after the, uh... after the fire rang out, I... She was so frightened. You know, I loved... I loved Hope, and I... I just wanted to... I wanted to keep her. Pieces of her. Our sales, they... they went through the roof that month. A sister in mourning. What a good story. They just love a story. I'm so sorry, Miss Dutch. You're sorry? Leigh, what are you talking about? Sh... she killed her sister. And then you two wound up at my doorstep. And I... I think Hope saw things differently. She... she... then she realized that I could atone. With you. How do you atone? You have to make it. You have to do everything that Hope couldn't do. And Jordan has to go. I have to go. Go? Go where? What are you talking about? You're the one who walks away with a story. So you can be a star. You're... you're not... you're not buying this. Right? Leigh. Leigh, honey... put down the gun. Leigh, what are you doing? I'm not killing Harper Dutch. I told you. She has a plan. What the hell are you talking about? Low lows. What? No. Miss... Miss Dutch, you sit down! Sit down right now! We are gonna even this out. Sit down, Miss Dutch! You're me and I'm you. So, we both need to atone. I haven't done anything wrong. We're gonna do it at the same time. This doesn't make any sense! On three, I'm gonna say "go." It has to be at the same time so that I'm sure that it can happen. I will shoot you, Miss Dutch! Good! Leigh, tell her to stop! One! She's gonna listen to you! Two! This... this won't do anything! This is for Hope! Thr... I... I know you didn't want to kill her, Leigh, but... she... she was pointing a gun at me, and I thought that... Leigh? But you did it anyway. I knew you would. Kill her before she killed you. She told you to wait until three, so you could go together. But I did it for you. Now you can. Leigh. Can you call... Oh, I'm gonna call somebody. What's the matter? You don't get it? Hmm? This is my story now. She was right. My idol, she traps us down here. She kills her sister. My boyfriend. My best friend and band mate, who died bravely trying to save me. Oh, Jordan, that's the story. That's the story. Oh. Oh, I thought I'd lost you. You know, she knew. She knew you were gonna kill me. It was me or you. It's always been me or you. It doesn't have to be that way. Aw, honey. Hmm? But it does. Plus, not like we can do much now, right? Oh. Ooh, ooh. Sorry. I'll miss you. We did it. We're gonna be stars. I won't let you down. I promise. ♪ We have high highs ♪ Low lows Jordan! So, you knew Torn Hearts and Harper Dutch quite well? Yes, ma'am. Talented, wonderful women. Lives cut too short. A senseless tragedy. It's to my understanding you're bringing some of Torn Hearts' music back to life, in tribute to Jordan Wilder and Leigh Black house. It's actually a tribute to all four women. Lucky enough, my team was able to get the last known recording of Harper Dutch and Torn Hearts, titled "Go." And I'm happy to be playing that for you tonight. ♪ So sad, so sad it is We're like sisters. I know what you saw down there, and... that couldn't be further from the truth, okay? Jordan...
