There'll be loads of pissed up blokes there. Married blokes are the easiest What if I get groomed? Janet, this could be the making of you First I think we need a bit of a chat. You look like a sofa. You'll never have a holiday romance looking like this. You're stuck in an '80s time warp. You've worn the same shite for years. Well mom and dad always say I look lovely. No offense, but they're hardly style gurus, are they? Your mum's blind and your dad sure as hell no Calvin Klein. You've never had a boyfriend, have ya? Christ, me best sort years were in me 20 have you no pride? I've always wanted a boyfriend. I've always wanted to find true love, like in me Bollywood films. Then you're going to. I'm gonna transform ya. Yeah, clothes, hair, walk, talk, the full Monty. I'm gonna take you from stiff to sex siren overnight. Think Sandy in Grease, she scrubbed up well. She went out before she banged Jon Travolta. See? Do you really think it could work? It's a big job, Janet. But I'm willing to try.

Oh my gosh, whatever gave you that impression? The accent. I can't quite place it. I live in higher Bolton, but mother's French. That's why I'm called Janet. Anyway, what is it you do in Higher Bolton, Janet? Oh I'm a fashion stylist to the stars of Higher Bolton. And in your spare time? Oh I just love the theater. Les Miserables, East and Stormy, I read a lot too. Heat, Closer magazine, there's nothing I don't know about the show biz. Come on you, we've got men to find. Look no further, you found one.

Oh hello. What's this? Hey, need your ashtray emptied. Di, that's their father. Oh yeah, I can see the resemblance. Who is this vile creature? Oh why'd you neck in, love? It were only a joke. Right, I think that's enough. Maybe it's time you took your friend back to the caravan. Oh f-f-f-fuck off, wizard boy. I'm so sorry. Let's give a big hand to Lionel, Vinyl and the Lovehandles! Well done boys, much better than last week. What's gotta into you, Di? You were so horrible to my new friends. Jon was really upset. Posh boy? I've done you a favor. He's a scrawny stuck up little turd. I don't care. I like him. You've gone and spoiled everything. Oh boohoo, Janet. There's plenty more fish in the sea. Good morning, campers! Monday, it's tug of war. Mums and sisters, come on dad, give it a tug. Opportunity knocks. Good day to you. Mornin' Chris. How are you this morning? Good. Good morning. Hiya, boujour. I owe you an apology. What? I was offhand with you last night. B-b-but my anger was with your friend and not you. That's all right, no harm done. Your mother is staring. Well that's her default setting, don't worry. Is that all you're having? Can't eat like a horse and work in the fashion industry. What? Oh nothing. I think Uncle's taking quite a shine to your friend. Don't reckon Andy would be pleased. Andy? My brother, he and Diana are practically engaged to be wed. Come on Janet, we're off. Chris has offered to give us a tour of the site. And then him and his mate Jason are gonna take us to the beach. What? He's in kebab game, he's got six Jason Donavan's. He's loaded. Actually, um Janet has kindly agreed to join me and my family for afternoon tea. I have? You are? Okay, all aboard the Craven express. Uh Janet's a bit busy so it's just you and me. Oh. I'm sure you'll have jolly good fun. And you can tell Andy all about it when you get home. Hope you have a spiffing time. That was tense. Am I really invited for afternoon tea or were you just? Come Jon, there's no smashed avocado, again. I hope you don't mind, mother but I've invited Janet to join the famil for our afternoon tea. Ah, delightful. Yes, how very delightful. Come.

So um, we come back every year to celebrate his anniversary. We lost him on the treasure hunt. He just took off but they found father just a foot away from the treasure. Always took it so seriously. More tea, Janet? Thank you ever so. I'm a coffee addict too. But we simply couldn't fit our deluxe gold plated coffee machine juicer combined in the Merc. So Janet, just what is it that your parent's do? Mother's a dress maker. For the stars of Higher Bolton, I presume? She's ever so posh too. Likes royalty and nice things like that. And Papa grows competition vegetables. Funny shaped carrots mostly. Fascinating. We have a frightfully large vegetable garden, two horses and a hot tub. We too have a pool in the garden. We blow it up every summer. Of course you do. Any interests, hobbies? I love children and animals and charit I want to help the world, give peace a chance. And just, where were you educated, dea Mother. Jonty and Minty went private. Jonty can play three instruments and speak four languages. Thank you mother. So just where is this Higher Bolton place you speak of? Up north. Near Ramsbottom. Bottom de ram. Never heard of it. This is as far north as we dare come. Mother. Minty, you're going traveling this year, aren't you? Island hopping around Thailand. Yes, I'm awfully excited. No package holidays for a smithe Crave Yes, I really can't wait to see Ko Samui, Ko Samet, Phi Phi. Friends of yours? You'll be familiar with all these places, being the seasoned traveler that you are Please, may I use the bathroom? Yes, of course. First left behind the trophy cabinet. No sonnets, mind deary. Oh don't scowl Jonty. You've heard what it's like up there. Gray skies, dirty pavements, unburied dead. Yes, all right, if you say so. Really you two, surprised you've been taken in. I'm so sorry about mother, she's a nightmare. Quite all right, we're just different pedigrees, that's all. You know, I think she sees you as a threat. Me, a threat? Give her a jolly big hug and tell her I understand. Um, probably best not, she's not much of a hugger. Anyway, Janet, I was hoping to find out more about you. Is there anyone special back home? Just casual romances, broken a few hearts, let me tell you but, no, no one special, yet. What? You sounded just like Diana then. Ah. Oh god, what my light? I shall have you done for assault madame. Help, phone the police! I'm sorry, presumptuous of me. Shall we? Your mother must miss you father terribly. God no, they were awful together. She just misses the money. Janet, uh, I have a confession to make. You're not gay, are you? Well no. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I. Janet, it's more a confession about my family. You see, I'm, mother is all flash, no cash. All of father's assets were sold when he died so now there is nothing left. But the gold plated? No, we don't have one. And the pool? We don't have one, not even a blow up one like yours. In honesty, it's overrated. I think the point is, she pretends to be something she's not. Is there anything you'd like to share with me, Janet? I, I um, I don't really like rock. No. I um, I don't like the way it presents itself. All packaged, hard edges, manufactured, styled. When in fact it's actually just a sweet, lovely thing that makes me feel very happy. I'm sorry, enough about sweet things. How on earth do you know Diana? Di's always looked out for me. School was miserable. Ah yes, boarding school was the worst, eh? Ah yeah, the pits. But Di, Diana fought in my corner. And when I say fought, I mean she really fought those bullies down hard. And even knocked some out. So Diana must have gone to the same boarding school as you then. I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry, I just. Don't apologize. Look, all you need to know is Diana has been my guardian angel. It doesn't seem that way. One shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. One tries not to. She's my friend, she's the only friend I've ever had. And I may be the only friend she has. We've always been there for each other, so. Ow! Careful with my money makers, you. You're a masseur? Not quite, I play the piano. And you get paid? I get by, you know, the odd gig here and there. I'd love to hear you play. Morning campers, hope you've had a great breakfast. Don't forget the battle of bikini babes is tonight, 7:30 PM in the lounge. Fun for everyone. Especially the dads. All right, I'm off to meet Chris. And before you start, there's nothin' going on, he said he's gonna make me a star. Anyway, what am I supposed to do all day when you're off galivating with posh boy Sit by the pool on me own? What about our Andy? What about him? Look, I'm only hanging out with Chris cause I need all the friends I can get if I'm gonna win this beauty pagent. It'll break Andy's heart if he knew you were carrying on like this. Like what? So I flirt with him, perhaps a bit of flash, it's not doin' anyone any harm. Bit like you pretending to be all fancy for Jon. The end justifies the means, hey Janet? Remember, you're lucky I've come here at all. Tada! Hold the applause, I haven't played for you, yet. One second. One minute. That should do it. Hey! Hey! Hey! The odd gig every now and then. Well, the odd concert hall fairly frequently. My insides have exploded. Some may say you're the dog's testicles. Thank you. My oh my can you dance. So Diana, Janet tells me you're quite the veteran at beauty contests. Well, won a few in me time, it must be said. And you're going to win this one, aren't you, Diana? Well, we'll see. Piss it, you said. Oh gosh, you'll never guess what happened? Your balls have dropped. Uh, well, no. But Uncle has only gone and made me one of the judges. No way. I'm not exactly sure why, it's really not my area of expertise. Oh never. A lethario like you. Wanna show, one with be fine. Now as the playboy I'm sure you are, Jonty, I'm sure you know what to look for in a woman. Let me give you a few tips. It's all about the real women. - Sure. - Touch me babes. - Oh wow. - I'm all real. Welcome to the battle of the bikini babes. Oh, wish me luck. I'll need it. That's my cue to go, so. I hope to see you later, Janet. You know, I think my brother likes you First up and let's hope she's locked the back door, it's Brenda from Blackpool. And hold on to your hats and your coats, it's Donna from Jonagrotes. And she's born to be wild. This one from Monty Bree. And who's this on the scene? It's Paulie from Milton Kings. Just when you thought life was free, it's Candy from Common Tree! Let's get it on, it's Diana from Higher Bolton. She has issues, doesn't she? I wish I had her confidence though. I wish I could just get up there like that. Must feel so good. Well what's to stop you? You realize there's a talent contest tomorrow, right? I don't have any talents. Everyone has a talent in something. I can see you going home with the top. Well done, Ronway love, well done Brenda, lovely scarf. I can see you going home with the top prize to be honest with you. Well, what you reckon? Oh you were very energetic. There's plenty more for you left in the tank. Oh. You all right, darling? Yeah hmmm. How was it? Judging all those stunnas. Well, well, well it's a shame that you weren't competing. I'm serious. Diana reckons I could enter one of those plus size competitions. Regional though, not national. I better go for the big announcement. Hey Minty. Hey. Oh Minty, your brother's dreamy. He's the world's biggest geek, but I love him. Ladies and gentlemen, guess what? What? It's only the moment you've all been waiting for. As we crown this year's Craven's best bikini babe winner! Good luck ladies. Judges, have you made a decision? Uh, uh, uh yes we have. You heard it folks, let's have it, drumroll please! Yes, I can confirm that the votes are in, uh and w-w-w-w-winner of the battle of the bikini babes contest is. Thank you, thank you I'd love to dedicate this win to all my fans. God, I love every single one of you. No, Diana, you've come second. Second? No, no, I'm a winner. I've never won second in my life. No, no, that tiara, that's mine. I demand a recount! Trailer trash. Oh fuck off. This is you, you Harry Potter, you spiteful. Oh get off me, this is an absolute farce Get off! Harry Potter? Let's hear it for our winner, Candy! - Di? - Andy? Hey what's up, I've been trying to ring you all day, why haven't you answered? I'm sorry. I've been worried sick, is everything all right? No, no, it's not. I'm dyin' here. Dyin? You've got to come rescue me, Andy. I hate it here. I hate Janet. She's changed, Andy. All she does is bugger off with her poin of a boyfriend and leaves me on me own all day. Uh boyfriend? She's with some stammering stuttering knob head. But weren't that the plan, Di? The reinvention and Janet findin' a fell It's not all about Janet. What about me? No one gets how special I am anymore. You know, it's always me and people fallin' in love with me. The boys want me, the girls want to be m Di, lovely, you're not as young as you used to be, flower and maybe it's time to slow it down, you know, relax a little. Oh so even you're turnin' on me. You're saying that I'm a deluded old has been. If you loved me, you'd come and get me right now. I can't. Don't you even care? No I've had seven pints of beer down at the club, I couldn't drive you if I wanted to. Oh, it's like that is it? While the cats away. Hey, hey, hey. The only reason I'm drownin' in me sorro is cause the love of me life is away from me. Come and get me first thing in the mornin' then. Love, look, you've got to stay, for Janet's sake. This might be the only chance at romance she'll ever have. Get in that bloody van and come and get me right now or we're over. What and get caught by the police? Lose me license, get the sack. Sweetheart, I love you more than hell but I'm not gonna get you a diamond ring on the doll, I. Oh forget it then. If your bloody driving license and job's more important than me than we're done. You shove that bloody ring up your ass. Di. Ha! Second prize Diana. Second prize! Let's say we have another couple of minutes rest and then make one final swoop of the cab before. Okay. But I've never seen her go off on one like this. I might give Andy a ring, I mean Andrew, a ring and tell him what's going on. What's the point? You'll only worry him. Well I guess it's so. What? Nothing. Let's talk about you. Me? Well, the other day when you asked me if there's anyone special in my life. Well there's never been anyone, ever. But what about you? Is there anyone special back home? Well I've always been hopeless of romance. There's never been anyone special. Until now. You didn't stutter once then. No I feel very comfortable with you. Does one feel the same? Oh, yeah this is the best week of my life. I could happily stay here forever. What's wrong? Let's go and find Diana, shall we? Do you think I'm beautiful, Chris? You are off the scale. More beautiful than Fandy Candy? You're one of those women, you get better with age. You're like a fine bleu cheese. Well why didn't I win then? You're a winner in my eyes, hm? Oh. Come on, let's go back to my place, seal that deal. I can't. Why? I've got a boyfriend back home. He's not here. Do you just want me for sex, Chris? Can't we just have a cuddle? A cuddle? Who wants to see my crabs? Go to the new rock pool feature and you can see the little critters. And it's that time of the year again. The Kevin Craven memorial treasure hunt! Heya Janet, where you off to? Just into town, doin' a bit of shoppin Oh give me five minutes, I'll come with you. Unless you're meetin' penfold. Actually, I'm meetin' up with Minty. Minty?

Don't worry about me. I'll just stay here on me own again. Why don't you come join me for a bit, handsome? I think I can spare you five minutes, gorgeous. So what do you get up to when you're not slavin' after me? I, what? When you're not runnin' about after me what you get up to? Sorry, just a. Oh, oh no, I'm drownin'. You can stand up there, love. It's three foot deep? Where's the lifeguard. I'm a damsel in distress. Oh. Cheers, mate. Save me a job. Get off, get off! I don't get it. You've always been such a strong swimmer You okay? I would be, if you stopped pissin' off all the time. I thought you wanted me to leave you alone. I wanted a break from babysittin' ya. You repay my kindness by buggering off with that boring Jon and his sister. Jon's not boring, he's perfect. He gets me, he likes me. Who does he like, hm? Janet or Janet. Don't spoil it, Di. Come tonight to the talent contest. I'd love for me two favorite people in the world to get to know each other. He'd just end up fancing me, wouldn't be fair on you. No offense Di, but you're not exactly every man's cup of tea. Gotta give them what they want. Men have sex on the brain, Janet. Jon's different. He thinks I'm fun and sweet and we don't need to do that. Are you kidding yourself? He'll be thinkin', nice girl, frigid. Do you really think so? Trust me. You're gonna need to give him more than a kiss at the end of the night to keep that one keen. But I wouldn't know what to do. No shit. That's why you're lucky you've got me. By the time I'm finished with ya, no red blooded man's gonna be able to resist ya. Hello, oh ladies, I have flowers. Oh, for me? Oh god, what are these? These are actually for Misses Brown. What? For Janet? For me? This lady. I'll leave you to it. Oh don't forget tonight, eight o'clock, our famous staff onsite boy band will be playing. I'll be Robbie. See you later. They're from Jon. Says he hopes to see me after the show. Right. Let's slap this bitch up.

You listen to me, she's special, our Janet, I know her better than anyone. I protect her. She's a big girl. You can say that again. Poisonous creature. It seems to me, the only person that Janet might need protecting from is you. You what? You ruin her confidence. Bollocks. I'm the one that makes her feel good about herself. You're the one that ridicules her every opportunity. Forever criticizing. Ah, she told you this, did she? When you were out shoppin'? I mean, not in so many words but. Why are you trying to take her off me? She's not a possession, she's not yours to own. She's a free spirit. Oh, I've heard it all now. Our Janet, a free spirit? You might be surprised. News just in, we've got a late entry, folks.

Now, let's hear from the winner, let's hear from our lovely winner here. Now, how do you feel bein' the winner? - Mint! - Mint, ladies and gentlemen. Well, this is your moment, my darling. Would you like to say a few words? Well, first of all, I'd like to thank Minty for helping me pick out my costume and I'd like to thank the judges for voting for me and but most of all, I'd like to thank my cousin, Di, Diana, and I'd be nothing without he Where is she? Entree? What you waiting for, big boy? Um. Over 20 candles. W-w-what are you doing? Janet, no, no, no get off, get off me. What's wrong, what's the matter? I can't do this. Why, what have I done wrong? I thought you liked me. I do like you. B-b-but this is cheap and trashy. You see, I feel like I've been with Dian Who are you, Janet? Because you've got two different personalities and at least three different accents. One moment you're so sweet and the then next, you're a woman possessed. I just don't understand you. I think I should leave. No, don't! Please let me explain. What do you want? Diana, I want you to leave Janet alone You're, you're dragging her down. How old do you think I am? Can we talk about Janet for five minutes? How old? Do you think I'm pretty? On a scale of one to ten, you can say te A six. A what? And a half maybe. And our Janet? Oh she's a definite 10. Nobody wants me anymore. Oh no, no, Diana, I'm sure that's not the case. Please don't cry. I know for a fact that Janet adores you and Andy, Andy probably loves you very, very much. You're not alone. It's going to be okay, all right? Why are you trying to kiss me? What, I mean? See, what'd I tell you, Janet? All men are bastards. Janet, I, I. Did you really think she was Janet de Brown, did ya? No, she's just plain old Janet Brown, isn't that right, sweetheart? Fashion stylist for the stars? Try shelf stacker at Martin's Mini Mart. She lives in a council house with her mum and dad. She's a 30 year old virgin for Christ sake. Listen to me, Diana. Janet is not the same as you. Oh whatever. Janet? Janet? Dad? It's me. I wanna come home, now. What's going on? Just talked to Diana on the phone telling me she's on her way home on the train. Bloody hell Janet, what's up? What's going on, dad? Nothin' if I know son. So, what's happening, Di? Now's happening. It's just Janet. She felt for some Hooray Henry, scared him off of course and then got all emotional and wanted to come home early. You know what a soft shite she can be. I wasn't gonna stay there on me own, was I? What with all them horny blokes about. Besides, I really missed ya. Bollocks. Oh. How long's this gonna go on? Leave your sister alone. No, there's happening that Janet and Diana are not telling us. So come on, spit it out. 'Cause this silent treatment's doin' everybody's head in. Is that your answer to everything, Janet Shove a sausage into your gob! Oy you sound just like Di! Can I come in? I'm not here for me, I'm here for our Andy. I think you should be honest with him and tell him what happened with, with, with Craven's. When you found me and J-J-Jony boy having a feddle. He deserves to know the truth. Or else what Janet? What if I don't tell him, you're gonna tell him? Is that what this is all about? I thought I was your mate. How could you do that with Jon? Knowing how I felt about him? I didn't do anything apart from being beautiful. I mean, I'm surprised he kept his hands on me as long as he did. Stop. I don't wanna hear anymore! You're cruel, Diana. You told me my life would change but I was better off before. Not happy but happier. Not that you care. But I do, I really do. I've not been myself, you see. You see there's something I need to tell you. What? I've only gone and got myself pregnant No! Why, why? I love him, I have to go! No, daft head! No, you silly cow! Janet, come back! Janet, come back! Has something gone on between you and Di? No. Are you sure? I've just been 'round to her house and she won't even answer the door to me Might be the time of the month, son. You know the like. Is there something you're not telling me, Janet? Something that went on at the holiday camp? Not happened, shut up. You'd tell me? If it happened? Of course she would. Now will you shush, this is the bit where they found out she's having an affair. I'd like to book a termination. Yeah, yeah, fine. Uh, no. No, I'll be comin' on me own. Right, this is the place that booked Janet's caravan. And it's closed down. Only closed on Mondays. So what now, brother? We just sit and wait 24 hours for it to open? If only I could remember the name of that mini market that Diana mentioned Well maybe we should just visit every mini market in Bolton. Minty, you are a genius, that's exactl what we'll do! I, uh. Does Janet Brown work here? Okay, bye! Does Janet Brown work here? This is going ever so silly now, Jonty We've been in practically every mini market and corner store in about a 10 mile radius. Let's go home now. No, I can't just give up. I've never seen you like this before. So willful and determined. You really think Janet is the one? Yes. The only one. And she makes me feel like I've won first prize in the greatest competition on earth every time I look into her eyes. I'm so sorry. I wish, well, I wish I could give you Janet. Oh my god, Jonty. Look who it is! Diana? What are you two posh bastards doing here? I, I've. Oh spit it out. I've come to profess my love for Janet And to explain that dreadful misunderstanding. Well tough. You're too late. She's done one. Done one, sis? Yeah, she flew to Magalov this mornin' she's gonna find herself a nice Spanish hunk. So you might as well piss off back to your posh palace. There's none here for you, sunshine. Come on, Jonty. Don't twist the knife anymore, Diana, yeah? I were lying. She's at work. What, where? Martin's Mini Mart. Martin's Mini Mart, that was it!
