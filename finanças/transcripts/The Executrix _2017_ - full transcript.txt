Could you forgive me? Survivors. Survivors look back and see omens, messages they missed. I have regrets. I knew you were no longer safe. I had seen what was to come. We were a family. How did we lose the good given to us? Look, mommy, I'm drawing an eye. Let me see. It's beautiful. You know the eye is the key to the portrait. Mommy. Are you okay? Hi. Did you eat today? - Yeah. - What? The usual. I had coffee. Bagel. That's not enough food. I had the dream again, Michael. But this time it was different. It happened while I was awake. Okay. What have you got there? It's a new project I'm working on with the class. They're Rorschachs. I've got it. Delivery for 2A. Second floor, apartment B. I have a person-to-person delivery for Rossetti. It's me. That's my maiden name, yes. Here. - Thank you. - Thank you. Have a good night. What's this? Mr. Fraiberg, as I was explaining to your secretary on the phone, there's been some kind of mistake. My mother, Carlotta Rossetti, she died over 30 years ago. This is a death certificate. It was issued yesterday. It was your mother's desire that you become the sole beneficiary and executrix of Vezza. Vezza was her estate in Tuscany. The casket and Thursday's funeral proceedings are all provided for here. You will also be inheriting your mother's rank, Marchesa di Vezza. Now if you decline to perform these tasks, control of the estate will revert back to your father. My father? Mr. Fraiberg, if this estate belonged to Carlotta, why did he control it? Ms. Rossetti did not possess the capacity to manage her estate. I should tell you, in confidence, that the Mortimers have also expressed interest for this painting. Very good choice. Why did you tell me my mother died when I was a little? Excuse me for a moment. Wait for me here. - Alright. - You have a coffee here, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Why did you tell me my mother died when I was little? Sometimes, as parents, we hide some things from our children to protect them. You hid my mother to protect me. Your mother was a very sick woman, Isadora. After you were born, it started. They said it was postpartum psychosis. But it never went away, never. It got worse and worse. She was increasingly violent, became dangerous to herself and to all around her, especially you. I don't remember any of it. Listen, I wanted you to grow up unburdened. So rather than telling a child the truth, I thought... we all thought it was better to tell you she was gone. How did she die? She hung herself. I'm sorry, darling. I'm so sorry. Isadora, please, don't go to Vezza. You must go on with your life. Let me handle the old Carlotta's estate and problems, I do this. My mind is made up. I'm going. Okay, okay. Okay. Next week I'll be in... in Geneva, and then I'll... I'll see family and help... Shut up. Isadora. I've been lied to my whole life. Can you imagine how that feels? Can you put yourself in my shoes? Yes, I can. I think your father just wanted to do what was best for you. You've been talking to my father? Yes, about the inheritance. Look, we don't know what any of these assets are worth or... or what this is worth or what this is worth. It's not about the inheritance. I need to find out who my mother was. I was ten, I was living with her. I don't even remember her face. This is my only chance. Yes, I know. We'll get through this together. Yeah. I love you. I love you, too. Gonna ask him. - We are lost. - Lost? - Yeah. - You arrived. Wow! Mommy, you're a princess! Holy shit. I... I coming. Grazie. There's no one here. Hello. Hello. Look at you. A lady now! And so beautiful. You remember me? No? I'm Angelica. You don't remember? Angelica? Welcome home. Hello. I look after your mother when she was your age. Everybody used to call her, Isadora, tessoro. It means sweet. Are you sweet, too? I've been waiting for this moment so long, and now here you are. If only it were happier times. - You must be starving. - Sure. Ew! My mother was an artist. Like you are. Much better artist. The celebration of the founding of the castle. Legendary. Artists, painters, even Luchino Visconti's been here. Which one of these is Carlotta? Marchesa refuse photograph. Lunch is served. Come. This is a picture of me when I was a child. Right. 1976. Look. Wow. Jordy, look at that. It's just like you. Her collection is incredible. All of them gifts from artists who used to stay here once. Do you know my father well? No, I just see him when clients... when clients visit. Vezza is a painful place for him. Angelica, I don't remember my mother very well. Very little. But you were always here with her. Yes, I was. When you went away, your mother was not herself anymore, always silent. It was like lights went out. She didn't want to see anyone. Only me. Michael, what happened to me here when I was a child? Did my father tell you anything? Something I don't know? Hey, what do you say we get some sleep? Okay? We've got a really big day tomorrow. Alright. Cheese! Mommy, a dog! Thank you. I can still see you and your mother here, laughing. We're laughing? Always. Angelica, can you tell me how many people work here? Well, I don't really know. I just take care of the house. I see. I thought the property-line ends at those hills. No, it stretches as far as the eye can see. Looks much larger than what her father described. I think we should go back. There's much to do before the reception. This is the oldest part of the ground. Some say older than Rome. This was a church? No. A place of worship, for nonbelievers. Before the Vatican took over and gave it to the Rossettis. What happened to the people who lived here? The nonbelievers? They were shown the light. Rodolfo. He's hunting for boars. They are all so young. Mommy, are we going to be buried here, too? Why isn't she being buried? My mother said she wanted a casket in her will. No. Just one. - We met once before. - We have? We had the pleasure of watching the Marchesa take you riding. The Ciardullos deliver horse feed to Vezza and other estates. Perhaps you haven't heard. But we now own the Felice Cavallo Supplies. We have been in touch with your father, Arthur. With my father? About your plan for Vezza. My plans for Vezza? This is definitely not the time... And not the place... But, while we're here, it makes sense to sit down, no? - Hi. - It's my husband, Michael. - Michael. Pleasure. Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Sorry for interrupting. Sweetheart, have you seen Jordy by chance? No. I'll go look for her. - Okay. - You wait right here. Okay. - Sure. Yeah. - Ciardullos. I'll see you later. I heard a lot about you guys. Yeah, we heard a lot about you, too. Yeah. And I... I saw another one of you floating around here. Thank you. Your hands, reminds me of Carlotta's hands. You used to know my mother? She saved my life. I was a lost in a haze of booze and Baccarat. Carlotta pulled me out. She rescued me from myself. Before destroying us both. I could have saved her. So you haven't seen her in a while? But it sounds like you were close to her. No? You were very close to her. Not long after you left, the gates to Vezza were closed. The staff claimed it was Carlotta's wishes. Isadora, I think it's your moment. Coming. We speak again, yes? Yes. Thank you. No. I'm sorry. I'm... I didn't know I... I had to do this. So, you all knew my mother so well, more than me, no? Incredible work with my mother. All these years with her, I wasn't here. My husband, Michael. To Carlotta Rossetti! To Carlotta Rossetti. To Carlotta Rossetti. No, I spoke with a lot of people today. No one said my mother was crazy. They all loved her. All of them. They're eulogies. What are they gonna say? You know, if she was really anything like that, the way they were going on about, then where was she all these years? Why didn't she ever reach out? Maybe she was prevented. Think about it. I'm thinking about it. Your father is on the phone. I can't talk right now. Tell him I'm not here. I'll take it in here! Yeah, you take it. Everything is in order. Do you need something else before we go on the weekend? No, thank you. We're all set. Hey, hon, we're gonna go down to town. See you in a bit. Mommy! Mommy! I hate you. Mommy. Mommy! Get off me. I hate you. I don't want to go. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! No. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Sometimes you gotta try new things to know what you like, right? Mamma mia, what a pizza. But you know I like Pete's Pizza. There is no Pete's Pizza here, sweetheart. Why did you leave me? Why? Honey, we just went out to grab a few pies. Are you okay? What' going on? Nothing. Talk to me. Jordan. Michael! Wake up. Michael, please wake up. Wake up. I see something. Come with me, baby. Wait, wait. Okay. I don't know, maybe... maybe one of the staff. How? There's no way out. You think maybe... Maybe what? Maybe I imagined it? I didn't say that. Angelica... Last night I found a room upstairs. It was closed up. Why? The doctors. They tell us to keep the door locked. It was painful for your mother. I don't understand. Please tell me. That room, it was your room, before you left. From then on, it's always been closed. Come. Now that your mother is dead, it's up to you to decide whether to open this door... ...or not. Mommy. Jordan. Come on, let's go play. Hey. Let's play. Okay, Marco Polo. Five, four, three... Come on. Two, one. Marco! Polo! Marco! Polo! Marco! Marco! Polo! Marco! Polo! Marco! Marco! Jordy! Go inside. Strega... Old tradition... Many of the people had called Carlotta this... The whole town... they were terrified of her. Accused Carlotta of premozione maligne. Evil premonitions. Why? They thought she could see the future. You must understand, there is a long history of superstition here. Vezza, you know, was a haven for the Heretics. Fleeing the inquisition. When the church caught up with them, this area became known as The Killing Fields. There is blood in this soil. Having done away with the infidels, the Vatican gave Vezza over to the Rossetti family in appreciation. You mean that my family was involved in this? Carlotta was deeply pained by this heritage. Drew convinced her family was cursed. She believed there was something else here... taking hold of her. So you're saying that my mother wasn't delusional? She was not crazy? I'm saying Vezza is a dangerous place for these kind of beliefs. I believe your mother wanted to protect you, Isadora. Protect me from what? From something she saw. I saw something, too. No, signore, I don't think she knows anything. Make sure she stays that way till I arrive. I know. I know. Come. Come. Come. Slow. Slow. What did you do? Hey, honey. This one is for dinner. Go brush your teeth. But it's not even close to bedtime. - Go brush your teeth, go. - Jordy, go. - We need to call the police. Now. - Shhh. The police? Why? The lies. They're all lying. The urn? The cremation? You really believe that was a mistake? I know what happened to my mother, Michael. They kept her prisoner. They kept her prisoner, they tortured her. They drove her crazy. They covered it up. - Who? - All of them. Look. I found this in Angelica's room. This, this was her dress. You broke into her room? This is my house. What is the matter with you? You think I'm going crazy, hmm? Isadora, you need to rest. Yeah? Well, I've been resting my whole life, Michael. I'm awake now. When are you gonna wake up? When are you gonna wake up, fuck up? Shhh. You're completely polarizing that child in there. You're unraveling everything we tried to achieve here. I've worked too hard for this shit. So, what do you want me to do? What I want you to do is I want you to lay down. I want you to sleep. I want you to relax. Okay? Okay, I will. You're making me fucking crazy. Stop! Please. Isadora, signora, can you hear me? She found Marchesa's body. What? The workers. They lie to us. They told us she was cremated. What does that mean? Marchesa committed suicide. She cannot be buried in hallowed ground. She's a lost soul. That's why. Come. Come. Hurry. Hurry. They killed my mother. They killed my mother. They killed my mother. I know what you know. - You don't know anything. - Why you kill my mommy? You killed my momma. No. You have to leave me here. I don't want you to stay. You're a murderer. You see who you are. You are a Marchesa now. You see? And I hope you don't suffer what she had suffered. Murderer. Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael! - What's wrong? What is it? - She killed my mother! She killed my mother! - Michael... - Slow down. Okay, okay. Okay, listen to me. Listen to me, baby, listen. Your mother wasn't murdered, okay? Look at me, please, look at me. Your mother wasn't murdered. She wasn't murdered. Okay? She killed herself. She killed herself. Grandpa! Oh my girl! My sweet girl. Here you are. I have something for you. Look at this. Thank you. - What are you doing here? - You found her? You are a liar! You lied to me my whole life! I hate you. I hate you. He's not your grandpa anymore. You can't come here anymore. She's right, Michael. I lied... for all her life. I lied. I instructed the staff to never say any word about what happened here. Understand that I had best of intentions. We all did. Listen, I want to show you something. This is an article from your papers. Carlotta was in one of her states, you know, ranting about some kind of presence coming from Isadora. Just crazy, crazy. After this incident, Carlotta had no recollection of what she had done. Or what she did to our daughter. She forgot her own child, Michael. What could I do? So difficult. Reunite her with Isadora or leave her behind to spend the rest of her life in an institution, or worse? This would send her over the edge. She led a nice life here. She had everything she needs. Nice life. I changed our tickets. We're leaving tomorrow. The Ciardullos' offer... All you have to do is sign. You're just like my father. - Look, we have our own lives to get back to. - What life? Our real life. Our real home. This is my real home. No, this is what matters. This is important. This is what's real. Thank you, Michael. It was great dealing with you. Pleasure. - Take it easy, okay? - We'll see you soon, huh. Absolutely. Keep in touch. Alright. I made a surprise for mommy. It's beautiful. Why don't you surprise her with it? She is coming. It's a beautiful day, huh? It's cold as fuck out. I made a surprise for you, Mommy. Mmm. It's a fairytale. Isadora, you need to get ready. Your wish is my command. Is mommy mad at grandpa? Doesn't she love us anymore? This trip... Well, it's been really, really hard on mommy. We just need to be there for her and let her know how much we love her. Is it 'cause of me? Momma loves you. She loves you. It's... it's my fault. She's mad at me because... I didn't see how sad she was. Everything's going to be all right. Okay? Daddy is here for you. Always. I promise. Love you. Jordan. You okay, baby? Baby, are you okay? Baby, wake up. Honey. Mommy! What're you... what're you doing? Right. And she'll sign and send when we... the final paperwork once we get into New York tomorrow. Okay. What do you see? I see a snake. I saw my mother. You mean you're remembering her? No. I saw my mother here. Isadora, I think this place is no good for you. And I think your father was right to take you away from her. This is where I'm supposed to be. My mother wanted me to find her. Your mother is dead. I'm sorry to say that, but it's the truth. The only thing left for us to do is to close the sale and go home. We can still salvage whatever good can come out of this place. No? Michael. Let's... you close the sale and then we go home. Yes, please. Let's get out of here. Who is this? Your mother. I've never seen this woman before in my life. She killed them all. Who? What are you talking about? It wasn't my mother. Don't you see? It takes a child. It will always take a child. It wants to kill our baby. - Jordan is fine. - No, she's not fine. - Jordan is fine. Yes. - She is in danger. No, she is not in danger. These are your mother's demons, not yours. I remember, my mother, she wanted to protect me. There was someone else. There was nobody else! The two of you were alone. Isadora, your mother tried to stab you. No. No. No. No. Jordy. Where are you? Come on Jordy, no games now. Jordan. It's the carnival. You think she went down there? I don't know. Come on. Jordan. - Jordan. - Jordan. Jordan. Jordan? Michael. It's like my dream, Michael. It's like my dream. Jordan. Jordan. Jordan. Jordan. Jordan. Jordan. What did you do? Why did you leave me? Where did you go? I looked all over for you. Carlo... You! Just trust me baby, okay. No! No! What do you want from me? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Let go of her! Don't leave me! No! No! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! No! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Once today is gone, tomorrow can only look back in sorrow. The warning was ignored. This is what I must say as if you were here, listening. You must understand why... You must never return. I sacrificed myself so you can go on living.
