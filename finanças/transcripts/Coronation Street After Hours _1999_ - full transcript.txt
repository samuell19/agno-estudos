Still no word from the police? I just... I can't shake this feeling that summat terrible's happened. But you don't know that. Yeah, I know what Ray's capable of, and I know he hates my guts. What if this is his sick way of getting pay back? KNOCKING ON THE DOOR It's the police. FRONT DOOR CLOSES Have you found him? Sorry? Kev - is he all right? I'm just here to take a statement about the bribe you witnessed? What's wrong with you people? Don't you talk to each other?! My boyfriend is missing! I'm sorry. I know nothing about that. Well, ask Ray Crosby! He's in custody, isn't he? Ask him what he's done to my Kev! Is it just me... or is the atmosphere a little frosty? SHE LAUGHS Oh, come on, I know you're angry with me, but... can't we just put it on... LAUGHING: ..ice? Put it on ice! I'm going out of my mind here, and all you can do is tell jokes. Well, it beats tearing each other down. Or have you not finished highlighting my many failings? No, don't tell me - cold shoulder. SHE LAUGHS This is just the tip of the iceberg. LAUGHING: Tip of the iceberg! What's the matter with you? Have you not been listening to a word I've said? Oh, get off your high horse. Anyone would think you'd led the perfect life the way you go on at me. Well, let me tell you, you've done a few crappy things in your time, an' all. Well, I didn't go into business with a sex offender or swindle my neighbours out of their homes! But you have cheated on your wife and served time for assault. Oh, and this is my favourite, fathered a love-child with a girl half your age while your wife had breast cancer. Yeah? You see? Two can play at this game. Yeah, well, whatever I've done, I've followed my heart. You only followed the money. And why's that, 'ey? Because you're selfish, and greedy, and it's all you care about. SHOUTS: Because it's all I've got! You think I wanted this life, hey? Do you not think I look at you and wish I had everything that you have? Yeah, of course I love the money and the success, but guess what? Never loves me back. MAN ON TV: 'Cyprus is an island in which sea?' LEANNE GROANS SHE SIGHS How long have I been asleep for? Si, do you fancy a brew? We're out of teabags. Oh. Right, well, it's OK. I've not chucked this lot, so I can squeeze a cup out of it. So that's what we've come to now, is it? Double-dipping teabags? Si, it'll get better. Not while you're making premium-rate calls to a telephone psychic, though. How dare you log into my account! Well, who do you think's gonna pay the bill, 'ey? The money fairy?! Actually, no, don't answer that. You must be living in cloud-cuckoo-land if you think these psychics are actually speaking to Oliver! Well, I don't care what you think. I know they are. And if you don't like it, you know where the door is! What's up? I've got news... about the pews. Do I have to respond in rhyme? HE LAUGHS No, the, erm... the Church Council went for it. So, erm, we're on. Great, well, I've already lined up a buyer. He's offering six grand for the lot. Â£6,000? Aw, that's so much more than I thought. What's he gonna do with them all? Just strip them down and sell them on as garden benches. Oh. So, people can enjoy the view... from their pew! I'll keep you posted. Yeah, do! RINGING TONE Hey. Just the man! I've spoken to the Archdeacon, and he won't accept a penny less than seven and a half. 'Ey, come on, pal. It's a steal. Oh... why aren't they telling us anything? It's been over two hours now. Now, there's no point in getting into a flap until there's something to flap about. Oh, how can you be so calm?! Don't you even understand how serious this is?! Yes! As a matter of fact, I do understand! I do not choose to pace up and down and pester the doctors all the time, but it doesn't mean that I'm not incredibly frightened. You're not the only one who stands to lose somebody that they love. Yeah. I'm sorry. DOOR OPENS EVELYN GASPS FIZ GASPS Oh, thank the Lord! Are you OK? What happened? We've been worried sick! Was it your heart? What are you doing up? All right, let the boy get a word in! Look, I'm fine. It wasn't my heart. It was a reflux thingy. I can't remember the name of it. Heartburn, was it? Because I could've saved us all a trip to hospital if it was. I always carry Rennies in my handbag. It was more serious than that. I've never felt pain like it. And I know - I've never experienced childbirth. Oh, you big dafty. We thought we were gonna lose you. You can see why she's worried. Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Kevin's left her, and I can't say I blame him. You must've noticed, she's got some mouth on her. Hm! My bet is, he's in cahoots with that sister of his, and they've both done a runner with my money! And don't you think he'd have brought his son with him if that were the case? Yeah, well... maybe he didn't get chance, or maybe Debbie wouldn't let him. I mean, she doesn't exactly strike me as the nurturing type. So, you're telling me you've absolutely no idea where either of them could be? Not a clue. But if I were to guess, I'd say they'll be sipping rum and cokes on some beach somewhere, soaking up some sun. SHE BREATHES DEEPLY Do you remember when Mum died? Course I do. I don't know how it happened, but I sort of slipped into her shoes. I thought it was my responsibility to look after you and Dad. So, I made the teas, cleaned up after you both. EXHALES SLOWLY Sorted out all the laundry. I was just a kid. I should've been out with my mates, partying, getting drunk, trying my first joint. SHE SIGHS Falling in love. Hm! But instead I was at home... scrubbing your dirty undies. SHE BREATHES DEEPLY And I'm not blaming anyone. I was a very... willing doormat. SHE SIGHS Just like Mum. But I remember thinking... .."when I'm old enough to leave home... "I'll never ever be anybody's doormat again." SHE PANTS "I'm gonna make something of myself." Well, you did. Me and Dad were so proud of you. Trouble is... ..no amount of money can make up for being on your own. Oh... And when I finally realised that... ..it was too late. HER BREATH TREMBLES What I wouldn't give, 'ey? To be washing dirty undies again. VOICE SHAKING: You... are not alone, Debs. SHE GASPS Oh, I am. There's... there's people out there worried sick about where you are now. Abi... Jack... the girls, all your mates. SHE LAUGHS Even Sally, I shouldn't wonder. SHE PANTS Well, there's not one single person who'll notice I've gone. HER BREATH SHAKES, HE PUFFS He's lying! Are Kevin and his sister close? Well, yeah, quite, but run off together? That's insane! Well, Ray said that Debbie's cleared him out. Took him for thousands. Do you think Kevin might have fancied a piece of the pie? Are you...? You've got this all wrong! Ray has got you wrapped round his little finger, hasn't he? I'm only trying to establish the facts. Well, here's one for you - Kevin would never leave Jack. Are you sure he hasn't been in contact? No. Jack's at his mate's house. He doesn't even know his dad's missing yet. I mean, what am I supposed to tell him? Well, tell him that if he is in contact, he's to phone the police. Meanwhile, we'll get the Missing Persons team to put an alert out at all ports and airports. And what good is that gonna do? The only reason Kevin hasn't been in touch is because he can't! He's hurt, or he's... SHE SNIFFLES You know, we're just wasting time here. If your lot won't find him, I'll find him myself! FIZ SIGHS Reflux eso-pha-gitis. Blimey, it's a mouthful, in't it? But it does say here it's really easily treated with them pills they've given him. Yeah, in conjunction with a healthier lifestyle. That's what the doctor said. So, no more of that junk food you feed him. You can talk! You're always slipping him an extra portion of pudding! He gets one of his five-a-day in my apple crumble. It doesn't count when it's stewed in half a bag of sugar. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT, NAIL FILE SCRAPING Oh, we were just discussing your change of diet, lad. Out with the cream cakes, in with the curly kale. And a spot of exercise won't harm. You know, you need to tone yourself up a bit. He doesn't need to tone up. He's gorgeous just the way he is. Well, doctor's orders, innit? We don't want another repeat of today. No, we don't. Oof! What a carry on! EVELYN SIGHS Right. I'd best take Cerberus for his walk. Oh, heck. I can't... I can't move my legs! You what? I can't move me... LEGS THUMPING Oh, yes, I can. CLEARS HER THROAT Just... just pins and needles. Come on, Cerberus. Never gonna live this down, am I? Take no notice her. DOOR CLOSES And don't let her get you all paranoid about your health either. I like a bit of meat on my man! Oh... Oh, it's sexy! Oh, I'm really pleased, love. What, that I'm not going mad? No, that your hallucinations will stop once your eyesight improves. You don't seem very happy. HE SIGHS Truth is... I like having him around. HE SIGHS I know it's stupid, isn't it? HE SIGHS Maybe I am losing the plot. Hey, it's perfectly natural to want to feel close to Aidan, but... ..you need to focus on getting better. Not chasing ghosts. If I could see his face... just once... ..maybe I can say goodbye. Properly. But you can see his face anytime you like! When I want to see Tom, I just... I close my eyes and there he is. Singing... SHE LAUGHS ..too loudly in his pre-school nativity, or... or giggling away when I gave him a bubble beard in the bath. You must have memories like that you can draw on. Course I do. But they've faded over time. It's like watching an old cine reel. When I see him now, it's in full technicolour. Like if he was turn around, he'd be as real as you are now. Oh... But you're right. It won't do me any good in the long term. It's got to stop. VOICE SHAKING: I didn't realise you were so unhappy. Huh. QUIETLY: Why would you? 'Ey? SHE SIGHS, HE EXHALES I do a very convincing impression of being a cold-hearted bitch. SHE PANTS Besides, it's... It's enough to know that you are... happy. Finally. I know I give Abi a really hard time, but... ..she's the best thing that's ever happened to you, Kev. Never let her go. HE PANTS I have to pinch myself. HIS BREATHING QUIVERS I think I don't deserve her. Hey! You've found a penny... SHE EXHALES ..but she's found a pound. And don't you ever forget that. You're right. You always did look out for me. You still do. And I'm the older brother. It's supposed to be the other way round. Remember that time I came home from school with no trainers? Before... before we moved here. HE GASPS I got jumped by some lads from school. Y-y-y-you walked three miles in your bare feet... just to get home. I thought I'd get some sympathy. Dad went nuts. He... He said I should've put up a fight. And I'd better grow up quick, cos... HE GASPS ..the doctor's just told him Mum might not survive the night. He blurted it out... just like that. That was just... just Dad's way. I couldn't sleep that night... ..thinking if I closed my eyes... HE BREATHES RAPIDLY ..she might not be alive when I wake up. And... HE BREATHES RAPIDLY ..you said y-y-you'd stay up with me. Did I? You... You sang Abba songs... ..to keep us awake. Over and over, like a broke record. BOTH LAUGH I'm sorry... ..I've not been a better brother to you. HE BREATHES RAPIDLY Hey... Hey, no. You... SHE PANTS You don't have to be sorry. Was... It's me... it's me that should be sorry... ..for getting you involved in all of this mess! SHE GASPS I wish there was a... there was a way I could make it up to you, Kev. HE GASPS QUIETLY: ..but I don't think I'm getting out of here. HE WHIMPERS AND BREATHES RAPIDLY Don't even talk like that. I'm so cold. I'm so cold, it... it hurts. And I'm tired. Are you tired? I am so tired. BOTH GASP You... ..are not gonna die! HIS BREATH QUIVERS I'm... I'm not... I'm not gonna let you die! HE BREATHES DEEPLY Help! THUD Help! Please! I found her laptop, but I can't get in it. SHE SIGHS This is hopeless. I don't even know what I'm looking for. SEB: 'Receipts, travel documents...' THUDDING Shut up a minute. I can hear summat. THUDDING CONTINUES Seb, I'll call you back. PHONE BEEPS THUDDING CONTINUES Please stop. THUD It's... It's no use. Someone... must be able to hear us! No... SHOUTS: Help! No... I don't... I don't feel so... DROPS BAR Debbie? Debbie! Stay with me! Stay with me, please! HE EXHALES Hello? PHONE RINGS Hiya. SEB: 'So what was it? The noise?' Oh, dunno. It must've come from outside. It's stopped now. I think I've found summat, though. 'What?' I'm not sure. I'm coming home. PHONE BEEPS I got those herbal ones you like. Oh, the ones that taste like dishwater? Well, they do. Look, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. Aw, I'm sorry too, Si. I'm really sorry. I hadn't realised how much I'd spent. If you want me to stop, I will. No, no. Of course I don't want you to do that. Not if it makes you happy. Look, I just... I want to understand. Do you really think these psychics are speaking to Oliver? Look, I know it sounds mad, but, yeah, I do. When I speak to her, I mean... She knows things that she couldn't possibly have know. Like... like that Oliver used to fall asleep listening to his music box, and that he had dinosaurs on his pyjamas. Do you not think that they could just be lucky guesses? We... Well, yeah, I suppose you could argue that, but... ..when I speak to her, it's like... It's like he's in the room with me. Just like you are now. And... 'Well, it's the closest I get to holding him in my arms again. 'And I know my boy's gone. 'And I'm never gonna him back. 'Not really. 'But it's that overwhelming feeling of love and closeness. 'And I'm not ready to give up on that.' CLANGING 'Not yet.' TOILET FLUSHES HE BREATHES DEEPLY It's my turn... ..to look after you now, sis. HE GASPS I won't let you down.
