Frankenstein! Bring him down to the village. Let's take him home. I thought I knew all about monsters. I used to watch them late at night on Dad's TV show. After we moved to Oakland, he stopped doing kids' shows because he was different now. Everything was different. Now he was Al Gory, monster of ceremonies on Midnight Shriek. - Al - What? Oh, it's you again. So, anyway, before we dig into our second feature, I have to pay a visit to my ageing mother. She would've wanted me to have this. It was on real late, way past my bedtime. Dad didn't let me stay up to see it, so I used to wait for Mrs Sampson to fall asleep... - Hold it. I think that was a good one. - ...and sneak into his bedroom to watch. But then I'd get scared alone in his room at night, and I wouldn't know why. I didn't know yet what I was going to learn that year... That monsters are real. We had sort of just picked up and left Syracuse, crossing the country, finding a house, the three of us taking care of the grown-up stuff together. Who is it? - I got that. I got that. - Come on, Dylan. I guess it could've been strange, being in a new place... Can your dad come out and play? ...but it didn't take long for Dad to become a celebrity among the kids on our block. When's the monster coming out? There's no such thing as monsters. You all know that, don't you? Monsters exist only in ourselves. They live in the darkest chambers of our hearts. They never actually come out into the world, unless a metal light appears in the sky, but when did you last see that? So why don't we try and be adults about this and run along home, OK? - Hey, what's that? - Mr Leary. - What? - Look! Look! Look. There it is. Oh, no! He's doing it again! He was always a madman for playing with kids. Mom used to say that was because he was really just a kid himself. Mr Leary, what's that strange power you have over our children? I'm the perfect monster. The house in Oakland was perfect for playing anything, especially the flashlight game. Come on, Dylan. In the closet. But it was different now, the way he played with us. It was like he had to do it. After the heartbreak, sometimes I wondered if Dad didn't need our games more than we did. OK, right. That's right. Now let's go over your bass note, OK? Ready? Jack the Bear Where's C? Right. Great. Great. Now again. Sorry, Mom. Right. Very, very nice, Jack. Hey, Jackie Bear. Hey. Mom? Mom died last winter. Dylan, don't wake Dad. We were still learning the things you need to know when you move to a new house, like, in our case, don't play in the backyard. If you get caught in there, they eat you. Out front, there was a whole neighbourhood to get to know. OK? We'll put the ball right there, OK? Like Mr Festinger, who always yelled at his son Edward for being retarded. Edward! What did I tell you about your eyes and the ball? - You never take your eyes off the ball! - All right. You almost caught that one. And Dexter, who lived next door. My mom might be sleeping. His parents were his grandparents. His real parents had split from each other, and from him, and probably from everything. Guess what? We got company. Let's go to my room. Of course, his grandparents weren't doing much better. Did I tell you he was a fighting Seabee? No one else on our street would let their kids play at the Mitchells'. - Come on, Mitchell. - That's them over there. Go get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em! Hey, zombie! That's right. I'm talking to you. The next time your dog defecates on my lawn, he's dead, pal. Goddamn zombie. And then there was Norman the zombie, who mangled his leg in a terrible accident as a teenager, when he crashed his T-Bird into an ice-cream truck. He'd fixed up the car and kept it on blocks in his driveway, washing it every day. You know, inside that cane is a sword. I've seen it. He attacked Mr Festinger one night with a tree branch. - Hit him right over the head with it. - Also blinded his own dog with a rock. You ever look at it? Looks like a dead marble. He's coming for us. - Get down! Get down! Dig! Dig! Dig! - Oh, my God. Dig, he's coming! Is Norman gonna get us? He's not gonna get us. He killed his parents. - You seen 'em over there in a long time? - I've never seen them. You used to, walking around behind the curtains. - I'm not gonna go over, that's for sure. - Maybe we should. - I'll get it. - No, I wanna do it myself. - Well, don't fall. - OK, kids. - Get to bed. - I can reach it. Don't give Mrs Sampson a heart attack. What's up, Jackie Bear? Nothing. We're gonna have a lot of fun at the studio tomorrow, but as for now, it's off to work. Buying a new car doesn't have to give you a headache, not if you go to East Bay Dodge. Ah, my old friend Psycho Ward Cleaver. Put that thing down, Psycho. We'll go for a test drive. You know, Psycho, this beautiful Dodge Challenger is loaded. Air conditioning, power steering, blood bucket seats... Michael, wait up. Michael! Go on. Go on. - What do we do now? - Let's go. - You got it? - Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing? Mike, what are you doing? - Norman is gonna kill you guys. - We'll spray anyway. Jackie, wake up. We gotta go downstairs. He said he'd cut his foot investigating a noise outside his house. I couldn't figure out why he didn't tell Dad the rest. He must not have too many good friends if he had to come to us in his time of need. He has a sword in that cane. Really? Yeah. And he attacked Mr Festinger one night with a tree branch. Really? I wonder why he didn't use the sword. I guess that's when it started. I just didn't realise till later that the trouble wasn't only with Norman. Me spill. Who let this brat into my crypt? Spaghetti Bolognese? Now, how do you expect me to clean up this mess? This oughta do the trick. - Don't move, Dylan. Hang in there. - Cut camera one. Lock it off. - All right. You can move now. Peggy? - Come here. - Take his clothes off. Here you go. - Hi, Peggy. One day you'll like the girls doing this. Jack, don't you wanna be in it? - No way. I have friends who watch this show. - Give me the clothes. Put 'em right here. John, can I see you for a second? - Now, Gordon? - Right now. Do you mind? All right. Well, let's take five. What? What, are you cancelling the show? No, no. I love this show. I love you. I love everything. - You're gonna give me more bread? - I fought hard for you. They're pinning me to the mat. They have a problem with Psycho Ward Cleaver. - They think he's in bad taste. - Because he has multiple head wounds? Who knows? So just think of another character. Is this a suggestion or a non-negotiable demand? It's a... It's just a... it's just a phone call. They make a phone call and you roll over. Don't worry. Your dad can always calm Gordon down. You're laying down on it. These people say "Shit" and you say, "What colour?‚Äù All right. Give me the jug. Peggy, see if you can round up a bucket of dog vomit. We'll throw it on the rug. All right, come on. Mom said Dad bristled when he got mad. Some people made him madder than others. Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Hi. Oh, look at him. Maybe that's where the trouble came from. - Look who's here. - Oh, my goodness. Hi. How are you, son? Hi, John. - Whoa! Look at that, Dylan. - Hey. For you. Long ago in Hollywood, Mom's parents were put on a blacklist for Communists, though no one ever proved they carried the cards, which is the way you could tell. - Lincoln Steffens. Thank you, Grandma. - He's a great man, Jack. Someone stays with you and your brother while Dad's at work? - Mrs Sampson. - An older woman? I knew he was trying to get me to rat on Dad the way his friends ratted on him long ago, fishing for something he could hold against Dad to his grave. Is he laying off the sauce? You know, it doesn't help make things better, John, only worse. Couldn't resist, could you, Sid? - Didn't help your marriage much. - Sidney. - Is this why you came? - I came to see my grandchildren. Then what are you doing talking to me? Listen. You leave the children with strangers, or what's even worse, on their own. I pay a responsible woman to look after them. What the hell else should I do? Don't use that tone to talk about your own children's welfare. - We all want the same thing. - I won't discuss this. Fine. Keep drinking. Lose this job like the others. We'll go to court and take those kids. I'll tell you what, Sid. Over my dead body. How's that? That's when you can have my boys. They left that night. Dad. Aren't you gonna take Dylan to school? It's Dylan's first day. Dylan, let's go! - What are you doing? - My shoes. Dylan. Dylan. Do you want the dogs? - I want Daddy. - Daddy's asleep. I want Daddy to take me to school. Daddy! Daddy! I want Daddy. Where's Mommy? Where's Mommy? Listen, Dylan. - You have to go in there. OK? They'll be nice. - No. You have to. You have to go. OK? Come on. I'll pick you up later. Now, go. You have to go. Go! Japanese poetry is a drama. It's about life and death. It's... Sorry I'm late. I had to... It's OK. Have a seat. That's right. No desks. Join us. - You have a desk. - Table. - Wanna sit at it? - No, sir. No "sir", either. The name's Vince. Hi, Jack. I know about your mom. So, we have a lot of things for each of you to try. Besides the electrical experiments and herb garden, there's a "Learning to Communicate Your Feelings" workshop, which I'll teach. Oh, Jesus. - Can I help you? - Yeah... Actually, I was supposed to drop off my son today. I was detained, and I just came by to see if he was OK. - How old is he? - He's three. It's his first day. If he's all right, maybe you should let him be. It might be harder if he sees you. He's a good kid. I'm gonna go. - Is there afire? - No. Man, it's that lady in there. The kid came home and found her. She's barely alive. There must be a square yard of pill bottles. - Dexter, is your mom sick? - No. She's just not moving. I knew right away when I saw Dexter coming home from school with his lunch pail. He looked like an angel, or a girl, his face all soft and rosy and sweet. My mom's dead. Did you hear about Dexter's mom? Yeah. Dylan! Dylan, no! You wearing those to school or what? The weeks went by and fall came, with cold mornings like in Syracuse. Things had started to change. There was even a girl at school who started talking to me. Hi, Jack. Hi, Karen. She was what my dad called a long drink of water. I wanted to tell you that I liked what you wrote for the poets' corner. I thought it showed great sensitivity. - It did? - Yeah. Thanks. I figured I was lame. I knew there was something I should do about the situation, and for the life of me, I didn't know what it was. Would you like to come to my house for some goulash Friday night? At about 6:30pm? Sure. Great. - Yes! She said yes. - All right. - I told her goulash. - Great. I'll make my famous goulash. - Really? - Maybe I should invite somebody so it's not just her and three men. What do you think? - Who? - I don't know. Maybe Peggy. I know it was stupid, but I found myself wishing Mom could fly back into the world. - It's up to you. Whatever you want. - Yeah. No, that'd be great. Great. - Should I button it? - We're casual, right? - I shouldn't button it? - It looks good. You need a sweater. - I don't have any sweaters! What time is it? - You got plenty. - Dad, I have to leave. - Relax. Try on a sweater. Nothing goes! This goes. - I have to get outta here. I'll take this. - It's clear. It doesn't clash. I'm going, OK? Goodbye. Don't you want me to iron that for you? Aren't you interested in what I'm gonna wear? What am I gonna wear? - Would you like a V8 juice? - V8 juice? Sure. You must be Jack. You must be Mrs Morris. - Karen should be right down. - OK. I was afraid they were gonna ask about my family, and I'd have to tell them about Mom. Here you go, Jack. Thank you. And then they'd have to say, "We're sorry to hear about that,‚Äù and then I'd have to say, "Well, that's all right. You didn't know.‚Äù And then there'd be that awful silence where there would be nothing else to say. - So, Jack. Tell us about your... - Hi, Jack. - What happened here? - Nobody knows. They just showed up. Hi, Dad. This is Karen. - Hello. How are you? - Hi, Mr Leary. It's very nice to meet you, Karen. Peggy Etinger, this is my son Jack Leary and his friend Karen Morris. Karen Morris, this is my friend Peggy Etinger and my son Dylan Leary. Dylan, this is Karen, and your brother who you know. Jack, this is your brother Dylan, who you know, and my friend Peggy. Does anybody know who's playing in there? That's Glenn Miller. OK. It's time you kids learned classical music. Very nice. - Thank you, Peggy. - You're welcome. At last, the goulash you've all been waiting for. - I want my goulash! - I'll do it, thank you. - You may have your goulash. - All right. You do the goulash, I do the wine. - Yes, here it is. - Great year for Welch's. - Tasty goulash. Eat that all up. Excuse me. - For you. - Mr Leary. - Excuse me. Pardon me. - Jack tells me you used to have a kids' show. - He told you that, eh? Thank you very much. - Miss Etinger, a little goulash? - Come on, Dad. All right. You broke my arm. Hi, boys and girls. Are you here for Kid Stuff? Well, hold your horses and tie up your dragonflies, because today, we're gonna talk about... colours! - Red, green, blue, orange, chartreuse! - Dad was really on. Goulash, John? Don't mind if I do-lash. - Heart. - All right. Don't call clubs. Don't call clubs. Don't call clubs. Karen, look into my eyes. Look at me. Don't call clubs. Don't call clubs. Don't call clubs. - Clubs. - Don't call clubs, clubs, clubs. Oh, clubs. Oh, no, clubs. She called clubs. No clubs. That ain't a club. He was like an artist, only what he was creating was the perfect evening... - She called clubs. - ...and it was all for Karen and me. - In the closet. There's a secret passageway. - Coming! Where are you? - Quick. Come on. Let's go. - Here I come. Where are you? Are you in here? No. Back off. Up the stairs we come. Someday, if I ever get that far, maybe I'll be able to do the same thing for my son. Where are those kids? - Great meeting you. I'm glad you came. - It's nice meeting you, too. - Nice to meet you. Bye. Thank you. - OK, see you later, Peggy. It was good. - Good night, Dad. - Good night. You want me to drive you? No. Good night. Good night, Dad. I was being sincere. It really was a lovely evening. I hope there'll be more. Do you wanna come in? Well... good night. Good night. I don't know what it was. Maybe the rain. But after that night, everything just started falling into place. The Oakland A's made it to the Series and we sat glued to the set for all seven games. - Two down. - Two down. OK. - Oh, no, it's Pete Rose, Dad. - No sweat. - And on that last fly ball... - Come on, come on! ...we were on our feet, because we were champs. Oh, yes! Yes! A's! A's! A's! A's! A's! A's! See, Jack? We bring luck wherever we go. A's! A's! A's! A's! A's! Whoa, cookie monster. Whoa, cookie monster. One bag cookies. One bag. One bag. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. My tongue grows. So from time to time... I have to nip a little off like this. There. That's much better, don't you think? Hey, Dexter. You like television? Dad always went all out for Halloween. But later that night, he went too far. Open the door. What are you trying to tell me? You're too old to run around in a costume? How do you think that makes me feel? So don't wear one, then. No one's making you. - I like wearing one. - Well, good. Jackie, come on. It's Halloween. You can wear a costume and still be dignified. Look at me. - Trick or treat? - Twick or tweat? All right, Mr Adult. The candy cauldron is right here by the door. If you run out, there's more in the cupboard by the fridge, or there's the change jar. OK, Charles, let's go and leave your brother to reflect on his lost childhood. Here you go. Hold that bag. Come on, now. Do that walk. - My little brother's a clown. - Where is he? He's with my mom. Hi, Jack. Trick or treat? Hi, Katie. Hello, Edward. We saw your dad down the street. He's dressed like a big rabbit. - I know. - Well, bye. Hi, Mike. - You recognised me? - Sure. Man, you're full of it. You recognised me. Bye, Michael. - OK, OK, wait. What are you supposed to be? - Me. - You? - Myself. You're getting strange, man. - Hello? - Hello, sir. It's Jack Leary. Is Karen there? - No. She went to the party with her friends. - What party? The big Halloween party. - You want me to tell her you called? - No, that's OK. Thank you. Trick or treat, Jack? Trick or treat, Jack? Dexter, where'd you get the...? Thanks. How'd I do? Wow. Huh? Not bad, considering I had to lug your brother halfway around the neighbourhood. - Where would Dexter get a Nazi uniform? - Norman gave it to him. - He probably was dressed as a bus driver. - Yeah, but, Dad, he went like this. - Don't do that in this house. - What are we gonna do about it? - That's Mrs Sampson. - Dad... How you doing, Norman? What, are you out trick-or-treating? No. I'm taking this opportunity to collect contributions for State Assembly candidate Elder Mcintyre. Mr McIntyre is a former law enforcement officer. I know who he is. Because... - I grew up on this street. - Excuse me? When I was a kid, you didn't see them around. They kept their distance. -"They"? - The niggers and the Jews. Oh. They. Mr McIntyre can help us. But he needs our help. Anything you could spare would be greatly appreciated. Halloween is my favourite holiday. I love seeing their costumes. - What did you go as? - A bunny. Well, all right. Excuse me, sir. - Mrs Sampson. - Hi, Jack. Hi, Mrs Sampson. As one white man to another... I moved across the street from a goddamn Nazi. Oh, my God. "Niggers and Jews." Excuse me, Mrs Sampson. - You're not Jewish, are you? - No, I'm a Jehovah's Witness. - Sorry about this, Mrs Sampson. - Don't worry about it, honey. Nothing you can do about it. Elder McIntyre. Dad showed Invasion of the Body Snatchers that night - his favourite movie. He said it was about the stupid people who worried that Communists would take over the country. ...and all the towns around us. It's a malignant disease spreading through the whole country. I don't wanna alarm you, but check out what this movie is really about. Pods from outer space? Some small town called Santa Rita? This is your town. He was drunk, not pretending. I could tell by his half-closed eyes and the slow way he moved. Look again at that man across the street watering his lawn. - Go to two. - Two's off the set. Or that woman climbing out of her Pontiac... carrying her grocery bags. - How big is that nose? - Dad, don't do this. Who are these people moving in? Niggers? Jews? - Commie bastards? - Shit. You turn around, and one day there they are. If you don't wanna think about it, don't. But if you're smart... Oh, my God. ...you'll join me and candidate... for Assembly Elder McIntyre. - Cut him off. Cut him off now! - Anything you can spare is appreciated. Thank you for your kind attention, and Sieg heil. Get ready to get them out. He was really big up close. I knew it was wrong, but I thought of dragging him over onto Festinger's lawn. I figured I'd leave a trail, or someone coming out of their house'd look over and see me. If I could do it all over again, I would've rolled him there if I had to. Absolutely. Dad! Oh, man, what's that? Dad. Martini like Daddy. The vet said poison, and we were the prime suspects. No matter where Cheyenne was poisoned, stumbling around coughing his guts out, it was our front yard he finally crashed on. - What the heck do you want me to do? - Tell him we didn't do it! - He doesn't think we did it. - Dad, after last night... Norman, hi. I came over here to apologise to you. I did a very mean-spirited thing on my show last night. I don't know if you saw it. I was drunk. - I know that's no excuse. - I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't kill your dog, Norman. I'm sorry that somebody did. I didn't poison your dog, Norman. If you knew me better, you'd know it's not my style. I'd have shot him. For those of you whose brains aren't withered, here's a startling demonstration. My old friend Psycho Ward Cleaver will do the honours. Take 'em away, Psycho. - Not enough blood. - Hey, I found The Beast with a Million Eyes. We'll put it on Friday night with Mr Sardonicus. - OK. - John. John! I think you need some time off. - What? - You need a break. Last night was too much, John. - Do I get to decide how long a break I need? - No. So you're firing me? Is that what you're saying? You're firing me? - Don't press it, John. - I wanna press it. I think I should press it. I'll take a week off. Who turned your motor on? Look, Jack. I think it would be best if we began seeing other people. I mean, we can still be friends. I'm just too young to tie myself to one guy, Jack. Where did you hear this? On television? It's just the way I feel. I didn't know why Dad stopped going to work. I asked him if he was looking for a new job. He wouldn't even talk about it. It wasn't like he had changed in any way. I don't know. Maybe we were just growing apart. - So, what's the story? - No story. Did you see any other fathers acting like seals? - Somebody had to do it. - Could you ever just stop for one minute? I need to know if you plan on being Bozo the Clown your whole life. Listen to this. Who's the father and who's the son here? I don't know. Open the goddamn door, Dylan. - It's locked. - I know it is. You locked it. Now unlock it. - I don't know how. - Then turn off the goddamn water. - I don't know how. - Turn those goddamn knobs. - I don't know how. - Goddammit! Goddammit! - I said come on! - No! No! No, Jack, no! No! No, Jack! Please, no! Now, you stay there! Stay there! Jack! Jack! Thank you, Jack. I was beginning to wonder if the awful reprisals we expected from Norman weren't coming instead from ourselves, from the darkest chambers, as Dad said, of our hearts. I'll pay you a nickel to watch my brother for a while. ...then he vanished like the snows of yesteryear, possibly never to return. Jack the Bear, he don't care Takes those steps and gets nowhere Jack the Bear Jack the Bear, yes, he is - Surprise! - Happy birthday! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jackie, what's the matter? - They all saw me singing. - So? - Well, they're laughing about it. - Oh, no, they aren't. They're laughing because they're at a party. They're happy. Jackie Bear... Don't touch me. Get outta my room. Get outta my room now. Get out! - Where's Dylan? - He's gone. Where? - Where? - There. In the street. My brother doesn't go in the street. Look, man. My brother is my responsibility. Now, where the hell is he? Does this mean I don't get to keep the nickel? Do you wanna die? Talk! Talk! Talk! Norman. Norman what? Norman what? Come on, tell me now! - He took him in a car. - Norman's car's right there, idiot. It doesn't even have a motor. Hey! - What car? - Another car. A white car. - You were supposed to watch him! - He's your brother. Get off me. I'll get off you if you swear that you won't run away. I'll kill you if you run away! I swear. Hey! Where's my brother? I need the police. It's an emergency. I need them to come to my house right now. It was like a dream where your legs keep moving, but you can't get anywhere. I knew I should be finding him, but I didn't know where, or who to ask, or what to do. - What's the trouble, Jack? - Norman kidnapped my brother. Dexter saw it. He wouldn't tell me what happened. What? Hey, Dexter. Get over here. Here. Get over here. Tell me, boy, or I'll wale you. - What the hell are you doing? - None of your business. Shut up. Don't tell me to shut up. I'll put your head through the window of that ugly camper. - It's none of your business. - Why did you hit the kid? You got your nose in everybody's business. - What the hell's going on here? - Leave the kid alone. My brother was kidnapped. I was in the house. He was supposed to be watching him. - Tell him what you saw. - Norman Strick kidnapped him. - There's the father. - In a white car. Sir, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but we believe one of your sons has been kidnapped. - Norman Strick took Dylan away. - Dexter, tell 'em. We need some information from you so we can start the search... Sir? - Who is this man who took him away? - His name is Norman Strick. How are you doing, son? It was getting to be his bedtime. All I could think was Norman was gonna pull up any second with Dylan, just pull up outside with an ice cream cone. No! Mr Festinger thought he'd died and gone to heaven. He threatened me once, with a tree branch. The man belongs in an institution. I think he's a Nazi. He was the real poisoner of Cheyenne. Why didn't Norman steal Edward? Ten seconds, John. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. John, you're on. Yesterday, at 5pm... my son... was taken by this man. His name is Norman Strick. He's in his late 20s. Walks with a cane. He was... He took him in a white car. My name is Detective John Marker with the Oakland police department. We're asking your help in locating this missing child. His name is Dylan Leary. He's three and a half years old. Dad? We're at a crossroads. Can you feel it? It's dark down there... and there are things nobody wants to meet in the dark. Whether we'll come out on the other side... hating everything and everybody... I don't know. - It's the same argument over again! - I'm raising three children, not two. Oh, I'm a child, is that it? I don't provide for this family? I don't bring my money home? I don't give you a good life? What are you talking about? - I can't take it. I can't take it. - You can't take it any more? Then get out! Hello. Yes, this is Mr Leary. An accident? Is she OK? Where is she? Is she OK? Tell me if she's OK. Is she OK? Tell me if my wife is OK! Is she OK? Is she OK? Jack! Jack! They found Dylan. He's alive. Excuse me! I'm looking for my son. He was lost. He was found. He's small. He's down that way to your right, Mr Leary. Buddy. Hi, buddy. Are we allowed to kiss him? Yeah. Kiss him. They found him in the woods by the reservoir. Not molested, the doctor said, just abandoned. Left to die in the mud by a creek. I myself would have died of terror, alone in the woods, in the night, in the rain, with monsters all around. Norman had disappeared off the face of the earth, and Dylan had stopped talking, from the trauma, they said. After three days and still no words, the doctors decided maybe he should come home, where familiar objects might give him security. - Hi. - Hey, partner. Oh, look at that. Here I am. Where cookies? Who's that? Is that Big Bird? No. Who's that? Is that Cookie Monster? Me want cookie. Is that Cookie? Huh, Dylan? And now observe as I... I don't wanna call you Vince! I feel like you're a teacher if I call you Mr Buccini! - You've every right to be upset. - Then please leave me alone! And stop persecuting me! I couldn't get back into the whole school thing. The place is a mental institution. What I didn't understand is how could a person like me, who'd always been loved, hate so much? John. - I'm so sorry, John. - Yeah. How are you? Are you OK? How's the baby? Hello, sweetheart. Do you remember Grandma? We've been sleeping together in here. It broke. That oughta do it. Goddammit! Goddammit! Dylan, I'm not mad at you, honey. I'm mad at the bed. - Don't make him afraid of his bed. - Shut up! Dylan. Come to Daddy. John! John. Come on. That isn't gonna solve anything. Where is he? Where is your son? - Where is he? - For God's sake! They're responsible! They raised him! They're guilty! Go outta here. He's gone away. He's gone somewhere else. Jackie. My heart's beginning to beat with the monster's heart. Everything in LA was big and bright, except their house. It was small and dark, and Grandpa smelled like it. Or it smelled like him. - Now, tell me why you did that. - To get away from your bishop. Ah, but look. You have to be on your guard every minute, Jack. The other guy always has a trick up his sleeve. Checkmate. Tell me why you did that. You don't know why? You just moved without thinking? Maybe you should let me win once. Let you win? Why? What would that accomplish? I don't know. I'll teach you to win, Jack. I won't let you win. That would be wrong. You'd regret that later on. Now, what you moved into is called the Devil's Crossroads. - I take this piece and you're blocked here. - Dad would let me win. I'm sure he would. You know, he wouldn't be obvious about it, but I'd probably know he was doing it. He'd make a big deal out of it. He'd protest the game. He'd yell and moan about it. He'd tell everyone he was robbed and demand a rematch. It would go on for days. Then I'd like to play chess and I would have learned the Devil's Crossroads. Because of him. I'm sorry, Elizabeth. Tell me what I gotta do, Gordon. Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. You wanna change the show? We'll change it. We'll make it a kiddie show. - We'll make it light and bright... Why not? - No. No. No! - A talk show. Cartoons. A cooking show. - No. John, no. No! - Why not? - Because I don't trust you. - You have to trust me! - Why? Because I can't lose my kids. Can he pick up the ticket at the airport? Yes, he's flown before. That's right. L-E-A-R-Y. One way. Dylan, I'm going to Dad. I'm gonna get him, and we're gonna come back for you, OK? You'll be OK here while I'm gone. - Thanks. - No problem. Dad! Shit. Dad? Jack, are you in there? Jackie? Jackie? Jack, you in there? Home run, Jack. Jack... I just wanna talk to you. Help! Somebody help! Where are you going, Jack? I just wanna talk to you. Don't you wanna talk to me? Get the fuck away from him now! You touch my son and I'll kill you, you hear me? Dad! Daddy! Jackie! Jack! Jackie. Why am I doing this? I kept wondering what Mom would say if she saw Dad cleaning up the house, trying to make things great for Dylan's homecoming. But I didn't have much faith in what he could do any more. And now we return to those kings of horror, Abbott and Costello. Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Chick! Even though he was doing better, it's just that I knew now there was more than one kind of monster in the world. - Hi, Mr Leary. - Hi. When's the monster coming out? There's no such thing as monsters. You all know that. We know. They're only in our hearts. - They don't come out into the world. - Unless there's a metal light in the sky. No, not even then. We'll think of a new game, OK? "Once there was a little bunny who wanted to run away.‚Äù "So he said to his mother, 'I am running away.'" "'If you run away,' said his mother, I will run after you...'" "'...for you are my little bunny.'" "'If you run after me,' said the little bunny, 'I will become a rock on the mountain, high above you.'" "'If you become a rock on the mountain,' said his mother, 'I'll become a mountain climber and climb to where you are.'" "'If you become a mountain climber and climb to me,' said the little bunny, 'I will be a bird, and fly away from you.'" "'If you become a bird and fly away from me,' said his mother, 'I will be a tree that you can come home to.'" What's the name of that song, Dylan? She sang it to us every night. Don't you remember? Tell me the name of Mommy's favourite song, Dylan. He doesn't remember, Jack. It was too long ago. He was too little. - I miss Mommy. - I know. I miss her so much. Me too. And I don't know what's gonna happen to us. - We're gonna be all right. - No, we're not. Nothing's all right. Then we're gonna make it all right. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Cry for your mother, Jackie. Cry for her. "Jack the Bear." Say it again. Can you say it? Say it again. Say it again. - "Jack the Bear." - "Jack the Bear." "Jack the Bear." "Jack the Bear." Hey, Mike.
