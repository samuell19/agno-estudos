St. Blaise-on-the-sea, "Queen of Beaches", where the season is in full swing. At the casino, a grand and gay charity ball is sparkling. Laure Maresco herself, the lovely countess, famous in the cosmopolitan world, is due to sing for the poor. The president of the gala committee, the fabulously wealthy financier baron Decurgis, is Laure's most fervent admirer. Another room, another party: one that doesn't appeal to any principle of charity. The son of a famous auto manufacturer and an impulsive gambler, Jacques Prémont-Solène plays his last cards. "What charm, my lovely friend, and what taste! "I congratulate myself for having entrusted you, on behalf of the committee, "with the organization of this gala." "Save me! Save me!" "Yes, I gambled again, with the money you entrusted to me, "the 400,000 francs from the charity bank, lost! "I've lost everything!" "I've disgraced you... I'm a scoundrel... "But I still have, at least, the last shred of courage..." "Leave, Jacques! Don't worry about me: I'll take care of everything... "But lea ve immediately... go to your family for a while..." "Everythi ng will be fine, you'll see. But swear you won't kill yourself. "I beg of you, swear it to me." Laure's fortune, her jewels, had dissolved bit by bit into Jacques's hands. Now the countess only wore worthless fak es of her formerly magnificent gems. Now the young man had gambled away the money that Laure, treasurer of the gala committee, had trusted him to hold for her. What could be done to a void certain scandal? "I have some troubles, some financial difficulties. "Can I count on your friendship for... for a sizeable loan?" "Impossible, my dear friend, absolutely impossible. "Believe me when I say I deeply regret it..." In vain, she asked for help from several friends. Everyone refused. And Laure, the follo wing morning, had lost all hope for salvation. "Pardon me, my dear madam, for this morning visit. "But the committee is meeting tomorrow evening, "and we have the accounts to return. We need to prepare them." "Here are the receipts, the invoices... "There should be 400,000 francs in our cash box. It's not there." "How is that? Was it stolen from you? "No one stole anything from me. I stole it and spent it all. "So this is what you meant last night... But what did you do with such a sum?" "It's up to the judge to ask me to account for it." "Look, my lovely friend. It's an unpleasant affair, "but there's a solution to everything... If you promise me... if you consent to..." "Don't blame me, my dear friend: my admiration for you made me lose my head. "Come tomorrow evening to the committee meeting. I will try to sort everything out." Jacques's father, the great industrialist whose automobiles carry the name of "Prémont-Solène" all over Europe, is a tough and vigorous man who sets to work the minute he awakes. Scandal in the offing. The heirs of industrial tycoons tak e it easy, as it seems. The young Jacques Pr. M. nt-S.lène, for instance, gambles every night at Saint-Blaise, losing each time enough money to buy ten of the famous cars his father sells at high price. But the lovely Countess M. R.sco is said to pay for the expenses of the prodigal son... "Scandalous! Literally scandalous! Sullying his name... the name of my firm. "Telegram this scoundrel immediately..." "Mr. Jacques has just arrived from St. Blaise. He asks if you will receive him." "We must put an end to this, you understand. "The story of your escapades is in all the papers, on everyone's lips. "What shame you've brought to the name of Prémont-Solène!" "You're right, father. I have disgraced you. That's going to change, I swear to you. "But you must help me this one last time; I must pay back..." "Nothing! Not a penny, you hear? "For too long I've been foolish enough to believe your promises!" "Enough! You're going to leave on the next ship for the United States, "with 2,000 francs per month. If you need more, you'll work, like me!" Meanwhile, the baron Decurgis, who hadn't abandoned Laure, was planning a new bit of blackmail... "Alas, I've done everything I can, to no avail. "But you know, my dear Laure, one word from you will put my fortune at your disposal. Enough of this farce! Last night's gala produced 400,000 fr ancs... "The money was on deposit... But I spent it... I stole it!" The baron was struck by a certain nobility in this gesture. He didn't want any complaint to be filed against her. But Laure, overcome with shame and impoverished by Jacques's misconduct, Laure, whom everybody celebrated only a few days before... March, 1904. Laure, my beloved, goodbye! I was forced to leave! I no longer have any means of going against my father. In my horrible grief at leaving you, my only comfort is to confess to you. I stole. I stole. I stole. Turn me in wherever and... ...whenever you like. Do what you want with this confession written and signed by me, who am unworthy of your devotion, unworthy of your pity, unworthy of the salvation you've given me. My beloved Laure, goodbye! Jacques Prémont-Solène. "Goodbye, my beloved..." This was all that Jacques could say to the woman who had sacrificed ev erything for him - the woman who would soon become a mo ther because of him! But already pulsing within her flesh was the promise of a new life. Already within her spoke another love, and its voice was stronger. A year passed slowly without any news from the absent one. Laure, to feed and raise her little Jacques, had now exhausted the last of her resources. "Trust me, my dear lady. The gentleman is my cousin. "He heard you sing at the casino once, and he real ly knows his way around!" "Of course, my little theatre can only offer you modest fees. "But this will be a beginning for you, and later, maybe..." Years had passed. Jacques, son of the exiled Jacques, had grown up beside his mother, who had become a highly esteemed music hall singer in Paris. Laure, who had devoted everything to her son, was worried to see him so passionate and soft, inconstant and impulsive, as was his father back in the distant days of their love. "Were you gambling again?" "And did you lose a great deal? Too much?" On that very evening, as Laure was getting ready to leave for the theatre... "Debts again? Confess, at least! How much?" "Thirty-two thousand." The money Laure earned singing at the cabaret everynight was mostly spent this way. "Here's twenty thousand. "When I get to the Crystal, I'll ask for my two weeks in advance. "You'll have the rest tonight." "Your hands! They're just like your father's. It frightens me, sometimes. "Promise me you wont gamble anymore, my dear child..." One of San Franciscos most fortunate stockholders had come to stay in a hotel on the Champs-Elysées with his secretary. By chance, business had brought to Paris, for the first time in twenty years, Jacques Prémont-Solène, who had become a powerful and serious man. "And now you're an American millionaire. "I hear you've got a monopoly on all the investments in oil. "What a claim to fame! Would you nevertheless consent to pass the evening with me?" "A 24 Prémont-Solène: the best of the best. "The father: king of automobile in Europe; the son: king of oil in America... "What a dynasty!" At the International Club. INTERNATIONAL CLUB Evening of the twenty-fourth of March With Mrs. LAURE MARESCO, the famous lyrical actress, in her creations For twenty years, Jacques hadn't touched a card. How futile this gambling fever seemed now... Luck. A perfect betting system. "Did you hear what happened? "Someone stole a roll of a hundred 500-franc chips from the bank tonight. But these chips are new, easy to identify. The investigation will be a snap." "Banco!" "Banco on one or both tables?" "On both tables!" "Tell me... is Mr. Maresco at the club this evening?" "Mr. Maresco just went to the cloakroom. He complains of a migraine." The stolen chips. "What a blunder! He's the king of oil... the son of the manufacturer Prémont-Solène!" "Wait a minute! "I won these new chips from a young man who played banco against me... "a pale young man with brown hair." "Wasn't it the young man who was recently admitted? "You know him: he's the son of that actress. "I saw him rushing out just a minute ago." "I think, sir, that you'd easily recognize this gambler. "Would you do us the service of coming with us to his house?" "Mother!" "Save me! Save me!" "Save me! Save me!" "Calm down! I'll take care of everythi ng. But leave! Leave immediately. "Stay away from Paris for some time..." "You said this young gambler was the son of an actress. Which actress?" "The one you must have heard tonight: Maresco!" "So we're going to Mrs. Maresco's?" How Jacques would have liked at this moment to be able to pay off the manager and ask him to bury the case. "Is this Mr. Maresco's residence? We'd like to see him right away." "Two gentlemen would like to see you, sir. "They say they are friends of yours here for an urgent matter." "Truly this task hardly befits a gentleman. Besides, I may be mistaken." "Do you recognize this gentleman, against whom you played banco tonight and lost?" "I don 't remember so well... there were so many players." "What have you done? That's your son!" "My son? Or somebody else's?" "Not your son? Have you seen his hands? They're just like yours... "and they've acted just as yours once acted!" "...his hands... just like yours..." March, 1904. Laure, my beloved, goodbye! I was forced to leave! I no longer have any means of going against my father. March, 1904. Laure, my beloved, goodbye! I was forced to leave! In the morning. "The manager of the International Club wishes to see you urgently. "The doorman had to let him pass... he's coming up." "Ah! Must I give you 50,000 francs so that you stop bothering me with this business?" "I quite understand... it's very unpleasant... "But you see, your testimony is absolutely necessary for the first inquest." "You've got to do this for me: I introduced you at the club, "and I'm annoyed with this whole affair!" "What will you do with my son? "What will he be like when he leaves your hands? Like a bandit!" "I've struggled, I've worked hard to raise him well. "And now, you must give him back to me: I will look after him better than you will..." "He stole it for me. I 'm the only one here who is guilty!" "Well then, know this! The thief is not my son. It's this man... "I accuse this man, and I can prove it!" "Si r... forgive me. But I must ask you to take a look at this." "This is all true. I stole 50,000 francs worth of chips from the club last night." "What are you waiting for? Arrest me." "Don't look for an explanation. I stole. "But I believe that everything can be sorted out fairly simply: "you withdraw your complaint and..." Naturally, things could only get better. The young man was restored to his mother. "A thief! I am mother to a thief! What to do now? "I ha ve given everything to make people think you're honest... "I don't even have enough to escape the scorn of all these people." "But who is this man, who took the blame for me?" "Your father!" "What are you looking for here... Jacques?" "I know that I owe you more than my life. "I thank you with all my soul. And I ask you to forgive me..." "I have nothing to forgive you for, because I admire you so. "As a woman, you sacrificed everything for the unworthy man that I was. "As a mother, you sacrificed everything for your child..." "...for our child, whose future I must now secure. "I can get hi m an honorable position in America." "If I brought Jacques to America with me... "would you come with our child? For his future... for his well-being?" "If necessary... I'll go there... with both of you."
