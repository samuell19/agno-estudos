Dude, you're gonna wake him up. I don't dare. - You're gonna wake him up. Urgh, with his hair as well. It looks so disgusting. And it's tiny. Draw some cum squirting out! - The dickhead, the dickhead... What the hell? It's hot. The summer of 2018 is Berlin's hottest since records began. The trees are so dry, we have to water them with huge buckets. And our skin is so scorched, it's peeling off. We shed our skins, and go shrivel up at the outdoor pool. Here at Kottbusser Tor, it's even noisier, smellier and stickier than usual. We're like fish in a fish tank. We keep swimming round in circles, from one end of Kotti to the other and back again, until we eventually manage to jump out of the tank. Dude, I look super fat. Yeah, right, Aylin. You're so fat, if you're at the beach, Greenpeace comes to rescue you. You're so fat, if you jump, scientists think they found a new planet. Bitch. - Spunk guzzler. You deleted it? - Nora filmed me from below, I look fat. It was a really cool video. Blame your little sister. You want some? COCOON Swallow, bitch. - Gross! When did you last go food shopping? Suck my cock. - You're so retarded. This looks fine. - It's mouldy, Nora. It's not mouldy, it's blue cheese. It's not blue cheese, it's Turkish cream cheese. Sure, like you speak Turkish. Wanna bet? There. Cream cheese. Got any OJ? It's zero calories, because you shit it all out. Loads of models do it. Here. Come on, Nora, your turn. Go on. Come on, swallow, swallow... Nora, open up! Do it. Eat it or I'll turn it on. Eat it or I'll turn it on. - Do it. Man, are you insane? Now eat it. Fuck your job, fuck your boss We're gonna go party, don't need no cash Gimme a smoke, gimme your beer The night's still young, it's just gone four Tonight, me and my cunts are hitting the club We rock up and all the losers look up This shit's gonna fuck up your speakers Cause tonight, me and my cunts are hitting the club Check them out. - What's going on over there? ...three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Get a room, you two. One, two, three, four, five, six... Give up. Looks like he's even enjoying it. Time for kissy-kissy... I wanna see some passion. Now he's really getting into it. Two, three, three, three... Yeah, it really hurts. That was five. - No, three. It was four, I counted. - Come on, one more. Come on then. Take her down, man. Not so hard, she's a girl. What a gentleman. - That's me. Equality, yeah? - Go easy. ...three, four, five, six, seven... Easy, yeah? How can one stand this, bro! - Give up then. OK, that's enough, stop. She's giving up, it was too hard. Enough, man. Kissy-kissy, baby. Yes, I'm enjoying this. That's it. That's the way I like it. You junkie. - He's really going for it. What's that on your nose? Go on then, big man. No way, wallah, I'm not doing that shit. I'm not some faggot. Six, seven, eight... Wanna suck my dick too? - Never, wallah. Sit back down. Wanker. Nora's turn. Hand on the table. Go easy on her. Nine. One, two, three, four... Go for it! ...seven, eight... Come on, man. One, two... Whack her really hard! - No mercy! ...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve! What are you doing, bro? Can't you see she's only little? Wallah, she's just a kid. - Nora, look at me. Are you messing with us, Nora? - You retard. It was an accident. Sorry, Nora. Breathe in, breathe out. It hurts. - You'll be fine. She's just a kid. - Get some ice! She's getting some. You'll be fine. - It hurts. Where's the ice? - My hand... I'm here, you'll be fine. You all joined in. Hey, Nora, look up. Man... The person you have called... - Shit. No need to smash up your phone, dude. It's bullet-proof. It pisses me off, she never picks up when you need her. Can you grab some loo roll? None left. Do it like the Indians, you've still got one hand. Here, eat it! - Nora, that's gross. Nora! One of your caterpillars escaped, it's under my bed. A really fat one. I bet it's gonna lay eggs, I'll have nightmares. When we used to breed caterpillars with Mum, you didn't find them gross. So? There are loads of things you don't find gross as a child, but do later on. Like how you used to pee in the bath. Or do you still? Yeah, and you ate your bogies. Yeah right, that was you. I swear, if another one escapes, it's dead. Jule? I can't sleep. I'm hungry. Me too. Those cotton balls don't fill you up at all. Those poor models. Look who it is. My beautiful daughters. In their pyjamas. Hello. This is a nice surprise. How's it going? I got some jars for your caterpillars. Mum... - Yes, my darling. We're hungry. - What? There was nothing in the fridge, so we had to eat cotton wool. Sounds like you're from some kind of developing country. There you go. I mean, can't you just go get something? Come on... Are you hungry too? - Stop! Sweetie... What's this? How did it happen? Playing "whack the finger". Whack the finger? It's just some game. - Just some game? Is it actually broken? Poor girl. What about your school trip? At least it's a nice colour. Blue suits you. Hello, Ms Novak. - Hello. Nora's joining you today. She broke her arm and can't go canoeing, and wants to be with her sister. Is that OK? - Sure. Come. This is Nora, Jule's little sister. She has broken her arm and can't go canoeing, so she'll be with us for two weeks. Jule, look after your sister, won't you? There's a seat for you. Why'd you have to choose my class? No embarrassing me, alright? OK, let's continue. What do you see here? A painting. Maybe a little more specific? That's the worst one of all. A strong opinion... OK, you want us to be honest? They all look like cun... like vaginas. You see? That's exactly what I mean. Alex is part of the artwork. He is particularly concerned with sexuality, so he sees vaginas everywhere. But it's not just me, we all think it looks like that. Come on. For the last lesson before the holidays I would like you all to prepare a presentation on the topic of abstraction. I want you to depict how you're feeling in an abstract way. It can be an image, a text, whatever you like. The pupils in 10A have been given the same assignment. You'll present your works in the assembly hall. So please make an effort. OK, ready... steady... go! It's mine. Let it go! One point to Aylin. I got it first. Give it to me! Go on, smash her. Loser. Ready... go. My top has come undone. Fuck. Tie it back up, Jule. It's almost 37 degrees today. The outside temperature is the same as inside my body. Will I melt if I don't cool down? Happy birthday, Mummy. Shut the curtains, I got a headache. Look, your birthday present. We pimped up your old bike. Nice. I got up an hour early. We made you a birthday breakfast. - Just leave it out. I'll have it later. BODIES THAT MATTER Read it to me. "My dearest friend Vivienne, do you still remember the time we spent on the island? I don't think we wore any shoes all summer long." "Life around us may have changed, but our thoughts remain strong and free! Happy Birthday! Love, Twiggy." Great. She's out all night with Twiggy and can't even have breakfast with us. I'm sad too. There's Sarah coming up next to her. Point the camera at her. Everything's bouncing, it's sick. I saw her changing, she's got stretch marks on her tits. How can you let yourself go like this? Don't be mean, not everyone can look as good as you two. Put a slo-mo filter on it. Check this out. Yuck... - Wibble-wobble. Final lap! - Final lap, we gotta go. Come on, one last push. Hold my hand. I'm scared of falling. - You're doing great. I've got crap balance. - Don't look down. Princess on the balance beam! Wallah, I did it. - Your turn, Jule. You can do it, Jule. - Go, Jule. Great. - More with your hips. Looking hot! Yunus? It looks gay. I'm not doing it. You won't get me up there. - Come on, Yunus. I'm not doing it. I swear it looks gay. Get on with it. You're right, it looks totally gay. - Shut it, wallah. You too, Nora. I'll hold you, so you won't fall. Steady. You're doing great. - Ewww. Relax. - Oh my god... I've got you. So embarrassing. - Can't she put a tampon in? Oh shit. Eyes on the beam. - Fuck, man. Oh shit! Ahmad filmed it. Busy! Open the door. It's Romy. Give me your jeans. I'll rinse them out. Are you in pain? A little bit. This always helps me. Thanks. Thanks Nora, super embarrassing. Come. Tampons come in different sizes. There are also tampons with insertion aid, so you don't have to shove your fingers into your vagina. They can absorb a lot of fluid, so you can feel really safe with them. Let's move on to your second option, which is pads. The problem I personally had with using pads was when I was asleep at night, because they can move out of place. I still remember one night in particular, I was 14 years old, and there was blood everywhere. It really freaked me out and I... You can either have a huge bowl of salad or a tiny plate of pasta, just so you understand. I guessed you'd started ages ago, you late bloomer. Do you have any questions or anything? I already watched some tutorials. Oh. OK. I've prepared a meal, for which I've used cottage cheese and a portion of sushi-grade salmon, which is tasty and very healthy, and which you can eat raw. I've also made a side salad... It's the 27th of July, 2018. In the sky above, the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, colouring it red. It's the longest lunar eclipse of the 21st century. For 103 minutes, the moon will be called Blood Moon. Jule's asleep, and I have a tummy ache. Need a hand? Put some sunscreen on my back, Jule. Nora, do Aylin's back. Her arm's in a cast, remember? So what? How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Screw that, I'll do it with Yunus. Dude, there's David. What's he doing with her? Who is she? - The new girl from the other class. I think she's called Romy. She's had to repeat two years! Minging, she's rummaging through the bin. Nora! Stop staring, it's embarrassing. Here's your ball, big man. My god, he's so cute, I'm dying. You're better off with a Turkish or Arab boy, they're more loyal than German boys. Yeah right. That's why your dad left your mum. She left him. But now she totally regrets it. This is how you girls can tell if a boy is into you. One thing I think all of you are familiar with is boys constantly trying to make eye contact. They either just stare at you, or even try to get you to... Jule? Does it make you happy when Aylin holds your hand? What? I mean, do you enjoy it when you walk holding hands? Sure. We're BFFs. So what do you need David for? Huh? That's completely different. But you're always writing on Insta how much you love each other, and that you only need each other. Yeah, but... it's still completely different. Can I go to sleep now? Look, you can twist its head. Urgh, carrot. This one sounds better: plum and pear. Hello. You're traumatising it, Jule. I have a question for all the girls. What would you do if you got pregnant now? I think it's totally irresponsible to have a baby at 15 or 16. Come on, we're still kids ourselves, right? I'd defo get an abortion! - That's my girl. But why? In other cultures, it's totally normal to have a baby at our age. It has its advantages. - Yeah? Like what? I mean, think about it. If you have a baby now, they'll be in school when you're in your 20s. That's awesome if you want a career. Oh, the businesswoman. No shit, then I'll be fucked until I'm in my 20s. No probs, your family can support you, dude. It also brings you closer together. My mum had me when she was 16, not that I find it great, and it totally stressed her out, 'cause my dad's back in turkey, also. But if I imagine I didn't exist... That would be a huge loss for mankind. Shut up, it would be a huge loss for me if Aylin didn't exist. I'm against abortion. - So am I, dude. Stop screwing around then! I swear on the Koran, you're not funny, you dickhead. So, who wants to try it? Being a mum... - Go on. ...or a dad for a few days? - I will. Take it then. I'm looking forward to this. - Shut it. Anyone else? - Yes. Jule, great. You don't even have a boyfriend. - Shut up. Sorry. Don't worry, there's still time. Maybe a boy as well? Me. Just to impress Jule, you dick. You need to man up. - Here's your kid, have fun. Careful, it's a baby. Have fun, take care of it. Did you do it because of what Zarah said? She may be able to cope, she's got a large family who'll help her. No one's going to help you here. Stop talking our family down all the time. Mum loves babies. "To avoid further inconvenience, I would like to ask young female residents to avoid wearing provocative clothing anywhere on the premises." He thinks the flasher will be back if girls wear short skirts. It's ridiculous, women are always made to believe it's their own fault. OK, but some girls here do go over the top. But we dress like that too when we go to parties. Yeah, maybe at parties. That's part of it. So you can feel a bit different. Yeah, but it's weird that different always means sexy. And everyone always ends up looking the same anyway. I used to go totally over the top at parties. I'd dress up as a unicorn, all covered in body paint and glitter. Boom. Cool. You can do it too if you like. The costume is still in the wardrobe. I brought something home with me. This is a baby simulator. You have to look after the doll like a real baby. You want a baby, Jule? Aren't you a bit young for that? Why not? I'd be fine. And you two could help me out. I mean, you would with a real baby, right? Yes. Of course we would. So this is my granddaughter. Hello. Or is it a boy? No, of course it's a girl. Our family only does girls. She doesn't want Grandma. Hello. We're doing fine. Hey, Krümpy! Krümpy, shush. That's Krümpy. She barks, but she doesn't bite. Do you want your tips done? Pogo's cutting hair today. Come. Right... done. Thanks. So, your sister took a doll home with her? Have you been looking after the baby as well? Not really. Not interested in babies? No. I'm seeing you all individually as you may have questions you don't want the class to hear. Do you have any? I sometimes find other girls really beautiful. Yes... There are many pretty girls here. But I think I look at them differently somehow, more like the way a boy would look at them. How does a boy look at them? I don't know... just differently. I also think women are prettier than men. But I like it when I get to touch another girl's body, when we're just messing around. It may well feel nice to feel another body close to yours. You're 14, Nora. At your age, you have so many different feelings. It may all change in a few months' time. OK... Thank you. I asked her how to get rid of the spots after shaving your pussy. What did she say? She didn't know. She doesn't shave. Dude, she's disgusting. What did you ask her? Yuck, Nora, it stinks, put it away. So, what did you ask? Nothing. As if. Why? I didn't ask anything either. I thought you had to ask something. No, don't! Another one of those junkie needles, dude. Careful, it could be infected. One big coup can end it all Flick the blade, stick it in Welcome to Berlin Lemon haze silver Black and white filter 24 hours 7 days a week Cold or not Her outfit's hot I'm gonna give her You know what Don't do frills Just count bills Fuck up foes with nine mils Clue, I'm the perpetrator Shout out to my interrogator I fuck your daughter Soon to be rock star Gonna wreck your home bar Coming in the night for a shake-up Gonna fuck you all the way up Pop the Glock Tick-tack-tock Cold as a rock Dealing's my job I bring the props Fuck the cops How was that abstract? What do you think? Was it abstract? - No, it wasn't. Why not? I dunno, he was just... talking straight, like... Concrete. - Concrete, that's it. Thanks, babe. Yes. What Yunus is trying to say is that it was very creative, Alex, but not really abstract. Because your images mirror what you want to say. They don't substitute by association. So, Yunus, have you prepared anything abstract? Yallah, Yunus. - Go, Yunus. Salam, guys... and girls... and Aylin, babe. This is my favourite trainer. You can lace it up real tight, like so. And this is exactly what I feel like up here, having to perform shit for you, just so I get a good mark. But... You can also leave the laces nice and loose. And this is how I feel when I chill and hang out with my bros. Thank you. Nice work, bro. - Smell it. Maybe two girls to finish? Linda? - I haven't prepared anything. Nora? "The Moth", by Isabel Tuengerthal. Does the moth in flight - fevered by the light - consider its annihilation? Or is its will to live renewed? Imbued with love, does it seek beauty in its cremation? Does the moth, enflamed, sense its dream now near, or feel fear? Does it curse its rash infatuation and dash its wings against the light with waning might? Does the moth, in death, sense its heartbeat drop, and realise this light is recompense of every breath and the reward infinity immense? That's it. Time for one more. Not another one. Press play. Have you returned your baby as well? No, my mum's looking after her. I found it too heavy, you know? It's different if there's two of you, but on your own... It's too hard. - Yeah. With a baby, you need to stick together as a family. Yep. WANT TO GO SWIMMING WITH ME TONIGHT? Why did you bring a kiddies' book? Yunus gave it to my little brother for his birthday. But I gotta take it back, it's for six and above. Really stupid present, dude. Learn to read. OK, chill out, man. No, don't do that. Stop it! No! Man, that's nasty, you're disgusting. Fuck you. It's lovely, Mum used to read it to us. Could you even understand her, slurring her words? Are you retarded, man? I'm never telling you anything again. Did you really think Mum would stick to it? I thought she'd drink less if she had a grandchild. I'll put a pizza in the oven, with extra cheese. And we'll take the doll back on Monday. Outside Berlin, forests are burning. Leaves fall from the trees, exhausted. Everywhere looks like autumn, despite the stifling heat in the city. But today, there's a breeze. Come on! Come. Get in, Nora! Nora! Come! Get out! Quick! Nora! Let's go. Come on. Climb over here! I'd like to have my own room too. I'd rather share, it's way more fun. But you'd have to tidy up. - Says who? You still have a visitor? - It wasn't planned. You look like a saint, Mum. I am, I'm working the early shift tomorrow. Don't make too much noise in this pig sty of yours. Please excuse us. Since when do you have such polite friends? Is your mum a doctor? She used to work in a law firm. But something happened and she retrained to be a paramedic. What happened? - I'll tell you some other time. I always sleep naked. Want me to turn the light off? I always leave it on. OK, I'll tell you. But you have to promise not to say anything. And tell me something in return. OK. I used to have a sister. She starved herself to death. She just withered away. My mum then retrained as a paramedic, so she would confront horrible things like that every day. My dad didn't want to confront them at all. So he went to Brazil. Now you. I don't know what to tell you. Yes, you do. When I was in the pool earlier, I saw something floating in the water. It looked so beautiful. All filled with light and water. But when I brought it up to the surface, it was just a normal plastic bag. Imagine if it were like that with everything that's beautiful. One minute it's there, and then it's just gone again. I don't think so. I can't imagine it's like that. IT WAS NICE BEING WITH YOU :) Where were you last night? At Romy's. The new girl? The one who's always chilling with David? Are you hanging out with her now? Why didn't you let me know? You don't let me know when you're sleeping at Aylin's. Was David there? Only in the beginning. Swear on the Koran you'll tell me next time he's with you. I swear. Now get in. IT WAS NICE BEING WITH YOU :) Shower time! Krümpy! Krümpy, come here! You want some too? Tilt your head forward. Pass me the dye. Hello, sweeties. Let me see. We just jetted over to the Caribbean. Jokes, we're at 'Tropical Island'. - Mega cool. It really is like being in the Caribbean. Except all the white breads around the place. We actually have one here, don't we, Jule? We're now going to do something super awesome. The slide! Don't read my palm. Why not? Because my lifeline only goes up to here. Jule always says it means I'll die sooner. It looks like a new beginning to me. Aylin is having a party tonight. Cool. I think Jule would like it if you brought David along. I can do that. Hi. You look cool. - Thanks. Is Romy here yet? No idea. Maybe. I need to show you something. Come. You gotta see this. There's a fox. Look, down there. Don't you like me? I do. But I'm already in love with someone else. OK. Who with? Romy. Really? Romy? Do you think that makes me a lesbian? No idea. Maybe. Well... I think it's cool. You do? - Yeah. Catch you later. Nora, you need to check on Jule. I've locked her in the loo. We took some powder. You need to check on her, I can't do it myself. I told her German boys are losers. She's chilling with a bottle of vodka, because of that prick David getting off with your slutty friend. Jule? - Hey, Jule. You took too much? Jule? - Leave her alone. Come here. Come here. Come on, drink this. It'll sort you out in no time. I swear on the Koran I'm never gonna drink again. Since when do you swear on the Koran? That's what everybody says now. I see. You learn something new every day. Ouch, not on my head. We've been invited out to dinner. We're going to a grill restaurant. Are you feeling better? Thank God nothing happened to Jule yesterday. Good job I told you, otherwise you'd have left. ...hard to tell what you actually consumed when you're eating out. ...and the calories I record... Nora, we want to know if you're with us. What? If you keep hanging out with that manky bitch, you can forget about us. Maybe she didn't know that Jule was into David. I mean, you hardly know him. I'd be super hurt if you kept chilling with her. Are you with us? This is a one-litre bottle, so I'm in complete control of how much I drink. When I get free I'm gonna get reckless Check check, I'm off Check it, don't wreck it Street dealer cash We're running like flash Flippin' from place to place Welcome to 36 I close my eyes My thoughts go berserk Cruisin' around Chillin' in my own Merc Sitting on my driveway For all to see It's fake for now But soon reality Inshallah To be honest I'm not doing too good My nose is bursting My head's cursing THC in my veins, My eyes blood-red caned I get home Mum asks where you been, my son I can't tell her I been dealing, a whole ton That's life Every step is a risk, bro You talk too much I'm gonna have to wreck you I love Kotti Kreuzberg Brother this is my world 0-3-0, we gonna fuck up your gang Your gang, your gang 0-3-0, we gonna fuck up your gang... No jellyfish. I checked the whole pool. Without you, it's just rubbish floating. Do you hate me? You look way too beautiful with short hair. Come here. Even though the butterfly completely dissolves in the cocoon, it remembers its life as a caterpillar. It remembers crawling around, having to experience from ground level what now looks so different from the air. Memories are all the butterfly keeps of its life as a caterpillar. And I of this summer.
