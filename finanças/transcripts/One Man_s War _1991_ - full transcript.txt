I really must get that air conditioner soon. I found something. Do you know what it is? A ball. Who wants the ball? Hi, Joelito. - I got your tickets. - Thank goodness. Careful with tose. - What? - Those. What do you think I meant? Expensive drugs, take them to the surgery. For God's sake, don't drop them. California, here you come. Yes, and we're left here with all the workk. I'm starving. You know where the kitchen is, where the food is... - Are you going to be on TV again, papa? - Yes, maybe. Oh my God! It must be a great strain, the life of a celebrity. Look! Those people out there depend on this place and this place depends on the... ...money raised from my art exhibitions. What are you laughing at? I'm not going to America for vacation. I'm going there for work. W-O-R-K. You wouldn't know about that, now, would you? - Hey papa! - What? Do people really buy your paintings? Yes they do. They are not obliged to hang them on the walls, are they? And sit up straight, Nidia, tell him. Doctor, come quickly. Doctor, please! I am coming. My family must go back to the farm. They must. Just relax for a minute. - Doctor, we're still waiting! - I am coming. That stupid, you must be crazy... The landlords will shot us, like they shot you. They'll steal our farm. Pedro, we must protect what is ours. - Yeah. - How? The whole army is on their side. Our lives mean more to us than a piece of land. Mamasita, please stay calm... Stay calm... Please, Dr. Filartiga, tell him, it's too dangerous. - Just sit down. - It's been our home for 20 years. Quiet. Sit down. Now sit down and be quiet. Tomorrow I'll go and see the farm myself, alright? Alright. Now get some sleep. And you tell her to calm down. Alright, stay calm. No sudden moves. Keep your hands on the wheel. Out! Move it! Papers! The famous Filartiga. - Why have you no papers? - They were burnt in a fire. You realize this is a guerrilla zone? No. Take him away. No, please, I can vouch for him. Please don't... Stand still. His father's a patient of mine. He's the best boy in the world. Without papers. Get into the car. Move! You're a big fish around here, Dr. Filargita and one day ... ... someone is going to fry you. Get the hell out of here! Now listen to me. We'll get him released, you understand? Good. Now you get some sleep. And you, you sleep as well. Alright? Good night. You see Dolly, this is why I go to America. To let the world know. Now do you understand? I'll let the world know, I'll add this... ... to the list of Stroessner's atrocities. Bastards! - I could not help you. - What? I did nothing. Thank God, you didn't do anything. You did fine. Joelito! A peasant is brought to you in the middle of the night. He is delirious... ...and doubled up in pain. What would you do? - Ask him what's wrong. - How would he know? That's why he has come to you. I'd move. - Concentrate! - Temperature? Okay, his temperature is high and rising steadily. - Can you give me a clue? - Oh my God! - What is the matter with you tonight? - Relax and give him a clue. Okay, he is clutching the right side of his abdomen and there is vomit on his shirt. Try the pinstroke test over the appendix area. If positive, follow with cutaneous hyperesthesia... ...and removal of appendix. - Hey, I wasn't asking you. - Why do you play this game with him? I'm the one at medical school. He doesn't want to be a doctor. Nonsense! Wait, wait, wait. Don't I have any say in the matter? - Of course not. - Will you please stop? Who's that? Who could that be? Who is it? Amerigo Pena. Who? Polizia. Amerigo Pena. If they've come to get me, You know what to do, don't you? Dr. Filartiga, my name is Amerigo Pena. I'm sorry to bother you. I live with Juana across the street. Her mother's collapsed. I think she's dead. could you come over please? - Yes , I'll get my things. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Is that her new boyfriend? We have a policeman for a neighbour. We're all gonna be safe now. Would you like some coffee? Yes? Psst, Duarte! More coffee! More! Amerigo-- Thank you Amerigo. - My sympathies. - Thank you, sir. - I'm deeply sorry. - I'm so sad. Thank you sir. - How do you feel? - Ket's go. Doktor. Let me introduce you to Colonel Arturo Gomes. - How do you do? - Chief of the Judicial Department of Police. - And his wife, Dona Armadina. - Dona Nidia. I'm glad to meed you. Joelito. I am afraid I don't know your name. Dolly. - Dolly and the little one. - How old are you, little one? - And this is Charo, Duarte's wife. - Dr. Filartiga. - I'm a great admirer of your mother. - Thank you. Senora Filartiga is a close personal friend of His Excellency. President Stroessner. - How is she? - I haven't seen her several months... ...but I think she's alright. - Good. And I hear you're off to America to sell... - ...some of your paintings.. - Yoes. Dr. Filartiga sells his paintings to rich Americans and uses the profits... ...to run a clinic fo the poor... in Ybycu?. Isn't it? - Yes, it is. - Well, there was quite a bit of guerilla activity down that way. Has it affected you? - No just more soldiers tan usual... ...That's all. - Of course. - Anyway, we must go now. - Have a good trip, Doctor... ... and try not to give us a bad press this time. - Doctor! Thanks for coming over. - Okay. It means a lot to Juana. Please, listen to what COlonel Gomes says. I'm saying this as a neighbour. Be careful what you say in America. Okay? - Don't forget to get some morphine, will you? - Okay. And dress his leg. Twice a week. Yes, I know. Look after your sisters, will you? Don't worry, chief, I'll take care of our girls. Papa, please don't say too much. Okay? Don't give them an excuse. Hey, a 20-years old daughter is giving me advice. your father knows what he's doing. - Goodbye. - Bye, papa. Goodbye. A teddy bear is brought to you with one ear missing and a straw sticking out of his stomach. So. What do you do? - Try the pinstroke? It's time to go to sleep. - Good morning! - Good morning. - Wait, what have you got here? - Medical supplies. Is that all? No guns? By the way. Who hit your father, huh? His face... - Soldiers. - Soldiers! What he doing fighting soldiers? There must have been a reason. Right? I don't know what you're talking about, sir. Come on, let's go. Senorita, please. Ride carefully. Have a nice trip. - Good game? - Yes. Let's see. Good, very good, Senor Ramirez. No infection. Papa has done a really good job. With your help, Senorita. Yeah she will be a good doctor... for a woman. And you, young man? - What are you going to be when you leave school? - Architecht. - If his father grants his permission. - Senorita Filartiga. Police. ...announces the arrival of Flight 302 from Las Angeles. - Dr. Filartiga? - Yes. Senora, welcome home. Come with me, please? My patients suffer constant and brutal aggression from the government... ...Including confiscation of their land, assault and arrest... ...without any legal proceedings. Torture is such an everyday occurence in Paraguay... ...fear is so widespread that they have become the very foundation... ... of General Stroessner's dictatorship. A dictatorship supported by the American government. How can a cultured and educated man like yoursel... say things like this about our country? Now listen to me carefully, Doctor. You may be a Filartiga, you may have powerful connections abroad... ...but don't expect us to sit back and do nothing. You are not beyond our reach. You can go. Come on, eat. - We are home and we are safe. - Well, we are home. These bureucrats didn't touch me. I'm too well known abroatd. Anyway, they're just trying to scare us, that's all. - Well, it's working. They mean it this time. - I haven't been arrested, have I? Trust me. Look, I calculate the risks I take. Come on! They are going back to school tomorrow. We're going back to the clinic. Let's at least have a drink. Bye, bye. Analy, bye. Good bye. Have a nice trip. Charo? Charo, it's Joelito. - What do you want? - I saw what happened. And I thought you might need some help. May I come in? Joelito! Who are you? We've met before, Senorita. I'm Colonel Arturo Gomes. - Would you come with me please? - Why? - There's been some trouble with your brother. - What trouble? Please. Duarte? What happened? Where's Joelito? Bring my brother here, I'm not going there. Joelito! Joelito. Wake up. Is there's the body of your brother, Joelito Filartiga? Joelito, wake up. Let's go home. Joelito, what have they done to you? Duarte found him in bed with Charo and went crazy. - He has made a confession. - Where's Charo? I want to see her. - She's not here. - She was taken to the hospital. - But I want to see her. In good time. Where are you going senorita? We have to sort this out. - Your borther should be buried. - In the middle of the night? Get him out of here or I'll throw him in the fucking street. He's dead. - He's dead. - He asked for it. How can you say that? How can you say that to me? He's my brother! - Oh, you Filartigas are asking for it. - Amerigo, keep quiet. Where would you like him, senorita? The table. I'll put a man on the door. He must be buried, first thing. Get out! Dr. Filartiga, could you comment on your son's involvement with... - Were they lovers? - What's going on? - Dr. Filartiga, please don't go... - We would like to know your point of view... Sorry, Doctor. It's the death certificate. - Died as the result of four stab wounds? - The husband has made a confession and has been charged. Please, would you leave us to grieve, in private? My condolences, Doctor. Dolly, take your mother upstairs. Stay with them, please, Leandro. Papa! What are you doing? Look at this. Come here, look at this! Look. These are burns. Made with an electronic cattle prod. And these... These are bruises, which were made by high-tension... ...wires which we used as whips. So, pick his shoulders up please. Hold his shoulders up. Good, now hold it there. Hold it there. - Now look at the victim's blood. - Victim? It's my brother! - Look at the dispersal. Which was was it flowing? - Downward. - Exactly. What does that mean? - Papa, this is sick! Conclusion. He was stabbed after he died. During a fight, the contractions of the heart would spread the blood in all directions. You understand? This-- See this? They left it in him. You know where I found this? It was inserted in his penis and they attached electrical wires to it. My God! Stab wounds. Those bastards, they tortured my son. Those bastards tortured my son! Papa! - They killed my son! - Papa, no! - Bastards! - Papa, no! - Bastards! - Papa, Leandro, please stop! Bastards! Hello, grandmama. Filartiga family in scandal. Society son murdered by jealous husband. Husband claims I found them in bed. Now, you say your's son wasn't having an affair with this woman? Was he political? Senor Perrone, he was an 18-year-old boy. It is me they're after. They think I'm supporting the guerrilas. - Who is they? - The government. Why didn't they pick you up then? Why not question you? - That happens sometimes, believe me. - But they always let him go. - Why kill the boy then? - I don't think they meant to kill him. They wanted information, then just went too far. Doctor, I am a criminal lawyer. I deal with facts, with reality. The one person that could support your version, a woman named Charo... ... she has disappeared. On the other hand, the state is gonna present its official version... ...with the testimony of several witnesses, the husband... ...has already accepted his guilt. Verdict! Crime of passion. Practically unpunishable in this country. Tell me something, Senor Perrone, who did this? Was it the jealos husband? Or was it the policeman with fists and boots... ...and cattle prod, electrical equipment? You tell me, please! - Do you have medical testimony? - I am a doctor, for God's sake! You're also the victim's father. Independent medical testimony? No. If you can find something casting doubt on the official cause of death... ...then they might grant pass an exhumation order. Exhumation? - Won't those photos be enough? - Not in a court of law. If you can discredit the death certificate... ...then they have no case. But to do that... ...you need a proper forensic examination. It's the only way. There's bound to be someone who will help. Someone who was a student of me. - There's gotta be a name somewhere. - Joel. I can't bear the thought of him being dug up. - I don't want him dug up. - I don't either. - But we have to. - I want him to sleep, that's all. - Let him sleep. - After. After this, he will sleep. This is terrible, Joel. Senora. Very kind of you. What can we do? What can you do? You're doctors, for God's sake! I want you to challenge the death certificate. That's what I want you to do. - Joel, this is Paraguay. - Come on! We have our families to consider, to consider. I too have a family. Please. Please. I'm sorry. Nidia! Give me a drink! Whiskey! Anything! Please. I can't get one doctor to support me, not one of them has the guts. I'm ashamed of my profession. So am I, Joel. - I will sign your testimony. - Ah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's fairly conclusive. His last hours must have been very unpleasant. Do you realise the implications of calling an inquest? Yes, Your Honour, but the exhumation indicates ...my client is right. It is clear that the deceased was stabbed after he died... ...and that there were burns and other injuries not reported on the death certificate. There are question marks and brackets around the word burns. I have a copy of Doctor Godoy's original report. There are no brackets. There are no question marks. There's not enough evidence to call an inquest. Bring me soemthing else. - Your Honour, I think - Horacio, you have a brilliant career. This case could destroy it. Professor. - Hello, Dolly. - Hello. - How's your father? - He's fine, thanks. He is a great doctor. One of the best. Dolly, there's a problem. I really shouldn't be telling you this, but... Your papers have been removed from our records by the police. What does it mean? I'm afraid it means there's no longer a place for you at this school. But I've studied here for four years. I'm about to graduate. - You know that. - Yes, yes, I know. - But there's nothing I could do. I won't accept it. I'm gonna finish my studies. You can't do this to me. Dolly, it's not me. Your records have been taken. It's not possible. Come on, it's not possible. You have to do something about it. Dolly! Officially you never studied at this school. You don't exist. I hate this country! I hate this country! I hate everything! What are you looking at? Leave me alone! - It's not fair! It's not fair! It's not fair! - I know, I know. - Senor? - Agua Diente. Take the bottle. Hello? Hello? Doctor Filartiga? - It's okay. I'm not a policeman. - What do you want? I know someone who saw your son the night he died. Who are you? I can take you to him. I'll walk ahead. Follow, if you like. Hello? Senora Filartiga? - Who is this? - Senora Filartiga, your son was a brave boy... ...but now he is dead. Tell your husband to be careful. All you Filartigas should be very careful now. They say you need information, Dr. Filartiga. - You saw my son? - The night he died, about midnight. - Where? - Police headquarters. - He was put into cell opposite mine. - Did he say anything? I don't think he could talk. He was only in for about a minute. Then Pena and Escurra came for him. Pena? Amerigo Pena? You know this man? - I know all those bastards. - Would you say this in court? - Are you kidding? - At least, give me their names. Look at that. It's a list of everyone who was on duty at the police headquerters... ...the night Joelito died.. - So? - The witness saw Joelito there. - Who is this witness? Doesn't matter who, he was a small time crook. - He was in the cell opposite. - Small time crook? Yes, and Pena was there. Amerigo Pena. Don't you understand, we can reopen the inquest! Doctor, this is practically the complete police force. Look, I'm not asking you to charge them, I'm asking you to call them as witnesses. - That's all. - Come on, Doctor. Enough is enough. Why don't you try living in the real world? The real world? Senor Perrone, in the real world, my son is crushed like an insect... ...and I'm expected to do nothing about it. In the real world, the doctors work only for money. And peasants die, because they can't afford treatment. In the real world, men turn their backs to cruelty, torture and injustice. I don't think I like this real world, Senor Perrone. What about you? - I never promised you anything. - What sort of a lawyer are you? What sort of a man? You have a choice, Senor Perrone. That is our evidence! We have a whole new case! - We've been terrified all night! - It's alright. - No ,it's not. - Nidia, we've got them. We had phone calls threatening us. Doesn't matter to you? - Don't you care? - Of course I care. How can you say such things? I know it is hard, but at least we're getting somewhere. No, you're not. You said trust me. You said there was no danger, and then they killed Joelito. - She's right - You! You were just as bad! You helped him. You sided with papa. And now Joelito is dead and nothing can bring him back. - So what's the point? - It is for justice... ...for your brother. - What about me? Huh? I'm alive. And I'm scared. And I want a normal life. - Do you understand? Normal life? - Dolly, listen to me. We can't let them intimidate us now. If we fight, we might save the lives... ...of other Joelitos. So please, don't let me down. Please Dolly, don't let me down. Senor Duarte... Please stand up. Thank you. I would like to draw your attention to the size of Senor Duarte. A much much smaller man than Joelito Filartiga. The difference between in sizes of the deceased and the alleged assailant... ...the nature and extent of the wounds... ...tof he injuries lead us to believe that they were inflicted by more than one person. Silence. Senor Duarte. How did you get the copper wire in him? Was it difficult? Did he fight back? How many men held them down for you? What are you trying to say, Dr. Perrone? We have received information, that Joelito Filartiga was seen at the police station... ...on the night he died. Silence! Silence! For these reasons, we would like to ask you to call polizia ... Roberto Escurra, polizia Amerigo Pena, Colonel Arturo... and this list of policemen who were on duty on the night Joelito Filartiga died. Silence! Silence! - Anything else, Dr. Perrone? - Yes, Your Honour. We further respectfully request that the official cause of death be changed... ...that the charges against Senor Duerte be dropped... ...and that a charge be preferred against polizia Amerigo Pena. - What charge? - Murder. - You can comment? - Do you really have witnesses? Is it true that your son had an affair with Charo Villalba? ili?kisi oldu?u do?ru mu? - Where is Charo Villalba? - Gentlemen, please! My client has nothing to say. We're simply calling these people as witnesses... ...to be questioned at the inquest. At this stage, we cannot say anymore. Dr. Filartiga... I'll get ti. Hello? Hello? - You bitch! You fucking Filartiga! - Mama, papa! She's ten years old, what is this doing to her? - We can't go on like this. - We can and we must. I lost a son, I'm not going to lose anybody else. Now listen to me, I have lost a son too and I'm not going to let those bastards... ...to get away with it, you understand? No, Joel. I'm not going to let you destroy the rest of this family. Joel, I have great news. They're gonna reconvene the inquest. We'll be allowed to put our case against Pena. Not their superiors, they are still being protected. But we have Pena. - We have the man. - Pena... Pena... Pena... - What's the matter? - Nothing, it's great news. Great news. - Seen the foreign papers? - Filartiga, political persecution in Paraguay. The story of a courageous man. The battle of a man to prove the truth. Curious people these Americans. They keep the Stroessners in power... ...and give prizes to those people who fight them. Joel, I'm going to have to call your daughter to testify. - Dolly? - She's gonna have to go through the whole thing again. Face to face with Pena in court. Can she cope with that? She must. Nidia! Nidia! Nidia! Analy! Dolly! Analy! Analy, what happened? It's me, papa. - They took them away. - Who? The police. Will they kill them too? - Carlos. - Joel. Carlos, my friend. Listen, I need your help. My wife and daughter have been arrested. They are accused of breaking into Pena's house. Yes, I know. But why have you come to me? I want you to tell the truth, to be explicit. It's only a diversion, Senor Robledo. Legally they have nothing against the Filartigas, so they're trying to create something. - I can't do that. Carlos, do you honestly believe that Nidia and my daughter could do such thing and in broad daylight... ...with a police car outside? Come on! Don't be ridiculouss. Alen. They'll close me down. Oh come on! Joel. We'll do what we can. Perhaps it isn't much, but probably saved a few lives. - Maybe even your own. - Look, I don't want to lecture. I want my wife and daughter back. Now, please help me. Please. Is there any advertising space left for tonight? Good. Book it in the name of Dr. Joel Filartiga. And make out a bill. I'm not responsible for what my advertisers say. Hey Charo! Come on, let's go, let's go! Charo, I want to talk to you. I want to speak to you. Charo. Get in the car. Hurry. I want to talk to you. - They're gonna be released, yeah? - Yes. - But they will be charged with breaking and entering. - Well, thank God the advertisement worked. - Mama! - Did they touch you? - No. - Are you alright? - I'm fine, papa. - Where are you going? - Back to the clinic. - Nidia, please. - I'm tired, Joel. - Yes, I know. - No, you don't. No, you are untouched by reality. You think you can change the world. No. You can't win. They let us go this time. What... What about the next? And the time after that? Everything has to be your way. You don't listen to anybody, you don't say anything. If you did, my son would be alive. You run this family like they run this country. Senora. Everything is back. Thank you, Leandro. Finish your milk, Analy. Take your things to the car. Wait for me there. Your milk, Analy. Mama, I'm staying. Do you honestly think that if you leave him, you'll stop him? - Come with me, please. - I'll not let them ...intimidate me, mama. I'm not giving them the satisfaction. You go to the clinic, you are needed there. Papa needs me here, for the inquest. Senor Filartiga, how does your family feel about this? Will your mother be at the inquest? Is there any new evidence for the inquest? Dr. Filartiga? - The judge wants to see you in his chamber. - The judge wants to see me? Yes, sir. Please, be seated. Another delay doctor. I'm afraid your lawyer, Senor Perrone has been arrested. What? We're investigating irregularities in his taxes. - But I want to see him. - Don't worry. Colonel Gomes assured me he will be released soon. When? You see my problem, Dr. Filartiga. I have to postpone the inquest... ...until you have proper representation. - Do you have another lawyer? You know he doesn't. Who would accept the case? The process remains open. I want to reschedule the inquest. This is a country where the law rules. Find another lawyer... ...and we can put this matter to rest. - And one more thing, Doctor. There is a problem with Pena. He has disappeared. Without him, you have no case. But colonel Gomes and the police are looking for him. Papa, you have done what you can. There is nothing else you can do. Let's go back to the clinic. It's enough. Enough. Papa! Where are you going? Papa! Papa! Where are you going? Lights! Fire! Shoot me! Shoot me! I am Filartiga! Shoot me! Shoot! Shoot me! Are you okay? We won't keep you, doctor. Why should we harm you? You are a famous man. A celebrity. We want you to be free, doctor. Take your father home, senorita. Come on. Allow... Come on. Are you okay? - Welcome back. - Thank you. I knew you'd come, doctor. - Hey! Where are the patients? - There has been no doctor. Papa! - Where is Dolly? - She's outside. So good to see you again! Thank God! Doctor. - There is someone to see you. - Hello Doctor. Hey! How good to see you! - How are you? - I'm living. - How are you? - So this is it? Yeah. We need air conditioning, but maybe next year. It's so good to see you my friend. - So tell me, what have you been doing? - Well ever since I was disbarred... ...I have been working as an advisor in a legal clinic for the poor. I'd be happy if things had ended differently... ...but I involved a lot of other people. Including yourself. I made my choice. I have no regrets. Sometimes it hasn't been easy, but now I wouldn't want it any other way. I'm getting something in return. Something good came out of it. There is something else. The case is not finished yet. Somebody sent me this. They've seen Pena in New York City. Pena? Well? What am I supposed to do? Hm? Give up everything? Forget the clinic? I can't I could go. Yes, now that you know where he is, maybe you can do something. We have to find him. You can't let her go. We were starting to live our old lives... We were a family again. I know. But there's something missing. It's always going to be missing. Even if she finds Pena. Can't stop her, Nidia. Can't stop her. Mama. I have to go. You know that. I'll miss you. Bye. Take care. Take care of yourself. I love you very much, alright?
