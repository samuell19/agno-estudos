Of all the girls in the world why did l fall in love with Jessie? This is Jessie So beautiful... educated... She has a style of her own... lf l took Jessie home and told my mom, ''l want to marry her'' l am sure my mom will happily agree But why did l love her? What's the problem? She is getting married... that's the problem! Do you willingly, whole heartedly take Roy Thomas as your lawfully wedded husband? Can we decide whom we fall in love with? We can't go in search of love... lt won't last lt has to happen of its own accord... lt has to hit us... make us spin topsy-turvy! lt has to be with us...always That's true love... lt happened to me... Actually l didn't choose Jessie... That love hit me! This is me...Karthik l finished engineering... did a few odd jobs... finally...jobless... l went in search of a well-known director to become his assistant To me cinema is life... The money l had was just what my dad gave me... good friends...plenty of dreams... We need one more hand... Mr. Ganesh, my friend... Come let's play... l thought you were somebody else l have seen all your films... Cethar vessels... design engineer appointment... though your marks are less... it's my recommendation... So they are pretty OK with that they have asked you to join next week... l knew the day l joined engineering it's a lost cause... My life is only cinema... l wanna be a film maker, pa that means? l want to apprentice under a director learn the ropes... direct movies... l have written lots of stories When you want, come and meet me l will introduce you to some directors... l am working with two or three of them... Whom do you want to work with Karthik? Gautham Menon Do you want to make Tamil films with English dialogues!? Besides, he takes two years to complete a film... Hunt high and low... you have to come to me... l knew you would come... l have what you want, take it if you can Switch off your damn phone! The boy l told you... who is interested...Karthik yeah...studied engineering? He looks more like a hero... ln my next film he is my camera man... be in touch with him... will let you know in a few months This story is ideal for Ajith how he became a rowdy... a don and then Billa... Hey! this is really close to my office! Yes sir...just shifted here two days ago we are building a new house... will move in six months time... l don't believe in cinema... may be that's why he brought you to defend his case... Please don't think like that, sir To narrate a story to a hero one needs good communication skill... l wouldn't tell you otherwise Just give him some time... When there was no breath of fresh air in my life... dried and withered... That's when l saw her...Jessie That love hit me! Why did you shatter my heart into pieces? l'll give you my other heart to break again... - Dad! - ln the middle of the road... What if some car hits you... For a film... Hosanna...hosanna... (Praise be to love) That moment...one evening the time our eyes met the time l lost myself something happened to me... Touched by the sky... Dad's chiding words vanished with the wind... Hosanna... She just crossed my doorstep... Hosanna... that's all she did... l'm reeling... l'm falling to pieces... After she left l'm searching for my heart Hosanna... l came close to living... Hosanna... l came close to dying too... Hosanna... 'cos ...l'll say its love Hosanna... Everybody wanna know what l feel like? l feel like l really wannabe here with you lt's not enough to say that we are made for each other it's love that is... Hosanna true... Hosanna...Be there when you're calling out my name... Hosanna... Meaning of my whole life has changed l never wanna be the same... lt's time were-arrange l take a step... You take a step... Me ah...calling out to you... Hello... Hello... Hello... yo-o-hosanna... Butterflies in many hues flutter here and there in search of flowers A cloud...a single cloud moves here and there to caress me softly, drop by drop Hosanna... ls the butterfly here? Hosanna... Has the cloud touched you? You become a shell l become a child to clasp you in the palm of my hand protectively... Hosanna... ...to shower love on me Hosanna... ...to walk along with me Hosanna... just say okay...that's enough Hosanna... Why did you shatter my heart into pieces? l'll give you my other heart to break again...

You will have to elope... put a full stop right now... Besides, her dad is a lawyer Did your sister tell you? Your mom has brought her up that way An old-fashioned girl in a modern attire! Don't take all that to heart! What is it saying here??? You should only hear your heart beating Jessie's name Think how you can propose to her Next time tell your assistants They don't let me in...

Oh that's good Uncle, whets your height?? 'You are doing something to me You are doing something to me' Karthik...can't you keep your room a little clean? Dad commented on it's state... Dad wants to talk to you in the evening... He doesn't like your obsession with cinema Ma, l can hear a sweet voice inside... Anu has brought any friends of hers? Home? Jessie from upstairs Oh, that girl?? Then one day...suddenly... Jessie at my place Jessie, this is my brother... you've never met him, right? l know...your folks keep calling your name throughout the day can hear it upstairs daily... so even you know l am jobless! l didn't say that!

Right from my birth l like Kerala... l visit it often Especially steam cake and chick pea curry for breakfast l always hunt for that and eat it You get more than that in Kerala Your village... where's your home in Kerala? Pulinkunnu My parents are from Pulinkunnu Dad's mom is there That's why l like Kerala She's very sweet Go there once a year... For her sake... Did you do MCA after your BSc? l can't believe that? You like Math that much? Ya very much...that's the secret... lf you like math it becomes easy You did engineering? He just wants to become a film maker... Film maker Let's see...not easy... easier to pass Math than cinema... l'll definitely become a director! My dad won't even let us watch a film! lt's considered a sin in our community! l have seen five films in my entire life... that too without my dad's knowledge... Do you want to leave Karthik? She hardly watches films... my hopes got dashed l didn't have heart to leave the room What?. She and her questions!! With a '1-track mind'... zeroed in on her... You are not following me? Are you? l think you are following me! This is where my office is l work here KFC is also here! l love eating here l asked just like that Are you saying you will buy for me too?

You forgot something? l don't wannabe your brother, Jessie l don't either, l already have one... that's enough No...no...l have a younger sister... l will accept every one in this world as my sister here after...EXCEPT you! Why? 'Cos l like you... Felt l had professed my love too soon wanted to apologise... couldn't find her What?. Your 'love' is in Kerala How do you know? l was talking to her mom Saw you going round and round the house... She isn't here, gone to visit her granny won�t be back for a week Even before my sister finished talking l knew l would go to Kerala Some guys go to even America for their love... why can't l go to Allepey! Pleaded with Ganesh sir to accompany me He agreed, under the guise of seeing location for his film Actually he only spent! With what confidence did we come here? walking endlessly... my knees have gone for a sixer! my head is splitting... at least now call your sister ask her to find out from Jessie's mom more details Find some relevant clue Have you come with the idea of sight-seeing Kerala? l will leave in two days, l have to start my shoot...

No no don't go... my folks will mis-understand l'll be within your sight... Why do you like me? You said 'l am crazy about you'... Why?. Do you think l am beautiful? ls it just with the way l look? Can't tell you all that... You'll know when you see it in my first film... lt will be my sixth film... No...you need courage... to see a girl and tell her that you love her You need perseverance... to come in search of her to another city... Yeah see...it's like... lf l want to work with a director l have to try to meet him... he won't even see me People around will treat me like dirt He may even yell at me... Must cross all that and take the chance Then my life is made lf l thought why all these hassles and sat at home... then...l'll just sit forever Just an example l could relate to And also its the matter of the heart My heart and mind just got connected and brought me here... You talk well... The first day l saw you Cross my heart! The moon above faded in its glow! My heart just flipped... l even somersaulted you know... Has no one ever come after you?

How dare you hold my hand? ...in the train! l kissed you after that You didn't stop me... lsn't this love? l touched your feet... You didn't object... This is love...isn't it Jessie? Did you realise the fantastic chemistry we shared? it's there even now... l am sitting on this side... and l can't handle it l want to sit there with you l know you want it too l thought we could be friends That's why l said that all that got shattered in the train... This is love...l'm crazy about you and l'm ****ing mad about you There is NO love! There is NO chemistry! l don't know why l let you kiss me Let go of me Karthik This won�t happen Don't come after me Wanted to tell you this... that's why l came here... l can see only the hassles... My folks will never accept My dad will kill me... even my mom This has already happened to my sister She fell in love Dad didn't accept Fights and tears everyday at home She ran away... My dad brought her back the same evening Within a week got her married she has an 1 year old kid now My dad made me promise him l should marry the guy of his choice Let's deal with the problem later l saw love in your eyes that night in the train... That's why l did that lsn't it love Jessie? Tell me just that l like you But l don't want this Do you understand? Come here You are practical...sensible... ...but don't say' No'! You like me, don't you? Don't you feel it? lt happens only once in a lifetime lf we can't live with the person we love what's the use of living... This is un****ing believable l'll wager a bet Your sister cannot be happy that is...if she truly loved that guy lt's just an act l didn't do anything wrong You are not some one's wife You are a Christian dad's daughter l am a Hindu dad's son lf that's what is wrong... let me tell you now no one can prevent my life with you whoever it is...even your dad Only because l'm in love with you. This treat should have been in Park Sheraton Only half of that... now for you, sir... Why? Did she say only ''l lo''... not ...''ve you''? You are a genius sir! That's what more or less happened Says she likes me but doesn't want to take it forward... What do l do? Of all the girls in our city why did l have to fall for Jessie? She is most beautiful She is also most problematic! Just one question... is she worth it? Can give my life sir! Foot loose and fancy free... with no care in the world She asked me to come... l went l wondered what she's going to come up with now? Why did you ask me to come here? Didn't want to meet you at my workplace... Shall we go? Where? Wherever...we have three hours Let's go some place Movie? 6 pm show... we can see first half and come away Work...home... such a routine First time l made a trip to Kerala alone l had to beg my dad for that... l made up my mind to spend time with you l wanted to talk to you l said l have work till 8 pm l lied what? l said l lied Are you watching the film? Like it? Or can l talk? Like it...but we can talk Let's be just friends Karthik... Otherwise there will be too much pain... l don't want that Nowadays l feel like talking to you spending time with you That's why l am here with you l don't want to lose this lf there's love between us... we can't be free its too much pressure what people will think we'll be worried if someone is seeing us Can we be this without love? Can l go home and tell my dad Karthik who lives downstairs is my friend we don�t have anything between us You can come up and spend time with me Crossing all boundaries... but not together No secrets...no ego... Nothing?? You are the first guy to kiss me l have not dated any guy l'll walk home from here What are you trying to prove Jessie? That it's no big deal? How can l delete my love? How is that possible? That too for your dad? How do you do that Jessie? Then you talk about your first kiss... You won't touch me... on the bike You thought if your hand touched me l would... When you were in Kerala l wanted to kiss you here Even if you are 100 feet away from me l feel like touching you when l am 80 you will be 81 even then l will feel the same way l wanna make love to you all the time Then, how can we be just friends? Do you understand anything l am saying? You feel like spending time with me, its only because of love... Take that love away... then you won't feel this way You wanted to go tell your dad...''the Karthik who lives downstairs and l are just friends'' You should not say that! You should say' 'Karthik loves me with all his heart, he wants to spend his entire life with me... ...dad, l want to be with him'' You told me your dad let you go alone to Kerala for the first time l think he has changed... Won't his intelligence match his 6.3 frame? He isn't the old Joseph you know He might accept me Will you go tell him? l hate you Thank you lf she doesn't like something she will walk away immediately... l have seen more of her back than her front! Not that l was complaining Why are you being so difficult, Jessie? ln your eyes you immersed me and denied it... Your glance was loaded with meaning... While l speak with love... you aim a knife at me... l dreamt of being close to you to caress you... l came a little closer and kissed you... Despite all this, is it right to deny love? ls it a crime for me to be a guy and you to be a girl? l am not your friend l'm the moon that lights up your sky... l am just not your friend You are the celebration of my life l am not your friend l'm the moon that lights up your sky... l am just not your friend You are the celebration of my life ln your eyes you immersed me and denied it...

You and me Only one full stop Only one line You and me will live together in this place... Only one our home Love is a wound My love, come running to me look deep into my eyes proclaim your love and heal my wounds My darling, come running to me look deep into my eyes proclaim your love and heal my wounds ln your eyes you immersed me and denied it... Your glance was loaded with meaning... While l speak with love... you aim a knife at me... l dreamt of being close to you to caress you... l came a little closer and kissed you... Despite all this, is it right to deny love? ls it a crime for me to be a guy and you to be a girl? l am not your friend l'm the moon that lights up your sky... l am just not your friend You are the celebration of my life l am not your friend l'm the moon that lights up your sky... l am just not your friend You are the celebration of my life Yesterday my brother saw you talking to me near my office l'm telling you, it will be a disaster... let go right now What about me? l am following you for a month... you are ignoring me Do you want any clothes-peg? What's happening, Jessie? Nothing nothing Jerry l am going down Ma, just wanted to know if you want me to bring the clothes down? am on the terrace... looks like its going to rain... No need? Shall l come down? Someone's calling me... Saw you yesterday in front of her office Today you are holding her hand on the terrace You think l am dumb? l will break your face to pieces... You... pimp! l hardly get angry He is Jessie's brother Actually l shouldn't get mad with him... But the word he flung at me... Then l thought to myself... l love only Jessie... not him! Jerry listen to me... Don't hit me while l am talking to you You used foul language first He called me... lf she hadn't come to your rescue... l would have sent you to hospital l'll rip you to pieces! But l didn't tell you something lf you noticed the way l hit Jerry you will see a boxer's style! Ya, l am a boxer ln school l learnt boxing along with cricket and football My coach called me 'light foot' Now you'll see why This is for hitting me... Fall at my feet, apologise and get lost otherwise you will get smashed by everyone here Come and touch my feet Jerry let me close the shutter Where are you going? That's not the scene now! Come back lf you had called me l would have come... why unnecessarily bring all your friends and create a ruckus l shouldn't have hit you There's nothing between Jessie and me the way you think l'll myself close the shutter ls that the way you want it? Come... What the hell! Don�t, Jerry...listen to me listen to me Ok come... l told you not to...you didn't listen lt's your fault Did you hit Jerry?. What's your hassle with him? His dad came and yelled at me Why do you put me in such a spot? Let's go in and talk... His dad will ask us now to vacate You won't be there to help me house-hunt Why did you hit him? l didn't hit him dad He brought some guys to hit me You want me to get hit and keep quiet? He came down and yelled as if you were to blame? Did you try anything with Jessie? Nothing like that... He misunderstood... Let's go in... Dad got angry 'cos he got yelled at... You said he hit you but it is Jerry's face that is bruised! Karthik, tell me the truth Ma, l was talking to her generally Her brother made a big issue out of it He tried to get my girl... Won't her brother get angry? lf my son came after your daughter... won't you get mad? Does that justify ganging up to hit him? l should be the one to give a police complaint! Ask dad to just keep quiet...go Your son is the rascal not mine! You think my son is jobless? Complaint to police? Go ahead, we'll see what happens l know he is jobless... trying to be a director? ls that a profession? He needs to be properly qualified to marry my daughter Your daughter parks herself like a car in my house... and you want a qualification? Ask her...she would have said something My son didn't go up to your house Your daughter is the one always in our house You give complaint... so will l... l will book him on eve teasing charges... he will get thrashed properly Let the court decide who is wrong This is my house...

You called me? l thought you loved me?! How can you hit your loved one's brother? How can you fight with him? Or did you listen to what l said and now you've stopped loving me? And so you went and hit him with that frustration? You think l should have taken the beating for your sake? You want me to grovel at his feet? l can't You know how much l love you Jessie They are arranging my marriage Because of this? Fixed the date now... they were already planning Did you know that when we were on the train? No...The day l met you here... told you l liked you... that morning They confirmed it today l knew this would happen But l thought l could somehow convince them about you But now after this fight l know what they think of you So...the wedding Next month 23rd is the wedding in the same church where you met me What do you want me to do Karthik? Go get married Jessie! You didn't come to ask me permission You just wanted to inform me, right? You have told me...go... l saw her just once after that She smiled... it was poetic... and made me mad too And then they all left for the wedding Needless to say we weren�t invited l want to go for her wedding What?

After asking them both they will ask the crowd l have seen it in the movies Shall l raise my hand and object? What??? Roy Thomas...Do you willingly, whole heartedly take Jessie as your lawfully wedded wife? Jessie...Do you willingly, wholeheartedly take Roy Thomas as your lawfully wedded husband? l want to talk to you... l don't want to get married l don't want this as of now She said she doesn't want this marriage She has stopped the wedding What are YOU saying sir? Please make my dad understand Jessie, what are you saying??? l'm sorry l don't know what else to do... l gave it a lot of thought but l can't go through with this right now... Do you understand what they are talking? Don't embarrass me Jessie ls there someone else? Dad, please! there's no one Mr. Joseph, what is happening? l'll talk to her She has seen us sir! There is someone... that's why she is like this! Are you asking me if there's someone else?

Cameraman should walk with the director... not have a hangover l will tell you tomorrow's first shot Karthik...come...stand there... That's the hero's position He's separated from the heroine for nearly 45 days... Pan from his face to show his feeling Our A.R.Rahman will give the appropriate score What are you so pre-occupied with? lf you don't concentrate here... it's like a slap on my face Roy, you've come early lt's up to you actually, you understand right?? What is this dialogue? ...blah...blah... no need of this scene But its very important sir l know it is important, but that is so clich�d which father has supported love if he did he won�t be accepted by the audience Otherwise the father will threaten to commit suicide How many films will have the same dialogue? Let's think of something new Karthik will be over my dead body, Jessie l will be happy and so will you be if you say yes to Roy We will have the wedding within six months. Do you remember all that l said? Oh! go ahead...we will wait Finish your call...we'll shoot later Sir...sir...light is just right He is your candidate... so you are supporting him?
