Creative association "Troitsky Most" Accidental Waltz Now...Now I remember what was there. A mountain. Well, no, I suppose it wasn't a mountain but something high anyway. A kind of hill. At that time it seemed a mountain. We used to gather on the top. There was mica there. You know mica? I don't know how to explain what mica is. It... splinters. It shines in the sun. I can't remember... Wait... "Little bones" [fulgurites] It's not that. Well... I have "little bones" [bunions on my feet] When I went to bed with him, I used to bend my legs one under the other. I was afraid that... Ever since I sleep with my legs bent. And now... There, err... No, I... It's like... Wait, err... Well, and then... Then I... Oh, I forgot to say... That's it... I remember now that I... I remember that when I was young I... err, well... Crying...err.. I loved. Well... I didn't loved... I mean, err... Well, literally, whatever I see, wherever I look, everything... Well, they... They... How should I... They beat me. No, I don't want. Then I... I got out of the habit. And he says that I am totally insensitive, that... that... ...anyone else could be at his place, that it would be all one to me. I... I always like how he spoke... He wouldn't say "it's all the same", he would say "it's all one". And since he didn't marry me... - Where have you brought me? - What? I brought you? - Wait, there it is... - Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Please forgive me. Does he live with you? Where's your room? - What? - You are upstairs, aren't you? What are we.. downstairs or what? For the moment, yes. Downstairs. Can I drink some water please? I'm so thirsty! It's killing me. Simply exhausting. Thanks. Tatyana Prokofievna... - Oh, thanks a lot. - Who are you? - Sergei. My name is Sergei. - He is my friend. Why did you get him drunk? Who, me? What are you saying now? Why, can't I get drunk on my own? You can't. Not on your own. No offense! I'll just explain you everything. You see, this is what happened. Wait! I'll explain you. If he hadn't got drunk now, he would have just gone mad. Be quiet! You see, they kicked him out of the College. He's suffering really hard, really hard. You understand? He studied so hard. He swots everything up and when he has to... - Well, what? - What? Well, I wanted to say... Well you see? He's always like this! He understands everything, like a dog, but, when it comes to speaking, he can't say a word. - That's enough. I'm tired. Get lost. - What dog? I don't understand. - Did you hear me? - Did you hear what we have to do? I had three dogs once. Tatyana Parizhovna is absolutely right. We're leaving, we're off. Get up now! - Get up! Why are you sitting there? - Where are you dragging me now? Come on! Move, Petja! Mind your steps! Listen: I thought he was renting a hole. And it's a real mansion he's found here! Lena, come here. Come here, damn it! Here! Come, come here. Congratulations for your family! Thank you! So many years we haven't seen each other! Yes, a lot. And how are you? Well, nothing special. And your oldest son... How old is he now? - You mean... Romka. - Romka. - He's already 5 years old. - Already 5! - Yes. - He'll go to school soon. Yes, soon. Next year. And where is he now? I sent him to my mother. Ah, your mother - I see. Yes. And how are you doing? Nothing special. Nothing? - Hello, Paulina! - We don't say "hello" here. We only offer. Here, have some raisins so that your heart beats properly and well. Paulina, Paulina! Stop pestering the poor man. - He didn't come for you. - So what? Wait, Paulina. Paulina, come here. Help me carry the potatoes. Come, come, let's go. Now I'll show you the ropes! What are you doing in our yard? What are you doing in our yard? - Well, stop screaming, Paulina! - What are you doing? What right have you got for this? We'll find justice! We will! And we know where to seek it. So it is! We are in our right, not you. One should have bumped you off long ago. - What's this sprawling? - Listen, Nadya... - Are you comfortable? - Listen, what are you... Relaxing, aren't you? Enjoying the sun? It's OK, calm down, Nadya. - No! - Stop it... You think it's a public place here? Nadya, stop! Don't get all worked up again! - My head hurts... - Go away! Now! Some inner beauty! What are you doing here? OK, stop barking! What's wrong with you? What are you doing here? You have no right. I'll seek justice. Just wait, I'll find a way. - Right, go on. - Right so! Right so! Everyone here comes and goes... And I fight and fight... - And then what? Who will... - Shut up! And why are you shouting? Why are you here? Some inner beauty! Everyone comes and goes here. With some dishes they go. Like masters of the place, all of them! Tatyana Prokofievna. Nadya. She came to Seryozha from our town. They won't let her stay with him at the students’ residence so she came here. - Hello, Tatyana Prokofievna. - Hello. Hello. If you behave once more like a swine, you'll fly like a cork off the bottle. Got it? Yeah. - Thank you, Tatyana Prokofievna. - Right. That's how to deal with him. - Get her back. - Right. Nadya! Nadya! Nadya, don't go! Well, why so gloomy? Well, we're just afraid that we'll do it wrong. - Really? - Yes. If you are afraid, then you'll definitely do it wrong. - Really? - Absolutely. Don't be afraid, give it a try. Well, I... Go on, let's try. Nadya. It's OK, relax. - You relax! - What? - Nothing! - Why lose your temper? - We're just sitting, having tea. Guys, we're having tea. Everything is OK, right? - How nicely you behave! - Yes, very nicely. - Want me to tell you a story? - Want me to tell you a story? - OK, tell! Well, go on; go on, we're listening. They left me one night at the train station. Scoundrels! And now they are asking. You don't say! Swines! Forgive me. And they don't even say they're sorry. Please, forgive me! I... Well, tell her to forgive me. What else should I do? Forgive him. Well, whatever! Good, all is settled now, well... Listen, let's play cards. The "King" is very "in" these days. It's a new game. - Don't take jacks or queens. It's nonsense but interesting. - Oh, not me. I'll just... - Let's try it. - I need to go now. - Really? - Yes. Pity! Come, Ghena. What are you thinking? Don't be such a goof! - Or can't you just use your head? - What about you? Come, I'm telling you. Stop talking back. I have a fresh one. I'm saving her. Well, are you coming or not? Our math teacher at 4th grade. - You also did... Remember? - Yes. Aunt Zina Chernova. Ghena, did she go out? Did she, Ghena? She's with a man. A man came for her. Shh! She could hear us. Ghena, you are so bad to us suddenly. Close the door, will you? Seryozha, I'm talking to you. - Stay off me, will you? - OK, OK. What's wrong with you? What's getting you agitated? What about her? Where's she going at this time of night? Where has she gone? I don't know. She's gone somewhere. - I think she's a tart. - You're the tart. Apologise immediately. She's a human being. What about tarts... aren't they human beings? OK, let's sort out our things. - You've made yourself at home now, Nadya?. - Stop that! She let me stay. Just when did she let you stay? When? Then. She said: "What's mine is yours". Seryozha, go on and tell her! Oh, I'm fed up with you. They just come and make themselves at home. Seryozha, let's try the blouse now. Great! That's it. Seryozha. Seryozha, sweety! Wait. Wait a second, Seryozha. What's this you put on? Well, how does it look? Cracking! It fits you like a cow saddle. I bet he sleeps with her. She's gone completely dumb. Oh, Ghena, you blushed. - Are you still a virgin? - What business is it of yours? Just so... We'll have to list you in the Red Book: Ghena, Russian, 22 years old, - ...boy. - Then we should do the same with you. You've been getting fucked from the cradle. What? What? What are you laughing at? I'll show you... Do you surrender? Well, enough now. Stop it! Enough! - Enough, I say... - OK. I stop. Not from cradle but since 13 years old. I’m keen on precision. Ghena, sweety! What, does it kill them? Well no, it won't kill them. It's just for the perfume. A perfumed death. - Do you know what will kill them? - No, what? - Rubber. - What do you mean "rubber"? - I mean "rubber". - What, ordinary robber? - Ordinary rubber. Look: finely ground rubber powder. Would you die of rubber? - No. - Well, they will. You see? You have to know what these soul mates will die of. Blast! Oh, Tatyana Prokofievna! What are you doing there? It will stink. How are we to eat off them? Then take them away. And where do you work? - Do you know what I love most in the world to do? - No. Filling in forms. From morning to night I fill in forms. - And where do you work? - Nowhere. That's not good. It's a shame. People have to work because work turned monkey... to what? - To human. - Exactly. Everything we have. And did you ever get married? Married? What does "married" mean? I don't know. Why laugh? What does "married" means. Is it when they put a stamp on your butt? - What are you laughing? - Why on the butt? Not on the butt? Where? I don't know. I'm so boorish. Where? Tell me, where do they put the stamp? - On the passport. - Aha, on the passport... There, you see? I didn't know. Well no. I want my passport to be clean. Absolutely. And you? Have you ever been married? - No. - No. There, you see how nice? My mom uses something totally yucky to kill them. - Hmm, is it borax? - Yeah. Borax - it's like love reveries, you know. Borax won't kill them. It just makes them high. - Has there ever been someone you loved? - What? A man you loved? Has there been one? Why are you laughing there, I don't understand. First she asks such a serious question, then starts laughing. I don't understand. What a strange girl you are! A strange girl you are. Well, strange girl, what do you think? You take it for a spectacle? What sit there? Stand up! Go wash the dishes! Wash the dishes. - My shoulders aren't right. - What about them? You'll rip them off. - Legs apart! - But I can't! - Come on, Tanya, dear. That's it! - I've got it! - Like a film star! That's it, Tanya... That's it! There, you've got it. Well, tell me. How do I look? Like a top model! A top model! Just shoulders back and stick out your chest! - Right. - Go now. Start walking. I'm starting. There, I'm walking. Am I doing well? - Give me. - Here. That's good but not for me. - Here, sniff it. - But that's for shaving. - So what? - Do you wear it? - What's your problem? - You'll have some man's scent in the house. - Leave it! Great! They're mine. When Ritka comes, you'll give them to her. OK? - Shocking! - And you get extra stuff with it. - Come now! What do you mean? We have a lot of nice things here with extra bonus. - There. - Wait, wait; just wait! - Wait what? Look, if the colour is matching What about the colour? Forget the colour! There. There it is, the Grande amore. Listen; something is missing. This is mine! Silver fox fur for collar... Try it. - Hello. - Oh, hello. Have a look. Go on, look at them! Banging! Look. Here, look. Which ones do you like, black or white ones? Terrible! - No, no. - Why not? - No, no. - Why? Why not? - Just so. Because... Look, this one is really cool! - Don't you find these chicks banging? - No, I prefer black ones. - How come? - Just so, I don't know, I like them. I'd like to meet a black woman, but there are no black women in our town. Pity, of course. Pity! - Listen, how about this one.. How much? - For you 25 rubles. - Oh, thanks. Model "Vietnam". Cool. Korean. What the hell, are you nuts? You... Go away! Go jump into the lake! Why I like this velvet? I get up at 6 and I put this velvet dress on. Colour... I chose colour, the one that pleases me that specific moment. I may be lying on the bed all morning. Drink coffee, smoke, then lie again. I'm terribly lazy. And velvet stays wrinkle-free, won't need anything: no ironing, nothing at all. You can put it on and go out for dinner. It's French velvet but it's glossy. Very glossy. I lie in it, I like rolling on the bed in the velvet dress. I'm the most fashionable of all women. Only totally useless. I also need to have a black skirt made, a tight one. With a slit in the back. You can use your hands. Go on. - What are you thinking of? - I wish I knew. - "The night is short..." Do you know it? - Of course I know it. You can't know it. How can you know it? Listen. "The night is short..." I was thinking... how about joining the construction team? - I'll make some money. - Really? Oh, Seryozha, take me with you. - "... and in my hand I'm holding..." - Where would I go without you?. You wish! You are never leaving here. Let alone, it will kill your mother to know about the School. Just don't write her about it. Tatyana Prokofievna will not betray us. - Right, Tatyana Prokofievna? - No, I won't. - There, you see? - But it's not possible to keep it secret forever. Don't think about “forever”. The day's gone, thank God. Life is short. What is life? Don't think about consequences. Live your life. That's all. Is that all? "Though I am almost a stranger to you And my home is far away from here, It seems to me, that again I am at my sweet home. In this empty hall, we dance as a pair. So tell me at least a word, Doesn't matter about what." - Nadya, will you have a chicken wing? - No. "The clouds are sleeping and in my hand I'm holding your unfamiliar hand. After the turmoil the town is sleeping. I heard the melody of Waltz And dropped by for an hour.. Though I am almost a stranger to you And my home is far away from here, It seems to me, that again I am at my sweet home. In this empty hall We are dance as a pair, So tell me at least a word, Doesn't matter about what. We'll be friends, singing and circling. I completely forgot how to dance. You'll have to forgive me for this. The morning is calling to the troop again, And leaving your small town, I will pass by your doors. Though I am almost a stranger to you And my home is far away from here..." There you are, little bird! What are you doing here? You're crying. It's OK. It's a good thing when tears stream. Otherwise everything stays inside your head. It gets so heavy you can't hold it up. Ah, these swines, what they're doing. But it's really simple if you want to do it. Take a piece of meat. Beat it. Roll it in crumbs and then into the frying pan. Keep an eye on it. Let it fry. On one side first. Keep an eye on it so that it doesn't burn. Oh, it's shining. And where are those two? I don't know. They went for a stroll. What they're pulling there, only the devil knows. No, don't fall asleep. Hey, what do you think you're doing here? And what's your problem, ha? Fuck off! I wouldn't go flirt with a man. I don't know. Not that I'm unattractive... As for my son, he didn't take after me. He married a woman with an "extra bonus". And she doesn't want to do the cleaning. I tell her: "Tanya, you should clean the flat every now and then". And she also has a child. Still going on all fours. "I'm not the housewife here", she answers. And I tell her: "You're damn well a housewife". "I am at work all day long. It can't go on like this, girl." And then I arrive and I find the door wide open... Castrato. Listen: "Castrato... castrated man, eunuch". OK. You don't have to read this. It's clear anyway. Page 366, second from the top. - Second? - Yeah. Hmmm, let's see... second... Cretinism... a disease marked by physical and mental stunting that may range to dementia. You want more? Where have you been? - I woke up and you weren't there. - I went for a walk in the town. And I wake up and you're not there. You got afraid? I got afraid. - Well, did you see anything special in town? - Nothing. You are dead for everybody, I know. You are alive for me, my precious. I'm wondering, do they pay for this? - For what? - For this poetry. I wanted to settle. Wait, Ghena, I've thought about you. Leave me. I'll find a place for me. Why did we come here, anyway? All Roads Lead to Rome, Madame. I'm not a "Madame". - Madame. - Aam! So. Voronin Sergey Sergeyevich. Right so: he's younger than us. - Which means, we may die too any moment. - I bet we do. I wouldn't want to be buried. Better be cremated. And then you wake up. But I'm never going to die. Never! - Really? - Yeah. - So, you'll be coming to our graves. - I will. With flowers. Forgive me, Emiliya Andreevna. I'll borrow these flowers. You'll come and visit us. Yeah. I'll come and say: "Seryozha, darling". Ghena, look, another young one here. Don't take from him. Thank you. "Russian roulette - a cruel game. Russian roulette. To stay alive till morning. So let's drink to the bottom champagne with ice for everyone. All bets are off, all bets are off, All bets are off, gentlemen. All bets are off, all bets are off, All bets are off, gentlemen." Oh, my little bunny, my little baby! Look who's here! I'll find you a place immediately. I have news for you. Look: third table next to the pillar. Look, look. Hello. May I sit with you for a bit? Why, of course. Sit, Tanyusha. - What's this whispering? - You may also sit for longer than a bit. Oh, aren't you happy to see me? - Very much. - Very much. How come you never drop by? Victor did. But I haven't seen anything of you. - I will. When I have time. - Well, I'll be waiting. - Good evening. What will it be? - Good evening. - Is this all there is? - Yeah. Bring everything needed, something hot. - I think this is not necessary, Tanya. - But why? I love offering, Victor. Do a dame this favour. - Let's split then. - OK. Whatever... I have something to explain, Tanya. I met Anna, you see,... At my place. I remember well how you met. A success it was. Right? Well, what then? How about drinking to friendship? - OK. You said...? - For friendship! - Yes. Fine. And how about you, Tanyusha? How is your life? You want to know? - I do. - My life is nice. Very nice. I got married, Victor dear. A general. He died. At the hospital. Yes. Cancer it was. I just don't remember what kind of troops he was general of. Was it armoured regiments? Was it artillery? Well, it's not important, is it? What do you think? The important thing is that he was a general. May I have this dance? "Chill is coming. Stars go aglow. Good bye. A bird is flying high From above you and I. Good bye. The sun is moving across the sky. The wind falls upon the water. Good bye. Thank God, nobody waits for anybody. Good bye. Thank God, nobody waits for anybody." Let me see your left hand. Why, Tanya? You've seen it so many times. I've seen and forgotten. Here. "The sun is moving across the sky. The wind falls upon the water. Good bye. Thank God, nobody waits for anybody." Tanya, what do you want? I don't understand. You picked me from the street and let me live with you. You gave me food and drink. Tanya! Tanya, why all this? Tanya! Tanya, Tanya, stop. Tanya, please! Tanya, stop it, Tanya! Tanya, please! - Tell me, what do you want? Is it Victor? - I don't know. What do you want? What? Tell me, what? What, what, what? I'll do everything. Tanya, tell me. I don't know myself. Don't be shy. There. I'll take this off. Can I hang it here? Yeah. - How nice you are! - What's this, what happened? - My shoes are pinching me. - Just take them off. That's exactly what I'm doing. Taking them off. So, is it better now? - What's your name then? - Yura. Nice name. - So, this is where you live, right? - Yeah. Right. And the second floor is also ours? - Of course. - I see. It's nice here, where you live. Cosy place. Wonderful place. - What then, shall we proceed? - Of course. - Tanya, dear. - What? I have a suggestion to make: Let's hit the bottle, shall we? Oh, you think of everything! Just so, purely symbolically. Just a tiny bit. There's even a snack to nibble. Some cucumbers, some tomatoes. A tiny few little cherries for little girls. - Great. - How nice! There, a tiny bit of everything. And shot glasses. Do we have shot glasses? - Are there any shot glasses? - There are, let me fetch them. Why should you? I can fetch them myself. Just tell me where they are. Well? Well. There! Everything OK. Shot glasses. Little, tiny shot glasses. Oh, how wonderful shot glasses! So, this one is for you. It matches your dress. There! Now some drink. There! Tanya sweety, let's use the informal form to address each other. Right? Let's drink now! To your health! Let's have a bite. Why do I worry? I worry so much! You know... I was sent to you by God. - What for? - What for? To protect you from the blows of fate. You are so defenceless! Yes. Yes, defenceless. And you don't know anything of life. - Life, you don't know it. - And you? - I know. - Well, tell me about it. Life is complicated and diverse. On one hand. "Girls are lying, pulling up their skirts, Guys are playing with their balls. Because according to statistics, for every 10 girls... [parody of an older song]" And you, you are totally defenceless. - But you have to take life as it is. - And if I don't want to? "If I don't want to", then don't go around to restaurants. I saw everything. Go to a monastery. Why are you such a little wild thing? So very wild! You've sent all men away. I'm the only one who's left for you. Only me. Little Yura, your little Yura. Tanya, little Tanya. Tanya. My little Tanya, enough! Stop it. Tanya, why did you invite me after all? Stop this. Tanya love, I'm begging you. Don't, please. What's the sense: "I want, I don't want." Tanya. Come, Tanya. We're adults. Stop. There's nothing to fear, Tanya love. Come Tanya, please. Tanya, what's wrong? Why did you invite me then, Tanya? Tanya. Tanya, my little love! I beg you, Tanya love. Enough, stop! My precious one, don't do this, Tanya. Why did you invite me after all? Enough! Tanya, please! My love, stop, will you? - Tanya. Tanya. What's wrong with you? - I'll unleash the dog now. I'll cut the head off your dog. And your head too. I'll strangle it. I'll strangle you too. Hell! "Unleash the dog". What's this? What's the matter with you? Stop splashing around with the cognac, will you? Stop splashing around, I'm talking to you! What's... Will you listen? You old bat! You stinking ass! Cut this crap! Now! You bitch! Cut the crap! Enough! I'm talking to you! What a great idea I had to come! And you, shut it! Shut the hell up! Whatever. He accompanied me to school sometimes. And I always tried to walk faster, when we would come too close. You know, kind of independent of him. Like he's not reliable. I pass the main door now. Walk up the stairs. And then, when I close the door behind me a glass door, I look: He's standing there. Standing and smiling. No, I do have a father, of course... Whenever he saw me, he would always smile. A broad smile. And then I look at him: his cap, coat, trousers. Yes, his trousers. I see him clearly; only he has no socks. I just want to get out... Get out somehow... I have such moments, always, when you go out... Just getting out... You go to school. Fall asleep there. Or you stay at home in the morning. And then you think: "Leave now". And then you hesitate and hesitate. You turn on the water, get into the tub, leave your hands under the water... You keep your hands in there and then you think: It seems now... I don't want to leave. I don't, I don't! Oh, I would anyway hate to go there. I hate that school. Don't cry. Shouting, barking all night long. And I'm going to have a baby, I am. Can I have a baby in such a state Val, sitting and smoking? Stand up and say something! Paulina! Paulina, you also didn't get any sleep all night long. Go on, tell her, tell her, speak up! Dogs, men! What do you think you're doing? Aren't you ashamed? Will you stop this hooliganism at last? Tatyana Prokofievna, tell us: Why because of you nobody could sleep last night? Come here. Come to me. Closer! Closer! Come to me. Aren't you ashamed? Look at her! Shame is lost on you! Come closer! Now! Well, dearest Tatyana, what'll we do? What was going on last night at your place? - What was that hullabaloo all night? - Be quite, Paulina, shut your mouth! - The dog was barking. - Well, dear, that's what dogs are for, to bark. - Men coming and going. - Men? Now seriously! Don't do this Tanya. Please, dear. Better don't talk and listen. - Why, what do you want from me? - That you live in a quieter manner. - Really? - Really. - That I become that small. - Totally. - That I disappear. Like smoke. You see, your dog barks, and I'm having a baby. - A baby? - Yes. Yes. - What kind of baby: a girl or a boy? - A girl. - A girl. - You want a girl? - I do. Well, a girl it is then. - I promise you a girl. - Oh, Tanya dear. A good girl. A beautiful girl. A quirt girl. ...and throws it on the floor. Unacceptable! Look where she's got me, Tanya, for God's sake! I would sit on a horse's back and fly away, just to stop seeing her. And she's cunning. So cunning! She knows what I'm going through. Imagine, she goes and leans out of the wardrobe all naked. To annoy me. What she has done to me! I cry and cry; I melt into tears. And she's laughing at my face. I've even started sending ads for a new place to stay. Tanya, are you mad at me? It's a shame how things turned out. I haven't had a wink of sleep all night after that. Viktor did sleep, but I can't put up with it. I'm telling him: Viktor this is not right, whathappened. We have to say a proper good bye at least. And he says: "Don't worry, it will be OK". Well, you know him. I'll come and visit you one of these days, right? I'm missing the old house and everything. Well, good bye! You creep! Why did you kill the cat, you monster?! Why did you harm the kitten? I'm asking! - What's happening there? - I don't know. - It seems a kitten was killed. - A merry life you people lead here. They suspect that boy. I know who killed the kitten. Tatyana Prokofievna did it. - What? - Isn't it so, Tatyana Prokofievna? - What are you up to, Nadya? - Just wait a little. - Is it a joke? What did the poor cat do to you, Tatyana Prokofievna? You wrung its little neck and killed it, killed it! Such a cute young kitten! And you wrung its tender neck. And killed it! - Nadya. - Seryozha dear. Wait. Will you? What's got into you, I don't understand. Get the hell out of here, all of you! - Nadya, let's go. - Seryozha, wait. - Let's go, Nadya. What's wrong with you? - No, wait. Wait, Seryozha. Wait. Stop it, Nadya. Calm down. What are you up to? Ghena dear, Ghena, let's go! Come, let's go away from here! - Come on, let's go! - Nadya, stop! - Let's get out of here! - I'm so sorry! I don't know what... - Nadya, stop, calm down. - Take this... Thread it! Get the hell out of here! Now! Me too? Every single one of you. So, you like it here? I want beer. Drink beer then. She wants beer. - She's craving a beer. - Seryozha. Do you remember that little girl at our day nursery, the blond one? She had just come and didn't know anyone. - I liked her at first sight. - She wants beer. Those big big eyes. You're so stubborn... - Can't you see it's a guy talk here. - I see. So, close your ears and drink silently! Close your ears! That's it. - I'm not listening. - Good girl. - I was singing songs then. - I'm not listening. - What? - I was singing songs. - What songs? Well, like: "A squad was marching by the river, Coming from lands afar." "Led by their colonel under the red flag". - I'm not listening. - Well? Mum has gone mad.

Seryozha, dear guys, let's get away from here. - Where to? - Let's leave. - You're really tiresome. What's this game of yours? Where shall we go? We're skint. Let's leave here. Let's leave. Stop acting like you do. That old lady is doing everything for us. She's a bitch, Seryozha, a bitch. What's this? Did you like your beer? - Yes. - Obviously. What's wrong with you? What did she do to you? Where would you be now without her? Ghena, oh Ghena. Couldn't you find someone younger? Well, in a pinch I would let you have me. Shut up! Seryozha wouldn't object for an old friend. Shut up. Shut up, I said!
