But look, I'm finna get up out of here, but make sure you tell little David to keep beating on drums. - Lord, that is all he do. But I'll make sure I tell him. - All right, have a good one, okay? - You too, baby. I'll see you later. Well hey, Nick. Look, I just need my pay so I can get back to David. - How you feelin'? - I feel all right. I mean, sometimes I have morning sickness, but we all right. - You know you don't have to deal with this, right? We can set an appointment, and just get all this taken care of. - Nick, I'm not gettin' rid of my baby. We did this together, you and me, so why can't we just be together? - 'Cause we can't, all right? - So is it because I'm not pretty enough for you? - No, that's not it. Look. Keesha, I'm married. - Married? - Yeah. - You married, Nick? So, is that why you keep me in these hotels. - No, no. This wasn't supposed to be all like this. Everything just started happening so fast. - Just give me my pay, Nick. So you don't have nothin' to say. - Bye, Keesh. And don't bother comin' around here again. - I hope you rot in hell. So my mama had a baby by a married man? Yeah, but she didn't know. After she had the baby, she knew she couldn't take care of both of y'all. That's when she started to get sick. So she dropped the baby off at Nick's doorstep. So you're telling me I got a brother out here? I mean, what's his name? Why did you take him in? She was so ashamed to have had a baby by a married man. After she died, I couldn't find him. What's his name, huh? We could try to find him. I would love to meet him. Baby, you already have. What do you mean? His name is Rocky Willis, and he would be 32 years old. Wait, wait, so you're tellin' me that Rock is my brother? Yes, baby. Rock is your younger brother. He was tellin' me when he grew up, it was a rough time, especially when his dad passed. That's probably why I couldn't find him. That's crazy, my own brother went through all that and still finds a way. A way to smile. And you had all the things he did not. - Granny, I'm gonna go to the neighbor and find him, okay? And bring him back here. - Okay, baby. David? Merry Christmas! - Jacob, go to the back. Who is this? - It's David. - Who is David? - Rock's supervisor. - Come in. What's goin' on? - You must be Lauren. I've heard a lot about you. - Same here. I've heard so much about you, as well. - Is Rock here? - No he's not. - And do you know where he is? I have something very important to tell him. - What's goin' on? - All right, this may sound a little weird, but that's my brother. - Wait, what? - Yeah, his mother gave him to his dad when he was a little baby, and- - I thought he was raised in foster care. - He was, after his father was murdered. - Are you serious? - Yeah, yeah. - Is that him as a baby? - Yeah, that's, that's our mother. - Wow. Hey, you. - Who is this, Mama? - This must be little Jacob. - Yes. This is your uncle. - Uncle? - Yes, your dad's brother. - What's up, little man? I'm, I'm your uncle. - Does Rock know? - I doubt it. - Jacob, can you go back there and get me your Christmas list? - Okay. - Wow. What's goin' on? - I overheard him talking about robbing a Christmas truck. - You serious, rob, why is he gettin' back into the game like that? But you know what, it's all my fault. - How? - Well, the other night, we got in an argument and, I fired him. - That's why he was upset. - Yeah it was, so do you know where he is? - No, wait, wait. He dropped this note. - You know, this is not too far from here. You know, I'mma go get him, all right? - I'mma go wit you. - No whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. You stay here with little Jacob. We can't have this generational curse going again, all right? - Give me your phone. Give me. Here is my number. Call me. - Will do. - Man, I don't think they comin'. King said his inside person will be here around 10:30. Shit, it's 10:35 now. - Is you getting scared? - Nah man, it's just- - Just what? - Damn, you don't want to be a man? - Here you go with this shit. - No for real, man, you can get out this shit. - How? Tell me, how? I'm just gonna be missing two more eyes, and then I'mma be in debt, just like you. - Man, I got this little rap thing goin' with my manager. It really could put some legitimate income in my pocket, you feel me? - Man, I don't want to hear about that bullshit. - Man, I'm serious, man. So this is what we doin'? - You see this right here? That's because of you. - Look I'm sorry, you right. Let's get it. - Think that's them right there. - Yo, Rock. Man, don't do nothin' you gonna regret. - What, man? - Man look, put your mask on, all right? I think there go the truck right there. - Don't do it. - Man, I gotta get it some kind of way. I can't leave my boy out here to dry. That's something you might not know nothin' about, you know? - You're right, 'til I met you. Man, you showed me what it's like for somebody to be in my corner, man. - Forget all that, all right? Come on. - I can't, bro. Time to get out of here. Let's do something better. - Knew you motherfuckers wasn't gonna finish the job. - Don't worry, I'll get you your money. But I ain't finna fuck up the hood Christmas party. - Which one of you motherfuckers is gonna pay me? - Man, what he owe you? - $5,000. Hey man, I don't do no checks man. - You gonna take it today, it's all I got, 'cause you not taking my brother. - The fuck, is this a family affair? Take this. - Man, this shit better cash or I'm coming to see you, man. Designer ass nigga. Gary, bring your ass over. - Know what? We want him, too. - This bum ass eye one nigga? Come on, y'all. - Hey man, that's an extra $50. - Come on. What's up, man? - What's goin' on, man? - Say man, I really wanna appreciate you for what you did for me yesterday, man. - No pressure, man, it's all good. - I wanna ask you something. - Yeah. - What you mean by me being your brother? You know you kinda said that. What's up with that? - I was at my grandmother's house the other day, and she had a picture of you as a baby, and it was with your mom. - Yeah? - Your mom, which is my mom as well, gave you up when you was a baby to your dad when she found out he was married. So yeah, we are brothers. - You mean to tell me you're my brother? - It's kinda cool to find out that I got family. Especially all these years, you know that I just ain't had nobody around. - Man, that's crazy. - I'm your big bro. Little bro, big bro.
