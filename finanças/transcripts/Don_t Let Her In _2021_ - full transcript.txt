(shimmering music) (bats screeching) (shimmering music) (wolf howls) (tinkling music) (soft, eerie music) (soft, eerie music continues) (gentle music) (doorbell buzzes) - [Woman On Speaker] Serena? - Yeah, hi. - I'll be right down. Serena. - Hi. - Amber. Come on in. (door thuds) (elevator whirs) We could take the stairs, but this is slower. Old school. More fun this way. (elevator whirs) All right, here we are. Go ahead. - Wow. Cool space. - So we're saving up money to buy more furniture, but I still think it's super comfortable. Here, let's sit down. Do you want water, a glass of wine, anything like that? Okay. - I hope you're okay with weed. This is a pot-friendly household. - [Serena] I am okay with whatever. - Serena, this is my boyfriend Ben. Babe, don't scare her off. - Nice to meet you, Ben. - Hey, likewise. - Okay, so look, we've never had a housemate or been, like, landlords before, so forgive me if I'm, like, scattered. But you seem really cool, so why don't I show you around, and, if you're into it, then we can do all the business stuff after. - However you wanna do it, but I'm definitely into it. - Cool. - [Ben] Business, that's your department, babe. - Thanks. Great, let me show you around. So we have the kitchen over here, obviously, duh. But Ben is a little bit of a clean freak. - [Serena] Oh, don't worry, I'm a clean freak, too. - Did you hear that, baby? - [Ben] Awesome. (discordant guitar buzzing) This is where Ben makes noise. - But I can use headphones whenever you're around. - Don't worry about it. I'm out of the house most of the day, visiting clients. - Clients, really, what do you do? - I create art pieces, little gem-filled bowls, tailored to my clients' needs, based on the metaphysical properties of gemstones and essential oils and spices. (discordant guitar buzzing) I know it sounds weird, but people pay big money for them. - Wow, no, it sounds amazing. And this is my space. (soft, creaking music) - [Serena] You're an artist, too. - Oh, I wish. No, I make poster art for these goody, low-budget horror films. People can pay good money for them, just not to me. To the celebrities at the horror conventions that autograph them. - I love horror films. I googled you, I know your work. - Wow, really? That's funny. This is a personal project of mine. I'm animating with salt, but I've only shot like 10 frames of it so far. - Salt has really powerful metaphysical properties. - Really? I use it because it's cheap. (low, foreboding music) That is our room, not presentable at the moment. And this would be your room. - Wow. - It's a really cool space. Plus, the neighborhood is great, once you figure out which streets to avoid. So, I have to ask, where are you living now? Why are you moving? And can I get a recommendation from a previous landlord? - Well, my situation is a little complicated. I was living with my boyfriend, soon to be ex-boyfriend, and I'm bringing up with him, and I needed to do it as soon as possible. - Okay, well, what about a friend or a client, like anyone who could vouch for you? - My clients are all super private, and all of my friends are my clients, so I can't really, but I can pay you guys nine months in advance. Thank you so much, Amber. I really love this place. And I promise not to burden you with my boyfriend drama. - Oh, please, don't even worry about it. I have had my share of shitty breakups, trust me. - It's just such perfect timing. He's out of town for a week. My friends are gonna help me move in, and he won't have a clue where I've gone. (door creaks) - Hey, can I ask you a question. - Sure. - Well, it seems like you know a lot of people, and you can obviously afford the rent, so why do you wanna live downtown? - I think I just wanted to get as far away from my old life as I possibly can. And I like you, I like the vibe here. It's conducive to creating art. I promise I will be a good housemate. And we can inspire each other. - [Amber] I like that. All right, well, I'll see you tomorrow. - [Serena] Mm hmm. (door creaks) - She seems cool, right? - Yeah, for a New Age nerd girl. (soft, eerie music) - It's so nice. Oh, yeah, totally beautiful. - I'll see you Monday, babe. - I hope you're not leaving 'cause of me. - [Ben] Nah, we have a couple gigs up the coast. - Wow. - It's nothing fancy. You know, band in a van, McDonald's and Taco Bell. - What's the name of your band? - The Cocklear Implants, spelled C-O-C-K, 'cause we stimulate the ear. Also, our cocks are more cockly than the other bands. - That's funny. - Welcome to the 'hood. - [Serena] Thanks! (soft, mystical music) - Wow, these are beautiful. - They're more than just beautiful. Each stone has its own metaphysical powers. You know the esoteric properties of amber, don't you? - Actually, I don't. - Amber attracts good luck. It transmutes negativity into positive energy. Careful. (soft, mystical music) Careful with that! That's the most valuable thing I own. It's thousands of years old. It was a gift from my ex. - Kind of a freaky-looking gift. - That's why I love it. It's pretty out there. - Right, well, I'll let you settle in. If you wanna hang out later, there's this really good takeout Thai place around the corner. - Sounds great. Thank you so much. (skittering, foreboding music) (Serena speaking in strange language) (Serena speaking in strange language continues) - Serena? What are you doing there? - It's a surprise. - Were you like chanting or something? - Chanting? No, I was just singing while I worked. Sorry, I do that. - What is that? (ominous music) Oh, wow, it's beautiful. Wow, and it smells so good. Thank you. - Black moonstone for new beginnings, amethyst and malachite for empowerment of female energies and wisdom, spices and feathers to lift our desires in the air like incense lifts prayers. (ominous music) (Serena groans) Oh my God. - Jesus! (Serena laughs) - What do you want, Amber? What do you really want from life? - Hmm, I want to be an artist and I wanna be happy. And I wanna have kids, eventually. Not right now. Yeah, what do you want? - Pretty much the same. Artist, happy, money. Don't need a man. Maybe one child. But I hate the idea of being pregnant, so if it does happen, I'd probably wanna hire a surrogate. - Mm, yeah. - Or marry a woman. - Ah, good idea. - Mm hmm, I'm telling ya. (woman on TV moans) (soft, eerie music) Good morning. - Hey! You're an early bird. - I hope that's okay. I didn't wake you, did I? - No. - Cheers. - Mm, what is this? - Secret formula, for health and creativity. - Huh. (phone buzzes) Hello? Yes, this is she. Yeah. Of course. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, yeah, bye. Weird. - What? - I just got the most amazing job. - That is fantastic. - Doing a poster for an exhibition of your art. You don't have to do that, you know. - I didn't do anything. I just told the gallery owner that I'd moved in with an interesting young poster artist. The job was their idea. - Well, cheers to that. - To new beginnings. (glasses clink) - Looks like your housewarming gift is working. - They always do. (skittering, ominous music) - All right, so I'm gonna start with some still photographs, and then I'm gonna take it all into Photoshop and sort of manipulate them. It might take me a couple weeks, but I think we're gonna get something that's totally classic and out there all at the same time. - I trust you. Smile or no smile? - Don't do anything. Just think crazy thoughts. (camera clicks) (soft, mysterious music) (camera clicks) (eerie, creepy music) (dramatic, tense music) (skittering, eerie music) (Serena chanting in strange language) (Amber gasps) (demon screeches) (demon roars) (Amber gasps) - Amber? Amber, what's going on? Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I was having a really weird dream. - You scared the hell out of me. - I should probably tell you, I have this anxiety disorder, an overactive imagination, and it's been better lately. I've been off my meds for a year, but I still get these really intense nightmares. - About what? - I don't know, I can't remember them. They fade so fast. It's like these bits and pieces of my life all jumbled up into this freaky dream. I'm sorry if I woke you. - Don't worry about it. Here, go back to sleep. I'll protect you. (soft, droning music) Morning. - Oh my God! I'm so embarrassed. (chuckles) - Don't be. My sister gets nightmares all the time. And crawling into bed with you, I promise, is not gonna be a regular thing. Unless you want it to be. (moody music) (demon roars) (Amber chuckles) - Hey, guys! I'm back! - Hey, baby. (popcorn crunches) - Whoa, whoa, it stinks in here. - It doesn't stink in here. If anything stinks, it's your dirty laundry. - No, babe, it smells like something died in here. What the fuck, man? - What? (eerie, foreboding music) - What the hell is that? - It's Serena's art. It's beautiful, isn't it? - It's a gift for the house, for good luck and new beginnings. - Smells good, huh? - Yeah, weird. (gentle music) - How was the trip? - Not bad. Played for some new people, sold some merch. Want a T-shirt? - [Serena] Sure. (soft, droning music) - Looks good on you, man. Let me snap one for Instagram. - No! No social media. - It's cool, babe. She's laying low from an ex-boyfriend. - Oh, okay, I get it. No problem, man, sorry. - Serena seems kinda weird, don't you think? - No, man, she seems cool. I thought you liked her. - I do, but she is kinda strange. Just watch your step around her. - Aw, babe, are you jealous? - No. I don't care what you do. - Come here, you. - Mm mm, not right now. Let's do it in the morning. Come on, I'm exhausted. I feel like I took a downer. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (dark music) (skittering, eerie music) - Shh. (dark music) (Serena speaking in strange language) (dark music) (Ben moans) (Serena screeches) (Ben moans) (Ben gasps) (Serena gibbers) (Ben sighs) - Babe? You here? Amber! Fuck! (dark music) (Ben knocks) Knock knock. - Oh, hi. Come in. - Have you seen Amber? - She went to the store. (Ben sighs) Don't worry, she doesn't know about us. - Wow, so we really? Okay, man, we can't be doing that, okay? I need you to help me. I'm weak when it comes to beautiful women. - Relax. It's fun for us to have a little secret. (tense music) - Okay, but what was that? 'Cause I never came like that intense like ever. What were you doing? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Wouldn't you like to know what? - Ben was just asking me what you told me about your relationship. - Oh, come on, only good things, right, baby? Come on, I got breakfast things. (dark music) - Hey, what's that green moldy shit in the blender? You forget to wash it again? Whoa. Cool, what is this? - Serena got me a gig doing a poster for an exhibition. Sounds classy, huh? - Wow, Serena looks freaking amazing. - [Amber] She does, doesn't she? - I heard that. And that green moldy shit is an expensive blend of herbs and mushrooms handcrafted to promote health and creativity. Finish it. Maybe you'll write a hit song. - Yeah, no thanks. I drink green shit once a year on St. Paddy's Day. - Wow, you look sharp. - New client. Wish me luck. - [Amber] Good luck! - And I didn't get Amber the job. She got it on her own merit. And I do look amazing. - I see the way you look at her. - (sighs) Come on, Amber. Don't be crazy. - Look, I know you sleep around when you're on the road, okay? - What, no, who told you that? - But if you fuck her, that would be really, really bad. - Babe, it is not gonna happen. I swear to God. (guitar buzzes) (phone rings) Hello? Yeah, this is Ben. Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, of course I've heard of you. What's up? (tense, eerie music) Goddamn, goddamn! Goddamn! - Ben? - Goddamn! - Ben, what's wrong? - This indie label, Ear Shot Records, they just offered us a record deal! - Oh my God, that's amazing! - Plus a four week tour opening for their hottest act. - That's amazing, when do you leave? - Leaving today. - Today, really? - Come on, Amber, this is amazing news! Don't make this a bummer! - No, no, it is, it is, I'm happy for you, I am. I was just looking forward to having you around for a little bit. - I mean, do you wanna come with? Actually, the bus is full. I gotta go call the band. (dark music) See you in a few weeks, babe. - Yeah. - Okay, we can FaceTime every night, if you want. - Oh, please, I have better things to do than watch you jerk off. - Hey, don't underestimate the beauty of self-defilement. - What's this about self-defilement? - Don't ask, it's stupid. - What's wrong? You're not taking off again, are you? - We're taking off big time, man. Amber will fill you in on the good news, and I'll see you in a month. Love you, babe. - Don't worry. I'll take good care of your girl. - Awesome, see ya. Let's go, baby! Go, go! (van cranks) - You know when you love someone and you see them in this certain ideal light? Then, one day, that light just sort of shifts just like a tiny bit, and you realize that maybe they weren't who you thought they were or who you were hoping they'd be. Does that make sense? - Ben. - I feel like he cares about his music more than me sometimes. - It took you that long to realize that? He's an artist, he can't help it. You wouldn't wanna take that away from him, though, would you? - No. But I wish I could change it just like a tiny bit. - You sound like a pouty little girlfriend. You don't need a man to make you feel happy. You're an artist, too. Pour yourself into your own work. - Yeah, you're right. Thank you. Okay, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. - You want company? - No, no, I'm good. I'm just gonna smoke some weed, clear my head. Thank you. (dark, tense music) (dramatic music) (elevator whirs) (dark, tense music) Oh my God. There's this really weird guy outside. - Elias. - He's been watching our building. - I promise, that won't happen again. - How can you promise that? He knows where we live, Serena! - I'll tell him something that will make him stay away. (dark, tense music) - Wow, your eyes are so magnetic and alive. I can't stop staring at them. - The camera gazes into your soul. I yield that power to a select few artists. - It's getting kinda late. God, we've been at this forever. We should probably go to bed soon, right? (droning, soft music) (dramatic, dark music) (Amber moans) (Serena gibbers) (Amber moans) (Amber pants) Oh my God, that was. (pants) - Shh, sleep. (Amber pants) (dark, drowsy music) (Serena gibbers) (blender whirs) (soft music) - Hey. - Good morning. - So, things aren't gonna be, like, totally weird between us now, are they? - Weird, why would it be weird? We're both consenting adults. It was good, though, right? - Yeah, it was good. I mean, it was the most intense like, pow, that I've ever felt. What were you doing down there? - Tickling your soul, the reservoir of infinite joy and ecstasy. It's an ancient technique. - Wow, well, I'll have to learn that one. But, seriously, you cannot tell Ben. I mean, you have to swear he won't find out. - Amber, come on. You're not feeling guilty about it, are you? I mean, for Ben's sake? I fucked Ben before I fucked you. - You fucked Ben? - That's not what I said. - What? - I said you should fuck Ben before he fucks you. - Oh. - Here, cheers. - Thanks. What's in these, anyway? Because it makes me fart like a butt trumpet. - It's a good thing. It's your body expelling evil essences. - [Amber] Ah. (dark music) (Serena chanting in strange language) (Serena chanting in strange language continues) (dark music) - Hey, babe, what's up? - Hey, how's it going over there? - It's going fantastic! People are really digging us! - [Serena] Damn it! - What is it? - Stay here, don't come out! No matter what you hear. - What I hear? - What, what's going on? No, no, take me with you, just hold the camera steady. (dark, tense music) - Oh my God, it's her ex-boyfriend again. - [Ben] Turn the phone around, let me see. (dark, tense music) - [Serena] Elias, I told you to stay away from me! I told you! (Serena speaks in strange language) - Jesus, do you hear that? (Serena speaks in strange language) - [Ben] What? - Serena, she's going crazy, like talking in tongues. (Serena speaking in strange language) - Babe, I can't hear anything. (Serena speaking in strange language) Put me out the window. Just don't drop me. (Serena speaking in strange language) - There, do you hear that? (Serena speaking in strange language) - [Ben] No, all I hear is you. - [Serena] Get the fuck away from us! (tense, dramatic music) - Oh, fuck. - [Ben] What is it? - I think I need to get back on my meds. I'm hearing things, just having crazy thoughts. - [Ben] Babe, let's talk about that when I get back. (soft music) (dark, dramatic music) - She's coming back. Okay, I gotta go, but I promise, Ben, I will keep it together, okay? Bye. - [Ben] Wait, what? (elevator whirs) - That was amazing. Seriously, I wish I had been filming that instead of FaceTiming Ben. - Glad you heard it. - What were you yelling at him? It sounded like Greek or something. - Words he needed to hear. He won't be bothering us anymore. (dark music) (Serena chanting in strange language) (keyboard clacks) (dark music) - [Mysterious Voice] Amber. (dark, tense music) Amber. (dark, tense music) - Hi. - Hey. (dark music) - Am I disturbing you? - No, I can't sleep. Come on in. (soft, dark music) (Amber moans) (dark music) Ow! Serena, what the fuck? - You're pregnant. - What? No, no, I'm not, I'm on the pill. - Trust me, you're pregnant. (bell tolls) (Serena chanting in strange language) - Ben is gonna freak out. - Don't be so negative, this is exciting. This is what you wanted, right? - Yeah, I wanted it, but not this soon. - Well, life is full of surprises. (dark, tolling music) This is for strength and creativity. Drink up. You're eating for two now. (dark, tolling music) That'll hold you til lunch. I have an appointment, but I will be back in a few hours. Bye. - See ya. - [Serena] Bye. (dark, tense music) - I miss you, Ben, I wish you were here. - I miss you, too, babe. Hey, how's Serena doing? - She's fine. Hey, you have a couple days off next week. How about you fly home? I'll buy the ticket. - I can't do that, babe. You know, I gotta be here for PR and shit. (Amber sighs) Come on, don't go Yoko on me. - Fine, whatever, I'll see you when I see you, I guess. - Hey, don't be mad. (dark music) (Amber farts) (Amber groans) (Amber groans) (stomach gurgles) (Amber farts) (stomach gurgles) (Amber groans) (stomach gurgles) (people chanting in strange language) - Ben? (people chanting in strange language) (Serena chanting in strange language) (Serena roars) (tense, dark music) (bowl thuds) (tense, dark music) Serena! Serena? (tense, dark music) (phone rings) - Hey, babe, what's up? Hey, I can't really talk right now. We're filming a video. - Where are you, Ben? - Morrow Bay. Why, what's up? - I need you to come home. I need you to come home right now. - Amber, come on, man, we talked about this. - No, there's something demonic going on. Serena, she's not who she says she is. - For fuck's sake, Amber, just go to Kyser and get back on your meds. - She's really freaking me out, Ben. I think she wants to hurt our baby. - What? Amber, are you hallucinating? We don't have a baby. - Yes, we do, we do now, our baby, growing inside me. - Holy shit! Amber, Jesus, I mean, that's crazy! I thought you were on the pill. - I was, and I wanted to tell you face to face, but I guess we're one of the 9% that slips through the cracks. - Okay, I mean holy fucking hell! Okay, we can do this! Okay, you know, I mean a lot of responsibility is gonna fall on you at first. You know, until we can afford a nanny. I'm gonna be on the road building the band. Hold on, hold on, Serena wants to what? - She's freaking me out. She's acting so weird. - Weird like how? - She's been chanting in her bedroom, and she carries this giant knife around. It looks like it's out of "Lord of the Rings." - I mean, that's not weird. She's just a gothed-out nerd, babe. - And she keeps feeding me that green drink. It's making me sick to my stomach. I think it's poison. - You should know better than to be drinking that green shit. Okay, but, hey, everything's gonna be fine, babe. You're gonna be fine. Just tell her to back off. - This isn't funny, Ben, it's not a joke. I found one of her weird voodoo bowls in my underwear drawer this morning. - Okay, yeah, that's kind of creepy. - Yeah, and you know what else is creepy? She told me that she fucked you while I was laying there asleep. - What? Okay, that's bullshit, okay? That did not happen, I swear. - Yeah, okay, well guess what? I fucked her, too. And now everything's really fucked up and I just need you to come home. Come home now. I will see you when you get here. - Hold on, no, no, no, babe. (dark, tense music) - [Mysterious Voice] Amber. (dark, tense music) - What do you want from us? - I want what belongs to me. - What are you talking about? - Serena stole from me. Something precious and infinitely malignant. Return it to me, and balance will be restored. - Look, whatever is going on between you and Serena, I want no part of it. - A stone figurine, an idol of a demon. You've seen it. - This is crazy. Get away from me or I'm calling the cops! - Only you can save the world from eternal darkness. Seize the idol, and bring it to me. I'll reward you well. - Wait! Tell me what the actual fuck is going on here. - The less you know, the stronger you will be. Your friend Serena is possessed by a demon. - A demon? - Lay salt across your thresholds. An unbroken line of salt will hold it at bay. Now, bring the idol to me as quick as you can. And I swear to you, all will be forgiven. (dramatic music) (door creaks) (dark, tense music) - What did you tell her? - Nothing, I swear. - You dare betray me? - No, Serena! (Serena growls) (Elias groans) (elevator whirs) (tense music) (Serena growls) (dark, tense music) (elevator whirs) - What's going on? (tense music) Are you okay? Amber. Hey, talk to me. (salt crunches) (dramatic music) (tense music) Amber, what is wrong? (Amber whimpers) Open the door. - [Amber] Stay away from me! Help, somebody, help! (tense music) - Open the door, you fucking bitch! (dark, tense music) - Get out of my house! I know what you are! (tense, exciting music) (Serena gibbers) (tense, exciting music) (phone rings) - [Ben Voiceover] Hey, it's Ben, hit me. - Ben, Ben, it's me, please, please, call me, please! - You fucking cunt. Return what you stole from me or I'll rip the child from your womb and stuff it down your throat! - [Operator Voiceover] 911, what's your emergency? - [Serena] No one can help you. Give me the idol or suffer. (tense music) (Serena chanting in strange language) (Serena shouting in strange language) (discordant music) (Serena chanting) (Amber screams) (elevator whirs) (Serena pants) - What the fuck? Amber? Babe, are you in here? Amber! (tense music) Serena, where's Amber? - She's in her room, acting really strange. She locked the door and won't come out. - Oh, Jesus. Amber? What's going on, babe? (tense music) Amber, come on, open the door. - Ben? Ben, don't listen to her! Don't listen to her, she's a demon! - See what I mean? She's delusional. - Fuck you, Serena, you're a demon and you know it! - Amber, calm down. We're trying to help you. - Babe, chill out, okay? I'm gonna get the key. - No, Ben, no, no, no, no, no! No, please, please, don't, Ben, please! (tense music) (dramatic music) (Ben gasps) - We need to calm her down. We can't take her to the hospital like this. (tense, dark music) - Amber, babe, I'm gonna unlock the door. - No, no, Ben, call the police, call a priest! She's a demon! (lock rattles) - Amber, relax, man. I'm gonna help you. (door creaks) (dramatic music) - Ben, get in quick, quick, but don't mess up the salt. - What? Come on, Amber, this is crazy! Come on, babe, let's call an ambulance. (tense music) - She wants to hurt our baby. - It's not your baby, it's my baby. (Amber gasps) My egg, your seed, Amber's womb. - Ben! (Serena screeches) No, no, no, no, no! (Ben shouts) (salt crunches) (Serena gibbers) (tense music) (Serena screeches) - [Serena] This is the blade for the sacrifice and (indistinct) our child. (Serena gibbers) - Take it, take it, just leave us alone! (Serena gibbers) (tense music) (knife thunks) (Serena whimpers) (black mist whooshes) (dark music) (Serena gasps) - Amber, what the fuck, what the fuck, man? (Amber wheezes) (dark music) Oh my God, she's dead, man. - Calm yourself. Celebrate the sacrificial lamb. - What are you talking about? We've have to call the cops. - No! No. - We have a dead body in our bedroom. We're fucked, man. - I'll take care of it. (dark music) - Amber, what's wrong with you? (dark music) Amber, what the fuck! Amber. Amber, what the fuck! Oh my God, no! (Serena's body crunches) (Amber growls) Don't do that, Amber! Amber, what the fuck? - We're having a baby, Ben. I'm feeding for two. (dark music) (Serena's body crunches) (dark, eerie music) (Serena gibbers) (stamp pounds) (dark, eerie music) (dark, eerie music continues)
