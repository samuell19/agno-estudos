Earth was so pretty back then. Give Dad a kiss. One more. When I told my daughter how beautiful Earth used to be, she didn't say a thing. Because what she saw wasn't the same world anymore. In the past century, technology has been developing rapidly, brought about by men's continuous battles to reign supreme on Earth. Since the development of military robots, wars have been skyrocketing all over. I thought after the battle two years ago, people would learn their lesson, and return to a harmonious world. But I didn't expect that this became the time for mankind to pay the price. Natural disasters, industrial overdevelopment, and nonstop wars made the global ecology worse and worse. Diseases and famine shroud the world. The air is now filled with high levels of toxins, causing many children to be born with severe illnesses, including my own daughter, Sissy. To restore the environment so mankind can get back on track, governments around the world started building Skynets that could purify the toxic air. But while the Skynets were being built, a giant meteorite fell onto B16. And out of it, a giant alien plant began to emerge. This plant thrives when in contact with water, wreaking serious havoc. The irony is that it can actually purify the whole atmosphere. Scientists have named it Pandora. The result Pandora will bring to mankind remains to be seen. But as a friend once said, "We write the ending of our own stories." B16 TEMPORARY COMMAND CENTER Slacking off again? Just breathing in some fresh air. Breathe while you still can. HQ sent over an entire robot unit. It seems like we're in big trouble this time. It's big, all right. But it's gonna be a big win for us. Scared? Scared? You fly the jet, I'll take the Command Center. Sure! I'll fight, you'll attend meetings. Ouch! You'll fight? Then we're doomed! Let me do the suicide missions. I want to see my daughter sooner. Sure. So Sissy can call her father useless. Say what? Besides, if I die, what would you do? You're sick of seeing me all the time? Well, I'm used to it already! Do I have a choice? Oh, really? The broad is here. Let's go. Commander Johnson Cheng of B16. Take me to the Major General. Timora and Enigma? I thought HQ already decided not to use robots. Robots are often more reliable than people. You have a gun. You rely on it in combat, right? People wield guns. Do you trust guns or people? I trust robots more. People can make mistakes. Lucy. It's hard to repair this watch. I'll teach you how to, just in case I don't... Look at those lovers. They're always like that. Don't you plan on coming back? Of course I want to come back. But you know how missions can be. It's hard to say. Nobody's forcing you to go. It's the Air Combat Unit. Why? Do you want to be Commander-in-Chief? Colonel Tam. According to scientific research, Pandora's growth rate is proportional to the amount of rainfall. According to the weather forecast, B16 will experience two rainstorms. The first one won't have more than 10 mm of rain, but it will cover 2 km of the area. The second one, though, will exceed 150 mm of rain, covering the entire B16, affecting its 5.6-million population. That's why the operation must succeed before the second storm. HQ plans to exterminate it? Not to exterminate, but to alter it. This is Dr. Chan Chung Chong, director of the scientific research institute that developed the gene bullets. He will explain in detail the plan to alter Pandora. Based on our current findings, Pandora absorbs pollutants, then releases harmless hydrogen. If we can reduce its destructiveness, there may still be hope for mankind. Lab number 9 in F9 had a breakthrough discovery four days ago. Pandora's cells had an obvious reaction to a rare virus called P7N9. The virus triggered its self-defense mechanism, dropping its temperature to negative 30 degrees, then entered a state of hibernation. Inside this gene bullet is the P7N9. If we can release the virus inside Pandora's pistil, we can stop it from growing. Have you made an assessment about the success rate of this mission? To increase our success rate, HQ has dispatched the robot unit to execute it. As long as one gene bullet can enter the pistil, our mission will be accomplished. Major General, if this mission succeeds, Pandora can be used to purify the atmosphere. Purify the atmosphere? So we'll stop building the Skynets? Do you have any idea how much time and effort I put into building the Skynets? Major General. I think HQ has told you about the importance of this mission. I hope the Air Combat Unit will provide assistance. What if this mission fails? Do you have a backup plan? We have a plan B. We will send out Orca bombers to destroy Pandora before the second rainstorm. Bombing range will be 14 km. Within estimated 160,000 casualties. What about evac plans? No evacuation plans? If Pandora is not altered before the second storm, all 5.6 million people in B16 will die. And do we ignore the 160,000? Aren't they people, too? Unnecessary panic will cost more lives. That's why this operation will be classified. Program input has been completed. That means the robots can now execute the mission inside B16. Commence operation. The Commander is here! We will be assisting HQ in finding Pandora's pistil in order to reprogram it. If this mission succeeds, Pandora will be disarmed, but will continue to purify the air. This is the Operation Chief from HQ, Colonel Tam Bing. The combat procedure has four stages. Stage one, ACU and mechanical units will await instructions at Central Building. Stage two, shoot contrast agent bombs during the first rainstorm. Stage three, once Pandora absorbs the contrast agent or CA, the Skyfish will begin scanning and start searching. Stage four, the CA will make its way to Pandora's pistil where they will converge. After the pistil has been located and before the second rainstorm, robots will put gene bullets in the pistil, which will alter Pandora. After the bomb drops, how long till Pandora reacts? Reaction can be immediate, or it could take a while. How long? Three minutes? Five minutes? What's the wait time for no response? Can we leave at once if there's none? How fast can Pandora absorb the contrast agent we fed if? This is an unprecedented operation. Our scientists still have to analyze Pandora's condition. You just need to follow the Command Center's order to the letter. Do you know the variables that - exist in every second of an operation? - Just follow the Command Center's order. - That's it. - You don't know, so I'll say it. We'll get turbulence flying low. Pandora will attack! Lives are on the line! Do we improvise? Do you know how many of us died three months ago? In every mission, there is always uncertainty. Only one thing is certain. Don't lose track of the CA's signal, because if you do, the mission fails. I don't care if I die, but I won't let my men die with me. I don't think this man's right for this mission. But he's the only one I trust. Then we'll use Plan B. There will be no Plan B for us. After Pandora appeared, the air improved. God is giving us this opportunity. The mission isn't just for us, but for everyone. There's only one plan to accomplish this mission. These are dark hours for the sky and the Earth, but not for our minds. Okay, men, let's go! Yes, sir! ACU is about to take off. Ground crew, please evacuate. - Be on alert. - Yes, sir! Paratroopers, ready. ACU, get ready for takeoff. All units, perform final inspections. Orca 086, ready. Command Center, ACU is ready, requesting clearance for takeoff. Air space is cleared for takeoff. Request granted. Copy. ACU is taking off. 086 calling Command Center. Current altitude 3,000 m. Distance from target area 24 km. Estimated contact with the target in six minutes. B16 TEMPORARY SETTLEMENT AREA Here. Over here! Hey! This is great stuff! Not the '78 remake, but the '56 original. This classic is impossible to find. Invasion of the Body Snatchers. HQ flew in two Orcas this morning. And three Skyfishes are escorting one Orca now. What are you? A military expert? What do you know, cyclops? Hey! You didn't pay me for the movie! SKYNET PROJECT A cumulonimbus at 2 o'clock, 15 km away. About to form a thunderstorm belt. Copy. Command Center, ACU is right on course. ACU's position 19 km from base. Distance from target 5 km. Estimated contact with target in one minute. Come on! Focus! Um. She didn't want you to go. She's worried about you. I know she's worried about me. But I'm a radioman, I also want to help. Wow! Tough guy! Mwah! Urgh. Want to make out first before we get off? ACU, maintain our strategic formation. - Copy. - Copy. Wind speed at target area Level 4. Air current intensified. Expect extreme weather. Attention, ACU! You're about to enter a strong convective rain belt. Make sure to maintain your course. Command Center, we have sighted rainfall. Growth reaction in Pandora detected. Command Center, we are approaching the target area. Attention, ACU! Entering preset position. Perform final inspection. Ready to launch CA bombs. Skyfish, start the scanner. Scanner is in order. 015, target locked. 046, target locked. Command Center, all Skyfish targets are locked. Pandora's begun absorbing water. Commence stage one. ACU, commence stage one. Ready to launch CA bombs. Five-second countdown. Five, four, three, two, one. Command Center, all six CA bombs have hit the target. Yeah! We've hit target number two! Yeah! Pandora has started absorption. Consistent with our forecast, Pandora will release the contrast agent as a gas, forming smoke. ACU, track the CA signal. Copy. We'll report the coordinates once the pistil is found. Attention, ACU. You've entered the rain cloud range. Airflow is extremely unstable. CA signal is moving downward at high speed. Everyone, follow me! Pandora is starting to attack! Stay alert! My right engine is on fire. Starting to stall. Descending quick! Mayday! Mayday! 046! 046! Skyfish 046 down. I'll keep tracking the CA signal. 015, I need back up! Copy! 015, let's go down at nine o'clock. Copy! Coming in, Command Center. Skyfish 015 down. Are you okay? 086's fuel tank is damaged. Fuel level is going down fast. Lincoln, Connor. Prepare to fire. Hold on tight. Command Center, confluence point is found. Location near Central 5th Street. Beginning the scan now. All three CA signals are back. I repeat, near Central 5th Street. Beginning the scan now. The pistil is below ground level. Commence stage 4. Drop the robots. Copy. Fixing device released. Paradrop released. Enigma ready. Timora ready. Signal interrupted! Signal interrupted! Try other channels. Reporting, Orca is off course. Orca is off course. Orca vanished off the radar. I believe it is crashed. Command Center, pistil scanning complete. I repeat, scanning complete. Do you read me? TARGET IS FOUND, TARGET IS LOCKED We're losing the signal. Low fuel! Low fuel! Brace for impact! - Daddy. - Hmm? You should go to work. Daddy. This will keep you safe. Whitie and I will wait for you to come back. Connor! Connor! Connor, wake up! Wake up! Look at me! Hang in there! Hey! Hey! Help me! Get the first aid kit! How bad are you hurt? Can you still go on? I think so. Give me the kit! Where is the kit? It's on the plane. Call Command Center. No signal. There's a hospital nearby. Let's see what we can find to stop his bleeding. Mobilize other troops to look for survivors. The mission failed. Time for plan B. Order Orca 2 to do a final inspection... The mission hasn't failed yet. We have three hours before the next storm. We just need to locate them first, then the mission goes on. But all the planes used in the operation... No signal only means we've lost contact. Even if they are still alive, if we cannot locate the pistil, our operation cannot proceed. All the water has converged. They're close to the pistil. - Who else can go now? - I'll go. With what? We have another Orca. You can't! If anything happens to this Orca, we can't execute plan B. Then I can drive a vehicle, or I can even go on foot. A hundred sixty thousand. There's still time. Just let me try! Plan B will be carried out as scheduled. You only have three hours. Why was the signal cut off? I've checked with the weather officer. A current of over 70,000 volts was found where Orca vanished on the radar. Probably a thunderstorm. A thunderstorm can't cause two planes to lose contact for over ten seconds. So don't speculate. I want answers. My boyfriend was on that plane. Then help me find the answer. Get an oxygen mask. Let him use it. You wear one, too. He's bleeding. Help me! We have to apply pressure. Press it! Harder! Look after him. I'll look for a hemostatic injection. Stay there. Don't let go! Like this! Keep it pressured. Turn the GPS on. Wear your headphones. HOSPITAL LOBBY, TRIAGE STATION, LIFT This seems out of place here. Hey! It's much better here. Something happened to the ACU, huh? So you want me back? After the mission, you can keep the truck. Just the truck? Are you that cheap? Three years of water vouchers. I'll be risking my life. Food stamps for four years. I have them now. What else? You really think I'm cheap? Don't tell me... you've forgotten how to use it? Lieutenant Taron Yau! Um. Let's go! Hey! Skunk! How does the movie end? The ending is tragic. Humans were defeated. Aliens conquered them! Not worth watching! But not this ending. We're gonna decide on that. The seat is too damn high! What are you, a dwarf? We lost Skyfish 086 at 47th Street. Rescuing your friend? No. We're rescuing our friend. Okay, after we've rescued him, - tell him to apologize to me. - Just drive! B16 TEMPORARY SETTLEMENT AREA BORDER Go take a look. I'll be fine. Connor! Do you read me? Connor! Connor! Tyler, do you read me? Tyler? SEARCHING FOR SIGNAL Lincoln? Lincoln? TYLER, LINCOLN, CONNOR Command Center, we got signals from the 086 men. Location, Victoria Hospital. VICTORIA HOSPITAL, 2.2 KM - Obey orders, okay? - Got it! - All orders! - I heard you! Come on! Take this. I'm going back for Lincoln and Connor. Command Center, we discovered an unknown creature. JOHNSON CHENG Hey! Where's Lincoln? I'm asking you. Where's Lincoln? They killed him. Are you okay? How dare you even ask me that? Why did you drive off without permission? Do you know how many died because of you? I asked them all to come... That was not the first time! Sean Li, that cripple... Skynet is all he thinks about. The order today... a suicide mission. Can't you see that? Yes, but the Skynets' construction is important to the B16 region. So are... our lives. We'll die out there. If you're so afraid to die, you shouldn't be a soldier. The unit doesn't need you. Anything else? - And... - What else? Go to the armory, hand in your gun. Step back! Skunk, find us a way out. Got it! Listen up. Go straight. When you reach the end, turn right. Just wait for me. I'm gonna make you a way out of there. That's it. Go in. I'm out of ammo. The air vent! Which air vent? What's going on? Hasn't HQ conducted a full assessment? Carry out plan B now. Major General, the mission hasn't failed yet. Shut up! You can't justify it anymore. If you dare to disobey my order, I will have you dismissed. Any signal of the confluence point? Connor, send this... Connor! Send this to the Command Center. Command Center, we're about to transmit pistil scan. Copy. Transmit now. We have received the pistil scan from ACU. Send it over. Looks almost as we thought it would be. The mission is still on course, sir. We have two hours before the next rainstorm. We won't abort the mission. If we don't have enough time for plan B, you should know the consequences of this decision. Get out! Pistil's location confirmed. LUCY I told you not to go. But you didn't listen. You'd better hang in there. You haven't fixed my watch yet. Do you hear me? You cannot die. Let's go to where the transport plane crashed. We must find the gene bullets. - We're still going? We'll die! - Obéit! Even the transport plane crashed? Yes. You're sure the gene bullets are intact? Hey! Think this over! We'll lose our lives! Why did you take him? He almost blew us to pieces back there. Are you talking about me, huh? I'm doing my best here. But it doesn't mean you're doing great. Yeah! You're... awesome! The unit doesn't need you. Thirty years of brotherhood, man. You hit it hard. Of course it hurts. You're right! Thirty years! The pistil is located at Central 5th Street. Copy. If plan A does fail, HQ's Plan B will be to bomb Pandora. That's great, then! Problem solved! We'll build more Skynets. Explosion range is 14 km. There won't be time to evacuate! There is no evacuation plan. HQ estimates the casualty of... 160,000. We must finish this mission. 37.5 kHz. Signal of gene bullet box detected. It's still in the crash site. Command Center, we received the signal of the gene bullets. We're headed to the plane crash location right now. Over. Let's go. DRONE CAM 01, GENE BULLET BOX, FREQUENCY DETECTION FREQUENCY SEARCH, DISTANCE The building's seriously damaged. It might collapse at any time. LUCY I discovered something. This morning, you lost contact because military radio waves interfered with your signals. - Try to find the robot's head inside. - Connor. Connor! Okay! Let's move it! You stay behind. Watch the truck. Don't call me if things go wrong! LUCY Commander. Let me come, sir. Yeah, that's right! Or they'll think you're a loser. Please, don't leave! Stay with her! Keep her company. Um. Sorry, sir. Take it easy. Do you think I'm useless, sir? No. Every post has its purpose. That's why we are called a team. Don't go. When we went to the hospital to get medicine, Mom asked me to wait. She left but she never came back for me. Don't leave me, too. Your daughter's cancer cells have already spread. You'd better be prepared. We've done everything we can. I'm not gonna leave. I'm not gonna leave you again. What's your name? My name is Pansy. I'm Tyler. FREQUENCY SEARCH, DISTANCE Signal detected. Gene bullet box location found, 50 m above ground. I'll go take a look. There is something wrong with this injector. Hang in there! You really are playing this trick now? Without me, you're toast! This place will collapse soon. We leave now or else we die. This old thing is a useless piece of junk. Yeah. While there's still time, go and replace it. Why not replace me as well? Dream on! It's just you and me now. Don't you run out on me! There are two people outside. Yeah, a dummy and an imbecile. Perfect! Here we have a sourpuss and an old geezer. Screw you, man! The box is up there. It must be 20 m high. If we both go, we might not make it. Maybe the imbecile can help us? If he didn't agree to drive, you'd still be at the hospital. Be the big man here. Give him another chance. If you're so afraid to die, you shouldn't be a soldier. Stop! I see the gene bullet! A grenade pin? You lost contact because military radio waves interfered with your signals. Try to find the robot's head inside. Let me down. Hurry, Tyler. It's about to collapse. A little more. Tyler, hurry up. Connor, where are you? Connor's still down there! Tyler! Tyler! We're dead meat! Who says I'm afraid to die? Hurry up! It's collapsing! I'll do it! By the way, tell your friend I'm not here to rescue him. And not only did I do the job, I was so awesome. Just do it! Did I do an awesome job? Yes, you're amazing. You'll get a prize when we get out. Here's the prize. Move it! Command Center, we've found the gene bullet still intact. We're on our way to Pandora pistil now. What's that? Let's go. We've only got 30 minutes. Central 5th Street. Copy. What are you doing there? The robots were the ones who bombed down Orca. I found this grenade pin from one of the robots. This was planned. It wasn't an accident! Someone wants the mission to fail. Someone controlled the robots. Whoever it is, ordered the plane bombed. It must be that woman! She's the only one who can control the... Someone else can, Sean Li. Major General, if this mission succeeds, Pandora can be used to purify the atmosphere. So we'll stop building the Skynets? Do you have any idea how much time and effort I put into building the Skynets? There should be evidence of Li sending out the command in this robot's head. - Find it! - Yes, sir! FILE INFORMATION, COMMAND INPUT: 15:18, SEAN LI We found evidence that you sent the command to the robots. No use denying. You're busted! Really? Stop already. You can still turn back. The day I started building the Skynets, I already knew that I would devote myself to it. Even if it meant sacrificing you, or the lives of 160,000 people, I have no intention of turning back. Cut the crap. It's all for money, right? That's what you think? Money? The Skynet is me, I... I am the Skynet. Am I making myself clear? One Enigma, one Timora, and three robots. We'll talk if you survive. Who knows? Maybe we will. That's great! Why don't we begin? HQ won't receive any news from you anymore. Let us see if you can get past Timora and Enigma. Good luck. We've lost the vehicle's signal. Do you copy? ACU! - Any response? - None. We can't contact ACU. Colonel Tam, ma'am. We lost contact with ACU. We can't get any signal. Skunk, how long before we get there? About 15 minutes. Look after Pansy. - You're on. - Okay. Guys, it's here! Enigma! Your eight o'clock! Hold tight! TARGET LOCKED Right side! TARGET LOCKED MISSILE WARNING Skunk, where is it now? Pulse bomb, reload! Two more! Full load! On the right. Is Pansy okay? She's fine. Sit tight! Colonel! We can't contact ACU, ma'am! We don't know their current location. All right. Listen. If we fail to contact ACU in 30 minutes, I will commence plan B. Pick it up! Pick it up! Throw it away! Hurry! Throw it away! Okay. Pick it up! Come on! Pick it up! Throw it away! Low battery! Low battery! I'm running out of juice. MISSILE WARNING Hold on! Fasten your seat belts! We don't have much time. Take it! Come on! Jump! Get up. We don't have time. Keep going. Of course! What else? I won't let that Sean Li kill us! Rain belt shifting. Rainfall in 15 minutes. Initiate final inspection for Orca 2. Get ready to execute plan B. Yes, ma'am. TIMORA, COMMAND ACTIVATED We must find a way to contact HQ. Or else, they will go ahead with plan B. We're here. Stop! It took 14 seconds for Orca to lose contact and disappear. So I checked the communication log. I saw that we received a long military radio wave at the same time. The wave was sent by Timora. It intercepted all signals within 5 km. There're only two people here who can do that. Come on. Connor! Use this bomb. Make a hole into the pistil. Roger that. No. Make sure you finish the task. Yes, sir! You must hide. Find a place inside that bus. Okay? Go now. Don't worry. We'll all come back safely. Go now. Come on! Be a good girl! Come with me! Come on! Pansy is a tough one! Hey! That thing's coming. Let's lure it away. No. We'll exterminate it. I'll take down the signal jammer. We must stop HQ from executing plan B. Okay. The two of us will take it down! Action! ACU's signal is back. They've reached Central 5th Street. FILE INFORMATION, COMMAND INPUT: 15:18, SEAN LI I've already received the robot's action records. Cancel all robot commands immediately! Did you think you could get away with this? It will rain soon. Your plan B has already started. They have to beat Timora first. Even if they do that, they have to blast a hole and find the route towards the pistil. You had an hour to do that. But now, you only have ten minutes left. Low battery! Low battery! Skunk, have you dozed off? Out of the way! Timora, right? I'll beat the hell out of you! Run! Connor! Connor! Get out of there! Run! Don't be scared! I'm gonna be fine. Run! Hurry! Low battery! Low battery! SISSY Pansy! Don't go. I'm not gonna leave. I'm not gonna leave you again. Come on! Let's see who'll die first. SISSY We have to go on! Pandora is starting to grow. Orca is already hovering over Pandora's pistil. Come on! Do you really think I would die just like that? I told you there wouldn't be a plan B. We are the ACU team from B16. HQ, this is ACU. We're in position. Ready to enter the pistil. Suspend bombing operation! I repeat. Suspend bombing operation! Orca 2, copy. Risking our lives for 160,000 people. It's all worth it! Let's go all the way. Command Center. I have entered the pistil. So those bugs come from here. "The Skynet is me, I'm the Skynet"? Well, Sean Li. Go to hell! PANDORA Pandora... Pandora has stopped growing! Yes! A WEEK LATER Dr. Chan's successfully altered Pandora's genes. It's harmless now. It can even purify the atmosphere. Although Sissy wasn't able to see it, Pandora's arrival gave the Earth a chance to be reborn. We have to cherish this opportunity. Hey! Would you stop that? I keep cleaning here, you keep drawing there. Come on! Kids are like that. What are you doing? You think it's cool to sunbathe in a leather jacket? And look at that hairstyle! So what? What do you know, man? I'm wearing this while sunbathing, so I'd burn more fat. And I just follow Johnson Cheng's advice for the hair. He said that I looked better with short hair. Johnson was right again. We write the ending of our own stories. And he disappeared when it's time to wash the truck. Where did he go anyway? To a meeting at HQ. Do you think he's off shooting somewhere? Another meeting? And at HQ? Smells like trouble to me. It's big, all right. But it's gonna be a big win for us. We only have 72 hours this time. Our mission is to observe the source of the signal. Do not make any unnecessary contact. Just observe? No contact? You used to tell Sissy how beautiful Earth was from the Moon. Now, you have the chance to see it yourself.
