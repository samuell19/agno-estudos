The Milk of Human Kindness No, at my age I don't blow out candles. Yes, you're right. You're right. Alright. Can I talk to mother? Can I talk to mother? It's Christelle. Not home? Mummy? Mummy? Have you gone mad? Do you know where the baby was? Where are you now, Christelle? I'm with my mother. Yes. Look after her, Laurent. Start in the hallway. It's no use here. Ok, come on. Come on, it's over. It's over. Come on, it's over. Come on, go home. It's ok. It's been enough. We're going home. Can I talk to Christelle? But she just called me from your place. Oh? I must have misunderstood then. Ok, no, no problem. Yes, very well. She's sleeping. Great. Aren't you feeling well, Mrs. Renaud? I'll get your husband. Alright. Strange, we're neighbours and we don't know each other. Feeling any better? Ok. I'll call the doctor. You just gave birth. A girl or a boy? A girl. - Great. It's nothing. It's a reaction. That's normal. It's normal. Have a good cry. It relieves. Mrs. Renaud... I really have to go now. But, you know... stay here for a while. Take it easy. And then you leave. Just close the door behind you. Ok? - Yes. Everything will be alright. Good evening. Isn't Claire home? Have you been here long? Did you fall asleep? A beautiful name, Christelle. When I was young, I didn't like Claire. Rather nun-like. At the clear running fountain Sauntering by one day I found it so compelling I bathed without delay Your love long since overcame me Ever in my heart you'll stay Sir Nightingale, sang Hey! You have the heart a-ringing My own heart is a-crying Your love long since overcame me Ever in my heart you'll stay A pity we have no crisps. What did you call your daughter? Can I sleep here tonight? Claire, you're not going to keep her here, are you? She looks desperate. I can't send her away. Do you know her husband? My husband isn't worried. I told him I was at my mother's. You have to eat. You have to eat. We're going to make a bottle. It's time for a bottle. Aren't you tired? Oops, what time is it? Damn. I'll call you tomorrow. Christelle! Oh, it's you. Where's your sister? Are you two having a fight? - Where is she? Don't yell like that. Didn't she sleep here? - No. What's wrong? Why are you looking like that? Why did she say she was here? Wait! Don't walk away like that. Where are you going? Home. She'll be back by now. Shall I make some coffee? You look terrible. Why did she tell me that nonsense? Jesus, problems, problems. I dreamt of her. Does that mean anything? She was near the stairway. Like the Arabs when they're praying. She was trembling. I called her, but she didn't move. I was carrying a plastic bag. I opened it and there she was, in the bag, very small. Like a doll, her face all stiff. I called her. "Christelle, Christelle. " I slap her to make her come to her senses. I called, but to no avail. She was gone. It was too late. Your dream is giving me shivers. Laurent! I'm bringing the boys back. That's nice. I wanted to go get cigarettes. I'm wearing a patch, but... Do you still surf? There's rarely anybody there before 11. And you? We don't see you anymore. Well, the work... and I have successors. Make room for the young. Isn't the mother too tired? No, she's ok. Well, I'll be going. See you. Thanks. Are you ok? Is there anything I can do? I'm ok. Do you want to come over to have a bite to eat? No, I've got the baby. We don't want to intrude. You don't intrude. Jo would like it. Jean-Claude! Don't let it get too cold. Let's try again. R?mi... Do you know why American Indians are always cold? Because they were discovered by Columbus. I have to work at 3 o'clock, but the children can stay. Yes. We'll have a match. Right, R?mi? She's eating. - Really? Not much. A little bit. Who's that? Who's that? That's dad. Don't you want to help me look? You must think I'm Columbo. You have plenty of time. Right, I have time. I'm even working overtime. Don't ever say that I have time. What? Don't ever say I have time. Sorry. - It's ok. Where do you want to look for your wife? - I have no idea. At her work. She went to show the baby on Wednesday. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't have a better idea. At her work, nobody will say anything. At least, not before the girls are gone. Do you know her colleagues? No. Do you know all of Josiane's friends in the shop? You know them, of course. You know everything. Do you think she wouldn't leave you? That your marriage is better? That you know your wife. Say it. I can hear you think it. What a miracle. As if you'd always do better. With you, everything goes well. But what do you know? It was touching. You, Josiane, the children. Real family life. Except, they're my children. It was my family life. I made those children. Christelle called. She said her name and hung up. Could she be with somebody else? I don't think so. We were broke. We got through it together. She's great. I have 3 children with her. She can't have somebody else. Ok, the eldest came really quickly. C?dric, that was my stupidity. But the baby... We really wanted the baby. We wanted her, damn. We wanted her! Damn. What are we doing here? I don't know. Why do you need a reason for everything? No, it's ok. What are you doing? Do you know her friends? The girls she works with. - No. These people are here for Mrs. Renaud. We're a bit lost. - They asked me to accompany you. Is she expecting you? - Of course. It's been forever. Do you work here? I never saw you before. No, I'm unemployed. You haven't changed at all. Do you have children? You? - Twins, didn't you know? Nobody told me. What are you doing in the dark, darling? She looked at me and it was as if she was talking. She'll be hungry again in two hours, now that she's eating again. I'm relieved. Thank you. Everything will be ok now. Everything will be ok. The tide is turning. You think? - Yes. If you want, I'll keep her tonight. I'll have her in shape in no time. Are you coming? I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm suffocating. Mrs. Renaud? Did you watch TV all day? Mrs. Renaud, we have to talk. What's that milk doing here? For the baby. I see. Mrs. Renaud, you have to go home. And you have to see a doctor. And your baby? What's the name of your daughter? It's not that bad. I'm sure your husband's looking after her. You were exhausted and you slept. And you have a beautiful child. I saw her yesterday. - That's not true. That I saw her? - It's not true. It is true. Ok... Sorry. Sorry, I'm fed up. The milk keeps running. It keeps running. As if I was a cow. No, that's not it. A bit of... This will make you feel better. Here. There. Well, I'll leave you on your own. You can manage on your own. - No. Yes, you can. Here. I'll give you this and then I... I have to go to work. Shit. Shit. Damn. And her doctor? Renaud... Renaud... I don't have a Renaud. What have you gotten into now? She just had a baby. I think she's afraid of her husband. What do you mean, afraid? - Sometimes I hear screaming, G?rard. But I'm not sure if it comes from them. But... I won't bother you. Not at all, I'm happy to see you. Maybe it's just baby blues. Can't you come over? Is the dish washer broken? No, why? Who's speaking? Mummy? It's me. Say something. Come back. Where are you? Christelle, do you hear me? Tell me where you are, dear. I'll come and get you. Answer me. Say something. It gave me a migraine. I didn't take anything for two years. "In this world of dreams I grow onions. Loneliness. " Do you know haikus? Short Japanese poems in three verses. One, two, three. I like my kitchen better. It's beautiful. I had it repainted. Colours are definitely important. But I don't like my dining room. I don't like the furniture. I didn't want those old chairs. Laurent said yes. Sorry, but I'm not a garbage bin. The old chairs are his parents'. They're buying a lounge suite and we get their old chairs. I'm not a garbage bin. And I have to say "thank you" too. No way. I'm not a garbage bin. But I didn't say a thing. I accepted it all. And I said "thank you". Thank you, thank you. I have a friend who's a doctor. - Friend or lover? Some people never have enough. You should call things by their name. A woman's a doormat. Yes, a doormat. A woman's a doormat. A mop. The slit. The little slit... the twat. The snatch. My delivery took 16 hours. The midwife was terrible. I wanted another injection against the pain. And I was screaming at Laurent. "I want another injection, I want another injection. " But the midwife didn't want to wake up the anaesthetist. "We're not going to wake up the anaesthetist. He's asleep. Come on, inhale. " They're not home. Come and eat. Eat something. It'll make you feel better. They're not here. I'll call later. I'll call back later. Eat something now. He'll accept that my mother takes the baby with her. This is not a hotel. I know I can't stay here. But I can't handle the baby. I can't. Right from the start. I have to find a solution. I'm lucky. I have no problems with my husband. Not many couples can say that. I love my husband and my children. My work is rewarding. I'm appreciated at my work. My children are well-behaved. Except for the baby, everything's going well. But you can look after your little daughter. When I divorced, I also thought... I thought I couldn't look after my son. Nonsense. I had to do it. I had to do it. You're the best possible mother, end of story. Understood? She's your daughter. You're the best mother for her. There's no other mother. No, I don't agree. I think... I don't agree. There are many ways to say you don't agree. And it's not that hard. I'm tired. Eat something. What's her name? You didn't tell me her name yet. Her name is... You don't have to be afraid. It's difficult. Many mothers are afraid they can't do it. It's very difficult. Many mothers are scared. But you can do it, just like the others. And just like everybody else... you already did it. You already did it with your other children. Yes, but that wasn't the same. Yes, that's true. It's true. For my mother, my birth... was the most beautiful day of her life. She told me that. That's the baby's milk. You drank the baby's milk. See you tonight? - See you tonight. I'm busy. I'll be a bit later. Yes, see you then. - Have a nice day. I helped her. I think I helped her. Talking did her good. Of course. I recognised myself when I left G?rard, three years ago. It hurt. What am I going to do with you? Should I come over tonight? What? Is she still there? She's driving me crazy. She's been suffering ever since the baby was born. It's not going well. For instance... when Sabrina was born... how did she react then? Very well. She was a very good child. She slept well, ate well. Sabrina was the difficult one. You should analyse yourself, rather than her. You shouldn't smoke when you're pregnant. - I do what I want. Let it go, Sabrina. Forget it. When she calls, don't antagonise her. Reassure her. Ask her what's wrong. It's true... She called last week. Her voice sounded very strange. She said: "Are you alright? Are you alright? And mummy? How's mummy? How's mummy doing?" She seemed worried. - Why didn't you tell us? When was that? - On Friday. We were discussing the party for her birthday. She didn't want to come. "No, no, I'm tired. I'm tired. " It's not about you. It's not about you, Marthe. How are you going to cope with a baby? By that time, he'll find work. We have to stay in the area. Sabrina has to be with her mother. When we lived in Voiron, this caused problems. It's better now. We're no longer alone. My parents live 8 km away. I have to find work in the area. That's something we learnt. What if we took the car, Jean-Fran?ois? Yes, fine. Hey, Laurent? She must be with a friend. We're turning this into a huge drama. What do you mean, a friend? - Doesn't my sister have any friends? Yes, but I don't see the connection. That's what she wants. She has to be the centre of attention. She has to be the best. Even if she's not. She can't have a good cry in bed, like everybody else. No, she has to run away and we have to jump. Look how pale he gets. Ignore it, Laurent. Ever since I'm pregnant, she's been nasty to me. She called you. She didn't use to do that. Out of spite, because she's not the only one who has children. You're crazy. - Shut up, you. Don't talk to Sabrina like that. - I talk the way I want to. Not like that! - Screw you. Come on, guys. Sit down. Did you hear what she said? It's my fault. I can't keep my mouth shut. Not at all. - Sorry. Christelle's not like that. - Do you know what's she's like? I know my sister. - Stop it. She's bored with you. She could have found somebody better. You wore her down from the beginning. You drained her. That's the truth. You know, Laurent... There's always something. That's the problem with life. What do we want? We can make ends meet. Why are we making ourselves unhappy then? I agree with Chevalier. You know... You don't have to worry about life. I'm not distressed All the little worries will disappear Everything will be ok. Do you think I don't have enough courage? But I work. Ok, you can't be fighting all the time. You can't keep your principles and honour up 24 hours a day. They may think I'm a doormat and a brown-noser... but I work. I don't need to save any honour. There's no life without humiliation. Almost everything is based on that. I can't say no. To anybody. Not to my boss. Not to my wife. Only to my children. I'm tough with them. I'm tough with R?mi, very tough. I hate myself for it. For years... I couldn't make love to Marthe. Recently, I managed... to love her... to tolerate loving her... to tolerate being dependent on her. You see? Don't touch my mask. It's not yours. It was given to me. Let's fight. I'm a king cobra! Do you think you're the only one? I'm taking your mask! C?dric, R?mi! We're leaving. Hello. Christelle? Yes, she works here. She's on holiday, I think. What's she like? Christelle... She's somebody who... I've never seen her tired. She's a hard worker. Without her 2 children, she would have become manager. Tell me about her. - What's wrong? Please. Well, we don't socialise. What can I say? She really went for it before her holiday. She made the company paper. There was trouble with Devaux. There's a lot of fighting among the staff. But she's correct. She was able to calm him down. Who's Devaux? Is he in today? I don't see him. - Can you point him out? No, but... I have to see him. Point him out! - Let go of me. Jerk. Daddy, you're driving too fast. Good... Good. Yes... Good. Hello. Did you know I lived here? - Yes. It's beautiful here. Yes, it's not so bad. Is that your house? Do you want to see it? - Fine. Shall we? - Yes. I missed you. I didn't know. I missed you too. Can you feel what's happening? Mrs. Renaud! Mrs. Renaud... Listen, I'll be straight with you. Claire doesn't want you in the house any longer. There. Wait... wait. Get up. Keep your head back. She can't look after you. She's got her own life. Keep your head like this. She seems to be a strong woman... Wait. Keep an ice cube against it. Keep your head back. And your hand here. I told her that I'd send you away. Please... Come... come. Come, please. Come. Cooperate. Mrs. Renaud, please. No, Mrs. Renaud. You're being mean. Do you want me to call the police? I'm calling the police. Ok, I'm calling the police. Claire will be angry, but... I'm calling the police, you hear! I'm calling them. Ok, I'm calling them. I'll call them. I'll call them. It's my birthday today. What? - It's my birthday today. Ok, but so what? Ok, it's your birthday, but... Damn. You should celebrate with your husband and children. And that's it. Come on. Ok? Come on. Come on. Ok. Come on. Ok. Leave. Mrs. Re... Mrs. Renaud... That's enough. Go away. Why are you so early? It's my birthday today. And it's her birthday too. Happy birthday! All our best wishes May these flowers Bring you happiness May this year be sweet and light And at the end of the year May we be together again Blow out. Blow out. I'm going home. She pulled my leg. She was in the bath, but where is she? Mrs. Know-it-all! Liar! You lied to me! Where is she? Where is she? Now she's not talking anymore. Where is she? You didn't see her! Liar! Where is she? - Mrs. Renaud... Quiet now, quiet now. Why doesn't she answer? Quiet. - She was in the bath. She was in the bath. She was in the bath. Where is your son? Where is your son? Where is he? You're not talking anymore, are you? Now she keeps her big trap closed. That's enough. Why did she lie to me? Why did she lie? She's a dirty liar. Drink this. - I don't want to. I'm fed up with your pills. I'm not sick, you hear? I'm not sick! You're a liar! A liar! I'm not sick! Get lost! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! She hasn't seen her. Mummy... You have to come out, Christelle. I'm losing it too. And that doesn't help you. Stay here. I'll be right back. Thank you. Thank you. It's ok. It's ok. It doesn't hurt. There. She's asleep for 6 hours at least. How much do I owe you? Never mind. You shouldn't have to pay for this. You're a pain in the neck. You always know better. How are you these days? Fine. Are you seeing somebody? I'm seeing somebody. Is it going well? And you? I'm not seeing anybody and I'm not doing well. Shall we make some coffee? I don't know. Oh, look. There's whisky. We can't drink their whisky. And why not? It's 4 in the morning. I'll make Irish coffee. Do you know when I fell in love with you? In the disco? At the airport. - At the airport? Three years ago, I had to pick up G?rard from the airport. I saw V?ronique. She didn't see me. When you arrived, her whole face lit up. She stayed where she was. You walked towards her. You laughed. You looked happy, very happy. You two hugged and left together. She looked so happy when she saw you. And then G?rard arrived. And everything became grey. Do you understand? Aren't you cold? We used to come here when you were younger, remember? With the camper. That's not skimming. Shall I do one? - Yes. Do you want a flat one? Here. I don't know what to do, R?mi. She ate three times, last night. - Thank you. She has to go home. Wait, there's a bag. Here. Don't fall off the stairs. Are you ok? Yes. Where's Jean-Claude? He's already on the way. Go now, she'll get cold. Excuse me... Did you see Jean-Claude Luciani? No, I don't know where he is. He might still come. Are you his wife? His wife left him. I'm the secretary of the club. I don't know what was wrong with his wife. She wasn't able to keep anything. Nothing. Not even shoes or bags. Some people lose everything. And men... Especially this one. He must have a complicated character. Near Auxerre. On a small road. The middle of nowhere. In the car. I have another 200 km to go. I'm a friend of your neighbour. No, in a phone booth. - What are you doing here? I have to hang up. Somebody wants to make a call. Yes, I'll buy a mobile. I'll be home in an hour. Because I thought you were asleep. Yes, see you later. Yes, me too. Don't be embarrassed. I'm the... I'm a friend of your neighbour. My neighbour? We're friends of your wife. My wife? Where's my wife? - In her room. In your room. What's your name? What's that? A shirt. Where's my wife? - In her room. Where's my wife? - I don't know. And who's that? What's going on here? Where's my wife? - We never talked to each other. We're neighbours. Pleased to meet you. Sorry for coming in like this. Where's my wife? She's not in her room. That's not possible. She must be in her room. She must have left while we were asleep. I called a... - A doctor. A doctor that I know. She was supposed to sleep for 6 hours. We must have dozed off. I don't know, she must... She must have left while we were asleep. We don't know. - I don't know. I don't know where she is. R?mi, come and eat. Eat. We're not waiting any longer. We'll see when she comes. Go away. Are you crazy? - Leaving is the only thing she's good at. Stop it. Look who's there. Look who's there. Look. Sandrine. C?dric. R?mi. Laurent. prevod : tatily
