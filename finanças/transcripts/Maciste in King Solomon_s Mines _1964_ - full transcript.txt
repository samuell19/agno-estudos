MACISTE IN KING SOLOMON'S MINES In the heart of Africa, in ancient times... was a city called Zimba. It was protected by ramparts. A huge forest populated by all sorts of wild beasts... isolated from the rest of the world. The city was structured around a magnificent royal palace, which led underground to the legendary mines of King Solomon. But the king, Namar, in his wisdom, banned anyone from retrieving the treasures. A statue of Beth, the goddess of peace, obstructs the entry with its imposing mass. Such was Zimba... this day of the 20th anniversary of... the kingdom being peaceful and happy under Namar. On behalf of all your subjects, O Namar, | bow at your feet. Let your city mark the coming centuries, not for the immense treasures that fill it's bowels, but the only true wealth you grow: serenity of mind. Unhappiness of the world disappears forever and succumbed to the property, leaving our hearts pure and happy, filled with love of neighbor and gratitude for our gods. Everything else is just dust as the gold, a breath would wipe. There! Where do you hide yourself, Vasmant? I'm herel Samaral I'll catch you! - You never get me. - You'll see. You can not escape me. You caught me. Abukar, will you be very serious, for once? I'll try, but I guarantee you nothing. Why these songs? The people are happy, thank your father. 1 also want to thank him. It is impossible. Your father wants you to stay here. | never see anyone other than you and Abukar? No. One day you can do whatever you want. The day you become King of Zimba. The King of Zimba... | say that you, you and not Vasmant, will take your place on the throne. You'll be the king an empire built on gold. Wait till my return. Soon, we will Zimba. Soon, your name will change. 1 will call you Ghinar, the goddess of wealth. Weakling! You are all weaklings! Watch them crawl like earthworms. And remember: Fazira's men must be strong. They must be brave. As long as a woman can beat you, you will be unworthy of her army. Faziral We captured a foreigner. Who is it? Let's hear it. 1 am wary of strangers. He looks peaceful. Let it be, Fazira. Her decision is always safe. Where did you find him? At the edge of the forest. Are you, Fazira? Maybe. What do you want of her? To give her a third of my wealth. Fazira will listen. Come to my tent. | always dreamed access to the city. For years, | thought at the time where I'd finally raid on these treasures. Your dream has come true. So you agree? Hear me, stranger. Without my help and my men your chances of success melt like snow in the sun. 1 want half of the plunder. Okay, Fazira. Half the spoils. Belall At your command. Gather some men. Put fire to the camp. Destroy all that binds us the past. You hear? Do as | say. A new world awaits us. Zimbal We will build our empire over its wealth. Come on. Vasmant. My son! The temple is behind this gate. Let's be careful. Let's go. Over the Top! By all the gods, Riad, Stop! Get out! Why do you not order my men? Traitor! Curse you for eternity! Take the small one, quickly! Come with me. What's going on? Time Is short, Samara. You must flee. But where? You have to go through the jungle. 1 know, but you must try. Once on the other side, look for Maciste. Say him simply that Abukar needs his help. Come on. Hence, quickly. - Abukar... - You must go. You can not escape, Abukar. Come. Where is my son? |1 don't know, | swear. It's the truth. Hooray! The plan worked! We won! Riad! The city is in our hands. We won. Hooray! We won! Slowly, Vasmant, watch out. What are the names of these strange animals? Giraffes. - They dance? - They run. - Why? - They feel threatened. Look! It's funny, right? You're right, it's very funny, Come. Careful! Look. Look, Samara, they kiss. There are shields who walk by themselves! Is something wrong? Nothing, it's fine. - You must sleep. - I'm not sleepy. Come on, be nice. Vasmant, answer mel Vasmant, where are you? Come here! Do not go away. Do not be afraid. 1 caught you! Gotcha. Be nice. You play with me? No, stay there. You're so cute. Where are you? Have you hurt yourself? Did you hear that noise? The lion must have fallen into the trap. Stop! Come all! This is not a lion. If's a little white boy! It's witchcraft! Under a wild and cruel exterior, the Mel-Dong, residents in the forest around Zimba, were, in fact, a non-violent people of ancestral traditions. Divided into many tribes, they devoted themselves to hunting, allowing them to feed and demonstrate their great bravery and their uncommon strength. They compared themselves only to the more ferocious beasts, they hunted for months leaving the villages in the care of the women, gentle creatures, workers and submitted. He has been found, Take care of him. Okay. Come here, boy. You'll drink a little milk it will do you good. So it was good? Thank you. Come. You'll settle down there to sleep. We need you to rest. You're tired. The villages were not always as quiet and deserted. The Mel-Donga were accustomed when they returned home to celebrate the capture of their prey. Hours go by... as Vasma slept, the tribe of Bambara celebrate the Killing of a man-eating lion, who had tormented them for many months. Stop, we have a visitor. What do you want, Maciste? | want to see Bambara. Follow me. We have a guest. Let us honor him. Long life to you! What do you want? Your hospitality... for this woman who is ill. Abukar... Macistel Where art thou, Maciste? Abukar needs you. Quickly. Abukar needs his friend Maciste, he must be in danger. Look after her, 1 go to Zimba. May your gods protect you. Go ahead. Go. Come on! Faster. Leave him alone. Get up, lazy! Kill him. His corpse will accompany you until it rots... so you will remember the fate... to all those who disobey Riad's orders. Go, go! The nerve, good-for-nothing! To satisfy the insatiable thirst for gold of Fazira and Riad, they needed arms. Hundreds of men, whose only crime was to grieve the loss of the peaceful reign of Namar, were enslaved and forced to work in the mine. They rarely survived the inhuman efforts imposed upon them. But continually, newly captured victims in the forest... were brought back to Zimba... by the ruthless guards of the two usurpers. You will drink when [ tell you! Get to work! Go to the others! Dig! Where are they? The high plain of Lamec, across the forest. They were captured yesterday. This time, you bring back only old people and children. The amount of gold extracted needs to double... not the number of mouths to feed. Execute them all. | want some valiant men. A moment. If you touch one child, I'll rip out your eyes and tongue. You're weak, Riyadh. Your sentimentality weakens your heart and brain. If the son of Namar fled in the forest he may be among prisoners. As long as Vasmant lives, Thy kingdom is threatened. Do you want to exterminate all children of the earth? My son could be among them. Your son is dead. It is necessary for you to admit it. Kadar, have you reviewed the prisoners? Yes, your son is not among them. Listen, Riad. If you find Vasmant, Fazira would leave the small ones in peace. How? | do not even know his face. There is someone who knows how he looks. -Who? - Abukar. But of course... He should know. Even if | have to tear the skin from his body, until he talks. Speak, Abukar. Vasmant or is hidden? Answer! Wretch! Speak! Give me that whip. He is to be executed today. He will pay for his stubbornness. Maciste... Where are you? Stop! Will you talk, dog? Cowards! Where are you going? Stay there! Come back! Couragel Weaklings! Come with me! 1 had hoped to see you. And me, to find you so quickly. We must go. 1 owe you my life. Time Is short. Samara is the village of Bambara. Are you afraid of an unarmed man? Rush him! Summon the archers, quickly! Why do you delay, wretches? Launch your arrows, damn it! Hurry! Pass it to me. You're finished. Your strength will serve you any more. You're lost. Where do you hide yourself, Riad? You can approach him. Your Invincible enemy is helpless at my feet. And you, Maciste? Where is your famous courage and pride? You look like a puppy who lost his mom. Without the net, 1 would reduce your army to shreds! Take him! I's funny, Riad. | have long believed that the dresses, perfumes and ointments... were mere trivialities, insignificant. | was wrong. So far, your ambition is quite different. It happens that | start to feel like a woman again. I had forgotten that feeling many years ago. | prefer the warrior in the jungle. The sword suits you better than the mirror. As a woman, | should be upset. But since It is not a question of feelings in our agreement, I'll take your words as a compliment. This does not solve our problems. Do we have problems? Who? You forget Maciste. As long as this man is alive, we will not be safe. We will kill him, fear not. But his execution will be public. For this is to be a warning... to slaves and those who still believe in him. In this we agree, Fazira. 1 will do everything to offer you the most cruel and exciting show in your life. Slaves of Zimba, watch your invincible champion. This is the one on whom you bet all your hopes for freedom. His exceptional strength has not kept him from being captured. A wave of my hand, and a hundred arrows pass through him. But such a death would not give me any pleasure. 1 want you to attend the collapse of your myth. So that you can enjoy with me, minute by minute, the mortal agony of this infamous traitor. So that you all can tell your children: | saw the death of Maciste. " Let the show begin! Whip the horses! Beat them! Harder! Harder! Do not shoot, archers! | admire your strength, Maciste. 1 could order my archers to kill you. But a man of your merit deserves better than that. | am willing to listen to your requests. And if | find them acceptable, 1 will grant them. Maciste is to be released! Are you crazy? Wilt thou destroy Zimba? No, Riad. | have a better idea. Maciste as an ally. That is ridiculous. You can not convince him. That's what you think. I have not come to Zimba to celebrate. Hundreds of men toil in the mines. We will think of them when the time comes. All in good time. Riad does not seem willing to give. He carries no weight. His reign will not last. He should be tried for treason if you want my friendship. You dare ask a condition. What audacity! You're wrong. | have several conditions. The slaves must be freed immediately... and returned to their homes. Anything else? Yes, you will respect the laws of Namar: close the mines... and obstruct it's access once and for all. Do not you think you're exaggerating? You talk like a conqueror. You forget that it is | who saved your life. Should | throw myself at your feet? The idea is appealing. But I'm not asking much. There is a point on which we both agree. Riad. I hate him as much as you. 1 will deliver him, as you request. You will do what seems good for you. Once Riad Is eliminated, Zimba's throne is vacant. We both take it. You are delirious. No, Maciste. You and |, we will be invincible! No power on earth could defeat us! Think of the riches this land holds! Think of the glory! Our names will be crowned for centuries to come. So will our future. Thus and not otherwise. Don't delude thyself. This is your madness talking. Gold has gone to your head. Thou art blind. This is not the gold that | covet. Do not you understand? Keep your affectations. I'd rather die than live by your side! Very good. You won. 1 will obey. You're the first man to be able to bend to the will of Fazira. You deserve a reward. They are beautiful, are they not? These are rare flowers. Their perfume is divine. Your beauty is matched only by your cunning. But | will not be fooled. Tomorrow at dawn, thou shall deliver me Riad. Until then, you proceed... with the liberation of slaves. | will watch in person... so that everything goes well, at that time... Did | drink too much? 1 can no longer... Take him to the mine with other slaves. When he wakes up, he will be rung and incapable of rebelling. He will not even remember his name. Belall You have changed these days. Why? I'm sick of this life. | want to go back into the forest. I hate the intrigues of power. You willobey me, as usual, and you know it. You are mistaken, Fazira. Renounce this city, become again what | admire, And I'll remain loyal. Otherwise, | will leave. Thou shalt go nowhere Belal. Guards! And your life will change as early as tonight: You descend to the mine. Take him away. - Hey, you! - What do you want? This is the Bambara village? There is no longer any village, there is no longer anything. Listen, | search for a a white woman. Have you seen her? Bambara is dead. They killed it. Fazira's men... have taken all survivors. There remains only the dead. The valiant Mel-Donga had given their lives to defend the freedom of those who had sought refuge with them. But their sacrifice was in vain. Long lines of prisoners Zimba earns every day. Among these unfortunate was Vasmant. Faster. Forward! Gol Stop dawdling! Gol Come on, hurry up! Get to work! What have they done to Maciste? He could kill the guards easily. Instead, he extracts the gold for this horrible woman. Get to work and be silent! Come on, lift it! Together. Come on, the confidencel We can not, it's too heavy. Let's try again. Maciste, raise the statue. Stand back. Let Maciste try. Gently, carefull It must advance a little. Come on, all together! "elp us. It's the end. There really is no hope for us. Stop! Stay there, and not a word! It's me, Samara. Hast thou forgotten? You're wasting your time. He no longer recognizes anyone. But why? Only the gods and Fazira know. There is no way... We tried everything. It is hopeless. Welcome, Samara. What a joy to see you. Will you talk, yes or no? Where is the son of Namar? Where is Vasmant? Let me do it, I'll take care of her. If you persist in silence, if you oppose my will, 1 will pour on your skin a layer of molten gold. You'll be the first human statue in the City of Zimba. You have one night to make up your mind. Get to work, lazy! Still, like that. A little more here. Advance. Go, go! Hurry! Faster, you. Some nervel! Faster, go! Gol Do not dawdlel Gol Zeleal Zelea, do not you recognize me? May the gods bless you, Abukar. I hoped to see you again. Samara and Vasmant disappeared. | returned for them. 1 do not know what became of Vasmant. As for Samara, she is here, but... Speak, | implore you, Where is she? She Is to be executed tomorrow by order of Fazira. Why does Maciste not do anything? He lost all will. He is a machine serving Fazira and Riad. This woman has bewitched him! - Can you take me to him? - Okay. But it will not help. He is no longer a human being. Curse Fazira! There is good reason... to pray to the gods to come to the aid of Samara. It is useless. The sun will soon rise, and it will be too late. No, we must act, we must do something! There must be some way to pull him from this apathy. Remove the bracelet from his ankle, and it shall return as before. How do you know? Do what | say. No, not like that. You will never succeed, it would take at least one file. I'll find one. You still refuse to speak? Too bad for you. Can you go faster? Sorry, | am doing my best. It is not possible. | will not let Samara die. Abukar, stay there! They will kill you. Farewell, Zelea! Come back! Are you ready? Stop! Do not kill him! | want him alive. | found you at last, Abukar. You'll be able to take your place along side Samara. Zimba will have two golden statues instead of one. Bind him! Look. Where am I? Why am | here? What happened? May the gods bless you. Quick, do not waste time. The situation is critical. We need your help. Fazira has ordered Samara to be execution. Abukar flew to her rescue. Where are you going? Come with me. The slaves rebelled. Raise the alarm. They closed the gate! He succeeded! Hurry. Quickly. Do not waste time. Come on, fasterl When the structure collapses, they are trapped like rats. Go! That's it, like that. Everybody against the wall! Look out! Go quickly! Maciste is dead. Tell your guards they will be rewarded. We can continue. The exits are blocked. We're done. Stay calm and do not despair. Do you know where we are? Yes, it's the gallery that allowed us to go out of Zimba. From here you can reach the forest. And there, one can reach the temple, behind the statue of Beth. But it is impossible to move that mass. Accompany the men into the forest. Everybody over there! May the gods protect you. Goodbye, Maciste. You will be rewarded. Riad is good to loyal men. Return to your posts. Although Maciste is dead, keep your eyes open. - Well said. - Yes, Kadar. The statuel Look, she moves! The goddess is angry with us! Flee quickly! Where are you going? Stay, good for nothing! Let us go! Get him! Capture Macistel Pour the gold! Give me that. Attention Maciste! Back! My friends... Zimba needs a new leader. | suggest you appoint King... the subject most worthy and loyal to Namar, one who will restore justice to your city: my friend, Abukar, We had hidden it. Take it, you've earned it. Yes, you're right. There you are King. Really? I must insist. Stay with us, Maciste. It Is impossible, My mission here is complete. Zimba will welcome you, always, with open arms. 1 will not forget. Goodbye. Goodbye, Macistel
