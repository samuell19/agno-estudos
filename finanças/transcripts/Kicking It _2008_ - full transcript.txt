(bright music) (soft, bright music) (boxes rustling) - A ball can change your life. You may not have any of those things that most people take for granted, You may not have a home. You may not have a job. A ball can give you something you never thought possible. A ball can teach you teamwork. (hands clapping) A ball can teach you discipline. (ball thudding) We are trying to make our lives better, and every person here has a chance to make their lives better, all because of a ball. You have a chance to come all the way to Cape Town because of a ball. (players chanting) (clapping and chanting) - In 2001, a Scot and an Austrian had a mad idea, to give homeless men and women a chance to change through an international street soccer tournament. They'd been looking for a way to bring together homeless people from all around the world, and football was the way. Or soccer, as it's called in America. They realized that football's a sport that's played in nearly every neighborhood, on every continent around the globe. From war-torn Afghanistan, to the slums of Africa, to the streets and fields of Dublin, where even as a child, I spent of me years kicking a football around. So, they put the word on the street. And five years later, over 20,000 homeless people were getting together regularly to train hard. They were kicking drugs and alcohol, they were finding a new sense of community. They were also hoping to represent their country in the Fourth Annual Homeless World Cup in Cape Town in South Africa. 500 players, eight from each country, were chosen to play. And win or lose, promised to be the journey of a lifetime. (accordion music) (bottles clinking) (whistle blaring) (players shouting) - I wouldn't allow him to come to the house. He ended up on the streets. (lock clicking) - A bit worried, yeah. A bit worried. - [Margaret] He wasn't the same. - How's it goin', Tina? - He wasn't my child, I didn't feel he was my child. He was somebody else. It was frightening. I stopped watching television, I stopped listening to radio, because every time you heard that a person in Dublin was found dead, you fear it's your child. And I didn't see him for about two years. And then, he came back, wanting help. And he got help. - I know my Damien's going to do it. When I get a feeling, do you ever get a feeling? Well, when I get a feeling, it usually happens, and I just have a feeling for him, that he'll do it. (players shouting) - Easy. Push out on that, Dave, push out on that. - Point for you, and a point for you. (player cheering) - [Mick] Here, come here, and listen. (soft accordion music) (percussive music) Football means a lot here in our community. Football can transform a lot of lives. You never know, one day they can become the next Ronaldinho. (players shouting) (whistle blaring) I could not find anything to eat. (soft music) My lift just started when I started playing football. It encouraged me a lot to continue practicing hard, 'cause if this football can remove all the hardship that we are going through, I could be really, very happy. (brush scraping) - I have to work, 'cause it's my job. But the smell, (sighing) Football, football, football. Football makes me eat, drink, sleep. My future lies on South Africa now. My future lies in South Africa. (whistle blaring) (animals bleating) So, we'll have to do it by ourself. (whistle blaring) (upbeat music) (singing in a foreign language) (speaking in a foreign language) (tools thudding) (metal clanging) (animals bleating) (cheering and applauding) (whistle blaring) - [Man] Alex Mwambi. (applauding) (speaking in a foreign language) (applauding) that I still have a chance to play professional football. I think this will be my last time playing football. It will be very disappointing if I come from Cape Town as a failure. (soft music) (speaking in a foreign language) (whistle blaring) (hands clapping) (whistle blaring) (speaking in a foreign language) (shoes squeaking) - Jesus is 62 years old guy. In some ways, he's like the spirit, or the soul, of our team. (hands clapping) This is not an angel, is not a wonderful guy. He was a very bad guy a long time ago. (speaking in a foreign language) (jewelry clinking) (speaking in a foreign language) - The Spanish team is a mix of everything. Not the best players, but those that we believe that they can take advantage of this project. (players shouting) Jesus is like the Superman. He could have been a professional. (applauding and cheering) For two years, or something like that. (speaking in a foreign language) Each one of the guys, they can forget about their problems, and for at least one week, or 10 days, they could be someone, especially in South Africa. (speaking in a foreign language) (applauding) (soft music) (players shouting) - Are you from Philly, too? - Nope, Atlanta. - Atlanta, oh. - Yep, Atlanta. - You came north, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. - When I was staying at my father's I didn't feel comfortable in his house. Not at all. I was the main one gettin' the whoopin's, I was the main one gettin' the punishment. It started when I was a child, and I grew up, and it kept goin', and goin', and goin', and goin', until I got of age, you feel what I'm sayin'? (whistle blaring) (players shouting) (whistle blaring) When I would go to sleep, I kept one eye open, because I just didn't feel comfortable around him. That's how bad it was. Nobody didn't think I was gonna do right. Everybody prays and hopes that I go to jail, or I die, you know what I'm sayin'? They kept mentionin' it, basically, they was praisin' it. "You gonna be locked up. "Well, you'll be off my shoulder." Well, my dad told me I had to leave. They don't know family tradition. They really don't. You know what? From here on out, fuck them, and fuck the rest of them. Feel what I'm saying? Now, how I feel about them? Shit, they could die today, and I wouldn't care. What are you talkin' about? - [Man With Buns] You're too greedy, man. - That's how bad it is. That's how bad they scarred the heart. Can I get a bun? Been a while, man. Been a while. Where I could go sit somewhere and feel comfortable. - Craig's anger issues stem from his childhood ability. When he got out of the group home at 18, he exploded all the time. So, at 18, he's on the street. And he's tried to stay at a shelter, but his temper got him banned there. - You see how many police cars roll by? For nothin'. That's stupid. The police harass the homeless. If a homeless person don't have nowhere to sleep, where they gonna sleep at? If the shelter's filled up, they can't get in, where they gonna sleep at? You feel what I'm sayin'? So it's like, they do, it's like, you have prejudice and stereotype combination, you fee what I'm sayin'? - It's a hell of a spot to be in, to be homeless in the United States. People look at you like, "How could you be homeless here? "What's wrong with you?" But I know their struggles, and I can see deeper than that. - So, it seems that the best players, we agreed last night, are Craig, who's a young kid, he's new to you, right? And he just picked up, - He's been workin' with us for a long time. Like, I ended up getting in a discussion with him, because he's a discipline problem around the center. And he's like, "Well, do you have anything for me to do?" You know, this Brooklyn accent, "Got anything for me to do?" And I was like "Yeah, you can play on our soccer team," and he started playing, and it was really key. - [Man In Blue Shirt] Impulsive feel to it, like any minute, - He might snap, but that's what he's been working on. - [Man In Blue] Having anger, but just uncontrollably, might do anything at all. - Well, he came with a lot of frustration. He went from group home to group home. He lived in 13 different cities in 10 years. It's a big risk, but you know, he needs a chance, he's really trying. (players shouting) - Feel like a stray dog, you know? I am somebody, and I am worth something, but at the same time, I'm nobody. But then, as long as you sit around and not do nothin', negativity strikes the mind. (soft music) (hushing) - Okay, guys, just give us a minute for a second. Charlie's gonna name the squad that's going to travel to South Africa. Okay? - Is that now, sir? - He's doin' it now, yeah. Alright. - [Player] Good luck, everybody. - With hand on heart, I know I've picked who I think is the best people, the best squad, the best players, to represent us. - And this is in no particular order, so I'll just go straight ahead. Simon Canning. (applauding) David Phillips (applauding) Garret Clifford. (applauding) Damien Farrell. (soft music) - In my mind, Damien was a million miles away from participating in this one to where he was last year. I'm just over the moon, you know. Over the moon, I can't believe it. - [Announcer] On our own pitch, the Homeless World Cup team, representing Ireland at the Homeless World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, on the 21st of September, 2006. (applauding) The team members: Simon Canning, Damien Farrell. - Winning, to me, would mean that this time next year, that every one of these guys have moved onto a better life. - [Announcer] Cape Town to represent Ireland. I know they're going to do us all proud. Ladies and gentlemen, the Irish homeless team. Let's give them a final, resounding send-off, as they head off next month to Cape Town. (cheering and applauding) (wind blowing) (bright music) (propellors whirring) (speaking in a foreign language) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, President Thabo Mbeki and his entourage. Please stand. (cheering and applauding) (bright band music) (applauding and chanting in a foreign language) - USA, USA, USA. (chanting in a foreign language) (chanting in a foreign language) (speaking in a foreign language) (whistle blaring) (shoes scraping) (whistle blaring) (speaking in a foreign language) (somber music) (speaking in a foreign language) (whistle blaring) (speaking in a foreign language) (acoustic guitar music) (speaking in a foreign language) (chanting in a foreign language) - Welcome, welcome, welcome to sunny, sunny South Africa. Welcome, welcome, all of you wonderful people from different parts of the world. (applauding and cheering) And we want to say, we want to ensure, that everybody has a home. (applauding and cheering) - It is my honor to declare the Fourth Homeless World Cup open. (applauding and cheering) Live on, football. You get a lot people saying, "This is just a crazy idea." I don't really care what people think, 'cause my main objective here is the impact to change people's lives. That's why we do it. (players cheering) Homeless people, generally, are low self-confidence, low self-esteem, they're isolated, feeling lonely. When you put them into a team, - Kenya. - Kenya. - you start to build on it. And then, when they eventually get through to the Homeless World Cup, they can stand proud. And I think that what we're showing here is that sport, and football, in particular, can be used to tackle some of the most difficult problems in society. - [Announcer] Welcome to our first day here at the Homeless World Cup. Over the next seven days, - In American, homelessness is a crime. So, they gonna arrest you for bein' homeless. A homeless person's really stereotyped. When they walk in a store, they get watched. They get watched 24/7. Then, they can't even go, like, you all can sleep outside. We can't even sleep outside. We gotta walk around like we're zombies or somethin'. You feel what I'm sayin'? That's how it is. If you want to sleep in a park bench, they'll wake you up and tell you to get up. And if you make a fuss, they send you to jail. And that's my word. That's my word, they do that. That's what they do, you feel what I'm sayin'? - Man, chill, man. (laughing) - What, you can't stand up, too? - [Analyst] Next, on pitch two, USA vs. Burundi. - They are not more skilled than you, but they are a very physical team. So, we have to be prepared to be pushed and to be kicked. And what we do, we don't retaliate and we don't argue. We just get on with playing soccer. ("The Star-Spangled Banner") - [Analyst] This match: US, Burundi. (applauding and cheering) The US wasn't able to win any games in last year's competition. These games are two seven minute halves. The US strikes first, shot just wide. - Up, up, up, up and wide, up and wide. - [Analyst] Here are the Homeless Home Cup, matches are played on smaller, street soccer-type pitches. Each team is a four-a-side, meaning a goalkeeper, three field players. That's the American Craig Holley with a hard foul. - Yo boy, Craig. - [Analyst] Knocking a player down, and being cautioned by the referee. Gotta be a little bit less aggressive. - Gotta get back, check back. Check back. - [Analyst] Well-battled, there. Ball went off the boards. - Nice shot, nice shot. - [Analyst] Burundi shoots, scores. (cheering and applauding) Burundi has now built a five-nothing advantage. (whistle blaring) American player, in frustration, angrily smacks the ball of the boards, and that'll get him a blue card. He's gotta sit out two minutes. - That's messed up, look he hit me. - [Analyst] The Americans have to keep their composure if they're going to succeed in this tournament. Nice ball-work on the sideline by the American. (applauding) Oh, he loses the ball in traffic. (groaning) (whistle blaring) Now the referee throws a red card. It's a ejection for the American player. So, they'll now be a man down. - They give me a red card? - You're yellin' at us. - I'm pressing. - [Analyst] Off of the goal kick here. (ball thudding) Brilliant interception by Burundi, and a shot and it's immediately back in the American goal. That's gotta hurt the morale of the team, right there before the end. (whistle blaring) Burundi, six-zero victors over the Americans. - [Analyst] Congratulations, Burundi. Let's hear it for both teams. It's now up to you guys. Do you wanna fight and argue with each other, with us, with other teams, then we won't win a trophy. And we came here to play some good soccer, and try and be as successful as we can. - These guys, the word they use for it is surviving back home. Like, "We're adapted to survive," and they are. You're sleeping alone on the street, you have to be very upfront, in-your-face, claim-your-own-space persona, and that is a fighting edge that shows up on the court. Now, that's a good thing, 'cause ultimately, by protecting themselves, they isolate themselves. - Being homeless, you do what you know. That's all I can say, do what you know. I know many things, but I'm not at liberty to discuss that with everybody. - [Analyst] This matchup: Kenya and Nigeria. Two first-time teams in the Homeless World Cup. (chanting in a foreign language) - [Analyst] This match marks the return of the Kenyan coach, Sigi, who in 2003 coached the winning Austrian team to the title. One of the key players for the Kenyans, their captain, Alex Mwambi. Kenya, Nigeria. Chance by Nigeria, saved by the Kenyan keeper. (applauding) Goalkeepers very critical here on the small courts here at the Homeless World Cup. Battling for the ball on the corner, (fan shouting) Referee has awarded a penalty kick. Alex Mwambi steps up to take it. - [Analyst] Mwambi, ready. Takes a shot, and a save. - I don't understand it. - [Analyst] Mwambi couldn't put it away. (whistle blaring) - [Announcer] It's halftime. - [Analyst] 50 million television sets are gonna be watching this Homeless World Cup live here in Africa. Mwambi, right back in the middle of the action, there, trying to dig out a steal. The Nigerian team coming out, shot, and a goal. That's a quick lead for Nigeria, one-zero. Kenyan team, playing out of the back, ball quickly forward, now it's Mwambi, shoots, scores, the equalizer. It's now level, one-one, Kenya, Nigeria. (chanting in a foreign language) Closing minutes here, game winding down. Good tackle, chance, saved by the keeper. The ball cleared away into the stands. (whistle blaring) And we finish two-two at the end of regulation, as we head to penalty kicks. Every match at the Homeless World Cup has a winner. And at the end of regulation, we go to the penalty kick tiebreakers, which are best of three. So, here we are. It's one to one, one penalty kick left for each team. Alex Mwambi, chance to redeem himself. He shoots, puts it away. (applauding and cheering) Kenya now with the lead. Their goalkeeper needs to make a save here to keep them alive. (hands clapping) Tiebreaker, last chance. (cheering) Goalkeeper, big save, and the Kenyan team wins on penalties. (applauding and cheering) Big win over Nigeria. (chanting in a foreign language) (bright music) (laughing) (speaking in a foreign language) So, we are very grateful for them, because we lack certain things, like toothpaste. We have lots of toothpaste. We don't have to complain about anything. Everything is perfect. The accommodation is great. We don't have any problem with the accommodation, 'cause even when we sleep in this open space, like in this hall, we don't have even mosquitoes here. So, we are very fine sleeping in this place. The food is delicious. We are not used to such food when we are in our country. So, we are treated like professional players. (soft music) (speaking in a foreign language) (upbeat dance music) (speaking in a foreign language) (speaking in a foreign language) - Thank you. So, we'll see you tomorrow? - Tomorrow, yeah. - [Announcer] Next game on will be Ireland versus Afghanistan. - Take the pressure off ya about winning, or whatever. - The best motivation is that you guys have worked your socks off for how long? Really, to actually get where you are. What I don't want see happen is that you get yourself caught up in all the hoo-haa, and whatever. And we forget about it, and we've gotta go out and play our normal game, and relax. (bright music) - [Analyst] It's Ireland versus Afghanistan. These teams feature two of the better goalkeepers in the tournament. (bell ringing) It's time to take the pitch. (player shouting in a foreign language) (soft music) (whistle blaring) (coach shouting) (whistle blaring) (soft music) I've been here about 1:00 or 2:00. Even sometimes earlier. Just get fed up walkin' around, you just come in here and get away from all the madness. You don't think you're worth anything, you have no respect for yourself. You can't hold your head up high anymore. 'Cause there you are, 6:00 in the morning, coming out of a bush after sleeping there the night before. That'll shatter any man. - [Analyst] Now, it's almost game time. At this tournament, top eight teams after three days of competition will qualify to play for the main trophy, the Homeless World Cup. The teams with the second best records will play for the second division Premier Cup. And the teams with the third best records will play for the Edinburgh Cup. Both Ireland and Afghanistan need a win here tonight to stay alive in the competition for the Homeless World Cup. And we're off. (applauding) An attack by Afghanistan, great save by the Irish keeper. - Damien, Damien! Brilliant, superb! - [Analyst] There's the challenge going out. Simon Canning, tripped by the Afghan goalkeeper. (players shouting) Irish team, they're on the counter, drop, save. Rebound, finished. (cheering and applauding) And the Irish forge ahead, two-zero. - That's you, Simon. - [Analyst] A nifty little turn. Fire. (whistle blaring) Goal, Afghanistan. (cheering and applauding) (shouting) Switch of the field, there. The Afghans steal in the middle. Back tap, Afghanistan, fake, shot, save. It's an end-to-end battle, Ireland up four-one. You can see, a physical challenge there. Both these teams are motivated. Referee gives a warning to both teams. That was a hard-fought first half, and Irish lead, four to two. There's a quick transition, shot, goal. (whistle blaring) The Afghans are fighting their way back into this. An attack by Afghanistan. - Hey, ref, come on. David, David. (applauding) (intense music) - [Analyst] Ball out. Oh, that's a terrible error by Damien Farrell. Gives it right to the Afghan player in front of him. And that cuts the Irish lead to four to three. Simon Canning, pass in the corner. A foot shot, goal. Two goal advantage here, final minutes. Five-three, Ireland, can they hold on? (intense music) Steal in the middle. Counter, Afghans. Ball across, save. Rebound, goal, Afghanistan. (applauding and cheering) (whistle blaring) And there's the referee's whistle. And it's over, the Irish team survives, five-four. (applauding and cheering) - [Announcer] What a fantastic game, ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for Ireland and Afghanistan. (applauding and cheering) (bright music) - [Reporter] Any nerves coming up? - [Group] Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, Ireland. (waves crashing) (acoustic guitar music) - We are having more fun than any others. I'm sure that we are having more fun than the winner of the tournament. Maybe, they will have one hour of glory. And I'm very happy for them, very happy. But we are having 100 hours of glory, of happiness. (laughing and clapping) (speaking in a foreign language) Of course, I would love to see one day, Spain win the Homeless World Cup. But at this time, the project that we have, the people we work with, and those that we choose are not thinking on winning. We wanna win in their lives. And, of course, we wanna try to win the next game. But if we don't, anyway, tomorrow, we are gonna spend some time at the beach. (acoustic guitar music) - [Announcer] The Spanish National Anthem. Spanish team, trying to keep up with Holland. Goal, Holland. (applauding and cheering) (speaking in a different language) We don't have team for winning. Sometimes, when the players, they are not doing so well, or they are losing, I see their faces, and they are not having so much fun. (speaking in a foreign language) So, that's the reason that I'm suffering, not because of the score. I don't care about the result. I care about them. (cheering and applauding) If they are not playing well, then they won't feel so well. Their lives are very bad, so I don't want anything else bad for them. That day when he fell down, people were laughing, and it's like, "Oh, look at the old guy." So, I felt so bad about him. - [Announcer] Let's hear it for Spain and Paraguay. (applauding) (speaking in a foreign language) He upset because he thinks that the rest of the players didn't make a big effort. But the truth is that they are completely nervous, completely out of the game. So, we are not doing the things that we were training. Some people can do it, some people cannot. So, what can we do about that? Just wait for the next match. (accordion music) (speaking in a foreign language) (train car rattling) (speaking in a foreign language) (whistle blaring) (speaking in a foreign language) - So, like many, many young guys from far regions of Russia, he thought about changing his life. (speaking in a foreign language) (soft, somber music) (speaking in a foreign language) I have 11 years experience of homelessness. I am illegal inhabitant of St. Petersburg. I have no registration at all. There are more than 50,000 homeless people in St. Petersburg. So now, they are illegal inhabitants of St. Petersburg. (door creaking) (speaking in a foreign language) Finally, after a year, they have, of being homeless, not only illegal inhabitant, he had no roof under his head. So, he closed his eyes and his love to football that he would change his life. - [Announcer] It's Russia in the blue shirts, and England in the red. Two very tough teams. (players shouting) (cheering and applauding) and he has no right to be winner. He must be loser. A part of your life. - [Announcer] Let's hear it for both teams. - You must win. (soft music) (speaking in a foreign language) (laughing) (horns honking) - As a player, if you are mad at the referee, it'll hurt you if he calls fouls against you. Leave that to us, you take care of your job. You job is to keep your head and hustle. - [Analyst] It's USA, Australia. Can the US redeem itself? They have yet to win a game here in the tournament. A shot to the far post, it's in the net. (applauding and cheering) Craig Holley there, knocking the Australian player off the ball. And he gets a lecture from the referee. Again, they've discipline problems here for the United States. Off of the goal kick here, interception right there. Picked off. Spotted, scored. US now leads three-one. The Aussies attack. Save, but a penalty is called. The US goalkeeper went outside the restraining circle. (players shouting) The American, Holley, is protesting. He's gonna get a blue card. Further dissent earns him a red card, and he's gonna be ejected. And the US are now a man down. - [Lawrence] The guy gave him a blue card. Grabbed the blue card out of the referee's hand, so he got a red card. Completely unacceptable lack of respect for authority. Referee's like the weather, you just have to accept it. - [Craig] Yeah, I kinda said, "Fuck the blue card." - You're gonna sit on the bench. - [Craig] 'Cause I was so angry, and didn't care about it no more. (sad music) I care about everybody. And when you cross that line where I can't deal with you, then I can't deal with you. - [Analyst] Play resumes. There's a rim shot to the far post. (whistle blaring) And that's it. Big win for the United States. - [Announcer] That's the first win for the US. - Congratulations, coach. First World Cup win. Wow, our guys have come here and really struggled, like, all their issues have come up. You know, I wish they hadn't. - Hit the game runnin'. We cannot afford to wait. We need to dictate the pace, not them. Whatever you do is the right thing. No one will ever say anything to ya. Right? Okay, so we need you to relax, cool down. Now what we gotta do is, we've got a group now, get it, Liberia, we've got to now beat Liberia. - Eddie, Eddie. Go with him, go with him, go with him. - You're okay. You know, you said it. - [Analyst] It's Ireland versus Liberia. The Irish need this one to stay alive, and they're playing without their star goalkeeper, Damien Farrell. We're not sure why he's not available today, but he's not in the nets. The Liberians are quick. Shot, score. (cheering and applauding) (whistle blaring) Referee with a drop-ball restart, the Liberians pounce, goal. - Hey, no way, no way! Michael! (intense music) (cheering and applauding) Tough, tough loss for the Irish. They went in here down one of their critical players, and they just weren't able to put it together. - [Announcer] Final score: Liberia six, Ireland nil. - Fuck off with that camera, ya prick. - Hey, hey, keep it off. (speaking in a foreign language) - [Najib] Oh, she looks nice. - I cannot fail in South Africa. When we go home, people will be expecting that we've come with something. So, if we don't get scouted, if we don't win the cup, it will be very disappointed in our lives. - [Analyst] Alright, it's Kenya and Namibia, and there's Alex Mwambi, captain of the Kenyan team. Kenya needs to win to remain eligible for the first prize, World Cup. Shot by Kenya, and the Namibians dodge a bullet. Kenya on the attack. (applauding and cheering) (whistle blaring) There's a penalty kick awarded to Kenya. Goalies can't come out past that goalie circle. - [Analyst] This is Alex Mwambi, taking the approach. Misses the penalty. (whistle blaring) That's halftime. - The coach is very angry with me, but I can show him that I'm able to score penalties. This is a must-win game now. - [Analyst] Alex Mwambi, the little shake and bake. Ball on the way, shot just wide. (applauding) Quick action, end-to-end, up and down. Shot just missed. Oh, the goalkeeper tumbles outside of his circle. That's a penalty kick for Kenya again. - [Alex] I just knew that when I take the second penalty, I'll correct the mistake from the first penalty, and this time, I'll be able to score it. - [Analyst] It's Alex Mwambi again. (ball thudding) Misses. (whistle blaring) Tough time for Mwambi. You know he wants to win so badly. He's gotta be hurting after that. His coach is pulling him off. Kenya, back on the attack. There's the refs whistle, zero-zero at the end of regulation, and we're going to penalty kicks. Here we are, after two penalty kicks apiece, and it's all level. Alex Mwambi watching from the sidelines. Here's Kenya's last kick. They need this to have a chance. (net clinking) (cheering and applauding) Kenya, up by one. Namibia needs to score this penalty kick to stay in. The Irish boys are cheering on their Kenyan friends. (applauding) Namibia at the spot. Everyone's ready. Shot, save. (applauding and cheering) (bright music) - Are you proud? - I am very proud. - I just want to apologize to my coach. Yeah, I lost two penalties, and he say that I'll not play again. (sad music) (engines humming) - This isn't how Africa is supposed to be, man. You're supposed to see everybody happy, in peace, loving, kind. I see love and kindness, but there's some people here that just not happy. Some people here are homeless. Some people here are just plain out depressed because of the way society has treated them. Made me thing, "Never take nothin' for granted." (hammer clanking) Alright, I'm about to find me some gloves. I'm about to go do this. Any extra gloves? (hammer clanking) - Over, yeah. That side, that side. (bright music) (laughing) - Aw man. (laughing) I had it, I had it. See that, Lawrence? That's my brother, that's my brother, and this is my brother. I just want a family, that's it. I just want a real, true family. You feel what I'm sayin'? What's the point of them being my family from the beginning if they just didn't care? That's my brother. I have nobody on my side. That's what I'm sayin', nobody wasn't on my side. - Yeah, hey, my brother, how are you? - Doin' okay. - Cool. - What was that little voice in the back of my head? It said, "What about me, Craig?" (laughing) - [Analyst] Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're down to the final days of the tournament. Next match: Spain versus Austria.

I'm very, very happy for them. I'm very proud of them. 'Cause every night, we talk, we laugh, but at the same time, I think sometimes, we need to win, so they feel like they are winners. No, no, no, no, no, no. (sad music) (chanting in a foreign language) (clapping) - One minute, Coach, one minute for me. - [Sigi] No. (mellow acoustic music) (shouting) (clapping) (bright acoustic music) - [Announcer] Goal, Kenya.

We talked about what we need to do as a team. It was a great moment. And we all left that meeting saying, "Yeah, "we need to play more as a team to win." - Mmm, this is tender. And I said, "Fuck the blue card." But that's my mistake, and I would never say that again. - [Announcer] Good afternoon, it's the USA versus Norway. - [Analyst] Here we go for USA-Norway.

It's Craig Holley, a physical battle. He's pulled down. - When he fell, I helped him up. Because when I fell, he helped me. And I returned the favor.

He's played a great game. - Fantastic, fantastic. - [Craig] Everybody wants some type of limelight. And the limelight is not always the best light. - [Analyst] And that's full time. Americans win, six-two. - [Craig] The only way you can shine is when you improve yourself, and when your light inside of you shines. - [Lawrence] Every time we go out there, we have a chance to prove ourselves. We didn't do it the first games. We felt bad, we bickered with ourselves. In the face with all the bad behavior and the anger, I'm intensely proud of Craig and each and every one of our players. He's got some anger issues, and Craig Holley, that's been his big issue, and was able to overcome that. - Let's rub Dave's hair. - To me, as a coach looking on, that's great, that's progress. - [Team] One, two, three, USA.

(cheering) - [Player] It's ABC. - Never beat the Irish. This is the only way to exist. To win everything. Everything and everybody. And to become winners, we must realize the idea of working together as a team. The slogan of our team was "Shut up and play." Everybody from our team has problem in his life, has problems to solve.

Russians look a little frustrated. They can't seem to finish. Now, the Kazaks on the attack. Shot, saved by the keeper. (speaking in a foreign language) Russia plays the ball out.

Hope there's no stingrays. I mean, I' happy that I came, you feel what I'm sayin'? They tryin' to come out, look at 'em trying to eat. I guess I changed. Yo, right there. I changed my way of thinking. I'm about to go climb up on these rocks. (growling) I just got tired of gettin' mad. Just like I'm tired of cryin', for what? Hey, hey, don't come to my penguins.

More than one-third of the players found regular jobs, 93 players have successfully kicked drugs or alcohol, and nearly half had improved their housing situation. Most were continuing to play football, knowing from personal experience that something as simple as ball can change your life.
