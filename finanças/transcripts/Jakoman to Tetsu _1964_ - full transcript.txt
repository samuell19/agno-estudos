JAKOMAN AND TETSU SCREENPLAY: AKIRA KUROSAWA & SENKICHI TANIGUCHI BASED ON "HERRING FISHERY" BY KEIZO KAJINO STARRING KEN TAKAKURA TETSURŌ TAMBA HIZURU TAKACHIHO SHINJIRŌ EHARA WAKABA IRIE YŌKO MINAMIDA SHIRŌ OSAKA ISAO YAMAGATA DIRECTED BY KINJI FUKASAKU SHŌWA ERA, 1947 HOKKAIDO MARCH - HERRING FISHING SEASON ARRIVES AND MIGRANT FISHERMEN FLOCK TOGETHER FROM AKITA, FROM TSUGARU, FROM THE MOUNTAINS, AND FROM THE FIELDS. So many people! More this year than in previous years. What the hell? Boss! Boss! The fishermen are here! Welcome! It's going to be another hard year. The fishermen are here. And more of them are coming. Dealing in fish is a big gamble. It's an easy way to lose everything you have. Dad! Here's the seal stamp! Did you borrow the money? Yes, I borrowed the money. How much interest? I overheard that a fishing boat was robbed when it brought in its catch. So now he's in big trouble. I asked you how much interest! He was very preoccupied with the whole thing. I saw that he was busy so I didn't ask too many questions. You lazy bum! Okay, okay, that's enough chopping. Forget about the chopping, just start preparing the meals. You can't imagine how much food a fisherman can eat. This dump is pretty grim. The newspaper said the housing is good. This dilapidated shack is a hazard! It's your first time herring fishing, isn't it? That's right. I'm a complete beginner. I would appreciate some tips. It's weird, though... An Osaka accent is out of place in a herring fishery. Right. Another newcomer? What is going on? Don't ask so many questions. It's enough that cops are doing background checks on us migrant workers! Have you gathered enough fishermen? Well, I... Don't make me ask again! I have to do everything myself around here! How many people did you bring in? Oh. About ten. All right. We'll be back to work tomorrow. We'll clear the slate and start fresh. There are a lot of migrant workers and ex-convicts here... Then use that to negotiate a better price! Why are you so worried about the police? If you get caught, you'll lose your land and everything. How could you say that about your father? After all, I am Kyubei of Hokkaido! Even if I get a conviction, so what? Masa! You're going overboard with all that rice! How long are you going to keep talking to the dead? It won't bring him back. I don't believe that Tetsu is dead at all. He was so good at swimming. He couldn't have died at sea. You're talking nonsense again. The whole ship sank. Everybody's giving me trouble. I told you that you're out of place here. This is not an easy job. I'm fine. I had a dream last night so I didn't sleep well. A dream? I could still see it when I woke up. I dreamed I was a kid again getting a shot from the doctor. Okay, let's go. Who is that guy? Hey, he's just sitting there motionless like a Buddha! - He can't move. - Why not? Because of greed. Just look at him. You st-st-stepped on my net! My net! Uncle? Uncle, is your name Kyubei? I'm Kyubei. What do you need? I don't need anything from you. Someone's come from Sakhalin looking for you. What? Who is it? Who is it? I don't know his real name, but... ...everyone calls him "Jakoman". Huh? Jakoman? Out of the way! Masa! Masa! This guy! Still sitting here eating even after the meal is over! You act like we won't ever feed you again! Useless bum! Get out of here! Get up! What's wrong? Have you...seen Jakoman around? Don't talk nonsense. Didn't you say Jakoman was dead? Yeah, but I heard some talk. Talk? What talk? It's not about you taking his boat, is it? Shut up! That was all at Sakhalin. There was no other option. My boat was wrecked. He shouldn't have been off alone sleeping. You can't blame me. Anyone would have taken that boat and left. That's true, but it's still his boat. What's the point of you bringing that up now? Jakoman is coming for us! What should we do, Dad? Soutaro! Soutaro! Why are you calling Soutaro? He doesn't know anything. Soutaro has to know something! What is it? Have you seen a tall, one-eyed man around here? A man like that? Yeah, I think I've seen him. Where? Oh, where was that...? I think he was one of the guys I hired to work for us today. Idiot! How could you hire someone without my permission? But Dad, we don't have enough people. Didn't you tell me to hire more people? None of them are in here now. They're all over at the beach... Jakoman, you're here? What are you doing here? You don't know why I'm here? I thought you were dead. That's why I borrowed your boat. Cut the crap! You only ever look out for yourself. You don't care if others live or die. I suffered so much when I nearly drowned. You can't imagine. Enough! Why are you so angry? Come down and let's clear this up! You don't have to put on such a show here! You won't be able to rest well until this is settled. Good point. Then let's find a good way to settle this. How much do you want? I'm not interested in money. Then what do you want? I want to see tears running down your face. - Tell me what this is about! - Quiet! I'll be staying here for the time being. Kyubei! Kyubei! Tetsu is still alive! I was praying and I received a sign that Tetsu is still alive! Masa! Get her out of here! Oh, excuse me... Aren't you our Jakoman? Ma'am... It's been a long time. So you survived, too? This is a truly happy day! Come down! Don't just stay up there! Come sit and have a cup of tea! What a lucky day! What's going on? Who's that jerk? What are you doing? Do you think that you're the only one here? That's where I sleep! G-g-g-g-g-get out of here! You bastard! Don't you run away! All right, all right! Stop it! No more fighting! No more fighting! D-d-d-don't mess with that maniac! We can't beat him ourselves. We need to find someone else to do it. Get the hell out of here! Get out of here! I told you to get out! If you don't, I'll kill you! Bastard! Where are you going? I'll give you a ride. All right. Thank you very much. Shimamui Coast, Kuma Village. Me too. Climb on up. Hiya! Hiya! Miss, do you know a man named Kyubei? Sure I do. Huh? You know Kyubei? Why is it so surprising that I know that old man? Hiya! So who are you going to see? Jakoman. Jakoman? Never heard such a name. "Jako" like the little fish. He's a difficult man to deal with. And you're looking for him? I haven't seen him in three years. Ha ha! You can't catch the little fish! You be quiet. I'll catch him, all right! Hiya! Hiya! Dad, you spend all day sitting here. The fishing season is almost over! Go find some other fishermen! Sitting here every day, not moving, just smoking and then smoking some more. No punishment for the crime hanging over your head. And now this house is in Jakoman's hands. Kyubei! Kyubei! Tetsu has come back! Shut up! It's true! Masa! Take her out of here! It's true! - Mom, what are you talking about? - It's true! I know how you feel. I know. I'm back. I'm not a ghost. I have legs. Tetsu! Mom is still such a crier! Tetsu! There's no reason to cry, Mom. Eh? Tetsu! Tetsu! Tetsu! This was all for me, huh? Silly thing. I don't think this is human food. It's obviously for the horses. Tetsu! Your mustache has really grown, Dad! Tetsu... Tetsu... Hey, look! Isn't that the boss? Come along if you want! Where are you going? How should I know? Wait and see what I do to him! Look! I still have the scar. Three years have passed since then. Be honest. Do you really hate me? I hate you! You like to pretend to hate me, right? I hate you! Tough talk! Hey guys, look at that woman! "I don't remember you anymore!" Ha ha ha ha! "I d-d-d-don't remember sleeping with you, either!" Ha ha ha ha! Hey! Hey, everyone! The fishery has decided to to hold a dinner party! Everyone thought the boss's son was dead. Who would have guessed that he'd come back alive? It doesn't look like it made any difference that his son is back. Look at the old man! He loves fish more than his own son, the greedy old man! Ha ha ha ha ha! Are you kidding me? KYUBEI DEEP-SEA FISHERY Great. Tetsu is back. Are you still saying that this fishery was supposed to be yours? What's wrong with that? As your husband, I'm the rightful heir to the old man. Still talking nonsense. Dad said that Tetsu comes first, then you. Why are you going on about it so much? Well I'm sure not going to fight him for it! Hey! Come on out, Soutaro! Soutaro! Play something for us! Yes, yes. Well? Go on, then. We've been waiting for this! All right, my turn. I'll do a dance. Join in, everyone! [shouting in Malay] Come on! Sing along!

You're lucky to have a good son! What are you still doing up there? Come join in the fun with us. Come on down. Don't be shy. Let's do some dancing. Is that all you got? Big brother... What's the one-eyed guy's name? Jakoman...Sir. Jakoman? Hey, did you lose your eye fighting with some female fish? Boy, what are you trying to do? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Tetsu! Testu! You don't want to start any trouble. I'm not, Mom. This man said he was going to sell me some fish. Isn't that right? Come on, then. This is gonna be a good show! It's gonna be all right, Dad. Tetsu... Tetsu... Don't mess around. I'm sorry, Jakoman. Don't bother with him. It's Tetsu's fault. What a fight! It's great, isn't it, Dad? This boy spent six years in high school and all he learned was how to be rowdy! Other than that, he's no good at anything! No good? Maybe not as good at growing a mustache like you. Watch your tongue! My, my, what a celebration. After tonight it's time to get back to fishing. If you don't cover up, you'll get cold. Taka! Taka! Yes? Isn't Tetsu here? Tetsu? Oh, Kyubei! What happened to your mustache? Tetsu? Where's Tetsu? Tetsu did that, right? Idiot! I'm his father and he dares to mess with me?! Did he cut it with scissors? I would have just let him do it. That boy really is incredible. The day the long-awaited south wind arrived, the nets were finally cast. It's great. Everyone's so full of energy. Yeah. Come on! Keep up! Don't fall behind! Look at your son. He's the same as you were when you were young. You're not that good! You're still young! Don't talk so big, Dad! I can't do any worse than you! What?! That one-eyed seadog is no pushover. You'll see. Oh, there you are. What are you doing here every day? Just checking in? Me, I work every day. I'm exhausted from fishing. Aren't you ashamed of yourself at all? Swindling the elderly... What do you mean, swindling? Just that. I mean you stole my father's boat and slipped off. Wait a minute... You were in the Philippines at the time, right? Huh? You got it all wrong. I wasn't the one who stole the boat. It was your father. What are you saying? I want to know who it was. Which one of you stole the boat? Just look at his face and you'll know. It was you, wasn't it, Dad? What did you say? Your face has given you away like a guilty child. A son shouldn't have to see his father's face like this. Quiet! I'm sorry. Come with me. How much do you want? I don't want money. What do you want, then? Have you ever regretted something so much that you've cried? I want to see Kyubei shedding tears. I won't be satisfied until I have seen that. It's true that my father wronged you... But an apology isn't going to be enough for you, is it? I didn't chase Kyubei all the way here just for an apology. Uh, what do you do to earn a living? If I tell you then I'll be out of work. I see... Sounds like you wouldn't even trust me to keep the secret. That's right. I'm warning you... If you really want to start trouble, I'm not going to just stand by. Very good. You're a dutiful son. Kyubei would be proud. Don't say anything bad about him. - Wait. - Huh? What are you doing, asshole? I'm gonna finish you off! You bastard! Wait! What is it? Today is Saturday. So what? What does Saturday have to do with fighting? We have to deliver on Sunday. If we don't get the job done today, we're finished. Bye. Did you talk to him? It's no use. Did you fight him? It didn't work. It didn't work?! Jakoman said that he wants to see you shed tears. That's shameless! It's not really so shameless. What? Are you trying to say something about your father? Just that you were wrong. You're an unworthy son! And yet Jakoman said that he thinks I'm a dutiful son. Hey, Tetsu, why are you shaving now? Where are you going? Is it a woman? Yeah. Do you have a bento box for me? A bento box? Where is this woman? On the other side of the mountain. The other side of the mountain? Be careful! It looks like the snow is very deep. Uh-huh. Hey! Don't prepare a bento box for him! But he's going over the mountain. It will be dawn by then. No way! No one knows when the herring will return to the nest! Read the water. They're still a long way off. I said no and I meant no! Aren't you the woman who's looking for Jakoman? And you're Kyubei's loser son! Where are you going on night like this? Where are you going? You may as well give up trying to catch Jakoman. That one-eyed bandit stays on the move. You'll never be able to catch him! You're really passionate about this. You're the one who needs to be careful. The road is slippery and it's dark. One slip and it's all over! Hiya! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! All right! Father! I am a cadet who was on the same boat as your son. He told me to get this back to you no matter what. You probably think it's strange, but this is our custom. He's very stubborn. He used to fight with me. That's the way he was. When was this taken? When Big Brother graduated. Oh, right, right. My glasses. Ah, I left them inside. How did this happen? You wanted to go find Jakoman. This is what you get. Don't be such a jerk. Leave me alone. You got yourself into this mess. You must really like him. I'm obsessed with him. Does he hate women? He has a wife. A wife? A stunning snow-white beauty. Always living in the ice. A person in the ice? Idiot. Not a person, a bear. A white bear. What does he do with it? He sails around chasing it. Searching for caves like a hunter. Sometimes he goes into town to get drunk. Then he drinks until he's completely broke. He loves drinking alcohol so much that your father was able to steal his boat. Watch out for the white bear he's after. No one can survive it. Uh, did I say anything in my sleep just now? No. I said something! Tell me! I'm sorry. It's been a long time since I've had such a horrible dream. You seem to be angry at the owner of this fishery for some reason. Why are you so interested? No reason... But it's never worth it to think about revenge. What are you talking about? Well, I was also once consumed with the same pointless hatred. I killed a woman. I had been betrayed by the woman I loved. It was just one brief moment of anger. I got carried away. I grabbed my gun and just started shooting. Why did I do such a thing? When I came to my senses the walls were covered in blood. It was all over. Since then my life has been a mess. I wanted to leave and make a fresh start. Everywhere I went, I heard her voice. Could you handle that? And now I've ended up in this place. How can I continue to live like this? Are you ordering me not to take revenge? No, I would never do that. Certainly not. Then leave me alone. Hey, boatman! How much longer do we have to wait out here tonight? Turn the boat around! But we haven't caught any herring! - This is not a good sign! - Huh? There's a storm coming! Don't you know how to read the water?! - Huh? - What? Hurry up! Do it now! Hey! Storm! There's a storm coming! A storm is coming! Storm! Hurry up! Get up! Everyone get up! Hurry up! It's time to pull in the nets! Get up! Move faster! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Run! Go! Still dawdling here, when Tetsu has gone off to his death! Don't panic, Dad. - Hurry, hurry! - Please, everyone! Hey. Today you're getting what you deserve. This is divine punishment! Bastard! You'd better stop. Do you think it's fun to push people down? You want to fight again? I don't have time for that. Why don't you watch us and learn something? Watch what happens! See how the heavens punish you! Sure. We'll see what happens. All right! Let's go! Come on, let's make a big effort! It's coming! Let's go! Come on, everybody! Don't let up! Are you all right? It's coming! Harder! Harder! Here they come! Here they come! Just a little more! Uncle, let me do it! Can you handle it? Don't worry! Leave it to me! Be careful! Good! Harder! Here I go! Oh! Tetsu! The rope! Careful! Be careful, Tetsu! Pull! Come on! - Oh, Tetsu! - Out of the way! It's saved! It's saved! It's saved! It's saved! Hey, how did you like that? Let me have a swig. That's good! Get up! Get up! It's going to rain! Get up! Hey! Get up! What are you doing, Kyubei? None of them can work! What nonsense! The herring are coming in! Come on! come on! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Let them sleep a little longer, Dad. The water temperature is only three degrees. At only three degrees, will the herring even come? Ha! You don't know anything, kid! I have years of experience and you're clueless! If we don't hurry, the fish will swim away! Get up! Get up! Get up! Come on! Get up! Wake up! Get up, come on, get up! Hey! Get up! You're so cruel, old man. No arguing! If you have a complaint, keep it to yourself! If you want to sleep, you won't earn any money! Get up and shove off! - Cut it out, old man! - What? We don't want to be ordered around anymore! - What did you say? - Damn old man! You bastard! Who shouted that? I did! Asshole! Get up! He's not feeling well! What a load of crap! He hasn't started working yet! Get up, you lazy bastard! Tetsu! Come here, Tetsu! Dad, you're the one who's wrong. Don't be so hard on that poor sick man. Break time! Break time! I'm freezing to death! I wonder what the old man would say if he saw us like this. I thought we agreed to allow for breaks. You have to be allowed to catch your breath, right? We are probably not the only ones who take breaks. G-g-g-get a look at this c-c-c-cut! I'm worried it m-m-m-might get infected! - Let's hope not! - Let's hope not! Hey! Jakoman's woman! How's it going? What is Jakoman up to? I'm sorry. I don't believe that he's doing any thinking about you. I don't need you to tell me that. - I'm just asking if he's alive or dead! - Huh? You're... I'm drunk. Can't you tell? Eh? Are you all right? You'll be in trouble if you pass out while driving. Will I die? If I'm gonna die then I'll kill him first before I die. Tonight I'm going to demand an answer. Hiya! Leave him out there. Stinking brat. He's still out at this hour. See if he can get up tomorrow. Don't bother helping him! But it's so cold outside. If he freezes out there, how will he be able to work tomorrow? You're always such a good person. Can't you see how much Dad adores Tetsu? This house will be Tetsu's in the future. We'll be left high and dry. You can't say that. Tetsu's our little brother. I'm just saying that Dad favors him over you, dummy! Taka! Don't open that door! Taka! You're bothering your father, coming home at such a late hour. - Huh?! - Huh?! It's J-Jakoman's-- What's that silly look on your face? You're always the one pointing the gun. Has no one ever pointed a gun at you? You're drunk, you bitch. Sorry. I'm drunk. I can see your eyes now. There are two of them. If you move again, I'll shoot you. I'm not kidding! Oh yeah? You want to be tied up and dragged by your horse again? What a shame! I let the horse run off! So how are you going to deal with me now? A woman has been desperately chasing after you for three years. You have to have something to say! Say something! Running away again? If you hate me, say you hate me. Just make it clear to me! You hate me, right? Then I'll shoot you. Love mixed with blood! How poetic! - Huh? - So what the hell is it? Leave me alone! You bitch! Get out! You bitch! What are you doing? Why would you do something so extreme? So, Miss. Did you get a clear answer? Hey, what's wrong? Hey! What's wrong? Hey, Big Sister! Could this woman stay and work in our house? You should mind your own business! Stay out of it. I picked her up. What do you care if I want to hire her? Tetsu! It's awful! It's awful! It's a strike! A strike? So you're daring us to strike, old man? - What? - Aren't you? You tell us you'll raise our pay. Give us this, give us that... Then you forget everything as soon as the job is done. Yeah! Now, now, let's not argue. Let's have some tea first. You should have some first. Idiot! What are you doing serving tea? I was trying to get rid of them! You see, the old man is going to cheat us again. - Huh? - Yeah. That's right! That boat was saved from the storm thanks to us! What about the reward you promised? How can you not keep your word? That was for the next herring catch! And after that catch, you'll say you don't remember! Yeah! That's true. Dad, how much are you paying your workers now? Well, 4,200 for the boatman, 3,000 for ordinary hired help. Oh? What about room and board? They pay. That's not right! The standard market price this year is 6,000. Tetsu! Dad didn't make any money, though! Dad is even poorer now! Even so, that's too little. Whatever you say. The money is all yours anyway. We don't have a share. Masa, why are you telling him that? I do all the work inside and outside the house, but in the end it's all for nothing! Dad and Masa are saying that they are the ones who do everything. But we can't catch a single fish without these workers. Yeah! You disrespectful brat! You're taking their side against your own father? I'm not taking sides. I'm just being fair. You idiot! You don't know how hard I work! I'm desperately struggling to make money with this fishery! I have to recruit people to build it up! That has nothing to do with this. I can't afford to pay any more! That's no excuse! How dare you?! You miserable little brat! Tetsu, what are you doing? This is your own father! You brat! Kyubei! You stupid brat! Dad, don't hit Tetsu! - Brat! - Dad! You brat! You brat! Brat! Brat! Brat! Brat! Brat! Brat! Stop them! Go stop them! Stop them! Dad! Stop! St-- Don't hit him, Dad! You ungrateful son! You're an ungrateful son! This is unbelievable. A father and son fighting... How could a father do this? Listen, everyone! We can't go soft! Yeah! If we threaten to strike then we have to follow through! - Let's go! - Let's go! Dad, the herring are ready to be caught. What do we do? Those workers won't hold out. They want more money now but they're sure to come back begging for work. But look at them like that... Idiot! Just let them relax. They'll cool off after a while. What the hell are we doing, man? This was never a good idea. Yeah... If the fish come while we're striking, what about our money? We d-d-d-definitely won't get paid. He's d-d-d-drowning in d-d-d-debt. We should... We should... I can't go home empty-handed! No! Don't! It's good to catch more. But I'm not gonna do it without getting paid. Yeah! If this company closes down then he won't be able to pay us for our work! - Yeah! - We can't back down! Otherwise the old man will bleed us more and more. That's right! The herring are coming in. See if he doesn't get anxious. We can't back down now. But in the past there was no such thing as workers not helping the boss. Yeah! That's how it is. Other fisheries have their own reasons for their high rates. Yeah! I... I can't go home without getting paid. Same here. My kids are depending on this money to live. Yeah! We're all in need of money. We have to fight for something, even if it's just a little bit more. I agree! I'm more worried about our p-p-p-pay than his temper. Yeah. I want to keep working. - I don't want to quit either. - Neither do I. I knew this would happen. You all talk a good game, but you're really just wimps! What are you talking about? Am I wrong? Huh? Sitting there crying... Hesitant and indecisive... You've fallen for the old fox Kyubei's trick. Then why don't you tell us what we should do? Just don't do any work. See what he does then. Fight against Kyubei to the end! Hey, everyone! How much longer do you want to wait? Speak up! What should we do? The fish are already here. They're here? Did you say they're there? All right! Let's go! Here we go! Here we go! The herring are here! Everyone! Get moving! Get moving! Go catch lots! Go catch lots! Hey, what's wrong with all of you? The herring are here! Go now! Hey, aren't you going to go? Are you all crazy? Hey! I give in! I give in! More! More! I'll pay you more! I'll really pay more! Now help me! I'm begging you, go get the fish! I'm a man of my word! Please! All right! I'm begging! I'm begging! Hmph! Who knows how many times you've begged for something? Yeah! At least th-th-three times! Yeah! I'm not lying. I really do have the money to pay you. I'm begging you, please! I'm begging you all! Hey, what do you think? He seems to be telling the truth this time. But with him, who knows? Yeah! I don't think we need to worry about that. You all won. There will be no more holding back payment. I say, people, no one has to be forced to do hard work here. You were hired to help with the fishing. Since you were hired, you can certainly ask for proper pay. If you don't get paid again then we will split the herring with you! Tetsu! What are you saying?! Why don't we be partners instead of opponents? It's time for the fish to come in. Isn't that right, everyone? - That's right! - That's right! You rebellious little brat! Here comes the old man again. You won't kick me out this time, will you? I'll be catching herring alongside you. I won't let you outdo me. Silly fool! It's time to go right now! It'll be no use casting the net after they've already left! Yes! Everything will be fine if the herring are caught! We can also negotiate for money if we have fish! In that case, we're leaving! It's a good time to fish! All right! Let's go! Bring the net! If anyone tries anything... I'll kill them! What are you doing?! I won't let you catch any herring! What?! This is the day I've been waiting for. Another thirty minutes and the herring will leave. You can stand there frightened until then! Any regrets now, old man? I finally got to see this look on your face! So what now? Let's see what you can do! Stop! I want you to stay in this mood for an entire year. It's all right, no need to hold back. Go ahead and cry. Scream and cry! Shed your tears! Don't you move! If you want to be a good son, stay still. You move and I'll make your old man eat a bullet! You two fight well. I won't interfere. Hokkaido is a big place. What are you saying? Our work has nothing to do with your fighting! Yeah! This is our fishing ground! We'll get the herring ourselves! We won't let you stand in our way! Yeah! Just try it! My gun doesn't care who you are! Nobody moves...or I'll shoot! For nothing... You're doing it for nothing. What?! I understand how you feel, but what can you do once you take revenge? Huh? Afterwards you will be chased... Not just by others. No. You will be chased by your own conscience wherever you go. Like I am. I know personally what it's like. I advise you to let it go. Don't take revenge. You... Do you want to get yourself killed? If you want to fight, go ahead. But don't make it hard for everyone else. I feel like this time maybe I can start over again. Don't move! Don't move! I want you to stay still! All right... Don't stop then! I'll kill him! - Stop! - Mind your own business! You bitch! - Do you have to cut it? - Yes! - Do you have to? - Yes! Idiot! Take a look over there first. The herring are not yours. They belong to the fishermen! You won't just be hurting my old man but all the fishermen as well! How about it? Do you still want to cut it? Do you want to make it impossible for those innocent fishermen to make a living? If you still want to cut it then I can't stop you. But you'll have to cut off my hand first! Dear! Dear! Don't! Don't! Don't! I'm asking you for the last time. What's it going to be? Cut or not? Jakoman! Forget it. There's no use in cutting off your hand. Jakoman! You... If you don't go, you'll lose them. Wake up, you disgusting high school boy, you. Thank you. Thank you! I won't forget this! Dear! Hey, what's wrong with you? Someone help! Hey, someone help! What? What's wrong? It seems this is the only way to find out who he is. Should we open it? Don't bother with pointless things. He came here to escape by forgetting the past. Do not let the dead be dishonored. Then...let's forget it. AND SO, THE HERRING FISHING SEASON HAS COME TO AN END. Good work! Tominjo Murai! Here you go. Next, Sadakuro Shimano! Not bad, not bad. How's that? I'm a man of my word, right? Don't say I demand things from you anymore! That's more than enough for you to live on! I'd be grateful if you'd come back again. If only you could always have this kind of heart... We'll all be looking out for each other next year. Right, guys? Right! KYUBEI GUARDHOUSE MARCH 27, 1946 GRAVE OF OSAKA TSUYOSHI Hey. You forgot something. Mind your own business! Oh? I'll take her as my wife then. If you love her... make it clear to her! How long will you keep running away? A hunter can't afford to like a woman. Poaching isn't popular these days. Once you're past the mountain, don't hunt that bear anymore. This is not a lot of money, but it will come in handy. You bastard. Don't be so angry. Go on. Ah, yes, yes! Finally done! We've made so much money it'll last us a few years. It's so silly. What are you talking about? The more money you have, the better. Money! Everything in this world depends on money. Listen to you! You really are the old man's daughter. Huh? Tetsu, where are you going? Today is Saturday. But where are you going with your bag packed? Huh? I... I'm... I'm still a sailor. I can't keep on weaving nets and fishing here. Big Brother, take care of the fishery. Big Sister, take care of...Mom. Tetsu! Tetsu! Huh? Hey, why are you making that face? You... We were just getting used to having you around... Don't talk stupid! I kill and sell whales for a living. - Tetsu! - Tetsu! You're leaving again? Yeah. You know, Dad... A rebellious son like you is not cut out to inherit the fishery! I never thought you'd understand me so well. Idiot! I'm not letting you off the hook. You're still your old man's son. Well, I'm off. Tetsu! Yeah? Nothing... Go get some pocket money from your mother to take with you. Yeah, I got some. I'm getting paid for a full day's work. This kid... Take care of your health, old man. Make sure you don't catch a cold. Mind your own business! THE END
