(INDISTINCT CHATTER) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) INTERVIEWER: You must be getting quite bored of these. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Never dull to discuss the work. Okay, well, I thought we could just jump straight in, if that's okay with you. -By all means. -Okay. Hello. Liam Somers' story of a fading patriarch presiding over a grief-stricken family has been described as one of the most striking debuts of the year. Here with us to discuss his first novel is the author. Thank you for joining us, Liam. Thanks for having me. So, I thought we could start off by touching on the inspiration behind the novel. What exactly is it that drew you to tell this story? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (BICYCLE BRAKE SQUEALING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) -Hello? -HATTIE: (OVER PHONE) Liam. It's Hattie from the agency. I'm on my way to a lesson. Can it wait? We cancelled that. Something's come in for you. (BICYCLE WHEELS WHIRRING) Writers tend to say they're a morning person, or an evening kind of writer. I don't subscribe to that. (DOOR OPENS) If you're writing, you're writing. Simple as that. It's not something that can be deferred or denied if you have to do it. Which, by the way, is the prerequisite for writing. You don't have a choice in the matter. You must write. SINCLAIR: (OVER LAPTOP) Listen, if I knew where the ideas came from, I'd have written, and indeed been paid a hell of a lot more than I have. Bearing in mind that I've been prolific and not badly off, the short answer is I don't know. (BELL DINGS) SINCLAIR: I know writers who obsess. "How do I say something original? "Am I saying something unique?" I'm sorry. (CHUCKLING) There are no new ideas. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Most writers are reconciled to the fact. And if they're not, they pretty soon will be. (TRUCK HONKING) SINCLAIR: Now, average writers attempt originality. They fail. Universally. Good writers have the sense to borrow from their betters. (GATE CREAKING) But the greats, great writers... steal. (LAUGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GRAVEL CRUNCHING) (DOOR OPENS) -Good morning. -Good morning. -Mr. Somers. -It's Liam. If you'd like to follow me this way, please. (DUCKS QUACKING) You'll find him just there. I'll take that, shall I? Thank you. Hello. I'm Liam. You must be Bertie. BERTIE: You've done your homework. -Are your parents around? -They're up at the house. Why? I usually speak to parents before the first lesson. It's fine. I can get my father if you want? -I'm sure he won't mind. -No, I don't wanna disturb. But you want to meet him, right? -It's fine. -He's only writing. No, it's fine! Okay. So, what are we working on? We are working on tragedy. Modern? Ancient? I don't need you to turn the pages. Congratulations, by the way. English Literature is one of the most competitive courses. Oxford don't shortlist many candidates so your aptitude test must have been very impressive. But that test is one thing. The interviews, the college-specific tests, they're different. You'll need to cultivate the kind of critical thinking that might not be familiar to you... yet. Kind of a house style. They staple at Oxford, don't they? You can do it in the house style. (LAWNMOWER WHIRRING) (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) HELENE: Liam. -LIAM: Mrs. Sinclair. -Helene. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Your CV was impressive. Your agency speaks very highly of you. That's kind of them. Well, I should hope not. I should hope it's true. You've a beautiful home, Mrs. Sinclair. Thank you. Summer suits it. This is the reading room. It's usually only me in here. We don't use the front entrance much. There is a back door to the garden. LIAM: This is beautiful. Thank you. You made it? It's kind of... numinous. And you've met Ellis. You're laying the table for four tonight. Yes, ma'am. Any dietary requirements, Mr. Somers? Actually, I'm vegan. Wonderful. HELENE: And this is my favorite acquisition. I bought it from the artist when she didn't win the Turner. Kind of a consolation. She's a collector's darling now, of course, but I found her. It's adapted from Bernini's Apollo and Daphne. -Do you know it? -I know the story. HELENE: Hmm. Never had the heart to sell it. Why would you? That's my job. I'm a curator. Shouldn't really get sentimental. Something to drink? You'd like a beer, wouldn't you? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (WATER VOLE SQUEALS) You know, Liam graduated with a First in English. So why is he a tutor? Well, must be a vocation. He wants to share his knowledge, his experience. We thought it best Bertie spend the last of the summer term here so he can focus on his entrance exams. You thought it best? HELENE: Well, that school has let you down enough. I wasn't going to leave this up to chance. You must be good. Evening, all. Bonsoir, my love. (KISSES) How goes it, Bert? Liam, isn't it? -Yes, Mr. Sinclair. -Oh. Thank you. You've come on a good day. Ellis does a mean roast lamb. Thank you. Music. (OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING) We had Rachmaninoff yesterday. Well, give me three good reasons not to listen to him today and... I'll change my mind. HELENE: Why don't we ask our guest? (MUSIC STOPS) Liam, what do you think of Rachmaninoff? Um... He was the last great Russian romantic composer. And... known for his piano concertos more than his symphonies. His, um... He was the conductor of the Bolshoi when the Russian... First Russian Revolution began... The music. She meant, "What did you think of the music?" I don't, um... I'm not familiar. Rachmaninoff it is, then. -(BUTTON CLICKS) -(OPERATIC MUSIC STARTS) Last great Russian romantic. (WOMAN VOCALIZING) (SMACKS LIPS) So, what did you two study today? Hamlet, for the most part. Oh, you looked into the manuscript tradition yet? -I've got, uh, a few articles. -SINCLAIR: Hmm. I can make up a reading list. Thanks. SINCLAIR: You can thank him when you get in. If. If you get in. We should have a chat about the lesson. See how it went. Well, I'm sure Bertie has some... SINCLAIR: I'm sure he does. Which is why we'll discuss it after dinner. You can wait in the drawing room when you're finished eating. Liam... You're out. (WOMAN CONTINUES VOCALIZING) (CUTLERY CLANKING) (OPERATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) HELENE: We'd like you to stay. LIAM: Is this from the agency? I think we can part ways with the agency here. We prefer a personal bond. There have been incidents in the past. LIAM: With guests? With staff. We told them we no longer need a tutor. Didn't wanna compromise your relationship. It's so important Bertie has someone on his side that knows the English system. I studied in Paris and New York. And his father didn't go, of course. Non-disclosure. He's very protective. Getting close to the end, so he tells me. Yes. Five years since the last one. The subject of your thesis. It's on your CV. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) HELENE: You'll report to me at the end of every lesson about Bertie's progress. Come and find me. He has to get in, Liam. Uh, he doesn't know about the thesis, does he, Mrs. Sinclair? I'm sure he'd be flattered. But you're not here for him. (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) (DOOR CLOSES) (PAPERS RUSTLING) (OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) (PEN SCRIBBLING) (SIGHING) (GROANS SOFTLY) (CLICKS TONGUE) (CLOCK TICKING) (BREATHING DEEPLY) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GRUNTS) (GROANS SOFTLY) (GASPS) Good morning. "From fairest creatures we desire increase, "That thereby beauty's rose might never die, "But as the riper should by time decease, "His tender heir might bear his memory." -So you're on to the Sonnets. -So you've learnt a poem. (BOOK SLAMS ON TABLE) I just remember. Have you got a photographic memory? Not quite. Words are like triggers for me. They set off a sequence. So, if I've read them, I'll remember. -You learnt that. -You can try me. -"To be, or not to be." -(SCOFFS) You can do better than that. (PAPER RIPS) "Nativity, once in the main of light, "Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd, "Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight, "And Time that gave doth now his gift confound." "Time doth transfix..." All right, you've got a party trick. I... I get it. I'm sure it helped you get your First. But I can't use it, and I don't need it. So, why don't you fetch me that reading list? Shall I write it down so you don't forget? (WATER VOLE SQUEALING) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES) How did it go? Well. Independent research, mainly. Is that your usual practice? It varies. For a student of Bertie's intelligence, I'd say independence is a good thing. You're the best resource he could have. He needs to be making use of you. Otherwise, why are you here? I'll make sure he does. Good. (CONTINUES PLAYING PIANO) That's Tchaikovsky, isn't it? (STOPS PLAYING) June, from The Seasons. I thought you weren't familiar with classical. I'm learning. (CHUCKLES) Me, too. Trying. (CHUCKLES) Are you the only one who plays? Bertie used to. Beautifully. His brother wrote. Mostly short stories. Like you. He took after his father. HELENE: He likes to have someone around. An amanuensis. (SIGHS) Used to be me at the start. We don't talk about his work. We don't talk about Felix. Follow those rules and you should be fine. (STARTS PLAYING PIANO) Of course. (MUSIC STOPS) (EXHALES) Great writers... steal. (ALL LAUGHING) INTERVIEWER: But do you think it's inevitable that elements of your... personal life seep into your work? Um, you're somebody who has experienced great personal tragedy, and I'm wondering if the loss of your son has had a direct impact on the nature of your writing. If I were drawing on my life, I'd be writing memoir, not fiction. But if you're asking if it has affected my writing, the answer is yes. In as much as any loss affects one's life. Losing a child is... losing a part of oneself. And bound up with the grief is a profound sense of injustice... ...of being robbed. And when they take their own life... one is... compelled to the unthinkable. To grieve the child is to grieve the killer. But if you're asking me seriously, and I sincerely hope that you're not, whether my son's death has inspired my writing, the answer is no, I will not be writing about his death. I will be writing in spite of it. And you will have your novel... (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK) ...when it is ready. -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -INTERVIEWER: Mr. Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair. (DOOR CLICKS, SLAMS) (CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Liam, just family tonight. There will be fixings in the guest house. -Sure. See you tomorrow. -SINCLAIR: Three, four, close the door. Five, six, pick up sticks. (MUFFLED) Bingo. Bon appetit. (MUSIC STOPS) (GASPS) (FROG CROAKING) (CROAKS) (FROGS CHIRPING) (FLIES BUZZING) Oh, good morning, Mr. Somers. Something I can help you with? Yes. We've run out of coffee in my, uh... -place. -Can't have that. -I'll put a pot on now. -Thanks. Just getting us some coffee. I'm glad you're making yourself useful. SINCLAIR: (YELLS) Fucking hell! Everything okay, Mr. Sinclair? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) -Don't you have a lesson? -Bertie's just setting up. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) The printer. LIAM: What are you trying to do? Print something. LIAM: Do you mind? The printer's the problem. Nothing to do with that thing. (CLICKING) (PRINTER WHIRRING) -My dad worked in IT. -Oh, sins of the father. Yeah, I know a bit. Thanks. -That's Winterson. -I beg your pardon? "Empty space and points of light." Jeanette Winterson. Final words of Sexing the Cherry. "And even the most solid of things "and the most real, the best loved "and the well-known are only hand-shadows "on the wall. Empty space and points of light." (SINCLAIR CHUCKLES) Oh. Good spot. Is it research? Close the door on your way out, will you? Mustn't keep Bert waiting. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) (DOOR CLOSES) ELLIS: Hope you like it strong, Mr. Somers. Thank you. It's Liam. I know. Might be useful if I could read some of what you're writing. Useful for who? (LEAVES RUSTLING) (STREAM TRICKLING) (STUTTERS) No, Liam. Can't touch the buds. Why not? BERTIE: It's rhododendron. Have you never been in a garden before? Not everyone has gardens like this. It's poisonous. There's toxins in the sap. (LIGHTER FLICKS) Do you want one? All right. Cheers. It's basically a weed. Nothing can grow around it. The roots, they, uh... They strangle everything they touch. It's quite clever, actually. Felix was obsessed with them. Rhododendron. The rose tree. It's ancient Greek. (THUNDER RUMBLING) They are beautiful. That's not why he was obsessed with them. (RAIN PATTERING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) -(RAIN PATTERING) -(SIGHS) Oh, no, no, no, no. (SHOUTS) Shit! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (DOOR OPENS) Oh, Mr. Somers. There's been a slight delay to your laundry. I have brought you a fresh change of clothes. I'll just put them down here, if that's all right? -Sure. Oh, I can do that. -No, no, no, no. It's quite all right, Mr. Somers. You are expected at dinner. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (CUTLERY CLANKING SOFTLY) (SLURPS) HELENE: Liam, so sorry. We should have warned you. The power tends to go down in a storm. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) The price of isolation. (CHAIR SCRAPING FLOOR) (ELECTRICITY HUMS) -"And there was." -(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CUTLERY CLANKING) Any objections to Beethoven? -(BUTTON CLICKS) -(GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (LIQUID POURING) You boys didn't lose anything in the storm, did you? I didn't. We were making great progress, I think. SINCLAIR: Oh, in that case, I may need to borrow you this evening. Computer is playing up again. You don't mind, do you, Liam? LIAM: That's fine. I have tomorrow's lesson planned. SINCLAIR: Good. You know, Liam's a writer, too. Mmm. Did you show Bertie -your student pieces? -BERTIE: No, no. I've seen the novel. Tower 24. Working title. It's actually quite good. Reads like a Sinclair. That's why the desk lamp is burning into the night. I haven't worked on it in a long time. It's, um, it's not finished. Then why does Bertie have it? Thanks. SINCLAIR: Come and see me after dinner. You know where I am. It suits you. Felix's clothes. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES) This damn thing buckles in a storm, and I need to know that my work is safe. You've got multiple backups, right? Oh, I used to have people do that for me. -PAs, you know. -But not anymore. Well, people like that can be very nosy. -(KEYBOARD CLACKING) -(CLICKING) You need to enter your password. Okay. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) I can run a backup to the Cloud if you want. Oh, absolutely not. I don't give my work away for free. Looks like there's another server running. Is it here? Oh, that... Oh, it's next door. Used to be part of the study. Don't need the space. -You want me to shut it down? -No, keep it running. Just in case. Okay. (TAPS KEYBOARD) Now, you should be safe for the next storm. Goodnight, Mr. Sinclair. (CHUCKLES) Wow, that was quick. Scotch? Sit down. If you're serious about doing this, you must bear one thought cheerfully in mind whenever you put pen to paper. Whenever you read, eat, drink, fuck, whatever, one thought. One simple one. Good writers borrow. -Great writers steal. -Don't tell me you're a fan. (LAUGHING) There is a new novel. Started a while back. Almost over the line. I was wondering if you might be on hand for the final stretch. Keep the story safe, provide some amusement. I've found in the past that can be really useful. Someone separate from work. You know, not a writer, preferably. Well, not a real one. So easy to forget... it's only really a game. Oh, don't want to distract from Bert's studies. No. No, you wouldn't. SINCLAIR: And I'd pay, of course. Take it you're in? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (GLASSES CLINK) We'll make a thief of you yet. (BOTH LAUGH) What's it called? Rose Tree. What do you think? I love it. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) HELENE: What did you two talk about? Liam, I won't tell. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Oh, hello. Are you lost? Ah! The missing mother. What are we discussing? Bertie. How he's doing. SINCLAIR: Course. The boy wonder. Going to be another late one I'm afraid, my love. (WHISPERS) Pay me a visit, won't you? HELENE: Of course, darling. (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) SINCLAIR: (OVER LAPTOP) Friends, family, there must be sacrifice. When you embark upon a novel, and begin that communion with yourself, you are alone. Armed only with your craft and, hopefully, your talent. (CHUCKLES) BERTIE: What's that? It's an essay of yours. (PAPERS RUSTLE) This is good, Bertie. I'd love to have thought of this. Your reading list helped. How can I make it better? And in your conclusion, you might wanna to consider Shakespeare's familiarity with Hippolytus. I didn't know that you were allowed to make connections like that, you know, between texts, across the genres. (CHUCKLES) It's like a whole different thing. (LAUGHING) Sorry, but there are no new ideas. To our Alexander and our Aristotle. Most writers are reconciled to the fact. And if they're not, they very soon will be. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY, INHALES) (PEN CAP CLICKS) (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (DOOR CREAKS) -(KEYS JINGLING) -(DOOR LOCKING) Oh, Liam. Give that the once-over, will you? Yeah. Flower-Gathering is my favorite. From A Boy's Will. Oh. "Are you dumb because you know me not, "Or dumb because you know?" Well spotted. Come in. Everything's fine. You've still got that server running next door. SINCLAIR: Oh, forget that. It's dormant. -Or I can just shut it down. -Leave it. Your father teach you all that? I learned. He didn't teach me. I'll wager he's glad you didn't go into IT. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) What are people saying about me? People think you've retired. (CHUCKLING) You are amusing. (CHUCKLES) HELENE: Have you only just got out? We're getting our money's worth, aren't we? You and Bertie seem to be getting along. This new arrangement isn't drawing your focus away from him, is it? LIAM: No, not at all. "What makes an ending?" That's what we've been talking about. He's thinking of his own. Have you seen it? LIAM: No. But he's writing? I think so. I think he's close. He calls me "the missing mother," because I wasn't there when our son died. I was in Venice. The Biennale. I don't go anymore. -You're up late. -So are you. You know you're not the first, right? Get some sleep, Bertie. Goodnight. Night. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING OVER PROJECTOR) (WATER SPLASHING) SINCLAIR: Say I die. Right here, right now. Who owns my words? I don't mean in a legal sense. I mean, testament to experience. Words I chose because I believed they bore witness to a truth beyond fiction. Because, when strung together, they accorded to a music only I could hear. Resolved some conflict raging within me. Who owns them? They belong to whoever chooses to read them. And since we are the words we write... so do we. -Finders fucking keepers. -(BOTH CHUCKLE) (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER PROJECTOR) Oh. Only gods come out of the machine, Liam. Ghosts stay in them. You've said that before. In Pearlescence. Did I? Jesus, I'm repeating myself now. And from one of your lesser works. -(SCOFFS) -(ENGINE WHIRRING) You know, I don't even remember half of that one. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING OVER PROJECTOR) First draft. Tad shorter than usual. Thought you might like to proofread it. Would that be a problem? Not if you read mine. All right. (CHUCKLES) Drop it in first thing tomorrow morning. (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) (GUNSHOTS ON SCREEN) Dante. Tolstoy. Flaubert. Not a single one of them read. What the fuck do they even teach you at that school? May as well burn them. You may as well be illiterate. Are you? What your brother would have given to read any of these works that you shun. At least he had the intellect to read mine. (BERTIE SOBBING) (SIGHS) Oh, Bert, come here. It's me. It's me. (EXHALES) (BERTIE CRYING) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR SLAMS) -Morning. -LIAM: Morning. My novel. Tower 24. Longhand. Like the best. Look forward to it. Oh, take those, would you? (SOBBING) -I can't do this. He's right. -Bertie. (SOBBING) I haven't read... I don't fucking... I don't know enough. I've not read enough. I'm wasting my time. I'm wasting your time. It's just all a fucking waste. Stop it, stop it. Hey. Hey. -Stop it. Stop it. -(BERTIE CRYING) Hey. Listen to me. Look at me. Take a breath. Take a breath. Bertie. Bertie. Look at me. Just one breath. One breath. (BREATHING DEEPLY) It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (BERTIE CRYING) (SOFTLY) Hey. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (BERTIE SNIVELS) I won't let him bother you. It's too late for that. (HESITATES) You... can go if you want. I understand. When you said I wasn't the first, what did you mean? I know I'm not the first tutor. But that's not what you meant, is it? My father likes keeping his favorites close. He moved Felix into the room next to his, for fuck's sake. I'm not Felix. I know. Take the day off, Bertie. So you're not leaving? No. I'm not going anywhere. (BERTIE EXHALES) (WATER SPLASHING) (INHALES) (WATER WARBLING) (PANTING) Good swim? Yeah. Not as warm as it looks. Don't do it again. -I'm sorry? -Lake's off limits. For their sake. It's only been two years since Felix. They're a little delicate. -I'm sorry. I didn't know. -You do now. I finished your novel, by the way. Bring mine over tonight, we'll debrief. LIAM: I might need a little more time to finish reading it. You found time to swim. (KNOCKS ON DOOR) SINCLAIR: Come in. (SINCLAIR SIGHS) I've annotated the text where I've spotted anything. There's a cross-referenced document on my laptop. Very thorough. Well, don't keep me in suspense. LIAM: It's like nothing you've written before. It was hard to read. What... (CHUCKLES) Why? Because even if I started writing it, even if I... devoted my entire life... I wouldn't come close. I mean, the voice, the rhythm, the cadences. It just feels... It feels new. I don't know how you've done it, but you sound new. It very well could be a masterpiece. But, um, the ending. -Part three? -Mmm-hmm. It feels like a different novel. (EXHALES SOFTLY) Like it doesn't belong here. The work just deserves better. -I had to tell you that. -Mmm. You seem to have misunderstood, Liam. We're not peers. You're a proofreader. But as you've begun... we'll suspend disbelief a while. Your first novel. Something of a misnomer, is it not? -How do you mean? -It's not a novel. It's passable airport fiction. I can see why you gave up on it. (PAGES RUSTLING) Could be tweaked into a short story, a novella at best. I could easily pass it on to my editor for a second opinion. But I have a reputation. Imagine. My publisher wakes up one morning, finds a message from me claiming to have found the next best thing. Tower 24. He'd think I'd cracked. I can't put my name to just anything. That's years of work. Really? How frustrating. Then again, I'll never get back the hours -I spent reading it. -(TAPPING ON BOOK) We needn't waste any more time. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) -I'm sorry. -SINCLAIR: Oh, don't be. You weren't to know. Oh, have you considered teaching? This isn't about the writing. Oh, it's only ever about the writing, Liam. And I regret to say... you cannot write. Send me that document, would you? I'll do it before I leave. SINCLAIR: Ah! You're not finished yet. You can find someone else. SINCLAIR: Liam. You signed the agreement. Great shame to break your bond now. I so loathe dealing with lawyers. I'm saving your life, Liam. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) (SCOFFS) Fuck! (SIGHS) (WATER WARBLING) (SPLASHING) HELENE: I thought you didn't want to do public appearances. Just dropping into the conference, surprise them all. Spontaneity, darling. You remember that, don't you? (CAR DOOR OPENS) Ah! The tutor. Did you want something? I just wanted to say thank you. I'm honored that you read my work. -Still waiting on that email. -I'll send it today. Uh, no disclosure of my work to any third party, as per the agreement. That includes Helene. Liam, you're welcome. -(CAR DOOR CLOSES) -(ENGINE TURNS OVER, REVS) LIAM: You've been brought up by the most revered writer in the country. So, why should I give you a place? Well, uh, he's a writer. I want to be able to learn to read work. You know, to learn to criticize. How do you criticize your father? (CHUCKLES) I haven't read his work. That's not what I asked. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I asked how you'd criticize your father. Nothing can grow around him. My father never raised us. He just made us sick. How? Not caring is worse than cruelty. What his son wanted was his approval and he couldn't give it. -But don't you want it? -No. Look where that got Felix. My brother didn't go into the water to swim. But you could. I did. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (FAINT LAUGHTER, CHATTER) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (SIGHS SOFTLY) Whoo! (BERTIE WHOOPING) I've been invited to an 18th tonight and my mother is worried that it's gonna distract me from our prep. I'm not worried. We've been working very hard. -You're sick to death of me. -(BERTIE CHUCKLES) And I think he could do with a night out of here. What would your father say? He's not here. Where are you gonna stay? At the flat. Well, get a cab if you need to, please. -Thank you. -(HELENE CHUCKLES) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR CLOSES) LIAM: Can I help? Yes. Ah. (LIAM GRUNTS) HELENE: Thank you. LIAM: Have you thought about letting Bertie be somewhere else this summer? HELENE: Well, if Bertie's not here, there's no reason for you to be. I love it, too. LIAM: I didn't say that. HELENE: You didn't have to. What did he do, Liam? Did he destroy you, too? (LIGHTER FLICKS) HELENE: What do you want now? LIAM: To do my job. Help Bertie get out. And leave. Don't lie. I think you want the same thing I do. And what's that? Why does he lock my dead son's door if he's got nothing to hide? I wanna know. Don't you? (DOOR UNLOCKS) (DOOR CREAKS) (CLICKS BUTTON) (MOUSE WHEEL SCROLLING) (MOUSE BUTTON CLICKS) (CAR DOOR OPENS) (KEYS JINGLE) (DOOR UNLOCKS, SHUTS) (KEYS CLATTER) (KEYS JINGLE) (CAR DOOR OPENS) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) -(GRAVEL CRUNCHING) -(DOOR OPENS) -(KEYS CLATTER) -Mr. Somers? The usual? Yes. (DISHES RATTLING) How are you feeling? Like shit. And I can't find that Bronte article anywhere. SINCLAIR: Liam. I need you in the study. -We're still working. -Now. So, where is everything? -Fuck. -What? This looks like a virus. It's... It's taken everything. SINCLAIR: Restore it from the backup. LIAM: Well, you never disconnected the drive. It must have been running, so it's gone down too. -The other server. -It's all... (SIGHS) It's all gone, Mr. Sinclair. What? I wanted to shut it down. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) It's the malware. It must have come from my computer when I sent you the documents, the annotations. What? I am so sorry. HELENE: So unlike you to be so careless, darling. Especially when it's taken you so long. (SINCLAIR BREATH TREMBLING) But you've still got the hard copy. Close that door. (DOOR CREAKS) He must have left it at the conference. Yeah. It's James Sinclair. Uh, could you put me through to the Conference Centre, please? Yes, I'll hold. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) HELENE: You've already looked in there, darling. Well, it's not at the conference. It's not at the hotel. Not in the car, not in the house. Someone has taken my novel. Someone here has it. Which one of you is it, hmm? Oh, you've taken it, haven't you? Ah. Tucked it away somewhere, have you? So neat and tidy. Where have you hidden it, Bert? We all know you're hiding something. Where is it? Where is it? -(SHOUTS) Where is it? -That's enough! "It had been overcast all morning. "But when we were clear of the bay, "the sun split the cloud bank in two, "and threw light onto the water. "Thin films of petrol, "swirling rainbows. "I was unsteady on my feet as I approached the bow. "Someone grabbed my arm, stood me upright. "I hadn't known how heavy her ashes would be." SINCLAIR: How much do you remember? All of it. HELENE: Bertie, go get your things. BERTIE: Now? HELENE: Now, sweetheart. SINCLAIR: But you're leaving tomorrow. I'm giving you the space you need, no distractions. Ellis. Bring me my bags, please. SINCLAIR: He knows I didn't mean it. I need you here. -You need to write the book. -I've written it. Then it shouldn't be too hard to remember. Is Liam coming? LIAM: Just carry on like we've done. You'll be ready. Good luck, Bertie. He'll never get in. That's what you said about Felix. -(GRUNTS) -(VASE SHATTERS) -That's my work. -That's the feeling. I married a writer. So write. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) Boys and their mothers, Liam. Bet you weren't pampered like that. -No. -Shall we? We use this. Won't need to back this fucker up. This fucking place. You waiting for something? (FLIPPING PAPERS) Good start. We'll pick up tomorrow. Night, Liam. What was it? How did it go? -I remember... -Oh, uh, ah... (LAWNMOWER WHIRRING) "But even from a distance, I could read something absent "in her bearing, a frailty that I hadn't seen..." (WHIRRING) (WATER VOLE CRIES) (SQUEAKING) I didn't write that. It's the end of Part Two. (READING) "These moments rise up before me "like shards of light in a shallow pool, "never joined for long enough to tell the storm..." (SCOFFS) I didn't write that. You're changing my work. -I'm not. -Who's the fucking writer? (PAPER CRUMBLING) (SINCLAIR EXHALES DEEPLY) Right. End of Part Two. (SIGHS) Let's call it a night. (DOOR OPENS) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) You know, your novel wasn't bad. Wasn't bad. She thinks I'm done. But we'll show her. (SLEEPILY) We'll show her, Felix. (CLOCK TICKING) (EXHALES) (DOOR OPENS) HELENE: Ellis, would you mind? (DOOR CLOSES) SINCLAIR: Welcome home. We've been working. -So you're finished? -Not yet. Better hurry up. You need to get started on the next one. -(SINCLAIR SCOFFS) -Where's Bertie? -In London. -How is he? He's fine. Preparing. Darling, collect the bags from the car, please. Oh, sure. Liam, can I see you in the studio, please? Why? To extend our arrangement. His words, the ones you spoke. They're not his. They're my son's. Then why has it taken him all this time to write? It wasn't finished. He gave it an ending. And? Hmm. Then I'd like you to write one. The shorter the better. Consider this your first commission. How soon can you get this done? I'll start it now. Good. Better get on with it. SINCLAIR: Return to normality. We missed you, my love. HELENE: Shall we have some music? Of course. Some Schubert for the homecoming. Liam, you choose. (SOFTLY) Ah. We're getting close. I'll call the publishers tomorrow and let them know it's on its way. Well, I've already been in touch with them -and your editor. -What? I'll speak to them. No, you won't. I'll deal with that. No more distractions. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) You just focus on finishing. You deserve to. You've been held back too long. (INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING) (KEYBOARD CLACKING) (PRINTER CLATTERING, WHIRRING) (PRINTER WHIRRING) You don't mind if I deliver this, do you? (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) SINCLAIR: "And then... "And then she walked "along the shoreline... "as far as I could see... "her dress trailing in the... "The..." -"Wash..." -"Wash!" BOTH: "...of the tide." LIAM: "The waves -"took her footprints." -SINCLAIR: "Footprints." BOTH: "I... followed... after." "The end." (SINCLAIR SIGHS IN RELIEF) We did it. -(PEN CAP CLICKS) -It's done. -We fucking did it! -(GRIMACING) Oh. Oh. (KISSES) (GROANS) Come here. Come here. -(SINCLAIR GRUNTS) -(LIAM GROANS SOFTLY) -(GROWLING) -(SOFTLY) Steady. You and I... we finished that bastard. Okay. This calls for a celebration. All gone! (CHUCKLES) (BOTTLE THUDS) -(BOTTLE OPENS) -SINCLAIR: Oh. -(SINCLAIR LAUGHS) -(BOTTLES CLINKING) Congratulations, Mr. Sinclair. Cheers! I called it Rose Tree, because I wrote it for him. He was the only one. The only one who understood. I found him, you know. Not his mother, not Bert. Both had better things to do. I dragged him out of that water. He had a real talent. I tried to help him. Constructive criticism, like I gave you. But he was weaker than I thought. Depressive. If I'd known... (VOICE BREAKS) he would have done something that stupid... I wouldn't have said... (SOBBING) ...anything to him. Right. You, me, swim. Right now! (CLAPS) No excuses. Come on, Liam! (SHOUTS) Come on! (BOTTLE CLANKING) Exercise makes the day, Liam. Are you coming in? LIAM: Of course. SINCLAIR: Good man. Now, how... How... How... How do you want to be credited? -How about "author"? -(CHUCKLES) How's that? It must have hurt you. When you saw Rose Tree for the first time, of course, you wished it was yours. I did, too. He was better than both of us. Rose Tree is mine. I wrote the book. No. Felix wrote it. You stole it. But I bet you... he came to you for advice. And I bet you, you crushed him. He's my son. I gave him every word of that novel, and when he couldn't see it through to the end, I did. You know, I found the original on his server. And I wiped it. Yours, too. I threw the printout into the lake. Helene knows. That's why she asked me to write it and finish it. (SINCLAIR GRUNTS) 'Cause she knew you'd ruin that novel. She begged me to save it from you. You're no writer. That's not what your wife thinks. You don't fucking know her. I know what she tastes like. What? (SINCLAIR GROWLING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SINCLAIR GASPING) (GRUNTS) Drown. Drown! Drown, you... (MUTTERS) (LIAM STRUGGLING) Drown! Drown, you fucking... (SINCLAIR GRUNTS) (LIAM STRUGGLING) (PANTING) -(BLOW LANDS) -SINCLAIR: Ah! (SINCLAIR GASPS) -You coward! -(LIAM GRUNTS) You fucking coward! (SINCLAIR GROANS) (LIAM PANTING) (PANTING) ELLIS: Ah, we'll get that seen to. And I'll get you some dry clothes. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) (WATER BUBBLES) (INSECTS TRILLING) (GROANS SOFTLY) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) Is he okay? (GRIMACES) HELENE: I've read them both, and you were right. Yours is the superior ending. His is a... (SIGHS) great shame. You can get started now. -(LIGHTER CLICKS) -(FLAMES FLUTTER) (FIREWOOD CRACKLING) (HELENE CLICKS TONGUE) I want to thank you for everything you've done. You were perfect. Remarkable, even. This is how the story goes. My husband, after completing his latest novel... drowned himself in the lake where his son died. We'd been worried about him and his drinking for a while. We did all we could to save him... (EXHALES) ...but it was too late. -What? -And you, Liam, you were never here. You signed an NDA. If you choose to break our agreement, there is another story. Two witnesses can testify to the murder of my husband by an obsessive fan, a would-be writer, that took a teaching job so he could be close to his idol, and who snapped when his hero told him something he didn't like. I don't want any kind of scandal, but if I have to, I will make you the villain of this story. This was never for Bertie. I brought you here to get me the truth. And when I knew, my husband was always gonna join my son in the water. Rose Tree will be their legacy. The ending. I wrote the ending. You have to give me that. I wrote the fucking ending. And I'm grateful. That's why I'm giving you a chance. I'm going to call an ambulance, and I don't wanna have to explain your presence when it arrives. Much better that you never existed at all. My version of events is the only version. You can see that. You have talent. You just needed a story. Tell Bertie... Don't tell Bertie. The gates will close behind you. (GRAVEL CRUNCHING) (GATE CLICKS, CREAKING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) (SIRENS APPROACHING) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (SIRENS APPROACHING CLOSER) INTERVIEWER: Hello.
