How magnificent! She is exquisite. Shizuko returned from Italy last year. She married her patron from her schooldays. Her husband's name is Giichiro Kaito, a business tycoon. Anything on Kaito? Well, sir. He was born in 1927, so that makes him 82. His vulnerable point is... a feud with his stepbrother. The stepbrother is a schemer. He's buying up shares to take over the business. Giichiro owns 30% of the whole group. His stepbrother has 20%. How much stock went into Kaito's loan mortgage? Approximately 120,000 shares. Buy them as bait. We'll get close to the stepbrother. Also, tell Giichiro about his scheme. We'll turn them... against each other. To what ends? Until Giichiro loses everything he owns. The object of your desire won't drop into your lap. Only effort makes it precious. Shizuko. Since you were an 18-year-old girl I've been looking after you. You aspired to go to the music academy. But your father went bankrupt. And killed himself. And your mother died as if to follow him. I've been supporting you over the years. I helped you go to Italy. Uncle Giichiro, how can I ever thank you? Stop that, that's inappropriate. I didn't help you to be thanked. I did it because... "The Kaito Bankruptcy! 900 Billion in Debt!" "A Stroke!" "Giichiro Kaito, Dead!" Who are you, people? Please, don't! Why are you doing this to me? Don't... No! No... No! Don't touch me! No... Who are you? It's nothing. I got the wrong room. Wait right there. We bought the uncollectible loans Kaito owes you. So we, the Toyama Group, own his wife now. I'm taking her. Any objections? "Flower and Snake 3" So... I was saved... by you? Yes. You're mine. I'm the CEO of the Toyama Group and your new husband. I own you, unless you want to go back to those men. The choice is yours. So you don't object. Good. I have a flight to New York to catch. I'll be gone a month. My servants will look after you. Kawada, the driver, and the others. Don't worry, my second house is at a secret location. I hope you'll like it. Izawa, the butler. Orihara will teach you manners. Morita is chef and caretaker. Misae is the maid. What's wrong? Nothing... Shizuko. Put your horrible past behind you. You're safe here. The wife of the Toyama Group CEO is expected to act gracefully. Kyoko. Here. Thanks. So... You broke up with him? You were in love. Is this what you want? Shizuko. Won't you regret it? My cello is my boyfriend. Music is my husband. That's how it is. What's going on? No! What? Hey! What's wrong? You must have had a bad dream. Today's clothes are right here. Today is just another day. You're acting strange, Madam. Madam? You should rest this morning. Yes. Thank you. What was it? It's a snake... There's nothing. Madam. It's a letter from the Master. "Dear, Shizuko." "The man with you is not a butler, he's called Onigen." "I hired him for his services." "Shizuko. You'll go through many things" "before my return." "You must accept whatever happens to you." "You cannot leave my property." "If you do, you will find yourself in danger." Oh... What's this about? As the Master wrote you, Madam. Madam. Madam. Dinner is served. Now, Madam. Don't! No! Madam. This is mealtime. Sit down. What are you doing? No! Remember what the Master told you. Please don't! Somebody's watching. Nobody's watching, Madam. No! Stop it! Please don't... Please don't! Madam. You saw a movie when you were 13. Do you remember it? You told your friend about it. Do you remember it? A princess was kidnapped. She was tied up and gagged in a dark cave. She was left there helpless. And a snake crawled toward her. I heard what you told your friend about the scene. You felt like you were on fire. Madam, were you aroused? Where did you feel on fire? What a horny teenager you were! Please stop... On the contrary, things have just begun. What are you talking about? Stop them, please! Please don't! No! No! No! No! Please don't. Madam. Every night I console myself, thinking about you. I want to see what you look like down there. I want to see! That's all I could think about! I want to see! Now, Madam. You can show me everything you are hiding. No! I don't want to show you! I don't want you to look! Madam, I can see it. I can see your pussy. It's divine, Madam. No! Don't! No! Please don't... The water is still cold. If you caught a cold, I would be blamed. Who are you really? I'm here for one purpose only. To make you into an exquisite woman. What did you make me drink? A diuretic. What? Help! Don't look! Madam. You ought to clean up the mess you made all over my body... with your own tongue. Please, let me go. I can't... Look at you, Shizuko. You said you wouldn't do those things. None of those dirty things. Kyoko? Kyoko. Why are you here? I've always been by your side, Shizuko. All through high school and university. Always. You know what I'm trying to tell you? I'll tell you. I've always loved you. I know you had no idea. Music is all you ever cared about. What are you saying? You're so lovely. You haven't changed a bit. As a matter of fact, you are much... prettier. Kyoko. I always wanted to feel you. Kyoko, please... I tried to contain it. It was so hard to suppress my desire but you had no idea. You're nasty to me. It's my turn to be nasty to you, Shizuko. No. Spare me, please. I will not spare you. Don't! Please. That's enough... please. Kyoko. What are you doing? No! Please don't! No! So beautiful... So divine and horny. Let's not do this. No! Please stop this! Please. Please... Kyoko. Kyoko. Shizuko. Kyoko... No... Shizuko. I love you. Oh, Shizuko! You're so... You're a dirty whore! Don't watch me! Please don't watch me! The vichyssoise is exceptionally good this morning. Hey, boys. You can touch her. Do what you like. It feels good... How do you like it, Madam? I love it... very much. My turn! You're so beautiful, Madam. More than any other woman. Come with me. You're the one who's been watching me... It was you! Yes, indeed. I have been here all this time, watching your every move. But why? Don't you get it yet, Shizuko? I am the man who is responsible for the fall of your husband, Giichiro Kaito. It was I, who had the loan sharks abduct you. I was watching you when they violated you. I had Onigen rescue you from those men. Also, these are not my house servants at all. They work for Onigen. When I first saw you play cello at your recital your training began. My training? You accepted Kaito's tongue, then the ropes and whips with pleasure. Shizuko. This is our honeymoon night. You're so beautiful, Shizuko. Onigen. Don't! No! I'm so embarrassed. Don't look... Please don't watch me like this! You're so beautiful, Shizuko. You get turned on when things get rough. And secretly you want to be treated roughly. You're a beautiful and lecherous flower of lust. I can't stand this... Let me down, please. No... Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Shall I stop? Please... Please... I'll stop then. Oh, please... I can't hear you. Please don't... I can't hear that. Don't stop! Don't stop. Darling, please. Stop it. Everybody's watching. You don't want me? I do. Are you on fire? You want it so bad? Shizuko, speak your mind. I want it! I want you! Even if everybody's watching? Watching... It's OK. I want to be watched. I'm losing control... Give it to me now. More, harder! You hid your true lustful nature. You thought you could hide it. But Shizuko, you have to accept the fact. You're a flower of lust and pleasure. Yes, I am! So please. Help me bloom, darling. With your manhood. Help my wanton flower bloom. Please. With pleasure. Darling. Darling. Take care of the bank deal. Anything else? Chairman Toyama rarely drank alcohol. Maybe it was stress? He was drinking a lot. Is that so... Say what's on your mind. Nothing, ma'am. It's just that we lost the Chairman so suddenly... He loved to drink wine in the bathtub. Yeah, see you next week. Bye. Take care of things. As you wish, ma'am. Have a nice weekend. You're home. Let's begin.
