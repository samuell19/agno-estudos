[tense music playing] QUEENS ON THE RUN [engine revs] [women screaming] You're gonna get us killed. Say something, Marilú! Slow down! Slow down the car! [tires screeching] Give me back my mother, you bastard! [engine revving] No, no, no! [screams] - [all screaming] - [tires screeching] - Oh no. She's got the gun! - You're crazy. [woman screams] Perfection. Kids, let's go. You guys are running late! [child] Marilú, get out of the bathroom. [man] Honey, have you seen my cell phone? Who grabbed my stuff? - Kids, come on! - I have no clue where it could be. Ah! Thanks. I have a ton of meetings for the campaign today. Esteban looks strong. I think we'll win. Oh, that's great. - Did you lose something? Get back to work. - There you are. Don't forget your lunch. Did you pack your pajamas? I think so. And if Charly feeds you shrimp, don't even think about it. Remember you're allergic, my love. - [boy] I know, Mom. - No, listen, I'm on my way. Print, like, uh, 100,000 banners. - Happy anniversary. - One sec. - Today at six. Huh? - What's that? - He's cross-eyed? - [boy] Dad, I'm really late. What are you saying to me? - Out of 700 pictures... - Oh my God, what is this? - Where are you going dressed like that? - I have my pajamas here. I'm getting lunch with Emiliano. I don't think so. Go back up there and get changed. - [groans] Mom! - I never would have worn that at your age. But it's so long ago. I'm sure at my age, you were just as wild as me. - You need to chill. - What's a lap dance? It's not my fault you didn't experience more. [boy] Technically, it is your fault because you were born. [girl] You're a little jerk. Who asked you? [woman 1] It doesn't matter how old you are. Life is an adventure, and it's never too late to start over. Even as a woman, I have a masculine aspect. - [phone rings] - And we're afraid of it... [woman 2] Hey, chica. Do you remember Pili? The dyslexic girl who took that literature workshop with me? She just published a bestseller! I'm so happy for her. I'm watching it right now on the computer. [woman 2] I could be the one interviewing her right now. - Can you imagine? - [chuckles] And how are you doing with your book? Oh, you know. With Esteban's career, I don't have time. [Estrella] But you do have time for the massages, the Botox, the boobies that Esteban got for you. - [woman 3] The surgeon will see you now. - [woman 2] Thanks. Are you at the surgeon right now? Whenever you're ready. Listen. Esteban says he'll be elected governor, so I have to look spectacular. Think, Estrella, I'm going to go down in history. Your titties are gonna go down in history. See, these are things no one thinks about. - [alarm beeps] - That's my alarm. I have to rinse out the dye before it starts itching too much. - I'll call you later. Bye. - Okay, great. Bye. [woman 4] I want you to grab a hold of that fiery beast and tell all the women who are watching us right now what message you want to give them through this new book of yours. [woman 1] Every last woman has a fierce beast within, and no matter your age, you are the only person alive who can wake that sleeping lioness. Go do it. [exhales] Okay, so tell me, young lady... [dog barks] It looks amazing. Oh, she's a vision in pink, huh? Ramiro, where are you? If we want to get pregnant, we gotta get busy. Now. I'm right here. Don't worry, I'm here. I snuck out of the office. I have 15 minutes. - That's fine. We'll do it in three. - Okay. Okay. [Ramiro groans] Okay. Quickly, quickly, quickly. Sexy, sexy, sexy. - Horny, horny. - Fifteen minutes, here we go. - [grunts] Oh yeah. - Okay. - That's it, baby. - I gotta focus. I need a few minutes. - Think about my body. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, I like those. - Yeah? You like these? What else do you like? Uh, I like... [grunts] - [groans] - What else? - Uh, your... your eyes. - [moans] Yeah? - Your eyes are so much like... - Uh-huh? So much like your mom's. What? I can't. - Uh, sorry, babe, I... I can't. - Why? Why? You wanna know why? Look at the urn. Look at the pictures. Look. [spluttering] I feel like your mom is watching us bang from beyond the grave. Oh my God. Just forget about my mom. What do you need, huh? This? Huh? Yeah. [moans] - Does it help? You like that? - Yeah, maybe. Yes. - Okay, get those pants off. [grunts] - [grunts] - Yeah. - [grunts] Let's do it. [groans] [grunting] [Famela gasps] - [Ramiro] Oh God! - Mom! - No, you kicked my mom! - Oh my God. - I didn't mean it. - Oh, no, Mommy. Sorry. You can't be serious. - Oh, Mommy. - Yeah, hey. - Oh, no, poor thing. - No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, okay. Okay. - Honey, I gotta go. - What? Yeah, I left some documents at José's house. And we have a meeting with, uh, with Esteban in half an hour. At this rate, we're never getting pregnant. I'm sorry, baby. You know how much I love you. You've got my mom on your forehead. Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, Mom. Bye. [door closes] [Paty] They're completely different. My husband noticed this one goes north. This one goes south. This one's hard. This one's floppy. You have to fix them, doctor. The disparity is a completely natural part of our bodies, Paty. But in my boobies?! You see this? I mean it's flopping all over the place. - You can put the ice on. - Ugh. Well, we could even them out a bit with a hyaluronic acid implant. - It just hit the market. - Uh, okay. But I'm not allowed to release it until December. No! Not until December? No, please. The elections are in two months. Well, the last one in your size is with my colleague in Mérida. - What colleague? - I'm not sending you to my competition. Oh, doctor, couldn't you just... [screams] - No. - [receptionist] Doctor Claudio? - We kinda overdid it with the Botox. - [receptionist] Can you come here? - My mouth. - It will deflate in no time. You look beautiful. Give me a minute. Oh, doctor, which colleague has those implants? [Claudio] Paty, I already told you. It's confidential. - [door closes] - [sighs] [intriguing music playing] [doctor speaking indistinctly] - [tablet beeping] - [groans] [bell dings] [music intensifies] [tablet chimes] [gasps] [island music playing] Estrella, nice to meet you. But you can call me Star. Uh, you look a little different from your photos. [laughs] Well, yeah, I dyed my hair. [laughs] I know what you're thinking. You're over there wondering if the carpet matches the drapes. - [chuckles] - [laughs] - What are you drinking? - [slurps] - A lemonade. - A lemonade? Oh, you kids nowadays. [Estrella whistles] Can you bring us some rainbows? - You got it. - [Estrella] Thanks, you. [hesitates] Okay. Okay. So what are we celebrating? The most memorable day of your whole life. [man] The documents are right inside. Ask Marilú. - Okay, I just got here. - Bye. Okay. Okay, okay. [dog barking] COME IN... [suspenseful music playing] Hello? [grunts] [woman] I'll be right out. Take a seat on the couch. [sighs] [traditional percussive music playing] Shh. Not a word, Ali Baba. Don't move. - Happy anniversary, my love. - Huh? [gulps] - Oh. - Ramiro! - What are you doing here? - I'm here to get some documents from José. - Why didn't you say so? - It wasn't my fault. Get out of my house before I ram these high heels straight up your ass. Ah! Ow. You hit me in the eye. [music ends] - [doorbell ringing] - [footsteps approaching] Welcome. - I brought wine. - Why is this bottle already half empty? [Estrella] I don't know. Listen, Ramiro's shy. - That's why he didn't stop you. - I'm so embarrassed. Don't get ideas. God, what happened? - Too much Botox. - What's with your lips? - They're gonna deflate. - Yeah, sure they will. [Paty] What's the plan? The plan is wine, snacks, and crying for the old times' sake. [women laughing] I wish I went to high school with you guys. [Marilú] We had so much fun. Look at us before we were full of responsibilities and stretch marks. Don't forget cellulite. - Remember that trip we wanted to take? - [Marilú] Ah, yes. What trip? We wanted to go on a road trip to runaway without telling our families. Hey, that sounds so cool! But then came marriage, husbands, the children. Okay, speak for yourself. [Marilú] So many memories! [exhales] - [Estrella] Is that the to-do list? - [Paty] Let's see. Listen to this, "Go to the beach, do a striptease." [laughs] - Check. - Oh, "Hitchhike." - "Rescue animals, try to get high." - [dog barks] - [screams] "Be rebels." - [Marilú] Be rebels. "Declare my love to Antonio Posadas." Who's Antonio Posadas? - Oh! Antonio Posadas. - Posadas! Only Marilú's hot ex-boyfriend. She was gonna marry him before José. His family had tons of money. They owned a hotel chain. I don't remember which one. - What happened? - [groans] He really broke my heart so bad. One summer we fought then he was just gone. - I wrote him, but he disappeared. - Never. Last I heard, he was living in the United States. - Other than that, there was nothing. - Nothing. Come on, aren't you a little curious? - You can find anyone now. - I mean, I never... - No, never. - Here, I'm gonna look him up now. What was his name? [all] Antonio Posadas Cervantes. [laughing] - Antonio Posadas Cervantes. - That's right. - Uh, ah-ha! Here he is. - Let me see that. Owner of the chains Fiesta Americana, Live Aqua. He makes donations to charity which means he's a good person. No, not always. Not all that glitters is gold. He's available. It says he's divorced, no kids. Let's take a look at his Instagram. - [Marilú] Let's see. - Oh, look at the puppy! Oh! [all] Aw. [all] Oh! Damn. - Marilú, you're kidding me! - He wasn't like that. - Hold up, listen to this. - [laughs] It says that this weekend he'll be at a conference in Cancún in one of his hotels. [grunts] Let's go. - Back up a second. Are you serious? - Yes. - We don't have to go for him. - Uh-huh. We do owe ourselves a road trip last I checked. Yes, fuck the husbands. They won't even know about it. And if we happen to go by Mérida for the implants... No, come on, you're beautiful. It's not a bad idea. I could scatter my mom's ashes in the Caribbean. - Just like she wanted. - [all] Yes! We're breaking free from the mommy issues. Yeah! Fuck it! This is exactly what we need right now. Come on, where's my drink? Let's have a fucking adventure for the moms. - I mean, for a mom. - Mm-hm. - And no husbands, no kids, with nothing. - Yeah. Yeah! Let's go naked! - Hm, I don't think so. - Naked? Why would we be naked? Because we can be. Because we can be. - Hey, what's going on? - [daughter] Hi, mom, how are you? - You had a fight with Pedrito? About what? - No, no. - What? - Do I need to come get you? - No, why? - Of course, honey. I'll be right there. What? No, no... [sighs] It looks like I gotta run. - What are you talking about? - What about our trip to Cancún. You can't leave yet. - Aren't you excited? - You really mean it? - What about the kids? - Let your husband take 'em. Let's take a vote. Who's up for an adventure the day after tomorrow without telling anyone. - Are you serious? - [Paty laughs] - Are we really doing the hand thing? - Always. - Yeah, get your hand in here. Hurry up. - Okay. Okay, okay. We're doing this? Yeah, get in here. Let him know you're serious about the divorce. - What divorce? - What divorce? Famela! [inhales sharply] That was just a conversation we had. Really? - Right. That was a secret. Sorry. - Which divorce, Marilú? You're getting a divorce? - No. - Are you all right? No, we're not doing that good. It's the third year he's forgotten our anniversary. - Oh, no way. - Oh, We need to send a message, Mari. - [Famela] Jeez. - Yeah, oh my God. It's not a big deal. I'm fine. Now I should go. I'm sure José is waiting for me with puppy-dog eyes while... - Why didn't you tell me? - Shh. I love you guys. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Why didn't you tell us sooner? - Because I'm a good friend. [door closes] - Well, we're still going, aren't we? - Obviously. - Obviously. - Yeah, of course. We're not doing the hand again. - You're a great secret keeper, huh? - If she gets divorced, I'm screwed. You've been screwed for years. [light instrumental music playing] [exhales] [reporter] We're coming to you live from one of the illegal distribution centers being dismantled today. It operated under the control of the mysterious businessman known as El Gavilán. This is believed to be one of the most powerful sources of revenue operating within the city. Authorities have been unable to locate the whereabouts of the notorious human trafficker and arms dealer. His network is said to be spread throughout the southeast of the country. - [Paty] Honey. - Yeah? Do you notice anything different? Did you get a haircut? I shaved it off, and I spent 200,000 grand on the credit card. That's great, babe. Hey, which one looks best? The one with your eyes crossed. - What do you mean "crossed"? - [laughs] No. Holy shit. - I look cross... [exhales] - [laughing] I look cross-eyed! - Yeah, you look cross-eyed. [laughs] - [sighs] - Anyway... - [line ringing] I saw the surgeon today. - [exhales] - Hello! That's good. Just make sure they finally match. José, go back to the office and print the one with the baby. [José] Why? [Esteban] I look cross-eyed in the other one, idiot. Esteban, what are you doing? I showed you them earlier, babe. You could've told me. - Oh, now it's my fault? - Like you're so busy, huh? - [Esteban sighs] - [groans] What? Why are you making that scary face? I'm not making any face. I'm actually trying to frown right now, but since the Botox, it won't... it won't let me. Where are you going, Esteban? Esteban, look at me. Look at me. - I'm looking at you. - I wanna ask you something. Did you... Is it the puppy? Are you really still on that? I told you we can't have one right now. That's it. I have to go to the office to supervise José because apparently I have to do everything myself. [José grunts] - I'm surrounded by idiots. - [door opens] [Ramiro] "What communication boils down to essentially is respect." "Can we respect our partners enough to listen to them?" "Listening can be a radical act where new possibilities and new relationship paradigms can be articulated." [clicks tongue] Ramiro. I'm gonna go scatter the ashes for my mom. Oh, thank God. When are we leaving? No, I'm going with the girls to Cancún, but I think it's finally time to say goodbye to her. What do you think? I think it's time for us to have a little more time together. Yeah, time to get pregnant. [sighs] Well, yeah, time to get pregnant, But before we get pregnant, why don't we take some time to enjoy each other a bit more? - More? - Yeah, more. You were with your mother for the first two years of our marriage. And that's understandable. She was sick and all. But we weren't going anywhere without her. - [scoffs] - And now that she's gone, we could think about traveling. - You know, romance. - [groans] Romance. Ugh. No, not again with the romance thing. I'm not a fucking romantic. Fine. I'm listening. Tell me what you want. - Some time... with you. - Uh-huh. Okay. You're busy at work, and all the time you do have is for banging. It's always boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and that's it. Gone. I stay like this. Looking up at the ceiling. I don't know. I feel sorta used. That's the truth. Uh-huh. You're not gonna cry? You see? - Don't laugh. You don't care about me. - [laughs] For a long time, I've felt like you don't care, like I'm an accessory. Okay, here. And now you're about to go on this road trip with your friends. Yeah, we're going to scatter my mother's ashes. - Isn't that what you wanted? - Yes. - Yes, that's what I want. - I do listen to you. I always listen to you, hon. I always listen to you. - I always listen, right? - Yeah. We're going away this weekend, but you can't tell Esteban or José. - It's a secret. Promise me. Do it. - [sighs] Pinky. No, I don't need the pinky. Promise me. - [exhales] Promise. - Okay. If you tell them, I'll cut off your balls. [alarm clock beeping] MARILÚ - WHERE ARE YOU? MARILÚ - GIRLS...

[Marilú] Her name is Famela. Hey, how come you guys aren't flying? - Because of the chicken? - Oh, his name is Kentucky. - [Lola] That's nice. - [Marilú] We're taking a road trip. [Lola] Four housewives on a road trip by themselves? - [all] Four housewives? - That's kinda dangerous. Everyone says it's dangerous. The cop said the same thing. Who are you calling a cop? He was more than that. - An officer chiseled out of pure bronze. - That's true. Just thinking about him gives me goosebumps. Officer Roberto Martínez. Roberto Martínez? [Paty] Do you know him? No, I just think it sounds like a soap opera, right? Like... "What do you want, Roberto Martínez?" Ah! [laughs] Hey, what if you sped up? I want to see what the engine's got, feel the wind in my hair, you know? - Are you in a hurry? - I have a very important audition. - Really? - I'm a dancer. - Think you can keep up with us housewives? - Yes. - No, Famela. No! - Yeah! Oh my God. ♪ I'm feeling good, how about you? ♪ Hi. [laughing] [phone chiming] No. No. I'm with some ladies who are traveling alone. I'll take a few tamales. Hm. Maybe I'll take 'em all. [sighs] Calm down. No, don't worry. They don't suspect a thing. [Marilú] I hope you feel stupid for judging her. She's clearly just a dancer. Yeah, a stripper. Thank you. [Marilú] No, she's not. - Can you put this in my purse? - Is Kentucky thirsty? He looks a little dehydrated. Holy Mary, Mother of God. - Why are you carrying a gun? - For safety. - These are pretty good, aren't they? - [machine beeps] - I just work here. - Excuse me. - Imagine if the policeman had found it. - Nope. No. - No, no. - He didn't. [both] Give it to me, Marilú. - Uh... - Hey, what... [groans] - No, okay, stop! - Somebody's crazy. - [Famela] Give me the gun. - I'm throwing it away. This can't happen. A politician's wife can't be seen... Yes, um, I'll call you when I get to town. No, it's too dangerous. It would be used eventually. - I've gotta go. - [Famela] Give it to me. - Let go. - Give it to me. [slow motion] Hey, girls! [slow motion] Give me the damn gun! I bought tamales! [screams] - [alarm blaring] - [gasps] - [Famela gasps] - What have I done? - Please don't be dead. - Jesus! Christ! Oh God. Oh my God. - Estrella, are you... - I'm okay. Officer? Yes, the store is under attack. Thanks for saving my life, my angel. - Why are you doing with a fucking gun? - It's Famela's. Take back your devil gun. - [gun fires] - [all scream] Yes, they have weapons. [Paty] Run, run! Get in now! - I don't know. It's a red convertible. - [car engine revving] - [tires screeching] - [Paty] Hold on. Kentucky! Oh my God, what are you doing over there, baby? Come here, little one. Come here. - That's it, sweetheart. - [Kentucky clucks] [tires screeching] Nobody touches my gun again. Forget what happened. It stays here. You got that? Oh, cheer up, girls. I survived, didn't I? Fortunately, shorty here saved me. Does anyone want a little tamale for their nerves? - Yeah, give me one. - Pass me one. [Paty laughs] [Estrella] Well, hello there. Estrella, nice to meet you. [Lola] Let me say goodbye quick. I'm late for my audition. [Paty] Oh, I need to stretch. - [Lola] Bye. - Break a leg. Hey, here. Take the tamales with you. My little angel. [Paty] Good luck with your audition. Bye. [door closes] Mm. [groans] I'm exhausted. Maybe we should just call it a night. [chuckles] What do you mean? I can sleep when I'm dead. God damn, Marilú. You have such a little waist in that dress. I hate you. I promise I can barely breathe in this thing. - [Paty] Say hello. - To my little friend. [all] Oh! - Hello. - Hello. [all scream] [laughing] You bitches ready to take this town by storm? Yes! Hey, this would be a perfect moment for some slow motion. - What? - Wait, what slow motion? Like in the movies. I'd film this moment like this in slow motion. - Oh, Patty. - Ready now. Lights, camera, action. [Famela] Patricia, you okay? There goes the other one. Whoa. You've gotta try it. It's amazing. Oh no. Go. Sass.

This network ruthless human traffickers is led by a man they call El Gavilán. Oh God. I even managed to get puke under my titties. - Come here a sec. - [laughs] So gross. Does it still smell? Oh yeah. A little bit. Yuck. [sniffs, retches] - [exhales] - [Marilú groans] Did you imagine your life would turn out this way? Yeah. It's much better than I imagined, actually. [chuckles] - [Kentucky clucking] - I can't believe we have a chicken. I can't believe we have a gun either. - The chicken is the trip's mascot. - [Kentucky clucks] Ramiro's gonna crack up when you tell him. Or he might just be upset with me because before I left for the trip, he said he wanted us to spend more time alone before having kids because I spent all my time with my mom. Mm, well, that's true. - No... - Yes, it is. I mean, you spent your honeymoon with your mom. Please. She just got carried away. All the alcohol that woman drank, it's no wonder. I guess I mean, do you ever imagine what would've happened if you'd made other decision? For example, if I had married Antonio. When I see him, I want to ask him what happened. Why did you disappear like that? - But you know... - I'm so nervous. You don't have to see him if you don't want. I mean, Antonio is not the point. But he kind of is the point because when José pisses me off, all I can I think is, "If you only knew about the hunk I used to be with." - Your husband is your priority. - [laughs] He keeps saying I'm bossy. And that he feels used. [scoffs] I'm sorry, but I agree. You are bossy. - That's why you're not pregnant. - Mm. Because your testosterone is way up here. Twenty years ago, I got married to José. [chuckles] We thought it was happily ever after. [chuckles] Remember how he used to sing those songs for me? - [chuckles] Horrible songs. - [laughs] Yes, they were horrible, but I was his princess. - I swear, I can't give up control. - [laughs] I mean, if I have to hang a painting, I hang it myself. - I don't wait for him to hang it. - No, Famela, no. If you have to hang a picture, you tell him, "Baby, darling, I need some help over here." - Oh God. - Look him in the eye and tell him, "Oh, it's just I go crazy when you drive that nail in." - "With that hammer." - "Oh, hammer." "Because I'm so helpless, so useless and fragile." "Super fragile like Mario's princess." - "Help me, protect me." - "Help." "Protect me. Protect me, you bastard." - Oh. - I mean... [scoffs] Being feminine doesn't necessarily mean being fragile. There's plenty of other women like me. - And that's fine. - Mm-hm. I was his princess then. And now I'm the housewife, the mother, the nanny. The nurse, the cook. Okay, then tell me who you are when you're not being any of them. [chuckles] I don't know, uh, it's crazy. I don't know. Then why are you waiting for your husband to define you? Sure, what he gave you was what made you feel alive, But I wanna know is... what you give you. Then how are you going to make him feel like your hero, your king? Okay, but why would I want him to be my king? - Mm. - So he can be king of everyone? Like Esteban? No, thank you. It was comedy. You made it drama. I'm sorry, but how many times has he cheated on you, Paty? Four... and a half. Mm. And you're still getting implants. That's what makes me so angry for us women. That we have to accept men as they come, the full package. Beer bellies, bald head, hairy legs, no money, We, on the other hand... Well, society, both men and women, which is the fucked up thing. Yeah, it's rough. We all force ourselves to look spectacular for them. That's why you are getting these new boobs that you really don't need. What you need to do is leave him. Sorry, I said it. And you don't want somebody to cuddle up with every night? - Get married? - [sighs] Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Listen, I have plenty of people to cuddle me. I'm being serious. Don't you think it's time you... you grew up as a woman? I do love him, and I do believe that he can change. Oh, Paty, this isn't a movie. And if it were the movie of your life, would you like to be the main character or the background extra? Because that's what you're being right now. And what am I gonna do? - What are you gonna do? - Mm-hm. You are an amazing writer. There's more to being a woman than marriage and children. I've made my choice. You grow up, Mari. It takes mature grapes to make wine. - Or pineapple for tepache. - [laughs] Hey, I'm thirsty. Do you want something? - Mm-hm. [chuckles] - Huh? Hey, where did this suitcase come from? Is it yours? Wait, wasn't that one Lola's? - Hm. - [gasps] - No, we can't open it. - Sure, we can. It's in our room. It's ours now. [knocking at door] [Paty] Oh God.

I know, yeah. [Paty] And how long have you been together? [Nala] Seven, I think. Maybe nine. Years? Lives. - Wow. - [Joy chuckles] How have you lasted so long? You must accept your partner as they are. - The problem is always expectations. - Expectations. You expect him to do something, and if he doesn't do it, you feel unhappy. When it's we who should be in charge of our own happiness. [laughing] I'm not on this Earth to rescue Nala. Nor am I to compliment you. Oh, that's so romantic, you. [Marilú] This is so good, Nala.

[Joy] We added you on Instagram. - [Famela] Thank you. - [Joy] Stay in touch. - Okay, bye. - Thank you. - Bye! - Thanks for the clothes, Nala. Bye, Nala. Bye, Joy. - [Joy] Bye. - [Paty] Namaste! [Joy] Kentucky shall protect us! [Marilú] Can you explain what we're doing in Valladolid? - I'm going to rescue my mom. - What's that? - [tense music playing] - [tires screeching] [all] No shit! [Marilú] Famela, you're crazy. - Take us there. Now. - [driver] No, I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. - Marilú, stop her. Not again. - [driver] Don't go back there. - [Marilú] What are you... - [Famela] Get in. Don't you pop anything. The flamingo is expensive. - [Marilú] What are we doing? - Get in. [Marilú] Famela. - [Famela] Okay. Go, go, go. Let's move it. - Goddammit. [Estrella] What's your plan, Famela? Blow up the place? [Marilú] Are you sure about this? [Famela] Yes, I am. You stop questioning me. ["Storm" by Vivaldi playing] - [woman] Let me in. I'm gonna puke. - You good? This is the fucking tamales you gave us. [women retching] [woman retching] - Sorry, Godfather, the girls got sick. - Look. You promised me girls for El Gavilán. I don't know where you have to get them, but you're gonna get them. Otherwise, you and I are both dead. You have an hour. [indistinct chatter] - Where the hell am I gonna get... - [man] Hey. - Don't touch me. - Don't touch her. - Guys, there's still time. - Where is he hiding? - [Famela] We're already here. - [Paty] Do we have a plan or... [Estrella] Don't touch her. [Paty] I have a bad feeling about this. Ah, girls, what are you doing here? Lola? [Estrella] My guardian angel! A better question is, why are you here? - Yes, that's a coincidence, right? - [Famela] Uh-huh, uh-huh. Because we ran into her just before we were assaulted on the road, remember? Yes. So that's it. You must have tipped them off. You told El Gavilán we were coming. El Gavilán? - Yeah. - Yeah. You crossed paths with El Gavilán? This is El Gavilán. He's a notorious arms dealer and human trafficker. His network spreads throughout the entire southeast of the country. I'm part of a secret operation coordinated with the DEA. My objective: to catch men like El Gavilán. Let me introduce myself again. My name is Rosa María Betsabé Ximena Hernández de la Garza y Garza. But my colleagues call me Lola. Commander Lola. Whoa. - [Lola] El Gavilán is accused of robbery... - What? ...arms trafficking, and worst of all, kidnapping young girls who are never seen again. [Estrella] Oh my God. I'm here because El Gavilán is coming to the show tonight. I recruited some women to distract him by dancing, but they got sick. COVID? Diarrhea. Gas station tamales. - Oh, no. Those are the worst. - [Estrella] Those fucked us up too. - [Paty] Oh my God. That was awful. - Real bad. There must be something we can do. I mean, we've all met this guy before, right? - [hesitating] - [Estrella] What? No. No way. Come on, what's your idea? Well you could dress up as strippers yourselves. - Whoa! - [Estrella laughs] You mean us? - Oh, no. That's crazy. - [Marilú] Seriously? - Us. - [Lola] Why not? Did I mention there was a five million-dollar reward for his capture? [Estrella] Five million dollars? [Lola] Without dancers, I have to cancel the show. And without the show, we lose El Gavilán. You know, I did take pole dancing lessons. But hold on, isn't this guy super, hyper, mega dangerous? There is a risk. But if we can pull this off, we'll put a stop to him forever. [Estrella] Yeah, but we could get killed. Murdered. I would do anything to take that bastard down. The commander did save your life. DON'T OVERTHINK IT All right, then. How slutty do you want us to be? [audience applauding, cheering] DO A STRIPTEASE ["Eyes on Me" by Barovier playing] [audience cheers] What do you think? ["Eyes on Me" continues] Here, come with me. Your table is ready. That's Tuerto on the right. [audience chanting indistinctly] El Gavilán is behind him. Ready? Let's get him. [yelling] [Famela] Stand your ass up, or I'll turn it into Swiss cheese. I was hoping I'd see you again, little rebel. - [grunts] - Be a good boy, Gavilán. ♪ Look at me go ♪ - [man] How you doin', boss? - Great. - Hey. - Are you taking off? - [Estrella] Your gun's so big. - Where's your office? - [man] Want anything to drink? - [Estrella] Hello. Say a word, and I'll shoot you. Keep quiet and walk, asshole. [Lola] Drink with us. Ladies, yeah. Tell me where you're keeping my mom, you bastard. You're fucked now, Gavilán. I'd advise you to stop this little game now and to go back to where you came from. - Now what do we do, Lola? - [Lola] We get him out of here. - [Marilú] What? How? - [Lola] Just find the ashes. I'll look get the others. [cell phone chimes, vibrates] Are you seriously on Tinder right now? What are you doing? - Just one little wad of bills. - [Famela] Hey! Estrella, you need to put it down. - Okay, I'm doing it. - [Famela] Put it down. Right now. Drop it! There. Are you happy? Not just stealing boyfriends anymore? You were never gonna marry him. [Marilú] How do you know? They were my emails from my boyfriend, which you deleted because you liked him. Antonio was wrong for you, Marilú. [Marilú] Oh, is that what you think? I still regret breaking up. [groans] Why did you guys break up? [sighs] A stupid fight. I got jealous of his best friend, Teresa. But I never heard from him again because this Judas blocked him. It's because he hit on me, okay? Hm? [Famela] What? [El Gavilán] Oh! No, he didn't, you liar. The asshole tried to kiss me one time. And obviously, I couldn't tell you. - Because you'd think it was bullshit. - Obviously. Okay, how about we discuss this some other time, yeah? And then I found out that he was cheating on you with Teresa. Why didn't you say anything? Because you wouldn't have believed me. [soft instrumental music playing] I couldn't let you marry him. I'm sorry, Marilú. And why wouldn't I believe my best friend, you big dummy? [El Gavilán] Well, look at that. What a tender display. The mop head has a heart after all. I can see crocodile tears flowing, like the eyes of some feathered serpent. Don't mess with my friends, you dick-faced asshole. - You fucking bastard! - [groans] [gasps] Oh my! - That's right, bitch. Hell yeah! - [cell phone ringing] You, turn off that cell phone right now! And you, you tell me where my mother is, or I'll blow your fucking brains out, asshole. We have your mother in my safe. - [gun firing] - [all screaming] You better drop the gun if you wanna save your friend. [El Gavilán] Perhaps you know each other. [tense music playing] I said drop your guns now! I'm sorry. They got Paty. Untie him, Famela. [chuckles] [Tuerto] All right, hurry up. Get over here. - Back to back. - [Paty screams] [Tuerto] That's it. That's a good girl. How tragic that things have come to this. But I'm afraid now I'll have to kill you all. Please, no, don't. I'm warning you my husband knows the president. That makes two of us. - [cell phone chiming] - [Estrella] Dear Lord, please... ...Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Dear Lord, please watch over us. - [cell phone chiming] Things could have been so beautiful between us. - [cell phone chiming] - [El Gavilán yells] Goddammit, will somebody turn off that fucking cell phone? [whimpering] [cell phone chimes] [cell phone chimes] Where? [Estrella whimpers] [cell phone chimes, vibrates] [Estrella winces] [El Gavilán] Here it is. Bumble. [laughs] Oh my goodness. What does this gentleman have to say? "You should ask El Gavilán who made Tuerto one-eyed." - [metal thuds] - [all screaming] [Roberto] Police! Drop your weapons. Split up in two groups! Move! Move! - Two guys on your right. - [Paty screams] [Lola] Bobby, gun! [Roberto] Heads up. To the left. Go. We're clear here. Go forward. Clear! [Famela] Paty, my mother is in the safe. Estrella! Estrella! The guns! What? [policeman] Come on! Come out. You're surrounded! [Marilú] Grab a gun! [guns firing] - I got one. - Now go shoot. No. Then give me one. You go left, Lola. [music intensifying] [guns firing] [Lola grunts] Oh, the safe. Right, the safe. Gavilán. Try. G is four. A is three. V is eight. [grunts] [Roberto] Over on the right. You guys to the left, go. [Marilú] Come on, throw me the gun. Throw as far as you can! [Estrella] Sorry. [Marilú] Get another one. [gasps] There's another safe. Okay. [policeman] Come on out if you're on the rebels' side. Move, move. [laughs] Okay. No, no. [Famela] Paty, over here. Famela, I got her. It's mine. [laughs] Hey! Asshole! - [man] Hey, there you are. - [screams] Hey, what the hell? [grunts] [Famela] Give me back my mother, asshole! Let her go! [guns firing] Throw it hard! Hurry! - Come on. Come on. - [Estrella] Sorry. - [grunts] - [panting] Oh, do you want to play? [Paty yells] Ha! [man 1 grunts] I want my mom back, you bastard! - Estrella. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - [Paty grunts] - [groans] [man 2] Hey, you! [man 2 grunts] Yeah! [laughs] No! [grunting] No, no, no, no! - [Paty yells] - [shouts] [Roberto] Ladies. We're coming to help you. [Lola grunting] Who is the weaker sex now, bitch? Hm. Let go of my mother! [Tuerto] Looking for this? Oh, you're a badass, huh? If you shoot, I'll drop these. I'll drop these. No, Marilú. No, no. No, Marilú. Stop it. Marilú. Don't you move. - Ah, now say goodbye to mama. - No! Oh! No! Blessed art thou among women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. [groans] [exhales] [panting] [El Gavilán winces] Where you going, you dirty bird? Okay, take it easy, princess. [groans] We're queens, you asshole. Yeah. Queens, bitch. [groans] [policeman] We got nothing on this end. All clear. [indistinct chatter] - Deputy. - [man] Esteban. - Future governor. - Good to see you. Thank you very much for your help and discretion. [deputy] Always a pleasure. [Carlos] Dad, I'm starving. [reporter] These brave strippers helped organize a sting operation against El Gavilán alongside Commander Jiménez... Hey, excuse me, can you turn it up? [Lola] It was all thanks to them. [Paty] I want to say something. Just please. It's true that I'm married to candidate Esteban Sosa. And if he's watching, I wanna say he can fuck off to hell. [yells] Don't vote for him. Because everything about the man is a lie. That's all. [reporter] These are strippers against drug trafficking. ...TELLS CANDIDATE TO F*** OFF: "EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM IS A LIE" So what came out when my boob exploded is called hyaluronic acid. If you get it in your eyes, it'll burn like hell. - [policeman] Clear the area. - [helicopter blades whirring] [woman coughing] Hey, there. My Star. Thank you. Without your message, we never would've caught these guys. Just a thank you? [chuckles] [romantic music playing] [Estrella] Marilú, I can't believe you still wanna see Antonio Posadas after everything. [Marilú] We've come this far, haven't we? I have to make peace with this once and for all. [Estrella] I'm dying of curiosity. - [all laughing] - Right there. - Come on, girls. - Let's go, girls! - This way. Please follow me. - Yeah. [chuckles] Go, go. Absolutely... [light instrumental music playing] [indistinct conversation] [chuckles] CONFESS MY LOVE TO ANTONIO POSADAS [Famela] What happened?
