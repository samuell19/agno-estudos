Uhh! >> D, old man. >> Angel's rule! >> What the hell is that? >> Let's take them out. [car horn blaring] >> Smooth, like you. I'll be proud to own it. >> You can, Eddie, and it'll make you look good. >> It's worth every penny they're asking. Give them 25%, of what they want. >> Baby, they won't sell it at that price. >> They'll take what I give to them, or I'll take it from them for nothing. [knocking on door]Angel, see who that is please. What is this? Didn't the old man show? What happened? >> Oh yeah, he showed. >> Didn't he have the goods? >> Yeah, he had the goods. >> Well, then what happened? >> Well uh, we did the old man like you wanted. Then a bunch of these Black Angels showed up. I don't know where the hell they came from. And then the next thing I know I woke up and the blow was gone. >> They took my cocaine? Those do gooders. You know where angels come from? Send them there. And don't screw up this time. What are you waiting for, go do it. >> Yeah, tonight, and make sure you've got the cash this time. >> Hey man, how's it going? >> What do you mean it's this town, I don't do any favours, what are you going to do for me?>> Yeah I can deliver it no problem, okay I'll see you there. >> Mr. Smith, how you doing?

Aren't you going to count it? >> What for, isn't it all here? >> Glad you have so much faith in me man. >> Listen, I got to tell you right now, there's a bit of heat in the area, so I don't want you carrying very much around, in the next little while okay? >> Well, how am I going to deal? >> You got a burgundy Buick parked in the laneway behind Jake's house. From now on your supply is going to be in the glove box, until I tell you different. >> No problem. >> Listen, if things go right this week, there's going to be more for you next week, you look at it like a promotion. >> Yeah, it sounds great. >> When you go out, Ralph will give you the keys, okay? >> Okay, but right now I need a few grams. >> Well he'll fix you up, tell him I said so all right, go out there and do some hustling. >> All right. [blues music] >> Ralph, what's up man?>> How are you man? Here's the keys Eddie told me to give you. What are they for anyways? >> A fuckin Ferrari, like I'd be caught dead driving anything else? So Eddie said you could fix me up with a couple of gram, how about it? >> Sure, you got cash? >> Of course.>> All right. >> Beautiful.>> All right. Hey I hear you and Tony are going to be doing some heavy distribution. >> Well I wouldn't exactly call it that heavy. >> Yeah, well, just don't forget about your friends at the bottom. >> If that means you, you can fuckin count on it. >> Fuckin asshole. >> Hey, pick on someone your own size, like me. Hey Johnny man how's it going, long time no see. >> Johnny what's up?>> How you doing guys? >> Hey Johnny, I just saw Ralph, he told me to tell you to come to the club tonight, we're celebrating man, we kicked ass at the track.

To find out why you haven't been making any money for me. Do you have a personal problem, or are you just fucking the dog? Do you have a personal problem? >> No Eddie.>> Well that can only mean that you're fucking the dog. Now Johnny doesn't fuck the dog. >> I'm sorry, it won't happen again. >> I know it won't, goodbye, >> Yo, homey, what's up man? >> What do you think, man. You're debts motherfucker. >> Hey come on man, I always pay my debts. >> Man since two fuckin weeks you ain't payed me shit. >> I'm telling you man. >> That's right, I am telling you.

[gun firing] [tires screeching] >> What's this, what's your problem? What the hell do you want? >> It's like this, your brother screwed up things for Eddie Vegas real bad.

Come on, come on. >> Freeze asshole. >> Get out of the fuckin car bitch. [women screaming]Move! [women screaming] [gun firing] >> Do him, do him. [gun firing] >> Four brutal murders in a couple of days. I mean, what the hell is going on here? Pete I want to have answers, and I want to have them now. >> Well the word on the street is that the old man who was killed was a supplier to Eddie Vegas. >> Eddie Vegas, it figures. And what about the others? >> Well, we don't know if there's any connection between that and the Black Angel killings. >> Well look it, I want extra men put on Vegas and his whole crew. I want that prick caught red handed, you hear me. And if that means you got to put somebody on him 24 hours then do it, I'll find the budget. Matter of fact, I want all of his men constantly harassed, you hear me, and bring one of those Black Angels in here, I want to talk to them, maybe get some information. Well go ahead, get on it. >> Yes sir.[phone ringing] >> Hello. Yeah okay, well while I've got you, get me the one four, will ya. Yeah, I want to talk to the chief there.

What do you think, it grows on trees? >> What'd you get for me? >> I got you an eight ball, but it's gonna cost you a bit more. It cost me a bit more. >> Look, we don't have more, this ain't cool. Who do you think you're dealing with? >> First you make us wait, then you try to rip us off, give it to me man, now. >> Hey I don't need this, all right? You guys drop the attitude or you're not getting anything from me.>> Well give it to us asshole, or we're going to have to kill you, all right?>> Listen to me man, I'm going to make sure no one fuckin sells to you guys from now on, you know what, go fuck yourselves. >> Give it to me man, now. >> Cut him man, teach this guy a lesson. >> Hey man, chill out >> Hey Johnny, what the hell's going on here? >> Okay, get him off me man. >> Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? You're ruining my business. >> You wanna put the cuffs on me? Huh? >> Hey you know, you know, you punks are always coming around, scaring my good customers. >> Fuck off. >> Hi Johnny, you hungry, I made dinner. >> It all depends what's being served. Ooh! All right, I'll stay. So, how was work today? >> Well you know, not much changes at work. Mr. Tanner took me out for lunch today. >> That sounds serious, does he have a crush on you or something? >> No, but, I think he's going to offer me a promotion. It kinda leaked out at work that there's an opening in management. Well I haven't got it or anything yet, you know, but, yeah it looks good, you know. >> It's amazing, that my sister's going to be a manager. >> You know if it works out, maybe I can get you a job there. >> No, I don't think so. >> Will you at least consider a job there if I get you one? >> Maybe, okay. >> Johnny, how's it going, how you doin man? >> Hey Johnny, Paul what's up? >> Johnny we heard you got into it with Rivet and Turtle, Ralphy was telling us. >> Those guys are fucking crazy, man. I think the hard stuff's getting to them, that's for sure. >> Hey Johnny. >> Hi Flower, how you doing? >> Adam nine five zero zero three. >> Where'd you get the black, that's been dry forever. >> Bought it from Tony, he's got plenty. >> Really. >> Let's go. >> So you guy's lookin for smoke or what? >> Of course Johnny, what do you think. >> Yeah, right on. >> Hold it right there. >> Let's get out of here. >> Come on get back here. Come on punk. >> Ahh, I got you now.>> Get off of me man. >> Let go of me man, let go of me.>> Gotcha Johnny. [phone ringing] >> Come on, let's go. >> Cuppa coffee Johnny? >> No thanks. >> Sit down, Johnny. >> No thanks. >> So, how you doing? >> Had better days. >> Yeah, I know you have. Yeah, you and all the rest of your crew, are going down. We're watching you particularly closely because we know how close you are with Eddie. >> Sounds like a really great story, but I think you're wasting your breath. Cause you never found anything on me. >> No point in bullshitting me, Johnny, we know everything that's going on. So I thought I would make you an offer before it's too late. Even for you. You help me Johnny and I'll see to it that you're takin care of. >> Ahh, until you're on a doughnut break, and then I'd get a bullet in the head. >> You're dead without us anyway. You want one? >> Thanks but no thanks. >> Sure? >> Uh-huh, now unless I'm under arrest, I'm going to leave, okay? >> Yeah sure, okay. We'll be watching you, Johnny. You want one of these? >> No thanks, Chief, I'm on a diet. >> But they're good. Stay on that kid's ass, will ya. >> All right chief. >> Hey.>> You all right Johnny? You're just staring at that window, like you're stoned or something. >> Nah, I'm all right, just a little tired, you know. >> You must be, I walked right by you and you didn't even look at me. You always look at me. >> Who told you I always check you out? >> Nobody has to tell me nothing, Johnny, I gotta sixth sense. >> Hmm, so what you doin right now, you got time for a coffee? >> I got a client to see, but I guess I could spare a couple of minutes. >> All right, come on inside, let's go. >> So I hear Eddie's really taken you under his wing huh. Sounds like a great opportunity to me. >> It's profitable, but more for Eddie than anyone. >> Yeah.>> Thank you. >> There's always a catch. >> That's for sure. >> So what were you daydreaming about? >> I was daydreaming about you and me. >> Oh yeah? And what were we doing? >> We were on one of those buses out there, going to this small town. Where we had a house with a garden, and a white picket fence, and everyone liked us there. Only there was no dope addicts or dirty old men hanging around. >> You mean, we were there, like together. >> Yeah, we were very together. >> And were we alone in that little house, or did we have a little company? >> Planning for company. >> Johnny, I think I really like it when you daydream. And I think you're going to make me start daydreaming too. [beeper buzzing] >> Oh shit. Back to reality. >> Yeah. >> I better get back to work. >> Me too. Listen, come and see me whenever you want. We can talk about your dream some more. Who knows, maybe I'll be able to expand on it a little. >> Sounds good, I'll talk to you later, okay. >> Yeah. >> Eddie, why don't you come out with my friends, just once, huh? >> Why, what for? >> Because it's a drag, I mean everybody goes out there with their boyfriends and I'm just all by myself. I don't even think they believe that you exist anymore. >> Who gives a fuck? >> I do, they're my friends. >> I'm your friend. >> What am I going to do with you? Hmm, I'm going to show you. >> Eddie. >> Listen Angel I gotta talk to Johnny for a few minutes. You want to wait for me in the red room?>> Okay. >> We'll see you soon sweetie. >> Bye Johnny.>> Bye Angel. How you doing?>> Good, how you doing Eddie? >> Okay. So, I'm really happy, you're doing well? It's obvious you're ready for bigger shipments. >> I feel ready. >> Listen, there's going to be a big load waiting for you in the same spot tonight. You still got the keys? >> Of course. How much of a load are we talking about? >> Quarter pound. Tony's getting the same amount too. But remember, you already get ten points more. Here's a little bonus, get you started. >> Yeah, thanks a lot Eddie. You know I know these big shipments, they're gonna run smooth. >> Ahh, listen, just wanna let you know I'm really happy with the way you've been hustling. >>Hey, if you're happy, I'm happy. Talk to you soon okay. >> Go do it kid. >> All right. [dramatic music] >> Salvi come here, I gotta talk to you. You remember what we talked about before. Doing some unloading? >> Sure Johnny, yeah. >> How long will it take you to sell half an ounce? >> A day.>> Yeah? >> Yeah>> Okay. You got the money for an ounce? >> Yeah sure. >> Okay, I'm going to give you two ounces, all right? Pay for one now, pay for the other one when you unload it.>> All right Johnny. >>Okay, I'm going to get the blow, you get your money together, meet me back here, in an hour.>> Alright, alright cool. >> Okay.>> Listen we're going to make a lotta money, you and I, eh. >> All right. [dramatic music] >> Hey Johnny. >> What's up? >> What you selling? >> What you lookin for? >> A rock? That all you got? >> That's all I got on me. What the fuck, what are you doing? You tryin to fucking rip me off? >> Trying, I'll give it back. >> Hey man, next time you fuckin see me, run the other fucking way, understand? Cause I'll fuckin kill you next time. Understand. >> Yes, sorry. [dramatic music] >> Hey Ralphy, let's dance . I've been waiting all night.>> Nicole man, I don't dance. Jonas man, why don't you dance with her. >> Jonas dance with me. >> What's in it for me?>> Because it feels good. >> Yo Ralphy, you know this is my kid sister, uh.>> Hey. >> It's all right babe, I'm over sixteen. >> Just make sure you get her home by four. >> Thanks man. >> I'm really impressed with the ..... >> Who designed it ? >> Well, actually I recommended the colors at the back and you know, we all just kinda of had ideas. >> Yeah sure meathead... >> You got any? >> Yeah. >> Johnny, I was hoping you'd be here. >> I can't talk right now, you going to be here for a while? >> Yeah, yeah I'll be here. >> I gotta talk to Eddie. Okay, I'll talk to you later, okay. >> Yeah, sure. >> Johnny, you made it, all right, for a change. Can I get you a drink? >> Yeah, scotch please. >> Hey, kiddo, how you doin? >> Hey man I got to talk to you okay? >> Yeah.>> Okay. >> You going to give me a minute? >> Okay.>> I'll be back soon. Okay, let's go. >> Hey, where'd you come from? You want some pop... >> Hey guys, you wanna scram for a minute?>> Hey. >> Can we just finish this first? >> What's wrong, you don't believe in sharing, it's nice. >> Take it out there.>> You're crazy, you can't smoke in there, It's the heat... >> The doors are locked, and the club is closed. >> Everything's okay Eddie? >> It's fine, go ahead, have a good time. >> Take it easy.>> Thank you. >> So what's your problem kid? Come on, out with it. >> I don't know how to tell you this Eddie. The shipment's been stolen. >> Tell me more Johnny. >> I don't know how this fuckin happened, man. I went to do the pick up, just like before. Car was trashed, all the windows were broken, glove box was ripped open. >> Be honest with me. You tell anybody about the car? >> Eddie I swear, I never told a soul, man. >> All right. I'm going to send Meathead and Rush out to do some checking around. Whoever it was, we'll get him, I always do. >> I know you do. >> Just go out there and have a few drinks. Act cool, like nothing happened, okay, >> Okay, I don't know how this fuckin happened man. >> Well don't worry about it, come on, we'll figure it out, okay. Go ahead man, go. >> Mm-hmm, hmm-mm. Yo baby, uhm. So how about a free one, for the rasta man. >> I sure heard a lot about you. >> Good things I'm sure. >> Oh yeah, real good. >> What can you do with a rock hard erection? >> Sweetheart, I can deal with anything. >> A compat with style you know. >> They say you've got a real big one. >> You should see it when I'm excited. >> Really.>> Um-hmm. Then you should have no problem, fucking yourself. >> You like a fucking bitch. >> Yo, get the fuck out of here.>> Police, man. >> Got a deal for you, Shanga. We got rid of some of the Black Angels. Eddie wants you to take out the rest. Here's an advance. Do we have a deal?>> Umm. Don't worry man. Just leave all them bastards to me. Now you just get the fuck outta my neighbourhood, see. [car engine starting] >> Party, easy money, easy money. >> Bandit, dead. >> Shanga will take care of it for us. >> Compliments of Bandit. [gun firing] >> Mmm-mmm. >> Better? [men talking] >> Hey, it's about time. >> Hey Eddy.>> We've got serious problems. >> Hi guys.>> First the Black Angels screwed up a major deal, and now Johnny's shipment is stolen. >> What?>> The fuck, you serious Eddie? >> Yes I'm serious Rush, you guys are family. Tell me who wants to hurt us, who ripped us off? >> Jacko opened a sleazy strip joint to deal out of. >> To deal out of? He doesn't get his supply from us anymore does he Eddie? >> You're right, he hasn't for a while. >> So, shall we put him out of business? >> That's exactly what we're going to do. I want you two guys to go down to Jacko's new hole in the wall tonight and blow it to kingdom come. >> All right, you got it. >> Hey, let it be known, we now run this city. >> Okay, all right.>> Come on, let's go. >> The blow's inside lady. >> Jacko's making a killing. >> You said it. [dance music] >> You stupid freak. >> Sssorry.>> You deformed little freak. >> Come here, you makin fun of me? >> Hey pal, take it easy man, Kenny didn't know. Some of Eddie's goons, they roughed him up a little while back. Let me buy you one on the house. >> Right on man.>> Okay. Sit down and enjoy the show, all right. Kenny here's only doing his job. Kenny come on, back to the bar. Hey Jake, you want to send a free one down to that clown at table sixteen. We're going to have some major fires to put out when this one's done. >> What, the big lummox mess up again. If Eddie Vegas finds out that we're still pushing blow, he'll try to shut us down. >> Oh yeah right Jake, Eddie's so full of himself now, he thinks he's king of the whole Junction. But you're right, these guys here are getting a little antsy. So I'll put a little extra weight on the door for tomorrow night. [dance music] >> And here she is boys, the cure for reduced ozone, terminal sun stroke, and that midnight frostbite, the queen of section four, the one, the only, Gold Dust. [people cheering and whistling] [burlesque music] >> Hey, happy now Jake. >> Yah, that's more like it. >> Yeah, we're selling high grade to scurvy measlies eh? >> Quiet you little shit. >> Oh relax Jake. You don't think these guys are listening to us are you? They're too busy listening to their own hard on's, or be screaming if they had one. [burlesque music] >> I could do with a hit about now. >> Hey guys, what's the action like? >> There's only one way to find out, buddy. >> Oh yeah? [gun firing]>> Uhh! Excuse me. Bye bye, Jacko. [burlesque music] [tires screeching] [explosion] [people screaming] >> Jacko swears his boys didn't steal our shit, and he's promised to quit dealing. Now we're back to square one. >> You know my personal theory is that it's gotta be somebody from the jungle. Who around here would be stupid enough to fuck with your supply >> Well listen let me ask you this. How often does somebody from the jungle come down here? And even if they did, somebody'd have seen them right. >> Yeah, yeah, that's true. Those Jamaicans know not even to come into the area to buy a package of cigarettes or there's gonna be trouble. And plus we have our permanent guy out there checking things out for us. >> It's gotta be somebody from around here. Somebody from our organization. >> Well who else knew where the shit was? >> Just me and Johnny. [dramatic music] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] >> We've got the leader of the Black Angels here now sir. Well get him in here, bring him in. Maybe he can tell me something. >> Come in here pal. >> Thanks for coming down. >> Thanks for forcing me down here. >> Sit down. Well I figured that you would agree with me that this violence is getting out of hand. And you know, maybe we can do something about it, if we work on it together? >> Hmm, work together? Where were you guys when all the drug dealers were coming into our hood, just to give us a hard time. You didn't want to work together then. >> Well, now's a good time to start. I'll help you, you help me. >> We got our own thing going on. >> Oh you do. You know I could put an end to this vigilantism pretty fast. >> We don't need you. You deal with your own problems. >> Those white boys come to our hood and kill some of the Angels. >> You get them back man no, no whiteys back here. We get them good man. Take them and beat them and beat them to a pulp man. Beat them big pulp man. >> Check this out, a couple of angels.>> Oh ho, yeah. >> Hey angels nice day for a show down. >> Yeah, nice day to die. >> I'm ripping your fuckin head off, puke. >> Come on my man. >> Shanga rules. >> Angels rule man. >> You're dead now angel. >> Jenkass. >> Very good gentlemen, very good. I really enjoy the wrath to that fight. Unfortunately this reminds me of a little thing my mama told me once. You can never send a boy to do a man's job. I'm comin to kill you tonight. >> Who you Shanga? You must be nuts man. >> Look I been paid to do a job, nothing personal, but by God I'm goin to do it. >> I'm going to kick your backside, drag your nasty black ass straight to the barbershop. >> Shanga, you gonna pay with your blood. That white boy Eddie might pay you pretty good, but make no mistake. Even you can't kill all us Angels. >> Watch me. >> Angels. >> Look at this garbage, this is what you get for fucking with Shanga. >> Shanga rules. >> Yeah. >> I don't believe this, every newspaper, right on the front page. Gang wars, street unsafe. The bloodshed's gotta end right here and right now. I want these punks busted even if it's for jaywalking. And no excuses. Yeah give me the one four, will you. [knocking on door] >> It's Tony, you want me to get rid of him? >> Tell him to get lost. >> What's up Tony?>> I gotta speak to Eddie man. >> What about, he's busy. >> Tell him I think I know who ripped him off. >> What do you want? >> Before I tell you what I know, I need to get a few things straight, all right Eddie. >> Sure. >> Did the shipment get ripped off on Friday night? >> That's right. >> So Johnny hasn't had anything to sell since then right. >> That's right? >> Well, last night I went down to the park, to sell a few of the boys that I usually sell to. Just like you told me to do. >> Yeah, so what. >> Well Eddie, I hope I'm wrong but, they said they didn't need anything, that Johnny had just came by and sold to all of them. And the same thing happened down by the school. >> You know what you're saying, Tony. >> Yeah I do. [knocking on door] >> Eddie what's up man, come on in. >> Just asking, Is anyone home Johnny? >> No why? >> Listen, I got some information, and it's my obligation to check out any leads, right. >> Definitely. >> I'm not going to say from who or where, but it concerns you. >> What? >> Just tell me straight, did you steal the load? >> What, are you fucking crazy? And ruin everything I've worked for, come on Eddie what are you talking about man. >> Listen, I hope I'm wrong. If I am, I'm going to make it up to you, okay. Just let the guys check the place out, all right. >> Sure, whatever makes you happy man.>> Okay. >> Where should we start Rush? >> Let's start in the basement, where is it? >> Why don't you try downstairs. I don't know why you're doing this man, you're not going to find anything. >> There's nothing downstairs, we'll check upstairs now. [dramatic music] >> Aha, well lookie here. >> This it Eddie, is this or what? >> What the fuck is that man? >> What is this Johnny? >> I don't know, I never seen that before, I swear to God. >> Eddie I've never seen that before man. >> You fucking ripped me off? >> I didn't. I didn't.>> How can you do this to me? You think you can do this to Eddie Vegas and get away with it? >> Fuck man. >> You little scumbag. I trusted you and you screwed me. Okay boys. You take this piece of shit and get rid of him. I don't care how you do it. Just make sure he suffers. >> Come on you're mine now. >> Fuck man, I didn't fuckin do it, I didn't do nothing man. I fucking didn't. >> We know you did it Johnny. >> Come on let's go.>> I didn't do anything. >> Just shut the fuck up man you know I always had you figured you for a fucking rat. I don't know what Eddie ever saw in you but it doesn't matter now, does it shit stain. >> I'm lookin forward to this you fricking ma face, nothing's going to save you now, fucker. >> Yeah. >> Aww, uhh. Aww. >> You really think you're tough eh motherfucker? >> Aahhhh! My eye, my eye, aww. >> Johnny, oh my God, you scared me.>> Shh, shh, shh, shh, you can't say my name too loud around here.>> Why? >> It's a long story, I'll fill you in later. Right now I've got a big favor to ask of you.>> What? >> I need a place to crash for a couple of days, can you help me out? >> Sure, sure, why don't we go there now. It's dead out here anyhow. >> Okay, okay, let's go. >> This isn't my organization, this is our organization. We have been ripped off by an imposter. Johnny has somehow managed to build our trust over the years and now he's now betrayed that trust. I want him to suffer, for making all of us suffer. For the next several days I want everybody in this organization to dedicate all their time to finding Johnny for me. I want people waiting outside his house, outside his friends' houses, checking places he used to hang out, and questioning people he hung out with. I want every stone over fucking turned in this city and just to show how much I appreciate the hard work. Five times this, ten grand, and the pleasure of inflicting pain on that scumbag. Now unless there's any questions, get out there and find that motherfucker. Ralphy, I gotta speak to you for a minute. >> Hey man, I'm gonna make me some real money. >> You're closest to Johnny, Ralphy. But I don't want that to stop you from doing your job. If you still value working here, don't sell yourself short. >> Okay Eddie, I'll do it. >> Get it done. And Ralphy, one bullet in the foot, I want him back here alive. Hey Shanga, come on over and sit down. Here's your balance my good man, you did a good job eliminating those Black Angels for me. You like killing. >> If the money right. >> You heard the deal on Johnny.>> Uh-hmm. Get him for me, I'm gonna throw in an extra two grand. Here's the bonus, best hydro in town. >> What with. You want me to kill him? >> No, I want him back here alive. But feel free to kick the living shit out of him. >> No problem man. >> Good. >> I still can not believe he would screw Eddie like that. >> Facts are the facts man, uh. Meathead told me they found the blow right under his bed. Who knows why he did it. I guess you can never tell anybody nowadays. >> For fifteen grand he's buying hisself a tombstone. >> Yeah right. >> You guys heard anything yet or what? >> No. >> Well then let's hit the streets and start looking for that fucker. I'm going to find Jonas and Christian, and we'll all go out lookin, hmm. [dance music] [pager beeping] >> It's Ralphy, can I use your phone? >> It's over there. [telephone ringing] >> Ralphy here. >> Ralphy, what's up? Ralphy, you still there? >> Johnny, what's been going on? >> At the bridge right now? All right, see you then. I gotta go and meet Ralphy. I think he can tell me what's going on. >> Are you sure you can trust him? You know everybody that works for Eddie's after you. And he's offering money to the first person that finds you. >> I don't have to worry about Ralphy. I've known him since I was a kid. He would never try to screw me up, ever. >> Just be careful, okay. >> I will, I better get going. I'll talk to you later, okay. Thanks a lot. [dramatic music] >> Johnny, what the fuck's been going on with you man? >> I don't know, what have you heard? >> I heard you stole his dope man, and he fuckin found it at your place. >> I swear, I never stole his dope. The night of the party I went to do my pick up, the shit was gone. Couple of days later, Eddie shows up at my place and boom, there it is. >> I've known you for a long time, right Johnny. And I've never known you to be a liar. But nobody's gonna believe you in a million fuckin years. >> I know, that's why I gotta find out who stole the shit and put it in my house man, had to be someone close on the inside, you know what I mean. >> Listen to what I'm sayin to you man, it's fuckin over for you and everyone knows it. I love you like a brother, man, but I'm playing this sick fuckin game too. I'm takin you in, man. >> Is this what it comes down to? >> Come on man, I'm not gonna make you suffer. >> I can't believe you can even consider this. I've known you my whole life, you gonna fuckin blow that for a lousy ten grand. >> Just co-operate, this ain't no game. >> No, what the fuck is it then, you gonna shoot me? Come on, shoot me, come on I'll make it easy for you, you fuckin weasel. Shoot your best friend in the fuckin back, that ought'a be worth a few grand cause that's the only way I'm going anywhere with you. What's the matter Ralphy, things ain't going like you planned? You don't have the balls. Do you? See what fear feels like Ralphy, huh? Feel like you're gonna die, see how it feels? Do you like that, huh? >> I'm sorry Johnny, I swear, I don't know what got into me, man. If I help you my life's at stake too. And I didn't do nothing to no one man. >> Don't worry Ralphy, I'm not going to shoot you, you're no fuckin threat, you're too much of a fucking weasel. >> I'm sorry man, let me help you. You need a place to crash, you name it man, I'll get it. >> I don't need nothing from you man. Want to fuckin help me? Find out who set me up. I don't need fuckin bullshit like this, man. >> Okay man. I'll be talking to you soon man. I promise, I'm going to make this up to you man. [phone ringing] >> Hello.>> Mary, it's me, Johnny. >> Johnny, where are you what's going on? >> I've been set up with stolen drugs. Eddie's after me. >> Why are you still involved with that guy? >> He won't harm you, it's me he wants. >> Yeah that really makes me feel safe. >> I can straighten it out, I just need time. Just be careful, I'll fix it. I'm sorry. >> So what exactly are you going to do if this thing doesn't turn out your way? >> Haven't even thought of that yet. >> You could leave town, I'd go with you. >> I'm not going to run. >> Guess I'm not leaving either. [sentimental music] >> I'm sorry Suzanne, did I wake you? >> Yeah, no, I mean, it's okay. >> Gonna have a coffee with me before I leave? >> I might as well, I'm up now. Where you going anyway? >> I'm going to hit the streets and see what's going on. >> You never did tell me what happened. How did you get set up? >> All I know is someone stole the shipment from me and Eddie's hiding place, that nobody else knew about, and planted it in my bedroom. I don't know how or when, all I know is the stuff was gone on Friday, and there's usually there's someone home at my place on the weekends. >> There was no one home on Saturday at noon. >> How do you know that? >> Because I went by your place to see how you were. I knew something was wrong with you on Friday night, and I just wanted to make sure you were all right. >> Now you know why. >> Oh my God, Johnny. When I was at your place, I saw someone leaving, it was Tony. >> You sure it was Tony? >> Uh-hmm. Are you sure you have to leave so early? >> Yeah, I've got to go down to the park and see a few of the guys. >> Couldn't they wait just a few more minutes. >> I'll be back soon. >> Hurry up.>> Okay. [dramatic music] [phone ringing] >> Yeah. >> Eddy, Johnny just left Suzanne's place. >> What? >> He's heading south, along main street. I think I can head him off. >> That two timing whore, she's on my payroll. Listen, I'll send Rush after Johnny. I want you and Jonas to remind Suzanne who keeps her safe. >> Couldn't wait, huh. Hey, hey, get off of me. >> Come here, what's the matter slut? >> Johnny, listen, I got some news for you man. A few of the boys saw you leaving Suzanne's this morning, I think she might be in trouble. >> What, are you sure? >>Johnny?>> Shut up I'm on the phone. Shut up. >> Eddie has Jonas and Christian in front of her place, and Freddie and Venus in front of your mothers. So you better watch your back.>> All right. >> I need something from you. >> I don't got nothing, get out of here. >> Johnny, you fuckin asshole. >> Suzanne, Suzanne, oh my God, are you okay? Are you okay baby, I'm so sorry baby, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay baby, it's okay.[crying] >> Suzanne, I think things are going to get worse before they get better. >> What are we going to do? >> I want you to stay at my sister's for a couple of days until I straighten this mess out. >> What about you? >> I'm going to stay here if it's all right with you. >> You'll be safe here? >> Don't worry Suzanne, I want them to find me now. [sirens wailing] >> Johnny? >> Yeah, how you doing? You remember Suzanne. >> Of course I do. Oh my God, what happened to your face. >> Couple of Eddie's goons gave her a hard time. I think she'll need some rest. >> Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. >> Johnny. Suzanne, you take Johnny's room, it's upstairs and then turn left.>> Thanks. >> Let's go. [sentimental music] I got to go Suzanne, take care of a few things. I want you to stay here and rest up, I'll check in on you, all right? >> I'm scared Johnny, what's going to happen to us? >> Don't worry, I'll take care of everything, all right. Okay.>> Yeah. >> I'm going to be staying at Suzannes for a couple of days, if you need to get in touch with me, you can reach me there. She'll give you the number. >> What do you mean Suzanne will give me the number? >> Can she stay here, please? >> Why, so I can get beaten up by the same people who beat her up. >> Eddie would never hurt you. >> This is where I live, and I don't want you bringing your sick existence into my home anymore. >> Mary, I didn't do anything. I was framed. >> It doesn't matter if you did it or didn't do it, you're a drug dealer. This is what happens to losers who choose that life. >> I'm a loser? >> You think the world owes you a living. Look at you, you're probably not even going to see thirty. >> You know, I'm sorry I don't live up to your expectations. But who the hell are you, you're not my mother, so mind your own business. >> Well stop making it my business, and get that whore out of my house. >> It's part my house, you fucking remember. >> Hey, Venus, where you going Venus? Stop man, I wanna talk to you, stop, Venus. You looking for me, huh? >> You're a dead man Johnny. >> Yeah, you tell that sick, fuckin fucker Eddie, I'll be seeing him really soon, okay. Understand?>> Yeah, yeah, I understand, let me go man. >> Okay, this if for watching my fucking house. >> Aww, aww. [dramatic music] >> Let go of me Johnny. >> You're fucking idiots. He's always one fucking step ahead of us. >> Relax, relax it's not our fault.>> Find him. >> Whose fault is mine, for giving you losers a job huh? Whose?>> Eddy We want to find him just as much as you do, okay. >> Oh yeah, huh, get him. >> We'll get him, we'll take care of it. Jonas, Jonas wake up and get him. Go find him, get him, get him, [police dispatch] >> Bobby, how you doin? >> You know, business as usual >> Yeah, I hear you. >> So what you lookin for, Johnny? >> A piece. >> What kind of piece, we got everything? Uzzi's, 45's. >> Something with stopping power. >> What you need is a 9mm semi automatic. >> How much for everything? >> $450 for the gun and ammo. Hit someone in the head with this and it's instant death. Hit him in the body and you've got serious damage, but depending on where you probably won't kill him. >> This will do. >> Johnny man, what's so urgent? I was just about to get a blow job from Coral. >> What you been hearing, man? >> I've been hearing you've been fuckin up all of Eddie's boys you've been running into, and leaving a trail of blood behind. >> Just been defending myself, man. I don't like killing anyone, but I will if I have to. >> Tell me man, what do you need from me. >> I think I know who set me up. I need you to set up a meeting with Tony. >> Is he the one that fucked you? >> I can't say for sure. You got his pager number. >> Yeah.>>All right. Tell him to meet us at that pool hall in the village. Four o clock this afternoon. >> Got it.>> Okay man, let's go. >> Hello Mary. >> Yeah. >> I gotta talk to you. >> There's nothing to talk about. >> I gotta ask you a question. Why would Johnny do this to me? >> Johnny didn't do anything to you. >> I saw the stuff, right in your house. >> He said he didn't take it. Has he ever lied to you before? >> It doesn't matter. >> What do you mean it doesn't matter? >> Someone has to pay. >> You mean my brother has to pay. My brother has to pay? >> I didn't ask for this bullshit. It just fucking happened. >> Don't touch me. Never talk to me again. >> Mary, Mary, tell Johnny to call me. >> Johnny, I didn't come to kill you, just broke you up and take you home. Come on. >> Who the fuck are you man? [gun firing] >> Hey Tony, grab a stick. >> All right, keep it in mind though, I haven't played for a while, all right. >> What the fuck she's doing here? You fuckin hang with her? >> No, no, no, I sell her once in a while, all right. She's a little screwed up, but she's okay. She's kinda like my good deed for the month, you know. >> Yeah yeah, it's your call man. She's fucking nosy. >> She's okay. >> Hey, you're pretty good. Care to make a wager? >> Sure, how much? >> A buck a ball too much? >> Sounds good to me. >> Maybe if we get lucky I can win a free buzz off of you.>> Yeah. I wouldn't count on it. >> Holy shit Johnny. What are you doing here? >> Hi Johnny, how's it going? >> You want to play Johnny, it's a buck a ball. >> Yeah, grab a stick. >> Yeah, all right. >> You can shoot now, we just started. >> I must be lucky. Hey, I'm on a roll. So Tony, how's it going? How's business? >> Well, it's been pretty busy, since you've been gone, a little too busy, >> That figures. >> How about you? >> I've been thinking a lot, you know. >> Yeah, about what? >> About you. >> Tony, it's your shot man. Tony, it's your shot. >> Yeah, okay, okay, I'm ready. >> Tony wouldn't let you do this to him. >> Fuck off bitch.>> You asshole. >> Get this bitch off of me. >> Get the hell out of my pool hall before I call the police. You broke my dam cue. >> I didn't do anything.>> All right you fucker, I got an eyewitness saw you go into my fuckin house. >> Sorry man, I know a way for you to get out of this whole mess, okay. >> Keep talking, you got about twenty fuckin minutes before you die.>> I know where Eddy's new shipment is, man. It's a motherlode. I'll take you there and get it. >> Yeah, then they'll really fuckin have something on me. >> It's the only way for you to get out of this mess, is to get some leverage on Eddie. If you kill me man, they're still going to come after you. >> One more fucking reason to put a bullet in your head. >> Look I didn't know it would go this far, okay >> Shut up, shut up.>> I figured they... >> How much is there? >> At least a hundred grand worth man, you'll be home free. >> Where is it? >> Just across the tracks, in a warehouse. I'll take you there and get it for you, man. >> Get in the car before the heat comes. >> Come on, lets fucking go. [sirens wailing] [dramatic music] >> What now? >> I want you to stay here and watch out for me all right? >> No problem. >> If I'm not out in ten minutes, come check it out. If the heat comes, honk once. Come on you fuckin jerk, let's fucking go. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. You got the key, open the fuckin lock. Hurry up before I change my mind. >> All right, all right.>> Hurry up. >> Look, I don't need you breathing down my neck okay. >> I don't want to hear your excuses all right, just do it. Where is it?>> It's in the trailer in the back. >> Let's go. Come on. >> It's here man, but it's locked. >> Open it. >> This is it man. >> Give me a bag. It's good, high grade. Where's the rest? >> That's it man, that's all there is. >> There's no more? >> Johnny man, what are you doing? Johnny man come on, I got you the stuff, Johnny man, come on. [gun firing] >> What happened, are you all right? >> We had a bit of trouble in the back. >> Where's Tony? >> I'll fill you in later, let's get out of here. >> Where have you been? >> I'm sorry. >> Get away from me, you're drunk. >> Oh, come on baby, don't be like that, come on. >> Have some respect for me. >> I've been out fucking all day. >> Oh, you've been fucking all day.>> Working. >> I mean I've been out fucking working all day, come on. >> You been fucking all day. >> Angel, you better stop acting like a bitch, or I'm going to start treating you like one. >> We got the blow, we got the power. >> Do we want the power Ralphy? That's the question. You can give this shit back and come clean. As far as Eddie's concerned you're still trying to kill me. >> All right, I'm with you all the way. >> All right, let's give it back, then I'm out of this fucking business man. >> All right. >> How many Angels do you have anyway, huh? >> Only one.

How about you?

They're animals. >> Ralph, that double crossing little rat, I'll fix them both. >> Ralphy, stay right where you are.
