There are a lot of people from different countries gathering at Ian Kwai Fong to celebrate Chinese New Year's Eve. The police estimate around 20,000 people are gathering here. They have arranged for about 120 officers to maintain order. The number of officers they arranged is much more than usual. The public is having fun here. Let's go for the live. Come and get one. Four dollars for one, ten dollars for three. Come and get one. Four dollars for one, ten dollars for three. Four dollars for one, ten dollars for three. Four dollars for one, ten dollars for three. Four dollars for one, ten dollars for three. This one is in red. Is it 30 dollars? It's ten dollars. Come and get one. Four dollars for one, ten dollars for three. Can you help me choose one, please? Hey, kiddo. How dare you sell goodies here? Do you know who the boss is here? - Eight, seven, six, five, - Eight, seven, six, five, - four, three, two, one. - Four, three, two, one. - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! Go away, you're blocking the ambulance's way. Go away. There's nothing to see here. All head to Queen's Road Central. The ambulances need to take this road. Go. Keep walking! There's nothing to see here! The human stampede tragedy happened in Hong Kong, less than an hour after welcoming 1993. It caused 20 people to die. While those people were celebrating the New Year at Ian Kwai Fong in Central, somebody fell down on the floor within the crowd, and they trod on each other. There are more than 80 people who were killed or wounded. Just about a minute after the countdown, somebody fell down at Ian Kwai Fong D'Aguilar Street. Due to the disorderly situation, many people trod on each other. Our reporters could not get closer. After the crowd is leaving gradually, we can see the injured people lying on the street. Too many people here got hurt, the ambulance needs to transfer between hospitals many times. Doctors and nurses are also here for the rescue. Why are you so late? You must be hungry. Take a seat first. Go wash your face. I prepared food for you. Eat it. The noodles are getting sticky. I always tell you not to go to crowded places. You never listen to me. I said I'm fine. Don't bother. So why didn't you come back early? I was trying to help those injured people. You were trying to help people? Were you helping people or getting help there? I said I was helping people. Helping others depends on your ability. Don't try to do something you cannot do. Do you think you are so smart? I want to learn boxing. What are you learning boxing for? You think knowing boxing can help others? If I can fight, no one can bully me. Who will bully you? Tell me. What did you do tonight when you were out there? Did you fight with someone? Yes. I have been beaten up. Those gangs broke all my light sticks. You got beaten by others? If you don't bother them, will they beat you? No, I did not provoke him. They bullied me first. If I know boxing, they can't bully me anymore. How many times have I told you since you were a kid? I will not let you learn boxing. I want to learn boxing. Why boxing? You've always wanted to learn boxing. Do you really think they will not bully you if you can fight? Yes. If I know boxing, no one can hurt me. I don't allow you to learn boxing. If I can fight, I can protect myself. When I was bullied, you were not by my side. You couldn't see even if you were there. I don't want to stay at home all day, just like you. If you don't allow me to learn, I will go learn it by myself. Rub it where you feel pain. After that, do remember to eat the noodles. Hurry up. Hurry up. There is a step. Bull. Bull. There are pillars. It looks cool. Do you need help? Is Master Hing here? What can he do for you? I want to learn boxing! Dad, they are looking for you. Who wants to see me? Everyone, come over here. Greet Brother Ming. - Brother Ming. - Brother Ming. This is my son. Be polite. Mr. Ming. Mr. Ming. Mr. Hing. Mr. Hing. Good kid. Why didn't you look for me? I can work. I don't want to be a burden. Life is hard enough. You don't have to take care of one more blind man. So you spread the rumors of your death in the Mainland's hospital after the medical treatment failure? Brother Ming. After all these years, I have gotten used to it. It's okay. My name is Bull. You're Bull? I'm Stag. Then you two probably can't communicate with each other. - Stag. - Stag. Hit him. That's right. Keep going. You're too weak, he can take you down on his first try. You should fight then if you think you're so much better. Big Brother Fai. Calm down. Brother Ming, see. You son is doing well. Just like when you were young. What? These guys think they are the boss now? They are becoming more and more arrogant. Boss, should we take any action? How dare they play tricks on me? Come here! What is this? What games are you guys playing? You guys are practicing every day. What do you think the company hired you for? You leave all the work behind. Do you want to be the boss now? It's still lunch break, why can't we exercise? You two are always taking the lead. What? Are you feeling furious? Then pack your stuff and leave. Fine, I will leave. I don't give a darn. Working with a boss like you, I would rather starve than earn from you. What did you say? Ah Wai, get your weapons. Got it. Let me do it. Stop! Hing. Take care of my son for me, please. Watch out, don't get hurt. Move, watch out. Keep going. Harder. Cheng Hing Boxing Club Next. Come, retreat. One, two, three. Come closer. Next. Dad, I am not a kid anymore. I'm not going to fall into your trap. Who's next? Come on. Who's next? Cut the nonsense, Stag. Go for it. You are going to be killed. Shut up. What if I hurt Bull? No way, you are the son of Master Hing. You must have some secret moves. Why don't you show us some? So you know there are secret moves. They can't be shown easily. Are you scared? - Stag! - Stag! Okay, I'll fight. But I will fight with you. Wait for a moment, please. You are sweating. Go find a seat. Looks like you really want to fight. Come out then! - I'll fight with you. - Don't regret it. By the way, Ah Wai opened a boxing club a few years ago. But they fight in a dirty way. I know and they are running some illegal business too. He is a man with an evil heart. His students are not good either. What is wrong with you, man? Let's do it again. Mo! Are you trying to kill him? It looks quite bad. Take it slow. Am I disfigured? I still got a chance for TVC. What's the matter? That's what we call boxing. There is no mercy when you fight! But you were just like killing someone. Mr. Hing, this is how it should be on the ring. People will say I have no respect if I don't do my best. True, I did ask you to make an effort, but I didn't ask you to use dirty approaches. I need you to fight in a decent manner. I know you also joined another boxing club. You're a double-faced man. I don't care who your master is outside, but you need to listen to me when you are in my club, otherwise, you can't be my student. What's the point of boxing if it is not for winning? I shall go home to do yoga. I am leaving now, you idiot. It has been a while. Master Wai. You are finally back, man. Sorry, let me go get changed first. Why do you punch so gently? Kuen! Show them how to fight. Do it this way, all right? You understand now. That is what boxing looks like. You wimp. Do it again. The circuit breaker is broken again? Give me your phone. Wait. Turn on the flashlight. - Watch out. - Take it slow. Avoid sandbags. - Take it slow. - It's so dark. I can't see anything. Watch out. - Watch out for the steps. - I see it. There is a torch above the electrical box. Let's see. I found it. Hey. Everything seems fine. It must be the electricity bill. Do you need help? What help? Money. You also work in a scrapyard. How can you help? In this kind of situation now, I must give you a hand. Who will ask students to settle the electricity bill? It is my dad's fault. The tuition fee is so low, and he is unwilling to increase it. The rent is rising every month, and he is so picky in accepting students. Especially those arrogant and impolite students, neither the provocative nor the aggressive ones. But he taught you anyway. Moreover, whose boxer is not fierce? Or do we have to fight with shutting our eyes? Ever since I was a kid, Mr. Hing never charged me. Am I still a human if I don't help him in this situation? No, you are not. You are my good buddy. You are still playing this game at this age? Stop it! Who's there? What are you two doing in the dark? Since you've already found out about us, I don't have to hide anymore. Actually, we are... Gay. We love playing the yoga ball. It's a yoga ball, right? - You like playing yoga ball? - Wait. Stop. - Keep on playing. - It hurts. What is it? - Mr. Hing. - There's no electricity again? Mr. Hing, you are here too. Caca, are you going out with Stag tonight? Yes, but the two guys... I am not sure what are they doing in the dark. I've told you, we're playing the yoga ball. Stop joking and go for a shower now. Where are we going? How dare you forget that we are going to a movie? You always put me to the least. Let's shower together. I'm scared of the dark. - Let's shower. - Go. Let's go, but where should we go? We can go for a walk and meet some girls. It's better than staying at the boxing club all day, right? Girls are always a nuisance. You will be fine when you get a girlfriend. Let's ask Stag to introduce you to some girls. He knows a lot of pretty girls. No way. He is the last person I can trust. Hey, why don't you take me out to meet new girls? I quit this long ago. You can make a comeback. Let's go! - Let's go eat first. - Cool. Hey, let's get some beer. No problem. It's my treat. Thank you. Hey, I advise you to think seriously. Think about what? Hi. You're finally here. Come and sit down. Hey, Caca. I'll never know this place if you didn't suggest it. It's good, right? Then come more often if you have time. I'll come if he comes. Hey. Why do you look so upset? It's all about the boxing club. Bull, how about you start teaching boxing? Just like taking up gangs. Bull. Bull. Hey. What's wrong? I was asking you to be a boxing teacher, recruit some students, and make money for the boxing club. What? I teach boxing? I never had a chance to go in the ring. How would people want to learn from me? Brother Mo. Please request the manager to give us one more free bottle of wine. - Sure, I'll get back to work first. - Okay. Come and sit here. Stag, why is he here? I invited him here. Don't be so sensitive. You know our boxing club does not go well recently. He has many ideas and connections. Maybe he can help. You know he is untrustworthy. Do you want to ask him for help? If there's nothing else, I'll leave first. Come on. Anyway, we used to be brothers in the same club. Are you not with another boxing club now? It won't bother to ask just a few questions, right? Have you guys been having a tough time recently? What kind of tough time? We are good and busy. It's just that we don't have enough money to spend. Have you thought of joining any boxing competitions? No way. How can I fight in the ring? I haven't fought in any amateur matches. I will be killed on stage. But I think Bull could do. Can boxing matches make a lot of money? Of course they can't if you join a proper fight. I'm not talking about the official one. See. Not the official one. Not that one, but those... - Think about it. - I will. How are you? - Big brother. - Big brother. See you later. Come and sit down. Do you guys know each other? Mo, we were fellows before. Fellows? Do you know him too? I was investigating a case recently and he was in the file. He is not a righteous man. Don't get too close with him. See. I get it now. It's time to grow up. I got it. Let's talk about other things. Big brother, I heard that you got promoted. - Congratulations! - Congratulations. So you are the Chief Commander of the police now. Do you think it is an easy job? It is very tough. - It will be yours sooner or later. - Yes, it's sooner or later. Let's drink to that. We need a refill. Excuse me. How's Master? He's pretty good. He always talks about you. Visit us when you have time. Sure, I'll go visit him sometime. Send my regards to your dad. - How is he? - I'll order drinks. He's fine. - Fetch me a drink. - Okay. - What's wrong? - Brother Bull, I didn't know that you are interested in mature women. You are insane. She looks gorgeous for her age. Bull, do you like cradle-snatcher relationships now? Don't listen to him. She looks great and still has the charm. A perfect body figure. Yes, look at her moves. Hey. Hurry up. Bull! What? I was thinking... Just tell me. The thing that Mo mentioned last night. Do you still remember? I think it will work. Forget it. So tell me what else can we do to help the boxing club? Let's think about it again. There must be other ways. I won't ask you for that if I can think of any other ways. I won't take part in any illegal activities. Okay. You keep following your own rules and leave my dad's boxing club slowly to death. You said to me that you want to help my dad. How can you help with only working in a scrapyard? In underground boxing, you use your own fists to make money. People fight with their own will. I'm not asking you to take part in illegal activities. You have learned boxing for such a long time. What's the problem if you want to use what you have learned to help him? Hey. To be honest, if I were as strong as you, I would do it myself. You are so good at this. You can win matches. Do you agree? Okay. If you don't want to fight, then I'll go. At least, I'm doing it for the boxing club. If I die, it is my problem. You? Seriously? Do you really want to go? Go then. You can't even catch the ball, let alone the punches. Don't make me laugh, please. Yes, I can't catch it. So what? I at least have the courage to fight. You think you're better if you can catch it? Go in the ring if you have the guts. Don't tell anyone that you will join underground boxing. They will laugh to death. Just get ready to collect the money for me. What is it now? I love you. You used this trick again? Yoga ball. Go for it, yoga ball. Hurry up. Hurry up. You said you would not come before. You come every day now. I really thought you liked mature women. I get it now. She looks really pretty and young. A pure local girl! Seriously, go for it if you really like her. You are not that young now. Don't keep acting cool all the time. I know you want it much deeper in you. Get off. You have a dirty sick mind. Do you want to meet her? I can introduce her to you. Introduce her to me? You'd better keep an eye on your boyfriend. Look at his face. Maybe he is the one who wants to know the girl. And also, Big Brother Fai. You confess it, finally. Just tell her that you like her. You are the future Boxing Champion. The scent of your sweats can attract both men and women. Cut it off now. Don't sniff him like a dog. What are you doing? Let's go somewhere else. Help! Hey. - Go away! - Help! Don't cause any trouble. I'm not making any trouble. Go away. - Let's go get something to eat. - Hey! Let's go. - Go away. - Let's go together. Sorry. - Look after him. - Sorry. My daughter, are you okay? - Are you okay? Thank you. - I'm okay. No worries, as long as she is fine. Where is your table? Let me buy you a drink. It's okay, no big deal. I'll go to my friends. My daughter, you can continue singing. Hi, your name is... He is Bull, the future Boxing Champion. That's enough. And this is? Our big brother, Inspector Fai. Just call me Fai. - Hi, Inspector Fai, I'm Kwai Hung. - Hello. There are rarely young men willing to stand up to help people now. What would you guys like to drink? It's my treat. That's cool. Thank you, ma'am. What is that wine from 1982 called? La... - Loudene. - Yes, Loud. You are loud. Since you are busy preparing for closing, we'd better leave now. - You're still here? - Hey. I'm leaving with Caca now. See you later. See you later. I have a morning shift tomorrow. I'm leaving as well. Bye. Let me walk him out. Thank you for your help earlier. You're welcome. What's your name? I'm Cheuk Wai. I'm Bull. The song you sang was beautiful. Really? Thank you. It's called "Romance." I always sing it. I rarely see you here. That's normal. So many customers come here every day. Then maybe you should come here more often. Sure, I will. What do you do for a living? Me? Is it a secret? It sounds mysterious. Don't tell me you are a secret agent. Don't be silly. There are no more secret agents nowadays. I work in a scrapyard. I'm a loser, right? Why? Actually, it's not important what your job is. To me, there are only good guys and bad guys. As you have helped me before, I think you are a good guy. You are good at comforting people. I'm not trying to make you feel better. It seems you are good at martial arts. If you are not working in the scrapyard, you could be... A martial arts actor. A martial arts actor? I'll think about it. Okay, what time do you want to meet? And the address? Okay. It's 10 p.m. tonight. Be smart. I know. What happened to him? He's probably dancing. I have no idea what type of genes he got. He wins! Thank you. He got something. He is so-so. Bull, let's go! Thank you. Dad, that's enough for rent and bills for the next few months. Where did you get so much money? I won the Mark Six lottery. Mark Six lottery? I have been betting on horse racing for years, it's hard to win even a couple of hundred. How could you win the Mark Six lottery so easily? What can I do? Thank you. Mark Six lottery is just choosing random numbers. It's much easier. I can win betting on all kinds of animals, such as the rooster, fish, cow, dog fights, even cricket. Except horse racing. You bet on rooster, fish, cow, dog, and even the cricket fights? What year is it now? Where did you buy those tickets from? I want to bet too. Don't say I am not taking you there. You can find it at convenience stores or gas stations. Don't you tell me that this is dirty money. I'll cut your head off if you are doing so. Yes, money is dirty as it has passed through many people's hands. You can launder them before using them if you feel they are dirty. I'm going down to bet on horse racing. I'm not done talking. Come back. Brother Wa. Is he winning again? He just got lucky. Brother Wa is so humorous. What a piece of garbage. Hi, Caca. - What's the matter? Are you all right? - No, I'm fine. Hello. How did you get hurt? Do you fight often? Didn't you ask me to be a martial arts actor? I need to practice it with someone else. You could still make some jokes, maybe it's not that bad. Why? Are you worried about me? No, I'm not. Who cares about you? So why are you asking? I'm not even allowed to ask? Of course you can. But I came for your songs. Now that you have finished singing, I'll get going. Okay. See you later. Hey. Yes? Why did you suddenly buy me a gift? Because I want to. You don't like it? I'll just throw it away then. Don't. Let me put it on for you. Okay. Turn around. It's done. How does it look? Let me see. It suits you very well. Really? Yes, it's perfect. Really? Yes, but this dress doesn't go well with it. Thank you. You are welcome. Why do you give me something like that? Because... It's... What is it? My dad gave me this for practicing boxing when I was a kid. These two look very alike. Which one do you like most? Yours or mine? Normal people will prefer mine. And I like mine. Everyone gets their favorite. Nice. Please stop. I know it's my fault, Master Wai. I really regret it. Do you know what you did wrong? Sorry. I'm sorry, Master Wai. I know. It's all my fault. Sorry. It's good that you know what you have done wrong. I asked you to find a foil, but you gave me such a strong horse. You screwed the whole thing up. Sorry. - It doesn't matter. - I am sorry. I bet one or two hundred thousand each match, and I lost five matches. It was just a million. Pay me back the money and you will be fine! I don't have the money. Sorry. Just a million. It's peanuts. You are so smart. Give me one more chance, Master Wai. - Kuen, he asked me to give him a chance. - Please let me go. Okay. Thank you, Master Wai. Thank you, Master Kuen. There are some goods that need to be delivered. Be smart! Thank you, Master Wai. Thank you, Master Kuen. By the way, where did you find this black horse? He is from the Cheng Hing Boxing Club. That shabby club has someone who can fight so well? Yes, his dad is a close friend of Mr. Hing. I heard that he used to be a good boxer too. But he stopped fighting after he became blind. Mr. Hing taught the boy like his own son. Blind? Yes. They called him Mr. Ming. I remember now! That guy! That is the guy. Bull and I are earning a lot of money lately. Thank you, Brother Mo. By the way, what brings you here? What's wrong with you, Brother Mo? You got bitten by a dog? Not a dog, but a bull. It was all because of Bull. I want him to be a foil in the fights, but he won every game. That made Master Wai lose hundreds of thousands. And that's the reason I got beaten up. Brother Mo, you can't say that. You said if we don't fight to win, why do we fight in the first place? We shall exercise yoga instead. You said it's stupid. Just cut the crap. Now, I got one big deal as you return me a favor. What do you want me to do? If only I can do it. You work in the scrapyard, don't you? Just prepare me a small wagon car. A small wagon car? What is it for? Don't ask. Just get it ready for me in three days, okay? Okay. But can you at least tell me what is it for? Just mind your own business. I gave you the opportunity because you want to make more money. We can split the profit 60-40 when it is done. I feel embarrassed for taking 60, it's a bit too much. Three days. Remember. But Brother Mo. Brother Mo. Hey! You freaked me out. Why are you sneaking around? What is a 60-40 split? I'm not sure what he is talking about, 7-seaters, and 60-40 split profit. Split profit? Mo was never a decent man. He won't even give you a dime he has. It's all right. Don't say I didn't warn you, don't get close to him. I got it, okay? Shabby parts. Hey. Stag. Why are you here? Why are you here too? I was looking for you. Boss suddenly asked me to work the night shift. Yes. Me too. By the way, what are you doing here? Nothing, the boss asked me to repair an old car. I'm not talking about the old car. I'm asking what's between you and Mo. What thing? We are doing nothing. Let's start working then. Stop pretending you don't know. Every time you avoid me, you are hiding something. I'm not a fool. Boss said I was the only one who had the shift tonight. You are still lying. Just stay away from this. Just stay away from this? Mr. Hing has been teaching us to uphold justice and morality since we were kids. And now, you are doing some dirty business with Mo. What if something goes wrong? What have I done? I'm just preparing a car for him. He is the one who does the dirty thing. - I won't be involved. - Hey. Hey, don't leave. That means you are really helping him? It's a crime. Why are you helping him? A criminal? You haven't broken any laws? I only prepare a car. What about involvement in underground boxing? Isn't it more serious? Yes, I did get involved in underground boxing. But who asked me to? It was you. What did you say when you asked me to join? You said using your own fists to earn money. It's not against the will of god because all fighters join in with their own will. And now what? You only provide help without knowing what it's used for. What if something goes wrong? Mo was beaten by his boss. It's none of our business. Why not? You won every match, which makes him suffer. Don't forget he was helping us when we have difficulty. He is in trouble now and all we need to do is to offer a little help, just to pay him back. Only once. Also, do you really think that I'm making money for myself? No, I'm doing all this for the boxing club. I'm only good at talking. What else can I do? I can't fight as well as you. If I could, I would go in the ring by myself. What are you talking about? What am I saying? You are the Boxing Champion. You win every match. Once you get in the ring, everyone applauds. Everyone is scrambling to take photos. And me? Do you know what I was doing? And how people were talking behind me? They said I am just a dog wagging around you. I am worse than a beggar. What else can I do? Since I was a kid, every girl I admire likes you but not me. In the boxing club, everyone is offering to help you, and all their eyes are on you. How about me? I feel like I was adopted. You called my dad Mr. Hing. You should have called him "dad" instead. Yes, you are the almighty. This is about me and Mo. I won't drag you into this. Don't worry. - All right. - You are the Boxing Champion. So you want to be faithful to him now? You're turning your back to me now, aren't you? You blamed me for this after all we have been through together. If you break the law and get caught, you will be sent to jail. Don't expect me to help you out. Just leave! Go away, this place is too small for you. Only the sky out there is big enough for you. Only the world can satisfy your wishes. I think your voice is very beautiful today. What do you want from me? Just say it. You are always so smart. I have a date with Stag, but I'm going to be late. Can you close the shop for me, please? Just this time. You are the best! - Go. - Thank you, bye. Bye. Brother Mo. Is anyone upstairs? No. Go ahead. What should we do? Sorry to keep you waiting. No worries. I could see you longer. Big brother, I didn't expect to see you here. I was just passing by and want to say hello to you. Let's go grab something to eat. I'm busy. Let's make it next time. You need to eat anyway. My boss already hurried me many times. All bosses are like this. I'll help you after dinner. I am handy too. Thank you, big brother, but it's dirty. I can handle it. It's all right. Is the car ready? Hey. I'll go to the toilet first. Go. Let's go for dinner. Why is he here? He's my colleague. Colleague? You said he was your boxing fellow, but he is your colleague now? I warned you not to get too close to him. What's that? What car? It's nothing. It's just a job from a client. Who would demand a secret compartment in a car? - What is it for? - No. I'm asking you. What are you doing with them? It's really nothing, big brother. Big brother! So you don't want me to wait until you finish your work? No. That means yes? I'll get changed first. Just make things simple. Stag set us up. The police are here. - No way. - Hide the stuff first. Where can we hide this? I don't know. Give it to me. We are done. Master Wai will kill us all. Kill what? It was Stag who snitched. It was his fault, wasn't it? - Yes. - Yes. So everything is on him, right? - Yes. - Yes. That's right. Hurry up. Rinse it. Big brother! Stand still and freeze your hands. Is there anything I can help with, sir? What are you doing here? What's going on? We are chatting. You're chatting here at midnight? Is it illegal? Shut up. Stand on both sides. Is everything okay, sir? If nothing happens, can we go, please? You are lucky this time. Are you going to hit back? No. Please don't beat me! Don't tell me you have no idea what's up there. Let me tell you, today is your lucky day, not theirs. If they get in any trouble, you will be caught as well. I watched you grow up, do you want me to handcuff you myself? How can I face our master? And your dad? Wake up, Stag. Remember, stay away from those people. They'll get caught sooner or later. I got it. You brat, how dare you snitch on us? Brother Mo, I didn't know he would come and ask me to out for dinner so late. He asked you out for dinner? Cut the nonsense. What a coincidence. Do you think I am a fool? Brother Mo, you will be caught by now if I did. Whatever you say. We lost the stock because of the police. Brother Mo, I have nothing to do with the stock. You dropped it, and I didn't know it. Yes, you got nothing to do with this. It doesn't matter. You can say whatever right now. You can explain to Master Kuen when he arrives. Brother Mo, it has nothing to do with me. - Hey, Brother Mo. - Here he is. You are done. It's not my fault. You dropped it. - Brother Mo. - You tell him. Don't talk to me. Inspector Fai. Be honest. Stag is doing some dirty deals with Mo and his gang in the scrapyard. Do you know that? No, I don't. Really? You really don't know? What is it? I was just passing by, and I was thinking about having dinner with Stag, but I saw Mo and his gang were there too. It's fine if you know nothing about this. Bull, we are all like real brothers. Please help me look after Stag for me. I don't want to put him in jail when I go catch Mo. Don't joke, Brother Mo! Don't! Let me down, it hurts. I didn't snitch on you. I didn't snitch on you. - Master Kuen. - Master Kuen. This has nothing to do with you? You jerk. You betrayed us? This is what you deserve. You are useless scum! Shut up. I told you not to go for him. I will deal with you later. Let me settle with him first. You didn't? You jerk. I didn't. Treat him well for me. Stop it. Hey. Let him go. So you are Bull. So should I listen to your order? He had the guts to snitch on me. Now, I have lost all my stock. There are millions, are you going to pay me back? Also, the underground boxing you were involved in made my dad lose hundreds of thousands. I still haven't figured it out with you yet. That was on me. Don't you beat him for that. You're faithful to your friends. I appreciate it. Like dad, like son. What are you talking about? Nothing. I was saying your dad was trying to protect Mr. Hing when they were young and ended up blinded by my dad. I'm trying to remind you that don't get bad luck just like your dad did. Master Kuen, I will finish him. You can leave first. - Run. - Go after them! Go. Go. Go. Jump. Go. Stag! Stag! Stag! - We wish you all the best. - We wish you all the best. Happy birthday, Master Wai! - Cheers to our long-lasting business! - Cheers! - How is it, Master? - Good. Bull, why are you here? What are you doing here? You are Bull? Do you want some more punches? Bull. What brings you here? Did you fight again? Hey. What is the relationship between you and her? Kuen, he is my boyfriend. You jerk, how dare you get in a relationship with my sister. Everyone, sit down. Bull, I don't know what happened between you two, but today is Cheuk Wai's dad's birthday. Can you please leave first? What happened? What are you guys talking about? Dad. Kuen. Bull, what happened? I'm here for the justice of Stag. I don't care about those millions I lost, but now that you hit on my daughter, that is a different story. Kuen. Fine, I'll give you a chance. Let's fight in the ring in a month. If you win, you can ask for whatever you want. But if you lose, you must immediately disappear from my eyesight. Otherwise, I'll beat you up every time I meet you. Okay. Deal. Bull! Bull. Bull. Can you tell me what has happened? What happened between the three of you? I was thinking to introduce you to each other. And I thought they would like you. What happened? Can you please just tell me exactly what happened? The one who beat Stag up badly who is lying in the hospital was your brother. My brother? No way, it could not be my brother. Why did he do that? You should ask him. Can't you hear what I said just now? Can you not fight with my brother? Not fight? Stag is still in a coma now, and we don't know what will happen after he awakes. He may end up a cripple. I only have one brother in my life, if I don't fight, what do you want me to do? I don't want any of you to get hurt. Both of you are important to me. Can you please don't do that? Cheuk Wai, please just don't. Today is your dad's birthday, you should go back. Sorry. God bless and let me win this match, thus I can uphold justice for my dad and Stag. Just be careful. I will make him pay for what he had done. Make way. Ming, it has been a while! How are you? It has been a long time. I'm just trying to say hi. Don't worry. Ming, you are not completely blind. You have a brilliant son who has guts, sticks to promises, and stands up for his friends. Ming, watch out. My god! I forgot you cannot see the world. Sorry. Bye. This is a three-round fight, please touch others' fists. Start! Bull got hit with a few heavy punches, but it seems all right for now. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold it. You did great, Master Kuen. - Please have a seat, Master Kuen. - Well done. Shut up. Give him some water. Rinse your mouth. Get up. It's okay. Those are just some scratches. Can you hold on to it? Can you? Yes. His punches and kicks are strong! Try to keep away from his kicks. Remember. Don't let him kick your head. Move aside. Avoid it! Stag. Use straight blows. I know. Why are you still standing here? I am scared to watch this. You are already here, don't you want to know the result? Come on, let's go. Excellent! Finish him! Round two. Begin! Stay away from the ropes. Push him out. - One, two, three, four, five, - What are you doing? Get up! - Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - Get up! We won. Bull. We won. - Master Kuen. - Master Kuen. Wake up, Master Kuen. - Hold him up. - Master Kuen. Good job. It's okay. Are you all right? It's okay. Does anyone have ointment? - Hold him up. - Master Kuen. - Young Master Kuen. - Go on. Dad, I... Stop talking. Kuen, are you okay? How are you doing?
