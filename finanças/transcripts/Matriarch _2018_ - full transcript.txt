They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you. And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backwards nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness, for even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable." All the women in my family have had boys first. I'm carrying low, I've had no morning sickness. What? He's a boy. A mother knows. What's going on here? Don't know. Pass me the satnav. Just follow the diversion. Got nowhere to be. Okay. - Again? - Oh, I'm sorry. It is a privilege to witness this extraordinary species in her most natural habitat. Matt! Stop it. As you can see, it isn't wise to get too close, so I think we should take this opportunity and back off. Matt, look out! Are you okay? Babe, are you okay? - I'm fine. We're fine. - Are you sure? I took my eyes off the road. I'm so sorry. It's okay. We're okay. You weren't going that fast. Careful. Anything? No. Just giving it a second. What is it? It's like a farm or something over there. How far? About half a mile. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm all right. This is private land! We had an accident. Wondered if you could help. Did you not hear what I said? This is private land. Now on your way. I know. I'm really sorry, but we crashed into a fallen tree and we are totally stranded, so if I could just use your phone, I'd be so grateful. Can't help you. Now, I've asked you nicely. Leave. Look, my wife is heavily pregnant. I'd really appreciate your help. Guilty as charged. Boy or girl? Boy. Well, why didn't you say? Let's see if I get you folks some help. Agnes. Yeah. Agnes, get the china out, we've got guests. Bob, stop it. You know it's wash day, I'm busy. Agnes, just stop what you're doing for a wee minute. I'm bringing this lovely young lady up to the house, and her husband. They've had a wee accident, you see? The car's broken down. Bob, I've not got time for your nonsense today. I've got too much to do. Agnes, just... She's pregnant. It's a boy, Agnes. What you waiting for? Bring them up. What a stroke of luck you finding the farm. We'll get you a nice, cozy bed and plenty to eat. Come on, jump in! That is really kind of you, but we wouldn't want to impose. We just need to use your phone. The trouble is, the storm blew down all the lines. We're waiting for an engineer, but all the roads are blocked. There's trees down everywhere. How about somewhere we might be able to grab a taxi? Taxi? No taxis around here, I'm afraid. Don't worry. We'll get it sorted. Come on, jump in. You go first. Okay. My wife's gonna be over the moon to see you. She loves babies. There they are. The welcoming committee. Hello. Hello. Welcome. You poor souls. Welcome, welcome. - I'm Agnes as you know. - Hello. What a blessing to have you here. Let's get you inside and fed. I just need my bag. David, Luke, fetch the bags, will you? Hello. Just the two bags? It's okay. I can manage them. Not too heavy. Here we are. Honestly, we are so grateful, but we need to find somewhere with a phone. Oh, no. I won't hear of it. It's way too late to go around knocking on doors. Won't be good for the baby. No. We'll find you a phone tomorrow. Don't you worry. You'll sleep very well in here. These beds are very comfy. The bathroom is just along the corridor to the right, and dinner will be in an hour, but I'll give you a call. - Thank you. - Thank you. - What the f... - Shh! What just happened? It's like an episode of The Twilight Zone. The original series. I know. Their clothes and everything. Bless them. Well, you did say you wanted to get away from it all. Yeah, into the countryside, not the 1950s. Beautiful views, though. Oh, yeah. Don't you think the two sons look a bit... nothing like each other? Hmm. Adopted, maybe? And the girl in the woods. Did you see her? - No. - That's why I looked at you in the car. There was this little girl, staring at us in the woods. Really freaky. Huh. First thing in the morning, we are out of here. Even if we have to walk. Will you just relax? It's either this or sleeping in the car. - What is it? - It's that girl again. Well, of course she's gone now. Dinner's served! Here they are. Come in, come in. That's right, take a seat. You're in for a treat. We're having vegetable soup for star... David! Manners. Very sorry. I'm sure you can tell we're not used to guests. So, soup for starters. Followed by roast lamb. Freshly slaughtered, especially for you. - Isn't that right, Bob? - Aye. Barely an hour ago. Still warm when it went in the oven. And that'll be with roast potatoes and vegetables, freshly picked today. - Thank you. - Thank you. - There we are. - Thank you. Greedy boys. I'm very proud of my boys. Fine specimens, don't you think? Yes. Lovely. Don't you be getting any ideas, young lady. They're my boys. Don't you forget that. Bob, please. We thank you, almighty Lord, for the wonderful food you have bestowed upon us, and for the guests you have brought through our door. Who bring with them the most precious gift of all. The gift of life. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Beautiful. Thank you, Bob. You may begin. So, Bob, how long have you and Agnes lived here? I've always lived here. My great-grandparents built this house. - Were they all farmers too? - No. Landowners. Bob's the farmer in the family. Agnes. Yes, dear? Is that your daughter? Yes. Faith. I wondered who she was. She not joining us for dinner? She might. If we're lucky. We adopted Faith a while back. Very sad story. She was abused by her birth parents. Terrible. Terrible people. The ordeal left her virtually mute. She's such a shy wee thing. But, thankfully, God led her to us and we accepted her as one of our own, didn't we, Bob? Yes. Yes we did. David and Luke are adopted too. God didn't grant me the gift of childbirth. He'd a greater purpose for me. And I wouldn't have that any other way. Just look at my beautiful boys. Is there a school in the area? For Faith? No child of mine goes to school. Schools out there aren't good enough for my children. There's no better teacher than a child's mother. There isn't anything we need from out there, is there, Bob? That's true. Everything we need is right here. Except cars, right? We didn't make the Land Rover. And diesel, and stuff. What have I told you about that kind of talk? Our Luke is quite the rebel. - Anything? - No. Jesus Christ. "This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring." We need to get the hell out of here. We're just gonna have to sweat it out till morning. It's not just creepy. It's beyond that. There's something sinister about these people. They're just odd. Eccentric. No. There's something about the little girl. Faith. Why wasn't she at the dinner table? These people would not qualify for adoption. No way. It's an old house. Come and sit down. Great. I need the loo, as per usual. If I'm not back in five minutes, you'll know I've been murdered. What's wrong? It's Faith. I can't get her out of my head. She just seems so familiar. Come and lie down. How are you feeling, anyway? Fine. Just want to go home now. We'll be home by tomorrow lunchtime, I promise. I love you. I love you too. Matt, do you hear that? Matt? My... name... is... Ellie Adams! What? What is it? We need to get out of here. Get help. Rachel, you were dreaming. Faith is Ellie Adams. The whole family went missing. Remember? They were in the news for months. They killed them. Ellie's parents. - You were having a nightmare. - Matt. Listen to me. That girl is Ellie Adams. We need to go. Now. We need to go. Thank you for your hospitality, but we need to be getting on the road now. Come on. What are you doing? We managed to get a signal, and we sent out a text. So people know we are here. What are you doing? No! Get away from him! I said be careful with the baby. Oh, there she is. You just had a big contraction. No wonder you woke up. It won't be long now till the good Lord delivers Jacob to us. It's so exciting. Matt! Where is he? Matt? Now, now. Come on, dear. There's no need to yell. Why are you doing this? Please, just let us go. We won't tell anyone, I promise. Won't tell them what? What have you done with him? Now, I wasn't for the idea myself, but Bob was right. It just wouldn't work. Though I was quite fond of him. A fine young man. He's gone to a much better place. God's kingdom. He's lucky. What are you talking about? What have you done? Matt! Do you ever wonder what your actual mum and dad look like? Shut your cake hole. Well, do you? No. Right, that's deep enough. Drag him over. Ever wonder what would've happened if Mum and Dad hadn't rescued us? Yeah. We'd be sinners, just like the rest of them. Now, shut up, and let's get this done. Would be interesting, though, knowing what they look like, don't you think? Luke, Mom and Dad have devoted their lives to us. It disrespects them to talk like that. You keep it up and I'll tell them. Then you'll know about it. - What you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? - You'll get blood on the clothes. - Mum won't let us wear them. We can wear them in the fields. Wait. Put him in alive. Wait. In case he wants a cigarette when he wakes up. That's it. Nearly there. Come in. Thank you, Luke. If you can just set them down there for me, please. Not been born yet? Can't be too different from lambing, right? Get out! Sorry about that. They mean well. Get your hands off me! Why would you do this? He's coming. Give me my baby. It's a girl. You said it was a boy. Give me my baby! Give me my baby! You can't do this! Help! Rachel! Rachel! So I asked the good Lord why He sent us a girl instead of a boy as He promised. It's all fine. It's all part of the plan. He's wanting to test me. He's got some sense of humor, doesn't he? She's crying for some food, so we best get cracking with that milk of yours. A baby needs his mother's milk. Or her mother's milk. Bob! No! Give me my baby! Bob! Give me my baby! Guys. You... ungrateful whore. Not only did you burden us with another girl, but you attack us in our own home. I should've known. It's typical. It really is. Please. Give me my baby. My... baby! You are sick. You're not well. Please, just let us go. I am begging you. Us? We're the sick ones? How dare you? You... Your world's infected with pornographic images everywhere. Men with men. It's disgusting. I've seen it. You allow your children to parade around virtually naked, worshipping false idols. You're the sick ones. We live the way God intended. We're the light. You killed Ellie's parents. Didn't you? They probably murdered your parents too. Please help me. They are liars. The Bible says, "Do not kill." David! Deuteronomy 13. "If they say 'Let us worship other gods, ' then show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. They must certainly be put to death." And her name is Faith. We saved her and our boys from Satan himself. Just like Faith all over again, isn't it, Bob? Only one place for you. Help! Oh, stop it! For goodness' sake, it's for the baby. Don't you care about her? I need her arms held. That's it. Oh... Ow! No. No! No! No! No! Hey! Hello! Hey! Hey! Help! Hello! Ellie? You're Ellie Adams, aren't you? Thank you for this. Do you remember what happened? To you and your parents. Okay! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can you help me? Help me get away? They chain you up too, don't they? I am so sorry this has happened to you. But I can get you out of here. You just need to try and find something to break this chain. Find something to lever it from the wall. No, no! Wait! Wait! Please come back! Please. He was running away from the polis and fell down the hill, so they cuffed him. Seriously. He's a dafty, isn't he? That's some view, in't it? Um-hm. Right. Time for a pick-me-up. My wee beauty. Yeah. I need to tell you, Big Yin, this is your best stuff yet. Pure, amazing shit. I know I go on about it all the time, but I can't help it. I love the way it makes my mind go the clappers. Know what I mean? Just like, 100 mile an hour. It's great. What did you do that for? What? Talking like it's cocaine or something. It's weed, mate. Weed's a downer. It's not an upper. And what the... Where's the rest? It was good shit. Seriously, mate? How are you even conscious? You're a fucking walloper, you know that? Hey! Do you hear that? Thank God. I need your help. My wife and I, we were taken at gunpoint by this family. Whoa, whoa! That's just close enough, pal. What the fuck? I just... I just need to use your phone. Guys, there's no time. My wife is pregnant and she's in danger. Whoa! Just keep your distance, right, pal? We're not into that kinda shit. So just jog on, all right? Look, this is an emergency. I just need to use your phone. For a minute, please. There's no signal up here, pal. Listen, what you need to do is, you need to ahead about three or four mile... that way. I don't think you understand. These people tried to murder me. They have my wife, she's in danger. I just need you to take me to a nearby village or at least just give me some clothes, so I can find help myself. Please, anything! Do you think we're stupid, pal? You're at it. He's at it. Jog on. You could be telling us anything. Let us go. Let us go, you psycho! I've told you, there's nae signal up here. There's nothing for miles. You can't just leave us here. We've nae water. We'll die. So, which way? Don't you understand your predicament? I don't get help, you don't get help. - There's a road. - Jase, don't. Stu, shut up! There's a road in that direction. Just head down the hill. You'll hit it. Which way, when I get to the road? Head left. - Grab that. - Got it. Cut me free! Cut me free! He's talking about the Fairbairns. Jase, if Bob finds out, we're both in deep shit. I know that, you daft bastard. What choice did I have? Cut me loose. You need to do better than this, young lady. What use are you if you can't feed my baby? Come on, boys. Enter. Well, what is it, boys? We were wondering... Since she isn't gonna be of use. Like you said before, Mum. Yeah, like you said. Before. So, we were thinking... Maybe we could... Because there aren't any girls around here. We could, you know... have her. For us. What on earth are you talking about, you silly boys? For goodness' sake, spit it out. We thought we could go with her. She'd give us a baby boy. Just like you wanted. Maybe that was God's plan all along. What did you say? It's what you want, Mother. We'd be doing this for you. How could you say such a thing? No child of mine will speak such filth! Not in this house! Get out. Get out! What? We shouldn't have said anything. We should've just done it. What they don't know won't hurt them. Yeah. We should do it now. Mum and Dad won't keep her around for much longer after this. Stay by the door. Get away from me. Help me! Help! - Get her legs. - Help me! I was gonna be gentle. Not anymore. Help! Help! Help... Luke. I even dressed for the occasion. Jesus. I thought you were dead. A girl. They have her in the house. Stay back. Careful. Can't believe they would speak to that. For the love of God, keep the door shut! Bob, what is that? I don't know. Go check the shed. What in God's name? Go check the shed now. No. We can't leave without our baby. We have no choice. No, I can't leave her. They have guns, Rachel. We're no good to her dead. Look at me. We need to get away and get help. It's her best chance. Our best chance. Okay? Run. No! My... name... is... Boy or girl? Boy. Terrible people. Terrible.

Agnes, love, they're dead. They're dead. We need to bury them. They're starting to smell. How... dare you? These are my boys. Get out! Get out! Agnes, love, I'm sorry. We need to hand them over. We can't keep Him waiting any longer. How could He take such good boys? I cannot find His teachings in this. They're in a better place now, my love. I bet you they're up there right now, looking down on us. Stood next to the Lord. Arm in arm. No. He should not have done this. He made a mistake. This isn't right. They were good boys. Come on. Let's go. You go back if you want, I'm staying here. Agnes, it's time to go. It's been hours. We need to get back to the baby. And so it begins. It was the same when Faith arrived. Agnes, I love you. No one will ever replace you. You're my girl. And you always will be. Come on. Let's go. I'll make you a cup of tea. I want to be on my own with them. I'll walk home. We need to feed the baby. You feed her! And if she has no more milk, I want her gone. Do you hear me? Come on. Come on. There. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ellie, wait. Oh... Hello, my baby. I am so sorry. It's all right. Hush, now. Where are you? You won't get far! What are you up to? Please don't hurt me or my baby. I'll do as I'm told now. Bob, please. I know you don't want to hurt me. I could've run away, but I didn't. I'll provide milk and I won't be any trouble. If Agnes sees you up here, all hell will break loose. She doesn't want you near the baby. I understand. Okay. Walk straight out the room, put the baby back in the cot. And get you back down to the shed. Don't look, okay? No! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Police. We need help urgently. We've been kidnapped. Held hostage. My husband has been murdered. We found the missing girl, Ellie Adams. They have guns. Please, we need help immediately. Rachel Hopkins. We were driving from... Oh, my God. I don't remember. Um... Can you trace the phone? Fairbairn Farm. That's the name of the farm. Um... Okay. Tell me what else I can do. Five kilometers? Oh, my God, she's here. She has a gun. Hello? Shit. No... Come on. Ellie, listen to me carefully. If I get hurt, you take her and you run to the road, okay? As fast as you can. You keep running until you find help. That's my baby. Ellie, run! Now! No! Get away from her! Rachel. Rachel Hopkins. Can you tell me what's happened? I was shot. Who shot you? A woman. Agnes Fairbairn. Where is she now? She's dead. Hi, there. Can you tell me your name? Rachel. And who's this? She doesn't have a name yet. Can you tell me what happened? Rachel, we need to have a look at the baby. Is that okay? Suspect is down and not moving. Move in. Okay. It's all over. It's all over. Let's get you onto a stretcher now and get you to the hospital. Rachel. Ellie Adams. Can you tell us where she is? She's right here. The girl in the woods, did you see her? No. She not joining us for dinner? She might. If we're lucky. Don't worry, Rachel. We'll find her.
