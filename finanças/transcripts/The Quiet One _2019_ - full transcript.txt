This is my little capsule of my life in here. I suppose if you looked at my bookshelves you would sort of understand me better. I always thought it was important to keep a record of what was going on. I've -- I've always kept records or information of things since I was a-- a little boy in the war. [jazz music] [alarm blaring] I remember standing out in the streets with all the local families and watching the formations of German bombers going over. It was just droning. Just this sound. There was a German fighter bomber roaring up the street towards us firing his guns. [gunfire] As it passed, I ran down the street to where my grandmother was waiting for me. She grabbed me and we ran to go down the back of the stairs to the air raid shelter. [explosion] [droning] And then the silence. You go back to the school, and there were two little girls who was in our class, they weren't there anymore. They got killed. We go to that bomb site where there used to be about 16 houses and find toys and children's books and then we'd get chased off by the air raid men. [instrumental music] My grandmother was like my mother. I mean, she taught me everything. She was wonderful. She started me collectin' things. All kinds of treasured little things. I was collectin' stuff and I made a scrapbook. And then I had to make another scrapbook and another scrapbook. Then I have to get a trunk. And it just kept goin' on and on. Whenever I came into contact with anything that I could claim was mine, I kept it. Throw it in the room here. Throw it in the room. I always wanted to be a musician. I always wanted to be in a band. And I know it was so impossible and so unlikely um, that I would be that I just dismissed it completely from my mind. And, um, suddenly last year.. ...I -- I re -- remembered, you know, after all that time. I suddenly remembered that I'd always wanted to be and now I was, you know. It didn't mean a thing to me anymore. It was a big, it was such a big ambition. It was-- it was unobtainable when I was little. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] I was coming from one of the worst streets in Penge. It was like gang warfare in those days. Most of the boys in Blenheim Road ended up in borstals or prisons and a lot of them went bad. I was really quite ahead of everybody because of what my gran was teaching me. She did whatever she could to bring me up. My mom and my dad were not that kind of people. There was a emptiness, a blankness in 'em. All that working-class stuff that children should be seen and not heard. You felt pushed aside all the time. I never really felt like I had a home, you know. I really didn't. [school bell rings] I went to a grammar school, which was something special you know, in those days, um, coming from a slum street. I was accused of trying to be snobby by my mates in the street and also by my dad. He always tried to insist that I was working class and I should never try to change because that's what I was. My dad pulled me out of school and the headmaster wrote a letter to him. I've got it. I've got the letter. And not only did he pull me out of school he did the worst thing possible. Put me to work in a bettin' shop. He said, "You're gonna contribute to payin' for the house." Because he was a bricklayer, and if he had bad weather in the winter he couldn't work. I returned to live with my grandmother a number of times because I just couldn't get on with my dad at all. [indistinct chatter] I realized I was on me own. Once my grandmother died being loved kind of vanished, really. She died when I was away and I just never.. ...paid her back, really for all the love and affection she gave me and I feel guilty about it. When I was born, she picked me up in-- in her arms and said, "This boy's gonna be world-famous." And everybody laughed including my mom, my dad, my relatives. They all thought it was like a big joke.

We played different music to them. We played in a different way. We played it better than them. Keith had all the licks off. And then you got Mick up front who's just all over the bloody stage with the maracas and the tambourine and all that. The greatest front man there's ever been. [cheering] It was a special band and we could blow anyone off the stage no matter who it was. [cheering] [instrumental music] Bill had a very individual style that wasn't particularly hip or cool but he was his own person. He had a tremendous presence but he didn't impose himself on you. Stone Face, I think people called him or referred to him as Stone Face. He was rake thin and when he smiled, which wasn't that frequently his whole face lit up in a sort of great crease of a smile. And he always had an air of world-weariness. I remember seeing Bill when we first rehearsed up the road in a pub. You know, he'd had a different sort of upbringing. He's locked into an era that was before us, really. So when we got on the road I think it was like liberation for him. I went into the military in '55. Thank God I got the strength when I was in the military to be able to stand up for myself and fight for my beliefs. Before that, I couldn't. [droning] [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] I was posted to Germany. When I got there, I met this great guy who was a genius footballer. His name was Gordon Lee Wyman. He was bit of a rebel. All his clothes were scruffy. And I kind of really liked him for that because we all had to dress tidy and neat otherwise we got a bollocking. But he seemed to get away with it. [airplane droning] He used to be in the refuelin' trucks and he'd open the top when it was being refueled. He'd be smokin' a cigarette and he'd just throw the cigarette in the fuel. [chuckles] He did insane things. When he finished his fag, he just dropped it in there. [intense music] He was like the first person I kind of idolized if you like. He did things his way, and I related to all that. At the beginning of the Stones, I decided to change my name because I'd never liked my name. I officially changed my name in '64 to Bill Wyman. I felt such a relief havin' a different name and it just took a cloud off my head. My dad hated me for it. He thought I was trying to get away from my roots which I kind of was in a way. I mean, it just changed my life. I bought a fleck jacket just to be different, really. I'd have a Tony Curtis haircut hanging down the center there, you know, a curly bit. People used to stare at me in the street and I was proud of that. I was being an odd one out. [radio static] [indistinct chatter on radio] At the barracks, the guys in our room all clubbed together. We bought a radio in town, in Oldenburg, for our room and at last we were able to listen to whatever we wanted mostly through American Forces Radio, AFN. We'd wake up at 5:30 in the morning and listen to "Stickbuddy Jamboree" this fantastic country program. A very big, big, happy howdy to you out there, friends and neighbors. This is your old country buddy Wagon Wheel Willie comin' at you on "Stickbuddy Jamboree." Sit back and relax and enjoy 25 minutes of good country and western recorded music. [country music on radio] Then, of course, shortly after that we heard the beginnings of rock and roll. [singing "Mystery Train"] ♪ Train I ride ♪ I could go to the American PSI shops and buy the first little 45 records. ♪ Train I ride ♪♪ It was just like brand-new music. It just blew me away. And I had to be involved in it. I had to. I went straight down into the Oldenburg town and I bought my first acoustic guitar. When I came out of the military on leave I went to the cinema, the, uh, Regal Cinema in Beckenham with a couple of friends and we saw this film called "Rock, Rock, Rock!" About halfway through, I saw this trio called Johnny Burnette Trio who did this.. ♪ Lonesome train ♪ ...on a lonesome track. ♪ Tum tum lonesome train ♪ A bit like early Elvis. ♪ I'm coming back ♪♪ With all this, you know his mouth a bit twisted like Elvis and all that.

[singing "You Can't Catch Me"] And that just blew my mind. My hair went on the back of my neck. I thought, "Fuckin' hell." It just blew me away. This guy was doin' the duck walk across the stage and shakin' his legs and shudderin'. And the audience are laughing. They thought it was a comedy show or something. And I'm sitting there thinking "This is the most incredible thing that's ever happened to me." It was then that I thought "Well, I've got to form a band." ♪ Get too close you know I'm gone ♪ ♪ Like a cool breeze ♪ I'm out of the military and that's when the Cliftons came into existence. ♪ Wee wee hours ♪ We used to sit in my kitchen with a little tape recorder and just learn all these basic songs. ♪ Here come a flat-top he was moving up with me ♪♪ We used to play all the hits of the day.

You can ask these questions, everybody sends somebody else up. No one wants to say anything. I just messed about with a guitar at home. About three years ago. Three and a half years ago. And eventually formed a group and I had to play bass 'cause nobody else did, did they? - And then I -- - Why do you play bass? Nobody else did. Yeah, because there's more guitarists and less bass players. I went to my sister's house for the weekend and we went to a dance. And I heard the bass. [blues music] I heard the real bass guitar for the first time. The low sound just filled you up right down there, you know when everybody else was playing up high. And I thought, "God, that's what's missing in the Cliftons." And I asked them all. I said, "Steve, you wanna play bass?" "No." "Cliff, do you wanna play bass?" "No." Fucking hell, I suppose I better do it then. He didn't have a bass guitar because he couldn't afford to buy one. What he did was detune two or three of the top strings of an ordinary six-string and he made.. What he made of it was brilliant, you know. And I think we may have all clubbed together to buy the bass guitar. We bought it and it was the most ugly, horrible thing. I turned this bass over, got some chalk and redrew the body. And I went down the road to my friend who had a fret work machine. I said, "I want you to cut all this out." He went, "Are you serious?" I said "Yes, cut it out." [whirring] Took it home, put all new electrics in it. [whirring] I put another pickup in, a Baldwin pickup. Stripped it all down, took all the frets out. Then I had to buy new strings, these framer strings which were really springy and soft. And I bought this amplifier. The fucking thing, every time I touched it I'd get electrocuted because it didn't have an earth or anything. I'd just go, "Ah!" I bought an 18-inch Goodman speaker the biggest speaker there was. And when I played this bass, Jesus, the sound. [imitates bass guitar] I mean, it was amazing. Without knowing it, I invented the fretless bass. [Booker T & the MG's singing "Green Onions"] I heard "Green Onions" by Booker T & the MG's. ♪ Boom doom pa doom doom ♪ ♪ Doom doom pa doom pa doom doom ♪♪ And I thought, "That bass is great." And I started to focus on trying to play bass like Duck Dunn. That's who I learned my basics from. The way to play, to leave space don't be busy, don't fill it up. You're not a fucking lead guitarist you're a bass player. Focus on what the drummer's doin' and play exactly with the drums so that you've got a strong foundation there that's solid, that everybody else can build upon. ♪ Can you handle it? Handle it ♪ ♪ Can you handle it ♪♪ [instrumental music] I'd done gigs with some of the lesser-known musicians of the time. I did have a bit of experience like that but it was all rock and roll. The stuff that we were all listening to they weren't many bass players on any of those records. And I remember seeing Bill playing and thinking "What, a bass player?" And he looked like a Teddy Boy. I thought, "Where's he come from?" You know, his bass playing was fantastic. Really unique. Forming the Cliftons was a breath of fresh air. I'd fallen in love with playing music. We were doing all these gigs and working hard but the trouble was those shite promoters. They owed us so much money, they just wouldn't pay us. And so the bottom started to fall out of the band. Tony Chapman answered an ad for a drummer with an R&B band. That night we went back to Mick's parents' house and they played Jimmy Reid and various things that I'd never heard. I think they quite liked the way I played because I could play the shuffle beat which most people couldn't. And then that's how I got to play with the Stones, really. Tony came to me and said, "Bass player's left. Do you wanna come up to rehearsal on Friday?" So I went up with him and I had my big bass cabinet in the boot of his car stickin' out. I took my homemade bass and I went to the Weatherby Arms in Chelsea. I went in, and there they were, Ian Stewart. He was nice when I went in there. [indistinct chatter] Mick was fairly sociable. [instrumental music] And Brian and Keith just didn't speak to me. They were up at the bar, and they were really beatnik-y. I bought them all a round of drinks and then they got a bit more friendly and -- and passed the cigarettes round. So, then they were sociable, you know. They didn't have any money or anything. They asked me what music I liked and what music I played. So I said, "Well, Chuck Berry," and they went, "Great." "Jerry Lee Lewis." "No!" "Eddie Cochrane." "No!" All the rock and rollers, they didn't like any of them. They said, "We're a blues band, we're not a rock and roll band. We don't play that shit." [The Rolling Stones singing "Mona"] They'd already spoken to Charlie Watts so they fired Tony, and Charlie said he'd join.

It was unheard of in England. I remember saying to them at that rehearsal I said, "We can't play 12-bar blues all fucking night." Which I was totally wrong about because we ended up doing exactly that. Within two months, we were brilliant and sounded fantastic. And in 1963, we played about 340 shows. We traveled everywhere in Stu's van. He was a fantastic blues piano player and he looked after us on the road for 22 years. He was like the sixth Stone, really. Stu would turn around and say "Okay, you three-chord wonders, you're on." ♪ Let's go fishin' in the crawdad hole ♪ ♪ One two three four five and nine ♪ I couldn't survive working because we started to get gigs out of London. ♪ I said hey crawdaddy ♪ ♪ I said hey crawdaddy ♪ ♪ I said hey crawdaddy ♪ ♪ Hey crawdaddy ♪♪ I told my parents and friends that I was gonna give up work and go professional.

[audience cheering] I didn't think of it as progressin' anywhere really big. It was the most excitin' thing in my life. The sound we had, no one compared with that sound in those days, no one. I started to collect the little bits and pieces as we traveled. If I was very lucky, I grabbed a little poster and someone would give me a photo they had taken. And it just slowly escalated into this mountain. You know, it is all a bit of a haze to me. I mean, if I wanna know what I did for certain in those years I have to ask Bill Wyman, you know. - Who keeps the archives. - Yeah. Bill was the first guy to have a computer. He'd have his videos and they'd be all stacked up. I bet he's probably got them even now. He had movie cameras before everybody. I took reels of film. Twenty years of home movies on the road. The biggest ambition we had was to play in a club and have people like what we were playin'. We never dreamed about making a record. It never crossed our minds that we would ever be on TV or radio. Pie in the sky to think we might go abroad sometime because we were playin' uncommercial music. We were playin' pure blues and the only place we could play it was in jazz clubs. Suddenly, we got a followin' and it blossomed from there. Glyn Johns, who was in that band, The Presidents said to us, "I work at IBC Record Studios. I can get you three hours recording time." We went, "What? Make a record?" I'd seen the Rolling Stones and I thought they were really good and I thought, "There's definitely a commercial opportunity here." So I approached the studio owners and said "Can I bring these people in and see what we can do?" And they said, "Yes, on the condition that you have "absolutely nothing to do with getting the deal. We'll do the business." [instrumental music] I took the Stones in and that was their first recording session. We cut four things, I think. Bill and I argue about this. I thought it was only three, but he says it was five. He's probably right because he's got it all written down somewhere. We went and we cut five tracks. The guy who owned the place, Harold Clewson took them around to Decca and EMI and Pi and nobody liked them. And we thought that was the end of our recording careers. It started to happen when Andrew Oldham signed us. I'm proud of most things I did. Just, whether the proudness remains is whether they happen or they don't happen. Um, the biggest thing naturally is the Rolling Stones. Andrew said he saw the sex emanatin' from us and, you know, and all this sort of bullshit the way Andrew talks, which was fantastic 'cause he was a genius. Bill, I didn't pay much attention to and he knows that. Because of being deeply superficial I judged books by their cover and he seemed to be much more of a Duane Eddy Johnny and the Hurricanes type of guy to me than a, than a Bo Diddley guy. Bill might have had moments where he thought not that his life was over, but his life was set. And then along came the Rolling Stones. The phone rings and it's Andrew Oldham saying "Can I speak to Terry O'Neill?" So I speak to him. He said, "Can you do what you did for the Beatles for the Stones?" I said, "Well, I'll give it a try." And that's when I first met Bill. I took the pictures back, and the picture editor said "God, they look like five prehistoric monsters." It was a mania with the Beatles whereas with the Stones, it was an appreciation. It became a cult. [instrumental music] Alright then, this is the Rolling Stones interview for the fan club, December, Christmastime. Mick, Bill and Charlie. When did you first get mobbed? Do you remember that word? - Yeah. - Well, that's a good question. I don't remember, you know. It was like something, I remember -- - I do. - Oh, well, Bill, okay, go on. He remembers everything. I'm trying -- We, the first time we got mobbed.. - Go on, where was it? - This doesn't happen anymore. It was about a third of the way through the Everly Brothers tour. - Really? - Up in the north. It was either in Manchester or Liverpool one of those places. Um, where we were actually attacked for the first time when we tried to get out of the theater. [crowd cheering] Okay, here we go. And now I'd like to introduce to you the fabulous Rolling Stones. [cheering] We'd go on stage and go jan-ta-jan and the whole crowd would pour on stage and that was the end of the show. Two chords, end of the show. And if we got through three songs, it was, like, amazing. [instrumental music] Sometimes they put police dogs on each end of the stage to stop the kids getting on. The police dogs went nuts. [dogs barking] The only way you could get out of the theater in time when you played the last chord of the last song the curtains closed and they had to play "God Save The Queen." [crowd cheering] [instrumental "God Save The Queen"] And the audience had to stand there for those two minutes. And that was the two minutes we had to get off the stage down the corridors, out of the building into the police van or whatever it was the Black Mariah or the ambulance or the newspaper van we were using to be inconspicuous. And gone. Sometimes we didn't get out in time and then we just got mashed. And then we went abroad, fucking hell.

We got in, started the press conference. We were there five minutes, and the kids are breaking the doors down and everything and the police kept bringing reinforcements in to hold the doors and everything at each end. The chief of police came over and he said "We can't hold 'em any longer. You'll have to go." So we had to run out and fight our way through to the bus and then the bus had to fight its way through the crowd. And away we went with an escort of about six police cars and about twenty helmeted and armed police on motorbikes. Unbelievable, you know. I never had my movie camera with me.

It was the first thing you'd hear the thing that was most hooky about it. It was so precise and so contained, you know. It wasn't gettin' away with itself. It was just right. The best informed are the best players and I think Bill's one of those. It's never been pop. It's been rock and roll but it's been informed by blues which is the magical combination. Bill is like no other bass player I've ever heard. He has an incredibly simplistic approach to what he's doing. And I think that's just Bill's complete lack of ego as a musician, really.

Did this originate in Europe? It started when we started in England, you know but, um, by now in England everybody knows what we really are like so they don't write things that are untrue, you know. The Beatles are loved by pretty well everybody from the moms down to the teenagers. It seems to me that you're either loved or hated. Everything we did was so alien to the norm. They just did not get it. Why we didn't succumb to being showbiz-y. All the other bands would succumb to doing what they're told just for that bit of publicity. We didn't need it, we avoided publicity in the end. It was us against the world. It really was. We were just refusing to conform. If a kid wants to let his hair grow long or he wants to wear rags, or he wants to play a guitar or do anything, or kick a ball in the street it's nothing to do with us. If he likes to listen to our music, that's great if he wants to come to a concert. But apart from that, we didn't believe we had any responsibility. I always thought he didn't like me being in the Stones 'cause he never said anything nice. He was always moaning about it. I just don't think that generation could get into their head that their kids could be successful in something that wasn't a normal job. So when I succeeded playing music a -- and doing better than them it was out of order, wasn't it? But my mom did tell me on a couple of occasions when t -- they were in the pub uh, when someone was going on about "Stones, dirty lot," he would stick up for us. He'd tell them to mind their own business. And so he did it without my knowledge but he never did it to my face. But he wasn't that kind of a person. I mean, looking back, I don't blame him because he -- he had a terrible childhood. A really terrible childhood. Everything was changin' in those early '60s.

[crowd cheering] There was probably an addiction to sex because I wasn't addicted to drugs and I wasn't addicted to wine. My first marriage, it never worked. It was down to the same old thing of marrying the girl next door was the phrase. Getting married got me out of the family. Of course, it did, out of the home. It was hard coming home to my wife who obviously knew what was going on. But then I found at one time, she had a relationship going. I mean, obviously, I don't blame her. And then you end up with a child out of the blue and you just stay together for the sake of the child which is always the worst thing you can do. Until I finally got divorced. She insisted that she would take Stephen to South Africa with her, which really hurt me. But then I thought, "Well, it's better that he grows up with one parent in a normal way of life." If it isn't with me, then it has to be with her. I'll get Stephen to say something to you. Just a minute. Come and say hello to Dave. Come and say hello to Dave. - Hello. - Say hello, Dave. - Hello. - Say how are you? How are you? I will see you soon. Bye-bye. He came back in the summer of '68.

And then I had to fight for him and a divorce. I went to the court and the judge gave me custody, which was a miracle. And from that day on, I brought Stephen up. I broke up from my wife. Astrid, my girlfriend, moved in with me. I'd met her by then. We arrived at this gate and a gardener came with a shotgun broken off and said, "What do you want?" And we said, "Is this Gedding Hall?" And he said, "Yes." And I said, "We understand that the place is goin' up for sale tomorrow. Could we have a look?" And he said, "Well, the owners are not here but I'll show you 'round the outside." And I saw this unbelievable house which I just couldn't believe. Oh, God, it was extraordinary. The owner was Jeff Allen. He took me into the lounge for a cup of tea and I saw a 10 by 8 photo on the top of the TV of Ronnie, Reggie and Charlie Kray saying "Love to Jeff from the boys." "Uh, what's that, Mr. Allen?" He says, "Oh, they -- they're the Krays. They're friends of mine. They're nice lads." I found later that he was a godfather and he would invest their money in country houses and stuff but that's another story. I asked him how much he wanted for the property and it was 45,000 pounds. After being a top band for five years we didn't have money. Money always seemed to vanish. Jeff, bless him, did a deal and let me have it for a price I could afford. He said, "I'll tell you what. "I admire you. You're a self-made man like me. "I come from the east end of London, you come from London. It's yours." It's a wonderful place. I mean, my soul is there, I think. I'm never happier than when I'm there. So when the drug busts were coming in '67 I was just reading it in the press. Mr. Jagger accused of allowing his home at West Wittering to be used for the purpose of smoking cannabis resin, better known as hashish. And after the three-minute hearing, Jones came out through the back of the court and drove away crouching down on the rear seat of a car. I honestly didn't know whether who was gonna be in jail what week and who was gonna be in the studio. I didn't want anything to do with drugs. I didn't confront it with them. I just ignored it, stepped away from it and got stuck into what I wanted to do. I was avoiding facing their problem because it wasn't my problem. So I was living two lives, really. Once, I had a puff of some bloody joint they had. Apparently, it had elephant tranquilizer in it. I went down this corridor and there was someone coming towards me that I kind of vaguely knew so I stopped and chatted to them for about 10 or 15 minutes. And then I looked up again and it was me. I was looking in the mirror. And I thought, "I don't fucking need this." I have to have my feet on the ground. I can't go floatin' off. The emptiness underneath me terrifies me. I've got a phobia about it. Most people think there's something else on the other side of the street which they're not experiencin' and so they wanna go there and try it out, don't they? So if you look at any band and I mean any band from the mid '60s you've got losses. Every band. Searching for something that really ain't there. Brian was a typical example of that. I was really sad when Brian started to, uh, fall to bits basically. We'd be in LA and we'd go out to the clubs and he'd be on LSD. And he -- he'd be getting out the limo and going "Oh, look, there's snakes all over the ground." He'd be jumping about all over the ground. Fucking hell, Brian. You know, "The ceiling's on fire." Oh, yeah. Yeah, it certainly is, Brian. I just used to let him get on with it, but, um he would go off on those tangents a lot. He was thrown out of the band and he died a month later. Charlie phoned me up. He just said, "Brian died." I couldn't believe it, you know. The press was so bad at the funeral. I mean, everybody's around the grave, you know and they're -- they're putting the coffin in and all that and the, the preacher's reading -- reading out and, like, all his family and relatives are all, like, tranquillized and everything. Everybody's crying and upset. There's thousands of fans everywhere. And there's kids running up to you asking for autographs, you know. And, uh, there's press guys with cameras everywhere like all leaning over you and getting snaps in the.. Oh, man, it was really sick. There's...movies going and all that, you know. There was no respect at all. And when he went, it really sort of got me bad. Somebody a bit special. That planned Hyde Park concert ended up being a bit of a memorial to Brian because of his death two days earlier. An English park on a Saturday afternoon July 5, 1969. There must be 200,000 people here, youngsters. In about another hour, I should imagine there will be a quarter of a million. And it was extraordinary that day. [crowd cheering] Alright! [singing "I'm Yours And I'm Hers"] ♪ You know I'm yours and I'm hers ♪ ♪ Somebody else's too ♪ ♪ You know I'm yours and I'm hers ♪♪ It was Mick Taylor's first show with us. That must have been a staggerin' thing for him. The first gig with a band and you're playin' half a million people. From every direction I looked at there were just heads and it was just like a carpet of different colored hair. That's what I could explain it as. The whole day was wonderful. There was no -- no violence, no fights, no drugs, no.. It just went like a dream. That autumn, we set off on a tour of America with Mick Taylor and it was a wonderful tour. The future of the band was looking very healthy and positive. You didn't have so much of the screamin' or very little of it, and people were listening. And then came Altamont. We wanted to repeat Hyde Park in America as a thank you to the US fans. Okay, it's definitely on. The Rolling Stones are not going to appear at the, uh, raceway in Sonoma. They've decided now they're going to hold the concert with the Grateful Dead, the Jefferson Airplane, Santana and, of course, the Rolling Stones at Altamont Speedway which is halfway between Tracy and Livermore. What you do is you catch Highway 80.. I don't really like talking about Altamont 'cause it was such an awful, awful, awful event. The violence just never stopped. And we kept trying to stop it, and we knew if we just walked off the stage, it'd probably be worse. So we hung on and tried to cool people out and it didn't work. Four people in the audience, uh, died one of them from stab wounds, and the argument goes on about how and what is to blame for that or how that could have been prevented, I should say. Sometimes things get out of control and you can't do anything about it. It was the death of the '60s, that's what they called it. The death of the '60s. It was, really. It was the time when the Stones could have just died and they nearly did. [The Rolling Stones singing "You Can't Always Get"] By 1970, we all owed around about 100,000 pounds to the Inland Revenue which we thought had been paid. Tax with the labor government was between 83 and 93%. There was no way we could possibly earn enough money to pay it back. ♪ I saw her today ♪ It was impossible for us to stay in England and so we had to go to France. ♪ A glass of wine in her hand ♪ And then, of course, we became the very first tax exiles. ♪ I knew she was gonna meet her connection ♪ It was difficult.

They don't have the chance of moving on to improve their situation. ♪ You can't always get what you want ♪ But I hated leaving England. I hated it. But we were told there was no alternative. [plane whirring] When I left that mornin' and I left my mom and dad there and my son, Stephen I was tearful, and I really didn't wanna go. ♪ Fair share of abuse ♪♪ I was sure I wasn't gonna like living in France. [instrumental music] People thought we all went and lived in the same house. [chuckles] We had to look for somewhere to record because, you know, we needed a new record. And in the end, we never found anything. We have to go to Keith's house to do it. Keith insists, otherwise Keith ain't ever gonna go to the session, you know. That's where we recorded Exile On Main Street. We did it in the basement of his house. It was a sad time because everybody just got absorbed in takin' drugs. I didn't want it. I didn't want anything of it, apart from the music. [The Rolling Stones singing "Hip Shake"] ♪ I wanna tell you about a dance ♪♪ We were in this basement, which was like an oven. And there's pictures of us lying on the floor, you know. Whatever inconveniences, whatever things were impossible to deal with sometimes, it worked. We were dynamite. Un -- unbeatable, really. Title five, take one. [instrumental music] Last week, New York City finally got to see and hear the Rolling Stones. We were the last stop on a tour that I'm sure most of you have heard about. Would you ever do 30 cities again in that amount of time if it were up to you? As long as I get a holiday, you know. There's never been so much energy as on this tour. If the Stones broke up I don't wanna start any rumors 'cause there aren't any but if they did, say, next week after this tour what would you do? You know, I always tried to live a normal life when I would finished recording or finished touring or finished the concert or whatever it was I'd go back and try to be normal. We managed to build finances and be able to pay our taxes and still have money. And then, of course, it opened me to a whole new life here. [instrumental music] You've got a lovely suntan. This presumably is, uh, south of France suntan because that's where you're living now, is it not? Yeah, that's my French look. What do you do when you're there apart from sunbathe? In France, there are so many different people to -- to mix with and, uh, I meet with quite a lot of them and going to art exhibitions, all kinds of stuff. It's really nice. And I did meet Andre Verde who was the one that introduced me to artists and poets and writers and sculptors. And you would go to the little dinners in the local restaurants. It became a lovely little family. And then I met Jimmy Baldwin, fucking hell. I met him at the Colombe d'Or. I'd go to his house and I realized how much he loved Ray Charles. And I didn't know a lot about Ray Charles. I'd seen a Ray Charles concert with Keith and Charlie in '64 in England. I said to Jimmy, "Can I borrow some of your Ray Charles' records?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "I'll bring them up to your house." And, God, over the next few days I just played Ray Charles nonstop and he became my favorite musician of the 20th century. Then Andre Verde invited me to go to Marc Chagall's house. "You mean Marc Chagall, the painter?" He said, "Yeah, yeah." He was absolutely wonderful. He said, "Your long hair, not original, change it." I said, "But we were the first band with long hair." He said, "Oh, that's okay then. Then you are the originals." [chuckles] I was friends with him for the last eight years of his life. I got to know the -- the simple way he lived. You don't avoid all them little things. They're all part of living, aren't they? Of course, then you enjoy the bigger things better if you deal with the little things. [chopper whirring] [crowd cheering] [audience clapping] [The Rolling Stones singing "Brown Sugar"] So what's the purpose of doing the tour? Oh, I got fed up with gardening. Oh, man, the Rolling Stones are just it, you know. What do you mean? They're the greatest rock and roll band in the world. ♪ Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields ♪ ♪ Sold in the market down in New Orleans ♪ ♪ Scarred old slaver knows he's doin' alright ♪ ♪ Hear him whip the women just around midnight ♪ ♪ Brown sugar how come you taste so good? ♪ ♪ Brown sugar ♪ ♪ Just like a good boy should ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah yeah woo ♪ ♪ Just like a just like a black boy should ♪♪ [fireworks] On a personal sense, Bill, is it difficult in -- in some respects being a Rolling Stone in terms of -- of the pressure that -- That's difficult for a start, but carry on. In terms of the pressure in the sense that that brings on you as an individual? There's a lot of difficulties, uh.. I think the main difficulty in being a Rolling Stone is to pursue your other interests. [Bill Wyman singing "Monkey Grip"] I did the first solo album of a Stone in '73 called Monkey Grip. ♪ Good old monkey grip monkey grip ♪ ♪ Monkey grip monkey grip ♪♪ I was regarded as bass player of the Rolling Stones. I was not expected to be anything else or to do anything else. You really had to go out there and try to prove yourself. You did an album back in '74 with Buddy Guy uh, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells who were two of the original Chicago Blues Brothers. I was just asked to get a rhythm section together to play with them at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. I got this phone call from Claude Nobbs. He said, "I'd like to invite you "to the Montreux Jazz Festival "because I've got Muddy Waters "and he hasn't got a band or anything. "Do you think you could put a little rhythm section together?" We just loaded up, and I drove to Switzerland. ♪ Gonna make pretty women ♪ ♪ Jump and shout ♪ ♪ Then the world wanna know ♪ ♪ What's this all about ♪ ♪ But they'll know I'm here ♪ ♪ Everybody knows I'm here ♪♪ Buddy Guy and Junior Wells are sittin' on the side listenin' to us and Buddy says, "Can you be our support band?" I said, "Yeah, yeah." ♪ The thing that I think I would do ♪ ♪ Ooh no one will never know ♪♪ We went there to back up Muddy Waters. So I needed that bass player to fill every missed note which I still do. Every note I missed, I wanted him to...fill in for me 'cause I was missin' a lot of notes back then. Somebody like him can get the word out faster than I can. People still look at those guys as the greatest rock and roll band that ever played. [cheering] [instrumental music] Glyn Johns rings up and says, "Bill, are you interested in doing a session tomorrow for me?" He says, "I need you to play with Howlin' Wolf." I went, "What? Howlin' Wolf? Bloody hell, put me in. Who else is on?" And he says, "Well, I've got Charlie." And I thought, "Oh, fantastic." "And Eric Clapton. It will be the three of you." I went, "Oh, God almighty. I'd love it, yes." ♪ Well I got a little red rooster ♪ ♪ Too lazy to crow for day ♪ And so I went down the next day met up with everybody and said hello to Wolf. Bloody hell. I was saying hello to my hero. Alright, let -- let everybody get together then and we'll try to make it. Wolf had a voice that, uh, nobody else had. Oh, man, come on, he.. He ain't got nothin' to do but count off. Alright, let's get on it. It was wonderful to do it with Wolf and meet his family. He was a lovely man, he was so gentle. He was this gentle giant. He was terrifying to look at and to be around. Those moments are there to be caught. But you're bloody lucky most times if you catch 'em. ♪ Too lazy to crow for day ♪♪ We got the message from the office that Mick Taylor said I've left. Fuck, now we were just gonna start recording.

I don't know. Just playing together. All -- all the memories and all the places, the people. Uh, I can't -- I can't explain it.

[singing "When The Whip Comes Down"] ♪ Mama and papa told me I was crazy to stay ♪ ♪ I was a fag in New York I was gay ♪♪ In July '78, I tripped on some cables and fell about 6 or 7 feet with my guitar and was knocked out. Everybody else had gone and then suddenly realized that I was nowhere around. So people came back and just saw my silver boots stickin' out through the curtain. And for the rest of that tour, I had to play with two central fingers strapped up. '81, we toured America. Massive tour of America, it was wonderful. [crowd cheering] [The Rolling Stones singing "Miss You"] '82, we toured Europe. Same thing. Also massive and wonderful. ♪ I've been holding out so long ♪ ♪ I've been sleeping all alone ♪ ♪ Girl I miss you ♪♪ And then nothing happened. Mick and Keith started arguing and fighting about God knows what. We never played a gig for seven years. In the meantime, I started to look out for myself. [instrumental "Je Suis Un Rock Star"] Great, let's break and, uh, have some tea and then we'll come up and listen to it again all the way through, shall we? That's good. That sounds really good to me. Everybody wants to do a solo album, but not seriously. So I sat down and, uh, started writin'. I -- I made up little cassettes at home on this terrible little tape recorder I've got not a ReVox or anything sophisticated. When I did "Je Suis Un Rock Star," everything went crazy. ♪ Je suis un rock star ♪ ♪ Je avais un residence ♪ ♪ Je habiter la ♪ ♪ A la south of France ♪ ♪ Voulez vous ♪ ♪ Partir with me? ♪ ♪ And come and rester la with me in France ♪ Playing the single now. That is Bill Wyman, "Si, Si, Chay Suis Un Rock Star." Am I saying that right, Bill? "Je Suis Un Rock Star." I am a rock star, yeah. I don't believe it. I mean, I'm not serious. Currently in Europe, your single is, uh in the top ten, right? In -- In England? Yeah, it's gone top 15 in every country so far and I'm really pleased with it. I'm very naively excited about having a hit record just like I was in '63 with the Stones. It's -- it's like Christmas. ♪ Je avais un residence ♪♪ Tell me, Bill, is it different when a superstar goes to the men's room than for your average ordinary person? Um, yeah. What's the difference? - You have a super pee. - Super pee. [instrumental music] Everybody thought that our life was so romantic and wonderful and exciting and all that. It was for two hours, if you were on stage. The rest of the time was boredom. It's very difficult to keep your sanity, actually. You moved away from all your friends. You were always traveling. You're always on the road, you know. So it's forever changin'. Nothing's kind of permanent. There was no time. I mean, you looked around suddenly and you hadn't seen your cousin Peter for two years and even brothers and sisters you almost lose touch with because you're -- you're livin' in a different world. I got this invite to go to this event and there was all these people dancing in the front. I saw this beautiful girl with her hair up. I spoke to her and found her name was Mandy Smith. It was from the heart. It wasn't from, like, lust or anything like that which people was seeing it as. [indistinct chatter] Bill, were you in any way, were you in any way hesitant having been a bachelor boy for so long or free -- free spirit for so long were you very hesitant about taking the months of marriage again? No, I always thought she was the right girl from the moment I met her, but it was just the wrong time. She was too young. I thought she had to go out and see life a bit before she could make that kind of a decision. He is the rebel Rolling Stone but their wedding blessing today could not have been more traditional. They both said they wouldn't feel married without the formalities of a church service. And those they had, right down to the confettis. When we first met each other, actually. When, like, years ago, we wanted to get married but obviously we couldn't. The things work out in the end if they're right and we always thought it was right since the beginning and, uh, here we are. I was really stupid to ever think it could possibly work. Two sad marriages, really and I decided it was time I got my fucking life in order. Five, four, three, two, one. Fire.

I just sat back and I thought this is a nice time to end my career with the Rolling Stones, on a big high. So I left. [instrumental music] All those 31 years with the band I -- I absolutely loved what we did loved what we achieved. But I needed to sort out my personal life and my future. There's a very happy bird up there. [chuckles] [instrumental music] It's fantastic. They're really cute little butterflies. ♪ Love is such a wonderful thing ♪ ♪ When you need it ♪ ♪ Look around for it ♪ ♪ Love is such a wonderful thing ♪♪ Go on, you go. You've got a better memory than me on those days. - Oh, yeah. Why? - The romantic moments. Yeah, why do you forget all the romantic moments? I do. I -- I remember all the other stuff. You remember all the facts, but you forget all the romantic moments. Yeah. Suzanne and I met in 1979 and she became the inspiration for "Je Suis Un Rock Star." - Can you see me in there? - Can you say famous? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hi. We are cliche. I was a model, he was a musician. He was with a photographer, I was quite bored at the party and I thought I should probably go up and talk to this photographer. And Bill started to chat me up and I started to -- to talk about music askin' him why he was so interested in music. And I felt kind of bad that I didn't recognize him. And that's Matilda. We got you. Can we use your paintbrushes? I guess so. It's a bit late now, isn't it? Oh, we'll have to get these eggs. When we decided to get married, it was to have a family. He wanted to start life over again. He just wanted to have a normal life. He wanted to be able to walk down the street and be able to go to a movie theater without being bothered. He just wanted to know what that felt like. Yeah, so.. Shh. [laughs] When we got married and when we had the kids it gave him time. I think time is his foundation and he wants to use all this time in a very productive way. He just has this need to almost relive what he experienced and put it in some sort of order and find out who he really was and what he'd gone through. So he started to dig out the old boxes scannin' things.. ...and really started to look at it as a life's work ahead of him that he had to complete. I think when he works on the archive, it inspires him. It's almost like he has a treasure and he wants to share it with someone else. [instrumental music] And I decided to play music again. [blues music] Forming the Rhythm Kings enabled me to play with a whole variety of wonderful musicians and dig into the roots of -- of music finding a lot of early stuff which had been forgotten about and reviving it. [blues music] Do you mind, sir, putting that down? We can't have that going on here. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] The atmosphere on the bus, it's like, uh, it's a family. He likes being around players. He likes the jokes. All his life, he's been a working player. Bill is the kind of artist who wants to do the music but he doesn't necessarily have to have all the adulation for it. He's playing his music for himself. You have to have that courage to take that other road to be yourself, to find yourself because you can get lost in this road to stardom. I mean, you really can, and that's all you have and then maybe at the end of your life, you're like "Wow, I wish I had, you know, taken a few moments to stop and smell the roses." And I don't think that Bill will ever say that. I think he has been able to not only smell them but name them. [chuckles] To have gone through that life experience and still be very rooted, really the child of the 1940s I mean, you're looking at old England with this guy. People only really get bothered by fame or it disturbs them is when they start acting famous. I don't think Bill ever started acting famous. I can get by on things we do and, uh, some better than average better than some and worse than some. But, uh, you can always learn and you never become as good as you'd like to. I don't think, no matter what you play. [Ray Charles singing "Georgia On My Mind"] ♪ Georgia Georgia ♪ Ray Charles was playing at the South Bank. And halfway through the concert, Ray Charles decides to do "Georgia On My Mind" on the piano and he dismisses the band and the Raylettes and everyone and he's by himself on the stage, and he starts.. ♪ Georgia da da da Georgia ♪ And it was so emotional. The whole audience, 4000 people in tears. With Ray Charles, and I thought "No one, no one gets an audience like that, you know, except him." It was amazing. And, uh, anyway, the concert finished. See, I get emotional because it was so fantastic. It finished, and the people, and my friends said "Can we go backstage and meet him?" And I went.. [clicks tongue] I said, "Musicians, they don't really like people "coming backstage when they've just come offstage. "They're exhausted, and they're tired, and they're sweaty and they just wanna have a break and all that." So I said, "No, I'd rather not." They said, "Alright, but just stay here until the audience go and then we can go quieter out." While we were waiting there, someone came from backstage, and they came over and said, um "Mr. Charles knows you're here and he wants to invite you." Because you admire him more than any other musician don't you, yeah? [chuckles] [clears throat] You know, it was, it was a fantastic moment. - Just wait a minute. - It's okay. Ah! Leave it a minute. [clears throat] So.. Yeah, he, uh.. We went backstage and met him. He was...fantastic. - I can't do it, sorry. - Anyhow, they asked him.. Ray Charles asked him if he would play on his next album and -- - And I chickened out. - He just said how could I -- I said, "I'm not good enough." That's what he.. Yeah. You just, well, you didn't say it to his face -- - I did. - Did you really? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. I didn't know that. - Yeah. - And what did he say?
