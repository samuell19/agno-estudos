They may be pretty tired after a long day in the field And that's have a heavy load of hay I guess you're right When I get out to the enchantered forest I'm going to ask the Princess to give me two fast white chargers. And we'll ride across the forest moonbeam like the wind Giddy up ! Easy, now You think you'd better wait and ask the princess ?

You don't believe me Sure I do Sometime i,d like to meet her myself The princess is going to give me a magnificent gold carriage Laddie ! Laddie ! Get over you fool! Sorry Mr Pryor. Why didn't you move over? Father, please... I turned the wagon as quickly as you can a carriage well if you can't handle your horses you don't business driving them. Well, wait a minute Law gives the right away to a man with a wagon load But law no law Next time, you'd better look out. You concrete clodhopper ! The Pryors aren't very nice neighbors are they? The Pryors live differently than we do. I'm disappointed in the princess too. Pamela Pryor... Is she your princess? All that thing's a pretending. She isn't really a princess, but she looks like one. Yes, I've noticed that before Now girls you mustn't be too hard on the Pryors. Well I don't know what Mr. Pryor's meaning saying his wife was undisposed Undisposed, nothing I saw her with my own eyes today in the upstairs window looking as well as I do Away Mr. Pryor the princess drove by leEt is standing on the porch English people... What a difference between reserved and downright in politeness One ought to tell them we won the revolution. Well, we did our part We,ve been neighbourly Oh mother you take the minister's sermons too seriously And just think, I might have been out in the woods working on my nature studies. Where? In Peter Dover farm? After all, romance is a part of nature study. Make her stop mother. Sherry, I think we baked all those cookies for the Pryors. don't worry I'll see that they're not wasted you put a hand on those cookies Leon oh just because you're all mad at the Pryors you need to take it up me Mad at the Pryors ?

Victor Pryor was driving like mad. - I wanna talk to you little sister - Not now You don't wanna be a clucking hen like Shelly and Sally do you? No, but i,d like to listen. That ain't good. You should do as mother does listen a lot and don't say very much. Wanna ask you a favor little sister. Sure. Remember you told me about your walks in the woods How you saw the princess in the Enchanted Forest? Do you believe in fairy tales? Can we pretend? I don't know. It's gonna be awful hard after the way she acted. Maybe I could think of another princess. No... no, I think I prefer this one. It's a shame. I'm not so fond of this one anymore. Well, I am... I mean... If you should ever see her you in your walks in the woods... You'd like to meet her? That's right. You wanted to keep the secret An important one. Cross my heart. - Good! - Hé!

Thank you Princess. - Hé! - Harry come back here, there you are. - Hello - Hello. - Who are you? - Little sister That's what Laddie calls me That's not my name. You know who I am? Of course, you're Pamela Pryor, And you're english and you live on the farm next to ours. Is your mother really sick, or she just pretending cuz she don't want to see me She really is sick. She has heart trouble I'm sorry. But the mother will be glad to know she's really sick cuz she's on... What? Well... You're not our very neighboured family, aren't you? No... we're not. You can call me little sister if you like. Thank you little sister. Would you like a cookie? Yes, thank you. What you're doing in the woods all alone? I'm looking for someone. Who? I guess it's you. After all, people do call you the princess. They do? They say: "There goes the princess" But Laddie says "There goes the princess" Laddie who? That's my big brother. You saw him when your father almost ran him down. I'm sorry. My father's temper gets the best of him sometimes. Your brother's very nice. Then it's all settled What is? Well, he thinks you're nice. And you think he's nice. Now you both can see each other. I'm afraid we can't I don't understand grown-ups. They make things so mixed-up. Perhaps you'll understand when you grow up.

Mrs. Peter Stover Come on, Little sister. Pamela This afternoon when Sally and Peter were getting married, Did you wonder how it'd feel to stand up in front of an altar like this? With the minister saying Pamela Pryor, Wilt thou take this good-for-nothing man to be thy lawful wedded husband? I will Laddie Stanton Wilt thou take this beautiful woman, who's entirely too good for you, to be thy lawful wedded wife I will I now pronounce you... man and wife. Laddie? Princess? they're waiting for you You're holding up everything. Did you see what I saw? Leon? Little sister? Well did you think Sally has forgotten all about you? I haven't thought! Come on sit down and get to work Come on, come on! But... But we're really not hungry. That's right. With all the excitement, We kind of lost our appetite Oh? That was only the excitement was it? Well you come along and start eating and don't you leave a thing on your plates or I'll tell your mother And I saved you some of the nice white breast for you. Laddie we can't go through with this. We must. Protect your father you are afraid of isn't it? Yes... Pamela how do you know what is gonna say? I know cause he's even tried to keep me from going to church. He has more meaning than anyone. Well that may be just family pride. - No one,s good enough for his only child. - But I'm not... I'm not what? I'm not his only child. We never speak of it but... Father lost a son in England. That's why we came to America. That isn't easy to get over. But don't you see dear, that explains his whole attitude he's afraid of losing you too. - Maybe - No maybe about it That simplifies everything. i,d just tell him that there,s no danger because we'll be living practically right next door. No, Laddie... Yes, Pamela. Laddie, if you love me... That's just him. - I do love you - Please Ah, Pamela, - How'd you do? - Good evening Sir. Father, this is Laddie Stanton Yes, I know well that Thank you young man for escorting my daughter home Just a moment Sir i,d like to speak to you if I may You'd better go inside Pamela It's getting chilly - Father... - Your mother needs you too Now what can I do for you? Mr Pryor, I'm here to ask a very great favour of you. One that I didn't ask lightly and one that you may not grant with deep consideration Ever since your daughter first honored me with her friendship, I've been anxious to meet you and to obtain your permission Yes, yes... My daughter's already asked me about the church party Unfortunately she,ll be unable to attend That isn't what I was talking about What were you talking about? Truth of the matter is that I love her What did you say? I love your daughter And i,d like your permission to marry her You? Marry my daughter? That's ridiculous. Mr. Pryor... I don't will discuss the matter further. The idea is preposterous and unthinkable I know how you must feel But it won't be like losing Pamela I even thought that eventually you might let me In some measure... take the place of your son. My son? What do you know about my son? Only that you lost a son in England If I did... What's that to you? Are you trying to mock me? No sir. Well I want no son you hear? If I did I wouldn't choose a clodhopper like you You impudent young yokel! You'd like to take the place of my son? You and your upstart family You leave my family out of this Why should I? Haven't you been whining round here with your insolence suggestions? If you weren't her father i,d... Get out! Get out! And if I catch you around here again I'll have you thrown out! You farmer! My son... Pamela, I've been wanting to see you I've been waiting every day in the forest clearing hoping that you'd come I've wanted to see you too Father hardly lets me out of the house Laddie, what are we going to do? Pamela... We love each other That's all that really counts - Let's get married anyway - No No, I couldn't do that without father's consent he's been hurt too much already What happened to him in England made him a changed man I wish we could change him back Maybe he wouldn't be so infernally stiff neck Oh Laddie you mustn't talk about father like that Did you hear what he called me? Well he... He called you a farmer I didn't like the way you said it either Laddie Have you ever considered anything else? Like going into a profession? I considered it and rejected it But you have the education I know you'd make good Why don't you try politics? Or law? I've tried law I worked a couple of summers in Chicago Laddie, you never told me I don't even like a thing about it Closed in office Stuffy streets, houses jammed up together Musty old courtrooms Digging in other people,s troubles Personally i,d rather dig in a good clean earth What's the matter with farming anyway? Even your father runs a farm don't you see? Owning a farm... working one... Well, there is a difference A farmer isn't a gentleman Not exactly, But I thought if you could do something else, well... Why didn't you mention this before? You know what I was all along, It never seemed to make any difference to you Now, you wanna change me You want to change everything about me Just your work Laddie Only because of father - But look... - I must go Laddie I can't stay any longer But think it over, will you? Please You'll make things so much easy For what we are about to receive may we be doing thankful... Amen. Sarah bring the coffee - You've washed your hands Leon? - Yes Mother Tie your nap round your neck Father... I was talking to Wilson at the bank and he told me that forty acres are joining our West eighties for sale Well, that's part of Pryor's land isn't it? Yes sir And I wanna buy it You do Laddie? Yes I've saved enough money Anyway, someday, I want a farm of my own What's happened son? Nothing much mother I asked Mr. Pryor permission to marry Pamela Laddie! Oh Laddie, I've just lost Sally don't worry I was told that a farmer wasn't a gentleman Well, I never What about your father? he's been farmer for 30 years I think I'll step over and have a few quiet words with Mr Pryor This is my role father If Mr Pryor thinks he can make me ashamed of what I am he's badly mistaken And I'm gonna buy some of his own land and show him that it was put there and grow crops Produce food and make money Well, show him Sit down little sister Good luck son Thank you Father Eat your purridge But Charles, you must consider Pamela,s future I'm looking after future But not her happiness You don't realize how you've let this trouble prey on your mind I never think of it at dinner That's all you do think of Charles Remember he was my son too But we also have a daughter I don't see why her life has to be ruined Just because Robert got into trouble - Good morning mother - Good morning - Father - Good morning ♫ Bringing in the shades, bringing in the shades ♫ ♫ We keep on rejoicing Bringing in the shades ♫ ♫ Sowing in the morning... ♫ Who is it making that infernal noise? Can't it be Thomas? Thomas went to town early this morning ♫ Bringing in the shades, bringing in the shades ♫ ♫ We shall come rejoicing bringing in the shades ♫ ♫ Going in the morning sowing seeds of pines let's ♫ This is this young Puppy! he's actually plowing on my land! Charles please... Father, this land was for sale, he might have bought it Where did a bankhead like that get the money to buy land? I'm gonna shut him out so he,ll never sing again as long as he lives Oh mother... - Ruined - No darling, you know your father Not father, Laddie! Laddie ruined everything ♫ Bringing in the shades... ♫ You, young... Take this out of my land! I'll get my dogs on you You know what your dogs will do? They,ll eat right out of my hand I've been feeding them for months You've what? I've made friends with them Making friends is easy; wouldn't you like to try? This is the last straw You... you... Clodhopper? Get off my land! I'm on my own land I bought it from the bank The bank doesn't own it the deeds got to come from me and I won't sell to you! Now, get out! Mr Pryor... This land is the whole difference between you and me That's why I wanted it I wanted to show you the real meaning of it That's good land And it should be growing crops You've never put a plow in an inch of it You need us farmers to produce the very food that you eat I pay for what I need And you need what we grow We can get along without you But you can't get along without us. The other night you called me a farmer And I want you to know that you're right I am a farmer and I'm proud of it! I've plowed straight furrows I've sowed good seeds I've watched my crops grow I've gathered in my harvest And I know that there,s no finer thing a man can do on this green earth Well, perharps, you're right Oh poppycock I don't care what you are I wasted enough time listening to you now take your blasted horses and leave at once! Otherwise, I'll be the worst for you! This land is no longer for sale Laddie! Laddie! Has anything happened here? Plenty I had a talk with Mr. Pryor Father... Now Charles, try and finish your breakfast I'll give you a fresh cup of tea What did he say to you Charles? My dear Anna, He stood up to me What are we gonna do now? I wish I knew Maybe the princess would appreciate you're calling on her Well now she probably never wants to see me again You're wrong lady... Here she comes! Laddie... How could you've done such a thing? You must have known that it would spoil every chance that we had with father I didn't know we had a chance with him Well, we haven't now He,ll never forgive you What do you want me to do? Play doormat for your father to walk? Oh I wanted you to wait and have a little patience until we could try to work things out We might have found a way I suppose I could have become a gentleman Well what have you gained by this ploughing exhibition - At least I've shown your father... - Yes you've shown him You've shown him that you're just stubborn as he is Pamela! Aren't you gonna marry her Laddie? she's other way round I'm afraid She isn't gonna marry me But Laddie! That will spoil everything Things will spoil everything There,s nothing I can do about it is ready, I know where You do? Really I do Laddie Forever so long I've been saving up a great big powerful prayer What? A powerful prayer The kind when you talk to the Lord Like he was standing right in front of you and we have to get down to business and work at it You know, The way father prayed when mother was so sick last winter. I remember I almost said one like that it Easter when I wanted to find more eggs than Leon Well, I didn't have to And I almost said examination time I got you alright And so, I've saved it up I can say it now for you If you really want me to Laddie A powerful prayer... I'll do it right now But you really have to want what I'll ask for I really want it little sister All right Dear heavenly father... I come before you... this day... to ask you to keep Laddie,s heart from breaking... like mother's best picture... when the cream froze in it... On account of the way that princess is acting I know that you've made every man different, Lord... so that each woman could tell... which one belonged to her. But the princess don't... doesn't seem to know it. So if you'll just open her eyes to the truth that Laddie really and truly belongs to her... i,d be much obliged. Thanking you for this favour, I am ever thine Amen Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Lord... You've got the wrong man... Little sister! don't Is he the one? What on earth are you talking about? Him! - He doesn't belong to you? - But he does he's my brother - Your brother? - My brother Robert Pryor he's come all the way from England just to see me Robert! What do? I feel dizy You have fever It did on the boat coming on right off I got off the bed too soon Oh Robert! Little sister run and tell your family that my brother's ill All right Stanton,s farm is near upstear They,ll take care of you - John? - Yeah? John I think you'd better go for dr. Bond That poor lad's fever is getting worse - All right mother - Mrs Stanton? - Yes dear Mrs Stanton... Before you do anything more, I... I think that it's only fair that you should know something about Robert My dear, he's a sick boy That's all that concerns us Mrs Stanton... By my father's standards... My brother's past might almost be considered criminal He was dishonorably discharged from the army There,s that all things seem unimportant at a time like this Not to father He was a captain in the service Following tradition of the Pryors Then he a was a ninth promotion to major And Robert got into trouble The scandal prevented fathers advancement Then something inside of him seemed to snap He hasn't been the same man You'll forget all that as soon as he realizes that Robert is back Parents are a lot more talented than suspected You don't know father Ever since he resigned his post Well, the importance of the army, the disgrace... it got in his mind... Wait until you get him home You'll see everything will change No I don't dare take him home If father saw him he,d shoot Robert on sight Shoot his own son? You mean, he,d shoot him dead? Good Lord! Always underfoot run out and play! But I don't want to play Go on, come along That's a good girl M'dam I think i,d better ride to get over mother Betty think I can do it without father,s Of course my dear you run right along don't you worry about Robert Thank you Missed again Hello!

That might be a good idea I haven't had much luck by myself What kind of ammunitions do you use? I use lion,s tongue seeds on the Lions And tigers little seeds on the Tigers Aahh... very appropriate don't you ever bring down your prey? No, I don't like to shoot things dead And you?

Sally said that Mr. Pryor threatened to kill his own son I'm sorry mr. Pryor you disturbed the patient I've come to take my son home Mrs Stanton He hasn't any home I beg you pardon? He never did have one A home is a place filled with love and understanding Where one can find protection and shelter in times of trouble The house he lived in must have been just a monument of Pride And the door was shut in his face the moment that pride was in danger. I did what I thought was right. For yourself maybe, But not your son He was in trouble and you leEt him And he had to face all alone Well he isn't alone now thank heaven Of course we are just plain people, farmers, Mr Pryor, But Robert is welcome to stay with us as long as he likes Do you realize what my son did?
