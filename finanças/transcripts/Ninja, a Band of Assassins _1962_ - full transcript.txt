A Daiei Production The first year of the Tensho period (1573), summer: Oda Nobunaga, burning with ambition to dominate the entire nation, attacked the allied forces of Asakura Yoshikage and Asai Nagamasa in the north of Oomi.

Though Asakura Yoshikage managed to escape to Echizen... ...I have received word that he finally cut his belly at Ichijo Valley. Goemon, yet again your judgment was sound. You were wise to leave Yoshikage at Oomi. Yes, sir. In the 13 years since Oda Nobunaga took Lord Imagawa's head at Okehazama... ...he has become a cruel, ruthless and destructive tyrant. If he continues unhindered, he will no doubt conquer the entire nation. We have pledged to utilize Ninjutsu only in the service of those daimyo... ...who seek our services, and who are willing to reward us for them. It is sufficient that we employ our an as mercenaries. But I refuse to abide this Nobunaga, who seeks to conquer the entire country. It is just as our Master says! Nobunaga treats us Ninja with contempt. Such petty matters do not anger me at all. Several years ago, he sacrilegiously set fire to Mount Hiei. He reduced a thousand divine icons to ashes in one fell swoop... ...and cruelly murdered 1,600 clergymen; it was an unforgivable act of great evil. The art of Ninjutsu was created by En-no-ozunu the Ascetic during the reign of Emperor Tenchi. It was then spread by the Yamabushi monks of the Tendai and Shingon Mikkyo sects... ...in order to extend and protect the practice of Buddhism. The mudras and mantras of the Ninja are the legacy of Tendai and Shingon... ...they are aspects of the divine teachings of the Buddha... ...and thus, more than demons and devils, this Nobunaga is the arch-enemy of all Ninja. What will be Nobunaga's next move? What do you think? If anyone has an idea, speak up. He's moving from victory to victory. I think he'll invade Echu and attack Uesugi. Master. Yohachi. Go ahead. Sir... Before Uesugi, he'll attack Tokugawa Ieyasu of Mikawa. He is a thorn in Nobunaga's side. No, he'll do neither of those things. Uesugi is no longer a match for Nobunaga. Ieyasu is a deeply insightful strategist. Thus, he will not yet oppose Nobunaga, who currently has the momentum. So what's your idea? First, he'll go to the capital, where he will claim the title of Shogun. What?! Wait, Yohachi... I am thinking along the same lines as Goemon. Yes, sir. Last night, Fujibayashi Nagato gathered his men... ...and solemnly ordered them to assassinate Nobunaga. But we are the ones who must take Nobunaga's head. If by some chance the Ninjas of the Fujibayashi garrison should manage to kill him... ...then our preeminent position as custodians of the Iga Shiju-ku-ryu style... ...would be fatally undermined. Do bear this in mind, and do not forget it. That is all that I have to say. Endeavor, endeavor, perseverance is difficult... ...we must be ready to immediately sever even our love of parents and spouse. Thus the word “Shinobi” puts heart beneath the sword. Goemon. He has summoned you. The Master? From now on, I want you to act as my counselor. I hear that you are good with numbers; thus, for now, I want you to remain here. I want you to undertake an accounting of income and expenditures. Yes, sir. Hitherto I have had Ino-ne do all the bookkeeping. But the burden is too heavy for her alone, so I want for you to assist her. So, will you accept? It is an overwhelming honor, sir. He said that he couldn't afford to lose me in battle! He's making me a lieutenant! I'm finally getting my chance to move up the ranks. Goodbye to the endless menial days of plowing the field and Ninja-training! Dad, you'll see, I'll become a great Ninja someday, even greater than the Master. Dad. Dad? Aren't you happy for me? Do you earnestly believe what you just said? Of course. I'm Goemon, the best in our garrison when it comes to special skills. The only hurdle I've got left now is to compete with the Master! Goemon. What does a Ninja live for? Starting as an innocent toddler, he must endure hard training in Ninjutsu... ...then he's sent to serve under some warlord in the east, or some daimyo in the west... ...and does so knowing that his life is always at risk. “If he is captured, he must endure exquisite tortures, and yet not divulge the truth." “Rather than disclose his name, he will intently seek death instead." “When escape is no longer possible... “...he will burn his face with fire... "...and if fire be not at hand, he will disfigure his face with his sword... “...and thus no one will ever know his true identity." “He is born in darkness, and he will die in darkness." “This is the path of the Ninja's life, it is the path of death." I've memorized it well, haven't I? Goemon. Human happiness and pride are not for the Ninja, don't you know that? Nonsense! A Ninja can bring down an invincible fortress, all by himself. He can defeat great armies of thousands and tens of thousands. Seems like you're too far gone. I've lost you somewhere along the way. Oh, just wait and see. I'll become the next Master. There are times when I'm mixing gunpowder, all alone at the mountain hut... ...that I become unbearably frightened. That's silly. That hut is well guarded, no one can get near it. Dad, you're being paranoid. Perhaps so. I just want to teach you these formulas for our gunpowder... ...then leave for somewhere quiet, and end my days in peace. Good night. Hey. Does the Master ever sleep with his wife? She always sleeps alone. You've got to be kidding. You're new here so you wouldn't know, but since his wife arrived... ...they haven't so much as held hands. No way. If you think I'm lying, ask anyone. Everybody knows about it. What's wrong with the Master? Who's there?! It's Kizaru... Open up! Right. Please let me speak to the Lord. He has not returned yet. I have information for him, please call him. He will be here directly. If you please... Please wait a moment. Please... An old man disguised as a farmer, you say? Yes. Only Ishikawa Goemon or Momochi Sandayu are capable of such sophisticated disguises. Momochi? Why would anyone from Momochi's group be skulking around here? How would I know? Kizaru... I've heard that you saw Goemon. Yes. What was your impression? I'm sorry...? How would you assess his skills? I would say he's adequate. Adequate, eh? You're just a sore loser. In my opinion, Goemon is a rare, great talent. Indeed, it's possible that he might eventually surpass Sandayu himself. I even wish I could induce him to work for me. Oh, I've been waiting for this! If he's making you jealous, hone your skills and try to become Goemon's equal. If I may be so bold, it's rumored that Goemon plays fast and loose with women. If that's true, then he's not fit to be called a Ninja. Well, I've got the same problem! Right, Hinona? Now forget about that old farmer, and have a drink! Give him a cup! Please. In that case... Going already? Stay a while and relax. Don't stop him, Hinona. He's doing us a favor. Right, Kizaru? I've finally chased Kizaru away. He brought you information, but it's as if you wanted to chase him away. Not as if, I did chase him away! Oh gee. It's all your fault. My fault? I couldn't wait to be alone with you. Lord, you shouldn't jest. This is no jest. I'm going to show you a thoroughly good time tonight. Please... Tamo, are you ready to go? Yes. Let me say once again... ...that you are Kunoichi, that you are a woman, and not a Ninja. Your role is as an assistant to Ninjas... ...and you must obey every order of your commander. Understand? Yes. This is your commander, Magodayu. You will obey Magodayu's commands after you arrive at Nagashima. Yes. A samurai's most prized virtue is the ability to indulge in shame. A Ninja, on the other hand, in order to complete a mission... ...must be crafty, deceptive, dishonest... ...and commit whatever vile deeds are necessary. A Kunoichi must abandon all feminine pride... never forget this! Sir! Nagashima is the headquarters of the Ikko-sect rebels. Nobunaga will undoubtedly attack it. Speaking of which, several warlords arrived yesterday at Inabayama Castle in Gifu. This is a matter of utmost concern. They're getting ready. The Ikko will be exterminated in a surprise attack. As Nobunaga appears to be about to attack, I shot some warning message arrows... ...into Nagashima's Seigan-ji Temple. Well done. Yes, sir. Tamo. Come receive the cup of farewell. Yes, sir. Attack! Halt! Goemon... Excellent, as always. I don't have time to fool around. Know where the Master is? I don't know. Strange. He's nowhere in the garrison. What was that noise? I don't know. Dad! What happened here? I have no idea, there was a huge explosion, and I couldn't see anything in the smoke. Is that a woman? Yes, sir. Brave of her to attack me, Nobunaga. Tell me your name! I will spare you for your bravado. Now speak! Speak! Bury her... ...up to her neck. She must suffer as long as possible before she dies. Got that? The bloodthirsty heretic. I, Nagata, will one day show him the horror of defying the Buddha. What if Momochi beats us to it while you're sitting on your asses? He forced the Imperial Court to make him Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. Nobunaga's arrogance indeed knows no bounds. If we don't snuff him out now, the future of the Ninja will be in jeopardy. Go to Gifu at once. Kudobei's poisons and Yohachi's shuriken are the pride of the Momochi garrison. The silent and the moving. Do whatever it takes to eliminate Nobunaga. Yes, sir! You're working hard. Has the Master returned yet? I heard he was going to be late. Goemon... What... what is your opinion of me? What do you mean? You must know how it is between Sandayu and I. Don't deny it. He hasn't so much as touched me since our wedding. What kind of wife am I? Do you pity me, as a woman who has given up on life? Or perhaps you think of me as a lifeless doll? Not so... I, Ino-ne, am neither of those things. Sandayu has treated me coldly. I've been waiting for the day I'll be able to pay him back. Blood is boiling in my body; I burn with passion, like this! Goemon! When you came to the garrison... ...I vowed to be reborn as a passionate woman, a woman who lives for you. Goemon, I'm begging you! I'm begging you! Ino-ne...! I'm so happy, Goemon! Tighter! Ino-ne. Hold me much tighter! Let's go... Doh... Ah... now this is a fine daikon radish. Farmer, where are you from? Well, sir, um... Well?! Yes, sir. Answer me! Move! Well...? Yummy...? Now... Lord, your cat. Get him! This way! Charge! Fools! Out of the way! Dammit! Oh Goemon, you've come... did anyone see you? Don't worry. I made sure everyone was asleep. You're being silly. But... aren't you getting tired of me? Would I be sneaking in to see you if I was? I'm so happy... I'm so jealous! It's obvious from his clothes and tools that he's a Ninja. Lord, he must've been hired, perhaps by Uesugi, to take your life. Talk! Who sent you! Talk, you bastard! Talk or you'll be tortured to death! Do it. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Hold it. He's a Ninja. Mere torture won't make him talk. Yes, sir. Let's see, now... ...since his insolent ears won't hear us anyway, he doesn't need them. Cut them off! Yes, sir. Well...? Can't you hear me either? Bastard! How's that? Has your hearing improved? Seems like he's still having a problem hearing us. Nobu'osu. Cut off the other one! Yes, sir. You think it over for a while... But you won't last too long. “A Ninja must endure any kind of torture, and even at the cost of his life... “...he must not speak a word about his identity or mission." Oh! Hey! Get him! Don't lose him! Don't lose him! There he is! So Yohachi's dead. They say he disfigured his face, just as a true Ninja should. Nobunaga must be in a panic. His castle security is extremely tight, inside and out. What happened to Kudobei? He's crafted a rumor that Nobunaga's attacker wasn't a Ninja, but a survivor of Asakura. He's spreading it around the Gifu castle area. Quite cunning. He's a couple notches above you, I'd say. That's nothing... You'll see, I'll be the man who kills Nobunaga. Well said! That's what I expect from Kizaru of the Fujibayashi garrison! Good job. Hinona, there's something I need to check... take the saké away. Yes. I feel like Sandayu is watching us from somewhere. Sandayu's eyes are upon us. Ahh! Over there! Where? There. From behind the wall. He's glaring at us! My Lord... my Lord... please forgive me. There's nobody there! Calm down. Our Lord, our Lord is there for sure! That's ridiculous. The Master has gone to Ryuguchi, remember? But that mouse... Mouse? He knows the an of using mice, you know. Sandayu knows about us. I'm scared! He's going to kill me! So you'd just let him cruelly murder you? If you don't want to die, you have to pull yourself together! You can still get out of this. He hasn't caught you in the act. If I were to disappear, you'd be fine. Where will you go? But you're the most skilled man in the whole garrison. You're going to leave me, and go to serve another Master? Don't be ridiculous. Anyway, if I leave the garrison... ...the Master will certainly forgive you. I don't like it. Sandayu already knows, so I'm doomed. If you're leaving the garrison, then I'm going with you. Let go, you dog! How dare you sleep with the Master's wife? When the Master gets back I'm telling him everything. Just you wait and see! What are you doing? I have to kill Hata. Goemon! If I kill Hata, no one will know! It's pointless. We can't fool Sandayu! Let's leave the garrison at once. Take me with you! Let go! Let's run away together! Let go! Ino-ne! Ino-ne! Master! And where are you going? Running away to the Fujibayashi garrison? Running away? Now why would I be running away? Shut up. Do you really think you can conceal anything from Sandayu? If you still insist that you don't know what I'm talking about... ...then we'll just have to go and talk to Hata. Do you still deny it? Please forgive me. That cannot be. I'm going to kill you. So, it appears that you're not ready to die. Yes... Well then... I'll let you live. But in return, you must kill Nobunaga. Can you kill him? Yes. He's not going to be an easy target. I'll kill him. I assure you, I'll kill him. If you blunder, you're dead. You think you can do it? No matter what it takes! Nobunaga will be going to the capital soon. So you too must be on your way at once. Yes. Don't rush things. But don't go too slowly, either. Make your plans with care, and strike perfectly. Yes. But even if you're successful, it won't be atonement for your great sin. Thus, while waiting for your chance, you will become a burglar. A burglar? Steal money only. If you fail, there's a possibility that Nobunaga will attack us. Either way, we will require a fortune to support our military expenses. I'll let you have a tenth of the stolen money... ...but the rest will go to the agent who will accompany you. Understood? But it is strictly forbidden for a Ninja to steal. Silence! Did you not steal my wife from me? Not only that, you got her killed, and tried to run away. I, Nagata, bear witness... ...that if there's any man in the Momochi garrison that can kill Nobunaga... ...then Ishikawa Goemon is that man! If Goemon kills Nobunaga, our Fujibayashi garrison will forever be beneath Momochi! The Ninjutsu lineage of Fujibayashi has endured since the ancient Heian era! We can't let upstarts like the Momochi rise above us! So our garrison will immediately deploy our most skilled men to the capital! No matter what it takes, kill Nobunaga before Goemon does! If Goemon beats you to it, then consider yourselves dead! The Capital (Kyoto) My Lord... ...may I have another? I heard that Imperial official got his entire stash of money stolen last night. Serves him right. The rich can't even afford a good night's sleep! Pretty impressive burglar, I must say. Rumor has it that it was a Ninja. Who cares, it's none of our business anyway! If Ninjas are thought to be thieves, then our reputation will be besmirched. Thus we must ensure that the thief isn't a Ninja... ...even though he is a Ninja. “Not a Ninja, though he is a Ninja?“ Don't you understand? The thief's name is Ishikawa Goemon. He was once a low-ranking Ninja under Momochi Sandayu... ...who slept with Sandayu's wife. When he got caught, he tossed the woman into a well and fled. It must become publicly known that he was excommunicated from the Ninja. You don't have to reveal my name. Is there any other way? Must the Master go this far? You've got no one to blame but yourself. I'll be spreading the rumor. All you have to do is obey the Master. The money... You'll see, in two or three days, Ishikawa Goemon will be the talk of the town. Ishikawa Goemon Wanted: Ishikawa Goemon "Reward for the arrest of Public Villain Ishikawa Goemon: for information about his where-abouts, 50 pieces of silver. For his capture, 200 pieces of silver." Ishikawa Goemon is now attacking women. That Goemon's always been lecherous. He took advantage of his Master's wife... ...dumped her in a well and took off; he's that kind of villain! He posts his name when he robs a place... what kind of guy is he? He's got a bushy beard, and so ugly just seeing him sends chills up your spine! Not to mention, he's about 7-shaku tall, a giant the size of a demon! That's not right, I heard he's around 5-shaku tall! No way! They say he effortlessly leapt over an 8-shaku wall. Come on, let's get going. - Yeah... - Okay... The Master urgently inquires as to why you stopped burgling after Nobunaga arrived. I've been investigating him. Liar. The Master knows everything. Nobunaga's going back to Gifu tomorrow. Villain! Are you Goemon?! You couldn't kill him. Why did you interfere? There they are, get them! Here they come; now what'll you do? I'll settle the score with you later. He's getting away! He's gone to the other side! Sakai Come on, come have a good time. We'll treat you right! Get in, hurry up! Come on in! What a handsome man! Shut up! Ooh, he's scary... Hey, do you want to play? Eat. I'm telling you to eat. Thank you. I've had no customers... so I couldn't eat. Don't explain, just eat. Y... yes. What province are you from? Kawachi. Got parents? I just had my grandpa, but he died. And you, customer? Mind your own business. Thank you. Customer, are you a traveler? Enough with the "customer". But I don't know your name. My name is Maki. I'm Goemon. Sure... you're Ishikawa Goemon! And what if I was Ishikawa Goemon? Yeah, sure you are... Ishikawa Goemon has a scruffy beard. And he has a horrible face, like a demon. Even I know that. But you... Well, I wouldn't care if you were the real Goemon. What's so funny? When we first met, I was really scared of you. Are you angry? I'm fed up. Of me? No, never you. I don't ever want us to be apart. You're a good person. You look beautiful. Really? I won't ever let you go. I'm so happy! Oh yeah, I heard that Ishikawa Goemon got caught. They caught him? Aren't you glad? Yeah, I'm glad. Last night a customer from the capital said he watched him get executed. He said that he was laughing when they crucified him... ...and even when they disemboweled him, he laughed like it was nothing. Talk about bravery! He wasn't being brave... Just thinking about being crucified drove him insane. Liar! Ishikawa Goemon wasn't a coward. If Goemon could hear what you're saying, he'd be pleased. I don't want to talk about Goemon any more. What is it? Hey? What a creep! You said it. Die! They said the sword went in his belly and out his back. What a cruel way to kill... Stop it. What is it? What are you mad about? Just shut up! “What does a Ninja live for?" “Lately I've come to realize, down to my very bones, that the Ninja's life is meaningless.” Maki... Will you be my wife? Let's go somewhere quiet, where we can live in peace. Where no one will bother us, and it'll just be you and me. Here's your redemption money, go buy your freedom. If this isn't enough, I've got all the money it takes. Let's get out of here, right away. You've neglected two missions, and spilled Ninja blood. What's the matter with you? Say what you will. I'm fed up with stealing money and attacking Nobunaga. Fool. Infatuated by a woman... ...you are depraved in body and mind. Did you think the Master didn't know what you've been up to? “Know this: the punishment for disobedience is instant death." You can't just linger about; Nobunaga is coming here to Sakai tomorrow. To Sakai? He's supposed to be coming to inspect the port, but that's just a ruse. Two or three days ago Kiraya Zaeomon got a shipment of... ...newfangled Portuguese muskets, and he's coming to buy them. He will definitely meet with Kiraya Zaeomon. You couldn't ask for a better chance; that's all I've got to say. Goemon. This way! Go around! As expected, the Portuguese-made ones have far better craftsmanship. Hey... Sir? It was worth coming to Sakai, wasn't it? Indeed, sir. Zaeomon. Yes, sir. I'll buy all the muskets you can supply. With armor and helmets getting stronger than ever, guns are the future of warfare. It is indeed as you say. Even so, are there any fools left who dare to confront your awesome might, my Lord? Indeed there are. Madmen, who are more obstinate than foolish. Madmen? Don't you know? It's those Ikko rebels. We thought that we had crushed them at Nagashima... ...but now they've dug themselves in at Ishiyama's Hongan-ji Temple. They believe that if they die in battle, they'll go to paradise; that makes them tough. There are others... groups that are even tougher. Like the Ninjas of Iga. Villain! Turn out! Zaeomon, look after our Lord. Yes, sir. Turn out! Intruders! Turn out! Intruders! - Intruders! - Intruders! - Ouch! Ouch! - Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Fools, why are you hanging back? Hurry up and catch him! Now! What are you doing?! Get him! Catch him! Catch him now! Move! Hey, come play with me. The authorities are out in force; they've chased away all the customers. Hey! Is it... Hata? Wow! Goemon, it's you! When did you come to Sakai? About a month ago. You've become so famous. You're the talk of the town. But I knew you'd never get caught. Why did you become a prostitute? It all started because of you. Me? It was midnight, ten days after you ran away. I saw a blow-dart stuck in madam's pale white neck. A blow-dart? Her face has haunted me ever since. I couldn't sleep any more; I got so scared that I ran away from the garrison. She'd been struck by a dart? Of course! You should know, you shot her! No, it wasn't me. Then, the Master...? How did you know about me and Ino-ne? A mouse. A mouse? That's right. A mouse scuttled over my feet, and woke me up. I went to the toilet, and on the way I heard madam's voice. I took a peek. I was so incredibly jealous! I was in love with you back then. What's the matter? What's the scary look for? It was all a ploy by the Master. He put me together with Ino-ne, knowing what would happen, and then killed her. He ensured you would witness it, so now he's got me trapped, every which way! Wow... Is the Master that big of a bastard? Come to think of it, maybe he killed your father too. What? That morning, Murota and I went to gather firewood. From the mountain ridge, we saw... ...the Master go into the hut. You're sure you saw that?! Yes. The hut blew up... ...shortly thereafter. Now that I recall, when I was running to the hut... ...Sandayu came dashing up out of nowhere. So he probably did it. My dad made gunpowder for many years, and never had an accident. He's in that storage hut? Yes, sir, we're sure of it. With a woman. You'd better get out of here. Leave this to me! Hurry! Hurry! Hold it! What do you want? I'm just a prostitute. Surround the hut! I didn't do anything! Let me go! Let me go! What did you come here for? What is this?! A scroll containing your father's secret formulas. What's it doing here?! He gave it to me before he died. That's a lie! My father was blown to bits... ...but this is intact; it's proof that you killed my father! Bastard. You did it to get his gunpowder secrets. Silence. Have you forgotten your great debt to me, and how I showed you mercy? Shut up! You can't fool me anymore. Not only did you kill my father, you killed Ino-ne as well. Have you gone insane? First, you lose your head over a woman... ...and now you cook this up to justify breaking your oath? Not so. Listen... I'll make myself clear. As of today... ...I am no longer a Ninja! We are complete strangers now. And you can have this! Say what you will, but as long as you live, you cannot escape me. Mustard powder... you know what happens when you breathe it. I don't want to kill you. You'd better leave quickly. 8th month of the 8th year of the Tensho period (1580): Nobunaga obtained an imperial edict, then attacked and burned Hongan-ji Temple of Ishiyama, the last stronghold of the Ikko-sect rebels, killing everyone inside, men and women, young and old alike. He's finally going to come here. Master, who do you speak of? Nobunaga. Luck is on his side. First it was Mount Hiei, then Nagashima, and now Ishiyama. He does not fear the punishment of the Buddhas... ...he's as cruel as a man can be, and everything is going his way. We Ninjas of Iga are the only ones left who might thwart him. Will Nobunaga attack Iga? He will... as soon as he's confident that he can take us. Then, it's war. We must kill Nobunaga before he attacks. There is no other way to protect Iga. But who can kill Nobunaga? Magodayu. Yes, sir. Return and do as you've been doing; don't let Nobunaga out of your sight. Yes, sir. They're done roasting. Eat it while it's hot. It's good. Yes. What's the matter? Why aren't you eating? What's the matter? Not feeling well? I'm sorry... The roasting smell got to me. That's weird. You always enjoy it. Well... I... am going to have a baby. What...? Really?! Wow! You're having my baby. It should be better now. Come back inside. Yes. I'll go get you some mountain grapes, I saw a bunch of them nearby. They're juicy, so they'll be refreshing. But it's so late. It's nothing. I can get around this mountain blindfolded. I'll go with you. No, the night wind is hard on the body. Wait inside, I'll be right back. Okay? Who's there?! Sandayu! Show yourself! You will address me as "Master". I told you that you'll never be able to escape me. I will be free of you. You'll see! Do you think a low-ranking novice Ninja could even touch the mighty Sandayu? One whistle from me and Maki's dead. Yozo is at your hut. Maki will live or die, depending on what you say. That swine Nobunaga has spent a fortune on the construction of Azuchi Castle... ...as a demonstration to the nation of his power. When Nobunaga takes up residence at his new castle, there will be days of festivities. If you take advantage of the pandemonium, you will surely get your chance. Make haste to Azuchi. The faster you arrive, the more chances you will get. If I succeed in assassinating Nobunaga, will you give me my freedom? First you must succeed, then we shall see. This is a deadly poison called "tranquil cessation". One drop will induce a very quick death. Fool! You will leave immediately, from right here! Here is your Shinobi outfit and tools. Do not return until you have killed Nobunaga. In the meantime, I shall take good care of Maki. Maki is having my child. Go! I told you to go! No, I don't care if he's a Ninja or not. He's the only man for me! In all the world, only him! Then a word of warning. Ninja are never permitted to truly love a woman. It's a strict code. Best you keep that in mind. And you mustn't leave this hut at all. My eyes will always be upon you. Forget these words at your peril. Will he come home safely? That depends on whether he obeys the commands of the Master. If he succeeds, it'll be life. If he fails, he'll find death. Come on, run faster! Go right, turn left at that corner; left, left, left, tum left there! There, that's the Yamato river. Come on, why are you so slow? Follow the riverbank! Hey, "Monkey"... Yes, sir. Come here, it's a perfect view. Yes, sir. Indeed, my Lord, like the view, your enlightened power is now perfect. Not quite... Yes? Consider... the Ninjas of Iga. Father, let's just crush them now. What are you talking about? Have you forgotten the thrashing you got when you impetuously attacked them? They're Ninjas, far trickier than the Ikko rebels. By the way, Monkey, is everything ready for the castle-completion celebration? Yes, sir, everything's on schedule. Generals Tanba Nagahide and Tsutsui Junkei have already arrived. My Lord! Call a doctor! Call a doctor! Call a doctor! Get Sir Kinoshita, hurry! Lord! Lord! Hurry! Who is it? It's the ghosts of the Ikko rebels! What are you doing to me?! Get out of my way! My Lord, please calm yourself! Rin Pyo To Sha Kai Jin Retsu Zai... Zen! Adversary Oda Nobunaga, immediately perish! What's wrong with him? I am sorry, but this defies diagnosis. What are we going to do if he doesn't regain his senses? It's almost time. Could it be the curse of the Ikko rebels? Or maybe this is the work of a Ninja. A Ninja? You still don't know what's wrong? “The willow teeters in the wind..." “Why do our hearts become wistful?” “Indeed, the Iris is poetic of old." Damn it! My Lord, are you feeling better? I'm fine. Until I unite the nation under my dominion... ...I won't die, not even if they beat me to death! I am ever in awe of your amazing good fortune. Monkey, will we reach Otogi Pass by dawn? Yes, sir, undoubtedly. I'm sure no one at the castle knows we're gone. They're probably too swept up in the celebrations to notice. We're under attack! Nobunaga's launched a surprise attack! Nobunaga? We've failed! Hinona! Hinona! Fool! My Lord, this is the end! Don't kill yourself! Lord, let me die! Let me die! There's still a way out! This way! Fire! Don't let them get through! Don't let even one get through! Sandayu! Show yourself! Sandayu. One Master ruling two garrisons... ...pitting them against each other to accomplish one aim. This is the ultimate expression of the essence of Ninjutsu. Maki! The End
