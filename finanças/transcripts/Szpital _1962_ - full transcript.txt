And that tomorrow you can go home. We'll pick you up in the afternoon. You'll see that you'll be fine at home. I prepared your room. You'll see how it will be clean, warm and nice.

Where is it now? Dammit. I had it here... Aah! There you are, brother! Take it! Take it! Take it! This is all I've got. Better save it. It's really hard to get ammunition. Goodbye forever It's just what you want Why these tears of departure? Will you play with that train of yours? If not, I'll burn it. No, no... How come? What are you saying, my dear? It's not his train. No, no, no! You're no longer Lisette! No, no, no! Forget that name! That's true. I am leaving forever This is the end, you know Goodbye forever It's just what you want Why these tears of departure? Give me your hand and go away Off we go! When it has to be like that I sing for you every night those few banal words Always the same refrain I'll sing it again today But it will sound different Because from today my heart knows... Listen, my dear. Stop it. You see how sad he is and you have to bring up memories. You know what? We have to cheer him up. - Let's dance. - Get lost, I'll break my legs. Very well, very well... Hop! Hop! Chin up! Chin up! Enjoy life! Hey, why are you so rude? Come out. I brought you something nice, come out! Give it to me! Renia! Renia! Come here. Come to grandma. We're leaving. I'm coming, grandma! Just a minute! Are you coming to grandma or not, you rotten little brat? I'll break your bones, goddammit. Coming, grandpa! Goodbye! Did you call me? No, no. My love...
