[Charles] The winter of '’96 was a strange one. My family was used to nature'’s cold hand around Christmas. We learned to survive her frozen fury. But that year, nature laid a warm cheek on Walnut Grove. The snow began to melt in the high country even before its white blanket touched the flat land. Steam rose from the rivers as the sun warmed the flowing waters. It would be an easy Christmas for my daughter and her family... or so she thought. Oh! Watch where you'’re going, clumsy oaf! I'’m sorry! [groans] Shouldn'’t give you anymore trouble. I appreciate it. You know, that'’s a long trip. Smart of you to check everything out before you start. Well, especially with Rose and Laura along. I wouldn'’t want anything to spoil their trip. Mr. Wilder! Mr. Wilder! Whoa-ho! Whoa. Slow down there, partner. I thought you might have left already. You remember what we discussed? For your mother. It'’s supposed to be a surprise. Don'’t worry about a thing. You'’ll be back in time for Christmas? Long before. You can do me a favor. Run over the mill and tell Mr. Edwards I'’m waitin' on him. Will you do that? Be glad to. And thanks. That reminds me. Sarah'’d have my hide if I didn'’t give you her list. Looks like we'’re all gonna be beholden to you for Christmas. -The money'’s in there, too. -Glad to oblige. -Safe trip. -We'’ll do that. Edwards! If you'’re waitin' for me, you'’re backin' up. [chuckles] All right, Carter, you behave yourself while we'’re gone, or Santa won'’t come. [laughs] [Edwards] All right. Let'’s go. Ah, Montague. I'’d have known you'’d show up soon as everything was loaded. My labors are intellectual, not physical. Oh, still turnin'’ them German words into English, are you? And to the best of my ability. Which is why I mustn'’t linger here any longer than necessary. I merely came out to wish you a safe and pleasant journey and a speedy return. Well, thank you, Mr. Montague. Now, you'’re sure you can manage until we get back? Oh, quite sure. We'’re not children, Aunt Laura. All right. Now, you two take care of each other. Next time you think about it, we'’re gonna be right back here loaded down with Christmas cheer. Mm, in the form of baubles and trinkets, no doubt. Oh, now, Montague, don'’t tell me you'’ve got somethin' against Christmas. Not Christmas, Edwards. Grass commerciality and sentimentalism masquerading as Christian love. Emphasis on gift-giving is compromising our souls. Well, I'’ll tell you something, old buddy. I never wanna compromise your soul, so I'’ll just skip over buying you a present this year. Mm, suits me fine. -Edwards, let'’s get a move on. -Oh, all right. -Don'’t take no wooden nickels. -Oh, I won'’t, Mr. Edwards. [chuckles] Ha! Hyah! Bye. Have a good time! [groaning] [sighs] Patrick. Patrick? Patrick? Your husband is not here, Elsa. Huh? Patrick'’s not here? Oh... Oh, he'’s waiting for us in Milford. Oh... I... Oh, why do I feel so funny? We had to give you something for the pain. It was a very difficult delivery. The baby. The baby. I wanna hold my baby. -Elsa... -Oh. Is it a boy or a girl? I know Patrick wants a boy, but I hope it'’s a girl. It doesn'’t matter. We waited so long. Oh, please, doctor, bring me the baby. I wanna hold it. Elsa, your little boy... A boy? I have a boy. Where-- where is he? [chuckles] What have you done with him? I-- I did everything I could... [Elsa] No! No! No! -No, no. I want my... -Doctor? -I want my son! -Nurse, hold her down. -Hold her down. -You'’re lying... You'’re lying to me. Bring me my son. We have to go to Milford. [sobbing] I have to bring Patrick his son. Here, Rosy. -Here you go. -Come here. All right. I'’ll see you inside. Okay. I'’ll get this f-- freight unloaded while you check us in. Well, don'’t go spending all our profit at the Red Dog Saloon. Almanzo, what do you say a thing like that for? You know I ain'’t touched no whiskey in years. That hasn'’t stopped you from spending all your spare time at the Red Dog buying drinks for your old friends. You act like generosity is a crime. When your generosity involves my money, it is a crime. -Dagnabit, Wilder. -Just meet us back here in front of the hotel in half an hour. -Half an hour? -Plenty of time to get the shipment unloaded. Well, I know that! Socializing is a very important thing. Twenty-nine minutes. I'’m going, I'm going. Hyah! Hyah! Come on. Hyah! Here we are. Two drops of this in your tea at bedtime will put you in top shape in no time. Elsa, you'’ve got to get your strength up so that you can join Patrick. I know he'’s anxious to have you with him. I don'’t want to see Patrick. When I see him, I have to tell him about the baby. And that'’s all he's talked about for months. That'’s why he insisted on going back to Milford ahead of us so that he could make everything perfect when I brought the baby to our new home. Elsa. Elsa, I know how you feel, but you can'’t live in the past. What'’s happened is over, and there'’s nothing you can do to change it. Now you have to live for the future. There is no future, doctor. I can'’t have another child. Elsa, you don'’t mean that. [sniffles] You say you know how I feel. If you really did, you'’d know that I mean that. Goodbye, doctor. Elsa... If there'’s anything I can do for you, anything to help... Thank you, doctor. But there'’s nothing. I told him half hour. That was almost an hour ago. -Well, maybe he got held up. -Mm-hmm. Third bar stool from the left. -Almanzo. -Let'’s go. Where are we going? Well, we can stand around and let moss grow under our feet, or we can do our Christmas shopping. Let'’s go. Well, wait for us! Come on. Come on. Oh! Come on, Rosy. [no audible dialogue] [sighs] I just can'’t find the perfect gift for Mr. Edwards. Well, I'’m tellin' you, we'’re not buying him anything until we know if he spent all our money at the Red Dog Saloon. -Almanzo Wilder! -Heh-heh! -Baby. -Oh... Go see the baby. Look at the baby! Look! Look! Ah. Manly? What? [Laura] Stay there, sweetheart. Do you think you can keep her distracted while I go in? Ah, go ahead. She won'’t even notice you'’re gone. -Thanks. -Okay. [Almanzo] Rosy, Rosy, look at my package here. Look at that. Christmas is coming. Right here. Rosy, have you been a good girl this year? -[Rose] Oh, yeah. -[Almanzo] I think you have. I think you'’ve been a very good girl this year. -[Rose] Baby. -[Almanzo] You want the baby? Rosy, now I want you to stand right here and watch the baby while daddy goes and gets some apples for mommy and daddy and Rosy, okay? Good. All right. I'’ll be right back. You stay right there. Okay. [clamoring] -Come on, everybody! Fight! -Oh, no. Keep the change, will ya? Now for you two. [screaming] [man 1] Come on, come on.. [men laughing] -I could'’ve handled it. -I can see that. Well, I could have. You see, I was just wearing '’em down. Manly, Mr. Edwards, are you all right? Oh, yeah. We'’re-- We're just gettin'’ a little exercise. [sighs] Honesty, you two! I leave you alone for one minute and... -Where'’s Rose? -She'’s right over there... What? Rose! -All right. -Manly, where is she? I left her right here. Right here. Rose! All right, let'’s split up. We'’re gonna find her, Beth. She cannot have gone too far. We'’re gonna find her. Wish I could offer you more hope. Lots of children disappearing these days. Like they vanished into thin air. [Almanzo] There must be something you can do. [Sheriff] Well, happy to go along with you, ask folks if they'’ve seen her. That picture you brung might help. Might as well start where you last saw her. -Toy store just up the street. -Let'’s go. Hey, Beth, it might be good if you went back to the hotel. She might turn up there. No, she'’d never find her way back there. -I'’m going with you. -All right. [laughing] [laughing] [growls] There you are, Mrs. Norris. Thank you. I wonder, I'’ll be traveling with a child, a little girl. [man 2] Will she be needing a seat? Oh, no, I'’ll hold her on my lap. Then there'’ll be no extra charge for her. Thank you. Thank you very much. Do you want one? Coin, coin. Come along, baby. You know you'’re not supposed to talk to strangers. Well, thank you, ma'’am. Somebody should'’ve seen something, somewhere! Maybe there'’s a better way of going about this. Divide up, cover more territory. That'’s a good idea. -Where'’s your rig? -At the livery. There is an orphanage over on the other side, the north side of town. Seems like a lot of lost kids show up there. Okay. We'’ll ride over and check it out. I'’ll continue combing this area and see what I can stir up. I'’ll stay with you. She knows me. [Sheriff] Fine. We'’ll find her. Now, don'’t worry. Come on, Beth. [chair creaking] You here to adopt a boy? No, we'’re looking for a little girl. I knew it. Everybody wants to adopt a girl. We'’re not looking to adopt one. We'’re looking for our daughter. She'’s missing, and we thought maybe she came here. Nobody'’d come here unless they had to. Say, you got any boys around your house? -No. -Ought to consider it. A lot of things a boy can do around the house to be helpful. Take me, for instance. I can chop wood, feed the livestock, almost anything. I bet you'’d be surprised. I don'’t eat hardly anything at all. -I'’m sorry, but-- -Just biscuits for breakfast. I can skip supper. Samuel. Yes, Mr. Dodsworthy? Rule nine. "Do not speak unless spoken to." Correct. You should be in class, I believe. Yes, sir. I ain'’t afraid of hard work. Samuel... Well, I think we might have some good news for you. A little girl was dropped off not more than five minutes ago. Rose. Well, she'’s a shy child. Won'’t tell us her name, but, uh, she matches the description of your little girl. Where is she? Right this way. We'’ve bathed her, changed her clothes and combed her hair. [girl mumbling] [girl mumbling] Rose? Ah, you got a penny? Uh, anything you can give, ma'’am? Uh... Ah, you got a coin there, sir? Oh, you got, uh... [coins clattering] Well, hello there. [chuckles] Come along, darling. We don'’t wanna miss our train. [no audible dialogue] [train horn blaring] [bell tolling] [train chugging] Edwards. -Any luck? -No. We were hoping... We'’ve been in every store in this side of town. It'’s a way to the train station, but it might be worth a try. You know how young'’uns are when they see a train. [Edwards] She wouldn'’t have walked that far, you think? Where else we gonna look? Let'’s go. [train horn blaring] [no audible dialogue] Excuse me. Can you help us? If it'’s about a train, there ain'’t no hurry. Last one of the day pulled out half an hour ago. This is not about a train. It'’s about our daughter. -She'’s disappeared. -Disappeared? Here'’s a picture of her. No, I haven'’t seen her. Don'’t recall any young'uns wandering about here today. Of course I'’ve been behind the counter mostly. -You'’re sure? -Yeah. I'’ll keep an eye out for her though, in case she turns up. -Thanks. -Thanks. Say, uh, I hear you say you'’re looking for a little kid. Our daughter. Yeah, well, can I see that there picture? Yeah, yeah, I seen her, all right. [sighs] Thank God. When? Well, first time was, uh, was right here couple of hours ago, um... You say, uh, she'’s yourdaughter? -Yeah. -Yeah, funny. She was with this other woman, uh, acted like her mom. -What are you talkin'’ about? -Well, this here woman. I mean, she told the little girl to not to talk to strangers. Oh, my God. She'’s not lost, she'’s taken. Laura. Do you know where they went? Well, they, uh, they took the last train out to-- I remember her now. I didn'’t see the kid, but she asked if she needed a ticket for her. -Well, any description? -Oh. Just a woman, late 20s, early 30s, I'’d say. Uh, about so tall, uh, hair kind of reddish, I think. Do you know where the train was headed? Bound for points south, all the way to the border. It'’s a one-fare ride. She could get off anywhere between here and Mexico. We'’re never gonna find her. Lots of folks get off at the first stop. Sublimity. Quite a settlement there. -Take you half a day by wagon. -Thanks. -Thank you. -Hey, uh... Hey, you don'’t have to pay me for helping you out. I was just doing my duty as a citizen. [chuckles] Yeah, but thanks a lot! [crickets chirping] "How far we will have to go or how long we will be gone, we have no way of knowing." "We only know we won'’t be home until we find her. Laura." I can'’t believe it. Who would do something like that? Some poor, disturbed creature. You mean they aren'’t coming home in time for Christmas? I don'’t know. If there'’s anything we can do for you, Jenny... Thank you. We'’re managing quite well. Still, we thought you should know the news. Poor Rose. Oh, I hope she'’s all right. '’Manzo? Why did I leave her? If I'’d only stayed with her. -It wasn'’t your fault. -Yes, it... Can'’t you see that? No, I can'’t. Listen to me. It happened... and it wasn'’t anybody'’s fault. We are going to find her. Look at me. [sniffles] We are going to find her. Would you like something? Would you like somethin'’ to eat, ma'am? No, not right now, thanks. Ah, that'’s a pretty little girl you have. Thank you. She'’s been so good on the trip. [mumbles] Well, I'’ll be back through in an hour or so. -Bye-bye. -[Elsa] All right. [mumbles] My pretty little girl. [laughing] Come on! [chattering] Ho-ho-ho. I'’ll stay with the horses. -Here we go. -Get on. Come on. [boy sneezing] Gesundheit! [sneezing] [sneezing] All right, come on out of there or I'’ll come in after you! What the... Oh, I got your wire, all right. I even went over to the train station myself. But your little girl didn'’t get off here in Sublimity. But did you check the train? Mr. Wilder, I'’m all the law there is in Sublimity. One man. Now, if I was to have got on the train, I couldn'’t have been sure they didn'’t get off. Now, as things are, I can promise you one thing, nobody got off that train with your little girl. All right, just calm... Hold it! Hold it! Just calm yourself down there. Samuel? -You know this pup? -I told you. What do you have to say for yourself, son? Well, I thought once you got to know me, maybe you'’d change your mind about having a boy and adopt me. -So you sneaked into the wagon? -Yes, sir. Manly, what are we gonna do? We gotta take him back. What did sheriff have to say? We got to go on to Milford. The train has a two-day layover there. He thinks we ought to be able to catch up to it. Not if we take him back to Mankato. All right, we'’ll have to take him with us. Only until we find Rose. And we'’re gonna drop you in Mankato on the way back. Yes, sir! Come on. We got a long drive ahead of us. Well, come on, Samuel. You can call me Sam. [chuckles] This one here. The blue wool scarf. Well, I can get that for you by Christmas. But... it'’s kind of expensive, Jason. I'’ll get the money, Mr. Oleson, somehow. All right. I'’ll order it for you today. -Thank you. -Father! Father! Father! Oh, hello, Jason. Look, father, another Christmas present for me from mother. Well, put it upstairs in your room with the others. Too bad you won'’t be getting any Christmas presents this year. -Nancy! -It'’s true. Willie said Mr. Carter gave Almanzo money to buy Christmas presents. And now Jason and Jeb won'’t have any Christmas at all. That is about enough out of you. It doesn'’t matter if Mr. Wilder comes back or not, Santa Claus will still bring us ourpresents. -That'’s right. -Heh-heh! Do you still believe in Santa Claus? Oh, you'’re so childish, Jason. He may not come to your house, but he'’ll come to ours. [scoffs] Don'’t pay any attention to anything she says. I'’ll have your scarf here next week. -Thanks, Mr. Oleson. -You bet. I'’ve got your order back here. How is Harriet? [Nels] I got a letter from her yesterday, complaining about the hospital food. Says the nurses never come when she calls for them. Sounds like she'’s feeling more herself these days. Yes, it does, doesn'’t it? Well, I, I hope she'’s out of the hospital and home by Easter. Mm. Do you want all of these? I read. Yeah. [knocking on door] [humming] [knocking on door] Yes? I want to talk to you, young lady. Oh, father, I'’m the luckiest girl in the world to have all these Christmas presents. And I was thinking, since the Carter children don'’t have any Christmas presents at all, perhaps I should share. I could give them one of mine. Well... that'’s a lovely, generous thought, Nancy. Um, I thought... maybe I could give '’em this one. I already peeked. It'’s just an eraser from Willie and Rachel. I am afraid that you don'’t appreciate the real meaning of Christmas, Nancy. Sure I do, father. It'’s a time when we all give presents to the ones we love the most. And if I happen to get more presents than anyone else, it'’s just because I deserve it. It'’s because your mother spoils you rotten! You really do hate me, don'’t you? Now, don'’t start that again. It seems to me that you'’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of Christmas so far this year, but I haven'’t seen very much giving. I'’m thinking about it. Well, while you'’re thinking about it, I'’ve got a job for you. A job? Well, everyone is contributing to Christmas together as a family. Your mother sent these packages. I'’m preparing the Christmas dinner, Willie and Rachel will read from the Bible after dinner. I'’ll sing "Silent Night." I want you to be in charge of getting the Christmas tree. The tree? Where am I gonna get a tree? The woods are full of them, my dear. Why can'’t you get one? Or Willie? We are busy with the store and the restaurant. Besides, I want you to do something to contribute to the spirit of Christmas. [sighs] And I wouldn'’t waste much time in pouting if I were you, young lady. [grunts] I hate trees. [whinnying] [sighs] You'’ve been mighty quiet all night. -Just thinkin'’. -Mm. Sometimes it helps to think out loud. I have to find a way to get some money, and fast. Mm. This wouldn'’t have anything to do with Christmas, would it? I was counting on Mr. Wilder. And now he'’s not coming back. I have to find a way to get Ma'’s Christmas present. Maybe you don'’t need any money. I bet if you put your mind to it, you could think of something to give her that you could make yourself. A drawing. You could whittle something out of wood. No matter what it is, if it comes from the heart, she'’s gonna love it. Yeah, but this was special, Pa. [John chuckles] You sleep on it and you'’ll see by tomorrow morning I'’m right. [Jason] Pa? You don'’t think... [John] I don'’t think what? You don'’t think that just because Mr. Wilder isn'’t coming back... you don'’t think Santa Claus will skip us this year too, do you? Of course not. [exhales] I didn'’t think so. Goodnight, Pa. Goodnight, son. -All right. -Goodnight, Ma. Mm. Goodnight, son. Well, did you find out what'’s bothering him? He'’s worried about what he'’s gonna get his ma for Christmas. Oh. I told him whatever he got for you, especially if he made it himself, you'’d love it. Of course I would. I'’m just wondering what kind of Christmas the boys are gonna have. If Almanzo doesn'’t get back in time... [sighs] it'’s gonna be pretty meager pickings under the tree. Well, there'’s nothing we can do about it. It wasn'’t your fault. I know. I can explain it to Jeb. But Jason, he still thinks Santa Claus is coming. Oh, I know it. Maybe it'’s time we told him. Oh, Sarah, I don'’t wanna do that. -Do you? -No. Well, then let'’s just keep our fingers crossed. Maybe they'’ll be back in time. Well, no matter what, we'’ll be together. And that is more important than any gift. You'’re right. Of course. [sighs] I hope the Wilders would be as blessed. [sizzling] Oughta consider it. Lotta things a boy can do around the house. Take me for instance. -Why, chop wood, I suppose. -Well, yes. -Cook meals. -I can do that, too. [chuckles] Listen, I think you'’re a real fine boy, Sam. -You do? -Yeah, sure I do. Somebody'’s gonna be mighty lucky to get you for a son. But me, see, I, uh, kinda got my own way, you understand? I don'’t eat much. [laughs] All right, let'’s get this stuff loaded. I can do it. I'’m real strong. See what I mean? Who can tell me the answer to this one? That'’s it! -[Etta] Jason? -Hm? You said you had the answer to the problem. Oh, no, ma'’am. But you said, "That'’s it." Yeah, but that isn'’t what I said "That'’s it" about. [kids laughing] Oh, I see. Well, try to figure that one out. In the meantime, class is dismissed. Jeb, tell Ma I might be late for supper. I have something to do. -What? -I can'’t tell you. She'’ll skin me alive! I can'’t tell her you'll be late for no reason. Tell her it'’s about Christmas. And I'’ll explain later! Well, that-- that sounds like a mighty fine offer, Jason, but, uh, well, I'’m-- I'm afraid I'’m not in the market for anything like that. Well, thanks, anyway, doc. I don'’t understand. I haven'’t been able to sell one tree yet to anybody. Doesn'’t anybody have a Christmas spirit? Well, I guess folks have a Christmas spirit all right, Jason, but, uh, well, folks around here, they can go out and chop down their own tree and bring it home and put it up themselves. I guess they don'’t see the need to pay somebody to do that for '’em. Are you gonna chop down your own tree? You bet. I do it every year. Helps me get in the Christmas mood. But what if you don'’t know how to chop down a tree? Well, everybody around here knows how to chop down a tree. Not everybody. Okay, thanks, Doc Baker. [door shuts] [chuckles] Absolutely not! [Jason] Doesn'’t anybody have a Christmas spirit? Mr. Montague, you can'’t chop down your own tree, can you? Of course not. Then if you don'’t buy one from me, where are you gonna get one? I don'’t intend to have one. But everybody has a tree. Not everyone, my lad. I'’ve never been able to comprehend the absurdity of chopping down a live tree, jamming it into a space far too small for it, crowning it with garish ornaments and leaving it there to die. Hm-hm! Then if you don'’t have a tree, where do you put the presents? Jason, my boy, try to understand. The idea of giving presents was drummed up by the merchants of our land in order to line their own pockets. The message of Christmas is one of love, not of mindless merchandising. Do you understand what I'’m saying? You don'’t have any presents to put under the tree. Ah, splendid. [chuckles] [sighs] [door opens] [bells jingling] [Nancy] Any packages for me? No, not today. Uh, but Jason Carter'’s package arrived. If you see him, uh, you can tell him it'’s here. By the way, Willie and Rachel wanted to know when they should come over and, uh, help trim the Christmas tree. Whenever they want to. Well, we can'’t very well trim a tree we haven'’t got, can we? You don'’t really expect me to get the tree? You have until Christmas Eve night. Uh, supper will be ready in about ten minutes. -You wanna get washed up? -[Nancy] I'’m busy. What are you doing? Putting up my Christmas list. I wouldn'’t want anyone to buy me something I don'’t like. [hammering] I can'’t believe it. She is so much like Harriet, it'’s unbelievable. Just can'’t believe it. [door opens] [bells jingling] We'’re closed. That'’s all right. I just came to tell your father something. Father! Father! You can tell him for me. Tell him... Tell him not to send away for that scarf. I can'’t buy it. It already arrived. See? Well, I can'’t buy it. W-- what are we supposed to do with it? Sell it to someone else, I guess. I was gonna chop down Christmas trees to earn the money for it, but seems like nobody needs a Christmas tree. I'’m sorry. Wait! Oh... Wait! Did you say Christmas trees? Yeah. You know, Jason... I think we just might be able to make a deal for this scarf. Thank you, ma'’am. -Uh, you got her? -Come on. Up we go. -Thank you. -Thank you. Mm-hmm. Pony! Oh... Oh... -Mm... -Oh... Oh, my God... [sighs] Thank God you'’re home. I was so worried about you. Oh, Patrick... Oh... Uh, the baby... I know. I got a wire from Dr. Langley. I know everything. He sounded so worried about you. And then I didn'’t hear from you, and I got scared. Can we sit down for a minute? [sighs] Here. Did the doctor tell you that I can'’t... Yes. When he told me that, I wanted to die. -Mm-mm... -I did. But not anymore. Oh, Patrick, there'’s been a miracle. -A miracle? -Yes, I... Come, let me show you. There'’s our miracle. I don'’t understand. Where'’d this child come from? She had been abandoned at the hospital, and the nurses told me that they couldn'’t find her parents and that she'’d have to be sent to an orphanage. Patrick, don'’t you see? It'’s as if God had given us the child he'’d taken away. [Elsa] Don'’t you see? I couldn'’t let her be sent to a workhouse. Well, of course not. Please, please tell me you'’ll let her stay. [chuckles] Well, it'’s just such a shock. Dr. Langley didn'’t mention anything about a little girl. Well, he didn'’t know. It happened right before we left to come home. Oh. Now, I know this is sudden for you. Please, Patrick. [sobbing] I need her. She'’s such a lovely child. You'’ll love her, too, you'’ll see. -Please-- -Of course she can stay. Oh... Oh... -Thank you. -Mm... I love you. I love you, too. Does she have a name? Rose. Ah, Rose. Well, you'’re welcome to your new home. [sighs] You'’ll never fit through the front door. I better trim a little bit off. I thought you were out getting the tree. I'’m thinking about it. Well, maybe you can think it already decorated, then we won'’t have to go to the trouble. Now, I am going in and start the supper. You get yourself to the woods and fetch the tree. -Father-- -Now, Nancy! Why do you hate me? Now, Nancy! The axe is by the table. [knocking on door] [sighs] Well, it'’s about time. -Well, where is it? -Right here. Oh. [laughs] That'’s very amusing. -Now, where is the tree? -That'’s it. That'’s the whole tree, Nancy. It'’ll look much bigger once you get it inside. You could put it on a table. You told me you'’d get me a big, beautiful Christmas tree. Well, it was big and beautiful, but-- You expect me to take that, that disgrace into my living room? It won'’t hardly take any time at all to decorate. Jason Carter, I don'’t ever wanna see you again. What about the scarf? [door slams] Nancy, what are you doing? I'’m not feeling well. Well, you'’re gonna feel a lot worse when you don'’t have any presents on Christmas. I have lots of presents. No tree, no presents. But mother sent me those presents. Father will take them away. If I were you, I'’d get out there and get chopping. I can'’t carry a big tree all that way. Well, get a small tree. How small? I don'’t know, just a tree! Be right back. Jason! Jason! Oh, he'’s gone. Why did he take that dumb tree? Now I'’m gonna have to go all the way to the woods and... I bet Jenny would like to have you in her living room. I bet she can'’t chop down a tree, either. Jason! Come in! I figured with Almanzo gone you might need a... [Jenny] Need a what? Oh, never mind. You want some hot chocolate? No. What are you dragging that branch around for? It'’s not a branch. It'’s a tree. -Is, uh, Mr. Montague upstairs? -Mm-hmm. Okay. Thanks. [vocalizing] [knocking on door] Yes? It'’s open. [humming] Ah! Young Carter. Come in. Come in. What on earth is that? -A Christmas tree. -[Montague] Hm. A Christmas tree! And just because it'’s little, it doesn'’t mean it isn'’t full of Christmas spirit. -Oh. Is that so? -Yes, that is so. I bet the only reason you don'’t like Christmas trees is because you'’ve never had a Christmas tree. Well, now that you mention it, I never did. Even when you were a kid? Mother hated the way the needles got into everything. Difficult to clean. But, Mr. Montague, everybody should have a Christmas tree. I'’m gonna give you mine. Now, look here, Jason, I'’m not going to be bamboozled into purchasing this scrawny little tree. I'’m not selling it to you. I'’m giving it to you. Merry Christmas! My word. Merry Christmas. [thudding] [wood creaking] You really do hate me, don'’t you? Yes! [sobbing] Well, this is as good a place to start as any. I'’ll head over to the depot and look around. All right, we'’ll meet you back here at the sheriff'’s office. All right. -Uh, Beth. -What is it? -Rose'’s picture. Where is it? -It'’s in my bag, -in the back of the wagon. -I'’ll get it. Sam? What are you doing with that picture? We'’re going in to talk to the sheriff. We want you to wait here for us until we get back. [Sam] Mr. Wilder? What happens when you find Rose? We'’ll start back home. Back to the orphanage, you mean. Well, I'’m not going back. [Rose cooing] Thank you, Mrs. Martin. Here you go. -Oh, she'’s a beautiful child. -Mm... You and your husband must be very proud. Yes, we are. She'’s everything to us. What'’s your name? [cooing] Rose. Rose Norris. -Ah. Your only child? -Yes. [clamoring] [Rose mumbles] What is it? Boys! Part of my brood. Matthew, Mark, Luke and Johnny. I got 12 of my own. All boys. You see, Mrs. Baker, my wife, very religious, uh, named '’em all after Biblical folk. [chuckles] You like that, darlin'’? Mm-hmm? Oh, well, pack up your order. [Elsa] Thank you. Need any help? No, I have all the help I can manage. Lot of things a boy can do to help out. Take me for instance. Now, look here, son. You don'’t have to tell me about boys. I got 12 of my own. Probably wouldn'’t even notice one more. I'’m real strong and I don'’t eat hardly anything at all. [chuckles] -Will there be anything else? -Not today. Up we go. Your pa will be worried about us if we don'’t get back. -Thank you, Mr. Baker. -You'’re welcome, Mrs. Norris. Bye-bye, Rose. Merry Christmas. Rose? Lot of people comin'’ into the area every day. I can'’t say your little girl is not here. But I haven'’t seen her. At least you got here before the train pulls out again. We'’ve got about an hour before it leaves. That ought to give us plenty of time to go look over all the passengers. You go with him. I'’ll check the hotels. Oh, there. Sam, I thought I asked you to wait in the wagon. Yes, sir, but... But what? Nothin'’, I, I just got lonely out in the wagon. Let'’s get goin'. All right, Sam, come on, you come with me. [chuckling] It looks mighty good, Mrs. Carter. Thank you, Jenny. I wish Mr. Montague would'’ve come over with you. Perhaps you can take him some supper later. Yes, ma'’am. Oh, he said to tell you that he doesn'’t believe in all the... He had a real fancy word for it. Oh, yeah, the folderol around Christmas. [laughing] He doesn'’t even believe in Christmas trees, either. -You'’re kidding? -All right. -Now let'’s all bow our heads. -Mr. Carter? If you don'’t mind, I'’d like to ask the prayer. No, of course I don'’t mind, Jenny. Dear Lord, we'’re very grateful for all the blessings You have bestowed on us this Christmas... and we thank Thee for seeing that we have this wonderful food and loving friends. And we know that You have many, many people to look over tonight. But, Lord, if You have a little extra time and You could find it in Your heart, do you think You could lead Laura and Almanzo to Rose? Thank You. Amen. -[Sarah] Amen. -[Carter] Amen. [Edwards] Listen, if she didn'’t get on the train with Rose, that means she'’s somewhere in this area. All we have to do is search the surrounding farms. That could take days. Well, the main thing is that we keep quiet about it so she doesn'’t get wind of us and bolt. Darlin'’... She'’s here somewhere. We'’re going to find her. [scoffs] It'’s so black out... There'’s not a single star in the sky. You know, I just realized it'’s Christmas Eve... We should be sitting around the table having turkey... hanging our stockings. [sobbing] Oh, God, we'’re never gonna find her. -We are. -No, we'’re not! Why did you leave her? I asked you to stay with her! -You know what happened. -Oh, yeah, I know. I know what happened. Isaiah had one of his stupid fights, and you had to leave our baby to go and help him! Laura, now, stop it! Just stop it. [sobbing] I saw her today. What? I saw Rose. [Almanzo] Hello! Is anyone there? [banging on door] Open up! What'’s all the racket? We'’re closed. This is very important! We have to talk to you! Don'’t you know it'’s Christmas Eve? Go on home. We'’re trying to find our daughter! I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. Come back in the morning. You open this door or we'’ll bust it in! Oh, oh, all right, what do you want? We'’re trying to find our daughter. She was in your store today. Mm-hmm. Let me see. Well, yeah, yeah, she was in here, but she was with her ma. -Who brought her in? -Well, I told you, her ma. Look, I don'’t understand all this. You don'’t have to. Who brought her in? The name? Uh, Mrs. Norris. Uh, first time I met her. I know her husband, his name is Patrick. Uh, but, uh, this is her little girl, all right. -Do you know where they live? -Yeah. I'’ve made a delivery out there. Kinda remote, though. -Hard to find in the dark. -[Edwards] We'’ll find it. Then let me get you a map. Be easier to show you. [sighs] [Almanzo] I told you. Thank God. [Laura sighs] -The... -Who could that be? What... Who are you? Rose! [sighs] Oh... Oh... Hold it right there. Put her down. Put our daughter down. Your daughter? Get them out of here. [Patrick] I'’m warning you, put her down! -Almanzo! -[Almanzo] Take her out, Beth. [Patrick] I told you, put her down! Put my daughter down! [Almanzo] She'’s not your daughter. [Laura] Stop it, both of you! [Patrick] It'’s your last chance. Put her down! No, Patrick. No. Leave them alone. She'’s their daughter. She belongs to them. I took her. [sobbing] I thought they'’d never find us. I wanted a-- a child so much... [sobbing] When I lost my baby, something happened to me. And then I saw Rose and... [sighs] the next thing I knew, we were on the train. I-I'’m sorry, Patrick. [Elsa sobbing] My wife has been through a terrible time. I know you have every right to press charges against her... but-- There'’ll be no charges. Thank you. I'’m sorry. I took real good care of her. She'’s beautiful. [Rose cooing] Rose and I will ride in the back with Sam. I'’m never lettin' her out of my sight again. Don'’t worry. We'’ll be right behind you. You'’re never gonna lose us. Let'’s go. There you go. Almanzo? Almanzo? -Is Sam up front? -No. Well, he'’s gone. Tarnation, where is that boy? Samuel! Sam! He ain'’t gonna answer. He took off. Now, why would he go and do a thing like that? '’Cause he didn't wanna go back to the orphanage. Oh. I should'’ve known. I should have seen it. He kept askin'’ me. "What happens when we find Rose? When do we go back?" That'’s why he didn't tell us right off he'’d seen her. -Oh, we'’ve got to find him. -Let'’s go. [Laura] Sam? [Almanzo] Samuel, come back! ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round yon Virgin ♪ Mother and Child ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender and mild ♪ Sleep in ♪ Heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in ♪ Heavenly peace [chuckles] That was real pretty. -I love Christmas carols. -Oh, so do I. We better get to bed so Santa Claus could come. I'’m gonna give him some milk and cookies. [sighs] -Maybe we should tell him. -Oh... He'’s gonna be disappointed come mornin'’. I know it. Well, why don'’t you? I was hopin'’ you would. We'’ll both tell him. Oh, there. He oughta like those cookies. Jason. Yes, sir? There'’s something... your ma wants to tell you. Yeah, Ma? Jason... Uh, son, you'’re at an age now where... Well, what I mean is... [knocking on door] You go ahead, I'’ll get it. [laughing] Merry Christmas! He'’s here! He's here! Why, of course I am! [laughs] I told them we should'’ve been in bed, Santa. I told them. That'’s all right, young Jason. Now... let'’s see what we have here. For, for, uh, Jenny. Music box. Thank you, Santa. [chuckles] And, uh, Jeb. A tackle box. It'’s full of stuff! Look it, Pa. Hooks and lures. It'’s got everything! Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho... John Carter. Land sakes. That'’s a beauty. I don'’t know what to say. Oh. Uh, thank you would do nicely. Thank you. Ho-ho-ho. [all laughing] And, uh, Master, uh, Jason. A watch! My very own watch! Now I'’m grown up! Thank you, Santa! Uh, y-- you'’re welcome. Don'’t you have anything for my mom? Mm. Let me see. [Jason] She'’s been a good ma. Oh, I'’m sure she has. Hm. Ah! Here we are. I knew it! I knew it. Santa knows everything! Uh, very true. Oh. It'’s lovely. Thank you. Merry Christmas to all... [chuckles] ...and to all a good night. [laughing] Excuse me. Santa? If you see Mr. Montague... tell him we love him. I shall. [Almanzo] Samuel! Samuel! Samuel! Samuel! It'’s gonna be near impossible to find him until daylight. We'’re gonna have to, it'’s gonna get down mighty cold before mornin'’. Are there any other folks livin'’ close by? He wouldn'’t be shy about askin'’ them to take him in. No. We'’re to hell and gone out here. Dear God, where is he? [bell tolling] Isaiah, look. That star. Only one in the sky. I'’ve never seen anything like that out here. Come on, let'’s go. Let'’s bundle him up, get him back to your place. We'’ll bed you down there for the night. Thank you. Amen. Everybody'’s asleep. You should have seen it tonight, half-pint. The star? Never seen anything like it. That'’s what Almanzo said. It was like... a miracle. Why not? It is Christmas Eve. And the angel said unto them... "Fear not... for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people." "For unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." "This shall be his sign unto you... ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." There'’s not gonna be much of a Christmas for that babe we found tonight. Oh, I'’m gonna hate takin'’ him back there. [door shuts] [birds chirping] [horse snorts] I wanna thank you for your help last night. It'’s me who should be thankin'’ you. -I'’m sorry about everything. -I know. [sighs] I-- I made some extra biscuits for your trip. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I felt so sorry for the boy. -You don'’t suppose-- -Well, what would you say if-- Are you thinking what I'’m thinking? Yes. Oh, Patrick... yes. [Patrick] Edwards! Hey, Edwards! Wait up! Ho-ho, ho-ho! What'’s wrong? Well, uh, nothing'’s wrong. Uh, Elsa and I got to thinkin'’ about Sam and... I mean, he wants a family and... Well, we'’d like to be his folks. You do? [chuckles] Well, uh, if you'’ll have us. Afraid I can'’t make the trip back with you. Mr. and Mrs. Norris need a son awful bad. I'’ll get my stuff, Dad! We'’ll let 'em know at the orphanage in Mankato. Thank you. I can'’t believe it. I got a home! Good luck, Sam. -Let'’s go home. -Hyah! Wait till you see! A lot of things a boy can do around the house. You'’d be surprised. Well, like the boy said, let'’s go home. [Laura] "For unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." "This shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
