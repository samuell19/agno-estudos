This is Tye Watson. Leave a message. Hey, Tye. Dinner's waiting. Love you. Mommy. Mommy? Hey. Hey there, sweetie. Did you have a nightmare? Okay. Well, let's get you tucked in. Get you safe and sound and tucked in. All right? Mommy's here. Mom! Where's Daddy? He'll be home soon. I got you some apples. He's not hiding under your bed, is he? - No! - No? No? What are you coloring? Daddy and flowers and me. Aw, such a good picture. 'morning, Rachel, Ella. Lovely day, isn't it? Are you two thinking of selling your house? I'm sorry, but I saw a realtor's car the other day. We're happy here. We have no plans to move. I didn't see Tye leave on his bike this morning. How's he doing? I was so sorry to hear about his mom. Thank you for your concern, as always, DeeDee. He's out of town visiting family. Have a good day. - Bye, DeeDee. - Bye. What the... Go grab your coat, sweetie. Mommy's got to run some errands. Damn it. He's our most popular teacher. And a good guy too. Nice to see you. - It's so good to see you. - How you feeling? Tye hasn't updated me lately. And it's my fault for not asking. - I'm doing great. - I'm glad to hear that. Let's walk. - Okay. - We're having a spring social at my place. - I hope you can make it. - I'll be there. I just was wondering if I could have a quick word with Tye. I tried to call him, but... He's not in today. Didn't he tell you? No, he got up before me. So I didn't get a chance to talk to him. He didn't show up for the staff meeting. I assumed he was sick, so I brought in one of his subs, you know, from his list. One of the subs he likes. - You know Tye... Mr. Organized. - Yeah. Is... is everything okay? I mean, I don't mean to pry. No, that's fine. Everything is great. I just had a quick question for him. Well, you have him call me. - I hope he's feeling okay. - Okay, I will. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. No, I haven't heard a word. I've been driving around looking. That'd be great. I'll meet you there. Rachel, come on, you gotta call the police. Something's not right here. Well, at first I thought he just needed some space, with his mom dying and school pressure, but he's basically been gone for two days without a word. His mom died two months ago. I mean, this is weird. I'm sure he's okay. It's like me when I lost it. Stop that. You did not lose it. You needed some time to focus on you. Yeah, but I... I shut down, kept to myself. You know, he might be doing the same thing. I don't think so. Rachel, this is really out of character for Tye. You know that. You need to call the police. Why wouldn't you? I just... Everything is probably fine. Yeah, you're sure acting that way. Come on. Come on. Call the police. Want one more bite? Can I go play now? Of course, sweetheart. Thank you so much. I needed this. So, when was the last time you spoke to your husband? Yesterday. It was two mornings ago, before he went to school. And he drives to Cedar Ridge High? No, he... He rides his bike to school. Um, we only have the one car. Okay. Did he say anything to you before he left for work that day? No, nothing out of the normal everyday stuff. Well, did he say anything about his work, um, who he was meeting, what his plans were for the week? No. Did you guys have a fight that day? No, we don't fight. I mean, everybody fights. We don't. So you have the perfect marriage? Come on, stop. Don't say it like that. We have a marriage, so that means we have to work at it. And it's a good marriage. I love my husband. Look, I don't want you to be offended by these questions. Okay? It's just information that I need to know. Has anything like this ever happened before? Does he disappear, then come back a few days later? Anything like that? Just when he passes out at Steve's. Sorry. He's always connected to his phone. So if he does stay at a friend's, like his buddy Steve, he'll call before so I don't worry. He's... he's always been really good at that. All right. Well, I'm going to need a photograph of him, something preferably recent, if possible. Also I need to get the information on his buddy Steve. -You just write that down for me... -Sure. And I'll follow up on that later. What happened to your finger? Nothing. Just some broken glass. Yeah. Mind if I look around? Yeah, sure, I guess. Aw. I gotta tell you, your daughter is absolutely adorable. - You just have the one kid? - Yeah. - Do you have kids? - No, no, no. Here's that picture of Tye you wanted. Is that the picture from my nightstand? Yeah. No, no, this is great. This is exactly what I need. Thank you. Well. It's pretty damn tidy for a man cave. He likes to keep it that way. He's an organized guy. His whole life is. This is the bike that he usually rides to work? Yeah. Well, didn't make it far on it this time, did he? Unfortunately, it hasn't been long enough for me to officially open up a case, not without any clear evidence of wrongdoing. But I will look into this more. Miss Wilson, is there any reason your husband wouldn't want to come home? No. No reason at all. I didn't want to ask this inside in front of your friend, but is there a possibility that he was seeing someone? - Or... - Having an affair? No. Okay. Thank you. I'll be in touch. And don't worry. He'll turn up or we'll find him. What you got? Possible missing husband. 48 hours and counting, no calls, nothing. He's probably out banging his side piece. - Yeah, maybe. - Maybe it's an open marriage. You are no help. What? I tell you what. Why don't you do a report run on Mr. Tye Wilson, 40, teacher at Cedar Ridge High, - and also look into his buddy Steve? - Okay. I'm gonna talk to the neighbor. All right. I'm on it. And learn to park your car. It's in the lines, man! Can you tell me a little bit about Mr. Wilson? - He's such a lovely man. - Mommy! Always takes time to say hello. First drop of snow, he shovels my walk, not that we get a lot of snow. But, you know, I've taken over dinner to them a few times. And they don't seem social. At least, she doesn't. But I just like to check in - and see how they're doing. - Of course. Have you seen anything out of the ordinary around their house the last few days? other than a Realtor car, nothing out of the ordinary. But they seem... Well, no, he does... He seems very grounded. And their daughter is adorable. She goes to a friend of mine for daycare. And she's just doing so well. She's such a bright little girl. And she's good with the other kids too. I take it you don't have the same affections for Mrs. Wilson? Well, she's just a different person. She's just not as friendly. I heard she wasn't well for a bit. And she was in the hospital for a very long time due to a miscarriage. A little baby boy. Bless their hearts. Do you know why she was hospitalized so long - just because of a miscarriage? - Not a clue. But I don't like to pry, you know. I'm not the nosy-neighbor type. Of course not. Well, I really appreciate your time. And if you happen to think of anything else, please give me a call. I will. - Have a lovely day. - Thank you. "Senior Detective." Wow. I'm Detective Ferguson. Cedar Ridge P.D. Just wanted to catch up with you about your coach, - Mr. Wilson. - Yeah, he's a great coach. He led us to two championships. So you like him? He's a good guy? For sure. But he hasn't been in the last few days. Yeah. Is everything okay? No need to worry. We saw his wife was here the other day. She ignored us. Is that unusual behavior? She's been sick a lot. How'd you hear that? Tye said she went mental. You mean Mr. Wilson? Right, yeah. Mr. Wilson. He likes us to call him Tye. Really? Come on, Kinna. We'd better get to class. Bye. Have a good day. - Thanks. - Yeah. Have a good practice. "Tye." Okay, got you ladies some milk, some yogurt, some Goldfish crackers, 'cause they are Miss Ella's favorite. Yeah. And, some chocolate, 'cause when I'm stressed, I need chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate. - Here, you want some? - Yes, thank you. So you seem to be holding up okay. I don't really have an option, do I? Falling down sobbing isn't going to help Ella. Just, I've already done that. Not this time. Just keeping busy with the list that Tye left for me. Yeah. I'm sure he'll come back tonight. Yeah, you're probably right. All right. Are you sure you don't need me for anything else? All right. - Thank you. - You keep those. Yeah. I'll take these. Bye. - See you tomorrow. - "Bye, Auntie." Bye, Jessie. Hey, boys. Ma'am, mind if we come in? - Sure. - Thank you. Hey, sweetie, will you go play in your room for a little while? Okay, thank you so much. Detective Ferguson, I was not expecting you tonight. Sorry for stopping by unannounced. Um, this is my partner, Detective Roper. We need to let you know that this has now officially become a missing persons case. You understand what that means? Unfortunately yes. We'll be distributing his photo to the other departments, bus station, airports, the usual exit points. We'll also be running a check on his credit card, bank statements, his cell phone records. That kind of stuff. It'll help us a lot. Anything you'd like to tell us now before the media get a hold of this? Media? Yes, there will likely be some attention from the press. Your husband's very well-known in this town. He's well-liked, respected. People without enemies don't just disappear. But we would prefer you don't make any statements. You can leave that to us. Um, am I supposed to be getting a lawyer? Um... that I can't advise you on. We will be having an officer in the neighborhood out here. And if you happen to hear from your husband, please call us right away. We're going to have another look around outside. Again, apologies for interrupting. Aren't wives usually upset when their husbands go missing? Phoo! Not my wife. She loved it when I was gone. I don't blame her. That's why I moved here. You gotta meet a new girl. Man, this place is tidy for a man cave. It's nice. Flat screen, DVD collection. Nice lookin' wife. Damn, nice wheels. Guy's a serious rider? Hey, Roper, want to get your ass off the evidence? Yeah. I got something here. Yep. "Rachel Wilson." Well... Wellbutrin? It's an anti-depressant. Odd place to keep your prescriptions. Even empty ones. Yeah, something doesn't add up. G this so well. I'd be a wreck. I am a wreck. I have to stay calm for Ella. She has no idea what's happening. All right, so talk to me. What was going on with you and Tye? Like, the last time you saw him? How was everything? Fine. Fine? Wow. You are a terrible poker player. We have been friends for years and that is not the "everything is just fine" face. It was. I mean, you know what he's like. So focused on school stuff, always going to meetings, ballgames, field trips. So there was no chance for us to, you know... we didn't connect. Do you think he was seeing somebody? No. A lot of guys cheat. Mine certainly did. All three of yours did. Yeah, well, I'm sure Tye didn't. After I was stuck in the hospital for so long, there was a real distance between us. And he told me all the time how horrible it was for him, that he lost the son he always wanted. Well, you know you can't blame yourself. Then who else? I think if there was a change in our relationship, it happened then. He ends up being a parent on his own. Whoa. Back up, no. Do not say that. And, you know, maybe it was good for him to look after you and Ella. Think of that? You're probably just really pissed because he pulled away. I was never angry at him. Just disappointed. I gotta go. Thanks for the... the drink. Yeah. Afternoon, Miss Harvey. I'm Detective Roper. Right, hi. Just want to ask you a few questions, if that's okay. Sure. How long have you known Mrs. Wilson? Um, like five years. We became instant best friends. How is she holding up? She is doing okay. Really? Yeah. Um, I mean, she's worried. And, um, a little mad at Tye for disappearing on her, but she's keeping it together. She's mad at Tye? Um, you know, it's hard on any marriage when one spouse is sick for so long and unavailable. You know, I don't feel very comfortable talking about my friend. If you have any questions, you should really ask Rachel. Of course. Just checking in. But, look, if you can think of anything, or need anything, here's my card. Let me know. Yeah. Roper. Yeah, I'm on my way. That's him. He's a teacher at your high school? - Yeah. - All right. The two of you happy with him as a teacher? You know what? Why don't we start in the living room instead? Just document everything, make note of anything out of the ordinary. The usual. I'll be in there shortly. You've searched my house twice. I wasn't certain that this was a missing persons case. But I definitely am now and this is necessary. - I'm going now. - You're more than welcome - to stay and watch if you'd like. - Why would I? I have to grab a few things before I go. Ella, you ready? It would be best if you left everything exactly the way that it is, please. And I'm going to need a list of all the people who have been here since... your husband went missing. It's a short list. Just me and my friend. I'll still need that. Why are you doing this? Well, you want us to find her father, right? Hey, sweetie. Then forensics needs to do a sweep. Okay. Hey. That is a serious antidepressant. Oof. Getting your hair done, Rachel? Grieving. Really? Do you have a comment about your missing husband? - No, how... how did you... - It's all over the Internet. - How long has he been missing? - Just please leave me alone. Reports online say that he may have been kidnapped. -Have you received a ransom note, or... -No, I don't... - Are you planning on attending the search party? - A search party? I don't... Your husband's school is organizing it. - I don't know... - It's... it's your husband. Would... wouldn't you want to go and look for him? So he just vanished? No signs of kidnapping or foul play. You checked the garage again, right? Yeah. Nada. No blood, no notable other substances. The only thing that we found was a third-party's prints on the med bottles, but that could be anyone's. Could be the pharmacy's. My thinking is Mr. Wilson didn't go unwillingly. There's no signs of a struggle or anything to indicate that it wasn't consensual. Well, it's possible to be forced to do something without violence. And no criminal record for either of them? No. Only a minor misdemeanor for him when he was 16. Simple possession. It was stayed. No registered guns around the house, no signs of any guns. Nothing. Coworkers love him, friends love him. The guy had no enemies, which means we've got no suspects. Apparently, he was the greatest guy ever and he just up and disappeared. So it's just a missing persons case at this point. With a wife who isn't reacting the way she should. Which makes us jump to conclusions maybe we shouldn't jump to. No, I think we're missing something. Is there... is there highway cams out here in the sticks? Figures. All right, we got to go back to the top. We gotta interview all the neighbors again, go back to the school, talk to the school staff. You need a warrant, it'll take time and resources. - I mean, come on. - And if we don't do it, we will be criticized for being lazy... and jumping to conclusions. Point taken. Maybe Mrs. Wilson will consent. That would speed things up. She doesn't seem like the consenting type. Let's say it is her. What about motive? Why would she want him gone? You've never been married, have you? Sir? I tried to stop her. You told me there would be no statement. - What the hell did you do? - Hey, hey, take it easy. Okay? What what are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. Somebody made a statement. It didn't come from this office. Well, then how do you explain the reporter at my door, shoving a camera in my face? And thanks a lot for letting me know about the search party. Mrs. Wilson, we have interviewed half the town. This story was going to get out eventually. This is unbelievable. Maybe if you two were actually doing your job, you would have seen it plastered all over the Internet. - Do you want to check the Internet? - Yeah, okay, yeah. I miss the routine, you know? Having him here. He always left lists and things for me to do, always picked up my medications so I never ran out, and now all of that has been completely turned on its head. It is so strange. I don't know how to function without him. You asked me if things were going well. It was like any marriage, I guess. Marriage is hard. Sometimes it's... it's just hard. Yeah. - Do... - What? Nothing. Thank you for being here. You have helped keep my family together. Aw. Please. What are friends for, Rach? We should probably start getting ready for the search party. I don't know. I don't think I can go to that. I think you should go. Why? Well, because it looks really bad if you don't. In the court of public opinion, I pretty much am guilty. That's kind of why you need to go. Is that a picture of you and Tye? Shut up. You love him. What if we find him dead? Don't say that. You'd collapse in tears on his coffin. - My God. No, I wouldn't. - You would so! It's so obvious how much you're into him. Please just shut up. Okay? Do you think it was her? I don't know. Who knows? Or was it you? Because you couldn't have him all to yourself. My God, jerk! Come on, let's go. So stupid. Hi, Rachel. You giving up hope? Have you taken a lie-detector test? Ooh, saucy. Come on. Look at her. That's not a grieving widow. Let's not jump to conclusions, okay? I'm not, and I suggest you don't either. I would like to know who leaked this story, though. I can't stand this guy. What? The obnoxious reporter guy? Hi. I'm Mr. Wilson... Tye's wife. And I just wanted to say thank you guys for coming. What do you got? That's the student from the school. - It's her site. - Yeah. Look at that. She filmed that of Mrs. Wilson? She followed her. Seems like they already think he's dead. I figured that would happen, but just not this quick. Check this out. - "What a stud"? - Yeah. No way. We're standing outside the Wilson house where well-loved high school teacher Tye Wilson has gone missing. Mysterious circumstances, no suspects, and Wilson's wife isn't talking to reporters. I'm just saying what I heard. But I think their marriage was in trouble. Bad trouble. You know what I mean? Yeah. Write that down. Nosy bitch. Get the hell off of my property! But everything was uploaded to your Twitter page. Well, I didn't. You know I can take your phone and your computer. And I'm going to know in a second if you're lying. - Just tell them, Kinna. - Shut up. Kinna, that's enough. Pay attention. Did you post that information about Mr. Wilson or any of the comments? I didn't do anything. How well do you know his wife? What's with that? She doesn't come to school stuff. And he says she's not very friendly. Now come on, Brittany. What, he said that? He said that to you about his wife? Yeah. Well, she's not all there, if you catch my drift. - Don't. - We just can't believe that he's with her. Right, Kinna? He's an amazing teacher. He's got total "trustableness." You mean trustworthy? Whatever. You're awfully quiet. I just hope they find him. He's a great guy. Thank you. Thank you for watching Ella. Yeah. Here are my keys. Thanks. Rach, look at me. Everything's going to be okay. Come here. Thank you. So, Mr. Trafford, you're familiar with Mr. Wilson? Yeah. Yeah, Tye Wilson, he's a... He's a really nice guy, you know? He's popular. He always stops by and says hello to me. I like that. Okay, but you said you knew something else. Yeah. Sorry. Not that it's any of my business, but I've seen him here with a lady late after school. And I... I recognized her. Yeah, okay, from where? She's some real estate woman. I... I saw an ad on a bus stop bench. I sat on her one day. I thought you might want to know that, 'cause he's missing, right? Okay, that's great. But do you have a name? Mr. Trafford? No, I got... I gotta go. Thank you. So you don't have any idea where he is? You ask that like I'm guilty. Look, I don't want to know if you did the crime or not. I just want to know if you need an attorney. Okay, you don't have to prove anything to me, Rachel. That's the D.A.'s job. I have no idea where he is. And now my idiot neighbor is on TV talking about my marriage, as if she knows anything about us. People love attention. You know, they'll make stuff up to maintain it. Okay, now the cops... Okay, the cops are going to do anything to try to find out if he did anything that might warrant you having some sort of motive. That's just the process. The process sucks. Yeah, let me ask you this. Um, who would want to get rid of him? You were telling me that you and Tye were going through a bit of a rough patch. Look, he's going to come back. Okay, everybody's going to forget about this. Rachel, this is far from over. I mean, don't be planning his funeral just yet. And the worried wife... That sends a very good image, right, to the public, to the cops. That's what we want. It's really good to see you, Rach. I wish it was under better circumstances. Restraining order is dated about four years ago. Filed by that real estate agent Alexa Palmer. Well, that plus the janitor's statement means that our guy was seeing someone. And she knew. She was served with the restraining order. So she lied to me. Makes you wonder what else she is lying about. How'd it go with your lawyer? What are you doing here? I wanted to keep this low-key. I need you to come down to the station and answer a few more questions. I will arrest you and put you in handcuffs, march you out there in front of all those cameramen if you don't. It's your choice. Seen this before? Is that a yes? - Yes. - Okay, so you know that there's a restraining order against you. The woman was sleeping with my husband. So you lied to us. That doesn't prove anything. Look, we're not the enemy here. Okay, you say that your husband went missing. We're trying to help you find him. And then this turns up. I get it, okay? I'm not proud of it. The fact that my husband was having an affair. How do you think that makes me feel? I haven't told anyone. Not even my best friend. Please don't harass my client on this topic. Determining relevance is my job. I was humiliated by what he did. This is a small town. People talk. How do you think I would feel walking down the street having everyone know that he screwed that woman? Well, the restraining order alleges violence. - My husband... - There wasn't a question. You don't have to answer anything. No, it's okay. My husband and I had problems. The restraining order was brought by the woman he slept with. My understanding is they're easily obtained. Doesn't mean I was or would be violent. I have no idea how or why she did it. Okay. Are you familiar with this? Where did you find that? So you recognize that? It's my husband's wallet. What do you know that you're not telling me? We found it under your bed. Under my bed? - Are you kidding me? - That's enough. Okay? How dare you show her that knowing his blood's on it? We don't know whose blood it is yet. We will soon enough. Just hoping that your client could save us the effort. She doesn't know. We can go. Where were you the day he went missing? I don't know when he disappeared. So I can't answer exactly where I was. But you said you saw him that morning. I mean, what were you doing that morning? I was home alone with Ella until I dropped her off. Can anybody corroborate that? No. Then that night you decided not to call the police. But the next day, you did go by his school. So I'm suggesting that you went by his school to make it look like you were worried. I was worried. I am worried. According to Principal Turner, it seemed more like a social visit. It wasn't a social visit. What about your hand? I told you... it was nothing. Well, how did it happen? I cut it on some glass. A picture had fallen. When? A few days ago. So the day that your husband went missing? Yeah, I guess so. You seem very calm about all of this. How the hell am I supposed to act? Sobbing and flailing my arms? Is that what you want? I'm supposed to be the textbook mournful spouse, 'cause I'm damn close to that. Maybe that's not me. Why did you tell your neighbor that he went on a business trip? I didn't. I told her he went to visit family. I didn't want to tell her I was worried. God knows, the woman would start an all-out panic. Then where is he? You were hospitalized for postpartum psychosis after your miscarriage. How is that relevant? - Can you tell me why? - Get a warrant, check her medical records yourself. You have all kinds of prescriptions in your house. I have a few. And you have them all over the place, even in the garage. I have no idea what you're talking about. Was it during the time period of your hospitalization that your husband had the affair? You'll have to ask him that. Fair enough. The report says that you had violent tendencies before you were admitted to the hospital. Towards myself. Not to someone else. I have done nothing wrong. Do you hear me? - Nothing. - Well, give me something then that shows me that I shouldn't arrest you, because as of right now, everything we have points to you. I didn't kill Tye. We never said he was killed. I was embarrassed. - Thanks. - Okay, and you're sure that this happened? 'Cause it just... It doesn't seem like Tye. Yes, it happened. It was me it happened to. I'm... I'm over it. Sorry, it just... God, my heart is just breaking for you. Did you ever meet her? Just when she sold us the house. She's attractive. Do you think he's with her now? No. It's over. It's been over. I just want all of this to end. I just want the reporters to go away and people to leave me alone. Rachel, um, why would that woman get a restraining order? I don't know. It just seems like the cops think you know something. Why would you even think that? What? No, I just... You think that I'm lying, don't you? No. Rachel. - You think I know where Tye is? - No, Rachel. But that is exactly what you're saying. That is not what I am saying. I'm just saying that this all seems so strange, okay? I'm trying to figure it out like you are. You know what, I think you should go. Hey. You should go. Rach. Go. Wow. She's good. Very calm until she lost it and went off on you. She's got the guilty look about her. And just what is the guilty look, Roper? I mean, she does have a point here. How is someone supposed to act when their spouse goes missing? I mean, what is the textbook reaction for a situation like that? Because if my spouse were to go missing, I don't know how I would behave. Let's just stick to the facts here. Husband goes missing eight days ago. The first call comes in at 11:43 on day two. She tells the 911 op that her husband's been missing a day and then his bloody wallet is found under her bed. Their bed. And who knows how it got there? She could have put it there, he could have put it there, a third-party could have put it there. We don't even know whose blood it is until we get the results back. Could be animal blood. You can't let assumptions lead the case. Only hard evidence. I checked out his buddy Steve. He's been out of town for two weeks. So he's clean. But I am curious about this student of his, Kinna Andrews. I mean, the amount of stuff that she's been posting on her social media site about this case, and the amount of pictures that she's putting up of Mr. Wilson. I gotta say, it is... It's a bit obsessive. Yeah. Maybe her favorite teacher kept her in for a special detention. You need to do this. I don't think this is such... The public needs to see you. That means the cops see you. Swaying public opinion in these types of cases is extremely important. That's what keeps the D.A. back. I'm not good at talking publicly. People will sympathize with that. Rachel, right now you have nothing going in your favor. I mean, if you get charged, okay, you need all the public support that you can possibly get. Here, this will calm your nerves. I'm not supposed to drink when I'm on antidepressants. What? You never told me that. I was put on antidepressants when I was released from the hospital. Hang on, hang on. You said you were drinking the night that he disappeared. You said you had a bottle of wine. It wasn't the whole bottle. Rachel, you've mixed the drugs. I mean, the antidepressants and the booze. I mean, do you have any idea what this looks like? What kind of shape were you in? I was fine. Do you remember anything that happened that night? I get the feeling even you don't believe me. It doesn't matter what I believe. What do you remember from that night? I fell asleep. That's all. You know, everything that you've done up until now makes it look like you know more than you do. You're not making my job any easier. Dylan, I swear I'm telling the truth. It's a good thing for you I like a challenge. Excuse me, folks, can I have your attention, please? Is there a ransom? Mrs. Wilson has prepared a statement. My name is Rachel Wilson. What did you do to your husband, Rachel? I want to thank everyone for coming here today... Why won't you talk? Are they going to arrest you? Did you kill your husband? I did not do anything to my husband. - He is missing. I want him back. - What did the police want? You know who the other woman is, Rachel? I just want him to come home. All right, that's enough. My client is innocent of everything except being a traumatized and loving wife. What have you advised your client? Thank you. What the hell was that? I was trying to make you look endearing. More importantly, innocent. I don't care how I look. Well, you should, Rachel. Because if they don't find him, guess where all the signs are going to point? Really, we should get you out of here. The cops said I shouldn't go anywhere. They can't stop you. I mean, do you have anywhere you can go? No. My best friend is a little pissed at me right now. Tye and I had a cabin in the mountains, but we had to sell it to pay off my medical bills when I was away. It sucks being a prisoner in your own house. This is not how I expected my life to play out. I don't think he's coming back. Rachel, hey. We're going to figure this out. Okay? I promise you. Thanks. Really? You're not going to believe where our innocent little wife has just gone. Miss Palmer, you stated to one of our officers that you had past relations with Tye Wilson. Is that correct? Yes. About five years ago. I met him when I sold him their house. But you were seen going by his house before he went missing. Was that a personal visit? Yes. We also have information that you're pregnant. One of your coworkers told us. So, um, you've been by his house recently. And you have admitted to having a previous relationship with him. How long did the relationship last? Is it still going on? Is he the father of your baby? Well, it's definitely his kid. She was on her way by there to show him the blood results. How far along is she? Four months. So he's been seeing her this whole time. Yep. My guess is Rachel Wilson knows Alexa Palmer is pregnant. She wants revenge. Yeah. Well, sometimes it's not always that, Roper. Revenge? Look, sometimes people just seem guilty. Okay? They act guilty. They don't help their own cases. She's got motive now, times two. Our primary suspect offs the husband, not only because he was having an affair, but because he continued it and he knocked up the mistress. If he's still alive, we're gonna bring her in, grill her and find him. The clock's ticking, Gus. Man, come on, will you look at the evidence? The affair, the restraining order, the meds she's on, the life-insurance company, the funeral home? Her computer is full of weird searches, and she lied to us. This is solid stuff. Okay, okay, look, you want to get a warrant, Roper? Be my guest. Two beers over here. Chicago, right? Yeah, Chicago. Captain Ferguson. Tough break on that case. You had the murderer and he got off on a technicality. That's rough. I remember... I had a similar situation. Well, not really. But anyway, I had this footage. It was friggin' awesome stuff. Maybe a little grotesque. But, hey, I thought this was going to be my lottery ticket out of this godforsaken racket. But no. Some jackass lawyer from the news station dumps it on some B.S. technicality. Okay, so maybe there was a little trespassing. I mean, the door was open, so whatever. Regardless, I know how you're feeling. Maybe you and me work together here? We can both be heroes. I don't work with bottom-feeders. Pete, your tip's on the counter. See you around. Mrs. Wilson, you are under arrest... Where are you taking my daughter? She'll be with social services. No. She's just a little girl. She's just a little girl! - She's just a little girl! - Rachel, it's okay. - It's okay. I got her. - Take care of her! - I love you! - I got her! Come on, it's okay. Back, back, back. Rachel, where is your husband? Why did you kill him? - Rachel! - Get back! Back, back, back! Buzz us in. Mommy? Hey, sweetheart, what's the matter? Lee and I are having trouble falling asleep. You are? Well, I betcha that if you lie down and close those eyes, that you'll get right to sleep. Mommy's here now. There you go. Mommy's here. You've always wanted that, haven't you? Yes, Tye. I've missed you. Babe, stay. You know I can't. It's too risky. I don't know how long they're going to keep her at the station. Did you do everything I wanted? Of course. Good. Put these in Ella's room. Tye, come on. Haven't we done enough? It's not enough until she's locked up. Trust me. I do. That's good. Now you know you have to get her out to the cabin - for this to work. - Yes, baby. I know. I'm trying. I'm trying. Hey, listen, soon it'll just be you, me and Ella. Once Rachel's out of the picture, we will have the perfect life, the perfect family. I want to speak to my lawyer. He's on his way. You can help yourself out, though, by telling us where your husband is. If I knew, I would tell you. Who goes to a funeral parlor eight days after their spouse goes missing? Who just pops in to a life insurance company? You must know that he's dead. Why don't you ask the life insurance company and the funeral home? My husband's mom died three months ago. It's been tough for money. I don't know where it's all gone. I had to go there to make a payment. Tye always left things for me to do. He's organized like that. He knows that I need to keep busy. Life goes on, detectives. I thought cops didn't jump to conclusions. We're not. We're looking for motive, intention and opportunity. You had all three. That's why we arrested you. You're making presumptions. Well, I presumed that you had a loving relationship based on what you first told me. We do. He had an affair. We... we worked it out. "Had." They're still seeing each other. He's... He's not seeing her. He said that... - She's four months pregnant. - He's definitely the father. Please don't question my client. She's speaking freely. And I'm advising her not to speak. I have a release. Are you kidding me? You don't have the grounds to keep her. Looks like you are free to go, Mrs. Wilson. Excuse us. Hey, get back. Gus? - What's happening? - We just got a call. Someone snooping around the Wilson house. - Let's go. - I was pouring myself a cup of tea. Chamomile, of course. Anyway, it looked like a girl. Young, I think. And she was wearing a sweatshirt and the hood was up. I'm more than positive it was a girl. Okay. Thanks for the info. I'll look into it. Okay. Glad I drove over here for that. Thanks. - Um, but if you... - Kinna. Late night last night? What? Why don't we have a chat? In private? I'll just text you later. This way. Um, what is this about? Just have a seat right down over there. What were you doing at the Wilsons' last night? I wasn't there. We have a witness. That doesn't mean anything. It could have been anyone. Listen, we know that you have been posting an awful lot on the Internet about Mr. Wilson and his wife. I know about the video that you shot of her at the pharmacy. Which leads me to believe you may know something that we don't. So were you at the Wilsons' last night? Okay, fine, I went by there. Why? I gave him a friendship bracelet, okay? I was worried you would find it. You happy now? Did something happen between you and Mr. Wilson? I like him. I'm almost 18. Did he do something to you? No. I swear to God. You can go back to class. Thank you so much for coming over. Please. It's the least I could do. You've been through so much. You've always been here for me. I love you for that. Stop. Well, I am pretty amazing, aren't I? Yes, you are. Hey, you're gonna find Tye. Okay? I know you will. Yep. I keep thinking there's got to be someplace that he would go, right? Like, I don't know, somewhere you went together, somewhere that was special to you? No. Well, call me anytime. You know I'll be here for you. Thank you. Daddy was here. I don't think he was, sweetheart. It was probably just a nice dream. Tye. Hi. Yeah, it's me. Got a minute? Come on, I won't kill you. I have a restraining order. Seriously, you're carrying my husband's baby and you flash that at me? So you were seeing him the whole time? I'm sorry. I had no idea. He said you weren't well and that you were splitting up. I believed him. I shouldn't have. I feel horrible. When's the last time you heard from him? It's been a little while now. He backed right off when I told him I was pregnant. I asked if there was someone else and he said no. I hate to tell you, but there may very well be. Congratulations on your baby. Do you know what you're having? A baby boy. I never got the chance to tell Tye. - What do you mean, you saw his girlfriend? - And get this. This morning, Ella told me that she had a bad dream last night. Thought she heard voices or something. Must have just been the TV. Yeah, jeez. Guess so. 'Cause it was just you there, wasn't it? Yeah, of course. I just wish I knew where Tye was. I really believe in my heart that he's okay. I think he's taunting me. He disappears, leaves his wallet, things for me to do. It's like he's having me set up. Do you think that he would do that? No. I mean, why would he do that? Well, he knew everything that I would do. And the police would think it was me. Even Ella thought she saw him in her dream last night. But it really hit me when the cops started asking questions. I haven't been a good victim. I have been doing everything I shouldn't have been doing. I can see why they would think that. Maybe even you. But no, no. I am going to figure this out. And when I found out, I'm gonna kill him. What? What have I got to lose? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I better go. Thank you for helping me figure all of this out. You have always been there for me. Such a good friend. The only person that I can really trust. I love you. Come here. All right. See you later. Yeah. He's at the cabin. You found this taped to the front door? - Who would have done this? - Jessica. You think Jessica is helping your missing husband frame you? I know she is. I have it on video. She's been playing me the whole time. - We should go to the police. - No. The only problem is, the video has no audio and Tye isn't in the frame. That's why I have to go to the cabin. Rachel, you can't take justice into your own hands. I mean, this is crazy. As your lawyer, I wouldn't normally tell you to do this. Be careful. And don't worry. I got Ella. Thanks. She's on her way. Roper. Whoa, hang on. Slow down. Okay, thank you. That was Jessica Harvey. She said Rachel Wilson is talking about killing her husband. Great. Just when I was starting to think that she was innocent. - Yes? - Rachel, where are you? - I'm home. - Really? 'Cause I was just there, and you were nowhere in sight. Sorry I missed you. Where are you going? You wouldn't believe me. You haven't from the moment we met. Rachel, I am a firm believer in second chances. Whatever you're thinking about doing, don't. My husband is trying to frame me. And I think I know where he is. R... Rachel? Ra... She hung up on me. Don't worry, we got it. - Let's go. - Okay. Rachel. Thank God you're here. My God, what happened to you? I was kidnapped. Kidnapped? By who? You. Yeah, you tied me up, you beat me. You left me here to die. You're insane. Ever-efficient Rachel. Always does what she's told. I knew everything you were going to do before you did it. All along, the police watching you. The kidnapper at work. And now here you are, just like I planned. It's perfect. You are so predictable. This isn't going to work. It will. I'll escape with my life. After you kill me? You know, I thought about that. But I gotta be honest, I couldn't do it. But get you out of the way? Absolutely. I think a kidnapping conviction should take you out of the loop and away from my daughter, for years. You will never take Ella. Never. How are you going to take care of her from prison? You don't care about her. You dropped us the moment I miscarried. Us? There is no us. I mean, you don't get it. I didn't fall out of love. I was pushed. Like hell you were. I needed your help. I needed you to be there for me. And you blamed me for getting sick, like it was my fault. There isn't a person in this town who doesn't think you aren't guilty. I mean, they all know about you being hospitalized. They know about you being medicated. I mean, hell, I've seen it all on TV. Do you know what it's like for me to be dragged through the mud like that? Even DeeDee, our bitchy neighbor, feels sorry for me. You're the one presumed guilty. You're sick. That's rich. The pot calling the kettle black. You pushed the meds on me the whole time. Maybe I should just kill you. Boy, that would really ruin your plans. Like you said, everyone thinks I'm guilty. Might as well just do it. Yeah. That's not going to happen. Babe. God, this looks great. Always there when I need you. Unlike some people we know. I love him like you never could. Do you really think he's worth all this? Is that what best friends do? Lie, cheat? I trusted you, Jessica. Yeah, well, he trusted you and you ruined his life. But it all worked out for the best, see? Because now we were able to find each other. - We're soul mates. - That's golden. Has he told you about his new baby? - You shut up. - His girlfriend is pregnant. No. He's not with her. He hasn't been with her - since he's been with me. - Really? Because she's four months pregnant. He's gonna be the proud daddy to a baby boy. A boy? Tye. Come on, she's lying, right? You're lying. Come on, Tye! - Tell me that she's lying. - Listen, calm down. - Tell me she is lying. - We're gonna be a family, just like I promised. I swear. Do you really think that you're his only girlfriend? I was so stupid to think that you were just helping out. Instead you screwed my husband and were playing house. He wouldn't stay with you. Shut up. Shut up, shut up. You have lost everything for nothing. Shut up. You shut up! That is not true. She's right, Jessica. Tye. I couldn't stay with you. Get back here! - No! No! - Here! I will shoot you, Tye. Sit down. Put the gun down, Rachel! He set me up! She's crazy. You know that. Shut up! Just lower the gun. I know you've been through a lot. But it doesn't have to end this way. I'm going to holster my weapon and then you're going to hand me yours. Okay? Okay? Come on. Come on, give me the gun. Give me the gun. We're going to figure it out. Give me the gun, Rachel. - Cuff her! - I didn't shoot her! - Get her out of here! - He's lying! He's lying! She's still alive. Call an ambulance! Roper, stop him! Get paramedics in here now! Nice shot. Let her go. She's innocent. Come on, on your feet. I can't believe you would go through all of this just to get rid of your wife. Get him out of my sight. Haven't you heard of a divorce? Look, I owe you a huge apology. Yeah, you and a few other people. Well, let me be the first to say it then. I'm sorry. Did you ever think I was innocent? I hoped you were. I've got to go pick up Ella. Least I can do is give you a ride. I knew it wasn't her. She's a good person, very nice neighbor. We're good friends. She's been through a lot, you know. Poor thing. And for her husband to do this, my heart just breaks for her. It's so sick he's screwing around on her. I know. I knew it. And I feel so badly for his wife now. So do I. Have you seen the new history teacher? - No. - My God. - He's so hot. - Wait, no way. Let's go right now. Come on, I'll show you. He's over on "B" hall. Ooh, that had to hurt. Damn, I'm good. Well, I had doubts about the allegations laid against her right from the start. But I carefully examined all the evidence and I maintained a very studied, very neutral opinion that turned out to be correct in the end. Thank you for everything you've done. You were there when I needed someone. Hey, you mind if I give you a call in a week or two and check in on you? I'd really like that. All right. Take care of that little girl. I will.
