One, two, three... This is perfect. I'll just make a square like this. And then sew it the other way. What? Why are you laughing? Hey, that's easy, too! OK. Do you need music? Sometimes I wonder if you know how that stuff comes across? Seven... That's an ancient Aryan good luck symbol. Do you care about people's feelings? Of course I do. I think I'm a pretty... ..empathetic person. Because, I mean, irrespective of what the political reality is as you see it, as other people see it, there's just a lot of people who... You mean all the Jews that might be really upset at seeing a swastika, so they might be offended... Why does that make you want to cause more offence? I'm not doing it to cause pain to somebody. I find it entertaining to put a swastika on the floor. You told me to do stuff I'd normally have done. When my kids and I go to the beach sometimes we draw swastikas in the sand and you guys aren't around. Gee! I wonder why we do that? Maybe because we think it's a neat-looking symbol. You can't comprehend it. But you know what's funny? I can comprehend how you feel. I can understand. You don't seem to understand how...my way of thinking, but I do understand your way of thinking because I used to be a brainwashed lemming like yourself! No offence. None taken. For several weeks, I'd been living among a community of true believers trying to find the humanity in people whose world view is probably the most abhorrent conceivable. But so far, I wasn't having a very easy time of it. My journey began three weeks earlier in Fulbrook, California, a small town half an hour outside San Diego. I was meeting one of America's most notorious racists. A Grand Dragon of the KKK in the '70s, a congressional candidate in the '80s, and now the leader of White Aryan Resistance - a self-styled revolutionary group. His name - Tom Metzger. FROG CROAKS DOORBELL RINGS Hello. Lou! How are you doing? Good. You must be Tom. What branch of the government are you from? I'm Tom. I'm from the BBC. The broadcasting arm of the government. The heavy duty boys. Come on in. Are you Tom's better half? Yes, I am, actually. Oh, yes. She's my better half. He doesn't admit that too often. I gotta say that. Yes, you do. Do you...? I'm just sort of starting out so I don't really... I'm not familiar with all the terminology and the specifics of your politics and your world view. Are you a Nazi? I think I'm more serious than most of the Nazis I ever met. I'm a pan-Aryanist. I believe in white people all over the world sticking together. Here's the latest paper. The main work you do really is...um... Paper, Internet... WAR - stands for? White Aryan Resistance. What have we got there? Well, this is a typical... white whore and a black guy. What is the problem with a white woman going out with black man? Most black men are ugly, number one. You think you're better looking than Denzel Washington? Yeah. Do you really? Oh, yeah. What if that was put to a vote and you were outvoted? If I had the money and the power and a job making movies, I'd get ten times more women than him. Do you really believe that? That seems delusional. Well, I believe it. I don't know whether it's delusional or not. Denzel Washington's in there because they have to do that... But just on looks, you can't... Denzel... He's not bad looking. He's not as ugly as... Yeah... ..as ugly a nigger as most. Like Colby Bryan. Why did you use that word? I use it all the time. I never used to use it. Would you not use it around me? Not use it? In my home, I'll use it. If you don't want me to say it in a restaurant or out, I won't. But in my home, I'll say what I want. Then it's up to you. That's your right. Right. As a favour to me, though? No. If I decide I want to say "nigger", I'll say it. If I don't want to say it, I won't. That really upsets you, don't it? Mmm... It doesn't really upset me. Well, good. Then we'll go on. It makes me think slightly less of you. That's OK. I'm not here to adopt you. I got a lotta CDs. I don't really like every one of them, but... some of them I haven't even played There's a lot of skinhead music. Is that one? Yeah. That's... ..Hey! Leave it alone. What is the point of having a lynching of a black man on a CD? I think it's conveying a message if a black person is out of line... ..badly...then it's fine. They should be lynched. But we'll probably let the sheriff and the police do it. Don't you think that's quite shocking, Mary? I don't wanna hang one at a time. Are you kidding? That's too slow. We want them all out. Do you really? Of course! We don't need them! They're a pain. They drag us down. But on the other hand they can have their own nation, their own police, their own military. We don't want any part of them. They should be happy. The blacks always say how... Don't you think that's shocking, Mary? To have a picture of a black guy being lynched on a CD? It's part of history. I don't think it's terribly shocking, no. KNOCK AT DOOR I think somebody knocked at the door. Yeah. Who is that? Would that be Lynn? I don't know. She said four... Oh, it is four. Huh! Laurie! Laurie! My long-lost little angel! Who's Laurie? Mary? She's the eldest daughter. OK. Hello, guys. Hello. How do you do? I'm Louis. Nice to meet you. And you. What do you do, Laurie? I work at Starbucks. Do you? And go to school. Do you consider yourself a racist? No. But I think in everyone's own way that everyone is racist because my whole life, you know, all throughout school, kids, white, black, whatever would hate me because... of my last name. Really? Yeah. You pointed at me. No. Well, why would they do that? Not because of you, but because, "Metzger, ooh!" Is your dad Tom? Because they'd heard of Tom Metzger as a leading racist? Even today at work people talk about me. Could you go out with a Jewish guy? I mean, I can. I'm of age. I can do my own choices. Would you worry about what your dad would think? Maybe a little, but...not much. I'm not gonna ask for his approval. That wouldn't make me too happy. I'm not! I know you're not. What would you do, then? I would not have a Jew with my daughter in this house. Period. It...it...speaks of hatred... really. I hate the people who cause me to hate. They kill my friends. They imprison them for life, they...give them many more years than they do the common black negro. They rape and torture people... That is such bull. That is such bull! Don't you read the crime statistics in your country, for Christ's sake? Don't you read what blacks do in England? I do! Excuse me. If I wanted to stay the night at your place... would that be feasible? I don't think I'd like that. Really? I don't feel comfortable with any stranger staying in my home. We can be pals and go out to lunch and have a beer or something. I'll even sing karaoke to you. We can be buddies to that point, but it'd be weird of me to have... a buddy buddy just to be a buddy non-political buddy. Would it? I don't want to do it in a tokenistic way. Well, at this time it would be a very tokenistic way. Really? # Just to be here with you # Just to be here with you # There is nothing that I wouldn't do... # It had been a long and in some ways depressing day. I'd found Tom's attitudes exhausting. And I was still more confused when the karaoke bar he took me to turned out to be largely non-white. I could only assume that, for Tom, karaoke sometimes took precedence over racism. # On the day I was born # The nurses all gathered round... # The next day, and Tom was taking me to meet his recently hired manager - John Malpezzi. John was supposedly a show business veteran with a long list of Hollywood contacts. Exactly why a Nazi needed such a manager was still unclear to me. How do you do? Fine. You must be John. And you must be Louis. Yes. Looking forward to meeting you, Louis. Me too. Thanks. One of the most important things that I do is arranging for his bookings that are outside of the country and that are specialised bookings to put in appearances. We've got a lot of things planned for this year. We've some that are up and coming that you've probably heard of and are invited to. We're looking forward to a busy year of raising his profile internationally even more. Why? Why not? That's his job! That's my job. Has John seen the paper that you put out? Of course. I don't know how much he's read it, but he's seen it. Then again, I don't grab anybody by the lapels including my manager. Right. And remember, I'm an adult guy that's been around a long time. Would it be appropriate to, um... show you the paper...? If you're gonna read... If you're gonna read a striking, er... Louis, Louis! ..you know... on fire type of stuff, and ask, "Do you agree with this?", I don't want to go there because that's not what this is about. Other people I've known, if you pulled that on them in a plane, would throw you out the plane. With a... If I did what? If I did what, John? Well... Let's continue. OK? OK. I like this guy. He is good. Hey, Tom. I hope you sang Louis Louis at the karaoke. Louis Louis. It was all a little bit weird and I still didn't understand how exactly John and Tom fit together. John had had a colourful career prior to working with Tom. Would that explain their relationship? Back at John's house, I seized my moment to ask. Was there some...? You had some sort of a run-in with the authorities and, er... Wait a minute! What is this? What? Did you tell him? You told him, didn't you? Didn't you spend time in prison, John? Sure, why not? It's all public. He's on the run. What was it? What happened? Don't tell anybody. I'm on the run - openly. I'd rather not discuss that. Come on. You can't talk about that? Let me put it to you this way - I represented a lot of... Come on. I'll show you the view, boys. I represented a lot of large clients, like Pablo Escobar and guys like that. You were some kind of cocaine... big kingpin cocaine dealer? Me? Little old me? Seriously? Everybody needs an attorney, even guys like Pablo Escobar. This is the view. How long did you get? How long was your sentence? Well, I was looking at 85 years... and, er, which, at that age, would have meant a life sentence. And, er... we beat it, actually, and wound up doing three and a half. And I'm not ashamed to say that. What was the conviction? Um...cocaine trafficking and related charges. Today...today, folks, I'm not into that business. You have to move on, you know. So, um, I do other things. How long have the two of you been in business together? Well, we've known each other some time, several years, but we've not been in business together long. I'd say about a year or so. Yeah. A couple of months, you said. Well, you see it crosses over from friendship to business and it gets a little blurry. Yeah. I know you like to stay with people, you're a nice guy. Tom's house is his house. My mother is back from the hospital in the next day or two. If you're still around, you know, it'd be my pleasure to host you, Louis. I like you. Really? I like you as a person and I don't think you're as sneaky as you think you are. You're a real nice guy. So, other questions... Would that be OK with you Tom? I don't care. John is his own man. All my people are that way. They do what they do. We were hoping to stay with you. No, that's not going to happen. Have you been thinking about it? No. No. Wouldn't even consider it. Remember, Louis, every guy that I ever got... 'Who John was and how much of what he said I could believe was still all rather vague to me 'and possibly to him too. It seemed clear Tom trusted him and I was intrigued by their relationship.' Some days later, Tom was to speak at a skinhead rally. For him to make a public appearance was rare. Usually he confined himself to his Internet chatroom and phonelines. I was curious to meet a few of his supporters face to face, so a few days before the big event I decided to visit one of the organisers. A skinhead named Skip. How are you doing? Good. Shall we come in? Come aboard. PUNK MUSIC PLAYS Skip, I'm Louis. I know. Good morning. How're you doing? Good. Got a little cut. What happened? A little cut at work. Went right through the lip. Ouch! Not good. Introduce us to your family, will you? Hi, folks. How are you? Come and meet the family. Come on. This is my youngest, Cydne. This is number two, Rhiannon. Hi, Rhiannon. And this is number one, Kernie. Hi, Kernie. My lovely wife, Heather. Hi. My baby brother, Lenny. Lenny. Lenny. Loony. Lenny. Yeah. BABY brother. Yeah. Good stuff. Yeah, good stuff. Welcome to paradise. Yeah. So this is where you live? This is where it all happens. It's where the magic happens. Watch these cats don't run out. We're going in. This is a regular house. It don't look nothing like the garage because I'm a...you know... I am responsible, too. Yeah. This is our kitchen. You are a...would you call yourself a skinhead? You bet! Yeah. Since '83. You know we've been making a documentary about Tom Metzger. Do you regard him...? How do you view him? As a good man. A good patriot. He's done a lot for a long time. Done a lot of good for the young guys. I've been following him since '83. Every move, all skinheads. He's done a lot of good. Yeah. He's a good patriot. Would you consider yourself white racist, too? Yeah. Definitely. And Nancy? We're not big conversationalists. Yeah. She seemed on the fence with that. You seemed on the fence there. On the fence? Yeah. I think you're on the fence. Yeah. Yeah. I'm on the me... I'm the media. I don't come... I'm not disguising... That's like an insult to say someone's on the fence. Really? Yeah. Why? They're not in our group properly. Get off the fence. Pick a side. Be there. I didn't mean to insult you, Nancy. I apologise. If I told you I was Jewish, would that create a problem between us? Because you've got the camera right now, I'd allow you to stay, if not, I'd probably kick your ass and put you in the street. For real? Pretty much, because a Jew wouldn't be here on my property. Are you Jewish? Do you mind if I don't answer that? If you weren't on camera - are you? LAUGHTER That's not... I'm not saying yes or no. So you're on the fence? LAUGHTER You're on the fence. I'll tell you why... I'm not a racist. I actually think it's wrong to be a racist and so I feel as though by, um... saying whether I'm Jewish or not, I'm kind of in a way acknowledging the premise that it matters when I think it shouldn't and it doesn't. We're leaving these ones alone. We don't need this much water. I wasn't sure how long I'd be welcome at the house. But I thought I'd enjoy it while it lasted. As the afternoon passed, I could have almost have convinced myself I was feeling relaxed. But something was still bothering Skip. How about that? Louis's a Jew. We know it. You're a Jew. That's why you got so much animosity. You don't look like a Jew. You're a Jew. You're part Jewish. Don't say, "I'm not", because you think somebody'll beat you up. We're not like that. Why will it make any difference to you whether I am or not? I like to know who's been in my house. We don't care if you're a Jew, Christian, a fucking Spic, or whatever nigger... You look kinda Jewish. You got an accent like these lads. He's not Jewish. Look at his face - you know he's not Jewish. But, you, frankly, we look at your face... We want to know if you're a fucking Jew? And if we'd let you into our house to film our everyday ritual. Are you a fucking Jew? Maybe you disagree - I don't feel as though I've compelled you to say anything, I feel I've been respectful... You have! I appreciate... I'm not debating the fact you've been respectful to my house. I wouldn't interrogate you to the point where if you said, "I don't want to talk about that," I'd say, "That's fine." I'd like you to respect me in the same way. Turn the camera off for a second. Pull plug. Pull the plug for a second. What for? We're not crazy. No, no, it's fine. Are you part-Jew? To free talk to not feel like we're being filmed. I'd really rather not say. I'd really rather you tell me. I've exposed myself, I've exposed my family, I've exposed my brothers, my sisters, and my children, expose yourself now. I'll... Can I speak to you? Let's leave it at that, please, Skip? Let's go inside. Go inside. 'I thought it was time to leave.' It was the day of the skinhead rally and I was back at Tom's. Nice to see you today. Good. You look nice. Thank you. So do you. Tom is getting the final objects together. Loading the car. The final what together? Objects. Stuff. Are you in there, Tom? Yo, yo, yo! Are you ready to go to the "hatenanny"? Huh? Is that what they call it? The "hatenanny". 'With a certain amount of trepidation, I was going to Skip's for a white power music event, 'at which Tom would be the keynote speaker. 'I still hadn't seen Tom among fellow racists and I was curious how he would be received.' Is this it? Second house on the left. Yeah, this is it. Hi. How're you doing? Tom Metzger for Tommy Romero. You got a walkie-talkie? No. Where do I park? Pull down the back. OK. Tom had told me he speaks at one or two rallies a year, and by skinhead standards, this was a major event. Search you. Turn around. You want to take a picture of me? With me? Sure. Thank you. I was hoping Tom would be my guide through what promised to be for me a pretty strange experience. But with the public to meet, Tom no longer seemed to view me as a top priority. As a member of the supposedly Jewish-run media, I suspected he felt my presence embarrassing. Good turnout? Yeah. That's good. Any of you guys want to talk about Tom for the documentary? What's that? Any of you guys want to talk about Tom for the documentary? I gotta go back here. I felt like the schoolkid no-one wanted to be friends with. And then the next act came on stage. GUITAR INTRO TO: "The Road To Valhalla" # He raised high his sword # As he cried out Valhalla... # This was the first time I saw the singing duo - Lamb and Lynx. # The journey has finally come to an end for the boy # And he has risen as the bravest of them all. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Can you hear me out there? CROWD: Yeah! Here's Tom! I'll start you out, OK? Nigger, nigger, nigger! Out! Out! Out! Nigger, nigger, nigger! Out! Out! Out! This is revolution! Revolution! CROWD: Yeah! Revolution! Just keep your powder dry, boys. Don't waste yourself. Don't jump too soon. Just wait! Wait till they come out. Let 'em get right out there. Oh, boy! I can hardly wait. I've always said I wouldn't leave California cos this will be the start of the second American Civil War! Right here in California! White revolution! White revolution! White revolution! Thank you. Thank you. DOG BARKS Ssh! Ssh! Come on in. Thank you. I'm eating my morning Popsicles. Do you like Popsicles? I do. How're you doing? A little tired, but I'm OK. Is that a morning-after feeling? A little bit, but I got in early. How late did you stay there? We left about nine, I guess. Have a Popsicle. Everybody needs a Popsicle. Is Mary around? Mary fled the scene. She says... IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: "I can't take it any more!" Did she? No. She had things to do. I usually don't drag her out all over the country too much. Did she enjoy it? Yeah. Shall we go outside for a bit? It's very nice out. I have to put my shoes on. What is it you like about the skinheads? I like them cos they're not hypocritical. They're out in the open. They are what they are. They don't give a damn what anybody thinks. They are strong racist and we need them. Don't they turn off a lot of the public? A lot of the public doesn't mean a damn to us. You realise we're not trying to recruit the general public. What would we do with them if we had them? They sit on their ass watching television 20 hours a day, they're feeding their mouth full of crap. All they want to do is go out and buy. What good would they be to us? We're talking about revolutionary activity. We want the leaders out there in the public, but not the public. We're trying to reach those people out there that know what's cooking. I sensed Tom and I needed a break from each other and so I decided to drive up to central California to meet the two girls I'd seen at the rally, Lamb and Lynx, and their manager and mother, April. DOORBELL RINGS Hello. Hello. You must be April? Yes. Nice to see you again. Do you remember we met at the rally? Yes, I do. Shall we come in? Which one's Lynx and which one's Lamb? I'm Lamb. Hi. The one back there's Lynx. Hello. And I'm Louis. Very pleased to meet you. Remember him from Saturday? Maybe we can do a recital later. Yeah. I think that would be good. # Oh, when they tell you about South Africa # And the so-called fight for freedom # And the much-praised black resistance # And the Communists who lead them # Not too far away in Angola and near our own Zimbabwe # The Marxist black dictators # Are looking south and fair to say # Strike force white survival # Strike force, yeah # Strike force gonna kill our rivals # Strike force into the devil's lair. # Do they...? They don't seem old enough to know what that's about. Well, I've explained it. What's the ANC? It's, um... African... National... S... African National... Com... Congress. Congress. OK. What happened in South Africa? The... The blacks are killing whites. Yeah. Out of the homes. Out of the homes. And in Zimbabwe... Yeah, and in Zabwe. Bimzabwe. Zimbabwe. They seem a little young to get into politics and racial issues. Yes, but they gotta start some time. How old are they? Eleven. Eleven? What is the idea behind creating this group out of them that sings? I think that Lamb and Lynx's music and their appeal as they get a bit older, they're going to be an example and they're going to show how being proud of your race is something that would be very appealing to young teenage girls, you know? What young man, red-blooded, American boy isn't going to find blonde twins, 16-years-old singing about white pride and pride in your race... who...very few are not going to find that very appealing. So what, um... I'm curious about how... What school do they go to? What school do you go to? Home school. Who teaches you? My momma. Mom. There we go. OK. Who wants what? Polony, ham or salami? So where is the... Is there a man of the house? April? Yeah. There's my fiance. And he declined to be shown on camera because of his occupation. He's worried... We have the same belief system and he's very supportive of everything, but he... Actually, he'd love to appear, but he worries that it'd cause him to lose his job. What does he do? He's an educator. Would you like tomato? Tomato with it too? Are there things that are forbidden that other kids have...? Things that you deny them? Game Boys. Yeah, I'm not much for the Nintendo... People... ..computer games. What about on racial terms? We've got Ethnic Cleansing, but we don't play that often. What's that? That's a computer game that the National Alliance puts out called Ethnic Cleansing. It's basically a shoot-'em-up computer game, in which a skinhead goes through a ghetto and shoots blacks and Mexicans. Do you like it? Mm-hm. It's really hard though, cos of course all the people that you shoot have guns, too. They hide in bushes and stuff. They're like perched up on basketball hoops and stuff, and climbing in trees and stuff, so you gotta watch out and when you hear a gorilla sound, "Oo-oo-oo!" you go, "Woo!", then you shoot it. Is that a good idea, April? It seems a little... Vulgar? OK. After lunch, Lamb and Lynx were keen to show me their horses stabled a short drive away. Today's one of the... There's a school bus. Do you ever wish you went to school with the other kids? Mmm. Mmm. Sometimes. Sometimes. But then I think that I won't be able to go with my horse. And that we wouldn't be able to see our mom as much. And so we're good. What did you say, "You wouldn't be able to go with your horse?" Yes. Why? Play with my horse. I wouldn't, in the evenings. She's really attached to her horse. Is that the skinhead music? Who's it by? It's Max Resist, but I think it's a cover by somebody else, like Landser. 'To all the white nationalists all around the world, 'united we will win.' HEAVY GUITAR MUSIC STARTS # White boy # They call me Nazi and I'm proud of that # They call me racist and I shout it out loud # Proud of my race and proud of my land # White brothers and sisters Come raise your hand # We're an 88 rock and roll band We're an 88 rock and roll band # We're an 88 rock and roll band playing, fighting for race and land # We are marching on the streets at night, boots and braces We are ready to fight # Out, gook, out Run, nigger, run # We're Aryans Understand you're done! # We're an 88 rock and roll band playing and fighting for race and land. # If anybody asks out here why we've got a cameraman following us around, we'll say that you're interviewing us about the kids' music. Why is that, um...? I just don't want somebody messing with my horses and hurting my horses because of my politics. I don't know what they're going to do out here. Do you have to lead a double life? I never had to before because I've never been in the situation I'm in. It's really hard for me to be covert because I'm just so... It's just like so much... It's like in every pore, you know. I've noticed. Can I help? Can I take the rag and do a bit? If you want to. What do I do? You can wipe them down. Is this just water? Just water. Just cleaning their nostrils. Oh. Cleaning their nostrils. HORSES NEIGH Are they talking to each other? You can give them a brush. Would you have a problem if Lynx or Lamb brought home a friend of another race? Yeah. I probably wouldn't be real happy about it. What would you do? I would probably tell them not to. I would probably tell them, you know, "If that's what you're going to do, don't bring them home." I would see it, first, it's the friend. It's OK to have the nice black friend and then it's the black boyfriend. You'd have a problem with that? I would never speak to them again. That would be it. If they were race traitors, then I wouldn't... absolutely...I wouldn't want to have anything to do with them ever again. And I told them that. I consider... That's easy to say, but the maternal instinct's gotta be one of the strongest instincts. You're saying you would completely go against that? Have no contact with your child? I would be so disappointed. I would just be so disappointed. SHE CLICKS AT HORSE Come on. Come on, Becky. HORSE NEIGHS 'I couldn't quite believe the almost reckless intensity of April's racism. 'She seemed to revel in how outrageous her beliefs were. 'I wondered how Lynx and Lamb would feel about their mother once they could think for themselves.' Later that day, we headed off to meet April's father. 'I'd heard he was also a racist and was hoping he'd help me understand how April came by her beliefs.' How do you do? Hello. Louis Theroux. BBC. Nice to meet you. You must be April's father. Yeah. This is my Dad - Bill Gaede. Bill Gaede? Yeah. Can we...? I noticed you had a... Can we look at your cattle brand? The ranch logo? I'm not sure what the right expression is. It's the cattle brand. How do you view Aprils's beliefs as far as preserving... the white race...? I think it's great. You gotta preserve it. Doesn't it...? Our family were Vikings in Denmark in the 12th century. Why not preserve it? It seems to me it's gonna preserve itself just fine and there's no need for any radical action as far as laws and campaigns... You're sitting under a manhole cover. You can't see anything. Why is that? You just can't see it cos you're not here. All the people are so politically correct, they wouldn't say shit if they had a mouth full of it. You know. But now the people are beginning to see what's going on and their backbone's beginning to straighten up a bit. All the white people are. I'm a multiculturist. Are you? Yeah. When you get married, will you marry a white or a nigger? Huh? What do you usually date? Do you usually date white women? So far... That's what you find attractive. Does Jewish count as white? No. Not in our books. > Why not? I think we should hope that he marries some Jewess. Won't that be funny? A Jap? A Jewish American Princess. Boy! She's gonna have... She's gonna have you right there! What's your name? Louis. HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Louis! Louis, I want a ring, Louis! Bring me my coffee...my tea, Louis! Come and flush the toilet for me, Louis. I can't put the handle down. So is that where you get it from, do you think, April? The biggest gift that I got from my father was to not give a rip about what anybody else thought. It's what you thought. It's what you really knew in your heart was the right thing to do. It didn't matter if every single person was against you. If you know what you believe is right, and you can have the strength to stand strong against everyone. I believe I inherited that. I think in the genes and then I was taught that also. I owe my dad a lot for giving me that. That was a gift. Back in Fulbrook, and I had a date with Tom. There was a plan in place to meet another of his daughters named Lynn. Before that, a barbecue. Good afternoon. Hello, Louis. You feel at home? Very much so. Look at you wearing a bowler hat. Yeah! Do you like that? It's good. Come on in. Is that in honour of me? Yeah, right. A little bottle of something. You should have brought two or three, but that's all right. I got one in the car if we run low. So the plan is to have a barbecue, is that right? Yeah. Just keep it real simple and real easy. Yeah. That's how I like it. Hi, John. How are you doing? Fine. ..Mary, good to see you again. Good to see you, John. And you... Oh! The camera's on! I brought something for Louis! Back, Louis, back! Back, Louis, back! John. What does it mean? This cross came from the movie, Scream, Dracula, Scream. I definitely saw that. Right. It's a prop. You haven't met Laurie before, John? No. They've kept me in a cage whenever she's around. I gotta watch him when it comes to young girls. No, I've heard John prefers Mexican women. Where's that cross again? Back, Louis, back! It didn't work in the movies, so... Yeah. I got the pork especially for you to check you out. They're turkey. You read the label. I told Mary I was going to do that. Do you care if I'm Jewish? Not for this, no. What about for something else? You're just doing your job. That's the way it goes. Sometimes there's neutral territory. I wonder if you could give me a hand. I don't really know what I'm doing. You said you wanted to help cook. Yeah. Well, we gotta turn down... That's on too hot, isn't it? It's too hot. Shall we invite the neighbours over? I think the neighbours went to TJ. Who have you got on that side? That's a white guy, he's married to a Mexican gal. She's an American-type Mexican. They got a couple of kids. Do you get on OK with them? We get along OK. Is she white? No, she's not. But she's friendly. We don't have a problem. I hope you like your hot dogs well done. That's well done enough. Man, you have screwed my hot dog up. I think it's a Polish sausage. Let me get that! Ah! Do you want me to put another one on? No, that's OK. That's edible. Then it was off to see Tom's daughter, Lynn, and her daughter, Valerie, who is 11 years old. I'd heard Lynn was the most racist of Tom's five daughters, so I was curious to meet her. Ah! Maybe the wrong place. I got the wrong place. Hey! Hey! I saw you guys walk a mile, I was like, "Where are you going?!" You know me. I know, I know. A bunch of Communist places - they all look alike. They all do. Hello. Hello. Simon? Louis. Louis. This is Louis. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. This is Valerie. How do you do? Louis's the star. Star, huh? Don't forget it! We won't! Come on in. Tom said you used to run the Aryan Women's League. I did. I did. It was running for... Thank you. ..about, I guess, five, six years. And we decided to merge with WAR. We were doing the same thing. WAR is Tom's organisation. Exactly. Do you have the same racial views Tom does? I do. I'm not one of these labels... Yeah. ..type of people. Nazi, left, right, Democrat, Republican, pacifist, whatever. I don't like that. I do have a strong sense of racial identity. A strong sense of nature, believing in nature, etc, and... but I don't like labels. I don't even like to hear 'em cos they don't mean anything. Are you comfortable Sieg Heiling, for example? I'm comfortable with it. Yeah. It's not something I do often. In fact, last night, I did and that was the first time in a long time. What's... Is Valerie comfortable on camera or is she hanging back? I asked her and she said in the background would be fine. Not talking to her. She's 11 years old, she's big for her age, but she's, you know... she's a really good kid. Are you... I mean, are you bringing her up as a racist? Bringing her up as a racist. I'm bringing her up very aware of her heritage, very aware of what's going on. I've often told her I have opinions, I have beliefs, and just like my dad did when I was a kid, I told her that she needs to explore, she needs to know what's out there. She can't just take what I say. Would she... Would you be happy for her to bring children, friends of other races back to the house? No. I wouldn't be happy. Honestly... I mean, she's going to... What I believe is that she's going to learn from me and my actions and my words and my thoughts when I put them into actions. So we'll just see what happens. I was nearing the end of my time with Tom and for some days John had been talking about going to Mexico. His exact purpose was unclear, but I thought it might be a chance to see Tom in a different environment and so I thought I'd tag along. DOG BARKS Louis! Hi! Hey, John. How are you doing? You're going to love it! Let's get ready to go. Where's Tom? He's waiting for us. Where? At his house. Great. Oh, let's go! Let me get it going. I've got it all prepared. I've got... Louis, what do you think? Will I be too warm today dressed like this? I look like a tourist which is what I want to look like. Instead of a slick guy like you that I should be looking like. Why are we interested in seeing Tom in Mexico? You're going to love to see Tom in Mexico. Why? Well, you're going to see what an international politician does. These are my medicines here. He's a racist politician so I suppose it's interesting to see him among... In a racist country. They will respect him. Oh, they're racist down there. You didn't know that? Follow me! Hey, Louis. He's afraid of getting kidnapped. No! He is. Every time he goes to Mexico they try to kidnap him. So we'll be in your car? No, we'll be in your car. What is the plan when we get there? Why don't you tell him the truth? You just want to get to that whore! That's what you're really saying. I wouldn't refer to a lovely lady like that as a whore. Well, if you pay money, she's a whore. Esta Montserrat? Allo. Did I send this? It says "send". Sorry. Dialling. Jesus Christ! Voy a Tijuana con un cliente - una estrella de cine de America y una televisua... That's a mouthful! BOTH: We're in! We're in! Right lane! Right lane! Why are you getting in the middle lane? Downtown! Go to the left. Left lane, Louis. You got more back-seat drivers than you ever had! Right turn here. I was still curious what form Tom's ambassadorial trip would take and was surprised when John began directing me to Tijuana's tourist bars. I want a sombrero. I wanna buy... They're down there, those shops. Let's go. Let's have a drink first. Let's get a drink first. The drinks are there too. Montserrat! Is that her? Does she recognise you? Montserrat. Soy yo! Guapin! Oh! Aloha! Como estas? Bien, bien, mi amor. Es tu amigo? Hola. Hello, I'm Louis. Es Louis. Un guy como... What's his name? Geraldo Rivera... ..de Inglaterra. Esto es mi cliente. Hi. Hola. Tom Metzger, un estrella de cine en Los Estados Unidos y aqui es el crew. Toma sita, mi amor. Montserrat and I are going to get married one day. Wow! Vamos a casar un buen dia! Da-da-da! Can we say what it's about? No. Why not? Because I don't want to... Who knows what her politics or her...or her... celebrity things are. She's my girl and she'll be showing us around. You got a documentary following you? Yeah. Where are you from? Sacramento. I was the head of the KKK in California. No shit? Yes! And now... What happened? Did you get kicked out? No. I quit. You're a skinhead now, I see. I'm skinhead. You guys need me in Sacramento. It's a fucked-up place. It's all fucked up. You got Schwarzenegger. He's gonna terminate... The black nigger. He's gonna terminate the state. You think he's going to save us? Bullshit! You sound like a racist to me. I am a racist. What you talking about? I'm not a racist. Don't you want your grandchildren to look like you? I don't give a shit how they look! Oh, man! You're killing me! One dollar. It's one dollar, Tom. Give 'em a dollar as a tip. Buy me a beer, too. Good choice, Tom. # Ba ba bamba ba ba bamba... # Come on, sing! # Ba ba bamba... # The ambassadorial visit was degenerating into a pub crawl. It had all become rather chaotic. Do I need another hat? Rings. Swastika. I need a bigger hat... is what I need. No swastika? She might have it in this store. Do you have any swastika rings? Swastika. Where's Tom? Where's Tom gone? Several tequilas later, we lost Tom in a souvenir shop somewhere. When he resurfaced, he seemed even more drunk. He was concerned he could have been attacked or kidnapped and accused John of neglecting security duties. I don't depend on anybody who runs any town, I depend on my security. And when I walk out of a place and my security is not there... Well, did Louis leave you? You don't seem to understand, John. What I'm trying to tell you is there is certain towns that are run a certain way and I am totally wired in here. I don't give a shit how you're wired in. I'm wired into my own people. I don't trust anybody else, nobody you know. I trust my friends. My security next time comes with me. If I can walk around... My friends are concerned about my security. If I can walk around with a fucking hat on my head like a clown... Your brain's full of pussy. That's all you're thinking about. You think I'm not a racist. No, you're not a racist like I am. I'm gonna make a bet. I'm gonna put my dollar down. He would fuck Montserrat and I wouldn't. Why? She's not white. I gotta go pee. The day was ending and I reflected on Tom's fears of being kidnapped. I felt this was Tom at his most unguarded. What struck me was Tom's fantasies of his own importance. On the way home, John made a last attempt to salvage something from the international trip. Tom, tell us about Mexico, OK. What do you think about it? I think it's a very interesting place to visit. And I think a lot of Aryans should go there, and carve out something like a country. And that might be something I was thinking about. You know what? That's exactly what we're all thinking about. When I saw how well you could get on up there, Tom. It made me think, "Well, maybe... "Maybe you should abandon racism." Maybe you'd find that you didn't really... It wasn't something you needed any more. TOM LAUGHS Let me answer that. You don't understand. Right. Tom is actually... You don't understand, Louis. It's like... Go through the next gap. Go up the hill, up the hill. Here's what we're going to say. TOM MUTTERS He doesn't because... Because the Mexican guys... Let Tom answer, John. No, I don't want him to answer right now because it's been a long day and my client is tired. He's tired. He's relaxing now, please. Mary. Hi, dear. We've got one rather drunken gentleman with us. 'It was all far from the statesman visit that John had advertised. 'I had to keep reminding myself Tom was supposed to be one of the most dangerous racists in America.' It was my last day with Tom. I had been badgering him for a chance to see him at his day job. Stay here. Stay! G'morning! Good morning. Hello there. Friend or foe? We haven't worked that out yet! OK. Stay here, boy. That's a work in progress. I gotta keep my bandit dog in there. He's so used to running in the car that sometimes I have to leave him. Tom's a TV repair man. And today he was picking up a TV from one of his most faithful clients. Do you want a hand with that, Tom? Sure. I got to open up the back door. Is it your TV? Yes. What's the problem? Er, it doesn't work too good. Yeah. I have known Tommy for many years. Have you? Oh, yes. And, er, I have not found in Fulbrook or in LA where I lived many years... Yeah. ..a man that honest. You like him? Oh, I like him very much. When I'm not here I leave my key, that much I trust him. Do you know about his politics? Yes. We don't argue about politics. I know him as a man. He's got his ideas. And I have mine. Yeah. It does not interfere. He's a friend of mine for a long time. How about that? What's your...? You sound like you got a slight accent. Where're you from originally? Peru. From Peru? Yes. Peruvian. Yeah. I never ask you that myself. That's true. And your name is...? Oscar. Oscar. And, of course, when his wife was alive, I... We used to... We used to live in the big house. That's right. They used to live in a house over here on the other side. Oscar was just saying that as far as politics...you agree not to talk about it. Right. That's right. That's absolutely right. I respect all the people's ideas. Are you all right with that, Tom? I'll get the other side. No. Oscar believes in free speech. Do you know how much he's going to charge? I don't care about that. He knows I'll never cheat him. He's the honest guy and the best technician. Would you consider Tom a friend? Yes. Absolutely. No hesitation. Yeah. And you'd consider Oscar a friend? I believe so. Yes. Sure. We've had a long association. Longer than my girlfriend. I've only known her ten years. Don't tell Mary that. You're one of the most famous racists in America. Yeah. Maybe THE most famous and, er, and there you were saying you were friends with this guy who looked to me non-white or mixed race and it just seemed inconsistent. I thought that was kind of weird. Maybe you need to be educated in the ways of the world. How do you mean? Don't you see that as inconsistent? That you would say you had a friend and it's this guy who looks like he was mixed race? Louis... Louis's hanging on this friend thing - a very abstract word. I would not debate the term "friend" on the man's doorstep. Yeah. You and I can debate it. I don't want to hurt the man's feelings. There's more to it, Tom. I felt warmth between you. That's just an association that you know these people. And common courtesy and politeness. Do you really not see what I'm trying to say? I see what you're trying to say but your brain is twisted. I think your brain is twisted. We agree. We both agree that we believe each other's brain is twisted. The facts are on my side. And your brain is gonna stay twisted. You have friends who are non-white and you pal around with non-whites and you're living a happy life... I have people... ..in a gorgeous multicultural community. Whoa! Then you keep pretending... Whoa! ..that you're a revolutionary, but your existence undermines it. Doesn't that fit your package? It's the truth, though. It is the truth. This is really funny. Your day-to-day life is a standing refutation of everything you profess to believe. It is not. It is! Follow me to a hostile meeting. They'll be trying to kill me and I may have to try and kill them. I think you're a hypocrite. OK. All right. So what? I know what I am. I don't need Louis Theroux to quantify what I am. As abhorrent as his views were it was hard to take Tom seriously. He seemed to like being seen as dangerous and also enjoy the fruits of a multiracial democracy. I felt there was a touch of karaoke about this supposed international politician. I was still puzzled by John though. I thought I'd pay one last visit to see if I could pin him down. We'll look at the cartoons. OK. "How far will niggers go to compound the misery of an unfortunate situation? "How about looting during a major hurricane?" How do you react to that? I don't have any reaction at all. I just smoked a cigarette. My mouth is a little dry. Can I go over to the hose and get water? Yeah. Let's go. Do you want to stop doing this, John? No, no, no. I wanna answer your question because it's... I mean this is the message that your... This is what a manager does. This is what an agent or a manager does. Oh! Cigarettes! Yuck! Because this is the message you're promoting. So how is this gonna come out? Are you gonna say that I'm an asshole because of this magazine? I could say that to your face. This is my client's magazine. A manager that is working for their client is working for their client. A lawyer that is representing... I think you know that this stuff is obscene and that's why... It's not obscene. I can see the way you talk about it. You have a sense of guilt. I honestly can. I think that's... I think that's why your mouth went dry. Gosh! I love you so much. I know you kind of have a sense of guilt about it. I can tell. You know I have a sense of guilt? Well, let me tell you something. There is no sense of guilt. There is... ..a representative's duty. I think you're doing it because you had a few bad breaks. You had your problem with drugs... No, no, no! So you can't get other clients, so that's why you represent... Let's deal with this like this. You haven't got other options. Let me answer your question. A few bad breaks. When I went to prison it was the best thing that ever happened to me. You know why? It taught me what's really going on. Do you think this is the truth - what's in this paper? He's appealing as any political figure to a broad base of many dimensions of people and he's got skinheads, he's got this and that, democratic populists... I give up. Every time I ask a question you go on to a... I'm telling you what the truth is. I asked a simple question and you won't answer it. I'm answering it. Do you think what's in this paper is the truth? What this paper is... You're not... Just... What this paper is... Is... Just say no! ..some very hardcore opinions... Why don't you say no? Cos that would not be the truth. Is it wrong or right? Does this paper tell the truth? Or is it a pack of racist lies? The paper tells the truth and it tells the truth in a way that appeals to a certain dimension of his readership. Do you think this tells the truth? You really think this tells the truth? Tom Metzger always tells the truth. Ah! So? I was heading back to see April and the twins. I'd heard that April had booked a studio for Lamb and Lynx to record tracks for their debut album to be titled Fragment Of The Future. This would be my last day among the Nazis and the final chance to challenge April on her indoctrination of her daughters. My sticker's too close. Would you like to be skinheads when you grow up? No! Why not? Because... You have to shave your head a weird way. I'm keeping my hair long. It's not skinhead - it's skinbird. That's a female skinhead. Would you like to go out with skinheads when you're older? Yeah. Sure. Would you? Yes. Why? BOTH: Because... I would. It's cool. They're special people. What did you say, Lynx? They're very special people. They're important people. Why are they important? Because they're very dedicated to what they believe in. Would you mind that, April? Would you be cool with that? With them dating a skinhead? Yes. And maybe getting married? Yeah. If he was a good, hard worker and he wasn't spending his time boozing it up and causing trouble. I don't know many very well, but they seem kind of antisocial... some of them. To me, they're not. To me and the girls they're so protective and polite, ultra, ultra polite to us everywhere we go. Whenever we go to concerts or meetings or anything they bend over backwards. To me they seem kind of angry and sociopathic. They just don't seem that way to me. When you see 'em... Maybe you're so freaked out when you see people salute. Maybe that's why. Maybe I'm just not meeting any of the really good ones. Maybe. The marriage material. Hate for hate... Ruth for ruth... Eye for eye... And tooth for tooth... Scorn for scorn... And smile for smile... Love for love... And guile for guile... War for war... And woe for woe... Blood for blood... And blow for blow. That's pretty. Nah, nah. So do you think you'll go to school one day? Maybe next year when we're ready, but right now... Mom says in a year or two. Maybe. Would you like to? Yeah. It'd be OK. I think it'd be fun. And do you know why she doesn't want you to go to school? Um, yeah. One of the things is because we're having a little bit of money problems. And we need new clothes. Like school clothes. I didn't realise you had to wear special clothes for school. I thought your mum didn't agree with what they were teaching. Also that. She wants us to go to high school. But we may not go. Why would you like to go to school? What is it about school you'd like? You'd get a lot of friends. It's kind of boring just sitting home all day and all your friends are at school. And you've got to wait for them. Wait till they get home. It's new, dudes! Shit! This is not the way you treat a book. Especially one as nice as this. Back at the house and Lamb and Lynx were due to go to a school carnival with some friends. MUSIC STARTS April had told me that Lamb and Lynx's friends don't know they're being raised as racists and I wondered how this double life would affect them in the long term. I knew it was hopeless, but I thought I'd try and talk to April. OK. You guys are going now? Are you going? Yes. It's been a pleasure working with you. Don't... Have a nice time at the carnival. Thank you. You should give Louis a hug. Goodbye. Bye, Shaggy! Bye! Bye, Shaggy! Have a nice time at the carnival. No, no, no, I don't like the milk in it. Have you thought about the implications of indoctrinating Lynx and Lamb in this way? Of course I have. Have you had second thoughts or misgivings of any kind? I don't want to teach them to be politically correct because that's the easy way. I understand. I don't think... It's not the easy way. It's not a choice between... The choice you face is really to bring them up... judging people fairly or not. That's kind of what you want to think about. I don't understand how I'm not doing that. You're... A person... I don't have kids so I don't know. A person who tells their children that all people are created equal and men and woman are equal, in my mind they're lying to their children. They're blatantly lying. Do you realise what a handicap that will be for them in life? No. It won't be. They'll be going through life with this... this dual mindset. Which is what their mum's told them... They shouldn't have to go through... How normal people conduct themselves. I believe that... we're normal and that we're correct and that other people are distorted. So, yes, I understand that I'm raising my children in a perverted world. In a perverted multiculturist world. I'm teaching... I have to teach my children the truth, despite the fact that that's a dangerous thing to be teaching them. I'm doing something that is very dangerous, but I could not live with myself if I were to tell them anything different because it would be a lie. I think what it's about is judging people based on who they are, not your prejudice about who they are, giving people a chance. I find other races annoying. They bother me. I find them annoying. I don't like their chattering in other languages. I don't like the way they look. You know... I mean, 99% of them, I just find the way that they look just really...they're not pretty. They're not attractive to me. I don't want to be around them. I don't like the way they act, the way their children behave... They deal with situations. I don't like the fact they seem to make everything messy wherever they are. I don't like that. I want to be around all white people. But it's like... I'm not being facetious, but have you ever thought about getting therapy or something like that? Because what you have is almost like a pathological... Have you ever thought about getting therapy and seeing how brainwashed you are by multiculturism? I feel like I'm pretty well connected to reality. Well, see I feel that I am, too. It... But you're outvoted. Huh? You're outvoted. What? Here? In civilised thought, basically. My journey through the world of Nazis had reached a frustrating conclusion - with an argument in a kitchen with a mother of two. I seemed to have made no impact on April during my time with her and I had to keep reminding myself just how anomalous her beliefs are. Somehow that wasn't much consolation when the ones who'd pay the consequences were her children - Lamb and Lynx. See you later. Bye. Did I ever tell you the thing about... ..about Denzel Washington? What about him? That Tom said. What did he say? He said that, um... he thinks he's better looking than Denzel Washington. I think Tom is too. We're gonna make a mug out of Tom's head. I wanna trademark his head. The beautiful head. You would drink out of here? Uh... Yeah. THEY LAUGH You wouldn't enjoy a drink out of that. I sure would! Oh, yeah, man. People like mugs. They love mugs. His head would make a good mug. Oh, yeah. Oh, Louis.
