[Child's voice] I'm coming to get you! [Laughter] Ring around the rosies. Pocketful of posies. Ashes, ashes... We all fall down! Six weeks in Rome, again! I don't know what my parents think has changed. Seriously, looking at piles of rocks gets old after a while. Do your parents need another daughter? Because I'll go. Yeah, my mom would love that. I thought you were working again this summer? Yeah, if I can find a job. You have two jobs! On-campus jobs. They don't offer full-time hours during the summer. Wait a second, I've got it! What? Actually, this could be great. What is it? My dad's friend is loaded. He has this place up north, on a vineyard, it's incredible. He's got two kids, which means he needs a nanny this summer. A nanny? Me? Well yeah, but... It's basically the same thing. Plus I think the little girl is learning French and you've tutored French, right? Oui, trois ans, ma chérie. Perf! You'll love it, and I promise he'll make it worth your while. Plus, I'll basically force him to hire you. I don't know... It's a couple of kids, how bad could it be? Hi, I'm Kate Jordan. My friend called and spoke to Mr. Martell about a job? Ms. Jordan! I'm in the conference room. Take the executive elevator, the code is 1318. Okay. In fact, when my wife passed away last year, it was Starlee's father who helped me through some of the worst of it. I'm very sorry for your loss. Look Kate, I'm going to be away more than usual this summer, thanks to an overseas merger. I need someone to look after my kids. You know I'm not a professional-- I know you're not, but Starlee says you have babysitting experience. Well, yes-- And you tutor French? I do. I've already been through three professionals already and none of them were a fit. But now that I've met you, I think my children are going to love you. Well, what are their names? There's Jack, our prince. He loves everything from archery to piano solos. He's a gentleman and a prankster. And our princess, Rose. She's an artist. She wants nothing more than to live in Paris one day and paint. So what do you say? I feel like I can trust you. The job is yours. You just met me-- I know, but my gut tells me you'll do a terrific job. And my gut is never wrong. And... in terms of compensation? Oh yes! How does twenty thousand sound? Twenty thousand dollars? Too low? No, it's... that's perfect. Good afternoon. You must be Katherine. I'm Ms. Grey, the housekeeper. Yeah, Mr. Martell told me about you. And please, call me Kate. Of course. Here, let me help you. No it's okay, I got it. Thank you. The other two girls made me carry theirs. I like you already. Thank you. down in the wine cellar. The tunnels run for half a mile underground. In your room... Wow. When can I meet Jack and Rose? Jack is still away at school for a few more weeks. But Rose is in her room across the hall. Why don't you introduce yourself? I know she's dying to meet you. And if you have any questions about anything, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. I will, thank you, Mrs. Grey. [Child humming in background] [Door knocking] Hi! Hello! Are all of these yours? Yeah, do you like them? I love them! You're very talented. Merci bo-koo. Tres bien! That's very good. Je m'appelle Kate. Comment appelez-vous? I only know "please" and "thank you." That's okay. We'll work on it. Thank you. What's her name? Hey, what's happening in this one? Oh, that's me and Jack playing a game. Well that's fun. Is he letting you out with that key? No... Locking me in. It was hard to breathe. I didn't like that game. [Alarm beeping] Dinner time! Are you hungry? I'm starving. I'll show you the way. Okay. So, you know Miss Kine? Starlee? Yeah, we're roommates. Ms. Grey doesn't like Starlee. That's not true. I just think she ought to pay attention when people are talking to her rather than looking at her cellphone. Ms. Grey is probably right. Ms. Grey thinks that perhaps it's time for coffee and dessert. How about that? And while I'm doing that, Kate, why don't you tell me about your experience? What was the last position you held? Well, when I was at school, I had two jobs. and the other was volunteering at the health center. Sounds like you know the value of hard work. Have you any family? No. They're all gone. I had a sister. But she... drowned last year. Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Rose? I polished all the spoons this afternoon. And I know you saw me polishing them. Now I'm going to ask you this once. Have you stolen one of the spoons? No. Rose! Tell me the truth. I didn't take it, I promise! Why don't we all look for it? That sounds wonderful. Rose, why don't we look for it? Okay. And Kate, why don't we look upstairs? Okay. You don't think she took it, do you? I think children aren't always angels, and if you give them an inch, they'll take a mile. They need boundaries, discipline. What does that mean? Oh, I'm sorry. I assumed, with the way that you said that, that you must have children of your own? I do not. But I do know these children as if they were. And I know when they're lying. Rose! Please come up here! I didn't take it. You know what the penalty is for lying... no dessert! Hey... I wouldn't worry about it. Grey's a hardass, but she means well. And if she gets angry, it'll blow over fast. Remember: you're in charge. Am I? When it comes to the kids, yes. You're the nanny. [Flight boarding announcement in background] I just feel so bad for Rose. She seems so sweet. We're boarding, I gotta go. I'll call you again soon. Ciao, bella! Okay, have a safe flight. I'm sorry if I scared you. That's okay. I just thought I locked the door. The door is wide open. You're probably just getting used to this place. There's a lot of history in these walls. Yeah, that's probably it. Is there something you needed? Mr. Martell sent us both an email. Oh, he did? "Forwarding you this from Jack's school. This is his third strike." It seems that Jack is being dismissed. "I trust you'll be able to handle this matter until I join you at the end of the month." "At the request of the school board..." "For the safety of the other students..." This sounds serious! Or like an overzealous faculty. Jack is certainly rambunctious, but he's far from dangerous. This says he may have pushed a classmate down a flight of stairs. That the boy was almost paralyzed! "May have." I imagine a snotty place like that doesn't know how to work with a boy like him. When you meet him tomorrow, you'll see. Jack wouldn't hurt a fly. Welcome home, Jack! Thank you, Ms. Grey. It's great to be back. Oh, and I brought you this. There's no need to spoil me. Well, not just you. Hello, Miss Jordan. It's a pleasure to meet you. You can call me Kate. And I've heard a lot about you. Just the good parts, right? Come along, Jack. You look like you could use a good home-cooked meal. What are they feeding you these days? Owww! What happened? The flowers... May I see? Owww! It's okay, it's just the roses have thorns. It's funny, mine didn't have any... ♪ Piano playing ♪ [Clapping] Excellent, Jack! You've improved so much. I stuck to my practice, like you said. What did you think, Kate? I thought it was very good. Just "very good"? That's all? It's certainly was the best version of The Entertainer I've heard from anyone your age. Rose? Why don't you join Jack? You both play so wonderfully together. Let's play our duet! Go on, Rose. Play... ♪ Piano playing ♪ Isn't he such a little gentleman? He's very gifted. I think the other boys are jealous of him. That's why Curtis caused all of this. Curtis, the boy who's accusing Jack of pushing him down the stairs? Oh yes, he's had it out for Jack for a long time. Jack won team captain over him and he has never let it go. ♪ Piano playing ♪ ♪ Piano playing stops suddenly ♪ Keep playing. I said, keep playing! ♪ Piano playing ♪ You don't want to talk to him about what happened at school? Oh, not tonight, no. I don't want to ruin his homecoming. They're so happy. [Loud crash, followed by crying] Oh my God! What happened? Jack smashed my fingers! I didn't! The cover slipped! I barely got my own hands out of the way! Rose, is that what happened? Jack, why did you hurt your sister? Now, just a moment. Isn't it possible that Jack is telling the truth, and Rose is lying just like she did last night? You two please go to your rooms. I need to speak with Ms. Grey. Now, please. Look, I know you've been here longer than I have. But I also know what I've been hired to do, and I'm going to do it. You said it yourself that children need discipline I think his father should know. I knew I liked you. You don't take any guff. So do whatever you like about Jack, but remember that Mr. Martell is a very busy man. Then, if you deem it still necessary, we can call Mr. Martell. Together. Why don't you come in, Kate? How's Rose? Lucky. Nothing's broken, just bruised. I've told Ms. Grey we should get that keyboard cover fixed. Are you happy to be home? It's fine, I guess. I heard that there was some trouble at school with one of the other boys... Curtis? Not from me, there wasn't. Jack, he's still in the hospital. He said you pushed him down the stairs. He wants to keep me from winning the Archery Cup next year. Why? Because he knows I'm better than he is. I just want you to know that I'm here to look after you and your sister, and I just want to start things off on the right foot. I want you to feel comfortable around me. Okay. Kate? Sleep well. When are you coming home? I'm just finishing up my work here in Japan. I should be back for Jack's birthday. I can't wait to see you. How's the new nanny working out? She's très bien! That's great, did she teach you that? Oui oui! You are doing so well. Is Miss Kate around? Can you put her on? Hi, Mr. Martell. How are things going? It's going well. There are some adjustments, of course. But everything is great! Great. Look, I had Ms. Grey set up an interview appointment for Rose at Chilton Academy this Friday. I can't make it, but I was wondering if you could sit in for me? Me? You'd be doing me a huge favor and you'd really be helping Rose out. The appointment is at 1 PM. I'm sending it to your calendar. [Cell phone buzzes] I got it. [Voice in background] Mr. Martell, we need you! Look, I've got to go. If you have any questions, just ask Ms. Grey. She knows how everything works around there. And if she's not there, just use your best judgment. - Thanks! - Okay. Goodbye princess! Bye daddy! Come on, let's go find Jack. Sleep well, Kate? She has some cakes she wants you to taste. Have you ever shot, Kate? Uh, no. But Ms. Grey really wants you in the kitchen. Why don't you try? Okay. So you hold this in this hand, then you take an arrow here... Yeah. Put it right there. Pull it back, and... Let it go! I want to try. That was the last arrow. Here, why don't you guys go gather them up? And I'm gonna let you shoot once I find out what Ms. Grey wants. That sounds good. Be careful, please. Watch out. Josephine! Oh my God! What do you think? I like it. What's the matter? You could have really hurt us, and why did you do this? I've never seen that before. Don't lie to me! What is that? This was Rose's favorite toy. Until she gave it to me as a present. And I found Jack using it as target practice! Jack... Why would I want to shoot at that? I gave you a chance. But you've shown me who you really are. Oh... And what's that supposed to mean? You're grounded. No phones, no computer, no video games. You can't do that! Oh yeah? Watch me. What are you doing? Exactly what I said I would. I'm going to call my dad! Please do. Ms. Grey, she's taking all of my stuff! Katherine, is this really necessary? I told you he was with me. And he says he didn't have any arrows. So who was shooting then? I don't know. Maybe one of the workers was having fun? But I don't think it was Jack. No one was hurt. Don't you think you're overreacting? I'm in charge and he's grounded. But I need my stuff! What you need to do is start thinking about an apology for me and your sister. Come on! Okay... I think it's working. Whoever finds these, whoever is watching. I'm recording this because I'm not sure if I can trust my own thoughts. I'm afraid that there's something wrong with Jack. That look in his eyes, I don't know where it comes from! it's almost like he wants to kill me. Dr. Bartlett, he knows more than he's telling. But as much as I try, I can't get him to talk to me. I don't know what to do. Dr. Bartlett? Yes? My name is Kate Jordan and I work with the Martells. I'm their nanny, I tried to call earlier, but nobody answered. Oh, sorry about that. I can't hear the phone out here in the garden. Come on in. What can I do for you? I found these papers at the Martell's. But they don't really make sense to me and I was just wondering if you could help me understand. Oh, these are just blood tests. They determine a patient's blood type in case there was ever need for a transfusion. Nothing out of the ordinary. There's also a DNA test. And I was wondering if you can tell me anything about that? Do you know why Mrs. Martell had these done? Tell me, what's your interest in this? I'm just trying to understand. Understand what? A few outbursts, temper tantrums. Well he's a boy. It comes with the territory. This is different. And I know that Mrs. Martell had concerns about Jack. This is really a private matter. I don't think I should be discussing this with you. Well, I can call Mr. Martell and get his consent, if that helps at all? Mrs. Martell came to me just before I retired. She was upset. She thought Jack wasn't her son. So I wanted to ease her mind, and I administered the DNA test. And it came back 100% positive. Now, I really have to get back to my gardening. But doctor, this just-- Young lady, I'm retired. I would like to be left alone. Okay. Can I help you? This car, it used to belong to a freind of mine. Same license plate. Elizabeth? You knew her? I work with her kids. Oh, wonderful. Welcome to Wine Country. I'm Joseph Donovan. Kate Jordan. Nice to meet you. You too. How did you know her? I did some carpentry work for the Martell's a few years back. It's terrible, what happened to Elizabeth. Falling down, hitting her head on that rock... Crazy accident. Yeah. I'm sure you've got your hands full taking care of those kids. At least you have help, right? Yeah, she's a tough cookie. I think it's good that you're there now. You'll be able to give those kids what they've been missing. And what's that? Love... and attention. Well, I've got to be going. Well it was nice to meet you. give me a call. You've got my number. I'll keep that in mind, thanks. Sure. What do you think you're doing? Playing a game. You went into my room? I didn't mean to, it's just... What? This game was the last gift my mother gave me before she died. We used to play together every night. I'm sorry if I upset you, it's just, it meant a lot to me... I'm not upset. I'm not. You just can't go into other people's rooms. And I told you, you were grounded. I left everything else in there. I didn't even take my phone or my laptop. But this... it's different. You can see why, can't you? Yes. But still... I'm sorry. What if I forget what to say? What if I mess up? You won't. And I'll be there right next to you the whole time, okay? Come on, we don't want to be late. We have an interview at 1 PM for Rose Martell. I don't see it here. Oh, here it is. I see what happened. Your interview was moved to earlier this morning and you didn't show up. What? Yes, I have it here. Last night, you called and adjusted it. I didn't call. What's your name? I'm Kate Jordan, I'm the nanny. It says it right here: Kate Jordan, rescheduled 8:30 AM. It just doesn't make any sense. Mr. Martell said the appointment was at 1. I have it on my calendar. Then what happened? Somebody switched it. But who? I think it could have been Jack. It might be one of his tricks. I hardly think so. Look, Katherine. It's not the end of the world. But I think we should inform Mr. Martell and see what he says. I can call him. No, no. I should do it. It's my responsibility. Look, this is a long shot, but I have a friend. Someone who knows the headmaster at Chilton. Perhaps I could give her a call? That would be amazing, would you? Of course. [Humming] [Screaming] [Loud crash] [Humming] What's the matter? What are you doing? Making a sandwich, want one? No, it's the middle of the night! I got hungry. Were you in my room? Why would I be in your room? Just answer the question. I have my own bedroom! Did you see anyone else? In here? Are you crazy? What is going on? Hi, Ms. Grey. Kate's acting weird. Is there a problem, Katherine? Yes and he was singing this song. Jack, get back to bed. But I didn't do anything. Now, Jack. Go. these past few days. You missed the interview at Chilton -- I told you-- I know. Someone changed the time. But now you're accusing Jack of being in your bedroom? I know what I saw. I was in your room earlier today cleaning. The medicine cabinet was open and I saw some of the anxiety medication that you're taking. Something having to do with losing your sister? That's private. You're right. It's none of my business, I'm sorry that I mentioned it. It's late. And I think we could all benefit from getting a good night's sleep. I'm sure you'll feel better in the morning. You're probably right. Yes. What's this? That's your room. That's Jack. Jack? Yes, he's playing hide and go seek. When was this? Last night. It was last night? This is important. Did you see Jack playing hide and seek last night? I saw him in the hallway. Looks like you could use a break! Why don't we show it to her? It's not too far from here. It's part of the estate? Woo! Higher! Go higher! Okay, don't let go! I won't. Jack, are you going on the Big Swing? Actually, I was going to suggest that you give it a try. I think I'm a little old for that. No you're not, I used to push my mother in it all the time. And she was a lot older than you. Then what're you waiting for? All right. Have you ever done this before? Why don't we make a little bet? You stay on longer than 30 seconds and you'll never have trouble with me again. And if I don't? You'll give me back my phone and my laptop. At least for the weekend. Deal. Ring-a-round the rosies... Pocket full of posies... Ashes, ashes... We all fall down. Okay, Jack... Ring around the rosies... Jack! Jack! Ashes, ashes! Can we slow down a little bit? Thirty-one seconds! Miss Kate, are you alright? I think it's broken. Okay, go to the car. You got away with a hairline fracture across the radius, that's it. It should heal in the next few weeks, but you should wear this for a few days. You don't have to worry about that. Does it still hurt? Yeah, a little bit. Ms. Grey just called. Did you tell her what you did? I told her there was an accident. I'm willing to look past this if you keep your word. Remember what you said? "Thirty seconds." A deal is a deal, Jack. A deal is a deal. No more misunderstandings. No more misunderstandings. We are so glad you could all be here But I have been so impressed with Jack's ability to handle the adversity and rise to the challenge. And I know his mother would be proud of the young man that he's becoming. Let's raise our glasses. To Jack! [Everyone] To Jack! Let's go! Kate, over here! Duty calls. Okay! Hey, nice one! Miss Kate, are you okay? I just got a little dizzy. Time to fly it up. Watch this! Ready? Here it comes again! Stop it! Cut it out, I'm serious! What's wrong with your voice? Had too much to drink? Look what you did! Stupid girl! Jack... Get out of my way, you're drunk! Come back here! I'm gonna get you! Jack, where are you going? He did something to my drink! Jack! Jack! Stop, Jack! (Mr. Martell) Jack, what's going on? Don't touch me! Are you okay? He pushed me. He pushed me! No I didn't! Nonsense, you're drunk! Go to your room. Go to your room! I think someone took my medication and mixed it in with my drink. I don't know how, but what I experienced today was a textbook case of an alcohol reaction. How can you be sure? I counted the pills, I know how many I had left. At least three or four were missing. And you think Jack did this? Ridiculous, he's just a child. I'm sorry, but the only pattern I've seen is Katherine making false accusations and exhibiting complete incompetence. That's not true! She's accused Jack of breaking into her bedroom, on an old swing. Jack told me it was part of the estate. Again, Jack's fault. And now today, you saw how she behaved at the party. She made a drunken fool out of herself and she even blames that on Jack. Look, I saw Jack push Kate. Ladies, that is it! I know what I saw. Mr. Martell, it's not just me. Mrs. Martell thought there was something wrong with Jack, too. She was afraid of him. I found this in my room. It was hidden in my dresser. I'm sorry, I tried to get in touch with you, but-- I was traveling. I'm recording this because I'm not sure if I can trust my own thoughts. I'm afraid that there's something wrong with Jack. It's almost like he wants to kill me. She never told me about any of this. I know Ms. Grey disagrees with me, but I truly believe that Jack is a danger to Rose. And if he isn't removed from this house, I fear for her life, too. Preposterous! Enough! I will take Jack with me in the morning. There's a military academy up north that I attended. And it is past time! Edward! It will crush him! I'm his father, Ms. Grey. And I will do what I think is right. I know this is going to be hard, but it's what I did when I was your age. And your grandfather, too. But I don't want to go! I understand. But I believe in you, son. I know that you can work through this. It'll make you stronger. Dad, please! I'm afraid. Don't be. Get your things together. We'll leave bright and early. What a day. I think you made the right decision. I fear that my being lax with him may have spoiled his character. Thank you, Kate. I know that dealing with Jack isn't easy. I just want Rose to be safe. And I want to reward that work appropriately. I'm adding a $5,000 bonus to your compensation. But... But what? I missed Rose's interview. That can be rescheduled. Look, my work overseas is done. I'll be in San Francisco the rest of the summer, so if you need anything... I'll call. You're really making a difference with Rose. I mean that. She's a very talented girl. She's her mother's daughter. Good night. Promise? Promise. Jack. Isn't there something you'd like to say to your sister? I'm sorry for the way I behaved. Very good. Do well, Jack. This is another chance. Don't waste it. This is a new beginning for you. It will be alright, Jack. And when I do, she won't be here. Let's go! Goodbye, Ms. Grey. Are you alright? Yes. I'm just... tired. Look, about last night. I wanted to apologize. I think with everything going on... I got a little emotional. I said some things I shouldn't. I just need you to know that I'm sorry. Thank you, that means a lot. Does that hurt? How about here? No. Okay. Rotate it for me? In fact, I think you're healing way ahead of schedule. So I can lose the sling? Only if you promise me that you'll take it easy. I promise. Okay. Can I ask you something? Your medical opinion? Of course. So, I have these medical records on the children and I'm just trying to figure out what they mean. Okay well, let's see. These are blood tests. This is the mother, AB positive. And this is the father, also AB positive. This doesn't add up. It says here that the child is O. That's probably why she ordered the DNA test. And it's a perfect match, but... But what? What do you mean? This company, CDC Diagnostics. This is who we go through for a test like this, but... There's something wrong with this form. Here, look. Okay, here. Look at this. Okay, see the clear difference in the two forms? This one has a different format. And in this one, the data is in the wrong place. So you're saying it's a forgery? Looks that way to me. Yeah, we worked together before he retired. And was he... honest? He's wonderful. A great doctor. [Door knocking] Dr. Bartlett? [Door knocking] Dr. Bartlett! Yes? You didn't tell me it's impossible for two parents with AB positive blood to have a son who's type O blood. Where did you hear that? From your colleague, Dr. Goldman. She's wrong. She also told me that these DNA reports, they look like forgeries. is she wrong about that, too? She showed me another test from the same lab. The format doesn't match. So either she's lying, or you are. Young lady, I don't have the time or the inclination to debate you. You believe what you want. I've moved on, and so should you. I can't. I've taken care of Rose Martell for the past month. And I've seen how loving she is, she's perfect. But her brother, there's just-- There's something wrong. And I need to know the truth for her sake. I'm sorry. With a different doctor. [Phone ringing] Ms. Grey? The phone! [Phone ringing] You were right. About the DNA test? About everything. When can we talk about this? Can I come over there tonight and meet you? No, not tonight. Tomorrow. There's a little cafe in the town, just off the square. Could you meet at 11? Yeah, I'll be there. Thank you. Hello? Hello? [Taser shock] [Screaming] You've been hit with enough electricity to short circuit your pacemaker. That pain you're feeling in your chest is your heart trying to pump blood to your body. But it can't... Oh Dr. Bartlett, if only you could have been this quiet all along. [Door knocking] Dr. Bartlett? Dr. Bartlett? Elizabeth Martell... The child was delivered... died moments later... [Cell phone ringing] [Gasp] You were meeting him for coffee? He never showed. So you came here? I was hoping to speak with him. One of the children that I take care of. Bartlett was his doctor. How did he die? Looks like a heart attack. If you'll just sign this statement. Yeah. Thanks, we'll be in touch. [Knocking gently] You found it! I know what you did. What are you talking about? I know you murdered Dr. Bartlett. Murder? You must be out of your mind. I found your earring at his house. What? I was there this morning. He was supposed to meet me for coffee, but he never showed. And then I found him dead. Well I'm sorry to hear that. Dr. Bartlett was... a friend. I saw him a couple of days ago. That must be how I lost that. Why would I murder Dr. Bartlett? Because he was going to tell me the truth about Jack. What truth? That he's not Elizabeth's son. Oh, Katherine... Not this again! well, it's disturbing. The same night that Elizabeth gave birth, a newborn was abandoned at the hospital. Where did you hear that? Bartlett kept a personal log of all the patients he ever worked with. It's right here. It says that Elizabeth's child died shortly after it was born, and Bartlett hid it from the family. He substituted the abandoned child and they never knew. Jack's not their son. And you killed him to keep him from telling me the truth. But why? Why? Have you spoken with Mr. Martell? Yes. I called him, he knows everything. I'm sorry Katherine, but that's a lie. He's been in meetings all day. I have his schedule. I left a message. I think your time as a nanny in this house is just about up. Give me your phone, Katherine. I can't have you bothering Mr. Martell with this nonsense anymore. Why would I be mad at you? Ms. Grey always gets mad when I'm playing here, but my drawings are all over the floor of my room, so-- Please, shhh! We need to leave, quietly. Why, what's going on? Rose, please! We're playing a game with Ms. Grey. Rose? Katherine? Okay, come on. Tip toe. Shhh. Come on! [Cell phone ringing] Hurry! Good afternoon, Mr. Martell. Also, is Kate there? She called earlier and it sounded like she was worried about something. Oh... uh... She just left a few minutes ago. Went into town for dinner, but everything's fine. Nothing to worry about. All right, I'll try her later, Ms. Grey. Not a problem, sir. Where are we going? What's happening? I don't know... Rose, hang on, okay? What's the problem? Kate? What happened? Look, I'm sorry but do you have a phone? Not on me, I left it back at the house. I can give you a lift back to my place and you can call whoever you need from there. Oh God yeah, please. Who do you need to call? The police. Oh wow, is it serious? Yeah, it's really serious. Look, I'll tell you about it in a minute, let me just get-- Kate, no! Oh good, you're awake. Where's Rose? Don't worry about Rose, my husband's taking care of her. You can't lock me in here, let me out! Husband? You mean Donovan? You know too much, Katherine. About everything. [Finger snap] Pay attention when I'm talking to you! You know, they say there's nothing more powerful than a mother's instinct to protect her children. This isn't about me, it's about my son. Jack. The abandoned baby. So I dropped the baby off at the hospital, hoping that someone would give it a better life than I could. I'm sorry. It was the most painful decision I ever made. Leaving him there... Hearing him cry for me. But I told myself it was for the best. [Baby crying] But I didn't count on what happened next. Dr. Bartlett was just coming off a 36-hour shift. Getting ready to deliver Elizabeth's baby, but he was tired, he made a mistake. The baby died, but he didn't tell the Martell's. Instead, he gave them my baby. He gave them Jack. I was tormented about what I had done. But then I decided to get sober. And the only thing keeping me alive was the hope that one day I would see my son again. So I searched the newspapers and I discovered that the only boy that was born in the hospital that night was the Martell's son. You're not gonna get me! And when I finally saw him for the first time... I knew he was mine. How did you get to be so fast? Jack. And you started working for the Martells. I told you: a mother will do anything to protect her son. Even murder? I had no choice. Elizabeth knew too much. But why did you have to kill her? We couldn't lose everything. What do you mean? This. Jack's inheritance. If it came out that Jack wasn't her son, he would lose it all and then-- Where would that leave me? This is crazy, the police will never-- The police will know what I tell them. They'll know that a young woman, who was suffering from nightmares and delusions, who was seen in a public stupor at Jack's party, fell into a depression. And after consulting with Dr. Bartlett, you flew into a rage, and you murdered him. What? No! And then you took your own life. By overdosing on your medication. Shhh, it's okay Katherine. It won't hurt. Well, at least not for very long. What the-- You won't get away with this. No? Well who's going to stop me? Bartlett's dead. Elizabeth took her secret to the grave. And Rose will soon find a very tragic end. And then, well, when the timing's right, Edward will suddenly die too. And then finally, all of this will be Jack's. And mine. You're sick... Oh actually, that's going to be you. Once the pills kick in. She's gone. What? Rose! Well she couldn't have gone very far. Let's go find her. Don't move, Katherine. See? Where is she? The gate's open, come on! Rose? Come on out, you little angel. We're just playing a game. Rose? Quickly, find something to cut me out of these before they come back. Yeah, that's good. I know the way to the neighbors. I can get my truck, drive down a click or two. She couldn't have gotten far. Rose is in the house. What, how do you know? Because she's smarter than you. It's just over here, through the canyon. Let's go this way. Stop! Katherine... Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be. Down here, come on! Service entrance on the bronze hook: get the key. Is there another way out, Rose? No, I'm sorry. That's okay, follow me. Rose? Kate? What? Katherine? There's no way out. [Bottle shattering] Donovan? Drop the bottle! Please, let her go! Drop it Katherine, or we'll change the narrative a little bit and instead of poisoning Rose, you'll snap her neck! No no, I'm putting it down. I'm putting it down, okay? Now that's more like it. Thank you, Katherine. Now back it up! Into the catacombs, slowly... Rose... [Speaking French] What are you saying to her Katherine? What did you just say to her? [Speaking French] Oui! Katherine! Daddy! You little-- It's the end of the summer. I have to go back to school. Come here. But your dad's here. And you know what? I talked to him. And he's going to work from home from now on. No more long trips? No more long trips. And now that your father has custody of Jack, he'll get to spend more time with him too. That's you, and that's me, and that's us in Paris. I hope we get to go! If you practice your French. Je vais. Rose! You're going to miss your brother. Come on down. It's alright, I'll be right there, okay? I've made new friends and the food is pretty good. Well I'm glad to hear it. You know, back in my day, the food was not great. And Rose, I made you something... It's a painting, you like it? It's okay. I've been using my free time to practice my painting skills. Maybe when I get back, you could show me a thing or two? Sure. They don't let us use bow and arrows here. Well, I spoke with a professional counselor and I spoke with Sergeant Bannister, and they both agree that spending some time at the Academy over the next year will be the best thing for you. I want to come home, now! They won't let me use my phone or my laptop! And there's no computer games here anyway! I think for now, we'll, we'll just stay put. Okay, buddy? No, please daddy... Please let me come home. Please I'll be good, I promise. Time's up, cadet. I want to thank you again, for everything. Are you sure you're gonna be able to manage? Well, the business should be able to run itself now. And really my place is here. With Rose. Well if you need someone next summer. How do you feel about Paris? That's up to her. Okay, come here. I'll see you soon. See you soon.
