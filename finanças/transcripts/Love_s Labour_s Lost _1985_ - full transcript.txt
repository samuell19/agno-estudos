[dramatic music] Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives, live registered upon our brazen tombs. And then grace us in the disgrace of death. When, spite of cormorant devouring time, the endeavor of this present breath may buy that honor that shall bate his scythe's keen edge and make us heirs of all eternity. Therefore brave conquerors for so you are that war against your own affections and the huge army of the world's desires. Our late edict shall strongly stand in force. Navarre shall be the wonder of the world. Our court shall be a little academe, still and contemplative in living art. You three, Biron, Dumain and Longaville, have sworn for three years' term to live with me, my fellow scholars and to keep those statutes that are recorded in this schedule here. Your oaths are passed and now subscribe your names, that his own hand may strike his honor down that violates the smallest branch herein. If you are armed to do as sworn to do subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too. I am resolved. 'Tis but a three years' fast. The mind shall banquet though the body pine. My loving lord, Dumain is mortified. The grosser manner of these world's delights he throws upon the gross world's baser slaves. To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die with all these living in philosophy. I can but say their protestation over so much, dear liege, I've already sworn, that is to live and study here three years. But there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term, which I hope well is not enrolled there. And one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside, the which I hope is not enrolled there. And then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day, when I was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day. Which I hope well is not enrolled there. Oh these are barren tasks, too hard to keep. Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep! [Ferdinand] Your oath is passed to pass away from these. Let me say no my liege and if you please I only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years' space. You swore to that Biron and to the rest. By yea and nay sir, then I swore in jest. What is the end of study, let me know. Why that to know which else we should not know. Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense. Ay that is study's godlike recompense. Come on then, I'll swear to study so, to know the thing I am forbid to know. As thus, to study where I well may dine, when I to feast expressly am forbid. Or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid. Or having sworn too hard a keeping oath, study to break it and not break my troth. If study's gain be thus and this be so, study knows that which yet it doth not know. Swear me to this and I'll ne'er say no. [Ferdinand] These be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight. Why all delights are vain, but that most vain, which with pain purchased doth inherit pain. As painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth, while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look. Light seeking light doth light of light beguile. So ere you find where light in darkness lies, your light grows dark by losing of your eyes. Study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye, who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by. These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and what not what they are. Too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name. [Ferdinand] How well he's read, to reason against reading! Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding. [Ferdinand] Well, sit you out. Go home, Biron. Adieu. No my good lord, I've sworn to stay with you. And though I have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say, yet confident I'll keep what I've swore and bide the penance of each three years' day. Give me the paper, let me read the same and to the strictest decree I'll write my name. [Ferdinand] How well this yielding rescues thee from shame! Item, that no woman shall come within a mile of my court. Hath this been proclaimed? Four days ago. Let's see the penalty. On pain of losing her tongue. Who devised this penalty? Marry, that did I. Sweet lord and why? To fright them hence with that dread penalty. A dangerous law against gentility! Item. If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise. This article, my liege, yourself must break. For well you know here comes in embassy the French king's daughter with yourself to speak. A maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of Aquitaine to her decrepit, sick and bedrid father. What say you lords, why this was quite forgot. So study evermore is overshot. We must of force dispense with this decree, she must lie here on mere necessity. Necessity will make us all forsworn 3000 times within this three years' space. If I break faith this word shall speak for me. I am forsworn on mere necessity. So to the laws at large I write my name. And he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame. Suggestions are to other as to me but I believe, although I seem so loath, I'm the last that will last keep his oath. But is there no quick recreation granted? Ay that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted with a refined traveler of Spain. A man in all the world's new fashion planted that hath a mint of phrases in his brain. One whom the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony. A man of complements, whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny. This child of fancy, that Armado hight, for interim to our studies shall relate in high-born words the worth of many a knight from tawny Spain lost in the world's debate. How you delight, my lords, I know not I, but I protest I love to hear him lie. And I will use him for my minstrelsy. [gentle music] Boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy? A great sign sir that he will look sad. Why sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp. No, no, oh Lord sir, no. How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenile? By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior. -Why tough senior? -Why tender juvenile? -Why tough senior? -Why tender juvenile? I spoke it, tender juvenile, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tender. And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough. Pretty apt. How mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt or I apt and my saying pretty? Thou pretty because little. Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt? And therefore apt because quick. Speak you this in my praise, master? In thy condign praise. I will praise an eel with the same praise. What, that an eel is ingenious? That an eel is quick. I do say thou art quick in answers, thou heats my blood. I am answered, sir. I love not to be crossed. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir. I confess both, they are both the varnish of the complete man. I have promised to study three years with the duke. But I hereupon confess I am in love and as it is base for a soldier to love so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humor of affections would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it I would take desire prisoner and ransom him to any French courtier for a new devised curtsy. I think scorned to sigh. Me thinks I should out swear Cupid. Comfort me boy. What great men have been in love? Hercules master. Oh most sweet Hercules. More authority dear boy, name more and sweet my child. Make them men of good repute and carriage. Samson master. He was a man of good carriage, great carriage. For he carried the town gates on his back like a porter. And he was in love. Oh well-knit Samson! Strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth? A woman, master. Of what complexion? Of the seawater green, sir. Is that one of the four complexions? As I have read sir and the best of them too. I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well. My spirit grows heavy in love. [gentle music] [bell ringing] A letter from the magnificent Armado. How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words. A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience! To hear or forebear hearing. The matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner. In what manner? In manner and form following sir. All those three. I was seen with her in the manor house, sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which, put together, is in manner and form following. Now sir, for the manner. It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman for the form in some form. And for the following sir? As it shall follow in my correction and God defend the right! Will you hear this letter with attention. As we would hear an oracle. Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh. Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god, and body's fostering patron. Not a word of Costard yet. So it is-- It may be so but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so. Peace. Be to me and every man that dares not fight! No words. Of other men's secrets. I beseech you. So it is, besieged with sable-colored melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humor to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air. And, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The time when, about the sixth hour, when beasts most graze, birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called -Dinner. -supper. Supper, supper! So much for the time when. Now for the ground which, which I mean, I walked upon. It is yclept thy park. Then for the place Where! Where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-colored ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or -Seest. -seest. But to the place where. It standeth north-north-east and by east from the west colored corner of thy curious knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minnow of thy mirth-- -Who? -Me. That unlettered small knowing soul. Me? That shallow vassal. Still me? Which as I remember hight Costard. [Costard] Ah me. sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, which with, oh with, but with this I passion to say wherewith-- With a wench. With a child of our grandmother Eve. A female. Or for thy more sweet understanding, a woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony Dull, a man of good repute, carriage, bearing and estimation. Me, an't shall please you, I am Anthony Dull. For Jaquenetta, so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain, I keep her as a vessel of thy law's fury and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial. Thine in all compliments of devoted and heart-burning heat of duty, Don Adriano de Armado. This is not so well as I looked for, but the best that ever I heard. Ay, the best for the worst. But sirrah, what say you to this? Sir I confess the wench. Did you hear the proclamation? I do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it. It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench. I was taken with none sir, I was taken with a damsel. Well it was proclaimed damsel. This was no damsel neither sir, she was a virgin. It is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin. If it were I deny her virginity. I was taken with a maid. This maid will not serve your turn sir. This maid will serve my turn sir. Sir I will pronounce your sentence. You will fast a week with bran and water. I'd rather pray a month a month with mutton and porridge. And Don Armado shall be your keeper. My Lord Biron, see him delivered to him. [bell ringing] [door banging] Sir, sir. Sir the duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe and you must suffer him to take no delight, nor no penance. But must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park. She is allowed for the day woman. Fare-you-well. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid! Man. I will visit thee at the lodge. That's hereby. I know where it is situate. Lord how wise you are. I will tell thee wonders. With that face. I love thee. So I heard you say. And so farewell. Fare weather after you. Come Jaquenetta, away Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offenses ere thou be pardoned. Well sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach. [Don] Thou shalt be heavily punished. I am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but lightly rewarded. Take away this villain, shut him up. Come you transgressing slave. Away! Let me not be pent up, sir. I will fast being loose. No sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to prison. Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see. What shall some see? Nay nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man and therefore I can be quiet. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. Yet how can that be true love if falsely attempted? Love is a familiar, love is a devil. There is no evil angel but love. Yet was Samson so tempted and he had an excellent strength and yet was Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit. Cupid's butt-shaft is too heavy for Hercules' club and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. Adieu, valor! Rust rapier! Be still, drum! For your manager is in love. Yay he loveth. [gentle classical music] Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise wit. Write, pen. For I am for whole volumes in folio. Now madam, summon up your dearest spirits. Consider who the king your father sends, to whom he sends and what's his embassy. Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem, to parley with the sole inheritor of all perfections that a man may owe, matchless Navarre. The plea of no less weight than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen. Be now as prodigal of all dear grace as nature was in making graces dear when she did starve the general world beside and prodigally gave them all to you. Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean, needs not the painted flourish of your praise. Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye, not uttered by base sale of Chapman's tongues. I am less proud to hear you tell my worth than you much willing to be counted wise in spending your wit in the praise of mine. But now to task the tasker. Good Boyet, you are not ignorant, all-telling fame doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow. To painful study shall outwear three years. No woman may approach his silent court. Therefore to seemeth it a needful course, before we enter his forbidden gates to know his pleasure and in that behalf, bold of your worthiness, we single you as our best-moving fair solicitor. Tell him the daughter of the King of France, on serious business craving quick dispatch, importunes personal conference with his grace. Haste. Signify so much. Whilst we attend, like humble-visaged suitors, his high will. Proud of employment, willingly I go. All pride is willing pride and yours is so. Who are the votaries, my loving lords, that are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke? Lord Longaville is one. -Know you the man? -I know him, madam. At a marriage feast, Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized in Normandy, saw I this Longaville. Well? A man of sovereign parts, peerless, esteemed, well fitted in arts, glorious in arms. Nothing becomes him ill that he would well. The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss, if virtue's gloss will stain with any soil, is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will, whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills it should none spare that come within his power. Some merry mocking lord, belike is't so? They say so most that most his humors know. Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow. Who are the rest? The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth, of all that virtue love for virtue loved. Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill. For he hath wit to make an ill shape good and shape to win grace though he had no wit. Another of these students at that time was there with him, if I have heard a truth. Biron they call him, but a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth. I never spent an hour's talk withal. His eye begets occasion for his wit. For every object that the one doth catch the other turns to a mirth-moving jest, which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor, delivers with such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished. So sweet and voluble is his discourse. God bless my ladies! Are they all in love that every one her own hath garnished with such bedecking ornaments of praise? [Man] Here comes Boyet. Now, what admittance lord? Navarre had notice of your fair approach and he and his competitors in oath were all addressed to meet you, gentle lady, before I came. Marry, thus much I have learned. He rather means to lodge you in the field like one that comes here to besiege his court than seek a dispensation for his oath to let you enter his unpeopled house. Here comes Navarre. Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre. Fair I give you back again and welcome I have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine. You shall be welcome, madam, to my court. I will be welcome, then. -Conduct me thither. -Hear me, fair lady. I have sworn an oath. Our lady help my lord, he'll be forsworn. Not for the world, dear madam, by my will. Why will shall break it. Will and nothing else. Your ladyship is ignorant what it is. Were my lord so his ignorance were wise, well now his knowledge must prove ignorance. I hear your grace hath sworn out housekeeping. It were a deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord, and sin to break it. But pardon me. I am too sudden bold. To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me. Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming and suddenly resolve me in my suit. Madam I will if suddenly I may. You will the sooner, that I may away for you'll prove perjured if you make me stay. Did I not dance with you in Brabant once? Did I not dance with you in Brabant once? I know you did. How needless was it then to ask the question! You must not be so quick. 'Tis long of you that spur me with such questions. Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, it will tire. [Rosaline] Not till it leave the rider in the mire. What time of day? The hour that fools should ask. Oh fair befall your mask! Fair fall the face it covers! And send you many lovers! Amen. So you be none. Nay then will I be gone. Madam, your father here doth intimate the payment of 100,000 crowns being but one half of an entire sum disbursed by my father in his wars. But say that he or we, as neither have, received that sum, there yet remains unpaid 100,000 more, in surety of the which one part of Aquitaine is bound to us, although not valued to the money's worth. If then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied, we will give up our right in Aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty. But that, it seems, he little purposeth. For here he doth demand to have repaid 100,000 crowns and not demands, on payment of a 100,000 crowns, to have his title live in Aquitaine, which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is. Dear Princess, were not his requests so far from reason's yielding, your fair self should make a yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to France again. You do the king, my father, too much wrong and wrong the reputation of your name, in so unseeming to confess receipt of that which hath so faithfully been paid. I do protest I never heard of it and if you prove it, I'll repay back or yield up Aquitaine. We arrest your word. Boyet, you can produce acquittances for such a sum from special officers of Charles his father. Satisfy me so. So please your grace, the packet has not come where that and other specialties are bound. Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them. It shall suffice me. At which interview all liberal reason I will yield unto. Meantime receive such welcome at my hand as honor, without breach of honor, may make tender of to thy true worthiness. You may not come, fair princess, within my gates but here without you shall be so received as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart, although denied fair harbor in my house. Your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell. Tomorrow shall we visit you again. Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace! Thy own wish wish I thee in every place! Sir I pray you a word. What lady is that same? The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name. A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well. I beseech you a word. What is she in the white? A woman sometimes and you saw her in the light. Perchance light in the light, I desire her name. She's an heir of Falconbridge. What's her name in the cap? Rosaline by good hap. Is she wedded or no? To her will sir, or so. You're welcome sir. Adieu. Farewell to me sir and welcome to you. That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord. Not a word with him but a jest. And every jest but a word. It was well done of you to take him at his word. I was as willing to grapple as he was to board. Two hot sheeps, marry. And wherefore not ships? No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips. You sheep and I pasture. Shall that finish the jest? So you grant pasture for me. Not so, gentle beast. My lips are no common, though several they be. Belonging to whom? To my fortunes and me. Good, wits will be jangling but gentles agree, this civil war of wits were much better used on Navarre and his book men, for here it is abused. If my observation, which very seldom lies, by the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes, deceive me not now, Navarre is infected. With what? With that which we lovers entitle affected. Your reason? Why, all his behaviors did make their retire to the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire. His heart, like an agate, with your print impressed, proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed. His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see, did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be. All senses to that sense did make their repair to feel only looking on fairest of fair. Methought all his senses were locked in his eye, as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy. Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glassed, did point you to buy them along as you passed. His face's own margent did quote such amazes that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes. I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his and you give him for my sake but one loving kiss. Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skillfully. He's Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him. Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim. [soaring classical music] [Biron] If love make me forsworn how shall I swear to love? Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed. Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove. Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed. Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes, where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend. [gentle music] [singing in foreign language] Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years. Take this key, give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither. He must carry me a letter to my love. A message will sympathized. A horse to be ambassador for an ass. Ha ha, what sayest thou? Marry sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very slow-gaited. But I go sir, as swift as lead. The meaning pretty ingenious. Is not lead a metal, heavy dull and slow? [speaking in foreign language] honest master or rather, master, no. I say lead is slow. You are too swift to say so sir. Is that lead slow that is fired from a gun? A most acute juvenile. Volable and full of grace. By thy favor sweet welkin I must sigh and I face. Oh most rude melancholy, valor gives the place. [laughing] A wonder, master! Here's a Costard broken in a shin. Some enigma, some riddle. Come thy [speaking in foreign language] begin. No enigma, no riddle, no [speaking in foreign language], no salve in the mail, sir. Oh sir plantain, a plain plantain! No [speaking in foreign language], no [speaking in foreign language], no salve sir, but a plantain! By virtue, thou enforces me to laughter. Thy silly thought my spleen. The heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling. Oh pardon me, my stars! Does the inconsiderate take the word [speaking in foreign language] for a salve? Do the wise think them other? Is not [speaking in foreign language] a salve? No, page. It is some epilogue or discourse, to make plain some obscure precedence that hath to for been sain. I will example it. The fox, the ape and the humble bee were still at odds being but three. There's the moral. Now the [speaking in foreign language]. I will add the [speaking in foreign language]. Say the moral again. The fox, the ape and the humble bee, were still at odds, being but three. Until the goose came out of door and stayed the odds by adding four. Now will I begin your moral and you follow with my [speaking in foreign language]. The fox, the ape and the humble bee, were still at odds, being but three. And then the goose came out of door, staying the odds by adding four. A good [speaking in foreign language] ending in the goose. Would you desire more? [laughing] How did this argument begin? By saying here's a costard broken in a shin, then called you for the [speaking in foreign language]. True and I for a plantain. Tell me how was there a costard broken in a shin? I will tell you sensibly. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth. I will speak that [speaking in foreign language]. I Costard, running out, that was safely within, fell over the threshold and broke my shin. We will talk no more of this matter. [Costard] Till there be more matter in the shin. Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee. Oh marry me to one Frances, I smell some [speaking in foreign language], some goose, in this. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person. Thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound. True, true and now you will be my purgation and let me loose. I will give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance and in lieu thereof, impose nothing on thee but this. Bear this significant to the country maid Jaquenetta. Here is remuneration. For the best ward of mine honor is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow. Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! Oh, that's the Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings. Remuneration. What's the price of this inkle? One penny. No, I'll give you a remuneration. Why, it carries it. Remuneration! It's a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word. [Biron] Oh my good knave Costard, exceedingly well met. Pray you sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration? What is a remuneration? [Costard] Marry sir, halfpenny farthing. Why then, three-farthing's worth of silk. [Costard] I thank your worship, God be with you. Stay slave, I must employ thee. As thou would win my favor, good my knave, do one thing for me that I shall entreat. [Costard] When would you have it done, sir? This afternoon. [Costard] Well I will do it, sir. Fare you well. Thou knowest not what it is. [Costard] I shall know sir when I've done it. Why villain, thou must know first. [Costard] I will come to your worship tomorrow morning. It must be done this afternoon. Hark slave, it is but this. The princess comes to hunt here in the park. In her train there's a gentle lady. When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name. Rosaline they call her. Rosaline. Ask for her. And to her white hand see thou do commend this sealed-up counsel. There's thy guerdon. Go. Guerdon. Oh sweet guerdon. Better than remuneration. 'leven-pence farthing better. Most sweet guerdon! I will do it sir, in print. Guerdon! Remuneration! And I, forsooth, in love! I that have been love's whip, a very beadle to a humorous sigh, a critic, nay, a night-watch constable. A domineering pedant o'er the boy. Than whom no mortal so magnificent! This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy. This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid. Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms, the anointed sovereign of sighs and groans. Liege of all loiterers and malcontents. Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces. Sole imperator and great general of trotting 'paritors. Oh my little heart! And I to be a corporal in his field and wear his colors like a tumbler's hoop! What! I love, I sue! I seek a wife! A woman? That's like a German clock, still a-repairing, ever out of frame. Never going right, being a watch, but being watched that it may still go right. Nay. To be perjured, which is worst of all. And amongst three to love the worst of all. A wightly wanton with a velvet brow, with two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes. Ay and by heaven, one that will do the deed though Argus were her eunuch and her guard. And I to sigh for her, to watch for her, to pray for her. Go to, it is a plague that Cupid will impose for my neglect of his almighty dreadful little might. Well. I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan. Some men must love my lady and some Joan. Was that the king that spurred his horse so hard against the steep uprising of the hill? I know not but I think it was not he. Who'er it was has showed a mounting mind. [laughing] Well lords, today we shall have our dispatch. On Saturday we will return to France. Then forester, my friend, where is the bush that we must stand and play the murderer in? Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice. A stand where you may make the fairest shoot. But comes the bow now mercy goes to kill. The poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill. [Boyet] Here comes a member of the commonwealth. God dig-you-den all! [All] God dig-you-den. Pray you, which is the head lady? Oh thou shalt know her, fellow, by the others that have no heads. Which is the greatest lady, the highest? The thickest and the tallest. The thickest and the tallest. It is so. Truth is truth. And your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit. One of these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit. Are not you the chief woman? You're the thickest here. What's your will, sir? What's your will? I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline. Oh thy letter, thy letter! He's a good friend of mine. Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve. Break up this capon. I am bound to serve. Oh this letter is mistook, it importeth none here. It is writ to Jaquenetta. We will read it, I swear. Break the neck of the wax and every one give ear. By heaven that thou art fair is most infallible, true, that thou art beauteous, truth itself, that thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The magnanimous and most illustrate King Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say, veni, vidi, vici, which to annothanize in the vulgar, oh base and obscure vulgar, videlicet, he came, saw and overcame. He came, one, saw two, overcame three. [laughing] Who came, the king. Why did he come, to see. Why did he see, to overcome. To whom came he, to the beggar. What saw he? The beggar. Who overcame he, the beggar. The conclusion is victory on whose side. The king's! [laughing] The captive is enriched on whose side. The beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial on whose side, the king's. No on both in one or one in both. I am the king for so stands the comparison. Thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness. What should I exchange for rags, robes, for tittles, titles, for thyself, me. Thus, expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture and my heart on thy every part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry, Don Adriando de Armado. What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter? What vane, what weathercock? Did you ever hear better? I am much deceived but I remember the style. Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile. This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court. A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport to the prince and his book mates. Thou fellow, a word. Who gavest thou this letter? I told you, my lord. To whom shouldst thou give it? From my lord to my lady. From which lord to which lady? From my Lord Biron, a good master of mine, to a lady of France that he called Rosaline. Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come lords, away. Here sweet, put up this. 'Twill be thine another day. [gentle music] Who is the suitor, who is the suitor? Shall I teach you to know? Ay my continent of beauty. Why, she that bears the bow. Finely put off! My lady goes to kill horns but if thou marry hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry. Finely put on! Well then, I am the shooter. [Boyet] And who is your deer? If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near. Finely put on, indeed! You still wrangle with her, Boyet and she strikes at the brow. But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now? Shall I come upon thee with an old saying that was a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as touching the hit it? So I may answer thee with one as old that was a woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little wench as touching the hit it. Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it. Thou canst not hit it, my good man. An I cannot, cannot, cannot, an I cannot, another can. Oh my troth, most sweet jests. Most incony vulgar wit when it comes so smoothly off. So obscenely as it were. So fit. Very reverend sport, truly and done in the testimony of a good conscience. The deer was, as you know, [speaking in foreign language], in blood. Ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo, the sky, the heaven, the welkin and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra, the soil, the land, the earth. Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least, but sir, I assure ye, it was a buck of the first head. Sir Nathaniel, [speaking in a foreign language]. 'Twas not a [speaking in foreign language], 'twas a pricket. Most barbarous intimation! Yet a kind of insinuation, as it were, in via, in way of explication. [speaking in foreign language], as it were. Replication or rather, [speaking in foreign language], as it were, to show his inclination, after his undressed, unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained or rather unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my [speaking in foreign language] for a deer. I said the deer was not a [speaking in foreign language], twas a pricket. Twice-sod simplicity, beast coctus, oh thou monster ignorance, how deformed dost thou look! Sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book. He hath not eat paper, as it were. He hath not drunk ink, his intellect is not replenished. He's only an animal, only sensible in the duller parts. And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be, which we have taste and knowledge are, for those parts which do fructify in us more than he. For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool, so where there a patch set on learning to see him in a school. But [speaking in foreign language] say I, being of an old father's mind. Many can brook the weather that love not the wind. You two are book men. Can you tell me by your wit what was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five weeks old as yet? Dictynna, goodman Dull, Dictynna goodman Dull. What is Dictynna? A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon. The moon was a month old when Adam was no more and raught not to five weeks when he came to five score. The allusion holds in the exchange. 'Tis true indeed. The collusion holds in the exchange. God comfort thy capacity! I say the allusion holds in the exchange. And I say the pollution holds in the exchange for the moon is never but a month old. And I say beside that was a pricket that the princess killed. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer? And to humor the ignorant, call the deer the princess killed a pricket. [speaking in foreign language], good Master Holofernes. [speaking in foreign language] So it shall please you to abrogate scurrility. I will something affect the letter for it argues facility. The preyful princess pricked and pierced a pretty pleasing pricket. Some say a sore, but not a sore, till now made sore with shooting. The dogs did yell, put yell to sore, and soil jumps from thicket or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall a-hooting. If sore be sore, then L to sore makes 50 sores a sorel of one sore I and hundred make by adding but one more L. A rare talent! This gift that I have, simple, simple. Foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute and I am thankful for it. Sir I praise the Lord for you. And so may my parishioners. For their sons are well tutored by you and their daughters profit very greatly under you. You are a good member of the commonwealth. [speaking in foreign language] If their sons be ingenuous, they shall want no instruction and if their daughters be capable I will put it to 'em but [speaking in foreign language]. [laughing] Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter. It was given me by Costard and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you, read it. [speaking in foreign language] And so forth. Good old Mantuan! I may speak of thee as the traveler doth of Venice. Venetia, Venetia, [speaking in foreign language] Old Mantuan, old Mantuan. Who understandeth thee not loves thee not. [singing in foreign language] Under pardon sir, what are the contents, or as Horace says in his, what my soul. Verses? Ay sir and very learned. Let me hear a staff, a stanza, a verse. [speaking in foreign language] If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice. Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend. All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder. Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire. Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder. Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire. Celestial as thou art, oh pardon, love, this wrong, That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue. You do not find the apostrophes and so miss the accent. Let me supervise the canzonet. Here are only numbers ratified, but for the elegancy, facility and golden cadence of poesy, caret. Ovidius Naso was the man and why, indeed, Naso. I don't know. For smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy. The jerks of invention. [speaking in foreign language] is nothing, so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damoiselle virgin, was this directed to you? Ay, sir. I will overglance the superscript. To the snow white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline. I will look again on the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto. Your ladyship's in all desired employment. Biron. Oh! Sir Nathaniel this Biron is one of the votaries with the king and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen, which accidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my sweet. Deliver this paper into the royal hand of the king. It may concern much. Stay not thy compliment, I forgive thy duty, adieu. Sir you have done this in the fear of God very religiously and as a certain father saith-- Sir tell me not of the father but to return to these verses. Sir Nathaniel, did they please you. Marvelous well for the pen. I do dine today at the father's of a certain pupil of mine where, if, before repast, it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace, I will undertake, on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil, your [speaking in foreign language], where I will show those verses to be very unlearned, savoring neither of poetry, wit, nor invention. I beseech your society. And thank you too for society, saith the text, is the happiness of life. I will not love. If I do, hang me, faith, I will not. Oh but her eye. By this light, but for her eye, I would not love her. Yes for her two eyes. Well I do nothing in the world but lie and lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love. And it hath taught me to rhyme and to be melancholy, here's part of my rhyme and here my melancholy. Here comes one with a paper. Ay me! Shot by heaven. So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not to those fresh morning drops upon the rose, as thy eye beams, when their fresh rays have smote the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows. Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright through the transparent bosom of the deep, as doth thy face through tears of mine give light. What, Longaville and reading! Listen, ear. Now in thy likeness, one more fool appear! Ay me, I am forsworn! In love I hope, sweet fellowship in shame! Oh sweet Maria, empress of my love. Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye 'gainst whom the world cannot hold argument, persuade my heart to this false perjury? Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment. A woman I forswore, but I will prove thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee. My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love. Thy grace being gained cures all disgrace in me. Vows are but breath and breath a vapor is. Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine, exhalest this vapor vow in thee it is. If broken then it is no fault of mine. If by me broke, what fool is not so wise to lose an oath to win a paradise. This is the liver-vein which makes flesh a deity, a green goose a goddess. Pure, pure idolatry. By whom shall I send this? Oh! Company! Stay. All hid, all hid. An old infant play. Oh most divine Kate! Oh most profane coxcomb! Oh that I had my wish. And I had mine. And I mine too, good Lord. Amen, so I had mine. Isn't that a good word? Like a fever she reigns in my blood and will remembered be. Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ. Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit. On a day, alack the day! Love, whose month is ever May, spied a blossom passing fair playing in the wanton air. Through the velvet leaves the wind, all unseen, can passage find. That the lover, sick to death, wished himself the heaven's breath. Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow, air would I might triumph so. But alack, my hand is sworn ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn. Vow, alack, for youth unmeet, youth so apt to pluck a sweet. Do not call it sin in me, that I am forsworn for thee. Thou for whom Jove would swear Juno but an Ethiope were. And deny himself for Jove, turning mortal for thy love. This will I send and something else more plain that shall express my true love's fasting pain. Oh would the king, Biron and Longaville were lovers too. Ill to example ill, would from my forehead wipe a perjured note. For none offend where all alike do dote. Dumain. Thy love is far from charity that in love's grief desire a society. Oh you may look pale, but I should blush, I know, to be o'erheard and taken napping so. [clears throat] You blush. That is your case is such. You chide at him, offending twice as much. You do not love Maria. Longaville did never sonnet for her sake compile nor lay his wreathed arms athwart his loving bosom to keep down his heart. I have been closely shrouded in this book and marked you both and at you both did look. I heard your guilty rhymes. Noted well your fashion. Saw sighs reek from you, observed your passion. Ay me, says one. Oh Jove the other cries. One her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes. You would for paradise break faith and troth. And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath. What will Biron say when that he shall hear faith infringed which such zeal did swear. How will he scorn? How will he spend his wit? How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it. For all the wealth that ever I did see, I would not have him know so much by me. Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy. Oh good my liege, I pray thee pardon me. Good heart. What grace hast thou thus to reprove these worms for loving, that art most in love? Your eyes do make no coaches. In your tears there's no certain princess that appears. You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing. Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting! But are you not ashamed? Nay, are you not, all three of you, to be thus much o'ershot? You found his mote, the king your mote did see, but I a beam do find in each of three. What a scene of foolery have I seen. Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen! Oh me, with what strict patience have I sat to see a king transformed to a gnat. To see great Hercules whipping a gig and profound Solomon to tune a jig. And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys and critic Timon laugh at idle toys. Where lies thy grief, oh tell me, good Dumain. And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain. And where my liege is, all about the breast. A caudle, ho! Too bitter is thy jest. Are we betrayed thus to thy overview? Not you by me, but I betrayed by you. I that am honest. I that hold it sin to break the vow I'm engaged in. I am betrayed by keeping company with moon-like men, men of inconstancy. When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme, or groan for Joan or spend a minute's time in pruning me? When shall you hear that I will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye, a gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist, a leg, a limb? Soft, whither away so fast? A true man or a thief that gallops so? I post from love, good lover, let me go. God bless the king! What present hast thou there? Some certain treason. What makes treason here? I beseech your grace, let this letter be read. Our parson misdoubts it, 'twas treason, he said. [Ferdinand] Biron, read it over. Where hadst thou it? [Jaquenetta] Of Costard. Oh hey! [Ferdinand] Now what is in it, why dost tear it? It's a toy my liege, a toy. Your grace needs not fear it. It did move him to passion and therefore let's hear it. It's Biron's writing and here is his name. You were born to do me shame. Guilty my liege, guilty. I confess, I confess. What? That you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess. He, he and you and you my liege and I, are pick-purses in love and we deserve to die. Dismiss this audience, I'll tell you more. Now the number's even. True, true, we are four. Will these turtles be gone? Hence sirs, away. Walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay. [laughing] Sweet lords. Sweet lovers! Oh let us embrace! As true we are as flesh and blood can be. The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face. Young blood cannot obey an old decree. What did these rent lines show some love of thine? [All] Oh! Did they quoth he, who sees the heavenly Rosaline. That like a rude and savage man of Inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east, bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast. What peremptory eagle-sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty? What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now? My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon. She an attending star, scarce seen a light. My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron. Oh but for my love, day would turn to night. Oh 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine. By heaven, thy love is black as ebony. Is ebony like her, oh wood divine. A wife of such wood were felicity. Who can give an oath, where's a book? That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack, if that she learn not of her eye to look. No face is fair that is not full so black. Oh paradox! Black is the badge of hell, the hue of dungeons and the school of night and beauty's crest becomes the heavens well. To look like her are chimney sweepers black. And since her time are colliers counted bright. And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack. Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light. Your mistresses they never come in rain, for fear their color should be washed away. [All] Oh! 'Twere good, yours did for sir to tell you plain, I'll find a fairer face not washed today. I'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here. No devil will fright thee then so much as she. I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear. Look here's thy love. My foot and her face see. Oh if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread. Oh vile! Then as she goes what upward lies the street should see as she walked overhead. But what of this? Are we not all in love? Nothing so sure and therefore all forsworn. Then leave this chat and good Biron now prove our loving lawful and our faith not torn. Ay marry, some flattery for this evil. Oh some authority, how to proceed. Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil. Some salve for perjury. 'Tis more than need. Have at you then, affection's men at arms. Consider what you first did swear unto. To fast, to study and to see no women. Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. Say can you fast? Your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies. But we've made a vow to study, lords, and in that vow we have forsworn our books. For when would you my liege, or you or you, in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty's tutors can enrich you with. Other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practices scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil. But love, first learned in a lady's eyes, lives not alone immured in the brain. But with the motion of all elements, courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above his functions and his offices. It adds a precious seeing to the eye. A lover's eye will gaze an eagle blind. A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound, when suspicious head of theft is stopped. Love's feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails. Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste. For valor, is not love a Hercules still climbing trees in the Hesperides? Subtle as Sphinx, as sweet and musical as bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair. And when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony. Never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were tempered with love's sighs. Oh then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility. From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still the right Promethean fire. They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain and nourish all the world. Else none at all in ought proves excellent. Then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools. For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love, or for love's sake, a word that loves all men. Or for men's sake, the authors of these women, or for women's sake, by whom we men are men. Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves, or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths. It is religion to be thus forsworn, for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity? [applauding] Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field! Advance your standards and upon them, lords pell-mell down with them, but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them. Now to plain dealing. Lay these glozes by. Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France? And win them too! Therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents. First from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress. In the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them. Such as the shortness of the time can shape. For revels, dances, masks and merry hours forerun fair love, strewing her way with flowers. [laughing] [speaking in foreign language] I praise God for you, sir, you are reasons that dinner have been sharp and sententious. Pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without opinion and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nominated or called, Don Adriano de Armado. [speaking in foreign language] His humor is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, his general behavior vain, ridiculous and thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may say. A most singular and choice epithet. He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument. I abhor such fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and point-devise companions. Such rackers of orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should say doubt. Or det when he should pronounce debt, D-E-B-T not D-E-T. He clepeth a calf, cauf. [laughing] Half, hauf. [laughing] Neighbor [speaking in foreign language] nebor. Ne abberviated ni. This is abominable which he would call abbominable. It insinuateth me of [speaking in foreign language], to make frantic, lunatic. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language], a little scratched which we'll serve. [upbeat music] [speaking in foreign language] Men of peace, well encountered. [Holoferness] Most military sir, salutation. Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the rude multitude call the afternoon. The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon. The word is well chosen, culled, sweet and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure. Sir the king is a noble gentleman and my familiar, I do assure ye, very good friend. For what is inward between us, let it pass. But I must tell thee, it will please his grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal finger, thus, dally with my excrement, with my mustachio. But sweetheart, let that pass. By the world I recount no fable. Some certain special honors it pleaseth his greatness to impart to Armado. A soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world. But let that pass. The very all of all is, but sweetheart, I do implore secrecy. The king would have me present the princess, sweet chuck, with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it were, I have acquainted you to the end withal, to crave your assistance. They have been at a great feast of language and stolen the scraps. Oh they have lived long on the alms-basket of words. I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word. Sir you shall present before her the Nine Worthies. So Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by our assistants, at the king's command and this most gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the princess. I say none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies. Where will you find men worthy enough to present them? Joshua yourself, myself, Alexander. This gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus. The swain, by reason of his great limb or joint shall pass Pompey the Great. The page Hercules. Pardon sir, error. He is not quantity for that Worthy's thumb. He is not big enough for the end of his club. Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority. His enter and exit shall be strangling a snake and I will have a prologue to that purpose. An excellent device! Then if any of the audience hiss, you may cry well done Hercules. Now thou crushest the snake! [laughing] For the rest of the Worthies? I will play three myself. Thrice worthy gentleman. [laughing] Shall I tell you a thing? We attend. We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I beseech you, follow. Via goodman Dull thou hast said no word all this time. Nor understood none neither sir. [speaking in foreign language] We will employee thee. I'll make one in a dance or so or I will play on the tabour to the Worthies and let them dance the hay. Most dull honest Dull. To our sport, away! Sweethearts, we shall be rich ere we depart if fairings come thus plentifully in. A lady walled about with diamonds. Look you what I have from the loving king. Madame came nothing else along with that? Nothing but this! Yes, as much love in rhyme as would be crammed up in a sheet of paper, writ o' both sides of the leaf, margent and all, that he was fain to seal on Cupid's name. That were the way to make his godhead wax. For he hath been 5000 year a boy. Ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too. You'll ne'er be friends with him a' killed your sister. He made her melancholy, sad and heavy and so she died. Had she been light, like you, of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit, she might ha' been a grandam ere she died. And so may you for a light heart lives long. What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word? A light condition in a beauty dark. We need more light to find your meaning out. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff, therefore I'll darkly end the argument. See what you you do, you do it still in the dark. So do not you, for you are a light wench. I weigh not you and therefore light. You weigh me not? Oh that's you care not for me. Great reason. For past cure is still past care. Well bandied both. A set of wit well played. But Rosaline, you have a favor too. Who sent it? And what is it? I would you knew. An if my face were but as fair as yours my favor were as great. Be witness this. Nay I have verses too, I thank Biron. The numbers true and were the numbering too I were the fairest goddess on the ground. I am compared to 20,000 fairs. Oh he hath drawn my picture in his letter. Anything like? Much in the letters, nothing in the praise. Beauteous as ink, a good conclusion. But Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain? Madam this glove. Did he not send you twain? Yes madam. And moreover some thousand verses of a faithful lover. A huge translation of hypocrisy vilely compiled. Profound simplicity. This and these pearls to me sent Longaville. The letter is too long by half a mile. I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart the chain were longer and the letter short? Ay or I would these hands might never part. We are wise girls to mock our lovers so. They are worse fools to purchase mocking so. That same Biron, I'll torture ere I go. Oh that I knew he were but in by the week. How I would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the seasons and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests. And make him proud to make me proud that jests. So pertinent-like would I o'er sway his state that he should be my fool and I his fate. None are so surely caught when they are catched, as wit turned fool. Folly, in wisdom hatched, hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school and wit's own grace to grace a learned fool. The blood of youth burns not with such success as gravity's revolt to wantonness. I'm stabbed with laughter. Where's her grace? [Princess] Thy news Boyet? Prepare madam, prepare! Arm, wenches, arm. Encounters mounted are against your peace. Love doth approach disguised, armed in arguments. You'll be surprised. Muster your wits, stand in your own defense or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence. Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they that charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say. Under the cool shade of a sycamore I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour when lo, to interrupt my purposed rest toward that shade I might behold addressed the king and his companions. Warily I stole into a neighbor thicket by and overheard what you shall overhear, that by and by disguised they will be here. What? But what, come they to visit us. They do, they do and are appareled thus like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess. Their purpose is to parle, court and dance and everyone his love-feat will advance unto his several mistress, which they'll know by favors several which they did bestow. And will they so? The gallants shall be tasked for ladies we will every one be masked. And not a man of them shall have the grace, despite of suit, to see a lady's face. Hold Rosaline, this favor shalt thou wear and then the king will court thee for his dear. Hold, take thou this my sweet and give me thine. So shall Biron take me for Rosaline. And change your favors too. So shall your loves woo contrary, deceived by these removes. Come on then. Wear the favors most in sight. But in this changing what is your intent? The effect of my intent is to cross theirs. They do it but in mocking merriment. And mock for mock is only my intent. Their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook, and so be mocked withal upon the next occasion that we meet, with visages displayed, to talk and greet. But shall we dance if they desire us to it? No, to the death we shall not move a foot. Nor to their penned speech render we no grace. But while it is spoke each turn away her face. Why that contempt will kill the speaker's heart and quite divorce his memory from his part. Therefore I do it and I make no doubt the rest will ne'er come in, if he be out. There's no such sport as sport by sport or thrown, to make theirs ours and ours none but our own. So shall we stay, mocking intended game, and they, well mocked, depart away with shame. [trumpets sounding] The trumpet sounds. Be masked, the maskers come. [tense music] ♪ All hail, the richest beauties on the earth ♪ ♪ A wholly parcel of the fairest dames ♪ ♪ That ever turned backs on mortal views ♪ [Biron] Their eyes, villain, their eyes! ♪ That ever turned their eyes on mortal views ♪ Out. True, out indeed. [Rosaline] Boyet what would these strangers know their minds. If they do speak our language, 'tis our will that some plain man recount their purposes. Know what they would. What would you with the princess? [Biron] Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. [Rosaline] What would they, say they? Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. [Rosaline] Why that they have and bid them so be gone. She says you have it and you may be gone. [Ferdinand] Say to her we have measured many miles to tread a measure with her on this grass. They say they have measured many a mile to tread a measure with you on this grass. [Rosaline] It is not so. Ask them how many inches is in one mile if they have measured many. The measure then of one is easily told. If to come hither you have measured miles and many miles, the princess bids you tell how many inches doth fill up one mile. [Biron] Tell her we measure them by weary steps. She hears herself. [Rosaline] How many weary steps of many weary miles you have o'er gone are numbered in the travel of one mile? [Biron] We number nothing that we spend for you. Our duty is so rich, so infinite, that we may do it still without account. Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face, that we, like savages, may worship it. [Rosaline] My face is but a moon and clouded too. [Ferdinand] Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do. Vouchsafe, bright moon and these thy stars, to shine. Those clouds removed upon our watery eyne. [Rosaline] Oh vain petitioner! Beg a greater matter. Thou now requests but moonshine in the water. [Ferdinand] Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change. Thou bid'st me beg, this begging is not strange. [Rosaline] Play music, then! Nay, you must do it soon. Not yet! No dance! Thus change I like the moon. [Ferdinand] Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged? [Rosaline] You took the moon at full but now she's changed. [Ferdinand] Yet still she is the moon and I the man. The music plays. Vouchsafe some motion to it. [Rosaline] Our ears vouchsafe it. [Ferdinand] But your legs should do it. [Rosaline] Since you are strangers and come here by chance, we'll not be nice. Take hands. We will not dance. [Ferdinand] If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat. [Rosaline] In private, then. [Ferdinand] I am best pleased with that. [Biron] White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee. Honey and milk and sugar, there are three. [Biron] Nay then, two treys and if you grow so nice, metheglin, wort and malmsey. Well run, dice, there's half-a-dozen sweets. Seventh sweet, adieu. Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you. [Biron] One word in secret. Let it not be sweet. [Biron] Thou grievest my gall. Gall! Bitter. [Biron] Therefore meet. [Dumain] Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word? [Maria] Name it. [Dumain] Fair lady. [Maria] Say you so? Fair lord take that for your fair lady. [Dumain] Please it you as much in private and I'll bid adieu. [Katharine] What, was your vizard made without a tongue? [Longaville] I know the reason, lady, why you ask. [Katharine] Oh for your reason, quickly sir, I long. [Longaville] You have a double tongue within your mask, and would afford my speechless vizard half. [Katharine] Veal quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf? [Longaville] A calf, fair lady? [Katharine] No a fair lord calf. [Longaville] Let's part the word. [Katharine] No I'll not be your half. Take all and wean it, it may prove an ox. [Longaville] Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks! Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so. [Katharine] Then die a calf before your horns do grow. [Longaville] A word in private with you, ere I die. [Katharine] Bleat softly then, the butcher hears you cry. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen as is the razor's edge invisible. Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen above the sense of sense. So sensible seemeth their conference. Their conceits have wings. Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things. [Rosaline] Not one word more. My maids break off, break off. [Biron] By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff! [Ferdinand] Farewell mad wenches, you have simple wits. 20 adieus, my frozen Muscovites. [laughing] Are these the breed of wits so wondered at? Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed out. Well-liking wits they have, gross, gross, fat, fat. Oh poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout! Will they not think you hang themselves tonight? Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces? This pert Biron was out of countenance quite. They were all lamentable cases. The king was weeping ripe for a good word. Biron did swear himself out of all suit. Dumain was at my service and his sword. No point, quoth I, my servant straight was mute. Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart and trow you what he called me. Qualm perhaps. Yes! [laughing] Go sickness as thou art! Well better wits have worn plain statute caps. But will you hear? The king is my love sworn. And quick Biron hath plighted troth to me. And Longaville was for my service born. Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree. Madam and pretty mistresses, give ear. Immediately they will again be here in their own shapes, for it can never be they will digest this harsh indignity. Will they return? They will, they will, God knows, and leap for joy, though they are lame with blows. Therefore change favors and when they repair blow like sweet roses in this summer air. What shall we do if they return in their own shapes to woo? Good madam, if by me you'll be advised. Let's mock them still as well known as disguised. Let us complain to them what fools were here disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear. And wonder what they were and to what end their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess? Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty command me any service to her there? That she vouchsafe me audience for one word. I will and so will she, I know, my lord. This fellow pecks up wit as pigeon's pease and utters it again when God doth please. He's wit's peddler and retails his wares at wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs. And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know, have not the grace to grace it with such show. This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice, that when he plays at tables, chides the dice in honorable terms. Oh he can sing mean, most meanly and in ushering mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet. The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet. This is the flower that smiles on everyone to show his teeth as white as whale's bone. And consciences that will not die in debt give him the due of honey-tongued Boyet. A blister on his sweet tongue with my heart, that put Armado's page out of his part. See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou till this man showed thee and what art thou now? All hail sweet madam and fair time of day! Fair in all hail is foul, as I conceive. Construe my speeches better, if you may. Then wish me better, I will give you leave. We came to visit you and purpose now to lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it then. This field shall hold me and so hold your vow. Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men. Rebuke me not for that which you provoke. The virtue of your eye must break my oath. You nickname virtue, vice you should have spoke. For virtue's office never breaks men's troth. Now by my maiden honor, yet as pure as the unsullied lily, I protest. A world of torment though I should endure, I would not yield to be your house's guest. So much I hate a breaking cause to be of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity. Oh you have lived in desolation here. Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame. Not so, my lord. It is not so, I swear. We have had pastimes here and pleasant game. A mess of Russians left us but of late. How madam, Russians. Ay in truth, my lord, trim gallants, full of courtship and of state. Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord. My lady, to the manner of the days, in courtesy gives undeserving praise. We four indeed confronted were with four in Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour and talked apace and in that hour, my lord, they did not bless us with one happy word. I dare not call them fools but this I think. When fools are thirsty they would fain have drink. This jest is dry to me, fair gentle sweet. Your wit makes wise things foolish. When we greet with eyes best seeing heaven's fiery eye, by light we lose light. Your capacity is of that nature that to your huge store wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor. This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-- I'm a fool and full of poverty. But that you take what doth to you belong, It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue. Oh I'm yours and all that I possess! All the fool mine? I cannot give you less. Which of the vizards was it that you wore? Where, when? What vizard, why demand you this? There, then, that vizard, that superfluous case that hid the worse and showed the better face. We are descried, they'll mock us now downright. Let us confess and turn it to a jest. Amazed, my lord? Why looks your highness sad? Help, hold his brows or he'll swoon. Why look you pale? Seasick I think, coming from Muscovy. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury. Can any face of brass hold longer out? Here stand I, lady, dart thy skill at me. Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout, thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance. Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit. And I will wish thee never more to dance, nor never more in Russian habit wait. Oh never will I trust to speeches penned nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue. Nor come in vizard to my friend, nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song! Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise. Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation. Figures pedantical. These summer flies have blown me full of maggot ostentation. I do forswear them and I here protest. By this white glove, how white the hand God knows, henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed in russet yeas and honest kersey noes. And to begin. Wench, so God help me long, my love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw. Sans sans, I pray you. Yet have a trick of the old rage. Bear with me, I'm sick, I'll leave it by degrees. These lords are visited. You're not free for the Lord's tokens on you do I see. No they are free that gave these tokens to us. Our states are forfeit, seek not to undo us. It is not so, for how can this be true that you stand forfeit, being those that sue. Peace, for I will not have to do with you. Nor shall not if I do as I intend. Speak for yourselves, my wit is at an end. Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression, some fair excuse. The fairest is confession. Were not you here but even now disguised? Madam, I was. And were you well advised? I was, fair madam. When you then were here, what did you whisper in your lady's ear? [Ferdinand] That more than all the world I did respect her. When she shall challenge this, you will reject her. [Ferdinand] Upon my honor, no. Peace, peace, forbear. Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear. [Ferdinand] Despise me when I break this oath of mine. I will and therefore keep it. Rosaline. What did the Russian whisper in your ear? Madam he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight and did value me above this world, adding thereto moreover, that he would wed me, or else die my lover. God give thee joy of him! The noble lord most honorably doth keep his word. What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth, I never made this lady such an oath. By heaven you did and to confirm it plain you gave me this. But take it sir, again. My faith and this the princess I did give. I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve. Pardon me sir, this jewel did she wear. And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear. What will you have me or your pearl again? Neither of either, I remit both twain. [laughing] I see the trick on't. Here was a consent, knowing aforehand of our merriment. The ladies did change favors and then we, following the signs, wooed but the signs of she. And now to our perjury to add more terror, we're again forsworn in will and error. Much upon this it is and might not you forestall our sport to make us thus untrue. Full merrily hath this brave marriage, this career, been run. Lo he's tilting straight! Peace, I've done. [drum banging] Welcome, pure wit! Thank you. Thou partest a fair fray. Oh Lord sir, they would know whether the three Worthies shall come in or no. Yes go bid them prepare. We will turn it finely off, sir. We will take some care. Biron they will shame us, let them not approach. We're shame-proof, my lord. And tis some policy to have one show worse than the king's and his company. I say they shall not come in. Nay my good lord, let me o'er rule you now. That sport best pleases that doth least know how. Where zeal strives to content and the contents dies in the zeal of that which it presents. Their form confounded makes most form in mirth, where great things laboring perish in their birth. A right description of our sport, my lord. Anointed, I implore so much of your royal sweet breath that would utter a brace of words. Doth this man serve God? [Biron] Why ask you? He speaks not like a man of God's making. That is all one my fair, sweet, honey monarch for I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical too, too vain. Too too vain! But I will put it down, as they say, to [speaking in foreign language]. I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement! Here is like to be a goodly presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of Troy. The swain, Pompey the Great. The parish curate, Alexander. Armado's page Hercules and the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus. [applauding] I Pompey am. You lie, you're not he. I Pompey am. With libbard's head on knee. Well said old mocker, I must needs be friends with thee. I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big. The Great. [laughing] It is Great, sir. Pompey surnamed the Great. That oft in field with targe and shield did make my foe to sweat. And traveling along this coast, I here am come by chance. And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France. [applauding] If your ladyship would say thanks Pompey, I had done. Great thanks, Great Pompey. 'Tis not so much worth but I hope I was perfect. I made a little fault in Great. No no no no. My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy. [gentle music] [audience applauding] When in the world I lived, I was the world's commander. [Man] Louder! By east, by west, by north, south, I spread my conquering might. My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander. Your nose says no you're not for it stands too right. [Man] Your nose smells no in this most tender smelling knight. The conqueror is dismayed. Proceed, good Alexander. When in the world I lived, I was the world's commander. [Boyet] Most true 'tis right, you were so, Alisander. [Biron] Pompey the Great! Your servant and Costard. Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander. Oh sir, you've overthrown Alisander the Conqueror! A conqueror with a fear to speak. Run away for shame, Alisander. There it shall please you, a foolish mild man. An honest man, look you and soon dashed. He's a marvelous good neighbor, faith and a very good bowler. But for Alisander, alas, you see how it is. A little o'er parted. But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort. Stand aside good Pompey. [applauding] Great Hercules is presented by this imp, whose club killed Cerberus, the three-headed canis. And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp, thus did he strangle serpents in his manus. [Audience] Oh! [speaking in foreign language] He seemeth in minority, ergo I come with this apology. [audience applauding] Keep some state in thy exit and vanish. [laughing] I Judas am. A Judas! Not Iscariot, sir. Judas yclept Maccabaeus. Oh Judas Maccabaeus yclept is plain Judas. I Judas am. The more shame for you, Judas. What mean you, sir? To make Judas hang himself. Begin sir, you are my elder. Well followed, Judas was hanged on an elder. I will not be put out of countenance. Because thou hast no face. What is this? [Boyet] A cittern-head? [Dumain] The head of a bodkin. [Biron] A death's face in a ring. The face of an old Roman coin scarce seen. Forward for we've put thee in countenance. You've put me out of countenance. False, we have given thee faces. But you've out-faced them all. And thou wert a lion, we would do so. Therefore as he is an ass let him go. And so adieu, sweet Jude! Nay, why dost thou stay? [Dumain] For the latter end of his name. [Biron] For the ass to the Jude give it him. Jud-ass, away! This is not generous, not gentle, not humble. A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark, he may stumble. Alas poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited! Hide thy head, Achilles. Here comes Hector in arms. [Boyet] But is this Hector? [Ferdinand] I think Hector was not so clean-timbered. [Longaville] His leg is too big for Hector's. [Dumain] More calf, certain. No he's best endued in the small. [laughing] This cannot be Hector. He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces. The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, gave Hector a gift. A gilt nutmeg. A lemon. Stuck with cloves. No no no, cloven. Peace! The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion. A man so breathed that certain he would fight yea from morn till night from out of his pavilion. I am that flower. That mint. That columbine. Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue. I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector. Ay and Hector's a greyhound. [laughing] The sweet war man is dead and rotten. Sweet chucks beat not the bones of the buried. When he breathed he was a man. But I will forward with my device. Sweet royalty, bestow on me the benefit of hearing. Oh speak, brave Hector. We are much delighted. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal. The party is gone-- Fellow Hector. She is gone. She is two months on her way. What says thou? Faith unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench is cast away. She's quick. The child brags in her belly already. Tis yours. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die! Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by him. [Dumain] Most rare Pompey! Renowned Pompey! [Biron] Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey! Pompey the Huge! [Dumain] Hector trembles. By the north pole, I challenge thee. I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man. I'll slash, I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you, let me borrow my arms again. [Dumain] Room for the incensed Worthies! I'll do it in my shirt. [Dumain] Most resolute Pompey! Master let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean you? You'll lose your reputation. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me. I will not combat in my shirt. Oh what reason has thou for it? The naked truth of it is I have no shirt. I go woolward for penance. [laughing] God save you, madam! Welcome Mercade but that thou interrupt'st our merriment. I am sorry madam for the news I bring is heavy in my tongue. The king your father. Dead for my life. Even so. My tale is told. [Biron] Worthies, away! The scene begins to cloud. For mine own part I breathe free breath. I've seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and I will right myself like a soldier. How fares your majesty? Boyet, prepare. I will away tonight. Madam not so. I do beseech you, stay. Prepare I say. I thank you, gracious lords for all your fair endeavors. And entreat out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits. If over-boldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord. A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue. Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtained. The extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate. And though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince, yet since love's argument was first on foot let not the cloud of sorrow justle it from what it purposed, since to wail friends lost is not by much so wholesome profitable as to rejoice at friends but newly found. I understand you not. My griefs are double. Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief. For your fair sakes have we neglected time, played foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies, hath much deformed us, fashioning our humors even to the opposed end of our intents. And what in us hath seemed ridiculous. As love is full of unbefitting strains, all wanton as a child, skipping and vain. Formed by the eye and therefore, like the eye, full of strange shapes of habits and of forms. Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll to every varied object in its glance. Which party-coated presence of loose love put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes, have misbecomed our oaths and gravities, those heavenly eyes that looked into these faults suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies, our love being yours, the error that love makes, is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false by being once false for ever to be true to those that make us both. Fair ladies, you. We have received your letters full of love. Your favors, the ambassadors of love. And in our maiden council rated them for courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy, as bombast and as lining to the time. But more devout than this in our respects have we not been. And therefore met your loves in their own fashion, like a merriment. Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest. So did our looks. We did not quote them so. Now, at the latest minute of the hour, grant us your loves. A time, methinks, too short to make a world-without-end bargain in. No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much. Full of dear guiltiness and therefore this. If for my love, as there is no such cause, you will do aught, this shall you do for me. Your oath I will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage, remote from all the pleasures of the world. There stay until the 12 celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning. If this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood. If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love, but that it bear this trial and last love, then, at the expiration of the year, come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts. And by this virgin palm now kissing thine I will be thine. And till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mourning house, raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father's death. If this thou do deny, let our hands part. Neither entitled in the other's heart. If this, or more than this, I would deny, to flatter up these powers of mine with rest. The sudden hand of death close up mine eye. Hence hermit then. My heart is in thy breast. But what to me, my love? But what to me? A wife? A beard, fair health and honesty. With three-fold love I wish you all these three. Oh shall I say I thank you, gentle wife? Not so, my lord. A 12 month and a day I'll mark no words that smooth faced wooers say. Come when the king doth to my lady come, then, if I have much love, I'll give you some. I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then. Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again. [Longaville] What says Maria? At the 12 month end I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend. Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me. Behold the window of my heart, mine eye. What humble suit attends thy answer there. Impose some service on me for thy love. Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron, before I saw you. And the world's large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks, full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you on all estates will execute that come within the mercy of your wit. To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain and therewithal to win me, if you please, without the which I am not to be won, you shall this 12 month term from day-to-day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches. And your task shall be, with all the fierce endeavor of your wit, to enforce the pained impotent to smile. To move wild laughter in the throat of death? It cannot be, it's impossible. Mirth cannot move a soul in agony. Why that's the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools. A jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it, never in the tongue of him that makes it. Then if sickly ears, deaf to the clamors of their own dear groans, will hear your idle scorns, continue then. And I will have you and that fault withal. But if they will not, throw away that spirit and I shall find you empty of that fault, right joyful of your reformation. A 12 month. Well befall what will befall. I'll jest a 12 month in a hospital. And so I take my leave. No madam, we will bring you on your way. Our wooing doth not end like an old play. Jack hath not Jill. These ladies' courtesy might well have made our sport a comedy. [Ferdinand] Come sir. It wants a 12 month and a day and then 'twill end. That's too long for a play. [Don] Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me. [Princess] Was not that Hector? [Dumain] The worthy knight of Troy. I will kiss thy royal finger and take leave. I am a votary. I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plow for her sweet love three years. But most esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed at the end of our show. [Ferdinand] Call them forth quickly, we will do so.
