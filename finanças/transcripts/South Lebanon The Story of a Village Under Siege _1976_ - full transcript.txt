I said we were helping Mr Tian fix his house Report to the 4th Squad Leader: The puppet troops in Jiangqiao are coming to loot the grain! The company ordered us to assemble at the entrance of the village Sister, what should we do? It's nothing serious Only a few Japs Ha, they delivered themselves to our home Quick!

No, nothing wrong Li, isn't there a surgeon in the Army? Why not go see the doctor? I've already seen the doctor It's not serious I'll be all right tomorrow Battle must be horrible Facing the enemy, there is nothing to fear? Do woman soldiers also fight in the war? Women don't fight, they work in the hospitals of the home front or in the bedding and clothing factories, looking after the wounded, or making clothes and shoes I can make clothes and shoes too The New Fourth Army stresses the equality of men and women Equality? Can I be equal with men, too? Plant rice seedlings, lift water, make clothes and pull weeds, even go to the front Li, can I join you? But we'll go far, far away I'll follow you, wherever you go I've come to get some grenades Squad leader's orders Why make a face? Nothing special here Don't spread rumors, Xiao Ma! It is obvious Before Xiao Ma burst into the room, Li Jin was already there, chatting with her I've also kept an eye on them, They really act unusual How? Just different from what's usual But I said nothing Did anything happen? Not yet I found that they have feelings in their hearts, but dare not do anything when facing each other Even that will make the whole squad unsettled Well, tell him to come here Nothing is better than being handsome Look! Er Meizi's eyes, are stuck on Li Don't blab! Any slip could have terrible consequences Has he disrupted military discipline? It's the local people who disrupted our discipline! He Jinbiao! What are you talking about! Nothing, company commander Don't talk behind others' back Company commander You are making a mistake Li, the instructor wants you In fact it's really a surprise to me Li, the squad leader, is still a child in my mind When hejoined the army secretly three years ago, he wasn't as tall as a rifie With a round face and a coat covered with dust, he looked so perky with his little gun Others would say: What a big guy! During three years, he won a dozen battles and hasjoin the Party I'd never imagined he would have anything incorrect in his mind But now, what on earth are you thinking of? What are you doing these days, with the girl of the family you're staying with? Instructor, I'll give you a full report She asked me to find out if she canjoin our Army Join the Army? You are recruiting new soldiers! Well, just tell me, when you were having a rest at home yesterday, what did she say to you in your room? To be frank, instructor, I would like to talk with her, but I don't know what to say... Didn't the instructor get angry with Li? No You are always on the side of Li, Xiao Ma Would I have reported if I was partial to Li? And then? And then Xiao Ma burst in She said she wanted to go with us, wherever we go What's your opinion then? I... I definitely want her tojoin us Instructor, I admit that I like her How can you do that! You certainly know that these kinds of nasty affairs are likely to disrupted the military discipline Instructor, that can't be called a nasty affair! I don't think like that I'm serious and in a formal way Yes Can't love be a serious thing? Can't young soldiers fall in love? But you are a New Fourth Army soldier, while she's common people How can you support her? But weren't we told to crush Hitler this year, and then the Japanese invaders next year? So your plan is to get to know her first, and then marry her after our victory? You got it It would be best if she couldjoin the army But, it doesn't matter if she can't After the war, if I stay in the Army, I will ask for leave to bring her back She's very capable She can plant rice seedlings and weed On her deathbed, my mother asked me to find a wifejust like her Have you ever told her that? No It doesn't matter even if I'd told her I might die on the battlefield If so, it would be a great loss for her It might not work for the local people here Feudalism remains in their minds They will be against us Now you fall in love If everybody follow suit, what will our company like? How can we drive offJaps next year? Before you, I think that such things are not permitted But once I come bake, living in her family, I would feel uneasy Well, I will discuss it with our company commander Sister, they are leaving! They're going east Comrade Ma, are you leaving? No, we'rejust moving, changing over with other company Is everything ready? Yes Are you the instructor? Yes You are the best How's that? Li told me that You two are best friends You are brave when fighting Don't disturb the instructor, Niuniu! He's working Grandpa, have we done anything wrong? Not at all! You have given us so much help! How much land is there for you to cultivate? About 5 mu Yours? No It has long been Landlord Wang's, and I have to work for him Is he the one in this village? Yes Isn't he out? Where has he gone? I don't know, actually What is he like? He is... OK Niuniu! Where is that naughty boy? Commander Hey, grandpa! What's on? That old chap is overcautious I want to know about Landlord Wang, but he did not dare tell Don't be rash Instructor, will you stay here for long? I know whether we'll leave or stay, but I won't tell you Tell me! You little spy, tell me first: Who sent you here? Then I'll tell you No You first, then I'll tell you who I can guess, even if you don't tell me You can't! What if I'm right? What if you're wrong? You can beat my palms ten times And if I guess right? I won't beat you Just scrape your little nose three times If you can't, I will scrape your big nose three times! Well, I'll guess now It's your grandpa who sent you here Three big noses! Then who told you to come here? My second sister She also wanted me to ask you, can the New Fourth Army soldiers get married? but later she stopped me from asking that We obey orders from higher-ups They tell us whether to withdraw or to stay Marriage is not allowed now We arefighting the Japs You know how bad they are and the puppet army are I hate them No, I won't marry You have to Grandpa, have any of us offended you? Just tell me and I'll deal with it Cheer up, grandpa Go back home and have a good rest Leave the problem for tomorrow I guess there must be something wrong Some big thing Did Li do something wrong? It couldn't be He never lies to me Then what happened? Grandpa Father is out Where did he go? To plant rice for the landlord Why? That's odd Something seemed to have happened this morning Hi, come in Li, after dinner, go to the east of the bridge My sister will be waiting for you there She has something to say to you You have to go I see Don't tell anyone Xiao Niu, I won't go Go to meet her!

Er Meizi lost her mother when she ws very young He has a nickname, Beard Liu Her elder sister died because of him He's a dirty scoundrel He was once a platoon leader in the central army When the Japanese came, he became a puppet soldier Beard Liu was promoted to squadron leader Now he lives in our village Before we came here, he came back to Liubao Your elder daughter didn't have good fortune But your son-in-law won't forget you You are still my father-in-law I hear that Er Merzi has grown up and is even prettier than her sister Then let her has the fortune Mr Liu, we are too poor to have that fortune She's still a little girl Will you ask her to come out?

No The New Fourth Army has arrived in East Village Hide yourself quickly Quick, Dad Landlord, he's hidden his daughter Don't be forced to do what you have already refused Next time Liu will welcome her with his guns Landlord, I just sent her to her uncle's to hide Listen, the New Fourth Army isjust like a shower in summer, which comes with great power but goes quickly If you are on their side, all your family will be executed when Beard Liu comes You are here now They said you would withdraw You can't go Once you leave they'll be back Then I will die Li, won't you save us? We're in mortal danger Comrades, I was so stupid Yesterday I heard all this from her, and feel such deep regret The villagers are suffering a lot, but I was thinking of myself How can this be called a revolution? I won't say high-sounding words now, but I will prove my determination by my behavior I request the higher-ups to save her Let me speak Li, I often speak ill of you and destroyed your reputation I feel so sorry and even more sorry for Er Meizi Instructor, please let Er Meizijoin the army Yes, instructor Let her leave with us!

It there any other way out? There is a way Fight Fight in Jiangqiao Yes If we really fight, it's not a matter of a company or a battalion nor it's only for Er Meizi Instructor, we are not only for Jiangqiao I will report to the commissar on the matter of Liubao We should perfect our skills Don't forget all over China, thousands of Er Meizis are suffering Instructor, Grandpa Tian fainted Instructor, you are back? Grandpa, have a rest Commander, you can't recruit Er Meizi! Beard Liu said if shejoined you, he would kill Niu Niu So do you have the heart to hurt her? What are you afraid here?

Look, this arm was broken by an older member of the Wang family Till now, this has not been avenged Every one of our poor fellows in Liubao has been bullied by the traitors Folks, don't worry We will solve the problem in Liubao How's it going? All has been reported The political commissar happened to be there He asked me to collect more evidence, to educate the army He also said we have many chances to fight And don't worry about love you are still young So what are we going to do? I guess we'll fight for Jiangqiao soon The battalion commander has asked me to go to Ximazhuang I see The day before yesterday, he told me to get familiar with the terrain ofJiangqiao Is it possible that we will be the main attack force? We'll know later We're also been asked to take the mission When do we move? It's an urgent mission Maybe tonight The army is pressing forward It seems that the enemy dare not come but you should still watch out, and report as soon as anything happens Ok Good-bye, instructor Where is your sister? I don't know So we left Liubao like this We moved very quickly I watched Lijin to see if he would look back But he didn't While I couldn't help looking back It's a good chance When New Fourth Army withdrews from Liubao, you can move all the treasures in your homes to Liubao It's safe here Some grain is no big deal I will send you Er Meizi for sure You've done a lot this time That's all right Proper preparations should be made When the Japanese come to our village, I would appreciate your help That's for sure Food talks I will certainly protect you then Ok, have a goodjourney!

She made them but gave them to nobody Just put them here Xiao Ma, let's go to the meeting What are those picks for? What for? There aren't any mountains or stones here And raincoats So many bullets? It's mountainous in the South, and it often rains A great counterattack is coming Huge battles for the cities We'll teach the Japs a big lesson We can fight along the railways, instead of the rivers I don't even know what railway looks like It's a bright spring day, the 18-year-old young man tells his lover, I'm going far, far away, and won't be back for two or three years It might be dangerous in the war I will meet you when we are victorous No one can tell whether we can come back here or not The army will go south Lijin was not so calm He has certainly heard the news We may never come back after we leave We have fought bravely all these years, creeping in the mud, bleeding, keep fighting in the burning house All the difficulties never troubled him But now it's really a problem Morning, instructor What are you doing so early in the morning? Instructor, when are we leaving? Leave? Where? I can tell we are leaving for a place far away But you can be sure that I won't turn back You have thought of turning back? Yes Can I stay? Can I stay in this place? Where has your determination gone? No, that's the truth But since I saved her in the boat, and then we had the victory in Jiangqiao, I've come around I didn't let the fellow villagers down I know she loves me too And I even know... I'll say no more, or I'll be sad How I wish to see her again What's wrong with me? OK, I'll never mention that any more Instructor, please go back I'm all right Don't you believe me? You taught me a lot these years I thought it over for a long time, over and over If I remain here to work, I'll be a deserter What a shame! Instructor, I feel sad when I miss her, but I can stand it If I left the army, and was abandoned by the Party, I would rather die! When I joined the Party, I made the oath that I'd struggle to my death for the people When the people need you to bleed for them, you do it without hesitation; When they need you to put personal affairs aside, I believe you'll also do that Instructor, do you believe me? I believe you We began our expedition soon after The Japanese invaders collapsed So were the reactionaries Today we returned to the old place Commander Li... Director Ahead is the place where we caught Landlord Wang Do you still miss Er Meizi? The war continued for years The situation was tense in this region Even if she's still alive, maybe she has already... That's also good I met someone today It's her district political commissar, not her She said that Tian xueying, that's the name of Er Meizi, has been a Party member for a while and is a cadre now In cruel battles years before, She also fought in the guerilla war on the river She's always been waiting for you Director, can I go now? Why are you so shy today? We've agreed you can go to Liubao Go see her Comrade, where are you going? Can you tell me... You've been here before? Yes You are deputy squad leader Li Are you looking for Tian xueying? Great! You two can reunite at last! Go and find her! No, I can recognize her home Home? It's gone Why? Where are Grandpa Tian and Xiao Niu? The reactionaries wanted to kill them, We've already moved them to the central district Only Er Meizi keeps working here She's the leader of our boat team Go, go and find her Comrade... Li... Comrade Tian xueying It's a bright spring day, The 18-year-old young man listens to his lover, No matter how far away you go, No matter how long you're away, As long as you don't forget me, As long as you return in triumph...
