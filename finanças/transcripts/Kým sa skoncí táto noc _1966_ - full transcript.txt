Kým sa skoncí táto noc (1966) Come in, please. The Slovak Film Institute presents BEFORE TONIGHT IS OVER What would you like to have, Mr Kvetinka? Ms Betka, what's my estimated worth in your view today? Nine-fifty. In that case, one vodka with soda, please. On the rocks! Just you wait! Bastard... Oh, hi Miloš. I always find you in the company of women. So, try it. Does it work? It should last an hour. Get me a seat over there. Thanks. - What a spectacular show! - Nitra, dear Nitra... - What did you say? - Ancient relics... How much is it, Ms Betka? I'm struggling to figure it out. Either I pay or I leave. But no money to pay the surcharge again? Let those ancient relics pay. Why are you talking such nonsense? Why nonsense? Who's an ancient relic here? - Today somebody is going to die. - Don't scare me. Don't believe it? Let's make a bet. Let's say, a bottle of vodka. Then you'll knock somebody on the head just to win! What a delight! - Here you are. - I'm paying. - Maître d'! - How can I help you? Something for the musicians. But only after the dance. May they drink to my health. - But after the dance, okay? - After the dance, sir. 147.20 Here you are. Keep the change. Thank you very much. Bye! Pardon? You're not getting rid of me so easily. Just wanted to settle for now. You wrote 5 korunas more! It's possible. I'll give you back the difference. No need. It's all right. And give me a nice glass. Which one, this one? This one is a bit... I like the belly-shaped one. Let's see. I thought it looked different. And how about you, do you like it? Quite so. Fill it up with something, then. What would you like to have? - Are you serious? - And we'll be all square. All right. Wait a moment! Ms Betka, two glasses please! - So, who'll die? Come on! - Relax, for God's sake. All right, sit down here. - Of what? Vodkas? - Yeah. You said that today somebody... You had someone particular in mind or what? Just a tiny bit of information. Am I somehow involved? Say something! You're too nosy. Did you have somebody in mind, or shall I pick the person? You... I'll get you out of this bad mood. That's a nice kind of disorder, it is. Nice to see you! Miloš! This vodka is real nice, order one more. Which ones? Those ones? Wow, just look there! I really mean it, order another. So finish this one and let's go. Look, I've just spotted somebody. Come on, turn around. Won't you do me a favour? I'll do you this favour so you don't say I'm not your friend. What do you think? They'd be worth dying for, wouldn't they? Aren't they pretty? I've taken a real liking to them. They look Polish. I can tell by the slim heels. Pal'ko, what have you used for flambéing at table 3? Gin. So, shall we give it a try? Your treat? Bye bye, my friend! Going to get a little sleep. You're afraid, because they're foreigners. No reason to be afraid, no big deal. You go to their table, say a few words in Polish... Remember the Turk? Hailá, wasn't it? You woke up in a garage... but these Polish are worth trying! But then I had 100 korunas. Look, I've got some money... I'll pay for it, you do the rest. Remember, you arrange it, but involve me as well. Wait... That's hard-earned money! - A bet or not? - I do, I believe you. So 50 korunas on the Polish. Don't forget about tomorrow. And I'm waiting for all those... May I have a dance? Excuse me, I was asking you for a dance in Polish. It's okay. - Aren't you Polish? - Do I look like one? Yes. Exactly like the girls pictured in Polish magazines. I have several such issues at home. - Anything else? - No, my apologies. I just wanted to have some fun. Could you raise your right hand, please? - I beg your pardon? - Lift your right hand. A bit lower. Thank you, you've got a very well made suit. Is that so? You like it? - Join us at the table, please. - So kind of you. Thank you. - Enjoying ourselves. - Enjoying ourselves. Here you are. You are so attentive. Thank you. Now allow me to make a toast to your health. See, Kvetinka really has the gift. I've seen him drinking with both a garbage man and a minister. A German came here once, they talked about lace... Slovak lace, I think it was... - And what did he discuss with you? - Who else but the minister... - Who else but the minister? - One day you'll master it. - Cheers. - Cheers. What's wrong with you? Nothing, I'll see you off. How does it feel to be up here in our highest mountains? Fine. - How long are you staying? - Five days. - One week? - Five days! Isn't that the same? Not to us. - You're staying with family? - At the Grand Hotel! It must cost at least 60 or 70 korunas a day! Maybe for a double room. Each of us has a single room. The rooms are very nice. Antlers on the walls? For God's sake. What? Antlers? We have a superb bathroom, telephone, TV and all the rest. I have a pale blue bathroom. It's lovely. And on the top of that we have a beautiful view of the mountains. Aren't you jealous? Not to offend either of you... Pick one or the other, Let's toss a coin. - Tails? - Heads. Heads... tails. Heads. - Well done. - Thank you. Now I know. Seems that daddy is at the Ministry. Wrong. Take another guess. You won the lottery? 28, 30, 42... Hardly. A rich grandma from America! We've no relatives in the West. We wait in line like everyone else. In that case you live in a region where skilled labour is highly rewarded. Or else... We flew in by plane, to make your guesswork even harder. In that case... Seriously, what do you actually do? Save. I'm so sorry. It's all right... It's just juice. I hope it doesn't damage your clothes. Was it red wine? Salt would be useful. You missed a bit on the pocket... - Is this your first time here? - Yeah, my first time. So watch the show and don't disturb us! How about a glass of cognac? Instead of the rotgut that idiot spilled in your lap. - I beg your pardon? - Two glasses of that concoction. It's called juice. Have a third one. Once again my apologies. Enjoying yourselves? Why not? After a long day of housework, why not have a dance with your spouse. We're entitled to it, aren't we? What's up? Madam, what's the matter? I saw it all as a little boy. I was punished for being bad. I thought you would start with love poems. They are the ones to be adored. Excuse me for interrupting. A message for you. - Can't wait to have you back home? - It's Lollobrigida, she misses me. There she is. One nil to you, ladies. - Cigarettes... - I'll fetch them. - Quite nice, isn't he? - You're crazy. Wanted to count my teeth, did you? Just choose - a rib or a tooth! Are you kidding? I would never do such a silly thing in my life. You've just spoilt the best fun. Why haven't you introduced me! It would be quite normal to invite me to the table. I don't feel like arguing about what is normal. So give me the money back. You're driving me mad. Give me the money back. I was just sitting there and you were fully absorbed. I was staring at you, but no reaction! - Please don't... - What's wrong? Your hair. Have a look at yourself. - You can't join us in that state. - Just a moment. Let me fix my hair. What's up? Can't you see what's going on? I'm okay now. Shall we go? Let's go. Who pairs with who? We have to agree on that. You started it. It's your money at stake, so you choose. I'm not the big boss here. I can't choose. I wasn't even at the table. If you had invited me, I'd be able to choose. You know too well. Of course. Look... Do it like this... Leave me alone! I'd like to... You get the other one, I get the blonde. I don't mind. All right, I get the... You arsehole! How stupid you are. Look what you've done! Look what's happened. You've screwed everything up. This wasn't supposed to happen... It's not my fault. - A large one for the trumpeter! - Give me money. I told you somebody would die. Don't intimidate me. Just give me the money. I can't enjoy myself, and now you won't give me the money back. Ms Betka, be so kind... Kravárik, sweetie, there he is, Kravárik. Look, I'll arrange everything. Don't make a fool of yourself, Cape Canaveral! Wait a minute! Wait! Come on, three, two, one! I invented this, as a matter of fact, along with a friend of mine who is now a university lecturer. You know, I am such a jack of all trades, and I'd like to give you a riddle. Are the stars above real or painted ones? Over there? Yes, please. Just a moment, I need to finish. My friend would like to... We don't know each other. - My name is Kravárik. - Miloš. Well, get out of here! Go fly a kite. Why not? No problem. - My cigarettes. - Are we in your way too? Forget him. I already forgot. May I introduce you to the renowned Lollobrigida? My name is Miloš. He's not as successful as Lollobrigida, but he is quite amusing. He is a fantastic lover... of jokes and... Well, I could tell a joke, but it would seem inappropriate here. - Do you only know dirty jokes? - It's not that they are dirty... Just I should be careful in public. Political, are they? That's right, such jokes can only be shared in private. How about finding a place... Let's say... How about having a dance together? Can you dance? May I ask you for a dance? Come. Don't get upset, she does everything the wrong way round. Who says I'm... What are you doing? Nothing... - Some kind of a trick? - This one hasn't turned out well, though. Let me try. Failed. You're not in construction...? It's a trick, isn't it? No. Try it yourself. We are not in construction. I type, make coffee... It's impossible. Typewriter, coffee... How does the Grand Hotel fit into the picture? - Seriously, what do you do? - I've already told you. I make coffee, type on a typewriter... Now it's you who has failed. I'm not in the construction business either. And we save. I've already told you this. - Save? - Why so inquisitive? - Are you a singer or something? - A "singer"? A spy. That's what we call inquisitive people. May I ask just one last question? Please do! - Do you dance? - Yes. - Is this seat taken? - I don't speak Slovak. All right, all right. Failure to communicate... - It's terribly hot in here, isn't it? - How about some fresh air? Or a glass of beer? I know one such place. There's even Pilsen beer available there. - Pilsen beer... - I love it enormously. Don't you believe me? We can check it out. Let's go! It was an accident. I'm sure. I know it very well. - You seem to know this place. - We installed the gas pipes here. Who keeps opening this window? We'll all catch a cold! Wait! Is it yours? - Cheers. - Cheers. I can't drink any more. Put it back in the fridge then. I'm terribly cold. Let's go somewhere else. Put my coat on. Have you lost your mind? - Hey you! - Me? What are you doing there? I'm looking for who's in charge of the Young Pioneer's troop. I am Baláž, foreman of the team. Miloš, without a team. What would you like to drink, Miloš? Just point your finger! Don't be shy, show me what you'd like. Milk, sherbet, mineral water... I like that best of all. We drank those at summer camp. Wait! Just a moment! Ms Betka! This one, madam! - That's Martell! - What? 30 korunas! You're right, too cheap for a Young Pioneer. - Anything more expensive? - Napoleon. Come here! Have you ever drunk Napoleon? And would you like to? Of course I'd like to. So come here. Pour him some Napoleon. Do you know how long it's been in the stockroom? Shall I pour one for you too? Just for the Pioneer. Wow, what a colour! To your good health! To your team! Shut up! So shall I drink or not? Drink! Cheers! - Thank you. - Don't thank me! You are going to drink this bottle on your own. But I don't have the... pesos... - How much is it? - 610. What? Yikes! One needs to try out a variety of things to have something to remember. Then it'll be easier for him to die. What? Who's going to die here? - What? - Who dies? No idea. - Would you like a receipt? - No, thank you. Thank you kindly. Wait! Not this way! The bottle's mine. You come, ask for a glass, Ms Betka fills the glass. So pour him a glass. Won't it cause trouble? May I really? Ms Betka, one more please... - Beware, it's cognac. - It doesn't matter. Caution! Is this all meant for me? Then I must... You aren't a local, are you? You know what? Get back to your flock! But may I then... come back at any time? I like you, I just can't stand your company for long. So may I come back later? Welcome, young friends. How was the courtyard? - Who's that guy? - Who knows? Were you out rolling in the snow? Yes? For Christ's sake, forgive me. Let's have a dance, What's going on? You left school a long time ago, didn't you? Of course, it was a long time ago. Still, I'm old enough, aren't I? One can tell. Why do you think so? Well, one can tell. But I didn't say anything awful. Did I say something awful? May I? How about us? What do you have in mind? You've forgotten about one thing. - Me? - The bottle. Our friends are drinking together, so should we! But he's forbidden us to take the bottle. - Is my dress wrinkled? - I can't see anything. - A little bit. - A lot? I told you a little bit. Will anybody notice? I wouldn't recommend them to. How badly wrinkled? Like that woman's over there? - Something like that. - So it's noticeable. Could be just due to sitting. Let's go back to the table. Why? You wanted to dance. You think the music's too sad. Maybe something more cheerful? - Leave it here, Ms Betka. - As you like. Ready? Come on! I don't want to dance, truly I don't! - What's wrong with you? - Nothing, I just don't feel like dancing. So what's going on with you? I requested this music just for you... I really don't feel like dancing. - Are you angry with me? - Not at all. I just don't feel like dancing. Okay then. - Come on! - I don't want to! There's still another piece I can do. Let me show you! Good, you are coming. You must help me. I need to distract that guy's attention from the bottle. So that I can... So what will you have? Cognac, vodka? What would we do there? I don't want anything. - For God's sake, what's eating you? - I don't feel like... He'll look over here, and I'll grab it. What are you after? I'd rather sit down. Your dress is not wrinkled at all! - I know. That's not the point. - So what are you getting at? All right, all right... What do you actually want? Nothing! Look, Olina is sitting on her own. And so what? We came together, so we should sit together, so she's not alone. - Embarrassing... - Embarrassing. She wants to have some fun as well. Dancing is fun too. Not for her, since she's alone. I see, Olinka wants to have some fun. You've already had fun, haven't you? I almost managed it! - Well, she wants some fun too. - It's for Olinka. Miloško has had one for me, hasn't he? The two of them have spoilt the entire operation. The ring is free. The first round! - Miloško, give me your hand! - Why? It's not my idea of fun. - No, I've got sweaty hands. - Then just wipe them? Wipe Miloško's hand. The gong has signalled the first round, Miloško's ready... Kvetinka is ready as well, Miloško in the heavyweight category, Kvetinka in the lightweight. Miloško puts forth... A small refreshment... Is that all you're able to do? Wait, you can't do this. I can still do some other tricks. Tricks with a razor blade, fantastic tricks with cigarettes. I can balance a glass on the tip of my finger... To entertain Olinka, I could imitate a hippo. Choose some nice performance for Olinka's benefit. Try to say something nice. "Something nice". Come on, say it. Of course I can, why not? Had we drunk more... Is Olinka having enough fun? This is beyond my comprehension. Old iron displayed on the wall, and at our construction site the stuff lies about in the mud. Don't you see, this is a piece of art. - Which one? - This one here. Is this supposed to be art? - People like it? - To the extent of stealing it! - They've already swiped two pieces. - Can something like that be stolen? I wouldn't even put it up in my toilet. Come please. Come on. So I was staring and... Here you are. Cheers. This is lovely. - Mr Bigshot. - Compensating for his insecurities. Don't you like it? It's great. To your feet, may they dance lightly and easily. What a big man! Showing off his money! At any rate, nobody forces them to drink it! Just a moment, wait there! I can't see that, what's up? Bottoms up! Just one more! So... Menagerie. - You're not partaking? - Not in this one! - Thank you. - You are welcome. He'll remember this for the rest of his life. Like some high roller! Has to borrow to buy cigarettes before pay day. Where does he get the money from? He saves and squirrels it away. Isn't it so, Mirka? He looks like an ordinary man. Shall we dance together? At your service! What did I do to them? I just talked to them, nothing else. They probably wanted to talk to each other in private. Why did they come to a bar then? - They have worries of their own. - Of what kind? - Today is their son's wedding day. - Why aren't they there? Because Holub Senior doesn't agree with the marriage. Why? It's a long story. You wouldn't believe me, anyway. By now, I'd believe anything. So why? Nothing surprises me any more. - Come on, why? - I'll tell you. After the war, Holub came home in a fabulous jeep, wearing a splendid uniform, with lots of bubble gum... He spent the war in Asia or Africa. In a place called Tobruk. He was promoted to Major, and then sacked from the army. And then they compensated him. - Do you know him? - No, this is the first time I've seen him. You might have heard about him. His son didn't study, he's got no trade, and today he's getting married. Ms Betka, that liquor... He who drinks, needs to pee, isn't it ever so? What about his son? He's marrying the daughter of his father's best friend. They were fellow soldiers in Tobruk. A salute to their honour! End of story. I still don't understand why? Nobody understands. Holub thinks there's too many rats from Tobruk in the family. Two grandpas, Holub Jr, and any grandchildren will be "brats of Tobruk"! See the point? I see. That's great! Look, he's roaring with laughter. None of your business. You're allergic to everyone and everything. Me? Everybody's picked on me for twenty years now... Please don't! I don't feel like staying here. Why are we here tonight? Please, don't start! It's ridiculous! Work for a whole year, just to have five days of fun. - But it's worth it. - I can imagine. - In the morning... - I don't need to get up, nor go to work... Nobody wakes me up, I can rest... Then comes breakfast... No rush, though. First, I call Olga on the phone to decide about breakfast. One time eggs, and the next time ham, sometimes both. Eggs are delicious. And then you go for a walk, don't you? Then lunch, and a walk again... Well, I say a walk... To the hairdresser. We dress up, then go for lunch together... If you have the money, why not? Nobody rushing us to work... "Hurry up, hurry up..." After lunch, a pastry. Am I right? - With whipped cream... - Twenty students eyes wide open, unable to get up the courage... Have you seen us? No, I was at work. Olga has your sweater on, and you're wearing her skirt. - You have a sister, don't you? - No, I'm an only child. Do you find us ridiculous? Not at all, everybody has their own idea of a nice life. And how about evenings? - After dinner. - In the evenings? We book a table by phone. Then we come for dinner, order wine, let the chef recommend something to eat. Yesterday we were sitting at that table. Over there? I wouldn't have spotted you there. You can't see it from the bar. Anyway, you weren't here yesterday. There was nobody here to walk you home, was there? Had Miloš known you were here, he would have... Gracious me! What do I get out of it? An eye-opener, isn't it? Nice. Shall we have it? We'll see. I like it enormously. I can do it myself. No, let me do it. Just a moment. Don't spill it. It would be such a pity. Bottoms up, Olinka. - Nice aroma. - Does aroma matter? Hurry up, drink it... No, savour it. It's just like Fernet Stock. Lovely colour. What colour? Mine didn't have any colour. Hurry up! Does it suit your taste? Yeah. Is there more of it! You'd buy a round for the whole place on my account? That I dislike immensely. That doesn't concern you, young lady, but this guy... what's his name? 'Pioneer'? That Young Pioneer didn't keep his promise. I hate that! Didn't I already ask for that bottle? Hey, Miloško, come and sit here! I'll make two coffees to sober you up. Do I deserve it? Come, have the coffee. Will you help him? Thank you. There you go! I'll wait for you, and then... Go! All alone. - Leave her alone. - Sit down! Shut up! Will you have a cognac? Ms Betka, cognac! - Becherovka! - A bottle of champagne! Turpentine! - What did you say? - Turpentine. Use it to flush your brain then! Very witty. Idiots! Any man, seeing a woman on her own, believes he can abuse her. An instant hero! I considered smacking his face. Are you also such a hero? Just a moment, ladies. Kvetinka will put it right. What are you doing? Let's pay and go home. Out of the question, they might have a fight. May I join you at the bar, Mr Friendly? Why not? Nobody else is sitting there. You're a stranger here, aren't you? Sort of unfamiliar with the situation... uninitiated into our affairs? I'd like to tell you, how much things here could be improved, I'd even dare to... use dark glass... or somewhere in the corner... In my seat again, Mr Kravárik? - It was empty. - Beat it! You're behaving like a hooligan. Is it taken? - What will you drink, my boy? - Not till we settle. I'm asking you, what you'd like to drink? I offer to buy you one, and you turn me down. Your friend could have said the same. Then it would be a reciprocal give-and-take situation, resulting in... How about the bottle? What shall we do with it? - You insulted that girl! - Me? I just offered her a cognac. It was the guys next to me. Take it up with them. Those two over there, see? So, will you take the bottle with you? And tell the girl not to be cross with me. Oh, you'll massacre them. Let the waiter bring the bottle! Okay then, taken care of. What's up? - We would normally say "pardon me"! - Pardon me. Louder! - Pardon me! - That's better! Finished. He sends his kind regards, and asks if you can forgive him. - Via a messenger. - He begs your pardon. He could have done it in person. Whatever next? As for the rest, we'll square outside later. One by one. I'll help you. Let's do it now. Mr Baláž is sending this, as agreed. So you won't be angry with him any longer. At least that's some consolation. Better than quarrelling, no? And ending up somewhere... like the police station. Excuse me, I had no idea... Splendid! I've never ever seen anything like that in my life before. One ended up under the table, another on the top of the other... Marvellous! Hands up, buffoon. You look a bit pale. - Water, soda... - Ladies. Thanks a lot. Tomorrow we go home. Wait a minute, comrades! Not that way! You accepted us, you should let us in. I certainly will, but in an orderly manner. Keep order. Order must be maintained here. No shoving. You're not in the village square. Just a peek, but no more! Quiet, please! You'll scare the guests away! Don't be silly, it's no use. Let me be. I won't be part of your theatrics. Forget the buffoon! What have I done to upset you? I don't care about your hang-ups. You'll be laughing over your breakfast, remembering how Miloš got drunk, how we met, how the buffoon entertained you... Stop it! What we did in the courtyard, drinking beer and the rest. Enough memories for the next two years. Foul mouth! Have you all had a good look? - Happy? - Definitely, yes. - All of us are coming Wednesday. - Will there be girls? Oh, yes. We're full. Not a seat left. I'm sorry, it's impossible. Not to mention this crowd of onlookers. Is Marián Labuda here? He always takes off! Seven, eight, nine... sixteen, seventeen... Where's Marián? Eighteen, nineteen, twenty... Fernet Stock, liquor? - Coffee. - Coffee? Three whiskeys, please. Why is your friend so sad? A headache? It'll pass. When she gets married. Are you married? I asked whether you were married. No? What's your job? What do you do? What's your profession? - Here you are. - Thank you. A student? A doctor? A shop assistant? It's not watered down. I'm a salesman. Do you know the play by Arthur Loman... Arthur Miller! About a salesman? Travelling by car. That's me. You? I sell textiles, liquors, pullovers, champagne, chocolate... all by car. I travel all around the world. Can you drive a car? Me? A car? But you can drive, can't you? Okay. My car is at your service. - 110.40 korunas. - Here you are. - 110? - That's right. A bit much, isn't it? This is an expensive place. Why are you so generous all of a sudden? Why are we paying 110 korunas? I've charged you the correct amount. Okay. What did we have? Eight juices. That can't cost 110 korunas. Your husband might be able to clarify. What have you got against my husband? Nothing personal, but... Shall I call your boss so you can explain what you have against my husband? Calm down, I'm paying the bill! Your husband had a gin in each glass of juice. Pal'ko, is that true? A gin in each juice at your request? - Yeah. - Why not let him enjoy himself? Don't stick up for him, he's not your brother! Don't you know? He's an alcoholic just out of rehab! I don't want to make a scene, but any woman in my place... Unlike you, I'm too decent despite your behaviour. I'll leave you. I've already told you three times! This time I'll pack and you'll never see me again! Don't write, don't call me... I never want to see you again! - Madam, don't do that! - You Tobruk lunatic! - Don't worry, mine is the same. - Leave me alone! But you'll have one more drink with me... Not me. Here you can, not me, I'm wise to it. Then I don't feel... That wild scene has scared your friend off. Your friend has disappeared. So what, Mr Kvetinka? Now let's get juiced. Starting with Napoleon. Agreed? We've had a good start. The only outstanding issue is báci Napoleon. What is 'báci'? The movement looks terrible! Dirty, nasty! But they're from Switzerland. I can see. What are you doing? Don't you know that each cup is served with two sugars? - I wasn't aware of it. - Were not aware... I remember that after that German girl you made a resolution... Now I am seriously interested. I saw you in the courtyard. You still owe for two beers. I'll settle next time, when we get paid... I can't understand what women see in you. Ladies! Come here! Would he be worth the sin? Don't be shy! Who knows. Unfathomable females. Two per cup! Can't you count? One... two! I am! One, two... How much do you want? - Five hundred. - What? - Five or six hundred. - Six? Here you are! One, two, three! - That's not enough, we've... - Do you want it or not? May I join you at the table? Good evening. My name is Kravárik. I'm not paying for anybody. That's not the point, I'll pay for myself. I am interested in your... view. I don't talk politics when I drink. Tell me, why can't people just get along with each other? Because they can't keep their traps shut. Not all of them talk rubbish. For years now I've been bothered by one... idea. People don't have ideas, and if they do, then... In Tobruk we... used to send those motherfuckers... and now what? Were you well rewarded at the time? If they don't pay you well, what then? I'm very well paid. I'm making this idea a reality. Before the war I was nobody, but in Tobruk I was somebody. Before that I was a labourer. Driving poles into the ground. Then came the war and the poles have since decayed. - I'll leave traces of my work behind... - Nothing. It means that something remains in this world after I die. Nothing will be left of an ex-major from Tobruk. Something will be left behind me. What will be left? - May I tell you? - Please do. Can you see those cities? They are not lit now, but once they are... Viewed from this angle, colours will stand out. Europe, itss surroundings, the rocket. I invented it all. Everybody likes it. How about you? Are you an electrician? I was formerly, now I do this kind of stuff. If you would be so kind... my mum at home... has a broken vacuum cleaner. Could you repair it? Vacuum? And how about Europe, the little towns... - Ms Betka! - Yes! You seem to have won the lottery. What would you like to have? What do you think I'll have? You have enough money, I have no idea. - Napoleon. - Okay. One? - The whole bottle. - The whole bottle? In that case you haven't won enough. But maybe we could - just add it to... - No way. My tab. Your tab is already full! Couldn't you just fix it? Couldn't you have something cheaper instead? No, because I need the bottle. But that's only half the amount. Now we have the whole amount. Let's opt for running a tab. A bottle of Napoleon for the gentleman. - Now it's a safe order. - Thank you, Mr Venturer. No need to thank me, I'm ordering for myself. I like to take, but not from you! I like that, "not from me". Nowadays everybody is eager to take, so you act the same! Let's agree on running a tab. 300 and 350... Napoleon! Drink, friend! Do me a favour, drink! Maestro, thank you. I'm not willing to be part of your circus! Everybody is on the take, so you take as well. I ask you kindly! Ms Betka, we've agreed. It's been paid for. In that case Ms Betka, let it flow! Pour it out! Pour it out! And you die of thirst! What a waste, Mr Baláž. An extra fifty korunas - and do empty it out. Have you ever seen anybody dump out Napoleon? Bravo, Mr Baláž! Mr Kvetinka, bravo! I'm ready. Do you like me? Come on! Have a look. Don't be so bullheaded. - What's up? - We have no Napoleon. We'll get Napoleon. - We won't! - As long as I am here... - Since I'm a screwball! - So you are, but... how much? So much. A trifle. Oli, give me 200 korunas. What for? I need them. 200 korunas. Are you serious? I won't give you 200. I need them. What for? I just need them! What for? None of your business. It's mine, so give it to me! It's my money, too. We haven't been saving all year so I can just give you 200. I want to enjoy it. Tomorrow I won't go anywhere. We're going home. Are you coming? I want 200 korunas. I don't want to go home. I won't give it to you, you've lost your senses... - Give it to me right now! - I won't! I saved all year, not going to the cinema, not wasting money. And how about me? Stuck at home all year, only to give you 200 korunas? Tomorrow I'm not going anywhere! And what do I do? You can go somewhere, I don't care. What for? We only have 200 per day. We have even more! You stashed more money away? No, but give me the 200! - I won't! - Give it to me! - I won't, - Olina, give me the money! No way I'm giving you 200! Give me the dough! Come home and stop being hysterical. I'm not hysterical! What do you want it for? It's my business! You want to drink it all away with that fool? He's not a fool, and it's not your... - Isn't he? - Give me it! He's been a pain all evening, and you'd give him 200 korunas, instead of him paying for you! He paid too! - Give me the 200 korunas! - I won't! I'll take it! I'll hurt you! - You'll do what? - I'll take it from you! I'll slap you about and drag you home crying! You nasty bitch... Flowers like on May 1. Okay. Three, please. All that's nice and good comes in threes. Is it okay? Thank you. - Here you are. - Thank you. Nice, aren't they? Just for you. Not there, this is the right spot. - This way, right? - Don't be angry. Are you ready to order? That's the fourth time I've asked. I don't remember us being on such familiar terms with each other. If each table took this long... You'll just have to wait! And light this cigarette! We want to have some fun! Here you are. And what are you drinking? A lot. What's this? Take it away! A cheap tablecloth. Is this supposed to be dinner? Take it away! An empty bottle... Excuse me, may I ask a question? - You're invited! - What's the time? You know what? Go and fetch three bottles of cold champagne. Move! - Three? - Three! Will that be enough? As you please! No way you'll drink them all. Well, they'll be here and that's the end of it! We'll buy a round - a splash of comrade Napoleon! Guys! Be so kind and wet your whistles! And a special treat for you. Allow me, my friend, to... because a trumpet is... my love. See? Trumpet is... Once upon a time, you might not believe it, I... the first trumpeter... You're a fellow trumpeter! Not to that extent, but once I... C note, gentlemen! Cheers! Cheers. At one time I used to... C note. Guys! May I play a C note? I was lead trumpeter at the firemen's ball! Don't worry, I'll master it. Don't worry, I'll get it. C note. And then what? For everyone... A bottle of cognac for everybody! Leave it at that! No, I must... that C note. Let's dance. - How about him? - The one with the trumpet? - It's all right. - Settled? Certainly, yes! Good takings today! Silence! Fellas... C note. Why so imperious? Enough is enough. Finito! Home... nice... home, get some sleep... Nice to meet you. Go home. Get some sleep. Come on... Who are you? No, wait please... Here you are, here's 100 korunas. It might prove handy for you tomorrow. Call the police, please. What for? You'll go home on your own. I'm not going anywhere! Call the police! I'm not going anywhere! C note! Careful you don't knock anyone over. - Let's go home, - Mother, is it you? Yes, I'm so glad to be here. Can you imagine? Put this on! Here it is! Put on your scarf! It's cold outside! Where have you put it? Thank you. Here you are, darling. What a place! - Thanks! - Welcome! - Many thanks. - Shall we go? Mother, I'll never freeze with you at my side. You bet. Come! The fighting at Tobruk is nothing compared to the coming battle. Goodbye. Goodnight. Have a pleasant evening. Do I have to drag you the whole way home? We've wetted our whistles, no need to spare the vocal cords! But I do the second verse. Can't you sing the second one? Cheers! "And when they kill you... when they kill you, they'll bury you." "They'll plant a green lily on your grave." So we don't only drink, but also learn! Did you get the second verse? So both verses from the beginning! Mr Baláž is sending this. - Take it away! - It's been paid for. Paid for? Cheers. Why are you staring at me? It's too difficult for you. I want a C note! What's up, don't you feel well? What are you doing there, mister? What are you doing there? Look, he's opening it up. If stupid heads were cut open like this, a lot would be revealed! Look for the fault in Vietnam! It's in Vietnam! If the wiring is okay, then everything is okay. If only it blinked a bit, but nothing at all. Goodness me! The painters are in! Hello, dear friends... I'm as fresh as a daisy! Olinka, you've somehow grown even more beautiful. It's not your concern! Why? Tell me, what's up? Look to the right! So what's going on here? Which one? - The one over there. - Okay. So what's the problem with you, my friend? My friend, lock me up. You've drank a bit and you want to go with us? - No, you must put me in jail. - But what have you done? What have I done? I've drunk away all of my team's wages... Well, anybody could say that. You have nowhere to sleep, right? I'll sleep at your place. We're not a hotel. Come on, go home. But you enforce the law! And I have drunk my team's wages! What made you do that? Stop messing about! Are we to be blamed because of that tip-happy guy? You're obstructing the law! Aren't you scared? This could cost you 50 korunas. Why did you do that? I wanted to know how it feels to have a lot of money. So tell me why? I wanted to show people a good time. Are you crazy or what? It's not the first time that money's been taken and splashed about. Let's go! Let's go, shall we? No more drinks! We're about to close, I'm sorry. Can't you see, we've closed the cash register? - Shall we walk them to the hotel? - Of course! I've got a bottle with me, we could sit down somewhere and... What? We're leaving, see ya. Bye... What shall we do now? - Give it to me. - What do you want? Girls! Here you go. Bye! Come! Let's go to bed! How sweet of you! Playing the high roller at my expense! When will you give me back the 50 korunas?
