Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway, we have a multiple vehicle... multiple injury accident. An absolute mess from Vine Street to the valley. If you're in it, expect a long commute. If you're not, seek alternate routes. If Dan doesn't want to do a daily rate, we can talk about a weekly rate. But I'm telling you right now, I'm not going below a million. I mean, think about it. I'm risking my reputation... as the host of this country's number-one... nationally syndicated talk show to do a cameo in some cheap slasher flick. I mean, why can't these guys write me a fucking decent part? You know? I lived through the fucking thing. By the way, did you talk to Cathy about that Navy SEAL script? Hang on a sec. - Hello? - Hello? - Who's this? - Who's this? - Who are you calling? - Oh. You know what? I'm sorry. I have the wrong number. That's okay. Wait a minute. I know your voice. You sound a lot like that guy on TV. Cotton Weary. - I do, huh? - Yeah. I think he's got a really sexy voice. - Well, thank you. - Wait a minute. You are Cotton, aren't you? Oh, my God. I am talking to Cotton Weary. I can't believe this. You got me. Look, I've got someone on the other line. Can you hold on one second? I'll be right back, I promise. Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. Andrea, I got to call you back. Someone's on the other line. So, you a big 100% Cotton fan? Yeah. One hundred and ten percent. That's very good. So, why don't you tell me who you are? Ooh. You're a naughty boy, Cotton. Now, what would your girlfriend say? What makes you think I have a girlfriend? I know you do. I'm right outside her bathroom door. Who is this? She's in the shower. She's got a nice little voice. Let's come in for a closer look. She's very pretty, Cotton. A step up from Maureen Prescott. Speaking of which, let's play a little game. Answer right, your girlfriend lives. Answer wrong, she dies. Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney? Who the fuck is this? Somebody who'd kill to know where Sidney Prescott is. One chance, Cotton. You've got connections. Where is she? You listen to me, you fucking psycho. You lay a finger on Christine... and I swear to God I'll kill you. Wrong answer. No. Wait. Hello? Shit. - Hey. - Get out of the way. - You just hit me. - Move. Christine, if you're there, pick up the phone. Christine, pick up the phone. Oh, shit. You have reached 911. Due to the volume of calls... Someone pick up the goddamn phone. Move out of the way. Shit. Shit. Cotton, is that you? Cotton? Honey? Okay, Cotton. You know I don't like your Stab games. - Who is it? Who's there? - Christine? Hon, you all right? I'm home. Jesus. You scared the shit out of me. You're not going to believe what just happened to me. What are you talking about? - Get the hell out of here. - Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe. I didn't mean to scare you that bad. It's me. Come on, open the door. - What are you doing? - What? What the fuck are you doing? I was... I was just, you know, trying to take the game to the next level. I'm sorry. Come on, open the door, Chris. The game? - Yeah, the game. - What are you talking about? I'm talking about how much fun it's going to be to rip your insides out. Now, open the fucking door, Christine. Oh, my God. Now you're fucking history, baby. Christine? Hon? The recent epidemic of road rage in Los Angeles. Innocent commuters mercilessly terrorised, even killed... Chris? - By these madmen of the freeway. - Don't mess around, okay? We're going to make them confront their victims face-to-face, mano a mano... right here on 100% Cotton. There is carnage on our streets. And remember, it could happen to you. Tomorrow on 100% Cotton. Road rage. L.A. drivers fight back. The news is next on channel six with our exclusive entertainment report live... from tonight's celebrity premiere in Hollywood... followed by... Oh, shit. Chris? Is that you, babe? Chris, if you're in there, open the door. Okay, honey? Chris? Come on, baby. Open the door. Chris. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jesus. It's me, Chris. What are you doing? Stay back. Stay back. - Chris, what's going on, babe? - You've gone crazy. That's what. Chris, was somebody in the house? No. Get back. Okay, okay, okay. Just calm down, okay? - Why do you want to kill me? - What are you talking about? Why do you wanna kill me? Gimme the club. All right, honey? Gimme the club. Gimme the club, please. Christine, get out of the way. Behind you. Shit. It was a simple game, Cotton. You should've told me where Sidney was. Now, you lose. Come on. Come on, Cherokee. Come on. Come on. Come on, Cherokee. California Women's Crisis Counselling. Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting to work. Can you patch me in? - Sure. Thanks, Laura. - Thank you. California Women's Crisis Counselling. How can I help you? Hi. Do I have to say my name? No, you don't have to say anything you don't want to say. How can I help? I'm 18 years old, and I have a boyfriend. - Sometimes he hits me. - It's okay. - You can talk to me, all right? - Thanks. So, in closing, as the future journalists of America... there is one thing that you need to remember. Being the best means being willing to do what the others would not. Break the rules. Stop at nothing. Be willing to have the world hate you, because that is the only way... that you'll get the story, the facts and the fame. Thank you. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yes? So you're saying that we should be ready to go out... and cut each other's throats because that's what you did. - Metaphorically, yes. - Well, tell me, Miss Weathers. - Was it worth it? - I'm so sorry. We're out of time. Gale Weathers, anchor woman for Total Entertainment. Thank you very much. There is a young man outside who wants to see you. - He says he's with the police. - The police? - Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D. - Hello. That's quite an impressive resume. Thank you. I assume you're not here for an autograph. I'm here because Cotton Weary's been murdered. - Someone killed Cotton? - And his girlfriend. Someone who left something he wanted us to see. I'll show you this because you're the Woodsboro authority and because you knew him. But I promise you, if you share this with the world, it's you I'll be arresting. I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which I plan to win one day, Detective. This was left on Cotton Weary's body. You have any idea who the girl might be? Oh, my God. This is Maureen Prescott. This is Sidney Prescott's mother. Hollywood is reeling today from news... of the murder of controversial talk show host Cotton Weary. Weary had only recently finished shooting a cameo as himself... in the film Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro... the third and final part of the famous horror series... based on the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders. Before his rise to television fame, Cotton had been imprisoned... and was later exonerated for the murder of Maureen Prescott, his former lover... Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was shooting here at Sunrise Studios... his first cameo in a feature film, Stab 3. Security here is tight, but we'll see if we can get a statement. Excuse me. Always a controversial man... Channel Eight news. We got to get in. We got to get in. No press beyond this point. Alone at night he crosses flames Ashe makes a fist with his red right hand Look, you're worried about the movie, then protect the movie, okay? Hire more security. Hire the National Guard. Just don't kill the movie. Violence in cinema is a big deal right now, Roman. This is not the kind of news this studio is after. So if we stop making scary movies, what? All the psychos in the world will retire? Come on. I've been making horror movies for 30 years, never had a psycho problem. He was your goddamn idea, guys. All right? An ex-con with a trashy talk show? He must've pissed people off every day. Detectives, there's no reason to presume that Cotton's death... had anything to do with this movie, is there? He was making a movie called Stab. He was stabbed. Probably some psycho fan pissed off they killed Randy in Stab 2. Well, Tyson, that'd make you next, wouldn't it? I am not a Randy substitute. I'm my own character. Named Ricky, who works at the video store. It's an homage. Hey. What if the killer's Sidney Prescott? I mean, what the hell ever happened to her? She's probably off in the woods... living like the fucking Unabomber, man. I'm starting to see why Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer didn't want to come back. Guys, this was about Cotton. We are not in any danger. "We are not in any danger," says Candy, page 15. I don't see you leaving. You think serious black actors my age can just throw away jobs? It's all a business now. They got Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway. L.L. Cool J's Shakespearing in the park. - Yeah. - Maybe it's not meant to be. Not meant to be? You win that talent search for the new Sidney. 50,000 girls and they pick you. You got to be praying this movie keeps going. Of course I am, but not at the expense of people's lives. Oh. Cue the violins, right? Jesus. Deja voodoo. We need this area cleared, please. Clear it. - Gale Weathers. Oh, my God. - Shit. I... Listen, I know we've never met... and I don't mind you never returning my calls, but I have to tell you... after two films, I feel like I am in your mind. Well, that would explain my constant headaches. You know, I'm sorry things didn't work out on 60 Minutes II. But Total Entertainment, that's a pretty good fallback. Thank you. I'm sorry that things didn't work out with Brad Pitt... but being single, that's a pretty good fallback. Gives me more time for my work. After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex character. Oh, and to be played by an actress with such depth and range. Jennifer, Nick said you wanted to... Gale. Dewey. Well, surprise, surprise. Someone dies and Gale comes running. Gale, I think you'll really appreciate my character work in this one. Someone's helped me understand the real you. Someone? Your ruthless ambition, your private self-loathing... and that lost and lonely little girl inside. Lost and lonely what? You heard me. Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it. Lost and lonely what? Little girl inside. I thought you were supposed to be in Woodsboro. Well, I'm surprised you thought about me at all. Listen, I got to get back to work. I really don't have time for this. - Wait a minute. You work here? - Yeah. The movie needed a technical advisor. Someone who went through the real experience, knew the real people. - Hey, Dewey. - Hey, Tom. Hey. It's the real Gale Weathers. Real from top to bottom. Tom Prinze. Watch your show all the time. You're so right. Pop culture is the politics of the 21st century. - Thank you. - And that story that you did... last month on me crashing my car? Wow, was that ever powerful journalism. Right... I especially liked the way you implied that it was caused by drinking and drugs. And that the tyre blowout was faked. That was great. Tom, sometimes in journalism you have to... Are you parked in the lot? Because I should check to make sure... that nobody's messed with your brake line. Who's he supposed to be? He's playing you? Him? What? I did not come here to fight with you, Dewey. - Cotton's killer left a picture. - Of Sid's mum. - The detectives told me. - Well, does Sidney know about it? Listen, Sidney doesn't need you and your camera in her life. Do you see a camera? Right. You bought me this purse, didn't you? - Yeah. - Look, it's a habit. I walk out of the house, I turn it on. What the hell is this? - It's like perfume. - Gale Weathers? - Could I be more popular? - No press. Mo press on set. Get that woman out of here. Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where is Detective Kincaid? I am working with Kincaid, Dewey. Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go. Rules are rules, Gale. But, really, it was great seeing you. Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up ahead is the old Seinfeld stage. Now, does anybody need a potty break? - Oh, I do. - Yeah, me too. Okay, let go. Thanks for your help, boys. Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that TV. News chick, Connie fucking-Chung. Hey, Connie, how's Maury? Dude, I think she likes me. See how she's looking at me? It's happening again. Cotton had a lot of enemies, Sid. The police aren't saying it's related to us. Do you ever think about her? Your mum? None of this would've ever happened if she hadn't... If she hadn't... Why'd she have so many secrets, Dad? Listen, maybe it's time you came home. I'm worried about you, kid. Out here by yourself. You never see anyone. The only people you talk to don't even know your real name. It's as if you don't exist. That's the idea. Psychos can't kill what they can't find. Sid, come here. Mother needs to talk to you. Everything you touch, Sid, dies. You're poison. You're just like me. You're just like me. Oh, my God. What have they done to me? They'll do it to you. - They'll do it to you, baby. - Mum? Roman? Stab 3. Jesus, I got to get a new agent. Roman? Someone here? Stan, my man. He does good work, huh? - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Fuck you very much. Tyson, go to hell. Well, excuse us, Sarah. Make-up tests. Yeah, make-up. You can use it. Damn it, have you seen Roman? Look, everyone in the office has gone home already. - He said it was important. - Everything's important to Roman. Oh, shit. - Director's office. - Sarah, it's Roman. I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away. Oh, it's no problem. I'm just looking at your music video awards. Since I got you on the phone, let's... Let's talk about your character, okay? What character? I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second. - I'm only in two scenes. - You're not happy with your part. I'm not happy that I am 35 playing a 21-year-old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked. And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid to have a gun in the house... after her boyfriend's been cut into fish sticks. Great, okay. So let's... let's run the lines. Fine. Page 28. Candy's big moment. Page 28. Ring-ring. Hello? - Hello? - Who's this? - Who's this? - This is Candy. Hang on. Let me get some clothes. See? I don't understand why I have to start the scene in the shower. The whole shower thing's been done. Vertigo. Hello? And I mean, my boyfriend just died. Why am I showering? Why don't we just read the scene? Candy. Nice name. Is that like Candy Cane or Candy Apple? Whatever. Come on. Who is this? I think you have the wrong number. - But you know my favourite name? - I'm hanging up right now. It's Sarah. Roman, that's not the line. It is in my script. Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How the fuck... are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? It's not just a new script. It's a new movie. - What? What movie? - My movie. And it's called Sarah Gets Skewered Like a Fucking Pig. Still in character, Sarah? Shit. Thank you for calling Sunrise Picture Studios. If you'd like today's commissary menu, press one. Mr Bridger? If you'd like to hear previews of upcoming Sunrise Pictures' releases... press four. If you'd like information about Sunrise Pictures' merchandise... - Come on. Come on. - Press five. If you're trying to reach Lot Security or you have an emergency, press six. Shit. Oh. Fuck. Look, I wanna get something straight. I only got into this because the police asked for my help. Why would the police come to you? Well, I did write. The definitive book on the Woodsboro murders. I'm sure you just can't wait to write another one. - What about you? - What about me? You said you'd never leave Woodsboro. "It's the only place that's real." But now you're here. Not with me. Dewey, I took care of you. I waited until you were well, but I couldn't stay there. It was like dog years. One year in Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else. So it's off to Paris for a week? New York for a month? L.A. forever? It was fucking 60 Minutes II. I couldn't say no. I could've been the next Diane Sawyer. Wait a minute. What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her. It didn't work, Dewey. We tried. We're different. You used to say that was our strength. Well... - Here you go. - Thank you. Dewey, you're not just here because of that second-rate K-Mart... straight-to-video version of me, are you? Brace yourself, Gale. All of this is actually not about you. All of what, Dewey? You do know something, don't you? - Off the record? - Always. Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman... who said she was with Stab 3. She wanted to see the file on Sid, "for research." - And? - The boys said no. And she wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into. - The file room gets ransacked. - And someone stole Sid's file? I already removed it. I think someone on the film is trying to find Sid. - I'm sorry, this is incredible. - I said, "off the record." Right. It's Jennifer. She needs me. - Jennifer? - Gotta run. Wait. Dewey, where are you going? I'm on duty. Stop following me. I happen to be working for the police, damn it. - You're not a detective, Gale. - Neither are you, Mr Incognito. - You left your motor running. - Damn it. Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want a picture, they want a conversation. I can handle fans. You see this, Dewey? I haven't had one of these in a year and a half. Someone's going to pay for this. Jennifer, settle down. What happened? - I'm with him. - You. Like I'm ever going to win an award playing you. - There's been a second murder. - Who? - Sarah Darling. - Where? At the studio. Where? Nancy Drew wants to know where. Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling. Don't you get it? Someone's killing them in the order they die in the movie. - Dewey, who gets killed third? - Who gets killed third? You do. I get killed in Stab 3? I get killed? - Yeah. - Dewey, where are you going? I have to get something from my trailer. Your... You live here with her? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. I needed a place to stay, and she said she liked having me around. - Why? - She says I make her feel safe. - She says I'm her rock. - Her rock? Yeah. If you weren't so concerned with pretensions and appearances... you'd be able to appreciate the positivity and emotional centredness... I provide a woman. Stone, I'm headed to the crime scene. You stay by Jennifer's side. I suggest a search of the grounds. Hey, Dewdrop. Can I have a word? Just so it can be straight. I'm the professional celebrity guard here. My resume lists Julia Roberts, Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice. You are the Hollywood hanger-oner. Because you're just no good as a cop any more. Your resume reads like the obituaries. So how about you take suggestions from me? All right? Whatever you say. Same deal? Found with the body? - Yeah, Maureen Prescott again. - This is great. Ten more murders and we can publish a calendar. The old "killer playing with the cops" routine. Very Hannibal Lecter. Very Seven. Doesn't the killer come after the cops in those movies? Usually one cop makes it. - And? - One cop doesn't. - Usually. - Detective Kincaid. - What do we know? Same killer? - Hey, hey. Terminal Entertainment, this is a crime scene, okay? Wallace, Miss Weathers is working with me now. - Thank you, Detective. - You're welcome. Well, in that case, I'm going to go dust for fingerprints with Jane Pauley. Photos, Wallace, please? Thank you. New pictures, same person. Anything turn up on your research yet? Nothing that will help with these. What about an increased police presence around Jennifer? She's the next one to get killed in the script. She has a bodyguard. And besides, the producers told us that there were three different versions of the script. Something about trying to keep the ending off the Internet. You should know that. You're the technical advisor, right? Three versions. Three different characters die next. And we don't know which one the killer read. Hey, hold up. All I ever wanted to do was make a real classic love story. And the studio said they'd let me. I just had to do a scary movie for them first. And now we're shut down, and I am fucked. God, it's not the end of the world, Roman. That is so easy for you to say. You can always go back to, to Must See TV. You know, I have no movie, I'm about to turn 30, and it looks like I'm now the next target. - What? - You? Why you? Do you think this wasn't a message? - Roman Bridger? - What? Mr Bridger, you didn't tell us... you spoke with Sarah Darling before she was murdered. Spoke with her, when? The guard said she was here for a meeting with you. What meeting? I don't... We talked with her room-mate too. Says you called Sarah, told her to come down to the studio. Room-mate answered the phone. Says it was you. Wait a minute. No, no. I never called her. I never told her to go anywhere. Room-mate says she knows your voice, Mr Bridger. Well, she wasn't speaking with me. God. Look, I did not call Sarah Darling. Sarah Darling said you did. Someone's trying to ruin my movie. Someone wants to kill my movie. All right, we'll talk about your movie down at the station. All right. This is the scene where you come with us. Dewey, Jennifer... Wait a minute. She wasn't talking with me on the phone. I'm coming. I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley, do you have a cell phone I can borrow? Yeah. - Thank you. - God. Roman. Remind me not to sleep with him again. Come here, Cherokee. California Women's Crisis Counselling. My name is Laura. How can I help you? Oh, Laura. I do have a crisis. Okay, well, whatever it is, you can tell me. Oh, my God. I've killed someone, Laura. - Are you sure? - Huh, I'm sure. I killed someone, I know it. Oh, my God. - Well, then... - I did. Then the people you need to call are the police. No, I need to call you. Just you. I'm sorry, your-your voice... Don't you wanna know how you can help, Laura? Are you listening to me? Huh? - Who is this? - It's Mother, Laura. Now, be a good girl and turn on the news. Do as Mother tells you. You're not my mother. How did you get this number? Who is this? You know your mother's voice when you hear it. Now, turn on the news. And with a second cast member murdered, Stab 3... has been officially shut down, prompting those involved... to hope and pray that these killings maybe over. Just one question. Do you think it's over, Sidney? Do you? The sky was dark this morning Not a bird in a tree Is this a wrap party or is this a wrap party? Scene 34. "Maureen's Murder Flashback." I never liked that scene. That's because you weren't in it. Scenes 40 through 47. - "The Prescott House Flashbacks." - Tom, stop it. You're scaring me. Two people are dead. Scaring you? Give the sweet, young ingenue act a rest. - You're drunk. - I'm coping. I bet she fought and clawed for that Sidney part. I bet she stepped on any poor girl that got in her way. So you asked her out and she said no? That has nothing to do with it. Right. Come on, Dewey. Scene 50. "Dewey Saves the Day." She's so focused on success that she never thinks... about who she's hurting to get it. And you saved her life, like, how many times? Gale wants the whole world to love her. One person's never enough. She's a dreamer. No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch. No, she's not. She's got a good heart. She does. She just hides it away because she thinks people see that as weak. This is a good picture of you. You look just like her. God, Dewey. You make it sound like you're still in love with her. And I left out the part that she's cruel... and selfish, obsessive and annoying. We have one Gale Weathers here. We don't need two. Hey, Dewdrop, got your girlfriend out here. Look who I found slinking around the yard. The nightly news. I wasn't slinking. I was walking. You were eaves dropping at the bedroom window. Yeah, a bedroom that you seemed awfully at home in. All right, let's talk. Come on. What's this about, Gale? Did you know they released Roman? Sarah's call didn't come from his cell phone. Where did it come from then? A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable. Well, thanks for the update, Gale. Why don't you just go back home? Dewey, wait a minute. Just wait one second. How old do you think Maureen Prescott is in this picture? Nineteen, twenty. That's what I thought, so I checked it out. I cannot find any information about her at this age. I mean, nothing. She lived in Woodsboro her whole life. Someone there must know something. Almost her whole life. Two years before... she met Sidney's father, she left Woodsboro. No one has any idea where she went or what she did. I mean, it's like she fell into a black hole, Dewey. She vanished. - So? - So? Why is the killer leaving pictures of-of Maureen? And why these pictures at-at... At that point in her life? I don't know. If I thought like a homicidal maniac... then I'd know how a homicidal maniac thinks. What? - Jennifer. - Jennifer? Look at the buildings. The second story. There and there. It's the same. It's the same street 28 years ago. Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was at the back lot at Sunrise Studios. - Oh, my God. - I got to make some calls. Steven Stone Protection Services. Stone, where are you? I'm just checking your tin can, Dewdrop. Well, come back inside and stay with Jennifer. Something's happened. I have to go to the police. Is that an order, Dewdrop? Because Steven Stone doesn't work for you. Get back in the house, Stone. Would I call you if it wasn't important? What are you doing in there anyway? Me? I'm just checking to make sure there's no killer in here... waiting to off you like he did your little sister. What did you say? I can't believe you said that. That makes me... angry. Fucker. Gotta call Kincaid. Dewey, where is everybody? - Oh, God. - Jennifer? Angelina? Tom? Oh, my God. What happened? Don't do that. I'm overreacting. Dewdrop? - Stone? - Oh, my God. Oh, God, Stone. Oh, God. - Dewey, is he dead? - Yeah. Everyone back inside. It's all right. Don't panic. Okay, outside. Everyone, stay together and try to remain calm. A phone. - It's not mine. - It's not mine. Shit. It's the fax. "Interior, Jennifer's house. Living room, night." It's a script page. What's it say? "With the bodyguard stabbed to death, the five stand trapped. - He's rewriting the movie. - As the killer waits outside... suddenly the fax machine sends news of their fates." It's a trick. Everybody, outside. Outside where he can pick us off one by one? Shut up. "The killer prepares to grant mercy to only one of them." Don't you get it? The killer says he's outside because he wants us here inside. - Which one is it? - Come on. "Who will survive? Is it Jennifer? Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale? The killer will give mercy to..." Everyone outside. He grants mercy to who? I wanna know what happens. - I wanna know what happens. - Wait for the fucking movie. I've got to know. I'm going back in. No. All right, everyone, back. Stay together. - What's it say? - "And the... killer will give mercy to... - whoever..." - Whoever? Whoever? Piece of shit. "Whoever... Whoever smells the..." I can't stop rolling down the hill. Gale. Jennifer. - Dewey. - Dewey. Dewey, where are you? Over here, Dewey. - Dewey. - Gale. Gale, behind you. Dewey. Are you all right? Yeah, never been better. Yeah, I'm all right. Where'd he go? - He must've rolled under the car. - All right, stay close. Is he back there? - No. - No? He's fast. Could've sworn I hit him. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Thanks for saving me. Ah, it's habit. Oh, God. What the fuck happened to you? - Jennifer, wait a minute. - Who gave you a place to stay? Who are you supposed to be protecting? Jennifer. Hey. My lawyer liked that. Not as much as I did. - Angelina? - Tom was in the house. How'd you end up way over there? Oh, my God. Tom was in the house. - Are we safe? - Safe from who? Wait a second. Another picture. Whoever it is is now taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder. But we know who killed Maureen Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it. Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken... you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong once before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother. And he was sent away for it. Maybe there is a third killer. Sidney might know something. I told you. I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it. That is for me to decide. I need to talk to her, Mr Riley. She is a key element in this case. I have a press conference in an hour. I need to explain... why there are three dead celebrities and a bodyguard. And a very angry mayor. Okay, look, we all know this has something to do with Stab 3. But what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving pictures... of Maureen Prescott taken over 25 years ago. And the photographs taken at the same studio Stab 3 is shooting out of. What does this have to do with Sid? Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter? Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you, and he was married to Maureen. What's your problem? Last night you were almost charcoal. You going to help us or what? Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph? Is that a threat, Detective? When it's a threat, you'll know it. - Was that a threat? - Boys, boys. Why don't we compare our gun calibres later? The issue is Maureen Prescott. Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott. And either Mr Riley is going to obstruct justice or he's going to put me in touch with her. So, where is she? Hi, you've reached the machine. You can leave a message. Talk as long as you want. Sid, it's me. This is the fifth time I've called. Please pick up. I wanna make sure you're... okay. - Sid. - Dewey. What are you doing down here? Actually, what was I doing up there? - Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm all right. - Is she all right? - Hey, you know Gale. It'd take a direct hit. So the news said this was the precinct. Who's this guy Kincaid? Come here. I told you to stay hidden. It's not safe for you to be here. The killer called me. - What? - Yeah, he found me. I'm no more safe there than I am here, and at least here I'm not alone. Okay, come on. - Detective Kincaid? - Yeah. There's someone here who wants to help. Oh, my God. Sidney. Is the man fast or what? - Hi. - Hi, Gale. - I'm glad you're all right. - Thank you. Sid, this is Detective Kincaid. Nice to finally meet you, Sidney. - The killer called her. - What? When? What did he say? Oh, you know, the usual small talk. What's new? How you been? How do you wanna die? Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number? He could have monitored her calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set? No. Do you have her number stored in your memory? - Phone memory. - Oh. Yeah, guess I do. Has anyone else ever used your phone? Just Jennifer. And you. Hey, I'm the cop here. You're in my office, Riley. The killer leaves a photograph after each murder, Sidney.
