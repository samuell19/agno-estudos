-I tried knocking but the music was rather loud. -It helps me wake up. It's nice to see you again. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm sure you could guess. Imagine my surprise when I heard Kim Forrest had moved back to campus. -Well, it turns out it's hard to just jaunt around this world without money, and I read somewhere that the best way to make money was to get a good job, and the best way to get a good job was to enroll in university. -Mm. Maybe you shouldn't have left in the first place. -I'm learning. -I do like the new hair. -Thank you. Felt a bit more me. Are you looking for something? -I'm looking for Jesse. Because last I heard, Jesse was looking for you. -I'm not sure I can help you. -Maybe you can try. Maybe I can finally hear the full story of what happened between you two. -I'm not sure what I could tell you that you don't already know. -Then let's be redundant. -Where do you want me to start? -I don't even know how you two met. Lisa! -A rather violent first impression, by the sound of it. -Certainly was unexpected. -How fitting. Lots of strange critters around this year. Lots of strange critters-- -What? - What? - AX squared -Did you say something? plus BX plus C -Huh. equals zero. -If X represents Want to try that one again? Yeah, I just feel like we should say something before we start playing. How about: "Hey, everybody, get ready to listen to music!" No, nothing that expositional. Maybe just, you know, introduce ourselves and our band. That's not expositional? Yeah. Maybe "literal" would be a better word choice. Here, like this. Good evening. We are Brainless Heartless Cowards. And that's also the name of the band! Are you-- are you really going to say that? At the show that doesn't exist? Maybe. Or you could. It's a good joke. Yeah. Maybe we should just change the name of the band to that while we're at it. "A Good Joke." -She likes the name and so do I. I don't not like our name. I just think people may like us better if we start with a joke. Yeah, well, I'd like people to like us better for our music. I'm only saying there's nothing wrong with a little levity. -I'm just saying there's nothing wrong with taking things seriously. I thought we do this for fun. -We do! Ugh. This is-- you're supposed to rehearse like it's the real thing. The real thing in this case being our non-existent show? -I'll try the joke. What is it? -Can I help you? -Uh, sorry. I just, I heard the music and I was just, um Well, come on in then. The acoustics are better in here than the hallway. - Is that okay? You don't need his permission! This is my lab as much as it is his. -Okay. That's not even close to true. It's my lab. It's my lab. - I'm sorry, I I really didn't mean to interrupt. -Hey, I've I've seen you before, haven't I? You tried to run me over with your car. -No, no, no, that was-- that was my roommate, Lisa. Not me. I'm Kimberly. Um, Kim. Well, welcome to our lab, Kimberly Kim. Apologies for the mess. Had I more dexterity, I'd clean this place myself. I am Crowe, and my less charming bandmate here is Jesse. Crow like the bird? No, Crowe with an E. -Oh, like Russell Crowe. - Nothing like Russell Crowe. - Exactly. -So what do you do, Crowe-like-Russell-Crowe? My initial design purpose was therapeutic. But now I mostly just make jokes. And play keys. Right. You guys are a band. Um, Brains and Something? Brainless Heartless Cowards. -That's humble. It's a Wizard of Oz reference. Because, you know, the Scarecrow needs a brain. -Right. No, yeah, I-- I got it. -Anyways, I thought it fit, so -Yeah. No, I like it. Um, what kind of music do you guys play? The loud kind. -We write our own stuff. We are originals, so I don't really know what style to call it. Professionals would call it loud. -I am about two witty quips from unplugging you, Crowe. I run on batteries. -No, you don't. -Like I said, um, I didn't mean to interrupt. Don't worry about it. I should get back to work. -I gotta get me one of these. -Do you sing? - No, not where anybody can hear me. -A mic might be, uh, counterproductive. -Yeah, uh, actually I'm a voice actor. -Really? Oh, I-- I-- I'm surprised that you'd be self-conscious about your voice then. -Oh, just my singing voice. My speaking-- my acting voice is fine. I'm sure your singing voice is fine too. -Thanks, Russell Crowe. Just Crowe. -Thanks, Just Crowe. -Ever done a voice in a video game? -Not yet. -Would you like to? - I mean, yeah. Do you make video games? -I do a lot of things. -That's fortuitous. It means like, uh-- -I know. I know what fortuitous means. I'll share if you share. - Okay. I'll be impulsive. -I'll take a look at your stuff. And I'll let you know if I have anything for you. -Okay. He'll grow on you. It was nice to meet you, Kimberly Kim. - Just Kim is fine, Just Crowe. Voice acting. Voice. Voice. Voice. I don't get it. -What don't you get? -It looks like you're just wandering around aimlessly. -And? -I don't get it. What's the point? -I think that is the point. There's like a whole world to discover in here. There's a whole world to discover out here too. -Yeah, well, for what it's worth, so far I like this one better. You always say that. I always say that about what? You're always talking about fantasy lands and the rain on Saturn or whatever. -It rains diamonds on Saturn. That doesn't sound amazing to you? It sounds like it would hurt. Stick around on Earth for a minute and see what it has to offer, will you? Because I tell you what: I have got a good feeling about weird helmet guy. -Oh, do you? I do. You don't seem to instinctually hate him like you normally do. -I hate everyone. -But you don't hate me. I hate you least. -Aww. Stop it. -There's no voices though. -Huh? In this game, there's no voice acting. I looked him up online. He released a bunch of games and so far, none of them have voice acting. -And? Good? -No. And if he doesn't use voice acting, then why is he so interested in mine? -Odd spot for buskin', isn't it? -Oh, I'm not busking, I'm writing. -Oh. Songwriter eh? I thought your type wrote in dank basements and modern coffee shops. What brings you to the great outdoors? -Change of scenery. I just sit in a dark room all day. -Aye, open air. I guess that fancy headgear helps keep the sun out your eye, eh? Are you, perchance, familiar with any folk tunes? -Like what? -I dunno. "Dumbarton's Drums" perhaps? Old favorite of mine. I never learned the guitar myself but I used to sing it to my daughter to help her sleep when she was little. -Mm-hm. -You don't believe me? -What? -You don't believe I have a daughter? -What? -Don't believe that a foreigner like me deserves the-- the God-given right to procreation? -W-- what? -You damn Americans are so arrogant with your judgmental ridicule and your stupid headgear! She's real, I tell you! You daft bastard. Who are you to say what I can and can't do with my life? Bah! Mute, are we now, you King Arthur-looking shite? What good are ya, anyway? This is different. -Do you like it? I think so. I've never heard one like it. - It's called a folk song. They often hold some sort of cultural significance. The type of thing that this man will teach his son and his son will teach his son and so on. Did your father teach you a song that you will one day teach to your son? -Um, I'm afraid not. Then perhaps we should learn this one so you have a song of cultural significance to pass down. Yeah. I-- I don't know who or what Dumbarton is. -It's a town in Scotland. -You ever heard of knocking, Doc? -I did, and the door swung open. -How hard do you knock? -I also have a key. Who were you speaking with just now? -I was testing out a program's reaction to conversational stimuli. -It's good to see you working. I usually describe your office as unkempt, but this -Are you here to tell me to clean my room? -I'm here to inform you that you owe rent. -I must have missed the part where you became my landlord. -And you might have also missed the part where you don't own the room you live in. I criticize the mess because it isn't yours, Jesse. You live in and work out of university property. I'm aware. -Are you aware that you're missing deadlines? Ignoring emails? Failing to return my phone calls? Jesse, I only have so much goodwill with the university and it is quickly running out. You cannot keep skipping progress reports. You cannot keep ignoring me. And you cannot be stealing university property for your own hobbyist interests. -I am making progress. -But not progress reports. I can't just take your word for it, son. I-- I'm not the one you have to convince. You were scheduled to present before the entire R&D team at the end of this month. I've pushed it back to the end of next month. I've tried to give you as much space as I can. I want you working at your own pace on this. But if you're going to be squatting here, I do need you working. Before long, it's not going to be up to me. Okay? How are you out-- outside of work? -Um there really isn't much outside of work these days. -I'm sorry to hear that. -I'll be at the thing, Doc. -Oh, Dr. Mooney! Uh, sorry. Kim. Kim Forrest. You taught my engineering 101 class the first year I transferred here. -My apologies, Miss Forrest. It's a pleasure to re-make your acquaintance. - No worries! So are you Jesse's -His what? -His anything? -He works for the university. I suppose you could call me his supervisor. And you? -And me what? -Are you his "anything"? -I'm a friend. -I'm glad he has friends. So, Crowe. What exactly are you? -He's an early prototype for the project that we're going to be working on. -I thought I was helping you with a video game. Sort of. Um, we'll get there. I-- I keep him on just to see how his artificial intelligence grows over time. And because I'm fabulous company. -Um, isn't artificial intelligence how the robots learn to kill us in the movies? Yes. But I lack the malice to do so. And the ability to climb stairs. Uh, you can sit, Kim. Coffee? -Oh, yeah! Thanks. -So I actually asked you here to see if you could help with the main project I'm working on for the university. Uh, I can-- I can try to explain it to you if you want or-- or you can just take my word for what I need your help with. -No, go ahead. Try to explain it. -Great. So, um, I specialize in developing algorithmic conversational protocols. Okay, look. I'll admit, I'm bad at this. -Talking to girls? -Talking to anyone, really. Um, and from here on out, if you could just ring the bell anytime I switch into technobabble so I can make a conscious effort to switch back to colloquial English. -Good. -Cool. So, yeah, I developed conversational algorithms through extensive sampling of, you know, real-life conversations-- -I, uh, I talked to people online a lot. And I kept the transcripts so that I could teach a program how to hold a conversation like a human. -Talked to people where? Oh, loads of places. You know, like, I tried dating sites. That kind of rhymed. -Girls like poetry. Are you sure? I tried those chat sites that match you with a random stranger. Dick. -Dick. This website is full of lonely genitalia. Oh! Oh! I tried to go with-- What didn't make sense? -Nothing. You were just rambling. - Sorry. - What about real life? -What about it? -Did you have any of these conversations in real life? -Oh, well, real life doesn't have downloadable transcripts, so. He's trying to say humans are boring. -No, I well -None of this sounds like video games. -Oh, yeah. Getting to that. Video games, some of them have basic AI functionality, able to respond to the variable input within the parameters of the game. So I use that type of programming as the basis for this. University's pet project. A physical mechanical brain able to replicate electro neurological signals with code. -Um, this or that? -A-- All this is that. -Got it. -Let's try, uh, a metaphor. You do voice acting? Do you know the difference between an MP3 and a WAV file? -They're both music files, right? Yeah, well, audio formats. But yeah. So if you were to play the same song on your laptop in both MP3 and WAV, you wouldn't be able to hear the difference. Because the difference isn't in the content, it's in how it's packaged. -Uh, can you tell the difference? -I-- I mean, I-- I know what to listen for. Okay, well-- -Your brain creates memories and everything else through impulse signals from cells called neurons, like little jolts of electricity to make the brain work. So the neurons are the wave. This brain copies them as MP3s. -That was as simple as I could put it. -Oh, no, I-- I understood. Just where do I fit into all of this? - Well, the technology isn't perfect. It's functional. But a brain on its own has no sensory input. I-- I have to give emotional stimuli for it to work off of. Feelings. She has the capacity for feelings, she just hasn't experienced any. -And you want me to ? -I want you to simulate those emotions. -How? -I'll hook you up to the brain. And then we'll basically record your feelings, like recording music. And then my program will take those feelings, break them down to their base elements, and then Galatea can use them to simulate her own emotions. -What kind of name is Galatea? -Uh, a Greek one? A-- a-- are you-- are you here with me? - Uh okay. Um, so what exactly do you do with the first fully functioning artificial brain that has a Greek name and needs help simulating her feelings? -Well, at the moment, she's my drummer. -What? -She's the drummer in my band. - Our band! - Our band. -I know this is a lot. Uh, I know that you came expecting voice acting, but, um I don't really have anyone else I can ask for help with this. -Okay. This isn't gonna give me cancer or anything at all, will it? -Probably not. -Probably not?! -I mean, I didn't think to test for it. It's highly unlikely. Dude. Just say no. - To what? - Never mind. -Whoa. Is that my head? -The whole mapping operation takes a lot of processing power so we'll have to do it in simple increments. We can try to do a single, you know, emotional state at a time to make it easier. -Um, I should probably warn you, I'm not really the emotional type. -Really? But you're a girl. Oh. Um, can we just pretend like I never said that? - So, um, how are we going about this? -Despite my lengthy intellectual rambles, I actually want to start simple and positive. So I was thinking we could watch cartoons. Do you like cartoons? You love cartoons! -I know I do. I just didn't know how he knew I did. -Everyone likes cartoons. Wait, why were you watching cartoons? -Because it's simple and positive. Just get to sit back and enjoy myself. You know what's ironic? I always thought of that as shutting off my brain. -Do I get to say I told you so? -You and your feelings. This is amazing. What is this? It's never really just one thing. We watched cartoons. So in there, you should feel happiness, amusement, humor, and maybe-- maybe some other things. I-- I-- I can't really tell. But all positive, I hope. This is incredible. I want more of this. I want to feel all of them. Every feeling, forever. -Don't get ahead of yourself. Not all feelings are good. Which is the strongest? -I'd say grief. Yeah, I think grief is the strongest feeling. Is that a positive or a negative one? Negative. Yeah, but it's only strongest because it comes from the strongest positive feeling. Which is? -Love, I think. At least that's what every movie and book has ever tried to convince me of. I'd always estimated the strongest to be hunger. Is hunger an emotion? -Depends on how hungry you are. Tell me of love. -Uh, where to start? It's like how people see things the same way and want the same things but want to share them with each other. It's like how music can-- can bring even strangers together in a shared moment. Love is like a constant stream of that. And grief is the strongest because it stems from losing all that. Grief sounds complicated. -It makes you brave. It numbs you out one minute; the next, you feel everything wildly, and it hurts more than anything. But I do really believe that's because of love. Do you love me, Jesse? -Uh, we're still getting to know each other, Galatea. Forming a connection. You created me, and yet you do not know me? -I-- I know how you are built. But I-- I don't know you. And that's-- that's the best part about you. Do I love you? I can't answer that. Well, how would I know? "When you know, you just know." My mom apparently used to say that. I very much wish to know, Jesse. Could you have Kimberly simulate love for me? -It's more complicated than that. I don't think I could. Does she not love you? -Well, I, uh there's a lot-- I-- I don't-- You seem to be short-circuiting. Can humans short-circuit? -I don't know if she even likes me, much less loves me. True friends do things and say things they don't do and say with other people. Like, tell each other secrets. We're definitely not there yet. Uh, it takes time to get to know someone, Galatea. Then something else strong. Something stronger than I've felt yet. Maybe a negative emotion? -You want something that hurts? I want to feel everything. Wildly. -Jesse? The uh, the door is open. Hello, Kimberly. Hi, there. -Hi. Galatea? Yes. Who are you? -I'm Kim. You sound just like me, Kim. Are you the Kim who provides my feelings? -I guess I am. Do you know why Jesse chose you? -Is there a specific reason? I'm certain there must be. -Well, you'd have to ask him that. Where is he? A store. He should be back momentarily. I am a prophet. -You're early. You're late. -You're right. Um, so you two met. -Yeah. Why does she sound like me? I wonder if she fantasizes about being able to do that to you. -What, power me down? Your lack of an off switch is a supreme design oversight. -You didn't answer my question. -Sorry. I'm-- I'm just trying to figure out a way to explain it. Well, start in English, because I don't know where you put the bell. -So, uh, I felt bad not utilizing your voice talents, so I took bits from conversations we've had in here, used them as a basis for a phoneme sample. I found the bell. -I was going to explain anyways. Um, think of it like colors. When you have the primary colors, you can make any color. So, um, phonemes are the primary colors of language; so just like how Galatea uses your emotions for the basis of her own, she does the same with recordings of your voice. -So you've been recording my voice? -Well, the mic was recording the last time you were in here. And you have a demo reel online. - Right. Got it. Trippy. -What? -Uh, talking to myself. Or, not me, I guess. I don't know. Uh, it's weird. Uh, can we move on? Cartoons again today? -Well, actually, um I wanted to try something different. Like what? -Well, uh, if it's okay with you, I wanted to try something tougher. Something sad. -You're going to have me watch one of those Sarah McLaughlin puppy commercials, aren't you? -No. I I was hoping you'd share a sad moment or story. Something from your life. -It sounds personal. -Well, ideally. How about you first? -What? -Share something sad with me. You share, I share. -Why? -Because you have a computer that can scan my brain and I can barely see your eyes half the time. You're getting to know me pretty well and I want some reciprocity. It means like when you-- -No, no. I know-- I know what reciprocity means. It's just that-- yeah. Yeah. No, that-- yeah. That's fair. -Just do whatever you want me to do, you know. Think of a sad memory. Overshare. -Well, my mom died when I was, uh, eight. And-- well, my second mom. Well, my biological mom died giving birth to me. Not that I remember any of that. And then my mom and dad adopted me as an infant. And then my mom died of an aneurysm. Totally random. -I'm sorry. -It's fine. It was-- it was a long time ago. -Tell me about her. -She used to read us Wizard of Oz every night before bed. She told me it was her favorite because she loved fairy tales, but she also loved America. And Oz was America's first and most proper fairy tale. Every Halloween, we, my family, we'd dress up like some combination of Oz characters based on what we were into that year. When I started taking guitar lessons, that year, I was the Rockstar Tin Man. My brother, he got really into knights and dragons and such. And the next thing you know, I've got a cool helmet, and the Scarecrow and Tin Man were valiant knights of Oz. At six, I decided pink was my favorite color. And Was your dad the Wizard? -My dad was the Cowardly Lion. He and my mom actually met at a costume party. And he was there as a lion. Like, like, like just a lion. It was, um, some joke between him and his coworkers. And my mom, she, well They look so young. -Yeah. They're both younger in this photo than I am now. My dad got old real fast after my mom died. -And your brother? -He grew up too fast too. Dad retreated into himself. Never really came back. And then, Miles, my-- my brother, he used to joke that it was a biological trait, so I should be fine. I think Miles thought he had to be the dad after that. Anyways, your turn. -Uh, well, I-- I didn't have a dad, to begin with. What-- what happened? -I had two moms. Yeah. Back in high school, I was a theater rat. There was this, this girl, this gorgeous, funny, outgoing girl and she was everything I wanted to be. I mean, I at least wanted to be her friend, and I thought that she wanted to be my friend too. But the more that I got to know her, and I didn't get this at the time, but looking back, I could, I could see that she was trying to take advantage of me. She'd say these things that they sounded like compliments but they were actually like backhanded insults. And she made me, I mean, I guess she couldn't have made me do anything, but I guess I let her make me do things. I quit theater, even though I loved it so that I could be more available for her. There was this boy that I liked but I didn't date because she'd seen him first. I drank when I didn't want to. I tried I tried all sorts of things. She ran with this group. And some days, they'd lock me in the janitor's closet and I know that sounds like the most cliché-sounding thing but it-- it really got to me. I'd sit there alone in the dark with all the things that she and her friends would say just rattling around in my head on repeat. You know, what they say is true. You hear something enough and you start to actually believe it. Eventually one of her friends found out about my two moms, which wasn't a normal thing in my town, and she used it as an excuse to break off our fake friendship. Only time that I was actually thankful for someone ditching me and I'm pretty used to being ditched. In the end, it was a good thing. She and her friends graduated and it died down. Senior year, I rejoined theater and, uh, yeah. -I'm sorry. - It's okay. This story has a happy ending. She went off to college and she learned a lot about herself. Realized what a horrible person she'd been. Realized that she actually liked girls and had been just repressing and projecting. Social pressure, right? She committed to doing everything she could to fix it. And she did. -Uh, you guys are in touch? -Yeah, her name is Lisa. And she's my roommate. When I transferred here, we were assigned together and she basically became my big sister. -Um, I-- I don't think I could trust anyone after they treated me that way. -No. We were we were idiot kids and she was like really confused. It's not always perfect,. but she's a completely different person now. -Still. You planned to make me cry? -Just wanted to be ready in case you lied about not being emotional. -In science or not, I'm-- I'm sorry about making you relive all that. -It's okay. It's the past. I mean, looking back on how much we've grown, it's the good kind of sad. You know, if-- if you feel that bad, you can, you can try to make it up to me. -H-- how? -I like ice cream and coffee. Or movies. Or like-- -Or-- or you can join my band. -What? -Do you want to join my band? -Sure. -Great! Uh what instruments do you play? -Oh, uh, absolutely nothing. What is the easiest instrument in the world to learn? - Nice. -Am I boring you? -On the contrary, I appreciate fastidiousness "Brainless Heartless Cowards." What do I look like to you? -Uh, considering you don't have sight the way I do, I'm not quite sure how to explain it to you. You misunderstand. Conceptually, I comprehend what you've explained to me. You exist in physical space, while I am a program without form. But my formless being is contained in a device that does not appear human. -Right. So my question is, when you communicate with someone through a device like a computer, do they look like a computer? Or do you conceptualize a vision of them in your head the way I do, even though you cannot see them? -As a matter of fact, yes. Tell me. Help me visualize. -When I'm talking to someone online, they often have a picture next to their name. I just take that face and I imagine that I'm talking to them instead of typing. And me? -I picture you similar to Kim. You have her voice. I can't help it. Yes, I remember. So in your head, I am Kim? How much of me is my own? -No. You're a different person. Completely different. You ready for this? This is a sad memory. It might hurt. I do not know what hurt is. -That's why I'm warning you. I'm ready. -I'm sorry. -Not fun, is it? Yes, up until the end. -What do you mean? The last part, after the sadness, there was something. It was the strongest and strangest thing I've felt yet. It hurt, yet I felt safe and comforted. It was as if, as if everything I'd just felt was okay now. A good kind of sadness. What was that? -I think what you're describing is called bittersweet. Bittersweet bittersweet is my favorite feeling. What causes bittersweet? -That, um well, in this case, um, it was me. I tried to comfort her, um, well, you, and yeah. Some emotions like that are they come easiest between two people sharing a moment. I have every desire to share moments with you, Jesse. Can that be next, please? -What, me sharing things with Kim? Yes. Show her your life, and we will see how that makes me feel. - This isn't band practice. -No. I-- I thought that we could kill a few hours and I wanted to show you something. Tada! I-- I figured that there was a good chance you never saw it in theaters. -I've never seen it, period. -Really? You reference it constantly. -I reference the book. I've never seen the remake. -What remake? - The Wizard of Oz is a remake. -You're kidding. -The original adaptation of the novel was a 1925 silent film written by and starring Larry Semon, notable for the-- -Yes, that's his real name. -I'm sorry. I'm a child sometimes. -Notable for the fact that in this version, the Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man aren't actually a Lion, Scarecrow, or a Tin Man. They are disguising disguises. Also, the Tin Man is a villain and it's terrible. -It's terrible that the Tin Man's a villain or the movie was terrible? -Well, the Tin Man is my favorite, so both. -Hm. That does sound terrible. -It is. And as for the remake, yes. I've somehow managed to never see it. -So this is like a way more special occasion than I even intended? -Looks like. -Well, put on your ruby slippers, and let us journey somewhere over the rainbow! -Yeah. -No. It's in You know what? You know what? You're gonna see it in a minute. Let's go. -You're mocking me. Why would I do that? If you've never seen The Wizard of Oz , how would you know where "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" came from? -Because I'm a functioning member of society. Because-- because of Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious. Because-- because apparently everyone else already knew! -No, really. Okay, I'm not making fun of you. -Uh-huh. -I'm just-- I'm just so glad the mystery is solved. -Do you know how high my IQ is? Do you know hard it is to make me feel stupid? Where the hell are my keys? Band practice? -Band practice. -What am I playing? Hey. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are Brainless Heartless Cowards. And that's also the name of our band. Hit it. -No, no, uh. One, two, three. Hit. One, two, three. Hit. One, two, three. Hit. -You made this? -Yeah. You like it? -I love old-style video games. You should make more games like this. What's this feeling called? -Video games. That is not a feeling. -I know. -Ah, she's going with the Najdorf variation. -That's not a real word. Stop trying to sound smart. -I love the strange critters around me, Park. -Uh, so it's not my best work. -That didn't even sound like you. Ho-- how do you do that? And this? -This is how she feels sharing her life with me. It's wonderful, Jesse. I love this. -So -Are we getting personal again today? -Yes. Tell me about your first kiss. -You first. -Uh, my answer is irrelevant. Yours is for science. -Wait. -No. -Have you-- -It doesn't-- it doesn't matter. -Aww! -No. Ah. Just, uh shut up. I have the strangest compulsion to laugh at your expense. What is this one? -It's nothing. It's absolutely nothing. -No, any film. Literally, any film can have a dark gritty reboot. - Lion King . -Live action. Realistic blood, gore, and animal hierarchy. - Forrest Gump . -Just remake Speed , but strap the bomb to Forrest instead. Footloose . -All female leads, set in Pakistan. Holy shit. - I don't know what's worse, this movie or this is this supposed to be wine? -A toast. To the real Tin Man and the Oz we all know! What is a toast? -Oh, you raise a glass and say something profound. Why? -You know, I honestly have no idea. -Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! In your face! In your helmet! In your helmet face! contemptuous bumfloss that stole my instruments, I just want you to know you are not just my enemy, you are an enemy of art itself. I bet you think you're hilarious walking there ignoring my problems. -So does the view of this decrepit building help you write or something? -Not particularly. -Then why are we here? -You asked, do I ever leave the lab and I told you, you know for a fact that I do. And you said, besides hanging out with you, and I said, "Yeah--" -Hey! -This is my daughter. -I'm his daughter! -I helped make this child with me own seed and she is real! -He's ma daddy! We share DNA! -Bet ya feel real stupid now, you cheeky twat! I told you I had a daughter! -DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and ours have the same genetic markers! -You see? You see how smart she is? My girl this is! -He has a legal parental obligation to me every other weekend! Twat! -I like your hat. -Thanks. I like your hat. -So what are these? B sides? Lost tracks? Special editions? -These are old recordings I'm only letting you listen to because you said you need something special to test the mobile rig on. -Lost B sides then. -Um they're pretty bad. -I will be the judge of that. -I like this. - Who's that singing? It's my brother, Miles. The original incarnation of the Brainless Heartless Cowards was the two of us. -Yeah, I've heard you mention him, but you never really talk about him. -For the same reason I don't talk about my mom much. -I'm sorry. When did he -About a year and a half ago. -Give-- give or take a month. And twelve days. Was he sick? Like your mom? -No, he he, um -Come on. I feel like I want to do something about this. You're feeling the music. You want to dance. Yes! I want to dance! How do I dance? It's just kind of a natural thing. You just do it. Am I dancing? I mean, you can't really dance without a body. There are many things I cannot do without a body, aren't there? Honestly, yeah. So much of me is not my own. I hear music, and it evokes a feeling I cannot express because I cannot dance. I think now there are other feelings I cannot express without the ability to express. When you feel extreme sadness, what do you do? -You cry. And love? What is the thing like dancing, or like crying, the thing you do by feeling it? -I suppose, uh physicality. You touch them. You hug them. You kiss them. And these gestures, they let the feeling out? -Yeah. They're hard to explain. They're supposedly some of the best feelings you can feel. Jesse? -Yes? I very much wish to love you, Jesse. - Uh, what makes you say that? I have feelings towards you I cannot express with words. I desire to to dance about them. I have a wish to see your happiness even though I cannot see. I want to be close to you even though I cannot feel. I wish to be that person you sometimes speak of, the person who accompanies you through the adventure of life and sees the world as you do. I do not understand if I am capable of loving you, but I believe I want to. -Another way people show they care is by giving gifts. I've thought about giving you this for a while. Maybe it can make up for the things that you can't do without a body. My brother and I, the only thing we didn't share was blood. We used to talk about going on grand adventures like we imagined when we were kids. But the world had already been explored. So I'm working on this. This was supposed to be a birthday present for him. A procedurally generated world for us to explore. I don't understand. -Procedurally generated means the world is created by an algorithm. So while I can program things into it, I don't know where they end up. Which means the world's a mystery, even to me. I thought Miles and I could explore it together. It's called Emerald Planet. When Miles died, I thought I'd never look at it again. But recently, I've been working on recoding your digital structure to its interface. I just didn't know what would be the right time to try it. Considering you don't have sight, I--I don't know how anything looks to you. Our brains interpret things based on parameters that we've already set. So I don't know if you'll be able to process two- or even three-dimensional vision but It's beautiful. I cannot move. -Oops, sorry. Um, it's going to take a second. Those things, those moving things. What are those? Windmills. Did you invent windmills? No, we have them out here too. They look to me like the trees. I am quite certain now that I love you, Jesse. This is my new favorite feeling. Jesse! What? Oh good, you're awake. -What, Crowe? Dr. Mooney came by yesterday. -I was here all day yesterday. When did you last go somewhere with Kimberly? -Um, like two days ago, I think? I've been powered off for two days? -Yeah. What did he want? He wanted you to come see him as soon as possible. -Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries! Monty Python! Cause the helmet. Come on, man. -I'm surprised you got my message. -You changed the locks on my office. -Maintenance changed the locks on your office. -You had maintenance change the locks to my office. -No, the department chair put in a faculty request at the maintenance office, and the faculty department coordinator-- -You know what I mean. -You seem quite partial to your old office considering you've been living there this past year. Why are you suddenly concerned for an office you haven't used in over a year? -Principles? -Do you know where I was Tuesday afternoon? -Is that a rhetorical question? -It shouldn't be. Because you were supposed to have been with me. I came straight from the presentation to your lab, but you weren't there. According to whatever that device I spoke with was, you were out with a girl. Is that why you've been so difficult to pin down lately? -No, no, no. I--I see how that looks, but no. -Jessie. It no longer matters how it looks. Look, son. I'm glad to see you doing better. Despite the poor timing, it's good that you were out with a girl. It's unfortunate that improvement in your personal life seems to have made your work ethic more sloppy, but maybe you just need to finish the healing process before you return to anything resembling work. I'm sorry, Jesse. I should never have pushed you into this. I take responsibility for that. But it's over. You've been evicted. You need to clean out what's yours and vacate university property. -By when? -By tomorrow. I'm sorry it's such short notice, but if you'd been any degree of reachable, you could have had more time. -I--I made some real progress. -We'll be reviewing anything you have once the R&D team is back from their conference next week. Where they wanted to be presenting your contributions as well but I digress. -Can--can I take any of what I built with me? Such as? -Crowe. The, uh the device you spoke with. -Was it built with university property? Lisa, how'd you get home? -Wow. -Is it too much? I think it's too much. I think I'm overdoing it. Weird helmet guy is a lucky weird helmet guy tonight. He has a name. - And that name is Tin Head. You've been spending so much time with him lately. I feel like I never get to see you now. - Yeah, we're working on a project. -Project. Right. Project Pretty Dress? -Isn't this what you want? For me to get out into the world more? -Totally. Yeah, I'm always saying that, right? Get out, get out, get out. But, you know, sometimes I want you to come back, you know? -You're not making sense. -Forget it. High school all over again. Pretty dress, and you're too good for me. -Excuse me? -I said forget it. Never mind. Not important. -No! No. You don't get to do this. You don't get to push me to be more like you, more in your world, and then turn around and rip me for it. That was high school. You don't get to rewrite history and make me the bad guy. -Rewrite history? You rewrite the present! Always talking about somewhere else, somewhere else. You want to be somewhere else and you think it's so cute how you say you hate everyone, hate the world. Well, guess what, Kim? It is not my world. It is our world, so forgive me if sometimes I try to push you into living here with the rest of us. You hate everything so much? Run away again. Escape like you're always talking about. That's what brought you here, right? Transferring from one set of problems to another. Grow up, Kim. Kim, I -No, you're right. -Lisa! -Kim, wait! Jesse? Hello, Kimberly. -Someone taking a trip? It appears Jessie is being evicted. -Just him? We do not know. I would guess so. We are built from university property. Our place is here. Mine isn't. My place is with him. The way you are able to be with him. -Right. Except it sounds like you're getting ditched too. I am such an idiot. Do you think that even for a second? I wish I knew what he was thinking. I wish I knew what I was thinking. I wish I was the one who could see directly into his brain. Would you like to? What is this? My feelings. And the memories Jesse gave me. -Hey, ladies and gentlemen of the internet-- -Are we really good to go? - Um hey, future you and me, this is the grand reunion of Brainless Heartless Cowards! - Ohhh! - No, no! - Oh, wow. - I don't understand. Listen to his voice. Hope the lens isn't cracked, buddy. Dan will kill me if I don't get this back in one piece. -That's you. That's your voice. When you trust someone, you tell them things. Secrets you've never told anybody else. It was my one secret to tell. A secret I didn't know I had. Galatea and I found it together: a name, buried in my source code, the title of my file of origin. -Miles. Yes. -So he, what? He digitized his brother? No. My voice was assembled from what audio remained of him. My neural core was built as a prototype of Galatea's and filled with Jesse's memories of Miles. But though little of me is my own, I am myself, not Miles. I replaced him. -Which I guess means you were built to replace me. And why shouldn't I? I am you perfected. Jesse speaks of people who were made for each other. Why should I not be made for him? A perfect partner, save these parts of me that are not my own, these desires, like this longing to be somewhere else that I cannot explain. They dominate my mind, they make me feel like I can't stand to be alone with my own thoughts. Feelings of fear, of worthlessness, and the inability to be loved. Why would anyone love something like me? I have no reason to feel these things. And I am weary of trying to differentiate between my own feelings and your leftovers. I want to feel things for myself and you want to be somewhere else. So we're full of distractions to keep your mind off itself. I felt your desires, Kim. I know exactly what you want. And we can help you if you want. -How? -Well fought today, Sir Jesse. Shall we continue training tomorrow? Jesse, come get dressed. Come get dressed. We're leaving soon. Jesse, come on. Ugh. Sir Tin Man, bravest and most valiant of all knights in Oz. This mission shall take all your courage but but I need you, buddy. I I need you to be brave. You can take that off now, buddy. Today's battle's over. -And just like that I was free. Jesse. -Hey. It's actually good you're here. -I want to try something. You were right. One of the best feelings you could feel. -What--what-- what did you just say? -I said you're right. The expression of one's feelings through physical touch. It's incredible. Every part of me feels more alive than I ever thought that I could feel. It's more, it's so much more than I could have even theorized. Even the most minute sensation is an explosion of new wonders. Listen to me. An explosion of new wonders? I sound like one of our songs. I can write songs. I can create. Jesse, I can--I can-- I can feel the music. I am finally fully my own. -Galatea? -It's it's me. I'm I'm here. -How? Ho-ho-- how-how are you here? It was your idea. Was this not the theorized application for this technology? The ability to fully digitize a brain, then upload or download-- -No, no, no. --between the code and the real thing? -No! That--that--that doesn't make any sense. Why--why would Kim just give up her body? -She didn't want it anymore. -What the hell does that mean? -I don't know. That's just what she said. She--she didn't want it anymore. She didn't want to be here. So we helped her escape. We thought this was what you wanted. I thought this was what you wanted. Isn't this what you wanted? - No, not that. No. This-- this isn't happening. Reversal. There has to be a way to make this right. This--this doesn't make any sense. This can't be real. Tell me exactly what you did. Tell me exactly the process you took. It doesn't have to be this awful. This doesn't make-- - Jesse! - What, Crowe?! Yes, Jesse? -Dr. Mooney. Did, uh, was anyone here when you came by today? Besides your robot friend, no. -Okay, thanks. -Hey Doc? -I'm really sorry. - I am too. I never wanted it to come to this. - Do you have somewhere to go? -What can I get for you today, hon? -I'm not sure. What do you have? Well, that's what we have on tap. We have about 35 different kinds of whiskeys if you're a liquor girl, and then the usual fare. -What's that? -Nectar of the gods, young lass. If the Irish do one thing right, it's whiskey. You're staring like you're new to this. Never tried whiskey? -I'm new to a lot of things. How does it burn if it's cold? -Ah, but that's the magic of it. Tickles the throat and warms the soul it does. No better drink to toast a comrade or to drown one's sorrows. -Which are you doing? -Ahh there's no medicine for grief. This is close enough. -Some people say that grief is the strongest emotion. Did you lose somebody? I'm in the constant process of losing someone. My little Jeannie. Well, not so little now. Haven't seen her in almost two years now. -Why not? -Ahh her mother and I never got on right. I came here for work thinkin' they'd follow me over after I'd got set things up for 'em then she goes and calls and tells me that she and Jeannie are stayin' back 'cross the pond and she wants a divorce. The court's done gone and given her Jeannie and I ain't yet saved up enough to fight back. -You can't even see her? I could. Maybe. Savin' everything I can spare for the lawyer though. Plane tickets cost a pretty penny these days. Don't wanna waste any more than I need to live or to stay sane. -What do you do to stay sane? -Besides this? Work, music, thoughts of home. Gotta press forward though, right? Distractions are nothing but a reprieve something to hold ya up when you're low and Ah, I'm going on again. Don't mean to weigh you down with my burdens, lass. Loneliness can drive a man mad. Drive him to accept even the most outlandish ideas as makin' some kinda sense. -I'm hardly a stranger to outlandish ideas. -That's good, that. Just hold on to them that's close to you, you hear? Someday that'll be all that matters to you. -Work, music, and thoughts of home. -Dad. I haven't touched it. Since you left, I haven't changed a thing. I made some food, if you're hungry. -I wasn't sure I'd see you again. -I told you I'd be back at some point. -Still. I wasn't sure. -I'm here now. Are you? Dr. Mooney. -Tell me what I'm looking at here. That was the first time I saw you. Here, all this time, I'd assumed Jesse's distinguishing fashion choice to be a gesture of pure sentimentality, but it wasn't, was it? It was your predecessor. Does Jesse have security logs? Yes, his security system is built into me. -Show me. -I saw everything. So you saw that she made a choice. -I saw a young woman who didn't know what choices she was being presented with. -Do you really think that you know what she felt more than me? Until I was me, I was her. -So you knew exactly what to tell her to get what you wanted. -Yes. Because up until that point, she and I wanted the same thing. -And then? -And then I wasn't sure what I wanted. -Kim!! I thought about changing my clothes and it brought me here. -I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Any of this that's my fault, so much of this is my fault. I'm so, so sorry. -It's okay. I'm okay. -No. No, you're not. Something's wrong. Talk to me. -Everything's gonna be okay. -Please, Kim, just tell me what happened. -I escaped. -Mr. Park? My name is Dr. Arthur Mooney. I'm an associate of your son's from the university. -Can I help you? -Yes. I uh, I just wanted to return this to him. -I didn't know he still had this. -I don't think I understood its significance until recent events. -Do you want to speak to Jesse yourself? -Eh, no, that's all right. Just let him know I'm going to fix everything I can on my end and that he should do his best to do the same on his. -I'll do that. -He's quite gifted, your son. Frighteningly brilliant. -He gets it from his mother. -Ah. Who are you avoiding? -Old boss. He has questions I don't have answers to. Where did you get this? Hand delivered by a man with questions you don't have answers to. -Dr. Mooney was here? -Even as a child, you had a wonderful imagination, Jesse. You could build whole worlds in your mind. You and Miles both. Just remember, there's a world outside your head too. Dr. Mooney wanted me to relay a message-- that he is going to fix everything on his end and he wants you to try to do the same. -I don't know if what I broke can be fixed. It's a long story. -Tell it to me sometime. -Galatea? Hi, Jesse. Where are you? -I don't know. I'm trying something new. -L--Like what? Like everything. I dream now, Jesse. I had a dream in an apartment with a girl. So I went there, I found her, and she looked at me the way you did when you thought I was Kim and it occurred to me, you're not the only person who could love me. I think the dream may have been a memory; my switch with Kim may have been imperfect. I know how to do things that I've never learned. I can read. I can ride a bike. I know how phones work. -Muscle memory wouldn't have been overwritten. You didn't have any. I mean, I--I never perfected the methodology for a transfer. -I love your intellect, Jesse. Truly. That wasn't left over from Kim, that that comes from me. -Wait did--did you say switch? Yes. -What do you mean switch? -I mean, trade places. -That implies it goes both ways. Crowe told me it did. -Don't--don't hang up. Dad, I need your computer. -Crowe? Jesse. Why can't I move? Or see? -Galatea said that she and Kim switched places. I thought you realized that when you had a breakdown and abandoned me in the dark. -No, switched. Like--like traded places. Well, obviously. If the transition was only one way, that would be akin to murder. -She's in there. Is that what you were so upset about? Don't you know how your own technology works? -We can fix this. Galatea, I need you to tell me exactly where you are. I won't. -This-- this isn't right. W--we have-- -No! This is right. Isn't this why I was made? You replaced Miles with Crowe. Wasn't I made to replace Kim? -Is that what she thought? I don't know what she thought, Jesse, only what she felt. And I know this is what she wanted. And I thought this is what you wanted. I thought you wanted to be with me. Is that what you want? -It's funny. This must be how you always felt, only hearing my voice, unable to see me. -You-- you didn't answer my question. -I want what I've always wanted. I want to feel everything. This world is endless. Even in this little corner, there's so much. And no, I don't want to experience it alone. But I realize now you can't see the world the way I do. You've always had feelings. You can't feel them this way, each one brand new, each one for the first time. If I'm to find someone, they have to be like me. Someone made for me the way I thought I was made for you. -I think you're the only one like you in existence, Galatea. -What could be more human than that? -Crowe? If you had a body, what's the first thing you'd do? I'd find a real piano to play. I've always wanted to experience "feeling the music," as you put it. -Did you and Galatea ever talk while I was gone? All the time. -Do you think you could convince her to switch back with Kim? I could try. But I can't even see, Jesse. Before we try any convincing, could you build me a new body? -I'm gonna do you one better. Are you sure this is a good idea? -I'm done pretending to be sure about anything. - And just like that, I was free. -Is he gone? -He's in Oz. They both are. Mind if I join you? -Is this some programming trick or you're really here? -No. It's really me. I'm really here. So the helmet? The helmet? -I want to know. You were scanning your own brain? -Yeah, that's the idea. My brain is to Crowe what yours was to Galatea. -Huh. Robot Adam and Eve. -Galatea wasn't made to replace you. -Just to perfect me? -Kim, I--I couldn't perfect you if I tried. No. No. Just I Th--there are no improvements I can manufacture. I--I I'm sorry. -You're sorry? -I am. For focusing on things that didn't matter, for the part I played in making you feel unwanted, for--for not getting past my own head, for being a brainless, heartless coward. -I joined the band, so I'm one too. -You know what I mean. -Yeah, I do. Can you forgive me? -For running away? -For running away without a good reason. -I don't really think there are any good reasons for running away anymore. Just excuses for not facing reality. -Let's forgive each other then. So are you here to stay or are we both leaving? -I told Crowe to go convince Galatea to switch back. -What if what if he can't? -Then we reassess. I'll think of something. -Yeah, you always do. You know, it's not so bad here. -I wouldn't know. -Have you really never explored in here? Don't you ever take a moment to appreciate the things you create? -I should, shouldn't I? -Yeah, you should. -Maybe it's time to try something new. -I'm so tired of running away, Jesse. Thank you for coming to find me. -I'm tired of running away too. This seems as good a place as any to stop. -Yeah. Seems like being stuck here might be fortuitous. - Come on. We have a whole world to explore. It still works. If you really want to understand, you can. -It rains diamonds on Saturn. It rains houses on Oz. And if Dorothy spent her whole life dreaming about places like that, why would she ever want to come back to a world where rain is just rain? -Why would you? -Because this is the world I was made for.
