Killing you was in my fate Some bastard erased it Pray, if you believe in God Your end is in my hands It is written in stone What did you say? No bastard will erase your death from my fate Gazing at the faraway sun, the lotus comes to flower Light rays may separate them, but their bond is strong Is it a bud? Or poisonous weed?

I lay buried with you in my heart The circling sun and moon come together in a line Abstinence and honesty lose their grip I die bit by bit Seeing the quiver of your lip O beloved, I implore you Give me your heart Standing on the other shore, longing to reach you A fruit that scorches is desired fruit all the same Veera, they're waiting for you Move along Veera is coming -How are you? -Go away!

Won't ten heads together equal him? Not even close What's he like? Good-looking? Handsome, no doubt What else would you expect? I must see him. At least once To see what he's like in person I should ask him why he met you first Is he loving? Does he make you laugh? And you... Do you love him? I feel jealous A burning ache deep inside Does your god feel jealous too? No. Only Veera does The downtrodden, the uncouth brute Not a match to you Or your God-like husband But jealousy has made me suddenly feel matchless It has made me suddenly feel invincible This demon of jealousy.. ...has made me all-powerful Where are you?

Your husband has sent me to find you Searched every inch of the forest Glad you're ok, Mrs. Inspector He gave me a keepsake. It is in my pocket What was that noise? Madam, here. Look behind you Trust me. I'll carry you away on my shoulders And take you to your husband Why didn't Dev come? He's five kms away His convoy makes such a ruckus, everyone knows when they move So I came up ahead Don't hesitate They are wild people. They aren't kind Say the word -We'll throw chilli in their eyes and escape -Oh God! Don't hurt him. You already have me captive I am going to slay him like a goat Will you throw chilli at us? Your death-knell too I hear many sounds The inspector's convoy is heading this way Watch out I may be from the Inspector's party But I'll vote for you Look around you They will do anything for you.

It will bark and then bite you Force a tree branch down and let go It will spring up with greater might What's new in your threats? We've heard it all before They hit us. We hit back They caned us. We did the same The bastards point guns at us now We'll snap your necks. Understand? Veera, I won't leave this place without madam Who said you were leaving? Eh? Brother! His end is near Get him a drink. Leave him at the cliff He'll roll down himself You're making a bad mistake He isn't against us. He's right Go to the Inspector then Get yourself a uniform Come back and plough me with bullets He's talking of peace Why be angry? With ten trucks of ammunition? Talking of peace? He's sniffing around to see if we're strong What is our strength? Shall I tell you? You are That strength is our weakness now I am observing, you are arguing with him Be quiet, brother I am asking you too Everything has gone wrong since she got here A curse has fallen on us The witch will burn us all You said she'd die in 14 hours. That became 14 days Not in 14 years he will let her go -Will you stop it? Why do you repeat it again? -Hit me You can hit me You dared to hit me But you don't dare question Veera You don't do anything. Let me go with the forest guard Make him see sense It is mistake going to the police It's mistake. Sending him alone is a mistake I'll go with him I'll go with him You can't open your mouth without swearing How can you talk peace? Brother, I am not a child.

Do I tell Veera you're ready to make peace? It's only a scratch Next time you won't be so lucky -Veera told me, but I didn't listen his words. -Don't run Hurry UP! A battle cry rings out Like angry seas, two great armies rush to the attack Deafening as thunder, chariots hurtle forward “An end to your arrogance. The battle has begun" Like angry seas, two great armies rush to the attack Deafening as thunder, chariots hurtle forward “A warless day is no day“ “He will come with an army and dethrone you" Hemanth, careful Keep coming and you'll die A round of applause! He isn't running. He's flying Where is Ragini? Where is my sister? Where is Vennila? Where is she? This is the day you'll die Say Your prayers “The virtuous tumbling to hell" Come, sweetheart No gun, no uniform, no back up Just you and me Come to me Veera, let go Let him plummet to his death Screaming Where is he?

There he is Amazing. Slithering like a snake Do me a favour Only Gods do favours. Not demons Don't kill Dev Come up and face me alone I'll let go -Only one beast can survive -I can shoot you Who do you bet on? Think I'd give you a loaded gun? I have always wondered who would end up killing me Shoot me... ...and, in a few minutes... ...the turmoil and the suffering Everything will be snuffed out Aim here. And in an instant... Memory Love Desire. Your very life All gone. In one go Painless Looking at you, I'll die contented With a smile on my face And if I stayed, will you spare him? Will you stay? Are you sure? What are you doing? You have a beard? A 14-day growth? You should've come for me in 14 minutes You had me scared I'm back now At last, I came to you Where is he? Why do you ask? I'm here What more do you want? Where's he hiding? Did you come for me? Or Veera? He left you here and escaped Let it go I'll be back Take me home Let's go home Did he hit you? Did he threaten you? No Did he touch you? What happened that shouldn't have? They kept you for 14 days 14 days and 14 nights I know what you're asking Look at me. Can't you tell? Will you take a lie detector test? We'll soon know How dare you talk like that? If you aren't lying, why does the test bother you? I just about survived 14 days Now I wish that I were dead The truth is sometimes harsh How do you know the truth? He told me Who told you? What? My hands may be defiled But your wife is not pure as gold She's sullied Impossible. I don't believe it He couldn't have said that He said a lot more. Shall I go on? StOP I'm getting off this train Don't threaten me Are you throwing me out of your life? I don't like your lies I never lie, Dev But you're lying now Your face... all lies Your body... more lies It shows in your eyes You shouldn't have come back Even if I knew where Veera was, I shouldn't tell you But you're asking me to take you to him I don't know why you came back If you are still angry on him, kindly go home Let Veera keep the regard he has for you I don't know how long you'll have to wait I've left you something to eat You're back What did you tell Dev about me? I'm out of breath. I really can't hear you I can't hear you? Am I the weapon to defeat him? I'm dizzy with happiness Don't be harsh What did you tell Dev? What did you say? Tell me Hey, Veera Let him plummet to his death He'll die screaming Hold on tight I could kill you to win your wife And I could spare you for her Shall I leave you or save you? Shall I leave? What did you say about me? You have a wife, pure as gold Throw gold into fire.. ..It becomes purer Our hands may be defiled But we have... ...protected your wife with great care What else did you tell him? Take her and go before I change my mind Hold Come yourself up Veera is so happy, how can you be upset? Were you captive for only 14 days? Only 14 days? Why do 14 days sometimes feel like a lifetime? I didn't feel so bad when I sent you back, blindfolded But why do I feel such happiness today? No tears Swallow those tears I don't like women crying if eel alive again I can breathe again Dev said vile things. He didn't heed a word I said Why did he talk like that? Without any reason? -He distrusts me -Distrusts you? The Inspector? Well done! Dev isn't here Dev, you're so devious Dev doesn't know I'm here He really knows how to get to me Come out Show yourself I told you I'd come back Go on, shoot Shoot me Not once. You'll have to shoot me ten times A hundred times Shoot me Shoot me! Ragini, move You can't destroy my happiness Move You can't destroy it Move I will come again Come back to follow you Is life a mere scribbling of a child.. ...in which meaning is sought? Life changes and ends when the meaning is unraveled
