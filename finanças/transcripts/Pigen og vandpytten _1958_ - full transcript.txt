Miss Greendahl? Miss Mai? Miss Mai? Mrs. Stella from the fashion salon is out there with the bill. Dang it! Mrs. Hammer, I have no money. Say I'm gone. - I did. She won't believe it. - Does she think we're lying? Tell her to come back in an hour. At least I'm gone then. Mai? Shhh! Mrs. Stella is out there with the bill. She's still an optimist, huh? Hurry up or you'll be late again. I'll be there in five minutes. Yes, dear, I have heard it before, but Mai Greendahl is not at home. She is auditioning at the theatre. Is she? Over at the theater they say she is at home. This is at least the sixth time I've been here. It doesn't go any further. All my guests can hear you. If the girl child were to wear clothes she had paid for, - - she didn't have a piece on her body. Possibly, but she's not home. Well. Then I'll wait here. But... At some point she must come. Or go. May I invite you to a cup of coffee at my place? No thanks. I'll wait here. And for the information of both you and her, I can tell you, - - that my headmistress is standing by the kitchen door. That is excellent. May I not shorten the waiting time by playing a little for you? come may you sweet mil... Apparently it wasn't that good. come may you sweet... It was too loud. come May you sweet mild make the forest green again and let creek and... Stop! Stop! I don't quite know what key to play in. For my sake, you can play it in Q minor. Just you will be finished. Then I'd rather play someone else. fly bird, fly... Stop. I get goosebumps all over my goosebumps. Dang it! - Can't you look out yourselves? - Sorry, I didn't see the puddle. I will of course pay for a cleaning. May I drive you home? No, rather to the Phoenix Theatre. I should have been there fifteen minutes ago. Farm boy! Do you think you drive a radio car? - Isn't it 82 Andersen? - Isn't it 44 Moeller? Hello, you old man. Yes, it is all too rare that we old war comrades meet. How did the little gift package you saw? I never see her again. She got married. - With whom? - With me. (car horn) - What happened here? - Nothing. Can two war comrades not be allowed to meet? I must ask for your names. Poul Moeller. Shipowner Thorbjoern's chauffeur. - Good morning, Lasse. Have they started? - Yes. The director is looking for you. Then I get into trouble again. but despite all the technique the club of the inventions the ball over the stream of life however, the woman is and will be the best that has yet ever been invented think how there is thought of the woman has everything it takes you freeze then she opens her warm arms her two little eighthparts looks perfect in silhouette but can also be used when you are tired if we go further down she has two slender legs so she can wiggle away when she is going home to one oh, how there's thought of everything even her mouth that speaks is away you can just close it with a kiss by night and day The woman is actually delivered so practical that one must take off the hat The woman is actually delivered so practical that one must take off the hat Yes, thanks. Thanks. Brilliant, Peter. You are amazing. Thanks for today. But the ladies... If I remember correctly, I have engaged ten ballerinas - - and not ten sleep-drunk, feeble-minded virgin pavers. This is not an asphalt ball in the meat town. It's revue. Revue with charm, sex, temperament and pang. Let me show you how to do it. Music! So, ladies. Grace... Grace and balloon. Graceful movements all the time. And the big jumps here and there. Such... there you go. The most important thing is the smile. Smile, dammit! It's serious. What are you laughing at? The director said that we should stand and giggle. Well, not at me. Good morning. Are you already there? Sorry I'm late but... Thanks. Mai Greendahl, You have been here since you were a student, - - and you don't understand, - - that theater work, in addition to talent and energy, requires precision. I... Aren't you pestering me incessantly about getting a leading role? Do you think I give leading roles to people, - - who keeps management and staff waiting for over half an hour? On the way here I met with an accident. Did you really? I am sorry... ... to inform you that you will now face an even bigger accident. - Do you know what you are? - No. They are fired. You can collect your pay immediately. Immediately on Friday. Thursday Friday... The thirteenth. We have 700 seats on the floor and 400 on the balcony. - How much does it give? - Let me see... 1100 seats per day and 300 playing days per year - - that's 333,000 tickets sold at an average price of ten crowns. It will be DKK 3,330,000. After all, it's a scam... ugh, dizzying sums. How big are your average boxes? We have no average boxes. Record boxes only. Moment. The ticket office? Yes, it is me. How are the sales tonight? We have sold 42 tickets and handed out 800 free tickets. A good 800 tickets have therefore been sold - - and distributed 42 free tickets? Well, let's go. - It will probably sell out. - They misunderstood me... But you must not hand out any more free tickets today. It's a custom with free tickets, - - but it is difficult to say no to members of the press and actors. But to return to reality... ... how much could the manufacturer think of shooting into the revue? They mentioned 50,000 themselves. That's probably over the top. Be careful, I won't force you to make money. I am interested, - - but I would like to take a quick look at the manuscript. The script? Then I have a better idea. I ask the author Boerge Arvidsen to look this up. - Boerge Arvidsen? - Yes. Look right up here. Manufacturer Munk would like to hear a bit about the revue. May I offer you a cigar? No, thanks. I don't think I'll smoke any more cigars. Thank God. I mean that's sensible of you. It's not even that easy. It takes more money than you think. DKK 40,000 for decorations, 6,000 for shoes and 30,000 for costumes. These are amounts that add up. - And that money has already been paid? - Yes, of course. Rub and blunt. Here everything is paid in cash. But I'm young in the industry, - - so temporarily I could use DKK 50,000. There are still expenses for advertisements, posters, orchestra rehearsals... Author's fee. Boerge Arvidsen. - Monk. - Manufacturer. Author. I would like to disturb the director. He sits in a meeting. You don't need that either. As long as we get our money. Of course you have to have your money, but why does it have to be right now? We already owed you money for years without paying. Yes, exactly. But we will talk to the director. - He is sitting with his new financier. - We give him two more minutes. Goodbye. The genius of my ... our revue is, - - that it is based on the plot, the portrayal and the climax. - The climax? - It's the highlight. The highlight? Well, a mountain landscape. I won't say that now. Nah, it's an abstract highlight. - What is abstract? - It is something that is not there. The revue therefore consists of the layout, the personal description - - and a mountain landscape that isn't there? No, no. Well, but the sketch... There are four men sitting on a raft. It is about getting everyone involved at once. So all the people in the theater have to get on the raft at once? There isn't room for everyone on a raft. So there are three men on a raft. They then said there were four. One has fallen into the water and been eaten by a shark. - You could have said that. - That's the surprise. The element of surprise is the most important thing in a sketch. So there are four men on a raft. No, there were three. One fell into the water. There are four sitting. Because I have started all over again. Then we must have lifted the man up, and he must have gotten wet. - Don't you think he'll catch a cold? - Then we give him some dry clothes to wear. It's not worth it, because he has to go in again in a little while. There are four men sitting on a raft. How did they get him back up? He was eaten by a shark. I do not know. They must have raised the shark, too. What is this way to take it? I come from a home with a piano. There are four sharks on a raft, - - and then one man goes crazy and jumps into a shark... ... in the water. What's his name? We can say that his name is... ... Rasmussen. I know him. It's my mother's brother. There are probably several others named Rasmussen. He was an only child. It doesn't matter what his name is. Does it matter what my uncle's name is? No, because he has nothing to do with the story. Aha. Sorry for cursing. Why the hell does he have to go up on that raft? - He fell into the water. - Then he'll drown. No. That's what's funny. - Rasmussen cannot sink. - Why not? Because he has strep throat. Then he shouldn't have been on that trip at all. Don't you think it's funny? No, it's like the sketch isn't finished. People are waiting for a doctor to come in. I'm not well. For my sake. Let a doctor come in at the end. All right. A doctor enters the picture. He prescribes sea air, and the patient is sent out on a raft. Yes. And then you can play the whole sketch once more. It's really funny. I agree with DKK 50,000. - May I be allowed to go now? - Yes. Yes. I am going to the doctor. - Do you want to sign a contract? - With pleasure, Mr. Manufacturer. (voices) I will not be disturbed. He said what he wanted to say when he said something. Our patience is over. We want our money now. If you wait outside, it will all be sorted. It seems as if they had money to their credit. Money for good with me? Yes. - I have DKK 40,000 to my credit. - And I have DKK 32,786. And 24 cents. Dear friends... Either we get our money, or we also take decorations and costumes with us. - Are you the new financier? - Should have been, but didn't make it. Thanks. Thank you, thank you. You're welcome. Paper-monkeys! You ruined it for yourselves and for me. I had a fat, giant-sized cod on the hook, - - and then you cut the cord. - How are we going to get the premiere? - If I may...? - Good morning, Lasse. - Good morning. - Where do I meet Mai Greendahl? - She is no longer employed here. She was supposed to pick up her pay today, so I'll wait here. Good morning, Lasse. Are there any letters? No, not today. Let's see the sample list. - Will I meet Mai Greendahl? - What is it about? I am shipowner Erik Thorbjoern's chauffeur. I have a message for her. Unfortunately, she hasn't arrived yet. Then I'll come back later. - Erik Thorbjoern! - Is she dating him? Have you seen his cart? You don't have to tell Mai Greendahl that I've been here. Shipowner Thorbjoern. Then one can probably take it easy. She's seeing together with Erik Thorbjoern. Mai is dating Erik Thorbjoern. Thorbjoern. It is true. She dates Erik Thorbjoern. It is true. That's really enough. They have been engaged for many years. Shipowner Thorbjoern. He is a multi-millionaire. I got it. Tell her to come up here immediately. - Well, she has been fired. - Who the hell fired her? I dare not say that. Find out where she lives. Get her out. Dead or alive. Address of Miss Greendahl... It's not there. It's not there either. Address of Miss Greendahl... Address of Miss Greendahl... - I had to pick up my paycheck. - I'm busy. Can I help? I need to find Miss Greendahl's address. It is Miss Greendahl, after all. They must go in to the director. I must have my money. I would rather not speak to the director. In immediately. Welcome, said Miss Mai. Where have you been? - I've stopped... - They haven't even started yet. Sit down. We have to make a new contract. Block, download a form. - Will you engage me again? - Yes, of course. For now for one year. With extension. And the gag. Would you be satisfied with 2,000 a month? Yes. Will you write 2,000 a month, a year's commitment, - - and Mai Greendahl will only play lead roles. I do not understand... A theater director's foremost task is to give young people a chance. If they have talent, energy and, above all, precision. And I have been able to observe these qualities in you over the years. Have you? Will Miss Greendahl put her name there? Greendahl doesn't look out of place on a poster. They must have a stage name. Greendahl... Green... Grin... Grin... - Greenrhine? - Nonsense. Spruce... I have it: Granner. Mai Granner. Block, announce to the press that we have engaged a new star, Mai Granner. Well I... I will not take up your time. - They mustn't keep him waiting. - Him? I know it all. But we will return to that. And you can safely rely on my discretion. Goodbye, Mai Granner. And luck, luck with it all. - Thank you very much for the new contract. - Greet him many times. (the phone is ringing) Hello? Is it the printer? I don't have time to talk to you. We need the text for that poster. A moment. What do they say? Mai Granner? Mai Granner. And she must be in bold. What is the revue called? I do not have time. I'll call later. We have to have the title or we can't get it. Screw you! "Screw you!" He's parked down in the yard. Is it them? Do you remember our little gathering? The police have taken a report, and I want to ask you to testify in the case. May I drive you home so we can talk about it on the way? Yes, but can we stop at NorthBridge Street? I have to talk to an angry lady. There you can see for yourself. Now maybe you are convinced? Good day my sweet girl. Good day, Mrs. Stella. Now you will soon receive your money. It is not urgent. Thanks. That's sweet of you. - Something wonderful has happened. - I know it all. - Already? - You can't hide anything from me. I am so happy. And I will probably afford to buy something new. That was all that was missing, my sweet girl. If I had known, you would never have been allowed to wear the old dresses. Now I'll take care of your clothes, and you don't have to think about the payment. I know how this sort of thing is done. Problems? Does this bill go to the shipowner's private account? Can I see? I'll send for you later. "Party dress: DKK 816. 12 pairs of nylon socks, - - 6 pieces of bra model Skyview: DKK 216. A dozen nylon panties model Brigitte Bardot: DKK 160 - - and a roll of sewing silk: 48 cents. A total of DKK 2,296.48." From Maison Stella. 16-24. They talk to shipowner Thorbjoern. I would like to speak to Mrs. Stella. They have sent me a bill for various... ... clothing items for the actress Mai Greendahl. Yes. And I hope the shipowner is satisfied. Didn't she look adorable? There is no point in dressing a girl who is so charming. Is she? Well listen here... What a ravishing figure she has. And she can't hide her crush on you at all. Can't she? As I told your fiancé, you can count on my discretion. Thank you very much. How gracious. My mouth is shut with seven sails, Mr. Shipowner Thorbjoern. I hope so too. We have adjusted the suit. Should it be sent home or over to the Phoenix Theatre? Finally do that. Thanks. Goodbye, Mrs. Stella. - Miss Thomsen, do you want to come in here? - Yes. Isn't the Phoenix Theater on Easter Boulevard? - Yes, that... - It works. Miss Thomsen. I will not meet again today. - Yes... - Mr. ship owner. Now you have to see how it should be done. I do not understand it. - You don't know the shipowner at all? - I have no idea what he looks like. You got the contract because the director thinks you and Thorbjoern are engaged. It's terrible. Who started that rumor? I, myself have seen you being picked up by his private chauffeur. I saw a car accident he was in, - - and he just asked me to testify. Think that nothing more is needed. I tell the director the truth. You must not be so foolish. Now you finally have the chance to show what you're capable of. After all, it wasn't you who asked for the contract. If you fail, you can give it back again. What if the ship owner hears the rumor? How was he supposed to do that, though? Such a man is always out traveling. I have called a press conference. The first is from Morning Gazette. Show him to Mai. The others you send up to me. - Now remember, her name is Granner. - Yes, Mr. Director. Good day. I was supposed to talk to Mai Greendahl. Mai Groendahl is not named Greendahl. After she became a star, her name was Mai Granner. The wardrobe is at the end of the corridor on the left. I even go to the sewing room with it. Now we let the bomb go off. The press will come shortly. Journalist Palmer will be here shortly. Go show him some legs. Give him a moving story about your poor childhood. - What should I say? - Something that creates sympathy. Say you had to sell your dollhouse to get medicine for your aunt. Good luck. Mai, the sewing room needs your costume now. Can't you see that smoking is prohibited? Step on it. - Does the post not appeal to you? - No, I'm the one who set it up. (there's a knock on the door) I had to talk to Mai Granner. - It is me. Come on in. - Thanks. I'm going straight to the sewing room. I'll be back in a moment. Twelve dozen. 900 crowns. Six pieces: DKK 216. Model Skyview. Sorry...I mean... It does not matter. - Don't you want to sit? - Yes, thank you very much. I guess we'd better get started. Will you or shall I begin? Begin? On what? The interview. Aren't you a journalist at the Morning Gazette? Yeah, shame on me. - Your name is Palmer, isn't it? - Yes, I have been called that for several years. I had imagined you differently. I have to say the same. - Are you disappointed? - Are they? On the contrary. I guess I'd better start if you're ready to write. Well, of course. Yes... I come from a poor homestead on the Jutland heath. We were seven siblings, - - and already as a four-year-old I had to join in the field. - Are there beets on the heath? - Yes, what? Yes, back then there was. Now it's all cultivated, so now there aren't that many anymore. Mai Granner descends from a fine, aristocratic family. She spent her happy childhood at the family's manor, Grannerholm. Where is it? The castle burned down during the war. - What war? - The Thirty Years War. So they sat in it for a while during the war? Yes. I know it sounds awfully dramatic… ... but I had to sell medicine - - to be able to buy a doll's house for my sick aunt. Yeah? In fact, this is how my entire existence has taken shape. It has been difficult at times. Has no one helped you out? Have you not had influential contacts? What do you mean? Are you referring to someone in particular? After all, there are whispers in the corners about shipowner Thorbjoern. There is nothing between us. We are just good friends. - Where did you meet him? - At a dinner party last winter. - He was in Egypt last winter. - Yes, that's where I met him. Yeah? What a mood you get when the moon rises behind the pyramids. - Can't you see it all for yourself? - Yes, who had just been there. Mai Granner and the shipowner met romantically in China. He was in the Mediterranean on his yacht. He started in the Mediterranean and sailed further east. Mai Granner had just arrived in Hong Kong - - to visit her sick aunt. In the shadow of the Great Wall their fates met, - - while Japanese cherry trees ... flowers sprinkled over them. It's drug, huh? I know there is sensationalism in the rumours, - - but don't write anything about it. There is nothing between us. You believe me, don't you? Yes, you have convinced me and I promise not to write anything. (there's a knock on the door) - Mai, you are going on stage now. - I'm just going to change my clothes. Well, but... I guess I'd better retreat then. There is much else I would like to have asked you about. Perhaps we can continue the conversation, I mean the interview, - - in slightly more pleasant forms. Do you want to have dinner with me tonight? Yes, thanks, when I'm done with the test. We could meet in the small restaurant next to the theatre. - Shall we say eight o'clock? - Fine. That's a deal, then. - See you later. - See you later. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hi Lis, how are you? Hey, Palmer. We have trials both night and day. I have to interview a Mai Granner. Who the hell is that? That's Mai Greendahl. She has played the maid for the last eight performances. But now that she is engaged to Thorbjoern, - - the director has opened his eyes to her great talents. It's a damn good story. Tell, tell. Don't say you got it from me. small mirror on the wall tell me What should I wear to a rendezvous? with one I have neither seen or known or met yet you want to be a girl appear as flattering as possible especially when you have to go out and meet a strange man how about a little rouge and a little blue eyes, that's what a man wants a bottle of Chanel always works well but which lipstick should I take now? small mirror on the wall I choose this safe kiss-me-cyclock guy look here now I can go on adventure only if I knew him then it was no problem Am I the type he's looking for? Men have different tastes small mirror on the wall tell me do you think he wants me with long legs maybe he'd rather met a low-stemmed little one or one with chubby cheeks or with a charming gooseneck which he can kiss gently in the middle of a gentle waltz if he has conceived a lovely bosom like Brigitte Bardot then I'm ready on my windowsill You have to please them small mirror on the wall be honest Now tell me what he wants how do you think he wants me most of all small mirror on the wall I choose to meet him as I walk and stand if you want to see me Mr. I come as I am - What do you want? - I do not know. - What could you think? - I haven't decided yet. It would probably be easier if you turned the card over. Waitor? Waitor? Waitor? Waitor? - Shall we start with shrimp cocktails? - Yes, thanks. Sounds wonderful. - Two shrimp cocktails. - Yes. I saw you at the test this afternoon. They were radiant. Thanks. Only now it's going well. It's a great chance I've been given. Last winter I had to take on an extra job in a business. In Egypt? Wasn't that where you met the shipowner last winter? Yes, it was. What does he really look like? He is nevertheless very ordinary. Is he dark or light? Big or small? He is neither one nor the other. - Maybe he's bald? - Yes. He is rather bald and also a bit fat. A small, fat, bald man with big glasses. I know the type. Thanks. Thank you Mr. Head Waiter. Weird with that rumor. But... ... how did your real fiance take it? Is it the Morning Gazette's readers or yourself who are interested? If I'm being completely honest, it's actually me. Then I must also be honest and tell you that... ... that there is no one. So maybe you'll never see the shipowner again? - Yes, we see each other once in a while. - Are you doing it? I have promised to call him now about tickets to the premiere. He's probably out to eat with a lovely girl. No, he's waiting for my call. Will you excuse me for a moment? We would like two tournedos and a bottle of Chateau Margot 47. - Chateau Margot 47? - Yes. - What kind of broadcast is it? - I do not know. Do you know? - Do you know? - Nah. - That was fast. - Yes, he is always so busy. - But he wants to come to the premiere. - That was funny. I am sorry that the lady was not able to connect, - - but unfortunately the phone has been broken all day. Is that it? There was nothing wrong when I called. They are obviously a well-connected girl. Now stop teasing me. I think we'll be more comfortable if we forget about the shipowner. It won't be easy for me. Cheers. Cheers. Thanks for tonight. It has been lovely. - You too. See you tomorrow? - Maybe. When? - I have a break between twelve and one. - Then I'll be there at exactly twelve o'clock. Good night. Good night. Good morning. - What on earth is that? - Yes, it looks like a poster. - What does it say? - "Screw you with Mai Granner." Is it completely impossible to entrust anything to anyone? It was the director himself who... - Glasses! - Yes. Yes. "There is excitement in theater circles about a debut, - - which will soon take place at the Phoenix Theatre. Mai Granner has been given the lead role in the theatre's new revue. Her name is often mentioned in connection with one of the big taxpayers, - - the well-known shipowner Erik Thorbjoern. And it seems that there is romance in the air. Her sudden appearance - - does not, however, have to be in direct contact with Thorbjoern." - It is signed E.P. - Erik Palmer. - What's up with Palmer? - You'd better read it yourself. I'm not the one who said anything. Erik Thorbjoern will in all likelihood become the theatre's new financier. It sounds incredible. When will it be decided? Tonight, when the shipowner together with his fiancee - - will dine with me at Ambassadeur. If you wish, I shall gladly present you to him. Anyone can say that. I have no idea what he looks like. - Well, I do. - Then we'll come. - If you'd rather go to bed early. - We will be there. Fine. (the phone is ringing) Excuse me. Hello? Yes, it is... From ship owner Thorbjoern? Yes, of course. A moment. It is the shipowner's private chauffeur. - Block! - Did the director call? Thorbjoern's driver is on the phone. He wants to talk to Mai. Tell her to look in here afterwards. - Here are all the posters. - Thanks. I must compliment you on the poster. That title sells tickets. Does it do it? It is also my own idea. I said to myself: "What will the revue be called?" And then suddenly it was there. Bang! Here you go. Hello? Yes, it's Mai Granner. They couldn't spare half an hour today, could they? The police would like to have the witness statement confirmed. - I have a break at twelve o'clock. - Can I pick you up? I actually had another appointment... No, you just came at twelve o'clock. Bye for now. Then it's up to the director. Come. Welcome, Miss Mai. These are two of my best friends. The decorative painter Svend Aasgaard - - and the Danish Dior, Mrs. Esther Brydeblom. This is the theatre's new prima donna, Mai Green... Granner. - Block, get those posters up. - Where up? - On the facade. - The director asked me to mess with them. You must not peel anything but the cotton wool out of the ears, so that you can listen. - We are looking forward to tonight. - Tonight? You remember our agreement with the shipowner on Ambassadeur? But? - Yeah. - Fine. Well, I guess we're done as far as that goes. Goodbye, Mrs. Brydeblom. Goodbye, Mr. Aasgaard. It was sweet of you to look in. Goodbye. As you can understand, I have certain difficulties. They must ask Thorbjoern to come to dinner at Ambassadeur. Impossible. He must be in a meeting. - Then he has to cancel. - It can not be done. Otherwise, I can say goodbye to the theater and you to your career. The Shipowner is the absolute last card in my hand. It is impossible. All right. So it has happened. I might as well see the truth in the eyes. The game is lost. I have been fighting to keep the pieces together. I have pawned everything I own to raise money. But now I can't take it anymore. There is too much to fight against. And no one lifts a finger to help one. I'll try to persuade the ship owner to come tonight. Will you? Thank you. You won't regret it. Take the rest of the day off, and do everything to get it sorted. - Thanks for last night. Here you go. - No thanks. Sure, we have a lot to talk about, but that can't be said with flowers. - Small, unattractive leaf blowers. - I do not understand? Nor did I when I read your mention of my private life. I didn't write that. It's all a misunderstanding. Yes, you are so eternally right about that. Goodbye, Mr. Palmer. I have another appointment. But? Did you promise the director to show up tonight - - in Ambassadeur at eight o'clock with shipowner Thorbjoern? - Where can you do something like that? - The premiere depends on it. The creditors demand to speak to Thorbjoern. Then you have to invite him. I risk that his solicitor will call me when he has read the Morning Gazette. - How does he look? - Have no idea. - Apparently not many do. - Perfect. Then we just have to find someone who can play the part for one evening. What have I gotten myself into? You have to dig yourself out of that again. A married man who dances around with one of the Phoenix Theatre's pinups. - And in my car. - But... See what rumors you've started. Associate my name with such a tramp. I have nothing to do with Mai Granner, - - in addition to the fact that she was a witness to a driving accident I had. - Is that really all? - Yes. Thank you. I must say. Then the matter is in perfect order. I get the Morning Gazette to deny the rumour. No, no. Such a rumor must be allowed to die in silence. - Shall I drive you? - No, I'll take the small one. Now that Palmer wants to help you, I don't think you should hold a grudge. Then we say it. At least for now. Can I play a small, fat, bald man with glasses? - Bald? - That's how you described him. The hair may have grown out. There are so many preparations. All right. - But why doesn't he come himself? - He is traveling. - In Egypt again? - This time he is in Paris. Paris? He can easily. It should work, Palmer. You just have to remember that your name is Erik Thorbjoern. And then you must try to move and behave, - - as if you were a millionaire. Isn't it better that we try? Then we can see how you play a superior, smug money matador. I guess I'll just have to sprinkle money around me. No, no, my director pays for it all. You just have to sit and talk about your travels, - - luxury cars, country houses and yachts. - Thorbjoern always does that. - Does he? Well, let's try it. James... a little fire. (laughter) Ask Alex to drive the cart forward. I'm going up to the estate. Ask them to put twelve bottles... ... champagne on ice. There will be two of us for dinner. Also tell me that my son was furious about... ... that there was no Russian caviar in the school lunch today. - Radiant. - Well done. - Where did you learn that? - Journalists meet many people. - What about the dressing? - Can you get a tuxedo? My servant arranges it... I mean, my brother arranges it, who is a servant, he can borrow me one. - I put on my new party dress. - The one for 900 crowns? What? I did not say anything. Well, we will meet as agreed. Farewell so long, Mr. Shipowner. Yes, it was very funny. I have reserved a table for the ship owner, Mai and myself. They show them up to me. Now follow along, Block. - Block. - They said "go along." Try to think about something else for once. I'm ready. The bloodsuckers come a quarter of an hour later. You also receive them here. And stay in the background. Call me when they come. So I stay in the foreground in the back hall. Block! Remember who you are. And act as cultured as possible. I will do my best. But how well do we know each other? - Do we kiss on the mouth or on the cheek? - Neither. - But we're 'dus,' aren't we? - Let go. - My name is Mai. - Erik. - And then you usually kiss each other. - Now take it seriously. I'll go my way if I don't get the kiss I deserve. Well... Well, God, it's Mai. Not me Mai but you Mai. So it's the theater owner, uh, the ship owner? - Erik Thorbjoern. - Rasmus Frederik Christian Block. S'il vous plet. Who is the lady the ship owner is with? I'm sorry, Mr. Baron, but I don't know her. Will you ask the shipowner to come to our table so we can greet him? Good evening, Mr. Shipowner. A table was to be ordered for the director of the Phoenix Theatre. Yes, there is that too. - Pretend you don't know me. - Well. I'm pretending to be someone else tonight. Do I wonder who the shipowner imagines? - Shipowner Erik Thorbjoern. - Yes. - Good evening, Mr. Shipowner. - Good evening, Madame Baroness. It was a long time ago. This is the actress Mai Granner. Mrs. Baroness Grunenskjold. Thank you for the invitation to your garden party. The Baron and I rejoice. We always have a good time at the country house. - Thank you very much and see you again. - See you later. Do you get along with Baronesses? No, I gave her a fifty to play along. She is no more a baroness than I am a shipowner. It's hilariously invented. You get the money from me afterwards. Welcome, sweet friends. Here you go. Then I would like to welcome and thank you, - - because you accepted my invitation. Do you want to pop the champagne? I have always wanted to meet one of the leading representatives of cultural life. I am glad that you are also looking for contact with the world of art. Your father was extremely interested in the theater - - and often lent a helping hand when things got tough. I have always taken pride in living up to my father's traditions. (clears throat) Although sometimes it can be difficult. It must be difficult to have to take over the responsibility for, - - that so much money is still breeding. My father always said he had a bigger smile - - of the money he gave away than the money he earned. I am glad that you will follow his example. Why must men always talk business? Forgive me, beloved. I hope the director will come to that garden party, - - I'm staying at my country house next week. - With the greatest pleasure. - Take the whole ballet with you. Yes, and the rest of the staff. - Excuse me. - No trouble. You invite guests to an estate that does not exist. I had to impress him. You must withdraw the invitation. I'm going to hang on to it. You don't want me to invite him to some sausages on the Town Hall Square? Dear friends, a very warm welcome. Unfortunately, you cannot sit at my table. We are precisely discussing the shipowner's investment in the revue. Is he really here? You can believe that. And he is my husband. He eats here. Where does he eat? Block, would you like to invite our friends to a fancy supper? And then I unfortunately have to withdraw. - I would like to greet the ship owner. - Later, Mr. Aasgaard. See you later. You are sweet. I'm glad I met you. - Why did you write that article? - It wasn't me. - Why was your name so underneath? - You won't believe me anyway. Sorry if I kept you waiting. Unfortunately, I have to withdraw the invitation I gave you earlier. I had completely forgotten that the main building is to be demolished. - I see. - It must be moved closer to the lake. Fantastic. In return, maybe you and your staff would like a trip on my new yacht? - It will go on a test drive next week. - Thank you very much, Mr. Shipowner. But what was it that we got away from before? Yes, you said you would possibly put some money into theatre. - Did I say that? - Yes. - Yes, if an opportunity turns up. - I would like to help you. Couldn't you drop by my office tomorrow morning? - Unfortunately I cannot. - Then tomorrow afternoon? Sorry, but I'm busy with meetings all day tomorrow. It would like to be before the premiere tomorrow evening at eight o'clock. Yes, for your own sake. Then I'll try to see if I can be there at seven o'clock. Then we have an hour. It should just be possible. - Are you sure it's Thorbjoern? - Yes, there is no doubt. I know how he looks. - It was a happy piece of information. - Yes, an extra scoop on the soup. Therefore, it is not certain that we will get our money. The director is not one to mess with. Waitor? I think we'll kill the soup. My office manager is sitting over there with two representatives of the press. I think they would like to greet the shipowner and Mai Granner. - It seems that we will get the money. - The ship is loaded with money. You have to take the press into account. Excuse me for a moment. I read for the rest about my romantic Mediterranean cruise in Japan, - - where the cherry blossoms sprinkled over the Great Wall of China. Yes, isn't it incomprehensible where they get their information from? I do not understand it. Thanks for the help. It was well done. Just cut them off. Here is an additional ten. What are you doing? I just wanted to see if you were hot for me. Try again (sizzling) Can you tell I'm hot like a volcano? - Did the volcano have a good night? - Yes. Don't you have? Yes. But I am terrified at the thought of tomorrow. - You will succeed. - That's not what I'm thinking about. The director thinks he's getting money from you. And when that doesn't happen, there will be no premiere. I promise there will be a premiere. You promised not to write about Thorbjoern and me. Beloved... Then I will tell you everything. - I did not write that article. - Who has then? - Palmer, and I'm not at all... - To be trusted. - Yes I am. Listen here... - Leave me alone. Well... "There are great expectations for the premiere at the Phoenix Theater tonight. The director has pulled out all the stops to make the revue a sensation." Well done. "The cast offers exciting moments. Continued next page." "Continued next page." "The field is no less than 12, - - and Joy The Great is the favourite, - - while Asta is an outsider after getting spat in the front legs. Continued page six." "Continued on page six." "In the final you will see the Australian Mortimer, - - which, with its leading servers, will probably take care of, - - that there will be good duels on the back line. Over 20,000 spectators are expected." How do we fit them all in? - Block! - Here I come. Twentyfour... Just help me. We must be ready before the ship owner arrives. If we play to full houses every night, - - we were to earn 200,000 a month. I think the director has been talking too much. - What do they say? - Can I see? - What is that number? - The 180,000 is the ticket revenue. 180000... no, that is Mrs Brydeblom's telephone number. Who wrote it there? It costs me 180,000. Then we are down to 20,000. The mean harp. We don't give up. This time we want our money. - We go up to the office. - Yes. It is now half past eight and we have not received the costumes yet. (there's a knock on the door) Welcome. Thanks for yesterday. It was a festive evening. It was your own fault. Excuse the delay. The performance will probably start soon. We are only waiting for you. I promised you a part in the show. Even if I want to disappoint my old, faithful financiers. - Well then, we'll postpone it... - Not to mention. A word is a word. - Then let's write that check. - Fine. - I think you sit better here. - Thanks. - You don't have a fountain pen, do you? - Yes, of course. Let's see... Should we say... 75,000? It was not quite the amount I had thought. No, that is also far too much. I probably can't get you such a large part either. - Maybe I can manage 50,000? - No, you know what? So 30,000 then? Should we say 30,000? No. 15,000? 10,000? No, such amounts do not interest me at all. Can't it be less than 5,000? Here's what I could think of to shoot in. Then it's up to you. Think what can be earned from a revue. Afterwards we go on tour. And then we can film it. And radio, television and... - Is that your joke? - Are you not satisfied? - Yes... 100,000! - Is there something wrong with it? - No, of course not. What conditions do you set? Only one: Mai Granner must not be told anything. - Is that a deal? - Of course. Then I will find my place, so I can take it all with me. 100,000! 100,000! Here you go! Here you go! And then let's get started. - I deliver the costumes. - I'll let my people know. 100,000! 100,000! 100,000! Here you go, girls. On with the cloths. Has Santa been here? The shipowner has given the director a check for DKK 100,000. Mrs. Brydeblom said so. It's terrible. I have to find out what happened. Here you go. then we go around a shipowner's check then we go around a shipowner's check of 100,000 then we go around a shipowner's check then we go around a shipowner's check of 100,000 - What happened? - It is a secret. It was the shipowner's condition for issuing the cheque. What? Shut up, Block. - Do you mean the man from last night? - Yes, of course. Then the check is fake. It was not shipowner Thorbjoern. - Nonsense. - I don't know the shipowner at all. They even pressured me to arrange a meeting with the ship owner. What was I supposed to do? I don't know Thorbjoern. - Who was him yesterday? - An acquaintance of mine. - What's his name? - I won't say that. It's terrible. At least the premiere is saved. Not a word to anyone. Get down on stage. Now we had just as much fun. What do we do? Get that man arrested or I'll be hanged for check forgery. 14-48. Farewell, 100,000. The next number is Mai Granner's anthem. Here you go, Chapelmeister. here in the street where I live you become beautiful when you grow up and famous and successful I'm looking forward to it all of us from Parma street come in the fine magazines with small bikinis on there you can see us standing like this and like that the men's eyes become so happy when they see us standing and bathing they turn the girls in the photographs this way and that other girls have to toil all day long behind a counter while they think we are neither bird nor fish they wish they had too what we have in Parma street but they must be lost because they were not created like that when I become Miss Universe I fly only wearing nertz over to Los Angelos and it stands Warner Bros. and shouts there's one from Parma street It's probably a smart crust then they engage me then they photograph me like this and like that I get wine and chocolate from the French Embassy and Marlon Brando says come on and kiss me there so and so I have to try everything and then the dream is over then I will be sent home as a worthless test back home and sell magazines where it says Parma street and the competitions and all the chances for the film models and the aerial castles and what else you get from yellow and golden sun when you are a little Parma violet It's terrible. The police are here to pick up Erik. Warn him. Mai, back in. He doesn't understand it. Down and change costume. The naughty bastard is in there. No, let me get him out. It's the criminal police. We have to carry out an investigation regarding a check, - - They should have been issued in someone else's name. - Do you want to come along? - No, don't talk about. Then I miss the show. - What is your name? - Erik Thorbjoern. - Can you identify yourself? - Do you want to smoke? - Would you please identify yourself? - All right. Is the driving license good enough? Can I see? There is no doubt. It is shipowner Erik Thorbjoern. Sorry for the inconvenience. Good evening, dear ship owner. And a very happy welcome. Then everything is fine, right? Also the check. The check! Sorry I... Block! Well done! Congratulations. It was a success. People were crazy. What was it that I wanted to…? Yes, the flowers. Well, are they there? Here you go. - Flowers for the star. - I am happy that it is going so well. - What has happened to Erik? - With Erik? May, congratulations. What a success. Isn't that what I've always said? Talent. Block. - Have you emptied the trash? - Yes. - Where? - Down by the boiler. - The check was in it, after all. - Yes, but it was fake. No, the police have just confirmed that he is the real Thorbjoern. Come. That cannot be true. - Here's the card. - Thanks. - Should I put the flowers in water? - Yes, please. In the black creek lake. Well then show me. - Where is it? - There. Find it. - There. - No. Now let me explain… No. You have made me a laughing stock with all your lies. If I just had to... I'm tired of your Palmer stories. What about your stories about the pyramids? You've been laughing at me the whole time. - May I enter? - No. Think I could be so naive. Turn around. It is probably you who started the rumours. - Do you know what? - Turn around. You are wonderful. I'm not wonderful at all. It has happened to both of us. - You are no gentleman. - Well, darling... No. The two of us have seen each other for the last time. I forgot my hat. There it is. There it is. now we have found the shipowner's check Up with the stage elevator. Dance, dammit. Success is at home. - Congratulations, Mai. - Erik has gone. - He's coming again. - No, and it's my own fault. I kicked him out and now I never see him again. What nonsense. Go downstairs and take off your make-up and then we're going out to celebrate. I'm not going to celebrate anything. If only I knew where he was. - Good night, Mai. And thanks for the flowers. - Good night. Good night, Grethe. - Are you sure you don't want to come? - Yes, I'd rather go home. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Good night. I'm very sorry, but I didn't see the puddle. But I will of course pay for the cleaning of your clothes. May I be allowed to drive you home? --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
