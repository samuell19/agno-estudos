Colonel Armstrong, M.G. Colonel, you're scheduled to fly out to Seoul at 1800 hours. You can rest in the lounge until that time, right over here through the door. - Roger. - Saville. Uh, Major, you're billeted tonight in B.O.Q 10. We'll fly out to Seoul tomorrow morning at 1000 hours. From there, you'll go by bus to the 54th Group at K-13. Thank you, sir. Martini, please. Very dry. Uh, pardon me, Major, but, uh, aren't you Cleve Saville? - Yes, I am. - I'm Gifford, the club officer. - You wouldn't remember me, I suppose. - I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. I was a second lieutenant with your old wing in London. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. What's your assignment in Korea? - 54th Fighter Group. - 54th. They're the rough ones. - I guess you'd like to be flying with them, wouldn't you? - I am. - Oh, I-I just thought that- - Oh, desk job? - Oh, not yet, I'm glad to say. - Oh, by the way... there's a 54th pilot in here for a weekend. Yeah, there he is. Uh, Lieutenant Abbott? Uh, Lieutenant? Hi, Lieutenant. Uh, this officer's assigned to your group. - This is Major Saville. - Carl Abbott. Hello, Major. - How do you do? - Well, it was nice to have seen you, Major. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Do you want a drink? - Just got one. Kevin, give me a double bourbon, will ya? And fill the major's up when he's through. Oh, man! I got a sinus. It's chewing me up. You ever have a sinus? They're murder. - Wait a minute. You're Cleve Saville. - That's what the man said. Well, it's just the sinus. I didn't connect. Sure, we've been expecting you. Some of the guys are already trying to shuffle the cards to get in your command. - Well, it may be a different war- - It's a lousy war. I was just going to say it may be a different war, but nothing else has changed. You still find everything out for yourself. What command? Squadron. Colonel Imil passed the word. - Imil? - Yeah, Dutch Imil. He- Oh! Man, this sinus. I gotta have another drink. Kevin, put one on the fire, will ya? He's our group commander. He flew with you, he said. Oh, sure, I remember Imil. We were in the same flight for a time in London. Yeah, he goes way back too. The Golden Boy of'44. The first of the jet pilots. A killer. A hunter. He eats two steaks at a sitting. The world is too small for him. The only thing a fighter pilot needs is confidence... and he's got enough for all of us. - When do you report? - I fly out to Seoul at 1000 tomorrow. That's my flight. Do you want to have dinner with me tonight? I've, uh, got to meet a gal at the Ichi-Ban Restaurant. Oh, no, not if you have a date. Major, I want you to come, okay? All right. Thanks. We'll have just one more, and then we'll go. Kevin, you're neglecting me. - Tell the driver I'll be right back, will you? Do you have a table for a Lieutenant Abbott? Yes, sir. There is someone waiting for him. No, thank you. I'm not staying. - He'll take you, sir. - Thank you. You, uh, speak English? Fairly well, I think. Somehow in a place like this, I expected you to beJapanese. Thank you for the interest, but I'm waiting for someone. Yes, I know. Lieutenant Abbott. - Oh? - I came to tell you he won't be here. It isn't like Lieutenant Abbott to send a substitute. Well, I'm not, but neither is it a bad idea. Where is Lieutenant Abbott? As a matter of fact, he's outside in a cab. I'll go with you. Allow me. Thank you. Carl? - Carl! - Don't waste your time. If it wasn't the doubles at the club, it was the triples on the way over here. - Four stops. - Why did you let him do it? Would you mind flashing that on the board again, please? I'm sorry. I'll be glad to drop you off where you wanna go before taking him back to the field. I wouldn't like anyone to see him this way. Oh, lady, look. In a barracks on a weekend... there's nothing odd about a man being poured into bed. I know, but I want to take him with me. Will you help me? Okay. Where are we going? Oh. Oh, my name's Saville. Cleve Saville. - Do you fly with Carl? - No, not yet. I'm just in from the States. But I'm assigned to his group. Do you know when he's scheduled to return to Korea? 10:00 tomorrow morning. Same flight as mine. It's very kind of you to help me. I'm a kindly soul. There on the sofa will do. Does the guy always knock himself out? Not like this. In the beginning, he almost never drank. - He's scared. - How do you know that? I've seen a lot of combat pilots. Too much booze is one sign. And headaches, he's got them. He doesn't think he's a very good flyer... because he hasn't gotten any enemy planes. He said he had over 30 missions. He can't be too bad or he'd be dead. - He thinks he's just lucky. - Well, maybe he is. A man can't hit it that hard and fight jets. Not for long. I would like to help him, but I don't know how. Fighter pilots don't wanna be helped. They're stubborn. You don't tinker with a man's fear. He does that for himself. Well, is there anything else I can do? If not, I'll, uh- Would you like some coffee? There, it's hot. Hot coffee, huh? You really were expecting the guy, weren't you? Of course. - Nice place. - Thank you. - Have you been in Japan long? - A few months. - Did you tell me your name? - Christina. I'm usually called Chris. - More coffee, Major? - No, thank you. I think if Carl could feel the war was more important... that what he is doing has a bigger meaning... I don't think he'd be like this. The war has a bigger meaning. The only trouble is it came along too soon after the real big one. It's hard to sell anybody on it. You are not sold on it? I'm regular air force. I don't have to be sold. No, I suppose not. A professional doesn't ask questions. We're not paid to ask questions. But we're not blind sheep either. We can get out, or we can wangle any sort of duty we like. I'm supposed to be a little overage for combat, but I managed to get here. - You wanted combat? - Sure. Why? Do you like the war? It's the only war I've got. I see. No, I doubt that you do see. Why? I've seen men go into Korea from World War II... trying to recapture a feeling of importance the other war gave them. Isn't that it? Oh, I know the kind of men you're talking about. No, it isn't like that with me. The war permits me to do the one thing I can do better than anything else- fight planes. - What about you? - What do you mean? Well, I bring a drunk home for a mysterious girl- a very pretty girl. I willingly discuss my private business for her curiosity... and all I get in return is a cup of coffee. But I thought you knew. I mean, when you came into the caf�, I thought you knew. I'm sorry, Major. I'm Lieutenant Abbott's wife. But he said he was gonna meet- No, I didn't know. I- I guess I've been pretty stupid. I only hope I haven't also been rude, Mrs. Abbott. No, you haven't. Well, in any case... thanks for the coffee. - Will he stay sober tomorrow? - Who's staying sober? Oh, who are you? Right now, I'm a man with egg on his face. It's Major Saville, Carl. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, Major, uh- Oh, sure. Well, what happened? I haven't been in any trouble, have I? No, no, no trouble, Lieutenant. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow on the plane, sir. Sure. Tomorrow. - Good night, Mrs. Abbott. - Good night, Major. And thanks again. - Carl, I- - Don't! I don't know. I'm sorry, honey. I got with a bunch of guys. You know how it is. I ran into Major, uh- What's his name? - Saville. - Oh, yeah, that's right, Saville. Oh, he's a big man. He and Imil are old buddies. Killers. Well, what do you know? Saville. You mean the major with all the confetti? Yeah, that's The Cleaver. Come on. - Hello, Cleaver. - Colonel Imil. - It's still Dutch. - Thanks, Dutch. Cleaver, this is Monty Moncavage. Maybe you've heard of him. He's got a large reputation- 11 MiGs. Yeah, it's a well-known name. Glad to know you, Colonel Moncavage. - Pleasure, Major. - Hey, knock it off. - Knock it off. - All right, knock it. This is Cleaver Saville. We were flying together when all a pilot had for breakfast... was a cigarette and a hangover. He's a big hunter. He's the "Ice Man." Get to know him. He's worth the trouble. But don't fly with him unless you want action. Come on over to the office, Cleaver. You're gonna like it here, Major. It's only 24 miles to the shower. Well, this is my home away from home. We've seen worse. Judas, this junk is heavy. - You really need that? - Just a little flash. Makes me look younger. I gotta keep up with these jet jockeys. Before God, there's a lot of good men going down in this stinkin' war. Anybody tell you it's a stinkin' war? Nobody but everybody. No guts. It's a war you can't feel. There's nothing simple about it like we had in the last one. Except dying. That's always simple. Sometimes I forget what this one's all about. - More? - No, no, not for me. Thanks. They tell you back in the States how crummy these Chinese MiG pilots are? Oh, yeah. We got statistics. They lose 13 to our one. Sure, 13 to one. But what they don't tell you is that when one of them's good, he's too good. CaseyJones, for instance. You heard of him, haven't you? - You're kiddin'. - I'm not kiddin'. A Chinese pilot named CaseyJones. He has a plane with the number 7-11 on the fuselage. Don't ask me why. Maybe he's a craps shooter. Look. The MiGs are based in Red China, here across the Yalu River. - Yeah. - We got standing orders never to cross the Yalu. But they're free to play it fast and loose on our side. - Still? - Still. They come off of their airfields strung out in a line. Bandit trains they call them. Now, if G.C.I. reports a bandit train taking off from Antung... with CaseyJones at the throttle... one of our air groups can count on losing two pilots that day. I lost seven good men to that China boy. Seven good men and a couple of aces thrown in. Old Case hasn't been around lately, but he'll be back. We can count on it. So never underestimate the MiG pilot. You're liable to run into a live one. Well, you make it sound interesting. I thought it would be. Would you care to wring out an 86 in the morning? Well, sure, if you think it's necessary. Oh, not for me. But I guess you haven't been up in a couple of weeks. You don't have to walk lightly with me. If you wanna see what I can do with an 86, I'll be glad to show you. No offense. Routine. - Sure. - Glad to have you with us, Cleaver. Dutch, good night. - Major Saville? - I'm Saville. I'm supposed to fly pitch-out with you this morning. - I know. - My name's Corona. Like in cigar. - Glad to know you, Lieutenant. - Yes, sir. - Our call is Cobra, right? - Right. You'll fly that one over there, sir, 140. Well, should we get on with it? - You had much time in an F-86? - Oh, enough I think. You're gonna need it all this morning. I'm talkin' out of turn, but there'll be a surprise package waiting for you up there. Oh? What's that? Colonel Moncavage took off about five minutes ago. He'll bounce you for simulated combat. - Dutch's orders? - Who else? He gets his kicks with surprises. Thanks for telling me. I'm a friend of man. K-13, this is Cobra. Ready to roll with Two. All right. You're clear for take-off, Cobra. Glasses, Matt. This'll be a good show? That's what I'm gonna find out. Would have been great 10 years ago. - Ten years is a long way back. Where are they? - Right up there. Bogey at 5:00, Cobra. Moncavage is getting in position. Moving to 6:00: Watch yourself: I'll break left and take him off. He did it! He pulled a high-speed scissors and got on his tail. Get outta there, Saville. Get outta there! Saville, do you read me? Go on. Break loose. Break off!: Major Saville, this is Colonel Moncavage. Now break off! Sorry, Colonel. Didn't know it was you. Moving out. The Ice Man cometh. Aren't you a little too old to be playing tag with small boys? Maybe I'm a case of arrested development. Yeah. Well, if you polish the apple... I might give you a squadron after you finish indoctrination. All I need is four planes. All right, then Flight Command. How long do you think indoctrination will take for me, Dutch? - Pretty smart, you know. - Well, it's the usual three weeks. But we give a bonus for old age. Maybe just two weeks for you. How many hours did you say you had logged in an 86? - I said enough. - Yeah, I've always said enough's enough. When you pick your flight, would you mind having me around? That is, if you can stand me. I'm sort of obnoxious. That's all right. I got a pretty strong stomach. Dad, you sure made a monkey out of Colonel Monkey. Will you cash this, please? Thank you. - Hello, Major Saville. - Oh, hello, Mrs. Abb- Thank you. There. Now we'll start over again. - Hello, Major Saville. - How are you, Mrs. Abbott? - Chris. - Chris. Four dolls. You must have quite a brood of girls back home. No, I have a brother in Spokane who has quite a brood. - Next, please. - That's you, Major. Oh, uh, air express, please. You're back in Kyoto awfully soon. Hasn't it been only about 10 days? Well, several of us came in last night. We're picking up some planes to fly back to the field. I see. How's Carl? - Well, he's all right, I suppose. - $3:35, please. - Three dollars and, uh- - Thirty-five cents. 1,173 yen. Well, Carl's fine. Nothing to worry about. Thank you. It was nice seeing you again. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Chris. - Yes. Look, uh, I'm more or less at loose ends. If you have no other engagement, I'd like to have lunch with you. That's very kind of you, but I don't believe I can. - There are some other things I have to do. - What? Well- You're quite right. I haven't anything to do at all. Well, do you know someplace where we can go? Something interesting? The only place I've eaten is my hotel, and I can't recommend that. There is a place I like very much, uh, but it's some distance. Well, I have the time if you have. - We'd need a car. - Rent one right there. I better warn you, it will probably be pre-1941. That's all right. So am I. Carl's in Kyoto, isn't he? Well, since I've already stuck my foot in my mouth, yes. He's one of the pilots who came in with me. Don't feel badly. I would have known it sooner or later. I gather this is routine behavior for the lieutenant. You, uh, like being stepped on? I'm trying to understand it. Wouldn't it be easier just to go back to the States? That wouldn't be an answer to anything. Do you mind if we don't talk about it now? All right. I didn't mean to stay in the service after the war ended. I suppose it was just a line of least resistance. I took foreign duty, pilot instruction in France, Turkey, Greece. - Just marking time. - Until another war. Well, till another something. It just happened to be another war. Now, you mind talking about yourself? What would you like to know? Oh, just start somewhere and end somewhere. All right. I lived in Oslo, Norway. I was 16 when the war in Europe ended. I had no family left, but there was a little money. I went to Paris to study art. My paintings look like a bad cross between Rembrandt and Picasso. I went to New York to study art. My paintings improved somewhat. Now they only look like a bad cross between Grandma Moses and Salvador Dal�. I met Carl. He was very charming. We were married and lived happily ever after. - Did you? - For a while. Carl hadn't seen action in World War II. He'd only gotten his wings when it was over. When this war started, they called him back into the service... and I came toJapan to be close to him. When I met him here, I didn't know him and he didn't know me. Well, that happens to some men in a war. They look at death every day, and after a while, they just can't see anything else. That's the reason why I don't return to the States. Sometime, he might need me here. Sometime, when the war is over, if he lives, maybe we can start over again. When will you form your flight? As soon as I finish indoctrination, a few days. Will you be allowed to pick your fliers? Well, I'll have something to say about it. Choose Carl. He won't be any safer with me. It isn't that. He seems to think he's the only frightened man in the squadron. I think that is much the problem between us. He thinks I expect him to be a hero, a great ace. If you'd pick him for your flight... Cleve Saville's flight, it might give him confidence... bring him closer to what he thinks he should be. You don't have to say yes or no to me. Just think about it. He will give you his best, I know that. What are you thinking? I'm just being envious of your husband. It's late. All right. What now, Mrs. Abbott? Whatever, Major Saville. I deliberately invited that, didn't I? It seemed right. I thought so too. It has been an altogether lovely day. I'm very grateful. Do you want me to go now? Yes. I've taken enough advantage of you. Advantage? Just that. And if I don't go? I'm off balance. Don't press me too hard, please. - Good night, Chris. - Good night. Cleve? Forgive me. Forgive you? Mrs. Abbott, I'm in love with you. - Hello, Lieutenant. - Why, hello, Major. I think I can make it to the house by myself this time. Thanks just the same. I've just been out with your wife, Lieutenant. Oh? Well, it does her good to get out once in a while. Me? I'm busy at the office. - We take off at 6:00 in the morning. - Yes, sir. I know. I'll be there if I have to crawl. Ever see me crawl, Major? I crawl pretty fast. I'll bet you do. Surprise! You're not surprised. Did, uh, Killer Cleve let the cat out of the bag? Well, accidentally. He didn't know I hadn't seen you. Anyway, why should he lie for you? That's right. Nobody owes me anything. Very friendly of Saville to pay attention to my wife. We met in the express office. He asked me to have lunch with him. What do you think of him? Carl, do you have to drink right now? Oh, come on now. What do you think of him? What's the matter? You must have some idea. - Aren't you making it awful important? - Well, maybe it is. What do you think of him? Well, I-I think he's a very lonely man. Lonely? This guy? No, this guy doesn't need anybody. Do you know what Imil calls him? The Ice Man. He's like death- no feelings, no nerves, no fear. Why do you tell me this? I don't know. - Forget it. - Carl. Do you think I'm comparing you with Major Saville? Well, aren't you? I don't know. I might be, but- Sure. I couldn't blame you. I've tried not to get in the way. I've tried to understand. But you've got to let me mean something. I want to be your wife again... even if it's for only the few hours you can spare me. You've got a big problem, haven't you? No, it isn't a big problem, but it's our problem. Yeah, that's right. I guess you're right. Well, I'll think about it, Chris. I swear to God, I'll- I'll try to think about it. Hello, Major. You're in and off in a hurry. Well, I got a different kind of contract, Sarge. They're paying me by the hour. How do you like that? Steady as a rock. No nerves. Maybe they're numb. Maybe they're dead. - Evening, sir. - Hi, Corona. Abbott. Tell me, how does it happen that I'm to fly with such select company, Major? You and Corona. Colonel Imil made up the flight. - Will you join us, Major? - Thanks. Gently. Gently. Don't rock the boat. All those beer cans yours? Well, it wouldn't be cricket to stack up another man's beer cans. I've got integrity. I am the most accomplished beer can stacker... in this whole squadron. 'Course, I don't have any MiGs to show for my missions... but I can stack my beer can stack up against anybody else's beer can stack. You say Dutch made up the flight, eh, Major? That's right. I had a feeling my wife might have asked you to honor me with your command. - Why should she? - She's got my interests at heart. She was greatly impressed when a man said, "To keep, in sickness and in health... until death do us-" She fancies herself a camp woman. Following her man into battle... shining his boots, bandaging his wounds, taking- Look, Lieutenant, I'm not interested in what you think about your wife. Right now, I'm interested in what happens to me over the Yalu River... with some blurry-eyed pilot flying my wing. You wanna get yourself grounded, you just add one more can of beer to that stack. How do you know I don't want to get grounded? I don't know. But if you do, I'll be happy to oblige you... just by reporting your alcohol content to Imil. I guess I don't owe my wife a vote of thanks. - Good night, Major. - Good night, Lieutenant. I've met his wife a couple of times. She's all right in my book. I don't get him. There's only one thing I can say He's got guts. Every time he takes off on a mission, he's scared green... but he goes anyway. Well, that's what counts, when they go anyway. Nobody makes you fly. He could dog it. Nobody cares. Nobody cares but Abbott. - Hey, daddy-o, give me some cigars, will ya? - Yes, sir. What's your name? I've been buying cigars here for three weeks and you don't remember my name? - Oh, wow, Charlie. - So have me shot at sunrise. Pell. Pell. P-E-L-L. Pell. Eight cigars. What do you mean eight? Six. All right, six. Can't blame me for trying. - You're Major Saville, aren't you? - That's right. - I'm Ed Pell. - So, what about it? - I'm assigned to your flight, you know? - Oh. Meet Lieutenant Corona. - Same flight. - Hi. Glad to know you. When do we get a mission? We're scheduled for the morning mission. Briefing at 5:00. - Don't you ever read the schedule board? - Gimme a chance, will ya? I just got out of indoctrination. 5:00. That's all right with me, man. - George. - What? - George. - Tom and George. See, George means "okay," and Tom means "not okay." Right, pal? You got it, man. - You don't get around, do you? - I've been around once. Wasn't anything to see except some shavetails with big cigars stuck in their faces. You're- You're the heater from World War I, aren't you? Don't sell me short, Lieutenant. I got my wings in the Battle of Gettysburg. Hey, that's all right, man. That's real George. Would you like a cigar? - No, thanks. - How about you, Lieutenant Corona? How about that? You want a Corona, Corona? - Too much, huh? - Gonna be a long winter, Major. Not so good, huh? Tom. - Where you from, Lieutenant? - Peoria. - Peoria what? - Illinois. - What do you think what? - I didn't know. I was asking. Eh. I'm sorry. I'm all hung up. Everybody's giving me the business. The bartender, everybody. Listen, Major, let me ask you. Do I look like I got bugs on me? Why, you got an itch? Ask a silly question, you get a silly answer. - Sir. - Sir. Am I gonna fly in your wing, Major? - No, you're in Corona's wing. - Oh, yeah? I could have been in the infantry with a foxhole to hide in. Hey, wait till you see my stuff, Leader. I'm hot, man. I'm on fire. - You'll give me a shot at a MiG, won't ya? - Oh, you'll get a shot. You guys are all right, you know? No kidding. We'll cut 'em up, won't we? Well, thanks, Major. Good night. Hey, we'll jive at 5:00, huh? See ya. - Good night, Lieutenant. - Later. You're too wide, Cobra Four. Bring it in. Yes, sir, Major. That's your position. Now stay there. A wingman's job is to cover his leader. Don't forget it. Yes, sir, Major. Whatever you say, sir. Why can't the MiGs come down to us sometime? We always have to play ball in their park. If they have to bail out, they're among friends, but us- All right, cut the chatter, Cobra Two. This line's for official business. We're coming over enemy territory, Cobra Flight. Test your guns. Cobra Flight, fuel check. Cobra Two, 300 gallons. Cobra Three, 320. Cobra Four, 295. We'll make one more sweep down to the mouth of the river, and then go home. Four bogies at 3:00, Cobra Leader. You're sure? G.C.I. reports no bandit activity in this area. He's right, Cobra Lead. I got 'em too. Roger, Three. I've got 'em now. Four bandits on parallel course. Maintain present heading. Drop your tanks. What are we waiting for? They're just sitting there. Cobra Lead, I can't drop my tanks. Okay, Three, I'll decoy. Abbott, follow me down. They're going in, Cobra Three. What are we waiting for? Let's go, Pell. Get outta there, Cobra Four! I got one. I got one. Do you see him? Do you see him? Affirmative, Cobra Four. I see him. Where's Corona? Where's Number Three? Just hold still, baby. I'm hit! Cover me, somebody. The MiGs are crossing the river. Break off. Are you okay, Cobra Three? Did you get hurt? Not too bad, but I'm burned up... freezing to death and down to 150 gallons of fuel. Let's go home. Cobra Four? Cobra Four, where are you? 4:00 wide, Lead. What are you doing out there? Get back into formation. You won't forget my confirmation, will you, Cobra Leader? You'll get your mark. You'll get your MiG. Coo-coo, daddy-o. Coo-coo. I'm losing power, Leader. I must have taken one in the engine. Abbott, take the rover boy on your wing and see if you can persuade him to go home. All right, Cobra Four. Close it up and let's go home. My hydraulic pressure is fluctuating. My controls are getting stiff. Look me over. You got some bad holes behind your gear and also a few in your tail. We'll drop down to a lower altitude and head for home. Blow your canopy off and prepare to eject over the base. She won't blow. I'll have to fly her down. Somebody can chop me out with an ax. This is Cobra Leader. - Go ahead, Cobra Lead. - K-13, Cobra Three's coming in shot up... flight control trouble and a jammed canopy. We have a Mayday. Did you read me, K-13? We'll be ready for you, Cobra Lead. Bring it in on the alternate runway. Get those trucks moving! Tower, tell Dutch we have a Mayday on the alternate runway. - Who is it? - Corona. He's gonna try to wiggle it down. - What's his fuel? - We don't know. Tower, this is Cobra Lead. Do you have us in sight? Yeah, I've got 'em. We see ya, Cleaver. Send Corona down, you land on the main runway. You're by yourself, Cobra Three. - Aren't we all? Okay, Leader. - Good luck. You look about right, Corona. Your gear's down okay. Speed looks okay. Take it easy and don't blow it. Don't anybody get excited. I always walk away. Get your nose down, Corona. Ease it down! Ease it down! Drop the nose! Drop the nose! My controls are locked! All I wanna know is this: Where were you, Lieutenant Pell, when Corona needed cover? He was gunning through Major Saville's line of fire... chasing the same MiG the major had staked out. - I didn't see the major's plane. - Why'd you leave your element? - I asked Lieutenant Corona for permission. He said okay. - I didn't hear that. Look, Pops, you're trying to bug me, and I'm not gonna take it! - At ease, Lieutenant! I said at ease. - I didn't hear him say- - Cleaver, did you hear Pell ask permission? - No. That doesn't mean I didn't. There's a lot of chatter up there. You know that, Major. All right, that's all. You and Lieutenant Abbott can go. I'll discuss this with Major Saville. If there's gonna be any discussing about me, I wanna hear it. Are you too stupid to understand you've been dismissed? - Okay. Okay. Later. - What'd you say? Yes, sir. I've been dismissed. - What do you think about him? - Can't use him. Take a look at his record. Air-to-ground gunnery, first in his class. Air-to-air gunnery, first. Tactical combat, first. First. First. First. And on his first mission, he gets a MiG. - At the cost of one of ours. - That could have been a misunderstanding. Maybe Pell did ask permission. That's possible, isn't it? - He's a liar. - I can't ground a man on something we only think. That's your decision. I don't want him in my flight. Nobody else will want him either. There's another way to handle this. Make Pell your element leader. Then you got no worries. Somebody else can cover him. You mean, you want me to pat him on the back? Say, "You're a good boy. You killed your leader. I'll make you leader"? Nobody's patting him on the back. I got one thought. It's always the same Get MiGs. That's my job. This little stinker's a fireball. He can get MiGs. If he doesn't get himself killed first, he'll be an ace. I won't stand in his way if he keeps his nose halfway clean. Well, let somebody else wipe it for him. Not me. Not my flight. Yes, in your flight. I couldn't find a better place for him... if I looked for a thousand years. Most of these boys are putting their lives on the line... because it has to be done, even if they aren't sure why. But you, you're different. You like the risk. It's the way you get your kicks. When you put your life on the line, it's just to see if your number will come up. Let's not pretend you care about Corona's death. The death of another pilot never turned your head. You see, I remember you from the old days, Cleaver. You were just like this boy- way out, all by yourself. You're two of a kind, you and Pell. If anybody can handle him, you can. Make him your element leader. That's an order. That's all, isn't it? Yes, sir. Thanks for the review of my past history. Past history? Current events. Men like you don't get any better, Cleaver. They just get older. As you say, Colonel. Major? How about it? Did you sink me? - Nope. - Hey, thanks, man. You're all right. - I figured you'd square me out. - Oh, you did, huh? Yeah, sure. You know, I figured you for a guy who'd take care of his boys. - Oh, I am, I am. - Yeah, I know. Boy, how about that poor guy Corona? Tough, huh? How about that? How about that? - What did you do that for? - For that poor guy Corona. What do you want me to do, say I was lying about asking Corona for permission? That might do for a starter. Okay. Okay, I'm lying. Corona burned on account of me. Now you tell me something, will ya? How's it gonna help for me to say it? Maybe you think it's gonna help Corona. No, but it helps me. You're my new element leader. I didn't wanna have any doubts about you, and now I haven't. I'm stuck with you, but you remember this: You fly with me and you're gonna fly right... unless you want a stitch of hot lead sewed up the back of your head. And I sew a pretty neat stitch. You dig, daddy? George? Yes, sir. Major? You've got nothing to worry about. I'll buy that when I see the goods. You know, you're right. That does look like a couple of other painters. It's all right for me to say that, but not for you. You're not answering your phone today, huh? I saw in the paper you were here. I didn't think it would be wise to see you. Well, you could've told me that on the telephone. I wouldn't have come. Perhaps that's why I didn't answer it. You're a neat package, Mrs. Abbott. Thank you, Major Saville. - Is Carl all right? - Well, he's not in Kyoto, if that's what you mean. No, but I haven't heard from him. He's my, uh, wingman. And for whatever that's worth to him. That was very nice of you. He wasn't pleased? He suspected you had something to do with it. Oh. I don't seem ever to do the right thing anymore. Maybe you ask too much of yourself. Look, I've got that same old jalopy parked outside. Shall we, uh, use it? Uh, this folder, it's, uh- It's a "what to see" folder, you know, put out by the air force. Says they've got a lake near here... with, uh, scenery around it, boats, you know, things like that. I thought you might like that. You wanna look at it? No, it isn't necessary. I'll go with you. Give me a minute to dress. - Am I being foolish? - No. There you are. They frighten away the bad spirits and please the good ones. In the East, they have a saying for everything. "In my house, when the wind sings, love dwells." This should have happened before I knew Carl. Now it's out of time, out of place. The time's always now. The place is always here. But not like this. Not like this. Is there any other way? I don't know. Would you give him up? - No. - But you said yourself your life was running out to nowhere. So is mine- to nowhere, to nothing. I can't desert Carl. Well, then what's left for us, except- All right. All right, Cleve. If it will mean anything to you at all- No, you're right. It is out of time, out of place. Cleve? Will you- You know, a woman is a strange and wonderful thing. I'll give you odds that you were gonna ask me to look after Carl. I'll look after him, Chris. I'll look after him. Good night. Well, hail to the ace of aces, the Achilles without a heel. How are ya? I- I used your absence to good advantage. I haven't had a drink of water in three days, and I never felt better. Good. Did you hear about the return of CaseyJones... starring Lieutenant Colonel Moncavage and, uh, six assorted Orientals? Yeah, I heard about the fight. How do you know it was CaseyJones? Well, he had the same 7-11 painted on his fuselage. He took Monkey out with one pass. Nothing to it. He just got inside and exploded him, like that. His wingman killed Johnson, and the rest of our birds came home... on a wing and a curse. - Cleaver? - Hmm? Would you like to do a favor for an old wing buddy? Maybe. What is it? If we run into CaseyJones, would you let me try him on for size? You and Pell have got enough, haven't you? That has nothing to do with it. You don't think I'm good enough. Is that it? No, I don't think you're good enough. So don't you get any ideas. You just stay right on my wing. Thanks, pal. I love you dearly. - See my wife? - Yeah. She looked you up, I guess? No, it was the other way around. Oh. That's a nice gesture. - Thanks. - Think nothing of it. - Cleaver? - Yeah? You wanna compare notes? So, the Ice Man has got a melted spot, huh? But aren't we a bit mixed up? Wife's lover slugs husband? Ought to be the other way around, shouldn't it? Wouldn't you be worried with me flying on your wing? I mean, all I've gotta do is, uh, drop back... move the stick a little and press the trigger. That's right. That's all you've got to do. Well, don't lose any sleep over it. I have another idea. Make you a deal, Cleaver. I get a crack at CaseyJones if we run into him... you get my wife. Even Steven, up and even. Well, what do you say, old Cleaver? - Excuse me, Major. - Yes, what is it, Corporal? Colonel Imil wants all flight commanders in his office at 21:00. Thank you. Well, Cleaver? Abbott, what's it like in that private little hell you've got for yourself? Exclusive. Ain't nobody in here... but us little old chickens. Here, I'll show you what I mean. The Reds have cut through this bulge and have severed this railhead. We've got 18,000 men in this pocket- First Marines, Black Watch, the Turks and the Greeks. They're gonna hold the pocket. Now, somewhere around 0300 hours... a flock of C-119s are leaving from Brady... to parachute supplies and reinforcements into the pocket. We'll put all operational planes into the air... give 'em the biggest umbrella we can. The MiGs are gonna be up there like a swarm of bees looking for sugar. It's no accident that CaseyJones has shown up again. They've probably got all their best pilots leading the intercept. We stop 'em. That's all. It's simple. You'll get your time over target in briefing. Good night. Viper and Rattlesnake, break off, orbit Chinnampo area. Cobra Flight, break off, "S" the Sinanju River. Roger, Python. Keep it close, Four: I've developed a rough engine, Leader. - We won't risk it, Jackson. Break off and go home. - Roger, Leader. Good hunting. Fly spare, Pell. Don't get into trouble. We can't cover you. Roger, Leader. I'm a cautious kid. You know that, man. Cleaver, did we make a deal? No chatter, Two. Maintain radio silence. This is the day, Cleaver. I got a feeling. Knock it off. Cobra, I have a flash at 1:00 low. I've got them. Hello, Python, this is Cobra. - Go ahead, Cobra. - Flock of bogeys at 20,000... coming into target area, approximate heading 1-4-0. Okay, Cobra. See what you can cut out of them. We'll be waitin' for the rest. Roger, Python. Cobra Flight, drop tanks. Cobra Two! Come in, Two! Where are you, Abbott? He was hit, but he got out all right. Cleaver, above you! It's the craps shooter! Python, this is Cobra. - I read you, Cobra. Go ahead. - Do you need us? I've had a turkey shoot here, Cleaver. What's left of the MiGs have turned tail for home. The drop is underway. - Pell, can you give me a fix on where Abbott ejected? - To the north, I think. Let's take a look. Swing around to the left. Hey, leader, fuel's running a little short. I'm down to 140 gallons. I've got 170. I'll stay with it for a little while. You break off and go home, Pell. Well, even if you find the guy, Rescue can't send a chopper in this far. - Are you reading me, Pell? - Yes, sir, I'm reading you. - Then you heard me say break off and go home. - Breaking off. Easy, Carl. I've got you. I followed you, so court-martial me. Get out of that yellow gear. You make too good a target. He got it bad, huh? - Are you any good with that automatic? - I'm a killer, man. - I cut 'em up, you know. - All right. You go on ahead of us, that way to the south. - Why don't we rig up a stretcher? - Not now. We gotta get out of this area first. Come on. Let's go. - And who's next? - Uh, Mrs. Abbott. Send her in, please. You may come in now. This is Lieutenant Abbott's wife. Major Dark. Yes. Won't you sit down, Mrs. Abbott? Uh, cigarette? No, thank you. Major, I've known other wives... who've had to keep this appointment. I know why. Is Carl dead? He's missing, Mrs. Abbott. - How long has it been? - Well, this is the fifth day. He was seen to parachute into enemy territory. He's alive? Well, if he wasn't hit and if his fall was good, he may be all right. However, if he is, he's almost certainly a prisoner. I know that's not very comforting... the Red prison camps being what they are... but there is the chance that he's alive. Is there no way to find out? The, uh- The information we receive from the Reds... through neutral channels is seldom accurate. If his name isn't on the prisoner list... well, that doesn't mean that they don't have him. - I see. - Did you know Lieutenant Edward Pell or Major Saville? - The major was your husband's flight commander. - I know Major Saville. Well, they were making a search for your husband. Both of them are also missing. That's my fault. I don't think that's quite possible, Mrs. Abbott. I asked Major Saville to look after Carl. Oh, of course. But, you know... that's a phrase that we all use about looking after someone. I don't think it would be just a phrase to Major Saville. - Thank you, sir. - If we get any news... - I'll get in touch with you immediately. - Thank you. Mrs. Mason. This is Lieutenant Mason's wife. Major Dark. Won't you sit down, Mrs. Mason? Cigarette? - Take it. - Hey, man, we could start a war. - Keep a close watch. - Okay. Here, eat this. - Where's yours? - I've had mine. Eat it. They must make this stuff out of Stalin's socks. - Cleve? - Yeah? None of us are gonna get out of here unless- Unless what? Unless you and Pell put me out where they can find me... and you go on by yourselves. They don't take wounded prisoners. You'd get a gun butt right between the eyes. Go ahead, eat. - Yeah? - Let's get out of here... before they find those two Reds and start tracking us in the mud. You got it. All right, let's go. Set him right over here, Pell. Forward a little bit. - How do you think he is? - I don't know. Look, we're not gonna move out of here for a while. I'll stand the first watch. Why don't you sack out for a few hours? George. Do you have any of those Chinese butts left? Where are we? Imjin Baptist mission. We're close to the Imjin River. Well, that means- that means we've got a long way to go yet. Not as long as it was. I'm not going to make it. You've stopped bleeding. You'll make it. The crows could be pecking at me in that tree right now. You could be in Kyoto... and she'd be free. Why'd you do it, Cleaver? "I could not love thee, dear... "so much... loved I not honor more." Is that it, Cleaver? You're quite a character under that tough hide. Cleaver? The pure in heart. Who would ever guess it? You don't belong in this stinking world. Bandage. Have you got a bandage? - What's up? What's up? - They're friends. We don't know what you're saying, but don't stop talking. It sounds great. - I think he's trying to tell us they're Christians. - Yeah, yeah. A Bible. How about that? We understand. We understand. - What's happening? - Sounds like we'd better get out of here. Let's go! Over here. Look, if you wanna do anything about it, we'll do it my way. This way. Pell! Dig this crazy potato masher. Now! - Where'd you take it? - Arm. - All right, let's go. - Easy. Easy. How about that, huh? How about that? You ready, kid? Do you think you could pull this thing by yourself? - Yeah. - I'll go on ahead. You know, Pell... you wouldn't be a bad sort of a joe if you'd just get a shave once in a while. Mother of Athens, you're Greeks! - Where do you think you're goin', Joe? - Right here, Sergeant. - Right here. - The boy in the cart's alive? Yeah, he's alive. You got a cigarette? That boy sick too? No, he just fell asleep. Yes, Mrs. Abbott. Will you please follow me? You may have 10 minutes with him. You must not encourage him to talk very much. Lieutenant Abbott? Your wife is here, Lieutenant. - Hello, honey. - Hello, Carl. - I'll be back when your time is up, Mrs. Abbott. - Thank you. Sit down, honey. No, not there. I'm-I'm being taken to San Francisco next week. - I know. They told me. - What will you do? - Don't try to talk, Carl. - Come on, Chris. What will you do? Chris, I've been in a dark place. Lying here, I- I've come out into the daylight again. What are you trying to say, Carl? I'm trying to say that... I remember how it was with us... before the war. I- I want it to be that way again. I've waited until it was too late to say that, haven't I? Got a match? Well, you cuttin' 'em up again, Pell? Yeah, man, I got another one. That's 10 for me. - When are you comin' back? - I may never come back. I'm in a weakened condition. I might even arrange to die. Didn't I tell you he was the fang? The old skipper is the fang, all right. How do you talk to this boy without an interpreter? Smoke signals help. All right, what's "the fang"? Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot. You- - You don't get around much, do you? - Don't get around. - Knock it off, will ya? - Oh, you're gettin' a D.S.C. for Casey Jones... if you don't mind adding it to your collection. - It's gonna make me top heavy. - Don't take it so hard. Somebody's gotta be a hero. Are you gonna include me in your new flight when you make it up, Skipper? - Make up a flight of your own. You've earned it. - Oh, no. Not me. I'm scared. I want to be in a flight where nothin' ever happens. You know, real safe. You know what I mean? Like-Like with him. - Suit yourself. - How about it, Skipper? One thing, stop calling me Skipper. You read that in a book. Anything you say, daddy-o. - Blow. - Blow? George! Later. Hey, uh, Cleaver, I have to ask you a question. Now, you understand I have to ask this. What happened up there? - Didn't Pell tell you? - Yeah, he said you were both shot down by ground fire. - Pell was, I wasn't. - Pell was gilding the lily, huh? Well, that's all right. Anybody can run out of gas. I didn't run out of gas. You know, standing orders are to get yourself and your plane back if it's operational. A man could get himself court-martialed if he disobeys that order. I could have made it back to the field. I said I had to ask you the question. I didn't say you had to tell the truth. I don't want any favors, Dutch. I, uh, don't figure I've got any coming. You know... you think you've got a man dead to rights, then he throws you a curve. You, for instance. I thought I had you all figured out and filed away. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe a man is never what you think he is. Maybe he isn't even what he thinks he is. Anyway, I'm accepting Pell's report. If you consider that a favor, you're stuck with it. Here's your matches. - Hello, Chris. - How are you, Cleve? I'm fine. We're, uh, unveiling the arm in about 10 days. - You saw Carl? - Just now. Then you know he's being sent back to the States. Yes, I know. Will you go back to Korea? Didn't I tell you? This is the only war I've got. When are you leaving? As soon- As soon as I can arrange passage, I suppose. - You suppose? - As soon as I can arrange passage. Well, there's the warning bell for the visitors. Those nurses will be beating the brush in a few minutes. - Cleve, if I- - Uh-uh. Whatever you're about to say, don't say it. Thanks. I was about to be very childish. Good-bye, Mrs. Abbott. Good-bye, Major Saville.
