Would you mind stepping out of the car? This is Hound Dog. Keep those screenings tight but polite. Watch the handbags for cameras. Roger that, Hound Dog. Professor Majdi. Jack Cochran, head of security, Ambler Electronics. Everything alright? - Yes, thank you. - Got people everywhere, shouldn't be any problems. - Thank you very much. Would you excuse me? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Merger is spelled T-A-K-E-O-V-E-R, and there's nothing wrong with that. Kinda the way life works, you know? SEC is coming on Monday to do the gee whiz, do we really have to audit. So by Wednesday, what? What, what financial improprieties? That's bullshit, cowardly bullshit. Look, you tell them that if they don't stop spreading lies that I am gonna switch from hard ball to wrecking ball. You got that? Well you can tell them that! - Oh, my hero. Don't shoot, I'm unarmed. - Yes, but still very dangerous in this dress. - Don't mind me, not that you would. Hey, don't you two know marriage is supposed to put a stop to that sort of thing? Perverts. Yes sir, go right up there and stop for security clearance. Come on, bring it up. Shepherd Two here, Hound Dog. We've got Headmaster inside the loop. Copy that, Two. Sitrep on Kingfisher. Hi, how are you? It is an honor to finally meet you, Professor. My wife and I are great admirers of your work. We love your poems. - I'm flattered, but I don't write poetry. I write novels. You have read my books. - I have not, but my wife tells me they are wonderful. - Aha, so she is the power behind the throne. The empress of Ambler Corporation. - Empress, I like that. - Oh, I'm sorry, I apologize. - Don't worry bout it. My husband takes his shoes very seriously. When he was a boy, he had to wear hand-me-downs from his older brother. - Yeah, he wore one size too small. It's no problem, Professor. Would you care for some more wine? Longbow here. Perimeter looks good, beach is clear. Today, we are honored by the presence of a man whose courage is exemplified just by his being here. But before our honored guest speaks, we must thank our hosts whose charity has made this event a reality. Chief executive of Ambler Electronics Corporation, Mr. Jonas Ambler and his wife, Joanna. - Hey, partner. I'm not going to this party. I just live on down the road. - My good friends, I am truly happy this evening to receive the ILA's most generous award. Yet, it's also a sad occasion, for the forces of primitive fanaticism have not yet calmed their souls. I ask you now, can we keep silent when all around us demand that we cry out? Do stand idly by while throughout the world Hatred and prejudice are not created. They are nurtured-- Keep your head down. Get us out of here! Get up, Joanna. Come on, come on! Joanna. Joanna. This is a special news report. World-renowned author Nasir Majdi was gunned down today in an apparent terrorist attack by a previously unknown extremist Islamic faction. 15 people were killed and at least two dozen severely wounded in the attack that took place at an awards ceremony-- - My wife, is she? Could you find out, is she okay? Sir, I'm sure everything's fine. Just try to relax. Breathe deeply into the mask and relax. Oh God. - It's just such a shock. I don't know, if it was me. I'm just, how long do you? Just a second. Jonas? Are you in much pain? - Joanna, how is she? Please. She made it, right? She made it. - I'm sorry, so sorry. - No, no. No. - Yes, yes I understand. Uh huh, I see. I'll talk to you later. - Mr. Ambler, this is Special Agent Ranklin. - Mr. Ambler, the senator wanted me to extend to you his deepest regrets. Majdi's killing rattled a lot of cages in Washington. And naturally, we're very sorry to hear about your loss, but the man that you're looking for is an international terrorist for hire, completely out of our jurisdiction. We can't just pick him up. - Define can't. Is this can't as in humanly impossible or can't as in we just don't care enough about individual human lives to exact retribution? - We are fully aware of the seriousness of this crime, but this particular guy is completely unapproachable. - If I've learned anything from business, it's that no one is completely unapproachable. Now you tell me where he is and who he is! - He's called Phoenix. He operates somewhere out of the Middle East. It's most likely that he was hired by an extremist faction to hit Majdi. Unfortunately, you and your wife were innocent bystanders. - I am not a bystander, Mr. Ranklin, I am a player. And no one who ever fucked with me got away with murder. Am I fucking clear? Please. Mr. Ambler. - Mr. Ambler, is there anything I can do? - No one can do what this Phoenix does for a living without making enemies. Somebody somewhere hates this guy, perhaps as much as I do. Let's find that man, shall we? As it says in the Bible, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. - Well, there is somebody in the community. Decorated for bravery, real professional. As good as Phoenix if not better. In the old days, they played the game against each other. Both the best in their field. Reds had Phoenix, we had Hawk. Now that the Cold War's over, everybody's freelance. - We gonna make a deal, huh? - Halfback is in the hole. - Spread 'em. Come on. Just a pen and a credit card. - Hello, bag man, you want a drink? - The girl first. - The girl, she's a pretty one, ain't she? Yeah, pretty girl. Oh, this is gonna hurt you more than me. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, medium rare or well done? I swear I'll burn her, I swear to you. Gimme that money or I'll burn her. Good boy. - Looks like a million. - One million? I meant two million. Now, bag man, you go back to Dad, and you tell him to send another million. Then I'll think about lettin' Little Miss Rich Bitch go. - Gentlemen, please be professional. Give me the girl. - Screw you. - Okay. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Get in, let's go. - 20 grand closer to retirement, yes. - Get this thing off of me. Goddamn motherfuckin' ass suckers. Son of a bitch cocksuckers. Untie my fuckin' hands. - Well, Daddy is sure gonna be glad to have her home. - Hey, Hawk, how's it goin', buddy? Shoes are a long story. - Captain May. Alan Bailey, chief financial officer, Ambler Electronics. - Nice meeting you. - I'll take you to Mr. Ambler. - Thank you for coming, Captain. You know, of course, Jack Cochran, my head of security and former NATO colleague of yours, I'm told. And my good friend, Alan Bailey. Alan. - Captain May, Karl, codename Hawk. Selected from the elite French commando Hubert to become captain in command of Saber, NATO's special operations team. 1984, Saber removes a Russian prototype tank from Kabul, Afghanistan, intact. 1986, Saber destroys the Cyclops computer network, Stasi headquarters, East Berlin. 1988, Saber extracts captured double agent Jupiter from Dzerzhinsky Square, Moscow, et cetera, et cetera. - Wow, very, very impressive. Very heroic. Your record is perfect, Captain, except for one stain. Beirut, 1989. Phoenix masterminded the attack on the NATO barracks. You were in charge of security. I understand you retired afterwards. I want this man Phoenix, Captain hawk. - I think you'll have to take a number, sir. - The number I'm offering is two million dollars. - Phoenix is way out in the ass-end of nowhere. No man's land, Kurdistan, surrounded by every ex-Spetsnaz and Warsaw Pact killer he can drum up. - There is one condition, however. I'll be going with you, and I will pull the trigger. - It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Ambler. Shall we say three million dollars? - It is not a matter of money, Mr. Ambler. I don't work this way. - You drive a hard bargain, Hawk. Four million. - I don't think you understand. I'm not a tour guide. - Captain Hawk, wait. I've been from one end of Washington to the other. I've tried going through channels, but you mention Phoenix and it's like saying Dracula. I won't be able to go on with my life if I don't do this. We're not talking business here, Captain. We're talking about my wife. She was the best thing in my life. She married me when I was poor, when I had nothing, so you name your price. Why not? I'm alright. - An amateur will get you killed, and dead people don't collect the money, Mr. Ambler. - My physical condition is temporary. I'm in training. - I'm not talking about your limp. I'm talking about your heart. You see, in my business emotion is a handicap. Emotion gets you killed. Consider this a free consultation, Mr. Ambler. - What, are you afraid of Phoenix, Captain Hawk? Huh, are you? Are you a coward? - The numbers match, it's the chip. I'm getting way too old for this stuff. It is definitely time to retire. Yes, step right over there. Where do I go with these? Next person. I want you to get some rest. - What do I keep telling you? Don't worry about me, Mom. Let's see, you got about 10 minutes to get to your flight. You get on home, now, you hop to it. - Do you have anything to declare, sir? - Yes, recovered good. This is the documentation. Get some rest, Mac. Open the case, please. - Whoa, wait a minute pal. - Excuse me, sir. - Hey, hey, look. - Call security. Code seven, customs gate 17. Code seven, customs gate 17. - Sir, thank you. Come this way with us, sir. They're takin' him away. - They found some drugs. - Drugs in his bag. - I just don't get it. A kilo of pure China White. Why would the Japs do it? They got their money. - The Yakuza, they don't work that way, they don't. - So what, the buyers? That doesn't many any sense either. Nobody would ever do a job for him again, never. You should've seen the arraignment. Judge wanted to burn me at the stake. Half a million bucks for a bond. - We'll get it. - None of us have access to that kind of bread. They're gonna give me 10 years. I won't live to see half of that. We need a guy who can pull some strings. - Captain hawk, how nice of you to come by. I was sorry to hear about your troubles. I understand that you and mister-- - McClean. - McClean are very close. That you've been in business together for many years. I think it's good that partners take care of each other through thick and thin. - Can you get him out? - Must be devastating, the prospective loss of a loved one, but then again you're the guy with no emotions, right? So it may not be so terrible for you. As you have guessed, I do have some influence in Washington, but I was hoping you came here because you reconsidered my offer. - Possibly. - Possibly, well I could arrange for bail and have him released in my custody. Keep him nice and comfortable here until we all get back. - I never operate without McClean as my control, ever. - Please don't think me naive. I realize that once McClean is free you and he can disappear, but I am told that you are an honorable man, Captain. Do we have a deal? - Are you warm enough? - Yeah. - Hey guys, turn the heat up, will you? - Looks just like Beirut. Brings back bad memories, doesn't it? - Almost there, target's on the other side. - Mountain of the Sacrifice. - Yeah. In ancient times, the local people performed human sacrifices. Welcome to the wild east, gentlemen. This is an exact replica of Phoenix's business. We built the mockup through intelligence specs. One to one, as you requested. - Jonas, are you sure you want to go through with this? - Gentlemen, this is Santa Magdalena. Phoenix's main base of operations is represented here on the sand table. 150 clicks from our present location there across these mountains. Now Magdalena was built on the remains of an early sixth century Eastern Orthodox church which was, in turn, built over a pagan temple, the foundations of which go back to earliest recorded history. Inside, up to 60 men. Poles, Hungarians, Russians, all ex-Spetsnaz special forces. Latest Soviet gear. The eastern plateau has a perimeter track which is motor patrolled by an army of an Afghan warlord. The only option is the northern lip, but you have to take out these positions before you drop in. Now-- - Excuse me. When you say drop in, what exactly does that mean? - We'll be parachuting in, Mr. Ambler. - Parachuting? No, oh no, no, no, no, no. - What is your problem, Mr. Ambler? - I get vertigo. Intense vertigo. Messy vertigo. Now listen, so what you do is pick up the hang glider, run up to the edge, and you dive. - I dive. Define dive. Watch. - Holy shit. - Go. - Heard that shit, Mister. I'll go when I'm good and ready. - Phoenix will die by old age by then. - Jump, now. This is amazing. - Whatever you do, do not look down. - We could always use him as a secret weapon. - We have to change tactic, this is not working. The end is fine. It's the beginning that's wrong. This is not a standard operation. We've got to choose-- Here let me show you something. - Hey, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Did you take your pill? - Yes, I took the pill. You're gettin' into trouble in that corridor down there. You're wasting seven or eight seconds down there. The end of this is fine. The timing is right, everybody is on a button. But the beginning, down the corridor, you're wastin' time. There's sever or eight seconds down there. There's nothing there, we know that from the ground work. Nothing but storage, skip it, rewrite the scenario. - Another run. - Listen, I want to run with you. - Not yet. - What do you mean not yet? It's my goddamn dime, and I want to run. - Not until you're ready. - Are you trying to make me look like a fool? - You are a fool. This is not Disneyland. - Yeah, well fuck you. I'm warning you, McClean. Your boy messes with me one more time, I'm gonna ship you right back to the big house. Now you look me right in the eyes. You tell me, you know I mean business. - Well, you did it to me once. I have no reason to believe you wouldn't do it again. - Hey, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean? Did you hear that? He thinks-- - Jonas, these guys are lowlife. What do you care what they think? They're just tying to intimidate you to scare you away. You're doing fine. - Goddamn son of a bitch! You moved that bottle there on purpose, you stinking mercenary. You think I don't know what's going on around here? You're trying to get me to back out, intimidate me so I'll call the whole thing off. Well I got news for you. I will not be intimidated, I will not be scared off. Now turn off the fuckin' light, and I'll do it again. Hey, this is not a joke! This is not a whim! That fucker killed my wife! You understand? My wife. - Okay, let's go. Go! - 40 clicks in six hours, double step. - 40 clicks in six hours, double step. - 40 clicks, six hour, double step. - 40 clicks, six hours, double step. What's a click? - A kilometer. - Oh right, I knew that. - I'd be very happy to call everything off, Mr. Ambler. Just say the word. - Nobody's calling anything off. - Well either you keep up or I call the chopper back in. - Hawk, why don't you just shut the fuck up and go do your job? Okay. - You want me to go help him with his gear? - No. I'm beat. Bet I fall asleep in five seconds. - Ambler, Ambler! - It's me. - Come on, get down, get down! - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, they've gone. Listen, I just wanna get something straight between us. - What, your conscience is troubling you, Mr. Ambler? - You think I planted those drugs on McClean, don't you? Don't you? Well, you're wrong. When I heard McClean had taken a fall, I realized you and I could help each other. Yeah, right, I took advantage of an opportunity, but I did not set him up. I did not do that. If I wanna fuck with you, I'll do it to your face. I won't go behind your back. Listen, I don't care if somebody hates my guts, but I insist on being hated for the right reason, not some bogus notion. - Ambler, get down! Good luck. Thanks. Get down! - Weapons down. Arms up. - What happened? Captain, what happened? They knew we were comin'. Somebody gave us up. - Ah, Captain May. No, no I think we've known each other long enough for me to call you what your friends call you. Hawk. I thought we'd meet some day, have a drink maybe, talk about the old days, yes? Beirut. Oh, is it painful? In my part of the world, infections can be very dangerous. - Murdering son of a bitch! - I remember you. How is your wife? I suppose you thought that attack was ideological. No, the author was just cover. Do you understand? You were the target. Not Majdi. You. I was contracted to kill you by your underlings and your chief security officer, Mr. Bailey and Mr. Cochran. The same men who called to alert me that you were coming here tonight. Mr. Cochran, time to wake up, sir. - Okay, listen up. This is not good, people, not good at all. By this time, they should've hit the extraction point and called for the bird. If they'd have pulled this off, we'd have had panic on Phoenix nets. Looks like we got a goddamn SNAFU, boys. - Someone translate for me, please. - Situation normal, all fucked up. - Think of this as a real life, how do you say? - Fun house. - Ah, fun house. - Son of a bitch, come back here! - Welcome to my playground. We have to find ways to amuse ourselves between, how do you say? - Gigs! - Gigs. - Yes, not bad, eh? The food, the food is not bad. The women, the women, yes. Women not bad, eh? Better than the outside world. Ah, the outside world, nothing to believe in. So shallow. Nothing to fight for, huh? So this is what I thought. Now that you are here, we can actually make it very interesting. Play for high stakes, life, death. You fight me. You win, you get to go free. You lose, eh. Knife! - I'd like to set you free, Hawk, but my accountant, he would be very disappointed. Have a good night sleep, eh? I won't execute you until morning. Take him back to his cell. Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Help! Hawk. Hawk, get me out of here! Hurry! Come back! Which way do we go? - I don't know. The door. It's locked. I got it, move. - Hurry up, come on. They're coming. - Get in there. Move! Move! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I need this. Here, come on, move on. We're trapped back here. Oh man, what are we gonna do, Captain? We are so fucked! The window. What? The window. What are you talking about? - Hold this. Get down! Jump! - How high is this? - Jump! - Where we going? Holy shit! Hawk, get this thing off the ground! Come on! Go, go, go, get us out of here, hurry! - Whoa, heads up, I got a bird in the air. Just east of the target. - What do you got? - I've got a scramble on the Phoenix nets. - And? - The Phoenix's second in command issuing orders to SAM batteries. Says his boss is down. Hawk and the American businessman have his chopper. - Yes! - We made it. Uh oh. - What, what is it? Oh God! Looks bad. Getting closer. We're gonna die! Oh no! Oh no, no! Hold on! - Mr. Cochran, the bird is down. - Oh God. - Come on, let's go. Hawk, let's go. Wake up, come on. We gotta get out of here. It's me, gotta get you out of here. We gotta get out of here. Come on, come on. Come on, let's go. Come on, keep going. Hurry up. Come on, let's go. - You're welcome. Get down! Come on. - No. - Move. - I gotta rest. Okay. Screw you, you son of a fuck. Ow, fuck, fuck. - Just got a contact from a mobile unit. Recon squad at the crash site. No bodies found. - Cut into their net. Tell Mr. Klinge that our dearly departed, Phoenix's employer, wants to speak to him. Sit down, McClean. Trust me. I planted those drugs in your suitcases, and I'll plant a bullet into your brain just as a follow up. - I don't get it. - You don't need to get it. - As a professional courtesy, Mr. Cochran. - Okay, Bailey here has been embezzling millions of dollars from corporate accounts. - Cochran! - I, of course, have been gettin' my share. When that Ambler insisted on going ahead with that stupid merger, he set off a standard SEC pre-transaction audit, which would've exposed us, so we had to get rid of him. - Shh! - But very, very subtly without any further investigation. An innocent bystander, victim of a terrorist attack. Happens every day. Hell, I even got myself shot up, made it look real. - Cochran, you're babbling! - Calm yourself, Bailey. Dead men can't jump. Klinge, Cochran here. - I am a little busy, Mr. Cochran. - Now you listen up, Major. I know you have enough good reasons to run those two down, but I'm uppin' the ante. You bring them both back to me in body bags, and I'll double your fees. - I will consider that a binding commitment, Mr. Cochran. - Good as gold. We get to that mountain, and we are halfway home. - Halfway? Jesus, I don't think I have any skin left on my feet. - Let's go. Move. - What? - Move. Stop saying what, move! Come on, move. Mister, move, run, run! Get his shoes. - You used me as bait, didn't you? - Yes. - Smart. - You drive. - What? You drive. - Hold on! - Hold on, what do you mean hold on? Hold on to what? - Desperado money. - Just in case, it's all yours if Ambler never makes it out. - God, oh God! We're alive. We made it. Oh God, we're alive. These boots are one size too small just like the old days, but I'm not complaining. Hurry, they'll be down here any second. - Two on the net, sir. - Gimme some good news, Major. - They made it to the mountain. - Look, I don't pay for shoddy work, Klinge. Now you gather up those satellite Afghan drug runners you're always bragging about and send 'em the fuck in there! - Oh yeah, I know what's going through your mind now, Mr. Cochran. Hawk's on his way back. My life expectancy is dropping with the trajectory of a thrown-- - Don't be messin' with my mind, Mac. I worked long and hard, and I deserve some kinda security in my old age. I've got kids that I haven't seen much growin' up. I got a sunset point comin', and I don't take care of myself, no one else will. - Take off your shoes. - Why? - Gimme your shoelaces. - Why? - Come on. Take off your shoes and backtrack, okay? Let's go. - Here they come. 20 yards. 15, I think. 10. Five. Okay. - Get the gun, get the gear. Come on, let's go, let's move. Let's move, come on. Come on, let's go, come on. - A Walkman, maybe with mustard. Chewing gum, want some? What do we do now? - No place to go, they're all over. It's the adrenaline rush that gives you the shakes after a job. - Thanks. For what? - For calling yellow-bellied fear an adrenaline rush. How many hours till dawn? - About three. - They're gonna try to kill us at first light, right? - Probably. - Then maybe we should try crawling out. - We need a hole in their defenses. I could punch a hole if I had a silencer. - What about a noisemaker? - What? - I hope this works. I did get my start as a TV repairman, you know. Okay, with this kind of a boost, it's only gonna last a few seconds. Ready? Okay. One. Two. Three. Get the radio. I think Klinge's dead, Mr. Cochran. The Russian's say they can't find his field radio either. Now we definitely TAFU situation here. Cochran, speak English. Things are really fucked up! Klinge's dead, and our favorite sons have gotten through his line, and Klinge's field radio is missing, which means they can home in on our signal. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Bring his doomed ass over here. Looks like Phoenix's men are seeking other career opportunities, which means for the first time in three days I can pee. Saber this is Uncle Mac, do you read? Over. - Come in, Uncle. - Startin' to worry about you, Hawk. Here's the deal. We have McClean, and you have Ambler. If Ambler comes out alive, McClean is buzzard breakfast. Is that clear enough? What do you expect me to do, Cochran? - You knife him. Put a bullet through him. Just bring me proof. A finger will do. Bring me the third finger on his left hand. Make sure his wedding band is on it. You have four hours, copy that? - Loud and clear. - Ah, thank God for small favors. That was good. I think it's time we pay my trusted friends a visit, right? - Oh my God. I don't believe it. - I'm really impressed, McClean. He's actually killed Ambler to save your sorry ass. - It's all over, we're in the clear. Fuck you, Jonas Ambler. Fucking bastard. I ran his company, I did all the work, and what did I get in return? Virtually nothing, a salary. He should have made me a full partner years ago. Instead the fucker hoarded it all for himself. He had the perfect house, he had the beautiful wife, he had the Forbes cover spread. Everybody thought he was this genius deal maker. Well guess who made the better deal? - So, Hawk, you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who's got no options. - Cochran. - And you probably realize you're not gettin' out of here. You put your weapon down real slow. Toss the evidence over here. - Is it there? Finish it, Cochran. - See you in hell, muchacho. - I wouldn't do that, Mr. Cochran. I may not be the greatest shot, but this is a very powerful rifle, a 7.62 millimeter. I might miss your heart, but I'll probably hit one of your two faces. - You heard the man, put your weapon down very slowly. - I can't do that. - Just do it now! - It ain't gonna happen. You boys don't want me. You want the accountant. I'm just a gun on a payroll, just like you. Go ahead, take him. This shouldn't be personal. This shouldn't be emotional. - Cochran, you're out of your fucking mind. - Shut the fuck up! Don't do anything stupid. Let's take a walk, Alan. - No. - Define no. - Good, this is all making a lot of sense. Win, win, everybody wins. - Cover me. - Gotcha. - Come on, asshole. Come at me, you goddamn coward. - If you stopped to defend your wife, she'd be alive today. You ever think of that? - Shut up! - I know what you're doin'. You're just tryin' to slow me down so big brother can come here and help you out, you asswipe. Shit, I was guy who got your wife killed, and now you're waitin' for somebody else to help you do the job. - Sone of a bitch! Why? Please meet your party at the information counter on the lower level. - Hey Mac, listen if there's anything I can do. - Oh hey, I plan to bug you for stock tips for years to come. - You call me any time, for anything Mac. Thanks for everything. - Hey. - Well, what was that I saw? An emotion? Things are lookin' up.
