Josh, come down and eat. Fine. Yo. Eat up, buddy. - You do you're homework? - Yep. Of course he did. He always does. - Hey. Okay, keys. Keys. Where are my keys? - Seriously? - What? - You're ridiculous. - See -- yeah. I was testing you. - Hmm. - That was a test. - Hmm. - You failed. - Aw! And you -- thank you. Okay. I'm out. Knuckles. Pound it. Boom. Nice. Thank you. - 'Kay. - Love you guys. - Bye, Dad. - Come on. Hurry up. They're gonna be here soon. Hey. Hey. Hey, Daniel. Hey, Josh. Looks like you finally gave in. Yeah. Well, it keeps him quiet on the drive, at least. So are we still on for girls' night next week? Anything to get away from this little monster. Right? All right, hey. You guys be good at school. - We know. Love you, Mom. Bye! - All right, bye. Good luck with that. All right. Bye. I saw some of you guys were answering the questions with numbers, some had happy faces. I like all the answers, but how many muffins are we gonna eat? Okay, go ahead. Hey. Sorry. Shh. Hear that? Hold on. What? Here, uh, you can move your guy. Here. I'll let you go first. Okay. Uh, then we set them up in a line. And you're like, four -- four, five, or six each. Yeah, sure, but how many do you want to put on first? Six? Yeah, sure. Here. I'll have six, too. I think Josh has an imaginary friend. Ah, that's cute. I guess. Okay, time for your ni-nights. Good night, Mom. Good night, Dad. And goodnight, Matchie. Mm. Anybody else? Goodnight, Chewie! Mm-hmm. Okay, give me a kiss. - Goodnight, Mom. - Love you. You want it open or shut? - Open. - Okay. Night. Bye, Mom! Bye, honey. - Good morning. - Seatbelts? - Yep. - Okay. Thank you. Shit. Hey, Mom. How you feeling? Where's your sister? Uh, yeah, she should be here soon. Can I get you anything? I saw your father. He looked just the same. He hadn't aged a day. I could smell his cologne. Ah. Is that for your new friend? I don't think we've formally met, Josh. What's your new friend's name? Are you gonna tell us? He doesn't want me to. - Oh. - Okay. Hmm. They want to know your name. Okay. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. "Z"? Yep. Nice to meet you, Z. He says, "Nice to meet you, too." Oh, wow. He's very polite. Mom, no! The floor's hot lava! Stop, stop, stop! The floor is hot lava. Only step on the rocks. Yeah, okay, good. Come on. Let's go. It's time for bed. No, no! You're melting! You're melting! Aaaaah! No! No! Come on. It's time to brush your teeth. Let's go. Come on, Z, let's go. Okay. Make one more move. Just come on. Oh! Oh. Whoa, whoa. This floor is hot. So, now -- ha! You're stuck, Z! Okay, Josh, come on now. Fine. Good night, Mom. Good night, Dad. Good night, Matchie. Good night, Chewie. Mm, sweetie, you sure you still want to say good night to him? Just because he died doesn't mean he can't hear me. Okay. All right. Love you.Love you, too. Wait. Close it. Are you sure? Yeah. Z likes it dark. So, what are we gonna do about this? About what? What do you think? What, his creepy imaginary friend? I don't know. He'll grow out of it, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Did Daniel say anything? That they weren't gonna come today? Josh, did Daniel say anything? All right, have a good day. Love you. Hello? This is. This is never an easy conversation to have. I just don't understand. Suspended indefinitely? Listen, Josh is one of my favorite students. Well, what did he do exactly? I don't even know where to start. Um, the language is unacceptable, and now he's started hitting his classmates. What? Hitting? This was all detailed in the red cards I sent home with him. W-What red cards? This is your husband's signature isn't it? Sorry, Beth. Until Josh can behave in a classroom setting, I -- I just don't see any other options. "Josh left class without permission and refused to come back when asked." "Josh was caught harassing other students, both verbally andphysically." "Josh has been using vulgar language repeatedly, was asked to stop but continued." Sh-- shall I keep going? Okay. I'm sorry. It's just, kids get into trouble sometimes. It's what they do. Well, our kid just got suspended, Kevin, so great job. That's good parenting. And he refuses to take responsibility for any of it. He blames all of it on his new best friend. Okay. So what do you want to do? Having an imaginary friend can come from several things -- boredom, loneliness, a need to establish boundaries, and sometimes means acting out. So, does he need to be on something? Beth. Jesus. Were not medicating our kid. No, I don't think that's necessary. A lot of children develop imaginary friends, and oftentimes it can be a positive experience. So, is there anything we can do to help him be less... you know, destructive? Well, you could try playing with him more at home. You could be there for him like his friend is, help him see that it's all right to be himself around real people. Okay. So, that's it? I think so. I think he's a perfectly normal 8-year-old boy. Okay. Nice to see you again, Beth, although I wish it was under better circumstances. - Oh. Yeah. - Josh, let's go. Come on, Z. Z? Yeah, that's what he calls it. Listen, thanks for everything.Uh, yeah. We'll follow up in a couple days. - Of course. - Okay. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Okay. Hey, Josh. You know, you really gotta go see Mom. She's -- she's looking rough. She keeps asking about you. I know. I know. It's just, I can't see her like that. It actually makes me feel sorry for her. I don't think that's possible. What has she been saying? She talks about Dad a lot. He's having fun. Wish I had a friend like that. Ah, just make one up. That's what he did. Hm. Kevin. Josh? Josh. Hi, Mommy. Z doesn't want crust on his sandwich. Okay, honey. Can you just give me that -- No! I have to finish. He's hungry. Okay, why don't you just give me the knife? Careful now. Good boy. I'll tell you what -- we will finish this in the morning. Okay? Right now, let's just go back to bed. - Thanks. Is this for me? Ah. So, what are you two getting up to today? - We're going to Play Zone! Hey, you show your mom a good time, little dude. And you, remember -- just be the friend he needs. All right, I gotta run. I love you guys. Knuckles. All right. Yeah! Yeah! Oh! I'm gonna get you! - Whoo! Ha, ha, ha! I won! You lo-o-o-o-ost! Now, come on. Let's go on the big slide. Big slide, big slide. - No. No. - Yes! - I don't like the big slide. - Yes, yes! Oh. Oh, my God. Hey, Mom, look at me! Come on. Come play. - Josh? - Help me! Josh! Ah! Josh! Okay, okay. Josh! Ha, ha, ha! I got you! I got you! I got you! Oh, my God! You should have seen the look on your face! It was classic. Mom! Yeah. Can you get me and Z some milk? Sure. Oh, hey. How was Play Zone? It was awesome. Yeah? But she was waytoo scared to go on the big slide. Every time. Wait! Grab the 2 %. Let me tell you a secret. You tell her you're going on the small slide. You sneak around to the big line-up. She never has a clue. Hey, you think Z would mind if I have a piece of his garlic toast? Thanks, Z! Ugh. Kevin, don't, please, talk to it like it's real. Give me your glass. Thank you.Here you go, bud. Hey. Hey. What's on your mind? Is it a certain letter, perhaps the last one? Something happened. What do you mean? So, Josh was playing at Play Zone and, uh... It was like for a second... ...I -- I saw -- I saw it. I -- I saw Z. God, I wasn't gonna say anything. But a couple nights ago when I was heading up to bed, I swear I saw something standing in the corner watching me. You know, at first I second-guessed it. I -- I closed my eyes, and I told myself it wasn't there. But it was, Beth. Something was there. Really? No, it was my jacket. Z isn't real. Grow up. Thanks. Look, it's our kid's imaginary friend. Oh, Jesus Christ. Cheer up. Okay. Uh, I like baseball. Mm-hmm. Mostly center field. Oh, yeah, that's for sure. Ah, there's a crazy tiger! Yeah, or is this a leopard or cheetah? What does she look like? Eh, the same, just deader. Oh, shit. You should go up there. Dead bodies freak me out. Yeah. She's our mom. Yeah. Z. Z. Z. Z. Z. Hmm. Hey. I couldn't do it. Let's go. Hey, Anne, it's Beth, Josh's mom. Yeah, hey, listen, I -- I just was wondering if maybe Josh could have a play date with Thomas this afternoon? Oh, okay. Yeah. No, we can -- we can just do it another time. All right, thanks. Hey, yeah. I -- I just -- I haven't seen you guys since -- since Brittany's birthday, and, uh, I just thought maybe Josh could come over and have a play date with her. Hi. It's Josh's mom. Listen, I was -- Wow. Hello? So, how is everything? I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. I'm sure you heard Josh got suspended. Where's Daniel? Uh, he's upstairs, but I think he might be taking a nap, and -- It's like my son's one of those children of the cornfield or whatever. Of course not. I'm sorry about... you know. Ghosting me? Yeah, that. He's a good kid, you know? He's just got a really -- I don't know, a vivid imagination right now. It wasn't just my choice. Daniel was really freaked out. He said Josh was talking about hurting animals. What? No. He would never do that. All I know is that Daniel was coming home crying, and I need to protect my son. - Daniel! - Aaaaah! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God! - Oh, my God, Daniel! Call 911! Daniel! Daniel! Ah! I am so sorry. I don't even know what to say. Just stop it! Just go away! I never want to see you again! It's okay, baby. Mommy's right here. Oh, hi, Mommy. Wanna play? Hi, baby. Yeah, you just -- you let us know if you need anything. Okay, yeah, and -- and we're s-- I -- all right, bye. Jesus. How is he? I don't even know where to start. It's not good. What do we do? Josh! Honey, come and eat! Josh. I've been downstairs calling you. Josh. Joshua, I am speaking to y-- Do you like it? It's Z. Um... I would like you to come down for lunch, please. Okay. Come on. Eat up. I'm not hungry. Well, if you're not gonna eat, at least drink your milk. Make you big and strong, just like Z. Z says I shouldn't. Really? Okay, here we go. I'm gonna drink some. See? It's good, huh? Want some carrots? Why don't we just hire some movers to do this? I don't know. You want to pay for it? Good point. Hey, what's up with Josh today? Uh, I don't know. I guess he's -- he's just a little off. ♪ New friends along the way♪ ♪ We love to sing and we love to play♪ Oh, no way! Nice. Oh, my God.

Get it out. Josh: It's okay, buddy, get it out. You're all right. Well, do you know when he'll be out of his appointment? Well, he wrote my kid a prescription, and now he's having a reaction. He's vomiting. Well, I -- I don't know. Do we put him on something different? You put our son on medication and didn't tell me? You're not here, Kevin. You're not seeing what I'm seeing. You don't understand how bad it is. He threw a kid off a fucking balcony. You don't know that, Beth! He said he didn't do it. Bullshit! Give me the pills. No. Give me the pills. Kevin. Don't. No!

It's happening again, isn't it? Same thing that happened when you were a child. When I heard your son say the name Z, I realized I'd heard it before. What is this? You were a patient of mine, Beth. Your father brought you to me when you were Josh's age. He begged me to help you. He was terrified. Your friend was unlike anything I'd ever encountered. He was... dangerous, destructive, obsessive. Of course, when he stopped bringing you in, I -- I thought you'd outgrown it. I had no idea what had transpired. I want to show you something. Hello, Elizabeth. Hi. Hello, Z. So, Beth, your dad told me that you didn't love him anymore. Why would you say such a thing? Because it's true. Your dad said that you're refusing to go to school. Z says I don't need school. He says he'll take care of me. What happens when you outgrow Z? Every child outgrows their imaginary friend, you know. Z says when I'm older, he'll find me, and we'll get married, and we'll have lots of babies. It's been waiting for you, Beth, and I think it's using your son to try to reconnect with you.
