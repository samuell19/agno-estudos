Do you give a smoke? - It's the last one. - Everything is alright. - Tell me, have you no tact? - Yes, but I have no fire. Well, now they're putting "The Timeless" back on. If it was just "The unemployed", then you would have had a chance. He said that Arthur has been trying to get hold of us. He is looking for two talented actors. - Is there a radio role lying in wait? - I don't know that. He called it a one-act play from real life. Then we're off to good old Arthur. What did you give for that trash bucket? - 200 crowns. - It's too much for that shit. Now Arthur thinks we're broke and out. I get an idea. Come! Get in there. We borrow a Cadillac. Big cars, big roles. (bang) What is happening? (bang) Emma, ​​this is the last time you will be allowed to drive that car. Well, I have no idea where that bump is coming from. You have no clue about anything. And not a stick about how to treat such a device. Now I have driven for 25 years without a single scratch. We are down to the lowest insurance. And what happens? Then the lady gets behind the wheel, and the bonus smokes. But you are allowed to pay it from your household money. I will never be allowed to borrow it. It requires a bit of practice. And some sense! Not one car, Hugo. We find one on the way down. (wheel spoke) Drive carefully, dammit! What the hell are you doing? How are you driving?! Oh damn! God damn it! (loud bang) Hugo? Was it fun? Come on, Hugo. Up and then. Now you have to see, like this. Then look to get to Hugo... er, to yourself. 200... That was too much for that shit. Hugo, have you hit yourself? - I told you so. - Hugo, are you all right? - Where am I? - Consider it a car show. Here you go. Here is the slip. Now the two of us are going out to find a Cadillac for Arthur. Alfred! - What is that? - It's not a moving omnibus. It's a stroller. Come. - Try the other way. - Already tried that. It does not help. - Try another key. - Maybe it was an idea. This one should help. The other way is open. Replacement. Now you are driving properly. Thank you. Ouch! Do not do that. Roll that window down. What the hell is the point? No, left button, man. No, the other one. Idiot! Idiot! (police whistle) It was not me. (engine) (bang) It is a lie. The gods have briefly touched my forehead. Even before the premiere, it is a failure. - Why? - Because the actors are talentless. Talentless? What did the reviewers say about "The Man Who Walked Out?" They wrote: "Only he had kept going." Not that. About me: "Alfred Emanuelsen is a great actor." Zero! "Alfred Emanuelsen is a tall actor." It is something else. Stop! You don't deserve me. Not since the postal coup in England has the world seen anything like this. It's not just a matter of money. It is art. Art must also survive during a period of unemployment. In these difficult times for art, I stand here and offer you - - the roles of your life. Only main roles. Because I know I have talent. And that you are passionate about showing it. This performance can be a success beyond all limits, - - if it is played by artists, by zealots, - - who are passionate about art. You know who I am. - Arthur. - Good old Arthur. I am the brain. If you do what I say, we can be very, very rich in a short time. How much, very rich? I know several unemployed actors who would think - - that five million crowns are a lot, a lot. - Five? - Millions? What you see here is a plan of the toilet at Copenhagen Central Station. Here is the entrance. The toilets. And just beyond, separated only by a wall, is the bank. Here the money is placed in the box on Wednesday at twelve o'clock - - and picked up again on Friday, which gives us... - Playing time. - 36 hours to stage it. The idea is; we have to break through the toilet wall and into the bank. But there is a small catch to the matter. A single problem that separates us from a life under the palm trees. - Madam Svendsen. The pee wife. - How does she look? It is completely irrelevant. It is about us treating the type with psychology and finesse. Now I am Mrs. Svendsen. You are a customer. May I hear? Good day. Lovely weather today. No, no, you fool. One does not converse with a lady who spends the day - - between peeing men and hand soap about the sun and summer. All over again. Here you go. - Good day. So how are we doing today? - No, no, you cod! The bitch is probably full of gout and varicose veins. The highlight of her life is wiping urinals. Then you ask her how she is feeling… Now you are pee wife Svendsen. Look here. Good day. Yes, that's how it should be done. Not too familiar, but correct. You show a bit of respect for her as a woman and a person. That's all. - How much do you tip? - You will probably give a daler. You don't want to. You put in 50 cents like everyone else. You are neither a flotten homer nor a fatty. No one must notice one. I must say. You have calculated it well. Yes. Every era has its heroes. Bonnie and Clyde. Al Capone. Billy the Kid. Otto Leisner. In a short time, Arthur Gabrielsen will join the ranks of legend. There she is. Just like a computer. 10 seconds to open the bag, 22 seconds to open the grid. Can you see? With a key exactly like this one. 22 steps down, like that. In ten seconds she is dressed in a smock, ready for today's chore. Gentlemen, the performance may begin. It is now exactly 13 seconds past 8. In exactly two minutes you will enter. Understood? Good morning, madam. Yes, there is still plenty of room here. I'm afraid that will continue to be the case. These are bad times. It is that inflation. People come and see the sign, and then they hold themselves. Yes, the unrest is spreading. Even the churches are empty. Where do you get rid of your water? I was going to... Now! - I assure you... - Credit is not given. - It was an urgent matter. - But there is no rush with the payment. There are places where it's free for people like you. - People who live beyond their means! - May I then be free! She makes the witch in "Macbeth" look like a Sunday school teacher. - Are you afraid of a small woman? - I have never been afraid of women. Before now. Over my shoulders you see cabin three. That's where it all happens. Any questions? (Japanese) (Japanese) They go home and develop it, and in a month they have the same johns in Tokyo. (washes out) The police! - Good morning. - Good morning. Him, the boy stayed in there for over five minutes. I know someone who has read all of Dostoyevsky in public toilets. Good morning, Mr Hoppe. Is it crazy today too? No worse than yesterday. So it must be progress. Is it a record attempt? - They put it on the bill, right? - Yes. There are moments that seem endless. We will be noticed soon. Not even the thirstiest plumber can have a drain for that long. What is he doing? Help! Help! Help! Help! - God save me! - Open the hell up! - Is there no one looking after the shop? - Doesn't he give it a little too much? - I'm drowning! What are they doing? - Are you decently dressed? Not as long as the obscene water splashing continues! Get started! - Finally. - My Goodness! What have you done? What have I done? What I have done! It's really good! Am I to blame for your installations crashing? - And then onto the floor... - What do I care? - You have to press the button, sir - Pull or drop, push or pull! They are not going to teach me anything! I've been to the toilet before! I intend to appeal to the highest authority. Bullshit! They probably need professional assistance. It's not her fault. They wade in it. Can't you see the lady isn't thrilled about it? I don't enjoy taking a shower in a public toilet - - and get an entire lake right in the face. If you complain, the lady will have a hell of a lot of trouble. Who wants to retrain her? I mean, at her age, right? It's the mechanics. The usual problem in the consumer society. - Imagine all that paper. - They should think about me a little. - Look how I look. - Terrible. Yes, that is the condition. But if you just want to use number two, I can fix your trousers. - It's the least I can do. - Yes! - Thanks. - Cutter knife. Suction cup. Yes, come on. - There it was. - Yes. Then I'm ready! - Goodbye. - Goodbye, thanks. "I am 32 years old. I am tall, blonde with blue eyes." - I've never thought of that. - What? - It is the ideal meeting place. - How? - For people who don't have pep. - What? - Peeps. Don't you know what it is? - No. Peeps. Like me. (humming) I am tall and ordinary. And has lots of pep. - Now I hope... - Yes, yes, yes. Thank you very much for the help. But you don't have to do it for nothing. - You don't have to think about that. - Specific. Be safe and be safe. Consider the establishment here as your second home. - Thank you, we will make use of that. - Thanks. Here is Alfred on the stairs ready to make his entrance. Where are you? You're not there at all. - Am I not there? - God knows you're not. You stand outside and bide your time, right? Nah... Now listen, this is a business - - to five million Danish crowns, good crowns. We only get hold of them by making sure, - - that cabin number three is occupied all the time by one of us. No one but us is allowed to enter there. And it must be timed. Is that understood? Why hasn't anyone figured this out before? Because the police station is right next to the toilets. By the way, won't Madam Svendsen take a look, - - when we go back and forth? We will use our few, but scattered, talents - - to avoid her noticing us. Equipment comedy. Roles must be played. Real human comedy. Masks must be worn. Here is the list of costumes from the Royal Theatre. I'm getting a cart from a dry cleaner. You turn approach the guard, and what do you say? - Good day. - "Good day. It's from the dry cleaners." "We need to clean some costumes." "Thank you," you then say, "we know the way." (whistles) Good day. We know the way. "Undeniably, you love with an unparalleled warmth." "In this point all the others must give way." "My love cannot be described." "It cannot be understood." "Nobody in the whole world has loved like I have." "But the way is new. You have to admit that." I hear that these gentlemen are members of an amateur theatre. Yes, here we are again. And then there should be a receipt... Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Always On Spot. Good day. It's occupied, Mr. When the door is locked, there are customers on the toilet. They can use the second. There are some who are conservative. (violin from cabin three) - Good day. - Good day. - What is it? - The mail is too late, mate. It was busy, damn it. What are you doing there when it is number three? - Combi, madame? - Comme vous voulez, monsieur. - S'il vous plait. - Now!, deux, trois. Merci beaucoup. Now she comes. - Make yourself invisible. - Are you gentlemen missing something? No no! Everything is alright. Thank you thank you. Thanks. (violin playing stops) Thank you, Bach. Or whatever it was. - What do I do then? - Pee. Thank you very much. What did the doctor say, Hoppe? He said it passed. Frederick the Seventh had the same. A royal affliction! They shine on the establishment. - Number one seems to be free. - Thanks. - If you allow. - I came first. There is room next to it. Now you have to decide, Mr. Cod! (shoe shiner makes noise) (laughs) (Sneezes) please, for further education... Buy a little something for the home. Yes please. (shaver buzzes) Move your ass, mate. What the hell? Are you going to streak with paint? I will forcefully give you varnish. - Shut up. It's Arthur. - I'll wait out here for you. The sign. (there is a knock on the door) Then I'll probably show you something really funny. - What's up now? - I know what you're doing in there. - Will you please stop! - Why? They should not be beaked. Go somewhere else. It's a public restroom, not a library. Okay, okay. Then you shouldn't count on any more business from me. And by the way, the light is much better at Easterport. The light! (hair dryer makes noise) Day-o! (there is a knock on the door) Is he there yet? Him the big one? Get him away! Well, are we waiting? I'm waiting for a painter's nose to stick the tomato outside. Well, maybe we could have some fire in the meantime? I don't have any fire. Does not matter. I have stopped smoking. - Guten Tag, Herr... Doctor. - Guten Tag. I am not a doctor. Sie sprichen Dütsch? - Eine kleine bitte. - Ich bin eine Wandergesell. Sie sind schön und wunderbar und alles. Kann... das Pissuhr, baby. - Yes. - Auf dem linksen? Auf der chicen? Letzte möl ich habe gestret war im Sölzburg. Ich muss dahin gehen. Ich bin nur ein Wan... Wan... Wandergesell ich mit Seife gegleissen über dem Floh (real Tyrolean music) (yodeling along) (humming along) Danke schön! Greetings Gott! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Danke schön. See you again. - Service. ...to Per Rontved, who attempts a shot. Excellent goal by Per Rontved! Nice left foot shot. No! It's too crazy. Will you stop the noise! - All noise is turned off! - What? - Not that spectacle! - Yes. Yes. Reduction to 1-2. There aren't many minutes left. What do you think you're doing? We have to be on time. Then look to get started! Shut up and get to work! The ridiculous handkerchief. Do you think you are the Phantom? - What are you doing? - He refuses to cooperate. Come on, man, right? You really do look like a bank robber. (sings in gibberish German) - You must apologize for that. - What the hell is the point? - People are insane. - Insane. Unmannered. And stingy. Smoking right in the litter box. - Greetings Gott. - Please, please. Auf Wiedersehen. Ich bin ja nur eine Wandergesell. Wunderbar, wunderbar. What the hell is the point, you power idiot? It's a long way to Tisserary it's a long way to go it's a long way to Tisserary you are the sweetest girl I know It's me. You always get the best roles. It's a matter of talent. And then you can wear costumes. (says crazy sounds) ...water and bread. Water and bread. - May I help? - Thank you. - That must be a record. - Ninth time. Poor thing. There you go. Thanks. Not my baby, yes, sir that's my baby now yes sir it is my infant no sir it is not my infant yes, sir, it's my infant now (Svendsen screams) Help! Help! Always him. Also a pilot. Well, he won't. Hanne! Hanne! - Do you know that guy? - I've never seen him before. - It's me. - Stick the poor thing something. Good day, madam. It's the police. We are looking for a man in the toilets. I see. This is the police. Everyone in the restrooms, get out immediately. I repeat: It is the police. Everyone in the restrooms, get out immediately. The area is cordoned off. There are no escape options. They might as well get out right away. Aren't you ashamed? - Are you going to disturb people's privacy? - Yes, thank you, that's all right, Mr. Yes it's good. It is well. They are not really smart. - May I ask for the key to the toilet? - Yes, go ahead. Yes. Yes. Go ahead, gentlemen. There is vacant. Sorry. Hello, hello. Hello, excuse me. I'm... It's a wonderful weather today... I have a brother in Scotland Yard over there. Goodbye, bye, bye. Sorry, sir. Excuse me. Indeed. Then you can come out. You are arrested. No pranks. Ridiculous. (hair dryer makes noise) (sound of pants ripping) Where the hell is the pilot? Glorrrious afternoon. (there is a knock on the door) A moment. Hugo has stolen my costume and changed the order. He has stolen my pilot so I have to be a fireman. - But then I found this. - It is the pure kindergarten. - You look brilliant. - I do not want. I want to be a pilot. For five million you would dress up as the Little Mermaid. The deal was that I was to be a pilot. I'll probably give him a shitball. Then look to move on. - I want to be a pilot. - Alfred... For the sake of five million crowns. For my sake. Now if I take your turn. Glorrrious afterrrnoon. You stole my costumes. I just told Arthur. They need to get out of the area. You are making a continuous parking. Give us this day our daily bread. - They will be noted, sir - Thank you very much. Sin carries the punishment in itself, my son. - Well, it runs up today, huh? - No, it just runs straight through. - Sorry. - Step closer, my son. It is... accomplished. - Good night, Mrs Svendsen. - Good night, Larsen. (phone rings) Take it. It wakes up the whole neighborhood. - Take it! - What should I say? Just take it. Hurry up. The Swan Pharmacy. (steps are heard) (grill rattles) - Do you think it's Arthur? - Then he would have said it. Are you there? Are you the one full of pep? - I know you're there. - Reply! Yes, it's me who's full of pep, - - but... I'm busy. I'll be discreet. Can we meet later? Yes. Later. Tomorrow. - Write a few words and a time. - Okay. Are you expecting anyone else tonight? - Juliet calls Romeo. - Romeo here, Romeo here. Come in. - He's gone. - We know that very well, Julie. Otherwise, it's fine here. We are almost all the way through. Alfred! Alfred! Alfred! Not a shit. Not a shit! It is a lie. Can you smell anything? It smells burnt here. (coughs) There are plenty of them. It burns. Juliet to Romeo. Romeo! It was just before the john burned. Hands up! - Never again. I had asthma as a boy. - What happened? Don't worry, it's turned off. There are lots, millions, bundles. Nice work. Finish yourselves. Leave the tool here. I'm waiting in the car. Stop! We can't have any more. Romeo calls Juliet. Romeo calls Juliet. - Juliet hears Romeo. - The carriage stops at the door. Now I understand what you mean by heavy currency. Straighten up. You look like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I have a feeling that dung trunk is transparent. (engine hiccups) - What's wrong? - It's not just any Cadillac. - We can't stay here. - All right, we'll take a taxi. Whoa, just a moment, gentlemen. They are not allowed to park here. Please move the cart. - It has stalled, cannot start. - We must get hold of Falck. I have heard that remark before. And why can't you start? Yeah, it's something about the... kadang... dang... dang axle. It was new. Will you leave the keys with me for a moment? (engine starts) Can I see your driver's license? Yes, just a moment. Alright. Then see to it that the cart is moved. Everything has been thought of, staged. And then a power idiot, an unemployed dilettante puts, - - five million crowns on the street. I was very good as a postman. (engine hiccups) (engine starts) - What do you say then? - Thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent. Mount up and take it. - Yes? - The Paris Express, carriage 34, seat 7. Carriage 34, seat 7. Come! - Now the Tulle Girl is behaving nicely. - And waiting for his Nullerman. Nullerman will not share his Tulle girl with anyone. - What do we do now? - Give the lady this little ticket. Thanks. - What is that? - I have no idea. - Who is it? - I've never seen him before. - Seat number 7. - Well, you haven't? Sorry. - Then come along. - I don't want to go to Paris! The car can only last half an hour and I have chicken left over! Rooster chicken! - What the hell was he going to Paris for? - Yes, what do you think? - He would never come up with that. - Do not you think? He is his friend's friend. No, Alfred! Give me the suitcase. It's probably a little too heavy for you. Shall I give a nap? Nice weather to come to the capital in. - Well, anything new from out there? - Do you want to hold it? That's the way. The path. May we see what you have in your suitcase, ma'am? What the hell?! - Greetings at home. - That's the way. - What the hell! - Where did you do with it? - Me? You've seen me all along. - Hotel Scandinavia. There it was. We take a taxi. - You pay. - 11.50, please. - I can't handle that. - Keep the rest. Fourth floor. What do we do now? (speaks gibberish Swedish) You take the chance. Bye. Bye. So a total of DKK 4,485,600. - How are we going to... - Wait a minute. Can't we hand them out now? I want to go home and sleep. We have been on stage for 24 hours. - The money stays here. - Why? Because when people get money, they get habits, say the statistics. Live in expensive hotels, drink champagne, indulge in immorality - - and is grabbed by the police. That's why we save the money here for six months. They go to the den. And then little by little we can start living life. - Would you like to show me my room? - Which room? - I sleep where the money is. - Here too. (loud snoring) (rinses out) What the hell, you're not even allowed to pee in peace now? (snores) It can't keep going. We'll all end up in an institution. Depressions or nervous breakdowns or something like that. Is there no proper jam? - What would you suggest? - Armistice. In every cold war, a power idiot is going to push the button. - Alfred... - I am in favor of mutual trust. - What do you say, Hugo? - Okay. But I don't want to wash the dishes. A toast to a wonderful collaboration - - about the distribution of DKK 4.5 million. Gentlemen, thank you for a wonderful collaboration. It must be with a spoon. ...unemployment falling, but only after the boldest bank robbery of the year. TV-News now brings a report from the crime scene. Last night, the boldest coup of the year took place at the Main Station. The robbers have drilled their way through the wall from the toilets - - and into the bank's box. The dividend was almost 4.5 million. It is believed that the robbers were distracted in their work, - - in that another half a million kroner is left in the box. The mastermind behind the coup seems to have thought through every little detail. Mrs. Svendsen... Would you mind coming over? I want to ask you: As a toilet attendant, did you get the impression that something unusual was happening? - Where should I look? - They just have to look into the camera. Did you detect anything unusual yesterday? No, so many people come here. Something unusual you must have noticed often? - No I have not. - Not the remotest? - No. - Well. We say thank you, Mrs Svendsen. We immediately go back to the studio. Nothing seen, nothing heard. I call that a performance. No one notices the success of my life. Have you gentlemen never heard of the perfect coup? May I ask for a cup of coffee? (freaky noises) What do you say? (gibberish) Aren't those my two little plumbers? That was funny. Will you allow me to sit down for a while? Thanks. Gentleman. There aren't many left. And to what do we owe the honor, nay, the pleasure, of the lady's visit? You want to think of those who broke into my toilet last night. The dividend was almost five million. - That was exactly what we saw on TV. - Yes, we saw the lady on the screen. As far as I understood, there were no leads to follow. You yourselves, you... didn't see anything. If you don't have anything sensible to say, you better shut up. - I guess I don't really understand. - I would like to elaborate on the matter. But not here. Shouldn't we meet at your place of residence? Then we talk much more pleasantly. Should we say 6pm? - Will it suit you? - We live... Thanks. I know the address. A small piece of food in all modesty? Yes, just a little on a saucer. As I use to. I will look forward to that. See you again, gentlemen. There she is. Is the lady gracious to raise her arm? - Thanks. - Here you go. Cheers. And congratulations to us. Yes, that's not too much to say, is it? 4.5 million is also a kind of money. It will be one for each. And one and a half for me. I hope you gentlemen agree with me? Um... It is the first million that is difficult to earn. The others come by themselves. Down underground I have used eyes and ears, - - gained a lot of experience and many ideas. I only need capital. Millions and millions. We first need to see how many there are. There was quite a lot that was burning. - Many that burned. - Stacks. When you left half a million lying around, you must have got quite a lot? - Nah, that... - Someone came who... - Disappearing a bit. - It doesn't work. Well, now let's let the good mood displace the dark clouds. Now let's see how many there are. Let's take a look at the ones, share them and enjoy the cool schnapps. - Cheers. - Cheers. Yes, gentlemen... What are we waiting for? (bird whistle) Nemesis. The brutal irony of fate. What do we learn from it? That you can't trust anyone. - That's the way the world is. - Yes. This is how the world's worst amateurs are. I could have told myself that. Such a dilettante of a postman. Such a cheat of a war captain. Such a home-brewed Tyrolean, such a pitcher of a Scotsman. Our Lord preserved! The company of you gentlemen does not please me. I have more important things to attend to. - Was I that bad as a postman? - You were gorgeous! - If they say... - You were gorgeous! And when you were a sailor. When you were a hippie, your girl couldn't recognize you. I think I could play the pitcher. It's the role of your life! But the monk! And when you were an angler. Well, friends. Should we let the good mood and infectious laughter - - displace the black clouds? What do you mean by that? (sings a fanfare) - Nah! Do not close! - Let's enjoy the view! I am the brain. Did you really think I was dropped behind the back of a wagon? Did you really think that a brilliant mind - - let himself be tricked by a Mrs. Svendsen? I forgot my bag. Such a bunch of originals. - Huge, flat-faced baboon! - Fine. - You big bean hat. - Thank you very much. - Bean rush! - At your service. It was very close. I was... She came in… Gentlemen... Gentlemen! One for all and... ...all on one board! --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
