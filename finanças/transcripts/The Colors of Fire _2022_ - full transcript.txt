Madeleine, the President has arrived. Thank you, Gustave, Is Paul downstairs? I haven't seen him. The music? As you requested, madam. Mr. Dupré. Have you seen Paul? No, madam, but he was here earlier. Paul should be here. Perhaps ask your lady's companion. Madam. the flowers. Perfect. Léonoe. have you seen Paul? No, I'm looking too. - Would you mind... - Of course. Can't be that hard to open a testament, damn it! It's urgent. I'm doing my best. Charles. Find a way or I'm dead. Excuse me, Mr. Pericourt, have you seen Paul? No. Andre, we need Paul. Where is he? I don't know. Neitherjustice nor loyalty nor God... You'll be a great author. but for now, you're Paul's tutor. So go find him. Goon. Have you seen Paul? Not recently. Louise. did you see Paul upstairs? No. Sorry, I haven’t seen him. Paul. Paul! Paul? That touches me greatly. Marcel Pericourt’s funeral overshadowed by terrible tragedy Very well. Let us begin. "To my daughter, Madeleine Puncourl..." represented by Miss Léonce Picard. "I bequeath my shares in the bank I founded. and the manor I built. For my grandson Paul. three million francs in bonds shall be managed by his mother until he is of age. To my brother Chartes. I bequeath... 200.000 francs. To my loyal colleague, Gustave Joubert...“ Wait a minute. Is it even legal to give three million francs to a vegetable who'll croak like his grandfather? The kids dead! Will you send his money to the cemetery? C'mon. it's true! You don't give millions to a stiff! Let's carry on. Goodbye. Miss Picard. my condolences to Madam Pericouri. Thank you. Come with me. If Chanes wishes to contest the will... Out of the question. Chanes is hot-headed. but... we'll make him see reason. It's disappointing, but he's not out on the street. If I may. he's not far. Charles used his position as deputy to favor certain public works companies. He paid big bribes... Up to five figures. I hear. ...but he skimped on the material. Business as usual. you might say. Unfortunately. three workers fell through the floor and are hospitalized. In bad shape. So you see. sir. Charles‘ paniamentary immunity might not last long. I understand. Mr. Péricourl's personal safe was not in the estate. Please tell Madeleine. Trust me. Of course. yourfuture is cutout. Madeleine's ex—husband has disappeared. You'll wed her and become bank president. It's easy. Not so fast. Come on. Joubert. With what happened to her son... It's true. she'll need a man of experience by her side. Precisely. Gustave. she trusts you. Ask her to give me a hand. I have two girls to marry. I'll see, but I can't promise anything. Put that here. Yes. madam. Thank you. Leonce. It's pretty. I'm happy you like it. It's very nice. The new bedroom. Andre. what happened to Paul? Throwing himself out the window... No one understands. Perhaps you know? I don't know, it's very... Imean... I'm sorry. Andre. It's not your fault. Forgive my lack of tact. But the question haunts me incessantly. It was an act... No one understands. Paul won't be needing a tutor anymore. It's time I let you go. Thank you for everything. If I can help you... Actually. yes. I'd like to work as a Journalist. - Something modest. - Yes. of course. Thank you. We obsen/e a slight decrease in mortgage values, but it's a minor, almost mechanical phenomenon. There's no need to worry. We'll see about this later. I'm clumsy. Forgive me, but... something else cannot wait... Your uncle, He‘s gotten himself in a fix. He's a good-for-nolhing. My father made his career. HE'S a Pél‘iOOUI’t nonetheless. It would be unfortunate for the bank’s reputation. Tell him to come see me. Before I forget. could you ﬁnd André Deloourt a job in journalism? I believe he's a fine writer. I'll see to it. He wanted to die. Gustave... You were unhappy and alone. Madeleine... I've always been yourfriend. More than ever... I'll do anything to accompany you. - To help you... - Thank you. To love you. Forgive me. Well? She'll receive you. She could've just said "yes." This business is costing me a fortune! The housing inspectors: 100.000. Investigators: 80.000. The magistrate: 90.000! Plus your workers at the hospital. At least they're out of danger. Whereas me... You seem out of sorts. And you're doing well? - I'm sorry. - Goodbye. ma‘am. That was the eleventh one. I'll see 100 if need be. lwon't entrust my son to lust anyone. Miss, do you speak French? You cannot... Léonce! You can't hire a Polack who doesn't even speak French! Maybe I can. - Thank you. Mr. Dupre. - Of course. Enough about me. Tell me everything. The newspaper. I want every detail. Look. This is wonderful. - Your own column! - It's thanks to you. No. Thank you. Gustave. From now on, we will meet at lhe bank. It Will be more... professional. Very well. Excuse me, madam. Mr. Charles is here. Fine. Girls. go keep your cousin company. I'll take them. sir. What brings you, Uncle? If you only knew. I ask for nothing more. Tell me. - What a story! - Yes. And to appease them all... I need 300.000 francs. Honestly. I don't have the money. I‘m dead financially. Madeleine. Charles. Sell your shares. You can't be serious. That’s for my girls' dowries. lwon't be able to help you. Why not? You say you‘re dead financially. You don't give millions to a stiff. I can't send money to the cemetery. Come on. girls. on the double! In fact... What kind of mother are you. Madeleine? Excuse me? What kind of mother raises a child who desperately wants to die at age eleven? Can you believe it? My own niece! With all We done for her. - Calm down. - Good sense of humor. She refused to lift a ﬁnger to help me. I can help you. We're talking about 300.000 francs. Thank you. Gustave. The Secret. Miss Gallinato... My letters to you are surely drowned under the mounds from admirers. Nonetheless. I will never stop writing. For thanks to you. lam alive again. Your voice and interpretation are the ultimate portrayal of precision and beauty. Ihope to hear from you one day. but regardless, I will listen to you forever. Paul. your ear. You're still up? l lust finished. Off to bed. Here. For Solange Gallinato. I know. Good night. Thank you. Opera again. To what do i owe the pleasure? I'm here about the American crisis. It's coming. And banks will be the first hit. The government will save the big ones, but let the others sink. Like yours. Isn't that alarmist? |Slt ﬁll the Finance Commission. Trust me. Gustave said nothing. Of course not. Joubert is an imbecile! He's like a cuckolded husband: always last to know. What do you suggest? I'm selling my shares before they're worth nothing and investing in Romanian oil. Don't say i didn't warn you. Why would you wish to inform me? I'm thinking of myself. I'm not heir to a fortune. The Périoourt bankruptcy would cost me my deputyship and rurn me. I'm watching out for my daughters' future. You'd be Wise to do the same. If you‘re ruined. Paul is too. VWII American crisis affect France? You know... How to put this? Newspapers are like politicians. They say... what suits them. Bankers too. So. who to believe? Me. Madeleine. You know, France... France is doing very well. Our ﬁnance system is admired worldwide. Charles assures me that the American crisis... Forgive me. but Charles is an incompetent deputy and a pitiful ﬁnancier. Believe me... our economic model is indestructible. Would it not be sensible to invest in less-exposed sectors? Your father's fortune was in banking. I'm talking about today. not yesterday. I heard about Romanian oil. No. not that. It would be madness. I understand wanting to diversify. But if you must choose oil. look to Iraq. Their stock is down. It's the moment to invest. Their deposits are said to be enormous. Almost inexhaustible. Romanian oil is doing fabulously. Does your intuition outweigh the Paris Stock Exchange? I want a report this week. - Hello, sir. - Hi. Mr. Dupre. From Miss Gallinato? Yes. I'm afraid to read it. "My dear Paul. I have read all your letters. Do not think I am indifferent...“ I could not write sooner because I was ill. They say my heart is sick. It has beaten too much. or perhaps too fast. A beautiful illness. don’t you think? What you wrote about The Secret ovenrvhelmed me. No one I know seems to understand this piece. No one ever asks me to sing it. If is surely too modern. But I love this piece. the last one composed for me by Maurice Grandet. my great love. before he died. I am impatient to discuss with you, my darling. I’m sending you invitations to my recital at the Garnier Opera House. Come without fail. Your Solange. Good evening. I'm sorry. your chair can't stay in the aisle. Question of security. You can listen to the recital from the back of the room. I'm sure we'll hear very well. Our seats are in row three. That is where we will sit. If not. have the police forcefully evict a cripple. The photographers will love every minute. Be careful! At ﬁrst sight You understood who I was You understood my secret At your first smile You were my light You loved me completely since our romance is a mystery Let us make our love a secret My heart gives itself unconditional/y It is all yours. forever... Bravo! Paul? My little Paul! I saw you in the orchestra. I recognized you. YOU wrote those beautiful letters. My dear Paul, it was you. The Secret... was for you. - Thank you, ma'am. - N0! Call me Solange. Thank you. Solange. My God. You are so beautiful. The car is here. Paul. it's time to leave. Thank Miss Gallinato for the seats. It was nothing. Martha. Tickets for Milan. I'm singing at La Scala next month. If your mother wants to give you a treat. Goodbye. Until we meet again. No financial crisis is coming. Romanian oil is bad business. and banks risk nothing. Have I understood correctly? That's about right. You don't mind being the sole person who thinks that? As long as I'm right. no. You know. my intuition made your bank what it is today. No. Gustave. it was my father's intuition. I fear you might have none at all. Come. Leonce. Before you leave... It's about Miss Picard. l audited expenses at your residence. What a surprise! Falsified accounts. False bills. Profits shaved off rugs. ﬂoors. lights. parquet. furniture... Even Mr. Paul's wheelchair. This is awkward. I earn so little. All thieves claim to be poor. That's why they steal. Goodbye. It's my fault. Leonce. ldon't pay you enough. I'll double your wages and pay this absurd debt. - No. - I'll write you a check. But don't tell Gustave. Thank you. Thank you. Madeleine. I'm worried about Gustave. He says there's no crisis. He's the only one. What would you do? I don't know. If I had money. I'd do like everyone else. I'd invest in Romanian oil. I asked our economicjournalist. The crisis wrll hit France. What about Romanian oil? Like everyone else. he says it's made fabulous returns for ten years. According to him. France will always need oil, not banks. You're leaving your father‘s bank to invest in oil. Nothing escapes you. Are you sure you wish to transfer all your assets? Everything, without exception? Is this wrse? Up until now, I was your boss. Now I am your principal client. We have every reason to stay on good terms. You're right. Madeleine is leaving her father’s bank. What can I say? I'm the only person she won't listen to. She's investing her entire fortune in Romanian oil. It's quite irrational. Very feminine. I might add. Is your information regarding Romanian oil reliable? Who are your sources? Bankers' indiscretions. Trust me. Romanian oil will soon collapse. Here. A toast. To Iraqi oil. Mom. what if Mr. Dupre can't start the car? Our train is at 7:00. We can't spend all day at the station. Thank you. Have you seen Le'once? No. not today. Let me help you. Romanian oil goes under Thousands ruined Our trip to Milan is canceled, honey. You're ruined. Believe me, I'm sorry. This was your plan. wasn't it? You and Charles connived to make me worry about the crisis. You pretended to be overwhelmed in order to incite me to sell everything! You didn't trust me. You needed the price of Romanian oil to rise to buy Iraqi oil at bargain rates... Is that it? Tell me. Gustave! Did you personally invest in Iraqi oil? Indeed. But... I told you about it and you refused to listen. Our paths will cross again. I have control over Paul's bonds. and I'll... Bonds? Paul does not have a single share left. Remember? I asked you with great insistence if you wanted to transfer all assets without exception. Without exception. YOU can sell the Pericourt mansion. You won't get much because you're pressed for time. but it will provide a modest income for you and Paul. Yes, modest. You let my entire fortune slip away. No. Madeleine. You squandered your fortune while I built mine. Not the same. Come with me, madam. Don’t stay here. It's so unfair. I don't know how l'll manage. Poor Paul. You're the only friend we have left. dearAndre. I'm here. Paul. The day of Grandad's funeral... I threw myself out the window because... because... Paul? My little man. Another nightmare? Paul. Paul? Yes. yes. I saw nothing. Ifailed at everything. Forgive me. Forgive me. Hello. madam. I brought my uniform. Here are the keys... Have you found a new job? Don't worry about me. I'm sorry for you. Mr. Dupré. What do... How does one... Imean... in real life. You learn fast. - Goodbye. madam. - Mr. Dupre. Everything alright, kids? Very good. Here, the paper. Thank you. sweetheart. Vladi. wash Paul up and we eat. Hello. Gustave. Hello. Uncle. Joubert Jet Engines And hello to you too... dearAndre. So the bank wasn't enough. Gustave? Always more. Taxi! Mr. Dupré? Madam Pericourt. Imagine that! I'm happy to see you. Get in. please. What a coincrdence running into you. l was thinking about you. I need someone for a lob. What kind of job? An investigation. into people. And I was wondering... If I was that kind of man? You needed a rogue so you came to the working class? Not at all. Mr. Dupré. For a banker's daughter. worker and rogue must be the same. l was mistaken. Mr. Dupre. I apologize. Investigate into who? Aformer banker. a deputy and a famous Journalist. 1.000 francs a month. plus expenses. That's a huge sum. Then do it yourself. Okay. Why are you doing this? I saw what they did to you. To you... and to Paul. One last thing... Madam Pericourt. If you want us to get on. don't treat me like a fool. You pretended to happen on my taxi when I saw you waiting for me on my corner. This is on me. Hello. The government. your competitors. the press... After tonight. half will be envrous, the others enemies. - In 3 months. they'll be yours. - Three? Yesterday, you said one. Ambitious projects tend to run late. My paper has supported you for three years. Exactly. I need support. not comments. Gentlemen. good day. Andre. you know my daughters. They love your column. - Come over for dinner. - Sure. C'mon. let's go. This is our moment. girls. Gentlemen. Your attention. please. Many of you came for the buffet. So I shan't be long. After three years of hard work. three years of intensive research... AteliersAeronautiques. which i have the honor of managing, proudly announces the trial run of a revolutionary new engine in three months. An engine that will equip the world's ﬁrst... jet aircraft. Yes. my friends. It Will be French. This aircraft engine. without propellers, will attain the speed of sound. But we'll settle for 450... to 500 mph. To start With. I'm joking. Enough theory. Sometimes images say more than a long speech. Bravo. Fabulous. No, please! No photos. Good job, Joubert. Congratulations. Mr. Minister. Bravo. Joubert. So. industry beats banking? More than ever. To order, the State needs a trial run. A conclusive one. You will have one. And your charming wife? She shouldn't be long. Very well. I came. My God. I don‘t believe it. What time is it? You already sold it! A 1.000 franc watch. You're a rascal, you know. No. Stop. I'm already late. He'll be furious. Who cares? Don‘t say that. he pays. - Anatole, still at the ministry? - Yes. - You know my daughters? - No. Come for dinner one night. Say Tuesday? Tuesday, okay? Three months? I'm at the end of my rope financially. I Will make you immensely rich. Be patient. I put every last dime in your business. We need orders! Money! I believe I‘ve understood. You could‘ve shown up on time. I made the effort to show up. Some grace at last. Madam Joubert, ravishing as ever. Thank you. How are you. Mr. Minister? There you go. What? You gonna have a fit? Give me ecstasy Respond to my tenderness Respond to my tenderness 0h. give me Give me ecstasy... Are you okay? Vladi, a glass of water please. It's nothing. See? It's already over. You need rest. The Berlin Opera. darling. The Third Reich has invited me to celebrate German music. A program with Bach, Beethoven. Brahms and Wagner. Chancellor Hitler will be there in person. Mom! And so. I intend to offer them... a historic recital. It Will be a great moment. These old bones. It's about time for your old Solange to head backstage. He's so cute! For the dowry. we agreed to 500.000 francs, right? Yes. I understand your son Lucien‘s confusion. I couldn‘t chose either. Hey. stop it. You‘re drunk. No. I‘m not. Hello. Vladi. Mr. Dupré! Paul, come say hello. Hello. madam. - Remember Mr. Dupré? - Sure. Hello. Hello, Paul. I'm happy to see you. You look well. - I am well! - The opera. Still Miss Gallinato's admirer? She's giVing a recital in Berlin for the Reich dignitaries. Wagner. Schumann. Brahms! A recital in Berlin? - Good gracrous. - For Chancellor Hitler. Mr. Dupré? Aﬁfth-ﬂoor walkup is not ideal for us. I can imagine. Mr. Joubert is very nervous. He's having difficulties. The explanation would be technical. I‘m all ears. In that case. He initially worked on a radial compressor. but it was a bad choice. Now he‘s working on an axial compressor. but he lost one full year. This has made his partners impatient and the government... skeptical. The clock is ticking. He has no room for error. Someone should give our dear Gustave a hand. Absolutely. As forAndré Delcourt... he is very calm. Leads a quiet life. Works hard. doesn‘t go out. He has a whip. An exotic. colonial object. Used. It's all he needs. His weak spot is his commitment. He got his paper to blindly support Joubert. He was paid. but it'll be hard to prove. However... for Mrs. Joubert. I believe we have what we need. Fabulous. Thank you. Mr. Dupré. Madam Pericourt. Madeleine. Then goodbye. Madeleine. Goodbye. Mr. Dupre. A lady is waiting for madam. She wouldn't say her name. She asked... Thank you. I‘ll take care of it. Hello. Leonce. I let myself in. Gustave will be home soon... No, he's in a meeting at the Ateliers until 5 or 6 o'clock. Come sit with me. The new decoration is lovely. Listen... Madeleine... I understand lovrng men... but having two husbands... You wed Gustave Joubert while married to Robert Ferrand? That‘s called bigamy. Judges dislike that. you'd go to prison. No. Not prison. Don't think of running. Your bag please. Come now. Besides. you wouldn't get far with what you steal from Gustave. Nice calling cards. I‘ll keep the passport. What do you want? You will be my eyes. I want everything on Joubert. Who he talks to. dines With. signs contracts with. The presents he gives clients. Bribes he hands out to politicians. The journalists he buys. everything. Don't sort. I‘ll do that. If you hide anything. the police will receive your two marriage certificates. I forgot. I'm hiring your husband too. He's never worked. Never too late. trust me. I want him to get a job at Ateliers Ae'ronautiques. If he's not there in one week. you‘re both going to jail. He'll learn a profession there: espadrilles. It was Gustave's idea. It's him to a tee. You don't stand a chance. We‘ll see. Unless they want billiards experience. We‘ll see. What will happen to us? I'm warning you. I could never stand prison. What’re you talking about? - We'll ﬁnd a way. - In one week? What does your2nd husband like? Other than my wife? Nothing but planes and cars. That‘s a start. The minister‘s wife invited you for lunch? She's so dull. Perhaps, but I need her husband. He's an ass. Listen. Léonce. l... Pull over! That's the hat I wanted! Okay. Guess I'll have a smoke. Hello. - You have Cigarettes? - Sure. One box. ldon‘t give a damn about your Blue Train Special. Screw your Bentley. Sell it cut-rate. dump it. I don't care. i want my dough. You hear? You got two weeks. lcouldn't help but overhear you. You mentioned a Blue Train? Not many people know it. - The Bentley? - Yeah. There are only four in the world. I see you‘re a specialist. You're selling one? To a friend. yeah. Can I buy you a drink? - It‘s a mythical car. - I know. V6 engine! 147 horsepower. she‘s a rocket. We'll never make better. Gustave. what are you doing? This man has a Blue Train for me. Hang on, I said someone else was ﬁrst. I can try. but there‘s no guarantee. Excuse me. My wife. Madam Joubert. - Mister...? - Robert Ferrand. Ferrand. Mr. Ferrand was recently discharged. He needs a job. There must be something at the Ateliers. I wouldn‘t say no. Very well. You ready? I'm coming. Mr. Ferrand... I'll see you soon. Robert. Can you replace me tomorrow! Again? - We‘re haying a baby. - You said that last month. Hi. Louise. How are you. Aubin? CONFIDENTIAL How are you. Louise? Fine. and you? - That's the boss? - Who else? He was never easy. but now... he's a real pain. - Robert! - I'm sorry. Forgive me. You're too pretty. Turn it up a notch. More. More. Do what I say. Go on. Fire! Sabotage. Sabotage. Boss. for the Blue Train Specral... Leave me alone! A promising beginning. I hope Ferrand is a better guard than husband. - Good day. Madeleine. - You too. I forgot. I have something for Paul. Thank you. Mr. Dupre. That‘s very sweet. Is it about the opera? In a way. See you Tuesday. Mr. Dupré gave me these articles. Look. Boycott of Jewish shops in Germany Solange! They‘re boycotting Jewrsh shops. "Hitler institutes merciless combat against Jews. Giant auto-da-fe! 20.000 anti-German books bumedl“ - Darling, you must know... - Look. Arnold Gassner. I know him. Excellent composer. That‘s the point. "Dismissed by Conservatory for refusing to compose a Nazr hymn." There are things you cannot understand today. Trust your old Solange. I promise you that this recital will be a great moment for the Third Reich. And for my career... maybe the greatest. Reich‘s new darling See? They Will receive me like a queen. i can‘t tell you the program l‘m preparing. It's a surprise. But it will be... Oh. my God! I'm sorry, madam. We must go. Shut up. Vladi! Dear Solange. what you are doing for Mr. Hitler is not compatible with my love for you... I‘m in the government and l hearwhat people say. Three extra weeks for a lost package! When it contains custom-made products, that's the time it takes. How could you have lost it? I didn‘t. it was stolen. Look here. we lost one year with your compressor thingy. Radial. A radial compressor. Mr. Deloourt! I know the way. The paper never believed in you. I went out on a limb. On a limb... Tonight's headline. "Ateliers, an industrial and patriotic triumph for France." Not spectacular enough? - Listen... - What will I look like? Like what you are. A nobodyjournalist who's paid a fortune to generate advertising space. What about me? I funded your folly! How will I pay my daughters‘ dowries? lput everything on the line. My career‘s at stake. Your ruin is mine. Both of you tire me. You... Shall I disclose your "impartial" support? You want to carry on? Or lose everything now? Here's what we'll do. We‘re going to make this marvel work and put things right. I need three weeks. If your plan fails, the Ateliers will shut down. I lose everything. And I lose all credit. I tell the paper what? Three weeks. That's all I need. That new? Joubert has the key. He‘s the one who opens and closes it now. He's unbelievable. Dear Solange, what pains me... is not your recital. Hello. It's your admiration for these people. Let‘s set things straight. You hear me? I think Paul knows what‘s what now. Vladi. may i have a glass of water? l was so thirsty. Okay. I’ll get going. Goodbye. Good day. Union Bank of Switzenand Union Bank of Switzenand The Ateliers Aéronautiques, Madam Joubert... what an ambitious undertaking! Under extreme duress, I hear. Mr. Renaud. it‘s the reason for my visit. I see. Should things turn to your husband's disadvantage. he wouldn't want the Slate... Exactly. Your ad says that your bank... offers perfectly discreet private accounts. Let me explain. we have an entirely novel system. It‘s our very own invention: numbered accounts. We open accounts with no identity. Just a number. Which leads... nowhere. But you must know which person corresponds to which number. This notebook is the only possible connection. It is either in the safe or With me. The secret is absolute. Not one person could link our accounts with our clients‘ identities. My husband will be impressed. The moment could be soon. He‘ll need to quickly make arrangements. We are speaking of... 800.000 francs initially. I'm pleasantly surprised. Look, my career is at stake. And I risk my daughters’ future. The latest trials should reassure me. But there‘ve been so many setbacks. It will work! It‘s worked twice. why wouldn‘t it work now? That. I don‘t know. You know we‘re running late! Get to work! Look at you! Chit chat and prattle! Bunch of lazy bums! Yes. lazy! Good for nothings! Get to work! Hey. The boss is out of cigs. Here, hurry up. No way. The store's a mile away. Then get a move on. Two miles back and forth. Gustave... I‘m worried. If anyone here should be worried. it‘s me. You don't have children. - What are you doing? - Sorry. sir. What were you doing? I'm worried about the photo. What photo? When this shoots off. reporters will rush forward to take photos. -Yes. and? - I was thinking... It's a shame. This prototype is exceptional. We should polish her up. Make her shine. You don‘t want photos With oil streaks. - Where's the janitor? - No one knows. Find him. What? I don‘t know hoW... You won‘t be disappointed. Hello. Gentlemen. Tonight. I would simply like to show you the extraordinary power of this turbojet engine... made by Joubert Engines. We‘ll make a short demonstration. Afterwards. the team and I will gladly answer any questions and provide explanations. So. Bravo! Gentlemen. Mr. Joubert! What happened! He can't be serious. Is this the end for you? G. Joubert's "Revolutionary Turbojef” trial run turns into fiasco Miss. I need a double of this. 8.000 francs. For a few pages? This is three or four years old. The man who kept it wrote with different pens. different inks. I‘ll need to do the same. I must simulate the times of day when entries were made. for this affects the calligraphy. It's worth 8.000. Not to mention. you‘ll Want certain changes. Right? Three lines to add. At the front. 6.000. 6.000. Alright. How long will it take? Two months. And ifl need it in ten days, it‘ll be 8.000? Indeed. 3.000 francs today. No more. Madam. Have I thanked you enough. Mr. Dupré? Absolutely. Not to worry. Please follow me. I'm going to eat every macaron. I don‘t think so. Angelique. don't say that. Yes, boss. Perfect. I advise you to hide for a few days. You won't be safe. No one was home? No. Staff‘s day off. Rotten luck. Was there much money? Very little. What's important... were my research blueprints. They have great value. And Madam Joubert? She was out. She‘ll be here shortly. And the key was... In the cigar box. Making scratches when you have the key is odd. don't you think? It almost gives the impression they were purposely made to simulate a robbery. Are you accusing me? Accusing you? You can‘t be serious. But you see. when you rob a home like this. and you have the good fortune to find everyone gone... you bring crates. You park a truck nearby to cart away anything of value. By definition. a robber breaks in from outside and the glass falls inside. Here it's the opposite. Very strange. Well. l‘ll draft my report. Let's go. No. these don't go together. I said chronologically. Kids. I'm late but it was well worth it. Paul, I was wondering... No. you‘ll ﬁnd it tiresome. What. Mom? Nothing. I had an idea. but I don‘t Want to bother you. Mom! Would you like to go see Solange's recital in Berlin after all? I managed to get these. l have one small favor to ask you. Anything at all. There must be some way. No. there isn't. The Ateliers are closing and everyone goes home. Clear enough? How's it possible? Look around. Sabotage. We're victims of a plot. A plot? Whose? Competitors. the Germans. the government... Take your pick. But i promise you. I will find out. I‘m ruined. That's right. Fool. I'm ruined. Andre. Ruined. They took my column from me. I'm leaving the paper. Get on! Be careful. Port for the young man. Little rascal. Customs. Your papers please. Here. Are you Polish? No. I'm Slovak. But i have good German friends. I don't speak Czech. - Thank you. - Your welcome. Have a good trip. Madam Joubert? That's right. Have a good trip. So. Madam Joubert. you're bankrupt. My husband tried to hold out. what can i say? Precisely. What do you have to say? The project is quite far along. My husband is loath to see his hard work thrown away. He‘d like his research to carry on. In the interest of the scientific community. Recent trials were not very conclusive. To the contrary. There were tWo hypotheses. Now we knoW exactly What to do. Then why not carry on? The Frenchman is by nature impatient. No one has the heart to Wait. I confess. my husband is quite disappointed in his country. Those are? Yes. These are. In this operation. your husband is perfectly disinterested? Absolutely. Major. Intellectual work is nota commodity in France. Your husband plans on freely offering the scientiﬁc community his research results? That's correct. With the exception of a few ancillary expenses. My husband wanted 600.000 Swiss francs. Isaid: "Gustave... that's not reasonable. You had expenses. but people will think you're self-interested.“ My argument paid off. He recalculated and l was right: 500.000 Swrss francs. - That‘s a lot. - Yes. it is. The cost of research today is horriﬁc. Tell me, Major. the Reich's glorious air force... How are your turbojets coming along? These are extracts. Drawings, blueprints, test results... and four pages from the last report, With recommendations. I leave tomorrow. Then you‘ll have an answer tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Mr. Gassner. You‘re on. It's beautiful. don't you think? Beautiful? The chorus of the Hebrew slaves of Babylon. beautiful? If you're on the Jews' side. go ahead and applaud. Arrest her! I have bad neWs, madam. My superiors ﬁnd your expenses overpriced. I'm sorry. I‘m disappointed myself. but I understand. To be honest. my husband thought we should turn to the Italians. - The Italians have no money. - Of course not. But that's my husband for you. He‘s stubborn. "No one in Europe has money. but when one truly wants. one ﬁnds a way." He says Mr. Mussolini has no intention of being Mr. Hitler's lackey. Personally. Major. I confess... that‘s all over my head. Like I said. madam, my superiors are not favorable... but it‘s my decision. If we were to agree upon the cost... how would your husband want to be paid? Half in cash. Reichsmarks would be perfect. Reichsmarks? For the remainder, here are bank details. Ideally. the funds would come from a foreign company. Miss Gallinato. we‘re putting you on a train to Paris. As of today. you are no longer allowed to enter Germany. The bitch! - Are you certain? - Absolutely. The documents concern research abandoned last year. not current research. Madam Joubert sold us unusable documents! - I shall see to her. - I‘ll have the train stopped. No. no. no! We must be discreet. The train makes no stops before the border. We'll pick her up there. Send the border post her description. Get me a car! Fast! Hun'y! Major. we‘re blocked. Clear that away! Right now! Border 10 km Stop. your papers! Stop! Look at me. Blond... Get moving! Your papers!

The charm of the countryside. The ﬁrst day‘s bouquets Lilacs of Flanders Shadowy softness... And you... Bouquets of the retreat Roses tender The colors of fire In the distance... Mr. Dupré? I wanted to ask you... I‘m listening. Would you like to come lie down on me? With great pleasure, Madeleine. Hel... Hello. Have a... I‘d like to invest money. Yes. Yes. A personal fortune. perhaps. madam... Ferrand. Maybe I could make a deposit on Tuesday? Tuesday... Yes. very well. Perfect. Before I leave. could you tell me where... Of course. Last door on your left. Mr. Renaud! What? Gentlemen. this is absurd. Sorry. old chap. The judge received a letter and must follow up. We hear that your bank helps French taxpayers commit fraud by placing their money in Switzerland. That‘s against the law. What are you looking for? The letter says you have a register with taxpayers‘ names and the sums they deposited. That is absurd. This Was in the toilets. Hidden behind the water tank. This yours? It looks like it but... it‘s impossible. Someone stole it. By Jove, there‘s a smart set in here. Fine sums too. It is strictly impossrble. Wait. The toilets. It was her. It was her. It was the tart. It was the tart! She... It was the tart. It's her. it Was the... I suggest you explain it to the judge. You seem anxious. dearAndre. Everything‘s well at the paper? Of course. Just fine. Thank you. I have a migraine. Drink a bit of this lovely wine. it‘ll do you good. - I won‘t be able to stay long. - Of course. One main course and off you go. Time for the pork. I insisted on seeing you. because... now that Paul is doing better. now that he's doing well... It was time to thank you. Thank me for what? I know exactly what you were for my son. Everything you did for him. And I wanted to assure you that such kindnesses are never lost. A little under the weather? Get some rest. Gentlemen. Police search. Are you joking? Does it look like I am? C'mon. men. But... I demand an explanation. The judge has a notebook with the identities of numerous people who have Swiss bank accounts to dodge French taxes. And me? Your name is in it, alongside the sum of 400.000 francs. - I don't have that. - That‘s what we‘re checking. Captain! There's something behind this. Reichsmarks. Mr. Deloourt? No! And lots of them. You‘ll have to come With us. No. no. Don‘t touch me! Let me go! You‘re hurting me! Yes. what? Hello. Mr. Joubert. Please. Make yourself at home. Thank you. Could you tell us Where your wife is? My wife? Excuse me. I haven't heard from my wife in several days. Now that I‘m ruined. I doubt I'll ever see her again. Well. she‘s in Germany. She visited the German Ministry of Aviation. She met twice with a certain Major Dietrich. - It‘s impossible. - Il's certain. Since then. she‘s nowhere to be found. Yourwife has disappeared into thin air. This is absurd. Not really. French counterespionage conﬁrms that your research documents were seen in the German Ministry. She could easily be waiting to join you with the sales proﬁts. Simple deduction. You can't prove anything. How do you explain a bank transfer for 200.000 Swiss francs to your company account from a German firm? It‘s a plot. The courts Will decide. Thank you. You're free. Léonce. Free to do what? 20.000 francs in cash should help see you through. Madeleine... Paul adored you. Leonce. Even I... Come now. let‘s not get sentimental. You can start a new life. Don‘t be too hard on yourself. One. it‘s too late. And maybe you had no choice. Take care. Thank you. My Darling, everything I ever loved is here. All that was missing was you. So now... all this belongs to you. Once you’ve seen everything. throw away all my old stuff. alright? Don't let yourself be submerged by regrets. Look at me, thanks to you, lhave none. Think of me from time to time. but above all. be happy. You were the light of my life. I love you. my dear Paul. Mr. Dupré. Would you care to stay with me a while longer? With pleasure. Madeleine.
