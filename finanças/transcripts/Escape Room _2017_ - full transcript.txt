Subtitles by explosiveskull Fuck! Okay, I've got ten numbers, four spots. I need a four-digit code. No, no, no. Shit! What now? Shit. Jesus Christ. Clues. Shit. Okay. That's nothing. "Follow the light to greener pastures." What does that mean? What does that mean? Light? What light? Light. Follow the light. Green. Green book, yeah. Greener pastures. Okay. Yeah, all right. Oh! "At any point in history, to watch another die, unveils time's great mystery, while leaving you alive." Time. Time. Some kind of clock. Shit. Where's the clock? I don't see a goddamn clock! "To watch another person die." Yeah. Okay, yeah. "To watch another person die." Oh, shit! Okay. They're pointing! Let's see. It's time. It's hands on a clock. Yeah. That one's four! Four o'clock! Eight. Six! Two! That's the number, that's the code! Okay. Where's the four? Shit. Come on. All right. Okay. Yeah, good. Come on, come on! Eight! Six. Oh, my God. Where's the...? Six, six, six! Oh, God! Two, two! Yeah. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on! Why isn't it working? Oh, shit. Come on. Open! Come on, open! Oh, God, there's no way out! Please get me out! Shit! No! No! Has anyone ever heard the saying, "A watched pot never boils"? Well, on a quantum scale, that may actually be true. Does anyone know what the quantum Zeno effect is? Wow, guys, not all at once now. Well, it may well be one of the oddest things in quantum physics. Simply put, observation stops movement. Atoms won't change while you watch them. All right, that's all the time we have. Have a good holiday. See you after the break. Happy Thanksgiving. Zoey, can I talk to you for a minute? I read your paper on the quantum Zeno effect. So, you want to be heard. You want to share what you know, but only in the safety of your own dorm room? I'll try and speak up more. It might seem like reducing the number of variables in your life will control the outcome, but life isn't a science experiment. You can't contain your world forever. Try doing one thing that scares you over break, okay? Okay. Ray, it's Jason. Listen. You want to buy a boat by retirement, right? Well, keep focusing on these low-beta stocks, and it's going to be a rowboat with rented oars. By the end of the first quarter, the market's going to see a 10-percent return, while you'll be sailing away with 30. Uh-huh. Hey, you won't regret it. I must be like the Mr. Miyagi of trading to you, Charlie. "Mr...?" Jesus Christ, kid, what year were you born? He's this wise, old Japanese man who taught a kid karate so he could beat up other kids. Mr. Ackerman for you on line one. 100 bucks says I'm getting a gift. Congratulations, Mr. Ackerman. Are you celebrating? Well, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ackerman. No. No, no, no, I couldn't accept a gift. Uh-huh. A private jet. To Tahiti? Wow. Your home there. Uh-huh. Heh. Now, that sounds like a hell of a weekend. Man who catch fly with chopstick... accomplish anything. You, beginner luck. Wax on, wax off. Hey, Gary. I, uh... I heard there was... an opening up front at checkout. I could use the bump. I'm trying to move out of my mom's. It's starting to cramp her style. Look, I feel for you, kid. I really do. You know, I do. It's just putting you out front would be bad for business. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not cut out for customer service shit anyhow, so... Ben... you've got to find healthier ways to unwind. Go outside, make a friend. - I didn't mean to... - It's fine, it's fine. Sorry. Yeah. Thanks, Gary. A messenger dropped this off for you. It's from Mr. Ackerman. Of course it is. This better be keys to a Tesla. "For always thinking outside the box." Well, it seems like Mr. Ackerman has graduated from sending single malts to boxes that don't open. Yeah. Rich people are weird. Money can't buy you happiness. You better afford your own brand of misery, Charlie. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Whatever. I'll be in tomorrow. ♪ They say sleep Is the cousin of death ♪ Hey, offer still stands. Are you sure you don't want to come to my family's for Thanksgiving? Thank you, but, you know, big family dinners aren't really my thing. Okay. You know, I'm really psyched about having time to myself. I've been wanting to take a stab at one of those cuboid conjectures for, like, forever. It's really cool, actually. They claim irreducibility of three univariate polynomials with integer coefficients and if that is true, then Euler's concept of a perfect box can't exist. Wow. You know, sometimes I wonder if you just make up words because you know I won't Google them. Not again. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. Well, I'm out of here. Okay. Hey, this is for you. It's from your professor. - Oh. - Wait. You guys aren't doing it, are you? What? No. Well, have fun playing with your... box. Bye, Allison. Bye. "Open new doors." "A chance to escape." Remember, the puzzle box is intuitive. You don't want to force it. Snap, crackle, and... Heh. I hate you. Give this to the guy that failed eighth grade math. Great idea, Gary. This is the biggest waste of... "This serves as an entry voucher for Minos Escape Rooms." "Be the first to escape our most immersive rooms yet and win $10,000." Hi. This is the Minos building? - I think so. - Thanks. Yeah, it's going to kill me, I know. Hi. Yeah. I'm here for the escape room. ID please. Thanks. - Most guys buy me dinner first. - I need to collect your phone. Really? Why? You can't be Twittering pictures of the puzzles. - Okay. - Third floor. Okay, thanks. Thank you for your service. Hold the door, please. I always sneak in a second one. - The waiting rooms can get so boring. - Mm. Yes! Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly. Okay, thanks. Quite the welcome wagon, isn't she? Super friendly. Heh. - Hey, Michael. Mike. - Amanda. - Your name's Amanda? - Yeah. - Isn't that funny? - What? I had a family dog growing up named Amanda. She was a cute, little husky-collie. Two different colored eyes, actually. It was very unique. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, she was cool. Yeah, and then she died. You know, dogs die. Hitchhiking accident. Can you still play video games? No. No, man. Unfortunately I can't, so I just have sex with adult women to fill the time. - Heh. Okay. - Yeah. Uh... Sorry. Hi. - Hi. - Do I know you? No, I don't think so. Really? You look really familiar to me. You're not on TV or something, are you? Well, this is going to suck. Hi. Hey. Sign-in sheet? Yeah, don't bother. She's preoccupied. How are you doing? Mike. - Ben. - Ben. I'm guessing you got a box too, huh? Yeah. Did it take you long to open it? It didn't take me too long. Yeah, we all got boxes. Opening it was the easy part. So, the website for this place made the games look pretty fun, huh? Yeah. They're basically like real-life video games. - Really? - So, you've done one of these before. I've done 93 rooms. Yeah, all the big ones. Panic Room, Enigma, Basement... Breakout, Break In, Lock In. Lock Down, of course. I've done all the bunkers: World War One, World War Two... Cold War, Cold War Two: Pol Pot's Revenge. Uh... What about you guys? You must be really good at these, huh? Yeah. I'm pretty good. It's not cool. Yeah. You know, my nephew's like you. He's completely obsessed. He burns through all of his allowance money on escape rooms. He's the reason why I'm here. He signed me up. And apparently this room was rated one of the top in the country on some chat room. Yeah. My weirdo rich client gave this to me as a gift. It felt mandatory. Yeah, paying people to lock me in a room never seemed too appealing to me. Yeah? What changed your mind? - Ha, ha. Uh...$10,000. - Yeah, me too. That is a big chunk of change in my book, you know? Yeah. I've been driving an 18-wheeler since I had this injury a while back, and I've been reading about these self-driving cars. And I heard that the trucking industry's going to be the first one to get automated, so I'm trying to just squirrel away a few nuts before the robots come to get me. - That was a real buzzkill, man. - It's just my life. This one's got to be really insane for there to be a cash prize. The website said no one's been able to escape it yet. If we're able to do that, we're going to have so much street cred. You have no idea. Are there rules and regulations? What? You just have to escape before the clock runs out. Well, what happens if you don't? Some guy comes in through the door and explains all the clues you missed. He makes you feel like a total idiot. When does the game start? We are waiting for the Games Master to come in to give us the story and take us to the escape room. Like, it's a zombie apocalypse and we have to find the cure before we get eaten alive. I like that one. That one sounds good. While the Games Master is looking for a parking spot, I'm going to go smoke a cigarette. Oh. Shit. Um... Hey, the doorknob came off. - What, you broke it? - Of course he did. I didn't break it, it broke. Is that how you open a door in your house? - No. - Well, don't be so rough with it. Well, excuse me, miss. Ma'am. Oh, my God, this is awesome. You guys, you guys, I think this is the escape room. What? Wait, what? Okay, it looks like an oven dial, which means it's probably a combination lock. All right, everyone search the room. Wait, wait. It's starting right now? - Yes. - Oh! What are we looking for here, bud? Anything that looks like a puzzle or a code. Numbers are very important. It could be anything, anywhere. Maybe under here. Do you want me to hold on to this or is it...? Yeah, just hold your knob there, guy. Great. Very funny. Yeah. Hey, guys. Hey, guys, these are all addressed to the same guy, this Dr. Wootan Yu. I mean, that's got to be a clue, right? Maybe that's the story. Maybe he's like an evil scientist and we have to escape his lab before he sews us all together into some sort of medical abomination. So, his evil lab has a waiting room? - Yeah. - No. Shit. Shit, shit. Guys, look, look. I found a star-head screwdriver. That's got to be something, right? Great. So, we're looking for screws? Well, this isn't a hammer. - That's a star-head, right? - I think so. Yeah. That's Fahrenheit 451. Oh. All right, she's got something. - What was that? - I don't know. Did that do anything? Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Okay. - All right, now that's pretty cool. - Yeah. Anybody got suntan lotion? What did you just do? I just thought the book was the code for the oven dial. Turn it off, please. Wow, it's really throwing off some heat. Yeah, it's warm. It's kicking some heat. What are those, giant oven coils? - Turn it off. - I'm sorry. It's stuck. I can't move it. - Shit. - This is crazy hot. - Can you shut it off? - Shit. Okay. Don't touch anything else, okay? Hey, you, gamer boy, there. What do we do? How do we get out of here? When you're stuck, you can ask for a hint. A hint? That's an option? Okay, great. Here we go. Yeah, but it's way more fun if we do it ourselves. Good one, gamer boy. I kind of want to do it ourselves. Hi, excuse me. - We'd like our hint now, please. - Yeah, hello. Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly. No, yeah, excuse me, we'd really like our hint, please. Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly. - She said that last time. - So? She said it the exact same way. Same cadence, same tone. Well, the actors they hire aren't exactly Dame Judi Dench. - Hello? Hello? - I love Judi Dench. Yeah, I don't think the snow globe's going to help, man. Hey. Uh... Hey, guys, there's a lock over here. Yes. Locks are a super important part of escape rooms. All right. Okay, it looks like we need a small key to get to the other side of the partition. That's probably where the next clue is. Well, I'm not going to be any help there because I can never find my keys. Hilarious. Or we could just break it off. There's an extinguisher right here. Yeah, good idea. No, no. We shouldn't have to use force. That's actually the one rule I forgot to tell you. My bad. - Good one. - Great. You're really good at breaking stuff, huh? It's plastic. What was that? That's that same sound, right? Man, what the hell did you just do? Oh! Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, that looks real. They're just trying to give us a scare as part of the immersive experience. What the hell, are they paying you? No, I just know how to have fun, I guess. Heat stroke is your idea of fun? It's getting warm. Hey, it's not that bad. Just take off your jacket. Hey, does anyone else have a problem with this? Hey, guys, I think I've got the key. Whoa, hey, there. Listen, short stuff... let's talk about this before you bring tiki torches - out of the walls, okay? - Hold on now. She's got a key. Why don't we stick it in the keyhole? Okay, yeah. My bad. Let's try it. Give it a shot, come on. Please have a seat. Someone will be with you shortly. Well, that's creepy as hell. Fine. Yeah. I'll get it. Move. Hello. Welcome to Minos, the world's preeminent designer of escape rooms. To get the most out of your game, we recommend following all posted rules. Hey. Hey. Hello? Hello? Who was it? What did they say? It was a recording. It said to follow all the posted rules. What posted rules? Oh, shit. - No. - Did I do that? No, no. What the literal hell? Please stop. Okay, I'm done. No, no. You're stressing everyone out here, okay? Just go get some water and take off your damn jacket. We've got to find a way out of this Easy-Bake Oven. Okay, look at me, look at me. Amanda. Oh, shit. Are those fans? Are they blowing hot air? We'll just get some water, okay? Come and get some water with me. I'm fine. Okay. Yeah, it's getting hot, but nothing is going to happen to us. - Ovens have fans. - True, but so what? We've got to find the posted rules. I don't care about the posted rules. It might be colder by the windows. I'm burning up. Come on, how do we get out of here? You're not going to solve anything by sitting on your ass. I'm not sitting on my ass. I'm on my hands and knees. Hey, what are you three doing? Look for something, come on. It's too hot. What do you want me to do? Ladies, come on, enough with the water. Get over here and help us look. We just have to figure out what the clue meant. Hold on. What's this? There's no way this is part of the game. Where are all the clues at, huh? Ah! Guys, come on. It's getting hot in here. We've got to find something to break this door open. Dude, we're not supposed to use force. Come on! When is this over? How do we get out? It's getting hotter. We're being baked alive. Guys, relax. This is sick. Who does this? Come on, Ben. What do you want me to do? I can't see anything. Guys, we need to focus and find the clues. It's like 150 degrees in here. Hey. Hey, Zoey, the painting. Oh, my God. There's an exit. Oh, hot dog, look at that. Zoey, do that again. Whatever you did, just do it again. Hey, guys, it's a duct. It could be a way out. Guys, there are more coasters here. Get on the coasters. Everyone try pressing down at the same time. God, even the table's hot. - Is that it? Did we win the game? - Yeah. - I'll go first. - All right, we win the game. Whoa, whoa. Wait, you're not going to just leave us with our dicks in our hands. Does anybody prefer this guy go instead of me? - That's what I thought. - Really? Where does it go? - How deep does it go? - It goes pretty far. Jesus Christ. It's broiling. It's not getting any cooler in here. Oh, my God. I'm so excited for the next room. - The next room? - Jason? Hey, I think I found a way out! It's blocked by a grate. - Mike, bring that screwdriver. - Yeah! It's in my pocket. Someone get it out of my pocket for me. Come here, Amanda. Does anybody want to take the screwdriver? - I've got it, I've got it. Go. - Are you sure? Yeah. Go, go. - Just do it. - You've got this, Mike. Go, man. It's not getting any colder. Hurry up, go. - Mike, where you at? - I'm coming. Hey, hey. Just think of it like interactive dinner theater. Jesus Christ, you're not helping me here, man. Okay, yeah. I'm making it worse. My bad. Are you going to come today or what? - Watch your face down there. - You watch your face up there. Come on. Come on, come on. Hey, I got it. You guys, come on! Do you want to go? Amanda, you should go. Okay. Okay, here, take these. Okay. He can take that. I'll hold it. - Okay. - All right, come on. You've got this. All right. I feel like we're avoiding the inevitable conclusion here. We're running out of hands. I've got an idea. Come here. Put your foot on here, please. - Ow. Ow. Ow. - Okay. This is the worst game of Twister ever. Can we move a little faster, please? - It didn't work. - Shit. Okay, maybe it needs to be full. - I think I'm going to pass out. - Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Come on! You can move your foot. Okay. - It worked! - Yes, yes. Amanda? Hey, why don't you just go help her? We'll fill the glasses. Stop being chivalrous, dude. No one here wants to have sex with you. - Go! - Okay. Nice. Really nice, Ben. Shit. - Come on. - Okay. She's clear. Go, go, go. Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch, please. Come on, come on, come on. Amanda? Amanda, I'm here. Okay. Good. What's wrong? You can breathe. You're not stuck. Breathe in with me. One, two... Two more. This is not real. You're not stuck. You're okay. I'm here, okay? I'm holding your hand. I promise I'm right here. You're okay. Okay, we need one more. We just need one more. Shit, we're out of water. What are we supposed to do now? How would I know? You're the expert here. We're really close. We're really close, I promise. This is all your fault, you know. - What? - You're the reason that Amanda drank all of our clues. Jason's right there, okay? How was I supposed to know that the water cooler was... Oh, no. - Well, that's not good. - What the fuck? My flask. My flask. You've had that the whole time? Oh, my God. Come on! Yes. Yes. Do you want to burn to death? Let's go! What the hell? Oh, Jesus. Talk about immersive. Immersive? What the hell is wrong with you? That was real! - They're just messing with us. - Are you kidding me, dude? Look, it went off right as I cleared it. Okay, I must have triggered it. The Games Master wants us to think we barely made it. I can't be the only one. Hey. It's ten grand and I don't lose. Well, I'm out, okay? Hi. Okay, I'm done. I want out. You let me out of here now! You think they're watching us right now? - Come on. - "Sai-San lock and co." All right, so we need another key. Give me your phone. I'm calling the cops. Think about it for a second, okay? What has actually happened to us so far? Nothing. What will you tell the cops? I don't know, maybe that they locked us in a giant oven and tried to cook us. Is open flame a common occurrence in these things? - Not really. - Not really. Give me your goddamn phone. You do have a phone. How did you get a phone in here? I snuck it in. - There's no signal. - Typical. Well, yeah. We're in a giant concrete building. Guys, we can figure this out. I mean, look at this place. I mean, the only thing missing is the hot chocolate. All right, how long do you think this game is going to last? I mean, I don't know. I did one that had, like, five rooms once. Five? Five rooms? Okay. Okay. So, that means we just need to do that four more times. I'm kidding. Come on, guys, we can do this. That was the hardest room by far, right? They front-loaded it, right, Danny? Yeah. I mean, I'm sure they can't afford to light every room on fire. Exactly. Look at it. This place is a goddamn tinder box. Hey. Hey, second lock, guys. It looks like we need a seven-letter word. Let's spread out and see what we can find. Okay. "You'll go down in history." What about this? Could that mean something? "You'll go down in history." You'll go down in history. You'll go down in history. Maybe a president's name? Maybe a president's last name. What presidents have a seven-letter last name? Madison, Jackson. Lincoln, Johnson, Harding. - Whoa. Slow down there, Rain Man. - That's offensive. What was the first one? Madison. M-A-D-I- -S-O-N. No, that didn't work. What was another one? - Johnson. - Johnson. Okay, Johnson. J-O-H-N-S-O-N. No, what else? Yeah, Jackson. J-A-C-K-S-O-N. What's the next name? - Try Lincoln. Lincoln. - Lincoln? L-I-N-C-O-L-N. There are letters here, but there are nine. No, that doesn't work either. ♪ How the reindeer Loved him ♪ ♪ As they shouted out With glee ♪ ♪ Rudolph The red-nosed reindeer ♪ ♪ You'll go down in history ♪ Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen... Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. - You'll go down in history. - What is he talking about? - It's "Rudolph." - Did he say "Rudolph"? - Yeah, try "Rudolph." - All right, "Rudolph" it is. Bingo! Look at that. Hey, he helps. All right. Hey, see? It's going to be fine from now on. No more scary shit. Hey... are you okay? Yeah, fine. Look at this, going from hot to cold. You know, that's how you get sick. Whoa. Dumb question. Are we outside... or am I stone-cold tripping? I don't know, man. This place is really cold. It's 30 degrees and dropping. Real fun game, huh? - Echo! - Hey. This whole place is bullshit. The sooner we figure this out, the sooner we get the hell of out here. This is beautiful. Oh, man, I could hang out in here for a while. It's like ice skating. - Into the great wide open, Danny! - Be careful. Keep going, man. Check it out. - Yeah, where are you going? - Let him figure it out. Whoa! - Guys? - Hey, nobody move. Come on, guys. Relax, okay? It's fine. Look. Hey, don't do that. It's just a sound effect. The ice isn't cracking. They are watching to make sure nothing bad happens to us. I mean, can you imagine the lawsuits if one of us actually got hurt? Learn to have some fun in your life. Jeez. Whoever did this is an artist. What is that? - Danny, come on back. - Get over here. Hurry up, Danny. Shit. There's freezing air coming through those vents. Come on, Danny! Danny, get back here. Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Shit, that is cold. - Get together for body heat. - Oh, the air is freezing. - Stay close. - This is awesome. - Why are they doing this? - Come on, get closer. - Oh, my God, that's cold. We should look for clues. Hello? Hey. Open, open, open. Hey. - Yeah, do you want to look? - Yeah. "True north is a lie." What are you looking at? Good boy. Hey, I found a door. We need a small key. Where did that come from? One coat for six people? You know what they're trying to do, right? They want us to fight over limited resources. Jesus Christ. Hey. Hey, assholes. It's not going to work this time, okay? We're going to share it. Zoey, you go first. Thank you. - Shit, that's cold. - Ben. Shit! Oh, that's cold. Hey, false alarm, everybody. A giant fishing hole. How did you miss that? What are we supposed to do with this? There could be a clue at the bottom. Oh, really? Why don't you go dive in and check? Okay, it just feels like I'm playing the world's funnest game with the world's meanest people. I can't feel my goddamn leg. - Hey, guys. - Mike? Ha! Look, I've got it. I mean, I've got something. I just climbed a tree for, like, the first time in my goddamn life. Danny, tell me this is something we can use. Yeah, totally. It's a clue. Finally, something I'm good at. You mean you can stand over a hole and hold a stick? Wow, thank God you're here. I understand you're cold right now, but if you say something disrespectful to me like that again... I'm going to give you the slap your parents should have years ago. - Oh, really? - That's amazing. With pleasure. So, what are we supposed to do now, just stand here and wait to catch a clue? Well, it's probably really deep. Yeah, I'm about 20 feet down already. I can't even see. This is a waste of time. You think this is a waste of time? - Yeah. - It's so goddamn cold. I do. I think it's a distraction. I think this whole thing is a waste of time. I climbed up to the top of that tree. I found a fishing rod up there. True north. What? What are you trying to tell me? True north is a lie. They're probably watching us, laughing their asses off, as we stand around a hole like a bunch of morons. - We probably just have to wait. - Oh, screw that, man. Give me this, Mike. Mike, give me the pole! Why don't you chill out, man? You don't know what you're doing, man. You don't even have the release open. Don't let it out. You've got to drop it to the bottom. Shit, that's deep. Screw this. Here, take this. Give me that back. I'm sorry, all right? I hate the cold and it makes me go crazy. I have to spend every winter in Kauai. Me, too. When I'm not in the South of France. Hey, where's Zoey with that jacket? I need that jacket. Yes. Hey, you mind not smoking that around me? Pull up the line. I found something. - Pull up the line. - What? Everyone, I found something. What do you got there? Another clue? Impressive, Zoey. - What is it? - Okay. - A magnet, of course. - I'm with you. Okay, okay. Okay, try it. Try it now. All right, all right. Stand back. There she goes. Zoey, your turn is up. Right. Sorry. Oh, shit. Okay. I'm on the bottom. No, I'm hooked. All right, I've got something. I've got something here. Yeah, I'm definitely hooked. Oh, God. - Nice. - God, that's heavy. Okay. Okay, I've got it. I've got it. You've got it? We've got a key or something. You've got it. Okay. That's got to be the key to the door. - Who thinks of this shit? - One, two, three. Okay. One, two, three. - Okay. - Shit, that is solid. - Hey, Ben. We need your lighter. - Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. What do I get in return? I won't take any of your One Direction CDs. Come on, just give it, man. All right, you want the lighter? Here. There you go. - Okay, I'll get it. - Thanks, Danny. I don't know. Man, that is buried right in the center, isn't it? Oh, and you're welcome, by the way. Thanks a lot. Danny? What was that? What happened? Where's Danny? Say something. Where is he? He just fell through. What do you mean, he fell through? He's under the ice! Danny! Danny! Danny! All right, I'm going in after him. No, no. There is a current under there. Even if you find him, you will not make it back to the hole. Danny, where are you? He's being dragged around under there. Danny! Danny, where are you? - Danny! Where did he go? - Do you see him? - I can't see him. - Danny! Shush, shush, shush! Shush! - Oh, my God. Danny. - Where is he? Danny. Danny, Danny. What happened? You were right. This is real. How did it happen? Hey! - How did it happen? - What? How did Danny fall in? You're the only one who saw. He was there and then it exploded and then he fell. You threw him the lighter and somehow you're perfectly fine? I threw it across the ice. I was just being an asshole. Yeah, you threw it to the exact spot that just happened to collapse? Are you saying that I did it? Yeah, hey, your words, not mine. Danny kept talking about a Games Master. Yeah. Well, maybe he's already here. Games Master? I work at a grocery store, all right? I mean, Jason's the one here with the whole American Psycho vibe. Mike, you're like the creep at the truck stop. And Zoey, I'm really sorry, but it seems like your parents locked you in a basement until you finished all your homework. And her. What about her? I mean, where did she get all the scars? I served in Iraq, asshole. Oh, so you've had military experience? So, that makes you like a... psycho Xena. I'm just saying here, I'm, like, the least suspicious one. Okay, you know what? Shut up! None of it matters, all right? Whoever did this to us will let us freeze to death, if we don't get the key out of that ice. Okay. Since Ben's lighter is gone, we have to surround it with as much body heat as possible. Ben's lighter is gone? Danny is dead. Do you know what happens when you get hypothermia? Huh? You get disoriented and confused. And I don't care how smart you are or how many books you read, you won't remember how you got here, much less how to get out. You guys get over here and put your hands on this ice. I know it's cold, but it's melting, guys. Come on, just keep your hands on it. Hey, jacket. Let me take it for a minute. Oh, that's cold. Okay. Here. Jesus. How are you doing there, Mike? - Oh, you know. - Need a break? Mm-mm. No, I got it. I'm okay. I'm okay. Thank you. I just can't figure it out. Who would do this? Someone who thought of every detail. - Mike? - Hey, Mike. Hey, put your back against the tree. - No, I'm okay. - We're here, okay? Hey, we're here, we're here. - Jason? - Where's he going? He's got the key. You guys, come on. - Get up, come on. - Okay. - Where is it at? - Hey, Jason. Where's it at? Where's the door? - Jason! - Get off me! Where's the door? There's a door? Open it. Open the goddamn door! Open up! Open this door! Open the goddamn door! Hey, you did it, you opened a door. - Move. - Jason! Let's go! Wait. Oh, shit! - Wait, wait. - Zoey, come on! Wait for me! Ben! Hey, is everyone okay? I can't feel my extremities. What is that? Uh-huh. Sure, why not? Well... glass half full, at least it's warm in here. Oh, my God. What's happening? What is that? - Are we moving? - Yeah. Hold on. - What, are we going up? - Yeah. How many floors is this building? 15 to 20 floors. Well, I'm guessing they didn't shoot us up here for the view. Okay. How are we supposed to answer that? Hello? Son of a bitch! God, that's loud. And it sucks. Oh, great, we're going to die to elevator music. Guys, hey, this door up here doesn't have a handle. I think we're looking for a doorknob. Let's see what we can find. ♪ Listen to the music Of the traffic in the city ♪ ♪ Linger on the sidewalk The neon signs are pretty ♪ ♪ How can you lose The lights are much... ♪ Hey, the eight ball, it's missing from the pool table. Look at that. I'm going to check these cue racks. Maybe there's something over here we can use. - Hey. Mike, stop! - Mike! Mike! Get away from the edge. Grab onto something. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Mike, step back! Mike! - Guys, come on. - Hey, get off the floor! Mike, hurry up! Mike, get off the floor. - Shit. - Did you see that? What the hell's going on? What is this, like, musical chairs? What do we do now? I don't know, try not to die. Hey, Amanda, just think about this. Just let me try this. Go, go, go. - Oh, shit. - Are you okay? Yeah, it's just wet. Oh, shit. Okay, here I go. Hey, what about the radio? Maybe it'll shut the music off. No, I don't think it's connected. What about those coolers at the top? Okay. Maybe the handle's in there. And keep your eyes peeled for that eight ball. Okay. Yeah, the craftsmanship in here is just terrifying. I hate this room so much. Guys, I've got a lock box. All right. It looks like I need four numbers. All right, try one-two-three-four. Just to see. I guess we know Mike's PIN code. Nope. All right. Try one-one-one-one. You know, go back to the basics. What? One-one-one-one? Uh, nope. That's not it. It's a giant sliding puzzle. - Zo? - Zoey? - Zoey, what are you doing? - Zo? Careful. Careful, careful, careful. Good job, Zo. That's good, Zoey. Just stay there. Where are you going? I can't hang around on this bookshelf all day. This was a bad idea. Oh, God. Come on. One, two, three. Up you get. Thanks. Okay. Oh, shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, shit. Jason, hold on! I'm okay. I'm okay. Oh, God. I'm okay. Oh, God. Are you all right? Keep going. Keep going. I'm okay. He's okay. It's okay, he's okay. You've got this. You've got this. Is there anything we can do about this shitty music? Oh, God! Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. Hey, I've got it. What? Got it. There are colors. I see yellow... black, and blue. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and we've got two lines and a circle. It's like Morse code. Maybe it's Morse code. Stripes and circles. They're billiard balls. The yellow stripe, that's a nine. Nine. Next. The black ball, like, that's the eight ball, obviously. - Eight. Two more. - Blue stripe, that's ten. Try one-zero. One-zero. Goddamn it. - Shit. - Shit! - Go, go, go. - Get off the floor. You've got it, Mike. Come on. Oh, my God. Hold on, okay? That thing's not going to hold all three of you. - Mike, climb off. - And go where? - Use that rack on your right. - Here, here. Guys, just hang on, okay? Oh, shit, I can't. I can't. Mike, look at me. Get off the goddamn shelf before you get everybody killed. Mike, man up. Stop yelling at him, okay? Stop. Mike, I'll move. I can move, okay? Just stay there. Just stay there. Don't worry about it. Just go, go. Zoey. Hey, give me your hand. Come on, give me your hand. - Zoey, hey. Come on. - Careful. Come on, give me your hand. Zoey. Zoey! Zoey. Hey, Zoey. Oh, God! - Goddamn it! - Zoey! You've got to get up. Come on. Zoey, wake up. Zoey, get off the floor. Zoey, stay with me. Hey, you guys come on, I'll go get her. Come in, Vietnam Air 109. Come in, Vietnam Air 109. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mama. Mom! Zoey, come on, wake up. Zoey, wake up. Zoey, come on. We've got to go. Zoey, come on! We're upside down. Hey. Come on, come on. Hey, go, go. The room is upside down, so the code might be, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Try zero-one-eight-six. Zero-one-eight-six. - I've got it. - Okay, we've got it. Come on. - Zoey, you're a genius. - Come on, hurry up. Come on, Ben, hurry up. Hurry up. - Come on. Hurry up. - Okay. Come on, the floor's going to drop. That is the second time this floor has tried to kill me. Shit. Come on, Jason. I've got it. Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Amanda, be careful. Hang on. Hang on. All right, you've got this. Yes. Yes. - All right. - No, don't look down. Okay. Okay. You've got it. You've got it. Okay. Come on. Come on. - Okay. - Shit. Oh, no. Okay. - The ball! - No! Just let it go! - Just leave it. - Hey, stop, stop! - Just leave it. - Amanda! No! Oh, shit! Jason! - I got it. The cord! - Jump! Hey, give me the pool cue. Yeah, good idea. Hang on. Hang on, Amanda. Hang on. Come on, reach out there. - Grab on to this, come on! - Grab it. I can't get it any farther. Hey, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it, Amanda. You can do this. Just grab it, okay? Grab on to it! Come on, you got this. It's just right there. Amanda, listen to me. You can do it. You can do this. We're right here. Okay? Stay. No. It's okay. Amanda! No, stay, okay? Just hold on, just hold on. No! No! No, no, no! No, no! No, Amanda, no, no! Zoey, come on. Hey, come on. Get out! No. What in the hell is this supposed to be? I don't see a way out. Do you see anything? Hey, wunderkind, I need your brain. Get in here. Zoey! Will you give her a minute? Amanda just died! What don't you people understand? We don't have minutes to waste. Amanda is dead. We aren't. Survival of the fittest. Will you stop being a dick? What is your problem? Amanda wasn't weak, okay? She sacrificed herself for us! Okay, well, then let's not waste that sacrifice by getting yourself killed. This was my room. Exactly the same. This is my bed. Me, too. It's Amanda's. IED blast. She was the only survivor. I was on a plane with my mom... backpacking across Vietnam. The plane just crashed in the middle of the jungle. It took them a week to find me. I remember that. You were on the news. My college roommate and I took a boat out... and a wave came out of nowhere and just... flipped the boat over. And I tried to grab a line and, uh... almost took my thumb off. Wet... freezing, just holding on to the hull... with only one jacket between the two of us. And Nathan, he started getting aggressive and confused. It was signs of hypothermia, they told me later in the hospital. Nathan, come back! On the second day, he swam off. I don't know what he thought he saw out there... but there was nothing but ocean. The next day, the Coast Guard found me alone. What about you? I was the first of my friends to get a car. It was winter break and we were having this... great night and... I wanted to take everybody out on a joy ride. I was wasted. Me and 11 others were working a mine in West Virginia... including my little brother, Cal. There was a cave-in. Occupational hazard. Me and Cal got pinned right next to each other. I couldn't see him, but I could, uh... I could hear him suffocating slowly. I heard him take his last breath. By the time the rescue crew got there, I was the only one alive. They knew everything about us... every goddamn detail. I mean, they knew the jacket... that my roommate was wearing on that boat. "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," that's the... song that was playing when we crashed. They made these rooms for us. They addressed the boxes from people that we trust. My nephew texted me, "Have a good time." - They hacked his goddamn phone. - It's Danny's. Carbon monoxide poisoning. Everyone in his family was killed but him. None of us died, right? - We're sole survivors. - So what? We're a statistical improbability. And now they want to see who will be the luckiest among the lucky. Do you have the heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu... help you become a better you? Open new doors by testing your limits. Don't settle for a humdrum existence. Live life to the extreme. Place your order in the next five minutes and receive a complimentary getaway. Okay, well, at least we know how much time we have. Yeah, knowing exactly when I'm going to die is a huge comfort. Do you guys not understand? They chose us to die to see who's the last person standing. We need you on board right now, okay? Stay with us. We can't just keep playing by their rules. What else are we supposed to do? They're watching us. They know every move that we're making. They're watching us. I've got something. Come on, come on. I got it. Here, here. Uh. Okay. What do we have? A fist, one finger, and two fingers. It could be... It could be zero, one, two, right? Right? Like a code. No, no, no. It spells... E-K-G. Yeah, it's sign language. My cousin is deaf. They must have known about that, too. Is there an EKG machine here somewhere? Hey, what are you doing? Quantum Zeno effect. Atoms won't change if you take continuous measurements... so as long as they're watching us, we can't change our state. The game is designed so they always win. Okay, okay. We could really use your help right now. No. We can find another way out. We don't even know the first way out. Just stop smashing shit and take a deep breath. Do you have the heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu help you become a better you? Hey, Zoey, you need to calm down. In three minutes, they're going to poison us. We are running out of time here. You've got to calm down. Stop telling me to calm down, okay? You're not listening to me! You guys, it's an EKG machine. Maybe this is our way out. - Ben, take your shirt off. - What? Why me? Because it's the next clue, that's why. Come on, it's just an EKG machine. No, no. Nothing is just anything in this hellhole. The right heart rate could open a door, Ben. - We're running out of time. - Hurry up. Just do it. Come on. Come on. Hold those, hold those. Take a breath, take a breath. Your heart rate's too low. Your heart rate's too low. It's not working. Somebody else has to do it. Mike, we need a higher rate. You've got to go. What? I'm not your guinea pig, man. You do it. You try it. Look. Ben is fine, man. Come on, I'll go next. We need a higher rate. Come on. All right. Okay. All right, let's do it. Zoey, please, just listen to me for two seconds. Shit. We're in a metal box. Come on, that's not going to help. Just stop smashing shit and help me. Higher, higher, higher. Come on! No. Open new doors by testing your limits. Testing your limits. Testing your limits. - We need a higher rate. - You're kidding me. Man, I'm already freaking out here. My heart rate's sky high. Want me to do some burpees, jumping jacks? What do you want me to do? - We've got these. - What are you, insane? When the Coast Guard found me dying from hypothermia... my heart was half dead, man. These are what they used to bring me back. Come on, this is what they used. No, no. That is not an option. Listen, it is a clue. They put it in my room because they knew I would know, Mike. Your heart's already high. Man up, come on. Are you kidding me? Get these away from me. Look at me, goddamn it! Look at me! In one minute, they're about to poison us. And we are going to suffocate, all right? We're going to run out of breathable air, just like you did in that mine. Shit. You think about your brother, Cal. Cal was his name, right? This is your time. Mike, you can save us. This is it. You could save us, Mike. - Now, save us. - Okay. Do it. Do it, do it quick! Come on, do it! - Jason, what are you doing? - That's it. No. No. - Hey, don't. Stop! - Get off me! You're going to kill him! Come on! Mike? What did you do? He stopped breathing! Mike! Wake up! Mike. Hey, stop! Stop! Come on! Come on, Mike! Open new doors by testing your limits. Testing your limits. High and low. High and low. One, two. Goddamn it. Fuck! Oh, shit. I don't actually know how to do this. What the hell are you doing? Extremes. Maybe they mean the low end. Hey, come on. Come on, man. Come on. Shit. Mike. Mike. The door. The door is opening. It opened. Zoey. Hey! Zoey! Zoey! Hey, come on. There's a way out. This is the way out. You'll suffocate, come on! Just go! - Please! - Just go! Shit. We should have made her come with us. We just left her there to die. She made her decision. What the hell is wrong with you? What happened back there? I saved our asses. You're welcome. You killed Mike. Sitting on his ass 12 hours a day killed him. If it wasn't that room, it would've been the next. So that's just something you do, isn't it? Your friend on the boat? What are you saying, Ben? Huh? Use your words. One jacket between the two of you. Give me your jacket! It's pretty convenient that he just swam off and died. You don't want to do this, man. You being the sole survivor had nothing to do with luck. Admit it. You killed him! Admit that you killed your friend. Surviving is a choice! Make yours. Keep your eyes open and look for clues. Hey, it's a hatch. I guess we just open it. What are we letting in? Fine, I'll do it. - It's heavy. - Come on, try harder. Asshole, I don't go to the gym every day. Goddamn it. Come on, come on. What's this shit on my hands? I don't feel so good. Hey, hey. They put something on the handle. Hey, you're melting. You're melting. - What? - You're melting. What? Wait. Look, look. It says something. "Feel free to leave, but may we note... it's best to find the antidote." How the hell are we supposed to do that? Get up and look, goddamn it! Who cares, man? We're going to die here anyway. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. Okay. Where is it? Come on. Come on. Where is it? - Where is this bastard? - Where is it? Ben. Ben. - I have the anti... - Give me that! It's mine! Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Okay, I've got ten numbers, four spots. I need a four-digit code. Entering room five. Stand by. Standing by. We have two bodies. Over. Copy. 20 minutes for disposal and cleanup. Over. Copy. Out. Look at that, the oxygen mask. What the hell was she going to do with that? Breathe, bitch! Shit. Now, you were a dark horse. My money was on Jason. But, see, that's why these games are so fascinating. Somehow, after being burnt, frozen, poisoned, and crippled... you still managed to escape the final room. Did you ever think you had that in you? That adrenaline, that drive? Sit down. Celebrate. You won something for once. So, you're the psycho that designed this murder maze, huh? No, I'm the Games Master. The Puzzle Maker designs the rooms. But you kill people for fun. There's nothing good left on TV? You killed all your friends... because you didn't want to pay for a goddamn cab. I wouldn't get too comfortable on that high horse, Ben. From the beginning of civilization... we've known there was something captivating... about watching human beings fight for their lives. That's why we watch gladiator games, public executions... rubber-necking on the freeway. But now the world's gone soft. Everything is safe. Everything is careful. So, we created a sport for people who still have a thirst for savagery... and we provided them with a box seat for life's ultimate drama. Our customers are some of the most powerful people in the world. But every year, they demand more. More complicated rooms. More interesting subjects. More ways to gamble on life and death. Last year, they had college athletes... the year before, savants... and this year we had lone survivors. They wanted to know if luck had anything to do with it. Lucky people don't get kidnapped and tortured by psychopaths. You know, it's kind of hurtful when you call someone a psychopath, huh? I thought it was stupid, too. But here you are... our lowest-odds ever to win... still alive. I really didn't think it was possible... but as I said... you were the long shot. So I won. That means I get to go home, right? Ben... at the end of the Kentucky Derby... do you think the horse gets a prize? Shh... Shh, shh... Hey. Hey, Ben. Come on. Hey, Ben, come on. Come on. Ben. Ben. Ben, come on, get up. Ben, come on, get up. No! You can't leave until we finish our game, Zoey. Okay, we have to make sure that... He's dead. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on, there's a service elevator. You came back for me. Yeah, well, I'm tired of being the only survivor. - Zoey, go, go. - Okay. It's been 24 hours. He's stable now. You should get some rest. He's ready. Dr. Bell, please come to the OR. Dr. Bell, OR, please. Miss Davis? Are you feeling well enough to come with me? Yeah, you're right, we'll have to check that for roof access. All right, everyone, 360. Miss Davis. Wait, this was the waiting room. Okay? And then it turned into a giant oven, okay? And there was fire. The fire came down from the ceiling. We haven't found any evidence of the things you've described. That. Look. This was the duct. There was a painting that came down. Have you ever seen things that weren't there before? I am not imagining this, okay? Look, Ben was there, too. He'll tell you all this when he wakes up. Right. Your friend, Ben Miller? We got a report from the hospital. They found traces of three different illegal substances in his bloodstream. "No way out." - Miss Davis. - It's an anagram. Dr. Wootan Yu. Do you have the heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu help you... No way out. Wootan Yu. - "Wootan Yu" is "No way out." - Miss Davis. No way out, Wootan Yu. This. Look. That was a part of the game. This is part of the game! We've got to vacate the premises. Wootan Yu. Wootan Yu. Thank you. So, are you going to tell me what's going on? I am the new regional sales rep for all of Logan Square. I'm officially client facing. It's for vegan dog food... but, you know, you've got to start somewhere. I'm really proud of you. Is that homework? What is this? Mike Nolan died of a heart attack in a bathroom in Union Station. Jason Walker was thrown from his bike on the I-64... DMT found in his system. Danny Khan drowns in Lake Michigan. Amanda Harper, rock-climbing alone, because that makes sense... falls and dies. There would have been articles for us, too. You've got to let this shit go. I can't just pretend that they never existed. Everyone else who was sent those invitations died... and whoever sent them is still out there. Don't you want answers? We can find them. They rigged the game so that we would lose and we won. We beat them at their own game. I didn't have a lot to go on, but... the logo... it's an impossible object. It's an Escher staircase that turns in on itself. It's totally unique. The numbers are in a pattern on the staircase. 23, 22 in a repeated sequence of right angles. They're coordinates... for an unlisted industrial building in the middle of Manhattan. They're hiding in plain sight. What are we supposed to do with that? - I bought us plane tickets. - Plane tickets? Two weeks, I'm going. Zoey, it's called "survivor's guilt." My therapist says that in order to live, you need to move on. Moving on doesn't mean running. And I'm done running. Are you in? All right. Yeah, I'm in. Let's do it. You're not Jason Bourne, though. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. Come on. It's got to be in here. Found it! X marks the spot. Come on, come on, where is it? This has to be it, right? I've got the tool! Right here. It must connect to the bolt we found. Okay. Try it on the door. See if it'll turn. You can do it. - Anything? - It's not going! - See if you can turn it. - It's not working! - Try clockwise. - Clockwise? - Yeah, clockwise! - Okay. - Something happened here. - What? - Terrain, terrain. - What's this? No, it's another riddle. "I fly without wings, I cry without eyes." - What does that mean? - I don't know. Give me a second! Heads down! Brace for impact! - Wait, "cloud"! Try "cloud"! - "Cloud"? - Yeah, "cloud." - Okay. Try the door! Come on, let's go! Pull up. Caution, terrain. Decision height. Terrain, terrain. Pull up. No, no! Come on! Come on! Caution, terrain. Terrain, terrain. Do something! Pull up. Decision height. Pull up. Ending sim. Do you want to reset? No. Good work. We're ready for game time. I hurt my goddamn hand on that bolt again, Larry. Deboard the simulator. What's the probability of survival? It's approximately four percent. Well, it's not a game if she doesn't stand any chance. We've intercepted her flight information. It's on. I'm so glad Zoey got over her fear of flying. Let's play again. Subtitles by explosiveskull
