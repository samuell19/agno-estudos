I like school lunch It is not an exaggeration to say that I came to teach for this reason Because the food my mother cooks is terrible She didn't cut corners It's just cooking needs taste -Good morning-our family... In order not to hurt mother's heart -Everyone always eats with gusto-Good morning Occasionally, my dad will cry with joy when he orders delivery So school lunch is my most fulfilling meal But I will never let anyone find out about this If it is known that teachers look forward to lunch more than students I will lose the majesty of being a teacher So I just keep silent in my heart Loving school lunch Good morning Why didn't you say hello? Oh What is your attitude? Do you not need to say hello if you memorize words on the way to school? -No... -Listen up It's useless for you to memorize words like this We humans... Only when you concentrate can you grow Memorizing words while walking just feels good about myself -Okay... -Students like you In the future, I will feel indifferent when I bump into people on the road Even think that the other party deserves to be bumped by you I will never forgive this guy Good morning Okay, let's go to class Let's enter the classroom -OK-Come on Is it convenient for Mr. Amari to talk later? Quick action -Good Morning-Countdown 35 Seconds -34! - hurry up! -33! 32! -hurry up! My morning routine It is to express gratitude for recording yesterday's lunch Then confirm today's lunch Yes Today we have the long-awaited Japanese spaghetti master -Napoli pasta-Mr. Amaritian Now this period... You can't talk like that What do you mean? It is the student who memorizes words You are negating the efforts of students to prepare for the exam So I only care about memorizing words Is it okay even if there is a car accident? I mean your tone of accusation Now is the critical moment for junior college students Everyone masters every minute and every second and immerses in hard work I hope you will not trample on their efforts Do you want me to praise the students to the sky? I think sometimes it is necessary This is it You still don't understand what I mean? I have understood I am not correcting your strict guidance But as a third grade tutor, I hope you can change your ways Hello! No running! Morning teacher Kano, are you late? No, I arrived at school 10 minutes ago What are you doing in these 10 minutes? -I went to see the dining room-Why? Because there is Napoli pasta today Candidates still have time to worry about lunch early in the morning? Sorry Go back to the classroom After I was transferred to this school I didn't expect that guy to transfer here Teacher Amari Tian The assembly of the teaching staff is about to begin He is my lunch rival Kanye Hao We are competing with each other for lunch The mid-term exam is over The three students of the country have also entered an important moment in dire straits Including the school year director Zong Fang Mentors of junior high school students Please take care of me As I mentioned every time The aim of our school is "Fortitude and simplicity" Do not pretend to be strong and upright Everyone will uphold this spirit Let's conquer the big exam this year too! it is good! very good Therefore, a banquet will be held tonight as the swearing-in meeting I hope everyone can participate as much as possible It is expected to be held in front of the station's Millet Club I want to count the number of people, is there anyone who can't participate?

[Delicious Lunch Battle: Graduation] The mid-term exam is over and the final exam is approaching Do you know what candidates need most? I think it is concentration That's right, where should we focus? -Of course reading... -Health I can't do anything if I'm not healthy Even if you can't study hard, eat obediently if you want to be healthy And it must be delicious If you don't want to fail the ranking, just concentrate on eating Chewing food slowly can secrete glucose and activate the brain Problems that you didn't understand at first can be easily solved Eating is the means of survival This is the foundation of human beings Don't forget this truth OK What's wrong? (October menu) (Napolitan Pasta, Egg Drop Soup, Sandwich Bread, Fruit Yogurt, Milk) What kind of face is that? What idea does that guy Shen Ye have? Teacher Amari Tian -Good Morning-Early -You are also curious-What does it mean? There is Napoli pasta today Kano was also here just now I talked with students about the importance of eating to candidates So let's confirm by the way Don't confuse me with Shenye Good, good, like this -Just confirm it-no need What plans does Shenye have for today? Noodles sandwiched in bread to make a Naples tycoon? No, he would not think so simple Is it paired with fruit yogurt? Wait a minute Could it be combined with egg drop soup? Forget it, whatever I will implement my own way of lunch -It's Napoli pasta-It feels so delicious -Napoli's pasta is the best-yogurt is even better -It looks great-Give me a little more face -I want more-I know A little more The teacher also helped me clean my glasses Forward (School song of Shu Mingzi Middle School) The windows of the school building are full of greenery Rolling blood full of vitality Work hard to be brave and resolute Grow together We study in Shuzhong Ah Millet Miao Mingzi Middle School It hurts Please clap your hands Get ready... let's talk together -started-started -started-started I'm going to start Today we have the king of Japanese pasta Everyone's favorite Napoli pasta Egg drop soup full of eggs and necessary accompanying runners Sandwich bread and bottled milk The dessert is a white devil Fruit Yogurt What a wonderful dish design I suppressed my emotions all day Now I can finally be liberated Even if it is misunderstood Actually, I have no time to manage the big exam Today is the most grateful day for fork and spoon It can be used as a fork to eat pasta It can also be used as a spoon to taste soup and dessert Perfect two-knife flow It is a magic fork and spoon that condenses human wisdom This is the first What a mild taste Probably the lunch special here The eggs in the egg drop soup are generous Look at this heavy egg flower It doesn't look like a supporting role at all, it is a soup that can be used as a dish It's delicious This is not egg drop soup Tianjin Tangcai Sesame oil is added to enhance the flavor It makes people feel the Chinese style It will be the highlight of today So happy It seems to hear the sound of the brain secreting happy hormones Why are you so delicious Why can you make me become... So happy I heard that pasta is called Pasta in Italy -What? - what's this called? It should be Napoli Pasta Yes, what language is Spaghetti? I don't know Smelly little devil pretends to understand Listen, Spaghetti is Italian means "rope" It is not wrong to belong to Pasta But the point is not this In Naples, Italy There is no Napoli pasta (Napoli, Italy map) It's over! Accidentally blurted out Strange? Forget it, no difference Anyway, children don't understand The point is that Napoli pasta was born in Japan It is said to be the number one Japanese pasta Just put it in your mouth... It will be sticky Then soft QQ It's just limp on the plate Never retain any strong taste It's like cooking yesterday and keeping it in the refrigerator overnight This kind of soft and rotten noodles is in the best state Delicious! Napolitan pasta is really good There is a stupid way of gobbling up This is it His eyes are particularly shining today -I will not lose you-I want too Strange? What a fierce eating face No! Their eating looks more and more divine Savor lunch with gratitude Everyone's innocence looks so noble I look so small when I show off my cold knowledge Yes Nutritious lunch should be delicious and enjoyable I will not admit defeat I want to... Eat it! Concentrate on a big gulp It is the only right way to treat a nutritious lunch How exciting Now I am simply... Entered the realm of selflessness very good I am also satisfied today I am full Strange? What is this sound? What? What is that guy doing? When is he going to chew... What? If you don't want to fail the ranking, just concentrate on eating Chewing food slowly can secrete glucose and activate the brain Problems that you didn't understand at first can be easily solved Glucose? Is he activating his brain? Egg flower carpet? He carefully removed the soup Ready to spread Nawuli pasta What's going on? That... That is... (Ganlitian filter) It's just... Napolitan pasta in the cafe! Stop, stop, stop The iron plate is sizzling and frying noodles Sizzling! Sizzling! Stop! Come and stop him! It looks amazing! Why didn't I discover this trick? I also have so many egg flowers I am talking about cold knowledge about pasta in my head I think those luxurious egg flowers It is unnecessary for egg drop soup I didn't think of it at all... Such a small and ingenious idea 3, 2, 1 Look at the trick! What? This is where? He has booked the coffee shop! Who are you? I have been waiting for a long time, this is dessert Which one are you? Everything... They all look so noble It's just an extra layer of egg flower Human beings can use such imagination Food has the ability to change the space I'm so stupid! That kid... Activate the brain with glucose Give full play to the power of all foods I was confused by the wolf-eating students Forget that you are on the battlefield Be defeated without fighting I am full I lost I lost again Teacher Amari Tian It's time to gather at the Millet Club I said I would not go That's right -But the principal wants me to persuade you-I have made up my mind -It's the swearing-in meeting-what I need is a reflection meeting Reflection meeting? Reflect on what? This is my personal problem I will tell the principal that you have to be busy to reflect You should eat this popsicle on a day like this Home run popsicle When you are defeated at lunch, you must eat ice that can be drawn for a lottery I believe I can hit a home run Missed? Damn it! I'm so mad! Aren't you going to the Millet Club? I originally planned to do so But suddenly Jun became interested Let me buy something to eat too Are you sure? Buying snacks on the way home from school You are not qualified to speak of me -I actually have this-here it is for you -thank you-it's not for sale anyway Here is one for you -Is it ok? - Please use it Are you worried about the big exam? Of course I am worried But I still have other worries It's really strange I didn't expect you to have troubles other than work It surprised me What impression do you have of me? What's wrong? What is this? It is whiskey sugar Whiskey? Don't you love this? Not... No... Nothing Good morning Early Good morning Is Mr. Amari Tian a bit weird? Whiskey candy should not be underestimated! I didn't expect that little drinking would make me like this I don't even remember how I got home Speaking of which... What's wrong? Did something happen? Teacher Amari Tian Teacher! What's wrong with you? Why do you ask? You look less usual halo I usually don't have any halo By the way, wait for me Teacher, we have received this Look Meal Center Tabloid... Do you usually receive this item? No is the first time Although the above are some meaningless trifles But I think you should be interested (New Nutritional Lunch Tasting Session) Starting to emit aura I don't have a halo -Really? -Yes Then I will take this back (Meal Center of Mi Nazi City) Ladies and gentlemen Thank you for taking the time to participate today I am the management nutritionist of the Mi Nazi Food Center My surname is Sifangtian I am also a nutritionist, my surname is Sanada -Please advise-Please advise I would like to invite parents to taste it today Children usually eat lunch at school This trial will reassure everyone The implementation will start next month Based on the plan to promote physical health It is a menu that pays more attention to health We will explain it to you next come This is fried bread Sorry Please use What's going on? What are these dishes? It's heaven at all It is a dream combination of all stars I can't rush, today is just a tasting session I am here for inspection It is definitely not a special trip to enjoy lunch But this is really unbearable Start with curry What? Is this curry? It does taste like curry But it seems weird What do you think? Sorry -Is this curry? -Yes Have you changed any formula? What does it mean? It should be thicker before This time the plan is to promote health In order to increase nutrition and prevent obesity Make curry sauce healthier Reduce oil content as much as possible Added 7 kinds of nutritional elements Because curry is very popular with children It contains a lot of healthy ingredients I don't understand what he is talking about How is that guy? Then eat some bread Dry! What? Has this really exploded? Adding less sugar The advantages of fried bread are completely gone It is no different from sandwich bread Come here! Followed by fried whale meat Soft lying This is the first time I have eaten fried whale meat that is not crispy at all Macaroni Salad This... what is this? Is the feeding center going to destroy the nutritious lunch? I can only count on you, lovely strawberry jam! Shuishui Even jam has become so healthy Where is that dizzying, vulgar sweetness? -What are you doing? - Parents Frozen oranges for dessert are now served Here are the frozen oranges Even if you want to be healthier, you can't do it It is fruit after all It has already been peeled off! What is this? What's wrong? Why has it already been stripped? Oranges after freezing If it is difficult for children to peel, deal with it first It tastes better this way -This is really convenient-yes You mean "better entrance"? It hurts This is not a frozen orange The process of struggling to peel the orange It is also the only way to eat frozen oranges Every dish here is not only orange At first glance, it looks like a tailor-made design for children But lost the essence Did something happen? He seems to mention some essence You people don't even know... The true meaning of nutritious lunch What do you mean? Although you are wearing white laboratory robes But some places... You are not allowed to invade the door This is the side Excuse me You stop Wait a minute -Wait a minute-what's wrong? I am a teacher I am here for inspection today Which school are you from? Miao Mingzi Middle School You look suspicious If you are a teacher, do you need to wear sunglasses to cover it up? Hello (New Nutritional Lunch Tasting Session) Hey stop Don't run! Stop! Welcome How is the situation? Very smooth bald man... What's going on? Is the school lunch going to change soon? And this matter... Is it related to the bald man in the Education Committee? What's wrong? It's rare to see you come to school on holiday You are the one, right? Why did you come? I'm just here to get information for further study This is it Do you always dress like this in private? Yes I usually wear it like this Yes The atmosphere is really embarrassing -Go back-that... What's the matter? About last time... Last time? I am seriously thinking about it What to consider? Excuse me What did I do? Mr. Sifangtian I'm going back first Thank you for your hard work You really care about it What do you care about? That person just now Unexpectedly, there are still people who have illusions about nutritious lunch Then I'll go first Fantasy... Now I want to send back the calligraphy you wrote last week I heard that a theme has been set Please write down your feelings about graduation As a mentor, I must also read it But in conclusion There is no need to look at it Because there are 80% of the students Write "Graduation" directly for the theme of graduation Don't laugh! Is this a brain teaser? Everyone is not thinking at all Do you think graduation is just graduation? What should I write? Everything is fine, like "Departure" Or "Farewell" You are totally lacking in imagination Listening to the big exam is also testing your imagination If you don't have the ability to imagine the intention of the topic The only way to fail in the exam and in life After school today, we will start interviews for higher education Give me energy The person whose name is called will come and get it -Three Wheels-Yes -Jinmu-Yes -Kano-Yes What do you mean by writing this? 9-year compulsory education Eating out lunch is what I consider "graduation" Are you kidding me? No I'm serious With your grades, you should be able to go to a better school It's okay, I want to go to Beigao But it is rare for you to improve your grades It is the lowest ranked public high school nearby It was even jokingly called "the tail of the crane in the North District" You have no reason to like that kind of school -Tell me why-Don't do this Because the students in the field want to read there -What? -He is going to this school What does it have to do with you? Because we are dating We agreed to go to the same high school Are you serious? -Dechang is an idiot-Mr. Amaritian Because of impulsive cooperation with the other party to choose a bad school If we break up, we will only regret it Think about it again Go back It really surprised me Do you know that they date? There is a vague discovery Everyone will help her eat things she doesn't like What? Can you find out that they are in a relationship just like this? Sharing food with each other is no different from husband and wife Kano, your wish is Changjie High School Is it enough to just choose the first choice? Yes, I decided to only apply for Changjie High School Have you ever attended Changjie Middle School? Yes, so I am also familiar with that area This guy... Only Changjie High School nearby has education subjects Do you want to be a teacher in the future? I have that plan I understand Don't worry about your grades, I think it's OK What do you think? You plan to become a teacher and continue to eat nutritious lunch Teacher Gan Litian? This is exactly like me What? The little giant in the orange shop Moroccan Yogurt Did not win the prize but forget it I will no longer be affected by the result of the lottery Sweet with a touch of sour I don’t know what kind of rough texture it is, but it’s also very good Morocco in the name is also very mysterious But this is for me It is definitely the most wonderful taste today There is wine in there How is it possible? Did you feel weird like last time? What happened last time? This is the first time I saw someone get drunk like that Have you seen it all? Please tell me if you were there What did I do? I don't have much appetite today If you want to eat Do you want to taste it? Is it ok? I am so happy It contains my own pickled Nara pickles There is just one left, please use it It's really delicious This is really... It's so delicious That's good Especially this one What is the name of Nara... It's called Nara pickles This is awesome I like pickles very much Are you okay? Should be someone like you What do you mean? If you want to marry a wife... What nonsense are you suddenly talking about! I mean it... If you are my wife I don't know how good it is What does it mean? Please don't play tricks on me! I'm not playing tricks on you Please think about it How could this happen! Have you made any progress? The atmosphere has become very awkward I think so too That is an irresistible force It's all due to the drunks who eat alcohol, sugar and Nara pickles What's the matter? I made a process description on the day of the big exam Please also send it to the students in Class 1 Why do people from the feeding center come to our school? Because I care about one thing Among the teachers in this school Is there anyone who is particularly concerned about nutritious lunch? Yes You mean Mr. Gan Litian Teacher Gan Litian? What is that? The school song will be played before lunch Yes After doing this, the students will eat up their lunch for no reason This is also Mr. Amari's idea He said that eating lunch is the most important campus activity every day We should sing the school song and unite as one That Mr. Gan Litian -I really think about the school-Ah Mizhong -Not so much for the school-Miao Mingzi Middle School It should be for lunch Rivers and rivers in the village Honest heart is clean and flawless Forward without hesitation Light together We study in Shuzhong Ah Millet Miao Mingzi Middle School Please clap your hands Get ready... let's talk together -started-started -started-started I'm going to start Lunch smells no fragrance Jambal Can't feel any flavor There are also Tsukudani clams Today's Green Apple Jelly It is not an ordinary packaging The recently appeared egg drop soup appeared again The egg flower inside is extremely thin What's more important is that the portion is small enough Strange? It's weird What's wrong? Usually he would eat very happily in one go And eat with gusto Do you mean teacher? The teacher will be hungry too Although I feel strange You still have to start it Ready to eat Look My pair of Wajima lacquer chopsticks with black light Tableware can change the taste of food Egg flower looks like it doesn't. Not satisfied Basically the same as clear soup Hey you guy You tasted richer last week, right? What happened? This is not the usual taste Something seems to be missing What is missing? In the past, people ate plain rice with stew After rice pots appeared in the middle of the Edo period Changed to cooking method Because white rice was very expensive at that time Peas and green onions will be added to increase the volume People discover the deliciousness of jambalaya after mixing ingredients Gradually developed chicken rice and oyster rice The fishermen in Fukagawa put clams Created the famous Fukagawa rice Sorry for picking so many At least these dishes It is much more delicious than my mother's People can't ask for too much The next step is to cook clams Steamed clams with wine and stewed with those soups Huh? What's wrong? Field -Yes-What are you doing? Nothing It's gone How is it possible? Sure enough, even you guys think it's not enough Probably because today's lunch is not very tasty Sorry What do you think is the essence of a nutritious lunch? Ms. Amari Tian once asked me this God knows In fact, Mr. Gan Litian is very simple Trivial things in general society Everyone will make it very complicated But it's actually not a big deal Mr. Amari Tian is particularly sensitive to this aspect If it's a child, I think it's okay But I think such an adult is too irresponsible Wait! But I still have this guy! Lovely green apple jelly! Strange? Strange? Hello! Fork key... Did you forget to send it? There is no spoon this time Eat directly with chopsticks -That's it-forget it Why? Even if only this dish needs a fork It will definitely be specially prepared before It's so slack! What is the plan of the feeding center? So sour! This tastes like cold weather No sweetness "Half of it is frozen!" Not even this little fun Dessert can enhance the satisfaction after a meal Even a nutritious lunch is the same But today I don't feel satisfied at all What's wrong? What? That is... Fukagawa rice! Here we go again! Why didn't I find it? Obviously I have studied Fukagawa rice in my mind just now What kind of taste is obviously missing from today's jambalaya The boy found out that what is missing is delicious taste After noticing this He thought of using the sauce of Tsukudani clams It can be said to be the aesthetics of addition Show me it now! Another empty bowl? Could it be... No That is... Fukagawa rice balls! Could you give me one? That's right I want to go to Fukagawa Fan! It must be delicious like that! This guy... Today's lunch is obviously different from usual So he changed the plan from the beginning Facing these light meals like those provided by the hospital He used his ingenuity I also chose not to worry about tableware How to eat rice balls that can be eaten with hands What the hell was I doing when he did this? I just complain about these different flavors I lament how neglectful the person who designed the dishes Take yourself as a victim and speak plausibly I don't know how to try hard at all Let yourself be satisfied in lunch I lost Losing badly But this kind of nutritious lunch... I can't accept But in my position Can you tell students not to eat this kind of weird lunch? As a teacher, you should tell them to eat Even though these meals It is not the lunch I know This is really... It's too painful The taste is completely different from usual, too strange The serving size is also very small But I don't know about auntie Sorry I will tell you when I know the reason OK Sorry Teacher Amari Tian Did something happen? That's... He said today's lunch was weird I really think the weight of the vegetable bucket is lighter than usual Teacher, do you feel anything strange? I don't know I'm not interested in lunch -It’s too late-I’m sorry Speaking of which, he especially likes to eat white food White food? This is what the dining room is called He loves white rice and white milk the most He has been confirming with me just now - Rice and milk won't change, right?- Will it change? How could it be necessary for lunch -also-but... Hearing him say the taste is weird makes me feel a great responsibility Hi -Where is your bicycle? - Gone -Good Morning-Early -Have you cut your hair yet? -Good morning Morning teacher Good morning (Assorted Rice, Tsukudani Clams, Egg Drop Soup, Green Apple Jelly, Milk) (Complete) (Curry, Rice, Vegetable Salad, Orange Jelly, Milk) Kano, what are you doing? I am reviewing today's class I want to read at home The big exam is just around the corner OK What's the matter? Does the teacher think this is really good? What do you mean? It is school lunch What happened to lunch? -Before it should be... -Kano The school provides lunch every day Any questions? School is a place to study What's more, you are still a candidate Yes Go home soon Excuse me... are you okay? Why do you ask this? Nothing The big exam is coming soon I want to go all out without leaving any regrets Excuse me The big exam is coming soon How are the students doing? Teacher Zongfang is working hard to help everyone This is it Is there any change in Teacher Zongfang? What does it mean? In fact, a few months ago I helped Teacher Zongfang arrange a blind date Are you on a blind date? Yes My interest is being a matchmaker And I will only match teachers Nine couples have been successfully matched so far Friends in Hakodate asked me for help I introduced Mr. Zongfang She was very reluctant at first But I still push her to play After the meeting I found that the man is sincere and honest The atmosphere between the two has also become very good When I thought the tenth couple was about to be born Mr. Zongfang seems to have suddenly lost interest But the man is urging me to reply, which hurts my brain So... Can you find a chance... Help me find out? If it was you, you must be able to ask very straightforward Please, please What do you want me to find out? I recommend her that Hakodate is a good place Is she going to Hakodate? Yes, the man is a teacher in a middle school in Hakodate But there are not enough people there There is no way to transfer him here Goodbye -Goodbye Teacher-Goodbye -Goodbye teacher-goodbye (Changjie Senior High School Entrance Examination Venue) It's Kamino -How are you doing? -Long time no see -Kano-Wait You also come to this high school for the exam? um It's the same high school -You have to work hard-Come on Come on, come on Next month's lunch menu is here -Thank you-come This is also for you, Mr. Gan Litian come This... What's going on? (from this month all white rice will be replaced with wheat rice) Replace all white rice with wheat rice -Teacher Gan Litian? -This... Will it also be distributed to students? It should have been sent out -Oops-Oops? -White food-What is white? Kamino! Kamino! Kamino! Stop! Kamino! Kamino! What kind of taxi do middle school students take! Why! The center director meeting starts at nine o'clock, right? Mr. Kasaki will also be present today -I really don't know how to deal with him-Sanada -You think so too? -I don't have We move fast Hey, what are you going to do? -What are you doing? - let me go -I won't let it go-let me in What are you going to do? Please let me meet the person in charge here -I can't let go-What's wrong? -He rushed in suddenly-Is it someone from the feeding center? -give me almost a little-I have questions about the menu Menu? Don't you need to go to school? Which school do you have? My name is Shenye in the third grade of Mi Mingzi Middle School Do you have any questions about the menu? The meeting is about to start Can I hear it? This is the school's lunch leftover rate chart for the past week The data is obviously rising How did you investigate? I asked the people in the dining room to assist in the investigation For what? In exchange for the original delicious lunch The original lunch? Next month's lunch menu Replace white rice with wheat rice That is indeed the plan Everyone is very disappointed It should be said... I want to eat plain rice -Wheat rice is good for the body-if you want to be healthy The most important thing is to eat delicious The barley rice is delicious! Wheat rice is rich in dietary fiber and protein There are many vitamins It is more nutritious for those of you who are growing up You can say that you are in the third grade of Mi Mingzi Middle School Who is your mentor? -Mr. Gan Litian-What? -Mr. Sifangtian-Yes As a reference, let him put forward opinions at the meeting But... It is a valuable opinion from the students themselves He also seems to be looking forward to this development Sorry for your trouble Say hello to everyone My name is Shen Ye, and I am studying in Class 1, Grade 3, Mi Ming Zi Middle School -Today... -This student... There seems to be complaints about the new nutritious lunch Is that right? Lunch in recent months tastes weird I understand that you are very concerned about our health But a nutritious lunch should not only focus on health How do you say that? Eating lunch is the greatest joy of campus life You are now a third-year student! Don't talk like you're still in primary school It's the third year junior high school student who wants to say that we don't have time No time? Stop talking nonsense Your life is just about to begin The nutritious lunch in my life is coming to an end Please Please let me eat my lunch with satisfaction Have you said enough? You are just too picky We changed the menu only for the sake of students You are not only ungrateful It's ridiculous to dare to complain Is there someone instigating you behind your back? For example, your tutor No This is my personal opinion Kamino! Kamino! We are having a meeting -Kano-Wait What are you going to do? -Non-related people... -Don't do this Everyone too What is this doing? Is a group of adults besieging a middle school student? I haven't seen you for so long, don't you know how to say hello? You are not worthy of my greeting What? It's so rude! You once canceled the nutritious lunch in a middle school Also transferred the protesting teachers to other schools I tried to cancel the nutritious lunch again but failed This time is to change the taste of lunch This move... It's obviously targeting me Please don't say that kind of misleading words Ensuring the health of students is the real food education Nutrition lunch is not mobile food If you only pay attention to health It means you don't understand students at all Is this telling us to cater to students? No student wants to eat bad lunch Why don't you understand this simple truth? Require students to eat obediently It is your teacher's responsibility! You admit it's unpalatable, right I want to ask everyone here You want to force children every day Swallow a lunch so bad that you would rather throw it away? It's better not to visit bad ramen shops However, students cannot choose a feeding center If you want to force students to eat You must also know how to put in the corresponding effort! Can you guarantee that you have achieved this? Let children not be picky eaters and make healthy meals It is our best effort! You transferred me because you thought I was an eyesore Are you qualified to say that? What did you say? Let me be honest, a nutritious lunch is a mess Everything should be served with bread and milk, a mix of Chinese, Western and Japanese It is oily and tasteless, it is inconvenient to eat and sticky But this is the best Meals provided by the school Students will find ways to change patterns What the children need Curiosity and creativity A person who blindly caters to students It should be you guys Although wheat rice is not bad I can't accept not providing white rice for the sake of health Is this what you want to say? It is totally not what a teacher should say Rogues who quarrel over food OK This is the end of the sideshow Take that student out of here quickly! Why? Your attitude is wrong! Do you still want to be transferred? Let me go! Please let go... The resentment produced by food is terrible Because I... Deeply in love with... Delicious school lunch Let you wait so long for us to go -Mr. Gan Litian-What's the matter? Sorry I didn't expect you to break into the scene by yourself Yes You... Sometimes when you get angry, you will lose your sense of proportion Yes However... You did nothing wrong Yes -Excuse me-what? -Teacher-What do you do? I can only follow the guidelines of the feeding center However... This is why you came to the tasting meeting last time You mentioned the essence of nutritious lunch before I can understand a little bit now This is it I want to make a delicious nutritious lunch Sorry for your trouble Teacher Have you ever been to the scene before? I didn't go to the scene -But... -Kano Do you think students can take a taxi alone? Sorry You are 10 years too early OK Tomorrow is the graduation ceremony The three teachers in charge of the third grade have worked hard for you Ms. Zongfang, the school year director, please say something OK Students have gone all out Thanks to everyone for helping us pass the exam I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone It must be a lot of pressure for you to be the director of the school year for the first time But you still fulfilled your duties, I am very grateful In addition There will be new teachers to teach in the new semester It is from Ninkawa Middle School in Hakodate Teacher Akimoto who teaches mathematics This time he will come to our school to coach Because of this Our school must send teachers to Hakodate to fill the vacancy It was decided that Mr. Gan Litian would go to Ninkawa Middle School Though it happened suddenly Teacher Amari will only stay until tomorrow Wait a minute... Ms. Gan Litian, please say a few words OK Although I only stayed here for 2 years I still receive a lot of care from everyone Although the transfer was sudden I will work hard in the new environment in the future Please explain clearly I don't understand what's going on What do you mean? Why do you want to fill in the vacancy of Teacher Qiuben? Because it just meets each other's needs Someone who wants to come here, but someone who wants to go to Hakodate goes there That's all Is it arranged by the principal? There is only one beginning But it is my personal wish now Because... did you tell me those words? Please ask me before the principal Please let me know where your relationship is going But before that I want to confirm the person of the other party first If he is a boring man I don't need to ask what you mean I'm calling... Talked with Teacher Akimoto Then... -What is the result? -We had a great chat -Have fun? -Yes I understand that he is serious about you How do you know? For example, when I asked him to eat in a restaurant What will he do if there is food you hate He said he would eat the things you hate -What does it mean? - heard him say that I am sure he is sincere Your logic is too weird However, even if the feelings are true It is difficult for two people to understand each other even if they are far away So... I thought of the best way Let us exchange workplaces But I don't understand why it was you in the past As long as I stay here You can't protect the nutritious lunch here What? As long as I leave The original delicious lunch will definitely come back Why did you come to this conclusion? For each other It can be said to be a win-win result You are really full of brains... Thinking about school lunch Today is my last time Taste the lunch of this school Excuse me Teacher What's the matter? Auntie of the Ganzai shop told me that you were drunk that day I am really sorry that day I was fooled by you How should I explain But I'm still a little happy I'm sorry I decided to accept your words Believe everything you say But... Even if you go to Hakodate, I hope you remember... I take your words to heart Then your marriage... I just keep it in my heart I guess when you are drunk I will only tell the truth That was my first time... Get your affirmation The last nutritious lunch I hope it will be delicious Yes -Come and move-OK This taste... This is... I want to make a delicious nutritious lunch The most nutritious lunch It's really great Teacher You are not allowed to jump in line -Please line up obediently-OK Well done Meal Center -Let me see-no The windows of the school building are full of greenery Rolling blood full of vitality Work hard to be brave and resolute Grow together We study in Shuzhong Ah Millet Middle School Miao Mingzi Middle School Curling and combing the rivers in the ice town Honest heart is clean and flawless Forward without hesitation Light together We study in Shuzhong Ah millet name Miao Mingzi Middle School It hurts Please clap your hands Get ready... let's talk together -started-started -started-started I'm going to start Wait There is one more cake roll Long Live Can the teacher use guessing to make a decision? I want to participate in boxing guessing -me too-me too Rock paper scissors! Rock paper scissors! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! -Again! Yeah! 200 meals per year 9 years of compulsory education total 1800 meals For them, this will be the last nutritious lunch I have been teaching for 12 years This is my 4215th nutritious lunch Every year, the dishes are special on the day before graduation It is the last meal to bless the students on their journey I thought I would lose this fun this year But the gods did not abandon me Look at this perfect and wonderful finale Today's lunch There are classic meals that are very suitable as the finale Curry Rice The side dishes include devil-level meat hamburger steak Soothing soup with kelp sprouts Bottled milk as usual And I want to put a candle... Fluffy Strawberry Cake Roll Too perfect Thanks to you this year too All-purpose tableware that Japan is proud of Cute fork and spoon This is the final battle Where should I start eating? Generally, rice is slowly topped with curry The method of soaking rice in curry is also very OK After switching to plain rice, this common combination finally appeared Thinking about how to eat curry is really a luxury trouble And today there are burger steaks It's like asking me to combine curry rice with hamburger steak In other words, that guy is... No! I can't have distracting thoughts I just want to eat what I want Today I want to scoop up rice by the spoonful Soak into the ocean of curry After all, this is the last time I want to savor every bite This is the behavior of a mature adult It's so delicious The curry rice that can be swallowed is of course delicious But the rice curry with reversed order is also unique And... There is still this one today, this is it Look at my awesome burger steak! This is the happiness of eating meat and rice at the same time This is heaven at all What? So it is true You are right every time This is enough Children should remain innocent The adult who lost his innocence I will start to imagine all kinds of meaningless plans I think I am right Adults think too much and laugh at children for being naive I didn't realize that I was getting further and further away from the truth I decided... No more detours Ready to eat I am full I am full Satisfied -goodbye-bye -bye-bye-bye Break off Excuse me -Hello teacher-Hello everyone -It's really hard work for you-each other Kano also came to say hello just now He said thank you for our care in the past 3 years -This is it-Yes It will be lonely without that child I forgot to mention that I will only stay until tomorrow What? I am going to teach in Hakodate Hakodate? Why is it like this? Thank you for your care Wait a minute, teacher Teacher Look here I want you to see this What do you think is a delicious nutritious lunch? Favorite curry rice and ramen Spaghetti, fried noodles These meals may appear in your mind But these can also be eaten at home Why do you find it delicious when you eat it at school? I hated school lunch when I was young At that time, it was stipulated that lunch must be finished Even if the time is short If you don't finish eating, you will be scolded Know how to cherish food and never leave it behind Although this truth is true But I still hate this habit So lunch at that time I hardly remember what it tastes like Because we have to finish eating within time At that time, I only thought about this matter You must feel the deliciousness of Xiamen cuisine It is necessary to create an environment that one can enjoy in it Lunch at school should be fun Because for children, this is leaving their parents' side First dining out experience In order to let everyone experience these I will only work in the feeding center I sincerely hope everyone Won't hate school lunch A recent incident reminded me of these principles Although the environment cannot be easily changed But I really hope I can bring health and fun to everyone Wish you all a delicious lunch Congratulations on your list Thank you teacher I know what you are thinking -idea? -You intend to become a teacher Continue to eat school lunch Have you been discovered by the teacher? too obvious Just like a teacher Don't confuse us But my goal is not only that What does it mean? I want to become a teacher before entering the Education Committee I want to protect school lunches across the country Because I want the teacher to have delicious lunch forever I will look forward to it I heard that the teacher is leaving this school too Yes, I will start teaching in Hakodate in April Hakodate? It's really far away But I heard that you can have squid rice for lunch Squid rice? -Amazing-Sorry You will not be able to eat a nutritious lunch for the time being I will find a way to go back to school Kano, sit down Yes A farewell gift for you I am so happy If I win, I plan to do the same thing This is it I am very happy to meet the teacher Me too I'm going to start Is it delicious? Delicious It looks really delicious (Congratulations on graduation)
