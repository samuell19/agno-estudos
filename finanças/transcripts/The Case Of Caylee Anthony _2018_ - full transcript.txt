- In Florida, police are investigating the disappearance of a two-year-old toddler. The little girl was not reported missing for five weeks. The mother, 22-year-old Casey Anthony, is under arrest on charges of child neglect and obstructing the investigation. The child's grandparents say they have a gut feeling their granddaughter is still alive. - It's been 10 years since the start of one of the biggest unsolved cases in American history. In July 2008, Caylee Anthony's grandmother reported that Caylee had been missing for over 30 days. - 911 What's your emergency? - There's something wrong, I can't find my granddaughter. I found my daughter's car today, and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car. - In October, her mother Casey Anthony was charged with Caylee's murder. In December, they found the body less than half a mile from the family home. - Any comment, Casey? - Casey, what happened? - Casey, what can you tell us about Caylee? - This controversial case created a media firestorm that drew the court of public opinion to a fever pitch. - Next time I see you or anyone else on my property, I will file charges on you, think I'm kiddin'? - The jury has reached a verdict. - We the jury find the defendant not guilty. - Ultimately, the trial ended in an acquittal. In the intervening decade, there have been no further charges, and no justice for little Caylee Anthony. - We're talkin' about a three-year-old little girl. - My name is Jim Clemente, I'm a retired FBI profiler. I'm also a former New York City prosecutor. I'm and expert in the field of child abduction and child abduction homicides. - My name's Laura Richards, I'm a criminal behavioral analyst, and I spent a decade working at New Scotland Yard, running the homicide prevention unit. We've decided to reexamine the case of two-year-old Caylee Anthony, to see if we can reveal any clues into why her death remains unsolved 10 years later. This case is challenging because you have 10 years and you have a mother who was acquitted. - It's really two levels of inquiry. One level of inquiry is about what happened to Caylee, who was involved in what happened to her, and how she ended up in that swampy area. And the other level is, what really was going on in that family? Also, the question hangs out there, did somebody kill her, or did she die accidentally? We just have to keep digging to find out. The prosecution went after Caylee's mother, Casey, for charges that included first degree murder. The defense argued that Caylee accidentally died, and Casey Anthony wasn't responsible for Caylee's death. - This is a little girl, and her life was taken away from her, and I just feel that she hasn't had justice and her voice hasn't been heard. - This is one of the most confounding cases in the history of U.S. law enforcement. We should start by familiarizing ourselves with Caylee's immediate family. It's a pretty tight family unit. Caylee, her mother, Casey, grandmother Cindy, grandfather George, and her uncle, Lee. This family from the outside looks like the average, all-American family. - George worked in the police. - Former police officer from the state of Ohio. - He worked cases of car theft, drugs, and homicide. And Cindy worked as a nurse. They're people who are in the caring professions. - Yeah. - Then we've got Casey's brother, which is Lee, he's four years older than Casey. He wasn't actually living at the address at the time. - Casey and Lee were both cared after kids, they grew up into adulthood without any problems. There's no history of any kind of neglect. - But then at 19, Casey gives birth to Caylee. And for Casey as a mother, I mean I hadn't heard any reports about her being a bad mother. Everything seems to point to the fact that she was a loving mom who adored Caylee. - There's a lot of events that we really need to ask questions about. To help us peel back the layers of this mystery, Laura and I have assembled an incredible team of experts, some of whom were involved with the original case. Special Agent Nick Savage is an active FBI agent, and former coordinator for crimes against children. Coming from the FBI's Miami division, he was the agent assigned to the investigation. He brings a comprehensive insider's understanding of the case. Dr. Karl Williams is a forensic pathologist with over 30 years of experience. He's an authority on the human body, and analysis of physical evidence. He's new to this case, and bring us a critical fresh perspective. Jim Fitzgerald is a fellow FBI profiler and forensic linguist, with a record of tracking down high profile offenders, like the Unabomber. Fitz is an expert on the mind, and he can offer insights into how a person's feelings are manifested in their words or actions. - How does it feel coming back to review the case of Caylee Anthony 10 years on, Nick? - There are still many of us that have never actually forgotten this little child and this has never really left me, this is something that consumed so much of my life for so long and still kind of owns a part a me, to this day. - Of course being father myself, the worst possible scenario is having a child be hurt. - The death of children are the most troublesome cases we investigate, anytime. That's why this case for me is an extraordinary opportunity to review and add my expertise, trying to figure out what happened. - Our mission to throw out everything we think we know and start from the beginning. The hope is to find clarity for Caylee. So why don't we talk about then how this case actually was initiated for law enforcement. - On the night of July 15th, there were three 911 calls from the grandmother, Cindy Anthony. And there was certainly an escalation of those calls that kind of started with allegations of theft and then eventually to the disappearance of the child. - Perhaps we should listen to those calls. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think that would be very helpful. - Right. - So why don't we listen to the first call. - Hello. - Hi, I need to bring someone in to the police department, can you tell me where I can, the closest one I can come into. - What are you trying to accomplish by bringing 'em to the station? - I have a 22-year-old person that has grand theft, sitting in my auto with me. - So, the 22-year-old person stole something? - Yes. Is this a relative? - Yes. - Okay, is this your son? - Daughter. My car was stolen, we've retrieved it today, we found out where it was at, and I've got affidavits from my banking account. I want to bring her in, I want to press charges. - Where did all of this happen? - Hopespring Drive. - That's actually gonna be in the jurisdiction of the sheriff's office, let me transfer you. - Okay, 'cause my next thing will be that child's thing, and we'll have a court order to get her. If that's the way you want to play, we'll do it, and you'll never... - I'm... - Well then you have, no, I'm not giving you another day, I've given you a month. - The behavioral aspects and the dynamics of this are so bizarre, Cindy is very pragmatic here, she apparently knows that Caylee is not right in their personal environment. However, that's not the focus of the issue right here. The focus is the car that had been missing. Cindy doesn't even really know yet what really is the major situation here, that is, her missing granddaughter. - The sheriff's office eventually tells Cindy to go home and call 911. - Okay, well why don't we play on. - Listen to the rest of it? - Yeah. - So this is the second call, once they've got back to the home address. - 911. - I have someone here that I need to be arrested, in my home. - They're there right now? - And I have a possible missing child, I have a three year old that's been missing for a month. - A three year old? - Yeah. - Have you reported that? - I'm trying to do that now, ma'am. I'd like to speak to an officer, can you have someone come out to my house? - Okay, okay I gotta ask you these questions so I can put 'em in the call, okay? - Okay. Okay, what's her name? - Casey Anthony. Casey's there right now? - Yes, I got her, I finally found her after a month, she's been missing for a month. I found her, but we can't find my granddaughter. - Is Casey not telling you where her daughter is? - Correct. - Okay, we'll have a deputy out to you as soon as one's available, okay? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Wow. - So this is the third call, which is 1 1/2 hours later, before a deputy was deployed. - 911 what's your emergency? - I called a little bit ago, the deputy sheriff's coming out, I found out my granddaughter has been taken, she has been missing for a month, her mother finally admitted that she's been missing. She just admitted to me that she's been trying to find her herself. Okay, what, what did... - Get someone here now, we're talking about a three-year-old little girl, I need to find her. There's something wrong, I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car. My daughter finally admitted that the babysitter stole her. - What kind of response does that elicit from law enforcement? - Well certainly, you talk about an escalation. I mean, that kind of then just sets the tone as to the seriousness of what we may be getting into. Not only just knowing what was said, it was the way that phone call came in. You could hear that in Cindy Anthony's voice. - Absolutely, the emotion, of course. - It escalated to shear panic. - How long has she been missing for? - I have not seen her since the seventh of June. George, Caylee's missing. Caylee's missing. - Is your daughter there? - Yes. - Can I speak with her? - Casey, the sheriff wants, they want to talk to you. - Hello? - Hello? - Yes. - Can you tell me a little bit what's goin' on? - My daughter's been missing for the last 31 days. - And you last saw her a month ago? - 31 days, it's been 31 days. - A very calm reaction from the mother. I mean remember it's the grandmother who is panicky, you can hear the fear, the concern, that her life is spiraling out of control. You can hear her going into meltdown. But not Casey, Casey seems to have been very calm. - Who has her, do you have a name? - Her name is Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. - Who is that? Babysitter? - She's been my nanny for about a year and a half, almost two years. - And why, why are you calling now? Why didn't you call 31 days ago? - I have been looking for her and have gone through other resources to try to find her, which was stupid. - When you listen to that last 911 call, it's still as bizarre today as it was from the minute I got involved in this case. - We turned down a dead end hall, and there's really no place else to walk, and at that point, she turns and looks at us and says, "I don't really work here." - Is it that there's some other thing more important in your life right now, or did you purposely mislead us? Which of those two is it? - I purposely misled... - Okay, so you purposely misled us. This was all an attempt to help find your daughter, right? (Sic) - The Orange County Sheriff's Office was not alerted to the disappearance of two-year-old Caylee Anthony for 31 days. And that kind of delay really hampers any kind of investigation of a missing child. - And that's what stands out, it was an anomaly right from the start. It was actually Cindy Anthony who reported her missing. - Yeah. - The thing that struck everyone that day, even the 911 operator, was the 31 days. - And, why, why are you calling now? Why didn't you call 31 days ago? - Likely one of the most controversial facts in this whole case. But as we've been saying, it's the little girl herself, Caylee Anthony, who seems to be forgotten, and we know the least about. - My sense is we're gonna find some very different things when we look at the facts and evidence alone. But I think it's really important we start with the victimology, and we paint a picture of who Caylee Anthony was. I strongly believe throughout my whole career that if you find out how somebody lived, you'll find out how they died. And that's the place that we need to start. So exactly what we know about Caylee Marie Anthony. - Two years, 10 months old. - Brown eyes, and quite long hair, and shoulder length. So Casey was her mother, she was 19 years old when she was pregnant. - So she was just a kid herself. Caylee was living at her grandparents' house, nice neighborhood, with her mother. So she had an intact family, at least partially intact. Was in an environment where she was being cared for. - And certainly all the pictures of the home look like she was not just looked after and her needs met, but she was doted upon. I mean her bedroom shows signs of a little girl that was cared for and loved. There was a swimming pool there, and it sounds like she loved going swimming. You know, it's not just looking at the home address and seeing that she has her own bedroom, but it's also the grandparents investing time in looking after her. - So here's the big question, who's the father of Caylee Anthony? - That is the big question. Casey didn't tell the police who Caylee's father really is. We do know that a few people were named, and I think the first interesting one who Casey started a relationship with. - Right, they were engaged. - But a paternity test ruled him out. - Right. - Eric Baker was brought up by Cindy and George at trial as the possible father, but he died in a car accident in 2007. There was also a Michael Duggan, he also died in a car accident in 2007. His mother Donna came forwards. She told the newspapers she was 100% certain that Caylee was her granddaughter. But this wasn't proven. - Well, this is a mystery. - It is. And there are other odd factors surrounding Caylee's birth. The defense stated that when Casey was pregnant, Cindy and George denied it. - This is Casey, seven months pregnant. Everyone wanted to know who the pregnant girl was, but yet the entire family wanted to keep it quiet. They hid this beautiful child, like a flower in the attic. - Why all the denials and questions around this pregnancy? We just don't know. - And Casey has little Caylee on August 9, 2005. And we mustn't forget that she was young when she became pregnant. And it seemed really stepped up to help look after Caylee. And like with every case, Jim, you start to scratch the surface on what looks like a perfect family, and you start to see that the perfect family doesn't exist. Normally when you conduct analysis around the victimology, you talk to the people who knew them the best to understand the dynamics of the relationships. We tried reaching out to the Anthony family, but they didn't want to speak to us. So, we reached out to the people who were around Caylee at the time that she went missing. At the end of May, 2008, two months before Caylee went missing, Casey started dating her new boyfriend, Tony Lazzaro, often hanging out at his apartment with his roommates, and she'd take Caylee along with her. - Have you been able to talk to any of the other roommates? - Well, Cameron Campana, who was renting with Tony, he's keen to chat with us, so he might be able to provide some more insight because he was there throughout that period of time. - Great, well why don't we give him a call? - Hello. - Hi, it's Laura Richards calling, how are you? - Good, how about yourself? - I'm very well, thank you. We've been really trying to understand Caylee, what was she like as a little girl, can you describe her? - Oh, she was adorable, she was energetic, very polite, and she was always laughing, seemed like she was always having a great time, you know. - She was talking and walking and interacting with you all? - Yeah, she wasn't a shy little girl. But she also wasn't wild or anything like that. - And how would you describe her interactions with Casey? - Casey seemed like a really good mom, you know, she, I never saw her like yell at her or anything like that seeming like there was any mistreatment or anything. Caylee would put on something or drew a picture or somethin' like that, and she would show her mom, and Casey would say, "Oh good job, honey," you know. She was a loving mom. - And you saw them interacting together. - Yeah, Caylee was doin' that, she was such a young girl. - Yeah, well we know how you feel about that, that's why we're doing this, actually. And the last thing we want to do is forget Caylee in this, we want to give her her voice. - Well thank you for your help, we appreciate your time. - Oh, no problem. - Well that was a very informative call. - It is really interesting, you know, she was a good mother and she did spend time interacting with her, and that Caylee was a confident little girl. - Have you been able to talk to any of the other roommates? - Well, I know that Clint House, who's one of the friends of Tony Lazzaro, and he was living at the house at the time when Casey and Caylee were going there. He might be able to provide some more insight because he was there throughout that period of time. - Great. - Clint testified about his experiences with Caylee and Casey. - During the time period of May, June of 2008, did you meet a woman by the name of Casey Anthony? - Yes, I did. She seemed like a fun party girl, somebody that would probably get along well with our group of friends. - Hi, Clint. - How are ya? - I'm very well, Laura Richards. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Come on in. - Clint, when did you first meet Casey Anthony? - First time I ever met Casey was in 2008 through my friend Tony, who was also my roommate. - When was the first time that you met Caylee? - A few weeks after Tony and Casey started dating, she decided to bring Caylee over. The first time that she came into our apartment with Casey, she came walking in, she had a big pair of sunglasses on and she immediately says, "What's up, dudes?" And then just came walking right in. - She was interacting with you the minute that she walked into the room. - Very engaging. - Would you say she was well looked after, and her needs were being met? - Oh absolutely, she was never screaming about how hungry she was, or she never came over in dirty clothes or a dirty diaper. I never saw Casey raise her voice at Caylee, I never saw her strike Caylee. From what I saw, Caylee loved her mom. You know, there was one time when she stopped coming around that I said to Casey, you know like, where's Caylee because it had gone from at least three or four times a week to nothing, so that was, that was odd. She gave us the same excuse that she's given authorities and the American public. She's with my nanny, or she's with my mom. And we didn't really have a reason to not trust her. Fast forward to the trial, hearing that she had been missing for 31 days and nobody had seen her in over a month, it's terrifying. When I first met her, I would describe her as a good mother. What I would describe her as now, is a liar. - I called a little bit ago. The deputy sheriff's coming out. I found out my granddaughter has been taken. She has been missing for a month. - We've heard from some people close to Caylee and Casey, and ideally, we'd want to hear from Casey herself. But she declined to speak with us. We do however, have her written statement from the night investigators were called to the Anthony home. So we want to take a closer look at Casey, by taking a deep dive into her initial version of events to see what we can learn. - This was Casey Anthony's first statement. She wrote it on the 16th of July, at five minutes past one in the morning. - Correct, this would've been the report that was initiated by the responding officer, post-911 calls. - The fact that it is 3 1/3 pages, what does that tell you? - Casey had 31 days to account for here, and she probably could've written a lot more. But that also means she had 31 days to think about what she was going to tell investigators, and for that matter, put on paper. - Well it's written here the offense is kidnapping, but she actually talked about her disappearance. You know, they're two completely different things, aren't they, a kidnapping, somebody who's taken her daughter, abducted her, has kidnapped her, versus she's just disappeared into thin air. - Yeah, that struck me right away, disappearance, as if some magician snapped his or her fingers. And it helps sort of bring down the true importance of this, 'cause if something disappears, it's very possible like with a magician, it'll appear again. - And she would have more accurately said, the day she was abducted, supposedly, by Zani. So what about on the second page, Jim? - We have the excellent description of Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, 25 years old, from New York, roughly five foot, seven inches tall. - She actually gave an artist's sketch of Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. - That's an incredible amount of detail, and she must have sat with a forensic artist to do that for quite a bit of time. - Based on the first information provided to law enforcement, Zenaida Gonzalez was in fact the first suspect in this investigation. - That completely washed out, there was absolutely no evidence that anybody named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez had anything to do with Caylee Anthony's disappearance. - Correct. - On the second page, there's some really strange language being used. For example, Casey says, I'd called Zenaida earlier that morning, after dropping off Caylee at Zenaida's apartment. - But in the afternoon, her phone was no longer in service, or working. - She's told the police the reason why Zenaida's phone would not ring if they called it. 'Cause it didn't exist in the first place. - I noticed her descriptors for her daughter. She obviously begins it, I took my daughter, Caylee Marie Anthony, okay, that's fine, putting her full name out there, sort of makes sense here. But I counted eight separate times, through this 700 word statement, where she used the phrase, my daughter. She almost like has to prove to whoever's going to be reading this, that, oh by the way, this is my daughter, I want to remind you, and of course, if it's my daughter, I would never do anything to harm her. - I've spent every day looking for my daughter. I have lied and stolen from friends and family to do whatever I could to find my daughter. For the past four weeks, since Caylee's disappearance, I'm tried to find any information about Caylee, whether by going to a popular bar or restaurant. - I asked him, popular bar? - And popular bars, restaurants, I mean that just is so out of place but I'm still intrigued as to why manufacture so many untruths, what purpose do they serve for her? And that's the really important part of this. A fantasy life can be triggered through trauma, as sort of a coping mechanism, So that's what I'm trying to understand, is what purpose do the lies serve for Casey? Just because somebody lies, or doesn't tell the truth, that doesn't make them a murderer. However, Casey's lies continued to be troubling. Casey didn't report her daughter missing for 31 days. Why wasn't she on the phone asking for help? Hoping that Caylee is still alive, and conscious that the clock is ticking, the police take Casey to where she says she's been working, Universal Studios, Orlando. - I was the sergeant in charge of the missing person's squad at the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and so, I oversaw the investigation. Another detective and I went to the house, and we picked Casey up. We suggest to her, hey let's go to Universal Studios and we'll look in your office and see if there's anything that would help us find your daughter. - What was her manner at that point, her demeanor? - She was very calm, I mean just very matter of fact. When we got there, she began dealing with the security guard and he looked into the computer and said, I'm sorry, we don't have anybody That works here by that name. And Casey said, no, I work here, look again. So he asked her, you know, who's your supervisor? Well, she spit out a name. And the security guard again looked into the computer and looked back up with a confused look and said, that person doesn't work here either. What's your phone extension? So Casey spit out a phone extension, and the guy looks at her and says that's not a phone extension here. So at that point, the security director got us through the gate. We walk into the building, and we're kind of making small talk. She's telling me that someday she'd like to be a personal trainer. And we turn down a dead end hall, and there's really no place else to walk. And at that point, she turns and looks at us and says, I don't really work here. And so we sat down and interviewed her. - I'm absolutely petrified. Absolutely petrified. I know my mom will never forgive me. I'm never gonna forgive myself. Because there's that chance that I might not see Caylee again, and I don't want to think about it. - Let me ask you, let me ask you. By lying to us, and sending us on these wild goose chases. Hold on a minute, okay? I want you to tell me is it that there is some other thing more important in your life right now, or did you purposely mislead us? Which of those two is it? - I purposely mislead you. - Okay, so you purposely misled us. This was all an attempt to help find your daughter, right? That makes sense to you, correct? - In a backwards sort of way, yes. - A backwards sort of... - I'm coming back to places that are familiar to me that I know are familiar to her. How old is she? - She's almost three. - She's almost three. What do you think, she is gonna take a cab here? - At some point, she did work at Universal. - She worked for a company there that would take people's pictures as they came into the place, but she hadn't worked there in quite some time. But she was telling her family that she did have a job. That she was going to work everyday. - So she was leaving every day. And where is she going? - She wasn't going to work. Once we finished the interview at Universal, we went back to the sheriff's office, and there we made the decision to arrest her and charge her with child neglect. So, you know, at that point, the thought was that well, she's never been in any trouble before. She'll tell us what she did with the child. - On July 16th, 2008, Casey was arrested on suspicion of child neglect, obstructing the investigation, and for lying to the police. Two cadaver dogs allegedly hit on odors found in Anthony's car. - We later discovered there were chloroform searches on the Anthony computer. - They were low levels. Consistent with cleaning products. This is the level of absurdity, the desperation that this case, that this prosecution will take it to. Year old Caylee, missing, says her mother, for at least five weeks. - As every hour passes, I get a little bit more nervous. - Both lived with Cindy Anthony, and her husband George. - That's all I'd say, we want our granddaughter. My daughter sees where she's at, we deal with that separately. - Where their daughter is, is in custody. Charged with among other things, obstructing a criminal investigation. The 22 year old single mom has repeatedly told detectives confusing stories about Caylee. - In this case, there are some time gaps when it was determined that she didn't have a job at Universal, and we don't know what Casey was doing. But with Casey now in custody and arrested on suspicion of obstructing the investigation, lying to the police, and child neglect, investigators focus on trying to find Caylee. They start by piecing together the timeline in the days leading up to Caylee going missing. According to the Orange County Sheriff's report, they were able to trace her most recent whereabouts. On Fathers Day, June 15, Caylee and Casey visit the Anthony Home. June 16 is the last day that Caylee is seen alive. On June 20th, five days after Caylee was last seen, Casey is seen out partying at Fusion night club. Over the next month, she's captured on various mall security cameras going shopping without Caylee. She also gets a new tattoo, reading bella vita, which is Italian for beautiful life. During this time, Casey had been using her parents' car, but abandons it on June 27th. On June 30th, the car was impounded, and a letter was sent to her parents. On July 15th, 31 days after Caylee was last seen, George and Cindy retrieved the car. There was a terrible odor coming from the trunk. Cindy tracks Casey down at her boyfriend, Tony Lazarro's, apartment and drags her home. And then calls the police. - There's something wrong. I found my daughter's car today, and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car. - It was the discovery of Casey's abandoned car that would lead to three key pieces of evidence for the prosecution. The odor, a single strand of Caylee's hair, and traces of chloroform found in the trunk of the car. - Two cadaver dogs allegedly hit on odors found in Anthony's car. - He alerted to the odor of human decomposition. - In the trunk of that car? - Yes ma'am. - Cuz I found hair samples in the trunk of the car that were similar in length and color to that of Caylee. - Despite not having a body, on October 14th, 2008, a 19 member Orange County grand jury met to deliberate on the largely circumstantial evidence collected against Casey Anthony. - They considered that evidence, they've deliberated, and they have returned an indictment. - Casey was arrested and charged with first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. She would later plead not guilty to all charges. - At this point, I would definitely want to learn more about the car and what was in the trunk. The prosecution claiming that multiple people, right from the start, made a point of saying that this was a decomposing dead body. It was Cindy, who was a nurse, did make a comment that it smelled like a decomposing body. When you first come into contact with the car and you saw it, what was your first impression, and your instinct, having been an experienced investigator? - Certainly, standing here helps me relive that moment. And it takes me back to that point in time. You know, I think and to put things into context, it made things much more serious. The initial allegations of simply a child abduction, or a babysitter who had taken a child. - So this car would become pivotal in this investigation and prosecution. Unfortunately, it had been in several people's hands. It had been abandoned, it had been sitting in different places. I mean, how did that affect this investigation, and this case in general? - I think it leaves the door open to be able to cast reasonable doubt. You know, I think any good defense attorney would have that ability. But I think also, contrary to that, I think that there was still plenty of evidence there. - The prosecution's theory seemed to rest heavily on the finding of chloroform in the trunk. - Yes. It's very fascinating. Especially given the volatility of the chemical. That was kind of pivotal as to what road we were going to go down. It made this a very atypical investigation. - The prosecution believed that Casey Anthony used chloroform to kill Caylee. Chloroform was once used as an anesthetic, but it's no longer used for that. It's hard to acquire, and contrary to what we've seen in the media, it's not commonly encountered in crime investigations. - Reports surfaced this week that the potentially deadly chemical chloroform was reportedly found in the trunk of her car. A drug that can cause a person to pass out and can be fatal at high doses. - We later discovered that there were chloroform searches on the Anthony computer. It's one of those critical points early on that made a suggestion that it was more than just simply an abduction. - When police searched the Anthony home following the report of Caylee's disappearance, they took the family's computer in for forensic examination. On the internet browsing history, they found several intriguing searches. - By a user in the Anthony home, searches were done on that computer for the words chloroform, alcohol, acetone, how to make chloroform. - This forms the basis of the prosecution's case. And the traces found in the trunk of the car, and the Google searches on the home computer, the prosecutor believed that the chloroform was homemade. - At the end of this case, you will have no trouble concluding that Caylee Anthony was murdered by her mother Casey Anthony. - The prosecution believed the chloroform was used to kill Caylee. The chloroform in this case created what I would call an epistemic imbalance. It was something that was believed to be very significant, because of what happened with the computer searches, and seeing that someone in the Anthony house did search for chloroform. But why use chloroform to kill a little girl? Why not just use something far more accessible? I think this was the erroneous part. They tried to make it make sense. But actually, there were numerous possibilities, which is what the defense put. - Chloroform. They were low levels. Very low levels, consistent with cleaning products. But this is the level of absurdity, the desperation that this case, that this prosecution will take it to. They'll take it to the next level. They'll ask you to see things that aren't there. - We definitely need to look into the chloroform further. I think we've got a lot more questions to ask of experts. The prosecution clearly believed that Casey made chloroform in her own home. Which begs the question whether or not someone who wasn't a chemist could actually manufacture chloroform in their own home. - So we're going to meet with Dr. Kenyon Evans, a professor of chemistry and forensic toxicology at the University of Tampa. - Can you actually buy it? Can you go anywhere to buy chloroform? - You can buy chloroform as an industrial solvent. But odds are, you're gonna produce a record for law enforcement at the least. - The chloroform evidence, and the theory around it, was actually the foundation of the prosecution's case. - But it's one of the most puzzling pieces of their narrative and this case. - So what we'd like to do is replicate a way of making it, as if it would be in someone's home. To see if that's even possible. Or if it's such a complicated process that that's not possible. - Sure. - Have you ever heard, across your career, of anyone making chloroform at home? - No. I mean, the idea that someone would try that, I don't think that's, just a personal opinion. I don't think that's completely out of this world. Like, I guess it's possible. But to my knowledge, I don't know if there's a specific case study where someone made chloroform at home for sort of nefarious, I'm gonna anesthetize someone against their will. - Well, you've never heard of a case where somebody's actually done it successfully. - That's right, that's right. - Is it really possible that Casey Anthony, a young 22 year old mother who did not graduate from high school, was capable of making chloroform? Laura and I are at the University of Tampa to meet with Dr. Kenyon Evans to test whether or not you could actually manufacture chloroform in somebody's home. This is really significant for us, because this forms the basis of the prosecution's case. - Should we try and make some first of all? - Yeah, sure. - Have you got some students that can help? - Katie, who is not a chemistry student. - Hi Katie. - And is kind enough... - Hi Katie. - Is gonna be kind enough to try a synthesis that she found online, right? - Yeah. So we'll see how this goes. - Okay, great. - The prosecution's suggestion was that Casey Anthony made chloroform, because of what happened with the computer searches, and seeing that someone in the Anthony house did search for chloroform. So we're using somebody who didn't have an understanding of science and chemistry to show just how difficult it would be to make it. - So, we'll start with bleach here. - Okay, so this is the online recipe that you found? - And then you pour acetone into the concentrated bleach. So what does it say next? - Swirl it around without sloshing it. It does say first you'll notice a white cloud of vapor coming from the solution, and the solution itself will become cloudy. You don't want to breathe this in. You'll be able to see a white residue powder or bubble forming on the bottom. That's the chloroform. - I noticed that it is getting very cloudy. - It should settle into a layer. Sort of like a vinegar and oil layer, where it's sitting on the bottom. - Right at the end it says at this point, the chloroform is created, but if you're going to use it on people or animals for that matter, it needs to be distilled in order to purify it. Obviously you'll need a distiller for that. - Yes. - Wow, that's a whole... - What's a distiller? - Complicated process. - Distillation is not trivial. It's difficult, and most people are not gonna distill. And so you're gonna have impurities in there. That's what distillation would take out. - Right. So you're basically heating it up so that certain compounds will boil off. And then what's left could be your compound, or you may have to boil off another level, and another level, and another level. It's not just mixing the chemicals. You have to extract it from the bottom of this mixture. But hen on top of that, you have to actually distill what's left to purify it. So you can use it. And certainly the average person would never be able to do that in their own home. - I mean, this sounds quite complicated. - You'd have to have a whole apparatus for it. - Yeah. - When you look online to see how do you make chloroform, if you didn't read the full recipe of what you need to do, it would seem quite simple. But actually when you read the detail of it, it's much more complicated than that. And I think this was probably the part that the jury didn't buy into. That anyone from the Anthony household was making chloroform to either render Caylee Anthony unconscious, or to kill her. And I have to say neither do I buy into that narrative, having run the real-life experiment that showed it was highly unlikely. - To manufacture, at home, chloroform effectively, and then effectively use it against somebody who's not cooperating, in your experience, it's not even possible for that to be done. - Yeah, it hasn't been seen. People have tried it from time to time. - And it's never worked. - Right. - According to the prosecution, there were three key pieces of evidence found in the trunk of Casey's car. There was a single hair, the smell of human decomposition, and high levels of chloroform. But if Casey Anthony making chloroform is highly unlikely, what else might the prosecution have gotten wrong in the case of Caylee Anthony? Coming up on The Case of Caylee Anthony They had cadaver dogs search the vehicle. What did they find? They're picking up traces of decomposition. Search warrants aren't given for cadaver dogs. It's not an exact science. A single strand of hair recovered from the trunk of Casey's car. [Jim The evidence that you had wasn't sufficient to make that determination. It's not enough. Earlier on The Case of Caylee Anthony The prosecution believed that Casey Anthony used chloroform to kill Caylee. We later discovered there were chloroform searches on the Anthony computer. But why use chloroform to kill a little girl? This is the level of absurdity that this prosecution will take it to. Have you ever heard across your career of anyone making chloroform at home? People have tried it from time to time - But it's never worked. Right. - Caylee Anthony, two years, 10 months old, she's reported missing by her mother on July 15th, 2008, a month after she's actually last seen. Investigators don't believe her. Her story has fallen through. - And Caylee Anthony is still missing at this point. There's still a search ongoing for her. But investigators believe that she has been killed. And Casey was charged with first-degree murder. And they suspect that chloroform was involved. So there's questions about whether Casey Anthony made chloroform. - We're talking about a 22-year-old girl, in a suburban home, without a chemistry set. - I don't see it. - So Laura and I actually went to the University of Tampa and set up an experiment, to see whether somebody who didn't have a background in chemistry could actually synthesize it. - But actually, to do it was quite complicated. It just seemed highly unlikely that that's what happened in this case. - Hollywood makes it look very simple to put these types of chemicals together on a rag, on someone's face. - It's a hell of a lot easier to smother a three-year-old than it is to think about how you're gonna do this elaborate way of making chloroform. - Though the prosecution theorized that Casey could've crafted her own chloroform, our experiment with Dr Kenyon shed light on the fact that someone with little to no science experience could have a very difficult time making the chemical compound at home. So if it's highly unlikely that Casey made her own chloroform, we should turn to the next critical piece of evidence, the odor in the trunk. - I found my daughter's car today, and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car. - It was the disclosure by authorities that two cadaver dogs allegedly hit on odors found in Anthony's car, which the judge said would keep him wake at night. - He alerted to the odor of human decomposition. - They had cadaver dogs search the vehicles. What did they find? - They're picking up traces of decomposition, which tells us that something just isn't right here. - Even though law enforcement cadaver dogs hit on the trunk, the source of the strong odor became one of the most controversial evidentiary questions According to the prosecution, Casey had texted a friend about the smell. - She remarked that there was a really bad smell coming out of her car, and she didn't know what it was. And then there's another phone call where she said it had gotten worse, and she thought maybe her dad had run over something when he had borrowed the car. - It seemed the prosecution argued Casey was already setting up, in advance, that when somebody smells this, I want to have an excuse for why it smells in the back of my car. - Any of us that have smelled a dead body, I mean, it is unmistakable. I mean, it's something that stays with you forever. - But I know that dead animals do smell pretty damn bad. - Well, they're different. - Well, different or more extreme? I mean... - No, different. All of us in this room have smelled a decomposing human body at some point. The human species are different in their composition... - Yeah, I understand that, but it's difficult to know. - This all started when Cindy made a comment that it smelled like a decomposing body. - It smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car. Yeah, I said it smelled like something had died in the car. - Cindy Anthony later said she had made a rush to judgment, and the stench she inhaled was likely an old pizza in the trunk. - There was a bag of pizza for, what, 12 days, in the back of the car, full of maggots. It stunk so bad. - Casey threw the garbage in the trunk of her car. And like many of us forget sandwiches and leftovers and doggy bags, she forgot to throw out the trash. That's where the smell comes from. - Because there was garbage in that trunk, a story about possibly some dead animals that could've been associated with her car. And we wanted to find out whether or not we could distinguish between cadaver dogs finding the scent of decaying trash, decaying animals or decaying humans. So we set out to conduct our own experiment at the local junkyard. Well, we're meeting up with Mike and Julie of Peace River Search and Rescue. Mike and Julie are trainers of cadaver dogs, like the ones used by police in the Anthony case. We want to find out if these dogs really can distinguish between rotting garbage, dead animals and human decomposition. - We've got some, I got a deer and a pig skull here for you. They're still generating odor. So we'll be able to use these. - So if they're, is that gonna be different from if it was a decomposing mammal? - If it still had meat and flesh on it, it would be a larger scent picture. So this will be a smaller one. But it's still generating. - But it's enough for a dog to pick up? - Absolutely. - Okay. - Yeah. - And so in there is human remains? - This is, it's got human tissue in it. I've got some jars and stuff in here for you. - And in this bag? - We've got a pizza box in here... - Clothing. - And some other random trash. - Okay, great. - And just some things in there as well. - Yes. - Yup. - Okay. - I've got gloves for you guys. We're gonna go somewhere where we don't see what you're doing. - A dog's nose has upwards of 300 million olfactory receptors. Their sense of smell is 40 times greater than a human's. Though we're placing these items in a closed trunk, we're told the animals will still be able to detect what's inside, but can they differentiate between three different kinds of decomposition? - And so what are we looking for with her? When she's alerting, what will she do? - She's a very energetic dog. So she'll be going pretty quickly here. She'll probably jump either in the vehicles or around them. If she's in a position where she can down, she will. - And what does that mean, down? - When she downs, that means that she's found odor. - Well, shall we put it to the test and see what happens? - We're ready to go. So all I'm gonna do is tell her to go find, coffa. And then she'll take off. - Okay, great. - Coffa. - Wow, she is very... - Is that her excitement? - She's very excited. Good girl. Is it okay if we open the trunk of this car? - Yeah, she's on to human remains. - That is a definite alert. She's not moving. She's not searching anywhere else. - Running a blind test and seeing Callie, the dog, at work, was just very instructive for me. But like anything, no science is perfect. So how sensitive is their sense of smell and scent? - Very sensitive, we've actually put a drop of blood inside drywall, and the dogs have been able to find that drop of blood inside the drywall. - How do you know whether he's hitting on blood that's from somebody who cut their finger when they were closing the trunk of a car or somebody who passed away? - We don't know. That's for forensics to figure that out. All I do is say there's blood there. - Let's say, if someone rests a body down in a location, and then they move the body, does it, the odor evaporates or dissipates? - Residual odor is one of the big problems that we have with cadaver dogs. And you have a body that had been left there for even a short period of time, like a couple of hours, it will leave a scent picture there that the dogs can detect. Now some people would call that a false positive, because there's no body there, but with the cadaver dog, there could be something there. We just don't know what it is, or we can't see it. So it is a problem. That's one of the reasons why search warrants aren't given just for cadaver dogs, because it's not an exact science. - Our experiment showed the cadaver dog was not distracted by garbage or dead animals when searching for human remains, which is what the prosecution stated. But as we were told, it's not an exact science. - There are things called false positives. The reliability of this dog is questionable. - The prosecution has built their case on circumstantial evidence collected from the trunk, which under closer examination is proven to be less than reliable. But there's one more piece of evidence from the car that we need to consider. Another key piece of evidence found in the trunk was a nine-inch hair, the prosecution claiming the hair may have come from a decomposing body. - The evidence that you had wasn't sufficient to make that determination. - It's not enough. Investigators believ Casey's abandoned car holds important clues. - This investigation involves intricate forensics that are on the cutting edge of science. - One key piece of key scientific evidence, a single strand of hair recovered from the trunk of Casey's car. Investigators say that it showed signs of decomposition, meaning that it came from a dead body. - They took hair from the trunk. They took hair from the trash bag. They took hair from Casey's clothes. They took hair from her home. And what's more important is they cannot say it came from a dead body. - Among all the hair collected from the trunk of Casey's car, forensic investigators found just a single hair that showed signs of postmortem banding. This led law enforcement to believe that a dead body had been in the trunk. However, recent scientific developments called into question the science that this claim is based on. - We wanted to meet with Dr De Forest, an independent expert and specialist in postmortem banding, in order to discuss the claims about the strand of hair collected from Casey's car. - So Dr Forest, we're actually conducting a reexamination of the death of Caylee Anthony. And part of that investigation includes one hair that they said has evidence of decomposition. And I believe that's called postmortem banding. - Yeah, it's evidence of decomposition taking place in the follicle. - Have you testified in cases about postmortem banding and identified cases in which hair must have been, in your opinion, in the head of a person after they died? - Yes, whether the body or, like at the wood chipper case in Connecticut where the guy put the woman through the wood chipper, and there were little bits of scalp that were all set out in the ground. There were about 1,000 hairs they brought me, and all of those showed the postmortem root banding. So it's the decomposition taking place within the follicle. - So can you perhaps show us what the death banding looks like on a hair? - Yup, this one here, I think is a nice one to show this. So we have this just dark band, which is an area where there's material missing from the inside of the hair. - And how long would you say, after somebody has died, would you expect to see this dark banding? - This doesn't happen, you know, overnight. Two to three days is what I would commonly see with normal root banding. - And so in our case, if we can relate it to the facts here, is that what you were talking about there? - This hair was found in the trunk of the car. - If I were to opine on something that looked like that, I would say that this is a typical postmortem root banding, but it's not absolute. One of my former students has done some experiments where in the laboratory he can change the pH and put in certain solutions and actually create something that looks like that. - So postmortem banding isn't really definitive? - It is not, no. - The further we dig into the evidence surrounding the car, the less convincing the prosecution's So we called in someone who knows firsthand some of the challenges with the prosecution's case. - Casey Anthony, in jail, her lawyer has assembled high-profile experts, including Dr Henry Lee. - With 56 years of experience and having worked cases all around the world, Dr. Lee is a renowned forensic scientist. During the original investigation, Jose Baez and the defense sought his expert opinion on the case of Caylee Anthony. - This is a replica of the make and model of the car that Casey Anthony drove. - Yeah, I remember. - Does this bring back any memories for you? - I remember. 10 years ago, - When you examined the vehicle in the Casey Anthony case, where was that vehicle? - The vehicle is in the police department garage. - Still, in November? - Still. - What kind of odor? - When you say typical, what do you mean? - So garbage, not human decomposition? - When the trunk was popped, what did you see? - So the glue that was used to hold the carpeting, you're saying that could be responsible... - Is it possible, after everything, the chloroform came from the trunk liner? The prosecution said that one hair that was found in the trunk, in the original search, appeared to have postmortem banding. Generally, when we see postmortem banding, it occurs while the hair is still attached to the head of somebody who is decomposing. - Right. - So we've learned that death banding characteristics can present in a hair when subjected to unique conditions. And of course, this conflicts with the prosecution's assertion that it can only happen when attached to a dead body. Do you think it's unusual that there was just one hair? - So it doesn't tell you one way or the other. To be, it'll present itself out in court, and it will withstand the rigors of cross-examination. And everyone shouldn't jump to conclusions and automatically conclude that a person's guilty until proven innocent. - The closer we look at the evidence from the trunk, the weaker the case seems. None of the evidence links directly to Casey. But the prosecution included first-degree murder charges. At this point, the search for Caylee has reached critical mass. The EquuSearch organization has hundreds of volunteers combing the area where Caylee was reportedly last seen. - A total of 2,500 volunteer searchers from 14 states braved mosquitoes, high water and soaring temperatures to try to find Caylee Anthony. - We're not gonna give up, folks. - The head of EquuSearch says standing water from Tropical Storm Fay is making it impossible to search thoroughly. - My God, let's have this water dry up. Let's have it go away, because it's impossible to complete these areas. - The odds of finding the toddler alive, at this point, are almost nonexistent. - Sheriff Kevin Berry says if Casey Anthony wants to provide information, he could have EquuSearch back in 24 hours. - And if she's got information, it's probably best to come clean with it. - With authorities desperate for leads, they again turn to Casey for answers. Immediately following her arrest, in October, 2008, Casey was brought to the Orange County Sheriff's Office, instead of the jail, in order to give her the opportunity to tell the FBI, once and for all, anything she knew about Caylee's disappearance. - So how was she acting after her arrest, considering the magnitude of the charges against her? We want to take a look at the video footage to examine Casey's behavior, given the context that her daughter has now been missing for four months. - Let's have a look and see what happens. - I have to use the restroom, so if you'll give me a minute... - That's fine. - And then we'll get you phone, and we will call your attorney. - Okay. - Okay? - We have a surveillance video from the Sheriff's Office of Casey making small talk with FBI agents as she waited for her lawyer, Jose Baez. We're going to analyze the tape with Jim Fitzgerald and Nick Savage, who was at the Sheriff's Office that day. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - She says, "My daughter," but you don't get, you get distance from it. You don't get a connection from it. It's almost like she's talking about somebody else. It's not her reality and the fact she's being charged for first-degree murder. - Of that same daughter. - Of that same daughter. - She's just been charged with a crime that could potentially carry the death penalty. So that's you entering the scene. - I am. - What is your intention here? - I certainly just want the opportunity to talk to her. I'll be honest with you. It's about looking for a little girl. And it may pay off. It may be effective. - Obviously, it was a custodial situation, so nothing we're gonna talk about is gonna be used against her. - However, I guess, there is a remote possibility, even though she had been charged with the murder of her child, that maybe she would come out and say something about where Caylee is actually located right now. Perhaps that thin slice of hope that she's even still alive. And you wouldn't really care if that could be held against her in court or not. - The defense will later claim that Casey actually went into extreme denial. - Casey did what she's been doing all her life, hiding her pain. She went back to that deep, ugly place called denial, to pretend as if nothing was wrong. Something's not right with this girl. - They argued that Caylee was the love of her life. And the fact that Casey knew she was gone meant that she couldn't face life in that reality. - We had a discussion. - Okay. - You're gonna discuss that with her? - Um, she knows. - Okay. - And I have to say, she's incredibly polite. - She's very conscious of her interaction with everybody. And she does come across... - Yeah, she's very charming. She is. - It's all just inherent to her personality. - The prosecution believes strongly in her guilt. But you have to explain the cause of death in a homicide. And they didn't have a body. They took a risk, including a charge of first-degree murder. But did they have the direct evidence linking Casey to the crime? - With regret, I'm here to inform you that the skeletal remains are those of the missing toddler, Caylee Anthony. - It was a cold day. The bag was in place. You could see the skull. You could see the duct tape. I could shut my eyes and go back there today as if it were yesterday. - Casey Anthony was charged in the death of Caylee Anthony, despite no weapon, no motive and no body. Two months later, December the 11th, 2008, sadly, Caylee Anthony's remains are found in a wooded area, a quarter of a mile from the Anthony home, in Suburban Drive. - Today, investigators are still examining the remains of a small child found near Caylee's home. - Investigators tell NBC news they have a high degree of confidence the body found in the woods is Caylee Anthony. - With regret, I'm here to inform you that the skeletal remains found on December 11th are those of the missing toddler, Caylee Anthony. - Nick, can you just tell us where exactly were you. So presumably, you got a phone call that Caylee was found. - John Allen called me. I almost halfheartedly, at the time, said, "John, we've been through this so many times." And he said, "No, I think you really need "to get down here as soon as possible." The thing I remember most about it was it was a cold day. I mean, it was freezing, and it was raining. It was just a cold rain that kind of slipped right through you. And I can remember kind of walking up on the scene and then just kind of looking down. I swear everything was magnified, the sounds, the... everything. - So you saw the bones in place? - The bag was in place. You could see the skull. You could see the duct tape. Again, I could shut my eyes and go back there today as if it were yesterday. - Going back to the place where Caylee Anthony's remains were discovered, now this is about a quarter of a mile away from the Anthony home, in a wooded area, off of Suburban Drive. All the while, during the course of the missing person investigation, she was around the corner, close to the main road, and yet they didn't find her. - In the FBI behavioral analysis unit, we immediately search concentric circles around the last known sighting area. And they didn't do that in this case. Nick, we've done hundreds, if not thousands, of child abduction investigations over the course of our career, and you search every house and every child-sized container, and you focus on abandoned houses, right, and wooded areas. - Yes, we certainly know within a one-mile radius is generally where a body would be left. And then a lot of those areas were searched. But from the initial start of this investigation, we were looking for potentially a child that had been abducted, not necessarily one that could've been in that field. - Right, and what we had heard was that the Sheriff's Department relied heavily on volunteers, none of which were really trained in search of a decomposed child. - Correct. - We think it was the perfect storm, because Casey led the police investigation far away to Sawgrass Apartments, where the nanny supposedly lived, and said that's where Caylee was last seen. And so from the beginning, investigators were misdirected. And then in December we learn that Roy Kronk, the witness who located Caylee's remains, actually had found her remains in August, four months earlier. - The mystery man who found Caylee Anthony's body has gone public. Roy Kronk, a water meter reader for Florida's Orange County, spoke out after Caylee's remains were identified. - I discovered and reported to my management and appropriate authorities the remains of a human body located in a wooded area. Back in August of this year, I had previously reported to Crimeline and to the sheriff's communication center that I had spotted something suspicious, a bag in the same area. - So Roy Kronk calls up three times in August. Why wasn't her body found? At this point, I would definitely want to learn more about Roy Kronk. He claimed that they stopped in the area, Suburban Drive, and he needed to go into the woods to relieve himself. He says that's when he first saw the skull. He then found this rattlesnake, and so he and his colleagues kind of got wrapped up with this dead snake, and so they went back to work, taking the snake with them to sort of scare their colleagues. But his girlfriend appeals to his conscience that you should call the police. - A deputy goes out on August the 11th, after work. He goes up through some of the grass verge area. He says he can't see anything, and he drives off. And so Roy Kronk does call again the next day. - Looking through the police reports, police did respond this time but could not see Caylee's body, either. They placed a call to headquarters and were then told that the area had already been searched. - Such a damned shame. They missed such an opportunity, because there's a high likelihood, at this point, that they're searching for a body, not a live child who's lost. - That's the travesty of it. On his third try, Roy Kronk went to meet police and show them where the body was. - The worst part of this is that on August the 13th, two officers did respond and meet Kronk there. The deputy started to go down the hill a little bit, slipped and fell and decided I'm not interested in going any further. - You said that he just did a cursory sort of looking around, didn't do much of anything. - Yes, ma'am. - And then proceeded to either argue with you or berate you about why you were wasting his time or the county's time? - Yes, he was berating me. - And because of how you were treated, you let the matter go. - Yes, ma'am. - Three times, back in August, Roy Kronk called investigators to report a suspicious bag in the woods. - We'll get to the bottom of it. - The sheriff says an internal investigation is now underway to answer why detectives missed those critical clues. - Well, maybe they just weren't thinking like that. I mean, at the time, she's a missing person. They think that they're searching for a little toddler, alive. - They had a responsibility to find out, rather than just making assumptions and then discounting a sighting that was so close to her house and turns out to be absolutely credible. The chances of that child being alive, I mean, of kids who are abducted and killed, 44% are killed in the first hour. That officer didn't know that. - We're headed to the site where Caylee's body was found to try and understand how the police could have missed discovering her body for six months. So given the fact we know that Kronk did try and call this in three times, I mean, what would the advice have been or your thoughts around that and the FBI? - Well, certainly, if they had told us that, we would've advised the officers to go and do a forensics search of that area. If it's a swampy area, then we would've had them pump out the water and actually look. I think if they had listened to Kronk, there would've been so much more forensic evidence available. - Would've changed everything. - I'm really looking forward to seeing the actual site. - It'd be great to talk to Detective Allen, just about what that area looked like. - Hi, how are you? - How you doing? Thanks for bringing us here. - It's been 10 years, but this is pretty similar to what it looked like the day we got here. - Was this sort of a natural pathway out here? - Yeah. No, I think this has probably been made. Over the years, there have been, well, you see the cross. For years, people come out here and been putting mementos and stuff out here. - Who put the cross up, in particular? Was it the family? - I don't know. I mean, people from all over have come, and, you know, there have been several different shrines put here throughout the 10 years... - Really? - Since she was found. - Walking up to the recovery site was nothing like what I expected to find from the pictures. This was an area where people would throw their trash. And so understanding this little girl, her body was placed in this area, or even possibly thrown, made me feel very upset. I certainly think, too often, that professionals can get caught in the process of trying to join all the dots up for it to make sense, rather than really think about why you're doing what you're doing. Caylee Anthony lost her life in tragic circumstances. This was a little girl who would've been 13 today, a teenager. She was left along in a wooded area and disposed of like rubbish, like garbage. So what strikes me, John, is that it's just much closer to the road than what I initially thought - There's sort of like water lines on some of these trees. This is an area that appears to fill with water. It's very swampy. You know, you can see where the roots are grown out of the ground. You know, that typically happens in a swampy area. That would have been pretty good concealment. - Yeah. - One good thing about going to see this site, at this time of year, in December, is that it mirrors when the body was actually discovered. In December, the foliage is much less abundant. Therefore, you have a clearer view of that area. The fact is, during June and July, when the body was most likely placed there, it was much more overgrown, and most likely, there was standing water in that area. You know, even with six to 10 inches of water, this would've been really marshy and just kind of foreboding. In other words, I don't, I now understand why a cop might not get out of his car and say, "You know, it's just a trash dump. "I know, I've seen trash there all my life." - It's really, I mean, we picked up a lot of trash out here, during the search. Even now, you'll see where people begun dumping trash out here again. - It's pretty clear that this place has a history. I mean, I'm looking here. There's a plastic bag here, buried under a bunch of debris, you know, which I didn't even notice when I walked by the first time. - You know, in the summertime, when it's grown up and wet here, you could be standing literally on top of it and not see it. - Summer's the rainy season, in this part of Florida. And in addition, there was a tropical storm in August, 2008. So it makes sense that there would be standing water during the summer months. It's a reasonable possibility, especially if it's the summer and there's water in there, whoever did this could've gone down just a few steps before you get down to the elevation where and easily just tossed it in. And just the fact that they were removed from it, probably means that any searchers at the time would've done the same thing. They would've stopped before the water's edge, and a dark plastic bag, in mucky, muddy, leafy, swampy water, would just disappear. Had it not been for the persistence of Kronk, she would never have been found. - This is exactly why going out to a scene tells you so much more about what has gone on than just from looking at the pictures. We've learned that it was an area with standing water. And the fact that Caylee's remains were found outside and exposed to the elements for six months means that critical evidence significantly deteriorated. And this evidence could well have been instructive in determining how Caylee Anthony died. - The body disposal site was so close to the neighborhood where the Anthonys live. I mean, literally, to be just beyond the backyard of the last house in the neighborhood. - That was astounding. - Yeah. - I mean, I had no sense of that before. - When I consulted this case as part of the FBI's behavioral analysis unit, I was working in Virginia. I had never visited the scene where her body was recovered. I didn't realize, one, the desolation of it, and two, how close it was to the home where she grew up and lived. It was literally just beyond the backyard of the last house in her neighborhood. - Jim and I went out to look at the scene itself with Sergeant John Allen, one of the sergeants who worked on this case. - And literally, what struck us the most was the location. - The recovery site itself was by the roadside. Caylee's remains were missed, because they wouldn't be looking for a skeleton at that time. - It wasn't just like walking through and suddenly there was a crime scene. That area was almost jungle-like, heavy foliage, and I don't think it was underwater at the time when Caylee's remains were initially placed there. I think it was only subsequent to some of the tropical storms that had rolled through where that land did in fact become underwater. - There was a tropical storm, Storm Fay, that hit pretty hard. - Correct. - And it seems that it was significantly underwater at that time. - EquuSearch instructed its people not to search any area that had standing water, because it's a danger for them to do so. This area clearly is one in which water would pool. Law enforcement relied on the EquuSearch results. They did not go back and research areas that they said they already searched. Kronk called in, in August. An officer responded, but Caylee's remains appeared to have been there at the time, by all accounts, and yet, they did not recover her remains then. - Maybe the deputy does, you know, have a look, but a cursory look, from the verge. We have to also remember that a body wouldn't be preserved in the same way. There would have been decomposition. - Looking at a skull in that environment, it took weeks for a team of trained forensic anthropologists to, in essence, excavate that scene, doing really an archeological, layer-by-layer evaluation to figure out exactly what was there, how big it was, the full skeleton. - Now it's one of the biggest challenges, particularly with a child. And when decomposition can set in, they might be thinking they're looking for the body of a little girl, rather than looking for something much smaller, the human remains. - I believe whoever threw her body in that location threw her into standing water, hoping that it would decay faster and that maybe animal activity would increase the fact that her body is easily disposed of. Before Caylee's remains were found, the prosecution was hanging their case on evidence collected from the trunk. Scientists believe they'd identified the presence of chloroform, the smell of decomposition and a single hair exhibiting death banding. But all of this was circumstantial and the subject of intense disagreement. But now they have a body, and with it, significant new evidence. - Tomorrow, on The Case of: Caylee Anthony. - Cause of death will be listed as homicide by undetermined means. There wasn't one piece of duct tape placed over Caylee's face; there were three. Why use duct tape? Anybody could actually reach across and just smother a child like this. If Caylee had decomposed all over that duct tape, there would have been cell material on there. There would have been some DNA. Did you travel to a hotel for the purposes of taking your own life? -Yes, sir. Suicide letter... He goes into questions. Who placed her there? Why is she gone? They told us, "You got it all. It's all there." Later we learned they missed a computer search the day that Caylee disappeared. We may have been dead before we started.
