[dramatic music] ♪♪ - It's not unusual these days to meet an airline pilot who has flown tens of thousands of hours and never lost an engine or had a contrary airplane. That was not Bob's work. He bumped into lots of contrary airplanes. On some occasions, he was able, through trickery and deception, to get it safely back on Earth. On other occasions, unable to convince them of their errant ways, he was forced, reluctantly, to part company while bidding them a fond adieu. [laughter and applause] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - They got Montgomery first. I tried to go for the 190, but my external tank wouldn't release. And now it was causing nothing but drag. Even at full throttle, I could only go 220 miles an hour. German airplane was capable of going 350 miles an hour. I had so much drag that my only defense was to turn tight. They would come in at me too fast, then I'd do this, and they'd go right by me. I was watching in the mirror because they were making passes at me. But I got hit a few times, and it sounds like hailstones on a tin roof. You can hear, in the cockpit, above your engine noise, and I could see holes in my wings. And finally I got a blast-- that engine just blew up on me. And I got hit from a fella that was way out here all by himself. And I thought, "Well, he doesn't have a chance. There's no way he could hit me." But he was one of the most famous deflection shots in the German Air Force. He had 7-0, 70 spitfires to his credit. - The history of guys like Bob Hoover is an inspiring story, that is less well known to kids growing up today. - You've flown this, haven't you'? - Yes, sir. - Bob Hoover is one of the heroes of that generation for many, many reasons. - His generation of aviators set the standards. - In terms of our mission here at the museum, every airplane in here, in this collection, has a unique story. It's in the collection because it did something unique in the history of aviation and space. - His history of the things that he's done and the circumstances under which he's done them are what make him the pilot's pilot that he is. Also, I've seen him as a remarkable resource for others. - I don't think I'd be alive today if Bob didn't take me under his wings 24, 25 years ago... - Here's our friend, Sean. -And make sure I played by a certain set of rules. I had a lot of passion, and I had pretty good skill sets. I didn't know where the box was. Don't push it over that edge. Smoke's comin' on now. Here we go. He still tells me when he thinks I'm pushing the envelope too much. - Critical altitude... 800 feet. Half roll, turn inverted, Now we're going negative! Without mentorship, without people who care, I wouldn't have made it. Mr. R.A. "Bob" Hoover, how are you, my friend? - Hello, Sean D. Tucker, how are you, my friend? - I'm great. - Nothing equals either combat or experimental flying. And there's something about risk-taking, that you don't think anything's going to ever happen to you. It just only happens to other people. You like to think that, "I'm smarter than the airplane is, "and I'll know how to handle whatever situation comes my way." That isn't always the case. If you have a malfunction at the wrong place at the wrong time, you're dead. - Okay, you're observing the entry to a spin test. And the objective was to decrease the airspeed at the rate of one knot per second... until the airplane was fully stalled, at which time the controls had to he placed in the cross-control position, full right rudder and full left aileron with the stick pulled back. As you can see, the airplane developed into a flat spin initially. The sensation within the cockpit is one of spinning about an axis, ahead of the airplane, though that's not really the case, as you can see here. The smoke that you just observed are the rockets that are used to try and stop the rotation. Now you are seeing the drag chute, or spin recovery chute, which was totally ineffective, as well as the rockets. This spin continued for 22 consecutive turns with different control applications, as well as the recovery techniques described. At approximately 10,000 feet above the terrain, I ejected, and you can see the parachute blossomed up there. And you got to he prepared for that split-second judgment that is necessary to stay alive. [explosion] And so has it been with the air show work. There were many times I was just plain lucky 'cause whatever happened, happened at exactly the right place and the right time. I had to have the right circumstances to have survived. Sometimes you do have the right circumstances, and sometimes you don't. - Malfunction here was a bolt had fallen out on the left wheel. It was frozen in the "up" position. I had the left half of the runway foamed down so that I could keep the right wheel on the dry surface for braking purposes. And the intent was to land it as slow as possible. There's the power going off. You can see the blades begin to change their speed. You can see that here's heavy braking going on because the tail is still in the air even though the wing's down. And at that point, of course, I couldn't hold it any longer. That's one of the lectures I give to the graduating classes of the test pilot school: Think outside of the box. You've learned everything you can learn in school. But remember, when lightning strikes, you never know where it's gonna hit. Think outside of the box. - What were you thinking about making that last approach? - Well, only about as little damage as possible to my great little airplane. - Did you really never think about the damage that might happen to you'? - Well, I've been a test pilot all my life, and you don't dwell on those thoughts. - Was this the closest call you we had in a long time or what? - No, not really. - This is, uh -- this is steel forged in the cauldron of war and a whole different experience than I've ever had. And you live a lot closer to this stuff than I do. I sit and listen to you. I've never, you know-- How many engine failures have you had? - Too many. - And how many times have you bailed out of an airplane or c--had been-- crashed an airplane? Much less, you know, bailed out of it, you crashed? I've got 4,500 hours, and I've only crashed twice. - You're perfect. [laughter] - But--But I'm-- I'm never gonna know the experiences that you've had and that you've had 'cause you do this on purpose. You just can't get to be a Bob Hoover anymore. - I don't think you can get to be a Bob Hoover anymore. There's never gonna be another Bob Hoover. [plane flying] - I like the sound cue on the end of that. [chuckles] [militaristic music] - We won't see another Bob Hoover. Bob has spanned generations of pilots. He's been everything from military to test to business to air show. A good businessman himself. You're not likely to find anyone who can fill all those categories again and so importantly. He's been sent all over the world by our State Department, by the military, to specifically perform at air shows, interact with other countries and other pilots, and it's unlikely you'll find anyone with all of those skills again. - This is the Rockwell Shrike Commander. An airplane that was not designed for aerobatics, it's designed as a business/pleasure aircraft, seating seven people. And here you're observing an 8-point roll. And this is being accomplished with both engines feathered and, uh, stopped, and you'll see the propeller standing, streamlined into the wind, or feathered. - For the crowd, Bob adds a touch of humor with what he calls his Tennessee Waltz maneuver. With landing gear and flaps down, he makes an approach known to pilots as a Falling Leaf side slip. This sort of thing is usually done only in fighter planes. - Well, there's a lot of swagger out among the fighter pilot community, and a lot of people claim to be the world's greatest fighter pilot. They have on their name tag "Joe Blow, WGFP." Well, Bob Hoover was the world's greatest fighter pilot. - Bob is famous for his demonstrations of conserving energy in an airplane with the engines shut down purposefully, flight maneuvers in which he creates airspeed and translates that into altitude and then continues to manipulate those two factors. - By energy management, I mean, you're pulling the airplane up, and you want it to go over the top like this. He knows just when that moment is, so it doesn't stall and come back down like this. And he get on the ragged edge better than anyone that I've ever seen. - He was a god to a lot of us younger fighter pilots. He did so much for the flying game in general, the Air Force in particular, that he's looked on as a god. - The lessons that I took from him and also the lessons that the nation took from him-- And this is really important-- Energy management is the secret to aerial combat. The pilot who can maintain his energy level--speed usually-- At the higher level is probably gonna win. And so how do you do that? And that was what he was working on back in the '40s. - Well, now, TOPGUN and the Fighter Weapons School and all these things that have come recently train pilots to think like that. - And have to pick Bob Hoover's brains about what he did as a test pilot. And I'll tell you, some of his stories, you know, you could make a documentary of Bob Hoover that would last for a lifetime and still not hear all the stories. - And along with that, he was a great personality. You could sit down and have as good a time with Bob Hoover at a lunch and two or three martinis and then go back to work and do some serious good stuff. And he just was the all-American boy, you know. His story is in itself just an absolutely epic story. - Nobody's ever done what Hoover's done in an airplane. - oh, I would suppose that my interest in becoming a fighter pilot was motivated by things I had read about World War I. And each time I did see an airplane, and there weren't too many flying back in those days, I'd stop whatever I was doing to watch it until it went out of sight. AM I could think about or want to read about would be airplanes and aviation. In the wintertime, I would go around the neighborhood and stoke fires. They had coal furnaces, and a big old coal bin in the basement. And then on the weekends, I was working in a grocery store, 16 hours a day to earn $2. I was so eager about flying that I felt my parents would not want to know about it because my parents had not even let me drive their car. I could get 15 minutes of flying time with an instructor for $2. Took that first ride, and I felt devastated when I became ill from air sickness. But I overcame it, and I had learned to fly by the time they found out about it. Back then, I was so naive that I didn't know what structures meant or the limitations on an airplane. You just assumed, if an airplane flies, you could do anything with it. That's not really true. It's very easy to overstress a light airplane. Chandelles - where they teach you to pull up like this and make a steep turn and drop your nose down like that. And I kept doing that because it made me uncomfortable. And eventually I thought, "Well, I'll go one step further "and all the way up to here, why can't I just roll through?" And I'd keep working at it. And it resulted in my being way ahead of myself and most other people back then who were flying. - I have to be honest with you, I didn't even know where Pearl Harbor was. I was at that time about 19. My orders had some through to go to military flight training, so off I went. I got to primary flight training, and the instructor was giving me an orientation flight. And he said, "Would you like to see a roll?" And I said, "Yes, sir." And so he did a roll, then said to me, "Do you think you'd like to try that?" And I said, "Yes, sir." And so I did a perfect roll for him, and he shook his head. He said, "Where did you learn to do that?" And I said, "I taught myself." And he said, "What else can you do?" And I said, "Well, I can slice it into a pie." And he said, "What do you mean?" And I said, "Well, instead of just going around, "I can stop it anywhere I want to, and I can do four points or eight points or whatever you want." And he said, "Show me," and so I did. And he said, "How about loops?" And I said, "Yes, sir." "How about spins?" And I said, "Oh, I can do those too," so I did them all for him. He got on the ground and went into the commandant, and he said, "I've got a problem with one of my students." And he said, "Well, just wash him out." He said, "But, sir, you don't understand, he can fly better than I can or any instructor we have here." And so he said, "Let him teach the instructors." For the rest of primary, that's all I did. [applause] - It has been hectic. He was only supposed to be here till 3:00, but he agreed to stay till 4:00, and the line has moved right on through. He's been wonderful, taking photographs. They really appreciate what he stands for and what he does. - He's like God to us older guys. - Yeah. - This is a picture of when I came to Oshkosh, about eight years old with my four brothers. - When I was seven years old, my dad took me to an air show, and Bob Hoover flew there. I didn't really get what it was, but I knew it was big. I knew it was important. Anyway, he signed this for me in 1970. My dad was a pilot, inspired me to be a pilot. - Bob is considered to be a pilot's pilot. So out of all the gentlemen that are here that I'd like to meet, he absolutely is one that I wanted to meet personally and hope that some of that luck would rub off if I shake his hand on the stick. - His accomplishments in aviation, you know, one after the other and the way, you know, he can tell all these fantastic stories, you know, it's truly fant-- you know, not enough superlatives left. - Absolute perfection. God given. I'm the one who asked the question, "Do you believe in divine intervention?" [inspirational music] ♪♪ - And then when I got ready to get my license, I was told, 'Your eyes aren't good enough. You can't fly." Nowadays, you can be a fighter pilot wearing glasses, and nobody thinks anything of it. But back than, it wasn't that way, and I it worked out that I ran into the right kind of a doctor who said, "I've been watching you fly, young man. "I'm gonna be gone for about 20 minutes, "and when I come back, you better read that second line from the bottom." And so he left, and I memorized that line real quick. [laughs] He returned, and he said, "Now, if anybody ever wants "to dilate the pupils of your eyes, "you tell them that you're allergic to the medication, and they won't find out." But he said, "I'm convinced you will turn out someday "to be a very good pilot, and I want to be able to say I helped you." [dramatic music] ♪♪ - Tall pilots above 6 feet went to transports or bombers. And if you were short, you'd go to fighters because the cockpits were a bit smaller. So I went through twin engine training. But I wasn't happy. I wanted to be a fighter pilot. There was one of the short fellas, and he was bemoaning the fact to me that he really wanted to be a transport pilot. And I said, "I've got an idea. Do you have $10?" "I've got $10." "And let's go talk to the sergeant in personnel "who makes up the orders. "I've heard that he really likes his beer. He said, "You got a deal." I got to this fighter unit where they were training down in Florida, been there a very short time, and I was flying a P-39. I had an engine blow up on me, and so I called my Mayday, and I tom them what runway I was choosing. As soon as I stopped, I started running because it was really a pretty bad fire by then. The plane was never flyable again, it was burned up so bad. Three days later, we were going in on a water slick. I was number one going in on the target, and about that time, my engine blew up. And I thought, "Well, it was just another engine failure." So I decided I've got to ditch. And I was underwater just as quick as you can blink an eye. And I inflated my Mae West. Thank goodness it brought me right to the surface. And we fished the airplane out, and it was full of bullet holes from one end to the other. The number two person in my flight, he was looking at the target, and he didn't see me. He was shooting at the target, and he shot me down. And then suddenly, we got the orders that we were going to New York, and they wouldn't tell us where we were going. So I got the orders, and it said I was in charge of 67 fighter pilots. 20 years of age, I took 67 fighter pilots, and we headed for England. - Bob and I were both flying sergeants in the Air Force. To get into flying training, you had to have two years of college, and we didn't have that. We had high school educations, so they passed a law just before World War ll broke out that, if you were a mechanic in the Air Force, you could go into pilot training right along with the cadets-- the same courses, same everything, but we graduated as sergeants rather than lieutenants. We would go out and fly all day, do the same thing that the officers did, and then we'd have to go in and wash the pots and pans, what they call "pulling KP." We'd have to do that at night, so we did that for a few months. It, uh, it taught us a Mot of humility, and we were very-- We were an enthusiasm: group that was so happy just to be flyingthat: it was worth all the things that we had tn go through to live through it. - At that point, we had no American airplanes, and the colonel I checked in with didn't know what to do with us. And he put us up in Quonset huts. They had an old iron stove, but you'd be cold on the other side of the place we were in. It was just miserable. I asked the colonel, "Can't you find some kind of place "for us to get to fly with the British? They probably need pilots." Sure enough, we were trucked over to this base. And we flew out of grass fields. We didn't have runways. Our orders came, and off we went to Africa. [militaristic music] ♪♪ - The person I reported to at headquarters in Iran, one of the first places we invaded in North Africa-- When I checked in with these 67 pilots, they put us in tents. And, buy, it was very primitive, I mean, just really down to the basics. Some major came to me, and he said, 'We've got an assignment for you." And I said, 'Well, where am I going? Which fighter group am I going to?" He said, "You aren't. You're going to be assigned to a depot." And I thought to myself, "What is a depot?" And a depot is where they repair battle-damaged airplanes, or, in this case, assemble the airplanes because if we're bringing fighters overseas in crates on ships. And my assignment, which was distressful to me because I wanted combat, is to fly those airplanes after they were assembled. It was almost an impossible situation. Shipload after shipload. The Arabs were doing the assembly work and only a handful of inspectors. The language barrier-one accident right after the other because of mistakes that these people would make in putting the airplanes together. And you could inspect them all you wanted to, but you can't see the guts of the airplane unless you have it naked, taken all the cowlings off and look at every little detail. Gear failures were frequently a problem, and that would end up having to belly the airplane in. And a lot of people think, "Oh, that's very difficult." Well, it became routine because I had so many gear failures. I had so many engine failures. Every two or three days, I'd have an engine failure. And we had to demonstrate those airplanes as if they were going into combat. We had to fire the guns and drop the bombs if that was the case. - And there's something that's unsaid here in the story of Bob Hoover flying freshly assembled airplanes. He wasn't just doing one or two a day. I can imagine he was doing 10 or 12 or 15 a day. That's how fast they needed airplanes. They had-they didn't know how to read plans, and they just could be shown, "Okay, put this bolt in there and connect up this fuel line. "And here's how the flight controls worked," and things like that. And so that's-- you're almost built in to have a certain number of failures. - The freedom he had to just do what he wanted to do with them too. He'd test them, make sure the airplanes were okay, but then he could spend 15 minutes or whatever doing what he wanted to do. Like, for instance, he got where he could do loops and with a target on the ground and shoot the target every time he came around the loop and hit the target. And that's not easy to do, because normally when you do a loop, you kind of go like this You go forward, because you're going faster down here and slower up here. So to make it round, you have to fly longer up here and then come around. - That experience of Bob's, working on depot airplanes, probably helped him a great deal to prepare himself for his later career as a test pilot, even though the one thing that he really wanted to do was fly combat missions. [militaristic music] ♪♪ - I reported in to Palermo, Sicily, and when I arrived, they were flying Mk IX Spitfires. Well, it was he greatest dog fighter in the world but didn't have range like the Mustang later on. It was an island defender. It was an airplane that didn't have enough fuel to go very far into enemy territory, but could it ever fight. I was flying three missions a day. And I would take anybody's flight-- I didn't drink back in those days-- and I would go around when I could see them drinking too much, and I would say, "Hey, Charlie. Why don't I take that early morning mission for you?" ♪♪ - The missions we ran there, if your airplane wasn't back on the ground in an hour and 15 minutes, you were lost at sea. It was that far over to Southern France, and it was still held and occupied by the Germans. And you'd get over there, and you'd have 15 minutes to get your targets, and we were shooting up trains and airfields. And we'd count noses. Boy, you would check your watch, and you'd know how many you'd lost in a matter of 15 minutes. If they weren't on the ground at a certain time, they were down at sea somewhere. We were now using the airplane as a dive-bomber with only a 100-pound bomb on each wing. The way we would dive-bomb was to go absolutely vertical. All you'd have to do is turn a little bit to keep the ship as your target. On this particular mission where I was shot down, we had just dropped our bombs and pulled off the target. And I looked up and I saw four Focke-Wulf 190s, one of the best German reciprocating engine fighters they had at the time. Once the war was over, people asked me, "Why were you so friendly with the Germans after the war?" I said, "They were fighting for their country just as religiously as I fought for mine." My brother was over in England, and I thought, "Gee whiz, you know, that was a hell of a thing to do." But that's what war is all about. You got to do what you have to do. But it wasn't a pleasant experience. I was out about 20 miles at sea, off the coast of Nice, France. They were searching for one of their pilots. I'd been in the water for hours. We went from there into Frankfurt. This was the interrogation center for German prisoners. American captured prisoners of Germans, And you were put in solitary, and you had very little to eat. You were as hungry as could be and no medical attention. The minor wounds I had were becoming seriously infected, and getting worse every day. It was nighttime all the time. They wanted to break you down. From the interrogation center I went to the Stalag Luft 1, which was up on the Baltic Sea. And, boy, you talk about cold. Ooh, the winters were mid. Once I got into that prison camp, I got medical attention. There were people in there that just break your heart. I was put in a bed between two fellas. One of them had lost a leg and the other one lost his eye and part of his jaw. The wounds that I had, had just become big old giant looking ugly wounds. The blood poisoning goes down your legs from wherever the wounds are. When they tell you about what can happen next, it starts really getting your attention. I fully recovered from it and I--thank goodness. [laughs] - Bob always had a goal in anything he did, and when he became a P.O.W., his goal was to escape. And he tried probably seven or eight times and actually was able to get outside of wherever he was. Pulled bars out of cells, tricked people, broke windows, climbed out of bathrooms, did all sorts of things. And he was punished severely every time he did that, but it couldn't deter him. - I was with Bob in 1961 in St. Louis. A fella came up and he says to Bob, "Do you remember Stalag 1, the prison camp?" And Bob says, "I sure remember that place. Were you there?" And this guy said, "Yes." And he said, "I'll never forget the day you threw the bucket of water on the colonel." Six guys, by the way, I guess did get out. But they were captured within a day or two. No one got out to stay out. - I would characterize him as a problem prisoner. You know, he was not the kind of guy the warden liked to have around because he was always up to something. - I was always attempting to escape. Just one time-- 'that's all I lived for. I found there was a major that came in. Had been stationed at Wright Field, and he had just finished flying the Focke-Wulf 190 for ten hours. I made this good friendship with him and I told him that my dying ambition was to escape. There was an airfield nearby where they were operating Focke-Wulf 190s. I said, "Gus, I want to learn everything I can from you about the Focke-Wulf 190. The escape was really nothing. The Germans were deserting. The Russians were coming in from the east and, oh, it was noisy as would be. You got within 50 miles, you could hear those big cannons go off. I headed for the fence with two guys. We got over the fence and went into the woods, which were nearby. - Finally he did escape, and he made it with a couple other people, particularly a friend of his named Jerry Ennis. They met people who were refugees and trying to escape from the Russians at that time, who were now invading Germany. A woman gave them a pistol during that-very important. - We didn't know where we were. We had no maps or charts of any kind. And I said, "Jerry, that looks like an airfield." And I went from one revetment to the next looking for an airplane that looked like it might be flyable. Well, this man walked by in the coveralls and I thought, "Oh, he's a mechanic." And so I said, "Halten!" - And they used their pistol to great effect here because they found one of the crew chiefs, somehow were able to convince him what they wanted to have happen. - The German mechanic helped me start the engine, because I can tell you for sure there's no way I could have done it on my own. But the biggest problem I had was I had no parachute, I needed something to sit me up high enough so I could see out of the airplane. Because without a parachute as a seat cushion I was down like this, looking out like so. I just opened the throttle and went right straight out of that revetment without taxiing anywhere. And once I got airborne, I pulled the gear up and now it started occurring to me "You've got to he the dumbest fighter pilot that ever lived. "Here you are in an enemy airplane, swastikas all over it." - And there are hundreds of Allied fighter pilots roaming this area, hoping to get a shot at somebody. - And so I headed north until I hit the North Sea. And then I went west until I saw windmills. The Dutch people hated the Germans because they'd been occupied by them, and I knew that was friendly territory. So I was searching for windmills. [parade music] ♪♪ First of all, I'd like to share with each of you, I was in a German prison camp. And by any other war, it was a country club. I don't know if you all know Sam Johnson or not, but... - Yes! - Sam Johnson was a great friend of mine. Sam was shot down. I think it was his 25th mission. Really injured pretty seriously, one arm broken in two different locations. But when they got him to Hanoi they took his arms, tied them behind his back and to his feet and then put him on a meat hook and than just beat the living daylights out of him. I even hesitate to even talk about any of my prison experiences when I think about sleeping on concrete for five years, having your feet in stocks-- Isn't he the greatest hero we've ever seen? Let's give him an applause! [applause] - You've got people here that have flown airplanes, and done good over and over again, and they would do anything to come hear Bob Hoover speak. Anything. I I was on the first mission to North Vietnam, and all of us had read about Bob Hoover and his World War ll things. He was the image that you had in the back of your mind about the ability to make decisions and the ability to succeed if it was a demonstration, or warfare, or cross country flight. We was part of the spirit of the fighter pilot the way I think of it. [big band music] - Right after the war, I wanted to go to Wright Field, because that's where all the research flying for the Air Force was taking place. And the first thing I did was go to the Air Force Test Pilot school At that time we were flying 30 or so airplanes in one month's time and a lat of research airplanes that we had not put into production. The average service pilot would never have seen same of these airplanes. They were one or two of a kind. We already knew all of the capabilities of the captured airplanes we flew, but the one that piques most people's interest is the Heinkel 162. That was a jet fighter built by the Germans out of non-strategic materials. So this airplane was bum out of wood. And it was probably one of the most frightening airplanes I've ever flown. There's a condition called an equilibrium-- You pull it up to a certain angle of attack, and it's called a stall, of course, in an airplane... They normally would drop off on one side or the other. Well, this airplane wouldn't drop off. It would fall straight down, just like this. They had put an ejection seat in it because the inlet was right here behind you. They felt the pilot could not get out because he'd get sucked into the engine. I never had to use the seat, hut I thought I was gonna have to. The airplane was coming straight down. Normally you pull the throttle to idle, hoping the nose will drop. It didn't. So I decided I'm going to full power. I had some perceptible change in this attitude, and I thought if I've got the guts to stay in it when I get into the dense air below 5,000 feet, the power will be enough to get the airplane out of this nose-high attitude. I would guess that I got out probably... 500 feet or so above the ground. - If you get down to the basics of real test flying, and that is determining the stability and control and safety of an airplane, test flying is done very much like it was back in the '40s and '50s. And, yes, we use flight test cards and we call them test cards. We number them and we put test maneuvers on them. And we only put the data that the pilot needs to know in order to fly the card properly. And then the engineers of course use that to make sure that the pilot does the maneuvers that they want him to do and to get the data that's needed. - But when you start to develop a brand new style of airplane, we call it the Jet Age, and we're going into the unknown of compressibility and supersonic flight, is something we didn't know anything about. And it wasn't somebody writing miles and miles of Mines of code and all kinds of computer analysis to determine what's gonna happen. They went out and they did it by the seat of their pants. They were really punching into the unknown. - He could tell in his gut and in his hands what the airplane was doing. He could tell very quickly whether you've got a safe airplane or whether you've got an airplane that's gonna have dangerous faults. And a test pilot's-- that feeling, he directs, he communicates that, and he ends up directing the rest of the test program. - Today we get on airliners that have all these aerodynamic features that we take for granted. Each one of those things had to be discovered. And many of those discoveries cost lives. When these test pilots, like Bob Hoover and others, went out and flew an airplane, they did not know what was gonna happen when they tried something. At some point the airplane was gonna reach its limit. And whoever was flying it at that time had better be ready for it. - Wright Field, it was sort of the birthplace of jet flying. They made the first flights at Muroc dry lake bed. It wasn't called Edward's then. It was just a small desert facility, bare bones. But you had 11 miles of dry lake bed, and that was a tremendous security because if you had a malfunction you didn't have to worry about going off the end of the runway. It saved many lives and it sure saved my neck a few times. Very primitive, our jets were. They didn't have good fuel controls. It was a very ticklish thing to start the engine. If you didn't meter the fuel just right by... I call it milking a mouse. You just have to be very gentle and you we just going back and forth, 'cause seen as that temperature starts to go up, it goes up real quick, and you've ruined an engine. We had no pressurization in the cockpit. And when you're above 40,000 feet, many times you're at 50 below zero. And the frost from your breathing coming out of your mask would frost up the who Me canopy and the windshield. Once we bulletproof windshield gets that cold, you can't see out. You'd be flying on instruments, and if you wanted to look out you had to take a glove off and put a thumb up against the side panel, because that's the easiest place 'yen mum get a flew of the human. Before-[clears throat] I was replaced as the project pilot on the X-1, I had been doing compressibility testing. What happens when an airplane gets up to its maximum speed? The airflow breaks down over some of the surfaces on the airplane, and that starts up a big shake in the airplane. The British had lost airplanes flying to go faster than, say, 8/10ths Mach number. And it's catastrophic failure of some surfaces on the airplane, and airplanes disintegrated. They just fall down in powder, as a matter of fact. But I also knew that it would be a great moment in aviation for whoever did it. This airplane was designed like a .30-06 rifle bullet, with very small wings on it, and a tail so you had control of the bullet-shaped vehicle. The Bell pilot who had been on the X-1 program, he wanted $150,000 for that one flight. It came out in the newspapers that he was demanding that much. That's when I was selected to do it for the Air Force on $400 a month pay. Well, one of our newly assigned test pilots, he asked me if I would buzz the Springfield airport. He was trying to get an instructor's rating, and they asked him if he was flying the jets. And so he said, "Oh, yes, I'm involved in them." There weren't very many flying, and there weren't very many of us who were flying them. So he wanted me to buzz the field, and he would take credit for it. On this one day, I had the extra fuel and went across the Springfield airport inverted, came on in, and landed. Months later, the colonel that I reported to called me in and asked if I'd buzzed the field. I told him, "Yes, sir, I had." And he said, "I know two things about you. You're honest because there was only one jet that flew in the whole U.S. that day. The other thing is, I know that you're not accountable. That's when he took me off of the program. It was a bad day for me. [wind howling] And the first time Chuck and I met, I bounced him, and I was flying a P-38. I can't remember what airplane he was flying, but neither one of us could get the advantage on the other. Finally, this voice comes on the radio and says, "Fella, I don't Know who you are, "but I think we better break it off or we're gonna bust our back ends." When I parked he came over and parked his airplane next to mine and that's--that's how Chuck and I met. He was really skilled, I must tell you. And he did a marvelous on that X-1 program. I don't know of anyone who could've done it any better. The big day was when Chuck finally got rid of the myth of a sound barrier. He would be in the dark, up in the bomb bay, and when the airplane was released, he'd come out and here's a bright, sunny day and his eyes would have to adjust. I would be up in the atmosphere where the density of the air was such that you'd leave these vapor trails which we see across the sky and have for all these many years. But he would look for my vapor trail and shoot for that. On this particular day, I knew it was very close to it. I could see him coming up much faster than I'd ever seen it go before. And I was sitting there above 40,000 feet, and when he went by me, I took a photograph, the first one we ever had of an airplane going supersonic, and diamond shockwaves coming out of the rocket motors. On the way down, with Chuck, after his great accomplishment, I came on the microphone and said, "Pard, we'll get a free steak dinner tonight at Poncho's." Poncho's place was a watering hole for all the test pilots. Somebody came over to Poncho's and said, "It's highly classified." And I said, "Well, we've been sitting here in the bar celebrating. It's a little late." We were both testing other types of airplanes while we were on the X-1 program, but it had our priority. When we were back in Dayton, briefing all of the generals on the status of the program, the colonel said something to me, and I had one of my teeth broken off in the front in one of my accidents, and I had a cap over it. And, uh... I was talking away to him, and all of a sudden the tooth went out and hit him right in the chest on his--on his tie. [=chuckles] I reached down and picked it up off the floor. [laughing] And Chuck couldn't contain himself, he started laughing. And that's when I ended up having to bail out and broke both legs, and that was the reason I left that program. I went back to Wright Field. I had been involved in a pretty nasty accident with a P-80. So I went back down from the hospital after I had the exam, and I was just getting ready to take off and the colonel that I reported to, he said, "Bob, what in the world are you doing in that cockpit? You've just had a hell of an experience." I said, "Sir, I've had accidents like that before, "and it just comes with the territory. I'm not hurt." He said, "Young man, it seems to me "that you have had far more troubles "than any of the rest of the test pilots. I'm telling you that I want you to take some time off." And I said, "If you got out of your ivory tower "and flew some of these high-risk flights, then you would understand why I have these problems." Now, if I had been in his shoes, I would've court-martialed a young flight officer, or a lieutenant I guess I was by then. Because that's insubordination any way you look at it. And I look back on it and I think, "Boy, you was an unwise person to say that to your commanding officer." And this is amazing. Here I had insulted him, and actually so much as said "You're a damn coward." And he called me up and he said, "The Allison Division of General Motors "just lost one of their test pilots and they wanted to know who I could recommend." He said, "I told him I had the best test pilot "I had ever seen that I could recommend. "And they're going to be calling you to set up an appointment for you to visit with them." - If he'd have stayed in the Air Force, he-- undoubtedly he'd have made a general officer. But how many people would he have touched? Okay, quite a few. But he's touched millions of more by getting out and being able to talk to people, demonstrate airplanes that the Air Force was flying at the time. He's provided a service to military aviation, particularly fighter aviation, that couldn't have been done had he stayed in that service. But that's just my personal viewpoint. - One company, and that was North American Aviation, had built the best airplanes I had ever flown. And when they called me, I decided I would learn every facet of that company. I could see down stream, What if I couldn't fly'? I better be prepared to do something else. So when they hired me-- And I went in to meet the president of the company and one of the founders-- He said, "What are your ambitions?" I said, "Eventually, I want to be sitting in your chair." In our little cadre there were six of us in experimental, and as we would lose a pilot, well, they'd just--they'd hire somebody else to come in and fill those shoes. The losses were, uh... pretty high. Not--not as bad as combat, but, uh, you know... you-you stick your hand in a fire often enough, you could get it burned. The first years involved flying the F-86. Every change that's made, you have to go test it all over again. And then the F-100. And then the OV-10. The FJ-2, I made the first flight on it. And also the Navy version of the T-28. And the Sabreliner, one of the first of the smaller business jets. With each promotion, Dutch assured me that as long as he was running the company that I could stay in the cockpit and handle dual responsibilities. And he kept throwing them at me, and I managed to luck out and surround myself with the right people and... all of my dreams came true. I learned an immense amount of things that I had not known before. I sat in on all the top meetings having to do with confidential designs. It was an opportunity to really learn a lot more than I'd ever learned before. Our company designed the rocket motors that powered us to space, to the moon. The space division had the opportunity of building the Apollo 13, all of the Apollos that went to the moon. So we had the power plants and we had the vehicle that went to the moon. - Well, Bob was at North American for a long time and, uh, the history of North American's airplanes was they built this P-51 fighter which was essentially the best fighter of the war. They built the F-86, which was the best fighter of that Korean vintage time. And then they built this F-100 which was to be the follow on F-86 to the F-86. So his contributions to that were really material and, um, you know, the fact that the ejection seat worked is demonstrated by me sitting in this chair talking to you. So, we've made a lot of great progress and Bob's always been on the leading edge of that stuff. - Neat thing about a test pilot is he has a very unique responsibility because what he does And how he develops and tests the airplane, knowing in the back of your mind that that airplane is going to be operated with people that are not as experienced. It's going into the normal world, the normal squadrons. And when that airplane goes into combat, is there a flaw? - Well, the purpose is to make sure that it's safe for the average aviator. You know, the young navy guy that just got his wings. So, you push limits out there that are-- They do the same with civilian airplanes. My Bonanza, it's a 4G airplane. Well, when it was tested, they tested it not to 6. So the envelope is bigger than where we fly it. - Although there may be people that say, well, it's not really that bad and we need to write it off and we need to get it operational, but the responsibility of a test pilot, ethically, to aviation and his fellow aviators is to make sure that airplanes with very dangerous capabilities never end up in an operational squadron. - Bob Hoover had done the testing on the majority of the F-100s. Actually, from the A model through the F model - Working on this flight manual for the 100, we spent a lot of times together, lunches, and little talks about how should we be writing this so the people aren't going to get confused, one thing or another. He always had a very common sense ability to put some good solutions into words that you were kind of wrestling with, you know? So, he was a very learned guy. There probably isn't anybody out there who knows more about fighter airplanes than Bob Hoover. - One time when Bob took off in his F-86, when the stick froze. Now, here you have a frozen stick and the airplane is not controllable. Well, then what is your only option? If you can't steer the car... [chuckles] You'd better stop or you're going to hit something. And the same thing in an airplane, only much worse. - And they told him, "Bail out, bail out, bail out." And he says, "No, I think I can save it anyway with the trim flab and the throttle control." He get it to Edwards, I believe, and landed, I think he told me, at 240 knots. - And that was an incredible feat. And in flight test development you want to bring back the airplane if you can so they can fix it, and not only that, find out What's wrong and fix it. And Bob was able to do that. - That sounds like an impossible situation for anybody to ever accomplish, But Bob Hoover did it. And that's the reason Bob Hoover is recognized as probably the-- One of the greatest pilots and not to me, the greatest... probably the greatest pilot that ever lived. - Working for North American, I started demonstrating their airplanes, worldwide. During the Korean conflict, when I arrived at this one base, I heard this one lieutenant say to another, "What does that old guy know about flying?" - He was going around in the Air Force, in those days, to my knowledge, selling North American which is-- that was his job. But, uh, he could show how you could do things with it safely. And that was his whole pitch. "Don't you go out and try "this yourself, but I'm just going to show you the limits the airplane will go to." - Bob would go around to air guards and to active duty Air Force bases and put on a demonstration just to show the average pilot how docile the F-86 was. He would usually walk up to the maintenance officer and say, 'What's the biggest dog you have here?" And every squadron had an airplane they thought was a dog that--you know-- it didn't fly well. Well, if Bob had the opportunity he would take the worst airplane they had to further enhance his demonstration in the minds of the pilots. - He walked along the fleet that we had there, that we were flying day to day, and just said, "I'll take this one." And he always came in a good looking business suit. This was just for military people, so we could follow him around and watch everything he did. I mean, he-everything he did was what we tried to emulate after that. - I'll never forget, he said, "Nellie Tower." He said, "Am I clear for a roll on takeoff?" And the tower said, "You're clear to roll." He said, "No, am I clear to roll on takeoff?" They said, "You are clear to roll." He lit the afterburn, leaped up and did a roll, and the guy in the tower said, "Like I said, you are clear to roll," and he just kept on going. - Then he started to amaze us with hard... slow... and dramatic maneuvers. - Rolling the airplane down the runway on one wheel, and then he'd flip it over on the other wheel, and then he'd zoom up and he'd roll and, uh-- We were all young lieutenants at the time and just absolutely-ah! You know? - Took off and did things that we didn't even think the airplane would do. - We watched him go to the extremes in such beauty that, uh, it stays with you. - He provided a pilot with confidence that they were smart enough, maybe not to try what he did with it, but they knew that if they had to they could probably live through it. - I remembered what the instructions were from Mr. Hoover. I lit the afterburn and Joe said, "What the--" And, uh--because we were going straight down to the desert. - And I was one maneuver away from out of control, and that maneuver was something that Bob Hoover had told Ralph Brooks and I about over a beer at the Reno air races two weeks previous. I had never practiced it-- that isn't a maneuver you would practice, it's-- It'd be like practicing Russian Roulette or something. - What I'd heard in that theater Four years age, or five years ago, whatever it was, was what gut me nut of that spin. - And, uh, that he had told us about at Reno was what saved my life. - That's kind of scary to me. And I'm fearless. - Demonstrating an airplane in Germany, this one gentleman came up and he had on a felt hat and his suit looked like something from the '30s. He said, "I'd like to talk to you privately." Well, I didn't Know who he was, and I said, "Sir, I would very much like to talk with you. "However, it would be embarrassing for me "to neglect all of these people for a single individual. Would you mind until an opportunity presents itself?" And so he walked over and stood in the shadows there, if you will, and the crowd finally thinned clown and I walked over and apologized to him for keeping him waiting and he said, "I understand. "I want to talk to you about what's going on "in aviation and what's taking place these days. My name is Charles Lindbergh." And I looked at him with great awe. I can't believe I'm meeting the man that inspired me. He said, "My name is Schwartz now. "No one knows me, and I don't wish to be recognized or have my name ever in the publicity again." He had a tap secret clearance. When I returned to Los Angeles, they said, "You make sure that top secret clearance "is still in effect, and go right ahead and setup appointments for him." And I've often looked back on it and thought, how many engineers and wonderful scientific people that I had brief him, never knowing that it was Charles Lindbergh that they were briefing. Finally one day I said, "It's a shame that other people don't get to know you." He really wanted to be obscure, and I was the president of The Society of Experimental Test Pilots in '69, and I talked to him about the organization. I said, "Look, now that I have announced that the Apollo 11 crew are going to be here, there're going to be a thousand people out that door Looking for the Apollo 11 crew. Why don't you let me sneak you in? You could walk in there and nobody will ever recognize you." Nobody recognized him. And he was sitting there and they came up and all wanted Neil's signature and picture taken, and Lindbergh leaned across Colleen and said, "Neii, you're going to regret signing these autographs." And Neil just turned to him and politely said, "Sir, every pilot in this room has accepted the risk "that I have taken. "If they want my autograph or my picture, that is the very least I can do." And when I brought Lindbergh on stage, I have never seen such pandemonium in my life. The applause was a standing ovation that my gavel wouldn't get them to stop. They just kept screaming and yelling and... it was the biggest night of his life. And he told me that later. That photograph hit the front page of every paper in the world, I think. And the whole world had a chance to see him, after all these many years. It was a great evening. - [Announcer] "It's exciting. It's nostalgic. "It's educational. "Zooming, rolling, and looping your way soon will be Bob Hoover and his F-51 Mustang aerial demonstration! "One of the greatest precision pilots in history, Hoover presents an aerial demonstration that defies description. "Hoover even makes the Mustang do the Tennessee Waltz before landing on one wheel." - I have been so lucky on some of my emergencies. For instance, having a seatbelt break on you. Who in the world would ever worry about a seatbelt not functioning right? It was in the Mustang. The airplane was 40 years old when I bought it. I never bothered changing the seatbelt. It looked great to me. While I was at Reno and I was doing this knife edge roll, that means you're flying on the fuselage and your wings are up and down, so you get no lift out of that. So you have to have enough speed for the lift to come off the side of the airplane plus the propeller holding the nose up. I was doing the knife edge, and I went underneath and as soon as I got underneath, the seatbelt let go and I went right into the canopy. And I was-- My buttocks was up in the canopy. And I had my hand on the throttle and this one on the stick. But, my head and neck, I'm upside down like this. And if I take the power off, I'm going to go into the ground. If I add power, it's going to torque. I--you think for a few seconds, "This is it. There's no way out." Well, I thought, I've gotten seconds before that engine quits. And I've got to keep that stick right where I've got it and I can't touch the throttle because that will throw me into a roll and I'll go right into the ground. And so I kept on to it, thought "don't quit now" on that engine. "Don't quit! See, I didn't have my feet on the rudders. I'm up in the canopy! And so, when I whomped the stick, it went around, and I went right back in there and I caught the rudders just like this in time. And I came on the radio with calm voice and this is the funny thing about exciting times in an airplane. I called my crew chief and I said, "Uh, see if you can okay another safety belt for me." I said, "I've lost my safety belt and I'll need that before the next flight." - There are many people that probably owe their lives to Bob. When I really got to know Bob well, it was at the first Reno race in 1964. - Flying his P-51, Ole Yeller he would depart first and then one by one the racers from flue unlimited class would take off, they'd join up on Bob's right wing. And then, as they were diving in, if all looked good, we would hear, from his cockpit radio, over the P.A. system, "Gentlemen! You have a race!" - [P.A. system] Gentlemen! You have a race! - Bob Hoover would then pull up, high above the racers, over the race course, roll his aircraft upside down-- He would then transition from the pace plane pilot to be the guardian angel. I I've seen him giving instructions to four different pilots at Reno one time, when four people had an emergency. And Bob would go down by one and look at it and see how high he was whenever they say, uh, "You're looking pretty good but maybe just a little high." And then when that guy was a little squared away, he'd run back up to the other one and say, "Now you might-I might suggest you do this and that." Anyway, he was just fabulous. - I witnessed one of the most exquisite pieces of direction I have ever witnessed in my life. One of the unlimited racers in his P-51 had an extreme Mayday. We could see there was a lot of relative speed on the part of the stricken airplane. - "Race 49, when I say three, you're going to ground loop it." - "Hit rudder now!" I And I knew his voice, of course, and trusted him. What he was asking me to do was something we were taught never to do. It's a mistake to do a ground loop. - The airplane, which was on its main gear, with the tail flying, then did a hard right turn. The nose and the spinner and the prop went into the ground, the torque turned it around, there was dust everywhere. As it finally settled, the tail came back down. The pilot was safe. He lived. The airplane was repaired. And the two of them had lived to fly again. Lloyd's of London, the insurance company, had given Bob an award for being the most insurable pilot in the world. Skip Holm, the great test pilot and air race pilot, stood up and he said, "If I ever get in trouble around this pylon course, I want it to be Bob Hoover who is my guardian angel" And with that, all of the unlimited racers and all of the racers in this giant hangar stood up and gave Bob a standing ovation. - And his North American Mustang, the greatest fighter plane of World War ll, will bring back memories to any aviation fan, young or old. - Bob, one evening, flew everybody else's airplane there, about five different airplanes. And he got in them and did his show that he was doing in his P-51 in their airplane. And several of the planes he had never flown before, you know. And he went right into the aerobatics, you know, didn't fly it for five minutes to see-get the feel of it. He had the feel. -And then, I mean, half an hour to an hour later, the same routine. He didn't shut the motors off. Somebody from Canada loaned him an F-86. Loaned him the airplane! Not one that he flew every day. So four different acts, air show acts, in four different North American airplanes. Unbelievable. Then I knew, I'm watching the pilot of all time. - His trademark was suit and tie. At the first Reno races and things, he was still doing that. I mean-other people had flying suits, and when we started getting Nomex fire protection suits and he didn't need to protect himself. He did have a fire file in his P-51. He said he had a little fire. And when I saw the picture, he had a little fire--he had fire coming out of one wing, going back, 100 feet behind the airplane. He thought something might blow up, and he shut it off while it was still rolling. He got out of the cockpit and jumped off the wing. About that time, Bob decided a Nomex flying suit wasn't a bad idea. - When I first saw Bob Hoover perform, I didn't know anything about his military background or his test flight background. I only knew him as an air show performer. That performance, and all the many, many performances he gave, all over the world, literally touched millions and millions of people. And many of those people now are in aviation, and I've been around Bob when people come up to him and say the same story that I'm relating. That, you know--"Your air show, or seeing you perform, is what inspired me to get into aviation." - Touching down ever so lightly in the Shrike Commander, there's the puff of smoke indicating that he has touched down. Now cleaning the aircraft up, Bob will go set for his famed energy management series. - All the times that R.A. "Bob" Hoover would be taxiing back, and the incredible joy on the people's faces of how many millions of millions of people you touched just by doing your job... I mean, millions, hundreds and hundreds of millions of people. I mean, you were the greatest of all time. The greatest of all time. I mean, you knew how to move an audience. - I think you've outdone me my good friend-- - I--I don't think so. I--I just don't think-- Uh, I've learned from you, but you flew--you fly an airplane "finessefully." - Yeah, it's the grace. - It is the grace. - It's the grace that he has as a pilot. That same grace is part of his everyday life also. I met Bob through Sean Tucker a number of years ago, and I have admired him as a pilot, as a human being. I have enormous respect for his contributions to aviation and his interest in furthering the issues of aviation, preserving the opportunities of aviation, and keeping young people involved and interested in aviation and aviation careers, both for themselves and for the benefits it brings to our society at large. - I just wish Bob was still performing today, because he can't do it forever but, you know, he did so much for so long and touched so many lives, it's really an amazing feat. - Where the air flow breaks down on parts of the aircraft... I enjoyed every minute of my flying days, but I had adjusted my thinking that one day, no one would be able to tell me when I should quit flying. I will be able to tell myself. The airplane dug in this way... And it started with my knee problems with the Mustang after being grounded three years. And, uh-the last show that I participated in was at Luke Air Force Base over near Phoenix, Arizona. My dear friend, Sean Tucker, was there... and, uh... I made my decision that day. I didn't like what I had done. Nobody on the ground knew it, but I knew that I very nearly lost the airplane. And I had never been close to that feathered edge as I was that day. And I was able to hold it, but, boy, it was a rude awakening because I thought, 'You've been telling yourself all these years you will know when to quit." And I thought I was going to do that maneuver just as perfectly as I'd done it a thousand times and I had done it a thousand times. But it only takes one slip and it's all over. And I just decided, that's it. Because I never wanted anybody to think that I got killed in an airplane at the controls. I wanted to bow out gracefully, do my flying as I wanted to but not before the public, and I continued doing that till I was 85. - To say if another Bob Hoover will come along, I don't think so. Because it's all different now. There's so many more regulations, let's say, and things that most pilots aren't taking the freedom they have. They come up in a book of regulations that they don't know or are not really aware that the plane will still fly if they go off the beaten path. And Bob was always off the beaten path. - Most of his peers are now-- You know, they're written in history books, but most of them are gone. And, uh, you knew, when the time comes and we're all going to go, as my granddaughter says, "Up there someday, POPPY," uh...he will be somewhat of the last of his breed. But he will have left his mark in history, he will have left a challenge for those who follow in his footsteps. And he will be part of the legacy of the Wright brothers that will, I behave, continue on forever. - Now we're looking at things like antigravity, nanotechnology, and the things that, uh, with my limited education I don't understand but I would say that, uh, we're just moving in to the most interesting part of probably aviation that, uh, that we've lived through. Although it's been very exciting for the last hundred years, the next 25 years are going to be a very exciting time for aviation. - Breakthroughs are out there. Lots of them are out there. We don't know what they are because they are breakthroughs. They probably don't even seem sensible now. Usually, before a breakthrough is recognized as being a breakthrough it's considered nonsense. So someone has to have confidence in nonsense if he's going to be in a position to do a breakthrough. [triumphant music] ♪♪ - Bob took a basic business aircraft and flew it to the performance edges. Now, doing that with a stock business aircraft is different because they're just regular engines that have not been improved for aerobatics. Bob's plane is configured in a feathered condition. If you're flying along and you have an engine problem, you want to feather the props so that they're not creating a drag on the airplane. And then you can maneuver the aircraft much more easily to get it down in an emergency situation. What we wanted to do was show it in that famous configuration of his when he does the last turn, the 180 degree turn to final, he lands on one wheel, brings the aircraft up, lands on another wheel, and then still rolls the plane to air show center at-- with no engines and with the props feathered. And that's the configuration we wanted to show, that people come away with saying, "That's how I see the airplane when he finishes his routine." - Dreams came true here in America. We have more freedoms to fly than anywhere else in the world. We just got to figure out a way, how to get it to that next generation. - Well, the benefits, you know, that have accrued to this country from aviation from-- From wartime and peacetime, are just not well understood anymore. Military aviation, civil aviation, commercial guys, the little private pilots-- If we don't all work together, we're going to lose it. - Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, there's a camaraderie, Harrison, among aviators all over the world. That's what all of us, as aviators, have enjoyed so much. It's part of our good life, and it is a good life because I've not met very many people who were flying that I didn't immediately like.
