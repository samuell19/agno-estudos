Why have we been listening to the same song every time? You can change it if you don't like it. Your hair is so long. It has been a while... Mum, watch the road. We'll make a fire when we'll get there. Mum, what are doing? Stop! Stop! I killed someone... "Cracks" Silence please, I'll record the sound of the ground. "Earth bubbling", take one... Rolling! It's for you. Hello? When? It was very beautiful. A lot of people were there. I have written everything there. You'll also find her locket. It's has been a while since we've been like that. I know. She should never have moved there. When were you there for the last time? It was four years ago, I think. Are you sure you want to go there alone? Why did they do that to her? The police doesn't know yet. You should call the police officer who is in charge. Did she suffer? Mrs. Blanc? Hello... I would like to talk to you. I have nothing to tell you. Come. Come. I wasn't coming very often since she was here. I live in Paris. The local trail seems to be the most probable. We went through the house. Nothing has been stolen, but we can't find no agenda or address book. So, it means for us that the killer knew her. Maybe one of her costumers. Do you know some of them? We were never talking about that. Who was she frequenting in the village? I don't know. Did she have an affair? I don't think so. Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Viel? No. This couple found the body. They had an appointment that day. You were here few days before she died. Have you noticed something unusual? I don't know. The car crash with the stag really devasted her. When can I get it? In a week. I thought this file was over. It's not your lucky day! Stop it! Now play! Hello, I am Mrs. Bourmel, as the mayor. Nice to meet you, I'm Charlotte Mérisse. I heard you were here. I wanted to see you to offer my condolences to you. - Did you know my mother? but what happened really shocked me. Are you moving here? Come to our place tonight. You need to meet people. Are you free? 1,98. It's 100 % organic. You will taste the difference. Here. Thank you. Why did you invite her? I make 300 000 tonnes of fertiliser a year. with this. She likes organic food. I'm scared of the witch... What are you doing here? Aren't you sleeping? Every time, it's the same story! Every time! Let us eat in peace! I am in favour of the choice for the customer. Organic, not organic... It's good to have the choice. What's wrong is all these young people who sell that and leave the others powerless. Organic growing here is a sect. It starts with tomatoes and ends with black masses... Charlotte, you don't drink? Look at these tomatoes. They were treated with my husband's fertiliser. Let's talk about you. You work in the film industry? In wildlife documentaries. I'm a sound recorder. You'll be able to record chicken cries, we have plenty of them here... Hello, Jérôme. You mother is not here? She's doing the cleaning at the church... ...every day from 4:30 to 7:00. You have kept it? Hello? Hello, the pencil factory? Is anybody here? Why did you let her come in? She' going to jinx us. Stop it, mum. I'm not a child anymore. Now that we got rid of the mother, let's not encourage the daughter to move here. "House cracks, first time". Charlotte! Please, turn it down, I've got a headache. Charlotte! Please, turn it down, I've got a headache. Charlotte! Please, turn it down... Charlotte! One, two. One, two... Hello? Charlotte... Oh... I'm so disappointed. I had everything prepared. South America? For how long? Call me when you get back. Big kisses. Charlotte, go outside for some fresh air. What about your friends here? - And Jérôme? - You don't see him anymore? No, his mother doesn't like that. You should go read in the garden. You never go out since we're here. It's sad to come here for summer and not enjoy the sun. You look pale. Have you seen your face? Don't give me advices. We decided to go to England for holydays. We took the bus with a bunch of people to take the ferry. And the more we were getting closer to the see, the more she was getting worried and having dizzy spells. So we were stopping and going. It was like she wanted us to loose time. And because of her, we missed the boat. And the boat sank... - I don't believe in that. I can't bring nobody to the house with her. She's going to become a witch... Mummy? Mummy? Mum! Mum... Charlotte... Charlotte! What did you do to her? Can you help me? Can you do something for me? Help me. I don't know what to do. I've lost nine beasts in one month. I have one picture but I will bring you more. Mrs. Mérisse? She doesn't even hide it anymore. She does it with men... who could be my sons. Why didn't you tell me you knew her? It's not legal. You mother helped me a lot... on a personal level. I also went through a painful grieving process. At first, I came for something different. One year ago, a child went missing in the half of the day. He was going to his violin lesson. No sign... No evidence... He was Mr. and Mrs. Viel's son. I hope he is not cold. Your mother told us he was dead... ...buried. And that the tragedy will come from that place. You never talk about your daughter. Tell me more about her, I don't even know her name. How is she? Ten years ago, she knew what she wanted to be. I know where that comes from... Oh no... No, I wasn't like her. It took me a long time to be what I wanted to be. It took me years to take responsibility for it. Do you see her regularly? She's withdrawing into herself. I think she never forgave me certain things. ...If you do it like that, it makes a bunch... Wait a second. Wait! Wait. You came here to see the organic growing? You came here, so I'll show you around it. Are you passing through the area? My name is Charlotte Mérisse. Julien. I've heard what happened. I'm sorry. Your mother was a good person. Do you believe in all those things? In clairvoyance? Here, taste this. Zero treatment. You don't even need to wash it before you eat it. Can we use the "tu" form? She told me for you guys. I thought she wanted to keep it secret. You should have called me for the wood. I can cut it. You already have a lot to do. You rather should find a hobby that is not work. I'd like to do something here... for you. Myself, I'd like you to do something for you. To open yourself to the others. To meet somebody. No, Jérôme... I will confide in you openly. I might be wrong. These buggers want me to close the factory. Don't exaggerate. You made promises to them. The "organic fertlisers", you remember? A commission from the ministry is coming. How do I know you didn't denounce me? You are the only one who knows for my stock, except the seller. Why do you ask me that? It's over now. I will explain to you later. I know you wrote everything down. I need these dates. On August 21th 1988. It was 2:30 when we arrived to the hospital. What about the enquiry? Anything new? Now they know that a man did it. They do DNA tests on everybody. Jérôme? Jérôme? I know you were seeing my mother. Wait! I just need to know when you saw her. I just need the dates. I want to know when you saw her for the last time. When? I know things... like my mother. What do you know? Me too, I'd like to know who did that. I can't allow this in my town. Help me then. Honestly, young lady, if I had the solution, I would give it to you but I don't. Have you considered my offer? - I'm not selling the house. It won't stand for a long time. And for this kind of houses, there is no insurance. Why do you want it then? Because your land is full of holes and I could use it to do something useful and good for the town. The first time, she didn't want to receive me. Maybe because your husband saw her before you? Jean-Pierre? No, he doesn't believe in that. The second time... she was the one who wanted to see me. And that is where she told me we should be careful with the water. It happened three days before the murder. We can't be sure to the minute. Mummy? I want to move here. And what are you going to be? "The village witch"? Mummy... What about Charlotte? She will go away even further from you. She will understand me one day. I'm sure of that. I'd like to do something here... for you. You're so beautiful... You're the only person who knows for my stock. Are you worried? What's wrong? Everything's fine. You are not relaxed. I can feel it. Is it because of your pills? You don't show your feelings. It's hard to work you out. I'm just starting to work myself out. The recipe you give at the market is yours? I'll put that together in a cookbook one day. After dinner, I'll tell you if I'll buy it or not. I heard your mother was sick. That's why I came back here. You are lucky. I mean, it's good you guys can have time together. I fell like I missed something. You never asked me where I was when it happened. I'm sorry. Three thousand... seven hundred... forty-two... steps from my house... to here... You're the only one thing from her I'm left with. I want you to leave. The results of the DNA tests show that he was supposedly on the scene on that day. He agreed to talk, but only to you. I know it's not easy. Think about it before you do it. I was there at 4:15 pm. How can you be so specific? I came right after my mum left for the church. I knocked on the door but she didn't answer. I came in. Carry on. There were items on the ground. Newspapers cut up... A broken glass. I called her. She was lying on the ground, next to the table. I thought she needed help, that she passed out. The scissors were... ...next to her. She was injured. She wasn't breathing anymore. I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her. Miss! I have got to show you something. He would never have hurt that woman. What if it was a man? You would have left an injured person? Yes. I only thought about myself. It's a sign... I've always known it. Is it happening again? Mum, you promised, you remember? What you are saying doesn't make sense. I can't help it. I see big problems coming from the water. The water? Why are you telling me that? You can't tell me that. He is buried. I know something is going to happen because of that place. It's my mother... What was she doing? A simple glass of water killed her. You really need to keep on looking for him. You have to dig all around. What to do you mean? I know you will find something. I can't see you tonight, my daughter is coming. It's a sign... Mum, you promised, you remember? Mrs. Mérisse? Sorry, I can't receive you now. Come back tonight, at six. You are not going to worry because of a stag? I know something is going to happen to me. I fell like I've always lived with a dead stag. I am scared. You were here on February 19th, the day she died. She called me at five in the morning. She was totally terrified. She was scared. I didn't want to sadden you. I know your reaction regarding her visions. I need to know when you arrived and when you left. Charlotte? What is that noise? Tell me the hour! One, two, three, four, five six, seven... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... nine, ten, eleven, twelve... I wanted to tell you for a long time. You have to tell them what happened. I can't. You have to. They won't be ok as long as you keep it secret. What do you think? That I'm not suffering? You think I forgot, like that? You won't be better just with the pills. I'll come with you. We are going to go together. You'll tell everything. You ran away, that's all. It was an accident. What are you doing? Think about his parents. And my mother. Did you think about her? Who is going to take care of her? Stop it with your mother. A child died because of you. You need help. Yes, I am sure. My mother had drunk water. I loved her, you know? She was... Shut up!
