Woman on phone: Please stay with me, Mrs. Carter. Help is on the way. Talk to me, Mrs. Carter. [ knocking on door ] [ knocks ] Woman: HEY, TAYLOR, SORRY TO INTERRUPT. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? 1-8-7 ON THE HILL. AW, JEEZ. WHY ME? PHIFER ASKED FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY. I THOUGHT YOUR BROTHER WAS COMING OVER. NO, HE CANCELLED. WHO WAS IT? THE MAYOR'S COUSIN. - LUKE CARTER? - YEAH. THE MAYOR, IS SHE THERE? NOT YET. PHIFER THOUGHT SHE SHOULDN'T SEE HER COUSIN THAT WAY. WHAT WAY? LET'S JUST SAY HE... LOST HIS BRAINS. WE'LL NEED A LOT OF THEM. WHO DISCOVERED HIM? WIFE. KNOW HER? ANGELA CARTER. OF COURSE YOU DO. THE RICO INVESTIGATION. Taylor: OUR FAIR CITY. YEAH, THE GARBAGE STRIKE'S GOT EVERYONE ON EDGE. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF HERE. [ police sirens blaring ] SO, MR. LEWIS, ARE YOU BACK ON MURDERS OR IS THIS STILL PART OF YOUR RICO INVESTIGATION? - NO COMMENT, JOHNSON. - ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT CARTER'S DEATH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH "RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS"? HOW DID YOU GET HERE SO SOON? I GUESS LEECHES HAVE A NOSE FOR BLOOD. DON'T HOLD OUT ON ME. YOU KNOW WHAT KAREN GENARO WOULD SAY. IS IT BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE? IS IT BECAUSE HE'S THE MAYOR'S COUSIN? Johnson: ONE COMMENT, PLEASE! COME ON, LEWIS! MISSY, LEWIS. THIS IS A TRICKY ONE. POLITICALLY SENSITIVE. NOT TO BE EXPEDITIOUSLY ASSIMILATED. I GOT TO CONVENE A SECTIONAL IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS THE PRELIMINARIES ARE IN. YOU BE THERE. PHIFER? ENLIGHTEN ME. WHY AM I HERE? BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO. AND YOU KNEW LUKE CARTER. THAT WAS A RICO INDICTMENT. I THOUGHT WE AGREED I WAS OFF COP CASES. GIVE IT TO MISSY, OKAY? NO OFFENSE, MISSY, I NEED PRESENCE ON THE SCENE, SOMEBODY WITH A PUBLIC PROFILE. NOW, YOU SURE HAVE SCREWED UP IN THE PAST. WE KNOW IT, THE PRESS KNOWS IT AND THE PUBLIC KNOWS IT. IF YOU DO THIS RIGHT, YOU CLEAN THIS UP, YOU GET A CHANCE AT SOME PROFESSIONAL REDEMPTION, I GET A CHANCE AT SOME PUBLICITY. IT'S A WIN-WIN SITUATION. JUST GO TO WORK. TRY AND LOOK OFFICIOUS. Phifer to press: GENTLEMEN, I CAN GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES-- - HEY, EARL! - HI. SO, HOW WAS THE YACHTING THIS SUMMER? GREAT, I GOT SOME REALLY GOOD WIND. YOU GUYS REALLY SHOULD HAVE COME OUT. WHO'S THE HEAD CLOWN ON THIS? I AM. TALK ABOUT OFFICIOUS. WHAT'CHA GOT, DE LUCA? BALLISTICS SAID A GUNSHOT TO THE HEAD. REALLY? LOOKS LIKE A HEART ATTACK TO ME. WEAPON? PROBABLY IN THE BAY BY NOW. FANCY SURVEILLANCE. De Luca: LATEST TECHNOLOGY. FOUR OF THEM, FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOM. VIDEOTAPE? ALSO AWOL. WHOEVER DID IT KNEW THE RECORDER WAS IN THE CELLAR. HE WENT THAT WAY. GOES TO A PED TUNNEL UNDER OCEAN AVENUE. WE FOUND FOOTPRINTS. CLASSIC MOB HIT IF YOU ASK ME. WHO'S ASKING? YEAH, WELL-- TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE. CITY TRASH CONTRACT BID. IT WAS STUFFED IN HIS POCKET. NOW, TELL ME THAT AIN'T MOB RELATED. HMM. THE WIFE? [ yawns ] IN THE DEN. SHE'S GONZO, POOR THING. YOU'RE ALL HEART, DE LUCA, JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME. HEY, IT AIN'T PERSONAL. I MEAN, LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. IT WAS MY JOB TO INVESTIGATE THE SNAFU IN THE GENARO CASE AND-- AND SELL MY FILE TO THAT REPORTER? I NEVER DID THAT. AW, SHUT UP. JUST SHOW ME TO HER. MRS. CARTER? MY NAME IS TAYLOR LEWIS, I'M THE DEPUTY STATE ATTORNEY. YOU'RE NOT UNDER ARREST, BUT WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN FOR QUESTIONING. MAY BE A GOOD TIME TO GET A LAWYER. I'M INNOCENT. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. DO YOU BELIEVE ME? I CAN'T COMMENT. YOU'RE GONNA TWIST IT AROUND, AREN'T YOU? MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S ME. GUILTY OR INNOCENT, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. DOES IT? EXCUSE ME. HE'S REALLY GOOD AT THIS STUFF. YOU'RE A JERK, CARMINE. YOU OKAY? FINE, THANKS. I'M FINE. REALLY. I WAS JUST WORRIED. I THOUGHT AFTER A YEAR MAYBE YOU WERE SHAKING IT. LOOK, I'M SORRY I CANCELLED OUR DATE. SO, ARE THERE ANY OTHER SUSPECTS? I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS ONE YET! ACCORDING TO PHIFER. OH, GREAT! HERE WE GO AGAIN. DON'T LET WHAT SHE SAID THROW YOU! THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN GENARO! HOW SO? DIDN'T WE ASSUME SHE WAS GUILTY ALSO? THAT'S WHAT WE DO. IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. YOU DIDN'T KILL HER. OH-- THERE'S A BRIEFING BEFORE DE LUCA WARMS HER OVER AT 10:00. Phifer: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET STARTED. OKAY... LUKE CARTER. SON OF ARMENIAN IMMIGRANTS, BORN IN CHICAGO, 1944. FIRST ARREST AGE 14. TRIED AS AN ADULT FOR MURDER. BEAT THE RAP. MOVED TO MIAMI IN '84 TO START A BEACH HOT DOG CART FRANCHISE. IS THAT THE ONE WITH THE BABES IN THE BIKINI FLOSS? YEAH. SOLD THE BUSINESS FIVE YEARS LATER FOR UPWARD OF FIVE MILLION BUCKS. THAT'S A LOT OF HOT DOGS. AND BUNS. YEAH, BABY. [ laughs ] AFTER THAT, CAME TO BALTIMORE AND INVESTED IN A GARBAGE COMPANY WITH HIS PARTNER, MOE "THE MONGOOSE" FRITKIN. "MONGOOSE." I LOVE THESE MOB MONIKERS. WE'RE LOOKING INTO HIM AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT THOUGH HIS ALIBI SEEMS SOLID. I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE WIFE. YES. ANGELA MAY CARTER, 35. BORN HERE IN BALTIMORE. FATHER, LOU, A WELDER. MOTHER, MIA, HOUSEWIFE. HAS A DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY. MARRIED ONCE BEFORE TO ROY FRANKMAN, RESTAURATEUR, "THE ENCLAVE." HUH, I REMEMBER IT. GOOD FOOD. DIED ON A FISHING TRIP NEAR HOPE ISLAND. FELL OVERBOARD AT NIGHT, DEAD DRUNK. - SHE WAS ON THE BOAT. - REALLY? BUT SO WERE FIVE OTHERS. RULED AN ACCIDENT. ANY INSURANCE? A MILLION DOLLAR POLICY. BUT THE IRS TOOK IT ALL FOR BACK TAXES. SHE FILED BANKRUPTCY. ANYWAY, SHE MET CARTER A YEAR LATER AND THEY GOT MARRIED AFTER A MONTH. WHAT'S THE ESTATE WORTH? SIX MILLION, I GUESS. HOUSE ON THE HILL, CONDO IN PALM BEACH, CABIN IN TAHOE. OWNED A MOTORCYCLE DEALERSHIP ON THE WEST SIDE. VEHICLES-- A LAMBORGHINI, A MERCEDES, A COUPLE OF BIKES. - HE LIKED HIS TOYS. - SURE DID. COLLECTED SHOTGUNS, TOO. THE FINANCIALS INCLUDE MINOR STOCKS IN MUTUAL FUNDS, LOW YIELD BONDS, NO RETIREMENT PLAN AND... NO LIFE INSURANCE. THAT HURTS. WHAT ELSE? WE FOUND FOOTPRINTS IN THE UNDERPASS-- BEHIND THE YARD. NOT A SHOE IN THE HOUSE MATCHES. FORENSICS? BALLISTIC ANALYSIS POINTS TO A SHOTGUN LOADED WITH SUB-OUGHT SHELLS. HE WAS SHOT IN THE FACE, AT EXTREMELY CLOSE RANGE. EXECUTION STYLE. THEN SHE SHOULD HAVE HAD SOME BLOOD ON HER. YEAH, EXCEPT THAT SHE JUMPED IN THE WATER AND PULLED HIM OUT. WHAT ABOUT THE N.A.A? TO SEE IF SHE DISCHARGED A WEAPON? NEGATIVE FIND. AGAIN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN WIPED BY THE WATER, BUT... CHECK THIS OUT. TRACE METAL TESTS, NOT EASILY WIPED AWAY. IT CAN STICK WITH YOU AT LEAST A WEEK. THE BLUE LIGHT SHOWS TRACES ON HER HANDS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPOSITION OF A SHOTGUN. BINGO. ANYTHING ON THE ALIBI? CATHERINE BICKS-AHMED, 33. BORN IN TAMPA. SHE'S MARRIED TO SHEIK MAFIR AHMED. SHE'S A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER. SUSPECT SAYS SHE WAS WITH HER UNTIL 10:00. ANYONE TALK TO HER? WE HAVEN'T FOUND HER YET. COME ON, GUYS. GIVE ME SOMETHING SOLID. HOW ABOUT A PRE-NUP AGREEMENT? LEXIS SEARCH TURNED THIS UP. IF THEY DIVORCE SHE GETS NOTHING, BUT IF HE DIES, SHE GETS IT ALL. OLDEST CRIME IN THE BOOKS. MAYBE. WHAT? I AGREE THAT SHE'S A SUSPECT, BUT WE CAN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MOB HIT. NOBODY SAID THIS WAS MOB RELATED. WE COULDN'T GET HIM ON A RICO. LET'S NOT EVEN GO THERE. LET'S STICK WITH WHAT WE GOT. [ chattering ] Man: HEY, BOSS! AL, WHAT'CHA GOT? JUST IN, A JOGGER RUNNING BY THE HOUSE ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER, ABOUT 9:00. THINKS HE SAW A CAR OUTSIDE, THINKS IT WAS BLUE AND THINKS THE PLATE STARTED WITH A "Q" OR AN "O." WELL-- I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. YOU'RE MY BEST INVESTIGATOR. - SNIFF SOMETHING OUT. - I WOULD, EXCEPT THIS CASE STINKS. IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT STINKS, IT'S THE GARBAGE! Man: HOW MANY TIMES IS SHE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL YOU? SHE FOUND HIM DEAD THERE! - AND THE SHOTGUN? - SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. HER ALIBI? FOR THE TENTH TIME, LIEUTENANT, CATHERINE BICKS-AHMED. BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS. SO WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE KNOW!? THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR. NICE GOING, CARMINE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT A "VOLUNTARY INTERVIEW" MEANS? SHE HASN'T VOLUNTEERED ANYTHING. SHE DOESN'T KNOW! OKAY, ANSWER ME THIS, MRS. CARTER, YOU SAID YOU LEFT THE PROMENADE IN ROSEDALE - AT 10:00 SHARP? - YES. YOUR CALL TO 911 CAME IN AT 10:17. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? YOU GIVE HER FIVE MINUTES TO PARK, WALK IN, FIND YOUR HUSBAND, PANIC, SOB AND GRIEVE. THAT ONLY LEAVES 12 MINUTES TO CROSS TOWN. YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE ANYBODY CAN CROSS TOWN - IN 12 MINUTES. - I DRIVE FAST. AND I'M A BUDDHIST MONK! - WHERE'S YOUR SHOTGUN? - I TOLD YOU... I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A SHOTGUN. SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING. THE MAYOR'S COUSIN HAS BEEN MURDERED AND I HAVE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. HOW ABOUT, "GARBAGE MAN LOSES HEAD, IF FOUND, PLEASE RECYCLE"? THAT'S NOT FUNNY, LEWIS. THE GUY WAS CONNECTED TO ORGANIZED CRIME. HE WAS A HOOD. IN QUOTIDIAN ENGLISH, SO WAS ROBIN OF SHERWOOD. BUT NOT TO THE PRESS. SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE PRAGMATIC PREVARICATOR. BOOK HER. EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT! LET ME MAKE SOMETHING PERFECTLY CLEAR, UNTIL I HAVE FURTHER PROOF, OUR POSITION ON THIS CASE IS THAT IS IT NOT MOB RELATED. OH, OKAY. AND THIS IS NOT AN ELECTION YEAR? IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE MORE TIME USING YOUR RICO CONNECTIONS TO GATHER EVIDENCE, THIS WOULDN'T BE A CONCERN, WOULD IT? ANGELA CARTER, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF LUKE CARTER. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. SHE CAME HERE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT... WE'RE RUSHING INTO THIS. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? LOOK AT THE SCENARIO. EXECUTION STYLE SHOT TO THE HEAD. MEN'S SHOE PRINTS IN THE TUNNEL. NO MURDER WEAPON. NO WITNESSES, NO TAPES! THIS COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL HIT FOR ALL WE KNOW. SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR TRACE METALS. A POSITIVE READING YOU CAN GET FROM TOUCHING THE BUMPER OF A CAR! SHE'S GOT NO ALIBI, AND SHE'S GOT MOTIVE. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH. JONAS? I AGREE. BUT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONFUTE WHAT WE DO HAVE TO OUR ADVANTAGE. AND WE'LL CONFIRM THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SIR. LEWIS... MISSY WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE BAIL PROCEEDINGS. WELL-- CONGRATULATIONS. MY CLIENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR. PLEA ENTERED. BAIL MOTIONS? THE PEOPLE REQUEST BAIL BE DENIED DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CRIME. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR! THE NATURE OF THIS CRIME IS BEING CONCOCTED BY THE PEOPLE. BESIDES, MY CLIENT PRESENTS NO FLIGHT RISK AND SHE HAS NO PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD. BAIL WILL BE SET AT $500,000. WHAT? THAT'S EXCESSIVE. MY CLIENT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION-- $500,000, COUNSELOR. THE EXPEDITED TRIAL DATE WILL BE SET TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY. DOES THAT SUIT EVERYONE? SURE. THAT SHOULD PLEASE PHIFER. THE ANSWERS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ARE A LOT CLOSER THAN YOU THINK. WATCH YOURSELF. THAT WAS HIGHLY IMPROPER! - EXCUSE ME? - YOU COMMUNICATED WITH MY CLIENT! BULLSHIT. I'LL HAVE THE COURT TAKE NOTE OF THAT. YOU SAW IT, SHE TALKED TO ME. OH, COUNSELOR. I SEE YOU'RE GETTING PERSONAL WITH THE ACCUSED AGAIN. WANT AN EXCLUSIVE, CLIVE? AN EXCLUSIVE? YEAH. BUT I THOUGHT YOU STILL HARBORED ILL-WILL TOWARDS ME. NO. CHILD MOLESTERS, TOXIC WASTE AND VERMIN-- THOSE I HARBOR ILL-WILL AGAINST. ANYTHING LOWER, I DON'T THINK ABOUT. NOW LISTEN TO ME, YOU SEWER RAT! - YOU LET GO OF ME! - HERE'S THE EXCLUSIVE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT GENARO, OR ME, OR ABOUT ANY COVER UP. YOU DID ENOUGH DAMAGE WITH YOUR VICIOUS LITTLE STORY. SO THIS TIME, THE CASE IS CLEAN AND THERE'LL BE NO DIGGING, OR PERSONAL FILES TO BE BOUGHT. UNDERSTOOD? LISTEN, LEWIS, I'M A JOURNALIST. PEOPLE COVER UP, I EXPOSE. - WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? - YEAH, SURE. WELL, I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT THIS TIME. HAVE A NICE DAY. De Luca: Any objection to the taping? Lawyer: Yes. Angela: No. De Luca: Okay, let's begin. First, may I make a statement? I am innocent. If you come after me, you'll be prosecuting an innocent woman. You'll be convicting an innocent woman. You'll be killing an innocent woman. Can you live with that? Clive: FOR THREE WEEKS NOW, THE CITY HAS BEEN PARALYZED WITH A CRIPPLING GARBAGE STRIKE. EXPERTS SAY THAT THE LACK OF RESOLUTION IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MURDER OF TRASH KING LUKE CARTER. EVER SINCE HIS ESTATE AND BELONGINGS WERE FROZEN, ALL CONTRACT TALKS HAVE STALLED AND POLITICIANS, CITY AND STATEWIDE, ARE AT ODDS OVER WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS EXPLOSIVE IMPASSE. Phifer: I UNDERSTAND. YES. NO, NO. THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION. WE ARE. THANK YOU. WELL-- I'VE JUST BEEN MASTICATED BY THE MATRIARCH OF OUR FAIR CITY. SHE'S RATHER PERTURBED WITH CLIVE JOHNSON'S BROADCAST CONCERNING OUR CASE. SHE'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THE LEAK CAME FROM. WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME! I CAN'T STAND THE WORM. BESIDES, HOW DOES SHE KNOW IT'S AN INTERNAL LEAK? FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, THE BROADCAST MENTIONED A MISSING VIDEO TAPE, A SHOTGUN AND THE BLOOD STAINED TRASH CONTRACT. AND SHE'S BEING RELEASED ON BAIL THIS AFTERNOON. WHAT? HOW? I HAVE NO IDEA. I JUST GOT THE HEADS UP FROM COUNTY 10 MINUTES AGO. CAN'T WE DO ANYTHING RIGHT AROUND HERE? AND WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU TALKING TO HER? I DIDN'T. [ telephone rings ] Secretary on intercom: SIR, IT'S THE MAYOR AGAIN. LEWIS, FIND OUT HOW SHE MADE BAIL. YES, YOUR HONOR, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOUR CIRCEAN CHARMS. YES, WE'RE ON THE LEAK. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE UNDER THE GUN ON THE STRIKE, YES. I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON A LIMB TO ENDORSE MY CANDIDACY. Man: CLIENT PRIVILEGE, COUNSELOR. BEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. YOU REMEMBER THE RICO CASE? WE STILL GOT A LOOSE END. CARTER'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS. FOUND COPIES RIGHT IN HIS BASEMENT. YOU HAVE TERRIBLE HANDWRITING. THAT CASE IS CLOSED. PERJURY AND FRAUD ARE STILL OPTIONS. - IT'LL NEVER STICK. - DOESN'T MATTER. YOU'LL STILL EAT IT. MAYBE LOSE YOUR LICENSE. [ deep sigh ] TELL ME WHAT THE HELL YOU NEED. WAS THE ESTATE BANKRUPT? ARE YOU DA's PRICKS? SO, HOW DID SHE MAKE BAIL THEN? I DON'T KNOW. SHE BORROWED THE MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL ALL OF CARTER'S CASH? LUKE, HE WAS BEING OUSTED BY HIS PARTNER. SO HE TRIED TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY FOR THE CITY BID ON HIS OWN. AND...? HE BORROWED FROM THE WRONG PEOPLE. MEANING? HE BORROWED FROM THE WRONG FUCKING PEOPLE! OH, SHIT! TOOK YOUR EYE OFF THE BALL, DOM! YOU MY FUCKING PRO NOW? NOT EVEN JACK NICKLAUS COULD CURE THAT SLICE. GO ON AHEAD! I'LL CATCH UP AT THE NEXT TEE! SO WHY ARE YOU DISTURBING ME IN MY PLACE OF LEISURE? WE COULD GO DOWN TO THE 6th STREET PRECINCT COFFEE SHOP, THEY GOT SOME REALLY STRONG JAVA DOWN THERE. [ sighs ] SO, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? LUKE CARTER. YEAH, I HEARD. FUCKING TRAGIC. IS IT? WORD IS HE HAD TO BORROW FROM YOU TO SECURE THE TRASH CONTRACT AND COULDN'T PAY YOU BACK. COUNSELOR, OUR BUSINESS TODAY IS MORE CORPORATE. WE COLLECT DEBTS ON FORECLOSURES, SEIZURES AND TAKEOVERS. NOT MURDER. THAT BEHAVIOR... IS FOR THE ANIMALS IN JERSEY. AH. DOMENICO "THE HUMANIST" VITTORIO, NOW, EH? YOU FUCKING GUYS. YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. SURE, LUKE AND ME WAS IN BUSINESS. BUT HE WAS MY FRIEND FOR 20 YEARS! ANYONE NOT SO FRIENDLY? I COULD FIND OUT FOR YOU. YOU DO THAT. HEY. YOU WANT MY TAKE? YEAH, DOM, PLEASE. SPARE NO DETAIL. LAST WEEK, ME AND LUKE, CORNER TABLE, GOLDEN BEAVER CLUB, BOTTLE OF CHIVAS, BLACK SNATCH DANCING HER SILICONE TITTIES IN OUR FACE. HE TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA DIVORCE HIS WIFE'S BITCH ASS. DETAILED ENOUGH FOR YOU? HE SAY WHY? HE THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA HAVE HIM GREASED. WHAT? HE FOUND OUT ABOUT AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT SHE'D TAKEN OUT IN HIS NAME LAST YEAR. THANKS, DOM. [ videotape playing ] - Then you called the police? - Yes. - And then you pulled him out? - Yes. Tell me this, Mrs. Carter, if you called the police first, then why was there pool water on the floor? Maybe the sequence is wrong. Maybe I, um... - pulled him out-- - Do you mean after you shot him? Lawyer: Objection! Come on! You're deliberately leading her, trying to extort an admission from her. I didn't do it. I didn't. WHAT'S GOING ON? SHE AGREED TO A POLYGRAPH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION. AND SHECK IS ALLOWING THIS? OH, SHE INSISTED. WHY? Missy: SHE SAID YOU COULD TELL US. WELL? I HAVE NO IDEA. ARE YOU SURE? YES, I'M SURE. WHATEVER. IT BODES GREGARIOUS FOR OUR SIDE. IF NOT ALL TOGETHER EGREGIOUS. YEAH. - SHECK. - HM, COUNSELOR. THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THREE-PHASED. FIRST, A DIRECT, NO FORMAT INTERROGATION. ANYTHING GOES. THEN EVERYONE LEAVES AND WE DO A SEPARATE, STANDARDIZED POLYGRAPH TEST. WHEN THAT'S OVER, I'LL ADMINISTER A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBE TO GET A PROFILE ON MRS. CARTER. AND THE REASON FOR THIS ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE IS WHAT, DR. FARMER? IT'S A NEW TREND IN POLYGRAPH PROFILE TESTING. USES NORMALIZATION OF SINE AND COTANGENT CURVES WHICH HELPS GIVE APPROPRIATE WEIGHT TO SUBJECTIVITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS. OKAY? SURE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY GIVING THIS DEPOSITION YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PROTECTION UNDER THE 5th AMENDMENT? YES. Doctor: OKAY, I'LL ASK THREE TEST QUESTIONS TO SET UP THE VARIANCE RANGE. PLEASE ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION "NO." IS YOUR NAME ANGELA CARTER? YES. IS YOUR NAME ANGELA CARTER? NO. WERE YOU MARRIED TO LUKE CARTER? YES. Missy: DID YOU MURDER YOUR HUSBAND? REALLY, COUNSELOR. IF THIS IS GONNA BE FOR SHOCK VALUE-- SHE VOLUNTEERED. LEONARD, IT'S OKAY. NO, I DID NOT KILL LUKE. DID YOU KILL YOUR PREVIOUS HUSBAND? - REALLY, COUNSELOR. - FINE. ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOUR PREVIOUS MARRIAGE LEFT YOU FINANCIALLY UPSIDE DOWN? YES, I FILED BANKRUPTCY. DID YOU MARRY LUKE CARTER FOR HIS MONEY? NO. DID YOU HAVE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON YOUR HUSBAND'S LIFE THIS TIME? NO. WOULD YOU SAY YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR HUSBAND WAS BAD? NO. YOU ARGUED, DIDN'T YOU? ALL COUPLES DO. HOW MUCH? LIKE NORMAL, I SUPPOSE. DID IT GET PHYSICAL? PHYSICAL? - DID HE HIT YOU? - SOMETIMES. DID YOU EVER CALL THE POLICE? IT NEVER GOT THAT FAR. WE ALWAYS WORKED IT OUT. REALLY? THEN WHY DID HE WANT A DIVORCE? I THINK YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT HIS DEATH? - IT WAS AWFUL. - AWFUL? YOU HAVE ADMITTED BEING IN A BAD, PHYSICALLY DANGEROUS RELATIONSHIP. - THAT DOESN'T MEAN-- - YOU DESPISED HIM... OKAY, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OBJECT NOW. ...THAT YOU HATED YOUR HUSBAND, REALLY, COUNSELOR, THIS CONDUCT IS ABSOLUTELY-- DIDN'T YOU HATE LUKE CARTER? YES. ENOUGH TO WANT HIM DEAD? YES. LET ME ASK YOU AGAIN, DID YOU KILL HIM? NO. DID YOU WANT TO KILL HIM? NO. LUKE WAS A VERY RICH AND DANGEROUS MAN WHOSE MONEY WAS-- THE ESTATE WAS BANKRUPT. THEN YOU KILLED HIM BECAUSE YOU HATED HIM? I WOULDN'T KILL SOMEONE BECAUSE I HATED THEM. MAYBE I'D WANT TO KILL THEM BECAUSE THEY FELT INDIFFERENCE. LIKE THE INDIFFERENCE MR. LEWIS FEELS TOWARDS YOU. SEE? NOW YOU FEEL LIKE KILLING. CARE TO TRY THE MACHINE? ARE YOU AND TAYLOR INVOLVED? NO. I'M SORRY, WHAT DOES THIS PERTAIN TO EXACTLY? I THINK WE CAN PROCEED TO THE SECOND PHASE OF THE POLYGRAPH. THANK YOU. Doctor: IS THIS YOUR NUMBER? YES. WELL? Doctor: SMOOTH AS SILK. EVERY TRACER, TO EVERY QUESTION IN THE FIRST OR SECOND PHASE IS THE SAME. SHE STUNG THE MACHINE! Phifer: HOW THE HELL DID SHE DO THAT? Doctor. EXPERIENCE. SOMEHOW, SOMEWHERE, SHE GOT THE EXPERIENCE. FROM WHERE? SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD, DOES SHE? Doctor: SHE STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY. SOME LAB CURRICULUMS HAVE POLYGRAPH STUDIES. WHAT ABOUT THE PSYCH EVALUATION? SHE'S WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. MEANING? HER PROFILE SHOWS SHE'S NO MORE PATHOLOGICAL THAN YOU OR ME. IT'S ALL I COULD COME UP WITH, GUYS. NOTHING MORE TO SAY. I'LL HAVE A REPORT FOR YOU BY DAY'S END. Missy: SHE KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN. SHE KNEW IT WOULD JUMBLE EVERYTHING. SHE'S SETTING US UP. [ telephone rings ] HELLO. Taylor, hi, it's Al. I've run into a wall on this insurance. THERE'S NO RECORD ANY PLACE OF ANY POLICY. IT'S GOTTA BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. WHAT ABOUT CATHERINE? SHE HASN'T BEEN BACK TO HER PLACE FOR TWO DAYS. OH, WELL. KEEP ON IT. YEAH, I WILL. HEY, MAX. HOW'S THE FOOD? IT'S OKAY. TELL ME... WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT TEST? SHE... PASSED. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S IT? COME ON, I KNOW YOU. LEVEL WITH ME. OKAY, SHE WAS MANIPULATING ME. I COULDN'T QUITE GET A READ ON HER EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SHE'S VERY GOOD AT MASKING REALITY. MAKING YOU THINK THINGS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THEY APPEAR. IT'S CALLED FOCUS TRANSFER. HEAD GAMES. THEY'RE SECOND NATURE TO HER. SHE'D BE VERY DANGEROUS TO ANYONE WITH LESS CONTROL. WHAT, LIKE ME? IT'S BAD ENOUGH SHE'S DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS. - UNLESS YOU KNOW--- - MAX, MAX, MAX... I CAN HANDLE IT. FINE. I GOT A REPORT TO FINISH. FOLLOW THAT BIKE! [ horn blares ] STICK WITH THE BIKE. [ bike engine revving ] ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL YOU BACK. HI, BABY. SEAN, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I JUST TALKED TO CATHERINE. OH, YEAH. SHE DID FILL ME IN ON SOME... VERY INTERESTING THINGS... ABOUT LUKE'S DEATH, ABOUT THE MONEY. ARE YOU HOLDING OUT ON ME, BABY? NO. GOOD. I HAVE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE... UNDER CONTROL. SO JUST BACK OFF. OKAY. FOR NOW. BUT DON'T FORGET, I'M HERE FOR YOU. - HER ALIBI IS IN TOWN? - YUP. - HOW DO YOU KNOW? - I SAW HER. - WHEN? - EARLIER TODAY. ON FAYETTE STREET. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE? SHOPPING. WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL IT IN? I WASN'T SURE IT WAS HER. - WHERE IS SHE NOW? - I DON'T KNOW. I WAS FOLLOWING HER IN A CAB AND I LOST HER. LEWIS, THIS IS A SERIOUS BREACH OF PROTOCOL. - WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US? - HELL, I'M TELLING YOU NOW. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SHARE? YEAH. DOMENICO VITTORIO TOLD ME MRS. CARTER HAS AN INSURANCE POLICY ON LUKE. - YOU'RE KIDDING? - WELL, IT'S NOT CONFIRMED. WELL, GET ON IT, MAN! SHE DID IT. SURE AS I'M STANDING HERE. - PINKY'S, HUH? - YUP. A FRIEND OF THE COURTHOUSE CONFIRMED HE PUT UP - THE SCHMOE FOR MRS. C. - HE IN THERE? NOPE, ON THE COAST RETRIEVING A RUNAWAY. - SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? - WATCH. CLARABELLE D'ONOFRIO. SHE'S ALWAYS HAD A THING FOR ME. I SURE HOPE WHAT WE FIND IS WORTH THE EVENING I PROMISED HER. THAT'S BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY. YEAH, YEAH. SHE'S ON AN HOUR LUNCH. DOOR'S OPEN. [ telephone rings ] Recording: You've reached Pinky's Bonds. Please leave a message after the beep. [ beep ] [ dial tone ] ANYTHING? YEAH, A FEW CARTERS-- IN CANTON, NEWBURY, LAKELAND-- NOT THE ONE WE'RE LOOKING FOR. SHE'LL BE BACK ANY MINUTE NOW. LOOKS LIKE WE HIT A BRICK WALL HERE. YEAH, SORRY, BOSS. IT'S YOU I FEEL SORRY FOR. LISTEN, UM-- I NEED YOU TO CHECK SOMEONE OUT FOR ME. HIS NAME IS SEAN MALLOY, HE WORKS IN A BIKE SHOP DOWN ON 13th AVENUE. SOMETHING I NEED TO KNOW HERE? I'M NOT SURE YET. JUST GO DOWN THERE AND SEE WHAT HE COUGHS UP. I'LL ASK DE LUCA TO CHECK IF HE HAS A RAP SHEET. Recording: You've reached Pinky's Bonds. Please leave a message after the beep. [ beep ] Man: Yes, this is a message for Dick Pinkerton. Please call Del Harris at Maple Leaf Insurance about the collateral for the $500,000 bond. You can reach me at [514] 555-2374. [ beep ] MONTREAL! Phifer: DID WE GET NUMBERS ON IT? YEAH, $15 MILLION POLICY. CANADIAN. - THAT'S $10 MILLION, U.S. - THIS MONEY SAVES HER NECK. THAT'S HOW SHE MADE BAIL. SHE BORROWED AGAINST AN ACCRUED VALUE OF JUST OVER $600,000. HOW DID WE MISS THIS? COMPANY WAS OUT OF MONTREAL. WE HAD NO WAY TO TRACE IT. SHE KNEW IT, TOO. Taylor: FRITKIN-- LUKE'S PARTNER. WOULD YOU LOOK INTO THAT? Missy: WE GOT A STATEMENT. THEY WERE TRYING TO OUST EACH OTHER. BUT HE'S GOT A SOLID ALIBI AND ALL THE OTHER LEADS GO NOWHERE, LEAVING ONLY HER. MAYBE. WHEN WE FIRST MET, THE THING I ADMIRED MOST ABOUT YOU, WAS YOUR CAPACITY TO LOOK PAST ALL DOUBTS, ALL CONFLICTING EVIDENCE, AND FOCUS IN ON A CONVICTION. I GUESS THINGS HAVE CHANGED. I'M SORRY IT'S COME TO THIS BETWEEN US. WE'RE DISCUSSING A CASE HERE. I REMEMBER WHEN WE COULDN'T FIND TIME TO DISCUSS THEM. SHE'S SO WRONG FOR YOU. MISSY, SHE'S A SUSPECT IN A MURDER TRIAL. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CAN'T SAVE HER IF SHE'S GUILTY! - I KNOW THAT. - AND YOU'VE GOT TO TRY IT LIKE SHE IS! - I AM! - THAT'S CRAP. SHE'S PULLING YOUR STRINGS. LETTING WHAT HAPPENED TO GENARO-- DON'T GO THERE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT GENARO. THAT WAS ANOTHER MISTAKE WE MADE. THANKS FOR POINTING THAT OUT. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. Clive: WITH THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS HAVING BEEN COMPLETED OVER THE WEEKEND, THEY'RE READY TO SET IN MOTION WHAT PROMISES TO BE A SWIFT CASE AGAINST ANGELA CARTER, WIFE OF THE DECEASED, IN HOPES OF RESOLVING THE DEADLOCK. PROSECUTION EVIDENCE GATHERING HAS BEEN METICULOUS, ACCORDING TO STATE'S ATTORNEY JONAS PHIFER, WHO INSISTS THEY HAVE A TREASURE TROVE OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEIR CLAIMS. GOOD NEWS. THE CANADIANS ARE TURNING OVER ALL THE INSURANCE PAPERWORK. HMM? HELLO? SORRY. WHAT'S GOT YOU SO CAPTIVATED? I'M NOT SURE. MAYBE IT'S THE WAY LUKE WAS KILLED. I DON'T FOLLOW. WELL, WAXMAN'S REPORT SAYS HE HAD THE CRAP BEATEN OUT OF HIM. SO? SO, LUKE WAS A BIG GUY. CAN YOU SEE ANGELA CARTER ROUGHING HIM UP? CHOKING HIM? BREAKING A RIB? AND HE DIDN'T FIGHT BACK. SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SCRATCH ON HER. SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK NOW? WELL, IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY. MISSY, TAYLOR, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? FINE. YOU ALL READY FOR THE BIG ROLL OUT? WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? - CRUCIFY HER! - EXCUSE ME? DEFILE HER AS A WOMAN. VITIATE HER AS A HUMAN BEING. [ whispering ] GET A LIFE. Judge: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THIS JURY, THIS CASE IS NOW IN ITS PRESENTATION STAGE. YOU HAVE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS. THE PEOPLE WILL COMMENCE WITH THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS. MR. LEWIS? YES. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. LUKE CARTER... WAS MURDERED... WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT. THE MOTIVE, DESPITE ALL APPEARANCES AND SUGGESTIONS OTHERWISE, WAS SIMPLE: GREED; A $10,000,000 INSURANCE POLICY. DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL WE WILL SHOW YOU... HOW THE CARTER MARRIAGE HAD DEGENERATED INTO A SERIES OF UGLY... VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS. SO... WHY DIDN'T SHE DIVORCE HIM? BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE LEFT PENNILESS. INSTEAD, SHE TOOK OUT AN INSURANCE POLICY IN HIS NAME, MURDERED HIM AND THEN TRIED TO COVER IT UP. BUT IN THE END, WHEN ALL THE EVIDENCE IS WEIGHED, YOU WILL SEE THERE ARE NO OTHER LEADS, NO OTHER SUSPECTS, BECAUSE THE MURDERER... IS SITTING... HERE... IN FRONT OF YOU. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MR. SHECK, DO YOU WISH TO MAKE YOUR STATEMENT NOW? YES. YES, YOUR HONOR, I DO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, - I MUST BEGIN BY-- - HOLD ON, COUNSEL. MRS. CARTER, AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU WISH TO RELAY THIS MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE? YES, YOUR HONOR-- ACTUALLY, MR. LEWIS. YOUR HONOR, I HAVE TO OBJECT! - TO YOUR CLIENT? - COUNSEL IS TRYING TO SABOTAGE THIS CASE! DON'T BE RIDICULOUS! - [ gavel bangs ] - I AM WARNING THE BOTH OF YOU, ANOTHER OUTBURST LIKE THAT AND YOU'D BETTER GET OUT YOUR CHECKBOOKS. MRS. CARTER, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YES, YOUR HONOR. EVEN THOUGH THE CONTENTS OF THIS NOTE COULD INCRIMINATE YOU IN THIS TRIAL? - I KNOW. - VERY WELL. I HAVE NO PRECEDENTS TO BAR THIS, BUT IT WILL BE NOTED. BAILIFF. YOUR HONOR, I HAVE TO OBJECT. I HAVE MADE MY RULING. A PERSONAL NOTE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE. YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE DISCLOSURE ISSUES HERE. ONLY BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR CLIENT, MR. SHECK. NOW PROCEED. IN AN UNPRECEDENTED TRIAL OCCURRENCE, MRS. CARTER PASSED WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A PERSONAL NOTE TO DEPUTY STATE'S ATTORNEY TAYLOR LEWIS. AT THIS TIME, THE CONTENTS OF THE NOTE HAVE NOT BEEN DISCLOSED. AS OUR VIEWERS MAY REMEMBER, THIS REPORTER LAST YEAR DID AN EXPOSE ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONABLE METHODS USED BY THE STATE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN THE CASE OF KAREN GENARO. ALTHOUGH THE CASE WAS SEALED BY A JUDGE AND NO EVIDENCE EVER SURFACED CONCERNING THE ALLEGATIONS, THE EVENTS OF TODAY CAN ONLY CAST A FURTHER PALL ON THE REPUTATION OF MR. LEWIS AND THE ENTIRE STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. GREAT, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. AH, CARMINE, WHAT'CHA GOT? OKAY-- SEAN MALLOY-- MANAGED CARTER'S BIKE SHOP FOR THREE YEARS NOW. SOME CREDIT ISSUES, A BANKRUPTCY, YADA YADA YADA. GIVE THAT TO MISSY. RAPS: SPEEDING TICKETS, ILLEGAL HANDGUN POSSESSION CHARGE, A DWI, ASSAULT CHARGES FILED BY ONE LUKE CARTER. WHAT? NOVEMBER 6, LAST YEAR. DROPPED TWO DAYS LATER. - HE STILL KEPT HIS JOB? - YEAH, HOW DOES A GUY DO THAT? PFFTH-- YOU CARE TO TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND HIM? THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. YEAH, AND I'M AN IDIOT SAVANT. GIVE ME DETAILS OR YOU DON'T EVEN GET AN ADDRESS. THANK YOU, CARMINE. I'M WARNING YOU, LEWIS. I'M NOT GONNA HELP YOU ON THIS. TELL THE JUDGE I WILL FAX HIM A COPY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Missy: SHE KNOWS YOU. SHE'S PLAYING WITH YOU. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS YET. THIS IS A WOMAN WHO BOUGHT INSURANCE POLICIES ON TWO HUSBANDS JUST ONE YEAR BEFORE THEY DIED! WE KNEW SHE BEAT THE POLYGRAPH ABOUT THE INSURANCE ISSUE. THAT TAKES PLANNING AND SHE'S BRILLIANT AT THAT! WHAT ELSE IS SHE LYING ABOUT? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE. YEAH, WELL, PHIFER WANTS TO SEE YOU UPSTAIRS NOW. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT! GOOD! TELL THE JUDGE "THANK YOU." I'LL PICK UP THE WARRANTS ON THE WAY OUT. OH, GREAT. THANK YOU. "YOU SCUM-SUCKING PIG." "YOU'LL BE CASTRATED BEFORE YOU CAN BLEED TO DEATH. YOU WILL CHOKE ON YOUR DICK." POPULAR GUY. CHECK THESE OUT. HE WAS IN FOR 600 G's. LOOKS LIKE HE LEFT HER WITH SOME BAGGAGE. JUST LIKE HER LAST HUSBAND. I'LL HAVE BAILEY CHECK OUT THESE IOUs. THE MAYOR IS GONNA HAVE A COW. IF I WERE YOU, I'D WORRY ABOUT WHAT PHIFER IS GONNA SAY. SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S DIVULGING EVIDENCE TO US? THAT WILL DESTROY OUR CASE. I WILL BE CRUCIFIED IN THE MEDIA. FROM THIS POINT ON, YOU STAY AWAY. - DO YOU HEAR ME, LEWIS? - I GOT EARS. WELL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, USE WHAT'S BETWEEN THEM. SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE BOX? IT MIGHT BE JUST ANOTHER SMOKE SCREEN. I THINK MISSY'S RIGHT. WE HAVE TO REGURGITATE ON THIS ONE. YEAH, WELL I FEEL LIKE THROWING UP MYSELF. OH, GODDAMN IT, I'M TIRED OF YOUR SHIT! WE'VE GOT A FIDUCIARY DUTY HERE! YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DO! BUT HOW DO WE KNOW HE STILL OWED ON THOSE NOTES? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO WROTE THE LETTERS! AT THIS POINT, WITHOUT LOOKING INTO IT, IT WILL JUST START MORE RUMORS ABOUT THE MAYOR'S COUSIN. - WE DON'T WANT THAT. - I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I CANNOT WITHHOLD EVIDENCE AGAIN! LEWIS, ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT. PUT ALL YOUR PEOPLE ON IT. EVERYBODY. QUICKLY. UNTIL WE KNOW MORE, NOTHING IS TO BE DISCLOSED. - JONAS, I CAN'T DO THIS. - LEWIS, PLEASE. GOD HELP ME. MRS. SUMMERS, COULD YOU PLEASE TELL THE JURY, WHAT YOU OBSERVED JUST THREE DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER? FIRST UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS NOT PEEPING. THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW. WHAT WITH THE RECENT EVENTS WE EVEN LISTED OUR HOUSE FOR SALE. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. HIGH SOCIETY'S MORALITY IS NOT ON TRIAL HERE. SUSTAINED. MRS. SUMMERS, PROCEED. I WAS WATCHING PBS, AND I HEARD YELLING AND SCREAMING NEXT DOOR. SO I WENT TO THE WINDOW AND MRS. CARTER WAS LYING ON THE TILE, BESIDE THE POOL. MR. CARTER HAD PUSHED HER DOWN VERY HARD-- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR! SHE NEVER ACTUALLY WITNESSED HIM PUSH HER. SUSTAINED. CONTINUE. ANYWAY, SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR, AND HE STARTED LAUGHING. SO SHE BEGAN... SCREAMING VULGARITIES AT HIM, AND THEN SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM. WHAT DID SHE SAY EXACTLY? "I'M GOING TO BLOW YOUR... BLANKING HEAD OFF, YOU SON OF A BLANK." YOU COULD FILL IN THE BLANKS YOURSELVES. AND HIS RESPONSE? HE STARTED YELLING BACK. HE SAID, "I KNOW ABOUT THE INSURANCE." AND HE KNEW THAT SHE WANTED HIM DEAD. THEN WHAT? THEN HE WENT INSIDE AND CAME BACK WITH A SHOTGUN. AT THIS POINT I WAS THINKING, "OH, LORDY, HE'S GONNA SHOOT HER!" - DID HE? - NO. WHAT HAPPENED? HE HANDED HER THE SHOTGUN. I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I COULDN'T MOVE. AND HE WAS... CHALLENGING HER TO DO IT, TO SHOOT HIM. AND I COULD SEE HER TREMBLING WITH RAGE. AND THEN... SUDDENLY... AND NOTHING. AND HE STARTED LAUGHING LIKE A MANIAC. SO SHE ACTUALLY PULLED THE TRIGGER? SHE DID. THANK YOU, MRS. SUMMERS. Clive: THIS WEEK'S PROCEEDINGS WENT INTO WEEKEND RECESS EARLY TODAY AFTER SENSATIONAL TESTIMONY BY VERA SUMMERS. TESTIMONY, COMBINED WITH THE OTHER EVIDENCE, WHICH MANY EXPERTS SAY IS SO DAMAGING TO MRS. CARTER THAT THE DEFENSE MAY HAVE TO RETHINK ITS POSITION. Missy: TELL ME WHY WE'RE HERE AGAIN? Taylor: I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED. SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. SHE SHOT HIM POINT BLANK. TRACE METAL TEST SHOWS IT. VERA SUMMER'S TESTIMONY TODAY DISPUTES THAT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I SUPPOSE IF SHE HANDLED THE GUN JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE IT COULD BE THAT. JESUS, YOU'RE WORKING HARDER AT HER DEFENSE THAN SHECK. I JUST WANT TO BE SURE. INDULGE ME, PLEASE. EARL? [ gun cocks ] OKAY? IF YOU WANT TO RECONSTRUCT THIS ACCURATELY, STAND OVER THERE. - HERE? - YEAH. AIM THIS AT HIS CHIN. MUCH CLOSER. CLOSER. CLOSER. WOW. I KNOW. THAT'S WHAT MY ESTIMATES SHOW. SHE COULDN'T MISS FROM HERE. [ hammer clicks ] Missy: WHAT? WHAT IS IT? MANNY-- HE WROTE THE IOUs. GOOD WORK. DA's OFFICE. MANNY? I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING LUKE CARTER. [ Russian accent ] PLEASE, SIT. LET ME GET YOU A DRINK, HM? YOU LIKE VODKA? OF COURSE YOU DO. [ Manny yelling ] Al: I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OH! WHOA. [ grunting ] YOU WANT TO DANCE? OW! [ shattering ] - FUCK YOU. - EVERYBODY OUT! DA's OFFICE! I SAID EVERYBODY OUT! TAKE IT EASY. I JUST WANT TO TALK. SHOW ME A WARRANT, ASSHOLE! I'M NOT HERE TO PLAY GAMES. I COULD HAVE THIS PLACE CRAWLING IN BLUES IN A HEARTBEAT. I'M CLEAN. WELL, I GOT THESE THAT SAY OTHERWISE. FUCK THAT BITCH! SO HE WASN'T PAYING HIS DEBTS? NO, HE WASN'T FUCKING PAYING UP! HE HAD US BY THE BALLS. CARTER HAD YOU BY THE BALLS? NO, PHIFER! LUKE DIDN'T WANT ANY OTHER RICO CASES COMING DOWN. PHIFER? THESE ARE PHIFER'S DEBTS? WHO THE FUCK DID YOU THINK? HE OWED LUKE FOR OVER A YEAR, BUT... WAIT A MINUTE. YOU GUYS HAD IT BACKWARDS! - THE INQUISITOR? - OR PROSECUTOR. TRY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. DICKHEAD. OH, THIS IS TOO BIZARRE. YOU HEARD HIM. YOU REALLY THINK PHIFER--? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT. McMANUS IS A LOW-LIFE SCUMBAG WHO'D LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO IMPLICATE HIM. MANNY WORKED FOR CARTER. THAT'S WHY THE NOTES WERE IN THE BOX. IT ALL ADDS UP UNLESS SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT IT TO. - LIKE WHO? - LIKE PHIFER! LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS EVERYTHING TO LOSE BY THIS DISCOVERY! THAT'S A BIG LEAP. ANY BIGGER THAN ANGELA CARTER KILLING LUKE FOR HIS MONEY? - BUT JONAS, HE SAID-- - SAID WHAT? SAID SOMETHING? WHAT, ABOUT ME? ABOUT CARTER? HE SAID YOU WERE THE REASON THE RICO PROBE STALLED. THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH HER BACK THEN. SON OF A BITCH. AND YOU BELIEVED HIM? YEAH! NO! I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE! CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR? CAN YOU RUN A CREDIT CHECK ON PHIFER? WHAT WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST A HUNCH I'VE GOT. CAN YOU DO IT? WITHOUT TELLING HIM? THANKS, MISSY. MRS. GEIGER, YOU'RE IN THE THAI PLANT. I'M JUST MAKING SURE ALL IS KOSHER. I LET YOUR SISTER IN WITH THE SPARE KEY YOU KEEP UNDER THE MAT. MY SISTER? YEAH, SHE SHOWED UP ON A FANCY SHMANCY, YELLOW TRIUMPH DAYTONA. FUEL INJECTED, THREE CYLINDER, WATER COOLED OVERHEAD CAM, LATEST TECHNOLOGY. SO, I LET HER PARK IN THE BACK. THANKS, MRS. GEIGER. OH, MY SON'S IN A CLUB. MAYBE SHE'D LIKE TO MEET HIM. I BET THEY'D HIT IT OFF. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DID YOU FIND THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX? - YES, WE DID. - DID YOU MAKE THE CONTENTS PUBLIC? - NO. - WHY NOT? - YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE. - I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME. I CAN'T BE HERE. I CAN'T GO HOME. I WON'T GO TO JAIL. WHERE THE HELL SHOULD I GO ANYWAY? I DON'T CARE. I'M YOUR PROSECUTOR. YOU'RE ALSO THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS I'M INNOCENT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I SAW YOU TRYING TO MANIPULATE MISSY AT THE POLYGRAPH TEST. YOU'RE PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. DON'T. ARE YOU THAT FAR GONE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH ANYMORE? WHEN I WALKED IN, LUKE WAS ALREADY DEAD. THERE WERE PICTURES EVERYWHERE. WHAT PICTURES? OF ME AND SEAN MALLOY. SEAN MALLOY? IT WAS AN AFFAIR WE HAD SIX MONTHS AGO. ROUND ABOUT THE TIME YOU BOUGHT LUKE'S INSURANCE POLICY? HE MADE ME FEEL GOOD. LIKE A WOMAN, OKAY? WHEN I ENDED IT HE DIDN'T TAKE IT TOO WELL - AND HE BECAME OBSESSED. - OH, SO HE DID IT NOW? - NO. - HOW DO YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. WE DIDN'T FIND ANY PICTURES. - OF COURSE NOT, I TOOK THEM. - WHY? BECAUSE I WALKED IN AND I PICKED UP THE SHOTGUN! THEN I REALIZED THE MISTAKE I HAD MADE-- THE PRINTS, THE BLOOD, THE PICTURES EVERYWHERE. IT LOOKED LIKE I HAD DONE IT, WITH MOTIVE. SO INSTEAD YOU TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE HAD DONE IT. MOB HITS GO MOSTLY UNSOLVED. YOU TAMPERED WITH EVIDENCE. IT BEATS MURDER. [ telephone ringing ] YEAH? It's Missy. Catherine's dead. - WHAT? - They found her an hour ago. - AHEM! - HANG ON. RIGOR MORTIS PUTS HER TIME OF DEATH BETWEEN TWO AND SIX HOURS AGO. PRELIMINARILY, IT LOOKS LIKE STRANGULATION. PRINT WORK'S GONE TO THE LAB. - Was there anything on her? - WAS THERE ANYTHING ON HER? THEY'RE STILL LOOKING. THANKS. CATHERINE IS DEAD. OH, NO! OH, NO. OKAY-- WHERE'S THE TAPE? WHERE'S THE SHOTGUN? LOOK, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, AFTER TODAY'S TESTIMONY AND THE RECENT DEMISE OF YOUR ONLY ALIBI, YOU ARE IN AN OCEAN OF DEEP DARK SHIT. IF I WERE YOU I'D BE A LITTLE MORE FORTHCOMING ROUND ABOUT NOW. ANGELA, WHERE ARE THEY? [ sighs ] Angela: CATHERINE'S STUDIO. NICE HOUSEKEEPING. LET ME GUESS. GONE. [ front door opens, footsteps ] [ screaming ] - MISSY. MISSY. - DAMN YOU! YOU SCARED ME! WHAT THE HELL...? FOR ALL YOU KNOW, SHE COULD HAVE KILLED CATHERINE! I WAS WITH HER ALL EVENING. WHAT IS IT? ARE YOU IN LOVE? WHAT? IT'S COMPLICATED. LIKE HELL IT IS! YOU'RE TRAIPSING AROUND WITH A MURDER SUSPECT! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? I HAVE A THEORY AND I'M TRYING TO PROVE IT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS UNETHICAL. MAYBE, BUT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH. THERE'S SOMETHING ROTTEN ON OUR SIDE AND I'M NOT GETTING ANY ANSWERS FROM ANYONE. SO YOU GO TO HER? I CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THAT "POOR PITIFUL GIRL" ACT, IT DOESN'T FOOL ME ONE BIT. AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE, IF YOU'RE GUILTY, I'LL GET YOU. I WILL. I KNOW. SHE REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU. LET'S GO. [ car alarm blaring ] [ woman yelling ] You've reached Al Bailey's mobile voice mail. Please leave a message. HI, AL. I'M TAKING ANGELA CARTER TO THE COMFORT INN ON 6th. I NEED YOU TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER FOR ME. CALL ME. [ grunting ] Thug: Oh, Mr. Carter... [ chuckles ] seems like you owe my boss a little change, - and we've come to collect. - Get lost, all right? [ grunts ] HOLD ONTO YOUR HATS, LADIES AND GERMS-- Thug: Here's the message: My boss was kind enough to give you the money, so you could win that city contract. Now it's past due. Just tell him I ain't got it, all right? I'll talk to Dom, tomorrow, okay? Oh, okay. [ grunts ] Hey, a little gift from Dom. That's Mr. Vittorio. You don't seem to understand. It's the change, tomorrow, or it's buckwheats, o-tay? What the--? [ laughing ] [ screams ] Phifer: What the hell is going on? What is so goddamn important that you would call me here? SON OF A BITCH. I need the 600 K you're into me for. Didn't we talk about this? Look, it's Vittorio, okay? I'm in deep. I gotta have the money. The way I see it, I don't owe you a penny, and if you don't watch yourself, you're gonna have another RICO investigation up your ass. Luke, if you can't look after your debts, that's not my problem. - You owe me-- - That's just-- You owe me! What are you doing? [ panting ] [ moaning ] [ panting ] DAMN YOU, WHERE IS SHE? WHERE? [ spits ] [ touchtone beeps ] [ Lewis' message ] Al, I'm taking Angela Carter to the Comfort Inn on 6th. I need you to keep an eye on her for me. Call me. Angela: SO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH KAREN GENARO? OH, IT WAS A SENSATIONAL CASE. KAREN GENARO WAS A DRUG ADDICT. CRYSTAL METH. BOTH SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE ADDICTED TO IT. ONE EVENING, A JUNKIE FRIEND WALKS IN AND FINDS KAREN'S HUSBAND AND THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS STABBED TO DEATH. MULTIPLE WOUNDS. BLOOD EVERYWHERE. KAREN WAS IN BED, THE KNIFE BESIDE HER. SHE WAS HIGH AS A KITE. COULDN'T REMEMBER A THING EXCEPT SOME DREAM SHE HAD IN WHICH SHE WAS FIGHTING OFF SOME WOMAN SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THE REAL KILLER? YUP... HER HUSBAND'S LOVER, ALSO A JUNKIE. WHEN DID YOU KNOW? DURING THE TRIAL, MISSY AND I GOT A TIP OFF FROM A BACKSTREET HEROIN DEALER. IT WAS SUCH BAD TIMING. WE WERE ON A ROLL. EVERYONE WANTED A CONVICTION INCLUDING ME. SO I... IGNORED IT. TWO WEEKS LATER, THE KILLER WALKS INTO A POLICE STATION AND CONFESSES. DNA TESTS CONFIRMED IT. IN THE MEANTIME, KAREN GENARO HAD BEEN MURDERED IN PRISON. CLIVE JOHNSON, A REPORTER, GOT WIND, DECIDED TO PLAY DIRTY. HE PAID SOMEONE TO GET MY PERSONAL FILE. IN IT WAS A FAVOR I HAD DONE FOR MY FATHER A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK, WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED FOR SOLICITING AFTER A DRUNKEN NIGHT OUT WITH THE GUYS. CLIVE DID AN EXPOSE ON... THE BREAKS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE STATE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ROUTINELY GOT AND MENTIONED MY FATHER'S NAME. IT BROKE MY MOTHER'S HEART. YOU SHOULDN'T BLAME YOURSELF FOR WHAT HAPPENED. YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? RIGHT AND WRONG ARE JUST A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE? YEAH. WHEN SOMEONE LIKE PHIFER CRAWLS INTO BED WITH SOMEONE LIKE LUKE, PERSPECTIVE GOES OUT THE WINDOW. THEY USED YOU. JUST LIKE THEY USED YOU ON LUKE'S INVESTIGATION. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? GAMBLING DEBTS, CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? EITHER WILL KILL A RICO PROBE. WHAT? IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE. WELL, NOT TO ME, IT ISN'T. YOU WERE THE PERFECT SOLDIER. RALLIER OF THE TROOPS. GREAT RECORD. I MEAN, IF THE CASE STALLED WHO WOULD QUESTION YOUR EFFORTS? EVEN NOW. FUCK ME. I ALREADY DID. YOU'RE A DECENT MAN. NOT PERFECT, BUT DECENT. THERE MUST BE A MORE SOLID TRAIL TO PHIFER. THE CONTRIBUTIONS-- WHO KNEW ABOUT THEM? HMM, FRITKIN. LET'S PAY HIM A VISIT. I'LL CHECK OUT AND MEET YOU AT THE CAR. - HI, BABY. - [ Angela screams ] SEAN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THINGS ARE HEATING UP. WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. YOU AND ME. NO, NO, I TOLD YOU TO BACK OFF. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL. AND I'M TELLING YOU IT'S ALL BAD. CATHERINE, THE COPS, THEY'RE ONTO US-- ONTO THE TAPE! - WHERE IS IT? - I GOT IT, BABY. - OH, OKAY. - I GOT IT, COME ON. - WAIT, I CAN'T GO WITH YOU. - YOU CAN'T GO WITH HIM. TRUST ME ON THIS. NOW LET'S GO! NO! NO! - [ Angela yelling ] - HEY! LET GO OF ME! ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU HURT? I'M-- NO. SEAN HAS THE TAPE. HE MEANS TO BLACKMAIL ME WITH WHAT'S ON IT. WHICH IS? I THINK YOU KNOW. MY GOD! THE BRAKES DON'T WORK. HANG ON. [ tires screeching ] [ police radio chatter ] THE BRAKE LINES WERE CUT. LOOK-- I KNOW I CAN BE A JERK OFF, BUT YOU GOTTA TALK TO ME. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - SHE MAY NOT HAVE KILLED HER HUSBAND. - BASED ON WHAT? - A LOT OF THINGS. THINGS I CAN'T REALLY GO INTO NOW. BUT DE LUCA, I COULD REALLY DO WITH SEAN MALLOY'S ADDRESS. COULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME? I NEED A CAR AS WELL. THANKS. CARMINE, ABOUT THE GENARO THING-- I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. I KNOW THAT NOW. REALLY, THANKS. IT'S GONNA COST YOU 70 BUCKS TO GET YOUR WRECK OUT OF IMPOUND. AND DON'T MESS UP MY CAR! [ chanting ] MONEY TALKS, GARBAGE WALKS. THIS STRIKE MUST BE PUTTING YOU UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S STRANGE THAT WE FOUND THE TRASH CONTRACT ON LUKE CARTER'S BODY? HEY, I'M NOT THE ONE ON TRIAL HERE. - I COULD CHANGE THAT. - COME ON, THAT'S CRAP. IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO SEE THAT LUKE AND I WERE TRYING TO PUSH EACH OTHER OUT. - LUKE WAS A FUCKING SNAKE. - "MONGOOSE" EATS SNAKE. IF LUKE IS DEAD AND HIS WIFE IS CONVICTED, - THIS IS ALL YOURS. - ALL WHAT? THIS CRAP? SORRY. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BALANCE, MOE. WHO GETS IT? WHAT KIND OF BOGUS INVESTIGATION IS THIS? SINCE WHEN IS THE ACCUSED KILLER ALLOWED ON THE INVESTIGATION? I SHOULD FUCKING CALL THE MAYOR. YOU DO THAT. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER WHICH OF HER OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS SHE WANTS THE MONEY TRANSFERRED INTO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T WANT THE MAYOR. I COULDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HER, BUT I WANT PHIFER. I WANT HIS BANK NUMBERS. SORRY. CAN'T HELP YOU. Angela: YES, YOU CAN. THEY'RE TAPED TO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TOP DRAWER. QUITE A CELEBRITY LIST, MOE. I'LL ASK THE COPS TO PATROL THE BUILDING. SHOULD KEEP MALLOY AWAY. I NEED YOU TO STAY PUT UNTIL I GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU. OKAY? OKAY. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I'VE GOT TO DO. DID YOU MOVE THE FILES? JONAS HAS THEM. HE'S TAKING OVER THE CASE. WHY? HE THINKS YOU'RE TOO INVOLVED. TOO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH, MORE LIKE. THAT BASTARD! HE'S COVERING HIS TRACKS. HIS, THE MAYOR'S AND A DOZEN OTHER NOTABLES. WHAT DO YOU HAVE? ENOUGH TO BRING THEM ALL DOWN. DID YOU GET WHAT I ASKED FOR? YEAH, FULL CREDIT HISTORY. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT JONAS. HE'S GOT BANK DEPOSITS AND CREDIT TRANSFERS FROM OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS. - IT MATCHES. - YEAH. DID YOU SPEAK TO AL? NO, BUT HE DROPPED THIS OVER YESTERDAY. HE DID A DMV TRACE ON BLUE VEHICLES REGISTERED IN MARYLAND WITH PLATES THAT START WITH "O" OR "Q." 128 MATCHES. Taylor: BUT ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS. Missy: OH, SHIT. Taylor: JONAS? THIS IS YOUR CAR, ISN'T IT? YEAH. IT WAS SEEN OUTSIDE THE HOUSE THE NIGHT THAT LUKE CARTER GOT MURDERED. I HAD BUSINESS THERE, EARLIER THAT EVENING. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT BEFORE? WHOSE BUSINESS? THE MAYOR'S? YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE. YOU LYING, SELF-CENTERED, POMPOUS SON OF A BITCH. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? 9-7-8-6-7-4-0-2-9, BRITISH CAYMAN ISLANDS. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY THE RICO PROBE STALLED, ISN'T IT? YOU WERE FEEDING ME BLIND LEADS. THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED ME ON THIS. SO YOU COULD LEAD ME AROUND IN CIRCLES LIKE BEFORE. - WELL, DAMN YOU! - TAY, STOP! IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I WANT. THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, THE GAMBLING, THE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS. YOU ARE FINISHED. YOU DON'T HAVE THE BALLS. REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? SELL MY PERSONAL FILE TO THAT REPORTER AGAIN? [ sighs ] OH, NO, MISSY. NO, NOT YOU. CLIVE WAS GONNA BLOW OPEN WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GENARO CASE. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DISBARRED. I COULD HAVE! IT WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD DO TO KEEP HIM AT BAY. - GOD, I'M SO SORRY. - THIS PLACE IS JUST ONE BIG STINK-HOLE. - TAYLOR, LISTEN TO ME. - NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME. YOUR RUN IS OVER. I AM GOING TO ENSURE YOU NEVER RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. I AM GONNA CRUCIFY YOU. I AM GONNA HUMILIATE YOU AS A HUMAN BEING. Clive: TELL HER TO TELL THE SENATOR WE JUST NEED A SIMPLE STATEMENT. WE'RE GOING WITH THE STORY WHETHER SHE'S ON IT OR NOT. CLIVE, YOU WANT AN EXCLUSIVE? YOU, STAY AWAY FROM ME, OR I AM CALLING THE COPS. CALM DOWN, IT'S FOR REAL THIS TIME. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE GENARO CASE. EVIDENCE WAS SUPPRESSED. I KNEW IT. I APOLOGIZE, FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY OFFICE. WE WERE WRONG. IT'S ALL THERE. IT'S A TREASURE TROVE ON PHIFER, THE MAYOR, LUKE CARTER, BRIBERY, CORRUPTION, EXTORTION. YOU NAME IT. TAYLOR...? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? LET'S JUST SAY THIS TIME I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES. COME TO MY OFFICE. [ honks horn ] Sean: WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? DID YOU CUT THE BRAKES IN THE CAR? DID I OR DID I NOT TELL YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT CAR? [ dials cell phone, beeping ] [ rings ] DE LUCA, LEWIS. I'M AT MALLOY'S PLACE. CAN YOU COME OVER? - [ gun cocks ] - DROP THE PHONE, CHUMP. Taylor: AL, YOU OKAY? HE'S FINE, JUST KEEP WALKING. SURPRISE, SURPRISE. I SUPPOSE YOU CAME HERE FOR THE TAPE. - SHUT UP! - [ Taylor grunts ] SEAN! I'M PISSED OFF. KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH BECAUSE OF YOU? BIKER HEMORRHOIDS, I HOPE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SHOOT ME. NO. BUT I'LL DO HIM. OR WOULD THAT BE TOO HEARTBREAKING? YOU SLEPT WITH HIM, DIDN'T YOU? - YOU SON OF A BITCH! - [ Taylor grunts ] I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU, YOU BASTARD! NO, DON'T! GET AWAY, YOU WHORE! DOES LOVERBOY KNOW WHAT'S ON THE TAPE? I CAN MAKE A PRETTY GOOD GUESS. OH, REALLY? MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SO STUPID AFTER ALL. SHE PLANNED IT ALMOST PERFECT, YOU KNOW? COME ON, LET'S SHOW DON JUAN, SHALL WE? Asshole. [ gasps ] [ yelling ] [ Luke laughs ] I can't take buckwheats. I'll fuck everyone. Even you, my lovely bitch. Angela: Luke? Luke: Hi, Honey. [ Luke laughing ] Fuck you... and your insurance. Watch this. - [ shotgun blasts ] - [ Angela screams ] [ water splash ] Catherine: Oh my God! He's shot himself! We have to call the police. No, wait, let me think. What do you have to think about? He's dead! Please, hold on, Catherine. Let me think, okay? Angela: I need you to do something for me. Catherine: What? What? Okay! It can't look like a suicide. I'll tell you why later. - Will you help me? - Yes. Okay, I need you to go to the cellar, find the videotape, get the tape... don't have any prints left. - Can you do that? - Yes. INSURANCE DOESN'T PAY OUT ON SUICIDES. Sean: NO, IT DON'T, SHERLOCK. WHAT WE GOT HERE IS THE REAL SCORE. RIGHT, BABY? GIVE ME THE TAPE. SEAN. WHY? TO DESTROY IT. LATER, BABY, AFTER WE BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT AND GET OUT OF HERE. GO UP TO CANADA WHERE THE MONEY IS. Angela: NO. THEY WANT YOU TO BE GUILTY. IT'S OVER, SEAN. NO, IT AIN'T. NOT AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE. THAT BITCH, CATHERINE, SHE WAS GOING TO THE COPS. I TOOK CARE OF IT. I GOT THE TAPE BACK FOR US, BABY. YOU'RE SICK. - AND YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD! - [ Angela screaming ] SHIT. [ crashing ] [ car horn blaring ] [ gun fires ] OKAY, THANK YOU, MRS. CARTER. OKAY, GIVE ME THE SKINNY. SEAN MALLOY. YEAH, JEALOUS EX-BOYFRIEND, YADA YADA, IT ADDS UP, BUT IT DON'T. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? OH, PUT IT TOGETHER. HE HATED CARTER. MISSY WILL SHOW YOU THE DEATH THREATS HE WROTE. DEATH THREATS? LIEUTENANT! I THINK YOU'D BETTER TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. I'LL BE DAMNED. HE KILLED CATHERINE AS WELL. IS THIS FOR REAL, AL? YES, JUST LIKE THE BOSS SAID. OKAY, THEN. LET'S WRAP IT UP! SO WHAT NOW? YOU MIGHT SAY I'M GONNA TAKE A PERMANENT SABBATICAL. BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO EXPOSE THE BIGGEST CORRUPTION SCANDAL THIS CITY'S EVER SEEN. IT'S A PROSECUTOR'S DREAM. NAH. IT'S NOT FOR ME. I JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE TOGETHER WE COULD REALLY GIVE THEM A RUN. YOU'LL GIVE THEM THEIR DUE, MISSY. I KNOW THAT. I GUESS WE DO LIVE BY OUR MISTAKES. I GUESS. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, TAYLOR. YOU, TOO. YOU WANNA GET OUT OF HERE? YEAH. LET'S GO. De Luca: HEY, ONE MORE THING. EITHER OF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A TAPE? [ reporters yelling ] MR. PHIFER! MR. PHIFER! Clive: THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS CERTAIN CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN LESS THAN ETHICAL WITH THEIR CAMPAIGN FINANCING. - WOULD YOU CARE TO RESPOND? - CLIVE, AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED WITH POLITICAL ETHICS AND I'VE OUTLINED A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM PACKAGE THAT WOULD MAKE ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAMPAIGN FUNDING. MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN SILENT ON THIS ISSUE. HOW THEN WOULD YOU RESPOND TO DOCUMENTS SHOWING MORE THAN $600,000 TRANSITED FROM KNOWN MOB SOURCES TO YOUR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS? I'D CHECK MY SOURCES MORE CLOSELY. IS THIS CLOSE ENOUGH? HOW'S IT GONNA FEEL TO BE PROSECUTED BY YOUR OWN TEAM? [ reporters shouting ] STATE'S ATTORNEY JONAS PHIFER ON THE STEPS OF THE STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE... [ motorcycle engine revs ]
