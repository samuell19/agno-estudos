~DANTE'S INFERNO~ In presenting in screen from the more striking scenes of "Dante's Inferno" we are realizing a cherished ambition. After a long period of careful preparation and thought, we decided to interpret reverently this classic materpiece in its undisguised truth - weaving into its vivid realism the thred of a simple modern story. Thus the warning of Dante is more definitly emphasized that by our daily thoughts and acts we may be unconsciously building up for our future - A VERITABLE HELL ON EARTH. In the human brain a thin wall divides a heaven and a hell. Are we hewing down that wall? Are we leaving love and sunshine for the crimson realms of agony and remorse? Mortimer Judd, convinced that might makes right, has fought his way to wealth and power with pitiless determination. "Hosptal For Fururables My dear Mr. Judd. ~" Ernest Judd, his son. ~"Oh, would I were a bird!"~ "Oh, would that I had a gun!" Craig, his neighbor - forced to the brink of ruin by Judd's merciless business methods. "At tomorrow's meeting of creditors yours will be the deciding vote the can throw me into bankruptcy -" "Will you help me?" "I cut 'help' out of my vocabulary twenty years ago - and it has paid me pretty well." ~Dante's Purgatory and Paradse~ ~Inferno~ Miss Vernon, his mother's nurse. Mrs. Judd - and Dr. Josephs her attending physician. "Did you prescribe this nonsense, Dr. Josephs?" "I bought that radio for mother - because she isn't able to go out for entertainment." "You are overworking, Mortimer -" "Don't worry - only the wives of rich men can afford to be ill." And close upon this messenger comes a delegaiton from Judd's Poole Street tenements. "Your son can tell you - your tenements ain't safe to live in!" "Get out!" "How dare you question my good judgment?" "Because your judgment is not always good." "Doctor, I wish you would speak to Mortimer. He's not realy cruel - it is overwork." [Dante's Inferno: End of Part One.] [Dante's Inferno: Part Two.] "Mortimer, I want a word with you." "No use looking for business here, doctor! "Listen - if your brain was as sound as mine, you'd have ten million dollars in the bank, same as I have." "I have warned you, dudd!" In the midway of this our mortal life. I found me in a gloomy wood, astray. Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell. How first I entered it, I scare can say Such sleepy dulness in that instant weighed My senses down, when the true path I left. Dante Beatrice. "Immortal spirit of the poet Virgil, attend me! "I who have commanded thee to appear - from among the dead - am Beatrice. "The poet Dante from his path hath stray'd - be thou his guide, as destiny shall decree." "Have mercy on me, spirit or living man! Whate'er thou be!" "Thy soul is by vile fear assailed, which oft so overcasts a man that he recoils from noblest resolution. "Fear not, Dante! I thy guide, shall lead thee hence through an eternal space - where foot of mortal man never yet halt trod. "From here ou course leads downward to a city of woe - where souls lost forever eternal pain endure. There is a place within the depths of hell call'd Malebolge, all of a rock dark-stained with hue ferrugineous, e'en as the sleep that round it circling winds. "We are beside the woeful tide of Acheron, the curs'd strand that every mortal must pass who fears not God. "Live spirit, aho there standeth, get thee hence and leave these who are dead." "Him death not yet halt o'ertaken, nor sin conducts to torment - "- but 'tis ordained that I who am dead, must through the depths of hell, from circle to circle conduct him!" "Woe to you, wicked spirits! Hope not ever to see the sky again. "I come to take you into eternal darkness, there to dwell in everlasting torment." "Now let us to the blind earth there beneath descend, where thou shalt see the souls of sinners to misery doom'd. "Thus the despairing shrieks of tormented souls invoke a second death. Now by a secret pathway we proceed Between the walls, that hem the regon roun And the tormented souls: my master first, I close behind his steps. "Such a long train of spirits - one should ne'er have thought that death so many had despoiled." "Those who die subject to the wrath of God, all here together come from every clime. "Yonder sits Minos. That Judge severe of sins dooms each soul to a place in hell to suit the transgression. For when before him comes the ill- fated soul, it all confesses." "Who is this, that without death first felt passes through the regions of the dead?" "Hinder not his way he is by destiny appointed!" "Outcasts of heaven whence this wild excess of insolence? "Away, foul demons, and let them pass!" "The vain and conceited are punished here. "See how the demons of hell with restless fury drive the spirits on, without hope of rest to solace them. "Here heaven's stern justice lays chastising hand on the liars, flatterers and deceitful. "Eternal fire that inward burns, show them with ruddy flame illumed - as in the nether hell thou seest. "Fix thine eyes on the river of blood in which all are steep'd who have by violence offended. "Plunderers, robbers and murderers who inflict violent death and painful wounds upon others, are here tormented. "They with their hands alone strike not, but with the head, the breast, the feet, cuttings each other piecemeal with their fangs. Thus we from bridge to bridge, with other talk, The which my drama cares not to rehearse, Pass'd on; and to the summit reaching, stood To view another gap. "The heretics are entombed here, accompanied by every sect - their followers. "Much more than thou seest the tombs are freighted and are different in degrees of heat. "Take heed, Dante, lest thy curiosity lead thee beyond my guidance. "Faint and overcome with toil, behold the proud in humiliation bent. "Yonder lies Cleopatra, lustful queen. "Away, corruptor, here women are none for sale! "Demon, get thee gone!" So hollow is the depth, that from no part Save on the summit of the rocky span, Could I distinguish aught. Thus far we came. "It is time to dress for dinner, sir." "Daddy, won't you please come to dinner?" "So - you think I am avaricious, do you?" "If you could see some of the suffering and misery down in our tenements, you'd understand, father." "Can't help it - your father's orders are - Put 'em out!" "- and my little girl is down with a fever!" "Now listen, Ernest - I'm only carrying out your father's orders." "So there you are - you call me avaricious - I call you prodigal. "I make the money and hold on to it, while you throw it away. "Ernest, if I listened to such sob stuff, we would all be in the poorhouse." "Miss Craig to see you, sir." "Mr. Judd, I have come to plead for my father. "If anything happens to daddy, you shall answer for it." "Miss Vernon, you were engaged to nurse my wife, not my son." "And now, Dante, let us continue our journey through hell." Not am I came where many a 'plaining voice Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came Where light was silent all. "The prodigal and avaricious are here forever in eternal conflict engaged. "Why holdest thou so fast?" "Why castest thou away?" "Not all the gold that is beneath the moon, or ever hath been, might purchase rest for one of these toiled, worn souls. "Comes the hail of fire, which, like a torment, rains vengeance down upon them. "Oh, the anguish of that race who lie beneath the pelting bolts of fire! [Dante's Inferno] [Part Four.] "There in the depth behold the fraudulent and deceitful. "Of all malicious acts abhorred in heaven are fraud and deceit. Therefore such sinners are doomed to endure severer pang. "No power can them absolve after they in the boiling pitch are thrown. We entered on a forest, where no track Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light The boughs and tapering, but with knares deformed And matted thick: "Thus the suicide must forever remain rooted here. "If thou would'st be further convinced - pluck thou a twig." "Why pluckest thou me?" "Woe is me, for having sinned through suicide." "Mortimer Judd - I am the curse sent by Craig to torment you." "Get out of this house before I kill you! "You can get out too!" "Won't you please come over ~ I'm afraid something terrible has happened to my father." "My death is upon your soul, Mortimer Judd ~ because you had no mercy in your heart." "Go to his house ~ perhaps you can save him ~ and perhaps you will be too late!" "No, no ~ ! won't be too late! I will save him I tell you ~ ! will save him!" "Look! Look! There he hangs!" "Come away, my child~ this is no place for you to ~" "You have killed him, just as though you had plunged a knife into his heart!" [Dante's Inferno] [End of Part Four.] [Dante's Inferno] [Part Five.] "Oh daddy, daddy ~ why did you ~ " "Demons, take your victim away!" "See how they leave his mortal body ~ while his immortal spirit is carried away." "And so begins your curse! Too late ~ always too late!" In the shadow ~ "Too late! Too late! ~ again too late." "You told my mother to go ~ well, she's going!" "The police! Escape while there's time ~ hide in the cellar, of your tenements!" "The tenements! Too late ~ again too late!" "There's old man Judd, the owner of that fire-trap!" "Only today we begged you to give us fire protection ~ now look!" "Come on, folks ~ let's throw him in ~ see how he likes his own medicine!" "This criminal is a fugitive from justice! THE LAW WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM." "Cease thy wailing, Mortimer Judd ~ thy wealth avails thee naught before my throne. "Take him away to the pit of molten wealth ~ wherein he may gratify his desire for money power which ne'er enough could satisfy him. "Away, foul demons ~ thou ~ who ~ which ~ they ~ us ~" "Craig, your curse shall become a blessing! "Like Dante, I found myself in a gloomy wood astray, gone from the path direct. "You are the Virgil who led me to the light." "I'm de only one roun' heah dat knows what dis is all about' "But ~ you tell it!" Our acts our angels are, or good or ill Our fatal shadows that walk by us still. [Dante's Inferno] [THE END] Nisan 2023 Arnavutköy Subtitle file: by Atilla Sade
