[MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: --due to shrinking enrollments in sections 4 and 5. Moving along, I would like to congratulate Dick McCarthy on his very thought provoking article on the image of heat lightning as used in "The Scarlet Letter." Wake up, Bob! MAN: Dick's article reminded me of work I did at Hopkins-- that was during the Stone Age, of course-- on images of hail and freezing rain in "King Lear." I remember the article. Oh god, I'm going to throw up. Mr. Fine, uh, do you have something to say? I said I was going to go up to the library and-- and find that article. MAN: An excellent idea, Mr. fine. I'm sure you'll enjoy the library. To conclude, we had hoped to open two more tenured positions, but only one will be possible. Both Mr. Fine and Mr. McCarthy have been with us for four years, and both are qualified for tenure. I don't take bribes Oh, certainly not. What should I gain by the exaction of this forfeiture? A pound of man's flesh taken from a man who is not so estimable, profitable neither, as what, Mr. Fine? As the flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say to buy this favor, I extend this friendship. MAN: Bravo, Mr. Fine. Bravo. How the hell did you know that quote? Oh, my father's in the dress business. I always liked "The Merchant of Venice."

Then we could proceed directly to the chilled grapefruit. I think that's a great idea, sir. Have you heard from Bob Fine? Yes. Plane landed 10 minutes ago, and they're on their way. Hard to believe, isn't it, sir? Ah, marvelous day for all of us having a giant like Sir Alec here at Chipenangle. So I stood at the window nude holing myself. You know. Well, I-- I don't think I do. And I said, civilization and its discontents-- rubbish. And so that's how a great poem was written. Amazing. Same car. Oh, why don't we whip this guy already, huh? Well, I'd say the cafeteria staff has done an absolutely marvelous job. Splendid, sir. [HONKING] Has to be students. Oh god! Must be upper classman, I would think. BOBBY: Come on, Sir Alec!

The most famous poet in the world. The most famous, and I was chosen to drive him. Well, he must like you up there at the college, eh? They did. They thought I had a lot of potential until those two goons came along and dragged me out of there. Now they have no idea where I am. Well, call up and tell them. Tell them what? That I got kidnapped by gangsters? Bobby, we-- we had a year you won't believe. I mean, Eddie took over. Who-- who is this Eddie? Don't ask. And what's he expect me to do? Join the business? Doesn't he comprehend the fact that I know absolutely nothing, nothing, about dresses? I told him! I told him that very thing. And that I have a career of my own? Did you tell him that? And that I'm up for tenure? Bobby, Bobby, you don't understand. He'll-- he'll kill me. Yeah, what? Kill you in a business sense? [SHEESH] You mean those-- those guys? They'd actually kill you? Physically kill you? They'll kill me then go out for pizza. They don't give a shit! You're taking my breath away. Dad, I had no idea things were so bad. Oh, Bobby, you know me. I never wanted to burden you with my crap. And, well-- eh, this is bad. You got a lot of tension in your neck. Tension? Heh, I want to hang myself. No, wait a minute. Let me think. I can tell him that there's a family emergency. Then we have the Christmas recess, then this intercession. I could put four or five weeks together. You think there'd be enough? Oh, Bobby, you're a fabulous kid. Yeah, well, I just don't want you hurt. And who knows? Maybe it'll be an interesting experience. You look fabulous. Thanks, Jeffrey, you look great. Did you see Steven's window at Saks? Nothing but fags here. Come on, Dad. I'm not prejudiced. It is just an observation. Look at this shit, huh? Is that him? JACK: Yeah, that's him. BOBBY: Who's the woman? She's very attractive. JACK: That's his wife. That's his wife? You're kidding. Bet you don't see things like this up in that college, eh? Hey, you are gorgeous-o, you know that? Unique-o, really especiali-da! Leave me alone, imbecile, imbecile. Woo, the lady speaks! I can respect that! Hey, just for my curiosity here, where'd you pick up tiny, Ringling Brothers? Eddie? Eddie, darling. That-- uh, that's a gift from my mother. He's an animal. You could say that. Ready to talk to him? He's just a big jealous pussycat. What do I say? Small talk-- how much you're looking forward to be the business. You know-- blah, blah, blah, blah. But don't be a putz. Don't start with the "Canterbury Tales" or whatever. This guy don't know shit-- guns and throwing. I'm scared out of my mind. Good. Eddie! Ha ha. Jack. Oh, this is my son Bobby. Bobby, this is Mr. Eddie and his wife Lira. Jack Fine, makes dresses. Ah. [SNAP] Drinks. Hello. Hello. Are you really Eddie's wife? LIRA: Si. And you are a professor, yeah? Uh Eddie? Bobby-- Bobby's just dying to get into the business. Sit down. Oh, very sweet of you. Bobby? Bobby? Eddie asked us to join him. I noticed that you had a little, uh, fracas here. I'm having shark. You want some? No, no, you misunderstand. I-- I didn't say fricasse. I said fracas here. You know, like an argument. Fucking-- what are you doing? getting into semantics with Mr. Eddie? Eddie, that's a-- that's a beautiful suit you got on there. Yeah, Christ Velour. Oh, I know it's Christ Velour. I mean, that's my line, Christ Velour. Isn't that beautiful, Bobby? The suit? It's great. LIRA: He pick it out himself. Hey, you speak very good English, huh? She dance good. We noticed. You too, Eddie. Hey, hey, you're some dancer. Yeah, where'd you learn that disco? Heh. You know, I-- I could never do that. Yeah, my-- my son maybe. Maybe my son Bobby could do it. No, I-- I don't, uh, dance. No? Dance? Yeah, yeah. Listen, you two have a lot of fun because Bobby and I have to go. Got a big day tomorrow. Got to introduce him to the business. Yeah. You do good, huh? Ah! Thanks for the encouragement. Eddie, uh, we'll-- we'll talk, huh? [ROMANTIC MUSIC] I fuck around. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [HONKING] JACK: Some of you may remember when he used to come here as a little snot-nosed kid. But now he's come here to-- I got some beautiful cotton her.e Not now, Sam. Bye, everybody. But now he's come here to help his old man out in a time of need, so to speak. My son Bobby Fine. Thanks, Dad, and-- and thanks to all of you for welcoming me here today. As you probably already know, I'm pretty much of a greenhorn in this business. My primary interests have been in the field of American literature-- Hawthorne and Melville and some of the transcendental writings. Bobby-- Nevertheless, I'm going to do everything I can to help my dad and Fine Fashions get back on its feet. I'm going to go amongst you today and absorb and learn, much in the tradition of Shakespeare's "Henry V," the royal captain of this ruined band walk from to watch, from tent to tent, that every wretch, pining and pale before, beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks. Do you believe this putz? Can I try? [MUSIC PLAYING] SINGER: (SINGING) Look for the union label when you were-- Adjustable sleeve, orange and burgundy. Why don't you give us a hand, Bob? This is you, ladies. SINGER: Our union sew it. Our wages going to feed the kids and run the house we work on. But who's complaining? Thanks to the ILG, we're paying our way, so always look for the union label. It says we're able to make it in the USA. No, gracias. Well, I think he's cute. He's a schmuck. I feel bad for Jack. I'm sure he wishes I were his son. Ah. So? So I think I did pretty well today, all things considered. Yeah, the salesmen hate your guts. Why? JACK: They think you're a snob. That's absurd. JACK: You got to be one of them, Bobby. You got to be a mensch. Talk about what they want to talk about-- going to the races, get laid. Dad! Dave said you didn't even play the football pool. I don't follow football! Well, that's not the point, Bobby. Everybody plays a football pool around here. It's a way of life. I'll play the pool. What else? Well, you're a klutz. That I can't help. JACK: Just make an effort. That's all I ask, huh? OK, OK. What time are you coming home? Eh, 9:00, 9:30. I got some phone calls to make, a few hours to go over. Look, why don't you go to the movies? Relax. here. I got money. This isn't that goddamn cow town of yours, you know. Dad, I grew up here. Well, it's changed. I'll manage. I'll see you later. Be careful on the subway now. Jack! Come on. Let's get a cab. LIRA: Mr Fine! Bobby Fine! Buona sera. How are you? [CLEARS THROAT] Well, I had an interesting first day. Quite a business. I don't know if your husband ever talks about it. Daddy. Get in? Yes, get him. We have a dinner, caro. Where is your husband? Oh, my husband. Come. I don't-- Curtains. Leno, a casa. Si, senora, a casa. A casa, that-- that means home, doesn't it? Yes, si. Well, speaking for myself, I'd be a lot more comfortable, uh, in a-- in a restaurant somewhere? Maybe out of town? Does that come with the car? Amazing. It will relax you, caro. BOBBY: At the risk of seeming overly cautious, where is the approximate location of your husband? Oh, my husband. He's always working, caro. Sometimes, he comes home at midnight, sometime 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, and sometimes never. Well, he's a hard worker. Oh, he's an idiot, caro. How do you say? Sicko-- sickopath? Psychopath. Psychopath. You, professore, you are a man. Well, I'd like to think so. Come in. Buona sera. Ciao, Silvia. So do you like my home? BOBBY: It's extraordinary! It's all right? Oh, yes. She's my friend since before Eddie. Caro. Sylvia-- Eh. Buona notte. Was very nice to meet you. [PINBALL SOUNDS] Extra game. Ha! [MUSIC PLAYING] Does this decor reflect your taste or Eddies? So hot here. I'm a very unhappy woman. You are? You-- you and Eddie seems so happy together. Oh, it's a masquerade. I wanted to sing opera, caro. But one day, my father, he came to me with a long face. And he say that I have to marry a tall American. You mean it was an arranged marriage. Yes, and so I got off the plane from Rome. And there he was, like the King Kong, huh? BOBBY: He's a very large man. Very large, yes. Not a man. Not a man? Eddie? No. You-- you mean that he's-- he's homosexual? No, no, it's not homosexual. it's-- it's not-- al dente. Do you understand? No. It's overcooked, soft, mole. I don't think I understand. Oh caro, the linguine just hang there, eh? You mean he has a problem with impotence. No, he don't have any problem. He doesn't care. I have a problem, caro. Well, you shouldn't have such problems. So help me, professore. Help me. [PINBALL SOUNDS] Tilt? BOBBY: You're sure he never comes home? No, no. Oh, what beautiful legs-- like a normal man! Well, we have a swimming pool at school, and often, not every day-- Oh, professore. Average class has about 20 students. Professore. [CRASH] Tilt? LIRA: It's him! Ecco! I knew it. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Sylvia! Sylvia! Sylvia! Go, bye! Darling. Buona sera. Hungry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you, Sylvia. Doesn't he wear any pants? Sleepy peepee. Caro, why don't you stay here? We listen to some music. Darling, darling, darling, come. We watch TV in the den, eh? Peepee. [CLEARS THROAT] BOBBY: Here, I'm in the north side of the bed. Oh, you all right, professore? It's awfully drafty down there. When can I leave? [GARGLING] Wait. Eddie's a deep sleeper. My father's worrying about me. I think I'd better be going. [WATER POURING] Go, go, go, back. Darling. Oh, my sexy man, the nice shirt, huh? EDDIE: Damn Sylvia. Oh, poor Sylvia. She works so hard. [SIRENS] Buy choo-choo stock. My big bambino. Hey, I got a splitting headache. [BARKING] Caro. It's OK. Jesus, it's 5 o'clock! Come. What? To my bed, caro, like a man. In your bed? Yes. Come, you must finish. Are you crazy? If you don't, I'll scream. You'd scream? I'll scream! Come. No! Beautiful boy! Professore. Oh, forget him. Oh-- Don't be shy. Stay here. Oh! I thought you said he was impotent. Huh? You-- you said-- Ah! --he was impotent! No! Ah! Oh. And now, professore, be a man. BOBBY: I can't go out dressed like this! LIRA: Hurry, hurry, hurry. You look so nice. You must go. Presto, presto, presto, presto. I can hardly breathe in these things. Ciao, professore. Was beautiful. Go! Oh, oh! Yeah? Money, money! Wait.

Fine Fashions, you're the boss. What are you giving in like that for? Sell her a little bit. She likes that. You're worried about Bobby? SECRETARY: Raymond to shipping. Come on. He's probably with a broad. It's not like me. He-- he would have called. I ever see you at the baths? Try my house again, Laverne. You need a Valium. What I need is an enema. Jack, today, I got some beautiful plastic. What the hell am I going to do with plastic, Sam? For Christ sake's get lost, eh? Bye, everybody! Plastics. Nobody answers. Christ. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, it's locked! We keep it locked. That's the law. That's an odd law, isn't it? Keeping a fire door locked? There's laws against walking around bare-assed too. Excuse me. You're Jack Fine's boy, right? Listen, I got-- I got to apologize. Oh, that's OK. I know you met a lot of new people yesterday. I'm Dick Letterhouse of Polite Fashion. - No, I mean-- - --Paul. --the pants, the pants. They're sensational! Unbelievable! Since when is your dad selling jeans? Absolutely unbelievable.

I'll take 10,000 right now. 10,000 of these? I'll take 20,000. You believe I was just standing here and this kid walks by like nothing's new? Your father's a tricky old bastard, I'll tell you. Well, if you'll-- if you'll just follow me-- Can these also be worn with shoes? Oh, sure. This is just one particular style I'm wearing. Oh. This is fantastic. I heard it died in Fort Worth. Look, you don't like my goods, get the hell out of here, eh? Jack! Oh, who needs this goddamn aggravation? Oh, you're behind the times, Jack. You're outre. Outre, my ass. Hey, come on! This ain't my floor. --Jack Fine for years. [INTERPOSING VOICES] What the hell is this, now? Holding out on us, Jack. JACK: Bobby! What a stretch. It really works! What are you doing in the slippers? We've got a real phenomenon going here, dad. Oh? The men's jean is still in the works-- What? Well, actually, this is the ladies jean that I'm modeling right here. All right. MAN: You rascal, Jack-- sending the kid down to the lobby wearing these. You knew we'd go nuts, right? Well, I mean, you've got to be outre, eh? You don't want to be ultra outre. I know you're all anxious to get your orders in. So if you'll just sit down and make yourselves comfortable, Rick and Dave will be anxious to take your house. Jack, Jack, you're giving me 20,000. Oh, no problem! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Listen, sit down, and I'll bring you guys some Asian coffee. [INTERPOSING VOICES] What the hell is going on? We'll find out. Talk to Sy.

Well, it's-- it's quite remarkable. I was in the lobby-- frantic, actually. What do you mean? You came dressed like that? Well, I had no choice. Jack. Oh my god. - Turn around. - What happened? Oh, must I? Did you get mugged? In a nice way. All right, I want a sketch of this in a half an hour. With-- with a see-through behind? I want to sell a half a million by 5 o'clock. Now get me a sketch. Go ahead! So you showed up dressed like this? With slippers and ripped pants? Dad, I really had quite a night. Oh, I bet you did, eh? Who was she? Some buyer? Eddie's wife, Lira. Eddie's wife? I couldn't call. I was hiding under their bed all night. Hiding? From Eddie. He came home just as we were about to get seriously involved. I found myself fleeing down their hallway like some character in a farce by Moliere. Moliere. I stayed crouched under their bed freezing in my underwear all night. Finally, Eddie went to sleep. And then Lara asked me to share their bed. We made love. You banged her with Eddie there? Well, he woke up, but she pistol whipped him. He went right out. Oh. Oh, Bobby, you got to be shitting me, Bobby. She's a remarkable gal, dad. Heh. Laverne, bring in some Maalox, eh? Their marriage isn't what it appears. Who gives a shit, their marriage? What are you, a social worker? That Eddie'll rip your head off. Eddie will never find out. Yeah, well, well, you got to get out of the country-- Europe or South Amer-- or Israel. Yeah, you got a cousin there. Jeez. Oh, dad, you're being so negative. This is gonna save the business. We'll be in great shape! Jesus Christ, it's like a Bible story. I got to save a dress business by killing my son. Look, dad, I can take care of myself. Eddie's wife? Jeez! Was she good at least? Even with Eddie there. Eh? Heh heh. I always loved Italians. Jack? You sent for me? Sam! Ha ha ha, come on in! You know my suicidal son Bobby. It's an honor to meet you. You know how long your father and I go back? A long time, I'll bet. We go back a long time. He's always been beautiful to me. Even what he's hostile, he has a lot of warmth. Sit down, Sam. How's maxi? She dropped dead. Don't you remember? You were at the. Funeral Oh, yeah. I-- I-- I'm a little nuts today. But you got married again, right? That's right. How is she, your second wife? Passed away also. Oh. was-- was I at the funeral? No, you were in Puerto Rico. But you sent fruit. You've had quite a run of bad luck, Mr. Schlotzman. I consider myself a fortunate man. I found myself a third wonderful wife. Oh. Heh heh heh. How is she? Little under the weather? Well, I'm-- I'm sure she'll be all right. I mean, the odds, huh? Sure. Sam, listen. You said you had some plastic. How much? 250,000 yards-- just came in from Germany. Soft, gorgeous. We'll take it all. 250,000 yards? Jack, you got something hot? Bobby, stand up. A revolutionary new look in jeans. Jack, you can see his ass. Well, that's the point, Sam!

The main thing is you're making an effort. You look so fabulous. Look at that, Italian clothes, contact lenses. I'm so proud of you. Yeah. You sure you won't reconsider? Oh, dad, I can't. I got a commitment to that college. I've got students doing independent study. Besides, there are other reasons. Oh. [PHONE RINGING] She still calling? Two or three times a day. Last night, her car was out in front. I had to go out the freight entrance. I mean, I like her, and I really think she's gorgeous. But No, no. You got to stay the hell away from her. Besides, we're paying Eddie back on Friday. No kidding! Yeah, and it's all ours again thanks to you. Come on. BOBBY: It's been a unique and wonderful experience for me having worked with you all-- the very fiber, the very backbone of Fine Fashions-- the fabulous Rick and Dave, the incomparable Sophie, a very volatile Angel and Raymond in shipping, a remarkable cutter, Gus Trichonopolis, the wonderful Hy and Sy, our brilliant bookkeeper Irving Katsman, and of course, my totally unbelievable father, the great Jack Fine. Aw. It's an honor for me to call you, as Shakespeare's "Henry V" put so aptly, we few, we happy few, we band of brothers. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] What a guy! What a guy! Who is this whale? Gee. Oh, it's her. Man are all the same! Pig! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] because I'm a crazy woman! I don't want to see you anymore. Stupido, stupido, professore. What do you think, I'm nothing but a puttana? What? You take the advantage of me, and then we never spoke to me again. I take advantage of you? Are you nuts? You dragged me into bed. I drag you into bed? I came from the best Italian family. I'm a lady. Do you know that? I'm a lady! Of course you are. Please. My father's asleep upstairs. Why don't you answer the phone when I call you? Because I was afraid to take those calls because you're married to a gorilla, for Christ's sake. Dear professore, do you like me? Yes or not? I've never met anyone remotely like you. So-- So the hell with Eddie. I'll take my chances. LIRA: [SINGING IN ITALIAN] Boy, I used to fuck like that. SINGERS: (SINGING) Now is the month of May when merry lads are playing.

Sportsman's collection. Hey, they have stuff quality. Quality but at a price. Course, if you've made a fortune in see through jeans, you don't care about price. Ah. Mind if we join you? Would you guys quick breaking my chops already? Fine. We want to hear all about it. How come you came back? What do you mean how come I came back? I work here. Couldn't have dragged me back. All those girls, Fine. The So Fine girls? Must have made out like a bandit, huh? Well, there was one amazing person. One of those girls with her ass showing? Oh my-- Ah! Can't take it. An Italian-- unbelievable woman. Her passion, her completely unbridled lust. Oh God almighty. Ask her out, Fine. The spring mixer's coming up. It's not the kind of woman you bring to a spring mixer. No? No. Rome, yes-- to Florence, to Venice, but not Chippenango. Anyhow, she's married. Really? Fine! You surprise me! I surprise myself. Is her husband the jealous sort? Sort of. Darling. Darling. Do you like it? Oh. Fine. He's late. Maybe it's a bad traffic. A million and a half bucks. So much money. What's the good if we don't go anywhere? Darling, this year, we take a trip. Si? Yeah, Vegas. No, I want to go to Rome, to Venice, to Paris. No more Vegas. Vegas, then Reno. You don't like it, tough shit. Chippenango campus shoes. Fine! Ooh, cold. [MUSIC PLAYING] What's up, boss? Get out. Want us to come with you? No, alone! Eddie? Eddie? Eddie, It's me, Jack Fine. Eddie? Fall over a stiff, I know it. Buongiorno. Oh, buongiorno. Yeah, I-- well, the door was open and nobody answered. Ah, no one is here. I am Sylvia, the au pair girl. Well, Sylvia? Ah. Sylvia, yeah, that's-- that's a nice name. Listen, is everything all right? I mean, I'm Jack Fine. I was supposed to meet Eddie.

It hit him in his fat head. Holy shit! Oh, your son is a beautiful lover to Lira. Well, naturally, but I mean, Eddie's wife! Why does he have to-- Now Eddie knows beyond any doubt that your son make beautiful love to Lira. Ah, it's out of our hands now, Senor Fine. It's a matter of honor. Oh, no, no, not now. Not now not now. Later, huh? - Oh-- My heart wouldn't be in it. Later. No, I got to run. No. Oh, Signore! Signore! Oh, a real man! [BARKING] MAN: don't exactly know where the campus is. it's in-- it's in town! EDDIE: Where's that? MAN: Wait, wait, look. I explained this to you about 20 times already. What are you, some kind of ding-aling or something? Oh, get with it! Oh, Mister. Mister, take it easy. I'm sorry. Oh, I mean, I had a long night and everything. [BARKING] [YELPING] Next time, you'll be courteous. Want coffee, Professor Fine? All right. I have to stay awake for the hour for the opera tonight.

Yes, I came for you. Can I get you something, ma'am? Yes, do you have rooms here? Excuse me? Lira? Rooms! We need a room, caro. This is a house of pancakes, ma'am! Maybe you'd like some pancakes. Pancake? For dinner? We have blueberry, which the professor had, Dutch apple, strawberry. He knows, caro. Oh Christ, no. Eddie? Yes. He knows that you fill me with love. [ORCHESTRA TUNING] And you're-- you're sure you don't know where he is. Caro, just run. You don't suppose he could find his way up here. In the morning, you and I go to Venice, eh? Venice?
