Why not? The cops don't provide gambling and whoring. That's illegal. Law is defined by people. Homosexuality used to be Illegal and look what happens now. Illegal or not, People will always gamble and whore. What do i do? I'm a...cop. Can't you cope with it? Brother Tung! - Brother Tung. - How was it, Brother Tung? Don't worry about it. Brother Tung. Pushy-Pin, give me 10,000 bucks. You lost again? Quit now and come back tomorrow. What the hell are you reading? 'How Lee Kar-Shing Became A Millionaire' Who'll become a millionaire by reading this shit? I'm only looking at it. - Whatever, how about the 10,000? - No. - Don't play games with me. - Who's playing, Brother Tung? So what are you going to do? Shit! Don't touch me on the shoulder, just give me the money. The bosses are here, what could l do? Right, Big Brother! Whatever he says goes. It's not the end Of the month but take this. What will i do with a few hundred bucks? I've got that myself. - Then why ask for more? - That was 10,000. Here's a few hundred, go and win the lottery. Lottery my arse. Hey, let me be the dealer.

Don't worry, I know my left from my right. Do you think we can trust him? He doesn't look right. I don't know what people they're giving me. We'll stay alert. I'm getting out. That's Tung's car. - Has someone sold us out? - Tell the guy to hold it. We'll page him but he might not get it as we're offthe mainland. - Why did you page me? - Give me $200 and I?ll tell you. I won't give you shit. Talk. - Are you giving me anything? - Tell me first. That place over there's working the ecstasy. The bosses are meeting today. Chief told me to keep an eye on them. Watch? That doesn't mean we have to do anything. - We'll watch. - What about my money? - Later. Go buy me a cup of tea. - Later? - Tea? You can have my piss! - You've not paid your rent yet! Whatever stock you've got, I'll take it all. It's not how much we've got, but how much you can move. Whatever stuff I've got, l can push. Custard Tai, Big Brother can all go and eat shit. OK, then. Deal. - We're partners, then. - Whatever you say. It's only for the money. - What are you looking at? - Go. Hey! Hey! What's going on? You bastard! You... Don't run off! Come here. Stepping on my car... - What do we do? - Left, not right! What a fuck-up. Where are you going? Police! What are you doing? Say it was a traffic accident. I hired the guy. The guy's dead. Before he died he said that... Big Brother hired him to kill someone. The guy's dead. Go. Get lost! This is between the two of us. It's none of your business. Go! I'll shoot her. I'll shoot her! I'll kill her. This is the Bravery Award. It was ten years ago. Though l seem well-mannered, l started off as a constable. - You've received one, haven't you? - Three times. Michael Cheung, transferred from SDU. For the time being, you'll head C Team. I've read your record. - Your nickname's The Killer King? - It's a joke. You killed four criminaIs? And you just hit your superior? Don't think of me as your superior, treat me as a friend. This is the file on your team. Ask Tung if you need help. Treat him like a boss. You told the cops that l threw garbage on the streets so watch out. He said watch out? It doesn't mean he threatened you. That's not true! He told my dog to watch out as well. Excuse me, do you know where Tung is? Tung? He's helping out on Team B's operation tonight. If you can't find him, try Jak-Ban tonight. - What's Jak-Ban? - A nightclub. - Cops going to a nightclub? - Why not? What are you doing? Why have you got a recorder on? It's off. You were just chatting so l turned it off. - You're recording our conversation? - Not all of it. Hello, Mum. l've got to flee. What? Flee, not flea! It means run away. Yeah. With Big Brother. Who eIse? The big one! Yeah! How should l know? Who am l going to ask?! Stop nagging me! l know, l know. No, no danger. It's OK, just pretend I'm going on a trip. I'll call you when l get there, bye. Where's my bikini? Big Brother, you can't take all the cash. l have to do the books. I'll transfer the money back to you tomorrow. - That's no good. - Here! Do the lottery for me tomorrow. Aren't you ready yet? They won't wait for us! - Is she here yet? - No. Typical woman! Even late when we're on the run. Why did she buy a mobile if it's always off? They're supposed to be convenient. - Big Brother. - What? Aren't you ready yet? We won't make it! OK, we won't wait. We'll just be late. She's crazy. Why don't you call Brother Tai now? If you forget later, I'm in trouble. I'll call him when l get there. Come on. Bring another woman. We might get bored later. - Are you bringing one? - Of course. - Dirty sod! - Why not? - Isn't it gorgeous? - It's a new colour. Of course! What are you doing? Why the bags, are you going somewhere? - I'm running away. - Sounds exciting! - Do you want to come? - Really? - We're going now. - Let me get a bag. There's no time. - What do we do on the run? - Nothing. Just doing you. Where's the bloody lift? Excuse me, is Tung here? Brother Tung? Not this early. Do you want to wait for him? - Thanks. - This way. - He really has gone. - Big Brother! Listen to me, he has really gone. You're just playing games. l wouldn't lie to you. He's run away with Suzi. You're joking! No one'd go anywhere with Suzi. No, listen to me. He even took all the money from the drawer. Is she OK? She's fine. It happens all the time. l haven't seen you before. Is this your first time? Don't go yet. I'll reserve a good table for you and a beautiful escort. Bobby, look after our customer. You're here so early. My name is Yoyo, Mamma Yoyo. Ask for me, OK? Late? He used to wait over an hour for me. Asshole! One, two, three, four, five... - Six. - Go Mamma Yoyo! l bet you can't beat me or my Mamma. - I'll take you on tonight. - Really? - Forget about me, just beat him! - Yeah! - Have fun. - More drinks? Mamma, can l have some cigarettes? Good girl. Dice, please. Are you bored? Just sitting there, not talking. Are you OK? It's my first time here. You must come more often. If you feel down, just come for a chat. Why do you have a handbag and they don't? It's to carry the girIs' cigarettes. The more cigarettes l give out, the more girIs are being taken out. You're very professional. Thank you. Have a drink. Is that Coke? - It's heaIthy. - Whatever. Cheers! Cheers. I really enjoy talking to you. Why did you tell him l came here a lot? I'll have to bring him now. How are you? - We had to tell him something. - You didn't have to tell him that. We might get a free meal. - Hi, Officer Cheung? I'm Chan Tung. - The missing Tung? People who respect me call me Devil Tung, if not I'm just Tung! - Bobby. - Brother Tung. Why did you put Officer Cheung here and not in the VIP room? Forgive me. I'll do it now. Little honey bee, flying from flower to flower. Flying, flying. Flying, flying. Flying, flying... Drink! Drink! You said you'd drink. She's drinking for me because she's really thirsty. Little honey bee, flying from flower to flower. Flying... Flying. - What? - You know where can l rent a place? Why do you want to rent? Just pick up a girl and go back to her place. Flying... Wait. l have a big apartment with a nice bedroom. Page me about it. Remember to page me! You got my number? - Is it expensive here? - It's free. Well, there's a discount. They have something called the... public relations fee, just help yourself. Hey, girIs. Would you all go out? Big Brother's run away with Suzi. He took all the money, too. What do l do now? l was only a bit late and he didn't wait. Don't worry. Officer Cheung will track him down for you. Don't worry. Oh, yeah... Don't take all my girIs. I've got a business to run. Tell me who you like and I'll reserve her for you, OK? Officer Cheung, you pick one. l don't need to. You have to, this is your first time here. It's a rule. - Go on, pick one. - You. - Officer what? - Officer Cheung. I'll go grab my bag. Wait for me. Hey, you left something. Don't mess about, the guy's my colleague. OK. He'll get the shit when Big Brother comes back. Running away so happily with Suzi. Now, I'm happy. Shut up! Why don't you put in a new light bulb? - Where? - There. - Cos nobody visits me. - If you've got a bulb, I'll do it. My man didn't do it, why should you bother? This one's dead, too. Just leave it. I?ll fix it. Just the light in the room's OK. No need to turn the whole building off. Are we going to a hotel? You still have to pay either way. What kind of attitude's that? Since you said that, we'll go. Don't drink so much. You'll give yourself an ulcer. Why can't we drink? So you want to do it? Come on. OK. - What are you doing? - Three years ago l charged 3,000. To celebrate my comeback, I'll charge the same rate. No price increase! Wait. The money's not important. - What? - The money's not important. But l don't want to do it. Why not? Even you don't want me. What's wrong with me? l don't... l don't like to do it with an unhappy woman. I?m unhappy? How do you know I?m unhappy? l am not unhappy. Don't cry. You really don't want to do it? But a part of you is reacting. No it's not! You keep crying, it's OK. - How was last night? - Nothing special. - Nothing special? - What about you? Just like you, nothing special. 8,000 dollars for all this space. It's a bargain. It looks a bit run-down. It?s not run-down, it's designer. - Hey! - Why have you brought a guy? Do l need your opinion now? Are you afraid he's a pervert? In school all you perverts took a shower together anyway. That's why I?m afraid. You don't know what he'll do. What the hell? This is our new boss, Officer Cheung. Sam. Help yourself to whatever. I'll charge you each month. How come you've got a fridge like this? It used to be in a corner shop. These are from a game centre. And the turtle is from a turtle restaurant. They're all things from different periods in my past and full of memories. Junk! Throw it away. Putting them in my room all the time. l don't care who you are, give back my bra! - They just got up. - That bra's mine! - Who is this woman? - l don't know her, either. Do you remember who l am, then? - Have you had your fun yet? - Stop messing about. What do you do? Who do you like better? The one who remembers my name! Don't argue! What? Amazing! A one-night two-stand! Where's my room? It?s next to his. - Is it going to be noisy? - No. - No, it won't be. - It'd better not be. This way. A big, sunny room. Warm in winter and cool in summer. It?s great. Is someone living here? Yeah. Me. - $8,000 to live with you? - I?m not included! This dump costs $16,000? I?m paying eight for the storeroom! - You can't work it out! - Get off me. It includes water, electricity, land rent and whatnot. - That's what l pay. - Where will you sleep? - In the living room. - Keep to your word! l don't care, l can sleep anywhere. We're on the same team, interaction's the important thing. 8,000 is a good price, a bargain... We've talked and decided you're out of the picture. l hate those goddamn cops! - Don't worry. - Don't you worry. - Are you up to 36B yet? - No, I?m only 35. l have to tell you that l take discipline very seriously. My jurisdiction or my house will not be allowed to be in a mess. Do you understand? Do you understand? Where's the toilet? The new boss? Why did you bring him here? Where's the new boss? - Getting a car from the station. - Getting a car? What the hell! Why does he want a car? - How should l know? - I?m asking you! - l don't have to answer to you! - Why the car? Wow! Don't tell me this is it! Wow! Is this it? Move it! Move it! - Sorry I?m late. - Are you going into battle? Wow! Is this your car? I found out that our team has a really low crime-solving rate. Our crime-solving rate may be low, but we're here to prevent crime. I?m the boss here. - I feel good! - Why are you laughing? - I?m just laughing. - Want a smack? Granny, this is for you. You can be my lucky charm. A cop is still human. A cop works for the money too, right? We can't be responsible for everything. Both cops and criminaIs make a living with guns. The only difference is... that the criminaIs don't get a monthly paycheque. The cops just have more stability. Don't ask why l became a cop. Don't ask why l play video games and don't work. I?m bored! lf l knew, I'd be a scientist. Do you know why you are you? There you go. Go and play. Stay there, show me your lD? Come on, hurry up. Where are the other two? Nobody knows where they are. But they're doing something. They left a message? Maybe they really are doing something. They haven't been home in four days. The landlady's after rent. Soon even l won't go home. All you can do is laugh. Look at this! You call these noodles? It?s not my fauIt. l only bought them, l didn't make them. - The boss has been looking for us. - Really? l didn't know. I?ve not checked my messages. l told them we were very busy. - Yeah! - It?s so annoying. - We have to go back after these. - Why? It?s payday. - So what? - We've got to show up for it. - It?s only payday. - We have to go. - We'll go, then. - You're annoying me. Look at these. Hand them over, I'll have them. l became a cop because if l hadn't, I wouldn't know what eIse to do. In this world, in between the black and the white, there's a grey area. Some people have a large grey area, some a small area. As for me, there's only a line between the black and white. You could say that I?m traditional. In fact, I am. Hey! Where have you been? Playing hide and seek? I?m being obedient. You said raise our solving rate, so l am. - Are you messing about? - No, I?m serious. Look! Here's my lead. Time to work. Hi, Brother Tung. What's up? What are next week's lottery numbers? - l wish l knew. - You don't know? - Do you know now? - l really don't know! One more kick should do it! What's wrong? l don't know! One more kick will do it. Louder! l don't know! Help. Help. Are they filming here? Robbery! Robbery! - Robbery! Help! - l owe you one. Robbery! Cops! You thieving little bastards. - Don't move... Shut up. - Take it easy. - Calm down! Calm down! - Shut up! - Calm down! - Open the door! Open the door! Shut up you bitch! I?ll count to three. Let him go. I?ll kill him! Hold on. - Let him go. - Keep quiet! Keep quiet! Bastard! It hurts! It really hurts! It hurts! You're touchy. Didn't you trust me? I?ll get closer next time. Love Horoscopes? What does it say? My stars, yeah, yeah. Wait a minute. I saw the lights on so l came up. I thought you were in Macau, I didn't know you were back. I've brought that thing with me. Did you find out for me? Did you miss me? I'd better sign it now before l forget. It'd better be signed before it expires! All right. How come you're out here? Who's that? - How are you? - Fine. Go and put some trousers on! She can see everything. What were you looking at? Look at me! Look! - What's up? - What are you looking at? - I?m only looking. - Well, don't. Hey, what about me? Hang on. - What? - Here's some money. - Why? - To rent your room. - Use the sofa. - Don't give me a hard time, please. - How long will you be? - I?ll be real quick. Thanks. Are you going out to pick up guys? Give it a rest. You're not the only one out there. The money will always be there. You still have me. How are your shares doing? I?m looking for a tall building. - You've done well? - No, to jump off. So you're broke, then? I?m always broke. Why eIse would l rent out my own room? - Are you going to lend me some cash? - No! I?m going. When are you coming back? I?ll do some food. I?ll call you. Finished? Finished! I?m even smoking a cigarette. Where's the girl? Kicked her out. After I've finished, what eIse? Have you changed the sheets? Why would l change the sheets? Tell me why l have to change the sheets? - What's going on? - Time to get up. - What time is it? - One. It?s time! For what? To get to know the neighbourhood. This is the best time. Are you coming or not? lf not, I?ll go by myself. Hurry! Wait! - Can l smoke a cigar? - Go ahead. A cigar! Cool! Give me one. Thanks. See how your gun's sticking out? Everyone will know you're a cop. How can l show you around looking like that? You teach me what l should do. - Come on, put it inside. - In there? Yeah, just put it inside. It?s safe. My car's safe. Who's got the guts to touch my stuff? Don't think so much! Put it in. - Hi, Brother Tung. - Thanks. My pleasure. - Brother! Pushy-Pin's on the line. - Right. You go in first. Hey, jerk! Why aren't you here yet? What are you doing? - What's up? - I?m a cop. So? We're full. Go away. - Brother Tung! - You messing around, fat boy? - This is my friend. - OK. No problem. Go right in. Aren't they afraid of cops? Do you think cops are all-powerful? This world changes after midnight. Identity no longer counts, influence does. What kind of influence have you got? Enough for them to call me Brother Tung. You wanted to see the area, this place is an example. You get all the dregs of life coming in here. So, where are they, then? It?s still early! Let's get a drink first. Early! It?s two in the morning. Why do they come so late? They all come here after work. You lose face If you don't bring enough people. Over there, each table represents a gang. And each table represents a separate business. Like Monopoly. Like Monopoly? Why is nobody sitting at that table? It belongs to Big Brother. He's on the run. So nobody dares to sit there. - Brother Tung! - Hey! - You didn't have to! - l must! Brother Mike, my boss. - Hi. Brother Mike. - All right. I won't disturb you. I?ll be over there. OK. It?s Chinese stuff. It revitalises your body. It?s good for your throat. Have one. It'll do you good to take one. I?m giving you that, so how about you give me a cigar? We're starting to become friends! Four, ten. Open, ten. - Is anything wrong? - Nothing. Sit down. - What's up? - Are you messing about? So what if we are? You're outnumbered. You've got room. Big Brother's on the run anyway. Let's play paper, scissors, stone. - Do i know you? - Brother Tung! - Do i know you? - You don't need to. i know you. Sit down so you can play comfortably. Move! There's nothing happening. Go. Thanks. No problem. l have to look after you. I have to look after you till Big Brother comes back. Till Big Brother comes back. - What's up? - This place isn't for you. - Why? - Do you want to get beaten up? Leave quickly. What did you just give me? What was it? Chinese vitamins. It?s really revitalising! Don't go! - Ten, open. - Ten, five. Is this a midnight snack or breakfast? What's the difference? Officer Cheung! Didn't you go with Mamma last night? When is it my turn? Come on, come with me! - Mamma is really pretty. - Of course. They're ignoring us. Go on! Just go. What were they doing? They were hitting on you. You're so popular, the whole family's after you. Mamma likes you and the girIs fancy you. My bad luck to have met you! So, what the hell am l doing here? - Wow! How did you know l was here? - l could smell this! If he can't find anything to eat, he shows up. Not eat last night? Who said l didn't eat? First time was OK. I tried for seconds but she wouldn't let me. You really are something! It?s not only you! He may be a skeleton but he's a babe-magnet. If he doesn't get it, he donates his sperm. What? The massage-girl l just did was fucking Man-Dik the night before. She said that he wanted Big Brother's turf. l already know that. He's very good at getting information from all the girIs. Did you wear a condom? How do you know she's clean? Let's eat. Help yourselves. It?s just beginning. It?s six thirty. Let's go to a club. What? You still want to go to a disco? Don't tell me you've never heard of morning discos? Scary! Come on! Custard tart. Eat it while it's hot. Word is that since Big Brother went, everything's changed and the boys can feel it. Of course you can feel it. Look at everyone. You need money to eat and drink and you are all sitting here! It can't go on like this. What do you want me to do? I?m worried too. I left all that to Big Brother. Do you want me to get a steak knife and stab Man-Dik? I don't even have a steak knife. How am l going to sort it out? Look at you all. Moaning about the smallest thing. In my heyday, l was tough. Man-Dik is crazy. There are rumours that he's tied in with some big names and now we're being left out. l don't care. Whoever settles this thing will get promoted. All l need is my custard tarts and to get my dues every month. Not to baby-sit these boys. - Brother Tai, my boys are tough. - Shut it. Who are you to speak? I?m Pushy-Pin Wah. Pushy-Pin Wah, I?m a fair man. Those with strength lead. That's how Big Brother started. Yes. - Uncle, good morning. - Morning. - What's the news? - Local or international? Economics? Just tell me what the analysts say about the stock market. Think about your next move, interest rates could rise. But you can't trust these analysts anyway. Some papers say the complete opposite. Thanks. Isn?t he great? Knows everything in the world! This is my boss, Officer Cheung. - Hey! That's a Chinese name. - My dad was Chinese. He brought honour to his country! Since the stocks collapsed, l don't read papers. I?d rather chat with Uncle. l read the papers so l have something to bulIshit about. People like me know everything about the world but don't join in it. He means don't ask him for information. Brother Tung always understands me. l have some hot stuff, want to see? Yeah, let me see. - That's amazing! - Good, isn't it? It?s good, yeah, but it's expensive. - Cheek! Looking and not buying. - It?s expensive. Brother Tai, finished your custard tart? - Hey Tung, watch the boys for me. - Sure, no problem. Uncle, how come that car didn't get a ticket? You don't even know Brother Tai? He watches over nearly all the neighbourhood. Who'd dare give him a ticket? Didn't you say you weren't going to ask questions? Officer Cheung, don't be too tough when working around here. Those who were tough are no longer cops. Thanks, Uncle. All the new bosses want to act tough. Let's see what happens. - Yes? - Tea with milk. Who was that just then? Who did Uncle say it was? Whoever he said it was, it was. Do you know him well? Just an acquaintance. Thanks. This place isn't for you. You belong in a classy area. Big Brother's gone. Tai's men can't guard their places. Bobby, I?m taking over this one. Talk to Brother Tai. lf Big Brother comes back, there'll be problems. Still scaring me with his name? We all know he's on the run. lf he comes back, he'll go to jail. Calm down, Brother Man-Dik. Have a cigarette. We can talk about things. Man-Dik! Don't move! You want to die? You're going die. I?m going ask you, who looks after this patch? - You do, Brother Wah. - Yeah, l do. - You were part of this too, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Lee Chak Sam? - That's me. - Is it really you? - Aren't you Gi Yun? - I?m Lam Yu Yun! - Whatever. Same thing. - We've not met since graduation. - What's your number? What's wrong with you? Have you got crabs? It'll be OK. It?s not a long treatment. Just keep clean! - l have been clean. - Try to be cleaner, then. - Move. - Where are we going? - Just keeping the area clean. - OK. - I've not washed my hair yet. - Move it! Boss. Recently, in your life, in every sense, l mean, or financially, have you had any problems? My life is good. l don't have any problems. Do you? No, l don't have any problems either. But, really... do you really feel that you don't have any problems? It?s not really a problem. Just a small question. l don't know if l should do it or not. The most important thing is to be true to yourself. It?s OK to be unfaithful with others. Do you understand? The most important thing is yourself. It?s OK to be selfish. No one will know. Of course! - Thanks. - It?s OK. Wait! Do you have enough money? Money's not a problem. Flowers are cheap. Have you checked properly? No one's paged me? - Shit! - What are you doing? Nothing. - Who sent all those flowers? - They're for you. - Me? - Yeah. Who is Mike? You don't know him. Leave them by the door. - What's this? - Nothing, just some hardcore stuff. When did l say l wanted X-rated stuff? Take it back or I?ll get arrested. If you don't sell them, how will you pay us 4,000 a month? 4,000! I've been paying you guys 1 ,500. You can't increase it like that! Brother Wah's orders. How else will we get rich? Just to help you, sell one and you get four per cent. - What's this? - Someone will pick it up later. - Hey! - Don't ''hey''. Brother Wah's orders. - Thanks. - I've got something to say. What? Let's talk inside. No. My place is in a real mess. - Do you want me to say it now? - Yeah. What is it? l really like you. l fell for you when l first saw you with Big Brother. But he was my big brother. Is he not your big brother now? He's not coming back. No matter what, you'll always be my younger brother. Please, don't. I?m not the kind of guy you think l am. Hi what? Hi this. Come in. Why didn't you look for me at the club? For you. Nobody gives light bulbs as presents! - Did you change that bulb? - Yeah. l can change them from now on, ifyou like. What? What's with everyone today? - Do you know who my boyfriend was? - Yeah. So what's the problem? I?m a whore. For $1 ,500 we can talk. Nobody here seems to want to talk. You're crazy. You're right, l am crazy. You have to be careful, they call me The Killer King. Good! I?ll see how you die! - Don't kiss me on the mouth. - Just once, come on. - No, not on the mouth. - You're not a princess! I don't do that. OK, OK, we won't kiss. - Hey! Condom. - God! You scared me to death! You don't have any? The damn boss must have stolen them all. Don't worry, it'll be OK. - No! Go and buy some. - But l've got an erection. We're only doing it once, It'll be safe. No! We have strong principles. Look at me! I?m not sure if l can keep it up if l have to go out. I know! Sam! Go and ask Sam! Go. - Can you lend me a condom? - Condom? l never use them. You're dirty! Don't use my bath from now on. What! Go down and get me half a dozen. - Only half a dozen. - Hurry up. Hang on. Here. Use this for now. You can do it twice in that. Hurry up! You're not going to use six In an hour anyway. What? Hasn't Sam got any? Sometimes l think there's a barrier between us. A plastic one. Sometimes there's even two. You're not a whore, so why can't we kiss on the mouth? You don't trust me. You think I?m a whore-merchant. You're scared l've got AlDS. You treat me like I?m a gigolo. I don't want to do it. If you don't want to do it, it doesn't matter. Is it possible not to do it, just spend the night here? Don't you have to go back? It?s overnight?

Some things don't need saying, they're obvious. You were just my shoulder to cry on but we'll be good friends, OK? No, it's not OK! I?m going. But i love you. Ovaltine again?

Fight! Don't run! I?m going to kill you, motherfucker! You fucker! Wait for me. Stab him! Cut him! Fuck your mother! Cut him. Don't you run. I?m going to chop you, you motherfucker. I?ll chop you.

You shot me and now you hit. - Son-of-a-bitch. - Shut up. Don't move. Don't you dare. Sam, call an ambulance. Call an ambulance! Did you see what l did? You see me? I chopped him right there! You see his legs all over the place? It was so cool! You should have seen me! Damn you! It if wasn't for you I would have done that cop. Yeah, it was your fault. This is the main news. A newspaper vendor was seriously injured in an assault last night... In the main office. Brother Tung! Are you OK? I was worried. Sam, charge those two guys. Smoking? Do you think this is a restaurant? l brought these two here. How dare you have a go at Brother Tung. Don't be so cocky. You can't shit on me cos Big Brother's not here. Don't forget that l watched you grow up, kid. Brother Tung, this is hard for me. Your boss is causing me trouble. l can't let a cop do that to me. Are you admitting it? If you are, I?ll charge you. What will you charge me with? Working together with you? Yeah, do it officially and you'll be in jail longer than me. Bye, Brother Tung. I?m in a hurry. - Take care of yourselves. - Yeah. I?m going. It there's a good citizen award, l think l qualify for it. What's your relationship with Pushy-Pin? What relationship? I watched him grow up. I don't mean that. I don't like talking in riddles. If you've got proof, show me. Don't try to frame me. Were you bribed? - If you have proof, put me in jail. - You're a cop, not a gangster. Who is calling Miss Lam? No name. Tell her l transferred money into her account. I?ll inform Miss Lam. Mamma Yoyo! Do you know who's back? Laura, back from Atlantic City. No, it's Suzi! Please let me come back to work here! Why did you come back? Did Big Brother come back? - Yeah. - Why did you come back together? We came back, we just did. You said you'd send me money. You said you'd take care of the club. I've never had to rob people to get money before, Brother Tai. Yeah, Brother Tai wasn't good to you. But l had my own problems. If you've come back to take it out on me, do it. But brother, l don't make the rules in this world. Nowadays, whoever makes the money rules. l heard about all the things Pushy-Pin's done. I?ll end it. Pushy-Pin can be taken care of later. - But Yoyo... - What about Yoyo? Whatever your relationship with Tung is, he shouldn't let his white boss seduce your woman. Men are sensitive about these things. A woman being taken away from you is different to being dumped. How do you think others will see this? Times have changed, some people may see it differently. I?ll call you later. He just came to see me. l told him to take care of his woman first. You watch yourself. Sam, tell the officers that Big Brother has come back. Keep an eye on Pushy-Pin and his boys. lf anything happens, page me immediately. That's it. You bastard! - Don't! - Get lost. - l can't let it go. - Don't! - Don't move! - You won't shoot me. Don't! They already have a baby. Tell him! We're having a Punk-Punk. Shoot me! Shoot me! Sorry. I?ll be responsible for bringing him back. Trust me. I?m all right. Don't be scared. The scariest part has passed. This is between Pushy-Pin and me, it's nobody else's concern. I don't want everybody to see two brothers arguing. Keep an eye on the rest of the gang, don't let them in. - Yes, Big Brother. - That's it, you can go. We're going now. See you later, Brother Tung. Let me. Even ifyou're left with nothing, you'll still have me as a friend. - Check. - Don't be like this. We haven't been to a massage parlour for a long time. Let's go. I?ll get the check. I've been in the Triads for such a long time. Got myself to Big Brother and I've still only got a few streets. It?s not worth all the risk just to be a face. When any of you cops come by, l still have to stand and get searched. You could have been a cop yourself, but that was your own fault. In the past a cop could take money. Now, he has to take care. When we handed over a criminal to you, the cop was worshipped. Now you have Internal Affairs and you have to be clean, we can't help you out any more. Being in the Triads is a joke now. What's the point of it? Come on, some people still follow the brotherhood code. I followed the code and look at where l am. Losing my brothers and my woman. Did Pushy-Pin try to...? Hey? Why ask? Just leave it. Don't look for more trouble. Me and Yoyo thought Of the name Punk-Punk. I feel bad enough about someone taking my woman, but my own brother. What should l do? We're all brothers. Really, you... You're a cop. Leave the underworld to sort out its own problems. Pushy-Pin is a lot different now. Pushy-Pin was raised by me, I?ll deal with him. After that, I go with you to a lawyer. What? Trust me, I?ll sort it out. You're so bad, squeezing my nose! Go on, let me. It?s good stuff. Try it. - Big Brother. - Big Brother. Big Brother. Big Brother. Big Brother. - How have you been? - And you? - How's life with Big Brother? - Good. If you hadn't called me Big Brother... I?d have stabbed you! Tell me, when did you start to follow me? I?ll tell you, 1986. You told me your big brother wasn't good to you - you wanted to join me. You said that you hadn't got any responsibility, so i gave you a street... to look after. I even bought you your first pen. Who is the big brother? Do you want me to call you Big Brother? Then you said that there was more in a disco, so i opened up a disco for you. So what now? Have you lost your mind? Today i came here to have it out with you. Have you got the guts to tell me I?m not your Big Brother? I?m waiting. Big Brother. Big Brother. You'll always be my big brother. It doesn't matter who the big brother is. I?m a big brother, you're a big brother. I've been promoted, how can l step back down? Are you following me now? Say it. Say it! Big Brother. Why did you come back? - Take care of him. - Yeah. - Don't! - Don't be shy! Send everyone to track down Pushy-Pin. No matter what, you must find him. Page me immediately ifyou find him. - What? - He's at the casino. I know! Want to gamble? I can risk it, can you? Do you know what you're doing? What can you do, Officer? Little bird fell into the water... Little bird fell into the water... Stay there. Pushy-Pin! Pushy-Pin Wah! I've come to find you, Pushy-Pin Wah. Pushy-Pin Wah! Pushy...Pin...Wah! l've come to find you, Pushy-Pin Wah! Pushy...Pin...Wah. Police! Police! - Police. - Come on then, if you dare. We're not letting you in. Help! That's my son. Don't make me. Brother Tung... l don't want it to be like this. Big Brother, you know what he's like. He wanted to kill me. But l killed him first! lf l hadn't, he'd have killed me. l didn't want to be Big Brother. l don't want it. Sorry, Brother Tung. Officer, be careful. They're all inside. Hey! Open the door! Open the door! You lost. Told you you couldn't do it. Tung's inside. - Tung! - Open the door. Very stupid! l use this. That's for Big Brother. Don't move. Tung! Call an ambulance! You bastard, why didn't you wait for me? Don't die, you bastard. l still owe you three months' rent. Get up! Get up, bastard! Good morning, Brother Tai. Tea with milk and a custard tart. There's no custard tarts today. l bought them all. Tung. Starting from today, don't call me Tung, call me Officer. Brother Tai, there's one left. I saved it especially for you. Tung, you're a clever... You're going to be promoted! We're off. There's no more custard tarts! This is my area now, not yours. See how many custard tarts l've got! - There! - Wow! Never! Here. Why are you being so disgusting? I?m squealing like a beaten pig! ..my future husband, next month. This time I?m going to be a real mamma. A baby's mamma! Don't be silly, of course I?ll carry on. How else will we eat? I don't want to talk. I was really touched when this man put some money into my account. It can never work with those kind of people, you know? I told him that. Talk about what, women? Can't l look? Living alone is great. You're stupid! What are you looking at? Show me your lD. What's your number?
