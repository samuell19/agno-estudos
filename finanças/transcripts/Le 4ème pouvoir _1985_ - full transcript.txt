ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY BY YONNICK FLOT AND SERGE LEROY Not the stuff on Lyon. Cut that. Call me the print shop. Good morning, Mr. Villechaise. What are you waiting for, come in. What do you have to present to me for my paper that is not stupid? - Politics, politics? - Yes, but it's solid. Yes, but political. Attention, for the document on Jordan, you copy it on tape recorder 2. Okay, on 2. Here we go. And the US President's proposal has been well received in European capitals, but in Moscow, we doubt that he? "Doubt?" No, that's not right at all. No. Cut that. Remove "that"? We doubt the sincerity of his intentions from our correspondent in Moscow, Paul Ballard? There is a hostage situation at a lawyer's house, should I send Renaud? No? No. Not Renaud, send Bertrand and ask for a direct for the 20 hours. Okay. What am I holding today, then? Could you get me a glass of water? It's a good time to take hostages, we had nothing? Now we have something. Jean? get me the mic interview. Okay? Now the mic, Catherine. Now the weather. - Good evening. - Great, everything is fine. - January six, can you hear me? - Copy that. Send two cars, four men, one at the Monceau-Messine intersection near Avenue Foch, the other at Messine-Haussmann near St Lazare. Roger, I'm transmitting. - Good evening. - Good evening, Catherine. To get three horses, take Tierc? Magazine. Don't forget the subject about Guinea. On the air in 20 seconds. In the kitchen, Chief. "Xavier Mar?che, the break-in specialist, escaped the day before yesterday from Fleury-M?rogis?" Good evening. "Police forces are currently surrounding the Parc Monceau area in Paris. Xavier Mar?che, the break-in specialist, escaped the day before yesterday from Fleury-M?rogis, where he was serving a life sentence. He took his lawyer, Mireille Santini, hostage. It was Santini's young son who managed to sound the alarm. On site, our special correspondent Bertrand Alain." Bertrand? Bertrand? Can you hear me, Bertrand? Yes, Catherine. Here, Mar?che is still holding Ms. Santini hostage, his secretary and a third person whose identity is still unknown. Mar?che demanded a car and the street to be cleared to allow its departure. And here is the car, with two inspectors on board. They're stopping in front of the door of the building. The inspectors get out with the doors open. They're taking their positions. Now we wait for Mar?che. Nobody shoot, let them pass! Here comes Mar?che. He's pushing his hostage towards the car. He is armed. Mar?che and his hostage are getting into another car they had the key for. We still don't know the hostage. Presumably a client of Ms. Santini's. No Bertrand, the hostage taken by Mar?che is not an unknown. Our colleague, the reporter Yves Dorget, from Paris Matin. Mom! They're stealing your car! - Do you know how to use this phone? - Yes. - Then call the cops. - And tell them what? If they continue to follow us, I'll shoot you. - Who are you calling? - The newspaper. They'll pass it on. - Paris Matin, good evening. - Give me the shorthand secretaries. Hello Jeannine, it's Dorget. Give the message to Villechaise. "Mar?che threatened to shoot me if the police continue to follow us." Pass it on, quick, right? I'll see you tomorrow night at 8 pm, good evening. Great. We're going to the conference now, we're not waiting. - Keep me informed about Dorget. - Are you sure that it's Dorget? I wouldn't have said it if I wasn't sure. I think they're letting us go. Perhaps, yes. - What are you doing? - And your article? Don't you want it? Yes. Paris Matin, good evening. Give me the shorthand secretaries. Hello? It's Dorget. No, no. Everything's fine, don't worry. So, are you there? "Mar?che's gun is pointed at me, but Mar?che will not shoot. I am not afraid of him because this man is not a killer. Unless, of course?" No, take that out, it's not good. "But he could be if pushed to the limit, because this man has nothing left to lose except what he calls his honor." No, not "his horror", "his honor"! With an "n", like Napoleon! Calm down, baby. Can you hear me? All right. "Except his honor that the jurors of the Amiens Court have taken from him by convicting him of a violent crime he did not commit." So now, Laura, what's the latest on the weather? Well, it seems that the cold front coming from the north extends as far as the center of France. We have morning frost in Brittany? Okay, thank you, goodbye everyone, so tomorrow, conference? At 1 pm, is that okay? - Yeah. - He was good tonight. - He was weird. - Good evening, everyone. Evening. - See ya. - Good evening. Can I get the final lighting stuff? I won't be in tomorrow morning. So take everything that happens on the oil tanker story and get the minister at the beginning of the newspaper. - Okay? - Okay. What about the dog topic? No. No, no, I don't want it. But anyway, I'll be there at noon. Let's hurry, Catherine, they're waiting for us. No, I'm not going, I canceled, I'm tired. - I should have warned you, maybe. - You could have, yes. But you go ahead, everyone will be there. - There'll be? - We'll see, I'll bring you back first. You don't look so good. - Do you have a fever? - No. What can I do? Find an open pharmacy. Journalist Yves Dorget is driving under the threat of Xavier Mar?che, who took him hostage. Our colleague used the phone in the stolen car to dictate an article that will be published tomorrow in his paper. - Can't you disengage for ten minutes? - No! And finally, the weather. In the southwest, lightning. Dorget is a friend of mine. PHARMACY Did you see? It's Catherine Carr?, there. - Here you go. - Thank you. Excuse me, Miss Carr?, please, could you give me an autograph? Yes. - Here you go. Thank you. - Thank you very much. Goodbye. This job is impossible. These people are killing me. We'll redo the front page with a 4-column photo. But no, not Santini, we don't care about Ms. Santini! Yeah, the kid coming out of the building, on page 3, frame it like that. - What's the title? - How long can we hold out? For the title? 23 hours. In Paris, we can change until 2 am, but only in Paris. Yes. And what will we look like tomorrow morning if Mar?che shoots Dorget at 3:00? Huh? Dorget is my friend. Dorget is part of the newspaper. Anyway, we have to find a title. So. The title. "Mar?che told me?" And below that: "Yves Dorget's last words." That's it. Last! That's what counts, last. With last words, we're all set. We're covered! You agree? Agreed. As soon as you see a nice car, stop. - Which brand? - I don't care, as long as it's fast. Thank you. MARECHE TOLD ME YVES DORGET'S LAST WORDS - Hey, Renard? You got a second? - Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. - What make is the car? - I didn't get a good look. Foreign, in any case. The color? Oh? Dark, maybe. Yes, dark. - The numbers?? - Oh? I'll stop. - Where was it? - In Blainville. Good. It's not much. Too bad you gave in. If he had taken another car, we would have had him. - Goodbye, gentlemen. - Chief, may I take you home? No need, thank you. - I don't like this guy. - Apparently, the feeling is mutual. You know I haven't recovered? - Recovered from what? - From your nighttime stroll. But I was scared to death, man! You still haven't lost your cool, hats off to you for the title, eh! "Yves Dorget's last words", good. - Is it true? - Oh yes. - We sold well, I hope? - Yes, all the radio stations picked us up. So you continue with your papers, naturally, and if you're good tonight, we'll make a killing. No, Andr?, I'm not going to go on TV. Listen Yves, be serious, eh? Yes, pass it to me. I mean, it's unexpected publicity, you can't do that. - Which TV, first of all? - Catherine Carr?. Yes, well, she was the first to call me. Hey. We made 35,000 on Paris Surface. So? Catherine Carr?. She remembers us, all of a sudden. Yes, thank you. I know. It bugs you. Go ahead! Come on. To you, old friend. Your old accomplice sees you coming, imagine that. These lights hurt my eyes. Sorry, I bumped you. I'm sorry, but we're running late. There's no rush, it's only 7:45. Yes, but we're busy tonight, everyone has to go to makeup. - I don't need makeup. - It's mandatory for technicals. I don't give a damn about the technicals! Enter. - I said no! - I told you, it's mandatory! - What's going on? - Mr. Dorget refuses to be made up. Is this true, Mr. Dorget? That's right. I refuse. And why do you want to be ugly? I'm not a clown. A little anti-shine powder won't take but a second. Just powder, okay? - Just a little. - Right. - You've changed your hair. - A little, yes. I knew a lady who changed her hair every time she changed lovers. I once knew a man who hated beards. They didn't know what they were missing. This is my veil. It's good, it looks good on you. Be careful later, don't talk too fast, don't wave your hands? Don't say hello to your granddaughter or your friends from the 14th? - Good morning, Miss Carr?. - Mr. Minister. Yves Dorget. Minister. Congratulations, sir, you have displayed exemplary courage in this matter. Quite remarkable. B?raut, president of the network. - See you on the set, Minister. - Fine. - Where are we seating the prime minister? - Here, Mr. President. - Over there. - Thank you. I put my sad face in your hands, Miss. Camera Three, close-up on Catherine. One on the minister. Two, stay on Catherine. - Who is the minister? - The government spokesperson. - I'm writing all this down? - Yes, Catherine wants it done. - Is there an "s" in "words"? - I don't know, man! We're on the air in 20 seconds. - Hey, don't forget about my insert, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Thank you. - ? and our guest of honor Alain Roger. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. ?with our great adventure film, but first, Info 20 with Catherine Carr?. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Three headlines in this newspaper, the elections in Mexico, the Mar?che case, and the sale of two nuclear power plants by France. Thank you, Minister, for being with us tonight. Two nuclear power plants is a very big contract for France. Yes, it is. It's a very big contract. Which should be valued not only in dollars, since the dollar is the international unit of exchange, alas, but also in hours of work, in jobs, in prestige for our engineers and technicians. Yes, but this contract was handled by the government of a general president who is known to be undermined by the internal rebellion. So it begs the question: will this contract go through? Of course it will. It has nothing to do with the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. Is it to ensure the future of the contract that France sends arms to the FLNRS? That is, to the rebels. France never supplied arms to the FLNRS. I solemnly affirm this. According to a rumor that was echoed by a weekly newspaper, it is said that there was a meeting between an emissary of our government and the leader of the rebellion, Halim Djavaoui. People say many things, Ms. Carr?. I am sorry that you too obey such a detestable habit. I have no idea what you are suggesting. I'm not suggesting anything, Minister. I'm asking you a question. Was there any official contact between France and the FLNRS? It's a yes or no question. My answer is no. Three times, no. Is that clear? That's very clear, Minister. And I thank you. Thank you. The Mar?che case. Mar?che, the gangster on the run, is still at large. "Police forces are now canvassing the Normandy region where it seems that he has found refuge after stealing a car in front of his hostage, our colleague from Paris Matin, Yves Dorget. Yves Dorget is with us tonight on Info 20." - Good evening. - Good evening. How does it feel to spend three hours at gunpoint? Well? Let's just say I've been in more comfortable situations. Were you scared? Fear? No. No, not really. No. Mar?che has never committed a violent crime. - That's not the opinion of the court. - No, but it's mine. Mar?che stole, but he didn't kill. Weren't you scared? - How was I? - Very good, convincing. It was time to stop this ridiculous rumor. I'm glad I could help you. The harm that irresponsible press can do? Don't you think success has gone to Catherine Carr?'s head? You've got to keep her in line. But I am. The elections in Mexico did not bring the change the opposition had hoped for. The government keeps its majority? Catherine would like you to wait for her. No, I can't. I don't have time. Thank you. - But she? - I don't have time! HALIM DJAVAOUI ASSASSINATED THE BODY OF THE FLNRS LEADER HALIM DJAVAOUI WAS FOUND RIDDLED WITH SIX BULLETS IN AN APARTMENT IN PARIS. It seems that the cold front coming from the north is spreading to the center. General temperatures are falling and there will be a risk of ice in the north and east. But it will get better during the week. Some temperatures: 45 in Brest, 48 in Paris, 41 in Lille, 36 in Mulhouse, 36 in Metz, 37 in Nancy, 55 in Perpignan and 59 in Ajaccio. I hope you still have a great weekend. - Here's Catherine, for the weather. - Thank you, Laura. I have just been told that Halim Djavaoui was assassinated Paris. He was the leader of the FLNRS we were speaking about earlier. - Send the picture. - Here you go. A figure of the fundamentalist rebellion who has died at under 40 years of age. I met him two years ago in the Middle East, he enjoyed great prestige among the youth of his country. It is even said that in the last few months, he had found support in the army. Djavaoui was an unusual force, - and his caution? - She's good at improvising. Yeah, she's a pro, but we're still going over 20:30. No, she'll skip the last subject. ?that seems most surprising in this assassination. So much for this last minute news that we won't miss to develop in our next editions, I'll see you tomorrow - at 8 pm. See you tomorrow. - What'd I tell you? - Credits. - Here we go. - See you all tomorrow, thank you. - Good evening Catherine, thank you all. - Where is he? - You amazed me. - That's my job. Where is he? - In my office. - Who are you talking about? - Maret. I'm talking about Dorget. - Did he leave? - He was in a hurry? - I told you he was waiting for me! - Well, I told him! Hi. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi, Gabriel. - How are you, Yves? - Good. - You're back from your trip with Mar?che? Yes, it's getting better, yes. So what's going on here? The cops forbade us to enter the apartment where Djavaoui was killed. - Who's on the case? - Chief Giovanetti. Ah! Giovanetti! He had to make a statement, and it's been two hours. - Well, good luck guys, see you. - OK. - Your card, sir! - Piss off. Hey, Giova. All I needed was you. Well, I knew you were going to give a press conference. What's up? Shall I come? - He couldn't keep you, Mar?che? - Well, no. He released me. Okay. What do you want? It seems impossible to me that Djavaoui let his guard down. He'd only have opened for someone he knew. He didn't open anything at all. The doors were broken into. The one in the entrance and the one in the apartment. It was a pro job. - Like Mar?che. - Mar?che? Say, that's a bit much. It is possible. When you find money and a good passport, why not? But he still didn't kill Djavaoui. Why are you telling me this? Because you won't talk about it until you have proof. No. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Uh? no. - Yes. Ah, she's beautiful, there. - Yes, isn't she? Well, that's enough. No? For a cover. Yes, yes. I'm quite happy. - You're charging a lot for this, right? - Yes. - I'm doing this for you, baby. - I know it. No, but it's good, it's very nice. You're doing better and better. Thank you. I have a little gift for you. A gift for me? - It's all bullshit. - You're telling me. No, but you can take 30 seconds for the Japanese demonstration. Then you put the headlines and? - You wanted to show me something? - Oh yes, in my office. - I'll give you five minutes, no more. - That's more than enough. Where did you get this? It was sent anonymously. - And what do you plan to do with it? - I don't know. I'm thinking. But you're wasting your time. You'll get nothing out of it, you know? - You think so? - Oh, I'm sure. Yes, but the minister made a fool of me. "I answer you no, three times no, no contact with Djavaoui? Is that clear?" Well, maybe he didn't know. A government spokesman? That'd really be something. No, he was playing with me. Really. And therefore, yours. - Don't make everything personal. - Oh, I'm not. I don't like the ridiculous. Well, you know that nobody remembers what they say on television. Except when the newspapers reproduce it. - Give me that. Give me that! - No! It's mine! Don't act like a child. - You're here to see the demonstration? - Yes. Goodbye. It doesn't make sense, dear. I haven't seen Halim Djavaoui in two years. Maybe more. You were right to warn me. - I only did my duty, sir. - I'll remember that. Goodbye. Hello. Do you have anything on Catherine Carr?? Television, yes. I want a complete file. He'll never know why? Oh shit? You've been robbed, Cathie. Shit? No, but it wasn't money he wanted. When they find it, they take it anyway. I'll call the police. No! No, I'll call tomorrow. It's too late now. - You're not working this week. - Not on the air, but I am working. Leave it. I'd rather you went home to sleep tonight. - Do you love me? - I love you as much as I can. - Will you accompany me to the trials? - Go away. Yes, I'll go with you to the trials if you promise to win. Come on, don't be mad at me. Don't be mad at me, huh? Say! Yes, hello Yves, did I wake you? It's Catherine. Catherine. Catherine Carr?, does that ring a bell? No no, it's okay, but I need to talk to you tomorrow. If you want, at home, before 11 o'clock. Okay. Sorry to have? woken you up. What can be said at this point of the case is that Chief Giovanetti's statements have not been cleared up, but we will do our best to do so. - Hello. - Hello, it's open. - I'm late, a little. - Yes. A little, yes. I finished my paper, I was about to leave. - You live alone here, if I understand. - Yes, and? I don't know. - What do you want? - I need some advice. - Advice? You? - Yes. Look at that. - What is it about? - Well, I'll explain. What did you do with your wife? She politely fired me, if you must know. - Because of you, by the way. - Because of me? Don't tell me I was the first. Well, since I got married, yes, I was a good father and husband. And a good lover. - Well, I really have to go. - No, Yves. - I'm on to something big. - Me too, actually. Then you can explain it all to me later. - But where are you going? - To Honfleur! How long for? No.t long I go back and forth, get a paper, come back. - Well then, I'll go with you. - Oh no, no. - No. - Yes! Yes, I will talk to you on the way. - There's no heat in the car. - I love that. What a pain in the ass! - Where's your car? - That one there. - This? We'll take mine, then. - No. - Yes, yes, you'll drive, come on. - No! You must make a good living on TV. Get in. No, I have connections in the car industry. Yes, that's right, the runner. He must be a great conversationalist. Conversation isn't what I ask him for. Get out. - Why? - It's for the best. We'll bicker. I don't feel like bickering, I'd love to go to Deauville with you. Well, too bad, because we're going to Honfleur. - Yes. It's the same thing. - Not at all! Then not at all! Mareche mustn't have had such a fun time with you for two hours. You're a snake. Right? You really are. You've still got your pretty little snake mouth on you. What a shame. It's her, it's her! - Are you Catherine Carr?? - Yes, it's me. It's nice to see you like this in the flesh. I told you it was her! - Excuse him, he admires you so much. - Hello. 200 francs. Say, is that Catherine Carr? with you? - Yes, so what? - Nothing, I was just saying that? An autograph, please. Thank you. - You like that, don't you? - I'm not going to bite them. Well, no. No, but you could do this. Look. There. - It's worse with the dark glasses. - Is that so? Really? People get curious about who's behind them. - Does it go with the hat? - You look good in it. - It's open. Very well. Thank you. - Hello. - Ma'm, can we have lunch? - Ah, it's too late, sir. In this season, after two, we don't serve anymore. Oh, please, ma'am? Catherine Carr? Wow. - Is it really you? - Yes. - Then please, have a seat. - Thank you. They'll make a real effort for you in the kitchen. Would you like to start with a porcini omelette? - Yes, very good. - I'll have a pitcher of wine brought over. Is the omelet okay for you? Yes. I would have preferred morels. But anyway? I'm cold, look. My nose is frozen. What are you playing at, Catherine? I don't know. We'll find out. Here is the bread. - I know you too. - Ah, I've been here before. - I have a house in the country. - No, it's not that. That's not it at all. You are? You are the gangster who took the journalist hostage. No, I'm the journalist that the gangster took hostage. - Yes, well, it's the same thing. - Yes, I guess. Yes, what I mean is, you were on TV. - Once, yes, just once. - That's enough. Yes. Thank you. Miss, I am very honored. So you're the journalist? Uh, yes. May I shake your hand? You were brave. Oh, you're sweet, no. You know, there's not much to do. He could have bumped you off too. - No? Well, yes. - There's no respect anymore. Mr. George? The check please. See how nice it is to be famous? You didn't bite them either. At noon, I watch the tape by myself. At three, I show it to the president who turns apple green. And in the evening I get broken into, all the tapes are gone. - Maybe it's just a coincidence. - Maybe. - So was this morning's information. - What information? They're buying the two nuclear plants from us. It's a done deal. So it's quid pro quo. We do them the service of killing Djavaoui or let him be killed, and they thank us, they buy the plants from us, maybe. - It's hard to verify. - Well, we have to find Mar?che. Why Mar?che? Because it was he who opened the door to Djavaoui. The police told me. And somewhere I have the address of Mar?che's wife, I need to get my hands on it again, that's why I came here. Yes, but what do I do with my tape? I feel like I have a grenade in my hands. The problem with grenades is, you can't blow up with them. I could never get a fire started. Let me. Fine. You were never a boy scout. - You were a scout? - Yes. - Do you have any matches? - Here. I should have known better, though. - Girl Scout leader, I bet. - Absolutely, that's right. I was 13 years old, with a round hat and small braids. Small braids and small teeth, already long, long, long? You'll always amaze me. Good luck. I love this stuff. And it's going to get hard, unless Mar?che kidnaps me, you're way ahead. Oh, don't talk nonsense Catherine, you're getting on my nerves! I abhor competition. - Easy to say when you've already won. - What have I won? A reputation for courage. Reputation is the echo of other people's stupidity. - How kind. - No, listen, Catherine. You're pushy? No, I am ambitious. - If you want. - I want. So you're ambitious? And you've attained a celebrity that fulfills you? - With more advantages than disadvantages. - At what price? What does that mean, at what price? Why did you leave me, Catherine? How can one know such a thing? - I loved you until? - Until I loved you? That's part of it. Remember what I posted in my office at the newspaper? Oh yes. And I remember that. "Do you really want to climb the ladder? If you're going to end up hanged?" - It's by Michaux. - Yes, it's stupid anyway. I like winners. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Is it shameful to sleep with winners to make a career? - You have to be a woman to answer that. - Exactly, you have to be a woman. And believe me, it's not that simple. My career was made by the audience. I don't sleep with them. I respect them. I work, I work my ass off for them. I do too. And I don't brag about it. - It wouldn't have the same effect. - You're wrong. - Women would like you. - So you think. Well, yes. I liked you. Go ahead. Scratch. You can have fun, baby. The scar is healed. I don't know where I put it. Mar?che's wife's address. Oh. Here it is. We can go. Grandma! I know I can trust you, Mr. Dorget. That's not the point? But do you realize if something happens to him? But for God's sake, I might be the only one left who can still help him! I know! But? I can't. I can't! Good! Good, good. Too bad. - I thought we'd be regulars here. - Why are you telling me this? You know why I'm telling you this. Mr. Dorget! Put an ad in your newspaper. "Peggy will be waiting for Bob at the station at 3:00." You specify the date. - Gare de l'Est. Platform 25. - Thank you. NEWS - What do you want from me? - Djavaoui. Are you in on it? Yes, I opened the doors, but I didn't shoot. Who was the shooter? I don't know. Who were you working for? I can't tell you that. The secret service? - French? - No, DEMETEC. Don't ask me more. You're not the type to do that. A real passport is priceless. Okay. Thank you. That's okay, we're even. - Have you seen my kids? - Yes. They're fine. Take care of yourself. You can't trust these people. MARECHE TOLD ME: I SAW DJAVAOUI SHOT You're taking me for a ride, Dorget! Not at all, Chief, I'm protecting my sources. - Your source is an murderer. - No. - Yes! - He's a burglar, not a killer. - You won't put me in touch with him? - No. We refuse. Very well. Mr. Dorget, you'll be brought before a judge. And you will be cited as an accomplice. Goodbye, gentlemen. Where are we headed? He could put you on the lam. Yeah, it's not up to him. He'll have me hauled in, and then? And then what? What if you get a judge who doesn't like the press? But we have to stop this right now! Call me the Interior Minister! I don't want to stop you there. Readers are interested in what you have to say. Either I am very wrong or the minister will send you packing. They're using Mar?che to cover up a conspiracy! I'm telling you! Andre! Poor Mar?che. - You're not going soft, are you? - No! Thank you, Miss. Yes, hello, Minister. I'm taking the liberty of disturbing you for something? One of my colleagues, Yves Dorget, is being unfairly pursued by Chief Berchner. Yves Dorget, yes. Ah, you see what this is about? Yes, certainly, yes. When? Okay. Okay, thank you, Minister. Yes well, he wants to see me. I don't like that. Dorget was arrested. No, put it in the archives. It's nice of you to come and have lunch with me. Thank you for seeing me so quickly, Mr. Minister. Please. Come on, please. Hello. I saw your president yesterday, and he is very proud of you. - Is that true? - Oh yes. And I can see why. - You're sort of his creation, aren't you? - He's the one who gave me my segment. - People must be jealous. - Some people don't like me. - They tell you? - Rarely, but they write to me. "I don't like your voice." Thank you. "You have a silly smile." "I don't like your red dress." And a little bit of everything. - But the majority is with you. - The polls are good, yes. I wish I could say the same for the government. - Things are not going well right now. - What's on your mind? Well, nothing? The political climate. The economic situation? - And the assassination of Djavaoui? - Less so. - And you? - Me? No. No, but it's a big deal. No, Ms. Carr?, it's not a big deal. This is a commonplace incident. A mobster's crime is being blown out of proportion by your friend Dorget. Yes, that's the Interior's version. The version. "The version." You journalists are amazing. Between the Interior Minister and a gangster's word, who do you trust? - The gangster? - I didn't say that, Minister. But I'm saddened that a colleague of mine was arrested. - It seems that you like Dorget. - Yes, I like him. But the whole press likes Dorget. - If I were his friend? - You wouldn't have put him in jail. I had nothing to do with it. The investigating judge is independent. But he still couldn't let this challenge to common sense go by. One must denounce evildoers. I find it hard to believe that you would turn in all the criminals you know. But you know very well that Dorget is mistaken in this matter. Dorget is a hunting dog. When he gets a lead, he follows it. The hunt is over, where he is now. And it'll stay over as long as necessary. Do you intend to keep him in prison for long? As long as the judge needs. You will have the whole press against you. Do you know that? I'm used to it. - Be careful, dear Catherine Carr?. - Me? Your president's time is up. He will have to be replaced. The cupboards will open. You never know how the chips will fall. It's all Greek to me, sir. I'm sure you understand everything, smart as you are. Even Greek. - You're never careful? - It's okay. All right, quiet! Quiet! - Dorget will not give in! You know him. - Well, I hope he won't give in! He told the judge to go to hell, and since the judge won't give in either, this kind of crap can last a long time. The government has to. We still have a free press, right? Judge Yorel is a first-rate hypocrite, that's well known. Dorget is right. This is about funding. - I would like to say... - They'll be on his side! You have to go to the Minister of Justice! - We are the 4th power. - I would like to say... We have to act now. It's now or never. - I would like to say... - We must put the politicians in jail. Jail isn't the issue. This is about principles. - I would like to say... - When principles go out the window, you do something about it. - I would like to say! - Let's take to the streets! - I would like to say! - Yes, well say it! I don't agree. What do you disagree with? I don't agree with the interview of a mobster on the run. - Oh, my? - We're not going to do this again? Listen, we'll send you to the Turks, you'll see if they agree. You're a bit fascist, aren't you? What are you even doing at this paper? Enough. What about the truth? What about the truth? The reader? Who cares about the people? We're telling them that the leader of the FLNRS was assassinated by mistake! By mistake. Do you find that moral? No. - Well, I would like to say... - Now you've said it! So enough! The truth is like onions, it has 18 layers! But it can also emerge from the mouth of a gangster! Commentary is free, but facts are sacred. - True. - Okay. So I propose that a delegation be received by the Minister of Justice, tomorrow. - Amen. - I couldn't agree more. I didn't think it was that hard to get a visitor's permit. It depends on the judge. If your minister intervened, it mustn'have made things better. On the contrary. Here, try this. How's that? The license, the professional card. The visiting permit, you show this. Leave the card at the front desk. - They give it back on your way out. - Okay. Jacket. They know it well. And my briefcase. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm doing this for Dorget. I owe him that much. I warn you, if you get caught, I will accuse you of theft. Yes. Yes, I know. You know, I have? DETENTION CENTER COURTS ADMINISTRATION Good morning. Please take Ms. Santini to the visiting room. Well, it's you. I had to warn you. They're after you, and they won't let you go. - Are they keeping me for six months? - If it suits them. Do you understand? How do you keep busy here? I work. When I was six years old, I started a book on the press in the 19th century: Hugo, his son, etc. So here, I have time to work. You're funny with your little hat. You're no fun as a convict. - What can I do to get you out of here? - Nothing. You have to stand on principle. That's all. A gagged journalist, 300,000 readers blinded. But they're protesting, and so is the press. We have already been politely asked not to talk about you anymore. - And you obeyed? - We do what we can. Really! Catherine? Don't get upset. They'll let me go when they get Mar?che. But they won't get him. They'll get him. They'll get him when they want to. He's small fry. We made him into what he became. Us, the press! - You sound like a minister. - Ministers aren't necessarily stupid. They're powerless, but not stupid. In the meantime, he's the one cheating, and you're the one in jail. Listen, don't play your Tosca, Catherine. They're not going to execute me. Besides, ministers come and go. Journalists? They last. This is how you see things? I see this as one more episode in the old struggle between the press and the state. The old struggle in which you, TV journalists, are spectators. Goodbye. WRONGDOER XAVIER MARECHE KILLED IN THE DAMASCUS AIRPORT - No, don't cut! - Yes! No, leave it! There! There, you cut. How much is that? Well, all in all, one minute twelve. Yes. - Mar?che was killed. - Really? - Are we doing a short with an insert? - No, no. No, it's worth much more. We're in a hurry. Attention please, on air in 20 seconds, thank you. - You know what you're risking? - Me? Nothing. - I'm just following orders. - Thank you. Here we go. Come on, come on, let's get moving! Good evening. Xavier Mar?che was shot dead today at Damascus airport by security services. His death will not help the ongoing investigation into the murder of Halim Djavaoui. Indeed, the police services held Mar?che as the main person responsible for the murder of the leader of the FLNRS. However, Mar?che had specified during an interview granted to Yves Dorget that he had seen Halim Djavaoui shot. For having collected this interview, Yves Dorget is still in prison. Here, in this complex case, you will see an exceptional document. This is Halim Djavaoui, received on Thursday, March 14 on the back steps of Matignon by the Prime Minister. This video contradicts the statement made in this room by the State Minister that there has never been official contact - between the state and Halim Djavaoui. - She's nuts! Qualification tests? - What's wrong? - Something serious. - When are you coming back? - When I find a job. Cut. Thanks everyone. - Give me the tape. - What tape? Don't play dumb. This story is going to cost you. - What story? - I want the radio copy. Sorry, we're not allowed. I'll tell you what you're allowed to do. We don't release that copy. - You're expected at the conference. - Do it without me. Like grown-ups. All right. Everything will be fine, thank you G?rard. Where are you going? - I'm expected for dinner. - They'll wait. - So you're happy with yourself, are you? - Yes. I've been supporting you for years. You're not that well-liked here. The higher-ups even less. They've been waiting for you to screw up for a while, me too. And you give them your head like that, on a silver platter. But why on earth, why? Throwing it all away for three minutes of fun? Why did you do that? Why the hell did you do that? - You wouldn't understand. - I'm too stupid, is that it? No, but you're too old. Here. Goodbye. Hello. - How are you? - Good. No, I'm keeping it. How are you, Cathie? You're the first one, they're late. - Did you see the paper? - The piece on me was nice. No, I'm talking about television. - Sorry, I was working late? - Didn't you look? Listen, I watch you every night Cathie, today I couldn't. - You could say you're unlucky. - Am I unlucky? - I have a nice car, a mistress? - You had a mistress. Catherine, what's wrong? - Good evening. - You were wonderful, Catherine. That's nice, but I have to go now. But Remi is here. We'll talk later. Goodbye. Good evening R?mi. Catherine was fantastic tonight. Did you see her? No, I haven't seen it. No, I haven't seen it. Once in six months, I'm allowed, right? DETENTION CENTER - You didn't put on your little hat? - No. You're not here for a story? - So you came looking for me. - Yes. I thought you had Catherine Carr? on a tight leash. With women, you never know. We were wrong to put her on TV. Don't be ridiculous. Are you network president or not? - Yes. - So you are responsible! Mr. Minister, I don't understand. When I told the Prime Minister, I told her that Catherine Carr? had this tape. You are mistaken, you never met the Prime Minister. You knew of the nature of this film. - Do you admit it? - Naturally, since it's me? You have no excuse! You won't be reappointed. Mr. Minister, I did everything I could to prevent this incident. It's Mrs. Carr? who planned it, she even bribed a technician! And if anyone should pay, it's her. And if I pay, she'll pay! That's very clever, right when that bitch is being made a national hero! 74% of French people approve of her showing this document! How does that sound? All that's left is to make her a martyr now. If I may say so, Mr. Minister, we need to come up with a response. - Do you have an idea? - I think so. Bourret, show the president out. Go ahead. Mar?che is dead, so no more witnesses. And the tape? - We'll say it was from two years ago. - Why two years ago? Because two years ago, the Prime Minister actually met Djavaoui at Matignon. That's not bad. You ask to be heard out, you set the record straight, and we discredit Catherine Carr? in the process. That's good. That's very good. - So I was right? - Yes. - You're pleased with your student? - Yes. I'm your sweetheart? Who else? Yes, you. Do you call all women that? No. You're lying. Yes, I'm lying. Like you sweet women. I guess you could say I got more than I bargained for. - I'm hungry. - I'll take you to dinner. - What are you going to do now? - I'm going to get fired. - They won't dare. - Yes, they will. Yes, they will. I'm going to get paid, but in a closet. The French approve of Catherine Carr?. 74% of those surveyed say they approve of the release of the document showing the meeting of the Prime Minister and the leader of the FLNRS. This massive approval comes as our colleague was the victim of an misinformation campaign. The document you have seen was indeed filmed by a foreign network, but two years ago. The Prime Minister did indeed meet with Mr. Halim Djavaoui. - But that was 23 months ago. - That son of a bitch. That bastard. I don't quite understand. The Italian photographer tricked you? No! I'm sure of it. - I checked it all out. - How sure are you? The guy behind the Prime Minister. You remember, the bald guy. - Do you know him? - No. Michel Barrer, the chief of staff. And how long has Barrer been at Matignon? For two months. Not 23. Oh the bastard? Now what do I look like? You look like you wanted to make a move and missed. - But you know that's not true! - Yes, but I don't matter. - I'm going to get taken down tomorrow. - They'll certainly go after you. You can do something for me. - Something important. - Name it. What do you want? You have to write in your newspaper that my information was good, and that I did my duty by passing it on. If you back me, - with your credit? - No, I can't do that, Catherine. Why? Villechaise won't stop you. - No, I don't think he'd refuse, but? - But what? Are you afraid I'm wrong? Well, go check it out for yourself. Go and ask how long Barrer has been at Matignon. 23 months ago, he was in Washington! That's good, but not enough. What we need is to authenticate the exact date of the meeting. Exact date. Yes? No, I don't have a statement to make. No, no comment! Don't answer! No, she's not in. I don't know. They're not going to stop bothering you now. If you want peace and quiet, go to Honfleur. - Nobody will find you. - In Honfleur? I'll see what I can do for you. - Do you have five minutes? - For you, yes. Get back to the attack. What's the point of talent on the fifth line if the reader doesn't get past the third? Oh, what a bunch? What's up? What do we do about Catherine Carr?? We have a short article with a blurb on the front page. Maybe. - Who's on it? - Barbara, and she'll be tough. - Let me write it. - You? Not very classy, after what happened. Exactly. I would have liked to defend her. We can't defend her, she's forgotten all she learned here! - Andr?, I know that her document is good. - Oh yes, and how do you know? - The Prime Minister is dirty! - Do you have proof? Listen? Trust me. Don't treat me with Catherine, please. If I bring you a proof? I'm publishing tonight because I don't give a shit about the Prime Minister! But I need it to be rock solid! - Yves! I'll give you two hours. - Okay. Okay. - What are you looking at? - Legs. - Can't you wait until I leave? - But you've already left, Bruno. Go and see. - Yes? - I would like to speak to Bruno Brunolli. - He's upstairs. - Pardon me. - Brunolli? - Yes? - Yves Dorget. - Oh, right. I was just on my way out. - Yes, I see, where are you going? - To Milan. - For long? - I don't know yet. Well, you're going to delay your departure by a few minutes. - No! - Oh, but yes. Why are you here? - Because I need your testimony. - My testimony? About what? About the tape you gave to Catherine Carr?. Me? I never give her anything. - The tape you sold her! - Sold? To Catherine? I don't rat on friends. Did you or did you not give her a tape? I don't know what you're talking about, I'm in a hurry, I have a plane to catch. There are no flights to Milan right now. - Who said I was going to Milan? - You did! Well, I said that to trick you. Listen to me, Brunolli. I don't want to hurt you. - Do you understand that? - Yes. - Just write 10 lines. - Write what? Ten lines stating that the tape you gave to Catherine was shot on the 14th of the month. - No. - It wasn't shot on Thursday the 14th? Mr. Dorget, you are a journalist, right? So when you're asked to give up your sources, you refuse. And you prefer to go to jail, even when it's a gangster. And for that, I salute you. And if Catherine tells the cops that I gave her that tape, - then she can go to hell! - She didn't tell the cops! And who is the statement for? For your grandmother? Brunolli, I need proof that this tape was shot last week! - You'll get nothing. - I'll beat the shit out of you! You're not the type. Look, I won't say anything. I'm Italian, and sometimes it's best to have the courage to be a coward. When the wave passes, you lower your head and when you stand up, you're a little dirty. Stay if you want. Me, ciao. - It won't do you any good. I won't tell! - I know, Brunolli. Do you have a VCR somewhere? - Yes, in archives. - Thank you. - Hey, Morot. Where's the VCR? - Evening. - It's over there in the back. Why? - I'd like to see it. - Do you know how to use it? - No, I don't. - Is it urgent? - Yeah. That's it. ?declare in their turn that on pain of death? Go back upstairs. Stop. Rewind. - That's what we saw last night. - Yes, this is the original. Fast-forward. Stop, stop, stop. Go back. Stop. - Do you see the newspaper? - Yeah. - What's on the paper? - Well, a car. Yes, a Renault GT Turbo. - They presented it to the press a week go. - So? So, it's a great car, Morot! Give me the tape. - You're welcome. - Thank you very much. - Rock-solid proof. - Shut the door. No, I'm fine, thank you, I'll shave. The proof that her document is eight days old. - That's interesting. - Here. Come in! Give me five minutes in peace! You asked me for a bio of Michel Barrer, here! - I didn't ask for anything! - No, I did. Listen Yves, it's not urgent, we'll see about it tomorrow. - Michel Barrer's photos. - What the hell is going on? - What the hell? - It's my fault. But it's urgent. You'll have Catherine dragged through - the mud by that imbecile Barbara. - No, we're not cutting it. What? Why? - The info, but with no editorial. - Let me do the editorial! No Yves, not tonight! I need more time to think it over. The paper's ready, bar the first and last pages. We go to press at 10. This job is impossible now. At least look at this and listen to me! - Yves, there's no rush! - Yes, there is! - Yes, sir? - Tell my wife I'll meet her there. What do you have in there? Proof that the meeting between the Prime Minister and Djavaoui took place eight days ago, not two years ago, like they want us to believe! Interesting. Was this just you? - For now, yes. - Keep it fresh, and we'll see tomorrow. You can't keep this fresh. So we lured Djavaoui to France and betrayed him. Is that it? Let's say we neglected, in quotes, to ensure his safety. Here you go. - The mistake was to deny the meeting. - It's always their first instinct. Come in early tomorrow and we'll see how we can handle this. But Djavaoui, no one cares. On the other hand, Catherine against the Prime Minister is funny. Hey, Yves. I thought it was over, you and Catherine. Let's just say that for once you don't have the latest info. Get an interview with Catherine. Exclusive. Catherine? Yes. Good news. No, not exactly. Yes. I'll explain. I'm leaving right away. - Bravo! - Yes! Who says so? - So you're feeling better? - Yes, much better. This will warm your hands up. - Sorry, it's a little noisy tonight. - It's okay. Give us the same thing. - Be nice. - Yes. But we're gonna have fun, we'll fight. We're gonna fight together! - We'll fight against whom? - Not against, for! So that these little politicians stop saying whatever they want with impunity. So that your TV friends won't live with their heads in a noose anymore! - Here you are. - Thank you. - Here. - To honor. The lost honor of Catherine Carr?. You're going to get it back. As poor Mar?che used to say. Yes. But? Are you sure about Villechaise? Ah, for a case like this, absolutely, yes. As long as he has readers, he will be a free man. And since we have readers, knock on wood. - You're going to go for it. - There are two methods. The photo with the headline. - Shock treatment. - Or we go slower, 10 lines, "Catherine Carr? alleges she has proof," etc. "When questioned, she refused to deny or confirm?" That's the drip-drip method. We'll see tomorrow with Villechaise, won't we? It'll be fun. A national hero, Ms. Carr? pushes the Prime Minister to his limit! - He'll never forgive me. - Nor will his spokesperson. - No network will hire me after this. - No one anywhere. And in six months? Everyone will have forgotten me. Not me. Not me. You are beautiful. I like you. I am happy. Tango, Jeannot! Tango, Jeannot! Yeah! Come on, let's work a little? Mr. Dorget! Telephone. Excuse me. - Can you turn on the lights? - Right away. Go ahead, Jeannot! Take the cabin on the other side. Hold on, sir. Please hold on. - Isn't that Catherine Carr?, over there? - Yes, it is. - Hello, Yves? - Yes, I'm here, listening. What are you doing in Honfleur? Well, I have something to ask you, something annoying. - Something bad has happened. - What's happened? I need someone to cover Amman. How well do you know the Middle East? You scared me. I thought you didn't want the Catherine interview anymore. Sorry, go ahead. - Yves, have you been drinking or what? - I haven't been drinking. You have to go to Jordan. Are you Catherine Carr?? - Yes. - Yes? Please? Things are cracking down in Amman. I need you to cover it. - When do I leave? - Tomorrow. There's a flight at 2 pm. I'll get you an open ticket, either way. - Tomorrow? I can't. - Why? Because I'm not going to leave Catherine right now. Look, Catherine can wait! It's not that urgent. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. All of them? For Charlotte. - No, try someone else. - I am trying, but there's no one. You're such a pain in the ass. But I don't care about Jordan. Nobody cares about Jordan, by the way! I'm bringing Catherine's interview tomorrow. Just wait and see. No, it's going to make a lot of noise, you'll see. I won't see anything! Because tomorrow you're on a plane. No! No, I won't go. That bastard Villechaise wants to send me to Jordan. Go ahead. What's happening there is interesting. No, I'm interested in what's going on here. Come on. First question. Catherine Carr?, did you apologize to the minister? - No. - No. Do you plan to apologize publicly when you go back on the air? I will not apologize for making a mistake that I did not make. In your job, it is a mistake to get a member of the government in hot water, right? He got himself into trouble by denouncing an untruth and I only rectified it. You know that if you maintain your version of events, you will be fired from the newspaper? - I've already taken that risk. - Yes, that's good. You have to be specific about it. You're going to make a splash. Resign, maybe. No. I won't quit. Anyway, you will be replaced by someone more docile. No, not "docile". Don't write "docile". We're not docile. Understanding. Is "understanding" okay? It's up to each person to judge how to do this kind of job. Yes. One of our colleagues said to me: "Sometimes you have to have the courage to be a coward." "You lower your head, the wave passes, and when you get up, you're a little dirty, and that's it." - Who told you that? - It doesn't matter. So what do you say to that? - You need something snappy. - "The courage to be a coward?" I should have had that. That's not going to work at all. What's wrong with it? Well, because it sound like you regret what you did! Yes, but I do regret it, what do you think? That I should congratulate myself? It's the biggest mistake of my life. I had everything. Everything that makes me happy. And to? I don't know, to impress you, to? Playing the vestal virgin of the news, to the hardcore journalist, to be harder and purer than you, I just screwed everything up. Yes. I regret it, yes. No, that's not true. You want my truth, right? Well, that's the truth. Catherine! If I could fix it everything, I would. I'd get on hands and knees. - You would? - Yes. Don't give me a lesson in virtue, I'm not willing to hear it. I am unhappy, Yves. I am unhappy. Here. With this, you've got the minister by the short hairs. If you want to negotiate. Tell him you'll give up the tape as long as you get your job back. You can even ask for a raise while you're at it. That's called blackmail. It's tried and true. Yves, come on. If you leave now, Catherine, we will never see each other again. We will. No. Never. Can you give me a ride? - Where are you going? - To Jordan. - I'm not headed that way. - To Paris. Is that okay? Get in. - The news? Are you interested? - Yes. In Brussels, the representatives of Nuremberg have not yet agreed? Another terrorist attack in Beirut, a bomb explodes in the city center? I hope it's calmer in Jordan. In a statement, Matignon said that the Catherine Carr? case is closed. The management of the channel confirms that the popular journalist will tell on air tonight how she was victim of an impostor. What does that mean, an impostor? An impostor is a man who tries to pass himself off as something he isn't. A man? or a woman. I hope you enjoy your evening with us, at 8 pm, the news, Catherine Carr?. Good evening. Good evening. Qualifiers began this morning? The afternoon news? Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
