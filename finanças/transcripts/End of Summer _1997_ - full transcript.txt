It is almost the turn of the century. Change is in the air. But not in my world. I never feel comfortable in my father's house. My students love it. The servants are certainly at ease. This is the third message from the stock exchange this hour. Yes, yes, yes? It is my father's whole world, with his stocks and financial dealings. Otto! Otto! It's up another 12 points! Bully! Even my cousin lucie, who was my father's favorite, and her husband, feel more at home here than I ever will. We're up another $100,000. Ah, your latest creation. Now, the modern factory can produce this sort of thing faster, in greater quantity, and with more regularity. And cheaper. Much cheaper. Father, after class, I shall be leaving for the summer. I'm off to saratoga for 80 days. 80 days, is it? My. In today's world, everyone is traveling around the globe in that time, and here you are, year after year, heading off to saratoga with all your paraphernalia. You've no sense of adventure, my dear. Take care of yourself, father. Oh, nonsense. Uncle Ezra's as strong as any old bull on wall street, aren't you? Thank you. Ah, dear lady. Your room and your atelier await you. And might I say, on behalf of the entire staff, that it never truly feels as if the season has commenced until the arrival of our own dear muse, our miss Van buren. Thank you. Miss Van buren? Yes? Well, have I changed so? I'm Theo Elliott. Yes. Of course. Last time we would've seen each other was that summer. It was... My good word, I think it's been 20 years. I regret not inquiring after you. I rarely get back east. What a pleasant surprise to find you here. Well, we shall have much catching up to do. Meanwhile, welcome. Thank you. Till we meet again. Yes. Of course. Hello. Good evening. Christine. Miss Van buren, the reverend basil march. How do you do? I'm charmed. Christine, you're just in time. The young reverend shall now lead US in grace. Go right ahead, dear boy. Dear lord, who has blessed me with the company of such gracious dinner companions, gathered here in the sight of nature's beauty. For what we are about to receive, may the lord make US truly thankful. Amen. Amen. So be it, but when the railroad takes the civilization of the east out west, I for one am not so sure that'll be a very good thing. But you made your fortune on the railroad, sir. True. But fortune is one thing, peace is another. Things must be so very... Dusty. Very dusty. Different. Different. The renditions of the west I've seen have a grand beauty, but the isolation of it all. Yes, it is beautiful. I tell you, that land gets inside of you. Gets deeply inside of you. Goodness! In the old days, the help was American. Now they're all papists. In the book I'm writing, I shall demonstrate how the end of the normal institution of slavery has led to the degeneration of the American republic... General, I find this conversation distasteful. I fear them all... the papists, the negroid, the red Indian, the hindu, the slavics... I congratulate you, general. At least you're not prejudiced in your prejudices. A lively exchange of ideas. That's what makes america so American. I have also come east this summer from shaker heights, Ohio. I've come to do the lord's bidding. Oh, here, in saratoga? For the moment. Though he's calling me to bigger things. I'm on my way to the big city. You're looking at the man who's gonna build the largest cathedral in the world. Bigger than St. Paul's, bigger than St. Peter's. With ivory and gold and modern plumbing. Bravo. I've heard it said, sir, that a man goes west to find fortune or forget misfortune. Very astute, madam, however my misfortune was many years ago. Affair of a young man's heart. Christine can attest to my behavior in those days. Impractical, romantic, feverish, foolish. Really? Well, that's natural at that age. Perhaps at any age. Stand like this. You'll have more power. All right? Pull back. Just relish the stored tension there. It'll heighten the impact of release. Focus and impact and release. All right, let go. Bull's-eye. He is smitten with you. You can believe me. You have such merry spirits, Christine. Let him see that side of you. Hmm? Oh, Theo, how pleasant it is to see you. If you say so. Please continue. I'm sorry I interrupted you. I enjoy watching you work. My compliments to you, Christine. You really followed your ambition to create beautiful things. Though you appear afraid to touch it. I've seen hopi Indian women make these. They're celebrated for their pottery, the hopi women. They use dark earth colors and flowers and Clay. This one. I didn't know you were interested in pottery. This is lovely. You know, we haven't spoken about what happened so many years ago. Oh. No, we haven't. Well, it was a long time ago, Theo. It is of no avail. Well... I'm very happy to see you again. I'm sorry. It's nothing. You know, Christine, I have thoroughly enjoyed this last week. I have enjoyed it beyond measure. Yes, I have also. Living in the west, there's much here I had forgotten... Comfort, elegance, grace. I believe I've found these things again. Saratoga can cast a spell. Saratoga? But surely you must know I'm not talking about saratoga. ♪ 'Tis the last Rose of summer left blooming alone all her lovely companions are faded and gone no flower of her kindred no rosebud... ♪ This is the courtier's, his pride and joy left over from maypole day. I find it charming. Get in. No, no, no. Oh, but you appear afraid to touch it. Get in. Of course not. Don't be silly. Then get in. Yes? Yes. Ready? Yes. See, I must tell you that now that I've made my fortune, I've come back east here to enjoy it. So I've decided to cancel my return back west and spend the entire summer here in saratoga, with you. Theo! Pushing so. Theo. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did I frighten you? Just a little. Theo, please. Can I help you with that, ma'am? It's lovely Chestnut hair you have. And yours is as red as a fiery sun. When I was a girl, it was my bane. The boys loved to pull on the red braids. You know how boys be like. No, I don't know much about that sort of thing. A man I care for tried to kiss me tonight, and I turned away. My father says I have no sense of adventure. Jenny, what should I have done? You should've kissed him, ma'am. Yes. Maybe I will. Maybe I'll kiss him tomorrow. Theo. About last night... Listen, please forgive me. I was inappropriate, and it shall not happen again, I promise you. Miss Van buren. That's not what I mean. Hello! Oh, Alice, you have such beautiful things. Thank you. You seem surprised to see me. Mother had written? Well, I was expecting someone younger. You've grown, Alice. I know. I can't wait till I stop growing and just am. You know, miss Van buren... Christine. I'll call you Christine. I already am a woman in many ways. I've had my heart broken three times. Really? Once by a student in Florence, once by a gondolier in venice, and once by mother. Your mother? When she ordered my return from Italy. I have a letter for you from mother. Thank you. "Because she is headstrong and impetuous and inclined to having her head turned." So tell me, Christine, what exactly does one do here in saratoga? As this century draws to a close, we hear strange and unchristian philosophies being spoken. People say the world is coming to an end, and that all the incredible new machines and inventions we encounter come out of Satan's workshop. My friends, I assure you, this is all stuff and nonsense. The next century will be the American century. A great adventure, and you're all invited. I just hope it's not boring. If we were in Europe, in the rain, we'd be at a cafe or somewhere gay like that. I returned to europa two summers ago. It's all changed from the magic place I recalled it to be when I was a boy. During the holy Roman empire. Be calm, child. Find a book to read, sit down. Ugh. So dull. What is that? It's an animal. Why, this is outrageous for saratoga. What should we do? Come back. Don't go forward. Ha!! Bully! Well done! Well, not really. You see, a cat's instinct is to chase and kill, and if you just turn on him and say boo, they'll run away. Tell me about him. Theo? Um, well, we were students together. He was poor, but he won a scholarship. Oh, he was quite brilliant. I always had the feeling that he was gonna make something of his life. He's lived out west, and, uh... Apparently been quite successful with the railroads, railroad business, and... You were in love with him. How could I be? He was in love with someone else. Theo was a dreamer. He trusted people. And she was a... She was a shameless flirt. She broke his heart. And then he went away. And I never heard from him again. Last time I saw him, he was standing on a balcony by the sea, tears streaming down his face. I wished so that I could comfort him, but how could I? He'd been so hurt. So very hurt. I wondered how someone could be so hurt and survive. Well, he was wrong not to have fought for her. If I loved someone, I would fight. My dear, you look exquisite. Oh, I thought the colors would make me look like a piece of wobbly French furniture. The only wobbly thing I see is your walk and posture. Straighten up. Remember, a lady always glides. In Alabama where I come from, we have a custom. The youngest lady at the ball dances the first dance with the oldest gentleman. I don't think I'm the youngest lady. And I'm really from Mississippi. Stunning. I view heaven as a kind of spiritual country club. Only for the right people. We all need references. We've all gotta pay dues. No, thank you. My, oh, my, she is pretty. There are many lovely girls here tonight. Change partners. Take care, sir. She may tire you out. Madam, I fear you underestimate me. My, you're very busy tonight, Jenny. Yes. Tomorrow's my day off. Oh. What do you do on your day off? Oh, not much of anything. I don't really know anybody in these parts. I also come from far away, child. I'd like you to think of me as your friend. My, you've certainly made quite an impression on that young Jenny. I? Really? Oh, yes. I swear, it was all she could talk about. I shall be walking with her by the lake tomorrow. After breakfast. Well, Mr. Elliott, it looks like you have cornered the market. Yes, they're both quite lovely, aren't they? The young one and the older one. Well, look at it this way. You choose the young one, one day, you'll get an older one thrown into the bargain. In america, Jenny, a person can grow above his station in life. In Ireland, even the grand folks seem poor. People like myself and, for example, the young reverend basil march, are Democratic in our thinking. Hello. Oh, basil march! Why, speak of the devil. On the contrary. Oh, drat. I'd so looked forward to spending the afternoon finishing reading my novel, but I've forgotten it in my room. My dears, I'll catch up with you. Allow me. Tell me, how many cards do you have now? I do not know. Five? I do believe I've given you one too many. It's father. Oh, my god. He suffered a stroke. I must go to him right away. I shall help you pack. I'll arrange for a coach. Christine, wait up. You know, I can pack a bag in a minute and come with you. Oh, dear Theo. I wouldn't want anyone to follow me into that hot city. But this is a difficult circumstance. Are you certain you'll be all right traveling alone? Yes. I'm quite used to that. Driver, stop. Alice? You must behave, child. I fear you have no sense of propriety. Such high spirits. What are we to do with you? In your absence, you can rely on me to act on your behalf. You see, Christine? Our prayers have been answered. Come on. Thank you, Vera. Safe home. I shall miss you. How strange it has been, our meeting again like this, after all these years. And now, this separation. It's hard to fathom. God moves in mysterious ways. His wonders to perform. Driver. Till we meet again. Till we meet again. Father, I came as soon as I could. How are you feeling? I shall die. I leave behind nothing. No good works. Help me. Oh, yes. Please. You. You alone. Come. You're tiring him. Be calm, father. Be calm. Come, Christine. We have matters to conclude. Just a minute. I'll come back and see you later. Father's illness couldn't have come at a worse time. For everyone concerned. I refuse to discuss the will of a man who is still living. It's not just the will. We need your consent to sell certain properties. Yes. We believe that the economy's overheating. Father's not the only one who could keel over. Don't concern yourself, Christine. Your financial needs will be met. Yes. We would like you to dedicate your time to your lovely object d'art and your soup tureens. Your brother is wrong. The economy is fine. We're rich, and we're staying rich, and we're getting richer and richer. Oh, Otto, you are such a bull. You're damn right I am. Look at the products this country is turning out. Christine, you'll appreciate this. You're artistically inclined. Huh? Good heavens! Ha ha! Gold plated. How... Extraordinary. We never see enough of you. Make lots of money, darling. Sit. So, what does he look like? Does Theo remember me? You must tell me everything. Oh. Most of these plants here you can actually grind up and eat, if it so happens that you were starving to death. Matter of fact, the woods are filled with things you can eat. We'd better find the others. Why are you laughing? This is not funny. Yes, it is. How could so great a woodsman lose the trail? Let's head for that barn. All right, here it is. Oh, bother. I'm sure you've seen more than your share of women in their petticoats. Not really. The women out west don't wear them anymore. Well, good for them. They're ridiculous and cumbersome things. Listen. Thunder. You built a lovely fire. All the logs are crossed, one on top of the other. Did you know, once upon a time, I knew a young blonde girl just like you, just as beautiful? Just as impertinent. I'm cold. These clothes are cold. Make me warm. We sat out the storm. Child, you cannot conduct yourself so. If I had known Christine would be away for over a month, I would never have taken on this responsibility. A girl's reputation, once lost... I would rather lose my reputation than my health. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, it is a shame that you had to leave at this juncture. That girl spells trouble. You must get her back to Chicago. Oh, buffalo. Set your nets, Christine. I have no talent for that kind of thing. Perhaps we could find an eye-catching daffodil gown for you to wear, or better still, cherry pink. Those colors do not suit me. You will lose him. Amuse yourself with him. Wrap him around your little finger. Oh, you have no sense of adventure. I would not want him that way. You will lose him. As I once did? Oh, you are so high-minded, Christine. But you have emotions, good ones and base ones, just like the rest of US. You'll hurt someone one day. As you did? Do you mean Theo? I couldn't afford to love Theo. I was poor, Christine. That's a station in life you know nothing about. I don't think I really hurt him. We were all too young to feel pain. Today, it's different. For no reason at all, I seem to succumb to vapors. What...? This is cocaine. It's been used for thousands of years by the south American Indians. I take it on my doctor's advice. Then depression must be unknown among the south Americans. Yes. They're all ever so jolly. You know, it is surprising that Theo never married. You said he appears well-to-do. Hmm? How gloriously vibrant this evening is. Do you feel it? That's because we are in love. We're in love? Mm-hmm. What in the realm of day do you know about being in love? I've been in love before. Really? Come here. What do you mean, you've been in love? You see, I've been writing to the archdiocese for months, and finally, they've agreed to see me. I'm to be offered a ministry in Manhattan, I'm sure of it. Just think of it, Jenny. The fine people I'll meet. I shall miss you. Now, now, it's god's plan for me. We mustn't fight it. ♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath... ♪ Basil. Oh, madam Vera. It's going to happen. I feel like my prayers are finally going to be answered. It is divine to have one's prayers answered. You're a woman of the world. I needn't explain to you the value of society and the right sort of people. Indeed, you need not. And now, you must give me money for introducing you to Jenny Malone. What? What you make of your liaison with the girl is your own business, but when I perform this kind of... Favor... I expect my reward. Here and now. After all, it's hardly the kind of thing for which I can expect a reward in the next world. I have neither the resources nor the inclination to pay you. Oh, I meant no claim on your inclination, but as to your resources, how fortunate that Providence has chosen this moment to blow you in the direction of polite society. Because I am not polite. I could make public my debt, here in saratoga, or along fifth Avenue. You'll build your church. I build mine. The bishop has promised me a parish in Manhattan if I can distinguish myself with some great work. That is good. Yes. Of course, everyone sends their affection and concerned regards. Oh, it's nice to hear one is remembered. What is the latest news from that happy place, saratoga? It appears that a group of the guests had an encounter with some socialist free-thinkers. Really? And now, miss Alice Anderson is going around talking free love. That's dreadful. She seems pretty smitten with Theo Elliott, and they always seem to be together. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but people do love to talk. Miss Van buren? Oh, poor lady. Alone at this time. And your father. It must be hard to see someone die. Yes. Even harder... To see someone cursing their life. My father is not an evil man. No worse than the times he's lived in. He needs to find peace. He needs references. Yes, that's it. That's to be our plan. References to get into that great country club. I beg your pardon. Please, madam, let me meet your father and try to comfort him. I can be of service. What is taking so long? They've been talking all day. It is in the gospel that you will find the true shining path to salvation. It's here in the good book that the lord gives US his words. Here is where we found the peace that passes all understanding. What do you remember of your earlier religious instruction, maybe when you were a child? Very, very little. I want you to feel the power of this book. Take it, look at the pages. We shall pray together for enlightenment, for peace, for guidance, for the light. "For the word was with god, and the word was god. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. And in him was life. And the life was the light of man." Ezra Van buren, you have done a powerful thing. A magnificent thing. "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh. But the earth abideth forever." Amen. Ezra, you're ready. In the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost, I baptize thee, Ezra Van buren, into the holy church. Amen. Your father shall live in eternity. And we shall construct the largest cathedral in the Christian world, all in the name of Ezra Van buren. Ezra Van buren and god. Father. Oh, father. A will drawn under those circumstances will fail. The lord be praised. If you contest father's will, you will find me on the other side. Father died in peace, which is more than we ever gave him. She turns against her own family. Oh, be still, woman. Father left a fortune, large enough for all of US. We shall not go hungry. Christine, this man used you to get to father. Perhaps he did. Or perhaps that's what he was meant to do. Oh, Christine. God works in mysterious ways. His wonders to perform. Oh! Whoa. Christine, my sincere condolences. I was very saddened to hear about your father. It's good to see you again. We have missed you. Allow me to help you with your bags. That's all right, sir. I have it. But you have your own bags to attend to. Sir. Basil. You must stop calling Theo sir. You make him sound like an old man. Why, yes, basil, do stop. Christine! Vera. Theo. I loathe bluntness. Under the circumstances, I feel I have no other options. I must protest the fact that you are amusing yourself with this child at the expense of her reputation, and my own. Your reputation? As a fit chaperone. So your only concern in this matter is as her chaperone. At her age, passions can race ahead of judgment. Passions can race at any age. And Alice isn't a child. Theo, I beg you to understand my predicament. I stand in the place of her parents. I must know... Your intentions. I've asked her to marry me. Then the matter is resolved. Not in its entirety. Fact of the matter is, Alice has not yet replied. A lady glides. How dare you write against me? That was addressed to your parents in confidence. Oh, Alice, how could you do such a thing? I had a right to hear how you despise me. I do not despise you, child. I just... I merely did what I felt I have to do. I can no longer, as your parents' agent, condone this kind of behavior. You are nothing but a jealous old maid, trying to shape me as if I were a piece of your damn pottery. All right. Send your letter. My parents love and adore me. They'll understand. They'll read your letter, but they will listen to me. I do believe a great door has opened in my life, thanks to you. Are you not feeling well? I could not sleep again last night. My head is so full of plans. My father's bequest would serve as a good foundation for your cathedral. But I should like to introduce you to other enlightened people who might be interested in your great work. Dear lady, dear friend, I do believe I should call you that. However shall I repay you for your kindness? Maybe we can think of a way. "So I summon you here with all the urgency at my command and I beg you not to think too harshly of your ineffectual friend, Christine Van buren." Pshaw, Christine's too hard on herself. That child's a hellion. I suppose we'll have to go. Oh, we're getting off easy this time, father. It's only six hours' ride to saratoga. Mother, we sent her to england, and she got engaged. We sent her to Italy, and she got engaged twice. She even found a way of getting engaged at an all-girls' boarding school. Mother, I ask you. What's next? Argentina. When your father asks me if we're engaged, what should I tell him? Fine. When he asks me, I'll kiss him. I hope all this awful attention we're receiving will die down. I don't think I could bear it much longer. Oh, stop it. You love it. I can't deny, I do enjoy watching Christine squirm. Sometimes, you do act like a child. And sometimes, you like it. She despises US both. She herself is truly hateful. Don't say that. Christine only did what she thought she had to do. Where are you going? Alice! I was looking for you. Basil. I was working on a new sermon I think you'll enjoy. I'll be addressing the rights of women and negroes. Basil, what rights? Well, we're all part of god's plan, and with the new century coming on, maybe it's time to reexamine that plan. Do tell me more. Jenny. Jenny! Oh! Here. Do it. Alice, I wanna speak to basil, leave US alone. Theo, don't be jealous. Just leave US alone. Elliott, I can assure you, nothing transpired with... That girl, Jenny Malone, is pregnant. And I shall pray for the poor creature. Oh, horseshit! You're the father of that child, and you know it. You're a man of god, now honor your commitment to him. It would be with my back to god. I'll never be able to serve him in the style I had planned on if I'm tied to a girl like that. Well, you have no choice. No one else knows about this unfortunate matter, do they? So what? I warn you, sir. If you denounce me, you will only ruin Jenny by making public her shame. Reverend, you are beneath contempt. Really? Well, you'd know what it was like to spurn one woman when something better comes along. Stop it, lads. Stop it! Stop it, lads. Stop it or I'll thrash you both. Elliott, Elliott. Are you all right, son? Theo. How could you? Is there nothing left of the man I once knew? The matter has gone further than Jenny and myself. She's pregnant. Yes. Once again, I can be of service to you. I can only assume this shan't be an instance of Christian charity. I'm shocked at your lack of faith in pure human kindness. Madam Vera says she'll be introducing me to other gentlemen in New York who'll help me, like she did with the reverend basil march. You don't have to worry about madam Vera. You're not going to New York. I have a letter of introduction for you to my friend John Marshall, quartz hill, Oklahoma territory. He's a good man. This is money for the train, also a little extra. This is the letter. It introduces you as a recent widow and a friend of mine. John Marshall will find you employment. Listen to me, Jenny. Oklahoma is very, very hard work. But you'll have great rewards, and a great adventure. God bless you, sir. Driver. Christine was right about you. You're quite amusing for a man of god. I like to think of myself as a man of god, and a man of the future. I do try to keep an open mind. I'd like you both to come to church on sunday. I'm going to arrange a special mystery event in your honor. Alice. Alice was right about basil. He cuts a fine figure. I like Mr. Elliott, too. Seems a fine man. Yes, a fine man. Not a fine young man. But a fine man. Jenny, could I please have a cup of tea? Jenny's gone, ma'am. She left all of a sudden. They say she was in trouble. In a family way. I'm so sorry. She's a lovely girl. Too lovely, if you ask me. These young ones get ideas in their pretty heads. They haven't yet to taste the bitter dregs of life. They ain't sensible like you and me. We know no one's gonna come and carry US off on a white horse. After my next sermon, I shall present a motion picture of a gigantic steam engine. A motion picture? It's the newest of god's tools for mankind. It's a series of photographs projected sequentially on a wall. The enormous locomotive will appear to get larger and larger until it comes at the viewer. How exciting. I've also arranged a crankie sound recording for a full synchronicity of effect. The thought of it takes my breath away. But, basil, will the churchgoers appreciate it? I am confident that they will recognize the far-sightedness of my most powerful message. And the motion picture will be the greatest religious experience of the 20th century. The motion picture. I'll see you anon. Mr. Elliott, won't you be coming in? My church is outside, Mrs. Anderson. I'll be right over there. All summer, we've been talking about the coming new century, and the marvels it holds in store for US. And I've tried to stay your fears, because you are all so very important to me, so very dear to me. Now it's true, I'm off to the big city, to New York, the new Jerusalem of our age, but you'll always be on my mind and in my prayers. So I leave you with this Do not fear the light of progress! No, no, you don't understand. Please. You have nothing to fear. You have nothing to fear. Someone fetch a doctor. Theo? He suffered a serious concussion, and one leg is broken, that much I can tell you now. Time will answer all other questions. Poor dear. Such a brave man. He's a damn fool to try and play the hero. He's too old for what he tried to accomplish. And now, Alice will have to stay here all the time. Yes, I suppose I will, won't I? Well, he's still unconscious, but I hear he's improving. Then my prayers have been answered. That's kind of you. I feel responsible. Oh, basil, you shouldn't. You tried to show those people a wonderful vision of the future. They weren't ready for it. They were just too frightened. Once before, mankind was not ready for a vision they were shown. I hope you're right. I know I am. It's at times like this that our faith is most needed. Theo. Theo? It just wasn't meant to be, but I'll never forget you. I'm going to go to buffalo for a time, and then I've decided to follow the example of basil march and dedicate my life to god. And then I'm gonna work in the Belgian Congo as a missionary. Perhaps you will. Young girls often change their minds. Good-bye, Alice. Hello. Hello, Theo. Well... I'm afraid I shan't be doing much dancing anymore. I'll have this memento the rest of my natural life. I wanna thank you for coming to the hospital so often. I'm very grateful that you did. You are an old friend, Theo. I suppose you've heard i'm not keeping company any longer with Alice Anderson. Yes. Um, there is very little else newsworthy on the porch these days. Yes, I'm afraid I tire of society around here. You're not thinking of leaving, are you? Yes, I've come to say good-bye. I think I'm best on my own. Yes. It is like that for some people. Tell me something, Christine. Why did... Why did you never marry? I was, um... hurt. Like you, I have no talent for this business. Oh, we could form a parade. A parade of broken hearts. It's good that you can laugh about it. Well, good-bye, Christine. Till we meet again. Till we meet again. ♪ wait till the sun shines, Nellie ♪ Extra, extra, read all about it. Read all about it. ♪ Be happy, Nellie don't you sigh down lovers' Lane we'll wander sweethearts, you and I wait till the sun shines, Nellie by and by ♪ So sad to be leaving before the summer has ended. My dear, summer has ended. I wanna thank the board for inviting me to New York for this meeting. Can we beat the Europeans? The French and the British, they're already there. We can beat them, Mr. Stockton, we beat them in the rockies, we'll beat them in the himalayas. Bully! I'm sold. Good. Tell US, Elliott, this limp. Did you get that fighting the red Indians out west? No, sir. I got this limp fighting for a woman in saratoga Springs. Did you prevail? Fortunately, I did not. She married a preacher. Overcharging me. I won't pay. That's all there is to it. I can no longer extend you any credit. Never been so insulted in my life. Lucie beidermayer? Hello, lucie. I'll pay. But of course, darling, I lost everything. My house, my jewelry, my beautiful gowns. Poor Otto. Suicide. I'm ruined. Desperate. I'm sorry. And what about you? Me? I was desperate once. Ruined by a young woman who I loved a long, long time ago, but inspired me to make a fortune. I just never really enjoyed having it. Oh, silly boy. That's because you never had anyone to share it with. I would have perished if I hadn't discovered laudanum. It's made up of ground-up gold and pearls and opium. Thank god the price of opium has at least stabilized. Is that really well-advised? Oh. Ah! Life is so short. I thought we'd all stay gay and young and rich, like our country. Country is still young, lucie. There are still fortunes to be made by new people with new ideas. Oh! Like Christine Van buren. Now there's one for you. Christine. That damn pottery of hers, it's all the rage. She makes money. The last thing she needs. Christine. I should so like to see her again. You'll find she still hates me. She is jealous of me. She's still jealous that I stole you away from her, and that I could have you back any time I wanted. Eat something. You'll feel better. Waiter. Hello, Christine. Dear Christine. It's good to see you again. It seems it is destiny, always meeting again. Have you come back for the end of the season? No, as a matter of fact, it's business brought me back east this time. I trust all is well. All is well. You, you look... You look lovely. You haven't changed a bit. Well, this time, it's only been five years rather than 25. Yes. So much else seems to have changed. Well, what would life be without change? Seasons. Surprises. Well, this room hasn't changed any. I remember this, that's for sure. Theo, I have begun using darker colors. Colors of the earth, as you once suggested. Colors of the earth. It's beautiful. I love you. I love you, too. Yes, Theo, I do love you. I am sure that I have always loved you. I love you, Christine. I always knew that, one day, I would hear those words. I never knew I would say them. We should be married then. Marry me. Never. Never? Did you suppose that I was merely waiting for that girl to come to her senses, dragging you to yours? That I would always be there waiting for you as I have done before? Oh, god, how much you... How you must despise me to speak of a future, knowing our history. Despise you? Are you mad? I've come here to marry you. You have come too late. How can you say that? You just told me you loved me. Yes, I love you. I blush and burn at the shame of loving you, but I will never marry you. I can at least keep some trace of self-respect. I would like you to go. No, I will not. Then I shall. You think you're blameless in this? You loved me 25 years ago just as you love me at this instant. You could've told me you loved me then. Why did you wait so long? Mr. Elliott. Can it be? Madam Vera. You look like you've seen a ghost. No. It's rather I've become one. Surely you're not going so soon. Yes, there's no point in me staying here. Summer's over and the season's in mist entirely. Not quite, sir. Look at this bush. Yesterday, there was but one sad Rose, now there are more and more blossoms. They're blooming late this year. Mother nature always has surprises. Look around you, Mr. Elliott. ♪ beautiful dreamer wake unto me starlight and dew drops are waiting for thee sounds of the rude world heard in the day lulled by the moonlight have all passed away beautiful dreamer queen of my song hear while I sing their soft melody gone are the cares of life's busy throng beautiful dreamer awake unto me beautiful dreamer awake unto me ♪ ♪ In these bodies our two hearts are beating as one all these years I've been sleeping now life has begun now I find do I pray that you'll stay by my side keep me safe till the darkness subsides like the stars shining down on US here you shine brightly and lighten my spirits, my dear I can barely believe what this heart has begun when you come to me now like a dream 'cause you are the dreamer that came back to me came back to me you are the dreamer that came back to me ♪
