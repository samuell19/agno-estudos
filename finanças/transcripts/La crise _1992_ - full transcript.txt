"THE CRISIS" Marie, it's 7:10, get up. Marie? Marie, it's 7:10, wake up. Marie? Marie? Dad, look what I found on the kitchen table. It's a letter from mom. She says she left. What is this story? Grandma comes to get us at 8:30. I'm going to finish my backpack. - Antoine? - Dad, no milk. - Have you seen mom? - No. Isn't she in the bathroom? Hey, dad? Can you tell Grandma to buy me other boots? These are already very old. - Mom is gone. - Where? I dont know. She has taken all her clothes. Victor? Marie! But what are you doing? Where are you? You are crazy? Leave this way! There is not even milk for the kids. I'm leaving for another. I am not coming back. And? Where is she? I do not know. She says she's with someone else. With whom? What do I know? Another one. Do you mean another man? Leaves you? Is that so? Yes it is. - What?! - Is mom leaving you? It looks like it is. - I forgot the sandwiches at home. - It doesn't matter. It's nothing. Could you take them away? They are going to be ruined. - Yes, but I don't have the key. - Ten days is a long time. But Marie has keys. I give you mine. Take. - Do not worry. Car 3. - Yes, car 3. - Is this. - Come up, honey. - Dad, did you tell grandmother about the boots? - Yes, you need new boots. - I'll pay you. - But no, no! - See you soon, Antoine, see you soon. - See you soon. Do you know why Marie left? Not really. Although past few months... What? I can't hear. - Thérèse ... - There is a letter for you. - Do you know what happened to me? - Yes I know. - And how do you know? - He told me. - Did she tell you? - Who? - My wife. - No why? - Who told you then? - Laurent. Seven out of eight. Are we eight in this situation? - It's really unfortunate. - Laurent? Has she escaped with him? - But who? - My wife. - What do you mean your wife? I do not understand. - What did Laurent tell you? I prefer that you read the letter yourself. It's on your desk. Fuck this! What does it mean? It's your dismissal letter. It is awful. - Laurent, what does this mean? - I'm terribly upset. And how should I be if you are upset? - Let me explain. - I'm really screwed! - Seven out of eight. You are not the only one. - What the hell does that matter to me? The firm is in the restructuring phase. Excuse me a second. Hi? Hi, it's Françoise. This is not the time, I'm in a meeting. But I must speak to you. No. Then I take the sofa with me. Oh no, not the couch. I'm sorry, but it's from my mother. From your mother? Do not tell me! That... You can keep your insults to yourself. Françoise, I'm in a meeting, I hang up. 18 months I have fought like crazy to get ... ... a fundamental case for the study. I did it and made them earn millions. Fifteen days later, they kick me out! How do you explain it? They are afraid that you will become too expensive. And statistics show that cases like that ... They last 20 years, so smart people don't serve us. If I had lost that case, wouldn't they have fired me? Try to think like a manager. Put aside your personal feelings. But what are you saying? How can you expect me to put them aside? Don't be irrational. In my place you would have done the same. But I'm not in your place, I'm in mine! You have seen how I made you calculate the compensation, right? Excuse me for a moment. Hi? How do you allow yourself to hang me? Enough, I'm in a meeting. I'm getting nervous. I called my lawyer over the couch. What does your lawyer have to do with my mother's couch? I'm going to show you how it has to do. I'm in a meeting, I can't ... You can put your compensation wherever you want ! I won't let them treat me like this! Françoise, everything has a limit. Take the sofa, the CDs ... ... the quilt, the copper strainer , I don't give a damn! You understand? Fuck off! She hung up on me. We're going to divorce, for sure! Because I am a good lawyer. And I'm the one who won the case. Even if it costs me a fortune, I'm not going to let them kick me out. I give you some advice. Take the indemnity and go. Don't embark on a lawsuit that will cost you a fortune. - Because if you think that I ... - Excuse me for a second! Françoise, forgive me, I didn't mean to, please excuse me. But you told me to fuck off! Calm down, we talk about it tonight. Don't be angry like that. Françoise? What's up? I still love you, honey. Go to hell. I'm going. - My wife left me. - Yes? What a pig that is Laurent! - Yes! - And I thought it was a friend. - It's crazy ... - Prepare my resume right away. Victor... Research all requests. I have to find a job in 8 days. Victor, I want to tell you ... Then prepare the documentation of the cases I won ... ... and sends them to the competition. - Victor, I must speak to you. - What is it, Thérèse? I can't, because from today I start working. - What does it mean? - I found another job. - Won't you stay with me? - They fired you. What is the problem? We will work elsewhere. But I have the house expenses and my mother lives with us ... ... after my father died and we also want to buy ourselves ... a little house, which is a unique opportunity and then ... ... staying 2 or 3 months without pay, it would be a catastrophe. Two or three months? But no! A lawyer like you will find work without difficulty. But you know how many smart people go months without finding a ... - In which studio are you going to work? - I stay here. - In this office? - No, not exactly in this office. - And where? - Near here. - Where? - With Laurent. - How with Laurent? - His secretary is pregnant. I needed someone, so ... And how long have you known? I see! Very well! Hello Paul? I am Victor. Something awful has happened to me. Or better yet, two frightening things. I have to talk to you, I'm screwed. I can go now? I don't bother you, do I? Good morning, I am a friend of Paul, I have a date with him. - Get comfortable. - Thank you. I do not come to attend to me. I am a friend of Paul. I come to tell you something. Tell him I just arrived. - Yes, of course, I'll tell you right away. -Yes. Hi Martine, two horrible things have happened to me ... I'm very sick, I've come to find Paul to ... - Did you come for allopathy or homeopathy? - Eh? - Where are you calling, Concepcion? - To Paris, ma'am. - Oh yeah? But he speaks in Spanish. - Yes, I'm talking to my cousin who lives in St Denis. Oh yeah? Let's see. Hi? Good morning sir. How are you? Is a man. How is the weather in Malaga today? Oh yeah? Thank God. In Malaga it rains. And how long have you been talking ... ... with the cousin who has the bass voice? He had just called. My mother is very ill and I ... Yes, I know, I know the music. I have a terrifying bill. But I'm already up to the ass of your direct line. Understands? Yes, ma'am, I understand. From now on, I will ask for an itemized invoice ... and I will deduct calls to Spain from your salary. It's okay lady. Do waiting patients come for allopathy or for homeopathy? All for homeopathy, ma'am. Martine, I must talk to you, you don't know what happened to me. Now I understand why I'm up to my ass. I am vulgar. And that? I can not continue like this. Ladies and gentlemen, those of you who are for homeopathy, evacuate immediately .. ... or else, I 'll kick them in the ass. Am I vulgar? Well better! Because my husband is an allopath. They understand? Not a homeopath. Allopath! I come from the bank, we are in red numbers thanks to homeopathy. When I was an allopath I visited 70 people a day. Ten minutes for each. A prescription full of medicines and that's it! 150 francs per person. Do the math. Now go to 10 a day and spend an hour with each client. 10 people instead of 70. Do the math. That is why I have decided, if you want war, you will have it ... ... but with homeopathy it's over. Everyone out at once! Martine, are you crazy? - What I do? Except our marriage. -Paul! We're in the red at the bank and I'm up to my ass with homeopathy Am I vulgar? And that?! How are we going to pay the rent ... ... from the house on the sea and the kids' school? And the phone bill since she always calls Spain? But what's wrong with you? Do I have to worry about immigrants? And the arrangements of the Rambouillet house? Enough, I'm working. And do you call this work? Spending hours chatting with patients ... ... while I fight with the suppliers and the bank. And do you think patients like to wait for you for hours? They are eight and they will not be finished until the evening. Does that amuse you? Before here nobody expected. In 10 minutes it was over. Get out of here immediately. Go shit! Am I vulgar? And that?! As long as I live here, I can speak my mind. That way you don't go anywhere. If you want war, you will have it. Paul, I have spent a moment because they have happened to me ... ... two dreadful things. I need to talk to you. You have not understood anything. I am a doctor, not a money machine. I like to heal people. It makes me happy. I perfectly agree. It is very good to heal people. But heal with homeopathy those you love: the kids, the family, me. But not the others! Business is business! You can't be a philanthropist. This is going to end, isn't it? I couldn't go on like this anymore. He was on the verge of suicide. 70 patients a day. Worse than a suburban whore. All patients to the slaughterhouse. In ten years none of them recovered. In 10 years of allopathy, I have not cured anyone. I have made money, drugged people, increased the health deficit ... ... enriched to the pharmaceutical industry . Do you want me to continue? Do you want me to kill myself? If I must continue like this and if it is better for you, I will commit suicide. I see you want war, so I warn you: .. we have common assets. If I ask for a divorce ... .. I take the boys and half of everything. I leave you with your ass in the air. Do you find me vulgar? And that?! I beg you, listen to me. Homeopathy is the future. All the allopathic colleagues ask me to send them clients. Nobody wants to swallow medicine. I don't have a free shift for the next three months. Do you know the bank's interest rate ? 17%! And they say we are privileged! 20 million at 17%! Paul, I must speak to you. This morning I woke up and she had disappeared. I go to the kitchen and she was gone. Or you swear to me that you will not do any more homeopathy, except in private ... ..or I go and send you my lawyer. You don't want to sell the house because you've decided to cure everyone? I go to the bathroom: she was not there. I open the closet: empty. I've had enough. Do as you see fit. It's your problem, not mine. Next! It's your turn. What I can do? You are my best friend, help me. I will never be able to send him my lawyer. He is so good. Help me, it's so good! And then I find a note where she tells me she's going with someone else. She leaves me. You realize? Victor, don't make her do something stupid, help me. Take her to my sister Sophie, she loves her very much, she will think of something. - I leave you. - Paul, I must talk to you! Do you realize the little scene I did? Customers may not go anymore because of me. But no, but no! How kind you are. Good thing we still have friends like you. Stop! I have seen something in a shop window that I was looking for months ago. I'll be right back! Yes. I don't have medicine for my nose but I can auscultate you. But what is auscultation? - Come on, guys, we're going. - Yes mom. Will you open, Hélène? Mom, it's Aunt Martine with a man. Hi Sophie, look. It is the same as the carpet that was stolen from us. Do you remember the kilim that was at Rambouillet's house? Oh Nice. This is Victor. A friend of Paul. - Hello Victor. - Hi. I'm depressed. We are very bad with Paul. We're in red numbers at the bank and homeopathy has ruined us. Sorry, but we're late, we have to go to the station. Hélène, go open fast. - I better go. - I know how you feel, you are like me. It's Pierre, with Gaspard and Sylvain. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - What are you doing here? - I brought you the kids. We were supposed to meet at the station. - Bernard made me tell the boys to come here. -How? - Hello, Pierre. - Hi. This is Victor, a friend of Paul's. Yes, hello. You loan him the game. Yes? - Yes, okay. - I have to go. I'm sorry. Yes, see you later, I'm leaving. - Goodbye dad! - Lend him the game. Okay, okay. Pierre is Sophie's ex-husband, and Gaspard is the son she has had ... ... with Sylvie, his second wife. And Sophie has had Hélène and Nico with Bernard, her second husband. Oh, I understand. Mom, I lost the math book . And Sylvain is the son of both. - Whose? - From Pierre and Sophie. Ah yes yes. - Look, you're going to do Math anyway. Hélène, open. Mom, it's Alain and Marie. - Hello Marie. - Hi. Hi Alain, this is Victor, a friend of Paul's. - Hi. - Hi. Hi Alain, but aren't you bringing Claudine and Richard? No, Marianne had to bring them. - Where? - Here. But shouldn't we meet at the station? ¡Oh, no, no! Oh God, I don't understand anything anymore. Alain is the husband of Marianne, Bernard's first wife ... ... Sophie's husband, and Marie is their daughter. So she is the stepsister of Marianne and Bernard's children. No? Yes of course? They are a bag of stepbrothers and stepsisters ... ... and they always go on vacation together. Nice right? -Clear. Hélène, open. Why always me? - Sylvain, you open it then. - How annoying you are. No, you are! Who? - It's Marianne with Claudine and Richard. - Hello everyone. Hi Sophie, don't bother. I leave you the kids, goodbye. Bye, I'm so late! Yes me too. Marianne, this is Victor, a friend of Paul's. - Hi. - Hi. - Come on, Alain, I'm double queuing. - Sophie, I'm going with Marianne. Bye. - Goodbye dad. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye, be good. Quick, come on. Alain married again, to Marianne, Claudine's mother and Richard ... ... that she had with Bernard. Nice family, huh? Yes, but how come they all got divorced ? I do not understand. - I'm going! - It sure is dad. Shit. Hi Sylvie. This is Victor, a friend of Paul's. - Ah, hello. - Hi ... Sophie, I brought you Sylvain's math book . I found it in the garbage can. Congratulations, nice try. - Shit. - Hello dear. - Hi Mom. Ah, thank you very much! I'm leaving, bye. Bye! We need to talk about the math book in the trash. Mom, it's not my fault. Now I don't have time, but we'll talk about it later! - Hi, Bernard. - Ah, Martine, how are you? Too bad, I had a fight with Paul; homeopathy destroys ... ...our marriage. Look, it 's like the one they stole from us. - Do you remember the kilim from the house ... - Excuse me. Sophie! - Who took the medications? - I put them in my backpack. Are you here, Bernard? How come the boys are here? Didn't we have to meet on the platform? I believed that too, but they have been brought here. Pierre told me ... - Everyone in our house? - Yes, all seven. - Why did you put them in the backpack? - I was playing doctor. Bernard, I don't know if you know Victor, a friend of Paul's. - Bernard is Sophie's husband. - Hi. Oh yes, you deal with corporate law. Yes, that's right, something very crazy has happened to me . I won the study a very important case recently so ... - Dad, do you have the tickets? - I? No, Marianne has them. No, I have them. Well that's what I think. ... for a job that worked, because I clarify ... Shit! I can't find the tickets. No, Sophie, don't tell me you've lost them. The boys come early, with the skis and everything else. Don't bother me, I'm looking for them. I never said I don't have them, I look for them, which is different. But you said you couldn't find them. - Do not make me nervous. - You make me nervous. It is always like that. Look what a mess when you organize something! Don't talk to me like that, please! But the facts speak for themselves. We're supposed to meet at the station ... After ... everyone here. We will need at least four taxis. But I didn't book them, because you didn't tell me anything. - And now, you lose the tickets. - Let's go by subway. - Yes, by subway! No one told me that Claudine and Richard slept at Marianne's house. .. and also you lose almost 6000 francs of tickets. I warn you, going on holidays in these conditions, no! I can not stand it anymore. Enough, enough, enough! If you like organization, organize it yourself for this family. Organize the trip yourself. It's easy to criticize. ... when you do nothing. What do I do nothing? I went to get money to the bank? Who packed the suitcases, skis, anoraks and sweaters? Who caught four washing machines to dry and iron? Who thought of the holiday chores, the supplies... ... defrost the fridge, throw out the garbage ... .. in the first aid kit? Hélène, I forbid you to play ... ... with the medicine bag! - Here it is, mom! I'm tired, go without me, I stay here. Well, what have you got? What did i say What is all this hysteria? If you say the word 'hysteria' one more time, I'll strangle you! Dad, we wanted to sleep at Marianne's house ... .. it's not Sophie's fault. You always accuse Sophie and the others. That's why mom divorced you. Well, I have seen that the whole family is against me, all right. I'll stay, go. - Dad, you have to call the taxis. - Shut up, I know what I'm doing. Don't fight, I beg you, it's horrible, I can't stand it. My wife left me this morning and I am desperate. You who are a destroyed family , broken by divorces ... ... with children sent back and forth ... ... you should get along. Think about what awaits them ... ... to my children, it's terrible. Like my dismissal letter. It was a shock! What does it say, Victor? Are you delirious? How do you allow yourself to criticize us? Our family works well. Clear. How can you tell the children are back and forth? - What do you mean back and forth? - I want to be back and forth. I do not criticize them, I pity them. My wife has left me. But you should feel sorry for yourself, not us. We are very well and we are happy. So we're not going on vacation? Victor is only worried because of his wife. Although for me it is the same. I'm terrified of the idea that ... Because I really love Paul, but it's homeopathy that ... Mom! The tickets were in the math book. Do not tell me! Thanks you are very good! Here are the tickets! Goodness. I did not wait something less. Up, we go! - Can I stop math now that I found the tickets? -No! - Mom, can you give me back the medicines? - No, you don't play with medicine! Bring your skis, quickly. Look out, I'm sorry, but I must close the door. Sure, sorry. We leave you, we are in a hurry. Goodbye, Martine. No, I'm going to the station with you. I have to talk to someone. Goodbye, Victor. Wait, I misunderstood. I did not explain myself well. I find you all very nice and your family works. How? I don't understand why she left me. I wish I could understand. Instead, I would try to understand how she managed to stay with you. - What did you say your name was? - Victor. I really like you, Victor. Come on, boss, another round. - Women are bitches. - All whores. - No, not mine. - Oh, not yours? Mine will return with the tail between the legs. Like those assholes of Laurent and Thérèse. They are two assholes, but I will fight. To the health of Thérèse who will return with her tail between her legs. No, she's my secretary, she betrayed me. She too? How unfortunate! And Laurent is a real shit. He could have left his wife alone, Laurent, couldn't he? You don't understand. Laurent is not my wife's lover. He's the chief of staff. He was the one who fired me. Don't swell my balls. Sorry, I hadn't understood that you had also been fired. What does it matter to you? What do you find strange? No, I don't find anything strange. Really, I swear. So, another round? I am alone in the world, nobody loves me. Gross. - Behave well. - Yes, don't worry about me. Because she is a very good girl, my wife's best friend ... ... from a very rich family. You do not need to warm up. I see that with such stairs ... - What? - What kind of family it is. - What did you say your name was? - Michou. - A very stupid name. - I know, I was already told. Ah, is it you? Hello Tania, I came because Marie ... Sorry. Hello Madam. Ignore him, I just met him, his name is Michou. Good morning, Madam. I would like you to help me find Marie since ... Are you crying? Something terrible has happened to me. - Fuck, what? - Come to see. Look. It's your violin. It exploded in my hands yesterday afternoon. I was working for a concert two days from now. I do not know what happened. Suddenly, everything broke. Maybe the wood was dry. The trio, the students ... And wow, everything was broken. The strings on one side ... .. the mango, on the other; splinters everywhere. The luthier will come from one moment to another. I'm screwed I have a concert in two days. And pop, everything was broken. It's almost unbelievable, all of a sudden. I was studying a piece for the trio ... ... and wow, everything broke. You should have seen it. He had the bow in one hand, the handle in the other. ... and the body of the violin hanging from the strings. Can't you use another one? As another? Do you know what these violins cost ? Look for a cheaper one. But you don't change a violin just like that. It takes months to get used to. I won't be able to be at the concert on Tuesday ... The luthier! That violin is a good mess. Like my wife: paf, she left. Suddenly. But at least with your wife you can discuss, try to do it ... return with the tail between the legs. No? Yes of course. I was studying and pop, everything broke. I have a concert in two days. I'm in trouble... .. if the violin can't be fixed. Then I go, I see that you are busy. Yes, bye. By the way, don't you know where Marie is? - Marie? - She, paf, suddenly left. She is your best friend. Does this make you laugh? Are you kidding me? Not at all, it's Michou. Finish laughing now! I don't know where Marie is, but if I did ... .. you would be the last person I would tell. If she left you, she has done very well ... .. because you are a selfish prick and you don't even deserve the children ... .. nor the woman you have. I hope you lean your head against the wall .. .. like an idiot, when you understand everything you've lost. I also lost my job. You're not very kind to ... I salute you. The door is over there. Paf! everything broke. I had the bow in one hand ... .. the handle on the other and the body of the violin hanging from the strings. - Would you like a beer? - No. What a shame, because it raises morale. Leave me alone. It's not good what she told him. You lost everything ... .. and it hurts to be told: selfish prick. She did not go soft on you. But surely she didn't really think so. She was nervous about the violin. You too, laugh like an idiot! It's your fault, because of how stupid you are! Excuse me, but the story of the violin made me die laughing. I couldn't abstrain. But why do you follow me like a dog? What do you want? Maybe a good beer would make you less aggressive. Goodbye, Michou. - Goodbye. Don't need anything? - No, nothing. I just need to get into bed. Because if you need something, I'll bring it to you. Don't worry, I can do it. I just need you to disappear. You understand? Air! Bye. Well, bye. - Victor? - Françoise? What are you doing here? I've been waiting for you for two hours. I heard about your dismissal. It's awful. I had recently won a vital case for the study. That bastard Laurent! You know we are in the middle of a divorce, right? No, i did not know. I can not believe it. Thank you for coming to cheer me up. Marie left this morning. There wasn't even milk left. You must do me a great favor. Sign this letter. - What letter? -You don't know the things I have to endure. Laurent is a monster. For example, the leather sofa... He says it's from his mother. Lie! I bought it with the sales catalog. - The what? - The sofa. Ah yes, the sofa. In this letter, you say that he is sleeping with your secretary. - Is Laurent sleeping with Thérèse? - What do I know! But from that bastard I want the maximum amount of alimony. - Do you know that Marie abandoned me? This morning. -No! - Forever? - Yes, with another man, I think. - And who is it? - I dont know. What if we write that Laurent is sleeping with Marie? - Is Laurent sleeping with Marie? - What do I know? Françoise, I'm very sad, I need to talk to someone. My purpose is to torment Laurent until he dies. When I try to tell my story, nobody cares. - The what? - My problems. Why? You have problems? Stay to sleep, I feel so lonely. - What? - I'm afraid of sleeping alone. I can not believe it. Men are all the same. I come to ask you to help me, I am suffering a terrible divorce ... .. and you want to take me to bed? But no, I'm not even going to touch you, it's just so we can be together. I know the music. Like good friends, right? Victor, you really disappoint me. I expected something else from you. - It's not what you think. You did not understand. - I understood perfectly. I'm going. ¡Françoise! Mr. Victor, Mr. Victor! Shit! He is not answering. - Do you know Victor? - Yes a little bit. Who? I am Michou. Don't you want a beer? Fuck off! - Well OK. - Victor is not your friend, then. Not exactly, no. - Wants a beer? - How can you say no? Yes! - Do you know him well? - Not really. I can't stand him. Sometimes I don't tolerate him either, but little. Hi Mom? It's Victor, how are you? Yeah all right. No, not at all, I'm going to see you. I'm on the 11 o'clock train. I swear, it is something I would like very much! - Eh, Michou? - Good morning, Victor. - But what are you doing here? - Can't you see it? We speak. - Do you know each other? - Since last night, yes. - And have you spent the night together? - Can't you see it? Yes. Fuck! Be good, my mother is a good old-fashioned woman. Don't ask her for beer, she hates alcohol, you must be polite. Mr. Victor, I appreciate it so much. Enough calling me Mr. Victor, it pisses me off a lot. Excuse me, Mr. Vic - No, I mean Victor. We get acquainted. It's okay? And do not worry. I will be good. You have been very kind to invite me. I don't invite you home at my mother's, I drag you home to my mother's ... ... because you're clingy, I feel sorry for you and I'm weak. - But if you start laughing ... - No, I'm not going to laugh , I swear. Are we taking some beers and sandwiches for the trip? There! Did you really spend the night together? - Yes! - In bed together? No, because I don't have a home and she was worried ... ... about the marital home. So we stay at the bar. You are an amazing guy. But how come you don't have a home? Because my brother's wife is sick. Oh yeah? And so? When I lost my job 3 year ago, I went to live with my brother. His son had recently died from a motorcycle accident. Now his wife has cancer ... ... and the hospital sent her home because she is in terminal phase ... ... then I had to give him back the room. My brother hopes they give him an allowance. Money comes in handy. How terrible! But what are you trying to do? That I feel sorry? You're a pain. But no, I don't expect that at all. You ask and I answer. I don't want to embarrass you. I don't care about these things. I'm happy! Did Françoise tell you why she is divorcing Laurent? She just told me she can't stand him anymore. It's crazy, right? It takes little for people to separate. This did not happen before. The couples stayed together ... ... they learned to put up with each other, they really loved each other. My parents, for example, are a wonderful couple. They never fight, they are happy, they grow old together, calm ... ... in his little house. It really is wonderful. - Hello, Mr. Borin! - Hi. - All good? - Yes, good. Well. Here you are. Have you come to pay your parents a visit? - Yes. Well, see you later. - Well bye. He teaches yoga here. He is very nice. - You know everyone here, huh? -Yes. Look, there is my little sister. Hello Dad. Hi Isa. Hi Mom. I just met Mr. Borin, always tanned and fit. - He's out? - Yes, he's outside. That's Michou, a friend who ... Good morning, ma'am, good morning, sir, good morning, miss. - Victor, we need to talk. - What? Some matters to be resolved. In family. It's okay. Michou, would you mind going out, please? Hey? Oh yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stepping out Go have a chat with Mr. Borin, he's very nice. Yes, I'm going, excuse me. I don't want to disturb. He's a poor guy that I picked up. He follows me like a dog. Mom, don't you know what happened to me? Marie has left me. I am depressed and I do not understand at all what is happening. And besides, they fired me from work the same day. - Victor, your mother has a lover. - What? She has decided to leave me to go with him. At 50 she's running with someone 10 years younger than her. - So is. - And dad is left alone. - And who is he? - Mr. Borin. - Mr. Borin? - Married. Two children. Mr. Borin, the one out there? - What a son of a bitch! - Don't tell me. Mom, have you gone crazy? And where will you go? And dad? And me? I have problems. Marie has left me ... ... I have lost my job, I'm completely... Victor, enough. Be quiet and listen to me. Your problems with work, with your wife, with money ... ... in general and in particular ... ... I, your mother, don't give a damn about them. Is the concept clear to you? That's right, I don't care about them. You can't tell how much I don't care about them. I don't give a damn about them. But it is unbelievable! Doesn't my mother care about my problems? And I tell you more: Not only I don't care about your problems ... ... but also your sister's problems. I absolutely don't care about them. And now for the fun! I don't care about your father's problems at all. I'm dreaming. I swear. I'm dreaming? You are not dreaming. For 30 years I have washed you, fed you, laid you down, raised you ... ... consoled all three, I ironed your shirts ... ... wash your underwear, take care of your studies ... ... I've ruined my health. I have lived only for you, ... through you. I have heard all your stories, anguish, problems ... ... without ever giving you the pain of mine. So now I retire. You still have a long life. ... to solve your crisis, I have little time left ... .. to solve mine, that's why, for once ... .. I will take care of my affairs, before yours. You are going to destroy two families for a vulgar story of sex. Ah, right! Your sex stories are love ... ... but mine is vulgar. Right? Yes, it is vulgar; It's disgusting. But it is a whim. He is 10 years younger than you. It cannot last. It will last, as long as it has to last; I do not care. Even if it lasts an hour, I'll do all the same. Also, I don't think duration is good ... ... to love stories. It is not a love story, you are only interested in getting laid. Of course I'm interested. Are you not interested? And even though it was only a sex story, Am I not allowed to have one? You're crazy. How do you think you two came to the world? I did not make you with my ears, it was fucking, dear. It was pleasant, at that time, to fuck with your father. Now nothing happens. So you might not like hearing it... ... but your mother in bed works very well. It works better than ever. Do you know And there is another thing ... ... that you won't be able to understand: I'm in love ... I'm happy... I sail in happiness. With his mother? Damn it! You can't imagine. She is beautiful, funny ... ... we have fun as two kids. we go to the mountain... ... to the restaurant, we bought bicycles, we go on a picnic, she's like a volcano. - I'm reborn. - Yes, but she's past fifty. And I am forty. With my wife, nothing has happened in bed for years. Like two pieces of marble. I've been with many girls ... tsz tsz tsz tsz, hysterical ... ... you never know if they climax. But she ... she ... - Pam! - Really "pam"? Hey yeah, she got under my skin, I don't know how to put it. Shit! My wife is coming. I was sure to find you here. Josiane, calm down. - She's here? -Yes. I'm going to talk to her. Come on, kids. Josiane, don't be silly. And are you the one who tells me? Now it's hot! Hi Josiane, there's coffee in the kitchen. Hello kids. I took out Victor and Isa's toy box. For you. - Ready, let's go. - Goodbye. - Are you going with him? - Yes, I'm going with him. Sorry, but there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Mom, an Indian costume! Don't cry, Josiane. Give me the feathers, I saw them first! It is awful! Stay over here, I can't let you go like this. The kids can sleep in Victor's and Isa's rooms. Yes, willingly, thank you. I might even be foolish tonight. Kill myself! No, you have to be strong, Josiane. I will help you. Dad ... since you have company, I'll leave you. Yes, very good, and thank you for coming, Victor. See you soon, son. Goodbye, Isa dear. Goodbye, dad, I'll leave you with Josiane, I'll call you. Goodbye ma'am, goodbye sir, good evening. And luck. I think I'm going to go to Africa or India. Why? I would like to become useful with "Doctors without borders". It's too depressing here. - Are you a doctor? - No, I have an Ad agency. Ah. And that would be useful for Africans, do you think? No, but it would do me good to change the air. Oh, sure. You saw how she admitted not caring about us. It's a shame that someone doesn't care about our problems. I'm Laville's guest tonight. Are you coming? The deputy? Is he a socialist or a neo-Gaullist? Socialist and needs a publicity campaign. - Can I invite myself? - I'll call him. One of the biggest problems France will face ... ... of course, it will be how to improve the image of the political class ... ... in front of the French people. Hence the need for communications. That is why advertising and the media are indispensable. Absolutely. - I'm going to get the canapes. - I'll help her. Right now, we grope in total darkness. And then there is the problem of racism. How to eradicate this scourge? I have confidence in the French people. He is tolerant and generous. More than 15% of the votes for the extreme right is not small. - Yes, it's terrible. - It's a shame. It's a real shame. Don't bother, Isa. - You don't have the Moroccan anymore? - No, for a long time. I have a Filipina. - Oh yeah? And is it good? - It's formidable. Asian women are the best: serious, clean, discreet, hardworking ... Although the Portuguese are also very clean, but thieves. Maghreb women are very good with children, but they don't know how to clean. And black women, for their part, are always tired. No, but with the Asians, so good. I can give you the address of an excellent agency. Oh yeah? Please. Thank you. Trusting is good, but not trusting is better. Do you have everything? Yes, I have the foie gras, the ribs and the coffee. Me, the desserts, the spirits and the wines. - Has anyone seen you? - No. �Joder! And here we have Olivier and Sarah ... - And what interests you in life? - The ecology. Also dietetics. We have read all about diet. Don't overdo it, you have read some books on diet. No, Mom, I've read everything. Everything. - True passionate. - Do you know Dr. Kusmine? - No. - A true genius. - And the macrobiotic? - Yes, something. - What does it say exactly? - That we eat shit. - Let him come in. - No. You can't leave that boy in the street. - Yes, no problem. - But how ...? - It really is very nice of you. Can I get him? - Yes. - Clear. You see, he's a good boy. A bit silly, but good. Deep France ... - What is the problem? Let's get closer to deep France. Michou? Michou? Michou! You can come, they invite you to dinner. How nice, but I'm fine, don't worry, Mr. Victor. Enough with that "Mr. Victor" thing, I already told you. Okay but I'm staying here, no problem. Come here. But be nice. And you, Michou, what do you think? It is much easier to be against racism when you live here ... ... than when you live in Saint Denis. I'm from Saint Denis and I'm a racist. You, on the other hand, live in this house and are not racist at all. Frankly, Michou, do you consider yourself a racist? Frankly yes. I can't stand the foreigners who live next door. They don't do anything, they're dirty, they steal cars ... ... they give them a house before the French. With all the subsidies they earn more than us. At school our children don't learn anything ... ... because they are surrounded by foreigners who do not speak French. Then there is the veil, and on top of that we have to pay for the mosques ... Everything has a limit. But they do not have the right to diversity, to tolerance ... ... to the ideals of France, land of asylum? I know. I don't know anything. But it is horrible to be a racist, it is immoral. Yes, but one cannot change. So you would vote for Le Pen? No, I can't vote, I don't have an address. It's been 5 years since my brother asked for a three-bedroom flat ... ... but since the son killed himself with the motorcycle, they did not give it to him. That is why I do not have a fixed address. Because his wife has cancer ... .. and from the hospital they sent her home because she is in the terminal phase. Yes, that's fine, but if you voted, would you vote for Le Pen? All the Arabs I know are in a five or six bedroom. That is why they have so many children. What you don't understand is that your problems will not be solved with racism. Yes, but I understand that three-quarters of the planet is in shit. So they seek to settle here, where there is less shit. So, once here, you have to squeeze in to make room for them. .. and that they can survive. It's obvious. - Its what I say. But those of us who are tight are those of St Denis .. ... not the ones from here. So we have to squeeze .. and keep smiling, because otherwise it's immoral. Won't you be a bit of a communist? No! I am not a communist, otherwise I would have had the house a long time ago. And so is my brother. Then hurry up to get the party card ... ... before it disappears completely. I already tried a couple of times ... .. but they always rejected me because I did not follow the line ... .. he made many zigzags and to have a house ... .. it is necessary to show that the line is followed, but I am an idiot. But no, but no! We can go to the table. Victor, how's business going? They were doing well until Friday. I won an important case ... .. for the studio I work for, well, I worked. Because, precisely ... .. it's amazing, I have struggled 18 months to build .. a vital case for study ... I get up, go to the bathroom, and she was gone. I open the closet ... I don't know if your personal problems might be of interest. No issue Isa. How do I let go of my personal feelings? That asshole of Laurent and Therese ... - Have you seen the Marchellier campaign? -Yes, of course. If I had lost the case, I would not have been fired. Darling! Darling! - Yes? - I beg your pardon, Victor. I don't know how, but dinner is gone. How disappeared? There is nothing. The foie gras, the meat, the dessert, the wines. Everything! - What do you say? - But it is not possible. Come see. - Sorry. - No Please. What do you have in your pocket? - Me? Nothing. - What are you hiding with your hand? But nothing, nothing at all. What is this? It's disgusting. Cake? Did you go to steal cake? No, not at all... We will have to be content with eating pastas. Our food has disappeared. The thief must have passed ... ... through the door leading to the garden. and took, absolutely everything. - But it is not possible. - What an outrage! I beg your pardon, I am going to help my wife. You are a pig! I can't take you anymore! And besides, you're a fucking racist! What a shame! It's not my fault, it wasn't me. You smell like wine, you stole the wine too. You disgusting idiot! Mr. Victor, I swear, I found everything in the trash. And don't call me "Mister Victor", I can't stand it. Okay! From now on... It's ready! It's ready! I hope you're not too hungry. No, not much... Thank you very much, ma'am. As soon as we go out, I'm going to break your face in such a way ... ... that not even your mother won't recognize you. My mother is also a bit ... - Dad and mom aren't here? - No, they're in the kitchen. The spaghetti is ready. I don't know how it could have happened ... What's in that pot, Olivier? Brown rice, we're sick of your shitty food. From now on, as soon as we see unhealthy food in here ... ... we will throw it away. But are you crazy? Did you steal the food? We didn't steal it, we we threw it away. Have you thrown all the food in the trash? We have thrown away the foie gras ... .. because it is toxic and is from a tortured animal. The rib because beefs are stuffed with antibiotics, hormones ... .. and chemicals. Alcohol, because we can't take it anymore that after dinner where everybody talk nonsense and drive drunk. And cake because they are full of sugar, fat and microbes. And because they are a factory of cavities. If you want to die at 50 years of multiple sclerosis, of cancer ... ... or a heart attack, we don't care, but we won't eat something like that anymore ... .. because we don't want to live like sick beasts. We want a long and healthy life. They completely lost their mind! Olivier, try to reason. I am a deputy for an agricultural area ... ... imagine what would happen if the right-wing press knew ... .. that in my house veal, foie gras, wines are thrown away .. Why do you like being a deputy so much? To do something useful .. ... or to get your hands dirty and benefit from it? Be careful with what you say. You are more concerned with the right-wing press than the health of your own children. - What if he was not re-elected? - What do we care! Don't you wonder why the earth is a garbage dump? Why do people get sick younger and younger? No, you don't care: it only counts that you are reelected. You are an idealist and that is fine, but there are economic realities. ... behind the pollution. The breeders, the competition ... So what? We have to get intoxicated to allow ... .. that the breeders make money with the health of the people? And above all, get them to vote for you? What cretins farmers ... ... with your fucking meat! And when people understand .. .. that meat hurts and stop buying it .. .. breeders will stop raising and cultivating cereals. And even if you are not reelected, at least you will be interested. ... for the good of the people and not just for your well-being. - I'm devastated, excuse us! - Good! We have all enjoyed your ecological speech .. ... but now we would like to have dinner. No? No, because we just threw the spaghetti in the trash. - Go immediately to your room. - Fuck you, you old idiot! - Apologize immediately ! - Excuses, my ass! Enough! To your room! Do you know what you look like when you speak in that tone? A fascist. You have the fair face of a fascist. - You fucking brat! - Useless! Fascist! - I think we'd better go. - Yes, I think it's better. - I'm so sorry. - Yes, we understand. - Isa, don't talk about this with anyone. - Don't worry, i won't. - Goodbye, sir, I forgot your name... - Michou, and thanks for the food. That is, because of the food that you prepared and that we did not eat. Let's go! - Bye, see you soon. - Yes, see you soon. - I'm starving. - And I, don't tell me... - Now everything is closed. - At home I have nothing. - On the other hand, you, Michou ... - My belly hurts a little. You deserve it. But why? You saw that I did not steal the food. Those kids are crazy. But is it true what they said about the foie gras, the meat, the cakes...? - Yes, it's very true. - Shit! My belly hurts! I feel very bad. Is it cancer? - I let you make the bed? - Yes, very kind, thank you. - Where is the bathroom? - Down the hall. - Do you fell nauseous? - Not at all. - The carpet is new here. - Oh yeah. Nice carpet. Do you want a bucket near the bed? No, if you leave the hallway lit, I can get to the bathroom. Your friend is starting to get on mt nerves. - Me too. - But why are you dragging him with you? Tomorrow I kick him out. - Does it bother you to sleep here? - It's not like before. - What is it? - Shit! It's Didier's voice. - Didier? - My fiance. - Your fiancé? - Well, my boyfriend. Isa, it's me! - And what does he want at this hour? - Let me see. Isa! - What are you doing here? - I bring all my things. I'm tired of sleeping alone, I come to stay. - Stay where? - In your flat. It's three in the morning. Don't worry, go back to bed, I'll bring everything in... ... and tomorrow I'll settle. - What is wrong with you? I've been selfish, I wanted my freedom too much. .. and I never proposed to you to get married and to live together ... .. but tonight I made up my mind, I have understood that I really love you .. .. and that I can't live without you. I take the big leap. What big leap? Did you lose your mind? - How did I 'lose my mind'? - I do not want you to settle in my flat. How... you don't feel like it? No, and there is no room. - You don't love me anymore? - I love you very much. - But this doesn't mean that ... - You want us to get married? - No, we are not getting married and I don't feel like it. - What do you not feel like? Everything and nothing. For example, that you are hungry when I am on a diet. That you shave for hours and never clean the sink. I don't have room for a bigger washing machine. Your friend Stephane is a jerk and I don't want him coming to my house ... ... to watch football and eat peanuts. And a thousand other things. - You don't like my friends? - Stephane, not at all. If you loved me, you would like them. I love you, but I don't like Stephane at all. Also, I have a new library and there is no room for your things ... ... so you're not going to put ... - You are a great egoist! - Where do you think you are? What do you mean? You come to hit me at three in the morning! I came to ask you to get married and you say that I came to hit you? I don't want to live with anyone. Neither with you nor with anyone else. I want to live alone, alone. I want to fart whenever ... ... come back any time I want, eat where I want ... ... invite friends, clean the house once a year if I feel like it. Spend my money as I feel. But you can do that, I don't see what the problem is. The problem is, I don't want a man bent over on the couch asking, "What's for dinner tonight?" I don't want to be told: "Iron, you do it very well." I don't want to buy the newest BMW for which we will pay the installments together. I don't want your mother to call me to ask if you took your medicine. I don't want your dirty socks in the laundry. I don't want to clean the kitchen the day you decide ... ...to prepare a paella for your office colleagues. I don't want to ask you if you want to watch a movie instead of sports. I don't want! I don't want! Your life is your life, and my life is my life. So you want to be able to fuck whenever you want and with whoever. - You tire me. - You have somebody else? Listen, Didier, I love you very much, but we're fine like this. See each other from time to time, and each one at home. - I'm sure you have somebody else. - There is no other. - Then I stay to sleep. - No, not tonight. Why not tonight? Why yesterday night but not tonight? - Because tonight I don't feel like it. - There's another one in here. - Didier, you're such a pain. - I want to be sure. If you take one more step, everything is over between us. - I knew you were with someone else! - He's my brother. I introduce myself: Victor, Isa's brother. You're such a whore! Just when I come to propose to you. - He's my brother! - Yes, yes! Your brother naked, in your bed and I have to believe you! He's not naked and he's my brother! He's my brother! Sorry, but I didn't have time to get to the bathroom. And who is this? Your little sister perhaps? - That's Michou... - I tried as fast as I could but... - It is an orgy! - Fuch off! Asshole! Fuch off! Do you have a mop...? Here is the train ticket and money for the bus. It leaves in an hour in front of the church. - Well, okay. - Ready. - Then bye. - Bye, Michou. All right, so the bus leaves in an hour. You must punch the ticket at the station. - Yes, yes ... punch it. - Good. I'm going to the mountains with Isa. No, that's enough now, you follow me like a dog and I don't know why. And you do nothing but bullshit. Why do you follow me like this? Do you know at least why? - Huh? - Why do you follow me like this? Answer frankly. - Yes. - No, no lies, honestly. If I were a loser like you, if I didn't pay for the beers, the sandwiches ... ... if you didn't expect to take a little money from me every day ... ... frankly, would you follow me just because of my friendship? For myself alone, because it's me, Victor? - Frankly ... - Yes, seriously, no bragging. - Frankly, then... - Yes. If you were a loser like me, if you didn't pay me for the beers, the sandwiches ... ... if I didn't expect to take a little money from you every day ... ... frankly, I would never follow you. - Oh, no? - No, frankly not. - Not even for friendship? - No, excuse me, frankly not. Not even because you like me and you feel good with me? - No, not at all, frankly. - Really, you disgust me. You can't even imagine how much you disgust me, Michou. Why? I didn't lie, I answered frankly. Nobody loves me! Nobody cares about my problems... ... everyone is so selfish. It's disgusting. If you want, I can carry the backpack. Enough, you would not do it to help me, but because you know ... ... that inside there is some food inside. I swear, I want to carry it to help you. Really. I want to climb the mountain with you! I warn you, that mountain is really hard. But I am really fit. I give you back the train ticket. - And won't you give me back the money? - Oh yeah. Take. So are we going to the mountains? Isa, hurry up, or we'll miss the sunrise! I'm coming! I'm cleaning the carpet. How good is this! But short of breath. Yes, you need to be in shape. At 13, you were running to the top. What a view! What a beauty! What a shit tiring! We were missing the mountain they said! We are at the top! What a view! I am the king of the world! I can't take it anymore! Where are those assholes ? And I'm the one carrying the food. I'm such an ass. Where do those two want to go? But what weariness! Wow, it's so high! Fuck! Drink less beer. Here is the food. So heavy! There is nothing for you, Michou. After your indigestion last night .. ... a little diet won't hurt. - Sure, a little diet. - Yes, a little diet. You haven't even looked at the landscape. You see how beautiful? - But what happens Michou? - Nothing... nothing... - Are you crying? - No, no, it's gonna pass... - Is it the diet that makes you cry? - No, the landscape. It makes me think of my brother's wife. I would like to see her. - Where are you going? - To see my brother's wife. - You can stay at my place if you want. - She's dying. - Here, take a hundred francs. - You can stick them up your ass, Mr Victor. - Have I offended you? - No, I'm sad. For leaving me? You need me more than I need you, but you're too stupid to see it. Give me your brother's address. You already know mine. Take! Did you already have it ready? Hello Victor. Hello, Bebert. What the hell happened to you? - Are you talking about my head? - Did you fight? No, it's the surgeon who ruined me. Yeah... he really ruined you. - I'm so pissed! - I can see... I had a hair transplant, but it went wrong. They look like brush bristles, they grow everywhere. So I have done the "Lombroso" technique is called. They are bags filled with physiological saline. It hurts a lot! - I'm in such a pain! - And are you going to be okay with that? - Yeah, I guess, but it's not sure. - And is it expensive? And yes, I asked for a loan from the bank too, because afterwards ... .. I do a filling. - What is a filling? They take fat from your stomach and inject it into your wrinkles. - Great thing, you'll see. - But you don't have many wrinkles. Of course I have. And medicine has made so much progress... .. to be taken advantage of. - And you took advantage. We can't miss it. Doctors also take advantage, you mean. I didn't mean that. And how are you doing? I have lost my job and my wife has left me. - But you're not bald! - No, not that. - Have you seen the fat I have? - No, where? If it doesn't go away in a week, I also have liposuction. A liposuction? They suck the fat out from under your skin. - With a pump. - You're so brave. You want it then you get it. I don't let myself be, no! - You think I let myself be? - You? - Do I have a lot of wrinkles? - No'that's fine. Are you afraid of death? When I'm perfect, I'll find someone who loves me. You'll see! You don't have anyone who loves you? - Do you know what medicine is like in China? - No. Four times a year, the whole family goes to the doctor. The guy checks them, to look in the healthy ones for weak points that could .. become a disease. He does a little acupuncture ... .. gives them herbs, corrects the diet, rebalances the body. Then they pay him, and they leave. For them, this is medicine. Prevent one from getting sick. So if anyone gets sick ... .. the doctor visits them and for that visit, they do not pay him. Because this is not medicine for them. Curing a disease when it's already there... .. is like making weapons after declaring war... Or dig a well when you're thirsty. You have to think about it before. That's why healthy people are good for a Chinese doctor ... .. because the healthy pay. Sick people waste his time. .. and they do not give profits. If a doctor has too many patients ... .. the guy is ruined and also people say he is not good and will not opt for him. Here, it's the opposite. The more patients he has... .. The more respect he has and more money he earns. I sit in quicksand, I look in the mirror and I say to myself: .. "Can anyone love me?" What makes 2 people stay together? Why did I choose her and not another one? What did she love in me ... ... but no longer loves? Do I still love her ? What does it mean to love after 10 years when they see each other ... .. every morning with a wrinkled face? How long does the desire to fuck last? It is said nine months, two years, but everyone knows that deep down ... ... the attraction passes. And then what is left? And what is left, how long can it last? Can you be happy forever with someone? I have no more answers... only questions. - What are you doing here? - I've come to the concert. The violin looks better. - I don't know where Marie is. - I didn't come for that. - Do you know where she is? - No, no news. - Did she leave for good? - It seems so. - You are very talented, you played well. - Do you think? - I used not to care about all that. - About what? Your violin, your music. Now I understand. What do you understand? That it's your whole life That it can touch mine. - I understand ... I don't understand anything. - Do not Cry. When you play, you are beautiful as if you made love. How nice. - Hi, Martine. - Hello Victor. - But it is too early! - I do my morning exercises. - Have you become Muslim? - No, I sold Rambouillet's house. - Ah. - The carpet made me understand. It is magical. I have sold everything. I gave all my dresses ... ... to Concepcion and fired her. I replace her. Now I work for Paul. - Ah, then everything is fine between the two of you. - We are in heaven. - Well, great. - Have you seen the sun? Hello, do you know a certain Michou? Michou? He lives with his brother, who has the sick wife. Ah, Djamila, she's there, on the ground floor. Djamila? Hello, I'm looking for a certain Michou who lives with his brother ... He's gone shopping, he'll be back in 5 minutes. - I'm Victor, a friend. - Ah, you are Victor? Come in, we are celebrating. Remi, who is it? Victor, a friend of Michou. He has finally come. Tell him to come see me. Yes, but first let me offer him something to drink. That's my wife, she is sick; she can't get out of bed. - And what is her name? - Djamila. - Oh, she's Arabic? - You don't like Arabs? Yes, yes, I like them a lot, I adore them, that's not why ... ... because Michou told me ... but I think I didn't understand ... I like Arabs. - What do you want to drink? - Whatever. Do not bother. Today we celebrate because they gave me the subsidy. I got the minimum, but I've been expecting it for a year. Great. I had to stop working to take care of my wife. What are you saying? Nothing, nothing! You know ... Michou has told her so much about you... Ah, ok. My mother died when Michou was two years old. ... and since I was the oldest, Djamila and I brought him up. - Oh, right. - Djamila is like a mother to him. I invited Mohamed, Farid and also Lucien. Ah, you're here Mr. Victor? Hi Michou. You're lucky! My brother celebrates the subsidy. I bought champagne. Rene, come, I have to talk to you! I'm coming! - Did I find it easily? - But I thought you were racist? - Of course I'm a racist. - And Djamila? With Djamila, it's different, she is my brother's wife. And she raised me. she's like my mother. So why are you saying you hate Arabs? Because I can't stand them except Djamila. Djamila is not exactly Arab, she is a woman. But you invited Mohamed and Farid. Are they women too? They are friends from school. It's different. - I don't understand anything anymore. - There is nothing to understand. - Some champagne? - Yes, yes. For once, I am the one who offers you a drink. Michou! Tell your friend to come see me. Leave him alone. She wants to see him at all costs. Just for a while. She 's speaks a lot ... Don't be too soft. No problem. I don't mind. Ah, one thing. Try not to cry when you see her. It's not easy. Why would I cry? We have been holding out for months. Don't bring her morale down. But do you think I have the easy tear? I close the curtains, so if you start crying, she won't see it. All this sun is not good for you. The doctor says it tires you. Here's our Victor. Good morning Good morning, madam. Sit down. He closed the curtains because he's scared you will cry. Look. you're crying. I see it well even though the curtains are closed. Let it out. It is good to cry. Soothe the pain. - So your wife left you. - Yes. Michou told me everything and that you also lost your job. - Yes. - Cry, it's good. - Do you love your wife? - I don't know. - Why did she leave? - I don't know. - You want her to come back? - Yes. I'm going to make her come back. Tell me how you make love to her. When a woman leaves, that means she was not loved properly. Now tell me everything and we will find a solution. - I wouldn't know ... How to say it? - Victor, I'm old, I'm dying. About love, I've already heard it all. I will help you to make your wife fall in love again. ... that she will never be able to leave you. But you must tell me everything ... ... because I can't cure someone if I don't know what illness they have. Do you understand? - So ... how many times a week? - Usually... - Mohamed, what's up? - Michou! - Farid! - Michou, what's up? - Lucien! - And, happy? Farid, Lucien, about time, they gave it to me! Well you did! You got the subsidy! Long live the subsidy! Long live Djamila! Pleasure itself is a bit of a stupid thing. I do this to you, you do that to me ... ... and then the screaming. Really totally ridiculous! And if we think about it, they all do the same... "Silly", as Michou says. And so you get tired, but in reality it is not like that. Actually, there is a stronger pleasure than the others. It's the one that never ends, believe me, not for you, not for her. - It's the one that can't be silly. - Oh yeah? Now I'm going to tell you, but it's a big secret. You will see. Listen carefully. How much time did they give? Two or three months. It is widespread. In the hospital they don't want her anymore. You should tell her brothers. They haven't seen her for 30 years. Fuck those fucking racist Muslims. Please! Stop talking bad about the Muslims. Aren't they assholes? Tell me the truth. They despised her because she married a Frenchman. Her mother died without being able to see Djamila again. And our son died at 25 without ever having met ... .. neither his grandparents nor his uncles. And aren't the Muslims assholes? - Okay, they're assholes. - All assholes ... except Djamila. And you, and the other Muslims friends, our building ... .. the B, the C, also the D. And the shopkeeper, and that's it. So, to the health of the Muslim friends. - To the health of Muslim friends. - And the subsidy! I'm counting on you for Michou. He has to stop drinking. - No, there's no chance. - What do you mean, no chance? No chance, alcoholics have no hope. Why do you say such a thing? He is my little treasure, my Michou. The only thing left for me. You cannot say that alcoholics have no hope. You want to kill me now? You must find him a good wife... ... who will love him and you will see how chance returns. He needs a girl and you are going to find her. Maybe I can hook him again with Francoise. Franoise! Is she the one who spent the night at the bar with him? - Yes. - She is the woman of his life. Try to fix it. But it is not that easy, she is bourgeoise and she's a golddigger. But no! She is like all the others, she's looking for love. And if I tell Michou the secret, she will never let him get away. Let see. - Does he have a house or not? - Michou? No, he doesn't. He lied to me. He told me he was leaving ... ... because he found a room, but he actually wanted to give me .. ... some space when I got back from the hospital. Oh, right. You know what! You teach him to type. .. and you take him as your secretary. No, impossible, I am also unemployed and ... ... with all the best will, he's so useless. What are you saying? Have you come to assassinate me? You have to teach him, that's all. Later, he'll learn. If nobody teaches anything, nobody learns anything! But it is not easy. You don't realize! Yes, I realize. He's too stupid, huh? I didn't say he was stupid. It's not because of that. I know he's stupid. He can't do anything. But no, he's great, everyone loves him very much. - I'm tired. - Shall I call your husband? No, no, it's okay. You are afraid of death, right? Yes. However, I'm the one who should be afraid, I'm the one dying. - No, you are not going to die. - Now go and call Michou. Yes. You will remember the secret, right? Yes. If you remember, you will be happy for life. Yes, thank you. Michou, she wants to see you. It has been very strong. They should have seen the scene. Come on, another glass of champagne. Let's toast! - Okay. - Cheers. No, look, I can't do it. You're a pain. And are you going to be less formal with me? It's Djamila who put that nonsense in your head. What a nosy one, Djamila! You start on Monday and stop breaking my balls, and you help me find a job. We put an ad right now. - What did Djamila tell you? - A secret. She also told me a secret. What is it? Maybe it's the same. I can't tell you because it's a secret. The bed goes here. - Do you know that I also slept here? - That's nice. You'll be fine. Turn it off when you go out and don't put anything on it. - Do you have a toothbrush? - Uh ... - No, I don't think so. - Great. - Hi, Mom, it's Victor. - Victor, sweetie. What a joy! - Has Isa given you my new phone number? -Yes. And how are you? Things are better? Yes, yes. What about you? Well, I'm fine. Are you feeling good? You don't feel any pain? What pain? Why should I be in pain? Are you in good health? - What's wrong, Victor? - Nothing, I just wanted to know. Are you worried about me? Yes. Are you worried about me? Are you feeling good? Is everything okay? Yes, Victor, I'm fine. I have no desire to die. I love you, mom. Fuck! This is the last straw. Victor calls me to tell me he loves me. Allo? Yes, here is my brush. I love you too. Right hand: pretty. Both hands together without looking. Joy. If this exercise seems long to you, spend more time on it. The hands-on exercise does get a bit complicated, but don't give up. - Go on. -Hi, good morning, Victor Barelle studio. No, your Parisian accent is so thick, try to articulate more. - Use a warmer voice. - How warmer? A little more imposing, like "Hello ..." ".. good morning, Victor Barelle studio." Do you understand? Without exaggeration, of course. Yes, okay. Good morning, Victor Barelle studio. Maybe with a little practice ... Let's move on. - I'd like to speak to Mr. Barelle. - Yes, I'll pass it on! No, don't pass it on right away, t looks like I don't have a job. First you must say: "May I know who is calling?" - "May I know who is calling?" - Watch the accent! May I know who is calling? "I am Mr. So-and-So." Now you say, "He's on the other line, can you wait?" - He's on the other line, can you wait? - The accent! He's on the other line, can you wait? Or you can say: "Mr. Barelle is in meeting ..." ".. I'll let you know right away, please wait." Mr. Barelle is in meeting, I'll tell you right away, please wait. Well, now you press this button. And the guy doesn't hear anything. Don't forget to press it... .. Otherwise the guy hears everything. See, the light is on. You tell me who it is and I tell you what to say: "I'm putting you through Mr. Barelle". Or "Mr. Barelle will call you back..." ".. in 5 minutes". Or: "Please leave me your details." I put you through with Mr Barelle. First press the button otherwise he won't hear anything. Ah. I put you through with mr. Barelle. Mr. Barelle .. .. will call you in 5 minutes. You better leave me ... What was it already? Leave me your details. details. Leave me your details. I can't do it, I messed up. But no, you have to practice! You must pay attention ... .. to the sounds of words, to phonetics and pronunciation. You must say "Let me go .. no" Let me go. "What! It is the correct phonetics. And the phrase: "It's okay" no "You okay". Do you understand? Repeat with me: "A bell that sticks because it does not know what to do." - a bell that sticks... - No, say it better. Pronounce "ka" properly. Clear. A bell that sticks because it does not know what to do ... And when should I say this phrase? You should not say it, it is a phrase like that, to say the sound "ka" Yes, but that "ka" I don't know where to put it. Michou, you are exhausting. Let's work. - Can I have a beer? - No beer. You're a pain! Begin. Hello, good morning, Victor Barelle studio. Yes, but watch your accent. Hello, good morning, Victor Barelle studio ... Hello, good morning, Victor Barelle studio. No, I am his assistant. May I know who is calling? Yes. He's on the other line. Can you hold? Yes, yes! I'll let him know right away; Please wait. Mr. Victor, come quickly! He is finishing a conversation right away. He is coming. Mister Victor! - I'm looking for you everywhere! - What is it? There is a guy on the phone. It seems very important. He says he knows you, he knows about your his dismissal .. ... and wants to give you a job because ... - Has he told you who he is? - Yes, a last name that has "De". A fine guy, from the high society, really posh accent. One who is refined. Almost gay ... I don't know if he's gay, but the voice says it all: I've heard that Victor Barelle is available. The kind that seems to perfume themselves with roses when they speak. What is it? - The button. - What did I do? - The button. - What button? You should answer, because hopefully ... ...it could be the end of the struggle! - The button. - Stop annoying me with this button thing ... I do not get it. No ... Ah, shit! The button! Shit! Excuse me, Mr. Victor. Excuse me, Mr De La Tachere, I'll pass you over to Mr Barelle. When she arrives, don't move, you look at her with an idiotic smile. - As an idiot ... I'll do what I can. - I see, you've been offended. Not at all, I'll smile like an idiot. - And above all, think ... - Yes, about Djamila's secret. And so are you going to try? You like her, don't you? I don't know if I like her. And you're the boss. I'm the boss? It's comfortable to say that. You play the part of the nice guy... .. and I the one with the bad boss, is that it? You're nothing more than a ball breaker. - Okay, I'm a ballbuster. - Do you want to know why you are like that? You are so afraid of being wrong that you do everything wrong on purpose. So you can say that you have never been wrong. Because you haven't even tried not to be wrong. Wait, I don't follow you. What I mean is "Have some guts". Some balls... Ah, there she is! But she's with a guy. Ah, how beautiful she is. Don't worry, it's her husband, her ex. Remember about the smile. Yes, yes, I have it written, but the lawyer says ... I don't give a damn! - Hi, Laurent! - Victor, what are you doing here? I learned from Francoise that you were getting divorced today ... .. and I come to raise your spirits a little. Oh yeah? Do you know that they also fired me? - Oh yeah? No kidding, you too? - Yes, three days after you. You deserve it, asshole. Maybe, but that way I avoid paying your pension, bitch. Oh hi, Francoise, how are you? Ah, Michou! My little bear! How are you, sweetheart? Oh I'm fine Yes, yes , well ... - And who is this? - Shall we go to the movies? - Ah ... yeah, sure ... Let's go to the movies. - Ah ... and what's up since last time? A lot of things have happened to me. Tell me, tell me... First, he doesn't want me to drink beer anymore. It's carzy how women like him so much. But who is that guy? Laurent! Oh hi, Victor. Excuse me, love, I couldn't park. - Hello, Therese. - Therese and I are together. - Ah, congratulations. - Have you found another job? No, not yet. I want to apologize for the other time. I left you, but ... - It doesn't matter. - Yes, but I wanted to ask you something. I would love to work with you again, because Laurent is unemployed ... .. and that also applies to me, so I told myself ... No thanks, I already have an assistant. A very good boy. It's Michou actually... .. the one who just left with Francoise. Really? That guy? Hey! Guys, hi! Shit! The sandwiches! Ah, how are you? We arrive tomorrow. At 12:37. Good. See you at the station. Are the kids okay? Very well. They had a lot of fun. Although they are a bit sad ... ... because you haven't called them. Yes, you're right, but I've had a horrible week. I am at your house, for the sandwiches ... ... but I didn't find them. How did I not find them? Did I look on the kitchen table? Yes, but they are not. I mean ... they weren't. You are you at my house now? I have not been able to pass before. I was very busy. - They must have spoiled. - No, because they are not there. The concierge must have taken them. Or the cleaning lady. They don't have the keys. I've been burglarized? No, I don't think so; everything is in its place. How weird. Yes, it's weird. That is why I preferred to call you. Have you heard from Marie? No, none. What will you do with the kids if she doesn't come back? You really believe that she will not come back? I don't know. But what do you think? I don't know ... These days I asked myself what was missing. Yes? If it was her or the mother of my children and everything else. I think about her hands, her hair, her back. I know the shape of her shoulders by heart and I love them. Yes. And she is also a smart and organized woman. She better! How that she better? With you... I am disorganized, is that it? Look, Victor, I am me and my daughter is my daughter. And what I say is my opinion. I haven't talked to her at all. Do you think it's fair that she's gone? This sandwich thing, for example, it's annoying. You cannot be relied on. The kids waited for news every day and you didn't call. Things like that. - They asked about me every day? - Yes. I'm a real idiot. In this last few months, Marie was very tired. - And you didn't notice. - Oh yeah? No, I did not realize. I don't realize anything, I don't understand anything ... ... I feel like I'm living in the fog. If you feel in the fog, it means that you begin to see. You mean I was so blind that I couldn't even see the fog? A bit. In my life, there was only one thing I should not have screwed and that is Marie ... ... because she is my life. It doesn't happen often, I know. Now I have understood. But it's too late. Yes. Thanks for taking care of the kids. Kiss them for me. See you tomorrow. Yes, see you tomorrow. Take care. Courage! Is there anyone? Yes, me. - Marie, are you here? - Yes - You were here the whole time? - Yes, the whole time - And what have you done? - I read. And I rested. - And why did you take everything? - Because... ...I did not know if I would come back. And now, you know? - Why did you say you were with someone else? - To be at peace. - But is there another one? -You know that's not the problem between us. Don't you think it's too late?
