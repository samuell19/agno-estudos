(helicopter whirring) - Get us out of here, it's no longer under control. - [Dispatch] Please diagnose it. - Omega One depends on a central memory bank. - [Dispatch] Please diagnose it. - It must be its central memory bank. - [Pilot] Take a look at the landing stripe, and the camera, any damage? - [Copilot] Doesn't seem so. - [Pilot] The circuit has gone haywire. (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Target fire. (artillery firing) (dramatic electronic music) - [Dispatch] Black Eagle, insert diagnosis circuit. - They're completely blown! What the hell is going on here? - [Dispatch] Please diagnose it. - We're not gonna make it. - Mayday, mayday, Black Eagle to base, do you read, over! - [The Hunter] Enemy sighted, moving target, track and search. (digital vocalizing) (artillery firing) (explosion booming) (dramatic orchestral music) (explosion booming) - [Dispatch] Switch is jammed, change frequencies. We have radio contact with you now, Black Eagle, but your diagnosis check is not manifest on screen. Give us verbal run down. - Link ups are not responding! Circuits are blowing one by one! We're drifting, everything is out, sensors, gauges, the works! Everything! - [Dispatch] Makes no sense, Black Eagle. We pick up no malfunctions from here. (digital vocalizing) (dramatic electronic music) (explosion booming) (artillery firing) (artillery firing) (explosions booming) The Omega One prototype Is performing its program, Black Eagle. - There must be a breakdown In its main memory bank. - [Dispatch] Hit it with a radar signal. - All our signal functions are out, and besides, Omega One hasn't responded. We have lost control, repeat, we have lost control. - [Dispatch] Hang in there, we'll do a backwards check on Omega One's communications log. - Hurry, for Christ sake! - [Dispatch] Keep radio contact. Give us visual break down, your position every 60 seconds. - [The Hunter] Enemy sighted, moving target, track and search, receive, on target, on target, on target, fire, fire! (helicopter exploding) - [Officer] Here we have Corporal Neil Corey, expert heavy weapons, top marksman rating. (slide clicking) Private Larry Guarino, crack reconnaissance man, known as Diddy, and Diddy Bop. (slide clicking) Ex Vietnam medical officer, Alfred Bray, dubbed Papa Doc. (slide clicking) Sunny Feel, martial arts expert. His friends call him Blood. (slide clicking) Nung Quo, forward scout and point taker, renamed Quang, carryover from the Vietnam campaign. (slide clicking) And this is our coordinator, Major Murphy Black. - [Mascher] Ah, yeah. - [Officer] Multi-decorated field officer, better known as Kill Zone. - Why do they have nicknames? - You should know what the group is called, BAM. - BAM? - Big ass motherfuckers. - Sort of like get to it and go get fucked like in 'Nam. - They're professionals, Mascher, the best, anti-guerilla experts, they know the area, and they're your best bet for finding our lost friend, Omega One. - Hmm. - What do you intend to do about Omega One? - Just find him, and neutralize him. We'll worry about the rest later. - What about these BAM soldiers of yours? - We'll have to keep them in the dark. We'll pass you off as the mission's technical advisor, but they must never learn the whole truth, before or after. - So, what when they find him, they'll know then? - That's my problem. You just worry about getting your part of the job done, clear? - All right, sir.

(laughing) - Okay guys, now it's up to you. I'll see you here in exactly three days. - What if there's a delay? - I'll cruise out to sea from the disembarkation point, for two days, those are the orders. - Affirmative. - Hi, Mascher. - So, what's the mission? - Simple, we have to beach two rafts. Think you can handle that? - Beach where? - An island, not far from here. We're not expecting too much resistance, so-- - What's this we? - Well, I'm coming with you. - Sorry pal, my men and I work alone. General Jackson knows that damn well. - Look. You've got your orders, and I got mine. - I don't like this business, I don't like you. - You don't have to like me, you have to work with me. - You know what this mission is all about?

All meeting points, frequencies are final. - What's the possibility of back up? - I'm your backup, one way ticket. - Well, you know what they say, life's a bitch, then you die. What the hell's that? - My accessories. (gun cocking) There. - Quang, take out the point! Corey, Guarino, rear guard, rest, fall in behind me. Move out! - I think he said to move out. - Let's go. (dramatic electronic music) (animals chittering) - Hey, it's nice here, like back home in Alabama up here. - [Diddy] Up yours! (laughing) Move along, Doc! You walk like a ruptured duck. - [Arthur] Huh? I feel like one. - [Neil] You're doing fine, Doc, don't listen to that ginny bastard. - [Arthur] Thank you. - [Diddy] Fuck you! - [Neil] You're welcome. - [The Hunter] Retreat, dot dash dash, enemy sighted, moving target. Track and search. (garbled speaking) - Huh? What is it? - Shh, do you see Quang? - Of course. - When he takes point, that means danger. (dramatic music) - Where? - There. - Peel! (screaming) (gun firing) - Whoever it was, it ain't no more. - Let's move out. (spitting) (dramatic music) - Shit, man. I couldn't done all that. - 'Course not. Can't you see he's been dead for days? - [Diddy] Looks more like years. - Sweet mother of mercy. Can't you smell that stink? Lordy lordy, his guts have been all scooped out. This is really weird. - It was a guerilla. - [Peel] Poor bastard. - [Murphy] This is what's left of his rifle. - [Peel] Good god. - [Murphy] You tell me, is this an auspicious start to our mission? - Murphy! Sniper, half a click ahead. I saw a glint in the trees. There. - All right, let's go, with me. Down! - There, go on. - [Peel] Oh dear. - [Diddy] Peekaboo. - [Mascher] Did you spot him? - Uh huh. - I can see it. I can see the son of a bitch. - Where? Where is he? - Just follow my line of fire, and you can't go wrong, baby. - I'll take care of that little mother. - Hmm, he's mine. (guns firing) Hold it, he's dead. (body thumping) - [Peel] Holy shit, this one's been gutted, too. - [Diddy] He's putrefied like the other one. Yet, we saw him move. - His weapon is still up there. - I'll go. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (grunting) - [Diddy] Oh, Christ. (suspenseful rock music) (eerie ambient warbling) (eerie ambient warbling) (animals hooting) (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) - Bray! Goddammit, get me out! God that hurts! (screaming) Bray! - Give me a hand here. Hold him. - [Peel] No, don't touch it! Let Papa Doc! - Take it easy, Peel. (Blood screaming) (groaning) - It's a budgie. Oh those sneaky little bastards. They're using the same techniques as a Charlie. - Easy man, easy. Old Papa Doc's gonna patch you up, make you strut real good. - Ah quit your bellyaching, Peel. Look at it this way. Now we all gotta smell your feet, and they ain't gardenias. - Just let me get my hands on that motherfucker. I swear to god, just for one minute. - Where's Quang? - Shit. - Uh huh. - [Diddy] Go ahead. - Take it easy. - Now what? - There's something in there. - I don't see anything in it. - I'm gonna go check it out. You stay here and say your name every 30 seconds. - You're gonna leave me here by myself? - Just obey orders! Remember, every 30 seconds. - Every 30 seconds, huh? Okay. Fuck yourself. (suspenseful electronic music) (birds cawing) (grunting) (sizzling) (bird squawking) (bird squawking) - It is not guerilla technique, because they kill their own men, Major, and that is not true. - Why are they all hacked up? - It is strange, Major. It look like an ambush. They shoot in all directions. - Doesn't make any sense. - It is scary. There are no isolated tracks. He's a ghost or a very special man. - Bastards! I'm gonna get you for this. Doesn't take a fucking PhD to realize you've got it in for me. (digital vocalizing) Who's there? Show yourself or I'll shoot! (gun cocking) (digital vocalizing) You gotta pay for this. - [The Hunter] Enemy sighted, moving target. Track and search. - Black? Black, is that you? You incredible shithead, show yourself! (digital vocalizing) It's you! (beeping) (digital vocalizing) Black! - What was that sound? What happened? - You wanted me to get killed back there, didn't you? - Just answer the question. - A guerilla attacked me. But I'm alive. - Major, come take a look! Did you do that? - What the hell? Take a man with a sledgehammer to do that. (sizzling) Damn, that's hot! Jesus. (suspenseful electronic music) How's the leg doing, Peel? - [Peel] It's fucked, but I've been through worse. - [Neil]] It'd be nice if we knew what the hell we were looking for. - [Diddy] I don't think there's an answer to that. We're stalking something. - Yeah, Quang's ass. - [Mascher] Quiet! Stalking what? - [Arthur] I don't know. Does it make any difference? - What is it? - Vibration, someone there. - I don't see anybody. - [Quang] Quang feels vibrations. - Yeah, right. And his balls began to tingle and jingle. (laughing) (suspenseful rock music) (speaking foreign language) What are you, a psychic? - Shut up. (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) - They're running them down like jackrabbits. What do we do, Major? - Look, we are not supposed to do anything except carry out this mission. - I say let's get ready for clean kill. - [Mascher] What does that mean? - It means you better duck, shithead, "cause we're gonna start settling some accounts here. (speaking foreign language) (gun firing) - [Virgin] Oh God! Oh God! - I bet one of these assholes is the practical joker who set the trap. (speaking in foreign language) Hey, asshole! (screaming) (guns firing) - [Virgin] No! (screaming) (speaking foreign language) - One! - I kill her! (woman whimpering) - Two! - I kill her! - Three. (gun firing) (groaning) (gun firing) (digital vocalizing) Incoming, get outta here! Come here! (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] On target, receive, fire, fire, fire. (vehicles exploding) - What the hell? There must be more of them, and they're well-armed. - Could it be maybe a machine? - What about her? We can't leave her here. - There is no way that she can come along. She's dead weight. - Listen asshole, I'm in command here, and the girl is coming with us. Quang, take the point, all right, move out! Come along. (suspenseful orchestral music) (distant digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Enemy sighted, moving target, track and search, receive. Enemy elevation prohibits, receive. Standard drop in frequency, receive. Targets entered, receive, on target, receive. (digital vocalizing) On target, receive. (digital vocalizing) Receive. (frogs croaking) - Shit man, I've seen some heavy greens in my time, but this sure takes the cake. - Yeah, it's like collard green stew. If you get caught in it, you never get out of it man. - Damn right. (dramatic orchestral music) - Thank you. - So where are you coming from? - We were coming from the hospital in San Pedro when we heard about what happened. - What did happen? - You don't know? I thought that's why you came here. The entire village of Coronada was razed down to the ground. Everyone was killed, the women, the children. There's no one left. - Who were those men chasing you? - I don't know. But there's something really weird going on in this region. - Why did you put a hospital here? - About two years ago, there was a cholera epidemic. We were sent here as a group of volunteers for the UN. Now they're all dead. There's no one left. Only me. - [Murphy] You're all right. (suspenseful music) - [Arthur] You okay, Peel? - [Peel] Yeah, all right man. (grunting) - [Murphy] Oh, where are we? - [Peel] That's a good guess. (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Target fishing, target fishing. (digital vocalizing) Receive. (digital vocalizing) Receive, receive. (animals calling) - Is this San Pedro? - It's what's left of it. - Yeah, and it's crawling with fucking maniacs ready to blow our heads off. So what do we do now, Major? - Major, this is not our mission. I suggest we keep moving. None of our fucking business here. - Corey, Guarino, take out the guards. Move out. - Major, I said that this is not-- - Peel! - Now shut your fucking face, you cocksucker. - You're pushing it, Mascher. You get the message? (suspenseful rock music) (speaking in foreign language) (groaning) - [Diddy] Ah shut up, damn you. - Guarino got one. (humming) (groaning) All right, get ready to rock and roll. Quang, take the point. Move out. Doc, you watch the girl. And Mascher, you're next. Stay outta the way. Peel, take rear guard. - We'll just sit tight, honey, and squeeze. - Huh. - [Diddy] Hey, buckwheat. (groaning) (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (screaming) (screaming) - Sorry. (gun firing) (shouting) (explosion booming) (guns firing) (men shouting) (laughing) - Yeah. (yelling) (speaking foreign language) (gasping) (gun firing) (yelling) (screaming) (grunting) - [Diddy] What are you gonna do, Quang, when it's all over? (explosion booming) (speaking foreign language) (gun firing) - [Quang] Same thing we're going to do now. Come on. (laughing) - Gonna die! (screaming) (guns firing) (men shouting) - Damn it, you scared the shit out of me. Cut that out. Easy. (grunting) (grunting) (speaking foreign language) (laughing) - [Peel] Heads up. (explosion booming) - [Murphy] Easy does it, one at a time. (screaming) - [Diddy] Hey, where are you going? (gun firing) (men groaning) (screaming) - Here. (grunting) Don't move. - Let's go. - Damn good job. All right, let's make a clean sweep of the area. - [Virgin] Where are they? Where are the children? The children! - Stay outta there! Shit! All right, Peel, cover our ass. Follow me! - [Peel] Huh, cover her ass. Who's gonna cover mine? (groaning) (dramatic music) (woman whimpering) - No! Why? (sobbing) They're just children! (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Enemy sighted, moving target, track and search, receive. (digital vocalizing) - That's just what I need. (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Receive, fire. (loud explosion) (Blood groaning) - Get outta here, move! - Hey, that's Peel! Come on! - No! - Come on! - No! - Come on! - Peel! Good Christ. Come on, man. Doc, Doc! (woman crying) - [Arthur] Oh no, dirty piece of... - Looks like mortars. - [Arthur] Sons of bitches. - No, it's not guerillas. - What are they? - Just one. He no hide, yet we no see him. - What do you mean, one? (digital vocalizing) (loud explosions) (digital vocalizing) Get outta here! Move it! Come on, move! - [The Hunter] Fire, fire, fire. (explosion booming) - Hey, look at that. (digital vocalizing) - What is that? - It is he. - What do you mean, he? - The Hunter. He killed Peel. Peel was my friend. Now I'm gonna get to you, you bastard. (gun firing) (digital vocalizing) - Guarino, get back here! All right, let's get the crazy little fucker. Quang, Corey. Mascher, you stay here with her. - How can one man do all this? - Well, suppose he isn't a man, you know, something more than a man. - Where are you hiding, you son of a bitch? Come out or else I'll blow your balls off! (gun firing) - Guarino! - Hey, Diddy Bopper, come out man! (digital vocalizing) (suspenseful electronic music) (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Enemy sighted, moving target, receive. (gun firing) (screaming) - Guarino! Guarino, get back here! (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] On target, on target, on target, on target, receive, receive. (screaming) (explosion booming) (digital vocalizing) - No. Oh shit. Major. - Guarino? - Yeah, but it's not very pretty. - Damn. - It's his hand. - [Murphy] What happened to the rest? - [Neil]] I don't even wanna think about it. - [Quang] Major, I think this belonged to Lieutenant Woodring. Remember him? - Yeah, well now we gotta look for Guarino. All right, let's find the rest of his body. Search the whole area.

There's no body. There's no traces at all. We didn't hit a damn thing. - All right, we'll set up a defensive perimeter up on that ridge. Quang, take point. Corey, rear guard. Move out! Virginia, come on! BAM to Red Dog, BAM to Red Dog. Come in, Red Dog. Come in. - Forget it. Nobody out there to answer you. You see, we're all alone, you, me, and him. They make it. - You son of a bitch. You're gonna tell me everything you know, or I'm gonna slit your fucking throat. - All right, all right, all right, take it easy. What do you wanna know? - What the fuck was that thing we saw? - It's a weapon. - What do you mean? - Look, why don't you move this knife? - No way! - Guerilla activities, you know, state department losing face and stuff like that. - You're not telling me anything I don't know. - All right, all right. Omega One is the perfect and ultimate weapon. It was released to reverse the situation. - You're telling me you invented that thing? - Yes. Together with my team of bionic experts. - You bastard. You have any idea what you did? - Of course I do. I mean, I told them it was a little premature. You know, I had more tests to do, things like that, but-- - Now it's out of control. - Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Well, if you created it, then you can destroy it. - Afraid not. I don't even know everything this thing can do. - Then what the fuck you doing here? - Well, maybe I'm checking on you. They sent you, the great hero. You're the expert. So I figured, you know, my Omega One pitched against the real, flesh and blood hero. Perfect match. (chuckles) I wonder who's gonna win? (crickets chirping) (frogs croaking) - That guy crazy, no good Major, maybe you better kill him. - No, he hasn't told us everything he knows yet. - I make him tell the truth. - No, it wouldn't do any good. He'd die before he talks. But he's getting scared. Just keep an eye on him, Quang. - Quang will be his shadow. (dramatic rock music) (loud explosions booming) (guns firing) (explosion booming) (grunting) - [Officer] Sergeant Murphy, Sergeant Woodring! Jesus Christ, we're in a mine field! - [Murphy] Everybody freeze! - [Marty] I'll go on ahead. - [Murphy] Marty, hang back! (loud explosion booming) (groaning) Marty! Marty! - [Murphy] Martin Woodring. (suspenseful synth music) - [Arthur] A river, that's all we need. - [Neil] Shut up, Doc. - All right, we gotta cross it. - [Neil] I'll go first. - Okay. How deep, Corey? - [Neil] Not too bad, the girl might have to swim it. - Whatever you're up to, Mascher, I don't like it. - What do you mean? - I was on one side, that thing on the other, and you in the middle. Watch out, the next time one of us dies, Quang is gonna slice off your ears and cram your balls down your throat. - I can do nothing to stop it. - I hope that's true, for your sake. - Riverbed's okay, Murphy. Okay, I'll cover you, cross now. - Quang, you go next, help Virginia. - Yes, sir. You go, you hold onto my shoulder, okay?

Try again? - [Neil] Yeah. - You know, it won't make any difference. He's much stronger than all of you. - And you? - What about me? - Are you stronger than him? - [Mascher] Hey, you crazy? - [Quang] You're crazy. - No! (laughing) - Now, we are all even, heh. - Dammit, we almost had him. - All right, let's follow the river. Maybe he's still alive.

Hey, I'm over here! Where the hell are you? - Bray! Bray! (digital vocalizing) - No, no way. No, no! (sighs) - Papa Doc, you made it. - Yeah, it was right there behind me. But it's not there anymore. At least I hope not. It's scary as all hell. - Hey, what's that on your foot? - Huh? (digital vocalizing) (screaming) - Bray! (screaming) (digital vocalizing) (screaming) - I gotta do this, or he's gonna kill us all. I've got to do it. No. No. (ominous music) - Oh my god. - That's it. No more running. We're gonna fight this fucker. - [Neil] You think a few logs and some shrubs are gonna stop that thing? - [Murphy] No. - [Neil] Then what the fuck are we digging for? - [Murphy] To hide! - [Quang] Major. - [Murphy] Yeah. - I laid the grenades and mines all over the place. This monster won't get anywhere near here without causing an explosion. - Well done, Quang. Now we wait and see. - [Quang] Yes, we wait and see. - All right, everybody inside. Good. If he tries to get near, we can see him, and he'll be blown to hell. - He's picking us off, one by one like a hunter. - What was that device on the belt that Quang threw in the river? - Electromagnetic impulses to control computers. Near harmless for humans. - Could you have destroyed him with it? - No, but we would have had another weapon, if that gook hadn't acted like a madman. - You son of a bitch! You're the crazy fuck that invented that thing out there. - He built it? - Yeah, and that son of a bitch is proud of it, too. - Why? - Technology doesn't have feelings. Either function, or malfunction. - You fuck! - You heard him. He's got no feelings, he's technology. He'd be very happy to fix the fucking machine. Now listen to me, you bastard. Get out there and fix your lousy toy. - Back off, Corey. - I don't want him in here. He killed Peel, Guarino, and Bray. It was all his fault. - I feel the same damn way. But we need him alive. He's the only one who can do anything. - Like what? We don't have a controlled machine anymore. - Corey, look in his bag. - Major. - What is this? Last chance, fuck. Tell me. - It's for destroying him, a detonator. - You got the weapon. So what do we need him for? - No, this thing will not work unless I'm the one to operate it. - Why? - It's not easy to get it in range of him, and it has a limited distance. - He's bluffing, Major! - Keep quiet! He's out there right now. (suspenseful rock music) (digital vocalizing) (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] Receive. (digital vocalizing) Receive. - Damn it. He's suspicious. He's skirting around us. (digital vocalizing) - He knows it's a trap. - His thermo-sensors, they're signaling the mines to him. - Isn't there some way to block his sensors? Some kind of disturbance? - No, I created him to be perfect. He's programmed to respond to any kind of attack from air, sea, or land. - Then use this damn thing to destroy the fucker. - He's out of range, too far away. Besides, the signal has gotta strike him right in the center of the head. - Well, use the damn thing anyway. (digital vocalizing) - He's too far away, and he's got his back turned. - Just do it. (remote beeping) - Nothing is gonna happen. - He's turning. He's turning around. (digital vocalizing) - [The Hunter] On target, on target. Received. - Get down! - [The Hunter] Fire, fire. (gun firing) Fire. Fire. - What's he up to? - He's isolated the mines. He's blowing a path straight to us. - [The Hunter] Approach, I approach, I approach, I-- (loud explosions booming) Fire. - The mines. He stepped right on them like it was dog shit. Look at him. (digital vocalizing) Can't believe it, there's not a scratch on him. - He can get through. Now he can move in for the kill. - He has won. - Here. Take this, and listen to it as soon as you can. It's important. - What are you doing? - [Mascher] Just stay back. (remote beeping) (ominous orchestral music) - Come on, what are you waiting for? Blow him up! (digital vocalizing) (Mascher screaming) - [The Hunter] On Target. (digital vocalizing) - Get down! (loud explosion booming) Geez. - [Virgin] Good god. - [Murphy] Corey, where you going? - I can't sit here anymore. I've gotta get that box back. - [Murphy] Stay here. - I don't like the view. - All right, cover his ass! (ominous synth music) (digital vocalizing) (gagging) (groaning) Corey, Corey! (digital vocalizing) Get outta here, now! - But the whole field is mines! - We don't have any alternative. Let's go! - [The Hunter] Fire, fire. Fire, fire. Fire. (loud explosion booming) - [Quang] I stay here. - Quang, no! - I stay, Major. - No, we can't leave him here. - He's made up his mind. I'd have to kill him to make him change it.

(digital vocalizing) Target centered, received. (Quang screaming) (digital vocalizing) (loud explosion booming) (Quang's scream echoing) (birds chirping) (suspenseful electronic music) - Oh my god. We're the only ones left. - We're gonna have to run for it. Can you make it? - Yeah. - Okay. (digital vocalizing) - I can't make it, I can't make it. - We can't stop now, he's right behind us. - Wait a minute, the first hospital we built is near here. We had to abandon it because the water supply was polluted. - All right, let's go there. - Okay.

(ominous orchestral music) (wind howling) - There's a storage room at the end of the hall. Maybe there's something in there we can use. - All right, let's go, you lead. Hey. - [Virgin] This room. - I'll go first. - [Virgin] Okay. - It's all right. - Gimme some light here. Good, good, good, good. - What are you thinking? - We have everything here to make me a bomb. - You know how to make napalm? - Yeah, I have a degree in chemistry. I've had some experience with the stuff. Unfortunately, I know all too well what it can do to the human body. - You think it will work on him? - I don't know, but what do we got to lose? - Where do we start? - We start by mixing up this little cocktall, and we turn this hospital into a gigantic bomb.

What you're fighting is more than a machine. There something of the human remaining. To be precise, he's a perfect fusion of human and mechanical parts, The true masterpiece is the brain, bionic and human cell tissues in a superb amalgamation. You are well acquainted with the man we chose to transform into Omega One. Black, Omega One is your friend, Lieutenant Martin Woodring. They brought him into our center more dead than alive. We were able to save only the parts that really interested us, his head and his brain. He'd been singled out to us as the toughest and most brilliant expert in every kind of guerrilla warfare. The man's knowledge, plus the computer that keeps him alive eternally, for all practical purposes, make him an invincible and indestructible war machine.
