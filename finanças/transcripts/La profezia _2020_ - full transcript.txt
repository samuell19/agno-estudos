(BALL THUMPS) (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) -(BALL THUMPS) -STRIA: Hello, Andrea. Yes, I know what your name is. And I also know what you're dreaming about. What if I could make that dream a reality? (CROWD CHANTING) Just listen to your fans. (ECHOING) They're all here to see you play. You're their hero. Your teammates are already on the field. (ECHOING) They're all waiting for you, their champion. (CROWD CHANTING) So, come with me. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) THE KNIGHTS OF CASTELCORVO (THEME MUSIC CONCLUDES) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUFFLED SPEECH) MOM: Well, he couldn't say no. MICHELE: Fine. As long as the kids do what they have to. MOM: Don't worry. MICHELE: Giulia? Giulia? Hey, can you hear me? (NORMAL SPEECH) How many times have I said, "No earbuds at the table"? But we're already done eating. -Sure. But it just isn't polite. -(PHONE RINGING) -(SIGHS) All right, fine. -MICHELE: Excuse me. -I'm sorry. This could be important. -So, it's fine for you? -MOM: Darling. It's a work call. -Hello? What? I can't hear you. I'm only hearing an echo. How about I call you back? Okay, thank you. Yes, bye. You know the reception here is terrible. It's like we're tucked away from the rest of the world. It's the perfect place for the bed and breakfast I've always dreamed about. (CHUCKLES) Well, sure. But couldn't your dream have Wi-Fi? MOM: Michele, remember -your sister is doing us a huge favor. -(GRUNTS) ZIA: Really, it's okay. I'm used to it. It's been this way ever since we were kids. I was the dreamer while he was Mr. Practical. Anyway, I can't wait to show you how beautiful Castelcorvo is. It's a charming little town, full of kind neighbors. People come from all over to see the castle. Giulia, why don't you and Riccardo take a walk around town? I just might. That's a great idea. -I'll find out what he's up to. -ZIA: Sure. (RADIO STATIC) -Ricky! -(GASPS) -(CHUCKLES) Are you doing ballet now? -Very funny. This thing just turned on and off on its own. Well, it's an old clock radio. There's probably a broken wire somewhere. Unless you're telling me you think this place is haunted? -(CHUCKLES) -I don't know about that. But I do know there's no Internet. Seriously, how do you even live without Wi-Fi or fiber optics? I don't expect 5G. But at least, 4G. Yeah! Sounds like a huge problem. Anyway, I'm going into town. Wanna come with? -What do you mean? -I mean to check out the castle. -(SIGHS) Sounds like a blast. -Yup, I'll be downstairs. -Don't take too long. -(RADIO STATIC) (STATIC STOPS) (SIGHS) It's so pretty. (CHUCKLES) Hey, pretty cool that they let us walk around by ourselves here. RICCARDO: (SCOFFS) Come on! What could possibly happen to us in Castelcorvo? -Not get a decent signal, that's for sure. -When are you gonna let that go? When I finish downloading my new point and click game. Seriously, you're getting obsessed with those things. Hey, they're useful. They help develop logical thinking. And which one of us won the Math Olympiad again? -What? Who's that you just said? -(CHUCKLES) -What's his name? -Listen... -Riccardo. -(CHUCKLES) Okay, genius. We're in a new place. Aren't you even a little curious? There's no way Castelcorvo is more interesting than my new game. (SIGHS) Excuse me. Do you have a signal? -Shh! Be quiet and don't move. -(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) -Look, isn't this cool? -Uh. You took a picture of a cockroach. It isn't a cockroach. He's a Xylotrupes Gideon. Normally, it's a corpuscular insect and it's rare to see during the day. -I just got extremely lucky, I guess. -(BIRDS CHIRPING) What are you doing? No. You won't be able to take a decent picture with that one. -I'm not trying to take any pictures. -You need a macro lens. I think I have one somewhere. Oh, hold Jimmy. -I could've sworn I had an extra one... -Jimmy, the Penguin. (CHUCKLES) ...with the cell phone somewhere in here. -(GROANS IN DISGUST) -(LAUGHS) Just slime. RICCARDO: I'm not interested in roaches or whatever. I just wanna know if there's someplace around here with 4G. -4G? -Yeah, civilization. Ever heard of it? Ricky? It's nice to meet you. My name's Giulia. -Matteo. -(INHALES SHARPLY) Uh... -Oh, excuse me. -(CHUCKLES) -Oh, just... -Uh. Riccardo. If you're looking for 4G, you're better off going home and using the Wi-Fi. Wish we had it. Thank you. You've been very helpful. -Let's go, Giulia. -Yes, yes. Uh. And don't forget your penguin. -Thanks. -Bye, Matteo. -RICCARDO: Bye. -MATTEO: Bye. (SIGHS) (SLIME SQUISHES) -RICCARDO: That's it, I give up. -Isn't this place awesome? -Hmm, sure. But now I've seen it. -GIULIA: We should go inside. Come on. RICCARDO: I don't even think we can. Look it says no entry. If it says no entry then we can't go in, Giulia. (SIGHS) If you're looking for princes and princesses, you'll end up disappointed. -This place is nothing special. -Oh, is that so? 'Cause the boredom, the boredom is really something else. -Right. Welcome to Castelcorvo. -But wait, is it really closed? -We can't go inside? -Yeah, it's just some old place that was abandoned. Anyway, is there any chance that you have glue on you? Uh. What? Why would we be carrying glue? (SCOFFS) You're from the city, aren't you? -We arrived just today. -I see. So, no one taught you that you can use glue to fix a flat tire? -Figures. -If you want, as soon as I get a signal, -I can look up a tutorial. -BETTA: No, no. I don't need a tutorial. I can do it myself. -I'm only trying to help out. -MATTEO: Help me! Did either of you hear that? -RICCARDO: What? -GIULIA: Huh? -MATTEO: Help me! -It sounds like Matteo. -(BETTA PANTING) -I think he really needs help. Let's go. You don't wanna eat the cockroach? -I think you wanna eat the cockroach. -No, please. Why did you take all these photos if you didn't wanna eat it? -I think, he wants to eat it. -Yeah, I think he does. -Aldo, give my phone back! -Uh-huh! If you want it so bad, -then open up your mouth. Open it up. -Stop, please. Give it back! -BETTA: You leave him alone! -Now, eat it. -RICCARDO: Stop that. Right now! -MATTEO: Betta! -(ALDO LAUGHS) -MATTEO: Betta! -You okay? -Well, look at this. The freak made a couple new friends. I haven't seen you around Castelcorvo. I bet you're just some city brats, aren't you? You should know I don't like city brats. Well, I don't like you much either. So, we're even. (CHUCKLES) Is he serious? Let's see how tough you are with two black eyes. -That's enough. Back off. -ALDO: Hey, hey! That was a dumb move, you freak. Now, there'll be three black eyes. Four! Two plus two is four, you moron! -Cut that out. -(BETTA GRUNTS) -RICCARDO: What was that? Hey! -GIULIA: Stop, you're hurting her. ALDO: I'm not wasting time with you. Next time, you're gonna eat a bucket of worms for me. -Aldo? -What? It's just, my phone. (LAUGHS) Oh, your phone? I forgot. Here. Come over and get it. Hey, come on. Come on. Come on. Here. -(GASPS) -(CHUCKLES) Hope you find it. He didn't see that coming. Let's go. -I'll help you up. -I don't need your help. Are you okay? -Yeah, it's just a scratch. -You sure? Matteo, you need to learn how to stand up for yourself. (SIGHS) You're right. But what do I do now? If I go home without my phone, my dad is gonna kill me. On top of that, I'll lose all my pictures of the beetle I took. -I'm sure somebody can open this gate. -Definitely. We'll go in and get it. They don't know, do they? -Nope. They're not from Castelcorvo. -We don't know what? This house, it belongs to the Mad Sisters. -Matteo? -Um... -They're two women who just... -Women? Yes. They never leave their house and they have never set foot in town. They're not women at all. -They're witches. -Matteo! -Witches. -Anybody who sees them... they lose all their hair and their teeth fall out. That's crazy. I bet no one even lives here. MATTEO: What are you doing? Wow. But the gate's not locked. If we try to be really careful, we can probably get in and out of there -without anyone noticing us. -Sounds reasonable to me. Sounds reasonable? Does being cursed sound reasonable? I only just got my braces off. I'd like to keep my teeth. -Look, do you want your phone back or not? -Let's go. (GATE CREAKS) (CROW CAWS) -This place is really creepy. -MATTEO: Okay. So, now you see why they call it the Mad Sisters house? That phone won't be easy to find. Aldo threw it really far. We should all split up, it'll be quicker that way. -(SIGHS) -Betta, I'm going with you. (CROW CAWING) Giulia? You okay? (CROW CAWS) Come on. A chessboard? Knight takes queen. That's checkmate. -(CHUCKLES) -(CROW CAWS) -Someone's over there. -I think it's just a shadow. -I'm not so sure. I'll find out. -I'm coming. (GASPS) Oh, no. It's broken. But it's still working. Betta, I found it. -Shh. -Guys, I found it. (PANTING) -Here it is. Just a little scratched. -Okay, now that we found it, let's get out of here. -(PHONE RINGING) -Sorry. My mom is calling. -Shh. -She'll be worried if I don't pick up. -Call her back later. -Hello, Mom? Yes, hi. I won't Mom. I'm just... Okay, got it. I will. Be home in ten minutes. (SCREAMS) Who gave you permission to enter our garden? Nobody. They snuck in without asking. -We're sorry. We didn't mean... -SISTER 2: Silence girl. Arturo has told us, you're all very brave children. And generous too. -Aren't they, Arturo? -(CAWS) -What was that? Hey! -Stop! You're hurting her. One is also a very skilled chess player. SISTER 2: Very well. Let's see how well you handle a little mystery. Know that I live neither here nor there. Half is what you'll see, if you stare. If you beat me, someone will soon be there. -Are you telling us a riddle? -That is correct. You must all think very carefully if you wish to solve it. When the journey at last is done, the Knights will return to their homes all say for one, alone they stay behind to be remembered by none. This is not a riddle... it's a prophecy instead. Riddles are there to be solved, but prophecies can only be accepted. But... why are you asking us to solve this riddle? To reveal if you are the chosen ones. To prove that you're ready for the tests. Able to find the keys. SISTER 2: In other words, if you are truly knights, this shall prove it. Now, go. Leave. Shoo! MATTEO: Guys, wait. Don't leave me behind. BETTA: Hurry up, Matteo! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (RAIN PATTERING) We actually saw the Mad Sisters. I can't believe it. My teeth are okay, aren't they? -Yes but your hair is falling out. -Oh, really? Don't mind him. My brother likes really stupid jokes. -You have any glue? -Yeah, sure. So, not bad for our first day around. (METAL CLANGS) You really fixed it. Incredible. How'd you do that? See you later, city boy. ZIA: I was thinking about getting some animals to set up a little petting zoo. -MICHELE: Ah. -Yes, but it won't have goats, geese or chickens. I was picturing something more... exotic, you know? Something like ostriches. -Oh, well, why not kangaroos? -Kangaroos? -MICHELE: Yes. -Fantastic idea, big brother. -Let's get some kangaroos. -(CHUCKLES) ZIA: I'll have a whole kangaroo family in the garden. -MICHELE: Mm-hmm. -Yes, but I'm sure it must be expensive to ship them in from Australia. Maybe instead I should look into little koalas, that might be easier. (GIULIA AND RICCARDO SPEAKING PIG LATIN) Dad never gets it. Never. Poor Auntie! MICHELE: Hey, kids! You know I don't like it when you talk that way. -ZIA: But I think it's hilarious. -MICHELE: Really? -Yes. What is it? -It's our secret language. -Secret agent stuff. -Wow. So tell me, what were you really saying? That my dad has something to say to you. Don't you, Dad? -I do? -He wanted to say he's sorry. While you were in the other room, he said as long as you're happy here, then he's happy too. -Aren't you, Dad? -Yes, I did. Very happy. -Thank you, Michele. -Look at that. We really should get on our way now. You know, Margarita, we could never thank you enough for doing this. This job has put us in a very difficult spot and we couldn't just leave the children on their own. You two better behave for auntie, all right? Hmm? -Aye aye, Captain. -Oh, aye aye, Captain. Aye aye, Captain, right. Come here and give your dad a goodbye hug. -Huh? -MOM: Buh-bye. -We're gonna miss you. -Mm, come and give me a hug. (CHUCKLES) You promise to be good, all right. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) GIULIA: I'm gonna take the attic. -Hey, can you help me set up? -I'm coming. -Thanks, Ricky. -RICCARDO: No problem. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Know that I live neither here nor there. Half is what you'll see, if you stare. If you beat me, someone will soon be there. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Well, I guess everyone's crazy around here. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (RADIO STATIC) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (STATIC STOPS) What? (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) Ricky, is that you? -(GASPS) -(THUNDER RUMBLING) Who's that? -You have to help me. -Help you? (GASPS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (THEME MUSIC CONCLUDES)
