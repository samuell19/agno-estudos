- breathe, lucy. Breathe. You're doin' great, lucy. - I really wish it was you lying here. - he's almost here. He's almost here. - Oh, there you are. You didn't call me? - Mom, we've been a little distracted, mom. - Now look at you, you're all bunched up there. - Oh. - Let's just- - I'm fine, barbara. - All right, dear. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - I had to find out where you were from those heathen neighbors of yours for god's sake. It's a good thing I stopped by when I did. - Mom, we've got it under control. You don't have to be here. - No, I wanted to give you this. I made it for jason to go home in. - Oh. We've actually decided on nicholas. - don't be ridiculous. Everyone would call him nick and what's the point of having a given name if nobody ever uses it? Please. Jason will suit him perfectly. - Mom, we could really use something to eat. Could you grab us something from the cafeteria? - certainly. What would you like? - Surprise me. - be right back. - ethan, your mother was not part of the birthing plan. She wasn't even nice to me until I got pregnant. And nice is an exaggeration. I'm essentially a vessel for a future grandchild. - She's got a good heart, okay? She's just excited for us. You know how lonely she's been since dad died. - She can hang around for now, but she can't be in the room when I deliver. - Deal. - I mean it, ethan. - I love you. - I love you, too. But I really hate you right now. I think there's something wrong. - how are we doing? - doc, she's in terrible pain. - What's going on? - you're bleeding, mrs. Anders. I'm afraid we'll have to get you into surgery right away. - Is my baby going to be okay? - We'll get you out of here in a moment. Mr. Anders, please go to the waiting area and we'll keep you posted. - it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. - what's happening? - Lucy is fine. She lost a lot of blood but she's recovering now. - And the baby? - There's no easy way to say this. We lost the child. - Lucy was hemorrhaging and in these situations we have to prioritize the life of the mother over the life of the baby. I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do. - I wanna see him. I wanna see my grandson. - I don't think that's a good idea. - I won't ask again, doctor. - that's wonderful. Okay. Okay. - amy, bobby, breakfast! - I'm starving. - No wonder our grocery bill's through the roof. Here you go. - Ugh! Really? - You're 11. Who could you possibly be texting at seven a.M.? - You're on your phone more than me. - Well I'm not playing candy crush, I'm working. - I play other stuff, too. - You're not helping your case. - Can we go to a pizza tonight? - We'll see, I have a late meeting. Your dad's gonna pick you up from school. - are we gonna stay with him tonight? - No, he'll drop you at the office. Oh, shoot. We gotta go. Come on you guys, hurry. - we locked down a bunch of new vendors. - Nice. - Hey, did you get that paperwork? - I have the information you want on ivy gray jewelry back at my desk. - Thank you. Yeah, I'll look it over before I meet with ms. Thompson. - By the way, don't hate me. Becca in accounting told me to give this to you. It's her cell number. - Brian. - You guys are perfect for each other. - Oh yeah? What do we have in common? - Well, you both are single and work in the same office. - Ah, that's very helpful, thank you. - Listen, just think about it, okay? - Yep. Later. - See ya. - Thanks man. - hi, ethan, it's your mother. It's been awhile. I stopped by the cemetery today and... Well, I'm thinking of you. Please call me back. - come in. - Mr. Anders. Nice to see you again. - Ms. Thompson. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. - have you had the opportunity to look over the purchasing details I sent you? - Yes. I'm very pleased with the order. - Great. Did you design this yourself? - I design all my jewelry. - Wow. Well, you must be a busy woman. - you have no idea. - well, if you want to look this over and sign it by next week, we can get the ball rolling. - Certainly. I may have some questions. Would I be able to email you? - Of course. I'm also happy to talk through it with you in person if you'd like. Do you wanna maybe talk some more about it over dinner or... - Mom! Mom- - mom, I need my phone back. Like, you don't understand. See, laura is having a birthday party next week and there's a text chain and I really need to be on it. - Mom, dad said he would take me to see "chainsaw 2." if I don't see it, everyone's gonna be making fun of me. - They are all yours. - You're early. - Oh, sorry. Hey man. - ethan, this is my ex husband, calvin. This bundle of fun is amy and this... Well, this is bobby. - Well, nice to meet you. Look, I've gotta run. Bobby's got this weird rash thing and amy's grounded. I'll let her explain. Love you, bye. - Guys, can you please wait outside for me while I finish up? There's candy on julie's desk. I'm sorry about that. Like I was saying, I can't tonight. If I don't take them for pizza, there might be a revolt. - that's totally okay. I don't wanna stand in the way of pizza night. - Well, you're welcome to come with us. They're quite a handful solo. - Sure. Why not? - Oh no. No, I was kidding. No, you don't wanna come to dinner with my kids. We'll do it some other time. - I'd love to. I mean, if that's all right with you. - okay, well, let me get my stuff. - penny for your thoughts. - A quarter with inflation. Can you afford it? - That's a little steep. - I've just been thinkin' about my parents a lot lately. I wish they were around to watch amy and bobby grow up. I know you're not close with your mother but I'd do anything to have my parents around. You ever think of reconnecting? - It's not that simple. - Well, sure it is. Yeah, you just take out your phone. You know that thing that you keep in your pocket and you go into contacts, search for the number with mom next to it and... Wait, you don't have your mom in here? - It's under barbara anders. - That's psychotic. - My mother... After we lost our son, lucy changed. We both did. We were so distraught, we couldn't imagine going through with another pregnancy. But my mother, she was insistent. She looked into anything and everything. Fostering, surrogacy, adoption. Lucy and I grew apart. And after the divorce, just stopped speakin' to my mom altogether. - Ethan, I'm so sorry. Hm. It sounds like your mother was hurt, too. Maybe that was her way of dealing with it. Trying to make it all better. - Hey, do you think I'm a bad person for shutting her out? - Ethan, I think you're the best person I know. - Kendall, I... but mind you, there's a lot of people in the world that I haven't met yet. So, there's that? - I love you, you know that? - I know. - I've been carrying around this thing for months, just waiting for the right time. But, now seems as good a time as any. - Ethan. - you, amy and bobby, you mean the world to me. Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife? - yes. Yes. Yes. Ethan, can you get that? - Yeah. Are we expecting anyone? Mom? - Hello, ethan. - What are you doin' here? How did you- - barbara, it's so nice to see you again. Come in. Come in. Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink? Some coffee or tea? - Tea would be great, dear, if it's not too much trouble. - no trouble at all. - how's the house, mom? - Oh, you know, way too big for just myself, but I'm just not quite ready to put it on the market... And who do we have here? - This is amy and this is bobby. - Hi, amy, hi, bobby. - Hi. - Who are you? - My name is barbara. I'm ethan's mother. Your grandmother. - We already have a grandmother. - Yeah, we already have a grandmother. - Kids. - No, no, no, it's all right. It must be quite a shock having a total stranger in your house, huh? Yeah. You see, I've been away for awhile, but I'm hoping to change all that. How would you two like to have some homemade chocolate chip cookies, huh? - Do they have peanuts in them? Bobby's allergic. - That's good to know, but no they're safe, sweetie. - Come on, let's go eat these in your room. Thank you. - Sure. - Mom, I- - let me start. - No, I have something to say to you first. I never meant to shut you out for so long, but I think a lot worse would have happened if I didn't. - I am so sorry that I made it impossible for you to be around me. - That was the hardest time of my life, and lucy's life and it didn't feel like you were listening at all to what we needed from you. - I know what I can be like. And I am just so ashamed of how I acted. You just, you have no idea how much I regret that. I mean, I drove away my only son. I... - Well, if I was still in that other place, we wouldn't be having this conversation. - Right. - But I have kendall and the kids now and what's best for them is best for me. And kendall seems to think you'd be good for us. - Your beautiful fiance was kind enough to try to bridge the gap between us. I missed you so much. And if there's just any chance at all that we could just start fresh, that's what I want. I mean, if it's okay with you? - I would like that too. - thank you. - wow. I still can't believe it. - see, I told you. - Did you hear when she apologized? - Yes, babe, I heard. - And that's not somethin' she woulda done in the past. She always knew best and you'd never convince her otherwise. - Well, she's had a lot of time to think about things. - Thank you for contacting her. - Well, now I have somebody to pump for information about what you were like as a kid. - Oh no, what have I done? Oh, see, now you've opened up the flood gates. She wants to have us over for dinner on Thursday. - Perfect. Oh, by the way, calvin's mom is in town from boston for the weekend and I wanted to have them over for a barbecue. Think your mom could make it? - Are you kidding? Wild horses couldn't keep her away. - ready or not! - Hi. - hey, you made it. - grandma! - Oh, my little munchkins! Oh, I have missed you so much. I made fudge brownies. - Yay! - Oo! - look at you! You are growing like tumbleweeds. - Oh, you excited? - I've grown more than him. - Are you excited? - I take it that's your ex and his mother? - Yes, calvin and jane. - Oh. I didn't realize they'd be coming today. - Of course it's a family barbecue. We're all family, barbara. - You know what I meant was I, I just didn't realize that their father was still in the picture. - Mm, depends on the day. - Oh. - Kenny, beautiful as always. - Congratulations, kenny. We are so happy for you and ethan. - thank you. - I'm ethan's mother, barbara. - Oh. - How are you? - Wonderful to meet you. - Hi. - Looks like we'll be seeing a lot of each other. - Well, we have a lot of planning to do for your wedding and this is all about what you want. I mean, I will be there for you every step of the way. - We haven't even set a date yet. - Well, I can help you with that, too. - Hey, ethan! - Now a spring wedding would be so beautiful. - Moms and weddings. - Yeah, I wonder. - Well, you don't have to worry about her. She can take care of herself. - did everyone have enough to eat? - yes, dear, thank you. - kids, help us clear the table. - oh, barb, just leave it. We can do that. - No, I insist. - I get the biggest one because I'm the oldest. - No fair! - Mm! So good! Are you okay? Bobby? What's happening? Can you breathe? Bobby? Bobby? Help! Help! Bobby? - somebody call 911! It's okay, just breathe. Good. I mean, I haven't seen them in a long time. - We should go. - Bobby's asleep. He's okay. Traumatized but okay. - okay. - I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened. Of course I know about bobby's allergies and I am always so careful- - it's been a long day. I think we all just need to get some rest. - You know, it was an accident, kenny. I'll come by tomorrow, check on the little guy. - I'm sorry. - thank god you were here, barbara. - Oh, of course. Don't mention it. - Really, I don't even wanna think about what coulda happened today. - well, if there's one thing I learned from raising ethan, it was to be constantly vigilant. Heaven knows this guy knew how to get himself in trouble. - Oh, really? - Thank you, mom. - Yeah. I just really look forward to spending more time with you and your family. - Yeah, us too. You're welcome any time. Barbara? Good morning, is everything okay? - Yeah, I made scones this morning and thought why not bring some by for you and the kids? - Oh, thanks, barbara. Wow, that's sweet of you but- - it's my absolute pleasure. How about some tea? - Sure. - Are the kids up yet? - No, they've been with calvin. They won't be home for a little while. - Oh. - You know barbara, I wish you would've called me before you came. - How often are they with calvin? - Well, we have joint custody so they're with their dad about half the time. - Oh, well, it must be kind of a strain for those kids, having to go back and forth all the time. - Calvin and I have had our differences, but he's a great dad and we've worked a lot on our co-parenting skills. So, it's not perfect but this arrangement works for us. - Perhaps you could give me a schedule, you know? So that I'll know for the future. Does calvin live nearby? - How 'bout we'll plan a time for you to see them very soon. - I'm just so sorry that the kids couldn't have those while they were still warm from the oven. - Well, we'll heat 'em up when they get home. You know, thank you so much for dropping by barbara. - Oh yeah, my pleasure. - hm. - Did I hear somebody? - Your mother was just here. - Oh. She's a morning person. - Oh, seriously, ethan? - She's just excited to be a grandma, finally. The novelty will wear off. - if you say so. - I know I'm the one who needed space from her for all those years, but she does come from a good place. I was sick a lot as a child and I don't remember a moment she wasn't at my bedside. I think she just wants to feel like she has a purpose again. - Well, I guess we could use the free babysitting. - You could drop them off there later. Didn't you say you have a ton of work to do? - Hm. - do we have to? I don't even like her. - She saved her brother's life. Please just be on good behavior and watch your little brother. She'll drop you off in like an hour or two. - Two hours? Can I at least have my phone back? - you're dreaming. - Hello, my darlings. - Hi, barbara. Got anymore cookies? - Always. - Bobby. Thank you so much for watching them for a few hours. You're a godsend. - Of course, my dear. Well, come on in. - I gotta take this. Bye guys, be good. Love you. - sweetie, why aren't you eating your lunch? - I'm not hungry. - But if you don't eat your lunch, then you won't get to see your surprise. - Surprise? - What's the surprise? It's all right for someone bobby's age. - Well, I just happen to have another special surprise for you. - oh, thank you, thank you. It's perfect, I love it! - You know what's great about that, it's pretty much a phone. I mean you can call me or text me anytime whenever you need anything. I'm just a click away. You just to have to okay it with your parents. - you don't have to do that. - Why not? - My mom says I spend too much time on my phone and she'll take this away, too. - Oh. Well, so that, it means that I might get in trouble, too. Yeah, I wouldn't want your mom to be mad at me. She might not let you guys come over anymore. But I suppose that, well, we could make it our little secret. - my mom says we don't keep secrets in our family. - No, you're right, it was a bad idea. I'll just take it back to the store. - No, no, no, you don't have to do that. I love it, it can be our little secret. I promise, I won't tell. - Are you sure? I mean only if you say so. - hey, guys. Thank you so much, barbara. - Oh, you're welcome. So, did you get everything done? - Yes. Got all the orders shipped out for the season so I can relax for a minute. - Good. Well, then my surprise comes at the perfect time. - What surprise? - I bought you and ethan a trip to hawaii as an engagement present. I checked the dates with both of your assistants. - Oh my god, barbara. You shouldn't have. - No, it's my pleasure. - Wow, this is next week. We really appreciate it but I don't think- - no excuses. You two deserve this. - Well, I'll have to talk to ethan, but it works out with the kids' schedule. They're supposed to be with calvin next week. - Don't be silly, I'll take them. - Well, it's calvin's week and they have school and every- - I insist. - barbara, he is their dad. - sorry, of course, I... Of course he is. - this is so generous of you. Thank you so much. Come on in, I'll make you some tea. Oh, barbara. Sorry, I thought it was calvin. - I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd just come by and see you two off. - Well, come on in. We're just gettin' ready to leave. Come on, kids, let's go. - hey, kids. - Hey, barbara. - Hey, barbara. - Hey, sweetie. - Mom, what are you doing here? - Oh, just came to say goodbye. - Oh, great. - Can we come with you? - You'll have fun with your dad. - But we love hawaii. - That's funny because you've never been there before. - We saw it on tv once. - Hey. - Hey, kenny. - Ready? Yeah, mm! You ready? Let's grab some burgers from that spartan food truck. Yeah! - I'll miss you. I love you, you be good. - love you, too. - bye now. - Be good. - bam! - you guys have a good time. - thank you. - The man could use a shave and a shower. - Mom. - So, have a safe flight and if you need anything regarding the kids just, I'm a phone call away. - You know, you could take the week off from the kids too, mom. - Oh, I could never get enough of those little angels. You have fun. - Thanks. - Thanks, barbara. - come on, let's go, guys. Eat up. We got a super fun day ahead of us. - well, would you look at that. - Hi, barbara. - Hey, barbara. - You know, after you left I started having a burger craving myself. Anyway, I just wanted to say hello. - No, please, join us, come on. - Maybe I could just stay for a minute. - Do you eat here often? - mm. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm a big believer in supporting local businesses. - yeah? - Oh, oh, oh, no, no! - Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - Oh, gosh! No. Don't wanna stain those nice pants. - No, it's okay. - Let me just- - got it. - You sure? - I think I saw a bathroom on the way over. - Oh, forgive me. - I'll be right back. - I'm a klutz. Kids, do me a favor and just go and see if you can get me some paper towels and clean this up. Thank you. Oh, you darlings. Thank you, thank you, thank you. There we go. - it's fine. - Now you order yourself a new pair and send me the bill. - that's not necessary. - It's the least I could do. Calvin, - yeah? - I know we didn't get off to a good start but anyone who can raise such wonderful children must have some redeeming qualities. - Thank you, I think. - Something wrong, dear? - Oh. Oh, uh, be right back. Oh, god. - yuck! - Oh my. Oh, you poor thing. - Wow. I don't know what happened. I was fine until just now. - You don't think it's a virus? I mean, I hope you're not contagious. - are you gonna be okay, dad? - Of course, dear. I just don't want you guys to get sick. - Yeah, right. - Barbara, do you mind taking bobby and amy just for now? - I would be happy to, of course. - Oh no! - Come on, kids. Come on, let's go, let's go. Okay. You just take all the time you need. Come on. Come on, honey, it's okay. Here we go. - This mac and cheese is a different color than the kind that I had before. - That's because it's homemade. Much better than that processed crap. - You said crap. - Oops. All right, don't tell your mom. It's our little secret. - Our little secret. - I wonder what mom's doing right now. - Why couldn't we go? - Well, I think your mom and ethan just wanted to have some time alone. You two can be quite a handful. - They wanted to get away from us? - Well, when they're married, they're gonna wanna have children, start a family of their own. - They already have us. Why do they want a new family? - I wanted to go to hawaii. - Oh, sweetie. The truth is that I bought that trip for all four of you, but your mom insisted. She just wanted to go at ethan. Oh, speak of the devil. Hello, kendall. - calvin told us what happened. - oh, it was so sudden, that poor man. - He's at home resting but he'll get in to see a doctor as soon as he can. - Right, well, don't worry about the children. I'll take very good care of them. - I know you will, barbara. Calvin would like to pick them up if he starts feeling better. - of course. - Can I say hello? - Oh, you wanna say hello? You know what, dear? This really isn't a good time. They just went to wash up. Why don't you just relax, enjoy your trip. The children and I will be just fine. - Okay, bye. - How are the kids? - Calvin being sick really worked out for your mom. - Let's not think about my mom right now. - all right, you guys have a wonderful day, yeah? Go on. Hello! Bobby. - Barbara. What are you doing here? - Well, I think I made you too small a lunch today. So, I thought you might be hungry. Hm? - It's delicious. - Well, glad you like it. I'll be right back. - Ow! Let go of me you old cow! - Now you listen to me you little piggy, you leave bobby thompson alone or you will be very sorry and if you steal his lunch tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, I just hope you like the taste of poison. Now get outta here and you leave bobby alone. - grandma, you're the coolest. - Oh! - I mean, barbara. - Oh, no, no, no, you can call me grandma. It's okay. Okay? - Thanks, grandma. - mom? Hey guys. - I missed you guys so much. I'm excited to see you. You ready to go? - welcome home. How was your trip? - it was great. - It was very nice. So thoughtful of you, mom, but we're pretty tired so we hoped to grab the kids and go. - But grandma's making brownies. - Barbara, you knew what time we'd be back. - But they asked. - Well, they also asked for a pony. I hope there's not one in the backyard. Come on guys, let's go. - You know, I could drop them off after they eat their brownies. - That's okay, mom. Guys, come on, let's go. - I don't wanna go. - We wanna stay. - Okay, why don't you two go with your mom and ethan and I will bring you some brownies tomorrow? How's that? - Okay. Come on, bobby. - love you, grandma. - Oh, I love you too, sweetie. Okay. - Thanks again for watchin' 'em last minute. - Oh, it was my pleasure. - Little less spoiling would be nice, mom. - That's what grandchildren are for. - see ya later. - bye bye. - hey. - Hey. - What are you doin' up? - I was just thinkin' about tonight, when we picked up the kids. - What? - I'm beginning to think that they like your mother more than me. - Kenny, that's ridiculous. - I know, it sounds stupid when I say it out loud. The way amy looked at me tonight, I just thought they'd be happier to see us, you know? And when I gave her a phone back the other day, she didn't even bat an eyelash. She gets more excited by grandma's baking. - well, grandparents, they don't have to do any of the hard stuff. They never have to spoil any of the fun or make the kids do their homework. But at the end of the day, you are their mother and that surpasses everything. - What if amy and I grow apart like you and barbara did? - Kenny, you are not my mother. And amy is just growing up. I mean, this is all totally normal. - Yeah, but how do I know that for sure? - Well, your mom and dad died when amy and bobby were too young to remember. And calvin's mom is barely around. This is your first experience with grandparents. So, just gotta trust me. It's not you. - I love you. - I love you, too. Mom. - Are the kids here? Bobby, amy? Oh. - grandma! - grandma! - I thought I would take you two to railroad park today to see the trains. What do you think? - All right! - I wish you had called me first. - Please? - Please? - Please? - Okay, go before I change my mind. - Yes! - come on, grandma. - Don't let them have too many sweets, and have them back before dark, please. - I used to bring ethan here. - can we go over there? - Honey, we can go wherever you want. - hey, ethan. - Hey. Oh, shoot. - Kendall forget to tell you I was comin' by today? - Yeah, no, she told me. I... It just totally slipped my mind. - No worries, yeah. Well, if you just grab 'em, we'll be out. - Yeah, I'm afraid they're not here. Yeah, my mom has 'em. She picked 'em up about an hour ago. - Okay. - Yeah. - All right. Well, cool. Well, I'm happy she's enjoying spending time with them, but I had plans today. I needed to talk to them about something. Where are they? - They're at the railroad park with the trains. Listen, I'm really sorry, calvin. This is totally my fault. - No worries, man. I'll just swing by there and pick 'em up. - All right. - Cool. Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - that looks good. There's the train again. Hi, it's barbara anders here. Leave a message. - mom, hey, calvin's comin' to pick up the kids. Please, don't make a big deal out of it. - when can we ride on the trains? - Grandma, are you taking pictures? - oh, you know what? I forgot all about that. Let me just... okay. Ready? And one, two, three. One more. Perfect. Come here, come and see this. See how everything's in the background? Isn't that crazy? - It had to be the last place I looked. - Dad, why are you here? - Barbara I had plans to be with the kids this afternoon. - Oh. - Come on. We need to go, now. - But we haven't seen everything yet. - Calvin, I do apologize. I had no idea. Kids you just go with your dad and I'll see you later tonight. - No, no they won't. They'll be with me tonight. - But I have tickets for the "harry potter" play. It was supposed to be a surprise but your father ruined it. - Okay, all right. Kids, come on, we gotta go. Let's go, come on. - No, we wanna ride the train. - There'll be trains in boston. - What is that supposed to mean? - It's none of your business. Who even are you? These aren't your children. They're not your grandchildren. They're not your concern. Just leave us alone, okay? Come on. - Why are you being mean to her? - can we see "harry potter?" - I have never been more embarrassed in my whole life. - Mom, I tried to warn you he was coming. If only you had answered your phone- - well, what difference would that have made? Oh, your ex just ruined the kid's fun at the park today. - I know, calvin called me. - He could have waited to take them instead of causing such a scene. - Mom, what's done is done. - What, and you're gonna let him get away with it? - Well, what are we supposed to do? He's their father. - Yeah, and I'm their grandmother. - I should have been more careful with the dates, okay? If you're gonna be upset with someone, be upset with me. - It's nobody's fault. These things happen. - And I'm still getting used to how this all works. - Look, this is probably not the best time to tell you this but- - to tell us what? - Calvin was offered a top position with his company in boston, and he plans on taking it. - What does this mean for the kids? - He wants the three months that they're not in school over the summer. I'm not gonna fight him on it. He's their father. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Calvin, calvin can't do that. I will hire the best attorney that money can buy. Those kids belong here with us. Spending time with those precious angels, that means the world to me. Those children are my top priority now. - And they love spending time with you too, barbara, but they need to spend more time with their dad. - ethan is their dad. - Mom, you'll still be able to see them whenever... - hello, calvin, it's barbara. Don't, don't hang up. I think that we need to work things out for the sake of your children. Oh, I am so glad that you agree. Yeah. Do you think you could find time to stop by here this afternoon? I'd just like to get your input on what my boundaries should be with the kids. Wonderful. Mm hm. 'kay, I'll see you then. Calvin. - Hey. - How nice to see you. Please come in. - Okay. We're gonna have to make this quick because I'm on my way to the airport. I'm going to boston to check out some apartments. - I can see why you might have reservations about me, but I only want what's best for those kids. - hm. - I've been baking. Won't you join me in the kitchen? - Okay. It smells delicious. - my crowd pleasing apple pie. - Hm. - An old family recipe. Would you like a piece? - Sure. - There are two things that I am very good at and that's real estate and baking. There you go. - Thank you. Mm. Oh, you ain't lying. That's some good stuff right there. Wow, mm. Wow. - So, kendall tells me you'll be moving to boston and you wanna keep the kids three months of the year. - Well, I don't wanna move, but the job offer's just too good to pass up. - But those are the months they're gonna want to have fun. They won't have school all day. Don't you think that they'd rather stay here? - I'm from boston. There are a lot of things for kids to do in the summertime and it's a good opportunity for them to spend time with my mom. - Hm. - But what about their friends? Kids their age can be very emotionally damaged if you take them away for long periods of time. Don't you want them to turn into well-rounded adults? - oh, sorry. I think they'll learn how to make new friends. - Oh. Well, you just have an answer for everything don't you? Well, so do I. - you and that phone. - I need to unwind before going to sleep. - Well, I know a better way to unwind. - Oh you do, do you? - Mm hm. All right, let's make a new rule. No more taking phone calls while we're in bed. - Agreed. But after I take this one. Hello? Hi, jane. What's wrong? No, I haven't heard from him. I'm sure everything's okay. Yeah, I'll let you know if we hear from him. Okay. Bye. Calvin stood up his mom for dinner. - well, I'm sure there's nothin' to worry about. It's calvin. He's not the most reliable person on the planet. - "hi, beautiful. I'm on a date. I'll call my mom, sorry." - see? Told ya. - it doesn't bother you that I worry about my ex does it? - Of course not. I know how important it is that he's in the kids' lives. - Look, I know that this boston thing is tough, but it's a really big opportunity for him. - Yeah. I know what it's like to worry about an ex. I sometimes think about lucy. I hope she's doin' okay. - I get it. But don't expect me to arrange that reunion for you 'cause I don't want you all to myself. - Oh, she's puttin' the phone away. - I am, I'm puttin' the phone away. You see that? - Uh oh, I'm goin' for it. - Yeah, yeah? - While I can. Hey, almost ready to go. Bobby forgot his jacket at barbara's. - Oh, no worries. I'll stop by at some point today and pick it up. - Great. All right, see you tonight. - okay. - she isn't home. Yeah, she left a few minutes ago as I pulled in. - Do you happen to know where she went? - No, I'm sorry. We're not exactly close. - Oh. Well, you can speak freely. I don't really know her that well. - Why are you here to see her? - My husband and I are considering her for a childcare position. - okay, when we moved in, my husband and I thought she was the sweetest lady. So, when we came in need of a nanny, barb offered. - Really? - Yeah, and she was great at first. Once she even saved our daughter's life. Our youngest has a sesame seed allergy and she ate some and well, thank goodness barb was there. - Can I ask you, did barbara know that your daughter was allergic to sesame seeds? - Yes. That's why she knew to use the epipen. Thank goodness she did but she became obsessive. She would come over unannounced a lot and, yeah, I swear she was starting to turn our kids against us. After we finally fired her, we got a visit from child services, an anonymous call. Anonymous my ass. - ethan? - In the kitchen. Hey, I thought I would cook us dinner tonight. - I need to talk to you about your mother. - What is it now? - I spoke to her neighbor today. Did you know that barb was their nanny for a short time? - No, I didn't, but it doesn't surprise me. You know much of my mother loves kids. - When I went to pick up bobby's jacket, barb wasn't there but patty had some interesting information. - We already know my mom's vinegar not honey. - When they let her go she called child services on them out of spite. Does that seem rational? - Maybe she had a good reason. I mean, you don't know these neighbors or how they are as parents. - Then there was this thing with a sesame seed allergy. Ethan, do you think your mother would intentionally harm our kids so she could look like a hero? - What are you talking about? That's insane, okay? My mother would never in a million years- - yeah, but ethan, you once told me that as a child you were sick a lot and your mother would take care of you. - No, that's enough, kendall. Okay, are you even listening to yourself right now? I know more than anyone how overbearing my mother can be but this person you're picturing can't be real. - She's spending too much time with the kids. I feel like I barely even know them anymore. - That's not my mom's fault is it? - What is that supposed to mean? - Well, if you didn't spend so much time on your phone or sendin' emails, maybe you'd have a little more time for the kids. - That's not fair. I work really hard to make sure amy and bobby never feel like I'm not there for them and they never did until your mother got here. - I'm sorry. Okay? I just mean my mom would never hurt the kids. She loves them. - I don't want her around them anymore. - Well, that's a little rash don't you think? She's a good grandma. The kids seem to think so. I mean, should we really be the ones to make that decision for them? - But you're forgetting one important thing. They're my kids. Not yours. - ethan. Come in. - Hey, mom. - I'm sure you'll work things out. - I said some things I shouldn't have. - Well, we all do that sometimes and once kendall has a chance to calm down, you can tell her that. - I just don't know where her head is at right now. - But I'll still get to see the kids this weekend, right? - Mom, have you been listening to anything I've been saying? It's highly doubtful. - But kendall can't do that. Those kids are part of our family. - Let's just give her some space. - You need to tell me what caused this. - Something your neighbor said about you calling child services. Is that true? - of course not. - It had better not be. If I find out I let you back in my life just to lose everything again, I... - hello, patty. - how did you get it? - I know where you keep your spare key. - what do you want? - I'll thank you to keep your nose out of my family's business from now on. - I don't know what you're talking about. - My future daughter-in-law through ethan out because of what you told her. - I didn't know she was your daughter-in-law. - You wanted to punish me. - I didn't tell her anything except the truth. - you will fix this, or I will make sure that your kids are taken away for good. Okay? - barbara. - I'd like to talk to you about ethan. - look, I don't think it's a good idea. - No, no, please, please. I feel like this is all my fault and it's a beautiful day. Can we just go for a walk? - Okay. Sure. - I did not call child services on patty and will. - I know, patty reached out. - I mean, I'm ashamed that I even threatened to, but I was just, I was so attached to their kids and then when they let me go, I'm afraid that my heart just shattered. Kendall, I love you and the kids as if you were my own. And ethan has never felt about anybody, the way that he feels about you, not even lucy. I just, I can't live with myself knowing the pain that I've caused you both. - I appreciate that, barbara, but I just need you to understand that I need some time. My kids mean everything to me and I need to make sure I'm doing right by them. - I understand. - Sorry. Jane? What's wrong? Where? Do they know anything? Call me if you find out anything else, okay? I'm heading home. Okay. - What is it, dear? What? - The police found calvin's body. He had an accident. - Oh no. - He's dead. - Oh, no. Do they know what happened? - No, I don't know. - Here sweetie, take this. Let's get you home, come on. - thank you for coming. Take care. Buddy. - Mom? - Yeah? - Can I go be with dad like the minister said? - No, you have to die first. - Amy. Bobby, your dad would want you to live a long and happy life before you reunite with him. - I miss him now. - I know you do. It's okay to miss him. I'll miss every time I look at you two. - I miss him, too. - hey. - Hey. - Hey. - hey, you two. I missed you so much. - but why didn't you come and see us? - Oh, it's not like I didn't want to. I promise. - I think your mother just really wanted to have some special time with you. - we missed you, ethan. - We missed you too, grandma. - Oh, sweetie, me too. - We wanted to come to the service but thought it might not have been appropriate. - Why don't you two come with me? I have cookies. - I'm so sorry. - I know you are. - I should have acted differently. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you and the kids. - Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I acted so irrationally. There was so much going on, I felt like I was losing my babies. - And I'm sorry, too. I just want us to be a family again. - I think I made amends with your mom. - You made up with her before you made up with me? - she's a strong woman and so am I. We're gonna clash sometimes. But there's one thing that we both have in common. We both love you and the kids very much. I missed you. - I have to go into the office soon. I'm listing a lovely mid-century modern. - I can't remember the last time we had lunch, just the two of us. - It's ironic that I see the kids now less than I did before you and kendall were married. - Mom, you see them all the time. And you have to respect that kendall still has a lot of feelings about that. - No, I just thought that by now she'd understand that I just want what's best for those kids. I feel like she's punishing me for something I haven't done. - Mom, nobody's punishing you. The kids can't be at two places at once and sometimes believe it or not, kendall wants to spend time with them, too. - Well, while we're on the subject, there is something I wanted to talk to you about. - What's that? - I spoke with my friend, harvey, the attorney. And now that you and kendall are married, he thought it would be best if you legally adopted the kids, just in case something happened to kendall. - Mom. - No. Well, nothing's gonna happen to her of course, but you can never be too prepared. What if calvin's parents wanted to seek custody? Are you willing to take that chance? - We were going to get to the adoption piece eventually, but maybe you're right. If we get to it sooner, it's one less thing to worry about later. - Exactly. I'll just give harvey a call. - do you have to leave again? - It's just an overnight business trip. - But what if he doesn't come back like last time? - First off I did end up coming back didn't I? Plus, I'm a married man now and I just signed a bunch of papers saying I'm officially your dad. - You promise you'll come back tomorrow? - I promise. Cross my heart. - And you won't even have time to miss him because grandma wants you to come over tonight for a sleepover. - Oo, sounds like more fun than I'll be havin'. All right guys, grab your things for grandma's. I'll drop you off. - they adore you. I guess that means I have to keep you. - I guess that means I have to stay. Bye. - Bye. Love you. - Love you, too. - Drive safe. - My little angels. Oh, we are gonna have so much fun. - Thanks for taking them tonight. Kendall's been feeling a little under the weather. So, some alone time will do her good. - Well, you know you can always leave them with me. - Thank you. I'll see you when I get back. - Have a safe trip. - Bye, guys. - bye. - can we really sleep in the tent tonight? - Yes you can. Now run up and lay out your sleeping bags. - grandma we're hungry. - Apple pie! - No, no, no, sweetheart. I made this one especially for your mother to help her feel better. - But it smells so good. - But you know that too many sweets before bed are not good for you. But you're both so perfect that I'll let you have one cookie each. Okay, now go up and get in your tent and I'll come up and tell you a story. - barb, it's harvey. Congratulations on the adoption and officially becoming a grandma. I would love to see you again. How 'bout dinner? - hi, barbara. Are the kids okay? - Oh, they're fine. And they want me to read them a scary story before bed. - just don't make it too scary. - of course. Ethan tells me that you haven't been feeling well lately. - Oh, it's nothing. - Well, I feel bad knowing that you're in that house all alone under the weather. Why don't you come over here and spend the night? - Oh, that's sweet of you but I don't wanna impose. - No, it's no imposition. I would love to have your company. And with ethan gone, well, we could get to know each other better. - Sure. I'll be right over. - Wonderful. - Okay, bye. - this is ethan. Leave me a message. - hey, babe. I'm gonna spend the night at your mom's, but call me as soon as you get this. I love you. - "the children were scared. They heard noises outside the tent. Oo, the footsteps got closer. Thump, thump, thump, thump. What could it be?" - I don't know. - I bet it's a bear. Roar! I scared you. - Did not! - All right, do wanna hear the rest of this or not? "the rustling got louder and louder. The intruder was near. The children huddled together as they watched the flap of the tent. And suddenly, someone came in. The children screamed but it wasn't a lion or a bear. It was something else entirely." - what was it? - It was their grandmother who had come and brought them some freshly baked cookies so that they wouldn't go to sleep hungry. You like that? Okay. That's enough for one night. Time for sleep. Oh, I love you. Mwah. Goodnight, sweetie. Sweet dreams. - hello? - hello, is this kendall anders? - Yes it is, how can I help you? - kendall, sweetheart. This is detective eastwood with the homicide division. I'm calling in regards to your late husband. - I'm sorry, detective, can you repeat that again? I'm calling regarding your late former husband. - Calvin? Yeah, how can I help you? - we got back as autopsy report and have reason to believe calvin's death was not an accident. - What do you mean? The toxicology report found traces of rodenticide. - What is that? - rat poison. - rat poison? Why am I only hearing about this now? Well, it can take some time for autopsy reports to be completed, especially when no foul play was suspected. And as you know, his body was burned in the accident and that made things more complicated. Are you there ms. Anders? - Yeah, yeah. It's just a lot to take in. Would you mind coming down to the station tomorrow to answer a few questions? - Of course. Yeah, of course. I'll be there first thing. - thank you. We'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - is everything okay? - Yes, just some work stuff. The kids asleep? - Yeah, I think I wore them out. - Well, that's hard to do. - It's such a chilly night. How about a cup of tea and a slice of apple pie? I just baked one. - Sure, that sounds great. Thank you. - When I was pregnant with ethan, I had really had my heart set on a little girl. I mean, I love my son but, I was never able to conceive again. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, no, don't be. You're my daughter now. And you have given me the greatest gift that anyone possibly could, two wonderful grandchildren. - I wasn't planning on telling anyone until I talked to ethan, not even the kids but I'm pregnant, and we weren't planning on having anymore. It just sorta happened. - don't eat that! It's not good for the baby, all the refined sugar. - I don't plan on giving up sugar, barbara. - No, no, no, of course not but, well, my pie has just way too much of it. - I plan on making my own dietary decisions while I'm pregnant. - I can't believe it. Ethan is gonna be so thrilled. Of course not as thrilled as I am but... Okay, let's get you to bed. You need your rest. - I think I'll do some reading before I go to sleep. - why don't you have a nice bath? There are fresh towels in the guestroom. - just one cookie and then we'll go to bed. - Or how 'bout that? It smells so good. - Okay, but just a small piece and be quiet. Bobby, that's too much. - amy, bobby, wake up. - What's wrong, grandma? - You need to take this medicine right now. - Medicine? No way. I'm not even sick. - All right, do what grandma says. - What is going on in here? - Take it, jason! - I'm not jason. What are you doing? - Barbara, let go of him. Come here, honey. - why are you trying to make him vomit? You need to tell me what is going on right this instant. - Okay, they ate some of my pie and if they don't drink that they're gonna be sick. - We didn't eat any pie. - we were going to but bobby dropped the plate. - Are you telling the truth? You didn't eat any? - Not a bite, I swear. - Calm down, calm down, barbara. Why would they get sick off of your pie? - Oh, well... I found out that the eggs were expired and I threw them out of course but it was after the fact and I'm just, oh, I'm just, I'm so confused. I just... - Okay. Okay. All right. Kids, you stay here, okay? Come on, let's get you back to bed. - Thank you, thank you, dear. - you didn't see her, ethan. She was acting crazy. Bobby has bruises on his arms from where she grabbed him. No, no, no, no, I don't want you driving home tonight. We'll leave first thing in the morning. Yeah, okay. I love you, too. All right, bye. - what are you doing? - did you put this in the pie? That's why you didn't want us to eat it? - I didn't mean any harm. The kids were supposed to have any. - But I was, until I told you I'm pregnant. This is rat poison, barbara. - Oh, no, you're mistaken. - You killed calvin. - No, no. Put the phone away, kendall. - You've lost your mind. - I said, put it away. - Oh! - 911, what's your emergency? Ma'am, are you there? - You would really kill your own grandchild? - Oh, you're making me do this. I mean, why couldn't you just leave things alone? - you don't have to hurt anybody else. - I mean, it was bad enough when that doctor let my jason die and then lucy, I mean, she wouldn't even consider adoption. And she certainly didn't want to have another child but then I had bobby and amy and... Well, I couldn't let calvin move them across the country. - You're a monster. - I will not live without them. Now, ethan's just gonna have to find someone else. - grandma? - oh no, you're... - No! Run! - Let me go. - go, get out! - let go of me! - Stay away from them! - Let go of me! - we have a 1057. Shorts fired in the richmond area. - unit 428 on the way. - look, it doesn't matter if you get rid of me too. They saw you. They'll never forgive you. - Oh. They love me. - If you shoot me, barbara, you will never see those kids again. Ever. What are you doing? Barbara? - I told you, I won't live without them. - Barbara, don't want to do this. Put it down. Don't do this. Barbara. Don't do this. Don't do this. You don't wanna do this. - Put the gun down, put it down. Now. Put it down now, drop it. - put it down. - 337 roger lane. On the address, 18607, that's seven 01. - are you all right ma'am? - Where are my kids? - Don't worry, they're safe. Follow me. - she's here. - Yeah, she's really here. - what a beautiful baby girl. - Thank you, doctor. - I'll leave you some time to get better acquainted. - Would you mind letting our kids in on your way out? - yeah, sure. - Thank you. - hey you, two. Don't be shy. - Meet your little sister, sarah. - what do you makin', barb? - Oh, it's a sweater for my new granddaughter. - It's lovely. - Yeah, I prefer knitting but, you know, the needles. - If you make a little something for my nephew, maybe I could help you out with that. - You know, I think this is my best work yet. Oh, she is gonna look so adorable in this. - I'm sure the parents will love it. - Yeah, I'm sure they will.
