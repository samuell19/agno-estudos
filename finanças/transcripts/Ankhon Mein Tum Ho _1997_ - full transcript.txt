What happened? Mother has been taken to the hospital I don't know what has happened to her. But Pratap a contract for two hundred crores. It is very necessary to meet the ministry. Uncle... What about two hundred crores? There isn't anything more important than mother. Mother... - Pratap... Mother... what happened to you mother? Why were you brought to the hospital suddenly? When did you come? I came right now. But what happened to you? Nothing has happened to me I am all right. Then... why are you here? Reputed doctors were here in conference. I thought that it was a good chance. I'd have the queen mother checked up. I brought here last night. The check up is done. We are going home now. What did the doctors say? Mr. Pratap. We have checked your mother. We have to say it with sorrow. Your mother's case is very complicated. She has a very weak heart. Then, she has diabetes, condylitis... ...and she has chronic arthritis too. Due to this... She can never be able to walk without a wheelchair. Can't you do anything for her cure? Frankly, we can't do anything. It is not advisable for her... ...to undergo heart surgery. We cannot operate on her heart. But our medicines can lessen her pain. Actually... She is living on her own self strength. None will say that she is ill if they look at her She is a very brave lady. Yes. What will we have to do? Nothing All we can suggest you is... ...to keep her as happy as you can. She can eat whatever she wants. And she can do what ever she wants. Because she doesn't have much time. Even a small sorrow can kill her. Yes. Stop it. Stop it. You go. Go. What happened, mother? Mother... I am very ill. - What? There is no chance for cure. You are responsible for this. What did I do, mother? - What did I do, mother?! Why don't you marry? Marriage again! Come on. I will take you on a walk. What happened, mother? Mother, oh mother. You aren't talk at all. I told you that l won't talk to you. Till the time you don't accept marriage... ...I won't speak to you. What can I do, mother? I don't like any girl at all. Come here and sit down. What did you say? What did you say? Mother, I don't like any girl Do you not like any girl... ...or do you have an affair with some girl? No mother. Mother, actually... When a wife marries and comes to her husband's house... ...she becomes the reason for her husband's mother's sorrows. And I cannot do anything... ...which troubles you. Wow. My son is so intelligent He doesn't want to give any trouble to his mother. But he has kept her away from all happiness. How come? See! Every mother has an ambition. When will her son marry? And bring a beautiful daughter-in-law. There is cheer in the house. They have a lot of children. And the whole house should echo with their sounds. The queen sister is correct. When will he marry if not now? Silly boy. Okay, mother. Then the girl which you like, who can serve you... ...bring such girl, I'll marry her... - Good. Mohanlal. - Yes. Bring a few photographs of good looking and decent girls. I want to have Pratap married very quickly. - Ok. Mohanlal, all of them look so ugly. You mean, I'll have to marry all of them? All of them are useless. You are useless too. What have I done now, mother? You've become like a camel. You haven't found a girl of your kind?! You had the need of a daughter-in-law. Now you find one for yourself. I'm going for work. - Where are you going? Mother I'm going. I'll meet you in the evening. - Listen to me! All of this is worthless. Useless. Hey! This girl is very beautiful. Wow, Pooja, the new singing sensation. "Tell me, sir." "Tell me..." "What's my fault in this?" "Tell!" "My eyes are intoxicating." "Look!" "There's pride in my speech." "Think!" - "I do know that" "something has happened." "I do know that" "something has happened." My God! Mayank! What a girl! "Everyone says that" "the girl has come of age." "Everyone says that" "the girl has come of age." "Everyone says that" "the girl has come of age." "I'm tired of hearing it." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." Wow! Look at her. What a face! "They send flowers." "Write letters in vain." "Some ask me to accept their heart." "Oh youth!" "Oh youth!" "Beloved, I fear I might commit a sin." "The world feels feverish." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." "I'm tired of hearing it." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." "Oh youth!" "Oh youth!" "I think all day and night." "When my wedding procession will arrive!" "Fulfill the rituals and leave with my beloved." "How do I tell my father, the desires of my heart? "My life is in trouble." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." - Superb! "I'm tired of hearing it." "Everyone says that the girl has come of age." Hey, look ahead too. Here, have a look. Wow! Look ahead! - Sorry! Dead! You crashed the car now. You crashed against my car. This is... This is the same girl whom we saw on TV. 100 percent, she is the same girl. Can't you see and drive? You crashed against our car. I asked you something You are just staring at me? When I saw my friend, the beauty, I was so excited. It was the mistake of the eyes. The dagger was thrust in the heart. Wow, lawyer. You became a poet. Thank you. - Mister, you've made my friend lose her car. And instead of accepting your mistake, you are going on saying poems? I salute such a beautiful mistake. And come on this matter, I give my heart and mind in your name. It is useless to impress her with poems. You'll have to pay the loss to the car. - Ok! See. I'll pay this loss of yours. But who will repay my loss? What has happened to your car? It is all right. It is this car which has been crushed. That is the biggest problem. The wound that isn't seen from outside that wound is always very deep. Yes. However. Tell me, what is the loss amount? I'll give you a cheque. Will this cheque of yours bounce? See, it is such here that even if one gives the heart, it doesn't come back. Then how can the cheque come back? Anyway, you tell me. What is your name, sister? Sister? Who is the sister? I mean you. Who else? Because I cannot call her a sister. Because I'm related to her with the other relation of seven births. Isn't it? Just a minute. When did we meet before this? Just ten minutes ago. Actually, I'd seen you on TV. And I just kept staring. I don't know how many years passed as I kept seeing and... This seems to be love at first sight. Love? I don't even want to see your face. Our thoughts are so similar! I myself don't want to see my face. It is your face which is watch able Wow! Now, I'll see your face day and night. This person seems to be someone crazy. Come on. Let us run away. - Yes, come on. I'm crazy? See. Please listen. Pooja! What a name? As is the form, so is the name. You're my goddess and I'm your devotee. Grandpa you! This... Son, are you whistling? The queen of my dreams, when will you come? Have you liked some girl or something? You are absolutely right, grandpa. But how did you know that? When I was in college I used to look at beautiful girls and used to whistle. You too? Why? Don't I've a heart? Okay. Tell me, Is that girl beautiful? Beautiful? She is extremely beautiful. Show her to me too. I'm very much interested in seeing beautiful girls. What is this, grandpa? At least think about your age. You've become old now. Can't you understand? You must be old. Yours father. Here you are. Look at these muscles. This teak wood. Great! Tell me whether the whistle is like yours or not. Well... Don't know... If you don't know, then find it out. And if she doesn't whistle. Make her whistle. And when both of you start whistling come to me. - You?! And I'll blow your marriage trumpets. Grand father you are great Fantastic. Then why are you wasting time? Go. I'll go and come back quickly. - Go quickly. One shouldn't delay. "My name is Chin Chin Chu." "A moonlit night, you and me. Hello mister, how do you do?" Cut it. Good shot, Pooja. Hello! - You? Yes. Who permitted you to come here? - Permission? See, madam. When the heart gives permission then there isn't any other permission needed. See. You are wasting your time. - On the contrary. I think, madam. I've never utilized time better. What do you want, after all? I want to have my life made. Minutes from you. That's it. What do you mean? I mean, in these three minutes, I'll ask you a couple of questions. And as soon as I get the answers to them I'll run away like the Indian cricket team. - Ask me. Am I blind? - What? I asked you, am I blind? No. Am I ugly? No. - Thank you. Am I leper? Do I've any illness? No. It doesn't seem like that. Do you love someone else? No. It isn't anything like that. When it is isn't anything like that and there isn't anything wrong with me, what is your problem in thinking on my request? This is my heart. This is my bill. My request. This is a blank paper. That is what I wanted to tell you. Till the time you don't emboss your acceptance on this blank paper this crazy man will wait for your acceptance from six in the morning tomorrow.

Sister! If you'd look at these papers. Forget the papers and look at this first. Isn't she beautiful? - Very beautiful. Forget everything and find out about her first. Yes. - Here! Prem. I'm scared sometimes. Scared? About what? You are so rich and I'm so poor. You move around in big cars and me... What if your grandfather... - Grandfather! Oh god! The truth is, Pooja. Even I'm very scared of grandpa. If he says no because of some reason then it is impossible to make him say yes. Do you think that he will say no? Look, I don't know. He can refuse too. So what will we do now? What is to be done now? See. I've loved you. I'll love you all life. But Pooja... Marriage. I'll have to do it according to grandpa's wishes. What?! You'll love me and marry someone else? Yes. I'm helpless. I can't refuse Grandpa. I can't refuse Grandpa. Coward. Coward? Who is a coward? Me? You don't know my Grandpa. He is very strict. Yes. So, you become strict too. Tell him straight away. Grandpa. I love Pooja and I want to marry her. - That's it. It is such a simple matter. It is such a matter! It is not so simple. Okay, if you were in my place would you've told this to Grandpa? Why? I would have told him immediately. Think about it. Would you've told him? I would have told him. Of course. Then tell him. What do you mean? This means that grandpa has called you at home. What? - Yes. Oh! Grandpa! - Yes. See who has come. Come, daughter. - Pooja. Greetings, Grandpa. - Enough. This is something. You are the one with the eyes of a deer. You are another form of beauty, Looking at you, I'm slipping What is this? Are you like this from now only? Shut up! Tell me first. Why didn't you meet me fifty years ago? Yes. I meant to say, where were you fifty years ago? I wasn't born at that time. - That's good. Or else I would have kidnapped and he would be left just like that. You are a lucky boy. - Thank you very much. Thank your stars! Take out an auspicious day quickly. We've to marry as soon as possible. Grandpa, you don't have to marry. You've to get me married. Yes. Why do you think that I can't marry? Grandpa, why do you forget that you've become old now? Oh shut up! Your father's father must be old. Greetings, Mr. Kapoor. Here. Speak of the devil. - And the devil is here. I was passing from here. And I thought that I'd pay you a visit. - That's good. Tell me. Why were you remembering me? Shastri, this boy wishes to marry this girl. Look at the two. How is the couple? - It is very good. Then take out an auspicious occasion quickly. Daughter, do you've any birth chart? I don't know if I've it or not. It doesn't matter. I'll look at the hand and prepare the birth chart. - Ok! You make the birth chart and you come with me now. - Where, grandpa? You come with me. I've work with you. Come, child. Sister, this is our Deendayal's daughter. Who is Deendayal? - Our cashier. Whose hand was severed in an accident? You opened up a shop for him after that. - Oh yes! He is a very good man. - Yes, sister. Mohanlal Go and tell him that I want to meet him. - Right. Whom do you wish to meet, mother? Her father. She seems so beautiful. You look at it. Your choice is my choice. Yes. All say that before the marriage. Shastri, what is the problem? Why are you so upset? This marriage cannot take place. But why can't it take place? Understand that this girl is inauspicious. Inauspicious? How can she be inauspicious? She'll commit a murder. What are you saying? Her husband will be murdered. She will be widowed in the first year of marriage. Do you wish to say that she will kill her husband? She will surely do it. Have you seen it properly? Yes. I've seen it many times. The planetary language never lies. Don't agree to this marriage. Greetings! I don't accept any horoscope or anything. I just know this much, Grandpa. If I don't marry listening to the priest I'll repent it all through my life. Because Grandpa I can't live with Pooja. I can't live. Son! Do you think that my heart won't cry looking at you so sad? Son, if after you marry, what the priest said rings true then our family line will be over for ever. Grandpa, the family line will be over if I don't marry Pooja. Son. You know that I don't love anyone as... ...much I do in this whole wide world. And in front of my eyes. I can't even think about it. Prem I won't let this marriage take place. I won't let it take place. - I say too, Grandpa. If I'm married, I'll marry only Pooja. Whatever be the case. No. Prem! Come, daughter. Daughter. From that faraway mountain to where you are standing, all this area belongs to me. But fifty years ago. When I came here. I didn't have anything. I didn't even have a apartment to live. But I met the priest and I befriended him. I did whatever he told me to do. Money and success all due to him. Whatever I'm today. I'm all that just because of him. Whatever he said. All has rung out to be true. He has seen your hand too. Did he tell you anything? No. He told me that he will tell everything about me to you. Yes. He has told me a lot about you. Due to which. I was forced to bring you here. What has he told? Whatever he has told it is possible that you won't be able to hear it. Is it something bad? Something? Not something. It is very bad. Please tell me whatever it is. I want to know everything. Child! He has told that you are inauspicious. Your hands will commit a murder. Your husband will be killed. And you'll be widowed within a year. Your priest wants to say that I'm a murderer? I'll murder my husband? And that I'll be widowed within a year? This is the meaning of his forecast, isn't it? Yes. Daughter. Grandpa. Fire and water can befriend each other. The sun can rise from the east. The mountain Himalaya can fly like dry leaves. But Pooja will never kill her husband. She will never do anything in life which will make her feel low in her own eyes. Daughter! I wish that whatever you say be the truth. But I'm scared. It is twenty years to this day. Even though the priest dissuaded me I sent my son and his wife to. a foreign country on business matters. Their plane crashed and both of them died. I hold myself responsible for that to this day. And I decided that I'll never do anything without the priest's permission. He told me to make Prem a lawyer he become very famous. Even though I had so much money, I made him a lawyer. Pooja. Prem is my only son. I gave him whatever he wanted till date. But today, even though he knows everything, he is ready to marry you. But I don't want to take this risk. Now you can save him. But what can I do? You can refuse this marriage. Grandpa, without Prem. Pooja, if you really love him you'll have to refuse this marriage. What the priest has forecasted can be false too. And if it is the truth even you'll lose him and I'll lose him too. Please save him. I beg of you for Prem. Please give me this alms. Okay. Wherever he be, let him be happy. May he live long! I'll go away from his life. Daughter. I know that I'm giving you too much pain. But this. I'll never forget this all through my life. Tell me. Tell me what you want. I'll give you whatever you want. Tell me. Who has begged of me and taken my happiness, my love and my everything. What will he give me? What will he give me? Daughter! For what are you punishing me, god? How have I hurt you? Hello? Hello! Pooja! What has happened to you? Come on, Pooja. Get down. Come on, get down. What are you doing? - Didn't I tell you to get down? Why are you creating this ruckus? - I'll create a ruckus if you don't come with me silently. Come on. Come on. - Let me go. Here you are. Get down. Come on. Didn't you hear it? Come on. What is this way of bringing me? What else could I have done? I called up your place, you didn't talk to me. I went to meet you at your office you didn't come to meet me too. I didn't have any other way to talk to you. Tell me. What do you want to tell me? You know what I want to tell you. Why did you stop meeting me? You can say that, I've had enough. Love is dead. - Don't talk nonsense Pooja. Our love cannot die so easily. Why don't you tell me clearly? That Grandpa told you about the priest's forecast. And he has forced you not to meet me. Even if he has done like this, what's wrong in it? He doesn't wish that I should marry you and become the reason for your ruination. What nonsense, Pooja? Can anyone believe that you'll kill your husband? Whether anyone believes it or not. And your Grandpa believes in it. Your priest believes in it. But I don't believe in all this. All I know is that I wish to marry you, that's it. But I don't want to marry you. - What? This is my decision. Okay, Pooja. Listen to what I say too. I've loved you for the first and last time in life. If I marry, you'll be my bride and none else. This is my decision. Pooja. What are you doing? If I don't take your blessings whose blessings will I take? If you hadn't helped me after my hand being cut, then me and my daughter would be begging I think. Sit down. - Yes. Tell me. What is the order for me? Not an order. I want to ask you for something. I can do anything for you, queen mother. I want my son Pratap to marry your daughter Pooja. What are you saying? We are very small people. Why are you saying like this? Wealth doesn't make a man big or small. Tell me. Will you give me your daughter? What will be better for me than this? This poor men's daughter will become you daughter-in-law. I want to have this marriage quickly. You please don't about this once. Whether she has some problems about this. What problems can she Have about this? Queen mother. She is getting heaven on earth. I don't want any heaven. I don't want to marry now. - Why? Daughter, I don't know what you wish. But we've to do something the queen mother's happiness. The queen mother, who has given us so much she has asked us for something for the first time. Please don't say no to her. Child, don't say no to her. I beg of you. Greetings. I'm Pooja. You are just like how I thought you to be. Come. Have a seat. Radha! - Yes. Bring some sweets. - Yes. Pooja! If you come to this house, monsoon will come with you. This home will turn into a paradise. It can be wrong too. Why do you say like this? I don't say this. The astrologers say this. What do the astrologers say? They say that I'm inauspicious and unworthy. The house in which I go, it will be ruined. I'll commit a murder. My husband will be killed within a year of marriage. And I'll turn a widow. Which astrologer told you all this rubbish? He is a very big astrologer. Whatever he as said has never gone wrong. What is his name? The priest Divyadrishti Shastri. Did you forecast about this girl? - Yes. You mean whatever you said is true. - It is true. Looking at Pooja's face, do you think that she can do anything wrong? Queen mother. Look at faces. He looks at the horoscopes. And he can even say who will become a widow and who won't. - Yes. Have you heard the name of the head of astrologers Somnath? He was my teacher. He was a great astrologer. He had searched for many horoscopes for a princess and searched for the best marriage proposal. Taking out the auspicious occasion he had married her off with all customs and traditions. But within three years of marriage in a car accident, and her husband died. And the princess was widowed. I'm that princess. And from that day, I don't believe in astrology. If there is a mistake once it doesn't mean that astrology is wrong. How can you say that the mistake that is committed once, won't be committed once again? The mistake committed by the teacher won't be committed by the disciple. Do you not believe in fate at all? I do believe in it. But when the astrologer cannot change fate? Then what's the use of astrology? Pooja! I want to tell you something. God has given you four days of life. Live it with happiness. A person will die. Don't Think about that and waste those four days. I want to make you my daughter-in-law. Tell me, Pooja. Will you refuse me? Queen mother. I cannot refuse you. But I don't want any one's life to be shortened by my coming in this house. Pooja. If death is truth. Life is a truth too. And if you support us I'll teach death to smile too. Priest, you can go now. Tell me, Pooja. Will you be my daughter-in-law? I don't have the strength to refuse your faith. So what are we waiting for? Come on. We'll make arrangements. Grandpa, where are you? Yes, there you are. Grandpa! Today, even I'll drink with you. I've brought very good news. - What is it? I'll tell that to you later, let me drink first. - No. First you tell me. What happened? Grandpa, my beloved. My love, the one who promised to be with me throughout life my everything. Pooja is marrying someone else today. No. - She is marrying someone else. Let's celebrate! Pooja! Yes? Today is the first night of our marriage. I want to ask you something. Tell me. Will you refuse me? - Please tell me. Promise me. Even the shadow of sadness shouldn't fall on my mother's face. I want to see her laughing all the time. I don't even remember my father. For me, my mother was both my parents. If I ever loved anyone in this world. It was just my mother. She is very ill. My mother has a very weak heart. She cannot tolerate even a mild shock. I've done this marriage for my mother's happiness. And our work is to keep her happy in every state. This is my sincere request of you. I'm ready to do anything for her happiness. Thank you very much. Thank you. Me too. Even I've to tell something to you. Yes. Tell me. What do you want to tell me? I loved someone else before marriage. Does mother know about this? - No. And don't even tell her. If you tell her she will undergo a major shock. She should know that we love each other. The two of us are very happy. And as far as your love for someone is concerned. I'll tell you something. I won't exercise my right of being your husband, ever. The temple of the mind which has someone else's idol installed I won't even try to come there. Listen. Please look at me once. My love was my yesterday. You are my today. You are my husband. And now, in the temple of my mind only the idol of my husband exists. And there cannot be anyone else. Prem! Prem! Prem! - Who! Ramesh, my friend. Come on. - Let me drink. Let me drink a bit more. Pooja, you?! Pooja! Grandpa, what is all this going on? If he continues to drink like this. - I can see, son. I thought that whatever I did was for his good. To save him from death's door. But now I think that I pushed him inside the door of death. He doesn't wish to live. I don't understand what to do. How can I save him? Grandpa, can I tell you something? Only Pooja can save him. Pooja! Are you ready? How do I look? Very beautiful. But... What is there on your lips? - What is it? You rogue! You ruined my make up again! What is in your eyes? No. - Don't come near. Okay. - Get out. Rogue! Hello? - Pooja. I'm Ramesh here. Ramesh? Yes, Ramesh. Tell me what is the matter? Prem is drunk throughout the day and night. Every bottle is taking towards death. He cannot forget you. What can I do in this? Only you can save him from death. He doesn't listen to anyone. But he won't be able to refuse you. Because he loves you a lot. Ramesh, I'm not concerned with him any longer. I know that. But it is true that you loved him a lot too. Please come and save him. Or else, he will die. I'm sorry. Ramesh. I can't come. Pooja, I want to apologize to you. Apologize? For what? I heard you and Ramesh speak over the phone. I want you to meet Prem and tell him. He is your yesterday and I'm your today. Every today is indebted to some yesterday. What do you want? I want your yesterday and today to be happy. Only you can save him from death. And I'm sure that he won't say no to you.

They drink their tears. They don't cry. They smile. The intoxication of their love is such they don't need any alcohol. The truth is, you never loved Pooja. You just tried to achieve her. And when you couldn't achieve her you were heartbroken. Because you didn't love her, you loved yourself. No, it isn't so. And you are sad that she married someone else. She is very happy. And you cannot see her happiness. No. This is a lie. If this is a lie, what is truth then? The truth is... ...I've loved you. I love you even today and I'll always love you. If this is the truth, stay happy in her happiness. Smile when you look at her smiling. Instead of dying in her memories, learn to stay alive. And if you really love Pooja, break this bottle. And quit drinking. lf you cannot do this, then don't take Pooja's name from your lips. Don't say that you love Pooja. Don't! Pratap! That two billion party had called from Switzerland. They wish that we should take care of that deal. You go, uncle. I will go. But it is necessary for you to go too. Then make a program for the next month. Not the next month, you'll go tomorrow.

I can understand. But even sister has to face this news. I don't understand how to tell her this. No. No. Don't tell anything to mother. How is this possible? Whatever be the case. Mother shouldn't know anything. This was his last wish. But daughter, Till when will we hide such a huge thing? Till mother's last breath. Okay. As you wish. That shall be done. Nobody except the two of us will know that Pratap is no longer with us. I'll arrange son that Pratap's name isn't there on the death certificate and the other police records. Greetings, mother. - You've come back? You had gone for two months. You came back in ten days? Where is Pratap? Pratap. He has gone to London on some work. And he sent me from Switzerland with uncle. What happened? What happened? Accident. - Accident? I mean, I slipped. Were you wounded? No. It was a small wound. He is mad. Did I send him for a honeymoon or a business? He could have taken you with him. Where is he staying in London? Call him up. I'll speak to him. He must have left now. He said that he has to go somewhere. Maybe it will take a lot of time. Pooja! Pooja! - Yes. What is the matter? You are so lost, you look so withered. No. Why? Did Pratap trouble you? - No. It is nothing like that. Okay. You go and rest. Okay. Go. "There are tears in my eyes." "But I can't cry." "How'll I douse this fire?" "How'll I douse this fire?" "Because there's no sign of rain." "I burn in silence." "I laugh away my tears." "I burn in silence."

I wasn't all right before. But after you scolded me, I'm all right. Pooja, you saved me. Or else the liquor has ruined me. Forget about me. Tell me about yourself. How is your husband? He is all right. He is happy. Who won't be happy with a wife like you? He is really a very lucky man. Oh yes! I was missing you a lot last Monday. I thought I'd congratulate you over the phone. - For what? It was seventh October last Monday. It was your first marriage anniversary. So what if it is belated. I'll congratulate you today. Wish you a very happy first anniversary. And many more to come. Thank you. Shall I go now? I've to go soon. Bye. - Bye. Pooja! Pooja! - Yes? I see that since the time you've returned you always seem so lost. Your appetite has gone down too. What is the matter? No, it is nothing like that. Is it so? He didn't call up? Yes. He called up yesterday night. You were resting. Therefore I didn't tell you. I've told you so many times. Wake me up whenever he calls up. Anyway. It doesn't matter. What was he saying? He was asking about you. He is all right, isn't he? - Yes. Why? I'm having strange dreams since many days. When will he return? He's saying that he will take some time. He wants to complete all his work there. So that he doesn't have to go back again. I don't think that he is saying the truth. Why? Because it is the Durga prayer next week. And he is here on every prayer of the Goddess Durga. Hail the Goddess Durga! Hail the Goddess Durga! Hail the Goddess Durga! Have you come? - How are you mother. I'm fine. I knew that you'd come. Go. Take mother's blessings. Hail the goddess Durga! You weren't there, Pooja was so troubled. She didn't even eat properly and nor did she laugh. See. How she blossoms now! I've come now, mother. Everything will be all right now. Hail the Durga Goddess. Who are you? Me? I'm your husband Pratap. My husband? No. You are not my husband. What has happened to you? I'm your husband. I was saved in that accident. No. This isn't possible. I saw your car burning and turning into smithereens with my own eyes. You saw right. But whom he wishes to save nobody can kill him. But how were you saved? After our car accident when you went to ask for help I had come out of the car anyhow. At that time. There was a blast. And I lost conscious. And when I gained conscious I found myself in an hospital. I found out that some people lifted and took me away. And I was unconscious for many days. Pooja. The power of your love has got me out of the death's jaws. I'm your Pratap. You are so good. Mother. You saved my husband. He is back. You are not Pratap. Tell me. Who are you? What has happened to you? I'm your Pratap. No. Pratap didn't have any wart or anything on his back. Who are you? Tell me. Who are you? What difference does it make whether you are Pratap or Ranjit? You cannot tell mother that Pratap is dead. And that I'm Ranjeet. Because as soon as she hears it that old woman will die. What do you want? I want to use my face. I look like Pratap. Why shouldn't it be? I'm Pratap's father's illegitimate son. Illegitimate son? I should get 5 million in this wealth worth millions. Okay. You will get it. But remember! Whatever I'm doing, it is for mother. If she is pained, I won't leave you alone. Mother should know that we are very happy. And secondly, I'll sleep here. And you'll sleep there. In that room. I'll sleep wherever you tell me to. I'll do whatever you tell me to. I'm concerned with my 5 million. While acting as your husband, it won't take much time to make you my wife. Hey Ranjeet, how was your first night? Is everything fixed now? Boss! There was a bit of a problem. Pooja has recognized me. - What? You fool! Donkey! I'd shown you so many video films and all and had told you to learn everything about Pratap, every nuance. And you were defeated in the first move? Boss. You think about it. If such a sexy girl sticks to you with open arms, then should I sing holy hymns? But you are caught. Isn't it? You've ruined everything. If Pooja had accepted you to be Pratap the whole wealth would be in our hands. You are worried without any reason. I've arranged everything. She will keep me as Pratap in everyone's presence. And she will give me a full 5 million for that. You fool! - What happened now? You are happy with 5 million? Here, I'm facing a loss of 200 billon. 200 billon. I had you remove the car brakes so that the two should die there and you come here as Pratap. So that all the money should be in our clutches. But... anyway. Whatever had to happen has happened. Now don't commit another mistake. Pooja Go. Go! Hide yourself. Greetings, uncle. - Greetings child. Pooja why are you here? Uncle I'm in trouble. - What is it? Yesterday, during the Durga prayers a man appeared from nowhere. He looks similar to Pratap. In fact even the Queen mother accepts him as her son. What are you saying? Did you find out who he was? He said that his name is Ranjit. - Ranjit? Uncle what should I do now? - Be careful. When sister has accepted him to be her son even you'll have to accept him as your husband. But uncle with a stranger I'm scared. Please don't worry. I'm there. I'll arrange everything. Okay, uncle. I'll leave now. - Bless you, child. The chairs this side. And that side place them. - Okay, queen mother. And for dining one that side and And another - Ok, queen mother. It is Pratap's birthday today. We'll celebrate it with great pomp and splendor. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to Pratap." "Happy birthday to Pratap." Now Pooja will sing a song. What is this, mother? Is he child that I should sing happy birthday? Where did I tell you to sing happy birthday? Sing the song that you like the most. "Every grin isn't a smile." "Whether hatred or love, it isn't easy." "The tears of joy and sorrow are alike." "The tears of joy and sorrow are alike." "These tears lack identity." "Every grin isn't a smile." "Whether hatred or love, it isn't easy." "Every word is the same but the meaning has changed." "The heart had gone astray but is steady now." "Such days too come, yet people live through it." "Such days too come, yet people live through it." "There's everything but there is no life." "Every grin isn't a smile." "Whether hatred or love, it isn't easy." "There are many similar faces in this world." "The same veil, and the same face." "The eyes can identify everything." "The eyes can identify everything." "The face of one's own is never unknown." "Every grin isn't a smile." "Whether hatred or love, it isn't easy." "This heart is so weird, when it's lonely," "it has the company of memories." "The world is lost, there is no hope." "The world is lost, there is no hope." "The court of the heart is never barren." "The tears of joy and sorrow are alike." "The tears of joy and sorrow are alike." "These tears lack identity." "Every grin isn't a smile." "Whether hatred or love, it isn't easy." You? How did you come inside? When the husband can be a duplicate can't there be a duplicate key? What do you want? The cake that I gave you, you threw it out of your mouth. But you cannot throw me out of this room. - What do you mean? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Dare you take on step ahead. Slowly. Speak slowly. Or else, your mother-in-law will wake up. Bastard. If you touch me, I'll shoot you. You cannot shoot me. Because, listening to the sound of the bullet the old woman will come here and she will ask you as to what you've done. What answer will you give? And listening to the truth, the old woman will die. What will happen of mother will be thought about later. But you will die. Get out. I said. Get out. Hello? - Hello, Prem Pooja? Prem I want to meet you. What is the matter, Is everything all right? When can you meet me? - Whenever you wish to, come today. Okay. I will come. Greetings, mother. Happy birthday, mother. Where is Pratap? - He is sleeping. Pratap has changed after returning from London. Why? Why are you saying like this? I can see. He sleeps late. He drinks. He was never like this. After marriage, people do change a bit. And then he must have drunk a bit with his friends. Morning. Queen mother. - Morning. Hello, Pooja. - Good morning. I've brought very good news for you. I've seen your blood and ECG report. Your health is better than earlier. And all this is the magic of our medicine. This isn't the magic of your medicine, doctor. - What? All this is the magic of Pooja's service - You are right. If Pooja's services and our medicines work together one day, you'll be completely fit and fine. That means you'll not die. I mean we don't have anything to worry about now. No. It isn't like that. There shouldn't be any negligence. Yes. Okay, mother. I will leave now, Doctor, are you going to the city? - Yes. I'll go with you too. I've some work too. Come on, welcome. I'll leave now. - Okay. 'The old woman doesn't die at all. ' 'I fell as if I should strangle and kill her. ' Pratap Pratap Pratap Yes, mother? - What is the date today? The first of November. Why? Is it something special? No. It is nothing special. I just asked you. Mother. I was going out for some time. I've some important work. - Okay, go. Happy birthday to you. See. Son. I'll not wear it. I won't wear it at all. Happy birthday to you. - No, Pratap! This is my wish. - Such a huge garland. No! - You'll have to wear it once. Wear it once, mother. Just a minute, Mother, you seem so beautiful. I didn't know that it was my birthday today. But you cannot forget my birthday. Can I forget the birthday of the woman who gave birth to me? Is a birthday celebrated in this way? Mad man! You seem so beautiful, mother. My mother! "There are many similar faces in this world." "Many similar veils, masks and garbs." He is not my Pratap. He cannot be my Pratap. But if he isn't my Pratap, who is he? And where is my Pratap? That old woman doesn't die at all. And the doctor says that her health is getting better. I cannot do this drama now. Don't talk nonsense. One doesn't earn property worth millions just like that. One has to work hard for it, he has to use his brains. I've a plan with which... ...we can kill the snake without breaking the baton. What? Illegitimate child? Anything else? I don't know anything beyond this. Pooja. You should have told me all this earlier. Whoever he is, I'll find out about him. And you take care of yourself and the queen mother. Don't leave her alone for even a minute. Was the work done? - Yes, the work is done. Mother. Were you going for a stroll? - Yes. Come on. I'll take you for a stroll. Pooja call me whenever you need me. And take care. - Thank you very much, Prem. I'll go now? - Yes. - Bye! Radha - Yes? What is mother doing? - Sir took her for a stroll. Which side? - That side. Pratap - Yes, mother? Do you remember? You promised me something before going to Europe? Which promise? That you'll make a Shiva temple on this mountain. I do remember it, mother. I've even talked to a architect. He will make a couple of designs for me, You select one of them. Mother, can I forget the promise I gave you? This is a lie. This isn't a lie. This is the truth. I've talked to the architect in uncle's presence. See, uncle is coming here. You speak with him. I never spoke to my son about making any temple. You are not Pratap. Tell me who you are. When you've recognized me. I'll tell you. My name is Ranjeet. Your husband's illegitimate child. What nonsense are you speaking? He isn't speaking any nonsense. He is saying the truth. Brother-in-law used to go to Munnibai's courtesan hall before marriage a lot of times. He is the illegitimate child, this Ranjeet! Mother died and I came on the streets. I used to steal and such to fill my stomach. I went to steal in Mohan uncle's house and was caught. Stop! - Sir, please don't shoot. I thought that I would be beat and go to prison too. But there The scene was different there. He saw my face and said. - What is your name? Ranjeet, sir. Ranjeet? - Yes. Mohanlal He is a cheque of 2 million for you. A cheque for 2 millions! Did you say something, sir? Will you work for me? You'll get 200000 for that. I can do anything for 200000. - Good. My pratap... Where is my Pratap? Where is he? Where is my Pratap? Pratap is not in this world now. Who killed my Pratap? Who killed him? We thought that we would kill both of them. But Pooja survived. And Pratap was killed. And so that your heart shouldn't fail hearing about Pratap's death, Pooja came back as a happily married spouse. And then the boss turned this second grade material making him the real thing and fit him here. Boss, you said that her heart is very weak. She will die as soon as she hears about her son's death. But she is stone hearted. She is listening to our stories. Please make her understand. The son is dead, Now tell her to die too. - Don't worry. Sister, please don't do this injustice to us. Please die yourself. Please die! Mohan. I didn't know that you were such a wretch. Sister this wretch is a greater wretch than me. I'm begging you to die. But he He has planned to throw you down. Ranjeet, am I not correct? - Yes boss. I'll start my work now. Wretches! You devil! Hello police station Hello Inspector My name is Pratap. I had called you. My wife has killed my mother and uncle. And she tried to kill me too. I've locked her inside. Please come, inspector. Inspector this devil killed mother. Madam who has killed whom only the court will decide that. Banerjee, arrest her. Banerjee. - Yes sir? Search that side. I'll see here. - Yes, sir. Come on! My name is Ranjeet. I'm your husband's illegitimate son. Mother was killed and I came on the streets. I filled my stomach with thefts and robberies. The old woman was very smart. Even while dying, she arranged for my hanging. But now Pooja will be hanged. And Ranjeet will be the owner of this whole property. Your honor. I think that Ms. Pooja Devi watches a lot of films. She says that her husband Pratap was killed in a car accident in the foreign country. And nobody knows anything about it in India. After that, a similar looking person came. And nobody found out that he isn't the true Pratap. He is the fake one. Your honor even a blind mother sniffs her son out and knows that he has arrived. But Ms Pooja Devi says that the queen mother who saw with two eyes couldn't recognize him too. And the best part is Milord that fake Pratap slept with her in her bedroom for so many days. And she couldn't find out anything about it. And when did she find out and in which state only she is the one who knows it. Order The truth is Your honor That Ms Pooja is a very smart and loose woman. And she is faking being a principled woman. One day when the queen mother caught her with her lover, she killed the queen mother. When the manager and her husband came there to save her husband she killed the manager too and attempted murder. Your honor. To prove all this I want to present some witnesses to you. You are permitted. - Thank you, sir. Your honor. My first witness is the queen mother's driver, Ram Singh.

I had taken him there. - What happened after that? What after that? The lawyer gave me a hundred rupee note and he told me to go away. And then I returned He is uttering nonsense Let him say anything that he wishes to. Before the truth is decided you'll be given a chance to speak. Continue. Mr. Gupta. - Thank you. Your honor. Ram Singh. When you were returning what happened after that? Sir after that, everything went haywire. What happened? I saw the queen mother coming towards the mountain. You are smiling a lot. What is the matter? Oh God! - What happened? Mother is here. - Mother? Leave! Lowly woman! Aren't you ashamed? You are having fun with another man? You've ruined my family's respect. God knows which was the inauspicious moment when I brought you as my daughter-in-law. Let Pratap come, I'll tell everything. And you see what he does to you. You won't be alive till he comes back. I was scared listening to all this. And I ran and told the manager everything. That's all your, milord. If my friend wishes to ask anything, he can. Thank you, Mr. Gupta Yes Ram Singh, tell me. Are you married? - No. Do you drink? - No. Not at all. Do you gamble or anything? - No. You must be going to hears songs in courtesan halls. - No! No. Sir. I've never gone. - What?

I never got any thirty thousand rupees. Did you get anything less? Yes. - I object your honor. The lawyer is putting his words in my witness's mouth. Your honor. Who is trying to put what in whose mouth either the witness knows it, or the payer knows it. I was just trying to find out where the question is of millions of property did this poor man get less money? Mr. Prem. You cannot ask such questions. I'm sorry, your honor. Anyway. Ram Singh Whatever happened, forget it. Henceforth, take proper money for such things. - Okay. Order. Ok, sir. - Ok, Ram Singh. You can go now. Thank you sir. - Greetings. If my friend the lawyer doesn't have any problems in assisting... ...the law then can I ask him any questions? Mr. Prem. You cannot be forced. lf you don't have any problems No, your honor. I don't mind. Whatever I say, will be truth. I won't say anything except that. Thank you, Mr. Prem. Is it true that you and Pooja Devi know each other before marriage? Yes. We do know each other. - The two of you were fast friends? Yes. You must be meeting too. Let it be. You met after marriage too. We met all of a sudden a couple of times. I didn't ask you how many times Did you meet? - Yes, we met. Did you meet on the day of the incident too? Yes. We met on the day of the incident too. I had gone to drop Pooja home. No. I didn't ask you what you went to do there. Anyway. My last question. Before her marriage, did you and Pooja love each other? Yes, I loved her. I love her today too. And I'll always love her. But it isn't necessary to meet to love. Any more questions? - No. Thanks. Milord my next witness is sub inspector Mr. Mukherjee. Mr. Mukherjee. Who told you about the murder being committed? Mr. Pratap told me. - What did he say? He said that two murders have been committed here. Please come quickly. After that you reached there and caught the murderer red handed? Not red handed. But when I reached Anand Mansion Mr. Mohan was already killed. And the revolver which was used to kill him that was in Pooja Devi's presence. And I arrested Pooja Devi. That's all, your honor. Your witness. Inspector Mukherjee when you reached Anand Mansion, did you see from where queen mother was pushed down? - Yes. And did you get the queen mother's dead body? - No. It's possible that the body drowned in the sea. But I got a wheelchair and the video camera. What did you say? You got a video camera. - Yes. Did you see whose photos were taken last? It didn't have any cassette. - What? There wasn't any cassette in that? Is it not possible, Mr. Mukherjee that someone took out the cassette from it? It is possible. Okay. Tell me, inspector Did anyone else go with you and the other police officers there? Yes. Mr. Pratap Burman had come with us. Is it not possible that Mr. Pratap Burman... ...himself removed that cassette? It is possible. - Thank you, inspector. Your honor. My next witness is Mr. Pratap Burman. Whatever I say. Will be the truth. And nothing else except it. Your name? - Pratap Burman. Are you Pooja Devi's husband? No. He is not my husband. Sir he is not my husband and neither is his name Pratap Burman. He is Ranjeet. She is correct. I don't want to be her husband too. I want to forget that I married this murderer. The mother who made her a daughter in-law of such a big house, she killed her. She killed my mother. Relax, Mr. Pratap. Brace yourself! The court will give you justice. Please brace yourself. Okay, tell me. When the queen mother was killed where were you? I was in Anand Mansion. I was speaking about business with my manager. How did you find out that Pooja Devi was killing your mother? The driver Ram Singh rushed to me. He told me that Pooja and mother are fighting. No, Pooja. No, Pooja. No, Pooja. No What have you done?! You wretch. You killed the queen mother? I won't spare you. You go too. To your sister. And after that I locked Pooja in a room of Anand Mansion and called the police Mr. Pratap, when were you married? I was married last year, on seventh October. When did you go to the honeymoon after marriage? I went on a honey moon eleven months after marriage. Why did you go so late? People go on honeymoons after marriage immediately. Whenever I spoke to Pooja about a honeymoon. She skirted the issue. She skirted the issue? Was there any reason for that? I didn't understand it at that time. But I've understood it now. What have you understood? The lover was there. What would she do in a foreign country. Pooja Devi says that the car that you were driving had failed brakes. The car met with an accident and fell in a ravine. Sir if the car met with an accident... ...then the both of us would have died. That means that the accident didn't take place? Yes. A accident did take place. But it wasn't of our car. It was some other car. The two of us saw a car fall in the ravine. And the next day. There was a photograph in the newspapers about it too. It also said that a Indian was driving the car. Whose name was Ranjeet. Now she wants to make me Ranjeet and wants to prove... ...that I'm not Pratap! That's all your honor. Your witness. Even before today, million of people have come in this court and have sworn over the Gita to say the truth. You are one of them too. But my experience is The people who swear on the truth lie occasionally. What about you? - They must be saying. But I say just the truth. So give me a answer of this simple question. What is your real name? - What do you mean by the real name? Do I've two names? Am I a fake? Why are you getting angry? When did I say that you are fake? What do you mean by real name? By that I mean people have two names. One is the one used at home. Like Vicky, Sandy, Bunty etc. But they have a real name. Don't they? They must be having it. - But what is your real name? I just have one name, . Pratap Burman. Son of Vijay Burman. Son of Shamsher Burman. Anything else? Just a minute. What did you say? Pratap Burman, son of Vijay Burman? Do you mind? No That means that Vijay Burman was your father? - Yes. Did he have moustaches? - What? I asked you. Did he have moustaches? Yes. He had moustaches. Then why were you thinking about it for so long? I saw it in my childhood. I was remembering it. Remember it. Or else you'll forget your name too. Okay tell me. Where did you study in childhood? Then you'll ask me which college I attended In which division did I pass BA. How many marks did l get in which subject Sir I've come here to ask justice for my mother's murder. I haven't come here to ask any job. And the lawyer is hell bent on proving that I killed my mother to save his beloved. Why will I kill my mother? Because she wasn't your mother. You are not Pratap Burman. If I'm not Pratap Burman, who is Pratap Burman? Where is he? Pratap Burman is where you've sent him. I didn't send him anywhere. - Think about it properly. Did you not send him anywhere? I didn't send him anywhere. - Did you send him to the other world? No. - Did you not kill Pratap Burman? No. - Who didn't kill Pratap Burman? I didn't - Yes. What do you mean? You said that you didn't kill Pratap Burman. That means that you are someone else and Pratap Burman was someone else. Now you tell us who you are. Sir The lawyer is confusing me. I'm Pratap Burman. - No. You are not Pratap Burman. You are Pratap killer, Ranjeet! That's a lie! - This is truth. His car brakes failed on sixth October. And you tried to kill both Pratap and Pooja. This is a lie! And you are taking advantage of being his clone. No. - When the queen mother came to know about it, you killed her too. No. - Yes. And you want to be saved by accusing Pooja of everything? This is nonsense. This is lies. I'm respected person of this city. My name is Pratap Burman. And this is my passport. Which has the dates of my leaving and coming back to India correctly. There is even the immigration stamp on it. If I were dead, how would I come back? I've proof that I'm alive. But does the lawyer have any proof that... ...proves that Pratap Burman is dead? If he does then present it to the court and then accuse me of being a impersonator or killer. Mr. Prem Kapoor. The court wishes to know whether you've proof of Pratap's death or not. No. - A person meets with a car accident. There is some investigation. There is a post mortem report. There is a death certificate. Do you've anyone of these things? No, your honor. Mr. Prem Kapoor The next time you come to court prepare your case and come accordingly. Don't waste my time. Sir I've just one request. Please decide about this case quickly. It is my mother who has died. Not the lawyers. He will do something or the other. The case will be decided on the next twentieth. The court is adjourned. Lawyer You must be thinking that after Pratap had died how did his passport has his returning stamp. It is very simple. When Pratap died Mohanlal put my passport in his passport's place. And I came to India on his passport. That means Ranjeet is dead. Pratap is alive. And yes. Remember something. You cannot win from me. Because you are the slave of truth. And I'm the king of lies. What are you thinking. Mr. Prem? - It is so sad. Sometimes even when we know the truth we cannot do anything. Because we don't have any proof of that truth. The truth looks on helplessly and the lies the lies sits on the throne of truth. And today It is happening everywhere. Lies are good and truth has a blackened face. Mrs. Pooja Burman. The lawyer isn't to be seen. Do you want to say anything or give any proof? You are permitted to do so, Sir I've accepted that I killed Mohanlal. When I've accepted this crime and have accepted the noose then what is the need of refuting the accusation of mother's death? What is the need to lie? The people who take the help of lies are those who commit crime and wish to save themselves from the law. Who give servants money and make them give false testimonies to place their crimes on others. Like Ranjeet has done. I didn't give any servant any money. I didn't make anyone give any wrong witness. Then why are you so angry? When did I say that you made anyone give wrong witness? I said that Ranjeet has made others give wrong witness. Are you Ranjeet? Sir There is no proof that my husband is dead. But does everything that doesn't have a proof is a lie? If I cannot prove that there is a God will your court decide that there is no God? Excuse me, your honor. I apologize for coming late. Mother Your honor. When I found out that mother is alive I found it necessary to bring her to court. The police didn't get her body because she fell into the river. Some villagers saw her and they saved her. Unfortunately she has lost her strength to speak. But she can hear with her ears and she can answer all our questions nicely. And therefore, your honor to throw light on this case, I want to ask her a few questions. - Permitted. Queen mother, the one who pushed you into the ravine, is he present in court? Carefully, queen mother. Can you signal us as to who that person is? That? The one who sits in the white suit? But mother, he is your son Pratap. Mr. Gupta. Yes? - I want to speak to you in privacy. Okay. Your honor. I wish to speak to Mr. Pratap alone. - Permitted. Thank you, sir. - Your honor. The queen mother has just said that this person is a murderer. I'm afraid that he may try to run away. I request you to send him with the Inspector Mukherjee. Request granted. Inspector Mukherjee, go with them. Please come. You sit here and speak. I'll wait outside. Thank you, very much., Sit down. What is the matter? Your honor. I want to ask this woman - No. No, sir. You'll not ask any questions now. Judge! My mother is alive. I don't want anything now. I thank god a thousand times that my mother is alive. Mother! Mother, you have come Tell me who are you? Tell me! who are you? See this. It isn't me who is turning the false... ...into true and the lies into the truth. It is the lawyer who is making it. What is this, Mr. Prem. This is a court. Not a drama company. Your honor. Truth has been hidden a million times using lies. Today. Even I've used lies. Not to hide the truth, but to bring it in the forefront. And Here is the truth. Your honor. I was sure that looking at the queen mother alive, Ranjeet will want to speak to his lawyer in private. And for that inspector Mukherjee took him to such a room where a video camera was hidden previously. What they talked there, see for yourself. What is the matter? - This is not queen mother. What nonsense are you blabbering? She is not queen mother? - Because I had strangled and killed her. And after that, I threw her in the ravine, Then Pooja - Pooja didn't do anything. Because Pooja came to know that I'm not her husband. She saw us throwing the queen mother. And she started firing. I took Mohanlal in the front and he died. Nobody will move from their place. Otherwise, I'll shoot her. Come with me. - No. I will kill you. You won't be able to do anything to me. As soon as I die, these people will lynch you. Don't you dare. Pooja you Your game is up. Ranjeet. Come on. The mars is auspicious. Grandpa see who has come. - Oh Pooja. Come. Come. Shastri jee. You are here too? Now tell me. What does your astrology tell you? All is auspicious now. And you'll be married within a week. No. I won't listen to you now. Why, grandpa? - Because I cannot wait for another week. You'll be married today itself. You are great, grandpa. Bless you.
