What is going on? - What happened? Mladen and Iva are dead! What?! Think he'll attack us now? - Never! Didn't you hear me? He aimed at us. But his rifle jammed! - Are you sure you saw it? Yes! Happy now? In this situation it's important to remain a compact team. It's important we remain a compact team. It's the only way to overcome the threat looming on us. - It's the only possible way... Have you noticed that you're in a mixed forest? Yes, Muhlo. A mixed forest is a forest without one prevailing plant species. Yes, Judita. Look behind me, you'll notice hornbeam, wide-leaved willow and beech. - Say what? Due to the density of growth, light barely reaches the ground, and low plants are scarce. Jesus, you startled me. Don't shoot, I'm already dead. I would have had I wanted to. You got "green". Who shot you? An accident within our own ranks. - Yeah, right! The way they treat you, it may have even been on purpose. I fell into a trap. A hole in the ground. The rifles you got look more real than our space ones. What are your plans? I plan to find a road, hitch a ride to the hotel, and wait for them there. They have to reach the hotel. Shall we go together? OK. Seems like another one fell into a trap. Perhaps he managed to flee. - Oh, fuck my mother! Fuck my own mother! - Stop! That was Black Devil! He's come to get us! Stop this instant! - Black Devil, you fool! I told you, no more bullshit! Cut that Bosnian crap, or I'll pluck out your tongue! Tell me it's all part of this adventuristic weekend! I hope this is all a part of the game. No fucking signal of no fucking network! Give me the gun! - Beat it! I'll buy you a toy gun when we get back! Stop you two! Are you mad?! Now we'll kill each other?! Where did you get that gun? - I bought it! Why? - For the fun of it. And self-defense! - Can you use it? No, you can! Of course, I'm practicing 3 times a week. Listen here... The big boss has a plan! We'll split into small groups and meet at the last point. Are you fucking with me? Excuse me? That's an idiot plan! That way they can kill us one by one. It's obvious you're no shrewd military strategist. That way... You stupid fucking boor. In a real war you have no time to shit what you ate for dinner. From now I'm in charge. We'll pull ourselves together, in a single group try to find the last point and wait for the coaches. - That's his plan? No, that's my plan. His plan sucks. Give me the map. The compass, too! Was that some pal of your armed guy? Probably. - Terrific! Death by frenzied Dvornik, or by some local tribe! Unless we kill each other first. Croatian special! Turn that gun away, or I'll tan your hide! Here's the situation. The last point is there, the path leads that way. The path takes too long. I suggest the shortcut. Suggestion accepted! This is the first and the last time that you addressed me like this in front of my employees. I'm scared shitless. We did it, Sis! We did it! We were great! Mom will commend us when she comes back. I'm so... I'm so... Now you're going to be mine! No, Muhlo, no! Here's a chance, my prince, to prove yourself as a man and an electro-technical engineer. Electro-acoustical in fact. Electro-jerking, if you ask me. Go on, electro-engineer of sorts! Bypass the circuit and be a man capable of providing for his gentle half. Can we pause? I'm a bit dizzy. Are you OK? Yeah, sure... Just to catch some air. I'm not used to this kind of pace. The moss... North... I am so sorry for not being there for you when you decided on that moronic add. Thanks. But it wouldn't matter. - I know. But still. Then, as if on purpose... The client was pleased. He dully paid for it. The only thing that matters. Yeah, right. If I'd heard that from Maja or Mladen, I'd have even believed it. Cool, huh? - Fuck! Dr. Seuss would have been proud. A buyer's a buyer, no matter how small. It's good. Better than I thought. I think the animation fits in nicely. The way the kid looks at him... My cousin's kid. Kid is so gifted. Knows the entire Sidran by heart. I wanted them to be intensive, clear, not hectic... the letters, I mean. The uncle guy, is it that Formula 1 TV reporter? What? He's an actor, a professional. TV-series, movies... - I haven't seen him. What does the boss say? - Mr. Jongbloed is impressed and wants to know if anyone from the client's team saw the add? We're showing them at 1PM. It's going to be OK. There were 7 of them during the shooting. They okayed everything. Terrific. - Excuse me... - Here we go. I'm still a bit unfocused. What do that we promote here? A new mobile operator package. It says so... The BLA option. No, I'm just surprised by the pedophile note of the situation. My mind won't accept the information about what product I need to get here. I told you! - What exactly? An add simulating a sexual relationship between a child... What are you talking about? Where do you see sex? What should this represent then? Emotional involvement with the protagonist. A child in danger. - That's right. The product we communicate with saves a child from a hazard. Spielberg does it all the time. What's good for Spielberg isn't good for you? You compare yourself with Spielberg? Why would I want to do that? What does he say? Nothing, it's private. You translate everything? - Yes. So now what? Let's tell the client you came back from your vacations and the campaign based on their guidelines no longer meets our... don't know, moral standards and we give up the campaign? Let me tell you something. Bosnia has its own Oscar. Fuck Spielberg. So I'm the only one who won't accept to sell a product showing a man in a nursery licking his lips? Not the only one. - Don't take it so seriously. Have we done anything similar in the last 10 years?! Branko, times are changing. We evolve, we keep pace with today, where it seems you're no longer the majority owner! This will get us rewards. Mr. Jongbloed realizes unnecessary tensions. He suggests we vote should we show the add to the client or we severe the cooperation. Who opposes we show it? For? Sorry. Intestinal problems... So that's settled. Mr. Jongbloed suggests we switch to the team building topic. Branko? Branko? Are you all right? Never been better. Let's go. Let's reach the hotel before them. Sis? Judita? Where are you? Sister dear? Muhlo! Muhlo! Judita! Muhlo! Where are you at? Where are you at? Irresponsible brats. Two more steps! You can do it, Tarzan! No shock! I'm not earthed! Now were going to change this hunting ground a bit. A fine moment to touch yourself. I've no more gums. Anyone? - Chew the leaves. You know what? Fucking him gives you no right to be a bitch to the rest of us. What was that? You know what you just did? - What you're going to do, huh? Silence... - I'll talk if I want to! Don't shoot, fine people! Shoot her! - Don't, gentlemen and ladies. My intentions are honest. Shoot her already! Translate! I want to go with you to the big city. I no longer see myself a part of this wilderness I was born in and forced to live in. I've overgrown my home. It offers not enough for my quivering dreams. Shoot her! Too long I've suffered, not wanting to hurt my family. And when you arrived, offering us a window into the world, I thought for a moment it will be better. But alas! The girl was obviously sent as a bait. That creature that took away Sinisa can come back any moment. Says the girl was sent as a diversion and we can expect an attack. She sounded honest to me. Seems my resolute reaction got her scared. Or she really wanted to come along. Let's not bust our head over this. What has been done, has been done. We have a long road ahead of us. Come. How much more? You're not even half full. I have an uneasy feeling. - Stop complaining. It's not at all unpleasant. It's all in your head. I mean, this whole thing today. In the toilet I heard a shot, but not from a rifle. Perhaps Kuzma also brought a gun. I don't know. Something's not right. Everything is perfect. Kuzma will do his thing, papers will bring the story, the firms will fight for us. The only paintball here where people really die. Europe will invade us. America! We're on a high horse, my friend! I fear Kuzma might kill them all if he snaps. Who's going to make us a web-site then... Stop! It's in my lungs! Don't you worry about Kuzma. He knows who not to touch. He's not crazy, nor stupid. There. It's important to endure at least 10 minutes. Then I'll pump you out. I can't guarantee that. You're all smooth. Did it last night. Waxing or shaving? Shaving. Waxing hurts. You see, I wax. It's good when it hurts. Pain keeps us alert. Branko, you've no family? I mean, the wife and kids. You never talk about it. Why do you think I'd like to talk about it now? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. No, I don't have a family. It's never too late. Right. It's easy for you men to say that. Your bio-clock isn't ticking away. What about you? I'd see a car waiting for you. Yes, when our shifts coincide. You don't need to explain. - No, you just surprised me. That's Marko. I didn't know you noticed things like that. We've been living together for two years. I'm sure he misses you now. - Well... He'd better. Vesna... When we reach the road, we'll hitch a car to Zagreb, and you leave. Don't go back to the hotel. - My things are there. Forget things. I'll pack them and send them to you. It's not fair towards others. What will they think? An acquaintance is opening a firm and he's looking for specialists. He'd be delighted to have someone like you. Are you firing me? - No. I'm not firing you. - What then? Nothing. Nothing, forget it. I just wanted... Was that some kind of the loyalty test? I suppose so. Get lost! Scram! Scram! The forest is crying. The forest is crying for our damned souls. Think I won't? Seems they've found the kid. We have to hurry. We have to hurry. Hang on. A suggestion. You go on. I stay, take a cover and wait for them. Bang-bang, then I catch up with you. But we lose firearm support. He's afraid for his ass. But seems reasonable. Someone should stay with you. - No. There's only one weapon. Someone should cover you back. - Who's going to cover his? Especially if it's going to be you. Or perhaps Nedim. Frankly, I'd rather stay with the gun then. Are you hitting on me? - You wish. Two women will stay behind. That's going to be silent! Exchange recipes with that nut when she comes. Your mom really traumatized you. We can fuck with each other for days like this. Actually, for 5 minutes, then she'll be here. You go on, I'll fix things here. Good luck. Leave me, you fool! - Come on! I've emptied myself! How about you? Not that good. I keep thinking someone's watching me. That's the point. Little creatures are watching you. Foxes, squirrels, bunnies. And not only watching, they're also smelling you and will evade this area marked by our scent. Come on, will you! - I can't when I'm being watched! Now you're watching me! Does the macho man want some beer to help him out? How about a crate of beer for the benefit of the forest creatures! You know I don't drink beer. - Sure. The girlie drinks no alcohol. Doesn't like it. We're only eating soups and drinking juices. You don't like whatever I do! What is that tone? You want to fight with me? - No. Hear that? You whore! Well? Anything more to say in defense of males, darling? If you've survived this, my hat is off to you. It sounded like a real gun. I heard the same right before we met. It must be little Edi. - Edi? The brat brought a real gun. Last night he had one too many and showed it to me. I should have invited him to my room, thrilled. Edi's got a gun? He's a regular fucking John Wayne. What are we going to do about this door? I'm fascinated. Your rifles look like real ones, you got keys... We got nothing, or I missed something. Ladies first. A gentleman, in this wilderness. Branko? Coming! Sounded like a Glock to me. - Told you it was a gun. Fine, a gun, but a Glock. But where did Kuzma get it? He can only have an old Zastava or a Luger. Something unpredicted is going on. I don't know. For now we're staying here, but if we hear it again, we'll have to do something fast. I can't hold it any longer! Where to now? There. That's where it came from. Let's go home, we've done enough. I'm sorry. Let's wait for her. We can't be sure those were her shots. Thunder again... - Know that Allah is great and we can't escape Him. - What about our deal? You could have waited for me. - What happened? I did the job I was left to do. You rid us of that savage? - She's at the bottom of a gully. Are you sure? - Three bullets in her chest. What is that? You shit your pants? For real? - I sure did. You're really the lowest. Go there and clean yourself. Throw away your underpants. You can stop thanking me. Let's wait till we get rid of Dvornik. He's no problem. The woman was on her own turf. I breathe more freely knowing she won't jump me from a tree top. Kid... the gun! What are you waiting for?! I can hit Nikolina! - She's had it! Shoot! I've been hit! Get some rags, guys! It hurts! Forgive me... Didn't mean to. It's because I'm from Bosnia, right? Please, don't die. - Raise his head. And Dad told me, Nedim, son, don't go to Zagreb. Don't go, stay home. They'll always hate you there, 'cause you're a real man, 'cause you're more clever, 'cause Sarajevo is an Olympic city and Ivo Andric won the Nobel Prize. And Mesa Selimovic was close. Those Viennese clerofascist will never forgive you that. Fuck your strukli. Baklava is a real cake! Why didn't I listen to him? Why didn't I stay in my beautiful Slovenia? Press here! Got any ammunition? I'll take that! Ask the genius is he happy now. Is the number of the employees about right now. Ask him! Maja asks is the number of the employees is about right now? Tell her I don't want to discuss it here. Says he doesn't want to discuss it here. We'll need an interpreter. How do you communicate when you're intimate? Cut the crap! - I smell gunpowder! They've got to be close. I can manage alone! Pick up those mushrooms. Why, that's a... dead baby! Where is this world heading? Has no one left any respect for mothers who suffer for nine damn months?! They allow a woman only a role of a mother and then they take away her child! Yes! And only because she could give birth again, exclude herself from the world and leave the helm to men! Give births to babies and don't ask questions! Don't leave your house, your dungeon! We'll shackle you with children like prisoners are with chains! Like it ever restrained you. Excuse me? - I said, you've been resisting successfully! What are you talking about? - You scraped out of you how many? Six, seven? - Shut up right now! I've fucking had enough of you! Let's check the final point first to see if they're there, then we'll see. Someone lives here. You can't stop progress. Anybody home? You stay here, I'm going to check around. What is going on here? Miss Maja obviously has questions. She can ask anything. - You can ask anything. How much is he allowed to know? She asks how much am I allowed to know. - Don't worry about him. You leave him to me. Don't you worry about me, you leave me to him. What is going on here? First of all, Dvornik obviously knows, since he killed Zuric. Dvornik obviously knows, since he killed Zuric. He can't prove anything. - He can't prove anything. Wait a second... No translations unless you tell me what is all this! I'm not translating unless you explain everything. Hello. Excuse our intrusion, there was no one. I'm Vesna. Branko! Help! I'm still hoping you're just pulling my leg. Should I believe it? Who else is involved? Who else? It makes no difference. - Are you kidding me? Yes! It makes no difference! I'm not involved entirely. I knew about Dvornik. I had no idea about Lovrek and Dakic. The important thing is everything will be OK. All the better, things happened out of the plan. Says, thing turned out better now that more were killed. You're mad! I'm going back. Is it clear? Not a word to anyone about this? Why would it be clear? I presume you want your daughter to live up to her next birthday. Think about it. Well, now you're fucked. We must go. Vesna... We must go. Branko... - Not now! Let's go. Give me a cigarette. I don't smoke. Want a gum? Fuck your gum! A great shot... What? The interpreter before me, who got killed... She didn't like the plan, or got too intimate with the boss? Thank you. I only wanted to know. I was at my mother's when she bought it. Across the city. - It's all fine. I only wanted to know if you've got it in you. What are you talking about? Nothing. I'm explaining how to use a gun. You and I are OK? - Absolutely. I'm happy to hear that. I'd like to tell our colleagues things that will encourage them in these hard moments. OK. Just let me finish this. Here you are. Trust me, you gain nothing by whacking me. You can't expect him to marry you. Dear colleagues and, I dare say, friends. Dear colleagues, I have to confess an important thing. Perhaps this situation seems pretty hard to you. Whatever happened today is my direct fault. During the past weeks I've been with you... I mean... I tried to organize murders I realized that for you there are no problems that can not be solved. Of some of your troublesome colleagues, Branko, Vesna and Iva. Mayonnaise, panel boards and scaffolds, ophthalmological practice campaigns, from which other agencies run away from, are kid's games to you. But things went wrong, as is usually the case, when organized by morons like me. Wait a minute! Maja, let me finish. Maja, let me finish. I really do not exaggerate... What I realized is, if I call you the unsung heroes of today, that I can't live with a burden of lives on my conscience, modern bards, the true guides in the vastness of today's markets, so I'd ask you to be so good who point towards quality. I sincerely admire you. And put me out of my misery. Please, kill me. - What is he saying? I assure our Nedim that we're all do everything within our power to keep him alive until help comes. I'd like to tell you, especially Nedim, that murders were not planned by myself alone. I had help... Do it, he's suffering. - I really can pick them. Ljudevit! Come, power is turned off. Where are we going? Find the others. - Why? We should warn Iva. I wasn't prepared, I didn't expect... And others? Nikolina and Nedim fled. And Mladen? What happened to Mladen? Branko! He drew first. Don't... If it hadn't been for that hole, we wouldn't have... What is all this? The new management doesn't count on us any more. - What? Instead of firing us, they have us killed? Firing means severance pay. I drew nice contracts for all, and I'm a share holder. But this is obviously cheaper. No, it makes no sense. - Oh? When was the last time Iva got an OK from a client? I get OK's all the time. Last month I had three campaigns. Two toothpaste brands and a detergent. And those loans this month! - Vesna... How many morning nauseas to make it obvious there's no intestinal virus? What? A maternity leave is too expensive? It's not only that. Each case of small pox, scarlet fever... Otitis... you're absent for a week. And when you do work, you're not really concentrated. If the fist child is a success, you'd want more. They can't have that. Then what? Seems to me you'll know how to bring them up, school them, make them wise people who can use their brain. Whom we'll then try to sell tariff options? And those new beer bottles. Oh, Jesus Christ! The developed West... So now what? Let's go find them. And? I don't know. I don't know any more. You think they all knew? I doubt it. Nikolina and Nedim saw me. They didn't see all of it. Only when I... Let' go find them. She says they killed Kuzma, Judita and little Marul. She doesn't know where Muhlo is. What about them? Danica, did Kuzma get anyone? - I don't know. My poor Kuzma is dead! That's why I killed two of them with my own hands! She killed two... What shall we do with her? - I've no idea. Danica, listen. We'll let you down. Do it! Promise you won't attack our people! I swear on Saint Vendelin Vosnjak. - Cut it. So you know I'm not kidding. Touch just one of ours, I'll come to you and smash that TV you got! I lost my husband and children, and he'd destroy my plasma! No need to worry as long as you don't touch them. You know how they look? Yellow and grey. If you see a boar, a bear, take it out on them. Go and terrorize the village. Leave our people alone! Great. Where did you see them last time? Run home now! Think she'll leave them alone? - Sure. Fucking plasma and the dish. I'll bet they watched Zona Romantica all day long. I'm such a moron. Go into business with my family! "Lamb"... - Sorry. I don't know what to do. Set the forest on fire? - Whatever with? They will wait for us at the last point. God! We should give him some water. You must not die. I can't go to prison. There's a river close by. We're going to carry him. I don't get these distances. - Please, empty the rifle. You said Edi had a pistol. Point it at him and tell him to throw it away. He won't know it's empty. It may fire by accident. As it did with Mladen, which I can testify. When they left me, I went roaming. I heard shots and saw everything. Nedim and Nikolina were too scared to realize what happened. OK? Come on, give me the bullets. If I told you to stay here and wait, you'd never listen, right? Obviously, right? I'm talking to you! Domagoj! Don't you turn your back on me! - I turn my back so I don't have to look at that never satisfied mug of yours! Everybody is always either stupid or wrong! Not everybody. - Oh, sorry. Your Power Yoga friends are great except the one with that idiot hairdo, that fat cow and that skinny fool! You're twisting my words. - You ever hear yourself? Look at yourself? See how we live! We live quite appropriately. - In the shabby, fucking 20 square feet in a basement! That's enough for me. - No car! We take a bicycle to this neck of wood for mushroom so we can eat something other that fucking sprouts! There! Something is always fucking for him! Always an allusion to his God given "tool"! That is absolutely irrelevant! You're going to hit me now? Go on, do it. Huh? I'm not going to hit you. I've no more need to even touch you! I'm going home, and you keep pissing these woods! There he goes! What a man! Is it my fault you can't find a job?! Yes! It fucking is! They offered me a job at Marshall, at Sony dealership! They called from Logitech! - Yes! Life of a capitalistic slave is all you need! No, I need life of a slave to a neurotic... - Take this off me! Domagoj! Domagoj! What, you male fool?! This turns you on?! Domagoj... Domagoj! It hurts so... Help me get up. No! The bitch bit my shoulder! She also hurt my foot. I'll take you like this then. - No, no! You crouch, I'll climb on your back. I doubt I can walk. There... OK now. Easy! She bust my ribs. - OK. Slow down. Slower! You're tumbling me all over! - Sorry. He's still bleeding. It's best if he dies, so we can go on. Where are the others? - Don't shoot! Where are the others? Were the only ones. - Jongbloed? Dead. - And him? Edi shot him. It was an accident, I didn't mean to. Throw away your gun. - I don't have it. Kid, I don't feel like... Branko! Where to? Hand the gun. To her? Yeah, right! We have to help Branko. You fucking idiots! Don't move! Throw down your weapon! - We have a wounded man! That's for pointing a rifle at a lady! This one needs a doctor, fast! - You two carry him! Move! - There's a man in the river! He's not the first one. And shut up! You'll explain it to the police. Let's go! Move it! I'm taking these two to the first doctor. We'll stay in touch. In case you hear something against that plan. Are you OK? Drive! Drive! And not a word! Slow down, so you don't get any funny ideas. Why are you like that? - Like what? I brought 11 of you, now there's only 5, one with a firearm wound, and another with a rifle pointing to an unarmed woman. I'm not interested! Explain it to the police. We can also explain why the fence was not electrified like it was supposed to be. And why in our attacker's house there were maps identical to those we got? And why was there also a key to the enclosed area. Sure, we'll explain everything. You thought you'd pull out pretending you knew nothing? Oh, really? - Shut up and drive! He'd better stop. If you resolve this the only way you can and he's still driving, we'll end up in a ditch. I don't know... I know you didn't plan to get your hands bloody, but there you have it. There's that forest creature's rifle. Choose. Bloody hands or bloody asshole in a prison. Stop. You'd shoot a pregnant woman? Leave her to me. Since you're so trigger happy, there are two more passers-by. Oh, fuck. Drive on, huh? Zagreb bound? You're so nice, thank you so much! The seat is jammed. I'll move back. Go on in. If you hadn't stopped, we'd have been doomed. We came on a bike, but we got lost, so we forgot where we'd left it. It was tied to a post like that one! If you only knew what happened to us today... I can see you weren't bored, either! We're a really merry bunch. You're really in for a treat. Can we sing a tune then? You've got nothing! You're just hysterical.
