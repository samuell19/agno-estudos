What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family is together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy. And, yes, I was negative. You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it or you before. Come on, time to go. I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are too. And I'm gonna appreciate... Yeah, I'll be there in a minute, okay? Doctor's waiting. Let's go. I'll be there in a minute. That's true love. Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much. And it is just the way I want it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far, before he tried to even up. But I didn't tell him that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut." I think anything's possible. I think if we get... We so often get caught in this state of negativity, and it's a poison like nothing else. Technically, you can take him out against our recommendation, but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court. And he's just getting used to the routine here. I don't want him to get used to the routine here. 8 months is already long enough. Hey, Mom... Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly? What? - I don't understand. - Oh, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. I guess everybody leaving today. Hello, Mrs S. An honour to finally meet you. Pat told me all about how God made you rich in character. And you're the mighty oak that hold the household together. And not to mention the lasagne you make on game day when the Birds play. Danny was in for assault, because of crystal meth and alcohol. - Bad combination. - On top of an anxiety disorder. That's when I was an x-ray technician and I had my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long too. But my hair only grew when I was older. 'Cause when I was younger, my hair didn't grow, because my brother... Remember I told you about my brother had a Jheri curl and I couldn't get a Jheri curl, because my hair didn't grow long enough. - He's obessed with his hair. - And I was jealous of my brother, but wait a minute. - Hello? - Yeah, it looks great now. - You like it? - No, it's good now. Wait, wait, man! You're going the wrong way. - It is this way. - What?! Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away. You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave. All right, Mom, just hold on a sec. Let's just talk about this. - Mom, just listen! - Don't touch the steering wheel! Pat, this whole thing was a mistake. I'm sorry, Mom. You okay? I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now. It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know. He's my friend, so he's rooting for me. I'm having a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault. Mom, could we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus. Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself. DeSean Jackson. What happened to DeSean Jackson? - Come on, tell me that one. - Insanity. He spikes the ball at the 1-yard line, the 1-fucking-yard line. I mean... Get into the end zone, dummy. I mean, he celebrates before he's even in. You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time. They get close and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? What makes the Cowboys America's team? - Because we are. We're America's team. - Give me the answer, what? You should be one of us. We're in Philadelphia. What's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor! What's more American than a cowboy? - You know what's more American? - What? Benjamin Franklin. That's what's more American. - Benjamin Franklin? - Benjamin Franklin. - The founder of our country in Philadelphia. - You mean the guy... ...with the little glasses and long, scraggly hair? What about the lightning with the kite? He stood in the storm with a kite. If he wasn't on a 100-dollar bill, nobody would even know who he is. - Why do you got so many of these things? - No, don't touch this. I didn't even touch them. Why, don't blame me. Who did this? Who took the remotes like this? - Did you do this, Randy? - No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. - Hey! Ah, there she is! - It's none of your business. Look how beautiful. - What? - Hey. - What's this? - Hi. - Everything good? - Mm-hm. Well... - Where is it? - It's right here. You got it. Well, we got that, we don't want them to steal that. - You still got yours? - Yeah, I got mine. So, you don't talk to me? You didn't tell me you took him out? - Well, he's ready. Look at him. - You didn't tell Dad you're picking me up? Don't worry about that. I wanna make sure when you come out that you're okay and I... - She didn't say anything. You didn't tell me. - The court said yes. Don't worry. Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because the court listens to the doctor. - The court listens to the doctor. - Yeah, the court said... - If the doctor... - Dad, Dad, Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go. - Don't worry. - Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed, he said we should do is we should plead that, then I would serve 8 months and then I can get out. It's all under control. - Well, okay, okay, congratulations. - Thank you. - So, what are you doing with yourself? - You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant. - It's gonna be a cheesesteak place. - How're you gonna pay for it? - I'm gonna pay for it. Don't worry about it. - From your bookmaking? - Who told you that? - Mom told me. - Outside. - No, I didn't. You just told me outside, Mom. What are you talking about? Five minutes ago, when we were walking up the stairs, you said... "Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking." Why, why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him? He has the wrong idea. Everything is fine, Patrick. I'm more concerned about you than anything else. - Good, Dad, good. - Okay, the question. The big question is what are you gonna do with yourself? What am I doing? I'm getting in shape. I'm getting trimmed, getting really fit for Nikki. I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back. Nikki sold the house. She left. - Didn't your mother tell you she...? - Let me tell you something. You don't know about my marriage. Okay, Dad? All right? Our marriage... We're very, very much in love, okay? Just like you two. Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's not around anymore. Nikki left. What are you doing, Dad? Excelsior. Excelsior. - What does that mean? - Excelsior. It means you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take all this negativity and I'm gonna use it as fuel. I'm gonna find a silver lining. That's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth. What the fuck?! Stupid fucking book! I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids. I mean, the whole time... Let me just break it down for you. The whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley. It's 4 o'clock in the morning, Pat. And he does. He does. He survives the war after getting blown up. He survives it and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant! And they escape up in the mountains. And they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance. They both like to dance with each other. There's scenes of them dancing. Which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad. I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive?" "Let's have a good ending to the story?" Pat, you owe us an apology. Mom, I can't apologise. I'm not gonna apologise for this. You know what I will do? I will apologise on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here. Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologise to us too. - Why didn't you run with me, huh? - I was reading. Oh, please! Do us a favour. Don't read for a while. - What are you wearing a garbage bag for? - Gonna go run now. Wait. Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window. - I'll fix it when I get back. - Fix it now. Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy. I don't wanna go to therapy. You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go. [My Cherie Amour by Stevie Wonder] Is that song really playing? We have music sometimes. That song is killing me. - Could you please turn it off? - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - I don't have the controls. - I'm sorry I don't have the controls. - Did Dr. Timbers put you up to this? Is there a speaker here? ls the speaker here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay? That was a messed-up thing you did, Dr. Patel, all right? That's a messed-up thing. I'm sorry, but that's... - You can call me Cliff, please. - Yeah, well, Cliff... That's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Don't you write that down in your... I don't know, a little book you write stuff down in? I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you. Bravo! It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds. I should just tell you that right now. - No, you have to medicines. - No. I'm not gonna take any meds. No. Look, it makes me foggy... - No, you will have to take medication. - I don't wanna need meds, doctor. I'm sorry. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium. He beat up so many people in the Eagles game, he's on the exclusion list. - I had one incident. - But one incident can change a lifetime. But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. - She just needs to take responsibility for hers. - What's hers? - What's hers? - Mm-hm. Are you joking? Well, let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I left early, which I never do, by the way, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the high-school principal. I come home and what's playing, but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing. And I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, 'cause I should've. I come home, what do I see? I see... I walk in the door and I see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it. And I walk up the stairs and, all of a sudden, I see the DVD player. And on the DVD player is the CD, and it's playing the wedding song. And then I look down and I see my wife's panties on the ground. And then I look up. I look up and I see her naked in the shower. And I think, "Oh, that's kind of sweet. She's in the shower. What a perfect thing. "I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. "We never fuck in the shower anymore. Maybe today we will." I pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history teacher with tenure. [My Cherie Amour by Stevie Wonder] And you know what he says to me? "You should probably go." That's what he says to me. So, yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But then I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so. All right. Can you talk about something that you did before or after? About a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which... ...wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm... Undiagnosed bipolar. Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened, And that's when everything snaps. So, I then realised that, "Oh, wow, you know, I've been dealing with this my whole life." And without any supervision, I've been doing it all on my own with no help. And, you know, basically, I've been like white-knuckling at this whole time. - That had to be hard. - Yeah, it's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, Which I do now. Sort of. Pat, you have to take your medication. - I can't, Mom. I can't make it. - I will call them. - They'll come for you. - Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them? What's up? I don't feel good when I'm on them. - Mom, I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without it. - You got to take your medication. Mom, it makes me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look. Why don't you just take the medication? - Come on. I'm doing it with my physicality. - Take you medication. I've been working out, that's what I'm doing. - Why is he wearing a garbage bag? - Why are you wearing a garbage bag? - To sweat. - Sit down. Come on. Sit down. We're 7 minutes in, no score. Come on, help turn the juju around. I don't believe in juju, Dad. Come on, Mr. Excelsior. You wanna be positive? Be positive. - Sit down. Come on. Thank you. - All right, all right, all right. For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game. - He says you're good luck, honey. - What's that in your hand? It's a... - See? - Handkerchief? - Yeah. And they give it to DeSean Jackson, who takes it downfield... That's OCD. That's crazy. What OCD? I want my son to watch the game with me, so sue me. Now, sit down. Sit down, come on! I want you to watch the game with me. - I do, but that's not the point. - I'm not superstitious. That's a small thing that I do. If I make a lot of money, what's the difference if I do this or that? - It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on. - Come on. - I'm making crabby snacks and homemades. - Sit, sit, sit. Come on. Touchdown! You see? You see that? You're meant to be here. This is special. Everything happens for a reason. That's why you came home. Embrace it. Embrace it. - I'm the reason? I don't think so, Dad. - Yeah? Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. - I got your whole sheet. Yup. - Mom! No, no, no. I'm just confirming. I'm just confirming. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Can I do an interview for a school projetc on mental illness? - No! - Come on. It's a school project. - Don't pay any attention. - Who was that? Is that? He's not Rick D'Angelo, is he? - That's him. - Don't let them make you feel bad. - Is he the guy who's having the problem? - Yeah, that's the one. - People are stupid. They don't know what they're saying. Don't let them hurt your feelings. Patrick! - Pat, don't look for Nikki! - Get out of here with that fucking camera. - Patrick, please! - Pat! - Patty! Patty! - Don't look for Nikki! [Always Alright by Alabama Shakes] - Miss Metgers! - Oh, God! Oh, God! Nance! It's my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday. How are you? - Hey! - What are you doing here? I just came by to say hi, let you know I'm ready to come back to work. - You shouldn't be here. - I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll work, I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want. Let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude. - I got it. I got it. - Let me just ask you something. - Does Nikki still work here? - You know I can't tell you that. - But Doug Culpepper is still here. - Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What do you do, be a troublemaker? You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight? I did. Yeah, I did. Thank you. - Get away from me! Get away! - What, what, what? - Okay, okay, all right. I'm better. - Get away. - I just wanna let you know I'm better now. - Get away. - Okay? I'm better. - All right. Yeah. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look how clear they are. - Don't hug me. - I'm not a complainer anymore, I'm positive guy, okay? - You just have to give it some time. - Yes. You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. - It'll be all good. It'll work out. Yeah. - Yes, it will be! I'm gonna take that a silver development, Nancy. A silver development! - That's a silver lining. - Good luck. Ronnie! Pat! - There he is! He's back! - Hey. - Welcome home. - Thank you. - Welcome back, man. - Yeah, I'm out. - Yeah, you're "out" out? - Uh-huh. Cool, man! Wow, you lost a lot of weight. - I almost didn't recognise you. - Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't visit you at the hospital. You know, work's out of control. You know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I miss you. I really need someone to talk to. You got to come see the baby. She's beautiful! And Veronica wants to make dinner for you. Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation. 'Cause you think Veronica still hates you? - I know Veronica still hates me. - That's not true. Yes, it is. Nikki always said that Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, at her purse. - That's not true. - Ronnie! - What are you doing? - Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong. Because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner, hmm? - Did you invite him? - Yes! Well, can he make it? I don't know yet! - Can you make it next Sunday? - Sure. I'll see you next Sunday. Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? - Does Veronica still talk to Nikki? - Yeah. - Get in here, please. I need you. - Okay. As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitchout to Randal El. Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game. You're in this house, please, show some respect for what I do. And we should spend time together anyway. I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please. I have very, very good news, everybody. Very good news. What's that? What's the good news? - Things are looking up. - Oh, are they? I knew why they invited me over. I know. - Listen, she might be with that guy. The... - Oh, no way! - No, she might be with him. - No way, Dad. No way. - She's afraid of you. She doesn't wanna talk to you. - Doug Culpepper? - Put the phone down. - What are you just doing? - Put the phone down, please. - What are you doing? - Stop. - Look, look! Dad, Dad! - Dad! This is my life. - Give me the phone. - Give me the phone. - Pat! - You gotta understand me. You're gonna go back! - Don't talk to me like that. - Then stop this! Then don't fucking do this! - Don't yell at me like that. Well, then don't behave this way! I got a call asking to check on this house. - Pat Solatano? Yeah? - Yeah. Mrs. Solatano, Mr. Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I workd this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favour. Respect the restraining order, okay? 500 feet. You hear what he just said? You have a restraining order. - Yeah, Dad, I know. - Thank you, officer. If you need anything, my card. - Thank you. Sorry. We understand. - Since when do cops have cards? Tell me one thing, would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital, hmm? So, take your medication, and if you do fine, we'll reduce them. Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape, and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication. Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and see if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one. - Let me just say something. I'm gonna say something. - Okay. This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can. You have to work your hardest. And if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining. - Work on a strategy, okay? - All right. My friend Ronnie is having this party on Sunday night, and it's like a real hoity-toity thing, and his wife Veronica's a real stickler for... My Mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles. - Which jersey? - DeSean Jackson. DeSean Jackson is the man. Well, that settles that. Pat! What are you doing? - I gotta go, man. - Why? I can't stay. Come on, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have worn this. Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. - I wish I was wearing that jersey. - I feel like an idiot. Are you comfortable? - Veronica's not gonna like it. - Get over here. - Plus you got a tie. - Don't worry about it. You're the guest of honour. You come however you wanna come. - Really? - Get over here. DeSean Jackson's in the house! - You mean rookie of the year? - Yeah! DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner. - Isn't it awesome? - Not for dinner. - Look, he got us flowers. - Oh! That's sweet. That's sweet, Pat. - That's lovely. - And wine. - Hey. - Look at the baby! Check this out. We just redid the whole thing. - Wow! Tremendous! - Isn't it great? - Tremendous! - Yeah, man. - I'm thinking of redoing it again. - Why? - Because! You're making it awkward. - You're making a lot of paper to do that. Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain. - Isn't the market down on? - It is down. But, you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man. You know, my dad lost his pension. - I'm sorry, man. A lot of people, man. - Yeah. - My uncle too. - Really? Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike. You start snapping up commercial real estate, cheap! Flip it over, you flip it over, and that's when you make the money. But the pressure! Man, it's like... - You okay? - I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and... - Crushed by what? - Everything. The family, the baby, the job. The fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know... Like, I'm trying to do this, you know, and then I'm, like, suffocating. Holy shit! You can't be happy all the time. Who told you you can't be happy? It's all right. You just do your best. You have no choice. - That's not true at all. - You just can't. Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie! I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that? - Who? - Veronica's sister. - Tiffany. Tiffany and Tommy? - Tiffany. Yeah. Just Tiffany. - What happened to Tommy? - He died. - Tommy died? - Cops die. - How'd he die? - Please, don't bring it up. - No, how did he die? - I just said-- How did who die? Hey, Tiffany. This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany. You look nice. - Thank you. - I'm not flirting with you. - Oh, I didn't think you were. - I just see that you made an effort. I'm gonna be better with my wife. I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I'm gonna do that now. 'Cause we're gonna be better than ever, Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die? What about your job? - I just got fired, actually. - Oh, really? How? I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen? Does it really matter? Baby, how's it going? - Great, great. - Everyone having fun? Oh, I love flowers. Oh, baby, can we show them the house? Please, please, please... - The whole house? - The whole house. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it'll be fun. It'll be fun. We're gonna go on a tour now. - Let's go see the house. - We're gonna go on a tour, come on. - Come on, Pat. Let's go for the tour. - I just wanna show it. Seriously... I've been planning this forever. I love our house. I love our house. - I'm really excited about it. - Come on. - Guess what it is. - Oh, it's a television. - It's a... computer screen. - Nope. - Keep going, keep going, keep going. - It's a brick oven. It's a brick oven. - It's a light... - Warmer, warmer, warmer. - It's a drawer of a morgue... - Don't think so hard. - ...where they pull out dead bodies... - Don't think so hard. - ...and they shoot them with formaldehyde. - If it were for a dead body... ...where would the body go though? - Is it aside to the kitchen? - It's a joke! It's a... fireplace. In the middle of the wall? We have a port in every room. Give me an iPod. - Who doesn't have an iPod? - I don't have a phone. Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki. - Don't worry about it. - I would call Nikki. I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. Give me your iPod. Give it to me. Thank you, baby. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in... - Look, look, look! ...I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom. I can play music for the baby in any room. You play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica? Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president. He knows them all. Here's a fun fact. You know where the term okay comes from? No. No, I don't. Where? Well, Martin Van Buren, the 8th president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York. And he was part of a club, a men's club called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." 'Cause you were in the Old Kinderhooks. - Really? - Yeah. - Pretty cool, right? - That's interesting. You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years, and she's real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel. Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance. Why do you have to talk about me like that? I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister? - Don't talk about me in the third person. - Please, give me a break. - I'm right here. - Just be nice. Just be nice. - Wow, wow, wow! Fascinating! - Sorry, I don't wanna be mean. I know. I know. I know. - What meds are you on? - Me? None. I used to be on lithium, and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated. Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped. - You ever take Klonopin? - Klonopin, yeah! - Right? - Jesus! - Like, "What? What day is it?" - Yeah. - How about trazodone? - Trazodone? It flattens you out. I mean, you are done! - It takes the life right out of your eyes. - God, I bet it does. - I'm tired. I wanna go. - No, no, no. We haven't... We haven't even finished the salad yet or the duck... I made the fire and ice cake. I said I'm tired. Are you gonna walk me home or what? You mean me? Yeah, you. You gonna walk me home? You've poor social skills. You've a problem. - I've a problem? - Mm-hm. You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people. - I tell the truth. You're mean. - What, I'm not telling the truth? Maybe I should drive them home separately? No, you can drive them both home, now. - Stop talking about me in third person. - You can take Tiffany... - You love it when I have problems. - You can take Tiffany home first. You love it. You love it, Von. 'Cause then you can be the good one. - Just say it. - No, I don't. I don't. - I just wanted to have a nice dinner. - God! What is your problem? Nothing's my problem. I'm fine, I'm tired, I wanna go. Come on, are you ready? - You really wanna go right now? - Yes, I really wanna go. - It's been great. - Okay, okay, guys, the baby is sleeping. - Sorry, I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye. - Sorry, man. This is me. Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage, so I don't really remember how this works. How what works? I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it. Don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner, because I hate football, but you can fuck me, if you turn the lights off, okay? How old are you? Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital. Look, I had a really good time tonight, and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay? You're married! So am I. No, that's confusing. He's dead. Wait, what? What's happening? Oh, my God! Hey. [What Is and What Should Never Be by Led Zeppelin] Are you okay? Ronnie called. - Hey, is that makeup on your shirt? - I don't know, Mom. - Whoa. What happened over there? - When am I gonna get a phone? - You'll get a phone in due time. What happened? - Pat! Mom, Mom, Mom, I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up. - What is it? - Where's my wedding video? It's after 3 o'clcok! What are you doing? I looked in here, but this is all your shit up here for your sewing and everything. - Did you put it up here? - What about in your father's study? - Don't go in my study. - Dad, not now! Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here. Patty, what are you doing? He's got all his Eagles videos. I need the one video of my wedding. - Is it here? I mean where is it? - Patty! It's probably in the attic. Are you going in my study? It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video, Mom. - You think I can't handle it? - Please stop yelling! I'm not yelling, Mom I'm just frustrated, because I should have my fucking wedding video! Pat! Pat! - You're gonna wake everybody up! - I looked over there. - I already looked all over there. - It is somewhere! - It's not here! - Calm down, Pat! I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck! I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up! - I'm not ashamed of it! - Pat! - I'm not ashamed of it! - Stop it! Let the whole neighbourhood wake up! I don't care! - Stop it! Stop it! - No, Mom! - What's going on? - Lower it down! - What? Hey! - Stop it! - It's my wedding! It's my wedding video! - Pat, stop it, stop it, stop it! Oh, I can't watch a video? No! I can hear the fucking song in my head! Stop! - Mom? Mom? - What the fuck you doing?! - You throw your mother on the floor! - No, no, no, no, no. Stop it! - Get off me, Dad! - Stop hitting him! - I'm not doing anything! - Stop hitting him! Patrizio, don't hit him! - I'm not hitting him! - Stop it! - He's hitting me! - Stop it, Dad! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Police! Open the door, please. Open up. Mr. Solatano, I got a lot of calls. People in the neighborhood are scared. I gotta come in. How are we doing in here, huh? We got a lot of reports from your neighbours, all right? - Oh, you got to be... No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. - We got a lot of phone calls... Nikki is being manipulated and controlled, and you have to talk to her. - Hey, sit down. - Officer... - Listen, you gotta stop with these crazy theories. - You're the one with problem. Nobody else. - He's a cop. What are you doing? - It's a medication problem. - But he's fine. - Yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore? We know all about the explosion at the phyciastrist's office. - What explo...? No. - What? Cliff is lying. That's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that. Jesus Christ, who's that? - Keep an eye on him. - You don't need to know anything about this. Is this a bipolar episode? Get out of here, little fucking idiot! - Get out of here! - Someone help me! Help me! - You can't tell Nikki about this, officer. - Look, I had to make out a report... - ...she's gonna see it by law. - No, no, no. - Hey, hey, sit down! - No, listen, sir. He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help Me! - Sit down! - I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter, and you can just let me five minutes... - She has a court order against you, - ...to explain how much better I'm doing. 500 feet. Listen to me! When I take that fucking camera, and I'm gonna break it over your fucking head, then I'm gonna come back and interview you about what it's like to get that fucking camera broken over your head! What are you laughing about? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. - I'm sorry. Stop all that fucking noise. Go back to sleep, the party's over. Show's over. This is not a reflection of where I'm at. Please, you can't tell her any of this. - You can't tell Nikki about this. - You need to pipe down. - Everything all right? - Who was at the door? - Who was that, Dad? - It was that kid with the camera. Good luck. I gotta write this up. Come on, don't write it up. I don't want her to see this. It's okay. Everything is okay. We're fine. Thank you, we appreciate it. Tell him, "Thank you." [Buffalo by Alt-J] - Hey! - Whoa! Hey! What the hell? - What happened to your face? - Weight lifting accident. That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night? Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off. This is my neighbourhood. You just ran by my house. - I like to run by myself, okay? - Me too. - Hey, I like to run alone. Will you stop, okay? - What? - I'm running here. - Me too! Well, then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking tons of roads to run in. What are you trying to do? - I like this road. This is my neighbourhood. - Oh, come on, please! Calm down, crazy. Why...? Damn it! - Hey! - What the fuck?! - I'm married! - So am I! What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead! - Where is your wife? - You're crazy? I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital, Baltimore. I'm not the big slut! I'm sorry. I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker? Can you forgive? Are you any good at that? You seem to have trouble last night. Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake, and I hate myself for it. And I hate my illness. And I wanna control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return, because I could've killed him. And I didn't. He's 65 years old. Don't you think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean... He was scared for your mother, and you hurt him as well. Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best. Pat, you have to have a strategy, I told you earlier. You need to recognise these feelings coming to you. Otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So, when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place with peace with yourself, however you can. - Yeah, but that's easier said than done. - You have to do it. You have no choice. - Excelsior. - Yeah, excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay? - No. - Why? Because you have a restraining order. What good are you, man? Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night? Oh, I don't know. Because I'm married, and I haven't seen my wife in 8 and a half months. And you think that Nikki's not around, and Tiffany's an attractive girl, and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you? Not bad, Dr Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki, because Tiffany is a slut. - Why is she a slut? - After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote... "We can go to the back house, and you can fuck me, "as long as we turn the lights out." ...unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut. Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought that if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her. She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself, and can I say the same? Can you? - Is that a...? You're asking...? - Yeah. - You're really asking me that question? - Yes. With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts? Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This crazy sad shit, as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful, positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out and reading books. No, no. Not the books. You said Nikki is friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So, if you become friends with Tiffany, Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So, if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you. Trick or treat? Trick or treat? - Hey! - Whoa! - How do you know when I run'? - I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. Did you hear what I said? Why are you giving me such a hard time? No, I'm not giving you a hard time. I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit. You wanna have dinner at this diner? Pick me up at 7.30. [Unsquare Dance by The Dave Brubeck Quartet] - Trick or treat? - Wait up! Oh, I've got a king-size. Look! - Happy Halloween. - Hi. - Here you go. - Thank you. - I'm gonna get a bowl of your Raisin Bran. - Great. Tea. Be right back. You look nice. Thanks. Raisin Bran. And some milk for you. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. Do you wanna share this? Why did you order Raisin Bran? Why did you order tea? Because you ordered Raisin Bran. I ordered Raisin Bran, because I didn't want there to be any mistaking it for a date. - It can still be a date, if you order Raisin Bran. - It's not a date. So, how's your thing going, dancing thing? It's good. How's your restraining order? I wouldn't actually call the restraining order my thing, but getting back with Nikki is, and I think I'm doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office. And the so-called incident with the weights. Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki, because it was minor. And I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control. And that I'm actually... I'm doing really well. I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister. It would be so amazing, if you could get a letter to Nikki from me. I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing. But you would do it? I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family. You should hear how I lost my job. How'd you lose your job? By... having sex with everybody in the office. Everybody? I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people. - We don't have to talk about it. - Thanks. - How many were there? - 11. - Wow! - I know. - I'm not gonna talk about it anymore. - Okay. Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women? - Yes. - Really? Yes. - What was that like? - Hot. Jesus Christ! Was it like older women, a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you...? Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah. - What? You sat on her lap? - Mm-hm. - She told you what to do? - Mm-hm. Oh, my God! Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a perv. - Maybe we should change the subject. - I don't mind it. - You don't, do you? - No. But then people were getting in fights in the parking lot at work and in the bathroom. And the boss called me into his office and tried to pin it all on me. So, I accused him of harassment. And then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds. I get it. The song that was playing when my wife was in the shower with the history teacher... I heard about that. ...is my wedding song. When I hear it, I go kind of crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing. - Wow! - Yeah. - So, they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of. - Yeah. - So, I know. - Mm-hm. I just gotta get a strategy, you know? Me too. - We better get back to the letter. - Yeah, let's get back to the letter. What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom? Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that. Oh, my God! I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now. Can I at least finish my tea? - Wait, what? - My tea. Can I finish it? Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test? I kind of got that feeling, yeah. Goddamn it! I knew it! It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well. Yeah, she said you were cool, basically. Basically? Was I some percentage not cool? No, she said you were cool, but, you know... No, I don't know. Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax. What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean? Sort of like me. Sort of like you?! I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that! - Why? - Because... It's just not right. Lumping you and I together, it's... I mean, it's just wrong, and Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me. You think that I'm crazier than you. Because... We're different, I mean... Oh, my God! Ugh! You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. 'Cause that must have been fucking crazy, because I'm so much crazier than you. Keep your voice down. I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband! - Forget it! - Shut the fuck up. Fuck you! - You shut the fuck up. - Tiffany! Hey, Tiffany! Slow down, Raisin Bran. Hey! Hey, come on! - Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right? - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. - You told your therapist... - ...that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you? - What? - Hey, calm down! Hey! - Just leave me alone! Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behaviour, because I've never done anything like that, okay? You may not have experienced the shit that I did, but you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive. You are afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you, and you judged me. You are an asshole. - You are an asshole. - Hey, hey, hey, calm down. - Get off of me! - Calm down. - Get off! You're harassing me! - Hey, hey. - He's harassing me! - Shut up! Get off! - Dude... Man, take it easy. - Bro, take off me. - Dude, relax. - Take off me, right there. - He's harassing me! - Bro, bro, get off me, dude. - He's harassing me! - Hey, hey, stop it. You back off, all right? Calm down! - Go home! - Fuck off! Get off of me. Shut up, shut up. Stop it. Shut up! [My Cherie Amour by Stevie Wonder] - Hey, hey, hey, hey, get off me. - What are you doing? Come on, what are you doing? What are you doing to these kids? You wanna be a punk on Haloween with these kids? You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do? Come on, Solatano! What did these kids do to you? You're begging to go back to Baltimore, you know that, right? What's the matter with you, huh? - You're sick! - It's the kids. It's the kids. Honestly, he didn't do anything. It was all the kids. They started it. He didn't do anything. Come on, man. Come here. What are you gonna do about that song, huh? You're gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's a song. Don't make it a monster. Come on, breathe. There's no song. There's no song. There's no song playing. That's it. That's it. Do it more. There you go. - Move it out. Let's go. Let's go. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Keep going! - I took it too far. Hey, was he messing with you? No, no, this was just a joke. - This is a joke I started. - Don't think I'm a loser. No, no, no. - I'm not. I'm not. It was just a joke. - There's a restraining order on this guy. - I know. I have a stupid sense of humor. - That's not a good thing to do. Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry. - You're Tommy's widow, right? - Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow. Minus the whore thing for the most part. You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime? - What'd I say? - She doesn't do that anymore. - I'm sorry about what I said at the diner. - I know. - I know you didn't mean it. - I didn't mean it at all. - I know you say shit you don't mean all the time. - All the time. I'll still give your letter to Nikki. Don't worry. Wow! Oh, I really appreciate that, Tiffany. - I know you do. - You do? Yeah, sure. I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter? I'll bet I know what happened, if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope, and one of them took it. - It's the only answer. - No, no, no. Dolores, somebody was in my study. Who took one of my envelopes? Somebody took an envelope. Maybe we should call the FBI. No, don't make fun. It's serious. What FBI? Come on, take a look. I'll show you what this is. I'm gonna just explain to you something. You know what I'm doing, honey. This is everything... Like this. I got this. It all corresponds... Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. - I hope that's not a problem. - No, it's not okay. - It's not okay! - Whoa! - "Do not go in my study... - You gotta ask. - "... or I will eat you." - It's not funny. It's not funny. What's everybody making a joke out of this for? Dolores, you are so beautiful! Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop. Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games, a lot of cash in them, so show some respect for what I do. Yeah, I know. I saw 274. - I just wanna tell you the number. - Thank you. But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't wanna wake you, but I needed an envelope. You didn't wanna wake me? He didn't wanna wake me. He doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway. - He doesn't have a problem... - Be nice. - ...asking for his wedding video. - It's game day. - I'm making crabby snacks and homemades. - Yeah, Dad, come on, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades! Come on, Dad! What are you so up about? - You're very happy. - I'm happy. - No, you're so up, up, up, up. - Isn't that a good thing? You're just up, up, up, up. I don't know what that is. Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication? Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am. Okay. Taking a little bit too many or something? No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad. Just stay with us. Stay for the game. Spend some family time. Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go. - What do you mean? - Spend family time. You mean OCD superstitious time? Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out. - Come on. - I can't. It's the Seahawks. Put on the jersey and stay, please. - Dad! - Please. It's important, please. - What are you up to, Pat? - Nothing. Come on. What's in the envelope? Yeah, what do you do? What's in that envelope? Guys, I'm beating the song. I'm on the scoreboard. I'm playing downfield. I feel great! Tiffany! Hey, hey, how're you doing? ls Tiffany here? - What do you want with her? - Is that another creep? - What do you want, creep? Just beat it. - Whoa, whoa, no. No, no, no, no. No, I'm married. - Oh, great! A married creep! - I'm her friend. We go running. Have you guys not seen it? - I took her to the diner... - She's not here. Hey, guys. How's it going? Hey. ls Tiffany home? Go away! - I know her. - What are you doing here? I know her. We've dated. We still date. - I've called her, I texted her. - You know this guy? I still haven't heard back. - Used to work together. - Just get the hell out of here! I just wanna give you my card to give to her. - Another rude one! - Listen to what he's saying. - What's he saying? - He's saying you're being rude. - How am I being rude? - You know, you know. Come on. Look, sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun. And sometimes it's not, because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. In this case, this particular case, I think that that wing is being fixed, my friend. And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're getting in the way of that right now. Okay? Because she's sensitive. And she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl. You gotta be respectful to that. Come on, let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. Look, I can see it in your eyes. She just texted me! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you won't take the letter? You weren't outside. - What the hell's going on? - I can't do it. What do you mean you can't do? You can't do what? I can't give the letter to Nikki. Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean, you can't give the letter to Nikki? Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me? You said... You said if I wrote a letter... - ...you'd get it to Nikki. - I know. - That was a set-up? - Because I do this. Time, after time, after time, I do all this shit for other people. And then I wake up and I'm empty, I've nothing. What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. You just do things on your own. I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever and ever... I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. All right, well, ask for you. What can I do for you? I can't do it. Tiffany, what do you want me to do? - Think of something. - There's this thing. There's a thing. Okay, what kind of thing? It's a thing. It's a thing. It's a dance thing. It's a dance thing, all right. It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. - Tommy would never do it... - Well, Tommy's dead... - ...so he's not gonna fucking do it. - ...and I missed it every single year. - Would you please...? - No, I don't have a filter when I talk. - I know you don't have a filter. - I don't have a filter when I talk, all right? - Can we have one fucking conversation without you... - Yes! - ...reminding me of my goddamn husband? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Okay, I'm sorry. - Oh, my God! But I can only do it if I have a partner. And now I'm about to miss it for another year. I'm not gonna fucking dance for you! What are you talking about? What? Your schedule is so busy? 'Grapes of Wrath' and watching football with your dad? - Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you. - All right, I'm not giving your fucking letter. Wait a second. You promised you would do this. Think about it. Well, I already did do something for you, you know. What did you do for me? I took care of that jerk-off that was in front of your house. - What, Jordie? - Let me ask you something. You call him when you're lonely? That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it. Can you say the same about you and Nikki? It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different. How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it. I wanna understand it. We have a very unconventional chemistry. Makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with. - Wow! - It's electric between us. Okay, yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal. Couples wanna do that. I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, which both I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. - She always wanted the best for me. - Wow! She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing, you know? I just... Look, I'm my best self today. And I think she's her best self today. And our love's gonna be fucking amazing. It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So, think about the dance thing. Clearly went on a roll there. McNabb got hot in the first half, nine consecutive... Danny, you're out of the hospital? - And you're here on game day? - I'm out. It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two-thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They couldn't... They had to let me go. - I never understand what he's saying. - Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on. Let's come back and sit down the way you were before. - What a treat! - Let's do it. - Dad's got you sitting here?! - Oh, yeah. He calls me "jailhouse lawyer". - Hold the remote the way you were holding it before. - Okay. - And now you're holding the remote? - And it's working. Your dad's a genius. Now, sit up, like... - And Danny's a good luck charm! - Danny's from you. This is your house, so it comes down to you. You're the one. - Yeah, you're the one, Pat. - Superstition, Danny, I don't know. Come sit down. Don't disappear doing God knows what with that Tiffany Maxwell. - Dad, Dad, Dad! - Sit down. She's my friend. Why would you say that? Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She does a lot of therapy. I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say? - I'm just saying-- - Am I messed up? You stop judging people. You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed-up marriage. - I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable. - What's wrong with your marriage? - Nothing! Nothing's wrong. - Quiet! You should see when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it. - Stop breaking my balls. - I'm not breaking your balls. - I brought you the iPod. - Oh, whoa! - Is this for me? - Yeah. - Well, that's my old iPod, but... - Buddy, thank you. - That's so nice of you. - I want you to have it. - Wow! - 32 gigabytes. - How many songs is that? - 7,000! Oh, yeah, you got the Stranglers. You love the Stranglers. - Oh, the Sex Pistols! The Clash. - Got some Clash. - Oh, 'West Side Story'! - Yeah, 'West Side Story'. - It makes me peaceful. - 'West Side Story'? - # Maria, just met a girl named Maria # - Right, right, right. And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage. Metallica, Megadeth. I start fucking smashing shit. - You got to get your marriage together. - I start breaking shit. And I hurt my hand and I... - Ronnie, that's fucked up. - Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know? When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that. Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki? Restraining order's nothing to fool with, bro. Holy shit, look at you! You are ripped! You look absolutely amazing! You feel good? - How're you doing, Jake? - Good. You look like Schwarzenegger, man, in his prime. - Shit! - Didn't I say you wouldn't recognise him? So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know, those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanded. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant, 'cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money he's making with his bookmakers, they're gonna come after him. And it looks like that I'm gonna make partner at the firm. Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm. Stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him. Just, you know, leave it alone. Leave it alone. We're watching the game. You know what? I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth. As my friend Danny would say... I got nothing but love for you, brother. - That's right. That's right. - That's nice. That's nice. Thank God, finally. - DeSean Jackson. - Yeah. Did it fit? - Yeah, wore it to Ronnie's for dinner. - Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey. - Veronica didn't like it. - Veronica hates the jersey. Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay? - Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble. - You're up to something, I know. People like Tiffany, or Danny or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Do you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something... - We have a sixth sense. - ...'cause we're more... I mean, everybody got it. Everybody's just not in touch with it. Oh, no! - How're you doing, Pat? - Oh, Jesus! I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him that cops were coming. - I'm taking him back to the hospital. - Why? No, no, he passed his thing, right? First of all, check with the latest legal development. We got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence. So... Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan? - I'm an Eagles fan. - Well then, what's the problem? He's not going anywhere. Just let him finish the game. That's all. The handkerchief is working. We're killing the Seahawks, 27-10. What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please! I don't know what the hell you're talking about the handkerchief. And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing, and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, all right? He can contest his case from Baltimore. Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I used insurance money to build this. I designed it. - Wow! - All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers. I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good, 'cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing. - Where do you sleep? - Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here. When are you gonna give it to her? What? The letter to Nikki. - Probably tonight. - Really? Ronnie, Veronica and I, we're gonna see her tonight. And actually, I changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare, and how he's very romantic, and that maybe in the future, if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the training that we'll do. - That's good. That's really good. - I assume that you're a good teacher. - Yeah. I certainly hope so. - Maybe you can teach us both. You know what I mean? And I also mentioned how you were gonna... - ...how generous it is, what I'm doing for you. - Yeah. - Mm-hm. It's really generous. - It's being of service. - Yeah. - To your need. - Uh-huh. All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room. Can we do something else besides the dance deal? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something? A deal is a deal. I know! Okay! I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario. Why don't you... walk towards me like I'm Nikki? And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk. - I'm not doing it. - Only walk. - I'm not doing it. - Do it. - No. That's stupid. - No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on. You're not Nikki. Don't look up until you're halfway here. That's right. Not yet. Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion. I don't feel anything. Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died? No. We were married for 3 years and 5 days, and I loved him. But for the last couple of months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different, and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids, and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway, one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76th to help a guy with a flat tyre and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. That's a feeling.

Slow down. - What? Your father wanted you to have this. He wants me to have all Eagles information. It's his living. Tell Dad thanks. Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat. Football stays out of this place. So does 'Lord of the Flies'. Wait, no, no, no! What are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus. I don't give a fuck! What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey! - You just throw that outside? - Well, you're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the 'Lord of the Flies'. It's a bunch of boys on an island, and they have a conch, they have a shell. And whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy, and they're really mean. And then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty, and there's no silver lining. Wow! That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though. Who's that? Hello? What the hell? What are you doing here, man? If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole adjudication is thrown out. - How'd you know we were here? - I went by your parents' house looking for you... - ...and they told me you was over here. - Oh, Danny, this is Tiffany. - Tiffany, this is Danny. - Pat told me about you. - So, is this the girl you wrote about? - Yeah. What? You wrote about me? I'm "the girl"? - He wrote about you, all right. - What did he say? He said you guys was helping each other out, and you were nice. And you had a mouth on you, but... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay. - A little mouthy. Please, tell me more about what he said in the letter. Anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you in the letter. It was nothing about it. - It was just a very general letter. - Cool. - She's fine. - She is my friend with an "F". - A capital "F". She's fine. - For a friend. Can I see what you guys are doing? - Yeah. - Okay. - One, two. - I like it, I like it. - Do you? - It's good, yeah. And then this goes into something else. - That's it? - Why? What is it? What is it? What is it? - Can I say something? Do you mind? - No. - You sure? - Just say it. Say it. - No, please. I think, Pat, you should be facing Tiffany. Let me show you, Pat. Let me you what I mean. You gotta come with a little bit more soul, man. You should move some more hips. You should come in like this. Okay. Yeah. Can you move a little bit more hip? Yeah, that's it. Move a little bit more. You could turn around too. There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. You're pretty good. Yeah. Exactly. - Yeah. - Okay, we got it, we got it. - Okay, I'll switch with you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it. Come on, Pat. Come on. A little bit more soul, Pat. - Black it up, Pat. - What does that mean? - You know damn well what it means. - "Black it up"? Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Oh! Oh, man! Oh! I got an idea. [Silver Lining by Jessie J] Jump up. Hold hands. Circle around and round and round. Don't look back. Come get some, Pat. - Is that it? - That's it. Bounce, bounce. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta move your junk. Pop. Pop your butt. Pop it. I gotta get out of here. I gotta see this girl, Tanya. She lives on the other side of the town. - Yeah, go see Tanya. - Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win. - Okay. - Bye. - Excelsior, Pat! - Excelsior! That's my man. Let's go. Patty. Patty. Hey, Patty. Pat. Huh? Patty. Where have you been? Huh? We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that. We gotta beat the Giants, if we wanna have any chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you realise that? I didn't realise that. Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I mean, I think it would be wise, if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good-luck thing that you're in. - Okay. - Yeah? - Right. - Hmm? I just wanted to... Maybe I didn't... spend enough time with you growing up. I spent too much time with your brother. It might've made you feel worse about your behaviour, but I didn't know anything. I didn't know how to handle it. I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about. It's about us spending time now. And I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet. That's the whole point. Yeah. I wish you'd watch these games with me. So we could talk, we could get into things. So, look, will you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now, huh? Randy, tell him what I'm doing. He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything. All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game. Tell him why. Because he believes in you. - Is that true? - I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that. So, I'm gonna bet heavy on this game. - You understand? Heavy. - Yeah. I want you to go to the game with your brother. - You want me to go to the game with Jake? - Of course I do. - Does he want me to go? - Of course he wants you to go. - He told you that? - He told me, yes. - With all his friends? - With all his friends. He trusts you. - He's not embarrassed? - No. I'd love to go to the game too, but, as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. 'Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole. Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. Randy! As a matter fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game. Randy! I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavour. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe. I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, so... And it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's... I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing. What is this thing you're doing? Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon? It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear. Listen, I need to ask you something. Tomorrow, can I spend half the day with you anf half the day at the Eagles game? I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that. Why? These are the two days that you have promised me, and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet, and we don't have the move yet. I know, but my dad opened up to me, and it was really beautiful, and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up, and he's concerned that's because I'm spending time with you. Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju? No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up, because I'm not with him during the games. - Guess what. - What? Nikki replied to your letter. But you can't read it until after you nail the big move. Go. Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else till I can read Nikki's letter, okay? It's just keeping... It's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right? - I just hope you can handle it. - Thank you. What was her energy when she gave it to you? She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared. She was scared? About what? Did she tell you? Try to stay positive. I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's... - Is that too much to ask? - No. - I thought you were gonna read it out loud. - Okay. I'm sorry. "Dear Pat... "It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, "but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. "This gives us a chance to communicate, "while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. "I must admit you sound terrific, and I'm happy that you're feeling so positive "and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. "I was moved to read about "Excelsior" and your belief in happy endings. "I'm also moved by your act of love to read the books I've taught at high school. "I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. "I think they're great works of art that reflect how hard life can be. "And they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. "In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, "I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something "to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. "Otherwise, I find myself thinking that "we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. "Please, don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. "I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." I think I'm done today, okay? She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would've never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels, focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her. Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? E-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles! Can I use your phone? - Is it an emergency? - Yeah, kind of. What kind of emergency? I'm just doing this project with Tiffany. I just wanna tell her I'm not gonna be on time. Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know? Look... She's not... I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad? That a bad thing? No, I think it's a good thing. Don't drink too much, don't hit anybody, and you'll be fine. Yeah, I'm solid. [Hello Operator by The White Stripes] - This is my little brother Pat. - Hey, how're you doing? Pat. Pat, what's this I hear about you just getting out? Yeah! From the loony bin! Guys, what the fuck?! I talked to you about that already. - I told you! - It's all right. He's a good dude. He's a good dude. Oh, shit! The Asian invasion. Every week! That's right, fool. We got this. No. - Jake, you better get your brother. - Cuckoo bird's taking off. - Cuckoo bird! - Dr Patel! - Hey, Pat! - Hey! What are you doing here? You know we must beat the Giants, my brother. I'm not supposed to be seeing you, right? - Outside the office. - Pat, Pat! Is that illegal? Pat, today I'm your brother in green, not your therapist. I'm so happy to see you. - Wonderful! Wonderful that you are here. - Jake! Jake! This is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff. Two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fucking Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass off the line of scrimmage. You can say that again. Those cocksuckers! [Hey Big Brother by Rare Earth] Okay. You know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica... - ...because she does. - I'll call Veronica. - But I don't wanna talk to Veronica. - Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica? Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it. You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line, and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment. - Enough with awkwardness! - You're right, man. I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say. No, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, man. Whoo! Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go! Whoo! - What the fuck? What's that smell? - What the hell is this, man? Nasty Indian curry. This is America, baby. Go back to your country. What? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's going on? Stay back, Pat. Stay back. Leave the fucking Indians alone. - Tough guy. - You're a traitor to your people. - Stay here. Stay here. Don't get in the fight. - I'm not gonna go in. They're fucking great! They're cool! I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight. We're the real Eagle fans. Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey! - Come on, get him, get him! - Get off my brother! Break it up or you'll be arrested! What'd you do? What happened? - Dad, Dad... - What the fuck happened? The Birds lose, I lose a fucking fortune. A fortune to Randy! What the fuck did you do? You fucking lost it! I thought you said you had it together, you were solid. I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid. I'm solid now. - You fell apart! What the fuck are you talking about? - Your son was trying to... - It's all fucking ruined now. It's all ruined. - No, Dad. - It's all fucking ruined! - Dad! No, Dad! - It's all fucking ruined! - Dad, don't do that! - It's all ruined, you little fucking shit! - No, Dad! Don't do this, Dad! - Come on, Dad! - You loser! You loser! - I'm not a loser. - You fucking loser! You spiked the ball at the one-yard line! He was defending his brother and us. You spiked the fucking ball at the one-yard line, you fucking idiot! - Who is this? Who's this? - We need to talk right now. When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up! Wait a second. I tried to call. - My God! What's heppening? - Who is this? - I called. I tried to call you, Tiffany. - What is this? - Oh, really? - Yes. I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you. And my dad was pulling me in one direction. - Dr. Patel, Ronnie... - That sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them. But all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way. - What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell? - It's no craziness. I told you who she was. I was doing this thing with her. - We had a conversation. - Fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her, it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here. You think I fucked up all the Eagles' juju, don't you? Ever since... Ever since he was with you. Ever since he was... - You think that I'm why today's happened? - That's right. You are why today's happened. - I'm the reason why today happened? - I think so. - Let's talk about that. - Be my guest. The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the 49ers handily, 40 to 26. The second time we got together, we went for a run, and the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 7 to 5 in the NLCS. - She's right, Dad. - The next time we went for a run... - ...the Eagles beat the Falcons, 27 to 14. - Wow! The third time we got together, we had Raisin Bran in the diner. And the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay, in the fourth game of the World Series, 10 to 2. Oh, wow! Let me think about that. Wait a minute. Why not think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, 14 to 7? - He was with you? - He was with me. - We went for a run. - Really? That's crazy! There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day. And if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants. She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts. Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the state of New York? Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know? - No. - No. Excelsior! - Look it up. - What? Really? - What? - Yeah! - Excelsior. - Oh, Pat! Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy, whose personal motto is "Excelsior", to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation. - Unbelievable! - Wow! How did you know all that stuff? I did my research. - I gotta say, I'm impressed. - Thank you. Yeah. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust her before, but I gotta say, now I do. Oh, now you like her, Dad? I have to say I do. Yup. Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil. Oh, fuck off, Randy! You love it. You live for this shit. - You've been betting against my father for years. - Is that right? - You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it! - That's bullshit! - That's not true. Don't say that. - You get off on it! - Fine, then prove it! - Yeah, prove it. How do you want me to prove it? - How do you prove it? - How do I prove it? How do I prove it? By giving them a chance to win back everything, double or nothing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Double or nothing on the Bengals next week, is that what you're saying? Mm-mm. Against the Cowboys. - Oh, come on, are you kidding? - That's his team. That's your team, isn't it, Randy? - I know who his team is. - When is the game? - December 28th, last game of the season. - Oh, my God! Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition. - Oh, God! - Randy... I thought they were America's team. Don't you believe in America's team? Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's team? Yeah, I believe in America's team. But if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing. - I like it. - No. No, Patrizio. I believe in the Eagles. I believe in my son. I'll take the action. I'll take it. - Dad. - Patrizio, don't. It's toxic! I have faith. I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house. - Dad. - Not in the state of New York. In this house. Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that the excelsior was the state motto of New York, okay? - I didn't know either, but now I know. - I know, but listen, this is toxic. - Dad, Dad, Dad... - Randy... - Dad, this is toxic. You shouldn't be doing this. - What do you say, Randy? - You shouldn't be doing this. - Be quiet. Shut up. You already did enough. Randy, what do you say? My Birds, Benjamin Franklin's team, favoured by one and a half points. I give you 3 more. Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet! - In fact, I'll give you 10 points. - No, Dad! - Dad! - Dad! This is insanity! What are you talking about? - You have to take that bet on the Cowboys. - Dolores, will you stop him? - Jesus! - Yeah! How could you not take that bet? Even with the 10 points I give you. That's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I bet you're such a coward, you won't take the 10. Plus... Are you listening? Plus, whatever their score is at the dance thing. - What's that? - What? - Tiffany, what's that? - No, no, no. You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous, I won't take that. However, wait a second. - I do like the idea of a parlay. - What? No parlay! No! - No. Don't do it. Don't do it. - Oh, Mother of God! Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything? I don't know. I don't know how they fucking score. We're participating. We're not a part of it. There's people that are high-end. This is a high-end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest, you have to average the four judges' scores. Okay, scores from 1 to 10, right? And you guys are how good? - We suck. - We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay. We're happy just to be going there. And how're the people you're competing against? They're good. Some of them are professionals. Better than you? - A lot better. - A lot better. So... If I was to say you only have to score 5, I would be really very generous, right? No, no, no. That would be amazing if we got 5. - Let's not get carried away. - Oh, come on! We can get a 5 out of 10. Give me a break! - We can't get 5. - Give me a break! You'll get a 5. You'll get a 5. - We can do a 5. - Dad, you haven't even seen us dance. - What are you talking about? - That's the parlay. Will somebody, please, explain me the parlay, please? You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the Birds gotta beat the Cowboys, plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a 5 at the dance. - That's very, very manic indeed. - That's the parlay. - We shook on it. - Shake on it. - No! Oh, God! - It's a bet. You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. Randy... Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out. - Pat, you can't quit. - I'm not doing the dance. I'm out. - Pat, calm down. - See you later. Think about... Pat, no! - What are you doing? - Pat! - I'm out. - What? - Here we are again at the one-yard line. - I am not happy. - DeSean... - I am not happy. ...snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. - There you go. - What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that connection you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore, okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on. I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry. You are not a stand-up guy right now! - If it's me reading the signs... - You reading the signs? Oh, okay! Pat! You are not a stand-up guy! I told you not to push it. Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing. He can't be a quitter. - He cannot be a quitter. He can't be a quitter. - You took that stupid parlay thing. And now he won't do the dance, and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it. There's only one way to get him to show. - What's that? - What's that? We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there. - She won't come. She can't come. - We have to tell him that she's coming. - We have to tell him that she's going. - But that's a lie! - That's a white lie! - That's a white lie. What does that matter? That's no big deal. So, it's a little lie. - No other way. - No. We gotta leave a trail of breadcrumbs, so that he can live his life without ruining it. No. I don't approve. - You can't do it. - Well, you know... I didn't approve when you called her and you told her where he was running, so she could ambush him. I didn't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway. That's it. We're gonna tell him Nikki will be there. - You gotta be part of it. - We have to do it. Aren't you nervous to be lying? Nah. A little bit. But it's for the best. "But if it was me reading the signs..." That's it. Okay. Hey! Hey, what's up? - Sorry I'm late. - It's fine.

Why are they so excited about a 5? Great. Good job. Thank you. You were amazing. - Thank you for coming. - Of course. - How are you? Are you okay? - I'm good. How are you? - I'm really good. Yeah, thanks, thanks. - You looked really happy out there. - Did I? Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Who'd have thought, dancing? - You look incredible. - Thank you, yeah. You lost a lot of weight. I've been reading your books and I have a positive attitude. I'm on medication and I'm in therapy. - Where's Tiffany? - She left. - What do you mean she left? - She left. - What do you expect? - Where is she? Let me tell you. I know you don't wanna listen to your father. I didn't listen to mine. But I'm telling you, you gotta pay attention to the signs. When life reaches out with a moment like this, it's a sin if you don't reach back. I'm telling you, it's a sin. If you don't reach back, it'll haunt you for the rest of your days like a curse. You're facing a big challenge in your life right now, this very moment, right here. And that girl loves you. She really, really loves you. And I don't know if Nikki ever did, but she sure as hell doesn't love you right now. And I'm telling you, don't fuck this up. I love you, Dad. Hey! - Would you just leave me alone? Please! - Wait a second! I have one more letter for you to read, okay? What the fuck is the matter with you? - Give it to her yourself! - Hey, let me say something. You don't ever have to see me again, if you just read it, all right? This is so fucked up. Yeah, just read it. "Dear Tiffany... "I know you wrote the letter. - "The only way you could meet my crazy..." - "... crazy was by doing something crazy yourself. "Thank you. "I love you. "I knew it the minute I met you. "I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. "I just got stuck. "Pat." I wrote that a week ago. - You wrote that a week ago? - Yes, I did. You let me lie to you for a week? I was trying to be romantic. You love me? Yeah, I do. Okay. The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed. And I can't begin to explain that. Or the craziness inside myself and everybody else, but guess what. Sunday is my favourite day again. I think of everything everyone did for me and I feel like a very lucky guy. We have to beat the Vikings by 3. I'm giving you a 6, which is very generous after the beating you just took. So, what are we doing? What are we talking about over here? I'd like to do another parlay, if you make it to the next round. That's all. Well, we are gonna make it to the next round. - Did you...? I laid that down. - No, no, I think I did. - No, that was me. - No, that was me. I played the jack. - No, I played the jack. - Did you play it? So, you put the breadcrumbs, the garlic in the steak, - and you roll it up with the toothpicks? - Yeah. For maybe three hours, plus. Everything's good, everything's good. Yeah, I got you, you're all down. Now, Randy, he's complaining, you know. He lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning. The restaurant's happening because of Randy, so everything's good.
