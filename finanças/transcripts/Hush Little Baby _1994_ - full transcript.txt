[EERIE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLING] [GASPING] [BABY COOING] Good morning. You're up early. I've got an 8:30 meeting at the hospital. Are you okay? You're warm. I had a bad dream, that's all. Same one? [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 8:30. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] MARTIN: Hon, my shirts are all wrinkled. What's going on? Meg did the laundry yesterday. I guess she forgot to press them. The laundry's never done. I mean... What does Meg do around here? Come on. She's terrific with the kids. Yeah. You know, I can depend on her when I'm in school. I trust her. Now, I know you'd like things a little more organized around here. I promise I'll talk to her. Meg's a little out there, but Dylan needs someone he can relate to. Well, he used to relate to me. Well, suddenly he's got a new mom, and a new baby brother. I think that's a lot to deal with. It's a lot for me to deal with. You know, before I met you, my life was so simple. And now it's so much better. [BABY CRYING] Our son calling. Dylan, your dad will hit the roof if he sees you eating cookies for breakfast. Let me have one. Like pancakes and syrup are good for you. Food goes in the mouth, Petey. Good morning. I thought we were gonna start eating a little healthier around here? Oatmeal, 100% wholegrain, no sugar. High fiber. Better than your cereal. Check out the ingredients. No fat, no cholesterol. I'll be darned. Meg, Martin and I won't be back until late tonight. We won't? Dinner with my parents, remember? Oh, right. Come on, Dylan, we're gonna be late. I'm gonna miss the ferry. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Oh. Hello. May I ask who's calling? Oh, okay. One moment. It's for you. Can I call back? I'm late for school. It sounds important. Private investigator calling long distance. Hello. Is this Susan Nolan? Yes. Your maiden name Owen? Yes, who is this? Your mother hired me to find you. My mother knows where I am. Not your adoptive mother, your real mother. You must have the wrong person. My natural mother's dead. You sure of that, honey? She looks pretty good to me. [LINE DISCONNECTS] Are you sure it's her? DETECTIVE: Same birth date, same hospital. There's no doubt she's your daughter. Um, the address is 36 Bay Street? Ms. Landon, I've repeated myself to you three times. Now I've got other clients. I've gotta go. Wait. When you talked to her... Well, did she seem happy? Did... Did she want to see me? It didn't sound like it to me. I'm sorry, I've gotta go. [STEADY TAPPING] Young man, could you come here just a minute, please? Can I see your toy, please? Oh. Thank you. [DOOR SHUTS] So, when you get your PhD, we'll have two doctors in the family. Doctor? I thought you were studying Art History. Well, Dad, that's my field of study, but the degree is Doctor of Philosophy. Hmm. I never could get these things straight. Darling, let me. You know, I got the strangest phone call this morning. This guy said he was a private investigator and that he was hired to find me. Is there something in your past I should know about? That's odd. Must have been a wrong number. No, he knew all about me. My maiden name... He even knew I was adopted. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] Did he say who was trying to find you? That's what's so creepy. My biological mother. I told him she was dead. Mom, what's wrong? What's going on? It's possible that your mother is still alive. You lied to me. How can you tell a small child that her mother gave her away? It seemed easier to say she had died. Easier for whom? Why didn't you tell me when I was older? Sweetheart, there just never seemed to be a right time. You've had my whole life. Susan, please. I don't feel very well. Martin, I'd like to go home now. I'll look after her. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi. Hello, sweetheart. Sorry to stop by unannounced, but we haven't heard from you since the other night. Come on in. What's, uh... What's all this? Your mother's been baking again. You know what she's like when she gets upset. Mom, you didn't have to do all this. You haven't called. Mom! I just need a few days to sort things out. What can you tell me about my biological parents? Sweetheart, it was... It was so long ago. The agency didn't tell us much. Why did she give me up? We don't know. We were only told that she wasn't capable of raising you. This came this morning. Is... Is it from her? What does it say? "Dear Susan, "I've been trying to find you all these years. "I've prayed that I get to see my beautiful baby grown into womanhood. "I hope that you will spare me a short visit. "A day, or even an hour of your time. "Your loving mother, Edie Landon." We're talking about a mother who abandoned a child. Are you sure you wanna meet her? Martin, I have to do this. She might not be what you expect. I'm doing this for me. We're running late. Oh, relax. You got plenty of time to make your flight. You look good. You don't think this is too casual? It's fine. What do you wear to meet your mother for the first time? [SIGHS] [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Susan. Come in. [TENDER PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] You're so beautiful. I don't know what to say. I don't even know what to call you. Well, uh... Just, uh, call me Edie. [SIGHS] Sit down, please. I... I made some tea for us. Or if you prefer coffee, I can make some. No, tea's fine. I just take it with a little milk. That's how I like my tea. SUSAN: That's my husband and my stepson, Dylan. That's Meg and that's Petey. That's my grandson? Mm-hmm. He looks just like you did when you were a child. Last year I was able to go back to school for my graduate degree in Art History. You're kidding. In Art History? That's my passion, too, art. Did you do those? Those? yeah. I did. May I? Sure. These are good. How long have you been painting? Oh, just a couple of years on and off. Have you ever shown your work? Oh, no. I... I just find it therapeutic. You have real talent. Thank you. Now I know where I get my love of art from. I have an idea. Whoa! What do you think of that? Well, interesting composition. Huh. You know, I think it's a piece of junk. Me, too. [BOTH LAUGH] EDIE: Oh. [BOTH CONTINUE LAUGHING] I wanted to see the world, to taste it. And then my parents died, and I was totally on my own. Until you came along. Why did you put me up for adoption? Susan, I was so very young. And I was alone. You don't know what it is like to be that alone. No family, no husband, and I was sick. I never fully recovered from your birth. I was in and out of the hospital. What about my father? He never knew you existed. He was young, too. We were gonna get married. And he was one of the first ones called. Your father was a soldier in Vietnam. The very first letter that I sent to him was returned to me unopened. He was killed before it reached him. [SIGHS DEEPLY] It's okay. It isn't him, it's you. I don't think I ever got over losing my little Pearl. That was your name. You don't know what it's like to lose a child. It's all right, Edie. You found me. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] I shouldn't have let you do this. It's too expensive. It was a bargain. [LAUGHS] I love it. And I have something to give you. I do. My grandmother brought this over with her when she immigrated from Europe. I can't take that, Edie. You must. My mother gave it to me, and Grandmother gave it to my mother. Now you're the rightful owner. Thank you, Edie. So... [IN SINGSONG] What shall we do tomorrow? I'm afraid I have to fly back home in the morning. [SINISTER MUSIC] Oh. Maybe you can come visit us. I could do that. Visit you sometime. [COUGHS] Yeah, maybe, uh... Maybe I could do that. Edie, are you all right? I just have a little headache. Why don't you come lie down on the bed, and I'll call you later from the hotel? It's, uh... It's nothing. She's great, Martin. She's charming, she's intelligent. She's even an artist. A good one. She sounds wonderful. I can't wait to meet her. I feel bad about leaving her now. She seemed so sad when I said goodbye. Well, we miss you, but, I guess if you have to stay... No, I miss you, too. And I don't wanna stay away from Petey too long. Martin, how would you feel if I brought her home with me? Just for a week or so. Why not? Thank you, Martin. I love you. Give everyone a big kiss from me. Okay, I will. Bye. Bye, honey. Well, looks like we're going to have some company. Does that mean I have to share my bathroom? Dylan, cut it out. This is so great for Susan. Imagine... meeting your real mother after all these years. [SIRENS WAIL IN DISTANCE] [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? SUSAN: Edie, you sound tired. I didn't wake you, did I? Susan! No, I'm fine. I'm, uh... I'm having a cup of tea. I've been thinking... Why don't you fly home with me for a visit? Yes! Yes. Okay. At 9:00 A.M. I'll pick you up. I realize it's short notice. Never mind short notice. Wild horses couldn't keep me off that plane. I'll, uh, see you in the morning, darling, okay? Okay. Bye Bye bye. [SINISTER MUSIC CONTINUES] [EDIE COOING] EDIE: Petey, you're the sweetest little boy I ever saw. Yes, you are. You want some more milk? Here, I'll give you some. SUSAN: Let me take over. You haven't touched your dinner. Oh, never mind that. You don't know what pleasure this gives me. That was delicious, but... You're such a bundle of joy. Did you know you're a bundle of joy? [KISSING] It's been such a long time since I was part of a family. Well, don't be fooled. You haven't got to know us yet. Tonight we're on our best behavior. So am I. Susan tells me you're a nurse. I was. I'm presently retired. All right, where did you work? I was at St. Julian's. No kidding. Do you know I had an old med school buddy who works at St. Julian's. His name is Howie Kelner. Do you know him? Howie Kelner... Well, it's a big place. Okay, who wants coffee? I'd like a nice hot cup over here, please. Me, too. Mom, you wanna help me in the kitchen? Oh, great. Thank you. Thank you. Can I have a bigger piece? Yes. Verna... Aren't you having any cake? No, I'm diabetic. Do you have to give yourself those awful shots? I hate needles. That's an odd phobia for a nurse. It is, isn't it? Well, I can give my patients shots, but I can't imagine sticking a needle in my own arm. Same with my wife. I give Verna her injections. I don't know what I'd do without him. Mom, you've really outdone yourself. This is really incredible. [PETEY BABBLING] EDIE: This has been the most wonderful day. [GASPS] You know what? The three of us should have lunch together. Just you and me and Dewey. That'd be very nice. Oh, please. May I? I'd like to get better acquainted. After all, we're family now. You and Dewey... You were such good parents to Susan. I can see it. You're so close. It almost makes me jealous. Oh, there now. SUSAN: Thank you. Thank you. I love you. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [GIGGLING] Mm! What's that? I don't know, but it sure smells good. [SUSAN LAUGHS] Good morning. I hope I didn't wake you? What's all this? Breakfast. Oh, Edie, you're our guest. You didn't have to make breakfast. It makes me feel at home. Did I wake up in the wrong house? The only way to start the day... The smell of coffee, a big breakfast, a big hug. [LAUGHS] Come on, guys. Come dig in. I hope you don't mind. I cut some flowers from your garden. I'm surprised you found anything alive out there. [ALL LAUGH] Someone's been neglecting their chores. I'm sorry. I'll do it this weekend. EDIE: Would you mind if I tended the garden? There aren't many gardens where I live. I don't mind. It's all yours. Cheers. Cheers. Hi. You must be Edie. I'm Meg. Hi. Hello, Meg. Pleased to meet you. Did you do all this? Yes. Well, I can see I'm not needed around here anymore. Well, don't get any ideas about leaving. Hi, Susan. Hi. Look who's here, Petey. Aw! Come to Grandma. He's been asking for you all morning. Oh. He misses you so much on your days off. There's my buddy. Do I get a kiss today? Now, why didn't I get one of those? Aw! Thank you. Well, he gets a little shy around strangers sometimes. Don't you? He'll get to know you, Edie. [TELEPHONE RINNGING] [SUSAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE] Hi, it's the Nolans. Leave a message. [BEEP] VERNA: Hi, sweetheart. It's your mother. Just returning your call. Call me back when you get the chance. Love you. [SINISTER MUSIC] Did you write it down? [STUTTERS] Oh, Meg. I didn't know that... I thought you were still at the store. If you erase the message, you should write it down, so Susan knows she called. Don't worry, I'll remember to tell Susan. What happened? Meg, I had this accident. I'd appreciate if you'd clean it up. [BREATHING HEAVILY] This is a very high dosage, very fast acting. I'm sure you've been warned about insulin shots. If you have any adverse reactions, contact your doctor immediately. Of course. Thank you. Will you be needing anything else today? No, this should do it. I must admit, this whole thing has been... Well, a bit awkward. For all of us. We love Susan very much. And you are afraid of losing her. I realize that you have a bond with Susan. And that can never be taken away from you. That bond can never be broken until the day you die. It's a relief to know you understand how you feel. Well, I understand exactly how you feel. A mother's love is a very pure love. And it's very hard to share such a pure love. May I, uh, use your bathroom, please? Excuse me, I'll be right back. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [SINISTER MUSIC CONTINUES] Verna, you are going to have to give me the recipe for this dressing. Oh, he's gonna miss you so much. Oh, he is gonna see a lot of Grandma. Yes, you will. We should get going. Oh, aren't we going out to dinner? Oh, I forgot. It's open house at Dylan's school tonight. Martin and I can't miss it. Oh, you're only gonna be here one more night. Well, I don't mind tagging along. I don't mind tagging along. It's probably better if Susan and I go alone. Dylan's grades are slipping and we need to talk to his teachers. Oh. Uh... Come on, you two can spend one night apart, can't you? We'll plan something special for tomorrow night. Oh, hey, listen. We're gonna have a good time. You guys hurry up so you won't be late. Okay? Yeah. Yeah? You want another one? Do you? Oh, you want a bite? Huh? Yeah? Well, you just sit right here and eat all of 'em, okay? Yeah... You little pig. Or it could be the teachers. Oh, come on. He's skipping classes. I got half a mind to wake him up right now. Oh, we can wait till morning, Martin. You're right. Thank you. You're welcome. [CHUCKLES] I can't believe Mom still hasn't called. I left her two messages this week. Well, maybe she's giving you some time alone with Edie. I could use some time alone with you myself. Mm. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Now? Mm. [BOTH LAUGHING] [MARTIN LAUGHS FAINTLY] [DOOR OPENING] I'm sorry. I didn't know you were home. Well, what's wrong? Um... Nothing. Excuse me. Go back to sleep. [DOOR SHUTS] What's wrong, Edie? I have this terrible headache and I ran out of aspirins. I thought maybe you had some in your cabinet. Okay, I'll get them for you. Pearl, I hate to be such a bother. Oh, no, don't be silly. [DOOR SHUTS] [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALES DEEPLY] [CAR APPROACHING] [ROCK MUSIC BLARING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Friends of yours? Nice kids. Come here, Dylan. Lend a helping hand, please. I've run out of muscle. Get some of those. Your parents know you smoke? I imagine they wouldn't be very happy. Well... They don't have to know, do they? You got a light? [LIGHTER FLICKING] It'll just be our little secret. Here. Go ahead. Your parents aren't home. Cool! [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Shoot! Susan! Hi. Hi. What are you guys up to? Ooh. Dylan's helping me pile the kindling on the logs. Forgot something, sport. You must be working him hard. Dylan, you're sweating. I feel terrible saying it, but there's something about her I don't entirely trust. Edie? What's not to trust? Can't put my finger on it. Just a bad feeling I have. Ah, you're just a little bit jealous. That's natural. [LAUGHS] I suppose you're right. I'm turning into a suspicious, silly old woman. My silly old woman. How about Dewey's Meatloaf Supreme for dinner tonight? Okay. Meatloaf. Meatloaf. Let's see. Green pepper, onions, garlic, and a salad, and... [SCATTING] [GROANING] Dewey... Dewey! [SOMBER MUSIC] Darling, how are you holding up? I'm okay. It's Dad I'm worried about. Sweetheart, I am here for as long as you need me. I have canceled my flight back home. Dewey, why don't you spend the night with us? No, I... I'd... like to be here by myself, thank you. We'll come back in the morning and help you pack. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, I canceled the newspaper, but maybe you could swing by once in a while and pick up my mail, all right? Daddy, don't worry. We'll take care of it. And don't forget to water Verna's flowers. We won't, Dewey. Better hurry or you'll miss your flight. I hope he's gonna be all right. He will. It'll do him good to get away for a while. Too many memories. His sister will take good care of him. I guess you're right. Dad? I made some tea for us. No, really. Thanks, Edie, I've had enough. EDIE: Piece of toast? That's not a decent breakfast. Uh... I'm just not hungry this morning. EDIE: You have a long day ahead of you. You could use a little protein. Hurry up and get your stuff. Wait for me at the car. Can I have my allowance? Boy, do we go through money fast in this house. MEG: Out you come. Yeah! Petey! Petey, you need cleaning up. Come to Grandma. Yes, darling. Yes, yes. [KISSING] Meg, you can start straightening up the kitchen now. Yes. Yes. Is Susan still cramming for her test? Yeah, she's out back with a pile of books, trying to find some quiet. Well, I'm off. Martin, you forgot something. Petey. Now... There. That's better. Now... Thanks, Edie. You're welcome. Say, "Bye bye, Daddy." Bye bye. Bye. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You're leaving. I'd better get going, too. What's wrong? Edie's been here almost six weeks now, right? Yeah. Maybe it's time she went home. I know. But with Mom gone... I kinda like having her around. She makes it easy for you. Just a little while longer. I know she has to go back soon. All right. Whenever you're ready. Bye. Bye. There you go. Yeah. [LULLABY MUSIC PLAYING] Shh... Have a good nap, kiddo. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] Susan home from school? Uh, no. She should be home any minute. Can I help with the cooking? Thanks, but I got it under control. Edie, Susan's trying to cut down on salt. I'm just trying to add a little flavor. Mm. Much better. So... Meg, tell me... Do you really enjoy taking care of other people's children? Yeah. Put some tarragon on that chicken. You should consider going to college. I really haven't thought about it, Edie. Well, not that it's any of my business, but you need an education. You can hardly get a decent job these days without one. Well, I like this job. You really shouldn't work with such a little knife. Excuse me. [BRAKES SCREECHING] [SCREAMING] Petey! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Meg! Meg! What? What's wrong? Why weren't you watching Petey? He was sleeping. Meg, he was downstairs. He was playing in the garage. I put him down for a nap. I don't know how he got out. You didn't latch the crib! I thought I did. You thought? It won't happen again. I'm so sorry, Susan. It's okay, Pearl. He's okay. He's okay. Meg, you have to pay more attention. Petey could have-- Been killed. Yes... Yes... Yes, darling. Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [STOPS MUSIC] Hi. Hi. For you. I thought you might be hungry. You didn't eat very much. Thanks. I know... I know how upset you must be. [SIGHS HEAVILY] It was a close call with Petey. But it could have happened to anybody. Pretty. Of course... If I were you, I'd want to disappear. Enjoy. [DOOR SHUTS] [SOBBING] [DOG BARKING] [EDIE SHOOING] Go away! [DOG CONTINUES BARKING] Go on. Go on. Go! Shoo, shoo, shoo! [BARKING] Shoo! Come on, go away. Go! You miserable beast! Shoo! Shoo! What are you doing? This dog tried to bite me. Oh, sure he did, Edie. You don't believe me? No. And I don't think I left the crib unlatched either. Are you accusing me of purposely endangering my own grandchild's life? Look, I don't know what you're up to, but I won't let you hurt this family. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [EDIE SINGING] * Hush little baby Don't say a word * * Mama's gonna buy you A mockingbird * * If that mockingbird Don't sing * * Mama's gonna buy you A diamond ring * * And if that diamond ring Turns brass * * Mama's gonna buy you A looking glass * * And if that looking glass Gets broke * * Grandma's gonna buy you A billy goat * [BOTH LAUGH] That's so pretty. I used to sing that to you when you were a baby. Susan, do you need anything else? Uh, no thanks. And Meg, you can take tomorrow off. Edie said she'll watch Petey. Oh, that's okay. There's a few things I wanna do around the house. * Grandma's gonna buy you Everything * * Just like she did Her baby Pearl * * 'Cause she is My little girl * [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] EDIE: Meg? Could you come down here for a moment? I need your help with something. Can it wait? I've got something on the stove. This will only take a moment. Edie? Edie? Edie? [SCREAMING] * My pigeon house I open wide * * And set my pigeons free * They fly o'er the hills On every side * * And light on The tallest tree * [SIGHS] * When I come home From my merry, merry flight * * I open the door And I say * Good night. * Coo-a-roo, coo-a-roo Coo-a-roo, coo-a-roo * * Coo-a-roo, coo-a-roo Coo-a-roo * * Coo-a-roo, coo-a-roo * Coo-a-roo, coo-a-roo * Coo-a-roo, coo-a-roo * Coo-a-roo [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] I just can't believe Meg would leave without saying anything. Nor can I. It was most unusual, but I didn't know her very well. Or it looks like neither did we. Well, it's a lot of responsibility, this job, for such a young girl. She was devastated about what happened with Petey. Maybe I was too hard on her. Nonsense. She was negligent. Petey could have been killed. Yeah. We'll have to be a lot more careful about who we bring into the house from now on. In this day and age, we just never know. Look, I'm willing to stay until you find a new girl. [TV PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGING] I'll get it. I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time, Ma'am? Good day, Officer. I just have a couple of questions about a young woman who worked for the Nolans. Meg? Is she okay? Well, that's what we're trying to find out. Would you like a cookie? Fresh from the oven. Thank you. Ah! Oh! I'm afraid they're still hot. Let me. They're delicious, I hope. Her family hasn't heard from her in over two weeks. Well, neither have we. Of course, I didn't expect that we would. She was a little irresponsible. She was not. This job was a lot for a young girl to handle. She just left without any warning, and didn't say goodbye, nothing. Any idea where she might have gone? I don't think so. Mm! Wait. She used to talk about saving money to visit some boyfriend. Mexico, I think she said. She never mentioned Mexico to me. She didn't tell you everything, Dylan. OFFICER: Mm, Mexico. Well, if she contacts you, or if you can think of anything else that might be pertinent, give me a call. Certainly. Would you like another cookie? No, thank you. This is fine. EDIE: You can take one with you. I... Thank you, Ma'am. Good day. Bye. Dylan... Don't you have some homework to do? Edie? [GASPS] Oh! You scared me. I didn't know you were here. I was just putting the laundry away. It's okay. I can put those away. Well... Okay. Thank you. It's unbelievable. Dylan, you're gonna be late for school. Hi, Petey. Hon, did you take money out of my wallet? SUSAN: No. But that reminds me. Could you leave me a little? I'm low on cash. Yeah, so am I. It doesn't make any sense. I just took $200 out of the bank machine yesterday. You probably just forgot and spent it. Honey, I know Edie's a bit tight financially and I was just wondering if... SUSAN: If what? If maybe Edie borrowed some money without asking. Look, I don't mind helping Edie out. I just think it's a little inappropriate for her to assume she can take money out of my wallet. She might hear you. That's okay. She's upstairs. Martin, Edie is not stealing money from you. Fine. Then how do you explain this? Um... I hate to do this. Past couple of days I noticed that somebody's been taking money out of my purse. I was upstairs, putting away laundry in Dylan's room. I found this in his dresser. I know he doesn't have this kind of money. There's over $200 here. And I know it's none of my business, but I thought you should know. Martin, what are we gonna do? I... I really don't wanna get Dylan in trouble. I'm so very fond of him. I'll handle it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. How was school? Dylan, what's the matter? Don't pretend like you don't know. I didn't steal any money and you know it. Dylan, whether you know it or not, I have been protecting you. I cannot keep doing it. Protecting me? By lying? Dad grounded me. I'm screwed thanks to you. Someday you're going to have to learn to take responsibility. Maybe now it's time you learned that. You bitch! Dylan! SUSAN: Edie... I'm so sorry. [DOOR SHUTS] I'm... I'm gonna make us a pot of tea. Susan said you wanted to see me? Yeah. You wanna tell me what's going on, buddy? Nothing. I'm grounded, remember? You know what I'm talking about. Look, what's got into you? Hmm? Your grades are going down, you're stealing money, you're using foul language to your grandmother-- She's not my grandmother. Yeah, well, she's a guest in our house. Aw, look... I don't like the fact that Edie's here any more than you do. But until she leaves, you gotta behave, yeah? Just treat her with a little bit more respect. Yeah? Hmm? All right. Go on, get out of here. Go on. [BALL THUDDING AGAINST WALL] [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] Dylan, could you please stop that? Dylan! I'm talking to you, young man. You need to learn a thing or two about manners. Leave me alone. Don't you like me, Dylan? No. And my dad doesn't either. Is that so? Well, maybe you and your dad would be happier living some place else. Hey! Edie, are you all right? [GASPS] Oh! What happened? I don't know, I... I found her like this. I guess somebody accidentally knocked her off the shelf. Dylan. Don't bother him about this. He's already cross with me. I didn't do anything to her stupid doll. She's lying! It had been in my family for generations. It was priceless. Susan, I didn't touch it! Did it just jump off the mantel, Dylan? Answer me! Why don't you ask Edie? Come on, guys, calm down. We'll replace it. That's not the issue! Would it kill him to learn some respect? [EXHALES] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Edie, I hope I'm not bothering you. Martin, you could never be a bother. Come on in. Come on. Uh, I just wanted to apologize for Dylan's behavior. I don't know what's got into him lately. No apology necessary. Dylan's just at that age. He's got all this energy bundled up inside him. That's all. Don't you remember what puberty was like? I do. [LAUGHS] Yeah. Well, we'll make sure he replaces the doll. Do you think I should cut my hair? I don't know. Well, it's a little long. Especially for a woman my age, don't you think? No, not at all. I think it looks good on you. Really? Thank you. But you're very kind, Martin. It's the kind of man you are. You always know the right thing to say to a woman, don't you? Well, good night, Edie. Good night, Martin. Susan, I think it's time Edie went home. Oh, you've decided? I thought you said whenever I was ready? Look, this family's been through a lot. We need some time alone. I feel as if we're all at odds with one another lately. Even you and Dylan. Is that Edie's fault? You know, it's awfully convenient to blame everything on Edie, but we were having troubles with Dylan before she even arrived. Susan, Edie came for a two week visit. It's been over two months now. Look, I can't send her back to that slum. Fine. I'll set her up in a new apartment. I'll buy her some new furniture. I'll give her money. I do not mind doing that. Okay. Okay, I'll talk to her tomorrow. [SIGHS] What are you doing? Just something to help me sleep. I'm having that nightmare again. Who prescribed sleeping pills for you? They're Edie's. She gave me a couple after the funeral. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Good night. Mr. Teddy Bear, we throw the ball to Mommy, and then to Petey. And then to Petey. Edie... It's been such a blessing having you here. Especially since Mom died. You know, you really helped me through a hard time. Pearl, you and I are here for each other. Martin and I, we wanna help you, too. Oh. We wanna find you a new apartment in a better neighborhood. You want me to leave? [STUTTERING] No... Not right away. Why don't I come visit you in a few weeks, and we could look for a new apartment together? And we could shop for a whole new bunch of furniture. That's... That's our gift to you. You... You need my room for Dewey? No, no. Uh... Martin and I... We just need some time alone. You understand? Yes. I do. Yes. Thank you. Mommy, somebody's hungry. Come on, sweetheart. Okay. Okay, you. Bath before bed. Bye bye, Petey. Susan, have you seen my razor? Edie borrowed it. I was out of blades. Fine. What next? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] You looking for something? Is this yours? Did you get your razor? Edie's still using it. I'm sorry Edie's using your razor. We need to talk. Martin, let's not make a big deal out of this. Susan, this is serious. I think Edie's a little off. What do you mean? I think she needs counseling. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Edie may be a little eccentric. Susan... she is disturbed. What's going on with you? Why are you attacking my mother like this? No, I'm not attacking her. I'm just saying, we should get her some help. What makes you think that my mother needs help? Did you know she was taking lithium? No. And a couple of times Edie's... Well, her behavior's been a little suggestive. Sexually suggestive. Sexually suggestive to you? Yeah, well, at first I thought it was my imagination. But she just did it again. Martin, that is sick! How could you even say it? I'm telling you, Susan, there is something wrong with her. You must have misunderstood. I did mot misunderstand. What are you saying, Martin, that my mother's trying to seduce you? No, I'm saying I do not feel comfortable in my own home anymore. Hell, I think Dylan was telling the truth. What has gotten into you and Dylan lately? I mean, first you accuse Edie of stealing money and now this! Edie's leaving next week, right? I'll take Dylan with me for the weekend. We'll stay at the Bay Club. That'll give you all the time alone with her you need. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Dylan, let's hurry up. [DOG BARKING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Dad, are you sure it's a good idea to leave Susan and Petey alone with her? No, no. Look... Edie might be a little strange, but I don't think she's dangerous. That's because she's always real sweet to you and Susan. She was nice to me, too, at first. But then she changed, like that. She's probably the reason Meg left. I mean, when you think about it, we don't know anything about her. Clayton. That's C-L-A-Y-T-O-N. Thank you. Who are you calling? Doctor who prescribed Edie's pills. What's he gonna tell you? We'll see. Yeah, Dr. Gordon Clayton, please. Dr. Martin Nolan. Dr. Clayton... Yes, I'm calling on a matter concerning one of your patients. An Edie Landon. I've been trying to reach her for several weeks. What's she doing? She flew up to visit her family. She's clearly violating her probation. She knows that. Edie was in jail? She was released from Sutton last year. The psychiatric facility? Mm-hmm. She's continuing her therapy with me as a condition of her probation. Why was she institutionalized? Dr. Nolan... Can you tell me why Edie's under your care? Uh, well, I'm not exactly treating her. She's visiting my wife. I see. In that case, I'm afraid I can't discuss my patient with you. Doctor, my family's safety may be at stake. I'm serious. Dr. Nolan... Suffice to say that Edie has a long history of paranoia and psychosis. Well, why was she released? She served her time. Edie's made substantial progress in therapy. So you're telling me Edie's psychosis is completely under control? No. No. There have been some recent anti-social episodes, and she's still prone to violent behavior. But she's on medication. All right. What exactly did Edie do to be institutionalized in the first place? Look, that was over 25 years ago. Doctor, please! Well, Edie was accused of child endangerment and... attempted murder. Of her own child? Her daughter survived and she was taken away from Edie and put up for adoption. EDIE: Hello? Edie, could I speak to Susan, please? She doesn't wanna talk to you. Please. I said no. Don't you understand English? Give the phone to Susan. I'm sorry. We're just not interested. [DIAL TONE] Some people just will not take "no" for an answer. Salespeople, huh? They can be so persistent. Oh, ho. This guy was desperate. In fact, he was beginning to irritate me. [DIAL TONE] Still busy. Damn. Try the police. EDIE: Why the sad face? Everything's gonna be okay. Pearl, you'll see. You don't understand. Martin and I never fight like this. I shouldn't have let him go. I don't know what I was thinking. Oh, stop. It's not like you forced him out of the house. And he's just gone away for a weekend, that's all. Anyway, it was his decision. He's acting like a baby. It's just so typical. Please, Edie. Don't blame everything on Martin. You know, he's been working really long hours and I've been really hard on him lately. It's just as much my fault. [SIGHS] I should call him. Not yet. You both need more time. [CHUCKLES] Why don't I fix you a drink? I bet you could use one. I know I could. I don't really feel like one. Come on, it'll do you good. You know what? I can make us, from those strawberries, a strawberry daiquiri. [GASPS] Martini! I haven't had a martini in over a year. I love martinis. [HUMMING] [BOTH LAUGHING] Your mother makes good drinks. Now... [VOCALIZING] [SIGHS] Well, what should we toast to? Us. Down the hatch. [LAUGHS] Whoo! Mm! Come here, you. What shall we do tonight? I could fix dinner for us. We could have a fire, play checkers, talk... Or... da-dum! We... [SINISTER MUSIC] We could go out. We could take the ferry, go into town. Have dinner. There's just the two of us now. [LAUGHS GLEEFULLY] [PETEY CRYING OVER BABY MONITOR] Leave him. He'll go back to sleep. I think I better check on him. [PETEY CONTINUES CRYING] [SIGHS] Could you just send an officer to my house? Listen, I can't get through to my wife. She might be in trouble. Well, the woman with her is very dangerous, and my wife doesn't know it. Now you listen to me. I'm calling from the city. It's gonna take me over an hour to get home on the ferry. Why don't you just send someone to check on my wife and child! Please, now! Thank you. Come on. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Pearl? Pearl... It's only natural for a child to cry. Come on back downstairs. He'll be okay. He's upset. Something's bothering him. I cam't just ignore him. Put him back in the bed, Pearl. He'll cry himself to sleep. Edie, stop telling me what to do! I'm only trying to help... and I'm doing everything wrong, aren't I? I'm sorry. Just when you're going through everything that you are. How stupid of me. [SIGHS] Pearl, can you forgive me? It's okay, Edie. I'm... I'm just so tired. I know. Here, let me. Hello, darling. [CRYING] Come to Grandma. I'm gonna give you a nice, warm bath. Yes, whoo! [CRYING] Oh, here we go. Whee! Aw, yes. Aw, that'll quiet him down. And you go lay down, okay? Yes, yes, yes! Yes. And after I give you a warm bath, you're gonna help me make some dinner and that way Mommy can get some rest. Yes, oh, yes! Yes! I could use a nap before dinner. Well, you go on now. I'll take care of everything. Yes, I will. [CRYING] Oh, don't you... Look, hot. Now, be quiet. Be quiet... Yes, Petey. [HUMMING] [DOORBELL RINGING] [GASPS] Let's go see who that is. Let's go see. Officer Andrews. Back again. Evening, Ma'am. I just came by to check to see if everything was okay here. Dr. Nolan's been trying to reach you, but he can't get through. Well, Martin, he's such a worry wart. We've had a little problem with the phone, but they'll send somebody out to fix it. No reason for concern. If Martin calls back, please tell him that we're fine. Uh... you think I could speak to his wife? Well, she's sleeping right now. Do you mind waking her? Officer Andrews, she's very tired. Yes. I, uh... I need to speak to her. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, Officer... Yes, good. Have you had any news about Meg lately? No, I'm afraid not. Let's go in here. Wow! Look at this. [GASPS] Wow! Oh, hey, would you give me just a moment? Sure. I'll be right back. Hey, little man. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [STAB] [GASPS] [PICTURE FRAME CLATTERS] Damn! Maybe he could help us. Hey, guys. Could you take us over to the island, please? [EXHALING RESTLESSLY] Who was that at the door? Pearl, what's wrong? It's time for Petey's bath. He's tired. He... He doesn't really need a bath. Well, uh... Are you going to put him to bed now? I'll just give him a bottle first. I'll get it. That's okay. I'll get it. Okay. Okay. [PETEY CRYING] All right. Come on. Here you go. In you go. In you go. For a car ride. I know. I know. I know. Where are you going, Pearl? Where are you going? Pearl? You can't leave me! [SCREAMING] You can't leave me! [WAILING] Petey. [SCREAMS] No! I got you. I got you. [PETEY CONTINUES CRYING] I got you. Mama's got you, okay? Okay? [GASPS] No! EDIE: Pearl? [PETEY CRYING] Pearl? Pearl? Pearl? [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Pearl! What are you doing? Please! [PETEY CRYING] Pearl! Thanks, sir. Come on. [PETEY WAILING] Okay. Come on. [EXCLAIMING] [SOBBING] Petey! Petey! [PETEY WAILING] No! You don't have to run anymore, Pearl. Edie, please don't do this. I won't hurt you, Pearl. I love you. I don't want you to leave me again. Pearl, because... because I couldn't bear it, see. I couldn't bear it, see. I was so young when they took you from me. But you know, they're still the same way. They wanna keep us apart. They're jealous of us. Martin, Dewey, and Verna. Even this selfish little thing. No! I can't let them take you away from me. I won't permit it, Pearl. I won't permit it. Edie, listen. You don't wanna hurt him. He's part of me. And if you hurt him, you hurt me. And you don't wanna do that. But I can't go back again, Pearl. I can't go back again. I can't go back. I can't go back. Mommy, please don't do this. [SCREAMING] MARTIN: Susan! It's okay. It's okay, Petey. Dylan, you're gonna be-- You're gonna be late for school. Bye, Petey. Muah! I love you. So long, Petey. Come on, come on. You're gonna be late. Let's go. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? WOMAN: Hello, is this Susan Nolan? Yes. Mrs. Nolan, I'm calling from the Allegra Society... What's the Allegra Society? We're a non-profit organization that reunites parents and children separated by adoption. We have an inquiry from a man who has reason to think he's your biological father. Hello? Mrs. Nolan? [PETEY COOING] Mrs. Nolan? Thanks, but... No thanks. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, come here my little Petey. Oh! [LAUGHS]
