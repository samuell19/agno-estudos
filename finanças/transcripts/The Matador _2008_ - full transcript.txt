Each year, more than 18 million people come to witness a centuries-old Spanish ritual. It is a dance of death between a bull and one man... The last few moments before the bullfight are the hardest. Because you don’t know what will happen within an hour. But this is the life I have chosen. SPRING, 2003 GRANADA, SPAIN DAVID'S HOMETOWN Ever since I was a child, the bull has fascinated me. I’ve always wanted to be a bullfighter. On my first day as David’s manager, I realized he knew absolutely nothing. He had no knowledge. But he was motivated, he always had that. He had something. Something. Look at that posture. He was only four or five years old... TRINI FANDILLA, DAVID'S MOTHER He used to drag around my dish towels like they were bullfighting capes. He did it perfectly. All he ever did was play at bullfighting. DAVID, AGE 8 - Dad. - Very good. In Granada, the Fandila name is synonymous with bullfighting. In my generation, three of us wanted to be successful bullfighters... JUAN FANDILLA, SR., DAVID'S FATHER But none of us made it. I’m thrilled that a Fandila is making it big. Because so many have wanted to. Four generations. But couldn’t. And now David unites all of us. For many of us, the thought that we are going to die is intolerable. What makes the matador a hero is that he confronts death for us. There is a real possibility that the hero will die in the ring in front of his people. I feel the energy of the crowd... pushing me forward. I stop thinking. I just react to the bull... and the crowd. Ten thousand people, feeling what I feel. Most people forget that I’m only 21 years old. My life is so different from my friends. My social life practically doesn’t exist. Being a bullfighter has compromised my personal life. I have a girlfriend I hardly ever see. It’s very hard. I get scared. Each time he gets in front of a bull, he’s risking his life... VERÓNICA CANETE, DAVID'S GIRLFRIEND At the beginning, it was harder. But now I’m used to it. I know that it goes along with this relationship. Everyone has a child inside of them. The truth is we seldom get to be that child. Really, I’m just a young guy. This sacrifice had better be worth it. My dream was like everyone else’s. Work, get married and have a family. But I never thought I would have two such talented boys. It’s the truth. His brother’s support has helped David a lot. The protection of his brother. His brother always kept him very protected. In such a dangerous profession, David has to be completely focused... JUAN ALVARO FANDILLA, DAVID'S BROTHER It’s normal that we take care of all the details... so that no trouble touches David. He (David) is less worried because he knows Juan Alvaro is behind him. I say ‘El Fandi and His Shadow.’ Imagine that. I call him ‘El Fandi and His Shadow.’ Juan Alvaro has always been a very responsible person. More responsible for others than for himself. Juan Alvaro left the national ski team for his brother. They were both on the national youth ski team. When David started bullfighting, his father told Juan Alvaro to help him. His role is secondary. Number two. We respect that. It’s hard for a guy in his twenties to deal with that. I was one of those Spanish kids who dreamed of becoming a great matador. There are various ways to achieve greatness, to stand out from the rest. For me, my way to greatness is to fight 100 bullfights in a single season. Performing more than 100 corridas in a season has always been the challenge for great bullfighters. But you need... JOSE ANTONIO DEL MORAL, BULLFIGHT JOURNALIST the character to do it. Second, you need to be extremely resilient. Third, you need to be mentally strong. To maintain your spirit and stay on track, despite disheartening setbacks. It’s not the norm. The norm is to perform 70 or 80... or 50. To get to 100 is very difficult. In this centuries-old tradition only twelve matadors have achieved 100 corridas in a single season. David would be the thirtheenth. I’ve done 20 corridas this season, but today is the most important so far. This is my hometown. I’m performing alongside the master, Enrique Ponce. My performance today will decide a lot. A big corrida like this can lead to many others. The more popular you are, the more people want to buy tickets to see you. This is called the “montera.” They say if you throw it and it lands rights side up, you’ll be lucky. Upside down – not so much. Lots of times I throw it, and it lands wrong... but it doesn’t really matter. If you flip it over, the people are happy. This is a very important day. David is performing with the ultimate star, Enrique Ponce. Although there’s a great friendship between the two, there’s also great competition. Fandi has great respect for Ponce, and a desire to emulate him. Ponce is an example for all bullfighters, including Fandi. How are we? Good luck. Every bull has a different expression. See that one? He has a noble, good-guy face. That matters. Bulls are all completely different from one another. You never learn a lesson from one bull that applies to all bulls. Never. The bull has to inspire you in some way. You have to like the bull. We say it’s like meeting a woman. You really only know what she’s like after you talk to her. Good luck. I used to think the hard part of this job would be with the bull. But sometimes it’s hard being on the street in public. I feel more at home in the ring in front of the bull. I used to like bullfighting, but lost interest for a long time... JOSE LUIS, AFICIONADO Then when I saw David, I became a fan again. ALLEN CLARKE, AFICIONADO He’s made me feel forty years younger. It’s great to see a young guy so committed. Polishing himself. Achieving his dreams. The moment he puts up his altar, he’s alone with Juan Alvaro. At that moment, he doesn’t want anyone else there. I can’t disappoint the crowd with an uninspired performance. And I only have a few minutes to bring them to ecstasy. FANDI FAN CLUB. WE'RE WITH YOU DAVID. In each corrida, there are three matadors. Each of us faces two bulls. Each performance with the bull has three parts. In the first part, I use the yellow cape to test him. And strategize for the fight. Then the spearman pokes him to wear him down. In the second part, I place the “banderillas” with all the mastery I can, and provoke the bull. The last part of the corrida is the most dangerous. I use the red cape to bring the bull close to me. And I make him dance with me. Enrique Ponce, the master, is like a lesson book. He makes everything look so easy. Even when it’s very difficult. For ten years in a row, he fought more than 100 corridas each year. Fandi’s problem is that his bullfighting isn’t exactly artistic. I’m not the most artistic, or what you would call “classical.” But every time I enter the plaza, my primary goal is that... that the people leave satisfied. El Fandi has never been satisfied with the traditional way of doing things. When he grabs the banderillas, sometimes I don’t know what he’ll do next. He always dared to do things his own way. The “moment of truth” is when you put the sword in the bull. A clean kill can seal a good bullfight. A bad one can ruin it. The public shows enthusiasm by waving white handkerchiefs. This is a request for the president to award the ears, which are the symbol of triumph. Today was great. I did my best work. And in front of the master. Good afternoon, and welcome to the discussion of today’s corrida. We are here with Jesulin de Ubrique and David Fandila, “El Fandi.” We’re doing well. But there are always things we can do better. God willing, we will improve even more. We are doing well, but there are still things we can improve upon. CHRIS BURKHAM, JOURNALIST When people know very little about it... they see only the setting, the costumes, it does look old-fashioned. But it has a special charm. Fortunately, we live in a free country and everyone is entitled to their opinions. I think there are much more primitive things out there. There are many things I didn’t initially like which I learned to appreciate by understanding them. Many things about the corrida, the music, the beauty, the symbolism make you disposed to like it. LLUIS AGUSTI, EDITOR But that doesn’t stop it being a brutality, when you actually see it up close with the animal in front of you. There’s a part of it that’s not magical, nor poetic, nor beautiful. You must approach this as something... EDUARDO LAGO, WRITER truly on the margin of rationality... on the margin of modernity and on the margin of our current values, but which reflects a centuries-long cultural history. Not just in Spain, but in the entire Mediterranean region. There are times when we should abandon traditions. ELVIRA LINDO, WRITER We live in a world that gives excessive importance to traditions. Bullfighting is a savagery and I admit that. But it is a beautiful savagery, with an artistic payoff. When you see a beautiful cape pass, it’s like being at a ballet at Covent Garden. There’s the music, there’s the rhythm, there’s the color, there’s the joy, there’s the composure of the matadors. The world of bullfighting is condemned to die. Bullfighting is growing. We’ve passed the millennium and it continues to grow. The anti-bullfight movement is also growing. It’s normal. Bull’s, yes. Bullfighters, no! Torture is neither art nor culture. At Christmas, turkeys are carved up. Then they are eaten. They’re bred for it. The bulls are bred for the corrida and then the meat is sold. That’s just the way it is. The bull even has a chance to defend itself. If it’s brave, it’s life is spared. Very few animals have a chance to defend their lives that way. When you see a bull that has so bravely defended it’s life and gets a pardon from the corrida... seeing one of those bulls in the countryside... I can’t explain it – this sense of inner calm they seem to have. Being on the road is like being in a different world, moving to another rhythm. We travel all over Spain in the van. The busy season in Spain is from June until September or October. During that time, we have only about ten days off. My brother and I spend a lot of time on the road together. Sometimes I wonder if he regrets having to live this life with me. In this world everybody works for David’s well-being. And David is so good-natured... so we don’t mind the effort. Maybe this has cost my mother more than any of us. She’s had to live this life twice. First with my father. And now with me. I was a small-time bullfighter. When you know it from the bottom, which is the hard part... well, it’s very different to see it from the top. There’s a whole world behind each matador. I have six assistants. My family is also part of my team. Right now, David’s on track to realize his dream. But anything can happen in this profession. So far, we’ve been lucky. You’re always worried, everyone in the ring is in danger. But it’s very different when it’s your own son. Very different. I’m a bullfighter. When I get gored by a bull, it’s easier to understand because that’s normal. But to be laid up for weeks because of a twisted ankle, I can’t stand it. One misstep, and just like that my whole season went to hell. David finished 72 corridas in the 2003 season, 28 short of his goal. More than the injury, it’s everything you’ve lost. All the sacrifice, all the struggle, and to have been so close to success. LIMA, PERU Now, it’s winter in Spain. The off-season. But here, I can perform. Look, here he is... El Fandi! - How are you? - How good to meet you. All set for Sunday’s corrida? Excellent. Get his autograph. This opportunity doesn’t come up every day. Okay, but I don’t have anything for him to sign. Here, use this. Look at you. I’m going to be the envy of everybody now. How lucky I am. What’s your last day here? I’m here on the ninth, and then coming back again in December. How much for this? Twenty-five. Come on How much are the dolls? The big ones? There are two types. Twenty-eight and fifty. Okay, I’ve got everything now. My granddaughter loves this. Put it on. Don’t you have a camera? The hat looks good on you! Much better. Juan Alvaro, let’s go, that was enough. Don’t shoot in here, it’s an embarrassment. Don’t shoot in here, it’s an embarrassment. You have to get the unique best out of each bullfighter. Without changing who they are. That would be a big mistake. That’s a manager’s job. You have to be father, mother, brother... a bit of everything. You have to hold them in your hand as you would a live bird. If you squeeze too hard, you will kill him. If you loosen your hand too much, he will fly away. You’ve got to handle them with this gentleness. And at the same time, firmly... but gently. “...547 kilos. Name, “Barbero.” Breeder, Roberto Puga, Peru...” “...sixth bull, number 89, brown and black...” Santiago is a master. He was a matador himself. He trained me and made me what I am. Sometimes with a heavy hand, but always with wisdom. Santiago put my son on the right track. He’s done it with great warmth. And without a lot of self-interest. Others would have put their interests first. But Santiago cares more about the person than his own self-interest. This afternoon’s corrida will have enormous, heavy bulls. Normally, bulls in Peru weigh about 500 kilos, but these weigh 580, 618, 647... There’s a lot of anticipation, because this is a corrida with unusually large bulls. The bullfighters were a little nervous when they learned how big the bulls are. Bullfighting is not just the great spectacle one usually sees. It’s not always the luminous, luxurious life. There’s also the world of those who never amounted to much. But who have so much passion... even if they only get to perform 2 or 3 times a year. They keep at it. PLAZA DE ACHO Some days, you just get bad bulls. The worst ones are the quiet ones. They’re erratic and difficult to manage. If others say you’re the best, you’ve got to prove it. You’ve got to prove it every day, rain or shine... with good bulls or bad bulls. In the end, you do what you have to, no matter what it takes. This is what we call “The Bullfighter’s Pride.” El Fandi didn’t like his first bull at all. So he decided to kill it right away, quickly. Because when bullfighters know they cannot triumph with a bull... It would be ridiculous to risk their lives. But he liked his other bull better. That’s the one he bet on. The best bulls are the brave ones. The ones that charge with fury. You can do beautiful things with them. BULL-BREEDING RANCH CADIZ, SPAIN SPRING, 2004 When you’re ready David. Every year you start at zero. But this year I feel even further behind, because of last year’s bad luck. There it goes! Good. Go ahead! She has a lot of virtues The cow has nobility. But no strength. All she lacked from the beginning was strength. But he managed to bring it out of her in the end. One more time! Matadors only have 6 or 7 really good years. At 22 years old, these are mine. Right now, we’re trying to achieve a graceful moderation. This is very difficult bullfighting. Especially with a bullfighter like this... who moves so fast. He’s got to convince himself to slow down, and give it more time. Santiago’s a warrior. It’s exhausting me. I don’t understand him. Things are going well. It’s time to press ahead... not to be cautious. Torture is neither art nor culture. In Spain, there are people who protest the corrida. And they make sure I know it. Torture is neither art nor culture. This is my life. My profession. I can’t be distracted. For a bullfighter, such distraction could be devastating. There are times when I would have thrown in the towel. But others have given so much, to get me where they thought I could go. I set it up, one, two, three... For those who see in me the impossible dreams, I sacrifice more than I would. Maybe, more than I should. I’ve calculated that we’ll do 110 corridas, Jose Maria. What I can’t do is go day-by-day. So if I value it at 2 million, what would that cost me? Thank you. Thank you, Jose Maria. Good afternoon. We’re here to talk about bulls with our guest of honor, El Fandi... and his mother! Is it hard to watch your son in a bullfight? Yes, it’s very hard. But then feeling the excitement of the crowd... you can’t help it... you get goose bumps. We’re going to take a break from our guests of honor. A local bullfighter was seriously, frighteningly gored. Here we are going to treat the goring he suffered in his eye. It’s in better shape than I imagined. The horn penetrated here, in the eye cavity. We’re very lucky it didn’t affect the ocular globe. All horn injuries to the head are very serious. But in the end, he was very lucky. That’s why we say: “There’s a god in heaven that protects bullfighers.” Thank you Maria Dolores for this great interview with the doctor. I think that... you can never be sure... – in bullfighting or anywhere else – that you have the security of being in control. The risk is always there. That’s what makes this profession so great. It was raining like hell. Both Enrique Ponce and El Fandi made a super-human effort to finish. It could have been cancelled. Enriqe did very well with both of his bulls. El Fandi didn’t start out so well. But at the storm’s height, he gave a spectacular, brave performance with his last bull. But it was compromised by a faulty ending. Then there was a magnificent, noble gesture made by Ponce. He refused to go out on shoulders. And instead went out on foot, side by side with Fandi. We were all moved to tears. Fandi didn’t triumph that day. But was saluted by the greatest matador in the world for his efforts. It was beautiful. Beautiful. You looked great out there. I was standing next to Ponce’s father and I said to him, “You must be very proud.” If the sword had gone in, you would have cut two ears. I didn’t like the way it went. You liked the others better? The damn bull caught me a thousand times. But it’s over. You did fine. Oh, how cute! How are you? Very good. Hello. How are you? Both sides. Here’s both. Dammit, I’m sore. I really admire the courage you have. Let me tell you – I love the way you place the banderillas. Especially the “violin move.” That kills me. Actually, I’m not so crazy about that. Sure, it’s different. Different, original. I love it. I prefer more classical moves. But people like that other stuff better. I must tell you. You’ve gotten a lot better since last year. I imagine it’s a process, and it’s hard to stay with it. The hard part is to get better every single year. It must be tough. Sooo.. You have to get used to everything. "I'M MOST PROUD OF FEELING LIKE A BULLFITHER." "I HOPE EVERY YEAR GETS BETTER AND BETTER." JAEN OCTOBER 15, 2004 David finished the 2004 season with 97 corridas. 3 short of his goal. I had to do something. At age 24, I was suffocating. I know Santiago was trying to protect me. He put me on the road to success. But now it’s over. Antonio Mantilla is a real promoter, and a businessman. That’s what I need now, more than a trainer. I need help getting into more important corridas, with better bulls. Bigger audiences. Who wouldn’t have chosen this? Come on, let’s solve this problem. Mantilla, what do you say? I’m not the one making the problem. But you have to decide. If we change it, there is no problem. My job is to get contracts for the most and the best corridas possible. ANTONIO MANTILLA, MANAGER After that, when the corrida starts, I can’t do anything else. The rest is up to David. SUMMER, 2005 There are some days you just know will be the most important in your life. Today, they’ve given me the honor and responsibility of killing six bulls. By myself... and in my hometown. Entering the “100 club” is important to me. But how you get there also matters. If there were ever a time to tear my heart out for the public... this is it. I asked the doctor to keep me awake while he operated. I knew I’d need my reflexes. This is the most important day of my career. I’m going back out to the ring no matter what it costs. The wait was 45 minutes. Nobody left the plaza. It seemed impossible that someone so badly injured as to need surgery... would come back out to kill three remaining bulls. The challenge of a lifetime was that afternoon. Forget what would happen in the future... or what happened in the past. To triumph that day, no matter what. Spain without bullfighting is inconceivable. If we’re politically correct, it’s a brutality, period. The bull and its blood symbolize a call to nature at its most brutal, pure and irrational. It’s logical. The bull is raised to be killed. There is something I like about the bullfight, and it’s linked to my childhood. But sometimes we find ourselves defending the indefensible. There are those who say this world is antiquated... our national fiesta. My family, and many others, are proud of what I do. And the effort I put into it. This is my way of assuring my place in the history of this great Spanish tradition. Twelve days after his historic performance, David recovered from his injury and resumed the season. On October 4, 2005 David completed his 100th corrida. He finished the season as Spain’s top-ranked matador.
