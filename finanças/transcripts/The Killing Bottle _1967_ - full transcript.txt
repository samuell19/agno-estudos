I wonder when humans started shooting other humans instead. Exactly. But it is because of demand that there is supply. It is thanks to orders like yours... ...that our business continues to operate. Exactly. Let me see them, then. Here you go. What do you think? Please pick what you want. These weapons have claimed the lives of three heads of state. Most recently, the life of a Central Asian prime minister. Just the usual. Don't tell me it blasts a hole in the chest next. I see. Usual methods don't interest you. How about we go primeval, a blowpipe? Or perhaps a traffic accident? We can also arrange a fake suicide. What a tough order to satisfy. I never kill normally. And I don't intend to kill the small fry. I see. That's right. I have something good for you. This is it. What's this? Poison? No, no, no. As an assassination contracts company, we, ZZZ, recently came up with this new method of assassination. In other words, a new product. When it comes into contact with air, it expands to 3000 times the size. Moreover, it becomes as hard as a rock after three minutes. Sounds interesting. It is reliable? Well, how about witnessing it with your own eyes? I just happen to have a test subject. Test subject? There is someone listening in on our deal. Listening in? Who? An International Secret Police agent. But it's too late even if he hurries. Ah, I've loaded the car with the luggage. I see. Thank you. No problem. Ciao. Ah, that looks like the car. Is he dead? No, just unconscious from sleeping gas. Well, please take a look at the experiment results. The ingredients are a trade secret, so I can't reveal them... ...but the best thing about this method is that it leaves absolutely no trace. But what happens after this? It completely evaporates after one hour. I see. Japan Good work. Stop looking so sulky here. President. That's because we have to meet at a place like this. How much longer are you gonna be renting a room at a prison? Where else? So you're suggesting we place the Far East Bureau of the International Secret Police right in the middle of Ginza? Shimada, whom we sent to Hong Kong... ...was apparently killed by ZZZ. "Requesting contact with an International Secret Police agent"? "I want to hand over the Hong Kong tape and film." Call Shirahama 3262. Room 103. What's this? Shirahama 3262 is a tourist hotel. So you want me to walk right into a trap? It could be a trap or a prank... ...or a contact carrying Shimada's message just before he died. Hurry up. But this isn't the kind of thing you'd put in a newspaper ad. Are you going to keep talking? I'm going. I'm going. I just need to go, right? Should I say I'm from the Secret Police? Come in. Do you need anything? It's about this. Ah, the tape and film? It's in the red suitcase. You're a greenhorn, aren't you? Setting a trap in a suitcase is so old-fashioned. But using a newspaper ad? What if the enemy- But it worked, right? You're the second one. What? Second? You're still here? Miss. There isn't anything else, is there? How about you look yourself? Where is it? Below the bed. You're not bad. Mm-hmm. Not bad, you turkey. What do you think? I'm 3rd dan in judo. Who was that? That was dangerous! Go there. Damn it. If we can hear the gun shot, then we can estimate his position. Yeah, he doesn't have a silencer on. Will you miss? No. I'll light it up for just 3 seconds. With your lighter? Once you see him, it's all yours. Are you confident you got him in one? No. Aim properly this time. Hm? You're good. I knew it's him. You know him? A ZZZ member. So you're John Carter? How do you know? Your one-armed shoulder throw. You're Kitami, right? Huh? Your right hand. Fly everyone to Japan at once. Hayata, what do we lack? It's better to work alone. Alone? If you work alone, this will be all that returns. Don't underestimate our opponents. The International Secret Police is on the move. I'll just do it alone. Even if you want to be a good boy alone... ...there won't be extra bonus. Or do you think we're good-for-nothing nuisances? I don't know how good you are... ...but we're all professionals too. Stop fighting among yourselves. We aren't fighting. It's a competition. Competition? Yes. It's more interesting to compete against one another. Right, Aya? Off to Japan, then. Stop staring around. Let's go too. Mr. John Carter? Are you a real International Secret Police agent? P-President... That's rude. And you too! Why isn't there anything on this Hong Kong tape? I wonder why? You aren't in kindergarten anymore. Is there something wrong with my eyes? You say there's something on this tape? Idiots! You got tricked by that girl... ...and returned just like that? How about saying something?! That woman... was scary. Exactly! Listen. You were dispatched by headquarters to foil the assassination of Buddhabal's prime minister. We were told to work together for that purpose. Not get outwitted by a girl and work with her! Do this job without a woman. Understood? No woman! Got it?! Yes, sir. Hey, come on. Huh? That's the prime minister of Buddhabal. But what a tiny reception. They're traveling incognito. They even told us to go easy. As a result, ZZZ will be able to target him easily too. Who's that behind the prime minister? That's the chief of his security team, General Rubeza. Long time no see, Captain. Hayata... Hayata! We haven't met since we fought on the front line in the Korean War! Captain! But stop calling me Captain. I see. You aren't my boss anymore. Just a comrade in arms. Come. But it was all thanks to you, Captain, that we're here today. No, it was your bravery. Come on. How's your wife? When I returned, my wife had passed away. Is that so? So what are you doing now? I sell industrial chemicals. A salesman? That's good to hear. I wish I could chat more... ...but I have someone to meet. Ah, no problem. I have business to do too. Let's meet again. See you then. I'm John Carter. Ah, I've been told. He's waiting for you in the suite on the 3rd floor. Thank you. The prime minister wishes to revitalize Buddhabal as a modern nation. That will require a drastic reformation. And someone believes that makes him the destroyer of the country. And wants to assassinate him. Quite a common occurrence. But they do not stain their own hands with blood. You already know, don't you? They will contract the assassination to ZZZ. And on foreign lands. That means during his stay in Japan. Yes. Ah, Your Excellency. Your Excellency. This is an agent from the International Secret Police. Ah. Sorry for having you do this boring job. It isn't a boring job. Your Excellency, please refrain from going out alone. Going out alone? As you can see, I'm always led around on a leash. I will get in trouble if something were to happen to you, Your Excellency. I'm doing resistance exercises... ...so I'm prepared for anything. Occasionally I want to grow a pair of wings! You come alone at night~ Is the night the sea? You come along~ Though I've been drained of love, you stare at me~ And hug me tightly with your hands~ But there was a storm brewing here too~ Ah~ I entrust myself to memories~ I'll sing again this evening~ Dark blues~ Any reason why you're alone? No woman. I'm sorry to hear that. Sir. You aren't interested at all? She's imported. I prefer local products. Hey, do you have a newspaper? Newspaper? Don't look at me like that. Today's evening papers. Right away. Here you go. Come in. It's unlocked. There you are. There was nothing on the film I gave you the other day, right? That's why I've been waiting. Who are you?! I would like to have the film. Are you from the International Secret Police? Yeah. You're lying! You aren't the same guy! Where is the film? Let him in. Come in. Drop your gun. Drop it! I don't have one. Really. A International Secret Police agent without a gun? The boss wouldn't let me carry one. He said it's dangerous because I'm bad with guns. "If you show off too much, I'll confiscate it." And that's why you won't live long. In times of need, I'll borrow one from the opponent. And you think your opponent will lend you one? Hey, you. Hey. You fool, it's just a prosthetic. Prosthetic? Oh, come on. Where's the film? Before that, I have a request. A request? Let me become an assistant for the Secret Police. Or else I won't hand over the film. In that case... ...raise one hand and close your eyes. Like this? We don't have time for you to play detective. You tricked me! It looks like there's something hanging from his hand. Yes. This tube is the newly developed murder tool? So it's going to be by poison? But according to the tape, the customer wasn't in favor of poison. Yeah, they did say it was a tough order. I wonder what's this thing hanging from his hand? It appears to be a medal. Well done getting it from that girl. She probably hid it under her clothes. Right on target. I guess. Of course, no woman. Anyway, John, ZZZ sent a really fearsome assassin. I almost got killed. They have many such people. Yeah... What's the matter? We might have been played like a fiddle. Hello. Could you get Buddhabal's General Rubeza on the phone for me? Huh? He's not in? They all went out? Where? What? They changed their plans and went for a drive around Hakone? General. There's a car following us. It's one of our guards. Can't we go a little more easy on this? But anything can happen. I already said I don't care, so why not? Even if I'm killed, I've already prepared a succession plan to hand over Buddhabal to you guys. It's the same no matter who runs it. You first. I'll drive alone. You thought I couldn't drive? I said I do resistance exercises, right? I even drive trucks. So guys, you ready? Alright. He's coming closer. What are those?! Huh? What are those?! I can't hear you! One! Two! Three! Huh? What happened? Huh? What? Kitami! Your Excellency! Are you alright?! Thank you! Are you hurt? Come. Here! Hurry! But... ...how did you take these pictures? Actually, look. Yeah? Well... It looks like an ordinary badge... ...but is actually a camera lens. I control it from my pocket. If you had said it earlier, we could have prepared many better cameras. Well, yeah. By the way... This is a photo Shimada took in Hong Kong. Are they the same person? No. That silhouette just looks like it. There'll always be a chance for them to assassinate the prime miniter. I wonder who hired ZZZ. I can't make out anything with such colors. That means it's time to sleep. There's no point staying up, eh? Yeah, I agree. There's nothing we can do. This isn't such a good job as people make it out to be. Hello? Hello? Stop it! Don't play dirty. I'm amazed you managed to hold your breath so quickly. The fruit of training. But it didn't work in the end. No. You fell so skillfully. It looked so real. You understand it well. Let's be careful next time onward. You think there's a next time? Wait! Come on! Cut it out! In a drunken stupor, you shot your friend to death and then fell to your death from the roof. That's how it's gonna be. That's cheap stuff. Stop talking and stand up there! Here, it's the same gun model. Grip it tightly as you jump. Go any time you want. If you have any last words, say it now. Umm, do you have a parachute? Stop screwing around! Excuse me. What rights do you have?! Oh! If you just can't decide when, then it can't be helped. I'll do a countdown. W-w-wait. Isn't there room for discussion? No. Nuisances are eliminated. That's the ironclad rule of ZZZ. On the count of 5. 4 seconds. 3 seconds. 2 seconds. I know! I know! 1 second! Bang! It's me, idiot! Hey. We can't escape through the window. Window? No thanks! Hey. Let me become an assistant for the Secret Police! It's dangerous! What are you doing?! I'm looking for my records. Records? Come on, we don't need music! Come on, can't I be your assistant? Please. W-what should we do? Umm, you're asking that? If no, then I've got an idea. Did something happen? What's the matter? ZZZ lackeys. Who? ZZZ? Where's the prime minister? A subordinate is watching over him. Your Excellency? Are you asleep? Where's the prime minister?! What happened to him?! Kitami! Huh? Look! Your Excellency! Are you alright? Hey, get a towel! A towel! A t- It's him! Hayata? Be careful. He's not just some run-of-the-mill assassin. I know Hayata. Ha... Hayata? He's Japanese? No, an overseas second-generation one. He was my comrade in arms. Comrade in arms? John. There. He's hiding in there. Wait. Could it be a trap? Trap? Try to get close and you'll be shot in an instant. How do you know? Get down! Hayata! Stop attacking your comrade! Captain! Don't get in my way! That goes to your friend too! Hayata! Why are you after the prime minister?! Business. Hayata! Hayata! Hayata! Stop it. Get down. Let's talk. It's no use. You guys are interfering with my business... ...but it's because it's you guys that it's worth it! I don't wish to shoot him... ...but I have no choice. John. OK. I'm counting on you. Suddenly you can't hit anymore. Sorry. You can't shoot your comrade? I was aiming for his leg. Looks like he fled. Where did you meet him? In Korea. He was my subordinate. Subordinate? He was an excellent subordinate. It's not just the enemy. If the situation calls for it... ...he would even kill himself too. Himself. Himself? One night, we went behind the enemy lines to blow up a bridge. We blew up the bridge successfully... ...but Hayata and I were trapped. Captain! It's no use, Captain. Just run! I can't let you die for my sake. Please just run! Get going already! Then, Captain... ...kill me and go! Idiot! Don't you want to see your wife again?! Hayata. Hang on! Captain! We'll get back home, Captain! Hayata! Hayata, eh? Rather than seeing him as an enemy... ...I feel so thankful that I'm going to cry. Well, yeah. It's like the enemy has one more card to play now. If it was a game, I'd have forfeited. Why don't I be your card? That's cruel. You took me out with you too. I'm your assistant. No one said you're our assistant. At this moment, I swear to be worthy to be an assistant of the International Secret Police... ...and approve of my own membership myself. Come on. You're the kind who gets into people's cars without permission by picking the lock, right? Don't say I picked your lock. That's mean! The door wasn't locked. That's why I got in and locked it. Hey, get out! Now! No! Come on! What? What's wrong?! No! No! No! Listen. We did lock the doors. But you said it was unlocked when you got in. So why was it unlocked? The car must have been booby-trapped. Huh? You guys tricked me, right? H-hey! Where are you going? To get my handbag. H-h-hey! Hey! Liars. Damn it. They came to confirm it. Finding ZZZ's hideout is our priority. Hey, what are you doing? A mic and transmitter. It's good for a radius of 10 km. Oh, they're coming. John! I'm sure she was here. Maybe she came to and left? Then there's no way she would have left one shoe behind. Yes. Welcome. Please. I only just arrived on the evening flight. I'm sure there is a reason you came all the way here. Well, we are a business. I intend to carry out business properly. So why is your business being conducted so poorly? You are saying? Our contract was to assassinate Buddhabal's prime minister using the murder liquid. But you tried to kill him with explosive boats at Hakone. If we're killing him anyway... ...then it's better to do it fast, right? How about saying the truth? You don't want to lose the assassination race. That means you were impatient. Impatient? Stop fighting among yourselves in front of the customer. No, no. Fierce competition among yourselves is fine. I'll even give them a bonus for that enthusiasm. That is very kind of you. But please carry out the job as instructed. The murder liquid. Got it? This is a copy of the prime minister's schedule. There are two days left. Please make sure he is dead before then. Two days left, eh? Yeah. Yeah? Idiot! Then what are you doing here? We're going to pay a visit to ZZZ, right? There he is. Here you go. Good work. No problem. What are these? Receivers for the button-shaped transmitter I planted on their car. A red light will flash when it's nearby. That means it's a plan to locate the enemy's hideout and strike first. So let's split up and search. President. You understood that? Simply put... ...we aren't fooling around. We underestimated you. Oh, my pretty. Welcome! Pardon me. Hey, pretty, please wait! Go on. Sir. Here for today's news? Unfortunately, I don't have time for that today. Oh? Looking for something? This is better than the thing you guys planted. So you lured me here? Well, yeah. And your partner too. Partner? What do you mean? Wasn't she sexy? Too bad, right? Captain! You came after all. So you fell into your own trap? But it's tough to do this to my former captain. Hayata! Come down! Hayata! Hayata! Come down! I want to talk to you! I'll have to decline. I don't have time for a chat. The prime minister will only be staying here for another day. You're a simple man, aren't you? Yes, I'm simple. Winning a war means defeating your opponent. This isn't a battlefield! Thanks to war, I learned how interesting it is to kill. It's like the taste of gambling once you've experienced it. Hayata. What happened to our friendship? Friendship? You sure know how to poke where it hurts. Of course we're still friends. That's why I'm not doing this because I hate you... ...but for work. You bastard! You're ignoring our friendship because of work?! Have you finally got serious? I came up with this murder method. It's made with the raw material of foam rubber mixed with chemicals... ...but when it comes into contact with air, it expands 3000 times and suffocates the victim. This is how we'll kill the prime minister too. Captain. If you want to chase me, then cut off that leg. Back then, it was my arm... ...but there isn't much difference whether it's your arm or leg. Make up your mind quickly or you're going to suffocate. I gave you a last chance. Now you understand we're friends, right? Hayata! Is this really what you want to do? Hey, you! Move it! Move it! You move! Hurry up! How about you move?! Fine. What the heck?! Idiot! Okay. Alright, stop pretending to be asleep. I bet you already came to long ago. Just what is going on? You just returned from the entrance to Hell. You brought me here all by yourself? I can't believe it. Now have you rerecognized my skills as an assistant? You were looking for it, right? If you found it, then tell me. I didn't know you already found it. I was looking all over the place. Oh. That's a fake. It doesn't work? It does. If not, I wouldn't have fallen for their trap. But... ...this is different than the one John planted. Damn it... By the way... ...just who on Earth are you? Although it's a little late to be asking this. Your assistant. Stop screwing around. You're suspecting me, right? Anyone would be suspicious. You were unconscious in the middle of the forest. So how did you disappear? I couldn't stay sleeping forever. When I awoke, no one was around, so I just walked back. Leaving one shoe behind? Ah. It's beeping! Don't dodge the question. It's still beeping even when you removed the battery! John is nearby. Let me go too! No way. You're still under suspicion. Just hurry! That's his car! John! Where are you, John?! Hey... John's foot... Ow!! John! John! I'm amazed that you made it out! You look marvelous! You escaped thanks to your gun, right? Get back! Today's the last day? Yes. Tomorrow onward, Buddhabal will be ours. But mistakes will not be forgiven. "Forgiveness" is not in the vocabulary of my national police force. But of course, we are nothing compared to your army, General. It's good that you understand. We can cooperate, can't we? We've worked hard over the years, haven't we? Here, have one. Thanks. A lighter with a clock? I chanced upon it on the streets and bought it. Oh? You can have it if you want. Oh, thank you then. We'll have to make it grand eventually, but for now... ...let's just have a toast. That's fine with me. For our coup d'état. It really has been long, hasn't it? By the way... ...do you have any last words? Huh? Well, I guess it's too late. The paralysis has already spread to your entire body. I dislike friendships. I like having it all for myself. Hello? This is General Rubeza of Buddhabal. Is John there? Hey. It's you? Well, you see... Actually, General, it's down to one day left. How about we request the Japanese police to go on full alert? Dreamland is huge. He'll easily be a target there. Huh? No? Yes. We don't want to make a big deal out of it. Otherwise, if the newspapers pick it up... ...people will think that Buddhabal is politically unstable. Yes. You guys do it. And the prime minister isn't going to Dreamland. Yes. The schedule has been changed. He will be viewing Momoyama Castle instead. Yes. Momoyama Castle. It will be at 11 AM. Ah, Your Excellency. What time are we going to Dreamland? 11 AM. Ah. Are you sure? Try not to use it. You act too quickly. Are you confident? Nope. But why did they change the schedule? Probably trying to outsmart ZZZ. Really? Outdoor Action Special Show 1920s Western America Bank Gang Stage Show One please, mister. Okay. It just feels like something is wrong. Maybe we're the ones being outsmarted? Watch out! Are you guys here for a picnic? The prime minister isn't coming. What? Then where is he? He already left for Nara Dreamland long ago. Really? You can trust my information. How about seeing it with your own eyes? But how did you know we were here? Did you forget? You left it with me. I'll be off first! John. Alright. Off to Nara Dreamland! Hey, I want one of these at home! Ladies and gentlemen. And now, we bring you the 1920s Western America Bank Gang Show. Your Excellency. Oh, it's you guys. Where's the general? Well, he got lost. Speaking about being lost... ...where did she go? I thought she was with us when we entered. It's here! For this show, we will pick a special participant from the audience to be the hostage. That person will be given a present after that. Please stay and watch until the end of the show. Sit. Put your hands where I can see them! Robbery! Bang! Hurry up! Ow, ow, ow! My foot! When that car leaves, you two will have to die. Then we'll disappear slowly with the ice cream carts. Let's go, shall we? What? Now, who shall it be? Ah, this man, please. Please get on the vehicle. Stop! Stop! Stop! John! Is this the present? What an amazing lady! Come in. What's going on?! Wait, Hayata! Don't run! Hayata! John, you take care of him! Alright! Hey! Hey! Close the gates! Hey! Hey! Hayata! Your Excellency! Oh! Get me out of here. Come. All the exits are closed! Alright, let's smash through that gate! Your Excellency! Thank you so much. Those fools. Just as I thought. Hayata! (Hayata!) (Hayata!) Get down! Kitami! Please! Don't shoot him! He's my friend! Captain! Hayata... I won't let you run anymore. Give up. I'll do anything I can for you. Captain! In that case... ...then set me free. There is one thing left I want to do. Hayata...! Hayata! (Hayata!) (Hayata!) No, no, no... This problem has to do with Buddhabal... Well, why not? Hey, you two. Thank you so much for everything. Your Excellency. Can we ask you a question? Ask anything you like. Go ahead. What was the purpose of your trip here? Of course, for sightseeing. It had a lot of fun. The general and police chief came close to taking my life... ...but I will bury them as national heroes. Wh- Wh- By the way, you two... ...did X2 do her job well? X...? X2? Actually, she's my personal spy. Well then, take care. Mr. John. Mr. Kitami. Goodbye. Umm, well, rather than a goodbye, I want to ask you something. I don't think we will meet again, so I will speak. Actually, Buddhabal isn't as politically stable as it appears to be. The army and police force were trying to usurp power. So that's why you took them both overseas to eliminate them? For the sake of our political stability. Well then, goodbye. Damn it. We were played like a fiddle. Ugh, that cunning old man. Anyway, I'm disappointed that she turned out to be a spy. Yeah. I'd have preferred her to be a cutey looking to be our assistant. Mm-hmm. Public Prosecutor's Office Rather than the cunning old man's spy, this one looks better. I agree. Miss. Where are you going today? Oh! I know! I know! Wait! Hey! Listen up. We don't have time for you to fool around. It's time for work! No woman this time too! How terrible. We're treated like slaves. Thanks. Huh? Hey... Hello, hello. Are you going to meet someone? Can I follow you? I can carry it for you. What beautiful flowers. Do you mind? Hey! The End Special thanks to Kiefer Beelman and all our sustaining funders!
