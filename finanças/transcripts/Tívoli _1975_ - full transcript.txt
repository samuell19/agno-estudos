This film doesn't intend to be a documented reproduction... ...but a recreation of an atmosphere... ...in Mexico's night-life which has disappeared forever. Any resemblance with facts and people from real life... ...is sheer coincidence. - There will be a performance. - Did they remove the seals? - Of course. - That's cool! - Hurry up! - Put it on my account. Third call! - Third call... - C'mon! It's show time! Tívoli Your musical revue Will make you move To the cha cha cha Bolero, mambo and danzon rhythms Tívoli Thanks you for being here All of us will happily sing And dance for you At the Tívoli This is the musical revue We wish to present The choreography is ready You'll see beautiful young ladies Showing their legs And a little more You'll have a great time Music and smiles Is what we want to give you This is a great show, you'll see You'll forget all your sorrows Tívoli Tívoli is the place to go For having a good time All of us are anxious to start We'll deserve a lot of applauses You'll have a great time Tívoli Tívoli is the place to go For having a good time Watch it! Get naked! Turn off the lights! Son of a bitch! He has a flashlight! This was all set up. We warned these intruders more than once. We told them they had to go. - They just wouldn't listen. - No, they wouldn't. The engineer is very patient. But... Why don't you explain these men, Mr. Reginaldo? There's no problem here. This will benefit the whole area. There will be two seven-story buildings here. For the evicted people, right? Well... Not exactly. We have to plan everything. Anyway, over there you'll see an avenue with green areas and fountains. Gladioli too, right? And trees. Streets with colonial streetlights and fountains. Over there, it'll be a supermarket with a parking lot for up to 200 cars. Is it true that you'll also open Reforma Ave to the North? And they will demolish all the buildings in the area... ...including the nearby neighborship, "The Organ" and the Tívoli Theater? Well, that's up to the Mayor. All I can tell you is that he'll let you know his plans very soon. We have to renew that area of the city. It's full of filthy homes, brothels, night clubs teeming... ...rabble. It's time to clean up that area. Please move backwards for the picture. We don't want to fall. A little further. That's it. - Let's go. - Mr. Reginaldo, I'd like... I'll see you at my office. Quintana? - Yes, sir? - Treat them all to breakfast. - Yes, sir. - You join them too. Yes, sir. This way, please. Here they are. Yes, here they are. More than 50 deeds of the plots you chose yourself. Well, the ones we could get. These are the places where the whores are. This is the building around the corner of Peralvillo... ...and there are some in Tlatelolco, anyway, all through that area. A lot of people won't sell. They figured things out and won't sell at any price. They'll sell, don't worry. We're talking about very old buildings, filthy homes, dumps. What do you know? Here we have more than 60 millions. Almost 65. Will you get 30%? I wish! It had to be divided by three or four. That's the way it is. Four parts. I'm only getting 20%. How's the deal on the Insurgentes jardinieres going? Mr. Landín has been on my back. The ones we put last month came down. Better yet, you moron. We'll make them again. And the painting of the posts deal? Faster, Paulo. Dear Virgin of Guadalupe Queen of Latin America Dear Virgin of Guadalupe My heart is all yours Indulge yourself, baby. - What is it? - It's urgent, Mr. Quijano. Come back later. No! It's a matter of life and death. - Go away! - It is urgent! I'm coming, damn it! I won't be long. Oh, Güeyo! You and your bad timing! It's horrible! The bulldozers will come... ...and do what they did with my home. - This all will go... - What the fuck are you talking about? - Read. - Bulldozers? - Tourists robbed in... - Are you coming, Chucho? Yes, I'm coming. I'm coming. Give me just one second. That's not it. Here. Read. DOWNTOWN AREA WILL BE TORN DOWN - Fuck! - It's a tragedy! Don't get dressed, baby! They screwed us up! They screwed us up! Get dressed. - Eva! - Hi, Sansón. - How are you doing? - Just look at me. "El Movidas" wants to take you a picture. Stand right here. Look sexy and hot, OK? That's it. Hey, Güeyo, go back to the entrance. True. She sucks! When is she done? - Is she going today? - She's not that bad. She couldn't be worse! We'll stick to your words. I'll talk a little better about you. Come on, Sansón, I know you. You always do as you please. And I don't care if they tear down the Tívoli. I have a lot of offers. I even got an offer for TV... ...and I'll start touring next week... with Eva. Anyway, what the authorities are doing is still outrageous. - Can I print your exact words? - Why not? - Want a picture? - Sure. - Let's ask "El Movidas". - OK. I'll get dressed. You're a collection woman! - Just give us a chance. - I don't have time right now. - How long will it take? - 2 minutes. I'm from Coahuila, I was born right in Saltillo. I'm like a hawk: I flap my wings... ...but I don't screech. Don't pinch her! Stick to your business, fucking Japanese. - What's your problem? - Come on, don't be nasty! Tiliches! Foreigners! They take away what's ours. I like to earn my daily bread with my own sweat. Let's sweat it out some day, huh? - How about a little dancing? - Cool! It's been 2 minutes already. Turn this way, baby! There's little audience again, Sansón. Last weekend was at its lowest. Want more advertising? Let me see that. "If you are a good Christian with solid morals... ...don't go to the Tívoli Theater where they show naked women... ...and tell disrespectful jokes." Great. Write "show naked women" in capitals... ...like "Tívoli Theater". Print 1,000 or 2,000 fliers... ...and hand them out at the church, after services... ...and rosaries, like last time. Go on, the inspector is gone. I told you Eva wouldn't take nobody... ...who could cast a shadow over her. There's no use, when they want to screw you up, they just do. An injunction is an injunction! And a swindle is a swindle. No shit! I'm an expert at injunctions. You just ask, I'll tell you all about them. When they demolish the theater, we'll shove the injunction up our asses. What about your relative? Hey, I know someone who deals with heavy matters... ...at courts, attorney's general office, everywhere. He's a hell of a lawyer! Even the best fixer could do nothing at this point. I just wanted to help. If it only were a matter of fixers. Where are the caviar buns and the champagne I ordered? What? OK, chicken tacos with beans on the side. No beans for her, they show in her belly. - Cafe au lait for all of us. - Yes, Don Chucho. That means: "Welcome dearest boss and great Quijanoa." Everything will be OK, you'll see. We can always change stages. This act is a winner, believe me. - It's called "The Wise Bunny". - Mr. Funny is here. Come on, give me a break. Just watch. Greet him, bunny. The ladies here are very pretty. Give them a nice applause. Very well. Besides it's not ashamed to work. You have no shame, do you? Don Facundo, why don't we talk next year? Around this time. Goodbye, Facundo. Shit, you messed me up. - Coffee, please. - OK. Separate checks. Couldn't the Union help us? Well, I would have to present the case in the proper way... ...to the executive committee. We'll see what happens and... In cases like this, the Union has to give in. Well, so much as give in, I don't know, but... - ...it's a serious matter. - Tell me about it! Besides, the media must be making all this up. - No, it's for real. - We could move to the... ...Arbeu Theater or to Bellas Artes. Yeah, sure. With what money, Javier? - We could form a cooperative. - Where does this all start? The Mayor. Who can stop it? The Mayor. Right. That's the key. We must show him that demolishing the theater... ...is not good for him in political terms. That's right, in political terms. That's the only side he cares about. We'll tell him that it's not good for him that a group... ...of poor people, a bunch of nobodies like you... ...well, like us, is thrown out to the streets. Is there any other way? - Well... - ...you're screwed. Legally, they'll screw you up. How are you defending yourself? Why don't you ask the Mayor to help you? Yes, why don't you go talk to him? I told you if she didn't talk it wasn't because... ...she's stupid but a genius. That's exactly what I wanted to propose. We should go pay a visit as a group... ...and let him hear us loud and clear. We'll tell him if he doesn't sort this thing out... ...50 families will be homeless. What will these girls do? They could work at The Organ. And old guys like you should go to an hospice. That's the picture. And let us hint him... ...that if the media knows how to do its job properly... ...we could be a pain in the ass, right? - I'll see to it. - Cool! Jaime Luna from the newspaper "Esto" would give us a hand. And lots of other people too. It'll be a riot! Hold it, Tiliches. Hold it, guys. You're talking about harming the government. Of course! Aren't they harming us? Don't they want to tear down the Tívoli? You sound like Palillo. - Let's go see the Mayor. - Yeah! - Let's go! - Let's go! - I'll stay. - Why? He doesn't like me. He put me in jail for that skit I did, remember? Besides, most of the times... ...the theater is closed down it's on my account. But Eva can go with you guys. With her looks, who could refuse anything? What do you think? You are so funny... I need you to sign these, sir. - I'll sign them later. - But... I said I'll sign them later. - Write down your name. - Yes, sir. - And business. - Huh? Business. B-u-s-i-n-e-s-s. - What are you here for? - Right. Well, I'm here about the plot. Don't tell me, write it down. Don't forget the Tívoli case, it's urgent. - What? - The Tívoli Theater case. We favor nobody here. There are people who have been waiting longer than you. So, please... Don Reginaldo, what a surprise! Come on in, boss. - Hi, Monroy. - I saw your picture... ...with The Man. Come on in, boss. One moment. You may go in. - Yes, you. - Oh, I'm sorry. Chapas, Don Güeyo, Harapos. Thanks. Are we going in or what? This is waiting room A. - Huh? - Waiting room A. - That one is waiting room B. - Is it? - Hey, she... - Follow me, please. - Come on, make it fast. - Sure. This way, please. This way, please. - Hey! We had an appointment. - Hey! - Hey, we had an... - Please, go straight ahead. - Hey! - Why do you throw us out? - What are we doing now? - Let's use the other door. They'll throw us out again. - Knock again! - Hey, you! - Let's protest! - Yes, as only a Mexican knows. Let's call a taxi. Taxi! Don't worry, Mr. Reginaldo, I'll take care of everything. Fine. It's Italian fabric, a model from Givenchy. Given... what? Givenchy. It's divine. Don't you think so, Mr. Reginaldo? I just love it. - She's the boss. - Of course. Try it on, ma'am. Excuse me. - Something's missing. - Of course, a fur coat... ...bracelets, necklaces and a watch. NANA & THE DEVIL MA. LUISA LANDIN, 2 ORCHESTRAS THE TIVOLI DEMOLITION ABUSE OF AUTHORITY The editor called me and told me: "You screwed up." "As from today, not a word about the Tívoli." "You'll write society columns." Who'll write about us and defend us? My boss was very clear: "Society columns or your resignation." Now he'll do society columns. Big mouth! Hey, why don't you write for another paper? - It'll be the same everywhere. - They're all drooling. - Not a word about the Tívoli. - God, she's good! To freedom of the press. - Thanks. - Look at that! I think they're trying to cover the Tívoli... ...and the Reforma Ave. matters. - Watch when she takes off... - This is serious... ...and you're watching the devil's tits! Aren't they hot? When do you want her at the theater? - She might not even show up. - Who? Eva. They just took her away and she didn't show up... - ...that night for the show. - She said she'd be here. We have to rehearse for our TV act. - Ha! - What do you mean? Don't you see what's coming? We won't always depend on the fucking theater. I'll give Eva her break. I might take her with me to Acapulco. I'll get her off this tits showing business... ...and give her prestige. - Sure. - You'll see. Well, gotta go. I'm going to a wedding. You're writing about it or holding the brides train? Tiliches, we're friends, give me a hand with Don Chucho. - What happened? - She won't work anymore. - What? - I told you so. The look on that Mr. Reginaldo's face said: "I'll keep her." - Tiliches! - All the way from Hollywood... ...to indulge the distinguished audience at the "Waikiki"... ...your place... ...the fabulous couple... ...Chin and the Golden Goddess. She's not working anymore. - Huh? - She's not working anymore! She wants you to look for another partner... - ...for the TV act business. - That bitch! Who made her? Who taught her how to move? I even gave her the name! Her former name was Loreto García. See? From Loreto García to Eva Candela! What an ungrateful bitch! - Waiter! - This is a good act. No way! Such is love One must be a good sport - Don't you want me to drive? - When your darling goes away... Hey, you, slit eyes! Taxi! This is the way of love... Need company, baby? Could you...? Little china doll... Come on, he knows that Japanese style boxing. I don't care! Don't mind him, he's drunk. Come on! - Stop it! - Leave me alone. - Stop it! - Come on! - Stop it. - Come on, big eyes! Come on! It's good we weren't in the car. In Heaven's name I ask for your hospitality As my beloved wife Can walk no further Come on in, travelers Travelers Make yourselves at home And he goes: "Me, a drunkard?" "I'm no drunkard just because I drink from time to time." So, I go: "Me, gay?" "I'm no gay just because I fuck men from time to time." You devil! We... ...have loved each other... ...ever since we met. - Second call. - Your mom's coming! - May I have a sip? - Sure. Thanks. Always here! Come on, let's go find Silvia and Chui. -I was going to say: -Lend me your eyeliner. "In this cool morning I sing a song for you..." ...when I heard a voice from above: "If you let me have your sister, I'll knock her up." That kept happening the whole act. When I was done, the audience applauded me and I said: "You shouldn't applaud me, but the guy up there." - Let's see how you look. - You're right. You don't have much tits. You'll never make it as an exotic dancer. You need some exercise. Those pills are no good. Wear some padding. Eva told me to go like this. Not like that! You'll go flatter. Watch it, here comes Mrs. Furs. Let's go, Chui. - Were they much trouble? - Not at all. Exercises for her tits. She wants to be an exotic dancer, now is the time. Oh, dear! You took after your father! You know, I was in show business for 15 years... ...until these little angels came along... ...and spoiled the best body in the whole country. Hey, I'll show you some exercises for your breasts. Watch and learn. This one is not only good for your breasts... ...but it helps reduce the double chin. Pay attention. Follow me! One... ...two... - ...cha cha cha. - Oh, come on! - One... two... - Tits, tits, tits. - OK, again. - One... ...two, tits, tits, tits. What's wrong? What did you do to her? Nothing. After all I was pretty hot, wasn't I? Hey, that bracelet you wanted, no can do. - What? - Things are going pretty bad. The worst thing was when Eva left. I told you, didn't I? And now, Tiliches wants out too. Come on, baby, don't be a pain in the butt. Things are fucking bad. What are we gonna do? - Remember, darling? - What? This couch is where it all started. Really? No, I don't remember. Come on, girls, hurry up! Get on stage! Shake it up, girls. What you don't show, you don't sell. Do you want some candy? - Mommy, mommy... - She's right here. - Eat your candy. - Look, I've rehearsed... - ...a new act. - Shit, you scared him! The only mute ventriloquist doll in the world. Hey, why don't you let Lili try out to take Eva's place? - Lili? - Yeah. Keep a full shot in camera 1 and a close-up in camera 2. How are you, people? Good day. Good day, like they said to the widows: "May yours be good and generously shared." What's that? I've only heard that sound in... ...Zacatecas, my home town. I was a little late because my car, a new Dodge... ...well, I mean, I am a dodger. No, no, really... ...my old car... ...my old car fell of a cliff... ...well, it was really a pothole in Bucareli St. By the way, I was reading some news. "Downtown streets will be extended." So there's room for more potholes, I guess. Here's another piece of news. A rich civil servant repented... ...and inherited his fortune to an orphanage. That doesn't sound right. Oh, that's no news, that's the story line... ...of the soap opera following this show. Have you heard about the foreman? He seeks his own benefit but he's supposed to work for-man. Here's another piece of news. "The Mayor promises...", he's very good at that. "He promises he'll put an end to corrupt... ...police officers." I do believe that. He likes putting an end to everything. - For example, the Tívoli. - Fuck! Shut up! While he tears down something he makes something else... ...like a big fortune for the contractor... ...and gives his share to God knows who. Well, in fact we do know who. - Yes? - Zoom in. Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - He's always promising... - He spoke to you himself? - ...he'll put an end to... No, sir, I don't doubt you. No, sir, I'm sorry. It's not the monologue we rehearsed but you know these people. - Talking about the Tívoli... - Yes. ...you people at home should send some letters... Yes, sir, in this moment. It's outrageous that 46 families... ...we'll be thrown out to the streets. I'd appreciate it if you did send a lot of letters... ...in order to help us. They can't tear down our theater. That's it! Extending Reforma Ave is fine... ...but it's not fair that Tívoli is demolished... Hey, who turned off the monitor? For enjoying a delicious and unique flavor... ...only "Dorada". "Dorada". Hey! Why did you turn off the monitor? My act isn't over yet. Who sent to commercials? The real golden beer for successful men... ...and for people with a golden future. What are you smoking in there? Plain cigarettes, mom. Just plain cigarettes. This is no plain cigarette. GREAT TIVOLI FAREWELL SEASON DUE TO DEMOLITION - A cousin of yours? - That's right. Getting in for free is all you filthy rich people want. - Come on! - Come on, yourself! This place is all you could afford? When you're on stage, stick out your ass... ...and your tits too, of course. - What's this? - Hi, there. - Weren't you in Acapulco? - I didn't find a partner on time. You never asked me. - Dream on! - What do you mean? Who do you think is taking Eva's place? And the big paddings? I lost one of them. I couldn't go out there... ...with one boob looking bigger than the other. - She's taking them off anyway. - Maybe the audience... ...will ask her to put them back on. Hey, tell us about your TV show. I saw you. It's for retards. I quit. Theater is my thing. - OK, Lili, it's your turn. - Already? - Break a leg, darling! - Thanks. Good luck! - She finally got her break. - Thank God. - Today she becomes a stripper. - Let's hope she doesn't screw up. Come on! - Show us what you've got! - We want tits and ass! Tits and ass! Tits and ass! Tits and ass! Tits and ass! Tits and ass! - Tits and ass! - Tits and ass! Tits and ass! Tits and ass! Maestro? Play the Mixteca song, will you? - Excuse me? - The Mixteca song. I'm so, so far away From my home town Damn it! I am as homesick as I can be I screwed up! I screwed up! My dad said he'd come with my family and it had to be... ...on my debut as a stripper! Take it easy, darling. I couldn't do it. When I saw them I just couldn't go on. - Knock, knock. - Why don't you knock? Here I go again, knock, knock. - Come back later. - You think you'll be alive? - Hi, Tiliches. It's my turn. - Whose turn is it now? Where did you get those dancing roosters? It's a great act. You'll see. Hold me, partner! Don't move, we'll be fined! Get her! Get her! So you want in again, huh? OK, but... I don't know. I can't pay you what you earned before. - I can't afford it. - Of course. Those fucking roosters must charge a lot. I don't complain. Money has been coming in being the farewell season and all, but... How many shows do they stand? Well, three roosters get electrocuted daily. Don't worry, we use them to make rooster soup. Hey, tell him what you do so the mouse will squeak on time. Well, I hold him like this and I tie a string... ...you know where and... Now you're against cruelty to animals? Son of a...! Quijanito... ...I have a great idea for a humongous farewell show. All the big stars joining forces with their poor fellow artists. - They won't be up to it. - I just have to make some calls. - Trust me. It's for a good cause. - Will you pitch in? One, two, three, four, Five, six Seven, eight... Mambo! One, two, three, four, Five, six Seven, eight... Mambo! You jerk! - What's up? - I have a great plan. - Yeah? - Do I switch to one? - No, stay there. - A humongous show... ...to raise funds for the Tívoli's artists. The performers already signed. Well, they've given their word, they're not charging. I'm talking about big stars. That's why I'm here. To discuss the details with Pérez Prado. - Do you know him? - Know him? I write the lyrics to his music! Maestro! All the big stars will be there... ...and you'll broadcast the show. Of course, when the exotic dancers come out... ...you'll go to commercial break. - How much will this cost? - That's the best part! Not a cent, so all the money that comes in from sponsors... ...will be mine. Well, I mean 70/30. OK, 60/40. 50/50. - No problem. - It's poor people, you know. Here, give them this. That guy got the dough out of Pérez Prado. - What? - He got the dough out of Pérez Prado. Thanks a lot, sir. You're welcome. - Free! - Taxi! - Free! - Taxi! - Watch out for the gorilla. - What? She can only go out with me. I'm her chaperone. That's how Mr. Reginaldo calls me. And the gorilla is here to look after us. Only the chaperone can be near her and that's me. If you want to talk to Eva, do it now while dancing. The gorilla has orders to beat whoever gets near her. I am... The taxi driver Yes, sir, the taxi driver I am... The cabby Yes, sir, the cabby I am... The macalacachimba Yes, sir, the macalacachimba I am... The icuiriqui Yes, sir, the icuiriqui This is a clear case of abuse of civil authority... ...in urban disposal terms, don't say more. Listen, the United Front for the Defense of Dwellers... ...has been winning this kind of cases for 25 years. Everybody respects the Front and its leader, yours truly. Raul! Raul! I'm taking care of your business too. Didn't you hear about the Popular Neighborhood Two? No. The government wanted to tear down their houses... ...to build a park... ...in their place, but I told them: "As sure as... ...my name is Félix Pantoja we'll win this case." And there I went. - What happened? - What do you think? - That's why I... - It's the same with the Tívoli. The Mayor wants to screw you up just for the hell of it. That's why I was sent to you. I wanted to... I know it for a fact. - I wanted to... - Give me a second. - Sure. - Just one second. - It's an injustice... - Hold it. Tell him... - ...I need this case solved today. - Yes, boss. Today, OK? - Get going. - There are 50 families... Take this case, for example. A solved case. It's all a matter of having contacts... ...pulling some strings... ...and being right, of course. I was telling you about the Mayor's bad faith. I was in his office when they showed him the model... ...of the Reforma Ave. extension. We can start working a month from now, Mayor. We commit to finish over a two year period. We agreed on 22 months. What's this building in the corner? The Tívoli Theater, sir. The Tívoli, huh? What did I tell you about it? Well, yes sir, but that's how it turned out in the plans. Turned out, my ass! It's nothing but a seedy joint... ...with strippers and cheap comedians... ...where bums and perverts go to jack off. No way that theater will stay there! Neither those filthy neighborhoods! I want them gone too! Tívoli, my ass! A traffic circle. - That's what I want. - Another one? Yes, another one. What's wrong with traffic circles? Just my kind of case! You'll see, we'll get our way. It'll take me from eight to 10 days. End of story. Nobody will mess with you for as long as the trial takes. 10 to 15 years, the longer the better. No one will mess with you if yours truly defends you. Give us a moment, will you? Tiliches. Give me a card. Give me two. All. - What you've got? - Hi. - How many sixes? - One. You win. How much did you say we needed to start working? Let's make it 3,000 for me to start moving. But it'll all be settled in eight to 10 days. Let's make it 2,000. - 2,500. - Let's do it half way. 1,500. OK, 2,500. - Go on, count. - No need to. Raul? Needless to say... ...you were lucky yours truly took your case in. Enough. Enough. We'll call you. Next. May I begin? Mr. Quijano, everybody is waiting for you. - Listen... - Come on, it's urgent. You and your bad timing, Güeyo! Tell her to wait in my office for signing her contract. This way. Go sit down, child. Take a seat, please. This is how things are. This is where we stand. Your homes and neighborhoods will be torn down. Either we stand together or we get screwed up. Mr. Pantoja here will explain to you our position. Thank you. Thank you. OK, people, how many of you are tenants? And owners? Doña Engracia, isn't that neighborhood in... - ...Libertad St. yours? - I sold it yesterday. Some men came in and told me my taxes would... ...increase five times because of the works. The added value, of course. Yeah, added... Yes, that's it. The same thing happened to me. I had to sell my building to those same men. - What did they look like? - God knows! I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her. Well, the one who did the talking was tall... ...hefty, had dark skin... ...blue eyes, thick eyebrows... ...was smoking a cigar and wore a striped suit. There were two cops with him and a big guy with a gun. Of course! They're buying everything around here. The Front for the Defense of Dwellers is here to defend you all... ...tenants and owners against the abuse of the authorities. - Who's protecting us? - The Front for the... - Yes, I know, but how? - What do you mean "how"? Acting according to the law. We're fucked! The only law for us is Herod's law. We'll force the authorities to give us some guarantees. They're the ones responsible for the tearing down. There are different kinds of authorities. Haven't you heard about the Constitution? The what? Out of there! Fuck off! Tiny people, get out! Gentlemen, I'm begging you to let me do my job. Tits and ass! Tits and ass! We want tits and ass! Gentlemen, screw you! - Don't push me! - I'm not. - Don't push me! - I'm not! - You are! - I never push anybody. Are we making up then? Stop it! I'm not pushing. Let go! Hey! - Let's go. - Let me go change my clothes. You're fine. Are you a man or a woman? More of a man than you, more of a woman than your mother! - Smart ass! - Hey! Close the place down, but don't take the artists with you. You never took them before. It's no big deal, don't worry. Don't bother. Hey, we should go that way! Where are you taking us? Don't worry, everything's fine. Tell me why, Tell me, grandma Tell me why You are an old woman Tell me why You don't like jumping On beds anymore Tell me why You wear glasses - Are you gonna kill us? - Come on! A cousin of mine disappeared just like this. What are you doing with us? Micifus... He's always near the heat Just like you Tell me why This way, please. Come in. This way. This way, please. - That's Don Fidel. - The one in the staircase? And Mr. Pacheco Castro and the man in charge of Public Works. And Dr. Valencia. Hey, that's The Man. - Look at him. - Who? The man in the big chair. - Come on, you're next. - What? Yes, the sketch. The Man has a great sense of humor. Yeah, he laughs every time he closes down our theater. That's not his doing. Ready? - The whole act? - Of course. Go ahead. - Santa Claus does exist, kids. - This poor bastard believes... ...in the promises leaders make, of course he believes in Santa. - What? - Don't mind her. Is it true Santa Claus gives presents to good boys, dad? Of course he does, my boy. And to good girls? He gives them presents too. How about bad girls? He gives them babies. See? I told you we shouldn't play doctor. - What! - Nothing, daddy. Imagine I come down from the chimney. - Santa Claus is here! - Santa Claus! - What's with you? - I do the singing. - What's that burden? - Hold it, old man! What did you bring for us? I bring your presents. Be careful! Oh, my pants... Kids... I want my presents, you fatso! Let's see what he's got here. What's this? This is a nice present for our deputies. An alarm clock! - What about this hat? - This hat... It's a Charro hat, right? For the union leaders. You'd better bring nail-scissors. - Nail-scissors... - What's this? This is a very special gift for the Mayor. Why? Because he's always watering things down. - What do you have for us? - I brought a present... ...from the government to the people. - What is it? - A violin! The world's smallest violin! Who's this book for? This book is a nice present... ...for The Man and his cabinet. "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves." What's wrong with Christmas? I like it. - I'd like some of this. - Sure. - It was great. - Yes. I can't tell that to The Man, don't be naive! There's no way we can do that. - Why not? - I talked to Mr. Dominguez... ...and he suggests that you go see the Mayor. I'll talk to The Man. - Two more cans of caviar. - OK. Give me some bread. How are we getting a taxi at this hour? Start walking. Taxi! Taxi! First the clowns and now the mariachi. We're going to the Tívoli. Hey! Hey, you! I haven't seen "Raccoon" Pantoja in about two weeks. - "Raccoon"? - Yeah, that's what they call him. You didn't know? Guess why. He told me he came here every morning. Nobody answers his phone. No shit! If you find him... ...remind him that he owes me 200 pesos. TIVOLI'S HUMONGOUS FAREWELL SHOW It's stone cold! Don't rub this man's gun, darling. - Do I have to get naked? - Yes, not you, her! Yeah, baby, let him have it! - You're busted, fucking thief! - Shit! I have no escape. Don't be a clown! Give that to me! What's with you? Yeah, baby, let him have it! Stop trying to save your ass with her ass. Don't touch that! Don't touch that! Don't you dare...! Damn it! Who stole the barrel? - Watch it, it's loaded. - Let's see. All quiet on the front, my respected boss. What's up? What's up? Nothing, nothing. For your lunch. Your engine won't start. Son of a... Enough scratching, ladies. Here I am at your service, boss. I mean... any kind of service. Stop joking or I'll make you keep your word. Stay alert, girls. Ass-kisser! - The Man is waiting. - The Man!

We want tits and ass! Tits and ass! I'm happy to see our same old audience. Yes, the same old audience. Gentlemen... ...the Tívoli dies today. It dies because that's the wish of a very powerful man... ...who wants to put an end to it. This is the Tívoli's death sentence. The demolition warrant. That's why... ...we're all together here... ...to say goodbye.

Fellow citizens, we, the artists who worked at the Tívoli... ...the people's artists... ...ask you for your help on our battle for freedom... ...to fight with us shoulder to shoulder, elbow to elbow. We need you. - We are your artists. - We are your artists! - Don't walk out on us. - Don't walk out on us! - Louder. - Louder! - Don't be stupid. - Don't be... Fire! FREEDOM ...the Constitution was written by the people. The people provide us of our daily bread... ...and we pay them back with fun. The government wants to take away our daily bread and... ...the people's fun. Hunger is no laughing matter. ...hunger... We're here to... ...we want to fight back under the protection... ...of our constitutional rights. All of us, Mexican people, have the right... ...to fight for our working place. We have the people's, the real people's support. Hip hip hurray! Hip hip hurray! Hurray for the Tívoli! I told you the battery was broken. They won't defeat us! The people has the right... - What's the matter? - The truck won't start. ...we won't give in no matter what. I'm serious. You can't park here, my friend. Move the truck over there. - People will hear you better. - The battery is broken. Really? Let's see. See. Mister President... ...we're here to present to you... ...the cruelty with which you will tear down... ...what has been up to now not only a working place... ...but a place of entertainment and fun... ...for the average citizen. Mister President... ...don't make the Tívoli case a proof of how the powerful... ...step on, go over and don't care what... ...the average individuals of this country think. Mister President! He doesn't hear us. Let's start pushing. Hey you, give us a hand! Release the emergency brake! I already did. Fuck everything! Let's drink... - ...to drown our sorrows. - First bottle's on me. - What a pretty dress. - You like it? - Yeah. - It's at your disposal. - Who made it? - My sister does high fashion. - I'll have to ask her. - She'll be glad. Who makes your husband's suits? A tailor. I was telling you, he was very angry... Don Quijano comes out and says: "Shame on you! You have to go out there... ...and apologize to the audience." - Of course. - Did you? Yes, we did. The inspector said: "You'll both be fined big time." - Half a fine each. - He persuaded us. So there we go. And what happened? He goes out there and says: "Ladies and gentlemen, please keep quiet." And there was booing and whistling again. They got on his nerves and he went once again: "Fuck you!" That Pantoja guy just vanished. We're screwed just for the fun of an asshole. Do they need another reason? - What about me? - Is this enough ice? Mr. Reginaldo's queen here could help us if she wanted. I want nothing to do with it. I already staked enough... ...by going to the theater and having this party. I might be in trouble for stripping. I just did it because he is out of town. Now I get why you're half dressed. Her man is out of town. - Yeah, sure. - What do you mean by that? - Regi told me so. - "Regi told me so." Chino, start over again, Chapas wants to sing. Me? Says who? Come on! In D. Forgive me My sweet love Forgive me If I have failed you Forgive me My beloved baby My adored angel Please forgive me They tore down my home, I have nothing. How am I getting a job at my age? I know what you mean, the same goes for me. Enough whining! Let's stand up for ourselves, damn it! They're taking away our daily bread... ...and all we do is whine. Are we a bunch of wimps? It takes guts and dough! Dough! Here it is! If you couldn't talk with the Mayor, I will. But first I'm going to have a word with your darling. Lupe... ...you know where he is, don't you? You do. Come on, Moncho, open the door. - No can do. - All we want is... ...to speak with Regis. There's nobody here. That's Mr. Reginaldo's car. Come on. If it wasn't true we have an urgent message for... ...the Mayor, how would we know they're all here? They got here yesterday at about eleven o'clock. Isn't that right? I myself drove Mr. Reginaldo here. Come on, Monchin, open up. - Be quiet. The bimbo stays here. - The hell I will! - You come with me. - Let go! You guys wait here. Come on, take it easy. Reginaldo will pay for this. More? - What about him? - He is coming too. Wait here. I'll tell Mr. Reginaldo you're here. Some guys are here to see you. So this is your hideaway, fucking "Raccoon"! - What is this? Pablo! - Let go! Mr. Reginaldo is calling for us. Fuck him! - He's yelling for us. - OK, let's go. Easy, easy!
