Hey, Evert. Welcome. Hey, Beau. Come here, boy. What have I missed you. Welcome, sweetheart. -Hey guys. Hello. - Good to have you here. Hey, girl. Would you like to go in, honey? Come on. I want to thank my friends for the support and support for Babette. And for the boys. And in particular Simon, who is always there for you. Whether you like it or not. And I want to thank you very much for all coming to see me. Karen? They want to drive like this. Sophie, sit down already. Do we have everything? Sophie. Michel? Michel. Sorry I didn't wake you up. You were sleeping so well. Is it getting late? Depends on how the presentation goes. Are you going to eat with them? - They're Italians, honey. I'll see you tonight. Sophie? Are you dressed yet? Sophie? I have. I called you. -But I didn't hear that. Come on, you have to go to school. -No. Well, with that move and all that. Yes, I need a few more days. I'll have it finished next week. Okay, go. Sorry, I didn't see you. -I do you. Welcome. I'll run into you. Hey, I have. This is Martin, from my class. Can he come and play with me this afternoon? Yes of course. -Is it possible? It would suit me very well. Of course. -I am Hanneke, by the way. What time do you think ... - 5.15 pm. Make it 5.30 pm. Goodbye, sweetheart. Do you know where I live? -Yes I know. See you later. See, that's an octobus. -What is an 'octobus'? A kind of squid. Hello. -Hey, Martin. Did he behave a bit? -I hardly heard them. Would you like something to drink? -Gladly. What a good idea, say, that fireplace over there. Good space here too. Nice light. There is a lot to do. Thank you. How delicious this is. Do you work too? -Yes, I'm translating. Freelance. A fellow combatant. Have you ever looked around here? Most women don't work. They are married. With a man. Well, that's kind of work too, of course. What is yours doing? -Michel is in IT. He has his own company. It looks like that is going well with that company. Or not? It's quiet here, isn't it? Do you like it? -Yes. Yes really. We moved here two years ago . The first year that silence drove me crazy. I thought it was me. You know what? I'm going to introduce you to a few people. -Okay. We have a food club. Once in a while we get together and then we cook. It would be great if you were there too. I now know they cannot be trusted. They have offered it to NL Softwerk behind my back . A food club, you said, right? Honey, it's not a job interview. Of course it is. Hanneke, where are the asparagus? - Did they really live in the center? I mean she fits in the group. -She is very sweet. How old is she then? - A little naive, okay. Just a little ... She just got here. -She has life experience, right? How old is she then? -She doesn't know it all yet. We must be nice to her. Not that prissy stuff. Hey, come in. Everyone's already there. Come on. Good to have you here. Yes, microdermabrasie. Look. Welcome to the dining club. This is Patricia. -Hello. And this here is Babette. And that's Angela. And these are your figs. Thank you for that. I know that. I didn't mean wrong. -These are really divine too. Are you used to it a bit? -Wait a second. Oops. Please. Who still has to get used to here? Everyone wants to live here. The green, the space. -And the city is only half an hour away. I'm glad I still have my work. I think being different is also very useful for the children . Of course. It sure is. -Don't get screwed up. They are just jealous. -Jealous? Then what? On our independence. -Who depends on whom? Evert ca n't even tie his shoelaces without me. There are a lot of other ways to get your way too. Which ways exactly? I want to know that. Be happy to have children. -Good wine. Does she look like you? -She looks like both of us. Yes, but she is also very much like Michel. Yeah, but you got it on too ... - You know what I think is such a good guy? I have that all the time. Not that I drink that much booze. You don't have to do the dishes. I'll outsource that tomorrow. I really have a great cleaning lady. -Oh, I mind. Sorry, Karen. It's not like that. Do you want a ride? -Gladly. What do you think of our club? -I thought it was super fun. She had really made it work. -We've all worked very hard. But it was worth it. It's a pity that Hanneke had to be so direct again. How so? That she should let us know if necessary that she has a great Polish worker. That is typical Hanneke. She probably doesn't mean it like that. -Oh no? Are you sleeping yet? Are you sleeping yet? Oh, you were already asleep. How nice. I was with Angela and Kees and they want to revive their relationship. So now I'm going to redecorate their bedroom . What is that beautiful thing? -Yes, that's nice, isn't it? My whole life has been in that. Look. What do you think Angela will enjoy most? What is that? -I thought it was appropriate. Wait, I have some really nice pictures. Wait a second. Here. This one. That's Ivo, my husband. He looks better with glasses. Who is that? -Babette's husband. He is now temporarily in a clinic. So he won't be there on Saturday night. So they don't have children, so don't bring it up. It is quite sensitive. Hey, hello there. How wonderful that you are there. And this is Michel? Hi. What is he doing? You better ask what he doesn't do. He is in the Quote 50. -500. No, honey. In the Quote 50. Hé, speaking of the devil. This is Karen. Didn't I say we would meet again? Do you already know each other? This is Michel. -Michel, good to meet you. What a fantastic house you have. -I just need him for a second. Come on, sweetie. Goodbye, Dad. Hello Mama. -Day, honey. She just sat. He has not made a dance move. I also had to laugh like that again. You were drunk too, I think. No you. It is quiet. I finally feel free. And you, Karen? Are you already a bit used to our group of friends? What good friends we all have , huh? Do not you think? -Yes, very nice. Did I tell you it's actually one big conspiracy? You should know that, Karen. You know that, don't you, Hanneke? You know that, right? -Yes I know. But I am glad you warned us. Hey, we have to go now. But I'll be back very soon, okay? Tomorrow? We've been such bad friends to him. We are all just afraid of him. Like it's contagious. I have something else for you, by the way. Because you like my fish so much. Now you have one too. I'm so happy with you. Thank you for coming. Welcome. Hey, Beau. Hey, boy. Hey, honey. I want to thank my friends for the support and support for Babette. And for the boys. And in particular Simon, who is always there for you. Whether you like it or not. And I want to thank you very much for all coming to see me. I'd also like to propose a toast. On Babette. Because she behaved so well. On Babette. Evert, is that going well with your medication? Do not worry. I don't drink on my liver. What are you paying attention to, anyway? You don't look at that, do you? That's because of the drugs. He is not fat at all. - I'm not saying that either? Karen, are you coming? -Don't be so burned. Hanneke. Karen, the bottom line is that I want this folder in all official EU languages. A local presence everywhere. Beauty Case International. Angela, give her that insert about that medical advice later . Yes, Kees. I'll take that in a moment. Have you ever done such a sex workshop? Just anonymous sex. That's why a hotel room is horny. I really wouldn't want anyone else. He has such soft hands. It's always a bit the same with Michel . Because this is the umpteenth dinner club night ... - Which we're never allowed to attend. That remains a sensitive point indeed. ... we have also set up a food club. Come on. Come on. Because we are not the silliest, you can come along. Our next night is in ... Portugal. Estoril Source. Our own Portuguese holiday and fuck paradise. Do you see that house there? That will be ours. This one. We will soon enjoy it immensely. We are going to party and earn a lot of money ... and when the eventual decline presents itself ... we retreat to our own hill in Fonte Estoril. Hey. Yes, you, yes. As long as you don't do stupid things, everything will be fine. Give me a kiss. Do you still like me? Or am I not that attractive anymore? Am I not so attractive anymore? Do you still like me? Take it easy. Sit down. -Your wig. And stay put. -I'm not doing anything, am I? Come on. -Screw you. I want something to drink. You get nothing at all. To sit. -There's nothing at all. Come on. Sit down. -Evert, come on. Asshole. Your eyes. How's your eye? I can get in myself. -Just sit down. Just give him a shove. Evert was never so good at separating business and private life. Sit still. Nice to mean, guys, but for me the shine is already gone. I say: Sell that Portuguese misery. Simon, are you coming? -Well, vodka. How about it? One for the road. -Not for me. I'm going home. You know, otherwise you go too. -Yes, good idea. Hi, Karen. You don't see it, poser. I'll call you, won't I? Italy, Germany, Denmark ... An interactive site for all of Europe. Fantastic. -After zdoróvje. An interactive site, for all of Europe. - You said that, yes. Exactly. Money can't be a problem. -Say that again. Money can't be the problem. It's okay. Simon, you're a bombshell. Something else? How's your eye? I can still see you. You can no longer drive. Shall I call a taxi for you? Do you want me gone? I'm already looking forward to returning. Hello? Don't touch my child. Are you okay, honey? -Are you OK? Where's Beau, where's Evert? -Where are they? Karen. Simon. Evert and Beau are still inside. No. -Simon. Stay here. Laat me them. I can't find Evert. We now have to tell the kids. The police have also been to school. I can't imagine him ... He was such a nice, involved father. I also know there have been problems lately. What do you mean "he"? -They think he lit it. What? Excuse me. What are you actually getting involved in? Everyone is a little upset. Surely Evert could never have done it? -He stopped taking his Zyprexa for a while. It went well, but there must have been a stop for him. She's doing a little better. They also found an empty canister. Angela has asked Babette if she and the boys want to stay here ... until they have a new home. That will cost me my entire wine stock, but okay. They are very welcome, sure. Plenty of space. Impressive. Here just ... The last. -Good. She's fine, isn't she? - That's because she's well cared for. The blow is yet to come, I think. Is anything known about how it happened? They found a sleeping aid in Babette's and the children's blood. Which means? -Benze ... Benzodiazepine? This will put a horse in a coma. Are you OK? -I want to smoke. Sorry, but I can't take it anymore. That sanctimonious thing. -What do you mean "hypocritical"? I regret bringing you here. What are you saying? I'm talking about the fucking food club. We are there for each other, right? Especially now. You are so naive sometimes. We couldn't have known that he was still doing so badly? That's bullshit, right? It's all bullshit. We just let him sit. All of us. I'm sure he didn't kill himself. I'm sure. -Why do you think? He was just completely stuck. Just like all of us. Let her go. Finally alone. I have to go see her. -Hanneke will catch up. You don't have to worry about it. Hanneke. This is Hanneke's voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep. Hoi. It is no longer with us. Sorry. Did something happen then? Hey, Sophie. Are you coming to school? -Okay. Babette and mama still have a lot to do. We don't have to help with that. Are you okay? Sorry. -Not at all. Come on in. I'll make it a bit more fun for you later. Sorry it has to go like this. Babette and the boys are staying here for a while. Weren't you with Angela? -The plans have changed. Cozy. Family expansion. Hanneke is still missing, so Ivo comes to get him after dinner. Guys, who's going to bathe with it? -I. Yes, do you laugh? Is Hanneke back yet? Oh, Jesus. Do you want to drink something? They haven't heard anything at school either? -No. And her parents ... Not even. I really do not know anymore. I've been really everywhere. I've called everyone. Nobody knows where she is. I'm sorry I can't be with you right now. How long are you actually going to be gone? -No idea. They remain Italians. Didn't I say I'm looking forward to returning? Hey, good morning. -Good morning. Do you know? I'll take them to school for a while. Are you sure? -You've already done so much for us. Hanneke fell from the balcony. In Amsterdam. The police called this morning. She was supposed to be home this afternoon. Ivo? Are you ready? Mrs. Van der Made? -Yes. Dorien Jager. I want to ask you some questions. Would you like to come along? When was the last time you saw her? At the funeral. That was the last time. I didn't speak to her after that. -She did text you. She wanted to see me, but it never happened again. Did she have enemies? - She fell, right? Could it be that she didn't want to continue? No that is not possible. No of course not. You haven't eaten yet, have you? -No. Have the kids gone to bed yet? -Yes, Babette put them on the bed. I said: Save yourself a little. But... Dear darling, come here. How are you now? Angela has a point there, you know. Hanneke had not been herself for a while. That drinking at that funeral. -And she was smoking a lot again. Those ridiculous accusations at the hotel. In the hotel? Have you been there? -Yes. We wanted to help her. When was that? Well, just ... This morning. - So you've seen her? I don't know if it was that wise. She came up with such ... unreasonable, nasty accusations. It was really awful. What accusations? -That's none of your business. It was about money. I'm just too tired for this. Poor Babette. -Yes, poor Ivo. Yes Nice. Still, I can't imagine that she just fell. Then she jumped. -Jesus, Patries. Why should she? -Because she was miserable. No. No. I would have known that. She always told me everything. Don't, Patries. -What not? Hanneke and Evert had an affair. Babette and Ivo never said anything about it ... because of the children. But of course you already knew that. We are all just really upset. Well, then sleep well? Yes, that's a good idea. Try to get some sleep, yes? -Yes. What are you doing here? - That's a good question. And you? I wanted to see it. Do you know that Hanneke came here more often? Always with the same man. Maybe you can guess who. I've never heard of her about anyone other than Ivo. You all protect each other , don't you? This is my number. And Karen ... think twice about who you are actually betraying with your blind loyalty. Glad you could come. Did you know that Patricia has been in Hanneke 's hotel room? Yes, met Angela. Isn't that a bit strange? -Patries won't hurt a fly. And Angela is only hurting herself. She said that Hanneke said the most terrible things about you. That I would have killed Evert. Evert wanted to be like me. Everyone wants to be like me. Only not everyone blames me. Unfortunately, Evert does. His suicide was his ultimate reproach against me. Is that all we are going to talk about this afternoon ? It's not possible. Not here? -No. And there? Hey, Karen. Have you been there long? -No. How nice that you are here. That woman from the police is back. She keeps asking the same questions. It was an accident. She didn't jump. Why should she? -Well ... I mean ... Of course it is not ... Hanneke would never ask for something like this ... What? Sorry, Ivo, but I know. They told me about Hanneke and Evert. You didn't tell the police that, did you ? No of course not. I would never do that. Watch your words, Karen. That woman is out to destroy us. No worries. I really won't say anything. Where is he now? Get that doctor, please. What is happening? Get the man out of here. -Come on, sir. She suddenly started to shake. Ma'am, please. -Let me go. What happened? - Come along. And? -She's pretty stable. What have you done? -It seemed worse than it is. You were alone with her, weren't you? -What are you talking about? You touched those snakes. -Ivo, this is no use. Of course not. - She touched those snakes. It seemed a lot worse than it is. Quiet. Control yourself. -Hey, Karen. She has nothing to do with it. Good that you cooperated. Thanks. We talk to each other. I don't know what she's talking about. Not really. Dad. -Hey, Sophietje. How is it going? -Good. Hi honey. See what I got for you? -Thank you. Of course I also brought something for you. Those Italians know what good food is. But Babette, this was also rude delicious. Shall I bring the kids upstairs? -Yes. I also go in early myself. Then you still have some time for each other. Hello, honey. I'll come and have a look. I think we have an extra au pair. However? Did you know that Hanneke and Evert had an affair? What? If you think you know two people well, they do something like that. I had a meeting with Simon's bankers this afternoon . He wants to invest in me. In stages, but it involves a lot of money. With this backing I come in everywhere as an equal. But you can't compete with him. Simon waltzes all over you if he has to. Thank you for your ego boost. I just want you to think about it before you can't go back. You can still go back, right? Jesus, what have you done? -I've been thinking about the future. And not just for myself, but for you and Sophie too. If this had not happened to Hanneke, we would now be drinking champagne. What is it? I wondered why you actually started working with Michel. Because I see something in him. You must have ever done that too, right? That is it? Hey? You don't care about me? It may well be that that also played a role. That is not correct, is it? I always choose people around me that I like to have with me. Michel never would have signed if he knew we ... So you think he doesn't know? All the more reason not to say anything. I'll be there as soon as possible. What? -Hanneke is bad. Karen. Open it up, Karen. Everything fine? Have you heard? -What? They let Hanneke go. Simon just called. She passed away ten minutes ago. Hey, come here. Hanneke was murdered. Because she knew more about Evert's death. What? She knew he hadn't killed himself. He wanted to divorce Babette and continue with Hanneke. He had discovered that Simon was using that construction project in Portugal ... to launder money. Hanneke knew about it and wanted to make it public. Karen, stop. What are you doing? I went to her hotel room. She couldn't have fallen. You are what? -Hanneke knew about it. And she wanted to make it public. And now she's dead. Do you hear what you are saying? Ivo just lost his wife, Babette her husband. Please leave them alone. -We have to go to the police. We have to tell them about Fonte Estoril. -No. And throw away everything we have achieved? Think about it. You have no idea what I'm doing, do you? I have more than a million in investments outstanding. If Simon withdraws now, I will be in debt up to my state pension. Make 'we' of it. Yes, I just told her. She knows now too. It contains everything about that construction project in Portugal. Evert writes to Hanneke here that he is being framed. Simon wanted to make him pay for that money laundering. Exactly. This is too vague. I understand what you want, but it is of no use to Hanneke. But isn't it clear they were murdered? Where is that? Hanneke and Evert knew about the black money and wanted to come out with it. Everything is in those emails, right? Mails from a psychiatric patient to his suicidal girlfriend. If you want to help this research further, you need to come up with stronger evidence. What kind of evidence? Documents supporting their allegations. Side letters, suspicious wire transfers, shadow accounting, that sort of thing. Do you have any idea where to find it? Are you okay? -Yes of course. I'm on your side, I'm your girlfriend. Let me help you now. It's Simon, isn't it? I saw you at the shed. Oh, Jesus. You have a really nice guy. You don't have to break it. Simon cannot be trusted. I'm afraid I've learned something really bad . I found Hanneke's chain in Simon's car. And a key card from the Fashion Hotel. -Jesus. You don't think he has anything to do with it, do you? What are those things doing there? I also don't know what is true and what is not. - Maybe someone put them in there. What? It remains strange that Patricia has been in the hotel with Hanneke. And that she wanted to keep it quiet. It is also very strange that you suddenly had to leave Angela. We have to stop this. It scares me. You go ahead. I'll be right there. -Sure? The cremation ... -Yes, I'll go like that. I just have to get something. Are you ready? What did you think those two, three seconds ... between the balcony and the hard asphalt? Dear friends, whatever has happened to her , we are to blame. At the very least, let's admit we didn't give at home. We should have been the safety net, but we were the asphalt. And now we, your friends, are left speechless. Never again your splashing laugh at silly jokes like: Wonderfully Helder Hanneke. We can only hope that you have finally found the peace you were looking for. Ivo, tough, big Tit, we will always be there for you. I suddenly lost you. -I wanted to be alone for a moment. I have to tell you something. Simon and I ... - I shouldn't have signed right away. I don't want to say that. -I should have discussed it with you. I slept with him. You knew it. Did he tell you? Not in so many words. Karen. Sophietje has already left. It was taken by Beau's mother. Stop that hysterical stuff or I'm going to hit you. And later tell me why you broke into our house. Come on. You thought I was going to kill you, didn't you? Come on, sit down. I was happy when Evert died in that fire. I thought it would be okay between me and Hanneke after that. I've just been angry for too long. I should have forgiven her earlier. Then she might still be alive now. Did you know that Patricia and Angela were still in Hanneke's room? Doesn't that seem strange to you? -No, I asked them myself. Yes, to mediate. Babette would go alone at first, but later we decided it would be more sensible ... when Angela and Patricia came along. Was Babette with you too? -Yeah right. She was the one who wanted to bring us back together after Evert's death. Generous, huh? Pretty too. I'm going to take a bath. Thank you. Was that one of the kids? I'm going to take a look anyway. Kees wants me to drop by with the translation for the clinic. So late? Yes. He has so little time during the day. I'll just go upstairs. Did Kees prescribe medication to Evert? -No. How did Babette get here then? Are These Benzodiazepine Pills? -Please don't say anything to Kees. This is why Babette had to go, isn't it? I keep his drug records, okay? Now and then I grab something myself, just against the tensions. So you gave it to her? - I'm not saying that. Did you give this to her before or after the fire? In front of. What's that got to do with it? -Why didn't you say it right away? I didn't want to be involved. - Do you hear what you're saying? You could have prevented anything. Then Kees would have known that I was on his medication. I couldn't have known that she was going to do something to Hanneke too, could I? Not really. Karen. Dorien, you have to come our way now. I have the papers. Babette had them. You have to send people to my house. She is alone with Michel and the children. What are you doing? If you're looking for the very latest version of your translation for Kees, I have it here. You really upset Babette with all those innuendo. Come on. To drive. Welcome to our new headquarters. The world at your feet. Do you see that light there? That building is mine. And that's mine there too. It can all be yours. Then you have to keep participating. We can have anything we want. We can afford anything. What do you want from me? -I offer you a beautiful life. Only your honesty is starting to break us up quite a bit. And who is 'us'? You're not going to screw it up again. You have to choose. You have to choose now. Go ahead. Just drop me. So do it. I'm no longer going to lie. Do it. Do it. -Choose. Do it. Do it. Karen. Think. Luuk? What a sweetheart it is, huh? With the eyes of his father. Don't you think he looks exactly like Simon? You wanted to steal it, bitch. Can't you see he belongs to me? Come here. Come here. Come here. Come, come, come. Now you. Do it. You're crazy. -Now it's your turn. Do it now. Do it now. Do it now. Push her. Then push her. -No. Prove it. Then prove that you love me. And from Luukje. Stop. -Say she didn't mean a fuck to you. Just push. -Please stop it. Do I have to fix it alone again? I've given you so many opportunities, Simon Vogel. But every time you chose for yourself. Never for your real family. There is no one who will love you more than we do. Goodbye, sweetheart. Hello, house. Mom, how far is it? - Just half an hour away. It's only half an hour away, Luuk.
