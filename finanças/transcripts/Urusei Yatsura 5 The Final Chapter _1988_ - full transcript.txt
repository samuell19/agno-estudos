"Yup!" "At last, a girl is born!" " Who are you?" " When you're all grown up, I'll be back for you." "I'll be back to get you! I'll come get you for sure!" Hey! Lt... It was only a dream. Thank goodness. Thank goodness. L... Look, you... Oh, what is it, Mr. Onsen? Go stand in the hall! Go stand in the hall! Oh, poor Lum! You must've had a really bad dream! W... Why, you... There was this really disgusting, pitch-dark creep... ...and he was gonna take me to a dark place! Was I ever scared! It was a really good thing that it was only a dream. Right, Darling? Sign: "Tomobiki-Cho 4-10" Sign: "Tomobiki-Cho 4-10" Gimme your address and phone number? Won't you, please? Sign: "Tomobiki-Cho 4-10" Sign: "Tomobiki-Cho 4-10" What kind of attitude is that?! It's because you're like this that I end up having these scary dreams! What're you talkin' about?! Hold it! Just where do you think you're going?! They're at it again. Don't they ever get tired of it? Hey, you kids! Try not to bother the neighbors too much! "Bother?" Of course not! I'd love to... go on a date with you! What's wrong with your ears?! I swear... The thong broke! And it's a new pair, too! 'Tis a bad omen. Why did you do that to me all of a sudden? That's my line! Haven't I told you enough times not to sneak up on me like that?! But it is indeed a bad omen. I've got a bad feeling... A feeling of something heavy pressing down on me... What could this be...? Huh? Why, you! A black cat and a hearse... Bad omens, indeed. Honestly... Lum, did you fight with that idiot Ataru again? You really oughtta leave him! Lum, it's been a long time! Lum, it's been a long time! Oh, Daddy. What's wrong? Oh, Daddy. What's wrong? Well, you see... Oh, Daddy. What's wrong? It seems your great-grandpa's been found after being missing for 20 years. What do you mean by that? Your great-grandpa was in cold sleep at our place... ...but one day, we moved, and... "Should we wrap this one up too, sir?" " Will you, please?" "Take it down somewhere." "Take it down somewhere." "Yes, sir." And you lost track of where he got stored? There you have it. There you have it. Awfully haphazard of you! He says he wants to see his great-grandchild's face. So hurry home. Gotcha. What kind of person is Great-grandpa? Now, let us begin our divination. O Crystal Ball, the Crystal Ball that seeth through it all... Tell us with your Voice of Truth! The Voice of Truth! Tell us! Tell us! It's telling. It's telling. What? It's pitch-black! It's pitch-black! It's the Darkness. Lum... Lum... This is... ...an indication that she'll be taken into the Darkness. "But this is no normal Darkness." "Do not allow Lum to get near the dark." What did they mean by all that? Lum... near the Dark? "There was this really disgusting, pitch- dark creep... "... and he was gonna take me to a dark place!" Hey, Ataru! Lum went back home. "Home?" So when is she coming back? Maybe she won't be coming back at all. You made Lum mad again today, didn't you? Grandpa, Lum should be here any time now. Hmm, I sure am looking forward to this. I'm blushing. It'll be your first meeting, after all. Yes, for 20 years, I was in cold sleep. I bet he's a strong little boy. Lum is a girl. Lum is a girl. Oh, I see, I see. After all, for 20 years, I was in cold sleep. I see. I see. A girl?! A... A GIRL?! What's the matter, Grandpa?! Grandpa, what's wrong with Lum being a girl? I can't understand you if you keep on crying! Oh, this is terrible! I'm home. Oh, you're back! T! What's all the commotion? Who might you be? Who might you be? I'm Lum. She's the great-grandchild you were so eager to see. Why... she's a girl! Why... she's a girl! Yeah, she's a girl! H... How terrible! What's going on? Grandpa, won't you please explain? Explain what? You were just crying! You were just crying! Who was? Who was? Have you gone senile? Who was? I'll explain the reason. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? That's the pitch- black monster that appeared in my dream! It's been a long time. It's been a long time. Pops, you know him? I don't know any such person. No wonder. It's been 120 years, after all. It's... me! Y... You! Don't fall asleep on me! It was all of 120 years ago... It was all of 120 years ago... So you do remember? It was when I collapsed while I was traveling. "Oh, I'm starving!" "Hello, Mr. Traveler, what's wrong?" "I... I need something to eat!" " Well, I can't give things for free, now can I?" "You got me there." "In that case, we'll play a game." "Here, choose and eat the mushroom that you want." "But one of them is a poisonous mushroom." So I ended up eating the poisonous mushroom. "I... I need an antidote!" "I happen to be searching for a bride." "If you give me your daughter as a bride, I'll give you an antidotal mushroom." "I will! I will! So, hurry!" Your daughter? But Grandpa, you only have sons. Right! So, I said... "I don't have any daughters, sucker!" "I don't have any daughters, sucker!" "You tricked me!" "But a promise is a promise." "Once a girl is born, I'll be sure to get her." " You keep that in mind." "I'll be sure to get her as my bride." And so... the girl that I've been waiting for all these years is you. Now, come with me. Now, come with me. Don't be ridiculous! What good is getting married now that you're a wimpy old man?! My great-grandson happens to be of an appropriate age. So I claim her as the bride for my great-grandson. I already have Darling! That's no concern of mine! Say, what are you all talking about? Won't you let me join the party? How could you make such an irresponsible promise?! Who are you? Who are you? Your great-granddaughter, Lum! Your great-granddaughter, Lum! After all, for 20 years, I was in cold sleep... Your great-granddaughter, Lum! You're badly mistaken if you think this is over. I'll make her my great-grandson's bride for sure! Yo! Good morning! Moroboshi, is Miss Lum absent today? She went back home. She went back home. Why, you! What did you do to Miss Lum?! What's goin' on?! What is that?! Something's coming this way! Those are pigs! Pigs? Those are pigs! Pigs? "Flying Pigs!" "Rupa!" "Rupa!" "Oh! Great-grandpa!" " Welcome back, Great-grandpa!" "Hello, Rupa." "I brought you something." " What a pretty girl!" "Is she to your liking?" " Who is this?" "It's the girl who's going to become your bride, Rupa." " Wow! She's so pretty!" "Of course. She's a girl from the World of Light." "The World of Light...?" Who is this guy? Who is this guy? Dunno. Dunno. But what a handsome man he is! Dunno. Looks like he's waking up. Lum! Hey, you! How dare you address Miss Lum in so familiar a manner! Hey... Quiet down, will ya. Quiet down, will ya. I'm Lum's fiancé. What's wrong with my addressing her in a familiar manner? Come, Lum. Let's go to my planet and hold our wedding. Listen, you! Lum's fiancé? What's going on? Is that for real? What's everybody doing here? Oh, Darling! I'm back, Darling. Lum! Lum, what's the meaning of this? What do you mean, " what's the meaning of this?" He says that he's your fiancé. I've wanted to see you for so long, Lum. I've wanted to see you for so long, Lum. What's going on here? Her shocks have no effect on him? It's even nicer that she's got a strong personality! What're you doing to me?! He was just toughing it out that first time! I never heard that you had a fiancé. It's a newsflash for me, too! What do you think you're doing? What do you think you're doing? Just a small gift for you. So that you'll become an adult quicker. An adult? I'm looking forward to that moment. Where do those pigs think they're going? Beats me. I wonder what he's planning? Good-bye. Hey. Watch your head. Damn, what did that dude come here for anyway? It's a bad omen. I can't take it off. I can't take it off. Why don't you just try breaking that thing?! Well, not even her zaps affect it. Did you succeed in giving the ring to her? Yes, Great-grandpa. When an Oni becomes an adult, the horns fall off, and new ones grow in. Is it true that they lose their powers when they lose their horns? Yes, it is. Inside that ring is the Hi-Refrain Mushroom that accelerates growth. How long are you gonna wear that ring like you're treasuring it?! I can't help it if it doesn't come off! I can't help it if it doesn't come off! Yeah, sure... Yeah, sure... I did everything I could, but it won't come off. Yeah, sure... I bet you're actually glad, aren't you. What're you saying? Ha! You flirt! Why don't you admit that it burns you up? W... Who's burned up, you idiot?! You're just smoking with jealously, aren't you? Darling, you idiot! I'm so peeved! Ow! How did you know that it was me? An invisible red string is said to link lovers. We must be linked together by a red string. An invisible red string is said to link lovers. An invisible red string is said to link lovers. Who're you? You can't use force against Lum and get away with it! My name is Rupa. Lum's fiancé. "Fiancé?!" Lum, since when did you... What're you talking about? Thanks to you, I'm in a big mess! "You?" Call me "Rupa." Let go of me! What's wrong? Can't you electrocute him? Nighty night, baby. That fool... Go marry him, or do whatever you want! Horns... I'm taking her with me! Lum! Lum! L... Lum! Howdy! Express mail for you! ! Videomail? As promised, Lum is ours now. W... Whatcha say? The wedding arrangements are also underway. Why, you! You kidnapped her, didn't you! ! Lum! Lum! Oh, poor Lum! Lum! Oh, poor Lum! !! Lum's horns are missing! Lum, Her Highness, has been kidnapped! Lum, Her Highness, has been kidnapped! We'll go kick their asses! The perpetrator is a damn wart! Find and crush him! Huh? Wh... What the hell is that?! Wh... What the hell is that?! What is it? What is it? What? What? What is it? "Mokuroku:" Index of engagements gifts. Accept our betrothal gift! Wh... What's that sound? What is this?! Are Moroboshi and Lum absent today? Both absent together? What could it mean? Very well then, today... Moroboshi... listen, you... These are lists of all the babes in all the high schools in Tokyo. Including addresses, phone numbers, and high-quality pictures for each. What's the meaning of this? What's the meaning of this? I don't wanna end up owing you anything. So let's barter. Barter? This for? Barter? This for? One space shuttle. Unfortunately, I don't have a private shuttle... ...but how about a Leopard tank? Won't do. It has to be something that can fly me to another planet! What?! What do you mean by "to another planet?" Did something happen to Miss Lum? Did something happen to Miss Lum? Lum's not here? Benten! Oyuki! We can't establish communications with Lum's planet. It seems that the airport has been shut down as well. What?! I was hoping Lum would know something. I was hoping Lum would know something. Y... You guys! This is class! It seems that something has happened to Lum, too. Well, actually... What?! Lum's been kidnapped by her fiancé?! Why, you! You're telling me that you just let her go?! It's not like I could help it! "Fiancé?" You mean that man in black who was accompanied by pigs? A man in black, accompanied by pigs? Oyuki, do you know something? Yes. I seem to recall something being in my business transaction records. Daifuku-chou: Ledger Yes. I seem to recall something being in my business transaction records. Daifuku-chou: Ledger Daifuku-chou: Ledger Do you always carry that thing around with you? Daifuku-chou: Ledger Daifuku-chou: Ledger There it is! That man's name is Rupa. There it is! That man's name is Rupa. World of Darkness... He is from the World of Darkness. It says here that their world is different from ours. It's a sunless world. It is a dark, fearful world... "Dark?" Lum! Lum! Where do you think you're going? The World of Darkness. Here you go, Rei! I'm so happy! More! More! Huh? Who could it be? Huh? Who could it be? Yo, Ran! What's cooking? Huh? Who could it be? Yo, Ran! What's cooking? Yo, Ran! What's cooking? Hello, Ran. Hello, Ran. Excuse us for barging in. Hello, Ran. Wh... Whadda you want? We're gonna borrow your cockpit for a little while. Wh... What the... All set. All set. H... Hey! What the hell! H... Hey! What the hell! You'll bite your tongue if you keep on talking! H... Hey! What the hell! Blast off! You better be all right... ...Lum! Darling! Darling! What's the matter, Lum? Darling's gonna come here to rescue me. No way! That idiot doesn't got that kinda guts! What're you all thinkin' of doin'?! What're you all thinkin' of doin'?! Don't be so uptight, Ran. Oh, there's plenty of food, weapons, and ammo! Don't touch without asking, you jerk! It's not a bad thing, is it? It's to rescue Lum. Why do I need to rescue Lum? Sorry, Ran, for getting you involved, too. If we get back safely, let's go out on a date, okay, Ran? Moroboshi, do you really care about Miss Lum at all? Looks like you're back to your normal self. Oyuki, did you figure out the route to the World of Darkness yet? It says " Go straight into the shadow, and warp from there." "Shadow?" "Shadow?" The nearest point is... the Moon. Engaging warp. Wh... What is that?! It's a UFO! It's heading this way! Oh, my. It will be a near-miss. Oh, my. It will be a near-miss. "Oh, my" won't help us! Lt... It's too bright! What's going on?! What's going on?! M... M... Master Rupa... It's coming from the Airport! The Airport? Then, they must be intruders! Yessir. A ship from the World of Light is here. The World of Light, eh? Then they must be here to get Lum back. It's getting noisy out there, Lum. I bet Darling is here. I bet Darling is here. Do you really think so? Do you really think so? In any case, this is our chance to get out. Do you really think so? Miss Lum, please put on your wedding gown. Escape successful! Why don't you give up, Lum? You can't run away anymore. Now quiet down, and head over to the wedding hall. Master Rupa! You bitch! And we were being nice to you! Master Rupa is the best pig-master on the planet! Don't you use force against my bride! Lemme go! Lemme go! Lum, take a look at this. We captured them at the Airport. That's Ran's UFO... Planet Dark, eh... It sure is dark. It's dark! I'm scared! Whatcha gonna do about my UFO? It was an accident. It was an accident. Hey, you guys, stop all that talking! You guys... You all came to rescue me! Shutaro, Rei, Oyuki, Ran, Benten... Darling isn't here! Benten... Now do you understand? There's no one to rescue you. Master Rupa, sorry to bother you, sir, but isn't that ship... ...isn't that Miss Carla's ship? Miss Carla's ship? Miss Carla's ship? You mean, she's back? You mean, she's back? This is gonna be horrible! You mean, she's back? This is gonna be horrible! This is gonna be horrible! L... Let's hold the wedding ASAP! How strange it is to find that the Moon's shadow... is connected to a pond. Hey! How dare you interfere with my ship's path! Thanks to you, my ship is trashed! But that's no reason to kill someone before getting acquainted! Stop talking nonsense and just sign this marriage license! Oh! You're a girl, I see! Too bad, but we can't get married now. But I wouldn't mind a kiss, at least. You idiot! Lt'll be a wedding, but it'll be a fake wedding! I need to stop a certain man's wedding, no matter what. Hey, calm down! Ow! I beg you, calm down! Master Rupa, your bride's preparations are now taken care of. Oh, good! She sure is pretty! She's the best bride in the whole wide world! But, Master Rupa, the way she's behaving, this wench might go insane at the wedding hall! No need to worry. No need to worry. What the heck is that?! Copying Mushrooms. What the! This is gross! It's me! If the need arises, we'll proceed with the wedding using this duplicate. Only you can do such neat things, Great-grandpa! I won't let you do such a thing! I won't let you do such a thing! What're you doing, Lum?! Oh, damn! We must be damned unlucky to have an accident right off the bat! Definitely! Whatcha gonna do about my ship?! Huh? You sure are persistent. You sure are persistent. Whatcha say?! Here! Here's your friend. Ten, are you all right? Ten, are you all right? Oh, you're all here? Oh, you're all here? What's happening to Lum? Oh, you're all here? It's terrible! Lum's been taken to the wedding hall! Wh... What?! Lum, now that we've come this far, you might as well give up. Lum, now that we've come this far, you might as well give up. There's no way we can have such a nonsensical wedding as this! Darling! I heard that Miss Carla has returned from her trip. Looks like this won't be pretty. Just like I suspected, it's full of guards. Just like I suspected, it's full of guards. Isn't there a backdoor? Isn't there a backdoor? As long as we've got this license... Isn't there a backdoor? ...we should be able to go right through the front entrance. Rupa, how dare you go get married when you have me! I won't let you! I'll kill you, and your bride, too! Hold it! We can't let anyone through without Master Rupa's invitation. We're holding our own wedding ceremony here. This is the marriage license. What do we do? What do we do? I... I guess it'll be all right. I... I guess it'll be all right. OK, you may go though. I... I guess it'll be all right. Why, aren't you Miss Carla?! Damn, no point in trying to keep a secret that's been exposed! Master Rupa! Master Rupa! What is it? What is it? M... Miss Carla is... What is it? C... C... C... Carla?! Rupa! It's so cruel of you to hold your wedding behind my back! Lum! Darling! You've come for me, Darling! Oh no you don't! So you're the bitch who stole Rupa from me! Lemme go! Lemme go! You hide in there for a while. Open up! Open up! Great-grandpa... Great-grandpa... I know. Do as I taught you. Do as I taught you. Yes, sir. Rupa, where did you go? Rupa, where did you go? Carla, don't butt in! We're in love! We're in love! Whatcha just say?! None of your impertinence, you kidnapper! Come on, Lum, we're going back. Hey, Lum! So long! I'm getting married to Rupa! Stop kidding around, or I'll get mad. Don't you see I've come all this way to save you? Rupa! You're being fooled by that girl! Lum, why don't you say something?! Lum, why don't you say something?! Rupa! Rupa! Oh, shut up! Rupa! Get out of here! We're in the middle of our wedding ceremony! That's right. That's right. Lum... Why, you! Let me out! Let me out of here! If only I had my horns, I could easily get out of this place! Hey, move it, will ya! Rupa, did you lie to me? Wh... What are you talking about?! Wh... What are you talking about?! You said you loved me! But, that was... that was when we were kids! Besides, you forced me into saying that! " You love me, right? You love me, right?" "You do love me, don't you?" "Y... Yeah. I love you." T... That was something you forced me into saying! Then you're saying it was... a LIE?! D... D... Damn right it was! In fact, I hate your guts! What... What's with that look on your face? Oh, I see now... C... Carla... I'll kill you, and then I'll kill myself! What's going on up there? Darling... Darling, where are you? Darling! Don't come near me! What's wrong, Darling? Shut up, you cheater! I don't even want to see your face! Darling... What good is it for you to come after me now?! Darling, wait! Rupa, don't you run away from me! Lum's horns fell off. Lum's horns fell off. Oh, that's terrible! What happens when your horns fall off? You lose your powers! You lose your powers! Then we gotta hurry! Hey, you! Why don't you act more like prisoners? Right, howzabout we get going? Damn, they're already at it! Look! On top of that tower! You can't run away any more, Rupa. You still don't feel like getting married to me? Who in the hell would?! Who in the hell would?! Just tell me what's wrong with me?! I hate everything about you! If I had to marry you, I'd... "...rather die," eh?! I didn't say THAT! What're you doing to my Darling? "Darling?" How could you be so forward?! Don't misunderstand me, girl! Darling, quick! Come here! Okay! Not you! Not you! How dare you?! This is starting to look like a big mess. Who's that lady? Carla! Stop it! Carla! Stop it! We can talk it out! What do you mean " we can talk it out?!" Everything is over now! What's that? Great-grandpa! Great-grandpa! I'll save you. Rupa, grab hold! I won't let you get away! Serves you right! Don't you dare try to get away from me! Let me go! What're you gonna do to me?! Darling, save me! What're you just standing there for?! "I'm getting married to Rupa." Wh... What... What are you saying this time?! Darling! Darling... why? Knock it off! Knock it off! Don't you butt in! Don't you butt in! Leave them traitors alone! Don't you butt in! Get the hell out of here now! I'm getting married to this girl here! Darling! You're the one who cheated first! Darling! Darling! Carla! Are you really gonna? We can't talk if you're up there! Come down! Miss Lum, I will save you! Oh, no! They're falling off! Damn right they are, you moron! How terrible! Hold on tight! Carla! Rupa! You... D... Don't get the wrong idea! My hand just happened to reach out! My hand just happened to reach out! L... Lum! Lum! Oh, no! Lum can't fly! Her horns! I know that! Get off! What was that for! I bet you were flirting with that woman while I was having all this trouble! I can't trust you anymore, Darling! Look who's talking! Are you really gonna get married to that guy? Are you really gonna get married to that girl? Why, do you think I'm lying? This marriage certificate proves it! I made up my mind! I'm gonna leave you! Darling, you idiot! Damn! Too late! The horns have grown back. The horns have grown back. Thank goodness... Thank goodness... Definitely. Thank goodness... Aren't you happy, Carla... ...that your groom is okay? You're gonna be his bride. You're gonna be his bride. Rupa, are you serious? Then I'll really get married to him, you got that! Cheers! Cheers! I'm gonna stay here. Do you have a problem with that? Suit yourself, fool. Suit yourself, fool. Rupa, you idiot. Good thing you're all right. But it looks like the subject is getting out of hand, as usual. Have they settled things, I wonder? Lum, are you really serious about not going back? I'm not going back! I'm getting married to Rupa. Moroboshi got fooled by this duplicate. Moroboshi got fooled by this duplicate. So, it's all a big misunderstanding. I still can't forgive him, even considering that. Darling didn't trust me one bit. Why would he think I'd get married to another man?! Until Darling apologizes to me, I'm not going back! I'm telling you, it's still not too late! It's none of your business! It's none of your business! Lum, too, can be really stubborn... Howzabout we head back? Howzabout we head back? What about Miss Lum? What about Miss Lum? She's hopeless... What about Miss Lum? She doesn't listen to us anymore, no matter what we tell her. You're the only one who can talk her into it. But I'm... I'm deeply hurt, too. The only thing that can ease this pain is your love. Oh! You mustn't, not at a time like this! You must cool down. At such a crucial time as this, how could you be so? Oh! You'll chip your sword if you do that... Oh! You'll chip your sword if you do that... Will you knock it off! This is my UFO! Rupa... You didn't stop me after all... Engine, reverse thrust! Engine, reverse thrust! Submerge, okay. Lum, are you sure this is all right? They're really going. So everyone's gone, Lum. Rupa... Are you crying, Lum? It's just the splashing water... It's just the splashing water... Lum... It's been a while, Inaba. Yes. I finally managed to attach knobs to every single door out there. I'm so glad that I can have tea with you like this. Are Ataru and Lum doing well? Well, Lum got kidnapped, and Ataru's gone after her. 'Tis a bad omen! Oh, look at Lum! What could this mean? It's an indication that Lum will be captured by the Dark. Beyond that, the rest is mystery. Oh! Lum is fading away! Oh! Lum is fading away! Wh... What?! It's... It's the Earth. Earth is engulfed by the Darkness. This must be what was meant by that message with Lum in it. Here we go! I'm not gonna apologize! Leave Lum alone and let's get outta here at once! But... But... ...this is Earth. Just like you wanted it. Just like you wanted it. We're back. We're back. You should be glad... Darling. We're back. First he goes away for days on end... ...then he's back with all these friends just in time for dinner. Good evening, Mrs. Moroboshi. How do you do. I'm Inaba. "Nabe:" A vegetable stew with meat. I see you're having nabe tonight! "Nabe:" A vegetable stew with meat. "Nabe:" A vegetable stew with meat. As always, it's nabe with almost no meat! Wh... Why are you here, too?! We've not come here for dinner. We're here to discuss a very important matter concerning Earth's future. Rei, open wide! This nabe has so few goodies in it! There's a lot of things that I don't usually get to eat. This is pretty good. This is pretty good. It sure is a strange food. What do you mean you went to rescue Lum but then you left her?! How could you?! I'm actually glad it happened that way. You've still got that ego problem! Go rescue her again! No way! If she really wants to come back... ...she'd better apologize, and get back here on her own. There's no way a woman can do that on her own initiative! Of course not. Uh-huh. Right? There's no way! So you've known Carla since you were kids? Yeah. We've been together ever since we were born! At first, she wasn't that violent a person. But, then... "Over here! Over here!" " Wait, Carla!" "Her name is Lum. Isn't she cute?" "I'm gonna make her my bride." "But you already have me!" " What don't you like about me?!" "I love you!" No matter how far I ran away, she'd keep coming after me... Compared to that shrew, you're much more... "...much more?" " Much more" what? I'm plenty violent, too. Besides, how can you fall in love with me, when you don't even know me? You thought that any woman would do, didn't you? That's not... Can't you see that Carla's hurt? Well, what am I supposed to do now? Lum... But, if we bring Lum back... ...will that really save Earth? I dunno. I dunno. "I dunno" won't cut it! This may be too big of a problem. Oh, mushrooms! These mushrooms look so good, Rei... No! You can't throw these into nabe! Oh, these mushrooms sure look tasty! I'm not gonna be responsible for this... I'm not gonna be responsible for this... Th... Those mushrooms become gigantic if you expose them to light or heat. I was careful not to bring spores in here, but... What in the world is going on?! What in the world is going on?! I swear, one thing after another! I swear, one thing after another! If light and heat cause them to become large... I swear, one thing after another! If light and heat cause them to become large... If light and heat cause them to become large... ...then what'll happen in the morning? ...then what'll happen in the morning? I dunno. ...then what'll happen in the morning? I dunno. I dunno. "I dunno" won't cut it! This may be too big of a problem. This may be too big of a problem. Is it good, Rei? Is it good, Rei? 'Tis a bad omen. Is it good, Rei? School's closed! School's closed! Let's go home! Let's go home! Hold it! Let's go home! Listen, man, how can we hold class in a building that's in this condition? There's always the school grounds! The grounds! Everybody, line up! Textbooks open to page 43...! It looks like the grounds cannot be used anymore, either. There's more of them sprouting. There's more of them sprouting. The spores are spreading. There doesn't seem to be anything we can do now. No! No! No! Absolutely not! Stop the fuss! From what you've told me, there's only one person in existence... ...who can eliminate the mushrooms. Only Rupa of the Dark Space. No! I never wanna see him again! "In fact, I hate your guts!" After he said that to me... ...how in the world do you expect me to ask him a favor now? For now, make yourself at home. This is my room. Please, help yourself. I'll get some snacks to go with the tea. Look at this room! It's Carla all over. I couldn't help it! She kept sending me all this stuff! It's such a bother! Yeah, right! You love having them, don't you?! Master Rupa, you have a phone call from Miss Carla! Shall I hang up? Shall I hang up? No, well... Umm, you know... What do you mean, "you know?" You don't have to play the tough guy. What took you so long? Ha! What're you bothering me for anyway? The Earth is engulfed in mushrooms. You idiot! What the hell did you do?! "Engulfed in mushrooms?" What does that mean? "Engulfed in mushrooms?" What does that mean? I couldn't help it! Let me set you straight, Rupa. I didn't wanna see your face... ...but I called just because everyone here is in trouble... Yeah, right! You're still after me! You're not in my mind anymore, not even a little! I'm living a happy life with this man. Oh! L... Lum! So am I... So am I... ...l'm living a good life with Lum! The topic of conversation is shifting more and more. Long time no see. You seem happy. It's terrific! Unlike a certain someone, he doesn't flirt around. I, too... am feeling so much better now that we're apart! Will you clowns knock it off! Lum, listen carefully. This is a time of extreme emergency. You must talk Rupa into fixing things. Well, if Darling says that he loves me, then I wouldn't mind talking to Rupa. So she says. Earth's fate hangs on a single word from you. Say it! Even if it's a lie! Say it! Even if it's a lie! On this occasion, I shall permit it. On this occasion, I shall permit it. Is it that difficult? It's just a simple phrase! On this occasion, I shall permit it. You say it all the time to other girls! I HATE YOUR GUTS! Carla, you idiot... Carla, you idiot... Darling... Darling... Darling hasn't... Darling hasn't even once told me that he loved me... Could it be that Darling really... ...hates me? You idiot! Do I have to say it in words before you understand? The unidentified mushrooms that first appeared in Tomobiki Town... ...have since become more potent... ...and as a result, various areas have reported severe damage. Should the mushrooms keep multiplying at this rate... ...the whole of Japan, no, the entire Asian region may! It seems hopeless. It seems hopeless. I've completed my calculations. The mushrooms will cover the entire Earth in about 10 days. In 10 days, eh. So in 10 days, the Earth will be engulfed by Darkness... ...just like the Crystal Ball said. I wonder what will happen. Really, we can't run our businesses in peace! It's horrible! We can't get enough sunlight. Right! We can't dry our laundry. Oh, what could that be? What the heck is that?! They're birds! They're birds! They're grasshoppers! They're grasshoppers! No, they aren't! They're... They're grasshoppers! ...p... pigs?! Oh, look! Pigs from Rupa's homeland. The pigs are... The pigs are... ...munching on the mushrooms! Oh... Oh man! They ate 'em in a flash! Oh! It's Rupa and Lum! This message is for Moroboshi Ataru: As you have seen, the only things that can eliminate the mushrooms are my pigs. If you want the pigs, then have a match against me, Darling. If you play tag with me... ...and grab my horns within 10 days, then you win. Why tag? It's what the Oni people do at fateful times such as this. I'll run and I won't be taking it easy on you. If you wanna catch me, then say you love me. Wh... Who would, you idiot?! You can win this game of tag, can't you? Banner: "Tomobiki-cho choonaikai" (Community group) Justice shall prevail! Banner: "Tomobiki-cho choonaikai" (Community group) Justice shall prevail! Which of you is just?! Banner: "Tomobiki-cho choonaikai" (Community group) Which of you is just?! Banner: "Tomobiki-cho choonaikai" (Community group) Who cares? Just say that you love her! Which of you is just?! Just say it! Which side is just? Hey, you over there, move back a bit, please. Stay behind the line. Allow me to explain the rules again. The match is a game of tag. If Moroboshi Ataru can grab Lum's horns within 10 days... ...I shall loan my mushroom- eating pigs to you. But that's not fair! Lum can fly! Don't worry. She has a handicap this time: She must not fly above the mushrooms. It must be at least 57 meters! It must be at least 57 meters! No, it's more like 62 meters! Get set... If you want to catch me, tell me that you love me! Even without saying it, I'll make you come to me! Look, he moved out of his course! Say, girls, wanna join me for a cup of tea? Gimme your names and phone numbers! Look, she's gone! Look, she's gone! Will you go after her, you fool! Usually, Lum would get upset and go after Ataru in that kind of situation... That means Lum's dead serious about this match... Lum! I'm in love with you! Why does it have to be Moroboshi?! I, on the other hand, can say that I love you from the bottom of my heart! Miss Lum! Mind your own business! And shut up! Lum, you're wrong! Whether I love you or hate you, what difference would words make? Idiot! Idiot! Fool! Idiot! Fool! Buffoon! If you're so pissed off, come down here! You coward! Is that all you have to say? It doesn't look like he can catch her. Just the thought of Earth's future resting on that idiot's shoulders... ...sure sends a chill down my spine. So, having said that, Rupa and Lum's engagement shall be annulled. I never even approved it in the first place. I'll give you the message Lum asked me to relay. Come here. Wh... What?! Lum said that?! It's the sixth day already. Lum and Ataru... they've both got attitude problems! It's like a mudslinging contest! What? What's that? Isn't that Lum's dad's ship? Isn't that Lum's dad's ship? What is he here for? What? Is that for real, man?! What? Is that for real, man?! If Lum's man won't say "I love you..." ...all memories regarding us! What?! What?! Is that for real? Is that for real? Lum is serious. Is that for real? Lum is serious. Lum is serious. If Moroboshi won't say "I love you," then... ...memories of all of us, not just of Lum, will be... ...buried deep within the Darkness, eh? Lum, how could you overreact like this? Does Moroboshi know about this? Not yet. So what if he were to know. It's Moroboshi we're talking about, after all. He's getting more and more stubborn. If it gets any worse, there'll be nothing left for us to do. Oh, how obstinate he is! Oh, how obstinate he is! It may be wisest for us not to tell him then. It's too late for that. It's too late for that. M... Moroboshi! There he is! Come out, Moroboshi! I'm over here! What can we say, now that he's heard it all? Ataru... Say that you love her, if you don't wanna forget about Lum. No way. How dare you, at such a crucial time as this! Shut up! Tell that coward that I'm not backing down! Who're you calling a coward? Who was it that pushed me to this point? You're the one using one cheap trick after another! Even if I were to forget you, it wouldn't give me a pain or even an itch! Oh, really? Why don't you just cut this tag crap... ...wipe all our memories and go back to your planet right now?! Id... Idiot! Why, that's a nice idea! Since that's what you want, I'll wipe out your memories right away! Goodbye, Darling! Hey, wait, Lum! There's no hope, is there... You must cool down, Lum. Y'know, Moroboshi is acting like a pain in the butt, but you're being unreasonable, too! Why don't you think more about his personality before you act? I want you to leave me alone. This is a problem between Darling and me. Why, you... then... ...don't dare put us through this mess, too! Listen to me! I've gotten to like these Earthpeople pretty well! If you wanna leave him, then go move your ass back to your planet by yourself! If I see you activate the Memory- Erasing Device... ...it'll be the end between you and me! Say something, Lum! Benten... Benten... What is it, OI' man? What is it, OI' man? That table's... What is it, OI' man? ...the activation switch for the Memory-Erasing Device! I'm not gonna forget... I won't forget... "Goodbye, Darling..." "This is goodbye..." Lum! I haven't... forgotten... You haven't found it yet? You haven't found it yet? No, sir. By the way, Young Master, what is it that we are looking for? How many times do I have to tell you?! THE MEMORY-ERASING DEVICE! Th... That's a long name. Hey! How many times do I have to tell you?! The Memory-Erasing Device's timer is already ticking away! Good thing the timer is set for the final day, Benten. Shut up! Quit saying that! No matter what you do, it's impossible for you to grab Lum's horns! So, please, will you tell Lum that you love her, just once? I refuse! You idiot! If Lum is Lum, then Moroboshi is Moroboshi! Ultimately, our only choice is for us to stop the device by ourselves. But, where exactly is this particular device? Umm... I've been wondering for a while, but what is that? It's been flying by our side for a while now. It's the Memory-Erasing Device! This? Lt... It's sure got a silly face on it! So all we need to do is destroy that thing. That should be easy. Prepare the fighters at once! No, no! You gotta use these! We are prepared to fight 'til the end, to fulfill our duties. That's fine, but aren't these kind of unreliable as weapons? You may be right about that, yes, but... Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah, I'm all set! Will this do it? Will this do it? There, Rei. That's fine. GO! Why you! What're you doing? We're trying to hit that deactivation switch with these balls! So that's the Memory-Erasing Device whose switch you activated. Shut up! Damn! Quit dodging around like that! Dammit! Go! Go! Mendou Clan Mobile Armored Corps! Move out! FIRE! How could the Mendou Clan Mobile Armored Corps be defeated just like that? This calls for the final option! Mendou SXR-7000-Tako, come on out! Now do you understand the true power of the Mendou Clan? If an idiotic robot like you can beat me, I'm not Mendou Shutaro! Let's kick butt! All we can do now is to depend on Ataru... Looks like it. Darling, I beg you, just once, say you love me. I can't understand this. Why can't he say such a simple thing as that? It's hard to say it, once you fail to say it. I've been looking for you, Carla. Rupa... What do you want, after all we've just gone through. I was ready to let them use my pigs, regardless of how the game ended. But I changed my mind. If you don't come back... ...l'm not gonna loan my piggies to the Earthpeople! What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? "What do I mean?" Don't you understand? How am I supposed to understand? How am I supposed to understand? How could you be such a slow woman?! Say what?! You wanna fight or something?! Don't you see that I'm asking you to be my bride, you fool?! What do you mean, "you fool?!" Why am I supposed to be your... What? Be my bride. Rupa... Ataru looks pretty exhausted. What a stubborn idiot! What a stubborn idiot! There's only one day left. There's only one day left. The food supply has run out, too. There's only one day left. "Takoyaki:" Pancake balls containing octopus. Sorry to keep you waiting! How would you like some nice hot takoyaki?! There! It's freshly made! It's Hamajaya's takoyaki, the kind that can even warm the depths of your soul! Dad! Oh, Ryuunosuke. Help me out, will ya? What're you saying?! At such a crucial time as this, how could you be baking takoyaki?! What're you talking about, Ryuunosuke? It's because it's such a time as this that we have a chance to renovate Hamajaya! You fool! If Moroboshi doesn't say that he loves Lum, all is lost! Don't you see that?! I see. So, he can't say that, Ryuunosuke? Those words are pretty hard to say, when you're young. It is because I, your father, could not speak those words... ...that I could not provide you a mother. But I can say those words now. Masako, I love you! Momoe, I love you! O, Ocean... I... LOVE... YOU! You fool! You fool! I love you! How can you sleep so innocently? Tomorrow's sunset is the deadline for us all. And then, it'll be the end. You bullied me all this time... ...and now that I can forget about you, I feel a hell of a lot better! The fact that we won't be together any- more ain't gonna make me sad at all! I'm not sad! Goodbye. This is the Judgment Day! This is the Judgment Day! Do something! Do something! Give it up! Do something! Give it up! Give it up! Hey! Hey! Run quicker! Hey! Run! Run! Don't slow down! Benten... Oyuki, Ran... and Rei... ...I wanted to say just one thing. That I've really come to like you. Even if I were to forget about you after today's sunset, what I feel now is no lie. Me, too. Me, too! W... We know that already. Banner: "Organization Committee" W... We know that already. Banner: "Organization Committee" Hang in there! Why doesn't he just say it? Yeah... Lum, of course, is a bit different, but she's a good girl... Yeah... Lum and her man are both really stubborn! After the sun sets... ...we have to forget about Lum. How can we tolerate such a thing as that?! Why?! Why do we have to forget about you, Lum?! You're my dream... my love... my reason for living! Yes, you meant everything to my youth! My youth was full because of you! Once you take away my memories of you, what is there left for me? Lum! Lum! Moroboshi! Give up and say you love her! We had plenty of good times... I don't wanna forget! Why? Why won't you say that you love me? I don't care if it's a lie. Even if it's a lie, I want you to say it! You fool... If I say I love you under these circumstances... ...you won't know if it's true or not! Darling... Fool. Why do you have to go through all this just for one simple phrase? Get up, Moroboshi! You know you've got far more energy than that! Get up, and go catch Lum! Get up, and go catch Lum! Yeah! Moroboshi, get up! Yes, Ataru! Get up! Get up, Moroboshi! Get up, Moroboshi! Get up! Get up! M... Moroboshi... H... He got up! OK! Now that it's come to this, let's go watch their final moments first hand! With just one word from you, everything would be fine... Why? Darling, you idiot! Do you really wanna forget about me? I'll never forget! I'll never forget! I... I'll never... forget! "Darling... Do you love me?" I... I'll never forget! "Get up! Get up!" I'll never forget! I'll never forget! "Are you worried about me?" I'll never forget! I'll never forget! I'll never forget! I'll never forget! I'll never forget! I... I'LL NEVER FORGET! ...you, Lum... M... My horns... You kept them all this time... You hardheaded dummy! DARLING! Darling, you hardheaded dummy! Lum, you... idiot! You've reached the goal! All right! All right! Earth is saved! Moroboshi! Moroboshi! Lum! Lum! All right! Lum! How dare he make us feel so threatened! It's a good thing the Memory-Erasing Device has stopped. It's a good thing the Memory-Erasing Device has stopped. Looks like they've settled things okay. So, shall we take care of the mushrooms and go home? So, shall we take care of the mushrooms and go home? Seems Lum's man has grabbed Lum's heart again. Well, shall we go back home? And so it all ends without him saying that he loves her? What a jerk! What a jerk! Are you kidding us citizens? You guys! Are you going to continue this fuss all your life?! Haven't you had enough of it yet? Moroboshi, after all you've done to put Earth in danger, how dare you?! There's no sign of remorse in you! Just take a look at the school building in disarray! How're we gonna hold classes tomorrow? Enough is enough! Moroboshi! Ataru! Will you cut the crap and just say you love her?! Even if it takes a lifetime, I'll make you say it. I'll say it on my deathbed!
