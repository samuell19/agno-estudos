[ "Hard to Get" by Starclub plays ] Monday... Monday, go away and come again another day I'm sick and tired of Tuesdays. Wednesday's good for bad. Sitting in the office on a wet 'n' windy Thursday. Warm 'n' dead on Friday I don't wanna live, day to go. Oh, don'tcha know. Oh, don'tcha know. Hard to get. Hard to get. Hard to get. Uh-huh-huh. Oh, yeah. You can get it. If you lose it. But don't forget. Uh-huh-huh. Oh. Oh, yeah. Hard to get. Hard to get. Hard to get. Uh-huh-huh. Ooh. Oh, yeah. Hard to get. Hard to get. Hard to get. Uh-huh-huh. Oh, yeah. You can get it. If you lose it. Then don't forget. Uh-huh-huh. Oh [ Tires screech ] [ Sighs ] [ Engine running ] - [ Rollerblades hitting pavement ] - [ Birds chirping ] [ Dog barking ] [ Doorbell rings ] WOMAN: Yes? MAN: Yeah, I saw your sign out front. And I was wondering if I could see the guest house. Well actually, I just got out here. But you do work mostly at home? Uh-huh. I really need the peace and quiet. This is so great. You see, I'm always in court. My husband Cliff complains he spends more time in airports than at home. We'd both... feel better if there was someone around. [ Piano playing ] [ Birds chirping ] I'll take it. Great. Now, it's... it's a little run-down on the inside, but there's plenty of spare furniture in the garage. You're welcome to help yourself to anything you'd like. [ Piano plays ] That's my daughter, Adrian. Oh, I think we met... out front on the street. Oh. She seemed very, uh... Headstrong is what I call it. [ Laughs ] But I'm sure you two will get along fine. - [ Birds chirping ] - [ Dog barking ] [ Sighs ] [ "My House" by Chris Kowanko plays ] Just like a toy I was waitin' for you. But you never came. And I found myself alone... - Hello. - Get down. What's the big deal? My parents rented out the guest house. To who? Some guy. Look, check him out. If you're not back in five minutes, I'll radio for air support. Okay. I waited for you. But you never came. On the way back to my house I had to hesitate. MAN: Who goes there? What? MAN: Identify yourself. Friend or foe? Depends. [ Drops tool ] Some time today... You got a name? Cheyenne. MAN: Oh, Injun, huh? Hippie parents. Oh. Later. Should I speak. When I saw that man? I think I saw that face I would like to give you more. I heard that's what we're all here for. Well? Well, he's okay. Kind of cool. Old. [ Birds chirping ] [ Elevator bell ] [ Phone ringing ] [ Office chatter ] Hi. I'm Nick Eliot. I'm here to see Michael. Nick Eliot? You're late. - It's not even 8:30. - Monday meeting starts at 8:15. What I'm concerned about is the focus on this. MAN: Go on. WOMAN: You've got to do it. - WOMAN 2: Good eye. - WOMAN 3: Good. WOMAN: Oh, okay, what are you working on right now? WOMAN 2: Oh, I'm still researching the article. New here? I can tell. MAN: All right. Let's get down to business. Tanya Terrel on the cover. If she wants to expose herself and her body, I'll be happy to oblige her. I need more pictures inside, but keep the text under 1,000 words. The Senate arms deal is dead. Nobody cares, and the weeklies are beating it to death. Now, Nicholas Eliot, Monday's staff meetings begin at 8:15 precisely. I expect everyone to be here. Oh, ahem, my apologies. I, uh, just got into town. Do you really think I don't know who you are, Mr. Eliot? Your former superiors describe you as an excellent researcher with only fair writing skills. In fact, one of them, described you as a pit bull when you're on the scent. And that's precisely why I hired you. Now, Mr. Eliot... tell me, what do you know about Robert Levansky? Only that he just got out of jail and refuses to talk to the press. He embezzled almost $2 billion, 500 million of which remains unaccounted for. I want you to dig up everything you can. Come on, 1,000 reporters have been on that for months. It's a black hole. I'll expect something by Friday. Maddik, track Eliot. If he finds anything, I want pictures. Mr. Hurley. - Is he always like this? - [ Snickers ] Sometimes he's in a bad mood. Oh. [ "So Good" by Miracle Legion plays ] [ Scrubbing ] And every day. Must I... wait on you hand and foot? On the way past, I... One time when you made me feel so good... So how much they paying you to watch me? Ribbons in your hair... Just renting the guest house. - They were never there. - Oh. It's not a subscription... Why are you doing that? Well... I'm gonna have her painted now that I can finally afford it. So, uh... Fox hunt? Polo? No. I'm schooling jumpers. I'm gonna be the youngest in my class to go to Nationals. Really? Sounds ambitious. Yeah, well... if only my ride would show, maybe I could get to practice. This one will never mend. To show before a friend. Hello. Mario Analdi? Hi. Nick Eliot. Pique magazine. I was wondering if you might be able to answer a few questions for us. You used to work for the Levansky family, is that right? [ Whispering ] I think we have something. Yes. [ Beep ] [ Fan running ] Very attractive. Oh, this? Helps me think. Hmm. Come in, come in. [ Sighs ] So what are you doing? Ooh, pretty dry stuff, really. You wouldn't be interested. Try me. Okay. Uh... you ever hear of Robert Levansky? The arbitrage guy who stole a lot of money. Allegedly stole. Uh, anyway, I found his chauffeur. He told me that he regularly drove Levansky up to a house in Knollwood. Seems Levansky had a... a friend. You mean a lover? [ Clears throat ] Well, yeah, yeah. Yes, um... Anyway, it turns out this woman flew to Geneva six times last year. Ooh, Swiss bank accounts loaded with the missing cash. [ Fan running ] You sure you're only 14? Almost 15. Isn't it way past your bedtime? YES. Uh-huh. [ Clears throat ] Um... [ Chuckles ] So, um... whose pool? That's Rockford's. They're in Maine. Guess they keep it lit up for burglars. Now, who would want to steal a pool? [ Panting ] [ Water running ] [ Turns off water ] [ Sighs ] [ Door closes ] Hello? ADRIAN: Hi! [ Sighs ] You know, most people knock. ADRIAN: I did. You didn't hear. [ Sighs ] Is this you? NICK: Mm-hmm. That is me and David Cummings. Who? NICK: Dave Cummings! He's one of the great reporters of his generation. One time or another, he had a byline in every paper across the country. He was also my grandfather. You were so cute. Can I have it? It's the only one I have. - Please? - No. You always write on a computer? I'd be lost without it. Makes you wonder how your grandfather got along. Then, again, he wasn't writing for trendy magazines, was he? Ha ha ha. Now, will you get out of here and let me get dressed? [ Birds chirping ] I got you something. Oh, yeah? What? Open it and find out. [ Chuckles ] Wow. Cool. Thank you, Adrian. Now I'm late. Um, you're going to come to my parents' party on Saturday night, aren't you? Uh, I don't know, Adrian. My mother invited you, didn't she? Yeah, but I have a lot of work. Please, it's going to be all of Mom's boring old friends. I'll try. Not good enough. I said I'll try. Now let me go. Pretty please? Out! [ Sighs ] [ Telephone rings ] Damn. - Hey, is that your article? - Yeah, it just came in. Great. Will you two come on? Michael's waiting. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's something very wrong here. Good work, Maddik. Thank you. Hid in the rose bushes two hours to get that money shot. Mm-hmm. Um, Michael, I was wondering if I might have a chance to go over that before you read it. I think, maybe one of the copy editors... The editors haven't touched it. The article's fine as it stands. Samantha, get this to the art department. We're resetting the whole issue. You got the cover, Maddik. I think you owe it to your friend here. All right! Thank you, sir. [ Intercom buzzes ] Michael, Mr. Siegal's office is holding on line six. Eliot... Not only is your research excellent, but your text is clean, concise. You even have some style. Thank you. - [ Music plays ] - [ Crickets chirping ] [ Car horn beeping ] What the hell. [ Crickets continue chirping ] [ Piano plays ] Hi. Hi. Oh, Nick! Nick, I'm so glad you could make it. Honey, honey, this is Nick. Nick, this is my husband Cliff Forrester. Hello. My wife speaks very highly of you. How's everything out back? Oh, well, it's great, sir. You have a beautiful place. Thank you. You enjoy it. Thank you. Honey, honey, look, there are the Mortons. Oh, my God, I think she's had her eyes done. Oh, yeah, Saperstein did her eyes five years ago. No. No, it's her breasts I was wondering about. [ Sighs ] Excuse us, Nick. Come on. Hang in there, Nick. [ Piano playing ] [ Crowd chatter ] [ Laughing ] [ Piano plays ] Excuse me. [ Piano playing ends ] [ Applause ] That was lovely, Adrian. Thank you. Thanks. I knew you'd come. I tell you, if you were 10 years older... You'd what? So, how did your boss like the article? It was you? You rewrote it? Hi, Mr. Fogel! FOGEL: Hello, Adrian! Wait a minute? How'd you get in? It ain't Fort Knox. Adrian, you can't do that. It worked, though, didn't it? Poor Nick. You have such a terrible time with the objective case, and your split infinitives put such a stress on the adverb. Adrian, you just can't go around doing that. It isn't right. I just wanted you to like me. Of course I like you. Then, take me for a ride in the Valiant. Now? Yeah, just for a little while. There's a place I want to show you. I... I don't know. Please? [ Snickers ] [ Bell ringing ] [ Bell ringing continues ] Come on, I want to show you. Adrian! [ Bell ringing ] [ Crickets chirping ] Beautiful, isn't it? Yeah, it is. [ Waves crashing ] Look, I'm sorry about the article, and I won't do it again. Look, I know I'm not the world's greatest writer, but, uh... believe me, it's... hard to take being bettered by a 14-year-old kid. It's okay, really. No, it's not. You don't know how hard it is for me to make friends. I mean, my parents made me skip two grades in school. [ Sighs ] My only friend is Cheyenne, and it's only because... Well, my mom and her mom went to college together, so... she kind of has to. It's like everybody thinks I'm some kind of freak or something, like I'm crazy. Hey, hey. Come on. We can be friends. You don't have to. I know I don't have to. It's not a "have to" kind of thing. [ Bell ringing ] [ Laughing ] That's better. Please don't be afraid of me. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? What? We got to go. Nick! Come on, come on. [ Exhales deeply ] Good night, darlin'. Good night. I love you, Mommy. [ Crickets chirping ] [ Lawn mower running ] [ Beep ] [ Sighs ] [ "Taste" by Auto & Cherokee plays ] You can taste that. If you want. Mmm. You can taste that. If you want. Mmm. You can taste that if you want. You can taste that. If you want. Mmm. You can taste that. If you want. Mmm. You can taste that if you want [ Birds chirping ] - [ Laughter ] - Nicholas, darling! Oh, hi, Adrian. This is my friend Amy. - Hi. - My landlord's kid. Hi. NICK: See ya. "Nicholas"? AMY: My "darling"? [ Laughs ] Wow. [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] Baby, can't you see... - Nick? - Yeah? - You won't believe who's here. - Who? Oh, my God. Michael! [ Laughs ] Hi. Jeez, I... I thought you knew it was a barbecue. Eliot, I wanted to tell you personally. I've been on the phone all morning with the lawyers. Robert Levansky wants to speak with you. You're kidding. I'm setting up a meeting. It'll be an exclusive. And he's making you part of the deal. Very good. But why? I don't know. Frankly, I don't care. I suppose he saw something in the article that impressed him. Ah, yes. Um... here. A gift. Oh... thank you. That's a very fine bottle of wine. I'd let it breathe for at least an hour. As you were. "As you were"? Well, uh... wine and marshmallows, anyone? - Yay! - Yeah! Here. We need some sticks. Okay. I'll scout the orchard. [ Click ] [ Birds chirping ] Ow. [ Buzzing ] [ Sighs ] Fuck. [ Buzzing continues ] ADRIAN: Hi. You scared me. What are you doing? Um... Sticks for marshmallows, you know? But those bees. Wasps. Yellowjackets... Genus Vespula. They all sting. Bees won't bother you unless you bother them. Wasps are different. They're territorial, and they're social. Social? Like they want to be friends? Like they attack in groups. We should leave. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. [ Laughing ] Hey, looks like Nick made a friend. God, she's so pretty. She's like a model. If you like that kind of thing. Oh, don't worry, Amy. Some guys really like girls with small breasts. AMY: What's with your friend Adrian? What do you mean? I thought you guys were hitting it off. Yeah. I know, but she gives me the creeps. [ Sighs ] She's just a kid. She's got a crush on you. Don't be silly. ADRIAN: Hi. It's me. Just thinking of you. God, that sounds corny. Oh, well, call me when you get a sec, okay? Oh, say hi to Amy. Bye. [ Beep ] Look, Nick, I've been there. You have to be the adult. You can't blur the line. What, are you saying I did something to provoke this? Well, did you? No. Of course not. [ Telephone rings ] Hello? ADRIAN: Miss me? NICK: Uh, hello, Adrian. What ya doin'? NICK: What do you think I'm doin'? What am I always doin'? I'm workin'. Aw, Nick. Can't you come out and play? No, Adrian. I'm under deadline. Guess what. What? Got my period. I'm definitely not pregnant. Not that I had any reason to be. Adrian... Yeah? Did you take my picture, the one of me and my grandfather? No. Why would I do that? All right. I'll talk to you later. [ Birds chirping ] Adrian! Hello? Anybody home? [ Faucet turns ] [ Water running ] [ Water turned off ] Cliff. Hi. Nick, well, uh... What are you doing here? Oh, you mean, here? Well, I was just, uh... returning a book to Adrian. She's upstairs. Oh. So, anyway, I... I really got to get going. - Nick. - Yeah. Could you give me a hand getting this stuff upstairs? I don't think my back's going to make it. Well, I... Oh, it'll just take a minute. Sure appreciate it. You are a pal. [ Cliff sighs ] Uh, careful there, my man. I don't need any lawsuits. You know what I mean? [ Sighs ] My little restoration project. [ Fan running ] It's, um... really something. Yeah. I had it shipped out here from a carnival in Kansas right after Adrian was born. Dragged every damn piece up here, one at a time. Want to see it work? Sure. [ Music plays in slow speed ] Well, the motor's kind of old, you know? It takes a little while to get up to speed. Anyway... [ Music stops ] You get the idea. Plan was to turn this whole attic into a kind of playroom, you know, for Adrian. The only problem was... she never took to it. Now I can't get the damn thing down. You know, Nick, Adrian's a... very special girl. Mm-hmm. She's, um... She's very bright. This past year, she's really, uh... blossomed... Physically, I mean. Mmm. I noticed. You know, I swear to God, not a night goes by I don't lay awake dreading that knock on the door. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? Not really. Oh, some friggin' kid will be standing there with his hard-on sticking out his pants. Hope I don't go breaking it off. [ Laughing ] Heh. [ Chuckling ] [ Laughing ] Yeah. - Hi, Daddy. - Huh? Oh, hi, sweetheart. We were just talking about you. Hi. You scared me. I didn't know who was up here. Ah, I was just showing Nick your carousel. It's your carousel, Dad. Remember, I ride real horses now? Well, I really ought to get going. Oh, Adrian, what book did you loan Nick? Book? [ Sighs ] Oh. Well, that must have been Wuthering Heights. Did you like it? YES. Very much. CLIFF: Hmm. Wuthering Heights, huh? Sounds a little femme to me. Anyway, I... [ Clears throat ] I really ought to go. Bye, Nick. Thanks for returning the book. [ Dog barking ] [ Bird squawking ] Hi. Can I talk to you a sec? Sorry? I was wondering if we could talk. What do you want to talk about? Well, um... I don't know. To tell you the truth, it's... it's a little awkward. Uh... Would you mind stopping that? Why? Never mind. I hardly know where to begin. I... I guess what I want to say is... I really like you, Adrian. I really like you, too. No, I... I mean, as a friend. I mean, let's face it. You're 14. I'm 28. That's a big difference. Whatever you say. No. No. Seriously, Adrian. Now, I want you to know you can count on me. I'll always be your friend, no matter what, okay? Okay. Like that night up at the lighthouse when we kissed? Now, that was a mistake, Adrian. Was sneaking in to watch me undress a mistake, too? [ Bird squawking ] Hmm? Nick... Ever do a virgin? What? I know you want to. Now, look. Let's avoid any confusion here! I'm gonna make this very simple for you. You're... You're too young for me! There's nothing between us! Nothing! [ Snickers ] Hmm. [ Chuckles ] Wait till you see this. I can't believe you bought me a car. I didn't. It's not going to make me feel any different about you. Really, I didn't buy you a car. Then, what's the surprise? Wait right here. Okay. Grab an end. - You ready? - Ooh, never been so ready. Huh? Check it out. Factory paint. I got matching vinyl interior. This is one of the finest pieces of iron ever came out of Detroit. Sugar? Well, um... if you didn't, uh, actually see her... Is that right? Well, no, I didn't actually see her. So you're not absolutely certain. Well, no, I'm... not absolutely. But... But I do feel... But I... I just... I just feel very strongly that she did this. Mm-hm. Hi. I'm going out with Cheyenne. Hi, Nick. Adrian... I have a question for you. Hmm? Did you scratch up Nick's car? [ Laughs ] Why would I do that? Gotta go. Bye. CLIFF: Well, uh, that's that, then. Can I have some of that newspaper there? Not the crossword. Hey, Cheyenne. I... I need to talk to you... about Adrian. What? Not now. Meet me in back of the orchard at 7:00 when the streetlights come on, okay? Cheyenne, wait. Wait. Hey, Cheyenne. Why are you so slow? Everybody asks me that. WOMAN: Cheyenne, come on! We're waiting! Shit! Oh, don't worry about it. You go get dressed, and I'll take care of Buttercup. Sure. [ Horse neighs ] WOMAN: Come on, Kimmy. Gotta keep a feel of her through the triple. That's good. Just relax. Thanks for helping me tack her up. Sure. [ Birds chirping ] WOMAN: Good. Adrian, let's go! Bye. Good luck. Good luck. WOMAN: Cheyenne, you're up! [ Clucks ] [ Whinnying ] [ Crying ] WOMAN: Keep her steady. Don't let her move. Call Mr. Gassinger! Willie, get after that horse! - WOMAN: Cheyenne. - WOMAN 2: Hold still. Cheyenne, are you okay? [ Groans ] WOMAN: Hang on. Just hold on to us. [ Horse neighs ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Twig cracking ] [ Continued twig cracking ] Cheyenne? [ Twig cracking ] Adrian! You scared the hell out of me. Just out for a little stroll? [ Sighs ] I thought you were Cheyenne. So, now you like Cheyenne? Don't be ridiculous. Maybe you'd like to visit her in the hospital. Hospital? What are you talking about? Cheyenne took a little spill at riding today. Is she all right? She'll be okay. It just goes to show you, Nick. You can never be too careful. Go ahead. I'll be right there. [ Dog barking ] Hi, Amy. Hello, Adrian. You know, I was wondering. Have you ever been out to the lighthouse? You mean Shelter Point? Yeah. Make-out place. Not since high school. It's nice. You should definitely go. Nick took me. Maybe he'll take you sometime. Hi. First, let me remind you about the benefit next Sunday... mandatory attendance. Nicholas, what do you got for us? Well, why don't we wait for the printout that should be here any minute. What was Levansky like? What I want to know is, is it true about his hair? [ Laughing ] It was kind of interesting. I was sitting in what must have been his den, right? And there are pictures everywhere... him with the governor, the White House... [ Whispering ] Excuse me. Uh, excuse me one minute. [ Office chatter ] What is it? It's blank. What? I don't know what to tell you. There's nothing on it. What are you talking about? Something wrong, Eliot? No, no. Um... Must have brought the wrong file. It's okay. I have plenty of copies at home. I'll be right back. [ Beep ] [ Beep ] [ Beep ] [ Telephone rings ] Yeah? It's gone, Amy. The whole thing... The interview, the disks, my cassettes, my notes, everything. She came in here and completely fucked me! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you talking about? Adrian. Who do you think I'm talking about? Biggest story of my career, and she... she wipes me out. What do you want me to do? I really need you to cover for me with Michael. Can you do that? - NICK: Hello? - I'll try. Great. Thanks. And, Amy? As soon as I finish rewriting this thing, I'm out of here for good. Smart move, Eliot. All right. Bye. [ Phone ringing ] - Yeah. - ADRIAN: I think we should talk. [ Phone ringing ] Fuck. [ Phone ringing ] NICK: Hi. I'm not in. You know the procedure. [ Beep ] ADRIAN: Nick, this is pretty pathetic. I know you're there. Why don't you just answer. Answer the fucking phone! [ Beep ] [ Beep ] [ Beep ] Ugh! Uhh! You sure you want the Kryptonite? It's 40 bucks extra. [ Beep ] Give me the Kryptonite. MICHAEL: I like the technique, but does it make me want to read the magazine? First and foremost. For one thing, I can't understand what's written down here. - It's all in... - I found it. MICHAEL: Egyptian hieroglyphics. Look, if you're going to use this lettering, you have to use it right. Make it simple, make it mean something. People out there are very simple-minded. Treat them such. All right, go back and do it again. I'll get a plumber in to fix the shower and have my grandson give you a fresh coat of paint. First of the month sound all right? I was... kinda hoping to move in this week, if it's all right with you. Well, why don't we let your check clear and get that shower fixed? I'll let you know first thing next week. Great. Thank you, Mrs. Tinkerman. Really, thank you. Hi. Hey. Brought you a present, Nick. Cool. I don't think we need to let it breathe, do you? No, I don't think so. Looks like you took care of everything. Pretty much. If it's worth anything, I'm glad you're moving. You're glad. I'm overjoyed. [ Laughing ] [ Pulls out cork ] Hey, Nick. Yeah? I got to ask you a question. Shoot. Next week, Michael's benefit... Are you going? Well, we, uh... have to, right? I want you to go with me. What, you mean, like together, on a date? Okay. Never mind. I know I shouldn't have... No, no, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Whatever happened to, um... "Don't get your meat where you lay your eggs" thing? - Bread. Where you make your bread. - Bread. Bread, right. [ Sighs ] Well... I wouldn't wanna... see you slow dance with Samantha. Mm-hm. Or some 13-year-old. 14. [ Laughing ] Yeah... wouldn't like that. [ Crickets chirping ] [ Distant banging ] [ Banging and grunting ] Adrian! What are you doing? Making lemonade. Want some? Hello, Adrian. How are you today? - Fine. - That's good. Hey, Amy. What? What did you do last night? What do you mean? I mean, you slept at Nick's, didn't you? Adrian... Well, I mean, you didn't... you know. Adrian... Let me explain a little something to you. One day, when you're all grown up and you have a real relationship, you'll realize your feelings for Nick were just a thing. Just a crush. In fact, I bet by the time school starts, you'll have completely forgotten all about him. God, Amy... when I grow up, I hope I can be just as smart as you. Adrian... - Go Play- - [ Buzzing ] [ Engine starts ] [ Bird squawking ] [ Coughing ] [ Indistinct ] [ Buzzing ] Oh, my God. [ Buzzing ] [ Screaming ] [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] No! No! No! No! [ Birds chirping ] [ Telephone rings ] NICK: Hello. Oh, hi, Michael. No, no. I was just going over a few things. - [ Knock on door ] - Really? Can I come in? No. It's fine. What is it? Sorry. MICHAEL: There's been an accident. Don't want to bug you. Just wanted to give you the info on the competition. Wh... What happened? What? Oh, Jesus! Um... yeah. Wh... Where is it? Okay. I'll be right over. All right. Bye. What's wrong? Uh... it's Amy. She's at the hospital. She's been in some kind of accident. Oh, Nick! I'm so sorry. [ Sighs ] MAN: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome all of you to the Regional Junior Jumping Championships. He literally cried on my shoulder. Poor baby. Broke my heart. So, how is she? Oh... well, they think she'll live, but... Anyway, I think it's brought Nick and I a lot closer. Well, you'll sit with him, won't you? If I see him... If he comes. He'll be here. Aren't you going to tell me to break a leg? Break 'em both. MAN: First off is number 87... Miss Linda Mattheson riding Snowdrop. Number 191... Miss Kelly Sensabough riding Ace High. - MAN: Number 62... - Give them to me. MAN: Nicole Nairwood... Sheena's Wind. MAN: Number 183... Miss Adrian Forrester riding Sinbad. MICHAEL: I think it's important in our busy lives that we remember those less fortunate. I'd like to thank you all for your generosity and hope you will continue to support our cause. And with that, I'd like to introduce you to the American president of NANDEC, Miss Abigail Spaulding. Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing here? Missed you at the show. Did something come up? Go on, get out of here. Too busy kissing ass to care about me, is that it? [ Crowd murmuring ] Ow! Forgive us. I'll have him back in a jiffy. Ow! That's it! I want you to stay the fuck away from me! - I thought we were... - We're nothing! I love you, Nick, and you love me. You're sick. [ Screams ] You fucking...! [ Screaming continues ] [ Panting ] You're pathetic. Mrs. Tinkerman! Mrs. Tinkerman, it's me, Nick Eliot. The apartment's taken. What? What are you talking about? I don't rent to drug dealers! Oh, God! TINKERMAN: The girl you rent from told me! Mrs. Tinkerman, she's lying! Mrs. Tinkerman! I'll give you three to get out of here. 1... [ Kids yelling ] [ Car horn ] - Nicholas Eliot? - Yeah? Put your hands on your head and step slowly from the car. What's going on? Shut up and get out of the car now. You mind telling me what this is all about? I'm going to tell you. You're under arrest. What? For sexual assault of a minor. What? What are you talking about? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Will you wait a second? Damn it! Honey, honey, I know. Cliff! You fucking animal! - Wait! - You animal! Get him off me! Get him off me! Cliff! Get him off me! Stay back! Watch your head. [ Chatter on police radio ] We went swimming... and hung out a couple of times, but it was nothing. And, um... he just wouldn't take no for an answer. And he... he threw me down, and, um... hit me. And he... he just kept hitting me, and I was crying. [ Sobbing ] He kept hitting me and yelling. [ Sobbing ] I was so scared. Honey, it'll be okay. Ought to just put Dad in the room with him, call it a day. From the clay I moved in, she's been hassling me. You know, uh, she calls me up in the middle of the night, hanging around the house. Uh, she... She breaks into the place. You know, she scratches up my car. I mean, the girl is completely spun. Why won't anyone fucking believe me? You ever have sexual contact of any kind with...? You think I'm crazy? No! You ever, at any time, place your penis inside of her vagina? I just told you, no! I mean, she's crazy! She's the one you ought to lock up! You rape a little girl, you act like she's crazy? I didn't do anything! Jesus Christ! Did you check out that... That room in the garage, the one with the shrine? Did you check it out? We got a problem, Nick. Big problem. What? We found semen inside of her. Let's go. LAWYER: The parents are taking the girl away tonight, down the coast somewhere. Until that time, you're not permitted within 100 feet of the house. After they've gone, you can gather your possessions and move out. It doesn't matter where, just away. The semen sample matches your blood type. Look... I figured it out. She got hold of a condom, she must have snuck in and, uh, stolen one from the trash. Michael... I swear I never laid a hand on her. You got to believe me. She... She's crazy. She's also a little girl... A 14-year-old girl. Now, you be the jury. [ Crickets chirping ] [ Bang ] Ow! Goddamn it! Jesus! Cheyenne, what are you doing here? I had to talk to you. Uh, you shouldn't be here. I've got enough trouble. You didn't do those things to Adrian. Y... You d... You didn't do those things. Of course not. I knew she was making it up. I knew it. What is it, Cheyenne? Did Adrian ever tell you about a guy named Rick? Yeah, I think so. Said he was a friend. Why? He was our camp counselor. Adrian had a crush on him. So? He's dead. He ate something poisoned. Everyone thought it was an accident... b... but Adrian knows stuff, stuff that other kids don't know. She knows about wasps, too. I know. I thought about that. But there's just no proof. But I think there might be. Adrian kept a diary. She writes everything in it. She thinks no one knows about it, but I've seen it. She kept it hidden in her bedroom. I'll tell the lawyers about the diary, but... You got to forget all about Adrian. She's sick. You understand? Come on. You really shouldn't be here. She's a liar. She's lying about you. I know. But I can take care of myself. Come on. I'll walk you. I'll be all right. Done it a million times. Later. [ Piano plays ] NICK: Cheyenne! Cheyenne! [ Music box plays ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Ringing continues ] [ Telephone picks up ] So this is what it takes to finally get you up here. What are you doing? Fixing things. Where's Cheyenne? You want to do her, too? Is that it? I'm not good enough for you? Where is she, Adrian? I came back here for you, Nick. My parents tried to take me away, but I fooled them. Where is she? I came back here for you, and I found you with my best friend. I still love you, Nick! NICK: Cheyenne! Nick! Cheyenne! [ Screaming ] Nick! [ Screaming ] Accidents happen, Nick. I warned you. [ Sighs ] You know... In 10 years none of this would have mattered. I'd be 24. You'd be 38. It's so sad it had to end this way. What we had was so special... but... here we are. Too bad you didn't listen. I just want you to know, Nick... no matter what happens... we'll always be friends. Adrian! Adrian! [ Banging on door ] Adrian! Shit! Oh! Adrian! Adrian! God! Cheyenne! [ Grunts ] Ow! Cheyenne! Goddamn it! Adrian! Cheyenne! [ Door slams ] [ Giggling ] [ Laughing ] [ Calliope music starts to play ] Jesus! You okay? Hold on. [ Muffled scream ] [ Screaming ] I'm going to kill you! [ Continued screaming ] [ Grunting ] Adrian! [ Screaming ] Dad! [ Continued screaming ] Daddy, help me! I'll kill you! You... You son of a bitch! Leave him alone! [ Groans ] [ Coughing ] [ Screaming ] [ Birds singing ] So, there you are. It's quiet in here. Mm-hm. Another letter? Yeah. If only he'd let me apologize, I'd feel so much better. Hey, you've been making great progress. Concentrate on that. I just wish everyone was as... As understanding as you are. Well, they will be. It's just gonna take time for people to see that you've changed, okay? Mm-hm. DOCTOR: Well, you better get to class. And I'll see you in our session this afternoon. Okay. - DOCTOR: Bye-bye. - Bye. [ Camera clicks ] [ Laughs ] Sleepyhead missed the morning meeting. Shit! Oh, man! AMY: Don't worry, I told Michael you're on the trail of some big story. Thanks. Air mail. [ Laughs ]
