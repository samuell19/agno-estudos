This "extended version" of THE INVINCIBLES... ...has been restored on the basis of the original negative images. The additional added scenes were not part of the cinema version. The picture quality of these scenes is of lesser quality... ...as 35mm material no longer exists. However, they add to the originally intended version of the film. BAVARIA FILM presents THE INVINCIBLES Has she already seen the child? No. They didn't let her see the baby. Is she asleep? - Yes. The doctors are with her. They say that she's singing in her sleep. Because of the medication. I thought nothing could go wrong in our lives anymore. Come on, Heinz. It will be fine. It's not certain yet. Even though it's so beautiful outside. Shall I wait for you? - You don't have to. Thanks for driving me. Oh God! Nurse! Quick! Directed by Dominik Graf 52.000 spectators are in the stadium to watch this great match. AS Rome against Juventus Turin. The current score is 1:1... Two perpetrators. Both are armed. Are you there? Confirm that you're there. We are. Roger. Roger. The guests from the room next door are gone. That goes for 104 and 102. Roger. I can't see exactly, but I think one of the Italians is standing in front of the window. Those of us who are outside have to get out of sight, otherwise they'll realise. Once a goal is scored, the special forces will go in. The chambermaid thought it's weird that they're wearing gloves. 10 Deutschmarks that the next corner won't lead to a goal. Okay. 10 Deutschmarks against it. Silence from now on! Confirm! You owe me 60 now. You forgot the 200 that I lent you. Silence! Which 200? I've been in single service for eight years now. I promised myself to do something new every six years. My fiancée and I have been waiting for my transfer for three years now. I think that answers your question. Yes, I know what's ahead of us and no, I don't think it's too much of a burden. The next one, please. I do that quite often. That was almost a whole minute. I'm a practicing Christian. I neither eat animals, nor drink alcohol. I read the constitution. For me it says it all. The constitution and the New Testament are all I need. So I'm in? Great. He kicks... Goal! Police! Don't move! Freeze! Don't move! Get down! There was another one. Chase him! I'll check outside. They're inside. Stay downstairs! I'm inside 102. I'm in 104. I can see the window. It's open. Do we have units in the courtyard? Shut up! Shut up! Nobody's in the courtyard. Shut up! - What's going on? I think he left through the window. I'll go in now. Now! Nobody told us about three perpetrators. We only knew about two. You get me in there and he shoots me in the head? I wasn't covered. Who covered me? Now, one man could escape. My grandpa used to say: "Close, but no cigar". The guys regard the operation as a failure. Guys, leave us alone. - Okay. You too. Fine. How long will it take? I don't know. - Shall we leave everything as it is? Yes, that's fine. We'll get you back in later. Secretary of State Dessaul is the representative of the interior ministry. He knows about the matter. Thanks for your effort, gentlemen. Only policemen knew that I'd come to the room from downstairs. Do you know how precisely he opened the door with his foot? You should have seen how quick he did it! What should Karl have done? The other guy knew what he did. He wasn't just any old criminal, but trained and had an invented biography. Could you let him talk? I don't want to undermine your self-confidence. This is highly discrete: The man who fled really was an informant of my Office of Criminal Investigation unit. I asked him to buy a large amount of forged money from the arrested. When we were sure that the deal would take place here today, I requested you. How high is the amount of seized, forged money? 25 million. Why didn't you tell us about the informant beforehand, Mr. Erlsberg? Operations of this kind... - This could have gone out of control. Not to mention the danger you put your own man in. Done? I always treat operations like this secretly, as information might leak otherwise. My man was responsible for his own safety. He had to knock you down. Otherwise his cover would have been blown. I'm sorry. I don't have a problem with that. I'm simply doing my job. And I'm good at it. Nobody doubts that. - What's the real name of your informant? I don't want to talk about this sensitive subject. I just explained that to you. They're not asking for fun. - Mr. Erlsberg! Chief Inspector Karl Simon thinks the informant was a former colleague. He worked with him for the special forces from 1984-1989. Who is that supposed to be? The man who knocked me out was Heinz Schaefer. But he died four years ago. He committed suicide. After he had killed his two days old child in hospital. I was there back then. In front of the hospital. I drove him there. We were friends. I had no idea. A few days later his motorcycle was found in Cologne under a Rhine bridge. A week later he was washed ashore and found at Baumberg. That's where all the water corpses are washed ashore. The body got into a propeller. Can anybody in this room confirm that observation? You couldn't have found anyone better than one of us. To subvert the organized scene. Do you really think the Office of Criminal Investigation would... ...work with someone like the person you described? A child murderer? My informant isn't dead and his name has never been Schaefer. I know my informant's biography, but of course I won't tell you. Mr. Simon, are you saying that you don't trust the body of the state of law? I think you're just looking for an excuse for your failure. Mr. Thingy, Mr. Erlsberg, I don't care what you think. Informants who committed crimes? - Who still commit crimes? Who enrich themselves on their duty? - That doesn't exist. That couldn't happen in a state of law. Exactly! - Exactly! What about the money? What kind of group has an informant? More than our A-9? Can you imagine what must have happened four years ago? That's the worst. I don't even know what to imagine. Did he want to kill himself? Was he pressurised after the hospital? Bernd! Bernd! I never really got to know Heinz. You know that him and you were in a different group. You know how he looked! You were the first one in the room this afternoon. I can only see one guy still standing in front of me. With a hole in his throat. What? What did he say? - Calm down! Don't show off! You can be pissed off about your jobs when you're on patrol in a few years. When you earn 3,300 Deutschmarks a month to stand at squares saying: Your driver licence, please. I'm going to buy a dog. I promised my kids a dog. I want to die in my own bed. Does this make sense? Five years. Here! Three! I know what I saw. They get that in writing. - No! You never managed... - No one does that to me... ...claim that I cover my fail by opening a colleague's grave. I'm going to... Even if he died three times... - You can't control it. Let it be, Karl. That's why they didn't find the head. Are you kidding me? The eels? You know... At Leverkusen... The thin acid corroded him. All of this makes no sense. Five fucking, lick my years... - Dude, stop! Yes! Yes! Yes! - Stop that! Yes! Yes! Yes! - Stop that! Stop! Shit! Come on, let's go! Damn, he cut right into it! Stop it! Don't move! Get a doctor! You are a Santa Claus! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it! You're some Santa Claus! What are you doing? ONLY FOR OFFICIAL USE Is there a copy at the department? Not anymore. I can't allow an investigation take place in this case. Mr. Dessaul! Your dog is destroying our garden. Down! Down! Why did I have to force you to give me this story? Correct me if I'm wrong, but why would I have never found out... ...if not some policeman had recognised him? Why would I, as your superior would never have seen this? It's just a question. My superior is the head of the Office of Criminal Investigation. He doesn't know and I wouldn't have shown him this. Not so loud, please! My wife is at home. If I understand this correctly, you got Schaefer out of business four years ago. He faced his department after killing his child... ...and really wanted to kill himself after a few days. We kind of arranged that for him, Holger. What this says... What Schaefer did will blow up half the government. That's the decisive part. I know. But he'll keep a low profile. Besides us, nobody knows that he exists. They cut off the head of another drowning. In hospitals they often do that for teaching purposes. What's that? Are you injured? Don't make a fuss. Where is the dog? Bootsmann! Bootsmann! What is he talking about? He wants to buy a dog for the boys and call it Bootsmann. One should get a dog in springtime, Karl. Alright, in springtime then. - Exactly. You've become so fat! He's as heavy as bells. There are snails under my bed. Snails? Come on, Basti! There are no snails under your bed. Go back to sleep. Mum will come soon. Lothar? I have to call Anja. Otherwise she'll think I won't come home. Go to bed as well. Whoever is fulfilled with love is impotent. Easy for you to say. You have no family. That's good. I thank God every day. Did something happen on duty? Are you allowed to tell me? Karl thinks he saw Heinz Schaefer who died four years ago. Because of his daughter, right? She was... - ...mentally disabled. He hit her like farmers beat cats to death. Maybe in your Sauerland. In Elspe. Bernd is drunk as well. He got a bird from a tree today. He doesn't remember its name. I haven't had such a great birthday in a long time. Where are the snails? What had happened to Heinz Schäfer's daughter? Where are the snails? - She got too little oxygen during birth. The umbilical cord was around her throat. I can't see no one. I am Simon the explorer. Yes. - Yes. I'm the indestructible explorer. Yes. - Yes. What was his wife's name again? The blond one? She wasn't from here. No, she was from... - Angelika. No, her husband called her differently. Sunny. Nothing's changed. There are new lamps in the kitchen. Do you still work in the haulage firm at Freilingrath? Yes. You look tired, Sunny. Why didn't you show up anymore? I think the time was over, right? Or not? Aren't you together with a new guy? No. When he was still here, it looked differently. Something was always lying around. Heinz couldn't even make a sandwich without letting something lie around. The bread, the knife... I completely forgot her name. Could you stay with me for a night again? Back then you were... One thought that if the wind blew through the house, it would take you along. You have dry hands. I've known you for longer than Heinz. Do you know how I came from Berlin? I was a waitress in Conti's ice cream parlour. He comes to me every night. In my dreams. He holds me. But the way they found him. He has no... ...head anymore. The propeller. I know why you had sex with me back then. Couldn't you do that again? Out of pity? Help me! You can't mourn your husband for the rest of your life. But I love him. More than anything in the world. HQ, please answer! Here's HQ. I can hear you. I found the colleague. So? It was nothing. She has no idea. She thinks he's dead. Come on, let's leave, Hannes. I won't go crazy over this. Where are you now? Airport tunnel. The minister landed late. Hurry up and get him here. We can only enter the hotel through the backdoor. There are about 200 demonstrators. Tell the grieving group over there. Come on! Overtake us. There's a group of demonstrators in front of the hotel. I thought the meeting is secret. It leaked! Guys, I promised my wife to have a nice day. Television stations are already there. - Awesome, will I be on TV? Maybe they need a riot for their ratings. We have to go to the backdoor with the minister. After the surprising decision to close the Rhenus steelworks... ...2,000 people are afraid for their job. Many came here to demonstrate against losing their jobs. Against losing their jobs and against Interior Minister Reinhard Hilferding. He just arrived. The hotel management wants to tell you... ...that your stay on the premises is trespassing. Hilferding, you sod! Come here! It's your fault! I won't let you say that! We can talk about everything, but not like this. Why did we even vote for you assholes? I made the heads relent! Nobody's listening to you, you fraud! Otherwise all of you would be unemployed now. I want to talk to the people! - Sure, but it's a bad day for that, minister! Imagine what would happen if the six of us marched to the executive floor? That'd be the end of champagne and celebrations. The colloquial language would return to politics. I can promise you that. You can be sure of that. The people here feel like they were deceived for a long time. How can I get the salmonella out of here? You'll get a new one. - I have a second suit in my car outside. That's not what this is about. I have a second suit in my car as well. Dessaul. Nice to meet you. We know each other from the operation in Graf Adorf Hotel last week, right? As good as new. You wrote a report, right? Right. Absolutely. But there were no more clues about your claim, as the dead colleague... No. At least I didn't find out anything. You mustn't be shocked now, Sunny. No. When you're shocked, the glass breaks. I'm back. I've returned to you. Yes, I know. You come quite often and talk to me. You say that it's my fault. That it's my fault that you're gone and she's dead. I'm still working for the police. But undercover. Do you understand? It would have gone on for longer, but Karl Simon recognised me. My cover is blown. - Yes, he was here and asked questions. You really are here! I always watched you. When you went home from Freilingrath. You still walk too fast. You don't look at other men. I never thought you'd stay faithful. Even after death. Now I'm back. No! You can't just return. That's worse than all the dreams. Do you know how often I thought you're in the house and I talked to you? I knew that something was wrong. If this isn't a dream, I'm crazy. Leave! Get out of my life! They covered me back then, invented the suicide... I wasn't allowed to see you during these four years. When it comes to what I did... ...you would have been in danger. I went to your grave, Heinz. I called out: Give me back my peace! Let me go, Heinz! You can't come back now. Special forces, answer! Yes, Roger. Is the meeting over already? Seems like it. Most of them are in the disco. Where's the minister? On the upper level, where the special forces are. They'll stay over night. The man kept an account. Why are you surprised? He's an official. Sure. Shit! He was recognised at an operation. By a former colleague. Really? Two years ago I thought about buying a plane for that money. A white one for sure. A white plane like the pope's. Extinguish the fires! We're asking for your understanding. Cabbage Roll, baking politics chicks! I'm with the crocodiles. Three seven. Come on, Holger! You don't want all of us to lose our jobs! Six people from all the big parties. I have to protect myself. How much time have I got? We have to inform the others, talk about the timing... ...and who leaves when for which official reason. It mustn't be noticeable, right? Two months? Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt... ...but we got information about a conspicuous object in the room. Please go to the lobby for now and stay calm! No reason to panic. We'll take care of the object. My colleagues will get you out. That way out! Last week we had the same spectacle. Shake it! Could you please leave? What are you doing with my dinner? Why are you staring like that? There are cultures in which women are a normal part of the streetscape. What are you? Federal Border Police? Special forces? Incognito. What's your plan for tonight, Mrs... Miss Saide. Pleasure. I know you mustn't tell your identity. But when ministers and so many state secretaries are here... ...the house is full of special forces. Do you know Mr. Dessaul? Close? How close? He doesn't let people take pictures of him from the side. He thinks his profile isn't dominant enough. You're as shy as all the virgins. I can see that. Second decade? French ancestry. Your mother. They checked on us, Melba. That's the whole secret. They asked for our names at reception and asked for the particulars by radio. They're doing all of this because of us. Would you introduce yourselves now? May I introduce you, Miss Dessaul, to: The "Pea Roller"! "Thunderhip"! "Happy when glass in hand". And I'm: "Wind in the ears". Be careful. Laughing makes you fall in love. Toy department... Peace, brother. - Peace! The lorry-driver fell asleep! Error. What's your job, Mrs. Dessaul? - Didn't the computer say? No. - Prestige advisor, so to say. I have an ad agency that shapes a party's image. Which party? - The one of my husband. So? How are the chances? If elections really could change anything, they'd be forbidden. We'll go and catch salmons. Catch salmons! Why are you doing this? My husband's sleeping in there and I wanted you to keep me in good memory. Goodnight. The sun made a great step. The stars screamed: We want to come along! The sun ranted: You'll stay at home! Otherwise I'll burn out your golden eyes! During the fiery ride. - During the fiery ride around the world. The stars went to the moon and screamed: Let's move with you. And you, dear moon, with your shine, won't burn out our eyes. And the moon took them along into the night. You have to say: All kids fall asleep! And scatter dust. All kids fall asleep. But we don't yet, as he didn't get us. And the sandman met his friend, the wind. And with it he flew to earth. They visited all children and put all of them to bed. Sleep well, all children. Have nice dreams and let the angels sing in them. My son will perform again. The sandman. Did you come to talk to me about Heinz? You think he's a bad person, right? He surely thought... What did it get out of life? The creature that didn't know it existed. That couldn't recognise mum and dad. That's no reason to beat it to death like a farmer. I didn't know you're Catholic. We didn't find a place in other kindergartens. Who has the most beautiful sheep? The golden moon! What do you want? Help? Does Heinz want to meet me? I want to make it easier for you to put the past to rest. The police was at my home today. They were looking for Heinz, just like you. They talked about you. They didn't find anything. Tell Heinz to hand himself in. Otherwise I'll find him. Thanks. You're welcome. See you! Stop it with your suspicions, Karl. The wild farmer killed himself. I identified the corpse. Here, look at this! Goose liver! Goose liver! I can see that it's your day off today. It's my son's birthday. - Nice, how old? Four. I found this in the wardrobe. It's a sensation! Poultry! Guys, poultry! No mercy! No mercy! No mercy, the "Cabbage Roll"! LUCKY GOOSE Uli, wouldn't a fledgling have sufficed? Yes, who wants to do great things in Love, whose body has to be prepared for it. The negro kills the rhino, to take away its nose. He turns it into erotic powder and then waits for ecstasy. You're more stupid than a pack of cucumbers. Norbert! Yes, I heard what you said. I asked for an investigation on Heinz. I wrote a report. We investigated in Schaefer's house. - I know. No results. I understand that his wife tried to bribe you. I want to start the early review now. The groups are waiting. I don't want to drag anyone into this. Not even you. But I want to know the path that Heinz took. Why? What do you do to us, that all of us work the same? On, off, on, off, on, off, on. If I keep getting the impression that you're mentally fragile... ...there will be consequences for you, Karl. I wouldn't even say that to another one of you. I normally just watch them go crazy and suddenly they're gone. The end. Over! Morning! - Morning. Morning! Alright. Before you'll find out somewhere else: The State office head of department Erlsberg was shot... ...in Dusseldorf by an unknown killer last night. The interior ministry imposed a news blackout for the murder. We only tell you because some of you had to do with him last week. It supposedly was revenge by the organised crime. Erlsberg came on strong against them. The bad money operation in the Graf Adorf Hotel probably got him on the death list. But of course nobody wants to say that at a news conference. We mustn't tell you more at the moment. My colleague Klaus will talk about the roster with you. Ringringring, the birthday mail is here. Who wants to go to Africa? We don't want to travel on our own, we take Basti with us. Basti! Basti! Are you my dad? - Basti, no I'm not your dad. When will dad come? - Basti, dad will come later. Bye, Michaela. - Bye. At the moment a painting by him costs 50,000 pounds at Christie's. He's in Königsfelden psychiatry, near Zurich. He's 68 and still waits to be drafted into military. Everyone can do as one pleases. You wanted to talk? Talk. How is your companion doing? Saide? Well. Which part does she play? Do you know what a Cicisbeo is? She's the beloved of my husband. I picked her for him. He accepted it? - I got her into the marital bed. She stayed there. My husband isn't great when it comes to sexual matters. He's the kind of lover who has fun... ...trying to give the first orgasm to uptight young ladies. But... ...I don't want to lose him. I know where I belong. When I'm in deep water. Do you even pay Saide? Indirectly. You're very frank. I try not to lie when I want to be with a man. I know that my life is too short to waste it with things I don't like. You have to take me. Otherwise I don't get anything out of it. I didn't plan to make our lives more complicated than they are. My life isn't too complicated. I didn't want to disappoint you. But you're currently my only chance to find out the truth. The best way to protect you from personal crises is a full diary. Today is my son's birthday. - Really? You're making a fist. You'll hurt yourself. I got in touch with you because... ...I'd like to talk to your husband. I'm not his reception. - I know. Don't misunderstand me. A member of the Office of Criminal Investigations... ...was shot in this city last night. His name is Georg Erlsberg. If your husband and Mr. Erlsberg were that good of friends... ...as I assume according to what I saw... ...it would be important for me to talk to him. I think you're exceeding your competence. I don't even know your name. How about you use the official channel next time? That's what you call it, right? - Yes. Sure, I know. In that case I'd ask you to leave now. I'd like an answer, Mrs. Dessaul. Do you know Erlsberg? I'll ask my husband whether I'm allowed to answer you. Yes... Please do so. The murder... I just told you an official secret. Don't tell anyone. - Stop joking and leave! I won't lead you to the door. I think we should never go to any doors together again. Have a nice evening. What is it? Are you scared? Holger, what's wrong? What are you scared of? It's the red wine. You know the reason for everything, right? Don't walk around barefooted. You're esteemed, Holger. You're in the public's good books. Talk to me, what's wrong? I asked for a report about an informant of the Office of Criminal Investigation. They say that six well known politicians got a lot of money two years ago. From the area of organised crime. The informant was the money courier. We even have account statements. For what? What? - What did they get the money for? Those six blocked a draft law two years ago. It was about a bank that was thought to launder drug money. Some of the politicians were in the bank's supervisory committee. Six people earned very well. For half a year they earned very well. And why not? You covered that back then? - No, I didn't know it. The official who gave me the information was shot last night. I underestimated it. They stick together. Is Hilferding one of them? Are you afraid of your position if he leaves? What would you know? Holger! Did you try to blackmail someone? Tell me! No! Where's the evidence? With my lawyer. Which isn't save enough anymore. You understand? If I lose the evidence... Suddenly it's very quiet here. The phone isn't ringing anymore. This is too much. This really is too much. Go to sleep. We'll talk tomorrow. Show me! You aren't really with me! - It's fine, Holger. You're injured. That's blood. Mum! Mum! Hold me! It's fine. I closed the windows. You got to know somebody, right? When you're in a relationship for so long, you know too much about each other. But maybe it isn't true. It isn't. Basti? I thought you closed the windows. What is it? Basti? Basti? - Karl! Karl! He's still in the house. Lothar! - Be quiet! We won't go to bed yet? Stay there! Stay there! Stop! Never get in my way again, Karl. Get transferred. Far away from me. Forever. Karl! Who is the insured? - Me, the mother. What's your name? - Annalena Becker. You can't come along. - Of course I can! He's my son! Annalena is one word. Excuse me? This can't be true! I don't have to tell you. I want to get to my son in there! You won't come in here! - I will! Not without your ID. - I will! No one can join the examination. What's going on? Could you please tell us what's going on? We're trying to lower the fever. How did he get insulin? Is anyone in your family diabetic? No. - No, why? Your son has a low dose of insulin in his blood. If you wait for 30 minutes, you can take him home again. Is that spot vacant? Dad! Sit next to me! The phone was occupied. Immo is waiting at the train station for you, anyway. He'll take you to Irene. That's mum's friend. - Can we play now? We won't eat enough here. We'll play in the compartment. Nonsense! Could we have two coffees and two sausages? Spaghetti! Spaghetti! Spaghetti! - We've no Spaghetti left. Asshole! - Pull yourself together! Two sausages. But the bee won't sting again. A wasp stung you. A wasp doesn't always sting when it comes. They only sting when they're scared. Like bees. When you're in love, you can even hold bees in your hands. And then close your hands. And the bee won't sting. But you have to truly be in love. Dear travelers, we'll reach Koblenz in a few minutes, at 11:37 pm. You can take the next train to Bingen at 11:52 pm, platform 3. For information about other trains, please read our intercity information. I have to get out at the next station. Yes. All the shutters are closed. - Good. Clear! Clear! Why did you report the crime with a fake name? Otherwise I'll get security vacation. - So what? What's so bad about three weeks of rest? The rest will come soon enough. I'll be a normal patrol cop on the market square. Checking tyres. Hello, vehicle inspection. Nothing's forever, right? - I can't imagine an end for me here. And... Nothing that I can't imagine can happen. Not even dying? - I can imagine that. The head understands that faster than the bones and the organs. Like with my father... I sat by his bed while he died for three days. He had his mouth open. The lips dry out, so you have to wet them constantly. It took so long. His heart was so strong. Do you know what he said when he died? He listened to music. Don't you already think about stopping? Are you still with us? With all your heart? Sure. Sure. Calm down! I do calm down. When somebody sits on my face. Now! Hit me in the face, Norbert. - Is he mad? I can stand it! Hit me in the face! I'm just as much of an asshole as Heinz. A stupid special forces sod. Hit me! Last night, Schaefer, who doesn't exist, attacked my family. Explain this: The water corpse got into my child's room and gave Basti a syringe? Did you know? No? Hit me again. Maybe then I'll understand. What about your boy? Everything we say is being hushed up. What happened here over four years is being hushed up, right? Right? I don't get anything out of it! - I gave everything to the top. The reports... - Not far enough up. Where our dear God lives. Don't hit him in the face! In two days all the shitty lies will go public. And I'll get Heinz! I promise! Otherwise this will happen again! And never forget that your own people can hurt you badly! Good morning. - Good morning, Mrs. Dessaul. Good morning. You already have a visitor. Really? - Yes, we couldn't get rid of him. Who is it? - He said: "A man you know very well". But you don't know his name. - Really? Sounds interesting. We thought so, too. Shall I let them get us some hot water? To pour in some more? To stay fit. I had to convince your anteroom to let me in. So I'm a surprise for you. What do you want to ask me today? When can I talk to your husband? My husband's on a journey. - Until tonight? Why? I'm on duty tonight in the conference centre at the Rhine Stadium. Your husband's on the guest list. Yes, that's right, but I don't know whether he'll be there. Will you be there? Yes. Did you talk to him? No. He's on a journey. You did talk to him. No. At least not about you. Not about me? Not about us? You draw a line between your life and me? Don't you? - I do! I don't like it. Not this morning. - Is your life complicated now? I don't think everything you imagine has to become reality. Still... Did you know that I'd come back? Desire is a dog that keeps running after you. No! That you're here... How much time have we got? - One hour. And just for once. - Don't you want to lock the door? Push that button! You're scaring me! Do you like that? - Yes! What about your hour? It'll soon be over. That makes what humans built even more admirable. Downstairs, everything is full with their limousines. We have to organise this differently next time. Nobody can get through. We're coming to the Rhine Stadium. Car two for one. Answer! Roger. We're driving to the underpass with all the chauffeurs. Stay ready! What did he say? - We can't park upstairs. It's full. One, please! - Yes? The minister arrived. Roger. My lawyer informed me. His office was burgled last night. The files of the Office of Criminal Investigations are gone. Yes? I have to talk to Mr. Dessaul. Holger Dessaul. It's about a file. He knows about it. Wait, I'll try to contact him. Wait a sec. An important call on Mr. Dessaul's car telephone. Look whether you can find him. I've made a mistake. I won't keep pressurising you, von Graichen, Struthmann and the others. Why? It's new that you don't say what you think. Or that you don't mean what you said. I've made a mistake. Mr. Dessaul! Someone called your car phone. I think it's important. We're coming outside. Alright. I'll come along. I want to talk to him. You expected a call? - Yes, from my lawyer. He confirmed it. Mr. Dessaul, I'd like to talk to you alone. Not tonight. When? I have an office. Call it and get an appointment. You were on a journey for two days. Why do you think so? - I heard that. Nonsense! If we stay up until six, can I sleep at yours? Yes. I can get something to eat there, right? - Shall I also dance for you? That'd be nice. Throw the radio away! Throw the radio away! Keep going! Keep going! Take away his gun! Go! I didn't hear anything. There was a message. Where are the colleagues with Dessaul? Keep your hands up! I think they're in the underpass. Everything was fine. I told you to keep your hands up! There was a shot in the underpass! Get down on the ground! Put your shoulder to the left! Here's the special squad! Repeat! Get in! Faster! An attempted kidnapping. Three perpetrators, one car. In the underpass. I'll try to follow. I repeat: I'll try to follow. They have to get past the stadium upstairs. Special squad! Answer! Special forces are coming. We're on our way. I can see the two cars from here. The chauffeur's driving parallel. The others are driving against the driving direction. What's that maniac doing? Dear God! My legs! My legs! Shit! Shut up! Take cover! What are they doing? - They're shooting around! They're leaving through the roof. Take cover! Down there! Faster! Get out! The second car! Where is the second car? Turn around! I don't have a gun! - Catch! Stay down! Come on, drive the car here. Go! They have a second car over there. With another guy in it. Silence! Stay away! I'll blow him up! I promise I'll blow him up! He has a bomb. Leave! Hannes is being threatened by a bomb. Don't put your finger away! Go! Get in! Now! Go! Go! - Go! The bomb! Ollie! Step on it! Go! Gun down! Ollie! They're gone. Ollie is dead. Ollie Kaul is dead. Why didn't you give the "Go"? - I'd love to know as well. The situation was obvious. The guns were always ready to shoot at both hostages. Nonsense, Karl! There was a moment when it would have worked out. I stood behind you. The perpetrator pushed the first hostage into the car. Why didn't you shoot then? Another mistake? As in the Graf Adorf two weeks ago? The perpetrator walked to the second car. Backwards. The second hostage... - It's Hannes. Our drinking Hannes. "Thunderhip". He has a name. - I know that! I know! Hannes was threatened by the second perpetrator's bomb. I told you via radio. I don't think Olli had the right to give the Go. I don't think we should jump to conclusions, Karl. The way the kidnapping took place allows the conclusion... ...that the perpetrators have one or more accomplices amongst you. When reconstructing what took place on the parking spot tonight... ...one realises that you had the chance to give the "Go". Why didn't you? First of all, I was too far away. - Why? You have good eyes. Secondly, Hannes Grigull was threatened with a bomb. Third of all I was irritated by the fact that I recognised one of the perpetrators. It was Heinz Schaefer. The former colleague who supposedly committed suicide four years ago. There's one thing I have to say: The assumption that this questioning is based on, is an insult. I've been working for the special forces for twelve years. ...in this unit for three years. - Mr. Helmer! Tell us about the operation on the 24th of August in the Graf Adorf Hotel. Mr. Falk! Have you ever been offered participating in criminal activities... ...from members of the group or non-members? Repeat that, please. Mr. Mannheimer, do you know the secret number of Mr. Dessaul's official car? 0171... 1579462. Do you know why we're asking you question? I guess the call that lured Mr. Dessaul out of the hall, was from the kidnappers. It certainly wasn't from Mr. Dessaul's lawyer. Someone from Mr. Dessaul's environment must have given the number away. Or a member of your group. The secret number was changed two days ago. It was on your duty plan since yesterday. I didn't recognise the perpetrators. Shit! Okay. Maybe I saw Schaefer once or twice in my life. But with that lighting, at that distance I hadn't even... ...been able to recognise my own father, with that balaclava. I don't know, why Karl Simon thinks so. I don't. How did you recognise the perpetrator from a thirty to forty metre distance? He was hooded. His movements and eyes. After working together for five years, you can identify a man in your sleep. The way he holds a gun, or a cigarette. Hannes Grigull can confirm Schaefer's existence. He must have recognised him in the first getaway car. Mr. Grigull can't be questioned yet. The kidnappers want me to tell you this: I'm fine according to circumstances. There is no immediate reason to be worried. The ransom demand is, due to my family's assets, nine million Deutschmarks. I repeat: Nine million. Otherwise I'll be executed. Melba, I love you. To identify me, I shall say something that only you know about me. What happened? What is it? Can I help you? When our Irish Setter died two years ago, you replaced... ...his basket with a vase, so the spot wouldn't be so empty. We'll call again. Mr. Simon! We had the opportunity to check your statements over night. About the Graf Adorf Hotel, the attack on your child and tonight. The key to your story about the dead informant Heinz Schaefer... ...seems to be his wife, Angelika Schaefer. I guess she already left the country. In a foreign country, you think? If I were Schaefer, I'd have sent her on a journey. Mrs. Schaefer, please take a seat. Can you recognise one of the voices on this tape? No. When did Mr. Simon visit you for the first time this summer? On the 25th of August. I got back from work. That was the day after the operation in the Graf Adorf Hotel. He asked me whether I'd be ready to claim that my husband was still alive. What? Wait! We already know what you said happened. Keep going. I didn't understand. My husband died tragically back then... I loved my husband and... But more than a week later, I think it was the fifth... ...he ordered me to come to the kindergarten. You went there? - He said it's important. What happened there? There was a performance with children on stage. His son performed there. It was loud and we went into a corner. That's true. He then gave me the envelope with money. Maybe a few thousand Marks. I didn't see it too well. He once again asked me to tell the police that my husband... ...was alive and that I'm in contact with him. I refused. I gave back the money. And then? I went home. You haven't had contact since then? No. Thanks, Mrs. Schaefer. Thanks for your testimony. You can leave now. Sunny? Who will take care of her grave when you two leave the country? If she had survived, I probably would have bought her a bird couple. Little budgies in green, with red beaks. You always buy two... - Lovebirds. For whom had you bought them? I had a daughter. Katrin. She'd be four now. Do you know this envelope? Sunny gave me a similar one. - In kindergarten? Do you know what's in it? About 2,000 Deutschmarks. - 20,000 Deutschmarks. Notes that are registered by the Office of Criminal Investigations. You want to know where we found them? - Yes. In the basement of your house. Tonight, while we searched it. How did you get the money of the Office of Criminal Investigations? And where's the rest? - What rest? Your fingerprints are on it. - What? Your fingerprints are on it. Simon, you're in deep trouble. - Of course they are, if this is the envelope. If I wanted to bribe the woman, I wouldn't keep the envelope in my house. The phantom of her husband deposited it at yours? I don't know why Schaefer hates me so much. The night before last night he attacked my child. He must have placed the envelope there then. Sure. We'll get to that. This money got lost at an operation in the Graf Adorf Hotel, four weeks ago. So far we assumed that the agent who was supposed to buy the money... ...ran away with it. - Mr. Schaefer? We don't know a Schaefer. The informant is called Ralph Hürten. He was a member of Erlsberg's department. Of course. You got him a perfect new identity. And everything else you just... - We have a different theory. You let Hürten escape from the hotel with the money. You two had that planned. With the money you planned the kidnapping of Mr. Dessaul and prepared the details. To cover your accomplices, like Hürten... ...you made up that crazy story of the resurrected Heinz Schaefer. He threw himself into the Rhine four years ago in Leverkusen. Clever as you are, you used the fact that his head was never found. My son was attacked two days ago. - You didn't report that. I didn't want to be given leave. Because you hadn't been here for the kidnapping tonight. Any other man in your position would've killed the kidnapper. You have no idea about that. Attacking your child was an attempt to make your Schaefer story more believable. After Mrs. Schaefer didn't want to help you. What happened to your son? Nothing! You said it yourself. The hospital confirmed that. The dosage was well calculated. That was a distraction. I'm the only one who knows that he's alive. He attacked my child to make me believe that I'm in danger. At the same time he put the money in my basement. To make me unreliable. Do you think I did that myself? You used others for the execution. Mr. Simon! Your contradicting testimonies make us assume... ...that you participated in kidnapping Mr. Dessaul. Your boss's pleading's the only reason that no legal steps were taken against you so far. You and your whole group are suspended from now on! You mustn't leave Dusseldorf until the regulation is abolished. The ministry imposed a news blackout on the kidnapping of Mr. Dessaul. Contact to journalists or other people of the public is forbidden. Of course everything we talked about is an official secret. Yes! I talked to Dr. Soussan. Mr. Grigull will keep the hearing damage. The doctor said he'll keep a blast injury. How bad? He'll always hear this tone. The piping. For the rest of his life. He can wear a deaf aid, so he can hear sounds and talks. Does he know that? - Yes. Did you take care of the decoration in there? Yes. You did a good job. The bomb! Karl? Karl? Hey! If he survives, I'll kill him. That sod! If anybody finds out anything we'll talk about now... I'll put it differently. If one of you doesn't want to hear this, leave now. Not any later. From now on we can do it together, or not at all. We have to find out the truth. One of us is an accomplice of the kidnapper. We can agree on that. Yes. First I want to know, whether one of us is an informer of the bosses. Stop that. Forget it. That doesn't count anymore. If you send everyone out who's tasked to observe you, you'll be alone. That's not the point, Ulli. - Why not? The point is that Karl is right. - Why should Karl be right? Hannes must have waited for the second perpetrator at the escalator. Otherwise he would have turned around earlier. And Karl would have reacted sooner. I saw the same thing that you did. Hannes went to the ground. No! He didn't. But he should have! Mum and Irene are shopping. They promised to get batteries for the electro... Stop it! - What are you doing? Basti is trying to hit me with the harmonica. Now he's getting the broom. Don't hit each other! - He can't. He's too small. I'm not small! Immo said I saved 65 Deutschmarks. How much do you have? You can't even count, you narcoleptic. 65, lalala. 65, lalala. Is mum crying? - No. She is. She is. She is. That's not true! Ladies and Gentlemen, you know who's talking. If you hear this, you and the minister are sitting together, scared. Worrying that our business will be made public by me. That won't happen. We have the same goals. When did you get the tape? - Two hours ago. As I already told the minister, I freed you from the person who... ...poses the biggest problem for me and you. Don't forget that I was trained not to be defeated. I'll use my means now. Mr. von Graichen, Minister Hilferding, you earned a lot through me. Now I'll earn money and you won't say a word. Since I was recognised, Germany has become dangerous for me. My leader, Erlsberg, knew that and wanted to put me off. To protect myself from revenge, I'll return to the realm of dead. I won't be alone on my way there. You can prepare your black suits. Yes? Sorry. I bet you want to see Hannes Grigull, right? He's gone. He left. He just left. - He simply left. This morning. - This morning. Karl! Karl! I thought we'd meet in Hannes's room? Why are you on your own? Why shouldn't I come on my own? The others are supposed to keep an eye on you. What didn't you tell me? Why did Grigull run away from hospital? Why didn't I give the "Go"? To prevent what happened. You remember? We once went over what happens if the hostage is the perpetrator's accomplice. When the hostage only acts like a hostage... ...there's no possibility for an access. But the hearing trauma was real. Let's think about what you can do with a hearing trauma. I can pull a trigger, drive a car, accept my share of the money... I can have a flight booked for me. That's a good start. How would you know that Grigull was one of them? Norbert, you know that they'll send us on patrol duty. What's your plan? We'll find out where he'll get the money. That's easy. We're involved. You can report us or cover us. It doesn't matter anymore. You'll stay right where you are! Yes. Yes, 5082. Will you open? Come on! Quicker! In two days, we'll be in Angra dos Reis, watching the sunset. In three weeks, we'll have forgotten who we were. Am I too loud? I don't think Sunny will like this. What? Flying on her own. In the case of the kidnapping of undersecretary Holger Dessaul... ...the crisis committee of Dusseldorf's police and minister Reinhard Hilferding... ...reminded the press about the news blackout, this morning. It was confirmed that the negotiations with the kidnappers... ...leave hope for a peaceful end of the kidnapping. We have no information about the demands of the perpetrators. Minister Hilferding denied a connection between the kidnapping... ...of Holger Dessaul and his job in the investigation committee... ...of the government that's working against organised crime. Gentlemen! This morning, you'll accompany Mrs. Dessaul on her train ride to Munich. Yesterday, we got a letter that demands... ...the money being handed over in Munich's city centre. The kidnapper will probably only contact her at Munich central station. He'll probably try to stop preventive measures by the special forces. In the package with the letter, there was a red coat and a yellow bag. That way, the kidnapper will be able to recognise Mrs. Dessaul. To prevent all risks, the government will expect all officials to follow all orders. The hostage's life has top priority. A message for Mrs. Dessaul has already been left at Hotel Königshof. She should wait in a pub in the city centre. It's called "Wine cellar at the cathedral". Was she already told that? Yes, she knows that. She should leave her friend now. Does she know the way to the wine cellar? We showed it to her on the map. The city centre isn't blocked by us. That'd be too conspicuous. We'll just keep watching. She has to walk through the whole pedestrian area. We'll take over from the exit onwards. Bye, colleagues from Dusseldorf. Have a good journey home. We have two watchdogs. One is with her and splits up with her at Ettstreet. Yes. We can already see her coming. It's hard to overlook that woman. - That's the whole point. She only has two people left around her. We'll let her walk through Cathedral lane on her own. It's too open there. Roger. We have seven people in the wine cellar. It's always half empty at this time. They haven't noticed anything. She's walking down the lane. She found it. Is this yours? Yes. - A man gave it to me. She has contact to a little girl. She's giving her something made of silver. A box or case. Describe her! - Ten or eleven years old. Long black hair. She's running away. Catch her! Catch her! Catch her! 1. INTO YOUR EAR 2. SWITCH ON Bonjour, Madame. I hope you had a good journey. And I hope you can understand me well. I'll be your companion on your way, Mrs. Dessaul. First we'll get rid of your followers. Just keep going until I tell you something else, okay? Stay calm. You don't have to be worried. Did you see the café you just passed? Turn around and go back. Go into the café. There are stairs to the toilet at the back left. Go there! But you mustn't be shocked. You'll see your mirror image soon. Stay calm and keep going. Don't let anyone recognise anything. She went to the toilet. Maybe there's another exit. She's coming back. She's leaving towards Theatinerstreet. We did a good job. Take off your coat and leave the café. She's coming towards us. Go back to Theatinerstreet. Everyone at Prielmayerstreet, go back to Captainhall. Roger. Nobody said anything about running. Stay calm! Who's running? We only have three people in the throughway. She has to stay with her! She looks like her friend from the central station. Now you're heading onto the street. Please get in, Mrs. Dessaul. Put the bag in the back. Get in! Who's that? Get lost! - Are you alone or is anyone watching us? I'm alone. In that case, drive! There was a woman with a yellow bag at Prielmayerstreet. She was pushed into a car. What? She's in Theatinerstreet. - She didn't wear a red coat. Registration number? - M-FX-8800. Black Mercedes. She's with us. We'll follow her into the passage. I'm warning you, Karl! If anything goes wrong because of you, I'll make your life a living hell. Trust me! Trust me for once. It looks as if she got an instruction. She went behind a pillar. - What about the Mercedes? We can see her in the shopping passage. We'll keep our distance and wait. She's behind the pillar. Where are you going? I only know that I have to get on the motorway to Garmisch. In 20 minutes I'll get a call. There's a coat for the woman. Where are you going that it's so cold? It's padded. It's great when you can finally let yourself go, right? It has to be tough to always contain yourself. The trust in people like you mustn't be damaged even more, right? I want to ask a question. Aren't you scared that I could identify you later? I know you think I failed, because I didn't protect your husband. But that's not true. I couldn't give the command, because the other hostage was one of the kidnappers. You can't cause anything, but a catastrophe then. You risk my husband, the handover and everything! Do you think I'm crazy? I know what I'm doing. You don't have to worry. Why didn't you call? I can't contact you privately. I'm a simple policeman. I don't want to hurt you. No need to be ashamed in front of me. That's not necessary. You once said that you don't lie. Get into the car, please. I can't breathe in here. - Get out! That thing is like a coffin. - Pick up the phone! And what shall I say? - Get in! Say that the woman was on the toilet. Yes. Paschotta speaking. Yes... No! At a rest stop. Yes, the woman needed to pee. What? I'd like to talk to Mrs. Dessaul. Yes? Mrs. Dessaul, please say: "It's nice to meet you" in French. Yes! The exact kilometre information! The exact kilometre information! 30.5. - 30.5. Alright. I'll lead you to the handover place now. You won't drive faster than 100 km/h. I'll call you in twenty minutes with the exact route. Gentlemen, we lost Mrs. Dessaul. The kidnappers sent a message via a phone that can't be located. They now have Mrs. Dessaul as well. If we follow the car with the second hostage, we're risking her life. The Bavarian officials informed us that they won't chase the kidnapper's car any further. The risk is too high. They're only on guard. So they let them get away? - Yes. All of us agree that saving the hostage is of top priority. The kidnappers probably have several security measures until the handover. Yes? Kilometre information! 62.5. - 62.5. Take the next exit and drive to the left then. Through the village. Repeat that! Take the next exit, drive to the left and through the village. Is my husband fine? I know where we're heading. The Karwendel at Mittenwald. I was there with Heinz once. There's a tunnel through the summit station. It leads right to Austria. Yes, I know that, Karl. One can walk up there. There's a path. - Exactly. He'll send us there via detours. Okay. We'll drive there. - Who are you talking to? The "Pea Roller". Okay, we'll have an advance of one hour. I'll take the two to the path. Great. Mountaineering isn't my hobby. Look ahead! You can forget blacks at a height of 3000 metres. A little vacation with leather pants. They won't even let you up there, "Cabbage Roll". Until we're up there, it'll be dark. Do you have your passports in case you get lost, children? We mustn't forget that we're facing at least one perfectly trained perpetrator. And he has an incredible confidence. One should think about exchanging the men every five years. With their confidence being polished for so long, it's normal that this hybris comes up. Yes. Continue on the country road to Mittenwald. After the town sign you have to drive to the centre. After the town exit sign you have to drive back. Turn right after 1.5 kilometres. To the Karwendel mountain station. Mrs. Dessaul, put on the coat that's provided for you. Go to the gondola and wait for more instructions. Keep going! In there! Make yourself flat! Flat! Karl? It's fine. He's a colleague of mine. Are Gerd and "Cabbage Roll" already there? They've been walking for an hour. Through the ass into enjoyment. See you. We're at the top. I see two people at the gondola. Otherwise, everything's quiet. The light is on. I can see the light, you idiot. I'm going to the platform. Only position code from now on. Over. Yes? Close the door, Mrs. Dessaul. Push the green button above the phone. It's a bit windy, but besides that it's fine down here. A great view. All of Mittenwald. It's great here. We'll get your husband. Is everything okay? Sit down! Yes? Mrs. Dessaul, could I talk to my colleague? Get him on the phone! What's wrong? Is there a problem? Did you see that? He cut his throat! That sod! That sod! He knows that we're coming. Mrs. Dessaul! Once you've arrived up here, quickly go to the sun terrace. Say hello to Karl. You may hang up now. We'll do anything he'll say. Nothing uncontrollable will happen. Stay calm! Stay calm! Breathe in and out! Okay? I found a baby on my way and take off its nappy now. Roger! Where are your colleagues? Are they at it? It's done. He wanted to blow us up. I'll get that sod! Turn the coat around. It reflects. Holger? Take cover! He can't do that! I had to shoot off his hands. He has a circulatory shock. The pleasures of the flesh confuse the mind. Where is my husband? What about my husband? Please get away from the terrace and put the coat on correctly. That's what it's there for. Everyone does as I say! Go! Thanks for bringing the money here safely, Karl. You won't leave without giving us Dessaul! He's gambling with your husband's life, madame. You have something that is mine. Throw it into the circle of light. Take your money! Or don't you have the courage? But I'm here! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hey, stay there! Stay there! Mr. Dessaul, do me a favour and show me what's in the bag. I want to see every note. We have time. Starlight and heaven's light are breaking through the skies. Wishes come true, for those who believe in you. Stay down... You sod! You want to shit me! I can't see anything. Holger! Heinz! Stop! Get on the ground! Heinz! Is it you, Karl? Shut up! You'll have enough to tell in Dusseldorf. ATTENTION BORDER Where is Bernd? Where are you? Karl! Answer me! Where are you? We have to drive! This man needs help! A doctor! Bernd is here! He's doing poorly. We have to drive! No! Don't drive! No way! He's still around. You'll drive right into his field of fire. Give me the radio. What do you mean, we'll drive into his line of fire? Karl? What did he mean? What's his plan? What's his plan? What's his plan? I don't know. - What's his plan? I don't know. - What's his plan? I don't know. - What's his plan? The man needs a doctor. That's your responsibility.. You understand what I'm saying? If you risk someone's life because of the paranoia of some policeman... ...and we keep waiting, everything that happens is your responsibility. Karl! Answer me! We have to drive! Holger, help me! - Shut the door! Shut the door! Answer! Bernd is doing shitty. Where are you? Shit! Karl, where are you, dammit? Where are you? Heinz! Take the money and get lost! Think about Sunny. I could get you if I wanted to. Leave! Leave! What's wrong? I heard a shot! Karl? How can the light be turned on in here? - Why don't you do that? From where can the gondola be seen? There are steep slopes everywhere. No! No! No! Cover yourself! Come into the corner! Away from him! You sod! Shitty boxes! - Holger! I should have known! Bernd! Stay awake! Stay awake! What's wrong? - I didn't know this. Gerd! Answer me! Everything's burning! The boxes were prepared like little bombs. We can't throw them out anymore. - Can you bear it? Only just. Don't open a window, otherwise there will be a fire roller. Stand it for as long as possible. We can't cope much longer. Bernd is unconscious, what shall we do? My radio's batteries are melting. Can you hear me? Get out after the second pillar. It has a ladder and it's only ten metres down. Can you hear me? Heinz! Why? What for? The only reason for the kidnapping of Mr. Dessaul was the ransom money. Mr. Dessaul was in the investigation committee that was supposed... ...to see how much influence organised crime had on the government... ...but so far we can't say whether the kidnapping had to do with it. Why was the local police in Mittenwald informed that late? Dusseldorf's special forces had the task to protect Mrs. Dessaul... ...take her to the handover place and monitor the handover. After the shootout that lead to the death of the hostage and the fire in the gondola... ...the officials first wanted to evacuate the gondola as quickly as possible. Good! Keep going! Come! Come! My husband! He'll burn! My husband! - Faster! Keep going! One more! One more! Please! - Keep going! Take the rope and slide down! Hannes! My hands! Hannes! I profoundly regret the death of Holger Dessaul. It fills me with rage, but it seems to be a tragic series of misfortunes. Please stay at the door in the room. Otherwise you'll have to wear a face mask. He'll die. Don't be shocked. Mr. Grigull can't lie normally as his burns are too severe. So far the investigations point towards the conclusion... ...that Holger Dessaul was picked, because he was rich. And because there was a promising access option... ...due to one of the kidnappers, the special forces member Johannes Grigull. It's me. "Wind in the ears". I didn't want anything to happen to our people... Neither Ollie, nor Bernd and "Colour Error". In that case everything's fine. That he'd shoot Dessaul... He didn't tell me all that. I stated that only Heinz and I were involved... I didn't get the impression that there was much interest in Heinz. Why? Why, why? Why didn't you just place a bomb in a church at Christmas to blackmail priests? Were you pressurised by Heinz? I just want to know. Three weeks ago he came to me. He talked to me... You know... With me it doesn't matter.... No family... No... I see it differently than you. - What do you think? Well... Incidentally one gets used to it. To win... I didn't want to go on patrol again... At the station with young snots. Once you're used to it... There's more... Do you think I'll fall asleep before... Don't leave! I wished my heart wasn't this strong. Karl! Mrs. Dessaul claims that the kidnapping of her husband was a planned murder. I'll reveal the conspiracy of the murderers who act like my husband's friends now. Their shock is a masquerade. They initiated the kidnapping. They did business with organised crime and my husband was able to prove that. Her husband supposedly threatened the responsible... ...to go public with his knowledge, a few weeks ago. That's why the kidnapping was arranged and he was murdered. The theory of the accident is a farce. The headshot that killed my husband wasn't made public yet. The kidnapper was a trained murderer, a former cop. The ransom was his payment. She got a lawyer and wants you to testify for her. Me? Hello. Yes. Come on. We don't want to gloss over anything, Karl. But do you think I'm the member of a... ...political conspiracy against a little undersecretary? Can you imagine that? I did let you go. I accepted full responsibility. Why didn't you inform the Bavarian colleagues... ...when you knew where you were heading? Listen, Karl! I think both of us aren't too interested in everything going public, right? Neither is our department. That's why I want you to remember, that being a policeman... ...you can't be relieved from your official secret. Good morning. - Good morning, Norbert. Mr. Simon just told me that he quits his job as a policeman. He'd like your lawyer to contact him. He said he'll do anything to help finding the truth. Bootsmann! Bootsmann! Make sure they don't get close to the pool. They're still small, they can't swim. Bootsmann! Bootsmann! It fell asleep. Yes.
