Captions made possible by HOME BOX OFFICE A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P. I THINK IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS RIGHT OFF THE BAT. BY SIMPLE DEFINITION, WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF WINNING WARS. WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED AN ARMY FOR ? TAKE THE COLD WAR, WE WON WITHOUT FIRING A SINGLE SHOT. WHY ? NUMBER ONE, WE JUST FLAT OUT, OUT-SPENT THEM. THE RUSSIANS COULDN'T SHOVEL MONEY INTO THE FIRE AS FAST AS WE COULD. NUMBER TWO, AND THIS IS WHERE MY COMMAND COMES IN, TECHNOLOGY. NOBODY SHAPES NATURE THE WAY WE DO. WE TAKE ATOMS AND MOLECULES AND BEFORE WE'RE FINISHED WITH THEM, THEY'RE EVERYTHING FROM COMBAT BOOTS TO BOMBS. THE KIND OF BOMBS THAT NOBODY FROM THE OTHER SIDE WILL EVER SEE UNTIL THE DAMN THING'S PLOWING DOWN THEIR CHIMNEY LIKE SANTA CLAUS FROM HELL ! ( female ) GENERAL ? WHAT ? THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE BEEN HERE. WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE, THAT IS CORRECT. SEVERAL TIMES IN FACT. I HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING COUNT. WELL LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY. YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU A DOCUMENT. I DO. DE-SENSIFUSED, ANTI-TANK, MISSILE. I'LL BE THE FIRST TO AT ADMIT THAT THIS PROGRAM DID HAVE ITS SHARE OF DIFFICULTIES. WE DID EXPERIENCE A GLITCH OR TWO, WITH THE THING, THAT MUCH IS CERTAIN. EVEN A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE CAN MISS A TARGET. GENERAL, I SEE HERE THAT YOU TAPED ELECTRIC HOT PLATES TO THE SURFACE OF THE VEHICLE TO HELP YOUR HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE FIND ITS TARGET AND THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE VEHICLE WAS SO HIGH IT COULD HAVE FRIED AN EGG AT 20 FEET ! ( male ) COMMENCE FIRE ! THERE WAS A VERIFIABLE DEVIATION OF THE STANDARD TEST DATA ACCUMULATION. ( male ) THERE WERE OTHER DEVIATIONS, WERE THERE NOT ? WHAT ABOUT THE PAVEWAY BOMB ? I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THAT PAVEWAY NEVER MISSED. ( female ) IT MISSED BY A MEAN DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES AND NEARLY 50% OF THE TIME. YOU KNOW IN BASEBALL, A GUY WHO HITS .400 IS CONSIDERED PRETTY DAMN GREAT. ( male ) IN BASEBALL THE LOSING TEAM ISN'T KILLED BY THEIR OPPONENTS. BE THAT AS IT MAY, THE PAVEWAY IS ONE HELL OF A BOMB. LASER-GUIDED, STATE-OF-THE-ART. ( female ) AND IT PROVED WHAT ? THAT WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON AS LONG AS THE ENEMY ALLOWS US TO BUILD A TWO STORY CRANE DIRECTLY ABOVE THEIR TANKS ?! WE HAVE HAD SOME SPECTACULAR SUCCESSES. ( male ) SUCH AS ? THAT'S CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. ( male ) GENERAL... ! ( female ) LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR LIST. THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE BATTING AVERAGE IS FOR THE BRADLEY, GENERAL ? IT TAKES PEOPLE WITH SOPHISTICATED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT THESE TESTS AND TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS. IF THE U.S. ARMY ACTED ON THE ADVICE OF EVERY TOM, DICK AND HARRY WHO HAD AN OPINION ON THESE MATTERS, WE'D WIND UP WITH A BUNCH OF B-52s POWERED BY OUTBOARD MOTORS. ( male ) I FAIL TO SEE YOUR POINT. MY POINT IS, THAT A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO CREATE A NEW WEAPON AND IT TAKES TEAMWORK. GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED, TEAMWORK. ( female ) COLONEL JAMES BURTON, WAS HE PART OF YOUR TEAM, GENERAL ? MORE OR LESS. POST, SIR ? SERGEANT. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET TO 4E-624 ? FORWARD INTO THE ESCALATOR, YOUR LEFT, TWO FLIGHTS UP TO FOUR, YOU RIGHT, PROCEED PAST CORRIDOR NINE, FACE LEFT. THANK YOU. ( General ) IT'S NO SECRET THAT COLONEL BURTON HAD A ROCKY TENURE, THAT WE DIDN'T SEE EYE-TO-EYE. BUT IT DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO ! I SPOKE TO GENERAL HALL. GENERAL HALL SPOKE TO GENERAL JONES, GENERAL JONES SPOKE TO ADMIRAL WATTS. WELL THEN WRITE IT DOWN ! THAT TAKES CARE OF SPINA IN RHODE ISLAND, AND MAYS FROM NEBRASKA, ANY DEMOCRATS ? NO, FORGET HIM. BECAUSE HE'S A SCUM-SUCKING JUDAS WHO'D SELL HIS OWN MOTHER FOR A HANDFULL OF VOTES. HOW ABOUT THE SENATE ? THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH. AFTER WE PAPERED HIS STATE WITH CONTRACTS. ALRIGHT THEN LET'S JUST MAKE THE FUSELAGE IN MICHIGAN AND THE LANDING GEAR IN MISSISSIPPI. OH BY ALL MEANS, LET'S KEEP CONGRESSMAN GROVES AND HIS BLOODSUCKING BUDDIES HAPPY. WELCOME, COLONEL. THANK YOU, GENERAL. I THOUGHT YOU AND I OUGHT TO GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY, SIR. FACT IS, I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU. THANK YOU SIR. I DON'T MEAN TO ALARM YOU COLONEL BY THIS NEW JOB OF YOURS, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN TURN INTO A REAL SHIT-BURNIN' DETAIL. YOU'RE GONNA NEED AS MANY FRIENDS AS YOU CAN GET. I'D LIKE YOU TO COUNT ME AS ONE OF THEM. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT SIR. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND, MBA FROM AUBURN. YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER, GENERAL DeGRASSO AND I, ARE OLD FRIENDS. HE SAYS AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED THE SKY IS THE LIMIT. BUT THEN YOU DRAW THE SHORT STRAW. I WAS ASSIGNED, SIR. HELL, IT'S A BUM DEAL, WHOEVER MADE IT. EVERY OTHER YEAR SOMEBODY DECIDES WE'RE SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY. A BUNCH OF PENCIL NECKS PUT THEIR POINTY HEADS TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A PLAN. THIS YEAR, IT'S THE JOINT LIVE-FIRE TEST PROGRAM. STAFFED WITH OFFICERS FROM EVERY BRANCH OF THE SERVICE. SO NOW WE GOT THE ARMY, NAVY, AIR FORCE AND MARINES, DOING A CIRCLE-JERK OVER WEAPONS TESTING AND YOU GET TO HOLD THE BIG DICK. I MEAN, WHO THINKS UP THIS NONSENSE ? CONGRESS SIR ? AND SO IT SHOULD, THAT'S ITS JOB. YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ME CRITICIZE THE HILL. ALTHOUGH YOU'D THINK CONGRESS HAS ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN SHIT TO SHOVEL WITHOUT WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE. WELL, I'M NOT ANTICIPATING ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE POSTING SIR. NEITHER AM I. A MAN DOESN'T COME AS FAR IN HIS CAREER AS YOU HAVE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO WALK A MINEFIELD. HOWARD MATHESON. CAME HERE TWO ROTATIONS AGO, THAT MARLIN IS NOT THE ONLY THING HE CAUGHT. I GOT HIM INTO SIN-COM WHEN HE LEFT HERE. NOW HE'S THE HEAD OF THEIR MISSILE TESTING. BLAKE GELMORE, YOU KNOW BLAKE ? NO, SIR. THE MAN WASN'T EVEN A FULL BRED COLONEL WHEN HE LEFT HERE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. A FEW CONTRACTS LATER AND LOOK AT HIM... THE MAN COULD BUY AND SELL BOTH OF US A THOUSAND TIMES OVER. LUCKY MAN. SMART MAN. FIRST-RATE SOLDIER, JUST LIKE YOU COLONEL. KNEW HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF A DIFFICULT SITUATION. THIS NEW JOB OF YOURS IS TOO TOUGH FOR ANY ONE MAN TO GO IT ALONE. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE TEAMWORK. HERE YOU GO. THESE ARE A COUPLE OF YOUR PROJECTS UNDERGOING TESTING. THE UH-60 HELICOPTER, THE AV-8B JUMP-JET AND THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE. ALL OUTSTANDING PROGRAMS, ALL ORGANIZED AND READY TO GO. I DID A LITTLE HOMEWORK FOR YOU, GIVE YOU A LEG UP. WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT GENERAL. YOU KNOW YOU COULD RETURN THE FAVOR BY GIVING THE BRADLEY THERE A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION. ATTENTION ? WE NEED IT IN THE FIELD. THE SOONER THE BETTER. JUST MAKE SURE IT GOES ON TOP OF ALL THE THINGS IN YOUR "IN BOX" SO IT'LL GET IN YOUR "OUT BOX" AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU COLONEL. THANK YOU SIR. COLONEL. SIR. NEXT TIME YOU'RE TOLD TO REPORT TO THIS OFFICE, BE ON TIME. YES, SIR. SIR. COLONEL JAMES BURTON, I'M HERE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE TEST. STRAIGHT AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU. ( recruits ) * I WANNA BE AN AIR FORCE MAJOR * * I WANNA BE AN AIR FORCE MAJOR * ( male ) THERE HE IS. THAT'S THE GUY ?! THAT'S HIM, SUPPOSED TO BE REAL SMART. SQUADRON OFFICER'S SCHOOL, AIR COMMAND, AND STAFF COLLEGE. FIRST TOUR WITH THE PENTAGON ? HE WAS AT THE AIR FORCE LAB IN ALBUQUERQUE WHEN CONGRESS CALLED. HE'S A SOLDIER, NOT JUST A MANAGER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? HE'S PUT IN HIS FAIR SHARE OF FLYING TIME. LOOKS LIKE A FUCKING CHOIR BOY TO ME. MAYBE, BUT NOTHING GETS ORDERED INTO PRODUCTION UNTIL HE SIGNS OFF. COLONEL BURTON, J.D. BACH. WELCOME TO THE TEAM. COLONEL BACH. YES SIR, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THIS IS MAJOR SAYERS, OUR CHIEF TESTER. ARMY WEAPONS RESEARCH LAB. ( Sayers ) SO HOW'D AN AIR FORCE GUY END UP OVERSEEING TESTS RUN BY THE ARMY ? WELL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. HOW'S THAT ? CONGRESS COULD HAVE APPOINTED SOMEONE FROM THE NAVY. ( announcer ) THE RANGE IS NOW HOT, THE RANGE IS NOW HOT. COMMENCING THE ARMOR PENETRATION TESTS ON THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE. ATTENTION ON THE FIRING LINE. ATTENTION ON THE FIRING LINE. ARE YOU READY ON THE RIGHT ? READY ON THE LEFT ? FIRING LINE IS READY. FIRING DETAIL, COMMENCE FIRING. CEASE FIRE, CEASE FIRE. ( Bach ) OH, THAT'S DAMN IMPRESSIVE ARMOR. ALRIGHT, DRINKS ARE ON ME GENTLEMEN. ( Sayers ) JOINING US COLONEL BURTON ? ( Bach ) CONGRATULATIONS, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP ON THAT ONE. WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP ON THAT ONE. SAY COLONEL, ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US ? SHOULDN'T WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK ? NO, NO, ACTUALLY, SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. SEE, THE FIRE TEAM GOES OUT THERE FIRST, NO ONE ELSE IS ALLOWED NEAR THE VEHICLE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER HOUR. WHY IS THAT ? WITH ANY ANTI-ARMOR TEST INVOLVING A LIVE ROUND, THERE'S ALWAYS A FREAK CHANCE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BLOW AFTER THE FACT. PLUS, WE DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU, FIRST DAY ON THE JOB, COLONEL. SO HOW ABOUT THAT DRINK ? SOUNDS GOOD MAJOR. THERE'LL BE A PHONE CALL FOR YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AT EXACTLY 1100 HOURS. IT'S IMPORTANT YOU BE THERE. GOOD MORNING. ( chatter ) WELCOME SIR. MORNING SERGEANT. GOOD MORNING, SIR. I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF UNPACKING A FEW OF YOUR THINGS. THANK YOU SERGEANT. FAMILY SIR ? WHAT'S THAT ? FAMILY. THAT'S MY UNCLE. HE WAS A FLIER IN WORLD WAR II. HMM... WHAT'S THAT ? THIS IS THE PLANE I LEARNED TO FLY IN, A T-28. I USED TO TAKE HER UP, SLIDE THE CANOPY BACK, AND FLY FOR HOURS. JUST ME IN THE SKY. PERSONALLY SIR, I LIKE THE SKY RIGHT WHERE IT IS-- WITH ME ON THE GROUND LOOKING UP AT IT. SO, WHERE YOU FROM SIR ? JUST OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO. AND WHERE WOULD THAT BE ? NORMAL. NORMAL ILLINOIS, IS THAT ON THE MAP ? YES SERGEANT, IT IS. IS IT NORMAL IN NORMAL ? I THINK THE WORD IS, UNEVENTFUL. ARE YOU GETTING PAID BY THE HOUR COLONEL ? NO, NO, I GOT AN APPOINTMENT. ( phone ) I'LL TAKE THIS SERGEANT, THANK YOU. FINE. COLONEL BURTON. HELLO ? THE TEST ON THE BRADLEY, I HEAR YOU WANTED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. HOW DID YOU HEAR THAT ? WHEN IT COMES TO THE BRADLEY, FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS COLONEL. Who is this ? I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. WELL WHOEVER YOU ARE, I DON'T TAKE UNSOLICITED ADVICE FROM PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW. JUST MAKE SURE YOU READ THE FINE PRINT, COLONEL. COLONEL BURTON. YOU'RE UP EARLY SIR. I THOUGHT I'D DROP BY ON MY WAY TO THE OFFICE, SERGEANT. CHECK OUT THE BRADLEY. SIR. ISN'T YOUR OFFICE 40 MILES THAT WAY SIR ? YES SERGEANT, YES IT IS. HAS ANYTHING BEEN ALTERED ON THIS VEHICLE SINCE THE TEST ? NO SIR. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING, SIR ? JUST READING THE FINE PRINT SERGEANT. JUST READING THE FINE PRINT. STINGER MISSILES, 50 TRACERS. 7.62 TRACERS. 25 MM ROUNDS. WHAT'S THIS ? THAT'S WHAT WAS USED ON THE BRADLEY SIR. THIS WRITING, IT'S ROMANIAN, ISN'T IT ? YES SIR, IT IS. SIR, COLONEL BACH AND MAJOR SAYERS WON'T BE HERE UNTIL NOON. THAT'S WHEN OUR FIRST TEST OF THE DAY IS SCHEDULED SIR. WELL, THIS ISN'T EXACTLY AN ALL-OUT TEST SERGEANT. MORE LIKE A LITTLE POP QUIZ. I'M NOT SURE REGULATIONS ALLOWS US TO BORROW THE DOOR FROM THE AMMUNITION SHED FOR A POP QUIZ, SIR. SIR, REGULATIONS STATE THAT THE AMMUNITION SHED SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT OPEN, SIR. DULY NOTED SERGEANT. I BELIEVE THAT REGULATION ALSO APPLIED TO REMOVING THE DOOR ENTIRELY COLONEL. ALSO DULY NOTED. FIRE WHEN READY. BACK BLAST AREA CLEAR ! ON THE WAY SIR. FIRE. STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT... YOU WRECKED A DOOR ? COLONEL, THE AMMUNITION THAT WAS USED ON THE LAST TEST ON THE BRADLEY IS THE SAME AS WE USED ON THIS DOOR. ROMANIAN... ARGUABLY THE MOST INEFFECTIVE AMMUNITION IN THE WORLD. NO WONDER THE BRADLEY CAME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS. WELL, THIS IS VERY SERIOUS. IT IS ! YES, YOU DESTROYED A DOOR. COLONEL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TEST ON AN ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER, A VEHICLE THAT WILL CARRY SOLDIERS INTO COMBAT. RIGHT, BUT THIS DOOR IS PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. I ASSUME YOU KNEW THAT. THE SHELL BARELY PENETRATED THE DOOR. OKAY, BUT NOW IT'S ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE. HOW YOU GONNA GET IT BACK ON ITS HINGES ? RIGHT NOW I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT ! YES, BUT THIS DOOR PROTECTS OUR AMMUNITION. THE AMMUNITION, DOESN'T WORK ! BUT WE NEED THE AMMUNITION FOR OUR TESTS. LOOK-- I'LL BUY THE ARMY A NEW GODAMN DOOR. YOU CAN'T AFFORD A DOOR LIKE THAT. DID YOU SEE WHAT IT STOOD UP TO ? EXACTLY ! SOME SPITBALL FROM ROMANIA ! IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ONLY SOVIET ARMS WOULD BE USED IN THESE TESTS. WELL, YES, AND ROMANIA IS ONE OF THE SOVIET BLOCS... ISN'T IT ? COLONEL BURTON, WE'VE BEEN TESTING THE BRADLEY FOR SOME TIME NOW. YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF SOME OF THE STEPS WE'VE TAKEN. THE ROMANIAN ROCKET IS ONLY 73 MILLIMETERS, THAT'S LESS THAN 85 MILLIMETER RUSSIAN VERSION. A SMALLER DIAMETER MEANS A SMALLER EXPLOSION, A SMALLER HOLE AND LESS SHRAPNEL. WE'RE INTERESTED IN CONDUCTING BALLISTIC TESTS USING ALL SORTS OF AMMUNITION IN VARYING DIAMETERS TO DETERMINE THE EXACT THRESHOLD OF THE BRADLEY'S TOLERANCE. SO FAR, IT'S HELD UP AGAINST EVERYTHING WE'VE THROWN AT IT SIR. SOVIET, ROMANIAN. LATVIAN, LITHUANIAN... LIKE A ROCK. MY APOLOGIES. YOU'RE NEW TO THE PROJECT. THERE'S A LOT TO CATCH UP ON. YOU'RE RIGHT. SO IF YOU'LL JUST GET ME THE TEST REPORTS, I CAN CATCH RIGHT UP. HOW'S THAT COLONEL ? SEND ME THE DATA, I'LL DO MY HOMEWORK, AND WE CAN PUSH THIS THING RIGHT THROUGH. WE'VE GOT FIVE YEARS OF TEST REPORTS ON THIS MODEL ALONE, SIR. WE HAVE A SCHEDULE TO MAINTAIN. LET'S KEEP TO IT, TO GET THE BRADLEY INTO PRODUCTION, ASAP. WHAT DO YOU SAY ? THANK YOU GENTLEMEN. THIS COULD BLOW THE WHOLE DEAL. YOU'VE GOT TO NIP THIS IN THE BUD LIKE YOU DID WITH THE LAST GUY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. SIR, HE WANTS TO SEE THE REPORTS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP HIM ? JUST GIVE HIM THE REPORTS. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ? I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW HIM A SINGLE PAGE. LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. GIVE HIM EVERYTHING HE WANTS. EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER. EVERYTHING. SERGEANT ? HERE SIR. WHAT THE HECK IS ALL THIS ? EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE BRADLEY AND WEREN'T AFRAID TO ASK. EVERY MEMO ON EVERY LAST NUT AND BOLT. I WONDER WHICH NATIONAL FOREST LAID DOWN IT'S LIFE FOR THIS PROJECT ? YOU READ ANY OF THIS STUFF ? NOT YET SIR. I WAS HOPIN' YOU'D SHOW UP WITH THE CLIFF NOTES. I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO START. MAYBE THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA. I DON'T GET IT. WHAT ? THAT. IT'S THE BRADLEY. IF THAT'S THE BRADLEY, THEN WHAT'S THIS ? WHAT'S THE DATE ? 1968. THE QUESTION IS HOW DID THEY GET TO THAT FROM THIS ? GENTLEMEN, OUR MISSION WAS TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT AN INFANTRY TRANSPORT VEHICLE, THAT WOULD BE A WORTHY REPLACEMENT FOR THE M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. WE HAVE MET THAT OBJECTIVE AND THEN SOME. THE BRADLEY ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. IT WILL BRING TROOPS TO A COMBAT ZONE SWIFTLY, EFFICIENTLY, AND SAFELY. IT WILL HOLD 11 MEN PLUS A DRIVER, AND FEATURES A 20 MILLIMETER CANNON, WHICH WILL PROVIDE AMPLE FIREPOWER AND AT THE SAME TIME, FLEXIBILITY. LIGHTLY ARMORED, SPEEDY AND SOLIDLY ENGINEERED. OUR TROOPS WILL BE ARRIVING AT THE BATTLEFIELD IN THE VERY FINEST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY HAS TO OFFER AND AT A MILLION AND A HALF PER, A REAL BARGAIN. NICE WORK COLONEL ! OUTSTANDING ! DAMN IMPRESSIVE ! IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A BIG TAXI CAB DRIVING GUYS TO THE BATTLEFIELD AND GO BACK HOME. UH-HUH. BUT HOW DID IT END UP WITH A TURRET ON TOP ? THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD COLONEL SMITH BUT, SOMETHING WRONG GENERAL ? WELL, WITH THIS GORILLA IN PRODUCTION I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S GONNA BE ANYTHING LEFT IN THE BUDGET FOR MY SCOUT. I DOUBT IT BOB. YOU DON'T NEED SCOUTS-- YOU HAVE RADAR, AIR-RECON, SATELLITES. YOU ALWAYS NEED A SCOUT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING ? WHY COULDN'T THIS THING SERVE AS A SCOUT ? BUT IT'S A TROOP CARRIER GENERAL. THIS IS A SPEEDY VEHICLE. WHY CAN'T IT BE BOTH ? FOR ONE THING, IT'S TOO BIG. AND FOR THE OTHER, YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE OUT ALL THAT MUCH FROM INSIDE. SOUNDS LIKE A DESIGN FLAW TO ME. DESIGN FLAW ? WE'LL JUST STICK A TURRET ON TOP WITH LOTS OF OPTICALS. BUT THEN SIR, IT WILL BE EVEN BIGGER. WELL, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM SMITH ? NOT ELEGANT ENOUGH FOR YOU ? WELL THE THING IS GENERAL, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DO A "SNEAK AND PEAK" WHEN YOU'RE OVER TEN-FEET TALL. HE'S GOT A POINT BOB. ALL I KNOW WE NEED A SCOUT, THIS IS FAST ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB AND IT'S FUNDED. WE'RE A HAIR OVER BUDGET. IF YOU TURN THE BRADLEY INTO SCOUT, WE'LL BE SELLING THEM OFF TO SOME EL PRESIDENTE DE CHIMICHANGA IN NO TIME ! ANYTHING FOR SURVEILLANCE ENDS UP SOUTH OF THE BORDER BEFORE THE PAINT EVEN DRIES ! WHEN YOU NEEDED THAT ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN, WHO BACKED YOU UP ON THAT ? YOU DID BOB. WHO TESTIFIED TO APPROPRIATIONS ON BEHALF OF THAT GUN ? YOU DID BOB. I'M TALKING TO APPROPRIATIONS NEXT WEEK, DO I SELL YOU ON MY SCOUT OR DO I NOT ? YOU DID BOB. HOW ABOUT PORTHOLES ALONG THE SIDE ? FOR INDIVIDUAL FIREARMS SO THE FELLAS CAN STICK OUT THEIR GUNS AND SHOOT PEOPLE ! GOOD, AND YOU KNOW WHAT COLONEL ? WE ALREADY HAVE THE TURRET, WE OUGHTA GET THE BIGGEST BANG WE CAN UP THERE. I'M SORRY, "BANG" SIR ? YOU CAN'T HURT ANYBODY WITH THAT PANSY-ASSED GUN ! ADD ON SOME FIREPOWER ! WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO FIT THE EXTRA AMMO ? I DON'T KNOW. CAN YOU SHIFT THINGS AROUND, MAKE ROOM ! YOU ALREADY GOT 4,400 ROUNDS OF MACHINE GUN AMMO YOU WANNA ADD 25 MILLIMETER SHELLS ? THE GENERAL WANTS HIS AMMO. HE CAN'T HAVE HIS AMMO. NOT UNLESS HE'S RUNS ALONGSIDE THIS THING CARRYING IT. WELL, CAN YOU JUST SQUEEZE IT IN ? NO. OH COME ON, JUST SQUEEZE IT IN ! WE'RE NOT TRYING ON LEVI'S HERE COLONEL, ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT IN A VEHICLE THIS SIZE YOU CAN'T FIND ROOM FOR A FEW ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION ?! NOT IN ITS CURRENT CONFIGURATION, NO SIR. SO, THE CONFIGURATION IS WRONG. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING YOU CAN DUMP. "DUMP", SIR ? SOMETHING YOU DON'T NEED. GENERAL, THE INTERIOR IS VERY SPARE. BESIDES THE AMMUNITION AND THE MEN... MAYBE YOU CAN LEAVE ONE OF THE FELLAS BEHIND. PUT THE AMMO WHERE THE MEN GO. SIR... IT IS A TROOP CARRIER. SO, MAKE A COUPLE OF EXTRA TRIPS, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ? THEY WANT A TRANSPORT THAT DOESN'T CARRY MEN, AND A SCOUT THAT'S GOT A CANNON AS BIG AS A TANK'S. AND PORTHOLES. OH GREAT, PORTHOLES. THE GUYS CAN SHOOT AT WHATEVER THEY CAN'T HIT WITH THEIR CANNON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY THE DAMN THING JONES, JUST DRAW IT. THAT'S ONE HELL OF A CANNON. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WHY ? YOU GO OUT IN A BATTLEFIELD WITH THIS PECKER STICKING OUT OF YOUR TURRET THE ENEMY IS GONNA UNLOAD ON YOU WITH ALL THEY GOT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL PAINT A BIG RED BULL'S-EYE ON THE SIDE. BUT IT'S A TROOP CARRIER, NOT A TANK. YOU WANT ME TO PUT A SIGN ON IT IN 50 LANGUAGES-- "I AM A TROOP CARRIER, NOT A TANK, "PLEASE DON'T SHOOT AT ME" ?! THIS WAS GOING TO BE SO BEAUTIFUL. ( applause ) THAT'S GOOD WORK, SMITH. LOOKS PERFECT TO ME. THANK YOU SIR. THE THING IS-- YES GENERAL ? LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE A TANK WITH THAT CANNON ON TOP. PROBABLY GONNA DRAW MORE FIRE. ACTUALLY SIR, THAT HAS COME TO OUR ATTENTION. WE KNOW IT'S NOT A TANK, BUT WILL THE OTHER SIDE ? I GUESS WE COULD ALWAYS THICKEN THE ARMOR, TOUGHEN UP THE HIDE A BIT. COLONEL SMITH, COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU PUT THOSE PORTHOLES THERE ? YES SIR, AS PER YOUR REQUEST SO THE MEN CAN SHOOT OUT AT THE ENEMY. YOU'RE JOKING, AREN'T YOU ? BESIDES PORTHOLES, WHAT ARE WE IN NOW, THE NAVY ? SAY... YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE THIS THING AMPHIBIOUS ? GET THE TROOPS ACROSS A RIVER ? NO. NO SIR. NO, NO, NO, NO. AMPHIBIOUS ? THE BRADLEY'S SUPPOSED TO SWIM ? IN THEORY AT LEAST. AMPHIBIOUS TROOP CARRIER SLASH SCOUT... SLASH TANK. A COUPLA MORE MONTHS, I BET THEY CAN GET THIS THING TO FLY. WHAT'S THIS IN THE MARGIN ? "PLEASE HELP ME, I AM LOSING MY MIND, "R.L.S." LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROBERT LAUREL SMITH, HEAD OF OVERSIGHT AND DEVELOPMENT. ALUMINUM. THIS THING'S GOT AN ALUMINUM SKIN. HUH ? ANYTHING AN ENEMY TANK FIRES AT IS GONNA GO THROUGH IT LIKE A HOT KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER. WE'RE DOING THE 'SPECS ON USING STEEL RATHER THAN ALUMINUM. OF COURSE, STEEL IS MUCH HEAVIER THAN ALUMINUM, SO IT WON'T GO AS FAST. WE CAN'T LOSE SPEED, WE LOSE SPEED, IT WON'T WORK AS A SCOUT VEHICLE. IT WON'T KEEP PACE WITH TANKS, EITHER. THICKER ARMOR'S A REACTIVE MEASURE. LET'S THINK PRO-ACTIVE HERE. I SAY EQUIP THE THING WITH ANTI-TANK MISSILES, THEN IT CAN BLAST THOSE ENEMY TANKS BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO FIRE. WHAT DO YOU THINK COLONEL ? FINE. ANTI-TANK MISSILES ? I DON'T KNOW. WHERE DO I PUT THEM ? THE MEN WILL HAVE TO WEAR THE MISSILES AS HATS ! I DON'T KNOW JONES. THAT'S WHY YOU GET PAID THE BIG BUCKS. COLONEL, THERE'S NO ROOM. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT-- A PAIR OF LEVI'S, I KNOW, I KNOW ! GODAMMIT ! WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS 11 YEARS WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT ! EXCEPT AN ULCER THE SIZE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND A CAREER THAT'S ON PERMANENT HOLD ! YOU SEE THIS ?! I'VE BEEN A BIRD COLONEL SO LONG I SWEAR I'M GROWING FEATHERS ! IF YOU HAVE TO DESIGN HATS TO HAUL THOSE GODAMN MISSILES, THEN JUST DO IT. EXCUSE ME SIR... LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF I CAN HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE. IF YOU'D ALL JUST TAKE YOUR SEATS. THANK YOU. WE ARE PLEASED TO PRESENT A SCALE MODEL OF THE NEW BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE. * AMERICA * AMERICA FEATURING SCOUT, TROOP TRANSPORT, AND ANTI-TANK CAPABILITIES, IT CARRIES SIX MEN. HOW MANY WAS IT SUPPOSED TO CARRY ? ELEVEN. THE BRADLEY IS OUTFITTED WITH THE MOST SOPHISTICATED SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT EVER DEVELOPED. IT IS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A RAPID FIRE CANNON, AND AN ANTI-TANK ROCKET LAUNCHER. WHICH MEANS IT'S LOADED WITH... ...1500 SHELLS AND 10-TOE ANTI-TANK MISSILES. SO IN SUMMATION GENTLEMEN, WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS... ( girl ) A TROOP TRANSPORT THAT CAN'T CARRY TROOPS, A RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLE THAT'S TOO CONSPICUOUS TO DO RECONNAISSANCE, AND A QUASI-TANK THAT HAS LESS ARMOR THAN A SNOW BLOWER BUT HAS ENOUGH AMMO TO TAKE OUT HALF OF D.C. FANTASTIC. CONGRATULATIONS GENERAL SMITH. GENERAL ?! HELLUVA JOB. GENERAL ? LET'S BUILD IT. THEY'RE BUILDING IT ?! THIS IS WHAT WE'RE BUILDING ? * AMERICA * PLEASE BE SEATED. THIS WILL BE BRIEF, AS I'M NEEDED AT THE OVAL OFFICE. I WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MORNING'S NEW YORK TIMES. IF YOU YOU'D BE SO KIND TO TURN TO THE EDITORIAL PAGE. IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT EVERY WEAPON WE PRODUCE IS AN OVER-PRICED PIECE OF JUNK. NOW, THAT'S NOT NEWS. CRITICS HAVE SAID IT FOR YEARS. WHAT WAS NEWS TO ME TOUCHED ON OUR SUPPOSEDLY SPECTACULAR "Sgt. YORK" ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN. IT SAYS THERE WHEN THE Sgt. YORK PROVED INCAPABLE OF HITTING AIRPLANES, WE TEST FIRED IT AT HOVERING HELICOPTERS. WHEN IT FAILED TO HIT HOVERING HELICOPTERS, WE FIRED IT AT STATIONARY TARGETS AND IT MISSED THOSE. NOW IS THIS POSSIBLE, GENERAL KEANE ? THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROXIMITY FUSING. ACCORDING TO THIS, ONE MISSILE LOCKED ON TO A VENTILATION FAN IN THE LATRINE ! AND DESTROYED THE LATRINE. WERE WE TEST FIRING AT LATRINE'S THAT DAY ? MY FIRST SERGEANT WAS IN THAT LATRINE AT THE TIME AND I CAN ASSURE YOU HE'S AROUND TO SWEAR OTHERWISE. WHY AM I LEARNING ABOUT THESE THINGS IN THE NEWSPAPER ? IT MAKES ME LOOK FOOLISH. AND I AM NOT A FOOLISH MAN. GENERAL CUSHING, ARE YOU HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE MAVERICK MISSILE YOU'RE TESTING ? NO SIR. ADMIRAL MOREHOUSE, ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE A-12 ? NONE WHATSOEVER SIR. GENERAL PARTRIDGE... SIR ! ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BRADLEY ? NO SIR, ABSOLUTELY NOT. PRODUCTION IS IMMINENT. MR. SECRETARY, I BELIEF THE PRESS IS ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE, LOOKING FOR PROBLEMS WHERE NONE EXIST. LET'S HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT GENERAL. BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION WHO DO HAVE PROBLEMS. TERRORISTS IN LEBANON, AND COLONEL KADAFI IN LIBYA, AND SANDINISTAS IN NICARAGUA, AND LET'S NOT FORGET OUR ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH THE SOVIET UNION. FRANKLY, I DON'T APPRECIATE CALLS FROM REPORTERS AND CONGRESSMEN ASKING ME WHY NOTHING WE ARE WORKING ON WORKS. AND I CAN'T ANSWER THEM BECAUSE THE MEN IN CHARGE OF DEVELOPING THESE SYSTEMS TELL ME EVERYTHING IS JUST PEACHY ! SO, IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS, GOOD. IF YOU DO, GET RID OF THEM. I WANT THESE WEAPONS BUILT. IF NOT BY YOU, I'LL FIND MEN WHO CAN. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME SIR ? YES I DO. CLOSE THE DAMN DOOR, COME ON. ABOUT THESE TESTS YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT, CONDUCTING ON THE BRADLEY. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE CONCERNED. BUT IF YOU KNEW THE VEHICLE AS I DO, AN ARMORED WARFARE EXPERT INSTEAD OF A FLIER, YOU WOULDN'T BE CONCERNED, AND YOU'D UNDERSTAND THE BRADLEY IS A GOOD VEHICLE. 4,000 AMERICANS WILL BE EMPLOYED BUILDING IT, THE ARMY WANTS IT. ONCE YOU'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO READ THE FILES... I'VE READ THE FILES, SIR. 200 PAGES ON THE REAR DOOR, 250 PAGES ON THE PAINT JOB, COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF COMBAT CONDITIONS-- NOT A SINGLE TEST THAT INDICATES WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE BRADLEY TAKES A HIT. WHICH IS WHY I'VE ORDERED A... FULL-UP LIVE FIRE TEST. I WANT TO EQUIP A BRADLEY WITH ALL THE AMMUNITION IT WOULD TAKE INTO BATTLE, FILL ALL THE FUEL TANKS, AND, HIT IT WITH A SOVIET ANTI-TANK WEAPON, TO SEE HOW IT'LL HOLD UP. CANCEL IT. SIR ? I THINK WE'RE HAVING A COMMUNICATION MELTDOWN HERE, COLONEL. WHATEVER PROBLEMS THERE ARE, WE'LL FIX THEM, IN THE FIELD, AFTER THEY'RE DEPLOYED. THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE AROUND HERE COLONEL, THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GONNA DO THIS. NOBODY TAKES YOUR JOB MORE SERIOUSLY THAN I DO, BUT I ALSO HAVE A JOB. GOTTA GET THAT BRADLEY DEPLOYED. I WANT THAT ROCKET LAUNCHER POINTED AT THE SOVIETS. HERE. JESUS. DISMISSED. AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON SIR. AFTERNOON. FANNING ! YES, SIR. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ? DON'T ASK. WHAT'S THIS ? IT WAS ON YOUR DESK WHEN I GOT BACK FROM LUNCH. "SOME AMMUNITION FOR YOUR BRADLEY BATTLE." IT'S A BRITISH ARMY TEST REPORT. TOP SECRET TOO. UNTIL IT LANDED HERE. GENERAL SMITH, JIM BURTON. HOW DID YOU FIND ME ? YOU HAVE VERY DISTINCTIVE HANDWRITING. I'VE BEEN READING MEMOS ON THE BRADLEY GOING BACK TO 1968, WITH YOUR HANDWRITTEN NOTES IN THE MARGIN, ALL... INITIALED BY YOU. THIS HANDWRITING ? WE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN TALKING. LOOK, YOU CONTACTED ME, GENERAL. NO. YOU RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUSLY LEAK ABOUT WHICH I KNOW NOTHING. SO THE BRITISH FOUND OUT THAT ALUMINUM BURNS, AND GIVES OFF A TOXIC GAS WHEN HIT BY A SHELL. BAD NEWS FOR MEN IN ALUMINUM ARMORED VEHICLES, ENOUGH SAID. COULDN'T WE-- COULDN'T WE SIT DOWN SOMEWHERE AND ACTUALLY TALK ? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND COLONEL ? IF THE PENTAGON HAD THEIR CHOICE OF BUSTING US OR NAILING A SOVIET SPY, THEY WOULD CHOOSE US IN A HEARTBEAT. WHO EXACTLY IS "US" GENERAL ? THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE PENTAGON WHO ARE FED UP WATCHING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROWN AWAY ON DEFECTIVE WEAPONS UPON WHICH OUR TROOPS ARE SUPPOSED TO STAKE THEIR LIVES. PEOPLE LIKE YOU COLONEL, WE ARE THE ENEMY. TO WHOM ? TO MAJORS WHO WANT TO BE COLONELS, TO COLONELS WHO WANT TO BE GENERALS, TO GENERALS WHO WANT THAT FOURTH STAR. YOU BET WE ARE THE ENEMY. NOBODY MOVES UP WITHOUT GETTIN' THINGS DONE. WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IS THE ONE WHO DROPS THE BALL 'CAUSE, IF YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DROPS THE BALL, NO PROMOTION, NO STAR, NO CUSHY JOB WITH A CONTRACT WHEN YOU RETIRE. WHICH IS WHY COLONEL, ANY AND EVERYONE ATTACHED TO THE BRADLEY WILL SEE TO IT, TO STOP YOUR TESTS. GENERAL, I APPRECIATE YOUR INTERESTS IF NOT YOUR METHODS. WHATEVER DISAGREEMENTS I MAY OR MAY NOT BE HAVING OVER THE BRADLEY WILL BE RESOLVED ABOVE BOARD. NOW, IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, I'M SURE THE WASHINGTON POST WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU. ME ? THE PRESS, ARE YOU CRAZY ? THE ARMY IS MY LIFE. LIKE YOU COLONEL, I WORK INSIDE THE SYSTEM. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PRAYER IN HELL OF RUNNING YOUR TESTS. NOT UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SACRIFICE YOUR CAREER. AND IF YOU THINK YOU'RE SAFE BECAUSE CONGRESS GAVE YOU YOUR JOB YOU BETTER THINK AGAIN. GOOD DAY COLONEL. GOOD LUCK. SO WHY DID YOU SEND ME THAT REPORT ? NICE TO SEE YOU GENERAL. NICE TO SEE YOU. EVENING SIR. EVENING SIR. SO SHE LEANED OVER TO ME AND WHISPERED, WHY DO YOU THINK THE GENERAL ALWAYS STANDS AT ATTENTION ?! SORRY TO DISTURB YOU SIR, BUT MAJOR SAYERS IS IN THE LIBRARY. TELL MAJOR SAYERS I'M BUSY. SORRY SIR, BUT HE SAID TO TELL YOU THE LITTLE PRICK ORDERED TESTS ON THE BRADLEY. WHAT ?! I'LL HAVE HIS ASS IN THE SLING SO FAST. WHOSE ASS, MAJOR SAYERS OR THE LITTLE PRICK ? GENERAL SIR, HE NOW SEEMS TO KNOW ABOUT THE STUDY THE BRITS DID. WHAT STUDY ? THE BRITS DID A STUDY ON ALUMINUM. THAT WOULD BE THE SAME ALUMINUM USED ON THE BRADLEY SIR. WHEN HIT BY A SHELL IT HAS A TENDENCY TO BURN, WHEN IT BURNS IT GIVES OFF A TOXIC GAS. GODAMMIT. WE FOUGHT A REVOLUTION SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FUCKING BRITISH ! SO WHY ARE THEY MESSING THINGS UP NOW ? I THOUGHT YOU TALKED TO HIM. I DID. THE MAN MUST BE AN IDIOT OR A FOOL. WELL, CAN'T YOU STOP HIM SIR ? NO, I'M NOT HIS COMMANDING OFFICER. SOME DRAFT-DODGING JUNIOR CONGRESSMAN DECIDED WE NEEDED MORE OBJECTIVITY IN THE TESTING PROCESS. GODAMN CHECKS AND BALANCES. GENERAL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THIS ISN'T JUST A CHECK SIR, IT'S MORE OF A FULL FUCKING BODY BLOCK ! IF WE DON'T GET THE BRADLEY OUT THERE NOW, IT'LL BE STUCK IN DEVELOPMENT FOREVER. START PRODUCTION NOW. THROW BURTON A BONE OR TWO. LET HIM RUN A COUPLE OF TESTS. YES, SIR. GENERAL, ACTUALLY HE'D LIKE TO BLOW IT UP. I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK WHAT BURTON WANTS. LET HIM DO SOME PIDDLY-SHIT STUFF, TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE, SEE IF HE CAN PARALLEL PARK THE FUCKER ! JUST GET IT INTO PRODUCTION. ( woman ) AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE TESTS COLONEL BURTON PROPOSED ? ABSOLUTELY NOT. ABSOLUTELY NOT YES OR ABSOLUTELY NOT NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT ABSOLUTELY. ( male ) ARE YOU QUESTIONING HIS MOTIVES OR HIS METHODS GENERAL ? I HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION COLONEL BURTON'S MOTIVES. I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO HIS METHODS. WHICH BY ANYONE'S DEFINITION WERE SOMEWHAT PECULIAR. I MEAN THERE WERE OTHER WAYS TO FIND OUT IF CLOTHING WOULD CATCH FIRE INSIDE THE BRADLEY WHEN IT TOOK A HIT. LET'S TAKE THE MANNEQUIN THING. COLONEL. YES. PHONE CALL FOR YOU SIR. THEY SAID IT'S IMPORTANT. VERY GOOD. DALTON. YES SIR. I'LL MEET YOU BACK AT THE FIRING AREA. YES, SIR. STRIP THE DUMMIES. SIR ? STRIP THE DUMMIES SERGEANT, NOW. THANK YOU. LET'S GO. FIRE WHEN READY. BACK BLAST AREA CLEAR ! OUT OF THE WAY SIR. FIRE. HOLD IT THERE. LET ME SEE THOSE. THAT LOOKS GOOD, UNIFORMS LOOK GOOD. WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT'S THAT ? ( male ) THAT'S PART OF OUR TEST COLONEL. WAIT A MINUTE. ( Partridge ) CERTAINLY NO ONE IN MY COMMAND GAVE THE ORDER TO STRIP THE DUMMIES AND PUT THEIR CLOTHES INSIDE A FIREPROOF CONTAINER INSIDE THE VEHICLE WHILE COLONEL BURTON WASN'T AROUND. ( yelling ) THE INSULTS THAT WERE TRADED THAT DAY DEFINITELY HAD NO BUSINESS SHOWING UP IN THE TEST REPORTS. THEY WERE OF COURSE DELETED FROM THE FINAL REPORT. ALL EXCEPT COLONEL BACH'S UNFORTUNATE REFERENCE TO COLONEL BURTON'S MOTHER. UNDERSTAND, TEMPERATURES WERE RUNNING HIGH. APPARENTLY INSIDE THE BRADLEY AS WELL. THERE'S A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED IN EVERY TEST. THAT'S THE POINT OF DOING TESTS. TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS. IF WE KNEW WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE WE WOULDN'T NEED TO DO THE TEST. AND, JUST BECAUSE THE TESTS DIDN'T ALWAYS COME OUT THE WAY COLONEL BURTON EXPECTED... IS NO REASON TO ASSUME ANYTHING DEVIOUS WAS GOING ON. ( female ) I ASKED YOU GENERAL, FILLING THE FUEL TANKS WITH WATER FOR A TEST DESIGNED TO CHECK THE COMBUSTIBILITY OF THOSE TANKS, THAT WASN'T DEVIOUS ?! IF THE TANKS HAD BEEN FILLED OF FUEL THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE VEHICLE WOULD'VE EXPLODED. ( male ) ISN'T THAT THE POINT ? IF THE VEHICLE HAD EXPLODED, WE COULDN'T HAVE RUN ADDITIONAL TESTS. I CAN'T ORDER UP AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF BRADLEYS JUST TO BLOW THEM UP ! UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE TELLING ME TO SPEND MORE MONEY WHICH I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU ARE. ( female ) GENERAL I BELIEVE THAT EFFORTS WERE MADE TO MAKE THE BRADLEY AMPHIBIOUS ?! YES, ALTHOUGH HOW THAT'S RELEVANT I FAIL TO COMPREHEND. ( male ) HOW MANY BRADLEYS WERE LOST DURING THAT EXPERIMENT ? LOST ? THE REPORT SAYS FOUR OF THE BRADLEYS SANK DURING TESTING. THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION. ( female ) IT'S NOT OPINION, GENERAL. FOUR OF THEM SANK. TECHNICALLY, YES. GENERAL, CAN WE GET BACK TO THE FUEL TANKS ? SERGEANT. HAVE THE TANKS ALWAYS BEEN FILLED WITH WATER ? NO, SIR. ONLY WHEN THE VEHICLE IS BEING TESTED SIR. WHAT ELSE DON'T I KNOW ? SERGEANT, I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION. WHAT ELSE DON'T I KNOW ABOUT THESE TESTS ? THE AMMUNITION STORED IN THE BRADLEY SIR. WHAT ABOUT IT ? SAND. THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE SIR. TELL ME-- DID THE TERM "COURT-MARTIAL" EVER ENTER ANYONE'S MIND HERE ? NO, SIR. REALLY, THAT'S TRULY AMAZING SERGEANT. HERE WE ARE WATCHING WATER DRIP OUT OF THE GAS TANKS AND SAND SPILL OUT OF THE AMMUNITION RIGHT AFTER A TEST WAS DONE TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE DAMN THING WAS SAFE ! NO ONE HERE EVEN THINKS OF THE TERM "COURT-MARTIAL" ?! WHY, IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING, IS THAT ? WE WERE UNDER ORDERS SIR. DO YOU THINK ACTING ON THOSE ORDERS IS CONSCIONABLE SERGEANT ? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK OR DO SIR, BECAUSE YOU DESK WARRIORS FROM WASHINGTON WILL SHOW UP AND FIND A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO MAKE THE TESTS TURN OUT WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT SIR. I'M NOT HERE TO MANIPULATE TEST RESULTS. I'M HERE TO LEARN THE TRUTH. YOU WANT THE TRUTH SIR ?! WE GET A NEW WHITE KNIGHT EVERY OTHER YEAR SIR. SOME GUY JUST LIKE YOU, AND YOU ALL START OUT THE SAME. BIG SPEECHES THAT TURN TO SHIT AFTER SIX MONTHS, WHEN YOUR NEXT PROMOTION COMES DUE. AND THEN IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL. WHERE DID YOU PICK UP THIS LOUSY ATTITUDE, SERGEANT ? RIGHT HERE, SIR, WATCHING GUYS LIKE YOU. WELL, I'M SORRY. I'M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT. 'CAUSE UNLIKE YOU, I TAKE MY JOB SERIOUSLY. REALLY ? WELL MAYBE, MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME, COLONEL, WHY THE BRADLEY HAS BEEN ORDERED INTO PRODUCTION BEFORE YOU HAVE DONE YOUR JOB ? DO YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT THIS IS ? 100 BRADLEYS HAVE BEEN ORDERED ? WE HAVE A SCHEDULE COLONEL BURTON. AND I'M NOT GONNA HAVE IT ON MY RECORD THAT THE BRADLEY FELL BEHIND SCHEDULE BECAUSE YOU'RE FUSSING OVER SOME GODAMN TESTS. THOSE GODAMN TESTS COULD SAVE LIVES. THE BRADLEY WILL SAVE LIVES COLONEL BY BRINGING MEN TO THE FRONT LINE WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA COLONEL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE MEN IF THE BRADLEY TAKES A HIT AND THE ALUMINUM BURNS ? I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE BRITISH STUDY COLONEL. AND IT IS BULLSHIT. THAT THING COULD BE A DEATH TRAP. SAYS WHO ? SAYS ME ! HOW DO YOU KNOW ? HAVE YOU PUT PEOPLE IN THERE DURING THE TEST ? NO, OF COURSE NOT. YOU DON'T KNOW COLONEL, ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING. AND UNTIL YOU DO, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS WASTING OUR TIME. ( female ) ARE YOU SUGGESTING COLONEL BURTON HAD NO REASON TO BE CONCERNED ? I AM SUGGESTING THAT COLONEL BURTON AND HIS TESTS DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING WE DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW. EXCEPT HIS OWN PENCHANT FOR THEATRICS. ( male ) THEATRICS GENERAL ? YES, THEATRICS, CHEAP THEATRICS AT THAT. SO BILLY, NOW THE LITTLE PRICK HAS ISSUED A MEMO THAT STIPULATES FOR THE TESTS, HE'D LIKE TO USE SHEEP. JESUS, WE ALREADY STARTED WORK ON THE CHASSIS ASSEMBLY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. 'CAUSE IF THE SHEEP COME OUT OF THIS TITS UP, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STOP PRODUCTION. THERE ARE WAYS AROUND IT. ABSOLUTELY. LIKE WHAT ? WE COULD SIC ANIMAL RIGHTS PEOPLE ON HIM. IT IS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OF SHEEP. RACK OF LAMB. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE ME. ( phone ) YES. ( Fanning ) Major Sayers just called sir. UH-HUH, WHEN DO THEY PLAN TO RUN THE TESTS ? Immediately, just as soon as we send over the sheep. "WE" ? I THOUGHT THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF THE SHEEP. THEY SAY IT'S BEING HANDLED AT OUR END. THE SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE. WHAT DOES THE SURGEON GENERAL HAVE TO DO WITH SHEEP ? EXCUSE ME. YOU MUST BE COLONEL BURTON. WE WERE TOLD YOU MIGHT SHOW UP. WHO TOLD YOU THAT ? COLONEL BACH, HE ESTABLISHED THIS OFFICE LAST WEEK WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S TRYING TO KILL THE BRADLEY. WHO TOLD YOU THAT ? I'M SORRY SIR, ALL INFORMATION IN THIS OFFICE IS CLASSIFIED. SO, WHAT IS "RUMINANT PROCUREMENT" ANYWAY ? THAT'S WHAT THIS OFFICE HAS BEEN CREATED TO DO. YEAH, BUT WHAT IS IT ? THE ANALYSIS AND POLICY DETERMINATION FOR THE PERIMETERS ABOUT WHICH WOULD BE TENDERED RESEARCH DATA ON THE OPTIMAL TEST RUMINANT. SUCH RUMINANTS ARE TO BE... YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SHEEP. YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF BUYING SHEEP, CORRECT ? WE CAN'T JUST GO OUT AND BUY SHEEP, SIR. WHY NOT ? WE'RE DOING A VAPORIFICS TEST ON SHEEP... VAPORIFICS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A WAR HEAD PENETRATES ARMOR. THE METAL PARTICLES VAPORIZE AND FORM A LARGE FIREBALL... LIEUTENANT, I KNOW WHAT A VAPORIFICS TEST IS. I'M THE ONE WHO CALLED FOR IT. THEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE SHEEP SPECS BEFORE WE CAN PROCEED. SHEEP "SPECS", WHAT IS SHEEP SPECS ? SPECIFICATIONS ! SHORN OR UN-SHORN, RAMS, EWES, LAMBS, SHORT HAIR... BIG HORNS OR DOMESTIC... OR BIG HORN UN-SHORN ! JUST, HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO GET YOUR SHEEP SPECS ? NOT LONG AT ALL, SIX, EIGHT MONTHS, TOPS. THEN WE'LL GO AND TENDER ALL THE RESEARCH DATA. BUT THEN WE'LL REQUIRE ANOTHER EIGHT MONTHS TO EVALUATE THE DATA. AFTER WHICH WE CAN MOVE IT INTO... HOW MUCH ? WELL... ALRIGHT, BRING IT BACK. KEEP IT COMING, KEEP IT COMING... A LITTLE MORE, LITTLE MORE... WHOA ! SIR, COLONEL BACH IS ON HIS WAY OVER HERE SIR. I'M SURE HE IS. FOR YOUR INFORMATION SIR, IT SOUNDED LIKE A WORLD CLASS SHIT-FIT SIR. I'M SURE IT DID SERGEANT. ( horn honking ) COME ON, LET'S MOVE IT OUT. ( Sayers ) WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE SHEEP DOING HERE ? ( Burton ) I BOUGHT THEM. ( Bach ) YOU CAN'T DO THAT ! WELL I DID. THERE ARE NO SHEEP SPECS COLONEL ! I'VE ALREADY DEVISED THE SHEEP SPECS MAJOR. WHAT ARE THEY ? THEY'RE LIVE AND KICKING, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. TESTING IS A SCIENCE, COLONEL. EVERY TEST HAS TO BE A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT. JUST STICKING A HERD OF SHEEP INTO A.... FINE, YOU DON'T WANT SHEEP ? LENNON, CHAVEZ, GET THE SHEEP OUT OF THERE, AND GET IN THE BRADLEY. GET IN THE BRADLEY. SIR ? I NEED A VAPORIFICS TEST, GET IN THE BRADLEY. EVERYONE IN THE BRADLEY. ( Bach ) ARE YOU TOTALLY OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND ?! ( Burton ) YOU THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF A JOKE, COLONEL ? WELL LET'S SEE. ALRIGHT, WE'LL JUST USE THE SHEEP. THAT'S A TERRIFIC IDEA. WE'LL USE THE SHEEP IN THE BRADLEY. GO ON SHEEP, IN THE BRADLEY. GODAMMIT ! BACKBLAST AREA, CLEAR ! ON THE WAY SIR. FIRE ! ( gasping ) OH GOD, GRANGER DON'T BREATHE ! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ? THE DAMN FUMES ! STAY BACK ! HOW ARE YOU DOING ? I'M OKAY. JESUS, JUST ONE TINY WHIFF... DID YOU GET A LOOK INSIDE ? NOTHING COULD HAVE SURVIVED THOSE FUMES. SERGEANT, WHERE ARE THE SHEEP ? MAJOR SAYERS SAID THEY HAVE TO GO IN THE INCINERATOR. WHAT ?! THEY JUST CARTED THEM AWAY SIR. NO, STOP, STOP ! FOLLOW THOSE SHEEP ! SIR ? STOP THAT TRUCK, THAT'S AN ORDER ! YES, SIR. SERGEANT. I NEED THEM, FOR AUTOPSY. TO VERIFY TEST RESULTS. I SEE HIM, WE GOT HIM SIR. ( sirens ) PAY NO ATTENTION TO THEM ! SIR ? CONCENTRATE ON THE SHEEP. LOOK OUT ! MOVE IT ! COME ON, COME ON ! ( sirens ) DAMMIT, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU STOPPING US FOR ?! STOP THE SHEEP ! WHAT'S THE HURRY SIR ? NOT ONE OF THE TESTS I'VE ORDERED HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO PLAN. AND SINCE MY JOB... YOUR JOB IS TO STOP WINING AND SERVE THE UNITED STATES AS BEFITS AN OFFICER ! MY JOB, GENERAL, IS TO OVERSEE THE JOINT LIVE-FIRE TEST PROGRAM AND DELIVER A REPORT ON MY FINDINGS TO CONGRESS. IN ORDER TO DO THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO INSIST ON A LIVE-FIRE TEST OF THE BRADLEY UNDER COMBAT CONDITIONS. NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU FUCKING FLY-BOY, YOU DON'T KNOW JACK-SHIT ABOUT COMBAT ! I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS FOR A SOLDIER TO DIE IN THAT VEHICLE SIR. DON'T YOU PREACH TO ME YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH ! I WANT A REALISTIC TEST. THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO GET THEM... PEOPLE FIRST , VEHICLES SECOND !! THOSE ARE MY PRIORITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE ARMY'S PRIORITIES SEEM TO BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE. YOU ARE WAY OUT OF LINE HERE. I WON'T SIGN OFF ON THE BRADLEY WITHOUT A LIVE-FIRE TEST. Sir ? WHO IS BURTON'S COMMANDING OFFICER ? General DeGrasso, sir. GET HIM FOR ME. IT'S AN ECONOMIC MOVE COLONEL, DEPARTMENT-WIDE, YOU'RE BEING REASSIGNED. IN THE MEANTIME SHOULD I, SHOULD I CONTINUE IN MY PRESENT ASSIGNMENT ? YOUR PRESENT ASSIGNMENT HAS BEEN ELIMINATED COLONEL. I DIDN'T THINK MY JOB COULD BE ELIMINATED. I WAS APPOINTED BY CONGRESS. BUT YOU'RE PAID BY THE ARMY. IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD YOU AND THEY CAN'T, YOU HAVE NO JOB. COLONEL IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. LET'S NOT LET THIS LITTLE BLIP ON THE SCREEN GROUND YOU PERMANENTLY. WOULD THE COLONEL EVER CONSIDERED HAVING A DRINK WITH AN ENLISTED SOLDIER ? DOES THE ENLISTED SOLDIER THINK THE COLONEL NEEDS ONE ? WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO, FIRE YOU ? OKAY, JUST A LITTLE ONE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY IRONIC ? GENERAL OMAR BRADLEY WAS A BRILLIANT TACTICIAN, AND A GREAT LEADER. NO EGO, JUST DID THE JOB. AND HE LOOKED OUT FOR THE MORALE AND THE SAFETY OF HIS MEN. AND THEY GO AND PUT HIS NAME ON THIS THING ! TALK ABOUT A KICK IN THE ASS. THE CLOSEST THE BRASS EVER GET TO A BATTLEFIELD IS THE FIRST TEE ON A SATURDAY MORNING. YOU KNOW, FANNING... I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE PENTAGON IS NOT A CHARITY, IT'S CASH FLOWS AND EGOS. THAT'S PART OF IT, IT'S WHAT HELPS DRIVE IT, FINE, BUT... SOMEHOW... I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE MEN CAME FIRST. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE PEOPLE ON TOP KNEW THAT IT WAS ABOUT THE SOLDIER IN THE FIELD. YOU GAVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT. DID I ? YES SIR, YOU DID. WELL, NOW IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM. MY PROBLEM IS SALVAGING MY CAREER. WHICH APPARENTLY IS NOT BEYOND REPAIR. I'M A GOOD LITTLE BOY. SO, THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. THE MAN SAID, "WAR IS HELL". HE SHOULD HAVE TRIED PEACETIME. YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU ? NO, BE MY GUEST. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT WASTE. ( phone ) BURTON. So they're moving you out ? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT ? WELL... HOW FAR ARE YOU WILLING TO GO WITH THIS THING ? THE QUESTION IS-- HOW FAR ARE THEY GOING TO SEND ME ? I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A TRIP TO CALIFORNIA THIS WEEKEND. I'M NOT UP FOR A VACATION RIGHT NOW. NO ONE GOES TO FRESNO FOR A VACATION, COLONEL. CAN I HELP YOU SIR, I.D. PLEASE. COLONEL BURTON. I'M HERE TO SEE THE PROJECT MANAGER. COLONEL BURTON ? YES. STEVE JOHNSON, PROJECT MANAGER. HI, THANK YOU. ( foreman ) ALL SET, LET'S GO ! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE ? WHO CHANGED THE SPECS ? THE ISRAELIS. THE ISRAELIS, WHEN ? WHEN THEY PLACED THEIR ORDER. SO THESE ARE FOR EXPORT. YES. ALL OF THEM ? YES COLONEL. YOU'RE TELLING ME WE'RE MANUFACTURING TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS VEHICLE ? THE ISRAELIS WOULDN'T TAKE THE BRADLEY AS DESIGNED, COLONEL. THEY WANTED THE FUEL TANKS ON THE OUTSIDE. REINFORCED ARMOR... ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. WHAT ABOUT THE SPECS FOR OUR BRADLEYS ? EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES YOU'RE TESTING COLONEL. NO CHANGE. YOU THINK YOU YOU WERE FOLLOWED ? FOLLOWED ? I DROVE AROUND FOR HOURS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE ARE. MAYBE YOU PREFER TO MEET AT THE OFFICER'S CLUB ? SO WHEN DID THE ISRAELIS TEST IT ? THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TEST IT. THEY KNEW BY LOOKING AT IT IT WAS A DEATH TRAP. SO WHILE WE'RE SENDING OUR GUYS OFF TO DIE, THE PENTAGON BRASS IS REDESIGNING THE DAMN THING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE ?! THEY CAN'T SELL IT OVERSEAS LIKE IT IS. BUSINESS AS USUAL. MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO KEEP FIGHTING THE BASTARDS ? I'VE LOST MY JOB GENERAL. THEY'RE MOVING ME OUT. SO, THEY'RE MOVING YOU OUT, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DISCHARGED. WORK FROM INSIDE, FROM WHEREVER IT IS THEY SEND YOU. AND TURN INTO YOU ? PASSING ANONYMOUS NOTES AND MEETING IN PARKING LOTS ? YOU'RE GREAT AT SITTING IN THE SHADOWS AND TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO. WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF YOUR ASS AND DO SOMETHING ?! I CAN'T. HELP ME ! I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT I CAN. I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS BATTLE FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. I'M NOT GONNA GO TO THE MAT OVER THIS ! I'VE GOT TOO MUCH TO LOSE. 70,000 TROOPS, 70,000 AMERICAN BOYS WILL RIDE INTO BATTLE IN THE BRADLEY IF AMERICA FIGHTS ANOTHER WAR. WE CAN'T BE APART OF SENDING THEM TO THEIR DEATHS. ONE CALL. WHAT ? ONE CALL. I'LL MAKE ONE CALL AND THAT'S IT. SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN. GENERAL PARTRIDGE, YOU'VE READ TODAY'S WASHINGTON POST ? I HAVE MR. SECRETARY. AND I TAKE IT YOU'VE SEEN THE STORY, ATTRIBUTED TO A HIGHLY PLACED PENTAGON SOURCE. YES I HAVE SIR, AND MAY I SAY THAT I'M AS DEEPLY DISTRESSED AS YOU THAT ANYONE IN THE PENTAGON WOULD STOOP SO LOW. LEAKS WITHIN THE PENTAGON GENERAL ARE HOW I GET MOST OF MY INFORMATION. MR. SECRETARY, ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE PENTAGON IS LESS THAN FORTHCOMING ? LESS THAN FORTHCOMING GENERAL ?! THEN PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I HAVE TO LEARN FROM THE PRESS THAT THE MAN IN CHARGE OF TESTING THE BRADLEY HAS BEEN FIRED ? HE WASN'T FIRED SIR, HE WAS REASSIGNED. BY WHOM ? BY GENERAL DeGRASSO, HIS COMMANDING OFFICER. I'M AS SHOCKED AS YOU ARE. MY GUESS IS THAT THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE... THAT'S THE SORT OF TROUBLE YOU ALWAYS GET WITH THESE CROSS DEPARTMENTAL JOINT-TESTING PROGRAMS. ( phone ) YES. Congressman Stratton is on the phone. SAM, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ? WHAT ARTICLE ? OH, THAT ARTICLE. NO, COMPLETELY UNTRUE, INTEROFFICE SNAFU. FILE IT UNDER CREATIVE JOURNALISM. I'M LOOKING INTO IT NOW, YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW. RIGHT, RIGHT. MY BEST TO ELLEN. GENERAL, I WANT A FULL UPDATE ON THE BRADLEY AND I WANT IT IN WRITING. RIGHT AWAY SIR. THAT IS THE LAST CALL I EXPECT TO RECEIVE ON THIS MATTER, FROM CONGRESSMEN STRATTON OR ANYONE ELSE ON THE HILL. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR, GENERAL ? PERFECTLY. ( knock ) COLONEL BURTON, I WANT YOU TO WRITE YOUR REPORT ON THE BRADLEY. SIR ? I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MY JOB HAD BEEN... YOUR JOB HAS BEEN REINSTATED. I WANT YOUR REPORT ON MY DESK BY 1800 HOURS. YES SIR. COLONEL, IN CASE YOU ARE UNAWARE, AS PER THE MILITARY MANUAL, YOU'LL DELIVER YOUR REPORT TO ME AND TO ME ALONE. SHOULD SO MUCH AS A SINGLE COPY OF YOUR REPORT BE MADE PUBLIC, I WILL BRING YOU UP ON CHARGES OF WILLFUL SUBVERSION OF MILITARY PROCEDURE AND HAVE YOU COURT-MARTIALED. STOP PACKING, WE'RE STAYING. WE'RE STAYING, HOW'D YOU DO THAT ? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. DO WE HAVE A RULE BOOK ? A RULE BOOK SIR ? YOU KNOW A BOOK WITH RULES IN IT. WHAT DO YOU NEED A RULE BOOK FOR ? I'M PLAYING BY THE RULES, 'CAUSE I ALWAYS PLAY BY THE RULES. HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING BY THE RULES IF YOU NEED A RULE BOOK TO TELL YOU WHAT THE RULES ARE ?! I NEED A RULE BOOK TO TELL ME... JUST GET ME THE BOOK. ( typing ) YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE SIR ? CHINESE FOOD, NO-DOZE ? NO THANK YOU SERGEANT, I'M FINE. WELL THEN, 'NIGHT SIR. WHAT SOUNDS BETTER ? "THE BRADLEY HAS SO FAR FAILED VIRTUALLY EVERY TEST OR "THE TESTING PROGRAM OF THE BRADLEY "HAS BEEN WITHOUT ANY COHERENT STANDARDS." THEY BOTH SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THE GENERAL WOULDN'T WANT IN HIS REPORT. THIS IS NOT JUST A REPORT, IT'S A DEADLY WEAPON. SIR, AN M-16 IS A DEADLY WEAPON. A REPORT IS JUST A PILE OF PAPER UNLESS YOU PLAN TO INFLICT A LOT OF EXTREMELY VICIOUS PAPER CUTS. GO HOME, SERGEANT. GOODNIGHT SIR. "THE FAILURE OF THE BRADLEY "TO INCORPORATE EVEN THE MOST ELEMENTARY SAFEGUARDS "TO PROTECT THE TROOPS INSIDE "RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY." "AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE VAPORIFICS TESTS "WERE CARRIED OUT SUGGESTS EITHER NEGLIGENCE "OR A FAILURE IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND." "HAD ANY TROOPS BEEN INSIDE THE VEHICLE, "AS IT IS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED, "THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED EITHER BY TOXIC FUMES, "FLAMES, OR BY THE OVERPRESSURE CREATED "BY THE EXPANDING GAS IN THE COMPARTMENT." "AND AS A RESULT OF MANIFEST DEFICIENCIES "IN EVERY AREA, THIS OFFICE... "... AS A RESULT OF MANIFEST DEFICIENCIES... "... IS ADVISING THE IMMEDIATE NECESSITY "OF LIVE FIRE-TESTING UNDER COMBAT CONDITIONS !" REWRITE IT ! SIR ? REWRITE THE FUCKING PIECE OF GARBAGE SO IT SMELLS LIKE A ROSE ! JESUS CHRIST ! "THE BRADLEY TEST STANDARDS "HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY ALTERED IN EXTREME WAYS. "THE BRADLEY TESTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY CONSISTENT. "THEY HAVE ALTERED THE STANDARDS FOR TESTING. "TEST AFTER TEST HAS REVEALED DESIGN FLAWS "IN THE BRADLEY. "THE MARGINALIZED OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE "SUGGESTS NO VAPORIFIC SHIFT AT THIS TIME." THAT'S BRILLIANT LIEUTENANT, THAT'S ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY BRILLIANT. THANK YOU SIR. BUT SIR. WHAT ? WHAT DOES IT MEAN ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN ? YOU WROTE IT ! GOOD AFTERNOON. "THE BRADLEY TESTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY CONSISTENT, "THEY HAVE ALTERED THE STANDARDS FOR TESTING..." HAVE YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS THING ? IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WROTE. HOW CAN THEY DO THAT ? THEY'RE PLAYING BY THE BOOK SERGEANT AND SO AM I. PAPER CUTS... ... VICIOUS PAPER CUTS. "THE CHARACTERIZATION IN YOUR REPORT "IS AT BEST SERIOUS MISUNDERSTANDING "OF THE TESTING PROCEDURES ON A VEHICLE "AS FLAWED AS THE BRADLEY. "AS NOTED IN MY ORIGINAL REPORT, "THE INTEGRITY... JESUS CHRIST ! WHO DID THIS FUCKING THING GO TO ? THE DISTRIBUTION PAGE LISTED 198 NAMES. COURT MARTIAL THE SON-OF-A-BITCH ! LOCK HIM UP NOW ! WE CAN'T. WE SURE AS HELL CAN ! ( Sayers ) BURTON'S PLAYING BY THE BOOK. HIS REPORT WAS CLASSIFIED, IT WAS SENT TO YOU, YOU REVISED IT AND SENT IT BACK TO HIM. HE WROTE A MEMO ON YOUR REVISION WHICH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS, CAN BE SENT TO ANYONE REMOTELY INVOLVED, WITH THE BRADLEY. IN THIS CASE, 198 PEOPLE. I WILL FUCKING KILL HIM. I WILL FILET HIM, I WILL DRAWER AND QUARTER HIM, I WILL STICK HIS HEAD IN A VICE. WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM SIR. IT'S BY THE BOOK. THEN YOU FIND ME SOMETHING IN THAT GODAMN BOOK THAT WILL HELP ME FRY THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH ! WHAT ?! SIR, THE WASHINGTON POST IS ON THE PHONE. THAT WAS FAST. LEAKS DON'T USUALLY GET TO THEM 'TIL AFTER LUNCH. ( Fanning ) YES, NO, WE CANNOT COMMENT ON THAT RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU. YES... NO, HE CANNOT COMMENT. I'M SORRY, BUT UNDER MILITARY RULES, I'M UNABLE TO COMMENT. I CAN'T COMMENT. NO, NO, NO COMMENT. SORRY, BYE. I'M GETTING LOCKJAW FROM NOT SAYING ANYTHING. ( phone ) BURTON. I CAN'T COMMENT. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN COMMENT ON ? WELL YES. I'VE JUST RECEIVED ORDERS I AM TO REPORT FOR DUTY IN ALASKA. ALASKA IS A PRESTIGE POSTING SENATOR. NO, NO, NO, I ASSURE YOU THAT MEMO OF HIS HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS BEING TRANSFERRED. OH SENATOR, I'M SORRY, I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT SECRETARY WEINBERGER IS ON THE OTHER LINE. YES, I'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU. I PROMISE, THANK YOU. SIR, BEFORE YOU PICK UP, WEINBERGER IS ON TWO, LINE ONE IS THE TIMES. LINE THREE IS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, LINE FOUR IS NEWSWEEK, LINE FIVE IS THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, WHAT DO THEY WANT ? HEARINGS SIR. ON THE BRADLEY. ( yelling ) ( gavel pounding ) ALASKA ? WHAT ? I SAID ALASKA, GENERAL. AS I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS MADAM CHAIRMAN, A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO CREATE TEAMWORK. GOOD OLD-FASHIONED TEAMWORK. YES, YOU TOLD US, GENERAL. AND COLONEL BURTON'S NOT A TEAM PLAYER, HE'S A ROGUE OPERATOR. I'M NOT A NAME-CALLER MADAM CHAIRMAN. BUT IF YOU WISH TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION, THAT WOULD BE YOUR CHOICE NOT MINE. DID YOU EVER SAY TO COLONEL BURTON "IF I GET ONE MORE CALL FROM THE HILL "ABOUT YOUR EXPLETIVE DELETED REPORTS, "YOU'LL BE SITTING ON YOUR BRAINS ?" DOES THAT SOUND LIKE ME SIR ? JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION GENERAL PLEASE. I DON'T REMEMBER SAYING IT. NOT THAT I WASN'T PROVOKED. TWO WITNESSES TESTIFIED YOU SAID THOSE EXACT WORDS TO COLONEL BURTON OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON PHARMACY. I HAVE VISITED THE PHARMACY. QUITE A BIT LATELY FOR ANTACIDS. BUT I WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO ANYONE. LET ALONE A FELLOW OFFICER. BUT YOU MAKE NO SECRET OF YOUR ANTAGONISM TOWARDS COLONEL BURTON. IT'S HIS REPORT I DON'T APPROVE OF. ( Partridge ) COLONEL BURTON'S REPORT IS MALICIOUS, MISINFORMED, AND ACCUSATORY. AND I HAVE NO USE FOR AN OFFICER WHO IS MORE INTERESTED IN GRABBING HEADLINES THEN HE IS IN DEFENDING THIS COUNTRY. MADAM CHAIRMAN, COLONEL BURTON'S HERE. AT THIS TIME THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO CALL AS WITNESS COLONEL JAMES G. BURTON, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. MADAM CHAIRMAN. YES GENERAL. AS YOU MUST KNOW, UNDER THE RULES OF MILITARY CONDUCT, NO MAN CAN APPEAR AT THESE HEARINGS WITHOUT THE EXPRESS ORDER OF HIS COMMANDING OFFICER. UNFORTUNATELY, GENERAL DeGRASSO IS ON A FACT-FINDING TOUR OF OUR BASES IN GERMANY. I DON'T BELIEVE GENERAL DeGRASSO HAS GIVEN ANY ORDER FOR COLONEL BURTON TO TESTIFY. YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT GENERAL, BUT AS COLONEL BURTON HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO ALASKA, HE'S NO LONGER UNDER GENERAL DeGRASSO'S COMMAND. AM I CORRECT ? ( Chairwoman ) DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP YOU GOD ? I DO. LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE STIRRED UP A HORNET'S NEST COLONEL. IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION MA'AM. WHAT WAS YOUR INTENTION ? SIMPLY TO DO THE JOB I WAS ASSIGNED TO DO. ( Burton ) THE ARMY TEST REPORTS DO NOT MAKE THE POSSIBILITY OF CASUALTIES A TOP PRIORITY. IN FACT, GENERAL PARTRIDGE'S REPORT ON THE BRADLEY DOESN'T EVEN MENTION THE WORD CASUALTY, NOT ONCE. I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHAT WAS REQUIRED WAS A LIVE-FIRE TEST. I REQUESTED SUCH A TEST, REPEATEDLY. DID YOU GET THAT TEST ? NO MA'AM, I DID NOT. WHY NOT ? I WANTED MORE REALISM THAN ARMY TESTING WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PROVIDING. YOU WANT REALISM ?! ( gavel pounding ) ( chairwoman ) GENERAL, YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER ! MADAM CHAIRMAN, IN THE INTEREST OF RESOLVING SOME OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED HERE TODAY, I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING. PLEASE BE BRIEF GENERAL. OF COURSE. COLONEL BURTON WANTS MORE REALISM, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT REAL WORLD FOR A MOMENT. THE REAL WORLD HAS ENEMIES IN IT. THERE ARE FORCES AT WORK. EVEN NOW AS WE SPEAK. WITH ONE OBJECTIVE IN MIND-- THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS COUNTRY. WE MUST NOT, WE WILL NOT ALLOW THOSE FORCES TO PREVAIL, FOR IF WE DO, YOU CAN BE CERTAIN THAT YOU AND I, AND EVERYONE ELSE WILL NEVER AGAIN ENJOY THE LUXURY OF MEETING IN THIS BUILDING TO DEBATE ANYTHING ! AS I SAID ON THE OUTSET, WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF WINNING. THAT TAKES TEAMWORK. GENERAL THE TEAMWORK YOU SO PRIZE, I TAKE IT IT WAS IN FULL FORCE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE ? TEXTBOOK. PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO TELL US HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPENT SO FAR TO DEVELOP THE BRADLEY ? HOW MUCH ? WELL, YOU HAVE THE FIGURES DON'T YOU ? OF COURSE. FOURTEEN. MORE OR LESS. FOURTEEN ? FOURTEEN. MILLION ? ( mumbling ) BILLION... WHAT DID YOU SAY GENERAL ? BILLION. ( gallery chatter ) BILLION... WITH A "B" ? WITH A "B". 14 BILLION DOLLARS FOR DESIGNING ONE ARMORED VEHICLE ? THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY. WE ARE ALL TAXPAYERS AFTER ALL. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. GENERAL, HOW MANY YEARS HAS THIS PROGRAM BEEN RUNNING ? BEAR WITH ME, JUST A MOMENT. LET ME... ... TWELVE, FIFTEEN, SEVENTEEN... WHAT ? SEVENTEEN. WHICH IS EVIDENCE OF THE ENORMOUS CARE MY TEAM TAKES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY WEAPONS SYSTEM UNDERTAKEN BY THE PENTAGON. ( sighing ) UH... SEVENTEEN YEARS. 14 BILLION DOLLARS OF THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY. GENERAL, I THINK IT'S TIME THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GETS THE LIVE-FIRE TEST THAT COLONEL BURTON WANTS. TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY SIR. UH-HUH. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. EVERY DAMN ONE OF THESE NUTS AND BOLTS HAS BEFORE TAKEN OFF AND PUT BACK ON AGAIN. THIS WOULDN'T BE FLAME RETARDANT, WOULD IT ? YOU THINK THEY MADE THE MEN TRICK THIS WHOLE THING UP ? IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME. NOT A BIT. ROOM ATTENTION. AT EASE GENTLEMEN. LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HARD. CORPORAL. SIR ? LET ME HAVE ONE OF THOSE M-16s. I WANNA TELL YOU A STORY. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT SERGEANT ? NO SIR. ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WENT TO THE VETERANS HOSPITAL TO VISIT A FRIEND OF MINE FROM MY FLYING DAYS. ONLY I TOOK A WRONG TURN WHEN I GOT OFF THE ELEVATOR. NOW WHEN I LOOK BACK ON IT, I THINK I WAS MEANT TO GO DOWN THAT CORRIDOR. 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE I MET PHIL. THANK YOU CORPORAL. BUT SIR... LET ME FINISH DALTON. I WANT TO PASS ON SOMETHING I LEARNED ABOUT THE M-16 FROM PHIL. YOU ALL KNOW THE M-16 BETTER THAN I DO. A LOT OF YOU USED IT IN VIETNAM. BUT YOU WERE LUCKY. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THAT WAR THEY SENT GUYS OFF TO FIGHT WITH M-16s THAT JAMMED DURING COMBAT. A LITTLE DUST, A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN, AND THE GUN WAS USELESS. MAYBE THOSE EARLY M-16s WEREN'T TESTED PROPERLY. MAYBE SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT A PRODUCTION SCHEDULE OR A PROMOTION, THAN HE WAS ABOUT THOSE GRUNTS IN SOME FAR AWAY JUNGLE, WHO MIGHT END UP WITH THEIR STOMACHS IN THEIR HANDS. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT HAPPENED TO, DO YOU ? NO... I'M SURE NOT. OTHERWISE YOU'D BE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW MAKING SURE THAT BRADLEY IS EXACTLY, I MEAN EXACTLY THE WAY IT WOULD BE UNDER NORMAL COMBAT CONDITIONS. WITH SOME OF YOUR BUDDIES RIDING INSIDE, GUYS LIKE PHIL. ONLY PHIL HAS BEEN IN A COMA FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. SINCE THE DAY HIS M-16 JAMMED SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF PEHN LOA. BUT HELL, YOU DON'T KNOW THE GUY. OR ANYBODY LIKE HIM. RIGHT ? ( chatter ) GOOD MORNING SIR. EVERYTHING ALRIGHT ? OH FINE SIR, JUST FINE. KEEP COMING, KEEP COMING... KEEP COMING, A LITTLE MORE. KEEP COMING. SERGEANT. SIR. EVERYTHING ALRIGHT SERGEANT ? FINE SIR.
