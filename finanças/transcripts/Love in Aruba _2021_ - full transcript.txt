(calm music) (upbeat music) - How many do we have to meet today? - We have five today. But I promise not to drag out the interviews, okay? - [Jackie] Mr. Garrett? - Jackie, please. So, based on your resume, you've done this for quite a while, being a nanny. - I've worked with children from 25 families. - Wow, that's a lot. I'm sure you have many stories to tell. - I guard my clients' privacy. - Uh, okay. Good. Tell me about your schedule. - I have the whole summer open. The fall too. Really, anytime. I haven't worked in a while, so I'm all yours. - Do you have a valid passport? - No, it got taken away. But I can get my hands on one. It might take a few days though. - So let's talk about your other work experience. Looks like you substitute teach? Among other things you have listed? - Yes, I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Anything to help pay the bills. Is there any way I could get an advance on what I'd be earning? - So how about I tell you about Macey? - Oh, I love that name! My friend has a cat named Macey. Here. I have a photo, cutest thing ever. If I can just find my phone. I'd lose my head if it wasn't, you know, connected. - Listen, we've interviewed a lot of people. How about we get back to you? - Oh, great, okay. - It was good meeting you. - And you. And you, Mary! - Oh, your keys. - (laughs) I told you. Talk to you soon. - That's a no for me. - Me too. - Another year over. - Yep. - Are you relieved? - This group of kids were so sweet. I'm gonna miss them. - Yeah, you say that every year. And then you worry what your next group of fourth graders will be like. - Everyone has new school year jitters. - Well, you can put that behind you. So, what do you have planned this summer? Oh, that trip with your old college friends? - No, actually. Half of them had other plans come up, so we're postponing. Maybe we can go over Thanksgiving or something. - I'm sorry, Amber. I know you were looking forward to that. Well, if you want to get away, Rob and I were talking about you as a potential summer tutor for someone we know. - Really? Who? - So it's Rob's boss's son. He's traveling overseas and needs someone to help with his daughter. - Huh. Well, I've never taught outside the classroom. - How hard can it be? I think his daughter is like 10 years old. That's still fourth grade, right? - Yeah. - I guess he's had a hard time finding someone. Not the right fit type of thing. Rob heard he's interviewed like 15 people already. - Sounds like he's picky. - It's his child. I can't blame him. Hey, maybe you'd set him at ease, since there's a connection. - Yeah, I'm his dad's employee's wife's sister. Instant connection. - Okay, well, it's better than nothing. - I don't know. I'm in a career where it's perfectly acceptable to take the whole summer off. It's the one perk. - The trip is to Aruba or Antigua? I don't know, some island that begins with an A. Sounds like a fun perk to me. Want me to set up a meeting? - Sure. - Cut that for you? - No, you'll steal a bite. - [Connor] I wouldn't do that. (Macey laughs) - Excuse me, are you Mr. Garrett? - You can call me Connor. This is Macey. - Hi, I'm Amber. - Hi! - Have a seat. Can I get you anything? - No, thank you though. - So I've heard a lot about you from my father, or I guess maybe your brother? - Brother-in-law, yeah. - So do you teach fourth grade? - Yes, I do. What grade are you in, Macey? - I'll be in fifth grade. - Oh, that will be exciting. - Do you teach at Oak Lake Elementary? - No, at Parrish Heights, it's about 30 minutes away. I wasn't sure if you'd want this, resume. - Oh, thanks. So I have to be in Aruba for a couple of months. I thought with it being summer, I'd take Macey with me. I just need someone to look after her while I'm at work. - Oh, I thought you were looking for a tutor. - Oh, that too. I mean, I want Macey to learn something over the summer, you know, keep her schooling fresh, make sure she's not watching TV all day. - I just don't have any experience as a nanny. I really am a teacher. Is that okay? - Um. - What's your favorite animal? - [Connor] Macey. - Turtle. What's yours? - Penguin. - Nice choice. Are you excited to go to Aruba? - Yep. I get to go on one of Daddy's trips. - That's cool. You travel a lot then? - A few times a year, usually short trips. Normally, my parents watch Macey but I didn't want to be away from her that long. So I've never hired anybody to do this before. - What do you do for work? - I work for a wind power company. Yeah, we're looking to expand the wind power capabilities in Aruba. - That sounds interesting. - I'm not exactly sure about that but it gets me to Aruba, right? (Amber laughs) So we booked a rental home for our time there, so you'd get a room of your own. And I haven't looked into what there is to do in Aruba, but I'm sure there's good options for Macey to keep her occupied while I'm at work. - Yeah, certainly. - Well, we leave early next week. If we move forward with this, would that work for you? - Probably. I'd need to figure out a few things still. - Okay. Well, let's sleep on it and then we'll talk tomorrow. - Yeah, sounds good. Thank you. - Okay. Call me if you have any questions. - I will. Nice to meet you, Macey. - See you later. - What do you think? Yeah? - Yeah. - [Amber] So the principal from the school called today. - [Candice] Oh? - They got a call for a reference from Connor Garrett. They thought I was quitting. - Well, that's good. That means he's considering you. - Yeah, I just wasn't expecting that, you know? It seems more official. - Of course he's going to check up on you though. What did you think of him and his daughter? - They seem fine. And she's a fun girl, I can tell. Is there no mother to help? - Rob's under the impression they split up. Did he... Connor, right? Did he not say? - No. - So are you going to take it? - I want to, but... I'm used to having kids during the day and then having a break. I'm not sure what to expect. - You think she'll be a handful? - No, it's just, it's new. And what about you? If I'm gone... - I'll be fine. I'll swing by your place, pick up your mail, and make sure everything is okay. - That's not what I meant. I want to be here for you and the baby. - Well, you can fly home for a couple days. I'll have Rob, and Rob's parents, and Dad will be around too. Come on. This could be a new experience for you. A chance to, you know, see the world, do something different, get away from the normal routine. It's not like you want to be stuck around here all summer. You do want to go, right? - Yeah, I do. But I shouldn't get my hopes up, you know? He hasn't even called and... (phone ringing) - (gasps) Is that him? Fingers crossed! - Hello, this is Amber. Hi, yeah, good to hear from you. Oh, thank you, yeah, that's wonderful. I'd love to go. (upbeat music) - Here we are! - You said it has a pool, right? - Two pools, actually. - Wow! - [Connor] So what do you think? - It's awesome! Dad, check out the backyard. Whoa, this is so cool! - It is cool. Keep going. There should be a... Yeah, over here. Look. - Wow! - You know what, there's also this huge public beach just minutes from here. - Cool! - Yeah. - Can I go check it out? - Yeah, go ahead. - [Tony] Hello, anyone here? - Tony! What's up, buddy? Hey, it's good to see you. - You too, brother. How was your flight? - Oh, well, I'll tell you, I'll sleep well tonight. - I said that a month ago. - (laughs) All right. - Oh, Shauna sent some groceries so you guys don't have to starve tonight. - How nice is that? You thank her for me, would you? - No problem. - Hi, Tony. - Hello, Macey. Are you ready for an awesome summer? - Yep. - Me too. - Amber, this is Tony. Tony comes ahead to start the projects. - I didn't know you were dating. - Oh, no, no, this is Amber. She's just here to watch Macey while I'm working. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Well, I'll leave you all to it. Shauna and I are only five minutes away, so call if you need anything. - Thanks. - Cool, thank you. - Okay, pick you up for work tomorrow? - I'll be ready. - All right. - I'm going to go swimming! Whee! - Hey, Macey? Dinner in a little bit, 'kay, kiddo? - Okay. - Hi. - Oh, sorry, I was just... Is this okay for dinner? Or I could get myself takeout? - No, no, please, eat with us. Uh... Like I told you, I've never done this before, so why don't we just do it family style? Everything that's here is for us all. Um, I'm not much of a cook but I'm more than happy to help with the meal-making. - Me too. - Okay, so why don't we just... - Take turns? - Perfect. - Okay. - Right. - Can we go to that big beach tomorrow? - I have to work, kiddo. But I bet Amber has some plans for you. - There will be lots of chances for the beach but I've got some other ideas first. - All right. - Is there a way you prefer we get around the island? - Um, yeah, just take the rental car. Tony's gonna be picking me up most days anyway, so... - Okay, thanks. - Yeah. - I'm going to go back to the pool. - Uh-uh-uh. Plate to the sink, and then go get ready for bed. - Really? - Yes. - Fine. - Okay, well, I think I'm going to go clean up. - Oh, sorry. I hope I'm not disturbing you. - That's okay, I was just doing some... - Work? - Yeah. - Have you always worked in the energy industry? - Sort of. - Sort of how? - Solar. - Oh. You must know a lot about all these alternative energy things. - Yeah. - How long ago did you change to wind energy? - It's been a while, several years. Well, I'm gonna turn in. Night. - Night. (calm music) - Hi, Dad. - Oh, there you are, good morning. Glad you're awake, I didn't have to wake you. Okay, listen to me. I have to leave, all right, but I will be back tonight. I want you to have fun and be careful. Listen to Amber, okay? All right. - Good morning. - Good morning. Call me if you have any questions, all right? And I was wondering if you might be able to text me so I know where Macey is? - Will do. - Maybe you could put together like a schedule so I kind of know where she's always at, okay? - Sure. Have a good day. - Okay. Oh, uh, love you. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, see you, bye. - Want some breakfast? - Sure. - Well, we have a lot to do today. - Do we have to do homework? - How about we don't call it that? - But that's what it is. - It'll be different, I promise. Wanna know why? - Why? - Because the whole island is our classroom and playground. So we'll have a lot of fun, and just happen to learn some stuff along the way. Sound good? - I guess. - And I promise no intentional learning on the weekends. - Okay. - Well, what do you think? - Well, there's plenty of room for more. How many more sites do we have on the short list? - There's three, but this one has the benefit of preexisting infrastructure. - Yeah. You have the wind readings for here? - Yeah. There you go. So how's Amber working out? - Good. Strange. - Really? She seemed normal enough to me. - No, not her, just her being around. I don't know, I didn't think about her being under the same roof as me. - Ah, a woman in the house. - Yeah. This morning she said "Have a good day!" I had these flashbacks of married life. - You didn't do the automatic kiss thing when she said it, did you? (laughs) Okay. Just make sure you're dressed when you leave your room. - Yeah, right. - You'll get used to it. Ready for the next site? - Yeah, let's go. - All right. - Is this like a zoo? - Sort of. All the animals here are rescued. - Like a shelter? - Exactly. - What kind of shelter has donkeys? - (laughs) Here, feed him a carrot. The donkeys were brought here by the Spanish centuries ago. So now there's wild donkeys on the loose, and some in sanctuaries like this. - Cool. Can you take a picture of me so my dad can see? - Good idea. Say cheese. - Cheese! - Oh my gosh, look at 'em. - The baby baby ones to come over here. - I like the little baby ones. Hey! Wow, this little guy's hungry. - They're so cute. - I know. I love 'em. I like how their little hands wrap around. Oh my gosh! Look at these over here. Here, see if this one will take it. He's coming. Go a little bit closer. Look at him. Oh my gosh! Look at those. - Look at that! Do you think camels like carrots? - I don't know, let's find out. - Will you try it first? - Sure. You want to try? - Yeah. It's slobbery. - We'll just wash our hands after we're done. That's a nice bracelet. - My dad gave it to me. He got it on a trip to Ireland. - Wow, Ireland? - Yeah, he went there for work. He says it's for luck. And it's my favorite color. - Green's my favorite too. Does he always bring you back things from his trips? - Not really. I guess he just wanted to get it because my mom left. - Oh. Well, that was nice of him. - So there are wild donkeys now on the island. I wonder if we'll see one. - Maybe. What else did you see? Camels, and goats, and these cute ones that kept crying at us to give them food. And sheep and monkeys and even cows, but they didn't do much. - Well, it sounds like you had a fun day. - Yep, we did. Can we go to the big beach this weekend? - Sure. - Yes! Is Amber coming? - Oh, I'm sure she has other things to do. Anyway, we should get you some sunscreen. - I put some in my bag. - You sure? - I'll go check. (calm music) - So what do you have planned for Macey this week? - Some more exploring. There's a cave I think would be neat. Is she claustrophobic? - No, but I don't think she'd be thrilled with the dark. - This one has a light source in it. - She'd be fine then. - Good. Here. - Thanks. (bowl clatters) Sorry. - Here. - Thank you. - I think it's empty. - It is? Well, then maybe a trip to the store is in order because I forgot to pack any. - Dad, did you not want Amber to come? - What do you mean? - Today, with us? - No, she could've come. But maybe we should just give her a chance to do some other things, you know? - Like you for work? - No, like give her a break. She watches you when I can't, and today I can. So maybe we should give her a chance to do something of her choice, you know. - You don't think she wanted to come to the beach? - I don't know. There'll be other chances. Besides, I think it's a good idea that you and I spend some time together, don't you think? - Yeah! - Yeah. All right, kiddo, go get showered and changed. - I'm starving. - I know, and the faster you shower, the faster you can eat, okay? Take that for me? - Okay. (calm music) - [Amber] Hi. - Sorry. Hi. - How was the beach? - It was good. Macey's hungry. I was gonna make dinner unless you already did. - No, but there's some chicken defrosting in the fridge. - Okay. - And there's some broccoli too. - All right. - [Tony] Hello? - Um, hold on. Tony. Oh, Shauna. - Connor, it's good to see you. - Good to see you. How are you? - Good. - We're here to take you out. Show you and Macey some good dinner spots. - Oh, you don't have to do that. - And yet, we're going. - All right, well, let me go change. - Oh, you're good. This is Aruba, you're fine as you are. - Oh, hey, Amber. Come meet my wife, Shauna. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi. - You'll be joining us for dinner, won't you? - Yes, please do. - No, Amber's got some things- - Amber's going to be taking care of Macey all week. She could use a good meal prepared by someone else, right? - Sure, I'd like that. - I think we're at a 50-50 chance that they'll approve more turbines on the island. - [Connor] We've gotta do better than that. - No, I'm just saying, they know the drawbacks. - Yeah, but they know the benefits, that's the thing. - Well, at least the food was good, even if the company isn't. - Oh, hey now. - Macey and Amber didn't agree to a business meeting. - It's fine. How much power does wind provide here? - Less than 15% of the total energy usage. Aruba has constant winds, which make it an easy power source. - Of course it would be better if we provide at least 25% or more of the needed power. - So what's the issue? - Well, these turbines aren't exactly cheap. And while they provide a lot of energy, nobody has really come up with an aesthetically pleasing design. - Oh. But they already have them here? - Yeah, you should see them sometime. They're huge, like, what, 80 meters tall? - Yeah, they definitely stand out, and not in a good way for some. - But that's the plus of some of the other sites. It's places that nobody goes. - Yet. - Can I go down and play at the beach? - Uh, yeah. - Stay, I'll go with her. - I don't blame you at all for running away from all that work talk. - Oh, no, that's not what I was doing. - I'm teasing. (laughs) - You must know a lot about this. - More than I would like. But it brought me here. - Well, I guess I should thank Macey. You know, it gave me a chance to tag along. - I'm glad you're here for her. She needs a woman in her life. I think she was lonely back home. It's been awhile. - Has it? - Connor didn't tell you anything? - Not really. - Hmm. Connor's ex-wife hurt him bad. Well, hurt both of them, with the way that she left. I think it's good for them to be away. You know, it keeps their mind off her for a little while. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Hi, Candice. - Wow, you get a lot of junk mail. - [Amber] Oh, yes. - [Candice] How's Aruba? - Pretty good. - What? It's a tropical island. - Actually, it's a desert island. - Don't use that teacher voice on me. - [Amber] Guilty. - Seriously though, how is it? - Well, the island is fine, but the job kinda takes some getting used to. - The girl? - No, more her dad. It's awkward, and I can't figure out if it's something I'm doing that's making him uncomfortable or if he's just wanting to keep me at arms-length, like... - Like what? - Like hired help? I don't know. I guess I just didn't think this through. It's not just teaching Macey and watching her, but I'm living in a house with strangers. And I think there are some issues he's still trying to work out from his divorce. - Yeah, I bet. Maybe he's intimidated by you. - Yeah, right. - I'm serious. Beautiful women can make some men be absolute klutzes. - Thank you, but I doubt that's the reason. - You never know. Either way, just give it some time. And speak up. You don't just have to grin and bear it. - So how are things there? Did you have your checkup at the doctor? (upbeat music) - Is it dark in there? - Not completely. It'll be fine, I promise. - What is this place? - It's a natural cave. - How? - Water. Underground rivers carve at the rock until it opens up into something like this. - Wow. How does the light get in? - [Amber] Maybe the same way. - Water can do all that? - Yes. And other natural influences. Do you know what those are called? - Stamites? - Stalagmites. They're formed by drops of water and minerals. They're the ones that come from the ground up. - What about these? - If they come from the ceiling, they're called stalactites. Want a cool way to remember their names? Stalagmites push up with all their might. Stalactites hold on tight. Let's get a picture for your dad. - Cheese! - Stalactite! - Stalactite! - What are you drawing? - The cave. I think my stalactites look like teeth. Oh no. - [Amber] What? - My bracelet's gone. - Okay, when did you have it on last? - Today, but I'm not sure. - You go check your room, I'll go check the car, okay? - Anything? - No, sorry. Did you go by the pool when we got home? - No. It must have fallen off at the cave. Can we go back there? - How about tomorrow? Your dad is going to be home soon. - But what if someone takes it, or steps on it? - We'll go look for it, I promise. Let's just wait for your dad to get here and then we'll see what we can do. - But Daddy gave it to me. - [Amber] He won't be upset. - But it's my lucky bracelet. - I know. (slow music) - Hey. - Hi. Macey's sleeping. - Already? Oh, wow, you had a busy day. - She lost her bracelet today and she is really upset about it. - Oh no. - She fell asleep not too long ago. It's kind of a drive to the caves but I think that's where she lost it. I told her we could go back there tomorrow to look for it but it didn't help. - Can we get there before dark? - There, yeah. But it'll be dark on our way back. - Let's go then. - Do you want me to wake her? - No, let her sleep. I'll call Tony and Shauna, see if they can watch her while we're gone. - See anything? - No. - The entrance is up here. Watch your head. - Whoa. - Nice, isn't it? - What's the story with this place? - I'm not sure. I read about some tragic forbidden romance, but... We came here for the stalagmites and the stalactites. You should ask Macey about it. - I will. All right, so any idea where it might be? - No, she was running around everywhere. - Okay. Well, you look over there, I'll look over here? - Yeah. Macey told me you gave her the bracelet? A souvenir from Ireland? - Yeah. It was kind of a difficult time, I thought she might like it. I had no idea that she was gonna become this attached to it though. - Well, it means a lot to her. - Oh! Over here. A little dusty but nothing a little water won't handle. Ow! (grunts) - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. - Don't touch that! - Why? - Well, you're not supposed to, um... Here. - No, I'm good. - You sure? This isn't some male hurt pride thing, is it? - No, no, no. Ow! - Then let me help. Lean on me. How is it? - It's okay, I just stepped on a rock. (groans) - That wasn't so bad, was it? - No, I just, ow. - Do you need to sit? - Yeah. - Okay. - Sorry. I'm just not used to this. - What, someone helping? - No, just... Having a woman around. - Oh. Is that why you've been... - Been what? - Um, keeping me away? Like you don't want me around? - No. No, not intentionally. I just didn't know if you wanted your space or if I was asking too much. - You hired me to take care of Macey. - I know. I'm sorry, it's just so new to me. With my ex-wife, it was a thing and then... You're not my wife, and now it's... This is sounding really weird. - A little. - Yeah. Look, here's the thing. I don't know where the line is. I don't know... I don't know what we expect of each other and what's acceptable or what's asking too much of you. - Like the whole making dinner thing? - Yeah. That and my space and your space and this... You know, you always being around and... - I have no problem pulling my weight. And if I wanted my space or time, I'd ask. - Oh. - What if we just simply talked? No assumptions, just be straight forward with each other? - Yeah. I'd like that. - You ready to go? - Yeah. (grunts) - Wow. - She's a pool shark. - Look what Amber and I found. (Macey gasps) - Thank you! - You're welcome. All right, bedtime. - We're playing a game. Plus, I took a nap. - Okay, shower fast and you can keep playing. - Okay. - We just started. You want to play teams? - I do not play well. - Good. You can be on Connor's team. (laughs) Let's do this. - What's this? - Math. - Ew! - Two pages. Do your best. It's just to keep what you learned in fourth grade fresh in your mind. And after that, we're going to build a home for a lizard. - Cool! What type of lizards are those? - I think those are Aruban whiptails. Some are that blue green color and others are brown. - What do they like to eat? - Bugs. And maybe some plant leaves and flowers probably too. - Look, there's some ants in here. - Good job! I think that's going to be a perfect home for a lizard. - A whole family of lizards. Do you have kids? - No, I don't. - All my other teachers do. Their kids are lucky. - Why? - Their moms want them. - I think we should find a place where the lizards can see this. - How about under a tree? - Okay, let's go find one. - Hey, guys! - Hey, Dad! - I brought some takeout home. - What is it? - Nachos. - Yes! - [Connor] Ready to get out? - Five more minutes? - Two. - Okay. - I'm going to help your dad, okay? - Okay. - Hey. I got a selection of items here, so if nachos aren't your thing. - No, sounds good. I'm good with anything. - Okay. - Um, Macey said something today, and I wasn't really sure how to respond. - Okay. - Well, it was about her mother. - Oh, all right. - She seemed down about it. I don't want to pry, but it might be helpful to know a little bit of the history there. - Yeah, no, yeah, you're right, of course. Short version, a couple of years ago, Macey's mom, she wasn't sure what she wanted anymore. And she felt like being married and having a family was holding her down. So, she left. She barely made it to the divorce proceedings. We haven't seen her since. - Wow. That must be hard for Macey. - Yeah. - What do you want me to say, if it comes up again? - Uh, jeez, I don't know. I mean, whatever you think's best. You know, I do my best to reassure her and tell her I love her and that none of this was her fault, you know. But I'm not even confident any of my answers have helped. - I wonder what made her think of this today. - Tomorrow's the anniversary of my wife leaving. Macey, time's up. - Coming! (knocking) Amber? - Macey? Everything okay? - The lizard came into the house we made. - Really? - Yep, but he left already. Oh, and we have to go to the store today. - Okay. - It's my dad's birthday. - Today? He didn't say anything. - Can we surprise him? - Sure. Of course. - Great, I'll go get dressed. But don't tell Dad. - Okay. - Oh, hey. You're leaving early today. - Yeah, running some errands. Macey's brushing her teeth. - Oh, okay. - I hear it's your birthday. - Ah, yes. - Isn't today the day you said your ex-wife... - Left? Yeah. Bad timing. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. - Well, um, if you can, it'd be good to be home in time for dinner. - Okay. - I promised Macey I wouldn't say any more than that. - Oh, got it. - I got my dad a stuffed penguin once, but he didn't love it as much as I did. - What's his favorite animal? - He says he likes them all, but not snakes. - Hmm. Well, maybe this year you can give him something other than a stuffed animal. - Yeah? The lizard? - I think that could be a pet for you. - Okay. What about perfume? - You mean cologne? - It's very grown up. - What if you made him something? - I do that every year. He keeps everything but you can only have so many pictures and things. - I don't think he'd ever get tired of those. - Still. He could use a new shirt. - Yeah? - And his favorite color's blue. - Okay. Well, there are some clothing stores around here. I bet we can find a blue shirt that'd be perfect for him. Come on. - Minister Figaroa, of the sites possible, the best combination of wind reliability and cost is the existing wind turbine location. - We understand that there is concern about it being in a more visited park area but the benefit is that it's already government owned land. - Other sites are owned by our government too, sites which are more out of the way from our tourists' paths. - Yes, but building the power station out to those areas will be very costly. - We prepared some comparisons, so you can see what we're talking about. - I would like to bring a colleague in to join us. - Of course. - You have time? - Absolutely. - Yeah. - Cake is done. - Will we have time for icing? - I'll put it in the fridge so it cools off faster. - We encourage you to check our analysis. I think you'll find that the national park site is still the most promising. - We will discuss it, particularly the potential negative impact on tourism. That, and the costs of any sites, are our greatest concerns. - Of course. - Thank you both for your time tonight. - Not a problem, thanks. (gentle music) Hey. Is she still awake? - Um, I doubt it. She wanted to surprise you. For your birthday. I texted you to see when you'd get back. - Yeah, I missed it. I was in a meeting. Mace? I'm sorry. (upbeat music) - Macey. Macey. Hey. Come on, we can still go surprise your dad. - Yeah? - Yeah. There you go. - Thank you. - Eggs. - Is that everything? - The cake. - For breakfast? - Only for birthdays. We'll come back for it. (alarm ringing) - Happy birthday, Dad! - Thank you, Macey. - And there's more. Hurry, Amber! - Coming. - Look at that stack of pancakes! - Happy birthday! Macey can help you. - Thank you. - Open your present. I picked it out myself. - You did? Oh, I love the color. - I knew you would. There's cake too. Amber said it's okay for birthdays. - Well, that sounds great. Hey. - Hey. Macey chose well. - Oh, yeah, nice, right? Thank you. Um, I told Macey I'd be taking the day off today. - That's great. - I hope that doesn't ruin any plans you had. - Oh, no, it's okay. We can make it up another day. So what are you two going to do? - Oh. No, I meant I'd be hanging out with the two of you today. If that's okay. - Of course. - Ostriches? Cool! - So they farm them? - I guess we'll find out. - So you can see it already, gray ones are the mommies, black ones are the daddies. Mating season for the ostriches is the end of September till the end of February. Every two or three days, mama will lay an egg, around 15 eggs. One ostrich egg is around 24 chicken eggs, but you can better eat 24 ostrich egg than even eat one chicken egg because it's low in cholesterol and very high in protein. You want to feed 'em? - You wanna go, Mace? - No, you go first. - Me first? - Go on. - Come on, Papa. You just hold the bowl. - Yeah. - Thumbs underneath it. When the heads go in there, that's how it feels. - All right. - Just watch your back. Daddy is coming from that side. - [Amber] Look at that, Macey. - They're so loud when they eat! - Here, let's take a picture. - Okay. - [Amber] One, two, three. - All right. All right, you want a go? Your turn. - Oh, I don't, I'm good. - Yeah, I'll take the picture. - Okay. - There you go. - Oh my. - All right, take a picture. - This is so cool! - [Ostrich Guide] It's something different, right? - Yeah. - [Ostrich Guide] There you go. - Macey, that was amazing. Are you gonna try? - Yeah. - Okay, you're up. - There you go. Now we can see your beautiful face. - [Connor] Nice job, Macey. - [Amber] Good job! - There you go, good job. - That was cool, that was cool. Good job. - So, for the ostriches, daddy prepares the nest. Daddy makes a hole in the ground for mama to lay her eggs in there. Lately, is raining a lot on the island, so if daddy is not taking care of the eggs, the water goes in there and eventually the baby will drown. - Can't they build a better nest? - I wish. But the way how they do it, it's part of the instinct. - Can you train them? - Come see the emus, they already figured it out. - Maybe they can teach them how to build the nest. - One ostrich egg platter, guys. Enjoy. - Wow. - But the ostrich. - He was abandoned, this egg, so he's not gonna make it. - Don't think about it, Mace. Serve it up? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, oh. Sorry about that, here you go. Here you go. Knock yourself out on that. - Thank you. - All right. So how is it? - Good. - I still think it's sad the ostrich eggs don't hatch. - Well, it's part of life, sweetheart. - Still, there has to be a way to fix it. - You know, maybe you could write something about it. - Like what? - Like what you think could help. Maybe a little report. - Okay. I'll have to tell Lizard I can't play when we get home. - Lizard? - She sort of caught one. - He's my pet. - A free-roaming pet. I've yet to see it. - Oh. (calm music) Hey. - Hi. - Macey just informed me that she wants an ostrich toy. - Uh oh. Watch out, penguins. - Yeah, I know. - Ostrich fan now? - No, no, I'd say more the experience than the animal for sure. - I had fun too. - How do you go back to the classroom after all this? - I don't know. I probably will be the only one who knows the difference. - You're gonna be disappointed. - Probably. - So you like it? Teaching? - Yeah. - Have you always taught fourth grade? - No. I started out with kindergarten, but one year of that was enough. I thought I was patient, but not that patient. And then it was sixth grade, and then second grade, and then fourth grade. I've just kinda stuck with that. - What made you want to teach? - My dad. He taught math at my high school. - That must have been strange for you. - I thought so at first, but my friends loved his class. Both because he helped them understand, and because he cared. I think that's what made me want to be like that. Make a difference. Even though most of them won't remember me in a few years. - Oh I doubt that. You make a bigger difference than you think you do. I know Macey's not gonna be the same after this summer. - Well, she's pretty amazing to begin with. - Yeah. Well, thanks for coming out and putting up with us. Okay, putting up with me. (Amber laughs) (waves crashing) - We already know this location isn't ideal. - I know. We're waiting for a decision. I thought we could just get some more information on this site, you know? - The data here says that the winds are too strong too often. With the stress on the blades, they'll be unable to run anyway. - Right. No, I agree with you, I'm just saying let's see what we can find. - If you say so. All right, biological impact might be higher. Lots of birds. Probably bats too. - Exactly. - So how was your day off? - It was good. - Cool, what'd you do? - Amber took us to an ostrich farm. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - She's working out? Not so weird anymore, huh? - Macey really likes her. I was wondering if you knew of some fun things we could do while we're in the country? - Like what? - I don't know. Just wanted to find something for us to do this weekend. - Us, as in you and Macey, or us as in you, Macey, and Amber? - Amber might be there. - I know just the thing. (upbeat music) (flamingo calling) - Daddy, look! - Oh, cool, huh? Look at that. - And there are more over there! - Oh, wow, look at that. Hey, sweetie, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Hurry! - She can wait, she can wait. - No, I can't! - Are you sure? - I got it, go. - Thank you. Macey, wait for me, honey. - This is so cool. - I know, look at that. Wow. Phone, phone, phone. Ah. - Take lots of pictures. - That's the idea, right? Hey, that can wait. Come on. (laughs) No, no, no! - Okay, let's take a picture. One, two, three. Okay, one more. One- - Do you want one with all of you? - Yeah. - All right. - Thank you. - All right, you're welcome. Cute. All right, one, two, three. One more. One, two, three. - Thank you! - [Woman] You're so welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, Macey! You want a drink? - In a minute! - Here you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. - You know, you're spoiling me. This hardly feels like work. - That's not a bad thing though, right? - Not at all. I bet you had a lot of people wanting to come. Did you really interview 15 people? - Wait a minute, where'd you hear that? - My sister. Who heard it from her husband, who heard it from your dad, so it probably was exaggerated. - Yeah. Actually, it was 19. - Really? - Yeah. - Were they that bad? - No, I wouldn't say they were bad. I mean, you know, they were okay. But that's the thing, they were just okay. I'm cautious, you know. I didn't want to stick Macey with somebody who was impatient or stern, gonna give her a miserable summer. I want her to be happy. - Me too. - We're lucky we found you. - Well, we have our families to thank for that. - Oh, yeah, your sister, how's she doing? Now she's the one that you said you were gonna go home and visit, right? - Yeah, she's doing well. Healthy, both her and the baby. - That's great. Now is this your first niece or nephew? - Niece, and yes. - That's exciting. - Yeah. Do you have any brothers or sisters? - Yeah, I've got a brother. He's got three boys. - So what's the secret to being a good uncle? - (laughs) Well... I don't know, just play with them a lot when their parents won't. You'll quickly be their favorite. - I'll keep that in mind. - Oh, I doubt you'll have any trouble. - Because I'm the only aunt anyway? - Yeah. (Amber laughs) No, because you're genuine, because you care. You're not gonna have to rely on tips or tricks. You'll be fine. - Thank you. (phone ringing) - This is Tony. Hold on a second. Hey, Tony, what's up? Oh, okay. I was afraid of that. All right, let's deal with this first thing Monday. All right, bye. (sighs) The government's leaning towards putting off the expansion of the wind turbines. - What will you do? - I don't know, we'll figure out something. That or go home early. - Whoa. They're huge! - Yep. And they can even be bigger than that too. Dad said the biggest one in the world is, like, 250 meters tall. - Wow, that's crazy. I figured you know a lot about these, way more than me. But I just wanted to see 'em. - Dad thinks they're pretty cool. But he says some people think they're boring. - (laughs) Well, I think they're cool too. - Yeah, okay, I got it. All right. No, Tony and I are doing everything we can, so... Okay, bye. - Everything okay? - Yeah, just bosses telling me how worried they are. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, it's all right. - Macey and I stopped by the wind turbines today. It was amazing. - Oh, cool. I'm glad you got to see it. - Yeah. Well, I know you're busy so I'll leave you to it, but would you want to tag along with us to these gold mill ruins I'm taking Macey to tomorrow? Kind of a history excursion. - Tomorrow? Oh, shoot. I'd love to, but Tony and I are in the thick of things and... - Yeah, sure. I just thought I'd check. - Well, have fun though. - Yeah, we will. (calm music) - Whoa, cool! - This is what's left of a gold mill. - Like real gold? - Mm-hmm. Lots of explorers searched this and other islands for gold. They did find some here in Aruba. Guess how much? - A million dollars worth? - Try three million pounds of gold. Way more than a million dollars. - Can we see if we can find some? - Sure. - Whoa, it's like an old castle. - Yeah, it is. - Can we play hide and seek in here? - (laughs) Sure. - Do you have a boyfriend back home? - No, I don't. Do you? - Ew, no. But Robbie always chases me, so I think he wants to be my boyfriend. - I see. - Do you want a boyfriend? - I suppose if I find the right one, yes. - My dad could be him. - I think he loves you so much that no one else could compete. - That's a different kind of love. Everyone knows that. - True. - Do you think he's handsome? - Yeah. - Good. - Macey, there's more to liking someone than just what they look like. - Oh, I know. That's what got me thinking. - What do you mean? - Dad acts differently around you than everyone else. - Well, not everyone. - Yeah, he does. (calm music) Can we watch a movie when we get back? - Depends. You conveniently left the back page of a spelling worksheet blank. (Macey sighs) (car beeping) - What's wrong? - I don't know. - Can you fix it? - I can't even tell what's broken. It's okay. Let's just see what we can do. (engine sputtering) (car beeping) Oh, wow. - Is that normal? - Um, let's try calling your dad, okay? Maybe he can tell us what's wrong. - Amber, what are we going to do? - Macey? I'm home, kiddo! Macey? Amber? Mace? (phone ringing) - [Amber] Hi, this is Amber. Leave me a message. - Hey, it's Connor, I'm home. Just wondering when you'll be back. Give me a call when you get the message, thanks. (rain pounding) (thunder crashing) - Are we stuck here? - For now. But we're fine. We still have some drinks and snacks left from our picnic. See? - Are we going to spend the night here? - I hope not. Someone will come soon. Hey, we're fine, okay? - But what if no one comes? - Then we'll have a campout in the car. We'll make it an adventure. Hi, this is Amber. Leave me a message. (phone ringing) - Hey, Tony. Yeah, I need to borrow your car. - Did she say where she was going today? - Yeah, gold mill ruins. - Okay, which ones? - What do you mean? - There are two of 'em. - Are you kidding me? I don't know, she just wrote "gold mill ruins." - Okay, she didn't mention the name, Balashi or Bushiribana? - No, neither of those sound familiar. - Okay. We'll go to one and if they're not there, we'll go to the other one. - Okay, yeah, let's just hurry. - You won't leave, will you? - Of course not. - Promise? - Absolutely. - What about to get help? - If I went to get help, you'd be coming with me, okay? I won't leave you alone. (thunder crashing) (kisses) - What is it? - Someone's coming. Hang on. - Who is it? - I don't know. - Amber? - Macey? - Dad? - Macey, Macey. What happened out there? - The car just stopped working all of a sudden. And there was no cell phone reception. - So why were you out there, in the middle of nowhere? Do you know how risky that is? - I took her to a tourist spot in the middle of the day. How is that risky? - Well, you're lucky Tony knew where to go, especially since there's two gold mill sites. - I didn't know that. Someone would have found us in the morning. - Unharmed? Do you know how afraid Macey was? She is? - Yes, I do. - What if someone else came along? Who knows who? - Trust me, I was just as scared. Okay, I thought about all our options. The only one that made sense was to stay where I was, with Macey, and hope you'd find us. And you did. - Macey wouldn't let me leave her room until she was asleep. - She didn't want to be left behind. I promised her I wouldn't leave her. And I wouldn't have. - I know. Look, it may not seem like it, but I trust you with Macey. But Macey is so fragile. - She's stronger than you think. - I just worry about her. She's all I've got. - So did you have the car towed? - Yeah, they said they'd have it fixed by next week. Thanks for being there last night, by the way. - No problem, man. I don't think I've seen you that tense before. - Yeah, can you blame me? - It wasn't Amber's fault, you know. - I know. It could have happened to anybody. - Does she know that? - I think so. - Might want to make sure. How was Macey today? - Tender, but ready for another adventure. You know Macey. - Yeah. - I told Amber to stay close to the house today. - Kids are resilient. Macey will bounce back just fine. - Yeah, probably faster than I will. I'm getting worried about going back to the States. - What do you mean, why? - Macey. She'd be disappointed when things go back to normal. - You mean when Amber goes back to her life? - Yeah. - You sure she's the only one? I'm just saying. Last night, were you only worried about Macey? (laughs) Think about it. - Yeah! That's really good. You can do three. One, two, three! (gentle music) Hey. - Hi. - Where's Macey? - She went to bed early. - [Macey] Good night! - Good night! Is she all right? - Yeah, no, she's fine. I told her she could read for awhile. Um, dinner's ready. I found a great little spot in the back here, thought it might be nice. - Okay, she... - She's already eaten. Yeah, no, come on. - Okay. What's this? - This is an apology. If that's okay? - Thank you. - Please. What? - What are you apologizing for? - Ah, yeah. Well, I realized, in being the overly protective father that I am, I didn't make sure that you were okay after last night. - Oh. I am. Thank you. - Good, I'm glad. - So how's the wind project going? - Nothing new. Everyone is still concerned about the visual impact. - Is that diplomatic-speak for eyesore? - Pretty much. - Sometimes the best way is to just acknowledge it. Embrace it. - How do you mean? - Macey and I drove by it the other day. - You did? - Mm-hmm. I wanted to see them for myself. And they stand out, but so what? They're also pretty neat. I wouldn't want them in my backyard but they're breathtaking to see. - Hmm. So how would you make it better? - I don't think you can change the way they look but once you know how they work and what they do and why, you don't care about the visual. - I wish everyone shared your viewpoint. - Give them a chance to. Maybe an educational outpost or something. - Huh. - So can I ask you a personal question? - Well, that depends on the question. - Never mind. - No, now you got me curious. - Have you ever thought about another relationship? Or remarrying? - Um. Well, I was married for 11 years, and then one day, it was tossed out the window, so, no, not seriously, no. - What about for Macey? - No, I don't want her to get hurt again. - Hmm. - You don't approve. - It just sounds lonely. - I can handle it. - I meant for you both. - What about you? - Me? - Yeah, ever been married? - I've had a few almost-engagements. - Dating? - Not recently. Too time-consuming. Not the relationship itself, I mean, that's worth it. But getting there, the whole dating process. - And no one's caught your eye? - Most of the men I interact with are fathers of my students. - Oh, oh. Like me. - This is different. Some of them are married. - No, really? - I'm sorry to say I've had more pickup lines come my way at parent-teacher conferences than I care to admit. - [Connor] (laughs) Oh, wow. So how do you handle that? - [Amber] Oh, I've come up with a few tactics. - [Connor] What if we make this an attraction? - It's hardly a theme park. - No, no, no, like a building about wind power. Something to educate visitors, like a visitors' center. - To what end? - Amber said something the other day about embracing what it is. I mean, it's not pretty. But it doesn't matter because what's unique about it is its purpose. - A visitors' center. - Yeah. - Who pays for it? - One problem at a time. - Just saying, you know, it's gonna come up. - So we crunch some numbers, see how much it's gonna cost, but what do you think? - I like it. Let's try it. - I want to draw a boat too. - That's great. - What are you two artists up to? - We're drawing the ocean. - That's pretty good, Mace. Yours isn't bad either, Amber. - (laughs) Want to join us for a break? - Actually, I thought we'd get out of the house a bit. - For what? ♪ I've been searching, searching for something ♪ - Is that it? - [Connor] That's it. - Will they take us to treasure? (Connor laughs) - You all ready for some fun? - Yes! - All right, let's go. - Let's go. (murmuring) - Oh, look. - [Macey] Yeah, right there? - [Connor] Yeah. - Okay. ♪ It's waiting for me - All right, sweetie, let's go. Come on up here. All right, kiddo. Grab this thing right here. - There you go. - You want me to go first? All right, have a seat, I'll show you how it's done. You guys got me down? - Yeah, go for it. - [All] Three, two, one! (Connor shouts) - Yeah! - Come on, Macey! Your turn, kiddo! Let's go! (cheering) - Your turn. Come on, come on, you can do it. Are you gonna make me go first? (cheering) ♪ It's waiting for me - That was awesome! - Here you go. That was fantastic. - Yeah, that was awesome. (gasps) Oh, sorry. ♪ It's waiting for me ♪ Silver sands, sparkling seas ♪ Mountaintops, flying dreams ♪ Life's a chance, live it free ♪ ♪ Time is now, it's waiting, waiting for me ♪ ♪ It's waiting for me - Can you even see over the wheel? - Not really. - It's okay, I'll tell you if we hit something. (laughs) - Thanks for this. - Yeah. Consider it a thank you for the idea. - What idea? - To turn the turbines into a destination. - Is that what I said? - More or less. But you got me thinking. And now I've got Tony running some numbers on a visitor's center that's dedicated to wind power and turbines. - Really? - Yeah, all because of you. - Whatever. So what's next? - Well, we put together a pitch, and I don't know, I think this is what it's gonna take to get it pushed through. - You're gonna be ready for a license after this. - Yeah! - She's having a blast. She's an amazing girl. - Yeah, she is. - I mean it. A lot of that is because of you. - Yeah, well, I hate to admit it, but her mom probably deserves a little bit of credit. - How did you cope, after the divorce? Macey was, what, eight? - Yeah. Well, my parents helped a lot. But I struggled a little bit. Felt like I had to do everything myself, you know? - That's a lot of pressure. - It is. But it's worth it. She's everything that matters, you know? - She sees you as her whole world too. - I know. It makes me a little bit nervous. - Why? - I don't know. What if I'm not enough? You know? What if she needs something more than just me? Sorry, I'm just rambling. - Are you? - Maybe. - I get what you're saying. - You do? - Neither one of you wants to be lonely anymore. - We haven't been so much since we've been here. You've driven away the loneliness, for both of us. - I have? - Yeah. - I'm glad. You deserve to be happy. (gentle music) - Sorry. - It's all right. - No, no, that was a mistake. I... I didn't mean to... - To kiss me? - Yes. No. - [Macey] Dad! - Yeah, hi, honey. - Tony said I'd be a great pirate. - Really, you would be. - [Macey] Amber, do you want to drive the ship? - Um, I don't have my license. (laughs) - Whee! - Hey, kiddo, what you doing? - Look, it's kinda like a swing. - Here, let me try. Oh, you ready? - Mm-hmm. - Let's go on three. One, two, three, go. - Whee! Hi, Amber. - Hi. I'm headed up the street to the beach. I just wanted to see if Macey wanted to go. - Sure! I'll go get changed. - We'll only be a couple of hours. - Amber. - Yeah. - It wasn't fair for me to kiss you. I'm sorry. - I'm not sorry we kissed. - It's too soon. I mean, we barely know each other. - Isn't that why people spend time together? - I'm not ready for that. - Connor, you're not the only one who feels something. And if you need more time, that's okay. - That's kind of you, but... I was with somebody for over a decade and I was wrong about her. And I don't know if it's because I was blind to her feelings or if I changed. Until I do, I can't do this. I just don't want you waiting for something that might not happen. - What do you think? - I think it needs to be stronger right there. Will we still see each other when we get back home? - I'd like that. - But? - Well, you'll be starting school when we get back and so will I. And you'll have your friends and your grandparents... And your dad. You might be too busy. We'll see, all right? (Macey laughing) (phone ringing) Hi, Candice. What? Really? And the baby? Oh, I'm so glad! Text me a picture, okay? Yeah, I'll be on the next flight. How much does she weigh? - Do you have to go? - She's my sister. I promised I'd come. - But you'll be back? - Yeah. - Mace, you left your plate on the table, honey. Can you take care of that for me, please? - Fine. - Thank you. We can take you to the airport. - No, it's okay. I know this isn't real convenient for your work, but thanks. - Well, I can work from here, and when I can't, Shauna said she could fill in. So, yeah. - Okay. If you prefer, I don't have to come back. - It's your decision. - Well, maybe it'd be easier if I didn't. (slow music) Her little hands! I can't get over them. Oh, she's precious. - Not at three in the morning. - How is sleep going? - You know, people warned me, but sleep deprivation is worse than I thought. Rob is going to start taking shifts or I'm going to go bonkers. - And I can help too. - How long are you staying? I thought you had to get back. - I'm not sure. Things are winding down there, so I might see if they're fine without me. - Oh. Kind of not like you to leave someone hanging. - Hey, I'm here, right? - All right. So what's really going on? - Nothing. - Amber. - Really, nothing is happening or going to happen. - With Connor? - Yeah. - Okay, do I need to chew him out? Or send Rob to chew out his boss to chew out his son? - No, please don't. - Good, because I don't want Rob to get fired. Mouths to feed and all that. So what's his deal? - He's been hurt before. And I guess I'm not worth the risk. - I thought he was being weird. - We got past that and we became something more. It was amazing. - You could have that with someone else. It might not be Aruba, but still. - It wasn't the place. It was him. And Macey. I adore her. And I know how I feel about him. - Relax. The building costs are reasonable and the staff needs are minimal. - It'll still take some work. - Anything will. They'll go for it. - Yeah. - So have you heard from her? - [Connor] No. - You called her, right? - No. - So is this brooding thing you're doing because of something you did or she did? What'd you do then? - Nothing. I didn't do anything. It wouldn't work anyway. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Those beautiful, caring types are overrated, especially those that genuinely like you and your kid. The nerve of that woman. You know what, you should thank your lucky stars that I'm here and not Shauna. She would boot your behind all the way back home across the ocean. - You're being a bit melodramatic. - Am I? I don't know, you should look in the mirror, buddy. While you're staring at that depressed reflection, you should ask yourself, are the reasons, whatever they are, that you pushed Amber away, are they real or just you flipping out over your own insecurities? - Here they come. - Saved by the bell. - [Man] Sorry for the wait. - Hello, gentlemen, good to see you again. - Good to see you too. - Hey. Guess what? - What? - Our wind power plans got approved. - Good! Right? - Yeah. - Wait, does that mean we have to go home? - No, not yet. I still have some work to do for a few more weeks. - And Amber? - What about her? - She's coming back, isn't she? - I don't know. - Can't we at least go visit her when we get back home? - We'll have to see. - That's what she said too. - Hey, we'll be all right. It's the two of us again. - I don't want it to just be the two of us. I want Amber. - Honey, even if Amber comes back, it's just temporary. - Does it have to be? - Yeah. - She's not like Mom. - I know. - Mom never shared her french fries. - What? - She got upset if I ever took one. Amber's not like that. And Mom never made me lunch for school. - No, because I did. - Not when you were traveling. - Oh, honey. I wish that's all I needed to know, but it's so much more complicated than that. - No, it's not. Amber loves you. - How do you know? - I never saw Mom look at you like Amber does. (gentle music) (phone chirps) - Oh, she's asleep. You can wait on that bottle. - Oh, okay. (phone chirps) - Is that him? - Yeah. He's asking me if I'm coming back. - Are you gonna reply? - I just got the text. - Well, I say you go back. If anything, you made a commitment, and I think you should honor it. - Even if it means all the awkwardness, and me not being able to look him in the eye, and forced talk about nothing? - Who cares? It was awkward before. Treat it just like work. - It's kind of hard to ignore how I feel now. - Well, all the more reason to go back and see if he's changed his mind. - And if he hasn't? I don't think my heart could take that. - Well, then take some time to figure it out, but not too long? (pool balls clacking) - Hmm. - What? - Nothing. - That's the I would have made that shot sound. Heard it before. - Really? Oh, okay. Well, here, put me out of my misery. - Are you sure? Tony's not that hard to beat. - Whoa. - So was Macey okay for you guys today? - Amazing. That girl is pure sunshine. (Tony clears throat) I mean, she's fine, it's just, I'm a little tired. - Okay. - Yeah, I'm just... Don't know how much longer I can keep it up. So when is Amber coming back? - Oh, wow, subtle. She didn't say she was coming back. - Well, did you ask her? - I did, and she didn't answer. - Was it a "Hey, when are you coming back "to take care of Macey?" ask or was it a "I miss you, please come back?" - Is this what the two of you talk about when I'm not around? - Only because you can't figure out what you want, Connor. - Wrong, I know exactly what I want. - Do you? - I do. I miss her. (Shauna sighs) I like her. - Better. - I want her back. - Uh huh. - Bingo. - But I'm not gonna force her, so... - Uh huh. Has she heard any of this slightly better than lukewarm sentiment? - Not really. - Keep wishing then. - Seriously, what can I do? - Really? All those big ideas and brains up in there and you can't figure out how to do something that's so much more important than putting a big fan on a stick? (calm music) (cars honking) - Success. She's asleep. - Look at that, Aunt Amber has the magic touch. - Yep. (doorbell rings) Oh, will that wake her? - Yeah, I should disconnect the doorbell. - I'll go get it. - Thank you. - Amber! - Macey! What are you doing here? - Dad and I came home for the weekend. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - Good. We got you a little something. You want to give it to her? - No, you can do it. - Here you go. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. Uh... Can I talk to you for a minute? - Uh, sure. - Oh, you're gonna want to open that before I forget. - You guys didn't have to. (laughs) - I'm pretty sure she's hoping you'll let her take care of that for you. - We'll see. It's pretty cute. Thanks. - Sure. How's your niece? - Healthy. Sleeping. - How's being an aunt? - Amazing. - That's good. - I should have answered you about coming back. - What would your answer have been? - I'm not sure. - That's fair. I didn't give you much reason to want to come back. - But it's wonderful to see Macey again. Are you taking her to your parents for the rest of the summer or? - No. No, she's... She wanted to see you. She missed you. - That's sweet. - And I missed you. Hey, I had an entire flight to think about what I was gonna say, and how I was gonna say it. A lot of good that did me, right? I'm stalling here. Look, in Aruba, I had my reasons for the way I felt, but those were just excuses. I mean, I was scared. Terrified, to be honest. But that wasn't because of you. I mean, you made the summer, each day, an adventure. For Macey and for me. Look, I don't know if you could tell, but I loved it. And even if I made things more awkward or hard, it didn't change how special things have been. - You, awkward? - I didn't believe there could be someone so kind and real. Not just to Macey, but to me. - Well, you both are pretty easy to care about. - And love? I mean, I know Macey's a shoo-in, but is there room for me? - You know there is. - I hoped so, but I know I pushed you away. I thought I lost you. - You're hard to let go of. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Listen, I can't promise I'm gonna handle everything perfectly from here on out. I mean, there's still stuff that scares me. - That's okay. The best things in life are the ones we're always afraid of losing. It doesn't mean we give up on them though. - So don't give up on me then? - Never. (gentle music) Is Macey going to be all right with all this? - Absolutely. She's your second biggest fan. - Oh, and who's the first? (gentle music)
