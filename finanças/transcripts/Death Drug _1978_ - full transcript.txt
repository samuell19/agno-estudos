Hello, my name is Phillip Michael Thomas. I'm an actor. Maybe you've see me in motion pictures, possibly television, or stage. I've played a number of roles, ranging from doctors to Buffalo Soldiers, to the slick cop, Ricardo Tubbs, on Miami Vice. Regardless of what role an actor plays, it requires an incredible amount of discipline, concentration, and other things that sometimes you can't even define. There are times when you get a role where it's easy, and other times when you gotta dig down deep inside yourself and you come up with things that fascinate even you. I was very fortunate in the fact that I played such a role, in a film called Death Drug. The character I play is Jesse Thomas. He was a budding musician. He had everything going for him. He had a budding career, a beautiful wife, and got a scholarship to a music conservatory. But he made one tragic mistake. He got involved with drugs. "Wack," sometimes it's called "angel dust." This is a forerunner of what we now call "crack." I tell you, this was one of the most incredible experiences of my acting career. I hope you'll enjoy the dramatization. In the top of the news tonight, another tragic death due to the killer drug "angel dust." In Venice. 46 year old Angelo Machete, reportedly an "angel dust" user, went berserk, attacking and injuring eight skaters in an outdoor rink. In this exclusive Action Desk footage shot by one of our cameramen who was preparing a feature on the skaters, Machete began attacking the young people with a large board. OK, we're done here. Are we rolling? Stay away. Watch it. Stay away from me, this guys got a board. Are we still rolling? Keep the camera rolling, keep it rolling. Watch it, somebody gotta get him. Call the police, where's the police? Quick get- There they are. They got him. They got him. We still rolling? OK, we're down here live, we're watching this as it's actually happening, ladies and gentlemen. They captured this madman, this crazy man he's foaming at the mouth we don't know what's wrong with him, but it appears that the police have him in hand right now, and it looks like they're going to take him away. We were a little concerned before because he came very, very close to hitting us with this large board that he has. Oh, he broke away please somebody get him, he broke away. He's running away. Don't let him get it. Watch it. Oh, he got hit by the cars. Oh no. Machete was pronounced dead on arrival at Venice Hospital. This tragic death brings the death toll associated with the killer drug "angel dust," to 19 for this year in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Ritz Base is Over 15. Jesse, are you through already?

You thought that Mama worried about me so much until she died? Well you're wrong! You are wrong, and Mama understood. Mama understood that my music was good. I'm gonna make you proud of me. You're gonna be proud that I'm your son. I've got no son. Daddy! I love you Daddy. I love you. Say something to me! I just want you to tell me that you love me. Time now for some music news that's happening today. Our headline: local boy makes good. Jesse Thomas was on his job yesterday as a working plumber. Today, with a new recording contract in hand, he has plans to retire his steel pipes, and make it big with his music and vocal pipes.

Jesse Thomas's new song, "Just the Way I Planned It." Jesse? Jesse, what are you doing? Huh? Jesse? Oh, I'm just relaxing. Meditating. I'm tired, I think I'm going to hit the sack, baby. It's only nine o'clock. I know. Sure you're feeling okay? Mmhmm. Had a long day. What was that strange smell coming out of the bathroom this morning? What strange smell? You tell me. It's a new aftershave lotion, I guess. Aftershave lotion? It smells like some kind of chemical to me. Chemical? Yeah. Hey Johnny! Let's take a break. I ran out of shirn. Ready? You got any wack? Are you crazy? Man, this turkey found out where I was playing tennis. You got any wack? Give me something so I can get rid of him. I don't know how this cat found out where I am.

I mean it get you so high you need a parachute to come down. Is it as good as shirn? Is it as good? Would I lie to you Jesse? This is the wack, baby. The chief angel. This stuff put more dips in your hips, more cut in your strut, more glide in your stride. This is a monster. Get hip to wack. Let me try one. Try one? My man got stone cold cash. I love a man have no argument with money. There you go, brother. Mama said take her man and treat him well with his cash. Once you come onto the truck and we can fire up. I don't smoke. Never have. No, bronchial trouble. You know, doctor says don't ever smoke. Oh I dig it. Alright, sure, I'll catch you later. Sucker. Hey Jesse, how you doing? How's it going fellas? Where did you get those? Hey Carlos, finished that new installation. What's the word? Hey Jesse. That panel cover over the school needs to be tightened, and you worked on it and they're hesitant to touch it, so get out of the first thing in the morning and take care of it all right. Trying to say my work is no good? Yeah, you're real bum. What are you trying to do to me? What the hell was that for? Don't play dumb with me, Mr. Sims. I know you're trying to get me fired. I'm onto you. All of you. You're all against me, trying to get rid of me. Jesse, what the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about you trying to take my job away from me, man. I'm the one who gave you that job, remember? No, Jesse! Don't! What's got into you? Stop talking to me about friends. You're one of them! You're taking their side against me! What the hell is wrong with him? I don't know, man, but I think he's on something. Whatever it is, he'd better get off it quick. Honey? Do you want chicken or steak for dinner tonight? Excuse me, maestro. But I asked you what you wanted, and you didn't- Shut up, damn it! Don't bite my head off, I just asked you what you wanted to eat. I said shut up! How can I get any work done with you talking to me? Just what is wrong with you? Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Mom? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's nice. Why are they looking at me? Why are they looking at me? Why is who looking at you? Them, that's who! Hey guys, let's take five. Hey fellas, take a break. Boy, I can't wait til we go. Why are they talking about me? I can hear them! Jesse. Nobody's talking about you here, Jesse, nobody's talking about you. I know what you're planning to do. You think I'm stupid or something? Jesse, nobody thinks you're stupid. Shut up! I know what you're trying to do! You! I know what you're trying. Both of you! Trying to do something to me. What are you talking about? I know what you're trying to do! You think I don't know, but I know! Don't you mess with me, don't mess with me. What in the hell did you say to them? Answer me, Jesse. They said you insulted them, and accused them of things that didn't make any sense? Is this true? Carolyn, that was two days ago. I mean, how am I supposed to remember what I said or didn't say? Two days ago you had the chance of a lifetime. Now you have nothing, they canceled your contract. I don't even remember being there two days ago. Maybe I was drunk or something. You've been stoned off that stuff you been smoking! Hey, get off my back, will you? I mean, that ain't nothing from nothing. Everybody smokes a joint every now and then. They smoke a joint, but they don't go through the changes that you do. I ain't going through no changes! Jesse, don't you think I can see, don't you think I can see what is happening today? Ain't nothing happening to me! Jesse. You have alienated everybody. Nobody comes to see us anymore. And Mr. Sims says the only reason you got that job is because of him. Get off my back, would you? Look, I'm working because I'm good! You were good, Jesse. Jesse, look! Look at your hands. Look at them! Honey, you have a gift. And you have a marvelous talent, that is a one in a million. Please! Please don't throw it away like this. Some nonsense that's only going to destroy you. I don't know. I've never seen him like this before. I can't even talk to him without him getting mad at me. I've noticed a change in him too. But he won't listen to me. And I've known him all my life. It's that "angel dust," Melvin. He doesn't even know what he's doing half the time. Might as well be eating rat poison. They say once it gets in your system, you don't get it out. God I'm scared. One minute he acts like there's nothing wrong, and the next minute he he acts like a total stranger. Melvin, please talk to him. Please, I don't know anybody else to turn to. I'll try again. But I don't think it's going to do any good. There's one other thing I can't handle right now. What's that? I'm pregnant. Have you told Jesse? I'm afraid to. Well, he's gonna find out one way or another. Better it be from you than somebody else. No, I don't know what to do. I just feel helpless. I feel so helpless. Take your vitamins, and you keep your weight gained about 20lbs. I really enjoyed the presentation this morning. Well, thank you. You keep your weight gain to about 20lbs. and you'll have a nice normal pregnancy. What are you hoping for? That doesn't matteras long as it's healthy. I know what you mean. How's Jesse doing? I wish I could say he's fine. Carolyn, is something wong? Yes, he's got himself strung out on his "angel dust." PCP. Jesse? Are you serious, girl? Yes. My. Carolyn, don't you know how dangerous that is? PCP is an animal tranquilizer. Can knock out an elephant. Can't he take an antidote to get it out of his system? Taking "angel dust," it's like putting gasoline in your bloodstream. There's no antidote for that. Listen. Well, what can I do? There's nothing you can do. But understand that he has got to want to stop it. And even if he does stop taking it, it can stay in his system for months for years, and then it can come back on him without any warning. Do you understand that? Like the flashbacks? No, it's worse. It's even more violent. Come on, I want to show you this. I'm gonna show you this. This is our PCP treatment ward. I wanted to see this now. Did "angel dust" do all this? Yes, listen. It is unlike any other drug you've ever seen. It is not heroin, and it's not marijuana, or LSD, or cocaine. You name it. It just takes once, Carolyn, just once, and then you start losing all control. Forever? Yes, if he continues to smoke it. Carolyn. What am I supposed to do, sust sit by and watch my husband fall apart in front of my eyes? Now unless Jesse gets to drug related programming meeting with Doctor Harris- He's not gonna go for that. Then you've got to get him to understand what he's doing to himself, before it's too late. Well. Thanks, thanks for listening. I wish I had all the answers. I'll see you next month. Yes. Take care of yourself, OK? How could you do that to yourself? Just getting high. That junk stays in your system. Jesse. You haven't even been married a year. And you're destroying it. And you're destroying Carolyn along with it. And your music too. I know. Sometimes things happen you can't change? I just can't control. You remember? The first day you met Carolyn, in high school. Yeah. She was crying cause her sister's baby had died. Take a closer look at Carolyn. Whatta ya mean? She's gonna need you more than ever. Carolyn! Carolyn. Baby. You're gonna have a baby. Yes. You mean I'm going to be a daddy? Why didn't you tell me? Jesse. Didn't know how you was going to accept it. Carolyn, baby. I'm off that stuff. I swear to you, I'll never touch wack again. Well, if you're serious. I'm serious. Look, I had a long conversation with Melvin and he made me realize what I've been doing to myself. And to you and- And I'm sorry. I swear to you, I'm sorry. You mean it? Yes I mean it. Promise me. I promise. I promise. But understand that he have got to want to stop it, and even if he does stop taking it, it can stay in his system for months, for years. Jesse, what are you doing? Don't you see it? Just wait for me in the car. You hear? Get away from me! Jesse! Get back! What are you doing? This is the wack, baby. The chief angel. This stuff put more dips in your hips, more cut in your strut, more glide in your stride. This is a monster. I can have all of you killed! You're gonna be proud that I'm your son. I've got no son. I'll kill you! You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me? You want to get me? Ladies and gentlemen, this is Larry McCormick with KXDY News. We interrupt our regular programming to bring you a late breaking story, just in on our newswire. Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter Jesse Thomas was killed this evening when he ran in front of an oncoming truck, not far from a supermarket where he and his wife had been shopping earlier. Now witnesses report seeing Thomas acting strangely earlier in the evening. He is reported to have become violent, and is said to have been talking incoherently just before the tragedy occurred. John Singer is with our minicam crew at the scene. John, can you give us any additional information on this very tragic event? John, are you there? Yes, Larry, I can hardly hear you. Do you copy us here at the station studio? Yes we do John, but we have no visuals as of the moment. I guess there's been a problem with the transmission somewhere along the way. But John, while we're waiting for the technicians to correct the problem. What can you tell us, if anything, about Thomas's death tonight? Well, the entire picture isn't clear as yet, and as of course you know very well, the investigators on the scene or interviewing all of the eyewitnesses and will sift through all of the evidence until they are satisfied as to just what happened. But this much is known. Thomas had only recently completed a drug rehabilitation program in an effort to break his drug habit. I hadn't heard that. Well, not many people knew about it, Larry. His managers had very skillfully kept it out of the media. When he checked into the Project 4 Program, as it is called, he registered as "Thomas Jackson." A nom de plume? That's right, Larry. He was there for a total of eight weeks, where he underwent detoxification and intensive treatment. As near as we've been able to determine, he had responded pretty well, and the doctors felt he could be released to resume his career. Now what drug or drugs was he addicted to? From my understanding Larry, it was PCP - "angel dust," I believe is a term used. OK, thank you John. Will get back to you a little bit later in the broadcast. Now for those of you who have just joined us, the top story of the hour, of course, is the death of singer/songwriter Jesse Thomas, who was killed earlier tonight in a freak accident, apparently related to PCP, or "angel dust." Joining us tonight in the studio now is Miss Michelle Lewis, who is an executive with the Crown Record Company. That's the label that Jesse Thomas was with, before his untimely death earlier this evening. Miss Lewis, thank you very much for coming on such short notice. Well, it's hard to believe that he's gone. I mean, I was just talking to him this morning, and we had to reschedule one of the sessions. Just he had everything going for him. His wife was expecting a baby. And he was looking forward to his new family. Yeah. What was Jesse Thomas like? What was he like? He was, he was a genius. I mean, you've heard his albums, he was just beginning to emerge as a genius. His last album, we of course we didn't get to finish. The songs and the orchestrations and the arrangements were pure innovation. Just pure genius. It would have been Tradewinds, yes. Well Tradewinds. Well, that's the one, that everybody in the industry said it was gonna be a total flop, even I had my concern about it but. Because Jess said, hey hang in there, you know, be cool. It'll be good and you're in good hands. And Tradewinds went platinum I believe. Oh yes, and as a matter of fact, within a month, we expect it to be a certified double platinum. Miss Lewis, when did the problem with PCP first become evident? When did he get "hooked" on it? When did it become evident, or when did we know about it? Well, which came first? We knew. We didn't know exactly what it was, but until Carolyn, his wife told us that it was PCP, but then we knew. I guess, you know, when things like that happen. You keep your eyes closed, you don't wanna know about it, yeah? I guess if we hadn't kept their eyes closed, we might have been able to do something about it. He'd be alive today. Miss Lewis, thank you very much for sharing your time and and your feelings with us. And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, our top story of the hour, the death earlier this evening of popular rock star Jesse Thomas, in a freak accident that authorities believe may be related to the drug PCP. This is Dick Ellenhorn, reporting to you from the funeral procession of Jesse Thomas. Just a few weeks ago, you'll recall we brought you the exclusive story of Jesse right after he signed his record contract. Today he is dead. This is a tragic end. To a great career that was just beginning. Everything seemed to be going great. And now this. All of his many fans and friends were shocked by his sudden death. Many of them are here today to pay tribute to young Jesse, who had so much to live for. His wife was unable to attend the funeral. As she was rushed to the maternity ward at Mercy Hospital. Jesse! It's a boy. How's the blood pressure? Here. Come on, put your flower down for daddy. Thank you. Go play. Hi baby, I couldn't forget your birthday. You know that. You know how sentimental I am. Your father's been. He's been spending a lot of time with Jesse Junior. He wanted to do the same thing with you. He really did. You'd be so proud of our baby. He's a lot like you. Got those same eyes. Same smile. I took him last week, for his first piano lesson and, he did really well. They said he had a lot of talent. Like his daddy. Yesterday I played the demo tape for him. He just danced and sang. The first time I played it since- Damn you, Jesse. Why did you leave us? This is so unfair. So cruel. He needs you, Jesse. He needs you so much. Would I lie to you? This is the wack, the chief angel. This stuff puts more dips in your hips, more cut in your strut, and more glide in your stride. This is a monster. Get hip to the wack! Stone cold cash. I love a man have no argument with money. There you go brother. Mama said, take a man, and treat him well with his cash. See. Tragic story, wasn't it? Jesse Thomas, the man with the plan, green lights on and everything. That was a characterization. But the story was real. The story said something. Said something about drugs, and drug abuse. Not just about PCP or "wack," as they call it. Or about that new drug I talked about, called "crack." Death Drug is just a dramatization. But Len Bias? Don Rogers? They were real. Their tragic deaths just magnified a monster: drug abuse. I get a sick feeling in my stomach when I think about it. What do you think that they would say if they were right here beside me? Len Bias, and Don Rogers? I tell you what they'd say. No matter how hard it gets. No matter how much your friends tell you how good things can be. How high you can get, so high man, that you need a parachute to come down and tomorrow man we're gonna be rocking and rolling and reeling. See with drugs, tomorrow never comes. My name is Philip Michael Thomas. Thank you for watching. Most important, thank you for listening. Play two brothers playing a deadly game right with mental and physical torture. Advised by the police of the murder of yet another hitchhiker, the body of 23 year old Janine Talbot of Middle Park was found less than an hour ago in the back stalls of the Rex Cinema. Chitam little brother. What on Earth have you been up to tell me, Inspector, do you think this is the work of the Miranda maniac? I'm afraid so forth and just every year victim is always a blonde and early 20s who is innocent and who is guilty. You will be guessing until a bizarre bloody end. Blonde ******. And at the last 10 miles worth. Better. And do you think this ones been sexually assaulted? None of them overall. The first three girls were picked up on the Moon to highway and killed within an hour or so, and then, for some inexplicable reason, deposited on the steps of the local police station. It's about Cheadle Robbie. You must make sure he hasn't got enough to arrest me. Oh yeah. You'll be safe. Dark, Moody, absolutely unpredictable. This time we do have a positive lead. Sergeant, we got the description. Do you love me? Damn weird way of showing it's going on over there. Got anything serious to say? Please say it just that there's no future for you and Mark. I'd like to impress on the public. This man is dangerous. If anyone suspects his identity or is foolhardy enough to be protecting him, I strongly advise them to contact the police immediately. Endplay is pure tension, exquisitely produced with a kind of nail biting suspense scene in death trap and wait until dark. End play from Academy Home entertainment.
