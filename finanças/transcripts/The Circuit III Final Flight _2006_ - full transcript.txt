How do you feel? >> I guess I'm okay, it's my first time getting shot. >> A room will open up soon. We just have to wait for the opportunity, okay? >> Opportunity, what do you mean? >> Just trust me. Here we go, are you ready? Let's go. [dramatic music] >> What if they come back? >> Don't worry, they're done with their business. >> Isn't this illegal? >> I guess so, now let's see your arm. You're bleeding too much, I'm gonna have to take the bullet out. >> Okay.>> Okay. Vodka should do it. It's going to hurt, so, be strong. I want you to bite on this.

Just my muscles are so weak, I feel like jello. >> Well you haven't used them for a year. >> Sykes, where am I? >> The FBI took you into protective custody. After the second attempt on your life by Pike's men. We didn't want any more attempts on your life. So the FBI, made sure everyone thought you were dead. >> So when's Dirk coming to see me? >> Nicole, he thinks you're dead. We all thought you were dead. >> But, Dirk wouldn't have believed it unless he... Well jut tell him, tell him I'm okay, and tell him to come and get me. >> When I found out you were alive, I tried to find Dirk. But he's gone. >> So, he still thinks I'm dead? We've gotta find him. >> I've got two of my best men, working on it right now. >> Mr. Octavio, she got away. >> So I hear. Where's Rivers? >> He's too embarrassed to come in. >> Who the hell is this guy? >> I dunno, I told you he was good. I think he's better than Webb. >> That's quite a statement. Do you think you could catch him alive? >> Yeah, if we find the girl. They have a little bond. I bet you he'd do anything for her. >> Where is he now? I don't know, we burned up his place. I got my eyes out in the motel district. A solid guy like him and a wounded girl shouldn't be hard to find. >> Wounded? >> Yeah, but it isn't fatal, she's alive. >> I want this guy, brought back here. Alive. If you kill him, then you might as well put a gun to your own head save me the trouble. [Mark screaming] Okay?>> Yes! Okay, okay, okay. I got it, I got it, alive. >> On second thoughts... [gun firing] I'll send someone more competent. [dramatic music] >> Thanks for everything, Dirk. I owe you. I'll be back. [rap music] >> No, no! Dirk! Help! Dirk! Help! >> Sherri? Sherri? Sherri? Sherri? Sherri? [dramatic music] >> Guys! We got her! [thugs cheering] >> There I go again, it's all my fault. >> Guys don't leave me, come on, Let me out of here! [heavy footsteps trodding] >> She was... >> Raped. Severely. Mr. Longstreet, I'm not gonna pull any punches with you, she could still leave us. Her coma is a result of a massive trauma, her body's shut down. >> I know the rules, Dirk. You want a shot at the champ, you win your way to the top. >> Fine. I will fight. [dramatic music] [engine starting] [dramatic music] >> No, no, we're not open. Hey! Hey, we're closed. >> Oh yeah? Where is Octavio? >> Nowhere!>> Yeah! >> Hey, we're closed. Hey! [guns firing] >> It looks like Longstreet is here. >> Don't hurt him, let him through. >> All right. Sir, he's here. >> We got him. >> Welcome Mr. Longstreet. Come on, Dirk, let's be civil. Remember the girl. >> Where's the kid? >> She's safe, for now. >> What are you talking about? >> Oh I have a lot of bids on that young lady. She's gonna be quite the eye candy in a year or two. >> She's just a kid. Why don't you come over here and show your face? >> In time, my man. >> Sure. >> Okay, that's enough. Americana, accompany Mr. Longstreet. >> Come with me, and I'll take you to her. >> That's enough, Americana.

By the way, my name is Octavio. >> Traces of blood were found around the burnt out van. And Malibu police are conducting a search for the owner, who is known to local surfers here as "The Monk." Officials will not confirm rumors that the man is traveling with a teenage girl, who may be the recent Laurel Canyon kidnapping case. Channel 5 has learned that this is not the first incident involving the unidentified man. Area residents say that they have witnessed several attacks against the occupants of this van, by unknown assailants. It may be days, even weeks before the police can piece together the clues to what happened here last night.>> Okay! But the key to this mystery seems to lie, with the man they're calling "Street Monk." Pauline Richards, Channel 5, Action News. >> You've got one minute. >> Sherri. >> Dirk! I'm sorry.

See, sometimes life gives you a gift and no matter how hard I try to avoid it, it won't leave me alone. So, I'm not going to avoid it anymore. How's your arm? >> Send me Suzy. >> We have a very special treat for you tonight.

Nothing gets done without my say so! >> Understood. What's this? >> Severance. >> What? >> Your gone, I no longer require your assistance. >> Oh, wasn't this the point where the goons come in and blow me away? >> Nope.
