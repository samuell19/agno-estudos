And um... - Every week? - Well... Not every day? Depends on, we're not a real busy hotel, so it just kind of depends on the clientele. Could you do me a favor and just try to keep my room very clean, okay? I appreciate that, sir, and if you have any problems, feel free to contact me here at the front desk and we'll get it squared away for you, okay? Place any good? Oh, yeah. Best burgers in town!

You just know people? Hey, buddy, am I treading on your turf, stud? No, no, no. 'Cause if I am, you know, like, let me know. - No, it's not... - I'll back off, you know. No, I, we have a platonic, professional, working relationship, we're co-workers. If you say so. Can I get you anything else, or are we good here, for now? I don't know, you got a menu? - You got a menu, like takeout? - No, we don't. We don't do menu stuff, here, at all. But I got chips, you want chips? Uh, maybe later. Okay, we're good. Yeah.

Let's you and me have a drink, or something. Daisy Do, Daisy Do, I love you. It's okay, Bubba, I'll be right out! Welcome to Pines Motel, my name is Charlie, can I help you? Hope so. I'm looking for someone who might've checked in recently. White male, mid-30s, may have signed in under the name John Doe. Sorry, can't give out personal info on guests. - Company policy. - Really? How about now? Detective Frye. Not without a warrant. Now, listen here, you fucking little midget. I can make your life more miserable than it already is, and this goes for the shithole of a hotel you got here, too. What? Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Listen, man, I'm... I'm sorry. Really. I shouldn't be taking my frustrations out on you. It's just this guy that I'm trying to find brings the kind of trouble you don't want in this town. And certainly not in your hotel. It's just there's a lot of innocent victims out there who deserve justice. Mm-hm. One of which is my daughter. Checked in a few days ago. Is he still here? As far as I know, yeah. Was he with anyone when he checked in? Nope, all by himself. Suppose you couldn't tell me his room number? - That, I can't do. - Understood. But, I can give you the room next to his. Now, you're a good man, Charlie Brent. All right, watch out for that guy. Thank you. Rest easy, detective Frye. Thank you. WoBabe, you're so handsome. What? - I love you. - I love you. Are you trashed? I can taste your bubble gum. Hi. Hi. What's her problem? - I don't know. - WoShe's so weird. Sorry to interrupt, but, you guys are just such a cute couple. Thank you. Fuck. She's so creepy. Who cares? You must not be from around here. Just passing through. WoWhy? - Do you think she's cute? - No. Are you kidding me? WoShe's still staring. Fuck off! She's fucking annoying. I'm tired of being alone. Sure, there's Bubba. But a girl has needs, you know? A brother can only do so much. Not like we're a couple a inbred, or anything, 'cause we're not, that's just plain sick. Fucking your brother, or your sister. Ha! Or your daughter. I mean... I'm cute, right? I'm in good shape. Why wouldn't a guy want a girl like me? What do you care? Little Miss Happy? You found your Mister Right. Oh, well! Nothing lasts forever. Calm down, now, shh. Shh. Come here, come here. Get a little lower. Stop, hey! I know. You can come home with me! I'm sure Bubba wouldn't mind. In fact, he'd love the company. Maybe he'll even let you stay with him in the basement! May I help you, man? Ah... Hey, you uh, got any pointy ends? Sorry, what? Pointy ends, you got 'em? You're asking me if I have "pointy ends"? Yeah. Yeah. I don't underst... Um... I'm gonna make this simple for you, okay? Uh... Ever use a toothpick on those yellow teeth of yours? Yeah. Yeah. Were they round or flat? Uh, I don't know. Wood, or plastic? Both, I guess. Did you ever notice how those plastic ones are so god damn sharp when you stick 'em in your mouth? If you're not careful, they cram you right in the gums and the tongue, and they just... They're like someone stabbing you in the face with a hypodermic needle, it's like... You ever notice that? But, at the same time, that pain feels good, in a weird way. You know? And uh... Gives you a kind of crazy little rush, so you just keep, you just keep poking your gums and tongue, your cheek, and... You just... Ah, fucking the pain is just so fucking good, man, you just can't get enough! Those, my friend, are called pointy ends. You got 'em? Sorry, man, we don't have plastic toothpicks, here. Fuck! All right. All right, just gimme a pack of the... The red death, the red one, the red, the red pack. Oh, shit. All right, this'll be $7.90. That's too, that's too much. This is too mu... That's too much. Keep it. Keep it. You gave me 10. Keep it. No, thank you. Thank you for your help. - That's too much. - Keep it. Oh! - WoOh, God! - Ah! WoI'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Thanks. I'm so sorry. This day has been a total disaster, let me buy you a new pack. Buy me a drink, instead. I mean... I mean, it's already beer 30, honey, let's go. Jeez. Hurt me three times. It's not about the drinks, though. You wear too much makeup. I don't need advice from you on my attire, all right? Just make my drinks, - for God's sake... - Just the eye shadow. Take it down, a little bit. You know, like, you're scaring the customers. Take it down? Yeah, a little bit. It's a little whorish, a little bit. Excuse me. Hey, what can I get ya? Yeah, I was wondering if you recall seeing a guy in here, recently. Uh, dark hair, kind of intense-looking fellow, likes his whiskey. No, I don't know, why? You a cop, or something? That makes a difference? Yeah, I'm a cop. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, there was a guy like that in here a couple nights ago. Uh, I don't know, he had a drink and then split. That it? I don't know, it was a busy night. He was in here, he had a drink, and then he split, I didn't talk to him at all. Yes you did! - When? - You had an entire conversation with him. I did not. When he asked you about Daisy? Oh, yeah. - He... - Who's Daisy? The other cocktail waitress. Cute. Real sweet. The guy was eyeballing her like nobody's business. - Is Daisy here? - No, she's off, tonight. Well, when's her next shift? Oh, day after tomorrow. Why all the questions? What's this all about? No particular reason. Nice talking to you. Yeah, well nice talking to you, too. I think that customer needs you... Oh, yeah, all right. Sorry. Thank you for your help, Miss. You have a good evening. You too. Yeah. Yeah. Not exactly how I thought I'd be spending the night. Nice little surprise, for me. Oh, I'm full of surprises, babe. Is that so? Yeah, that's right. Hang on. Damn. Hold on, right there. Ooh, whatcha got there, big boy? It's uh... It's a surprise. Oh, really? Roll over. I like surprises. That is freezing! Oh, are these chickens? Oh, no, those are roosters. I have two cocks fighting over my ass. Well, right now three. ♪ I've got two cocks ♪ Fighting over my ass ♪ I've got two cocks fighting ♪ Over my ass Whoo! ♪ My name's Caroline ♪ I drink too much wine - ♪ And now I got two - Three. ♪ Cocks ♪ Fighting over my ass ♪ Yeah Here we go. Here we go, fucking... That's beautiful. Hm. I absolve you, baby. Hey, Bubba, can I ask you something? Do you ever get bored, alone? Aside from Dad. I mean, someone else to call your own. To hold on to. Laugh with. To take care of. Never mind! You're right, it's silly. Better go get ready for work. Thanks for the pep talk, brother. If you were a good cop, then you'd know that breaking and entering is against the law. I know what you are, John Doe. You're a fucking pussy. Careful. Don't want to get too close to the flame, Detective Frye. You're standing in my room with your fucking shoes on! You're going down. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. Maybe. No, no, it's for real. You like tattoos, John? My daughter had a bunch of 'em. No. Didn't understand it, or her much at the time. 'Cause she was taken from me before I had a chance to realize what a great kid she was. She was a great kid, John. Her name was Dora. Means "God's Gift" in Spanish. That's deep, Frye. Yeah, real deep, huh? But you wouldn't know anything about God, would you, John? I am God. In your fucking dreams! Bye! Finishing up for the night? Yeah. After I wipe down these last few, I'm headed home. Oh, okay. Why don't you have a drink with me, instead? No, thanks. - No, thanks? - Mm-hm. No, thanks. I mean, you look like you could use a stiff one. You've been working all night, now here we are, and... What kind of stiff one? I, any kind. You know, I would love to. You know, the night is young, and we are beautiful. Like, what is... Yeah. Just one drink, please. - Just come. - You're kinda creepy. Have a drink with me! I totally appreciate the offer, but I said no, thanks, I can't, buzz off. Yes, you can. You can. I mean, just one, please. I mean, we'll have one drink. One, and we're done. Otherwise it's two, and we're through. Okay, two. But no more than that. Got it, Bob? Name's John. As in John the Baptist? Yeah. Something like that, yeah. Something tells me you ain't no saint. Well something's telling you the wrong shit. Fuck you! It's true, scout's honor. Like you were ever a scout. As a matter of fact, - There's no way. - I wa... - Don't even try it! - I was! You're looking at the bona fide scout's scout. I'm the most highly decorated member of my troop. You drop me off in the forest with a Band-Aid and a pack of matches, thank you, I'll make it home. I'm a nature boy to the core. Such a liar. And what possible reason would I have to lie? To get in my pants. Excuse me. All men lie to get laid, it's common knowledge. I never lie. You got a penis, right? Let me check. Yeah, I got a penis. Then you lie. Okay, okay, so if we're gonna go judging each other based on gross generalizations, then I guess it's fair to assume that because you've got these amazing tits I'm supposed to buy all the drinks, tonight. That's not fair, I got a round! What round? Uh... The next one. Hey! Another couple drinks over here when you get the chance, please. Whoo! Thank you, honey. Those drinks are on me. Huh. You cheated on me. You're a cheater. It was your idea, implying I have tits, and all. Which I do. But you'll never know. Hm, hm, hm. I'll drink to that. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. I'm gonna go piss. Thank you. My name's Crash, I'm gonna take a 15 minute shit, and go check that nobody's fucking my wife. Thank you. Hey, uh, can I? Can I play? Yeah? Hey, everybody, how you doing, tonight?

Look, I'm just going off what they tell me. Then you should stop talking to yourself. Well, what's that supposed to mean? It means my opinion is the only one that matters. Oh, yeah? Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah! Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Shit. Is that all you got? Want some of that? Andre the Giant? Or should I call you Stuart Little? I love it, I love it. I can't. I can't, I gotta go.

Hey, big fella. I brought you a little fresh meat. There we go. Hey, hey whoa, relax. I come in peace, my name's John, I'm a friend of Daisy's. Good friend, actually. Maybe she mentioned me? Maybe not. Big guy. Okay. Hey, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot, here. You know, Daisy tells me you're an amazing chef, and I, uh... If that's true, then that's another thing we got in common, because I love, gotta tell ya, I love some baby back ribs. And if that's true, in fact, then I think you know, maybe you could teach me a culinary thing, or two, you know? Like, what I would do with this big motherfucking pan! Hm, why not? You fat fucker. Oh, you guys, you guys are little fuck buddies, aren't you? There we go. Don't eat this. Bubba, I'm telling you, man, you gotta go on a fucking diet. You would've eaten him! Little fucker. Rest easy, Charlie. How you doing, Detective Handsome? It's Margo, right? You remember! Hey, did you hear about the murder? I did. I didn't know her personally, but she came in here every once in awhile. Seemed nice. What's up with that hairdo, though? I know, right? I heard she was stabbed like a gazillion times. Do you know who did it? No, who? Well, there was a... You're fucking with me, Detective. I am, just a little bit. - Is Walt working tonight? - No. Why, you think he did it? What about Daisy? They don't work on Sundays. Walt always gives 'em the same days off. Because he has a crush on her. Ooh. Would you happen to know where she lives? No. - No one does, not even Walt. - Hm. She's real private about that kinda thing. I heard her daddy left her a bunch of land somewhere out in the middle of nowhere. Supposedly, she commutes 30 minutes each way. Hm. So, no idea at all? Nope. Why? Do you think she did it? Thanks, Margo, gotta go. Daisy? Is that you? Hey, Daisy, my name is Detective Frye. I need to speak with you about John Doe. What about him? I think you may be in danger. Daisy. Oh, fuck. I'm sorry about that. But you shouldn't be trespassing on private property! Here's the deal. Now this arrow's gone and found its way straight through your jugular. You're gonna bleed out and there's nothing we can do about that, you understand me? Now, I don't know what you got against our boy John, here, but I can tell you he's on my shit list, too. But right now, it's movie night. So we're gonna have to deal with you in the mornin'. Bubba? Surprise, surprise! What the hell are you doing here? Uh, aren't you glad to see me? How do you know where I live? And who let you inside? Where's my brother? Where's... I gave him the night off. That is not funny, John. Where the hell is Bubba? Just relax, relax, okay? I was just joking. He's out back in the work shed. I brought him a little person... Present! I brought him a little present. Just calm down, all right? I thought this was more appropriate than whiskey? I'll take that. Okay. All right. Here we go. Cheers. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. You know, I gotta say, Bubba was a pretty hard sell, at first. He's very protective of you. But, then when I told him that you meant the world to me, and I would never do anything to hurt him, or you, and one day we could be brothers, I guess you could say that's when he spared my life. Really? Really. Really. And I mean, besides, look at me, right? I mean, I'm no match for Bubba. He's got me by like 500 pounds! - That's true. - Right? But still... Still what? Hey. Come here, come here. It's beautiful. Yeah. Here, have a seat, have a seat. You know, Bubba helped me so much. I could not have done this without him. I mean, I've been slaving over a hot stove all day, Daisy Do. And listen. This is my way of apologizing. I was a real jerk today, and I'm sorry. Yours. And mine. All right. Okay. Oh. Ladies first. Ooh! Mm. Like it? Mm-hm. You prefer it rare, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, you don't like it, do you? Yes, I do. No, it's all right. You don't like it, I can tell. - Here, I'll... - I do, John. It's just... Guys never made me dinner, before. Usually I make them dinner. Yeah. This is a first for me. You're the first, for me. Same here. And... And to think that you're almost the girl that got away? I don't think I coulda lived with that. Really? Really. I've never met anybody like you. You know, I mean, we're so much alike it's downright scary. What do you mean, "alike"? Our individual peculiarities. Our particular appetites. What are you talking about? You know, your little fetish, running around, chasing the guys around the woods. I'm curious, is it the hunt? The kill? Or eating them afterwards that gets you? You know, because for me... For me it's... It's not fucking every woman that I'm with. It's killing them afterwards. Slow, painful-like. You know, I like to see that last moment of their life just seep away from their desecrated bodies. But I digress. I mean, that's me, I like to kill. But you like to eat them afterwards. And you know, I'm not judging, I'm just saying. But eat up, darlin', there's lots more where that came from. Lots more. I know this is a lot to digest. You sick fuck! Me? I'm the sick fuck? I'm the sick fuck? The cannibal girl next door's calling me a sick fuck? I mean, you just ate your own fucking brother! Bubba? I'm afraid so. Uh-huh. Oh! Yeah. Oh, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba. And he did turn out pretty damn tasty, if I do say so, myself. Let me hold your hair back. Oh. Oh, get it out. That's better. That's better, honey. Okay? You bastard! All right, well save your energy, honey, 'cause we're just getting started. Why are you doing this to me? Because I thought you were different. I thought you were the one. But it turns out that... You're just like everyone else. Dirty. Filthy. What are you talking about? Who do you think you are, desecrating a beautiful gift from God, like that? What do you mean? You know what I'm talking about! That god damn, fucking tattoo on your other side. I can't even fucking look at it. It's driving me fucking crazy. What were you thinking? Please, John. I'll do whatever you want. I'll get the tattoo removed! It's too late. What's done is done. And besides, do you know what tattoos lead to? Tattoos lead to more tattoos. And I can't allow that. Please. Don't... Don't kill me. Oh, don't worry, Daisy Do. I'm not gonna kill ya any time soon. After all, I'm a gentleman. And god damn it, I believe in foreplay. ♪ When she's gone ♪ I'll carry on ♪ And if my heart longs ♪ I'll still have this song ♪ She's suffocating ♪ Eyes dilating ♪ Love and dating ♪ Is so frustrating ♪ She cries out ♪ And she cries out ♪ She cries out ♪ This is a dark day ♪ For Daisy ♪ This is a dark day ♪ For Daisy ♪ This is a dark day ♪ For Daisy I loved you so much. You're alive! Bubba, look at me. Calm down. Look, I got stabbed in the back, for crying out loud. I'm no match for John Doe. I need you, Bubba. But Daisy needs you more. Bubba, you can do it. Break those chains, come on! Come on, break them. Break those chains! Please. John. Find it in your heart to forgive me. What are you doing? I absolve you. Rip his head off! Come on, get him! Rip it off! Rest easy, Mister Doe. I always do. Bye! Hike! Get me out of here! Little fucker. Hey, let me out, you can't do this. Oh, is it? What are you doing? My first choice. Hey! Get me out of here! Is it the wrong one? - Somebody help me! - Fuck! Oh, hello. You're supposed to say, "arrow"! I'm sorry. Hey! Get me out of here! Somebody please help me! Fucking someone help me out, please. I mean Jesus. All right, so let's just pretend that you're a... 300 pound hermaphrodite with a small, little weird penis and a vagina, too? For crying out loud, somebody get a damn locksmith? 'Cause on the same days off, 'cause he has a crush on her. I fucked that up, didn't I? It might' a been me fucking up. - I think I fucked it up. - I don't know. Why don't we start over? - Great. - Sounds good. I'm like so, over dead by now. Boob, side boob! Ah! I need you, Bubba. Daisy needs you more. Break those chains! We just have one. Oh, sorry. Do this! My lawyer's gonna hear about this.
