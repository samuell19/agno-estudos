(MEN CHATTERING) (INAUDIBLE) MAN: Johnson! Yes, sir! - Honeycutt! - Here! - Melvin! - Here. Oh, man. Is that what I think it is? All right, you cheese dicks, welcome to the Nam. Follow me!

Warren, move Sanderson out on flank. - Say, Huffmeister! - Yo! - You got a smoke? - HUFFMEISTER: No, I'm out of those! Xin loi, man. HARRIS: Bravo Two-Six. What's the delay up on point? You having compass trouble again, Wolfe? (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) Come higher. Shit. (GRUNTING) - Get up. - Get up. BARNES: Get a move on, boy. (PANTING) (FLIES BUZZING) Boy, what you waiting for? Ain't gonna bite you. That's a good gook. Good and dead. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) (COUGHING) Cherry. Yo! Cherry! Two-five-two actual. Move it out. Six says we're jamming them up back there. Over. Tell that dipshit to get unfucked. WOLFE: This is Two-Five, be advised. We're moving out shortly. Out. What the hell's the matter with you, Taylor? You are one simple son of a bitch. I'm sorry, Sergeant. Get that other cherry up here. Gardner. - And the Doc. - Gardner! Doc! Up! Gardner and the Doc, to the front! To the front! Gardner, up. Gardner, get your ass up the hill, you fat fuck! Hurry up, bubble-butt! (GRUNTING) MAN ON RADIO: Pos rep follows. I, Shackle, Lima, Whiskey, Alpha, Whiskey, Foxtrot, Foxtrot, Echo, Whiskey, Shackle. You all right? Ants. I got ants all over my neck. You got some fucking red ants. Bites are killers. Black ants are the worst. Hurry up, lard-ass. - Better lose some weight. - Better hustle up, bacon. (MOCKINGLY) I'm so tired! (PANTING) Just a little. Don't drink too much. Look, I don't want you drinking any more. All right? I don't want you cramping up. You're humping too much stuff, troop. You don't need half this shit. I'll haul it for you, but next time you check with me first, all right? Okay. Thanks, Sarge. - All right, you okay? - Yeah. MAN ON RADIO.' TWO-TWO, this is Six. I understand you have a bird inbound at your pos at this time. RTO: Bravo Six, Bravo Six, be advised. Resupply helo is inbound at this time. Over. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) MAN: Come on, you people! Get ready. Get that ammo off now! Move it! (KING HUMMING) It ain't D-E-R-E, it's D-E-A-R. And Sarah ain't got no two "R"s, King. Damn, you dumb! It don't make no difference. She know what I mean. She don't read too good nohow. (HUMMING) JUNIOR: Look at this shit! Pork again! Man, why don't you let me have that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man? Just today. I can't eat this shit, Harold! What you been smoking, Junior? I hope you don't get that laundry gig. I hope Manny get it. 'Cause your ass need to hump, hump, and hump. Hey, white boy, what you waiting for? That hole ain't gonna dig itself. Come on, boy. Get your dick skin on that thing! Dig! We ain't got all day! Dig! Dig! CHRIS: Somebody once wrote, "Hell is the impossibility of reason." That's what this place feels like. Hell. I hate it already, and it's only been a week. Some goddamn week, Grandma. The hardest thing I think I've ever done is go on point. Three times this week. I don't even know what I'm doing. A gook could be standing three feet in front of me, and I wouldn't know it. I'm so tired. We get up at 5:00 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4:00 or 5:00, dig a foxhole, eat. Then put out an all-night ambush or a three-man listening post in the jungle. It's scary, 'cause nobody tells me how to do anything 'cause I'm new. Nobody cares about the new guys. They don't even want to know your name. The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much 'cause he hasn't put his time in yet. And they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam, it's better to get it in the first few weeks. The logic being you don't suffer that much. If you're lucky, you get to stay in the perimeter at night, and then you pull a three-hour guard shift. So, maybe you sleep three, four hours a night, but you don't really sleep. I don't think I can keep this up for a year, Grandma. I think I made a big mistake coming here. We've got beaucoup movement. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) The third battalion just got hit 15 klicks north of here. Charlie had claymores strung up in the trees. Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. Bad shit. (MEN CHATTERING) Yeah, they got two lieutenants and a captain. Jesus. All right, Sergeant, who do you want on ambush? Elias, you take your squad out. Warren, you stay in, but I need Tex and Junior from your squad. Roger that. Okay, move out in two-zero mikes. I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight. No,no,no,no,no,no. Tubbs and Morehouse are short. Fu Sheng's going on an R&R tomorrow, and you want to send them out on an ambush? You got the fresh meat, buddy. They don't know shit, Barnes, and chances are we're gonna run into something. Think about it. O'NEILL: That's just great, Bob, and what do you want me to do? Send one of my guys out to get zapped so some lame-ass just in from the world can get his beauty sleep? No. Hey, O'Neill, take a break. You don't have to be a prick every day of your life, you know. Elias, get your men ready. Guy's in three years, he thinks he's Jesus fucking Christ or something. O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out. I need veterans out there. Sergeant Barnes. Sergeant. I think, in front of the men, it's necessary for me to give the orders. Yes, sir. TEX: Shit, looks like it's gonna rain. Man, it's gonna piss on us all night. Gonna put a serious case of crotch rot on that your ugly face of yours, Junior. Goddamn, man. You break your ass for the white man. No justice, right? What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already? How come we always get fucking ambush? 'Cause it's politics, man, politics. Hey, Chris, did I show you a picture of Lucy Jean? No, you didn't. She's the one for me, all right, that Lucy Jean. - And she's waiting for me, too. - Yeah, she's real pretty. You're a lucky guy, Gardner. - Hey, you got a picture of your girl? - No. I guess that leaves some unlucky girl back at home, don't it? Tuck this in. Shitcan this. Don't need this. Turn around. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) Come on. Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here on your position. God damn it, Elias, don't mess with my pig. I ain't getting greased on this bush tonight, so you keep this sorry cheese-dick off my ass. You got Taylor. Gardner, you're with me. Look, case anything happens to you, you get lost or separated, -don't yell out, okay? - Okay. - Just sit tight, and we'll get to you. - All right. Yo! Saddle up! Lock and load! (GUNS CLICKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (RAIN PATTERING) CHRIS: Of course, Mom and Dad didn't want me to come here. They wanted me to be just like them, respectable, hard-working, a little house, a family. They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, Grandma. You know Mom. I guess, I mean, I've always been sheltered and special. I just want to be anonymous, like everybody else. Do my share for my country. Live up to what Grandpa did in the first war, and Dad did in the second. Well, here lam, anonymous, all right. With guys nobody really cares about. They come from the end of the line, most of them, small towns you never heard of. Pulaski, Tennessee. Brandon, Mississippi. Pork Bend, Utah. Wampum, Pennsylvania. Two years high school's about it. Maybe if they're lucky, a job waiting for them back in a factory But most of them got nothing. They're poor. They're the unwanted. Yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom. It's weird, isn't it? They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it. Maybe that's why they call themselves grunts, 'cause a grunt can take it, can take anything. They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma. The heart and soul. Hey, Taylor. Hey, cheese-dick, you're up. - What? - You're up. You sure you know how to work the claymores, dude? Yeah. I'm sure. Flick the safety off and bang on that sucker three times. Three times. I got it. And don't catch any "Z"s on me, buddy, or I'll sling your sorry ass. - You hear me? - Okay. CHRIS: Maybe I finally found it, way down here in the mud. Maybe from down here I can start up again. Be something I can be proud of without having to fake it, be a fake human being. Maybe I can see something I don't yet see or learn something I don't yet know. I miss you. I miss you very much. Tell Mom I miss her, too. Chris. Junior. Junior. Hey. All right, motherfucker! It's your shift, man! Okay? Here, take this. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (FLIES BUZZING) (MAN SNORING) (FLIES BUZZING) (HEART BEATING LOUDLY) TEX: Blow the fucking claymorel Take the safety off! Goddamn it. - Drop it! - Take the safety off, boy! Feed me, Junior! Get over here and feed me! MAN ON RADIO: Bravo Two, Bravo Two, we... (SCREAMS) My fucking arm! My fucking arm! - Jesus fucking Christ! My arm! - Easy, Tex! Easy, boy! I'm getting you medicine. (AGONIZED SCREAMING) HAROLD: Doc, over here. Gardner's hit! - Be right there! - Oh, shit. I'm hit! HAROLD: Doc, he's hit, too. JUNIOR: Taylor's hit! - Taylor's hit! - Oh, shit. Doc. CHRIS: How bad is it, Doc? That dumb fuck didn't blow his claymorel DOC: Just relax, man, it's a scratch. Hold this on here. Don't lie to me, Doc! How bad is it? He let them walk right up on us. He was sleeping on his goddamn shift! No, I did not. DOC: Big Harold, you keep an eye on him. You don't let him go into shock. Shut up! Shut up and take the pain! Take the pain! (PANTING) MAN ON RADIO: Redleg, Redleg, Bravo Six. I have NDPs at this time. Over. (CICADAS CHIRPING) Hey, little guy, you're gonna be okay. Okay? Don't worry. Big Harold. Do you know if... If you're gonna die? Do you feel like everything's just gonna be fine? Don't give me that morbid bullshit. We're about to get out of here. They gonna give you three hot meals a day, white sheets. Them pretty white nurses, they gonna give you blowjobs if you pay them enough. I heard all about them white bitches. Don't baby-talk him, man! The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them walk right up on us and he don't do shit! Just shut up, Junior. You relax, okay, man? Okay. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) It's not so bad, dying. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) How long is... How long is... (WHEEZING) DOC: Come on, bird's on the way, man. Hang in there! You're gonna make it! (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Come on, Gardner, hang in there! You're gonna make it. Come on! Don't quit! Come on, Gardner! Help me! Don't give up! (SPITS) Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit. Remember what it looks like. You fuck up in a firefight and I goddamn guarantee you a trip out of the bush in a body bag! Out here, assholes, you keep your shit wired tight at all times! And that goes for you, shit-for-brains. You don't sleep on no fucking ambush! And the next son of a bitch I catch copping "Z"s in the bush, I'm personally gonna take an interest in seeing him suffer. I shit you not. Doc, tag him and bag him. I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant. - It was Junior. - Shut your face, chicken shit. You in big trouble, boy. Excuses are like assholes, Taylor, everybody got one. ELIAS: Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags. Don't leave nothing for the dinks. Junior, Tony, carry Gardner. The man would be alive if he had a few more days to learn something. KING: Hey, Taylor. What's in the breeze? - Okay, got light duty. Three days' worth. - No shit! - Yeah. - Well, too bad we in base camp anyway. - What you got, beers? - Yeah. Just stole me some from the Top's supply. Yeah? Shit, he been stealing it from us anyway. Hey, Taylor! What, are you back? Yeah, it looks like it. Hey, King, where'd you get those beers, boy? - KING: I found it. - Oh, you found it. You going on report, son, now. Yeah, both of you come with me. I got a little job for you. (LAUGHS) MAN ON RADIO: Good morning, Vietnam. Motherfucker! This is the bright sound in the a.m. Motherfucker! I'm too short for this shit, man. They always fucking with us! No letup. Politics, man. Fucking politics. That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio. Thirty-nine and a wake-up, a pause for the cause, and I'm a gone motherfucker! - Back to the world! - I hear you, man. - Broke 100 the other day. - No shit. Ninety-two left to go. April 17, heroes, man. Home to California. I'll be sitting outside, checking out the babes on the beach. The surfing's gonna be good. (LAUGHING) March, man, in Tennessee. Sniff the pines. Sniff that cross-mounted pussy down by the river. (WHOOPS) Hot damn! Hey, Taylor, how long you got left? - Three hundred and what? - Thirty-two. Three hundred and thirty-two days. KING: Xin loi, my boy! I can't even remember when I was 332, man. You gotta, like, count backwards or something. You know, like, you got 40 days in. I mean, think positive, dude. Hey, Taylor. How in the fuck you get here anyway? - Why, you look educated. - I volunteered for it. You did what? I volunteered. I dropped out of college, and told them I wanted the infantry, combat, and Vietnam. CRAWFORD: You volunteered for this shit, man? You believe that? You's a crazy fucker, giving up college. It didn't make much sense. I wasn't learning anything. I figured why should just the poor kids go off to war and the rich kids always get away with it? Oh, I see. What we got here is a crusader. CRAWFORD: Sounds like it. Shit. You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that. Everybody know the poor always being fucked over by the rich. Always have, always will. KING: I tell you what, if you be cool, I introduce you around to some of the heads. CHRIS: What are the heads? KING: Later, man. (LAUGHS) (WHITE RABBIT PLAYING) What's up, brother? Your highness has arrived. Hey, what's happening? CRAWFORD: Man, I thought you was hanging 10 in Cambodia. KING: Come on, man. How's it going? What you doing in the underworld, Taylor? Well, this here ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man here is Chris. He been resurrected. You lame, Taylor? - Am I what? - Are you lame or something? Go ahead, old man. Smoke it.

Free your mind, your ass will follow. Yeah, I can dig it, man. You smoke that shit, everything kind of gets weird. You know what I mean? You hear that story about the gooks putting chemicals in the grass, so we don't fight, so we become pacifists? Hey, but don't you worry, Bunny, 'cause you's a killer anyway, man. Yeah, but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while. Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy except maybe the Indy 500.

This guy is easily three, four times my size. - Come on, man. - No. No. 'Cause I got him in the O'Neill death grip. He didn't know whether to shit or go blind, for Christ's sake. - Hey, what do you say there, L.T.? - How you doing there, Red? Not good. Not good. This cocksucker's got every card in the deck. Full house. Look like you're doing all right there, Sergeant. Yeah, and I ain't even cheating yet. Hey, Lieutenant, some Kentucky windage? Thanks, Sandy. Play, Lieutenant?

Yeah! Oh, yeah! I need you Need you Need you CHRIS: New Year's Day, 1968. Just another day, staying alive. There's been a lot of movement near the Cambodian border. Regiments of N VA moving across. A lot of little firefights, ambushes. We drop a lot of bombs, then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape. (CICADAS CHIRPING) (BIRDS TWITTERING) Bunker Where? BARNES ON RADIO: Bravo Two, Bravo Two-Five. We got beaucoup bunkers up here. Over. MAN ON RADIO: Two-five-two, roger. Bunkers at point. Two actuals on the way.

Manny, where you at? CHRIS: We had to get to the village before dark. So we left Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers. But it was King who found him, about 1,000 yards downriver, not far from the village. It was the end of the mystery. The motherfuckers. CHRIS: The village, which had stood for maybe 1,000 years, didn't know we were coming that day. If they had, they would have run. Barnes was at the eye of our rage. And through him, our Captain Ahab. He would set things right again. That day, we loved him. (PIG GRUNTING) (YELLING IN VIETNAMESE) There he goes, Sarge. (GUN FIRING) - Check him out. - Yeah. You got it, Sarge.

Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank? (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) He doesn't know. He says that the NVA ain't been around in a couple of months. Look, maybe he was a scout or something, Sarge. Yeah, sure, a scout. What about the fucking rice and the weapons? Who are they for? (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) That cocksucker knows what I'm saying! He understands. Don't you, pop? - Goddamn right he does. - You bet. Damn it! He's lying through his teeth. Come on! Waste the fucker, then see who talks. The boy doesn't fucking know anything.

That dink was reported to me as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir. My report, sir, will include Lieutenant Wolfe as being witness to the shooting. All right, Elias. - Staff Sergeant Barnes? - Sir! I want a full report from you on this when we get back to the CP. You got it, Dai-'Uy, and I can throw in plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir. Not now, god damn it! Not now. We'll get into this when we get back to the base camp. And I can promise you something. If I find out there was an illegal killing, there will be a court-martial. Right now I need every man in the field, and you two will ceasefire. Staff Sergeant Barnes, Sergeant Elias, you hear me? - Yes, sir. - BARNES: Yes, sir. Now, we're going back into that NVA bunker complex tomorrow. This time from the East. You people get some rest and be back up here at the CP at 1900 for a briefing. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Come on, man. You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me? It could just as well have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way. And that Bunny, that motherfucker's crazy. I mean, he scares me, man. He just scares me. Look, you bloods are getting too hung up on all this shit. These gooks are a lot smarter than you think. You know, Barnes knows his shit, man. They was NVA, every last one of them. Now, he's taken us this far, right? He'll take us the rest of the way. I don't know. I mean, a Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit. This shit is really getting out of hand, man. It's going way out of control. It seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference, the way you shoot up that shit all the time. I don't know, brothers, but I'm hurting real bad inside. Don't worry about it, Sergeant. Elias won't be able to prove a thing. - I mean, he's a troublemaker, but... - Elias is a water-walker, like them politicians in Washington trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls. Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here. MAN: Come on, let's go. - Sarge. - Thanks, Bun. How'd it go there, Bob? (GRUNTS DISMISSIVELY) Yeah. Atta way, Sarge. Fucking Elias, man. He's a fucking rat, that's what he is. He's gonna get everybody in this platoon in deep shit. Somebody ought to frag his ass. So, what do you think there, Bob? Gonna be an investigation or what? Bob? BUNNY: O'Neill, man, you worry too much. Sarge will take care of it. (BIRDS CHIRPING) CHRIS: It's a beautiful night. ELIAS: Yeah. I love this place at night, the stars. There's no right or wrong in them. They're just there. That's a nice way of putting it. Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he? Barnes believes in what he's doing. And you? Do you believe? In '65, yeah. Now, HO. What happened today is just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war. Come on. You really think so? Us? We been kicking other people's asses for so long, I figure it's time we got ours kicked. CHRIS: Day by day, I struggle to maintain not only my strength but my sanity. It's all a blur. I have no energy to write. I don't know what's right and what's wrong any more. The morale of the men is low. A civil war in the platoon. Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes. There's a lot of suspicion and hate. I can't believe we're fighting each other when we should be fighting them. Counting days and the six inches in front of my face. Not much else. Hope things are well, Grandma. Tell Mom and Dad I... Well, just tell them. Chris. Hey, big boy. I know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out. Hell, I got to paint myself white just to get me one of them fucking jobs. It's all right. I got my request in for a circumcision. I'm gonna get my big ass out of this fucker. KING: You gonna become a rabbi? KING: What you gonna do with that little flap, boy? Leech. All right! Move it out! Don't drink that, asshole. You're gonna get malaria. Yeah, I hope so. Let's go. (MACHINE GUN FIRING) Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit! Sergeant Warren's hit! What the fuck's going on? They got RPGs man, it's an ambush! They were just fucking waiting for us here! - Who's on point? - Lerner and Warren! Taylor, where you going? MAN: Dig! Dig! Down! God damn it, you assholes! Get some firepower up there! Right! Watch out! Rockets! (MACHINE GUNS CONTINUE FIRING) CHRIS: Where the fuck's Lerner? He's over there, by the log! (MACHINE GUNS CONTINUE FIRING) (ROCKET WHIZZING) (MACHINE GUNS CONTINUE FIRING) Fire mission. Grid. 6-4-9-4-0-2. Direction. 6-1-0... Adjust fire, over. Lieutenant, they're gonna get in tight under the arty! I spotted a cut over there. Let me get some men and roll up that flank. I can work right up on them. Get me Barnes. Look, Elias, I don't know. We got four down up there. What do you want me to do? Where the fuck is Red platoon? Tell those assholes to get up here! Elias, what the fuck are you doing back here? Listen to me, Barnes, there's holes back here. (EXPLOSION) Third platoon's coming up here. We're here. Dinks get men in these holes, they got us caught in a crossfire. We'll shoot each other to shit. Sounds pretty far-out to me, Elias. I've seen it happen, la Drang in '66. They cut us to fucking pieces! I need three men! Then you got them. Take off. You keep pouring off that cover fire. I don't wanna be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze. You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias! Now, you go crying and rat fucking the brigade on your own time! But out here, you belong to me! Now move! You're an asshole, Barnes! Sergeant, get that asshole O'Neill up here. Two Charlie, this is Two! Be advised... (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (INAUDIBLE) Stay down! Stay down! - Ammo! - Ammo! Be right back! (RUSTLING) Sarge! Short round! (SCREAMING) Medic! (SCREAMING) - God! - Medic! BUNNY: Satchel charge! Doc! - Doc, help me out! - Yeah. CHRIS: Jesus! (WAILING) - You okay? - Don't leave me, man. - All right. - Don't leave me. Hey, Gator, you're gonna be okay, man. Don't leave me, man. - CHRIS: You'll be okay. - Here you go, man. CHRIS: Hang in there. - Drop your rucks. - Just hang in there. Taylor, you're coming with us. LERNER: Please, don't go. - You're gonna be okay. - Come on! Doc! Take care of him, man. WOLFE: Redleg, Redleg, Ripper Bravo Two actual. Adjustment follows. Grid. (EXPLOSION) You ignorant asshole! What the fuck coordinates you giving? You wasted a lot of people up there with your fucked-up fire mission! You know that? You know that? Shit! Redleg. Redleg. Ripper Bravo Two. Check your fire! Check your fire! They're coming. Stagger yourself across this line. Shoot anything that moves. - They'll be coming from over there. - RHAH: Gotcha. Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked. Where the hell are you going? Down by the river, about 100 meters, in case they try to flank us. Third platoon's coming up to our rear, so watch for them. Hey. Can I go with you? No. I move faster alone. Come here. Let's let arty do a little bit of the work here. We tell everybody to pull back to the church. We link up with third platoon. You got that? What about Elias? If we pull back, he'll be cutoff. You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant. (EXPLOSION) I'll get him. (CHATTERING ON RADIO) (PANTING) - I got two of them fuckers, man. - I got one! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick! (WHOOPING) Crawford ! Oh, man! - Kiss my ass. I never thought I'd get hit. - It's a lung, babe. You got two of them fuckers. Where's Elias? Sarge, there's a bunch of gooks came through there. We got three of them fuckers. Hey, didn't you hear the arty shift? We're pulling back. Now, get your wounded man and get the fuck back to the church. Get going- - But Elias is still out there, Sarge. - Taylor, I'll get him! You get Crawford in now, before I article 15 both your asses. Move! Move it. (GUN FIRING) (GUN FIRING) (GUN FIRING) (GUN FIRING) (SCREAMING) (GUN FIRING) SOLDIER 1: All right, men. He's coming. SOLDIER 2: Hold him down. Medic, where the fuck are you? Drag him there. It's gonna be all right in a minute, brother. RHAH: Taylor, where you going? Elias is dead. Fall back with the platoon. - Get going. - He's dead? Yeah. Yeah, he's back there about 100 meters. - You saw him? Where? - He's dead. And there's gooks all over the goddamn place. Get moving. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) Let's go. Move it! Move it! Okay, let's go! You okay, Harold? You're on the next one. You're okay, bud. Fuck! - They got Elias! - What? Back down! Back down there! MAN ON RADIO: Snake one-niner, fly four, there's still one on the deck down there. Bring in the gunships, over. Hold your armor! Guns! Guns! Pull off! Pull off! We're trying to come around my side. He killed him. I know that he killed him. I saw his eyes when he came back in. How do you know the dinks didn't get him? You got no proof, man. Proof's in the eyes, man. When you know, you know. You were there, Rhah, and I know what you were thinking. I say we frag that fucker tonight. I go with that. An eye for an eye. I say let Military Justice do the job on him. Come on. Fuck the Military Justice! Are you joking me? Whose story you think they're gonna believe? O'Neill's? Bunny's? Wolfe's? Bullshit! Shit, man, you try that and Barnes will shove it right back up your ass with a candle on it. Well, then what do you suggest we do, huh? I suggest you all watch your own asses, because Barnes gonna be coming down on all of them. You just gonna forget about Elias and all the good times we done had right in here? Shit. You're trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him. If there's a heaven, and God I hope there is, I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit, 'cause he done left his pains down here. You're wrong, man. Any way you cut it, Barnes is a fucking murderer. KING: Right on. Taylor, I remember when you first came in here telling me how much you admired the bastard. I was wrong. Wrong? You ain't never been right about nothing! And dig this, you assholes, and dig it good... Barnes been shot seven times and he ain't dead. Does that mean anything to you, huh? Barnes ain't meant to die. The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes. BARNES: Talking about killing? Y'all experts? Y'all know about killing? I'd like to hear about it, potheads. Why do you smoke this shit? So as to escape from reality? Me, I don't need this shit. I am reality. There's the way it ought to be. And there's the way it is. Elias was full of shit. Elias was a crusader. Now, I got no fight with any man who does what he's told, but when he don't, the machine breaks down. And when the machine breaks down, we break down. And I ain't gonna allow that in any of you. Not one. (SPITS) Y'all love Elias. Oh, you wanna kick ass. Yeah. Well, here I am, all by my lonesome, and ain't nobody gonna know. Six of you boys against me. Kill me. (SIGHS DISGUSTEDLY) I shit on all of you. You motherfucker! KING: Give it to him! Whoop his ass. Come on. Yes, man. - Come on, man! Go. - Get him! - Oh, fuck, come on. - Get him, Chris. Come on. Come on, boy! Come on! Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man. You'll go dinky down in LBJ, man. Ten years for killing an enlisted man. Ten years, you'll climb the fucking walls, man. Don't do it. (GROANS) Death? What do you all know about death? CHRIS: They sent us back into the valley the next day about 2,000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter. It felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime. Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable force, and Charlie Company had been probed that night. There were other battalions in the valley. We weren't the only ones. But we knew we were gonna be the bait to lure them out. Somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA regiment. Caught those motherfuckers trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night. They found maps on them, man. Got a friend at battalion, says they had every fucking foxhole here fixed on it. Distances, tree-lines, our claymores, everything. This is bad, man. I got bad vibes here. I also heard we're in fucking Cambodia right now. Cambodia? Man, you kidding me. You wanted to see me, sir? Yeah, Ramucci. Looks like you got Elias' squad now. Squad, sir? I didn't know we were still referring to this platoon in terms of squads. All right, look. I want you to take those two holes right there and there. You're tying it off with Barnes up here, King down there. Yeah. Begging your pardon, sir. My two holes are far enough apart you can run a regiment through them and never see them. I have five live bodies left, sir. Look, I don't wanna hear your problems, Ramucci. You'll get new men any day. Meantime, you make do like everybody else. Okay? - I didn't ask for this job. - I don't want to hear it. - Oh, you don't wanna hear it? - Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell the truth, I don't give a shit, okay? - I just don't give a flying fuck any more. - Right. (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) I'm glad I ain't going with them. Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight. What a fucking bummer. Ten days and a wake-up, and I'm still dealing with this shit. What's the matter with you, man? How come you ain't writing nobody? What about your folks? That grandma you was telling me about? Girl? You got a mother and father, don't you? There must be somebody. Nah, there's nobody. You been smoking too much of this shit, troop. Gotta control that. Bring a man down. I remember when you first come out here, to the bush. You was green as a... Did you ever get caught in a mistake that you just can't get out of, King? There's a way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry, and the world will turn. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) How many days you short? Nah, it's not just me. It's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted. People like Barnes just go on making up the rules any way they want. So what do we do? Sit in the middle and suck on it. We just don't add up to dry shit, King. Whoever said we did, man? All you got to do is make it out of here, and it's all gravy. Every day, the rest of your life, gravy. Oh, shit, superlifer. Hey, King, collect up your shit. Your orders just come through. Now look, man. Don't fuck with me. What do you need, a written invitation, for Christ's sake? Cocksucker! Oh, wow! The lifers have made a mistake. They cut me some slack, Taylor. Look, you get your freight to Rodriguez. You got 10 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here, man, 'cause if you're not on it, I'm gonna be. Taylor, Francis is coming up. That's great, King. I'm happy for you, man. - You take it on home for me, okay? - Yeah. You got my address. You know where you can get a hold of me anytime, right? I gotta beat it, man. I don't want to miss that chopper. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Remember now, take it easy. Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool. Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here. Don't mean nothing. My man. I'll walk you out, man. Take it easy, King. I'm gonna take it any way I can get it, brother. I hear you. Later. I'm pretty fucked up, Sarge! Oh, man! Don't touch that. I got to get on a chopper, man. So what's the problem? Says he can't walk. Shit. Martin, get your boots on. And the next time I catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your fucking feet, I'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass. Well, then court-martial me, motherfucker! Bust my ass. Send me to fucking Long Binh! You do your fucking worst! You white folks have got your last klick out of Junior! - O'Neill, get me that centipede. - Sergeant? Yeah, that long, hairy, red and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch, see if he can walk. I remember now. Hey. Now hold up, man! You just hold up and wait, all right? Fuck it! I'll walk! I'll fucking walk, man! Fucking pussy, man. Hey, Sarge, I got to have him in my hole? Yeah. Bob, I'd like to speak to you a minute. (WEEPING) I can't take it no more. - I'd like to speak to you, Bob. - Yeah, what is it? Bob, I got Elias' R&R. It's coming up in three days, here. I was thinking about going to Hawaii, maybe see Patsy. Hey, Bob, come on, I never asked you for a fucking thing over here. You know, I was thinking maybe... Well, to be honest with you, I was hoping you'd put me on that chopper with King out of here. What do you say, chief-a-rooney? I can't do that for you, Red. We need every swinging dick in the field, and you know that. Hey, Bob, come on. You can talk to me, for Christ's sake. All I'm asking for is three fucking days, here. I am talking to you, Red, and I'm telling you "no." So get back in your foxhole. Bob, I got a bad feeling on this one, all right? I mean, I got a bad feeling. I don't think I'm gonna make it out of here. You understand what I'm saying to you? Everybody got to die sometime, Red. Oh, shit. Goodbye, motherfuckers! (EXPLOSIONS) (GUNS FIRING) Where's that fucking ambush? They ain't even waiting till later. It's fucking coming now, man. Right fucking now. You know, Junior, some of the things we done, man... I don't feel like we done something wrong. But sometimes, man, (GUNS FIRING) I get this bad feeling. (MEN CHATTERING IN VIETNAMESE) I told the Padre the truth, man. I like it here. You get to do what you want. Nobody fucks with you. The only worry you got is dying. And if that happens, you won't know about it anyway. So what the fuck, man. Shit, I got to be in this hole with you, man? I just know I shouldn't have come. Don't you worry, Junior. You're hanging with Audie Murphy here, my man. Bravo Three, Bravo Three, Bravo Six, send me a grid. Send me a grid. Over. (GUNS FIRING) MAN: Can't, sir. Pinned down. They're in the fucking trees. Okay, Three Alpha, now calm down, son. I'll get you a fire mission ASAP. Smoke will be first. Lieutenant's dead. Radioman looks dead, sir. I don't know where the map is, Captain! They're all around us, sir, hundreds of them!

(JET ENGINES ROARING) (GUNS FIRING) Three Alpha Six. How about those rounds, son? Can you adjust fire? Over. Three Alpha Six. If you can't talk, son, just key your handset twice. Over. (RADIO CUTS OFF ABRUPTLY) Shit. (MAN CHATTERING IN VIETNAMESE) Trip flare! Rodriguez's hole! RPG! RODRIGUEZ: Doc, Doc! RHAH: Taylor, Francis. Over here, man. What the fuck's going on? Rodriguez's hole just got nailed, man! Gooks, man. We got gooks in the fucking perimeter. Oh, shit! That's it. They got through Alpha Company. Anything behind you don't identify itself, fucking blow it away, okay? Fuck! Two, air strike's coming in. They're gonna be laying snake and nape. Don't get out of your fucking hole. Stay right here, man. Fuck. (MACHINE GUNS FIRING) They're probing us. They're gonna be going up and down this line all night trying to get through. All right. Stay here. Stay cool. I'll be right back. MAN ON RADIO: Whiskey, Foxtrot, Foxtrot, Echo, Whiskey. Over. (WHISPERING) Who is it? (GUNS FIRING) Don't shoot! Don't shoot! It's the ambush. Over here, man. Hurry.

You guys, get out of here! They're right on my ass! They ain't stopping for shit! Hey, Taylor, man, let's didi. You go. (PANTING) (GUN FIRING) There! (PANTING) No. Hold it. Hold it.

Francis, move your fucking ass! They're gonna fucking... (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (SHOUTS) (BOTH PANTING) (MEN SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE) - Follow me. - Wait. Die, you motherfuckers! (SCREAMING) Get back! (SHOUTING) It's fucking beautiful! - Let's fucking do it! - Where are you going? - All right! - Now come on, motherfuckers! (MAN CHATTERING IN VIETNAMESE) Come on. You can do better than that! They just keep coming, man! Fuck this shit! Get back here, you gutless shit! (MAN SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE) (SHOUTING) (GROANS) (SHRIEKS) (MAN CHATTERING IN VIETNAMESE ON RADIO) (GRUNTING) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) All right. Get me Bravo. Right away. Charlie Company reports hand-to-hand on perimeter, sir. Three holes are down. They need help. Okay. Get two squads from Alpha down there right away. Go. Go. Where's that goddamn air strike?

Bravo Six! Bravo Six! Oh, God! Get him in! They're coming through all over! I can't do anything! Where's Barnes? Shit, he's dead! I think they're all dead. Doc, he's dead. Six, LT, Six. Captain. Captain, we've been overrun. We're pulling back! Over. God damn it, Lieutenant. Where are you gonna pull back to? They're all over the perimeter. Now you be advised. You will hold in place, and you will fight. That means you, Lieutenant. Bravo Six out. (ALL SHOUTING) (MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO) Be advised. We've got zips in the wire down here. PILOT: Roger your last, Bravo Six. Can't run it any closer. We're hot to trot and packing snake and nape but we're bingo on fuel. For the record, it's my call. Dump everything you've got left on my pos. I say again, expend all remaining in my perimeter. It's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out. PILOT: Roger your last, Bravo Six. We copy. It's your call. Get them in their holes down there. Hang tough, Bravo Six. We're coming cocked for treetops. (MEN GRUNTING) (GROANING) (JET ENGINES ROARING) Barnes! Barnes! (BARNES GRUNTS) No! (BIRDS TWITTERING) (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) Get me a medic. Go on, b()y! Do it. MAN: We got men wounded and live gooks at 3 o'clock. MAN 1: Look down here. Check them out. Come on, Elmo.

We two timers, man. We're gonna get out of here, boy. I'm gonna see you in the hospital. We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir. CAPTAIN: Sergeant O'Neill. - How you doing? - Well, I'm just fine, sir. Well, that's good. 'Cause you got second platoon. Yes, sir. - You ready? - You bet. (GRUNTING) CHRIS: I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy. We fought ourselves. And the enemy was in us. The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days as I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul. There are times since, I've felt like the child born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life.
