Veterans group, animal shelter, got it. - You know, Lilly called Veronica to check up on me? - That was thoughtful. - I was extremely impressed with their professionalism and their response time. - We should do something.

Thanks to you and Nick, the medical center is getting an extremely generous donation. - That s wonderful! - That s fantastic news. - I invited our patron in today to get a tour of the facility. May I present Jeff Alexander of the Rex Alexander Foundation. We are extremely grateful for your generosity. - Well, thank you, Dr. Richwood, for having me come down today. Um, we just wanted to show our appreciation for the wonderful care of my father, Rex. - We appreciate it. In fact, we wish we could adequately show our gratitude. - Well, I ve never gone for a ride in an ambulance before. It s a childhood thing, just, it s silly. I, you know... - Well, why don t you go for a ride along with Nick and Lilly this week? - Oh. I... [sighs] I couldn t. - No, I think we could make that happen. Right? - Okay. Fine. - Fantastic. - Fantastic. - I don t think this is a good idea. - We re not breaking any rules or laws with a ride along. - In life or death situations, having a person like Jeff around... - Like Jeff? - He s not trained. He s not certified. If we re transporting a patient, he could get in the way. - Lilly, let me just remind you that the Alexanders are extremely generous patrons in our community. If Jeff wants to go for a ride along, I don t see the problem in indulging him. - Yes, ma am. - And don t worry, Lilly, it s only for a few days. - So we took the G3 to London... - Uh-huh. - For this big charity event.

She says she can t wear the Christian Louboutins because she s not religious. - [laughing] - And now this guy is invading my work life. - Are you kidding me? - Dr. Richwood was so impressed with his donation that she would let him move into the medical center if he wanted. - [laughs] And this is the guy who sent you the flowers and expensive chocolates? - This is the guy who threw a public tantrum because he had to follow the same rules as everyone else. You know, nothing annoys me more than someone who just pays their way through life. [sighs] What are you doing? - Moisturizing. Your hands are a dead giveaway of your age because the skin is thin and wrinkles easily. Come on, now let me see this guy. - Okay. Don t touch my computer. - Why would I touch your computer? Your guy s Jeff Alexander of the Rex Alexander Foundation? - You know him? And he s not my guy. - They re huge contributors to the arts programs at school. - Hm. - I don t know, maybe you should give him a chance. - What, no? I have worked so hard to get where I am and for everything I have. I have zero respect for someone who was given everything on a silver platter and therefore has no integrity and just expects us all to cater to his whims. - That s some speech. - Do you remember when I was short-listed for Barnsley Medical College? - Mm, yeah. That was your dream school. You were number one on the wait list. - Mm-hmm. You know why I didn t get in? Carlton Strand. His parents made a huge donation to the school. - That s so wrong. - Yeah. Carlton was 22 on the wait list. I was number one. Guess who got in. It wasn t me. - Well, I wouldn t mind the lifestyle. - I buy day-old bread and shop the sale racks, and I have enough student debt that I won t pay it off for a decade. - Mm. - Jeff Alexander and I have nothing in common. - You can always moisturize. - Yeah, give me some. - So I m explaining to the triage nurse, and she asks me if the patient had explained to me what happened, right? I said, "No, she was just a little tongue-tied." - [groans] - Oh. - He always tells this story. You need new material. - Ah. - I didn t know you could cook eggs in a microwave. - You can cook anything in a microwave. - Mm. - And then there s the chainsaw guy. This is a true story. - Nick! That is not a breakfast story. - Lilly s right. I ll tell you at lunch. [beeping] 1138. Code 3. - Oh, whoa... - Let s go. - What s a code 3? - Means we have to hurry. Are you coming? - Yeah. Yeah. - Driving. - I m driving this time. - Darn it. Take the jump seat in the back. - Let s go. [knocking] - Where s your mom? - In the kitchen. - You did well calling us. - Hey there.

Get the D-5. - On it. - Hey. Want to play catch? Yeah? - Tape. - Oh. - Easy does it. - Oh. Oh, I started feeling faint, and it all happened so fast. - You were lucky you were wearing your medical bracelet. - How did... how did you, uh... - Your son called 911. - Where is he? - You know, Lilly and Nick helped my dad when he was hurt. - Is your dad sick like my mom? - No. Uh, he s okay. But when I was your age? My mom got really sick. - Were you always worried about your mom? Were you always really scared? - Yeah. I was always worried about her. It s tough when you re worried about the people you love, huh? - Yeah. - Go long, all right? That s it. Ready? Here we go. Oh, what a catch! Yes! Come here. Yeah! Yes. Hey, come here. Hey. - We need to go. Now, Carter, your mom is going to be okay. But we re gonna take her to a hospital where a doctor can take a look at her, all right? Do you want to ride in the ambulance? - Oh. I bet you if you ask real nice, Lilly might let you turn on the sirens. - Can I? - Mm-hmm. I ll even let you turn on the lights. - [gasps] - Cool! - Hey, Finn. - Meggers, hi! - Is Vince in? - Yup. - Thank you. Knock knock. - Megan? Uh, hey. What are you doing here? - Half day for teacher conferences. - Oh. [sighs] - I thought I d surprise you and we could get lunch. - Um, sorry, babe, I... I can t. Actually, I m supposed to be at lunch right now. I m gonna be working late all week. - Yeah. Sure. Fine. - You re the best, babe. I ll see you later. [kisses] - I owe you an apology. I understand now why you were so upset about me parking in the emergency zone. Every second does matter. I m sorry. - Thank you for your apology. - Didn t have to tow my car, but... [laughs] Okay. Maybe you did. What do you say we start over? Clean slate? - Clean slate. - You know, I feel for Carter. Been there. - Your mom? I m sorry. - Kids shouldn t have to deal with adult issues. - I agree. - Hey. We agree on something. - Apparently. - How do you feel about sushi? - Sure, why not? - [laughs] Hey you. - Nice car. - Thank you. - It suits you. - You like? - Mm-hmm. - [laughs] You ready? - Yeah, come on. - All right, let s go. - You sure about this place? - Okay. I know it doesn t look like much from the outside, but don t judge until you see the inside, okay? - All right. - All right. [giggles] I got you, I promise. - I got it. - Ah, thank you. Let me get the light. So? What do you think? - Wow. - [laughs] Well, I d like to place some tables over there. I d like to place the dance floor here. And there s a space over there for a DJ. - Well, you were right. This place is perfect. - I could get you a 15% discount if we book today. - Keely? You rock. - [laughs] - I knew you d find something great. - It s what I do. Well, all that s left for us to do then is, uh, oh, meet with the caterers. And we need to book a DJ. Oh, and I m gonna need your final invite list. - This is gonna be the best birthday ever. - Yeah, man. - You did it. - Thanks, Vince. - Thank you. - Let s go eat, my friend. - [grunting] I can t believe I let you talk me into this. - My money s on Veronica. - I need a break. - Water. - Here you go. - You got a good workout. - How s the ride along going? - Fantastic. - And the girl? - We re going on a date tomorrow night. What? What... what s that look for? - Jeff, you know I love you. But if you re doing this because you want the challenge, or because your ego can t handle the rejection... - What? No. I... I mean, maybe at first it was a bit about that, but... - Just make sure you re doing it for the right reasons. - Okay. All right. - Let s get juice. - Why did you agree to go to dinner? - He caught me off guard. I said yes before I had a chance to really think it through properly. - You look like you re going to a business meeting. - You know what? I m just going to text him and I m going to cancel and I ll say that I m unwell. - You should go, but not in that outfit. He probably already made reservations and it would be rude to cancel now. - I hate it when you re right. - It s just dinner. It s not like you re marrying the guy. - Is there something else going on? - Vince has been acting strange lately. He s working all the time, but when I called his office, he was out for the day. Well, has he ever mentioned someone named Keely? - No. Do you want me to cancel dinner? I can stay and talk. - No, no. You re going on this date. Wear your blue dress. It s gorgeous. - Oh. - Wow. [soft laugh] You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Jeff Alexander. So good to see you again. - Thank you. [clears throat] Allow me. - Thank you. - I m Harper. Anything else you need, Jeff, just let me know. - Thank you, Harper. - Wow. - Looks amazing, doesn t it? - Looks expensive. - You know, it s my treat. Anything you like. - Thanks. - [clears throat] - Right. - Well, you have to try... - One, he used to talk, now he clams up. Two, he disappears for hours to do a simple task. Three, he starts working overtime. Four, he lies or evades your questions. Five, he buys you guilt gifts. - Hey, babe. - Hey. - I m just wrapping up here at work right now. This Tokyo account is running me ragged. You want to grab a bite? - I already ate, but you can come by my place. - Okay. All right, great. I ll see you soon. - Alcott Elementary. - Uh-huh. - First grade. Matt Smyth fell out of a tree and broke his arm and he wouldn t stop crying. And there wasn t anything I could do to help him. - Oh, no. Poor kid. - Well, I wanted to be a doctor ever since. And I ve applied to some med schools. LA Medical School is my first choice. - My fingers are crossed for you. - So do you enjoy working as a philanthropist? - Sure. My philosophy is, life is short so enjoy it. My job is to help people enjoy their lives too. - I ve never heard anyone describe philanthropy quite like that. - Well, a lot of people obsess over the money. Money doesn t matter. - Only someone with money would say that money doesn t matter. - Okay. Fair enough. It may make life easier, but money by itself never made anyone happy. Doing what you do, how do you not become emotionally attached to every patient you treat? - Well, if I did, I couldn t do my job. But for every paramedic, there s one or two cases that stick with you. Where you wonder what if the call had come in a minute earlier or there d been a little less traffic. - It s much easier to write a check. I never get to see the faces of the people we help. This whole ride-along thing s really, uh, it s really opened my eyes. - I m glad. - I can t stop thinking about Carter though. You know, I know what it s like to have a sick parent. - Well, his mom s back home and doing much better. - That s good. But I want to do something for kids like Carter. An organization, a foundation, something. - That would be wonderful. - You think so? - Absolutely. - So last piece. I ll, uh, chopstick-battle you for it. - Okay. - Ready? [clears throat] - Three, two... - One, go. [laughs] Oh, oh. - Ah! - Careful... ah. - Ah! Ha! - Organic, non-GMO air-popped popcorn seasoned with herbs. - Oh, Veronica. You re a gem. Oh. Tonight s your night to choose. - Oh. What do you think about Lilly and Jeff? - I think she ll be good for him. - I hope so. But it s only the first date. - Well, sometimes when you know, you know. - Hey, babe. These are for you. - Number five. - Pardon? - They re lovely. Thank you. What s the occasion? - Does a guy need a reason to buy his girlfriend flowers? - You tell me. - [sighs] Look, I feel guilty. I ve just been working such long hours. - Called your office yesterday. - Oh, yeah? - I thought you said you d be in meetings all day, but your assistant said you were gone for the afternoon. - Oh, you know, I had a couple, uh, meetings off-site. - Mm. That s unusual for you. - Tokyo guys wanted to see the town, so I took them on a tour. Uh, you want your coffee? - So who s working on the Tokyo account? - Ben, Aaron, Jackie, Brad. Is everything okay? - Why wouldn t it be? - [scoffs] I don t know. - [sighs] I m fine. We re fine, right? - Yes. Of course we are. Come here. [kisses] - Thank you. That was the most amazing meal I ve ever had. - Oh, that was the most amazing chopstick battle I ve ever had. I had a lot of fun. - So did I. - Jeffrey. - Crystal. - [kisses] - Uh, okay. Um, Crystal, this is Lilly. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Lilly s been kind enough to put up with me at the medical center this week. - Oh. You re one of his charity projects. How lovely. Both: Actually... - Jeffrey, we missed your gorgeous face at the polo match for muscular dystrophy. - I had a previous obligation. How d it go? - We raised 500. I was hoping for 700. Promise me that you won t miss my gala? - Uh, remind me? - We re raising money for CDH. Where s your phone? - Crystal... hey. I m so sorry. Crystal, my phone, please? Crystal, this is not okay. - There. Now you can t forget. - What are you doing? - Wow. What is that outfit? - I m trying out a new look. I m pretty sure Vince is cheating on me. - Vince? I don t believe it, no. - I know him well enough to know when he s lying. And he was lying about where he was and who he was with. - Okay, that doesn t mean he s cheating though. You don t know that. - I m pretty sure her name is Keely, and she s probably 22 and does hot yoga and drinks kale smoothies. - Have you talked to Vince about this yet? - No, I m not ready for that. What about you? How was your date? - It was fine, but Jeff lives in this complete other world. And I don t want to be a part of it. I want to just focus on getting into med school and that s it. - You know, I can always give you a list of what else we d like, you know, if you re gonna provide. - And what is going on here? - Perfect. Thank you. Oh, well, Jeff has catered breakfast for us. - Ah. - Mm-hmm. - That s awfully kind of him. - I couldn t take another day of Nick s microwaved eggs. - Oh. - Gourmet as they were. - I m gonna bring my famous cold spaghetti pie. That ought to get us a steak dinner, you ll see. - Dr. Richwood to the ER. - Uh, Nick, come with me. Will you take that? - Uh, what are the sirens for? - Multiple car crash coming in. - Yikes. - Lot of people texting and driving these days, and not just kids. - Yeah. Hey, listen, I... I had a really great time the other night. I was hoping that maybe we could, uh, tr... - Uh, welfare call.

Hello! - Hello? - Is anyone home? - LA County Sheriff! - Ma am? - Hello, is anyone here? - Ma am? LA County Sheriff! - Hello? - Is anyone here? - Ma am, are you home? - Ma am, we re here to help you. - Hello? Is anyone home? Is anyone here? LA County Sheriff. - Lilly. - Did you find her? - No, but I found this. [laughs] - This is Charlie 8-12. 70s female has gone on vacation in the Rockies. I repeat: 70s female is on vacation in the Rockies. She ll be returning March 25th. Over. - So this woman is safe and happily traveling through Canada. - Apparently. - Ha, great. - We re all good. - So, uh, you get many false alarms? - A few. I d rather have a false alarm than a fatality. - Mm. - Good morning. Hey, good morning. - Hi. - I am here to see Vince Rossmore. I m his 11:00. - Uh, give me one second. - Okay. - Yep. He s ready for you. - Perfect. Thank you. - Your 11:00 a.m. is here. - Hi. - Come on in. Have a seat. - Thank you. - Thank you for coming. - Well, if the client is too busy to come to the caterer, the caterer comes to the client. - Yes. - Voilà. - Megan loves chocolate. - I have all the chocolate choices for her. [laughs] Let me see. Let s start with, uh, we have a Belgian milk chocolate. A fudgy chocolate with ganache, my personal fave, yes. And a raspberry-filled dark chocolate. And, lastly, a coconut chocolate with cream cheese. - I m glad I skipped lunch. - Yeah. [laughs] - Did you bring the milk? - Did I bring the milk? - Yes. - What s in my bag of tricks over here? Milk. [clears throat] - Okay. I m not even gonna go there. - It was on sale! - Yeah. Knowing you... - Bang for my buck. Let me get you a fork. Hold on, let me see. Okay. Here we go. - Thank you. All right, let s see. Okay. - [laughs] - That s the one. - [laughing] - That s the one, right there. - All my clients die for Becky s Bakery. - Hey, Finn. - Hey, Meggers. He s in a meeting right now. You can t go in. Sorry, doll. - Mmm. - [laughs] - Yes! - Yeah. - What s going on in there? - Just a meeting. - Just melts in your mouth. - Yes. - Yeah. [laughs] - With whom is he meeting? - She s not a work client. Her name is Kelly, Kylie... - Keely? - That s it. - Mmm. That s it. That s the best. That is the best right there. - [laughing] - Oh, yes! - Yeah? [both laughing] - Don t tell him I was here. - [grunting] - Nice form, Pops. What do you call that move? - Uh, lunge curl. - [chuckles] - What do you got there? - Oh, it s Veronica s vanilla milkshake. You want some? - Ugh, keep that away from me. [grunts] How s everything at the medical center? - Intense. I don t know how they do what they do every day. - It s a special calling. - Yeah. - How s Lilly? - You know, I just can t figure her out. She s impossible to read. - Son, I m gonna tell you the secret to understanding women. Listen. - Ow. Okay. I m listening. What is it? - No, no, no, no, no. That s the secret. A woman will tell you everything you need to know if you just listen. - Ha. - Morning, Doc. - 380, copy. - Copy. [indistinct radio chatter] - I can t believe you re still awake. - Well, we introduced solid foods this week and Everett started sleeping through the night. Which happily means Mommy and Daddy started sleeping through the night. - En passant. - What was that? - Look it up. - Nick hates to lose. - I do not. En passant? - Mm-hmm. - It s ridiculous. - I got an email from the Los Angeles Medical School. "Dear Lilly Springler... Inform..." Wait-listed. Again. - Means you still have a chance. - Yeah, if a buy a new wing for the hospital. I... I can t keep doing this. - Doing what? - Getting so close to my dream and then having the door slammed in my face. [beeping] - Charlie 812, pediatric trauma. 1915 North Tamara Avenue. Support. LAFD on scene. - Asthma is difficult to deal with, but your brother s gonna be okay. - Lilly wouldn t tell you that if it wasn t true. - That s right. - I ll go with them. - I will stay here, and I will take care of the paperwork. - I hate paperwork. She s the best. - Yeah, so I m learning. - Got a knack with kids. - Well, that s because I am one. - [chuckles] I can see that. - When was the last time you were on vacation? - Um. I can t remember. - Or had fun? - Does the cardiac science symposium count? - No, definitely not. - [chuckles] - Saw you re off Saturday. Any plans? - Laundry. Errands. Loads of fun. - Good; get your errands done early, cause I m picking you up at noon. - What for? - You ll see. Trust me. [knocking] - What do you think? - Ixnay on the sneakers. - Jeff won t tell me where we re going. I want to be comfortable. [phone rings] Is that Vince? You know you re gonna have to talk to him eventually. - I know. I just can t right now. - Are you gonna be all right? - I m sorry to be such a bummer, but this is not the way my life was supposed to go. By 30, I was supposed to be a professor, not a single substitute teacher living with a roommate. No offense. - Peoples lives don t turn out the way they planned. But you have family and friends who love you. And you have plenty of time to achieve all of your dreams... with or without Vince. - [sniffs] Thanks, Lil. - Okay. I can t leave you here. - [giggles] - Come with us. Come. - No. No, I m just gonna lie here and contemplate my wasted existence. - [sighs] - I ll be fine. Just go. I m gonna be mad if you don t go and have fun. - Okay. - Wow. You look beautiful, as always. - Thanks. - Promise not to have me towed? - If you park in the right spot, I won t have to. - Hm. You know, you were my inspiration for this whole thing. - What thing? Jeff, what is it? - Watching you at work, you inspired me to want to be more involved with the people we help. So you are standing on the new Rex Alexander Kid Camp. - Oh, that s wonderful! - I mean, when my mom got sick, I had a hard time dealing with the sadness. My dad sent me to Camp Calston for the week. At first I didn t want to go, but then I ended up having the time of my life. We swam in the lake. We camped out under the stars. Played games. My counselor helped me understand that it was okay to feel sad about my mom and still have fun with the other kids, that I wasn t alone. - You were just a boy when you went through all this. - [sighs] I want this place to be for kids what Camp Calston was for me. You know, a place for them to process their grief and do what kids should be doing, having fun. - Well, I m really proud of you. And it does fit your personal philosophy, helping people enjoy their lives. - You remembered. I want you to be a part of it. - I want to be a part of it too. - Well, everyone has to bring something to the table. - [chuckles] - What do you got? - I can teach first aid. - Mm. - Knowledge empowers kids. It reduces their stress to have an action plan in case of an emergency. - Amazing. Anything else? - I can make a mean s more. - Oh, now we are talking. You are hired. - [laughs] [phone ringing] [phone rings] - Megan, I don t know what s going on, but it would be great if you would just call me back. I love you. - Thank you. Hey. Sorry I m a few minutes late. - Fine. Have a seat. - You okay? - My girlfriend, Megan, is having a tough time with this birthday. - Well, 30 is different for everyone, Vince. - I don t know why. It was fine for me. It s just another number. - [laughs] Look. Hey. Maybe it s not about the number, but what it means to her as a woman. - What do you mean? - Okay, well, some people have certain expectations for themselves, personally and professionally, right? - Of course. - Well, if those things haven t been reached by a certain age, it triggers a crises. - Look at you. - Do you like that? - [laughs] - Dropping gems. [laughs] - Yeah, I guess I never thought about it that way. - Yeah. I majored in psychology. Don t ask how that led to a career in party planning. - [laughs] - [laughs] Something went wrong. - I think throwing her this birthday party will probably be the best thing to do to cheer her up. - Okay. Let s go over the final details. - All right. Let s do it. - So we got the place you wanted. - All right. - And if we don t hit any snags, I think we ll be up and running by early next year. But enough about all that. I ve got something for you. [chuckles] - Jeff, what s this? - You ll see. Close your eyes. No peeking. [laughs] Ready? - Jeff! - I made these myself. [both chuckle] Veronica was a little concerned about you eating my cooking though. - Well, I ll go with PB&J just to be safe. - Mm. - Mmm! They re delicious. - Ah, success. I could tell this medical school thing was stressing you out so I wanted to take you somewhere where you d relax. - That s really thoughtful. - I propose a toast. A toast to enjoying life. [glasses clink] You know, it s true what they say. The best things in life, you can t buy. - I think I owe you an apology. - Oh? - I m trained to quickly assess a situation and make an accurate snap judgment. Lives depend on it. But I may have judged you too soon. - How so? - Well, I just thought you were some rich, entitled, spoiled, shallow brat who just bought his way through life. - Any more adjectives? - [laughs] No, I m serious. I thought you were just coasting, without... Without care or regard for anyone else. - Please, don t sugarcoat on my account. - [scoffs] Now that I ve spent some time with you, I can admit that I was wrong. - Well, maybe not entirely. Before I met you, I was coasting, in a way. You made me really look at myself. What I wanted to do, who I wanted to be. And it turns out it s helping kids. - Uh, thank you for today. - Uh, my pleasure. - Well, I ll see you at the med center tomorrow then. - I meant to tell you. Rex has meetings all next week in London. And I m traveling with him. - London? Nice. - You know, foundation business. - Well, enjoy. - I, uh, I don t know if you remember what Crystal said about the CDH gala. - I remember. - I was, uh... wondering if you d be interested in going. - Are you sure Crystal wouldn t mind? - I don t mind if she does mind. What do you think? - I d like that. - Me too. [kisses] Good night. - Good night. - How did it go? - Uh, good. And what about you, are you feeling a little better? - A little. But you re right. I still have plenty of time to achieve my goals. And I m not getting any closer to my dreams by moping around or by putting on wrinkle cream. - That s the spirit. And what are you working on? - Grad school applications. - Megan, that s wonderful. - Thank you for being such a good friend. And for putting up with my craziness. - I wouldn t trade your craziness for anything. - [laughs] [upbeat rock music] ♪ ♪ - So, Jeff, tell me about this new charity of yours. - It s a camp for kids dealing with chronic illnesses within their families. They do typical camp things with the added benefit of having peers they can relate to. Like, uh, one I wish I had when I was a kid. - I love it. I m proud of you, son. Founding your first charity. Your mom would be proud too. - Thanks, Dad. - When that ambulance came for me, I remembered how short life is. And how important it is to let the people you love know how much you care about them.

You should come to the show. - I don t know. I think we have some... Don t we have some business we have to account for... - Oh, our last meeting s at 4:00. - Then it s settled. - All right. [camera shutter clicks] - [chuckles] - Oh. - We were you guys headed? Oh. - Oh. - Oh, boy. - They re everywhere. - From now on, wear a helmet, dude. Okay? - How many times do we have to tell these kids that it s more cool to wear a helmet than to end up in here? - They still don t listen. - Yeah. - Everett s never leaving the house without a helmet. And a full-armored body suit. Where s our philanthropist today? - London. - You can say it s none of my business, but you re like my sister and I don t want to see you... - Okay. What is it? - Be careful. - Thought you liked Jeff? - I do, but he lives in an entirely different world. And I don t want to see you get hurt. - Jeff is far more down-to-earth than he seems. - Hope you re right. - Look, I appreciate your concern, but I know what I m doing. - Okay. But if he hurts you? He s gonna go for an ambulance ride and not in the jump seat. - Okay, deal. - Megan, this silent treatment is getting ridiculous. Would you please call me back? I need to talk to you. It s important.

Megan won t return my calls, and I don t know why. - She did seem quite distressed last time I saw her. - When was that? - You were locked in this office with that, uh, Kelly, Kylie... - Keely? - That s the one. She thinks you re cheating, dude. - She thinks... Finn, I would never. - I know, I know. - Thanks. - Anytime, man. Hey, can I wrangle an invite to that birthday shindig of yours? Guess not. - We re home! - Welcome back, boys! How was your trip? - Boring. - [laughs] - Would have much rather been here with you.

I can t wait to see Lilly again. - You must really miss her. You should do something for her. Something that only you could do for her.

And it s taken me all these years to realize you are my family. And I want to make it official. Veronica... I want you to know how deeply I cherish you. Will you marry me? - Oh, Rex, I don t...

A congratulations gift? - Well, I haven t even told him yet. I was going to tell him at the gala today. - Oh, that s right, that s today. What is the future doctor wearing? - I m wearing my black dress from graduation. - No. Absolutely not. - Well, I like that dress. Why not? - So many reasons, I can t even begin. - But... - Get your keys. We re going shopping. - But it s cute. So what is this place? - It s a high-end thrift shop. They have amazing designer dresses at affordable prices. - Well, what about that bridesmaid s dress I wore to CC s wedding? - You might as well wear scrubs. No, you re not wearing scrubs. - All right, all right. - Come on, I m gonna make sure you look like a million bucks. You look beautiful. But those shoes? No, no, and no. - What s wrong with my shoes? - What isn t wrong with those shoes? - They re comfortable. - Mm-mm.

That s what friends are for. - Hey, that looks like Jeff. - Yep. - What? What? Is that Crystal? And what s this other article? "Alexander s Million Dollar Donation to the LA Medical School." They made that donation yesterday. - I guess you know who to thank for getting you off the wait list. - That s why he gave me the gift basket. He already knew I d gotten in. No. I refuse to let anyone buy me into medical school, especially not Jeff Alexander. It would make me a hypocrite! I don t want to be another Carlton Strand, taking a place from someone who actually deserves it. - I don t know anyone who deserves to be a doctor more than you do. Are you still going to the gala? - Yeah. I m going to confront Jeff, find out what s really going on. He can t lie to my face, right? Thanks. - Have fun. Oh, you girls look good. Good to see you. Have a great time. Name? - Uh, Lilly Springler. - Sorry, you re not on the list. - I m a guest of Jeff Alexander. - Oh! There you are. They mistakenly listed you as "Spinster." Go ahead, enjoy the gala. - Thanks. - It was Calandre s first day out, and she crashed the super yacht in Capri! And then she jumped off and tried to swim... - Lilly. - Jeffrey? - Hi. - Wow. You look stunning. Tonight, again. - I need to talk to you. - Jeffrey? I hadn t finished my story. - Um, Crystal, you remember Lilly? - Hello. That s a lovely dress. Where did you get it? - Oh. I, um... - I had one just like it. But I gave mine to charity. Mine had a little... Ah. It is my old dress! [laughing] - What s so funny? - Nothing. - It s the funniest coincidence. Lilly here chose my dress that I gave to a consignment shop to wear to my gala. [laughing] - Crystal. - You won t believe this. She s wearing my old dress. - Excuse me. [laughter] - That s embarrassing. - I know. - Lilly, wait. Lilly, would you stop? Good afternoon. - Ah. - What was that all about? - Guess my first impression of you was right after all. - Is that so? - Yes. I know about the donation bribe. - What donation? Lilly, I make a lot of donations. You re gonna have to be more specific. - Look, I don t need your bribes or your charity or your pity! - Pity? What are you talking about? This... - Someone help! Call an ambulance! Help! - Call 911! - Out of the way. Move. Step back. Everyone, get back. She s a paramedic. Give her some room. Back! Come on, back.

You okay? - Let s go get a drink. - I believe these belong to you. - Oh, they re not even mine. - Lilly... - Jeff, I... Our worlds are just too far apart. - If that s how you really feel. Guess there s nothing left to say. - [cries] - Everything okay, son? - You haven t had a thing to eat all day. What s wrong? - It s Lilly. She says our worlds are too far apart. Can t fix that. - I remember when I first came to work for you. I was so overwhelmed the first day, I nearly quit. - I didn t know that. - But you didn t. - Yeah, why is that? - Because I saw a heartbroken boy. And I thought I could add something to your lives that had nothing to do with money or fancy cars. If Lilly is the right one for you, she ll find a way to close the distance. - Mm, D-Day. 30. [sighs] Mm. Huh. Interesting. [soft laugh] - [laughs] Everett is a comic genius. You should see the faces that he s making. He s got one that s like... - Funny. - [laughs] It s just... Yeah.

Think she blocked my number. Do you know that Finn thinks that Megan thinks that I m cheating on her? - Excuse me. - Okay. Now, I am not at liberty to speak on Megan s behalf... - Because that s absurd, all right? I have never and would never cheat on Megan. I... [breathing deeply] - Okay. Okay, come on, sit down. Come on. - Now I feel dizzy. - So you re not cheating? - No, are you... Look, I have been planning a big surprise party for Megan s birthday tonight. - Oh. - Yeah. Okay, look, all right, I understand how my behavior might have seemed suspicious, but I was just trying to keep the party a secret. - Okay, that makes sense. But let me ask you something. Were you going to invite me to this party? - Well, I couldn t exactly mail you an invitation. I was gonna tell you at the last minute so you wouldn t have to keep the party a secret. But look, it doesn t even matter. There s not going to be a party once I tell her. - Leave it to me. - [sighs] All right. - What on earth are you doing? - I m studying for my CSET. I m gonna ace this thing and get into UCLA s education program. - You re studying on your birthday? You re even sadder than I am. - Also, good news. According to this, 40 is the new 30. So I don t have to worry about turning 30 for another ten years. - Well, that is good news. Now go and get ready. - Why? - It s your birthday. I m taking you out to dinner to celebrate. - You don t have to do that, especially after everything that happened at the gala with Jeff. - Look, tonight is not about me. It s about you. And I won t take no for an answer. - Okay, boss. - All right. - Going. - Okay. Go get dressed. - Look at us, two single girls hitting the town. Is this it?
