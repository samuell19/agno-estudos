Time and space have been twisted too much, it looks like-- They've switched places AND gone back in time a week! My mistake, my mistake. Well, does it really matter? Yes! It wasn't overdoing it.

It's all over your face, [literally, ho no ji] You can't show that to our boss. But we couldn't collect the debt today, so that means our boss is gonna get angry, or maybe fire our asses! Or they could beat the shit out of us. I don't think so... ...probably. It's really tough being poor. It sure is. I used to be poor, so I know. Oh, really? We didn't have anything to eat.

Well, the master will be home late tonight. The master and mistress will be getting divorced in three days... Eh? What did you say? Oh yeah, that's right. Just three more days. But why are papa and mama getting divorced? Well, your father works so hard, he hardly ever comes home. And your mother can't live with a husband like that. If only the master had noticed that earlier... Then probably the mistress would not want a divorce. Now, please return to your studies and practice! Get back to work! Okay! Lately, my fortune telling has been off. I guess I'm in a slump. Mister, give me another. Isn't that Nakazawa Yuuko? Hey, hey, you know this song? It's by Nakazawa Yuuko. She used to be in Morning Musume. Do you know? More or less. You know? How about you? I LOVE IT! I see, you love it! This is great, you both know it! Well you see, my daughter.. ...is a big fan of Morning Musume. And, thanks to her, I know a lot about them. And, thanks to her, I know a lot about them. Who? Who's your favorite member? I'm embarrassed to say it, but I like Yoshizawa Hitomi-chan. She's energetic and looks like my daughter. How about you? The cute one, what's her name...she looks just like my daughter: Rika Ishikawa! I see what you mean. Daughters are cute, aren't they? They are cute. CUTE! They are cute. CUTE! How should I say it... THEY'RE THE APPLE OF MY EYE! I suppose they are the apple of my eye. Despite that... They get in the way of the father's life. They ignore us. And they rebel against us. And just last night, my daughter brought home a guy with a blond Mohawk and a nose ring! That's quite unfortunate. YESSIR! Yeah. She said that guy is her boyfriend! So...so, so...listen listen. To keep this from happening again, from now on, we're going to have regular talks. Have regular talks. And get her attention. You've figured it out! You gotta get her attention! That's how to get her back. You can't let that happen! Right! So fathers, let's unite! Okay! No one can get between us and our daughters! No one! We're not mannequins! We're not mannequins! We're the only ones who can save our daughters! Yeah! Which one of you talked just now?

That's right. Well There's no way I would tell you! What? What kind of attitude is that towards your father? I'm sorry. I think you understand. It has to be someone who suits our family. Eh? You don't have to worry about it. I will find an appropriate person baby for a promising future for you. Eh? What are you saying? You just keep studying and practicing, baby. Become a lady who can deal with any situation. Wait a second! I've already decided. I told you to wait! Do you think I'd be happy with someone you chose for me to marry? It's stupid to marry someone you don't love. You can't live with only your dreams. If you don't think about your future when you choose someone, you'll have a hard time for the rest of your life. So what? Just because we're not rich...it's okay to have hard times! Status and prestige aren't important. Love is! Hey! Why aren't you listening to me? Mama left you because you're like this. That's a problem between papa and mama. You should just be quiet. Don't treat me like a child, you blockhead! What is that manner of speech? When did you become such a vulgar child, baby? You're not from a POOR family. A poor family? Quit looking down on people, you blockhead! What? You fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Fool. Blockhead! Oh no, it's turned into a big fight! Just leave them be. Otherwise, they'll get mad at us, too. What are you saying? We have to calm them down! A song, a song! Woof woof! Ready, and... Ah, mother, father Woof woof! Ah. I'm so grateful Woof! Ah, your selfish daughter Woof woof! I'll always be your daughter Shut up! Blockhead! Fool. Don't choose something with "mother and father" in it. There's no mother in this house. It's got to be a peaceful song. Ah, there's that one. Ready, and... The person I love Woof woof! Was kind to me Woof woof! Happy things have increased Woof! I told you to shut up! Get out of here! Fool. Blockhead! They got angry at us again. Of course! There are no "happy things!" You should get a clue, too! We'll get it this time. Let's think about it. Ready, and... SHUT UP! I told you to be quiet! Charmy, sit down. I'm already sitting. Oh oh oh oh oh OH! Charmy! HA! How many times I gotta tell you, that's not a place to sit! Oh, I'm sorry. Well, then...umm...ah, Charmy, is there someone? Hm? I'm right here. [she misunderstood a double-meaning] Oh oh oh oh OH! Not that...is there something, for example, that squeezes your heart and makes it pound until it hurts? Yes. If you can feel pain, you're healthy. That's good. That's for the best! Oh oh oh oh OH! Is there a guy you like? What is this, all of a sudden? It's nothin' to be embarrassed about. Despite my appearance, I happen to be an expert on love. OH! Ask me anything. I can't! OH! You're getting embarrassed again. HA! Even if you don't ask, I can tell HA! just from looking at your face. It's on my face? I knew it! Listen to me, Charmy! If you just wait, no one will ever come. If you love someone, you've gotta approach them, BANG! Even in fiiiiiire or water! Approach? Basically, you act sexy towards a guy and he's yours [ichi When I was young, girls had me falling for them [koro koro] left and right. My nickname was "Koro-chan"! Koro-chan? Yup! Don't tell mom. If you don't dress sexier, and show 'em a little somethin-somethin'... How disgusting! There's no disgusting or elegant! So, Charmy, how far have you gone with your boyfriend? That's enough! You idiot. Dad? I farted. You're the worst! I can't stand this lifestyle! I wonder if it's clear skies in the pastures today. It's warm here. It's so warm, we can walk around in clothes like these. It's warm! It feels good. Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's some cute babes! You said it! Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's some cute babes! You said it! "Eek?" They're really cute. Yup. Eh? Ain't they Country Musume? For real? I don't trust those chicks. Don't trust 'em. The boss got real mad at us. Course he would. Why? 'Cause we didn't collect the money! It's easy to understand Today, we gotta get the money! Why? Else the boss'll get mad again! Boss, you're smart! I told you. Let's go! Today, we're gonna act like on/ (demons)! I got it! Let's go! What're you doin'? I said, let's go! What're you doin'?

Today, you're gonna pay us our damn money! Pay up! Be quiet! Now's riot the time for that. Go away! Okay. We'll come again Please forgive the intrusion. If it came down to money or boobs, I'd choose... BOOBS BOOBS! Quit messing around That's why you're a bad father! BOOBS! Be quiet! BOOBS! Be quiet! BOOBS! Stop it! AAAAH! BOOBS! AAAAH! BOOBS! That was scary! Sure was. What do we do? If we go back like this, the boss'll get mad again. If we go back to the house, she'll get mad at us. Which one's worse? They're both bad. Let's do this. First, call our boss... Great, boss! You're smart! Of course! My face is cut too. I'll call! 090-YA KU ZA-0 YA BU N. [oyabun is a yakuza boss] Ah, boss? We went to collect the money. Umm...the person there threatened us and we ran away with our tails between our legs! Boss, the Oyabun was really pissed! Course he was! If we go back like this, he'll be even more pissed! There it is again. I don't like it when people are mad at me. Same here. I don't like it when people are mad at me. I remember when someone got mad at me. What happened? I was walking in my hometown, when someone came up to me. Someone came up to you? I was walking in my hometown, when someone came up to me. Yeah, I was just minding my own business, and someone I didn't even know came up to me. No idea who, eh? Named Tanaka. So you know who it was. Someone named Tanaka. Tanaka-ish. What's Tanaka-ish? Tanaka-chic. What does Tanaka-chic mean? Here's Tanaka and here's Suzuki. This person was over here. This is hard to understand. What are you sayin'? That guy came up to me. Came up to you... And he had a short moustache. Recently? Short moustaches are popular now. And this guy said, "Excuse me, aren't you Chinpira B from the movie Tokkaekko?' He knows you. Yes, that's right. Then he said, "Please do your best!" I see. I said, "Thank you very much." That's all right to thank someone for that. Then we started hitting each other. Why? You were just talking! I guess those are irreconcilable differences. You guys a married couple? I am not married to that guy. I know. I know that. I thought, "What's he gonna do? and he pulls off his moustache! It comes off? And threw it that way! So he threw it, where did it go? And threw it that way! So he threw it, where did it go? It landed on me! Why did it land on you? It landed on me! Why did it land on you? Since then, people have called me "Tanaka". People mistake you for him? Let's end there. Ohhhh I hate it, hate it, hate it! I can't stand this lifestyle! Why won't anyone understand Charmy's feelings? I want to go home now! Mama! Charmy! Mama! Mama, something terrible has happened to Charmy. All of a sudden, I became the child of a poor family. I can't stand this lifestyle! I want to go home! I see. Charmy, I know all about it. I'm watching you from far away. Mama, help me! Charmy, listen to me. Right now you're supposed to be feeling something...learning something. There are times in life when you have to overcome things. Do your best. Charmy! Mama! I wear the ring you gave me every day! I can't take it anymore. Nothing good's gonna happen, no matter how long I live in this house. I wanna go home. Mom? Yossie? Mom? Mom! I'm havin' a hard time here! I know. Is it tough? Nah. But rather than that, how're you feeling? I'm okay. You don't have to worry about me. Do you want to run away? Nah. But...I'm worried about my sisters. It's okay. They're just fine. Listen here, Yossie. Don't think about anything else now. This is your only chance to experience the things you're learning now. Do your best, Yossie! Mom! What am I supposed to learn? I just want to go home. I treasure the wristband you made for me. If I see a shooting star... What should I wish for? Even if my tears won't stop, Scold me like you used to, my mother. Maybe my tears will never stop. I'm sorry for being such a selfish girl, mother. Go. Don't go. Go. Don't go. Go. Don't go. Go. Don't go. Go. Go! Hiroshi-San... We can't go on like this. No matter how you think about it, it's impossible. If it's about the family, I'll take care of it. No. That's not it! What's wrong, then? It's no good. I can't say it. No matter what, I can't say it. Because... I can't say it. I can't! Keiko-San! What's the problem? C'mon! C'mon! Please excuse us. Excuse us. I realize you must be very busy, but may we please have a moment of your time? So much energy. Excuse me... Where's your sister? They won't settle down. RED LIGHT! She's in the bath. Well, that's good. Great, at least she's home. You girls know we're debt collectors, right? You know, right? Right? RED LIGHT! If it's money you want, we don't have any! You're late. This girl was late. We know that. We know you girls don't have any money. Thanks. You listening? You-listening? Do you have anything liquid that can turn into money? Anything? RED LIGHT! What's something liquid? Something yellow or gold. Don't you have anything expensive? Anything? RED LIGHT! We'll look around! You didn't say anything. This is making my injuries hurt. Keiko-San, wait a second Keiko-San, listen to me. What is it, Hiroshi-San? I've figured it out. What did you figure out, Hiroshi-San? I'll leave my family. As long as I have you, that's enough. Leave your family? You idiot! You don't have the right to love anyone. This is really the end. Farewell! Keiko-San Love. WHAT IS LOVE?! It's family, after all. It's family, after all. Woof. Let's clean up before Miss Yossie finishes her bath. Right. If we continue to goof off, he'll deduct it from our bonus. By the way, tomorrow is Miss Yossie's birthday. He's probably bought her something fabulous we couldn't possibly afford with our salary. How about this? That's just a pot! You use it for cooking! What are you thinking, idiot. How bout this? That's a ladle. You use that for cooking too! Something smaller and shinier! How about this? That's chopped burdock root! Yeah that's burdock! We also have this. That's a ring. That's something liquid. A RING? And it looks really expensive! Who woulda thought something so expensive would be in this house. Yeah. Let's take this. Let's. Goodbye Bye! Bye bye! We don't need this. ATTACK Let's hurry up and finish so we can watch TV. There's a tissue. What's happened to Miss Yossie lately? You said it. I wish she'd help us with the cleaning. What's this? Ewww! What's this beat-up dirty thing? A dust cloth? If so, it's too small. A blanket? If so, it's too small. This is Miss Yossie's wrist band. This is Miss Yossie's wrist band. Yes, it is. How can she wear such a dirty thing? Yes, it is. How can she wear such a dirty thing? Let's throw it away. Yes, let's. Un deux trois! Ah, my ring is gone! Did you see it? What's a ring? The small shiny thing I always have with me. You mean this? That is a pot. I do always have that with me, but the ring is smaller and shiny! This? I always have that with me too, but the ring is smaller and shines! This? This is chopped burdock root. Ah, where did it go? Perhaps it was about this big and had a shiny rock in it? Yes, that! Where is it? The debt collectors took it! They took it? Oh, no! It was that unforgettable day. The day I entered junior high school. The beautiful April cherry blossoms were blooming! Charmy! At last, you're an adult! I'm giving you this ring! I got this from your grandmother when I entered junior high school. I got this from your grandmother when I entered junior high school. This ring was with me... ..during hard times... ..fun times... ...when I met your father... ...and when you were born! It really is a ring full of memories! Yes. Charmy, you'll study, fall in love...and maybe have rough times. But keep this ring with you. And, someday, ...when you have your own child... ...and that child enters junior high school... ...you should give your child this ring. Okay, Charmy? Those debt collectors are too cruel. ...taking the precious ring I got from Mama! Too cruel! I can't take it! I hate being poor! I hate this lifestyle! I WANT TO GO HOME! What a nice bath! Eh? It's gone. If we may have a word with you... You had quite a fight with the master last night. You made the master very sad. Miss Yossie, please don't make the master sad. That's right. He's your only family. He's my only family, eh? By the way, do you know what happened to the wrist band that was around here? That dirty dust rag? Oh, THAT wristband. It was fairly dirty, so we took the liberty of disposing of it. You disposed of it?! We threw it away. You threw it away? I'll never forget that day, it was the day I entered junior high school. It was the beautiful season when the April cherry blossoms were in full bloom! It was the beautiful season when the April cherry blossoms were in full bloom! Well, at last, you're an adult! I heard wrist bands are popular now, so I made you one! Listen, Yossie. In this world, there are things that are popular and stylish and ready-made. But handmade things... They're good because they're made from the heart! When I was a child. Your grandma made me pencil boxes, bags, and even clothes when I was a child. I was so, so happy. I always treasured them. When you become a mother, make your child lots of handmade things with your heart! Okay, Yossie? That...that precious wristband...declaring it beautiful or dirty and throwing it away. I hate being rich! I want to go back to my real home! To think it was that special to her. Right! How about we tell the master tomorrow? You're right. Tomorrow's her birthday. It might be useful. Aibon-sama, I feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for them. Please do something for them if you would. Ashita asatte shinasatte! [Tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, bad pun.] Do something, you say... Next is the weather. Yasuda-San. Yasuda-San? Next is the weather in the Tokyo area. Tonight will be cloudy. In some places, the first snow of the season could fall. Tonight will be cloudy. In some places, the first snow of the season could fall. This is the end! It feels like my heart is being ripped out! I don't understand what rich people are thinking! I wanna go home! This is really the end! My heart will die if I stay here any longer! I can't live with a poor family! Please, let me go home! Here I come, PYON! Here I am, PYON! See you tomorrow, PYON! Who are you? Bang, bang! What are you saying? I'm the magic user. Aibon! I see you two are having a hard time, so I'll grant you one wish. Grant my wish? Tomorrow, at your birthday, make a wish when you blow out your candles. It'll surely come true, PYON! Bye-bye! Eh? What was that? Who was that little. Who're you calling little? I forgot to mention. If you don't blow out your candles in one breath, your wish won't come true. So, be careful, PYON! See ya! At last! At last, I can go home! Finally, I can go home! If I recall, it was one week ago! The two girls who switched places on their birthday... And experienced the other's life for one week. Tomorrow, it will be their birthday again. Will Charmy's and Yossie's wishes come true? AND! What will happen to the divorce and eviction in the fates of the two families? My moustache came off, but I don't care! Let me try and see the future. Moustache PIN moustache PIN moustache PIN PIN TAAA! I can't say it. Congratulations! Yossie, here's a present from me. The maids told me what happened, so I think you'll like it. To my beloved only daughter, Yossie. Happy birthday, baby. Lately, we've been fighting. But I'm happiest when I see your smile. You've looked very sad ever since you lost something to put on your arm. This year, I'd like to give you a bracelet. Will you happily accept it? I'm sorry for always making you sad and alone. I'm sorry for always making you sad and alone. I'm sorry for always making you sad and alone. From Papa. Papa, thank you very much. To receive such a fancy thing. But you see... ...this isn't what I wanted. Mom made that wristband with her heart for me. No matter how expensive the bracelet, it can't take the place of that wristband. That wristband was made with love that can't be purchased with all the money in the world. This family has a lot of money, but there's no love. Divorce is stupid! Jobs and money are not important. Isn't the most important thing in this world family love? I wish that our family can get along well together. Congratulations! AAAH Charmy! GYUUTAN [beef tongue] Today, your sisters AH! did their best CHANJA [spicy Korean food] and readied a present AH for you AH ZO! To our dear sister Charmy, Happy birthday! Sorry your precious item got taken away. It's not as shiny as-the one you had, but we all got together and made you one. This year, we're giving you a handmade ring. Even though we always made you mad, we're actually grateful for you. Your food became really nasty all of a sudden, but we still love you. We're going to lose our house and don't know what will happen to us. But please be the Charmy-neechan we love. From Makoto, Ai, Risa and Asami. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. This is the happiest birthday of my life. I've finally realized what is truly important. That's everyone's love, ...as a family, and as sisters. Everyone, thank you so much. A house of unsurpassable love like this mustn't be taken away! No way! I wish this family's debt would go away. Well then, I'll grant your wishes! It's not shining. That won't make magic. From cat fights to world peace, Smiley Lawyers will resolve any problem! I'm your lawyer, Mizuno. Sorry to keep you waiting. The divorce preparations are finally complete. All we have to do is sign the divorce papers, and it will be legally binding. Isn't that good news? Yes, yes, the divorce papers, eh? Success! Success! What are you doing? Woof? That paper you're eating is the divorce document! Spit it out, Success! Well, well, it's okay. Success has already eaten it. Let's call it off, I understand. Yossie opened my eyes. I hereby cancel the divorce. Papa Oh, no! Yossie, thank you. I was wrong. From now on, you, your mother and I will happily live together. It's all about love, isn't it? It's all about love! Who woulda thought that ring was worth 100,000,000 yen? The boss let us go without beating us up again. But ya think we'll be able to return 300,000,000 yen by today? That's impossible. There's nothing in this world that could save our asses now. No matter how hard we look, it don't exist. We've gotta kick those girls outta that house today. What's gonna happen to 'em tomorrow? I'm human after all...and I got-a weakness for chicks. That's right. In this case, let's betray the-boss and help that family! He'll kill us. Since that day, I can't stop bleeding out of my ear. It wouldn't be strange-if you died right now. Let's use that to decide. That? One fair play to decide it. Help them or get killed. Yeah. I'm in! Help them or get killed! Here it goes! Help them. Boss. If we help that family, WE'RE the ones who get killed. If we get killed, it's because we helped that family. Please, think 'bout it. If we help that family, we get killed. Of course we will, 100%. But we were killed because we helped that family. That's right. That means They're the same either way! Why is that? Wait a sec...didn't you say you understand? They're the same either way! They're the same. Yeah. If they're the same, let's help 'em. If they're the same, let's help 'em. If they're the same, let's help 'em. No matter what, we're gonna get killed. If we're gonna get killed, it might as well be for helping that fine family. Okay. Let's go! So, let's clean. Pack up our bags. And leave the house clean and empty! Sorry, everyone. Because Dad's useless... What's this? It's a lottery ticket! What are the numbers? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7! Now for our next story. This year's winning Morning Jumbo Lottery numbers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2... 5, 6... 7! We won! We won! I don't believe it! Lucky! We won! Lucky! We won! We got something to tell ya! We do! You've got nothin' to worry 'bout! Nothin'! This promissory note.. Is eaten and gone! Now you're safe! Here you go. What's this? A lottery ticket Yep, it's a winner! 300,000,000 yen! 300,000,000 yen! 300,000,000 yen? Hurry up and spit it out! You swallowed it. I wonder... Give it to me for a sec. It's not switched on. It's fixed. Thanks. Aibon-sama! It looks like their wishes came true anyway. Aibon-sama! It looks like their wishes came true anyway. Maji dejima? Oh, yeah. What should I do? They've each got tone wish left. How about you switch them back? Ashita asatte shinasatte! [I'll do it tomorrow or the next day, same joke as before] Let's switch them back to the way they were! Here we go, switch places!
