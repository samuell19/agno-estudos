Subtitles by explosiveskull Sometimes it's hard to tell who's alive and who's dead. I think most people are scared of the dead. Not me. I see dead people all the time. This story doesn't have a picture perfect ending. Not everyone lives. And again, after what I've seen, I'm not sure death is what we think it is. So, this it, huh? I hate this fucking place. Shit, I thought it'd be bigger. Heard that a lot, huh? Shut the fuck up. This place ain't no joke. I'm not afraid of no old man. Then you're a dumb motherfucker. You don't know the shit that goes on in there. I heard he eats them. Like, he fries them up, and shit. You know why they call him The Candy Butcher? Because to him, blood is sweet. This son of a bitch has been bathing in it for years. I hear Terrance walked in on him. He was sewing people together in the back. Like Frankenstein shit. Yeah, so just think about that before you do something stupid. Hello. Hello. I'm looking for the... I'm looking for the butcher. May I ask who wants to know? No, you may not. Gloria. What did I tell you about answering the door? Go back inside. Cute kid. She yours? Can I help you? Yeah, I've got some trash, need taken care of. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. You should call the sanitation department. No, no, no, no. Chino told me what you do, and I need it done. This is not a drive through. Motherfucker, do I look like I want fries with that? So... We good? It's Lieutenant. We're settling vendettas. Don't worry, old man. There won't be any blood back on you. What's this? Excuse me? It's no kids. Look at him. He's just a boy. Not no more he ain't. No, I'm not going to take him. Look at him. There's no kids. That's the rule. No kids. The rule, we know the rules. You're in, and you're going to do what needs to get done. There's no other way out, old man. No. Nah, there is. Do it for your daughter. Excuse me? If not for you, do it for your daughter. Like I said, she's a cute kid. Look, my man. So, we good? Hey! Bodies are staying. The money? Well, that can go either way. We both know you don't really got an option here. So, what's their story? It doesn't matter. Can I help? That's enough for tonight. Okay, I want you to calm down. Just calm down. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no. Don't worry, I'll fix this. You best hope he comes through on this. Yeah, fuck you. He's going to make things right. What if he doesn't come back? Then we go in after him. Shit! Ah! If you don't calm down, you're going to rip your stitches open. Just stop it. You're just going to make it worse. Calm down. You've already lost a lot of blood. Calm down. Calm down. Easy now. Easy now. She ruined Mom's dress. It'll wash out. That won't make a difference. You left blood on the floor. You have to be more careful. So, what should we do with her? Well, just, just make sure that she's okay. And then what? Because I don't like her. She's just scared. Mom wouldn't want her here either. Well, she wouldn't. It's fine. You always say these people are bad. What if she's bad, and she wants to hurt us? Well, she's tied up. What if she's dangerous? You don't even know her. Mom wouldn't want her... Well, she isn't here, is she? You should have let her die. Hey! Gloria, I'm not a monster. You melt people in the back room. Dead people. Look, if we didn't save that girl, we'd be no better than they are. You understand? Yeah? Okay, Dad. Okay. If we get finished early, might be able to have some ice cream. Gloria? He's here. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. You're imagining things again. They're here. I can see them everywhere. Did you calm down a little bit? I will take the gag off if we have an understanding. Don't question where you are, why you're here, when you can leave. And don't scream. Nobody will hear you. If you scream, the gag goes back on, and doesn't come off. My daughter lives here. You put her in danger in any way, you will wish I let you die. Do you understand? Do you understand? I guess not yet. That's my mom's dress, you know. Just don't get too comfortable in it. We should get a few things straight. This is not your house, and you're not our guest. You're not allowed in my room, you're not allowed to borrow my clothes, my books, or my Cutie Pie doll. You're not allowed to touch my colored pens without permission, and most importantly, you are never, ever, ever going to touch my toothbrush. It's pink and blue. Just nod if you understand. Can I touch them? Your earrings. They're beautiful. He can't hear you. You can have them. Really? No, I can't. No, no, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, no. Your father won't notice. Don't worry. How do you know? Men don't notice things like that. Come on. Come on, they're pretty, right? Oh, they're going to look so good on you. This one. That's it. Yeah, they're pretty, huh? Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, no, please don't put it back. Just for a little while. It's hard to breathe. Little girl, can you undo these hand ties? They really hurt. My name is Gloria. Don't call me little girl. Gloria! That's a nice name. My name is Jackie. Could you undo these hand ties, please? Please? Come on, just one of them. Please. Gloria, come on. Thank you for the earrings. No. Mom wouldn't want her here. I don't want her here. I just wish she would go. She doesn't belong here. All she does is cry and scream. Anyways, he thinks bribing me will get me to like her. He's mistaken. They are nice, though. It's okay. You'll get used to it here. I promise. Gloria! Breakfast! Gloria! Aren't they pretty, Daddy? Gloria. What, what have you done? Where did you get these? Jackie gave them to me. Who's Jackie? Jackie. What the hell are you thinking, giving a little twelve year old those... Jackie. Gloria! I need you to go and get my emergency kit from the basement. It's a white, metal box, and it's right on the left, near the wall. Gloria! The basement? Yeah. No. Gloria. Mm-mm. She's in trouble. Now go and get it! Hurry up! Gloria! Put it down there, put it down there. Is that going to work? I'm O negative. We're going to find out. Jackie, come on. Please. I got, I got something. You got something? I don't meet many good people anymore. Maybe that's why my dad's trying so hard to be one. I think Jackie will be okay. But my mother's dress won't. It's stained. I don't want him to burn it, but blood leaves a trail, and we have rules here. Still, Mom loved that dress. Daddy says Jackie's just scared. I'm not sure why she would be afraid of us. We're just a normal family... normal for me, I guess. You're awake. I'm glad. Careful. You pulled your stitches out. By the time my dad found you, you were really white. Sometimes I don't know what's good for me, you know? Here. I got you some water. Thank you. Is that your mom? Yeah. Does she know what your dad's got you into? She would never let my dad keep bodies in the house. Leukemia makes people really sad. You know? Yeah, it does. Those look really nice on you. I did it this morning. Yeah, my dad wasn't too happy. He said I've got to take them out, but I wanted to show you first. I should go get him. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, you don't have... Don't. He'll want to know you're awake. Yeah, but just wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You don't need to. Dad! She's awake. How are you feeling? Sounds like you're more talkative with my daughter. What are you going to do with me? I have no plans to hurt you. Then why can't I go? Well, the people that dropped you off, I'm assuming they wanted you dead. They might not appreciate me ruining their plans. Dropped me off here. Why here? That's what people do. They dump dead bodies at my door. Wait. You're him. Hmm? You're that Candy Man guy, aren't you? The Candy Butcher. Oh, my God. You're not going to fucking eat me, are you? The group that brought you, and a couple of others, thought you were dead. Others with... Was my boyfriend with me? He has a tattoo under his eye, like a cross. Did you see him? No. What now? What, are you going to, like, fuck me or something? If I leave that gag off, can you please behave? I ain't going nowhere. You won't have to stay here much longer, anyway. I'm glad you're okay. There you go. To sunrises, and sunsets. To sunrises, and sunsets. One day you're going to be too old for milk and cookies. How come? You're not. Hey, Dad. Yeah. Are you going to miss it here? Well, we're going to take the good parts, keep them up here. How much packing do you have left? Not much. Okay. Hey, Dad. Yeah? I was thinking... Yeah. That maybe Jackie could come with us? No, I don't, I don't think so. Why not? Well, I don't think she'd want to. I think she would. I think she needs us. Tell me again about El Paso. El Paso. As dawn breaks, the sun peeks over the mountains, and casts long shadows over the desert. And the clean air tastes like spring shower after a long rain. And no snow. No snow. How are you feeling? I'm okay. You sure know how to sew up a bullet hole. My daughter's dolls give me a lot of practice. May I? Alright. You know, from the stories on the street, you don't seem like the type. I hope not. It's not my choice. Then why do you do it? I didn't want to. It just, it just happened. I was, I was married once. Happy. She was beautiful. Anyway, she got really sick. Leukemia. One night she was at a hospital, at the hospital, and this guy came to my door. His buddy had gotten shot in a hunting accident, and he needed my help. I did what I could, but he was too far gone. And he died right there on my table. So, when I tried to call the police, the first guy pulled a gun on me. They weren't, they weren't hunters. There was some kind of trouble, a robbery gone bad. The guy held us here for days, hiding from the cops. Eventually, his buddy's body started to rot. I got this wood stove in the basement. I burned his body in that. What happened to the guy? When the streets cleared, he peeled $10,000 off the money that they stole, and he gave it to me. He said I was on retainer, and that if I called the police he'd send his people after my daughter. In the end it was actually kind of a relief. I was... We couldn't afford to keep up with the cancer, I was going to lose this farm. It was... Necessary. Then Abby died. And the bodies kept coming. I couldn't do anything. If I refused, Gloria would never be safe. She's seen so much death here. This house. She even says that she sees them sometimes, that the house is... I have got to get her out of here. Alright, so, anyway, what about you? How do you do it? Do what? Well, generally, good people don't come here. Dead or alive. You stitch me up, and now you think you know me? I know bangers. They're all the same. Drugs, money, death, rinse, repeat. Yeah, I don't think you're the type to be preaching. You know what? On that one we agree. I never killed nobody. Maybe, maybe not. What about you? You cut up people in the back. They're already dead. Oh, is that what you tell yourself? I'm doing what I have to to get by. Yeah, well, so am I. We've all lost people, okay? You think you're the only person ever forced into a lifestyle? Dead bodies or not, you think this is the hard life? You don't know shit. You go out there one week, and then you come and talk to me about the hard life. You don't know me, or any of the people you cut up. You have no right to judge me, or what I do. I don't chop up strangers for a living now, do I? Get some rest. Do you think Jackie should come with us? You know, she's not as bad as she used to be. But it's nice to have her around. That's very nice of you to say, but I have to leave. But yes, I'll miss you, too. I don't know what's wrong with me. Oh, no. Sweetie, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. How old are you? Twelve. Nothing's wrong with you, okay? You're perfect. Yeah. Don't worry. You're going to be fine. You know, I can help you, but you just need to get something for me. Okay? Okay. Yes, yes, okay. Open it up. Yeah. Open it up, dump it out on the bed. It's probably at the bottom. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Now open it up. You got your period. Listen, this happens to all girls. Okay? If you have any problems, just come back. Got it? Got it. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Baby, baby, is that you? Wait, Jackie? Oh, baby, I need your help, okay? I don't know what he's going to do to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. Where are you? Are you okay? I don't, I don't know, okay. He's got me tied up. I don't know what he's going to do. Who, Jackie? Who tied you up? The Candy Butcher. He's real, baby. He's real. He's real, and he's here. Are you sure? Come get me, okay? Okay, okay, okay. Calm down. Um, Jackie, where are you? I don't know. Like, a farm, I think. I'm not sure. Okay, that's, that's good. Carter, I'm scared. I know, baby. I know. Look, you just, you got to be strong, okay? I'm coming for you. How are you going to find me? I'll find you. Just, just don't do anything that's going to piss this guy off, alright? Okay. You promise? Yeah, I promise. Okay, now get off the phone before he finds you. I love you. I love you, too. Oh! Gloria, baby? Baby, what happened? Dad, stop. Baby, what happened? Are you... Dad, stop. No, don't move. Let me just... No, no, no, no, no. ...have a look. Let me just see what's happening. Dad! Dad! Baby, let me just take a look. Dad! I'm a girl, alright! It happens! Oh, well... Oh, I, um... Oh, baby. I, uh... I'm... Where'd you get this? It was... Where did you get this?! It was, it was in my purse. How did you get it? I'm sorry. How? I'm sorry, I was just... You were just what, huh? You were just what? What is it you were just doing? Helping me, Dad. She was just helping me. Thanks for being so understanding. I'm sorry. I was just trying to help her. Unless you have some pads lying around. She is not supposed to be in here. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Thank you. Fuck! Yo! Yo, wait your turn. You stupid son of a bitch. What? What's wrong with you? Yo, bitch, get the fuck out. Oh, come on. No, wait. Wait. Yo, bitch, get the fuck out! Hurry up! Get the fuck out! You deaf? Yo, why is it that my girlfriend just called me, Reggie? You know, because that shit usually doesn't happen to bitches already dead. What? Yo, answer my question with a question one more time, motherfucker, and I'll put a bullet in your head, you understand? Yo, chill. Chill out, buddy. Alright? I took care of it. She's dead. I dropped her off at a place. At a place. Yeah. Let me guess, a farm? It's a farm, right? Yeah. How did you know that? Because the bitch just fucking told me, bro! Yo, Chino thinks my entire crew got killed in that hijack. If Jackie tells him that I'm still alive, he's going to know that I took his money. And if he finds out about our little side project here, that's me and you in that butcher's fucking bathtub, Reggie. Well, then I'll fucking take care of it. Take care of it like you took care of it before? Huh? I will handle it! Just shut the fuck up. Yeah, it's me, yo. I need a pick up in an hour. Yeah, bring DeMarco, too, and yo, bring heat. Everything you got. Just hurry the fuck up, Reggie. Gloria, Gloria, look at me, please. I just want to say I'm sorry about last night. I heard a gun shot, I saw you with the... I really don't want to talk about it. Okay. Fine. Alright. I'm just saying, if you ever do want to talk about it... Dad. Okay. Can Jackie come out for breakfast? I mean, I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? Because. Because why? I just, I don't really think she belongs here. Then where does she belong? Would you like some cereal, Jackie? It's high in fiber. Sure, thanks. You know, I recommend it with milk. My dad takes it straight. I'll try the milk. Good choice. To sunrises, and sunsets. To sunrises, and sunsets. So, Gloria, what do you want to be when you grow up? I'm not sure yet. At first, I thought I wanted to be a doctor, to help people, you know? Then I was thinking I could maybe do what my dad does. Oh! Not that part, just the raising farm animals part. But it would just be a milk farm. No more death. Right, Dad? Dad says when we get to El Paso, we don't have to deal with dead people anymore. Dad says you get to go home today, but I'm trying to convince him to let you come with us. Alright, Gloria, that's enough. Could you bring your suitcases down now, please? I need to speak to Jackie. Yeah. When you've finished your breakfast, I'm going to take you back in your room, and I'm going to give you a sedative. When you wake up, me and my daughter will be long gone. You'll be free to go. But you've got to promise me something. You've never seen us before. The last thing you remember, you got shot, and you woke up in a ditch somewhere. You understand? Mm-hmm. The only thing I care about in the whole world is that little girl. I want you to promise me that you're not going to put her in any danger. If you let me go, I will never speak of you or your daughter ever again. Okay. You got a good kid. Yeah. Okay, I'm ready. So, you coming, Jackie? I... No, Jackie's got a, she's got a life to live here. Yeah. I've got a boyfriend, and I've got to get back to him. A boyfriend? Yeah. I hope he treats you good. Daddy always says if you love someone, you should appreciate them every single day. Because you never know when something's going to take them away from you. Okay, okay. Put the suitcases in the car. Now, let's get this cleared up. Gloria, come inside. One second, Dad. Gloria, now! Who is that? Take Jackie to her room, now. Gloria, go to your room. But Dad, we were just... Go to your room! Alright, who's Carter? What? Just don't. Who's here? What did you tell them? What do you mean? Who?! He's my boyfriend, okay! I called my boyfriend! But he's not here to hurt anyone. Oh. Please, just let me talk to him! I just want to get out of here. You're not the only one. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Hey, yo, Candy. How's business? I'm not looking for any, if that's what you're asking. Yeah, you never are. You never are. Why is that? I mean, we're good customers, right? Right? I mean, we pay on time. So, where's the love? Where's the fucking love? Did you receive a complaint? Now, that's funny. That's funny. Hey, hey, Carter, did you know that Butch here had a sense of humor? Because, you know, dead bodies, they can't complain. I get it. Then why ain't you laughing? Huh? You're not laughing. Hey, Butch, if it's funny, why isn't he laughing? Maybe I should work on my delivery? Speaking of deliveries, the last one we did, three bodies? Two guys, and a chick? Yeah. Was there anything unusual about that delivery? Apart from the fact that one of them wasn't dead? Yeah. I'll go get her. Wait! Wait! Why the fuck didn't you tell me she was still alive? What was I supposed to do? Send you an email? Just go get her, and hurry up. We can take care of this peacefully. Get it over with. I'll be in the car. Daddy, what's happening? Please, please, they're going to kill me. You asked for this. You made the phone call! You asked these guys, you invited them to my home. To my home! With my daughter here! It's your fault! No, please! Please, please! No, Daddy, I don't want her to go! Gloria, go to your room! Daddy! Stop! Stop! Go! Please, please! Hey, there she is! Good to see you, Jackie. Come on, Willy. Send her on over. Dad! Willy, please, please, please. You don't have to do this. Please, they're going to kill me. They're going to kill me. Don't worry. We'll send her right back to you. You promise me my little girl's not going to die today. Hey, yo, Butch! Gloria, go in the basement and lock the door. I'm not going to tell you again. William! Don't go and do something stupid. Please, Gloria, baby girl, please. You wouldn't want things to get messy. Now! Thank you. Over there. Keep down, keep down. Get down! Get down! By the back! By the back of the door! Get out! Get out! Hey! Hey! You motherfucker! You're fucking crazy! Who is she to you, huh? Now shit's going to get fucking real! I'm going to take good care of your little girl, Butch! No one goes in the basement! Nobody! Hey, yo, Butch! Found your piggy bank! Maybe I give Gloria her allowance. Boo. Who the fuck are you? Little girl! What the fuck, Reggie? A warning, something. You scared the shit out of me. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuck. Find the rest. Fucking dick. The kid's mine. Jackie! Where you at, babe? Come on, Jacks. You lying sack of shit! Easy, easy! Look, I didn't want it to turn out this way. Fuck you! It's just business. Yeah, then finish the job. Fuck, T-Dogg! What the fuck? Jackie, what the fuck is this? You should be dead, motherfucker! Jackie! What the fuck? Little girl. Gloria! T-Dogg! Where the fuck you at? T-Dogg! Hey, Jackie! Baby girl, sweetie, honey! Come talk to your daddy's friend. Come on! Oh! Gloria! Dad! Fuck! Dad! Dad! Oh, hey there, Butch. Please. Really? Let her go! No. All you had to do was give us the bitch. But you had to go and be a fucking hero. So now, hero, put down the fucking gun, or I shoot her in the fucking head. Okay. Okay. Put down the gun. Okay. Get on your knees. Get on your fucking knees! Good boy. Hey, yo, Carter. We're down here. Yo! Ah, fuck it. Oh! Daddy! No, no! Dad! No! Look at me, Butch. Stop. Look at me. It's okay, baby. Please, please. Look at me. No, no, no, no! No, stop! What? What the fuck? We've got to... Can I help? I don't know what to do, Dad. It's okay, baby. It's okay, baby. It's okay now. No, no. Jackie! It's okay, Gloria. No, no, I can fix you. Gloria. I can fix you. I can fix you, I can. It's okay. It's okay, baby. No, no, no. I can do it. I can do it. Please, God. God, please. Daddy, Daddy. Baby. Daddy, I... It's okay, baby. You're safe now. Shh. But you've got to get up, Dad. You've really got to get up, please. No, come on, Daddy! Please! Come on! You can't leave! You can't leave me, please! I promise I can fix you. Please, just... Everything. Everything that's ever been good about me is right here. It's right here. And it always will be. So, you see, I could never leave you. I could never leave you. Come on. To sunrises. Mm-hmm. And sunsets. I love you, Dad. No, no. No, no, no! No, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! Please. Bye. I think people do bad things for good reasons. My dad was a good man... did bad things, but he did them for me. Good bye, Daddy. Subtitles by explosiveskull
