- Does it hurts? - No, It just made a lot of noise. You could hold on for another minute baby. I want a red crayon! - What's happening? - Must be the power... -What the hell? -Sarah Sarah! I'm gonna get you out. Release the bed! Don't fight us honey! I want a red crayon. Hey, here it is. You'll gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay huh Daddy's here. You'll be risking her health, if you take her home now. Can't you just push a button and get her diagnosis? It's a process of elimination. I know it's slow but we have to go through all the process on her symptoms. Just to find out what's actually happening I just want her to feel better. I don't think there's anybody in the world can do more for we've done already Haven't you talk to her? Have you listen what she had to say or we just stuck her on that damn machine? Sir, she's repeating the same thought over and over.. I want the red crayon. I don't think we have, is pink ok? I'm really sorry, the problems we've had with our equipment lately. I'm sure all this has been very exhausting for you. Have you considered taking her to an institution? Especially now... - I've considered taking her to another hospital. - You should think about it, it's a big decision. Sarah is my daughter. All decisions we consider are big. - Try to get some sleep ok? It will do you good - No not again... - Try to get some sleep ok? It will do you good - No not again ... Sleep tight baby, sure the bed bugs don't bite. Love you. I really, really want to go home. Hey Hey, wake up. Let's get you out of here. Let's take you somewhere where they'll listen to you huh? I want a red crayon. What are you doing? Look, don't do anything you'll regret later. I want a red crayon Let us keep her here for tonight. I know what's best for my daughter. You have to believe me.If I knew a better place for her, I'll take here there myself You think you know better than me because you have meters and meanings. You didn't know what's going on. Look, she doesn't even want to leave. Your great machines just caught a fire with her inside of it! I know that, but she needs to stay. We're trying a new one. Get you own bed in the med, Tobias. If we stop the medication, -- she could develop a more serious condition. And it will have to keep her here a lot longer. Not six, not seven. Not hell and not heaven. - Everybody alright? - Yeah, were alright but this elevator sure isn't. Tobias. Tobias Quit messing around man. Tobias. Tobias. Call for help! This is Rick security. We're stuck in the elevator 6 -- we need help now, It's an emergency. Hello? Hello? This is Rick security. We're stuck in the elevator 6 -- we need help now, It's an emergency, Hello?. Why don't you just let me die? Jesus Christ. Where is everyone? Is there repairs going on? There should be... There should be patients here. And staff. Shhh -The air-conditiong -What? -It's Off It's a god damn fire drill. - Alright, let's take the stairs. - Good. It's locked. Can't you see? Can't you see? I'm gonna lose this nerve. - Is there another door? - Maintenance staircase in the other wing. Can't you see? What are we doing standing here? Where is it? Thank you. Come on, let's go. What's that noise? Why don't we just find an exit. Are all the machines out of order today? They should've turn them off before they left You coming or not?. - I don't understand, can't we just get the hell out of here. -There's no way out of here. The maintenance staircase is open, it's just the end of the hall - Sarah should take her medicines. - What medicine? As I was saying before, we're testing a new drug for epilepsy - Epilepsy? - Yeah, the doctors think that might be the reason. Who gave them permission to test this new drug on her? Unlike the old drug this drug won't damager her liver. Sure, of course. Look, if we discontinue the use of this medication, the effects could be fatal. What is that? It's coming from over there. Excuse me, Ma'am. Ma'am. - What the hell is going on here? - I don't care it's none of our business. Let's get out of here please. Did you people hear what I said? Let's get out of here, we need to call for help. She has no eyes ,sees it all. Makes no difference, they know where we are at all times. - Stop it. - Not me, they can't see me. Hello? Can anyone here me? Is anyone there? Can anyone here me? Is anyone there? What the hell is going on here? Why don't we all just get out of here? Come on, let's go. After you, you're security. You go first. Come on. We need to get down right? Let's go. My God. What was that? Hey, who's there? Go! What the hell was that? What was it? There is only one hell. - Sit down. - This is just a scratch. - Why don't we make a camp fire and sing songs while we're at it. Hey, Calm down. While somebody's running around tearing peoples eyes out, you want me to calm down? Don't pay attention to him honey. Okay? Ben. Look a bright light or a loud noise can trigger a seizure. we need to stay calm. - What is that?? - I haven't heard it before. We can't stay here, we have to find our way out of here. I'm not going down that stairs again. There's an info desk on the other wing. Let's go. Sarah, wait. Where are we going? - You think the infodesk people have a solution to this? - You know another way to go? - No. - Exactly. The rain stopped. It's almost too quiet. The whole hospital is empty. There's not even a dialtone. Hello, Hello, we're on the north wing on the fifth floor We need some help. I repeat... If there something here prying peoples faces, -- You really wanna announce on the microphone that we're stuck on the fifth floor? Look! They're on the third floor. What was that? - At least we are not alone here. - Who gives a shit, just get us out of here. - I don't give a shit. - To protect is your job. Is there anyone else wondering where all the people are? Let's take these, we might need them. - You know how to use them? - Sure. Where is Sarah? Sarah! Sarah? Sarah? Sarah. Sarah are you ok? Sarah, honey? - Are you ok? - Yeah, everything's ok. Let's just get out of here. - What's in that room? - I don't know. Stop, Ben. There's no time like the present... There's no time like the present... and it's gonna get colder and colder and it's gonna get colder and colder Hello? The number you dial is not in service at this time. Come on! This is not happening, this is not happening. What was that? Go! I need to switch this off. No don't. Maybe it scared that thing off. What the hell was that? You've seen that before Tobias? I saw you cover your ears before she even started. So why was that? The Scream Queen. The what? You tell me. What are they doing, Ben? Why are they here huh? You know the answer. The emptiness. This is a hospital, and they're doing some repairs. Maybe they hit a gas pipe and were -- all high and hallucinating. hallucinating the same thing at the same time? No, it could be that I'm hallucinating all of this, all of you Yeah, and you're wearing a night gown, and we're all gonna wake up in any minute. The X-Ray, If we stay here for too long we're gonna be exposed to the radiation. Cancer is not gonna kill any of us. This is shit. You don't want to go out there. This is bullshit, this is just a mass psychosis a body with no eyes ... But we all saw it god-damn it. Yes we did, but it's time to use a little common sense. Fool. I guess the rest of us should stay together. So what do we do now? Take the X-Ray machine on our way for help. When is Sarah suppose to take a medication? Soon. What happens if she doesn't get it? Help! Help! - What was that? - Jon! Help, get me out of here! Open the door! Help me out! To die... is beautiful. Watch out! Perfect girl. Tobias, what are you doing? It doesn't hurt. Dying is easy. Stop. You don't know what are you doing. Oh I know what I'm doing. I know it a hundred times. Tobias. I promise you will sleep. Do you know how it feels, when it's cold ... ... really cold? - He looks ok. - Let's pull him out. Hang in there. What the hell did this? It's all falling apart, everything's falling apart Are you feeling ok? Have you seen that? Have you? I want a red crayon. I want a red crayon. Just as soon as we get home. - How are you feeling? - Hurts like hell. That freaking rent-a-cop and his sidekick hit me. You know, you should be thankful your head's still on your shoulders. You almost got us killed. Me? If you don't have to drag that retarded kid around with us. We'd be out of here already. Is this real? huh? Stop. Mass psychosis huh? Somebody has to take control of the situation. This situation can't be control, not by you, not by anybody. Not by you either. No. Shhh Its the intercom. - I think I've heard that before. - You should know what that is. Hello, is anyone there? - Hello? - Hello? Hello? What floor are you on? - We're on the ... floor. - What floor? What floor? Hello? At least we know we're not alone. Oh yeah, a lot of good is gonna do us for we all in the same shit Let's find them. Come on. What the hell? They blocked this exit. Come on rambo, do something useful. Find us a real way out. You wanted out. - Are staircases behind this? - Yeah, I think so. So much for that. We have to go. Come on. - What the hell happen here? - Only God know what happen here. Walter! No! Walter. The only sensible solution is to give up the girl ... give up the girl ... ... give up the girl ... give up the girl ... It's up to you. It's all up to you. Let's go. Nobody survived. - Tobias, come! - Let's go! Go! - Ben! - Take her! Go! - Go! - Come on get out of there! Do it! Why did he have to be a god damn hero? Nobody ask him to be... - Get off of me! - Come on! Looks clear. - They want the girl you know. - How'd you know that? Isn't it obvious,the ghost, the old man's stories, the tape. You starting to believe this. You'll get us killed if you don't... You think I'll let them kill my daughter to save you? And yourself, and the nurse. What if the old man was right? What if it all depends on you? What's happening? Hello? Hello? - What floor are you on? - We're on the third floor. - What floor are you on? - We are on... - Why'd you hangup? - It was me. What do you mean it was you? It was the same call I made earlier. - There has to be some explanation for this. - Maybe an echo. Maybe you accidentally recorded something. Maybe it's some kind of parallel dimension thing you know. Like one world on top of another. My watch is stopped. All the clocks have stopped. - What does that mean? - I don't know what it means. But time has stopped. Just not moving. Look. - How can time stop? - I don't know. - What is it? - She needs to take her medicine. Where do we get it? The emergency room bed It's behind that blocked wall. You stay here. We'll clear that wall. Maybe if you do get out of here? What are you gonna do with time stopped? Right now, I just wanna get my child the hell out of here. Let's all worry about that later. Sarah everythings gonna be ok. Daddy's gonna get you out of here ok? Can you watch her. Don't even lay a finger on her. You won't live to regret it. No. No. That's the fastest way down. Have you uhm... see Sarah's drawings? - Yeah, I've seen a lot of them - What do you make of 'em? I think she knows something we don't. Do not start with that. Ben, When you were gone, I heard Sarah speak with Tobias. I didn't hear what she said, but she speak clearly and didn't repeat herself She's just a little girl. Why is everyone keep saying she is the reason for this? And what if she is? I touched Tobias' hand, it was cold. It was like he was dead. What's this? Sand? - Guns never really helped. - Yeah, but we never know. What are you drawing? That's ok, you don't have to show me. That's ok. You know Sarah's gonna be ok. Do you have children? I have a boy, he's four. And the father? I haven't seen him in a couple of years. I'm sorry. Don't be. He was not the kind of man who ... - What was that? - I don't know. What the hell? This was Jons'. He dropped it remember? - Hey wait. - I need to tell them. I just shot rick in the head. Think they say, if they saw you? Come on, why don't you and I take a little walk? Have a lot of fun. Shhh - What? - Did you hear that? What the hell is that? Come and get her! You can take her. You can have her. Come and get her! We just wanna get out. She's here, you can have her. She's not yours. - What if it really is true? - What? If I don't give up Sarah, this is never gonna stop. If they wanted Sarah, why don't they just take her? Hello? Hello? The teddy bear ... Sarah ... - Tobias? - Sarah. You are one of them. Have you ever been cold? I mean really, really cold. Cold enough for you? Sarah! Sarah! Here she is! Sarah! No, no, no ... Sarah! Sarah! Everything's ok. Who is that? Ben. - Is he dead? - It's like he's been dead for a week. We have to go. We should be able to reach ground floor from here. Get the chair. No, not there. Do you know how to get out from here? Can you draw it for me? This way? I think we can find Sarah's medicine in here. - Did you find it? - No. Will you check that one. Could be some other way out through the garage Yeah, the Staff go through the mortuary to reach the garage. even if the Chief tells them not to. That'll make the Chief make an exception. Oh shit! Sarah! Look! She can't go fall, You check over there I'll check this way. - You Keep your walkie-talkie on. - Okay. Sarah! Sarah? Sarah!? Ben. Can you hear me? Ben? Emily, talk to me, where are you.
