All right, fingers on the glass. Ali? What's the matter? You're not scared, are you? - I don't know. I don't know if this is a good idea. - Oh, it can't hurt you. Everybody does it. - Yeah, come on. Mum and Dad will be home soon. - Right. - Now. Is there a spirit in the room? - Maureen, look, if you don't want to take this seriously. - Sorry. - Is there a spirit in the room? If there's a spirit in the room, please move the glass towards the yes button. - Oh, nothing's happening. Can we go home now? - Shut up, Ali. Is there a spirit in the room? Is there a spirit in the room? Is there anyone there? If there is a spirit in the room, please move the glass towards the yes. Move the glass towards... It's working. - Hey, you two pushed it. - No, we didn't. Put your finger back. Come on. Can you tell us what your name is? A. L. S. Alison? Your name's Alison? You have a message for Alison. What's the message? Don't go. 19. Birth. Birthday? - We don't understand. Who is it? Who is it? Uh! Alison! - Chrissie? - Alison! You have to get away, away from them before birthday. They want you for Mirne. Don't let them take you. - Chrissie, that's not funny. Stop it. - Listen! Have to listen to me. Terrible danger. - Who are you? - Your father. - What? - She's coming. Mirne's coming. Finding me! Uh! Get away from them! Get away! ♪ We arrived from a far away land ♪ - Yeah, reckon I'll have this one. - It's sort of out of your usual line, isn't it? Thought you were more into Benny Goodman? - That's $7.99. Thanks, Mr. Martin. - Hey, well, a man has to broaden his horizons from time to time. Thank you. Save you round about that. Bye. - Oh, it's near enough to closing time. Might as well get out of here. - Oh, having lunch with Don today, are you? - Alison? - Yup? Pack it in, let's call it a day. Well, so there's another action-packed week in the life of a country record seller. Have a good weekend, you too. - You too, Maggie. - See ya. - See ya. - 415817 is the number to call, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can't ask for more than that, can you? Right, two and a half minutes left of this sunny Saturday morning in southeastern New South Wales. The full weather details for ya straight after the midday news. ♪ Jenny, you were my days ♪ ♪ Jenny, you were my nights ♪ ♪ Jenny, you took my wrongs ♪ ♪ And made them feel right ♪ Morning, my son. Good day, mate. They're all yours. - Right. This thing playing up again? - Yeah, runnin' through the queues. You have to stop it manually. - Uh-huh. Hi. - Good day. - Ali. - Are we finished? - Got another 30 seconds. And that's my lot for the day. It's 15 seconds to 12. The news coming up and Dave Ducker to see you safely, with any luck, sanely through the afternoon. Until Monday, this is Pete Healey wishing you well. - Thank you, Peter, and it's 12 midday. - How many times have I told you not to bring that thing in here when the mic's on? You might like the sound of feedback, but our station manager doesn't. - Sorry. Forgot. - Supposed to be taking you out tonight or something, am I? - Or something, yeah. - Oh, well. Where would you like to go? - Well, taking into account our respective bank balances, I thought maybe we could go to my place. I could cook us a couple of steaks. We could watch some television or go cockroach hunting or anything else exciting that may suggest itself. - Now that sounds like my idea of a great night out. You're on. I just want you to tell me where you were when your husband was murdered. How many times must I tell you, Lieutenant, I simply do not remember. - Got it. - What? - I got it all figured out. It's the two kids. - Hey? - The two kids killed the old man. - What are you talking about? He died of a heart attack! - Yeah, but he wouldn't of if he'd taken the pills. - He practically swallowed a whole bottle before he died. It didn't do him any good. - Because the kid switched the pills. Remember the missing vitamin tablets. Then when the secretary came in, he found the body, and he stuck- - Can we just watch the program, please? - I'm right, you'll see. I'm always right. All you have to do is remain perfectly calm. Now why don't you go upstairs and get some rest? All right, I'll try. Goodnight, my dear. Who's there? Is someone there? Yeah? Alison. - Oh, hi Auntie Jenny. Hang on a tick. Long distance. Hi, how are you? - I'm very well, dear. And you? Terrific. How's Uncle Dean? - Oh, he's quite well, dear. He sends you his love. Give him mine. - I'll do that. Alison, we wondered when you'd be coming home. - Home. - Well, yes, dear. For your birthday next week. We thought you might be coming home. - You know I'd love to, Aunt Jenny, but I'd have to get time off work and everything and it's just- - I know that, dear, but I thought if they understand how important it was, they wouldn't mind. Well, just for a few days. - Well, I don't really understand why it's so important, either. I mean, if it was my 21st or something, but it's not. It's just another birthday. - Alison, I didn't want to have to tell you this yet, but, well, it's your Uncle Dean. He really isn't very well. The doctors, well, they say he hasn't a lot of time. - Oh, no. - I don't want you to worry, but you know how much he loves you and how much your birthdays have always meant to him, and it, well, it might be the last chance the family have to be all together. - Oh, Aunt Jenny, I'm so sorry. I don't know what else to say. I had no idea. - How could you? But do you see now why it would mean so much to have you home here with us? On your birthday? - I'll come, of course I'll come. - Oh, that's wonderful, dear. It'll make Uncle Dean very happy. When can we expect you? - Uh, as soon as I can get there. I don't know, maybe tomorrow. - Whenever you can. And we'll have your old room all ready for you. And I'll give Uncle Dean your love. Goodbye, dear. She's coming. - Problem? - I have to go home. It's my birthday on Wednesday and I have to go home for it. - You don't sound too thrilled. - It's my 19th birthday. - Ah. - Well, I was sort of warned once that I shouldn't go home for my 19th birthday. - Why not? - I don't know. - You want to tell me about it? - Ah, couple of years back when I was still at school I sort of got involved in a ouija board seance. One of the other girls, Chrissie, said I was in danger from a person called Mirne. And it was somehow connected with my 19th birthday. It's really freaky. Everything went crazy. Furniture started blowing around the room and Chrissie kind of lunged forward and grabbed at this pendant. Then the bookcase fell on her and it all stopped. I don't remember much after that. There were police and ambulance, but I don't remember much about it. - Why police and ambulance? - Chrissie. She was dead. - Oh, wow. - Oh, I know how it must sound, but that's what happened. I guess that's why I'm a bit uptight about going home right now. - Then don't. - Oh, I owe them that much. - Who? - My aunt and uncle. They've always been really good to me. They've looked after me all my life as if I were their own daughter. My mum and dad were killed in an accident when I was a baby. There's always been just Aunt Jenny and Uncle Dean. Always there when I wanted them, never asking for anything in return. I can hardly turn my back on them now. - But you're still uptight about going. - Yeah. - Okay, how about if I come with you? My old man lives in Sydney and I'm overdue for holidays. - Yeah? That would be great. Thanks. What time do you think we'll get there? - Should be there about half past four. - Suppose you're worrying what kind of a nut you've got yourself involved with after all that stuff I laid on you last night. - No. - Do you believe in ghosts, possessions, all that? - 1 did a program on it a couple years back. Some of the things I saw shook me up a bit. Banns in some near places so on account I decided to leave it alone after that. I don't really know what I think about it. - You never told me about that. - Well, I didn't know then that you were interested in the subject. - I'm not, but ever since that night I've kind of had the feeling that the subjects are interested in me. It's just up ahead where those trees are. - Tree? What trees? I don't see any trees. Oh. - Having a little pain there? - Oh, just a slight touch of acute gangrene. Nothing to worry about. - Well, I wouldn't mention it in front of Aunt Jenny, not unless you want to get hit with one of her famous medicinal potions. - Ah-ha. - A brew for every occasion, and an occasion for every brew. My stomach and I did not have any easy childhood. - You seem to have survived all right. - Alison! - Hi, Aunt Jenny. - Oh, dear. Let me look. Well, you haven't been eating properly. How often have I told you natural nutrition is the key to good health? Never mind. Should get some color in those cheeks. You must be Peter. - Now look who we have here. Hi, Uncle Dean. - Mmm, my dear child, you look absolutely radiant. And anyone who says you're not will have to answer to me. Country life obviously agrees with you. - Dean, this is Alison's young man, Peter. - Oh, nice to meet you, young man, I'm sure. - Hi. - Look, Dean. She's wearing the pendant. I hope it's not because you're visiting us. - Of course not. You know I always wear it. - It was a gift from her Uncle Dean, you see. He gave it to her when she first came to us when she was, well, just a tiny baby. - Come on, my dear. Peter doesn't want to hear about all that. Here, I'll take these. - I know what you're thinking. He doesn't look ill. But he's trying hard not to show it and he doesn't know I've told you. Thank you for bringing Alison home, Peter. It was really nice meeting you. - You're welcome. You gonna be okay? Yup. - All right then. See you tomorrow. Mmm-hmm. Come along inside, dear. - My god, it's the kid. - Sure is. Hey, can I borrow the living room sofa for a couple of days? - I guess so. What is this? A snap inspection or something? - Well, I tried to call you last night to let you know I was coming, and again first thing this morning, but you, uh, didn't seem to be home. - No, well, uh, I guess I wasn't. You're looking reasonably fit, anyway. - You, too. And still making more money than you know what to do with judging by that Rover in the driveway. - Oh, that. Just a cardboard cutout. Came off the side of a Corn Flakes packet. - I thought so, but I wasn't gonna say anything just in case you didn't want the neighbors to know. - I put Alison's things in her room. - Thanks, Uncle Dean. - Why don't you go upstairs and unpack while I wash up down here? I've tidied up your cupboards. You'll find lots of space to hang your clothes. - Oh, I don't have that much to unpack. I might take a walk down the backyard, stretch my legs a bit. - Well, don't go down past the old stone fence. It's terribly overgrown down there. There are snakes and spiders and, oh, goodness knows what. - You know, I'm starting to wonder what you two are hiding down there. - How do you mean, dear? - Well, you used to tell me that when I was a kid. What sinister secret lies hidden behind the old stone wall? - Well, I don't know if there are any vampires down there, but there certainly are snakes. Your Uncle Dean was nearly bitten by one, oh, just two weeks ago. We don't want you spending your birthday in hospital, do we? - No, suppose not. - We thought you'd gone to sleep out here. - Oh. - Jennifer's got your dinner on the table. - I went down the back. - Ooh, you shouldn't have done that. Your aunt's right about those snakes and crawlies. I must go in there and clean it up one of these days. - 1 didn't see any snakes, but I saw something else that I thought was pretty strange. - Oh? What was that? - There's a kind of clearing with some old stone blocks in it. Sort of like a miniature Stonehenge. - That's exactly what it is. Man who built this house was an amateur astronomer. He was one of the first to come up with the idea that the ancient British monuments were primitive observatories, so he had that scale model built to try out some of his theories. - Oh. - Now, how about we go in and try out some of Aunt Jenny's roast beef and Yorkshire pudding? - All right. Alison, you're wanted on the phone, dear. Peter. Oh. - Don't be long. Food will get cold. - Hi. - Hi. What's up? - Nothin'. Just got the feeling a might lonesome, is all. - Yeah, me too. - So, how are things? - Oh, okay, I guess. I guess? - No, everything's fine. How about you? - Alison? - Ah, I better go. Mealtime. See you tomorrow, huh? - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. - I'm exhausted! - Of course you are. Too old fogies like your aunt and me, rambling on till all hours. It's enough to exhaust anyone. - Now you know that's not true. I'm just tired from the drive down, that's all. - Still, it was naughty of us to keep you up so late. - It's like stepping back into time to my childhood. It's like you've had the whole room wrapped up in cellophane and took it out five minutes before I walked in. - Well, it is your room, dear. We thought we'd like to leave everything just as it was, ready for you to come home whenever you wanted to. And now here you are, back with us. - I'm only here for a couple of days, Aunt Jenny. - I know that, dear. I brought you a cup of herbal chocolate. Help you sleep. - Another one of your secret potions? - Yes, and it's a natural vitamin tonic as well, so drink it up, nice and hot. - Come along, my love. Alison's gotta get some sleep. - Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight. - Grandmother Thorne, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be out of bed. Dean, take her back to her room. It's all right, Alison, dear. There's no need to be alarmed. It's only Grandmother Thorne. - Who the hell is Grandmother Thorne? - She's your great-grandmother. She's come out from England to be here for your birthday. - You never told me I had a great-grandmother. - I'm sure we have. You've forgotten, that's all. Well, she hasn't seen you since you were just a tiny baby. Was very silly of her getting out of bed like that. She's 103 years old and the trip out here was almost too much for her. The doctors say she has to stay in bed for a day or two and rest. We didn't tell you she was here. Well, we wanted to surprise you. - She sure did that. - Well, I imagine she was so excited at the thought of seeing you, she just couldn't resist taking a little peek. Now, try and get a good night's sleep, dear. Goodnight. - Oh, boy. - Morning, dear. You sleep well? Yeah. - Alison, Grandmother Thorne asked me to say that she was sorry about last night. She didn't mean to frighten you. - Oh, that's okay. I guess I kind of overreacted a bit. - I told her you'd understand. She wanted me to take you to visit in her room, but I had to say no. She's gotta rest and build up her strength for your party. Now, what would you like for breakfast? - Oh, I'll just fix myself some toast and have a cup of tea. Peter will be here soon. - Are you planning to go out then? - Oh, we thought we might take a run up to one of the beaches. - Oh. Well, we were rather hoping you'd spend the day with us. We haven't seen you in such a long time. - Oh, that's right. And there's lots to talk about. Arrangements for the party and all that. Well, your relatives will be coming. Patrick, Ivy, your cousin Richard, Aunt Marjorie. - Auntie Iris is flying down from Queensland. Now you haven't seen her, I don't know how- - That'll be Pete. Um, look, I won't stay out late. I'll talk to you about it tonight, okay? - Have a nice day. 103 and she's still spritely enough to go prowling around the house in the middle of the night. - Well, I wouldn't exactly call her spritely. She is the oldest-looking person I've ever seen, especially those eyes. The way she kept staring at me, so cold and kind of hungry. Something else I noticed, too. She was wearing a pendant exactly the same as this one. - Well, maybe they're a set. You know, family heirlooms or something. - Maybe. There's something about that house, Pete. I guess it's always been there, but I've never really been aware of it. Now coming back after being away for so long, I really feel it. - How do you mean? - I don't know, just something. Last night after I finally got to sleep, I had nightmares all through the night. I don't remember much about them except that they were pretty frightening. I remember I kept trying to wake myself up to get away from whatever it was, but I couldn't. I think it was something to do with the stones. Down the backyard there's this weird place, a kind of stone circle hidden in the trees. Pete? - Yeah? - This party, will you come? - Sure. If you want me to. - I want you to. - When is it? - Wednesday night, starting at seven o'clock, the exact time I was born, so they tell me. - Well, you've gotta give them marks for precision, anyway. Okay, seven o'clock Wednesday. That should be fun. Play spin the bottle with great-granny and all your old maiden aunts. We better think about heading back. Looks like we're gonna get rained on before long. - I'd rather not go home just yet. - Well, we could always go to my old man's place. There won't be anyone there. - Okay. ♪ Silver girl ♪ ♪ There was love, there was pain ♪ ♪ And I'll never be the same again ♪ You have something against my choice of music? No, I just feel like listening to the rain for awhile. Ah, well, why not? - I know it's something we haven't talked about much, the way we feel about each other. Well, I guess there hasn't been any real need. But just for the record, in case you've ever been wondering, well, I guess I'm kind of in love with you. - You are now? I guess I'm kind of the same. - Your dad's not likely to walk in, is he? - Ah, he's pretty broadminded. Besides, he said he'd like to meet you. - Yeah, I'd like to meet him, too, but I prefer it to be a time when I was dressed and vertical. - Don't worry. He's got a competition shoot on at the pistol club. He won't be home for hours. - Oh, that's what I wanted to hear. - Hi. Hmm. - It's getting late. You don't have to go back, do you? - Ah, it's only a couple more days. I guess I can handle it. Come on. See you later. Pete, can we go out again somewhere tomorrow? - Sure. We could go for a run up the mountains, if you like. - They're not gonna like it. I can't stay in there all day. Nights are bad enough. Will you listen to me? I sound like a frightened kid. I wish I could figure out exactly what it is I'm scared of. Pete, I'll be glad when Wednesday's over. - I'll pick you up about half past eight, okay? - Okay. - I wonder if I could have a word with you, Peter. - Sure. - Naturally, it's about Alison. Her Aunt Jennifer and I haven't seen her for some time, and, oh, we're looking forward very much to having her with us these few days. I mean, it's only natural that we'd like her to spend a little more time at home. - Well, that's really up to Alison, isn't it? - Well, yes, of course, but we thought perhaps if you could stay away just a few days, at least until after Wednesday. - Sorry, but we've already made arrangements for tomorrow and for Wednesday. - You can't have. Wednesday's the party. - I know. Alison's invited me. - Well, she had no right to do that. - It is her party. - It's a family party. Just members of the family, that's all. I'm afraid you won't be able to come. - Unless Alison says otherwise, I'll be there. - Now listen to me, boy. You're meddling in something you can't begin to understand. My advice to you is stay well away from this house and from Alison. - Why? Because he's my friend, that's why, and I want him to be here! - But Alison, you're being very silly. Now you know that we planned for just a family party. Well, no outsiders, just family. - Besides, it's hardly fair to your friend. I mean, you can't expect him to enjoy himself. He simply won't fit in. He doesn't know anybody. - He knows me! But dear, there aren't - I'm sorry, Aunt Jenny! I've invited him, he's accepted, and that's it! Now I'm going to bed. Goodnight. - Just a minute, young one. - Oh, listen, Dean, it's quite obvious that Alison has made up her mind. I think we should just, well, leave it for the moment. Now Alison, you're not going to bed without something to eat. - I'm not hungry. - Well, at least let me give you your tonic. There you are. There. There, now try and get a good night's sleep. Alison, don't worry. Everything will be all right. - The situation with the boy's become impossible. Something has to be done. - Oh, it already has been. And don't worry, everything will be all right. - Good. - Mirne. Mirne. Come now angel of the darkest night. Mistress of the great old ones. I beg thee come to us. I, thy humble servant, Isobel Thorne, offer thee my body. Come, mistress Mirne. Come to me. Possess me. Possess me! Possess me! Possess me! Possess me! Hail, Mirne. Hail, Mirne. Hail, Mirne. Hail, Mirne. Hail, Mirne. Hail, Mirne. Hail, Mirne! Hail, Mirne! Hail, Mirne! Hail, Mirne! Hail, Mirne! Hail, Mirne! - Yes? I'm here to pick up Ali. She's expecting me. - Oh, she hasn't come down yet. I imagine she's still asleep. - I'll wait. - You better come in then. It's Peter come to see Alison. - Oh, uh. Well, I'm sorry, she's still asleep. I'll go and wake her. - Pete? - Ali, what's the matter? - Dear now! - Here. - Let me see. Dean, take her back to her room. - I can manage. - This way. I wouldn't worry too much. Mild case of nervous exhaustion, that's all. Most important thing is to make sure she stays in bed and rests for a day or two. - Oh, thank you, Doctor. I'll see she does it. - Well, I'll be off then. - Thank you. - I'll see you out. Thanks again, Doctor. - Let me know if you have anymore problems. - Yes, of course. - Excuse me. Doctor? Yes? - This might sound a bit strange, but, well, just suppose that whatever's wrong with Ali isn't nervous exhaustion. What else could it be? - There's no point in supposing. I assure you that's what it is. - Look, she's not a nervous person, not normally. It's only since she's been in that house that she's been under pressure. - What exactly are you suggesting? - I'm not sure. That's why I'm asking you. - I think you're letting your imagination get the better of you. She'll be all right in a couple of days. - You heard what Dr. Lyle said. She needs to rest. I'm sure she'll call you when she's feeling better. What about the party? - In view of Alison's illness, it will of course have to be canceled. Now if you'll excuse me. - Yes, I'm trying to find the telephone number for a Dr. Lyle. He's not listed in the directory and I don't know the address. I thought it might've been in your listing. Thanks. What, no listing at all? Thanks for your trouble. Hello, Mrs. Finlay. It's Pete Healey here. Yeah, I was wondering if I could speak to Alison. - I'm afraid not, Peter. She's still asleep. But when she wakes I'll tell her you called. - Okay, thanks. - Ali. Ali! It's okay, hon. It's only me. - Pete. - You all right? - I think so. It's just, oh, wow. - What? - I was having the granddaddy of all nightmares. Same as before, only this time I can remember it. There were a whole lot of people chanting some sort of black magic ceremony. And Aunt Jenny and Uncle Dean and Grandma Thorne were there, and I was there, too, only it wasn't me. And it's all mixed up. Oh, Pete, what is happening to me? - Nothing, baby, nothing. It's only a dream. It can't hurt ya. Just a dream. - I'm glad to see you. Do they know you're here? Afraid they don't approve of you. - Yeah, well, that works both ways. - Oh, they're good people, Pete. It's just that they're locked into this little gingerbread house fantasy of theirs. They can't accept the fact that I'm not part of it anymore. Trying like mad to pretend I'm still eight years old, especially Uncle Dean. And I guess it doesn't make it any easier to have you knocking on the door every five minutes. - Maybe. I'm starting to wonder if it isn't something more than that. - How do you mean? - I'm not sure yet. I think I'll have a look around. - What for? - If I knew that, I wouldn't have to look. Where do your aunt and uncle sleep? I don't want to go bumping into them. - Ah, the other side of the stairs. - Okay, I won't be long. You take it easy. Come on, I'm getting you out of here. - What's the matter? - There's something pretty weird going on in this place, and I've got a feeling it's not a good place for you to be right now. Come on, get your things together. You all right? - Yeah, I think so. - Look, I'll do that. You get dressed. Go back to bed, Alison. - I'm sorry, Aunt Jenny. I don't want to stay here anymore. I'll call you in the morning and let you know what I'm doing. - Go back to bed, Alison. - Come on. Would you mind moving aside and letting us through? In case you haven't realized, Ali is over 18. That means you can't tell her what to do and you can't make her stay here against her will. Let us through. - Excuse me. - Pete! Jenny! - I want you to listen to me, Alison. Listen to me very closely. You hear my voice. Only my voice. And you know that what I'm about to tell you is the truth. - I don't know what we would've done if Dr. Lyle hadn't been here. It seems he's something of an expert on nerve pressure points. He managed to subdue the young man before any real harm was done. - I think he's waking up. - Where's Ali? - Your name Peter Healey? - Where is she? - You wanna tell us how you come to be on these premises? - Not particularly. - Now don't get smart with me, son. According to Mrs. Finlay, you've broken into the premises and attempted forcibly to abduct a young woman member of the household. - The young woman is a friend of mine, and these people were holding her against her will. I was just trying to help her get away from them! - It's ridiculous, Sergeant. This young man has been pestering my niece day and night since she came here. Apparently he's a former boyfriend, but he refuses to accept the fact that she doesn't want anything more to do with him. - Look, all you have to do is ask Al. She'll tell you what really happened. - I'd rather she wasn't disturbed. - Surprise, surprise. They don't want you to talk to her. I wonder why. - As I was about to say, I'd rather she wasn't disturbed, but it does seem as though it's the only way to settle this matter, so I suggest we get it over with. She's in her room. - Alison. Will you tell the Sergeant as briefly as you can what happened last night? - I woke up and he was standing beside the bed. He threatened to kill me if I didn't go with him. - What? Ali, what's the matter with you? - Have you ever had anything to do with him before tonight? - I went out with him a couple of times. I realized the sort of person he was. He frightened me. I asked him to leave me alone, but he wouldn't. I see, and you've done nothing to give him the impression that you are being held here against your will? That you needed help? - No. - All right. Thank you, miss. I don't think we need trouble you any further. - Oh, now hold on. Look it, can't you see they've done something to her? Look, she's drugged or something. - Outside. - I'm telling you the truth. You wanna see what sort of place this is. Take a look in the old lady's room. See for yourself the sort they've got in there. - Sergeant, my husband's grandmother is a very old lady. A trifle eccentric. She plays with tarot cards and astrology charts, but it's all perfectly harmless. But if you'd like to see for yourself. - No, your niece told me all I need to know. Come on. Just get a few more particulars from you. We'll take him down and charge him. - Yes, certainly. - Sergeant, if you don't need me, I'd like to stay with Alison for awhile. - Yes, of course, Mrs. Finlay. We'll call you when we need you. - Thank you. They're charging him. - Good. - That should put an end to his interfering. - Not necessarily. He'll most likely be out on bail in the morning. We'd better have someone keep an eye on him just in case. - All right. - It's after midnight. It's Wednesday now. Alison's birthday. -So itis. Only a few more hours left to go. You know, Jeremy, Dean and I have become rather fond of Alison. In a way I'm almost sorry. - You surprise me, Jennifer. That kind of sentimentality's extremely inappropriate to someone in your position with your responsibilities. - I didn't- - You know as well as I do she has a destiny and she must fulfill it. Nothing must be allowed to stand in the way. - I know that. - Mirne has been waiting a long time for Alison. Thanks for coming down, bailing me out and everything. - That's okay. But do me a favor. Don't go wandering too far away. I've got quite an investment in you at the moment. - Don't worry. - And sometime when you feel in the mood, you might like to tell me what really happened last night. - Yeah, I will. Thanks again. - Want a lift? - No, I've gotta go and see a friend of mine. Car's just across the road. - Well, keep out of trouble. - I'll try. See you tonight. - Pete! How are ya, Sal? - Wonderful. Oh, what have you been doing? Must be, what, two years? Oh, come on in. It's really terrific to see you. Coffee? - Now to that I would not say no. - Sit down. - I see you're still pretty heavily into things occult. - No, don't take too much notice of the decor. It's just to impress the customers. - The what? - I've gone commercial. I do charts. - With astrology? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. What about all that other stuff you used to be into? Witchcraft, seances and all that? - Oh, no. Got out of that scene when I started to realize just what sort of things I was playing around with. Dangerous games, those. Mmm. - Got a problem, Pete? - Yeah. Something I can help with? - I was kind of hoping. That mean anything to you? - Yeah, I've got a feeling I've seen it somewhere. Offhand I can't remember where. Must be a pretty obscure one or I'd know it. Any clues? - Well, I don't know if there's a connection, but there's a name. Something like Mirne. - Mirne? Yeah, rings a bell. Yeah, Celtic, I think. Yeah, here it is. Mirne. M-I-R-N-E. In ancient Celtic mythology, a powerful female demon, worshiped by Celtic magicians, later by some Druid sects. Said to dwell within stone. Her color blue, her ritual number 19. That's all. Hey, come on. What's this all about? - Wish I knew. If you've got time, I'll tell you the whole story. As much of it as I know. And see if it makes any sense to you. - I agree with you, Pete. I don't like the sound of it. I think you better get your friend out of there. - I tried last night, remember? Didn't get very far. Besides, the way she is now, I doubt if she'd come with me. Somehow they've managed to turn her against me. - From your description, I'd say that's just some form of hypnosis. Probably only temporary. - Hypnosis? I don't think you can hypnotize a person against their will. - You can if you go about it the right way. That's not important. What worries me is, well, let's assume these people are members of some modern-day Mirne worshiping cult. The most important number in all of their ceremonies would be Mirne's ritual number, 19. Look at Alison. According to what you've told me, at seven o'clock tonight, which is the 19th hour of the day, she'll be exactly 19 years old. And I wouldn't mind betting it goes further than that. The ancient Celtic magicians had a complex star calendar as the basis for their ceremonies. Looking on that calendar, today is the 19th day of their year. So you see, to them Alison would be a very special person. And tonight, a very special night. What are you gonna do? - Get her out of there. I'll bring a shotgun if I have to. - Well, hold on. Before you do that, let's find out everything we can about them and about Alison. What do you know about her background, her real parents? - Nothing. I don't think she knows much about them herself. - One thing we do know about her birth is the time of it. How about checking newspaper files for the days immediately following? If there's a birth notice, there's the name of the parents, maybe an address. - How is that gonna help? - Maybe it won't, but it's worth a look. While you're doing that, I'll check through everything in the house, see if I can find out anything about the Mirne cults surviving into modern times. - Okay, I'll get back to you. Sal? Thanks. - Oh, I'm sorry. We can't give out that sort of information. Not without authorization. - Whose authorization? - The person concerned. In this case, Ms. Baker or her parents. - Look, her parents were killed nearly 20 years ago in a car accident. And Ms. Baker, well, if she's who I think she is, well, she's a friend of mine. That's what I want to find out. Whether she really is the same person. - Well, I'm sorry. - Okay, look. If I give you a description of my friend and you check it against your records, all you'll have to do is say yes or no. You won't be giving me any information I don't already have. Please? - All right, describe her. - Um, she's got brown hair and hazel eyes. - Don't know much about babies, do you? They're all born with blue eyes and hair coloring usually changes after the first couple of months. - What else is there? - You tell me. - She's sort of got a red mark in the middle of her back, but I don't know if, I forgot the most obvious thing. The girl I'm looking for was born at exactly 7:00pm. - Check. - Look, um, suppose a person or a group of people wanted to get hold of a baby that was born at a specific time. Well, how would they go about it? - By get a hold, do you mean steal? - Yeah. - Well, for starters they'd need to have someone working on the inside. Someone with access to records of all the hospitals in the area, and access to maternity wards. - Uh-huh. Like a doctor. Hello? Yes, he's here. Jeremy, it's for you. Michael. - Well, what's happening? He spent an hour going through old newspaper files. Now he's at the hospital asking questions. - I see. Very well, he's had his chance, and we're at the stage now where we can't afford to risk any further interference. Kill him. - All right. I'll call the others. - Hold him. - Just before you do that, there's something I think you oughta know. - Oh? - I know all about Alison. Your doctor allowed taking her from the hospital because she happened to be born at exactly the right time. And you killed her real parents to avoid any complications later. - You've obviously done your homework, which, of course, is the reason you have to die. - Something else I know, too. Something I found from hospital records. Lyle took the wrong baby. - That's impossible. - Alison Baker was born at 70 minutes past seven. The one that was born at your magic seven o'clock was the daughter of another couple named Bleaker. Lyle obviously got the names mixed up because of their similarity. At any rate, he took Alison and left the one you really wanted behind. - You don't expect us to believe that? - I can prove it. Get these swamp zombies off me and I'll show you. Back! Back or I'll kill him! - Don't worry about me! Get him! - Keys! - Forget it. You won't catch him now. Let me see those. Copy of a police record of interview. Something he had in his pocket. - Then he was lying about Alison being the wrong one. - Of course. - What if he goes to the police? - I doubt that he will after last night, but if he does we'll simply refuse to let them into the house without a search warrant. By the time they get one, the ceremony will be over. And after that, it hardly matters what happens. No, there's nothing he can do to stop us now. - Sally Brown. It's Pete. - Oh, I just about given you up. Where are you? - I'm on my way over to get Ali out of that place. I just thought I'd check with you first. Glad you did. I've come up with something. I think you should know about it before you go out there. - What is it? - Look, Pete. I don't know how seriously you take these things. Black magic, summoning up demons, all that. - That's something I'd have to think about, love. And right now there isn't the time. What matters is the Finlays and their friends take it seriously. Enough to try and kill me and do god knows what to Ali, so whatever it is, let's hear it. - Okay. The Mirne cult was revived in the early 17th century by a Somerset farm girl called Isobel Thorne. She and her followers used to conduct sabbaths in the ruins of an old druid extern circle, envoking Mirne, inviting her to take possession of Isobel's body. And according to the story, that's what eventually happened. - Thorne. Well, that's the name of the old lady, the one that's supposed to be Ali's great-grandmother. - That would be right. The story goes that the demonesque completely took over the original Isobel Thorne, and stayed in possession of the body until she was an old woman. Then, with the help of her followers, she transferred to the body of another young girl. When she got too old, well, they just kept repeating the process every 80 years or so, and always when a young girl was possessed by Mirne, they renamed her Isobel Thorne. - You're saying that the old lady in that house is possessed by some ancient Celtic demon. - I'm saying that that's what these people believe. - But what are they doing here, for god's sake? This is hardly 17th century Somerset. - Apparently the last time they held a sabbath, the locals got wind of what was happening. They still have their own way of dealing with witches in those parts. Well, they arrived just as the ceremony was finishing. They killed the old woman, but the young girl and a few members of the covenant escaped, disappeared completely. The theory is that they left the country. And ended up here. I see. - Well, that incident was fairly well documented, by the way. It happened 84 years ago, and the girl was exactly 19 years old. That makes her a 103 now, and from what you've told me, that's the same age as Alison's great-grandmother. - Yeah, except that she's not really related to Ali. None of them are. They kidnapped her from the hospital when she was just a baby. - That's the way they've always done it. A baby born at the right time, stolen from the cradle and brought up by members of the covenant. - And that's what this is all about. They've got Ali picked out to be the next Isobel Thorne. - You better get going. There isn't much time. Yeah, I'll see you later, Sal, I hope. - Pete? Yeah? - Look, just in case what's going on out there is the real thing, take some protection with you. - I am. I've got one of the old man's target pistols. - That's not the sort of protection I meant. - Well, what then? - An old standby, but still pretty effective. A cross, preferably a consecrated one. - Okay. See you. - Alison. Alison, dear. Wake up. - Come along, dear. It's time for the party. Everyone's waiting. - Well, I feel rotten. I don't know what's wrong with me. - You'll feel better once you're on your feet. Here, let me help you. There, is that better? - Hang on. I can't go down there like this. - Nonsense, dear. Everyone knows you haven't been feeling very well. - You're kidding. I must look terrible. - No, dear, you look very pretty. Now, come along. - Is Pete here? - No, he telephoned to say he couldn't come. - But he promised. - He might come over later. Now come along. We don't want to keep everyone waiting, do we? Where are we going? - Oh, this is Grandmother Thorne's room. She's still not well enough to get out of bed, so we're having everyone in to say hello to her before the party starts. - Alison. One. Two. Three. Prepare her. Drink, Alison. Let's begin. Let the way be opened. Let the link be formed. - Down the backyard there's this place, a kind of stone circle. Come on, open the door or we'll smash it down. Mirne. Mirne. Hear me, mistress of the night. Come forth and be reborn in the body of the child. She is yours. She awaits you. Come forth and possess her. Come forth! Possess her! Possess her! - Ali! Get back! Get away from her! Come on! Move! Ali, wake up! Come on, we've gotta get out of here! Ali! - The cross! Throw it at them! Throw it at them! - Come on! Uh! Ah! It's no good, Ali. I've wrecked my ankle. Here, take this. Get away! Go on, Ali! Get going! - You're a fool to throw away the cross. If you hadn't, I might still be Alison. But you did. And I'm not. - No. Light blue 10. John Street, \Waterloo. - Well, I don't think we need to trouble you any further this evening. We've talked to your guests and they're all in agreement about what happened. The deceased crashed the party, attempted to abduct the young lady at gunpoint. He fell, twisting his ankle. The gun discharged accidentally, inflicting a fatal chest wound. There's a few formalities, of course. I think they can wait till the morning. For the moment, I think the most important thing is for the young lady to get some rest. I can imagine what a shock this has all been for her. - Yeah, especially seeing as he already tried it last night. Bloke was obviously off his nut. - Yes, I'm afraid you're right. It's just terrible that something like this had to happen on Alison's birthday. We were looking forward to it so much. - Yeah, well, um, goodnight. Sir, Mrs. Finlay. - Goodnight. - I'll see you out. - Ah. I feel so dizzy. I guess I must've passed out again. - Yes, you did. - I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. Is it time for the party yet? - We've called off the party. The doctor said you're not well enough. - Well, I guess I oughta be leaving soon then. Pete and I have to be back at work on Monday. - I'm afraid not, dear. You're going to be staying here with us. Peter won't be coming round anymore. - He won't? I don't understand. Uh! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah!
