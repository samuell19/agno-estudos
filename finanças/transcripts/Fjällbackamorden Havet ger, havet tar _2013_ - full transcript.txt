Let go of me! Stop it, Bosse! Let go of me! I give in! Help! Bosse, where are you? Bosse! THE FJALLBACKA MURDERS ''The Sea Gives, The Sea Takes Away'' Flash! Don't move! The photo will make a good present for your mum. Hello? Yeah, but...sure. Bye. I'm needed at the station. - Take care of Mummy! A big kiss! - Bye! - Bye! There! You just use the old technology? Oh yes, I'm like an old dog. Digital is nothing for me. Your photos are fantastic, Stigge. - What a record of life on Fjallbacka! - Perhaps. Ingrid Bergman. She came out to Fjallbacka every summer until she died in 1982. Haven't you ever considered putting out a book of photos on Fjallbacka? No, no one's ever asked me. I am now. Do you have some photos I could show my publisher? Yes, maybe. - Let's see here... - Great! I'll ring her right now. Hi, this is Erica Falck. Is Susanna there? Hello? Hi, Susanna. It's me. Sorry to bother you, but I've got the best idea for you! How about a book of amazing photos from Fjallbacka? And I'd write the foreword. The photographer is right here. Yes. Yes. I'll ring you back. Bye. Anton! Anton! Anton! Anton! Anton! Little fella! You can't run out into the street like that! One of them just needs to back up. They haven't backed up for one another for generations! Strands and Ljungbergs. Strands and Ljungbergs. Is it the lobster feud? Oh yes. Lobsters, boats, love, everything. - Magnus, back up your car. - I don't need your advice, you gimp! Their parents were exactly the same. Magnus's father Bosse was also a fisherman. Just like Tord's father, Otto. They were always at loggerheads with each other. Always. I'll take the photos - See you soon. - Bye. Sofie! The delivery from the bakery. Okay. Someone had parked in front of an exit. So Mellberg called you in for a parking offence? - Did the photo session work out okay? - Yes, finally. Now that I've got your mum's present, I'll take it to her and then I've done my part. - Are those Stigge's? - Yes. I thought I might write some short stories about Fjallbacka. Or love. Love for a beautiful, young girl. A beautiful young girl... Are you in love with a beautiful young girl? - Yes, a relatively young girl. - Relatively! And beautiful. Watch out for the photos! I'll just move them out of the way. Honey! Hello! I'm just going to pass by Stigge's studio first. Do you remember the words to the song? - It'll make her very happy. - What are you going to do? See if Stigge is here. Hi, Patrik. It's me. I'm at Stigge's. You need to come here. On duty. - Well? - Inside there. - Have you called Forensics? - Yes, they're on their way. - How was he...? - Blows to the head. I'll secure the outside, you go... I found him at around 10.37. It looks like someone struck him from behind with that tripod. Maybe we should trade places. So I'm inside here and you're out there. There's blood on it. Our daughter, our girl. - Her name's Maja. She's outside alone. - Sorry. So what do you think? Robbery? No. All his cameras are still here. And a few thousand kronor in his cash register. A birthday present for my mum. Hey, listen... Oh, geez! Forensics are here, so let's give the fellas room to work. - Hi! How's it going? - What's happened? It's about Stigge. Did you know him? - ''Did''? Is he dead? - Yes. Was he murdered or something? I mean...since you're here... You're here early in the morning. Did you see anything? As I was setting out my traps just before six, someone was leaving his studio. And did you see who it was? I just saw her from behind. She seemed rushed to get away. Could you describe her? Well, a rose pink jacket... Tall, short? Oh, pretty normal, I think. I didn't give it much thought. - Did you see anything? - No, I wasn't here. - He obviously had a lie-in. - Where were you? - Am I a suspect because I wasn't here? - It's just a routine question. Good. You bloody idiot! Go to hell! - It's about Stigge, I'm sure. - Yes, exactly. Who was working last night and this morning? - I was. - Just you? Yes. Okay. Did you see anything or anyone unusual out in the harbour? Either last night or this morning? No. A woman was seen leaving the studio just before 6.00 am. Do you know anything about that? No. I was probably preparing breakfast about that time. Well, fine then. Thank you. If you think of anything, get in touch. Bye. Was that the police? What did they say? A woman was seen leaving the studio early this morning. - But not one of us, right? - Ladies! We're going to raise our glasses to whoever it was who killed that bastard! Don't you get it? It's over! - It's over! - To the Unhappy Wives Club! There you go, sweetie! Would you like some cinnamon buns? Do we have some left in the freezer? Remember the ones we baked last week? - They're so yummy! - Hi! Hi there, Grandma's little darling! Hi! - Kristina! What are you doing here? - There's a water leak in my house. So I thought I could stay here with you. With us? The plumber said it'll take a few days and promised to be done by my birthday. - You want to stay with us? - That should be fine, right? No more sweets while Grandma's here! We need to eat less sugar. - Has she at least had some lunch? - No, we haven't had time. Not had time? I found Stigge Ericsson murdered this morning. What? I'm sorry, I... Did you know him very well? No...or rather, yes. Not very well, but we knew each other ever since we were...young. Dad... Dad, it's me. It's Tord. That bloody bastard Ljungberg. I was heading seaward and he was heading landward. I heard that... Stigge is dead. What? Finally. Finally. I forgot to lay out towels and sheets for your mum. I took care of that. She can't sleep if the sheets aren't freshly pressed. Are you okay? I'm angry, I think. It seems so strange. Assaulting Stigge, the most harmless person in the world. I don't really understand it. Me neither. How was Maja when you put her to bed? Okay. I told her what had happened. That Stigge was dead. She knew that. What did she say? That I should catch the person who was mean to Stigge. I agree with her. Catch the person who was mean to Stigge. I promise. According to the coroner, he died between 4.00 and 6.00 am. Twenty blows to the head. Have we written off the robbery theory? Yes. This is no robbery. What should we do about the press? They've started ringing. Let me handle them. You and Paula continue knocking on doors. We need to find something! Our only lead is a woman in a rose pink jacket. What about this? Have you seen this? What is it? Interesting. - Come on. - To what do I owe the honour? - We have a few questions. We've looked a little closer into Stigge Eriksson's financial situation. We discovered that he owned the boathouse where he had his studio. It had belonged to your family previously. Sofie, I don't think they've changed the sheets in no.3. Could you see to that? That's right, I sold it to Stigge. He paid barely a tenth of its true value. - Is it against the law to sell at a low price? - No, but a bit odd perhaps. Not if you're trying to help out a good friend. You give him a good price. Were you two good friends? The truth is, Stigge has been very dear to me. He's one of the people who's been dearest to me and he'll leave a big void in my life. Very big. I'm sorry. Is there anything else I can...? - No, not at the moment. - Of course. - They know! - Just stay calm! Mum! Otto isn't going to survive, so Tord and I will take over the fishing business. Couldn't we convince them to put it all aside... You chose which side you're on. I didn't choose sides, you know that. - We were in love! - Was he? Or was it interesting for him to see you abandon us. Come inside, Mum. - What's this? - Hi! - What is that? - This? We stuck that there to keep people out. I'll return to the station unless you need help with that trespasser. - No, see you later. - Bye. I was just going to take a look around. Something doesn't add up. There's something I've forgotten. Stigge owned this place. He bought it from Anette Djurholm. Far too cheaply. She's never sold anything cheaply in her whole life. They were good friends. She said. Improbable friends in that case. He had tons of cameras! This was full of negatives. This is where Stigge kept the photos he gave me. This was full of negatives. Are they what the murderer wanted? So that's her. Ingrid Bergman. Thank you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Her kids come out here, for Mrs. Bergman's birthday. She has one daughter with her first husband. And three kids with Roberto Rossellini. The director. He's really jealous about her getting marrying again. She really knows what love is! She's been loved! - You've no business here! - These waters are free! Then fish off Stora Angeln or anywhere else. Porsholmen has always been mine! - You can lay your traps somewhere else. - Otto! Uh oh, Stigge's with your girl! If you can keep your eye on them. No... Why doesn't he jump in and fetch it? Can't he swim? Excuse me, Erica, this may be none of my business, but... shouldn't you stop meddling in Patrik's work? What? These photos belong to Patrik's investigation. - You're a writer... - You're right, it's none of your business! I beg your pardon. The photos are for a book. I was helping Stigge with a book. Oh, then... I'm the one who owes you an apology. I'm sorry. Birgitta Lallert. She worked for Ingrid Bergman. When she was here. We were all very, very jealous of her. She was in a lot of these photos. She must've meant very much to Stigge. No one saw that coming that autumn. What? Birgitta was dating the best-looking guy in the village, Otto Strand. Are you here to watch us or the movie? Eyes forward, you idiot! Aren't you getting any yourself? Huh? Are you a peeper? Everyone thought that they'd marry. But she chose Stigge in the end. Everyone was amazed, Stigge was certainly no catch. Especially in comparison to Otto. - Were they together long? - I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. Last I knew, she was living on Dannholmen. That was ten years ago. I thought I'd fetch the kids, so I can see what their day-care centre is like. May I use your boat, Janne? - Sure, but it's low on fuel. - I'm not going far. - Hello? - Hi, it's Kristina. Hi, how are the kids? Just fine. - Don't lie in the doorway! - I'll be home as fast as I can. - No problem. I just wanted to tell you... On our way home your daughter used a word that I won't repeat. It's spelled S-H-I-T! I'm a bit surprised that you, a writer, allow your kids to use such language. If Maja starts smoking and swearing, I'll certainly put a stop to it. Please don't take it as criticism again, I was just trying... I'm kind of busy right now! - Oh really? - Hang on. - Hello? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh shit! -Erica! No! Eri... - Do you need help? - Hi! - Yes, please! - Okay. You haven't chosen an easy job. My grandfather and my father were both fishermen, it's not something I chose. My grandfather was a fisherman, too. He died at sea. So did my grandfather and my father. - Couldn't they swim either? - No, nobody could back then. No. Stigge didn't come to such a happy end either. No, it's terrible. What the hell? Hey, listen! Move your traps somewhere else! Porsholmen is mine! Calm down! You know what I mean! Our lines will get tangled up! That's bullshit! These waters are free! That ba... What are you doing? Keep them away from here! Sorry about that. Those Strands are crazy. She must be running an errand. Yes, definitely. Mum, we're kind of busy here. I'll be home in a while. Good. Bye. My mum's staying with us this week, so it's kind of... - Are those papers from the studio? - Yes, I've organised them. - Organised? Into two piles? - Yes. These we've examined, these we haven't yet. Paula, have you asked Johanna about dinner at my place? No, I'm sorry. I haven't had time. There are so many papers I need to go through right now. - Does she still live here? - I don't know. Thanks for the petrol! Birgitta! Birgitta! I was a friend of Stigge's. Birgitta! A neighbour saw the police tape when she was in Fjallbacka. So she found out what had happened. I don't think it's sunk in yet. Stigge said you were interested in his photos. Yes, he was a wonderful photographer. You thought they could be made into a book? He would've liked leaving something behind. They can still be made into a book. We just need to find Stigge's negatives. There are a lot of them missing from the studio. Are you coming or not? I asked Stigge to let me hold onto the Bergman photos. To keep them from ending up in the wrong hands. Come here, I'll show you. Here they are. I worked for her when she was here. This one is beautiful. That one! I had no idea he was taking it! We were together after that, that autumn. I didn't even know that you existed. Stigge spoke so little about himself. We were both very private. Sometimes Stigge lived here with me and... sometimes I slept over in his studio. We were two lone wolves that together made a pack. Let me show you something! Look at this! - Hey, look at this! - What? ''24/11. 2000KL ,10/12. 3000SS ...'' A date, numbers, letters. Pages of them. Stigge's bank statements. We have them! They should be in here. November 24, a deposit of 2,000 kronor. December 10, a deposit of 3,000 . The same dates and sums that are in that book. But KL and SS? Initials of the depositors. Finally something's happening here! See if the bank can tell us who paid in the money. Good! Almost over the edge! Erica! You have some nerve hanging up on me like that! Where've you been anyway? I went to visit Birgitta Lallert. Does Patrik know that? When I spoke with him he said you'd gone to town... I think you knew Stigge a little better than you said. Yes. I dreamed of becoming a model. And Stigge thought that I should... pose... nude. Yes. Stigge promised that he'd burned these. - But he didn't. - No. And I paid for it. - Did he blackmail you? - No, there was no question of that. Hello! - I found a little rascal in the garden! - Not a word about those photos! - It might be important for the case. - He can't see his mother naked! - Hi! - Hi, honey! - Hi! - Hi there! So here you are. Everyone thought Stigge was the greatest person in the world. We did say that maybe he wasn't as innocent as he appeared. What are you getting at? That perhaps he had some secrets. That's what we were talking about. That's for sure. We found payments from a number of people and none of them were in his account books. Negatives that have vanished, secret payments, it sounds like blackmail. That's what we're looking into right now. Otto? Hi! Are you awake? Yes. Do you want me to ring your son? No. Should I ring someone else? Yes. Yes, no. You can't do that! Sit back down! This comes as a very ugly surprise, this conversation. I'm very disappointed. I don't ever intend to use you again! Bye! The plumbing firm said it'll take longer to dry up the water damage than they'd promised me, so there'll be no party. - Yes, of course there'll be! - No, there will be no party. - Couldn't...? - No, I don't want to. Please. Well, okay. Mum! - You could always hold your party here! - No, that's out of the question! Yes, Kristina! Of course you should hold your party here! I'll help you! Oh Erica, that's great! This makes me very happy. You and I have a lot of organising to do, you and I. - Hi! Am I disturbing you? - No, no. Weren't you eating with your mum and Mellberg tonight? - You and I have to work late tonight. - We do? Oh right. Then you'll have to work on a boat! I'm going out on a boat tonight. We know Stigge was killed between four and six in the morning. He was struck over twenty times with a tripod. No fingerprints on the tripod. In the studio we found prints from at least thirty persons. Just before six, a woman was seen leaving his studio in a rose pink jacket. Seen by Tord Strand. In this notebook we've found nearly fifty different initials. - People who paid Stigge money. - For at least 20 years. ML - Magnus Ljungberg. Or Mimmi Larsson. AD - Anette Djurholm. Let's do this calmly and methodically. The bank is getting us a list of the depositors. So if Stigge was blackmailing people... - ...up to 50 people... - ...had a motive to kill him. Half of Fjallbacka! Well? What did you want? Magnus, come closer. I need to tell you something. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm just asking... Never let it happen again. It's too late. Stigge! Stigge! It's Otto! I want to talk to you! Where are you? Stigge! Why didn't you say anything? - What's this room for? - Nothing. Stay away from Birgitta. You have no business seeing her, you understand? Good. What the hell...? What are those? What is this? When did you take these? Well? You've been spying on us! - No! - You perverted bastard! Stigge! - What happened? - I fell down. You'll recover completely, won't you? We're engaged! I'm so happy! I never dreamed a person could be this happy! Otto will buy a nicer one when he gets the money, after lobster season's over. I have to run. Take care of yourself! She sold the boathouse to Stigge for next to nothing. What? She was obviously being blackmailed. - Who? - Anette. Djurholm. What time is it anyway? - Sorry, I'm having trouble sleeping. - Try not to think out loud like that. Sorry. Thank you for coming in. We haven't found any family. No siblings, children, or other relatives. Stigge had me. I was his family. What are you doing to catch the killer? We're just in the preliminary phase of this investigation... You don't know what you're talking about, do you? Not even you believe you do. We're going through his accounting records. Could he have kept them somewhere else in his studio? - Not as far as I know. - There's nothing at your place? - No bank vault? - No. - Would you like some? - No, thank you. Tord! Tord! Otto is dead. He passed in his sleep. No... Hi! My mother-in-law's birthday is coming up and she has a water leak so she wants to have her party at our house. I was thinking about catering it. Sorry, I'm babbling away! I'm Erica Falck. I know. Fjallbacka's celebrity. Anette. - Could you give me two seconds? - Of course. Where were we? Mothers-in-law, one of the trials of being married. That's right. - Are you married? - Oh yeah. - It would be hard to run this alone. - No, Malcolm isn't involved in this hotel. No, he's always on the road. Wine imports. Yeah! May I ask you a question? Yes? Was Stigge Ericsson blackmailing you? You're married for an eternity. You forget to give one another that special attention. Could you do that a little later? After a while... you start yearning. You met another man. I own a hotel. I met a lot of other men! Then Stigge came along with his photos. Yes. Stigge kept those photos in a safe place which was safe as long as I paid, which I did, month after month. - And he wasn't satisfied? - He was never satisfied. In the end we made a trade. I got my negatives and he got my boathouse at a ridiculous price. Maybe I should tell all this to the police? Yes. Do you think I could get my boathouse back? The money and... Do you? You'll have to ask Patrik. Excuse me, where's Otto Strand's room? - Are you family? - No, we're very old friends. I'm very sorry, he passed away today. I want the ring back. - What? - Give me the ring! What...? I heard about what happened. Birgitta, I love you. And I always have. - Here. - Thank you. So why did you want to see my jacket? Where were you that morning, between 4.00 and 6.00 ? Oh, that's right. My husband was in Marseilles on business, so I was at a girlfriend's house. We sat talking and drinking wine. Faustino, worth every krona! It was a late night, so I slept over, on the sofa. - Who was the friend? - Sofie Bergmark. - She's here, if you want a word with her. - That would be great. Just follow me! My husband's a lorry driver, he was away, and still is. He's gone a week at a time. Anette came over. We talked, drank some wine. Faustino, worth its price. It got late, so Anette slept over. Fine. Thanks a lot. - They'd coordinated that. - It sure sounded like it. - Hi! Won't this be fun! - Oh, that's right! - Your mum and I are going out. - That'll be fun. - Bye! - Bye! What's wrong? The photos. The police will find out and then everyone will know. - Anette's going to... - What about Anette? Anette said we should stay calm, but I'm not. I'm not calm. - I'm not sure about that shade of blue. - How about champagne? - It is for your 65th birthday. - How long will it take to order it? - A week. - That's too long... Erica...? Erica, where are you going? Erica! Erica! - Where are you going? - Give me your keys? What are you doing, Erica? - What are you doing? - Get out of the car! - No way! - Then you have to shut up. - Take it easy, this car's 20 years old. - It's time to trade it in! I don't understand what we're doing. The morning Stigge was killed a woman was seen leaving his studio in a rose pink jacket like the one the woman in the car ahead of us has on. -So she may be the killer? - We don't know. ''We''? The police don't know, Erica! You aren't the police! No, but I'm a nice daughter-in-law who knows secrets about her mother-in-law. - You can stay here. No. - I can't leave you alone with a murderer. - A possible murderer. There's the jacket. Oh, what a pretty jacket! Who could it belong to? It's mine. - Kristina! - Hi. - Hi, I'm Kristina Hedstrom. - Hello. Pia Strand. - I remember your wedding. - Could you hang up our jackets? Sorry. In-laws. My father-in-law just passed away. Oh, I'm sorry, How thoughtless of me. - May I sit down? - Yes. Tord is a Strand, I was born Ljungberg. - The lobster feud. - Yes. My dad drowned when my mum was pregnant with me. And my brother Magnus was just five years old. So we became a tight family, it was us against the world. And against the Strands. That's just how it was, I don't know why. Tord and I, we... we were inseparable. And I got pregnant and we married. And your family refused to come to your wedding. Yes. It's difficult to choose between your family and the person you love. And you chose love. If that's what it was. I'm supposed to meet Tord at the undertaker's. Excuse me, I'm looking for a present for a friend. Where did you get your jacket? I don't know. It's just one I borrowed from a work colleague, Sofie. - Sofie at the hotel? - Yes. It was good talking to you. Lists from the bank of deposits into Stigge's account. Give it to me! Where should we start? Sofie Bergmark? Anette Djurholm's alibi. She was being blackmailed, too. Hello! Patrik! Out there! You take my mum on a car chase. - No, we were just following Pia. - And then to a murder scene! I didn't know she was dead. Stigge was a friend, but not the person I thought he was! I know all that! I need to know what happened! Why were you doing in the kitchen? - Where are you going? - I don't want to talk to you. - I could've shot you! - You'll wake the kids! Honey, Kristina and I are both fine. Honey... Patrik... - I love you so much. - I love you, too. Did you learn anything more? No, no one had seen anything. We questioned everyone in the hotel. Except Anette, who was in shock. She gave Anette the alibi for Stigge's murder. Yes. You connected well with her, didn't you? Yes. Why? Oh, Sofie... Anette... Did Stigge have photos of Sofie with a man who wasn't her husband? Was he blackmailing her? Who was Sofie seeing? I don't know. I don't know anything any longer. I just know that... Sofie had trouble making the last payment to Stigge. But you and Sofie confided nearly everything in one another, didn't you? Sofie and me? Good God, we were best friends. A woman in a rose pink jacket was seen outside Stigge's the morning he died. Sofie had a rose pink jacket. - It doesn't matter any longer. - What doesn't? She told me what happened that morning. She was going to plead with Stigge, because she didn't have the money. He was already dead when she arrived. - She saw someone. - Who? - You have to tell me what you know. - She'll never forgive me. Who did she see? Sofie...saw Pia's brother. Magnus Ljungberg. Yes. Oh no. That's for sure. Thank you, Annica. Martin Ljungberg paid 750,000 kronor to Stigge in the last five years. - He had something to hide. - We'll bring him in. Hi! They've arrested a suspect. Erica, I think I've discovered something important. This is the contact sheet we got from Birgitta Lallert. The whole roll is of me, except for these last three photos. Bosse Ljungberg, the same day he vanished at sea. - Pia and Magnus's father? - Yes. Are you going to Dannholmen? Maybe you can sell some lobsters out there. No, I'm going home to dinner. I'll bet you can sell your whole catch! How much do you bet? So Stigge took these photos just before Bosse vanished? So Bosse's death wasn't an accident. So maybe Stigge took photos of it? Birgitta has the next contact sheet. Yes! It was my discovery! We found this bill of debt among Stigge's papers. You borrowed 750,000 kronor from him! 750,000 kronor! What was it for? None of your business. Answer the question. I paid back every ore, just look through his bank papers. I had no reason whatsoever to kill Stigge. Except that he lent to you at an extortionate rate. It's a good enough motive. Sofie Bergmark saw you in the studio. You weren't in the harbour that morning. You killed Stigge, and then you killed Sofie to silence her! Okay, okay, I was there. But Stigge was already dead when I arrived. I had to step over his body. I'd paid back every ore, but he refused to give me the bill of debt! Someone else was there when I arrived. But I had no idea that it was Sofie. I couldn't find the paper and left. I didn't kill Stigge! So you had nothing to do with his murder? No! Birgitta! Birgitta! Erica! The window! - Birgitta! - Maybe we should wait for Patrik. Nah! Jump inside! - Me? - Yes! Jump in! Birgitta! Did you find anything? Erica? Erica, have you found anything? Erica! Erica! No... Oh.... Oh... - Birgitta, what happened? - Ow! They took the photos. - Who? - I couldn't see who it was. Erica! Erica! Give me that! - Here... what is it? - Sofie. With a man. Not just any man. Bad luck! Did you use all the petrol for the fire? Hi, Erica! I don't believe it... I was out on my boat and I ran out of fuel... - Sorry, what did you say? - Don't even try. You wanted to burn these, didn't you? You thought you and Sofie were best friends. And both of them were just laughing behind your back. Stigge! Was he sending photos to you? - You cheat on your husband with mine! - Malcolm and I love one another. Your fingerprints will be on that knife. - How can I convince you to release me? - Tell the truth. In that case I want to report a murder. - A new murder? - No, an old one. A fifty-year-old murder. Tell us about it. Okay. - Otto Strand asked me to come. - Come closer. He started telling me the story of how my father drowned. There was a big party on Dannholmen. My dad and Stigge went there together. Listen! They're playing jazz! There! Come on! I'll be right there! Here comes that lunatic, too. Hi! Does Mrs. Bergman need lobsters for her party? She already ordered them from Otto. You better watch yourself! Hi. What the hell! - Otto, that bastard! - What's wrong? He cut the fuel hose! He's crazy! I know. Someone should teach him a lesson. - I know! Wait here, Stigge. - Where are you going? I'm going to make him pay. It would be better to wait here. Why are you still here? - Where's Bosse? - He said he was getting revenge. Getting revenge? Bosse, what are you...? Are you sabotaging my lobster traps? - You sabotaged my engine! - What are you talking about! Let go of me! Cut it out, Bosse! I give in! I give in, let go of me! Did you fall for that? - Help! - You're all on your own! You're going to pay for this, Bosse! Did you hear, Bosse? Bosse? Bosse! Bosse! - Patrik, telephone! - Not now! Yes now, it's important! We're on our way back from Dannholmen now. Anette has admitted murdering Sofie. She did it. I'll tell you more later. I'll meet you in the harbour. Bye. A murderer and a blackmailer. Patrik! - Here! - Press conference, 7.00 pm tonight. You should be there. I'll say that we've solved the two murders and that the murderer's in custody. Then you tell about the investigation. No. Anette murdered Sofie, but not Stigge. - What? - Give me that folder on top. These photos show Bosse Ljungberg drowning. Stigge took them. He knew the whole time. Stigge's murderer is in the harbour. Tord, what are you doing? - Tord, stop it! - Don't think you can get away with it! - Stop it! - You family of murderers! Stop it, both of you! I said stop it! I'm so sick of this! That's enough, I said! Pia, take it easy! Tord... What have you done? I didn't know what had happened. My dad... Your dad? Your father died in 1961 . Yes. He drowned. He died in a fight with my dad. Stigge asked me to come over in the middle of the night, he... He told me the whole story. If one knows what one wants, one can buy it. It was your dad who made me a ''gimp''. He's had to pay for it. He had to give me the love of his life. Didn't I tell you to stay away from Birgitta? I have something to show you. And there are more. What do you want? - I have no money. - I want Birgitta. Are you going to kill me, too? What would she say if she saw those photos? Where've you been? I was looking for you. I've never loved you. I want the ring back. I got what I wanted and it wasn't much. Give me the ring. You're evil. Pia had expected more from you, she had to seek solace in others so she could stand waking up next to you every morning. There are photos of that, too, if you want to see them. - And Stigge blackmailed you? - Yes. I paid. I was so scared of losing you. And I didn't want to lose you either. - I didn't want to. - I know.
