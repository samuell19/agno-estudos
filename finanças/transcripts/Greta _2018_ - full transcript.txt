Subtitles by explosiveskull Here I have your... Hello? So, how was the job? It was fine, you know, until I figure out... What to do with your life? No one ever does. Okay, what the hell is that? I found it on the train. I'm just gonna drop it off tomorrow. Oh, you're gonna... you're gonna drop it off tomorrow? - Are you insane? - No, Erica. Where I come from, that's what we do. Okay, this is Manhattan. You find a bag, you call bomb squad. Don't open that. Gross. A lottery ticket, weird-looking pills. "Greta Hideg." Let's see. - No. Uh-uh. - Oh, here we go. Yes. A spa day. Or... we could do a colonic. Come on, it'll be fun. - Will it be? - Yeah. They jet asparagus juice up your ass. And it's not just about cleansing your body; it's also very good for short-term memory. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Jason Largo was dyslexic, and since he's been doing them, now he can say the alphabet backwards. Look, we're not taking her money, number one, and number two, I don't want asparagus juice shot up my butt under any circumstance. Never say never. Have you called your dad yet? Do I have to? Just don't want him to think I'm not giving you the messages. Yeah, I know. I'll call him. Hey. Come on. Movie hasn't even started yet. I know. It's just... It was our thing, you know? Some crappy movie, just... Mom and I. Come on, Frankie. Let's get you home. You could always give me your mom. Ha! Please take her. Thank you. Who is this? Oh, uh, it's Frances McCullen. I have a bag that I found that I think belongs to a Greta Hideg. Oh, uh, hi. Here you go. Oh, bless your heart. I've been looking everywhere. - Where did you find it? - Uh, on the subway. Oh, darling, you brought it all the way in this rain. Will you like a... a cup of coffee? It's already on the pot. It-it would mean a lot to me. You've been so kind. Yeah, sure. Why not? You can put your umbrella here. Okay. Thank you. Are you from New York? Uh, no, I'm actually from Boston, but I'm living here with a friend. Thank you. Boyfriend? No, my roommate from Smith. Her dad bought her a loft in Tribeca for graduation, so we're breaking it in. Oh, that must be tough. The neighbors. I'm sorry. Remodeling. A little courtesy, please! A little quiet! Thank you! I swear they are building an ark. Is this your husband? Yes. Christof. - When he was young. - Mm. And is that your daughter? Yes. Nicola. He taught me how to play. My husband. Liszt was his favorite. Then he began fluffing the notes. His left hand. He thought it was arthritis. Six months later, he was gone. They are with you, and then they are gone. The ones we love. "Liebestraum." Do you know what it means? A dream of love. Because that's all love leaves us with. A dream. A memory. I'm sorry. It's my only company these days. Is that your dog? Oh, yes. Jojo. Long gone as well. Well, have you considered getting another? Oh, no, I couldn't. I wouldn't know how to choose. Well, I could help you. If you wanted. - Are you a dog person? - A little bit. My mom actually used to breed them. Thank you, sweetheart, but I don't think I could manage a dog right now. I hope you are not offended. Not at all. But if you change your mind, just, uh, let me know. Do I have your phone number? No. I never know how to work these things. Here, let me help you. It was actually a really spiritual experience. They cleanse your soul, not just your butt, to the sound of shamanic singing bowls and pan flutes. Please be kidding. - You should come with me next time. - Nope. - I ordered takeout. - Wait. - While they were up your...? - No, God! Gross. For now, for dinner. Oh. Oh, thank God. I'm starving. Yeah, apartment 4B. Uh, Greta? Oh. Hey. Sorry to bother you, sweetheart. Am I calling at a bad time? No, no, not at all. How are you? I've been thinking about what you said about the dog, and... I thought, if you wouldn't mind coming, it... it might not be such a bad idea after all. Yeah, of course. When, uh... when do you want to go? Saturday morning? Is 10:00 too early? Uh, no, 10:00's fine. I'll see you then. Did I just snort crystal meth, or did you just offer to go dog shopping with an old lady? I know. This city is gonna eat you alive. So, how long do you keep them here? - Five days. - And then? If nobody claims their dogs, they're PTS. - PTS? - Put to sleep. Oh. What a dreadful euphemism. And so, which of these is next for the... PTS treatment? Um... This is Morton. Today is Morton's last day. Oh. - May I come in? - Mm-hmm. Come on. Come on, Morton. You don't want to end up a euphemism, do you? Morton... I'm taking you home. Smile. Great. Oh, goodness. I had no idea it could do this. I know. The, uh, wonders of technology, huh? Oh, um, if you want to send it to your daughter, it's actually pretty easy. You just click this, and then share. Oh. You're close to your mother, I can tell. Mm. She actually passed away. Last year. Oh, Frances. Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? It's like you said. I'm left with this... this dream of her, and I don't want her to fade. It won't. If you keep it... here. In your heart. It's okay to light a candle, even if you don't really... practice. I'm sure it is. Christof used to play the organ here. Every Friday. Today's a Friday. I know. For the ones that are gone. Yes? Nothing has changed. Still the same racket from the window. Listen. Love you, too. Ciao. - Nicola, she used to go here. - Mm. The youngest-ever winner of the Little Mozart. And where is she now? Paris. I would have loved Juilliard for her. Mm, uh, still, the Conservatoire de Paris is not to be... How-how do you say that? Sneezed at? Uh, you must miss her terribly. Oh, I get by. One way or another. You don't have to be lonely. Oh, my dear. Even you'll be gone soon. You know, my friends say, uh... I'm like chewing gum. Chewing gum? I tend to stick around. You promise? I promise. So, remember Simon Porter? Uh... Um... Chin fuzz, sideburns, dad works at The New York Times? No, absolutely no clue. Okay, well, he remembers you. He's having a party tonight, and we're going. I am wearing these. - What, are they bad? - No, they're great. They're disgusting. You want to puke. Erica, they're perfect, okay? I just can't go. I already made plans with, uh, Greta to have dinner. Seriously? You'd rather have dinner with Cruella than your friends? That's mean. And they're not my friends. Hey. I am. Well, I'm sorry, but I made these plans last week, so... Come on. Please. I'll call her. - Do you want me to call her? - Erica, I can't go. I have to be there in, like, 30 minutes, so no. What? What? I wasn't gonna say anything, but this is just... it's getting weird. You, like, totally adopted this woman. She's my friend. You hardly know her. Okay, I'm gonna call her. That's it. And we're putting her on a serious taper, - starting tomorrow. - No, Erica. What the hell? Why do you always think that you can just tell me what to do? Right, I'm just some superficial bitch. But I don't see how making some random lady your surrogate mom is normal. - Excuse me? - You're gonna pretend that that's not what's going on here? It's so obvious, it's sad. She's not your mother. I'm gonna try and forget that you just said that to me. Careful. It's hot. Mmm. That's delicious. Soupe de poisson. - And the risotto? - Ah. Courgette and basil. A recipe my mother taught me. - Mmm. - Is it good? Delicious. Hmm? Where are the candles? Uh, in the cabinet... the little cabinet. Okay. Hmm. Did you find them? Yeah, I found them. Mmm, wonderful. I wish I had met your mother. It's good, no? It's delicious. So, tell me about your friend. Uh, this friend of yours... um, Erica is her name, no? What's wrong? You seem upset. I'm really not feeling well. Oh, dear. Are you sick? Maybe. I don't know, it just kind of came over me. Would you like to lay down? No, I think I should just go home. We haven't had dessert. That's okay. Uh, I'll pack you a-a plate, if you want. No, no, it's-it's totally fine. - It's no bother. - Greta, really, it's fine. Are you sure? It will just take a moment. I'm sure. Is there anything I can do? Tell me where it hurts. I just need to go home. Use the key. In the bowl. - Oh, my God. - I know. I mean, I guess she's been, what, purposely planting them around the city? Just hoping someone brings them back to her? - And you did. - Yeah, I did. That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard. Here you go. Table five. Hurry up. Hey, she's really freaking me out. Yeah, tell me about it. - She called there, too? - Only, like, 80 times. I had to unplug the phone. Oh, my God, I just want her to go away. Yeah, well, unfortunately, it's not that easy, especially if they don't want to go. And do you want to know the kicker? What's the kicker? The crazier they are, the harder they cling. Don't tell me that. Then I also won't tell you that I tried - to warn you about her. - I know. Goddamn it, why didn't I just listen to you? You never do. Well, from now on, I swear to God, I'll do whatever you tell me to do. There's somebody asking for you. - Who? - A woman. Oh, my God, Erica, I think she's here. - Shit. - I'll call you later. Can you get rid of her? I tried. She said she needed to see you. I don't want to talk to her. - Look, Francine... - It's Frances. I'm not your public relations manager, understand? Just get rid of her. And I don't want a scene. Greta, what are you doing here? I was worried. You didn't answer your phone. - I left you some messages. - I got them. - What do you want? - Sweetheart, I... - Don't. - What? Don't call me that. What's wrong? What is it? - Ma chérie... - Stop calling me that. Tell me what's wrong. Come on, Greta. I saw them. The bags in the closet, Greta. I saw them. What, you go... you go planting them around, hoping some lost soul's gonna bring them back to you? Trying to find the biggest sucker in New York City? Well, congratulations. You found her. - Frances. - God, you're good. You're really, really good. You totally had me. Thank God I opened the wrong closet door. - Will you let me explain? - No, I won't let you explain. Because it's over. And I never want to see you again. Frances, please. Do not come back here. Frances? If you would only let me explain. What I did was wrong. I know that now. And it will never happen again. But since Nicola left, I have been in this well of loneliness, this black hole. Maybe it drove me a little mad. We were meant for love, Frances, not this terrible isolation. And if you don't call me, I don't know what I will do. Want to work Saturday, 6:00 to close? Uh, yeah, sure. Ah... - Okay, go. - Sorry. Go, go, go. If those are mine, I'm gonna dry-hump you right here. I wish. Frances McCullen? I can't accept those. White lilies. I'm sorry. Oh! - Uh... uh... - I'm so sorry. Um, did any of it get on you? I will get you a new glass immediately. I'm very, very, very sorry. Uh, uh, I'll be right back with your other glass. Call the cops. This is not a problem? So she can just stand there and stare at me all day, and that's not a problem? Everything's cool? Across the street? Yeah, pretty much. How is that not harassment? Ma'am, technically, she can stand there with a telephoto lens and a tripod and take your picture if she wants to. Public area, her rights are protected. Awesome. Ignore her. She's just looking for attention. The more you give her, the more she'll want back. - Well, that was easy. - Ma'am. I said I was sorry. Please talk to me! I said I was sorry. Just tell me what you want... Please. Jesus! What...? God, what do you... what do you want from me? I want to talk. Then talk to your daughter. I can't. She does not understand. What? - What doesn't she understand? - I'm lonely. Greta, everybody's lonely. That does not mean that you get to follow people around and terrorize them. Everybody needs a friend. - You have your Erica. - No. No, you leave Erica out of this. You said you always stick around like chewing gum. Are you insane? Please. Let's try and start again. I love you. You don't even know me. I tried to talk to you. I tried. But you wouldn't listen. People can't keep doing this to me. Ugh, I can't believe she did this. Harassment restraining order can be applied for in certain circumstances. - Is there any physical assault? - She threw gum in her hair. Chewing gum? A restraining order. How could I apply for one? You file a petitioner's affidavit before the court administrator. Once the filing fee is paid, it's forwarded to the judge for review. The judge may then schedule a hearing. And how long could that take? It's Manhattan. The courts are overcrowded. - How long? - It could take months. Instructions for filing are online. In order to remove a dog from the home, SPCA would need proof of mistreatment, like photos or witness statements. What if I don't have any proof but I'm worried about the dog's safety? You talking about that sweet French lady that you came here with? I'm just frightened. For the dog. I thought you were in Paris. The customer you have called is unavailable to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Hi. This is Frances McCullen. I'm trying to get in contact with Nicola Hideg, Greta Hideg's daughter. Uh, you see, I helped her adopt a dog, and I'm worried. Erica? God. Hello? Hey, where are you? - Where should I be? - Chester's. Oh, crap. I totally flaked. I'm sorry. We're-we're still here. - Come hang out. - No, it's okay. I'm gonna stay in tonight. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just, uh... I'm tired. But I'll-I'll see you when you get back. - Okay. - Bye. Hey, Papa. You haven't called me that in a while. Uh... Sorry. It, uh... it slipped. Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead. Maybe you should. How are you doing? I don't know. Been thinking about maybe going away. Might be good to think some things over. Can I come, too? Just you and me? You're just mad at me because I found a way to move on. Is that what it's called? Did it ever occur to you that your mom might have wanted it that way? Come on. I-I mean, for both of us. So that we could just get on with our lives. Is that supposed to make this better? I'm not a perfect man. Which is fine, except now you're quoting Bill Clinton, so... Look, we've both been through so much. This hasn't been easy on either of us. And I miss her as much as you do. Frances? Dad, I got to call you back. - Right now? - Yeah. I'm sorry. - Frankie? - Erica, Jesus Christ. - What's the matter? - Greta... she's there. She's sending me pictures of you. What? You got to get out of there. Actually, no, no. Don't go alone. Is anybody with you? I've looked around. Nobody's here. - Where are you? - Don't worry. I'm leaving. It was a bore fest anyways. Oh, my God, Erica. No, no, no. She's still following you. She's literally going out the door right now. She can't be. I slipped out the back. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Take a deep breath. Relax, okay? God, this is such bullshit. I mean, she can't do this. I'm gonna go to the cops tomorrow, and I'm gonna - hire an attorney. - Go, Frankie Mac. I mean, it's one thing to harass me, but to threaten my friend, she can... You there? She's still following you. Turn around. - I don't see anyone. - You're-you're... you're in an alleyway, and there's some big billboard behind you, and you're still on the phone. That's right in front of me. Jesus Christ. You have to get out of there. Erica? Hello? Okay, calm down, Frankie. I've gotten out of there. Where are you? I'm taking the goddamn subway. She's right behind you. Turn around. She can't be. You bitch. She's still following you. I don't see her. I'm just gonna take an Uber, okay? A bus just pulled up. I can't believe myself, but I'm getting on. Go. Run. - Erica? - I'm on. - Watch for her. - I will. Okay, we're good. Erica, she's on the bus. What? You need help. Erica, don't talk to her! You're pathetic! Excuse me, I have to get off. Erica, get off the bus. - Okay, I'm off. - Where are you? Uh, I-I don't know. Somewhere on 33rd. Uh, there's a bar up ahead, the Copper House. Copper House. It's a left on 33rd from here. And hurry, please. You sick bitch. Oh, my God! Erica! Erica. Oh, my God. Hi. This chick is seriously disturbed. I do have to admit, though, she takes a good photo. I mean, I look badass. Erica, come on. Hello? Hi. Um, this isn't gonna be easy, but maybe we should meet. Sorry. Frances? Um... yeah. You called me about Nicola? I'm Alexa. Alexa Hammond. Do you want to...? Nicola Hideg is dead. She killed herself four years ago. Uh, I knew her from A.A. I was her addiction counselor, and then her partner for six years. - But, uh, I could nev... - Um... I-I'm sorry, but... what about Paris? - Paris? - Yeah. Greta said that she studied at the... the conservatory there. Nicola had never been to France. Listen, that whole French shtick of Greta's is an affectation, all right? She's from Hungary. You know, Greta... she still pretends to talk to her. On the phone. She's a very ill woman. So, Nicola never studied the piano or anything? She used to play till her knuckles bled. You can't save people. You know, I couldn't save her from... whatever it was that had been done to her. You know, maybe she just couldn't survive the box. The box? I used to think it was a metaphor. You know, the box in which she was confined as a child or whatever. But I came to realize before the end... ...that maybe I was wrong. I was speaking with Erica. Dad. She told me what's been going on. You keep telling me everything is okay. I am okay. I... I'm an adult. So talk to me like I'm an adult. Okay, like an adult. This woman is unstable. You need to cut her off entirely. I already have cut her off. Look, Dad, I'll call you back later. Hi. I'm Frances, and I'll be your waitress for the evening. A Kir Royale and some sparkling water, ma chérie. No, I-I... I'm sorry. I-I can't do this. But I've reserved, my dear. - What do you mean, you can't? - Is there a problem? Yes, this woman has been harassing me. You need to ask her to leave. I'm afraid she has a reservation. What kind of service is this? How can I help you, madam? A Kir Royale and a sparkling water. She has my order. - Want some Valium with that? - Yeah. Wouldn't work. - Is she your stalker? - Yeah. Good luck. I'll start with the crab bisque and a small green salad. - Why are you doing this? - Because we have to talk. I have nothing to say to you. Nothing? After all we've been through together? And the sea bream to follow. - It's palatable? - It's excellent. A glass of something white and dry. The pinot grigio. No. Something French. The Chablis. If you say so. Chérie. - Do not call me that. - Et pourquoi pas? It's what you are: my darling. Ma chérie. Why are you speaking French? - Was she talking Klingon? - Call the cops. - Henri won't like that. - I don't care. Just call them. Your funeral. The Chablis. May I? Mm... A bit like you. Promises a lot, then disappoints. Okay. I deserve better! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. You can't do this to me. To us. - Are you a child? - No, you're the child. You need someone to love. You need a mother to hold you. You lost someone, and you're afraid to love. - We both know it's true. - Don't you dare talk to me about my mother. Darling, don't you understand? She had to die. She had to die for us to meet! Are you out of your mind? You just can't accept it! Look at her! She's full of loss! Of grieving! She's gone, Frances! Just accept it! It's called moving on! Leave me alone! She's gone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I should just try and ignore her, right? And how am I supposed to take precautions when you're not even gonna tell me whether or not she's been released? Oh, my God. You already released her, didn't you? Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take that as a yes. Goddamn it. My dad wants to come pick me up. Okay. Okay? I think you should go. What, just leave? Come away with me, then, if the family thing's too much. We can go to Baja. It's cheap. Yeah, but she'd still be here... the minute we got back. Well, then... guess you'll have to try the slow fade. What's that? You apologize, tell her the problem is you, not her, and that you have to go and deal with your, um, issues. By the time that you're back, she'll have moved on to someone else. So... lie, in other words? Right to her face. I'll take you through it. I'm the master of the slow fade. It's Friday. Greta, I'm sorry. I know you are, dear. You were right. I do care. I've just been so upset about my mom, and I was blaming you. I'm gonna go away tomorrow. Just for a little bit. Think some things over. You've been such a help. A friend when I needed one the most. Everyone needs a friend. But we're more than friends, Frances. We're connected. We're family. I know. And what does every child need? A mother. So we'll meet when you come back? You need packing help? No. You wouldn't lie to me, would you? No. So it's not goodbye, darling. Don't I deserve a hug? Maybe that was goodbye, Morton. Erica? Erica, did you water the plants? Erica isn't here, dear, but thank goodness... I am. It seems you forgot to pack. Now, which shoes would you like to bring? Sir, can you help me? - My niece, she's very ill. - Sure. Sure. I'll grab her. Thank you. I'm going to put you right to bed when we get home. Here we are. Toys for you to play with. Even if you don't deserve them. Telling me one big lie like that. But... we'll have our little holiday here. Hmm? Erica? Shouldn't you be packing? Yeah. Yeah, right. Daddy's here. Is he afraid to come up? I don't know. Maybe. Kind of been on his case a lot lately. Give him a chance. He loves you. Oh, I'm gonna miss you. You okay? I don't know. I love you, but you got to go. - Call me. - I will. - Send pictures, okay? - Okay. What the hell? Oh, my God! Help! Oh, my God! No! No, no! Oh, my God. Help! Please. Oh, my God! No! No! Help me! What? Help me! Please. No! Please let me out! Please let me go. No, no. No! Please, somebody help me! This is the bed of lies. You were not even packed. You were not going anywhere, were you? Please. Just trying to get rid of Greta. Please. Please don't close it. Don't close it. Don't close it. Don't close it. Please don't close it. You want out? Come on, then. Just like Nicola. Can't make up your mind. Please. God, let me out! Let me out! No. What? What did you do to her?! Where is she?! Please. Please. Frances? I've been going through some old photos. You remember that place we rented in Martha's Vineyard? God, I hate voice mails. Just call me, will you? Oh. How sweet. 5.63 meters. Displacement... - I got three X's. - What was that? My daughter, uh... she's on vacation with a friend. Frances, thanks for that text. It meant so much to me. Like some kind of horrible cloud had lifted. When you come back, let's sit down and talk. We've both been through a lot, but... I won't lose you. Frances, I'm coming into the city. You must be back by now. Call me back. Yeah, I'll buzz you in. Are you ready for your lesson? So you're back? - From where? - From wherever it is you went. Is she inside? No, she went on vacation with you. No, with you. Don't cry, angyalom. We all make mistakes now and then. Come on. Good. One more time. No. C. Pinkie on the C. Kisujj. Go ahead. There was a nurse, Hideg, dismissed from Bellevue Hospital for misuse of anesthetics. No criminal record. Could it be her? I never met the woman. She reportedly returned to Hungary. Left no forwarding address. The files show... Just find her, Mr. Cody, whatever it costs. 250 a day, plus expenses. Drink up, now. Please. Angyalom. We don't want the box again, do we? You needed that to sleep. Alszik a baba. "Mézeskalács." Repeat after me: "Mézeskalács." - "Mézeskalács." - No. "Mézeskalács." You have to be longer on the... on "mézeskalács." "Mézeskalács." One more time. "Mézeskalács." "Mézeskalács." Good. You're learning. You probably call them cookies. Although... although the honey in the dough can make it... how... how do you say?... um... ragados. I bet that means "sticky." My kisujj! No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Samantha? I could use some, too, my darling, but you first. Ay, ay, ay. Ez tényleg fáj. Olyan jó, mint az új. A lady is known... by her shoes and her gloves. And we are nothing if not ladies. She's still alive. Forget about her, angyalom. She's in Heaven now. You are the only one. What a pair we are, hmm? But we can do better. Can't we? My darling. Can I help you? I'm looking for a Greta Hideg. And? I was told she lives here. She does. If you can call it living. Sorry. - Was meant to be amusing. - It was amusing. Are you a roofer? A chimney sweep? I'm looking for any information... Don't tell me you're from the IRS. ...on Frances McCullen. Do you know her? Yes. Yes, I know her. I haven't seen her in a while. Well, I'm a family friend, and they haven't heard from her, either. Oh, really? Would you like to come in? Sure. She went on holiday with her father, I believe. No, she didn't. That's the reason I'm here. I don't get many visitors here. Excuse the clutter. You're going away? Now, are you sure you're not from the IRS? No, I'm not from the IRS. They are the only certainties, aren't they? Death and taxes. Now, who said that? I believe it was Benjamin Franklin. But you didn't come all this way to talk about taxes, did you? No. Frances McCullen. We were acquainted for a while, and then she went away. Poof. Not a word. But that's young people for you. They have their own lives to lead. Please, take a seat. Thank you. Chopin. I love Chopin. Don't you? I like it when it fills the room. She helped me choose Morton. Morton? Morton, my guard dog. Who, by the way, hasn't been fed for... I don't know how long now. Forgive me. Morton, be quiet. Morton, please, will you keep quiet? Morton? Morton? Morton? Stop that banging. You're not from the IRS? Are you sure? - Maybe Homeland Security? - You psycho. We have places for people like you. But all my papers are in order. I'm a naturalized citizen. She's in there, isn't she? She's having a nap, like you will have in 20 seconds or so. I'm taking her with me. Are you sure? Help me! You don't look too good. You missed. Missed again. Ooh. Do you have children? No? A pity. No one to miss you. What a mess. What a dreadful, terrible mess. The bags, you see, were the perfect solution. Who would believe a simple green leather handbag would solve an eternity of loneliness? Endlessly recycled through lost and found. "If found, please return to..." Oh, yes, they brought company. The company was nice for a while, but everything has its end, doesn't it? Even company. I can't place your accent. I'm from Texas. Mézeskalács. I made them myself. - Have one. - Thank you. So, what brings you to New York? Oh, how exciting. I'm trying to be a model. The neighbors. I'm sorry. Remodeling. A little courtesy, please! A little quiet! Thank you. I swear they are building an ark. So, tell me, how does one become a model? Well, you get an agent. Actually, first you get a portfolio, then an agent. So clumsy. Uh, I'll get a towel. - Are you okay? - I... I feel so strange all of a sudden. What... what kind of strange? Do you... do you think that maybe you've been drugged? Think that happened to a friend of mine once. The hours and hours I searched the goddamn subway for that bag. - So, what happens now? - Uh...
