Decades ago, the Helsinki neighborhood known as r??peri - - was a latter-day wild west with criminal gangs ruling the streets. Illegal booze was their most lucrative business - - until drugs arrived, and all hell broke loose. Hey, krisu! - Get in the car. - Why? Just get in. All right. Where are you going? We're just cruising. Right, sale? - Then I'm not getting in. - Get in the car now! Well, I guess it is a bit cold here. What is it? - Everything's okay, right? - Right. Where are we going? Why won't you tell me? C'mon, guys. We're buddies. It's not because l... He didn't get that mad, did he? Where are we going? Damn, this neighborhood looks so different. You know why I think it all started to go wrong? It was the speed. If I had sold just booze - - I wouldn't have gotten into any real trouble. Are we going to the coast? Goddammit. I've always loved the sea. Look. There's always that mystic beauty about it. See how beautiful it is. Hey, hey... Oh, I almost forgot... Don't, for fuck's sake! It's not what you think. I swear. C'mon, I'm not packing. It's not what you think. I swear. C'mon, guys. I know I should have taken care of this earlier. Take this. Take this to him. I'll take care of the 78,000. Fuck, I'll rob a bank if I have to. C'mon, guys, take it. Okay, I've got a better idea. You guys keep it. It'll stay between us. A little compensation for your trouble. So... - This is it then? - As far as I'm concerned. I guess business is business. I'm like, is this the end of krisu's earthly existence? Little Jesse would have lost his daddy. - I have his photo. Want to see? - No. That's okay. All kids look alike anyway. I mean other people's kids. Jesse isn't my son. I mean he is, but he doesn't live with me. It's true what they say. On our way here, my whole life flashed in front of my eyes. It's incredible how much you remember, even me. I always thought it was just people talking... Hellsinki not bad. Kari, look. A walking paycheck coming our way. Oh yeah. Look who's here, late as usual. - Looks like he's in a bad mood. - His car didn't pass inspection. Excuse me, gentlemen. Could you tell me where r??peri is? R??peri? Oh yes. Go back, turn left and walk ahead. When you've been robbed a few times - - you know you're there. - You're there now. - How come you're so late? - I've had it! - With the vehicle inspection? No. Look around you, dammit. Haven't you ever asked yourself if this is it? - What are you talking about? - Life, dammit. - They're taking your license plates? - I meant that this isn't working. - They took your plates? - I'm talking about this hustle! - How long have we sold booze? - For almost ten years. Why? - How much money have you saved? - None. - None. - Exactly. There's no future in this. You got a better idea? We're going to take over the market in r??peri. Take our business to a whole new level. We're in a rut here. So that's what you have been thinking about. Yup. How come? All of a sudden. I've been thinking about it for the past ten years. We've been together for ten years. We've thought about it... Together. I don't really care who sells and who buys. I just want to see money rolling in. - Sure. - Sure thing. If we take over the streets, money will definitely be rolling in. You'll see a boom in business. If you're serious about it - - then expand the territory by taking care of turku jukka. He always pays late anyway. - Hi, mom. - Hi, honey. - Have you seen turku jukka? - I saw him go into the bathroom. - Are you hungry? - I'm starving. - I'll make hot dogs for you. - Great. I'd love that. Jukka, jukka... How's it going? Oh, jukka... Here's the situation. You've taken your last piss and sold your last booze around here. What? What the hell are you talking about? You're going back to turku, and you're staying there. We'll see who goes where. The train to turku leaves at track two. Have a pleasant journey. This is the border. Don't ever cross it again. We still got any competition left? Nazi heka is the last one. - Let krisu and arska deal with it. - Isn't heka in business with uki? Uki is doing time, so heka is all alone. He's jerking off. Put the wiener back in your pants, jerk-off! Heka, heka... You have 15 minutes to get out of town, - - or we'll rip your moustache out one hair at a time. Got it? What an asshole. - Wanna start making money? - Sure! What did I tell you? We're out in the streets freezing anymore. That's for dumb-asses. What are you going to do now? Other than play cowboys? We're running the show now. We'll start a phone service. What's that? Catering service. - Yeah? - I sold them all. Great. - Merry Christmas. - Thanks! There are six customers waiting. Close the store. I'll take care of the rest with tom. Dammit. Can't even rest on Christmas Eve. - Who the hell are you? - Catering service. - What? - You placed an order. Oh, that's right. Let me go get the money. Here. Don't sell it to him. - Give me the bottle. - Maybe you should forget about it. What are you talking about? Here. I'm not selling to you. - This job can be really shitty. - What do you mean? - How come you still have the bottle? - I didn't sell it. If you saw what I saw, you wouldn't have either. - Give me the bottle. - What? We have plenty of these. - Aren't the cops on Christmas break? - Do we split? Roll down the window. Hi. How's it going? You have booze? Why do you ask? You're not parked here for fun. C'mon, I'm not that stupid. Do you or don't you? We don't. Would you sell to me if you did? C'mon, I'm off duty. If we had booze, would you buy it? I guess it depends on the price. Right? - How much do I owe you? - We're not selling anything. This won't change a thing. After the holidays, I'm a cop again. - Cops and robbers... - Sure thing. Okay, guys, take it easy. Merry Christmas. - He's not too bad for a cop. - Yeah. I just don't get it... Time for Christmas dinner. Are you coming? Just a little bit... - Cheers. - Cheers. I haven't forgotten you. Merry Christmas. Buy yourself something nice. Like a new fur hat. When are you buying me a house? You've got shit loads of money. Money's coming in, but it's also going out. I'm going to take a shit. He was so chubby when he was little. You were pretty fat back then. I mean, you're not that flabby now. Well, he isn't skinny either. - Fit as a pig. - I think that's enough. What? I was quite a knockout back in those days. You're still a knockout. - You really mean that? - Too bad tom doesn't take after you. - Fuck, that's enough. - What's the matter? - Why are you so upset? - Do you wanna reminisce? Let's talk about your family for a change. Tom, stop. Just ignore him, krisu. Dad! How's it going, kiddo? Did you see where the man went? We're playing hide and seek. I'll give you one mark if you tell me. Dad! Well, well. You again, kiddo. You want more money or what? Jesus. Look how far we've come in two years. We're not there yet. C'mon. Bootlegging is in the past for us. American bar will be our new hangout. Lindstr?m must really like us. - Whiskey. - I'll have the same. - So, how are things? - We've definitely arrived. Seeing as you're here anyway, - - could you beat up a couple of guys for me? - Is that why you asked us here? - Oh no. But could you do it? I can't get involved in something like that. Here in the lobby? Wherever you like. See those two guys over there? The fat one is business Mara, and the skinnier one is konttila. Sure, why not. I have no problem with taking care of business. I want to file a complaint. The officers used unnecessary force when they arrested us. Same for me. So you hang out at the American bar these days? I thought it was a place for big boys. You know who you beat up? Deputy police chief huhta and chief superintendent viita. I wonder why they didn't press charges. Who set you on them? Was it reijo lindstr?m? He's the one who finances you, right? So be it. Oh, did you know that uki gets out tomorrow? - I thought he had two years left. - No. Early release for good behavior. Good behavior? Uki? That's right. Be careful. He still holds a grudge against you for taking his territory. What territory? The booze territory. - Nazi heka. Remember him? - Never heard of him. We don't even sell booze. You can go. Go ahead. - Listen, koistinen... - What the fuck! - Koistinen... - Yeah? - When are you going home? - Soon. Why? Well, it's raining, so I thought you might give us a ride. - Okay. But no work stuff. - Of course not. - And be careful with uki. I mean it. - Aren't you exaggerating a bit? Uki! Tell tom and krisu and everyone... That uki's back. What do you mean you didn't hear or see anything? You were stabbed in the stomach, not in the back. Tell me who it was. Uki? - I don't know anyone named uki. - Oh, you don't? - You were best man at his wedding. - Oh, you mean that uki? Yes, him. - Isn't he in jail? - Take him away, for Christ's sake! Uki wants to see us. - Was that him on the phone? - No, that was Nazi heka. - Where does he want to meet? - Outside the city. There's a warrant out for him. - A warrant out for heka? - No, for uki. Then we'll have to go to him and negotiate. No use in all of us going. I hear he's driving around with a sub in his lap looking for us. That way we won't all die if he's in a killing mood. We'll draw lots to see who goes. Let me show you something. Uki, can't we negotiate the territories? Why don't we divide r??peri in half? North side and south side. - I'm not into bootlegging anymore. - Oh. Since when? - Since this. - For Christ's sake. He just called me on the phone. He won't be calling no more. What did he die from? This. - Why? - I'm on a short fuse when I'm drunk. Heka knew it, but he just kept provoking me. Now I need a passport. Then we're quits. I see. Where are you going? - Norway, for example. - Norway? If you're going to split town, you should get out of Europe. Cops will find you and bring you back. You should go to south America or the far east and keep a low profile. You got money? Forget about exotic places. It's no use going if you're broke. Where should I go then? Well... I suggest you go back to the city and talk to the cops. Tell them you shot the wrong man. That you were a little trigger-happy. They'll understand. - I can't say that! - Of course you can. Think about it. You know it's not easy being on the run. You can't drink. You can't make mistakes. - You need to blend in. Right? - Yeah, you have a point. You'll be out before you know it. They could never hold you very long. You're a pro. You're a great fuckin' guy. Damn. Stop, uki. Stop. C'mon, I'm not gonna kill you now! Jesus, uki... - Fucking hell. - That's the way it goes. A date? - We were supposed to have a meeting. - I don't have the time. You're not seeing the same girl again, are you? The cashier? Yes, that's her. - Monika. - Has she given it up yet? What's that got to do with anything? Have you noticed that he's been smiling to himself? No. I'm afraid he wants to settle down. And start playing house. I'm never getting married. No one would marry you anyway. True. - You know what I've been thinking? - What? If we didn't have to pay lindstr?m, - - we'd be doing great. - We are doing great. - But we'd be doing better. - Oh, you mean more money. - Money, money. We'd get really rich. We'd be running the city. Think about it. - Is it true what they say about you? - Depends on who's saying it. - Have you been engaged ten times? - No. - Sixteen times. - Are you sick? I care about you. I want to be honest with you. Why? I fell in love with you the first time I fucked you. You're the first girl I can imagine fucking for the rest of my life. - How do I know I can trust you? - I'm a professional criminal. I don't see the logic in that. You wanna get serious with me, you need to start doing something else. Excuse me? You must be interested in other things besides bootlegging. I've thought about studying safe cracking. I meant something other than criminal stuff. What did you dream about when you were little? When I was little? I dreamed of having a father like everyone else. I would've liked to have known him before he left. When I got older, I wanted to bump into him and beat him up. Then I realized I might have already. I mean, I never knew him. Then I stopped dreaming. - Why won't you believe me? - Where is lindstr?m? Why are you asking me? I'm just a janitor. - People say he's gone south. - Why would he do that? They're saying he went too far with the cops, and they didn't like it. - Don't believe everything you hear. - What else are they saying? They're saying that someone might have killed him. Who'd want to kill him? - Who knows? - What? You think we're going to pay for that information? - You got it? - Yeah. Hey, some of that was my money! You don't want to play tag with us. This is not good. Not good at all. - You know what I think? - What? - It wasn't my idea. - But you said... Shut up. - Where did you take him? - Who? Lindstr?m! - Stop yelling! - We dumped him in the sea. - How? - We had a boat. - Whose was it? - Lindstr?m's! Not the body, the boat! - I don't know. - We took it from the harbor. But we put it back where we found it. - They'll never connect us to it. - Shut up, for Christ's sake! Please tell kari to give us his name at least. Or at least say hello. He probably won't tell us what he did last Tuesday night. "Bergstr?m was walking on korkeavuorenkatu towards the park." "He met a man, a stranger, and went into the restaurant sea horse." "He ordered onion steak with fries, - - after which he remembers nothing." "In a second statement, he said he ordered a double portion of fries, - - after which he remembers nothing." - Happy? - Yes. Now it's accurate. You have to be careful with these. I didn't come here to lie. C'mon, krisu. You're not mad anymore, are you? - At me? - Yeah. No, I'm not. No use sweating the small stuff. Right? These things happen. But I don't want it happening ever again. The good thing is, now we'll be making a shit load of money. That's great, because I need start-up capital. You're not going to be doing something decent, are you? - Are you sure it's worth it? - We'll see. Are you going to tell us what it is? I'll tell you when everything is set. Are you starting a family? Or does she have a bun in the oven already? - What do you mean? - Nothing. Why do you always have a problem with my women? - So what if Monika is pregnant? - So what? - You have a son yourself. - A daughter. - How old is she? - You mean jaana? Let's see... She's... Take care of your own kid - - before you stick your nose in other people's business. Krisu... I'm sorry. The fact that I blew it with my kid is nobody's business. You think I don't think about it every single day? Hi. What the hell are you doing here? Stalking us? It's a public park. A public park 50 km from Helsinki. That's where you live, right? I said this is a public park. So it's just a coincidence that you're standing there? That you drove here all the way from Helsinki? I'm not saying it's a coincidence. I just wanted to see jaana. I don't want her to see you. I don't want her to start asking questions. I'm her dad after all. You were her dad. - I have rights, you know. - Rights? Look who's talking. I don't want to see you. And I don't want jaana to know anything about you. Marja... Take this to her. Marja. You can open your eyes now. Well? - What do you think? - What is this? It's nothing yet, but it will be. - A porn magazine. - I'll sell them here. - These? Pussy photos? - Yup. - You can't sell pussy photos. - Of course I can. And all other kinds of porn stuff. I'll write "emperor of sex" on the window. - "Emperor of sex"? - Yes, that's the name of the store. You said I should get a decent job if I wanted to marry you. What did you just say? - That I should get a decent job. - No, the other part. Was that a proposal? I guess it was. - Hi. - Hi. So? What do you think? Looks like kari found something interesting. - This is damn perverted. - Perverted? That's the point. It's a sex shop. I get the stuff from Sweden and Denmark, - - and it's so hot I need asbestos gloves to handle it. This store will be so perverted, i can barely stand to be in here. How will the customers stand it? They will. They're kinky. Once the words spreads, there'll be a stampede in here. I've got stuff no one else in this country has. I have sleazy films - - where people are fucked in the anal and canal and who knows where. Hi. That's what we've heard. That's why we decided to drop by. - But this is our grand opening. - This is a raid. Put them in the car. Here's the receipt. Twelve boxes. C'mon, it's nothing personal. Congratulations on the store. Selling beer in food stores? This law will turn people into drunks. - What are you so upset about? - Take a look. No way. I never imagined anything like that, even in my wildest nightmares. People buying beer at the grocery stores. - It'll kill bootlegging. - It won't last long. I give it a year, then it's over. For good. - Is that what you've been planning? - Business is hurting. - Why Sweden? - It's obvious. Blame the law. In Sweden, there's still a market for illegal booze. Teukka will help us settle. - Teukka lahtinen? - Yeah. What's the problem? He can shoot, and he speaks Swedish. I'm so happy that you guys are looking after my baby. Kari wouldn't make it on his own in this business. Kari is our man. We don't let our friends down. You are good men. I'm in. Nothing is going to keep me here, not even the cops. Kari? I don't know. I don't speak Swedish. It doesn't matter. Teukka will teach us the basics. Tom? I'm not going. I have Monika and the emperor of sex. You really think you'll make a living selling pussy photos? Tjugo. Okay, krisu. Tjugo. Tjugo. "Tjugo" is twenty. Swedish is easy, isn't it? Arska, say tjugo. Arska, say tjugo. Kari, say tjugo. Say it again. Tjugo. It can't be that hard. "Tjugo". Finally. Good job, guys. You know the language now. - What if there's inflation? - Twenty-five is "tjugofem". - Tjugofem? - Yes. - Meatballs are "k?ttbullar". - K?ttbullar? - Say it. - K?ttbullar. Fuck! Fuck it, I'm going home. I'm not going. I'll starve there. You can keep your meatballs. C'mon, kari! You'll never make it here on your own. Mom! Hi! I'm home. Is dinner ready? Oh no... Everything's gone... It's going to be okay. I'm so happy that you guys are looking after my baby. What do the cops want? Can't I bury my own mother without them hassling me? I thought you might need help carrying the casket. I mean you're all she had. My condolences. To tyyne. To mom. Are you going to be okay? Are you sure? I heard you lost the apartment. Yes, it belonged... To the company my mom worked for. - You've got a place to stay now? - Yeah. I'm renting a room. It's kind of like a dorm. - Just for starters. - Kari. Kari! If you need anything, just ask. I'll be okay. I'll find something. Hands up! This is a robbery. Fuck! Hi, tom. How's it going? Couldn't come up with anything else? It wasn't my idea. It was this guy romppanen. - But I'm fine. Everything's great. - C'mon, you're in jail. Yeah, but I have a roof over my head and clean clothes. Three square meals a day. Only thing missing is my mom. True. What the hell is that on your neck? - What is that shit? - Oh, my new tattoo? Rough, huh? The guys bet me i wouldn't have the guts. I won. - How much? - A tenner. Oh, yeah. I've been learning how to read and write here. I mean I've been trying to learn, but it's pretty fucking hard. But I've still got time. What? Turn around. Okay, you can open your eyes. - What is this? - Our new home. Everything's brand new. Furniture and all. You're my woman, and I'll take care of you like I promised. You can just sit back and relax. Well, what do you think? I guess it'll have to do. - What? - I mean for starters. I think the couch is a bit aggressive. - Aggressive? The couch? - Yes. I used all my savings and took out a hefty loan for this place. The store hardly turns a profit, and you tell me the couch is aggressive? But it is. It'll have to go then. - C'mon. Stop! - I'm just getting started! If you're going to buy something, do it already. Take it easy. My name is cracker. I don't care if your name is cookie. You'll still have to pay. Cracker. Don't you know who I am? Does it look like I know who you are? That's okay. You'll find out. Everyone will. I'm selling. - You want cigarettes? - What cigarettes? I can get my hands on a number of cigarettes. I thought you might be interested. I could sell you cigarettes. And anything else you might want. - That's what you thought, huh? - Yes, that's what I thought. I'll take the cigarettes if we can come to terms. But don't think this is the beginning of something beautiful and lasting. How many cartons do you have? Well, as many as can you fit into a cigarette company truck. Grocery money for you. - I told you. - What? That you can make a living doing something decent. Take your coat off. I don't have any more room. Did you rob a department store? We'll put the leather coats here. What do you mean you can't take them? I just got the jeans you ordered. I know, but I can't take them right now. - Afraid of the cops, are you? - I'm not afraid of anything. - You can't do this to me. - I'm doing it right now. But you can't. Besides, you haven't paid for the tape recorders yet. You see any tape recorders here? What? Go ask the cops for your money back. I'm sure they'll understand. This is not how it goes. It's your risk, not mine. It's our risk! This is business! Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose! But we stay together! And this time we lost together! I'm serious. We'll see when I get out of this mess. We won't see anything. We're done. Who's a little crybaby? You're a fucking asshole. You'll pay for this. Empty. I don't have anything. "Finnish mafia brings American-style gangsterism to Sweden." The guys are making a career and a lot of money in Sweden. They sent me this. "Get over here. This is paradise for a pro. Krisu, arska and teukka." Lgnore them. That lifestyle is over for you. Tom. You're not involved in anything illegal, are you? Of course not. Isn't it great that we get to do time together? Too bad you got such a short sentence. Shit, I must have eaten something bad. The bank foreclosed on the apartment. - Why don't you go stay at my mom's? - Your mom? Don't you know? - Know what? - I thought she'd told you. She hasn't come here once to tell me anything about anything. She moved to Sweden. She got tired of waiting for you to buy her a house. Everything will be all right again when I get out. You're going to be a dad. It changes everything, right? But you have to start being honest with me. Welcome home. - Well, it's bigger than the cell. - We'll be fine. Aren't you coming to bed? Monika. I have a solution to our situation. I met a guy in jail, and I was thinking that l... Yeah? What if I got into drugs? Amphetamines. No. We have baby on the way. Exactly. I want our kid to have all the things I never did. Bought with drug money? What the fuck are you thinking? If you get involved with drugs, - - I'm leaving you. Got it? Give me the cash! This is a robbery! - Jesus... - Did you hear what I said? Get the hell out. Wait, empty your pockets first. - What? - Empty your pockets. Put your stuff on the counter. Take your coat off. Now get out. Tom. Tom, tom... - Look at this. - What? Mail order business. You can sell your stuff all over the country. You always say people are too shy to come into the store. Now you can come to them. You put ads in magazines. You send stuff in discreet packages and write "sporting goods" on them. I don't have money for the marketing. Banks are full of money. You want me to rob a bank? No. Take out a loan, silly. I see you were convicted for fencing stolen goods. I did time for it already. I've decided to become a decent citizen. Are you sure your business can make a profit? Not at all. If I don't do something, the emperor of sex will go under. I thought I'd give it one last shot and see what happens. It doesn't matter how we go down if we do. Business is always risky, right? I guess that's that. I've been thinking that maybe we could try something new. Like what? Drugs are in now. No, I mean instead of meatballs. - You don't like meatballs? - Something wrong with them? - Let me have yours then. - Get your hands off! I'm hungry. - You just said you don't like them. - That's not what I said! I'll go take a leak. You kids can fight over food. - I'm not fighting over anything. - Does your mom cook better? She does, but it's not that. I'd just like to try something new. You can starve for all I care, but that won't happen anytime soon. - That's unfair. - What? Arska? Teukka? Well? Well. I'm done with Sweden. I'll start dealing here. - Speed? - Yeah. There's money in it. - I've already got a financier. - You said there's money in it. You were in the business for three years. Don't you have any savings? No. How come? Because Sweden is expensive as hell. - You've come a long way. - Can't say the same thing for you. You're still wearing the same coat. And shoes. - Will you lend me the money? - Are you in a hurry? I'm not going to wait here all night. I'm offering you an insider's interest rate. - An insider's interest rate? - I won't pay more. Insider's rate, take it or leave it. Pera, come here. Come over here. Could you repeat what you said? I told cracker I'm offering him an insider's interest rate. - Did you hear that? - An insider's interest rate? What the hell is that? Our ad is in all of them. I'm a little worried about paying back the loan. We'll be fine. - I don't have any. - Not even seven hundred? No. - You're hustling, aren't you? - Oh yeah. In the beginning everything that comes in goes out. And then some. It stinks in here. No wonder you look like a ghost. - What the hell is this? - What? - This. - Oh, that. - How long have you been using? - A couple of years. - Why? - Well... It was when we started dealing in Stockholm. We were buying from this guy named olle. He thought we were cops. I told him in Finnish we weren't. One day he puts a needle and a belt and all on the table. Takes the safety off his gun and asks if we want to try. Arska says no way and that he's afraid of needles. Olle says one of us has to volunteer or our lungs would soon be whistling. I'm like: "Calm down. I'll do it for the business." That's how it started. This is not good. Not good at all. C'mon. It's not that bad. When you shoot up, the world looks like an okay place for a while. You just don't get it. Tom! Don't come around here acting all superior! - You were supposed to bring a grand. - I know, but... - You don't have the whole sum. - No. It's taking longer than I expected. - This is not what we agreed on. - You're right. But that's money, too. Pera, have you seen money around here? - No. - What was the old man talking about? Restart the game. Guys... Guys! We were in the middle of something. I guess we were. Take your shoes off. What? "What? What? What?" "This is business. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose." "But we stay together." Remember who said that? - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. I think the interest rate just went up. Especially the insider's rate. - Half the store's profit. How long? - I don't know. - Why don't you call the cops? - Call the cops? You know it doesn't work like that! Who said we were going to be fine... Hello? Mail for "tom's sporting goods". - What's with the potato sack? - It's your mail. Well, a part of it. Got the new German stuff? Christ, this is getting out of hand. We're getting orders from all over the country. We need help. This will change our life. We can buy a house. Monika! We'll try again. It's not the end of the world. I can't have children. Ever. All right. There it is. Our new home. What do you think? What do we need a big house for now? - Monika... - Don't touch me. It makes me sick. - It's your first leave next week. - That's what they said. Bring me speed when you come back. You'll carry speed in your ass when you come back. - Where? - In the rectum. - Whose rectum? - Whose? Think about it. Yours, of course. I don't think so. I'm not carrying anything in my rectum. If you don't, something might happen to you. Let's see right now what might happen. I know you'll bring it. It's really not your choice. What? Are you drinking whiskey? - You never drink. - I do now. You can't. You know I can't stand it. Don't you get it? Everything's looking good for us. - Everything will change. - Everything has changed already. If it's about a baby, we can adopt. It's not the same. And you can't. You have a criminal record. They won't give you a child. You're scum. Scum? Did I get it right? You don't want to take leave. - I'm not taking any leave. - But your application was approved. I don't care. I'm not going. And I'm not doing any rectum gigs. - What? - I'm not taking any leave. You don't have to, but at least take a few days off from the workshop. No way. I like making sauna buckets. It passes the time. - You shouldn't take it personally. - Personally? She's my wife. I get that, I do, but still. She drinks every day. I don't see the problem. I drink every day too, and I'm doing great. - You want some? - Thanks, I've had enough. I've never seen you drunk, you know. - You only ever have a drink or two. - I don't like being drunk. I'm not me when I'm drunk. Monika and I have money and a house she's always dreamed of. We have almost everything. But we don't have each other anymore. You're exaggerating. I've been away too much. The more the better. I thought... It would go away. But I guess it won't, unless I do something. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, why am I talking to you? I need to talk to Monika. About everything. Where are you going? - Uki? Why did you hit me? - What the fuck is wrong with this? - I thought we were buddies. - It's the gloves. They're slippery. It was the ass gig, right? Monika! We need to talk. You'll be okay, tom. Life goes on, right? What life? - Welcome back. - Thanks. Great to see you again. What is it? - I'm just nervous about it all. - You'll be fine. We'll go get krisu, and then we'll party. - What are we celebrating? - You haven't changed one bit. - I'm not going anywhere. - What do you mean? C'mon, kari just got out. Yeah, yeah. Congratulations and all that. I've got stuff to do. Yeah, I can see that. - Are you in trouble? - No. Everything is fucking great. Business is booming. Cut back on the drugs. Could you lend me 16,000? Kari, let's go. Sure. Get the fuck out, you... Get the fuck out. How come he's turned into a druggie? Well, he is... We've kind of drifted apart. - Would it help if I beat him up? - I don't think so. You could always try. I'm sure a lot of people have tried. For fuck's sake, guys... Don't kill me! Don't kill me, for Christ's sake. Don't kill me, dammit! Don't kill me, for fuck's sake. I was robbed. I was robbed last week. I'll pay you back. Fuck you! - Did I say anything about killing? - No. - But maybe you'd like me to? - Fuck you, kiddo. Fuck, I hate junkies! He looks like an owl with that blank stare in his eyes. - Now he's having spasms. - We'll give him a week. When I was in prison, i often thought about - - how great it would be if you could turn back the clock. I loved the days when we were bootlegging on the street. - It was a crappy business. - Yeah, but still. It was so much nicer than this fucking... How did it turn into this? Everything was better before. Mom was alive. Who are you? What's going on here? So you owe cracker 16,000, you and the girl. 16,500. But we've already got the 500. - Can you help us with the rest? - Your solution was to rob me, huh? They want the money tomorrow. We're going to have a baby. I miss you. Things just aren't working, mom... When you're not here to tell me what to do. This is a robbery! Everybody down! Nobody move! And you. Put the money in the bag. - Nobody move! - The zipper's stuck. - The zipper won't budge. - Shit! Give it to me! Fuck, you have to do everything yourself. Put the money in the bag, and make it quick! This might not have been the best choice. This bank. There's a police station just across the street. Listen, girl... give it to me! I don't need your fucking advice! It's not the first time l... - Police! Drop your gun! - Go ahead and shoot! I'll put a hole in her head. - Drop the gun! - Go ahead and shoot! C'mon! Calm down, I'll take care of this. I know the guy. Don't get any closer! No closer, dammit! Kari, what the fuck are you doing? Drop the gun, before someone gets hurt. Okay? What do I get if I surrender now? - What do I get if I surrender now? - My bet is five to six years. Are you sure I'll get at least five years? - With no parole? - I promise. - Okay. - Cuff him! Cuff him! - Come get me, for fuck's sake! - What? This is a starter pistol. It's not! I won't get a shorter sentence because of it, will I? - "Sock in wine". - No, it's "cock in wine". - One of the letters is wrong. - Who cares! Where are all your customers? It's a small place, and empty. - We're not open yet. - Shut up! Don't you fucking talk to krista like that! She's the mother of my unborn child. C'mon... It won't... It won't make a profit. It's too small. You've got four tables. Four seats per table. Sixteen customers. You owe sixteen grand. - You're all in deep shit. - No, we're not. I've got this great idea, you see. The top of the table is like this. All the tables are alike. If you screw a piece of board to it, you can get two more seats per table. Four tables and two more seats. We'll have twenty-four chairs. You came up with all that? - Don't tell anyone about it. - I won't. I've got more great ideas. You won't be disappointed. You'll get your money back, i fucking guarantee it. This is our dream like the store was yours. - Don't compare it to this place. - Fuck, tom! I'm forty! I'm forty! I have nothing! Not a fucking thing! I've made nothing but mistakes so far. You get me? I have... We want this chance. - To hell with you. - It's better this way. - How? You're back here again. - Yes. This is my home. No, this is jail. I'm happy here. What is it? - Have you seen krisu? - Not lately. - Define lately. - A couple of weeks. Let me guess. He didn't pay you the 16,500. 16,500? He owes me 40,000. - Have you checked out his diner? - What diner? For sale no one has bought it. Or even looked at the place. It's been empty going on a year now. The owner went bankrupt. Which was a hell of a good thing. - The food here was really shitty. - Stick to the point. Yeah, well... The residents say they saw suspicious activity here a month ago. We changed the locks and haven't seen any more junkies. Since then, this place has been rotting in peace. Krisu, krisu... Copenhagen - hi. - Oh... Oh shit. Take it easy. Nothing official this time. I came to say goodbye. - I have to step up my career, too. - Why can't you do it here? Here, you have to be a politician and a cop. I'm just a cop. I hope it'll do in a smaller town. The world has changed. The new generation of crooks doesn't play by our rules. To be honest with you... I miss the good old days. Yeah. We've been through a lot. Take care. You've given me a lot. At least you've given me work. I can't say I'll miss you, but you're one of the few cops that... Behave yourself, okay? And try to get along with the young ones. Damn... Hi, tom. You're not mad at me anymore, are you? Where's the girl? Who? She was pregnant. Where's the baby? Jesse? No, you see... - Where's the baby? - They took him from us. I wanted to keep him, of course, but... I have a photo. Do you want to see? Somewhere... Here it is. Look. This is Jesse. A handsome little guy, huh? Looks a lot like me, doesn't he? Look at his eyes. That's okay. I'll look at it later. Okay, but that's what happened... All kinds of stuff... You know... I've been thinking... I went downtown. And I walked by a stationery store. They had stickers on display. Fine stickers. I thought that would be a good business. What the fuck are you talking about? Let me show you something. I want to get into the sticker business. - Let's go! - Tom, stop! You can be my partner... - Still interested in stickers? - It's a good business! - Are we on the same planet now? - Fuck you! - Are we? Are we? - Yes. Good. And now you can sit there quietly - - while I figure out what the fuck I'm going to do with you. That's sixty grand. It should be enough for cracker. - What the fuck? - If you don't pay, they'll kill you. They would have taken care of you already if they knew you were back. How am I ever going to pay you back? You'll come work for me. I need help at the sex shop. C'mon, for fuck's sake... That's the way it is. Take it or leave it. What should I do? Take the money. I'll talk to cracker. I'll arrange a meeting. Tom. Can I borrow your car tomorrow? Hey, wait! Did you just come to our door? Your door? - Not that I know of. - But you were in the building. Someone put this through our mail slot. It has my name on it. Jaana is a pretty name. I have a daughter named jaana. - How old are you? - Sixteen. You're the same age. Uki! - Oh, hi tom. - Did you break out of prison? Yeah. Doing time started to piss me off. Uki is back in business. That window glass cost 200. - We'll deduct it from your debt. - What fucking debt? Tom, tom... You and your buddies took my turf. I realized it was a shitty deal. According to my calculations, you owe me a 100 grand. I'll start with this. - You're not taking anything. - I take what I want. Then I take your gun and we'll check the safe in your back room. - Put the money back! - There's nothing in here. Empty. - Do as I say, or I'll shoot. - You don't have the balls. We both know it. If you did, you'd have killed a lot of guys already. I've sent so many to the cemetery, i lost count a long time ago. And you're next. Give me the gun. I promise it won't hurt. I'll shoot you in the face. Fuck, it's uki. What the hell is he doing here? - He's on leave. - What are we going to do with him? Haven't seen him. I was expecting him. Guys, have you seen krisu? Sorry, no krisu. Knowing him, - - I'd say he's gone to Sweden. Or Copenhagen. Or somewhere. - After he gave that to you? - Gave me what? That ring. He's worn that as long as I've known him. He wore it yesterday. - And now you have it. - What are you talking about? I've always had this. It's a family heirloom. What have you done with krisu? - We'll sort this out now. - "We'll sort this out now." For fucks's sake, you're an old fart. Get the fuck out, or I'll show you what happened to your druggie friend. Are you alone? Looks like papa's going to pay. Once again. I've been thinking. R??peri is too small for the both of us. Let's make a deal to see which one of us goes. I don't fuckin' believe you. You think we could make a deal? You must've run away from the circus. I'm getting scared. Oh, krisu says hi. He sent you this. Like I said, r??peri is too small for the both of us. But if you leave now and never come back, - - you get to walk away on your own two feet. Guys, don't go anywhere.
