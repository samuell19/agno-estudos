You were supposed to make sure that my brother was murdered. Without proof of his death, I cannot be king. My brother must be found and killed. Then I can really become king of England. Lies, lies. Listen carefully, Fox. I want to become king. I will do anything to make sure that I am crowned. Your job is to find my brother and murder him. Or I'll kill you. What was that? Did you hear something? Oh. I trusted him. But he's evil, just like me. Perhaps I can never change. Are we always to be greedy and selfish? ♪ That little jewel, it looks so harmless. But I would have killed to possess it. Perhaps I can never change. Ah! There's someone there. Alwine? What shall I do with him? Kill him! Sire. (laughter) ♪ Your highness, look! (laughter) He's crazy. Kill him. (laughter) ♪ What's so funny, Baron? Death is no laughing matter. I hope you will forgive me if I speak rudely or out of turn. But I have to say, I learned from you, Count. A man of ambition should never reveal his true feelings, especially when in danger. Quickly now. Just what are you getting at? With great respect, Count John, I am like you, a man of great ambition. I aimed to improve my lot in this miserable life. Enough, Baron, your time is up. -No, wait. -Why wait? Impressive, your speech has saved your life. Alwine, can you be loyal to me? On my life, I most solemnly swear allegiance to you, Count John, future king of England. And in return? Oh, not that much, I'd settle for Governor of Nottingham. And I hope I can learn to win the respect and love of the people just as you have. Ah, excellent. So be it then. We'll meet later on to talk. There are many plans for us to discuss. As you wish. Perfect, they played right into my hands, the hopeless fools. Now with John's power to aid me, nothing will stop me from ruling this land. Nothing! ♪ I mean for him to be organizing an archery competition-- Well, maybe he's decided to turn over a whole new leaf. Yeah, and there's no charge.

Well, it's some--I-- Splendid, we'll discuss it later. ♪ Wow. Looks kind of serious, doesn't he? The Count John, our king's own brother. I know, he's much more powerful than Alwine. Good people of Nottingham, today is a very special day, for we are indeed honored and privileged to be graced by the presence of so great a man as Count John. Now, fine citizens, before the contest, the noble count would like to speak. Thank you, Baron Alwine. I know that once my dear brother is not with us, we are all sad. Believe me, my good friends, there is not a single day that goes by when I do not think of him. ♪ I want you to know I am doing everything in my power to find him.

Alwine 's been faithful to no one but himself. Yeah, if the count knew him like we knew him, he wouldn't be saying that. Alwine 's as evil as ever. Now let the competition begin.

All these people are enjoying themselves here today because of this competition. Mm-hmm. Hey, there's Alwine. ♪ I think I'm going to go talk to him. -Why? -'Cause I have to thank him. What exactly did you wish to speak to me about, Baron? Since we understand each other so well, dear Bishop, I thought you might be interested in a little caper, I've planned. How deliciously thoughtful of you, dear Baron. As you know, I'm always keen on personal gain. Pray, tell me more. Well, now that I've won John's trust, this scheme of mine simply cannot fail. What are you up to? I think the Baron must've gone this way. ♪ Now am I to believe my ears? The king, you say? Oh, but I am deadly serious. If Count John were to be king, then we'd be made rich beyond our wildest dreams. Attractive, isn't it? ♪ Further, since I am now his most humble servant and trusted right hand man, it would be a simple matter to become-- But more of that later, do you like the plan? I'm a great fan of your wickedness. -But will it work? -Oh, yes. My dear, Baron, you really are splendidly bad. But there's one thing that puzzles me about this archery contest. Why have you spent good money just so the people can enjoy themselves? If there's one thing I've learned from the Count, it's a very special way of looking after the people. (laughter) Huh? Huh? Someone must've heard us. Get them. Come back, sneak. I'd catch him myself, but leg's playing up. Faster! Faster! Hogs and hounds, who could've spied on us? I must silence them, or we're finished. ♪ Stop, I say. Stop you little-- Huh? Oh, Robin. Oh, hi there, Baron. Where have you been? I've been looking for you? You--it wasn't you then? -Wasn't me when? -Maybe I was wrong. I could've sworn it was him at the door. But it was so dark. No, it must've been him. Yes, Baron? Might I have a word, old champ? Okay. Wow, this is some view. Gosh, you can see everything from this part of the castle. Hey, is that Much down there? I just can't figure him out, he's dangerous, that's for sure. Too dangerous. I'll have to silence him. Yes, it's the only way. ♪ -Now. -Alwine? Oh, what is it Robin? This bow used to belong to my father. How splendid! It's been a great friend to me in times of trouble. And it also has magical powers. Really? Any man who is cruel, greedy, and dishonest cannot draw this bow. Oh, that's--that's amazing. Go on and have a try, Baron. No, really-- Oh, surely now, you must be able to do it. -Forty-five score. -Okay! Nice shot, right on, Much, I'm proud of you. Oh, yeah! Oh, now I'm so ashamed. You know, I never thought I'd see the day. Just look at everybody. Peace and happiness and joy have returned to Nottingham castle. And it's all due to their sheriff. And you, Alwine, have turned out to be a very fine sheriff. I was wrong. Come on. Try it, Alwine. No, Robin. Be a very fine sheriff. No. I'm still not worthy of drawing this bow, although I'm trying. I am not fully free of my sins. Now go and finish the contest. I wish you luck. I'll stay here and think. Go now. Off you go. Oh, I love it. Alwine, the sincere and sorry Baron, you old fox. You don't have to double-cross anyone, you know? You did hear us. Yes, Baron, I did hear something. Ugh! Oh! Ugh! Bull's eye. I have no idea what you and Bishop Hartford were planning about Count John. But you can still change your mind. You've made such a great start. You've proved you can be good. Remember the promise you made us. Listen, it's not too late. So think about it. But why did you pretend not to have heard? Alwine, I'll never tell anyone that you had a moment of weakness. Oh, but Robin, Robin. I can't change my ways now. It's too late. I'll never do it. Hey, yes, you can. Hmmm! Not worthy. Huh? I'm not worthy. You have seen into my wretched heart, Robin. It's true there was a moment when I doubted my ways and regretted my wickedness. But it's too late now. I have gone far too far this time. What have you done? Oh! I'm such a fool. What? (laughter) I poisoned the Count's apple. What? What have I done? What have I done? -It's not true. -It is. In my greed, I wanted the throne for me. Hey, Count John! Don't eat that apple.

You fool, what do you think I could have possibly gained by killing the count, hmm? The apple that you shot wasn't poisoned. I lied. Quickly, bring him to me. Not so fast, boy. Well, do your worst, Baron. You'll never get away with this, I swear. Now, you listen to me. I have no intention of watching you be executed. So be gone. As of now, you're an outlaw. If I were you, I'd leave, and rather quickly at that, Robin Hood. No way! They're in there! Yeah! Open up! Will, run! Get away, escape! -What's going on? -Come on, you guys. There's no point hanging around up there at the window. We haven't got a second to lose, let's go. Will you just listen to me for once in your life? -We'll be back! -Marian! Robin will be okay, you'll see. Right now, I think we should go. ♪ Hey, Baron, I'm going to tell the truth now. And then you'll be finished. I hardly think so, oh, dear me, no. You see, in the eyes of everyone else, you're a weasely little stoat. And of course, I'm still the honorable Baron Alwine. So no one's going to believe you, I'm afraid. Let me give you a tip. The truth will always win out. After him. The criminal must not escape us. There are several truths, Robin, depending on the situation. Where's Alwine? I demand an explanation. I say that he's not to be trusted. I agree. But he will be useful to us. Yes. ♪ Phew, that was close. (splashing) Oh, I hope everyone else made it to safety. Huh? Oh, no, not that! ♪ Good work, men!
