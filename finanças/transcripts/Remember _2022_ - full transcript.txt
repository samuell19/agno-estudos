Why am I... here? REMEMBER Freddie You can't chill out alone because you came early. You've become very lazy lately. Break time is over, wake up Freddie! Wake up! Wake up, Freddie! Freddie. Why are you looking at me like that? It's me, Jason. Freddie Vs. Jason! Jason Even if your memory went bad, how could you forget me? I'm so disappointed! Oh, bro! Oh, bro! I feel like myself now. Let's go serve dinner! Where are you going? You got a show to put on. Merry Christmas! Here's your cake. Since your birthday coincides with Christmas, Santa Clause will sing you the song! Happy birthday song is too common, it doesn't suit your day So we'll sing you a new birthday song to celebrate with you Today is a happy day, today is a good day, what a beautiful world Let's all gather around and wish Baek Jin-su a happy birthday Congratulations! Happy birthday! Have a great meal! Good job, Freddie. My body isn't what it used to be, my moves aren't the same. You're still classy as ever. I better retire for the sake of my juniors. Don't ever mention that. Are you really going to quit this week? My brain's all rotten, I can't remember the menu. Buddy! Why are you telling me to pay for this? You asked for more soup and lemonade earlier. Christ! I thought they were refillable! If you said they cost extra, I'd have asked for a Coke! Sir, you know those are always extra, you've been here before. Then you should've said so. Forget it, I refuse to pay for this, so refund me these two things. Eh? You want to start a staring contest?! My apologies, I'm really sorry, sir. Go on, take his card. Now! What did the manager say? He was bitching, so I told him to take it from my pay. How much was the damage? A soup and 2 lemonades, so $40 in total. He ate a ton. You gotta take it back. If he was willing, he wouldn't have caused a scene. I was baiting him to hit me, but the manager came right then. I could've pressed an assault charge on him. You can't win against your foe with such a weak strategy. You know, when I was in the Vietnam, I was fighting against the Viet Congs, I planted something without anyone knowing, know what that was? Vietnam War again? You didn't ask, not curious, is that it? Fine, skip it. Come on, Mr. Han, why are you so impatient? So, what did you plant? Booby trap. Excuse me! Wait! Sir. Weren't you just in the washroom? Yes, is something wrong? Did you see a wallet by any chance? A wallet? No, I didn't see it. You were the only one who used it after me. I really don't know. You could've dropped it somewhere else. Hey, what are you doing?! Wait! Wait a moment! A young fellow like you shouldn't lie. I'm short $40. No, I didn't even touch that wallet. You swiped it, you certainly touched it. Give me back my $40. What about $40?! We can resolve this at the police station. I really didn't take the money! You're testing my patience by being stubborn. Test your patience?! Baby! Give it back and let's just go! Are we going to be here all day? This is embarrassing... Dammit... What's that? Wait, hold up, but how? You're still classy AF. I can go play games. Can I come too? I learned to play the League. You're way too hip. Playing go or chess is more fitting to your age. No gramps play chess nowadays, they play StarCraft. Didn't have dinner yet? I... took these behind the chef's back. Taters! JMT! Jesus, Mucho Tasty? Jesus, Mucho Tasty. My Lovely Daughter Yeah. I see. Is something up? I'll game with you on another time. Dad... Mom's... You did your best raising our kids with nothing at all. I'll be with you shortly, so rest peacefully... We'll trust our friend to you, Lord. Allow us to live on with faith in you. We pray in your name, Lord. Amen. My deepest condolences. Will you be able to attend the Friday event? I have to. It's an important day. You haven't come to the hospital in a while. It's not even treatable, what's the use? These will help you manage your pain. Thank you. Will you really carry out the plan? My children all have their families, and my wife is resting peacefully. I've fulfilled my duties. There's no reason to wait any longer. Tumor probably worsened your dementia. Memories of those incidents are ingrained in my head. I just have to hang on until then. Ventilate for 30 minutes Open curtains in the day... Vitamins and Pills From daughter Regular pills Family Photo, 2010 Living Legend Chairman Jung Baek-jin Chairman Jung Admitted Again Prof. Yang: In Alliance with Japan Japan Self-Defense Forces Event in Korea Oldest Part-Timer Retiring After 17 Years Veteran of the Year My name is Han Pil-ju, I suffer from a brain tumor and Alzheimer's disease. I'm making this tape to record what I'm about to do. During the Japanese occupation, my father was framed and was arrested, and died after being tortured. Honey! Honey! No! Please! And my mother went mad until end of her days. My brother was deceived by his friend, and was forced to work in a hellish mine and lost his life. Lastly, my sister was taken as a comfort woman for the Japanese army, and committed suicide after her return home. From here on, I'll eliminate everyone who are connected to those events. I've been planning this for a very long time. Are you all right? I'm fine. Hey, Jason. Yes? I got something to tell you, could we step out for a bit? No, our break time is over, we have to go. It's chilly outside, you should talk in here. Okay. Thank you. Hey. Sorry for not attending the funeral, I heard about it too late. You like Lily, huh? What are you ta... She's just a friend... If you waste away your chance, someone will snatch her! She's super popular with guys. What a load of crap... I'm the popular one! You must be too old fashioned to notice, I stand 187 cm. I got a truck load of notes from girls. But is this what you wanted to talk to me about? Hey bro! I need your help. What's wrong? Is something up? I got a few places to visit, could you drive me around? Just like that? I returned my driver's license last year. My eyes are cloudy, and my body isn't what it used to be, so I can't drive. But you don't have a car. The thing is, I managed to get a really nice car. What about my job here? If I talk to the manager, you'll get a week off no problem. You know me, I got so much clout here. Yeah, indeed. Will you pay me for this job? Pending your performance. Your attitude changed now that you're an employer. Whoa, Freddie! It's yours?! Of course not, it's an unregistered car. I got it for a week. Unregistered? Wait, Freddie, did you spend all your pension to flex before you go? Shouldn't one ride a sports car before you die? I can't believe I get to drive a Porsche, this was in my bucket list. Bucket list? What's that? Things that you want to do before you kick the bucket and die. Bucket list? Sounds great. First stop, Gangnam Sungshin Medical Center. Gangnam, very good. Here we go then. Did you know? Porsche assisted the Nazis during World War 2. They sold military vehicles to them... That's Ford. Henry Ford. Is that so? I got confused because they sound similar. What's with your fingers? Did you get tattoos? Yeah. These are names of people I need to meet this week. They're like my bucket list. My memory's not the same. You could've just told me, tattoo's hard to erase... Sungshin Medical Center Park over there. Are you in bad shape? This is a huge hospital. No, I'm meeting someone here. How long will it take? It'll be a while, don't call even if it's late. I'll call you. He should still give me a rough estimate. He's an anal type. Authorized Personnel Only Escalator Undetectable Pardon me, may I take your seat? There are plenty of empty seats... He's an elderly, let him have the seat. Please have a seat. Thank you. Former councilman Jung Baek-jin blocked Wealth Recovery Act, which would've taken back wealth Chairman Jung Under Investigation from Japanese collaborators... I'll inject some vitamins for you. What was that? His vein is not easily found. Does that make sense to you? A nurse can't find a vein? For men of his age, it is difficult to find veins as they shrink in size. Are you lecturing me? Do I look like I want to hear your excuses? It's a matter of medical... Just apologize! Did you forget how? Apologize to Mrs. Jung. I'm sorry. Leave and send another nurse. Excuse me! Excuse me, sir? You can't sleep here. Where am I? Oh my, where could it be, it's the hospital. VIP Ward Elevator The chairman wakes up early, so have a soup and a fish dish ready. EXECUTION Freddie! You still haven't visited your friend? Why are you here? I told you to wait. I was in the internet café for 5 hours. You didn't answer my calls. Did you have dinner? I'm fine, you must be hungry, go on and eat. I sensed it earlier, your tone and mood have changed. Maybe it's weird seeing you outside of work. Wow, when was this... Don't touch that! Okay, I won't touch. Don't ever do anything that I didn't ask you. I understand. Don't be so anal because you're paying me. It's all for your own good. Don't wait up and just go home. It's late, let's head home together. He's an old friend, it could take a while. Head home first. The one who desired wealth. Who are you? Too much time has passed for you to remember. My father was a respected man in Yangju. As a tenant farmer, you framed and jailed him by mooching off the Japanese, and took everything from him. Then you assaulted him to death. Right in front of me. Han Yong-sik's second son, Pil-ju. Jung Baek-jin, it's time for you to die. Good day, sir. I was told that you were working last night... Time of death? Between midnight and 1, sir. What's that? A plastic bottle was likely used as a silencer. With cotton balls crammed in. We got a lunatic. Have you found the bullet? Yes, the forensic is analyzing it. Security cams? We checked the elevator, but no one came to this floor after his wife left. There're no cams in the VIP ward, due to privacy concerns. Wait, so the perp knew all that? Check all hospital cams. - Yes, sir! - Right away. Det. Kang! What is it? She witnessed a suspicious man last night in the lobby. I don't know if this will help, but I was working the graveyard shift... No, no, follow my order. Advance slowly. I'll go in first. Cover me from behind. Yeah, from behind. Targets ahead. Behind us! Come to the rear! Where? I can't see... Mission Failed I didn't see him! What the hell! You sure you're good? I told you to be careful. You said we should advance and fight! Go in after they kill each other. Using foes against each other! Forget it, what's done is done. Let's go again. Positioning was bad last time. That's enough, I have to go math academy now, all right? You little brat, don't mince words in English. Buddy, are you in grade school? Which grade? Hey! Buddy! Fuck-gyu, - got paid for the chauffeur gig? - $500 haha That's dope Coulda done it for free, but he wanted to pay me lol Did Jin-man call you? Didn't tell him I got discharged... - If he catches you, you're dead - Did you see this? Witness testimony and security cameras analysis pointed to a suspicious young man in the lobby at the time of Chairman Jung's murder. All evidence pins him as the prime suspect, and we're working to identify him. Freddie: Come to Moonye Library by 8. During World War 2, Japan was Asia's richest country, and had one of the world's Book Launch Lecture mightiest armies. They built ports and railroads right here in Korea. That was part of their colonization strategy, and it's hard to refute that it helped modernize our country. Your statement sounds like an excuse that supports Japan's colonization. Isn't it true that they exploited our country by force? Do we detest China because Yuan Dynasty ruled us? Do we curse them because the pirates plundered us? I simply believe that what's in the past is part of history. Taiwan, a country modernized by Japan, is still appreciative of Japan, History of Anti-Japanese Nationalist Sentiment is still appreciative of Japan, but we speak of slavery and comfort women, and continue to demonize them half a century after independence. Will you sacrifice the youths for the elders' revenge? There is no future for people stuck in the past. Why did you come here? You're not a regular reader. - Huh? - There, that car. Go follow that car. What about it? Someone you know? Don't follow right behind it, stay in the other lane. Keep about 2 cars between. I got something to talk about. We're almost there, we can talk then. Overtake that sedan and go straight. Have you seen the news? That hospital's chairman died. He was shot last night. The cops are looking for a young man, and I'm getting nervous for no reason. Did you see anyone suspicious while you were there? If you saw anyone like that, please tell me, so I can report him. Stay in the car no matter what. Where are you going? Hey! Thank you. Have a safe drive. Pardon me. So you're still ridiculing the world with your tongue. What? What do you mean? You knew... they wouldn't come back alive, and yet, you sold your bosom friends to the Japanese... Blinded by petty change... Who... who are you? You may not remember me, but you'll remember this name. My brother, who was lost and buried in a coal mine... Han Dong-ju. You crazy bastard... Yanagawa Yusuke! Dammit! National ID: Yang Sung-ik Get in! Come on, get in! Go on! There's a police station up ahead! Make a left there! Get it together and start the car! He's already dead! We have to get out of here! Shit! He wants us to wrap up and get back. Det. Kang! Yeah? We got the bullet analysis from the Jung Baek-jin murder. So? It was used by the Kwantung Army. Kwantung Army? During the Japanese colonial rule? Yes. In-gyu, it's time for dad's hospital visit! Shouldn't your guest have breakfast? No, he's in no shape for that. That doesn't seem right... Dad will catch cold, let's head down. Sure... Daehan Industries 10-Year Service Award Temperature will climb in the afternoon, with cold weather subsiding... The police briefing mentioned that the murder weapon was a gun. What do you make of that? In a gun-related crime, recovery of the bullet is crucial. The police have recovered a bullet from the victim's body. They've also seized security cams from the hospital, and are analyzing the footage. The suspect is said to be over 180 cm tall... Do you get it now? That's why I told you to stay put until I tell you. Are you saying this is all my fault? How did I become a suspect by coming up to the lobby?! Don't worry. Aside from the lobby, you couldn't have been filmed. And from that angle, they can't identify you. But how could... Even if my face doesn't show, that's still me! Let's go to the police and clear it up. I will, I'll go and turn myself in, but not yet. Whatever, I'll tell them myself. Will anyone believe that an 80-year-old man kill them? Even if they believe you, they won't think I acted alone, you'd become my accomplice. Wait... Pardon me for saying this, but are you out of your mind? After this is over, I'll testify that I forced you into this against your will. Were you always like this? Who are you, really? Are you really the Freddie I washed dishes with at TGI Fridays? Are you?! Yo, Fuck-gyu! I'm here, man! Buddy! Hey! Fuck-gyu! It's been a while. Does serving in the military dissolves your debt? If you didn't want to see me, you should've stayed there. You got discharged so long ago, asshole. Dude, you didn't hear yet? I got a job, I just have to work hard and pay you back. Shut the hell up, asshole. It's the truth! This gentleman is my boss. Are you kidding me? I'm so sorry. I'm begging you, you know my situation... Fuck you, man. How much did he borrow? $30,000, why? You'll pay it back for him? You got the goods? If you're not involved, stay out of it. You might get hurt and have a heart attack. Eh? What a geezer. Whatever, fuck shit up. Dude, please! Please! I'm begging you! What the hell? Old man, are you nuts?! Have you gone mad? Ow! Ow, my arm! I heard the older you get, the fearless you become. Aren't you old enough to crawl into a coffin? You could die for real! This should be enough to replace the window. I'll pay back his debt within a week. You grew old handsomely. Get me the money within this week. Or that bastard will fill the coffin before you. Okay? JIN Capital Choi Jin-man See you. Why did you get a private loan? To pay for my father's hospital bill. From student loan to living costs, I got so much to pay back! Do you still need to keep me around? I didn't know it'd end up like this. Despite our age difference, I thought we were best buds. Give me a little more time. I'm begging you. Shit... You will never let me go? Eastern Suwon Police Station In-gyu! Shut the door. What are you doing? Wait! Please! Freddie! Come on, wait! If you go in there, you'll be the killer of 3 seniors. Either rot in jail, or be a hostage of a killer, you decide. Freddie, is this really your best? Aiming a gun at your colleague, or threatening to kill yourself if something doesn't go your way? A week, give me a week. No harm will come your way. I promise. All right. Could you lower your gun so we can talk? Put that down! Christ... Open it. It's my life savings. I don't need it anymore. That's enough to cover your debt and hospital bills. Man... You kick me down but suddenly offer me a carrot? I'm really curious, let me ask you one thing. Why are you going this far? The men I killed murdered my entire family. None of them paid for their crimes and lived prosperously. Are you trying to justify your actions to me? This is more important than my life. Aiming for the emotional angle? So what? How many more will you kill? 3? 3 more? Holy shit! Why did I have to take the damn loan... I can't believe this... What the shit! Put your gun away. Could you put it away before I run in there, Freddie? All right, all right. Where is he going? Yang Sung-ik What is it? I found a ton of ID counterfeiters. They came up on online searches. Punish anti-social, pro-Japanese Kim Mu-jin! Punish! Punish! Punish! Daehan must compensate for Park Sang-taek's accident! Compensate! Compensate! Compensate! Hey, mom. What? Why did he go there? I said I'll take care of it! I can't believe it... What's going on? It's nothing. Your problem will be my problem. Spill it. My father went to... protest to get compensated for his industrial accident. Mom told me to go fetch him, but he's not the type to listen... Daehan's boss, that fucker... He's the real bastard! My father became a cripple by working for him, we didn't get a single cent and got kicked out! Damn... It's Kim Mu-jin! I told you to remove them, why're they still here? My apologies, sir, the police sent them away but... Don't make me say same thing twice. I'll get it done, sir. Push them back! Certificate of Merit Major General Dad! Hey. I have to talk to grandpa, could you play the piano later? Prof. Yang's funeral went well. Was it related to the chairman's murder? That's still being checked. Keep Yang's death a secret. It wouldn't look good when he finds out 2 guests are dead. Certainly. Hisashi-san? His flight arrives at 7 PM tomorrow. He'd like to meet you at the banquet. Does he not know the world has changed? One may be in a predicament when linked to Japan. This man is something else. Gen. Kim Chi-deok, he was a Defense minister. He was in textbooks as a war hero. Who's he? That's Tojo Hisashi, an executive advisor to Dasui Group, which deals with Daehan, but considering his stake, he's pretty much the owner. He was a captain of Japan's Self-Defense Forces. An incredible group of men... Attention! We're assigned to Japanese Embassy an important event tomorrow. What's the point of us going to a Japanese army celebration event? Tojo Hisashi I know, eh? We got some patriots here. No volunteers? - Chief? - Yeah? Choi and I'll take the detail. No way! You're on the shooter case. That's why I need to go. What? The 60th Japanese Army Celebration Event Two at that door, rest of you follow me. Invitation, please? I rushed to get here and forgot the invitation. I'm Yang Sung-ik. Could you check this? Your seat is at table B-3, sir. Thank you. Sir? May I check your bag? Please come this way. Over here. I'll quickly check your bag. It's best for quitting smoking. Sure. Don't drink too much coke, it's bad for your health. Gen. Kim is not in attendance? He's not feeling well, but he'd like to have dinner. He never puts himself in a compromised position. One can't hide his true self even after his role has changed. I'll go work at a shoe factory for a few months. Don't go, Ok-sun... I need to make money to buy you snacks and for you to attend school. Stand straight! Gunpowder... 1 and a half. Baking powder, 20g. Sir. You can't smoke in here. As I get older, I become fearless. Det. Kang, the event is starting. Yeah, I'll be right out. Even if we face insurmountable hardship, we will stand firm and head for the path to justice Even in the days of the Gods, we walked firmly, and marched to that place, the place where the empire shines Please be seated. We will now hear a celebratory speech from Capt. Tojo Hisashi, a retired MP officer. Let's welcome him warmly. Self-Defense Forces' 60-year history… Look into the man sitting in B-3. Hope of the Japanese people wanting peace in East Asia. Today's event will be the start of eradication of the Post-war Constitution, which will allow our nation to start a war at any time. Det. Kang, we got a situation! B-3's Yanagawa Yusuke is the deceased Yang Sung-ik. What are you saying? I confirmed it myself. There, the man wearing a fedora! Move, move! Everyone out! Dammit, move out of the way! Where is he? Shit... I'll escort you out, this way! Over here! Please come this way! Let's go! Stop. This is the gun that killed Jung and Yang. Move. Open this door! The one who violated my sister. Do you even know who I am?! You are aiming that gun at the Japanese empire. Cell phone! Peace with North Korea is great. But from my experience, communism is scarier than imperialism. More Koreans have die in the Korean War than the colonial period. The Japanese rule is in the past, and North Korea's missile threat is the present. One must identify friends and foes properly. Tojo Hisashi Move! Tojo-san, did the event go well? No matter how much one lived, you always fear death. Tojo Hisashi will now die. You're… Next. Stop right there! Stop! - Search the lobby! - Yes, sir! Die, Korean bastard… Don't kill me… Please… Don't... Seal the hotel lobby! Lock it all down! Freddie Hello? What are you up to? You'll see paramedics in front of the hotel. What? So what? What do you want me to do? Tell them there's a patient on the 4th floor. Wait, why are you coughing? Freddie? Hello? Where exactly is the patient? 4th floor staff hallway! Then let's go that way! We are locking down the hotel! No one's allowed out without our permission! Initiate lockdown! We're so fucked... Make a right, over there! This is the police, calm down! Where the hell is he? Wait a minute! Freddie! Freddie! What's wrong?! Are you okay? - Do something fast! - One moment. Holy shit! Thank you. Come with me! Crouch down! Down! Move! Make way! EMT! Stop! Move! Move! Stop right there! Out of the way! Stop that paramedic! Hurry! Come on! Stop that man! I'm a cop, I'm a cop! Out of the way! Dammit! Shit... Freddie, get in! Both of you! Stop! Stop! Man, that was close... We made it in the nick of time. Anyway, so where do we go now? What the... Freddie! Freddie! Wake up! You can't stir up all the trouble and force me to clean up! Think... Wait a minute, his pills... What the heck? Yangju Clinic Christ! I don't believe this! We'll get to the killer first. I'll take full responsibility for this incident. I'm sorry about disturbing you. Yes, sir. Press? The Japanese embassy put an embargo on it. The press is in the dark on this. When the reporters go mad, there's no way to contain it. It'll break our deals with Dasui. We have to find him first and clean up the situation. Yes, I'll take care of it. We need professionals to do the job like this. They're men from my brigade. The general filled us in. Just do what these guys say. Of course. We'll be in touch. General. Yangju Clinic That boy brought you in. Even when I'm gone, look after him. He's a good kid. You're in bad shape. Couldn't you stop at this point? I have killed men... You don't know what that means. Money or not, this is wrong. I don't care what happens, I'm just gonna go home. All right. My greed became too much of a burden for you. You came to your senses after a nap? With that, I'm gonna head home then. Help me one last time? Are you doing a good deed? What is it now? Stop asking people for things they're incapable of. It's not about shooting, so don't worry. It's late, let's go home in the morning, okay? Man... The Chairman Jung Baek-jin Murder Report Japan SDF Event Embargo Orders Yes, hello? What's that? Commissioner Park tells me that you are the lead investigator. Good to meet you, I'm Kim Chi-deok. Major Crimes, It. Kang Young-sik, sir. Security here is something. When you get to my age, there are more foes than friends. - Come sit down. - Sure. Your eyes are filled with questions. Chairman Jung Baek-jin and Prof. Yang Sung-ik were Korea-Japan Forum members, Tojo Hisashi was the Japanese advisor, and you were the Korean advisor. All four of you became acquainted during the Japanese rule in Yangju. You know who is behind these incidents, right? You're straight as an arrow. If I knew that, I wouldn't be meeting someone of your rank. I see. Pro-Japanese National Biography Please take a look at this. Kim Chi-deok Manchurian Forces Captain Jung Baek-jin, Yang Sung-ik, and Tojo Hisashi, I killed them all. These cases must be related to this. What exactly happened back then? Det. Kang! All right. To your generation, that era feels like a big deal. Far from it! We were simply living the days. And my next target is... former army Chief of Staff, so-called hero of the Korean War, Gen. Kim Chi-deok. Back then, Koreans were poor, powerless and discouraged. Everyone's only goal was survival, not value of life! To achieve wealth and honor, he sided with the Japanese and led countless Koreans to death, and destroyed my family. 'Independence' felt like an idealist's nonsense, and we had to accept that Korea as a country ceased to exist! Did we achieve independence on our own? No. 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man' got us our independence. Even as a Japanese collaborator and a traitor of his own country, Kim Chi-deok never received any punishment and lives on as a politician and a hero in the modern society. I fought with my life for our country's modernization, and protected Korea! That Taeguk Order of Military Merit proves that. He earned his medals on his chest with blood of others, and his wealth and honor were earned with others' pain and screams. If you cannot read the flow of the time, you'll fall behind. It's illogical to talk about justice when one can't protect his family. You summoned me to tell me that? Lastly, the man who stood and watched it all, Kiyohara Takayoshi. With him as my last target, I'll end my revenge. How was the hotel? It's clean, there's nothing. How did you sweep that place? Does it make sense that nothing came up?! I'm sorry, sir. Call chief right away and request SWAT! SWAT? Just ask him! I think the perp will kill one more man. I'll be arrested in the morning. And nothing bad will happen to you. I'll make sure of it. Just go back to the life you had before. You paid me enough for the gig, let me give you one last gift. Why are you standing around? Pick one. It must be nice getting a present from your grandson. Yes. Hold up... Stop, stop. Isn't that the car from the Seoul APB notice? Come on, man. Have you seen a sports car around here? It does feel out of place. Yeah, go ahead. Sir, the suspect's car has been spotted in Yangju. What? What's the exact location? Yangju city bus terminal. City bus terminal, okay, got it. Go. What a crazy bastard. They came out, look. Whoa, you look at least 10 years younger. I'll only get to wear it for a day, but thank you. I'll put your old clothes in the car. I'm gonna take the bus. You know how to drive? Not getting in? Wait a minute. Where are they going? Go, go after them! Yes, sir! Looking for something? Can't you fill me in so I can stay or not... Jesus Christ... Are you listening to me? Butterfly Coffee Shop It's sad to see you go, let's have some tea. What? There was a tea shop by the car... He's stubborn till the end. There, park in front. Okay. Welcome. 1 ice coffee, please. Sure. Why did you order just one? I'm thirsty too. Pull out a $50 bill. Why should I? I'm literally penniless, I gave you everything. Till the end... Here's your coffee. Here, keep the change. Thank you, baby. Wait, hold on... That's my money now, if someone's going to show off, I should be the one. And you order just yours... What the... What in the world?! We're exposed. Move in, let's go. Wait a minute, they're armed. Damn, no other exits? Nope. Let's get up there. Freeze! Oh my! Where's the old man who was here? He just left... No way, no one came down! Hey! Let them off and bring it up again! - Here you go. - Thank you! Shit! What are you doing? Come on! Whatever! - Bring the car! - Okay! Stop right there! Stop! Hey! Goddamn! - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Shit... Damn... It doesn't feel right. When you get to Seoul, head straight home. Don't worry. I won't even look back. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine... Lock the doors. - Lock the doors! - What? Come with us. Please verify. Did you find anything? On August 24, 1942 before the independence, Kim Chi-deok volunteered for the Japanese MP, changed his name and swore allegiance to the emperor. According to this document, up until the independence in 1945, he enlisted 152 girls as comfort women and forced over 300 young men to fight in the Pacific campaign. Under the Japanese rule... This is why you killed them? You crazy old fart? Get with the times, who cares about pro-Japanese sentiment? No more chitchat, get rid of them. I'm really sorry! I sincerely apologize! Please don't kill me! Please! We can't die like this! Do something, please! Let the kid go. His only crime is following me around. He doesn't know anything. What's with the bullshit? Go on, let's wrap this up. Tape! I made a copy! A copy? We made a copy just in case! What do you mean? I left it with someone so nothing happens to me. If we don't show up in time, it'll be sent to the police and media! The one keeping the copy is in desperate need of money... I'll check it out. He came. We got a customer. Yo, Fuck-gyu! You came here yourself? Where's the old fart who's bringing the money? And who's this here? - Give it back. - What? What the old man gave you, give it back. Are you nuts? I told you to bring... If you want the money, give it back first! You son of a bitch! Electricity bill here is $40,000 a month. Tell me again, you want what for my money? You fucking prick, are you nuts? Motherfucker! Goddamn, fuck them up! Son of a bitch! Where are you going?! Where is it? Under the table... Did you find it? Yes, confirm it. What's this? There's no tape! What do you mean? Why are you looking for a tape here? Motherfuckers! Please don't kill me... Don't kill me! I should've pulled the trigger back there. Anyone can come up with a plan before the beating. So there never was a copy? Daehan must really be a Japanese company, can't you understand Korean? Stupid bastard. - You turned my father into a cripple! - Let go of me! Let go! Let go of me! You bastard! How did you know I was here? JIN Capital I cleaned up this place. This is way better than your booby trap, using foes against each other. I should never have brought you into this. Why are you looking at me like that? It's too late. I'm all right. Someone probably heard the gunshot, police will be here. I caused all of this, and you end up this way because of me. Thank you for everything, Jason. Stay still, it'll be over soon. - Hey. - Yes? You've seen me before, right? It's really dangerous walking here alone. You must've been in a bad accident. Thank you for picking me up. Where do you live? We'll drive you back. I have to meet someone. Where is the meeting place? I can't remember... What should we do? Is this Chinese? She started learning Chinese. It seems to be all the rage nowadays. It's Japanese. Characters are the same as Chinese. How do you read it? I have to kill him. Kaneyama Shinichi Kaneyama Shinichi? Sounds like an animation villain. Everyone! Chosun does not exist anymore. I stand before you as a Japanese military police, branch manager of the Chosun Youth Federation. My name is Kaneyama Shinichi. I remember where I was going. Is master sergeant not coming? He might not make it, he's been through a lot. Gen. Kim Chi-deok Statue Unveiling Okay, I understand. General, Sgt. Kim is unreachable. You should cancel this event... It's for my statue unveiling. Even if everyone's gone, I have to be here. Of course, sir. My granddaughter is here. Keep me safe. Flags, up! Please be seated. Salute! We thought you wouldn't make it. Was it tough getting here? It wasn't easy getting this far. We'll now begin the unveiling of Gen. Kim Chi-deok's statue. Please step forward and stand on both sides. One, two, three! Pull the ropes! We will now hear Gen. Kim's commemorative speech. Early morning of August 15, 1952. My aide-de-camp It. Park Hee-su said to me as he looked at the highlands in front of us, "Let's defeat our foes and raise our flag at the summit!" We advanced and won. But when we raised our flag at the summit, It. Park wasn't there. Half of the men I served with lost their lives by our enemy's bullets. For our country, for our people, to protect democracy, my men and I fought against communism and the Chinese army! It is now time to subjugate! Rise, youths of the peninsula! This is not a ceremony to celebrate me alone. It is a somber order from the country to remember blood and sweat of the fallen! We must spill our enemy's blood to immortalize the Japanese empire! Those who came after us must never forget! Whose blood was spilled for the freedom you enjoy! Hooray to the Great Empire! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray to the Emperor! Hooray! Hooray! Please be seated. Thank you for your inspiring speech. General, please remain at the podium... Please return to your seat. I'm warning you, please return. We'll now award this year's honorable veterans. - From the Marine 2nd Brigade... - Get back, asshole. Fulfilled his duty as a soldier in the Vietnam War, and despite being over 80 years old, he has maintained his job for 10 years straight, and received a full coverage in a newspaper. Master Sgt. Han Pil-ju, please step forward. Han Pil-ju May I? My apologies, sir. Chairman of the Veteran Association, Gen. Kim Chi-deok will present the medal. This award is given to veterans who were exemplary citizens. Thank you for your work. I've done many things to get here. That's an old gun. The one who deceived. You look familiar. You don't remember me? How dare you put a gun to an army general's face? Who are you?! Han Ok-sun. That's my sister's name. Don't remember that name too? I'll help you remember then. Do I look like someone who fears death? What are you doing?! Your man better put away his gun. Lower your gun! Now! Tell us what you did to my sister. If you tell the truth, your granddaughter will live. You are insane! She's a child who doesn't know anything! You know how many people I killed. I'll count to three. - One! - Stop... - Two! - Stop it! - Grandpa! - Three! Stop, Han Pil-ju! I know what you want to hear from me. So please stop! Now you remember? Tojo Hisashi came and said, village women must be sent to the war as per general mobilization order. I told him they could not be forced into being comfort women. No one would've volunteered if 'comfort women' was mentioned, so we had to lie that it was for a factory job in Japan. The first person who enlisted at the news of making money was Ok-sun. She was your fiancée... She trusted you and relied on you. People told her not to believe you, but she did because it was you. Without someone's sacrifice, no one would've survived. You lived through that, you know better. If you were so proud of it, you wouldn't have hid it. Tell everyone here who you were. Without a hint of lie. All right, I'll tell you what you want to hear. I worked as an assistant to Japanese MP, and led the name change policy, and locked up anyone who spoke Korean. I encouraged local youths to fight for the Japanese empire, and coerced women to become comfort women. You're right, Han Pil-ju, I'm a Japanese collaborator! You survived that period, because you weren't all that different from me! For that child to live in a just world, repent with your death. Let's meet again in hell. Han Pil-ju, drop your gun and surrender! I repeat! Drop your gun and surrender! Is Kim Chi-deok dead? Yes. He's armed, he's armed. Something's off. He wouldn't get caught like this. He's still a senior. SWAT has surrounded him. He can't run. There's one more person to kill. What do you mean? Kiyohara... Kiyohara... We have to hurry. What's going on?! I figured out who the last target is! I repeat, drop your gun and surrender! No sudden moves! Drop your gun! Drop it! Drop it, Han Pil-ju! What are you wearing? I volunteered for the Kwantung army. What? I'm leaving for Manchurian tomorrow. Don't you know... what the Japanese bastards did to me there? And yet, you'll go there? Wearing the same uniform? The living must go on living! I can't live being a victim like you. Are you... ashamed of me? I'm not even curious what happened to you. I don't care! I just want to live my life! Han Pil-ju! Stop calling me that name! Han Pil-ju is gone... From here on… I'm Kiyohara Takayoshi. The one who stood by... Kiyohara Takayoshi. You must… Die now. No, Freddie! You said criminals must be punished! That's why you did this! You can't die here like this. If you do... everything you did becomes meaningless. This is none of your concern. You said those who commit crimes must be punished! You did this for the injustice in this world! I... I committed too many crimes. I must pull this trigger. Stop being so weak! Freddie... Everyone will die. Don't act like you did something so special! If you must be punished, then stand in trial confidently. Don't use death to flee from this like a coward. That's... the right way. Ministry of Patriots and Veteran Affairs stated that they will refuse Gen. Kim Chi-deok's burial at the National Cemetery, as former Japanese collaborators cannot have the burial privilege. When was this planned? After the Korean War, he wanted to kill Kim and himself at Kim Chi-deok's car parade in Yangju. But he found out that day his wife was pregnant. That night, he buried his gun. He realized that he had a family he was responsible for. Freddie... Do you remember me? Can you recognize me? I sent you some money. The limit was $3,000, so I could only put in that much. So don't just eat the food here, buy some snack too. I'm really nice, right? Yes. There are many nice people in the world. My sister is very nice, and so is my brother. Freddie, you really don't remember me? You don't remember anything? This is just my thought, even though you did something really bad, but you're not a bad person. I came here to tell you that. 3820, your visitation time's up. Be kind. Freddie. I'll come back soon. Always be healthy. Okay?
