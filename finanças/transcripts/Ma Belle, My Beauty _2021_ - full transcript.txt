I'm sorry, one more time. The two extra beats. I hate this song, sorry. What? The song? Come on, listen. ♪ Tell me you love me ♪ ♪ Two extra beats And then we go ♪ - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Let's do it again. Okay. Actually give me, give me one second. - Yeah sure, sure. - My head is killing me. Fred? Fred! There's a leak, Madame. Oh, dear. You know... a leak? It's leaking? Yes! That's it. The pool is leaking? So, you see, they made a mistake with the pipes. The small one should be on the other side. The big one in the front. That's actually why it doesn't work. This valve should be on the other side. So just tell your husband, Mr. Frédéric, I'm going to need to dig up this whole area. I might be a little more expensive. But at least it will work! Cheers. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. You okay? What if she doesn't want to see me? She loves surprises. She hates surprises. You'll be fine. I'll be back tonight. Wait, you're not coming in? I have a gig in town I have to do. Hey, did I mention I'm happy you're here? Get outta here. Make yourself at home, okay? Play well. Hello, Madam. Oh, shit. I usually have coffee, but you're here, so. You look great, Bert. It's the sun. I do not miss that New Orleans humidity. Cheers. Nice house. Mm. Yeah, right. High maintenance though. The plumber was just here for like four hours. What's with the tiny windows? They used to keep silkworms up there in the attic. I don't know much else. So you moved back to New Orleans, huh? Mm-hmm. About a year ago. Hmm. You still dating Cody, Yoni, what was her name? Klobe. I knew that woman was crazy. I know. And you guys got married. We did. Okay. Might have to clear some stuff out of there, so... Is this okay? Yeah. How long are you staying? Probably just the weekend. I know you guys have your tour. Uh, so I was thinking of heading to Spain. There's clean sheets in there if you like. It's market day today in town, if you want to go. Later, with me. Right. Mm... OK. It's-it's... It's spicy? Mm... ...over. Can you smell them? Oh, this is... this is it. What are these called? Mirabelles. They're yummy. So it sounds like you guys are kind of famous around here, yeah? What did Fred tell you? Nothing. What? He's been working on this big tour all year... Mm-hmm. ...with a bunch of "international musicians". He got some funding from Switzerland or something. Yeah, that sounds pretty big. Yeah. I don't want to go. Your husband's concert last week was really extraordinary. It really moved me. It reminded me of Django! So many memories. - Ah. - Oui. I won't tell you about them, because if I did... - Bonjour. - Bonjour. This is my friend. My name is Lane. - Lovely to meet you. - Lovely to meet you. - Do you come from New Orleans too? - Yes, Madame. What a dream. Louis Armstrong. "What A Wonderful World"! I'm obsessed! I just love it. Well, I have to go find Philippe. Hope to see you again soon, ladies. Au revoir. Damn, Bert, your French is horrible. So when was the last time you performed? About six months. Actually it was eight months ago. The soundtrack to my dreams is Fred playing arpeggios. He's on all the time. Well, he's kind of always been like that, Bert. Yeah, but in New Orleans it was cute. He was catching up. And here it's like, we have these gigs and it's "Fred Carnot's band and his wife on vocals". I'm sorry, I cannot get over that wife thing. Do they really say that? Yeah, sometimes. ...and it's, oh my God, it smells so good. Hey, here are my girls. Hey. You okay, ma belle? Mm-hmm. Good surprise, right? We'll talk about that later. This one first, then this one, then that one. You sure not the Duché d'Uzès first? Who's coming? Well, it was going to be just Pierre because, well, Pierre has been asking to meet Lane for years, but then I ran in to Madame Dubois at the gig and I had to invite her and Robert. Ugh. Babe, I know but look, Lane is here, so it's gonna be fun, right? Why didn't you call me? We would have stayed out. Well, I assumed you'd want to be here to show Lane off. We got shallots. Oh, great. And ginger? Nope. Shit, I forgot the ginger. Okay, it's okay, babe. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. It's going to be ginger beef without ginger. End of the story. Think I'm gonna shower. It doesn't matter, babe. Did you have a good day with Lane? What is she doing here? You invited her, didn't you? I'm not getting back with her. You know that, right? That is just not gonna happen. Salty. Yeah? Shit. Mm-hmm. Mm. And on top of all that she told me she is pregnant! That's not true. Si. Yes, it is. Well actually... I heard a little something about your relations with the mayor's daughter. - No, that's all nonsense. - The mayor's daughter? I saw you once. Oh, really? Bertie? Bertie? Oh, hey, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. They're talking about very boring things. How are you? I'm fine. Are you happy to see Lane? Yes. But I don't remember her from the wedding. No. She couldn't make it. Wait, wait, wait. One second. Thank you. Oh, wait, Lane. Here you go. Your friend here speaks French very well. Yes, she's very gifted. Bertie! Bertie! Enchante! What? Nothing, I'm going to bed. Okay. Goodnight. Night, Bert. Did you bring those pills? Oh, yeah. Is she still not sleeping? I don't know. She doesn't tell me anymore. Since when is she into pills? You know, you kinda brought her out of her element here. She wanted to get out of New Orleans. That was the whole point. Come, go on tour, make money, get famous. People go crazy for her here. And now all I can hear is, "This music is bad. Tell them I can't come." For six months it's been like this. It made me look really, really unprofessional. Fred. I know, okay, sorry, okay. It's just... it's been difficult. Why didn't she call me when her mom died? Why didn't you call me? She forbid me to. I should have been there. I know. I needed you. I would have been there for her, not for you. Well, if you had kept in touch, you would have known. Honestly, Lane, I don't know what happened. Bertie was wrecked. But, hey... the way you two do your things is none of my business. You're right. It's not. Gerard, I already told you not Saturday mornings, please! How many miles did you do? I lost count. Is the water supposed to be this low? The pool is leaking. The grapes are kind of weird. They're wine grapes. So? They're not supposed to be sweet. Lane, Lane, don't you dare! Didn't you read this one already? Jane Eyre? I read that one like 12 times. You really do love a prince charming fairytale, don't you? That makes sense. What are you doing here, Lane? Came to check out this fancy new life of yours. To make sure you're okay. So you disappear, never call, and after two years later you just show up to see if I'm okay? Bert, I tried to get in touch when I found out about your mom. Yeah, well, I was busy with the wedding and all. So what? You guys got married so you could come live in France? Actually, I just wanted us to get married. Seemed like the right time, like it made sense. I didn't think I needed to talk to you about it. You'd been gone for so long. Yeah, well. You were gonna get married whether I was around or not, right? It looks like rehearsal's over. I'm gonna go make lunch. He called you, didn't he? When did he call? A couple of weeks ago. Can't believe he did that. Come on, Bert, you have a husband who cares about you. Be happy. Okay, so I'll call him tomorrow and he will come and fix it himself, right? Yes, Dad, I am trying. Why don't we just wait for you to come back and deal with it. Yes, Mom, I'm fine. I'm not getting angry. Yes, Mom, everything is good. Yes, she's fine. Madame Dubois says hello. Yes, Mom, I'm taking care of it. All right, hugs, see you, Dad. See you later. Can I see pictures of the wedding? I mean you did, you did take pictures of the wedding, right? Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course, yeah. My friend Mahmoud was the photographer. Not being on Instagram means I miss out on a lot of stuff. Got some on my phone, actually. Great. Let me just check. Here you go. Here you go. That was on the way to city hall. It was actually really rainy so we didn't get to have a ton of outside pictures but these ones are great. Hmm. Joanne was there? Yes. She was Bertie's maid of honor. Oh. Oh, and you had a second line. Yes. - Really cool, that's great. - That was really fun. Awesome. Cool, yeah, that's great. That's all I got in here, but I can show you the rest later. Yeah, I'd love to. So what do you guys want to do today? We can go for a ride, for a hike. We can go to my friend's winery. This is his wine actually. I think I gotta go back to bed. Oh. Jet leg killing you? Yeah, I'm just not feeling it all of a sudden. Okay. Well, I need to practice anyway. Actually, tonight there's a party. It's Valerie's birthday. Oh, really? Yeah. Lane, you're going to love it. Like a lot of great people, really nice, calm and intimate. We usually end up playing. Maybe a good chance for you to get back into a couple of songs, babe. Maybe. Babe, it's going to get harder if you don't push through. And plus this is the best environment to practice in. People are going to get drunk and have fun. Don't push yourself if it's not gonna feel good. So there's this massage therapy training program in Barcelona and I think I'm going to do it. So, Fred, I could really use your help writing to the instructor, kind of talk about my plans. Massage therapy? Mm-hmm. You know, it's just like something I really wanna do. I can do it anywhere. And I'm sick of trying to work for other people. It seems kind of random. Couldn't you find something like that to do around here? And when does it start? I was thinking next week, but, you know, it's actually kind of flexible. It's just like with this woman in her house, so. What? Did I wake you? Mm-mm. Did Fred tell you to bring those? Mm-hmm. My God, he's so worried. Should he not be? Pills is not what I need, nor what I want. Did Fred go out? He's at a rehearsal. Lane. Lane, Lane. She was lucky, she had done movies before. Well, let's not exaggerate. Yes, it's true! No, no, no. Yes, well, it was us. Our concerts were the best. What? - You can say it. - All right, all right. Without a problem, you can say it. Are you all having a good time? Just goofing around. As usual. Marianne, if you don't mind could you start with the bathroom upstairs? No problem at all. I'll get started. - See you later. - Merci. Hey. How are you? - I'm good. And you? - I'm good. And your Grandma? She is not good at all. It is what it is. So haven't you left for your tour yet? Wednesday. Since when have you been working here? It's been a while. They're kind. How's Bertie? She's better. Our ex came to see us. Always the same story with you. Aren't you tired of being surrounded by all these women? You need to concentrate, Mr. Carnot. Isn't all that a distraction? No, on the contrary. So, you don't need a new singer for your tour anymore, right? Since she's better. I'm ready to go. Oh, hey, good choice. Shall we? Let's go. Are you sure? That was when... Man, I cannot understand anything some of these people are saying. I thought my French was good, but I don't know what is going on here. Yeah, they're super southern. It's crazy. Look, about earlier... My bad. I mean, you're married now, right? That'd be like adultery. You know that's illegal in some countries? Well, I guess the same countries where being gay is illegal. So we'd be screwed either way. Yeah, well, France, isn't one of those countries. Fair point. And so we're clear, it has nothing to do with me being married. I got it. Who's that? Oh, that's Noa, she's from Israel. Really? She was in the army for, like, a few years. Like how many? How many? I don't know. But longer than she had to be. How was your anti-occupation work going by the way? Are you still boycotting that brand of hummus? Are you not still boycotting that brand of hummus? The French aren't into hummus. But there's this fish dip thing that they eat a lot. Oh, I forgot... I forgot what it's called. It's so good though. Oh, God. - What's wrong, Bert? - You're doing that thing. What thing? With your eyes, stop it. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you going to pick a fight with her? Please don't get all political on me. No, she's cute. I might learn a thing or two. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Noa. - Bertie. - How are ya? - How are you? Hey, and you are, the bartender? - I can be. - Yeah? What are you drinking? I take whisky. All right. So you're back from Israel? Yeah, yeah, my brother married a French guy, and then Valerie just said I could come, stay here for the rest of the summer. Just work on some paintings. - Okay. - I promised myself I won't get too drunk tonight like last year though. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. Last summer at Valerie's party I got, I got a little too crazy and Bertie here saved my life. She's good at that. - Yeah. - Here. Thanks. I'm Noa. Lane. You guys seen Valerie's new car yet? No. She got another one? Damn. I know. You wanna drive? Can't drive stick. Americans. You all drive stick in Israel? Some of us do. Learning something already. There's only two seats. Guess I'll see you both later. Sure this is fine? Yeah, get in.

Hey. Great. Are you a dog or cat? I'm told I'm a snake. You're a dog, definitely. Yeah, I always come when I'm called. That's a good quality. Don't lose that. Nah, I wanna lose it. I hate how available I am. And we dogs are very vulnerable to snakes. I imagine Bertie is not someone who comes when called. No, ma'am, Bertie says where and Bertie says when. So when you were all together... Mm-hmm. - Were you and Fred? - No. We were friends forever, but you know. I can't imagine having two partners. It just... It sounds like a lot of work. Bertie was good at it. And you? Were you always fine sharing her with Fred? It could be challenging. I guess it's just like, how could you not love someone who loves the person you love? You know? I guess. I mean, I tell my girlfriend she can do whatever she wants with guys but that's because men are obsolete. True. In Tel Aviv, we call men a dildo a with a pulse. But then these two got married last year. Yeah, that was not part of the plan. Thank you. I'm doing what I can, alright? But I already told you I'm not going to do it like that. I'm not asking you to force her. But you told me at the beginning that there would be no problem. And I already cancelled all my stuff. Well, you shouldn't have. I didn't tell you to cancel anything. Are you serious? This is really not cool. If you bring your wife into a band, it's your responsibility to manage her. Never get married. Sorry, one... one second. No, no, I don't. Who would allow you to do that? Oh, okay. Okay, all right. Can I talk to you for a sec? Sure. What's up? I think I'm going to bring Noa back to the house tonight. What about the... soldier thing? I don't know, she's cool. We're not gonna talk about it. Bertie, you sounded so wonderful. Thank you, Pierre. No, really. I really missed your voice. We've been sounding really bad. Oh, come on now. We missed you at rehearsal yesterday. I had some things to take care of, so. I hope you'll consider singing with us again for the tour. Seriously? Fine. - Hey, babe, let's go home. - Mm. Let's go. Okay. See you later. Oh, you're staying? Just for a little bit. - Well, maybe I'll stay a bit too. - No, no, no. We're going home, let's go. Fred. You're different when Lane's here. You like to impress her. It's nice. Do you wish I did that more for you? You used to do that for me. But never for me like you do for her. I hate you for bringing her here without asking me. Come on, Bertie. You're happy to see her again. Look at you tonight. Don't tell me what I'm feeling, Fred. And what, you want her to move in and stay here? Why not? Don't we have more fun when she's around? Come on, Fred. What would she even do here? Be a massage therapist apparently. Massage. Massage. Is this Noa? Wow. Let me see those sleeping pills, babe. I can't believe you told her to bring me those. Yeah, well, if you don't mind... I'm gonna take one. Are you serious? Oh, yeah. - Can I? - Yes. Hey. Hey. - Good morning. - Good morning. Coffee? Yes, please. This house is amazing. Thank you, it's my parents'. Have some breakfast. You guys had fun at the party last night? Oh, yeah. Valerie's parties are the highlight of every summer. Mm-hmm. For me too. And you sounded amazing last night. Thank you. When are you going back to Israel? In a few days. I'm super bummed though, there's that local festival with the bulls and the swimming pool happening next weekend. Really wanted to go. You like those? Yeah, it's super funny. I can't stand those things. Why? All those crazy animals. Could kill all those kids. Isn't that the point? Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. Hi. You guys sleep okay? Yeah. Very well. Like a rock. Yeah, me too. Think I'm finally getting over that jet lag. I love that you don't have air conditioning. I keep begging Valerie to turn hers off all summer. Oh, yeah? You like to sweat? I like sweating when I sleep. Hmm. Me too. I guess we were sweating a lot last night. You're a Saints fan? I'm a science fan? Saints, do you, are you a fan? - It's your shirt. - Oh, yeah, big one. So me and Fred, we were just talking about going to the river today. Yes? You wanna come? I'd love to, I don't wanna intrude though. No please, come. Our car has four seats. Yeah, yeah. We should go. - All right. - Yeah, we should. - Babe, can you hand me some of that? - I got it. Cool. So how old is Noa anyway? Like 25? Probably. And? Nothing. You just usually like them older. She spoke Hebrew to me while we were having sex. Really? It messed me up, I was super into it. Damn. I know. Yeah, soccer is very popular. - You wanna get my back? - Mm-hmm. Are you really serious about this massage therapy thing? I think so. You sure it's not an excuse for you to keep touching people all the time? Whatever. All right, well, let's see what you got. Okay. Did you see that... Damn, I'm not gonna lie. I miss having sex with women. Ouch! So what, there's no queers around here? No, and if there are, I don't know where they're hiding. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. How's the water? Fucking freezing. How's the massage going? Yeah, she's all right. Needs a little work. Fuck you. What, I'm just kidding. You were great. Can I try? You know I'm not gonna say no. Oh. They teach you this in army? Oh, yeah. I got so good I could ask whatever I wanted from anyone. Oh, I bet you could. What kind of things you trade for? Uh, depended I guess. Sometimes a favor, sometimes just cleaning my gun. Oh. You ever trade it for sex? No, never needed to trade for sex. Did you even get horny during all that army time? Like all that violence, isn't that a turn off? Bertie, come on. What, I'm interested. No, you're not. Yes, I am. You should get yourself a massage therapist. You're really tight. Sorry. It's okay. Hey. Hey. Come dance with me. - Lane. - Hmm. What are you doing? What do you mean what am I doing? I thought you came here to figure things out with Bertie. I did. Right, so you're just doing it the Lane way? Do you think I should be getting down on my knees and begging her to take me back? Don't you think you owe her that? No, I don't. And if you really think that's the way to get Bertie's attention, then I really wonder if you even know her at all. Look, stop fucking around. Do you think this is fun for me? Well, that's you, just thinking about having fun. When are you going to take things seriously? You want me to come move to France and play happy family with you guys? Do you still love her? Do you? You know that her career is the most important thing to her. More important than either of us has ever been. And she hasn't sung like she sung last night. Since you left. And I know I'll never have that effect on her. This really is all about your tour. Isn't it? Merci! Merci! Excusez moi! Excusez moi. What'd you get? Some fish, I'm going to cook tonight. Catfish? No, similar. They don't have catfish here but similar. All right. Doesn't Fred hate the catfish though? He has a gig tonight. Can I invite Noa? No, nope, no, just, yup, kidding. Oof. Okay. Do you want me to stay? Because I could go. If you don't, I could go tomorrow. Lane, you disappeared. With no explanation. How could you do that? And now you're back, again with no explanation. Sitting here trying to get me to tell you what to do. Do you want me to just love up on you? Like I used to? Just because you came back? I don't know what Fred has been telling you, but my happiness is not tied to you and it's not tied to him. If you want to stay, fine. Great, we'll see how it goes. But if you want to go fuck around in Madrid, you can do that too. And that'd be fine with me too. I don't care. I... I don't have the space to care. You don't have to hold everything on your own. There's two of us here who care about you, who love you, who are willing to catch you if you would just let us. What the hell happened in your life that made you wind up here trying to get back into mine? Because that's what you do, right? You get up, set shit on fire and find another creek to fish in. I know I have my fair share of troubles. But I don't drag people through my shit like you do. Drag me, Bert. Fucking drag me, I want you to. I'm here to walk through your shit with you. And the way you do that is by bringing a girl over that you just met and fucking her in my house? The day after you get here. Well, there was a time that would entice you. I guess not anymore, hmm? Well, you know me, Bert. Setting shit on fire as always. Thank you for the fish, it was delicious. Can I? Yes. Close the door. Got you. This twist. Lane? Lane? Lane? Bertie? - Hey. - Hey. The guys are almost here. Okay, I'm just making some rehearsal snacks. Oh, thank you, thanks. You're welcome, you're welcome. You good? Mm-hmm! Where's Lane? I don't know, I think she went for a run or something. Okay. I'm gonna join you guys. Noa! You want to stop? Rest for a minute? I hate what she does to me, I can't even remember what road I turned on to. It's kinda cute. Yeah, right. Why do you let yourself get this way? You don't have to be here. I don't know. Obsession? Addiction. Beginning the intro... and then you can come... come in more... Yeah. So yeah, all this is the same. Where the hell have you been? What happened? Got lost. Ended up at some castle. - The ruins? - Mm. Lane, that's far as fuck. One second. I'm tired. Yeah, no kidding. No. I want you to want me. I do want you, Lane. I want all of it. All of you. I don't think you do. I have to go on this tour. I'm going on this tour. I know. But maybe after. You're just gonna leave me again, aren't you?
