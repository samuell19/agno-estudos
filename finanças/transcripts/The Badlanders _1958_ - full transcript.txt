WITHIN 24 HOURS. HA. THIS CAN'T MEAN YOU INTEND TO ROB A MINE? THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT? IT -- IT WOULDN'T BE THE LISBON MINE? I WOULDN'T WANT MY WIFE ROBBED. WOULD I BE THAT FOOLISH TO COME TO YOU FOR CASH IF I'M GOING TO ROB YOUR WIFE'S PROPERTY? I KNOW, IT'S THE NEW HOPE. YOU ENGINEERED THERE, TOO. OH, I WORKED A DOZEN MINES IN THIS AREA, PROSPECTED OVER 100 HOLES. THAT ORE MUST BE IMMENSELY RICH FOR YOU TO GIVE AWAY $100,000 OF IT. BUT YOU'RE A BRILLIANT MINERALOGIST. WHY DON'T YOU EXTRACT THE GOLD YOURSELF? BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT THE TIME, AND I PROMISED TO BE ON THE STAGECOACH AT, UH, SUNDOWN TOMORROW. AND CARRYING HALF A TON ONTO A STAGECOACH MIGHT BE A LITTLE AWKWARD. BUT, UH, YOU COULD PUT IT THROUGH THE LISBON SMELTER. NOBODY WOULD BE THE WISER.

YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SHAKEN HANDS ON A DEAL SINCE THE MANAGER AT LISBON WELCHED ON ME. WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN'T WRITE CONTRACTS ON THIS KIND OF THING. WE'LL JUST HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER, WON'T WE? HA. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO USE FOR THE JOB? I HOPE TO USE VINCENTE. WHY? PERSONALLY, I DON'T TRUST MEXES. PERSONALLY, I DO. I'VE EVEN FORGOTTEN THE ALAMO. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A TRIP WITH ME? WHERE? NEW YORK FIRST, THEN ANYWHERE -- LONDON, PARIS. PARIS! BUT THAT WOULD TAKE MONTHS. WELL? WELL, YOU SAID YOU HAD TO BE HERE FOR THE DIVORCE OR YOUR WIFE WOULD TAKE ALL YOUR PROPERTY AWAY. OH, YEAH. WELL, THAT'S ALL BEEN ARRANGED. HOW? OH, MY WIFE'S GETTING DIVORCED BEFORE WE LEAVE. OH, MR. LOUNSBERY. YOU LOVE ME? WELL, I TRY TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. HOW MUCH WOULD YOU LOVE ME IF I WASN'T RICH? NOT AS MUCH. I DIDN'T THINK SO. HOW MUCH WOULD YOU LOVE ME IF I WEREN'T PRETTY? THAT'S A DIFFERENT CUP OF TEA. NO, IT ISN'T. A MAN BEING RICH IS EXACTLY LIKE A GIRL BEING PRETTY, SO THERE. THIS IS MY HOUSE. IT IS YOURS, IF YOU WISH IT. PLEASE COME IN.

YOU SEE, HE'S REALLY NOT A BAD MAN. HE'S A COW MAN, AND WITH $10,000 HE COULD BUY A BIG RANCH WITH PLENTY OF FEED, SHADE, TREES... OH, YOU'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE A FRIEND LIKE THIS. YEAH. WELL, MAYBE YOU WANT TO TALK ALONE, HUH? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHY SHOULD YOU PAY ME $10,000 WHEN YOU CAN HIRE HALF THE TOWN FOR $500? I OWE YOU SOMETHING. FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE? IT ISN'T WORTH IT. I PREFER MY OWN ESTIMATES. LET'S CALL IT POETIC JUSTICE. WHAT'S THAT? YOU'LL SEE TOMORROW AT 4:00 IF YOU'RE WITH ME. WHY? WHAT DO WE DO THEN? THE LISBON MINE... AND WE, UH, ROB IT. THE LISBON MINE? BUT THE LISBON'S ON MY PROPERTY. WAS ON YOUR PROPERTY. AND TO ME, IT ALWAYS WILL BE. WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED. YOU GOT A CRUST, HIRING ME TO ROB MYSELF. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BY POETIC JUSTICE.

LOOK, WE MEET HERE AT 2:30, AND WE GO UP THROUGH THESE ABANDONED BUILDINGS TO THE OLD NUMBER TWO SHAFT HERE. NOW, WE GO DOWN THE SHAFT TO THIS TUNNEL -- OH, I KNOW THIS TUNNEL. IT'S ALL BLOCKED UP AND BARRICADED. I BLOCKED IT UP TWO YEARS AGO. IF YOUR POCKET IS HERE, AND IT'S A RICH ONE, WHY YOU BLOCK IT UP? BECAUSE A HANDSHAKE MEANT NOTHING. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU'RE AFTER IS STILL THERE? OH. I HAD A LOOK-SEE. THERE'S AN OUTCROP OF NEARLY SOLID GOLD AS THICK AS YOUR ARM RIGHT HERE. WHEN YOU SHOOT, CAN YOU TAKE IT OUT WITH A DADO CUT AND FOUR HOLES? FOUR HOLES? I WOULDN'T WANT TO SHOOT TOO HEAVY, BOSS. WHY NOT PUT NINE? MM. WE WON'T HAVE TIME. THEY'RE WORKING TOO CLOSE. THEY'RE RIGHT HERE. HEY, YOU TELL ME? I WORK HERE EVERY DAY. THE BOSS MAN? HE'S A SLAVE DRIVER. YOU KNOW, I LIKE THIS. THIS IS A GOOD JOKE ON HIM. ALL RIGHT. I DO IT. I SHOOT FOUR, SIX. I SHOOT IT HEAVY. I SHOOT THE WORKS. WE'LL NEED A WAGON, DYNAMITE, TOOLS. WE BLAST THE SAME TIME THE DAILY MINE BLAST GOES OFF -- EXACTLY 4:00. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF WE MISS? WE CALL IT OFF? WE CAN'T MISS. AFTER WE BLOW THE POCKET, WE'VE GOT ONLY 10 MINUTES TO HIGH-GRADE THE ORE LOAD THE BAGS, AND START OUT. YEAH, BUT THEN WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE LOOT? HAVE YOU HEARD OF A MAN CALLED CYRIL LOUNSBERY? SURE. HIS WIFE OWNS THE MINE. THAT'S BASCOM'S SISTER. WHAT'S LOUNSBERY GOT TO DO WITH US? HE'LL TAKE THE GOLD FOR CASH. SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY AROUND HERE IS STEALING FROM EVERYBODY ELSE. MI VIDA, ARE YOU HERE? BUENOS DÃ­AS, QUERIDA. WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT NICE WORD? WHY, YOU SAID IT TO ME LAST NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP. IT'S THE LAST THING I REMEMBERED. AREN'T YOU UP EARLY? I BROUGHT YOUR WAGON. HERE IS THE MONEY LEFT OVER. YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PIGGY BANK. CALL IT ROOM AND BOARD. YOU CAME TO ME AS A FRIEND, AND I DID EVERYTHING YOU WANT ME TO DO, BUT YOU COME WITH MONEY, AND IT'S SPOILED. YOU PAY ME NOTHING. WHY NOT? WHY DID YOU HELP ME ON THE BRIDGE? BECAUSE YOUR HEART SPEAKS, YES? THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE. BECAUSE I LIKE YOU. SURE... BECAUSE I'M SO GOOD-LOOKIN'. OHH. YOU THINK I'M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I ONLY DREAM OF A MAN WHO IS PRETTY AS A POSTCARD? NO. I SEE INSIDE. AND WHAT I SEE INSIDE, QUERIDO, IS VERY GOOD. I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE FOR A LONG TIME. I'LL BE GONE AFTER TONIGHT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS MONEY AND GIVE IT TO ANY DOCTOR THAT'LL PROMISE TO CALL WHENEVER YOUR FRIENDS NEED HELP -- LIKE LAST NIGHT. YOU GET ALL THIS FOR THE JOB YOU ARE GOING TO DO? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO FOR ALL THIS MONEY? NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH? WELL, YOU CAN BE KILLED, HUH? COULD BE. WHY YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT WAS THAT YOUNG GIRL LAST NIGHT. MIGHT HAVE HAD HER BABY ALL BY HERSELF. OR MAYBE BECAUSE IT DON'T PAY TO BE BROKE WITHOUT FRIENDS. MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO HAVE TO BE BAD WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE GOOD. BUT THEN MAYBE IT'S ONLY THE POETIC JUSTICE OF IT ALL. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? DON'T ASK ME. EXCEPT MAYBE WHEN I'LL GET BACK, WE'LL MAKE UP FOR THE CHEATING THAT'S BEEN DONE ME AND THE 10 YEARS IN YUMA AND THE LONELINESS. THEN YOU WILL BUY THAT RANCH IN MEXICO? OH, I KNOW A FINE ONE DOWN THERE -- IN DURANGO. GOOD GRAZING LAND AND A HOME PLACE NEAR RUNNING WATER AND SHADE AND GREEN TREES ALL AROUND. YEAH, IF THINGS GO RIGHT, I'LL GO THERE. WOULD YOU, UH...

EVER SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU, ALL YOU'VE SAID TO ME IS "THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU." WHAT ARE YOU SO GRATEFUL ABOUT? THAT'S NOT VERY NICE. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU STOP THAT INNOCENT ACT? INNOCENT? I'M THE LEAST INNOCENT GIRL YOU EVER MET. IS THAT SO? I AS MUCH AS TOLD YOU WHAT I AM, BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. OH, HONEY, IT'S GETTING CLEAR. GOOD, BECAUSE I HATE FALSE PRETENSES.
