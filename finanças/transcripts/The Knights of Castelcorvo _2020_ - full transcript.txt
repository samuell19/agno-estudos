Hello, Andrea. I want to find my brother and bring him back home. This chamber holds all of their stolen memories. No. No! The children's memories! -It won't open. -Open up! He's getting closer! -Help me push! -Go! Everyone's forgotten about us completely. It's like we don't even exist at all. Unless, of course, you manage to defeat the Stria once and for all. Perhaps you can find the Stria's Midnight Key as well. It's the key to unlock her true heart. Zeno wants to join our side now. Welcome, Zeno, to the Knights of Castelcorvo. What can you tell us about the Lord of the Whispers? He's a master of lies and deception. This is where he lives. The dark. His powers can bring your worst nightmares to life. I'm coming for the keys. It's not my mother. I know who. It's the Lord of the Whispers. -No! -It's the Midnight Key. Welcome, children. How would you all like to join our little party? Come, sit down with me. We've never celebrated birthdays here before. -Time isn't real here. -That's true. But this year, I thought I'd try it. It's so nice having a party with all your friends. Well, come on. Have a seat with us. But you're not really friends with these children. They live in your jail. None of them remember who they are or their families. Well, let's ask them, shall we? Do you want to go back home, children? No! You see? They think this is a wonderful place. And you may not like it but that's your decision, dear. -Well, freedom's what we prefer. -Then we do have something in common. I like to be free myself. So how about this? I propose we have another game. This time, all of us will play together. You Knights have finally reached the end. If you're the winners, I'll set the children free. But if you lose, you'll have to give me all three of the keys, including the Midnight Key. And, of course, you'll stay here with me eternally. -How can we be sure that you won't cheat? -You have no other choice. Either accept what I'm proposing or be ready for me to declare open war on you. Would it be all right to discuss this privately? Hmm. Of course. We'll leave them for now, children. The party shall continue in a different room. -It's a trick. We have to refuse. -Even if it is, we have to accept. -At least then we might have a chance. -Exactly. You all heard what she just said. If we don't accept, it's war. I'm not sure if we can trust her. But I can tell you that it would be madness to face her head on. It would be over before it even started. Why are you saying that? Are you part of the trap for us? Zeno took the oath same as us. He's a knight, too. That means we trust him and you have to too, fine? Huh? -What did you say? -That we have to play the game. Zeno was right. We have no other choice. Well then... what's your decision? We've decided to play. What? Where am I? What's this? You did trick us! I knew I was right not to trust you again. That girl made you forget who you really are. You'll regret listening to her. You've made a big mistake, my son, turning against your mother. No, not again. Giulia, Betta, Riccardo! Is anyone out there? It looks like one of the riddles Riccardo likes to solve. Just surrender, it's pointless. You've already lost, girl. This game is impossible. It's not fair. Did you really think you could ever win against me? Come now, give me the keys. Here they are. Mine, once again. -What is this? These are... They're fake. Well, I guess defeating us isn't that simple either. You will pay for this. Betta, Giulia, can you hear me? -Anyone at all? Please, just don't hurt me. Now, give me the keys. -Give me them. Oh, Good. What's this? -You will regret this. -No, it wasn't even my idea. It's some kind of magic square. Let's see if I remember how to solve it. Two. Five... Little boy. You know what I want. The keys. This better not be another silly trick. The Morning Key at last. And the others? Why don't you figure it out? Wrack your brain like we did. Okay, two plus nine, eleven. Eight plus four, twelve. Three, fifteen. Anybody here? Can you hear me? Betta, Giulia, Matteo? You guys, did anyone get out? Can you hear me? Riccardo. Betta. Finally. -How did you get out? -On the padlock. -There's a magic square. -A what? A magic square puzzle, it's super easy. -See the diagonal line? -Yes. Two, plus five, plus eight, equals fifteen. Okay? You have to get 15 as a result and all the other lines as well. -Okay. What is it? -What? Can't you just... Fine. I'll give you the numbers myself. It'll be faster. Yeah, go for it. No, wait just a second. How do I know it's really you? -This could be another trick, you know? -It's me, Betta. Come on. -Okay, then prove it. Okay, are you writing it down now? Yes. Okay, two plus five plus eight is... it should equal 15. -Thanks for that. -No problem. -Let's go free the others now. -Is anyone out there? -No, please. No! Matteo! Matteo, don't worry. It's just us. Huh? Yes. -Good job, Matteo. -Yes. Thank you. I thought I'd never see you again. Come on, let's go. -Do you still have your keys? -No, she took them. Don't worry about it. Come on. Let's hurry. Five plus one equals six, which means the last number... Yes, it's nine. Yes. -- You figured it out. -- Yeah. Now, let's go and get the others. Giulia. Zeno. Giulia, you there? Listen, we're gonna get you out, Zeno. The Evening Key. -Only one more left. -The most important. -Zeno. -Do we still have time? -Yeah, but we should split up. Riccardo is right. You two go upstairs. We'll look for Andrea. Let's go. This is the last door, he has to be behind this one. -Andrea, are you in there? -Yes, Betta. -But the Stria took my key. -Please, don't worry. It's okay. I can tell you how to get out of there. He will come, he will. My mother will have figured out our plan by now. No. I'll admit, you were better than expected. But it's time to finish this. You're the only one left, little girl. Give me the key now. -Betta, don't. -Betta, don't do it. Just let me have it. No, no. -Arturo. He came. Here it is. We pulled it off. Let's go. We only have one chance at this. Give me the real key, girl. Before your friends turn to dust before your eyes. Leave her alone. Ah. The coward has suddenly found his courage. Perhaps that's the secret you told the tree in the woods. Wait a minute. I know everything, my dear. Yeah, except for where the Midnight Key is. I shall soon find out. Oh, you got that right. Thank you, Giulia. -Zeno. -Mama. -I do love you, Mama. -I love you. Now, I can see that power is much less important than love. Love is more important than eternity. Thank you. So then... the Midnight Key turned the Stria good? It seems that way. -But now where? Zeno, I'm sorry she's gone. The enchantment that bound my mother at this castle has at last been broken. But she's still here. I can feel her. What just happened? -I don't know. Where are we? Why are we here? The children got their memories back. Mama? -Where is my mom? -Guys, we did it! Come on, guys. Let's go help them out. We're gonna get you back home, okay? Don't worry. We'll get you out of this place. -Yeah. I'm Betta. Well, it's all right now. Don't worry. It's okay guys. Everything is all right now. -- Let's go. It's time to go. -- You okay? Let's go. Come on, you guys, go. Bye. -- Bye. -- Bye. -- Go on. -- Bye. Bye. But now they're all leaving. They're going back to their families. -I'll see you. -Bye. -See you. -Bye. -- Bye. -- Bye. -- Bye. -- Bye. -That was the last of them. -Well, it's our turn now. So... You're not gonna come back with us, are you? This is my home, Giulia. And I wanna find my mother whatever it takes. I'm so glad I met you, Giulia. Even though you'll forget all about me. No, that won't happen. I'm afraid that you will. That's what happens to people in the Nowhere. I know that's what it said in the prophecy. When the journey at last is done, the Knights will return to their homes all say for one. They'll stay behind and be remembered by none. You really are a Knight after all. And prophecies always come true. Take it. So, when you finally find your mom, if you want, you can come back to our world again. Come find me... so I can fall in love with you all over again. Bye, Giulia. Where is she? There she is. Giulia, finally. Why did you take so long to come out? I was just with... I don't know. Where was I? What's with the sad faces? Is anyone else happy we defeated the Stria? Making copies of the keys was a genius idea. Oh, thanks for defending me. -It's no problem. I guess we're even now. Well, almost. You've defended me a bunch of times already. So, what was the thing you said to the tree back in the woods? Um... uh, the thing is... Well... Where's the door gone to? And the game has gone back to normal. Even the app has uninstalled itself. -So, does that mean that... -It means we won! -Yes. -Whoo! I was wondering, when you finish a video game, what happens then? -You wait for the sequel. -Oh, that's cool. -Oh. -Yeah. The Knights of Castelcorvo versus the Headless Hunter. No, no. The Knights of Castelcorvo versus... the were-rabbit clan. Whoa! -What are were-rabbits? What are they? They're these terrifying rabbits. Isn't that right, Matteo? It's so scary. How about this idea instead. The Knights of Castelcorvo go on a relaxing vacation by the beach. Hey, listen to this one. The Knights of Castelcorvo go back in time... -To Count Dracula himself. -Wait, wait, I got one. How about the Knights of Castelcorvo tame a wild horse? The Knights of Castelcorvo versus Frankenstein's monster.
