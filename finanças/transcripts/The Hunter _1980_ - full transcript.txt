Put Mr. Thorson back on. Yeah? You did a damn good job. You done your duty, and I was protectin' my kin. Next time you're down Houston way, stop in and say hello, why don't ya? Yeah, sure, I will.

It's important to me, Ralph. But mushrooms-- Natural childbirth. Listen... I'm thinking I'll have to move in with my sister for a while. Now, wait. If you go over to your sister's-- She's done Lamaze with all three of her kids. She's a pro, O.K.? I need you here. Do you have to leave town right away? Got to pick up Winston Blue later today. Winston? That's three times this month. Crazy Winston. You have to clear the street for your own safety. Get up on the sidewalk. You have to clear the street. You'll have to move that car. - Who's in charge here? - Sergeant Werblow. I live in that building. Hey, come back here! W-20-Adam. Perimeter has been secured. It's confirmed that the suspect is inside the building. W-20-Adam, Roger. Yeah. W-20-Adam, uh-- Are you Werber? Sergeant Werblow. Who the hell are you? Thorson. And that's my pickup. You think you got the SLA in there? We got an armed fugitive up there. - Oh, bullshit. - W-20-Adam, uh, we're not requesting additional units-- Winston, it's Papa. Hey. What the-- Hey! Listen. I don't know who the hell you think you are, but you better get your ass out off here. This is police business. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Don't make such a fuss, for heaven's sake. He's dressing. Dressing.

I want to see the flashbulbs poppin'. There you go. All right. Hands high! I know the procedure, baby. Walk toward me! Yeah. Far enough. Hey, brother! Hands behind your head. Beautiful. I know that. Until your boyfriend shows in court. But I need my car for work! I need it for collateral. I'll give you my pink slip. I don't want your underwear. I want your car. No car, no bond. Now, what's so difficult? My son Anthony-- He's a good boy. Maybe he's a little mixed up-- He's going to come back. But he means well. Listen, this is the first time-- No. The first time, he took a hostage in a liquor store. Mr. Bernardo, Mrs. Bernardo, can I-- Can I talk honestly to you? Yeah. Sure, of course. Your son is a rat. He's holed up somewhere, and he ain't ever coming back... because if he does, he knows he's going to jail, and he's been there enough times to know he doesn't like it. Now, you and me-- the three of us-- we have a problem, which is that if your Anthony doesn't show in... 1 8 more days... then I'm out 1 00,000, and your restaurant belongs to me. And I don't want another restaurant. I already got two of them. You mean... we lose the restaurant? If the son were only as smart as the mother. I worked 26 years of my life to build up that restaurant. I mean, the buildings, the parking lot. I-- I can't lose that place now. Mr. Blumenthal, what can we do? We've got to get somebody to go out and find Anthony and bring him back. You mean like a... detective. No, no, no. The man I have in mind is more of a specialist in this line. Mr. Thorson is a bounty hunter. My God! No, I'm sorry. It's-It's either that, or your restaurant; so you two put your heads together and decide. Do you see what you started? I told you to keep your mouth shut and let me talk to him. You owe me 800 for Price and 1 ,000 for Billie joe Faith. Papa, please, enough already. Coffee. You did a good job. You're the best in the world. That's $ 1 .7 5. 1 ,800. Thank you. Papa, can I talk to you? I'm talking to him, so get out of here. Whaddya got? An assault on a policeman. He's heading to Mexico. I'm gonna take a substantial loss on this thing. Great! Now, take a walk, you ganef. We ain't interested. Ahhh... I'm interested. So... when is the baby due? Soon. You should marry the schoolteacher. Eight years is enough already. She's been married. She didn't like it. Eight years? She don't trust you yet? Mind your own business and pay your debts, hmm? Please. Not while I'm eating. What's this? A baby present from me to you. Tony Bernardo. It's a piece of cake. ''Assault. Attempted Murder. Armed Robbery.'' A very bad boy. No, he's a good boy. A little mixed up, maybe. And he's a shooter, too. He really wants to come in. He'll be happy to see you. You'll talk, you'll make friends-- If he's so easy, you bring him in. I would, but at my age, I'm not supposed to eat airline food. I'm into this for 1 00 grand. I'll make it worth your while. Not Bernardo. He's too dangerous. I'll take the Branch brothers. My cocker spaniel can bring me the Branch brothers. Lunching with the last of the big spenders? Hello, Pete. Captain Spota, always a pleasure. See you later at the house. See you at the house. You heard any talk about him? What kind of talk? Nothing. Papa! Telephone! Yeah. Thorson? My name's Mason. Remember me? No. Well, you will. I'm gonna kill you. I've been watchin' you, Thorson. I'm gonna kill you. I don't know what you're using, Mason, but it's no good for you. All right, all right, I'll take the Branch brothers. Three grand. Forget it. Three Branch brothers, $3,000. There are only two Branch brothers. Bob blew himself up. It's still 3,000, and that's that. They're children. They-- They're little boys. They don't even shave yet. Hey, they're the Wild Bunch. Everybody takes advantage, so-- So why shouldn't you? All right. All right. 3,000. I'm Cuban. I don't know what you're talking about. The judge let me off when I mentioned your name. What's with my TV set? Your picture's no good, man. The picture was perfect. No, the color was off. I'm fixing it. Hayes-- What do you know about a guy named Mason? Mason. Mason. Let's see. There's Tiny Mason, a pimp. No. Uh... There's Billy Mason, a dealer. He's dead. Rocco Mason-- That's the one. Oh, yeah. Speed freak. When they sent him to San Quentin, they had to submerge him in Thorazine. He's been out a month. Why? The name just popped into my head. Thanks. Can we watch the set in the bedroom? No. Aw-- Hi, honey. I, uh... got to catch the red-eye to Nebraska. Oh, no. It's a buck. It's a job. You said you'd take me to Lamaze class. I will. Then you take me to the airport, O.K.? All right. Hey, look. I got kind of a weird phone call. May be something, may be nothing. I don't know. But, uh, you remember how to shoot this, right? Yeah. O.K. It's got a full clip. Bang, bang, bang, bang. I'll be O.K. Hi, Ralph. How you doing? Hi, Dotty. How long you been here? Few minutes. Mmm. God, that perfume, I love it. When are you going to make an honest woman out of this girl? Why ruin a good relationship? When are you due, honey? Pretty soon. It'll be different in this house with a kid. Different? Why? We're already running an orphanage. What's one more? You'll see. Dotty. Telephone. What are you, a troublemaker? You scared or something? Yeah. What happens if I get popped? What happens to Dorothy and the kid? End up with a houseful of toys, a mean dog, and a '51 Chevy. I'm getting too old. That's a lousy excuse. She's a terrific girl, and she loves you. It's going to be wonderful. You're going to be a father, Ralph. You think you got troubles. Huh? Ralph, we're in a hurry. Yeah. I'll talk to you, Pete. Bye-bye, Pete. Bye-bye, dear. You'll love Lamaze, Ralph, if you'll just give it half a chance. Many guys in the class were just as hesitant-- The fast lane is clear. You could pass this slowpoke. Every guy in that class has come around 1 00% since they've been in there. - There's a faster car behind us. - Shut up and let me drive. You going to sit there, or you coming in? Don't be so squirrelly. Squeeze her leg firmly, coaches, building in intensity like a real contraction. Building to a peak now. 40 seconds. O.K., only 1 5 seconds to go. Easing off a little now. Check for relaxation. Five seconds to go. And... contraction ends. And relax. I'm so pleased you're here to help Dotty. It's always more difficult when a woman has to do this alone. I got a bad back. It's always difficult the first time. If you squeeze her, it'll really help her a lot. If she can practice relaxing through pain, it'll make her more secure about handling labor.

Tell Papa Mason said soon-- Real soon. Aaaahhhhh! Aah! Branch brothers? Sure. Crazy bastards. Dumb as shit, and mean. Went to school with john, the bigger one. We was on a basketball team. I just need directions-- All in the Lord's time, son. I... made a mistake. john Branch put dynamite in the locker room urinals, blew the whole damn gym halfway across to Canada. Look, I'm going to take these two guys back to L.A. I need directions and a couple of your guys to help me bring them in. O.K.? I'll give you directions, but I ain't giving you any of my men, not with those crazy bastards. And you're a crazy bastard for goin' after 'em. O.K., that should do it. We'll check around the neighborhood. If anything turns up, we'll let you know. Thank you. I'm sure it was just some nut. Thank you. Dotty, I think I should have a substitute handle your class for the day. Oh, no, I'm O.K. I don't want to make a big deal out of this. God knows what Ralph would do if he found out. We just can't handle any more trouble. Not now. Have it your way, but try to relax, all right? ] Classical Music Playing ] Oh, shit! - Yee hee hee hee! - Ha ha ha! Yee-haw! I can't see shit!

I'll get the water. Ralph. Oh. I'm sorry. You go to another Lamaze class today? Yep. How'd she go? You don't want to know. Yeah, I do. No, you don't. I really do. We talked about transition, and we talked about the coach and how important he is. Coach? Yeah. In Lamaze, we say that birth is like a game. The mother's the team. The father's the coach. How the game turns out depends a lot on the coach. There's this woman in our class named Edith. She said with her first baby she started pushing too soon. See, you're not supposed to push until you're completely dilated and the baby's head's just right down there. But you feel like you have to, so you blow instead. Like that. Well, Edith wasn't dilated, but she started pushing anyway. So her husband took her face in his hands, and he said, ''Blow, Edith.'' And he started blowing himself right to her, willing her to do it with him. Yeah, like that. And she was able to stop pushing because he did that. Don't you think that's beautiful? Such a sucker for inspirational moments. You ought to let your hair grow out. It looked a lot better when it was longer. I'm too old for that. You like old things. That's all you care about. You don't like anything that's new. New things are no good. Give 'em a chance to prove themselves. You know they will in time. I love you. Shit. Hey. Hello, Pete. Come on in, Ralph. just the guy I want to see. What you need is a drink. There we go. Hey, why don't you let me-- Come on. Come on. Come on. Bang! Bang! Bang! You're dead. You see that house? That's Hyatt, Frank B. Male caucasian. 5'9'', 1 80 pounds. Come on, Pete. Hand over the gun. Mmm. Good, Ralph. Very good. Talk to the subject. Calm him down. You know that bastard sells dope to schoolchildren and lives in that house. He looks up here, and he sees me, and he laughs his head off. He throws pebbles up at me. I swear, he throws pebbles up at me. Find 'em on the deck when I come home. Is that right? Come on. I'm asking you. Is that right? That's the way it is, pal. That's what I am-- A pebble. Well, guess what the pebble did. I took a little for myself. just a couple of bags from the inventory room. I got tired of being a pebble, and I sold some, and somebody got busted, and somebody talked, and guess who they're coming after. Come on, Ralph. Be a pal. Guess who they're coming after. Would you go? No. So I figured I'd do the right thing. I'm going to blow Hyatt, Frank B.'s, head off... and then I'm going to do me in. Come on, Pete. That's the booze talking. You're drunk. Sure. Sure, I'm drunk. Think I could kill myself if I were sober? Come on, Ralph. There's another bottle over on the couch somewhere. Let's finish it off. Then you go away. Please, Ralph. You know I'm right. I can't go in the slammer. You know what they do to cops. I put half of them in there, for Christ's sake. Let's get shit-faced, then... you leave me alone.

Don't you think I know that? I think you know it. I don't think you accept it. I think you got to be crazy to bring a kid into this garbage-can world. You should've had it aborted. I begged you, then I pleaded with you. It wasn't your decision. It was mine. Both of us should've been involved in the decision. Both of us don't get an abortion, Ralph. Both of us don't have to climb up on that table. Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Have your kid. Our kid! Yeah. Tom. Hey, Papa. just told me it came over the radio upstairs. Spota just killed himself.

It doesn't make what you said O.K. I was out of line. I'm tired of your crap, Ralph. You don't want me. You don't want the baby. Well, we don't want you. Papa? Psst! Wake up. Who is it? It's me, Ritchie. Get out of bed. Open the front door. Ritchie, go away. Get out of bed and open the door. Shit. What time is it? It's 2:20. What day is it? It's a beautiful day. Up and at 'em, Papa. Come on. I'm tired. Shit. Oh... I don't know why I break my back trying to help you. You got a kid coming, all kinds of bills-- She's gone. What? What happened? What'd you do to her? Nothing. She was nuts about you. She's the best thing ever happened to you. She's a pain in the ass. I'm coming in. Oy! That's a nice way to talk. Papa. Look, Papa... a Chinese philosopher said, ''With money, the world goes round. Without it, it goes flat.'' He also said-- Who said that? He was a cook. Look, it takes a lot of money to get a woman back, believe me, and I'm here to offer you a lot of money. For Anthony Bernardo. You met his parents. $8,000. I don't want her back.

Maybe you have a job, maybe you don't. Who does it matter to? Tell me. Nobody. Like litter in the streets. Yeah! Dotty made this place make sense. She made you make sense. You don't need that? I'll get Bernardo. He-- He's living in Chicago-- ''A toddling town.'' O.K. How would you define a great man? Was Napoleon as great a man as Lincoln, for instance? Anybody? Kelly. Lincoln was much greater than Napoleon. Why would you say that? Well, Lincoln freed the slaves. He kept the Union together. But didn't Napoleon do some good things for Europe? Yeah, but he made himself dictator. All right. Don't go crazy. I'll be right back. Yes? I got to go to Chicago. So? I did the shopping. You interrupted my class. I'll be back in a few days. Well, I may not be there. All right, all right. Will you give me a break? O.K. Let's get back to Lincoln, now. Kelly? When I tell you to come home, I want you home! Look at that shit.
