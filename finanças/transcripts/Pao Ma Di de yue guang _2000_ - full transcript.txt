According to legend men and women were in couples, but somehow Cupid separated them and put them in different parts of the world. Some of them make every efforts to find their separated mate. What are they gonna do, even if they find their mate? Why is it like this? Why so many people believe me when I'm lying, but no one will listen when I speak the truth? Why do I make a totally reverse decision overnight about something I always thought was correct? Have I been doing something wrong? Why is heaven torturing me like this? I admit I have quite an imagination towards sex, but heaven shouldn't fool me this way. PERFECT MATCH This lamp looks familiar. Where have I seen it before? Well, it's in the movie In the Mood for Love. Right. It's less than $10,000, it's not expensive at all. - Let's put it at the doorway. - Good. Miss, I want to buy this. Sure, look around some more. This chair is nice too. How nice? - It's only 19,000. - 19,000? It can't be that cheap! I like it. How much do you like it? As much as I like you. Miss, I want this chair too. Thank you! Someone scratched our car. There's a note. I'm sorry. Come to Sun Tea House if you want compensation. I'll be sitting at the second table on the left. What are you looking at? Did you leave this note? Boss, they have come for you. Hey, don't go! Hey! Edmond! How do you know me? Everyone in Kailiu knows you. You're the only one who got in HKU. It's me! I used to live in Block 6. I'm Man! I remember now. That's right! I was so sorry just then. My men scratched your car. I'll pay for the repaint fee. It's trivial, no need. Don't turn me down. As it'll make me embarrassed! When I'm in this hood, I always teach my guys... Taking up responsibility! What mustn't we do? Trying to avoid responsibility! What about now? It's okay, we've known since childhood... 30,000, enough or not? Well, maybe... Let's chip in if it's not enough! No! Wait. Well... We're all brothers, just one thing... If ever we meet again, you just pay for tea. - Deal? - Deal! - It's a deal? - Deal! - Goodbye. - Hey! You don't have my phone number! Wait, my number is easy to remember. 9-4-2-6-9-4-8-9. - Isn't it great? - Sure. - Wonderful numbers? - Wonderful. Causeway Bay is my neighborhood. Give me a call if you want to book a table or something. From Wan Chai to Central District, you just have to mention my name if you need help. Okay? - Okay! - Deal? Deal! - Say goodbye to Mr. Edmond. - Goodbye, Mr. Edmond. - Deal? - It's a deal! I'll be waiting for your call. Man. Edmond! I'll be waiting for you! Mind your steps! An educated man is very different. He's so different from us. Morning, Mr. Edmond. Nice to see you again! Mr. Edmond! Susan! Your friends are all waiting for you there. Yeah? - Mr. Edmond. - Hello! - Have some brandy? - Thanks. Same as usual. - What are you chatting about? - Something bad about you. What about? It can only be talked about behind your back. These guys are being strange tonight. Not only strange, but sly too. Mr. Edmond, you're going to sell the car? - I'm going to sell my car? - Are you? I bought it only a year ago. Don't you know what kind of person I am? I'm loyal to my belongings. Inform me if you want to sell the car. You know my taste... More or less the same as yours. You like my car or do you like my... Let me introduce my friend from LA. She's helping me out for the time being. Irene. Irene? Sounds like a perfect match with Edmond. The watch she's wearing matches yours. Really? Look! - Such a coincidence. - Such a coincidence. Luckily I know you both, or else I would think you are... What? Enjoy yourselves. Drink it. BOK LOK TONG - Nice! - Last night was... - The game is fun. - Wicked. - Good morning! - Morning, Mr. Edmond. This is our... - Ape World? - Yes. - It has taken me ages to find it. - You managed to find it! - Lend it to me. - Mr. Edmond. Morning. Morning, Mr. Edmond. Any job for me today? No. Normal. - Get me some coffee. - Okay. Ape World. Edmond? Okay, I'll finish this soon. How can you fool around at this time? What do you mean? Haven't you heard the news? What news? I thought you knew already. - You don't have a good network. - You talking about yourself? What is it? 10 more minutes. I just got here. 10 more minutes will be lunch time? My bookshop Bok Lok Tong is declaring bankruptcy. Since I'm your boss and friend, I am now giving you 10 minutes notice. The website has to be closed. The salary for you and I is astronomical, and the staff outside are burning money every day. We haven't paid the rent in three months. Mr. Edmond! Mr. Edmond. - Hey. - Hey, you. We're still talking behind your back. - About me again? - Yeah. What about? I dare not tell you. You may get mad. Mr. Edmond, are you going to sell the car? I am serious. No way, I'll never sell the car. Fine, okay. You have arrived? Scoot over. When did you arrive? A bit earlier than you did. Susan, we're having late supper with Raymond. Let's go. Susan, are you listening? Sorry, Susan will stay here tonight. I've left the key on the desk. I'll get my things later on. What do you mean? Susan, go home first. I need to go to the washroom first. Mr. Edmond, I've told you already. My taste is more or less the same as yours. Cheers. Cheers. What's up? They are my friends. So? Don't you think you should keep a low profile? I've tried to be low profile, but you're never mature. Susan. It's my company going bankrupt, not me. I'm like a blue chip company. We talk about the long run, understand? You won't let me back out? Susan. You can still change your mind. If a chance comes, I can soar instantly. Do consider it. Edmond, I've been with you so long, you have never saved a penny. Everything at home was bought in instalments. Your car, the rent for the apartment, they add up to 100,000 a month! You're now jobless, you're finished! Do you want me to suffer with you? Come on, be mature. I'll consider you again if you bounce back. But you are getting suspended now. I can't be of help, sorry. You bitch. You never complained when you lived off of me. Beware of that turd Samuel! He has AIDS. He has VD too! How could you eavesdrop on us? Stop following me, okay? I'm a strong man. I don't need sympathy from others. If you really have something to say, I don't mind giving you a few seconds. Go ahead. I live upstairs. - Hello. - Who are you? Sir, do you live here? What if I do? A flat facing the street? What if it does? I'm a reporter from Running Wild Magazine. You know, the situation in Hong Kong, we believe mass media should let readers know the truth. Because of this, I hope we can borrow your window to take snapshots of the first floor flat on the opposite side of the street. Paparazzi? I don't mind that name, as everyone calls us that anyway. But if we succeed in this reporting, we'll give you a big reward. Let me tell you, I hate paparazzi. If you don't go away, I will beat you up, I know kung fu. Must I prove it to you? Sir, take it easy. I have evidence in hands. But to tell you the truth, I really want you to do us a favor. We'll surely give you a reward afterwards. Do consider it, here is my phone number. Relax. That's Thai boxing. TURN DEFEAT INTO VICTORY I mustn't be treated like a bad choice. People who dump me are foolish. What's important is that I have self-confidence. This morning, I must start my turn-around plan. Happy Valley is a place for the successful. People living in this district are either rich guys or professionals, even movie stars. Man. I'll rent it to you cheap, as you're my ex-neighbor. 12,000. 12,000? It is reasonable. Look at that guy. I rented him a window space for 18,000. Who is he? Your ex-neighbor too? He's a paparazzi of Running Wild Magazine. Damn, I hate paparazzi, they invade people's privacy. They're real jerks! Bulky, what did you say? What? What? I said, "Why must you act like dogs?" Forget it. I can explain this. My duty is to reveal the real side of showbiz. Bullshit. You know, readers have the right to know. Being in showbiz, they must be prepared for this. You must've read such magazines. I know nothing about rights. That's it. You'll be neighbors soon, so please stop fighting. Sorry, I won't share a flat with a dog. - He has the right to choose. - That's it. No way. Come on, you can do it. You think 12,000 is too much? Okay, how about 10,000? Hey, I only rent the window, and you charge me 18,000. You charge him 10,000 for that? Really? - Well... - No need to say more. I usually rent a suite for 3,000, bye. - That's your budget. - Bye! What about 8,000? Just shut up. No one will think that you're a mute. Who's the landlord, you or me? You must make it clear. The normal rent for this flat is 30,000. I've already given you 18,000, so I'm sort of your boss. You're really daydreaming. Excuse me, sir. It won't take you long. Please pick up my phone for me, it's under the car. Drive off and you can pick it up. Though I have the car key, it doesn't mean it's my car. Please, I'm expecting an urgent call. Please help me get it back. Please. It's here, just underneath. Got it? Too far inside. You needn't answer it for me. Okay, thanks. Hello, speaking. I started to envy mechanics, as I found that viewing women from below is a totally different experience. I believe she is a D-cup. Edmond. Edmond! Hey, I'll rent it. How much did you say? 12,000? Here's two months' deposit. I'll move in right away! But there's a dog here. I was only joking. I love pets. 6,000 more, if you love pets. Mr. Edmond, so early today? Boss, let me introduce them. - This is the boss, Pinky. - Hello. My roommates, Man, and Patrick. - There's a table over there. - We'll be fine. Okay, help yourselves. I have a job to do. Hey! Mr. Wong, how are you? Have you found a job? No, I want to take a break for six months. - Call me if you need help, bye. - Thanks. Isn't he Raymond Wong of the Happy Ghost? Yeah, that's right. You know Raymond Wong? This is Green Spot. People from showbiz flock here. Let me show you around. No, don't get in my way. Mr. Edmond. - I'm leaving. Have fun. - Really? Let's have a drink next time. Mr. Edmond, such a coincidence. Yeah, such a coincidence. A dozen beer for me. Is it worth it? What? Is it worth it for a woman like that? Do you want business? - Let's cheers. - Cheers. You tell me... Am I a blue chip? Wake up! Hey! Wake up! Hey! Wake up! Trouble-maker! So heavy. You're very heavy! Move yourself, man. Hello? Anyone here? Hey, where's your key? Wake up. What the heck! You haven't got the key with you. Sorry. I drank too much last night. Please don't be mad at me. Who are you? I'm Linda. I'm Irene's primary school classmate and her roommate now. Linda? Linda! - You work at... - I work at a TV station. TV station? What did you two do here last night? I saw you sleeping together when I came back. What did you do? I don't know what we did. Where is she now? I'm her roommate, not her mom. How would I know where she is? You men are all maniacs. Do it in the bedroom, why the sofa? It's not me who decided. Sue. - Sorry. - What? Sold out. How come? You didn't even keep one for me? No, a man just came and bought all the tiramisu. He's a friend of the boss, I couldn't refuse. The jerk bought my cake? Wish you'd break your nose! You deserve it. It's you? Are you okay? I'm fine, but it's a bit strange. I've fallen four times today. My tiramisu's smashed. I got it. Why do I fall down every time I see you? Not your fault. It's a bit my fault. What? Nothing. How's your hand? Still hurts? Nothing now. Just a little cut. So, you like tiramisu a lot? I don't like it, but I love it. I love tiramisu too! Do you? Unfortunately, the tiramisu's gone. Or we could have eaten it together. I'll go in and get something. Come on. It's so simple. Just mix some eggs, coffee, rum, and sugar, and the tiramisu is done. It's not that easy. I took up a course in LA, and failed it. Your instructor wasn't good then. You know how to make it? You don't know. I got an A in home economics. What's wrong with you? You took up home economics? So? Home economics is an easy A. So, why did you go to the States? For studying? Our whole family emigrated there when I was eight. My parents pamper me a lot. They arrange everything for me. Be it of the subjects I took, the car I drove, or the job I took up. Maybe they'll also choose a husband for me. You're lucky. It seems I am lucky, but in fact, they don't know at all what I want. So, have you found a job? Not yet. The rent in Happy Valley is so high. Why don't you move? You don't understand. I don't want to move out after having lived here. Because Happy Valley is a unique place. It represents a certain social status. Don't think I am mad for money. I grew up in Kailiu. I remember when I was in junior high. Mom took me to Cheung Hing Restaurant for the first time. I had a sweet bun. It was delicious. Since then, I was determined to study hard and make money, so I could move into Happy Valley. I really don't want to move out. What about you? You have any dreams? You tell me first. My dream is nothing special. What is it? It's something trivial. I want to run my own shop. No need to be big, just 30 meters wide will do. Kitchen will be at the rear. A glass cabinet in front. What am I going to sell? Home-made tiramisu. I also have a very special rule. I'll only sell tiramisu to frequent clients. Why is that? They are the ones who have tried my products. If they come back, it means they love the cake I make. I want all clients to praise the tiramisu I make. Yet this is only my dream. Such a cake shop will close very soon. What's wrong? Nothing. And you? Do you have dreams? Secret. You're back? So late? Over time again? What's wrong? The director got mad again? Bad shots? Say no more, it's my fault. Forget it. Remember the drunk I brought home last time? Sure, the one who lives downstairs. I ran into him today. It's nothing strange, we live in the same building. I think that I'm exactly the same as him. What do you mean? He doesn't have what you have. Not that. Our dream is exactly the same. Many people go buy the stocks of HK Bank and MTR. They all want the same thing, to make money. But do they all end up making money? You're not romantic at all. It's about being realistic. Don't you have dreams? Sure I do. I want to become famous. I want everyone in town... No, I want the whole world to know me. I want to be a super star. What if you become one, so? You're not practical at all. I only want to run a cake shop that sells tiramisu exclusively. And a man who loves me too. Man. Stop playing games. Leave me alone, it's the climax. You pervert, you film people secretly? You know nothing. Come, try some. What is it? Just open your mouth. - What is it? - It's not that bad, is it? Taste it yourself. People who tasted the tiramisu prepared by Edmond last night... were rushing to the toilet. You're lousy. Are you exaggerating? It was just running to the toilet once or twice. You kept going to the toilet, not just once or twice. I couldn't sleep at all. No wonder I heard someone downstairs walking about last night. So it was you. Hey, again? Do you have manners? It's not about manners. It's a natural thing. Go and see a doctor! How come he suddenly takes to making tiramisu? I can't think of any other reason except for women. What are you guys talking about? About Edmond learning to make tiramisu. Irene seems to love tiramisu. Right. She kept saying she'd learn to make tiramisu when she was in LA. Right, when she attended primary school, she told me she had a dream. She wants to open a shop that sells tiramisu only. Good idea. There's a good selling point there. She will fail for sure. Doing valet service is better. It's a business that requires no capital. No, we should all have better ambitions. Isn't valet service a kind of ambition? What? He left in the middle of a conversation, so rude. He's always like this. He's always looking for girls. Sorry, I have a date. - Do you? - Yes. I have a date too. Anyone down there? I don't think you're looking for me? Looking for me? No. Mr. Edmond. Not yet in bed? How's your tiramisu recipe going? I'm more or less successful, but I need some technical backup. Are you free tomorrow? What is it? Technical backup. Sure. You'd better tidy up the kitchen then. I can demonstrate it for you tomorrow. It'll be bad if you mess up my kitchen. I promise to clean it up for you. You promise. Let's pinky promise. I've brought ingredients. You've bought some too? What have you bought? What have you bought? Eggs, sugar, lady fingers, kuala, Expresso, cocoa powder. You can't have this one, though. I've bought a bottle of red wine. And a container too. We must use this technique. No, you'll make bubbles this way. Will it look better this way? Don't put it all in. Time's up! It's ready. No, we must check if it's all set. What? It's spoilt. No way. I mustn't let our first product fail. What are you doing? Cut it out. How can you? So dirty. It's not dirty. You cut it too thick, there's nothing left. Very hard. It's done. Don't move. I'm back. Am I interfering? No. I'll go and wash my hands. It's dirty. I'm not really interfering? Who forgets the key? - Hello. - Who are you looking for? Sorry, excuse me, do you know this girl Irene who lives upstairs? I rang the bell, but no one answered. - I'm afraid it's the wrong flat. - Who are you? I'm Samson, her fiancé. Want a drink? No, thanks. Have some tea. Okay, thanks. I've got some tea here. - Put some in. - What is it? Laxative. You nutcase! The guy out there stole your girl. And you serve him with expensive tea, are you nuts? Of course I must teach him a lesson. Stop, we're not little kids. She's like your wife to me. I mustn't let another guy seduce her. Are you a man? What do you want me to do? That guy is ruining your chance, and you are serving him tea? You should show your hostility. Can't you be more manly-ish? I'd better chop him up then. Will that make you happy? - Have some tea. - Thanks. You're Irene's friends, good then. She's absent-minded, she needs someone to look after her. Luckily she has good neighbors. My pleasure, it's our duty. Is it all right if I wait for her here? What do you think? If you wait by her door, you'll see her right away when she comes home. That's true. Sorry to bother you. - I'll see you out. - Thanks. Mind your step. Sorry, my friends are weird. No, they're just frank. Shall we have a drink somewhere? No, I'd better wait by her door. Irene. I missed you. Your friend is very nice. He invited me in to his place. - Did he? - Yes. Let's go to your place first. Okay. Sorry, one of my friends had no guts today. I am in no mood for cooking, let's just have this. What can I say, man? I don't understand. How can you let another man take your woman? We're eating cup noodles here. They're probably having candlelight dinner right now. You hear any noise? This odd sound makes me think that they are making love. - The second time already. - Enough! Do you have a heart? He's fiery. Dare you to go up there then? I'll surely back you up! Right! We'll both back you up, come on. Let's go. Spare me please. - Poor thing. - No guts. Big guy, you have too much imagination. You need more strength. You came back to Hong Kong because of him? It's nothing to do with him. You left without a word, we were all worried about you. Including your parents. What did you say to them? I lied for you. I said you always had a dream to travel to Europe before we get married. But I was too busy to go with you, so you went there alone. Sorry. Actually, no matter what happens to us, we shouldn't make our family worried. I bought this air ticket for you, keep it. I hope that you will go with me the day I leave Hong Kong. I don't care why you wanted to return to Hong Kong before we get married. I think you won't tell me, I'm not going to ask you either. But I will respect your decision. I'll face your parents myself. You needn't worry. I won't let them worry. This spaghetti is as tasty as before. I really hope that you can cook for me in the future. I mean it. I'll go get some drinks. - What a coincidence. - Just got off work? I'm working now. Do you think that life is like shopping in a convenience store? We see so many options but don't know which one to pick. For most people, they know what they want when they enter the store. Yet they still want to look at all the choices. Just like me. I always buy lemon tea every time, but I always stand in front of the fridge and look at everything before I pick up lemon tea. Take your time. What a coincidence. Very heavy. Irene? Where are you? I'm going back to Happy Valley. Are you okay? I want to see you. I have something to tell you. Me too. Let's meet outside the church. I'll wait for you. You're really going back to the States? You'll leave Edmond? I know he's serious with you. He's not fooling around. - I have made a decision already. - A decision? Mr. Edmond? Great. That's the right decision. If someone would fulfill my dream for me, I'd be very touched. What? What dream do you mean? Running a cake shop that sells tiramisu. That day at the bar, I revealed your dream unintentionally, and now everyone knows it. You mean he knows that I want to have a tiramisu shop? Maybe. There were so many people in the bar that night. Mr. Edmond was there too. He should have heard it. What is it? You're too happy? What's with that face? Say, should I envy you or should I be jealous of you? Is she home? She's left you a letter. Edmond. According to legend men and women were in couples, but somehow Cupid separated them and put them in different parts of the world. Some of them make every efforts to find their separated mate. When I first met you, and found that you were like me, that you and I had the same dream, I was really happy. I thought I had found my other half. But when I learned later that what you're doing is duplicitous, I became really disappointed. Maybe if I didn't believe in fairy tales I wouldn't have been so miserable now. I've decided to go back to the States. I think I can forget what happened very soon. And I'll try to make a happy life for myself. Bye. Irene. I have a job to do. Mr. Wong, how are you? - Have you found a job yet? - No, I want to take a break. - Call me if you need help. - Thanks. Isn't he Raymond Wong of Happy Ghost? Yeah, the Happy Ghost, Raymond Wong. You know Raymond Wong? This is Green Spot. People from showbiz flock here. Let me show you around. No, don't get in my way. Last time I told you, this time... So troublesome. - Hello, beautiful! - What is it? Has anyone told you that you look like Amanda Lee? Sometimes. Shall we play a drinking game? No. Let's play "One and Two"? "Little Bee"? I'd better not. Don't act like you don't. - I'll give you a handicap. - Yeah? Half a dozen beers! That one! Amanda, filming will begin next week. - Really? - Yes. - What image shall I use? - Raymond Wong? Give her some advice. Thanks. Remember, I want to look pretty. Amanda Lee? Hi. Do you want my autograph? This is Happy Valley. - Your usual trick will fail here. - I pay more than 10,000 for rent. Only because there are lots of pretty girls around here. Don't stop me. I won't stop you from killing yourself. Go ahead. - Green Spot, please. - Right away. The one I saw last time... D-cup! Are you coming out tonight? Forget it, that's it. What a coincidence to see you here! Yeah, that's right. That guy called you again? Don't mention him please. Okay. I have never seen you here before. I've only recently moved to Happy Valley. I'm Man. Rachel. Where were we? I remember now. You're a teacher? Nurse? Flight attendant? Flight attendant. Why? Sounds like you are mentioning the roles that Japanese AV girls play. You like that kind of thing too? No need to guess anymore. Public relations? You're a PR, I know. A publicist. Are you strong? I'm very strong. I can work all night. You want to try? - Really? - Definitely. Is this a good spot? But this is a public place. How about pulling the top down and then do it here? We'll have a good time. I know some people have special appetites. Some prefer the office, a kitchen, under the stairs, or by a swimming pool. But I haven't tried those places. It's really my first time tonight. Playing with this? Isn't it too extreme? I really haven't tried this before. What are you talking about? I have an exhibition tomorrow, I want you to help me nail some boards. Nail some boards? You say you're strong, and that you can work all night. Thanks for helping me tonight. All night, okay? Nail some boards? Rachel, any water? Rachel? I've been waiting for you all night? You know? You're never concerned about me. I won't trust you again. I know. I know I'm not your wife. She's feeling sick. You should stay with her at home. But, you know, when I'm sick, I wouldn't dare to give you a call. Forget it, stop that. I have lots of plans tonight. Many companies. You needn't come to my office tomorrow. I don't want to see you again. Are you okay? None of your business. Why? Why would such a perfect woman become the mistress of another man? No way. I must take her... No. I must rescue this woman. - Be careful. - Yes, I will. Where shall I put it? - Here. - Okay. Sorry that you had to work all night. Thanks for helping me to move stuff too. It's okay, I... You forget that I'm very strong. It's my pleasure. It's a very nice office. Is there anything to drink? - Yes, please wait. - Okay. I don't mind cold drinks. Show your real face now. You're a pretty secretary. What are you doing? Nothing. Thanks. Man. Stop playing games. Leave me alone, it's the climax. You pervert, you film people secretly? You know nothing. Come, try some. What is it? Just open your mouth. - What is it? - It's not that bad, is it? Try it yourself. Delicate skin. A standard dream girl. Right, I agree, this one is very sexy. Look at this. Men with mistresses, they all look like this. Bald, big belly. They think they can have mistresses since they're rich. I just want to beat these devils up. You needn't be this extreme. Don't know why there's no sound. DV cameras are always like this. Mine is the same, always fails to record the sound. But it's fine with me, I only need the pictures. This is the one from your room. Why? This is for my work. I don't have a DV camera, so I borrowed yours. Don't let me see you around, bastard. May I borrow your lighter? Sure, lighter? Thanks. Thanks? Damn you! Go to hell! You lunatic! Why are you hitting me? - Who is it? - Police. I won't spare you if you do this again! Ronald, stop! Stop! I know him. This guy is mad! He... And he... Mr. Yu is my partner. Ronald is my boyfriend. He's a policeman. I think you misunderstood. Want to do a medical checkup? I can be your witness. No need. Rachel, is he your friend? You'd better stay away from such people. Sorry, Mr. Yu, it's only a misunderstanding. Let's go. Rachel. I have something to tell you. I know all about it. Though Ronald is tall and strong, and he's a policeman, he's already married. I don't understand why you... Happiness for women... Happiness for women is simple. A home, and a man that pampers her. He goes home and enjoys the dinner she prepares. It's that simple. But if this man doesn't belong to you, he's gonna leave you one day. You're not only pretty, but competent too. You needn't force yourself for that. Say no more, I'll hang up. Drink with me tonight. I think that you're the only one in this world who understands me. Wait. - Wait. - What is it? Do you have a condom? Usually women carry them. But in Happy Valley, men carry them. What shall we do now? Go and get one. You're serious? Condoms? Thanks. Sir, the change! Shoot! I forgot which floor. What are you doing? Uncle, I'd just gone shopping and I want to get back in there. I have never seen you before. Which floor are you going? I... I rushed down to buy something, I forgot already. But I remember there's a bell on the glass door. You're an intruder! I'm not, my friend lives here. Her name is Rachel. What is her last name? You must do some homework if you want to get in here. No, I was in a hurry to get something. I must get back there now. Go away! I'll call the police if you don't! Hey, dude. Let me in! An important thing is awaiting me. Dude, I beg you, please. It's an emergency. Please let me in. Please. Let me pick these up. Let me come in, please. Man. What do you want to drink? Have you seen Rachel? No. She hasn't shown up after you got drunk that night. What's the matter? If you see her, ask her to give me a call. You can't force it. Let me give you some advice. People come here for one-night stands. Are you serious? You really fell for her? I'm in trouble. I'm in love with her. Do you know Rachel has a boyfriend? But that guy is married. So what? What era is it now? Many pretty, rich girls don't mind that at all. Rachel knows clearly what she's doing. What's going on now? When did girls of Hong Kong become like this? They don't have morals anymore. You're ancient people? Wake up, you nutcase! - There's no eternity now. - I don't believe that. I must persuade Rachel to leave that stupid cop. I can't help you if you want to be disappointed again. Ronald and I just came back from Japan. I'm going to work. Brother Leon, what would you like to drink? You decide. Brother Leon, you recognize me? I'm Linda. Who are you? I took a photo with you at the premiere. And I also shook hands with you. When will you start filming your next movie or MTV? I'm free recently, I'm willing to take up any part. I want to try different characters. The same old place? Sure, let's drink again! Drink again. Let me help you. Sister Chu Kee. What a coincidence. Come join us for supper. I wonder why you have had such bad taste lately. Why? You're in a bad mood? Sister Kee, you look so pretty today, with such good figure. How do you manage to keep fit? Do you work out a lot? You know you're a nuisance? Beat it, no paparazzi wants you. Who do you think you are? You'd better look into a mirror. I always do, Sister Kee. Come, let's go for supper. Let's eat supper. Miss, where is Nam Tong Road? Over there. Cut! Let's call it a day! Director. - Director. - What is it? - It seems you forgot a front shot. - Your front shot? No one even cares. Let's go! Wrap for the day! Pack things. Wait. - You live in Happy Valley, right? - Right. Walk home since you live nearby. Leon? - Get in the car. - Yes. Editor, ask Paul to stay and wait for the photos. There's big news. Get off. Here? Yeah, MTR station is nearby. There's taxi down there. Aren't we going for supper? You're still hungry? No. I've had enough. Go home then. Please give me a lift to Happy Valley. Get off. Editor. Nothing for tonight, it's fake news. Sorry. You're going home? You paparazzi always see movie stars? Are you friends with movie stars? It's just my job. There's no friendship. So nice of you to give me a ride. Let me tell you some news. What news? Leon will start filming a new movie. I may be the second lead actress. Are you stupid or naive? What? Stop lying to yourself. Lots of naive girls like you offer themselves to these stars. But they get dumped very soon. I wonder if he'll even remember your name the next time he sees you. Don't know what you're talking about. What generation is it now? Don't tell me you have never tried a one-night stand. Being silly once is okay. You'd better stop dreaming of being a movie star. It's none of your business. I just love sleeping with superstars. What's wrong with that? Okay. Do as you like. Delicate skin. A standard dream girl. Right, I agree, this one is very sexy. Look at this. Men with mistresses, they all look like this. Bald, big belly. They think they can have mistresses since they're rich. I just want to beat those devils up. You needn't be this extreme. Don't know why there's no sound. DV cameras are always like this. Mine is the same, always fails to record the sound. But it's fine with me, I only need the pictures. This camera is from your room. Why? This is for my work. I don't have a DV camera, so I borrowed yours. - Hello? - Bro, this is Ming. Gilbert and Pansy are fooling around in the building opposite yours. Everyone knows that, did you take any shots of that? Hey, bro. Patrick! What's wrong with you? Every newspaper reports this piece of news except us. You've made us lose face. Didn't you point your camera at Pansy's flat all the time? I always thought you could help us win the war. Tell me if you're not up to it. No, boss. This incident reveals that the instruments we have are not updated. I did charge the battery, but no power. That means the battery doesn't work. - We must buy some new instruments. - You're always like this. It's not your first time you failed. How can I stand up for you again? The big boss is really angry this time. He says he'll fire someone if sales don't improve. Tell me what to do? I promise you that I'll get you exclusive news tomorrow. And our sales will soar up instantly, Editor! Tomorrow! Why did you call me? You want everyone in Hong Kong to know you? Sure, what then? Nicholas will come here very soon. He always sits at the table in the corner. Go and sit beside him. Hey, you want me to stick to him? Let me finish, remember that you must sit at his right hand side, and ask for his autograph. - You want me to act like his fan? - Right, tell him you're his fan. Try your best to hold him up. Faye will arrive minutes later. Ask for her autograph as well. What's wrong? No... Get their autographs? That's nuts. Listen to me. Do as I say. I won't harm you. Quick. Nicholas, may I have your autograph? I like you very much! Please. - Here? - Here, thanks. You're very handsome. - Thanks. - You sing very well. - Do I? - Yes. You're so cool. You're beautiful. May I have your autograph? Go ahead. I love your songs very much. Linda. Whom did he meet first? - You or Faye? - You've got it wrong. There's nothing between me and Mr. Tse. Tell us, what do you like about Nicholas? Are you afraid to be the third wheel? No, I only asked him for an autograph. Kidding, his autograph? Stop fooling us. Look, how uncomfortable she is now. She must have a relation with him. It's you? Why? Come in. I must thank you this time. I find that your method really works. Never have I been shot by so many cameras. You want something to drink? No. I'm thinking, what shall I do next? Just do nothing. Do nothing? Showbiz is very practical. When people start to notice you, they will rush to you even if you are just sitting around. Am I really drawing people's attention now? You tell me. - A little bit. - Trust me. After this matter is stirred up, many people will offer you jobs. But remember, this is a critical moment. You mustn't take up all jobs, you must choose. Bear in mind that you mustn't take up porn movies. Even if you have no money. Everyone has his own value in showbiz. Promote yourself as chances come to you. Also, if you can, travel to Taiwan and Japan. Get an expert to improve your image. When you come back, the media will look at you totally differently. I got it now. I find that you're very smart. Not really. Experience makes one smart. I've been in this circle for years, so I understand its rules very well. Just two things. There's no smoke without fire. Rich people flock together. Remember this advice. Why did you help me? I know, because I am pretty. Because you're stupid. I don't believe that. I've said I'm pretty. I've said I'm stupid. - Hey. - Yes? This situation, you mustn't let others know. What's up? How come? - What's up? - Tell us something. STAR GOT IN BED WITH PAPARAZZI Is it real? Patrick? He's back! You are incredible. Your girlfriends are all exposed. This one is even better. They are completely nude! Patrick, a call from your dad. Tell him I'm busy. He says it's urgent. What is it, Dad? Son, many reporters have asked for you today. Really? They want your primary school photos. They want to know if you're living with her. What should I say? Don't say anything. Just don't answer anything, okay? Patrick, this is Mom. What now? The reporters are outside, I can't go get groceries. Ask our neighbor to do it for you. Patrick, we've been split up for years. Why are reporters asking me for the reason? They also asked what kind of person you are. They asked how many times you can do it in one night. You pervert! Patrick! What are you up to? Why don't you let me interview you? You let another magazine publish the inside story? My boss is really angry at me! Let me tell you what to say to the reporters. Stop it! Why come for me? You've brought me enough trouble. It's really has nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with you? Everyone finds out I used Nicholas and Faye to make up the news. They say I always use other people. How can I face anyone? That's why I want to tell you how to face the reporters. No one is as lousy as you. I wonder if you're helping me or yourself. - Are you picking on me? - Calm down. I won't listen to you! I don't want to see you! Bastard! I have nothing to do with this. Being absent-minded is my drawback. That's why Rachel hates me. I'm the real loser. I'm part of the paparazzi, but I became a target of other paparazzi. No. I'm the real loser. What do you mean? I want to vomit! - Did you say, "Thank You"? - Yes, boss. "Happy Mid-Autumn Festival" as well. So softly? No one can hear you. How many times have I said that? We must take up responsibility, and we must be polite. If one day a foreign triad boss comes to visit Hong Kong, and sees how lousy you are, you're gonna make our triad lose face. You're gonna ruin the tourism here. Watch me. - Welcome, sir. - Here. Daddy. Hi, Ivy? You have time for a drink? Okay, maybe next time. Hi, beautiful! You have time? Lots of time. If so, let's go nail some boards. Look at the camera. Cheers! Ready. Okay. - Thanks. - Thank you. Photos will be ready this time next Monday. Good. Bye. Mind your step. Thanks. NEW JAPANESE SOAP OPERA QUEEN LINDA RETURNS Sorry, we're closed. Come again tomorrow. I only want to have one photo taken. I'll pay for it. Okay. Ready. Done. You're no longer paparazzi? My father left me this shop. I used to think this place is old and outdated. But after your incident, I found that one is happier with a simple life. So I took over the shop. Very good. I can make ends meet, and I needn't work overnight. I came back to apologize to you. It's been so many years now. Just forget it. You've given me everything I have now. You got everything with your own efforts. Is it possible that we... Not in the past, and not now. You're now a superstar. And I am... I am an ordinary photographer. There are no fairy tales in this world. I've missed you all these years. Remember... It's not worth it to give up what you have now for my sake. You need to maintain your image. If there's any gossip about you, all your efforts will go in vain. Is it worth it? Right. Maybe I'll regret it later. It's good that you can think of this. I think that you can have more accomplishments as long as you can give up on love. I know that you'll be popular for a long time. Maybe all your life. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Let's pinky promise. Miss, may I help you? You only have tiramisu here? Yes. - I'd like one. - Right away. Thanks. - Hello? - Irene, are you coming? We've been waiting for you. Just go ahead. Come quick. Okay, I'll come at once. There you go. I'll go out for a moment.
