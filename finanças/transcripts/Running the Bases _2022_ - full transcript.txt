- The path that led me to this moment was not at all what I had planned for my life. See, when you embrace God's purpose, you find his provision. And you'll be amazed at just how creative our Creator can be. - Good morning, my beautiful bride. First cup? - Are the boys up? - Yeah, I think so. - My brother wants that hay in his barn today. He paid them weeks ago. - Diane, we both know you're not gonna use that. - Yeah, but they don't know that. Josh, Luke, you boys better be up. - Go, go, go. - Come on, Luke, let's go. - I'm coming, man. - You know they're going fishing, right? - They better not. - Rise and shine, Harrison. Doc's on the dial, and it's gonna be a beautiful sunny Saturday with a high of 81, so get out and do something fun today, would you? Hey, don't forget to sign up for the car show and the bakeoff next Saturday in the town square. There's always something going on, and I'm here to keep you up to date. So stay tuned for more of the community bulletin board. So get out and make it a great day, Harrison. Doctor's orders. - Okay, okay. Now can we go? - We haven't even caught anything yet. - We? - Even had had my new lighted bobber and everything. - It isn't even dark yet, you goober. - Then we ain't leaving. - Oh wait. Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. And I'm hung again. - Come on, Luke. What are we doing wrong, man? - Why are you asking him? - I mean, we're just not holding their mouths right. - Well, try closing them, then. - That'll teach you, man, that'll teach you, Jess. - My childhood best friend, Jessica, was the daughter Mama never head. - Wait till I tell Mama D. - Jess, now come on. - We're sorry, Jess. Come on, we didn't mean it. Shoot. - Jess, wait, we're sorry. - She was our biggest fan, and our biggest tattletale. - I'm so sorry. - Jess, come on. - We didn't mean it. - Jess, come back. - Baseball kept us mostly out of trouble, but when we did mess up, Mama had her ways of dealing with two rambunctious boys. And the older we got. - Glory to God. - The more embarrassing it became. - Job lost everything. He lost his wealth and he lost his health. His own wife told him, "Curse God and die." But the third thing we can learn is that no matter what we are going through, we should always keep our faith in God. Glory to God. - Amen. - Lord, we thank you for your love and your mercy and these fish that Jess caught. And Lord, forgive me and Josh for not bailing the hay. Again. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Coach says that Evangel University has a great baseball program. It's a Christian school and we could all still be together. - You already have some great opportunities. Y'all gonna mess around and they'll be gone. - We already applied. Josh mailed in our applications about a couple weeks ago. Right? - Mm-hmm. - Did you guys know there's gonna be an Evangel scout at the next game? - There is more to life than baseball. Oh, stop it, you two. Y'all know what I mean. - Okay, Mom, but first, it's pro baseball. - Pro? - Well, for me. Unless this one can get his pop time down. - Stopwatch, really? - Yeah. I mean, you need to know how bad your pop time sucks. - Oh, come on, come on. - There is nothing wrong with his pop time. - Okay, okay, I know. I'm just kidding. Every great catcher has a stopwatch, so he knows how great he really is. - Come on, Josh. Way to go. - Strike. - Come on, Josh. - Ball. Yeah, let's go. - Come on, Josh. - Cone on, Josh. - Strike. - Come on, Josh. - Come on, Josh. Do it again! - Time. - What are you doing out here, man? - Funny, I was gonna ask you the same thing. You gonna throw the pitch, or back him off the plates? - I'm setting him up. He ain't got no idea what's coming next. - Yeah, that makes two of us. - Okay. One more outside, then I'm taking my inside corner back. - All right. Just don't give me anything to hit. Mess up your no-no. - Get over there. - Strike. - Let's go, Josh. - Strike. - Come on, Josh. Bring me home, bring me home. Come on, Josh. Come on, bring it home. Bring it home. Josh. Josh? Josh! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Josh. Josh? Mom, Dad! - Josh, wake up. - Josh. - Come on. - Somebody help my son. - Call an ambulance. Call an ambulance now. - Somebody help. - Josh. - God, help. - Hey. - So what's the verdict? - You have the exact heart defect that your brother had. - So how do we fix it? - Meds can regulate it, but you shouldn't overexert yourself, Luke. - What about baseball? - I'm afraid not. - There must be some mistake. Baseball's supposed to be my future. - I'm very sorry, Luke. But your future's going to have to change. But you can live a relatively normal life. - But I wasn't planning on relatively normal. No. No. What else do you want from me? Huh? I got nothing left. I got no brother, no baseball. Nothing. This was our future. Can you hear me? Do you even see me? - Stop. Whatever that is, open it. - Dear Mr. Luke John Brooks, congratulations. Evangel College is happy to inform you that you've been accepted as a freshman in the upcoming fall semester. - Luke. - In addition, you've been awarded the prestigious T.L. Graham Scholarship, which will cover 100% of the cost of attendance over four years. - That is great news, son. - Who cares? - Don't you dare give up. Don't you take away my other boy. Look at me. I miss him, too. It's unbearable for all of us. There's not a day that goes by that I don't long to see my baby's face or hear his voice, but we are only here to get there. He ran his race. And he would so want you to finish yours. - I just miss him, Mom. I need my brother. - I know, son. I know. I know that your heart is hurting. God sees that, he hears that, and he's gonna use that for his purpose in his time, and when he does, when he does, you are going to change the world around you. - Go. - Okay, okay.

Makes everything feel right for a moment, doesn't it? - Yeah. - You know, Luke, for those of us who love this game, it's pain and glory all wrapped up together. A few of us grow to resent it, because we can't find our place in it anymore. But others, well, well, we just keep searching until we do. Well, that pop time isn't gonna improve itself. - That felt good. - Yeah, not bad for a high school backup. - You got a big mouth on you, you know? - You wanna get better? - Okay. Yeah. - Get down. Look at your feet, and get ready to throw, and when you come up, explode those hips open and get into that cocked position. - If you say so, bigmouth. - Again. Your arm path needs to be short and fast. It's all one motion. You got it? - All right. That felt better. What was that? - That is college pop time. - Whoa. Hey. Thanks, Coach. - Something inside of me came back to life, the familiar feeling of excitement about a game, and an unbreakable bond between brothers. - Come on, Josh. Come on, bring it home. Bring it home. Come on. - For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, be faithful only to her as long as you both shall live. - I do. - By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Luke, you may kiss your bride. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you Mr. and Mrs. Luke John Brooks. - I expect you to conduct yourselves in a certain way on and off the field. And your signature is your commitment to one another. Boys, you don't win a championship by trying to win a championship. You do it by picking up your teammates, and refusing to let any of them quit. If you go through my program, you will become better young ballplayers, but more importantly, you'll become better young men. All right? That's all for now. I'll see y'all at tryouts. Have a great evening. - Great speech, Coach. - Have a good night, Coach Morris. - Yeah. - See you at home, son. - See you, Dad. - May I help you, Mister? - Michael Jamison, Superintendent of the Parkwood School District, great state of Texas. - Texas. What brings you all the way to our little town, Mr. Jamison? - You do. We need a new coach. I'm looking at him. Five state titles. It's impressive. - It's nine. Nine state titles, it's- - This contract doubles your salary, not to mention, you don't have to teach during baseball season. - Is that right? - Come on, what else you gotta prove here? Talking 6A, Coach. Certainly not afraid of the competition. - It's not that. It's a very tempting offer. I just don't know what to say. - How 'bout yes? I didn't come all this way just to tell you how great you are. It's a solid offer. - It's a big decision. I got a family. My whole life's been here. I... - Yeah, I get it. I get it. Family's important. You know, I don't know your wife, but I never met a woman didn't appreciate a nicer place to life, not to mention the increased competition for your son, getting to play on a bigger stage and all. - Yeah. - You know, that's something. - It's something. - Opportunity's knocking, Coach. The door closes quickly. It's a pleasure. - Thank you, sir. - Call you in a couple of days. - What's the vibe amongst the boys out there? - Aw, Dad, you know you can't ask that. That's your rule. - Oh, you can't break your own rules, Luke. - I'm just testing the boy, playing with him. - Yeah? - And guess what? He passed. - Oh, okay. - That's good parenting. - Well you know what you get for that? - What's that? - You get to do the dishes. - Oh! - I'm serious. You're doing the dishes. - Yes, ma'am. Hey, had a very interesting visitor today. - And? And you tend to do that when you have bad news, so. - I don't really know what kind of news he is, but it's serious. It involves all of us. - Was it that guy at the field? - Yeah, that guy. - What guy? - Gentleman I met from Texas. He offered me a job, coaching at a big school in Texas. - And you turned him down, right? - Not yet. - What do you mean, not yet? - Jess, can we just talk about this before we- - Are you talking about moving? - Come on. - Dad. - You're serious? - I'm a junior in high school. I'm finally getting the opportunity to play varsity ball on the same field you and Uncle Josh played on. I mean, the same field that he... - I understand that's important to you, son, it's important to me too, okay? - Yeah, but Dad. - Let's just talk about this. - Seriously, what is there to talk about? You wanna move to Texas? - This isn't fair. - This is all I've ever known, this town, I- - What if we're done here? Did you ever think about that? This is an amazing opportunity for me. Coach Morris is more than ready to take over this team. What else is there to do here? - I don't know, win another championship, or retire in our hometown, Luke. - Jess. Sweetheart, you know I don't do this for championships. Lately, I feel like God's been trying to get my attention about something. - How long have you been feeling that? - Every time I would sit down to plan for the season. I feel like God's been saying, wait. And I didn't understand what that meant until now, and then this job offer comes out of the blue. All I'm saying is that maybe this is the opportunity God has me waiting for. Otherwise, it's like... I don't know, like we're... - I know, like we're saying no to God. - Yeah. Come here. I need you guys. I need you. - You got us. Together. - You ready? Look. I know you miss Harrison, son. Okay, I do, too. But you're gonna be just fine. - Dad, they've already had tryouts. I'm not gonna be playing baseball this season. - Son, I wouldn't have moved you down here without taking care of a few details. You're on the team. - What? But I didn't even try out. - Don't worry about it. Just wait till they get a load of you. - But it's 6A, Dad. Do you think I'll be good enough? - Son, I ain't talking about baseball. - What are you talking about? - You'll see. Just gotta trust them pretty blue eyes of yours. - Oh, okay. - And the bangs. - Yeah. - I wish I could do that with my bangs. Have a good day, son. - Thanks, Dad. - Somebody needs to tell Rick to quit bringing food into the announcer's box. Hey, there he is. - Morning, gentlemen. - Coach Brooks. It's good to see you. This is Ted, your Booster Club president. - Coach, I cannot tell you how glad I am to finally to get to meet you. - Pleasure, sir. - Assistant Coach, Cage Tyson. - Nice to meet you, Coach Tyson. - Nice to meet you. - Over here moping in the corner is our athletic supporter and Head Football Coach, Alex Kenny. - That's just not funny anymore. - Now I'd agree with you, but we'd both be wrong. Wouldn't we? - Coach Kenny. - Our principal, Charlie Rogers. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Rogers. - It's nice to meet you, Coach Brooks. - I love your neighborhood here, it's. Sorry, that's a horrible joke. You probably get all the time, and oh, I wasn't trying to make a joke. - He's funny, too, right, guys? - Sure. - Well, I told you I'd get him here. Here he is. - Here I am. - Our hope for our first championship win. - Hold on, now. Championship. I think you and I are on different pages. We should probably talk. - Coach Brooks, can I call you Luke? - Of course. - You just focus on winning. - Yeah, but I haven't even met the team yet, and our first game's like a week away. - Well, we better get on that. You're my man. - No pressure, Luke. Welcome to 6A! - Who we got at third base? - Ryan Jamison. Pitches and plays third. He can run like a three-legged camel. But he can hit a baseball a mile. - Copy that. Steal signs for... Did you say Jamison? - That's exactly what you're thinking. He's a handful. He's not a bad kid, but his imagination's a little destructive. - So where's our game field at? - You're standing on it. - You're kidding me. You telling me we play on a city park? - Welcome to Parkwood ISD, where football gets all the money. - I was gonna ask you about that. What's the deal with Coach Kenny? - Like I said, football is big here, and he wants to keep it that way. Plus, those are some of his players out there. - Hmm. Hey, son. - I'm ready, Dad. - All right. Excuse us, Coach. - Absolutely. - I'm Coach Brooks, and I love this game. Now the world will tell you that it's all about winning. And that's what they expect from us. Now don't get me wrong, I wanna win. I came here to win and I will demand greatness from each and every one of you on this field. But greatness ain't defined by winning. Greatness is so much more than that. It's how you conduct yourselves on this field and off this field. It's about emptying yourself for your teammates. See, I expect us to become a family, a family of young men who carry themselves with character and integrity. You achieve that, you boys are welcome to win all you want. - Hey Coach, we heard your old team won the state championship. - Nine times to be exact. - I heard it was five. - What was that? - I heard it was five? - Five, huh? It was nine, Mr. Jamison, right? - Ryan, and my dad, he's- - I know who your father is. Don't expect any special treatment because of it. - Y'all seen my pride? It was here just a second ago. - All right, give me four laps, and keep yourselves within reach of the fence, or you'll all start over. - Four laps? Are you kidding? - Run! - Okay, okay. - Get out there, you lazy Lima bean. You okay, sir? - Sam, Sam! Sam, you scared of a little ol' bee, man? - That thing was as big as a pancake. - Oh, really? Doesn't look that big to me. - Get on me, go on, get off. That's not funny, man. - That was pretty good. - That is not funny. - Hi there. - Samuel Parker. My friends call me Sam. - Okay. - Right now, you're not my friend. - Coach Luke Brooks. - Pleasure, Coach. You know, I have seen a lot of baseball seasons come and go around here. - Yeah. - But there's something special about this one. - And what do you think's so special? - Mm. You! You. - Hey, Mom! - Hey! So, how'd it go? - Pretty good. - Yeah? - Yeah. I just think I need to work on my first impressions. - Okay. - You look cute. - Thanks. It was a good day, sweetie? - Um. - Oh, ew, man. - Yeah, it was a good day. It was actually pretty good. - I think I might know why. - What? - A girl at the school is pretty sweet on our boy. - Oh, all right. I mean, look at him. - Pretty cute. - Yeah. Let's talk about it over dinner. Look, y'all, all these places deliver. - Get out. - Delivery to our home. - All right. - I mean, I think I'm gonna like Texas. - I told you. And then I realized what I said, and he didn't- - You didn't say that to him. - Well, not on purpose. - Dad. - Oh my gosh. He probably gets that all the time. - I know. - Mm, Dad, tell Mom about Ryan. - Oh, yeah, we got the superintendent's son, Ryan that's a real piece of work, cracking jokes. He looked at me like, Coach, four laps! You trying to kill me? Here, you take over for me. - All right. - Ready, son? - Yes, sir. - Lord, help us today, help us to play for you. - Welcome to the Parkwood Lions season opener, and we'd like to thank Outstanding Light Funeral Services for their sponsorship of today's game. Outstanding Light Funeral Services is located on 12th Street across from Gotta Go Containers, your number one choice in quality caskets. Huh. - All right, listen up, guys. Trust yourselves out there on the field, all right? Everybody here, they want you to win. I just expect you to do your best. You understand? - Yes, sir. - But you gotta look good doing it.

I'm talking about the wins. - Oh. - What's that, 6 and 0? - Yeah, 6 and 0. - Well, it's impressive. - Boys are playing good. - You know, I was thinking that with a winning program, you deserve nicer things. - Thanks to you, the jersey are an improvement. - Nah, you're thinking too small. I'm thinking much bigger. You know, something like champions live here. I'm just saying that with winning comes great rewards like a brand new stadium, for instance. You just keep winning. - Next week, I'll start working one on one with a few of you. Jamison, you're losing two steps on your leadoff. Okay, you ain't slow, son, you're just lazy. - Come on, Coach. We all know he's slow. - That's enough, all right. We also need a lot more pitching. So Whitmore, it's time we tame that arm, son. - Yes, sir. - Paul, that means you'll be playing first base. We're gonna work on your confidence, too, with the play, so you can help this team. Boys, it's the small things, the details that make the difference on this field. Winning the championship's gonna require more out of each of you. And if you apply yourselves, boys, you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish on this field. You understand? - Yes, sir. - Bring it in. Let's go, Lions on three, here we go. One, two, three. - Lions! - Hey, Ryan, check it out. - You guys seeing this? - You know what's crazy is Coach is faster than Josh. - Hey, Ryan, when they get over here, you should ask him what all that running's about. - Nah, man, I'm not gonna do that. - Hey, come, just ask him. - Okay, fine, fine, fine, I will. - Good work today, boys. I'll see you at home, Brooks. - All right, see you, Dad. - Love you, Coach. - Hey, Josh. So we've all been wondering, what's with the, you know, the running of the, you know? My dad says it's some sort of baseball superstition. - Oh, no, no, it's not a superstition. No, my Uncle Josh, he had a heart defect, and he died during a game. And so my dad runs the bases in honor of God and in memory of his brother, and I join him sometimes occasionally, you know, and we pray. - Yeah, that sounds superstitious. - Sounds like the same thing. - I was thinking it, you know. - Sounds pretty lame to me. - Oh, does it? Does it, Cody? - Yeah. - Your face is lame. So Josh, that means that you're named after your uncle then. - I am, yeah. I just wish I was half the ballplayer he was. - Me too. Hey. - God, spare me. Yeah, lame. - Oh, ho, ho. This just in, ladies and gentlemen. Let's check in with our lame judge for the afternoon, Mr. Casanova Garrison. Tell us, Casanova, was that story lame enough for you? What's your verdict? - My verdict is that you're an idiot, and by the way, Danielle thinks you're an idiot, too. - Ooh. - Wanna go there, boss? - Let's go there. - Hey, Josh, what's the latest with you and Katie? - Ryan, you know. We're going out on a date tonight. - Oh, really, a date, huh? Have you met her parents yet? - Yes. They invited me over for dinner the other night, but you already knew that. - Sorry, I just needed to be reminded. This just in, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Josh Brooks wins the heart of lovely Ms. Katie Harper in just under a month. Tell us, Casanova Garrison, after two years of trying to get a date with Katie, have you ever seen the inside of the Harper home? Check, check, is this thing on? - Hey, Tristan, turn me up, buddy. - Thank you. - Hey, you're not funny, Ryan. - Hey, man, you need calm- - You need to grow up. - Yeah, calm down, all right. - Hey, you both need to grow up, all right? Take a step back. - I'll grow up when Casanova grows up, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Man, chill out. - Get off me, man. - Man, Cody, you get played so easy. - You don't know anything about me. - He knows you hit like a girl. - Shut up, Ryan. - All right, all right, all right. - You know what? At least I am not named after some stupid dead ballplayer with a bad heart. - Yo, dawg, chill, bro. Come on, chill out, chill out, chill out. Break it up, break it up. Man. - So Katie, tell us about yourself. - Um, okay, well, I'm really just your average Texas girl. I love to go to church, and listen to music, and go shopping. - How 'bout that, Jessie, she just described you. - Well, I'm just a regular ol' Texas girl, now, aren't I? - That's right. - Wait, I'm sorry, sorry. Did you say average? - Yeah. - Mom, she's the reigning district tennis champion. - Oh my, Josh! - Wow! - It's amazing. - That's wonderful. - Thank you. - Look who's here. - Oh man. - What's up, Coach? - What you doing? - Hey, is this the missus, 'cause I don't like keeping secrets. - That's because he can't keep a secret. - Boys, this is my wife, Jessica. - Hi, boys. - And this is Jerry. - Hello, Mrs. Brooks. - Hi, Jerry. - And this is Cameron. - What's up, Ms. Brooks, how are you? - Nice to meet you. - And this is Ryan. - Hey. - Ryan, like the Ryan Jamison? - At your service. - Yeah, that's him. - Okay. - Do you mind if I- - Wow. I see it now. Okay, help yourself. Oh. - Josh, how'd the date go with Katie? Hi, Katie. - They're still on the date, you idiot. Oh, hey, Katie. - Hey, Cameron. - Yeah, you mind if you ask me about that tomorrow? After the date? - Yeah, am I hearing all nighter at Coach's house? - Yep, yep. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. All nighter? Who said anything about an all-nighter? I did not say that. He didn't say that. - I think it sounds fun. - Really? Yeah. - All these boys in our house? - Yeah. - Okay. - We can grill, it'll be fun. Y'all come over. - Sweet. - What do you think, like 6:00? - Sure. - Bring your sleeping bags. - Perfect. - Okay, y'all come over, but we go to church on Sundays. - Ooh. - Oh. I sleep in on Sundays. - We worship the Lord on Sundays. - We can reconsider. Whoo. Hey. - You going somewhere? - I was just gonna go spend the night at Josh's. - Oh, Coach Brooks' son? - Yeah. Yeah, they're a cool family. - What are you gonna do? - You know, just play some video games, grill some burgers, go to shmurch. - What was that? - Huh? - Last thing you just said. - Video games? - No, the very last part. - Burgers for dinner? - Never mind. - Okay. See you later. Hey, don't forget to eat something, all right? - Mm-hmm. - Love you, Dad. - Dude, all she said was you're not attractive, could be- - No. I'm getting a six pack this summer. I'm telling you, I'm doing juices. Guys, let's just not mess around, all right? We don't wanna break anything in Coach Brooks' house. - Oh, like the time when you threw the baseball in Cameron's parents' window. - Yeah. - Yeah, what's up- - But look, if you knew how to catch, we wouldn't have a problem, okay? - But what about the time when you knocked the candle over at CJ's house? - Yeah. - I mean, you caught the curtains on fire. - Okay, but I put the fire out, right? And curtains are supposed to be fireproof. They say it in all the- - Hey, Ryan, I'm not so sure my curtains are fireproof, so should I be worried here or? - I was just telling the guys, this is a beautiful home, excuse me. Josh, you here? - Hey, Ms. Brooks. - Thanks, guys. Y'all come on in. Coach is grilling. I'll show you where to put your stuff. - Thanks. - All right, y'all have fun. - Yes, ma'am. - Coach. - All right. - What's up, Coach? - What's up, boys? - Hey, Coach. - What about this one? When was this taken? - That was the Mother/Son dance back home. He cleans up pretty nice. - I never got to dance with my mom. She died when I was six. - I'm sorry about that. I lost my mom when I was little, too. It's hard. - Yeah. - You better go get some barbecue. - Okay. - Have some fun with those boys. - Yeah. If there's not at least three burgers left for me, I'm gonna be frustrated. I'm just putting it out there. What's up, du
