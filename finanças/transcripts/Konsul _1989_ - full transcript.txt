Before the film, please, hear this announcement. The Wroclaw Police at the order of the Provincial Prosecutor in Wroclaw, is investigating the case of criminal activity of Czeslaw Wisniak, also known at false names: Witold Srodecki and Jacek Ben Silberstein. Czeslaw Wisniak has a long criminal record... - in the period... - Oh, you... acting on the territory of the whole country he wangled out large amounts of money. and also committed other serious crimes. - Wait, you... - The persons harmed by Czeslaw Wisniak and the persons, who have any information about his criminal activity... Why are you staring like that? What are you waiting for? Run to him! I will do it for sure. And now, please, stay tuned for our film. Silberstein has been caught! Silberstein has been caught! I heard it on the radio. - What? Let's call the police. I've got the number. I'll squeeze it out from his throat, pull it out from his guts. He worked here very short. Laid off after two weeks. Dismissed for disciplinary reasons. But he took from us a loan for settling down. - We implemented his improvement scheme. - No schemes. But these were good savings on the material. No savings. None. Yes? Yes, comrade secretary, I've heard the news. No, I didn't inform them. He was just a regular patient here. I understand. We didn't have such a patient at all. I asked you to keep it in secret. - I asked, didn't I? - Yes, but everybody knows it. So what if they know. Does it have to be written? - But actually, nothing happened here. - Nothing? His lawyer will say the same. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR THE CONSUL MUSIC DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY SCREENPLAY AND DIRECTED BY Hereby the session in the case of Czeslaw Wisniak is open. The son of Zygmunt and Joanna Golab, - born on January 23rd... - I do protest. Defendant Wisniak, you're instructed to be seated. I'm not Wisniak. Defendant Wisniak, tell the court the date and place of your birth - and the name of your father - My name is Jacek Ben Silberstein born in Vienna, the son of Aaron and Inga Vontz. Where is the interpreter? Conselor, do you know your client? Perhaps you will introduce him to us? - Your Highness... - The interpreter. I need translation. I don't speak Polish, I speak German. I live in Vienna, Austria, in 7 4 Prater Strasse. We have here the expert evaluation... Dactyloscopic... The fingerprints from the index finger and the thumb, the third and the fourth fingers of the right hand present the dextrorotatory patterns. As far as the pattern and characteristic features are concerned, the prints from the file of Jacek Ben Silberstein, match the prints from the file filled out by Czeslaw Wisniak. I don't know, who Czeslaw Wisniak is. I am an Austrian diplomat. My name is Jacek Ben Silberstein. The defendant is making his situation worse. I'd like to ask High Court's forgiveness, 'cause I can't control myself. So the defendant admits, that his name is Wisniak and not Silberstein? I do admit. Although, for many in this room it would be better, if I didn't admit it. What's the matter, Wisniak? The spring has come, sergeant. Get down to work. Yes, sir. - Some car. - Have you seen the bitch? - Why ''the bitch''? A woman. - I'd like to have one like her. - I have a better one. - In your dreams. - Such a car is also no problem. - And what else? What do you mean ''what else''? A desk in own office, a secretary... Wisniak! Prisoner Wisniak reports. Read it, Czesiek. I've been waiting for it. So, when we'll see each other again? No, this time I won't come back. - I'll tell them to keep your place. - It will stay empty. And you know, that there is crisis. How was it with these exams, you were doing your time for? Now you can tell me. We took the money from the parents before the exams. One doctor knew the results, before they were announced. If a kid passed - I would say it's been arranged, otherwise - that it didn't work out. We would pay all the money back. We will miss you here. Go Czesiek, go. With these exams - I didn't make any promises, Good morning. I'd like the same design, but in leather. We don't carry leather merchandise. Czesiek. I came out yesterday. Right away, I came to you. After all that's happened? I'll explain you everything, Anka. You won't explain anything. It's too late. I'll find a job right away. I've got some savings. You can't cross me out from your life. I wish you luck. Don't count for anything else. Hello. How much are these black pants for? - Five each. - I'll take five of the same design. - The same? - Yes. Five pairs. - Hell, I have merchandise. - Me, too. All right. - How much are they? - Two, two and a half. - Two each? - Yes. But I don't deal in retail. - So what is it about? - Wholesale. 1 00 pairs. I don't have that much on me. - Me neither. - So how is it gonna be? In Grand Hotel. At 5 pm. At the restaurant. You wanna give presents? - So little for such a merchandise? - Cool down. It's not that little. I'll give twice as much and still earn on it. - You only know how to spend money. - You know, how much are these pants? Leave it. It's my merchandise and I'll do with it, what I want. You're a complete loser. What he's giving you is no money at all. How is it? Not going well? She's cleaned me out and is still bitching. So, what is it gonna be? Perhaps it is too little. I'll give you 200 and won't ask, where does this loot come from. No, not now. - So what is it about? - The merchandise is in the room. But it is not hers. We've made a deal. All right. Let's go upstairs. It's here. Shit... it'd be better, if she didn't see, how much money I took. Count it. All right. I know, anyway, I'm giving it for free. Don't enter. Get out, please. - She's half naked. - See? Damn her. I'll give her a piece of my mind. Hello! Open up, please. Open up! Fucking shit! - No need, Czesiek. - Give back the key. - Anka? - Yes? - There is a summons to you. - Read it. ''You're asked to be in person on 05.06 for the participation in the one-day workshops in the clothes trading. Ignoring the summons will result in penalty or the cancellation - of the license. - Probably new regulations. Fucking green light! They don't mention it, that you lose a whole day. No need for anger. I'll go for the training and you'll stay in the shop. A guy tricked me for money for 1 00 pants. And now this. Anka. Hi. So we meet after all. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Wait... let's talk. I can't. I'm late for the training. What training? For sure it's been cancelled. I'm telling you. So it was you, who sent the summons. I just wanted to see you. What for? Who are you pretending to be now? - Those pants were also your trick? - I really wanted to see you. Run away, Czesiek! Did the witness know, who deceived her husband? Yes. So why didn't you tell your husband about it? The defendant... Czesiek did all this for me. Wisniak cheated your husband out of 200.000 and you're saying, he did it for you? I understood... I understood then, that I still love him. He always wanted to live a normal life. But he had no conditions for that. Leave this suitcase, please. Hi. So... You look as if you had robbed a luxury store. They gave me somebody else's bag, why letting me out from prison. How is it going? When did you come out? A week ago. On parole. Can I stay at your place for few days? Well... All right. Just don't mention, we were doing time together. My woman won't leave me in peace. I won't say a word. I wasn't in prison. Janka, we've got a guest. My friend. We haven't seen each other in long time. - This is my wife, Janka. - Good evening. Mr. and Mrs. Zielinsky, and this is my friend, Czeslaw. Excuse me. Andrzej, please, come with me. - Janka... - Good evening. Again some criminal. Janka! He's not a criminal! Janka! - It's a stupid situation. - You'll entertain him yourself. Either him, or me. You know, how it is. - Sit down. - Sorry for coming with no notice. No problem. Have you been to the football game with Holland? - When? - Last year, in Chorzow. No, I wasn't. I saw a guy there, who resembled you very much. I thought, it was you. I waved at the guy, shouted, but... no reaction. I wanted to go there, but due to some circumstances, I wasn't able to. How can one be mistaken. You're just passing by through Katowice? No. Actually, I came here to look for a job. What's your profession? An engineer. Graduate of Mining Engineering Academy. 1 0 years of work in the faculty, doctor's degree almost in hand... What was all that for? The salaries are miserable at the Academy? No, actually, not. My wife has left me. The apartment was hers... Only here in Silesia I can find an apartment and work. Do you already have something? No. Some small company would be best. The less thinking, the better. At my work, there are many vacancies. Are there? I'm sorry. I haven't said ''hello'' to you, yet. No problem at all. Czeslaw Wisniak. What are these vacancies, Mrs. Janka? Sorry, may I call you this way? You were funny, with this doctor's degree. What was I to say? That I've got only high school education? Are you up to something now? I'm looking for a job. I have to land on my feet. It's the last one. I don't want to go back there, either. Excuse me. I made a bed for Mr. Czeslaw in the small room. The towel's on the bathroom door. But, please, don't drink more, cause you won't get anything done. - Why not? - The manager doesn't like it. He's a teetotaller. - Good night. - We're calling it a day, Mrs. Janka. Good night. A teetotaller. He must have been training a lot in this sport. Czesiek... don't get Janka involved in anything. No way. I just have to know, who I'll be working with. That's here. - It looks very nice from outside. - Yes, very nice. Very pleasant. That's, what I have imagined. This man getting out of Fiat is our secretary, Novak. Oh, yes. Zielinski was telling about him. The manager isn't here yet. I don't see his car. Will you wait in my front office? No, I won't disturb you. I'll look around. Think a little. Anyway, it's too early for arranging such matters. - Did you get discouraged by my stories? - Not at all. It's very nice. I feel like I'm working here already. See you later. See you. Hello? Is it the Union? Hello? Is it the Union? It's Nowak speaking, the first party secretary from Polspom. I'd like to speak to director Antonowicz. Antonowicz speaking. Good morning, comrade director, it's Novak, 1 st party secretary from Polspom. I don't know, if my name rings a bell to you. Yes, it does. Go on. There is a matter, which concerns comrade director. It's a little hard to speak about it on the phone. May I come over? There's no need. Go on, don't feel shy. It's about the body, that we've made for your car. But not only that. - The body, you say? - Yes. - I don't understand. - I'd like you to get me well, director. I've got... very strong ties... with director Lugowski. But what is it with that body? Can you be clearer? Director Lugowski unnecessarily speaks about it. And he mentions your name on this occasion. This makes a bad impression, especially, after drinking alcohol. Lugowski doesn't drink alcohol. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. I'm calling off record. I may not speak at all. Don't get offended. I understand you. This teetotaller's club is just a fiction. And there's nobody to work in the company. The work is organized very bad, the posts are vacant. - Even the post of the main technician. -These are serious accusations. What's the matter with this technologist? We've raised that at the meeting, there were some propositions, just to fill in that post, but it looks like the director is waiting for his cousin, or friend. I understand. Just wait a moment. Put me through to Lugowski from Polspom. All right, comrade, we'll see, what can be done. We can't work one-sidedly. Anyway, thanks for the hint. And call me, if there are any other problems. Yes, I'll remember, of course. Thank you for your trust. Thank you. I'm back, Mrs. Janeczka. You're so elegant. So you've made up your mind. I'll try. Could you announce me with the director? It's better not today. Someone called from the Union. There's some scandal. Oh, that's even better. He can make up his mind faster. Get Novak down here. At once. Sorry for interrupting Mr. Director. I'm coming about the job. I've heard there is a vacancy. Must you bother me? Go to the personnel department. Haven't I told you? Excuse me. I've been sent here by director Antonowicz. - Hasn't he called here? - Antonowicz? - From the Union. - Come in, please. Please. - Lugowski. - Wisniak. Come in, please. Director called here today, but he didn't mention you at all. Because I didn't tell him, I'm going to Katowice. - We can call him. - There's no need. Please, take a seat. Thank you very much. In what position would you like to work in our company? Director Antonowicz mentioned it to me once... that you don't have the main technologist. Oh yes... indeed... You could start even today. I'd rather start next week. I'd like to pop in to the Union. Will you be at director's Antonowicz? Yes. I've got some business that needs to be arranged there. I understand. Good morning. Did you want to see me, Mr. Director? Oh yes, do come in. Let me introduce you... Our new main technologist... Mr. Novak, the secretary of the Party organization. - Novak. - Engineer Wisniak. - Pleased to meet you. - All the pleasure is mine. - Mrs. Janeczka... - My God, what beautiful flowers... - Who are they for? - For you. Thanks to you I have a job. - I'm very glad. - From the main technologist. I've never got such flowers. Look at these beautiful flowers. Andrzej, you're not trying hard. I've asked you to keep Janka out of it. What are you talking about? It's a legal number. I'm going to Cracow for my graduation diploma. - Good morning. - Good morning. A lot has changed for you, Mr. Master of Science. Please, you're interrupting the classes, sir. You even haven't visited me through all these years, doctor. I must have been very busy. I see... Mr. Doctor had an idea and Wisniak... Let's get out. Of course. You were in prison for reoffending and old sentences, - but not for this case. - Really? Actually, why am I covering for you so much? - What do you want? - A graduation diploma. - What? - A certificate, I've graduated from the Academy. That's impossible. Can't be done. What if I remember, who was selling exams with me? You don't even know, what you're demanding. I can arrange, that you'll be taken to the Academy, but not a graduation. I'd need the paper, all the signatures. I don't need the original. A copy will do. - A copy needs also a form. - Then a copy of a copy. Just a stamp is important. Sorry, but I have to go back to the class. I didn't falsify the exam results. All these students just passed the exams. I was earning almost nothing then. And the students parents were very grateful, that they could do something for their children. Nobody will believe you now. They won't? Let's check it. See you at the court. Czeslaw! Excuse me. May I come in? Please, come in, dear colleague. - So... we're starting. - Yes, Mr. Director. - Please, take a seat. - I've got here everything. Here. This is my application, cv... work certificate, recommendation and the diploma. Actually, this should go to the personnel department. But I can forward it there. It will be faster. Oh, my! What a coincidence! We have similar specialization. Do we? Really? They've put it in my diploma. Actually, I was doing something else. Really? I was in individual program. That's why you got an A in diploma. I only got a C. Janeczka! Bring two coffees, please. I allowed myself for inviting the managing board of the company, in the person of Mr. Director and the chief of the Party organization. And also all the managers of the departments, so that this symbolic glass of brandy... so that this symbolic glass of brandy marked the good beginning of our future cooperation. Mr. Engineer... Dear colleagues. I'd like personally and also on behalf of the whole crew to welcome engineer Wisniak in our company. We have great hopes for engineer Wisniak. Engineer Wisniak was in the faculty of the Mining Academy in Cracow and he came here recommended by Director Antonowicz from the Union, as an eminent specialist. Mr. Engineer, welcome. Bye, Marian, thank you very much. It was very nice. Thanks for the ride, too. I'd like to thank you. No problem, really. - Czesiek, I don't drink at all. - I know, of course. - How did you settle in here? - Good, just for the time being. - I'm renting a room. Good. - It doesn't matter. Apply for a credit for settling in. I will support it. All right. I'll never forget this favor. Bye. Bye. Czesiek! We'll think about the apartment as well. Good. I'm sorry. - Czesiek! Your bag. - I'd forget it. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. Hello? Hi, Anka. It's Czesiek speaking. Good morning. I'd like to thank you. You saved me then. I regret, that I've done it. Ania, perhaps we'd meet somehow? - We'd talk in peace. - No. I can't. I have work now. I live in Katowice. I'm trying to settle down. I'm a technologist in Polspom. The main technologist. - Soon, I'll get an apartment. - Czesiek... Don't call me anymore. Hallo? Anka! Why are you sitting in such darkness? Are you moving out? I've overstayed my welcome here. Where will you live? I don't know yet. Maybe, I'll just quit all this and leave. You're not feeling good here? No, I'm not. You know, that it's not like that. But what's happened? Mr. Czesiek, why? Why do I need all this? What for? You have a job, you'll get an apartment. You can't look back. Who needs me at all, Mrs. Janka? Who? Me, for that matter. It must be... some misunderstanding. Is it? Where to? Where is the money? If I owe you anything, I'll give it back, but... not here. Let's go. - Andrzej, listen, there's a problem... - Wait. But... I don't want to see you here anymore, you shit. Damn it. I don't understand, what's happened. Perhaps you'll take a jacket or my watch. I really don't have this money now. - Take him by the hands! - But, gentlemen! Hiring Wisniak was like an official order. He came with enough recommendation. Besides, his graduation diploma was great, too. Did the level of engineering knowledge of Mr. Wisniak seem to you also adequate? I didn't feel authorized to pass judgement on his knowledge. Wisniak had been recommended by the director of the Union. We have here the statement signed by director Antonowicz. The only issue, he discussed with you on the phone was your alcoholism. I don't drink alcohol at all. On that day I also did not understand the purpose of our conversation. So you did not participate in the celebration on the occasion of Mr. Wisniak being hired? I'm withdrawing my ealier testimony. I'll repeat my question. How did it happen, that you hired Wisniak? I don't know. But I don't have to know it anymore. I've started an earlier pension. It's 8.00 a. m. Here's the morning news. ''Today we're building tomorrow''. Such was the motto of the meeting of the Party and the social activists in Warsaw, of the meeting of the Party and the social activists in Warsaw, which was presided by the member of the political bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish Worker's Party PZPR, comrade Jerzy Markowicz. ''We assume that, it's essential not to pass bills, but to realize them in a complex and decisive manner. Spreading and deepening the work with the masses is the key to further achievements. '' That's how comrade Markowicz concluded the activists' debate. Hello. Sir? Please, open your eyes. Do we know anything about him? Nothing. he was found by the Katowice highway. - Any documents? - None. He was in his underwear. Yes... Did he vomit? No. - Traces of alcohol? - Not found. - Has the police been informed? - Yes. He reacted. What's your name? Can you hear me? Can you see me? All right. Let's continue. The patient's card. Doctor! You've decided to speak. Do you remember, what's happened to you? I'd like to speak to the director of the hospital. All right. Just tell me, what's happened to you. Sir! I need to speak to the manager of the hospital. This is the patient, Mr. Director. You've got, what you wanted. - I'd like to inform comrade about something. - Yes, go on. But I cannot say it aloud. - Carefully, director. - All right. Let's go, doctor. Everything's explained. Thank you for taking the effort to come. Comrade secretary. What's the matter? First of all, I'd like to ask you to be discreet about it. - No names in any case. - And the interrogation? No, no interrogation. I hold no grudges against anyone. Just don't inform my brother for the time being because of... I understand. What does comrade secretary think about it? It's hard to say right away. I can't remember, where I've met him. - He recognized you right away. - I guess... it could have been at the training in Warsaw. His air and manner, you know... - resembles his brother. - But he's of lower rank. It's interesting, what's his profession. I'd be careful. This affair. Being beaten up by the jealous husband. What do you think? The people, who rule, are different than us? Such things happen everywhere. I wouldn't like to be in this husband's shoes, now. Oh, gosh. His sheets don't look too clean. It would use to change them. Exactly. And I'll tell them to put the toilet paper in the restrooms. Thank you. How about the medicines? - The biggest problem are the medicines. - Don't exaggerate. It's not that bad. - But you've seen our order. - You want too many imported medicines. We should use more natural methods. As the farmers say: ''If he's supposed to get well, he'll get well, anyway. And if he's to die, he'll die, anyway. What's this? You're making jokes? - We can gain a lot for our city. - And for the hospital, of course. Take him to No.: 6, him-to No.: 5... - And him-to No.: 7. - All the beds are taken there. Put in more. And him - to the corridor. - Why to the corridor? - There's no room for another bed. Ok then - he'll be discharged from the hospital. But doctor... I'll be discharged? I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we need to have disinfection here. Such is the order of the Sanitary Inspection. - What's this? - Soup. Soup? Where did you take it from? From the pot. Don't give him this soup. Can I give it to other patients? Don't ask me stupid questions. I've brought you some books And this television set. I don't understand. There's so much going on in the country, we thought, you want to follow it. Oh, yes. Of course. Thank you very much. I think, the best spot will be here. A little bit further. More to the right. That's good. My duties are calling. If you need anything, just ask. - Doctor... - Yes? I wouldn't like to promise anything. Just make the list of things, which are most necessary. We'll see, what can be done. I told this lady, she cannot enter here. Anka. I found your papers in the house. Roman told me, where they left you. Come over here. I know, it's all because of me. Czesiek... - Are you Okay? - I'm all right. Why are you all alone in this room? And you've got television? Oh, you... Again you landed on four feet. Ania... And I was so scared, that you were dead. Calm down, please... Calm down. How did you find me here? I was calling the emergencies. They told me, where they had found you. - Everything fit in. - Did you tell them my name? I did. Oh, shit. You must help me get out from here. They don't know, who I am. - They think I'm Markowicz's brother. - What Markowicz? The one from the political bureau. Jesus Christ. - Oh, hello mister. - Hello. I see, you're regaining your health fast. Yes... It's a good hospital, but it looks like I overestimated my strength. - I'll help you. - There's no need. I'll manage by myself. I don't know, who you are, but for sure you're not Markowicz's brother. - Pardon me? - Markowicz has no brother. I've checked it. If that's true, why won't you arrest me? Oh, no. I've got no right to be there alone. Put me in the corridor, like an honest man. Enough of this bullshit! Markowicz's brother's been here and he'll leave this hospital. You've got wife and children? One more word and we'll speak in a different way. - So what is this about? - You'll tell them, you want to leave. I'll tell the director, that I've been speaking to your brother. Tomorrow we'll meet for a farewell coffee at the senior registrar. And then... we'll forget about everything. Your Honor! I admire... the storytelling skills of the defendant... but I'd like to emphasize it strongly... that nothing like this has ever happened. These are just mere slurs, which aim at discrediting the local authorities. But the documents show it clearly, that such a patient was in your hospital. I won't deny it, Your Honor. Many times we had to hospitalize regular drunkards. They are most often the victims of such accidents. After few days, they are discharged. So, you're saying that the defendant was treated like other patients, wasn't he? It wasn't me, who started this scandal. But when you can't arrange for anything in a normal way... then every way is good. Wait. Czesiek. Czesiek? What are you doing? Everything's all right. Go on sleeping. Where did you get it from? What do you need this ID for? We'll go to Otwock and you'll see. But... I don't want it this way... I want us to be together. One must work for honesty. Without an apartment, money and few things we won't manage. I really can't live this way. Please, understand it. You can. I know, you can. Just a little prank. Nothing big. Oh, that's him. Fast. Slowly, slowly. Now slow down. It must have been somewhere here. I don't know. I don't remember, which house that was. Can I help you somehow? No, no. Thank you. You're too young. But what do you need? I know everybody here. Do you know the name Mitura? Yes. He used to live here during the German occupation. I don't remember exactly. It must have been Mitura. My name is Mitura. Perhaps you're looking for my father. There are no other Mitura here. Is he alive? He is. My brother! My dearest brother! Dear brother, I thought, I'll never pay him back. Wait... What is it about? Why? He helped me through the war. I was a child then. Please, come in. - Maria, come here quick! - What happened? - Marcin, go and fetch Grandpa. - What's going on? - What a coincidence. - Excuse me. Excuse me... But it wasn't here like this. The door was here. And here it's different, as well. I'm sorry. Hasn't the house been rebuilt? Everything could have been changed. That's true. Everything was different here. I don't remember. I don't understand. Don't let on to him. Come on. Let's go. Daddy. My savior. Do you remember me? No. You gave him the hiding during the German occupation. Now, you're save with that. You can admit it. Oh, yes. During the occupation? It was a long time ago. Why should I remember that? Dad! You don't have to kiss my hands. Dear friends. The good fate wanted it this way, that after 30 years I'd meet here my savior. The good fate wanted, that the most beautiful day of my life I would spend together with you. In two days, I won't be here. I'm moving to Germany. In my bank account in Warsaw I have 1 0.000 $. I'd like to live something behind me here... Please, don't be offended, accept half of it. - How can I help you? - I'd like to open - a bank account. - You must fill in these forms. The signature sample, orders of payment, application for opening a dollar account. There are exemplary forms on the tables. - What is the minimum amount? - Five dollars. Oh, that much I happen to have on me. We have to wait. He went to the bank manager. Did something happen? These thieves don't want to pay out his cash. By what means? It's impossible. He's on the list of people leaving for permanent stay in Germany. Shit. He should've taken the money earlier. He couldn't carry so much money around. Earlier they hadn't said anything. They can pay it out in zloties by the state rates. The dollars must stay in the country. That's impossible. People take the dollars out of the country. They do, but probably they are not such emigrants as me. I don't know, what I could do. There must be some way out. I didn't know, there will be such complications. Wait, maybe something can still be done. How about the financial department? Financial department. He's eaten his lunch and now he's going for an ice-cream. Hope it doesn't upset his stomach. I can't do it anymore, Czesiek. We've got to work a little bit, Anka We're standing here so long. There are long lines in the offices. You can't get things done right away. But I'm also hungry. All right. Soon we'll make up for all this. Let me invite you for a lunch to Forum Hotel. You must be hungry. - Did you get it done? - I did. I'll take it in zlotys by the state rate and buy dollars at the black market. I'll take it in zlotys by the state rate and buy dollars at the black market. Zdzisiek, this is for the day you've wasted. Forget it Witek. So you didn't get anything arranged? Please, take it. I must somehow spend this change. Do you know, how much we lose? - I can't help it. - Listen. We can do, what this manager has told us. What? That you'll make a donation out of it. But I can't go to Germany without the money. These 5000 were for a good start. Only officially a donation. Then you can make an exchange. The cash for the donation money. You'll regain at least part of it. Holly shit. All day passed and he hasn't swallowed the hook. He's swallowed enough. Quite a big lunch. You need to inspire trust, somehow. I didn't think this money would go so fast. Almost everything I had. What would you expect? The lunch, now this hotel. Perhaps we should try with someone else? It's not enough for the second time. Good evening. - It's Zdzisiek speaking. - Good evening. Nice to hear you again. Listen, Witek. I've spoken to my family about your problems. I think that... we would be able to help you. But in what way? That's a lot of money. Perhaps, we don't look that, but we've got some buck stashed. I've been planning to buy a new car. Besides, I'm doing it for you. So what do you propose? Tomorrow we'll meet, you'll transfer your account to me. And take right away 3000 bucks. Okay with you? I don't know. I'm a little bit surprised. But it's better than the zloties. Besides, I'll take the tax payment on me. No, Zdzisiek... I'm afraid, I cannot accept that. - Do you have a better choice? - No, I don't. So, is it a deal? All right, it's a deal. Tomorrow at 9.00 am in the bank. Yes, at 9.00. Could I get a certificate, that I have a dollar account in your bank? - Who do you need it for? - For the Financial Department - and the lawyer. - Your ID, please. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. Let's check, if there are no mistakes. Mr Witold Srodecki... the donator... a resident of Cracow, has on his account in Pekao SA Bank in Warsaw the amount of 1 0.000 US dollars. Because of his emigration abroad, he transfers the above mentioned amount as a donation to Mr. Zdzislaw Mitura, the resident of Otwock, all the costs connected with the donation, the state fees and the taxes will be paid by the donation taker. Now, you have to sign this document. Congratulations, sir. It's a beautiful gesture. I didn't think that my last day here will look like this. - But at least, you were not bored. - That's true. Zdzisiek, I need one more favor from you. Fire it out. Tomorrow at 1 1 :00 I have a plane. I have nobody left here in Warsaw. I want somebody to bid farewell to me, to shake my hand for the last time. We'll come with the whole family, Witek. No need to worry. Thank you. All right. Here are the documents. The rest you'll manage yourself. This is your money. - Won't you count it? - Come on! That's the plane. Wave, children. Why waving? You saw, he wasn't there. - We must have missed each other. - He wasn't there. There must be a list of passengers. We'll check it. Now wave. He deceived me so much. The lawyer was false, the certificate was useless. What do you think, why did the defendant choose you as his victim? I don't know. I have never came across any swindles. Is it true that your father was hiding somebody during the German occupation? Well, my father wasn't... but my neighbor was. He's dead. Excuse me. Your ID, please. What are you doing in our town? I'm on vacation here. The man, who lives with you is your husband? No, he's not. Why isn't he registered? You'll have problems. He doesn't live here. He only visits me. Yes. Why does he visit you? Who is he for you? He is... He's a diplomat. A diplomat. So how is it? Are you on vacation here, or working? You have no right! You won't achieve much with these diplomats. And your ID? We've got enough sluts here. We don't need the visiting ones. Czesiek. - Czesiek, wake up. - What? - What's up? - Some undercover policeman stopped me. He was asking me, who you are. What did you tell him? You can't live here without registration. We must leave. - But what did you tell him? - That you're a diplomat. He took me for a slut. Don't worry. What did you tell him? That you're a diplomat. THE CONSULATE OF THE AUSTRIAN REPUBLIC - Good morning. - Morning. I'd like to ask you a favor, sir. I'm an employee of the Austrian Consulate. I have some forms, which need to be printed. These are the samples. Don't involve me in the politics, man. What politics? Company paper and the business cards. I was at your manager, who told me I can have it done in a month. But I need them for yesterday. I can't have it ready even till the day after tomorrow. And how about today? For today, neither. So, for yesterday. You're saying, for yesterday. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - How can I help you, sir. - I'd like to order few stamps. Here is the order. It's a company paper, but... there are no stamps here. If I had them, I wouldn't come to you. You'll make them, we'll stamp the paper and everything will be all right. Sir... I can't do such things. It's a pity. - I thought you'll do it unofficially. - Just a moment. - Are you insane? - The type-writer. Here. The German language handbooks. The dictionaries. The company paper. Business cards. Four types of stamps. A round one and three rectangles. These cards are mine. And the smaller ones... Where are they? They are yours. - You weren't to start anything. - If something's wrong, we're gone. And I hoped, that you'll change. Cool down. You don't risk anything. Do you know, how your German sounds? You speak like an illegal immigrant and not a diplomat. I don't have to be speaking German. It's even better, when an Austrian speaks Polish. What do you need it for? I saw such a man once on the road. He seemed to me like from a different world. It will be tight. You'll go back, where you came from. It won't be a regular number. May I go with you? We haven't ordered it. What's going on? This man ordered it for you. Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen. I would like to propose a toast. To the Vienna Victory and the Austrian-Polish friendship. Complete nutcase. Me? You said, I'm a diplomat. I'm checking, if they'll buy it. Excuse me. My name is Linder. I'd the reporter for ''The Evening''. It's a local afternoon newspaper. Yes? I'd like to write a note about this friendly gesture and to thank for the champagne. Take a seat, please. Thank you. Will you tell our readers, who you are? It's not a secret. Dr. engineer Jacek Ben Silberstein, the Austrian Consul in your town. But there isn't an Austrian Consulate in our town. But there is a need for it. We're opening a diplomatic post here. After you, Mr. Consul. Yes, thank you. Mr. Consul will be an Ambassador, soon, Mr. Consul will be an Ambassador, soon, and it won't be appropriate if he takes off his pants. You dirty pig. When shall we leave this place, Mr. Diplomat? The game is just starting. Consul is untouchable. Czesiek. That must be police. Don't open the door. They came for the authentication letters. Tell them, I'll bring them to Belvedere myself. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Is Mr. Consul here? - Who? Mr. Consul. He was at the restaurant, speaking to Mr. Winder and buying champagne to everybody. Yes, please, come in. Thank you. I've heard what you were saying about the Consulate. Perhaps, there could be some job for me there? You're asking for work. Do you speak German? Me? No. But I learn very fast. - What schools have you completed? - I have higher education. - Really? - I studied for 2 years. Economics. Well, sir... Do you have money for deposit? I don't understand. You need to pay deposit if you want to pay for us. How much? 50.000 zloty. - Do you have that much? - Yes, I do. All right, then. Don't count for anything, but come and ask on... Montag. Monday! Monday. Thank you. I'll come for sure. Good bye. Bye. Please... Everything is like you wanted. The taxi sign is off, the number painted over. I've spent half the night doing that. Till the Consulate is open you work on credit. With pleasure. - To the Provincial Governor. - Yes, sir. - Good morning. - Good morning. Dr. Silberstein is the Austrian Consul in Poland. He'd like to see the Provincial Governor. Did you have an appointment? No, I'm afraid. Mr. Consul is passing by the town. Of course, we'll have a lot of problems with that. And that's the case for you, Mr. Janek. - Here. - Good. Mr. Governor, the Austrian Consul is here. - He's waiting at the front desk. - The Austrian Consul? Dr. Engineer Jacek Ben Silberstein. Mr. Stefan, as far as I know, you know German well. I know it, so so. The Austrian Consul is here, someone needs to speak to him. Janek was on a business trip to East Germany. He's got experience. What experience? I've been only once. With the interpreter. He also has an interpreter. You could have said it right away. Jan Gus, the director of the Organizational-Legal Department. Jacek Ben Silberstein, General Consulate of Austria. My attache. Welcome. My interpreter. It's a pleasure. Please, take seats. Perhaps you will translate, so there are no misunderstandings. It's not an official visit. I understand a little bit. I can speak Polish. You're managing quite well. How can I help you? We've been sent here by Warsaw... - By the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. - Oh, yes. Yes. We're opening the Austrian Consulate in your town and we need some help with organizing things, so that... The place, for that matter and other things. Excuse me for a moment. I'll see if Mr. Governor is already available. As usual, we are the last ones to be informed. Somebody in the Ministry must have bungled it. Linder was asking me about this Consulate. - Who? - ''The Evening's'' reporter. There was some party at the Monopol. Proposing toasts or something... The others get to the parties and we must just do the work. Where will I get the place for him? How about sending him back to Warsaw? To Berger? Quite a good idea. We have a lot of good will but we cannot take any decision without the consent of the Consular Department from the Council of Ministers Office. Please, give him the number. This is the secretary of the Austrian Consul in Poland speaking. Could I speak with the director of the Consular Department? - Yes, Berger. - It's Jacek Ben Silberstein speaking. The Austrian Consul in Poland. I'm pleased to hear you. How can I help you? Mr. Director, The Republic of Austria is opening a new diplomatic post here. - The Consulate. - Yes, I've been informed about it. We have a small problem. Some difficulties. In cooperation with the Provincial Council. - I guess, we should meet. - Of course, naturally. Just tell me the date and the place. How about my office at the Council of Ministers? Let's say... On Thursday, the 8th. Just a moment, I have to check. I can come at 2:00 p. m. Will you be in any company, or by yourself? I'll be there, my interpreter... And attache. Two of them. Master of Arts, Jerzy Berger, the director of the Consular Department. Dr. Jacek Ben Silberstein, the General Consul of Austria. Welcome. Krzysztof Jankowski, Investment Attache. Roman Bialas, Economical Attache. Mrs. Anna Kowalski, the interpreter. Pleased to meet you. Please, take the seats. I'm sorry. Mr. Andrzej Lentz, our interpreter. We have two interpreters, so we can speak Polish. Of course, this will be easier. I admire your knowledge of Polish. But how about your co-workers? All of them speak Polish. They are a well matched team. So how can I help you, Mr. Consul? So the most important thing is the place. Just a little house. For the Consulate. We also want to buy some furniture, carpets and stuff like that. I understand. All the money must be absolutely spent by the end of this year. Otherwise, it's gone. My attache will explain it best. We know it. We have the same problems. So how can I help you? Mr. Director. It's about the local authorities. It's not good. I've been to the Provincial Governor. You know about it. I'm very happy that you've found time to visit us again. Please, come in. Please. Take your seats. We haven't received the documents from the Ministry, but it's not a problem. With the approval of the Council of Ministers we've taken some steps. At the nearest meeting the executive committee will decide about transferring the building. For the Consulate. For the time of renovation we're offering you an apartment and three rooms in the Monopol Hotel. There will be also stores assigned, in which the Consulate will be purchasing goods out of turn. - Just ordering things. - Wonderful. Good organization. Gentlemen, I'd like to do something for the town. Could you propose something? It's hard to say at once. We have so many needs. Exactly. How about a monument? Oh, that's a great idea. We'll find some occasion. But first, we'd like to invite you to take part in the manifestation. It would be a significant gesture on the part of the Austrian authorities. - Look, Zdzisiek. - What is it? Just look. ''Flowers from the Austrian Consul. '' Look at the picture. I'll kill the sucker. Please, come in. I hope, you will be satisfied. Yes, that's good. If you allow, Mr. Consul, I'd like to introduce to you... The Captain is here to care for the safety of our guests. The Captain has taken care of us once. Please, take my apologies. Please, forgive me. It's the result of my work. Here, this is the key, Mr. Consul. From now on, please, feel like at home. When shall we set the date of payment? That'll be later. We won't be so rigid. One more thing. Are you planning any reception? - Excuse me? - A party. I'm asking because the room has to be booked earlier for that. Yes, of course. We'll organize a reception here. The Ambassador and honorary guests will be here. I can imagine, what will be going on here. That's good. Good. Hello. Good afternoon. Please, follow me. Please, see, how the guests will be seated. The Ambassador to the right of the Party Secretary? - Yes. - Rather, the Secretary - to the right of the Ambassador. - As you wish, sir. - I'll be next to you, Mr. Consul. - Good. And me? Please, have a look, Mr. Consul. The girls will give flowers to the Ambassador. I hope, they look good, don't they? This blonde girl is quite good. Excuse me. I'll check, what it is about. Don't open it, please! This may be some provocation. Please, call the captain. Oh, yes, of course. Captain! Open up, please! I'm here. What can I do? Do you see this man? That is Wisniak! - Is he your man? - He stole my money! He's a little bit... He's mistaken me for somebody else. - It's not necessary here. - Yes, sir. - Seven, do you hear me? - Seven, reporting. By the restaurant door some fatso is looking for trouble. Remove him. This is Wisniak. He's not a diplomat. Let me go! That's a criminal! A criminal! Excuse us for this incident. Well, it happens. We have such incidents, too. Good job, Captain. - No problem. - Thank you. Excuse me. Mr. Consul, we've got inquirers. Excuse me. The work won't wait. See you at the opening. Make sure you see to everything. Here. Your visas, please. Check the room decoration and I'll take care of them. Of course. One moment, please. - How do I look? - Wonderful. But, I'm afraid, you won't have a chance to dance. - Why? - There are two Austrians behind the door. - We've got to beat it. - Now? - There was supposed to be a party. - Your husband was downstairs. Sooner or later, he'll be back. Jesus Christ, I can't go like this. Anka, we really don't have time. Good evening. Please, welcome and come in. Good evening. Mr. Governor, I'd like to welcome you on behalf of Mr. Consul. Hello. Please, come in. Good evening. And where is the host? Mr. Consul asked me to apologize. He went to meet the Ambassador. They should be here any moment now. Everything is ready, of course. Please, be so kind to have a look at this. Please, stop the car for a moment. Yes, sir. We won't stand like this. Please, come in for an aperitif. Ladies and Gentlemen, please, come in for aperitifs. We can wait somewhere. We've got money. - We can settle somehow. - No chance. After this scandal, we'll be busted, sooner or later. What are you talking about? I'm thinking about you. For me prison is more real than this whole life here. Wait. You have these passports. - You want to leave the country? - We should've done it long ago. We have no chance here. In Austria neither. They already have a chancellor. Gentlemen... do something. How long can we wait? Mr. Governor, please, stay calm. They should be here any moment. You understand, that this is an awkward situation? I do apologize, but everything will be all right. They should be here any moment. I've had a call from the Police Headquarters. This Consulate is a fiction. There were some protests from the Austrian Embassy. I don't understand. They asked, whose idea this Consulate was. They are asking us? - There was an order from Warsaw. - That's a provocation! He's not a Consul, but a fraud. The police are looking for him. - It's a coup. - Yes, a provocation. I do protest! Where's Anka! Tell me! - Not here. - Are you nuts?! - You're under arrest. - Me? Yes, follow me. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. The Austrian government gave up on opening the Consulate in our town. What's going on Czesiek? A moment longer and it will be too late. Be calm. What is it, Czesiek? Something's going on behind us. You got in the car on the way. Run away now. - Czesiek. - Run away. Witness Jan Gus. He couldn't come due to urgent business matters. He gave his testimony in the preparatory proceedings. Witness Jerzy Berger. Witness Jerzy Berger. Your Honor. Oh, yes, indeed. I'm sorry, the witness gave his testimony in the the preparatory proceedings. Your Honor. I said everything voluntarily. And I agree with the opinion of the Prosecutor. I can't agree with the charge that I wanted to cross the border illegally using a stolen passport. When... we were driving towards the border, I felt strong regret. I understood, that there isn't a second such place in the world. Your Honor. I wouldn't be able to leave the country. I would like to apply for a lenient punishment. So, you're back, Wisniak. I'm back. 595 and 623kk What is it? What can it be? Political prisoner. Translation and subtitles: Agata Deka
