I'm good with that take if you guys are? - I'm good. - Okay good, we gotta make this quick release before Christmas. - Cutting it close this time huh? - Too close. - What can I say? Last minute inspiration. What'd you think, Harm? - Just one small thing. - Actually, you know what? You mind going and getting me some tea? - Tyler can grab that for you. - No that's alright, she doesn't mind. And she knows exactly how I like it. Thank you babe! Look I'm gonna try that bridge one more time. Wow. - They're doing another take, said they'll open the door when it's clear. - Gotcha. - I think there's some chairs in the back. - Thanks. ♪ Snow is falling, ♪ ♪ we don't notice ♪ ♪ You're the warmth ♪ ♪ of winter bliss ♪ ♪ Make this moment ♪ ♪ last forever ♪ ♪ Be the greatest ♪ ♪ Christmas gift ♪ ♪ You're my Christmas ♪ ♪ wish come true ♪ ♪ Hope alive when I'm with you ♪ ♪ Before the night is through ♪ ♪ Open up my heart ♪ ♪ I do ♪ - Harmony! What are you doing? - I was just playing with the lyrics a little bit. - We already laid down the chorus, and I'm happy with where it's at. When I ask for a tea I expect to get it before the end of the session. - You were in the middle of a take. - And it was terrible because you were in here instead of getting me the cup of tea. Thank you baby. - Did you write that? - What? Oh yeah, I did. - It's good, and you're quite a beautiful performer too. - Trust me I'm not. That's all Devin, I just occasionally write songs, and Devin makes 'em sound good. - Devin is Devin. But it doesn't seem like you need him to make it sound good. I didn't realize that we were recording a song that you wrote today. - Trust me Devin is the star here. - One that didn't apparently get there by himself. There's room for more than one star in the sky. Look I like what I just heard. - You're very sweet, thank you. That means a lot coming from you. Should we get back in there? - You do too much for him you know? - I'm sorry? - Yeah, I thought that even before I knew that you were the one behind the music too. I see it all the time, these guys taste a little bit of success, and completely forget how they got there. - Devin's not like that, don't worry. Truth is, he was there for me at a time that I didn't have anyone else. So it's my turn to be there for him. - There's a difference between being there for someone and letting someone use you. Be careful, okay? It seems like you're giving more in this relationship than you're getting back. - Babe, earlier in the studio when you went off and started playing your own version of the song, you gotta run that stuff by me first. - I'm sorry what? - You can't just go off and play that stuff where everyone can here you. It's my song. Besides I thought I made it very clear that if there was anything that you wanted to change you would come and talk to me? - I tried to, you wouldn't listen. - When? - Right before. - That's what I'm talking about Harmony, you can't be interrupting me while I'm in the middle of recording. - It's my song. - Really? Well then why am I the one in the studio? Besides whatever you were trying to play was totally off. - I thought it could be better. - It wasn't. Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but. - But what? You don't want anyone to know who's behind you're music? - You know you're not listening right now Harmony. You wanna be on my team then it's gotta be Devin first. You know this. I'm just trying to help you out. - Are you? Devin I don't know what you're getting so upset about. It was half a song and no one even heard it but you. I'm on your team 100%. - Thank you. Please don't put those up babe, they ruin the whole aesthetic of the place. - I like them! They're festive. - They're ugly! But you, you are beautiful. Come here. Sorry, just. Kevin! So sorry. Yeah I got a minute. - I'm telling you, Jules, he was obsessing over nothing. I felt like a kid in the principal's office. - You guys are probably just distracted, because with the holidays coming up and don't you leave for the tour tomorrow too? - Yep, at 11:00 a.m., I'm packing right now. - I am so glad that I have my Christmas decorating to do to keep me distracted from packing. I can't believe that I am gonna be freezing cold in Milwaukee with my crazy sister and sugar-fueled nephews. While you are just living it up in Los Angeles with VIP the treatment. - Living it up? - Oh my God, what if he proposes to you while you're out there? - What? Where did you get that, I just told you how off we've been. - Okay, maybe that's why he's been so distracted because he's gonna surprise you, oh for Christmas. Oh it is so romantic. My best friend engaged to a superstar! I hope you know that I want to be you when I grow up. - Jules you're ridiculous, don't get ahead of yourself. - I'm just saying that it's possible. - Sure. - Well that sounded convincing, what's up? - Nothing. - Also convincing. - Seriously, I don't know I just I feel like things were different between Devin and I before. Like easier, closer. - Obviously, that was a long time ago. He was just a broke kid, and you were the only one supporting his dreams. You do know that you practically made him right? - I just, miss the old Devin sometimes. - Well the new Devin is hot, and he is famous. And every girl would do practically anything - Yeah I know, I'm very lucky. Hey Jules my dad is calling. Can I give you a call you back? - Wow, you're actually gonna talk to him? Or are you just trying to get rid of me? - I'll call you back, Jules, start packing! - Yeah, yeah, later. You are coming with me tree. Oh. - Hiya dad. - Hey, you actually answered your phone. - I know I'm sorry, I've been meaning to call you back I've just been so busy. - It's alright, it's good to hear your voice now. I'm just calling to check and see if you got the flights we sent. I haven't, but I told you, Devin and I leave for tour tomorrow, so I'm not gonna be able to make it. - Oh I thought for Christmas you'd get some time off? - Nope, Devin has a show in LA on Christmas Eve. - And you have to be there? - Dad. - Okay, okay, we just miss ya that's all. - We? - Debbie and I. - Dad, I don't even know Debbie. - Well maybe it'd be nice if you did? - I have to go, I have a lot to do before tomorrow. - Okay, okay, I won't keep you any longer. I love you. - Love you too, talk soon, bye. - Bye bye. Here we go. Hey. - Hey. - They were out of sesame, so I got you everything instead. What what's wrong? - We need to talk. - What a jerk. - How could he do this? I don't know what to do. - Did he give you any reason? - He said that with everything going on that he doesn't have time to commit to a relationship. And he doesn't want to keep stringing me along. - Right. - I mean I know things weren't perfect but I didn't expect this! - Well maybe this is a good thing. I never really liked him anyway. - What are you talking about? You were the one who just said how perfect he is! And how he was gonna propose on Christmas! - Well that was yesterday, and today, today you can do much, much better. - We've been planning this holiday tour for months Jules. What am I supposed to do? - Well, I would invite you to come to Milwaukee with me but I don't wanna make you feel worse. - That's okay, I appreciate the offer. - What if you went home? - No, I don't want anything to do with that apartment anymore. - No, I mean home home, to Miracle. - That's not home, that hasn't been home since mom died. - Well, you're dad's still there, and that house that looks so beautiful at Christmas time. I mean it could be perfect timing, you were just saying how much you missed your dad. - Yeah I do, but I don't wanna go to Miracle. No one ever leaves or does anything with their life. It's like the Twilight Zone did an episode on a Kincaid painting. - Okay I love you Harm, but you're being just a little dramatic. - It's true! - No it's not, you left. - I was lucky, the only reason to visit before was because of family, and now that my mom's gone I see no reason to subject myself to that howdy doody. - What? I couldn't even, what are you saying? Okay, I think that you should just go. Because then you'll go and you will feel so much better and you will just see how far you've come, and you won't even have to think about stupid what's his face. - I still have his stuff. - Consider it taken care of. Let's have some more ice cream okay? - Great, okay. - Harmony? - Wonderful! I don't even know what I'm looking at. Ow! Ow. Nice one Harmony. Ow. No. No! No! No! - You don't need to shave. - Yes, I definitely do. Look there's hair right here. You're not looking. - Nothing to see. - Then you're just in denial about my manhood. - Not at all. - Come on then look, you see it? - No. - It's right over here, watch out! ♪ Scrooge on a winter's night ♪ ♪ The only catch is that ♪ - I'm really sorry about that, seems like you were already having a bad day. - It's okay. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come along. - Stayed dry. - Weston. - Maybe, but I would've been stranded. Thank you for the ride. - His name's Luke. - Luke, nice to meet you. And you are Weston? - Correct. - Hi. I'm Harmony. - Nice to meet you. - So what brings you into town Harmony? - Just visiting my dad. - What happened to your car? - I don't really know. - There's a gal, Becky back in town, she'll be able to fix that for you. - Yeah she has a tow truck too. - Yes she does. - Thanks. - I don't think I've seen you around here before. Is this your first time in Miracle for Christmas? - No. But it's been awhile since I've been back, and I'm not staying for Christmas. - You're not? It's what like a week away? I figured that's why you came here to visit. - Miracle's the best place in the world for Christmas, everybody comes to town for it. - He's right, seems a waste to visit so close to it and miss the main event. - We'll see, and at this point I'm just wondering where the next minute will take me. - That was Long December by Let's Be Friends. Now here's the new release by Devin Cruise, Christmas Wish. - So what's your dad's? - Are you kidding me? ♪ The gifts are open ♪ ♪ Bags are packed ♪ ♪ I'm headed home and ♪ - Why are all of these the same? ♪ Everybody's had a good time ♪ - How do you turn this off? - What are you do? ♪ On my mind ♪ ♪ You're the gift ♪ ♪ that keeps on giving ♪ - What was that about? - Nothing, sorry, I just, I hate music.

You could use a new wardrobe. - Harmony! - Pam, oh my gosh, hi. - I haven't seen you in forever. I haven't seen you since your mom's. We were all really worried about you after the service you just disappeared. I tried calling but I figured you had a lot going on. - Congratulations, when are you expecting? - Thank you, February 9th, baby number two. - Wow, two babies. - I know. - Oh my gosh. - Yeah, you've missed a bit while you've been out there conquering the world. How are things going with Devin? - They're good, yeah, they're great. Listen I gotta run, but it's great seeing you. - How long are you in town for? It would be great to get the girls together for a little reunion. - I would love to, unfortunately I'm leaving tomorrow. Or the next day, whenever my car gets fixed. - Aren't you a tumbleweed? Okay, well, how about you let me know next time you're planning on coming back and I'll be sure to set something up ahead of time. - For sure, yeah, it was great seeing you Pam. - You too. Morning. - Good morning, large coffee please. - Paint me green and call me a pickle. Is that Harmony? - Shirley. - Girl you are all grown up! - It's good to see you how have you been? - I was great until this morning you remember Herman? Of course you remember Herman, he and your mother always tickling those ivories together. Man, I miss those gatherings. Well anyway, Herman decided to inform me right in the middle of my scrambled eggs and toast no less that he is moving to Bora Bora in four days, four days! So he can no longer direct the Christmas Music Festival, which is something he has been doing for 17 years. - Bora Bora, wow. - Yeah supposedly it was his wife Mary that talked him into it, isn't that the absolute worst news you've ever heard? - Sure, yeah, I'm so sorry to hear that. - Why he thinks he can leave us high and dry on the single most important event of the year is absolutely beyond me! - Miss, that'll be $2. - Oh, sorry. Thank you. - Have a great day. - Not likely with this Herman business! So now I have to look for a replacement for him. I don't know how I'm supposed to pull this off. I'm mean I'm already busier than a one-legged cat in a sandbox. But there's no one else to do it except, so well, please give your father a hug for me. And if you can if you think of anybody to save our Christmas show. Harmony, Harmony's back in town. - And now it's snowing, of course. I'm gonna get him back. - You wanna do what? - Yeah, no I think it's gonna work Jules. I'm gonna show up in LA, surprise him at his concert, and he's gonna realize this was all just one big mistake. - I don't know if that's the best idea, Harm. - I've been here less than a day and I already feel like I need to leave. I don't fit in here. - While that totally is fair, that doesn't mean that you need to go to Los Angeles and try and win back the jerk who basically called you excess baggage. - Maybe it does. - What about that guy who gave you a ride the other day, Jake? - Oh Luke? - Yeah he sounded like a stud. - I'm not interested, plus I'm pretty sure he's taken, he has a kid. - He does? You didn't say that before. - It's Miracle, Jules, everybody has kids. They marry their high school sweethearts and move into little blue cottages and have white picket fences. - Thank goodness that you escaped that nightmare huh? - Yeah thank goodness. - Listen, okay, I hear you on the whole, not wanting to live in your hometown, but that does not mean that you need to get Devin back. - He was my whole life, you take him away, and there's nothing left. - Is that what you really want? - It's all I have, that's why I am going to get him back on Christmas, I just need my car to get fixed and then I'm out of here. ♪ No more broken promises ♪ ♪ No more empty hymns ♪ ♪ For pilgrims ♪ ♪ seeking sanctuary ♪ ♪ Love's where it begins ♪ ♪ For pilgrims ♪ ♪ seeking sanctuary ♪ ♪ Love is where it is ♪ ♪ Love is found within ♪ - Harmony. - Sorry that was beautiful, I didn't. - No that was perfect I like that a lot better. - No, it was great before I. - I thought you hated music? - Yeah, that wasn't entirely accurate. - Yeah, I figured as much.

You two are a blessing from above. The Christmas Music Festival is saved! - What? - You two must music direct the festival. - Shirley, I can't do that. - Well that's why Harmony will help you. I can't believe I didn't think of it before. Of course you would follow in your mom's footsteps. I was coming here to beg Luke. Herman told me that you were babysitting the shop today. But with the two of you it would be perfect. - No, really Shirley, I'm not gonna be here for Christmas. - Nonsense you have to stay, Miracle is the best place in the world at Christmas. - No I have to go and. - And? - I have to be in LA for Christmas eve. - LA? That's even worse than Herman going off to Bora boring. - Everything okay? - I'm not sure. - My you're quite the popular one, but it's fine I'll wait. - Sorry, let me just figure out what's going on. - Harmony, you know that the Christmas Festival is the most important part of our holiday tradition in Miracle, and if you. - Shirley, I think Harmony made it clear that she won't be here. - But. - No buts! - But. - I changed my mind. I think I'd like to stay. - Wonderful. - What? - Yeah, I think I'd like to stay here for Christmas. - Oh that's perfect, oh I'll be in touch with you later about all the details. Thank you for saving the festival. And now I gotta get busy planning Herman's If you knew what he put me through, but I'm still giving him the best bon voyage party that Miracle, no, ooh, the world has ever seen! - What just happened? - I'm staying for Christmas and we're directing the Christmas Festival. - Oh. Morning. - Well there you are. Sounds like an eventful morning, from what I hear. Understand you're gonna be directing the Miracle Christmas Festival. - How on earth did you hear that? - Word travels fast in a small town, made you an omelet. - Thank you. - Especially when you're talking about the Christmas Festival. - Mm mm mm, something smells delicious. Harmony, it's so good to see you. - You too Debbie. - Oh thank you darling, so you're doing the festival? - With Luke. - Apparently so, you know him? - Yeah he's a bit of a town star, if you know what I mean. - Please don't say that, I've had my fill of stars lately. - Well not like that honey, what Debbie means is he's respected. - A hero really, because of Weston and all. - Having a kid makes you a town hero? - Well in Luke's case it kinda does. - A little bit. - Can we go ice skating at the pond today? - I thought you hated ice skating? - I kind of do. But I have to do an assignment for Mrs. Brown's class. - Mrs. Brown told you you need to go ice skating? - No, not really, but I don't know what else to do. - Let me see that. Christmas is about more than just time off from school and presents from Santa, but what does it mean to you? Make your own version of the 12 Days of Christmas with your own list of 12 things that matter most to you this Christmas. Like ice skating? - I don't know, that's what Kyle said he was doing, Sean too. - Listen if you want to go ice skating we can we can go ice skating. But I think your teacher wants you to pick something that's a little more meaningful. And unless you have some secret life that I don't know about, I'm sure we can find at least a dozens of things that would rate better than that in your book. - Yeah this is why I hate homework. - Yeah. We'll figure out something good. Hey you! - Hi. - Come on in. Let me get that for ya. - Thank you. - You're welcome, I see Becky finished your car. - She did, and she was every bit as brilliant as you said she'd be. - Yeah she something, after you. - Wow, you have a beautiful home. - Thanks, and it's a work in progress. - I don't know what you're talking about, I think it's beautiful. - You remember Weston. - I do, hi Weston. - Hi. - Something wrong? - Oh he's just moody over a school project that he has to do. - I see, what's the project? Wow, Mrs. Brown. Wait I remember this, I had to do this when I was your age. I can't believe she's still teaching. - Yeah she's ancient. - That's what I thought at your age too. I can help you if you want? - Yeah, do you want to give me yours? - I don't know about that, but I'd be happy to help you make your own. - I guess that's fine. - Weston! - What? - Say thank you. - For what? We haven't done anything yet. - Kid's got a point. - I'm trying to set a good example here. - You are. - Shall we get started? - Yes. Okay so Shirley assures me that there are plenty of people excited to perform, so that makes me feel better. - Yeah me too. - No, you should definitely be up there with your guitar. - No, no, no, no, no, I am happy to help out in any way that I can, but I have no desire to be up on that stage. Music for me is more, personal. It's my therapy in a way, and I don't feel right being in the spotlight, does any of that make sense? - It makes all the sense in the world. - It's Shirley, sorry one second. Hello. Hey. - So, do you have any ideas for the project? - Not really, I asked Luke about going ice skating but he thinks we can do better. Why do we have homework over Christmas break? It's entirely unfair. - Well I agree. But I bet we can figure out something really good. - That's exactly what Luke said. - Alright, so, apparently one of the pipes in Shirley's house broke and everything is flooding. - Yikes, wait she called you about that? - He's the guy everyone calls, he's basically the town handyman. - I hate to do this but can we reschedule? - Of course. - Thank you. Weston get your coat. - No, I don't wanna go. - Come on hurry up. - Why can't I just stay here. - You know I can't leave you by yourself. - I'm not by myself. - Weston. - I can stay with him. - I can't ask you to do that. - You didn't I offered, it's really not a problem, we can get a start on Mrs. Brown's project. - Alright if you don't mind. - I really don't. - Thank you. There's lasagna and a half a roast chicken here in the fridge, along with there's plenty of roast veggies that you can just heat up. Mi casa es Su casa - Awesome. - Great. Oh first aid kit, right here in the cabinet. Let me take it out, just so you know where it is. - We're fine, go. Is he always like this? - Always. - Let me give you my phone number just so you have it. - I have it, you gave me your address remember? - Right, right, let me give you the number to the town sheriff. - Seriously, go, help Shirley, her house is flooding as we speak. - Good point. Okay. Okay, thank you. - Wow I cannot believe that worked. - What do you mean? - Luke's uptight, he doesn't really trust anyone. This means he trusts you. - Do you always call him Luke? - What else would I call him? - Dad? - Oh, Luke's not my dad. - He's not? - He's my uncle, my dad died awhile ago. - I'm so sorry. - It's cool, he's a good uncle, but he's definitely in denial about my manhood. - What? - You heard me, he thinks of me as this little kid he has to take care of constantly. You saw it just now, but honestly, I'm the one taking care of him. True story. - I see, well he's very lucky to have you. - We're lucky to have each other. - Alright, what do you say we start tackling this project? - Sure. - Hello? Weston! What's this? - What do you think? Just working on some stuff for the project. - Where's Harmony? - She's here, she's getting some construction paper. I told her where it was. - Aha! - What are you doing? - Oh hey you're back. - What are you doing with this? - Oh I was just trying to get some paper. - Oh, yeah there's no paper in here. - No I know it was underneath. - Listen thank you so much for watching Weston but I got it from here, I'll walk you out. - Okay. - Goodnight. - And that's when I told him we had better do whatever it takes to find that doll before Christmas. - That just made me very afraid of when Emily starts asking for specific dolls. - As you should be! Treasure these early years while you can. - Are you bringing her to Herman's big send-off on Friday? - Oh yes, We found her the cutest Christmas sweater and everything. - Leave it to Shirley to make a Bora Bora sendoff party Christmas sweater themed. - I can't believe Herman is leaving. I've missed so much. - Well you know, that's life. You had your own dreams, but we are thrilled you're here now, we haven't had a proper girls' night in I can't even tell you how long. - You know what though? I'm realizing, I don't think that they were my dreams. I mean I gave so much of myself to Devin, and for what? - Forget him, if he doesn't know how special you are he doesn't deserve you. - Seriously. - And on that note, I hear you've been spending a little time with the town stud. - Okay, I have heard town star, town hero, and now the town stud? - Luke is all of those things. - Well great, I've upset the town star, hero, stud then. - Upset him what? - Yeah I don't even really know what happened? - Well? - Well what? - Well what did you do? - I was helping Weston with a project while Luke was out I don't know helping Shir. - What do you mean out? - He left you alone with Weston? - Yeah, is that a big deal? - Go on tell us the rest. - Okay. So I went upstairs to find some paper and then Luke got home and saw me holding this box by the hall closet and got all weird, and he kinda kicked me out. - Wait that's it? He saw you holding some box by the closet? - That's it. - Oh! Okay, I think I know what's going on here. Get your coats let's go. - Harmony. - Hi. - Hey. - Shh. - What are you doing here? - I don't actually really know. - What is she doing? - Shh, shh. - I'm sorry about earlier. You didn't do anything wrong, I just. - Ooh! - Oh, hey guys, how are you? - Hi! Hello it's so good to see you. Harmony, I didn't know you'd be here. We were just out for a little stroll in the area. All together, by the way, really like what you've done with those hedges. - It's beautiful. - Oh look, here's where I left my car. - Wait, guys. - Stay warm, bye bye. - Guys! - What was that about? - I think we all just turned 13 again. Must be something in the air. - Yeah I don't follow. - It's a girl thing. I think I should get going too. - Didn't your ride just leave you? - Yes, yes she did. - I can give you a ride. - No, no, you know what, I think I'll just walk. It's nice out. - I'll walk you home then. - No, you have Weston, please. - What I can't walk a beautiful woman home? - I didn't mean that. - Actually Weston is with his friend Kyle tonight. Let me get my coat. - Okay. - After you. When did you move away? - Gosh, 10 years ago, it's been awhile. I used to visit pretty often, but then my mom passed away. It's just been kinda hard to come back. It doesn't feel like home without her. - I'm sorry. - You know I realized though, that it hasn't been fair to my dad. I know I've neglected him. He started dating Debbie and I couldn't handle it. Not that there's anything wrong with Debbie, she's actually really lovely I just, miss my mom. When did you move to Miracle? Tell me about you, yeah. - Me, God about five years ago now. - That's right when I stopped visiting. - Really? - Yeah. - Shame. - What brought you here? - Well I think you already know part of this. And that is that Weston isn't my son. I mean, he's legally mine, but I'm not his real dad. - Yeah, Weston did mention that. - Yeah, yeah, he was my brother's kid. And when he was born, his mom, well she took off. Ad my brother when he passed, I became his legal guardian, per David's wishes. And mine of course. And hopefully Weston's. - Weston told me that he feels very lucky to have you. - No, I'm the lucky one. He's a good kid. And David, David was a great dad. David was a great guy, and I know I fall short of that everyday. - I can assure you that is not true. I see what you do for Weston and for this town and I can't even begin to explain how in awe of you I am. - Hey where'd you go? Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah. So I've been so upset about this guy that I knew was I guess I thought was the one. But I don't know, I look at you and the way that you love Weston, and my dad and Debbie. And the girls and how happy they are. And I realize I never had that. I thought that I had to get away from this town to be happy, and to figure things out. And I've done neither of those things by being away from Miracle. In fact all I've really done is neglect the people that I love. Wow I'm sorry, that was a lot. - I know I don't know you that well, but I'd say you've got the really important parts, very much figured out. Weston doesn't just take to anybody the way that he takes to you. And he's a very good judge of character. - Weston seems like an extraordinary young man. - You see it too don't you? - Yeah, who wouldn't? - My ex-fiance and I were together for about six years before my brother got sick. And in the being she was great. She was patient and understanding. I mean I had uprooted our lives to come here and take care of him until he got better. And then he passed away. And she changed. I mean she couldn't understand why I would wanna be Weston's guardian, she just saw him as this kid that was getting in the way of her life plans. And ultimately she gave me a choice, and I chose Weston. And she chose this prat banker. And fell in love with his jet, or at least I tell myself she fell in love with his jet. - Luke I am so sorry. - It's okay, we wanted two different things in life. And we would have never discovered that if none of this happened. It doesn't mean I wasn't very much in love with her at one time. - Well that whole town hero thing makes a lot more sense now. - Town hero? - Yeah it's just something I heard. You're a good man, Luke. And everyone can see it. Is this where we're gonna be tomorrow? - I believe so. - Wow, quite the setup. Are you ready for this adventure, Luke? - Not in the slightest. - Well then should we try a test run before we have to teach everyone tomorrow? - Sure. - Actually this is something that I was writing earlier, when I was thinking, you'll see. Let's see if we can do anything with them. - These are beautiful. - They're a work in progress, but. - Let's try it. - Okay. ♪ Hello again snow ♪ ♪ Has it been so long ♪ ♪ Swept back to old homes ♪ ♪ Awake until dawn ♪ ♪ Sweet winter reverie ♪ ♪ Still in my thoughts ♪ ♪ Bright tree-lit ♪ ♪ memories all mine ♪ ♪ Sing timeless angels ♪ ♪ Echo in snow ♪ ♪ Hearts know it's ♪ ♪ never goodbye ♪ ♪ Though time doesn't wait ♪ ♪ The world spinning on ♪ ♪ In winter, you wake ♪ ♪ What's lost is not gone ♪ ♪ Sweet winter reverie ♪ ♪ Still in my thoughts ♪ ♪ Bright tree-lit ♪ ♪ memories all mine ♪ ♪ Sing timeless angels ♪ ♪ Echo in snow ♪ ♪ Hearts know it's ♪ ♪ never goodbye ♪ - Henry! - Hey Herman. - Debbie. - How ya doing big guy? - Oh wonderful now.

We're all set up for it. I know you guys can do it, so if Herman's band doesn't get here in the next 30 minutes, I am gonna introduce you. So why don't you go tune up or whatever it is you do. - No, Shirley we can't do that. I can play for the festival singers if you want? I just saw Kristen. - Nonsense, I hear you two rehearsing every day, and we have to save the festival performance for the festival. Oh no could you hold on a minute, I see a wayward elf about to serve the cheese quiche to Daniel, and we all know he's lactose intolerant. Daniel put down the quiche. - How does this keep happening? - It'll be fine. I'm sure the band will show up. I can't believe the band didn't show up. - Are we really about to do this? - Friends, please welcome to the stage Harmony and Luke! - Thank you, Shirley. And thank you everyone for being here to celebrate an incredible man and woman who have done so much for this town.

I heard that apparently some kid called Herman's band last night to tell them that the party was canceled. - You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? - I don't know that anything can happen. I don't live here for one. - Ooh smitten indeed. I don't think you have to worry about that part right now, just enjoy it. - Yeah. - And If last night was any preview for the Christmas Festival, huh, I can't wait! - No, no, we're not going to perform. But we are going to accompany over a dozen of Miracle's finest talents. - Well maybe you could make a small appearance. I don't think I've ever seen your dad as happy as he was last night watching you sing. You know he keeps that piano over there tuned up regularly for you, just in case. - He does? - Mm hmm. - I'll get it. Devin, what are you doing here? - I messed up Harmony. Look I never should have left you. - You can't just show up. - I just need five minutes, look I got you some flowers. So this is where you grew up huh? It's rustic. Awe. I missed you Harmony. I need you. I was just so stressed about the record, and the label, and everything getting so crazy I didn't realize how much I needed you. But I've been thinking a lot about us and there's something that I should've done a long time ago. So, what do ya say? Marry me. - Well the first batch seems perfect if you want. - Somebody say cookies are ready? - Mr. Collins so good to finally meet you, I'm Devin. Luke. - Harmony. - This a bad time? - Hey, I'm Harmony's fiance. - Fiance? - Yeah. - Right. I'm gonna go. - Luke, Luke, wait Luke. - What? - Just give me a minute. - You're engaged? - No, I don't know. - You don't know? - He just showed up and surprised me, I'm still trying to process everything. - Well by all means don't let me interrupt your process. - Luke! - You have any allergies? - Devin! - Who was that guy? - Harmony are you alright? - I'm gonna make some tea. - Tea, that would be a great idea. - Harmony, what's going on? - Honey why don't you follow me? - But I wanna know what's going on. - Devin, you and me, we're gonna have a talk, right now. - Okay, this way? - Why did you think it was okay to come here? - Because I wanted to surprise you, and I wanted to tell you that I made a mistake. Look Harm, we both know that you can be a little bit stubborn but, I'm willing to look past that. Now you and me, we make sense, this not so much. But we look good together, we've got history. Now I know I wasn't at my best, I admit that, but what I realized was, I was about to make the biggest mistake of my entire life by leaving you. I need you Harm. - Devin you can't just say things like that. - Well why not? I still know that we are meant to be together. Don't throw away all of these years. Harmony I need you on my team. You're my number one girl. - Oh my God! Harmony are you going to introduce us to the reason why you haven't had time for any of us? - Hi I'm Pamela. - Hi. - And my daughter Kayla she's your biggest fan, - We all are. - Do you mind? - Not at all, do you have a pen? - Pen, pen, pen. - I'll be right back. - Oh I just loved your last music video. - Oh thank you. - It was really, really good. - Now who do you won't me to make this out for? - April, Emily, Pamela, Trisha. - Weston wait up, hold on. - So it's true. Luke told me but I didn't believe him, but I guess it's true. - What's true? - That you're marrying that guy. - No, I don't know, I'm trying to figure it. - Don't do it. - What? - Don't. - I was hoping I'd find you here. - Here I am. - Can we talk? - You marrying Devin? - I don't know. - What does that even mean? - Look this isn't easy for me, okay? This isn't what I wanted to happen. - Really, from the looks of it I'd say it's exactly what you wanted to happen. Why are you even here? Shouldn't you be with your fiance. - No I wanted to talk to you, I thought that maybe. - That maybe I would what give you permission? - No! - Then what? - I don't know. - Yeah you do, but I'm not gonna decide your life the way he did. - Tell me there's nothing between us, tell me that I am the only one who can't stop thinking about that kiss. - What kiss?

You're my number one girl, but you can't pull this stuff while she's around okay? - What do you see in her anyways? - I don't, she's just the best songwriter I know, now get out of here. - Devin, your songwriter just heard all that. - Harmony, hold up I didn't mean to. - To what? To have that conversation while the mics were on? - Baby it's not what you think. - Even if it is, I don't care. I don't know what I was thinking coming back here with you, clearly I wasn't thinking. You know, you and I stopped being right a long time ago. - Baby don't say that, let's just please go inside. - No, Devin we're done, we've been done, I just didn't want to admit it before. It took me really falling in love with someone else to realize that. - Excuse me. - I love him. - Baby what are you talking about? - I love him. Oh Dev. It's been interesting, thank you for helping me realize that this isn't what I want at all. - Hey you've reached Julie's phone you know what to do, beep, just kidding. - Jules, Jules, turns out I can't get you those VIP tickets after all, but you should tell your friend that she doesn't want to see that lying, cheating, conniving snail trail of a man anyway. The best part is I don't even care! I think I've found someone actually worth fighting for. Merry Christmas! So - Harmony! Ry! - Pam have you seen Luke? - By the stage on the left. - Okay thank you. - Thanks for always showing up to the Christmas Festival. Okay now please welcome Clementine and Tyson. - Luke! - I'm kinda in the middle of something right now. - I know, I know and I am so sorry. - Shouldn't you be at a concert in LA? - No I left. Look I know what I want. - Congratulations. - Luke, Harmony's back! - I saw. - Well? - Well what? - What are you gonna do about it? - I'm gonna keep on working. - Don't be stupid. - Hey dad. - Harmony! What? What are you doing here? - I realized this is where I wanted to be. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Listen dad, I'm really sorry for not being here with you over the past few years, I've been a little lost. - Oh no, you've got nothing to be sorry about. - Let me finish. Ever since mom died, I've been running away and I haven't looked back. I think my heart was so broken that I wanted to pretend like it didn't exist. And I was so mad at you for moving on when I couldn't even begin. - Hold on sweetheart I never moved on. I never stopped loving your mother, I still love your mother. Everyday. - I shoulda been here, and I want to be here now. - You are here now. I couldn't be happier. - Oh and dad about Debbie. - Okay, no, no I'm not gonna force ya to have a relationship. - No I was wrong she's really wonderful, I would love to have a relationship with her. And if you love her the way that I think you do, I think you should marry her. - You do? - Yes. Life is short dad, we learned that the hard way. It just took me a little longer to catch up. - What about you? - What about me? - You're not wearing the ring. - Oh yeah, you noticed that huh? Well I know I don't need to tell you but Devin and I weren't really a great fit. - You out grew him. - Yeah, I think I did. And in the end we wanted very different things. But it's okay, I'm home now. - You know there's a very good man that also calls this town home? - Yeah, dad, I know where you're going with this and unfortunately this isn't a Hallmark Christmas fairytale okay? I thought he had feelings for me but he doesn't. - He told you that? - More or less. - What are you gonna do about that? - What can I do? - How about something crazy? - Which brings to mind, no Miracle Christmas Fes. Come here Harmony. - Hi, I'm Harmony. And I am so happy to be back here in my hometown with all of you. Miracle really is the best place for Christmas, and not just because of all of this. But because of all of the wonderful people here. Whether it's your first time visiting, whether you've been here forever, or whether you're returning after you've lost your way, the people of Miracle make this place home. I wrote this song with someone truly exceptional. Someone who reminded me what it is to love, who taught me to open my heart again, and who showed me the real beauty of Christmas. ♪ Fallen angels find your way ♪ ♪ Doubting friend ♪ ♪ gain your strength ♪ ♪ Empty glasses filled again ♪ ♪ Come forth ♪ ♪ Lonely mothers ♪ ♪ love once more ♪ ♪ Harden strangers ♪ ♪ dark my door ♪ ♪ Weary eyes regain color ♪ ♪ Come forth ♪ ♪ For my cathedral heart ♪ ♪ Filled with ♪ ♪ faith and feeling ♪ ♪ Stain all the windows gold ♪ ♪ Painted glory ceilings ♪ ♪ No more broken promises ♪ ♪ No more empty hymns ♪ ♪ For pilgrims ♪ ♪ seeking sanctuary ♪ ♪ Love is found within ♪ ♪ Love can be everywhere ♪ ♪ As long as there's ♪ ♪ a song to share ♪ ♪ Shepherds let ♪ ♪ it fill the air ♪ ♪ Come forth ♪ ♪ For my cathedral heart ♪ ♪ Filled with ♪ ♪ faith and feeling ♪ ♪ Stain all the windows gold ♪ ♪ Painted glory ceilings ♪ ♪ No more broken promises ♪ ♪ No more empty hymns ♪ ♪ For pilgrims ♪ ♪ seeking sanctuary ♪ ♪ Love is found within ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Within ♪ - Hey guys, can we do this one more time? - I thought it was perfect. - Couldn't be more perfect. - Guys focus, we're not talking about you here.
