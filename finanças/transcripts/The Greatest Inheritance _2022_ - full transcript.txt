Hello? Do you have the money yet? Yeah, I'm working on it. Kasey, you need to get it. I know, I know. Transfer the 20,000. Yeah, I will have it for you by tomorrow. Kasey, you're way past the due date. You don't just get free studio time and walk away without paying. Until you pay up, consider the recordings mine. Yeah, okay, I'll have it to you by Monday. Where are you? I'm on a music video shoot, I gotta go. Ticket please. Yeah, I'll get it at the next town. You have to have a ticket. You've never had someone need to get a ticket at the next town. No, ma'am. Well, out here, where is everyone getting a ticket? Everyone just magically has a ticket? Yes, they magic it off the computer. Look, I'm having a really bad day and I, you know how it is, I left the house, I don't have it. Then you have to get off the bus. Now unless you have cash 'cause we take that, too. Well, my wallet was stolen. I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're gonna have to exit the bus. No. - No? - No. I'm not getting off this bus. I have to be on this bus, it's important. Ma'am, you can't ride this bus if you don't pay for a ticket. Now, please get off the bus. Excuse me, get off the bus now. Hey, don't you know who I am? No, I don't, but I'm about to call the police. Okay. I'm calling. She looks really familiar. Yeah, I definitely seen her before. She looks like an older version of Kasey Striker. That's it, that's her! Kasey Striker! Hey Kasey, I loved you when I was 10. What is she doing on a bus? I don't know. Thanks a lot, awesome. ♪ Don't waste this precious time ♪ ♪ We're all born to die ♪ ♪ All we have is now ♪ ♪ So choose to live it well ♪ ♪ Wherever I go you are always ♪ Hi, pumpkin. Hello, Kasey, it's your mother. I have something to read to you. There once was a farmer who planted seeds. Some of the seeds fell on a path, the birds ate them. These seeds are like those who hear the message of the kingdom and don't understand it. Some seeds fell on rocky soil. - Hey, hey! - Sun scorched them. ♪ Breathe deep, my dear ♪ ♪ Your chariot awaits ♪ ♪ And may you live in peace ♪ ♪ Just let go and feel the breeze ♪ Can you help me? My sister threw Princess up in the tree! What happened? Where is it? Oh, I see it. Ha! Us little sisters have to stick together. Thanks, what are you doing out here? Well, I'm trying to get home. I know I'd be sad if I went home without Princess, I bet your mom's missing you. I don't think so. Okay, I'll see you around. Great. - Oh! - Sorry. Are you okay? Have you hitchhiked all the way from California? Well, I lost my wallet. Really? What happened? - Hi, Emily, hi, Lance. - Hi. Hey. It's been a while since I've seen you. - Picture? - Oh, sure. Oh, that's cute. Kasey, how did you lose your wallet? Oh, it got stolen. Wait, you just said that you lost it. Which one is it? Lost, stolen, same diff. Not really, but... Doesn't matter anyway. Well, I didn't realize that things were so tight. Well, you wouldn't know what that's like. I've struggled too, Kasey. Struggled, past tense. Okay, I didn't realize things were so arbitrary. Easy for you to say coming from someone with everything. Well, we can't take it with us, Aunt Kasey. That's true. Yeah, but you can take it everywhere else until you die, Rachel. So I can assume you won't be paying back my loan anytime soon? What, that was years ago! It's way overdue. It's not like you need it anyway. Okay, that, that's enough, ladies. Can I charge my phone? I'm waiting on an important business call. Really, that's amazing! You're making things happen? Sure. I don't know where the charger is in this car. It's a rental, Emily got into an accident. Mom! Oh, don't worry, Emily. I used to get in accidents at your age all the time. Is that why you don't have a car? Well, you know, public transportation is better for the environment. Oh, well, mom won't let me take public transportation. Well, New York's dangerous. But aren't you like 18 or something? Yeah, almost. Well, what they don't know won't hurt them. Don't listen to her, Emily. Unless you want good advice. Lying to people is not good advice. Yeah, she's right, it's better to control them. Ladies, show some respect. We're on our way to bury your mother. - Looks smaller to me. - Yeah. Looks bigger to me. Yeah, bigger than Sophia. - Oh. - Alright. I got this, sorry. - Got it, you sure? - Yeah. - Ooh. - Ooh, where's that heat coming from? Oh, wow. Thought we were just staying for one night. Is that a designer bag? I bought it for Sophia for her birthday. Wow, nice birthday present. Well, they're in politics. They have to look good. Well, is it really politics if you're just a small town mayor? It's probably full of shoes. Really impractical shoes. - Don't be rude, Rachel. - I'm not. Hey, I mean, I love her shoes. Hi, Aunt Sophia! Oh, oh, okay, hey, are Charley and Beth inside already? Wow, your Spanish is getting really good. Gracias. I absolutely loved your last episode, Rachel. I bought that miracle green juice and it's working wonders on my skin. I'm so happy. And you have to tell me where you got those shoes you are wearing. You must give me your stylist's info. Oh, this is not shoes, it's bricks. You leave your guitar case here, I can come back out and get it. Oh, no, no, it's got a finicky handle, so I got it. Okay. Ooh, you all right, babe? Yeah, no, I can. Okay? I got it. I love this house. Yeah, it's beautiful. Hey, you guys! How was the drive, alright? You would know if you had called me back. I thought your phone died. Oh yeah. I didn't know you guys were bringing Kasey. Well, neither did we. Good choice. What is all this? George and I are blue, Kasey is green, Carrie is purple, and Rachel, you and your family have pink. Just put it on everything that you want. Is there anything left? What, little sis, no hug? Hi, hi! How are you? Is that valuable? It's probably worth a couple thousand. That's great. Kasey, this isn't a game. I know. What are y'all doing to my house? If you see something that you like, you just use this. It's mine and my family traditions. And technically this is mom's house. I live here and some of these things belong to me. We can do this later, sweetie. No, we're not doing this later. Besides, mom left a will. I bought this lamp, it's mine. Calm down, it's just a lamp. But it's my lamp. I'm sure Mom split everything up evenly. She can't split up my possessions. We should discuss what we're gonna do with this house. Oh, finally, you're all here. Who's this guy? Well, I am really excited to get this started. Well, not the burial, of course, That would be inappropriate, but everything else, everything else, I'm really excited to get started. You know what, never mind, I'll just introduce myself. I am Mr. Shepard, I'm your mother's attorney. I am also the executor of her will. Oh, good, okay, are we gonna read that now? I'm gonna like you. Kasey, Kasey Striker. Oh, now, did you marry? Because I didn't see your husband's name on the list. Her last name is DuBose, Striker is made up. It's her stage name. Rachel DuBose, I've been looking forward to meeting you. I'm a huge fan. - Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm. I actually legally changed it, so. Wonderful. Follow me, and we will lay your mother to rest. We're burying her here? We're spreading her ashes. Didn't you read the letter that Mr. Shepard sent? I want you all to know that your mom was an exceptional woman. And over the past weeks, I've spent a lot of time with her, and she put a lot of time into this. And she asked that I begin by reading the Lord's prayer. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come, Your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever, amen. Amen. Mom's favorite scripture was, "There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens, a time to be born and a time to die," Ecclesiastes 3:1-2. Mom cherished every moment, lived her life to the fullest. She truly believed that what you sow here on earth, you reap in heaven. She believed that's where we receive our true inheritance. But everything here on earth is fleeting. She talked a lot about that in her final days. Y'all would know that if you had bothered to visit. Mom was a winner. She brought this family into greatness and her legacy will live on. I'm gonna name a street after her. Mom, every Monday, there was a note on my dressing room table from you. You'd write an encouraging scripture verse and you always reminded me to put other people first. I'm going to miss that. Grandma, I'm gonna miss you so much, but I know, that I'm gonna see you again in heaven. Thank you for calling me every night just to pray with me, for always encouraging me to go to youth group. Your mother accepted me into this family for who I was with unconditional love. All come from dust and to dust all return. Okay, so are we gonna read the will? That's what you have to say? I need to know what I'm gonna get. Yes, here we are. You have activated the special rule. If any of my children ask about their inheritance within five minutes of spreading my ashes, read the two following scriptures: The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets, "I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world." Inform my children that the deed is hidden on the property. The first one to find it shall inherit my entire estate. What? A treasure in a field? Just read the will. Oh, I don't have it. Where is it? It appears it's hidden somewhere on the property. I don't know anything. You didn't know Mom was gonna do this? Nope, she didn't tell me. I don't believe Mom would do this. This is a joke, right? Mr. Shepard, we all traveled a very long way. We came here for one night to put Mom's affairs in order and lay her to rest. This is not the appropriate time for games and tricks. I understand. If any of my children ask about their inheritance within five minutes of the service, you will inform them that the deed can be found somewhere on the property. - Now it also says that- - Yeah, yeah. I think we got that, we heard that. What does this mean? It means first to find the deed inherits everything. What, like you guys didn't wanna know what you inherited. I think Mom meant for me to have the house. I have lived here my entire life, I should get it. No, no, no, I'm the oldest, I should get it. I meant that, we should all get it, that Mom would want us to all have the house. Well, obviously not, and we're not gonna keep it. We're gonna sell it, and we're gonna split it 40/20/20/20. Why would you get 40%? Because I have the least out of all of us. Listen, we each get 25%. I don't want to sell this house. It's not up to just you. That's right, it's up to the one who finds the deed. Rachel, you can buy my share of the house. - No! - Yeah. You know what, you can buy mine, too. Where did Kasey go? The first one to find the deed inherits everything, but there's a lot more to it than that, though, if you would just indulge me. Well, I guess I'm just a guy holding a rule book. Emily, your grandmother requested that this was all documented with photos. Would you mind doing the honors? Yeah, yeah, of course, you first. Oh, don't mind if I do get my good side. Alright. Mom! Where can I find good reception around here, bro? No Wi-Fi on the premises, sir. Come on. I don't see it, George. Sophia, why are you wearing those ridiculous shoes? You don't have to act a part here, you know. You could just be. They make me feel powerful. Alright, it's not here. Mom would get such a kick out of us right now. And Dad would just be rolling his eyes. I'm not really dressed for this. George, you should've left your shoes outside. You are tracking dirt all through my house. You mean Mom and Dad's house. I packed plenty of shoes, George. Thank you. Yeah, it's not just your house, Carrie. You know, if I find this, I'm keeping the whole thing for myself. This is our family home. Not if I find it, those are the rules. Let's find a way to make this fair for everyone. Huh, you haven't found the deed yet, have you? This property is huge, it could be anywhere on it. Indeed, as I've tried to tell you, your mother left very specific instructions if you're ready to listen to me. Good. Now there are challenges that lead to clues that lead you closer to the deed, but you have to work together as a family to complete those challenges and get those clues. Of course. Got to be kidding me. She couldn't just die, she had to have the last word. No, Kasey, you had to have the last word. That's what started all of this. Okay, I thought I was done with all the little kid stuff when I left. Why didn't you warn us, Carrie? You've been here the whole time. Thank you for acknowledging that, I know I was. Again, you didn't know Mom was making this game? Not this. I knew she was making something, but she was always making stuff. You know Mom, all the way up to the end. What are you talking about? Mom's games. Remember that story I told you about my 10th birthday? Exactly, 10 friends, 10 clues, in 10 hours. I spent forever in the barn looking for that stupid needle in the haystack clue. And all along, it was hidden in the culvert by the road. I got stuck in there trying to find that last clue. Ripped my favorite dress, still have the scar to prove it. Wait, wait, you climbed in a culvert? Like you, my, my mom? I really wanted to win. Yeah, but George always wins. Nothing wrong with being a winner. Wait a minute, Mr. Shepard, you said that we have to all work together to get the clues. That's what it says right here in the book. But you also said that the person who finds the deed gets to inherit everything. Oh, the whole shebang. It doesn't make any sense. Why would we all work together for one person to get everything? Oh, that would be an excellent question for your mother. But now that Kasey has unlocked this part of the game, I mean, I can only say what's here in this book, and your mother was very specific about all of this. I mean, look at this book that she made. And she planned everything right down to the smallest detail. Now, how this all turns out, well, that's up to you all. So this is the only way we're going to get our inheritance? No, we don't have to play. I mean, you could just tell us where it is. No, it's legally binding. Only Mom would make a game legally binding. We could fight it in court. Well, technically you can do whatever you want with the will. I mean, you can make the terms whatever you like. That's actually my specialty, strange contacts and agreements. That's why your mother hired me. You know, I once had a client that refused to give his family their inheritance until each and every one of them showed up to his funeral wearing a chicken suit. - You're kidding, right? - Oh no, I'm not. But seriously, I'm with Rachel, we should fight this. You might be able to fight it. But in the meantime, you should know if someone or anyone finds that deed, well, they could inherit the entire estate. My estate? Well, it's technically not yours yet, settle down. So you're saying that even a non-family member could inherit it? Oh yes, even the pizza guy. That's why I would recommend that you find it here and now. Well, what about you? Oh, me? I, well, I'm the will's executor, so I'm disqualified. It keeps everything fair and legal. Okay, let's get this over with. Excellent. If you'll follow me into the kitchen, I have your first challenge prepared. Right this way, well, come on. She made these! Yep, and I made this one for myself. Look at that. Yeah, I'm not wearing this. Kasey, Mom worked hard on these. Have some respect for her dying wish. It's the least you can do. Yeah, but I don't cook. Where God cooks, there is no smoke. You never learned to cook, Kasey. Challenge number one. There's a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens. There's a time for war, and there's a time for peace. Mom used to say that to me all the time when we were in the kitchen together. Well, you must work together to complete this challenge. The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into the flour until it's worked through the dough. Now, your meal must be completed and you must have the full family experience from cooking to dining. I love the smell of fresh bread. Not only that, it's the whole DuBose Sunday dinner. Okay, let's, start with the trinity. Here, Rachel, you chop that up. You mean mirepoix? Same thing, onions, celery, carrots. The holy trinity of French and Cajun cuisine. Start your meal with this and it will be amazing. Mum loved mirepoix. She used to say, "Put the trinity in your food "and you'll put it in your soul." You know what, Carrie? I miss your good old-fashioned home cooking. Alright, put this on the stove top to get hot. Okay. Kasey, boil some water in here. - And, let's see- - Nope! That does not qualify. Why not? All four siblings must participate together in order to complete the challenge and get the clue. - Oh. - Kasey. I don't make the rules. I just hold the book. I'll find her. ♪ I should have known a long time ago ♪ ♪ I lost my love when I left my home ♪ ♪ The waiting was to hard to feel ♪ ♪ the waiting made a lonely man steal ♪ ♪ The money came calling and you fell right in ♪ ♪ Your mama don't like it when she sees your old friends ♪ ♪ You can catch a sinner, you can't make him ♪ Kasey? ♪ But maybe we were born to stay ♪ What are you doing in Mom's bathroom? I was actually looking for her guitar, but then I found this. Nice try, but you gotta to join us. You know, I actually can't remember this. Let me see. You know what? This was your kindergarten recital. You don't remember that? No. You stole the show. Aw! You know, you were always like me. Lighten up in front of a crowd. Ah. - Well, look at this one. - Look at that! That's when we did community theater together. - Wow, good times, huh? - Mm-hmm. Now come on, join us, besides, it's in the rules. Oh, I don't care about the rules. We'll get this over with faster if we work together. That's not my problem, I'm gonna find this thing first. Oh, and if you don't? Well then, one of you good Samaritans will just share yours with me. Hey, I did my good deed last year when I loaned you that money. Huh. Well, then I might as well just come on out and say it. This is stuck. Nice. You know, you always seem to find yourself in these situations, Kasey. No, I think you always seem to find me in these situations. That doesn't look like it's coming off. Ugh, I guess I'll just have to keep it. Or we just take off the whole finger. Hey. You know what? I have something in my room that'll sort everything out. Trust me. George, this scratching my new oven. This is ridiculous guys, uncuff me. We're just protecting you from getting more rings stuck. Well, it was an accident. That's my favorite ring. Okay. Then I'll take it off. Just uncuff me, I'll use soap. Do y'all remember that time when Kasey would not come down for dinner? Every time George went up to get her, he'd come back down saying that she wouldn't leave her room. And Mom finally had to go up there and get you herself, remember? Yes, she found me handcuffed to my bedpost. That was the best idea I ever had. Although I didn't know I'd be reusing that same idea on you as an adult to keep you around instead of to keep you away. You guys, you'll get way more use out of me with two hands. You can trust me, I promise. Prove it. Hey, let's say, Grace. Oh, come on. Mom's not even here, we don't have to do that. Dear Lord, thank You so much for this food. May it nourish our bodies and give us strength to complete Mom's last request. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Okay, we're done, what's the next clue? This is delicious, by the way. Thank you. You haven't completed the challenge yet. We cooked a meal together, we're eating together. Alright, we have to finish it. Everybody shovel it in. Kasey, slow down, you're gonna choke. What, why would you say that? Just like when she was little. Okay, really, eat. Or it's the only way we're gonna get this clue. I'm with Kasey. Let's hurry up, I have to get to work in the morning. How long is this going to take? Well, it depends on you. What you do and how you do it. Do you remember that crazy Easter when we were kids? When did you finally find your basket, Kasey? Days. Yeah. And she cried so much. I wasn't that bad, you guys. Oh my gosh, you were. I remember by the third day, you laid in the middle of the kitchen floor bawling. We had searched and searched and we couldn't figure out the clue, and Mom kept saying, "You're hot, girls, you're so hot." We looked in the fridge and we opened every cabinet. And then from your spot on the floor in your pool of tears, you looked up. It was duct taped to the bottom of the dining room table. I was so exhausted and frustrated, I just laid there. While we un-taped it and laid it next to you. You remember. Yeah, I remember you guys standing around and laughing at me. No, we weren't laughing at you. I laid there for a long time rubbing your back. I always took care of you. Mom just wanted us to work together. So what do we do now? Carrie, can you reread the challenge card? "There is a time for war and a time for peace." My rose today is reminiscing with you all about our childhood. My rose is that for the first time in a long time, we cooked a meal together as a family. It's been really nice to have y'all back under this roof. My rose and my thorn are the same thing. We buried our mother, but it brought us together. I like this roses and thorns thing. You each say something good and bad about your day. Kasey, you still have to say something. My thorn is that I handed my sister her career on the night of my last concert. Are you kidding me, Kasey? That was a long time ago. She wouldn't be a TV star if I hadn't been a rockstar. They have nothing to do with each other. What? She'd been nothing without me. Cobra gave your sister her fame. Cobra was my guitarist. Cobra fell off your stage and became her patient. Back up, can somebody fill me in on this story? I am so sick of this story. Kasey was rocking out on a stage and the audience started getting a little rowdy. Now, her lead guitarist, Cobra, he got pulled into a mosh pit by a sea of screaming women. Now, he hit the ground hard and was knocked unconscious. Next thing you know, a beautiful blond comes running out on the stage from the wings. She literally dove into the audience, pulled Cobra back onto stage, resuscitated him, and saved his life. He broke his hand in seven different places. He was my other half and they canceled my tour. How was that her fault, she saved a man's life. Because he wanted to come back on tour with me, and she told them not to, and she recommended a surgery that would take a year of recovery. She made the right call, Kasey. He's still playing to this day. Yeah, well, and I'm not. Can we just move on? Well, congratulations, you've completed the challenge. Now, I will read the clue, but first you each get to select an item from this hat that no matter who gets the deed, you get to keep. Go ahead, help yourself. I get the big pizza oven. Wait a second, I think I paid for that. I get the cuckoo clock. Awesome, most annoying chimes ever. Just don't set it to every hour like Mom did. What'd you get? Oh, I get Mom and Dad's old station wagon. That's mine. Great, Mom's china set. I always wanted Mom's china. Then you can buy it off me. Okay, I will read the clue. Don't store up treasures here on earth where moths eat them and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal. Look to your childhood hiding spot for your next challenge. I don't think I had a hiding spot, my diary? I had things at my friend's house. I had a lock box, but I don't think Mom had the key. Maybe she found the key. It is a delicious meal. Yeah. Hey, Mom, did you really ruin Aunt Kasey's career? Of course I didn't. Then why does she blame you? Because Aunt Kasey has a hard time taking responsibility for herself. Okay, then why did she stop making music? You'll have to ask her. Your Aunt Kasey can make music with or without a stadium full of people just like I can help people whether I'm on TV or not. Yeah. I found 'em! Yes, there you go. Oh! I thought I cut the head off that doll and flushed it down the toilet. No, that was Malibu Barbie. This Barbie I made because there was no such thing as Dr. Barbie when I was a kid. Mom and Dad said there was nothing we couldn't do. Hey, who wants to hear my speech for class president? No. But look at this. Oh, Carrie, that was my favorite restaurant growing up. I can't believe y'all actually ate my mud pie. We spit it out. Wow, that was fast, you guys are good at this game. You ready for your next challenge? I'm exhausted. Alright, challenge number two. And Jesus said, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to those who are like these children," Matthew 19:14. Remember your youth by playing a game of Capture the Flag. I'm getting too old for this. Yeah, and it's dark outside. What? No, don't be wimps, we got this. It's been a long day, let's make a rule. We'll break from 10:00 p.m to 8:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m? I don't get up before 10:00. Maybe, that's why you're unemployed. Great, I'll see you at 8:00. Oh, they'll get up for that money. Hello, Kasey, it's your mother. I have something to read to you. There once was a farmer who planted seeds. Some of the seeds fell on a path, the birds ate them. These seeds are like those who hear - the message of the kingdom... - Hey. - "And don't understand." - Hi. Oh, you don't want this tape? It's just dumb old songs from when I was young and stupid. Well, I bet they're really good. You know, I'm kind of busy. Okay, well, can I borrow it? Yeah, you can have it. Oh, can I use this? Go for it. You know, my mom gave me your album. I love your music. Really? Yeah, oh, "Lives of Our Youth" is the best. I think there's an early version of that on the B side. Hit play. This is a new one, it's called "My Stars." I changed the title when I put it on my album. ♪ Let down your guard, I'll be ♪ - Can I see your guitar? - No. ♪ Standing so tall with plastic covers in the hall ♪ Don't you miss all this? Fame is empty. ♪ I don't wanna try so hard ♪ So you don't want it back? There's nothing quite like the adoring fans who want your autograph and your photo. But you just said it was empty. It is, but I like to be liked. I like you, Aunt Kasey. Really? Would you do something for me? I say, you and I team up to find the deed, like a aunt and niece bonding kind of thing. Really? And then, if we find the deed, I can give you 10% of the money I get. Oh, I would do it just to be with you. Perfect, then I'll give you 5%. Okay, you take the first shift tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. Okay, I'll go tell my mom. Unless, we find it tonight. Isn't that against the rules? Cool kids like us don't play by the rules. I mean, you wanna be just like me, right? Then go downstairs and see if the coast is clear. - I knew it! - Shh. I knew I was gonna find you here! What are you doing? What are you doing here? I'm looking for the deed. Did you find it? You think I would sneak around if I did? Coast is clear. Perfect. I always envisioned I would come back to live in this house someday. You know, I've been thinking. I think I should come home and be mayor of this town. Thought you always wanted to be president. And that comes with a house. Yeah, but I think I'm better at town flipping, actually. It's my specialty. Town flipping? Yeah, you know, it's like house flipping. People buy houses, they fix them up, they sell them. That's what I'm gonna do with towns. Okay. I'm assuming if y'all found it, you wouldn't be sitting here. No. Shh, you're gonna wake someone up. I'm sorry. Well, I don't want to flip this house. I want to live in it. If Kasey finds the deed before we do, that's the first thing she'll do, she'll sell it. That's the second thing she'll do. The first thing she'll do is lord it over us. I might be ready to be done with this place. This house holds family memories! All my memories are of caring for our dying parents. You didn't have to do that! We coulda hired someone to help her. That was your choice. It didn't feel like a choice, y'all left. Besides, I wasn't gonna hire a stranger to take care of my own mother. After dad died, I invited her to come live with me. It had all of her memories, it was her home. Well, this is also why I want the house. Again, that was her choice, and you chose to stay. I chose to put her needs above my own. So what do you wanna do now? Open my own cafe. You should do that. That's why I want my inheritance. Well, that's exactly why we need to find the deed before Kasey does. Wow, thanks so much for inviting me to this little family meeting. Kasey, stop being so dramatic. Listen, guys, I have a new plan and I really need the house now. I'm gonna put this town on the map. Yeah, well, I really need the money. Kasey, money is not more valuable than our family home. Yes, it is when you really need the money. You have a townhouse in New York City and a house in the Hamptons. Why do you need another house, you're just being greedy. I'm with Kasey, I could use the money. Thank you, okay. Hey, let's make a pact, how about this? If one of us finds it, we split it equally. I'll take it. Okay. Rachel. - Hmm? - Help me be mayor of this town. Deal. Mayor? I'm gonna do something good for my hometown. You're coming home now, now that mom has died? That's great, George, just great. It was your choice to stay. I still live here! Maybe I'll let you have the guest house. Hey, Kasey? Yeah? Just seeing if you have that money that you borrowed from me? Yes, yeah, I'm working on it. - Sorry. - Okay, cool. No, if we find the deed, maybe you can just pay me back from your share of the inheritance. Yeah, great, goodnight, sis. Goodnight, hey, let's find this deed. Yes. Okay. What am I gonna do without you? Rach, I didn't plan on one your mom's adventures. Although I should've seen it coming. We're almost done. Babe, come on, this could take days. I know. Thanks for sticking up for me. I can't believe she still goes on and on about that concert. As much as I like being your knight in shining armor, I think it's time to settle that feud. I don't know how to. Be the bigger person. Maybe, you suck it up and say you're sorry. Not only that, even if it wasn't your fault, you made a call and it hurt your sister, you know? And if you hadn't become Cobra's doctor, you wouldn't have become Dr. Rachel, and the world needs you. So I should apologize. If you want a relationship with your sister. Might loosen things up. It might solve the problem. She seems to be going through a rough time right now. Just have some compassion. I feel like she's always going through a rough time. This would be so much easier if Kasey wasn't so Kasey. You can't expect somebody to be something they're not. We need to love them for who they are. Alright, I'll see you and Emily soon. Okay, try not to get hurt looking for that deed. Rachel, give her a chance, okay? Sure, she's a little curmudgeon. I know, but she's my little curmudgeon. Yeah, that's my girl, love you, baby. Love you, be safe. What are you doing? - I'm stretching. - Get focused. I am, it's yoga.

Sweetie, what happened, are you okay? - Are you okay? - I'm good. - I'm okay. - Did you hurt your ankle or your wrist? - You all right? - I'm good. - I'm good. - Okay. - You sure? - Yes. Hey, hey, - I'll take her inside. - Thank you, Emily. Thank you, okay, thanks. Aw, there she goes again. Keeping people from winning 'cause she's gotta be Dr. Rachel all the time. And the winning team is team Kasey, Carrie and Emily. Go ahead and choose your prizes. The grand piano. Aw, man, I want the piano. Well, what did you get? Great-Aunt Helen's green afghan. Okay, I'll give you the piano if you give Rachel the china. I'll think about it. What's the next clue? Alright, clue number two. "There's a time for everything and a season for every activity under the heavens, a time to weep and a time to laugh." Where did I go to laugh? Where do we go to cry? Or we do both? The doll house! ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ Oh, yes it is right now ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ I was here first. - Ow, ow! - Rachel, ow! You hit my thigh! - I'm sorry! - Watch out, guys! Oh, look at baby George! - Aw! - Look at how... Oh my gosh, Rachel, you are the youngest. Wow, Kasey, you are strong your mom. She does. I can't believe mom kept this picture of me and George. W. Wow, she saved so many things from our childhood. I can't believe she kept the ticket stubs from my first concert. I had goosebumps the entire time you were there. Mom was so proud of you. We all were. That was where my happiest times. And your life's not over yet Kasey. I hope the best for me is still yet to come. - Me too. - Yeah. Kind of feels like the best is behind me though. I mean, you all were so proud of me. What does that say about me now, that I'm not successful? I wasn't proud of you because you were successful. She was proud that you were using the voice God gave you. She loved you. She loved all of us. For who we are, not what we do. Are we using our gifts for God? ♪ So stay close to the one. ♪ - Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry, I can go... No, it's cool. ♪ You and stay close to ♪ ♪ So I stay close to you ♪ I don't remember hearing this one on your album. It wasn't gonna be a top 10, so I cut it. I like it. Can I tell you something? Sure. Okay, but just don't tell my mother, please. Oh, well, now I'm intrigued. Now you have to tell me. I wanna be a singer. Really? Let me guess, she doesn't approve? She doesn't think it's a sustainable job. Well, she might have a point there. But I wanna be a Christian musician. Oh, Amy Grant was my hero growing up. Oh my goodness! Oh, my mom has a ton of Amy Grant. Oh well, your mom was actually the first person to take me to one of her concerts. She and I were diehard fans. And we used to spend so much time in your mom's room listening to records over and over and over again until they skipped. And then we begged grandma to take us to the Christian bookstore, the second something new got on the shelves. Sometimes we'd wait outside in line for hours. Is that the ticket? Wait, that's you! How cool. Look, it's a B for the B-side. Yeah. Grandma thought of everything. Yeah. I think mom was my number one fan. She still is. Yeah. Just not on this planet. No, my mom. My mom is your number one fan. I hope you make another album soon Aunt Kasey. Yeah, working on it. And Hey, why don't you write more songs about God? Because, I don't think they would make pretty much money. Each of us has a gift to use to serve others. On the real world, I mean, you have to look out for yourself. I'm sure whoever said that was rich. No, it's from the Bible. - Oh! - Yeah. Some people will believe that we're all here to fit together in this intricate way. So like what you do and say, compliments what others do. And it all works together for God's purpose. Seems kind of crazy, I guess, but it makes sense to me. I have got an idea. It's better be good Kasey, I had just fallen asleep. Okay guys, we have got to get back to our lives. I mean, I love mom, I love what she's doing for us, sorta, not really, but we have to get a move on. So I say, we corner Mr. Shepard and demand he tell us where the deed is. Oh, I was kind of having fun playing this game. I want to see what mom came up with. That's sweet Carrie 'cause you live here, but this could go on for days. I mean the book would have the answer. Let's go get it. Shh, where did you get this? I'm always prepared to blend in with the night. I'm sorry I didn't pack you one, honey. - Do I have one? - Of cause, it's at home. Why do I have had one of those? Are y'all coming? Well, you scared me. Oh, it's good to see you guys are taking this seriously. Oh, is this an interesting turn of events? Okay buddy, hand over the book. Why? It's time for us to get back to our lives so tell us where the deed is, now. The answers are not in this book and I don't know where that deed is. What do you mean that deed? Is it more than one? I don't know. It's what your mother wanted you to do. She's structured this game to ensure that you played by her rules. Okay, but this is ridiculous I mean, she's not even here to play with us. Exactly. Your mother told me she knew all of you would only come back home to bury her and get your money and this was the only way to get her family back together. That's the last time you all came to visit her? I took care of her. I gave Carrie medical advice for her all the time. I admit, I should've come home more often. We didn't know that she was going to die. Okay, you guys come on, look, we're wasting time here. Can you just tell us where it is, now. Okay, got a special room here, just for you. If any of my children demand or threatened Mr. Shepard to reveal where the deed is before they find it, that will enforce a time limit. I think this qualifies as threatening. And if they don't find the deed before the next sundown, everything I own will be giving up between my favorite charities, even the things they have won. How do you like that? - She knew you. - what? No, no, no way. But I paid for the pizza oven. I honestly didn't see this coming. It's all your fault Kasey. You keep getting penalized. Quit blaming me for mom's games. Plus, it was George who even threatened. Okay, you guys can spend all night playing the blame game, but can you do it somewhere else, I need sleep. And might I suggest that you get some rest because tomorrow you got challenged number three and less time. Oh, that's classy. Nobody's scared of you. Okay, we need a game plan 'cause I some seriously. From now on, we really need to work together. And agree to split everything evenly. Even if someone else finds it first, That's what I'm saying. Are you in for real this time? I am. As long as you promise to buy me out of my shares of the house and Carrie's. Actually, I changed my mind, I wanna keep the house. It was our parents' home, it should stay in the family. Great, so now you're on their side? Well, none of us are gonna get it if we don't find it by tomorrow night. Are you in Kasey? I just don't like being left out. Then join the team DuBose. You swear? Raise your right hand and put your left hand on the Bible. You soundly swear, Kasey DuBose, that if you find a deed first, you will split the inheritance equally among all your siblings. I swear. Well then go team DuBose. Team DuBose.

Now for everything there is a season and activity under the heaven, time to plant and time to harvest that it was once a farmer from spread the seeds. Now some of the seed landed on dry Rocky ground some landed on the weeds and some landed in rich soil. The kingdom of heaven y'all, is like the seed. That you take, the seeds that you plant them wisely and you will only get the next clue after you've planted them all in the correct place. I like this game. I used to garden with mom all the time. Well, where did you use to help replant? I mean, that's where we should go. I say we should start here in our old truck garden. It feels good and there's probably even fertilizer in it. Well, when I move in, I'll probably gonna have all this removed. You're not removing mom's truck garden. I need room for a putting green. - No! - No! It's like, it's been a while since you've done this with mom. Weeds grow quickly. What weed? You know that parable says, weeds choke out new plants, so, we should probably clean out the bed before we plant. You're gonna give me one of these for my birthday. It's choked. It's gonna take awhile. Yeah, choked with memories. Let's do this right? I am doing it right. I put the seeds in the garden and I covered them with dirt. You know, this is nice. What, arguing about whether seeds want to be planted with doctor-like precision or not? Being together. I've missed you. I know, I've missed me too. I'm serious. We were so close. But you don't know what it feels like to love something so much and you loose it. I do. I had no idea that my decisions would have such an impact on your career. I know, that's what you do. Ouch! No, no, I meant helping people. But mom said about using our gifts for God that's what you did, you healed someone. Thank you for saying that. You used your gifts for good, and I used mine for myself. Hey, did mom leave you a weird message on your voicemail? I missed this call from her just before she passed and... And I didn't call her back, you know me. I meant to, but then... Anyway, I've listened to it about a hundred times, you know, just to hear her voice again. What did it say? It was a poem verse thing about gardening. I think I'm just hurt that she would call and use a Bible verse of all things for her last words to me. I didn't get that message. Me either. The only time mom ever gave me a ring, just when she wanted me to bring her dinner. I'm sure she meant something important by that. Okay, we are done. Oh, I'll be right with you, I'm almost finished here. You're welcome to give me the book and I could read the clues. Oh, that's my job. Well, then read it already. I'm sorry, you are incorrect. - What?! - Are we sure this is where we were supposed to plant. Well, it could be anywhere. There's gotta be more to the clue. Hey, this, this is a parable and illustration, you know? So maybe it's not literal. Like we're not supposed to plant the seeds? These are mustard seeds. How do you know? Because my youth leader passed them out recently, Bible study as an example. There's so small. - kingdom of heaven... - Is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and put in his own garden. And with the faith of a mustard seed, - you can... - Tell them mountain to move and it will move. Okay, let's stay on track. We're talking about gardens, not mountains, sorry. Did we ever have our own gardens here? No, they were always Mom's. You know, the end of that versus the best. Your soul shall be like a well-watered garden. Oh, it's us. The faith of the mustard seed is inside us. What? We're supposed to eat the seeds. It's a metaphor for God living in our hearts. Yes. If you're wrong, we're done. We won't be able to get the seeds back. I'm certain. Kasey, wait. Down the hatch. Only one way to know if I'm right. I hope this is right. Alright. Yeah. We'll done. The clues were on the truck tyre. I was right. Hey. Scription. - Read? - In. The. Now, clue number three is in four parts. "The", what is this? You got to figure it out. I know, I'm trying to think. "In ", like indoors inside, in between? Interesting? Read, scription, go, in. Wait guys, is it, read the inscription? Oh, that's right! Read the inscription! Which inscription, mom loved inscriptions. Remember the inscription we put on the gazebo for mom and dad's 50th wedding anniversary. Well, I guess it's somewhere, what did you guys put on it? There's only one way to find out. Come on. It might be buried, I'm grabbing the shovels. Time to search and time - to quit searching? - Time to quit searching? It's gotta be here. What is Mr. Shephard doing? Man, Mom must have paid him a lot to do all this. It's like he's enjoying this. Were they close? He was here a lot. I just thought mom was having a hard time figuring out who got what, boy, was I wrong. We will find anything? This doesn't seem right. It's too random. There's another inscription. There's one hanging by the lake. George, a hand please. We cant dig up the whole lake. "A time to grieve and a time to dance." I don't get it, I don't know what that means. Guys, I think we're just in the wrong place again. You're stressing me out now. Don't speak Spanish. Give me the cards, I know this property backwards and forwards. I know it too. Not like I do, give it to me. - No. - George. - No. - Give it. - No. - George! No, no. Why did you do that?! I didn't mean to, it was an accident. You ruined them. I spotted something just before you jumped on my back. You ruined them, why don't you just give them to me? I could find the right inscription. Oh, you could've figured it out. Why don't you solve it right away then. They shouldn't have to solve anything. I already paid my dues with mom and dad. I should have my choice of the inheritance. I have spent my entire life here taking care of them. First dad, and then mom. And now all of you just get to saunter back into my life. And so you want things, after all the hard work is done? Well, no, I'm glad the cards got destroyed. I'm glad you won't get any of this. You don't deserve any of it anyway. You don't really mean that. Now, please don't fight, he is your big brother. Oh, don't get us started on you. You marry into this family and then you show up here trying to claim my stuff, putting your notes on everything. What?! Go easy on her, she's been helping us. Thank you, Kasey. Are you okay sweetie? Are you okay. George, do you remember what you saw right before we fill in? Aunt Kasey, your guitar case, it has an inscription! What are you doing with my guitar case? The inscription. No, put it down. I know, this could be it, - it's... - It's not... Oh! I hope you plan on Hawking somebody that stuff and pay me back the money you owe me. What, she owes me money to! Kasey! I was gonna put it all back. Yeah, after we caught you. I have been trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Treat you well because you were down on your luck, but you haven't changed a bit. You're still the selfish little sister. We always take care of, who only cares about herself. We always do everything for you. You never had to work for anything. That's not fair, let me explain I believed you, when you joined our pack. How do you always had it so easy, you lived a privileged life, discovered at 18, you were an overnight success. You never had to work hard for anything. Maybe we should just keep looking for the deed. No, be quiet. Kasey, everything was handed to you on a silver platter and you always managed to ruin what was given to you. You do realize that everything that we're doing here is because of you. You spoke up at the funeral. When we were burying mom, you asked about money and now you're stealing from your own family, from your own mother, from us. You know what? I don't feel bad that you lost your career. You never earned it. - Aunt Kasey? - What? Were you really gonna put it back? The world is a vital place, Emily. So if you're gonna survive it, you need to be a little less innocent. You're not gonna get what you want by being so kind. You know, people who go after their dreams, lie and steal and cheat, that's life.

Well, I'm gonna call my lawyer. Good idea, I have a great one. You all are just gonna leave, are you? What about everything else that needs to get done around here? You're just gonna leave me to do it all by myself. It's all gonna charity, anyway. Let Mr. Shepard deal with it. Well, I'm gonna fight to keep my family home. Hey, I still live here. Do I still live here? Looks like it's time to move out. Hey? Kasey is gone. She took the jewelry. What are you doing? I'm going home. It's over, isn't it? What happened? Nothing, no, nothing happened. I just, I thought that Kasey and I were friends, but I'm just a dumb kid. you are not dumb. Aunt Kasey is acting dumb. She had an amazing person except her, regardless of her idiosyncrasies, she had to sabotage it. You are right, nobody's dumb, she's just sad. She is sad and little, she's human. No, no. I mean, she isn't happy. Well, she won't allow herself to be happy. She'd rather live her life alone than risk being alone later. That's damn. Yeah, system. The whole situation is ridiculous. Are you mad too? Of course, I am. Are you mad at Kasey or grandma? I'm just mad at myself. Listen, if you want my advice, you should reach out to her. Don't do what I did and just let her disappear. You should let her know how you feel. - Thanks mom. - You are welcome. Hello Kasey, it's your mother. I have something to read to you. There once was a farmer who planted seeds. Some of the seeds fell on a path, the birds ate them. These seeds are like those who hear the message of the Kingdom and don't understand it. Some seeds fell on rocky soil. The sun scorched them. These seeds are like those who hear God's message and receive it right away with joy, but as soon as problems come or they are tempted, they fall away. And still more seeds fell among the thorns. The weeds choked them out. These seeds are like those who hear God's word but they are overcome by worry and wealth. Finally, there were seeds which fell on rich soil. They took root and produced a crop. These seeds represent those who truly hear and understand God's word and produce a harvest in their lives. A well-watered garden. For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. ♪ I've become like you ♪ ♪ Oh oo oo ♪ ♪ In good and hard times ♪ ♪ Find you in my life ♪ ♪ Tell me patients. ♪ ♪ Show me where my truth is ♪ ♪ You care too much to loose this ♪ ♪ Gravity pulls me down down ♪ ♪ And now I see you didn't choose ♪ ♪ Oh, I've found the standing the light ♪ ♪ Oh, I dint fit in 'cause ♪ ♪ Forget that found the company like you ♪ ♪ Oh oo oo ♪ Wait ♪ Ah ♪ Wait, guys.

Team up, 30 minutes till the sun goes down. Okay, alright, that's. That's all of them. That's exactly how they were in the picture. At least content wise. Okay, what about the back? There wasn't anything written on the back? Yeah, that's all I got to see, definitely nothing there. It has to spell something. Sure. "Check"? Mum better not have hidden this in Eastern Europe. Wait if it's, "He" and CC, maybe like, he as God and CC as in emails, maybe? I think we're missing something. Wait, your shadow box, it had a B on it, right? Oh, you're right, yes.

Know you're gonna kind of close there. Nice work, Kasey. Now, the rest of you will officially sign later. What?! She included us. Well, it was time for a little payback. Alright, gather around you guys. I think your mother has one more thing she liked for me to read to you all. So, if you will indulge me. It doesn't matter whether you get everything or nothing. The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls who when he had found one Pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. Jesus is the merchant and you are His pearls. He gave up his life, so that you could spend eternity with Him. The greatest inheritance you can have is life with Him. I hope this adventure has served, illustrate what is truly important. Jesus tells us not to store up for yourself on earth, where moth and rust destroy but rather to store up for yourselves treasures in Heaven. Your talents are gifts to be used for His glory and your good. George, Rachel, Carrie and Kasey, you were my treasures. I put everything I could into sharing my faith with you. Go, do, be. And watch God multiply your treasures beyond your wildest imaginations.
