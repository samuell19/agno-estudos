Yes, that's John David Washington. Washington, right. How you think Mr. Washington got that part? -Showed up to an audition, did a good job-- -Audition. That's Denzel Washington's son, dude. He doesn't audition for anything. It's called nepotism. If you don't know anybody, then you don't get anything. [scoffs] You even know who your father is? Fuck you, fuck 12, fuck Hollywood. Get out there and protest, bro. Come on. Hey, the movie might not be good, but... shit, it'd be better if I was in it. [phone chimes] [upbeat jazz music] [traffic blaring] [phone chimes] [horn honking] [upbeat jazz music] [man] Yeah, obviously, I would've taken the chopper and all, but, I mean, all the seats were sold out. And, you know, with Kobe-- God damn, RIP to him-- it's just too soon, baby, it's just too soon. But fuck me, I can't wait to get out of this city. Yeah, the fuckin' protesters are all over the place, just marching around and shit. I mean, it's like, give it up already. You guys won, okay? You all matter. Oh, hold on, hold on, baby.

[soft mellow music] [traffic passing] [lighter clicks] ♪ Come to me, mama Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Come to me, mama Right now, right now, yeah ♪ ♪ Come on, baby ♪ Anybody ever tell you you're a cute guy, Gus? Eh, Jean-Michel, what's-- what the fuck, man? How you doing? Keep your distance. I haven't come this far-- I don't have to get sick from you. You know, Gus, if you had one of those masks on, you'd be a little safer. I'd be safer, but I wouldn't be as good looking. Because I'm trying to keep those tan lines off. So, Jean-Michel, you called, you said you got something you wanna show me? Right, right. Dude, I don't wanna touch that if it's hot. I don't wanna get my prints all over it. Are you outta your mind? Dee, da dee, dee, okay, let me see. Wait a minute. This can't be, man. This is... This can't be the thing that I read about. "Famed necklace stolen from Christie's during looting." Holy shit, "It was discovered on Monday that during the looting that took place over the weekend, the storage unit for the auction house Christie's was broken into and the items were stolen. Amongst the stolen items was a ruby necklace named The Evening Sun that was owned by Mary II that is valued at..." [no audible dialogue] -Three million bucks? -Shh! [music playing over radio] There's crazy-ass people around here. [nasally voice] Oh, yes, "Whoever stole this is going to have a terrifically difficult time selling." -Gus, come on, come on. -[normal voice] Wait! "A representative from Christie's said. The necklace is a museum"-- museum or museum-- "a museum piece." -[indistinct] Who cares? -"Its value lies in its craftsmanship and history. On top of that, we have notified--" this is the problem, "notified all dealers and museums to be on the lookout for this piece. We plan to get it back." I don't know. I think what you need to do is take it back to Christie's. I'm pretty sure they have "anonymous drop", they call it. They'll give you some kind of a reward. [Jean-Michel] I can't take it back to Christie's, all right, man. They're not gonna give me no reward. Just--just... -Hook me up with somebody... -All right, Just calm down. -Would you please calm down. -...who can give me some real money for it. Calm down. It's okay. Give me 24 hours. But, Gus, I'm trying to get outta town tonight. Give me 24 hours. I can't do this in a minute. Call me. You have my number? You got my number? Yeah, yeah, but I had to get rid of my phone. Listen, I'm gonna call you, but it might be an unknown number, all right? Unknown number's fine. I'll work on it. I will work on it for you. But you just keep yourself safe in the meantime. Answer your phone, Gus. Answer your phone. [upbeat music] [horns honking] [music playing over radio] [car horn honks] [Jean-Michel] Ma? Ma! -[soft piano music] -[mouthing words] Ma! -Oh, Jean-Michel! -[automated voice] Bluetooth paired. -What are you doing here? -[classical music blaring] -Oh God, you startled me. -I'm sorry, Ma. I was making some deliveries in the area. I wanted to come by, say hi. You don't have to wear that mask in here. It's okay. I got my antibodies, I'm fine. I know you're a superhero, but I don't wanna get you sick. I got my antibodies, I'm fine. Come here. Of course. I want you to take a look at this piece. I wanna get your opinion on it. Do you know what it is? No, I honestly have no idea, Ma. It's the Pope, calling me into the church. Yeah, yeah, I see it. I--uh, I see it. God never tires of forgiving us. We're the ones who tire of seeking His forgiveness. Sorry, Mom, what, what was that? Oh, ah! it's just something I've been thinking a lot about that the pope said. Hey, are you hungry? I'll make us some veggie burgers. No, no no, it's okay. It's okay, really. I'm getting outta town for a few days. I wanted to see you before I left. Oh. So I'm cooking something for us to eat. I'm not letting you leave here without a meal. Ma, you don't have to cook for me. And then you can tell me all about this trip you're about to go on. -You don't have to cook. -I said I'm cooking. Listen, son, I'm going away for a while, and I want you to take care of your mother, okay? I want you to know that the world you're gonna grow up in is a lot better than the one I grew up in. But there will be struggles. So you be strong. You be good. And you take care of your mother. I'm sorry, Pop. I mighta fucked up real big this time. [Jean-Michel exhaling] Hey, Ma, how's Clarice doing? Uh, I think she's okay. We--we don't talk a lot. You know, I think she's real stressed out about her job. But at least she's got one, right? Look, tell me about this trip you're about to go on. No no, it's okay. It's okay. I really just gotta go. There's this girl. I don't wanna be late. Is everything okay? You're acting a little jumpy. Everything's fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, really. -Um. -[stove top clicks] Could I borrow some money? Oh, so that's why you're here. Nope. Jean-Michel, I'm not giving you any money. You can just take your little girlfriend and go where you wanna go. You know what, Ma? I'm not doing this with you today. I'm a just gonna text you when I get upstate. Okay, but where are you headed?

So what worried you so much about what you saw in the government's actions yesterday? Kristof, what we witnessed yesterday out there was an unprecedented assault on our rights as peaceful protesters. I don't wanna watch videos. I've been lying around in my pajamas all day, and I have to get ready and go to work. You still acting, or what are you doing? Acting? There hasn't been any acting work for months. I also kinda got tired of playing the young Black waif, the prostitute, the go-go dancer, the sexy friend. Yeah, so I'm bartending now. Well, I thought all the bars were closed. Well we have a takeout window. What about you? You still acting? [chuckles] Nah, nah, it's like you said. Right, the whole industry is at a standstill. You still out in Brooklyn? Yeah. Yeah, for now. You know, I got all this back pay to take care of. Listen, would you wanna hang out with me after work? I think I get off at one, and you could come over here. I can't. [stammers] I can't. I got, I got something else to do later. Another girlfriend? No, no. Um. I'm getting outta town. Okay. Finally leave the city, you know. All right. I can't believe I never been out the country, you know. I gotta go. I gotta go to like Africa, or like Europe or something like that, right. Yeah. I wanna go to Paris. But first I gotta go to work. I gotta get ready. Are you sure you don't wanna come over later? Yeah. Yeah, no no, it's fine. Um, you know, speaking of... Shavinma, we really...

[Audrey] Mm. What's up? What's up? Did you forget we were spending time together today? Um, I tried to call you, but your phone keeps going straight to voicemail. [stammers] Oh, my phone is messed up. I, I had to get rid of it, you know. Why? I could tell you about that later. What's up? What you got going on? I'm, I'm shooting some press photos, maybe for this, you know, famous art, well, underground famous rapper. So I'm meeting him and his manager tonight for a drink. Oh, okay, underground famous rapper, who is it? Tyson Barrega. Ooh, Tyson Barrega, the alpha omega. Yeah yeah yeah, I know that cat. I got some of his songs on my phone, yeah. Well I had. Your phone that is gone now? Yeah, damn I gotta download... That's dope, that's dope. I'm sorry, that's dope. I mean, it's bittersweet because I was trying to spend some time with you today. Well, you're just gonna have to spend some time with me manana. Oh, manana, manana. I am sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be around manana. Oh, where you going? I don't know. Out west somewhere. Out west? Yeah. You can come with me if you want. [laughs] Go out west with you? Yeah. Come on, we've only been seeing each other a couple weeks. Yeah yeah yeah, but what a few weeks they've been, right? I mean, I been all right. You been, you been fuckin' great. [laughs] No, I'm serious, you can come with me if you want. Yeah yeah, I'll go away with you and we'll be just like Bonnie and Clyde. Yeah, yeah, except we gonna make it over in the car in the end, right? Car. I'mma go up and change. Mind if I, uh, come up and join you? Mmm, It's a mess up there. Come on, you know I don't care nothing about all of that. No, no, I, for real, it's, it's a mess.

[stammers] Don't worry about where I got it. Just, just come on, get in. Did you steal this car? I didn't--I didn't steal it, but--but--but, we should go. Put your seat belt on. We should go now. [engine gunning] So, where are you meeting Tyson Barrega and his manager? At the Great Lawn in Prospect Park. Okay, okay, that's a real romantic spot. Or practical, for social distancing. Mm. Of course, of course. So, are you gonna tell me whose car this is? -It's my car. -[laughs] Okay, bullshit. Bullshit. Who is Cary Grant Carroll? Is that you?

[upbeat classical piano music] [man] Audrey? Hello, good to meet you. -Hi. -I'm Josh, Tyson's manager. -Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. -Do that one, yeah. Hi. Actually, I'm not too concerned about, about the virus, so. Oh. Thank you for meeting me here. Just thought, you know, this was a good safe spot to meet. Plus, you know, any chance to be in the park. I love your look. It's like you walked in off a beach from some painting. Just like sauntered in. Thanks, I guess. It's just an old sundress. I like your shirt. Does it say "Alien"? Yeah, that's what I feel like I am, an alien. Like an alien trying to break apart the system. Now I got, I don't know, despite my cynical heart, I hope we're in the midst of like a great awakening. Do you know what I'm saying? Did you, uh, did you write that on there with Sharpie? Oh yeah. Yeah, it's a handmade original, worth some money someday. Today. Yeah, I think when we're forced to devote ourselves to scrap together a living, it's like we're incapable of understanding who we are. But we've all been unemployed, so we can all awaken. What did you do before quarantine? I'm a full-time manager. Is that a Patek Philippe watch? Yeah, it's an heirloom. Right. No, yeah, I guess, um, I guess we are asleep for decades and then everything crashes and we all wake up. [inhales] Let's hope we wake up. I think there's a lotta people still fucking asleep. It's like, wake up already, you know. Did you go to the protests? Uh, no, I mean it still seems kinda unsafe, right? I mean, I see them on social media, though, and like share a lot. You? Oh yeah, of course you have. I've been seeing your photos. They're amazing, like brilliant. Thanks. So, um... where is Tyson? I thought he was meeting us here. Oh, no. Come on, we're gonna go meet him at a party nearby. Don't worry, it's a rooftop party. Lots of fresh air. Okay. [soft jazz] [phone ringing] [sighs] -Hello? -Yo, Gus, Gus. -Jean-Mich-- -It's me. -Dude. -Hey, man, tell me some good news. Tell me you found somebody who wants to spend they money. Where are you? This sounds really weird. I'm at one of them, the Wi-Fi kiosks, you know. Hey, give me a second. Boom. Oh yeah, talk to me. Tell me what's going on. You sitting down? I got a deal. I can get $200,000. 200K? You said the shit was worth three million, nah? You know as well as I do, that thing is hot. And this woman, she basically is this rich heiress and all she really wants to do is keep it in her private collection. She can't show it to anybody. She kept saying that. I could never share it. I can never wear it. I can never share it. I can never wear it. You should be happy with that. I tried other places. That's the best I can do. All right. Okay, okay. Yeah, I gotta bring up something else. I want a cut. I want 25%. You're fucking killing me, man. 25%'s a good deal. It's probably what your agent and your manager would give you if they ever booked a job for you. -All right. -Otherwise you wouldn't be doing what you're doing. Fuck me, all right, all right. Gus, Gus, I get it, I get it. You a businessman, you gotta take your cut. Fine, whatever. I wanna meet you tomorrow night, seven o'clock, GW Bridge, southeast side. Little red lighthouse, you know where that is? Yeah, the little red lighthouse under the GWB. Right, the jeweler's gonna be there too, and he's gonna make sure that it's all, uh, copacetic. Hey, Gus, I gotta go. Jean-Michel, seriously, stay off the news. I gotta go, man. I'll talk to you later. Hello? He's on the run, man. I know what that's like. -[gentle music] -[traffic passing] [horn beeping] Jean-Michel, what are you doing? I'm tired. I wanna be alone. Audrey, I'm sorry. All right, I'm sorry, I just, I had nowhere else to go tonight. Jean-Michel, no one is supposed to be sleeping here, all right. I'm not even supposed to be sleeping here. Listen, please. All right, I'll be good. I'll sleep on the floor if I got to. Fine. You can come up, but we're sleeping. -I'm not in the mood. -Thank you. [keycode beeps] So, how'd it go with Tyson? I didn't even meet Tyson, just his douchebag manager. Douchebag, wha, he tried to hook up with you or something? This manager, he was gonna take me to a party where I'd meet Tyson, but Tyson wasn't even there, So... yeah, I don't know, probably. [soft saxophone music] -[door closes] -[Audrey sighing] [light clicking] Mm, oh, God. It's times like these that I wish I had a shower and not just this bucket. [traffic noises] God, I... I really hate this fuckin' city. I was just gonna say how much I love it, in spite of everything. [Jean-Michel chuckles] You know, if I could, I'd run away to a place where you could see the ocean. Somewhere you could get your food in the street. Somewhere you might be able to have a little bit of peace. That reminds me of this place I spent a couple weeks in, in Morocco. Yeah, I forgot you had the chance to go to Africa. Yeah. Happiest time of my life. I mean, definitely stressful, but... [takes deep breath] I learned more about myself there than anywhere else. For real? Yeah, I mean, that's where it all started. The birthplace, Africa. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's kinda different for you, right? Because you not Black. Yeah, I know I'm not Black. But it's where all humans came from, -the cradle of humanity. -Right, right. All, all humans. Uh. [chuckles] Yeah, no, I, I just hope I get to make it back one day. I thought you'd never been. I--I haven't. It's complicated. You know, it's in the blood. [Audrey] So... You gonna kiss me? Yes. But only... if you promise... next time you say please. [train passing] [upbeat jazz music] [horn beeping] [coffee pouring] [sirens blaring in distance] Jean-Michel? [gasps] Oh my... [Jean-Michel breathing hard] No, it's okay. It's okay, sorry. Sorry, I didn't... that's okay. [Jean-Michel breathing hard] I'm awake? [groans] I'm awake. I'm awake. It's okay. Here. Some coffee, not much but ... [sighs] Mm. I am awake. -Mm. -Sorry, yeah, that's, yeah, it's hot. It's okay. [laughs] It's okay. Remember when I first saw you? In that play last winter, before lockdown? You were so mesmerizing. I wanted to take your photograph so bad. Took a little while longer. But... Click, click, click. [laughs] Yeah, you got what you wanted. What are your plans for today? Nothing. I'm... going to Harlem at seven. I gotta meet up with this guy. If everything goes well, I'll be outta town tonight. If you want, you could come with me. We could drive away together. So, what are you doing today? What you got going on? I'm shooting Barrega at five. And then, um, I'm free. I was thinking of going to a protest. I was thinking that maybe, maybe, you might wanna drive out west with me. Go out west with you? I don't even know who you are. And I don't really know you, so... [Audrey sighs] Do you think we romanticize outlaws? You know, like, because they live more free. Like, they're not constrained by the rules the rest of society adheres to. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about Billy the Kid, I'm talking about Jesse James, I'm talking about Scarface. Like... why do we love criminals and killers and--and crooks? I don't know, maybe people just wish they didn't have to care, right? Maybe, maybe people wanna be like the Terminator. Right, [bad Schwarzenegger impression] ah, you take what you want. Ah, you don't care, ah! [normal] Living absolutely free. So people should be amoral? I ain't say that. Do you think that, do you think that morals are--are fluid? What do you mean? Like, do you think that our morals are set by when and where we were born, by our upbringing? What if, in another culture, killing someone because they own something that you wanted was totally acceptable? Like, I mean, eagles, they're fighting over scraps of meat all the time. Yeah, but we not animals, though, right? Okay, so which one is it? I don't know what you getting at, Audrey, but if you talking about racism in this country, it's wrong. It's always been wrong. Of course it's always wrong. That's not what I'm talking about. Look, [sighs] listen to this. Okay. "This is why the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose." Yeah, yeah, that's James Baldwin, right. So now you quoting James Baldwin to me. Just tell me what's going on, Audrey. I am trying to decide if I should run away with you or not, okay? I can't just drop everything and run away with you, even if I like you. Like me? [laughs] You like me? I tell you what, Audrey, I am so glad that you... like me. What's with the sarcasm? I love you, Audrey. I love you, and I wouldn't be sitting here asking you to come with me, if I didn't. I love you because you're special. Because you mean something to me. I mean, shoot, you're like the first white girl I ever fell in love with. Huh, I mean, if anybody found out about this back home, they wouldn't believe it. I'm gonna throw up. -White girl? -No, that's what I-- -White girl? -I didn't even mean it like that. Just a white girl, just a white girl. -That's not what I meant. -[Audrey speaking Spanish] I mean, one day, I really wish we could just like, see beyond race. [scoffs] This country is built on race, Audrey. You can't see past it. It comes through the pores. Well, maybe I'm an optimist. God, you know, when I was 12 years old, my father told me I couldn't marry a Black man? When I was about the same age, my mom said, don't end up with no white girl, she'll ruin your life. Man. [Audrey sighing] But they're still our parents. Yeah. And we... still got them, right? You got what you got. I got what I got. Everybody out there, they got whatever they working with. You know, we all got what we got, and we just trying to do the best we can with it, that's it. I just hate that the only thing people see is my whiteness. It's not the only thing I see. I'm serious. Hey, I... I see all of you. If I think about it, I think I seen about every inch of you. [Jean-Michel laughing] It's rude to point. Come on, I wanna take a picture of us. [gentle upbeat music] [Audrey] You got this. I have to see how it works. -♪ I know I can do it alone ♪ -[laughs] -♪ All on my own ♪ -Oh, okay. [camera beeps] I'm gonna look off again for this one. And you can look into camera. -Okay? -You're gonna look away? -Yeah. -Scared of me or something? No! Wow, these are really fuckin' good. You're brilliant. You're like a genius or something. I'm not a genius. This morning, while you were still sleeping, I took a look at the news, and the new Kristof video. Yeah, what'd you see? You're the cover of all the papers. Kristof dedicated his entire episode to you. Fuck, really? No, they are vilifying you, saying you're the face of everything wrong with the movement. Fuck, are you serious? That's not true. That's not it. Are you being for real with me? Look. Fuck it, is that my fuckin' headshot. White cop killed by Black man ignites debate and fury. What you... Get the fuck... He died? Yo, he fuckin'... he died? I wanna see the Kristof video. Good morning, everyone. Sorry about the eye. I did not sleep well. It's been kind of a rough night. Today, I had something completely different planned, you know, just check the calendar. You know what, don't look at that calendar too closely, because you know, then where would the surprises be? What I'm trying to say is I had a completely different show planned for today, but then, you know, whack, slapped in the face with a new catastrophe. But right, isn't that this whole year, right? You plan one thing and then, new catastrophe. New catastrophe. And what is today's new catastrophe, you're asking? You guessed it. Jean-Michel Coley. But you know what? We're not on lockdown anymore. And I don't wanna just talk to you about this myself, so let's go, come on. [upbeat music] I'm here with Rebecca Harvey and John Stanfield, two organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement here in Brooklyn. I imagine you guys saw the video, and just wanted to get your thoughts on Jean-Michel Coley. Just an hour ago, the president, you know, stated that this killing should completely discredit the entire movement. Look, I have no love for the president, but I do not condone violence either. Mr. Coley should not have shot this cop, and I worry that, I worry that this will set the entire movement back. Kristof, yes, Mr. Coley should not have shot the cop, but as you could see in the video, there is no sound. And we don't know if he was threatened or not. Now let me tell you something, as a Black man, we are taught to be submissive to the police so we won't wind up dead. Even if we are submissive to the police, we still wind up dead. I don't know, maybe Mr. Coley got tired of it or whatever. So do you think Jean-Michel Coley should turn himself in? -Yes. -Yes. Fuck this, fuck this. What did the president... No, no, I don't wanna know what he said. I don't care what he said. I don't fuckin' give a shit what he said. -What did he say? -He, he said that this proves that he was right and that the movement is dangerous and full of bad people, and that, you killing the cop is an attack on America and now, you're an enemy of the state. Yo, fuck him, fuck his hair, fuck his little fuckin' ties, fuck the KKK members he's related to. Why'd you do it? I just wanna try to understand. [Jean-Michel sighing] This young white dude left a briefcase right in front of me while I was working. You know he was wearing a suit, a fuckin' ascot, some shit like that. I figure it's an opportunity. I take the briefcase, I run down the alleyway, I look inside the briefcase, fuckin' necklace inside. It's a necklace with a ruby on it. I don't know how much the ruby is worth, I don't know how much the necklace is worth, but I know it's a lot because it's a gun right next to the motherfucker. Then a cop comes around the corner. But first I get to throw the gun in the trash, right, because you gotta be smart, you gotta be fuckin' smart. And the cop runs up behind me, he's like, yo, put your hands up on the wall, put your hands against the fuckin' wall or I'll fuckin' blow you away. He's fuckin' patting me down, got his hands up in my fuckin' junk and shit. Then he reaches inside my pocket, he pulls the necklace out. He's like, oh yeah, yeah yeah, this is too good for you. I'mma give this to my wife. A fucking crooked ass cop, talking about "I'm gonna light you up." Yo, Audrey, I made a move. I made a move because he... made a move. Fuck, man, I don't know. You have this necklace on you right now? Yeah. [soft music] Is this real? It almost looks fake. Oh, it's real. It's real. I think it's called the--The Evening Sun. It was at a jewelry store, Christie's, over by Fifth Avenue. They took it during the looting after the protests. It's worth like three mil. Uh. [laughs nervously] [Jean-Michel] Yeah. Nobody wanna touch it, though. It's a museum piece, so. Look, I know a guy who knows this heiress, and she's gonna buy it for like 200K. I'mma take the deal, and he gonna take $50,000 as a commission. I get to walk away with 150 large. It's enough to start... something. It's enough to start a life. I don't wanna have to do this alone. I can, if I got to, but yo, I really want you to come with me. I don't want you to do it alone. But I don't know, I'm scared. Right, right, nah, you're right, [stammers] because this is fucking crazy. Right, this is fucking crazy, because I killed this fucking cop, even though he was probably, he was probably gonna shoot me, but fuck it, right? This is fuckin' nuts. I just, just, just couldn't end up in jail. I couldn't do this. Listen, all right, just... Look, we don't have to go away forever, right? It's not till the end of time. I just... I just need a little bit of time. Then we can figure out how to make ends meet. We could, I don't know, find a job or open up a shop or something. [Audrey scoffing] What about acting? Acting? Shit, Audrey, I could do my thing anytime, anywhere, no matter what, as long as I got you. You know, I could, I could write books in exile, like, like Dostoevsky. Do you really think we can get away with this? Yeah, I mean, with the right amount of money in this world, you could do anything. Do you trust this guy that's selling it for you? Enough. Where are you meeting him? It's this little red lighthouse under the GWB. Okay. You get the money and I'll finish my shoot and I'll meet you and we'll go away together. For real? I don't know, maybe. I mean, New York's at a standstill. There's no work. I owe back rent on this studio. Maybe. Hey. Maybe's fine. [car honks] I'll take what I can get. [gentle upbeat music] [Audrey laughing] -[camera clicking] -What you doing? A bad Marcel Marceau impersonation. I don't think it's so bad. What time are you meeting Tyson and his manager? I think at five. You gotta get going, right? Yeah, probably. Don't you have to get going too? Yeah, yeah, I gotta, I gotta brush my teeth. Hey, hey, you can't go out there like that. What you mean? I mean, I'm not even supposed to be living here. Put on a shirt. And, hello? A mask. You right, you right, you right. [knocking on door] Make sure you follow my lead, okay? -Yeah, you got it. -♪ I'm good with numbers, ♪ ♪ haven't you heard? ♪ ♪ I have to control I have lost everything ♪ [song continues] [knocking on door] That was quick. Sorry, I thought I kept it unlocked. I thought you were the girl that paints down the hall. Can I help you? I'm Detective Roberts. This is Officer Ryan. You Audrey Lasko? Yes, I am. Believe you had a relationship with this guy? Or that he's here right now? Excuse me, you can't fucking barge in here like that! And wear goddamn masks. Yes, Jean-Michel and I had a fling a few weeks ago. I've seen his face all over the news. He killed a cop, right? -Yeah. -Look, I don't know what to tell you. I haven't seen or heard from him in weeks. I have a photo shoot I have to get ready for in an hour, so unless you two have a warrant, I'm gonna kindly ask you to leave. This chick must watch a lotta procedurals. Don't call me a chick. [Ryan] Are you supposed to be living here? I don't think you're allowed to be living in these stu... I think we're gonna find out pretty quickly if Miss Lasko's lying or not. All we have to do is go to your super and get access to those tapes. Do you have the super's number, ma'am? Sorry, I don't. Audrey, you do know that withholding evidence is a felony? You can go to jail for it. Pretty girl like you, upstate. They'll mess you up. We'll be in touch. Let's go. [Audrey sighing] [song continues] This is Detective Roberts of the NYPD. How you doing today? Listen, I'm gonna need some... I'm gonna need some footage from you, from the building. We got reason to believe that um... [light upbeat music] [gentle music] [traffic passing] [indistinct banging] [banging continues] "What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Does it fester like a sore? And run? Does it smell like rotten meat, or does it crust, sugar over, like a syrupy sweet?" Sweet, sweet. [laughs] "Does it, does it sag like a heavy load? Or... [bangs foot] does it explode?" Jean-Michel, what the hell are you doing here? The whole city is looking for you. Hey, Blake. I figured you'd be here, man. I just wanted to come by, see you. See this space before I... before I got out the city. Well you, you not gonna call the cops on me, right? No, I'm not gonna call the cops on you, but you know, seeing your face across the TV, you know it's got me fucked up, right? I mean, I can't believe it. Sounds like you shot that cop in cold blood. Blake, it wasn't like that. All right, I was scared. I didn't wanna die. I don't wanna go to jail. We all get scared, but we have to fight that fear. If you're scared, then you're foolish. And if you're foolish, then you're a goner. Yeah, yeah, naw, I know. I know. Your mother must be torn up. Have you seen her? Have you thought about her? Yeah, yeah, I saw her a little while ago, but that was before all the news hit. Yo, if you trying to make me feel bad, I already feel as bad as I can, so... Jean, I'm not trying to get you to do anything. Blake... I just wanted to say hi. And--And tell you that, you know, this theater saved my life. Look, I know things are heated right now. I don't like the cops myself. I nearly got beaten up at a protest about a week ago. But you're putting out fire with gasoline. I want to defend you, but what you did was wrong. You fucked up, and you're talented too. And you fucked that up as well, too. [shrugs] You need to do the right thing and turn yourself in. It'll help all of us. It'll help the movement. Nah, yo, I can't do that. I can't go to jail, I... Shit, would you? Then you need to get as far away as you can from here. To another country. [door closing] [woman] Blake? You need to go. Leave through the rear, I'll stall her. I'm here. I'm already here. [woman] Were you talking to somebody? No no no, I was working on a monologue. You know, I used to be a great actor myself. I still am. Like, she forced me to turn my camera off while I was having a massive freakout. -Ah. -Oh, she called you out. [group chattering] She called you all the way out. -[laughter] -Don't do that to me. Don't be doin' that to me. Oh my gosh, yo, it's Jean-Michael Coley. Ooh. Oh, it's the Jean-Michael Coley. You're my fuckin' hero. You are my hero. Don't say that. Just chill, Just y'all-- -The way you shot, bow! -[laughter] Just keep it down. Keep it down, all right. Let's take a picture. Come on, come on. One picture. One picture. -Just one? -Nah, nah, I'm good. Take multiple. Just make sure y'all wait to post this like three to five business days, please. Okay. Oh my God, so good. I got 'em, I got 'em. All right. Hey, y'all listen, all right. Don't go out and do what I did. What? It was wrong. It was wrong. Fuck the police, man. Fuck them. And, and, and they wrong too. They wrong too. But what I did was wrong too. All right, don't kill no cops. Don't kill nobody. -Fuck that. -That's some bullshit. Aren't they people too? -Right. -[group laughing] Yo, white lives matter. [laughing] Life is about living. The world don't need that shit right now, all right. Y'all stay up. Y'all stay safe. Where you going? Wait, wait. Wait to post them pictures, all right. No, bro, whoa. Until when? [incoherent hectoring] -Show me the pictures. -Where are you going? Wait, let me see. [upbeat music] Hi. Hey, and so we meet again. You look lovely once again. Thanks. I'm so sorry about the other night, but, uh, my man is here today. Tyson, this is Audrey, the photographer. -Hi. -Hi, Audrey, I'm Tyson Barrega. Nice to meet you. Yeah, we'll do the elbow. We can do the double. Yeah, I don't know why. I like the double. Sorry I didn't make it to your event last night. I was actually at another event. Got a little high, toking it up, -lost track of time. -[Audrey laughs] But you know. So what do you have in mind for the shoot? I was thinking maybe we would start on this playground. You know, just like, a kid in the neighborhood, super casual, nothing crazy. All right, I'm feeling that. Does that feel good? Yeah, but do you think we'll be needing Josh here? No, I think we're good. Yeah, I mean... Well, all right then my dude [indistinct] I love this with the crown and the lion earring. -Like a wild thing. -Yes, yes! -All right, let's do this. -[Audrey] Very cute. Ooh, yeah, I love the arms up. [Tyson] Mm-hm. [camera clicking] Gorgeous. So you grew up in the Bronx? I did, born and raised. How's your summer been? Better than expected, actually. I mean, all the rich white folks are gone. Oh yeah. No tourists. Folks are in the street fighting for justice and freedom and love. It's been great actually. Are you nervous about the fall? Like the fall season, or the fall of society? [laughs] The fall season. Like, are you nervous about a second wave or the elections? I think I'm worried about both. Think I'm worried about it all. Feel like I've been living in this fuckin' bubble, yo. Like this city sure ain't this country. That is for damn sure. It's another world once you get out the city. I don't know, I don't feel afraid like when I'm in Paris, but I feel afraid in Oklahoma. It's like the guests on Kristof's show said. This country's still in the middle of a Civil War. You watch Kristof? Don't we all watch Kristof? I know him. If you ever wanna take some pics with him, let me know. Oh, yeah, I could, I probably will take you up on that. -Word. -I'm just gonna switch to the digital, because I just ran out of film. So, where are you from? I'm from Miami. Ooh, I love Miami. Beach vibes. I love the arts. I love the people. And why'd you come to New York? Um... You know, I think, think I had big dreams you know, and Miami just got a little, a little too small. My mom died, and I saved up a bunch of money and bought my one-way ticket here. [camera clicking] A girl of action. Boom, boom, boom. -[Audrey laughs] -I like that. I don't know about all that. You ever see this short film by Michel Gondry? About a guy who has a camera for a head and he keeps bumping into everything. It's kind of how I feel. Nope, no fuckin' idea what you're talking about. [Audrey laughing] But I do know, if you wanna be free, you just gotta be free. You just gotta take that jump, just get out there and be free. I don't know. I just believe in love. Erotic love, romantic love, love for your brothers and sisters. Otherwise, what else is there? -[camera clicking] -You just die, figuratively. You got someone special? You got a lover? Um, yeah. I think so. You think? [laughs] I have my hesitations. Fuck that! [Audrey laughing] If you love somebody, you just gotta love them. You just gotta take that plunge. I mean, what if you died? You just got Corona next week and just died, boom. What are you gonna do? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. You wanna take a look? These are actually looking really good. -Let me see, let me see, let me see. -[stammers] Let me show you. Ooh, I'm a fuckin' king. -Yes. -Yes. And, I think there's some narc motherfucker over there looking at us now. Oh, fuck, that's a cop that's following me. Do you mind distracting him? Not at all. I got you, I got you. I think I'm gonna go see about that boy. -Okay. -Okay. Okay, take that plunge, girl. Officer? Officer, are you an officer? Officer, are you an officer? Officer, excuse me, Officer. I mean, you ain't gonna tell me nothing about that grease you got up in your hair? [soft blues music] Jean-Michel, what's happening, man? Is that like a vacuum cleaner or something? Dude, you're getting famous all of a sudden since I last saw you. [laughs] Hey, keep it low-key, huh? Keep it low-key. Yeah, right. Listen, what's the deal? You, uh-- Come over here. Let me talk to you for a second. So, I thought you said that the heiress was the one who was gonna be buying the necklace. What's up? -That's right. -So what's up with this dude? That's Franchini. He's a jeweler. He's gonna check it out, make sure it's authentic. So you got me here under a bridge in a strange place, a new fuckin' face, just to get it checked out? Hey, what is the deal? What's going on there? Is there a problem? No, there's no problem. No problem, no problem. Okay, so let's see this necklace then. Come on, over here by this rock. Okay, give it to me. I need to take a sample of the metal. Is it okay if I make a tiny scratch on part of the necklace? Yeah, do what you gotta do, man. This is real. The gold is good, and the ruby is good. But I wanna check a few things just to make sure it's the actual Evening Sun. I'm gonna take a couple photo, okay? Hey, do what you gotta do. Just be quick about it, all right? I know we gotta be cool and shit, Gus, but all I'm saying is we really out here in the open. We out here, out here. We real conspicuous right now. This is New York. No one cares. I could be doing this out here naked, and no one would care. So what's up? We good? I need to take a look at it. Soon as I get in front of a computer. I need about 15 minutes. Shall I call you when I know? Nah, no no no, we, we gonna go with you. You know, my uncle was a cop. Yeah, what the fuck is that supposed to mean? It means I need this job because I need a job right now. And I'm a professional. That doesn't mean I like you. Franchini, I told you I'd vouch for this guy. Whatever you've seen on television, I'm telling you he's a good guy. And, Franchini, I know you need the money. All right, you can come with me to my office. But, you wait outside while I verify the necklace. All right, fine. So let's go. Andiamo. Hey, bro, you're gonna follow us, right? Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah. Um... You know, I was waiting for somebody, but I'll be right behind you. All right. So listen, I know you don't have your phone, so stay close. -Come on. -Yeah, I got you. I got you, I'll be right there. -Right behind you. -Cool, cool cool. [Gus] All right. He's waiting for somebody. [car door closes] [romantic music] Miche! Miche! Audrey! Oh my God. -I love you. -We have to go. We gotta go. I love you too. We gotta go. We gotta go. I'mma take your bag. I'mma take your bag. We going. We going. I'mma take the keys. You driving, all right. Its' better, It's better, trust me. -I'm driving. Okay. -We gone, we out we out, let's go. [Audrey] Which one is it? [Jean-Michel] Quick, quickly. [engine starting] [horn beeps] Yo, you can, you can follow that black SUV up there. So, did you sell it? No, no, it's not that easy. The heiress had her jewel man come, and now he's taking pictures and double-checking on the internet, making sure that's The Evening Sun. It is The Evening Sun, but he's gotta make sure that things are good on his end so that we can get outta here, hopefully tonight. How did things go with Tyson? Good, he told me to seize love because it's all we got. [laughs] Nice. Nice. And? I'm good. You're good? So you--you got me? I got you. [chuckles] All right, all right. I might have fucked up, but you got me so we gonna be all right, right? Does this car have a stereo? Yeah. [upbeat music] [reporter] And in other news, the search continues for Jean-Michel Coley as the shooting of a white officer by an African American man continues to cause reverberations through a city and a country already in the midst of a major reckoning on race. Some prominent Black leaders have called for Jean-Michel Coley to turn himself in, while the NYPD union leader, Franco Smith, has declared that this killing shows that the vilification of the NYPD has gone too far. [radio clicks off] [Jean-Michel] All right. You know, I didn't even mean to--to do all that. May--maybe, maybe I should just, you know, turn myself in. No, you're not turning yourself in, Jean-Michel. I just don't wanna take away from the movement, you know. What you did wasn't right, but the system is fucked and it's rigged, against you. You fucked up in a fucked up world, so... you run. Yeah, but two wrongs ain't never made a right. You know, and I, I... Who knows? It's bigger than me now. I gotta think about the movement. I gotta think about my family. [soft music] Yeah, just, just pull up right here. I think, I think this is it. Franchini and I [mumbles] be right out. It'll take maybe 15, 15 minutes. 15 minutes, Gus. You say 15 minutes, I believe you. You the man. I'm the man. You gonna come through this time, right? Yeah. -Watch me. -[Jean-Michel] Yeah. [exhaling] Uh, I think I'm gonna go into, uh, bodega, get something, to eat, or just stretch my legs. I don't know, you need anything? Are you sure it's safe for you to go out. Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine. [stammers] It's right there. I'll be good. Okay. Jean-Michel? Shavinma, hey. Damn, you the most famous brother in New York right now. Yeah, but, you know, it's not really like that. Why didn't you tell me? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna run. I'm getting outta town. Hey, um, matter of fact, could you, could you tell my moms that everything'll be all right? Okay. You think, um, you think I'm making the right choice running away? You should definitely run. Do not turn yourself in. Okay. Yeah. Jean-Michel? Be careful. Be safe. Who is she? That girl you were talking to. Oh, that's, that's Shavinma. She lives upstairs from my mom. Why is she looking at me like that? -We used to date. -[mouthing words] Did she just say White girl? No, no. No, no. [scoffs] She said, she said, she said "why, girl?" Yeah, wh-why. Why you with him? Hey, Franchini said it's legit. Of course he said it's legit. It's legit. [Gus] Yeah. So what's up? What's next? The heiress is gonna send the money over to him tonight. I'll get it, bring it over tomorrow, the deal'll be complete. Whoa whoa whoa, wait, tomorrow? Best I could do, sorry. Fine, fine, Gus, fine, it's fine. You don't have a place to stay tonight, do you? Brooklyn, 101 Johnson Street, Number 209. It's a cyc studio I help my brother run. And uh, the heiress, she's tough. Franchini, they just want me to do it. They want me to hold onto the necklace. [sighs] Gus, are you serious? I'm serious, but what I'm asking you, is it cool? Because if it isn't, I will tell them to fuck off, and you could have it. But I really think we oughta follow their lead. Yeah, yeah, Gus. You know, uh, you know, you know I trust you, right? -[Gus] Okay. -[Jean-Michael] You be safe. [Gus] You be safe. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. -Fucking tomorrow. -[upbeat jazz piano music] [Audrey] I think I've shot in this building before. [Jean-Michel] Hm. Yeah? [Audrey] Yeah. He said 209, right? Yeah, yeah, but how can you tell? None of these doors got any numbers on them. Audrey? Audrey, is that you? -[Audrey] Oh shit. -Oh my God, it is you. Ha, Mark. Air kiss, mwah, air kiss, mwah. Oh my God, what are you doing here? You don't have a shoot right now at like 11 at night. Tell me, tell me, how have you been surviving the summer? Weirdest summer ever, am I right? Hi, I'm so rude. Hello, I'm Mark. Uh, Booth. Booth, weird name, but okay, elbow handshake. Ah. I'm all right, thank you. So tell me, tell me. So yeah, we are shooting some publicity shots for him, because he's dropping a single tomorrow, and this magazine just asked for a couple shots and we found this place. What about you? What are you doing here? This is where my studio is. It's right around there. Just some late-night painting. I've always been my best in the middle of the night. Hm. Do you know where 209 is? Oh, Just around there, to the left, one door down. Great, thank you so much. Yeah, oh my God, great catching up. You should come by when you two are done. I've got a jug of spicy margaritas in my fridge. [door closing] Oh, nice. Wow, huh. This space is really fuckin' dope. [laughs] Is this where y'all take your pictures and all that stuff? [Audrey] Mm-hm. Yeah. [Audrey] Oh, man. Do you think it was crazy that I gave Gus the necklace? Like, like, like, you know, he probably gonna do what he's supposed to do, but as soon as you trust somebody, they... Chill, you're good. You trust him, right? Yeah, yeah, you right. You right. And then tomorrow you're gonna get the money in the morning, right? Tomorrow morning. [Audrey sighing] I mean, I don't see why not, right? [chuckles] I mean, this, this heiress, she wants the necklace real bad, and she getting it for sale, so. You scared? Running away? No. Nah, n... No. You? Yeah. You know what I'm really scared of? What? You know, the news, politicians, everybody got an opinion. Nobody... wants to talk to me. People wanna vilify me. People wanna call me a hero. I just don't wanna leave without saying my piece. I just wanna tell people what I'm thinking. Well, what are you thinking? [chuckles] I, I, I don't fuckin' know. I don't fuckin' know. What if we... what if we could get you on Kristof's show? You know, like a, like a Kristof exclusive, so you could tell your side of the story. Yeah, I mean, that, that would be perfect. But, but he's like famous, famous. He got like 30,000 DMs right now. I don't even know him. Tyson Barrega knows him. He said he could connect me. Okay, I'm gonna try, why don't I try? Let me, let me just try. Okay, I'm gonna call him on WhatsApp, because I--I think that's harder to trace. Hey, Tyson. Hey, yeah, it's Audrey. No I'm good, I'm good. Um, remember how you were saying you could get me in contact with Kristof? Yeah, I was wondering if you could give me his contact? I'm with Jean-Michel Coley and... No, it's not like that, but he would like to do an exclusive on Kristof's show. Oh, okay. Cool, yeah yeah yeah, I got it. Thank you, thank you. Okay. Calling Kristof. Hello? Hi, this is Audrey Lasko. No, yeah. You don't know me. I'm a photographer. Tyson Barrega gave me your number. Yeah, hi. Um... I'm with Jean-Michel Coley right now. No, still at large. And, he is actually probably going to be disappearing more permanently tomorrow. And he'd like to do an interview on your show to tell the public his side of the story regarding the shooting. Would you be interested in an interview? Yeah, of course, it would be remote. Yeah, we have Wi-Fi here. Okay, cool, uh, we will set up. Thank you. Kristof will interview you on his show in an hour. Are you fuckin' serious? I, I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna say. [Audrey] I'mma set up some lights. Oh, that looks good. Thank you. Oh, wow, you really did your thing with these lights. I am a professional. I know this. Ready? [soft piano music] Hello, Jean-Michel Coley, I'm Kristof. -Welcome to my show. -Hey, Kristof, good to meet you. I'm a big fan. Well, thank you for watching. It's always nice to meet a fan. Yeah, no, I got a ton of respect for what you do. It takes a lot to go out every day, you know, it's intense. Yeah, and it's, it's tiring. Uh... But I can't stop myself. It's like, it's like some sickness inside me. I feel you, I feel you. It's like a fire in your belly or something, right? Well, thank you for joining me and giving me this exclusive. All right, so how do you wanna do this? Do you wanna just tell me your side of the story? Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good. Look, I know what I did was wrong. It's not like I don't have morals or something like that. I just reacted impetuously. Impulsively. Because I thought I was gonna die. That cop said that he was gonna light me up. It's the same shit they said to Sandra Bland before she got murdered. And, and, and I know if you go back and look at the video, you could see that I tried to help him, right? I tried, but he pushed me away. He pushed me away me, he fuckin' spit at me. He called me... The officer in question didn't want my help. You know, Kristof, you ever, you ever been stopped while you was driving? No, no reason at all. You ever been followed in a grocery store while you was picking up your almond milk? I think I've actually never been pulled over while driving. [chuckles] Never? You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. I don't even wanna talk about it anymore, man. You ain't even fully like white white, right? Shit. Listen, I--I snapped. I was tired. And I fuckin' snapped. So if you know what you did was wrong, are you planning to turn yourself in? No. No, no no. I mean my--my--my pops died in jail. I ca... I can't. Did you ever read Crime and Punishment? By Dostoevsky? Yeah, I read it, but, you know, it's been a minute. Yeah, I been thinking a lot about the dude in that book. Now Dostoevsky writes that the man with a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his own sin. And that's his punishment, and his prison. So you're saying that you're in your own prison right now? Yeah. [laughs] Ay, metaphorically speaking, we all are, right. Nah, I just, I get to take mine with me. I'll tell you this, though. I ain't gonna end up in one of them physical ones. They're gonna have to put me in a box first. [camera clicks] [floorboards creek] [Audrey groaning] You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. You sure you're okay? You seem a little off. Nah, I'm all right. I'm all right. Um... You know, a little tired. [chuckles] Feel kinda bad for dragging you into all of this. You don't have to come if you don't want to. I told you I want to. You know, you kinda crazy. You know that? [laughs] But for real, I could turn myself in. I could go to jail. I could... get three hots and a cot, and some peace and quiet, if I fight for it. [laughs] What are you talking about? [sighs] It's nothing. It's nothing. Come on, come on. Let's wrestle. I don't feel, I don't feel like wrestling. -Let's go. -Hey, ho. Come on. [grunts] Oh, oh, okay, all right, here we go. [Audrey shrieking] I am supreme! [hard knocking] Hey, that must be Gus. See, we're gonna be okay. Miche. Yo, Gus. Come in, come on, come on. [soft jazz music] So, -this is it. -Yeah? This is the money. I already took my cut, so it's all yours. Holy shit, Gus. Gus, you really did it, man. -Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, I did. -Fuck. You really fuckin' did it. Gus, man, thank you. Thank you. Ah, I guess we all good, right? All good. [Audrey mumbles] [Gus] Don't know why I did that. [Audrey] You okay? [Gus] I'm okay. I'm good, I'm good. [knocking on door] [Mark] Audrey? [Gus] Who's that? [Mark] Audrey? Audrey, you there? [Audrey] It's this artist I know who has a studio on the floor. I'll handle it. I'll handle it. -What's up, Mark? -I thought you'd still be here. Uh, I need to speak with you. Oh boy. What's up, Mark? Yeah, I racked my mind all night, and then it hit me. That guy you were with, I know who he is. He's Jean-Michel Coley, the cop killer. The murderer. No, it's not. He's a singer. Don't lie to me. I looked him up, I studied his photos. In spite of the mask, I never forget someone's eyes. I know it's him, honey. Mark, what did you do? You called the cops, didn't you? It's for your own good. Oh, you fucking... [groans] He's dangerous. I'm sure he's just using you. You don't even know anything about him. -Fucking annihilate you. -[fist striking] Oh my God, my nose. You bitch! [soft jazz music] [door opens and closes] Shit, shit, shit, he called the cops. We gotta get outta here. What the fuck you mean he called the cops? I thought you said he was cool! I thought he was, but he definitely isn't! What the fuck? -[Audrey] Come on. -[sirens blaring in distance] All right, the money's in this bag. You, you, you grab your camera bag. [Audrey] Let's go, let's go. Let's go. [upbeat jazz music] [sirens blaring in distance] -Wait, I need to tie my shoes. -Yeah, go ahead. Hold on, I need to tie my shoes. Get the keys in the, in the bag, it's the front pocket. -[sirens blaring] -Freeze, NYPD! [Jean-Michel mumbles] Okay, okay. Let's go. -[Audrey] Shit! Shit! -[man shouting] -[engine racing] -[Audrey] Shit! -[tires squealing] -[shots fired] [indistinct] Something's wrong with the car. [Jean-Michel] Girl, we gotta go. We gotta go. Jean-Michel, Audrey, freeze! We don't wanna shoot! Fuck, I can't get a fuckin' angle on them. Is that the only fuckin' word you know? Shit, fuck! [Roberts] Stop, goddammit. [Audrey] Shit. Fuck, eight minutes, eight minutes. [Audrey] What do we do? Did we lose them? I think so. I don't see nobody. Oh my fucking God. [groans] Babe, you know you a little bit of a bad-ass, right? [laughs] Baby, I can literally throw up right now. Throw up? [mumbles] You musta been like track superstar or some shit like that in high school. [laughing] Yeah. We gonna be all right. What's next? What do we do next? We gotta figure out how the fuck we gonna get outta here. How the fuck do we get outta here? Shit. Shit. Hey, yo, isn't that... Wait, I think I have an app for that. The Revolt shit, like the scooter? [police] Freeze! Fuck, fuck, fuck. -[gun firing] -[Audrey] Fuck! [Jean-Michel] Baby! -What are you doing? -What the fuck, man? -What are you doing? -He's the fuckin' cop killer! Shut up! Baby, baby, can you walk? No. [Ryan] I blew my fuckin' load. You got another clip? We gotta get outta here. We gotta fuckin' go right now. Jean-Michel, Audrey, you don't have to do this! Turn yourselves in. [Jean-Michel groaning] [Ryan] Okay, shoot him. Just fuckin' shoot him! He's right there! He's a fuckin' cop killer. Pull the trigger. -Pull the fuckin' trigger! -[scooter starts] What are you waiting for? Get off me. Get off me! I'm making sure you do fucking desk duty for the rest of your fucking career. You're gonna get written up for this! -Me? -Yeah, you! I'm reporting you! [sirens blaring in distance] You don't fuckin' deserve that fuckin' badge. ["Rhapsody in Blue" plays] -[leaves rustling] -[electronic whirring and beep] [camera clicking] [birds squawking] [gentle music] [lips smacking] Hey. How'd it go? It was good. I think I got a couple good photos. Ah, that's good. Good is always good, right? How's the editing? It's actually almost done. Exciting. That was fast. Yeah, yeah, I got this fire in my belly right now. Or this sickness. You, uh... are you feeling okay? I can't do this anymore. This is... all too lonely. Lonely, Audrey, I'm right here. I been here this whole-- But I miss everything. And you've... been distant. [birds chirping] I'm leaving. -I'm sorry. -Don't apologize for what you're feeling, all right. Uh, I get it. I get it, you know. You gotta do you, and this, I guess this ain't you. Ah, shit, it was never your fight anyway. [Audrey sighing] Are you leaving today? No. Tomorrow. Mm.
