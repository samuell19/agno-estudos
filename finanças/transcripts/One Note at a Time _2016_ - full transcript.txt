I used my drum just to hold in front to kick. And I floated to a higher ground. -When Katrina came, I was playing outside there with a four-piece overture and the man come out. He switched off the fan. And I said don't switch the fan, what the hell's the matter with you. It's hot as Hades. It was a day like this. And he said ain't you heard? The hurricane's changed course, it's coming right up the river. So, I'm low, wow, I'll be damned. Go out fellows. Pack, the weatherman said get the hell on away from here. So there was three men in that band besides me and it took me almost a year, took me 11 months and a week to find all of those three was still alive. -This painting is a rendition depicting Merci Ray Nagin. And he was the mayor that experienced the devastation and the chaos and the turmoil and the helicopters that flew at night in search of victims. Katrina was not the problem. It was when the levees were defeated. It was a man-made incident. 1,800 people died that was documented. And plus they have other people that were undocumented that are still warehoused now that has not been identified. -Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? And like this guy here. He's got a nice yard, got a nice pool. Never speak to me. His kids speak, his wife, but we ain't speak. I could be out doing yard and he'll never say a word and the day before the storm, he told me say, hey, man, what you and the wife gonna do? He stopped and spoke to me, I was shocked. I said we splitting. Hey, you welcome to come and stay over here, we got an upstairs. I said man, I'm not staying back here from the storm, man. I don't care if I had five floors. I said I'm not saying back here. He said well, you're welcome. I said the first time you gonna speak to me, you know. I said no, man, uh-uh, you could stay back here. He stayed, boy, he wish he never done it. Buddy of mine stay over there, he was stuck on his roof for like three days, you know. -When the water start rising, a door that I can normally open with my finger, I couldn't open with all of my might just I mean I just got so exhausted trying to get the door open. And I had about a terabyte of hard drive with hundreds of songs that I had spent countless of hours recording and mixing and producing. So my head was just pounding once I realized that it was gone. -My older son had a whole lot of equipment, you know, at his house and that got flooded and ruined everything. And he had to move up to West Virginia. And I think that because of the storm, he passed away because of what he lost, you know. My second son, second oldest son died almost the same way. -I mean a lot of musicians that is from New Orleans can't get back. They have no way to get back and nowhere to go home to. I've seen guys places like Baltimore, Maryland to all over this country. I saw somebody in New Mexico recently and they were saying about I can't get used to living in this desert. Or the ones that be in places like they don't, they older guys and they not used to being in the cold. Some of them are just, they don't know how to talk to people there. -When I came back, no music, no birds, no bees, no tearing, no nothing and that is why I put all the junk out that I did and now that I decided to, you know, support music, I support music all the way and I didn't realize that until I got to Houston, Texas and I found out that it's not the same, you know. Nobody really cares about music, they don't care about talking to come in, they go in the house. And see like now I decided that I would try and let people know that hey, this is New Orleans. Ain't nothing like New Orleans and we love music. WWKFM New Orleans. It's beautiful music, amazing music. -So this is where we come to get cured. -I don't know what I would have done without it. Probably wouldn't have done anything, but died. -The Musicians Clinic is an access to healthcare. We offer primary care and also preventative services and specialist referrals. We have a very full market basket of medical services to help musicians who never have insurance. -The thing that will bring them into the clinic is they can't play the horn because they have an abscess in their tooth. But in the course of diagnosing the abscess, we find that they have diabetes, they have asthma and many times they have hypertension. We have healthcare statistics that rival third world countries. And so to me, when one member of a band who've played together for 30 years is risking death because he is not taking his medication so he doesn't have a stroke, that's a blow to our culture. This is a portrait of my ancestor and it used to hang up over my parents' fireplace when I was growing up in Mississippi. And the poignant thing about this portrait is that it was painted a few weeks before my ancestor and his son and 11 other members of our family were killed at the resort they owned on one of the barrier islands, called Il Denier. And I actually wear this gold coin around my neck that he gave to his baby daughter right before he left and it's really one of the few things that we have left from him. Because they'd had a big dance that night with an orchestra and then tidal wave and hurricane hit and over 300 people were killed. And it always struck me that they knew the names of the slaves because they were property, but they never documented what happened to the musicians. We don't know their names, we don't know where they came from and it always stuck with me. -I grew up in New York City, went to a very exclusive private school, next to the Guggenheim Museum, watched them build the Guggenheim Museum and everyone else's family were business people, lawyers and business people and politicians and I was there on a scholarship as their token artist child. We were very different and everyone was very envious because I could go home on my own. There wasn't a limousine waiting for me. But growing up in an artist's household was very, very different from what was usually seen in America. And that gave me the background to understand what the need was for a musician's clinic, that artists are not thinking in that direction, that they're using a different part of their brain and if you want to talk bad about them, which some people do, oh, they're druggies and irresponsible individuals. Tell me what symphony you've written today, sir. -It was a blessing to come home and watch people work all day. They may come to the little bars at night and hear us play and kind forget for that time, it's like spiritual healing. I mean I felt it, I know they felt it and that's going on till today. I mean you wouldn't believe`. -I came to New Orleans, I was playing rock and roll, so I had to learn how to play R&B. And once I got into it, I started gigging and it was great. I bought a BMW motorcycle and in August 2008, a lady came flying around the curb and hit me and that's how I ended up with a prosthetic leg. When I had the accident, people that I thought hated me actually showed up and the people that I thought loved me so much never sent a card or called me, it's weird. And I got a sense of humility at that time. Getting back into music has been tougher than I thought. The long hours of being on stage. My stage diving days are over, put it that way. But it hurts, I can actually still play guitar though. I'm not gonna complain. I'm glad to be alive actually. Had the accident, woke up in the hospital four days later. Paralyzed from the neck down. I never really think about it. I'm getting choked up, you know. I knew life was changing. I knew it was bad. I remember the day the doctor said, Paul listen, we've done 11 surgeries and he said we can keep shooting you up with antibiotics and keep sucking the pus out. Paul Patton? -Yes, but if it gets more infected we're gonna have to end up cutting off your whole leg and I said take it off and that was that. -I had spent maybe 15 years working with the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation, which produces the Jazz Festival. And we never could tackle medical issues because they're so expensive. One heart attack is a bill of $50,000. Foundations don't have that kind of money. So I realized that if we could bring it into inside a medical center and get the services donated, then it becomes possible to help people. -They saved my life four or five times. And I don't know what I would have done with this organization. Presently, I'm working at Preservation Hall. I had two bands of my own, but since Katrina, the members have been spread out all over the country, so I haven't been working any of my bands. Today I'm gonna have fish. Whatever I have for dinner, I eat for breakfast. -I was born, you probably can tell, in England and they used to have block parties there. And it would always impress the girls if you came with records of all the local favorites and I went to my local music store at a place called Stains. I said you got any records here? Yeah, we just got one. Here, this was Louis Armstrong. And when I took there and played it, all the girls there, they were into pop music, they laughed at it, but I thought it was great. So I said to hell with the girls, I'll stick with this music and it brought me here. All of the musicians would take me under their wing. The problem was segregation was in full force. When we made a recording, it was sweltering hot and we had to keep all the shutters closed 'cause I was the only ofay in the black band, see. 'Cause anybody could peek in, they could call the cops. Sometimes you'd get arrested and they'd haul you off to jail. I spent one night in there, you know. They'd come, like you'd go out before the judge in the morning and they'd say look here, boy. Down here we don't mix cream with our coffee. He'd put it like that, you know. Feeling bad about yourself or that you're a failure. Or that you've let yourself or your family down. -I have an IVC filter in me, which is an inner cardiovascular filter and what it does it catches blood clots and allows them to dissipate actually and won't get packed up on me. I feel like I'm 70 years old. But everything is hurting. My whole body's just. -I've been eating all kind of crazy things. You know, you're on the road, you have to go and eat at Cracker Barrel. -And you still go to that Subway fast food place, don't you? -Yeah, I still go there. But I have little things, look, they're the size of this, they're called torpedoes. -And you know I don't want you to eat the bread. -Well, this is, I was eating the big sandwich like that. But now. -You don't need all the bread. -Now I'm eating the bread is like that, see. -You understand that you don't want the bread. -They put all the salad in the bread. -Yeah, but you don't need the bread. ♪ You won't be satisfied until you break my heart ♪ ♪ You won't be satisfied until you break my heart ♪ ♪ You won't be satisfied until the teardrops start ♪ -I wish we were here every two months and we'll be due here, we have tons of people that come, they look at all the stuff and make notes and then they come back to the auction on Saturday and Sunday and the make bids on it. ♪ I bet you wouldn't like it ♪ ♪ If I didn't say you're only happy ♪ ♪ Tearing all my dreams apart ♪ ♪ You won't be satisfied until you break my heart ♪ Well, we just have a good time playing music and the three of us has had this little trio for oh, years, I mean a long time.

So we have to play upstairs and he just plays his banjo. And Chris, he's a friend of Louis Armstrong. They made an album and you could hear for yourself, we play a different repertoire than most of the local bands do, you know. -We play music. ♪ Papa was a rolling stone ♪ ♪ Wherever he laid his hat was his home ♪ ♪ And when he died, oh, ♪ ♪ He left us all alone ♪ ♪ Papa was a rolling stone ♪ ♪ Wherever he laid his hat was his home ♪ -This is George Ingmire. One of the ways you can support local music is to support the musician because in many ways they work 80, 90 hours a week rehearsing and gigging and that takes a wear and tear on their body. -Well, yeah, it's a fact that we don't live a regulation life. But thank God we got some people that keep us breathing and if we don't be breathing then we ain't living so then they ain't getting that music. -The Musician's Clinic is struggling a bit financially. -It is because we depend on grants and donations and right now our federal grant, which has sustained us because 90% of our patient live on less than $15,000 a year. These are the great musicians of New Orleans, but they make very little money. The really important thing is the federal grant is going to dry up in the next eight months. Wow. -Since Katrina, we were the beneficiary of a three-year federal grant to help sustain medical services here in the city. And we've been blessed with a great riches from this program and are in now year three of the grant, so it's coming to the point where we can see the end of it. -Player Town Oaks, give them another round of applause. They're brilliant. New Orleans. -Well, if I wouldn't have came here, I would have stayed in Atlanta. And I would have did okay in Atlanta. But Atlanta wasn't mine and New Orleans was mine and I felt the responsibility to come back and take care of it because she was sick. And it was sick way before the storm. And all of have a part of making it sick and you get a certain age, you look back, you say all right, I did this wrong, I did this bad. And now I have a chance to make it right, make it better, at all costs.

And I came out victorious and it's really been helpful there to me and I appreciate all my carnival timers I call them, you know, the people that like Carnival Time and like me. -I was wondering, do they have a diabetic book. Photo book can they give me. -Yes, sir, we sure do. -And my kids be saying you ain't supposed to be eating, oh, said they're salty. -You have six, you know, that's gonna be okay. Just don't order three dozen. -All right. I told you get off of the floor and now you hit me right in the head three times, Lord. -Okay, I won't talk about it anymore. -This is my daily routine.

We thank you for all your gifts, especially the gift of the Holy Spirit which helps us pray at the altar. -Well, I gradually just started losing my eyesight peripherally to be honest with you, it started closing in, closing in, closing in. So I had several operations on my eyes because of it. I don't linger on the fact that I can't see. And fortunately I have a son that I continue to do my work. -I have seen my dad all my life just write without the assistance of an instrument. You know, he'll hum a part and it's called relative pitch. Once you know what the first note is, you can go from there. And now since I know this process is very easy. If he hums something for me, you know, rhythmically and pitch, boom, boom, boom, I can just try to get it down as fast as I can with the assistance. -Wadelke was the maestro himself. The genius, that's all I could say about that man. He, even without being sighted he still can come up with some hellified arrangements. -I am working on a composition called the Passion of Christ. The time from Palm Sunday up until the resurrection. It's an undertaking for me because I'm doing it with symphonic instruments, you know like oboe, flute, clarinet, trumpets, trombones. I have six strings in there. Then on the end I have it done where the voices do the amen and the resurrection the hallelujah. It's working out all right. I'm just about 75% finished it. Either someone like what you do or they don't. I hope that they did in my case here, but it was just a gift that was given to me and I have to use. -My goal as a patient of the clinic and as a musician's advocate and as a health and wellness provider, I want to model to other patients that you can overcome a lot of obstacles because I have end stage diabetic retinopathy, which is an irreversible eye condition and I'm still relatively young to be facing imminent blindness but I had been going to a private physician who did a wonderful job and he helped to save my eyes, but when my insurance ran out, the Musician's Clinic stepped in and so believe it or not I have 20/20 vision. I used to go to my parents' home in the Lower Ninth Ward, regularly, even though it was flooded and everything was messed up in the house, I still went because it always felt like home. Every Sunday when I go to church, I want to go there when we finish. And I don't have anywhere to go when we finish because everybody's gone. Everybody in my family is gone. We have a family like most families. We loved each other in our own way. We argued a lot, but you better not mess with us because one of the other ones would kick our ass, you know that kind of situation.

I just thought, you know, wouldn't it be cool to have a song about a person that might be the kind of person that would use the New Orleans Musicians Clinic. So that's what it was, a story about one man.

I didn't know music could make you feel so good. Just little comments like that and you realize you touched somebody. -Losing Walter was very painful for all of us. He was a, he was very fortunate to have access to the Health Clinic, to the Musicians Clinic. They loved him and bent over backwards to provide him with the best care that they could give him and I think that was something that was very touched by. I literally studied with Walter from preschool all the way through high school and for the last four and a half years of his life, he toured the world with the Preservation Hall bands and that was an amazing experience that he and I got to play together in a band. Death is something that is out in the open here. We don't hide behind the doors of a funeral home or church. You know or leave the kids at home because the parents are going to a funeral. You know when I was a kid, I mean, you would go to people's houses and the body would be right there in the living room for a couple of days before the funeral. Dealing with death, emotionally, I think we deal with it better than anybody because we have music and we have this built in mechanism for mourning. You know when that bass drum hits those four beat at the beginning of Closer Walk With Thee, I mean it's time to start, it's time to let it out. It's like on cue, you know. And that's what music does. It allows us to open up these emotional doors. You're gonna miss this person, they're not there anymore and then to celebrate that person. I don't know anybody in New Orleans who's afraid to die. We're all kind of looking forward to it. You know. We all talk about it very openly. We all sort of know that when it is our time, the community comes together at those moments. It's an honor, the deceased. The oldest member of our band, Charlie, he's 80 years old and he just looks at me sometimes when I'm eating a salad or something, they're like, something he just couldn't imagine and he just says man you are gonna die a healthy man. And you know what? There is some truth to that. I think we all want to die healthy. Nobody wants to die sick. Nobody wants to spend the last days of their life sick. I mean, I've seen it too many times and to me that's the sad part, not the death. -Death is gonna happen. Death is certain. None of us can get around it. And you know sometimes it's a surprise and sometimes it's not. Either way it goes, it's gonna happen. And when it happens, you know, you've got to move on. So you try to do that with the music. When you do the music, it's supposed to help you feel so good. Say, all right, he's gone now and you move on. You move on like instantly, like right there, he's gonna be missed, you'll never forget him, but you'll move on quick. -You know I was told a long time ago the proper fitting way for a musician to die is to fall over and die the last note of the last song on the show. The band gets paid and you don't have to play an encore. The people got to see something they'll never get to see again. Somebody died. -Once you're out of view of the church, the band will break into something fast and happy, something like Lord, Lord, Lord, You Sure Have Been Good To Me or Thinny Ramble. And all of a sudden you see this like burden just lifted off people. I mean you will literally see people, you know, get out of their wheelchairs. -The Seondline at a funeral is where people from the community get to go and celebrate the life of someone who died, but I truly believe that it is where you produce the endorphins in your brain that help you get through the tragedy of life. You celebrate. Wasn't this a great life? Rather than what am I gonna do? I don't think I can go on without them. You know, it's we will survive and we will survive as a community and whenever there's a drum beat, we will smile. Because we had to rebuild from scratch, we were able to get electronic medical records. Because we have electronic medical records, we can track illness and I think that because of the Musician's Clinic, we have an opportunity that in a hundred years of jazz has never, ever happened before and that is that we can document each and every person, we can do the best we can for each and every person. We can get the medications that they need and we can try to make sure that they pass on a healthier lifestyle. -Okay, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Mr. Shelton Alexander. The code man is in the house. -I remember as kids we ran. We played cool cats, marbles, spinning tops and football in the sand. We pretended to be stars and formed our own band, a drum line. Makeshift instruments, for instance our cymbals were made of two tops from big gumbo pots. Our snare and base drum we used broken broomsticks and mops, water buckets we'd beat on the top and on the side of heavy duty cardboard boxes. As we marched through the courts of the Iberville Projects, while them little kids watched. We paid attention to the older brothers, I know I learned a lot. As they Second Lined, straight out of the juke joints, the bars and jazz spots, took it to the streets. We joined them whenever they arrived on our blocks, followed them for miles and miles until the music, it stopped. And it started again. And there we were, right behind them. Dancing in the streets. We called is Second Lining, -Second Line is about the line that's behind the first line, which is the band. Usually it's done on jazz funerals, but as you can see, it's become an every Sunday event where you can relieve all your frustrations. Second Lines for the jazz funeral is release the spirits, transform the grief. Now it's a Second Line when we take it and go like this, hey, hey, hey, hey. Every kind of way to overcome your obstacles is a new move. Hey, all of this, hey, oh, oh, hey. Go to the trees and we say this. Oh, shucks, oh, no, every way, hey, hey, hey, hey. -Katrina tore a riff in New Orleans. The music industry and the tourism industry and the cultural aspects of it has suffered. When you lose participants and you lose the fans, then it requires a recalibration. So, it's a smaller city that has not really psychologically came to terms with the fact that it's a smaller city. -I'm from a very large family. And my dad played every instrument except the harp. An aunt of mine I used to have, you stand on your feet hold around the waist and she showed us to dance. Any dance there is, I could do it. I'm a tailor. I play music, I love to dance. And the girls chase me, I don't chase them. I bet. -It's very hard to find a paying audience in New Orleans because it is so come, it is somewhat of a poet in its own land. So much of it, that's almost a natural way of life. We find that most of our funds and most of our development monies that we raise come from outside of New Orleans. New Orleans itself is not a very rich city. It has one Fortune 500 company only, and it's basically a lot of very small businesses. -We have been so grateful to have a lot of European donors who kept our clinic going and many, many of those donors are here for French Quarter Fest in New Orleans. And so we host something we call a Creole Jazz Tea, very casual and so some of our wonderful staff and our volunteers and I have been cooking for days. This is lump crab dip and we have homemade biscuits and homemade cakes and over here, Rose Mancini, one of the nurses at the clinic is chopping the beautiful Louisiana strawberries. -It can go from teaching a patient about diabetes or hypertension or talking to them about depression to talking with providers who might give our clients free care for depression or reduced care for dental care to chopping vegetables. -You pick it up again between the formal sort of ability to provide healthcare and where these people are, they're off the end of the chain. -Yeah, they are. I mean because musicians have always lived under radar. They live under radar on purpose. -I think it's a total fear of the IRS to do an investigation. -And it's also that they have been taken advantage of by producers, record labels, attorneys and it's part of the culture not to trust. That's right. -If you don't get to the Musicians Clinic and actually get plugged in with that, health problems can just escalate and all of a sudden you're in row de court saying going out. It's like just recently I draw my head, Herman Ernest had just went through a whole thing with tongue cancer and I just recently got off of interferon for hepatitic C and for the cirrhosis of the liver. -In my case, you know I suffer with oral cancer and I had surgery. This is like, you know, last year sometime and I had portions of my tongue taken off. At one time the doctors told me I wouldn't talk at all. They said we gonna do it, I said no, you don't. Better give me something. So the guy looked at it, I got the specialist from New York that came here and said no, man, we just gonna take a little piece off back there, pull this out, do that. I said do what you gotta do, but make sure I can talk. So it did slow me down a little bit on talking because boy, it be going, I'm going. -I've gone from waking up at 7 a.m and going to be at midnight to going to bed when the sun is coming up and waking up around 2 or 3, 4:00 in the evening, which is a drag. Taking in 5,000 calories of alcohol every night probably doesn't help anything. I've been feeling sluggish lately. -Musician doesn't equal poor financially. Maybe poor health, health seeking habits, but not necessarily poor financially, so we had to do what was called sliding scale fees. In other words, if you make a certain amount, you pay one thing, if you make more, you pay more. If you make less you may pay nothing. ♪ Good morning America, how are you ♪ ♪ Don't you know I'm your native son ♪ ♪ I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans ♪ ♪ I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done ♪ -Well, the vulnerable part of New Orleans culture right now is that it is a very difficult city to live in. There are a lot of feral children. By that I mean kids who are here without parents. There's a lot of violence. It's easier to get heroin and crack than it is to get a cheeseburger. One of the very positive influences that I feel is continuing to keep the brass band culture alive because brass bands are groups of men who play music together. They travel the world and they make a living at it. Being able to sustain a brass band and have them be role models into the community, for them to go into schools and say, you know what, here's how I take care of my diabetes. Here's how I take care of my hypertension. I don't carry a gun. I don't do drugs and my friends and I are not in a gang. We play music together. -If we don't have a gig, we'll all call each other and say well, hey, we're not doing anything, let's go play in the Square for a little while. There are certain instances where they'll come and shut us down. They'll say well, we either have a complaint or it's a certain time for curfew. They'll make up different reasons to stop us from playing. Which gets a little annoying at times, because of the fact that this is what most people come to New Orleans to see. It's interesting that the police are trying to stop that, you know. This is the heart and soul of the city, the jazz. -Was that the only thing wrong with the horn? Yeah. -Yeah, it's a little sticky. We had a couple of customers that actually were displaced up in Kansas City and we thought, you know, what can we do to help the musicians down here in New Orleans. So I decided that I could just be direct and come down here and help them out. We've had a lot of challenging horns, a lot of horns that just got smashed. We had a chick yesterday who had two borrowed horns that some people had lent her because she didn't have a trumpet and it had actually gotten completely smashed and run over during Mardi Gras by a vehicle. So she had no horn. Somebody loaned her a horn and at the parade somebody was kind of touching her, trying to grab at her, so she smashed him with her horn, but it was borrowed horn, so she was worried she had to get this borrowed horn fixed. So we fixed that horn up and then another horn she was borrowing because she had smashed that one up, so we actually just gave her a horn. So she was really happy. She's got her own trumpet now. We got her other ones fixed up. So we had a gentleman come out yesterday who actually goes by the name of Tuba, but he didn't own his own tuba, so he walked away away with a new tuba. Yeah, it was pretty fun. -We been through a lot. We been through the hurricane together. We been through a few of our band members getting killed, just dealing with New Orleans and everything that come with this city besides the food and the fun and the music. -Six months after the storm. I got out my truck, caught a flat tire. See what was wrong, I looked up, car came, pinned me to my truck, boom. And that you know like. I'm like wow. You know at the time I know I can't believe, you know I wake up, I'm like thinking really it's a dream trying to get up and I'm saying to myself like why I'm not getting up. So, like eventually ambulance came, put me in the thing, tell me you know what's wrong with you? I'm like, yeah, both of my legs are gone and it was, you know, just pushing forward from there. I was in the hospital for three months and on bed for like another bed rest for like another three months, back and forth to therapy. Altogether I was out for like about you could say a good two years. I'm opening up $180,000 surgery bills and, you know, I'm still getting calls about those bills, you know. They still accumulating as we speak. -It was more than just treatment. Treatment is great, but I mean we need it because we gonna just die. It's a repeating cycle, you know, heart attacks and all that. Diabetes, everybody have diabetes. Right after I finish playing a whole nother set I'm a want to eat something. And then it's gonna be mostly something fried and just what else I'm a do. -I started out as a trumpet player, you know a band, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. You know, started out just like everybody else, grade school through high school. Got a scholarship to Southern University, played there in the marching band and wanted to go into jazz. Then I realized I couldn't improvise. When I went to this music store called Werlein's, I saw just pictures, you know the big life size picture of a guitar player like that and I said who is that? And they said Jimi Hendrix and that was a wrap. Man, I was Hendrix all the way. From what I learned in playing covers, I know if I want to work until I die, I'll be playing jazz cover tunes at some hotel, boom, boom, boom on the beach preferably. -You see panic attacks in musicians because of the intense noise in the French Quarter, particularly amplified music blasting out of T-shirt shops that is not New Orleans music per se, but the traditional jazz musicians are having to compete with that, and so not only do we see an increase in deafness in musicians, profound deafness in musicians, but also in mental problems because of trying to compensate for the unbelievable noise. -Well, it's noisy because, you know, everybody's trying to get the business. They think the music is gonna bring people in. I don't agree. I think that bands should do that. They should keep the clubs closed. People can make their choice where they want to go. ♪ The sky is cryin' ♪ ♪ Can't you see the tears roll down the street ♪ -We play horns, we not criminals, we not the ones that's destroying this city and we trying to get other kids to feel like well, it's the cool thing to do, this is what happens here. I'd like to be a part of this and we can't do that if the police is on our back like we on the corner selling drugs. -I generally get cell phone calls and sometimes cell phone pictures from the actual event. And I can do very little when it's happening. All I can do is say let me look into it, let me find out what's going on and we have several pro bono attorneys who've worked really closely with us. And we've tried to do things that are equitable and not dramatic, so that musicians don't end up in jail and that's one of the concerns that we have with the way the new ordinances being enforced. -They been kind of enforcing the noise ordinance on musicians. From the neighborhood complainants, people that live in the French Quarter. -When folks are not knowledgeable and they don't know what we do and why we do it, their ignorance takes place and they make rules or the enforce rules that exist before taking the time to figure out what's going on. -We don't have a curfew, never have. And once they do that, then they gonna lose the economic aspects of the business in this city because this is what New Orleans is known for, we party 24/7. There are other parts of the city you can live in without going in the French Quarter complaining about the noise, 'cause it's not noise, it's music. -Negligence and ignorance. Negligence by not taking care of the musicians. Ignorance because you don't know what you've got. And if you don't know what you have, you know, it really is pearls before swine. -Without our traditions, we are nothing. We don't have our millions of ways of New Orleans people speaking, we don't have nothing. If we don't have our millions of ways of what we do that's part of our tradition, we are nothing. So, somebody is pushed the edges and the boundaries into a thing that's jamming it. I don't think that's correct. -It was so bad the first time when I went to go see my house. You know, I'm a reserve sheriff, too, the sheriff department so I had credentials to come back. Ooh, I seen it all. And I know when I first went back there, you could hear a pin drop in the day time. Wasn't nothing flying but flies. And I never in my life would have expected that I would have 10 feet of water in my house. Never. And I mean last time I seen that kind of water was in 65 and I was a kid when Hurricane Betsy came through here. And it was the same thing. They blew up the levee to try to take the pressure off the levees from downtown and who knows what happened this time. It's a lot went down. So yeah, I changed a whole lot. -Herman was a dear, dear friend but he was phobic about the dentist. So even though he had health insurance and he was a very well paid musician, he got cancer of the tongue and it was undiagnosed for quite a while because he wasn't going to the dentist. So once it was diagnosed, many doctors put forth a valiant effort as did he to save his life and sadly, he succumbed to the disease about six months ago. But in his memory, we want to make sure this does not happen to anybody else, that not being able to afford health insurance should not be a barrier to being able to stay healthy. So this would have been Herman's 60th birthday on the 7th, so that's what we want to do is honor him, celebrate his life and then tell people we're going to do this screening initiative. And it's our New Orleans Musicians Clinic event. -I know he wanted to go out not how he went. He wanted to go out and be playing and then go do the traditional New Orleans way to go. And I love this kid in the psych. He was my partner all through thick, thin, through the ups and the weirds and anythings. And he was suffered and I watched him for about a year come out on the road and he'd have to just, all he could do was make the gig and go to his room and rest till the next gig. And it's not really a life, but he was happy doing that than at the end when we had to get subs and stuff. -I know you up there in heaven's Jazz Fest. This one's especially for you my man. A little Dr. John. ♪ He used to stand in front wherever ♪ ♪ I'd be getting ready for a gig ♪ ♪ And he'd stand in front the door ♪ ♪ Had a piece in his belt ♪ ♪ And he wouldn't let nobody in ♪ ♪ See now this is before he was a visual police ♪ ♪ And the bishop Alvin Shine Robinson ♪ ♪ Gave him that nickname ♪ ♪ Calling him Roscoe, 'cause that's what Bishop ♪ ♪ Called all the peeps ♪ -When I first met Herman, he treated me like I was part of his family immediately. And even though it was Dr. John's band, it is Dr. John's band, he told me whenever we're playing you can just come up, just bring your horn and come up and play. Don't worry about it. Great musician, great person. That's why there was no way I could not be there. That was my buddy. Donald Harrison. -It's good to be back in the house y'all. You know if everybody, where my drinkers at, where my drinkers, say I'm drinking, y'all drinking. My mantra for the day is stop thinking, start drinking, babe. Who's here, who's here, take a big swig, come on. Socials is when we get the crowd to put their drinks in the air. Let me see if I can play this here. Club owners are pressuring me to tell people about the one drink minimum so they can make their money, what have you. And I dare says since I stopped drinking I do a lot less socials, which is probably 'cause once you drunk, you're like yeah, social, I'll make everybody drink. But musically, it's pretty good. Maybe I feel I make more mistakes than I did when I was drunk or maybe I made the same mistakes, but I really didn't pay attention. But you know, a couple of nights I noticed without drinking I missed a few points there. But other than that, you know, no it's fine. ♪ People shining ♪ ♪ I would give you both night and day ♪ And you know they talk about the industry, the tourism industry, $5 billion industry, well, I guess all of that money is not going to the musicians. ♪ Well, I feel like makin' love ♪ ♪ Well, I feel like makin' love ♪ ♪ Well, I feel like makin' love ♪ ♪ Feel like makin' love to you ♪ -Aw.

Jumping up and down and you know I'm pretty diligent about taking my medication, but it's got to be something that I'm eating that's throwing off my coumadin. You know, they still told me my blood is very thick. My stomach woke me up, it was bubbling, bubbling, bubbling and next thing you know, I'm vomiting everywhere, every 10, 15 minutes. So once my stomach is empty, now I'm throwing up bile, which is not a good experience. So, they gonna find out what's wrong. But this is a part of amputation and they telling me they don't want me to work as many night a week as I'm working right now. That might be having an effect on me. I slacked down on drinking. I need to just quit smoking, you know. I can't say, just not feeling good. Once I get through this, okay, I need a hurl bag. See, this is why it's hard to pay bills. When you gotta lay in the hospital, oh. -This picture is from Hello Louis. It was the Louis Armstrong 70th birthday in the Shrine Auditorium Los Angeles. My band, we had to play in the pit and then the first act home was Sara Vaughn. So I'm sitting in the dressing room smoking my cigar and drinking my bourbon. I was drinking in those days and a man come running, he said Mr. Martyn, your band's left to go back home, Sara Vaughn's forgotten her dress. So we went on the stage and played, we played for about an hour and then she came and then all the acts went through and it was the funniest things, I was standing in the wings. These two producers, they were standing there talking, I could hear them and one producer said to the other, we have to cut down Louis' act, because it's about 20 to midnight and Louis was standing right behind me and he heard them and he said ain't nobody gonna cut down my goddamn act. And he just walked on the stage like that and he stopped the band and then he went into. ♪ Hello Dolly ♪ ♪ This is Louis Dolly ♪ You know, his act, you know. But it was a wonderful day for him and I was so proud to be a part of it, you know. -They said my lungs were great. They checked my pancreas, kidney, everything, liver. Who knew? They said it was the plug going into my heart, the IVC filter was clogging up again. And I found out that the reason why I was feeling so bad was because I was drinking a lot of green tea and I found out that was canceling out my coumadin. So maybe after a few weeks of not drinking green tea, my blood'll come back. But my goal is to get off coumadin. I want to get off all the medication actually. -People from all over the world helped us. But in terms of the United States looking at New Orleans as being a jewel in their crown, most Americans don't. We get more money from a little rotary club in northern Germany, than all of United States combined. -I came here a year ago because being a guitarist, I use a lot of pedals and it makes a lot of weird noises and playing loud concerts over the years, I eventually badly injured my ears and had to come in. They're actually really red and inflamed and one of them's actually punctured, but I got prescribed some ear drops and definitely started taking care of it. You know, started to get a little bit better. -This love. Rightfully so talk about a new New Orleans because there just hasn't been enough to come back to really preserve the old 100%. -I think it's important for us to recognize that some people in parts of our culture, in parts of our community are stronger today than they were pre-Katrina. And that's one of the bittersweet pills that we all have to swallow is that there has been this silver lining to this very, very, very dark moment in our history. -We definitely have an upsurge of new talent and new forces, you know. For one thing you have a lot of young musicians playing trad, which is interesting, and you also have a lot of younger jazz musicians, too, that are trying to do their thing. So, you got a lot of new things happening alongside the old, very cool. -It's a difficult thing because I want to play the old school music, but not old school. I want to always bring that modern element to it, so I think the band is kind of catching on and the other thing that's difficult is I'm asking the band to be responsible, each individual, as opposed to me having to constantly dictate, okay, you're gonna solo for this play. I want the band to be able to make good decisions, so even if I'm not there, you know we have a unified concept of music. ♪ One of these mornings ♪ ♪ You're gonna rise up singing ♪ ♪ Spread your little wings ♪ ♪ Take to the sky ♪ ♪ But till that morning ♪ ♪ Nothing to harm you ♪ ♪ Mommy and daddy standing by ♪ ♪ Daddy and mommy standing by ♪ Can I help you? -Yes, are we permitted to play a CD in here.

So for him to put out something by him being a spiritual man, doing the Passion of Christ. He's really thankful for that. Nice piece. -Yeah. Hard to believe you finished it Wardell, it's done. -Put it out. Put it out, it's done? Done. That sounded really good. ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ That was it. Boy that was sweet. -He's an integral part of the R&B and funk and soul scene with his great arranging, you know. On so many hits from down here. He showed us the way. -It's weird when they been friends all your life and stuff, everything changes a gear. Or even when they're people that are like heroes to you, but when they friends and heroes both, and it really gets deep. -Where did you buy your piano. -At LaFog. -Me, too. You got a grand piano? -No, it's not a grand, it's a Spinnett. -A new one? -Yeah. And I'm practicing, I'm working on my next hit. -Are you writing a new song? Three of them. -Three. -I want three hits. For this year. -It's one of the best moves I made in the last so many years, you know, getting this piano and things I should have been doing years ago, you know just taking my time and learning to, you know, to read. I didn't do that, I just picked up a couple of cards and some of the keys and just went on out there, you know, on the piano and that's not quite the way it's done. So now I'm doing a little better and it takes time. And I'm enjoying the time I'm giving to it. Every little break I get, I'll just sit down at the piano and try and do something. -The music has actually been better since the hurricane. I'm just gonna tell you the truth, the music has been better. And it's, think it's because of just what you have to do, what the every day life. It tends to make, what's the term, urgency of now. That's what New Orleans is functioning on. -New Orleans are the only people that can take this and kind of shake it off and try to bounce back right away. It takes a special kind of person to come back and do it all over again. We have a lot of that.

A place that I'm so happy to be a part of, a place that has an energy that I've never felt before. -I do believe now that the musicians understand that we almost lost it. It was almost over with and I think that it is, it's changed them as individuals and they realize that, you know what, that lump on their neck, they need to go to the clinic, not wait for six months. I think that it's really making them realize that we want to be a partner, but it's not our total responsibility. We're not the lifestyle police. -New Orleans, Louisiana, the birth place of jazz. Our culture is rich and unique. We also have style and class. Come on down. Have a blast. Have a cup. Have a glass. You can party with us till however long you last, can't always hide behind a carnival mask. We have Mardi Gras parades, Second Line, Super Supper Sundays. We even have jazz funerals when our saints go marching in and then they fly away to a better place. Man made disaster trying to ruin our celebration like the goal of the victims and people of the off spill. They called destruction and devastation. There are many powers we're facing, an aggressive city, slumping economy, homeless people sleeping under the bridge and there are many still living in poverty. It's worse than before and the divide is still far and wide between the bricks of the city, wouldn't survive without the poor. Can't afford to be ignored anymore. At this point, we'll take you on tour. Follow me and rest in peace to the Snap Drama brothers that never saved the Hot 8. Meanwhile the murder rate is still meeting the nation, amazing. Feels great. However, I'm not gonna focus on that today. This moment's about the great musicians and a self-care situation. No matter how good they play, medical bills are so outrageous, some still can't afford to pay, it's not okay. Can't none of them go out this way, Second Lining. Talented and gifted, some of the best artists that ever exist. Over 2000 musicians, no mack has provided treatment if they ever needed it. Since 1998 they have been dedicated to the mission. Just ask the musicians. And as long as God gives them live and breath until death they'll continue to play. They will continue sing. They will continue to dance, march and step with no regrets. Take a second to reflect and just remember the Big Easy without music. The thought itself is stupid and foolish. Even if some say we the city that care forgot, as long as we care and never forget it and we confident, I can admit, there isn't another city in the world as live as this. So pull out the umbrellas. The sun may or may not be shining. Follow the music, we're not too hard to find. Like L. Johnson said, it's carnival time. Even if it's not, we will still be somewhere in the city dancing in the streets, but we, we call it Second Lining. ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ -Somebody say amen.
