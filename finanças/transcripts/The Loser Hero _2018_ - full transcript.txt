I said, I have superpowers And I can see ghosts There's one floating over the lake I was just kidding I think you have the power to jinx things Don't come over here Is it really haunted here? But I still feel like I have superpowers it's just that I'm not in full control yet and they're still weak If you have superpowers, why don't you show me? There's no use if you can't prove it right? Woah, no way, that's so cool Hey, are you alright? Hero, that's awesome Sorry, I still don't know how to control it You actually have superpowers We're rich, we're going to be rich Let me tell you, I thought of an awesome plan The book said that the brain waves emitted by telekinesis can detect objects I need to concentrate Samantha, be careful Hero Lin, what are you doing?

I can't explain everything I am one of your father's former partners Do you understand? Understand? Anyways, you have a mission and before Uncle Liang died, he passed all of his powers to you that means, you are this generations successor For hundred of years, we shouldered the burden of ridding this city of evil this holy mission was passed on generation by generation Only when you've been vanquished, then the power will be passed on and most importantly you will be rewarded Wait a minute You can exit through the door Thank you There are rewards When you become a superhero, you will understand the rewards You are talented, I can see that but you are still too weak, you need training Hero Dad When you see this recording Dad may not be on this planet anymore The reason that I named you Hero is because actually, our whole family carries the burden of having to save the world Dad doesn't have much time I have to leave with my partners soon to another dimension to save the people We gotta go Shut up, I'm talking to my son here Remember, use your power wisely protect those around you and those you care about Hero, stay strong Dad's leaving now Dad, I know you are a superhero So I am sure that I also have powers I'm not useless, I shouldn't be like this I'm really old now, I can't No way, you're still really good I used to be an Olympic athlete going on for 1 or 2 hours was nothing I would do anything to hold that power once more Not bad Very good Nice Look at those biceps It makes me sick looking at you And you brought a pretty girl too?

Hero, I'm sorry I shouldn't have treated you like that before Thank you for always being at my side protecting me I swear I will protect you like I promised when we were little We will always be friends Just friends? Yeah, we will forever be good friends Hero, come here a second Look When your father wore this, he always ignored his pains that's how a real hero should be to be as determined as he was But I don't know if I could do that Hero, victory isn't something of the future, instead from the moment you decide to act, it slowly adds up Your father could do it, and so can you Where's Ada? A group of people attacked us, good thing Ada saved me Kid, I've already told you before don't let anyone know your dad was a superhero I'm trying to protect you What if something happened to you? How would I be able to face your deceased mother? Didn't I tell you right from the start? Don't easily reveal your superhero identity it will only bring trouble for everyone It's alright, Ada's condition has stabilized Just give him some time to rest These couple of years, kids with superpowers have been attacked I suspect that there is an organization doing this They may be extracting genes from superheroes to make medicine Right, last time the people at the pool hall they injected themselves with some kind of medicine so they had temporary superpowers Charlene, how do you know about the pool hall incident? Kid, you are a special kind of stupid Who do you think saved your ass that day? That was you? I didn't know you had such a figure Little brat, is that all you noticed? Samantha I think This won't do, it's too dangerous The way I see it, is that you all stay here and I'll go get the police, and let them handle this, alright? Just stay put your father often said, "With great power comes great responsibility" Right If it was your father here today he wouldn't hesitate at all Even if it's only me, I will still go Don't worry, I'll help you, I'm coming with Hey, Charlene, I also wanted to ask you something It's that why do you help me no matter what I do? Even when I was still a loser Could you possibly like me? Hahaha What are you talking about? Like you, as if What took you guys so long? Although I don't have superpowers but I'm still the boss of the school, backing down isn't an option Don't think that because you don't need my help you can ditch me and not to mention but sorry, Samantha is my girlfriend I got this Then we'll go find Samantha Last time the police interfered but this time it won't be so easy Let's welcome our special guest, this generation's superhero successor Who else is there, apart from Samantha? Come Uncle If you defeat me I will return the one you love and the things you love back to you or, why don't you exchange with your superpower genes? Child listen to me, don't meddle in this just give them what they want and we can go back to doing our business Uncle, how could you say that? Because this superpower is such a waste being used by you I'm not the same useless person I was before I will not give up everything easily Leave them to me Careful Why Did you forget? When I grow up, I will protect you Really? Ok So it was you that was by my side all the time I will stop you from hurting my family and those I care about Am I really just an useless piece of trash, I refuse to believe You piece of trash I want your power Dan Liu, what's wrong with you? Why did you I'm a superhero I sacrificed everything only wishing for peace in the world In the end, what did I get in return? I wandered the streets Being looked down by everyone That is the reward for being a superhero, do you know that? My power is back There's one more over there You dare hit me? I'm not scared of you I am also a boss Hero, run My power has returned You'll always be trash Mom, why am I called Hero?
