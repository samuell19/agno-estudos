(Multicom Jingle) (dramatic music) - Thanks for covering for me. - You've done it for me more times than I can count. Besides, it's all for love, right? - Definitely love. So, you sure you're gonna be okay here tonight alone? - Get out of here. - I'm gone, I'm gone. - Bye. (dramatic music) - Somebody there? (thunder rumbles) (dramatic music) Hey. (screams) (grunts) - Westwood Inn, this is Tracey, how can I help you? Oh hi. No. She left a couple of hours ago. Sure. Sure, any word and I'll have her call. Okay, bye. (phone clicks) (footseps echo) (suspenseful music) (screams) Somebody call the police, help! Somebody call an ambulance! Help, over here, help! (dramatic music) - Kevin Reese. - Yes, sir? - There's been some trouble, son, and I need you to answer some questions. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Cheryl, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. For sure the most beautiful girl in the state. - You really think so? - Sure, I do, everybody thinks so. - I didn't used to be pretty. I was always more into sports. Some trophies were more important than boys. - So what changed it? - When a dream comes true, I look for new dreams. It's just the kind of girl I am. You always this forward on a first date? - Just the kind of guy I am. - You are, tell me what you wanna do with your life, you know, where you wanna live, how many kids you want? Okay, that's enough. - Come on, Cheryl, just relax. - Jimmy, Jimmy, stop it. - Oh come on, Cheryl, I was only having fun. Hey, you can't go home without me. I got the keys. (grunts) - I'll walk, thank you very much. - Dammit Cheryl, are you crazy? What'd you do that for? Dammit Cheryl, you go fish those keys out. - Make me. - Hey. (grunting) - [Kevin] Hey. - Let go. - Hey! What do you think you're doing, huh? Get over here. Huh? - [Jimmy] Just lay off me, man. - If I ever see you touch her again, you'll answer to me, you got it? - Yeah, that's cool, man, just calm down, man. - I'd ask you to apologize to the lady, okay. - I'm sorry. Okay. Get out of here. - I know I'm staring, I'm sorry, just, you know, you look real familiar. - You've probably seen my picture in the paper. I'm the Dairy Princess. The beauty contest. - Oh, you're the Dairy Princess? Wow, all right. (laughing) - Cheryl. - Kevin. You know, didn't you win that gymnastics medal a few years back? - You remember that? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you used to be quite a tomboy then, but boy, look at you now. - Guess I grew up. - I guess you did. - What do you do with a bucket milker? Got a sick cow? - Yeah, she's on penicillin. How'd you know that? - I have a small herd of my own on some land my dad has. - Is that right, really? Someone as pretty as you, huh? - Can't judge a book by its cover. (laughing) You work on a dairy farm? - No, no, it's even worse than that, I own one. Well, the bank owns it. Yep, that second job I got at the garage, I'm buying it back a paycheck at a time. - Buy it back? - It belonged to my family until things took a turn, three generations ago. A lot of history there. - Can imagine. Land's expensive. That's what I want, too, somebody. My own farm, my own dairy. That surprise you? - Yeah, but something tells me you're full of surprises. (engine hums) - Well, it's my stop. - Wait. Don't go yet. (dramatic music) Cheryl. (birds chirping) You okay? - Yeah. - You just kind of spaced out there. - Oh, I'm fine. You know I'd like to make this up to you, maybe dinner and a movie sometime, my treat? - Well, thanks, but I don't think my girlfriend would approve. - Oh. That's the way things work out sometimes. Thanks anyway. - Okay, see you. (engine revs) - And who would that be? - That Daddy is the man I'm gonna marry. (crowd chatting) - Nice shot. - Well, I only get them when they don't count. That's why I always end up buying beer here on Friday nights. - Kevin should have been here a half hour ago. - Well, he owes the bank 1200 a month, that's a lot of milkings. - We just clicked. It was so romantic and you could just feel the electricity between us. - It's too bad he's taken. - He's not married. Oh God, oh God, there he is. - [Man] Load up a minute. - Was I right or was I right? (growls) - Oh. (laughing) - Guess who? - Don't tell me this is Brad Pitt again. - Come on, you guys, break it up or get a room. - Miss me? - Not for a minute. - Oh, I don't believe that. - God's honest truth, ask Larry. - Hey, no, no, no, don't get me in the middle of this, I just came to play pool. (girlfriend laughing) - Let's settle it on the pool table, huh? What do you say, a game of pool? Winner's right? - Oh, you sure you're up for it? - I think I'm up for it, yeah.

So, how long have you and Kevin been an item? - About two years. - Still not engaged. Sure it's nothing personal. - I was away most of last year at technical school. The travel industry thing. - Kevin's not much for travel, is he? More the settling down type. - And how would you know? - I have great instincts. I'm a people person. - My instincts tell me that Larry's more your type. - You bitch. (screams) (water running) Isn't that always the way? He's the one who's interested in me and yet, he's not the one I'm interested in. That is a great eyeliner. It's the same color my grandma wears. (insects chirping) (romantic music) (Beth laughs) - You got something on your mind? - Where'd you meet Cheryl? - Cheryl, I don't know, I mean, I gave her a ride. Helped her out of a bad situation. That's about it. You don't trust me, do you? - No, of course I trust you. - So what's the problem? - It's just you want a life here in town and you want it right now. - That's right. - You know exactly what you want. You want a farm and a family to help run it. - 2.5 kids. It's the American dream. That is my dream anyway, you know. It's not so much to ask, is it? Then why'd you come here and dance with me, baby?

Brown eyes are all clear again, huh? - You and your animals. Beth would volunteer working with him, telling you, man. - Yeah, well, you and Cheryl were looking pretty good together last night yourselves. - You think so? - Yeah. - Me too. Question is, what does she think? - Well, I tell you what, I think that she is nuts about you. The whole bar was talking. - [Larry] Speak of the devil. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. (car honks) - Whoo. Nice wheels. - It's hard to miss, isn't it? Part of the awards package. I get it for a year. Anyway, I just wanted to give you this. I knitted it myself. I thought it would be good for when you're working in the mornings out here. You couldn't let me buy you a movie, so... - Yeah, you thanked me for that already. - Thanking you again. I'm very grateful. - Cheryl, I'm already in a lot of trouble over that pool game. - It was just a friendly game. And as far as this goes, no strings attached. In fact, I was hoping maybe the four of us could double for lunch today. My treat. I've got a public appearance at the new burger place in town. (upbeat music) (crowd applauds) As your Dairy Princess, I'm happy to be here today. This new Burger Palace will proudly feature milk, butter, and cheese products produced locally by our very own Mayfield County farmers. On behalf of the Dairy Council, it is my pleasure to declare this establishment. (Cheryl laughs) To declare this establishment officially open. (crowd applauds, cheers) (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicks) Oh. They treat me like this everywhere I go. - [Woman] Red meat. - [Man] My daughters will, my daughters. Not that. - Think it would go to my head but it doesn't. Beth. I want you to know you have nothing to worry about. - Worry about? - When it comes to Kevin. He really likes you. He told me so this morning. - This morning? - He said you were concerned about last night, that I might be competition for you or something. A lot of girls feel that way about me, I just... I want you to know, I'm not after him. - Well, see. Who had the strawberry? - Oh, that's me. - [Kevin] Oh. - How 'bout another picture? - Great. - Oh. (camera shutter clicks) - So shoot me. I don't like the Dairy Princess. All the cream has gone to her head. - [Kevin] Cheryl's okay. - So what was she doing there this morning? And why were you telling her such personal things about me? - How do you know that she showed up? - She told me I have nothing to worry about, is that right? Do I have nothing to worry about, Kevin? - You know, she's right, you're jealous. - [Beth] I'm not. - Yes, you are. - I just don't wanna be taken for granted. I mean, you have our whole future planned. You have us married and planted, raising a family. - You don't want that? - Well, yeah, someday, but not right now. I have plans of my own. - Like what? - Don't you ever listen to me? I want to travel and I don't know, maybe someday go to college. - Well, Beth, I mean, what about the farm, huh? I mean, what am I supposed to do, just wait until you make up your mind? It was my family's, come on, where are your values? - My values? - Yeah. - All you want is a mirror image of yourself. Some woman who will give up her dreams just to fit this neat little picture you have of the future. You want you in a dress. - Is this about Cheryl, huh? 'Cause I don't know where this coming from. - No, this is about us. - About us, huh, what us? I don't know who I'm talking to here, Beth. I mean, I used to be enough for you. - Well, maybe I need more. - Well maybe you should find it, you know, somewhere else. 'Cause I've had it with this attitude. - Kevin, we can't go on like this. - All right, let's not. Say it was fun while it lasted, you want more? Well, so do I. Here. Car's ready. (door slams) (engine revs) (tires squeal) (metal clangs) (insects chirping) (door slams) (door creaks) (suspenseful music) Beth? (suspenseful music) - Bout time you were getting home. (suspenseful music) I know the kind of hours you've been putting in lately and I just wanted to make sure you had a good meal tonight. - How'd you get in? - Your door was unlocked. You know that's really dangerous? Anyone at all could just waltz right in. - Cheryl, you know, I'm really not up to any kind of company tonight. - Oh. I won't stay. - [Kevin] Well, I mean, this is all really very nice of you. - No, no, no need to explain. You just sit right down and enjoy it. There's seconds right here and I put a couple casseroles in the fridge for later in the week. I put little instruction sheets with them under the plastic. If you have any questions, just call. (door creaks) (insects chirping) (bell rings) - Oh, she's back. - Yes. - Kevin, hi. Is this seat taken? - No, no, it's yours if you want it. Didn't know you came here? - No, I usually go to Lutheran church across town but I felt like a change. I didn't know you went here. Small world. - Small town.

She's the Dairy Princess for God's sake, what more could you ask for? - Beth. I don't know, I can't help it. You know, I love her, I'm in love with her, and it's never gonna change. (engine hums) (bell rings) - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. I got your card. It's cute, cow and everything. - Eh, thought it might cheer you up. - So what can I do for you? - My engine is missing. I mean, it's still under the hood. (laughing) But it's missing. Can you take a look at it for me? - Oh, yeah, well just pop the hood. - I notice it mostly when I try to accelerate. - Yeah. Can you leave this? - You're the doctor. Maybe you can bring it by my house later? - Yeah, Larry's got my truck today, so I'll bring it by if you give me a ride home. - Sounds like that works out for both of us. Guess it's fate, huh? See you later. (birds chirping) - You look so nice. Very professional. - A manager's position might be opening up in Cleveland. I wanna make a good impression just in case. - [Mom] Cleveland, what about Kevin? - We want different lives, Mom. I don't know how to make it work. - The two of you... What does he say? - All the wrong things. (engine hums) (door creaks) - Come meet my dad. - [Kevin] Okay. - [Cheryl] Daddy, this is Kevin Reese. - [Kevin] Hello, sir. - Some problem with the car? - Yes, sir, the carburetor's out of adjustment. Don't know how it got to be that way. - So... How long have you and Cheryl been dating? - Dating, oh, no, sir. - No, no. Daddy, Kevin's a friend. - Ah, well. It's hard for me to keep up with my daughter sometimes. - Kevin, I wanna show you my room before we go. - Okay, well, good to meet you, sir. - I promise we'll keep the door open, Daddy. My mother died when I was 12. Never saw two people more in love than my parents, so now he smothers me with love. So overprotective, it's embarrassing sometimes, you know. Nobody's good enough for his little girl. (bird chirps) - Hello. Really like cows, don't you? - What'd I tell you, they're my life. We can go by my herd on the way, if you want. - Yeah, I'd like to see that. I'd like to see anything you wanna show me. (dramatic music) - What'd you say? - I say I'd like to see your herd on the way home. - Oh, great. Just give me a minute to change. - I was barely six years old when I helped pull a newborn calf from inside its Mama. - Oh. - Yeah. Felt like God, you know. God at six years old. (Cheryl laughs) Dairy farming, that's all I've ever known. It's what makes me happy. - Yeah, I know. Most people don't understand how we feel about it. How deep that feeling goes. - Yeah, yeah. See, I wanna buy my land back from the bank. I wanna settle down on it, and I wanna make it a success. - Get what you work for. You work hard enough for anything, you get it. That's the principle this country was built on. (dramatic music) - Everybody laughed at her. - You know, I don't even remember her that well. - Well, that tells you everything you need to know right there, and if you play your cards right, two weeks down the line, Kevin won't remember her either. Where are you going? - Early dinner break. (engine hums) - Well, I guess it's my turn to thank you for the ride, huh? - Do you mind if I use your bathroom before I head back? - It's right around the corner. (door creaks) (keys jangle) (paper rustles) Finding everything okay in there? - Fine. (phone beeps) - Yeah, Larry, it's Kevin. Listen, I'm gonna need an extra hand next week, and I was wondering if I could get first dibs on your time. (rooster crows) Oh. Listen, Larry, let me call you back in a bit, okay? - You like? Bought it today just for you. What do you think? (engine hums) - Cheryl, if I've, you know, given you the wrong idea about us... - What's wrong? Don't you want me? - No, I mean, any man with breath in his body would want you. - Then prove it. Kiss me. (door creaks) - Beth. Beth. - Let her go. - Beth! Beth, honey, listen, I can explain, all right? - There's nothing-- - She could-- - There's nothing to explain. I saw what I saw. Just came to say you were right. It is over, Kevin. (engine revs) - Baby, give me a chance, huh? (grunts) Fuck. Get out of my house. - You don't mean that. - Yes, I do. Now get out and stay out. Get away from me.

Half the girls in this town would faint if he even looked their way, and I'm the one he picked. I thought you'd be proud. - You know I don't keep up with all this. If your mother was here-- - Well, she's not, I am. - I know you're here. - Do you? Daddy, I'm your daughter, and you never even look at me. I could be 12 years old for all you care, you just sit with your pictures and your memories of Mama. - I can't help it if I still miss her. - Would you miss me that much if I were dead? - Don't even joke about a thing like that. - Well, Daddy, I bring home good grades, and trophies and blue ribbons and it's never enough. Kevin. When he looks at me, he really sees me. I'm not that little girl anymore, Daddy. With him I'm a woman. - Are you sleeping with this man? - I would if he asked me. - I won't have that talk in this house. Not while you're under my roof. - It's fine with me. - Where'd you find this? - Well, I know it's not much but the rent is right. And look, I can see your place from here. - I know. So does your dad know that you're putting your cattle on my land? - [Cheryl] It's none of his business. - Just thought, you know, I should talk to him, make sure it's okay. - It's none of his business. Look. Let's not talk about him, okay. I feel good today, I don't wanna spoil it. - Okay. (cow moos) - Well, what do you think? The first place I can really call my own. - Uh huh. Well, this is some big adventure, huh? - Yep. This place can be anything I want it to be. And I can be anything you want me to be. (Kevin laughs) - Cheryl, you just, you can't just become what someone else wants. You kind of gotta be yourself. - I know you do. And who I am just happens to be exactly what you want. Nothing wrong with that, is there? - Nope. (cow moos) - There you go. Look at that, huh? Look who's back on her feet. Come on, let's go. - Out. - Get out. Three milkings a day. - Come on. - You keep this pace up, you'll be able to give up work at the garage before you know it. - It's harder now. I have Cheryl's group as well. - Yeah, how's that going? - It's going all right. Oh, oh, oh. - You love her? - You know, she cooks for me, she dresses for me. Plans her life around me, and all I have to do is just mention I'm interested in something and that's all she talks about. Beth never did that. - Well, Beth has a life of her own. A job, volunteering with the hospital. She started tutoring at Jackson Elementary, did you know that? - It's who she is. She uh, she's like that. It wasn't going anywhere, Larry. - You miss her? - Make any difference, come on, come on. - And I've got two deaf first graders who love to paint so I bought them watercolor sets. They need me and it feels good to help them. - You can't do that flying around the world. There's lots of people that need you right here at home. I work for one of them. Look... He may be with Cheryl now, but if you wanna know the truth, you're all he thinks about. - Can you push me on the swing, Ms. McKinnis. - Sure, I'll be there in a second, okay, sweetie? - You miss him? - It doesn't matter now. She's got him and I don't. (bird calls) (dramatic music) - Oh. (dramatic music) Oh. Oh that's the one. The only one that'll do. (dramatic music) Oh. (dramatic music) - I thought you two were the perfect couple, at least that's the word that Cheryl's spreading around town. - Well, she gives me everything that I want, but nothing that I need. You and me, we're different. - I thought that was the problem. - I did, too. But you know I realized that we have different goals, but we're alike where it counts and we can grow from that. I want you back, Beth. I never stopped loving you. (dramatic music) You know, can't we compromise? See you wanna career in travel-- - There's no agency here. - But couldn't you open one on your own? - Kevin, you know I can't afford that. - No, but... See maybe we can. We can work on our goals together. Maybe we could travel ourselves from time to time, if you want. I've never seen much of the world. Maybe it's time that I did. - You would do that for me? - Man. There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you. So can we try? Can you give me another chance? (dramatic music) (women chatting) (knocks) (door creaks) - Hi! - Hey. How you doing? - I'm trying something new. You can't tell yet but I think you'll like it. - Yeah. - If you don't, I can go back to what it was in no time at all. - No, no, I think it looks fine. I mean, you always look great. Can we get together some place later to talk? - Now's a good time. It's about to set. - No, this isn't the right place. - Tell me. Honey? You're scaring me, tell me. - Well, listen Cheryl. You know something, you're a wonderful person, and I mean that, but I made a mistake and I wanna fix it before we go too far. - What kind of mistake? Oh God. Is this about Beth? - I still love her. - No. No. No, you don't, you... You think you do, but you feel sorry for her. You don't love her. - Yes, I do. Now, you know something, Cheryl, you're really great and I mean that. - Stop it. Stop it, Kevin. You're not thinking clearly. I'm right for you and she's not. I'm everything you need, and if you need more, I can be that, too. - There's something, all I really need is for you to understand. - Can't you see what a mistake you're making? All that she wants is to get you back so she can break up with you again. She can't stand to see us together. - No, no, that is not what it is all about. Okay, Beth and I, we've got a history together, and I'm not gonna just toss that aside. - So you toss me aside instead? - I'm sorry. (dramatic music) - I love you. I've never said that another man, as long as I've lived. Doesn't that count for anything? (dramatic music) - Yeah, it counts for a lot. I can't see you anymore. (dramatic music) (door slams) (engine revs) (tires squeal) (dramatic music) (keys jangle) (Cheryl cries) (door slams) (sweeping music) - Cheryl, I'm sorry. Meet me at the Colston Motel Room. 301 tonight at 10. Oh. Oh yeah. He does love me. (Cheryl laughs) (insects chirping) (door creaks) Kevin? Anybody home? Oh. (door creaks) Hi, wait, wait. Don't say a word. I want you to know that I understand why you said the things you did. You were afraid. 'Cause it's all so perfect. Well, I'm afraid, too. The truth is you're the only person who's ever really loved me, and that's why I love you too, Kevin, and I'll never leave you. What are you doing here? - The note was from me. I knew he broke up with you today, I wanted to make it up to you. - Make it up to me how, by tricking me to a motel room and raping me? - No, I wanted to talk to you. I thought we'd get to know each other. - You get away from me. Beth put you up to this, didn't she? - She doesn't know anything about it. - Oh. And I'm supposed to believe that? You're all laughing at me, everybody, the whole town. - Cheryl, no one is laughing at you. I wanted to get to know you. I like you. - By ruining my reputation. You're gonna pay for this. I don't know how and I don't know when, but you are gonna pay, all of you. (door slams) (engine hums) (dramatic music) - Larry. (dramatic music) Larry? Larry? Larry, Larry? Larry? Larry? No! No! No! No! Please. (bell rings) It doesn't make any sense. - Death never does, Kevin. - He was the first friend that I ever lost. Could be a real pain sometimes. I just wish that I could have told him how much our friendship had meant. - He felt the same way. I don't think either of you were into talking about feelings. - Just never know when you're seeing someone for the last time. (upbeat music) - Oh no. - What is it, honey? (fiddle music) - Kevin, hi. - Oh, hey. - Do you know Hank Fisher? - I haven't had the pleasure, hello. - Cheryl tells me you own a dairy farm? - Yeah, yeah, you? - No, I wouldn't know which end of the bull to milk. That's a joke. No, I'm in sales. The used car lot over on Maple. You need some equipment though, I can get you a good deal. - I was so sorry to hear about Larry. - Yeah, yeah, it's been a tough couple of weeks. - Hank, it's a little chilly. Would you get my coat for me? Oh, thanks. - Well, he seems like a nice enough guy. - Friend of the family, mercy date. Look. I was hoping to run into you. I want you to know that I'm fine with everything. I understand your decision, and all I care about is that you're happy. - Well, thanks, you, too. - And I promise I'll move my cattle off your land soon, I just, good pasture land is hard to come by, and Daddy and I. - Well, there's no rush, you know, whenever. - You know, Larry really loved you. We didn't spend a lot of time together, but you were the best friend he ever had. He told me. I really miss him. - You have no idea how valuable you are to this community, Beth. - Well, it's work I enjoy. - [Man] Well, I hope you have no plans of leaving us in the near future. (fiddle music) - Did you have fun tonight? - Yeah, fine. - Yeah, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You upset about Cheryl? - You explained it. You sure you're over her, Kevin? - There is absolutely nothing between us, okay? Okay? Okay. (fiddle music) (crowd cheers) - [Dancer] Right, yeah, right. - I just never thought that I was the jealous type. - Yeah, well, it's good that you got some of that in you. Yeah. I just hate to see my wife let me go off with just anyone. - Your what? - You know what happened with Larry taught me that life's too short. You know, if you want something you gotta grab it while it's there. I want you. So what do you think? Will you marry me? - Kevin, I love you so much. (fiddle music) (paper rustles) - Oh. (dramatic music) Oh. (dramatic music) Stupid Cheryl. Stupid, stupid. Stupid Cheryl. (Cheryl cries) (engine hums) (birds chirp) (suspenseful music) - Kevin? Kev? (suspenseful music) - Beth? Beth? (footsteps echo) Where are you, Beth? Beth? (suspenseful music) Beth? Beth, come on, this is ridiculous. I know you're in here. I saw your car. (chicken squawks) (cat meows) (suspenseful music) (cow moos) Ah. - Are you following me? - Following you. In case it slipped your mind, my cattle are still here. Little paranoid, are we? - If you're looking for Kevin, he got an early start at the garage, I think. - Well, maybe that's good because I think we need to talk. For some reason, you seem determined to ruin my life. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I mean... You wrap yourself in all this saintly innocence, and all the while you are plotting and planning and scheming against me. Are you jealous, is that it? Because I'm prettier than you? - I don't have anything against you, unless you count how you weaseled your way into Kevin's life. - He left you for me, it's because he wanted to. - No, we were having problems, and you knew exactly which buttons to press. - You don't know me. - I know your type. - Look who's talking. You steal my boyfriend, you set me up in a cheap motel, what'd I ever do to you? - What motel? - I know, okay, I know what you did. - I am getting out of here. (footsteps echo) (cow moos) Get out of my way. - Not until we settle this. - Settle what, that Kevin loves me and not you? That's just a fact. We'd been dating long before he even knew you existed. - Maybe so. But then, when he realized how much better I was for him, you couldn't handle that, could you? You had to get him back. How'd you do it, sleep with him? He told me that, um, that you two had never done the deed, the whole time you were together. We slept together every night. Couldn't get enough of me. - Kevin's not like that. Our relationship isn't based on sex. It's something deeper than that and something you'll never understand. - Go! All the two of you ever want me to do is understand. Well, I don't understand. I will never understand. What about what I want? - What do you want? - I want Kevin. (birds chirping) (cow moos) I worked for him. So I should have him. That's how it works. Nobody ever treats me like this and gets away with it. (dramatic music) You get back here. You get back here or I'll... (grunts) - I had a really good time tonight. - Yeah, well, so did I. - I want to talk to you about something. It's about Cheryl. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, some other time, all right? Don't wanna talk about anyone but us tonight. This is our night, it's nobody else's. And anyway, I got something for you. This here was my grandmother's engagement ring, and now it's yours. If you want it. (dramatic music) - Kevin. It's so beautiful. - Oh. - Yes. - Huh? (laughing) Guess that this makes it official, huh? - Okay, that's number 17 on the first floor. You can park out front, and if you have any questions, just ask. I'll call the police. They're not two minutes away. - No, no wait. I just want to apologize to you. - Apologize? Doesn't really seem your style. - Oh, you're mad. I really can't blame you for that. I was way out of line yesterday, I'm sorry. - Let's just say I accept your apology and leave it at that, okay? - I don't know what got into me. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? One cup of coffee, six feet from the reception desk? - I'm okay here, Beth. Go ahead if you want to. - If you're worried that I've told Kevin about what happened yesterday, don't. We had a really nice evening last night, and I didn't want to spoil it. But I swear, Cheryl, if you ever... - Oh, no, I won't. It's just been a really hard time for me, you know? Cream and sugar? - Black. - Oh. I have to drink mine with cream. It's in the Dairy Princess rule book. It's a joke. I guess I'm late in learning that life and love aren't always fair. Is that an engagement ring? - [Beth] Yes. - Oh. Congratulations. - Don't say that, it's bad luck. - Oh, is it? Oh, I didn't know. Anyway. I'm going away this afternoon. Back to college. - What about your life here? - What life? My friends, my family? My father never really cared for me, and now that you've got Kevin, my life's a joke. I'm a joke. - That's not true, don't say such things. - Well. I hope you and Kevin are as happy as you possibly can be together. - Well, thanks. - I just didn't wanna leave with any bad feelings between us. - I'm glad you stopped by. - [Cheryl] Really? - [Beth] Really. - So are you gonna be coming back to town from time to time? - Holidays maybe. 200 miles is a long drive. Mostly I'll be hitting the books, agriculture, animal husbandry. - You really do want that farm someday. - I really do. I'll move my cattle next time I'm here, promise. - No, it's fine. That's fine. It's no rush. Okay. - Well, you and Beth take care of yourselves, okay? - [Kevin] Yeah. - Sorry it didn't work out between us, but that's life, right? - Yep. Well, let me know next time you're in town. - You'll know. (dramatic music) (people moan) - Oh God, oh. - What? - Just wait. - What, what, what? - [Kevin] Wait, no, don't, don't move, don't move. Don't move. Oh, oh. - [Beth] Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, no I'm... I'm okay now. (groans) Oh, yeah. Boy, this can't be good for a person. Will you remind me again why it's a good idea that we wait till we get married, huh? - Because we said we would. - Right, right. But... Was that your idea or was that my idea? - It was your idea. - Oh, I don't really think it was my idea. I kind of think that it was your idea. - It was two years ago. Who remembers? - But if it wasn't your idea, and I know it wasn't my idea, then... - We've wasted a lot of time. - So you wanna? Yeah. Okay. Oh. Not here, okay. It's gotta be special. - Okay. - Okay. - When, then? - Well... Thursday. Thursday. Yeah? And I'll get us a nice bottle of wine and light some candles, huh? - Can I ask you something, without you getting mad? - Sure. - Did you sleep with Cheryl? - No. - Thanks for covering for me. - You've done it for me more times than I can count. Besides, it's all for love, right? - Definitely love. Oh, you sure you're gonna be okay here tonight alone? - Get out of here. - I'm gone, I'm gone. - Bye. (insects chirping) (thunder rumbles) (suspenseful music) - Somebody there? (thunder rumbles) - Hi, got a minute? - Well, actually Kevin's expecting me. Why aren't you at school? - Oh, come on, I came all this way. Five minutes tops, girl talk? - Is my car okay? - Yeah. (thunder rumbles) - So how's college? - It's only been a week. It's too soon to tell. You know why I'm here. - No, I really don't. - You stole Kevin from me with your lies. Why couldn't you let him be happy? What kind of a sick thing was that to do to him? - Get out of my car. - No. - Then I'll get out. Listen to me, Cheryl. I think you need help. - So now it's my problem? No, no, you're my problem, and you know why? I went off the pill when I was with Kevin and now I'm pregnant. - You little liar. - How does that make you feel? What do you think he'll do when I tell him? Who do you think he'll choose then? - You'll do or say anything to get him, but you know what? The bottom line is your tricks don't work anymore. Face it, Cheryl, you've lost him. He doesn't love you. He never did and he never will. (dramatic music) (Beth screams) - Now Kevin won't waste his time with you anymore. It's your own damn fault. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (Cheryl grunts) (suspenseful music) (engine hums) - See, we were supposed to get together tonight. And she didn't show up, and I said to myself that maybe what happened is that she didn't feel the same way, that she had changed her mind about things. About me. - Can anybody verify that, son? That you were here tonight. - I was alone. You can talk to her parents 'cause I called them up. (cow moos) - I think we both know that's not proof you were home when you called or that you weren't out before that. We'll check the phone records just to be sure, though. (woman cries) - I just saw him. - Kevin. (woman cries) My little girl. (woman cries) - I know, I know. I know. (knocks) - Hello? Hi, Dad, what's up? Oh, you're kidding. How awful. Do they know who did it? (phone rings) - Yes. - Kevin, it's Cheryl. - [Kevin] Hi. - You sound terrible. - [Kevin] Is there something you wanted? - Oh, I'm at school and I just heard the news and I'm so sorry to hear about Beth. Nothing like that ever happens in Cloverdale. - You know. I really appreciate the phone call, but I'm not really in the mood for talking to anyone right now. - I understand, I just... I just want you to know I'm thinking of you. - Thanks. - [Cheryl] Do they know who did it or why? - Well... Earrings had been taken, cash is gone, some people said they saw a drifter hanging around town last few days, but no one really knows anything for sure. - Well, just know that I'm here, if you need to talk or you need a shoulder to cry on. I'm just a phone call away. - [Kevin] Thanks. (phone beeps) (dramatic music) - You can only imagine how stunned I was by the news. - I can only imagine. - You know how close we were, Beth and me, I mean, we had our differences, but friends are forever, don't you think? - Frankly, Cheryl, I don't know what to think. - Oh, did you hear something that night or see something? - No, why? - I'm helping the police try to get to the bottom of this. You know, it's all such a mystery. Who could have done such a thing? - I wonder. Maybe these phone records will help. - Phone records? - Yeah, it's a list of all the calls coming in and out of the office the night of the murder. (woman screams) - [Cheryl] Oh, why don't I run this right over to the sheriff's office? - [Woman] No, he's coming by to pick them up. - Oh. Clumsy me. Dropped your scissors. Well, I gotta run. You know, I'll miss her like crazy. Then, I guess, we all will. (dramatic music) - No one can say why these things happen. Why someone as good as kind as Beth McKinnis is taken from us in the prime of life. (dramatic music) We can only take comfort in the joy she gave us while she was here among us. And in Beth's case, that joy was boundless. Everyone knew her. Everyone loved her, and we're all the better for having known her. - Told you I'd always be here for you. I'll miss her, too. (birds chirping) - Worked this land with my father, till his health gave out. When he moved, all he could leave me was a stack of bills, but I paid 'em off. Planned a life here with Beth. (sighs) Everything was just working out like it was supposed to, and then this. So I got the cattle and I got the land, but I don't know what good it is without her. (birds chirping) Why are you crying? - I'll miss her, too. And I'm just so scared. If such a terrible thing could happen to someone like Beth, I mean, could just as easily happen to me. - No. You're talking crazy now. - I'm scared, Kevin, please, please, Kevin. Hold me. (birds chirping) - [Kevin] Cheryl. - Looks like it's just you and me now. We're all that's left. We're just gonna have to carry on together. - What are you thinking? You thinking that just because Beth is gone... Now you know something, I told you before. There's no us. We don't fit. - We do. We do and there's nothing stopping us now. - What kind of a sick thought is that? You stay away from me. - No. - You just get away, stay away. - [Cheryl] After everything I've done for you, you can't just-- - No, I said, Cheryl. - Don't run away. - Cheryl, get away and you stay away, okay? - [Cheryl] Kevin. Kevin you can't just leave me here. (door slams) Kevin! (engine revs) Don't you dare walk out me again. (dramatic music) - Sheriff. Coroner said it was possible she was strangled with a belt. Look like scratch marks to you? - [Sheriff] Let's compare the leather with the scrapings we found under her fingernails. This tip might pay off after all. - [Deputy] Got some initials here. It's K R. - Kevin Reese? - I haven't seen that belt for more than a week. - This is what you want me to believe. - You know, something, you believe what you wanna believe, but that doesn't change the fact that I didn't do it. - Gotta be honest with you, this doesn't look real good son. You be staying around town? - Oh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere. - See that you don't. - She loved Kevin. Kevin loved her. - We just have to follow every lead. The act of strangulation, the strength required, 99 times out of 100, points to a male assailant. - What about that drifter? - No sign of him, if he ever was here at all. Descriptions are vague at best. No reliable witnesses. - Well, one thing I know for sure, it wasn't Kevin Reese. - Didn't work out with Kevin and me. He was still in love with Beth and everybody knew it. You have to accept things like that. - When he went back with her, proposed to her, how'd you feel? - I understood, just the kind of girl I am. - Where were you the night of the murder? - 200 miles away. - Yeah. We already checked the school. Your car never left the parking garage. - Well, then, you know. - I'm just hoping you can help me get to the bottom of things, find out what happened that night, and since you were so close to Kevin at one time. - Oh. If you're thinking Kevin might have done it, he could never do anything like that, no matter how unhappy he was with Beth. - Was he? Unhappy with Beth, I mean, if they were as perfect as you said. - They were. Some people in town had the feeling that maybe she didn't appreciate him enough. Maybe he deserved better, you know how people talk. - What was your feeling about this? - That it was none of my business. If he was happy, I was happy. Anything else? (cow moos) - No. I was looking over the high school annuals, you were on sports teams in school, weren't you? - [Cheryl] Yep. - Quite the athlete? Gymnastics and wrestling. - I won my share of trophies, why? - Just surprised me, is all. You must be stronger than you look. (door slams) (engine revs) (bird chirps) (engine hums) (door slams) (insects chirp) - Didn't have much of a chance to talk this trip. - Nothing left to talk about, I guess. - I couldn't let you go back to school without telling you... Without saying... - Without saying what? - That I love you, Cheryl Ann. I really do and I am proud of you. (insects chirp) - It's all I ever wanted to hear. (insects chirp) (dramatic music) Thought we weren't speaking to each other. - I was hoping that you were still in town. - As if that makes any difference to you. - It does. You know, I was really hoping that we could get together and talk. - Why? - I was thinking about it, and like you said, we're all we've got now. Unless you didn't mean that. - Oh, no. Oh. Oh, Kevin, I meant what I said. I did. I'm here for you no matter what. - Then we can see each other? Maybe we can get together someplace quiet where we can talk? - Be careful. - How 'bout my place, eight o'clock? - Boy, you're just too good to be true. - I'll see you tonight. (dramatic music) (phone beeps) I'm glad you're beginning to realize that. - Temper? You didn't see it often, but when you did, you stood back. You should have seen him take on a couple of truckers in here one night. - Wouldn't wanna get on his bad side, I guess? - Not me, not you if you're smart. (dramatic music) - [Kevin] I want you back, Beth. I never stopped loving you. - Kevin, I love you so much. - Then why don't you come here and dance with me, baby? - Take me. (Kevin laughs) - Some woman who will give up her dreams just to fit this neat little picture you have of the future. You want you in a dress. - [Kevin] Baby, give me a chance, huh? - [Beth] Kevin, I love you so much. - [Cheryl] I can be anything you want me to be, and who I am just happens to be exactly what you want. - [Kevin] Something tells me you're full of surprises. - Did you sleep with Cheryl? - [Kevin] No. - [Cheryl] I'll always be there for you. - Larry! - Love me back, Kevin. - Larry! Larry, Larry. (dramatic music) (knocks) - Kevin, hi. Come in. - What's all this? - I made dinner, pot roast. Told me once it was your favorite. - Oh, you don't forget a thing, do you? - Not when it comes to you. I hope you haven't eaten. - You know, you shouldn't have gone through all this trouble. - Oh, it's no trouble. I love cooking. And I'm glad you're finally putting all this Beth business behind you. It's important to move on. Otherwise, we never get anywhere in life. You seem so far away. Something wrong? - Police found the belt, my belt, someone used it to strangle Beth. - It wasn't you. Everybody knows you didn't do it. Just like everybody knows I didn't do it. - Point is, looks like someone's trying to frame me. - Oh. That's awful. But, you know, I mean, I know how you feel. The police have been asking me all sorts of questions and I hate it. Maybe... No, nevermind. - No, what is it, go ahead. - Well. I was thinking. What if we were each other's alibi? - But they know that I was waiting for Beth. - What if we were both waiting for Beth. We were gonna tell her that we were in love and we intended to be together. Wouldn't that make sense? - It was just an earring, but if he's right, then-- - Your friend is playing on your sympathy. We're heading out to pick him up now for the murder. - You've gotta listen to me about this. If that earring means what he thinks it does, then Cheryl Davis is the dangerous one, and he's at her place right now. - I appreciate you help on that score, but I think we know what we're doing. You'll excuse us. (dramatic music) - You're arresting the wrong person. - Of course they could still force me to tell them information that you shared with me in confidence, unless... This is really a wild idea, but... A wife can't testify against her husband. (dramatic music) - What would you do for me, huh? How far would you go for me? - Oh, Kevin. Oh, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. - Yeah. - Don't you know that? I love you. I loved you from the first day we met. (dramatic music) - Would you kill for me, huh? - Is that a joke? - Oh, you're hurting me. - Did you do it, huh? Did you steal my belt? Did you kill Beth? - How can you even ask that? That's insane. I found this in the field where Larry died. - Lot of people wear those. - No one I know. No one but you. - Oh. So now I killed Larry, too. So now I'm this serial killer running around Cloverdale with a gun in one hand and a bottle of poison in the other? I think I'd like you to leave. - Hey. (gasps) What's this? - It's nothing. (dramatic music) - You think that I don't recognize my own grandmother's ring? I gave this to Beth, now how'd you get it unless you were there when she died? - It should have been mine anyway. - Oh my god, it's true. - You would have given it to me someday. I worked for it. - What kind of a monster are you? - Somethings work out for the best, but some things you have to have a hand in. I only meant to scare her. I didn't mean for it to go that far. (suspenseful music) Can you believe she told me that she was pregnant with your child? How can somebody lie about something like that? Why couldn't you see through that tramp? (Cheryl screams) - I'm taking this. - You bastard. - To the police. You think I loved you? I could never love you. You don't even know what real love is. My god, you should have killed me. She was my life and you took that away from me. (Cheryl grunts) (dramatic music) Here's your knife. You kill me, kill yourself. Right now I don't much care. - [Cheryl] Kevin, you come back here. (dramatic music) Kevin, come back. Kevin! Kevin, wait. No! I'm sorry. (dramatic music) Don't leave me. Kevin, I love you. I did it for you. (dramatic music) (somber music) (Multicom Jingle)
