[rattles shaking] [drums beating] [chanting] [chanting continues] [chanting stops] [no audible dialogue] [sighs] Good morning. [chuckles] Good morning. They're beautiful. So where do we go? Arizona? Nevada? A desert cabin... with a view. Far enough we can't get caught. It's a sign. You sound like your father. [crows cawing] [Willie Boy imitates crow] What is it? Carlota! [footsteps approaching] [sighs] It's over. So, what, you won't listen to me? Never. Do you understand me? Never. You will never have my permission. He's blood. I want you to say it. Now, go! Move your head! Say it! I will never have your permission. Do you understand me? I never want to see you again. [Carlota] Please! I said it. Please! Enough. What are you thinking? Ghost dance? Taking her from her family? Some things just ain't for this life, Willie Boy. My girl, we have to go. Soon, this will all be a memory. The horses should be resting during the hottest part of the day, not starting out. Let's go. Come on. Carlota. Hey. Carlota. [clicks tongue] Desert heat we can handle. Today we suffer because of you. She ran away with her cousin. Fifth generation. Oh, what, you too? Hmm? [sighs] What happened to our tradition, Maria? Tradition? Like picking fruit for some white rancher? That tradition? Things change, William. We're changing. Look around. We're 26 in this village now. Tradition won't find her a husband. Okay. Enough, Maria. If you are going to remove this family weeks before we planned, you will wait until this family is ready to say goodbye. [car approaching] The Indian Agency woman. No, stay here. [car horn honks] You don't need another woman telling you what to do. Hey, I need peace between us. [sighs, scoffs] Bring us peace. [grunts] [engine turns off] [children] Candy, candy. Candy. [child] She has candy. Okay, settle down. That's not a way to welcome me. That's not a way to welcome me. [Child] I fall. What? I fell. Oh, I'm so sorry. You fell down? Would some candy make you feel better? What do you say? [children] Please. And? [children] Thank you. Yay! Thank you. You're leaving already. Harvest isn't for another month. Yes, that's true. Well, then, I came just in time. This was my mother's. She was fiery and passionate like you. So I wanted you to have it. Thank you. [child 1] Hurry, hurry. We have to catch him. Grandma said he's a desert runner. [child 2] He can go on for days. We'll never catch up to him. [child 1] How did he get there so fast? [distant shouting] Goddamn it! Get your hands off me, you fucking Philistine! [grunting] Don't move! [Toutain] Take him to jail to cool off. [screaming] Hyah! Take those to the other one. Good morning, Ticup. Miss True. I've brought some donations left over from the Malki Agency. I thought maybe you and your grandson would want some new clothes? Is Willie Boy in? He and I have never met each other, but Carlota speaks so fondly of him. I understand he spends most of his time in the desert, but I thought maybe he'd like a few of these things. I'll just leave them over here. Good day. [horse whinnies] [grunts] [gasps, grunts] Stopping early for ceremony tonight. [Carlota] Someone die? A man from Riverside. No one sung for him. Hey. What happened? I made a mistake. I just made some tincture. Go talk to your mother. [William] I want to say thank you. Thank you all for coming here today. You know, our creator... [speaks Chemehuevi] ...he gave us... [speaks Chemehuevi] ...the Salt Songs, to guide our spirits to the coyote who made the staircase into the Milky Way. The creator also gave us these songs to ease our suffering. But on the day that he was to deliver them to us, he warned us that he must first break our hearts. 'Cause this is how we learn those Salt Songs. [speaks Chemehuevi] And in suffering, we learn true happiness. In hearts that break, we find life, and in... [speaks Chemehuevi] ...we find the Salt Songs. [speaks Chemehuevi] [chanting in Chemehuevi] [chanting continues] [chanting fades] [William] Are you guys ready for a story? Okay, I want to tell you a story and warn you about the legendary John Hyde. He's the best tracker in the West. He's quiet as a mouse, but he's got the eyes of a hawk. You know what he did one time? He attacked the customs house in Nogales, killing several men. He got American militia, he got the Mexican infantry, Buffalo soldiers. Guess what. [child] What? Now he's taken refuge right here in the desert, and he's protecting me and you. But at night, sleep with one eye open. Because you know what John Hyde does? He sneaks around and eats little kids! [Hyde grunts] [chuckling] I'm just teasing. John Hyde is my friend. I scare you, huh? [child] Yeah. [William] That's good. I meant to scare you. Here. You're the chief now. Okay? You take over my spot. [children laughing] [Willie Boy imitates crow] [Maria whispers] Carlota! Carlota! [William] You going somewhere? Are they worth it, Carlota? Carlota. I want you to think about what you're doing. Carlota. [Maria] William. Carlota! [Maria] William, no more. No. No. I know he's out there. I said no more. Just leave her be. Leave her be, Maria? She's my daughter. She's my daughter too. William, you keep pushing her, you're only gonna push her further away. No. No, no. William! No, no. No. Carlota! Carlota! Carlota! A gun. What, you brought a gun to talk to me? You scared now? Where is she? Well, I was hoping that maybe... This what you came to do? Hmm? Then do it. Do it. Do it. Yeah. If you want to take her... [Carlota] Dad. ...you're gonna have to kill me. [Willie Boy] No. Please. Come on. Come on! No, no, no! Dad! No! [gunshot] [Maria] No! [gasping] What have you done? William. It was an accident. [Maria] William! Mama! Mama, no. I'm so sorry. [crying] Leave us. Mama? Leave us! [Sniffles] They'll be coming for you. Go! [sobbing] [panting] [crying] Please. Please. [coyote howls] [ho of beats approaching] Sheriff? Nope. This is his home. Oh, yeah. Where is he? Uh... [clears throat] on sabbatical. Can I help you? William was shot last night. He... He's dead. [sniffles] Your husband? Killed. [Sniffles] Oh, Jesus. He was a good man. Kept Indian trouble on Indian land. You're gonna have to talk to the tribal police. The man who shot my husband is with my daughter. Tribal police will kill him. You need to help her. The government gave you land and life outside our laws. You gotta talk to the tribal police. It's beyond our protection. My husband was shot on Gilman's ranch. That puts this in your jurisdiction. Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Why don't you go home? [sniffles] Just go on home. Mm-mmm. I'm not leaving until I see him. I'm sorry about the chief. [crying] I thought I told you to hide the liquor. He wouldn't listen to me. I tried to stop him. [whistles] Wake up, buddy. [groans] Frank? Oh, no. Reche. Put me down, Reche. I'm fine. [humming] ♪ I need Your sweet lo♪e [coughs] ♪ Each and every day ♪ ♪ Old mustang Sad♪e ♪ I love you like cra♪y ♪ I need you working In the kitch♪n Lookee here. ♪ One sweet love for you ♪ Come on, brother. Time to wake up. An Indian killed one of its own. Not our problem. Okay. It happened at Gilman's ranch. Gilman's ranch? Shit. [spitting] Brother. Brother, brother. We gotta get our shit together, man. Taft is coming to Riverside. Taft? Yeah. Some presidential jerk-off bullshit. Nobody's gonna like a manhunt, not while that's going on. Brother, we got a posse to mount. [water splashes] [drums beating] [rattles shaking] [Chemehuevi chanting] [chanting continues] Aren't they supposed to burn the body? Just his possessions. You did smart going to the sheriff. We'll make it right in the end. Will you? It smells a bone, it comes running. [Chuckles] Please tell me he's not riding out with us. Shut up. They don't need those men. I didn't ask them here to help you and Hyde find Willie Boy. They're here in case you do. [Reche] Big Jim, you stay here. Keep an eye on that town and a closer eye on the tribe. These kids might try to make their way back. You're gonna need more water. They'll be all right. I'm talking about the horses. You gonna let the bastard talk to you like that? Stop talking. [chanting continues] Pack of Sasquatches. Show some respect. Holy shit. You hearing this? What's gotten into you? I didn't ask you to speak. Enough. Enough. So don't speak. Nobody wants to hear lip from some wannabe savage raised on some white witch's tit. [groans] [Reche] Geez. Where'd that come from? You got a reckoning coming. Is that so, monkey boy? You sweet on Frank. That's why he keeps you around. "Sheriff, boys are waiti" on the word. She ain't talking, huh? [Frank] Come on. Let's go. [Toutain] See any tracks up there? [Ben] No. [Toutain] Kid threw us in a loop. Better than I thought. That horse do the same for you? Yeah, he would. Stupid. That horse looks thirsty. So does that one. Can someone please tell me how two two-footed redskins beat a posse of four-footed horsemen? Horses ain't got much left in 'em. We're gonna have to head back. I ain't following no desert dogs. [Reche] We need to find a place to pack up for the night. This place looks good. [Reche] Do they know something we don't? [Frank] I hope so. [harmonica playing] [humming] That Indian been watching us about an hour now. Never did give you my condolences for your wife, Frank. How you sleeping? Are you Hyde? Would be. Segundo. Frank Wilson. Um, that's, uh, Toutain on the rocks back there, and Reche, my tracker, and Knowlin on the harmonica. He's a utility. And Ben de Crevecoeur, um, he's just an asshole. We underestimated our time out here. Horses are thirsty. You know where there's water? Juniper Pond would be your best chance. Can you take us there? Yeah. Well, thank you. [Frank] Let's go. You trust old Crazy Horse up there? No. But until my tracker finds us some water, we don't got a choice. [horse whinnies] [blusters] Where's the water? Desert drank it up. Unbelievable. Fell for that one, Sheriff? Is there another source nearby? About a day's ride. [Ben] I knew it. You did this on purpose, you red back son of a bitch. Dragged us out here, no water, forcing us back so you can find them on your own. Ain't gonna work, though. No, sir. [Frank] Come on. [Reche] Where the hell you going? [Frank] Back. [Knowlin] Back? Back for supplies and water. We don't have a choice. What about them? Pack up what you need. Pick up our trail in Pipes Canyon. Frank, one of us needs to go with them and make sure they're not screwing us around. I'll go. [Knowlin] Not you. [Ben] I ain't following no redskin. I'll do it. No, to hell with it. I'll go. I get up to see this through, I'm gonna see it through. No horse. [Segundo] Two days. Pipes Canyon. [Ben] Right. Y'all better hurry. I'll have Willie Boy hog-tied and mounted time you get back. All right, chimmies. Show us what you got. You're like a couple of desert hound dogs, ain't you? [Laughs] [howls] [Knowlin laughs] [Hyde speaks Chemehuevi] Knowlin don't stand a chance. [exhales] [ho of beats approaching] Gentlemen! [horse whinnies] [guns cocking] It's just a camera. Wanted to ask you a few questions about Willie Boy. You got a comment for the paper, Sheriff? We leave in the morning. Oh. Anything else? No. [crickets chirping] [chattering] Newspaperman. Mr. Randolph Madison. So what's a newspaperman doing out in this goddamn sandbox? I'm gonna need a story. I got one for you. Here you go. The marks in the dirt sayin' he proddin' her on like a stray heifer, probably with a loaded rifle to her back. We was close too. Heard her crying, moaning. How's that for a story? You can read the whole thing tomorrow. Already have, Mr. Crevecoeur. Great story. Willie Boy is gonna be everyone's worst nightmare. Ah. Fear really is the best kind of candy. The thing is... Well... What? You lack a grand ending. Oh, that's coming. I assure you, Mr. Randolph, that's coming. When? [sighs] You see, it's a matter of perspective. You gave us a great villain in Willie Boy. But who's the hero? Oh, is it Sheriff Wilson? The drunk who couldn't even save his wife from a rusty blade. He, our hero? Or is it someone else? Maybe it's a man whose family was evicted by US troops when the Malki Reservation was established. A man who one day might be... Should be sheriff. My story will need a hero. What's your angle, Mr. Randolph? We'll plug you in every paper across these deserts until news burns across California state lines. The worse Willie Boy gets, the better you sound. Papers gonna fly off these shelves. I will ask again. What's in it for you? I need Sheriff Wilson to bring me along. It's the only way the story's getting written. [sighs] And, well, it's the only way that I get to get out of this goddamn sandbox. [inhales, exhales] There's more of these along the way. All the way to Nevada. Hey, Frank. I got an idea. Why don't you give your horse your house? Then you can have your horse's stall all to yourself. Mm-hmm. Sheriff? Where the fuck did you come from? A moment of your time, Sheriff? My name is Randolph Madison. I'm with the Banning Daily. No, no, no. Get him out of here. Why? He put our story on the front page. Publication's making us look stupid. Us stupid? You, maybe. All due respect, Sheriff, but there's a murderous Indian on the loose and we are days away from President Taft from riding into Riverside. That's a lot at stake here, sir. Uh-huh. Sheriff, if you all come back again with nothing, the people will soon become scrutinizing and judgmental and unsupportive. People will think that you can't do the job, Sheriff. And we can't have the public turn on us. Us? Like he's saying. How you gonna help us? Huh? Fear, Mr. Reche. Huh? Think about it, Sheriff. If people are afraid of what it means to have Willie Boy on the loose, they will rally behind us no matter how long it takes to bring him in. [Randolph] With no story, no fear. The public will think that it's you that can't do the job, Sheriff, and then there'll be queries as to why. And, Sheriff, well, word around town is that one shouldn't dig too deep into your past. You son of a bitch! Hey, whoa, whoa. Come on, Reche. What's your fucking game, Randolph? Do that again! What's your game, brother? Wanna tell me? Get off! [Frank] Enough. No games. I need you for a story, and you need me to buy you time. It's all we got. All right, Mr. Madison. Okay. Back to work. Hey, Ben, you have anything to do with this? Nope. How'd he know where to find us? [objects clattering] Let's get to it. [Knowlin coughs] Don't you chimmies ever need a break? [Knowlin coughs] A box. Lunch. I can't... Son of a bitch! [birds chirping] You okay? I'm fine. Do you think anyone's following us? No, I don't think so. [Knowlin coughing] [coughs, groans] [coughing] [grunts] [panting] Let's go. [panting] Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. [Toutain] There he is. [Grunting] Ah, Jesus. [Reche] Water! Hurry up! [coughing] [Frank] Make some room. In the back. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Knowlin. We got you. [Reche grunting] [Knowlin coughs] [Ben] Indians are right over there just looking at him. This way. Get him in the wagon. Come on. [Frank] The trackers are coming with us. We'll sleep here tonight. Animals will come to drink. We can trap some food. Shouldn't we keep moving? If anyone's following us, they'll be a day behind. We're okay. [fire crackling] Segundo. Hmm? Why are you here? [inhales, exhales] Bring Carlota home. Only Carlota? Yeah. Beans are bubbling. I thought them Indians left me for dead. Then I heard the wagon. They knew. [Knowlin] That's why I'm still alive. Why? Because they're good people. Mr. Toutain, I heard from Reche that you... that you grew up on an Indian reservation. You sympathize with the Indian? [Ben] He preaches to 'em. Why don't you just paint your face red, join their damn team, for Christ's sake. Who are the savages? Indian lovin' don't make you smart, Toutain. Makes you a fool's preacher. [rustling] [groans] [inhales, exhales] Good morning. Meat's a bit tough. [chuckles] [hissing] [screams] Carlota! [gasps] No. [breathing shakily] Let me see, let me see... Oh. It'll be okay. Just breathe. There's a good chance it's a dry bite. There's a hunter's cabin not far ahead. There should be some supplies, maybe some medicine. Don't panic. It will just make it worse. Come on, come on. Let's go. You know why the Chemehuevi burn the possessions of the ones who've died? It rids them of their attachments and lets the spirit run free. I know my sister's death haunts you, Frank. But maybe we're the ones haunting her... holding on the way we do. Eat something. Hey, sir. Load up. We're gonna head over to Garth's place. There's a well there. Ten minutes. [Reche] Yes, boss. Morning. [grunts] The thing is, my men and I are here to bring that boy in alive. So if you're here on some sort of vendetta, that's liable to complicate things. You hear me? I will find him, and you're welcome to every piece of him when I'm done. You hear me? What's a Yaqui doing with the Chemehuevi? I hoped William would take you in... [sighs] ...make you forget about all the horrible things that you've seen. But peace doesn't follow death, does it? Booze does. [Segundo] You, move. Ah, Jesus. [groans] You want some more water? This cabin. It's like Pahrump. A cabin with a view. [ho of beats approaching] [Frank] Toutain, keep an eye on them. Reche, head on up. [Toutain] There's a trail around the north side. Looks like they picked up something. [Reche] I'm on it. You holding up? [sighs] I'm done. [Reche] I'm seeing some tracks over here. Get that camera loaded. [grunting] [Reche exhales] Son of a bitch. [Toutain] Well's busted. He broke the damn handle. [Randolph] Can you fix it? [Toutain] Hell, no. How long? A matter of hours. [Ben] We gotta stop dicking around and end this. Stop talking. [Segundo] The trail leads to a place we know. It'll push the horses, but there's water. [Ben] You ain't leading us to water, are you? You're just wearing them horses out. Am I? Yeah, you are. Your horses carry the scent of death not because of me. It's because you wander around this desert like a bunch of children. [grunts] Y'all gonna let him draw on me? I told you to stop talking. Put it down, Hyde. It's gonna make a mess for everyone. [speaks Chemehuevi] Take the wagon back with Knowlin. I ain't leaving. Yeah, you are. And take the ink pusher with you. You're losing control here, Sheriff. It's only a matter of time before this posse rides with someone else. Randolph, let's go. [beeping] [typewriter keys clacking] [typewriter bell dings] We got the end. Read it from "an unnamed source." "An unnamed source told posseman Ben de Crevecoeur that Willie Boy consumed two bottles of demon water before he killed William in his sleep and kidnapped his 16-year-old daughter." She's 14. But you said 16. Well, now she's 14. We are selling fear, Mr. Randolph, are we not? I like your style, Mr. Ben. De Crevecoeur. It's French. "And kidnapped his 14-year-old daughter." Mr. Ben De Crevecoeur warns that there are rumors of an Indian insurgence "that may be mounting in the desert." [grunts] The rest is good. Print it. Did they sing salt for William? I don't know. We gotta go. Soon. [inhales, exhales] I need medicine. What? Your grandma. She must have something to help. No. I can't leave you here like this. I need medicine. [sniffles] Will you go? Okay. [sighs] I love you, boy. Okay. I'll go. [sniffles] I love you. [sniffles] [crying] [Ticup speaking Chemehuevi] [person screams] [hammer clicks] Rebecca? There's someone out there. Stay back. Willie Boy. Where is Carlota? She's sick. Snake bite. She needs medicine. I had nowhere else to go. Go get the medicine. You can take what you need. Sheriff Wilson has a posse mounted. Been tracking you since Banning. Thank you. [horse blusters] [crows cawing] [gun hammer clicks] We're getting close, right? We'll bring that boy in. But I need him alive. It's the law, John. I've known men like you. Lawmen enforcing your laws on foreign land. I am tired of it. If you shoot that boy... I'll put you down. [gun clicks] No. I don't think so. You've had your fill of death. I can see it in your eyes. Smell it on you. [crow caws] Go to hell, Willie Boy. [gun hammer clicks] This is not the way. Better make it quick. I got a clean shot. [Frank] You sure it's him? Oh, I am. [gunshot] [Toutain] Seen him? [Ben] Who? [Toutain] The boy. Have you seen Frank? Fired? I heard a shot. [panting] [Hyde] No. [Hyde breathing heavily] [Reche] This way! [sobbing] [sobbing] [Reche] Willie Boy, no. Oh, hell. [Reche] You can say that again. That son of a bitch killed her. [Reche] Willie. [Sniffles] I knew he would. You take that picture, I'll take your head. Mr. Madison, you're gonna go back on the wagon with Hyde. The rest of us, mount up. Segundo, we could use the help. [humming] [humming continues] How does it feel? First time on a horse. [horses whinny] [Frank] Get him! [gunshot] He's right up there. He just ducked under them rocks right there. Hyah! Hyah! Willie Boy! [horse whinnies] Shit. [Toutain] We'll find him. Sheriff, you shouldn't be here. Forgive me. [horse whinnies] [Frank] Fall back! [Reche] Where is he? [Ben] Straight up! [Reche] Hang in there, Toutain. [Ben] He's up top! [Reche] Spread out. Spread out! [Toutain] Get up against the rocks. [Reche] Hang in there, Toutain! Bring him out! [Ben] He's got to come down! [horse shrieks] [Toutain] Right there. [Frank] Toutain, get clear. [Ben] He's up on them rocks! [Reche] Come on! [Ben] Return fire! [Reche] He's running west. [Ben] Shoot him! [Reche] Get him! Get him! [Ben] Shoot him! [Reche] Goddamn it! Who's got eyes on him? [gunshot] [horse whinnies] [Ben grunts] [Reche] Ben! [Reche] Back in the canyon! [Reche groans] [Toutain] Clear out! [Segundo] He's gunning for the horses. Not us. You can write that on your tombstone, not mine. [shouting, groaning] Where you going? Stop moving! Stop! Stop it, Toutain! Damn it! Get back here! [groans] Frank? Never trust an enemy. Where you going? Fuck you up. Sheriff. Sheriff! Willie Boy! Willie Boy! Carlota's dead. Hyde tracked you to Pipes Canyon. We found her body by the rocks. Her body's going back to Banning. If you turn yourself in... you can have your proper goodbyes. [breathing heavily] [Frank] She's dead. She's dead. [gun clicks] [footsteps approaching] Couldn't find a way to the top. [Segundo] I didn't see him. What do you want to do? [sighs] We go home. Sheriff. Sheriff! We go home. [horse groans] [groans] [gunshot] [sighs] [door opens] Doc says you're gonna be just fine. As long as he keeps giving me this shit. [Chuckles] Oh, Frank. Why did we go after that boy for? What do you mean? [chuckles] Justice. We're the law. Ain't no one of us went after that boy for justice, Frank. [sighs] Least of all me. Oh, Frank, we made a mess. We really made a mess. [crying] Oh, Frank. [snorts] Oh, yeah, I forgot. Um... My vest pocket. I got something for you. Where did it go? Frank. Drinkin' ain't gonna bring her back, brother. [singing, slurring words] [Reche continues singing, fades] [Ben] I thought for sure he shot himself up here. Damn coward. [Randolph] Uh... wh-what now? [Ben] We track him down. [scoffs] We couldn't catch him when he had a day's jump on us. He's damn near five away now. What are you seein', Jim? What if it was suicide? Duh. There's no body. Obviously ain't here for your brains, Cochise. His body would be too bloated to move. He'd just tear apart. Whoa, whoa. Come on. What we doing here, Frank? It's over. [Ben] The hell it is. We can't go back with nothing. Camera. What are you doing? [Frank] Jim, lay down. [Ben] No. No, no, no. You're gonna let that Indian win. You're saying he beat us. You sure about this? No one's gonna see that boy again. He's either dead or dead inside. We're chasing a ghost. [Ben] No one's gonna believe us without seeing a goddamn head. No one! [Randolph] I'll sell it. People want it to end. We'll give it to them. One photo, I got my ticket out of this hellhole, and you will return home as saints. You robbing us of our victory here, Sheriff, and God help me, everyone gonna know what... [laughs] You gotta learn to shut up. Now get in the picture or don't get in the picture. I don't care. Where do you want me? Right there. [Randolph] More guns. On your side. Okay, this is a long exposure, so don't move. Don't move. [Randolph] Well, smile, for Christ's sakes. You're heroes. We got it. [Frank] Thank you, Mr. Madison. You can hitch a ride with Ben here, and both of you can get the hell out of my sight. [Ben] How long to get that picture developed? [Big Jim] Boys. Enough? Enough.
