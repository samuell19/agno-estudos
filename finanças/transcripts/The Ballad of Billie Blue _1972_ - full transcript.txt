CHILDREN'S CHOIR [SINGING]: There's a church in the valley by the wildwood. No lovelier spot in the dale. No place is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale. Come to the church in the wildwood. Oh, come to the church in the dale. No place is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale. There's a church in the valley by the wildwood. No lovelier spot in the dale. No place is so dear to my childhood as the little brown church in the vale. Come to the church in the wildwood. Oh, come to the church in the dale. [music playing] WOMAN [SINGING]: This is the Ballad of Billy Blue. Some say it happened. Most say it is true. You be the judge as we unfold the ballad of Billy Blue. He was a young man filled with pride. Left for his future, his buddy by his side. Two close friends who went on their way, the ballad of Billy Blue. Then he started singing and playing his guitar, most of the time for free. But still people listened and wanted to hear more, so on his way was he. Soon he was famous, a singing star. Traveled the country, singing out his heart. People would stand and cheer his songs-- the ballad of Billy Blue. Then something happened, and things went wrong. His wife had left him with nothing but his song. He went to drink before every show-- the ballad of Billy Blue. His friend tried to help him straight out his life. Tried to convince him, forget about his wife. His career slowly went astray-- the ballad of Billy Blue. He even went to prison to protect his wife, there faced such misery. While in prison, he listened to a man and found security. Now he is free and has learned to believe. He read a book that everyone should read. He found the answer to a brand new life-- the ballad of Billy Blue. [music playing] [applause] EMCEE: Well, this is the long-awaited night for all of us. [applause] [SINGING] A world of joy, a giant toy that you never really played with. A path to climb, so little time someone to share the way with. So many dos, too many don'ts. A game that must be tried. A time of need, so much to be. All this has been my life. A dream of is born. And the legend grows, and then turns into nothing. That silent scream, someone must see it's not too late for something. It's more important than a rose. Much bigger than the sky. And yet so small, it's touched by all. Yes, this has been my life. And I'm awfully wise if I realize what a precious, precious gift life is. I can't believe I'm really me. I feel so much, yet nothing. I stand sometimes with friends of mine. I reach, but I can't touch them. Alone I stand, yet hand in hand. I share both joy and strife. A time of good that's understood because it's been my life. [applause] You were fantastic tonight, Billy. You really were. Thank you, Reba. Good night. Good night, May. Good night, Al. Good night, Reba. I'm going to check on the car. Catch you later. CARL: Hey Al, baby. Billy boy, we did it. We did it. We had a great night, a fantastic night. I don't know about the song you sang, whether it's the best song or not, but I'll tell you one thing-- we got 5 million new fans. Lou Shore, he wants to make a record deal with us-- our own record company. Do you believe that? Hey, hey, what's the matter? You're not dressed. We're going to Abe Bloom's house. He's giving a big party for us-- a barrel of booze for everybody. Look, I don't think I'll be going, Carl. I'm tired. Maybe some other time. Some other time? You got to be kidding. Billy, it's in your honor. Abe Bloom does not go around giving parties just for anybody. He wants to talk a three-picture deal with us, and that means money, kid. Big money. Besides, the part is just an excuse to get you together with Al Hart about his new musical. I know, honey. I thought we could just pick up some food and go home, and be together. Nobody goes home on an award night. Look, I don't care what night it is, Carl. I'm tired, man. I've been on my tour for the last four months, sleeping in fleabag hotels and ratholes and eating out of slop joints. Now I'm tired, man. I'd like to spend one night at home alone with May and the baby. Look, just one night before I start out again. [chuckling] You're, uh, you're really crazy, kid. I think you're really crazy, eh? MAY: Come on, sugar. We won't stay long. Please? We'll just have a few drinks, hm? A few laughs? No, May. All right, Mr. Blue. Go get your little hamburger and malt and go home. Go home and live it up! But I won't be with you, chum. I haven't spent all this time with you to walk away from tonight. Look, May. Don't May me! I've waited too long for this moment, Big Daddy. Now if you want to sit around and miss out on the good times, that is fine. But don't expect anyone else to. If you've got the guts to take me, darling, I am ready to go. I, uh-- I'm warning you, May, don't go. Just don't go. And just what are you going to do about it if I do? Hm? Uh, don't worry about it, Billy. I'll, uh, I'll take care of her. Oh, you do that, Carl. [music playing] Here. That's for your trouble. Thanks, sport. Now when you want some action, another babysitter, call me, will you? Yeah, sure. Mr. Tripp. Seems you lost a fan, Billy? Lost a fan. Well, you never had one, sewer mouth. What are you doing here anyway? Counting bad news about poor country folk? I wasn't aware that you were poor. WAITRESS: Victor? Here, Sugar. You ought to get one of this-- Mr. Billy Blue slopped to the eyeballs. [screaming] [chatter] Come on, Harve. Are you all right, Harvey? Yeah, Joe, I'll handle this. Hey, quiet down, everyone. It's gonna be all right. Enjoy yourselves. [music playing] OK, boys, let's call it, uh, a draw. No more fighting in here. Billy, you ought to know better. Drunk or not, you can hit, Billy. I'm sure all your fans would love to have a picture of you stinking drunk. Give me that. [screaming] Just let go! Get me a double scotch and put it Mr. Blue's check. Come on to the office, Harvey. We'll fix that cut. I want to talk to you. I'll be seeing you, Billy. Be sure and read our next issue. All right, just relax. Take it easy. Why did that have to happen? Man, that stuff ain't getting it. Could you give me a couple of them pills? Hey, man, cool it. Look, that reporter's no buddy of ours. As a matter of fact, I think you just made an enemy out of a bad friend. And these ain't no aspirin. On top of that booze, they'll bomb you right out of your mind. That's what I want. I just bombed. We don't wish to, as you say, slander your client, Mr. Blue. But we do owe our readers the truth about their idols. Mr. Oliver, you and I both know very well, and especially Mr. Tripp, that one can slant the printed word. Now, I don't ask you not to print Mr. Tripp's article. I'm only asking that you state in it that Billy Blue has been on a long and strenuous tour, that he's very tired from all of his record dates and personal appearances, and at the time he was not responsible for the acts which you have here in these photographs. In other words, give us a break. Listen, Reba, you're not fooling anybody, and neither is Blue. He's a pillhead and a drunk. That's not true, Harvey. He's been sick. That's all. No, I don't want to hear it. Billy's not that down-home corn-pone collard green boy that rode out on a freight and became the idol of country-western. But I'll make a deal with you. I want to know what makes Billy tick. I want to know the truth about those rumors that keep flying around about him. In other words, I want an exclusive, intimate, inside story about Mr. Billy Blue. Now wait a minute, Harvey. He's not going to like that at all, and especially since it's you. You two have been scrapping with each other for a long time. He might refuse even if I ask. Reba, I'll let you review everything I write about him. It might even help you with your plea. But if Billy refuses, we'll not only print this story and these pictures, but I'll dog him till I nail him. That's blackmail, Harvey. Take it or leave it, Miss Stone. Well, I think your traveling and being with us Mr. Tripp will be kind of a trip, not to mention the great publicity we'll be getting in your magazine, right, Billy? Look, Carl, I've already agreed he could go, but let's get one thing straight. Harvey here don't like me any, and baby, I assure you there's no love lost on this side, either. So let's just stop all this phony routine back and forth, all right? If you want to kiss his behind, you kiss it all you want, but don't expect me to go with you. Billy. You promised. I'm sorry, Reba. I just don't like this idea of meddling in my private life. It's all I've got. But I'm stuck with it. So when you crows are through picking me and laying it out, well, you let me know, because right now I'm taking my daughter for a pony ride. [chuckling] Hush now, sugar. You and Momma fight all the time. Don't you love each other anymore? Sure we do, sugar. Can't we ever have fun anymore? [crying] Cathy-- [music playing] We used to have fun. Didn't we? [music playing] [cheering] That'll put the syrup on your pancakes and the cream in your coffee. The man y'all have been saving your egg money to see, the one and only, the king, that man himself, Mr. Billy Blue. [cheering] That man himself, Mr. Billy Blue. [cheering] Oh, sorry about that, [inaudible]. Hey, hey, what's going on? Could you give me a hand? There we go. Don't put it on my head. [cheering] [laughter] Thank you, old buddy. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Billy Blue. Wait a minute. Come here. Come here. Come here. Let's say hello to the people, OK? Ev-- what's your name? Don't tell me, tell the people Look at this. He hasn't been sober in three weeks. BILLY: Everybody say hello to Duke. He's blown the last eight dates we have. The owners want their money back. The fans are walking out in the middle of the performance. The bookers are frantic. They're threatening to sue. Thank you, old buddy. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Billy Blue. I'll do the same for you, [inaudible]. He's out of his mind. He's crazy. Stick around. He may get better later in the evening. Shh. [laughter] Shh. I can't help it, Hoss. I haven't stolen a pig since I was 10 years old. Well, listen, if you don't cut out all that sniggering and giggling, we ain't gonna steal one. All we're gonna get is a load of buckshot. [laughter] Quit rattling your mouth and come on. [laughter] I don't see why we don't just buy one anyway. [laughter] Shh. [coughing] Shh. [coughing] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. [coughing] [inaudible] [coughing] [laughter] Come on, come on, don't worry about nothing. [squealing] AL: Come on. Come on. Get back in that [inaudible]. Pen 'em in. A-ha. Get that big one, I think. AL: No, let's get the little one. Why? [laughter] Let's get the little one. [laughter] OK. OK. Get him out. Get him out of there. Get him out of there. [laughter] [squealing] [laughter] [squealing] Bring him around this way. Bring him this way. -I got him. Bring him this way. [squealing] AL: There he is. There he is. I got him. Get the bag. Get the bag. Get the bag. Get the bag, Billy! Come on, Billy! Right here. Get him. Hold him up. Hold him up. Put the sack open. [squealing] [gasping] Put the sack open, Billy! BILLY: Wait a minute. [laughter] [squealing] AL: Aw, you let him go. There we go. Woo! Oh, Billy. -Hold on. -Come on Billy. -Hold on. Put the sack open. [laughter] Put the sack open. [laughter] Come on, Billy. [laughter] Come on, Billy. Pick him way up. Pick him way up. He's heavy. [squealing] Billy, get him in the sack. Get him in the sack. Get him in the sack. Woo! Get him in the sack. Woo! [panting] OK. Hold up. Wait a minute. [panting] Hang on to him. You'd better catch [inaudible]. Oh! Get the other-- catch the front. I'll get him. You go to the fence. OK. OK. Hurry up. [panting] AL: Oh, lord. Woo! Come on, Billy. BILLY: Wait a minute. AL: Hey. Hey. Come on, let's get out of here. [squealing] AL: Is he heavy? Get up, Billy. This thing must weigh a ton. AL: It don't weigh a ton. It's the liquor you've been drinking. Come on. Hey, what've we got here, a party? CROWD: Yeah! We promised y'all a prize, right? CROWD: Right! All right. Al? Hm? [laughter] Let the bacon out. [scream] [squealing] [screaming] [music playing] [knocking] Mr. Blue, please. Stop this noise. The whole motel is complaining. [crashing] [knocking] Mr. Blue, please stop this racket right now. Woo hoo! [screaming] [music playing] AL: Woo hoo! [squealing] [screaming] [music playing] Sure is a hell of a party. Oh. Yes, uh-- you know, you're cute. What's your name? Oh, well. See you. [music playing] Well now, ain't this something. I knew I'd find you here. Now listen, uh, Billy, I don't-- Just shut your mouth, flesh peddler, and pack your things and get out. You're through. Billy, I really don't know how to-- I said get out! [screaming] Calm down, don't hit him! Don't hit him, Carl. [screaming] Stop! [screaming] Stop. Please don't hit him. [screaming] [screaming] Get out! Out! [screaming] [glass breaking] [thump] [gasping] You-- killed him! [screaming] Oh, no! [gasping] [SCREAMING]: I killed him! [gasping] New York Times, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, London Gazette, Louisville Sun-Times. You sure did it, Harvey. You scooped the whole damn country, even your own byline. Just put it in my check, Pappy. Now, I think this should be good for at least two or three followups for the magazine-- prison stuff, family, you know. Let's see, on the cover, we'll feature the-- No, Ron, forget it. RON: What's the matter? No follow-ups. What do you mean? You got the hottest story of the year and you're not bird dogging it? What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? I don't think he did it. Who cares? He pleaded guilty. We can increase our circulation a quarter of a million. I don't give a damn about your circulation. I think he got a bum deal. I think he's covering up for his wife, and now that it's over, I kind of feel sorry, and I like the kid. So forget it, Ron. Bury it. Bury it. Ha! That's a new one. The vulture falling in love with his meal. You want me to throw up now? Listen, you two-bit reporter, this story is worth $100,000 to this magazine, and before I pass up that kind of cash, I'd smear him all over the wall. Bury it. You bet I'll bury it. Right in his head. And you would, too, because you're nothing. You're a lousy piece of nothing. [glass breaking] I quit! Quit? You're fired! You hear? Fired! [door slams] Billy Blue faces prison term for manslaughter. Famed country western singer Billy Blue was found guilty in the voluntary manslaughter of his agent, Carlton Jacobs, by the jury in Anderson County, and the judge sentenced him to three years at hard labor. 10 minutes, Blue. Hi. Hate for you to mess up that pretty little face, sugar. I'm sorry. I always was a cry baby. [inaudible]. AL: How you doing, old buddy? I could sure use one of them big steaks from down at Smokey Joe's in Louisville. You wouldn't be in here if you hadn't pleaded guilty. How is May? AL: Disappeared. The baby? Well, she's fine. Look, the folks took her home. We would've brought her-- No, um, I'm glad you didn't. I mean, I wouldn't want her to see me in something like this. You know, she's divorcing you, Billy. I know. AL: And taking everything. I know. Look, I-- I told my lawyer-- I mean, May and I made-- made this deal. But you can fight her. I don't want to fight her, Al. I mean, she gave the baby to my folks. And I told her that she could have everything else. I mean, it's nothing but money anyway, man. If you'd just let me wring her little rotten neck a little, I'll tell her how she really happened. Maybe. Do you think it would do any good? Maybe not. But I sure'd get me some satisfaction. You're the best-- the best friend a guy could ever have. I mean, you're more than anybody could ever ask for. [crying] And Reba, I wish so much that things could've been different. [door opens] OK, Blue. Hey, would you guys do me a favor? [crying] Would you-- [crying] Would you take care of Cathy for me? [crying] All right, let's move. All right, Blue. Hand out them tools. Coming out, boss. All right. Call out. All right, let's get it on. We ain't got all day to hoe this patch. REBA [VOICEOVER]: Your mom and your pop are well. And we all send our love to you, Billy. Love, Reba. One of these days I'm gonna sprout me some wings and fly away from this place. Justin, you keep on running every time they take those chains off you, and that's gonna be a lot sooner than you think about those wings. Yeah, I know. But I just can't help it. It ain't so bad in the daytime. But at night, when everything is quiet, them crickets clacking out there like everything, I lay there in that bunk and I get to thinking of that gal of mine back in Oak River, and man, oh, man. Yeah. I know. Things sure are a lot different when you ain't there. Man, you ain't got no worry. You're getting out soon on parole. Yeah. I am so sick of this "coming out, boss. Coming in, boss. Yes, sir, boss." [laughter] "No sir, boss." Boss this and boss that. Kind of gets to your guts after a couple of years. Man, it ain't so hard. I've had 10 years of it and 10 more to go. Justin, if I had 10 years to go, I'd probably be running right along with you. Tell me, Billy, what are you going to do the first minute you get out of here, huh? [laughter] I don't know, man. [laughter] Huh? [car] Hello there. Hi, John. All right, preacher. I'd like to say a couple of words to the men if it's all right with you. Yeah, that's all right. All right, men, let's listen up here! Now this here is a new preacher. . He's got a few words he wants to say to you. I don't think you ought to be out here, preacher. I think you ought to keep it to the church. No offense, John. This is my church. Thanks anyway. All right men, let's gather around. Men, you may not believe this, but I'm here to offer you some life assurance at no cost. [laughter] You fellows think I'm putting you on. I'm not. This is a plan that none of you can afford to ignore. It's a plan that begins paying benefits even before maturity. This is the plan. It's God's plan for your life. And in these pages, you will meet the planner, Jesus Christ, who together with the Father and the Holy Spirit have already put together your eternal life assurance plan. Now men, one of the most priceless gifts that one man can give to another is this holy word of G-- Hey! Break these chains and I'll join your outfit right now, preacher. Very good, my friend. Name's Bob. What's yours? Moses. And I'm stuck in bondage. Moses, look, trusting God is gut real. It's not making any promises or breaking any chains. It's saying look, Lord-- I told you man, the chains-- the chains. And the name is Justin, stupid. Not Moses. OK, Justin. You want to be free physically. I can't do anything about that. But I can show you how to become spiritually free, if you'll just use this tool. You got a hacksaw under your coat? BOB: No. I've got a sharper tool right here in my hand. It's forged with love and understanding. It's sharper than any hacksaw. Get off my back, Jack. You're bugging me. BOB: Good. Then I know you'll read it. It won't take you long. You'll be done in no time. Time? What do you know about time? I spent 10 years in these chains, man. That's time. 10! Hey, do me a favor. Go to hell. [music playing] Freeze! Freeze! [music playing] [chatter] Freeze! Freeze! [gunshot] [inaudible] Coming out. No more violence. We had enough. Come on, Justin. Come on. Get the hell away from me, preacher. I'm not buying your crap about God, love and freedom or your stupid Bible, or anything else! All forms of violence are wrong. The son of man didn't agree with violence, either. You may want to be physically free. I can't do anything about that. I told you that. But I can offer you the solution to your problem. It's a flesh and blood relationship to Jesus Christ. That's what it is. Now, this Sunday, if the sun's shining like today, we'll hold services out in the courtyard. We'll talk about a Jesus kind of love. Take over, John. You know, if they had a Jesus kind of love, you'd be unemployed. Come on, Billy. That's your name, isn't it, Billy? Yes sir. Thank you. All right, let's move on back to the truck. This ain't no Sunday picnic. [crickets] [music playing] [SINGING]: Try to forget what she looked like. Try to forget her name. Try to forget that you loved her, 'cause to her it was all a game. Try to forget your sorrow. Try to forget the pain. And look for-- That boy sure can sing. Hate to see him go. BILLY [SINGING]: 'cause the sun always-- I remember down in Nashville about three-- mm, four years ago, me and Minnie was visiting some folks. Went to the Ol' Opry one Saturday night. Spent my last $8 to see him. Yes, sir, that was better than giving her a new fur coat. And walk down the road of your future. It's right around the bend. Try to forget your sorrow. Try to forget the pain. And look for a better tomorrow, 'cause the sun always follows the rain. [music playing] Play, Billy, play. Louder. [music playing] Yeah, I gotta make my rounds before I turn in. I'll see you in the morning. [music playing] My passport, Blue boy. Don't be a fool, Weeks. They're bound to get you. Yeah, maybe. But I got the itch, man. You know what I mean. Thanks for the song. Keep playing. Keep playing. Maybe I'll run into you sometime, huh? BILLY: Hey. Goodbye, buddy, and good luck. [music playing] JOHN: All right, Blue. Knock it off. Yes sir, boss. [music playing] [music playing] Hey, boy, hold on there! Halt! [gunshot] [music playing] [train] [train whistle] [church bells] And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this, the judgment, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. And onto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. Amen. Amen. [music playing] [church bells] Billy. I'd like to thank you for fixing it so I can be out here today. I'm glad I could help, Billy. How do you feel? It's such a waste. I mean, why? BOB: I wish I could've spent more time with him. What could you have done for him? Maybe nothing, but once you leave this earth, Billy, it's too late. I can't do anything for Justin anymore. Maybe you and I can talk. Maybe I can offer some thoughts that might help. Thoughts? Thoughts ain't gonna bring back anybody, or Justin either. No, but thoughts lead to prayer, and prayer leads to understanding. And then we'll know the whys. Sounds confusing to me. Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, Billy? Yeah. OK. Do you believe that Jesus Christ suffered and died and was buried, and third day, he rose again from the dead and ascended into heaven? Do you believe all that, Billy? Yeah. All right. I don't want to put you down, but even the devil believes that much. The difference is, Billy, he doesn't think it matters. So the question now is, did Jesus Christ die for Billy Blue? Do you believe that? I ain't prayed since I was a little kid. What have you got to lose? I don't know. What do you do, just talk? Yeah, like-- like he was right here in front of us. Just talk to him. You want me to say some words, and then you say them after me? Yes. Let's sit down. Lord Jesus, I need you. Lord Jesus, I need you. I open my heart. I open my heart. And receive you as my savior and lord. BILLY: And receive you as my Savior and Lord. Thank you for forgiving my sins. Thank you for forgiving my sins. Take control of my life. Take control of my life. And make me the kind of person you want me to be. And make me the kind of person you want me to be. Amen. Amen. AL: We got together in a meeting and came to this conclusion. And so the guys agreed to form a group with me as the manager. Our first gig was a blast. You know, I think we got them booked for the summer already. That's great, Al. What'd you call the group, anyway? The Bluegrass Boys. Now ain't that cute? [laughter] Yeah. It's better than the Coon Holler Backwash. Hey, come on, man, I'm really happy for you. [laughter] Hey, maybe Reba can help you on the recording companies and the club owners. Hey, yeah. Hi, Billy, Al. Harvey. Long time. What are you doing, snooping or socializing? Come on, Al. What can we do for you, Harvey? A few bars, a few chains? Thanks, but no thanks. Just thought I'd stop by to see how you're doing. Heard you're getting out soon. Oh, yeah, he's a big-time reporter now-- newspaper, Louisville Times. He might even want to put your picture in the paper. What happened to the magazine? I kissed her goodbye. Oliver wanted some follow-ups on you. Well, we all have to graduate. I'd like to help you if I can. A little late, aren't you? I mean, you had your chance a long time ago. Knock it off, Al. That's OK, Billy. I guess I deserve that. Let's forget the past. I want to write your story. I want people to know your point of view, the truth about you, how you feel. I appreciate that, Harvey. But who cares? Billy, don't you realize there are a million people waiting to hear about you, good or bad? How do you think a rag like Scandal magazine gets such a high circulation? People like bad news, and you are bad news. I could write those articles in such a way that they'd end up cheering. After all, I'd just tell them the truth. No. Thank you, but no. I just don't want to dig up any old graves. I know what you're saying, and you can slug me if you want to, but if you're talking about May, you're crazy. After what she did to you? I know, Harvey. Look, let's just forget it, OK? Well, I tried. If you're in Louisville, come on by. We'll split a bottle. After all, I feel I owe you a couple. Billy, there's one thing I'd like to say. I can't forget the smut and smear articles I wrote about people. But now I've got a chance to be on the other side. Good luck, Billy. So long, Harvey. So long, Al. [laughter] Well, what do you know? The leopard has changed his spots. Yeah. I guess if a guy wanted to find somebody, he'd be a good man to look up. Yeah, OK. [car] What's going on? [inaudible] Man, where have you been? I've been waiting here for almost an hour. Man, I tried in every way I could, but the whole family wanted to come. Finally convinced your mom and dad that they couldn't go. Then Reba took the keys, said she wouldn't give them back unless she could go. Well, I convinced her that somebody had to stay with Cathy. Cathy doesn't know you were coming here. No, she just wanted a ride. Well, so do I. Get this crate moving. I've had enough of this place. Yes, sir, boss. Yes, sir, boss. [laughter] [music playing] Hey, Mr. Stackitt! Hello, Stackitt. Does Cathy know that I've been in prison yet? No. Reba's had you on a singing tour. You've had a fantastic trip. Yeah, she would. From now on, I'm telling her the truth. No more lies. Heard anything about May? Oh, Billy. I mean, has she tried to see Cathy? Nope. Not even a phone call. Look, Billy, you just spent a long time in that prison back there because you had a hook in your belly for that broad. You got a lot of fine people waiting for you back at home. What do you want to go looking for trouble for? I love you like a brother, Al. But I didn't ask for your advice. Just where is May? OK, brother. I'll tell you what I know, but it ain't pretty. Harvey Tripp ran into her a couple of weeks ago in Louisville. She's blown all the money she's taken from you. She's busted, man. Well, how do you know? Because he saw her hustling at the Malena Rojo. Malena Rojo. Reba, grandma, grandpa, here they come! [music playing] Daddy, Daddy, I've missed you so much. I've missed you too, sugar plum. Welcome home, Billy. Hi Reba. It's good to be home. Mom. You look wonderful, son. You too, Mom. It's good to have you home, boy. You're really looking good, Pa. Thank you, son. Come on inside, son. I've got your old room all ready. [music playing] Hi, Billy. Preacher Bob. How you been? Fine. How you been? Just went up to the house. They said you were out here taking a walk. What you doing down here? Out doing some thinking. Thinking? As a matter of fact, I've been thinking about the things that we talked about at the graveyard. And, uh, well, just something I don't understand. What's that, Billy? Well, how God could love me enough to, uh, well, to do all the things you said-- you know, about Jesus and all that. You know what, Billy? If I could be sure that you really loved your wife, then I think I could help you understand that. What do you mean if I love my wife? I gave up three years of my life for my wife. I mean, she's happy. She's out doing her own thing. Man, she is guilty as all get out, but I took the rap for her. I was innocent, Bob. You know that, don't you? I know that. You were innocent. She was guilty. You took the rap for her. She's off scot free, right? That's what Christ did for us. He took the rap for us. We were guilty. And now we're off scot free. He was innocent. You see the parallel between what you've done for your wife and what Christ has done for us? Yeah, I think I do, Bob. I think for the first time in my life, I understand. Thank you. Then we've accomplished something today already. Hey, about coming back to the house for a sandwich? That's a good idea. Let's go. [music playing] [SINGING]: The women in my life have been forgotten. And there's been a beauty queen or two. But when you gave your raincoat to the blind man on the street, a Jesus kind of love I found in you. [music playing] I've been a ladies' man most of all of my life, so you might wonder why I ever took a wife. 'Cause I've known a lady's charms that feel good in my arms. And I've been around with wealth a time or two. But something always seems to be a-missin'. Yeah, that kind of love begins and ends with kissin', oh, that ain't bad, it's true. But there's more to love with you, 'Cause your love starts where the kissing ends. Now the accident that left me blind is forgotten. And my bitterness toward life is over, too, 'cause when you said you'd be my eyes to guide me through this life, a Jesus kind of love I found in you. A Jesus kind of love I found in you. You're singing better, Billy. I've grown up a little. It's a beautiful evening. You want to take a walk by the creek? Yeah. [music playing] Reba, I don't know how to tell you this. But except to just try and tell you. But you're something very, very special to me. You've always been around to care for Cathy and me. I just think you're-- you're wonderful. You're my life, Billy. And you always were, right from the first. I love you, and I want to be a part of you. And I think you love me too. I know you do. [music playing] BILLY: We haven't treated you very nice, have we? Don't say that. I mean, you've had some pretty hard times. Reba, I wish I could look at you and-- and tell you things are going to be better. Hey, you know Al and I are getting the boys together, and we're going to try again. Yeah, I know you are. And I know you can do it, too. We could do it together, Billy. There's something I've got to straighten out first. You mean May? Yeah. Reba, I've got to try and help her. I know you do. [music playing] [car] Thanks, Harve, for the help. Frankly, it's against my better judgment, but I won't argue with you. I will. Look, Billy, get smart. Let sleeping dogs lie. You don't need her. He's right, you know. It might get you in a lot of trouble. For everybody's sake, why don't you forget her? Man, she's in there because she wants to be. Nobody forced her. I can't buy that, Al. And even if I could, I've got to try and help her. Are you coming? I'll wait outside. Hi, Ellie. Would you tell Miss Blue we're here? Would you come with me? [music playing] Would you wait here, please? What'll it be, pal? Nothing, thanks. Who you here to see? May. Who? May Blue. You wanted me? Hello, May. I couldn't stop him, May. What do you want, Billy? I'd like to talk to you, May. I'm busy. Besides, my time costs money. Come on, May. I said money. You know what that is, Blue boy? Money. Cash money. Now, if you ain't got any, get out. All right. How much? Julie? That'll be 20 bucks, Bub. Look, May, we've had a bad time of it, both of us. But things can be better. I mean, me and Al, we're getting the boys back together again and we're going to try. It's going to take some time, but I know I can make it again. Don't you ever think about God, May? What I'm trying to say is, May, you need somebody. Maybe I can help you. Boy. [laughter] Oh, boy. You're the biggest square in the whole world. You sure take the cake. Can't you get it through your head, Blue boy, I don't want you. I never, ever wanted you. And I don't need anybody. Why don't you shut you mouth. And think of the baby. Now, I'm sure we can work something out. I don't want to work anything out. Well then let me try and help you. You helped me one time by keeping me out of jail. There's only one way you can help me now-- one more favor. Get out of my life. Look, May-- Can't you see you married a-- Shut up! Just shut your ugly mouth and think of the baby. You think of her. You're a fool, Billy. You're a fool. Don't you see the best thing I can do is stay out of her life? Can't you see I'm no good? You hear me, no good! Now damn you, damn you, get out! Get out! Get out! I hate you! Get out! [screaming] Get out! Get out! Get out! [screaming] Get going! [screaming] [thud] [sirens] Billy, Al called me and I had to come. I think we better go home. All right. I think I'd like to spend some time alone. Go with him. Go ahead. [SINGING]: Grace, grace, God's grace, his grace will give you victory. Grace woke me up this morning. Grace started me on my way. WOMAN [SINGING]: Grace will make you love all your enemies. Above all that, it'll brighten up your day. That's why I say-- CHOIR [SINGING]: Grace, grace, God's grace, his grace is sufficient for me. Grace, grace, God's grace, his grace will give you victory. Dear Jesus, [crying] I need you to help now more than ever, ever. CHOIR [SINGING]: His grace is sufficient for me. So if you will-- CHOIR [SINGING]: Grace, grace. Please embrace May. Please. And keep-- keep her. [music playing] [crying] [music playing] CHOIR [SINGING]: Amen. Amen.
