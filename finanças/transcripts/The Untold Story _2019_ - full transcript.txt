Sorry sir, you're Edward, I'm Denis, your cable serviceman. Yeah, hi Dennis. So please, come in. Yeah, oh yeah, wow. Geez the boys ain't gonna believe this one. Holy mackerel. He's Edward Forester.

TV's right there. Yeah. Can I offer you a coffee or an expresso? Oh no, nah sir, I don't wanna impose, you know. I get up early, hit the gym, grab a cup of Joe, you know, and get off to work and stuff like that. If I have more than one cup a day, I get the shits and the shits and stuff. So hey, what is this, Mr. Forester, sir? This is what, kinda like your little secret getaway? You know I understand like kinda like your little you know do what you want kinda do man cave. What is that, cocoa? Uh, it's a little cinnamon. Cinnamon? You change your mind? No, I... Sure what the hell. Yeah, let's go, I'm on my way back to the office, any problems you just hit the bathroom there, you know? - A little cinnamon? - Sure, why not? Uh, that's enough, that's enough. Thank you, back just a little. - There you go. - Yeah. Awe, thanks, Ed. Oh cheers, here's to ya. Ed Forester. Hey, can I get your autograph? Oh yeah, sure, if I can dig up a pen somewhere. Ah geez, here we go, boom, pow. Hey. Uh, to Denis, with one N. Yeah, I see. Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's right there, D-E-N-I-S. That's good, E-D-W-A-R-D. Thank you. That's just great. - This is crazy. - Yeah. - Man, aw thanks. - Uh huh. Hey, can I have your friend on top of the Denis right there? Oh right. And then over there. Your friend, Edward Forester. - Oh. - And thank you for my TV cable service. Wow. Aw, just beautiful, beautiful. Okay, okay, hold on one sec, ready? - Cheese. - Cheese. Yeah. Good morning, Bethany, Edward. Is Adam available? Thank you, I'll hold. Edward. Hey Rebecca. Hi. Oh my God, I thought that was you. How's your show? Still waiting to hear if we're picked up next season. Gorgeous car. A little present from me to me. What's going on with you? Uh. I'll call you sometime and fill you in. You better. Did I see it? I was court side next to Nicholson, are you kidding? I know the place exploded, yeah, ball, he crushed it right over Labram's head. It was fantastic. What? Edward's been on hold for over five minutes. Okay. Listen, I gotta bounce. Tomorrow, I'm late. What line is he on? Four. Good morning, Edward. Sorry to have kept you waiting. That's quite all right. What's happening? Oh, you know, same old, same old. Still shoveling shit uphill. How goes it with you? Oh, just trying to get settled into the new place. Actually I'm glad you called, Edward. There's some changes going on at the agency. Call it a merger, if you will. But I was thinking it might be a good idea for you to meet a colleague of mine over at Triad before things start getting really ugly around here. You're dropping me. Edward, you've been far too successful and there's way too much well known water under the bridge for me to just drop you, my old friend. No, think of it as a transition to another agency that might be a better fit. A better fit? That's what you're calling it? Please don't make me feel like a piece of shite. It's been nigh-on-impossible, getting you a job since your little stunt at the Rat Channel. Oh Adam, please. Don't use that as an excuse for my not working. Well I know you went awol for a year, but Hollywood doesn't forget. Edward, Edward, just think of it as a favor from me to you. Go see my boy at Triad. Adam, you know I can't start over with a new agent, not at this phase in my career. The groundwork's already beset. Bethany will arrange a meeting. You've been a great client and a good friend. I'm just looking out for you. So I just wait to hear from Bethany. That's right. And Edward, I do truly hope it turns around for you, pal. Chow babe. Oh actors. - Candy baby. - Hi. - You got it. - I got it, what part? Well what does it matter what part? It's six weeks in Miami and you get your own driver. Whoa, what kind of car? It's a smart car. Oh. A very smart, a limo type of car. And a thousand per diem a week. Oh my god, Mr. Stone. Oh you're amazing. I try, Candy, I try. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Yes, Bethany.

Reduce my overhead? Do you have the foggiest idea where I live now? No. Well, it ain't Beverly Hills. Samuel, I'm an actor, that's what I do and I will climb my way back to the top.

Eddie, I don't think that there's anything more that we can do for you, I'm sorry. I really do wish you the best. Edward! Mr. Forester! Please, I need to speak with you. Let me park really quick. Hello, sir. My name's Jeremy Robely. God, this so incredible. Yeah, how so? Your agent, Adam Stone, I believe, I sent him a script with an offer to be in my movie. Really? When? A few weeks ago. But I never heard back, so, just assumed a. Uh, have you made your film yet? No, no, we have a start date though. Who's director? You're looking at him. No worries, Mr. Forester, I'm an SC Film School grad and I know my craft. Well that's refreshing. Jeremy, is it? Yes, sir. Well Jeremy, I'm in the middle of changing agents right now, can I get your information and have my new representatives get back to you? Definitely. Halfway to 60 Productions. I just turned 30. I have a script in the car if you'd like one. That's okay, I'll have someone get back to you and we'll go from there. I understand and no pressure, it's just we have to have a cast committed by end of next week. Fair enough. Okay. Can you pass me the script? Just happen to have a copy. The Best Medicine by Jeremy Robely. Who's Cutting Edge Entertainment? It's a independent film studio in the valley. I think once you when the script, you'll understand why I want you to play Reginald T. Blauvelt the 3rd. Okay, I'll give it a read. Excellent. It's such a pleasure meeting you, sir. It's really important to me that you're in this film. Thank you. I look forward to your thoughts on the script. Be well. I got here as soon as I could. Alrighty. Ooh, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. It was 102, but last I checked it dropped to a hundred. Oh good, good, good, good, okay. Let me get and move you. All right. There we go. Catarina, can I speak with you a moment? Please. Sure. Listen, I know that my check bounced last week and so if you could wait one more week, I promise I'll make it good. I will. Look, if it were up to me, I'd watch him for free. You know it's not up to me, all right? You're behind on last month's, this month's already past due. They wanna a Cashier's Check for the full amount by Friday or you have to make other arrangements for Matthew. I'm sorry. Okay? Okay. Adam Stone's office. Hi Bethany, it's Edward. Oh hi, Edward, are you looking for Adam? No actually, Bethany, I wanted to talk to you. Oh what's up? Any word on scheduling a meeting with that agent from Triad? I'm sorry, I didn't get his name. Aaron Michaels, he's on vacation. Let me circle the wagons and find out when he's due back. That would be much appreciated. I would really like to get something in the books. Oh and Bethany, did you get a spec-script for me called The Best Medicine from a kid named Jeremy Robely? I don't think so, but you know how many spec-scripts we get, I'll check.

Time to get back in the game. Get a water, please. Edward Forester? Harold Miller. Harold, pleasure to meet you. It's quite an honor. I grew up watching The Six. Never missed an episode. I even own it on DVD. The Six. They lived by the badge, they died by the badge. Oh my god, that brings back memories. Oh thank you. Hey can I buy you a real drink? Thank you, but we should probably wait until my wife gets here. How long you been married? 12 wonderful years, today. Congratulations. Thanks. The Six. Whatever happened to the guy who played Sergeant Richards? The grumpy one who walked with a limp. Yeah, Deacon Smith. God rest him, he passed about 10 years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. Heck of an actor. That was a real limp too. I didn't know that. What about the guy who played your partner? Um, oh Tom McBride. You don't see much of him any more. Yeah, well ah, sadly Tom is no longer with us either. Wow, I am really striking out here. Glad you're still with us. I'm guessing she's with you. Harold, it's wonderful meeting you. Take care, Mr. Forester. Happy anniversary. Thanks. Edward, it's so good to see you. Thanks for meeting me here. Yeah, I kinda like it. It was such a nice surprise to bump into you the other day and an even nicer one to get your call. How is your mom? Still running marathons if that tells you anything. Well good for her. She was excited to hear that we were getting together. What would you like? Whatever you're having will be fine. Two camps, please. I can't remember the last time I saw you. I figured you were back doing Broadway again. No, I was out of the country for a while. Ah, that lovely Italian broad with an ass like a nectarine. Is that all you remember about her? And that she was rather tall. I hate women like that. Nah, we're done. Conscious uncoupling, I think they call it now. So as not to offend the other party. So are you seeing anyone special? No. Go ahead. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Oh thanks. It'll just be a sec. Thank you. To your success. And yours. So what's next for you? Have any exciting projects on the horizon? - Well, there's this one... - I'm so sorry. Let me just respond and then I'll turn it off. Well, you're a busy girl. It's my agent. There's a film they want me for, but it totally conflicts with my schedule. I am so over that show. I really wanna make the jump to big screen. There, I'm all yours. Well, there is this film I've been approached on and I should know more next week. Well they'd be lucky to have you. So? So? Well you didn't wanna get together to discuss showbiz, did you? You know I'm not the innocent young thing that you remember when we first met. And if you don't hurry up and make your move, I'm just gonna have to get started without you. Whoa, Rebecca, I'm flattered really, but ah, oh you caught me by surprise here. Oh baby, I am so sorry. Do you have a little blue pill you could take? That is not the problem. What? My agency let me go last week and quite frankly, I need representation. You're joking, right? Unfortunately no, and when I saw you the other day, I thought... Hey, maybe Rebecca can help. Rebecca, I apologize if I gave you the wrong impression, but really this is just a friend reaching out for help. Much like I did for you to jumpstart your career. And I had to jump a lot of people, Edward to get to where I am with my success. I understand. Right now, I need someone in my corner. Someone to go to bat for me and remind Hollywood that I'm ready to go back to work. What do you want me to do? At the very least, ask your agent to take a meeting with me. That's where it gets complicated. He knows you and I have a long history together and well, you know, awkward. I am really sorry. My god, Edward, I grew up a fan and I had the privilege of getting to know you. I mean really know you and I like that man. This one, not so much. Do you know how traumatized I am right now? Where did I see my Zantacs. I gotta go. You're home early. Yes, I am. Have a good evening. Come on. I'm over here watching cartoons. How was your date? I reached out to a friend and it backfired. Was it a woman? It happened to be, yes. Want me to kick her ass? Yes. What's your name? Catarina. It's a beautiful name. I'm Edward Forester. You retired? I look old enough to be retired? No, I'm an actor. Aren't we all? This is my little hero, Matthew. Matthew, this is Mr. Forester. Hey Matthew. Catarina, I think I misjudged you. No getting all sentimental on me, Forester. I gotta enough flies to swat. Hi, this is Edward. Hi Edward, it's Bethany, how you doing today? Doing fine. I think I'm getting near the end of unpacking things I haven't used in 20 years. - What's up? - Get my attorney on the phone. I'll call you back. Is everything all right? Does everything look as though it's all right? What happened? Candy got arrested in some Miami nightclub. She told me she was 21. You heard her, right? I, oh... She's 17 years old. - Oops. - Yeah. Little bitch lied to me. Can you believe it? I'll call your attorney. All right. Hmm. Hi Bethany. Sorry about that. I heard Adam, is he okay? Yeah, nothing new under the sun. Look, I wanted to tell you I still haven't locked down your meeting with Aaron Michaels. He's still, shall we say, on the lam. Bethany, I appreciate your help. I'll standby. - Edward? - Yeah. It'll all work out. Thank you. - Hello? - Jeremy, hi, Edward Forester. Wow, hello. How are you, sir? I'm good, listen, I just wanted to tell you that I'm still in the process of changing agents, so it may be a couple of days before you hear anything. Okay, understandable. Thanks for letting me know. Just didn't want you to think once again that your project was going unattended to. I appreciate that. I'll tell everybody you called. Are the melons ripe? Oh yes, ma'am. Hello Lydia. How are you? I thought you hated asparagus. Well times and people have been known to change. Have you now? Nice seeing you, Lydia. Aw, don't be a dick, Edward. Oh. It's okay, I got her. What's, hi Edward. I haven't seen your name in the trade since you bitch slapped Walt's boy genius. When did you get back anyway? Four months ago. You never hit me. Probably still be married if you did. Well you knew your craft, he didn't. Your profession's no more faithful than I was. To lock your car. You can take a cab back in the morning, okay? I'm not suppose to drive. I fell off my horse last summer and got hooked on Oxi. It's magical. Takes away all kinds of pain. One for the road? No, thanks. Walter stays at his hideaway in Malibu. You're his wife. I'm his beard. Turned out we have similar desires. And when the sex is not right, nothing's right. Is that what happened to us? You were the best lay this side of the Atlantic.

That's my assistant, Jeff. - Hey Jeff. - Pleasure. Shall we? How was your vacation? My mother was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. Jeff did his best to bob and weave while I was out so I can care for her. She just passed. Oh I'm so sorry, Aaron, truly. My mom was a huge fan. I told her you were coming in, she said, wow, my son finally made it. That's very kind. Okay, let's talk strategy. Now I'm sure you're aware opportunities become less and less the older you get. Don't misunderstand, you look good. It's obvious that you take care of yourself, but it's gonna be about us getting you some pivotle roles, rebranding your image. So cameos is the diplomat. Senator. Father of the 40 year old virgin bride are gonna become more and more important. All right. My mother said if I'm lucky enough to get Edward Forester as a client, don't drop the ball. I promised her I wouldn't. You sign on with Triad, you'll be our priority and we will kick some serious ass together. Sleep on it. Call me whenever you make a decision. You didn't mention that tabloid incident. You smacked some rude, arrogant, smart ass little punk. You should've knocked him out. Let's go kick some serious ass. All right. I'll get the contracts together and schedule for next week. Thank you, Jeff. Aaron, could you take a look at this for me? Sure. I'll give it a read this week. I need you to read that. I will. You around today, Forester or do you have another engagement? What do you need? Well, I got another job that suddenly came up and Matthew's usually in daycare, but can you just keep an eye on him for me today? Just a couple of hours. Uh. Please, please, please. I'm mean we'll call it even for the little peep show I gave you, huh? And payback for the laundry. Sure, bring him over. Oh. He's been fed and watered and he has a brand new DVD. So you won't even know he's here. You should give me your number, just in case of emergencies. Okay, drop in your digits. What's your number? Uh, 5557641. Two, one, three, three, one, oh?

I love you my little hero, hmm. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. You're gonna stay with me, okay? Bye. Why don't you help me find my DVD player, huh? Wanna do that? Come on, it's in a box somewhere. Ain't you got anything more productive to do than to stare at keister all day? I just wanna make sure she doesn't scratch the car, that's all, Roxy. And I was thinking about fixing up and keeping the silver bullet. That car is mean. There is no way I'm letting you drive that car around town. Well you have no say. - It's... - Well I do have a say, are you kidding me? Nice job on the car, sugar. Gracias. Yeah, nice job painting, sugar. Don't call me sugar. Only my friends call me sugar. Well we could be friends. Don't be a pig. Pay the girl. 250, two, 250? Hundred bucks for the front window, right? 10 bucks a car, there's 15 cars out there. Do the math, sugar. Don't call me sugar. Pay her three. What, what did she say? What did she say? I should charge him 400. Oh minimum. Feel like I'm being hustled here, ladies. Somebody help me get out of this tower. This is Edward. Hey, how are you? Sure, can you give me an hour? Let down your hair. Great, I'll be there. Yes, of course. Catarina, it's Edward. All is well. I've got a meeting across town. Matthew's with me.

Oh wait. How 'bout a hot fudge sundae, sound good? Hot fudge sundae it is. Coming right up. Oh can we get a booster seat too, please? Jeremy, great script, I never laughed so hard in my life. Thank you. You're welcome. You know and it wasn't just the humor. It was the heart of the whole story. I mean you did such a great job establishing the character, his needs, his dynamics. You know I've done over 40 films, right? I just hope you know that, well how special this one is to me. Mr. Forester, may I speak frankly? By all means. The production company has hired somebody else to play your part. I'm sorry. What happened? The money people decided they wanted somebody else in the role. I learned that just before I called you. Here you go, sweetheart. Two extra spoons. Thank you. You're welcome. I was assured you could play the role of Reginald T. Blauvelt the 3rd or I wouldn't have offered it to you. They didn't keep their word. Imagine that. I trust the value of a handshake. That's how I was raised on our farm. Your word is your bond. I was warned something like this might happen. I really thought it'd be different. I don't know what else to say. I don't get it. It's all right. Thank you for telling me in person. Have some ice cream. There's mommy. Hi. Everybody survive the day? He's no problems. No, we had fun, huh Matthew? Get your shoes, sweetheart. - Thank you. - Oh wait a second. What is this? It's for your co-pilot. I already have one in my car. Wait, it's a gift. No, I only need one. When he drives you can sit in the other one. Thank you. Bye, Matthew. Sign and initial both pages, please. All right, I'll get these copied and be back in a flash. So look, I loved the script. What's your involvement? Well I was gonna play one of the leads, but I just found out I've been replaced. Replaced? Well I called down to Cutting Edge. They dropped it. Sorry. So onward and I've already got some interest in you, but I need some new head shots. Now I need one formal in a tux, one in casual attire, one is a judicial robe, if you can get it, and one wearing a sundress holding a great big rainbow lollipop, Edward, you're not listening to a word I'm saying. What would it take to get the rights to that project? Best Medicine? Edward, it's done, finished, kiss it goodbye. Could you give us one second? Yeah sure. This film has gotta get made. I already told you, I love the script. And I respect your passion. What's your play here? I don't know. I've never done this before, where do I start? Well traditionally if you want the rights, they cost money. How much? Hello Jeff, find out from Cutting Edge what'll take to get the rights to Best Medicine. So now you wanna be a producer. I get it. All I needed were head shots. Do you wanna direct too? No, I just want total creative control. You plan on funding the project yourself? 'Cause you'll need to if you want that kinda juice. Who do you wanna direct? The guy who wrote it. Jeremy Robely? The guy has zero directing credits. Getting a cast attached, it's gonna be tough. If she's available, what about Rebecca Leigh? You could package us, right? With cast? I appreciate the vote of confidence here, but I'm not a packaging agent. But I know you have your differences with Adam, but be smart, swallow your pride and use him. Talk to me, goose. All right, thanks. It's budgeted at 2 1/2 million. So far they got 50 grand into it. It's all yours for 75. 75. What, thousand? Yeah. Can I have a word? Barbara, why don't you got into my office? - Okay. - You look great. Thank you. Mm, I'll be right in. Samuel, how do I tap into my CD account? You go to a bank and you make a withdrawal. That's it? How much? 75 thousand, I'm buying rights to a screenplay. Eddie, I told you that money is your safety net. Why don't you just get a free option on the script like everybody else? The company that owns it wants their investment back up front. You take that money out and you are looking at severe penalties. What kind of penalty? You need to talk to your CPA. I don't have one. Look, when the film is financed... If the film is financed. Eddie, you know the movie business. It's a crap shoot, crap. Get it? One that you can't afford to take. Look I have got to go.

Wow! Did you do this? What's with all the noise over there? It's not noise, Catarina, it's music. I had a very special day. Hey why don't you guys join me for dinner, both of ya. Come on, I don't wanna celebrate by myself. You asked for the bueno. Catarina, are you coming? Yes, I am coming! Just be a little patient, please. Oh, beautiful. Very beautiful. Please, come in. What's this for? What is this for, what do you mean what is this? It's for you, what do you think it's for? You make me feel like a stupid little school girl. I'm sorry, it's been a while. You understand? Yeah, me too. May I open it? Don't be so dramatic. Open it. Circle of friends. That's very nice. It was my family's. Thank you. How long have you guys lived here? Three years. We used to live downstairs, but the people upstairs they just made so much noise, you know. Boom, boom, boom, all the time. Sounds like they really enjoyed one another. They were break dancing. Ah break dance, yeah. - Wow. - Break dancing, they were. Yes and it made it feel like an earthquake down here. So you're an actor. How come you don't work any more? I google you. Oh, of course you did. All right, what did google tell you? You like to fight. You're like a boxer. You like to knock everybody out. Oh come on, I didn't knock him out. I backhanded some little punk who was being disrespectful. And then you beat up some newspaper writer in New York. Why you gotta go around hurting people, hmm? It wasn't like that. I had a lead in a Broadway show and some critic really panned me. So you had to hit him? You really want me to relive this? Yes, I think I do. Okay, uh, he blamed my bad performance on my wife, who he announced publicly he was having an affair back in Los Angeles. First I'd heard of it. Couple of nights later, I ran into him and his cronies in a popular restaurant. I had too much to drink so I went over and called him out. He threw his drink in my face and I busted his nose. Was he right? Either way I lost. Got fired from the show and came home to an empty house in L.A. So what were you doing in Karamoja? Something for somebody besides myself. Come on, Forester, speak English. What are you trying to say? That I always put my career first. Never get away from Hollywood. Never go find myself, as the psychs say, you know reshuffle my priorities. So I booked a flight to Africa and ended up in Karamoja, Uganda volunteering for a bunch of do-gooders. And what kind of good were they doing? They make sure that children in Third World countries have a fair shot at life. I learned a lot more from them than they did from me. Mission accomplished. Fast forward, here I am ready to get back in the game. How I misjudged you. Is his father in his life? No. He's a good kid, why not? You know it's getting late. I think it's time to go. Mateo. Get your things. Mateo. It would be nice to know something about you. You going to take a swing at me now? I didn't mean to say that. Hi. Hi. You inquiring about the studio for rent? No, actually I was looking for Jeremy Robely. He moved out last week. You wouldn't happen to know where he went? Couldn't tell ya, he stayed to himself. He was month to month. I think I still have phone number on him though. The 8-0-5 number? That's the one. It's been disconnected. But thanks anyway. Well good luck. Hey if you see him, tell him he owes a cleaning fee. It's good, huh? Is it hot? Ooh hot. This is not my first barbecue. Hey, how's it going? Hey. Jail bait. Well, well, well. What a nice surprise. Edward, how are ya? Adam. How they hanging my brother? So everything okay? How are things working out? So far, so good. Why don't you tell him about it? Tell me about what? I'm acquiring rights to a screenplay. Lucky you. You know maybe you heard of it. The Best Medicine. Doesn't ring a bell. Huh. Well once I get all the pieces together, would you be interested in packaging it? Edward, I am touched that you would ask. So tell me, is it a comedy, action, thriller? Talk to me. Well it starts out as a comedy, but it kinda shifts gears in there. Hi baby. Ella, you're interrupting a very important conversation here. Go grab a couple of seats. I'll be right over. Oh and a diet soda. No ice. So it's a dramedy. Yeah, I guess it could be classified as such. What's the budget? I haven't gotten that far. I just secured the rights. Get me the script. I'll run up the flagpole, see if anybody gets a hard on. We'll go from there. Adam, there's already a director attached. Great, who? A Jeremy Robely. That's a good choice. I love his work. All right, gentlemen, well I look forward to reading the script. But now I have to give my undivided attention to young Ella. Yeah. I know, I know. Yeah. Mr. Forester. Hi. Hi. I don't follow, you're gonna have to spell it out for me. Look, we wanna avoid whatever internal drama's going on over there and just acquire the project. No more, no less. Is that it? All right. We have a problem. How so? Cutting Edge rejected your check. Why is was a Cashier's Check? That ain't the problem. Someone doesn't want you owning that property. Any idea who? - No. - Any luck with the director? Can't find him. That's great, okay. So let's recap. You have no rights to the script, your director's MIA, and your leading lady's in the funny farm. Sounds like a typical Hollywood production to me. You set a start date yet? Get me those head shots I asked for and let's move on from this god forsaken mess. Excuse me for a minute. Excuse me, miss. Hi. I didn't think you recognized me. Yeah. I'm Natasha. Yes, Jeremy's friend. Nice to meet you, I'm Edward Forester. Do you have a new number on him? Wish I did. He's gone back home to Ventura. When he quit, he just upped and left. He quit? You didn't hear what happened? No. Your life inspired his script. When they wouldn't honor the agreement to have you in, he walked. Jeremy wouldn't do it without you. And I didn't realize. Do you know anybody that might have his contact information? We were just getting to know each other. Never met anyone so passionate about their work. Oh no, thank you, Natasha, you've been a great help. If you do hear from him, would you please have him give me a call? Sure. Will you do me a favor? If you find him, tell Jeremy I said hi. I certainly will. And I'll make sure he calls you too. Mr. Forester. He loves fishing. Thank you. Oh well, of course. I mean they're only wanting everything that's currently going and obviously dates are gonna be pushed back. So that means that they're gonna be possibly the same. Hello. What's your husband's involvement with Cutting Edge Entertainment? Edward? Yes. He's acquiring it, why? I'm trying to buy a script they own. We had a deal and somebody blocked it. Look, I'll get back to you, okay? She was using false documents. We can prove it. I was the one who booked Candy in on the movie, remember? Frederick, damn it, of course they wouldn't have hired her if they knew she was a minor. Especially on that movie. Listen, I cannot take another scandal like this. What? Best Medicine. - Huh? - Aaron at Triad said you wanted to see it for Edward. Over there. Frederick, Frederick, this is not my first barbecue. I know I'm in the shit here, damn it. I'm counting on you, Freddy. Okay? Now it's your job to make sure and keep the wolves away. Good and then yours truly here will come up with a creative solution to make this all disappear. Oh, fucking kids today. Adam Stone's office. Did you read this? No, but lit just sent up coverage on it. Haven't read anything this good since The Last Goodbye. Get Edward in here. Lickity split. Walter. I need to talk to you. I know you're in there. Excuse me. Lydia. You know you're suppose to call first. I hate this stupid castle. Walter. We need to talk. God. This is ridiculous. Where are you? Darling, what a pleasant surprise. But why the hostility, are we off our meds again? Take a hike, Kenneth. Go. Something I can do for you, Lydia? Why did you block Edward's attempt to acquire the rights to that script? Mm, I beg your pardon. Don't fuck with me, Walter. I'm not in the mood. You know damn good well what I'm talking about. Oh, oh that. Well my investment group seems to of had a change of heart and believes that it could be a valuable asset. But it's not like it's part of any film library you're adding to your precious little empire. It's only a script. Well perhaps. However I do believe Kenneth would do a marvelous job directing it. Oh. I get it. You're only doing this because Edward kicked your little Ken doll's ass a year ago. How petty and vindictive can you be? Ooh, careful sweetness. Have you forgotten I own this town? I can see to it your precious Edward never works in it again. You already have. I trust you can see yourself out. Oh sweetheart. Have you forgotten? I know exactly what you're up to professionally and personally and it would be such a hoot to spill the beans on the great and powerful Walter Buchanan. And what's really behind the curtain, hmm? Your move, darling. The letter saying the US was very sorry for the plane's unauthorized landing. A plane left Guam received the US proof as Chinese officials negotiated the final details of the release. Good afternoon, Aaron. Hey, I gotta make this quick, but I wanted to be the first one to call you. What's going on? Well I got an email from Cutting Edge Entertainment. The Best Medicine by Jeremy Robely is all yours. Congratulations. Aaron, that's wonderful, thank you. Well half the battle is won, now go find your director. Yeah, I really think we're putting the cart before the horse. Especially without my director here. You can never start this process too soon. They're all quite good. Let's take a look at the role of Maxine then, shall we? Hey, you flipped through that one a little fast there, chief. For who, the granddaughter? Edward, please. She's a rising star and the agency's first choice. She's a lovely girl, but she's just, she's not right for the part. What about her? You really want to force an audience to stare at her for 93 minutes? Starred on Broadway in Annie. She studied at the Strasbourg Institute. Summer Stock at Westport, great theater. Impressive credits, Adam, what's wrong with that? She's a total diva. She's let success go to her head. Can you arrange a meeting. Ah look, you're gonna be much happier with her, trust me on this. You gotta a reel on her I can see? The agency is really excited about her. You are staring at the next big thing. I'm telling you. Look, it's getting late, Edward and I'm doing you a really big favor here. I've already given her the script and she loves it and she's memorized the part already and she wants to play it. You're sleeping with her. Oh god, you're sleeping with her. I'm a happily married man, okay? So just back off. She's perfect. She got a lot of sparkle in her eyes. She's tall. You're tall. She's teachable, I mean what the hell else do you need? Your girlfriend there has no film credits and no stage experience. She's got a video on YouTube, over a hundred thousand hits. You know what? This project doesn't belong here. I'm trying to help you, man. Edward, my friend, what are you doing? Please, god, man, have a seat, we can talk this thing through. If you go out that door, you're making a huge mistake. I'll take my chances, excuse me. Where's your passion? Where's the fight? Or did that die with the rest of your career? You need me on this project. When you went off and did your holier than thou shit, nobody cared and now that you're back, they care less. Excuse me. And one email blast and this little project is a big taboo. Nobody in Hollywood is gonna look at it. Not unless they're desperate or washed up just like you. Well that's it. That's what I've been waiting for, the real Edward Forester finally shows up. Go on, old man, give me your best shot. Go on, knock me the fuck out. Edward, please I just wanted to see if you really believed in this like I do. I mean, please Edward, I just, I need this one. Just this once. Sorry, Adam. Fuck. Yes Edward. I got the rights back to the Best Medicine. Whatever you did, thank you. You're welcome. Did you read it? Yes. And? I couldn't put it down, I was touched so. Your writer captures everything that's honorable, fine, and true. For God's sake, please. Don't let Hollywood screw this up. So you like it. I loved it. It's you, Edward. It's you from start to finish. Is there anything I can do for you? Lydia? I gotta go. Hey, Forester. The other night was a very special celebration for you and I ruin it. No, you didn't, I just... Why do you always try to correct me when I talk? Why don't you just be nice and agree with me, you know? Okay, I agree to agree. I have to get to work. I'm late. Of course you are. Why don't you ask me out? You know, like an engagement. You mean a date? That would be nice. How 'bout dinner tonight? For three? Yes, what time is good for you? Where are taking us? Someplace very special. Okay, six o'clock, don't be late. I'm going to paint very fast. Oh hey, I gotta take a road trip up to Ventura, could really us a co-pilot, one that likes ice cream. Okay, I will get your co-pilot. And I dress very nice for you tonight.

Good afternoon. Betcha she can handle just about anything at sea. Yeah, she'll hold her own, she's a good old ship. Hi. This is Ahab. Like to give him a treat, huh? Let me see if I got a treat here in my pocket. Ahab take a treat from that young man. He might nibble your finger but it won't hurt ya. You know I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for a fella by the name of Jeremy Robely. I understand he loves to fish. You know him? Is he a deckhand? You know I'd be guessing. You know, Owen over there on the Hammerhead, he knows about everybody over here. He might be able to help you out. You can recognize him, he's got tattoos all over him, tough looking dude. Got a parrot on his shoulder and bunch of bird crap all over his shirt. All right. - Thank a lot. - You bet. See ya. ♪ Our time is what we make of it ♪ ♪ Open minds embracing it ♪ ♪ Overflowing feelings for you ♪ ♪ So let's take a ride ♪ ♪ Turn your face to me ♪ Tell him, Duke boy, kill him, kick him. Excuse me. Could you hold up a minute? Yeah. You Owen from Hammerhead? Aw man, why do you guys always pressing me? I haven't done nothing. No, no, no, I just I need your help. A Captain over there said you might know where I could find a friend of mine. Jeremy Robely? Man, I thought you were trying to pin the kid there on me. Oh, no. Sorry to alarm you. I understand Jeremy loves to fish. Yeah, a clean cut looking kid. Yeah, he's a good kid. Can't fish for shit though. That's Chester. Chester always brings the ice cold beer but never gives you nothing when you clean his damn fish. Well it's 'cause Chester's afraid of you. It's because of all that tattoo stuff on your arms. Man, if I was him, I wouldn't tip you nothing neither. You're a scary looking dude. I'm an approachable person. I know Jeremy. He's a little shrimp, right? Okay. Yeah. Now that little dude, he can fish. And these aren't gang tattoos either, knucklehead. I told you they're military. French Foreign Legion. Never saw you speak a word of French. You got a card of something? Next time I run into Jeremy, I'll pass it along and tell him you're looking for him. Yeah, I'd appreciate that. Where did he go, he was just here? Matthew! Matthew. Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! Have you seen the little boy who was with me? The big curly hair, brown shirt? No, sorry. - Matthew! - Hey. Sorry, I, I'm sorry. Sir! I'm looking for a little boy who's lost. He's got dark complexion, big curly hair, he was wearing a brown shirt and blue jeans. How old is he? He looks like he's four, maybe five. When did you see him last? Just a minute ago over at the dock entrance. This is Dias, has anyone got a 20 on a lost boy. Four years old, brown shirt, blue jeans, last seen over at Sea Bassey. He's carrying a stuffed monkey. You mean like the one that's in your hands? Yes, and this one. What's the child's name? Matthew, but he can't talk. Okay, sir, calm down, I'm trying to help. Does Matthew know how to swim? - What? - Does he know how to swim? I don't know. So Jolynda, we got ourselves a deal? What do you think? Yeah, it's a nice car. All right, gotta deal. All right. Yeah, get the paperwork started then. Sounds good. All right. Can you run this for me, babe? Sure. You're selling the silver bullet? Yeah, I get a little too much attention in that thing. So I get a chick magnet. You guys having fun or what? What? Roxy, Matthew's missing. They can't find him anywhere! Missing from daycare? No, no, no, from Ventura Harbor. Please you have to... Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, Danny, we gotta go! What? Roxy! Hey, can you finish the windows before you high-tail it outta here? No, we don't have time, her boy's missing! Hold on. Take the silver bullet. It's faster. Come on, Catarina! Excuse me. Sorry guys, it's an emergency. Sorry. Call me when you find him. We will. He couldn't be that... Did you find him? Are you the boy's mother? Did you find him, please tell me? Did you find Matthew? Catarina, they're doing everything they can. No, no, no, no, no, no. You lost him? How could you be so careless? I am so sorry. - He just... - No, no, no, no. - He was just... - I trusted you and then you just let - Ma'am. - Go of him. - Come over here. - Who are you? - Ma'am, ma'am. - What good are you, huh? - Ma'am! - Ma'am. - Oh yes, yes. Our units are surrounding the area, okay? The boy shouldn't be too far. Mr. Forester answered some questions. - He knows nothing. - We'll find him. - He knows nothing. - We'll find him. Ma'am, you're gonna have to calm down. Calm down. Do you have a picture of Matthew? Yes, I do, in my phone. In my phone in the car, Roxy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Are you the child's mother? No, no. His grandmother. Where's the boy's mother? She's dead. Deceased? Yes, that is what I said. She's dead. What about the father? He's not involved. Okay. There he is. That's Matthew? Oh, he's a beautiful boy. Mm-hmm. Take a look. What's his date of birth? June 15th and he's going to be six. Six. Can he swim? - Huh? - Can he swim? No, okay, it's fine. It's okay. - Oh my god, he can't swim. - No, no, no, that's okay. - No, it's not okay. - It's okay, we'll find him. It's okay, he's gonna be found. Calm down. I wish you were dead! Catarina. - Dead! - Ahoy there. - Mateo. - Oh, you see him. Mateo! Mateo! Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Come here, come here, come here. Baby. Oh baby! I was coming back from lunch and sitting on the edge of the boat playing with Ahab was this good-looking little boy. He's all right. Thank you so much, thank you, thank you. All good, and you're welcome. Hey honey. Hi, is this your grandma? Sweetheart, I need you tell me, is this your grandmother? Ah officer, the boy is unable to speak. Oh there's plenty of pictures of the two of them in here. - I think we're okay. - Yeah. I'm gonna go call it in. Yep. Ma'am? Do you wanna press any charges against Mr. Forester? No. No? All right. Looks like our work here's done. You got it? Thank you. You're welcome. Oh you. Thanks, Captain. My pleasure. There's no room in Roxy's car and you have the only car seat. I'm sorry for the ugly things I said to you. I didn't mean them. I've never been so scared in my life. Can you forgive me? Please. Yes, of course. I forgive you. It sounds so simple. I never forgave my daughter, Rosy. Not caring for my grandson. Leaving him in his filth for days. All for damn drugs. We don't even know who the father is. What happened to Rosy? It was three years ago, Christmas. She just gave Mateo this little monkey he will never put down. It's the only nice thing she ever did for him. There was a knock at the door and she went to answer it. It was drug dealers. He shot her in the head. She was holding Matthew in her arms when I happened. He hasn't spoken a word since. I am so sorry. All the time I take my pain out on everyone. Just pissed at the world. Bad habit. Hell I can certainly understand why. Look what it's gotten me, hmm. Nada. Nada. Seat belt. Please. Hey, you hungry? How 'bout something healthy for a change? What are we doing? Stopping for some fresh fruit. I fell asleep. Did I snore? Not too much. Why didn't you wake me up? Hey cutie pie. I don't have any money. I was working and then you called. I didn't get paid, so. Give me your hand. I'll buy, you pick it out. Okay, but I'm going to pay you back. What do you want? Whatever you guys are having. Here, okay. Here you go. Jeremy. Hey Jeremy! This is a pleasant surprise, sir. Well it certainly is. You're not an easy man to find. What are you doing out here? I live here. This is my parent's farm. What are you doing here? It's a long story. Do you mind if I call them? They would be really honored to meet you. Oh no, sure please. Excellent. This film doesn't require a ton of money. And the whole thing could take place right here and in my parent's farmhouse down the road. And we'll get a cast that's passionate about the piece. God knows actors rarely get a chance to do a script they love. What could you do this film for, I mean bare bones? My college buddies will work for the credit. We're always helping each other out. Extras are easy. Put a word out with my pastor. He can announce it at church. I guess with lights, camera, and action about 300 grand. All in. But I don't have access to that kind of money, sir. I have a source. Someone that believes in you and your script. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Would I know them? Me. I sold my Beverly Hills home with just enough of a nest egg to finance your film. Sir, I don't know what to say. We are roasting out here. Hey guys, meet Jeremy, writer and director of my next film. You already know Matthew. Your co-pilot, I remember. And this Latin beauty. Catarina Maria Alana Moralis. Pleasure ma'am. I am his date. Yes, you are. Ah, Jeremy's parents have invited us over for a real home cooked meal. Wait a minute, I can't go like this. Why didn't you tell this? I need a shower, I need to wash my hair. Okay, nevermind. It's okay. If it's okay for you, it's okay for me. Great, you guys can follow me in your car. Lead the way. Catarina Maria Alana Moralis. - You like my name? - Yes I do. What is your real name? I promise not to laugh. It's Bud Brokiski. What? Junior. What's worse than that? Matthew, where's your stuffed animal? It's in the car. Did he speak? Mateo, did you speak? You spoke? Oh my god, you say it again. It's in the car. Oh my. You guys ready? Matthew.
