This is melissa lowe reporting to you live. Los Angeles is now in its fifth day of the so-called riptide virus pandemic named for the young surfer, ain smith, who contracted the disease in australia and subsequently infected other passengers aboard air atlanta icelandic flight 182. The exposed travelers were immediately taken to the cdc's emergency response center, where they remain quarantined. Also on that flight was convicted drug kingpin edward vicente, who, in a daring escape, fled the quarantine with the aid of armed gunmen. During the breakout, an fbi agent and a security guard were brutally murdered. At this hour, the greatest fear of the cdc officials is now being realized with the exponential growth in the transmission of the virus. More than 154 have died in the metropolitan los angeles area from the virus. Cdc and fema teams are scouring the city in search of victims in door-to-door operations. Over 1,400 patients have reported to doctors or medical facilities with symptoms and are considered contagious. A just released official projection based on computer models is staggering, placing the possible death toll in the tens of thousands if the disease continues its relentless and unchecked expansion through our population. From downtown los angeles, this is melissa lowe, channel 8 news. It's time we talked. You've made a mistake taking me. I've got very important work to do. What is the name of the flu drug you've been giving everybody? The question is not that simple. Shh! I talk, you answer. You don't answer, you die. Tama-flu, but... Uh! You see how simple that was? Now, don't talk anymore. [beep beep] Get in! What do you want? I... I don't have any money. Do you have tama-flu? Do you have tama-flu? Yes. Show me! Carlos, watch the door! Ok. Ok, man. Look. Just don't shoot, all right? Shut up! Where is it? It's right here. Hurry up! How much do you want? All of it. In the bag. Is that it? It's all I got. Let's go. Unh! Do you have a history of contact with poultry or... No. I had the mumps. I had the mumps. [coughing] Hey. I'm sorry. For what, sweetie? I'm gonna miss the trials. Oh, honey. You'll make it next year, I promise. This is rick. Hi. He's gonna take really good care of you. He's smart, and he's really cute. You're not gonna stay? I got to leave, but I promise I'll be back. I'm glad you noticed he's cute. It's a step in the right direction. You get some rest, ok? I love you. I love you, too. You let me know if there's any changes, ok? Don't worry. I'll take good care of her. Dispatch, 10-14 at this time. Over. You got an eta? Yeah. They say it's gonna be about 15 minutes. Ok. Check it again. Anything? Nothing. Now what? Now we keep looking. Where? We burnt the last two days hitting every place vicente's been known to use as a safe house. Besides, his face is all over the tube. He's gonna lay low until things cool off a little. I wish I had your confidence, whitlock. So do i. Put the rest of the water in the trunk! Don't let anybody board the boat! We could use the condensation kit! Hey! What took you so long? I had to go to three stores to get everything. Mwah, mwah, mwah. Here, let me take one of these. Ok. Watch your step. God, how do I get on here? Are you back on the carbs? Michael! Ohh! I'm just kidding. Come on. It's only a joke. Hey, look what I got. We'll get her, we gotta get out of here! Tana-flu? Mm-hmm. That realtor dude passed out at my screening. I got a doctor to set us up with a couple. Oh. Here, take two. Start with two right now. Ok. Ok? It says here, "proven effective in dealing with influenza when taken at first onset of symptoms." So whatever happens in I.a., we will be hearing about... from cabo. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo. [laughs] [engine starts] Hello. It's me. I need you to do something. Can't believe you're calling me. Relax, counselor, I need your help. Well, as your lawyer, all I can do is recommend that you turn yourself in. Oh, well, I appreciate your advice. Where are you going with this, edward? I need a place to stay for a few days, where me and my associates won't be disturbed. I'm sorry. I truly am. But that would be aiding and abetting, and, as an officer of the court... An officer of the court? Listen, I understand the situation you're in, my friend, but I want you to remember that I made your career and I can end your career. I want you to remember the dump you were in before you met me and my friends. I wouldn't want you to think that I don't appreciate what you've done for me. Jeez, where are my manners? How is joyce? And that-that little boy of yours, what's his name? Paul. I surely hope they're well. Yes. And I bet you'd do anything to keep them that way. I'll find you a place. Excellent, excellent. I was thinking, you know, something by the beach might be nice. 'Cause I just... I just hate the valley. [click] Ok, tell that police chief that unless the overtime is approved by my office, it comes out of his budget. He'll take it to the council. Let him. Oh, mr. Mayor. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The mayor's busy right now. Oh, no, please. It's me, roberto ruiz. We met at my daughter's school the other day. She was the one who was reading. Of course. It's ok. That's a habit we have to break, mr. Ruiz. I'm sorry. What can do for you? Well, with this flu thing right now, I was just wondering if it indeed safe for everyone to stay in the city. As long as you're careful and wear a mask, absolutely. Roberto is it? Yes, sir. We're all in this together. And it's together we're gonna beat this thing. If you'll excuse us. Thank you very much. Making partner is all about billable hours, tom. Sorry, mr. Shepard. I told him you were busy. He says he's with the fbi. It's ok, helen. Agent whitlock and I have met before. We'll have to finish this later, tommy. Thank you. Helen, thank you. So, can I get you a drink? Scotch, if you got any. Aren't you on duty? I'm just kidding, shepard. I don't want your booze. So what do you want? Where's vicente? I have no idea. You're his lawyer. Agent whitlock, even you must be familiar with attorney-client privilege. I would say that your client gave up his privileges when he broke out of that quarantine and killed one of my agents. Ok. I think we're done here. No. I don't think so. I'm gonna make two phone calls. The first is to security, and the second is to a very good friend of mine in the attorney general's office. Don't threaten me, shepard. The doctor that your client kidnapped is the big dog at the cdc. He could be the key to this whole pandemic. Your point? My point is that unless we get on top of this soon, nobody is safe, not you, not your family. You think of anything, you give me a call. Sir, I just need you to sign right there. Well, it's all in the paperwork. I already gave them my blood. Just gotta maintain control of this. Right, and just hang on to that. Hey. Aria? Hey. What are you doing back here? I needed to come back. Are you feeling ok? You know what? For the first time, it feels like my work really matters. Before I got out of the quarantine, I photographed everybody. Nobody should ever forget this. I think that's wonderful. Thank you. I, uh... i've got an appointment, but I'll... i'll see you later. Ok. Pull it up right now! Pow. Really? We got to run everything through county? Excuse me. Got to be that way. Hey, kayla. Hey. I'm really sorry about all of this, but thank you so much. Sure. I just never dreamed we'd use this place for this. Me neither. What time do you want to go? Well, I think I'm gonna need about an hour. Oh, wow. All right. Yes, doctor. We can get you copies on that. I need a broad sample of serum. Thank you. Right away. Ok. Keep moving, keep moving. It's not a pretty sight. They did the same thing in 1918. How many people do we have processing today? Today? Uh, 12, including myself. I'll be in and out or later if needed. Uh, you'll have to excuse me. I need to get suited up. I need the mayor to see this. Where is he? You can't just summon him like one of your interns. What you have to say to him you can say to me. We have to quarantine los angeles and surrounding areas. They'll be able to move about, go to work, or stay at home. You want to close los angeles? Mr. friedlander, the riptide virus will indeed spread through california in about a week and then the united states in about a month. You want to us to keep it bottled up here? I just need 5 minutes with him. Ok, you two. Start the brake! All right. I'll be in touch. If I don't hear from you by the end of the day, I'll exercise other options. Wish there was something more I could do. Thanks. Hey, big guy. You remember when we first partnered together? I was a pain in the ass, wasn't I? I know you're not gonna quit. You're a fighter, pete. I don't want you to worry about anything. Everything's gonna be ok. Cdc's requesting all known permutations. I've got them right here. If you can fill this part out, then I'll make sure... [indistinct chatter] No, this was this part. Oh, really? Wow. This is more than I actually expected. [ringing] Kelly. Troy. Sampson died. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. I didn't know who else to call. No. No. It's ok. I better go. Wait. Troy... I wanted to say thank you for talking to gil the other night. When it comes to him, you were always right, kel. Take care of yourself. Yeah. You, too. What? I love the smell of a good scotch, sea air. Oh, sorry. Would you like one? As of noon today, we have confirmed 286 deaths attributed to this virus and 3,492 individuals who were showing symptoms. Is there a vaccine? We're working on it. Do the police have any leads as to who was behind the armed attacks and the murders here at the hospital? That is a criminal matter. You might want to direct those questions to the proper authorities. What should people do, lock themselves inside their homes? I think people should definitely be aware of public places, yes. You see, we're doing what they just ask, staying out of public places. Preliminary analysis shows that out of the two antiviral testing tama-flu has shown that it's not effective in stopping or slowing down the virus. Does the other one work? Thankfully, it looks that way, yes. Cotoxil seems to lessen the severity of the symptoms when taken on onset. So doctors should prescribe cotoxil. Yes, but it's not available to the general public as of yet. So... so how are people gonna get it then? Well, it will be available here at this hospital and other satellite hospitals. How long? Where's it coming from? We can't comment on that, but I can assure you it is on its way. You told us to take tama-flu, right? I told you it wasn't that simple. The testing needed more time. It's a brand-new flu. Where's this medicine coming from? I don't know. You don't? You're supposed to be the man in charge, right? Right? [coughs] Um... [coughs] sorry. Hmm. Unh! Ugh! [groans] Well, looks like you're gonna need the same medicine as we all do. [groans] looks like one man's flu is another man's good fortune. Welcome back to your home for news and views and flu updates every 10 minutes. In a stunning announcement just a short while ago, the cdc has informed the public that the antiviral drug tana-flu is of no use in the fight against the riptide virus. Let me repeat: The cdc has announced that... [coughing] Oh, god. Michael. [coughing] michael! What? Michael, we have tana-flu. Yeah, could you give me one? I think I need another one. No, listen. I just heard it doesn't work. It's the wrong drug. [coughing] of course it works. My doctor set me up with it. He was wrong! You're sick. You're getting sick. [coughing] Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, my god! Please, michael. Oh, please. We have to turn the boat around. Oh, my god, michael. Please help me! Please! [sobbing] [coughing] michael... [raspy cough] [sobbing] This is melissa lowe for channel 8 news. It is another grim day in los angeles as the dead continue to grow in number, filling morgues beyond capacity, and still, there is no end in sight. The once warm and friendly city of los angeles is now full of people wearing masks and fearful of the slightest human contact. With law enforcement officers working 18-hour shifts, and national guard troops patrolling the streets, I.a. has truly become a city under siege. The only places doing business are hospital emergency rooms, which are now being taxed to the point of collapse as health workers and first responders are beginning to fall prey to this insidious and deadly enemy. [cell phone ringing] Dr. kayla martin. Yes, governor. Yeah. Thank you so much for calling me back. I think it's really important that we talk. I got it. Ok. Governor. Good to see you all. Mayor dellasandro. Governor schaefer. What's this all about? Well, if we're going to quarantine los angeles, we need united leadership. I don't know what kind of game you're playing... I can assure you this is no game. Man, look at this. I ain't seen one of these in years. What the hell? What's with these masks? Eh, it's just a precaution, buddy. Who knows what this thing really is? The news says it's the flu. It's no flu. I mean, look at me. I'm not sick. There's something going on they don't want us to know about. Listen. I want you to put together a group of men we can trust for an operation I've planned. Yeah, sure. I can do that. We're gonna need every hospital bed in los angeles and then some. We're canceling elective surgeries and sending every patient home that we can to open up space. Death and disease. Not on my watch, mr. Mayor. I couldn't agree more, but that doesn't mean quarantine solves the problem. No, but it gives us time to solve the problem. A pandemic is... is like a forest fire. We need to get a ring around it to slow it down, and that's what cotoxil does. By cutting off the I.a. hot zone, it buys us time. You can't defend turning I.a. into a hot zone. Michael... Don't tell me there's no politics involved here. You want me to take responsibility? Fine. Ok. Listen. You know, if you need somebody to take the heat if this goes bad, I will, all right? Federal regulations gives the cdc... that would be me... broad powers to contain a virus that is in danger of spreading across state lines. I am ordering you to quarantine los angeles. Lady, who the hell do you think... Ken. Do it. Thank you. [doorbell rings] Hey, buddy. How you doing? I'm sorry about sampson, dad. He was a good guy. Yeah, he was. Thanks. Mom, dad's here. How are you? You? Good. I'm just a little bit stressed out with everything that's been happening. Listen. If there's anything that you, um, that you need... I'll let you know. So did I screw up the schedule? Do you have him this weekend? No, no, no. I just... I just wanted to make sure you guys were ok. We're good. I brought you this kit. You wear these if you go out. No way! Yes way! This is life for a while. Let me show you how to put it on. Hold that there. You put this here, and then you can tighten it with these straps. Look at me. Look at me. Just do it, ok? Ok. Could you give us a moment? Yeah, sure. What's up? Are you serious? Listen. I can't take that. Kelly, people get crazy at times like these. You put it in the closet, you lock it away. At least you know it's there if you need it. Ok. Can you, uh, send gil out so I can say good-bye? Sure. Thanks. Thank you. Gil, your father wants to see you. Listen. You got to take real good care of yourself and your mom for a while. So business as usual, right? No. This is different. There's a lot going on out there right now, a lot of people that are depending on me. I need to depend on you. You understand? Say good-bye. Por favor. Please. [tires squealing] My wife. Is everything... whoa, whoa! Nice and slow. Nice and slow. Take it easy. All we're carrying is medicine. Exactly. Thank you for your help with the guard. You're welcome. I hope we can put our political differences aside and work together on this. Governor, what I'm about to say to you is between us, and if you quote me, I'll deny it and come after you with everything I have. Say it. I can have an unmarked car at your house in 15 minutes. I can have you and your daughter out of the county in 30. Well, thank you, michael. That's, um... that's enormously kind, but... this is where I belong. What's up, ken? There's a problem with the trucks carrying the cotoxil. Did they have an accident? No. It's worse. Your office just received a call from mark shepard, a lawyer representing edward vicente. He's the, um... Oh, we know who he is. He wanted to know if his client could locate the shipment of missing cotoxil would the governor negotiate on his behalf for a full pardon. Give me a break. Now he made it clear that mr. Vicente didn't steal anything, but due to his connections with certain people, he might be able to help us find it. He's blackmailing me. Yes, ma'am. That's exactly what he's doing. [speaking spanish] We got called up. Muster's in simi valley. Are you guys talking about what's making people sick? Daddy's gotta go help people for a few days. Can you shoot a germ bug? If I can, baby, you know I will. I love you. Love you. [camera shutter clicking] Thanks. [coughing] We're gonna run more tests, and it's gonna determine a couple of things about what course of treatment, all right? You're doing great. Hang in there. You're doing great. Hi. Hi yourself. Can I take your picture? Sure. [coughs] I hear you're an ice skater. Yeah. [coughs] How you feeling? I know it sounds weird, but I don't feel that bad. Are you scared? I am. It's ok to be scared. I'm scared, too. [indistinct radio chatter] We're coming aboard! Makes those lines fast, fore and aft! In here, chief. Two of 'em. Go ahead and call it in, chief. Aye-aye, sir. We'll look for some i.d. on them. Looks like riptide. [sighs] Jeez! I told you to make an appointment. Where is he? I have no idea. I know about the deal you offered the governor. Where is he? What do you want? I'm tired of you, shepard, and I'm through playing games. You are insane. My partner is dead. Another of my agents is dead. I have a son and an ex-wife, who live in the city, whom I care deeply about, and I want you to look at me. I want you to believe what I'm about to tell you. I will shoot you and kill you without remorse right here, right now if you do not tell me where the cotoxil is. I don't know. You have to believe me, please. But you do know where he is. I want you all to know how proud I am to see you here today, ready to fight for your freedom. They're trying to tell us this is a flu. There's no way in hell. No. The government has seen fit to release this deadly disease. They're trying to thin out the herd a little bit, make us all fall in line, do their little monkey dance. That is no reason that we have to go quietly. Damn straight! All right. Are there any questions before we get started? Yeah. Just one. How you feeling? Like a survivor. Ha ha ha! Amen to that! I survived the unconstitutional detention of flight 182, and now together, we are going to survive the unconstitutional imprisonment of los angeles. That answer your question? Don't tread on me, brother. All right. Let's take a drive, boys. Yeah! [tires squealing] Air elements are en route. Sectors of 5. Get the breach man up front. Let's go! Team one, on me! Hrt, move up! [groaning] He's here. Clear. You ok, doc? I'm fine. We've got the doctor. You've been missed. They forced me to tell them about the cotoxil. We know. Don't worry. This is the first time an entire american city has been placed under quarantine. How we handle ourselves in the next few days will determine whether history is gonna judge us as an example of infectious disease control or just another disaster. Dr. ratner, you'll have operational authority here at emergency response center. Dr. foxhoven, you will support and assist dr. Ratner. Dr. ito, whatever your team needs, please let us know. What are we gonna do without the cotoxil? Well, does anybody have suggestions? Yeah. I think we got to get our hands on the east coast supply, get it shipped out here asap. Well, we know the virus. We understand how it enters our body and how it kills. It should take... Dr. sorkosky. Stop, everybody. Sit down. Uh, welcome back, sir. Wait. All of you need to know that there is a possibility I've been infected. Well, sir, we should get your blood work done at the lab right away. It's already been started. I presume this quarantine was your idea. Yes, it was, sir. Good call. Thank you. We need to find this man who kidnapped me, this vicente. He was in the primary exposure range of the smith boy on the plane, and he was taking the tama-flu, which we now know is the wrong antiviral, but he's not showing any symptoms. Oh. Some kind of natural immunity? No telling. Somehow, we need to get a full blood panel on this guy. It's the only way to find out. We're getting reports of widespread looting throughout the city. Wilshire boulevard between western and fairfax is now closed due to looting, as is ventura boulevard between laurel canyon and fulton. Well, I'm trying to understand the president's position, but... right. [sighs] So the president says he'll see if he can get us 15% of the cotoxil stored in tennessee. That's just great. No federal help, and the health care delivery system of I.a. is now in the hands of a convicted drug dealer? I'm gonna have to tell the people of the city the truth about the stolen medicine. What do you think will happen if you tell them that there's no medicine on the way? I mean, chief barton already said that he cannot handle both the quarantine and riots. Well, the governor offered help. Let's take it. They're gonna need clarification on our enforcement policy. What? Are we prepared to shoot people for breaking the quarantine? Jesus. All these people want to do, ken, is stay alive. What's happening to us? This is jack hendler. He was the passenger who ditched the quarantine. He seems to be stabilizing now. He actually might make it. Yeah, the ones you want to strangle usually do. What about our satellite infection in pasadena? Didn't make it. This is our nun. She lived at the homeless shelter where the cabbie lived. She came in this morning. We need that cotoxil. Sir, it's just a stopgap. What we need is a vaccine. It doesn't matter. No. It doesn't. Listen. You just keep talking to the governor, ok? Tell her she's got 48 hours to make a deal. You get me that pardon, I'll make sure you get some for you and your family, ok? How do you trust this shepard when he ratted you out to the fbi, huh? I don't, but I need him. You know, I've been thinking. What do we got, a million doses? Let's say we put 50,000 on the street at 200 a pill. Well, that's $10 million. Exactly. What if the governor finds out? I want her to find out. [tires squeal] Hey. Got the cash? Yeah. Here you go. [ringing] Yeah. This better be important. I hear you got the stuff. Sure. Show me the green. Is this good? Sure. Thank you. Just busted a dealer in beverly hills. And? Well, he wasn't selling heroin or cocaine. I need a full ride. Mm-hmm. Impressive. Here you go. What was he selling? Cotoxil. The number of deaths caused by the pandemic is expected to increase by fivefold in the next 24 hours. Also, there are unsubstantiated reports of black market cotoxil being sold all over the city. At this moment, the mayor's office says it is desperate. It has never seen a crisis... hey. Hey. I can't stand watching this a minute longer. Me, neither. I brought lunch. Thought it might be better than going out. Thanks. Where's gil? He's in his room. [coughing] You ok? I'm fine. I just have a little cold, that's all. Come on, I haven't even been anywhere that... aw, damn, you know what? I forgot... I've got a deposition. On saturday? It might go late. I'll see you later. I don't think so. Goodbye, frank. [cell phone ringing] Hello? Hello? Who is this? How did you get in here? Relax. Relax. He knows it's me! He's probably gonna have me killed, and with the quarantine, I can't even run. I can keep you safe. How? By putting him away forever. What if the governor goes for his deal? And don't tell me she's not considering it. We have to get to him before she does. Look. Vicente still needs you to represent him. When he calls, you tell him the governor has agreed, but you tell him that there are papers he needs to sign. I don't know. Maybe he has to agree to sin no more. Then you call me. I'll be right behind you. It will never work. He won't believe me. You make him believe you. You know, when this thing gets out, my career will be over. No one will know about this except me and one other agent. There will be no other swat teams, no other cops. I will do my best to keep your name out of it completely. [overlapping chatter] [gasping] [monitor beeping] Oh, my god. Nurse! Nurse! [coughing] Code blue, code blue. Ma'am, can you hear us? Ma'am, can you hear us? Non-responsive. Sweetie, sweetie, it's ok. It's all right. It's ok. She just died. She wasn't very strong. You're a lot stronger, ok? You need to remember that. I don't feel that strong. I know. Listen to me, brooke. You and I are gonna walk out of here together. Ok? I want you to remember that. Ok. What's the take? A million 6 and counting. That's why they call this the land of opportunity. One minute I'm headed to death row, the next I'm making millions with a full pardon. God, I love this country. I haven't seen her for two days. I'll let you in, but you're on your own. It feels like the end of the world to me, but I know that it's not. It's the just the end of mine. The sun will come out, lovers will marry, children will play, life will be lived. To whoever finds this, please pass it on to my 3 children, ashley, trace, and daniel. Make sure the photo album and the letters have been disinfected so they won't throw them away. Tell them I do forgive them for being scared. I'm sorry it had to end this way. And somebody please take care of robert and ida. They're not much trouble. Mom. Ok. He's turning around. Keep it moving, sir. Keep it moving. Get your packs and push out about 100 meters. I'm telling you, this road is shut down all the way to route 34. Why is that? I live just down the road. Ok, guys. Get set. This is it. Got it. Right behind you. [honks horn] I'm sorry, ma'am. Where do I go? What do you want me to do? There are no exceptions. [honking] Hey. What is your problem, pal? Good morning, sergeant. I need for you to move this truck, sir. You know this quarantine is illegal, right? What I know is that you got to move this truck now. Make me! Hey! Halt! Halt! [tires squeal] Aah! Halt! 0-6, this is charlie 1-1. We got a problem here. 3 vehicles just broke through the barricade. We did not engage. Over. Excuse me. I just got word that 3 vehicles broke through the quarantine on the ventura line. Did they fire? No. They're the governor's troops. The governor should make the call. It's not your responsibility. It's hers. I can't see killing people just because they don't want to get sick. Good afternoon. I'm speaking to you today from the office of your mayor michael dellasandro. I'm here because I believe strongly that there is no justice without security. Although we believe in the rule of law, the law is not effective if it is only words. I have issued an executive order imposing martial law. A dawn-till-dusk curfew will be enforced, and I've ordered the national guard to preserve the quarantine. Order and safety will prevail. Got that? Got it taken care of. Yes, sir. I understand. All right, guys. Listen up. We got new orders. Absolutely nobody gets past us. We shoot if we have to. [overlapping chatter] [coughing] How are you doing? May I? [camera shutter clicking] [coughing] [p.a. announcement] Thank you. [coughing] [p.a. announcement] [flatlining] [turns monitor off] [camera shutter clicking] [coughing] let me ask you something. Why are we surrounded by all these sick people? Well, maybe that's because you're a sick person. Hey, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, look, I feel fine. I fee fine. Trust me, the jack is back. Listen, I need you to do me a favor. I need to get my hands on a cell phone recharger. Think you could hook me up? Mr. hendler, we're here for our patients' medical needs. That's first and foremost. Now, if you want an exam, we'll give you an exam and we'll probably move you to another area at some point, but for right now, I think I would be grateful to be alive. This riptide thing, it's like a... it's like a whole neutron bomb or something, huh? The people, they just evaporate, but the buildings are still standing. I'm telling you, it's gonna be a buyer's market, my friend. Oh! All right. You see that room down there? Right there. Yeah, look there. He's there because you infected him, right? Just like you infected all the other people... Dozens, maybe hundreds of people, and now you want to sell their real estate? [p.a. announcement] Go back to your room. Iaker-7, I'm in a restaurant at 983 w. Olive. Piece of junk. Come on. We're undercover. What do you care? Testing 1, 2, 3. His wire's hot. How you doing, counselor? Fine. Where's vicente? What do you got here? Maserati? I like this. What's something like this go for? Cut the crap. Vicente's supposed to be here. Where is he? You got the documents? Yeah, I got them right here, but they're for his eyes only. Well, he thought he couldn't trust you. You know what? Neither do i. What are you doing? What? You wearing a wire? Leave me alone, man. [gunshot] let's go. [tires squealing] Damn it! Oh, no. Unh! Unh! I'm hit. I'll get you to a hospital. Hang on! Just hold on! Keep pressure on that thing! [grunting] [overlapping chatter] So what are you hearing? It could be up to 6,000 dead, and we may have at least that many sick at home. These people aren't receiving any kind of organized medical care. 6,000? Jeez. That seems high. Yeah. Why don't they come in? They might be too sick to want to move. Maybe we just can't get to them 'cause the ambulance services and e.r.s are overwhelmed. Just got a call from coroner. And? Dr. tam wants to know when he can start the cremations and mass burials. He's running out of space for the bodies. [overlapping chatter] That was an update from this morning. Oh. It was. Hello? Hey. Just want to check up on you guys, make sure you're ok. We're good. [coughing] You sound distracted. Anything going on? You're all right? No. No. We're fine here. Maybe I should talk to your mother. Put her on. She's sleeping. Ok. Well, uh, you tell her I called. You make sure, ok? Yeah. See you, dad. See you, buddy. [wheezing] Mom? Mom? [tires squealing] You ok, mister? Mister? Don't shoot, don't shoot! Get in the car. Get in. Close the door. Drive the car. Drive. [beeping] [gun cocks] Whoa, kid, take it easy, all right? I'm really sorry, but I need that money. Look, man, I can't. My mom's sick. Please. Just-just give me the money. Wait, wait, wait. Just don't come any closer. That's right, sir. Just turn it around. Bring it up, ma'am. No, ma'am. You're gonna have to turn around. No, ma'am. No further traffic this direction. You can't mess with the national guard. Some of the guys have been in iraq. Listen to me. This guy comes up here, act like you're gonna do what he says. He's gonna tell you to turn around. You take off. If you don't do what I say, I will kill you. Do you understand me? Ok. The road's closed, sir. You're gonna have to turn it around. Ok. Watch out! Watch out! Get up there! Hold your fire. [tires squealing] Watch the rest. Watch the rest! I got a shot! Take it. He's getting away! Secure that vehicle. Follow me. Let me see your hands! Get doc moore up here now! Get the flex cuffs on him. Ok. It's probably him right there. I'll be back. Gsw. He's stable, but they're holding him for interview with fbi. Over. [radio dispatch] We got a call from headquarters about your fugitive. Based on the description, I think this is your guy. Good work. Excuse me, guys. Can I have a moment, please? Let's clear out, guys. He's cuffed to the gurney. Where is he? I got nothing to say to you. I got my rights. I want my lawyer. Too late. You killed him. I didn't kill nobody. He grabbed for my gun. It was an accident. Yeah. Pretty good story. Who knows? A jury might even believe it if you ever get to tell it. Ooh. A little nasty wound you got there. Unh! I'd say this thing needs some serious attention. And the lines at the hospital are real long. You wait your turn, you could bleed out. You know who I am? I'm the guy who can get you to the front. It's your choice. [overlapping chatter] [p.a. announcement] [coughing] [p.a. announcement] Hey. I guess I fought it off as long as I could. I'm so sorry. Do you mind? [clicking] Thanks. No. Please take good care of it. I will. I promise. Get some rest, ok? [p.a. announcement] [crying] Though unsubstantiated by state and city authorities, we now have information from a knowledgeable source that tells us that the city's temporary morgues are filled beyond capacity. Mass graves have been dug for the incineration and burial of the dead. The current death toll due to the riptide virus is now in the thousands and growing. All on-duty interns, report to nurse's station. All on duty interns, report to nurse's station. [p.a. announcement] You're awake. [p.a. announcement] How's aria? You know her? She took my picture. She does that a lot. [coughs] You should, uh, you should go back to sleep, sweetie. You need your rest. Aunt kayla? Yeah? You can't save everyone, can you? No, baby, I can't. Thanks for trying. [p.a. announcement] When the avenues of approach are secure, we'll move to assault. A group dynamic takedown with c-2 coordination from my van. Let me know if you need any more black and whites for the cordon. Fill in harbor p.d., and I'll be right over. I got a swat team in position. They're ready to move in that building when I give the word. No. Give me 5 minutes to get inside and neutralize him. Like hell. My boys are gonna get him out of there. He knows we got him for murder. I don't think he's walking out peacefully. So we carry him out. The cdc needs him alive. Any suggestions? You just give me 5 minutes. Then you can do what you want, but you don't move till I give the signal. 5 minutes. Ok. Hey. Where's your mask? I don't need one. Vicente's not sick. But I thought he was on that plane. He was. That's why I need him alive. What are we gonna do if he tries? Makes his own nest. You know what? I'm sick of it. Ha ha ha! All right. All you got to do is try. Nothing from smoke? No. I think we got a problem. I'll get the guys. He doesn't show in 15 minutes, we get those trucks out of here. [gun cocks] Oh, it's you. Hands in the air where I can see them. I got the rat. Let's move in on the rest. [sighs] [handcuffs latch] let's go! Hey! It's going down! Hey! They're coming! Move up! Ohh! Move up! All right. The building's surrounded. Drop the weapon now. On your knees now! Let's get those trucks out here now. Come on! Trucks coming in. Let's move! Let's clear this area right now! [sirens] Something's happening! We're live. We're live! Look over my shoulder. This is a live picture. These are the semis bringing in the stolen cotoxil. Hey! Where we going? Come on. It's here right now at the emergency response center. An incredible picture. You're watching this live. This is what the center's been waiting for. We're back at the emergency response center. What... what is all this? I got a surprise for the two of you. Ok. Come on. You got to see this. This is the best news the emergency response... I figured you could use this stuff. You're kidding. We got it. We got as much of it back as we could. This is great! Good job. This is melissa lowe reporting. It appears that the stolen antiviral cotoxil has been recovered. Two truckloads have just arrived here at the emergency response center and are now in the safe hands of cdc officials. [overlapping chatter] We have recovered the stolen cotoxil. Now this does not mean we're out of the woods, not by any stretch. It does mean we have a tool to help slow down the virus. I do have to remind you all that this is not a cure, but it does buy us some valuable time. Mom? Mom! What? What? Gil. Mom. God, you scared me. Honey, I'm just tired. Here. You gotta take these. What? What? [coughing] what is it? It's that cotoxil stuff. You gotta take 'em. Gil, what have you done? Here, take it. Oh. [coughing] Mom? [coughing] Mom? [coughing] See anything? No. Nothing. Ok. We're gonna take, um, 4-hours shifts. Tell, uh... tell them to take the first one. Yeah. Donny, scott, you guys have the first shift. Tell those guys to get some rest back there. [coughing] Ok, russ? [coughing] Get back, get back. Nobody touches him. Stay away from him. You're kidding me. [coughing] Finally. I didn't know how much longer I could stand being around him without... I'm sorry. Any luck? Nothing. I just don't get it. I mean, he was sitting as close to ames as anyone. Hopefully, I'll find something out with his medical history. Good luck. This is dr. Martin. She's here... I know who she is. You look much prettier without your space suit. We don't have a lot of time here. Oh. Well, that's unfortunate because all I've got is time. You want me to tell you why I'm still alive, it's gonna cost you. What do you want? What any man in my position would want, a full pardon. No way. That's off the table. I want my lawyer. Oh. I forgot to tell you. He's dead. Your boy smoke wasted him. So here's the deal. If the cdc can confirm that any information you give them actually saves lives, we'll drop the death penalty. You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in a federal prison? Then you'll die. Oh, but we're all gonna die. Yeah, but let me tell you what your life is gonna be like while you wait to die. [whispering] You've got 10 seconds. 5. You're out of time. Let's go, doctor. When I was in australia waiting for the feds, they tested a flu vaccine at my prison. Yeah. Well, we know. It was manufactured in denmark, but you never got the vaccine. I mean, that's what it said in the prison medical log. That's because you looked under edward vicente. They gave the prisoners random numbers, and I didn't get picked. Those that got picked wore those bracelets that got you better food for a month, so I just convinced a guy to let me take his place. So you got the shot, the food, the benefits. What did this other guy get? He got to live. I got to go. [overlapping chatter] Kayla! Yeah. What? I just put brooke on a respirator. [p.a. announcement] Brooke. Brooke. Brooke, sweetie. You got to open your eyes. Come on. Listen to me. You got to be strong. You got to fight this. All right? You have to give me a little time. Just give me a little time. That's good. Thank you, sweetie. Please just let me know if there's any more changes. Where you going? I think I found a link. Negative. Has no effect. That's impossible. Well, look for yourself. The danish vaccine doesn't work on our virus. I really thought we had it. Well, we've been wrong before. I just don't understand. I mean, out of all the people that were sitting next to ames, how could vicente still be alive? We have to be missing something. Well, whatever it is, I can't see it. I don't know. There has to be something. I really believe it. Is there a discrepancy in his antigenic and immunogenicity profile? What are you doing? Going through vicente's medical file again. Let's see. There must be something here. Huh. What? Kayla, I just got word from ratner. The people who broke out of quarantine just turned themselves in. Oh, thank god. One of them is dead, someone from flight 182... gibson smolak. The rest are being brought here so we can keep an eye on them. Ok. Come here. I did an epithelial and lung lining test. The virus, it didn't attach. Come here. Take a look. Then I watched for changes in the proinflammatory cascades. They're normal. Yeah. There's no organ shutdown. It works. Yeah. How much of the blood do we have left? You mean vicente's? Yeah. Ah. Not much. Enough for a single dose? Maybe. Clean it. Gonna use it on someone? Are you gonna clean it, or am I? Great. [p.a. announcement] She's... she's gonna be ok. [sobs] For so long, all I've heard is "auntie kayla did this" and auntie kayla did that," and now... thank you. Thank you. You're certain this is what saved the young girl? Absolutely. Ok. Let me get this straight. You want me to allow you to give tuberculosis to the entire population of los angeles? We're not actually giving them t.b. we're giving them the antibodies that were created to fight the t.b. it prevents the virus from attaching itself to the lungs. But why not just give people t.b. medication? Because if they haven't had an active case of t.b., the response won't create the right profile of cytokines and chemokines to kill the virus. How do we do this? We need you to put in the word out in the media that we're seeking people who have an active, treated case of t.b. to go to their local hospitals. And then you take their blood? Only a part of their blood, and then we filter it and wash it and use it to treat the population. Now the beauty of this is, 1,000 people who have had their active tuberculosis treated will give us as much as a million doses. How long? A couple of days. We'll use the fire stations for distribution. They're in every neighborhood. That's a good idea. You should make the announcement. We'll both make the announcement. Great. Here you go. Just take this and fill it out. Thank you very much. I'm gonna take you back first, and then I'll come back and get you, ok? Ok. Great. Thanks. I got some good news and I got some bad news. Bad. Good first. Your mom's gonna make it. Awesome! So the medicine worked? Not really. She never had the virus. She's got pneumonia. Plain, old antibiotics cured her. That's great. Now for the bad news. Your little atm robbery was caught on camera. I'm really sorry, dad. I know. You were just trying to help your mom. So, am I gonna get locked up? Look, a lot of people did things they weren't proud of, out of caring for others or out of panic. I spoke to the gentleman, and he's willing to drop the charges, but you gotta pay him back. So, you're gonna pay him back, understand? Thanks, dad. Do you want to help me make some dinner? Ok. It's over. [overlapping chatter] Ok. Ok. I've just been told we're going now live to city hall, where mayor dellasandro and governor schaefer are about to make a statement. [camera shutters clicking] Ios angeles has always had its share of trials and natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, and now this riptide virus, but we are a strong city full of strong people. Governor. Today, we have hope to go with that strength. A treatment has been found that will buy us the time necessary to develop a lasting vaccine. It is a blessing within a curse, but it will soon be available to us all. In moments like this, there are always many people to thank, our first responders, our police, firemen, and paramedics, people who put the lives and safety of others above their own. Our doctors, nurses, cdc scientists, and all the other health professionals, who have stood firm in the face of this tragedy. We will always be profoundly grateful. This tragedy has taught us a great deal. We've learned that in unity there is strength. But we have paid an enormous price. Many have died, and many more are still struggling for life. We will remember those who have served and lost. We will fight in their names to make our federal government update and support modern methods of viral vaccines and treatments. They must be made to see that if it can happen here it can happen anywhere. If it can happen to us, it can happen to them. [p.a. announcement] Hey. Aunt kayla. [sighs] How you feeling? See? I told you you were gonna walk out of here. It's just gonna be in a couple days. You really mean it? Yeah, I really mean it. You have to practice for next year's trials, right? I, uh, have a little surprise for you. [p.a. announcement] Hey, my baby. You look great. I missed you. I missed you, too. I love you, baby. I love you, too. [overlapping chatter] Hey. How you doing? [sighs] Tired, but I'm good. How are you? Exhausted. I, uh... wow... I just got a call. A promotion in atlanta. I'm not surprised. You going? Nah. Leave this paradise? Where you headed now? Home. Get some sleep. Come on. I'll walk you to your car. Ok. Thanks. Heh. Well, since you're staying, we should get a cup of coffee sometime. Well, you have my number. Yes, I do. Heh.
