A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X... No! Mama... No! Mama! I said no, Boolie, and that's the end of it. It's a miracle you're not laying in Emory hospital or decked out at the funeral home! Look at you, you didn't even bump your head. Well, it was the car's fault. Mama, the car didn't just back over the driveway and land on the Pollards' garage all by itself! You had it in the wrong gear! I did not! You put it in reverse instead of drive! The police report shows that. Well, you should have let me keep my Lasalle. Your Lasalle was 8 years old. I don't care. It never would have behaved this way, and you know it. Mama, cars don't behave. They are behaved upon. The fact is you, all by yourself, demolished that packard. Well, think what you want. I know the truth. The truth is, you shouldn't be allowed to drive a car anymore. No! Mama, we are just going to have to hire somebody to drive you. No, we are not! Now, this is my business! Your insurance policy is written so that they are going to have to give you a brand-new car. Not another packard, I hope. Oh, lord almighty! Don't you see what I'm saying? Oh, quit talking so ugly to your mother! Mama, you are 72 years old and you just cost the insurance company $2,700. You are a terrible risk. Nobody is going to issue you a policy after this. You are just saying that to be hateful. Ok, yes--yes, I am. I'm making it all up. Every insurance company in america is lined up in the driveway waving their fountain pens and falling all over themselves to get you to sign on. Everybody wants Daisy Werthan, the only woman in the history of driving to demolish a 3-week-old packard, a two-car garage, and a free-standing tool shed in one fell swoop! You talk so foolish sometimes, Boolie. And even if you could get a policy somewhere, it wouldn't be safe! I'd worry all the time. Look at how many of your friends have men to drive them! Miss ida Jacobs, miss Ethel hess, aunt nonie-- well, they're all rich! Daddy left you plenty enough for this. I'll do the interviewing at the plant. Oscar in the freight elevator knows every colored man in Atlanta worth talking about. And I'm sure in two weeks' time I can find you somebody perfectly suitable-- no! You won't even have to do anything, mama. I told you, I'll do all the interviewing-- no! Now, stop running your mouth. I am a 72-year-old woman, as you so gallantly reminded me, and I'm a widow. But unless they rewrote the constitution and didn't tell me, I've still got rights! And one of my rights is the right to invite who I want-- not who you want-- into my house. Now, you do accept the fact that this is my house? And what I don't want-- and absolutely will not have is some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen, gobbling up my food, running up my phone bill. Oh, I hate that in my house! You have idella. Oh, idella is different. I mean, she's been coming to me 3 times a week since you was in the eighth grade, and we know how to stay out of each other's way. Even so, there are nicks and chips in most of my kitchen China, and I have seen her throw, you know, silver forks into the garbage more than once. Do you think idella has a vendetta against your silverware? Oh, stop being sassy. Now, you know what I mean. I mean, on forsyth street, we couldn't afford them to do for us. We did for ourselves. And that's still the best way, if you ask me. "Them"? You sound like governor talmadge. Why, Boolie! What a thing to say! I am not prejudiced, and you know it. I've got to go home. Florine will be having a fit. Oh, y'all have plans for tonight? Going to the ansleys for a dinner party. Oh, I see. You see what? The ansleys. I'm quite sure florine bought another new dress. I mean, this is her idea of heaven on earth, isn't it? What? Socializing with episcopalians. You are a doodle, mama. I guess aunt nonie can run you anywhere you need to go for the time being. I'll be fine. I'll stop by tomorrow evening. Well, how do you know I'll be here? I'm not dependent on you for company. Fine. I'll call first. And I still intend to interview colored men! No! God... OK, miss mcclatchey, send 'em on in! Yes, uh... Hoke, isn't it? Yes, sir! Hoke colburn. Have a seat there. I've got to sign these letters. I don't want Miss McClatchey Fussing at me. Keep right on with it. I got all the time in the world. I see. How long you been out of work? Since back befo' last November. Long time. Well, Mr. Werthan, you try being me and looking for work. They hiring young if they hiring colored, and they ain't even hiring much young, seems like. Mr. Werthan? Uh-huh? Y'all people Jewish, ain't ya? Yes, we are. Why do you ask? I'd druther drive for Jews. People always talkin' 'bout, "they stingy," and, "they cheap," but don't say none of that 'round me. Good to know you feel that way. Now, tell me where you worked before. Yes, sir! That's just what I'm gettin' at! One time... I workin' for this woman over near little five points. What was that woman's name? I forget. Anyway, she the president of the ladies auxiliary over yonder to the ponce de Leon baptist church, and seem like she always bringing up god and Jesus and "do unto others." You know what I'm talkin' bout? I'm not sure. Go on. Well, one day, Mr. Werthan, one day that woman say to me, she say "hoke, come on back in the back with me. I got something for you." And we go on back yonder and, lord have mercy, she have all these old shirts and collars be on the bed-- yellow, you know, and nasty, like they been stuck off in a chifforobe and forgot about. That's right. And she say, "ain't they nice? "They belonged to my daddy befo' he pass, and we fixin' to sell 'em to you for 25 cent apiece." What was her name? That's what I'm thinking-- what was that woman's name? Anyway, as I was goin' on to say, any fool see the whole bunch of them collars and shirts together ain't worth a nickel. And them the people calling Jews cheap! So, I say, "yes'm, I think about it." And I get me another job fast as I can. Where was that? Mr. Harold Stone. Jewish gentleman, just like you. A judge. Live over yonder on lullwater road. I knew judge Stone! You don't say! He done give me this suit when he finish with it, see? And this necktie, too. You drove for judge Stone?! Seven years to the day, near about. And I'd be there still if he didn't die, and miss Stone decide to close up the house and move to her people in Savannah. And she said, "come on down to Savannah with me, hoke." 'Cause my wife dead by then. And I say, "no, thank you." I didn't want to leave my grandbabies, and I don't get along with that geechee trash they got down there. Judge Stone was a friend of my father's. You don't mean! Oscar say you need a driver for yo' family. Now, what I be doin'? Runnin' yo' children to school and yo' wife to the beauty parlor and like dat? I don't have any children. But tell me-- that's a shame! My daughter best thing ever happen to me. But you young yet-- I wouldn't worry none. I won't, thank you. Did you have a job after judge Stone? I--i drove a milk truck for the avondale dairy through the whole war-- the one just was. Hoke... What I'm looking for is somebody to drive my mother around. Uh, now... Excuse me for asking, but how comes she ain't hire for herself? Well, it's a delicate situation. Uh-huh. She done gone round the bend a little. That'll happen when they get on. Oh, no, nothing like that. She's all there-- too much there is the problem. It just isn't safe for her to drive anymore. She knows it but she won't admit it. I'll be frank with you, I'm a little desperate. Oh, I know what you mean by that! One time I was out of work and my wife said to me, "oh, hoke, you ain't gonna get no 'nother job." And I say "what you talking about, woman?" And the very next week I go to work for that woman in little five points. Cahill! Miss Frances Cahill. And then I go to judge Stone, and they the reason I so happy to hear you Jews. Hoke, I want you to understand, my mother is a little high-strung. She doesn't want anybody driving her. But the fact is, you'd be working for me. She can say anything she likes but she can't fire you. You understand? Sho' I do! Don't worry none about it. I'll hold on no matter what way she run me. When I was nothin' but a little boy down there on the farm above macon, I used to wrestle hogs to the ground at killin' time, and ain't no hog get away from me yet. How does $20 a week sound? Sound like you got your mama a chauffeur. Morning, miss Daisy. Good morning. Right cool in the night, wasn't it? I wouldn't know, I was asleep. Yes'm. What your plans today? Uh, that's my business. You're right about that. Idella say we running out of coffee and Dutch cleanser. "We"? She--she say we low on silver Polish, too. Thank you. I will go to the piggly wiggly on the trolley this afternoon. Now, miss Daisy, how come you don't let me carry you? No, thank you. Ain't that what Mr. Werthan hire me for? That's his problem. All right, then. I'll find something to do. I tend those zinnias. You leave my flower bed alone. Yes'm. You got a nice place back beyond the garage ain't doing nothing but sitting there. I could put you in some butterbeans and some tomatoes and even some Irish potatoes. Could we get some ones with good eyes. If I want a vegetable garden, I'll plant it myself. Well, I'll go out and set in the kitchen, then, like I been doing all week. Don't you be talking to idella. She got work to do. Oh, no'm. I just sit there till 5:00. Hmm, well, that's your affair. Seem a shame, though. That fine oldsmobile sitting out there in the garage, ain't move an inch from when Mr. Werthan rode it over here from Mitchell motors. It's only got 19 miles on it. Seem like that insurance company give you a whole new car for nothing. That's your opinion. Yes'm, and my other opinion is a fine rich Jewish lady like you don't belong dragging up the steps of no bus, lugging no grocery store bags. I come along and carry 'em for you. I don't need you, I don't want you, and I don't like you saying I'm rich. I won't say it, then. Is that what you and idella talk about in the kitchen? Oh, I hate this. I hate being discussed behind my back in my own house. Now, I was born on forsyth street, and, believe you me, I knew the value of a penny. My brother Manny brought home a white cat one day and papa said we couldn't keep it because we couldn't afford to feed it. Now, my sisters saved up so that I could go to school and be a teacher. We didn't have anything. Yes'm, but look like you're doing all right now. And I've traveled on the trolley to the piggly wiggly plenty of times. Yes'm, but I feel bad taking Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing, you understand? How much he pay you? That between me and him, miss Daisy. Anything over $7.00 a week is robbery. Highway robbery. Especially when I don't do nothing but sit on a stool in the kitchen all day long. I tell you what--while you going on the trolley to the piggly wiggly, I hose down your front steps. All right. All right, I hose your steps. To the piggly wiggly and then home, nowhere else. Yes'm. Mm-hmm! Uh--oh, wait! You don't know how to run the oldsmobile. Miss Daisy, a gear shift like a third arm to me. Anyway, this one-- automatic! Any fool can run it. Well, any fool but me, apparently. There's no need for you to be so hard on yourself now--you can't drive, but you probably do a lot of things I can't do. Mm-hmm. It'll all work out. I'm going to the-- to the market, idella. And I right behind her! I love a new car smell, don't you? Mm-hmm. I'm nobody's fool, hoke. No'm. I can see the speedometer as well as you can. I see that. My husband taught me how to run a car. Yes'm. And I still remember everything he told me. So, don't you even think for one second--wait! You're speeding! I see it. We ain't going but 19 miles an hour. I like to go under the speed limit. The speed limit 35 here. Mm-hmm. The slower you go, the more you save on gas. My husband told me that. We're barely moving. Might as well walk to the piggly wiggly. Is this your car? No'm. You pay for the gas? No'm. All right. My fine son may think that I am losing my abilities, but I am still in control of what goes on in my car. Well, where you going? To the grocery store. Well, why didn't you turn on highland Avenue? Well, piggly wiggly ain't on highland Avenue. It on euclid, down there. I know where it is, and I want to go the way I always go, on highland Avenue. That's 3 blocks out the way, miss Daisy. Well, go back, go back this minute! We in the wrong Lane. I can't go back. Go back, I said, or i'm gonna get out of this car. We're moving! You can't open that door! Oh, oh, this is wrong, this is wrong. Where you taking me? The store. What, no, this is wrong! You have to go back to highland Avenue. I've been driving to the piggly wiggly ever since they put it up and opened it for business. Now, this isn't the way. Go back. Go back this minute! Yonder the piggly wiggly. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well... get--get ready to turn. Yes'm. Ooh, watch out! There's a little boy behind that shopping cart. I see that. Oh, oh, all right. Pull over next to this blue car. We closer to the door right here. Next to the blue car, I said. I don't park in the sun. It fades the upholstery. Yes'm, yes'm. Ah, just a minute. Give me the keys. Yes'm. Mm-hmm. Now, you stay right here by the car, and you don't have to tell everybody my business. No'm. Don't forget the Dutch cleanser now! HELLO? MISS McCLATCHEY? Hoke colburn here. Can I speak to him? Morning, sir, Mr. Werthan. Guess where I'm at? I'm at this here phone booth on euclid Avenue right next to the piggly wiggly. I just drove your mama to the market. Oh, she--she flap a little on the way but she all right. Sir? Oh, she in the store. Uh-ho. Miss Daisy look out the store window and don't see me, she is liable to pitch a fit right there by the checkout. Yes, sir, only took 6 days. Same time it take the lord to make the world. ♪ May the words of my mouth ♪ and the meditations of my heart ♪ be acceptable in thy sight ♪ o lord ♪ my rock ♪ and my redeemer ♪ amen How your temple this morning, miss Daisy? Why are you here? I bring you to the temple like you tell me. Yeah, well, I'll get myself in. Just go. Hurry up out of here. Yes'm. I didn't say speed, I said, get me away from here. Something wrong back yonder? No. Something I done? No... yes. I ain't done nothing. You had the car right in front of the front door of the temple like I was the queen of Romania! I mean, everybody saw you. Didn't I tell you to wait for me in the back? I just trying to be nice. There were two other chauffeurs right behind me. Yeah, well, you made me look like a fool, a g.D. Fool. Lord knows you ain't no fool, miss Daisy. I mean, Miriam and beulah and them, I could see what they was thinking. What that? That I'm trying to pretend I'm rich. You is rich, miss Daisy. No, I'm not. And nobody can ever say that I put on airs. I mean, on forsyth street, we only had meat once a week. I mean, we did with grits and gravy. Well, I taught fifth grade at the crew street school. I mean, I, I did without plenty of times, I can tell you. And now you're doing with. What's so terrible in that? Oh, you. I can't talk to you. You don't understand me. No'm, I don't. I truly don't, 'cause if I ever was to get a hold of what you got, I'd be shaking it around for everybody in the world to see! That is vulgar! Don't talk to me. God dog it, now, you vulgar fool. Oh, oh, oh, what was that? Oh, I heard what you just said. Miss Daisy, you needs a chauffeur, and lord knows I needs this job. Let's just leave it at that. Good morning, mama. What is the matter? What? Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're talking so fast I can't understand you. What? What, i-- oh... oh, all right, all right. I'll come by on my way to work. I-- I'll be there soon as I can! God! I didn't expect to find you in one piece. I wanted you to be here. I wanted you to hear it for yourself. Hear what? What is going on? He's stealing from me. Hoke? Are you sure? I don't make empty accusations. I have proof. What proof? This. Aha. I caught him red-handed. I found this buried in the garbage pail under some coffee grounds. You mean he stole a can of salmon? Well, here it is. Oh, I knew. I knew something was funny. I mean, they all take things, you know, so I counted. You counted? Well, the silverware first and then the linen table napkins. And then I went into the pantry. And when I turned on the light, the first thing that caught my eye was a hole behind the corned beef. There were only 8 cans of salmon and I bought 9. 3 for a dollar on sale. Ha ha! Very clever, mama! You made me miss my breakfast and be late for a meeting at the bank for a 33-cent can of salmon! Here, here. You want 33 cents? Here's a dollar. Here's $10--buy a pantry full of salmon! The very idea! I mean, waving money at me like I don't know-- I don't want the money! I want my things! One can of salmon?! It was mine! I bought it! And I put it there! And he went into my pantry and he took it, and he never said a word. I mean, I leave him plenty of food every day and I always tell him exactly what it is. I mean, it is like having little children in the house. I mean, they want something, so they just take it. Oh, no, not a smidgen of manners, no conscience. He'll never admit to this. "Oh, no'm", he'll say. "I don't know nothin' about that." Well, I don't like it! I don't like that in my house. I have no privacy. Mama! Oh, go ahead and defend him. You always do. All right! I give up. You want to drive yourself again, you just go ahead and arrange it with the insurance company. Take your blessed trolley. Buy yourself a taxicab. Anything you want. Just leave me out of it. Boolie, Boolie! Morning, miss Daisy. Hey! Whoa. Excuse me, I didn't know you was here, Mr. Werthan. Hoke... I think we have to have a talk. Just a minute now. Let me put my coat away. I'll be right back. Miss Daisy, yesterday, when you was out with your sister, I ate a can of your salmon. Now, I know you say eat the leftover pork chops, but they stiff. Here, I done buy you another can. You want me to put it in the pantry for you? Yes... thank you, hoke. Be right back, Mr. Werthan. Good-bye, son. Ha ha! Huh. I just thinking, miss Daisy-- we've been out here to this cemetery 3 times this month already. It ain't even the twentieth yet. It--it's nice to come when the weather's fine. Yes'm. Mr. Sig--his grave is mighty well tended. I believe you the best widow in the state of Georgia. Well, Boolie's always after me to let the staff out here tend to this plot. "Perpetual care," they call it. Oh, don't you do it. It right to have somebody from the family looking after you. Yeah, well, I'll certainly never have that. Boolie will have me in perpetual care before I'm cold. Oh, come on now, miss Daisy. Uh, hoke, take that pot of azaleas for me and set them on Leo Bauer's grave. Miss Rose Bauer's husband? Yeah, that's right. She asked me to bring it out here for her, and she's not very good about coming. I think, uh, it's--it's somewhere over there, on--i think it's his birthday today, to be truthful. Where the grave at? Uh, w--well, I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's over that way. On the other side of that weeping cheery tree there. Uh-huh. You'll see the headstone. It says "Bauer" on it. Yes'm. Well, what's the matter? Nothing the matter. Miss Daisy... I told you--yeah, I told you, it's on the other side of that weeping cherry tree there. And--and it says "Bauer" on the headstone. How would that look? Uh, what are you talking about? I'm talking about, I can't read. What? I can't read. Oh, that's ridiculous. Anybody could read. No. Not me. Well, how--how come I see you looking at the paper every morning? That's it, just looking. I dope out what's happening from the pictures. Y--you know your letters, don't you? MY ABCs? YES'M, PRETTY GOOD. I just can't read! Oh, stop saying that. It's making me mad. Now, look, if you know your letters, then you can read. Look, ah, you just don't know what you can read. I've taught some of the stupidest children god ever put on the face of this earth. And all of them could read enough to find a name on a tombstone. Now, the name is Bauer. Buh, buh, buh--Bauer. Now, what is that "buh" letter sound? Sound like a "b." Of--of course. Buh, Bauer. B-Bauer. "Er." now that's the second part. Now, what does that "er" sound like? Er. "R," "r." Er, er, er, "r." "R." So, the first letter is a-- "b." And the last letter is an "r." "R." "B," "r"; "B," "r"; "B," "r"; "B," "r." Brr, bbb, bbb, bbb, brr, brr, brr. It even sounds like "Bauer," doesn't it? Does it? That's it. Now, you go over there like I told you in the first place, and you find a headstone that has a "b" at the beginning and an "r" at the end, and that'll be Bauer. We ain't gonna worry about what come in the middle? That'll be enough for you to find it. Yes'm. Now, go on, now. And don't you come back here telling me you can't do it, 'cause you can. Miss Daisy? Uh-oh. What now? I appreciate this, miss Daisy. Oh, don't be ridiculous. I didn't do anything. Now, would you please hurry up because I am burning up out here? All right, florine! I'm on the phone with her now! Mama, merry Christmas! Listen, do florine a favor, all right? No, no, no! She's having a fit and the grocery store is closed today. You got a package of coconut in your pantry? Would you bring it when you come? Hey, honey! Your ambrosia's saved! Mama's got the coconut! Many thanks. I will see you anon. Ha, mama! Ho ho ho! Ho! At them lit up decorations. Everybody's giving the Georgia power company a merry Christmas. Miss florine got 'em all beat with the lights. Oh, she makes an ass out of herself every year. Yes'm. I mean, she always has to hang a wreath in every window she's got. Uh-huh. Oh, and that silly Santa claus, you know, winking on the front door. I bet she have the biggest tree in Atlanta. Where'd you get 'em so large? Absurd. I mean, if I had a nose like florine, I wouldn't go round wishing anybody a merry Christmas. I enjoy Christmas at they house. Yeah. It's no wonder. You're the only Christian in the place. Except they got that new cook. Well, florine never could keep help. Of course, it's none of my affair. No'm. And all that running around-- garden club this and junior league that. I mean, as if any one of them would give her the time of day. She'd die before she'd fix a glass of iced tea for the temple sisterhood. Yes'm, you right. I just hope she don't decide to sing this year. ♪ Glo-o-o-o-oria I mean, she sounds like she got a bone stuck in her throat. You done say a mouthful, miss Daisy. You didn't have to bring me, you know. I mean, b--Boolie would have run me out. I know that. Well, why did you? That my business, miss Daisy. Hmm... ♪ And may ♪ all your christmases ♪ be white Oh! Lookie there. Miss florine done put a Rudolph reindeer in the dogwood tree. Oh! If her grandfather, old man freitag, could see that. Ha ha! What do you say? He--he'd jump out of his grave and snatch her bald-headed. Ha ha! Oh, ooh. Wait a minute, now. Now--now, this isn't a Christmas present. No'm. You, you know I don't give Christmas presents. I sure do. Yeah. I--i just happened to come across these this morning on my way out. Open it up. Ain't nobody ever give me a book. "Handwriting copy book, grade five." Yeah, yeah, well, i--i always taught out of these, and I saved a few. Yes'm. Uh, it's faded, but it works. Yes'm. Now, if you practice, you'll write nicely. Uh, but you have to practice. Now, I taught mayor hartsfield out of this same book. Thank you, miss Daisy. Now, now, it's not a Christmas present. No'm. No, Jews have no business giving Christmas presents. Uh, you don't--you don't have to yammer about this to florine and Boolie. No, this is strictly between you and me. Yes, yes, yeah. Oh, they seen us! Mr. Werthan done turn up the hi-fi. And I hope I don't spit up. Come on, now. Get a wiggle on! Just emptying the trash. Saturday, garbage day. Where's mama? She back in her room. What? And she say go on without her. I think she taking on about this. That's crazy! A car's a car. Yes, sir, but she done watch over this machine like a chickenhawk. One day we park in front of the dry cleaner down at the Plaza, and this white man, he looked like some kind of lawyer, banker-- dressed up real fine. But he done lay his satchel up on our car... While he open up his trunk, you know. And, oh, lord. What'd he do that for? Before I could stop her, your mama jump out the back door, run that man every which way. She--she is wicked about her paint job. Did she tell you this new car has air conditioning? She says she don't like no air cool. Say it give her the neck ache. Well, you know how mama fought me, but it's time for a trade. She's losing equity on this car. I bet both of you'll miss this old thing. Not me! Uh-uh. Oh, come on. You're the only one that's driven it all this time. Aren't you just a little sorry to see it g-- it ain't going nowhere. I done bought it. Ha ha! You did not! I just made the deal with Mr. Red Mitchell at the car place. For how much? That's for him and me to know. For god's sake. Why didn't you just buy it right from mama? You'd have saved money. Your mama in my business enough as it is. I ain't studyin' makin' no monthly car payments to her. This is mine the regular way. What? It's a good car, all right. I guess nobody knows that better than you. Best to ever come off the line. And this new one-- mm-hmm? Miss Daisy don't take to it, I let her ride in this here now and again. That's mighty nice of you. Well, we all doing what we can. Mm-hmm. Keep them ashes off my upholstery. Oh, oh, oh, oh! It's three after 7:00. Yes'm. You said we leaving at fifteen to 8:00. At the latest, I said. Now, what business you got dragging this here out the house by yourself? Well, who was here to help me? Miss Daisy, it don't take more than five minutes to load up the trunk. You fixing to break both your arm and your legs, too, before we even get out of Atlanta. Well, i-- you taking on too much. I hate leaving things till the last minute. What you talking about? You ready to go for the last week and a half. Here. Ain't that-- oh, no, don't tou-- no, don't touch that! That Mr. Walter's present? Uh, yes, but I'm gonna hold it. It's very fragile.

Oh, I'm sure that "my fair lady" is more important than your own flesh and blood. Mama! Oh, those christians will be mighty impressed. I can't talk to you when you're like this. I got to talk to hoke. Yeah, well, they expect us for a late supper in mobile. You'll be there. Well, they--they'll fix crab. I mean, they always fix great crab. Yeah.

What the difference? You don't never 'low me to turn it on. Oh, hush up. Good-bye. Bye-bye, dear. Bye. Good luck. Good god. Mmm mmm mmm mmm! Idella stuff eggs good. Mm-hmm, well, you stuff yourself good. I--i was just thinking about the first time i-- I went to mobile. It--it was Walter's wedding, 1888. 1888?! Yeah. You weren't nothing but a little child. Well, I was twelve. We went on the train. And I was so excited 'cause i'd--I'd never been on a train before. I'd never been in a wedding party, and I'd never seen the ocean! Papa said it wasn't the ocean, it--it was the--the Gulf of Mexico. Well, it was all the same to me. Mm-hmm. I remember, we were at a picnic somewhere. Eh, somebody must have taken us bathing. And--and I asked papa if I could dip my hand in the water. And he laughed. Ha ha! Be--because I was so timid, you know, and--ha ha! And--and then I tasted the salt water on my fingers. Silly, the things you remember, you know? No sillier than most of what folks remember. Uh-huh. Huh. You talk about first time-- I ever tell you about the first time I ever leave the state of Georgia? Uh, no, when was that? About 25 minutes back. Oh! You pulled my leg. That's right, first time. My daughter, she married to a Pullman Porter on the n.C. & St. Louis line, you know. And she all the time going-- Detroit, New York, St. Louis. Talking about snow up around her waist and riding in the subway car. And I says "well, that very nice, tommie Lee, but I just don't feel the need." So, this it, miss Daisy, and I got to tell you, Alabama ain't looking like much so far. It's--it's nicer on the other side of Montgomery. If you say so. Can I have one of these here peaches, ma'am? Oh, sure. Help yourself. Oh! Oh, my god. What happen? Oh, lord. We're-- we're going the wrong way. Oh. That--that signpost said 30 miles to phenix city. Well, we're--we're not supposed to go to phenix city! Maybe you done read it wrong. Oh no, no. No, no, I didn't. We'll turn around. Turn around. Oh, my god. Here. Just stop the car. Stop the car right-- right now. You--you see here? You took the wrong turn at opelika. Well, you took it with me and you reading the map! Oh. Well--we'll stop. We'll--we'll turn around. Turn around, turn around. It ain't been but 30 minutes since we turned. Oh. Oh my god. I'm such an idiot. Now, I never should have come in the car alone with you. It was Boolie's fault. I--i should have taken the train. I mean, I'd be safe on the train. I--i just should have taken the train. Yes'm, you should have. ♪ And when I'm gone ♪ and at my grave you stand ♪ just say god's called home ♪ you ramblin' man oh, they fixed crab for us. I mean, minnie always fixes crab. I mean, they go to so much trouble. And... Now--now it's all ruined. Oh, lord. We've got to pull over, miss Daisy. Oh, is there something wrong with the car now? Oh, no'm. I've got to be excused. What? I've got to make water. Well, why didn't you think of that back at the standard oil station? Colored can't use the toilet at no standard oil, you know that. Well, we can't stop now. We'll be in mobile soon. You can wait. Yes'm. Yeah. Yeah. No'm. I said, you can wait! Yes, ma'am. I heard you! How do you think I feel having to ask you, when can I make my water? Like I some damn dog. Well, I'd be ashamed, hoke. I ain't no dog, and I ain't no child. And I ain't just the back of the neck you look at while you're going wherever you want to go. I a man nearly 72 years old! And I know when my bladder full. And I getting out this car and going off down the road like I got to do. And I'm taking the car key this time, and that's the end of it. Hoke! Hoke! Hoke? Hoke? Ohh... Well, hoke! Isn't this your day off? To what do I owe this honor? We got to talk. What is it? Well... It Mr. Sinclair Harris. My cousin sinclair? His wife. Jeanette? The one talk funny? She's from canton, Ohio. Yes, sir. Well, she trying to hire me. What? She phone when she know miss Daisy would be out. And she say... "How are they treating you, hoke?" You know how she sound like her nose stuff up. I say, "fine." She say, "well, if you're looking for a change, you know where to call." I'll be damned. I thought you want to know about it. I'll be god damned! Ain't she a mess? Then she say, "name your salary." I see. And did you? Did I what? Name your salary. Now, what you think I am? I ain't startin' working for no trashy something like her. But she got you to thinking... Didn't she? You might could say that. Name your salary? "Name... your salary." That's what she say. Well... how does $65 a week sound? Sounds pretty good. $75 sound better. So it does. Beginning this week. That's mighty nice of you, Mr. Werthan. I--i appreciate that. Oh... Mr. Werthan? Uh-huh? You ever had people fighting over you? No. Well, I tell you, it feel good. H-Hello? Mama! Oh, thank goodness. I was afraid your phone would be out. No, but i-- I don't have any power. No, nobody does. That's why I called. Well, I found some candles. And, you know, it re--it reminded me of gaslight on forsyth street. It seems like we had ice storms all the time back then. Ha ha! I can't come after you because my driveway is a sheet of ice. I--I'm sure yours is, too. Yeah, well, I'm fine, Boolie. I imagine they're working on the lines now. I'll go listen to my car radio and call you back. Don't go anywhere. Oh--oh, really? I--i was hoping to have a jog around the neighborhood. You're a doodle, mama. Love to florine. That's the biggest lie I will tell all day. Who is it? Oh! Hoke... Good morning, miss Daisy. What in the world? Oh, my god. Oh. I learn to drive on ice when I deliver milk for avondale dairy. Ain't much to it. I slip around a little coming down briarcliff, but nothing happen. Other folks banging into each other like they in the funny papers, though. I stop at the 7-Eleven. I figure your stove out. And lord knows you've got to have your coffee in the morning. Oh, how sweet of you, hoke. Yeah. We ain't had good coffee round here since idella pass. Well, that's true. I mean, I can fix her biscuits and you can fry her chicken, but nobody could make idella's coffee. I wonder how she did it. I don't know'm. Every time the "hit parade" come on TV, it put me in mind of idella. Yes. Sittin' up in the chair, her daughter say, spry as the flowers in springtime. Watching the "hit parade" like she'd done every Saturday the lord sent. And then during the "lucky strike extra," all of a sudden, she belch and she gone. Idella was lucky. Yes'm... 'Spec she was. Mmm. Where you going? Put these there things up and take off my overshoes. Well, i--i didn't think you'd come today. What you mean? It ain't my day off, is it? I don't know what you're gonna do around here, except keep me company. I was thinking I light us a fire. Mmm, mmm. Oh, eat anything you want out of the icebox 'cause they're all gonna spoil anyway. Yes'm. Oh, and, uh, you can wipe up what you tracked on my kitchen floor. Now, miss Daisy, what you think I am, a mess? Yes, that's exactly what I think you are. All right, then. All right, all right, all right. All right. Oh, get on. H--hello? It'll all be melted by this afternoon. They said so on the radio. I'll be out after you as soon as I can get down the driveway. Well, stay where you are, Boolie. Hoke is here with me. How in the hell did he manage that? Oh, he's very handy. I'm fine. I don't need a thing in the world. Hello? Have I got the right number? I never heard you say loving things about hoke before. I didn't say I love him. I said he was handy! Uh-huh. Oh, honestly. Are you trying to upset me and irritate me in the middle of an ice storm? Well, what is it? What, what-- what in the world took you so long? Couldn't help it. Big mess up yonder. Well, well, what is it? I mean, I might as well not go to the temple at all now. You can't go to temple today, miss Daisy. Well, why not? I mean, what in the world is the matter with you? Somebody done bomb the temple. What?! Bomb the temple? Yes'm. That's why we stuck here so long. Oh, I can't believe it. That's what the policeman tell me up yonder. He say it happen about a half-hour ago. Oh, my god! Well, was anybody there? I mean, were people hurt? He didn't say. Well, who would do that? You know as good as me. Always be the same ones. Well, it's a mistake. I'm sure they meant to bomb the conservative synagogue or--or the orthodox one. I mean, everybody knows that the temple is reform. Everybody knows that. It don't matter to them people. A Jew is a Jew to them folks. Just like light or dark, we're all the same--niggers. Oh, I can't believe it, honest to god. Well, I know just how you feel, miss Daisy. Back down there above macon on the farm, I about ten, eleven years old, and one day my friend Porter, his daddy hanging from a tree. And the day before, he laughing and pitching horseshoes with us and talking about Porter and me gonna have strong, good right arms like him. And then he hanging up yonder with his hands tied behind his back and the flies all over him. And I seen that with my own eyes, and I throw up right where I standing. So, you go on and cry. I'm not crying. Yes'm. The idea. Why did you tell me that? I don't know. It just seemed like this here mess put me in mind of it. Oh, but that's ridiculous. I mean, the temple's got nothing to do with that. So you say. Well, we--we don't even know what happened. How do you know that that policeman was telling the truth? Now, why would that policeman go and lie about a thing like that? Well, you never get anything right. Miss Daisy! Somebody done bomb that place and you know it. Oh, go on, go on. I don't want to hear any more about it. I see if I can get us out of here and take you home. You'll feel better-- I don't feel bad! You're the boss. Oh, stop talking to me. Thank you, red. And--and thank you all. I... I am deeply grateful to be chosen man of the year by the Atlanta business council. An--an honor I have seen bestowed on some mighty fine fellas, and which i--i certainly never expected to come to me. I--I'm afraid the loss here and the gain here have given me an air of competence I don't possess. I tell you, I... I sure wish my father... And my grandfather could see this. 72 years ago, they opened a--a little hole-in-the-wall shop on whitehall street with one printing press. They managed to grow with Atlanta, and to this day the Werthan company believe we want what Atlanta wants. This award proves we might be right! Thank you. Oh, oh, oh! One more thing. If the jackets whup the dogs up in Athens Saturday afternoon, I'll be a completely happy man. Ha ha ha! HELLO? OH. Oh, hi there, miss McClatchey! Ha ha ha! You always recognize my voice. Uh-huh. Ha ha! What a shame a wonderful girl like you never married. Ooh, I see. Uh-huh. Miss McClatchey, is my son in? Oh, oh, no. Don't pull him out of a sales meeting. Just--just give him a message for me. Tell him that I bought the seats for the uja banquet. Yeah, that's right, the uja banquet Honoring Martin Luther King on the 17th. oh, well, well, aren't you sweet to say so. Uh-huh. Ha ha! Well, now, listen, don't you worry. My cousin tillie in chattanooga married for the first time at 57. Uh-huh. Ha ha! There you go! Bye. Ha ha. Mama, how do you feel? Well, not a good question asking somebody nearly 90. Well, you look fine. Well, it's my ageless appeal. UH, MISS McClatchey GAVE ME YOUR MESSAGE About the banquet. Yeah, florine is invited, too. Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I thought hoke could drive us 'cause we're gonna be a crowd. Mama... We have to talk about this. Yeah. Talk about what? The feasibility of all this. Well, all right. You drive. I was just trying to be helpful. You know, I believe Martin Luther King has done some mighty fine things. Boolie, if you don't want to go to this dinner, why don't you come right out and say so? I want to go. You know how I feel about him. Of course, but florine-- florine has nothing to do with it! I still have to conduct business in this town! And the Werthan company will go out of business if you attend the king dinner? Not exactly, but a lot of the men I do business with wouldn't like it. They wouldn't come right out and say so. They'd just snicker and call me... "Martin Luther Werthan" behind my back, something like that. And I'd begin to notice my banking business wasn't being handled by the top dogs. Maybe I'd start to miss out on a few special favors, a few tips. I wouldn't hear about certain lunch meetings at the commerce club, little things you can't quite put your finger on. And Jack Raphael over at ideal press, he's a New York Jew-- instead of a Georgia Jew. And as long as you've got to deal with Jews, the really smart ones come from New York, don't they? So some of the boys might start throwing business to Jack instead of old Martin Luther Werthan. I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't happen, but that's the way it works. If we don't use these seats, somebody else will, and--and the good Dr. King will never know the difference, will he? S-So if we don't use these seats, I'm not supposed to go either? Mama! You can do whatever you want. Oh, thanks for your permission can I ask you something? When did you get so riled up about Martin Luther King? Time was I'd have heard a different story. Why, Boolie, I've never been prejudiced, and you know it! Ok, why don't you ask hoke to go to the dinner with you? Hoke? Oh, don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go. Ask him and see. I don't know why you still drive. You can't see. Yes'm, I can. You didn't see that mailbox. How you know what I didn't see? Almost poked a hole through my window! I mean, this car's all scratched up. Ain't no such-a thing. Well, how would you know? You can't see. I mean, what a shame-- brand-new car. You got this car two years come march. Oh... Oh, oh, you missed the turn. Ain't this dinner at the biltmo'? You know it is. Well, biltmo' straight this-a way. Oh, you know so much. Yes'm, I do. Ah, look, I've lived in Atlanta all my life. And ain't run a car in 20 years. Boolie said the silliest thing the other day. Is that right? Oh. Well, he's too old to be so foolish. Yes'm? What did he say? Oh, he--he was t--talking about Martin Luther King. You know him, I suppose? Martin Luther King? No'm. Oh. Oh, i--i was sure you did. Uh, but you--but you've heard him preach? Same way as you-- over the TV. Uh-huh. I think he's wonderful. Yes'm. You know, you could go over there and--and see him in person any time you wanted. Over there at the, um-- ebenezer? The ebenezer baptist church. Now, any sunday, and there he'll be. What you getting at, miss Daisy? Well, it... It's so silly. Boo--Boolie said that you wanted to go to this dinner with me tonight. Did you tell him that? No'm, I didn't. No, i--i didn't think you did. I mean, what would be the point? You ca--you can go over there any time you want. You know, whenever you want. You want the front door or the side door to the biltmore? I--i think the side door. Isn't it wonderful how things are changing? What you think I am? Hmm? Miss Daisy? What do you mean? You--you think I just some something, sitting up here, don't know nothing 'bout how to do? I--i don't know what you're talking about. Invitation to this here dinner? Come in the mail a month ago. Now, did be you want me to go with you, how come you wait till we in the car on the way to ask me? Well, well--all--all I said was that Boolie said you wanted to go. Oh, no. No. You're welcome to come, hoke. Uh-huh. Oh, my stars. Aren't you the great big baby. Never mind baby, next time you ask me some place, ask me regular. Oh, well you--you don't have to carry on so. That's all. Let's drop it. Oh, honestly. I'll help you to the door. Uh, thank you, hoke. I--i can help myself. Things changing? They ain't change all that much. Keep this movement going. Keep this movement rolling. In spite of the difficulties, and we're gonna have a few more difficulties. Keep climbing, keep moving. If you can't fly, run. If you can't run, walk. If you can't walk, crawl, but by all means, keep moving. ♪ We are not afraid ♪ today ♪ ay-ay ♪ oh, deep ♪ in my heart ♪ I do believe ♪ oh ♪ we shall overcome ♪ some day... Hello, hoke. How are you? I'm tolerable, Mr. Werthan. What can I do for you this morning? It's your mama. What's the matter? She worked up. Why should today be different from any other day? No, sir, this ain't the same. Hoke? Yes'm? She thinks she's teaching school, and i'm-- I'm real worried about her. She ain't making sense. I'll be right there. Thank you, sir. Hoke? Hoke? Yes'm. Oh, where--where--where'd you put my papers? Ain't no papers, miss Daisy. But my papers--i had them all corrected last night. And I put 'em down front so that I wouldn't forget them on the way to school! What'd you do with them? You talking outta your head. The children will be so disappointed if I don't give them their papers back. Ah, 'cause i--i always give them back the next day. And that's why they like me. Why aren't you helping me? What you want me to do, miss Daisy? Give me the papers. I won't be mad with you if you moved them, but I've got to get to school now 'cause I'll be late. And who will be there to take care of my class? They'll be all alone. Oh, god, oh, god! Sit--sit down. I do everything wrong. You're about to fall and hurt yourself. Come, come on, now. Miss Daisy... No, no. It doesn't matter. Ain't nothing awful except the way you carrying on. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Oh, god. Oh, god. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Ain't no papers, please. Please, ma'am. No papers. Please... Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. What difference does it make? The children are waiting, and I don't have the papers. No, they ain't! You ain't no teacher no more! Miss Daisy, ain't nothing the matter with you. Your mind done took a turn this morning, that's all. Oh, go on. Just go on. Come on. Sit down. I don't want to hear about--i just want-- you'll snap right back if you just let yourself. Sit down. I can't, I can't! You're a lucky old woman, you know that? No, I'm not. No, it's a mess and I can't do anything about it. You're rich and--and you're-- you're well for your time. And you got people care about what happens to you. No, no, no, no, no, no. You want something to cry about, I'll take you to the state home and show you what laying out there in the halls. I bet none of them take on bad as you're doing. No, no, because I got to go back to those children. They're waiting for me and they're-- no, no, no children. Those sweet children. Now, you keep that up, I promise, Mr. Werthan call the doctor on you. Just sure as you're born, that doctor gonna have you in the insane asylum before you know what hit you. That the way you want it to be? Is that the way... You want it to be? H--hoke? You--you still got that oldsmobile? From when I first come here? Oh, go on, miss Daisy. That thing been in the junkyard 15 years or more. I driving your next-to-last car now. '63 Cadillac running fine as wine. Oh, you ought not to be driving anything the way you see. Well, how--how you know the way I see unless you looking out of my eyes? Hoke? Yes'm? You're my best friend. Come on, now, miss Daisy. You just-- no. R--really, you are. You are. Hoke. You didn't drive yourself out here? Oh, no, sir. I don't drive now. My granddaughter run me out. My lord, is she old enough to drive? Michelle--37! She--she teach biology at--at Spelman College. I never knew that. Yes, sir. Huh. I've, uh... Taken most of what I want out of the house. Is there anything you'd like before the goodwill comes? My--my place is full to bursting now. It feels funny to sell the house while mama's still alive. I--i agree. But she hasn't even been inside the door for two years. I know I'm doing the right thing. Don't get me into it. I'm not gonna say anything to her about it. You right there. By the way, hoke, your check is going to keep coming every week, as long as you're there to get it. Huh? I appreciate that, Mr. Werthan. You can rest easy about it. Thank you, sir. I don't suppose you get out to see mama very much. It hard not driving, and--and that place ain't on no bus line. I--i goes in a taxicab sometime. Oh, I'm sure she appreciates it. Well, s--some days she better than others. Who ain't? We better get on out there. Get on out there. Oh, here. Thank you, sir. I guess you have a turkey dinner to get to, and, oh, so do I. Oh, why don't we call your granddaughter, tell her I'll run you home after. Thank you, sir. Well... Better get a move on. Happy Thanksgiving, mama. Look who I brought. Good morning, miss Daisy. You keeping yourself busy? She certainly is. Why, she goes to jewelry making. How many times a week is it, mama? Oh, she makes all kinds of things. Pins and--and-- and bracelets. And... She's a regular Tiffany's. Well, ain't that something. Oh, hoke! You know-- I thought of you the other morning on the expressway. I saw an avondale milk truck. You don't say! Oh! A big monster of a thing. It must have had 16 wheels. I wonder how you'd have liked driving that around? Hoke came to see me, not you. This one of her good days. Florine says to wish you a happy Thanksgiving, mama. She's in Washington, you know. You remember, mama, she's a republican national committee woman now. Good god. Boolie? What is it, mama? Uh, go charm the nurses. She wants you all to herself. You're a doodle, mama. Boolie still paying you? Every week. How much? That between me and him, miss Daisy. A highway robbery. How are you? Doing the best I can. Me, too. Well... That's all there is to it, then. Yep. Looka here! You ain't eat your Thanksgiving pie. Let me help you with that. Hmm?
