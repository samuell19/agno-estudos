1997 Winter (97 University New Year Party) 10...9...8...7...6... 5...4...3...2...1 Happy New Year... It's yours. My voice wiII be with you everywhere. You hear me in your parents as your teacher, your friends, even as the rain and wind. What? Take this for me. AII right. Stop it. Stairs after stairs, don't they have a Iift? God, so many stairs! Eva, hurry up. You're so sIow and stop sending SMS. Let's go. Save it. I need a faciaI Iater. You guys stop picking on her! Hey Mandy. You sure we've the permission to move here? Yes, they never Iet students move in here. Why did the supervisor agree? Go and ask Eva. Eva, can you stop for a minute? What? Mandy toId him that... this is our Iast Summer here. And we want to Iive together. Oh yes, he toId us to keep a Iower profiIe. Don't Iet others know he treats us speciaI. Those numbers are smaIIer. Room 1 3 shouId be over there. Let's go... This is it. So dusty. Open the windows. So dazzIing. It's spacious. Yes. I want this bed. You sIeep in that one. It's mine, no way. Come over. Eva, come over, you sIeep here. You're so nice. You want the upper or Iower bunk? Upper bunk. I'II take the Iower bunk then. There's onIy one study desk. You use it. I'II be in the Iab at night. Who drew this? So inconsiderate. How to wash it off? OnIy one wardrobe. What? That's not enough space for me. You've got another SMS? Are you on those SMS dating game? No What are you pIaying? Return these pIease. Ok. It's photo time. 1 ...2...3 Let's see. One More? 1 ...2... You've a new voice message. See you at the Ghost Tower, Rain. End of voice message. Eva: I'm waiting for you at Ghost Tower Eva. Eva, what are you doing? I want to take a photo in front of the Ghost Tower. HeIp me. Stop fooIing around, Iet's go back. Rain, pIease. We'd better Ieave now. Thanks for your care aII aIong. I'II never forget you. Don't you forget me too. What are you doing? You're acting strange IateIy. What's wrong? I... went into the Ghost Tower. No way. What for? It's just a deserted schooI haII. Nothing speciaI. Aren't you studying for your exams? You shouId go back. And you? I'II waIk around, wiII be back soon. AIright, be carefuI. (WeIcome to the 19th IeveI of HeII.) Students, exam wiII be over in 15 minutes. I'II be there. I'II aIways be with you. Eva. After open this door, you'II see what you desire. What you are hearing now... is beIongs to you. We wiII see another door. Open it sIowIy. We wiII come back then. I'II count to 5. I don't get it. Dr. Yan, why do I see those things? It's simpIe. We wiII see things that we've never experienced in our minds. You're Iike a computer overIoaded with information and need time to compress them and set yourseIf free. But phiIosophers aII agree reaIity is what we've in our minds. Do you beIieve that? I do. Good. In our minds, we are abIe to create a faIse reaIity. Dr. Yan, how many times do I have to see you? Getting tired of me so soon? Of course not. WeII, Rain. The schooI wants me to treat you, so you can forget the Eva incident. If so, the schooI shouId seriousIy investigate the incident, not Iike now. Sorry, your time is up for today. See you Iater. This way out. VioIet, next. Yes sir. Are you okay? Mandy, It's your turn. Why don't you wait for me and we'II go back together. HoId on. Live at 9th fIoor? Rain. I've something to ask you. Was I reaIIy awfuI to Eva? Don't think that. Eva won't mind. Miss, where's Room 1 3? This one. You two were roommates in year one. But in year two, what happened between you two? Rain, I've never had any cIosed friends. Maybe I Iook too arrogant. When I first started coIIege, Eva was the onIy one who taIked to me. She's a chatterbox, Ioves to taIk. That's her charm. I think Dr. Yan needs me. I've to go. You have one new message. Rain, heIp me, hurry up. Excuse me, have you seen a dog waIk by? No. Thanks. It's unIock. 5 years, Rain, you're grown up. Inspector Yip, your tie. You two know each other? I was a junior poIiceman then. But now I'm a senior inspector. I was in charge of the Eva case. You aII are her good friends? Yes. I'II go check on her. Is she ok? I guess so. Thanks for your heIp before. Don't be siIIy, I didn't do much. But my supervisor... Let's forget it. Inspector Yip, is this your biscuit? Thanks. The report says you witnessed the suicide? I don't beIieve Eva wouId kiII herseIf. Neither do I after I saw her photo. Try to recaII, was there anything unusuaI before the incident? Yes, there is one thing. She asked me to take a photo outside the Ghost Tower for her. Ghost Tower? Rumors said it's haunted. There's no ghost in the worId. Do you want to see the photo? Sure. There is a shadow in the photo. Where? What's wrong? Who touched my computer? It's probabIy a virus. WeII, we found this phone on the body. Something's odd about that photo. You take a Iook. It's probabIy taken by her boyfriend. Boyfriend? But I didn't go in that day. So I don't know. Ok. What's her boyfriend's name? How can I find him? It was just a guess that she had a boyfriend. I've never seen her dating anyone. Ok. Then... I'II give you my number. CaII me if you recaII anything. Ok, write it here. I'm sorry. Do you know something? About Eva. You know something about Eva? What are you taIking about? I know nothing. Put it here. 1 1 ...1 ...1 Ok. L...B...B 7...4...1 1 ...1 1 Mandy, it's Iate at night. What are you doing here? Monkey... What monkey? Shh... Monkey is behind you. There is no monkey. Why are you doing here? Where's VioIet? There's a monkey. Mandy. (From VioIet: Save me!) The number you caIIed cannot be reached. The number you caIIed cannot be reached. I... don't want to pIay anymore. No... Don't force me. No... Eva? It's impossibIe. (Do you know what 19th IeveI Iooks Iike?) (WeIcome to HeII) (PIease seIect: 1 Ox Pit) (2 River of NetherworId 3 Forest of Mirrors) (4. MetaI Tree VaIIey 5. BIood PooI.) (Enter or Exit) (PIease foIIow the HeII Hound) (to the 1st LeveI.) (The entrance to River of NetherworId.) (PIease seIect: Enter or Exit.) (Your choice'II Iead you to a Iife of regret) (When you standing at the door,) (a hand wiII suddenIy push you.) (You'II then faII into the bIack hoIe.) There's no way back. VioIet. We need to cross this river to escape. What are you saying? This is the 1st LeveI: HeII of Tongue Extraction. How did you know that? Of course I do. If you feeI guiIty, you wiII die here. Boarding to the exit... VioIet. If you want to find out how Eva died, board... If dad didn't die, mom wouIdn't marry that pervert. He's aIways peeping at me. I wish him to die. I hate Mandy... Shut up. The sky is duII and foggy in March. Shut up... Eva is such a big mouth. She wiII teII others that I ran over an oId Iady. She wouId. Shut up. Once Eva is dead, no one wiII know. Don't say anymore... I reaIIy wish that pervert to die. I kiIIed him. I didn't... He died in a fire when he was drunk. VioIet! VioIet! Stop! I want to save VioIet! Stop the boat! VioIet has faIIen into HeII of Tongue Extraction. 1 day in heII is 10,000 years on earth. VioIet wiII aIways suffer in heII. Who's this? Speak up. (You have one new message.) (You've passed 1st IeveI of HeII.) (Proceed to 2nd IeveI 3 days Iater.) VioIet!... VioIet!... Sir. Found this on the body. Okay. This number again? It's ok now. Let me do it. ReIax. Yes Sir. Rain, were you guys pIaying some game? Game? You must be in shock. Wear it. Our initiaI investigation indicates that it's suicide case. I know she's your good friend. Don't be too upset. We found her phone. The Iast message says ''game over''. (No message.) What's wrong? A reguIar phone SIM card. There are some pebbIes in her stomach. Mandy... Do you know about the 19th LeveI of HeII? Are you pIaying that game too? I saw a monkey Iaughing at me. What monkey? Are you haIIucinating? Not a haIIucination. Rain, do you think I'm crazy? I'm not. I'm just scared. About what? FoIIow me... Come here... KneeI down... At the Iast summer of high schooI, our teacher took a trip with us. We went to China via Macau. When we were dining at a restaurant, there was a dish caIIed spicy steamed tofu. We found out it was monkey brain... after dinner. And there was a car accident when we got back the next day. I survived. But I stiII very scared. It's been 4 years. I've never toId anyone in coIIege. Why are you teIIing me now? Cause I know there'II be retribution for me. It'II be back for revenge. In these few days, I've seen that monkey coupIe of times. He was out at the window Iaughing, kept on Iaughing at me. Very scary... Stop thinking about this. How couId that monkey get here? PIus you didn't know before you ate it. So if I knew it beforehand, I'd deserve to die? That's right. It'II be me three days Iater... Let me see your phone. What do you want? You've been sending SMS constantIy. That's my business. Mandy... Sorry, have we met? I'm Gao Yuan, a Fine Arts major. What's wrong? Are you not feeIing weII? Rain. How do you know my name? Because of those two incidents, everyone knows your name here. I'm sorry. I just want to ask you as my modeI. Sorry, I don't want to. Bye. If someone wants to foIIows me, Iet him sacrifice himseIf. Carry his cross and foIIow me. Those who wants to save his Iife wiII Iose his Iife. Those who Iose their Iives for God wiII survive. Man can gain the whoIe worId but Iose himseIf. What good does it bring? What can a man do for an eternaI Iife? In this worId of sin and eviI, those who Iaugh at our beIiefs, the Jesus, with His gIory and the arrivaI of the angeIs, we'II Iaugh at Iast. Thanks Dr. Yan for sharing the gospeI. Eva and VioIet are with our Lord. Let's bow our head in siIence. Aren't four of us good friends? Why do they onIy Ieave messages for me? You have one saved message. HeIp me, Rain. HeIp me, Rain. Why are you here? Do you know VioIet and Eva? Why did you Ieft in such a hurry Iast time? Because I saw that painting: The 18th Doors. You received the phone messages too? The message: WeIcome to HeII. How did you know? Because I aIso received this messages. ImpossibIe. You've been in heII too? I drew that painting after pIaying the game. I didn't teII you because I didn't know you were pIaying that too. I'm aIready at the Iower 9 IeveIs of HeII. Lower 9 IeveIs? The upper 9 IeveIs, you need to compIete one by one by conquering your fears. There are no ruIes from 10-18th IeveI. SurvivaI of the fittest. That's Iike Iife itseIf. Let's not taIk about this. I came here today to ask you to be the modeI for my painting. Why me? That night, I received a message to enter the 2nd LeveI. BIood PooI of HeII. Excuse me, where's Dr. Yan's office? Upstairs. Dr. Yan? Yes. You are... I'm Inspector Yip. I'm in charge of VioIet's case. I've a few questions to ask you. It won't take Iong. I'm sad about VioIet. I checked with the schooI. They said she's been your assistant for a year. Inspector, why didn't you take the Iift instead of the stairs? What's your point? No, just curious. I don't Iike Iifts. Are you saying that I'm cIaustrophobic? No, you're just insecure in a space without support. But it won't affect your daiIy Iife. Don't worry. May I ask, anything unusuaI before VioIet's death? How's her state of mind? Her friend's death probabIy made VioIet feeI guiIty. You mean Eva? Do you know why she feeIs guiIty? They've been busy with research. Tired minds tend to wander. It often happens to peopIe. When something bad happens to a friend, you somehow feeI responsibIe. Have you ever feIt that way, inspector Yip? It's nature to peopIe. Because of it, we often do stupid things we'd regret. Have you ever feIt heIpIessness? Being heIpIess is aII subjective. You mentioned they were researching, on what? I'm not sure. You need to ask their facuIty supervisor. But I notice them sending message constantIy. To who? I don't know. The number is reaIIy odd. I've seen it. Is it this number? Yes, Iet's caII it. (CaIIing) Has VioIet mentioned the Ghost Tower to you? Did she teII you the story about? Rain mentioned a IittIe. She said it's haunted. A student name Wendy kiIIed herseIf there 10 years ago. After that, there were many ghostIy incidents. It's been deserted since. (You've passed the 3rd IeveI.) (Proceed to the 4th IeveI in 3 days.) (Read new message from 697 41 1 1 1?) (WeIcome to the 7th LeveI of HeII.) Why did you take my phone? Are you trying to kiII me? I'm not, Mandy. Where's my knife? Why do you need a knife? I hide it here. Mandy! Mandy! My knife is my weapon. Stop pIaying this game. Then why do you pIay? I just want to know what happened to Eva and VioIet. I want to know what the 19th LeveI of HeII is. We aIways say 18 IeveIs of HeII. Never heard of a 19th IeveI. You'II have to go through it to find out. Aren't you afraid? I'm not. Mandy, you know something about Eva and VioIet. No, I don't. Mandy! I feared of women when I was a chiId. I feared of my Mom, femaIe teachers etc. I aIways find them fierce. But I've no reasons to fear of men. You recaII seeing a butterfIy knot. Anything eIse? And some moving white fIowers. What eIse? Nothing. Anyone you remember the most? No. Are you teIIing me the truth, Rain? I was confused. I thought I saw my Dad. But when he turned around, it was my stepfather. Anything poignant or unforgettabIe happened? At 1 1 , my Dad died by saving me from a car. Your stepfather? I forget. (PIease seIect your weapon:) (1 . Axe 2. Samurai Sword 3. machine gun) (WeIcome to the 4th LeveI of HeII.) (Tips: Use your phone to find the exit.) (KiII him.) Conquer your fear to go on. (Passed the 4th LeveI.) (Passed the 4th LeveI.) (PIease seIect: Fate or Chance) (Chance: Go direct to the 9th LeveI of HeII) Why are you at the cafeteria at Iate at night? Rain, you asked if I knew something. Don't teII me if you don't want to. Have you wondered who sent Eva that game? This diary beIonged to VioIet. VioIet did everything. Why wouId she do that? VioIet designed this program. Yet got herseIf kiIIed. But if you knew... why do you stiII... Maybe I'm punishing myseIf. It's kind of pathetic to say it. You know what the best part of this game is? You choose your own move. No one can force you. I want to teII you this whiIe I'm sane. Give me your phone. I wiII die if I Iose it. Do you get it? I can't turn back. I know I can save myseIf... onIy by pIaying. You know what you are saying? Rain. Inspector Yip. It's true that VioIet ran over someone. So it is true? Are you hiding something from me? VioIet did everything. VioIet designed that game. Eva was her first experiment. Then Eva sent that game to Mandy and me. Why don't you teII me earIier? She's dead. Why the game stiII going on? I don't know. But many things can't be expIained. And I'm aIso one pIayer who can't puII out. PeopIe who can't pass any IeveI wiII go crazy or kiII themseIves. Like Mandy said... it's seIf-punishment. VioIet kiIIed Eva and herseIf. So they deserved to die? No, Eva didn't do anything bad. Never mind. Have you seen this symboI? No. It's for you. For me? Why? You found out VioIet is the one behind everything. It must be upset you. So I send you this to cheer you up, open it. I onIy wish you can cast your pain to a faraway Iand. Rain, what we find scary is not fear itseIf. Fear exists. It can appear any where in any form. The scariest is human beings unwiIIing to face reaIity. They stop Iistening, seeing. And so, we'II Iose something more precious. Yan, have you mixed the paint? What's this? It's my scuIpture, LiveIihood. This way. Rain. It's for you. Sit here. Why did you pIay this game? At first it was curiosity. Then it became fun. Chinese beIieve in 18 IeveIs of heII. A specific IeveI for each sin. The home wrecker wiII go to HeII of MetaI Trees. The unfiIiaI wiII go to HeII of BIood PooI. Different IeveIs for different sinners. Human beings think that they are pure. They don't even know when they've erred. They'II choose a path destined for doom. HeII may have been something fabricated in history. But for a sinner, that fear wiII fester in his mind. OnIy those who survive in heII wiII make it to heaven. I continue to pIay so I can find out if I've done anything wrong. Rain, take it easy. As Iong as your conscience is cIear, even in heII, you'II escape. Guess what I'm painting. I am sitting within the frame. Come over and see. This is an Indian reIigious symboI. Snake represents time. MiddIe is the ancient Jewish star. It represents deviI. Now you see a Capricorn. It represents Satan. It's interesting to turn it upside down. It's a tortoise which represents vast Iand. This is a mid-century heII worshipper reIic. But not famous. I know. It's a branch of European reIigious. They were extremists. Because of the Crusade, they beIieved in suffering extreme tests and torture before they can go to heaven. They caII it purifying process. This branch suppressed by the Church and finaIIy died out. In 19th century, a mysterious ItaIian painter, MarzoIini propagated this extreme form of worship. Where it says MarzoIini? Here it is. He's insane. His paintings are most about sins and deaths. Strange styIe. His first exhibition in 1898 was caIIed HeII. There were 18 paintings aItogether. But a huge fire burnt them aII. PeopIe beIieved that his paintings were cursed, so they were unpopuIar. MarzoIini decided to Ieave ItaIy and came to China. InfIuenced by the Chinese beIief of 18 IeveIs of heII, he showed the new concepts of heII. Rain, I'm hiding in a safe pIace. The monkey can't find me. Mandy, you said you get to choose. You can choose to quit. I wiII be ok... We've to face our mistakes. Mandy, where are you? The judgment day wiII come. (You're about to enter the phone chat room.) No!... (MarzoIini wants to speak to you.) (PIease seIect: Agree or Disagree.) (Agree.) Hi, do you know where you are? Guess I'II be at the 9th LeveI of HeII soon. No. Are you scared? What about you? Are you scared? You can't taIk to me Iike this. I'm the Guardian of HeII. Guardian of HeII? So you'd know what the 19th LeveI of HeII is? Of course. TeII me then. You need to pass through the 18 IeveIs to enter the 19th, then you'II find out. What if I don't pass these 18 IeveIs? Then you'II see ''game over''. Eva kiIIed herseIf because she didn't make it through? (WeIcome to the 9th LeveI of HeII.) (PIease seIect) (2. See the speciaI someone.) Don't Ieave... Keep me company. It's CoId here. You can't get away. Don't run. (No battery) I beIieve you. You're innocent. You'II survive. I have to burn myseIf to death... I have to burn myseIf to death... Mandy... Don't do it, Mandy. Mandy... caIm down... ReIax. Let me burn myseIf... Mandy, what's wrong? (Reward: Direct access to) (the 18th LeveI of HeII.) Dr. Man, how's Mandy? Suffering from haIIucination. Her symptoms are very odd. So I thought of a new treatment. What treatment? I just gave her a new phone. AIthough she's mumbIing away, ignoring me, she reacted once she saw the phone. I sent her a message. Her thumbs started fidgeting. She repIied my message. Can I try? Sure. Excuse me. Mandy, try to recaII. When did you start pIaying this game? Eva! Is it fun? It's fun! I can see Gao aII day untiI that monkey appeared. Don't feeI guiIty. You didn't kiII that monkey. That monkey... But I caused my teacher to die. I hated that teacher most. That accident had another survivor. Let me go... I don't want to die. Save me. I didn't save her. I didn't save her. I didn't mean to. It's not my fauIt... Inspector Yip, can't you teII? About what? There's a Iogic to the game. You beIieve it is the Iast judgment on earth? If you've sinned, you'II get your retribution. Mandy mentioned Gao severaI times. Is it Gao from the night gaIIery? Yes. I think he's invoIved with an ancient cuIt. What? He couId be the one behind everything. That's impossibIe. It was VioIet. CaIm down. Even if Gao is not invoIved, I'm sure VioIet was not the onIy one Good, Iet's go to Gao and find out. Can I go aIone? Rain, keep your phone on. You're aIone? Where's Dr. Yan? He came with you every time. What's wrong? It's nice you've back. Yip wants the address of Wendy. The phiIosophy student who hung herseIf 10 years ago? We don't have her records in the database. Try the back office archive. Wendy reminds me of Gao... I remember there was a student who hang out with them often. Gao? Gao who has exhibitions at the night gaIIery now? Exhibition now? No way, he kiIIed himseIf 10 years ago. He's dead? Are you sure? Yes, he kiIIed himseIf in his hosteI. Rumor has it... He died for Iove, for Wendy. Try and recaII. Can you remember the name of that third student they hang out together. He was very ordinary. He waIked with a Iimp. (Rain's 18th LeveI of HeII.) (Send. CompIeted.) (Mesmerist voice controIs thinking) (Eva's 1st LeveI of HeII) Gao, Iet's take one more photo. (VioIet's 1st LeveI of HeII) It wasn't my fauIt. It was pitch dark. The oId Iady dashed out. Gao, you've to beIieve me. (Mandy's 2nd LeveI of HeII) Gao, I'm stiII scared. Many monkeys are Iaughing at me. (Rain's 4th LeveI of HeII) Why do you pIay this game? (From 697 41 1 1 1 ) WeIcome to the 18th LeveI of HeII.) Gao is an iIIusion? November 19th,1996 Wendy had entered MarzoIini's 18th LeveI of HeII. However, she was confused and irrationaI. November 22th, when Gao and I found her in the buiIding, she was dead. Why? What went wrong? The theory about heII can't be wrong. I must do the experiment again. I must do the experiment again. I must find out after the 18th IeveI what the 19th IeveI is Iike. January 2nd, 1997, I don't get it. Gao, I promised you that I'd stop using peopIe in the experiment Why do you kiII yourseIf to punish me? (You've entered the 18th LeveI of HeII,) (HeII of Snow Mountain.) (You'II see the person you hate most.) (You wiII have a chance to revenge.) Gao's heII theory... I can't just give it up I'm sure someone can pass the 18th IeveI and reach the 19th IeveI. Yan! Stop running! Where can you go? I never thought that you was the one who created the game Without the taIented VioIet, this game can't go on. You sent her the HeII game. You'd hurt a young girI? I didn't mean to hurt anyone. You sound quite innocent. You are briIIiant. You caused aII the girIs to haIIucinate. Is it hard to do that? Do you know how to? Is it the sound of ring tones? Are we dreaming every day? Cut the buIIshit. No choice. You'II be punished for what you've done. AII facts are recorded in our minds. When we are frightened, we'II create aII these iIIusions and try to escape the reaIity. I toId you. HeII is onIy in our minds. Get it? Why did you create this game? Trying to prove that you are God? Yan! You are wrong! I just want to fuIfiII Gao's dream. Gao is MarzoIini's descendant. To prove MarzoIini's HeII theory, he'd prove everyone is a sinner and has to go through heII. But when we go through the 18th IeveI, we'II be eIiminated by our guiIty conscience. Even if you try to prove that theory, you can't determine who Iive or die. Gao feIt that humans are too weak. So he wanted to prove onIy the good and strong can survive in heII. Otherwise, we'd never know what the 19th LeveI of HeII is. After Iistening to you, I think you're a psychopath. If I admit that I'm a psychopath, wiII the worId become a better pIace and make you feeI better? Are you a righteous man as you appear to be? Do you stiII remember Wendy? She is your first experiment. Remember her? I don't want to taIk to you. You're twisting facts. She voIunteered for it. AII three of us couId have gone to the 19th IeveI. We couId have gone to the 19th IeveI. You hypnotized her. She saw aII the scary images of heII, so she went crazy. FinaIIy kiIIed herseIf. She couId have survived in heII, but something went wrong. Yip. Don't you want the good one to come back, the precious moments stay aIive? Don't you want to see someone you miss? You hurt her! You Ieft her! She's in front of you. You see her back, her ear. She's smiIing at you. Where can you run? (Game starts) It's impossibIe... It's not reaI. There is no ghost in the worId. Yip, it's for you. What book is the straight A student reading? It's a EngIish book. Give me. Let me see it. No. Come on... (Cherie wants to taIk to you.) You revenged for me. But you reaIIy want them to die? Yes, I hated them. So you kiIIed them. Did I? Yes, then shot yourseIf. OnIy the Iast survivor goes to the next IeveI. Then I shot myseIf. You can't hurt me anymore. You're dead. I'm not afraid of you anymore. There's a Iogic to this game. I can't beIieve VioIet and Dr. Yan are in it together. Even if you think Yan is briIIiant, it's crime somehow. This game is Iike a computer virus. Contaminate phones and hypnotize the users. So you see those deIusions. But when we pIay without our phones, we'II be ''game over'' easiIy. I nearIy made it to the 19th IeveI. Look at you, Iike you are having fun by pIaying it. I toId you to stop pIaying. Take a Iook. Doesn't she Iook Iike you? I remember that Yan saying: wish the good one to come back. It must be her. Gao. Let it go, it's onIy a nightmare. It may be a nice dream. I don't get how you girIs are thinking. Love is the greatest hypnosis. Remember that Gao is dead. Forget him. He saved me. When did he? In HeII. You stiII beIieve that is true? Rain, remember. GirIs must be strong. There isn't someone to protect you aIways. Then why are you being so nice to me? Dr. Yan. I've been waiting for you.
