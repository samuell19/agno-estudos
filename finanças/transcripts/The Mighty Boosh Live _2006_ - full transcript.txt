There's another one here. Let's have a look at this one. It's just screaming, that one. Quite abstract... Yeah, well you know.. I get fan mail, alright? Yeah! It's not the quantity of the fan mail, it's the quality of the fan! -That's what I say. -It is what he says. It is! This came to me - this piece of fan mail - came to me this, only this very morn' and ... I'm bringing morn' back as a figure of speech. -This came to me this fair morn'. -Oooh this fair morn'. -This fair morn' has arrived. -Good luck with that. Check it out.

This is, you know, he's intellectual - man of letters all around... -Man made of letters? -Yeah, this is from him. -Really? That Irish guy on the late? -Yeah check it out. Dear Howard Moon, I just wanted to drop you a line, since I thought your performance in The Mighty Boosh was mesmerizing. Mere sincerely Tom Paulin. Tom Paulin! -Yeah, that came to me. To ME! -Yeah, that's good. What's this little bit here he's put? -Don't read that bit! -What is it? -Don't read it! Yes and could I possibly have a signed photograph of your cock and balls? Ooh Tom's a bit weird, isn't he? Creepy Tom... -Creepy Tom. -Creepy creepy Tom Tom. Anyway how have you been since the telly show? You've been alright? -I've been real good sir, real good. -Yeah? -Telly show? Are you ten? -Mentally, yeah. I've been good yeah, very busy - working on my theatre skills - training myself up for the, you know, this run. Working on the ancient art of mime. You know, so... check me out. Ow! Comin'at'ya'... yeah? I'm in a chimney. See that? What about this? Look! I'm next to a log... Chaffinch. -Do chaffinch again! -I only do that once. Yeah, I've been busy - you know - working myself up on the theatre department, you know what I mean? -Building up my theatre muscles... -So you've been busy? That's what you're sayin'? Weird that you should say that, 'cos I was walking through Camden the other day and I saw you in a skip, weeping... -That was an art piece, that I was... -Was it? - Yeah... Yeah but you had like a shirt and tie on, but no pants or trousers on. Yeah? Too much for you, was it? -That's what I do, you know, I'm a maverick. -It was too much. It was quite early in the morning. I was trying to eat a baguette. -That's what I do. -It was a shock. I take my work into the streets, you know? I don't just do stuff in theatres, this is like oldschool for me, you know? I'll go into the streets in my world - you can't put me in a box. If you put me in a box I'll break out of the box, you know? If you put a boundary around me, I'll eat the boundary and wash it down with a cup of hot steaming rules. Ow! comin'at'ya' like a beam, like a ray, like a buzzard! Swooping about, know what I mean? Peckin' at the boundaries. That's the way I work! That sounds electric. -Yeah? What have you been up to then? -Well, pretty much, right after the telly show I've invented this game - Brixton check this out, alright? I've invented a game called: Pelt The Rabbit In His Big White Face! Genius! I know, the title alone is pretty cool, but wait - til you hear what happens - you're in here, right, or wherever, by the windmill doesn't matter and this massive rabbit comes in, he's got really massive face, he's a freak, he's like that - and he's quite tall he's like six foot - and he comes running towards you and you've gotta like leg it and get away from him or like pelt him with coins or sunflower seeds or take your Chelsey boot off and just take him out. Cos if he catches you he just throws you on the floor and rapes you. That's not a game, is it? Really that... That's just a sequence of events. A sequence of horrific events. Culminating in a rape. -Where's the game elements? -Yeah, but it's not an ordinary rape! It's a rabbit rape! It's a terrific bunny-bumming! -From MB Games? What? There's no strategy! -Of course there's a strategy! Why? What is it? Well, you know, the thing with it is you never know when he's gonna come, do you? When he's gonna arrive, easy! He might come in an hour, he might come in two hours, he might come in month, he might come in a year, he might come in fourteen minutes! What if he's ill? He's got a brother looks exactly like him! He's the worse of the two if anything - he's more powerful and vigorous. You'll never get away from him. If it's his brother, you might as well just sit down.. ..put up the white flag. This isn't the show by the way:) This is just, you know little bit of idle banter up top. -The show's all back here, waiting to come out. -Oh yeah I can feel it.. There's a tiny bit of the show. I can feel it! Look at the show - it's lively tonight! Let's have a little glimpse of the show! -Did I dream that? -Let's see if it was real. -Yeah, we've got some stuff lined up for you. -It's different every night that bit. Yes I thought what we should do really before unleashing that is warm up a little bit. So you know, get ourselves into the theatre mode. -I've written a small piece of theatre.. -Yeah? -..which we could do right here, right now so.. -A small piece? -A pouch. -A pouch. -A pouch of theatre? -Yeah, powerful pouch. -And they do call you the theater wallaby? -Yes, they do. That's how I type. This is something I've created and I'd like to do it now - we're all gonna get warmed up -..you know if we didn't warm up.. -No way! You know, you could strain a theatre muscle or something so.. you know... You might fracture your eyes, sir. We don't want that. -So.. -What shall I do then? -Well you can be in it. -No way! -Yeah! -Really? -Can you act? -Can I act? Not really, no... That was me acting then, aaa. The Twisterroonie.. -No, still no! -Come on! -No, not even through your nice new Kiss jacket. Never touch me. -What shall I do then? -Get ready I'll introduce it. Yeah? Alright, cool, I'm going off like this - ooh monkey hands... ..and frozen legs. Monkey hands and frozen legs - the ultimate combination. Okay. Right, well this is little piece now, that I've written myself with a pen. And... it's set in Russia, turn of the century... I know what are you thinking. Don't think that, because.. this is dark penetrating theatre. Please enjoy a piece I've written, called simply: ''Pies''. This is fucking ridiculous! You're out of your mind! Would you like a pie? No... But it is a good pie. Nevertheless. Last time you gave me pie... ..I cut into it with my tiny pie cutter... ..and millions of birds flew out - hitting me in the eyes and the temples! I was confused - it was a trick pie! Why you no like my pie? I just told you. Eeee you don't like my pie-eee... Oooh tricky pie... Aiiiiii bring pie to show you I love you! Why can't you just tell me you love me? Pastry goods every fucking day with you! -You don't like pie? -Ooohhhhh pie... - Whyyoudon't liiiike.. -Idon'twantpie.. Arghghghghghg I don't want pie.. -Wantpie wantpie.. -Urghghghgh..! Thanks a lot! -Penetrating theatre... Thank you! -I like this hat. It's quite cool. -It's good. -In the kind of Pete Doherty way. Ooh I can't find my band! Mate, your're the frontman - they're behind'ya. Oh yeah, cheers! -What's that? -He plays Give us a clue. -Oh yeah, he's quite good at that isn't he. -He's really good at it, actually. Yeah, he's a dab hand. So.. right, well it's time to move on now, to phase two point nine of the evening. Which is my favourite. It's the part where we introduce you to the guests - to people you're gonna be meeting in the show. -We've got some great people. -Oh who have we got? We've got Daley Thompson. He's gonna come down, he's gonna saw a calculator in half.. ..to see where the numbers live! Oh yeah.. And he's gonna shave his moustache off.. ..to reveal a tattoo of a moustache. -So he's quite.. -Daley. -Daley. So before that - we didn't wanna peak too soon - we're gonna have a guest now a great guy.. a man who.. a great friend of mine, a great friend of yours, erm, not a friend of yours.. ..sadly - he hates you. But.. Dunno why you chose to sit so close to the front really, cos.. you know what I mean? It's a bit weird considering everything that has happend between you and the hatred.. ..that has being brewing. But that aside, please welcome to the stage - Naboo the enigma! Look at him, he's like a puma in a turban. Look at that - what's going on that mind? Nobody knows? He could be wrestling with the dilemmas of time itself, solving the riddles of the universe.. Deep stuff. Let's have a listen. I might have a pot noodle later. Chicken and mushroom. Naboo the enigma! Powerful stuff. What are YOU doing here? I warned you, gonna have to turn my back on you!

Well it is quite a while ago, you know, but these things they take time. Yeah.. You get out of the house much these days Bollo? Or you...

Huh? -Heey where are you from? -I think he liked me. -Yeah. I bet he loved you! I just think he hasn't make his mind up yet, you know? -That'd be it, yeah. -That he's taking his time. -But I think he's keeping an eye on me. -Oh yeah. And I'm not overly sure, but I think Peter might be in tonight. -Really? -Sitting up to back, yeah. I'm pretty sure I saw him in the bar earlier eating a flapjack. He does like flapjacks. Do you mind if I... do a bit of funny business for Peter? Funny business? Well, you know, the audition it was quite serious, I'd like to show Peter Bollo's funny side. Maybe do a bit of stand-up? -Yeah. -Okay. -Is that okay? -Yeah. -I'll get a mic. -Okay I'll go over there, you can introduce me. -Yeah, I'll bring you on, make it all professional, yeah? Okay, cool. It's quite exciting. Does Naboo know you are here? He's been dealt with. Look at all these seats, he had to sit right there at the front. What a dick. Okay.. So, Bollo have you ever done stand-up before? No. Are you feeling confident? No. Okay, ladies and gentlemen you're in for a treat tonight, mate he's got some tight one liners, he's a little bit saucy in places, don't let that put you off. Here he is - Bollo the stand-up! I was.. I was in the supermarket the other day and I had a shopping trolley... And I was pushing it along and it had a wonky wheel. And I pushed it along a bit.. and it went a bit to the left.. ..and so I pushed it a bit further and it went a bit further to the left. And I pushed it a little bit further still and it went even further to the left. And in the end I kind of ended up back where I was in the first place. Eh.. um... here's another one. Very funny thing happened to me on the way here tonight. Yes, it did! There was a man, come up to me and he said: Bollo! He said... Oh hang on, was it a man? Sorry I mucked it up. I think it might have been a lady.. Let me start again - basically just passed and come up to me and they said: Bollo! -What's this? Naboo!

Why are you late for work this morn'? Was I late for work? This mooorn'? -This fair morn'. -This fair morn'. Well I tell you why, basically, what happened, right, I was in bed last night, it was really weird and I was all tucked up in my duvet, it was really nice, so I was just nodding off, yeah, when this kingfisher came in - he was massive, his body was about that wide yeah? But he had men's legs, sort of.. he was walking like that. And he had a kingf- and a really long beak and he just knelt on me, right, and just pecked me like that - really tiny pecks right in bridge of the nose, oh it was.. all night, I couldn't sleep. Okay, fair enough. I know why you were late for work this morning, I know why. Cos when I got up you were looking in the mirror, yeah? And when I left the house you were still looking in the mirror. And you had a mirrorball suit on, yeah? And you were trapped in your own reflection, you know? You're like a budgie. I'm not like a budgie! I mean why can't you just take a leaf out of my wardrobe, huh? -See what I do, when I get up? -What's going on there? This is what I do - I get up of a morn', slip into some nice slinky trews, pop on a nice muted shirt, strap on a couple of radio mics and I'm away. Why does it take you so long to get ready of a god damn cotton-picking morn'? Well this morning - the reason it took so long is cos I was waiting for this, and it came this morning, I've been waiting for it for six weeks, yeah? -What is it? -Check it out. It's a new hair drier! It's a new Jean-Claude Jacquettie hair drier. Do you know Jean-Claude Jacquettie, the French designer? Yeah, a few people know him, he's genius! Have you seen the advert?

Don't blow dry your own brains out. Gonna have to put a call in to Wella and smooth it over. Anyway, look, answer me' this question, yeah? Why do I have to open up shop every day? Why do I have to do that? Why me? Cos you're the only one who's trained-in mime. That is true actually. -Cuppa tea? -Yeah, alright. -Sugar? -I'll have two. Nice. Careful, that's piping hot. Oooh, sweep up the shards, sweep up the shards. -Watch your eyes. -Actually forget it. -What? -There's a customer, there's a cu.. Assume the position. The other one! I am doctor Henry Jay Sexually Frustrated Puppet-Fucker. Yes, that's my name. I believe it's German. World reknowned archeologist. I love archeology, it makes me feel like a topless puppy. -Good day, sirs. -Hello. I'm looking for Naboo. -Yeah, can you get out of my light? -Very well sir. You are the light. Naboo isn't here at the moment, he's out buying rugs in Quebec.. But I'm here so I am fully qualified to look at this sort of archeological stuff so I could have a... -..look at it.. -No no no no! Do not open the box! Only Naboo shall open the box. No one knows what's inside. It could be priceless jewels or unimaginable evil. -Oh look! Wiglets! -Yeah! How cool are they? They're made from my old hair, do you like those? They are amazing. Do you like those? If you like those, you might be interested in these. These are some very rare jazz LPs, I picked up on the continent, this one is Freddie Hubbard - live at the Black hawk now. Freddie was one of the foremost bebop trumpeters of his generation, in fact it's more postbop really, rather than bebop, but he was incredible, incredible trumpet player. Um... Take that as a NO. -Anyway, wiglets! -Yeah, how cool are they, yeah? Not only do they make you look stylish, but when you put them on they transform you into a popstar! I've always wanted to be a popstar! Pop one on! ~ Digging up bones with a plastic spade finding ruins from another age ~ ~ I'm Archeology boy.. ...I'm Archeology girl. ~ I'll take three! -That'd be seven hundred thousand euros, please. -Very well. Oh, one note, cheeky! Well, I'm off to be a popstar. -I thought you were an archeologist. -FUCK ARCHEOLOGY! -Good day sirs. -Yeah.. -Mate, you forgot yout box. -I said good day, sirs! ~ Digging up bones with a plastic spade... ~ Well, that's some of the strangest acting I've ever seen in my life.. Well he's left his box though, which is a bit of a turn-up so I suggest I make sure Naboo gets this here box. You can take the day off, if you fancy, get your hair done or whatever is it you need to get done and I make sure Naboo gets this box. -Okay, cool, excelent! -How about that? Um.. You heard what he said though? You're not gonna open it, are you? Oh, no no I would never do that. On the contrary! As soon as he is gone I shall open the box and all of it's content shall be mine! I'll better stay here then.. No, I'm not gonna open it - I just said I'm not gonna open it, yeah? -What? You just said you were! -Yeah in my mind, in my head! In my internal monologue. -Yeah? -I could hear it though. -Yeah, it's technique - it's theatrical technique! -A technique? You had a red light on your face! If anything, it was drawing attention to what you were saying. -Alright! -It's rubbish! Oh look, there's a sale on at Topshop! There isn't a sale on at Topshop at all. There is a sale on at Topshop, there's a sale on at Topshop! Oh.. bit of disappointment.. Heyho.. I'm gonna nip down the basement, do a bit of a stock check.. ~ Trapped in a box by a cockney nutjob, have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea ~ ~ I'm the hitcher, let me put you in the picture creeping in your room in the dead of night ~ ~ with me solo polo vision -That's right! ~ ~ Im a cockney geezer, watch me bleed ya I knew the Ripper when he was just a nipper ~ ~ I taught him how to slice, I cut him up a treat -Pound your banana -Two pound your pear ~ ~ -Pound your banana. -Two pound your pear -Pound your banana. -Two pound your pear ~ ~ -Fourteen shillings for your melons -Oh yeah! ~ ~ We're the Piper twins, Jim and Jackie Piper We cut through the night like a windscreen ~ ~ wiping you away like rain drops don't mess with the boys.. ~ ~ Shut your noise! ~ ~ Coming in stong like a freak show nightmare dancing skeletons, white, blue and yellow ones ~ ~ Moving through the shadows with the speed of a cat ~ ~ -And if you cross us we'll cut ya. -And you ain't gona like that! ~ ~ I'm bad juju, I use voodoo if I choose to I harness the power of evil to abuse you ~ ~ With power, a polo, an evil magnet we're sucking up your soul ~ ~ And you ain't gonna like that! ~ - Here you are boys, take that, off you go.. -Alright boss. -..get around Brixton and create havoc. -Alright boss. I'm a cockney, I'm a cockney, I'm a cockney.. We all are, you nonce! Allright Brixton, how are you? You're alright you slags! Yeah! Ooh it feels good to be out of the box, oooh it feels good. Two hundred years I've been trapped inside this here box, two hundred years Brixton! For crimes against humanity! That's right - I've raped a dolphin! Well technically speakin' it was a porpoise. But one blow-hole's the same as the next to me! Lot of people are goin': Ooh the whale, ooh save the whale, the marine wildlife, they're all intelligent, don't hurt them. I'll fucking save them! Bring'em over here! That whale what they found in the Thames? That was me what took him there in a lorry! Get in the back we're all going out for a picnic!

Get in there with the johnnies! I'll reverse drown your arse! I'm evil Brixton! I'm... I'm a nob! I spent all last week driving contaminated swans to Fife. Pullin'em out of back of the van, breakin' their necks, throwing them on the floor, leaving a sachet of Lemsip and creepin' off into the night. I'm EVIL! I once kicked a racoon's face right off its body! What its face was doin' on its body I have no fuckin' idea. Faces should be covering heads! You're a freak of nature! I told him I was doin' him a favour! Bang! Kicked it right off! It flew through the air like a pancake and landed on Jesus's face. I didn't mean it to, but it was a cheeky bonus! A very cheeky bonus.. Anyway, you'll have to excuse me, I've been in that box two hundred years, I need a sprinkle. There's no toilets in there, excuse me ladies and getlemen, while I piss like a powerful mule. Ooooh! Ooooh yeaaah! Comin' out of me like a yellow cable! Oh I have had a Berocca!

I'm a cockney, I'm a cockney - oh, I can't get off this way, fuck! Hello everyone! I'm so happy to be here. I'm the Moon, I'm so happy. In the sixties, a man come in and he put a flag in my belly. And he driving around in the buggy.. and did jump around. One small step for mankind and one big step for the Moon. He not been back since. Should I have made him a cuppa tea? When did he only come once? Has he seen all he needed to? I've got a bad feeling about this.. Naboo? This is it Bollo. I'm close to the end.. ..fading away... Do not fear my friend. Maybe I will see you. In the next life. I doubt it. I'm going to heaven. Do animals not go to heaven? Well yeah, but you killed that boy. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. What are you doing? -Sorry I thought you were gone. -Just havin' a powernap. Now! It's comin'.. No, that's not it.. Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. No..... ~ Naboolio, why did you have to go? ~ ~ Naboolio, we really loved you so! ~ ~ I heard you sing, you had a velvet voice. The way you danced, I really had no choice. ~ ~ Naboolio, why did you leave us so? ~ ~ Naboolio, why did you have to go? ~ ~ -Boolio, Boolio, why did you have to go, leave me solo? -Give it up now, for Naboolio. ~ ~ -Boolio, Boolio, why did you have to go, leave me solo. -Give it up now for Naboolio. ~ ~ Sucking on my titties, like you loving me, wanting me, squeezing me, baby, come on - you know you want it. ~ ~ Sucking on my titties, like you loving me, hun. Squeezing me, teasing me. Baby, yeah, baby come on, uh! ~ ~ Sucking on my titties, like you... ~ What are you doing?! Sorry, I got a bit carried away... Peter? Naboo is dead! But there is a way, to bring a shaman back to live. You must retrieve the sacred Ruby of Kukundu. It is to be found deep in the Arctic tundra... -Let's go! -..or Spain. -Arctic tundra or Spain? -Yeah, I can't remember which one it is, sorry. Yeah, they're quite far apart Bollo, you know? You could be little bit more specific. No. Sucking on my titties, like you loving me, wanting me, squeezing me. Baby, yeah, uh - come on! Well there you have it - that's the end of the first half, things are hotting up. -Naboo's dead. -Yep, bit of a shocker. Bollo's gone insane with greif. So we're left to retrieve the Ruby of Kukundu. Hm.. the second half. Will we find it? Won't we? Will we? Won't we? Will we? Won't we? We will. But uh... But will we? We will. Will we find it? We will find it. So - I suggest I'll go to Spain, you know, you'll go to the Arctic and we'll see how we do, yeah? Yeah? Maybe I'll go to Spain though eh? No no I'll go to Spain, because I'm Spanish. So.. you should go to the Arctic and I'll.. -As if you're Spanish. -..I'll do the Spanish leg. -Well, I'm a Spaniard - you know, I'm deeply Spanish. -What? -Oh yeah yeah yeah. -Get lost! - I'm well Spanish. -Well Spanish? What are you a chav? I'm well Spanish, mate. Yeah? I'm El Chaviola. Sun-dried Chaviola. Come on, but - come on, you're not Spanish! You're clearly.. -I am! -You're not! You're clearly from Leeds. Ha ha ha? Nothing. Great help that.. -Listen.. -Then leave. Are you possessed? By a twat? -Listen - you're not Spanish. -I am. You're not Spanish - you're clearly from Leeds. I've seen the way you talk to women. Huh, you dirty cow, get in my wheelbarrow, cm'on! -Listen... I was..don't talk about that, alright? -It was brilliant though! Huh, you cheeky vixens, there's room for all of ya' in Barratt's barrow, cm'on! I was drunk.. I know, so was I - I was in the wheelbarrow. Alright, well we're gonna have decide who goes where, one way or the other, alright? I suggest we toss a coin. -Have any coins about your person? -I haven't got any pockets. You leave that to me. -Okay, heads or tails? -Aaa.. tails! -Oh, what a cunt! -Yeah! It was a mime coin, he could have said anything. What a spazz. That wasn't very PC (Politically Correct), was it? You all laughed, we're in it together. See you in hell. So basically that is the end of the first half, go and have a drink, have a wee-wee and.. Aaaa fuck! Watch out, watch out! No, get away! The only problem with be.. with when you are the Moon - like me - is, you have such a chalky white face, it makes your teeth look yellow. And I went to the dentist and he said: Ooh your teeth are yellow! I said: Noo! Only when you compare them to my chalky white face. If I had skin - like yours - they would not look yellow! I had fifteen fillings and he said: That will be ?500 . And I said: I don't pay for nothing! I'm the Moon! And I rised out of the chair and I went off back up and he couldn't stop me. Every now and then I recieve letter 'You still owe that money!' I say I might pay it, I might not. I'm the Moon, I don't pay fucking dental fees! Don't patronize me. Howard Moon's journal - day thirty-seven. Still no sign of the Ruby of Kukundu. The Arctic is a very lonely place, so lonely here.. ..wind my only friend. I hate you! Shut up wind! The Arctic is a very strange environment - the days are very short here. Luckily the nights are even shorter. Ha, where are you from? Day thirty-eight. A strange figure approaches from the horizon. Could this be my salvation? Look deep into the parka! What? Look deep into the parka! Why? There are many things in here. Things you could never dream of! Like what? Omelettes..? I've dreamt of omelettes. And I dream of omeletts quite a lot actually. They call me The Omelette-dreamer. Oh, hm.. okay then.. um.. unicorns? With AIDS? -Have you dreamt of those? -No. Hahaa! Look deep into the parka, my friend. Delve deep into the parka, for whatever you dream of will become yours. Aaaah not that you idiot! That's my fucking eye! What are you doin'?! -Sorry.. -Ooh anything but that! -Oooh Christ! -I'm really sorry. Ooh, don't just put it in loose! Look at me! I'm like.. Swingball. -Enough! Enough Swingball! -Sorry. Sorry - there you go, I'll just.. it's in your pocket, look. Oh that's where that pen went. Now, look deep into the parka the second time. The good stuff's laid out at the front. Delve in there. Other side. -What's this? -Telegram. Oh, thanks. Well, don't go! I'm just gonna put the kettle on. Stick around and have a cuppa tea and a chat.. No thanks. Why? Where are you going? Opticians. Well, if my hunch is correct, this telegram should lead me directly to the Ruby of Kukundu. Dear Howard, thank you for the picture of your cock and balls.. I never sent that! Howard Moon's journal - day thirty-eight. Must I end my life in this wilderness of ice and snow, oh woe.. ~ All the things I'll never be All the things I'll never see ~ ~ All there is that's left for me Is here in this eternity ~ ~ Of isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation. ~ ~ The cavalcade, the jamboree Of life I thought was meant for me ~ ~ I never dreamed that it would be Replaced by this eternity ~ ~ Of isolation, isolation. ~ ~ All the things I'll never be All the things I'll never see ~ ~ All there is that's left for me ~ ~ Is here in this eternity of isolation, isolation! ~ Reasonably priced in the foyer. Yes, meanwhile in Spain. Hey, you guys, it's brilliant! I'm lovin' it here in Spain! Hey, have any of you heard of The Ruby of Kukundu? Sorry about that.. You did a bad thing! You're fuckin' dead after the show! At least I am protected by the script. Oh yeah, the irony - the man protected by something he's never been in contact with. Yeah, it's good, isn't it? What are you laughing at? Listen... It's the first time he has laughed from this whole tour! Don't laugh! Listen! I need to speak with you alone. Solid, Gas get out of here, right now! Bring your shitty quitar with you. I have some business to do. -You did a very bad thing! -I did a bad thing?! Yes! You nearly broke my nose! I ate a bowl of yeast before the show, so.. Sorry about that. It's something I do, I'm on a.. Atkins diet.. Listen - ... -You mentioned The Ruby of Kukundu. -Yeah, so what? Many men have mentioned this ruby and many men have been dyed! Oh really? What colour? I am slightly retarded. I'm on the fence either way. What - the retarded fence? Yeah, you know.. -Aaah what are you doin'? -I know a man.. -I know a... -Get out of my hat-space! -I know, these are fuckin' big hats! -What's wrong with you? It's like doing a scene with a chimp! -It's just a figure of speech, Bollo. -Ah, okay. Adios. -I know of a guy over there.. -Aaah.. -Look, talk to me and then we'll face out together. -Okay. I know of a guy.. ..over there. Who can tell you, where the Ruby is. He lives in the Forest of Doom. The Foyer of Doom? Yes. Just past the Mountain of Merchandise. -He can tell you where the Ruby is. -Cool. Okay, excellent and what's he gonna do? Piss on my face? Don't be silly - I am not playing that character. -Okay, bye. -Okay, good luck my friend. -Yeah, seeya. -Goodbye. Get off. -But do not tell anyone. -What? -Do not tell anyone I told you about this. -Okay. Or surely I will be killed by murder. -Okay. -Okay, goodbye. -Okay seeya. So this wiseman, yeah? He's over by the Forest of Doom? Aaa you silly bitch! I forgot:) And so Vince Noir set off on his terrifying journey towards the Forest of Doom. Utilizing basic mime technique. He walked. And then he moonwalked for a bit. I've got the wrong shoes on, shut up! Yes, that was pretty bad. Rubber on rubber - it was never gonna work. Don't try and body-pop your way out of it. Onwards he walked mile after mile, mile after terrifying mile towards the Forest of Doom. Mile after mile... you're going the wrong way. The sign.. yes. You've got his sign you prick! Onwards, ever onwards, he encountered a terrifying hurricane. Oh dear.. The hurricane messed up Vince's neatly arranged coiffure. -I don't think it did. -Yes, it did. It didn't! It's weird, but it didn't. Get off me! He told me to do it. I am the narrator - he does my bidding. After dealing with the hurricane/cagoule he carried on and eventually arrived at the fabled Forest of Doom! Theatre.. Who are you? I go by many names. Well what are they then? I'm getting around to that. I'm just leaving a mystical pause. Some call me.. Mystery Man. Others know me as the Shadow Dweller. Some call me Secret Peter. Where is he hiding? In a shoe, in a bush, in a rock, in a side cupboard, in a lane? No! He's inside yourself. Some call me Miraculous Mark - diviner of mysteries. Others call me Heeeeeeeeeeeeey.. ..Smith. Some call me Halaaaooooooo - . [hits drum] that's my surname. Others know me as Domino. The Bounty hunter. Some call me Chilli Chicken Ramen. Others know me as Clive. I'm sometimes called Peppercorn.. ..by the Dutch. You can step in at any point here, you know? Don't have to leave me dangling like a tit in a breeze. Go on, do one more. Some call me Cillit Bang. I go by many names! But you may call me Rudy. You are searching for something here in the forest, are you not little girl? Yeah, how do you know? -I know all things. -Are you a witch? Yes, I am. Take a seat. I shall explain to you a thing or two about the forest. There's no seats in the forest. Do not be afraid. I control the very forest itself. Behold! Khalamaloooooo, khalamalamaloooooo, khalamala-bring-a-chair, khalamalooooooh... Hm, the forest is a cheeky one tonight. The forest is a cunt tonight. Soo... Look, you're on mushrooms. Hey, where are thou from? You're looking pretty high yourself. I'm off my tits on dental cream. I don't know where I am. I appear to be in a psychedelic episode of Parkinson. So you've got a new book coming out, um... No, tell me about it. It's about gardening, yeah? Never mind that Parky, what's happened to your hair? I slept funny. You are searching for something here in the Forest of Doom, are you not? What is it you seek? Basically I'm looking for the Ruby of Kukundu. The Ruby of Kukundu? Yeah, the Ruby of Kukundu. The Ruby of Kukundu? No! Okay, it was fun, but now it's over. Yes I know the whereabouts of the Ruby of Kukundu, yay I know the whereabouts of the Ruby of Kuku.., yes I know. But I cannot just divulge the informations to whereabouts of the Ruby like this. I need to know that you're a kind of heart and worthy of the information. You must prove this to me by passing a test. Cool, what test? The cycling proficiency test. Know ye of this test? Yeah, I passed that ages ago, when I was at school. It was easy. Ain't you something! Ain't you a little piece of something else. Ain't you a little stinking piece of something. Well then, if thou art such a cockian, perhaps another test is in order for thou. -Yeah? -Perhaps thou would be less cocky when faced.. ..with the Black Rider! The most dangerous gun-fighter in the forest, who you must fight - tonight at midnight! Yeah, Rudy it's one o'clock. I'm not spending another eleven hours with you and your speech impediment. See if I can hurry this along a little bit. Excuse me. It's my scat-phone. Hello, Black Riders. Hello, um.. I've ordered a Black Rider for midnight, I might need something a little bit earlier. I just wondered if you had anything in the area. -Where are you mate? -The Forest of Doom. -Where mate? -Brixton. Alright, he should be with you in a few moments. -Okay, thanks, um.. I just wondered.. how much was that going to be? - It's gonna be about twelve, thirteen quid mate. -Ouch.. Okay thanks a lot, you've been very kind, thank you. -Fuck off. Prepare thyself! The Black Rider approaches. You have passed the test! And now it is time for you to recieve the Ruby of Kukundu. Take the Ruby and do with it what you will, pretty prince-girl. Yeah, Rudy - this is a Kinderegg. Kinderegg? What is Kinderegg? It's kind of a chocolatey treat with a toy inside. Oh.. I'm sorry I thought it was a Ruby, I can only apologize and wish you luck with your quest. Shut your mouth. Or I shall fly at you like a bag of cocks! And you'll receive him like a satchel of vaginas! Tag team put downs. What is a Kinderegg? It's basically - it's like a chocolatey treat, but you get like a toy inside, yeah? So they are amazing, sometimes you get to build like a hovercraft, yeah? A hover - what is a hovercraft? I haven't got time to explain, other times you get like a porcelain alligator playing golf - that's not quite as good, but they're pretty spot on. -Hm.. sounds intriguing. -Yeah, you might as well have that, if you've never had one. -For me? -Yeah! Take it. Thank you. No worries, take care Rudy, thanks for your help, bye. Wait! You have passed the test. -What test? -The Kinder-test. Most men would have eaten the Kinderegg. -Wolf it down quick as a bee. -Yeah? But you - knowing I had never tasted its chocolatey fruit - offered it to me. Because you are kind of heart. Thus I can tell you the whereabouts of the Ruby of Kukundu. It is far far away my friend... Fa.. this way - far away - in the Arctic tundra. You're in the wrong place sunny Jim lad. Excellent I.. that's brilliant - I'll go there right now. Thanks Rudy, I don't know what to say, you've been brilliant! Don't say anything, simply caress my balls. I'm not doin' that. You have passed the test! -What test? -The ball-test. The ball-test?! -Yes, most men would have caressed my balls.. -Seeya.. Bye bye. Sorry. Oh I did a burp. When the Moon burps, Jupiter looks on disgusted. I like Jupiter and I like Mars, but Pluto - he don't talk to me. He pretends I'm not there. Hello Pluto..? Nothing, just carries on with what he's doing. I don't know why he don't like me.. Saturn is crazy, he's fuckin' crazy. He drinks all the time, he comes in he's all pissed. And he's a good cook, but he's too drunk, he sets fire to his fish fingers. One time I went out with him and he was funny. This dog's not doing as much work as this one. What are you doin'? This must be Howard's tent. He's left me a little note. Let's have a look. -I, Howard Moon.. -I haven't opened it yet! ..have decided to head to North in my quest to find the Ruby of Kukundu.. -There's nothing on this. -If you find this note, then heed my advice. The Artcic is a dangerous place, there are strange creatures here. I have heard their calls in the night. So be on your guard and what ever you do, never fall asleep. Aaah fuck! I thought we were getting on quite well, what about a phone number? Do some work. Pretty fuckin' good our sound man! Better not fall asleep this time. I'll come on again. Vince? Vince? Vince! Oh, Yetti, I knew you'd return. Oh sorry I thought you were someone else. Hey Howard, howyerdoin'? Are you llright? -Yeah, I'm good, thanks. -Yeah? Come on, let's get out of here. -No, I'm not leaving this place. -Hm..? -I'll never leave this place Vince. -What do you mean? I'm on a mission, I shall never leave this place until I have found the Ruby of Kukundu. Never would I leave this sacred place until I have found that Ruby! -Yeah - is that it? Yep. -Shall we go then? -Yeah, alright. Okay. And so Vince Noir - he went to Topshop and uh.. Howard he took the Ruby and he gave it to Bollo. I think that's what was happening I don't know, I weren't watching. I was havin' a wank. And now it is time - shut up - to bring a shaman back to life. Not so fast, monkeyman! Hand over that Ruby, boy, looks like it could be worth a few euros to me. -No. For I need it to bring little Naboo back to life. -Oh really? -Yeah. -Oh really? -Yeah! -That's what you're gonna do, is it? Yeah! Huh... Nooo... Nooo - nooooo.... aaaaaa..... Look Peter! Look at my acting Peter! Look at I can do Peter, look! Nooo... no.. now! Fuck! Peter, did I get the part Peter? Of course you fuckin' didn't get the part, mate. It's already been and gone at the cinema ain't it?! -What?! -It's on DVD you berk! Yeah! Yeah, right in the face! No open coffin for Bollo! Aaaa you've killed my friend and former lover! If that ain't the geezer who likes to spit in other people's faces! Ooh, oooh, oooh m'nuts! Bye everybody, oh uh Bollo, oh Bollo. Bollo, Bollo, Bollo.. What is the matter with you?! I told you it was a summer fling! I'm deeaad, I'm deeaad, I'm deeaad... I wish you were, pal. Well there you have it Brixton! That's the end of the show, everyone's fuckin' dead! Naboo - the so-called enigma - dead as a doormat. Yeah, whatever. Bollo - the fuckin' hammy ape - dead also. The geezer in the light blue outfit - I don't even know his fuckin' name, the septic tank - he's dead as well! Alright that's it, everyone's dead - I know what you're thinking Brixton. I know what you're thinkin' I know how you fuckers think, you're thinking where's the geezer who likes jazz, where's the geezer with the moustache, he'll save the day. Yeah? Well will he really? I saw him backstage farting about with a trumpet sock. A trumpet sock, you idiot? So I cut his fuckin' head off. I know what else you're thinking, where's the geezer who looks like a bird, he'll save the day. The one who dresses like a lady! No he won't! He's here. I found him in Topshop. I found him in Topshop with six items in a cubical! Six items? You're only allowed four, you slag! What do you think are the fuckin' sign's for? So I chopped his head off and I fucked his stump! That's right ladys and gentlemen, I'm a stump-fucker! Welcome to the concept of stump-fucking! The double-stump-fuck. If there are any little'uns in tonight.. ..I just wanna say it's S T U M P ! Stump-fuckin'! Get it right when you tell your mates in the playground tomorrow! Stump-fucking - a concept we couldn't quite get past BBC3. We wanted to call our show The Mighty Stump-fuckers! And they said: 'If you do that, you'll have to go on a little bit later.' And we said: 'Is that physically fuckin' possible?' We'll go on when we always go on! After two pints of fuckin' lager and packet of crisps! That's the end of the show! -Now all fuck off!! -Not so fast! -What? -Yes! -Christ! Ooh check me out! I've got you surrounded, sir! Jesus! It's like Woodstock meets Tour de France! -Who are you? -I go by many names. Yeah, I heard all this shit backstage, move it along, would you, pal? Hush your lips. Or I shall slice them off. Place them upon your mother.. ..and kiss her. Oh yes, squire, what with? With cold steel! Well maybe I'll tear your nose off at the root and flick it up the vicars anus! With cold steel, mind? I'm fuckin' warning you Flipper! On guard. Crikey! Ooh, I tore all the skin under my armpit! Oooh help me boy, help me! -We'll have to call the whole fight off. -Are you okay? Ooh I've done something wrong.. -Can I help you? -I'm bleeding inside, help me boy - help me. You fight well. For a Jimmy Savile impersonater. Shut up or I'll fix it for you. And you, and you, and you! You fight well yourself mate, for a geezer in a purple dress. This is not a dress. This is the sacred robe of the psychedelic monks. So I think the joke's on you. Well it goes nicely with your little bicycle. Oh really? Now then, now then! I think you'll find Jimmy can still move when he needs to. -You can never win, you know? -Oh yeah, pal, why is that? Because I taught you everything you know. You might taught me everything I know, but you didn't teach me everything you know. -You know.. I know.. oh fuck! -What does that mean? Ooh take that you slag! Take that you nonce! -Oooh Jesus! Oooh crikey! - Get off! No! Leave me alone! -You're too strong for me! -Oh yeah, oh that's bad! No! You're spoiling the illusion! Take that! How do we do it? The magic of theatre. -Let's end this, one way or the other, you slag. -Bring it on, Terry Nutkins. Oooh Crikey oooh ooh look at me, me go faster stripe's come loose. I'm only an old man, luckily I've still got one trick left up my Lambeth sleeve. Cock punchin'! Oooh my fiery biscuit! When in doubt, ladies and gentlemen, release the middle digit! The cockney cock-puncher! He punches one way, he punches the other, he punches diagonal, he's like connect four in cock-punchin' terms. Yeah, there's no one that can save you now Leo Sayer! What? No! Christ! No! Oooh fuck! No! Big leg! Here comes Big leg! He's got a big fuckin' leg! Big leg! Thank you Big leg! And now all it is left to do is bring the tiny shaman back to life. Let the magic commence. I'm alive! So with the power of the Ruby brought Naboo back to life. Restoring his powers. He flew high into the night sky like a tiny blue Snoop dog. Look at him move, look at him move, look at his mother-lovin' shaman grooves. And what of Fossil and Bollo? He restored them back to life! -Yeah! I'm alive! -The power of Ruby! Knew no bounds.

I'm the Moon - I don't hang out with ball bags. -Okay, um... do you want me to..? -Do you wanna sign for this? -Yeah, do you have a pen? -I don't have a pen, no. Right, don't worry about that. -That's very good. I like that. -So, okay well.. I don't know what you're doing later, but um... You mean I'm.. I'm sort of free later on, my diary's freed up somewhat this evening so.. If you.. I don't think.. We've had some bad dealings in the past, but if you want to sort of go for a meal and to resolve some difficulties.. -I could.. -A meal? With you? -With Howard Moon? -Oh yeah, why not? You know, something I once saw a man like you in Burma, I saw him hang, I helped him hang. I can do the same for you. -So is that a NO then? -That's a big NO, my friend. But uh...
