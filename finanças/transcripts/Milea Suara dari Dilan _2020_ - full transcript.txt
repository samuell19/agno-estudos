I've read both books written by Pidi Baiq. I can honestly tell you that it felt like finding a long-lost life. I never expected somebody would write books about Lia and me. He portrayed me as this overly romantic guy and the most eligible bachelor in the world. Then on August 15, 2015 Pidi Baiq came to my house and told me about his idea of writing a new book titled "Dilan's Voice". I laughed at his idea. But he convinced me that people could learn from it, including me. I know I should respect Lia's decision. Still, the two of us have an equal say in it. IF LOVE ISN'T BEAUTIFUL, YOU CHOSE THE WRONG PERSON Since it's our romance in the first place. This is how I remember the story without the parts already told by Lia. But you'll have to excuse me, I'm not as good as Lia in describing my feelings. This is my mother, "Subojawo" or a Sumatran born Javanese woman. She was born in Aceh. I call her Bunda. But when I need money, I call her Bundahara, a cashier. And when I'm hungry, I call her Saribunda. Like the name of a Padang restaurant. And this is my aunt Halimah. What do you want to be when you grow up? Get married. - Wow, he's smart. - I know, I'm proud of him. I'm proud of you too, Bunda. - Please, don't ruin Dad's picture. - I'm going to make it better. Please don't. - Can I come in? - Who is it? It's your mom. Come in! Dad just called. He said it's time to go to bed now. You love your dad, right? Let's go. I'm going to cast my sleeping spell on you. Alakazam! This is my father. He is from Bandung. When I was little, I thought he was a nomad, like Abraham from the book. But actually, he served in the army and was stationed in different cities all around the nation. He communicates with us in many ways. Including the one he used when he caught me sneaking in late at night. - Who are you? - Dilan. - Who's your mother? - Bunda. - Who's your father? - You are! Your scooter is made in Japan. I'm telling you, working for the Japanese today is way better than years ago. Why? When you worked for Japanese back then, you were called Romusha, or slaves. Who's doing the dishes tonight? Who's the slave? Apparently, I'm the Romusha tonight. You are all the Japanese masters. Bibi, too. One time he brought us all to East Timor where he was stationed. Just for a year though. Then we settled in Bandung because Mom was hired as a principal in some school. - Is your scooter still in the garage? - Yeah. I think you're a smart kid. Do you mean "your kid"? I don't think I'm Smart's kid. Well, you are my kid. I won't keep you from hanging out with those kids, because I know they won't be a bad influence on you. What influence? Drugs, crimes, being a delinquent... You know when they beat you up and stabbed you into a coma? How would I know? I was in a coma. When you were in a coma, I was devastated. I was afraid of losing you. Personally, I don't think biker gangs were as bad as Lia thinks. She thinks we spent half of our lives to make our gang the best biker gang. We don't, at all. This is our Bandung! Our birthplace! Don't mess with our town! Biker gangs are not outlaws. But evil people and criminals are. And corrupt officials. Check. Abolish school. - Hi, guys. - Hi. Hot tea, please. Hey. Guys. Akew wants to abolish school. No way! My mom's a school principal. How's Susi? Still. - Still what? - Still a girl. Forget about Susi. There's a new girl in school. Have you guys met her? - What new girl? - Her name is Milea. - Where does she come from? - Jakarta. Is she majoring in science? She's cute. - I wonder what she looks like. - You'll see. Are you talking about Remi? Show us your tarot cards. Okay. You hurt my poor eyes. Now, let's read the cards. I'm so nervous! Pick a card. Lovers. Hey! My turn. - Free of charge? - Pay me by kissing Burhan. - Bite me. - I'd rather not, thank you. This one. - Are you sure? - Yeah. My dear God! You picked Ten of Swords card, which means you're going to turn into the real Demi Moore very soon. Where's my tea? Later, guys. Lan! Where are you going? - I have a movie date with Susi. - Oh, really? Aren't you going to invite us too? Dilan. I like you. Stupid. Piyan, what's the new girl's name again? Milea, I think. Milea. I think I saw her once. She's cute. Check. Do you think... she can be my girlfriend? - Inshallah. - Inshallah. See you tomorrow. Wa'alaykumussalam. Who was that? A friend. Mom... - Bless this water. - What for? Just do it, please? Answer the question first. A mother's prayer is not for jokes. I want to impress a girl tomorrow. Please. - Amen. - Amen. Thanks, Mom. Pardon me. "A mother's prayer." He sounds like a bumper sticker. I know, right? He's hilarious. Good morning. Morning. Are you Milea? Yeah. - I can read your future if you want. - Read my future? Yeah. I see us meeting again this afternoon in the cafeteria. That was the day when I started trying to get the new girl's attention, Milea Adnan Hussain. Milea, you're beautiful. ♪ Should I talk ♪ But I don't love you yet. But by this afternoon, who knows? Let's just wait and see. ♪ That loving you ♪ ♪ Is more than what you want ♪ ♪ To hear ♪ FOR MILEA ♪ Hopefully ♪ Read it, Milea! - How do you know my address? - I know your birthday too. - I even know your God. - Allah. Mine too. I'll see you around. Aren't you going to say goodbye? - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. ♪ I am responsible ♪ ♪ Just stay with me ♪ ♪ There are so many better ways To live with me ♪ Why did you cross out all names except yours? - Everybody will fail. - Except you? Yeah. Wish me luck. ♪ Hopefully ♪ - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. The school cafeteria sent me to inform Milea that we now serve batagor in three flavors. We need to inform her because we know she really loves batagor. - That's all? - Yes, sir. I'll leave now. Okay. - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Can I talk to Milea? - Sure, Milea speaking. I'm Dilan. Oh, hi. - I went to your house earlier. - I know. You posed as a cafeteria's staff. Because I know how much you love food. Where are you? Who? - You. - You who? Dilan. ♪ I am responsible ♪ - Can I read your future? - What is it? I was so enchanted by her, she gave me strength to approach her. ♪ There are so many better ways To live with me ♪ Excuse me, sir. Happy birthday, Milea.

It's a solved crossword puzzle book. I love you, and I hate to imagine you having a hard time solving them. Dilan. - Milea. - Yes, Dilan? - Don't ever tell me if somebody hurt you. - But why? I will make them disappear. It wasn't easy to win her heart, but she was worth it. ♪ Hopefully, all of my doings Are the best part of it all ♪ And I didn't come home empty handed. After all I've done, I won her heart. ♪ Amen ♪ He's Adi. My private tutor. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hello? - Hello, Lia. - Are you home yet? - Hold on, let me ask a random person. Never mind. Is Adi still there? Yeah, he's asking me to go with him to ITB tomorrow. Are you jealous he's asking me out? Jealousy is for the weak. So? Tonight I am weak. And maybe I'll still be the day after. - Then I won't go with him. - I'm not saying you shouldn't. I won't go with him, I promise. - Go to bed, don't stay up late. - You too. - And don't miss me. - Why not? It's a heavy burden. You're not that strong to carry it. Let me carry it instead. - Good night, Lia. - Good night, Dilan. There are many flavors of happiness. All of which ended... the day I found out that she went with Adi anyway. - Thanks for the ride. - You're welcome. - Miss Lia. - Yes? - There was a phone call for you. - From who? - Dilan. - Oh, gosh. Lia lied to me. She said she wouldn't go, but she did. I was upset and decided to vent out my anger by hanging out with my friends that day. - Where's Milea? - No idea. Did you have a fight? No. - Who is it? - It's me. Come in. - What's up? - Goodness gracious! You startled me. - Miss Lia called. - What did she say? I don't know. She talked to your mom. Well, thank you for telling me. - Hello? - Hello. Assalamu'alaykum. Wa'alaykumussalam. It's Dilan. Is Milea there? Hi, Dilan. Lia has already left for school. Oh, okay then. Wait, can we have a talk? - Sure, what is it about? - Well... Last night Lia told me... about going with Adi to ITB. She said she promised you she wouldn't go, but she did anyway. She's feeling guilty now. Please forgive me, Dilan. She was very upset. She cried all night. - Everything is all right. - Are you sure? I guess I was angry. A little bit. It may be a bit, but you're still angry at her. My heart broke when I saw her crying. Please talk to her. - All right, ma'am. - Thank you, Dilan. - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. Bi! Bi! Bi Eem! - Dilan. - Nobody's here? The others are still at school. - Oh, I forgot. - Sorry, I was praying in the back. Have you heard about Milea? What about her? Well... What is it? - She had a fight. - A fight? With whom? - With Anhar. - Anhar? First they were just yelling at each other, but then he suddenly slapped her. So she cried. Dilan! Dilan! That was the worst day of my life. Fighting with your own best friend is really the worst. I knew it was wrong and I understood how Anhar must have felt. He must have thought that Lia stole all of my time that should be spent with the gang. Dilan! Anhar! - Dilan! Dilan, stop it. - Stop it right now! Stop it. Not only Anhar... I'll burn this school down if the principal ever lays a finger on Lia! Calm down, Dilan. When he slapped Lia, he didn't realize he had slapped my pride too. Well, Lia... I don't think iodine alone would be enough to heal my wound. It's better than leaving it untreated. But a kiss should heal it. Do you want me to? Will you? - Has it healed yet? - Right away. Actually, that was a beautiful day after all. - You must sign it too. - Yes. Because that day, December 22, 1990, I officially became Lia's boyfriend. However, my fight with Anhar was the third strike for me. I was expelled from school a few days later. Yet somehow my problem with Anhar was far from over since his brother and his gang came and beat me. Bi! - Where have you been, Dilan? - Doing my job, combating crimes. - That's Superman's job. - I never see him here in Indonesia. - Can I have a cup of coffee? - Sure. - Thanks. - You should invite Superman here. - You want to be a tough guy, huh? - What the... Oh, my God! Hey! Get out! Out! Dilan? Help! Where is everybody? Help! Lia. - It's Dilan. - What happened? - He had a fight. - What? Slowly. Nice and easy. Who did you fight with? Who did you fight with, Dilan? Some CIA agents. Tell me, seriously. - Bi. - Yeah? - Can you tell me who they were? - I knew nothing about them. I left Dilan eating here alone and then these four guys came out of nowhere and beat him up. That night we gathered at Burhan's house and planned to take revenge on Anhar's brother. - We should settle this like family. - What for? I'm not his family. I have the power to do whatever is necessary to defend my dignity. Calm down. How about we ask Anhar to come and talk? Or maybe he can bring his brother too. His brother didn't come to me to talk. They just came and started punching. Those douchebags. Just give them a lesson. I know, but-- What? Just drop it. - Are you sure? - What am I supposed to do? - Dilan. - Yes? - Can we talk privately? - Okay. - How did you get here? - I'll tell you later. What's up? What are you doing up at this hour? - Just hanging out with the boys. - Are you planning to attack them? What are you talking about? You're planning a revenge against Anhar's brother, aren't you? - Who told you that? - It doesn't matter. Did some spirit tell you? If you attack them, I don't want to see you again. Who said I'm going to attack? Tell me. Who told you? You don't need to know. The point is, I forbid you. - What are you forbidding me to do? - I'm forbidding you to take revenge! I don't quite follow you. Listen to me, don't do it. Or I'm done with you. Lia... I hate your tough guy act. That's all, I'm going. - You jerk. - Lia! - What's wrong with you? - What? Lia... what's going on? Nothing. Is there a problem, bro? Ask Lia. - Lia? - Just go home. I won't leave you in trouble. I'm fine. Just wait in the car. I took you here. I have a responsibility to your mom to keep you safe. Dilan! We're done talking, right? Didn't you say you want to go home? Fine, I'll go. Take care. Bye! Who's that guy with Lia? Are we going to Centrum now? - Yeah. - Let's go to Centrum! That night, Lia made a mistake by coming with a man I didn't know. I couldn't stop thinking about it. It screwed my mind up so badly. Forgive me, Lia. I love you. But I was burning with jealousy. If only you knew. - Are you ready? - Yes. We have to do this tonight. Let's go. As usual, don't forget the strategy. Stay in groups, finish the leader and leave. What are you doing here? Are you going to beat up Endi? He's Anhar's brother. It's none of your business. Peace, man. We're family. We've been long-time friends. What kind of friends are they? They beat me up! Calm down, man. Police! - Run! - Put on your masks! Go, go! Where's Anhar? Go, go! Turn off your headlights! - Freeze! Hands up! - Freeze! - He has a gun. - Secure it! - He's Mr. Ical's son, sir. - Arrest him. Get in the car! POLICE - Hello. - Hello, Bi, is Dilan home yet? Not yet, Miss. But the police just called. They said they arrested him. BUAH BATU POLICE STATION - Here she is. - Thank you, officer. - Hi. - Hi. I'm okay. Why do you come this late? I wanted to come this afternoon, but I couldn't leave early. Faris dropped me off here, he's going to pick me up later. Let's talk outside. - Can we do that? - Well, there's the door. - I mean, are we allowed to do that? - Sure. As long as I love you. Let's go. I've brought you some bread. I just want you. You can have it all. All of what? Me. - And all your clothes? - Not that. - My mom made them. - With your dad's help? No, all by herself. Do you know that your mom made you? With your dad's help. The guy who's with me at Trina last night, his name is Yugo. He's a distant cousin. He was visiting. - I thought he was your guardian spirit. - I have no relation to him. Distant cousin means he's your family. When I left Trina, I thought you'd be jealous. That's not my thing. - I was afraid you might be upset. - Lame. Don't be a coward. Are you sure you're not jealous? I'm not good at being jealous. The thing I'm good at is loving you. My relationship with Lia went back to normal after that night. Sure. Ten-hut! Although I knew she tightened her grip on me. I know... I swear I'm going to leave you if you do that again. Okay. Hello? Lia? Hello? Well, that's Lia. Unlike her, I think life is not all about romance. My friendship with the boys is equally important. I'm your girlfriend. You should've listened to me. And that stupid Burhan, or that queer, Anhar. Please stop talking trash about my friends. Why not? Why can't I talk trash about them? I'm not afraid of your biker gang. Tell your friends that I don't like them. Lunch is ready. Your mom insists. I really wanted to handle everything with a safe and loving approach. Sorry I often yelled at you. That's normal. What's not normal is if you yell at someone else's boyfriend. How come you never yell back at me? Do you see those girls? Pretty girls are not hard to find. But you're the only pretty girl who wants me. Susi is pretty and she wants you too. I bet she must have been dying to be you. Why? Because that's the only way I would want her. I don't think I want to take the PMDK test. What does PMDK stand for? Praja Muda Karana. Praja Muda... Where's the D? - Who knows? - Crazy. Are you guys having fun? What are you talking about? Erni's future boyfriend wants to take the PMDK test. - Amen. - Are you sure? - Amen for what? - Amen for both. - Please God, amen. - Amen. How about my boyfriend? He wants to be a villain in Superman movies. But villains are evil. His movies wouldn't be as exciting without villains. But if you became a villain, I wouldn't want to be your girlfriend. I'd be afraid of you. Listen, I'll tell you something. Superman wouldn't be able to turn me into a good man. You would. You would make me more religious. When others pray five times a day, I'd pray seven times a day. I'd give donations weekly. So when Superman saw me, he'd be touched. He would see me, the villain, giving donations to orphans. Making a superhero movie into a religious one. YEAR 1946 - What are we doing here? - To thank our nation's heroes. I thought you wanted to be a Superman villain. That's right. But imagine if we're still under colonialism until today. I wouldn't get to meet you. I would be somewhere in the woods, fighting. I would come with you then. - How? - You could carry me! - You want me to carry you? - Yeah! That's what I call "Burden of patriotism." My mom is a teacher. She often took me and my sister here since we were little. Sometimes we would just read or buy books. "They'll make you smart," she said. This is her favorite shop. - Hi. How are you? - Great. Do you have Playboy magazine? What? Are you kidding me? No. You can't! No? Fine. Prayboy, then. - Playboy, you mean? - Prayboy! Do you have it? That kid's book. - That one! - Wait here. If I can't read Playboy, then Prayboy it is. I'm a good boy. These are some prayer books. Here they are. JUZ AMMA TRANSLATION We can go straight to heaven after we read these books. Amen. - Let's go. - Do you want these books? - No, I've memorized those. - Tickets to heaven, are you sure? Maybe later, she already memorized the prayers. I don't know about her spiritual side. But I know all about her physical side! Hey. Awesome! - Anyway, thanks. See you. - No problem. How about looking for a marriage handbook? BEWARE OF THE DOG'S OWNER! Bunda! My pretty girl! - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. - Where have you been? - Just riding around the town. Can you believe she said she wanted to have a billion kids? My goodness! How are you going to take care of them all? See? Have you eaten? Good. - We'll have lunch at Saribunda. - Awesome! Come in. The day before his scheduled circumcision, he ran away early in the morning. Everybody was looking for him. How did you find him? I had a feeling he was somewhere inside the house. Something told me that he's hiding under the bed. And I was right. So I called his father. Do you know what did his father said? What did he say? He said, "Let them do it under the bed. I hope they cut the whole thing off." You should be a girl. Girls don't get circumcised. - I was a girl once. Ask my mom. - That's just you acting weird! One day, Bi Diah came to me and said there was a girl praying at the musallah. I was curious. And you know what I found? I found him praying in a hijab. "It's cold," he said. - It was really cold, I swear. - Yeah, right. It was the happiest moment of my life. When you're deeply in love with each other... togetherness is the most important thing. But we're only humans after all... and there's no such thing as a perfect relationship. Dilan. Have you heard the news? Akew passed away. What? Some guys beat him to death and they're still on the loose. Akew passed away. I know. - Were you there with him? - No. When I heard the news, I knew you'd think I was involved. That's why I came here. - What? - Now you know what could happen to you. What? Can't you see? This is why I strictly forbid you to hang with your biker gang. - Do you understand my reasons now? - No, I don't. And I wasn't involved. But it's definitely about gang wars. - It's not. - It is! - I have to go back now. - We should go together to his funeral. - I'll go with my friends. - But I'm going there too. I don't care, I'm going with my friends. Dilan! I don't like you being a biker gang member. BOOKS ARE THE WINDOWS OF THE WORLD Nothing could change her negative opinion about biker gangs. She thinks it needs to be outlawed. I understood her anger and why she chose to ignore me when I needed her the most. It's just my luck. Even Maya rejected me. But I actually like Erni more. If Erni rejects you too, it means she copies Maya. That's not creative. Find a creative girl. Take Bi Eem for example. She's so creative. She can make vegetable fritters. You're crazy, man. By the way, will Erni reject me because of my bronchitis? Now we're talking about bronchitis? Bronchitis? Silly Akew. HENDRI WIJAYA MAY 17, 1972 - JULY 31, 1991 I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm so sorry for his passing, ma'am. My deepest condolences. Thank you, Dilan. I'll take you home. No, Nandan will drive us home. I really needed Lia's support back then.

Tell him what happened... about Akew. - I wasn't even there, I swear. - Tell that to your father. Yes, Mom. Are you done yet? Go eat your dinner. Poor Akew. There's nothing we can do. I guess it was his time. You're right. She's here. Lia. I'll take you home. Faris is picking me up. I'll see you around then. I told her I left the gang but she kept giving me the cold shoulder. I didn't know what else to do. I wanted my old Lia back. I guess I have to be patient, much more patient. We were both babies. Where were you when I was a baby? I wanted to protect you, but... But I was just a baby like you. Does anybody know about the investigation's progress? Akew's murder is still a mystery. Is it true that it is gang-related? My friend in the police department is still working on it. - But for how long? - Have a little patience. Shush! The police are coming. What should we do? Just stay cool. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. What can I do for you? - Can we come in? - Yes, of course. - We are looking for Burhan. - I'm Burhan. - Are you Burhan? - Yes. Please read the warrant. As you can read in the warrant, we need to find more evidence to solve Akew's murder case and his involvement in a biker gang. Thus, we're taking you to our station for questioning. - Right now, sir? - Yes. I'm going too. I'm also Akew's friend. Me too, sir. - All right, then. Let's go. - Let's go. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. Dad. - Look at me! - I'm sorry, Dad. - How many of them? - Who do you mean by "them"? - Kids you've arrested. Just these kids? - Yes, sir. - Who's the leader of your gang? - I am. No, I am, sir. - Where are you from? - I'm from Ciwastra. - Do you know who beat up your friend? - No, sir. We have interviewed three other kids found near the victim's body at the scene. Yet they can't identify the perpetrators because they wore face masks. I won't get in the way of your investigation because it's your authority. I am here for my son. But if the law found him guilty, punish him accordingly. Yes, sir. And you, don't come back home. - You heard me? - Yes, Dad. That's your punishment. I don't care where you're going to sleep. - Don't let them sleep here. - Yes, sir. Good evening. Are you okay? My mind was wandering off. I was thinking of the day where I could make my parents proud of me and make up for my mistakes to them. Lia. Lia. Let's break up. - But why? - Go figure out yourself. Lia! Lia. What? - I'll take you home. - Don't bother. I'm taking you home, Lia. I'm taking you home. Wait here. - Give me my keys. - Where are you going? I'll be right back. Lia. Breaking up with Lia was such a shock. I felt helpless, like all of my energy was drained. The decision was hers, it was all right. I just prayed for strength to go on. I was glad I wasn't the one to leave and be the cause of her disappointment. Are you sure it's over? She wanted to end it. - Why did she slap you in the face? - Let's not talk about it. Well, sorry to hear that but since you started dating her, you were drifting away from us. You've changed. - What are you talking about? - You're not the same Dilan we knew. The guys said she really got a hold on me. They said she thought she was more important than anything else. One week later, I was allowed to return home when it was proven that the perpetrators mistook Akew for someone else. His death didn't have anything to do with him being in a biker gang. Hello? Assalamu'alaykum. Wa'alaykumussalam. Is Lia home? She's not here. She's taking exam preparation courses. She's taking courses? That's right. She went with her friend, Gunar. - By his car? - No, by his scooter. Finding out from her maid that Lia had moved on with another guy named Gunar, I couldn't help but feel jealous. - Oh, I see, thanks. Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. I guess that's only normal. I felt like I was losing myself. I felt like I was left behind. Lan, why are you so quiet? - Are you still hungry? - No. He still can't get over his ex. Speaking of your ex... she wants to see you. I want to see her too. But tell her I've got a new girlfriend. - Tell her she's more beautiful. - Shut up. - Piyan. - Yes? - Is Dilan staying in your house? - He is. Did he tell you about us? He told me that he failed you. He did not. Tell him, he didn't fail me. He made me happy. I just don't want him to be in a biker gang. I'll tell him. I hate to see him ending up like Akew. - Tell him that. - I will. - What else did he say to you? - He said... What did he say? He said he's got a new girlfriend. Is the gig in Saparua still on tomorrow? Yeah, but I don't feel like going. Why? - Because you'll be there watching me play. - That's ridiculous. Isn't that the point of being a musician? Hello? Dilan, it's Lia. Hello? Do you have any idea how hard it is to talk to you lately? - Are you busy? - Me? Piyan said you've been busy practicing with your band. That's a lie. You're never home. And you're never around when I call. Is your mom okay with that? My mom is always okay with everything. Are you avoiding someone? Avoiding who? Me? I'm not avoiding you. Can we meet tomorrow?

Apud! What is it? - I miss Lia. - I thought you've moved on. I was supposed to be here with Lia, not you. She's got a new boyfriend, right? You're right. ♪ We used to be together ♪ ♪ And then when we realize ♪ ♪ That we need to say goodbye ♪ ♪ It's easy to forget all of this ♪ ♪ But please don't forget About each other ♪ ♪ It is easy to lose all of this ♪ Here we are. You're here. - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. Oh my. Thank you, sir. - How are things? - Great. - Who is this? - I'm Apud, ma'am. Come in, sit down. - How was the trip? - Thank goodness we're here. Just a bit stiff for sitting too long. Of course, it was a long trip. Your uncle is still attending an event in Kridosono Stadium. But he'll be home soon. I hope you don't mind waiting. It's okay. Mom and Dad send their regards to both of you. Thank you. Best regards from us too. I remember when your father was young. - He was so scary. - Like a tiger? Exactly, and your mother was the only one who could tame him. Now, please excuse me for a moment. I need to clean up your room and prepare your drinks. - I'll be right back. - Thank you. Dilan... Why don't you call Lia? If you miss her, tell her. There's no use telling me that. I thought taking you with me would make you her stunt double. You're nuts. That's Mr. Atmo. Sir! Hey, Dilan. - How are you? Let me help. - I'm fine, thank you. - How are you? - Thank God, I'm fine. - And your parents? - They're fine too. - Who is this? - I'm Apud, sir. - I'm Atmo. Please, sit down. - Okay. Mrs. Atmo is cleaning up our room and preparing our drinks inside. - Oh, really? Please excuse the mess. - Not at all. Well, do you have any plans for tonight? Um... All canceled. Dilan has lost interest. - What's wrong? - He's brokenhearted. Is it true that you're brokenhearted? He still can't get over her. - Who broke his heart? - His ex. And she's got a new boyfriend. Well then, there's no point in chasing after her. Don't let it get you down. - So, you lost a girl... - Thousands are still out there! But one is enough. Just one, Pud. Jogja has plenty of cute and sweet girls. Just pick the one you like. - Just like the food? - That is correct. That's what I call totality. You're home. Why are you only serving tea? I brewed strong tea though. - Drink your tea while it's warm. - Thank you. - Have you prepared the chicken? - Don't worry, they're ready to eat. I want to study here. - This is an art school, right? - Yeah. - I wish you luck then. - What are you wishing for? - I wish that you become a huge artist. - You mean a giant? Let's sit here. Look at that guy. Don't stare. He keeps holding his girlfriend's hand. He's afraid of losing her. - Don't laugh. - Why not? You have a cute laugh. I don't want him to like you. - I'm going to laugh to make him like me. - Go ahead. - Expect a duel between me and him. - Why? To fight over you. I'm rooting for you. - I should've come here with Lia. - But you said I'm her stunt double. The difference is huge, dude. What do you want for your present? I want to get married. What did you say? I want to marry an angel. Angel might be pretty, but she also has wings, you know. Do you want that kind of girl? How about 10 soft-boiled eggs for your gift? The best gift is whatever makes you happy. What is it? The best gift for me is for you to be happy. All right. I am happy, very happy. Thank you, Mom. - Where's Dad? - Hold on. Ical! - Yeah? - Dilan passed the admission exam. Really? - Like father, like son. - What? You inherited my intelligence. I beg your pardon! I mean, you inherited our intelligence. It's cold. It's okay. Thank you, Bi. I'm so happy you've all graduated and are now pursuing higher education. But somehow I feel sad too. Although some of you still need to pay off the debt for your meals. - You're talking about Ivan! - Are you afraid we won't pay you? It's not that. I can't imagine how empty my stall would be without you kids. Especially without Dilan and Lia. I remember the times when you would all hang out here, joking around, having fun. - Kiss me first. - Kiss you? Right here? - Of course not. Kiss me in your mind. - What do you mean? Imagine yourself kissing me. Let me know when you're done. Okay, you too. Done. - Where did you kiss me? - On your nose. How about you? Your lips. Let's do it again! I want to kiss your lips too. Later. You'll get the real kiss. Looking forward to it, commander. It would just be sad without all of you. So sad. But once in a while we'll be hanging out here again. I know, but it's not going to be the same. Please don't be sad. Trust me, it's not going to be the same. She's sad. Poor Bi Eem. Days come and go and the world keeps turning. We're living our own lives, with our own destinies. One day my dad had to be rushed to the hospital. And that night he looked nothing like the tough Dad I remember. The Indonesian soldier whom I love was lying weakly on his bed. I don't need all this stuff. - Don't pull the tubes, Dad. - Stop it, Dad. Call the nurse. Dad. Are you and Banar here by yourselves? Mom and Disa are here too. They're eating, outside. I want to lay my head on your lap, son. I felt powerless in the deafening silence. Dad? Disa has a boyfriend now. Where's Lia? She's here. - Bring her in. - I will, Dad. Dad? Bring her in. I will, Dad. Are you in pain, Dad? There is no deity but God. Even my dad missed Lia. He asked about her in between his last breaths. Where are you, Lia? I want to cry out loud on your shoulder. Ical! Dad! Ical! Ical. Ical. My father took his last breath that night. All the love and good memories were gushing out from my heart just like the tears from my eyes. I was trembling, overwhelmed by the memories I had with him. Farewell, Kostrad Lieutenant. Farewell, my hero. I wish we could be together forever. Present arms! I loved you and I had the greatest respect for you in this life and in my next life. Thank you for being the greatest dad. Thank you for being a good, loving husband to Mom. I would gladly be your witness on the Day of Judgment. The ceremony has been completed, all soldiers may leave the burial site. Family and relatives of the deceased may proceed to bid a final farewell. Dad, I hope you can hear me, because I want to tell you that I love you. Sir. My condolences. Wati. - Bunda. - Lia. I'm sorry I couldn't come to the ceremony earlier. Thank you, dear. I'm so sorry for your loss. Disa. ♪ And for me Bandung is not only... ♪ Our life has never been the same after the passing of my dad. We bought a house in Cibiru. It's a small house but big enough for us. ♪ That accompanies me when I'm alone ♪ ♪ There are other places ♪ ♪ That I've been before ♪ ♪ But my heart fully stays in Bandung ♪ My brother, Banar, got married and bought a house in Cimahi. Landin got married too and now lives in Bekasi, and Disa... She is studying in UNPAD. And me? - Anyways, are you from Bandung? - Yes. Which area? Buah Batu. Bandung? My fiancee went to high school in Bandung. Oh... From sophomore through senior year. I think her school was in Buah Batu too. Really? - Bandung is popular for its mild climate. - And their pretty women. How's Saritem? Great, I guess. Did you go there often? Everybody has their own hangouts. Exactly. Could you send me the report from Mr. Mustache to Mr. Dono in room 521? It's urgent, I don't want Mr. Dono leaving and missing the report. Dilan? I can't believe it. Lia. What are you doing here? - Are you working in this building? - I'm an intern. - Can you keep this for me? - Sure. - How are you? - I'm fine. What are you doing here? - Yeah, I was-- - Lia. Shall we go now? Didn't we talk in the cafeteria? - Mr. Dono's staff? - Yes. - I'm Herdi. - Dilan. I work in the Marketing Division. Oh... Shall we? - Later. - Okay. Bye, Dilan. Take care. Watching Lia left with Herdi made me realize that we would never be together. I prayed for her happiness. That's the least I could do. That day, Miss Rini, my favorite teacher passed away. - How are you, Lia? - I'm fine. Look, Lia's here. I should offer my condolences to her family. - Lia. - Lan. - How are you? - Fine. - How are you? - Good, thanks. Um, please excuse us. - Hello? - Assalamu'alaykum. Wa'alaykumussalam. Hey, Dilan. Lia? How did you get my number? Wati gave it to me when we were in Miss Rini's house. Ah... - How are you? - I don't know. I'll let you know when I do know. I'm so glad I got to see you there yesterday. - See? - See what? Me too. I'm glad we met again yesterday. I didn't know what to say to you. I don't know why. I was confused and upset. I don't even know why I was upset. - I-- - You what? I hate it every time I see a couple riding a bike. They reminded me of us. We spent so much time together on your bike. I remember. We rode around Buah Batu. Do you miss those times? I do. You were right. Carrying that burden is hard. Then let me carry it for you. You said that a lot too back then. I wonder how Bi Eem's doing now. I miss hanging out at her stall. I'm sure she's fine and kept busy by new customers. We were her customers. I know, we owned the place. How about your biker gang? It has been inactive for quite a while. And I'm no longer their leader. Is he as much fun as you are? I don't know about that. Does he like to approach a girl by reading their future too? Does he gift that girl a solved crossword puzzle book? Is he always ready to fight for the girl's honor? I hope so. Does he have a mother like your mom? Does he have a mother like your mom, Dilan? Not everything has to be an exact copy. I miss your mom. I'm sure she misses you, too. Why don't you go out on a date? It's Saturday night. I just got home. What if she tried to call you right now... and the phone is busy? She's already sleeping. I talked to her on the phone before you called. Hmm. So, you don't mind me calling you right now? Of course not. Why aren't you out on a date, too? He's in Kalimantan now. Can I ask you something, Lia? About what? - But please don't get mad at me. - What do you want to ask? Promise me first. Okay, I promise. Well, what's the question? Right after we broke up I heard you dated a guy from your courses named Gunar. Gunar? Do you know him? No, somebody told me about him. I didn't date him. We were just friends. And I think he had a girlfriend that time. I thought he was your new boyfriend. He wasn't, Dilan. Why not? - Why not what? - Why didn't you tell me about it? I thought you already got a new girlfriend. Tell her I've got a new girlfriend. - He said... - He said what? He said he got a new girlfriend. I was convinced you already had a new girlfriend. I thought the girl in your father's funeral was your girlfriend. - Risa? - I don't know her name. She's my cousin. Dilan. Are you going to come to our school reunion? REUNION CLASS OF 91-92 What's up, man? Lia. How are you, Piyan? Look, there he is! What's up? - Bowo. - Hey. - You're getting tougher. - How are you? Piyan. Rani. Mr. President. Hi. - I'm Dilan. - Milea. Do you need to introduce yourself again? Just in case she forgets about me. - Sit here, Lan. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hello. - Well? - Now what? Should we burn the school down? - I remember when you said that. - I'm not that kid anymore. All right. Since everybody's here and we don't have much time left let's start our reunion. Why don't we start with Dilan? Does everybody agree? Yeah! - Dilan! - Why me? Dilan. - Assalamu'alaykum. - Wa'alaykumussalam. I'd like to thank all of you for sparing your time for this reunion in our beloved school. Although I didn't last until my senior year due to having too much fun back then, but I've got many good memories from this school that I cannot forget. I'm so happy I get to see you, my old friends from high school. So let's have fun. I wish you all happiness. But let's start this reunion with a moment of silence in memory of the late Miss Rini and our friend Akew. - Adit will lead the prayer. - Huh? - Why me? - Why not? I'll do it. In the name of God, the merciful and benevolent. All right, friends, let's pray for the late Miss Rini and Akew. - Goodbye, Dilan. - Are you going straight back to Jakarta? Yeah. - Take care. - Okay. Give my best regards to your girlfriend. Sure. I missed you. I missed you, too. - Big hug to your mom. - Sure. - Say hi to Disa. - Okay. - And everybody else. - Okay. He's waiting. I'd be lying if I tell you there's no regret. But it's okay for me to fail in a relationship. However, all days that we spent together were the best days of my life. ♪ When the night arrives ♪ ♪ The dark sky is covering the Earth ♪ ♪ I worry about you ♪ I was so lucky to get to know her, Milea Adnan Hussain. Hi, Lia. Lia, wherever you are... thank you for the time you've spent with me through thick and thin. Every moment was a blessing and every memory is worth keeping. We promised to be together forever. I was so sure we'd always be together when we were laughing on my bike with the wind in your hair on the way to school or just riding around Bandung, which you loved so much. It never crossed my mind that I'd break up with you. But we did it anyway. Lia, wherever you are, that's the reality. We should stay strong, as strong as life itself, full of love and understanding. Although we failed and our hearts broke, it doesn't mean that we lost. - What are your future goals? - To become a pilot. How about you? I want to marry you. - Will you marry me? - Yes! Thank you, Lia. Milea Adnan Hussain. I will always keep you in my memories, where you belong.
