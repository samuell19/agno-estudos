You have to pay for your father's debt. Good. "Bear Missiles". Simple tricks. You can't scare me. So careless? It's just the beginning. Wait a moment. Miss. Miss, what's up with you?

But I haven't seen you before. She's called Moon? Are you really her friend? You even don't know her name. Moon is a regular here. She's so pitiful. She had a fever when she's a kid. Her eyes got damaged. But it's not the end. She had bone cancer when she's 12. She's okay after 3 years of treatment. But it's still not the end of it. Today, she's gonna have cornea replacement surgery. But she's got hurt in such a way. That son of the bitch. He hurt her at this time. He's so heartless. Is she seriously? Come. She's had brain scan. She's not very serious. She's shocked. I want her to take two-day rest. Take some Anti Biotic Qallisun. If she can't sleep well, take Volume Two. No need to worry. Thank you. We can't take it. Don't worry, you take care of her. Where is it? Anyone here? Don't be scared, it's the hospital. Hospital? I need a cornea replacement surgery. Call Dr. Cheung. It's damaged. I don't know if I can get it. Who pushed me in fact? Is that you? No. Not me. That guy ran away once he's pushed you. I'm just a passer-by. I sent you to the hospital. Thank you. I'm so unlucky. I can't take revenge. He just ran away. I didn't scold him. Okay, do you remember what he looks like? Yes, I'll beat him if I see him again. I'll tell him to roll downstairs 100 times. Sir, please call Dr Cheung. Okay. Thanks. What's your name? My name is Ko Hing. It's a good name. I'm Moon, thank you. Never mind. Awake. Doctor, I've waited you for a long time.

And spliced into 2 factions in Ming dynasty One is "Plot and Setup Faction" Another one is "Straightforward Faction" Although we just wanna make fun. We don't hurt anybody, it's our ethics We've done two marvellous jobs. One is made the Plsa Tower tilted. And we made joke with Superman, this scumbag To wear his underwear at the front. Lau Ka Lin is the master of the "Plot and Setup Faction" Their principle is contradictory to ours. They use wicked means to achieve their arms They hurt the innocent usually. It's simple, let's get Lau. He is very cunning, where can we get him? Agreed. So, I'm gonna tell you at this time. I've got important clues. I have found a memo in a shell. Look! It's their sign! Do you know this paper... is called horse stool grass paper. It's made of horse stool grass. Now, there's only country still making this paper. It's Malaysia. In HK, there's only one shop selling that. It's in Temple Street. I've been there. The boss told me, no one bought it since 10 years ago. No other clues then! I've said it's not that easy to find him. Wrong. I won't give up. I know he will appear at 8 o'clock tonight. How do you know? It's because it's mentioned on the memo. Well done. Tonight 9:00. 9:00? It's 8:00p.m. 9:00p.m., yes... Sorry, I need recording TV programme at 8:00pm. But there're other words. I can't read them. Look... Do you know them? I'm feeling well. Those are ancient words. It says: Plot and Setup, Without Remorse. He said he will come at 9:00p.m., we have to get ready. Do we need weapons? No! We just need to adopt "Waiting and Cleaning Method". What does it mean? Listen, We needn't do anything, just wait for him to come. Be careful! Tricky King, how do you do? What's up, Tricky Emperor? You're so childish, although you stay at home, my plot can't hurt you, I can still hurt your best love. Oh... My suits have got cut. Look at this. Chevigon is cut into Chevi, no "ON" at all. Look at this, all of them have been cut. Now they seem to be bought from hawkers. I spent more than 10 grands on it! Why? Little mosaic were drawn on my nude girls' photos. Who did it? I have lost all my spiritual food. I can't see the important parts now. You're so cunning. Thank you. But I don't like nude girls and expensive suits. What can you do to me?

It became serious when the firemen came. What does it look like? Has it finished? Gas explosion was heard at the scene. The fire department thinks it worth's suspecting. The police are still investigating it. I forgot to turn off the gas today. What do you think? We have lost all our things. We've lost our family. Listen, If you don't mind, you can move to my place.

I think it's really problematic. Now the main gate was shut down. We'll be in danger. They are girls. It's not good if they touch them accidentally. If both girls plot with Lau Ka Lin, We'll die. It's possible. It's simple, from today, you and I take shift, stay here. Sure? Be careful. What's the next step? I'm gonna guard the ceiling. I guard the ground. Who... Don't scare... I'm here. Me.

Yes, I just wanna give you a surprise, but you get up so early. Is it good? Look, thank you. I think I should give you fresh flowers. But I'm very poor now. Take it. Do you like fresh flowers? Yes, I used to buy fresh flowers with my cousin. Cheap and pretty. We go at this time. But my cousin is a lazy bone. I just wanna someone go buying flowers with me. Yes, your cousin is a lazy bone. Otherwise, you have a girl go with you. Forget it, you take a nap. Fine. Pretty flowers. Pretty? Smell good? You're a good guy. You come with me. I can't sleep instead. Smell good? It is the nicest place in my mind. You're a good guy. I take you to a bath. Bath? I don't think so. No, do you smell good after brushing with soap? You can do this here. Come. Carnation, Red Palm. Can you see it? I use my nose. It's better than your eyes. Ko Hing... Smell good? Does it smell good? Is it better than taking a bath? Smell me, do I smell good? Do I smell good? Smell good? Good. It smells as good as after a bath. What's up? I haven't smell you yet. Why do you stink? Stink bean curd. No one sells stink bean curd so early. What's up? Is it illegal to do so? Do you wanna buy? Or else get lost. Don't block my way. Let's eat bean curds as breakfast. My bean curds do not stink. You look ugly, so I give you the one that doesn't stink. Say it again! Forget it, eat mine, it stinks. Go, go, go... You should give him a lesson. Forget it, there must be a reason that he sells so early. Maybe he needs to do it for his family. Are you happy every day? Bro, I nearly die, you know. I'm blind, I won't mind with the things that I can't see. Try to considerate. Then you'll be happier. I know sometimes we can't control ourselves. I cried for my lost cornea yesterday. But it's okay, I can wait. I know I'll get it one day. What's up? Ko Hing? What's up? We're tricked, we've lost four wheels. That's great, we can go back on foot. On foot? Youngsters should do more exercises. Let's go. What is your occupation? I... trick the others. You're a toy-maker. I make toys which trick the others.

I don't believe you will stay there forever! What're you looking at? Nothing special. We're watching 3-D graphics. But I don't know why I can't see anything. You're blind. So you see nothing. I'm specialist. Let me teach you. - You can? - Sure. We don't know what we're looking at. You look further. Then narrow your sight. - Then. - Then. Put your head here. It seems to be a bathroom.

The bathtub is over there. This is the toilet. Yes. Shampoo is over there. Right. I've tricked Ko Hing. I've torn out his wheels. Now his car has no wheels. He lost money after his car has just been insured. He'll be scared. What's up with you? I pay you so much but you just give me some wheels! You've to trick him with shit or urine. Or push him into shit pit when he's shitting. I think you can do so on your own. I hate people look upon me. If you wanna play with shit, go to find "Wong Jing". I want the people tricked by me remember me forever. I will tear out the hair of an almost bald man. I will tear them out one by one, without prior notice. I want Ko Hing to be afraid all the time. He can't live or die neither. - What's up? - Are you scared? What's up? I wanna knit clothes for you, so I want to measure your shoulders. Knit clothes for me? Yes. You went buying flowers with me yesterday. I have nothing to do indeed. It's a good gift. Thank you. I don't like owing the others anything. One time, a bad guy knew my temper, and he went with me. But he just wanted my clothes. A clothes worth much money. It worthy a grand. He's so bad. But I'm not that weak, I scolded him for a year. You've got good memory. You scolded for a year.

I can't go to have fun instead. I'm not going to have haircut. Where do you wanna go? You don't want a haircut? You're really my best friend. I'll knit you underpants. It's meaningful to wear when it's cold. Let me see whether you wear the triangular or not. I don't wear underpants. I'm blind, it's lucky. It's not good to see such thing in the morning. Do you go? I'm waiting for you. Where do you want to go? Let me think. You have thought for half day already. Concert? Too boring. I see, I wanna play what I haven't play before. It's exciting. I haven't thought that driving is so exciting. But it's windy. How about my hair? Not messy, looks great. You may be tired. No, I'm very happy, not tired. I heard some sound. Where does it come from? That's the great place for lovers in Tsim Sha Tsui. You always take your girl here. I have no girlfriend. You have no girlfriend? Really? You must be a bad-looking guy. Yes, I am, I am very ugly. But you have a nice name. Is my name nice? Yes, don't you think so? Sir, what's your name? I'm called Ko Hing, K-O Ko, H-N-G Hing. I like simple name. It makes me happy. But my name is bad. I'm called Mui. It means bad luck. You can change it. It's fate. Don't think it's bad. We're blind. Getting unlucky, so I'm called Mui. But you're very happy today. Change your name to "Happy". Happy? That's great. Forget it. I'm happy when I'm with you. I'll have fun with you in the future. I call you "Happy" when I'm with you. Take it seriously. What do you mean? Want me to be your girl? I'm not an easy girl. How can you be my girl? Unless you give me your eyeball. What a big eyeball! Give me. I can exchange it with my virginity. Virginity is valueless now. Nonsense, second-handed one is valueless. I'm brand new, I'm expensive. Can I have a check? Get lost, you sex mania. Can you lower the price? No, I won't. Don't run that fast, be careful. "Remote-controlled banner skin", be careful. What's up? Don't move. What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up? Ko Hing. Ko Hing, where're you? Don't go. Mui... You're not trustworthy. What did I step on? Why is it here? You've stepped on a banana skin. Someone is so indecent. Water! Water! It's funny... It's round. It's not flat. Two points on them. Miss, you seem open minded. don't think it's indecent. What? Really? You've made much progress. You can see round things. Lin. What's up? I wanna tell you, you treat me well. I don't know what I can do to pay you back. Be honest, it's not only my contribution. Lau Huet treats you well too. Don't talk about Lau Huet. - Why? - He's an asshole! You come closer when he's not here. I wanna tell you something. What? Lau Huet is a sex mania. Don't think he's a good guy? Stupid, do you know? He's not that type. Don't trust him. He's a bad guy in fact, do you know? Bat Chi. What are you doing? You're back. We're talking about you when you come back. What? What's up? Have you bought it? Yes, look. That's great. All of them inside the box. What have you bought? We've told someone to buy you some good things. Yes, have a look. The is the "Special Item for the Blind to See Again". That things are for the blind to see again. I needn't use it, I've almost recovered. - I just need Lin. - Stupid fool, you're stubborn. It enables you to try harder when you're nearly cured. I don't need them, really. What's up? Have you bought it? We're as close as brothers. I have to cure your eyes. I can't let you feel hurt anymore, do you know? What do you wanna do? Why do you tie me up? You'll feel hurt in the curing procedures. We tie you up because we're afraid you can't tolerate it. Doctors told me I'm a good blind person. You needn't help. Needn't... You've bought it, have a try. Have a try, she's encouraging you to do so. Have a try, come on... ready... Cone on, start! What's up? Why do you take out a long needle? Can you see it? No. I just feel the coldness which comes out from the sharp blade. It's being thrusted into my heart! Don't... Keep silent... Why do I hurt you? It's for helping you. You? It's used for the "See Again Candy". What? "See Again Candy"... This is sour candy to make the blind see again. This is made from 490 lemons and 2596 pickled fruits and 20 gallons of acid. The is the essence of the things noted above. So it's the sourest thing in the world. Don't touch it. Don't smell it. Come on, open your mouth. No, I won't. - Open. - Eat it, it's good for you. Eat it. Look at him, he feels very comfortable. It means it's good to him. Let's start the second stage. What's up? What's up? The is the "Ultimate Flash". It can produce strong light of high degree. It makes damaged iris work again. Lin, stay back, don't see. Stay behind me, don't see. This is because this flash does harm to normal iris. Please let me go. No more this. What's up? Do it to him, not her! He's closed his eyes. Open your eyes. You'll know it's powerful. Wait a moment. It's useless to treat this guy with a baseball bat. Use a toothpick. What do you see? I see a wild beast with human face. It's showing its teeth and palms. Great! Very good. It's good to have fantasies. Do you think the flash is not strong enough? Yes, you're right. I've been ready for it. Any bigger? Lin, it's dangerous here, stay away. Lin, not that way, it's this way, come here. He's screaming! So pitiful! Bat Chi! Lin, don't go there. You have to pay for recovery. Don't be kind in this important situation. We just need to bless him. Wish him recover as soon as possible. Yes, I think so too. You didn't sleep? I've slept. But you woke me up. You open your eyes when you're sleeping? It's impossible. We played together since we're kids. I admire you. You're smart and handsome. A lot of babes like you. Don't say that. You're quite good. A lot of men like you. Be honest, it's precious to meet a lovely girl whom I love most. Will you come to my wedding banquet? Asshole, stop it. I won't give you face when we're talking about Lin. Don't scramble her with me. Lin said she loved me. Lin said she loved me. Leave you alone. Get down, I won't sleep with you, get lost. Get lost! Fine. I though you're my bro. Think about it. I'll leave you alone. Asshole. Why did you slam the door? Are you angry? Stop the car. Didn't you fall asleep? No. I'm thinking what I haven't played before. I know, I haven't watched the sunrise. It's difficult, Happy. It's 5 o'clock. The sun is gonna rise. Okay. We're here. So quick? Yes, it's great to watch a sunrise here. Really? Has it come out? Can we see it? Does it look good? Where? Where? Be careful! What's up? A cliff over there. Don't move. You'll fall down. I'm afraid of heights. Where're you? Where? I'm here. I'm afraid of heights. It's high. It's lucky that you can't see it. Really? You needn't be afraid. I'm here. as the sun risen? Look. What's up?

Your description is fantastic. Just like I was watching it. But I don't know why the sunrise stinks? It's not the sunrise business. I've farted, sorry. Forget it. It's a good opportunity to watch a sunrise which stinks. End. Let's go back. Get on the car. Ko Hing, thank you. What are you calling? It's dark. Thank you, why no echo? - Try again. - Get on the car. - Ko Hing... - Don't cry, go. We need sleep, disgusting. Why are there so many people living in the Peak? They stay here overnight for the sunrise. No echo here. It's not the Peak. Why deceived me? I hate it! Leave me alone. Why did you deceived me? Sorry. I... Forget it, you just want to make me happy. Deserve forgiveness. No more. Go back, I'm tired. I haven't been so happy for a long time. I'm happy too. I haven't been so happy for a long time. I have waited you for half a day. I'm gonna get you. It's dark No more screaming! Go to the Peak! Have breakfast. Breakfast. What do you wanna to? Let go of me. I saw this fried oily stick first. Nonsense, I saw it first. There are much food on the table, choose the others. I only want this oily stick. Stop it. You know I like fried oily stick. I saw it first, I'm telling you. I saw it first. Why do both of you want fried oily stick? It's simple. Get a half. Okay? It's separated. He's touched it. I don't want it. What do you mean? Are you showing your personify? Why? I don't want it. Sit down. Do you still remember my instructions? We belong to the "Straight Forward Fraction". We can't me moved by anything. Look at yourselves. You argued over a fried oily stick.
