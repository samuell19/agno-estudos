- Goodnight, Patti. - Good morning. Oh, got the keys? Come on, Benny. I'm tired. I wanna get home. How about that? I wonder how many push-ups she does every morning. - That's all you think about. - '12 shillings, this magazine.' 'Bloody cheats.' 'Wish I had a paper.' You think he's got something to eat. I don't know. Have a look. I must have something. I've only had a bag of chips since yesterday afternoon. Here's Benny now. He can tell you. - He's picked up a girl. - That's a pretty bird. Well, I'd give her one. What are you doing? Please leave this place as you'd expect to find it. 'Vic.' 'Vic.' - The light's on. - Good morning. - What's the game? - In there. Don't you stand there, girl. Come in. Why don't you go make a cup of tea? Hello, Benny. Look, Vic. Vic.. Oh! Pick him up. Pick him up. Oh! Oh! Benny...Benny, you've been talking too much. This will help you to get the chow down quicker. Please. Careful, Vic. Bleeding pigeons. Hi, there, mom. - Bought you a nice cup of tea. - Thank you. - Good sleep? - Yeah. Must've done. - What time is it? - It's half past eight. Hmm. You're up early. Yeah. I had a night out with the boys. Looks like it's gonna be a nice day. Might go for a room near the coast. - Get a breath of sea air. - Brighton? - Well, I guess. - Oh, I'd enjoy it. Drink your lemon tea while it's hot. Morning. Hello, Tom. Ha ha ha. How's my favorite girl at, eh? She never hugs me like that. I think she saves them for you. Her Uncle Tom's her favorite. Isn't he? Aren't I your favorite, eh? Oh, lovely new dress. It's lovely, that. You've come to help me with the gardening? Benny Thompson got done last night. - Is he dead? - No, poor lad. They cut him. Here and here, and most other places. - Uh...Jill, love. - Yes? Ask mummy to make us a cup of coffee, will you? - Thank you, darling. - And some biscuits. Yeah, they strung him up like a bleeding cock. As in hung him from a window, five stories up. Benny Thompson. He didn't give us much, did he? No, nothing special. Just gossip. - Smells like Vic Dakin to me. - Can't think why he bothered. I better come in. Oh, you're alright. I just dropped by. Anything to stop bloody gardening. Good morning, Vic. See the match? How terrible. They shouldn't have taken it out. Should they? He's looking well. Where've you been, Tommy? South of France? He's playing very well, eh? - Weller. - Yeah. God, give him a drink. Cheer him up with it. Yeah. How is Mrs. Dakin these days? She's well. Thank you. Very nice of you to ask. - Give him a drink. - Yeah, sure. Morning, Vic. How you been? How's mum? Goodnight on the box tonight. Donald O' Connor and Vera-Ellen. What's the score then, Danny? Bit of aggravation at the club. 'Well, Danny's got a bit of business.' Oh, yes? Well, it's not quite your line, Vic, but, uh, bit of money. - How much money? - Sixty or seventy thousand. Here you are, boys. - I'm listening. - A plastic factory. Huge place, big payroll. No armored van. Mm-hmm. Well, I know a guy, see? He works in the wages department. 'Sees the money being delivered every week while he's there.' Why's he telling you about it? Well, he comes down to the club, you see. You know the type. Pathetic. 'Comes down to the club most Saturdays.' Tells his wife he's seeing football. - That makes him bent. - No, no. He's screwed up by one of the broads there. Well, he only wants to take care of her. You know what I mean. Well, he's a bit mental for start. Bitter, you know, thinks the world owes him something. A weirdo. Worth a paid perk. Sounds a bit tasty. Nice of you to think of us, Danny. I will think. - I'll see you. - Oh, yes. Well, cheers, Vic. Anytime, you know. Yes. Yes. Uh, no need to collect off Danny for a couple of weeks. Reward initiative. Well, I don't know. It's not our sort of, well, I mean it's not your sort.. Well, what I mean is a bit of robbery these days.. Well, I mean...you can't tell. We're being very erudite today, aren't we? Bit of blazing eloquence there. Give me the keys. I'll take mum for a run. See if you can find Wolfe. I wanna talk to him. I wanna see what he's up to. It's just a favor, love. Yes, well, I don't like some of your favors. Look, we'll take a nice drive in the country, right? Fresh air, posh house, lovely way to spend a Sunday. And who's going to be there? Some friends of mine. You've just got to be nice to them. You know it's important to me, love. And you'll meet a nice type of person. Generous as well. He's got his own plane. Land in the back garden, goes to Scotland, shoots his own deer. Yes, it has a certain style about it. Some place though, isn't it? Fit for a king. The baths are undoubtedly freezing. The rich don't need bathrooms. Wolfe, I'm so glad you could come. How terrific. Hello, Vivian. This is Venetia. - Hello, Venetia. - Hello. Look, we're all drinking in here, so come on through. I do wish you'd been down here last night. Some lovely faces came down. Anyway, please circulate. I'll organize some champagne for you. And do help yourself to what you want. Fine. - Who is she? - Sshh. Cut it out. He's only a marquis, isn't he. Influencing friends and making people. - Thank you, squires. - Oh, thank you. Cheers. - I know his face, don't I? - Should do. You've seen it often enough on the telly. Stirring the conscience of the nation. He's an MP. 'I wouldn't vote him member of parliament.' 'It's not your vote he's after.' Hello, Wolfe. Venetia, this is Gerald Draycott. - Hello, Venetia. - Hello. 'Vivian tells me you're not staying, Wolfe.' What do you mean you're not staying? I've got to get back. Got things to do. I'll take your car, okay? Someone will give you a lift back in the morning. Yes. I'm going back myself. Got things to do, pet. - You are a louse, Wolfe. - What can I do? What a shame. Still, I hope you might enter into the spirit of things, Venetia. Hmm? Hello, boy. - Hello, Wolfe. - Hello, Ken. Did your friends find you? Friends? What friends? Yes, two of them asking for you about, about an hour ago. Hey. You're just gonna take him for a walk? I'm going down to The Potter for a drink. Bring him upstairs. I've got something for him. Okay. Come on. Terry. Duncan. Sshh, boy. Sshh. Well, what's the scene? Vic's missed you, Wolfe. He wants to see you. Just friendly like. He's very fond of you, Wolfe. Well, how's his mum? Is she okay? Alright. Mustn't grumble, Wolfie boy. Gettin' old. You know what I mean? He wants to see you. Well, I'll give him a call, alright? Right. What's your name? Kenneth. That's a nice dog you got there, Ken. A friend of mine had one like it. He got run over. A few times. What was all that about then? Nothing to worry about. Just couple of friends I met. Come on. I'll give you that meat, eh? Okay. I'm back. You might have put the kettle on. What do you want? Cheddar cheese or ham? - Uh.. - I told you to stay at home. You could've been still in your garden. I was going to do it last week, but it poured. The girl didn't say anything, sir. Well, you're a very lucky lad, constable. No, sir. I mean Benny Thompson's girlfriend, sir. She said she came home and found him there. What, at six o'clock in the morning? What about Thompson? He's still on the critical list. Oh, he'll live, just. But he'll live. Alright, Len, thanks. Would Dakin be there himself? Be there himself? He'd have done it himself. He'd have enjoyed it. Doesn't give a damn, you know. Helps him to relax. Do you know what he does on a Sunday, Tom? If it's fine, he takes his mum down to Brighton walks around the seafront, up the pier buys a plate of whelks, then drives home at 30 miles an hour so she doesn't get hiccups. He can't be all bad then, can he? - I brought you some Earl tea. - Yes, thank you, dear. - I didn't want the biscuits. - Oh, sure you did. Well, I'm off to bed. It's been a long day. - I did enjoy it. - Yes, so did I, so did I. Well, God bless. - Goodnight. God bless, son. - Goodnight, sweetheart. How are you, Danny? Nice weekend? I gotta pack this in, Mr. Matthews. Benny Thompson. Oh, Benny. Benny was flashy. He bragged a bit too much. Not like you, Danny. - You use a bit of common sense. - Not funny, is it though? Occupational hazard, isn't it? - Pardon? - You're a stoolie, Danny. 'And informers don't pack it in.' I've got these off, haven't I? Or I'll never last the distance. I'll tell you, if I can get a good year at the club I'd chuck everything in. Sell it. Go abroad in the sun. Spain. Will that do much good? What's Dakin doing? 'Apart from carving up croquettes.' I don't know, do I? When do I see Dakin? - You pay him protection money. - 'He's crazy.' He's a psychopath. A few years ago, when he was small-town, just a bouncer down at the clubs, do you know what he'd done? 'He tied this pimp to a lamppost and cut off--' Yes, I know. You're going to need...money. For Spain, Danny. - Hello, how was he? - Quiet. They'll all be shit scared for a couple of weeks. Oh, he did recommend SilverMine the 3:30 at Sandown. Oh, come on. He must be joking. Diabolical, this traffic. See that mad bugger? Go on, get out of here. 'That's the bank.' Got a hard on, have you? Bloody drive. Time us to the factory. Just want a rough idea. Then we'll time them out and when they next pick up. 'There it is.' Pull up at that phone box. Go and make a phone call, Terry. Who to? Your fairy-sodding-godmother. I don't know. Go and make a phone call. My godmother? So it appears that we three are loitering here with intent to commit a telephone call. - Fancy living here. - Oh, nice and quiet. Stupid punters. Telly all the week, screw the wife on Saturday. 'What do you reckon, Vic?' Looks sweet enough. - Out of order. - Hooligans. Lot to find out. What cars, how many people, what day how they carry the greens. That geese in the wages department I'd like to have a chat with him. I'm a clerk and a clerk, Mr. Bellamy, is nothing now. Of course, before the war, he was important. He gave the orders. He could rise to 400 a year. A modest sedan by the time he was 40. Your working man stayed at 3 quid a week. Not now. My wife knows it. She said to our kids, "You won't be a failure like your father." Sounds a right cow. - We need lots of details. - Yes, of course. Forty six and married to work. I'm human. I want a bit of love, see? Not content. Girls. Things I've missed. - I found one though. Nice girl. - Good. Good. We'll get you some money, you can buy some nice things. Well, who cares about the firm? They turn over millions. Don't think I'll talk, Mr. Bellamy. You'll get the wind up and go to the law. If they get it, I'll enjoy every minute of it. Could you draw us a diagram of where the wages department is? Yes, of course, of course. I've worked there 17 years. Filling in silly little forms and pink carbon copies. I want to know all about cars and pickups and people. Varies. You've got four weeks to do it. Why? They're waiting delivery of an armored van. 'They'll have it then.' Oh. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. And goodnight, gentlemen. Alright, here we go again. Thank you, Wolfe, for the weekend. She was marvelous when she got started-- Spare me the organ recital. - What? - Spare me the organ recital. Now, that's very nice. That is nice. - Do you know her? - By sight. How do I meet her? Ask for it, but piss off, will you? Thompson just worked here. I was his employer, not his guardian. You'd have known something about your employee's personal lives. No reason to. As long as they have no criminal records. As long as they're courteous, honest, and well groomed. We take great care with the type of clientele we have here. And what type is that? Distinguished. Hmm. Like the well known East End sporting personality. Mr. Dakin never gambles actually. He comes here for our excellent restaurant. And to collect the insurance. - I don't quite follow you. - Bulls, Mr. Barzun. Frank, my handsome. How are you? Fine, Vic. You're looking fit. Oh, feel fine. Feel fine. You know Ed Lowis. Yes. - How was Mr. Barzun? - His usual well-groomed self. - Dakin's here, you know. - Yes. I saw him. - Get him the big hello. - You know who he's with? Frank Fletcher and this other fellow. Lowis, isn't it? Hmm. Summit conference. I'll just have a couple of poached eggs. Poached eggs? Poached eg.. What're you doing with poached eggs? They got one of the best French menus. Can't help it. I've got this ulcer. Needs food every two hours. Comes from worrying, eh, Ed. Frank, reason why I called you we got a bit of business, but it's in your manor. 'I thought it'd be nice to let you know.' Nice business? Well, a big payroll. Be good drinkin' it for you. How much you think you'll take, Vic? Well, let's say 60-70,000. Hmm. It's quite a take. Well, since it's in my manor, how about putting my boys on it? Well, I don't know your boys, do I? I mean, I got my own boys. 'I got my own people to look after, Frank.' Frank has a reliable firm too, you know, Vic. That's not the point. I don't know them, do I? You know me, Vic. And Ed. I know he's your brother-in-law. I guarantee Eddie. Alright. Tell you what I'll do I'll take two boys.. ...you two. Us? Come on, Vic, come on. We don't crap on our own hands. Frank, we're doing alright, aren't we? We're both kings of our castles, aren't we? You got that little semi out in Epsom but you won't keep it if you sit in front of the telly.. ...delegating. 'If it is big enough and good enough' you'd do it yourself. 'Cause you know why 'cause nobody else can do it better. - Thank you, my son. - There are some cops here. That's important filth, that's regional crime squad. Well, worried about being seen in bad company? No. But I know what it means. You know what the word is, Vic? They say Matthews has just got the one piece of work. He doesn't have to bother with prostitution or dope. He's just got the one job. You. Take it easy, Edgar. It might perforate your ulcer. Hello, Vicky. What you doing? Playing with yourself. Excuse me. What are you so nervous about? Got a hangover from your last kinky weekend, have you? Please.. Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic, that's what you are. Pathetic. Get out of here. So what's he doing here? He's an MP, isn't he? I mean, the whole country looks up to him, right? So what's he doing here? Gambling, whoring, boozing. Can't even wash his hands when he goes to the bowl. Makes you think, doesn't it? Why did your firm cut up Benny Thompson? Who is he? I don't know what you're hoping to achieve except perhaps an orgasm. Don't be a burke all your life. Take a day off, sergeant. Inspector. Oh, it's come through, has it? That's nice. Bit more on your widow's pension. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Bob - See you in the morning. - Righto. Oh, come on. Bob. I met our son downstairs. I left you a sandwich. Brian's just come back. Do you know it's 3 o'clock in the morning? I'm fast asleep. I'm just trying to tell you our son's been out half the night. And who the hell is Brenda? His girlfriend. 'Mommy.' Oh. 'Mommy.' Alright. I'm coming. The whole household is awake. 'Mommy.' What's the matter? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hi, Wolfe. I ain't seen you for a bit. Know what I lost a bit tonight, Joe. Think you can help me? Are you, uh, carrying? Two thousand red ones in the car. - Right. Well, fetch it, man. - Yeah? Some of the kids are feeling a bit brittle, know what I mean? Come on, Wolfie. No messing around. Terry. - Duncan. - In the front. - See you later, Joe. - 'Yeah.' Close the door, Wolfie. I was gonna call, Vic. But, uh.. I, uh.. ...I lost a bit of money. Had to do a bit of dealing. Back to that, are you? It's a bit sordid. No ties, Vic. What did I do? Keep you in a lead? I used to give you hundred a week. - Flash car, good clothes. - I know. You didn't have to push paupers at four in the morning to small timers, did you? Did you? No. Bit sordid. The boys told me you asked about mum. Very nice of you. Nice of you, Wolfie. No more hustling. Sordid. Not too much noise. Unh! I'll take you up to town tomorrow. And get you some good suits. How's it going? Very nice. Thank you. 'This is Clarks. This is the factory.' 'Now, here we go then.' 'That's them.' 'Frank's car following from the back overtakes them.' By the time they get there Lowis comes along here. Boxed in. We come up here. Boxed in and buggered. What is it? Toys, Vic. Just toys. What is it, Frank? What's the matter? I got to say it, we got doubts. Feelings. We've seen the turf. I know it looks like a walk-in, but.. But what? It's not our game, it is, Vic? Robbery is not our way. People like the Jock and Billy Feather that's their game. Armed robbery Even Billy's got clobbered. Fifteen years. Tragic. Two lovely kids he's got. And old Tom's got your mark, Vic. Like a bleedin' hor-- I was talking to Frank, wasn't I? Look, Vic, I just don't want to be reckless. Frank. Frank. We're the boys, aren't we? Aren't we the boys? Always have been. Ever since we were kids. Hardly got off our mother's tit when we had 'em quaking down in Hackney. Should've seen him go. Set him alive, didn't you, my son? Be your age, Vic. We were kids then. Got away with blue murder. Got away with it. That's the point, Frank. Always did, Always have. Knew how to do it. Took care. But now we gotta take even more care. We got to. We got homes, we got families to think of, dependents, Frank. So we can't afford to be reckless like a bunch of bleedin' billiard old cowboys. We're the governors, Frank. Aren't we the governors? Terry, get the lads a drink. We'll all have a drink. Come on, Edgar. You can have a whiskey in your milk. I can't think of that. Well, never mind about that. Webb. Now, tomorrow is Wednesday. Hey, Wolfe. Wolfe. Can I have word? Come on. Just want a word, you know. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. What's all the... what's the problem about? What's all the rough stuff about? - Alright. - What's the rough stuff for? What's the matter? Do you bruise easy? What you lookin' for? What're you gonna find? Never know till we look. C'mon, that's not my game. I'm not a dream merchant. No, we know what your game is. You get people anything. Young boys, call girls, whippings, professional virgins. Look, can you-- How do you smoke these things? I'm a nice Jewish boy, alright. A nice Jewish peasant boy. There is not much delinquency among the Jews 'cause of the family life. We survive, that's all. Oh, you survive. That's what you're good at. in and out without getting your feet wet.. ...up until now. What's wrong with now? You're a very good friend... ..of Dakin's. Dangerous. Pack it in before it's too late. Do you self a favor. Or do you want, is that it? You might be in a position to, you might... ..be able to tell us something. You know where we live. You can't be serious, sir. I could get shot just talking to you. That's a great way to survive, that is. Can I go now? - What about this? - Oh, yeah. He hasn't a chance. Here you are, son. Pikey here will never stay the course. Hello. - Well, what's the matter? - Tell him what's the matter. They're already goin' on strike, they are. - Who? - Bleedin' clocks. - Oh. - What for? I don't know. I'm not a mind reader. Maybe they want folks in the bicycle shirts. Why? It's a bleedin' outrage, the workers. No wonder this country's economy is in the shit. A lovely bit of nonsense. Oh, for Christ's sake. - You realize, Vic-- - It helps the gut ache. By the time the strike's over they'll have the bleeding armored van. Yes, yes. Unless of course, we do it tomorrow. - Why me? - 'It's bit of a rush.' What about the murders? - Can do. - Alright. They didn't pick up today, they have to pick up tomorrow. If we don't do tomorrow, we might as well forget about it. Right, Frank? Very nice car, Terry. Very good steel. Wouldn't mind one myself. Buy one yourself tomorrow. They're there. Want one? What flavor? Super fruit. Yeah, I'll have one. What's the time? It's just 11:00. Watch your tea break. Perfect. He's bloody late. Balls, he's right on the button. Big. Big tough lads. From the local rugby club. Yeah. Well, it'll be short on Saturday. Hang on. Don't push it. Plenty of time. Wipe the wheel. Okay. Alright, this is it. Hold tight. Go. Let's go! They're on to us. Come on, come on, get past him. C'mon, you child. C'mon you, get in front. Go, move it! Brown, you'll fuck it. Stay there! 'Terry.' We've got to get out of here. There it is. Take it easy. You'll bloody kill us all. Don't speak with your mouth full. Crazy going into town like this. Put your face down. You got claret all over it. Nothing like a flat tire to make you feel being conspicuous. - Wanna have a chat about it? - Well, it's buggered, Vic. So we get another car, don't we? Excuse me, as you can see, my friend is sick and.. ...we've got a bit a problem. I wonder if you could uh.. - Did you get a look at 'em? - Yeah. Alright, you two, get out. We can't transfer the stuff here, it's like rush hour. I'm bloody dying. He's losing a lot of claret. Look, Dakin, we got to get him to a doctor. Needle it. You take this car. Meet us tonight. Bring the money with you. All the money. Come on, Terry. Are we having dinner later? Love, I've got things to do, people to see. - What people? - Just people, people. Oh, so that's why we're making love at 6 o'clock. It's as good a time as any. - 'Oh, thanks.' - Can I.. Can I do anything? That's alright, love. You do enough as it is. 'Yeah.' Why else would I put up with a shit like you? Yeah, well, I must have something. 'Energy.' - Well, doesn't everybody? - Not the spastics I meet. You mean the sort of geezers you'd call first class fellows? Oh, that crowd. Just because I get a quick feel and can do a four-wheel drift in a Mini Cooper. 'That he would have approved to Draycott though.' 'They belong to the same club.' Oh, don't talk about Draycott. No more favors, eh, love? Alright, just the one. Take your hat off, will ya? Thank you. Oh no. Oh, don't answer the door, don't. I can't, Patt. No, you're out. Things to do, people to see. Vic. I thought you said about 10 o'clock. So what? A bit early. Don't worry about it. Well, uh.. You want some drinks? Oh. Have a cup of tea. - Anybody else here? - Huh? Anybody else here? A girl. Just a girl, Vic. 'He was having a party, Vic.' Oh, she's nothing, Vic. She's just a high class piece of ass. I rang you, didn't I, Wolfe? Told you I had friends. Things to discuss, you know. Things in confidence. - Vic, honestly, I-- - Get her outta here! Get her outta here. before my colleagues arrive. - Good evening, Mrs. Lowis. - What do you want? - Where's Edgar? - He's not here. Oh, yes indeed, he is. Come on, Edgar. You might as well come inside. It's warmer there. You haven't finished your milk. - How's your tum, Edgar? - You're not helpin' it any. Oh, you'll get indigestion if you swallowed your Wheaties too quickly. I'm supposed to avoid anxiety and aggravation. Any doctor will tell you that. You shouldn't go to work on an egg, Edgar. Your prints were all over, there's egg shells. Well, it's not ketchup, is it, love? What's all these, Edgar? Cut yourself shaving, did you? 'Ed's been here. He's been here all day.' And Frankie Fletcher's upstairs with a sour head. Edgar! Oh my god! Edgar. He's having one of his attacks. 'Don't just stand there. Can't you see he's ill?' Does he often get tooth ache? 'Edgar.' Next time you have one of your attacks do remember not to fall hands first. 'Knock it off.' Hello, yes. No, he's not here. So sorry. Err, I mean he's ill. You want to leave a message? Alright, what is it? Some fella answered. First, some women. Probably Lowis's Mistress. And this fella said he wasn't there. Maybe, he's, he's on his way over. No, no, he's over an hour late. Well, I don't know. Would it be the law? Well, it wouldn't be the boy scouts, would it? Maybe they crossed us, Vic. No, no. Frank wouldn't do it. Lowis hasn't got the guts. If they don't call up, it would seem.. I mean, I don't really know how to think of it. All for-- I won't strain myself thinking if I was you. Just found out there has been a pinch. Lie low. Shut up, and wait. Yeah. Call Wolfe if you wanna find me. He'll know where I am. Well, Wolfe. Can I help, Vic? Yes, yes. I want an alibi. Something good. Not just like "He was here all day playing poker." You know, something good, something really good. Huh? Something good. Wolfe. Whose frightened? Hello, miss. We met before. Wait in the car. I'd rather wait and have a cup of tea. She's got the message. Right? Now, is it Patricia or is it Patt? Patti. I'm sorry, love, I can't hear you. Patti. Patti. Don't panic, Patti. There's nothing to worry about. I'm not a hard case. - Do you want a cigarette? - I don't. Very sensible. How's Binney? He won't let me see him. He says, you know, for my sake, best not to.. I never said anything. Oh, I wouldn't. Not a word. Very sensible. Quit your job, haven't you? Quit your job.. ...living here. You're scared witless. Bet your scared to go to the super market. Right, Patti? I hate this place, but it's safer, I thought. You're off the hook. Haven't got a worry in the world. Live happily ever after. Just one small favor. What do you want me to do? Well, it.. Sit down, love, will you? There's this marquis. And he gives parties for his friends down at the old stately mansion. Whore sorts. Straights, freaks. And I supply him with.. '..new faces.' You mean, girls? Mostly, but not exclusively. It takes all sorts. 'Sounds disgusting.' Degenerate. But at least, they do it in comfort. Now, listen, love. I'm offering you a weekend of gracious living in the country. Butler at the door clothes all laid out for breakfast. All the trimmings, but not strictly kosher. It's just for once, and it doesn't hurt. How's this a favor for you and the others? Well that, girl, is something you need never know. Hello, Mr. Bellamy. Enjoying yourself? I suppose, isn't it? Can I have a little chat with you? What's the matter? Uh, I-I just want to go to the lavatory. Can I buy you a drink? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. When you come back. I haven't said anything. I wouldn't. I mean, you have no worries from me from this end. No, I'm sure I have, Mr. Brown. I...just want to press upon you not to, uh.. ...get too silly, you know. Not to do anything heroic. Oh, you know me. No fear. Yeah. Just wanted to, uh.. ...press it upon you. Here's a couple of centries. Try the Manhattan Club in Greenfield. Or the Sunburn Hills. For 20 quid, they'll do anything. Enjoy yourself. Oh god.. What's happening? The day is happening. Day shouldn't happen until noon. Not until an extremely.. ...large, and extremely spicy Bloody Mary. Do you have any aspirin? Must get something for the head. 'You alright?' 'You didn't enjoy it last night, did you?' You joined in the games, but you.. ...you didn't enjoy it, did you? Doesn't matter. It does, to me. You married? Huh? Yes. 'Family?' I have a daughter. She's about... About my age? It's a bit early in the morning to have a.. ...soul searching discussion, isn't it? 'Rather get back to sleep.' There you are, Mrs. Dakin. Prawns and cockles, fresh in today. Thank you. Cover your shoulders up, mom. It's gettin' a bit nippy. Thank you. Having a lovely time, wish we here? What do you want? How do you do, Mrs. Dakin? Enjoying the air? Yes. Lucky in the weather. Especially for the time of year. Subtle, aren't you, copper? Subtle as a bleedin' air-raid. - What's all this crap? - You want in front of mum, Vic? Old funneled. Alright. - Victor Dakin, I must caution-- - Alright, that'll do. Mum, got some business. Duncan'll take you back to town. Drive carefully. Morning. Well, go on, Mrs. Dakin. Eat up. There's plenty more where that came from. Nice feeling, isn't it? All warm and nice inside. I mean, you've got an audience. Look, all these poor people watching Vic Dakin being taken in. Time me face things, my son. Well, make the most of it. I mean, this is what it's about. This is what you sweat for. This is what you work for. Your wife will be delighted. It'll make up for that fridge she hasn't got. The fridge is alright. It's a new lawn motor. You can't see the nose in front of your face. The last thing I want is a foot tall our imagination. I don't want to be confused by excuses. I don't want to know who's fault it is. We're a very narrow-minded lot, us coppers. We wanna catch villains. If I ever do have any doubts you'd bark them right out the window. I don't know what you'd do without me. Well, if I do get this talk to your group I only hope they turn out to be half as charming as you are. Excuse me, sir. This is urgent I believe. Oh, will you excuse me a minute? On the other hand, whether I am qualified to talk on.. - This is the man. - Alright. Come along. Not bad for a boxed-brownie though, eh? I mean, considering the lighting and everything. Caused a few raised eyebrows at the camera shop. Hey, you should see the movie. Got an offer from Denmark. Look, I can't help.. I can't help Dakin. Gerald Dracyott. M.P., full of noble causes. You used to march with the kids, but now you tires easy so he just sleeps with 'em. It's just a girl. Can't be used against me. Oh, no, not just a girl. Benny Thompson's girlfriend. Can't you just see the columns? Gang war victim's girlfriend and M.P. Constituents the man probe. Wolfe, I can't help Dakin. Not this time. Don't be silly, Gerald. Alibi? I don't believe it. What alibi? We don't even get him into court. Why not? Because he has friends in high places, Tom. You can buy yourself out of anything with money in this bloody country. He's been identified. Oh, for Christ's sake. Better start growing up. Where do you put him against a testimony of a distinguished member of the parliament? I know Mr. Dakin through various charity organizations. 'We are both among the sponsors of a film' 'on mentally handicapped children.' Last Thursday, we had a private screening of that film and afterward, we had a drink and lunch at the Riore Club. But anyway, all this you've written down. I don't see why I have to go through it again with you. Because I don't believe a blind word of it, that's why. That isn't your official view I gather, Mr.. I take it, you are acting independently. 'I'm sure the chief superintendent' 'doesn't know of your visit.' There's a lot of things the chief superintendent doesn't know about. He has to think in broad concepts, and go by the book. But I'm right down here at ground level. I know all the sorted details. You're in big trouble, Draycott. I don't know, money, greed, lust, or sheer bloody terror but you've been guttered. Now, look here-- And if I break that alibi, you and your position 'and your privileges and your committees' are up shit creek. Mom? Mom? Come on, let's get you up a bit. Up. Wolfe, get over here. She's gone, Wolfe. I need you. I need you, Wolfe. Man that is born of a woman has but a short time to live and is full of misery. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower. He fearth as it were a shadow and never continueth in one's day. 'In the midst of life, we are in debt' 'of whom may we seek for succor but if thee, oh Lord' 'Who for our sins are justly displeased.' Yet, Oh Lord God, most holy, Oh Lord, most mighty oh, holy and most merciful savior deliver us not into the pit of pains of eternal death. 'Thou knowest Lord the secrets of our hearts.' 'Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer.' Wolfe? Wolfe. Hello, darling. Oh, I see. Bad moment. Well, you shouldn't have let me have a key, should you, love? Makes a girl feel special, a key. Get out of here, slag! 'Better go, Venetia.' Will you get out? 'You forgot your shopping.' She's nothing. B-bit of a bang, that's all. I don't like that, Wolfe. Don't like that. Stay with me. You're the only one left. Don't leave me. 'Tsk tsk tsk. Dear me.' Dear me. Dear, dear me. What has happened here? It happened during the night. Now, who could've done this? Well, hooligans, I expect. Well, kids nowadays. Read the papers. Drugs, demonstrations. Should never have abolished national service. You call the police? - Well, no, I didn't. - I should do, shouldn't you? You pay your raise, don't you? You call the police. That's what they're there for. Well, Mrs. Lowis, how's Edgar? I don't know where that money is. Well, I just want you to let him know that the lads were concerned, you know. That he was being thought about. You know what I mean? You can't blame him for not saying. Fifteen years he might get. Poor man's gotta have something to look forward to. Fifteen year, fifteen years. Yes, long time. It's a long time. He might come out a widower. Lowis is sick. We're gonna have to move him out of prison to a civil hospital. Hmm, dangerous. I'm certain Dakin hasn't got the money. And Edgar's been getting a lot of visitors. I think you and you men better take charge. Keep an eye on things, just in case. Dakin might have a try. 'Well, we better make damn sure that he doesn't hear about it.' A bloke I know came out of prison yesterday. He got this from someone else, and told me. Get on with it. Well, he told me they'd be moving Lowis. 'Cause he's very ill. Sick in the gut. This bloke says he's getting worse. Bringing up blood. So he's moving to a city hospital. St. Peter's West. - When? - Tomorrow. "Doesn't look well at all," the man said. You know, emergency. What makes you think I'd be interested in the welfare of Mr. Lowis? Well, you know, Vic. You always like to know what's going on. Yes. Yes. I'll send him a get well card. Here. - Get yourself a Guinness. - Thanks. Must find out the visiting hours. Leave well alone, Vic. Have to get the heavy mob. Get some of the lads down from New Castle. Yeah. Mathews. It's Danny. I told him. I don't know if he bought it, but I told him. Thanks very much. Take care. 'Come on, Bob.' Who's driving this thing? Stirling bloody Moss. What's the pissin' rush? Tom. I should think they'd wait a couple of days to get the lay of the land. But you never tell with these madmen. Look uh, I don't want any civilians in this section. You can dress the lads up as nurses. You don't want any civis hurt, eh? - Right. - Okay. And tell them. Now, Tom. Tell them, there's no time for gold medals. So, no heroics. Righty-o. You'll have to wait a few moments. Please take a seat. And would you fill in one of those white cards, please? Oh miss. Is there a toilet around here? Yes, down the corridor. Where you going to? Did you enjoy your cup-a-tea? Put him in there, Jordy. What's happenin'? Webb. What's goin' on? Vic thinks you should have a second opinion. Alright, move him. Do something! Do something, laddy. Don't worry.. 'Listen here.' They've made the switch. He's with Webb. - Get my jacket. - They said it was easy, Vic. - A singe. - Well planned, wasn't it? Maybe it's too easy, maybe it's a set up. You'll need the queen to get you out of this one. Get my jacket, Wolfe. I think it's going to be a lovely day. Hey, look. This isn't my scene, I might screw it up. - I shouldn't be here. - I want you with me. Come on. - How's the patient? - He'll live. You wanna bank on that? Get up. Get up! Well, he doesn't seem glad to see us, does he? I mean, there's no enthusiasm. We sprung you, didn't we? Aren't you glad to be out? I mean, where's the gratitude? Where's your gratitude? I'm sick, Vic. They were gonna operate. I'll operate. If you don't tell me where that money is in ten seconds.. ...I'll open you out. Where is it? It's over here. One of these arches. Wolfe, come with me. I want you. Must be outta your bleedin' mind. I had to, Vic. I had to get Frank to the doctor. I thought the law might be on us. I was gonna pick it up on the way to the fly-dock. Of all the bastard places in London. Get in there! - Get on in there! - Yes, Vic. - Where is it? - Here, Vic. Show me. I wanna see it! It's all different, Vic. Must be another one. Well, we'll find it, won't we? Vic! Vic, it's the law! Vic! Vic, it's the law there. 'You've been set up.' By you. You festering pig. 'No, Vic. No.' Please. No, Vic. 'Please.' No, Vic. Wolfe! Wolfe! Wolfe. - Wolfe, come on. We can-- - Go on. Get away! - Wolfe, I need you! - You blew it! - You blew it all! - I need you.. See them? 'Them?' 'And them?' You can't be frightening all of them. Not all the time. Why not? You call 'em poor slops. We call them witnesses. You know, if I looked at one of them they'd piss in their pants. Because I'm Vic Dakin! Used to be. And who are you? What do you do? Keeping Britain clean on 30 quid a week? Respect? Respect, you don't know what it is! Unless you're Vic Dakin. Tell him somebody, tell him! Hundred witnesses. There's only twelve men on the jury. You remember that. Only twelve men on the jury. Who are you looking at?
