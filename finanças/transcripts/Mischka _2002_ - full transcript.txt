My brother was only a baby when they parted 4 years ago. Mum moved us to London. Life went on, then... I had to see my father again. We both ran away to find him. It was summer 2000. Can I put you down? You're too heavy. I know, this the wrong time but I don't care. Fuck it, I'm 55! Shit! I have to slave for two weeks on a camp-site, like at home, without appliances! And you want sex too! Can't my darlings help you? Your darlings... Hurry up! Come on! Come on, move it! You're not going to shit every 20 yards! What the hell is this? We'll miss the last ferry. You realize that? Come on, get in there. Okay? You know, I don't want to miss the last ferry. Come on, my darlings, get in the car. I only want to do it with you! Only you! You show nothing. You're there, like a blank wall. I don't get it. I just don't get it. I mean, if I drank, I'd understand. If I turned up like other guys... Like a drunkard... They come home different but, shit, I don't! Honestly! You've raised my girls. Thanks for that... Then there's dad. I know, he's... He's my dad. He adores you! I love you after 20 years. - Go ahead, yell. - Not many can say that. Look at all these people. Try asking them. I've done nothing wrong. Okay, I'm not perfect but neither is the next guy! That's a good one! Loads of women would love to do it that way after 20 years. Look at the disasters around you. They're all loudmouths. I mean, open your eyes. I'm here, okay. Then there's dad... He's going on a diet. A diet. Look at him. He's shitting every 2 yards. It can't go on. Calm down, he's in the back. Okay, babies? - Treat yourselves. - And grandpa? I'll see to him. - Thanks. - No problem. I lose everything on holiday. We can give you a ride. - We have to get going. - Right... They're waiting for me. - Drive safely. - You too. Barcelona's out? Barcelona's out this time. Next time. Let's say goodbye then. Blue, white, red! There! French friendly but schnell now! This isn't 1940 anymore! This is Europe, so schnell! Life can be funny. Look at me: an Italian running a Chinese restaurant. Ever seen that? Want to stop? Something wrong? Lemon tarts, you know, your favourites. My little teddy bear... - You're out of your mind! - What? - He's your father! - What did I do? You're carrying on as if nothing happened! You're crazy! Look, he's my father. I do what I can with him. Okay? - You don't do much. - I do. Okay, this wasn't planned but that's how it is. - You're not mad at me? - No, you're right. - We understand. - Okay, let's go. Go easy on the cigarettes. We'll meet by the phone on Sunday at 5, okay? - You won't forget us? - No. See you Sunday. Where is she? We can't hear you! Where is she? We'd like to find out more about ferry passengers. If they're married, divorced, with kids, with pets, dogs, cats, if they bring them along. That sort of thing. It'll only take 5 minutes. What can I tell you? I only use it once a year. - Thanks anyway. - You're welcome. Mind if I call you Mischka? You're like the bear in the slipper in the Christmas story. You're well in time for winter. Or you've touched rock bottom? You've seen it all. It's over... You told the police nothing. As quiet as an old trout. Good job I'm an angler! You look like you should have kids. What're you doing with old folks? It's tough but you're almost there. Did you give it up long ago? Give up what? The bottle. Watch out! They're mean. Right, Jacquot? Who says I don't have kids? There were a lot of us there. There was music. All that music. We danced too. I danced. I love a waltz. Then they bought drinks. Let's take a little walk. No no no, Come on, we're having a walk. Well... Are you all right? What's your name? Not much fun, are you? A walk will do your legs good. How much d'you pay for insurance? I pay 420 francs a month. How about you? - What's it to you? - I pay 420. What do I care? How much d'you pay? Are you insured? You're not speaking? What did I do? G?g?ne! Clear off! Could you get me a chair like his? He fooled you? That fart walks as well as you or me. I'll be right back. You're going too far! It's worse and worse. Since your friend left, I can't understand you. Why do I keep you here? The accident wasn't here... Listen, it's simple enough. Find yourself lodgings in town from September. I don't want to know, okay? - What's going on? - What d'you care? No alcohol here, brother. Here. A G?g?ne special... Know what, we could eat in a place nearby with real french fries. Like the sound of that? I've got the chair. Don't worry. They test them every month. Come on. - All set. - Thank you. Come on. What's up with you? Things are straight with me, okay. Don't complicate things. The Tour de France gives him an appetite. - Here. - It's almost over. Not too tired? The pack's catching the leaders. My dad's good-looking, huh? I never got on with my father. He's dead now. My kids never knew him. I don't see my kids often. We're separated. So, we call on a pal near here, borrow his car, then go to see my kids. I'll introduce you as my dad. Grandpa Mischka. Then back to the hospice. What do you say? What's up with you? It's cut and dried! What's wrong? I'm not so sure about the hospice. You're something else! I have to take you back! I'll get fired otherwise. Anyhow, - you don't know where to go. - Where to go? Straight to the cliffs at Etretat. Can you imagine? Hold on, don't move. My girlfriend. By the way, my pal with the car's called Muller. Bloody Kraut name. We'll say you were in the Resistance. Can you read big letters? Never thought you'd go tobogganing. Especially in summer! There! That's his car. Really lay into him, okay. Don't worry, he'll back down, I know him. "Who rides so late through the windy night" Not again! "Tis the father with his child so light" Goering! Goebbels, Muller! Uwe Zeller! Berti Voltz! Can't you stop pestering him? What's my boy done to you? Go on, get lost! At your age too! Shall we go? You're in a hurry? You're in a hurry? Right... I'm dropping you! The second time in two days. You should've been a paratrooper. I know they dumped you. And who picks up the old shit? You've got plenty of room now. Hey, cut it out! It'll be okay. Fucking divorce! That's nothing to do with it. My daughter Delphine's 15. I haven't seen her for 5 years. All that's the fucking divorce. That's it, where the boat is. What are you waiting for? It's simple enough. Ring the bell and say her dad's here. Don't start pissing me off. Do you realize how fucking annoying it is? They don?t have the heart for it? Anchovies and capers again? Two margheritas and a neapolitan with anchovies. I'll have another slice. Two slices. Okay. Don't tell Grandpa we were at the pool. You mustn?t. There, two slices. - How much is that? - 20 francs. Thank you, young lady. Bon app?tit Excuse me, I'm really sorry, it's because of the cops. My brother and I have left home. I'm only fifteen and I was wondering if you could put us up for the night. We're going to see my father but my mother doesn't know. I can explain if you want. Has Grandpa got his seniors' card? And you're under 18? - And the kid? - He's 5. Three second-class to Bordeaux. Connecting at Auxerre. It's crashed again. The system never works. I'll do it by hand. It'll take time. We're lucky to get the last train. Do you know Delphine, the nurse's daughter? Not at all? You did it! And I left like a jerk! Let me explain. I don't want to know! You have to thank him. No, I want to see mum! Auntie? It's me again. We missed the train. I'll call you back later. What's wrong now? I want to see mum so I said no! - Let's eat something first. - No! Look, it's like a big ship. Like a big spaceship. I call myself Jane. Mum calls me Jeanne. She chose it but I prefer Jane. Maybe but in any case you'll always be my little Delphine. Period. And I won't let your mother... Sausage for Mimi! - My daughter. - Good evening. Is that child yours? I don't know him. After Muller and I had been fishing, we'd stop here for a bite sometimes. She's his ex-girlfriend. She's quite a number. Ask big Mischka, he knows. Remember... I left mum's two days ago. About time too! What's up? You're cold? No, but it's raining. Come here! You know I'm your mummy. I always will be You'll always be my teddy bear. No, my teddy bear, don't worry. I'm your mummy. I'll always be your mummy. You're not dead? Don't mess around. How many fingers? How many do you see? We argued but we're still friends. You could have asked for the car Where's my daughter gone? Don't start again. Not with me. I just spoke to your dad. - Who? - Your father. Are you crazy? You said he was dead but we just met by the river. We talked and we both agree. Well I agree too. Stay! Don't move! Where's my daughter? I want a straight answer She's gone for petrol The tank's empty, remember? I can live with that but stop yelling. You let her go? The station's a mile away on the main road! You watch these old farts fishing while she lugs a 20-litre jerrycan back here? With the kid too. What kid? Just you fucking wait! Because I want to see mum! We'll see her, don't worry. We'll soon see her. Could I have two vanilla ice-creams, please? Yeah, sure. Lena, we're going! All broken. A bit of glass. That's kind of you. Thank you. Come on, honey. - What's her name? - Lena. That's pretty. I'm French. - Are you heading south? - No, north, to Berlin. We're going home. Sorry. Bye. Excuse me, could I get a jerrycan of diesel, please? My father's car's run out. - Give me a couple of minutes. - Thank you. We're having a party at headquarters tonight. It's a send-off for Dominique, the Corsican. Booze, barbecue... Come if you want. - You're invited. - I'll be there. - We have to get going. - Okay. You called them! Over some crap! I called them? I didn't call anyone, okay! Can I count on you? Yes, since I didn't call them. I can't go out with them around! What's your deal with them? They called by to invite me to a party. Okay, I get the message. Look, I've stopped smoking. So stop pissing me off. I need this place. To keep my permit, I have to eat with them. I stopped smoking too. You're getting me mad. Look, we're old friends. You trust me. I didn't call the cops. You won't listen anyway. Excuse me, I was here so I saw what happened. The cops seemed to be asking him to a party. I'm sorry. Hold on, I'm on edge with all the problems people bring me. I'm sick of it. Can't you take me somewhere? Would you take me somewhere? Give me a ride... Sure, no problem. I'm with my brother. It's kind of complicated. We've been here ages. We have to move on somewhere now. Could we talk? Are you married? - Is he your son? - My brother. Leo. I don't believe you. What's your name? Jane. - What's your name? - Angela. Sandra. Dolores. You can get married at 14 here. In the city, people of 30 aren't even married but here... My little teddy bear. He's so brave. I mean, we walked such a long way. He's been really good. I'm still standing. Still standing? I'll leave you then. You don't like it? Could I have some blackcurrant? He doesn't like this. I wanted to go to my aunt's. I could have got to see her for once. My mum can't stand her. She's my dad's sister. We could have gone with her. She could have found my father. She knows the ropes. Is Joli-Coeur your real name? No, we all have nicknames here. A bit like Mischka. You don't know the old man? No, neither him nor the other. That G?g?ne guy. He's half-crazy! I mean it. I hardly know them. You don't know anyone? He's clean now. You can go back in. Get inside. Delphine! - Oh, fuck! - What's wrong? He's pretending to be my dad. Get inside. Go on, get inside. - It's okay. - Why's he here? Come on, you have to leave. Off you go, get out of here. Okay, I'm going. G?g?ne! Hi, my name's Joli-Coeur. The girl's resting at my place, then we're going to leave. The angler in the blue cap is an asshole but he's not mean. However you look at it, G?g?ne's fragile. Like with his daughter. He sends you to the house and waits on the bridge. Then he always starts drinking and vanishes. I thought it might be Johnny. You know, Hallyday. The singer. You have to know him. 15 years ago, he had a car crash around here. I was a volunteer fireman back then. He was sprawled out. I didn't recognize him. When he came round, I was the first one he saw! That's when he knew he wasn't dead. He told me, "You're a friend for life, pal." He calls in when he's on tour. Usually around now. He comes in his chopper. He always brings a feast. Often fish. I don't like fish but I don't dare tell him. G?g?ne and I used to hide out here. We built it together. The seats are from a Jag, except for this one, from a Daimler. I used to work with your son. We went on the wagon together. We had treatment. The hospice paid for it. It did me good. I'm cycling again. One day, I went to see Delphine and she answered the door. She came with me. But he'd gone from the bridge. We found him blind drunk on the other bank. So she went home. He wouldn't believe she came. That's when we fell out for good. The hospice had just fired me: I was too nice to the patients. That finished angling for me. I gave it up there and then. I go car-spotting now. I saw two Delahayes from the same year yesterday. I'm glad you've made up with your son. G?g?ne's a fragile guy. He's very fragile. You want to go to the main beach? To see those jerks? Okay, get the hell out of here. I want you back at the campsite by 7! The stage! - Dry your hair. That's good. - What? You have to dry your hair. Dry my hair? Why? She wouldn't let me go to see Celine Dion because I got bad grades. See what I mean? When I sing and record myself, I hide the tapes under the bed. She doesn't know I've got all that. You look like a real pro now. You think it's for... What are we going to do about Mischka? Careful, we'll catch him! - What's he doing? - He's been adopted. Stop it, Leo! I used to be on stage. You were on stage? Doing what? I used to sing and dance. I was on the road for four years. But he couldn't stand it. He was jealous. He and his pal see who can stay longest in prison. They don't steal or kill, they just don't do anything. They're just drunkards, see. Give me a number 13. 13? They drink, they're no use for anything. They get into a fight with someone and end up in prison. Every ten days, he goes for a week. And I wait. I hardly see him but he has these jealous fits. "Where were you? Why did you go out?" We cry and then he goes. - Life's a mess. - You're mean! Stop it, Leo! That's okay, it's my car. It was stolen yesterday. Well, borrowed... And we're cops, looking for fingerprints. Lend me a hand. It's not working. When I say stop, you stop, okay? I'm serious. Shut your mouth! - Hallyday? - Yeah. - You sang with him. - I've got photos. I used to train two hours every day. It was a tough show. Goldman too? Sardou? - I'll show you. - I must be dreaming! I stood like this, then I started... What? See the balloon? It's sailed off. There's stuff here! - There is? - Come on! Come on, kid. All these bottles! You're a clumsy one! Missed me! I'm not that useless. Again! Time to go. We have to go. I don't think I'll go. Over there. Okay, pal? Shit, you're bleeding. What happened? Are you okay? - Is he your son? - No, he's a friend. Want to see the chopper? What's your name? Let's take a look. You'll see, choppers are fun. Ever been in one before? I've already been in one. Where? In Africa. - In Africa? - Yes. Hold it like that. There. Pull it back. Go on, pull it back. There. Like it? Good, isn't it? Shall we buy it? - I don't know. - You don't know? Time to go. You're in a mess. I've brought you some eels. I know you like them. When do I get to invite you? Can't you stay for dinner? I've done some snails. I don't have time now. I'm on tour. I have to work, see. Next time. I promise. You ought to call the police. It's best to start looking before dark. Delphine and I mended the car, the real owner turned up and the kid's vanished with him. With Muller? That's no problem! Where's the kid? - Where is he? - He was here five minutes ago! I know he was, I saw him. Where is he now? We had a good time, we went in a helicopter. - I don't care! - He was good. If you've lost him, I'll kill you. - He's sweet. - I know he is! I know he's sweet but where is he? Maybe he fell. No, I'd have seen him. I told him to stay behind me. I said, "Stay behind me." - Where were you? - Just here. Why did you run off like that? You can't do that. I was picking flowers for mum. You gave us a scare. I don't believe it. We can go now, if you want. We'll find your father. Leo, we're going to find dad! We're going straight to Bordeaux? When's the plaster coming off? You've been driving drunk! Know what? The manageress fired me. Why? - And? - Look, I'm busy right now. Why are you busy? I met some friends. I'll talk to you later. Sorry about the car. But... Fuck! Wait! I screwed up. I found a bar of soap by the river. You screw up as soon as we turn our backs. I wanted to have a wash. Naked, like when I was a kid. I want to climb the tree. Thanks a lot, that's kind. Your mother won't like it! "The grandfather, "by the bassoon. "The wolf, "the three horns..." - Careful. - "Peter..." I dreamt a family like this. This is nice, isn't it? "The string instruments." You're like the Virgin Mary. I don't know why. I'll take her and her brother home afterwards. We called her mother. I think it's for the best. I'd have liked to see what happens with your father. I bet you'll find him with her helping you. Don't worry. I'm fine here. More than fine. Goodbye, then. You can't park here, sir! My dad's got the keys. I'll find him. What do you want? Fancy a pancake? Got a problem with her? I've got no problem. Okay? Life's strange, isn't it? I wasn't sure. Wait! Joli-Coeur talked to everyone. She was driving all night. She should have been wiped out. She turned up. She was brilliant. We met a guy who knows my father. He said he's on the other side of the Gironde now, in M?doc because of problems with hunters and ecologists. It's 40? and we're stuck in Blaye for the day. Okay, let's go. - Cut it out! - Okay... Calm down. Hey, Zorro, want some chewing gum? There you go. Great. I'll be Zorro! Thanks for yesterday. We found him thanks to you and your pal. - Can I try the boots? - Keep them. - You're serious? - They've been around. I hope they fit. You drove all the way, in the end. You're not too beat? How about you? Just your size. Tell us which campsite you're at. We'll come and see you. What campsite? The ferries are on strike! We'll go via Bordeaux. I've had an idea. Don't say anything. Excuse me. Santa's here! Good evening. They were too hungry to wait for you. The boy's a comical one. The key to the other room. - Okay, thank you. - Good night. Bloody thing. Where the hell are they? This thing's pissing me off. Is there a problem? There's no problem! It stings! Okay? Think it's a present? Let's go and see. We waited for you for two hours. Two hours having a wild old time! You think I'm stupid? You don't give a shit now. You don't need me anymore. We'll see about this later, sweetheart. Go and see Mischka. Try to cheer him up. Go and see him. - Okay. - I'm going. You're sweet. Stop it! - Just a second... - What's that? What did you do to your arm? I set it straight. But your plaster... Straight! You cut too much off. No, it's okay. Hold on, it's okay. But we... It's pretty! I realized. No, we... G?g?ne's not nice to Mischka! G?g?ne's not nice? Well.. - What's wrong? - Old G?g?ne's in the way. Give me the keys! I have to go too. I don't owe you an explanation. Nor you! I don't owe you one either! Don't pay for anything, okay? Don't wonder off like that. I'm serious. Don't you talk to me like that! Go and see mum, she's waiting for us. You thought it was over. You old devil! Asshole! You gave me a real scare last night. What about the car? I've been looking out for it. They stole it. - No kidding! - That's tough. What are you going to do? Okay, Muller? - Yes, and yourself? Are you alright? You're very nice! Are you being nice? Yes I'm being very nice! Great! We've found my father's trail. This guy in a restaurant seems to know everyone. We're going to go there. Let's go! What will you do after? After Mischka, I mean. He couldn't care less. He's happy. He's back in his old kennel. The old dog's crossed France! Happy? You're here! Weren't we going to Etretat? Your girlfriend in the photo... I don't see the cliffs! She's been dead for fifteen years, asshole! Is your daughter my age? You should try looking after her. I know she misses you. My big baby boy! It's so good to see you. - Same here. - Thanks for coming. Okay? I'm fine. You brought the bikes too. - That's great. - I plan ahead. I don't know if I still can. You're lucky. I called in at the campsite by chance. And I got your message. You don't stay there? No, Robert's pain with sport. Even the twins are sick of it. I've found a job in a pizza place. I love it. I'm working... I love it. Where's Grandpa? I think he needed a breather. Talking of breathers, where were you? 15... 16... 17... - Robert! - 20... I'll be going. Look who's here! - Helga, how are you? - Fine, and you? - When did you get here? - It was good. - A week? - A whole week! What did you do all week? It's been a tough week. Last night was fun. Too bad you weren't here. I'm here now. Last night, we went to the ch?teau. We had a good time, we danced... It was great. We drank Sauternes. We're going again tonight. We'll see. You shake me up all right. Stop it! Tell me! He won't speak! Move it, we'll be late? You've taken root? No, it's my grandad? He's my stepfather's father. They lost him on the way. Did Francis call in? He's in trouble! He's more trouble than he's worth. Mona! Tonight, our sound man is Jean-Pierre Janniaud! - How's it going? - He said it again last night. I'm still with my idol. I'm still with Johnny. How are you keeping? I gave it all up because... - I feel in love with a jerk. - You did? - It happens. - And you gave it all up. When we get a night off and we're down here, I rent a car and come here alone. I came here as a kid. I'm looking for the boss. He's easy to find. Besides, he likes you, so come with me. - It won't be easy. - I'm going shopping. You don't need me. You're a big boy. You're his only son, okay. Show you're up to it. Make an effort. Look, it's nothing. It's not... The countryside's good. With your children. When I was kid, I used to wash in the nude. I like the sea but it tires me after a while. Besides, I never know what to do after taking a stroll in the pines. - You just get bored. - I prefer the country. Me too. I mean it. It's wonderful. I loved my grandad. Grandma was kind but strict. We'd steal apples. And I remember... What do we do? You can do what you want! I'm just bored shitless. It's totally different. I spoke to a pal in Soulac about your dad. He's off to look for him tomorrow. Then there's the river. I learnt to swim in a river. A river's nothing like the sea. The calm bores me shitless. Dad.. Are you okay? You know... I've been worried sick about you. I reported you missing everywhere we stopped. You're here now. That's the main thing. I won't disturb you any longer. I'd like to throw a party for dad tonight. You're all invited. Come when you want. You'll be pleased, I've bought you a canopy, a big one. You turned up at the right moment. I set it up this morning. You know, you could have called. Actually, it's not a canopy. I can't remember the name. It's shaped like a pagoda with four legs. So... come when you want. It's straight. Straight up. It went okay, I think. He's like a bear, silent. You feel better now? What's wrong? What's wrong? You like it? Look! It's nothing much but look... A little heart. I've waited so long for this. You took your time. Don't move. Do it up yourself, it's so delicate. Another drop? Not just yet. Why are you crying? We didn't abandon you. Come on. Come on! I'd do like my aunt. She gets here tomorrow. It's great. She's coming straight from Mexico! You bet. Like a fairy godmother. Wait. My father's tired. Give us five minutes. I know what we'll call the boat: "Pirate". And we'll be pirates. Good evening. Grandpa! We were worried. Robert's been expecting you. I've known you 15 years but I could never stand you. I'm telling you straight tonight. Go fuck yourself! Kraut-lover! Bang, bang, the turtledoves! He's a specialist, old Paulo. He ignores the ban. Turtledoves. I know those birds. I read about a scandal with the hunters down here. Europe and Brussels have put a total ban on hunting. You don't do turtle doves, you do Jews! Jews! Six million! In the ovens. Shit... What's oven in German? Hardly surprising... It always casts a chill. I know a guy called Muller. His parents never knew which side they were on. It doesn't matter. That's a pity. Grandpa, you're here? Cool... What the... We're all human beings. For God's sake, what more do you want? You, me, everyone here, up there, Catholic or Muslim. Dad! Mum says dinner's ready. Okay, I'm coming. I'm on my way, be patient, don't panic. Recognize Grandpa? Last year, with Robert and the twins next to us. Remember, Katia? We took the photo last year. Grandpa looks a bit tired. What's G?g?ne doing here alone? The aunt's here. It's just like Mexico now. That's weird. It's really a five. It's all or nothing with you. The baby that can't wait for a feed. So it's often nothing. - Thank you. - Excuse me. You just started a new cycle. And remember, we're in a 2 year. In the middle of it, you can get all your hopes up. There are encounters... journeys... Things move. Things move a lot! What the... He refuses to leave you. Hospital's the only solution. We can't keep him. Mischka, it's me. I'm here, don't worry. I'll leave you in your slipper. For two days, I really thought Jeanne was my daughter. I do have one. Her name's Delphine. Wait till I get you! What did you say? What's on your mind? Nothing. He sued to say that he'd be okay in prison with chicory coffee and buttered bread. Every morning, I give him a slice... But, for the kids, that's no good, they need much more anyway. That's G?g?ne! Where? And my aunt! Go on. Well? Let me look at you! - You look fantastic. - That's Mexico. I got here last night and I met Nino. What a character! He already knew all about me. So you're... - You're on your way. Great. - Stop it! Carry on. All this will do your mother good. I'll call her to tell her that I've found you. - You look all... - All what? I don't know. She travels all the time? No way! She's the head bursar at a girls' school in Auxerre. Funny, huh? Auxerre? What's wrong? - What d'you mean? - I don't know. Business will pick up. - I hope so for your sake. - Just a second. The tax people. I get done every year. They're not cops. I've got something for your dad. I'll tell you after the raid. You'll look fantastic in this. Forget it. Search the tent instead. Could I get two pancakes? Sorry, we only do fresh prawns in the evening. How do you get fresh prawns here? There's a marine farm nearby. - A what? - A marine farm. Not sharp for a photographer, are you? Great hide you've got. Sis! What are you doing here? Just a second... Jeanne? And this is... This is Leo? It's you! - What are you up to? - Look, Leo! - Hello, you're... - Mona. Of course. You know you're my son? No! You're not my daddy! I am your daddy. You don't recognize me. - Okay, Jeanne? - I'm okay... You've changed. It's over, I'm tired of it. It's the last time. This is B?atrice... She lives here with me. I'm not your little man. B?atrice, meet Jeanne, my daughter. Leo, my son. My little sister, Sophie. She's their aunt. Jeanne, this is Jonathan. Go on, Jonathan, play with Leo! Things are simple here. French fries, prawns, plates, cutlery, the simple life. You're right. - You bet we are. - It's so simple Everyone loves fries, you know. Cheers! Good health! Leo, look at your sister! - Now smile! - I can't see her. - You can't see her because... It's okay. - You focus it like this. - Hold on. Look, I'd cut your hair. The three of us were on holiday. This was at kindergarten. You were blonde then. - That one's with G?g?ne. - You remember? It's funny, I imagined you in some workshop, an illegal place, talking to Basques or Corsicans, that kind of thing, see. But actually... Well, it's something else. You're hiding, true but... it's more like a hut. Don't forget the prawns! It's late! Okay, I'm going. But this winter, I'll set up a real darkroom. I want to, you see. I'll build a small rotunda here. A nice, isolated rotunda. It'll be... It'll be great. You're not coming back soon. - Coming back? - Coming back home. It's weird seeing Leo. Is he how you imagined him? I didn't imagine him. You didn't? No. I have to be going. Nice place, isn't it? Look! Honestly! Honestly, it's seedy. In winter, it's lit up, it's lively. There've got blue-grey ones... Okay? Are you and mum divorcing? She won't. That's the problem. Prawns are the solution? Sometimes you have to... It's hard for us. Shall we go back? - You're in a hurry? - No, but... Enjoy your meal. I won't have known him. Don't say that. I'm such a stupid cow! Shit, I want to leave. I've had an idea. Could your aunt look after Leo tonight? I've had an idea. Let me help you. That's kind. - Just press the button. - Here? Thanks! We can't to it. Just a second. - More like this. - I'll remember this. Okay? Yes. Hold on. - Now? - Yes. Tonight, our sound man is Jean-Pierre Janniaud! You do Saturday. I'm not stupid, I'm off Saturday. You'll see. I have to do a "Z" on a heart. The kid'll be filthy in no time. Can't you take care of him? Are you talking to me? I can't wait to get to the hospice! - What? - You heard. She's right. You're not her father. What's the big hurry? She just got here. Watch it, he wants it all. Now! His lordship can't do a thing but for him - everything's straight. - Cut the crap, okay. I only came to say goodbye. And get your address. My address? Heaven! Quitter! Want my ashes too? I want to be cremated, okay! Listen here, G?g?ne... Give me the camera. I'll take it. Thanks. Wind it on, then press here.
