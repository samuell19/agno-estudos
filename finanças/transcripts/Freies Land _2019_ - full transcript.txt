Thank you. ...people experience the planned construction east predominantly as the exact opposite. Companies are closed Industries relocated to other regions. The economic downturn let all over the east ... Patrick Stein. Oh we thought They don't come any more. There was a cow in the way. We have already taken your room. - And now? Sleep in bed with your colleague. It's already there. I will let you know if something becomes free again, yes? ...said Waigel that he was ready To compromise but they would have to be sensible. The way out of the debt trap can't be done with him ... Hello? Police. Bad luck. - Me too. Patrick Stein. I didn't get a room anymore. - Identification card? Right back pocket. Excuse me. I don't know a cop who fights so badly. I have other qualities. - Mmm. Markus Bach, chief inspector. Police Goerlitz. Tell Markus. I don't like the behavior. We have to get up early tomorrow. We eat something and go to sleep. I miss you already. - I also you. Very. Dude ... How's the little one doing in the oven? - Okay so far. What does the doctor say? Today was prevention. - If you had been there, you'd know. I don't like that either. - Just say no. He's the police chief! I was less than half an hour in Rostock then I was sent on. In this damn town. - Patrick, you take this too personally. The whole management floor seems corrupt to me. I have to quit. Sleep well. - Hello. Don't mess with everyone again. - I'll be there for the birth, I promise. Patricia is the older one. She is 17. Nadine is 15, I think. 16. - Tell me, Meli will you take the breath out? Thank you very much. - Where were they last seen? At the exit. Her father is a ferryman across the Neisse. You live outside of Löwitz and went home from the fair. A neighbor saw them get in a car around midnight. She was the last to see the girls. - The car, what brand? Probably VW Golf. Model? - No idea. She wasn't sure. - How long ago was that? Two days. Delicious sausages. Is there a butcher in town? Mmm. - And the mustard? - Bautz'ner. Westerners can't. They just can't. Is it your first time away? - Well, they have a reputation. But they were always home before one. - What reputation? Well, hold a call. You already know. No. Explain it to me. They just like to have fun. - And you don't? They are sluts. Everyone here knows. Is there still a grain? Another ten. For both. Don't pull a curse like that. You got that into yourself. For a few grams of coke you take not the boss's brother hops. Is that how it works here? - With you too, it seems. You're right. The GDR is full of state criminals. But the west is with crime to make good state. - Right. You westerners buy us stupid Ossis the country away with the criminal coal. At least the spying is over. - Yeah, keep dreaming. In any case, I may as a reward investigate with you. In the blooming landscapes. - No enthusiasm for building east? But of course. That'll be great. "Germany United fatherland." Your cynicism brought you here, huh? - This isn't a punishment for me. I'm not a great West Commissioner who wants to play the hero. No, you prefer to hang out in bars and rip off whores from what you hear. PH'. What else have you heard about me'? That's enough. You can't fight. And you can't shoot either. I take the wine and two cups, please. Just a mug. Keep the change. Good night. Good night - I sleep by the window. - Yes. Priest. Uh, Sigi, what are they drinking back there? Vodka. - I'm giving a round. Is that enough? So go on me. What time is it Late. Stand up. I got your car out of the swamp to let go. Is in the workshop. You can pick him up tomorrow. They lent us a car. Friends and fellow citizens, all come to the VEB tomorrow and support our strike for safe work and fair wages. The decline of the VEB would be the decline of Löwitz ... I heard that the girls wanted to get away from here. By whom? - People like to talk. When they're drunk. Yes here. And where did they want to go? - Just go away. The two supposedly had much argument with her father. Sch! Catherine! Katharina, bring the gentlemen two beers. Good afternoon. - Good day. Good day. Oh, that's nice. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. What smells so good here? - Ragout Fin. With Worcester sauce? Yes, recently there are also real ones to buy. What do you want to know? - Where is the girls room? May I? Do you have any idea, where could they have gone? Was there trouble? Do you know if something is missing? - A passbook that belonged to the girls. Dress. Do you know why they wanted to leave? My girls didn't want to leave. - Hm ... Have your daughters been threatened? New car? - Bought used. Tired of the old Trabi, huh? - I didn't have a car. 15 years waiting period. What do you want here? We want to find your daughters. - What. Nobody cares for my girls. Here. I fished that out of the oven. If he finds out he's killing our girls. He's so ashamed because of you. Were they traveling alone or with someone? Hm? Your friends have disappeared. Do you care? So now open your mouth. Otherwise you can think in the cell if you can think of something, so ... Were the sisters alone? Yes. Did you talk to them - You were far away. We were together briefly later. On the bumper car. Then we are home. That was just before midnight I know exactly. Where did you split up? - At the crossroads on the outskirts. You have to go a little further than us to the ferry house. Do you know if they have a boyfriend? - No. You wanted to get away from here. - Who does not want that? I do not want to go away. - You are pretty stupid. And you're just jealous. Did you tell where you were going? - Where it's better than here. Do you know a friend who has a golf? In blue? Maybe Corinna saw something. The old woman lives on the outskirts. Beautiful Charlie! - What do you all have? Her friend is there. Can we go now? Yes. The beautiful Charlie. Your son? - Yes. It's four weeks after the wall came down away to Munich, because of work. And that? - My daughter Elvira. She studies in Leipzig. And this is my youngest. It is two months ago away to Berlin for work. Please tell me again what you saw. Over there by the place-name sign he stopped. Have you seen, how many people were in the car? - No Were the girls forced to get in? I think, they knew the driver. I heard laughter. - Who was laughing? The driver? Or the girls? Uh yeah But the driver was definitely a man? I made a few sketches. This is a Golf I. With rectangular rear lights. This is a Golf II with rounded rear lights. Well, I didn't pay much attention to that. I think the. Of the? Golf II. Who are they? - Short-time workers from Poland. Our kids don't have jobs because they work for a third. Maybe your kids want not doing such a job anymore? You know him. I'm sure he's from here. Or he's a seasonal worker that comes every year. Or is it someone who works at the fair and is here regularly. The girls' father has a Golf II in black. Stand behind the house. At night black turns blue. Anthracite and gray are common. Listen. There is someone who wants to talk to you. Angelique is a clairvoyant. She sees things. When she sleeps she talks to the dead. Sit down. Have tonight talked to my dead mother. God bless them. She saw the two girls. At the farm between Dallgow and Löwitz. The servants' house at the junction to Pritt. What is? Nothing. Patrick, come here! Help me out, I'll get her out. Do you have me - Yes. It's not enough. Even deeper. - Watch out. One more piece. Careful. Yes. I have ... One more piece. Yes. I have her! - Do you have it? - Yes. Stand still! Do not shoot! You're welcome! - Why are you running away? I ... I have no hunting permit. Where are you from - From Löwitz. Oh get up. What's your name - Richy. So, Erich Horn. But everyone here calls me Richy. Do you still know me from the bar? - My head is buzzing from the vodka. How do you get here - Well, on foot. Very far from the village. - I know the paths. Did you see someone In the servants' house? I don't like the place. - Hey, you idiot! What do you get for the pig? - Tens of pounds. You don't sell that. Let it cook. With a salad. You owe us run. Run! Piss off! Damn asshole! Fucking bum! Did you get something out? Nothing. - And in the well? Rubbish. Then nothing. Over here! Nadine. Patricia. Get in the car. I forgot my notebook there. Where was that? - Down there. Then why are you putting it here? - Well, about the other things. So that nothing is lost. I can bring it back too. - No, just don't touch anything anymore. Come on, report. Multiple injuries to the chest. A couple of cuts. Probably stab wounds. Severe burn on the left hand. She was definitely tied up during a longer time. We don't have anything like that. - And the second body? Cuts on the neck, Abdomen, rib cage. Left hand, three amputated fingers. Signs of vaginal injury. She was probably raped like her sister. Help me to turn the body over. Serious injuries to the anus too. The way the bodies are swollen they were in the water for a day or two. There are burns on the neck. The minor injuries probably come from small animals. Where does this path lead? - To the sewage treatment plant. Clarify the Schiet von Löwitz, Dallgow, Pritt and Bednarz. Hey Hey hey hey Who are the photos for? Hey - "Barnimer Tagblatt". Who called you? - Source protection. Go away. - I can help. Get out of here, you vulture. - Give me information! Hey This is a free country now. Freedom of the press. Ever heard - Yes, again tomorrow. Come on, Mr. Stein. Come on. Clear this up quickly, and with the utmost discretion. We have enough trouble already with the whole ... With the strike. We don't need any more chaos. Not more uncertainty, huh? Come on, let's go. Headquarters in Rostock. We have to make a report. You were not murdered here. He has it thrown out of the car. There are two tire tracks. They wanted to the sewage treatment plant and turned around here. Maybe he saw someone and got nervous. Maybe he wasn't alone. You notify the parents. You know them. - No You do that. We meet them every day. You will be gone soon. But we have to go on living here. I do it. Thank you. Will you take the gentlemen over there a bottle of vodka? I pay. So, my little one, off to bed. The wages are in the east only at 82 percent of the western level ... Ah hello! Um, that arrived for you today. And, Mr Stein, your wife would like for you to call her back. Thank you. Last year the population is shrunk by six percent in the east, Except for East Berlin. This trend has now stopped, says the government commissioner for the East. However, he sees despite all the successes also a lot of skepticism and dissatisfaction. This is the greatest challenge demographic change, of the east earlier and harder. Some regions threatens a downright aging ... A man wants to speak to you. He's drunk and has a gun. Who are you? We're from the police. You're not cops. What do you want here? We don't sleep in uniform. - Stay away! Do you want to see my brand? Stay away. - I'll show you my brand now. Do you see? Here. Now give us your rifle. It is not loaded. I'm so sorry. We need to talk to someone. She was my friend. He killed her. Theresa. My girlfriend is too disappeared a year ago. Like his. He kills them, chops them up and throws them into the river. That's why you only have found her foot. What kind of foot? - It was her shoe. I know it! I got her shoes two years ago bought at the fair. She said she was coming back. - From where? Berlin. She had found work in a posh hotel. She wanted to come back. She loved me Nobody brings himself with a suitcase in hand. It was hers. He was found floating in the river. Rolf. Who do you think it was? We came back late. - What does late mean? Well, very late means very late. - You only think about work. Don't start with that. - You don't care about anything else. Man i work here! - Stay calm. I am calm. You are not calm! - Good Morning! How, hospital? What happened then? For the final examination. Don't you remember Ah. I'm under so much pressure here. My colleague is a strange bird. I'm sorry. I don't want to stress. - I'll call you. Yes, we heard about the incident heard last night. What's wrong with disappearing from Theresa, Rolf's friend? The girl was sick in the head. No wonder it went into the water. With suitcase? - Was the body ever found? The river is long. - What about the severed foot? Times the propeller seen from a coal truck? Who is Katrin? A girl who runs the village wanted to leave and did it. The autopsy report has arrived. And a list of all VW Golfs, who are reported in the area. Everything as discussed this morning. - Mmm. Tell me, do you sleep sometimes too? Sperm traces on the stockings from Patricia. Group AB. They have knives and pincers used. We need this suitcase watch from Theresa. A fisherman has it found near the ferry terminal. According to forensic medicine it was a propeller. Hm ... Nobody from Theresa's family knew that she wanted to go away. Strange. That was also the case in the sisters' room. We need to talk to the relatives. Well, Richy, not on the hunt? We're looking for the house from Rolf's friend Theresa. We can it not find on the map. What's in it for me? Man, man, man I said that nobody lives here anymore. Hey Should i open it? It looks like they're gone. From now on equal. They are gone as her daughter went into the river. Then wanted her house no longer enter. Heard they are now somewhere in Hungary. Do you know the? This is one of the dead sisters Patricia. And that's Theresa. And Katrin, she's gone too. And that's Charlie. "Three angels for Charlie". Do you know where Katrin lived? By the fish. She was the first that was gone a few years ago. Still lived with her mom. We'll be at the fish farm in a moment. Far out. Like the other girls. Well, you flitzbeep. What's your name Markus. And you? Markus. Granny! Granny! She was gone three years ago when the fair was. She got that from me. That brings her luck, she said. - Fine. Well, Markus? Do you want to tell the gentlemen who that is? My mommy. - Exactly. How old was he when she left? Not even a year. She didn't say where to go? Looking for work in Berlin. She said she's coming back when she found something. She might have changed her mind. - What? She could have changed her mind! - Do you have children? Nearly. His wife is pregnant. Was there anything unusual before she disappeared? She was very sad, because Charlie left her. Charlie? - Yes, Charlie! The beautiful boy from Bednarz. Did she go to school? In Löwitz? Sure, of course. She wanted to study. That's why she has additional at night school learned. May we meet look at their school supplies? Thank you very much. Can we borrow this? But don't lose that. She will need it when she comes back. What are you doing here? Who are you? Who are you? Is good is good! It's good enough. Don't make a wrong move. Did you know Nadine and Patricia? - Yes. Like everyone here. - What relationship did you have? I was with Patricia once. But you know that. Wasn't she a little too young? Too young for what - And Nadine? We were good friends. - Did you take pictures of them? Do I look like a photographer? - Do you want another one? Where were you when they disappeared? - At a friend's place. Brown long hair, 16 years old? What's this? Is that his taste? Damn wanker! - Ey! Is good. Hey, it's good. It's good enough. Is okay! Is okay. - So where have you been? With Nicole, all night. - How do you know them? I do not know. And the? - I don't know either, I'm sorry. You are in the photo. - I guess I met her that evening. Can i go now - Fuck off. But this is my knife. Then get it. Do me a favor, come Hm? They were all the same age. - Much too young. They are all disappeared during the fair 1989, 90, 91 and now. All after the fall of the wall. - There's been something like that before, believe me. Murders were popular here swept under the table. It didn't exist in socialism. That would be a great coincidence when all the girls go away when there is finally something going on here. There are a lot of people in town for the fair. More is being drunk. It takes time to go missing. It's easier to get to know people. All the girls knew Charlie. And everyone wanted to leave. Did you see his tattoo - Mhm, like in the photo. Tell me what's the name of the lady in Bleu? This is Daniela. Are you bringing this to her? And a drink of your choice. - Strange. He is the top dog here, could have all. Why does he do this? You look tired. Go to sleep. How did you know that my wife is pregnant? I have good ears. You can have the car. I don't care, I go on foot. I would like two more packages of Red Leaf. Stop doing that, Carsten. Oh come on Just for fun. - Stop it! I do not want that. No, hands off. You're shit! Man, what are you doing Excuse me, should I take you home? Hands off. Breathe. Evelin? Listen to me. Pack your things and leave town. What? How so? - Strange things happen here. You may be in ... You may be in danger. In danger? What did you do? - Listen! Leave Hamburg. Go to your parents until i'm back But the baby can come at any time. There are only two weeks left Until the meeting... Evelin, it's serious. Get the child and you to safety Roger that? Yes. - Well. Bye. I'm alone. Come in. What can you tell me about that? That the left one has nice tits. This is Nadine and she is dead. That she had nice tits. What do you want to know? - Anything you can tell me about that. Where did you get that from? - It doesn't matter. I am a journalist. - I laugh my head off. Here, send it then to Schwerin in the KTU. Here. - I have no time. What do you want? Something I don't know yet. They have been tortured. - You raped too? I got your story heard in Hamburg. With your boss. You dare to do something. A man with ideals. A few years ago I would have You written the winner. Ah, it's import. A rare make. I don't think there are many here use this material in the area. I can tell for sure who. Mmm. - I want photos from the corpses of the girls. From the coroner. I have a family man. They need to feed. Does your family know what you are doing? Who thinks I'll be the next Stefan Heym. An author. You may have heard of him. Find out. I think, I also know your colleague. You know, whether he worked in Bautzen? Say hello to him for me. "The Lord will keep you, the Lord is your shadow over your right hand ..." Is there anything worse than to bury your own children? I thought you don't have any My condolences. - My condolences. I have the savings account found my daughters. It was in the glove compartment of the car. My husband hid it there. Can we have it Yes. We found this in the car. What happened, Henner? I have a lot of debts and can't pay her. With whom? A credit shark. How so? I wanted my daughters get out of this village. The whole family. Hm ... You take out a loan for your daughters. And then you steal their savings account? What happened? Tell me. For the last time. Tell me. I found a package two months ago. On the banks of the Neisse. - What kind of package? Pills. Ecstasy. That's how it started. How much? - A kilo. What did you do with it - Sold. - To whom? Here in town. - Where is the money? Spent it. For what? - For the damn car! Do you think that's why killed your daughters? I do not know. They came to get their money. Refrigerator, washing machine and they already have televisions. If I don't pay, then take away my car and ferry. We must activate the local police. They should run the river and closely watch the banks. Then maybe we will find out who the guys are. I take over the river. - I'll take care of Charlie. Never send me out the door again. I don't like your methods. Without these methods we wouldn't have cracked it. Yeah fine Then goodbye. Nicole is at home. The mother says she is fine. The village police are in the thick of it. They inform the smugglers for money. The whole village smokes contraband. From scrapping and shrimp felling alone they can't live. Sit down. - I prefer to stand. You sit down What did you do in the hunting lodge today? - I was with my girlfriend. Do you want details? - Yes I would like to. Didn't anyone tell you? Who is the man in the hat? Which man? - Who went into the house after you. There was nobody except Nicole and me. You wanted my blood, didn't you? Then call a doctor. I'm waiting. Should have brought sleeping clothes. You are staying here overnight. Are you okay? Are you okay? - Damn shit, yeah. A beer and a vodka. - Me too. We are closed. Is good. Come on, he's not worth it. Holy shit. All tires slashed. There you see what happens if you put up with everything. What now? Still a cuddle course? Just because that used to work you can't play Stasi forever. Shut up, wanker. These are the results of the blood test by Karl Gross, called Charlie. His blood type is not what you are looking for. This is a democracy now. If you want to lock someone up ask me next time. This land is no more what it used to be People have hoped for a lot. And there are those who are disappointed. The police are on the front line as always. So hurry up. Let's present our sheep soon the big bad wolf. From Charlie we can't get anything out. Is there no school today? - Got a stomach ache. What did you do last night? Movie theater. - Nice. With who? - With friends. Which? I'll be right back, my darling. Nicole. You were at the hunting lodge yesterday. Who else? Who was the man in the hat? - Which man? Where is the injury from? - Which? - That one. She is a rash from my watch. Stop the nonsense! Who was the man in the hat? - Who are you talking about? Where's Charlie? - No idea. How? You're sick, and he doesn't visit you? He doesn't know. - Why? - Look at me. Your mother knows what are you doing in the hunting lodge, huh? Does she know about Charlie? Mummy! - Tell us who this man was! Mummy! Mummy! What is it? - I have to throw up. Ui, ui. Yes don't worry we wanted to go anyway. What you up to? Do you believe her a word? Here, hold on. Do you want to tap into her phone? Do you have the police director not heard? Hm? We can't do that. No more. - She is afraid. But why? Give it to me. Would you like to rent a hunting lodge? Come in. Yes there are three bedrooms. Each with two beds. Look around. I have extra beds if you are more people. There are dog kennels, water, electricity. Everything there. Have you ever been to the area? Do you know your way around here? Is that your house? - Pff! It would be nice. Here is a bedroom. Take a look around. Who last rented the house? I forgot. It was closed for a long time. It is closed season. Hmm, it's closed time. I was here yesterday. And then three people went into the house. I like the brand. - Oh yes? Ouch! You hurt me! - I don't like being lied to. Who was here yesterday? I do not know him. I don't know who is renting it. Are you renting the house to strangers? - Only on a daily basis. He calls me and deposits the money! Not so loud! Who is the man in the hat? Hm? Who? - Ah! They pay so that I stay out of it. What are you doing there? What are you doing here? Nothing, everything is fine. You looked at the house but go ahead. Yes, goodbye. - Bye. Do you know him The security guard? - Mmm. Never seen. Maybe he's coming over from Poland? We have to find Charlie. I have an idea where that could be. Go play, Richy. Fuck off. Weapons. I'll show you where to go. What do you want from us? - We ask the questions. Come on, go. Come on, get down there. Make yourself comfortable. Frik, give them a drink. The gentlemen are sure to be thirsty. The pills that Henner found belonged to me. A handover didn't go that way as it should have been. But I didn't kill anyone. Especially not girls. This is Hugo. You know his wife Angelique. She is not a clairvoyant. At night, when the girls were murdered Hugo was on the old farm. He knows the well and saw more. But the information costs something. - What does that mean? You're pulling the police down the river and leave us alone. - Okay. Talk, Hugo. I've seen a man threw the bag in the well. What did he look like? It was too dark to see his face. Otherwise quite normal, just average. Why were you there - I was waiting for a package. Five in the morning. The day the girls disappeared. Did you see his car? - A golf. Pale blue, almost gray. For sure? - He drove right past me. I even saw the sticker at the rear window. What kind of sticker? - A girl with long hair and a hat. The hair, how long was it? So far? A little shorter. What about the hat? What did it look like? Large, with a very wide brim. Like this? Yes, that will work. Where have I seen that before? Anything else? - I do not know more. I saw what you did. They will come and get you. It is nearly time. Stop for a moment. Come over. She talked a lot about the nice colleague who brought her the stickers. These towels are from him too. From the hotel in Berlin where he worked. What was the name of Katrin's colleague? - Janosch. Surname? - Is he from around here? I do not know. - Have you ever seen him? - No She said a lot about him. He helped her than that with Charlie. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye, little Markus. Yes, in the early evening I am with you. Janosch Junckers. No longer works in HOTEL KOSMOS. Was fired. But he still has things. I'm going there tomorrow morning. - Nightcap? No, I still want to be in contact because of the photos. Maybe it's a lead. Well. Do not let anyone stop you. No way. Meli, is there anything else? I'm hungry. And thirst. The photos of the girls were made with such a material. There is only one shop in the area who sells this brand. Where? . Yes! WHERE? Where are my autopsy pictures? Unfortunately I don't have them yet. - What do you have then? ADLER FOTO in Rostock. Someone orders them there every month against prepayment. Who? - Apparently a "good looking guy". A guy named Carlos or Charlie. Mh, they develop them there too, but didn't want to say what kind of photos it is. Definitely no confirmation pictures. - In this photo... It's not just about the girls. The one who took the picture can be seen in the mirror. You don't recognize him because of the lightning. Can it be helped? Find out who that is. Then you get your photos. But for that I need the negative. Otherwise it is not possible. Trust me. - Would you trust someone like you? Great Indian word of honor! Can he sleep at night? - Huh? Your colleague, Bach. I know where I saw him. 1978. He was with the State Security. He has arrested my best friend Stefan. Stefan was also a journalist, wanted to write the truth. Your colleague's gun always sat pretty relaxed. Stefan wanted all the pushing himself not put up with that. Maybe fidgeted a bit. And before the gates of Bautzen, Bach shot him there. Resistance to state power. There were plenty of witnesses but Bach received no punishment. Just his medals. And now he's dirty the Stasi pig. And that makes me happy. I'm so sorry. I did not know... Could have been a trap too. - I went to Nicole. I need to know, what was wrong with my daughters. You are... They were close friends. And? - Charlie took her to the cabin. There he tied her to the bed went out and came back with someone. Can she describe him? - All she knows is that he smelled good. Some special perfume. And he had very soft hands. She kept saying that. Charlie took pictures of her and threatened to show the photos all over the place, if she tells something. On the night that my two daughters were murdered Charlie was with Nicole, however not all night. Would she tell a judge that too? - She couldn't even tell you. I'm going to Berlin. Maybe the killer has there worked in the hotel. Take me with you. - I can't just take you with me. But I ... I am a witness. I could be of use. What do you want in Berlin? You're welcome. Please, I have to go there. You're welcome. I am to blame for the death of my daughters. I have my daughters over and over again told of my dream. I wanted to get out into the big city. Acting, dancing, singing, Waiters. The main thing is to get out of this shit mess. I just infected them with my stories. You couldn't wait to get away from here. My dream killed her. Good day. Patrick Stein. The hotel manager is waiting for me. - One moment please. Katharina, please wait here on me. I come with. The guy was weird. He had a problem with a female guest. What kind of problem? - He got down to the girl. She's to the police, I think. And that was why he was gone so quickly. Just because. Janosch Junckers, yes. When was it? Mmm. And it wasn't anymore seen in Dallgow? Friends family? Understand. I thank you. Melanie? Patrick Stein here. Put my colleague on the phone. What? He is still sleeping? Well, go upstairs then and knock, yes? It is important, that he learns ... Katharina Kraft made a new statement. Charlie wasn't out all night with Nicole. A stranger mistreated her in the castle. He has very soft hands and wears an expensive perfume. Yes, that's all. Sorry. Will you show me Junckers' room? The staff rooms are also in the basement. Room seven. You are lucky. Is currently empty. Can you find it alone? I have appointments. Mr. Bach, I'm coming into your room now. Mr. Bach? What do you want? - I'm supposed to give you this. The decline of the VEB would be the decline ... Where can I find the VEB? - Come all tomorrow ... When does this stop? When does it stop? When does it stop? When? I dont know. When does it stop? When does it stop? When does it stop? When ... when does it stop? You know that your company since the fall of the wall against western competition has to fight. Steel prices are in the last six months down by 30 percent. We bought the factory to save her. To do this, we have to cut costs and adjust wages. Otherwise the company will not survive. You can't do that to us! You can't do that you pigs! You pigs! - This is our company! Mr. Langhans, the new owner, offers you to work for 20 percent less. Then he can get all jobs. If you don't want that, you can go. Are you crazy? Damn cutthroat! Give us back our VEB! That's all here just a fucking capitalist bullshit! Mr. Langhans! Forgive me. I want to introduce myself. Markus Bach. Criminal police. - Karl Langhans. Owner here for three months. - I'm coming about the murders. Oh yes, the dead sisters. Also. And the others. I am always at your disposal if I could help. Goodbye. We have to go back. Yes OK. Yeah don't worry Mmm. Thank you, Manuel. Thank you. According to the foreman, there is no golf on the factory premises or the Langhans estate. Neither registered nor unregistered. The license plates are probably fake.
