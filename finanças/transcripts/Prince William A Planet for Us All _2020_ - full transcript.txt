William: I've always loved nature. - Oh, there. Here. - There you go. Brilliant. Look at that. But fatherhood has given me a new sense of purpose. Now I've got george, charlotte, and now louie.

We'd love to come here and show our children. You can impress george with your geography knowledge. Finally my geography chat is useful. ...Inspiring people. A recognized face. Good morning. The children were very upset that we were coming to see you and they weren't coming. They're massive fans of yours. Attenborough: Kids know an awful lot about what's happening to the world. It's very remarkable. I don't want to have a sea empty of all these amazing animals. William: There's been much to smile about... If you lived in the bugingham palace, what bug would you be? I would be the queen bee. You'd be the queen bee, I'm sure. - This is pacha. - Pacha. Hi, pacha. You look like trouble. You're like my little charlotte. [ laughter ] ...And moments that I found haunting. It's just a mind-blowing number of tusks. Above all, it's opened my eyes and given me hope. This is where the horn belongs... on a live rhino. That's where it should stay. Quickly, get the rhino before it goes. Somebody has to put their head above the parapet and say, "I care about this." I have belief that if we all work together, we can make a difference. There you are. That's probably the first-ever reed warbler you've handled. It is. I think he's ready to go. Yeah. Okay.

[ Birds chirping ] It takes me back to my childhood hearing that noise. Narrator: As a young boy, prince william developed a deep connection with the natural world, one he now shares with his own children. William: Seeing my children, seeing the passion in their eyes and their love for being outdoors. They find a bug or they love watching how bees are forming the honey. George particularly, if he's not outdoors, he's quite like caged animal. He needs to get outside. Narrator: His children's passion for nature is no surprise. It's in their genes. William: My grandfather, my father have been in the conservation and the environmental world for many years. My grandfather was well ahead of his time, my father ahead of his time. I really want to make sure that in 20 years, george doesn't turn 'round and say, "were you ahead of your time?" Because if he does, we're too late.

Sir david has been a voice for the environment for many, many years. He's been a fantastic inspiration. A recognized face. Good morning. Nice to see you. Very nice to see you. What do you think? [ laughs ] I hope they'll do something about the floor. The floor, exactly. Yes. The children were very upset that we were coming to see you and they weren't coming. They're massive fans of yours. They watch all your programs, honestly. Do they? They watch your programs, yeah. Honestly, absolutely fascinated by it, yeah. I've got them quite onto the african ones, 'cause they're quite fond of africa, but they love all the programs. Narrator: Like sir david, his oceangoing namesake is destined to unearth nature's biggest secrets in the remotest corners of the planet. The british antarctic survey hope it will help them better understand the climate crisis. The polar regions are really the most sensitive areas of the planet to climate change. The british antarctic survey have been monitoring changes in antarctica for many, many, many years. We can see that the ice really is thinning and it's cracking. The glaciers, they've shrunk and they've retreated. It's very difficult to predict just what it is that is going to be the key thing. So, for example, the discovery of the ozone hole in 1986, they weren't looking for that. They were just... no, I mean, they were just doing their standard surveys, and then they noticed this hole. That rang the warning bell, and that was the british antarctic survey. We know that a lot of the ice shelf in the western part of the antarctic is melting. It's actually a good way, as well, to connect the public to the amazing research and to the environment like that that they might not be familiar with. Well, that is so. And the public is becoming extraordinarily well-informed, in fact, it seems to me. I mean, kids know an awful lot now about ecology and about what's happening to the world, and it's very remarkable. I wonder who's taught them so much about it. They have. Every generation, you know, after yours, david, has grown up listening and seeing all the things that you've shown them, and hopefully generation listens a little bit more. - Hi, everybody. - Hi. - What's your name? - Yasemin. Hello, yasemin. You're? George: I think I need to be, like, a scientist. I want to try and help the polar ice caps, to stop them from melting. And do you know where it's going? To the antarctic. Oscar: They will see penguins and killer whales, but it's really cold, so, like, you can get frostbite, apparently. Catherine: I wonder what they're going to discover. They could discover things they don't even know about. I'll be distraught for all the penguins to just lose their environment 'cause they need the antarctic to survive. This is 85,000 years old, this piece of ice. Now we can tell what the atmosphere was like 85,000 years ago. What sort of things would be breathing air that's in the ice of 85,000 years ago? - Dinosaurs. - Saber-toothed tigers. - Yeah, saber-toothed tigers. - Saber-toothed tigers. There you go. So that ice you saw of 85,000 years ago, the air that was in there was being breathed by saber-toothed tigers. How cool is that? And woolly mammoths. Woolly mammoths. Amazing, isn't it? The world, at the moment, is facing great, great problems. And the most aware of that are the young people of today who will inherit this world. Thank you very much.

Narrator: Down the road from liverpool's footballing champions, an inspiring group of children have their own goal... Ew! [ shouts indistinctly ] ...To give nature a helping hand. Elliott: The eco emeralds are a group of environmentalists. Who like to garden, get covered in mud, chat, and save the world. I don't want to drop it. It's wormy! It's wormy! It's wormy! Narrator: The eco emeralds are beginning with insects by building a giant bug hotel with a familiar ring to it. [ Indistinct talking ] Prince william is dropping in for a surprise visit. It's fantastic that you're here, really. So thank you so much. No, it's great. I'm keen to see it, actually. Really am. [ Indistinct talking ] They're very keen to see you. They don't know yet, okay? As long as you haven't told them that someone from manfield's turning up, it's alright. [ Both laugh ] they'll be very upset. I've got a worm! It's very long.

What's your name? I'm poppy. Hi, poppy. I'm william. Daisy. Daisy, poppy. - This is nell. - Nell. Hello, nell. Abigail, elliott... We need to look after bugs because worms help fertilization. Can you tell me what you've been up to? Finding bugs? The bugingham palace. Bugingham palace. I love it. [ laughs ] is that the queen bee? Very good. We made all different sections where the animals go. Girl: So this is where we put, like, the slugs. Girl: Like, at the top, we've got grass. That's where the worms live. Oh, look at that worm. You know, they don't like being in your hand 'cause of the heat. Yeah. Narrator: There's one very special kind of bug for whom the children will roll out the red carpet. We gonna get some bees in there this summer, do you think? Yeah! Why are bees so important? Because, like... They create 75% of our food chain. They pollinate. Yes, and why is pollinating plants and flowers really important? Because... Because the flowers and plants, they bring life to our air and they help other animals like caterpillars. If there was no nature, no bees, no food, no us. Very important. We've also got a few questions for you. Have you? Okay. Ask me questions. If you're asking me about percentages of bees and things like that and what stings, I might not be able to answer them. Is princess charlotte cheekier than prince george? No, they're about as cheeky as each other. They're very cheeky. And does prince george, like, do the floss? No, charlotte can floss. She can already floss at 4. Yeah. You don't want to see me floss. Catherine can floss, but I can't. It's like a really horrible film to watch me floss. If you lived in the bugingham palace, what bug would you be? What bug would I be? Maybe a millipede. Have loads of legs, loads of shoes. I've been completely blown away by how knowledgeable these children are. - What is it? - A rose beetle. It's a rose beetle. Very good knowledge. They really understand that without these insects, we lose so much. [ Indistinct talking ] Narrator: Making a home for bugs in their own backyard may be a small start. But it has massive implications. At the minute, we're in the middle of an extinction crisis. We have reporting that 40% of all insects across the globe could be extinct in the next few decades. I mean, that is catastrophic. The reasons for that are habitat loss and pollution, including pesticides and herbicides, which knock out, obviously, a lot of insects and the food for insects. That has implications right throughout the food chain because for the most part, everything eats insects... Birds, bats, lizards, hedgehogs. We also need insects, as well. So we've got in the u.K. 270 species of bee. As the kids were telling you, they're really, really important for pollination. So without them, you know, we don't have things like tomatoes. Bumble bees pollinate tomato crops. Narrator: The inspiration for elliott's idea came from an unlikely place... His school dinner. I started the eco emeralds because I saw that the ice cream had palm oil in. Palm oil makes me sad because it's destroying the monkeys' habitat because they're cutting down the trees just so a bunch of kids can eat a bowl of ice cream. Well, a tub with a plastic lid. Eabha: It was killing 25 orangutans a day when they cut down the trees, so I wanted to stop that and let animals live and be happy. It's not just orangutans that are in danger. It's everyone. - What have you got? - A worm. Narrator: Bugingham palace is just the beginning. You can dry your hands on the side there. Elliott and his mates believe we can all help insects. So they persuaded the entire school to scatter seeds to create natural habitats for bugs across liverpool's open spaces. Poppy: People plant flowers in their own garden, but, like, if we can start, like, planting more flowers in, like, the parks so, like, animals like caterpillars and bees and stuff can live in their natural habitat. Elliott: There's gonna be more bugs in there than what's usually in that park because it's a bit... Mm, dodgy. Barnes: It's an inner-city school here in anfield. A lot of families don't have gardens. There are very few green spaces. That kind of makes it all the more fantastic, really, these children wanting to do something for nature at large when their exposure to it is not great. William: It's important that their energy inspires the rest of us in positions that can do something to do something. That's the way I see it. I certainly don't want them to worry and have to fix it all, but we should be harnessing their energy and their passion for fixing this and helping them do that. Narrator: It'll be a few months before liverpool comes into bloom. But today prince william has one final duty to perform. Has it got a spot to go in the grass? Just any. Narrator: He declares bugingham palace officially open. [ Cheers and applause ] Whoo! ♪♪ Narrator: Prince william knows full well the importance of insects. At sandringham, they're trying out new ways to boost bug numbers. This is a bit of an experiment. As you can see, the trees are being planted in the field. Alongside that, you'll have either barley or wheat growing around it, as well. So it's mixing the two crops together, if you like. There's evidence that the insects and the invertebrates in the trees protect the crops against pests, thereby reducing the reliance on a lot of crops for pesticide. You can produce food and you can have an abundance of wildlife and invertebrates. And it's something my father particularly is very keen on. And ideally that is where more of the country should go with farming. We can't just say, "well, it's all for growing crops, and screw everything else." We've got to be mindful of that intrinsical balance. Hares a key species that are very, very affected by change. We've been very lucky. We've always kept a very healthy population of hares here. We're very wary. We don't want disease to creep in 'cause that will wipe them all out. And that's what it is. It's a balance.

This is deborah. - That's deborah there? - Come on deborah. Deborah, it's okay. Deborah. William: I like deborah a lot. I've never known a rhino be called deborah before. Now I've got george, charlotte, and now louis in my life. Your outlook does change. Man: And these two calves with the wrinkles are both deborah's calves. And that's why I had to do something. I had to get involved, because I really felt that by the time my children were 20, 25, at the rate that poaching was at, there may not have been another rhino in the wild and there probably wouldn't have been many elephants left at all. It really was that urgent and that critical. They are a prehistoric, odd-looking creature, but when you get to see their characters and you get to see the family bond they have with their mum, it does make you feel like you're watching a really close family unit. And the fact that they're under a sort of threat is really quite sad. Narrator: Rhino horn is smuggled from africa, much of it for alternative medicine, even though there's no evidence of it having any benefit at all. People might see them and think it's a big tank, big hulk of an animal with a big horn. But they are incredibly vulnerable. They have brilliant eyesight. And people will take advantage of that. And they want this horn, which is effectively nail. You know, that is all it is. It's fingernail. This is where the horn belongs... on a live rhino. That's where it should stay.

Uri-khob: It's a huge area. It's actually difficult. It's like searching for a needle in the desert. We've got very good evidence that the rhino is here. We found some fresh dung. This dung is very fresh, wet still. There's still lots of water in it. Maybe 45 minutes. Even dung beetles hasn't come yet. After two hours tracking in the desert heat, they get their reward. There he is. Finally. Just watch. - Big spray. - Yeah. Quickly, get the rhino before he goes. It's a cow, actually. It's not a bull, it's a cow. It's a once-in-a-lifetime moment. It looks very good. It's okay. Yeah. Here the poachers are successfully kept at bay by what amounts to a vast neighborhood-watch scheme. The local communities co-own the people's park, seeing living wildlife as a valuable resource for their future. William: The more we can do community conservation, the more the locals realize that if I have an elephant in my backyard, I can tolerate it every now and again causing a bit of trouble, but I know that it's gonna bring loads of money and tourism into the area. And then they start valuing it. And then they teach their children. And so on. Tjijahura: We stood up for the people's park for the sake of our children's future. You saw the merits in what was being done and you wanted to show your support? - Yes. - Good. That's why I care so much about illegal wildlife traders, 'cause you take that rhino out of there, you poach that elephant out of there, they're being robbed of their natural resources. What you've set up here in namibia is incredibly important. That is the best way to have wildlife thrive that the people thrive, too. Every single live rhino that you see is good news, but we don't want to see one anymore. We want to see hundreds. Narrator: Preventing poaching on the ground is just the first battle.

The jewel in the crown of this rich underwater ecosystem is maerl. Caillin: Maerl, it looks a lot like a coral, but it's actually an algae. It grows super slowly, one millimeter per year in slightly warmer waters, but in colder waters such as here, it can grow way slower. It's absolutely tiny but it's super beautiful. It's got this really kind of naturally vibrant pink color coming through it. It provides the nursery grounds for loads of species. The maerl creates such biodiversity that this is a fertile breeding ground for scallops. ♪♪ And that's a huge lure for industrial fishing dredges. ♪♪ Maia: When dredges come, they're like big rakes. They'll scrape up the entire seafloor clean off, and it can be filled with wildlife, and it wipes out entire habitats. ♪♪ When you dredge the scallops, you will completely damage everything else that's there. It can be so devastating. With maerl especially, that could have taken decades to grow and takes minutes to destroy. And it's all for a few quid. We decided that we should take action.

So we're sitting at the moment in ullapool harbor. You know, during, obviously, this covid outbreak, how has it affected your business and you doing the diving? Has it had impact on the demand for scallop? See, with the shutting of all the hotels and local restaurants and everything else, we couldn't sell anything locally. We had scallops going down to london and eastgate market. And then that city shut. It's a massive impact. It stopped dead, basically. I know billingsgate fish market quite well, andy, 'cause they forced me to eat jellified eel at 5:00 a.M. One morning when I went down there. Ooh, nice. I can tell you, it's not a pleasant experience, that. Jellified eel at any time of the day is bad, let alone at 5:00 a.M., with a hangover I think I had at the time when I was a bit younger. But, andy, will the market better pick up for you guys again? I see it as a bit of a blip, this. It will come back. And we gave scallops away to the ullapool sea savers to pass around the village.

With this little team on board, you can't go far wrong, can you? William: And I hope I can come up soon and see you guys. Yeah, you need to come snorkeling. I'm reluctant to get in a wet suit, but I will do that if I have to. [ laughter ] Thank you. [ Bird squawking ] Narrator: As an island nation, the ocean has shaped britain's landscape, but as climate change warms our world and melts the polar ice caps, much of the coast is at risk. And at sandringham, prince william can see the rising tide right before his eyes. William: We are right on the coast. So we've got the marshland out here, the wash. We've seen the water level on this bank up here within a millimeter or two of coming over the top of the bank, and you suddenly realize, you know, those extreme events are gonna happen more and more in the future. And also how low-lying particularly this part of east anglia all is. It could really very drastically change. We'll lose the whole lot, and it'll sweep in and stay. You know, when sea levels rise, it will stay. It will not go back out again like everyone thinks. It would, you know, be a flood. And you'll lose the wildlife habitats here. You'd lose the farm and you'd lose the communities. It's in everyone's interests that we protect these sorts of areas. We have to get on top of the climate change issue. Narrator: By the turn of the century, climate change is predicted to cause our oceans to rise by as much as two meters, and across the world, extreme weather and its impact are intensifying. [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Thunder crashing ] Every summer since 2015, fast-moving floods in pakistan have washed away himalayan villages and roads, leaving thousands of people cut off and homeless. Like a wall of water coming down? Yeah, you can see the boulders. So last year, the duke and duchess took a trip to see not just the devastation, but the source of the floods... ...Rapidly melting glaciers. When prince william first met catherine at st. Andrews university, he was studying geography. So climate change is a familiar subject. William: We are very lucky to be up here to see this. Nothing is more important right now than climate change and the environment. They're meeting dr. Furrukh bashir, a world-leading climatologist who's been studying how the glaciers are melting at record speed. Bashir: Over here in hindu kush, this area holds world's largest ice reserve outside polar region. We have got more than 2,700 kilometer cube of water in form of snow and ice. Narrator: Dr. Bashir is warning of a terrifying truth... That millions of people could soon see their taps run dry. Bashir: So majority of glaciers in pakistan are retreating. And they are retreating at alarmingly high rate, and global warming is responsible for that. And these glaciers provide drinking and irrigation water to 200 million people in pakistan. Narrator: It's not just pakistan. If the planet's glaciers continue to melt, a quarter of the world's population would lose access to freshwater. William: A lot of people in cities around the world are used to just turning the tap on and having instant water, forgetting, you know, this is where it comes from and this is how we have to manage it. This is where, you know... If this goes wrong up here, there goes all our water. Bashir: Very right. Because cities are expanding, and the natural availability of water is not good enough to sustain that big population. It takes the story, doesn't it, away from just being about the environment and climate change, but it takes it into people's homes, actually. This is about water. Yes, there is water... Yeah, exactly. It's about survival, isn't it? Survival, exactly, because that is their lifeline. Because these glaciers provide water in spring and summer period where we have no rainfall. Bashir: I heard that you are a geographer by training. William: Yeah, dr. Warren, my geography teacher, would be well impressed that I'm back at a glacier after all these years. We'd love to come and show our children environments like this. You can impress george with your geography knowledge. Finally my geography chat about terminal moraines is useful. I've been given ridicule about it for years, and now I can actually talk to professors about it. He's like, "oh, you know what a moraine is? That's good news." ♪♪ What is going on here is climate change, and 1.6 billion people depend on this freshwater. That is a huge amount of the world's population. Now, imagine if this goes. It's a huge environmental and humanitarian disaster, and yet we still don't seem to be picking up the pace and understanding it quick enough. Narrator: In the fight against climate change, forests are our greatest natural ally. They draw carbon from the air and lock it into wood. But across the world, a forest the size of the u.K. Is lost every year. ♪♪ At sandringham, the estate safeguards a number of magnificent ancient trees. William: It's got lots of trees. No, I loved climbing trees when I was younger and used to muck around in the trees, and my father used to get very upset, us climbing trees and falling out of them. Narrator: Prince william's own tree-climbing days may be behind him, but tree specialist natural history cameraman james aldred is here to help him understand how vital these ancient trees are in the fight against climate change. It is an absolute treat to be climbing a tree like this. I don't think that... Well, I'd be surprised if anyone's had the opportunity to climb this tree ever before. But I think that's the beauty of an estate like sandringham. It's clearly a refuge for trees like this. This was planted in the reign of elizabeth I, and there's something quite fitting about that. This tree is hard to beat. This is king of the wood, really. Absolutely amazing. Hello, james. Good morning. [ Both laugh ] Make yourself at home. - How you doing? - Good, thanks. I think this is probably about 400 years old, something like that. 400. Really? Yeah, yeah. How can you tell? Overall, it's the sheer size. This is at least 6 or 7 meters around, and as a general rule of thumb, that means sort of 400, 450 years. It's amazing, isn't it? Yeah. It is absolutely phenomenal. They're such fantastic specimens. Absolutely. Narrator: For the u.K. To become carbon-neutral, scientists say we'll need to plant 1.5 billion new trees by 2050. But just as urgent is the need to conserve the trees we already have. Aldred: As trees grow older, they grow faster, and these days of global warming, where excessive carbon in the atmosphere is a big issue, what better way than to leave the big ancient trees standing and just let them do what they've evolved to do over millions of years? And you hear this a lot with property developers. They might need to remove a tree like this, but they say, "it's okay 'cause we'll plant half a dozen others in its place." Well, the reality is that won't be any good for half a millennia. Yeah, take a while for it to get to the same level. Yeah. Yeah. More planting, the better, I guess. But ultimately, trees are best left where they are. Agreed. Incredible, aren't they? Absolutely phenomenal. William: If we want people to protect nature, they've got to experience it. They've got to value it. Just being outside, being amongst it, and realizing all the special treasures that are there. ♪♪ [ birds chirping ] ♪♪ Narrator: With a growing population, experiencing nature may get much harder. Because by 2050, over 2/3 of children will grow up in cities. Mooney: That's a reed warbler. - There? - Yeah. Saying hello. Such a cool noise. ♪♪ One solution is to bring the wild into our cities. ♪♪ So reed warblers come all the way from africa to summer in hackney. For the community here gonna be looking onto this green space, I bet you ask everyone up there, they love the fact they can see this. Oh, god, like, who wouldn't want a kingfisher darting past their kitchen windows? Fantastic. Narrator: 10 years ago, david mooney gave up his career as a science teacher to help give this 11-acre london reservoir a new lease of life. With lots of amazing local people, volunteers, we planted reed beds, planted woodland, planted hedgerows, established wildflower meadows. Mooney: From a barren, depressing reservoir with fences, "keep out" signs, and barbed wire, we've literally wilded a corner of hackney. It's taken less than 10 years for dragonflies to be hunting. The kingfishers are now breeding. That's incredible. That's a huge turnaround. And if you look closely, emperor dragonflies. Really? In fact, can you see one just to your right? - Oh, there. Here. - There you go. Brilliant. Look at that. It's hovering nicely. - Yep. - Look at the size of him. Narrator: It's not just the wildlife drawn to this magical place. Woman: I live on the estate here on woodberry down. My little one, she's autistic. So she's got no sense of danger. Here, she can come and just be free. This is like a bit of sanctuary. My granddaughter loves coming here. We love looking at the birds. Do you see the birds? Look at the birds. Wow. Yeah. ♪♪ Mooney: The moment you bring kids into a wild space like this here at woodberry wetlands, you see their eyes light up. And that connection with the natural world is something that leaves a mark on them. Birds. Woman: It's important to them to see things they would normally see. I get to write down the things I've seen, and then I can, like, research them. Mooney: So this is called a eurasian reed warbler. If we put a unique number onto their leg, we can learn about their migrations. So if you want to, I'll let you release this bird. Yeah. So bottom hand first or top hand first? Top hand first. If you just gently grab it around its neck. Yeah, lovely. There you are. That's probably the first-ever reed warbler you've handled. It is. Absolutely. Do I just literally just... Yeah, just open your hand. It'll fly off into the weed bed, yeah. Okay, he's ready to go. Yeah. Okay. There we are. Going back to its chicks now. Narrator: Recently, wild places like these have become much more than oases for birdlife. They've become lifelines for us all. ♪♪ 2020 has been an extraordinary year, one that nobody could have predicted. William: I've been very lucky that through the lockdown, I've been here, surrounded by wildlife. I can't talk about coronavirus without mentioning about how many people sadly lost their lives and how terrible and sad that all is. But I think the tiny little ray of light, if there's any ray of light from this, is that it allows us to take stock and to refocus our priorities. I've been really heartened by what I've been hearing from other people and how they've started to appreciate nature and experience it and see all the things that they never thought they would. The details come out because they have the time. Narrator: Lockdown has given prince william time to reflect on his journey. Is it really possible for local action to have global impact? In scotland, the ullapool sea savers aren't stopping their campaign to protect marine life anytime soon. You've got to start small, 'cause, like, rome wasn't built in a day. So you've got to start small, and then you can slowly work your way bigger and bigger and bigger. To find out how marine protected areas can be expanded across the planet, the duke is seeking expert advice... - Callum, hello. - Hello. ...From marine biologist professor callum roberts. William: For me, this example really shows that local communities coming together can have an impact. Roberts: This is exactly true. What we need to do now is to scale up those efforts across the world so that they can turn around the state of the ocean as a whole. What the science tells us is that we need to be covering the ocean with something like 30% coverage of marine protected areas, and then the oceans themselves will rebuild and recover. So this new kind of youthquake and interest in the environment will gradually overtake the more destructive ways of using the environment. I think people will look back and wonder what the hell we were doing to be destroying things just for short-term gain rather than trying to manage them in a way which is gonna produce long-term benefit. Narrator: In liverpool, the eco emeralds youthquake is producing shock waves of its own. Before lockdown, prince william saw bugingham palace taking shape. We gonna get some bees in there this summer, do you think? Yeah! That'd be good if you get some bees. Narrator: Now the children's urban wildflower meadows are erupting into color. ♪♪ Elliott: It makes me really happy because this park wasn't very nice. But now it's bright and colorful. Usually when I came, I just saw seagulls eating leftover takeaway. I think it's amazing because we can see loads of bees, like, loads and loads and loads and loads. And one of our main goal to protect the bees, so it's very good. That means that we're doing something right. Narrator: Thanks to the power of a social-media campaign, the eco emeralds' message is blossoming nationwide. Barnes: Their idea of backyard nature is saying it doesn't matter where you live. You can still do something which is gonna impact on your environment and raise that awareness. Narrator: There are now over 10,000 backyard nature guardians across the country... ...Among them prince george, princess charlotte, and prince louis. Byrne: We know in the u.K., there's about 15 million gardens, and that is equivalent of a national park the size of dartmoor. If every garden in the u.K. Took on board backyard nature and made it a haven for wildlife, that would be immense. They'd be on their way to restoring wildlife in the u.K. Elliott: Anything's possible as long as you put your mind to it because if the eco emeralds didn't put their minds to it, then this wouldn't have happened. William: This project is a prime example of what everyone can do up and down the country. It harnesses the enthusiasm and the determination of the younger generation to really tackle and be involved in some of these big environmental issues. As you can see, the poppies have come through. This field was absolutely bright red earlier on in the season. You got pretty much every color in the rainbow, and it's wonderful, the sea of color, the diversity. And that's what it is. It's about creating that diversity. When I come for walks along here with the children, you really notice on a warm day just the vast amount of insects that are here and the birds coming and going, taking the insects off the field. So nice. Narrator: Two years ago, prince william made it his personal mission to find ways to protect the natural world for future generations. William: This is where the horn belongs. That's where it should stay. William: Imagine if this goes. It's a huge environmental and humanitarian disaster. Narrator: He's seen the vital importance of preserving what we have left... This tree will keep giving back to this environment here for hundreds and hundreds of years. ...And how effective communities can be at pulling together to get things done. We've literally wilded a corner of hackney. Do you see the birds? Look at the birds. Wow. A recognized face. Sir david's wise words have rung true. Kids know an awful lot now about ecology and about what's happening to the world. William: Why are bees so important? Because, like... They create 75% of our food chain. Narrator: Young people are spearheading the action we need, and their voice has grown louder, spurred on by the most famous of them. William: What greta's done is really quite interesting. People were desperate for someone to come along. Thank goodness there's somebody there with a young voice being active. Narrator: But prince william has discovered plenty more unsung heroes and heroines. You guys should be so proud of yourselves and what you've done, and I can see you two are a force for good that no one's gonna mess with. - Thank you. - So much. These young children doing these bug palaces in liverpool, the girls up in ullapool saving their coast, I owe it to them to help their voices be heard. We are the generation who are gonna inherit this planet. It's really, really vital that we are the ones who make some of the decisions. That generational gap has to be bridged somehow so the older political leaders understand that the younger generation mean business. They want their futures protected. I feel it is my duty and our collective responsibility to leave our planet in a stronger position for our children. Thank you. Adults should stop just watching it happen and help us 'cause they've done it all. We've seen from coronavirus organizations mobilize themselves like something we've never seen before...

These are big deals. If we can provide the same motivation with the environment, we have truly turned a corner.
