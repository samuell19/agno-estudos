Maybe next time, they won't wait so long. Joseph, don't you have a wedding to get back to? Right? Right. What are you waiting for, a special invitation? Hi, Leo. Hi, Leo. Well, to tell you the truth, at first I was a little upset. But, I mean, I arrived here tonight expecting to join in the festive occasion, my main man's wedding. Get a chance to spend a little time with you fellows, you know, off the clock, as it were. But when I arrive, I go through the club, and I see the faces of friends, family, and guests, and they're all looking pretty upset. Why? Because the man of the hour is missing. I know, Leo. I'm sorry. We got a call from this fucking biker-- Yeah, yeah, I know; Joey told me all about it. And that's another thing that makes me pretty crunchy. He tells me that these guys have been calling three or four times over the past couple of weeks, and I don't know a thing about it. Listen, I don't mind you going out to deliver a message, but it does upset me that you wait until your wedding night to go take care of this stuff. I mean, come on, Hooker. As a result, you got two mothers upstairs very upset, not to mention a new bride. Now, that's no way to start out your marriage, buddy. I know, Leo; you're absolutely right. I'd like to get back to the wedding as soon as possible. Dennis, make us a few drinks, will you? Yeah, sure, Leo. Let's get down to the business first. I understand you ran into the gambler. What happened with that? He paid. What do you mean, he paid? Oh, Mike talked to the guy, and he paid. Really? How much? Just about 30. Plus, we got his car, a brand-new Mercedes, which is being liquidated at Sanchez as we speak. I drove it. Yeah, Dennis drove. Well, don't just sit there. Tell me all about it. All right, we waited for him outside. He was in the 2-2 Club playing fucking craps. So anyway, when he comes outside, Mike backs the guy in the corner in the shadows, trips him on his ass, and sticks a gun in his face. He does one of these numbers, right? And let me tell you, Leo, this guy changed his attitude real quick, and I got his money. And let me tell you this: this guy was deathly scared too. That true, Mike? Pretty close, Leo, but there's one small problem. Hmm? Leo, when were inside the joint, the cardroom, this guy, CJ, dropped the Fat Man's name. Tried to say the cardroom was Tommy's place. Mmm. What'd the manager say? Chuckie? I talked to him afterwards. He said it was a bunch of bullshit, but I think he was lying. I think that fucker's been paying rents. Think Tommy shook him down? Maybe. What do you think we should do, Leo? Same thing you'd do to anybody else: double his rent. See what he does. If he complains-- tell him to kiss your fucking ass. If he don't, all the better, more money for us. That's right; more money for us. More money for us. Ooh-whee. Speaking of more money, Leo, I was just wondering-- Shot, don't. Hooker, relax. We just made a lot of money today, huh? Exactly how much money did we make? Shot, I'm telling you, don't. $50,000. That's how much we made. I'll drink to that. To $50,000. Here. To $50,000. Oh, shit, man. Oh, man, I gotta tell you, Leo, I can't believe how dumb, dumb, dumb I was to loan out your money. I can't believe that either. But at least I got it back, all of it, including the $10,000 in juice. Boy, oh, boy, at least that is pretty smart, huh? And since I got back all of your money, Leo, and the juice, I was just wondering, and I don't want to speak for the rest of the crew, but I was just wondering if maybe, just maybe we could split the extra profit over and above the $30,000. That's like, mmm, 20 grand, depending on what we get for the car, right? 'Cause I gotta tell you, Leo, I am so fucking broke right now that I don't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. I mean, I am so fucking broke that I am about to go belly up, good-bye. So what do you say, Leo? Well, I don't know. Dennis, what do you think I should do? I don't know, Leo. Of course you don't. If you knew, you'd be the one wearing a $2,000 suit, right? Yeah, you know, come to think of it, I change my mind. I think that Shot's got a great idea here. Yeah, I like it. Thank you. So, Dennis, what do you think now? What do you think of Shot's idea now? I like it. Hey, hey, Dennis likes Shot's idea. Hooker, what do you think of Shot's idea? Whatever you say, Leo. Whatever I say? I love that. Whatever I say. Well, you know what I say? I think you should get your wife on the phone. Tell her to open her purse and come on down! Because Shot is giving away Leo's money. And since we're on the subject of Leo's money, why don't we review Leo's rules about Leo's money? Dennis, what's Leo's rule number one about Leo's money? It's, um-- Well? Never ask you for money. Never ask Leo for money. Hooker? What's Leo's rule number two about Leo's money? If you're thinking about-- If you're thinking about breaking rule number one. That's right. If you're thinking about breaking Leo's rule number one, leave the room now. Now, for the all point bonus round-- maestro, can I get a drumroll, please? What is Leo's rule number three? ♪ Da-da. Tick-tick-tick-tick- tick-tick-tick-tick-tick. Tick!crash! There is no rule number three. That's right, Shot. There is no rule number three. So now that we're all clear about Leo's rules regarding Leo's money, what the fuck were you thinking about when you loaned that gambler my money? Did I tell you to do that? Did anyone tell you to do that? You know, all I ever hear from you, Shot, is, "I'm so fucking broke, kapaya. "I'm about to go belly up, kapaya. "I don't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Kapaya, kapaya, kapaya!" I got something for your fucking ass. Kapaya, kapaya, kapaya! Now, look, you know, I got a new bitch for you. Kapaya! You son of a bitch. You know, I finally figured out what that word "kapaya" means. Now, look. I got one suggestion for you. Get the fuck out of here! Now, gentlemen, if there isn't any other personal business we have to take care of, I would like you all to clean yourselves up, put on a fresh shirt and tie, and let's return to the wedding, where the family and guests are waiting for you. Leo, what about that business about Tommy? It's not the first time we've heard that. You know, this guy's getting around. It won't be long before we have problems collecting from everybody. It's just a matter of time. Hooker, don't be impatient, and don't be fearful. Folk make bad decisions when they're fearful. Right, Shotty? Kapaya! Huh! Come on.

It would be a shame if Leo took a bullet to the head and died, wouldn't it? This is kind of fun. I'm not going to hold my breath thinking about it. Thinking about what? Oh. Leo. Nothing; we were kind of goofing around. Would you like some breakfast, Leo? Oh, no, go ahead. I just had a hellacious game. I'm glad to see you guys are in such a jovial mood. Aren't we? Listen, I've been giving a lot of thought to what we talked about last week, and I agree. I want you guys to be able to make some real money. I want you all to be fat and happy. That's the way it ought to be. And after the next job, there'll be plenty to go around for everybody. Leo, what next job is that? The Fat Man. You guys are going to whack him. Whack him? How? You get him right outside of his restaurant on Ivar. Now, I've already taken care of his men on the inside. You can get him when he comes out-- tonight. Leo, you're talking about Joseph's, right? The place across from the hospital, right? You've got it, Shotty. So you make sure you get him good. With a fucking hospital across the street, he might make it if you don't kill him. Leo, are you serious about this? Now, you guys said you wanted to be able to make some real money, right? Well, here's your chance. We'll take over every place he's got. And there'll be no problem with narcotics, because nobody will have followed us. What about cops? I'll handle them myself; don't worry. We just have to take the Fat Man first. Well, Leo, how do we whack him right outside of his restaurant and get away with it? Yeah, we'd have to wear costumes or something, wouldn't we? And we'd need a car. Well, you got it, Mike. You'll need a car. So we're actually going to do it, Leo? We're going to whack him tonight? And you got to do it fast. You get him while he's not looking for it. So we're doing it. Mike? Yeah. Shot? Fuck, yeah. Dennis? Dennis? Yeah, I'm going to do it if you guys are. Good. So... any questions? Good. So I'll see you guys back here tonight. Yeah, and we'll have a real celebration. Kapaya! See you, Leo. Mike-- Shh. Okay. Mike, you think Leo's full of shit? He's not only full of shit about the money; this is just one more step in his master plan. What master plan? It's simple. Leo gets us to get rid of the Fat Man, and he gets everything. What's wrong with that? Loose ends. Moment we take out that fat bastard, we become a liability, just like Ray-Ray became a liability. So we're taking them both out? What about Joey? Yeah, what about Joey? We'll talk to him when he gets back. He'll be fine. clank! What about the shots? I mean, there's no traffic at that hour. Someone might hear the noise. Joey, you can't hear shit in his place, and you know it. The place is practically soundproof. Well, who's going to pull the trigger on Leo? He is. Who? Him? Me? Wait a minute. Mike, why me? Wait a minute; why him? Right. Leo trusts him. He can get behind him, pop him in the head, and he'll never see it coming. That's right, Hooker. That's right. He'll never see it coming from you. Well, can you do it, Hooker? Can you do it? Yes! Yes, I can do it. I have to. We can't end up like Ray-Ray, right? That's right. We cannot end up like Ray-Ray. What about Dennis? What about Dennis? Dennis, are you going to be able to handle this? Guys, I can do this. He's backup. He'll be in a bar with you and Shot. And what are you doing, Mike? What are you going to do? I'm Hooker's backup. Okay, wait a minute; let me get this straight. Okay, Mike, uh, okay, Hooker-- Hooker is going after Leo. You're backing him up, is that right? Uh-huh. Okay, then me and Shot are going after-- Sam and Nick. Sam and Nick. And, Dennis, you're going to back us up? Is that right, Mike? Correct. So I'm in here with you and Hooker. No, Dennis, you're in the bar with Joey and Shot. All right, I got it. ♪ 'Cause I can't help myself. ♪ Okay?

Like you only smart. No, really; what's he look like? He's big, about 50, 55. Good-looking guy too. Heavy, but not bad-looking. That's not how I remember him. Last time I saw the guy, he was pretty thin, pretty fit. The Fat Man? Yeah, the Fat Man, kind of looked like-- what's that guy's name, Italian, the actor? He's an opera singer too. Paul Sorvino; Big Porter from Goodfellas. Yeah, but not quite as heavy. You mean he looks like him but thinner. You are both wrong. Tommy Barnett's fat as a pig. He looks like Brando on a high-sodium diet. That's bullshit, Shot. He looks more like Sorvino than he does Brando. You want to bet? I sat right the fuck across from the guy in a restaurant not more than a month ago. I was this close to this guy, like from the front of the hood to here. They had to pull the table out every time he wanted to get up. Okay, here we go. That him? Uh... Come on. That one guy's pretty fat. I can't tell. I thought you sat across from the guy. Is that him or not, Shot? Uh... Well? No, that's not him. He doesn't drive a Lexus. That's not a Lexus, Shot; that's a Mercedes. What? No, that's still not him. That guy is way too young and too thin. You sat right across from the fucking guy. You can't tell? Kiss my ass, okay? So when do we do Leo? As soon as we get back, Dennis. I never really did like him. Dennis, who cares? Shut your fucking trap. Guys, that's him right there. Yep, that's him, the second guy back! You're sure? I'm positive. Hooker, start the car. All right, man, I'm starting the fucking car. Oh, shit. Now look at the fucking traffic. We're not going to get across. Goddamn traffic. Dennis, get out of this car, and tell these fucking people to move. Dennis, stay put, and pull that fucking beanie. That's him! I'm telling you guys, that's him! Goddamn traffic. Oh, fuck! Wait; wait; wait. Wait; he's coming back. He's coming back; he's coming back. Here it is, guys. Ahh!crash! Ah. Mr. Barnett's hit! Jesus. Someone call 911! Hurry! Back the car up. Put it in reverse, Hooker. Right, right. At approximately 10:35 this evening, reputed crime boss Tommy Barnett of Detroit was run down outside his own swank restaurant here on Ivar. Details are sketchy at this time, and police are keeping a tight control on information. But rumor has it that the driver of the car and passengers were rival gangsters. They sped off in a car, and nobody knows exactly where they went. Well, the-- When I heard the call over the police radio, I knew right then that Michael and the crew had done the hit on Barnett. Who else would make the move on Leo's main rival? A quick call to the club was the clincher. Yeah, hello? I want to talk to Michael. Michael who? Michael Moore. I don't know any Michael Moore. Listen up, asshole. I want to talk to Michael Moore right now. Look, I don't give a fuck who you want to talk to. I don't know any Michael Moore. Try another name. All right, Joey. Try this: if I don't talk to that motherfucker tonight, you tell him Billy said he's a dead man. You got that? Just wait a minute. Joey's nervousness gave it away. He was covering for Michael; there were no two ways about it. I warned Michael what would happen if he broke the rules. The time had come for him to find out. Who the fuck is Michael Moore? You give them two, okay? Okay, it's cool. Fair deal, huh? All right, we've got it all worked out. Hey, tiger. Get in the car, Squirrel. Get in the car, Squirrel! Just wait-- ahh! Ow! Ow! This is harassment! Ow! What do you got, huh? What are you doing? Don't move a fucking hand! He's got a gun. He's got a gun. Get over here! What's this? It's my breast. What's this? It's my breast! It's a lie. It's a lie! All right! It's a lie. Piece of shit. Breast, lie: semantics, officer-- Okay! Okay, I'm cool. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh-ho, oh-ho. What's this? Huh? Huh? It's my fucking gun. What do you think it is? Billy. That's one-- Ow! Huh? All right, give me the other. Give me the other. Two. Buckle my shoe. You're adorable. Get over here. I'm getting; I'm getting. Calm down. In the car. I'm getting. In the fucking car. You're so rough. What's your name? What's your name? Marilyn. It's another lie. Piece of shit. Right in my face. What the fuck is wrong with you, Billy? Every fucking time I see you this week, you're, like, turned into a fucking crazy man or something. And now this bullshit? What the fuck's with you, huh? You're going to replace my fucking dope too. That was everything I fucking had. You're going to deliver a message for me. I ain't gonna do shit for you. I can't even fucking walk. You can walk. No, I can't fucking walk. Then crawl. Billy. Hey, I always treat you like a gentleman? Yes. Huh? Yes! Then treat me like a gentleman. All right, cool. Billy, come on. I'll treat you like a gentleman. We're all gentlemen. Put the fucking gun down, man. Fuck. I mean, Billy-- All right. Who's the message to? Neil Richards. Oh, do not-- you're not serious. Billy, Billy, come on, man. How the fuck am I going to deliver a message to Neil Richards, huh? Just listen to me. All right. And you'll learn something. Okay. I want you to go into this club on Santa Monica Boulevard. You ask for this guy, uh... this guy Joey. You bend his ear for a while. You get cozy with him. Tell him you got a message from a cop. Okay. Let me ask you something, Billy-- just a hypothetical kind of-- I go in there, and I'm doing this ear bending, and we're cozy and everything. Let's just say he don't believe me. Then what? Then you're going to be in a world of hurt. All right. What's the message? You tell him Michael Moore... whacked down this guy, Ray-Ray. Michael Moore whacked down this guy, Ray-Ray. Well, anything else? Yeah. You get back to me as soon as it's done. Okay. Can I at least have my gun back? Oh. Well, who needs bullets, right, Billy? I have a right to my degeneracy. Yeah, you know? Of course you do, Billy. No one said you didn't, man. I'll call you as soon as I'm done, okay? All right, dig you later, Billy. Thomas Joseph Barnett was a man whose life spanned two worlds. His father wanted him to become the legitimate businessman that, in a sense, he had become. Mike, you think Leo's going to buy it? Well, he heard the radio. Rival street soldiers ran him down. Story at 11:00. What the fuck would you think? It's a slam dunk. You think they'll find out our names? Not unless you call Connie Chung and tell her. What kind of a fucking comment is that? Remember, nothing out of the ordinary. You go in; you say hi to Joey. Then you and Joey clear the place out for us. Dennis, you stay with him, okay? When you hear the shot from the room, you unload. You pop Leo's idiots. What if they're in the room? If they're in the room, Leo would ask them to leave. He's not gonna talk about a hit in front of them. You sure? Dennis, I'm sure. Mike, I don't like Dennis out there with Shot. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? 'Cause you're a crazy motherfucker, and I don't want my cousin shot. Yeah, well, maybe I'm the one that doesn't want to get shot. Look at my backup. Hey, fuck you, Shot. I can shoot as good as you-- Hey, hey, hey! Back off, all right? Hang on for a second, both of yous. What'd you say? Listen-- Fuck you. Son of a bitch. Hey, Shot. Hey, both of yous. We got a fucking plan to carry out, and we're going to do it.

When you hear the fucking shot-- We unload. Shoot till they're all dead. That's right. Dennis, you better not fuck up, or I will shoot you in the back. You know what, Shot? Maybe I'll shoot you in the back. Dennis! Dennis. Shut the fuck up. Hey, hey, hey, both of you. You want to shoot me in the back? Shut the fuck up, I said. You shut up. Shot-- keep out of this. You want to shoot me in the back? That's enough. We got a fucking job to do, so you-- Wait a fucking minute. You guys are fucking out of your minds. What the fuck you doing?

I was doing exactly what you asked me to do, until you sent in that fucking kid. Don't make me out to be the bad guy, Michael. I needed to hear it from you when that shit went down with Barnett. Then, right then. Mike, tell him! Tell him! I wasn't talking to him. What is wrong with you? Didn't you hear the news? He was run down by a car! Whose car was it, Michael? Beats the shit out of me. Call the cavalry and find out. I did. Nobody ID'd the car. They only remember four guys in ski masks. He was hit by a car. I'm trying to have a conversation here. God damn you, Billy. He's telling the truth. It wasn't us. You're telling me you had nothing to do with that hit-and-run? Absolutely nothing. Would you not have heard from me first? That was our deal, remember? Our deal was to get Leo. Mike, you made a deal with a cop? What am I dealing with, brain damage, here? Look, Billy, what are we arguing about? It isn't that bad. Barnett is gone. We can pin it on Leo, say he had an informant on the inside. Leo was going to whack Barnett, and now he's on the lam. You're bullshitting me, Michael. Leo's not on the lam. Leo is dead, or else we wouldn't be having this conversation. All right, so he's dead! So fucking what? So what? So what? You've got more, not less. Yeah. It's perfect. It's perfect. I'm sorry. Can we start over again? Don't move. My back is starting to hurt. Michael, this may be an inappropriate time, but I was trying to tell you at the wedding I need to hear from you. I was curious about what was going on with you all week. It's not the way it looks. Michael, are you aware there are two dead bodies in this room? I'm only responsible for one of them. It wasn't my fault. He made me do it. He made you do it? Yeah. Yeah. Michael... do you still love me? What kind of a question is that? Oh, boy. More games. You're a fucking liar, Michael! Yeah. The real question is... for $1 million in cash... snatch the pebble from my hand. Shaolin Temple reflexes. Michael. Michael? For $1 million, would you go for it? For $1 million in cash. You motherfucker! Ladies and gentlemen, you know, years ago, I used to fancy that I was a, you know, one of these cabaret singers. And I used to, you know, sit in with the band every once in a while. So I promised Hooker tonight that I would give him a special gift, and, well, this is it. So, Hooker, Vera, this is for you.
