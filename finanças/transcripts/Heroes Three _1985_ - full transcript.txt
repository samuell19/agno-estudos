OK, thanks [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [INTERPOSING VOICES] You're running down the street-- Uh-huh, and? [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] Hey, what's going on around here? Nothing. I just needed somewhere to stay. You keep out of this. Since when do you invite strangers to stay the night? What do you mean, stranger? He's no stranger. You sent him to us, remember? To teach Kung Fu-- nothing else. Come on, big brother. Nothing else happened. Don't you know that half of Hong Kong's after him? If they get him, they get you too. Don't you think I have enough to worry about? Hey, do us a favor, will you, lay off her. Listen, I don't want my sister involved in your mess. Man, I tried to reach you last night, but I couldn't get hold of you. So I turned to Mae. See? Why aren't you on your ship? Because I'm going to look for the guy who killed Jim. How?

Take it easy, patience, remember? Come on. Let's have a drink. Quick three beers. Come on. Gentlemen, please be cool. Relax. So what happened at the hotel, Max? When I got there, the guy was dead. Go on. Drink up. Peace. Mr. Winter wanted me to find this black guy. Why? I don't know. I'm told he's being held by Coffin Fang. Paid me to get him. Did you? No, you know Coffin Fang. Then he told me to go to the hotel. So you say. You lousy-- It was a strange coincidence, wasn't it, Max? Winter-- he set me up. That's a possibility. Come on. Let's split. You-- Hey, hey, I told you to take it easy. Come on. Come on. Let's split. Seems to me like the guy is lying. He didn't do it. I know Max. That's not his style. [INAUDIBLE] You better keep out of sight for awhile. That's taken care of. Don't worry. [INTERPOSING VOICES] But why? Why-- [SCREAMS] Charles? [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE],, Mr. Lim is a friend. I'm not so sure what kind of friend. After all, I had to the police I was coming. Can I play? Yes. Nobody really cares if the triads kill each other off. Actually, I'd rather prefer it that way myself. But now there's the American sailor. You think I killed him? He has something that you want. Did you find it? Maybe I can help you find it. - I'll offer you $100,000. - Whew. The money is good. Now suppose you tell me what I'm looking for. A piece of paper. And how will I recognize this piece of paper? This paper has [INAUDIBLE] Winter's signature. That's all I wanted to know. [MUSIC PLAYING] [YELLING] [INAUDIBLE] What are you going to do now? All that you're going to do is play a round with [INAUDIBLE].. We're all trying to forget about him. You know what I mean. I mean, what [INAUDIBLE] Oh, the Navy.

[INAUDIBLE] Just keep looking at it the whole time. [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, I really like this game. It's really good fun. Well, you should pick it up, because you got flare for it. I do? Yeah, with much practice. OK. I-- I just might pick it up, you know. Here. So, how are things with you with the Navy? I'm bored. I mean, I'm really bored of it. You're bored and you're in the Navy. Uh-huh. Why are you in the Navy in the first place? It's family tradition. You know, my two brothers are in the Navy. My father's in the Navy. So consequently-- Oh. [INAUDIBLE] And what about you? Tell me something about yourself. Well, I'm, um-- my parents died when I was very little. So it has always been Horatio and myself, you know what I mean. I guess it's always been big brother and me. Horatio, is a bit overprotective, isn't he? Well, he is, of course. He's my brother. He loves me a lot and he's a good guy. I really love him too. I guess so. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well done. Well done. See? You can do it. See? [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] Mae! [LAUGHING] Where is the document? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. [INAUDIBLE] document!

I told you to stay away from her, didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Who did this? I don't know, man. Some guy with a gold tooth. I don't know. I've never seen him before in my life. Gold tooth-- [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Charles, how could you do this to me, after all I've done for you for the last 15 years? Where the hell did you get these? Oh, Charles, please, I'm asking you for the last time, give her up. Finish with her. I'll do everything I can to help you be the new Tai-pan. Please? Let's start all over again. I'm not going to be the next Tai-pan. And we can't start all over again. I don't love you anymore. [MUSIC PLAYING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Dutch, let's check the backstage. [GUNSHOT] I'll do anything. I'll give you anything. Please, let me go. Bastard. All right. Just tie him up. Let's give him a taste of his own medicine. You know this what they did to poor Jim. But where's gold tooth Wang? Huh? I thought he'd be here. He's still got to be at the coffin shop. Let's check it out. [GROANING] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Come on. Come on, you bastard. Come on, you [INAUDIBLE] Cool it. Come on, you [INAUDIBLE] Cool it. You're going to waste him. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Uh-oh. I'll see you at the hospital. So you know what the document is. Once I faced Charles with your report, he told me everything. It's an irrevocable guarantee for $100 million dollars signed by Charles, committing the company. Even I cannot cancel it. I'm sorry, Tai-pan. So you should be. Have you found any further documentation? Unfortunately, nothing. But the answer is somewhere in this building. This building? How so? According the police reports, the American was killed with a bullet from a .38, Sir Miles. A .38? [INAUDIBLE] Don't bother. I've checked already. So, you're a murderer too, Charles? No, I swear it. Is this what you're looking for? [MUSIC PLAYING] Please, Mr. Lim, stay where you are. You killed Jim Burstall? Yes, I killed him. My god. See, I found that he had this paper. And I knew it would do Charles harm, and they wouldn't make him Tai-pan. And I-- Damn it. You didn't have to kill him. I know. It was a waste of time, because everything you were doing, you were doing for her. God damn you, Jenny Lin. Are you mad? [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Leaving? I'm sailing at midnight. On Chinese New Year's Eve? Mm-hmm. Could you take him to see the fireworks before he leaves? Yeah, sure. I want him to see the pretty side of Hong Kong. You're coming back again? I don't know, but I'll miss you. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] [INAUDIBLE] you're not there. When I feel [INAUDIBLE] through the [INAUDIBLE] my tears When I feel [INAUDIBLE] through the [INAUDIBLE] my tears [FIREWORKS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] You were no longer [INAUDIBLE] my side. Wish you were here. Time seems to stop somehow. Minutes seem like years. I drift like snow on the ground, reaching out for you. Reaching out for a dream. Everywhere the people stop and stare, laughing at my foolishness.
