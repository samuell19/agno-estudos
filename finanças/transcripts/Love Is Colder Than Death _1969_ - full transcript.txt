LOVE IS LOVE IS COLDER THAN DEATH for The sequence showing the drive along Landsberger Strasse was made available by Jean-Marie Straub. Give me one! You'll pay for that, you swine! You've had three previous convictions. Two for assault and one for procuring. Is that correct? Something like that. - It's exactly that. Our information is absolutely reliable. OK. You know why you are here? Very well, I'll tell you. The syndicate wants you to work for us. Do you smoke? The syndicate gets what it wants. You know that. In principle, it's all very simple. You do the work and you'll be paid regularly. How do you like the idea? You have a girlfriend. She's a very pretty girl, isn't she? Will you work for the syndicate? You will work for the syndicate. I work for myself and no one else. Raoul! I don't want to work for the syndicate. Watch your step, kid! They can be real mean here. Do you have a jail record? You don't want to talk? It's better that way. What's your name? Bruno. My name's Franz. Where are you from? A small provincial town. I'm from Munich. I have a girl there... I'm fond of her. Be careful, kid! They'll torture you. Here! Beat it! Have you thought the matter over? You'd have a secure future as an employee of the syndicate. The syndicate has the best lawyers, the best connections. I want to be free. Come on! Get up! They're letting me go today. I don't know what you plan to do when they let you go. You can come to us if you like. Can you memorize the address? Munich, 129 Hess Strasse. Munich, 129 Hess Strasse. I usually get some nice person sitting opposite me here. Would you like this apple? What are you thinking about? Sex? About the revolution. Good! You think so? How vulgar! You like that? Did you enjoy the apple? When I was 12 I smashed a vase over my father's head and killed him. At 16, I was the leader of a gang. One day we killed a guy who was sitting on a bench with a girl. We pissed down on him from a hill. He came up and gave us a dressing down. So we went for him, and he just keeled over. You know, with brass knuckles. And then he was dead. Just kicked the bucket. Can't see you now, Sweetie. Come back in half an hour. I've come about a guy called Franz. He doesn't live here anymore. He left quite a while back. Were you his girl? He's not my type- What was her name again? Joanna, you mean? Bastard! I'm looking for a girl called Joanna. Why Joanna? Why not me? Because she's the one I have to find. I saw her just now in a yellow dress. I've been watching you. You've been here quite a while now. You're alone, aren't you? I'm alone, too. Maybe we belong together? I'm looking for a girl called Joanna. I know a girl called Joanna. 129 Herz Strasse. Second floor, on the right. But don't say who told you... please. How did it go? We ought to find an apartment where we can stay... Have a child and some peace. A guy from the crime squad stopped me again today. What did he want? He wanted to know if you were still around. I'm looking for someone called Joanna. She lives here, I believe? - Yes, that's right. May I come in? There's another customer for you. Who is it? Bruno. Come in! Put your hands up! He's clean. It really is Bruno. Some Turkish guy was shot down. He had a few girls working the streets for him here. So his brother comes looking for revenge. And some rat tells the guy I'd killed his brother. Did you? The hell, I did! As if I'd kill a Turk! Anyway, I'm keeping off the streets till he's found the right guy. Joanna? Joanna's OK. He can't shoot you if you get him first... OK, kid! Darling! Can I help you? Do you have steel-rimmed glasses? Steel-rimmed glasses! - I don't know. Are these any good? - I'm not sure... They look good. Would you serve me, please? - Sorry, what did you want? Just to ask whether you have steel-rimmed glasses. I don't know... Would you wait your turn? The lady just wanted... - It's OK. I'm looking for round glasses like the cop in Psycho had. The guy who finds Janet Leigh's car. Do you know what I mean? We don't have round glasses. - Very poor service. I shall complain. I have only one pair of hands! The steel-rimmed glasses! - Yes. If you don't have round glasses, what else can you show me, darling? We don't have such a big selection. We're a department store. Thanks a lot. Another time maybe. Just a moment! Hold it! You know very well you can't smoke in a department store. That's right! See to it they keep order here! I have a gun license. For what type? Close the door! An Israeli sub-machine gun. The only machine gun I have is a very fine dummy. Let's have a look! This here. It's much less expensive, of course. But it sits beautifully in the hand. Do you have a revolver? I'm out of Walther PKKs at the moment. Ammunition? Thank you. Why have you taken off your glasses? He doesn't turn me on Physically. Honestly! What was that for? Because you laughed at Bruno, and Bruno's my friend. And what about me? - You? You love me anyway. Yes, please? Coffee! - OK. What would you like? - A coffee. And for you? - Coffee. I'm the guy you're looking for. Is that your car parked back there? Which one? The American one. The Ford Mustang or whatever. Yeah. Can I see your papers? Why? Cut out the funny questions! Will you show me your papers or...? Look, I could understand you perfectly... It's quite simple. A rival gets murdered... His brother turns up to avenge his death. But someone tips him off that you're the killer. So he comes looking for you. You're afraid to leave your hideout. After a while, you've had enough, and you think: before he gets you, you'll get him. Just imagine: you shoot him... and not just once. And now you can go out again. And you get arrested. It's a nice story. Nothing out of the ordinary. Sure, things like that are bound to happen. You might even be acquitted. Acting in self-defense... If it weren't for the girl, Erika Rohmer. Pretty girl, 19 years old. Still had a lot to expect from life. OK... You had to get rid of the Turk. I can see that. But why did you have to kill the girl? I have nothing to do with it. OK. I'm saving up the best things for later. How's Joanna? She's fine. And business? Is that fine, too? We've gone straight. Apart from two little murders. Sure. How do you make a living? We get by. OK, where were you last night? What time? Let's say around six. At six?... I was in bed. Alone? Was I ever alone in bed? In jail, you were. Apart from in jail, that's true. So who were you with? I'm a gentleman. Oh, yes? OK, let's start again at the beginning. We have plenty of time for you. 24 hours. Not a minute longer. The police are holding him because of the Turk. They have to release him by 10 tomorrow morning if he doesn't confess. He can't take a lot. The same questions over and over again. "Where were you yesterday at six?" "Who were you in bed with?" "Why did you shoot the waitress?" "Where did you hide the gun?" Didn't they come to the apartment? It was pretty risky to wait in the car outside the police station. Is that it? How would you like it? In mark coins? Good, huh? Very clean, the bank. When? Tomorrow. The biggest amount of cash is there on Fridays. We'll go our separate ways tomorrow and fend for ourselves for a while. Each of us will take a small amount of the cash. The rest will be hidden. We'll meet again in a few months when the heat's off. Who is it? Open the door, Hanna! Hurry up! A customer. Open the door! There are two others here! And one of them has a gun! I'll get rid of him. I spoke on the phone with Mr. Strauss. His orders are to get rid of the girl. It's to be done tomorrow. If you fire first we can take advantage of the confusion. And the weapon? Tomorrow. In the black CitroÃ«n. OK. At 4:30. Make sure you hit her properly! See you in Greece! Bavarian State Bank Still too many people. Where's Joanna? - She's buying cigarettes. Buying cigarettes. Why aren't there any here? I asked for them specially. But I haven't seen any. Where is she? She'll be here in a minute. Put your hands up! I have a machine gun! Don't move, or we'll shoot! Hands up! Is he dead? Yes. Damn it! They're on our tail. Open the door and throw him out! He's dead. Help me move him aside! I called the police. Whore! Subtitles: Peter + Waltraut Green
