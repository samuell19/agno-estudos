(biker chuckling) Why don't you leave us alone? You leave us alone. - All right, outta time. In fact, I'll make you a deal. We got one of your men here. - Don't need no mountain pig. - You get on your bike, ride outta town and stay out and I let him go in a couple of days. - You can have him. We don't want him anyway. That filthy son of a bitch, look at him. He so ugly, he can't even cry, man. You keep him then, man. - Come on, out. - We don't want him. That's okay. He's all right.

(laughs) - You remember the little talk we had with 'em the other night? - Oh yeah. I made a deal, didn't I? - 'Kay, what's the damage? - Two days, wasn't it? - Mm-hmm. - That'll be $1.95. - Old Shank here'll take care of it. (smooth country music) - Okay.

(rhythmic drum music) (crowd chattering) - All right, get on that thing and get outta town. We don't want your kind around here. Go on. (pedal clacking) - Christ. Man, I told you you shoulda let me start it every day. - This is a jail, not a service station. - Man, it ain't gonna start. Been sittin' idle too long. - See that he gets outta town. - Yes, sir. (pedal clanking) What's the matter with it? - Age. - There somebody you can call? - Yeah, I guess I could call somebody. - Use the phone inside. - Hold this a minute for me, Shank. I'm gonna show you these shells. - Hey, ain't that the Sheriff's daughter? - Yeah, that's her all right. Pretty little thing. (Shank laughing) Wish I was about five years younger. - Hell, gimme 20. She's jailbait. Oh, come on. Get in. We gotta go. (laughs) (smooth rock music) - Like it? - Uh-huh. It's really nice. - What're you doing here? Get along home. Go on! And don't push your luck, boy. Get goin'. (pedal clanking) (engine puttering) Look, I'll give you just five minutes to get outta town. The county line's just two miles that way. Now if this thing won't start, you push it out.

It's not a silly question at all. - I'm sure it was feeling silly to worry about such thing, but it's always the fear at hand. - I assure you it's a common fear, but I can guarantee you that it's perfectly airtight and moisture-proof. - Oh thank you, Mr. Sparagus. It's just that I can't bear to think about all covered with the- (weeps) - Trust me, Madam. - Oh, I will. I know I can leave him in your hands. - My hands. Mrs. Rolf, perhaps this one might be even more suitable. Here's the guarantee. Why don't you read it?

Yeah, we'd like an estimate. - We got a friend who got dusted. - Dusted? - Yeah. - Yeah, dusted. You know, ripped up. Like blown away. - Well perhaps you should go to the public health department. You might find more suitable arrangements for your needs there. - Sir. (knocks) How much? - Are you related to the deceased? - Seed didn't have nobody but us. - Seed was our brother, man. - But he's gonna need some fixin'. - And I assure that there's been no violence involved with the police or- - Can you fix him? - Well you know, the private funeral and the arrangements can sometimes take a great deal of money. - All right, sure. Say $300. Would that be enough to cover it? - Well it's usually 500 for The Sky's the Limit, but I think we could make some arrangement. - Do everything right, yeah? He's down at central receiving. - Well will you please step into my office and we'll sign some papers? - I'll do that later. - Well what's the name of the deceased? - Seed, man. - Yeah, in your world, he's known as Howard Kimball. - Howard Kimball. - Their mother was Seed to us. - Oh yes.
