Head injuries, cracked the seventh and eighth rib resulting in pulmonary contusions. - Any responses to external stimuli? - No. - That's too bad. - Yeah, I think it took a little too long to get to her. - Doctor, the authorities are insisting on immediate evacuation now. We need to get going. Most of their wings have been vacated. - Okay, we'll be right there. - This storm is gonna be a bad one. - She come here with anyone? - No. She has ID.

(dramatic music) - No, no, no. No, I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. - I think an invasive method would be the best course of treatment. Are these your imaginary friends?

It's the meanest strongest one anyone's ever seen before. It's the T-Rex of hurricanes. It passed over a secret government test facility. - At Fort Miller. - It's done something or broken something. It's woken up this place. - He and I have been here before. - Like you started over. - Yeah, we've been here before. But most of the times we just... We've been separate. - Where am I? Where am I? (machine beeping) (dramatic music) - Hey, we can't let that girl die here. - It's too late for her it's not for you. - [Jen] He's right come on. - Hey, come on I think we gotta go this way. Just remember don't die here. - Oh, no, no, no, no not again. I can't make it out of here without him. - Come on we have to try. - We needed to leave together. - We will leave together. - No, me and Ryan. - What do you mean? - We came in together. We're supposed to leave together. We gotta go back and get him. - We have to go. - No, I've been through this before, okay, and I've escaped without him and sometimes he's escaped without me but we always end up back here. - Come on we have to go. (soft music) (thunder rumbling) (tense music) - No, it's too late. We have to keep going. (tense music) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) Shit. - Help me take this off. - Oh, you got it? - Yeah. - Go, go, go. Hey. Hey, what's wrong? - This is just... I can't this is just... It's just all too much. - Hey, it's okay. We're gonna make it out of here and we're gonna be home playing video games before you know it. - Video games. - Okay, so maybe I will. I was an only child and I work a lot. But maybe Ryan will come over and he'll bring the beer and pizza. - He seems like a good guy. - He's so handsome in his uniform don't you think? Hey.

(soft clicking) - What are you doing here? - I don't know I just remember waking up here. - When did you first get here? - I don't remember it could've been last night or-- - When the hurricane started. - I think so. So how did you get here? - I placed a woman into protective custody. She was at a party and witness to a big drug deal gone bad. That witness was Jen. On our way to the station we were in that pile up on the main road leading off the island. - I was in that too I think. Procedure dictates I'd have to have her medically cleared being in a accident while in my custody so I drove us here and-- - And. - That was four years ago. - Four years. - All I could figure is they were messing around with something at Fort Miller and this hurricane came through which just... It twisted up the hospital and it mixed up all these timelines together. (tense music) Go, go, go, go, go. (loud grunting) (voice over intercom muttering faintly) (tense music) (soft music) - [Operator] 911 what is you emergency? - [Operator] Code White standard division psychiatric ward message 113. - [Man] Amy Barrett, Amy Barrett it's over. - [Operator] Attention, attention.

It's Amy. - You were in that pile up on the main road leading off the island? - Yes, I mean I think so. - How many times? - I don't know what you mean. I can't remember the accident. - No, no, no how many times? - I don't know. - Well, you've been here before you've seen this before, right? - Yeah, but I don't know what's going on. - And they haven't gotten you yet. You haven't died yet? - No, I keep waking up in my room. They haven't gotten me yet. - That's the eye. The eye of the hurricane it keeps recycling you back in. But you haven't died yet. - No. - Okay, okay, okay. - Why what happens? - If you die Amy none of us will ever be able to escape. - [Operator] Attention, attention please proceed. - This way. - Where are we going? - I either have to get you out or I have to find Jen. - I don't understand. - Well Jen and I came in together so we have to leave together. But you came in by yourself so you can leave by yourself. It's conservation of energy or something. Talk was that the hurricane damaged the quantum particle lab at Fort Miller. They were experimenting and manipulating paradoxical time anomalies. Nothing's in a linear progression anymore. The timeline it can spit you out whenever it wants to. You can wake up and it could be next year. It could be two days ago. You can just stay in this hospital forever. (dramatic music) - Now give me your elephant. - No, please no. I need him. (loud crying) (electricity whirling) - Let's go. - Now just lay still. Oh, sorry cold right? My you have a healthy heart. Let's take a look. (tense music) - [Operator] Code White standard division psychiatric ward message 113. (tense music) - No. Smart move you should come work for the sheriff's office. Do you have the numbers we gotta get out before the hurricane passes by. - What numbers? - The numbers. I've been waiting years for this. I need those numbers. - What? - Have you seen any numbers like over again? - My room number 235. - 235, 235. - Wait, wait 133, 132. - 133, 132 those are the numbers inside the rooms in the psych ward they just put Jen and me in. - That's all that I know. - We've been here a long time we've been trapped. The only way we can get out of here and escape is we gotta get those numbers. It has to do with the energy or something. It's gotta have something to do with those numbers. Hey, are you alright? - I feel really weird. - It's almost your time again. You're resettling. Only it's gonna be less time they get you when you reset. You gotta get out before the storm hits. - What's happening? - You're restarting, you're speeding up. You're running out of time before each reset back into the loop. You have to get out before the storm comes. (dramatic music) - [Operator] 911 what is your emergency? - My name's Amy Barrett. I'm about to be in a accident. I'm trapped with a sheriff's deputy. - [Operator] Ma'am, can you give me your location? Ma'am. - Yeah, not again, not again. (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) Jen, oh my god. - You're not one of them. I need the numbers, the room number. I need the number, I need the number. The room number there's a room number here. - I told Ryan. I told Ryan everything I know. - Ryan. You've seen my Ryan. (dramatic music) How is he? Is he okay? It's been so long. - He's looking for you. - Next time you see him will you tell him will you tell him, will you tell him that I love him could you tell me that? Could you? - Tell him yourself. Come on. Let's get out of here. - I can't wait to see him. I just want him to hold me just for a little while. - We'll find him together, okay. - Maybe he'll call. - Come on we gotta keep moving. (telephone ringing) (tense tone) - [Ryan] Jen, I'm sorry I brought you here. Just keep trying until we get it right. Don't give up. I won't give up on you. I love you, Jen. Jen, I love you. - [Operator] 911 what is your emergency? - Hi, my name's Amy Barrett. I'm at Bay General. I am trapped inside with a sheriff deputy named Ryan and a woman named Jen. We can't get out please send someone. (soft beeping tone) - [Operator] Code White standard division psychiatric ward message 113. (tense music) - Calm down my child. You are safe here. - Amy don't listen to him. - Don't listen to that spirit. Hey, let's go to the chapel. - Amy, you can't trust him. - You'll be safe there. (priest speaking in foreign language) (tense music) (telephone ringing) - Jen. - Get down, get down. - Jen, I'm so sorry Jen. - [Jen] I love you Ryan. - Where are you? - [Jen] I don't know. - Please baby just tell me where you are. - [Jen] I'm all alone. - What room number do you see? - [Jen] I'm scared, Ryan. - Don't be scared baby. Hey, you know what - What - I've got this bad ass muscle car. I've been restoring it. It's in my grandma's barn. When we get out of here, I'm gonna take you out on a date. - [Jen] It's a deal. No, no, no they're back. No, no, no. - Jen. - [Jen] Please come please, please hurry. - What is going on here? - I don't know this hurricane's opened up a portal or something. - I don't get it. - I don't know anymore it's like hell or something. - Yeah. - I've died over 600 times and each one is more horrific. - We gotta get out of here. - You know I figured that the only time that Jen and I could escape together is when we first come in together before either one of us even died. - Like the first time I saw the two of you in yours in the waiting room. - Yeah, that would've been the time to leave. I mean anyone how many times we've been back in that waiting room but each time we think it's the first. - So you don't know that you need to turn around and leave. - Yeah, exactly. God I fucking hate his place. - I keep waking up back here. There has to be something in this room. (cellphone ringing) - [Mom] Amy, I saw you called but didn't leave a message. I'm worried about you. I can't lose you like I lost your sister. Call me. - [Operator] Due to heavy call volume - Cute dog. Hey, look at me. We're gonna make it out of this. (dramatic music) - That's weird. - What. - I don't remember seeing this back here before. - It's from Sybil High School. It's a reminder to renew your alumina membership. - Great. Hey, remind me to renew my health insurance if I ever get out of here. - You okay? I think you're resetting. - What? It's too soon for that. - No, no it's speeding up. We gotta get the hell out of here. We gotta find Jen. Try to remember the numbers. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - But I feel fine. - SOPs dictate I have to have you medically cleared after an accident. - Okay. And then what? - Well, we go to the station. You give your witness testimony, and then I can drop you off wherever you need. - Okay. Hey Ryan. - Yeah. - I'm kind of hungry. - We can get something on the way to the station. We can eat. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'd like that. You know what? - What? - You're kind of cool for a cop. - Yeah, I've heard that before. - Hey. Hey, you have to leave now. You have to leave, you have to.

(soft music) - [Broadcaster] The strongest storm on record to ever hit U.S. shores. Hurricane Sybil left a trail of destruction in the area. Strangely this storm of the century lost steam as soon as it left the metropolitan area. (soft music) - How's work? - It's fine. Hey mom. - Yeah. - Is it okay if I take the Ray out for a little spin? - Honey, you know your dad got rid of that when he left. Amy, you need to get help.
