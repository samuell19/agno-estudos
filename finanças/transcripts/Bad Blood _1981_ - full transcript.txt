Tiny wrote it seven weeks ago. - [Man] Yeah. - We don't think about what's ahead, but get through one day and wait for the next. I reckon you can put up with anything, if you've got good mates, and I've got the best. It's funny being in one of the oldest countries in the world and coming from one of the youngest. I don't know why but I think about it a lot. Tell Mom not to worry. You taught me how to take care of myself. Your loving son, Tiny. - [Bartender] What do you want? - His mother's taking it really hard.

It's an official call Stan, I want your rifle. Good day Ms. Graham. I have to enforce the law Stan. - [Stan] Yeah I know, but I haven't got it. - What are you telling me? - He hasn't got it. - Where is it? - [Stan] I don't know. - You realise how serious this is. There's a war on. - [Stan] Oh yeah. - Down the right somewhere is it? (Dorothy laughing) - [Stan] Fell back in Mars way Bestie. My fair three doesn't shoot that far. (laughing) - [Teddy] Did you receive the notice. - I can't remember. - I don't know. - [Teddy] It was dated the third of June. - Yeah. - [Teddy] You've got to give up you are rifle Stan. - It's been stolen. - Who would have stolen it? - Teddy, if you don't believe me you can see for yourself. - I will, excuse me. Any idea who stole it Stan? - I think some guy who already turned his in. - You should've reported it to me. - I'd thought I'd give em the chance. - (speaking foreign language) - [Teddy] Stan you've been seen with it. - [Stan] Who seen me? - [Teddy] It doesn't matter. - It matters to me. - Stan, you could be prosecuted. - Then prosecute, you've got your job to do. - It's not fair. - [Teddy] What isn't Mrs. Graham? - The way everyone's hounding us. That .22s mine Ted Best, don't you touch it. It's got nothing to do with Stan. You take that and you take me along with it. - All right Mrs. Graham. - I'm not giving it up for you and any damn law. - Okay, I came for the 303. - It's not here! She told ya. - So you can just barge out the way you barged in. - Next time you see me I'll be serving an authority to prosecute. - Whatever you think, I don't want to get you into trouble.

It's cash on out. Your account is already stands at over 40 pounds. I'm not the only one you owe money too. - And what business is that of yours? Go get your father. - [Boy] Mom wants you. - [Clerk] Look Mrs. Graham, bills have got to be paid. I've got a living to make. - Oh you do all right considering what you charge. Stan he won't give us credit. - I'm sorry Stan. - Sorry, that's a good one. You're trying to ruin us. - Give him the money Dot. - And that's the last we want to see of you. Consider our account closed. (rain pounding) - [Clerk] Hey, you're a schilling short. What do you think of that. 40 pounds and they're still eight broad short.

Some guy just even tried to file the serial number off. But it is mine. - [Ted] I'll see what I can do Stan. - [Stan] Just make sure they get off my back. It's not just the rifle they want, they want the whole farm. - [Ted] Who wants the farm? - [Stan] National Mortgage Care.

You want a beer Stan? - I'd like to have a talk. - Good. - There's a couple of things on my mind. - [Auctioneer] Now on to this lot. (cows mooing) - Bad blood in the valley Stan. - That's none of my doing. - Well no one's blaming you. - When can I get my rifle back Bestie? - You got to join - I need to have my - the Armed Guard Stan. - cows all put down. - It's against the law Stan, I can't be there. - Don't want it. - I can't. - As the law couldn't you turn a blind eye? - Not this one. - The bloody things locked away Major Tom. - Hey Ted. - Can't they look a man straight in the eye? - You're imagining it Stan. - Oh I know what goes on behind my back. - [Ted] Come on Stan I shared you a beer. - I'm going home, the misses is away, anything could happen. - We realised we simply cannot do without a large calibre rifle around the farm. - Now this would do you fine. - Oh yes, how much is it? - Eight pounds 10 shillings. It's a lovely rifle. - I can see that. And ammunition. - I'll order some straight away. - Meanwhile? - Well I think we have enough here for you to be getting on with. Of course you'll need a permit. - Yes, I'll go straight to the arms office. I don't suppose that you could, that shouldn't be any problem, my husband and I are already listed. Patricia, John. - [Clerk] Hm? - Yes. (lawnmower rattling) - [Ted] Just when I thought I had finished. - Notified on the name for Dorothy Graham. It does not appear to be any reason why this should not have been done. - They have plenty of reasons. That house is like an asshole. He should be certified not given another one. - Perhaps that's what you ought to do. - [Pastor] Dear God, throughout the author of peace and lover of convoy, the knowledge of who stand in our eternal life, who's service is perfect freedom. Defend us our humble servants and all of our enemies, that we surely trusting in out defence, may not fear the how of an adversaries, through the life of Jesus Christ our Lord, amen. - [Congregation] Amen. (cow groaning) - [Both] Get up, get up. (Christian music) (cow groaning) - Please don't die. (Dorothy crying) Look at them, tonked up like the dog's dinner. You did it! We know you're poisoning our cattle! Dirty poisoning foreigners! Poison dogs! Poison dogs! Poison dogs! Poison doge! Poison dogs! Yes, you. - We haven't been near your cows! - [Dorothy] If we catch you watch out! (baby crying) (people yelling) We'll get you. Poison Dogs! What are you all gloating at? - [Man] You've got it all wrong Mrs. Graham. - You're trying to get rid of us. Well we'll get rid of you! (dramatic music) You here me!

I would like to stress the fact that the bank has been most tolerant and now it is up to you to respond to their requests. They can not be expected to remain passive any longer. I trust that you will see the reasonableness of our request and give the security asked for. They want the land. (knife thudding) Stan, he's coming down the road! (dramatic music) - Stop! - [Dorothy] Told you to stop! (dramatic music) - You're going to kill me? (dramatic music) - [Man] Cut it out Stan. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - [Man On Phone] Bestie, there's been another incident. Your cover's not too good today. - I'll go straight down. (dramatic music) - [Stan] Get your hand out of your pocket. - Money for that Stan. - [Stan] Get your hand outta your pocket. - Why you pointing that at me? - I'll point it at anyone that comes here to poison my stock. - [Ted] And that's what I came to clear up. What do you reckon they're poisoned with? - [Dorothy] Check the foreigner's place. - [Ted] I'll do that Mrs. Graham. Put that rifle down Stan. (gun cocking) - [Dorothy] You're in it with them. - [Ted] Come down make a statement, we'll get to the bottom of it. - [Stan] It's a trick, to get me away. - [Dorothy] Yeah right Stan. - [Ted] Why would I do that? - [Stan] You're working for them. - [Ted] Who's them? - [Dorothy] The bank, the mortgage crowd. - [Ted] You're wrong. For your own sakes Stan, hand it over. - [Stan] You got my 303, you're not getting this. - Think about coming down and making a statement. - [Dorothy] There's nothing to think about. - [Stan] So just get off! Go! (dramatic music) - [Officer] How many rifles you say he had? - [Ted] Three, at least three. - Well he can only use one at a time. You better come with us. - [Officer] Yeah, sure thing. - You want me to make up the numbers? - [Ted] It's your day off isn't it? - [Officer] The more the merrier. Good on you, show us strength, you and Jack, he'll know we mean business. (phone ringing) On the short wall. - Sarge. (phone ringing) Something like this happened to me once before. There was this German in Greymouth pointing a gun at me. Walked up to him, took it out of his hand. (laughs) What gun have you got? - [Ted] A .32 Webley. - [Officer] On you? - [Ted] No, in the glove box. (dramatic music) - [Officer] Oh here's the bit. Police officers may cease fire arms if it's the opinion of these officers, the owners are of unsound mind. Well that's not in dispute. (man laughing) Hey this things not even loaded Ted. (dramatic music) - [Ted] I hope this won't take too long, it's my wife's birthday. (dramatic music) (teacher talking faintly) - After the name was clear and it had to be drained, because it rains all the time. Why? Any one know? (men arguing) - [Student] Because of the manhunt? (men arguing) - Right, there's something else. - [Stan] They're poisoning the bloody cattle. As far as I'm concerned, the bastards can look after themselves. (men speaking faintly) - Now Mr. Wrigley is going to talk to us about the cow pie competition. He's come all the way from Christchurch to organise it. - Thank you Ms. Gibson. Sit up straight boys and girls. Now I remember the last time I spoke to you about cow pies. (ominous music) - [Officer] Be careful Ted. - [Ted] Yeah. - You don't reckon he's bluffing aye? - [Ted] Yeah. - [Child] Hey dad, come on give me a ride. (ominous music) ((ominous music) (children playing) (metal clinking) - [Child] Randy Bond say I don't smell good. - [Dorothy] I told you to stay away from that one. - [Child] He's stupid. - Stan, they're coming back. (dogs barking) You stay where you are. - And be quiet. (loud knocking) (ominous music) - I'd like to see your husband once more Ms. Graham. - Go get your father. (ominous music) - [Child] Dad, Dad! Dad, Dad! (dramatic music) - What is it this time? - You need proof before you go around accusing people. This sort of thing has got to stop. - Our debt, we're just going to leave. We're waiting to sell off. And you just make sure they look after their business and we'll look after ours. - True right. - [Officer] Good, meantime I want your firearms. - When we leave. - I want them now. - [Stan] I need 'em. - [Dorothy] They're ours. - [Officer] Hand them over Mr. Graham. - [Ted] Keep him calm. - [Dorothy] Don't, come back another day. - [Officer] Come on. - [Dorothy] Please. - [Officer] I want the firearms now. - [Stan] You're not getting them. - Now don't take that attitude with me, hand it over. - Get out of my house. - Come on boys! (gun firing) (Dorothy screaming) (gun firing) (people screaming) - [Officer] Stan, drop it! (gun firing) (body thudding) - [Dorothy] Stan. Stan! (man wheezing) - Help me. - [Dorothy] Stan! (gun firing) - [Woman] No! (dogs barking) (dramatic music) - You, you've done it now. (dramatic music) Stan! (dramatic music) - Help. (glass shattering) Where is your gun? - Out there somewhere. - Get my county. The bed's fine. Come on, you got this. (heavy wheezing) I'm gonna try and make a run for it. - [Dorothy] What out Stan! (gun firing) (dogs barking) (gun firing) (dogs barking) (dramatic music) What are you gonna do Stan? Get in the kitchen. He tried to kill you. Go on. - [Ted] Get a doctor Stan. - You'll be all right. - [Ted] You've got to, or I'll die. - Sign a statement first. - What? - He tried to kill you. - [Stan] That you come to get me. - I think I can. - Use your other one. What do you want to say? - [Ted] Anything you'd like. - I, E. Best, what's your middle initial? - [Ted] M, Mark. - I, EM Best intended to murder Stan Graham. Go outside. - [Boy] Are they dead? - [Dorothy] No, go with your sister. - Give yourself up Stan. You'll only make it worse. - Oh yeah, what about this? (Ted groaning) - I think I got it right. So could. - You'll be all right. - Get the doctor. (dramatic music) - Get the doctor. Right away! - I'll go. - [Lady] What's happened? - Wait for me at the Post Office. (people talking) - [Man] Someone ring for a doctor! (dramatic music) - [Lady] Get a doctor! - Someone is! - Stan, Stan! - [Man] What happened? - What of it? - He gone for a cold through to the place. - They'll get you for this Stan. Are you listening, you've done it now. - We had to. - It was their fault. - Go on. - We're gonna see what could be done. You come? - Okay. - You'll need this. A shotgun there, no point leaving in it. - Cover me. - [Dorothy] Put it down! Put it down! - [Stan] You heard what she said! - [Man] I've just come to help. - Don't worry about them, it was nothing to do with Stan. They tried to kill him. He signed a confession, didn't you. He signed a confession. (Stan breathing heavy) - What's the matter Stan? You know me. - Yeah, but just don't touch the gun. Everything will be all right. I'll keep the bulk of it. And you make sure they clear away. - [Man] Yeah, yeah. - [Man] Give me that. - Give it to me. - [Man] No! - Give it to me! - No! - You want it? - [Man] Yeah. (gun firing) (Dorothy screaming) Stan! - He should never have touched the rifle. - I know. Stan. - Keep hold of the confession. - What am I gonna do Stan? - Find a new father. (dramatic music) Look after the kids, it's nothing forward. - [Dorothy] What about me? (dramatic music) You can't! (dramatic music) Stan, don't leave me! (dramatic music) No Stan! - [Stan] I'll be back. (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) - I begged the police not to fire sergeant, I begged them. I wouldn't shoot anyone. You know that Mr. Copper don't you? The police started it. I want my father. (sobbing) Where's my father. - [Lady] What's the number? - Ricot 377. - My dad shot all the cops. (woman sobbing) (dramatic music) (hammering lightly) (dramatic music) - Two ranks! (men talking) Come on two ranks! - [Reporter] Many expressions of sympathy continue to be received by the police of the man who died yesterday. The condition of the surviving officer is still red. The search for Stanley Graham, last seen yesterday afternoon continues. The great Mountain West Coach and Calvary, has asked for volunteers to report first to their local police station or Armed Guard and not directly to the site of the tragedy as confusion can occur if numbers are too great. (men talking) - Where's Stan Mrs. Graham? - Hey you're not coming in, I can't let you. - [Dorothy] You can't stop me, it's my house. - Yeah, well I'm going to. - I want my washing. - I need things for my kids. - Okay. You bloody will stay out there while I- - You have no right to kick me out of my own house! Get the back. (rooster crowing) (brush scraping) (dramatic music) (men talking) (dramatic music) (men talking) - [Lady] Has anyone seen Sergeant Davis? - [Man] What's he look like? (men laughing and talking) - [Calwell] Quiet! - [Man] Shut up! For those of you armed guards that don't know me, I'm Inspector Calwell from Greymouth. These are sergeants Knight and McRobbie here. We only need eight of you tonight. (group talking at once) - Hold, men hold. - [Calwell] Four in the house. Those of you who can't get home, can bed down here. I'll be up at the Post Office and the password is hogerty. (men talking) The sooner you stop treating this as a night out with the boys the better. You forget that you're dealing with a murderer. And you're here to assist the police. Now, just because we didn't find any trace of him today, doesn't mean that he's not still in the area. Graham's still dangerous. So if you see him, and you certain that's him, and he refuses to surrender, then you're authorised to shoot him. (men talking) What do I think this is, a bloody Boy Scout Jamboree? - [Sergeant] They're only farmers. - [Calwell] Yeah. (dramatic music) (men laughing and talking) (dramatic music) - What you do old Stan just run in here? - [Man In Tan] I don't know. - You want to give him the same chance he gave Bestie, none. So I don't mind watching the door. - [Man In Tan] Nothing's gonna happen. Why would he want to come back. - [Man] No one cares or read the warrant. (men laughing) (frogs chirping) - Geez, just listen to those bloody frogs. - [Man] The story goes they came from Ozzie. - Yeah, even after winning they did. (dogs whining) - [Man At Window] It's something out there. - [Man Standing] Can you make him out? - It's too dark. (frogs chirping) (dogs whining) It's gone. - [Man Standing] Hey, what if it's him? He wouldn't know we're in here. - [Man] What do you reckon we should do? Give us the password. - [Stan] What's your bloody gain, can't a man come into his own house? - [Man] What's the password. - [Stan] Stan Graham. (gun firing) (men yelling) (men talking) (gun firing) (men whimpering) - [Man] You okay Cole? - [Cole] Yeah. (men gurgling) - [Man] He got me in the gut. - [Man] We're sitting bloody ducks. (body dragging) (glass shattering) (gun firing) (men breathing heavy) (glass shattering) (gun firing) - [Man] Cut him off you sill mugger! - That was close. - Don't but money on it. (motor roaring) (water falling) - We gotta do something. - I'll go over, anyone join me? - I would. - All right. Cover us eh? - Right on. - Off we go. Can you hear me? (speaking foreign language) - [Man] We'll give ourselves away. (speaking foreign language) - [Man] There's nothing for it. (speaking foreign language) - Hold your fire, two of us are coming over. - [Man] Watch out he's on the top side of the house. - What? (gun firing) (man groaning) - [Man] That was Maxi. - [Man] Check his back. - He's dead. (gun firing) (glass shattering) - [Stan] Oh! (gun firing) - [Man] We have to evacuate that house. - [Man] About bloody time. (man whimpering) - [Man] You've got to get me out of here. - [Man] Hold on. Let me know, we're trying to leave now. (man talking distorted) - [Man] We've got to risk it. (engine purring) - [Man] Wait, what's the password? - [Men] Get out the bloody way. - Who are you to judge? - What are you trying to do frighten the women? (men arguing) What the matter with you all? - [Man] I see windy rubbish. - What about that guy over there getting the men out? - [Man] It's suicide. - You're a doctor. - [Man] We'll cover you. - [Man] Yeah, you do it, go. - I'm a take 10 on that. (men arguing) - [Man] Tell him to come out. - [Man] Nobody is to fire under any circumstance. - [Man] Stan come on, I've got you covered! - [Man] Turn the lights off. (men breathing heavy) - [Man] Come on we're nearly out of it. Steady. (man breathing heavy) (gun firing) - [Man] All right, I dropped my rifle. (dramatic music) - [Reporter] The Prime Minister today ordered units from the regular armed forces and police reinforcements from all over New Zealand to assist in the search for Stanley Graham, the west coast farmer who three day ago shot and killed several members of the Hokitika Police Force and Armed Guard. Those directing research for the fugitive in the mountainous and densely forested country, believe that larger and more sophisticated forces are required than those locally available. (aeroplane motor roaring) (motor running) - [Man] Goddammit! (cows mooing) Get out, go! (cows mooing) - [Man On Porch] Get yourself thrown out. (motors running) - [Woman] That's ours! Oh locking windows is not gonna keep Stan Graham. - [Man] We've had enough of the bastard already. - If he wanted to single our school, he'll do it in the daytime when you're around. - [Man] You know the score. - You done went out of your way for him. - No good coming from you, isn't it? (plane motor sputtering) (ominous music) - [Man] Who goes there? (gun firing) - Oh. (gun firing) - Everybody out! Go back! You all saw him and 93 of you fired and he bloody got away again. Who's side are you on? Who are you bloody hitting? (dogs barking) What's this? - Oh I suppose we've go the best tracker on the case. - [Calwell] So? - I'll give him a whiff of their blood and let him go. - [Calwell] And then what happens? - My dog will find him. Nothing less-- - [Calwell] Off you go. (men yelling) - [Man] Over! - [Man] To the left? - [Man] That's right. (men yelling) - [Officer] Bar. - [Soldiers] Har! (soldiers yelling) Hut, hut, hut! - [Soldier] Right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. (dog barking) - Cracker Jack. Bloody Cracker Jack. - Women and children are being evacuated, is that right sergeant? - I sure hope so? - There's tripwire bedding and there's lights, he won't get away again. - I hear he built it himself. Pretty resourceful bugger one way or another. (metal clanking) - [Man] They'll be on soon. - You'd better. In some quarters there's a sneaking admiration for him, can't have the police making fools of themselves. Tracking dogs. - [Man] Well sir we're doing the best we can. - [Man] The Prime Minister wants action. Stop playing silly about this, catch him. - [Master] Will you join me Captain? - [Captain] Certainly Master. - You can take your self so. - [Soldiers] Forward march! Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. Right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left. - A message from Hokey sir. - The nurse number. - Farmers. - The bloody window. - Mrs. Graham! - [Dorothy] Yes? - I'm sending you back to Hokitika. - But that's 15 miles away. - [Man] In an hour. - I won't be ready. I've got to go back to the house. - [Man] Ted Best just died. I don't think you're safe here. (soldiers chanting) - Eat up. - If he'd done what I suggested we wouldn't be in this mess. They got what was coming to them. I told your father, I don't know how many times. He doesn't listen. Nobody listens. - I'm listening mom. (birds cawing) (dramatic music) - Stan. (dramatic music) - Steady. Steady. (shells cracking) Steady girl. (milk squirting) Come on now. That's it. That's it girl. (breathing heavy) - [Soldier] Present, fire! (gun firing) Reload, present, fire! (gun firing) Reload, present, fire! Stop, order halt! Present, halt! (bugle music) (people laughing and talking) - [Man] {laughing} you'll get nothing out of the bloody loaf. Major came and they shut up about as tight as a fishes' asshole. (laughs) And that's pretty tight. - They think it's there but it's no sir, nobody else's. - He's dead, I mean it's been about a week now. What about the dog, he ain't around the house all the time. - [Man] Bloody dog, bloody nose. - [Man] Cummins can't give us any info 'cause he's probably scared he'll read about it. I'll tell you, you want to get a story out of this one. (people talking) - You want a story, I'll give you a story. On the nightstand with Emily's knife, if he turned up looking for a feed, I'll give it to him. Meet me in my place with a belly full of warm tucker. (people talking) You've all heard of Lord Hull, we had a telegram for Gables with a message. It said, tell Stan he can call the South Island, I'll send one more jugger to take the North. Any travellers, I can't find that single bugger with the guts to deliver it. (Stan yelling) (dramatic music) (birds singing) - I always hoped this was a friendly place to be. - You don't anymore? You saw him now, you take a shot at him? - [Man] I don't know, here's what it do. Let's hope he's coming to give himself up. (birds singing) - If that rain didn't flush old Stan out, nothing will. Cuts him off as well. He hasn't a hope in hell of crossing the river. - Why would he want to? - His only way out. He's boxed in up here now. You know I spent half the night thinking if I open the window and shout his name, he'd hear me. (metal clanging) (motor approaching) - If the truck's in here and we can head back. Shit. You reckon he still inside? - Could be. - I'll stay here, you get back and find Trev. Get out, gone. Stan! It's Henry Growcott Stan. I'm not armed or nothing. If you want to make a run for it, you go mate, I'm not gonna try and stop ya. Stan. - We now know that he's confined at the top of the valley. He's too badly wounded to travel far. As long as he stays in the bush, he has the advantage. Sooner or later he's going to make a move. With a bit of luck we may see him before he sees us. No one is to risk their life trying to catch him. You just shouldn't. (dramatic music) - [Stan] Over here you stupid buggers, over here. You stupid buggers I'm over here. Come on, come get me. Finish me off, finish me off! (dramatic music) - [Man] What do you reckon? - Yeah I think so. - Which side you making him go? - How should I know. - We can cover both on the top in, you coming? - Yeah. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (Stan groaning) - Nice, shoot it again? - You can't fetch. - I'm seeing Jacqueline tonight. (Stan groaning) - What was I shot with? - 303. - Oh. (dramatic music) (cows mooing) - [Man] That's him man. (dramatic music) - [Man] Make sure his feet clear of the tailgate. (dramatic music) (Stan coughing) (dramatic music) - [Dorothy] Stan. Stan, can you hear me? It's me Dot. - You better go home. - Is that all you've got to say? Stan. (dramatic music) - I have nothing to tell. It's honest dislikes to a question. Just made my life a hell. - [Man] How are you feeling now? - How would you feel, if you got blocked? - Stan. Stan. (Dot grunting) (upbeat music) (audience clapping) (booming explosion) (people gasping) - Macko's jalopi running true to form. (people talking) (upbeat music) (people talking) (upbeat music) - What do you reckon, pure on skin? - Why worry, the world and his wife are in there. (dramatic music) You can still smell it. Not the bloody repertoire. (liquid sloshing) (dramatic music) - Don't waste too much on him. It'll go up like timber. (dramatic music) (glass shattering) (men laughing) What's so funny? - I'd just like to see the expression on her face. - You'd be the one to giver her the news. - [Woman] Make sure she's not in there. Come out of there Dorothy Graham. It's your last chance (fire roaring) (glass shattering) (fire roaring) Come on, play something appropriate. (fire roaring) (solemn music) (glass shattering) (solemn music) (fire roaring) (embers crackling) (dramatic music) (roosters crowing) (dramatic music)
