(dramatic music) (sirens wailing) (mysterious music) (exciting music) (shouting) (flames crackling) (beeping) - Yes? - Jason, I need your help. - I'm listening. - [Man] This morning a courier was attacked and killed and a very valuable art object was stolen. Now we want that object back. - Valuable enough to warrant our fee? - [Man] I'm no sentimentalist. Hey, it's worth a lot of bread. - What do we have to go on? - [Man] Then you accept the offer? - Hey baby, we're on the job right now. I need all the information I can get. - [Man] I'm afraid we don't have much information as to who stole it. What little information we do have will be in your possession directly. - And payment? - [Man] Partial payment is enclosed. - And the rest? - [Man] You'll also find a key. After you deliver you'll receive instructions as to what to do with it. - You're holding me up, I got work to do.

Billy, do a form for me. Hey bro, let me see you work those scythes. (exciting music) (grunting) (shouts) (shouting) (mellow music) That was bad, man. I didn't know you were so shhh. - Oh, think you're slick huh? - Where you been practicing that one? (laughing) - Wow. - Big bad man. - You really caught me sleeping. Where'd that long leg come from? Alright. Got us a new job. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Oh wow. - Witch doctor's fetish, very old. - Oh right. - Already looks interesting. - To me it looking a little devil. - This was used by some village witch doctors for some pretty heavy curses. - I'm sure we haven't been hired to discuss black art. - Very simply an object was stolen and we've been hired to get it back. - Stolen from a museum? - No, from the streets. And a courier was killed in the process. - Do we have any information to work on? - You're looking at it. - There's got to be more than this. - That's it. We got one big puzzle, and the one positive thing we know for sure is that somebody is willing to kill for that little piece of art. - Alright, what's the first step? - To the streets, find out everything we can. - The streets should be jumping by now. - I got some sources I'd just love to tap. - I bet you do. - It's not gonna be easy. - If it was easy they wouldn't need us for the job. Right? - Right. - Alright, let's go. (upbeat music) What do you mean you don't know nothing? - [Man] Listen, can you help me out? - [Billy] I wanna know about the art object. - [Man] I know you know something. - [Man] Hey man, I just handed you another $20 last week for some groceries and you're gonna talk some garbage? - [Billy] What's happening? - [Man] Need some information. - [Man] I know you heard something man. Look you out here every day doing your thing. - [Billy] Hey listen, I know you know something. I wanna know, I don't wanna hurt you. - [Man] Hey mami come here, you're looking good. Come here. No, I don't want no piece, I want some information. (laughing) - There it is! - Up top. (clamoring) - Hey, Adam. - Ain't seen you in the schoolyard for a long time. - Hey man you owe me one. - That's right. - Look I wouldn't come for help man if I didn't think you would help me. - Good shot, good shot. - Hey you can't hold. Yeah, that's nice, nice. You know what I'm here for. I mean the word is out, I need some information. - Lay up, get that man over there! - Right, yeah, you know something don't you? I'll take care of you later. - There it is! Come on, come on, run it in, run it in. - [Adam] Swish. Listen, remember that day we got nice? Yeah, that's the one was said some art stuff was stolen. (speaking foreign language) - Hey, what's happening? - What's going on man? - Oh hanging out, trying to keep cool. (overlapping voices) - [Man] Did you hear about that rip off? - [Eric] You don't understand. - [Man] We don't know what's going on! It's all around town! - You gonna have to pay, listen man. Yo I want some information. Do you know what's happening in the streets? - No I don't know what's-- - Just slow down and give me some information. Do you understand now? You gonna wind up like that watch, man. - Hey what's wrong with you? - I want some information from you. - Information about what? I can't give you no information. - About the artifact. - I tell you I don't know nothing! - I want to hear it, the truth! (shouting) - [Billy] Couple of answers, that's all. - [Man] Sweetheart I'm very happy to answer anything I can answer for you but I just don't know, I don't know a thing about that artifact. - [Man] Hey Jason, what's happening baby? Hey hey, what do you say man? Haven't seen you in quite a while. - [Billy] Need some info. Where did your information come from? I'd like to know where did you hear it? - [Man] Oh it's just around the street. - [Billy] Just around the street? What else is around the street? - [Man] Nothing sweetheart, promise. - [Billy] Come on, shed a little bit more light on it. What exactly did you hear? - [Man] Well I just heard that this courier fellow was killed and some case or something was taken. - Where did you hear it? - You're moving-- - Where were you when you heard it? I've never lost my cool around you Bruce but I'm losing it now. I just wanna know what's going on. - [Man] If I knew-- (funky music) (shouting and clamoring) - Hey, haven't seen you guys in a while. What's going on? Sidney, you know there's dice. - You mean yesterday? - [Woman] Oh, you owe me one baby and I'm here to collect. Okay fella what do you know about the African art object. - Okay, that's cool. - The ripoff. You know something about it, come on man. I think you know something. Know anything about the rip off? - [Billy] It's yesterday's happening. You owe me one, baby. I'm here to collect. - Okay. - Okay fella, what do you know about the African art object? - [Adam] The rip off, you know something about it, come on man, I think you know something. Know anything about the rip off? - You mean yesterday? - You owe me one baby. Not me baby, what's happening? - [Jason] It was a little statue, it had four arms, two arms are facing up, two arms are facing out and front. - [Adam] The rip off, you know something. - [Billy] You hear about that rip off? - [Eric] You don't understand. You gonna have poop and piss all over your body. - [Jason] Alright seven, look at that, smokin'. Later bro. (speaking foreign language) - [Man] You know I really don't know. - Hey lady, que pasa? - Need some help? Stolen artifact. - I don't know. - [Man] Hey man you owe me one. - [Jason] I wouldn't come to you for help man if I didn't think you could help me. I know you can help me. - [Man] No way. Talk to somebody else. - [Billy] Hear anything about that dude got iced? - [Man] You know just what's happening out in the streets, you spend night and day out here. - [Man] Lay off me man! - [Man] A courier was killed. Yeah around the corner, right. - I just remembered, I got an appointment, gotta split. Bye bye, later. (murmuring) - Hey mami, look here. What's going on? Yeah. Yeah. Your information is very important. We looking for this stolen art, you know. Yeah I can slide you $5 if you talk about it. Hey my man. I need some information. This art, it was stolen. - I'm gonna check this out. - No way. - You telling me what to do? - You know it. (shouting) (snaps) Here it is, Z. It was easy. - Piece of cake, just the way you laid it out. - Man he really went down fast. - I don't wanna hear about it. I just wanna see what's inside this case. - We didn't open it just like you said. - Get me a tool to work with. - Let me do it Z. - No I'll handle this myself. - Oh. - Oh wow. - Hey. - Oh man look at that. - That's what we wasted a guy for? - Z knows what he's doing. - Man, that's a spooky looking thing. - This spooky looking piece of wood is worth a lot of bread to all of us. Let's call it our good luck charm. - Bad news baby. - I've got the good news right here. - You better hold tight baby, you've got some tough competition. - Meaning? - Meaning Adam was on my corner asking pretty heavy questions. - He the only one? - Nah, the street was crawling with them. Some people got leaned on. - Are they asking or are they working? - Baby they are working. Nobody looks that hard unless there's something in it. - There goes your piece of cake. - They're after your good news. - Z, how about we split til things cool down? - Way I see it things don't get cool when that outfit goes to work. And you can't spend this. I need a little time to convert this to some real bread. - You can't buy time with those guys. - They can be real sweet and real mean. - Nobody splits. I want them out of my way. - But Z-- - Were you listening, man? - Waste them all and waste them fast. If they're roaming the streets you can get them one at a time. And I call that pretty good odds. (shouting) (upbeat funky music) - What are you doing down here? I wanna rap to you about something. - What's up? - Yesterday there was a rip off, it's a simple thing but I need a little information, something to go on. Maybe you saw something. Or heard something in the neighborhood. - [Man] Oh yeah it's all over the street man. - [Jason] Did anybody see who did it? - He just disappeared. - Yeah? Nobody scoped nobody? - Nobody. - Okay man, thanks anyway. - [Man] Enjoy the apple. (shouting) (funky music) - Hello. - How are you? - [Billy] Did you hear about this rip off? - [Man] You don't understand. You gonna have poop and piss all over your body if you don't give me some information. - [Man] You know I really don't know. - [Man] Hey baby que pasa? - [Man] I'll be glad to do anything in my power to help you out. - [Eric] By the way, here's a donation. (bells tolling) (hitting and kicking) (grunting and shouting) (upbeat music) - What is this, Jim? I wanna know. I'll beat the hell out of you and baby I'm the one to do it so you better speak up now. The rip off, the rip off man! I wanna know about the rip off. Or I'll slap your head into this car. I wanna know about it man. - You working that kick I showed you? Yeah you always tell me you work. I'm gonna see, look, come over here. Come on, set up. Alright let me see that kick. Come on, throw the kick. Alright, come on, throw it again. Alright this time dig it right here. Come on, put it in there. Everything's cool man. Here's a quarter, go down the block, get yourself a soda. I see you around. (shouting) Where's the merchandise? Who copped that merchandise? - I don't know! - Who killed that courier and took the package? - I don't know! - Tell me. Who did it? Who's in charge of this whole set up, who's in charge? Come on punk, give it up. Give it up. - I don't know, I don't know! - Else you'll be like the rest of those eight dudes out there just laying with your face in the gutter. - I don't know! - Ho. - Take it easy. - How'd you make out? - Oh nothing happening. People know something's up though. - Got the same feeling. Got an unusual amount of hassle. The streets are holding back. - Sounds like some mean dudes involved 'cause everybody's uptight. - It's a strange rip off. Not the typical street action. Had some trouble baby? - Oh not much. I'm not even an even match. There were only five of them. - Oh, listen to the sister. - They were so easy even you coulda handled them. - Tough mama. - They came outta nowhere like it was a set up. - Sounds like the hounds are after the fox. - Yeah those dudes were primed and ready, it was no chance beating 'em. - We got a lot of hassle on the streets, how'd you make out? - Nobody said so, but it sounds like the mob and mob with a capital Z. - You said it baby. That's the man. - Where you been, brother? We been searching all over for you. - Oh I just hooked up with some real rough dudes man. - Billy just played the same scene. - Yeah I know. - You know? - One of those gentlemen, he was unfortunate to stay behind for a little hand to hand. With none other than yours truly. - What did you find out? - Some very interesting items. One, Z is the man. Two, Z's got squads of muscle looking for each one of us. Three, the merchandise is in his possession. And it is presently located at this address. - I have the distinct feeling that four very fine cats are about to pay a visit to 427 Verity Street. - Whoa, slow down. You just don't fly in the spider's web without knowing where you're heading. - What did the dude do, draw you a map? - Yeah. - I cased the joint. - Man, I never wanna mess with a broad like that again. - You mean she really put you out of commission? - Where's Skinny? - Last I saw Jason had him against the wall. - What do you mean, last you saw? - We split. That's called survival. (shouting) (hitting and kicking) - [Billy] Come on we gotta find it. - It's gotta be here somewhere. - [Billy] Not over here. - Obviously it's not here. It must be at Z's. - Well, then to Z's we go. - [Billy] Come on, let's go. - [Jason] Alright she's always ready, she's always ready. - [Billy] You said it brother. (groaning) (exciting music) - [Jason] Man we really wrecked the joint. - [Billy] Yeah. - [Jason] Too bad we couldn't have wrapped it up right there. - [Billy] I'll bet Z has a lot of muscle as his place. - [Eric] They better be more together than those guys were. - [Billy] It was like picking off flies. - [Adam] Come on Jason. Can't you push it a little faster? I've got a heavy date. - [Jason] I hope you're willing to practice a whole lot of patience, bro. - [Adam] I'm not worried, she'll wait. - [Jason] Enough. Let's cut through the woods and give Z a little surprise party. - [Billy] That sounds like fun.

Would you accompany me to the pool house please? - Delighted. (light funky music) - Can I get you anything? - Cut the crap, Z. - Felecia you offend me. Can't afford to be too impatient, can we? - Where's the merchandise? - The merchandise is here. Isn't it fascinating that a witch doctor's fetish can hold such a strong resemblance to its buyer. - Only in its power. Well done. - It's a little early to be possessive, isn't it? - The money's ready and waiting. - I'm afraid it's not going to be that simple. - Hey we agreed on a firm price. I'm not here to negotiate. - In plain English, it's getting pretty hot out there. There are other people interested in this little antique. - That doesn't concern me! I paid you to take care of something and I expect you to keep your end of the bargain. - I intend to keep every part of my bargain! The price has gone up. Inflation. You understand. - Bastard. So what's the price now? - A mere 100,000 more. - I'll need til tonight to get the rest of the money together. (laughs) - Not even a hesitation. Alright, delivery tomorrow morning. I've got no more time for games. - Nor do I. 10 o'clock, my place. - Excuse me. - I think you better leave now, there may be some trouble ahead. - 10 o'clock sharp. - Use the back door. Get them before they get here. - They've come in the back way. I think we can trap 'em in the woods. - No guns man. I've got a lot of very respectable people out there. Send as many men as you need. (murmuring) - You hear that music? They must be really partying over there at Z's. Fine scenery. Z's gonna really be surprised. You see what I see? Let's just keep on truckin' like we don't see 'em. - Combat situation. - You got it. (shouting) (hitting and kicking) Alright. (funky music) - You're out of your minds, you'll never get away with this. - We're out of our minds? We left your muscle lying in the woods. - Stop jiving man, where's that artifact? - Jason, do you mind if I use a little bit of feminine persuasion? - [Jason] Oh by all means, baby. (shouting) - Alright, alright. (coughing) - Okay Billy. - Alright, let me up. - Okay Billy. (coughing) Move dude or I'll rip you and your face apart. - Let's be reasonable, will you? This old witch doctor's toy means an awful lot to me. I have a buyer right now who's getting the cash, I can have delivery tomorrow morning. What do you say we split it, 50/50? - Big payoff! Such a generous dude! - Yeah Billy, that's right. He's more than generous. Now let me see. He gets 50% and we get 50%. Now there's one of him and four of us. Which means that I get 25% of 50%. With a total of 12.5%? - Your math is faulty. The way I see it, we now possess this lovely piece of art. That means we've got 100% and Z's got nothing. Baby, my money just doubled and you didn't even know it. - No deals man, let's get outta here. Get Z! (screaming) (exciting music) (shouting) (hitting and kicking) (funky music) - Quite a day's work, wouldn't you say? - We got quite a day's work in front of us man. - You never stop, do you Jason? - Hey man, I have too much bread involved. And what are you complaining about? Didn't we go to a real swinging party? - Really moving. - I don't think we'll ever be invited again. - The way I figure it Z's got three choices. He can either go to that crum pad on Verity Street or double back to his joint or go directly to his buyer. - The buyer doesn't figure. - Why not? - Z said the buyer was in the process of putting the money together for a morning pickup. (snaps) - Right. That's leaves the other alternatives. - Let's bust up both places. - I thought you weren't feeling like Wonder Woman. - Very funny. - Let's not jump so fast. If we play our cards right we could hit the jackpot. Eric, you and Adam go on over to Verity Street and Billy and I will double back to Z's pad. If he shows his face, we'll nail him. - Let's go. - Okay. No question, he's in there. - You signal Adam and Eric. I'm going to sneak up to Z's car and plant this handy little beeper. - We don't want him to see us. - Don't worry about that. We're cool man. Chillin'. (suspenseful music) (dog barking and growling) (clatters) Invisible assassin. Freakin' out. - Adam and Eric are on their way Jason so Z's going to pull the handle and we'll come up with the payoff. (light music) - Listen let's get out and wait for Adam and Eric. This way I can stretch my legs. - Yeah I'd like to move around a little bit myself. - That little dog. (mumbles) You dig my ninja routine? - [Billy] I saw you flying brother. - [Jason] Oh, our two brothers. - [Billy] Yeah, that's Eric's wheels. - Hey brother what's happening? - Oh nothing much, what's going on? Taking care of business? - You take of business, you know I take care of my business. (mumbling) - Nice, beautiful. What's happening in the house? Not too much, waiting for that thing. (birds chirping) - Everything all set? - [Felecia] Just as I said, 10 A.M. - No games, my dear. Things got very rough after you left last night. I've gotta move and move fast. - [Felecia] Everything is set. Just bring the merchandise. - I'm on my way. After you drop me off at Felecia's round up the boys and meet me there. - Good idea. - Let's get going. (upbeat music) - [Billy] Wish we had time for a cup of coffee. - [Adam] Yeah, that's not all I wish I had time for. My woman's been waiting and I spent the night in the car. (beeping) - [Eric] From the sound of it we're getting a little close. - [Billy] Yeah, pull back Jason. We don't want him to see us. - [Jason] Hey we're cool man. Our tracker's doing its job.

Where's your subtlety, your finesse? - I've got no time for that. My uninvited guest took care of that yesterday. - [Man] Hey, look out, here they come! - Stop, stop! - You. - We meet again. - Allow me to make introductions. We are the picker-uppers. Z delivers, you deliver, and we take them all. (laughing) - Jackpot! (kisses and blows) (funky music) (shouting) (hitting and kicking) - The car. - It's time to call our man. - Right. - You know, I've seen a lot of African art and the more I see this fetish the less I understand this whole setup. - What do you mean? - The streets were jumping, right? - [Jason] Right. - Everybody put up a lot of bread and a lot of muscle. And this just isn't worth it. - Hey I'm no art critic but the same thing crossed my mind. - Well if I read you right there must be more to this whole situation. - This jackpot is growing bigger and bigger. - The book says a witch doctor's fetish is supposed to be hollow. (taps) So that they can fill it with mean evil things, right? - Come on man, where is that hollow spot? - Let me see inside. - You really had us going. No evil stuff, no buried treasure. Too bad. - Guess we struck out. - Yeah. - Trust my vibes, something's just not right here. - Alright everybody, slow down a minute. Let's put the pieces together logically. We feel that this artifact is not worth all the effort we put into recovering it. But then there's a lot of heavy people who think it is. (snaps) Wait a minute. - Maybe we've been looking at the wrong thing? - [Jason] Eric I know just what's in your mind. - Can I make this a threesome? - Hey! - That's it alright. - Jackpot! (whistles) Alright. - Pure heroin. (laughs) - Hey, this ain't no small time haul, is it? - No. - You know something? Now the pieces fit together. - I'll dump this junk and see that it never reaches the streets. - That's cool man. We dump the stuff and deliver the fetish. - And that leaves Z holding the bag. - Hey man, a triple ripoff! Let's split. - Alright, okay.
