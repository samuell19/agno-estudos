Why Pollack? Take the bag. If Odessa is the mother, New York is the father. Vladimir keeps on joking all the time. - Move aside, move aside! - Excuse me! Excuse me! - Wolfgang, faster! - Yes, yes. - Look out! - Come, come, come! I was the first, I reserved this place back in Constantinople. - Come, Wolfgang! - No, no, it's a tandem. Excuse me! - It was supposed to be a tandem! - I'm the reserve! Communism shall abolish all frontiers Mayakovsky! Mayakovsky! Mayakovsky! Go back to your place, citizen. Yes, you. Back to your place. Take off your hat. Are you an American citizen on the way to Sumatra? Why did you come to Odessa then? My father is buried here. I wanted to visit his grave. Two days will be enough? Are you a fisher? - Who? - Entomologist... Butterflies! Just a moment. Let me see. What an interesting thing. Very convenient. You may go. Well, well! It's not America! - Welcome! Welcome! - It's mistake! I'm not Mayakovsky! There! My name is Aglaya Ivanowna Glushko! I came to welcome you! A few words for the “Seaman”. To all those courageous and young at heart, - we give hammer and sickle. - It's some misunderstanding. It's a gift for you from Russflot. For the first passenger of the connection New York - Constantinople - Odessa! And here are some more gifts. Thank you! - And now to the hotel? - To the hotel, yes, yes. I am taking my passport out of my pocket — a priceless load. Look and envy me! I'm a citizen of the Soviet Union. We've prepared for you many attractions! Oh, you"re a bit dirty! In the hotel? In the hotel you will get an excellent suite! We're driving so slowly on purpose so that you could take a look at the city. It's Feldman boulevard, and this is the building of the former City Council. What are you the most interested in? There is no sex here. No jazz either. But I will try to get you some boxing. How is comrade Chaplin doing? According to recent data he approached American communists. Why are you taking pictures of me? We're making a report about your stay in Odessa! We want to immortalize each of your steps! I protest! I came here privately, to visit my father's grave! Oh, so this is why you speak Russian so well. - Your father was Russian? - No, he was Polish. - From Odessa? - No, an exile to Siberia. His grave is in Odessa, I want to visit it. - We'll organize it as well. - I want to be on my own! No reporters! Well, we'll see. Pass! - We'll go and check in. - No vacancies. Bicycle race: On a tandem towards a bright future. A suite was booked for this citizen. He is an American, guest of the Russflot. Kostia, take comrade American! Guten Morgen, comrade American! Carefully! In America the ideals of the French Revolution are only words, here they were turned into action. You exploit Negroes, we replaced them with machines. Mechanical carrier! It will get your luggage directly to your room! - A foreign import? - Our own work! - Our! - What?! Where is my luggage? On the way to your room. In the transmission pipes. There is no reason to worry! Did you hear that? It got to the second floor. - What is going on? - Your employee offended the American! He reminded him of the ideal of the French Revolution, and the American went mad and broke all the gifts. You see, here is your luggage. Don't get angry, it's the best system in Europe! So what? Everything in order! Well. The regulator went off. I'll fix it right away. It's a scandal! One must be a complete idiot to fix such a fragile handle to such a heavy cart. - Woman... - What is it? John? Are you so mad because of the handle? We'll make you a new one, an iron one! Citizen Pollack, we must go! Our programme is very busy. People are waiting for us! If you don' leave in five minutes, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. You'll miss your meeting with the Potemkin veterans and you'll never see them. What do you want, woman?! Come! This suite belongs to us by law. We are the first passengers! Our bike! - Why? - When I was a boy, I asked God for a bike, and he never gave me one! It means that God doesn't exist! - Who's next? - I'm the reserve! Away! The regulator went off. A spring broke. I'll take the handle to our designers' bureau - Give back the handle. - and we'll fix it. Excuse me, comrades, haven't you seen a man running here? Stop! We're looking for a member of an underground moonshine-brewing syndicate who ran into this hotel and seems to have disappeared. What scandals! And I would like to ask comrade foreigner to keep quiet! This is a hotel, not some Wall Street! If you're a foreigner, better keep away from Feldman boulevard. Aphrodite! Ditta! Catty! Open, it's me, Georges! - I'm awfully sorry! - How did you get in here? I live in the next room, I went onto the balcony and the door locked on me. If you don't mind, I'll go to my room. - Yes, just make it quick. - Thank you. Please, help! What was that? - Just as I thought. - Georges, I'll explain. - There is no need, everything is clear. - Georges, don't be such an Othello, I'm here by accident. On him, in bed?! It's over! Georges! What roses! Georges! There is nobody here! I brought you some tea. - Thank you. - Are you an American? If you can spare me a moment, will you tell me about America? Tomorrow, before my departure. Thank you. Have a nice stay in Odessa. The era of amateur bandits is over in our city. We are on the brink of a new era of moonshine. Thanks to this gold-bearing source we will turn into a powerful, modern empire of mobsters! May the opening of this casino signal the new era of moonshine! As you see, the days of Benio Krzyk are gone never to return. The age of Mikita Nichiporuk has begun! And now let's get to work. Our first transport, 20 thousand litres of moonshine was sent by sleighs on the great moonshine trail via Arkhangelsk and Chukotka to Alaska. And from there to the speakeasy bars of Chicago, New York, Miami! The second transport departs next week, and that means we are to bake 10 thousand loaves more. Happy and fruitful work. Merci for your attention. - Good afternoon, Mikita Mikitich! - You may open. Mick Nitsch. Mikita Nicheporuk. Nicheporuk... Nicheporuk... Calm down, calm down. My name is Piotr Moiseyewich Kriwonoshchenko, - contractor from Kharkiv. - How did you get here? - I live here! - I live here! And I live here! Here is my pass. You infringe on my privacy! I know, I know. I was warned that I was going to live with the first passenger from New York, Johnny Pollack. Horses wear these in our parts! Oh, what a mess! Someone hid it here and forgot, we must take it to the reception desk! You speak so beautifully! We have also started to learn English in our cooperative: capitalism - bad! Worker - good! Why did you check in another person in my room? Just a moment. Because Russflot booked only one place. How could you have let a stranger into my room?! Firstly, it's not your room, and secondly, only one place was booked for you, and there are three places in the suite. Would you like to live alone in a room for three, when thousands of people need a place in the hotel? I will pay for all the three places! Maybe in America you can get everything for money, but here we care for the people! Unfortunately, we don't have any free rooms. And what do you need a separate room for? We have purposefully booked a three-place room to make your stay more jolly. And now change quickly and let's go! I begged the Potemkin veterans to wait for you. What Potemkin? I came here to visit my father's grave! We'll organise that as well when you come back from Leningrad. - Lenin-what? - Haven't they warned you? Tomorrow in the morning you're going to Leningrad for a week. - No, no... - Russflot pays! I'd like to introduce Ostap Mogilny, our master, and this is his masterpiece. A perfect job! With a handle like this you can go - to Leningrad. - The most important thing is inside. Radio receiver. You go with your luggage and listen to the Comintern radio. Where is my handle? Ostap made it into a surprise-souvenir. Citizen American, I think it's yours? - Express or regular? - Express. Tomorrow. It will cost five times more. 5 roubles 85 kopeks. This is not money. Give me roubles. It's not money! Give me roubles, roubles! Where can I exchange dollars? I am not an inquiry desk! And stop messing around! So what? Can we go now? Citizen Pollack, you sabotage our programme of your visit. Leave me alone! - Where can I exchange dollars? - In the bank, but it's better... Nicheporuk's bakery. It's near, 15 Feldman boulevard. Citizen Pollack, you can't behave like this! Our heroes are waiting! Citizen, leave the foreigner alone! I haven't had the time to invite you to our meeting! We'd like to discuss the issue of smuggling comrade Chaplin into the USRR! - Where is he gone? - The American disappeared because of you! - Pass! - But it's Vladimir Mayakovski himself! Even if he's Pushkin I won't let him in without his pass! Sir, spare a penny! What can I do for you? We have freshly baked bread! I was told I could exchange money here. Marks? Francs? Pounds? Dollar is going down. Our exchange rate is 61 kopeks for one dollar. OK, I'll be here for another half an hour. It's for our regulars, made to order. Take it away, you idiot! Stop! Are you out of your mind? - Grandma, come here. - Oh, what a tasty fish! Red gills, fresh fish, delicious. Good fish! A toy, not a fish! What is it, kid? A parcel for citizen Nicheporuk. Give it here. Mikita, a parcel for you. - Who brought it? - Some kid... - No vacancies! - I live here. - Pass! - I live here! - Pass! - What pass? - I'm an American citizen! - You may be French for all I care! I won't let you in without a pass! Welcome to our shack! One can starve here! In the restaurant they cater only to cyclists, and in the buffet to dentists! And this is Ahmed! Our third neighbour. Also a contractor from Tashkent. - Salam aleykum. - Good guy! People here are most hospitable. They knew I was coming from Uzbekistan, and they had a robe ready for me! Let's drink to our acquaintance! No fear, Johnny, it's legal here. I am responsible for him to Russflot. - I don't drink. - So let's eat some watermelon, my friend! I brought it from Uzbekistan. There is no prohibition here! Johnny! To friendship! How can you live in that America? You may congratulate me. We made up with Georges, we're getting married in a week! Georges, I'll explain everything. You won't take me alive! - What kind of sweets was that? - With rum. - Well, they must have gone off... - What?! What is it with you? Why are you jumping like this? - Over! It's over! - He fell on me! - You were caressing his ass! - It was just a massage! - Fortunately, not an internal one! - How dare you... It's him! Jivan? - It's Jivan! - No, no, it's a mistake. I'm John Pollack from America! Jivan Polakian. I'm your uncle, Ashot, - and this is your brother, Aram! - Aram! I heard it on the radio that you came back! Who was shooting here?! Where did the shots come from?! Did anyone see where they were shooting from? They all did not believe. But I knew you'd come. - I prepared a gun for you! - I need a gun! Later! Let's go! - It's them. They found me. - Who? - The mob. - And where from is the mob here? Ever since you came from Chicago, I've heard it all the time: the mob! Kid brought you a fish — the mob. Cops chase pickpockets — it's the mob again! I wish we had the mob here but we need to work some more to get there. A fish means death warrant for the mob from Chicago! There is no one from Chicago here except for you. The first American arrived only today from New York. Some Professor of Columbia University. He came from America, from New York, a professor? What are you more afraid of? The mob or Columbia University? Shut up and take care of the professor. Don't let him out of your sight, OK? - No, I don't drink at work! - Have some, just a drop. What work? They are crazy about their work in America. Work, work! Is there nothing more holy then work in your life? Mommy? So drink to your mother's health! I don't drink! Gun. I don't drink! This is the grave of the man who was the dearest to you. Didn't I say, he shouldn't drink? They have prohibition there. Janik lost the habit and here is the result! - My mom is dead? - She is, she is... And here, in this grave, is your brother! Not anymore! Your mother died of grief when she learned that the bastard had killed him! Killed?! Killed?! Give me a gun! Give me a gun! Didn't I tell you? Even in America he remained a true Armenian! Jivan-John, calm down! We have a gun! Sleep, sleep, my dear. Rest. You have hard work ahead of you. - Where am I? - On the train. - What train? - To Yerevan. What Yerevan? Why Yerevan? The bastard that killed your brother escaped to Yerevan! This fool thought you would not find him there. He went mad... - Where am I? - In the hotel. - And who am I? - You're John Pollack. An American scientist, entomologist. You're going to Sumatra to chase butterflies. I saw him first. You're the first passenger of the Russflot line New York - Constantinople - Odessa! - Does it mean I'm on the ship? - In the hotel, in Odessa. Has he gone mad? These are typical symptoms of retrograde amnesia. A man is perfectly healthy but can't remember anything. I rode first, I saw him first! He pushed us from the boat and we... moment! Only a strong shock can bring back his memory. - Saved! - Friendship above all! - Germany above all! - Yes! - Why in Odessa? - You see! He can't remember anything! - To visit your father's grave. - Comrades! Let's all go to his father's grave! I've been here before. He also suffers from déjà vu! There is no reason to worry, it's not an illness, just a minor mental disorder which makes a man think that what is happening to him now has already happened. I have obviously been here! It's my mother's grave! It's his mother's grave. Why wasn't a Negro our first passenger? This is citizen Polakian's grave, and you're Pollack! Your father was buried in Odessa. - And my brother? - What brother? Where is my brother buried? - Where is his brother buried? - How am I to know? I want to see my brother's grave. Help me find it. Oh, there it is! Here! It's him! - What did they do to him? - Killed him. As a member of the Communist Youth Organisation I don't believe in the afterlife. - He lives in our hearts! - Thank you. Enough! We must take him to the hotel! Otherwise he'll spend the whole day wandering around the cemetery. - You brought him here again? - What do you mean: again? - He was here last night. - He couldn't have been here last night! - I saw him! - You're also suffering from déjà vu! Alcoholic... But what are we to do? Positive emotions are highly indicated. Let's show him the city! Is it Julius Caesar? It's the founder of Odessa, duke de Richelieu, French. I don't like the French. They are not allowed in our hotel. - Do you know what he likes? - Jazz, boxing, and sex. Sex is out of the question in cases of retrograde amnesia! There is no sex here! Boxing is not advisable either. But jazz, why not? Music won't do him any harm. Where will I find jazz for him?! We must take him to the hotel, lock him up and that's all! Excuse me, I am Professor Babochkin, entomologist. From the University of Odessa. I read in the news that a colleague from Chicago visited our city. It's him. - Could you introduce me? - We might. Citizen Pollack! Your colleague, professor, would like to meet you. - If you can spare me a moment, naturally. - Do I have the time? Loads! Your ship to Sumatra departs tomorrow in the morning! I have a lot of time, nice to meet you. Dear sir, quick, here! A rare species — Prinz's Apollo! This is supposed to be the mob! He is a complete idiot! Professor! Professor! Are you mad?! - Why? - You failed your voluntary defence practice tests and because of you the whole institute can't participate in community action. Oh God! Miss! Miss! Miss again. And you, comrade, why are you shooting? - Me? - You, you. - Take the gun! - I can shoot. You professors are trouble. - Name? - Pollack. - What faculty? - Colleague is not from our institute, - he is from America. - Excuse me. Do you see?! Their professors are ready to fight, and our professors? You can only stare in your microscopes and chase after butterflies. He is not a mobster but a total moron! He spent half a day wandering around the cemetery and now he is chasing butterflies. And he suffers from déjà vu! - What is it? - Something messed up with his head. An old trick of the mob. Pretend to be a moron to distract your enemy! - And where is he chasing the butterflies? - In the park at the colonnade. Actually, why should I know how to shoot? Shooting is the business of soldiers, our business is to chase butterflies. - Do you agree? - Basically, yes... - American? - Yes, Chicago Daily Tribune. Hey! You there! Get lost! - May I? - It's for you, a gift. Haven't you heard me?! There is a glen nearby... - Boys, get lost, right now! - Where you can find Scarce Swallowtails. Let's eat something quickly and we'll take a look at them. With pleasure. - What entree would you like to order? - I'd like to start with... He won't order anything! The restaurant is closed, booked up. What a pity! I have just invited my American colleague... - Well, we can feed the American. - And me? Stop! Disperse... for feeding! The main course is either a meatball with rice or steak with potatoes. A meatball with potatoes, please. A meatball with rice! Steak with potatoes! Meatball with rice, steak with potatoes. - We'll change later. - It's forbidden to change! - Is there vodka?! 100 grams! - Georges, there is no need! 200! Oh, it's you, I'm so lucky! I beg of you, tell Georges that there was nothing between us! - Do I know you? - And who was I in bed with? Whom I gave a massage? In this case I am ready to admit that - there might have been something. - No! But I can't remember anything! This is too much! Georges! - What is it going to be? - There are too many people there! All the best. Odessa. Contract - kill Mick Nitsch! - What time is it? - 4 p.m. We have a lot of time. Gun! Give me a gun! - Georges! Georges! I beg of you! - Leave me alone! - OK. - Ditta! Wait! So you liked the shooting after all! And we are in for an endemic species of butterflies! Who is in command here? Waiter? Finish your meal, eat up! Clean up your plates. You over there, eat up! Faster! Just don't leave your weapons behind! Dear Lord, our boys made a landing! - Pass. - Get lost! Moron! Your Excellency, with all due respect, I can't let you in without a pass. Orders of the new authorities: don't let in without passes! Who do you want to see? Look, Ahmed, it's our Johnny! Abram Semyonich said you had gone mad and left for America to seek medication. - Who's there in my bed? - Abram Semyonich. Shalom, I'm Abram Semyonich. I came from Vladivostok. Where is my luggage? - Haven't you taken it? - From Vladivostok. Excuse me, - you come as a guest or an invader? - Invader! I must ask you then - will there be pogroms? There will, there will. - Comrade Kolpakov, the Whites are in the city! - What Whites? A white lieutenant has just entered the hotel! A white lieutenant! Bullshit! They have all been defeated! I mean, not all of them apparently! I mean, there's been an invasion! You should drink less! Understood? Why did you check in another person in my place? Why is there another man sleeping in my bed! Ah, it's you? Because you did not spend the night in the hotel. That's right! He didn't! So according to the instructions you were checked out! - But the room was paid for! - So what? According to the instructions it doesn't change anything. Citizen, don't swear here, please! Your luggage is in the left luggage room. You'll get it in two hours time. Our employees are currently participating in a training in cultural customer service. Your Excellency, you mustn't. Get lost! Excuse me! With all due respect, I must object! Your Excellency, you mustn't! They will sack me! - Your Excellency... - Shut up! Please, your Excellency, at least tie me up so that they could see, that I tried to resist. Your Excellency, don't kill me! Put me through to the Secret Service, right now! Secret Service? The Whites are in town! - I killed him. - Who? The Professor. It's enough to get rid of the intellectuals, - there are not many left anyway. - But he was an American! What is it now? - And if it was a real professor? - So what? I will kill all Americans coming to Odessa. - All of them. - Mikita, this way we'll cause an international scandal. And what do I care?! Cable from America. Customer complaint. What complaint? - Something happened to the shipment? - The shipment was OK. 20 thousand bottles arrived. - So what else do they want? - 500 bottles were empty. - 500? - The boys must have drunk them. The North, Alaska, cold. They wanted to warm up. - 500 bottles? - There were five of them! - Who hired them for the job? - I did. Put all into buckets with concrete and throw them into the seal! Because of the bottles? Listen, this is not America. If for each 50 bottles we will throw people into the sea - - there will be no one left to work with! - To the sea! We're closed! Stocktaking! Stop! Stop! Stop! Assume positions! - Look, the lieutenant is not in the picture! - Assume positions! We begin shooting! - Where have you been?! - He's good! Get him here! Where is your moustache?! Back on the set now! The unit practiced without you! Attention! - The mob! - You may start! Shoot on my order! Attention! Get ready! Camera! Action! Don't smile! This is my part! Pretender! I am the lieutenant! - Perfect! Shoot! - Watch that pram! Where do you take these cakes?! Put them on the counter! - You really are something. - Shut up! Now I remember where I met this guy! He exchanged dollars here yesterday. - Moron! Fool! Idiot! - Why? I offered him our rate! - One to one! - My luggage! You're leaving? - No, I'll wait for him to kill me! - He can't even if he tries! I checked it, he's leaving tomorrow. - His visa is valid for 48 hours. - Idiot! He won't leave until I'm dead! Rule of the mob! - So we have to kill him! - Who will do it? You? There is one specialist — the Bomber! He was Macho's right hand! You go into hiding and he does his job. Where can I hide? You don't know the mob. They will find a man even in the devil's ass. In the ass, maybe, but not in Kuyalnik... Perfect hideaway, and you can cure your nerves as well. Praise the Lord! He woke up, finally! - Where am I? - In the hotel. - And who am I? - Invader! Or maybe a guest? Comrades, he suffers from retrograde amnesia. He can't remember his past. I am going mad with him! As if it wasn't enough that he boycotted the programme, failed the Potemkin veterans, or to go to Leningrad, he has retrograde amnesia on top of all that. That's it. Russflot quits. - Who am I? - You're John Pollack. American scientist, entomologist, on your way to Sumatra to catch butterflies. - Does it mean I am on a ship? - For the moment still in Odessa. - Why in Odessa? - To visit your father's grave. Good morning. My God, he comes here as if to work. - What do you mean? - Both days and nights. - Why do you say so? - It's the third time that I've seen him! You must be suffering from déjà vu, comrade. You should seek help. The worst thing about America is the mob. It's time to put an end to it. - Absolutely. - It's not so simple. As long as an oligarchy is in power, it's difficult to eradicate such social ills. - You think so? - It's a basic truth. The oligarchy doesn't care a straw for mobsters so you, common people, should organize a committee to fight against mobsters. - Naturally! - And the next time you come to Odessa you won't recognize anything. There will be a factory here, and another chemical factory there! We'll make Odessa an industrial giant! Greetings to comrade Chaplin from the Young Pioneers of Odessa. Tomorrow we will see you off with our entire unit. You ordered tea, here you are. Thank you. Just a moment, where is the nice girl who used to bring tea? There never was any nice girl here. Excuse me, I am suffering from déjà vu. One, two, three, faster! One, two, three, One, two, three, one... - What's going on there? - Calm down. Only cats give birth quickly. Comrade American. You mentioned something about sex, boxing and jazz. There is no sex here but as for the rest, here you are. - Are you American? - John Pollack, American scientist, I am on my way to Sumatra to catch butterflies. We've been looking for you all evening! We are quarrelling because of syncopation. Is this syncopation? Rat's ass, not a syncopation! This is syncopation! One, two, three, One, two, three... Silence! We have to get up early tomorrow! - Syncopation? - But I don't know. What is syncopation?? - Kostya, what is it?! - What do you want from me?! You made up that syncopation! Quiet! - Come! - Yes. Quiet! This is syncopation! We're getting up early tomorrow! Did you connect everything the right way? Yes. Calm down, not reason to worry. Well, gentlemen. I'm ready! Let's go! He must only touch the bed. Jazz bands are forbidden here! And I advise you to sleep in your room! Yes, yes! I will! Just don't get him drunk! He doesn't drink at all! Don't slam the doors! Mikita! - The Japanese for you. - Yes. That American killer is no longer dangerous. Odessa is not exactly Chicago but we have our ways as well. To put it in a nutshell, the American professor doesn't exist ant longer. Here you are: here is sex, there are roulette, sandwiches, champagne, and the next number is ours. Soviet jazz! And now, ladies and gentlemen, sensation! For the first time in Soviet Union - striptease! - Who sent you? - I am an American entomologist. I'm going to Sumatra to catch butterflies. I came to Odessa to visit my father's grave. You may tell such bullshit to journalists but not me! You're the hitman sent by the mob, to kill Mikita Nicheporuk. No! I am an American scientist, entomologist. I came to visit my father's grave, he was Polish. It's the Japanese again. - Yes? - Mikita, can you hear it? - What are you doing, kneading dough? - No, it's not dough. We're helping your American regain his memory. American? - But he was blown up! - He came back. But now he's tied up and can't do any harm. - Shoot him and bury the body. - Understood. Hit me again. So? Now you remember, you scoundrel?! I do. Where is Mick Nitsch? Take the boulevard to the bridge, left by the slaughterhouse and down the steps. How did you tie him up, you moron?! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Damn American! Our great Sidor brothers in the lead. Let us welcome them, comrades! These mud baths cured me completely of all stress and disorder. Let's drink to NEM: New Era of Moonshine! Gentlemen, I saw a live American in the hotel today! You were lucky, madame. You won't see him again. Has he left us? Everybody rise! Against the wall! No, Georges is there! Everything is OK! Mikita Nicheporuk, you're under arrest! Thank you. Thank you, citizen Pollack, for your help in arresting a dangerous criminal. Thank you. For a long time we have been chasing the moonshine-brewing sindicate and its boss Nicheporuk but we could not catch him red-handed! We finally succeeded thanks to you, citizen Pollack. Kriwonoshchenko? Head of the Investigation Department. They got it figured out very well! Apart from export of moonshine there is also delivery of "bread" to Kuyalnik. Such a gourmet would sit in a tub and drink moonshine! Just like in Chicago! Excuse me, citizen Pollack, we also suspected you. - Lieutenant Pereplyotchikov! - Sublieutenant Aphrodite Pereplyotchikova! You're married already? Excuse me. We received an anonymous letter that you were an American mobster. Now we know whose job it was but we had to watch you for a while. We really are married. Georges regrets it that he hit you, but he loves me madly and he is really jealous! You knew I was a mobster? After what you did it became clear that you were an honest man. And he loves his father so madly, comrade! He visited his grave three times! - Cemetery number two? - Sergeant Vasin. If there were more people like you, we would have less work! Listen, I kill people! Put me to jail, with Nicheporuk! Please, I will pay you in dollars! One minute late again! Your ship to Sumatra. - To Sumatra? - You don't have to worry. A special boat will deliver you directly on board. I don't want to! I don't want to! - Help me! I must kill him! - No way. No way! Otherwise the mob will kill me! Comrade doesn't want to leave us. It's comprehensible but we all have our duties. We catch criminals and you butterflies. I'm not going! You have to, you have to, my dear! - I'm not going! I want to go to jail! - Your visa is valid only for 48 hours! I want to go to jail in the Soviet Union! I didn't do my job! They'll kill me in America! The most typical mental disorder today is paranoia. In a moment you will see a patient suffering from this illness. Sundukov, please. You see here an American scientist, entomologist, who was going to Sumatra to catch butterflies. He came to Odessa for two days to visit his father's grave, who used to live in Odessa before the revolution. As a result of a minor concussion he suffered from retrograde amnesia, and later on from déjà vu. The patient believes he is an American mobster sent by the mob to kill another mobster who allegedly lives in Odessa. The patient believes that if he fails to fulfil his duty, the mob will kill him! The patient was put on the ship to Sumatra three times, but every time he jumped into the sea and swam back to port, until he ended up here. How is he today, Petrovich? Today he is quiet but yesterday he tried to bite his way through the bars. It was for the best that Sundukov noticed it just in time. Pay attention to him. Why doesn't anyone here believe me? And let's move on to persecution mania. Back to your place! Take your position! Passengers travelling to the USA via Constantinople and Marseille, please move to berth nr. 2. Forgive and farewell, Mother-Odessa, Father-New York waits for me! 999... One thousand! Hey, young master, handsome, free! I will tell you everything about your future! Go away, citizen! Welcome, comrade. A few words for The Seaman. I'm Aglaya Iwanovna Glushko! I would like to welcome you to Odessa! On behalf of Russflot! No! If you think so, you're wrong about Odessa! To all those courageous and young at heart we give hammer and sickle. It's a gift for you from Russflot, as the 1000th passenger on the New York - Constantinople - Odessa line! - And now quickly to the hotel! - Hold him up, comrades! Communism shall abolish all frontiers
