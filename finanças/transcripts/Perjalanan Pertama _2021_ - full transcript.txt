♪Blowing wind is a verse♪ ♪Darkening cloud is a verse♪ ♪This is a journey♪ ♪to search for a name♪ ♪of a grandfather and his grandchild♪ ♪who feel incomplete♪ ♪Here is the journey they took♪ ♪in their the first journey♪ Soon we will hold village head election. That's what I call democracy because we all have the right to vote. Therefore, we must choose a village leader that suits our needs. If a leader is corrupt, - It does not... - Excuse me. Go ahead. As long as he's happy. Keeps getting money. Here. - Thank you, granny Piah. - You're welcome. I hope you'll get good grades in your report card Amen. - You also won the football competition, didn't you? - Yes. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. But if, Mr. Ramli becomes the village head... It'll be a disaster! - I'm leaving, Granny. - Yes. Based on my research, he only wants to travel across the country by attending various seminars. The results? We'll never know. Don't spend too much time in the coffee shop, Uncle Leman. Before you know it, it's almost sundown, and no work has been done. This is probably the 4000th time Yahya mocks me like that. Last week, I turned 70. I hope, I can make you a pair of bracelet. Amen. A pair, Mr. Tan? Can't be three, right? Are you planning on marrying two guys at the same time? Find yourself a husband, Nurma. Women are meant to be found, not to find. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - My name is Muchtar. - Tan. - Muchtar. - Nurma. Please have a seat, Mr. Muchtar. Please call me Muchtar. Please. - So, here's the thing, Mr. Tan. - Yes. I've been seeing the artworks pictures of this workshop on social media And I think, this workshop's artwork is very interesting. Even my colleague recommended me to come here and order. Office souvenirs? A dowry. But, I think it will not be in the form of rings, or bank notes origami. What then? It can be anything. But we work based on the order. It can be anything. I haven't heard that for a long time. It's like a window, widely opens. Bringing life to my nerves. What are the names of the bride and the groom? I don't think that is necessary. I am only looking for something that has deep meaning for a new life. Marriage is a new life, isn't it? Well, it's not completely new. You've known each other for some time, right? Miss. Some people needn't to know each other long but fall in love and get married. Those won't last long. Not all couple who have been dating for a long time would last, and not all who just knew each other would break. It all goes back to the heart and its intention. But, a dowry without the name of the bride is a little unfair for the woman, don't you think? There are other things women would need more than just dowries. It seems to me you're not from Kuraya or Madania. I, I'm from Bukik Gadang. But I've been living in Jakarta for some time. - I came home for for this marriage. - That's so beautiful. Coming home for a marriage, starting with this dowry. Grade six should have been an example. If you did not want to lose, you should have scored some goals. Not brawls. Now what? Another six-grader wants some piece? Relax. - Sit down - What for? Just sit down. This is Pendi's father's head. This is Yahya's father's. Who can kick first, he wins. Okay? Never mind his father's head, even his father's name, no body knows. Mr. Tan, I'm leaving. See you later. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. I'm really happy. The pictures from Warisan Chaniago's social media have brought me to this faraway land. I am truly lucky. Miss Nurma, if I may ask, please send me the pictures of the process. Sure. Obviously, you won't be the only one who will be happy to see the process. Of course. All brides would cherish the days before their marriages. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - Take care. - Will do. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. FATHER'S NAME: - MOTHER'S NAME: - 1ST PLACE: FOOTBALL COMPETITION Congratulations, Yahya. Sir. Congratulations, Yahya. - Congratulation, Mr. Tan - Yes, thank you. Thanks. Thanks. FIGHTING IS A GAME WHERE EVERYBODY LOSES Excellent. Thanks. ENJOY YOUR BREAK LEARN FROM MOTHER NATURE - My colleague said that you're moving away? - Yes. Yahya? Yahya. Let's have dinner with together. I have made Asam Padeh. It's the fish you caught earlier this afternoon. Well, at least we can celebrate the trophy. Don't you have any wish for the triumph? Can I have a request on this winning day? Absolutely. What are the names of my mom and dad? Salma Zulaikha. Irman Abraham Saleh. Grandpa, you are getting older when it comes to making up names. I'm now big enough to realize that every two or three years, my parents' names keep changing. Rizaldi Abraham and Laila Purnama were not listed on the flight manifest of the Hercules C-130 plane in 2009 And what you missed when making up stories back then, that it was an Air Force accident, not a commercial plane. Suddenly you created stories, saying that my father turned into a soldier from a food-technology engineer. I'm heading to the mosque, Grandpa. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. LOOKING FOR MOM AND DAD [FEMALE VOICE] If that is really your intention to leave, we can only give our blessings. In the name of Allah. - Catch it. - Enough. Yahya! Catch it. What's up, Zakia? I made a promise to our friends to paint anything. It starts from grade one. I'm leaving for Malaka with my mother. God has destined her to study there. Please continue my work. Will do. I'll take care of it for the next one year. Oh, Zakia. One day, I would really like to sail to the land of Hang Tuah and Tun Teja. Please pray for me. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Attack! Oh... Yahya (4x) Wait, Apuak! Don't attack just yet. Wait! Though now she's gone You shouldn't be sad She's now in Malacca be happy together with the nature and your friends Time will answer everything Everyone is happy Everyone is playing and happy Don't be to arrogant Hey! A new Toy! Come play at my house! Play by your self! Oh... Yahya (2x) Thanks. Granny. You’ve known grandpa Tan since you were kids. Hopefully, I can get honest answers from you. How I finally end up here, in this village? Just the two of us. That seems unlikely, don't you think? After high school, Tan left this village. No one knew where he went. He never went home, but once. When his mother died. - His father? - Died long time ago. When Tan was still a baby. None of the villagers really knew where, and what his job was when he was away. We did not even know his wife. Whether his kids take after his good looks, or are pretty like his wife. No news at all. Nobody knew. Exactly eight years ago, he came home with a two-year-old baby. That baby was you, Yahya. Truly a masterpiece, Mr Tan. I didn't expect to see this at all. Crushing a ceramic teapot into gravel. I didn’t know you can get upset, too, after all. Surely you wouldn't mind passing it on, would you? Teach me, Mr. Tan. Sure. - I'll leave you to it for now. - Yes. After hundreds of rings, this is the first time I see your painting. It is really beautiful. Hopefully, everyone who wears your rings, lives happily. Some of their children are probably in the elementary school by now. Of course! You've been working here for eight years. - Really? - Yes. Is that so? Let me take some pictures to be sent to Muchtar. May I? No more Mr. Muchtar? No. Yes, go ahead. VILLAGE HEAD CANDIDATES 2020-2025 PERIOD 01 HILMA (LEMAN) SUKUR 02 RAMLI NAWAWI S.H. Who did this? All ballot papers are wet, aren't they? - Be careful. - Will do. You'll be leaving with Mr. Malin in a moment, Mr. Tan. I'd like to cherish this moment with my grandson. Let’s have a seat first. Maybe Mr. Muchtar wasn't being serious when he invited you for a coffee at his place. He wasn’t aware the dowry would be this big in the first place. I want to thank him in person. Many years ago, I made an art work, only once, that had so much meaning to me. After that, not even one. Until I painted this one. Yahya is going back to school next Monday. I’d like to take him to Bukik Gadang with me. But, it is really far. The happiness is worth the trip. It shouldn’t be any problem, I guess. Can I please have the address? He lives not far from Nurul Huda mosque. This is Maturi. From here, take a turn to Bukik Gadang. See, not this way. Take the roundabout, instead. - Do not take the wrong turn, sir. - Yes. - Thank you. - You are welcome. I am leaving. You got it? - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Oh God. - Going somewhere, sir? - Home. - Be careful. - Okay. Doing laundry? What do you have there? Brand new TV, huh? - What's that, Mr. Tan? - It’s nothing. Let see who will win. - Play nicely, kids. - Yes, Grandpa. Be careful! Gasoline. - Where are you going, Mr. Tan? - Home. - Can I borrow this? - Sure. Yahya! Come here for a second. Oh God. Where could it be? Yahya. Have you seen my key? A small one. It says “Tan”, “1968” on the other side. Grandpa. Thanks. I am going to travel far, to Bukik Gadang. Fancy joining me? It’ll be a beautiful closure for your school break. No. Okay, just be careful at home. Do you want to see my painting? Alright then. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - When was this thing made, Grandpa? - '63. When I was in high school, I rode this to Koto Rang Agam. Grandpa! Open it, Grandpa. Afdal! - Yes? - Lend me your helmet. Where are you going? What is it all about, Grandpa? We're going to learn from mother nature. What’s next? Yah. In the name of Allah. What’s next? - Ready? - Ready! In the name of Allah. Hey, It's our responsibility! Zakia! Oh, hi. You should have checked everything first, Grandpa. When traveling, no one really knows what might happen. We're lucky this didn't happen at the downhill back there. So, how long haven't you ridden this Vespa? 50 years. Can you replace the clutch cable? Absolutely, sir. But, this might take some time. - I have to buy diapers for my baby first. - No worries. - I will have some meal nearby first. - Yes. Check the oil as well. What did Apuak mean by being responsible? So, here is the story. ELECTION IS CANCELED BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS WASHED THE BALLOT PAPER UNDER INVESTIGATION - So, that was you guys? - Yes. May I know, why? Both candidates are pathetic, Grandpa. If uncle Leman becomes the village head, he will spend the youth budget at grandma Piah's coffee shops. And Mr. Ramly, Pendi’s father... I really don't like him. Because of his son? Even worse, Grandpa. One afternoon before the election, Mr.Ramli gave Apuak’s mother some money. He said it was a thank you gesture for Rendang (meal). That's money politics, Grandpa! True. That's just sad. That's indeed sad. Pictures of them in the cold. Young man, where did you move my painting to? I don't know, sir. There was a black pickup truck stopping by, then there was a man coming out… - from the workshop. - May God forgive me. - Is it done? -Yes, it's done. Which way? That way, sir. - A black pickup truck, right? - Yes. Thanks, Uncle. Grandpa! That looks like a pickup truck. Over there! - Yes, it does. - Let's go! - Come on, Grandpa! - Yes, there it is. Oh, no! May God forgive me. - They've gone far, Grandpa. - Yes. - Get ready! - Don't do it, Grandpa! Let's roll! Excuse us. Excuse us, ma'am. Excuse us, sir. Excuse us, ma'am. Excuse us. - To the right, Grandpa! - That way! - Right! - No, that way! Let's go, Grandpa! Yahya, hurry up. I'm eating your Lupis. Grandpa, don't. - Yum-yum. - Just a minute, Grandpa. - Grandpa, that's the pickup truck! - Yes. That way! Let's go, Grandpa. This chicken is our sacrifice for the welfare. This chicken is our sacrifice for the blessings. Behind that crowd, Grandpa. What ceremony is this? Mr. Tan? Yahya is also with you. - How are you doing, Mr. Tan? I didn't know you're coming. - Yes. Yahya, come. Let me take you to where you belong. Sister, please give him what he wants. Once the ceremony is finished, we'll have a big meal with your grandpa. I'll leave you here for now. In the name of Allah. Mr. Tan. Hey! You've been told to behave, haven't you? Everyone's busy working, not eating. I'll throw you into that pond. Go and take a bath. Naughty boy! I would've been happy, if my mother had gotten mad at me. May God forgive me. What's the matter, Mr Tan? Villagers here do believe in God, don't they? They do. But this is the tradition that our ancestors have taught us for generations. Is something wrong? Traditions should be in accordance with Sharia. If this is the case, - it is completely the opposite. - Hush! Hey, someone here is insulting our ancestors! Be calm, sir. My friend there is a little mad. Please ignore everything he says. Nonsense! He has to be fined a buffalo. - I don't think that's necessary, sir. - You've insulted our ancestors. He doesn't understand our customs and traditions here. Catch him! Please, Mr. Datuk. Sir! Speed up, Mr. Tan! Speed up! Grandpa, wait for me! Yahya! Grandpa, wait for me! Grandpa, don't leave me to die here! It's me, Yahya. Grandpa, look back! Sir, go after him. Come on, sir. Grandpa! Grandpa, wait for me. Don't leave me. Grandpa! It's me, Yahya. Your back! It's me, Grandpa! Faster, sir. Grandpa! Grandpa! Wait for me! Look back, Grandpa! It's me, Yahya. Ugh! Give it to that man. Sir, please take this for the horse. Buy the horse some coke for a treat. Please, it's nothing. - Thanks. - Anytime. - Hey, kid. - Yes? - Take this for him. - Sure, thanks. Why did you leave me? I didn't want to die there. So, you'd rather have my blood taken for the house foundation of those heretics. Is that it? A black pickup truck. - Let's go. Wait, that's different, Grandpa. - Different how? That's a different black pickup truck from the earlier one. - It's the same. Can't you see? Hurry, hop on! - If you say so. KOTO RANG AGAM Grandpa. What happens to that kid? Fahmi, why are you crying? I went to pee, and my bus left. - Are your parents in the bus? - Yes. - Which way did the bus go? - That way. Come. - Hold on. What color is the bus? - White. White. What kind of parents leaving their children unattended like this? Which bus your mom is on? That one? - Is that the bus? - Yes, that's the bus. Come on, Grandpa. - Tika, isn't that your son? - Are you sure? - It's your son, Fahmi. - Yes, you're right. Mr driver, stop. Stop! - Come on, Fahmi. - Get off the motorbike. - That's your mother. - Yes. Thank God. Thanks. Do you want to join us for a meal? No, thanks. Ma'am. If my mother was alive, she would never leave me, like you left him. Let's go, Grandpa. Let's take a selfie, post it on Instagram story. and send the picture to dad, - Grandpa. - Um. If a painting is transported by a pickup truck, does it always go to a gallery? That's how it normally works, or directly to the collector. You seem to know a lot about painting sales. Nurma told me that. Interested, sir? Beautiful. Young man. In this city, which galleries exhibit texture paintings like these? There are only two galleries in this city. FINDING TAN Thank you. You crossed the red light, Grandpa. - Police officers! - They're chasing us, Grandpa! Run away! - They're getting closer, Grandpa. - Yes. It fells like 40 years ago! I'm not old enough for this, Grandpa! This way! - Grandpa! - Not that way! - Excuse us, ma'am. - Down to this path! Out off the way! Kids, out of the way! - Out of the way, sir! - Hey, watch it! Out of the way! - Police! - Where? - Let's go! - Yes! Be careful, Grandpa! Chickens! Come on, Grandpa. - Faster, Grandpa. - Yes. Be careful. Hold tight. THIS CITY IS NOT FOR SALE What happens, Grandpa? I don't know. Why didn’t we just tell the police that you rarely came to town and wasn't aware of the stop sign? Their helmets are too big to listen to our little voice. They rode a car, no helmet was worn. That was a figure of speech. That was an excuse. If only they were smarter, they would've chased us with motorcycle. Grandpa. Is it true? My parents died when I was one year old? But why weren't there any pictures of me with them? Were they happy when I was born? Maybe that's the truth. Please, Grandpa. I am ready to listen to your story. I've been circumcised, which means I'm now mature enough. You told me in the mosque back then. Nothing is certain in this world, but one thing, death. This afternoon, this evening, or tomorrow, we could die anytime. Would you rather let me die before knowing my parents' names and how they died? Would you rather leave me forever before telling me the truth? Yahya. Some stories are better left untold to let us live peacefully. You need to move on from all these things. Why? Because all the ways to survive that I know, I have passed them on to you. Slowly, one lesson at a time, in the mosques, in coffee shops, in sports arenas. From what I've seen, you have a remarkable character to continue your passage. There is no reason for you to feel weak just because of a story. How did they actually die, grandpa? Our journey is still far from end, son. We have to accomplish this task. If I am not mistaken, I've informed you that the wedding is tomorrow. But, I beg your pardon, why the dowry hasn't been delivered yet? It might be there in no time, Mr. Muchtar. Mr. Tan himself is delivering the dowry. Mr. Tan himself? I see, if that's the case. Please give me Mr. Tan's phone number, so I can give him the best route to get here. Thank you. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Such a nice lady. And pretty. Don't stop stirring. That one, Grandpa. I'm pretty sure. Be careful, Grandpa. They say maturity doesn't mean age, but sensitivity, manners and how you react. Huh. Many claims to be rich, but build it on stolen goods. Hey, old man. There is no single rule in the world, that allows trespassing. Hey, young man. There is no law that allows one to steal. Make yourself clear. Open your trunk. I'll take what's mine, and leave. As simple as that. Want some? WOMEN FASHION STORE Just take one. There are so more and more unstable young people in this country, because the elderly don't want to listen to themselves. Hubby! A phone call for you. What's in the trunk, Grandpa? Fish feed. - Let's take some, Grandpa. - No. Get on! He said we could have some. Hallo? Peace be upon you, Mr. Tan. Yes, Nurma. Where you at, sir? Yes. Thank God the traffic is good. A black pickup truck! We can't do that, Grandpa! Turn left, Grandpa! It was there! The black pickup truck! Hallo? Hallo, sir? Hallo? ANDAM SARI GALLERY I should've followed my guts. After that black pick-up! We've seen so many black pick-ups in so many different shapes. Do you want to search the whole town and stop all black pick-ups one by one? Do you have a better clue than "a black pickup truck"? Tell me! Hey, you! Come here! Come! Why is this gallery not open? Why is it closed? Are you hiding something in there? Yahya! Get in! I don’t even know what the painting looks like. Enough, Grandpa! Calm down, Grandpa. There has to be another way. It's okay. Calm down, Grandpa. Kid. Hey. Grandpa. Grandpa. Yes. Let's try. MAHYRA'S ART SALE THE BIGGEST AUCTION HOUSE IN ASIA Yes. MAHYRA'S ART SALE SEARCHING THE MEANING OF MALAYA Yahya. TUXEDO ETHNIC WEAR Grandpa. Just wait here, Grandpa. Wow! Grandpa. There are so many paintings inside. But, I couldn’t confirm which one is yours. I am so sorry for not looking at your painting before we left. It's okay, son. Even if it's there, we still can't get in. A huge exhibition like that is very exclusive. How do you know? Nurma told me once. Grandpa. We can simply tell them, that we want to go inside, to look for your painting. Go in. If it’s there, take it, if not then we go home. That’s it. Should be easy, right? Well, we can try that. MR. TANS'S MOBILE CAN'T BE REACHED. ARE YOU SURE HE'S OKAY, MISS? Peace be upon you, Mr. Amir. Oh, God. Check that! Your scooter. May God forgive me. Umar? Tan? May God forgive me. - Tan? - Yes? May God forgive me. In high school, your grandpa liked quoting Buya Hamka's words. He painted him and hang it on the school walls. He had this dream of traveling around the world like the well-known scientist, Ibnu Batutah. However, after finishing high school, he went away with no news until today. Yahya, - Do you know why he ran away? - Why? Because your grandpa was hunted by lots of girls back then. Grandpa… - ...captured everyone's interest. - Yes, everyone. We can see that... Do you know what this painting tells you? Why the face is covered... I love it. Especially for the color combination. It's brilliant, I love it. Found it, Grandpa? It's not supposed to be here. Why not? Usually, an auction and exhibition this big, announces the painters and their paintings a year in advance. How do you know these things? Nurma told me. What does your painting look like? Too bad you didn’t see it. That one, Grandpa? - No. - That one? - Excuse me, sir. - Oh, thank you. That one? No. - That one? - No. Must be this one? That one is too big. I have a feeling here that all of you would give your best offer.. - This is an auction, Grandpa. - Yes. Let's begin with the first painting. Please. Wow. We will start from… 50 million. Yes! 55 million. 55 million! Okay? 70 million. 70 million! Yes? 125 million. 130 million. Anyone else? 130 million, going once. 130 million, going twice. 130 million, third and final call! Not that one, right? No. 85 million. - Yes? - 87 million. - Yes? - 92 million. Yes? - 110 million? - 110 million. Anyone else? 110 million, going twice. 110 million, final call. I had the chance to talk with the painter. He spent four years. And we will open it at… 112 million. 114 million. 114 million! 117 million. 138 million. - Yes? - 145 million. 145 million. Amazing! Do we have more? 145 million… Final call! 948 million, going twice! Going once! 948 million, going twice! 948 million, final call! We'd like to invite dear Ibrahim to join us on the stage. And this one is the one that we've been talking about. Exceptional. Not in the catalogue, yet exquisite. An art piece by Djunaedi Masri. Two of his work of art are in today's auction. That's it. - That's your painting? - Wow! It's hard for me to explain this. But, we will open this from… 188 million. Yes! 250 million. 250 million! Yes? 325 million. 325 million! Anyone else? 340 million. 340 million! Anyone else? How much? 450 million. 450 million! Do we have more? Yes! 769 million. Amazing. 769 million! Anyone else? Yes! One point two billion. One point two billion! Anyone else? One point two billion, going once! One point two billion, going twice! One point two billion… Excuse me, sir! Could I please meet the agent or the painter in person? Right. Where did you put your signature on this painting? Here. Is that how you maintain your reputation? Can easily be erased by anyone, at anytime? You are an artist, aren't you? Yes. This painting is… created by… Tan... Al-... Maturi. This is my painting. The one that this afternoon… either this guy or whoever was involved in this whole thing, and of course a black pick-up, at a motorcycle repair shop, on the border of Madania and Koto Rang Agam. I'm taking what's mine. I'm offering you two billion rupiahs for the painting. Tan Al-Maturi. A painter the pride of South East Asia. He won the Nobel Peace Prize for his painting that was considered a comfort for the Western and Eastern bloc tension, after the Second World War. to Mr. Tan Al-Maturi. Thank you very much. I will be honored to receive the prize. His paintings were worth billions of dollars. All of his exhibitions were great success. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a very special evening for France because now we can admire the magnificent painting of Monsieur Tan. Thank you very much. This is my root. After his wife passed away, he… went missing… together with his grandson. The media believes Tan and his grandson were kidnapped due to a political conspiration in Asia. The news is published, sir. Okay. Thank you. Since then, no one knew the whereabouts of Tan and his grandson. If my guess is proven to be true, this will be a headline all over the world. Apparently, here you are. This painting is not for sale. It was specially made for someone as a dowry. I'm just a hired painting artist from a village. Yahya. Let's go, son. Sir, I have a few questions. You're a liar. That man said that we were kidnapped. Who kidnapped us? Who did? Such a generous kidnapper. Taking us to this village. Or probably it was you who kidnapped me. Or may be I am not even your grandson, old man. I don’t even know who I am, who my parents were, and who you are, old man. My life with your grandmother, was too beautiful. Highly respected by everyone. Our son, Rahman, your father, such a handsome little boy. We sent him to reputable college. But at the same time, he lost me since he was little. Daddy, You're coming to my school, right? Rahman. Let Grandpa and Grandma take you to school, okay? Even so, all teachers, all parents, know who your father is. Please, sir. Give me two more months. I'll finish the remaining three paintings. What? But exhibitions are not everything, sir! Daddy. What now? Go study with your mom! Greedy broker! Rahman. Come here, son. I realized, I didn't have what it took to raise your father. He grew up with the faith and belief that were passed down. But he lacked of character that he could look up to. Therefore, he turned into a lost soul. Honey. I don't need to explain to you the pain of giving birth, do I? I don't want to bathe the baby. Nanny... If we take Yahya to London, who is going to take care of him there? I don't want to leave him with some baby sitter. Do you want your grandson died of poisoning? Or, when I return from the campus, I suddenly find him dead inside a washing machine. No, Mom. I don't want all that. That's why, I beg you, to take care of Yahya here. I promise I'll always come home every school break. Always come home. I give you my word, Dad. We'll make your dream come true, and become the youngest professor of this country. Please, mom. If that is really your intention to leave, we can only give our blessings. Let Yahya stay here. We'll wait for you. [Praying] Your mom and dad never came home to see you. To see us. TOMB OF TAN'S WIFE My calls were never connected. My texts and emails were never replied. I guess it served me right. 23 NOVEMBER: RAHMAN'S RETURN 24 NOVEMBER 2011 Taking you to our hometown, was your grandmother last wish. So that you'll be brought up in a highly civilized society. May be this is my way of starting a new life all over again. To become common people and redeem my mistakes Please forgive me, Yahya. Soon enough, I promise that I'll tell you everything. Hopefully, the tire can last until the nearest repair shop. Bear with me. Yes, Grandpa. Let me borrow this. Grandpa. - Yes? - You can wait here. Uncle Garin here said that the place isn't far from here. He can take me there. From the mosque, take the downhill. There's a wheel repair shop across the road. Yes. In that case, I'll wait at the repair shop. Okay, Grandpa. - Ready? - Ready! Yahya. Be careful. Yes, Grandpa. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Actually, I met him yesterday in my wife's village. He came with his grandson. There was a ceremony going at the village. If I'm not mistaken, he was wearing a brown jacket. Brother, do you know where Muchtar lives? They've gone to the mosque. - Make a left and it's on your right. - Thanks. Thank God, we're finally here. [Wedding sermon] But where's Mr. Tan? He's at the repair shop close to the mosque where he works. Yes. I'm a mosque keeper in Koto Kaciak. Yes, it's near. Well then, please send my gratitude to Mr. Tan. I'm the one who should be thanking you. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. WHEEL REPAIR Give me a hand. Oh, God. I'D LIKE TO ORDER A SIMILAR ONE THAT SAYS "MUCHTAR AND NURMA" TO MR. TAN There was, indeed, a little problem with the villagers at that time. Never mind. Case closed. We found him. What? Sister? You found him? You're really awesome, sir. I bet you were a vespa enthusiast long time ago. These days, young people have no idea of your trick here. MISSING FOR 10 YEARS, TAN AL-MATURI SEEN AT MAHYRA'S ART SALE, INDONESIA There is no God but Allah. REPAIR SHOP: THE WHEEL OF LIFE Sir. Uncle Garin, can I ask you something? Sure. Which is the best restaurant around here? There's one close to the repair shop. Do you want to go there now? No. I'd like have a feast with grandpa later.
