(SOMBER MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) Who the fuck has been using my straightening iron again?! WOMAN AT MIRROR: Here we go again, fucking drama queen. I told you to stop using my shit, Aleisha! Nobody wants to use your cheep dollar store flat iron. BLONDE: Whatever trick! WOMAN: Hey, you're Lena, right? Uh huh. So Kami told me you sold her some good scripts. Is that true? Are you a junkie? WOMAN: Are you serious? Yeah, you know, like a drug addict. WOMAN: Do I look like a drug addict to you? No offense but kind of. I'm just asking you for some help. That's it. Fair enough. All right. Don't ever use the product's name and if I get wind that you told anybody where you got it, I cut you off and we don't know each other. Okay, I got it. 50 up front, leave the rest in there when I make the drop tomorrow. Okay? (INTENSE BEAT MUSIC) (CLUB COMMOTION) Hey, watch the bar for me. (INTENSE BEAT MUSIC) Hey, did you guys see Lena? I ain't seen her. Really? I'm glad to see you guys are on it, thanks. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DISTANT POLICE SIREN) (TRAIN RUMBLING) (TRAIN RUMBLING) (BELL RINGING) (TRAIN RUMBLING) (DOOR CREAKING) Just be cool. Okay, after you. (DOOR CREAKING) Just go in. Just do some studying tonight, okay? That's all I wanna do, just study. (KEYPAD BEEPING) After you. (FAINT TELEVISION COMMOTION) Jesus Christ! What the fuck are you doing here? Don't worry. I was just on my way out. What the hell, Ben, who is that? Um. You need to leave. I do not want to call the cops. LENA: How old is this one? BEN: You coulda called, you know? I do call. You don't answer. Yeah, well, you know how it is. Yeah. I know how it is. Well, I guess I'll just leave you to it. That's it? You're not gonna put up a fight? Nope. What's this? It's all in there. Have fun with Malibu Barbie. (THUDDING) (HUFFING) You okay? Yeah. What's wrong? (GROANING) Nothing is wrong. That was romantic. I'm sorry. Come on, you know I'm just kidding. I know you have a lot on your mind. I'll go make the coffee. Okay. (SIGHING) (SIGHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (TEAPOT WHISTLING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Thank you. Careful. So what time are you meeting me? Yeah, about that. Um. Unbelievable. You forgot, didn't you? No, I didn't forget. I just didn't get the time off yet Are you serious? You just wait till today to bring this up? Well, if you would've reminded me last night... No, no, no, no, you are not turning this around on me. You just told me the other day that you were getting your shift covered. All right, I know, okay? But the new guy is a real fucking prick and especially with all the cutbacks going on right now, I didn't wanna get on anybody's shit list. Just remind him, I mean, what's the problem? I doesn't work like that. We need the overtime. You know that. Great. I'll just go by myself because that won't be embarrassing. Oh, hey, come on. Don't overreact. We'll reschedule it. It'll be fine. I bet I can get the time off next week. I don't get you. You were just saying how important this is to you and now you act like it's not a big deal. I mean, what am I supposed to think, Jared? I don't know, what do you want me to say?! Plus, I already changed my schedule so I'm closing tonight. Just don't go. What, you hate that job anyway, right? You've been talking about quitting for months. You're being an asshole. I'm being an asshole? Yeah, you're being an asshole. Why because I'm just repeating what you've been telling me? Huh? Or am I crazy now? No, I'm the one that's crazy. I really must be. I mean, all we do is argue and I'm sick and tired of it. Come on, we're figure this out. No, you'll figure it out. Sara! (WAVES SLOSHING) (SEAGULL SQUAWKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (FAINT MUSIC) Morning. I think you mean afternoon. Yeah, I woke up like 20 minutes ago, so it's morning. You're late again. So? What're you, gonna nark on me? Kevin's really pissed. Shit. I'm gonna have to listen to him give his gay little punctuality speech again. That's real mature. (CHUCKLING) Are you gonna help me here or just text on your phone? Oh my God, you are so mean. Calm down for a second. Rough night? Yeah, kinda. Okay, what has been going on between you two? He's just acting like a little bitch, that's all. What did you do? Nothing, I swear. I know, I know. He was wasted, I doubt he even remembers. Here he comes. GREG: Hi, Peter. Fuck you, Greg. (GASPING) (SAW BUZZING) Hey, Rick. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? As long as it doesn't cut into my lunch hour. Last week I put in a request for leave. I just never heard back if it was approved or not. Did you talk to Monica? She's HR, not me. Yeah, she said she was just waiting for your sign off, so. You know we have a deadline here, right? Yeah, I'm fully... And you also know we'll be handing out a lot of overtime in the next six months. Since you're having personal problems, I suppose I can take you off the OT roster. No, no, I didn't mean it like that. Hey. Hey, man, I just need a couple hours off early. Two. I'll give you an hour. Take it or leave it. (FAINT ROCK MUSIC) (TRAFFIC COMMOTION) I thought I'd find you here. A little busy. Yeah, you look swamped. Why can you never make an appointment? Why would I do that? I did some digging. This case, it's pretty similar. Check it out. It's Michigan State. So? It's a different state set in different laws. Plus, we already lost your appeal. Well, can't we take it higher or can't you make a case for reinstatement like this guy did? You could. Wouldn't matter. What're you saying, I should give up? I didn't say that. They got some serious dirt on you. Come on. You know I didn't cheat. Whatever. Semantics. Look, I hate what that guy did to you, but you've got to look at this from a purely legal standpoint. So I guess the law doesn't care about the truth. (SIGHING) Lena, it's not like you lost everything. Listen, I'll call you if I hear anything about the appeal. In the meantime, try to stay out of trouble. See you. (TRAFFIC COMMOTION) (CAR BEEPING) I'm sorry. Yeah. Thanks for cleaning up. All right. During your last visit, you described having symptoms of irregular bleeding and menstrual cramps outside of your menstrual cycle. Mhmm. We did find some cysts on your cervix that we'd like to know more about. So something is wrong? Well, most of the time when we get results like this it's for something completely benign. However, I would like to schedule an appointment next week so that I can take a closer look. Then we find some answers? Well, it's the best place to start. The biopsy will give us a more in depth explanation. What if it comes back as something serious? The good thing is that you came in early and the cysts are very small. Well what're we supposed to do in the meantime? (KNOCKING) (GROWLING) (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (GROWLING) (GUNSHOTS BOOMING) (VIDEO GAME COMMOTION) MAN: Hey, Lena. Come on back. LENA: Who's the kid? My nephew. MAN: Katie's having me watch him for the day. LENA: He's cute. You sure you're related? (FAINT BEAT MUSIC) MAN: All new product here. Mostly homegrown hydro. Very clean, very high quality strands and some real choice terpenes. Now, if you wanna talk about a real step up in quality. So what am I looking at? I just sell the stuff, I don't come up with the names. How much? Retail on the Lobster is 400 an ounce. But, as always, you get friend prices, so 350. Fuck, are you serious? MAN: Supply and demand's a real bitch these days. Go ahead, free sample. LENA: No, I gotta work. MAN: Suit yourself. All right, give me it all. MAN: Which one? The stupid Red Lobster shit or whatever. If it goes fast, I'll come back for more. You'll definitely be back. Gotta love strippers. Sure you can't stay? I just scored the Raiders trilogy on laserdisc. Nah, I can't tonight, man. Rain-check though, yeah? MAN: You don't know what you're missing. Hey, aren't you worried about your nephew smelling that? Problem solved. (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) Hey. Boss lady wants to see you. About what? What do you think? (INTENSE BEAT MUSIC) No, you listen to me, Antonio. Do you know how long I've been doing business with your family? You tell your father I want a discount on the next shipment. Grazie, Ciao. So what's up? John John said you wanted to see me. I don't know, you tell me. Okay, look, I'm going to cut you a little break. I know you're new around here so you haven't had a chance to see how I do things. I don't know what you mean by that. Come on, Lena, cut the crap. Just so you know, I've been hustling longer than you've been in a bra. I gave you this job because you gave me the impression that you were smart. Now I feel like, I don't know, you're going out of your way to prove me wrong or something. It's not the worst thing going on around here. What you girls do on your own time, that's your business, but when you bring it into my house, then it becomes my business. You feel me? Yeah, I feel you. Good. Now go out there, earn a living. (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) (PHONE BUZZING) Hey. Yeah, I know, I got your messages. I'm actually a little busy right now. I'll see you tomorrow. (GASPING) (CHUCKLING) You missed a spot. Hey. What's gotten into you? Doctor's orders. (PHONE ALARM BEEPING) You gonna get that? It's Rick. Fuck. He wants me to go in. It's fine, go ahead. Look, hey. How about we pick this up when I get home, huh? That's romantic. What makes you think I'm gonna be in the mood at four in the morning? What makes you think I was gonna wake you at four in the morning? Oh, God. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I was kidding. Yeah, that's the problem. What is that supposed to mean? It means... Fuck, I don't know what it means. Babe. Hey, hey. Relax. All right, we have a plan. We're sticking to that. Yeah, I know, we had a plan. I just feel like everything keeps getting in the way. Like what? - I don't know. - GREG: Hello! (DOOR THUDDING) You've gotta get that fucking key back. GREG: I'm sorry, am I interrupting something? Greg. Hi, Jarrod. Is everything okay? Yeah, it's just a stupid thing. Okay, well, I know what you're gonna say, so don't bother. And I'm willing to ignore the fact that you've been screening my texts all day. What're you doing here? Okay, I don't know what's going on with you and I honestly couldn't care less, but you need to hurry up and get ready because you're coming out tonight. No, it's bad timing. Yeah, preciously why I'm here. You need to go change because you look like a poor person. Look around, I am a poor person. Yes but that doesn't mean you have to look like one. Okay, you're not blind, right? Means you could see what was just going on? I'm really not in the mood to go out. Oh my, you're not gonna go away if I say no, are you? Probably not. Fine, I'll go. Girl, that's my girl! Let me just do the dishes. Mind if I knosh real quick? Yeah, that's fine, just don't eat Jarrod's Kung Pao. Wait, a brewery? Yes, a brewery. Come on, remember we talked about being open to new places? Yeah but... Well this is new places. Come on, don't be such a square. Fine, fine, fine. Dress like a poor person, drink like a poor person.

No, I'm just right down the street. Come on, it's the least I can do. You helped me out. No, I'm good. Okay, thanks again. You might wanna crack a window. Good idea. (CHUCKLING) (DOOR CREAKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) MAN: You coulda called if you were gonna be this late. I'm sorry, I lost track of time. Yeah, those new smartphones do everything but tell time, huh? So what's new? Quite a lot, actually. Hospital's building a new wing and they want me to head up the new Post-Op Unit. Look at you. I could keep you up-to-date if you were around more. I'm just keeping busy, you know how it goes. Yeah. Yeah, I do. WAITRESS: More coffee, y'all? I'm good. Thanks. WAITRESS: What can I get for you? Oh, I'm good, thanks. WAITRESS: You sure? Stick around, have something to eat. I'm not hungry. Indulge your old man. (FAINT MUSIC) I told you I don't need it. Most people say thanks when they're handed an envelope full of cash. I make more than that in a weekend. But where does it go? What're you trying to say? I've got a lot of connections in this town. Why don't you let me talk to a few people? Call in some favors. Story of my life. You always pulling strings for me. If I didn't do it, who the hell will? If I take your money, you promise never to bring this up again? Deal. Well, thanks for the pep talk. I'm probably wasting my breath, but you know Victoria would like you to come over. She wants to cook for you. I doubt I'd make for good company. That's not fair. I'm just being honest. Great. You finally decided to be honest just to dis me. Oh, come on, who's being dramatic now? You know, for what it's worth, Lena, I did the best I could to do right by you. See you around, sweetheart. (GUITAR TUNE) Hey, hon. Hey. What? We saved some this month. Oh yeah? Yeah. Nice. Why don't we do something fun tonight? You know I start going in early tonight. Right, right. But I'd love to. I know, I know. (GUITAR STRUMMING) I'm gonna go jump in the shower. (PHONE JINGLE RINGING) Hello? GREG: Gorgeous, what're you doing? Just hanging out. Why? GREG: Great, I'm coming over. Wait. What? Why you coming over? What time is it? GREG: I'll brief you in person. Just make sure you're ready when I get there. No, hold on, what're you talking about? (GREG GURGLING) GREG: You're breaking. (GREG GURGLING) I'll see you soon. Greg. Greg, hello? (PHONE BEEPING) Damn it. (SIGHING) Okay, enough with the secrecy. Where are we going? GREG: All right, you know that girl that like saved our lives the other night? SARA: Yeah. Well it's been driving me freaking nuts trying to remember where I know her from. I'm surprised you remember anything from that night. Oh wow, you're funny. Shut up, I'm telling a story. So last night I'm at Mecca hanging with my girl J-Rock and then, boom, I see her. Turns out she works their too. Awesome, what does that have to do with me? Oh, so we get to talking. It turns out we know a lot of the same people and she said that if we come in tonight, she'll get us comped at the bar. Seriously, that's what you wanted to do? Go drinking? Yeah, listen, we'll go for one drink and then we can bounce, I promise. I already told her we'd be there, so do not make me look like a flake. They say you only get two chances to make a first impression. They don't say that. I think they say that. Pretty sure it's one and you already blew that. Please? God, I really hate you sometimes. Yeah but the rest of the time, you love me. Okay, where is this place? I never heard of it. It's a surprise. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) SARA: Are you for real? GREG: Oh, come on, relax. Act like you've seen tits before. WOMAN: Hey, baby. Hi. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) Here you go. Your friend looks out of it. First time? Is it that obvious? What do you think? Should she fill out an application? She what she's working with under the jacket. Take it off. Stay. Just relax and enjoy the show, sweetheart. Speaking of shows, I'm up next so I'll come back and check on you guys later. All right, kill it. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) Hey, this place is cool, right? Where's the bathroom? Oh my God, go. I'll go get us drinks. (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) (GREG MUMBLING) Hey, everything come out okay? This is Steven? - This is my other half, Steven. - Heard a lot about you. Only the good stuff, I promise. Sure. Ready? - Yes. - Cheers. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) LENA: You guys lost again? Guys, this is Lena. Lena, Sara, Steven. - Hi. - Hey. By the way, you look fucking hot up there. Well, thank you. So what's going on? It looks like you're leaving. Yeah, we have a little bit of a situation to deal with. She's drunk. He's bring nice. I'm making him take me home. Well, at least he's standing on his own two feet. Wow, all right, all right. We're gonna bounce. Are you going to Chivo's thing? I'm not sure, are you guys going? Yes, we are going. Let's make it a foursome. LENA: Okay, see you there. All right. It's nice seeing you. LENA: You too. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Jesus. Where you been? I just stepped out with Greg. Lost track of time. I hope he had less than you. I just had a few drinks. Wait, wait, wait, why're you home? Is everything okay? Yeah, they had a delay on material, so they cut us early. You could've text me. Well my phone died. Didn't think I was gonna be out this late. And Greg's phone was dead too? (KISSES SMACKING) Is there anything else you wanna tell me? Why are you acting like this? Well I get a little worried when I come home to an empty house and missing wife. Sorry, warden, your right. Shoulda told you. Is that all or can I go back to my cell now? I didn't mean it that way. Fine, I'm sorry. Can we just drop it and go to bed? Fine. Fine. (SIGHING) Yeah, well couples fight. Comes with the territory. Yeah but this was different. Well maybe he's just being insecure. It's like he finally sees that you can have fun without him. I guess. Isn't his birthday coming up? Yeah, next week, why? I don't know, maybe you invite him out with you. Show him that he has nothing to worry about. We just have a lot going on right now. I don't even know what to get him this year. Maybe it's not something you get him. Maybe it's something you give him. Look, I don't claim to be an expert on relationships. Agreed? At least monogamous ones. But, and don't get mad at me for saying this, just seems like there's something, I don't know, a little bit off about you guys lately. - Where did that come from? - I don't know, I don't know. Never mind, forget I said anything. No, no, you can't do that. Spit it out. Look, I love Jarrod. I think he's a great guy and I know that you care about him a lot. I used to look at you two and think that I want something like that in my life. We're far from perfect, Greggy. Like I said, I'm no expert. I just don't like seeing you all torn up about it. I appreciate that. All right, switching gears. Are you coming? The beach thing. No, I doubt it. Oh, come on, what else do you have going on? I won't know anybody. You'll know me and Steven and Lena's gonna be there. Come on, please, I swear I won't leave your side the entire time. Please? Come on, please, please. I kinda like it when you beg. Okay, yeah, well don't get used to it. Come on. (SIZZLING) SARA: Something smells good. Damn right it does. Hope you're hungry. Starving actually. How'd you get home? Greggy gave me a ride. I would've picked you up. It's fine. We're on the same shift. You all right? Just exhausted. Hey, the clinic called. They want to schedule another appointment. I don't wanna think about that right now. Well, I've got some other news. We picked up another contract. Hey, that's great. Yeah, it's only temporary at first. So we'll see how it goes. That's good. So I'm not gonna be around the next couple of weeks much. You gonna be all right with that? I don't know. I mean, how could I possibly? The world's just so scary without my big man to take care of me. Well you could cash in that rain check from the other night. (GIGGLING) I can't tonight. I kinda have to go to this work thing with Greggy. I'm sorry. I mean, I don't have to go. No, it's fine, go. Have a good time. Are you sure? Yeah. Just don't have a great time or I'll take it personally. (FOOD SIZZLING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I swear to God, the dog is stealing my boyfriend. Are you gonna take my playboy home? They're making out and everything. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) LENA: Boo! - Hey! - Hey! Mind if I sit? Oh, sure, go ahead. No thanks, I'm good. It's not tobacco. I figured that. Just saying. So you went to ODU? Huh? Greg told me you went there. Oh, yeah, I did. I was planning on going there. You were? Mhmm. Why didn't you go? Well it was between going to college or starting a life with Jarrod, so I choose that one. (FIRE CRACKLING) When did you graduate? I didn't. But it's a long story, so. I'm not going anywhere. You sure you don't want any of this? What the hell? Yeah? Yeah, why not? - All right. - Okay. All right, so I'm nervous. You'll be fine. So you're gonna suck kinda hard, okay? Okay. Keep going. Yep. (COUGHING) I don't think I did that right. No, you did it just fine. - Trust me, the coughing helps. - Well, well, well. What're you two doing over here? Nothing. Um, holy shit, Sara, are you smoking weed? Like a champ. GREG: I have to capture this moment. No, don't. - Yes. - Come on, are you crazy? Oh, shut up, I'm not gonna post it, I just wanna have it. By the way, Lena, you gotta tell me your secret. I've been trying to get her to do adventurous shit for years. No secret, it was just her time. So, how are we feeling? Weird, I guess. - Yeah. - I guess. It's great, right? Yeah. Where have you been all night? Just being social. Hey, can you cover my shift on Thursday? I can't Thursday, it's Jarrod's birthday. Oh shit, fuck, that's right. I'll just call out sick, I guess. Have you decided what you're gonna do for him? No idea. I don't know. She can't decide where to take Jarrod for his birthday. I say she should just get him a round of golf at the country club. He doesn't golf. All straight men golf. What are you talking about? Whoa, whoa, okay. Well what is he into then? Oh my God, how high are you? (LAUGHING) I'm not. I don't know, I just wanna do something really special. Okay, well you gonna figure out how to do that on your budget? I have a great idea. (INTENSE ROCK MUSIC) Yes. Cool. Do you want a drink? Yeah. Can we get a vodka soda, bourbon soda?

It's okay, go ahead. Pretty hot, I'm not gonna lie. Look at him, he's blushing. I just don't get out to a lot of these types of places. Yeah, you better not be. Hey, we're gonna take really good care of you. Okay. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) JARROD: What, are you watching me? Yeah. You little creeper. (GIGGLING) SARA: Shut up. (MOANING) Thanks for last night. You had a good time? Yeah, I had fun. Good. Happy birthday. We need to get this hair cut. (LAUGHING) Are we okay? Yeah, of course we are. Why? No reason. I love you. Love you. (WATER SLOSHING) So what happened? Nothing you haven't heard before. I fell for another pretty-faced fuck boy who had no intention of being honest with me. What'd he lie about? Everything. I mean, like, everything. Were you in love with him? Maybe at one point. But I had my doubts more than anything. Well college guys can be real assholes. Professors can too. Professor? (CHUCKLING) So is your family from here? Just me, mostly. Parents? Father's around but we haven't really seen eye-to-eye for the last few years. Does he know where you work? He does now. SARA: Does he treat you different now? LENA: Sort of. I don't know. Think he just thinks he's taking care of me or something. SARA: I know what that's like. LENA: Really? Yeah. My mom wasn't too crazy about me marrying Jarrod right after high school. She just wanted me to go off to college and find some rich guy. When he could take it from there. It's funny. They raise us to be these strong, independent women and then they complain when we can't find a man to take care of us. Oh, what time is it? Almost six. Oh, I gotta go. I wanna beat Jarrod home so I can make him something to eat. Yeah, I should go too. Hey, why don't you come over? You can tell me more about this douche bag professor. Yeah, okay. I can always eat. SARA: Make yourself at home. Okay. Red or white? Red. Cool. And that's a deal breaker for you? If a guy can't get it that right, why am I gonna put in the time, you know? I guess. Does Jarrod still go down on you? Occasionally. Only occasionally? We're married. (LAUGHING) (DOOR OPENING) Babe! LENA: Speaking of the devil. JARROD: Hey. I'm a little drunk. Yeah, I can tell. (CHUCKLING) Hey, what's up, Lena? What's up, man? SARA: You smell. JARROD: I'm gonna go take a shower. (GIGGLING) LENA: I like him. Yeah, me too. I have an idea. If you trust me. What the hell is that? Remember that stuff you smoked the other night? This is just a little bit stronger. I don't know about this. Just watch me, okay? (OMINOUS MUSIC) It's not so bad, right? Okay. (COUGHING) You're okay. How're you feeling? (SOMBER BEAT MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) (KISSES SMACKING) (DRAMATIC BEAT MUSIC) (DRAMATIC BEAT MUSIC) (WATER TRICKLING) (DOOR CREAKING) What time you go in? I'm opening. I can take you. Greg's already on his way. You wanna talk? About what? Last night. Not really. You all right? I'm fine. You don't seem fine. I don't wanna talk about it. Well I guess I'll see you tonight then, huh? Can I pick you up, at least? (FAINT BEAT MUSIC) Hey, Sara, after you clock in, do you mind getting started on the patio? Sure. MAN: Have you seen Greg? Yeah, he's having a smoke. MAN: Of course he is. (SOMBER BEAT MUSIC) What're you doing here? I'm here to talk to Sara. Hey. Can we talk? I'm busy. It's kind of important. God, I feel like an idiot. Let me explain. Go ahead, because I don't even know what to think right now. Look, I woke up this morning and I looked over at you two and I realized that I'm the third wheel. I don't wanna be the third wheel. Stop. I wanna be close to you, you know? And I know that that sounds stupid. But my brain's just crazy and I have to tell you how I feel. I'm married. Okay, I love my husband. And last night we cheated on each other. Do you even understand how big of a deal that is to me? You look me in the eye and you tell me you feel nothing. And if you don't, I'll go. I'm sorry, okay? Last night was just a huge mistake. Never should've happened. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I can't see you anymore. Can you just respect that? Fine. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You okay? (FAINT PIANO MUSIC) There's a new bank going up. SARA: Looks like it. GREG: Maybe they're hiring. I can stop. SARA: Why? Because I just said, maybe they're hiring. So you want me to work at a bank? You know what? Forget about it. No, say it. Say you want me to work at a fucking bank. You're the one who wants a better job. Did it ever occur to you that I might be okay with the job I have? What the fuck is going on in your head, huh? I'm out there busting my fucking ass so we can start a family! And you're playing house with a goddamn stripper?! I don't want you seeing her anymore! And that's gonna fix it? It's that simple? You fucked her! I fucked her too. Don't follow me. (THUDDING) (GROANING) (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) Hey there, sweetie. GUY: Hi. What's your name? Have a seat. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) Just relax, I'm gonna give you a good time, okay? Hey, what did I just tell you? Fuck you, I paid for this! Give me a descent fucking dance. That's all I want. Last try. (INTENSE TECHNO BEAT MUSIC) Come on. Let go of me! Hey! Give me back my fucking money! This is bullshit! (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) Hey, what happened in there? Are you okay? LENA: Just some creep. I'm fine. Why don't you head out tonight? I need to cut some staff and you look like you could use a break. LENA: Thank you. All right, well get some rest and call me later, okay? (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) (GAGGING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Hey! (THUDDING) Fucking slut! (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SLAPPING) (LAUGHING) (GAGGING) (THUDDING) (MAN GROANING) If it doesn't fit, don't force it. I think this one's defective. (LAUGHING) Why is it that none of my pieces are defective? I don't know. Mhmm. That's why I picked you. Thanks for that. There you go. Look, I got one. (LAUGHING) You're not very good at this puzzling thing. (BANGING) (KNOCKING) FATHER: Lena, my God! (Lena crying) What happened? I got jumped. What? (LENA CRYING) Did you see him? - Yeah. - Did you see him? Who was it? He was some asshole at the club. Okay, were you hurt? Show me where you're hurt. Now try to breathe, now. Breathe, okay? (CRYING) WIFE: Oh, Jesus. Call the ER. It's too late, tell them to meet us there. No, I don't wanna go. - You gotta go. - No, I don't wanna go. You gotta go, honey, you gotta go. You gotta go. (LENA CRYING) Breathe, sweetheart, you gotta breathe. Just breathe. (LENA CRYING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TRAFFIC WHOOSHING) (KNOCKING) Hey. Easy. You look like hell. Shut up. Are you feeling any better? I'll live. I don't know if you know this but the police have the guy. Yeah, my boss texted me like a hundred times. (CHUCKLING) I do have some good news though. Got a phone call last night. The university. They wanna settle. I don't know what you said to get that prick to sign the papers but whatever it was, it worked. (LAUGHING) So it's over? It's over. You won. So what's next? (WATER TRICKLING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hope I got enough. Grabbed everything that looked clean. That's great. Thanks. Okay. I'll let you get dressed. Breakfast should be ready in a minute. Hey, dad? It's good to be home. (KNOCKING) Hey. Hi. Is Sara here? No, she's out. Can I talk to you for a minute? (CHUCKLING) Just one minute, please. (BIRDS CHIRPING) What happened to you? (CHUCKLING) You should see the other guy. Yeah, I bet. I just want to clear up a few things. Had some really weird shit happen recently. No. Stop. Well. I get it. All that stuff that happened with you and Sara. It's over. That's what I wanna talk to you about. She's pregnant. Oh. Wow. That's great. Thanks. We're really happy. You know, I never meant to hurt anybody. I know. Hey, I wish you the best of luck with everything. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Can you at least tell her I stopped by? Probably not. (MUFFLED BEAT MUSIC) ROMIE: I've gotta cut some of these girls. If you fire them, you gotta replace them. I'm not getting on no pole. (KNOCKING) Hey. (LAUGHING) - LENA: Thank you, John John, - Don't even worry about it. Come here. Oh, why didn't you call me? I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, honey. I felt really bad about this. Don't worry about it. You need anything from me? I just came here to thank you. You're not coming back, are you? I wish I could say I was surprised. I just need a change. I was right. But you're not off the hook. No, you have to promise that you're gonna come back and you're gonna check in with us every once and awhile, okay? Of course. All right, good. Because we're gonna miss you, so.
