It was just a few beers, a few whiskeys, a few spliffs, nothing special, no blast, enough to get me flying, you know? I passed out, but at no point, I mean, I didn't invite these guys to fuck me, you know? Later I told my bitch of a cousin what happened and she just shrugged and said, I'd been teasing them all night. You just gave them the wrong impression, she said. As if it wasn't their fault, you know? Nothing happened. You woke up and they let you go. I trusted my cousin. Michael and David, and then they were her friends. Did you tell anyone aside from your cousin? Your parents? The police? Did you talk to anyone else? You haven't met my parents. And the cops, what would they've done? You don't know what it feels like. You just sit here in your comfy chair, and you nod, and you judge people, and decide their fate. You don't know shit! It says in your case report that you attacked Mr. Allen in a car park. Do you think violence was the appropriate response? That prick violated me. He got what he deserved. And Michael, well. There's an ongoing legal case against both of them. Oh spare me that legal bullshit. What he did to me can't be undone. But you can learn strategies to deal with it, better strategies than violence. Arts and sports are ways. I found a way that works for me. But you have to channel your anger. For example archery is a good way of combining both physical and mental self-discipline. How did you get that scar? Let's focus on you, shall we? What? Archery didn't work for you? It was a long time ago. Some scars never heal. Our time is up. I've got your scent now, I'll always find you. You hear me? Hey. Hey. What, what? Calm down. Calm down. I'm going to get us out of here, but you need to calm down. Okay. Do you have anything on you to cut these ropes with? That's good, pass it over here. What the, Jamie? What the hell are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing. I haven't seen you for ages. Why are we here Jamie? What? How should I know. Hey those men, you're cool right? You and I, you won't just leave me here will you? Is this about money, Ben? Is somebody there? There's someone else in here. Help me! Hold on. Help! Ben! Ben! Jamie, Jamie, you have to follow my lead. Okay? Jamie! Right. We have to smuggle out. As Aristotle says, he who lives without snout, doesn't deserve to live. There she is. Are you okay? We're going to get you out of here. What's going on? We were trapped in the other room, move back, I'm going to break the lock. Hurry. Hurry! Hurry! This gets better and better. This gets better and better. No, no, get away from me! I'll save you. Get off me. What are you doing? Get her out. I can't. Just get her out okay? Just hurry up. Emma? Come on, we have to go. Shh. Hey! Hey! Let's go, let's go! I can't, my foot! She fell? Don't! You take her then. Come on. What's going on? What are you doing here with him? I don't know. Who are those thugs? I don't know. I'm trying to figure things out myself? But if we want to make it out of here, we have to follow him. Everything all right? All good just her foot. I can't follow him, he scares me, we shouldn't trust him. Well right now we don't have much of a choice. I'm not going to follow him. Hey, listen to me, I'll make sure he doesn't touch you, now come on. I'm not going to follow him further into the woods. What are you doing? Shit! Two that way. One that way. I thought I heard something. How's your foot? None of this makes any sense. What the hell is going on? Listen, first Ben then you, I haven't seen either of you since the trial, so you tell me what's going on. I bet he's behind this. What Ben? I don't know he got you out of there, didn't he? Well maybe that's the idea. Well what am I doing here then? There's something about these woods. We need to find thicker cover. What are you crazy? We don't know where we're going. Those creeps can. Shh. Do you hear that? No. Exactly. Come on let's go. No. I'm not. Jesus Christ. Fucking idiots. Damn fools. Jamie wait. What now? I must rest a bit. What here? We should've stayed in the bushes. We weren't safe there. But here we are right? We can hide in that cave. That's a hole in the dirt. God knows what's in there, no come on. Maybe we'll find something at the end of this gorge. I can't my foot. Just keep going a little bit further. I can't alright? Fine. No thank you. He who lives without snout doesn't deserve to live. Yes well, I don't smoke. Okay so, here's what we do, you should go and hide in that cave, I'll have a look around, okay? Well maybe you shouldn't go by yourself? No, I'll be fine, I'll come back for that. If those creeps are out there I need to know. Jamie? Jamie? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Here you go boss. So what are we gonna do with that cunt over there? I saw this Bond movie the other day, Casino Royale. And they crack James Bond's balls with a thick rope. Yeah that's that one with Max, Mix, what's his name? Guy from Manny. Wait, it's me, I won't hurt you. Yeah, yeah, Mads Mikkelsen! That's the fucker. Yeah, he put Bond on a chair, right? I say we chop off his balls. Put it on a stick, and serve it to him, huh? So he can eat it, what do you think? Put that knife down. Okay it was just a thought. So what's next? We stay put, and just follow instructions. Don't you dare touch me. I came back to save you, we've got to get out of here, okay? How did you find me? We don't have time for this. Did you set this up? What are you talking about? This all of this. For fucks sake Emma, look at me. Do I look like someone who has the funds to pull off an operation like this? Jeez, I'm one paycheck away from being a homeless person. Looks can be deceiving. We have to get out of here now. I'm not gonna follow you. Okay. Find your own way back see if I care if you get yourself killed in this bloody forest. We have to help him. Didn't you see what they did to him? I thought he was your friend. My friend? I haven't seen this guy since he put me in prison, okay? Why do you care anyhow? He's not your friend either, or is he? That doesn't mean he deserves to be tortured. Wake up Emma. Do you really think he would care if it was me or you hanging on that tree? You know what he would do? He would do the sensible thing and get the fuck out of this forest. You know for a moment you had me. I thought you changed somehow but you're still the same old devious bastard aren't you? Some scars never heal do they? Okay. But you have to do exactly as I tell you, alright? Now you look like Zorro, huh? You like that shit huh? Pig. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just a little bit more, she likes it. Thinks he's Michel bloody Angelo. As long as it keeps him occupied and you two apart. That guy's a bloody idiot. Alright I've had enough, oi, nut head! Hey! Freeze! Jamie, Jamie are you okay? We have to support him like this. Put that arm over your shoulder. And you work with us. You try walking when your legs have gone to sleep. Can you see? I don't need fucking glasses. Did they see you? You won't need that. Whatever. Get up, we got to get moving. Where are you taking us? To safety. I found some caves near the beach. They were blathering something about a rope and a chair. Just awful. There was this excruciating pain and then I guess everything went black. Did they say anything, did they say anything useful. Look I wasn't in a state to listen to their yapping. Oh you think that's funny, being tortured? Those charcoal glasses look terrible on you. You know what? Fuck you, what do you know? You know what Jamie? Just forget it. What? Listen, if you have something to say then spit it out, what is it? You were tortured, really? But yet no scratches, no wounds. What do you call this? What did you get slapped by a branch or something? Stop being a fucking pussy Jamie! You seem to be strangely familiar with what victims of torture actually look like. Yes, I am. Oh, I wonder how that is? Did you pick it up in your one semester at St.Georges? Or was it afterwards when they threw your ass in prison? Careful Jamie, or not even daddy's money gonna help you. Alright, enough. Ben, I'm sure you've got some MacGyver survival stuff you can do, right? Sure, we should leave the beach, it's not safe here. And Jamie stop your whining it was only a scratch. He's got my gun. Now I don't have a fucking gun. This was supposed to be an easy job. This was not part of the deal. You're number three now. Huh. I know this place. My parents and I used to come here. There should be a village somewhere. Do you know which way? Great. It's been over 20 years. Are you coming? We're just gonna wait here all night? Yes. Why? For fuck's sake shut it! I'm not fucking talking to you okay? Everything goes as planned. No, no, no, no. It'd be good to know what the fucking plan is. For fuck's sake, we're soldiers, we do what we're told. You sure we're safe here? This could be recent. Whoever made that fire left ages ago. What the hell is that? A map. Let's have a look. What does it say? We're in the middle of nowhere, about 20 miles from Wolf Harbor. It's impossible to cover that distance before nightfall. It's already getting dark. It's going to take us a couple of days to get out of these woods. No, no, listen up, those animals, they could turn up here any second, we have to keep moving. Keep it down. Listen it is madness to run through the forest at night. This cave is as safe as it gets. He's got a point. Has he? How come everybody is a fucking survival expert now? Tomorrow we should go inland. What are you mad? Go deeper into the forest? We have to stay by the sea Hungry, anyone? Listen. Seriously, that's probably the only thing we'll have to eat for the next day or two. Jamie I really don't want to have an argument with you. What's going on? Half the forest can hear you. It's just milady over here decided to finish the rest of the soup all by herself. And? And, I don't think it's okay for one of us to eat it all. Keep the damn soup. That wasn't so hard was it? Excuse me? Show a bit of self restraint. You know what go ahead and eat the soup. Oh I have your permission? Whatever just keep it down okay? Wait where are you going? Outside. Why? To take a piss. Well what about the soup? Are you out of your fucking mind? Problem solved. Stop staring at me, it's getting ridiculous with you. I'm sorry, I just like the way you're blowing your fag. What you want to do my boy? You really want to bring a knife to a gun fight? Ah we were just fucking around, right Frotti? One more word, he will kill you, I don't care. You scared me. About earlier, no hard feelings. He who lives without snout. Do you think anyone's looking for you? Friends, family? Mm hmm. What about you? Right, CEO of a start up, who would look for me? Can I ask you a question? Mm hmm. Do you ever think about it? You know, back then, what happened, what he did to you? No. Sometimes, I don't know. Sometimes there's a patient who has been raped. And then it's unsettling. But since you both pulled me out of that cell, none of it makes any sense. Would you ever be able to forgive him? It's been what 15 years now? He suffered for what he did. Perhaps it's time to give it a rest. What are you talking about? I'm just saying, it might get easier for you, if you just forgave him, doesn't he deserve forgiveness? I've never stopped wondering why it happened. I've never fully understood it. Not after the trial, the evidence, everything. But what if he didn't mean to do it? What did he just fall into me by accident then? Oh there's someone lying in the alley way with a broken arm, and oops my trousers just dropped. Alright I just. I've worked with survivors of abuse for awhile now, rape is never an accident, it's intentional. Why did you speak up for him in the witness box? Someone had to. He was my mate. And his sister never turned up so, she was the only family he had left. I heard she died a few years later, drugs. Ben was never the kind of guy who talked much about his feelings or emotions. Don't know why. Maybe it's his upbringing, maybe he never learned how. What I'm getting at, what if he didn't do it? What if someone set him up? Sure, it's possible but not probable. All the evidence pointed at him. Evidence can be doctored. Plus didn't the guy wear a ski mask? Look Jamie, you can't believe in conspiracies. Yes, he wore a mask, but the police found it in Ben's room and he admitted his guilt. It's never as simple as it looks. Sometimes it is. I still think we should stay on the coast and find our way from there. On the beach we're easy prey, no cover. We should make our way towards that river on the map. Well, straight into our doom it is then. Finally. We're going to rest for a bit. How did you get that scar? Up the stream I don't know why we're even discussing this. Again, on the beach we'll be sitting ducks. How long was I asleep? Oh Emma, well you're the reasonable one here eh? So could you please tell him that it makes far more sense to just follow the stream back to the beach and once we're there make our way to the village along the shore? Let me see the map. Okay, we are here. Now with the stream, we'd have water and cover. Oh right, come straight into those hobgoblins because we won't see them coming. Say something. I'm with Ben on this, going downstream makes more sense. Are you coming Jamie? How can you support this exceptionally moronic plan? To run deeper into this fucking forest? Why would you trust your rapist? I'm trusting the map, and it tells me the way along the coast is all cliff. We'd be trapped between the sea and the cliff. Surrendering ourselves to whatever attacker awaits us. I don't know if you realize this, but you are surrendering yourself to an attacker right now. Oh but hey, perhaps it isn't such a big deal for you after all then is it? Guys the sun's going down soon. What just happened there? Nothing, she's just got the hots for me. Don't worry. I've been in worse situations in my life. Who cares about the situations you've been in? Oh hey, so do you think anyone still lives there? It's a bit rundown. Looks like an old shelter for foresters. Good hideout for the night. Isn't it a bit too exposed. I don't know about you, but I don't feel like sleeping in the rain and the dirt tonight. Not a chance. It's dark as fuck in here. What about this? There's still petrol in here. Will it work? I don't know maybe. Let's try it. What and risk being heard? That's a terrific plan really. Why don't you keep looking. Perhaps you'll find a gas cooker too. Then we can all enjoy some fine dining out here, can't we. Oh that's right, we don't have anything to eat. Guys. Give me your lighter Jamie. What in the actual fuck? What the hell is this Emma? Why would you do this to me? Me Are you mad? I didn't do anything. You fucking raped me! You couldn't have possibly seen whoever it was in the ski mask could you? But you still let them put me in prison. Is that justice for you? Shut up. Hey, hey, hey. Get off me! You set this up. Give me one good reason, if anything it must've been her. To take revenge? She's smart enough for it. She always despised me. And she has a motive. Why are you here, what are you doing here? Hey calm down okay? You don't know anything you shouldn't be here. Hey! Pull yourself together okay. I'm on your side. Emma's right. Why would anyone abduct you and draw a direct link between you and a crime you say you had nothing to do with? I was the only one who stood up for you, don't forget. Yeah, and what good did it do? They still sent me to prison didn't they? Oh and you're saying I'm responsible for that? You never gave a fuck about anyone but yourself Jamie. You just fucked everybody over didn't you? But it ends now. Emma. How does it feel to be in control like this? Gives you a hard on doesn't it? Don't make me do this. Okay? I know you won't, you could never face the consequences of your actions could you? Don't you ever point that gun at me again. Really stop the biz. Are you blind? Drop it. Just do it. Thoms, get out of there. Thoms! Just drop the fucking gun. Get out! Jamie, we have to go back, we have to look for Emma. What? No, screw her. You want to feed her to the dogs? I want to get out of this damn forest. Those guys are killers Jamie. How do you know that? I spent three years in the Foreign Legion, I've met people like that, she's in real danger, okay? Well, all the more reason not to run after them. What the fuck is wrong with you? What kind of person are you? Look Jamie, she came back for you, you owe her that, we both do! No I don't. For all I know she's the reason I'm in this mess in the first place. You know what? Do what the fuck you want to do. I don't want to leave her behind. Fucking hell! Got ya! Footprints leading into the forest. There you go love. It's more comfortable this way. You like tea? Do you eat meat? Vegetarian, vegan? No, I know she likes meat, right? Fuck it. I don't understand why we're doing this. That is exactly why you're not leading this operation. Now move back to your tree and shut up. So I suppose this is all part of your training then yeah? Finding tracks. Making fires. Ambushing people, kicking the shit out of them. It was that the party in Soho when you told me the Aristotle quote. Remember that? It was a good one. I liked it. It's always gone down well with the ladies. Moliere. Huh? That quote, it wasn't Aristotle. You know you might never find her? I don't know why you feel you owe her something? You don't. So let's just do the right thing, get out of here. Go to the police. If getting me out of here is a question of money, you know I'm good for it. What will you pay me to leave her behind? Back in the day it worked out alright for you didn't it? In the German primary school, the teacher explains to the children the history of concentration camps of the second World War. Little Klaus holds up his hand and says, My grandfather died in such a camp. The teacher replies, I'm so, so, so, so sorry. Little Klaus says yes He was so drunk and fell out of the watchtower. You don't like this joke? Is is joke from the Legion. What Legion? The Foreign Legion, where real men come from! If you want I can show you. Don't worry about him love. I've got a good one, and you'll like this one too. So that fluffy bunny rabbit we came across on the path back there, now, not many people know that fluffy bunny rabbits have a very important function in the Legion, every troop carries a sackful of them. When men are in the field in woods like this, it's very hard to find a good fuck. People like our friend Piggy over here, need a little bit of relief. So we take one of the fluffy bunny rabbits out of the bag and we jam its head in a drawer. And then we get the soldier to fuck that rabbit right up its ass, just as the Legionnaire's about to cum we slam that drawer shut and that fluffy bunny rabbit's ass pumps like a fucking cunt. Why are you doing this to us? This is not part of the deal. What deal. Who did you have a deal with? Mademoiselle I've been doing this for quite a while now, but I must admit, this is one of the more exotic jobs. Come mate let's pack up. Please mademoiselle you must get up now. You want my hand? Make no words like in a movie. You turn around close your eyes and count to 100. If everything goes according to plan. Please. Louder. One, two, three, four, five, six. Don't peek because I can see it huh? If you're cheating, is that what you're going for? I will see you around little bunny. Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54. Emma! What happened? Where are those nut jobs? They're gone. They they were telling jokes about the Foreign Legion. About a job they were hired to do. Do you have a cigarette? Now hang on a minute. What did they say about the Foreign Legion? They were soldiers, legionnaires. We need to look for cover. You were in the Foreign Legion weren't you? Yes. So that's it. You orchestrated this, all of this. It was you, what kind of sick mind game are you playing here? Certainly not my fault, and certainly not hers that you screwed up your life. For fuck's sake Jamie, cut it out. You never gave a rats ass about anyone but yourself. Oh didn't I? Didn't I take care of things? Didn't I give you the money you needed after you raped her? Let him go Ben! Keep your hands where I can see them. He's right, it's all you. It all makes sense. You don't really believe that little cock sucking bastard do you? They said, they were ex legionnaires, just like you. They had orders! It's all about revenge, isn't it? Revenge for your time in prison! Just admit it! I don't have reason to take revenge. You don't see the whole picture here. I never touched you 15 years ago. He did. He's lying. He raped you and then his father gave me a lot of money to take the blame for it. Don't listen to him Emma. What about the evidence? What about the evidence? His father made sure the evidence pointed away from him. Away from the family. Shut up your Lang up you fucking traitor! Stop! Jamie? You think I'd let you ruin my life? This gets better and better. You think you can destroy me, huh? You think you can take me down? Go to hell! Who do you think you are huh? How did you get that scar? Let's focus on you shall we? Some scars never heal. No matter what I say follow the plan. I'll lead them here. Get in the cage. Slut. Shut up! Rise and shine sleepy head. Took you a little while. Now get up. Take this and finish it. Emma, you don't need to do this. Shut your lying mouth, you misogynistic prick! How dare you even talk to me? Have you ever been raped? Pull down your pants. Are you serious. Don't I look serious to you? You want some money. Shut your fucking face and pull down your fucking jeans. Still feeling lucky prick? Thought so. Now think about something nice and pull down your jeans. Tell me. Did anyone ever shoved a screwdriver up your ass? No? Lucky you. Then look at it as a unique new experience. And who knows perhaps you'll enjoy it, hmm? Why are you doing this? Because I want to, come on, lose the boxers. You've got to stop, you can't do this. No you can't. I don't want this. Yes you do, you're just to shy to ask. I never wanted anyone to be tortured. What have you done? You see technically I am you, so all of this is you. Ben. Ben, I'm so sorry. Emma. Listen, Jamie. Don't talk now. Sorry, I needed the money. Everything will be alright, it will be okay. Alright, here we go. I was raped but I'm okay now. What happened doesn't matter. All that matters is that it was wrong and impossible to undo. I wanted him to pay for what he did to me. But I couldn't do it, so she took over. Did what she said was necessary. But I realized something, I understood that she wouldn't make me whole again. I realized that I didn't want to be like her. Violent, vengeful, cynical, full of hate. That night I decided that I wouldn't let her corrupt me anymore. I wouldn't let him win either. Instead I chose the future because it was mine.
