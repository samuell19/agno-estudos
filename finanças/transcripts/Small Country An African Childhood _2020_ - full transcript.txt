BURUNDI IS A COUNTRY IN CENTRAL AFRICA, BORDERED BY RWANDA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, AND TANZANIA. ITS CAPITAL CITY IS BUJUMBURA. IN 1992, WHEN THIS STORY BEGINS, ITS POPULATION WAS 5.6 MILLION. AS IN RWANDA, THERE WERE TWO MAJOR ETHNIC GROUPS: THE HUTU MAJORITY, AND THE TUTSI. SMALL COUNTRY BUJUMBURA, BURUNDI Hey, you little pests! Get out of my garden! Go away! Quick, darling, release the dogs! Now I'll show you! How dare you! Mangoes, mangoes, mangoes, mangoes! Madam, don't you want a mango? Mango, monsieur? Mangoes! Mangoes! Boy, get out of here! Monsieur, mango! - Mango? - Ah... Gabriel! Where did you find these wonderful mangoes? We picked them. - You picked them? - Yes. Okay... I'll take one. How much does it cost? - 200 francs. - 200 francs? Are they made of pure gold? 200 francs for a mango? Gaby, you're amazing! - The teacher must have been shocked. - It will be a lesson to her. - Hello, boss. - Hello, Calixte. Hello, hello. - Hello, Prothé. - Hello, Gaby. - How are you? - Good, and you? - Normal. - What do you want me to make for you? - Crepes, please. - Crepes... I will make them right away. - Prothé, you're not sick anymore? - No, I'm not sick anymore. - I feel much better. And how are you? - Okay. What do you want me to make for you? - Crepes. - Okay. - How's school going? - Normal. - Our teacher is very good. - Really? I like mathematics, but it's hard. It's nothing, learn more and you will manage. - How are things here? - Father. - Did you sleep well? And you? - Normal. - Prothé, your condition seems to have improved. - Yes, much better. My family thanks you. Do not thank me. They will deduct it from your salary. Yes, hello? Are you kidding me? So... if they pay me by Friday, the work will be done. So give it to them. Calixte, feed the dog and leave the gate open. - Okay, boss. - Okay, kids. It's time to go! Hello, darlings. Did you hear what Dad said? Come on, hurry up, please. Come on. - Salam aleikum, Donatien. - Hello, Calixte. That's how I got this job. We don't have to choose a lot, right? Give me your credentials. Give them here. Donatien, borrow it. Hello. Hello, boss. Here come the reinforcements. Let's go! - We have to go through the construction site. - Again? But, Dad, I'm always late for school when we stop there! Don't worry. Gaby! Ana, wait, your bag! I gotta run! Six, seven... eight... and nine. I see you, Gabriel Shapaz. Sorry, my dad had to stop at the construction site. You always have the same excuse. As I was saying... - "The Bus Gang"! That's good. - But they won't understand. "NW Gang" is better. It will sound great in English. Also, "the Volkswagen Gang". Not bad. - This is also an option. - Chloe, thank you, sit down. You must have something interesting. Gabriel, get up. Gino, the note. Give it to me! "The three musketeers, eternal friends. Together forever..." "The Bus Gang", "Gang NW". True poetry. Gino, get up. Armand, Lucien and Paul, too. It's actually a gang of five. Five donkeys, madam! Gabriel, why isn't "The Three Musketeers" suitable as a name for your gang? Don't you know? You roar like a donkey. You don't know? Does anybody know? There are five of them, but there were four musketeers. Correct. Well done, Felicite. The gang of five, you stay. And you will repeat the poem. The others can go out. - Hello, children. - Hello, Mom. - How was your day? - Alright. - What about you? Alright? - Yes. - Will you have dinner? - I ate already. With Gertrude? - Prothé, will you cut me a lemon? - Right away. Hello, Gertrude. - I didn't tell you, but... - Are you done, monsieur? After clearing the table, you can go home. - Will you drink coffee? - We went to the club. No! - "Black and White", and you? - Mom? - Mom? - What? - Will you eat dessert with us? - Yes, yes, I'm coming, dear. Really? Why? Stop it. Yes, yes... How much to offer to meet him? I don't know how much. - Go take a shower and go to bed. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Wait, wait. I have to kiss the children goodnight. - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight, my dear. - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight. - Don't forget to pray. - Of course. BUKAVU, ZAIRE He lived in Africa a long time ago. Do you see the two elephants there? They were engraved by a magician. Wizard! Can you imagine? - How are you, Evariste? - I'm well, ma'am, thank God. God has nothing to do with it. Everything works in this country only thanks to whites. - When I say "God", I mean you, boss! - Stop blathering on and clean up here! And bring three beers! Crowds of poor idlers in Bukava kneel for alms. This country is going to hell. Come to Bujumbura and settle down with me. I'm about to sign two very profitable construction projects. No, Burundi is not for me. I'm more Zairean than the blacks. - There are only problems with the Burundians. - I'm tired of it here, too. Jacques, she's just dreaming of moving to Paris. I can barely stand it. Let's get out of that hole. Why "a hole"? Don't you like your house? Don't you have enough space? Not enough servants... or enough sun? - I didn't want to live in Bujumbura. - But this is your home! No, no, no, Michel. My home is Rwanda, on the other side. - And you know what I am to the Burundians. - Yes, a refugee. - Yes, refugee, what's so funny? - That's all you keep saying. True, because here, I will always be a refugee. What will you be in France? There will be no one! At least my children will grow up safe. You are a French citizen. How many Africans would change places with you? Leave that racism for colonizers like Jacques. It doesn't suit old hippies like you. Okay. Where is the beer? Get your hands off! I'm sick of it. - As long as you're angry. - You don't think what you're saying. Yes, yes, go on behaving like that. Don't you dare touch me! I'm tired! How much longer do I have to endure? Will you ever stop this hysteria? - Is it hysteria? So I'm hysterical? - Gaby, I peed. - Go and tell Mom. - No! Quiet. What are you talking about, Yvonne? What other woman? Do you think I'm blind? Do you think I'm an idiot? The phone rang ten times and ten times they hung up. - You gave her our home number! - What? Can't I give our number to anyone? I have too many problems to deal with your fantasies on top of them. My fantasies? You have a mistress, and I should shut up? I shouldn't have given birth to your children! - Children?! You're talking about children? - You wanted them, did you forget? Don't you dare talk to me like that! - You have responsibilities as a father! - How much more can you scream? You do nothing but scream, scream, scream! - Aren't you tired? - I won't get tired! Don't listen to the gossip in Bujumbura! - They saw you with her! - Who did they see me with? - I work with a lot of people. - They saw you with her! I'm tired of you! And you know what? - I stopped being ashamed a long time ago! - Go away! Disappear! Go to your whore from the embassy, while I look after your children! Get out! Go to bed. Stop crying, or I'll slap you. - Go to bed. - Calixte? - I was joking! - Calixte, my cigarettes! Does your nose bother you a lot? Are you scared? Maybe it stretches like a trunk? He's small, like a dwarf! I was expecting ridicule, even death. My nose is small... - You're a liar! - God, my nose is huge! Bastard! That's enough! Gino! Pascal! Stop now! Are you crazy?! What is going on here? Gino? - Nothing, madam. - What do you mean, nothing? You won't tell me? What happened, Pascal? Tell me now. Okay, to the principal's office. Come on! Felicite, you'll lead the class. Gino, stop it! What happened? Pascal said the Tutsis have noses like Cyrano. And Gino replied that at least they didn't have shit for brains like the Hutus. And Pascal said your mother has an ugly nose like Depardieu. I will not let this idiot Pascal insult my mother. I'll teach this ugly Hutu to respect us! But you are half white. - My mother is Tutsi! - Your father is Belgian! And according to tradition, you are Tutsi only if your father is Tutsi. You know nothing about this country. Anywhere you look, it's only us and the Hutus! - You're just talking nonsense. - To live here, you have to choose a side. And if I don't, what will you do? Will you split the class in two? One side for the Tutsis, and the other for the Hutus? Nonsense! - Why are we arguing about nonsense? - This is not nonsense! This is important! When you are a Tutsi, you are a Tutsi. Your mother and I have decided to live separately for a while... But if you want, Ana, you can live with her. - No, I want to stay with Gaby. - Alright, stay with Gaby. Will Mom come back? Of course. She will take you on Sundays, and you will visit your grandmother. What about Christmas? No. On Christmas, Mom will travel to her family in Rwanda. The three of us will celebrate Christmas. You're sad because Mom won't be with us at Christmas? We'll celebrate another Christmas with her, okay? Ana, back off! - I'm first! - Let me go, let me go! Let me go! Wow, a BMX bike! - Come on! - A princess dress! Everyone freeze! Dad! Wake up! Look what Santa brought me! Look! - Who are you? But this is my daughter! - What a dress! I'll eat you now. I'm going to eat you whole! And who is this? Hey, Gino! What a beauty, a BMX bike! - Will you give me a ride? - Yes, come on. - How was your Christmas? - Mom flew in from Paris. She got three days off from the UN. - Look what she bought me. - What a beautiful watch! Can I try your bike? No, stop! Yes, he said it right. If you say that, mom will be happy and proud of you. Thanks. Remember everything, huh? Now you put it on the plate... - Mom? - Yes? Ah, you little parrot! What is this? - Did you learn it, Pacifique? - I think we need to learn Kinyarwanda. - Mom, tell her I'm right. - You know what he said? "I'm a little white fool!" Don't listen to your uncle. - Go for a beer. - Let's go, Gaby. - He must know our language. Kinyarwanda. - You say the same thing every Sunday. - You sound like a broken record. - Yvonne, your son is Rwandan, whether you like it or not. And one day, he will regret that he knows nothing about his country. Always the same, Mom. Pacifique, did you drop out of school? The other students have already gone to the front. And I'm leaving soon. You're just going to keep quiet? It wasn't enough that Alphonse died there? - He knows what he needs to do. - What does he know? He's never been to Rwanda! Everyone has the right to fight for his homeland. No one should be a refugee all his life. You naively think that Rwanda is paradise on earth. Habyarimana wants to destroy all the Tutsis in the country. - Is this what you want? - Mom hasn't been there in 30 years. And when the opportunity arises to go home, you want to go to war. - We need to regain power. - What power? - There is an offer to share power. - You're a coward. - And you're a real fool! - Yvonne, Pacifique! Stop it, both of you! Shut up, that's enough! I'm tired of it! Don't you need a mattress? No. That's how I train. For the war? Yes. GOD IS ALMIGHTY Do you believe in God, Pacifique? No, I'm a communist. I believe in the people. I don't believe in God, either. In Burundi, the election campaign is in full swing. The Burundians will choose a new president and a new Council of Ministers. - Why are you here? Where is Calixte? - Calixte is gone. - What do you mean? - He left early in the morning. - He will not return. - Move. What did he do? - He stole a lot of things. - Like what? A wheelbarrow, welding equipment, sheers. And many other things. I'll deal with this on Monday. - Dad, Calixte stole Gaby's bike! - He won't stop crying. Prothé told me about your bike. We will get it back to you. One of the candidates for the presidency of Burundi is Melchior Ndadaye, the main rival of the incumbent president. Ndadaye is the leader of FRODEBU in Burundi, and is a Hutu. President Buyoya is a Tutsi. Ndadaye has been criticized and accused of building his campaign on an ethnic platform... - Where are you from? - Do you see that house? The one on the left. Go and ask about Léonce's mother. - Will you come? - I don't want to get my shoes dirty. I will be waiting for you here. See how many Hutus there are around. Do not touch the car! Get out of the car! - Can I get on? - No. - Are you Léonce's mother? - Yes, I'm his mother. - Good day. - Good day to you, too. So you know where his bike is. Yes, I know, yes. I will call someone to take you. Godfrey, Balthasar! Come here, quickly! What? Come here. We need your help. Show them the way to Mathias. They came for the bike. Mathias? They came for the bike which he bought. I have already sold it to Jean Bosco. - Where does he live? - On the way to the avocado grove. - You can't miss it. - I know where it is. Come with me. Matthias said that the child's bicycle is with you. I bought it, but it is no longer with me. I sold it to a farmer in Gitaba. Let's go. Why do you have 50 people in the car? Tell them to get off. - We are looking for the child's bike. - Let us pass. Get down, fast. Boss, I need this boy. All right. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. What do you want? We came to get the bike. - What bike? - The one stolen from us. My bike! I bought it for my son! - I bought it! This is our bike! - It's not yours! It was stolen from my boss. You hear me? It's stolen. Are you listening to me? I bought it! - Boscu sold you a stolen bicycle. - I bought it from Jean Bosco! - Calixte stole it from the boss. - I paid for it! - Enough, I'm taking it. - You can't! - Move away. - It can't be that way. I spent all my money. I know nothing about that, they stole it from us. I bought it! I didn't steal it! Who are you really? - Give me the bike! - Move away! Everybody pull away. Gaby! This is worse than theft. You're defending these peasants? Even a fool could see that they're lying. All Hutus are liars and should not be trusted! - You can't take it! - It's over, we're done, back off. What are you doing? How can that be? I will not touch this bike again, I swear. - You told me, but... - You're always kidding. - Mom, can I go swimming? - I said, at three in the afternoon. If you are bored, get some sleep with the others. Does anyone know what the gift was? - We know what the gift was. - And what was it? ♪ We will win this election, there is no doubt! ♪ ♪ Get up, citizen! ♪ ♪ Vote for the FRODEBU! ♪ He needs to look the truth in the eyes. He got married to be a good African, and got married to go shopping on the Champs-Élysées. Time has passed since my mom used to tell me what to do in bed with a boy. You're absolutely right, Yvonne. In his eyes, the children are half black. To me, they are half white. Parents may not see their children as the same color. - Will the judge understand that? I don't know. - I don't know. Gaby, what did I say? I told you to go play. Gaby! Get out of there now, scumbag! You jumped into the pool in front of my friends! What will they think of me now? - Why did you do this? - Don't answer! Disgracing me in front of everyone, fool! It's not fair! - You don't even know why Gaby jumped in! - Well, tell me why. Because you were saying nasty things about Dad in front of those fat women. I wish everyone a happy 1993. - Thanks. - Sit down. Well... You all know that this year, for the first time, the Burundians will choose the next President of the Republic themselves, in a free and democratic election. This is a very important event for the country. Can anyone explain to us what democracy is? It's like in France, teacher. Yes, but what makes France a democracy? - Madam? - Yes, Gino? Because before that, the kings did whatever they wanted, and that's why they killed them. Thank you, Gino. Take out your social sciences notebooks... - Oh, we're writing again! - ...and write down: "Democracy is a system of government, "in which power is in the hands of the people, "not one man." JUNE 1, 1993 Your documents. Give it to me! Pass! - Gaby, catch the ball. - I'll catch up with you! Hey, boy, come here. - Will you help the blind gentleman? - Yes. You can accompany me to the polls. Take the ballot. Okay, accompany him. - How old are you? - Twelve. - Can you read? - Yes. Today is a historic day, boy! Truly historic! Read what it says here. "Pierre-Calva Sandgia, the People's Reconciliation Party. (PRP)" "Melchior Ndadaye, Front for Democracy in Burundi. (FRODEBU)" "Pierre Buyoya, Union for National Progress (UPRONA)." - Who are you for? Okay. - Melchior Ndadaye, FRODEBU! FRODEBU! FRODEBU! - Are you done? - Yes, yes, I'm done. - You're not confused about something? - No, no. Excellent. Thank you. There haven't been free elections in Burundi since the independence of the state, but today, the people have come to vote en masse. We're happy to announce that no incidents have been reported. At the end of the day, tensions have dissipated even in the Bujumbura region, the center of the opposition, where the situation is most complex. Dad is hanging on the phone all day. - There are rumors spreading at the embassies. - Rumors of what? - That FRODEBU has won the election. - Are you satisfied? You made the old man happy, and you marked as he wanted. If FRODEBU won the majority of votes, Ndadaye will be president. - All elections end like this. - Gaby, are you pretending, or do you really not understand? If the Hutus come to power, they will expel all Tutsis from the country. There will be chaos here that you can't imagine. - FRODEBU's Ndadaye has 61% of the vote. - Gaby, shall we play before bed? The Union for National Progress, the ruling party, shrouds itself in worrying silence... and acknowledges defeat. What does it matter who wins, if the army is behind the Union party? I'll tell you what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid that if FRODEBU presses them, they may decide to take revenge. Dad, will you stay with us? Yes, darling, I will stay with you tonight. Give me a kiss. Dad, I don't understand the difference between Hutus and Tutsis. - Very simple. They have different noses. - I'm being serious. Hutus are short with wide noses, and Tutsis are tall and thin, with narrow noses, like mom. And they're very secretive. You're Tutsi, and I never know what's going through your mind. - Dad, what am I? - You're a naughty girl! And you're going to bed right now! The Hutu and the Tutsi are fighting because they want the same territory? They have the same country, the same language and the same religion. - Then why the fighting? - It's a nose war. - Enough... - And our Prothé is a Hutu. Well done! Madam knows everything! And now go to bed... and turn off the light! - Will the new president fix things? - Come on, turn it off, Gaby. - Will he take revenge on the Tutsis? - No one will take revenge on anyone. Will mom be okay? Of course, don't worry. Turn it off now. Good night. Pass it, pass it! - Give it to me! - Who are you passing it to? Pass faster! - Francis, give us the ball back! - Give us the ball! Hey! - Francis, give us the ball! - Stop it already! Hey, Francis! Don't tell me what to do. This is a public beach. It's my friend's birthday. Stop it! You want the ball? Come get it! Come on! You want it so much? Come get it! - Dad! - Yes? We were playing, but Francis stole the ball from us and now Gino and Francis are fighting! Come and get it! Come on, Gino! Show him! Damn it, Gino! Come on, Gino! Show him! What's going on here? Hey, back off! Get away from each other! Let him go! Let him go! Let him go, damn it! Stop it! - Let me go! - What are you? None of your business. Let me go, you white bastard! - What did you say? - Fuck you! Get out of here! - You will pay for it, freaks! - Get lost! Gaby, Mom's coming. What? It's your turn! Mom! My darlings. Everything's fine, my darlings. - Will you stay with us? - I came to celebrate your brother's birthday. - How are you? - Good. Are you having fun here? I'm so glad to see you. Look at Gaby! Take the box. Jacques, give me your lighter, please. ♪ Happy birthday, dear Gaby! ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to you! ♪ - Gaby, blow out the candles! - Make a wish. Come on, blow them out! This is from Mom and me. We are proud of you, Gaby, in honor of your promotion to sixth grade. A video camera! Thanks, Mom. - You like it? - Thank you, Dad. Come on, there's no one. Come on, air's clear. Just be quiet. - Three in one go. - Go on! - Take that off. Do you see it? - There, there, there. Thieves! Run! They're stealing our mangoes! Hold them, hold them! Little thieves! Steal from my garden, huh?! From my garden! Here you are! It's for your birthday! Ah, you little shitheads! Your mothers are whores for the whites! Shut up, bastard! Don't talk about my mother! I'll talk about whoever I want. - Where is she now? - Fuck you! Where is she, you piece of shit? - Enough! - Where is she? Let him go! Francis, enough! Let him go! Where is she? We never see her in the neighborhood. She's dead! Leave me alone! Go back, go back. Pacifique! Pacifique! Where are you going? On the free multi-party elections in Burundi... - Hello, boss. - Hello. Yes, I hear you well. Gaby, make me some coffee. FRODEBU won in the villages. Were you able to talk to Maxim? Okay, I'm waiting. - Did you know that Prothé didn't come today? - He'll be back. Marcel! Marcel! - Don't forget to feed the dog. - Of course, boss. Yes-- Gaby, don't leave the neighborhood today. I'm listening. What's going on? - Why is he here? - Francis is in our gang now, too. That's very interesting. You didn't think to ask me? You're really dumb. Wait! He is a Tutsi. It's not what you think. He almost drowned you. He's a complete freak. He's already apologized for that. Gaby, I swear he's fine. Stop it! He lost his mother, too. - You change after a thing like that. - Why didn't you tell me? We are brothers in blood and I love you most of all. Let's go. OCTOBER 21, 1993 Marcel! Gaby! Gaby! - And the dog? And the dog? - Come in. Come on, get in! Lie down. What's up, Gaby? I don't know. Lie down. Daddy will be back soon. - Gaby, should we call Mom? - No, Gertrude. She must be at home. - Dad, where have you been all night? - Dad, what's going on? Quiet, I'm home now. Everything is fine. There were shots last night! - And a helicopter flew over the house. - Don't be afraid. I'm here, I'm here, everything's fine. Calm down. Everything's fine. Listen... Gaby, take your mattress and put it in the hallway. Ana, get your bedding and collect your toys. Come on, collect your toys. Come on, come on. Ana, don't stop. What happened? Yes? Yes? If the paratroopers abandoned Ndadaye, they won't find him alive. And the police did not respond? - It's Gino. - This is revenge for the president. Did you hear? Daddy came home and said to take the mattresses out into the hallway. A military coup was carried out. They killed the new president. - Are you serious? - I am. A Canadian journalist told my father. - Government officials have also been killed. - No way! In response, the Hutus began slaughtering Tutsis in the provinces. - Everything is in chaos. - Dad hung up the phone. I'll let you talk to them. Take it, kids, it's mom. - Hello? - Ana, darling! How are you? How is Gabriel? - Everything is fine. - Were you scared? Yes. We were scared, because we were alone without you and without Dad. Dad won't leave you anymore. We're starting the news with the military coup in Burundi. Commanders of the coup established a Public Safety Committee and declared a state of emergency. The state borders have been closed and a curfew was imposed. Melchior Ndadaye was ousted from power yesterday morning. His fate is unknown. Radio Rwanda reports that the president and some of his associates were killed. - Who's there? - Donatien. - Are you okay? - By the grace of God. - They still shooting? - The army is here. Soldiers on every corner. - Searching houses and setting fire to them. - But where is your family? I don't have the strength to speak. They killed all my hope. - Prothé! - Hello. - What should I prepare for you today? - Scrambled eggs. And you? What do you want, Ana? - Crepes. - Crepes it is. Do you know what time it is? I think the school is open today. Let's go. Go ahead! Hurry! Gather your things! Let's go. - Hello, boss. How are you doing? - Hello, Innocent. I'll answer and go. - Innocent, hello! How are you? - I'm fine, my friend. My God, what is this? Are you still here? - What? - What are you doing here? - Do you mind? - Of course, damn it. - Calm down! - I thought you were killed! Close your mouth, or you will regret your words! Wait, I'll call you again. Hey, stop it! - Enough! - Let me beat him! Let him go! Innocent! Stop right now! Let him go! Let him go! Go to the office to get your salary. Yes, Boss. Yes. Don't fall behind! WELCOME TO RWANDA Gabriel, Ana! How you've grown. How are you, Christian? Is everything alright? Yvonne, I'm so glad you came for the wedding. - Let's go. - How you've grown. KIGALI AIRPORT, RWANDA We'll sing louder than everyone! - One more time. - We'll sing louder than everyone! Maradona... Maradona moves to the defense... The ball is in. What's this? Roger Mila wants to stop him, but Maradona breaks through! It's over, girls. This is it. - Time for bed. - No! Christian, I told you not to play ball at home. Move! I will not move from this bed. - Hello. - Oh, the big sister! Thanks for coming quickly. I'm sorry for the urgency, but I couldn't wait until the wedding. - Pacifique! - Who is this sturdy guy? A real warrior. - Look at how you've grown. - Let's go, let's go. Tell me everything. - Pacifique, your coat. - Oh, yes, I forgot. So... Jean's family maintains a devout tradition. We have to get married because she is expecting a baby. - A baby? - You're having a baby? - Eusébie, didn't you tell them? - This is great news. - You'll have a cousin. - Thank you, sister! You will become a father, and you are a cousin. Didn't you change your mind? - No, I'm sure. - You don't have to be so reckless. Remember Alfonso. Think of Mom. As soon as he starts firing, everyone will return home. - The UN, Belgium, France, Canada... - They have a duty to help us. Take the children to Yusebi, Jeanne and the baby to Burundi. - They will be safer in Burundi. - Is it safe? There is a war going on. It will be even worse here. Jeanne and the children can come when they want. You're exaggerating. We intercepted their negotiations. Hutu extremists will not hand over power. They will eliminate all opposition leaders, and then they will destroy the Tutsis. - They'll kill us all! - You just want to scare me. You know nothing You don't know what I'm talking about. - Trust me. - Pacifique, you need to leave. See you tomorrow at the wedding. - Be careful on the road, Eusébie. - Of course. - Where are you going? - To Gitarama... - Your documents. - ...for his brother's wedding. Get out of the car. Your documents. Hello, Madame French. Not many French women with a nose like yours. - Get out, vermin! - But my documents are valid. I need to search you. Your Tutsi brothers are everywhere. Put your hands on the hood. You are free to go! Madame French! The documents. You're lucky that the French are our friends. - Hello. - What beauties. - Hi, Gaby. - Ana, hello. - Gaby, meet Jeanne. - Hello. - Hello. - Meet Jeanne's mother, too. My sister with her children. This is Ana, and this is Gabriel. - Little Ana. - Hello, sweetheart. My daughter-in-law is beautiful. Just beautiful. What dress do you have? You won't take my pants off. What a creep. I am a beautiful princess. Here you go. Thank you all for coming. It is a great honor for us. THREE MONTHS LATER APRIL 7, 1994 - Mom. - Son. - Mom! - It's all right, darling. Everything is fine, Mom is with you. Everything is fine. Last night, the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda. They were returning from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where there was a meeting dedicated to stabilization of the situation in the region. The plane appears to have been shot down with a rocket or projectile, in an attack planned in advance. Phone connections between the countries has been patchy. - Take the eggs. - In Bujumbura, it is fairly quiet. - What happened? - Have you heard the news? The Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed yesterday. Their plane was shot down last night. Pacifique and Jean don't answer. Neither does Eusébie. That's why I'm here. I don't know what to do. I called ten times and I only ever hear your stupid music on hold which calls on me to be patient. Yes, I'm sorry, madam. I will calm down. Can I talk with anyone? Yes, please. Calm down! Ana! Ana, come here. - Embassy of France in Kigali. Hello. - Yes, hello, madam. This is Michel Chappaz. I'm French. My family is in Kigali and needs to return to France. I'd like to know what measures to take to get them out of here. I know about the rumors that are spreading, - but you have nothing to worry about. - I'm-- I'm not worried, but I want... my family to stay at the embassy while I organize the trip. - I'll tell you their names-- - We're not registering names yet, but if the situation worsens, France will organize the departure of its citizens. Everything will be fine. - Have a nice day, sir. - Wait! Damn it. Ana, darling, stop it. Ana, enough, calm down. - Any success? - Eusébie still doesn't answer. Ana, move the ashtray. Careful, it's hot. Pass me your plate. Here you go. - Is it enough? Or do you want more? - No, that's enough. Eat. Hello? - Yvonne, it's me. - Thank God! Finally! I've been calling you all day. Yes, I hear you. I'm calling from the neighbors' phone. The phone in the house is disconnected. - Listen, we-- - Everything is very bad here. We called the French Embassy in Kigali and we asked if you could go there. We're now waiting for an answer. We won't make it to the embassy. All roads are blocked. The military and the presidential guard are killing all the Tutsis. They killed an entire family next door, can you imagine? - Can you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. Can you get to the Church of the Holy Family? Yvonne, what church? Do you know what's going on here? The radio claims that the Tutsis killed the president. They want to kill us all. - Pacifique was right, they hate us. - Eusébie, w-wait. - They won't stop until they kill us. - Eusébie, trust Pacifique. He'll come for you. - Don't despair, darling. - Yvonne, I don't know what to do-- - Hello, Prothé! - Hello, Gabriel. - You know, Mom's sleeping here. - You must be very happy. Yes, but she is sad. Eusébie called from Rwanda. Should we go straight to school, or breakfast first? - Breakfast! - Okay, but first, landing. Sit down, eat! How are you, Prothé? You managed to get this far. - Better to work and not see the military. - Of course. Dad, will Mom stay with us now? - Yes, it will stay for now. - Hooray! - Mom is staying with us! - Get off there. - Sit down, both of you. - Mom is staying with us! Ana, Ana, get down. Ana, eat like a normal person. Good evening. The situation in Rwanda continues to deteriorate. According to the International Red Cross, thousands of people have already been killed in violent incidents that erupted two days ago. Belgium and France are planning to evacuate their citizens, who are mostly located in the capital Kigali. In the last month, the city of Kigali has been completely besieged. House-to-house searches are being conducted by the military, who are killing all residents suspected of hostile intentions. These people are being executed, together with their whole family. How many people have been killed in Rwanda? Nobody knows for sure. In six weeks, a huge number of people have died, and every day there are more and more victims. Due to indifference of the international community, what is happening before our eyes is genocide. Everything will be fine. Calm down. Hello? Hello? Ah, Pacifique. Pacifique! Have you heard anything about Eusébie? We know nothing here. You're sure we can really travel to Rwanda? I'm going to tell Mom. Yes, yes. Pacifique. Pacifique is alive. His army will save Eusébie. END OF THE TUTSI GENOCIDE IN RWANDA, JULY 1994 Authorities in Rwanda have begun the initiative to encourage the return of refugees. Some of their representatives can take part in discussions in the government committee. After the conquest of Kigali by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, dozens of Tutsi families return to the capital of Rwanda. Few of them know what awaits them in this divided country, but hope to find their relatives alive. Patrick Verdier for the International French Radio, Bujumbura. Goodbye, Grandma. Take care, Yvonne. - Take care of the children. - Goodbye, Grandma. - Goodbye, Michel. - Goodbye, Mariana. I'll be back soon, do you hear? Goodbye, darlings. Gaby, take care of your sister. Wow, pretty cramped, huh? - Like this. - Nothing, nothing. Wide-open heart. Goodbye. We're leaving. Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye, goodbye. I love you. Gabriel, is everything okay? Let's go. Get in the car. - Do you want juice? - Yes. Do you feel better? - Hello, Nadine. - Hello. - How are you? - Normal. This is Gabriel. Go and sit on the terrace. I'll pour it for you now. - Have you read all these books? - Yes. Some of them several times. Thanks to them I have had many adventures. I also brought you biscuits. Ah, he woke up! Let me show you something. Here, see. Oh, an owl! - Where did you find him? - In the garden, this morning. I put him here to calm him down. Are you feeding him? I tried to give him some meat, but he is not ready to eat anything. The meat should be mixed with insects. Without them, it is not tasty. Look, I got it. It's time for lunch, little one. He's eating. It worked! You know a lot about birds. My dad taught me. I want to give you a book. What is it about? You'll find out yourself. "Jack London. White Fang" - Hello? - Honey, is that you? - It's your grandmother calling. - Hello, Grandma! How are you, darling? I'm fine. Is Mom with you? It was a quiet night in the city, but ten people were killed in an exchange of gunfire in northern Bujumbura in clashes between Hutu and Tutsi militias. - Where are you going? - I'm going to Ngagara. - This Frenchman wants to pass. - The city is blocked, turn around. - It's very important to me, boss. - You'll have to pay him. I will let you pass, but for a fee. You are not in Europe now. You think you can go wherever you want? Excellent. Come on, come on. Close your eyes. I told Yvonne... to close her eyes... and not to look. There were bodies everywhere. Everywhere. Hundreds of corpses. Dead, dead... dead everywhere. We stopped... and we watched. We walked like... in a nightmare, until we arrived at Aunt Eusébie's house in Kigali. Then Yvonne entered the house. She found your cousins... in the living room, and Christian in the hallway. Aunt Eusébie was nowhere to be found. We searched for her all over the neighborhood but none of the neighbors knew where she was. Yvonne... decided to stay in the house in case she returned. Gaby, you can go to your sister if you want. No. Where is Yvonne now? I don't know. I don't know where she went. I went to the Pacifique. Jeanne and her whole family were killed. Everyone. Pacifique found their killers and avenged their deaths. He emptied his entire cartridge on them. He was tried in a military court... he was sentenced to death... and executed. He's dead. That's what our people did, Michel. His brothers in arms. Gaby? Why aren't you asleep? - I'm thirsty. - Come here. Give me a kiss. Now go to sleep. Bring it here. Hello. Nadine, wash them, please. - Are you leaving? - Yes, I'm going home. - Will we see each other again? - I don't know. You brought the book back, okay. - Gaby? - Thanks. So... I filled a box with books for you. Take it. This is a wonderful poem. Keep it to remember us. Thanks. Ah, he woke up. See, how strong he is. He's a tough little guy. Will we release him? If you live in a country If you were born there If this is your country It is reflected in your eyes On your skin On your hands In the mane of her trees In the flesh of her earth In your bones are her stones In your blood are her rivers In you is her sky, her taste, In her men and her women Let me. Ana, back off. Come on, get out. That's right, be careful. Found her on the outskirts of Bukava. Stumbled upon her by chance on my way out of town. Thanks. Prothé, go make something to eat. Ana, help Prothé. Gaby, sit with your mother. I'll be right back. Bukabu has always been a hellhole, but you won't believe what's happening there now. On the streets, you will find 100,000 people. There is not even a vacant sidewalk. Did she tell you anything? No, she was silent the whole way. Gaby, turn on the lights on the terrace, please. Give Mom a kiss. Good night, Mom. Good night, Mom. You're not sleeping? Do you hear me? Forgive me. Gaby, hurry up! Ana, sweety, let's go. - Where is Mom? - Mom is sleeping. - I caught you! - Where are you going?! Goodbye, Mom. Hurry up! I'm coming! Hey, come here, Gaby! This is Gaby! Let's go. What is this? - The newspaper of Rwandan assassins. - Read us. "Hutu, remember: Tutsis are liars and traitors." "Hutus should not show mercy to them." - Bullshit. - I have an idea. Whoever gets three hits on the title, will get a beer. No, I'm going home. Stop it, wait! Francis, show him. Watch. - Come on, Gaby, try it! - No. - At least once. - No. Hi, Mom. Do you remember your cousins? Yes, of course I remember them. They were killed three months ago. Do you know what bodies look like three months after death? There is nothing left of the body. Just rot and stench. I tried to pick them up, but they slipped between my fingers. There were four stains on the floor. I tried my best to clean them off. I scraped the floor with my nails... but their blood was soaked into the concrete. Gaby... promise me that you will always be with me. But I am with you. Yes, but promise me. I promise you, Ana. - Good morning, Gaby, how are you? - Normal. Help me get Mom to the bedroom. Let's go, Yvonne. Let's get you up. That's right, darling. Well, shall we go? Help me. Please don't betray me. Hey, you! Did you see a boy with a yellow t-shirt? You and you! Search the house. On your knees! On your knees, I said! Now! Where's your master? Answer quickly! - He went north. - Where?! Why did he go? Answer! And what are you doing here? He left for work, and you burned down my house. Why did you stay here? - There are no Hutus here! - He's not here. I'm giving you a week. If you haven't left in a week, I'll kill you, got it? And you, tell your father that the French are not welcome in Burundi. Do you understand? That's it, let's go. We're going to the next house! Maybe the boy is there. Divide into groups and check everywhere! He couldn't have gone far. Why are you standing there? I said, quickly! This way. Thank you so much. God bless you. Give your mom a kiss and go to bed. Good night, Mom. Ana? What do you want? What are you doing? Get up. You want to forget your cousins? Sing for them. Come on, sing for them! Okay. ♪ Christiane... where are you? ♪ ♪ Christine... where are you? ♪ ♪ Where are you all, children? ♪ ♪ Christiane... where are you? ♪ ♪ Christine... where are you? ♪ ♪ Where are you all, children? ♪ Sing! ♪ Christine... where are you? ♪ Sing! Sing like Mom! Sing like Mom! Sing like Mom! Sing in Kinyarwanda! Come on, sing! ♪ Christiane... ♪ - Sing louder! Go higher! - ♪ Christine... where are you? ♪ Ana, you don't know Kinyarwanda. You don't know Kinyarwanda! Ana, how are you not ashamed? ♪ Christiane... ♪ What a shame! What a shame! You don't know Kinyarwanda! This is the language of your cousins! - Mom, stop it! - Come on, sing! And why are you interfering? You're a dirty Frenchman like your father! He left us to die there. - Sing, sing! I told you to sing! - Yvonne, stop it! - Sing! - Let her go, let her go! Yvonne, let her go! Gaby, help me! Yvonne, let her go! Let her go! Don't be afraid, darling. - Ana! - Ana! Listen, my little daughter is injured. - I'm driving her to the hospital. - Get out of the car! Get out! You know the rules! You have already seen me. Don't you remember? Here, look! Look. I will pay you. I have money! You know what you did in Rwanda? You know? - My daughter is injured. - I don't care. Let me through! I urgently need to go to the hospital! Pull back! Let me pass. Step back. Everything's fine. She has no fracture. If she gets a headache, give her a paracetamol. And in three weeks, you can remove the stitches for her yourself. - Thank you, doctor. - All the best. Dad, we have to go back to Mom. No, it's too dangerous. We'll spend the night here. - Prothé, have you seen Yvonne? - No, I haven't seen her. Mom! Monsieur! Monsieur. - Have you seen my mother? - No, I haven't seen her. - She's not here. - All right, let's go. - Good day. - Hello. Gaby! Ana, let's go. Mom is not here. Yes, we've already reported her disappearance to the police and the embassy. - I called all the hospitals. Nothing. - Gaby, let's go, quick. - There's been trouble. Hurry up. - None of the neighbors have seen her. Look what the dirty Hutus have done! They killed his father! - Do you see, Gaby? - Armand? The Hutus slaughtered his father in the middle of the street. Right next to our houses! Damn it! They impersonated vegetable traders, and when he came to buy something... Armand, is that true? Armand? Armand? Let's go, they are waiting for us! Hurry! Armand, let's go. Let's go. We looked everywhere for him. The boys rummaged the whole area. The boys did a really good job. - Clapton, hello. - Who are these white children? Everything is fine. Their mother is Tutsi. Are you the son of the murdered ambassador? - We're going to the beach. - Yes, boss. - They've already found your father's killer. - Let's go. Quiet! Quiet! Shut up! Don't shout! Silence! It's the Hutu who killed your father. - Don't. - Come on, beat him! - No. - Come on, Armand. What are you waiting for? Come on! Beat him, come on! It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Shut up! Beat him! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, boss. - What is going on here? - We found the ambassador's killer. - Where is that trash? Tie him up and get him in the car. No. Don't! Bastard, that's how you like it! Gaby, listen. Avenge your friend. It's time to choose. The French or the Tutsis? The Tutsis or the French?? Who are you with? Come on, Gaby! Revenge for Armand! Come on. I've decided you cannot stay here. I will send you to France to your grandparents. - Will you come, too? - No, I'm going to stay and look for Mom. Do you still love her? Yes, I love her, darling. Armand! Who do I see, Gaby! God, you have changed. BUJUMBURA - PRESENT DAY - How are you? - Me? Excellent. - And what is this? - Don't do that! Let me help you. Well, are we going there right away? The workers will come in an hour. - Yes, if you don't mind. - Let's go. - Did you put the picture there? - My mother. You wanted to see her when you come back. - Good day. - Hello. Where will the road go? To those stakes. These graves must be moved. Must be hard for the families. - Yes, poor people... - They will experience everything again. The grave is there. - You can access it there. - Understood. On top of that, the municipality requires them to pay for the exhumation. And it costs a fortune! - What happened to the documents? - Don't worry, I took care of everything. I took a plot of land near the Church of the Holy Family. - Your father will rest in peace. - Thanks. Careful, careful. Where did you find him? Right here. And Prothé was there. Your father tried to save him, but two against ten... - There? - Yes. Do you remember how we danced to this song? - Lucien! - Yes, Lucian liked to do it. - Yes, yes, exactly... - Exactly. He always forgot how to pronounce words... - Do you know anything about Gino? - No. He went to Belgium and I haven't heard from him since. - Nothing at all? - He hasn't contacted me. Gabby, you should know something... about your mother. I don't know how to tell you. That day, I didn't have the courage to tell you. Christiane, where are you? Where are you, children? Christiane, where are you? Christiane, where are you? Where are you, children? Christiane, where are you? Christiane, where are you? Where are you, children? Mom, it's me, Gabriel. Christiane? Christiane. Christiane, where are you? Christiane, where are you? Where are you, children? Christiane, where are you? Ana... Mom is here. All the years we've been looking for her, and three months ago... she returned to our old house and lived there. I will stay in Bujumbura to take care of her. I will wait for her condition to improve. Try to get here when you can.
