COMMERCE BANK Can't you see we're in the middle of a delivery? COMMERCE BANK Let's go. Calling all cars, we're going home. ANTI-GANG UNIT SEARCH AND INTERVENTION DIVISION You don't look much like winners. We got nothing. We are starting to wonder if he's waiting for Friday the 13th to act. In that case, we won't be held back, as it is Good Friday. Hello? Yes? Boss, it's the Director. So, Mr. Le Goff, do we have anything new regarding our Friday robbers? For a month now, every Friday at exactly 4:15 p.m., we find them in Boulogne. On the main square, in front of the bank. They're watching how the factory workers' wages are transported. And for the last three months, the Friday Man hasn't shown up. - Okay, here we go. - Well, yes, here we go! And we won't get anywhere until Sartet is sent to prison! Sartet. Why him? He doesn't have any sort of criminal record. But he keeps strange company. Little Nantais and Leather Coat? It might be for social reasons, his restaurant is very successful. Well, that might be a cover. You are stubborn, Le Goff. Sartet. Why Sartet? I don't know, intuition. He's a fast draw. Only a fly fishing fanatic like him could take a gun out that fast. All the testimonies from the previous hold-up concur. Look, next Friday is Good Friday. - The banks will be closed. - Not all of them. For the factory workers' wages, some companies like SICAM have asked them to open for an hour. Regardless, you should leave your men alone next week. You are becoming obsessed with this case. Next Friday at 4:20 p.m., we'll know for sure. Well, then, Roger. Is it time to eat yet? I'm so hungry right now, I could eat a horse! Oh, come on, I haven't even caught anything! I hope you only catch an old shoe! Would you like this lovely stiletto for your wife, Mister deputy prefect? My, look at that flick of the wrist and dexterity! And you put your hook wherever you want to, it's magic! And when you throw the fly, it's worse! Those who nicknamed you May Fly knew what they're talking about! If I had your flick of the wrist, my colleagues would go into a depression! He's a real beauty! And there you are! This is Hervé in Marseille. Pass this on to the anti-gang squad, Sartet is still fishing with the deputy prefect and Doctor Langlois. We will pass it on immediately. PUBLIC LIGHTING We leave in five minutes, Randier. Gentlemen, get ready. Toupir's rifle is loaded, gangsters beware! It's Marseille, Boss. Hello? Sartet was fishing ten minutes ago, about 40 minutes outside of Marseille. Stay in touch. Last flight from Marseille to Paris? Took off 30 minutes ago. The next one isn't before 5:30 p.m. Oh sorry, Boss. It's for my kid's birthday and I didn't have time to go home. James Bond, I see. If we were all James Bond, all criminals would have already been put away. Alright, we're canceling today's plans. Happy Easter to all of you. It might be Friday, but it's not April Fools! Marseille Marignane Airport. Calling all passengers who are traveling to Paris on additional flight number 312, are kindly requested to go to gate number five for immediate boarding. With the left foot! Left foot again but in stride this time. Long live Coach Alain Le Goff! That left is going to qualify France for the World Cup! Hey, that's forbidden for athletes. - You are a dictator. - Yep. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no girls, nothing! But you became champion thanks to your jerk of a stubborn cop brother. - Yeah. - Yeah. Kids, lunch is ready! - Come on, let's go! - No! Now come inside and dry off, please! Come along now! - Yes, yes. - Angèle! Angèle! We need towels and cologne. Angèle! Come along, take that off! - Here. - Thank you. How are you? Oh my goodness. Alain, telephone! - It's your office. - Excuse me. He has just left Marseille? They added a flight for the holiday? Wonderful! Send Merlu to Orly airport right away. And the others in position. When does my car get here? Good. The plan is back on. Are you running off? What about lunch? I can give up lunch after the news I've just received! He'll give up lunches, and dinners, and Sundays, too. And his wife, and her translations of crime novels. Investigations, arrests, professionalism, and your brother's career, however, all of that matters. - Forgive me, Angèle-- - "But I don't have time." Alain, please wait. - I don't have time. - I said wait! You are a pain in the neck. - Here. Come on, take this. - Yes, alright. I'll see you tonight. I'm not so sure. PARIS AIRPORT White to red. White to red. So, Boss, maybe today will finally be Friday with the Friday Man. Hello, this is red, I'm listening. Sartet just left Orly Airport in a taxi. - Alone? - Yes, alone. Keep in touch. Over. Red calling blue. Blue, can you hear me? Get into position, Sartet is on his way. Over. Red calling white. Standby and wait for orders. Over. This isn't the way to Boulogne! Follow him closely, hurry up! Hurry up! Shit. Black calling red. Black calling red! - So, did you lose him? - Well, shit! Meet back according to plan. Over. James Bond would not have lost his trail. Red to white, red to white. Go to Le Caneton. If Sartet shows up, let me know. Over. What do you think, Boss? I'll start thinking at 4:20 p.m. LE CANETON RESTAURANT COMMERCE BANK Red speaking. White calling red, Sartet is not at Le Caneton yet. Over. FINISH LINE 1000 METERS Say, you know, the cops at the robbery earlier, they seemed a little awkward, wasn't that strange? Definitely. And we got away. Yeah, but I don't believe in miracles. And we killed a cop, too. And when a cop dies, the entire department goes into a rage. What are you doing? We're going to hide the suitcase here. Are you crazy? We don't want to get caught with it in a raid. Hiding the suitcase here is risky. What if the workers find it? We'll get it back tomorrow. The cops' hunt will settle down when night falls. Hey, when he finds the huge truck the foreman is going to think Santa Claus is real. GOURMET MENU. 15 FRANCS. WINE AND SERVICE INCLUDED. Listen to me Everyone come over We're going to dance All night long Let it all out Everyone dance And here we go What should I play? Adamo... or Sonny? No, Louis XIV. Play Short Stuff's band again. We're going to dance, yeah! All night long Martine! Hey, Martine! Oh come on, Mother. Don't get upset, Mrs. Sartet. Hey, you the guitar player, enough! But we want to get married. My daughter is not marrying a loser! I'm not a loser, Mrs. Sartet. Don't worry, I'll get it together. I'll become the king of rock, top of the charts! Give me a little time and you'll see what I can do. You keep repeating the same thing every day. You should be looking for a serious job. - But Mother... - Don't be angry dear hostess, leave the lovebirds alone. His Majesty Louis XIV implores you. That is enough out of you! Oh, Mrs. Sartet. Me? Louis XIII's son? Louis XIII... You must be joking! He's even madder than the other guy! Gentlemen. Would you like a table? I would like to ask your husband a few questions. Mr. Sartet hasn't come home from Marseille yet, he's fishing. - I know. - But... I'm Commissioner Le Goff from crimes. Shit! The King's archers! What does this all mean? What do you want with my husband? This doesn't make any sense, Commissioner. What do you want with my father? - Go back behind the bar, Miss. - You can't make me. Don't make me give you a spanking. Hey, don't talk to her that way. - Quiet, Prince Charming. - Get off of me! Behave, kid. Hey! Leave it, he'll throw you in prison. That's Short Stuff. Short Stuff? A rocker. A former idol. That's the nickname people gave him. Go stand over there and don't move. Miss, get behind your counter. - Can you please explain? - Boss. Here he comes. Run! Get out! The cops are here! Good God, I don't even have a gun. Let's go in there. Since we're unarmed, they won't be able to do anything. Come, my friend, let's have a good laugh! Put your hands up! What's going on here, are you shooting a western? They're clean, Boss. The taxi driver, Boss. - Where was the pick up? - Pleyel Street in Saint-Ouen. - Did they have a suitcase with them? - Nothing. Let him go, take down his address. So, what's the title of your western? Toupir, stay with Scrisky during the search. We're going back to the station. Hey! Is this some kind of joke? I'm a business man! - Care to explain? - Father! Now, now. Ma'am, once my deputy finishes the search, please close your establishment. - And accompany him with your daughter. - But sir, we have customers tonight. Sorry, ma'am. But this type of decision warrants something very serious. It does. More than you realize. Do you have arrest and search warrants? Enough. Randier, take the rocker too. He can explain why he broke a window. - Roger, what have you done? - Don't you worry. This isn't the first time these men have caused a miscarriage of justice. Right? Let's go. Terrible. Can I smoke? No. Do you like that watercolor, Mr. Sartet? From my mother. She said I'd spend my life fighting windmills. Is that what you think too? Why did you arrest and handcuff me? What time did you get off your plane in Paris? At two o'clock this afternoon. And you didn't get home until seven? This is a little awkward. I'm married. I need the lady's name and address to verify your alibi. But she's married too, Commissioner. I don't even know her address. We met at my restaurant and planned to see each other this afternoon. On Clichy Square. At Le Wepler. Why not the train station? Hundreds come through Le Wepler, unverifiable alibi. - And then? - Well, we had a drink. You know, the usual booth cooing. What is the hotel's address? No hotel, unfortunately. Shame, I could have checked it. - All I did was take her home in a taxi. - To which address? I told you I didn't know. But you went with her. Next to where she lived. According to what she said. She's like me, she doesn't trust you. You know, it's just starting between her and me. And between you and me too. Keep going. Where did the taxi stop? On Pleyel Street in Saint-Ouen. And then to Le Caneton? The driver himself told you that he picked me up on Pleyel Street. I paid the first taxi to stay with the lady a little longer, then I took a second taxi. It's a shame that you picked an honest woman. You wouldn't be here right now. Can I have a cigarette? And you met your friend on Pleyel Street? - Yeah. - He's a discreet man. He's a friend. Is he aware of your good fortune? And you of his convictions for robbery? Him? You must be joking, Commissioner. - I rarely joke, Mr. Sartet. - Can I smoke? No. Who were you with on Pleyel Street? With my friend, Mr. Sartet. - Who else? - A lady. You gentlemen are cautious. And Boulogne? Was he there ten years ago with a girl? To make a deposit at Commerce Bank? A deposit? Are you joking? I've never trusted banks. What do you think about Boulogne, René? Where's Boulogne? Does he have an alibi? Taking a stroll on the boulevard. Lock him up. Commissioner! Commissioner! Are you going to keep me longer? What, you're not happy? This is your moment of glory. - You sure you want to stay silent? - I can tell you-- - What? - I've said everything I know. No weapons, cash or masks at his place. Same for Limousin, Leather Jacket and Sartet. - Alibi? - I went to see a movie. Then you can tell us all about it. That's tough, it was a Godard. We just brought La Gambille in. Where did you find him? Making a deal, he was betting on horses. - He knows anything about Boulogne? - He's clueless. - And at his place? - Nothing. Alright, thank you. We need one of them to talk. We'll have to let them go soon, if I don't have any proof-- Those jerks will be free and guilty. The Director is in your office. Oh, boy. So my friend, let's do this. You were at the movies? - Yeah. - Give me a break. You're making a serious mistake, sir. I own my restaurant. It's successful. I mean, really, sir... look at me. Can you picture me with a gun in hand? I love fishing, nature, the quiet, a good meal. Basically, the opposite of a crook. Ask the people in my neighborhood, or Doctor Langlois in Marseille and the deputy prefect. No. This is a mistake, sir, I swear to you. You're sure about this, right? If I'm wrong, I'll resign. No need to be uncompromising. I'm sorry, but I am used to taking responsibility. - Boss. - What's wrong? Larmeno's wife is on the phone, asking what time he'll be home. Hello. Mrs. Larmeno? Le Goff here. No, no, don't worry. He's out. Not sure what time he'll be back. I'll ask him to call you as soon as he gets back. Have a good evening. That was the wife of the man who died this afternoon. Ring a bell, Sartet? Ring a bell? Why are you hounding me? I'm sorry he died, but what can I do about it? Take care of those punks! - I'll go and see her tomorrow. - I'll come with you. Hang on, Le Goff. Well? How much longer am I going to be here? Well? They're not giving anything up. We're not getting anywhere. Absolutely nowhere. And yet... Alright, Johnny Guitar, the boss would like an autograph. - Well, it's about time. - Yeah, move it. - Hello, Mr. Sartet. - Start talking. The broken window? I'm fond of Martine's father. But not of the cops. I seem to be allergic to them. Your act is an obstruction of justice, you could get three months. He doesn't care. These kids couldn't care less. You deserve a good smack. I don't do smack. Do you realize you could have started a shootout? It was a reflex, I guess. To protect him? What do you know about him? Well, he's Martine's father. I'm sending you back to the streets, where you came from. If I keep you here, the press'll cover you and you'd love that. But not if you're free. - Get out of here. - Go. Understand? Remind me what time you got to Orly Airport? - Oh come on, Commissioner. - What time? At two o'clock. - In the afternoon? - Yes. Leather Jacket, this is taking too long. Oh, but I've told you everything. Saint-Ouen, Pleyel, a taxi with Sartet. And then the lady, another taxi, and we went back to Le Caneton. Don't you have anything else to say? Sure, I'm from the Vendée region. I was born on July 19, 1903, my father was a gem cutter. My mother's name was Léontine, my father was Auguste, and my godmother, Ann. My mother made brooms. She cleaned people's homes, used her own brooms. Stand up. Stand up. How did it happen? - I fell. - On the sidewalk in Boulogne? Take the bandage off. - He's got a bullet in his calf, Boss. - It's nothing. I got into it with a guy last night in Montmartre. He shot me. What are you saying, Barani? He's got a bullet in his calf. Call the doctor. And if it's the type of bullet I think it is, well then... I'll make you talk. And you'll also confess that you're the Friday Man. You don't give up, do you? Lock him up while we wait for the ballistics report. Roger, tell me what they're saying isn't true. Tell me that you're not a criminal! They're crazy, right? Commissioner, it can't be true! This can't be possible! You must have made a mistake! I beg of you. Ask around the neighborhood. People love him, there's no one better. He's always willing to lend a hand. Martine. In Saint-Ouen, 12 Avenir Street, there's a construction site. The pile of sand next to a hut. There’s a suitcase buried. Take it somewhere safe. Looks great! Let's get a close up. There. Great. Wait, hang on just a second. One last photo. And just one more. Over here, excellent. It's up to the judge to decide his fate. Can we get a photo? Why are you involving them? Alright, Randier, let these ladies go home. Let them through. Calm down, Martine, calm down. Those asshole cops have made you emotional. Martine. Let's take your mind off things, let's go and get a drink, you and me. I know it's not the best time, but... Drive, Georges. Okay, but where to? 12 Avenir Street. In Saint-Ouen. - But there aren't any bars in that area. - Drive. Is this a treasure hunt? Shit, a metal case. Are these our Easter eggs? Oh boy, it's really heavy. Maybe it’s bars of gold. Ha! It's Romeo and Juliet. Calm down, Martine. They left. - Hey. - Where shall we go, Georges? Where else could we go with this case but my place? Shall we open it? Oh shit. Look at all this cash! You realize there's a lot of it here! So that was it? You didn't dare set me free? Well, shit! Mr. Sartet. Maybe it wasn't him! Maybe it was his friend Leather Jacket. Maybe Father was doing him a favor. Martine! Check this out! A machine gun! Hey, masks! Out of the way! Tremendous! Your diamonds, princess. Hurry! Oh, Martine! I was just joking. Martine, calm down. This can't be what he's doing with his life. Tell me he didn't kill that policeman. Tell me, Georges... It's hard news to take. But that's the way it is. No... You know, Martine, I'm an orphan. So I don't know what it's like to suddenly learn that your father is a criminal. Maybe I would have liked it. Seeing your father in prison? But you forget the glory. The newspapers, television. I've experienced it, too. You can't imagine how it feels. You're nothing and then all of a sudden, people recognize you on the street. You can no longer buy the newspaper. You're king of the world. That's a bad comparison! His life is at stake, do you hear me? His life! They can't accuse him right now, they have no proof. And the proof is here. Artillery, masks and money. - One, two, three. - He's worth more. If you listen to them, if you steal so much as an orange, you ruin the entire economy. They found a bullet in Leather's leg. Your father's friend. They shot him today in Boulogne, during the hold-up. You know... if that's true then it's Waterloo. Tell me... do you think we can use this money? What for? I'm tired of my misfortune. I want to add spice to my godforsaken life. Hello, La Loco? This is Short Stuff. Get me Louis XIV. What are you going to do? Show them that Short Stuff is not as over as they think he is. THE CRICKET GRILL - After you! - Please! Come, Cinderella! Georges, please, are you mad? - Don't you worry, Martine, piece of cake! - Georges. Come on, get the door. - In the name of the law, open up! - Go, hurry! - Hi, Martine. - Hi. Quit it! Hey, man! I thought the archers had sent you rowing on my galleys. His galleys, here he goes again. Since we named him Louis XIV. I do have a king's nose. Alright, enough. It's downstairs. I've got an American car, it's this long. Good job, Bosco. Alright fellas, look closely. Shit. Those are real bills. - How... How much? - Two grand. Two thousand? - Each. - Each? Yeah. The Dandy, enough to change suits every day of the year, huh! - Broken Nose, you-- - I know! A collection of brand new noses. - Louis XIV. - Enough to buy a home worthy of me. Versailles! Bosco. It won't straighten me out, but it will help girls forget. The only thing, guys, is that it all goes with this. - That's unbelievable. - They're real! We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas-- Cut the crap and stop yelling! This money is not a gift. You've got to earn it. What's the job? So, for those guys, rabbit pâté and Beaujolais wine. Leroy, come and help me carry all this. To think that we have to deal with the likes of you instead of enjoying Easter eggs. The bullet was shot by Larmeno. The expert assessment confirms it. So, what do you have to say about that? So, Sartet, are you talking? Regarding Leather Jacket, Larmeno's bullet is enough to sentence him. And we'll find the proof against you. Because we have time, Sartet. We can do anything. Shave, shower, eat. Even take a piss without asking for permission. We can smoke, too. And we can sleep. Keep going, Randier. I'm going to lie down for a bit. So... We're almost there. Going to the cops to free Sartet. You're even crazier than I thought! The hardest part is getting out. Getting in is a piece of cake. Can't a good Christian go for a visit? Guys. I'm scared, guys. I don't think you realize that no one attacks the police! We won't get out alive! Well, then, it would be a first! A first ascent! The north face of police headquarters, is rightfully ours, the youth's! But you guys are crazy... You guys are nuts! You getting cold feet? The Dandy, return the cash and get out of here. - But... - Anyone else want out? Bosco? That's insulting. - Broken Nose? - Go, go. Louis XIV? I'm a blue blood, what do you think? The cash, The Dandy. - Let's go back while there's still time. - The cash. Better die than lose you as friends. Drive, Bosco. Look, he was supposed to stay downstairs while you guys got the job done, we're going to switch. You can stay in the car. Thanks. But I'll go upstairs. We resume with the seventh round. He stayed seated. He was hit hard twice. Now all the arena is on their feet. And now we have a real fight on our hands. Are we going to have a new champion of France? So, Sartet, you're still not talking? Stop! - Leave him, Randier! - Sartet ran away! - Do you think the cop's dead? - Shut up! Bosco. Alright, fellas, you need to hide, scatter. The Dandy, lay low for a while. - I move tomorrow. - What about the cops? No worries, I'll find a way to ditch them. - Bye, fellas. - See ya. Hello? But you're not hurt? And the others? Oh, thank God. I told you it was insanity. - Yes, at your place tomorrow. - Martine. What's going on, Martine? Nothing, Mother, wrong number. Hello? - Toupir? - Toupir is fine. And Vrillard's wife? She's having a hard time. Harder than Larmeno's wife. I read the report and I agree with you, it was a reckless job. - Pardon me. - Of course. - Could you make some more? - Yes. - With a little brandy? - Yes. Brandy this early? My goodness. You're right. You have to be reckless to attack police headquarters. Which means it was young guys. Very young. And not one of them had gloves on. Professionals would have thought about fingerprints. Short Stuff? What if I lose you too? What if they find out one day? How in the world would they know? I'm not even sure your father recognized me. What about the others? Louis XIV, Broken Nose. What do they think? They're okay. Trying to forget about the cop your father shot. They're still joking around. Though, sometimes... Though sometimes? Well, regardless it's too late to turn back now. You're not nervous, are you? Sometimes I'm ashamed. JOBIC LE GOFF IN GREAT SHAPE And other times, I think, "he's my dad." IS THIS THE FRIDAY MAN UNMASKED? What are you thinking about all of a sudden? Your soul. What are you doing? You know I have to go. MONTMARTRE FUNICULAR Sacré Coeur, departing now. Let's go guys, drive! Welcome to Versailles, friends! Don't you feel like you're in the Petit Trianon? What, this rat hole? If only we'd named you Louis XVI. You would no longer annoy us. Oh, oh, shit! Now, now, no foul language, your Majesty. And no touching! This is not yours. It's not yours either, fellas. The money is Sartet's. He won't claim it anytime soon. How do you know, Bosco? Two grand extra for each of you. - Would you like that? - I thought it wasn't for us? Do you want it? When I think about the other night, I get a little nervous. You can join The Dandy. The Dandy's out? He chickened out, remember. What kind of trouble are you getting us into now? The good kind! I'll tell you in the car, which Bosco is going to get for us. Right, here. - For your Trianon. - Yes! For my Trianon. No, that is used, Bosco. It's for my Trianon! With all this gold, I'm going to ask Lenôtre to design my gardens! NORWAY - 0 FRANCE - 0 That wasn't offside, Jobic scored! Down with the referee! Down with the referee! Down with the referee! Down with the referee! Le Goff was offside earlier. Why are you booing the referee? Silence, ignorant man! Why don't you go to hell? Oh, how dare you-- Shut up! Put him in his place! - He's been bribed. - Been what? Be quiet, damn it, Jobic has the ball! Go! Go, France, go! Jobic! Hey geezer, was that offside? I'm not talking to you, sir. Well, I'm talking to you, and screw you! Without that goal, France won't be in the World Cup! You old geezer. NORWAY - 0 FRANCE - 1 Hey, are you crazy? What are you doing? It's me! What are you doing? Shut up! He really should have come home by now. I know. What on Earth can he be doing? That's not very nice of him, he could have come home to celebrate his victory. Well, that's it. After that kind of victory, he's with a bunch of girls competing for a drink with him. - And by drink, I mean-- - Jobic is not like that. No, of course not. - Hello? - Commissioner Le Goff? - Who is this? - Doesn't matter. Give and take. Let Sartet go, get your brother back. I don't care, man, figure it out. Be quick. I'll call tomorrow. Hello? And don't forget, you'll only see your brother again once Sartet is safe, not before. Of course, if you'd rather find his dead body. TRAGEDY FOR ANTI GANG UNIT COMMISSIONER FRANCE STRIKER KIDNAPPED Hello? Bye. That was an informant, he talked to people all night. He agrees with the other informants, the mafia didn't kidnap your brother. We would already know about it. Well, it's not suburban gangs or old friends of his. Yes? Public opinion says to deal with the kidnappers. That's inconceivable. We know that Sartet killed Vrillard. Maybe Larmeno, too. But this is your brother. But a gangster, too. The most despicable ever. We're no longer in control. Because of your brother's fame, it's gone national. All the media outlets are drowning in phone calls and telegrams. France wants its new idol back. Le Goff. Don't do anything else without talking to me. I have a meeting with the Minister of the Interior. What's new at Le Caneton? The mother and daughter aren't moving and wiretapping is in vain. And Short Stuff? He hasn't been home since we lost him at the funicular. Yeah! That's good stuff. Yeah, this is good. - Your turn. - Bosco, I'm going to roll 405 in one go! - Go for it. - Are you guys nuts or what? You're juggling with a grand like it's nothing. We have our whole lives to get more. Come on, Rothschild, roll! Well, if idiots could fly, you'd already be on Venus. Enough about Venus, I made us a pot pie. It's a recipe by my head chef, Mr. Vatel. - I know Vatel! - You do? He plays drums for Red Cabbage. What world are we living in? A Bourbon. The ancestor of-- Of the guillotined, we know. Um, maybe we shouldn't talk about that-- Stop that! We're not losers. Like on TV, Steve McQueen and the others, they always get out. Hey, guys, the only difference is, we're not on TV. Or in the movies. Are you making fun of us? Don't move. - Who is it? - The Dandy. See my new threads? I want to show you the car I bought. It's a wonder! Are the guys here? Still mad about the other night? You all are, huh? You are, I can feel it. - Let's go and see that car of yours. - Come on! It didn't cost me much, it's a gas guzzler! Do you realize this is worse than having a sign on your back? And these clothes! I told you spending your money would draw attention. But this is a lifelong dream. A dream? We're all going to end up in the slammer. Get out of here before crowds gather. Once they get their idol back, the public will turn against us. We're used to getting spat on. Kidnappers usually kill their victims. We don't have to free Sartet, just track him. So he can take us to your brother. And what if he's still able to escape, despite everything we set up? These official orders came from the Ministry. And I'm asking you to follow them, period. - Commissioner! - Commissioner! Are you just going to let this happen? They want us to free that thug? He killed Vrillard! Orders are that the public not know anything yet. That's why people in high places are making this kind of joke. But I will have no part of it. Officials are talking about exchanging Roget Sartet, known as May Fly for Jobic Le Goff, the French team's striker. - Mother! - More information to come soon. Now back to... They're letting him go? Yes, but I won't be part of it. What do you mean? What I just said. Are you forgetting that Jobic's life is at stake? Leave us, Mother. You really want this May Fly guy, huh? Your career won't end when you take him to the gallows. - But you admire Jobic, you love him. - Exactly. I'm trying to find an alternative to the exchange. - Good, huh? - Yes, but this isn't my diet. You're on a special diet? Like jockeys. Raw carrots and grilled meat. And no wine. If my brother could see me now! Is that forbidden too? Totally. Even girls. Well, not too often, anyway. Oh, shit! Carrots, grilled meat, no wine, no girls, no cigarettes, being a champion is no fun! - Oh, well. - Hey, Jobic, wouldn't you like to meet Pele? Hey, buddy, what do you think? Pele's a hotshot, right? My dear friends, I am going to award Pele the order of the Holy Spirit. Award him a drink instead. Listen, when you scored that goal, it was amazing. How did you do it? Well, I didn't do it alone. It was a team effort. I'm nothing without them. I wouldn't have scored without Artelza's pass. He moved the ball to the center, I got it from him, I dribbled it-- Okay, yeah, you dribbled, but how'd you get through? Well... - Well-- - Show us. Well? I went like this... Hey, do you have a ball? There. Jobic, here you go. Yeah! Are you okay? You won't run away if we untie you? Let's go, Jobic! Well done, fellas. Have you lost your minds? You going to take him to the dance, too? - Oh, come on, it's Jobic! - So? He said that without his friends, there would have been no victory. It's true, a match is a team effort. On the field, it's the same as in life, they lean on each other. Tell me, Champ, when you came up on the Norwegian defense, I didn't think you'd get through. How'd you do it? You were so fast! - Here, show us! - Let's go, Jobic! Come on, shoot the ball! And now here is news on the Roger Sartet case. In the face of public pressure, authorities have decided to let Roger Sartet go free tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. France hopes to get back its idol, Jobic Le Goff. - Police did not give in to blackmail... - Shut up! ...and does not believe Roger Sartet to be the Friday Man. That was our six o'clock bulletin. And now, back to our regular programming and a vintage song that's still relevant today by Short Stuff and his band.

Strange way to thank us. My life is at stake. But we need to get out of here. And so do you. There's a car outside for you. I'll decide when we leave. At nightfall. Don't play that game, kids. You don't even trust me anymore? I trust no one. Everybody against the wall. Come on, let's go. Where did you get the money for that car and those clothes? - Answer him. - You should see it all, Boss. A suit, silk shirt, fancy shoes, he's a real dandy. Where did you buy it? - The Boss is talking to you. - Answer! I played the lottery... I might get angry and it's going to hurt! - But I promise! - And I promise you'll talk. What if we changed the subject? On the day before Easter, some punks attacked police headquarters in costume. - And they killed. - Talk you scoundrel, talk! Short, Short, Short... Answer! - Where's Short Stuff? - I don't know. Where is he? Answer him! - Where? - I don't know! - Answer me! - Where! - Talk! - Maybe... At Louis XIV's! Roger Sartet, we know you're in there. Come out with your hands up. You don't stand a chance. We've surrounded the area. Listen to me carefully, Sartet. You have one minute. Don't take these men down with you. Think about your daughter. You assholes! You've been owned. Hey, don't insult us. Shut up! Sartet. You have 20 seconds left. Come out immediately, Sartet. Come out immediately. Don't move! You're coming with me. Come on. We're going to see what your brother does. - Where are you going? - Just stay put, guys! You're already in the shit because of me. I want you to stay here, you hear me? Shit! Start walking, let's go. Throw your gun away, Short Stuff! You too, Sartet! Back up! And get the cops out of here! I want my freedom in exchange for your brother's! Bring a car over here, cop. And clear the street. You'll drive. You made a mistake, Commissioner. I still had one chance, this one. Alain! Don't worry about me! Come and arrest this thug! But the bastard would kill you! Hey, Champ, shut your trap or... He won't dare shoot me! My death will be his suicide! Come over here, old man! Don't let this thug impose the law on you! Back up, cop. - Back up. - Come on, Alain! Come on! Coward! Letting him push you around. You, the Commissioner. Be quiet, you idiot, he'll kill you! You gave me a minute! I'm giving you ten seconds. After that, I'll be out of luck. So will everyone else. Move it, for Pete's sake! Ten more seconds, cop. Come on! Move it! You asked for it, cop. One second left. Come on. Stop! Stop! I said stop! Stop! I said stop! No! Short Stuff, come here! Stop acting like an idiot! Come back here, asshole! Well, cop... you get to add me to your trophy wall. Keep scoring goals, Champ. He's a good guy, he's got a good mindset. My buddies too. Really, they're good guys. Everything is my fault. All they did was honor friendship. They're just kids. Kids. Poor kid. Come on, let's go. Subtitle translation by: Florence Beretta
