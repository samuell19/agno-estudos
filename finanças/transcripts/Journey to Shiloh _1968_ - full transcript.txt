Well, he's gotta be somewhere. Any of you boys want some more... You just keep a-comin'. There he is. Let's go get him. Get him out! Get him out! Come on, buck! Yeah! Bet they never let us in that town again. I don't know, looks like they handled us pretty good. You concho county boys, maybe. Not ol' j.C. J.c., I'd like to split your head wide open. I ain't finished with them. Sure you are. We got ridin' to do. I'm ridin'. Right back to Dallas. Pretty good with bottles... let's see how they are with guns. Let it go, j.C. I don't let nothin' go. You're too damn touchy, j.C. Don't tell me what I am. You ain't goin' back. I said I am. You gonna try and stop me? Now, you know I can't match you gun-for-gun, j.C. You better believe it. And I said I'm going. Anybody arguing? Well... Have it your way. J.c.'s the stubbornest critter. Get him on his horse. He's gonna be mean when he wakes up, buck. Y'all elected me captain. I didn't much want the job. As long as I got it, I give the orders. He knew that when he wanted to join up. I doubt he ever believed it. Man took an oath. Let's go. J.c., I told you we had riding to do. I know what you told me. You hit me when I wasn't looking. Wasn't no other way. I ain't forgettin' it, buck. You mind that. Oh, I'll mind it. Nobody sneak-hits j.C. Sutton. Suit yourself, j.C. Sutton. Willie bill? How far you reckon we made today? 35, 40 miles. Ain't enough. We'll be all summer gettin' to Richmond. And by the time we get there, won't be no war. Yeah, I've been thinkin' about that. Come on, now, we'd better get some sleep. Buck? Hmm? You remember what I said. Oh, yeah. I'll toss and turn over it all night. Mmm-mmm! Pinto beans and jerky. There ain't nothin' better. Seein' as how we ain't et nothin' else since we left home, you're mighty easy to please, little bit. Somebody comin'. You're right here in the middle of it. Do tell? Nice land. Suits me fine. You're trespassing. It don't seem like we're hurting it none. Maybe you think we are. Maybe you'd like to throw us off. J.c... I want to see these dudes throw us off. Nobody said anything about throwing anybody off, did they? As long as you're just camping, I guess you're not hurting anything. That's right friendly. Thank you. Step down. Have a bean. What's that you're eatin'? Pinto beans and jerky. That's real frontier food. That's where we brung it from... concho county. Concho county? That's clear the other side of pecos. There's still Indians out there! Them that we left alive, there is. We're the concho county comanches. We're on our way to Richmond, Virginia. We're gonna join up with general hood's Texas brigade. Is that right? This here is buck Burnett. He's our captain. I'm proud to know you, captain. I'm Carter claiborne. This is my brother custis. Glad to know ya. You really going to Virginia? That's right. We heard tell general hood needs some good horse soldiers. We reckon we're the best there is. We're just afraid they're gonna run out of Yankees before we get there. Boy, all the way to Richmond. Sure wish I could do that. Why don't you come along with us? We got plenty of room. You mean it? Sure. We got room, ain't we, buck? We ain't talked about recruiting anybody, but... You got guns? 'Course we got guns. What would your folks say? Well, we'll talk to them tonight. Yeah. Captain Burnett, you wanna come to a party? What kind of party? It's what they call a cotillion. At our place. In honor of cousin arybelle. She's from Alabama. There'll be dancin' and bourbon punch and food and everything. You gotta come. Maybe be there when we talk to our folks. This cousin arybelle of yours. She pretty? She's the prettiest thing you ever saw. Sounds kinda fancy for us. Come on, general. We've been invited to a party. We're camping here tonight anyway. Ain't no harm in going. He's right, buck. There ain't no harm in lookin' at a pretty girl. We'd be glad to have you. With you going to war and everything, pa will probably make you honored guests. Come on, buck. It'd do us good. Well, I guess we can scrub up in that creek, yonder. No reason we can't go. Now you're talkin'. You tell 'em stand by, because concho county comanches are gonna show 'em how to throw a party. Right, Miller? My goodness. If you young gentlemen ain't a sight. Is there something wrong? Uh, nothin'. We've never seen one of you before. Well, there's a heap of us around. Not where we come from. Where is that, gentlemen? Concho county. Way out west of here. My, my. You're a long ways from home. Gonna be longer. Headin' for Virginia. Ain't that nice. You know, where the war is. We're gonna fight the Yankees. I hear tell the Yankees is fightin' us. I hear tell they're mighty mean. I reckon we'll whip 'em, though. We? Yes, sir. Us southerners. Uh, you live here? Yes, sir. I runs the cotton gin for colonel claiborne. Yo, buck. I swear his house is better than mine. I never seen a slave before. We just folks, sir. Only difference is, we belong to colonel claiborne. He's a mighty fine gentleman. Um, claiborne house down this way? Yes, sir. Right on up that road a mite. Y'all goin' to the party? We sure are. Well, I hope you have a real good time. And good luck with them Yankees. Yeah, thank you. Let's go. So long. Doggone! Never seen the likes. Did you hear what he said, "us southerners"? What do you suppose he meant by that? Well, he lives here, don't he? He sure ain't a northerner. Buck, somethin' don't make sense. Yeah. Damned if I know what it is. Will ya look at that? Are we supposed to go in there? Maybe this ain't the place, huh, buck? It's the place, all right. Are we goin' in? We been invited, ain't we? J.c.'s right. We been invited, it wouldn't be fittin' if we didn't go. I'd rather take a whuppin'. Come on. We're as good as they are. Besides, I aim to get myself a good look at cousin arybelle. Come on, buck, let's go. Yep. Yes, gentlemen? That's all right, Benjamin. These are my friends. Very well, Mr. Carter. Well, come on. They'll take your horses. All these darkies yours? We run a couple hundred of 'em. They ever give you any trouble? Why would they give us any trouble? Well, it just figures. They're ours. This is their home. Don't you have any niggras? Uh, what we got's injuns. Well, they surely aren't the same. The way the Yankees talk about slaves, you'd think we keep 'em in chains and beat 'em twice a day. It isn't like that. Well, we got a lot to learn. Come on. It's already started. Well, Carter, I don't know. I seen them people go in there, dressed in those ruffled shirts and all. Look at us. But you're soldiers. You're not supposed to look like civilians. He's got a point there, buck. We come this far, be a shame not to go the rest of the way. Well, uh... I, uh, thought a captain was supposed to lead. All right, let's go. Captain buck Burnett and the concho county comanches. Aaah! Somebody get them out of here! Pa, they're soldiers. They're going to the war. Get them out of here, Edward! Outside, gentlemen. Quickly, now. Outside. I invited them. They're soldiers! They are savages! They don't belong here! I invited them. I'm throwing them out! Now, you get upstairs 'fore I forget how old you are and take a strap to you! These gentleman are not to be allowed in the house again! That ain't no way to treat soldiers. If that's all they think about men who are gonna fight for them. Is there a war going on or ain't there?! Come on, let's get outta here. Don't go. Please! Captain Burnett, don't go. If anyone belongs here, you do. The folks here in Texas just don't feel the war the way we do in Alabama. Their behavior towards you was inexcusable. Well, ma'am, I... I guess can't much blame 'em. We're not really dressed for a party. Well, you're soldiers of the confederacy. You're goin' out to fight their war. Well, I'm ashamed of 'em. And I'm ashamed of myself for standing by and saying nothing. As an Alabama patriot, I implore you, come back inside. Oh, uh, no, I don't think we'll do that, ma'am. A man can bit once by a rattler, by accident, he gets bit twice, why, that's just being stupid. Then please accept my apologies. And my gratitude for the brave and noble thing you're doing. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Ma'am, we don't know much about this here war, but as long as there are ladies like you supporting it the way you do, I'm sure the south can't help but win. We'll remember what you said when we get to the war. It'll help us from gettin' tired. Yes, ma'am. May god bless you and keep you, every one. Yes, ma'am. I tell you, boys, I'm in love. My heart's plumb gone. Arybelle. Arybelle. Whoo! What do you think, buck? Hmm? About what? Them claiborne boys. Do you reckon they're gonna join up with us? I wouldn't put my money on it, Miller. Seen that house, what they got... I figure you're rich enough, maybe you don't feel so much like fighting a war. Some people might find it tough to give up everything they got for beans and jerky. They're southerners, ain't they? Maybe that ain't enough, just bein' southerners. Awright, let's go. Let's shake this dust. Wanna get some place where folks feel more kindly about the war. All right, head 'em out. Well, good as the finest house I ever did see. So this here's Louisiana, huh? Near as wet as Texas. I'm gettin' under six feet of hay and sleepin' for a week. Not me... I got plans. We all got plans, j.C. You got yours and I got mine. Well, boys, we got us a problem. Stock's pretty sad. Little bit, your buckskin's popped a splint, your horse's filled a pastern, and Willie bill, you been ridin' a saddle gall all week. If we're gonna get to Richmond while there's still a war on, we're gonna have to do something. I've been thinking. We got nothin' to worry about. Well, I'll go to shreveport first thing in the morning and find us a dealer, sell him our stock and gear, buy some tickets on the next stage to vicksburg and have a couple of dollars to spare. We're gonna have to take a vote on it. He goes with me. What do you mean, he goes with you? I mean, I'm moving on. I'm tired of you toy soldiers. You can't do that, j.C. You took an oath. Yeah, to the concho county comanches. Well, I'm from maynard county, and I don't like the way things have worked out. You're treating us like we're all a bunch of schoolkids. Well, I'm a man, and I do things my way. I ain't gonna let you go. You think you can stop me? Any of ya? Come on and try. Now, you simmer down. No, I'm simmering out. I come along to fight, and as far as I'm concerned, the fightin' can start right now. That way, huh? Get your hands out from underneath those ponchos! Come on, I wanna see 'em! Willie bill! You better drop that knife. Y'all pretty sneaky, aren't ya? From now on, I write the rules. Now, come on, hunch up, all of ya. Now, j.C... You shut up... Or I'm gonna blow your belly out. Now, move! Maybe you think I forgot, buck, the way you cold-cocked me when I wasn't iookin'. Well, I ain't! Little bit, flop him over and dig me out 50 dollars. You can't do that, j.C. You took an oath. Give me that money! Just 50. I'm only taking what I figure my share is. Any of you chicken-gutters got any objections? Adios, soldados. Them maynard county boys sure are a crazy bunch. Took a good one. You all right, buck? I'm all right. J.C. Said he'd get me. He sure did. What you gonna do now, buck? Go get him. He was boiling, buck. He'll be trouble. That's desertion. Can't allow it. Let him be, buck. He only took the 50 dollars that was his. We're better off without him. Nope. He's a might touchy, but think what a good soldier he'd make for general hood. Miller... You're captain while I'm gone. Take the horses and gear into town and get the best price. Sure thing, buck. Get the tickets and wait for me at the stage depot. He's mighty previous with that gun of his. You watch him. Yeah, I know it. If it should happen I'm not there on time, you leave without me. That's an order. You mind what I said, Miller. I'll do it, buck. Good luck with j.C. Yeah. Two. Two. It's your bet. The bet is 20. That's a sucker bet, j.C. Maybe I didn't hit you hard enough. How do you figure that's a sucker bet, Texas? You're buckin' too many hands... Like hers. Blow away, general. Your bet. It's too rich for me. I'll tell ya what. Seein' as how you're busted, I'll take it easy on ya. You do that. I'll call ya, friend. I call. His hand's rigged. No, thank you, ma'am. Did you say something, cowboy? Well, uh, my friend, he's just been on that bottle, and I don't think he should be playing. That's his problem. Not yours. All right, friend, I called. Queens. Full. No good! Jack high straight flush. In diamonds. How many ten of diamonds is there in this game? All right, on the table. Buck... It hurts... Honey, you count out the 50 he brung in here. Sal. Wait. Now count out 30 for yourself. For me? Why? You look it up in the Bible, lady. 30 pieces of silver, that's what the job pays. Well, go ahead. Now, anybody want to follow me outside, take back what they think is his is welcome. It's all right, cowboy. You're goin' out clean. Just keep goin'. What's going on here? Bunch of cheats robbed my friend and killed him when he didn't like it. Sonny, we don't like texans coming into our town making loose charges. Now, you give me that gun. That way, huh? All right. Here's 50 dollars. That oughta be enough to get my friend buried. You take care of that, sheriff. I expect you got that much decency. You give me that gun, boy. You come any closer, you're gonna get this gun. Now, back off. Now, everybody stand pat. Whoa, now! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa. Buck! Buck! Yahoo! Get back. We got a schedule to keep. He's got a ticket. Here. How'd you get out, buck? I rode faster'n they shot. Where's your horse and gear? Sold 'em to a farmer. Hurry up. Hey! Colonel, this here's buck Burnett. He's our captain. Colonel cooney, buck Burnett. Howdy. Nice to know ya, colonel. You a real colonel? Well, that's an honorary title, son, purely honorary. I reckon you all will meet up with a real one soon enough. Buck, we heard about j.C. That's a hell of a note. Yeah. Well, I guess he was born to die that way. So, you're all gonna join the heroic forces of the stars and bars, eh? The south needs every man she can get. If only I were 20 years younger... Ten years. I reckon you would, colonel. It's a noble thing. I only wish there were more people that felt about it the way you do. Now, you take shreveport... A den of iniquity, son. A den of iniquity! And I can assure you that it is not representative of the confederacy. We are a united nation engaged in a holy crusade. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Why, howdy, case. Howdy, colonel. How many you runnin' down today, case? Just one big buck took off this morning. Oh, case pettibone here, he's overseer for ol' general gainsford. Ain't no niggras gonna get away from ol' case. Runaway, huh? Not for long, son, not for long. You got the dogs out, eh, case? Yep. Ben Swayze's pack, too. Likely you'll hear them open up 'fore you get to munroe. That'll be somethin' to hear. If you see that buck, colonel, fire off a couple of shots. Dogs'll hear it. We'll do it, case. We'll do it. Heel, now! All right, get out there! Why do you suppose he run away? Oh, you run into a bad one every now and then. Tries to get across the red into Texas. But he don't stand much of a chance with ol' case after him. That pettibone, he looks awful mean. Well, you don't run a hundred field hands by being friendly, Sonny. That's Ben Swayze's redbones, runnin' full bell on a hot track! Please! Stop! Please help me, mister! Help me! Please, help me! Get outta there! Help me! Help me! That man's scared for his life. Why ain't the driver stoppin'? Runaway's dog-bait for sure. They'll have him heeled 'fore he makes timber again. You watch close now. You watch close. Please! Mister! Halt 'em in before I blow you in two. Whoa! Come on, now. Whoa, now! Whoa! Go ahead. Get in there. Now whip 'em up. Yes, sir! Hold on! That buck's a runaway! Why don't you try and run us down with dogs, you Louisiana chicken-gutters! Ridin' in a stage with a niggra. I understand it don't rub off, colonel. What we gonna do with him, buck? I don't know. We ain't givin' him back to the dogs. Now, look here, boys. We're gonna be comin' to munroe station in a minute. It just happens that the sheriff there is a friend of mine. Why don't you let me turn him over to the sheriff? No! Don't do that! I ran away twice before. The sheriff will sure as hell kill me! The law don't do things like that. Don't worry, boys. My friend will take care of everything. You just simmer down. You ain't got a thing to be afraid of. My god, mister, you don't understand! The sheriff's gonna kill me! Is that right, colonel? Why, he's just scared out of what little wits he's got, that's all. Of course, the sheriff gonna make an example out of him, give him a lick or two. Got to. Otherwise, they'd all run away. But the sheriff'll see he gets back to his rightful owner. Now, that's the law, boys. Ha ha ha! This here buck, he's worth over a thousand dollars. You don't think we gonna let anything happen to that amount of money, do you? Now, don't you worry. You just turn him over to me, and I'll see he gets back to where he belongs. I'm glad to do it. Glad to do it. Plantation's just the other side of munroe. Let me go, mister. I'm rested now. Them dog ain't too close. Maybe I can make it! We got no right to do that, boy. We got to turn you in to the sheriff, just like the colonel said. We got to, boy. I never seen the likes of running down a man with dogs. J“ rock of ages j“ j“ cleft for me j“ j“ let me hide j“ j“ myself in thee j“ we used to sing that song back home. J“ let the water... j“ munroe station sure ain't much. I sure hope that runaway comes out all right. Aw, he'll be all right. Colonel give us his word, didn't he? Sure was scared. Well, he's not nothin' to be scared of now. Come on. Giddyup! Say, what kinda town do you reckon this vicksburg is gonna be, buck? A lot livelier when we get there. Ha. God almighty, buck. Look there. It's him. The runaway slave. He said they'd do it, and they did. Buck, you said... I know what I said. I'll tell the boys. I don't think they'd understand this. We killed him, buck. No, we didn't. We done the right thing, according to the law. Just don't tell 'em. They oughtta know. Just shut up, Miller. So, this is vicksburg? Man, it's really somethin', isn't it? Well, we got until mornin'. No reason why we can't look around. I'll give ya $2.00 each, huh? I hear there's a street down by the river that really lives. They'll eat you up, little bit. I'm a texan. That'll take some eatin'. What you gonna do, buck? Oh, look around. I'll stick with you. I ain't sure how much sinnin' I can do on $200, but I'm willin' to find out. Let's go. Well, where do we start, buck? Well... Well, what happened to you? Oh, we met this fella said he could get us some girls. Took our $2.00 will you shut up. He never come back, huh? No. Ah, we should've known better. You fellas don't look too happy either. Let me tell you something... If a fella ever put one pea under three shells and bet you you can't tell which one it's under, you better believe you can't! I'm beginning to think vicksburg ain't too friendly a place. I saw todo and Willie go into this place across the street. Look at all those soldiers! That's us, little bit. We'll have us some of those fancy uniforms before long. Hey, look at the buckskins on them boys. You reckon the confederacy's that bad off, folks gonna have to go to wearin' hides? Ain't this somethin', buck? It's somethin', all right. I don't like being made sport of. He's just funnin', Miller. You know... These boys should scrape the meat off them skins before they put 'em on. You smellin' up the place. Is that right? Now, we don't want no trouble with soldiers, todo. You tell him, long-hair. I reckon I just did. What can I get for you, boys? Oh, now, honey... You ain't got no milk in here for them young'UN. Yourjob's waitin' on men. Let me go, please. You heard the lady. Let her go. Lady? In here? Now, she may be a female, but she sure ain't no lady. Well, she came to take our order. You can't buy sugar tits in here, boy. Come here, honey. Leave me alone! You heard the lady, mister. Let her be. Well, now. This ol' long-hair. "Let her be," he says. Out, buckskin. You're finally awake. Feeling any better? How'd I get here? I brought you. I, uh, I just figured it would be better than the provost getting you, the way they did your friends. Provost? Yeah. That's our military police. What about my friends? Oh, they got 'em locked up in a stockade. Well... I'd better get 'em out of there. Now... now, you just stay right there. They'll be let out in the morning... In time to catch your stage to Richmond. You sure know an awful lot. Well, I do know how to ask questions. How come you brought me here? You stuck up for me. I... I could hardly leave you just lying there. Besides, you called me lady. That was very nice. I, uh, got some soup here. You want some? Where you from? New Orleans. Your folks there? Hm, step-daddy. But I'm forgettin' him as fast as I can. Your friends tell me you're from west Texas. Yes, ma'am. Is your family there? Well, uh... Indian's got 'em when I was little. I've been on my own ever since. We're kind of alike, then, aren't we? I mean, we're both alone, sort of. Yeah, I guess. Well, uh... I sure wanna thank you for everything you've done. I guess I gotta be goin'. Well, you don't have to go. Oh... yes, I do. You got no place to sleep. Well, I, uh... can't stay here. Well... why not? Well, I mean, uh... No place. My name is Gabrielle. Gabrielle duprey. Um, buck Burnett. Well, yes, I know. You did say I was nice, didn't you? Yes, ma'am. You're nice to me. Well, then let me go on being nice to you, buck. Please? You don't really know me. I know everything I need to know. You're decent, gentle... You don't... you don't know how long it's been since... Since I've met anybody like that. I want you to stay. I want you to stay so very much. It's so much better than an alarm clock. What are you doing down there? You... you sleep kind of all flung out. Hmm. Come on up here. Come on. This was scratchy. Yeah? Hmm. Mmm. That better? Mm-hmm. Your best girl gave this to you? No. You do have a best girl, though, don't you? Nah. West Texas ain't much on girls. Hmm. What there is is all kind of stringy and burnt up. From sun and wind, I bet. Nothin' like you. And all those, uh, Indian squaws... Aren't some of them pretty? And so available, hmm? You sure sound like you know an awful lot. Well... you do know an awful lot. Well, I'm just born a natural. Probably when you find your best girl, you'll... You'll give this to her, huh? I ain't thought much about it. You gotta go to this awful war? Sure. But I'll tell you, I ain't... I ain't so anxious to get there now as I was yesterday. Now... No, no. Don't... Don't start that blubberin'. I better get dressed and round up my ringtails. Think I'd waste my time cryin' over some wild man from Texas? You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? Yep. That's me. Buck, would you mind if I came down to the stage to see you off? No, I'd take real kindly to that. I mean, that'd probably be the last time I see you, I guess. Hey, uh, listen. I, uh... Yes? Uh, nothin'. It's the 8:00 east. You remember that. I'll remember. I'm very good at remembering... If I want to. You look like the tail end of the yankee army. You don't look so sprightly yourself, buck. I don't know. He looks pretty good, considering. Considerin' what? Considerin' that pretty little filly drug you off. Where you been all night? Not that we have to ask. Bet they weren't doin' no square dancin'. Well, never mind. Oh, maybe that wasn't no ordinary filly. Stage gonna leave on time? Yup. Right on time. Well, let's load her up. Come on, move. Buck? I was afraid I was gonna miss you. You pretty near did. I brought you a going-away present. What is this? They're oranges. All the way from Florida. This is the first I ever seen. Oh, I... that's a garter. Something maybe your best girl would give you. Ain't that somethin'. Well, uh, I'll write you when I get to where I'm goin'. I'll write to you. I'll, uh... I'll be coming back, and, uh, if nothing happens, uh, maybe you'll wait. Come on, Texas, if you're comin'. You mean, you... Then... then... Then you won't mind if... If I pretend that I really am your best girl, will you? Well, uh... I reckon I knew that all along. Come on, buck. You're holdin' us up. I'll pray for you. Good-bye. Giddy up there! I'll be back. Them west-Texas ponies, or I'll eat 'em raw! What are them mud-rubbers tryin' to do... scare them to death? No! That ain't the way! What do you think you're doin'? You ain't herdin' chickens out there. You don't handle horses that way. Oh, you double-blue bunch of damn yankee rejects, you! Don't those gray-backs know nothin' about horses at all? They keep that up, they'll chase 'em clear to the next county. Well, we come to help out, and it sure looks like they need it. Come on, Miller. Ha ha ha! That's the way! All right, all you clods with the two left feet, get outta there and let them country boys handle the horses. Oh, boys... We surely are obliged to you all. Oh, nothin' to it. It's just like back home. I'm Mercer Barnes, first sergeant with these here pensacola light blues. This is tellis Yeager. He's a corporal. How do you do, corporal? Pleased to meet you. We're the concho county comanches. On the way to Richmond to join up with general hood's Texas brigade. Richmond, Virginia. Oh, ho ho! Uh... We might be able to make it a little easier for you. Come to the tent. The colonel wants to see you. Eh, he a real colonel? Double registered in stamp. Doggone, we're gonna meet a colonel. Come on. So, you meanin' to sign up? Yes, sir. As soon as we get to Richmond. Maybe I can help. How'd you like to sign up here and now? Kind of return you the favor you did us. Say, that'd be fine. We'd be on army pay from right now, sir? That's what I mean. I reckon' that'd be fine, colonel. We appreciate it. Glad to do it, boys. Face the flag and raise your right hands. All of you say "I do" after this oath. Do each of you solemnly swear to protect the sovereignty and the honor of the confederate states of america now and henceforth with life and limb so help you god? Of the army of the confederacy. Congratulations. Sergeant? Sir! About face! That means turn to your right. That's the way, boys. Forward, march! Well, sergeant, there's the stage, so... I guess you best be fixin' to wave good-bye to it, 'cause you're in the army now... The pensacola light blues. Hyah! Hey, now, wait a minute... Uh-uh. But we're going to Richmond. Virginia. Oh, no, you ain't. First off, you're going to corinth, Mississippi. Than you're going to Tennessee and on up to Shiloh with 20,000 infantry 'cause we're fixin' to shove that there general Grant and them blue-belly soldiers of his plum into lake eerie. Uh, we're not infantry. We're cavalry. Ha, the only cavalry you're gonna see is the south end of them northbound horses. 'Cause colonel boykin needs someone to handle general bragg's remounts, and you're it. Well, just who is this general bragg? General bragg? He is your commanding officer. And he is the meanest, the nastiest, the shortest-tempered human being that you're ever gonna meet up with. Hut! Hut, hut, hut.. Let's get them horses tied down. Sergeant Barnes! Sir! Get those men over here! Yes, sir, general bragg. All right, all you long-hairs. Fall in over here by the general! Come on! Colonel! Why aren't those men in uniform? Hasn't anybody told them anything about military discipline? Sir, they've been busy taking care of your remounts... I don't want excuses. I want them to look and act like soldiers. Yes, sir. Well... Which one of you is the best hand with a horse? Oh, hell's bells, general. We're all half horse. You're gonna be half skinned if you don't start talking like a soldier! You'll learn to say, "yes, sir," and "no, sir," when addressed by an officer... Is that clear? Clear as a pimple on the end of your... Yes, sir. All right. Which man's the best hand with a horse? That'd be our captain, sir. Buck Burnett. Burnett, step out. That's me, general. It's a pleasure to know you. Are you people deliberately trying to antagonize me? Oh, no, sir. All right, Burnett, you stay with me. Colonel, take these men down. See they get outfitted. Wait... you ain't bustin' us up, are you? What did you say?! What I mean, general, is if we could just hunker down and chaw it out some, maybe we could figure this whole thing out. Do you, by any chance, mean talk? Well, yeah, I guess so. What he's trying to say, sir, is... All right, never let it be said that Braxton bragg didn't listen to the voices of his men. Go ahead, soldier. Talk. Well, sir, seein' as how eubie and me and the rest of the boys come all the way from paint rock across on the concho, it sure don't seem right that you're splittin' us up right about when there's some fightin' to be done. Hell, no, general. Just think about it. Us concho county comanches are the damndest yankee killers you ever did see. Bet there ain't a whole troop in the confederate army better than us. You tie that hard and fast to your saddle, general. We come here to fight. Colonel, put this man under arrest. You pick out the best pony and bring him to my tent. Wait a minute! Why's he goin' to arrest me for? I don't reckon he went through the proper channels. No harm done, boys. We'll get you iookin' like soldiers, and you'll feel better. Come along. Follow the colonel, will ya. Come on. Buck! Buck Burnett! Over here! Whoo! Tennessee's got the wettest rain I ever did see! Hi, boys. How are you, little bit? What you been doin'? Oh, shovelin'. How 'bout you? We've been drillin', and right-facin', about-facin' till we're flat fed up with it. Got the chill baloons. Can't shake 'em. He's got a fever, too. We had to come see you. Come on. Buck, this whole thing ain't working out the way we figured. Yeah, we're horse soldiers. They got us scratching gravel. I reckon the army knows best. I think we oughtta get outta here and head for Virginia like we started. We can't do that. That'd be desertion. Anyways, we're movin' up the line tomorrow. I guess we'll get to see enough fightin'. You know, I been thinkin'. I ain't got a damn thing against a yankee. I ain't never seen one. Well, it's just war. We're southerners. We gotta fight. It's a matter of freedom. Whose freedom? Like that slave we took in, buck? Look what happened to him. What happened to him? Never mind, eubie. No, I wanna know. What happened to him? They hung him! They took him into the sheriff, and the sheriff hung him. That the truth, buck? Yeah, I guess it is. That colonel... he lied! That don't make sense. Why'd they do that? I don't know. He ran away to be free. Isn't that what we're here for... to be free? A lot of things just don't make no more sense. They way them folks thew us out of the cotillion in medoda, j.c. Gettin' killed, us busted up and now gettin' ready to go to a battle we don't know anything about... Not even why! Well... I can tell ya it's gonna be a battle. I overheard general bragg and general bauregard arguing as to how we're supposed to move up against the Yankees. You know, bragg lost. When it was over, he come and say to me, "boy, you know any prayers?“ I sa' I ll d, yes, sir" he said, uh... "Say 'em, boy. Say 'em." Man, that's dismal. Hey. Bet you five to one you don't make it. Make it ten to one, buck. You'll make some money. Hey, you know, I just talked to that sergeant Barnes. He says you're just playing sick so you don't have to fight no Yankees tomorrow. Oh, you don't gotta say nothin', buck. It's just you're here. Hey, now, you be quiet, huh? You know, it don't seem right, buck. I mean... we come all this way. I'm dyin' for... Nobody's dyin'. Hey, uh, you know what I'm doin'? I'm takin' care of one broken down plug. You know that old bay the general rides? Ain't that a laugh? Well, all I gotta do is just keep him saddled up and ready as a tent. Ain't that a way to fight a war? You slack off, buck. You ain't foolin' nobody. You just sit there, huh? Take it easy, bit. Buck?! The candle's out. Now, gentlemen. Mark well the hour. Will you listen to that. Sir. You tell general Johnson word for word that I have hit sherman and I'm driving them back toward the river. But there's an opening in my right flank, and I want it closed. You got that? Yes, sir. Howdy, buck. Oh, todo. What you go and do? Hell of a mess; Ain't it, buck? Everything just... Just came apart. Well, uh... Better not talk. Got some water, buck? Yeah. I'll get it, todo. Miller! Miller. Buck! Well, Texas! You made it this far. Hey, I thought you was a runner. Where's your horse? Got killed back here. I gotta get through to general Johnson. Oh, you ain't heard. Johnson's dead. He caught a yankee miniball. That's a fact. I heard bauregard's taken over command. Well, soon as I get a horse, I better hightail it back to bragg. I don't hardly reckon you can do that, neither. Sherman done bust it through on the left. There's a couple yankee regiments 'tween us and bragg. Why don't you come along with us, buck? Um, might as well. Where you goin'? I'll tell you we'll go on down this road and through them trees. There's Yankees on the other side. Miller, uh... Todo's dead. I saw him get it. Hoped he'd make it through. Here you go, Texas. Everything you need for squirrel shootin'. All right, let's move out. Come on. How 'bout the rest of them? Well, we ain't done so good, buck. This war ain't workin' out the way I thought. Willie bill got a miniball right between the eyes. Eubie? Well, the Yankees were shellin' us something awful. One of them mortars and a big gun ball blew up right on us, and eubie just wasn't there no more. Oh, damn. Sure ain't nothin' like I thought it'd be. Listen, there's Yankees on the other side of this Ridge, and we're gonna get 'em. You best fasten on your pig stickers. I figured them Yankees would take one look at us and run. Hmm. They ain't about to. They don't give up easy. Well, I don't understand it. We're fightin' for the south. They invaded us. What they got to fight about? Whatever it is, they're sold on it. All right. Let's go! Hey, Texas! Texas! It's me, Texas. Mercer Barnes. What happened? Oh, the company got shot up all over the place. I've been trying to round up what's left of them. How long you all been in here? I don't know. I was runnin', and everything blew up. Miller? Miller, that you? That ain't Miller. We got a yank in here? Texas, there's an old sayin' amongst soldiers. When the miniballs is flyin' and the artillery's hotter than hell, there ain't no such thing as an enemy. Besides, he was in here first. Don't hardly seem neighborly to throw him out now. Hi, reb. Hello. He's feelin' kinda poorly. Caught one in the belly. Yeah, more than likely. Bad enough he's bleedin' to death. No sense he gotta get pneumonia, too. Well, I surely wouldn't know where we could go. There's an old church up the road. You fellas give me a hand, I'd guide you. What do you think? Well, it would beat drownin', I reckon. Yeah, come on. Let's go. Gimme your hand, yank. Come on. Come on, Texas. I got a gun here that says you better put that light out. And shut that door! Why no light? Because old bragg's got his damned provost out hunting down them that strayed from the fightin'. Guess he figures too many of us is gettin' lost deliberately. This ain't good. We don't wanna get caught with these here stragglers. Old bragg... he's shoot us first, and then ask the questions. He's shoot me sure. I'm awol. I better get back. No, I reckon he figures you're dead. That ain't no never mind. I ain't, and I was a runner. Buck! You made it! I thought sure you'd stopped a miniball. It found me whole. I got a friend here who's goin' fast. He could purely use some scripture readin'. Anybody know any? My father's a preacher up in Boston. Boys, we got a blue-belly in with us. I don't know what color his belly is, but it's bleeding red now. He's gut-shot. Let the yankee read. Reckon it's the same Bible. Come on, boy. Somebody... make a light. I... I dearly wanna look at his face. Bragg's provost will see the light. The hell with bragg's provost. My friend's dyin'. Somebody light up! "He opened his mouth and talked to them, saying," "blessed are the poor in spirit," "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted." "Blessed are the meek," "for they shall inherit the earth." "Blessed are the peacemakers," “for they shall be called children of god." "Love thy enemies." "Bless them that curse you." "Do good unto them that hate you.“ "and pray for them which despitefully use you" "and persecute you." "The lord is my Shepherd." “I shall not want." "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures." “He ieadeth me beside the still waters.“ "he restoreth my soul." Buck, somebody's out there. Come on. Everybody put up your hands! You're all under arrest! All right, boys. Move out. Come on, get out! Come on! You all right? Come on, we gotta get outta here! Come on! I'm sorry, Texas. I gotta help him. You gotta help yourself! Miller? Ain't nothin' you can do! Anyway, them provost would kill you 'fore you got anyplace close to him. You can't hardly move with that arm of yours. Now, listen to me. Old bragg is too busy with troubles of his own to have him shot right away. Maybe we can do something later on. All right, Mercer. All right. I ain't letting bragg or god almighty shoot my friend. You hear that, Mercer? Mr. Burnett, what do you think you're doing? Oh, uh... I... I sure wanna thank you for everything you've done, bein' so nice and all. I just gotta be gettin' outta here. Oh, but the doctor didn't say you could go. I reckon he's got more important things on his mind. Anyhow, I know more about how good I feel than he does. Uh, ma'am, is, uh... General bragg's provost office here in town? At the railroad station. But you shouldn't go. Well, I reckon' if I don't get word to general bragg that I'm all right, well, he just won't sleep nights. Anyway... I gotta see about a friend of mine. Well, I guess I can't stop you. When you see Gabrielle, give her my regards. How come you know about her? After they took your arm off, when you were delirious, well, she's all you talked about. Hmm. Is she a nice girl? Oh, uh, yes, ma'am. Mighty nice. Thank you. Buck! Hey, Texas! I know'd you'd be one of the lucky ones! One hell of a lucky boy. What are you doing on provost duty? Well, the light blues got so busted up, there wasn't enough of us left to even stand roll. They sent old tellis and me down here. How ya been? Oh, fit as pie. Short one wing, but I can manage. Well, I figured that night at the church you was likely to lose it... I'm sorry. Oh, I'm still here. Kind of a shame that the only time you was wounded had to be by a southern bullet. Kind of a friendly wound that way. Say, seein' as how you're on provost duty, maybe you can tell me what's happened to Miller. Uh... I got me a detachment to take care of. You tell him, tellis. Uh... tell me what? Buck, I'd rather be in your shape than Miller's. He escaped. Had him chained up on a working party. Don't know exactly what happened, but he swung that chain, laid out his guard, and took off. The only thing is... He split that guard's head wide open. He killed him, buck. Oh, no. General bragg put out special orders on him. Get him dead or alive... Just as soon dead. Well, they won't catch old Miller. He'll run like a jackrabbit. Well, not no more he don't. A cracker named youngerford says a tall fellow like Miller tried to hide in his barn. Says he put a bullet into him. Appears he's still in the barn. Mercers are fixin' to go get him now. Man do a thing like that... Shoot him? Lotta no-account crackers. They been makin' a business turnin' boys over to the provost. Where you say this place is at? Youngerford's. It's, uh, ten miles out. We'll get him. Yeah, I reckon. That's a mighty fine horse. That... that yours, tellis? No. It's Mercer's. And it stays there, in case you got any ideas. I'm a friend of yours. Well, yeah... But you texans is a wild bunch. Well, now. Hey, now, ain't that colonel boykin? I thought he was dead. Where? Hey, you! Hey, there, buck! Come back here, buck! Come back here! He got your horse, Mercer! Oh, there's lots more horses. Oh, damn, damn, damn it all! Now there's two of 'em I gotta get. Miller? Buck? Buck? You, uh... Hit bad? Yeah. Pretty bad. In the belly? That's where it came out. I was kinda hopin' you'd come. We're gettin' outta here. We're goin' to Texas. No... I can't move, buck. I'm all froze up and dried out inside. Likely to kill me, at first. Now it don't hardly hurt at all. Oh, we'll make it. You'll make it. It's only two days to the big river. You go on back to Texas. You ain't a captain no more. You gotta go. You go back to vicksburg, pick up that girl. Buck... Huh? I hit that guard pretty hard. Did I hurt him bad? You killed him, Miller. I didn't mean to. I know, Miller. They said they was gonna shoot me. Now, what did I do to get shot for? I don't know. I don't know nothin' about this damned war. Todo... Eubie... Little bit, Willie bill, j.C... They're all dead. Shh... We didn't make much of a splash, now, did we? That pretty girl in mendota... She said we was southern patriots. Remember when we kissed her hand? Yeah... I remember. Now, wasn't that somethin'? We sure done some iivin', ain't we, buck? Oh, we're gonna do a whole lot more. Somebody's outside. Provost is after me. No. Ain't nobody. You better get goin' now, buck. I ain't gonna be here for long now. Miller? You wanna pray? I already done my praying. I'm glad you're with me. You and Miller come with your hands up! We got this place surrounded! We gettin' outta here! Please! Please! God, buck. Don't move me. Oh, Miller. I'll get you outta here, Miller. I'll cover you from up here, Miller. They ain't gonna get you. I promise. Buck, this is the last time I'm gonna ask you! Sergeant Barnes? Sir. What are you doing here? There's a couple of deserters in the barn, sir. Well, drag 'em out and shoot 'em. Uh, yes, sir. One of them's one of them Texas boys... was your horse orderly. That buck Burnett, sir. He's in there? A deserter? Yes, sir. He was in the hospital, though, sir. And, uh, well... Yeah, I reckon you gotta call him a deserter. He... he stole a horse and come out here iookin' for his friend corporal nalls... The one that killed the guard. Let's get him outta there. Barnes? It's nalls, general. He's dead. Where's the other one? He's gotta be in here some place. That's my horse he stole, tied up outside. Uh, with the general's permission, sir, the way I heard it, it was seven of them come out all the way from west Texas to join up. Nobody made them. Just boys, they was. Well... Well, this Burnett... He's the last one of them left alive! Seems kind of a shame to hunt down the last one. One of them oughtta get back to Texas! He stole a horse and deserted! In my army, we shoot men for that. Yeah, I know. It just seems a shame. I... I know'd all of them boys. There's no room for sentiment in the army. No... I reckon there ain't. Discipline is discipline. A soldier obeys orders or suffers for it. Is that clear? That's clear, general. Sergeant! Where the hell are you going?! I'm goin' up there and dig him out. A man would be a fool to hide in the hayloft. Why, that boy's half way to Texas by now. But my horse is still tied up outside. Are you arguing with me, sergeant? No, sir. All right. Get that man's body on the wagon, and let's get out of here. We got too much to do to waste time runnin' down one Texas straggler. Yes, sir, general! Sergeant! Are you trying to aggravate me? What are you doing?! I was just fixin' to take my horse along, sir. Leave that horse. Send a detail out to pick up that horse in the morning. Yes, sir. Course, with all these stragglers around, I'd be willing to bet that horse won't be here in the morning. Just follow orders, sergeant. Yes, sir. As a matter of fact, I'd be willing to say that horse is gone while we're a mile down the road! Move your men out! Giddyup!
