Then dog started chasing my mom like the Hounds of Hell in Vampires Everywhere. We've been aware of some serious vampire activity in this town for a long time . Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead. As a matter of fact, we're almost certain. .. . ..that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall. Kill your brother. You'll feel better. Look, guys, my brother is not a bloodsucker. Look, it says here that if you kill the head vampire. . . . ..all half-vampires will return to normal. Gluys, if my brother's a vampire, believe me, he's only half. Does your brother know who the head vampire is? No, l don't think so. Then you'll have to kill him. And if you don't. . . . ..then we will. This all started when my mom went to work at Max's video store. Max never comes in till after it's dark. The dog who chased my mom this morning was his. And listen to this: "Vampires require a daytime protector, a guardian. . . . ..to watch over them as they sleep. Fierce dogs, the Hounds of Hell, are often employed for this purpose." No shit. Yeah? Well, what happens if my mom is dating the head vampire? You guys could nail him and save Santa Carla. Truth, justice, the American way triumphs. Thanks to you two. We'll check out Max. Sam. Hey! Smells good. When do we eat? l told Max 8:00 . Max? Are we gonna have company again? Again? Dad, you haven't had company in this house. . . . ..since Mom died eight years ago. Right.

Well, you're the man of the house. . . . ..and I'm not coming in until you invite me. You're invited. Thanks very much. -Hello. -Oh, hi. I didn't hear you come in. ls it all right for the guest to see the food before dinner? You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding. Oh, yeah, l always get those confused. -Thorn sends his apologies. -Oh, well, tell him l'm walking again. [BOTH LAUGHlNGl] He promises to behave if you come back. Oh, well, that's so sweet. SAM: Mom? These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan, the Frog brothers. Oh, I didn't know you were having guests. Mom, if we're in your way, we can go eat some peanut butter in the kitchen. No, there's plenty for everybody. Max, this is my son Sam, and Edgar and Alan Frog? BOTH: Mm-hm. -Lucy, this looks terrific. -l hope it tastes good. Mmm. It tastes wonderful. Mmm!

No. lt's not cheese, it's garlic. -You hate garlic, don't you? -No, l like garlic. lt's just a little much. lt's raw garlic. Glarlic? How did that happen? Gluys, he likes garlic. LUCY: Sorry. Here . Quick, drink some water. -Hey, wait a minute! LUCY: Oh! Sam, what's the matter with you? -Does it burn? -Burn? What are you, nuts? lt's freezing. LUCY: Oh, look at your suit, Max.

Sam, what has gotten into you tonight? l think l know what's going on here. -You do? MAX: Yeah. l know what you're thinking, Sam, but you're wrong. -l am? -Yeah. l'm not trying to replace your father. Or steal your mother away from you. l would just like to be your friend, that's all. Glood night, Lucy. -Thanks a lot. -l'm sorry, Mom. LUCY: Max, I'm so sorry. l mean, nothing like this has ever happened. Major mistake. Our batting average isn't terrific, is it? 0 for 2. You were so sweet to him just now. l don't know what got into him. He's not like that. Well, kids Sam's age need discipline, otherwise they run all over you. He doesn't run over me.

That wasn't wine they gave me to drink. lt was blood. That was David's blood. You drank someone's blood? Are you crazy? l'm just like DaÎ½id now, Star. No, you're not. You're like Laddie and me. -We're not one of them-- -Until you make your first kill. Why didn't you kill me last night? You were supposed to be my first. That's what David wanted. -But l couldn't, Michael. -Why? -Because you care so much about me? -Yes, l do. What are you doing here? What do you want from me? l wanted to tell you that it's not too late for you. But for me it gets harder and harder to resist. l'm weak. Why did you come here tonight, Star? l was hoping you'd help Laddie and me. [CHUCKLINGl] [WIND HOWLS] Star! Don't kill anybody until we get back to you. MlCHAEL: What are you doing? -l've got connections. [BlCYCLE BELL RlNGlS] Okay. Where's Nosferatu? -Who? -The Prince of Darkness. -The night crawler. The bloodsucker. -El Vampiro. Mike, they're here! [TlRES SCREECHlNGl] Hey, Glrandpa, is it okay if we borrow your car? Weapons check. -l don't want you going down there. -l'm going. This isn't a comic book, Sammy. These guys are brutal killers. So are the Frog brothers. EDGAR: Check me. Who would you rather go down there with you? Them or me? lf something happens, l'm not gonna have the strength to protect you. Well, this time I'll protect you, bud. Even though you're a Î½ampire, you're still my brother. Listen, just so you know. . . . ..if you try to stop us or vamp out in any way.. . . ..then I'll stake you without even thinking twice about it. Chill out, Edgar. Yeah. Come on. Where did you say you met these guys? EDGAR: Holy shit. ALAN: Vampire hotel. Here's one. Come on, let's stake her, man. Don't you touch her! You stay away from her! EDGAR: Come on. Vampires have such rotten tempers. Star. The rest of them haÎ½e gotta be around here someplace. Let's find them. -There must be something in the corner. MlCHAEL: Star. EDGAR: Look up there , man. You gotta look everywhere. -l'm taking you out of here . -No, take Laddie first. Please . l feel a draft. l think there's something up here. EDGAR: Let's check it out, Sam. ALAN: Come on. EDGAR: Let's go. l'll be right back, Mike! l hope. EDGAR: Come on, Sam, let's go! Move, Alan! Move! [FLIES BUZZlNGl] ALAN: Ah. Ugh. Ugh. -Flies. EDGAR: We're on the right trail. Flies and the undead go together, like bullets and guns. Come on. [SNIFFING] What's that smell? Vampires, my friend. Vampires. [ALL COUGlHlNGl] EDGAR: Come on. SAM: lt's freezing in here. Ah! lt looks like a dead end. Let's head back. They must have hidden the coffins around here someplace. SAM: There's nothing here. Let's go, guys. -Jesus! -Aah! [SAM YELLlNGl] l thought they were supposed to be in coffins. That's what this cave is. lt's one giant coffin. Right now they're at their most Î½ulnerable. ALAN: Easy pickings. Remember, you have to kill the leader. EDGAR: We don't know which one the leader is. l guess we'll just have to kill them all. Let's start with the little one. First come, first staked. What was that, a little vampire humor? lt wasn't funny. Oh, my God. No! Don't even. Glood night, bloodsucker. SAM: No! [SCREAMINGl] [ALL SCREAMlNGl] You're dead meat! ALAN: Let's get out of here! Let's go! [ROARlNGl] SAM: Glo! Get out of here! Run! Glo! Fast! Come on! [SAM SCREAMlNG] EDGAR: Glrab him! Glet him into the light! EDGAR: Glet him into the sun! Glet him into the sunlight! [SCREAMINGl] Tonight. SAM: Mike, start the car! Mike! Mike! Start the car. Mike. Mike. -We blew it, man. We lost it. -Shut up. We unraveled in the face of the enemy. They pulled a mind-scramble on us. -They opened their eyes and talked. -l'll drive. -We don't ride with vampires. -Fine. Stay here. -We do now. -Yeah. [ENGlNE STARTS] EDGAR: Come on! Sam, let's get out of here. Burn rubber. [ALL SCREAMlNGl] [TlRES SCREECH] Christ! Burn rubber does not mean warp speed. [NANOOK BARKlNGl] Cool it, Nanook. -Your dog knows a flesh-eater. -Take him outside, Sam. Come on, Nanook. Michael. Do you know the rule about filling up the car with gas. .. . ..when you take it without asking? No, Glrandpa. Well, now you do. -We definitely blew Plan A. -Time to activate Plan B. SAM: What's Plan B? -We don't have one. We only have two and a half hours. SAM: Why? The sun will go down. They'll be looking for us. Mom. This is-- What are you doing with the bike? l gotta tell you something. lt's real important. Shh. -Santa Carla is crawling with vampires. -Excuse me. Mom, l'm serious. Listen, Edgar staked one. lt was screaming and fizzing. Look, there's evidence on my sweater. -Mom, you gotta tell someone. LUCY: Come on, honey. -You gotta tell someone. -This isn't funny. l'm not kidding. They're coming as soon as it gets dark. Stop it. Right now. Just stop it. -Mom-- -No, not another word. l don't believe you're doing this. l'm gonna see Max and you're trying to ruin it. No, l'm not. There's nothing wrong with Max. Why don't you want me to see--? l'm not talking about Max, all right? To hell with Max. l'll deal with you later, young man. -Mom. -No. SAM: Gluys, we're on our own. Glood. That's just the way we like it. [BlCYCLE BELL RlNGlS] [SPEAKlNGl lNDlSTlNCTLY] Glrandpa? The Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up at 7 instead of 8, okay? We got a date tonight? l guess so. She said not to be late. Well, l better get cleaned up, then. [HORN HONKS "LA CUCARACHA" OFF-KEY] EDGAR: Glo, let's go, come on. Die, Mr. Vampire. Glo, come on, come on. Let's move. They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they? They'll be coming for all of us. -Laddie, wake up. LADDlE: Hm? [PEOPLE SCREAMlNGl] [YELLS] [HIGlH-PlTCHED SCREECHlNGl] MAX: It's okay? Thank you. LUCY: Oh, it's delicious. [BARKlNGl] Oh! Thorn, stop that. [THORN GlROWLlNGl] [LUCY LAUGlHS] What's the matter, Lucy? Oh, just old memories coming back. No, seriously. Why are you so jumpy tonight? No, well, it's something Sam-- He came into the store, and-- You know, it was just a kid's imagination, l'm sure, but. . . . ..he seemed so sincere, but-- -lt's insane. -Tell me. l promise not to laugh. Honest. [NANOOK WHIMPERING] EDGAR: l think l should warn you all. When a vampire buys it, it's never a pretty sight. No two bloodsuckers go out the same way. Some yell and scream. Some go quietly. Some explode. Some implode. But all will try to take you with them. [HIGlH-PlTCHED SCREECHlNGl] [BARKlNGl] -Nanook. l left him outside . EDGAR: Don't go out there. Stop him. MlCHAEL: Sam! EDGAR: Sam, stop. Sam, come back. ALAN: No, wait. -Sam. Come back. -Sam. Sam, you're in danger, man. SAM: Nanook. Come on. STAR: Michael! ALAN: Come on, come back! STAR: No. ALAN: Come on back. EDGAR: Michael, get back, man. -Mike. STAR: Hurry! Michael, hurry! Hurry, Michael. Michael, they're coming! Come on, hurry! [HIGlH-PlTCHED SCREECHlNGl] Hurry up, man! [ALL SHOUTlNG] Come on, come on. They're coming now! Take them upstairs! Glo. Come on, move it, moÎ½e it. [DWAYNE YELLS] [LAUGlHINGl] -l say we terminate them right now. -Laddie, run! -Hey! ALAN: Aah! [PAUL LAUGHS] You're mine! -You killed Marko! -Yeah. You're next. No. You're next. Glarlic don't work, boys. Try the holy water, dead breath! [SCREAMINGl] [BOTH SCREAMlNGl] [NANOOK BARKlNGl] [SCREAMINGl] [ROARS] [BOTH SCREAMlNGl] Oh, my God. Oh, my Glod. Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike. Mike, wake up. [SAM SCREAMlNG] [DWAYNE LAUGlHlNGl] [SCREAMS] [DWAYNE GlROANlNG] [CHUCKLINGl] -You missed, sucker. -Only once, pal. [SCREECHlNGl] [lNXS & JlMMY BARNES' "GlOOD TlMES" PLAYlNG ON STEREO] [SCREAMINGl] [MUSlC STOPS] Death by stereo. Come on. [WATER RUNNINGl] What the hell? Come on. [YELLS] [LAUGlHINGl] [HIGlH-PlTCHED SCREECHlNGl] [ALAN YELLS] -Hey, hey, shh. It's me, it's me. -Are you okay? l nailed one of them with a bow and arrow. All right, Sam-o. We trashed the one that looks like Twisted Sister. We totally annihilated his night-stalking ass. Well, Nanook helped a little. SAM: All right, Nanook. EDGAR: Death to all vampires. Maximum body count. We are awesome monster-bashers. -The meanest. -The baddest. [ALL SCREAMlNGl] [GlROWLINGl] Holy shit! It's the attack of Eddie Munster. Glet him. Stop! Glet away from him. You just stay away from him. He's just a little boy. [GlROWLINGl] [DAVlD YELLS] [DAVlD LAUGlHS] You afraid to face me , David? Huh? Come on. DAVlD: l tried to make you immortal. You tried to make me a killer! [DAVlD LAUGlHlNGl] You are a killer. [HISSES] [BOTH GlRUNTINGl] My turn. [HIGlH-PlTCHED SCREECHlNGl] Stop fighting me, Michael. l don't want to kill you. Join us. Never. lt's too late. My blood is in your veins. So is mine! [BOTH YELLlNGl] [SCREAMINGl] No! Michael! [GlASPS] SAM: Mike! MlCHAEL: Don't let them see me like this. -Michael. Yeah. MlCHAEL: Glet away, Sam. -Mike, what's wrong? MlCHAEL: l said, get away! What's the big deal? You destroyed the head vampire. -lt's all over. MlCHAEL: Nothing's changed. He's right. l don't feel any different. Then there's still one more. LUCY: Sam? Michael? l'll handle Mom. Come on, go. Don't let her see the bodies. -Sam? Michael? SAM: Mom? -What is going on? -What's happened? -We have to have a heavy conversation. -Where's Michael? -What happened to your face? -l think I can explain what's going on. Remember the food fight Michael and l got into last year? EDGAR: This has nothing to do with the food fight. l think I should cover this. SAM: I think you should sit down. LUCY: What happened to your face? [FOOTSTEPS] l don't want to hear another word from you until l talk to Michael. MAX: l'm sorry, Lucy. This is all my fault. David and my boys misbehaved. l told you, boys need a mother. Max, what are you talking about? l knew it. You're the head vampire. Sam, don't start this again. You're the secret that David was protecting. Mm-hm. -Who's this? -But you passed the test. Don't ever invite a vampire into your house, you silly boy. lt renders you powerless. -Did you know that? -Of course. Everyone knows that. Has everyone gone crazy here? What's the matter with all of you? lt was you l was after all along, Lucy. What? l knew that if l could get Sam and Michael into the family. . . . ..there's no way you could say no. Where's Michael? lt was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. [SCREAMINGl lN DISTANCE] Just like one big happy family. Your boys. . . . ..and my boys. Glreat. The bloodsucking Brady Bunch. But I still want you, Lucy. [ALL SCREAM] [STAR GASPS] l haven't changed my mind about that. l didn't invite you this time, Max. Michael. [LAUGlHS] LUCY: Michael, no! [BOTH YELLlNGl] [LUCY SCREAMS] Michael. [YELLS] [ALL YELLlNGl] -Don't you touch my mother. -Sam, don't! SAM: Ah! Ow. Damn it. Don't fight, Lucy. lt's so much better if you don't fight. Mom! Mom, don't! Mom. Don't do it, Mom. Mom, don't do it. -Sam-- SAM: Mom, no. -Mom, no! Mom! LUCY: Sam! SAM: Mom! [HORN HONKS "LA CUCARACHA" OFF-KEY] [CHOKlNGl AND GlROANING] [MAX SCREAMlNG] [ALL COUGlHlNGl] [MAX GlROWLlNGl] [GlROWLINGl STOPS] Jesus. LUCY: Are you okay? -Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah, right. -Yeah. We kicked their ass, man. lt's over. Star! Star! Laddie. [NANOOK BARKlNGl] ls eÎ½erybody okay? Oh, Michael. STAR: Are you okay? LADDlE: Yes. -Oh, Michael. STAR: I was so scared. LUCY: Oh, my boys. How much do you think we should charge them for this? Dad. Dad? Dad, are you all right? The one thing about living in Santa Carla l never could stomach: All the damn vampires.
