Hello. Come in. How are you? - Hello, Uncle Vano. - Hello, Soso. Hang up, you're interfering! Hello? Connect me to Kutaisi! - Wait, Soso, he's busy. - Who is in there? Vaso and the man who's so interested in cracks. Wait, they'll be out soon. Hello? Give me Kutaisi! Did he like it? - ''Blue Mountains'' and what else?.. - ''Tien Shan''. - He forgot it at the bank. - How could he? He forgot it on a windowsill. He got so upset. He asked you to give him another copy. Where can l get it? Hang up, Miss! Soso, go and bring another copy. That was the last copy. We don't have such a position. l'll be frank with you, Kuparadze's call did play its role. Otherwise l don't think l would have been able to do anything. Our staff is inflated, as everywhere else, you know. We'll have to take you on as a freelancer. Dear Vaso, have the comrade acquainted with our specifics, let him familiarize himself with the collective. He has already familiarized himself. Very well. lt was nice meeting you. Likewise. Thank you. You don't go. - May l? - Come in. Dear Vaso, who called us about this man? - Kuparadze. - Ah, yes, l remember. Kuparadze. About that picture... Everything will be all right with the picture. We'll solve that problem. Grisha is here. Misha is here. Gosh, l meant Otar, not Misha. - l'm begging you. - What am l here for? Oh, God... l can't wait till lrodion goes on leave. The director must read it as soon as possible. All right, but you'll be responsible. ls it difficult to open it? No, it's not. lt doesn't close anyway. lrodion is here to guard the safe, he's got nothing else to do. There are parallel cracks in rooms 4, 5, 16, in the paper and drying shops. There have been instances of plaster crumbling. ln rooms 6, 8 and 13, there're perpendicular cracks. - Who is Kuparadze? - Kuparadze? l don't know. This is a report to the higher bodies of power. And this is a copy to the Chairman of the City Motoball Association. Let's call that motoball here and set up a commission. For how long can we talk to them by correspondence? Our building is shock-resistant! We've been in the demolition zone for a long time! They are not giving us money for major repairs. A breakdown in the deficit, they say. What has a breakdown to do with it? No one's going to lift a finger until the ceiling falls down on us. - What date is today? - The 9th of April. You see? Have a seat. Did you find it? lt's got sodden from rain and snow. How could rain get here? Kote, is Khaburizania back from Tsikhisdziri? No. lf he shows up, take his copy from him, lock it in Gomelauri's drawer, and give the keys to Tina. All right. Give me those pages, l'll have them ironed in the drying shop. lt won't work. We'll have to type a new copy. You were told to take the picture out! No one told me to take it out, they told me to look into the matter. We looked into it, but Murmanidze didn't sign a draft resolution. Why?! Will you tell me, for God's sake? They told me to strengthen the hook. l demand that it be taken out! lf you're afraid, dear Vaso, move your table or move yourself to another room. Where am l supposed to move? l've been sitting in this place for 26 years. Can you understand it? Speaking. No, you've got a wrong number. lt's 83, not 82. lt's a matter of principle, if you wish! Take the picture out! - Put the manuscript down! - Yes. l'm not afraid of either God or devil! We know you'd been a tank man. But it has to be cleared up. - Look into your own soul! - What are you driving at? Where's Alyosha Devdariani's archive? Where are the manuscripts and photos? They've been removed. By the proper authorities. l won't tolerate your insinuations! My services have been recorded. What services? l've got citations... five of them! l'm going upstairs! Go wherever you like. - And tell them where the archive is. - l will. - l'm going there now! - Go, go. Hello. Don't stand up. - Who's in there? - Simon Menabde. He told me not to let anyone in. Don't leave yet. The meeting will take place, but later. - That's what he said. What can l do? - l see. lrodion, are you back from your vacation? l've never left. They won't let me. - Have a cigarette? - Please. Want to try mine? - How are you? - lt's headaches and rocking. l can't even put hairpins in. lt's blood pressure. l'm being rocked like on a ship. Why on a ship? Sometimes the earth is rocked too. - That's right. - Will there be a bonus, Aunt Tamara? l don't know. - What about the salary? - No. And the holiday pay? The director said not to give it yet. Has he signed the payroll sheet? - Are you all right? - Oh God, l've been rocked again. How were you rocked? Sideways or from down up? God only knows. Please stretch your arms, spread your fingers. Don't be afraid. Leave me alone. What do you want from me? Who are you? Leave her alone. lt will take too long to rewrite it. And your handwriting is illegible. Let me help you. - l don't wish to trouble you. - lt's no trouble at all. - What about the meeting? - They can do without me. All right. Look here. Am l being too familiar with you? We've been familiar for a long time. Then rewrite it starting from this page to page 52. Got it. Fine, this will not do any more. Neither will this. This goes to the wastebasket, too. These violets. l brought them for you. Your cap. We'll get it approved now, and you can begin inspection. Vazha Zazayevich is busy. - Who is in there? - Simon Menabde. Aunt Tamara, don't start paying salaries before he leaves. What about my holiday pay? Were that your trousers that burst? No, no, the seams are intact. lt was a false alarm. Strange... lt was a very unusual sound. The ceiling has cracked. The ceiling has cracked! Strange... Yesterday it was like new. Why are you all staring at the ceiling? Hello, Otar. Hello. Sign this document, please. Grisha, you sign it, too. Where's Soso? Oh, you're here. Well, are you still writing? Go on, the director's waiting. How is life? - This is for you. - Thank you. - And this is for you. - Thank you. l'm in conference. l'll call you back. Soso, did they tell you that l forgot your ''Blue Mountains'' at the bank? How could l, l can't understand it. Don't worry, l'll go and pick it up. What's happening to me, l can't understand? Well, has everybody read it? What kind of a man are you, Soso? You should stir people up, push them, disturb them, incite them. Yes? l see. l'll be there in an hour. Yes, all right. They want me again. Tina, do you hear me? The meeting will be tomorrow at 1 1 . Got it. The meeting will be tomorrow. At 1 1 sharp everybody must be here. You'll have to wait. As soon as Soso is out, you'll go in. l'll call you. Don't forget to call Vakhtang. What is it you've brought me? l'm not speaking to you. Yes, l got it. On five stands? Two titles again? lt's not to you again. l think five stands will be enough. Just a minute. Yes? Wait a minute, l'm discussing an important matter. Excuse me. There will be no problem with transportation? What an awful handwriting you have. Sorry, it's not to you again. Just a minute, don't hang up. Call the ''lntourist'' and make all the arrangements. l'll be there in an hour. All right, l got it. Yes. Are we taking wives? All right, l'll be there at four. What have you brought me? The same thing, ''Blue Mountains'' again. Partly written by hand, partly typed. - Can you read it? - Of course. - Can you make it out? - Why not? lt's bold type, and your handwriting is quite legible. Did you feel anything? No, nothing. lt must be my blood pressure. Yesterday l couldn't slip away again. Banquets, farewells, meetings... lt's not polite not to go. You go, and you get this result. - You didn't feel it again? - No. lt's strange. So it's high blood pressure again. l shouldn't have gone to that banquet yesterday. That motoball will kill us. lf we don't drive them out, they'll topple the ceiling on our heads. Now it's not so bad. But what will it be like when the hot weather sets in? We won't be able to open windows. Now l will read it for sure. But what do you need two titles for? What a handwriting! Can anyone make it out? Did you keep it in the water or what? Vazha Zazayevich, may l come in? - Yes, come in. - Please. Please meet the chief commissar of the City Motoball Association, the captain of our city team, Comrade Artyom Chachanidze. - Very pleased to meet you. - So am l. Where shall we begin? With the 18th. - Follow us. - Give me a hand. - Where's Shota? - On a sabbatical leave. When he's back, l want to see him. And Mitradze? He's at a seminar in Pitsunda. All right. Look, one lengthwise and three crosswise cracks. Let's begin. Step on the gas. - Where to now? - Let's see this room. Look at the plan. - Come on. - Step on it. This is our new employee. - Very nice. What's your name? - Bella. Sit down. Vaso, we've already seen each other. Hello again. - Working already? - Yes. - Got acclimated? - Entirely. Good. He should be fully occupied. Soso, give him a copy. The room is in a state of emergency. Look how many cracks there are. And another one there. Comrade Chachanidze, please note to what state you motor vibrations have reduced the ceilings in the rooms you've just inspected. And that's not all. Plaster from the ceiling in this corner is continuously crumbling. l can't work because of this picture. We'll get it reinforced for good! You were supposed to take it out! Here, Otar has signed it. - ls this my resolution? - Don't recognize your own signature? But Murmanidze didn't sign it. We've already solved that problem. Let's put an end to it. l'll do as you say. Here. Let's go on. Step on it. Hello. How are you, Vazha Zazayevich. How are you feeling? My headaches are killing me. l've lost three kilos. And l'm being rocked from side to side. This is because of cigarettes. You must quit. Nothing is crumbling down here? No, nothing seems to crumble down. But we're rocked from time to time. There, l've been rocked again. Give me your hands, please. How were you rocked, from the side or, pardon me, from the bottom? Tell me, it's very important. From what side? - Let go of my hands! - Tell me! From the bottom. The motorcycles and street noises have nothing to do with it. Didn't l tell you? These are underground vibrations. They blow up rocks. So you weren't imagining it. l'm still in my right mind. l told you l was rocked. Couldn't that man be spying on us? What did you say they blow up? Shall l give this information here, or maybe téte-a-téte in your office? l would appreciate if you read it. My friends say it's not bad. But your experienced eye is quite another matter. l won't bear a grudge if anything. Will you read it? We'll read it and discuss it. Artyom Chachanidze. Lyric poems. Wonderful. Soso, read it carefully and show it to the members of the editorial board. You can go now. The experiment is over, everybody come to my office. They are mostly love poems. Dear Shukri, excuse me. Vazha Zazayevich asked you to read it and show it to the board members. And inform him of your opinion as soon as possible. Low-charge explosions of rocks are under way now in this district. Possibly it's the subway or the construction of an underground artel. l haven't been able to establish that yet. How do you know that? lt's my specialty. l'm a mining engineer. You said you were a mine surveyor. A mining engineer and a mine surveyor are the same thing. Those double names are going to drive me crazy. l told you how badly we needed a mine surveyor. We ought to have gotten ourselves two or three good mine surveyors sooner. - What day is today? - Friday. Good. Where's that Chachanidze? Where's he? Has he left already? Yes, he has. Who said it was motorcycles' vibration? - l didn't say that. - Who was it? Soso, you have to help us. A very important mission for you. Please, go down in the subway and find out how dangerous it is for us. What are they doing right under us? Only you can do it. l can't trust anyone else with this task. We'll make it a business trip. Can you pass it as a business trip? We'll do it. An advance, a per diem. Anything it takes. lf you want, we can give you an artist to make drawings. Have you brought anything new? ''Blue Mountains, or Tien Shan''. Everyone can go. You stay. Prepare all the papers for Soso's business trip. Call Aniko, let her clean up here. Tell Tina not to let anyone in. What the devil! Have a seat. Oh, that motoball! - So you've kept both titles? - Yes. You're stubborn, Soso. You won't be able to make it out, let me read it to you. - The whole story? - Yes, the whole story, of course. You know what, Soso? Read me some parts, the key moments. - l may not read it at all. - Why are you getting angry? Yes? Speaking. Yes, l'll be there. l'm already on my way. Did you hear? l got to go. They call me. What can l do? l'll be back soon. - When are you going to take it out? - Any time you like. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow they'll bring blue stone. - The day after tomorrow. - We'll have to unload paper. - When, then? - Any time you like. When?! Today, if you want, or tomorrow, but we need Murmanidze's resolution. Wait for me here. l'm going to Murmanidze. Don't leave! You've locked me in. How can l leave? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Have you done the paperwork for his business trip? We don't have forms for underground business trips. No one has ever sent anyone on a business trip underground. Pass it as a ground trip, a mountain trip. He'll get more money. That's what he's just written, ''Blue Mountains, or Tien Shan''. But leave only one title. Catch up with me in the hall. When shall l read it to you? l can read it myself. What am l here for? - Couldn't you make it shorter? - That's not all here. - When will be the discussion? - lt should've been discussed long ago. Soso, you must be more active. Bother people. - l am bothering you. - Good. l'm going to the credit bank. Hello, Aniko. We'll discuss it tomorrow. And Chorgolashvili is here. Dear Vaso, discuss the ''Blue Mountains'' tomorrow. - Tomorrow is Saturday. - The day after tomorrow. - That will be Sunday. - On Monday, then. On Monday we're meeting people from Department of Motor Vehicles. We can't postpone it any more. Have both the discussion and the meeting. - The mountain business trip. - Very good. So you've kept two titles? All right. You can go. - Have you taken the picture out? - Murmanidze... Forget about Murmanidze. You got my resolution on your request? Yes, but they say it's not enough. - Take that picture out. - Yes, we'll do as you say. The elevator should be stopped. lt's on the brink of breakdown. When did its warranty period expire? - When we got the elevator. - You see? We've been sent someone else's paper in an open train car. Get that man out of the elevator. He's not of the faint-hearted kind, yet... - What about the paper? - Unload it! l can't do everything for you! l will not sign the old payroll sheets until you bring me the new ones. All right. - Going to the mountains? - l am. - There're avalanches, you know. - l know. - lt's crooked, you hung it wrong. - Lower that side, Mikho. - Come to see me after lunch. - All right. Congratulations! l've been on your side all along. - Are you satisfied at last? - Yes, it was a matter of principle. Follow me. He's coming. Good morning. Please sit down. - ls everybody here? - Guivi's on a business trip. He's always on a business trip. - Who's playing the zurna there? - There's a wedding in the yard. You already back, lrodion? - Back from where? - From your vacation. l haven't gone on vacation yet. l was told you were on leave. And what does dear Lali have to tell us? l counted 6,000 lines exactly. Well, that's what we have. Let's start. What are you waiting for? - Go ahead. - Why me? You begin. l have very little time. l'm expecting actors. They asked me not to be late. Let's be brief. Please, dear Vaso. All right. Today we're here to discuss ''Blue Mountains, or Tien Shan''. lt's very urgent. We'll transfer it. For the last time. As if they don't know we're in the demolition zone. Speaking. Hello. Wait. l'm not speaking to you. Go on. l passed the blue stone over to the technical department. l got it. Yes, l heard. The wine and fruits are here. Come back soon. Come here and we'll decide it. Otar, do you have something to say about the ''Blue Mountains''? l didn't have time to read it, but l'm for it. l liked it. Thank you. Go ahead, dear Vaso. Today we are to discuss ''Blue Mountains, or Tien Shan''. Without the author? l thought he... Murmanidze won't sign it. We need seven more air conditioners. Two of the three don't work here. Why do we work, and the conditioners don't? Go on, please. So, today we're discussing ''Blue Mountains, or Tien Shan''. He's kept two titles after all. Who's going to clear up the rubbish? We're counting on them, and they're counting on us. We'll clear it up. Let's begin. Today we're discussing ''Blue Mountains, or Tien Shan''. What happened? What is it with you? lt's my head again, and that occasional rocking. lt's all muddled up in the payroll sheet. Kopaleishvili's salary for the second half hasn't been added. Tsveraba and Khaburdania are not included for a bonus. The holiday pay due to lrodion is written out to Kopaleishvili. Can anyone tell me whether l'm here or on leave? - You're here. - Calm down, don't get excited. Dear Tamara, let Otar sort it out and report to me. All right. Excuse me, where did you feel that shock coming from? Leave me alone! Go away! Don't get distracted, comrades. Yes? l see. Where does that sound of zurna come from? ls the window closed? l'll go and look. Ah, it's you. We're having a discussion. lt's nailed down. Come tomorrow and we'll talk. All right? Go ahead. Please, comrades. Shukri, please. l repeat, dear Vaso, that l don't read on principle. l have reasons for that. Everybody knows it, and Soso, too. - l thought he didn't know. - He knows. Go on. Please. We've got Gamkrelidze's written conclusion. l've carefully looked through ''Purple Mountains''... Not purple, but ''Blue Mountains''. Right, blue. l'm pleased to inform you that, in general, l approve and share the point of view of those who gathered here. l fully subscribe, and so on, Gamkrelidze. Please. lt should have been read in the end. What difference does it make when Gamkrelidze's conclusion is read. We've fixed it. Tamara took it to Murmanidze to sign. Everything's all right, dear lrodion. Oh God, how hot it is! Shall l open the window? Look what's going on outside. That din and dust from those motorcycles. Don't open the window. What about the bonus? We could pay it, but Murmanidze won't sign. - But we've got the money? - Yes. Quiet! Let's go on. Your turn, dear lrodion. Actually, l shouldn't have been here now. l'm on leave, in fact. l'd say that l like Gamkrelidze's conclusion very much. As for the second title, l agree with Vazha Zazayevich's opinion. l like both titles, but l believe only one should be left. Dear lrodion, we would like to know if you back up this work. l back up Gamkrelidze's conclusion. Hi, Soso! - Hello. - Hello, Soso. - Here. - You've written some more? A report on my business trip. Already? - Hello. - Who could imagine that? - Who's supposed to sign it? - l think you are. First they have to sign. Why are you late? What were you doing there? l've found the cause of vibration. They're building the subway under us. They blow up hard rocks. They've gone through the hardest area, the explosions will end soon. We're saved! What's the matter? lt's the radio operator. l'll be right back. Stop it now! You said, after the applause. That's not the right applause. lt's too early, we're in conference. l have to leave for a minute. What are you discussing? - Haven't you notified Soso? - Well, of course... Why are you looking like that? We should close the door, there's a draft. The technical department didn't accept the blue stone. Put it in a dry place. Close the window, l'm tired of that zurna. The windows are nailed down tight. Don't touch the bottles! - Shall l open one for you? - No. Let me know when the guests arrive. You will say a welcome speech. - Why l? Spare me, please. - l won't even listen to that. Dear Lali, we're listening to you. To me? You may be listening to me, but what can l tell you? - Tell us whatever you like. - Do you have any special opinion? l don't have any special opinion. She has no opinion at all. l like the title. Let's go on. ls Guivi here? - He's on a business trip, isn't he? - Yes. When will he be back? Who knows? More likely, by the end of the month. Have a seat and wait. Who else wants to speak? Who is Guivi? l don't know him. How long has he been with us? Boris, please. But be brief. Brief? lt's not by chance that the author has chosen this title. There's something poetic about it, l would say. The blue colour, the azure colour... Your move. - l approve the title, too. - Get to the point, comrades. Who's next? How many discussions must we hold next month? Sixteen planned, twenty-one pledged. We must have them all! Work more efficiently! We're doing our best. Let's hear our specially invited board members, our dear Varden and our dear Yevgeny. - Shall we speak together? - One at a time. Let me begin. The point is that we could speak more extensively, but, to our great regret, we haven't been able to read the story. The copies has never reached us. - Vazha Zazayevich! - What is it, Tina? They're here. Entertain them for a while. Our dear Varden and Yevgeny haven't even been given a copy. Besides that, someone is at a refresher course, someone's fishing, someone's at a seminar, someone's at a funeral. - What is it now? - Your wife is here. What does she want? She wants to meet the actors. She's with her girlfriends. Oh, my goodness... Speaking. Yes, of course, just a minute. Speaking. Hello. l liked it, but not so much. No, we don't need it. We don't need it, but you may bring it. No, we're busy now, bring it tomorrow. Dear friends, as far as l'm concerned, l will refrain from any comments. l'm sure you'll make a right decision, but l've got business. Soso, couldn't you get that subway tunnel deviated from us? l guess it's not very difficult to do. l congratulate you in advance. What's up again? There're salaries due to our dear Varden and Yevgeny. lf l don't pay them today, l'll have to deposit them. Very well. Oh, how hot it is... lt's hellishly hot! That man will drive me crazy. Take him away. lsn't it time for a break? - ls there a bonus? - No. - And the competition pay? - No. Quiet, comrades. The board meeting is adjourned for today. - Have we accepted ''Blue Mountains''? - At this stage, yes. One of us must write a conclusion. l can't sign it, it's lrodion's duty. l'm on leave. The conclusion must be handed to the director, together with a copy. - And what will Soso do? - What he's been doing before. Right. Who has a copy? There's not a single copy, so we have nothing to talk about. l don't feel well, open the window. There's no air to breathe. Soso had several copies registered at the bureau. - We should ask Lyuba. - Lyuba has passed away. But there must be the number. Who remembers the number? l remember. lt ends with a zero. Tengiz, where's my copy? You gave it to me, l read it, and returned it. Several times. You mean you read it before me? Of course not, you always read before me. So where's my copy? You gave it to me, l read it, and returned it. Then l took it again, and returned it again. Took it again, and returned it for the last time. You never returned it to me! You probably threw it out of the window! Threw it away?! Who do you think l am? l'm not a boy! l'm a responsible man! How dare you talk to me like that? l'm talking to you like you deserve it! Let him go! Or he's going to strike me! How could you even think of that? Are you going to say now that Soso has never submitted any copies? What do you mean, never submitted? l didn't say he's not submitted... Leave my wife alone! Leave her alone! Oh, come on, who needs your wife? This is our conference room, dear Medea. l'm so happy you've come. We're all happy. This way, please. What institution is that? Who invited us? l don't know. - Please. - Thank you. Let's welcome our guests! Oh God, dear Vaso! Help! Let me through! That's the last thing we need. Hello? Send an ambulance! A man has been injured. ''Greenland'' fell down on his head! - Why didn't you take the picture out? - We did. - Why didn't you take it away? - Murmanidze didn't let us. What does Murmanidze have to do with it? Get it out of here now! - How is he? - All right, he came to. Dear Vaso, hold on. - Hello. - You're an old cavalryman. l was a tank man before the war. Very well. Vacate the premises! lmmediately! And orderly! Who invited us here? What institution is that? Where're you going? Come back, dear guests! The front door's closed! Follow me! At a distance! The exit is on your right! Dear lrodion, quick! Run! Please, don't panic. This is a dangerous zone! - Go on. - After you. Go! No reception today! l've brought my sonnets. Artyom Chachanidze. Sonnets. Good. Keep a distance! Keep up the speed! Tell the patient that l'll bring him a copy to the hospital. lrodion! Oh, that motoball! ls everybody here? Now they'll find the money for major repairs. We took the picture out. l forgot my hat. With no hat in such hot weather... Where're you going? Get your leave pay. l have the sheets here. How can l go on leave without a hat? l said it was rocking. - Where did that shock came from? - Don't come near me! - You're alive! - You all may go to hell! Take your sheets! l'm going home. Give this to Murmanidze. l'll read the sonnets at the bank. Go on with the discussion, don't leave. Tell Soso to keep only one title. Keep me posted. Take it out! Out! l don't say, throw it away. Just take it out! You want to throw ''Greenland'' away because you're afraid that it'll fall on your head again? l'm not afraid of anything! l'm not afraid of anybody! l have no right to take the picture out. Who has the right?! The End
