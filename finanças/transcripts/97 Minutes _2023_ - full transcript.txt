- Oceanic 420, heavy. Any PIREPS on the headwinds coming in? - Roger that. 97 minutes fuel time remaining. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Hope you've been enjoying the flight up 'til now and managed to get a little bit of sleep on this red eye to New York. We've got a slight headwind, which has really affected our arrival time. Our wonderful flight attendants are doing one last round of refreshments, and make sure you enjoy the tail end of this flight. New York is a brisk 65, and if you look out the windows as we land in a little over an hour and a half you'll see the sun rising over Manhattan. Sit back, enjoy the ride. The turbulence should be minimal. - He's got a gun! He's got a gun! - Air marshal! Just calm down. Nobody has to get hurt. - What happened? - Get up! Get him outta here, come on! Come on. - Yes. - Chief, you better come out here. Flight 420 and 30, last track two niner five. Copy that. Steak-knife, come in. - Steak-knife, please respond. Steak-knife, do you copy? Over. - Sit rep? Our 767 out of Heathrow just pinged gold, chief. - Transponders still tracking? - Switched off. Radar track only. - And our assets? - No contact yet. - Do we know their current fuel? - 77 minutes of current reserves. - Course 295, course 295. Copy? - Toyin. - Look sharp. The director's on his way now. - How did he look? - Pissed. - What? - The tin man's here. - Great. - Director Hawkins, I- - Tell me about the bird, Toyin. - Oceanic Flight 420, out of Heathrow to JFK, dropped off the transponder network at 04:11 hours. Confirmed multiple armed hostiles on board. - What about the failsafe? - Disengaged locally. - How was it disengaged? - We're not sure. Could have been damaged during the takeover, or they figured out how to disarm it. - Without the failsafe, auto pilot won't be able to realign the airplane to a safe airport. - So they can't fly it and we can't fly it. - No, the plane's gonna crash, sir. - Do we know how many hijackers? - Five. - Have we made contact with them? Do they have any demands? - Not with the hijackers, no, but we've been getting intermittent signals from our asset on board. - What asset? - Come in. Steak-knife, can you copy? - Shut up! - Have you seen my dad? - You're what? How the hell would I know? - He's flying the plane. - Son... - Dad? Dad! Help him, please! - Shit... Hey, stop doing that, kid. Stop, stop that. I need a med kit. - Economy. In the back. Economy. In the back. - What's he saying? Dad. - What's your name? - Samuel. - Give me your hand. I need you to hold pressure on your dad's neck here. Use both your hands. I'm gonna go find a med kit. Listen, don't let go, okay? Shit. - Come in. Steak-knife. - What are you looking for? - Med kit. Pilot's been shot. - Can I help you? - Shut up! - Find me someone, a nurse, a doctor, anyone. - Okay, go before they see you. I'll come and find you. - We need someone with medical training. Medical training. Anybody with medical training? A nurse, doctor... - My God, I think someone's been shot. They need a doctor. - A nurse, doctor? Please. - He's one of them. - Please. - Nobody move! - Who is this asset? - Deep cover operative. Works with our friends across the pond. Implanted with the transnational extremist cell in Ukraine late last year. - Russian separatists. - We don't know their agenda yet. - It seems we don't know much of anything, do we? - Well, we have a very weak signal via satellite comm relay. Miniaturized earpiece from DARPA. - Why didn't our asset warn us? - With all the intel we've been getting on detainees lately, the current SOP for these guys is, don't tell your people the plan until it's time for them to know the plan. Best guess is-- - I don't want guesses, Toyin. I need intel. - Play the last transmission. This is Steak-Knife. We have a hijack situation. Is Naznas waiting? I repeat, is Naznas waiting? - Naznas. CIA picked that up on their chatter too. All right, first order of business. ID the hijackers. Get on the horn with the asset's handler, find out everything you can about the embed. Track every ground and airline employee with access to that plane to the last three ports. Second, we need eyeballs on that plane. AWACS diverted onstation and F-22's ready for a Code Orange scramble. I don't know who's that was, but that's my office now. I need a secure line to the White House, and a coffee. Black, no sugar. - Director Hawkins. You're initiating a Code Orange? On whose authority? - I think I just mentioned the White House, didn't I? - Sir, we have a man on the inside. If we just give him time... - Your comm link is down. Your asset is in way over his head. You've got five armed hostiles in control of a 767. I would say that our opportunity vanished the moment that failsafe was disabled. - But this can't be our first play. - This is not the beginning of some heroic story. In 10 minutes, our birds will be in the air, and 20 minutes after that, they'll be in the position to end this. And some innocent people are going to die so that more innocent people will live. - RAD 21, please confirm we are firing at passenger aircraft on sight. - Confirmed, RAD 21. Rules of engagement are FOS and weapons free. Locate and destroy flight. - Copy that. - Sam, move to the inside. - I found us a doctor. They didn't see us leave. - I saw three of them down there. - I saw two in the front. - Is he gonna be okay? - He's gonna be fine, Sam. - Put your hand on this. Just get 'em round his side or else we got a problem, okay? I'll get some some water. - Allow me. I bandaged many wounds in the war. - Keep him alive. We'll need him. - If he stops breathing, call me. Only me. - Steak-knife. Steak-knife, do you copy? Steak-knife, come in. Respond, please. - We're running out of time. We need that link-up. - I tried every keyhole in range. He might be receiving, he might not. - What about the failsafe? Is there some way to re engage? - Not if it's a hardware issue, no. Okay. Here we go. Okay, yes. - What is it? - I have a friend at the CIA who's been tracking all this Naznas chatter. He found a thread on the Ukrainian dark web. - This is bad. - What? - Naznas is a code for a mass extermination event. This is some end of days type shit here. I mean, if our hijackers were actually messing around with something they're calling Naznas, well, then, this is more than just a hijacking. This whole thing is gonna get a hell of a lot worse. - Let's not let it get worse. - What the fuck, Orca? You shot all the attendants. You could have brought the plane down. Do not fire your weapon again. - I take orders from God, not from you. - You don't like it? Get off my plane. - You're fucking weak. - You keep an eye on him. - Agreed. Let's go. - Who was that woman with the pilot? - She's a doctor. She's keeping him alive. You don't have control. - Don't worry about that. You just keep an eye on the passengers. - Phone. - Goran was supposed to collect the phones! - Whose fucking phone is it? Show me your phone. Show me your phone. - Give him your phones! Give him your phones! - Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Good boy. - What's going on? - Shut the fuck up. Keep walking. - Where are you taking me? - Shut up. - No, no no no! - Shut the fuck up! - No, no, no, no, no. - Shut up! Do you know what this is? This is satellite communications. Do terrorists have satellites, or do states have satellites? - So what the fuck are you? - I'm Interpol. - What, like, undercover? - Yeah, like, undercover. - Oh, you're full of shit. - Really? Then why haven't I put a bullet in your fucking head yet? - We need to involve the other passengers. - You do not blow my cover. - You just did. - You're one person. The more people know, the more likely the hijackers will know. So, for both our fucking sakes, keep it shut. I could use your help. - Goran! - Move! - What is that? - Nothing. It belonged to my son. - Shrapnel? - Yeah. - How old was your son? - We need to get to the pilot. Come on. - What is that? - Surveillance footage of the flight maintenance on a fuel stop in Qatar. I have a friend there. - Anything? - Where's the Heathrow footage? - Server crashed, sir. - Before or after takeoff? - 20 minutes before. - Tell me you don't believe in coincidence. - No, sir. - Give me more, please. - Fucking animal. - Hey, you doing okay? - Please stand back. Hey, I need you to get me blankets, towels, anything we can use as bandages, okay? Go. - All right. - Okay, Sammy, I'm gonna take care of your daddy, all right? I need you to stay really calm, okay? He's an undercover agent. He's gonna help us, all right, sweetie? He's gonna save us. Don't you worry, okay? You stay calm. - Hey, I got these. - Okay. I told him about you. - After I specifically told you not to? - Yeah. But we need the other passengers, all right? - Tell me this. When the doctor told you that smoking causes cancer, did you start straight away or did you give it a fucking day or two? - I don't understand. - The more people know my identity, the worse it is for your fucking health. - Everything okay over there? - Yeah, we're good. Aren't we good? Do your fucking job. - Are you okay? - Huh? Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah. - How long have you been a terrorist? - You know what, Sam? I don't really consider myself a terrorist. - Then what are you? - I'm just a man who's about to get your father a glass of water. - Shit. We're flying too high, too fast. Anan. - What's happening? - Where's the altimeter? - 30,000. It's steady. It's not rising. - No, we're level. - Cabin pressure. - 15 psi. We're over pressured. Normally, it's nine, nine and a half. Goran's gun may have punctured the fuselage. - There's gotta be a problem with the cabin pressurization system. - It's rising. Past 17, the hull could rupture. - How much time do I have? - Five minutes. - Shit. Hey. Wake him up. - No, he's still unstable. - Hey! I need the pilot to help me fix the cabin pressure. - He'll die. - If you don't wake him up, we'll all die. - No, everything I've done up until now is just basic. I can't be responsible for... - Hey! You're not responsible. You didn't shoot him. Wake him up. It's gonna be okay, Sam. - Hey. Sam... Where's your EpiPen, Sam? - In the back. - Meds, meds. Go get all the meds. - Marko! Everybody, listen up. I need your medication now. - We need meds. Asthma inhalers, EpiPens, anything you've got. - Come on, come on, come on! - Okay. - Hey, this is everything they got. - 17 psi. - Hey. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. - Too little Epi, he stays out. Too much, he codes. - Relax. - That's two. - Nothing's happening. - That's not enough. - Just wait. - He needs more. - He could stroke out. - Do it. - No, wait. Please. - Hey, Sam, Sam, look at me, look at me! You've gotta trust her to do her job right now. Okay? - 17.4 psi. - Do it. - 17.6! - Do it! Now! - What's happening? Where am I? - Hey, hey. The plane's been hijacked. A bullet has pierced the hull somewhere. We're losing cabin pressure and we're at 17 psi. How do I fix it? - The valve must be stuck in manual. Flip it to automatic. That will help regulate the pressure. - Where is the valve? Captain! What's happening? Inject him again. - No, he'll stroke. - We are out of time! - Row seventeen, red valve, blue conduit. - Got it. - Save my boy, please. Save my boy. - 17.8. 17.9! 18! 17.8. 16. 14 and falling. - You killed him. You killed him, you killed him, you killed him, you killed him! - Hey. - Sit down! - Alex? You did everything you could. Let me see your hand. - I'm good. - Just give me your hand. You're wrong, you know. - Am I? - I quit everything. I quit my residency. - I guess you had your reasons. - Yeah. Yeah, shitty ex. He was a narcissist. Needed me to think that I was worthless without him. And he was really good, you know? Towards the end, I almost did believe him. We fought a lot, slept even less, and one day I administered meds to a patient without checking their charts. Those were meds, they'd already been given. And that's the day that I quit my marriage and my residency. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me, too. - Seven. - What? - My son. He was seven. - What now? - We wait. - No. We have to take control of the plane. It looks like a toy. - Yeah, it looks like a toy, but it's not a toy. It's a 3D printed gun, basically the same as a real one, with a two shot capacity. - How does it work? - Cock the hammer, sensitive trigger. - No magazine? - Magazine. Point. And shoot. Got it? - Yeah. - Come on, Remy. The F22s are gonna be on them any minute! - I'm trying. - Try harder, man! - Steak-knife, come in. - Do you have your man? - This is Steak-knife. - Yes, go on. - The pilot's dead. There's no one to fly the goddamn plane. What's the plan now? - What do I tell him? - There's no way to reestablish the failsafe control from the ground? - Not if there's mechanical damage, no. - Well, what about him? Can't we transfer a packet that he can install locally, or something? - Not at 30,000 feet. - What's the ETA on the raptors? - Six minutes, sir. - Where are they now? - Farm County, PA. - You tell them we'll have remote control of the failsafe system in 10 minutes. - Yes, sir. - You want him to stand down so the F22s can shoot him down. - Sometimes you have to put down your dog. Nobody wants to. - But you're making sure that happens. - Look, if you have a magic bullet, I'm all ears. If not... - Roger. Roger, Steak-knife. Do not take any action. Ground control will regain failsafe control remotely in 10 minutes. - Good news? - Not sure yet. You need to find somewhere to sit down and buckle up. Go on. - Sit the fuck down! - Sit down, you! - Hey, we need to do something. - I don't know what. What do they want? - I don't know. I say we make a stand. - Sit, sit! Get the fuck down. You! - Even if we overpower them, who's gonna fly the plane? That lady saw the pilot lying on the floor dead. - We'll figure something out. It's time to make a move. - Get back to your fucking seat. Get back to your fucking seat. - Kim, I'm so scared. - Ssh. Okay. All right, I need you to stay inside here, okay? Be brave. Don't open the door to anyone, okay? Do not open for anyone. - Where's Goran? - I'm not his fucking babysitter. I haven't seen him. - Orca, pick up the phone. Orca, pick up. Is Goran back there? - No. - Are you alone? - No, I'm with Leika. Why, what's wrong? - Alex is distracted by the passengers. He's either losing his way, or... - What? - Just find Goran. - I've told you, you trust Alex way too much. - Overwatch, it's RAD 21. Please confirm you're fixed on target. - Target is at 3-5-0, holding steady on previous course. - Copy that. We'll intercept at 4.5. - We have to do something. Warn him. - Yeah, but what good will that do? Besides, any communication will be monitored. Wait. - What? - Wait, wait, wait. Sigint. Signal interrupt. I can fire a white noise, then modulate the connection to the satellite. On his end, it will just cut in and out. Right? Like dots and dashes. - Morse code. - We could get in a hell of a lot of trouble. - Do it. - All right. - Shit. - Rad 21 at eight-nine-niner. Target acquired. - Tell him it's headed to the starboard side, impact in 45 seconds. - All right, 45 seconds. - Sidewinder is locked and loaded. On my mark. Two. One. Fire! - What is it? What is it? - Negative impact. - Shit! - Marko, come with me! - What the fuck was that? - What are you doing? Anan! Anan! - Second strike to launch, vector in range. Arming A to A. - What was that? - Unknown, sir. - You motherfucker. - What is it? - Ghosts. Sir, I have ghosts. - What the hell? - Multiple phantoms. - Must be HBTD. - To confirm, A985 frequency. - Can't be. That's Russian. - HBTD? - High-band transmission device. Soviet bombers used them to confuse American radar during the cold war. - Radar is useless. We're flying blind! - Friendly confirmed! Heavy out of Atlanta in our airspace! - Christ, we were supposed to have clear air! Who gave them that fucking clearance? - Raptor 2 back in formation for second launch. - Goddamn it! Abort! - Do what she says. - Raptor abort! Raptor abort! - Negative, control. Cannot abort. - What the hell... - It's gonna hit! I'm too close! - Hey. - That's a direct hit, sir. - Oh, my God! We're taking on debris! - We lost the friendly. Raptor One, come in. Raptor Two, do you copy? Sir, we've lost both F22s. - That's why we sent three. - Raptor 3 engaged. - Move! Move! - She's in the clear. Missile grazed it, sir. - All right, let's get them back on mission. - What? No. No, you cannot go through with this. We are shooting at unarmed civilians in uncontrolled airspace. - No, we're shooting down a 200 ton missile that's gonna kill a lot of unarmed civilians. This is war, chief. They started it and we're responding. The order stands. Terminate on sight. - What is that? That's an impact trigger. - Yes. - That's a nuclear warhead. - What do you think the Americans will do when a Russian nuclear bomb destroys their city? How long will the world burn? - You want to start a war between the superpowers? - No, Marko. I want a world without superpowers. What we do today is the beginning of their end. - Asghar, pull up the Qatar footage. And have our asset there pick up the engineer. Wait a minute... Sir, I have something you may want to see. All right, look here. This is the kit trolley in Qatar, tarmac security in the last three days. What do you see? - They're loading the planes. - Right, all 767s, one load per plane. - What's your point? - Okay, so here's our 767. There are two crates. All right, now look at the wheels. Before, and after. - Now, that's carrying some serious weight. Now how much do those Russian scramblers weigh? - 20, 30 pounds. - That engineer left more than just a scrambler on that plane. - Raptor three is in position. I'm waiting for a go code. - Sir, the raptor is waiting on your go command. - What is it? - It could be anything. - But, you think it's something. What? Sir, we don't believe in coincidences, right? - Back during the Cold War, the Soviets developed a handful of low yield portable devices. Once the wall came down, almost half of them disappeared overnight. - Wait a second. Low yield? Sir, you're talking about-- - You're talking about nukes. Are we looking at Russian involvement? - No, it was smuggled through Lithuania years ago, along with the scramblers. Division has been trying to track them ever since. - Jesus Christ. - Naznas. A nuclear blast. Yes, go ahead. Uh-huh. Wait, this has been confirmed? - What? - Engineer's talking. Says there's a nuclear device placed on that flight. Thank you. - I need the SecDef on the phone right away. Abort. - Abort, abort. Abort. - Mr. Secretary, we have a situation here. I suggest we go to Defcon Two immediately. - Leika... - Orca! - Okay, so look, I got the specs on one of these things. It's a fucking nasty piece of work. See, look, here. It's fitted with an impact detonator. - So now we have to shoot it out of the sky. There's no other choice. - Nuclear explosion at that altitude creates an EMP pulse that'll knock the Eastern Seaboard back into the Stone Age. - So, we can't shoot it out of the sky, and the nuke goes off when it crashes. - Exactly. - God damn... - Sir. I have something I think you should hear. We pulled this down off a geostationary DMSP satcom about 20 minutes ago. It's a signal between Oceanic 402 and this facility. - You got lucky. - I did what I thought was right. - Who the fuck do you think you are? We're not in some ethics seminar at Harvard Law. We're not here to do what we think is right. We're here to follow orders. You deliberately disobeyed me. - And stopped a nuke from- - Please don't interrupt me. The only reason you're not wearing government issued bracelets right now is because of that nuke. - There's still a chance! - How do you know? - Because there's always a chance! - How many times have you applied for the director's job, my job, and been rejected? - Five. - You still believe there's a chance? Because you haven't lost. Because you haven't really lost. You haven't learned how difficult the consequences of indecision can be. You haven't had to make a call on a sleeper cell, responsible for the bombings of grade schools, only to have Washington stand you down because they didn't want to escalate. You didn't have to stay up for two weeks straight because your daughter was kidnapped by that same cell that Washington told you not to touch. You didn't have to watch her beheading on a livestream. - I'm sorry. - Luck runs out. And the only reason you think there's still a chance is because you don't know what the world really is. - Maybe not. But I know what it can be. - You can go. - What do we do now? - Listen to me. This is a suicide mission. They're using this plane as a missile. - We don't know that for sure. - Our own government tried to shoot us down. Nobody's coming. We're on our own. - Heathrow finally came through with the security footage. We're running face analysis on it now. - Where are we with that comm link? - Seven minutes until the satellite's in range, sir. - Let's stop bullshitting! Our guy needs a plan, and now. - All right, just take that back. It's no good. Go back and see what they say. - Fuck! - Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. - Let him go! - Fuck! - Give me the gun Stop fucking around. - Let me ask you this. What is the greatest struggle, my brother? - To avenge the slaughter of the innocents. - What I am asking is a more difficult question. The path that you were on will not lead you to the peace you are seeking. - Vengeance is both rational and morally justifiable in the face of injustice. Prompted to my vengeance by both heaven and hell. - You missed the moral of that story. Hamlet is blinded by his revenge. It steers him down a path of evil. His deeds inevitably become worse and worse without him realizing the gradual corruption of his soul. The struggle to forbid the evil to mend the good, this battle, this is the greatest struggle, my brother. The journey to find the true way. - You're not my brother. - Remy. - Jesus, Chief. - I know how we can reboot the failsafe. - How? - We reinstall it. - What? - The backup boot is still up there on the main flight control server. Now that the failsafe has been disengaged, we can install the package remotely. - Yeah, but sir, we have no way of transmitting the run code. The packet's way too big for a commercial airline to receive it at that altitude. - But not the raptor escort. They get mission packages twice that size. - What, you're saying the raptor becomes a relay? - Once you download the package, the install will take care of itself, and we'll have a fresh failsafe ready to accept the default set up codes. Can you do this for me, Remy? - Absolutely, sir. - Goran! You. Get back to your seat. - Can I please have some water? Please! - Shut up! - Facial analysis just finished the Heathrow footage. We got IDs on all but one. - Slouris. - Enid Slouris? - Now we know where they're headed. - Where? - Here. He's coming for me. - Anan, what are you doing? - Why is Slouris coming here to kill you? - Because history always catches up with you. - You knew him? - I created him, after my daughter. - What did you do? - I wanted to hurt as many of them as I could. I didn't care what it cost or who had to pay the price. The man most responsible for Catarina's death, that's Enid's wife, was named Abdul Hamas. He worked out ofa local market, using civilians in a nearby village as human shields. He didn't think we would risk that kind of collateral damage, but intelligence didn't know about the ammonium nitrate munitions depot. One of the boys in that school was the son of Enid Slouris. After that... Slouris became a virus. He infects other extremist terrorist groups, he perverts their supposed politics. He uses them for his own purpose. Remember that attack in Cape Town two years ago? - Yeah, that was Green September. - That was Slouris using Green September. - And now he's on that plane coming for you. - I need to go to the cockpit. - Did your friends get in touch? - Just get the passengers ready to roll on my signal. - There's four of them between us and the cockpit. - Five. - I know Alex is with us. He can fly the plane. - That makes no sense, he killed that guy. - I don't have time to explain. You're just gonna have to trust me. - If we do nothing, we will die. We must take a stand together. - I'm not doing anything until we can prove that- - You don't have a choice. He's the only one who can help us. - Shut up! What do you think you're doing? Shut up. - Somebody has a plan and we're taking over the plane. - Orca! - This is it! - Again! - We are with you, my brother. - You are a traitor Alex! - The traitor was Marco. Doctor. I think some of your passengers may need your help. I'm good. - Yeah, they're all down. - Steak-knife, can you hear me? - Who is this? - NSA Director Hawkins. Steak-knife, priority one, enter the cockpit. - Mr. Hawkins... Copy that. - If anyone's wounded, let yourself be known. - Steak-knife, your F22 escort is standing by to transmit the reset codes for your failsafe system. - What good does that do me? - You'll automatically be diverted to runway 2882, 10 mile due South of your current position. Once the failsafe is restored, you'll have to reset the navigation breakers under the center console. - 10 miles... We don't have enough fuel, sir. - Yes, you do. There's still a chance. - Can you really fly this thing? - When I flip the switch on these navigation busses, the control system will lose power. - And then what? - Buckle up. - I need everyone to buckle up! - Antenna's online, sir. - Yep. - Raptor 3, transmit. - Roger, command. Transmitting packet. - It's done, sir. - Reset the breakers. - Come on! You're mine now. - Nice work, Steak-knife. Now, you need to input the authorization code to give the failsafe control. The code is Tango Oscar Sierra Mike Hotel Echo Lima Lima Five Four. Steak-knife, did you copy my last? We can't engage the system without the code. - I'm dead... Dead. - No. No, you're not dead. - Are they dead? The others? - Yeah. They're all dead. Except for the undercover agent that intercepted you. - No... I'm the Interpol agent.... - What? - Steak-knife, I need to hear you. Use the code. Steak-knife, are you hearing me? Please confirm you have the code. - This is Steak-knife. Identification code Alpha-Six-Three-Five. Operation American City infiltration is a ruse. Team's real mission is hijacking. I repeat, hijacking. There are five armed hijackers onboard. Do you copy? - Everyone, stay calm. Move to the left of the airplane, please. Now, ma'am. - Steak-knife, can you hear me? Steak-knife, are you there? - He never was, Mr. Hawkins. - Slouris! - Roll my sleeve. These are the access codes to the cockpit door. You have to stop him. - No, no, no, no, no, I can't... I can't fly the plane. - You can't let him crash the plane. There's a nuke on board. - No... No. Okay, okay... - No! No! I'll be with you soon. Stop! - No, you lied to me! - Just stop. - Why did you kill your own people? - I had no choice. When they found the earpiece, I knew one of them was an undercover agent. I just didn't know which one. I had to kill them all. - I helped you... God, you... - No. God has nothing to do with this. - Then what, Alex? Why? - Justice. - So we all die for your justice? Who dies for ours? When does it stop? - It never stops. Give me the fucking... Fuck! You fucking shot me. - Are you okay? Okay, come on. Okay... - Are we gonna crash? - We're gonna try not to. Hello? Hello, is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? - Someone's on the pilot channel. - Patch me in. - Can anyone help me? - Identify yourself. - My name is Kim. - Okay, Kim, my name is Hawkins. Do you have control of the plane? - I guess so, but I don't know how to fly. - What about the hijackers? - All down. - Okay, I'm gonna talk you through this. I want you to look at the main console in front of you. Tell me what you see. - Main console? - It's right here. - Here? Okay, it's asking for an authorization code. - Okay, type in the following. - These inputs, Kim. - Here, okay. Yeah, yeah, go. - Tango. - Tango. - Oscar. Oscar. Mike. - Mike. Sierra. - Sierra. Hotel. - Hotel. Echo. - Echo. Lima. - Lima. - Five four. - Five. Four. - Everybody! Get ready to brace! - Failsafe engaged. Rerouting to safe landing. - ETA to landing site? - 10 minutes, Chief. - All right. - We don't have enough fuel, Kim. Tell them. - Hello? Hello? No! Hello? - Kim? He's waking up! - It's rerouting you to the nearest automated runway. It's nine minutes away. You'll never make it. There's a private landing strip a few miles away. You'll have to go manual. - I can't do that! - Yes, you can. I'll talk you through it. - Two minutes ago you were gonna crash this plane with all of us on it, and now you want to save us? - Yes. - We're running out of fuel. We're gonna lose an engine. - Jump up, Sam. Jump up. Jump up! - Good boy. - If he tries anything, you just shoot him. - Sir, they've re-disabled the failsafe override. We've lost autocontrol of the plane. - First, that's not a steering wheel. It's a yoke. Move left and right, to roll the plane. Push forward to pitch the wheels down. Pull back to pitch the nose back up. See those pedals by your foot? - Yeah. - That's your rudder. Now, using your left leg, turn us west until this reads two-zero-two. - Everybody! Get ready to brace! - Target veering off course. Permission to fire. - Negative Raptor 31. Negative! There's a nuclear bomb on that plane! - Raptor 3 standing down. - Ah. - You did it, Kim. - What's the name of that airport they're headed for? - Patcher Field, about a mile off I-64. - I want you to contact local PD, fire, and rescue. We have to set a perimeter. Tell DOE, they need to move in and secure that nuke the moment that plane touches that runway. What's the local hospital? - Jackson General. - Tell them to expect incoming. - Four red lights, you're too low. Four white ones, you're too high. Two red, two white will get you to the runway. Now, you can't lower the landing gear or the wind will tear the wheels off. Use the throttle and push back on the nose to bleed off more speed. - Okay. - Do you feel that? You feel that? That feels good. Feels good. Now, slow down the throttle for the descent. That's good. That's good. Another second now. Another notch of flaps. - Come on! - Good. You're going slow enough for the landing gear. Push this lever. All the way down. - This one? - That? - All the way down! Sam, come here! Samuel! When we pass over the fence, I want you to cut the engine using these two buttons here. Then I want you to cut the fuel using this button here. You can't have the engine running in case anything bad happens. I trust you. Your dad would be very proud of you. Yeah. That will work. - Runway! Runway! - Sam, cut the engines! - But it's too low! - Cut the fuel! Kim! Keep her steady. Sam, brace! - Plane is down. - What? - No detonation. - Yes. - Come on, we gotta go. Come on. - Is that the fifth? - Sixth, actually. - Well, I wouldn't worry about it. There's always the chance the seventh will turn out differently. Isn't that right, Director of Operations Toyin? - Yes, sir. Always a chance. - Congratulations. And thank you.
