He is wanted in connection with the grizzly knife slayings of five Los Angeles Canyon residents in recent weeks.

Oh, this sink is all plugged up. I'm afraid something's happened to her. Here let me do that, hun. Excuse me. Wasn't Rosie fixed? Yeah, she was fixed almost a year ago but that doesn't mean that she can't go out sometimes. She wouldn't go out for that. I know her. Rosie wouldn't go out for that at all. Don't worry about Rosie, peanut. She'll be back by the time you get home from school. We better hurry up, we're gonna be late. Oh, that's disgusting. What is it? Nothing to worry about.

That's what caused the flickering light. But aren't wires inside pipes or something? Look at this. Didn't seem to bother this fella. You mean it bit straight through the pipe? A rat can do that? I've seen a seven pound rat squeeze through a quarter inch crack under a door without exhaling, Mrs. Houston. I've seen them living in mud huts along the river like beavers and nesting in trees like eagles. I've seen 'em as big as a medium size dog and as small as a big June bug. I'm no longer surprised at anything I see a rat do. Very special animals. They're horrid animals is what they are. This one is big and horrid. You saw him? Well, I saw his eyes. He was, uh, looking at me when I was underneath the house. How long have you been on vacation or wherever? Oh, we haven't been anywhere. But your little girl has been away? No, Why? Well it's obvious your pest has been working at this for several weeks. How come you didn't notice until today? Well, that wall was perfect yesterday. That happened sometime during the night. I think you better show me the cabinet he was into downstairs. oh, my god. That, madam, was not done by your average rodent. I've never seen that kind of destruction. Steven, look what this thing has done. It's worse than we thought. My name is Keefer, Mr. Houston. You've got an unusually aggressive visitor, sir. - I've never seen anything like... - You know that it's killed Rosie and I found her under the house. Apparently, my wife misunderstood me. I was under the impression that we agreed I was gonna handle this problem by myself. Steven you can't handle this problem by... How much do I owe you Mr. Keefer? Well sir, you really don't owe me anything. - Well then, thank you very much. - Steven. I apologize for having wasted your time. Steven. Wait a minute. Look, I'm not gonna let Brooke sleep up in her room. Wait till you see the damage it's done. Then she can sleep in the bedroom next to our room. Would you excuse us please, Mr. Keefer. I'm terribly sorry I bruised your precious ego. Get off my back, Claire. I had a tough clay. I had no idea it was so fragile. We have a second rat, I'll get rid of it. You know what Mr. Keefer said? - He said he's never... - You know what your problem is? Seen this kind of destruction. It's the same as 99% of the people in this world. Why don't we bring in somebody who's see this type of damage. It never occurs to you to do something yourself. Will Rosie come back? Well, you know what I think? I think Rosie might have gone to visit some friends. But will she ever come back? I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see. Now you get some sleep now. Tomorrow's another school day. Good night. Don't close the door. I won't. Good night. Good night, Rosie. I think we should buy Brooke another cat. A kitten. It probably would be best to wait until we get rid of... Hello? Mrs. Houston, it's Keefer. Yes. The reason I'm calling is, well, this might sound a little strange Mrs. Houston, but there's this old book I have from back in Germany in the 1600s. Tells about a thing called the das Teufel Nagetier. Das what? Claire, who is it? Das Teufel Nagetier. I was going to tell you about it today but Mr. Houston didn't seem much in the mood for listening. Who is that? It's late. Well, what is this Das Teufel, whatever it is? It translates into “the devil rodent". It's a legend about huge malevolent rodents with unbelievable cunning and strength that terrorize certain villainous individuals in 17th Century Europe. Claire, who are you talking to? The problem is according to the legend Das Teufel Nagetier cannot be destroyed, Mrs. Houston. That's ridiculous. Claire, who the hell is... Who is this? It's Keefer, Mr. Houston. The reason I called before is that I think the problem over there may be bigger than you realize. What in hell are you talking about? We have rats. I'll take care of them. You won't. Don't call again. Everybody's got their hand out Claire and you're always right there to fill it. He told me an awful story. Of course he did, to scare you into rehiring him. Steven? Steven. Mommy, Daddy, I'm scared. Brooke. Mommy! Brooke! Brooke. Are you all right, sweetheart? Honey, honey, oh God. Are you okay? What is going on? Oh God! Mommy. What is happening here? Steven?

Brooke, open the door. Watch out. No! You'll kill her. Watch out! Mommy! Help me! Steven! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! No, wait, you're going to kill her. I think it's trying to tell me something. What honey? What, what's the rat gonna tell you? Bring baby... Bring baby. Hers. Bring her baby back to her. Oh. Mommy, Mommy! Bring it back to her. No Daddy, please. Please Daddy, she just wanted her baby. Please, Daddy. Mommy, Daddy. Daddy, where do you suppose she's going next?
