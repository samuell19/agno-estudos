- [Charles] It is here I love you most. In moonlit fields of ripening marble. Hushed solitude of polished wood. Melting wax and whispered Latin liturgy. It is here I love you most. As you bleed into reality. Into deepening shadows. I need you, my Galatea. Welcome to my dreams. (deep breathing) - [Deborah] Do you remember when we first met? - Of course. - What was I wearing? - A long blue dress with a slit right up the side? - [Deborah] Where were we? - [Charles] It was ... it was at a restaurant. - You don't remember, do you? (chuckles) It was Nick's. Remember that little Italian restaurant? - [Charles] Yeah. - [Deborah] Why do we remember things like that? - [Charles] Well, I remember the dress because you were so beautiful. - Hmm. Well I remembered the restaurant, but I didn't remember the dress. (Deborah chuckling) Did you wanna have kids? - Of course. I love Becky to death. - [Deborah] Do you wanna have another? - [Charles] Maybe. - [Deborah] Tell me again why you love me. - Because you're beautiful, intelligent and perceptive. - [Deborah] What, that's it? - [Charles] What, you want the whole list? - [Deborah] Yes. - Okay, you're ... mature, independent, warm. And you look great in a blue dress with a long slit up the side. - [Deborah] Yeah? Hm. Do you remember our first? - Our first time? - Yeah. - It was incredible. - It was magic. I knew from that moment on I had to be with you forever. - [Charles] I just wanted to please you. - You did. Oh, you did. When you sliced her throat and that blood drained out all over my hands, oh, honey, it was orgasmic. Mm. - [Charles] Deborah? - [Deborah] Yeah. - [Charles] I love you. - [Deborah] I love you too. (upbeat jazz music) (meat sizzling) (upbeat jazz music) - [Deborah] Something sure smells good. And I am starving. - I was wondering if you ever were gonna come home at all. - Well, I'm sorry, but the stupid bitch in line in front of me at the grocery store decided that she wanted to argue about a mistake on a 10-cent item. So it took forever. - Why didn't you change lines? - Because they only had one line open. (upbeat jazz music) Oh, hey, listen, they didn't have the Chianti, so I got you this Cabernet. Okay? - You didn't vacuum like I asked. - Sorry. I got sidetracked. - By what? - Television. * Fare thee well and go to hell * * Fare thee well and go to hell * So, when's dinner gonna be ready? - Well the noodles'll take about 10 minutes. And I'm gonna throw them in as soon as the Simmons get here. - The Simmons? - Professor Simmon and his wife? We met them last week. - Okay. - And we invited them over to dinner tonight. - Oh, shit. - I completely forgot. - Why do you think I had you go to the grocery store and get all that stuff? - Because I thought you were gonna be making me a romantic dinner. - Well, sorry, not tonight. We talked about this. - Well, can we cancel? I'm not in the mood for company. - They've already called and said they're on their way. * You're strutting through that door * * I feel my passing starting to rise * Look, I'll make it up to you, all right? - Fine. - I promise. - Fine. - Fine. Now go and change. - Change? - Change into something nice. We're having guests over tonight. - Fine, God. (upbeat jazz music) * I never felt I second-rated you * * I did everything you ever told me to * - Shit. (upbeat jazz music) Oh, and don't forget that the knives face toward the plate. * So go get the shovel, dear * I'll go pick out a plot * To lay this bag of bones weary and pained * * To rest in a shady Are you done yet? - Would you like to come in here and check? - Would you chill? You're the one who forgot about tonight. What are you PMSing or something? Oh yeah, that's right. You're not having your period, are you? When were you gonna tell me about that, Deborah? - Tell you what? - You know exactly what I'm talking about. - Don't worry, I'm not pregnant. - Well then what's with the test? (doorbell ringing) - Company's here. - Charles, this is delicious. - Thank you. - It's okay. - What's in it? - Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. It's a secret recipe. - Well, it's delicious. - Wine, Deborah? - Deborah doesn't drink. - I'm in recovery. - Oh really? So is my brother. He's been sober ... five years now. - Deborah just celebrated one year of sobriety. - I had a car accident a little over a year ago. We almost lost out daughter. Really woke me up to what it was I was doing. - Oh. - Daughter? - [Deborah] Becky. - She's already in bed. Came down with a little bug yesterday. - Hm, I'm sorry to hear that. So I guess that means we won't be. - [Deborah] Won't be what? - We'll be sure to be quiet and not wake her up. - Oh, no, it's okay. We've got her in our bedroom. It's a lot quieter back there. (jazz music) - So, Lynden, tell me, what does a sociology professor do exactly when he's not teaching? - Oh, this is great. - Well, actually, right now, I'm researching serial killers and their effect on the community. - Huh. - Really? - What kinda research? - [Stacy] Tell them about the one in Pittsburgh. - Well we set up this experiment where we rented a house in this middle-class suburban neighborhood. We made sure there was a lotta foot traffic, a lotta people jogging, walking their dogs, that sort of thing. - [Charles] Like this neighborhood. - Right. So, then we had a guy move in there, and the rules were that everything he did had to be in plain sight of a neighbor. Someone had to be on the street while he was doing everything. So we started things off by having him just bring home chainsaws and axes and garbage bags and things like that. Then, in the middle of the night, we'd have him fire up the chainsaw or just start chopping on stuff so there's always strange noises coming outta the house. Nobody calls the police. - That's not so unusual. - Right, well, we didn't expect anything right away, but then we start elevating things. Start having women drive to the house. Then, in the middle of the night, the chainsaws go off and the next morning, he drives their car away and walks back to the house. Again, not a single response. - Now all of this is in front of people? - Exactly, somebody's watching everything. So, by the end of the experiment, we've got this guy on his front lawn with lights set up in the middle of the night, digging holes in his yard and then dragging garbage bags that are oozing red liquid and burying them in the middle of his yard. Not a single person calls the cops. - [Charles] Nobody, not one person? - I'm telling you, not until the end, when we had the woman go up and start banging on the door and screaming at him like he cheated on her. We got two calls for a domestic disturbance. - You're kidding. - Swear to God. - Isn't it wild? Just goes to show you how self-absorbed people are. They don't even know what's going on around them. (laughing) - That reminds me of the time that Deborah tried to set up a neighborhood watch here. - Oh, Charles, Charles, they don't wanna hear that story. You don't wanna hear that. - [Stacy] What? What happened? - No, really, really, you don't. - Okay, what happened was, they wanted to set up a neighborhood watch, but while they were having the meeting, the house next door got robbed. - You're kidding. - It wasn't my fault, Charles, stop. - But that's funny, the house next door gets robbed while you're having the neighborhood watch meeting. - No, it is not funny. Are you done now? - It's funny. It's okay. (upbeat jazz music) - Why don't I check on dessert? (upbeat jazz music) Look, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made fun of you. - You're right. You shouldn't have. - If you would just lighten up. - Don't you tell me to lighten up. - This dinner is very important for me, and you're ruining it. First you make fun of the food. Then you sulk. What's next? - I can think of a few things. - All right, wait, stop, all right? I fucked up. I admit it. - Yeah, you did. - I shouldn't have made fun of you. I'm a bad monkey. (scoffing) Now can we get through this peacefully? - I'm still pissed, though. - Fair enough ... but can we? - Sure. Just give me a couple minutes to simmer down, and I'll be okay. - All right. Maybe you can check on Becky. - You're still in the doghouse. (soft upbeat music) * Your love is killing me (sighing) * My heart stops in your arms * Once lost, for me to come in (humming) * I love you to death * I love you to death * I love you to death - Mom? - Hey you. What are you doing up? - You woke me up. - I'm sorry. (soft upbeat music) Your fever's going down. Are you feeling better? - My stomach hurts. - Well let's lay you back down. - Okay. Where's Daddy? - He's in the dining room, with company. - Can I come out? - I don't think so, Sweetie. I don't want you to give the company your flu. Do you want me to turn off the TV? - No, leave it on. - No, leave it on? Okay, well, you just lay here and get some sleep, all right, baby? - Okay. Good night, Mom. - Oh, good night, baby. I love you. - I love you too. * I love you to death (soft upbeat music) (sighing) - I wasn't sure if you wanted the tiramisu. You shoulda seen it. It was beautiful. They keeled over right in the middle of dessert. - What'd you use? - Oh you know, the usual Charlie special on top of the sweets. - Mm-hm. Nice, they're dead. - Technically, no. But they should be in another minute or two. (sighing) What's wrong? - What's wrong? God dammit, Charles. Oh I don't know, we were supposed to do this together? - You didn't even remember they were coming over for dinner. - Then once you reminded me, I remembered. - I thought you wouldn't mind. - You thought I wouldn't mind? Hell yes, I mind. I was looking forward to bashing her fucking head in with a baseball bat. - All right, you're being melodramatic. - Melodramatic? - Yes, melodramatic. - You wanna see melodramatic? - It runs in your family. You, your mother, your sister, your whole family. - Don't you dare compare me to any of them. Don't you dare bring them up! - All right, calm down, okay, just relax. I'm sorry. - Christ, Charles. You know, you promised. It was my turn. - You didn't even remember they were coming. - What does that have to do with anything? You did the last one. We agreed it was my turn. - Okay, I misunderstood. When you started talking about not wanting them to come over at all, I just assumed that you didn't care. - Well you shouldn't have assumed. I guess you shoulda asked. I mean, poison? - You know I like poison. - Yeah, I know ... completely unoriginal. - Oh, and bashing their brains in is so fresh and new. - Well, you didn't seem to mind when I bashed that one's head in in Jersey now, did you? - Of course not. You hit her so hard you knocked her head off. - Oh. I am getting so tired of this. (sighing) - Tired of what? - You, acting like your way is the right way. - What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? You're so goddam condescending. Just because I like to do things a little bit differently doesn't make you better than me. - I never said that, all right. - No, you didn't have to, did you? You just act like it. So tired of it. - Fine. Charlie fucked up. Is that what you wanna hear? - That's a start. - Okay, well you heard it. - Mm. (chewing) - Do you have to chew with your mouth open? - What? - Your mouth? Do you have to eat with it open? Can you eat with it closed, or is that too difficult a task? (throat clearing) (sighing) - Are you gonna eat your dessert? Okay, I guess it's time to clean up then. You go get the saws. I'll lay out the plastic, okay? - Kay. (soft dramatic music) (whimpering) - Hello, my little pet. How's my girl? Your face is looking good, holding up nicely. Are you thirsty? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Ah, dut dut dut. I didn't say release. And, release. Good girl. (hard breathing) (chuckling) That's enough. (hard breathing) All right. Now. If I leave that gag out of your mouth, are you gonna keep quiet? - Uh-huh. - Promise? - Promise. - You remember what happened last time. - Mm-hm. - Yeah? That's a good girl. (hard breathing) Where is she? - No! - Look at me. Where is she? - He took her. - Who took her? - The man, he came, he took her. - The man? The man, that son of a bitch. All right, where is she? - Who? - Don't play stupid with me. - What are you talking about? - The new girl, where is she? - In the spaghetti. - What the fuck is she doing in the spaghetti? - We talked about this. - No, no, we did not talk about this. - Are you calling me a liar now? - I must be, because we didn't talk about this. - Yes, we did. I said I wanted to use her for the spaghetti, and you said fine. - I said fine? No, I did not say fine. I wouldn't have said fine, because I didn't think it was fine, I had plans for her. Where's the rest of her? - [Charles] Freezer. (soft dramatic music) - This is not what I had planned. - What did you have planned? - To make her scream. To make her beg. I don't know, how about lick my fucking feet? - So this is about sex again? - Don't take that tone with me. You have your ways, and I have mine. - We can't always get our way, can we, Deborah? - No, that must be true, because that's twice now that you've taken my turn. First, you took them away from me. Then you take her away from me. You're so goddam selfish. - Would you just keep your voice down? Becky's sleeping. - No, I will not keep my voice down. And don't you try changing the subject. What? - What's this about? - About you taking my fucking turn, about you taking them away from me. - What's this really about? - [Deborah] I don't have a clue what the fuck you're talking about. - It's not about them or the girl, is it? Is this the baby thing again? - Don't you throw that at me. Don't you dare. - It is. It is. - No, it is not, it is not about a baby. - Yes, it is, you're upset because you wanna have another baby and I don't, and so now you're taking it out on me. - No, no, you were the one who promised that we could have another kid. You promised. - Why the fuck would I wanna have another kid? You can't even take care of the one we have now. You're always flying off the fucking handle, and, oh, let's not forget about the car accident. - You stop, and you stop right fucking there. That is not fair. That is not fair. Yes, I fucked up but I am sober now. So you stop bringing that up. - But Becky's-- - Let it go, Charles. Becky nothing. Yes, Becky, I fucked up, okay? I fucked up, but it's done, it's over. Let it go. - Okay, you know what? - What? - You know what? Fuck this. - Oh, fuck you. - No, no, fuck you, Deborah. I am sick and tired of your anger. I'm fed up with your self-righteous bullshit. (laughing) You cannot control your temper, and you hurt everyone around you. - You are such an asshole. What are you doing? What are you doing? - I'm going outside. - Oh no, you are not. You are not going outside. You're gonna stand right fucking here until we get this settled. - Look, standing here and arguing is not gonna settle anything, all right? I'm gonna go outside and cool down before I say something really stupid. - Do not walk away from me. Don't you fucking walk away from me! Get the fuck back in here and settle this now! (door closing) (sighing) Well thank you very fucking much, both of you. Really appreciate it. You ruined my whole fucking evening! (sighing) (soft dramatic music) (kicks striking) (hard breathing) (groaning) (hard breathing) These are so fucking important to you (breaks record). How do you feel about that? Don't care about me. Don't care about what I think or what I feel. Well fine. You wanna break a piece of me, I'm gonna break a piece of you. (record breaking) You sorry, motherfucker. (sobbing) Ugh. Ugh. (soft piano music) - Do you remember the first time we heard this? - It was at Nick's. - Mm-hmm. * There is that wicked glint in your eye * We danced in the middle of the restaurant. - Seems like such a long time ago. * Heading for simpatico lets me know * - I knew I loved you from the moment I saw you. * How dark in your heart - And you're as beautiful now as you were then. (soft piano music) * Battered, bruised - Okay. (exhaling) Okay. (hard breathing) - What are you doing? - Come here. Do you remember this one? - Yeah ... how could I forget? I almost broke my leg tripping in her guts (laughs). What? All right, what's the point? - The point is, your temper. This is what happens when you lose your temper. We didn't even plan this one. You just flew off the handle and killed her. You made a mess. I had to clean it up. We almost got caught. Do you remember that? - Yeah. - This is why I don't wanna have another baby, all right? I'm afraid of what your temper's gonna do. Deborah, I can't take this, all right? - What? - I'm tired, I'm tired of the fighting. I'm tired of the anger. I can't handle this anymore. - What are you saying? What are you saying? - I'm thinking about leaving. - Oh, no. No, you can't. - [Charles] I can't take this, all right? - You can't leave. I won't let you. - [Charles] What's that supposed to mean? - Do you still love me? - [Charles] Yes, yes, I still love you, but I can't handle this, all right? - We love each other. We can work this out. - [Charles] Look, no, it's not working. It's not gonna work, all right. We keep fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting. - Then, then counseling. - Counseling? - Yeah ... I'm not gonna lose this relationship, Charles. I'm not gonna lose you. - Deborah. - Look, we're talking right now, right? We're not screaming at each other. We're not fighting. We can work this out. We can work this out. Let's just go in the house and talk. - [Charles] No, no, listen, I'm angry, you're angry. We'll end up saying something stupid, and it'll end up in another fight. - Okay. Okay. Why don't you go for a drive then? That always cools you off. I'll go inside, and I'll clean up, okay? It'll take an hour, maybe. But then you have to come back home so that we can talk. - This isn't some kinda game? - No, no, it's not. Please. - You're not gonna get angry for having to clean up? - No. As long as you promise me that you will come back and we can talk. - Okay. (shovel striking) Okay, I can do that. (dog barking) - I won't lose you. I won't. - I'll be back in a bit. (sighing) (shovel scraping) (soft dramatic music) - Now what am I gonna do with the two of you? (soft music) (sighing) (soft dramatic music) (sighing) - What are you thinking about? - How perfect everything is. - Yeah, it is, isn't it? So did you enjoy your birthday? - Yeah, it was fun. I think the carnival wore Becky out. - [Charles] I thought you two would enjoy that. And your presents? - [Deborah] They were good. - What's wrong? Come on, what's the matter? - Do you love me? - What? - Do you still love me? - Of course I do. What kind of a question is that? - A selfish one. - All right, what's going on? - Everything that you got me was great. The CDs were great. All my presents were great. But- - But? - Do you remember what I wanted for my birthday? What I asked you for? One little piece of jewelry, something that says that you love me. That's all. I'm being a selfish bitch, but you know what? Seems to me that you weren't even listening. (sighing) - You wouldn't mean something like this, would you? - You tricked me. - Yeah, I guess I did. I am a selfish bitch. - No, you're not. Now open it. Go on. - Ah. Oh, Charles. It's beautiful. - And it's engraved. - Always. - And I will always love you, no matter what. Always. - Always. Always. Fuck you. Don't you ever lie to me again. I'll make sure that never happens. (upbeat dramatic music) (paper tearing) (upbeat dramatic music) Son of a bitch. (upbeat dramatic music) - [Becky] Mom? - Hi, baby. What are you doing up? - I heard you and Daddy. Who are they? - Oh, those are some friends of ours. - Are they sleeping? - Yes, they are. So we're gonna try really hard not to wake them up, okay? - Where's Daddy? - He went to the store. He'll be back in a little bit. - Why are you two fighting? - We're not fighting, baby. We just had a little disagreement. - I don't like it when you yell. - I know you don't, baby. I'm sorry. Tell you what, why don't, why don't I get you some of that dessert I promised? Does that sound good? - My stomach hurts. - Your tummy hurts? All right, baby. How about Daddy and I come and read to you then? When he gets back from the store, that sound good? - Yeah. - Okay. - Will you wake me up if I'm sleeping. - Yes, I will wake you up if you're sleeping. - Okay. - Mm, let's get you back to bed, okay? - All right. - Come on. Oh. (soft music) (door opening and closing) - [Charles] Hey. - Hey. - [Charles] Sorry I took so long. - That's okay, I just got finished cleaning. - Looks nice. - Thank you. - Where'd you put them? - I wrapped them up and put them away. Figured we could do something with them tomorrow. Poured you a glass of wine. - [Charles] Thank you. - You're welcome. Becky wants us to read her a story. - We can do that in a bit. - So, how was your drive? - It was fine. Just went off in the city and cooled down a little bit. - [Deborah] Feel better? - Much. - Mm. Sure do love you. (soft music) - I love you too. As a matter of fact, I've got a little surprise for you. - Oh, you do? - Yeah, come on. - No wait, sit, sit. Drink your wine and let's talk, okay? - In a while, all right? - I wanna sit and talk. - In a while. Listen, I got a gift for you. It's something to say I'm sorry, okay? Give me this. Now, sit down. Come on, sit down. - What is going on? - It's a surprise. (soft music) Now, close your eyes. - Charles, I am not closing my eyes. - Deborah, close your eyes. - You better not try anything funny. - Trust me. - Oh. - You're gonna love this. (sighing) - So where did you get it? - [Charles] It's just a little something I picked up in the city. (sighing) Okay, you can open your eyes. - Hi, I'm Mandy. - I hired her just for you. - We can't afford this. - Don't worry about that right now, okay. She's a present. - And what did you want me to do with her? - Ha ha, leave that to me. Your husband already told me what to do. (upbeat music) - Are you sure about this? What about Becky? - She's sleeping. Just watch. (upbeat music) (flesh squishing) - Deborah! - Stupid bitch. - Deborah, stop it! - Asshole. - What the fuck are you doing? - What am I doing? You said she was for me. - She was. - She was not for me. You were all fucking over her. - I thought we could ... I thought we could share. - You thought we could share? - Yeah. - You fucking prick, we have a fight, and you think that sex is gonna make it better? - Well. - Fuck you. - Put the fucking knife down. - I will not. You wanted to fuck her. - I never said that. - You wanted to fuck her. - I never said that. - You didn't have to say it. You know what, here, you want a little piece of her? Take some baby, here. - No? Your actions speak louder than fucking words. God, you are such a fucking prick, you know that? - All right, what are we gonna do about this? - Nothing, fuck you. - Oh, geez, come here. - Let go of me. I'm gonna fucking hurt you! (struggling) - You ruined everything, just like always. (struggling) - You bastard, let me go. (hard breathing) (soft dramatic music) - Charles! Charles! Where are you? Charles! - Oh, you're awake. - [Deborah] Yes, now let me go. - Once again, I've had to clean up your mess. - This isn't funny. Let me go. - I can't do that, Deborah. I'm getting tired of your temper. - [Deborah] Okay, fine, I get it. Now let me go. - Nope. I'm gonna have to teach you a lesson. - [Deborah] What are you doing? - You're gonna have to learn that you can't just fly off the handle anytime you want to, Deborah. - What is that? What is that? Don't, don't, don't, don't. - Don't struggle. - What's in it? - It's just gonna make it hurt more. Do you want that? - No, what is that? No. (moaning) What is that? - Just amphetamines. - My sobriety. - What a joke. Come on, you and I know that you been sipping wine every chance you can get. - No, I have not. I did not. I've been been sober, I've been clean, I swear. - I'm gonna teach you a lesson, okay? - [Deborah] No, Charles, please don't. - And this is gonna hurt like hell. - [Deborah] Charles. - But don't worry. The amphetamines will keep you from passing out. - Please don't, please don't. What about Becky? - Sh, sh. - What about Becky? What about Becky? She's gonna hear. Ow! That's hot, please take it off. Please take it off. Take it off. No, oh! Okay, okay. Fuck. Ow, it's hot. Get it off! Ow! Stop. (soft dramatic music) - Oh, God. - It's okay. It's for your own good. (moaning) - I'm gonna fucking kill you. - It's for your own good, okay. Now listen, you're not in your right mind right now. I'm gonna let you lay here for a bit, and think about what you did. (Deborah groaning) - Fuck. Wait, where are you going? Charles, come back here. Fuck. Think you're better than me. Why do you think you're better than me, huh? (groaning) How about that time in Dallas? Remember that time when you decided you were gonna dance with that fucking slut? You ended up embarrassing yourself in front of your friends. You made a big ole ass out of yourself, Charles. (upbeat music) * I'm so tired of these ups and downs * - Remember the time when you just needed to introduce me to your parents and you ended up getting drunk and hitting your brother? Nice one, Charles, you remember that? Everybody fucks up, Charles. Even you. Charles! Charles. (upbeat jazz music) Charlie boy. (deep breathing) - Are you awake? - Hm-mm. - You wanna mess around? - Not really. - Why not? Huh? - Do I always have to be in the mood? - No, sorry. I was just asking. - Actually, there was something that, that I wanted to ask you. - Okay. - I don't know how to say it. - Just say it. - What would you ... say if I wanted to bring another woman into our bed? - Excuse me. - [Deborah] You heard me. - You wanna bring another woman home? - [Deborah] I'm curious. - Curious as in wanting to sleep with her as well? Wow, what brought this up? - I just, I been thinking about it. I've always found women attractive, and I thought, I don't know, I thought it might be fun. - Would this involve me as well? - [Deborah] Yeah. We could tag team her. - Wow, okay, yeah. Sounds good. - Under one condition. - What? - No fucking her. That's off limits. That part of you is for me. - [Charles] Are you sure about this? - Yeah, we can try it out, see if I like it. There's ... one other thing. - What's that? - I'm just afraid you'll end up wanting her more than you want me. - You don't have to worry about that. That's not gonna happen. - Well, you're gonna have to swear to it. Otherwise, it's not happening. - Oh, I swear. I swear. - Okay. (upbeat jazz music) - You fucked up, Charlie boy. (groaning) You tried to poison me. You bitch, you tried to poison me. Deborah, stop. - [Deborah] Get away from me! (groaning) - [Charles] Deborah, let me in. - Leave me alone, Charles. - You tried to poison me! - [Deborah] And you tried to kill me! - Look, I just hurt you. I wasn't trying to kill you. (groaning) - Just go away, Charles. Go away, and calm down. (hard breathing) - [Charles] Unlock this door. - No! (hard breathing) - Fine. (Charles breathing rapidly) (soft guitar music) (hard breathing) - Mom, are you okay? (groaning) I'm scared. - I know, honey. - Is it me? - What are you talking about? - Are you and Daddy fighting because of me? (groaning) - Of course not, honey. Daddy's just being a prick. - You're not supposed to talk like that. - I know. I know, honey. You know, for someone who's supposed to be sick, you sure are getting up an awful lot. - I'm scared. - I know, baby. Lie down. - What are you fighting about? - Oh, you know Daddy. He's just being difficult. Thinks he always has to be right. - Always has to be right. Can't ever admit that she's wrong. Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, always gotta bitch. (device zapping) - [Becky] Did Daddy hurt you? - Yeah, baby, he did. He burned me. - [Becky] Does it hurt? - Yes, yes, it does. It hurts very bad. What's the matter, baby? Did Daddy hurt you? Baby, did Daddy do something to you? Becky? Did he do something to you? - He said he'd hurt me real bad if I told you. - Baby, what did he do? - He said he'll hurt you too, if I tell. - Oh, honey. No, listen to me. I'm gonna be fine, and I'll protect you. Now you listen to me, it is not okay for Daddy to hurt you. Now tell me what he did. - He touched me. - [Deborah] Oh, where? - It hurt. - Oh, my baby. It's okay. You just go back to sleep. - [Becky] You won't tell, will you, Mama? - Oh, baby, I won't tell. Everything's gonna be just fine, okay? Just fine. (door opening) Charles, are you still here? Step away from the wall. - What, are you afraid of me? (soft dramatic music) - What are you doing? - [Charles] Come and see. (dramatic music) - Put down the Taser, Charles. - Put down the bat. - No, you started this, and I'm gonna fucking finish it. I'm gonna split your fucking skull open. - Look, okay, I admit the iron was a bit extreme. All right, now put down the bat! - No, I will not. This is for Becky. - [Charles] Becky, what are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. How could you? How could you? - [Charles] How could I what? - How could you touch her like that? - Touch her? - Yes, you sick, twisted fuck. - No, no, whoa, hold, Hold on a second, all right, wait. Look. All right, I'm putting this down. (soft dramatic music) Look, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm unarmed, all right. You know I wouldn't do anything like that. - She just told me, Charles. - She what? - She just fucking told me. Don't you play with me, Charles. - Deborah, Deborah, come on. This is ridiculous, all right. All right, I'll admit, I've done some sick and evil shit in my life, all right. But you know I would never touch Becky. - Why would she lie to me? Why? - I don't know. This is insane, okay! Look, you know me better than that. You know I wouldn't do it. You know it. All right, just calm down, all right. It's gonna be okay. All right, I love you. - You love me? You love me? You tried to kill me twice tonight, and you wanna bring up love. Here's your fucking love. Love. Love, love, love is shit! Shit, it's bullshit. Love is shit. There is no fucking such thing as love, okay! (hard breathing) - I do love you. - You love me. No, no, you don't love me. As a matter of fact, I bet you fucked that whore before you even brought her home to me tonight, didn't you? - Whoa, whoa, no, you know that never-- - You did! - No. - You fucking did. - That didn't happen. - Yeah, I can tell. - No, stop it! - What's the matter, Charles? - Don't you ever accuse me of cheating on you. - Oh, am I pushing your buttons? - Never accuse me of cheating on you. - Fuck you. Fuck you! - No, no, no, fuck you! - Don't you fucking walk away from me! You get your ass back here! Fuck you, don't you walk away from me, you bastard. - This is bullshit. I can't believe you'd even accuse me of that. (exhaling) I'm tired of fighting. We can't talk. Everything I say is misconstrued. You don't listen. - Oh, I don't listen? I'm tired of trying to listen. We go round and round and round and round, and nothing ever fucking changes. - I can't take this anymore. - I've tried, but. - So why have you stayed? (inhaling and exhaling) - For Becky. - That's it? So I guess it's over then. - It's been over. - [Charles] You believe that? - I know that. I should have agreed with you outside, earlier. - What are you talking about? - I've been thinking about leaving too. - Why, because of the arguments? (scoffing) What? What is it? Talk to me. - I just don't, I don't feel it anymore. I don't feel the same way I used to. I don't love you anymore, Charles, and I haven't for ... a very long time. I, I didn't, I didn't know how to say it. - Don't talk to me, all right? - I'm gonna leave, okay? I'll find a place to stay on my own. And ... I'll leave. - You're leaving me? - What the hell else are we talking about? - First you accuse me of cheating, then you call me a bastard, and now you tell me that you've been lying to me all along, you didn't ever love me at all? - No, no. I did. But enough fighting will tear that right down, okay. - I'm not gonna let you go. - You're not gonna let me go? Are you joking? You're the one who brought up leaving in the first place. - I know. I was speaking in anger. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. You and I both know it's been over for a long time. - I'm not gonna let it end like this. - Just let it go, Charles. You know. - Don't do this to me. You don't love me? That's bullshit. I know it's bullshit. - Put the gun down, Charles. What, are you gonna shoot me? Good, go ahead. Come on. Do it, right here. Give it to me. Now you're chickenshit? Here, right here. Pull the trigger, baby. Yeah. (soft dramatic music) - What are you smiling about? - I didn't say anything. (hard breathing) - You're smirking. - Am I? Just do it. Pull the trigger, get it over with. (hard breathing) - You bitch. You were gonna let me kill you. - That's what you wanted. - You wouldn't even put up a fight, and you were gonna let me kill you. How could you do that to me? - You're being a bit melodramatic now. - You been putting up a fight all your goddam life, and you're gonna just stand there and let me shoot you? - Charles. - Don't Charles me! You love me. I know it. You were gonna let me kill you. - You're being ridiculous. - Why can't you just admit that you love me? - I'm not listening to this, Charles. I'm not. - Don't you walk away from me. - Don't you lay your hands on me. Don't you fucking touch me. You make me sick. - Just admit it. (knocking on door) - Are you expecting someone? Maybe another one of your little whores. - Shut up. - Why? So you can go fuck her? (knocking on door) - [Officer] Police. Please open up. - Fuck, maybe you oughta invite them in, and we can tell them about all the little whores you been fucking. - This is not a time to fuck around, okay. I got a dead body in here. - Better yet, I think we should bring them in, introduce them to the hostage, our little pet, and then show them all the little dead bodies we've got strewn all over the house. - Shut up. - What do you think? - Listen, listen, take it easy. We gotta take care of this, okay. It's not time for our fucking personal problems. We got fucking cops outside. - You're right. We do need to take care of it. I'm gonna open the door. - Listen, Deborah, no, Deborah. Listen. - Don't. - For Becky's sake, keep your goddam mouth shut. - Fine, sh. - Sir. - Sorry, I was dozing. - We had a few calls from some neighbors about some fighting. - Fighting? No, no fighting here. - [Officer] So there have been no problems here? - No, I mean my wife and I had a little argument earlier, but we weren't fighting. - Is your wife home? - Yeah. - Can we see her? - Sure. Deborah, could you come to the door please? Hey, listen, there's not a law against arguing, is there? - We just have to check and make sure everyone is safe. - Okay, makes sense. - Is there a problem? - [Officer] We had a few phone calls from some neighbors about some fighting. - [Deborah] Really? - You okay? - He has very bad back spasms. Stabbing pain runs up and down his body. It's, you know, are you okay, honey? - Yeah, I'm sure it'll pass. - Have you been fighting? - Fighting? No. Well, we had a little argument earlier, but other than that, no, nothing serious. - And you're okay, nothing physical? - Physical, oh, no no, Charles would never hurt me. Would you, honey? - Of course I wouldn't. - So, if there's nothing else, my daughter's sick and I'd really like to get back to her. - You're both sure, everything's okay? - Absolutely. - Positive. - All right, but keep the arguing down, because I don't wanna be back out here again tonight. - No problem, Officer. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - You have a great night. (struggling) - Don't move. - Don't flinch. You shoot me, and this knife is gonna go through you like a saw. (groaning) - Are they gone? - How am I supposed to know? - Take this knife outta my leg. - Take the gun outta my face. (grunting) (hard breathing) - They're gone. They're gone. - So what are we gonna do now? - You're gonna take the knife outta my leg. (chuckling) - You and I, we're done. - Oh yeah. - So is this how it's gonna end? - Seems a little too easy, doesn't it? - Much too easy. - I'll give you a five-minute start. - Five minutes, five minutes it is. Which way are you headed? - The bedroom. - Don't wake up Becky. (groaning) Need any help with that? - Look, your five minutes are ticking. - Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. Don't bother pointing that at me. - What makes you think I won't shoot you right now? - Because that would take all the phone outta the game. (soft dramatic music) - That son of a bitch thinks he can kill me. What do you think about that, my little pet, huh? Fucker thinks he's gonna leave me. Thinks he's better than me, God dammit. (Kris shrieking) Shut up! You shut your fucking mouth! Right now, shut up! Keep your fucking mouth shut! Do you hear me? (Kris shrieking) Shut it! Did he fuck you? - No. - Did he fuck you? - No, no. - Do you swear? - Yes. - Then prove it. Prove yourself to me. Come on, you know how. Prove it. Now. Pathetic. It's too bad. I'll be sorry to lose you. - Are you gonna kill me now? - I'm not sure. I'm not sure. That depends on you, my little sweet. Here, come on, up. Up ... now. (sobbing) You're gonna give me a little help. Look out, walk. (soft dramatic music) - Daddy? Daddy? - You should be sleeping. - Why are you and Mom fighting? - Why did you tell her that I hurt you? - I didn't tell her anything. - Please don't lie to me, Becky. - But, Daddy, I didn't tell Mom you hurt me. - Mom said you told her that I, that I touched you in bad places. - No I didn't, Daddy. You would never hurt me. - Unlike your mother. - I love you, Daddy. I would never say anything bad about you. - I don't know if I believe you. - But, Daddy, I love you. - I'm leaving you tonight. - No, Daddy, don't go, please. - Becky. - Don't leave. - Becky, stop. - Daddy, no. - Stop, Becky. - Daddy, please. No, Daddy, don't go, please. Don't leave, Daddy, please. (whimpering) - Do you see him, do you see him? - No. No. (soft dramatic music) (whimpering) - [Charles] Deborah? Deborah, where are you? - [Deborah] Are you ready to do this? - [Charles] There's been a change of plans. - What are you talking about? - [Charles] I have Becky. I'm tired of the lying, Deborah, I'm tired of it all. (soft dramatic music) - Let her go, Charles. - [Charles] No, I'm done. And you're not gonna hurt her anymore. - You leave her outta this, Charles. Becky, baby. Honey, are you okay? Becky? Shut up. Charles, if you hurt her, I swear to God, I'm gonna make you suffer. Answer me, Charles. Where is she? Where is my baby? (Kris whimpering) - [Charles] Shit, where'd she go? (hand slapping) (groaning) (fists striking) (groaning) (straining) (dramatic music) (fists striking) - Kris, honey, come here, my little pet. I want you to help me with something. Kris? Kris! (groaning) - God dammit. - This is fucked up. (groaning) The pet's escaped, she's gone. Stop. - Shit. - Fuck. (groaning) - Get the fuck off me. (groaning) - That hurt, you fuck. (moaning) (whimpering) (hard breathing) - Help! (screaming) (crying) She's dead! * Lullaby, don't you cry - Shut up! * Go to sleep - Shut up, she's fine! Becky is fine! * When you close your eyes - No! No, she's dead. - She's not dead. Let me kill her. - We kill her together. (groaning) - Oh. Mm. - That was incredible. - I know. Stupid bitch got everything she deserved. (chuckling) (moaning) - How's Becky? - She's fine. She's just fine. - That was good. - (laughs) That was great. Oh. - Just like old times. - Yeah. You remember your first girlfriend? What was her name? - Rhonda? - Oh, Rhonda, uh-huh. Oh, you slept with me and then you felt guilty for cheating. - Yeah. - Yeah, oh. Boy, she sure did scream when I smashed her head into the counter, didn't she? - I thought old Rhonda was dead, right then and there. - Yeah, but she wasn't (laughs). Oh. - No, she wasn't. We spent hours on her. - Mm-hm. Oh. - Deborah? - Yeah? - Do you think we can work this out? - Why? Why would I want to? (flesh tearing) (groaning) - You bitch. - Oh, I'm just getting warmed up. Oh! (groaning) Oh, shit. (groaning) Son of a bitch. (groaning) Oh. Oh. (groaning) (hard breathing) (gun cocking) (gun firing) Shit. (hard breathing) (groaning) (soft dramatic music) - Ah. (groaning) (groaning) (hard breathing) (soft dramatic music) (moaning) (hard breathing) (soft dramatic music) (hard breathing) - [Deborah] So this is how it ends? (gun firing) (groaning) Oh God. (soft dramatic music) - Touche. (groaning) - Where's the gun? - Right here. - Just give it up. - Never. (groaning) (soft dramatic music) - I never thought it would end this way. - You knew it would end this way. (hard breathing) - You mean with a gun in my hands? I never saw that. - Yeah, I see what you mean. I figured you woulda poisoned me. (crying) - You know me too well. - Uh-huh. (soft music) You were always so good about that. - About what? (soft music) - About knowing me. You ... you were the only man that ever really knew me. - I guess that's why we stayed together so long. - Yeah. We were good, huh? (soft piano music) We were really, really good. - What about Becky? - Becky. Becky's, Becky's dead. (groaning) - Did you really ever stop loving me? - No. No, I didn't. No, I, I still love you. I just can't live with you. - I love you too. (groaning) (upbeat music) * In the midnight hour * Crimson flowers wilt and hang their heads * * But I remember when we loved * To drink the blood we bled * Two sharp knives, we pierced the flesh * * And planted seeds inside * We schemed to take this crazy world * * And skin it of its hide * Love is pain * And life is death * Ironic, so it goes * That blood and roses, wine and flesh don't make * * The garden grow * Killing's a bitch * And this bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * Remember back when we were young * * How we killed without shame * Nothing brings two lovers closer * * Than dishing out some pain * A murder here, a murder there * * My poison blade, her hand * An endless honeymoon we spent * * Dancing with the dead * Love is pain and life is death * * Ironic, so it goes and blood and roses, * * Wine and flesh don't make * The garden grow * Killing's a bitch * And this bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * If you think for a second you can get out now, * * Squeeze through a loophole in our vows * * While saying that you still love me * * And slide a knife into my back * * Or poison me to heart attack * Our skeletons in the closet * There's no way out when love has died * * What good, you can't hide (upbeat music) * In the midnight hour, crimson flowers * * Wilt and hang their heads * But I remember when we loved to drink the blood we bled * * Two sharp knives, we pierced * The flesh * We schemed to take this crazy world * * And skin it of its hide * Now that love has died, there's nowhere left to hide * * Life is pain and love is death * * Love is pain and life is death * * Ironic, so it goes that blood and roses, * * Wine and flesh don't make the garden grow * * Killing's a bitch * And this bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * This bitch is killing me * This is bitch killing me
