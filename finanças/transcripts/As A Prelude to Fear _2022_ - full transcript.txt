[dramatic music] [eerie music] [ominous music] [rock thudding] [ominous music] [door creaking] [woman panting] [foreboding music] [floor creaking] [sinister music] - I knocked something off the bed. I'm sorry. It was an accident. [woman yelping] [woman gasping] [eerie music] I'm sorry. I just fell over. I will never do it again. I promise. [man heavily breathing] I promise. I'm sorry. I just want to be at home again. [woman crying] [man heavily breathing] [knife clinking] [eerie music] [music intensifying] [knife slicing] [woman groaning] [woman crying] [unsettling music] [woman sobbing] [woman gasping] [melancholy music] [dramatic music] [pleasant tempo music] [dramatic tempo music] - So what, we're here? - Looks like it. - Well, could you not meet him in his studio? - I could have but he said he's had problems with his students before, he wants to check me out first. - What kind of problems? - Stop worrying. I did exactly the same thing with you when we first met, remember? - Yeah, well do you not think it's a little bit dangerous? - Look, this is a great opportunity for me and he sounds like the perfect teacher. He was at the philharmonic, he said he's trained loads of students at the Royal Academy, plus, he's local. - So he wants to meet you in this cafe? - And if I'm okay, he's gonna give me a free assessment. That's great, isn't it? We're gonna go through Bach's "Cello Suite No. 1 Prélude" and if he thinks I'm good enough, he's gonna take me on. - You know you're good enough. - I'm gonna be late. Wish me luck, love you. - Good luck. And you know I love you too. I'll see you later tonight, okay? [birds chirping] [entry bell ringing] [faint radio pop music] - Hi. Can I get you anything? Tea, coffee? - I'm just waiting for someone. - Shout if you need anything. [phone ringing] Hello? Ms. Taylor? There's a telephone call for you. [faint radio pop music] - Hello? Yes, it is. Oh, yes, I know exactly where it is, it's just around the corner. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. Okay, thanks, bye. Thanks. - Thanks, come again. [entry bell ringing] Customers like these, no wonder were going bust. [dramatic string music] [eerie music] [dramatic string music] - Hello? Hello, is anyone here? [phone beeping] [Eve screaming] [intense music] [phone ringing] [eerie music] - Hey. Eve. Hello? Eve, can you hear me? Eve? Eve? Eve? Eve? [phone beeping] [dramatic music] [phone busy signal beeping] [somber cello music] - Stop! [ominous tempo music] You did it again. It's unbelievable. You are not concentrating, are you? I know you can do it right. Stop thinking about whatever dribble you saw on TV last night, or dreaming about some dirty boy. Your parents are paying me to turn you into something resembling a cellist and I don't want to be accused of taking money under false pretenses. So, we will try it again, and then again, if necessary, until you get it right! Understood? Well? Do I make myself perfectly clear? - Yes, Mr. Corcoran. I'm sorry. [pleasant cello music] [music eerily distorting] [ominous tempo music] - Hello? Hello? [eerie music] [Eve knocking] Hello? [Eve knocking] Hello? Hello! Hello? Someone help me! Hello? Is anybody there? - [Man] Eve. [intense music] [man heavily breathing] - Who is it? [man heavily breathing] Why am I here, what do you want? Is this some kind of joke? [man heavily breathing] Let me go. Let me go, I want to go home! [man heavily breathing] You can't keep me here, I want, I want to go! You have to let me go! - [Man] No one is coming to rescue you, Eve. - No, let me go. Open this door now! - [Man] Just be calm, Eve, and you won't be harmed. - What the hell do you mean? What the hell are you talking about? Are you insane? Let me go. Let me go! [man heavily breathing] Let me go. Let me go! Let me go! Come back, please! Please! [Eve crying] [ominous music] Let me go! You can't keep me here, you're mad! [music intensifying] [somber tempo music] - Jamie Harris? - Yeah? - I'm Detective Inspector Dobson. You're here to talk about your girlfriend, Eve Taylor? - Yeah, look, I told the police yesterday that she went missing and you've done nothing about it. - It's just procedure, Mr. Harris. We have to make sure we have all the details. - I told them everything yesterday. - I understand that, Mr. Harris, but we do have to go through this one more time. - Yeah, it's procedure, right? Look, just get on with it. - When was the last time you saw Ms. Taylor? - Yesterday morning, the Horton Cafe. - Why was she there? - Oh, she was meeting her new music teacher. - Male, female, name? - Male. I don't know his name. - Did she know him before? Did they have some kind of friendship or anything that you knew of? - What? No. Look, I know where you're going with this and this has nothing to do with me. It's not like she left me for another man. - You're absolutely sure there's no possibility. - No, there's no argument, okay? No other man, all right? She's gone missing. It's completely unlike her and I just want you to do your job and find her. - I can assure you, Mr. Harris, we've got our best people on this. - And the chance of finding her alive? - Try not to worry. Most missing persons do come home. Now this music teacher she went to see, what instrument does she play? - Cello. - A cello teacher? - Is that important? - No, not at all. I assure you, I'm taking this straight to our superintendent. - And his name? - Barnbrook. Detective Chief Superintendent Barnbrook. [dramatic tempo music] [door knocking] - Come in. - Morning, sir. - Morning, Sam, what have you got? - Not a lot of actual evidence, sir, but quite an interesting theory. - Oh, Christ, all right, let's hear it. - Well, there's a lot of similarities between this missing girl and the Homeswood case. No bodies, no clues. That's why the papers called it "The Pied Piper Case". - Well look, what we're dealing with here is one missing girl. - One of the other common factors in the two cases is that this new missing girl was also having cello lessons. - Was she? Who from? - Mr. Corcoran, sir. - Giles Corcoran. - Sorry, sir, I realize this must be painful for you. - Why would it be painful for me, eh? Could it be because it nearly derailed my whole career? You must know what happened. I was crucified. - Maybe if you haven't been quite so visible. - Yeah, you're quite right, Sam. If I hadn't been on the telly every other night telling the whole world how confident I was that I'd soon nab him. Just needed the evidence. I was convinced he would slip up, but no, he never did. [gentle string music] If I do decide to pursue this line of inquiry, I want you to keep totally shtum. I don't want the press to get a whiff of it. So if I open my newspaper in the morning and see headlines proclaiming the return of the Pied Piper, I will not be an happy man. [somber cello music] [small dog barking] [ominous tempo music] [dog squealing] [dog whimpering] - Stop it! Stop it, what are you doing, stop it! What did you do to my dog? [dog barking] What did you do to my dog? - This is my last warning. If I catch that animal rooting around in my garden once more, you'll be able to use it as a hearth rug. Do I make myself clear? Fix that fucking fence, woman. - Oh, that's an awful thing to say! You're just a cruel, hateful man! Come, come, my pet. [ominous tempo music] [Eve crying] - [Woman] It gets easier, you know. You become numb. - Who are you? Could you help me get me out of here? - [Woman] How can I do that? I'm not free myself. I'm not even supposed to talk to you. If we talk, we get punished. - Look, this guy's insane, we have to get out of here. - [Woman] Forget it. If you try, he'll kill you. - If we work together, we'll have a better chance. - [Woman] Please! Just stop it. It's not possible. Your name's Eve? - Yes. - [Woman] It's not just us here. There's another girl here too... but she won't speak. - Oh my gosh, you mean there are three of us down here? He's a psycho, isn't he? - [Woman] You'll realize soon enough. He hasn't told you the rules yet. - Rules? - [Woman] He will leave you alone for a bit. He always does. We can't speak anymore. If he catches us, he will hurt us. - How many days have you been here? - [Woman] Days? I've been here about 14 years. [sinister music] [Eve crying] I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have told you. - Why me? Why me? - [Woman] Once you resign yourself it gets a bit better. You're the replacement for the last girl, Sarah. She wasn't here as long as us. About five years, I think. Sarah Andrews. - [Eve] Sarah? What happened to her? - [Woman] I can't tell you. - [Eve] What happened to her? - [Woman] You don't want to know. - [Eve] Tell me! - [Woman] Keep your voice down. We can only talk when he's out or when he's playing. [floor creaking] He's coming. [floor creaking] [bucket clanking] - [Man] Eve. [intense music] [man exhaling] - What are you staring at? Listen, you have to let me go. I've got a boyfriend, he'll be worried sick. Talk to me. - [Man] It's time for your first lesson. - [Eve] I'm not doing anything you say. - [Man] You will keep quiet and never talk to the other girls. - Why should I obey you? You don't want someone like me around here, I never do what I'm told. It's not school. [man exhaling] - [Man] Do not touch it until I get back. [man exhaling] - Fuck you. [Eve groaning] [ominous music] [Eve gagging] [music intensifying] - [Man] Drink from the cup. If you don't, you will die. [ominous music] [Eve huffing] [door knocking] - [Barnbrook] Come in. - I've got the up to date information you wanted on Mr. Corcoran, sir. - Well done, Sam, that was quick. - Right, well it seems he left his last job at Homeswood a few months after the last girl disappeared. - Did he now? - Although he was never charged, he was always in the frame. And the papers weren't very kind to him either. - Yeah, well they were only telling the truth. His links to all three missing girls was an inescapable fact. - Bit of a nomad it seems. Moved out of the immediate area and he's renting in Waterbury. The estate agents say he's been there for about six months. They also say he's used them about four or five times in the last 10 years. They think he's used other firms to move to other locations. - Yeah, his past catching up with him, you see? Yeah. I'm not the only one who thinks he's the Pied Piper, you know? What's he been living on? - Must be his music lessons keeping him afloat. Although he teaches cello and violin, I can't imagine he gets that many punters. - Should have taken up electric guitar. - We did hear a rumor he's got some kind of inheritance but we have nothing firm on that. - It seems to me, Sam, that every time he chooses a new neighborhood, someone recognizes him and he has to up sticks. - Yeah. Amazing, really, after all this time. Although his face was plastered all over the papers, he had it worse than you. - Oh, the difference being I didn't kill anyone! I spent quite a lot of time with that man. There were three separate investigations, you know. And we got to know each other quite well and he knew that I knew he'd done it! But he let me know with his face and his tone of voice and his supercilious attitude. Laughing at me, he was. All right, you know I've done it, let's see you prove it. Typical of his type. Arty-farty public school dropout. Ex-hippie, probably. I know he had a conviction for possession back in the seventies. Couldn't make it as a musician, ends up teaching fiddle at some second rate girl school. He's gone too far this time. - This is getting a bit personal, isn't it, sir? - Personal? Personal, Sam? Someone snuffs out the lives of four beautiful, promising young girls and then laughs in my face! You tell me what man wouldn't take that a bit personally! Well... [lively tempo music] first thing tomorrow, we're gonna have a few words with that bastard. [foreboding music] [eerie music] [melancholy cello music] [Eve groaning] [melancholy cello music] - Ah. [Eve huffing] - [Woman] Are you okay? - Just about. - [Woman] You would've died if you hadn't taken the antidote. - He's a sick fuck. - [Woman] You shouldn't resist him. He doesn't care about how much pain he dishes out. And one way or the other, he will break you. - Should you even be talking to me? [Eve groaning] - [Woman] Don't try to move. The pain will go in time. Are you a musician? - Yes. I'm a cellist. Why? - [Woman] That was him earlier, you know. He plays so beautifully. - That's why I'm here? I thought he'd be teaching me. - [Woman] All that beauty, but when the music stops... - Then he hurts you. Oh, you sick bastard. - [Woman] Once you conform, it's mostly not too bad. If you do everything he wants. - Who is he? - [Woman] He lives this double life. I've heard him talking to people and guests upstairs. He's like a different person. Even his voice changes when he's down here with us. I don't know how to describe it. - Duel personality. Like Jekyll and Hyde. - [Woman] Yeah. He lives his normal life and then all this. I'm not sure if that's why he wears the mask or just to hide his identity in case one of us ever escaped. We've never seen his face. - Alex, you mentioned a girl before me. - [Alex] Yes. She ripped his mask off when she first arrived. He went crazy and started beating her over and over. - Did she die then? - [Alex] No, but nearly. She was more like you, stubborn. But in the end, she pretended to give in. I think she was biding her time. Every now and then, he would take us upstairs. Not very often but sometimes. And when he wasn't looking, Sarah stole the odd thing. Paper, pens, spoons. I saw her taking a piece of rope once. - Why? - [Alex] I could hear her scraping, making something, writing the details down. She never told me what she was doing. Maybe she thought I would tell him. I don't know. - [Eve] What do you think she was doing? - [Alex] A weapon. I think she was making a makeshift weapon. I think she hid it somewhere and was going to try and kill him but... Well, he killed her first. He seemed different that day. As if he thought killing her was something she wanted. I don't think he cares about death. - How often does he go out? - Sometimes he leaves the house for days. He just leaves a pile of food for us. We think he's probably got another home somewhere else. We don't want him here. But when he is away, it's a bit scary as well. We depend on him for our food and water. If something happens to him while he's away, an accident or something, even if he just decided not to return or the police caught him, well, if he doesn't come back, we're all dead. [eerie music] - [Eve] My God. - [Alex] The hard fact is, we depend on the monster returning to the lair. - I just wonder if I can survive this. - [Alex] It's not about survival. It's about acceptance. Once you realize that, it will get easier. - No. No, I'm not like that. I'm scared, but I'll keep on fighting. - [Alex] Everyone does in the beginning. When I was a kid, they told me there was no such thing as monsters, but there are. [eerie tempo music] [ominous music] [door thudding] [floor creaking] - [Girl] No, leave me alone. Please, don't hurt me, please! Please, don't hurt me, ah! I've done everything right, ah! Please. [girl crying] No! [hit thudding] Oh! [hit thudding] [girl crying] [hit thudding] - Will she be okay? - [Alex] I hope so. Sometimes I think he will kill her. - God, no. [girl crying] - [Alex] I wish he didn't beat her so. - I can't take this. It makes me sick. [girl crying] Are you sure she'll be all right? - [Alex] Sometimes the only comfort comes knowing that it didn't happen to you. - How can you live like this? Don't you remember life outside? Don't you want out of this? - [Alex] Please, Eve, don't talk about it. I don't want to know. [girl crying] - I don't understand. This is a living hell. - [Alex] Please, Eve. Just... Don't. [girl crying] [dramatic music] [somber tempo music] [doorbell buzzing] - Yeah? - Are you Mr. Cox, Mr. Robert Cox? - What do you want? - I'm trying to find the identity of the Pied Piper and I've been told you might know something. It's my girlfriend. I'm trying to trace her. And if you do know anything, then I'd be really grateful for your help. - You better come in. [dramatic music] - I'm sorry to hear about your girlfriend. Eve, did you say? - Yeah. Yeah, Eve. She played the cello... and she had this... she had this lesson with this music teacher. I haven't seen her since. - Oh, Christ. - I've looked through all the press coverage online and I came across an article that said you thought that Giles Corcoran was the Pied Piper. - It's that piece of shit Corcoran all right. - What makes you so sure? - Three girls, all cellists, all his pupils and he was the last one to see them alive. - I can't believe this is happening. - That's super copper knows. - What, you mean Superintendent Barnbrook? - Barnbrook, aye. He's the one that named Corcoran on TV. - Yeah, that's still all over social media. I know she's still alive. Nobody's doing anything. I feel so helpless. God, I've got to find her. - There's one major problem here. 'Cause if he's keeping her locked up and the police arrest him... - If he doesn't tell them where she is, she could starve. The police need to catch him red-handed. - That's what I'm saying. Ring that copper now and kick it up the fucking arse! [phone dial beeping] - I need to speak to D.I. Dobson, it's urgent. - Jamie Harris. She knows about the case. [ominous tempo music] D.I. Dobson? It's Jamie Harris. Look, I need to speak to you about Eve Taylor. - I realize you're upset but we are taking this seriously. Mr. Harris, I can assure you, we are looking into every possibility. It's James Harris, Eve Taylor's boyfriend, do you wanna take it? I can tell you Mr. Harris that no other police department will be taking this case as seriously as we are. The chief superintendent is giving this his utmost attention. But like I said, Eve could walk through the door at any moment. The best thing you can do is just wait by the phone and we'll let you know as soon as we hear anything. [Barnbrook clearing throat] [gentle string music] If the Pied Piper case gets out. - It will not be getting out. - Well, hope not, he's threatening to go to the papers. I can sympathize, poor bugger. James Harris, Eve Taylor's boyfriend, sir. Oh, I hope for his sake she does just walk through the door, case closed. - Yeah, well let's hope so. - Oh, by the way, sir, Giles Corcoran, he's coming into the station tomorrow. - Yeah. - Do we know for certain it's him? - Sarah Andrews, Joanne Cox, Alex Jones. He killed them, I'll prove it. Sam. Shut the door, will you? Sit down for a minute. - [Sam] Is there a problem, sir? - No, no, no problem. It's just the end of the day and I thought maybe we could have a chat. Would you mind having a drink with me, Sam? You're off duty. I keep this baby here for special occasions and very bad luck. - Well, if you insist, sir. - There we are. To the best of times and the worst of times. - Absolutely. - I suppose all this might seem... a bit strange, a bit out of character. - Just a bit, sir. - I know you have your doubts about all this. It seems to me there's a different breed of copper out there now, where all this is, it's just another job to them, like working in the supermarket. But for me, all this, this has been my life. Now I know taking this case off you, it can get to you, that kind of thing. Now you look at me now, I used to have a great marriage, I was going places with my career, I was keen to get the job done and right the wrongs. I wouldn't like to see you get obsessed like that. Now how's your bloke, Sam? - Oh, he's fine, thanks, sir. Doesn't seem to mind the long hours. Sometimes, I think he can't wait to get rid of me. - Well, you look after it while you can because one day you might just turn around and find there's nothing left but the job. Don't you end up like me. - I think I'm pretty practical, sir. I don't take these cases too personally. If you don't mind me saying, sir, you talk about the girls being dead but it sounds as if you really wanna believe they're still alive. I really hope they are. I don't know. I love my job but I don't take it home with me. I must be going, sir. [gentle string music] - Don't expect to have another conversation like this. - I won't, sir. [sinister music] [man exhaling] [ominous music] - Alex. Did he drug me? - [Alex] He's coming. Please, Eve, don't cause problems. It will be okay... but you must listen and be attentive. [floor creaking] [door clattering] - Allow me to introduce Eve. [man heavily breathing] [eerie music] And now something so beautiful, so exquisite. Please, play. [eerie tempo music] [somber cello music] [dramatic cello music] [cello note distorting] No! [sinister music] How dare you, Eve. You are capable of so much better. [Eve screaming] [Eve whimpering] [eerie music] [ominous tempo music] Next time, it will be your head. [eerie tempo music] [door thudding] [somber music] - Hello, Mr. Corcoran. - I suppose I should say what a pleasant surprise. But it's not really a surprise... and it's not particularly pleasant. - Why aren't you surprised to see me, sir? - Oh, I knew it wouldn't take you long to discover my connection to poor little Eve. And I knew you wouldn't pass up the opportunity to try and pin something on me. As Eve Taylor has disappeared, you think that I've killed her or maybe I've got her locked away in a shed or a basement somewhere. Well, what do you want to ask me about Eve? - Well, let's start with the last time you saw her. - About the middle of September. - And this was at your home, was it? - Of course. - When was the next lesson scheduled? - It wasn't. - What does that mean? - It means, Detective Chief Superintendent, that Eve Taylor is not my student. That was her one and only lesson. That's all I can tell you. I met her only the once, we had no other contact. I know nothing at all about her. I seem to remember I told you something similar the last time we met, only you didn't believe me. - A very sad state of affairs, Mr. Corcoran, but really, we just followed on where the circumstances seem to indicate we should go. What else should I have done? - Well, perhaps you could have spent more time investigating the other suspects. - Well, you see, there's the thing, unfortunately, there weren't any. And that's one of the things that makes this case almost unique. The eerie similarity between the victims, the manner of their disappearance, the musical link, their connections to you. Now I know that no concrete evidence was found to link you to any of this, but you had the opportunity, you had the means and no alibi. Now I know that coincidences do occur but my experience tells me that they're not near as common as people think. - And my motive? - When it comes to the disappearance of attractive young females, we don't need to look for the rational motive. I don't think we need to trouble you any further today, Mr. Corcoran. If we need to speak to you again, we'll be in touch. But in the meantime, please don't leave the area without letting us know. We need to eliminate you from our inquiries, you see? - You're not planning to eliminate me from your inquiries, are you, Chief Superintendent? You are insanely looking for some evidence that I am the Pied Piper! - I'm dreadfully sorry. - What's next, sir? - Let's check out his neighbors, see if they've noticed anything. - I'm on it. - All right. [Sam knocking] [dog barking] - [Neighbor] Yes, who is it? What do you want? - Sorry to disturb you, it's Detective Sergeant Dobson. Could I have a word? Well it's about your neighbor, Mr. Corcoran. - Dreadful man, absolutely dreadful. - Really? - He was so rude to me just because Bathsheba got into his garden and dug a little hole. - Doesn't like anyone digging up his garden, eh? - Don't know why, it's just a jungle. We did try to be friendly when he first moved in. Several of us went round and asked him if he'd like to join our neighborhood watch scheme. and he told us to... I don't like to use the words. - [Sam] Dear me. - Said he hated snoopers, ha. Well you would, wouldn't you, if you had something to hide. - [Sam] Does he have something to hide? - Well surely you know. - Know what? - He's that man. The one with the three young girls who disappeared. - Ah, that case - They never found the bodies, did they? - Well, you know, he was never charged. - Oh, they never found the proof. - Does he have many visitors? - There's quite a few. He teaches cello and violin and, oh, I'm always asking him to keep the noise down but, of course, he ignores me. Mainly young girls, and he treats them like dirt. Bellows at them when they don't come up to scratch and I've seen several of them leave in tears. - Does he go out a lot? - Quite a bit. Sometimes he stays out overnight, several times a week. - Any idea where he goes? - No, I'm afraid not. But I think it's somewhere in the country because when he gets back, his car is covered with mud. He doesn't clean it for days. - Well, you've been most helpful, Mrs... - Ms. Cordwell. - Ms. Cordwell, thank you very much. [foreboding music] - Corcoran! - What the hell are you doing in my bloody garden? - Eve Taylor. Where is she? I want answers! - Do you? - You're very tough with young girls! Well how about a grown man? Tell me! Where is she? Where is she? - Unless you get out of my garden right now, you are about to find out. [ominous string music] Your choice. - You're not gonna get away with this. Do you hear me? If you've hurt her, I'm gonna kill you! You understand? I'm gonna kill you! [ominous tempo music] [door clanking] [floor creaking] [lock clicking] [bucket clanking] [door thudding] - Have you got a minute, sir? - Yes, Sam, as long as you can tell me you got something we can nail this bastard with. - Afraid not, sir, James Harris is here again, threatening to sue the police. - Oh, just what we need. - We got another bit of bad news as well, I'm afraid. Someone's leaked it to the press that it could be the Pied Piper back again. - Oh, Jesus Fucking Christ! Did I or did I not make it clear? Just sort it out for me, Sam, all right? Just sort it! - Very good, sir, I will do. - Did you speak to the neighbors? - The woman next door remembers several girls coming out in tears. - Did they? - [Sam] Oh, there's something else, sir. - [Barnbrook] What? - I spoke to the landlord at the pub. When he first moved to the area, he used to go in there every night, drank like a fish, used to shout his mouth off. Anyway, one night he started boasting about this cottage he had in Wales. - That could be significant, couldn't it? Here, tell me this, Sam. If you're a villain and you want to get rid of a body somewhere where you can almost guarantee it would never be found, where in the UK would you go? And some of those remote areas is miles after mile after mile of absolutely sod all. Whereabouts in Wales is it? - Well, we think it might have been left by his mother, so I checked the inheritance records under the name Corcoran and, bingo, there it was, complete with address. - Bloody good work, Sam. Do you know what, I reckon we might have him here. And then the moment he goes anywhere near the M5, we'll stake the place out. Yeah, next time he visits the land of our fathers, we're gonna be waiting for him. [gentle music] - Mr. Harris, you are all right? - No! No, I'm really worried about Eve. - I know you are. - Look, I went to see Joanne Cox's uncle and he told me Corcoran's the Pied Piper. He told me it's him. I mean, he kidnapped his niece. So there's every possibility he's got Eve. - You can't just accuse someone. Not yet, not without proof. - Well, I went to see Corcoran, I was fuming! I was just about ready to do some damage. I climbed over his fence into his garden to see what I could find, and he threatened me. - I sympathize with your position, I really do, but that could be construed as threatening behavior on your part. - So he kidnaps my girlfriend and you're gonna arrest me? - Look, Mr. Harris, just go home and get some rest. The superintendent is looking into this personally. - Oh yeah, Barnbrook, yeah, I know about him. He thinks Corcoran's the Pied Piper as well. - Superintendent Barnbrook is making this one of his priorities. - I've had enough, okay, Robert Cox was right! Corcoran is the Pied Piper and you and Barnbrook need to pull your finger out. I mean, she could be trapped somewhere! - We're doing everything we can. - I'm going to the papers and I'm gonna go find her myself. - Mr. Harris, that's not a good idea. - Well, I really don't fucking care. - Mr. Harris, please calm down. - I've given you every opportunity to go and find her. And what have you done? Tell me, what have you done? Nothing! So now it's up to me, isn't it? I'm done with this! - [Announcer] We interrupt this program for a news flash. The man leading the investigation into the disappearance of a music student, Eve Taylor, Detective Superintendent Barnbrook, told a news conference today that he had no information linking the incident to the Pied Piper case over a decade ago. - Fucking Barnbrook! [sinister music] [ominous tempo music] - [Alex] Eve? - Should you be talking to me? - [Alex] Can I ask you something? - Of course. - [Alex] Why do you fight him so much? - I have a life outside. I have a boyfriend, Jamie, he loves me. I love him. I just can't give up. - [Alex] But he will hurt you. - I can't live here for 14 years and I'd rather die than be poured over by that sick creep. - [Alex] He will break you, Eve. He breaks everyone in the end, one way or the other. - No. No, he'll never break me. - [Alex] Not yet. But when you feel his hands all over you, touching you, your body goes numb, your mind switches off. - However hard it is, I won't let him own me. - [Alex] He's having a party for us tonight. He will probably come for you. - I'm not letting him touch me. - [Alex] If you try and stop him, he will just drug you. There's no choice. - If that happens, I'll kill myself. - [Alex] That's what we all thought. [footsteps thumping] [ominous music] He's coming! [floor creaking] [door clanking] [man heavily breathing] - [Man] Tonight is a celebration, Eve. - Why would I care? - [Man] I can make you care. - Leave it alone, you pervert! - [Man] Don't you know I can do as I please? - You disgust me. [Eve gagging] [intense music] - [Man] You need to bond with me. - Never. - [Man] It's up to you. - Fuck off and die. - [Man] Have it your way. You will be nice to me when I leave or I will hurt one of the other girls. [ominous music] - No. No, no. No, please. Please, you can't do that. Don't touch her! - Don't hurt me, please! Please, don't hurt me! - No! [man punching] No, no, leave her alone! - [Man] Have I got through to you at last? [door clanking] - [Eve] Jo, are you okay? - No! Go away! We're not allowed to talk! [Jo crying] - If you wanna talk, I'm here. - [Alex] Just leave her. [Jo crying] - I just feel so bad for her. - [Alex] Don't. It could be you next. [Jo sobbing] [entry bell ringing] - [Waitress] Can I help you, sir? - I'm looking for this girl. - Okay. - Have you seen her? - Yeah, the police have already shown that to me. All I can remember is she didn't even buy a cup of tea. - What, and that's it? - That's it. - Are you sure? I'm really worried about her and the police are doing absolutely nothing to find her. So if you know anything, then please just tell me! - She was on the telephone. And she said where she was going wasn't very far. - Wait, what'd you say? - She was on the telephone and she said where she was going wasn't very far. - And you told the police this, yeah? - I did tell them, they didn't seem that interested. Although, they did buy a couple of jam donuts. - Oh, typical. All right, look, thanks for your help. - It's okay. Tea, coffee, donut? And that's why I'm going bankrupt. [ominous music] - I'm so sorry, Alex. Are you okay? - [Alex] We've been here a long time. We feel nothing now. Nothing. You just learn to live with your pain. - We have to try and escape. If we work together, it's our only way. - [Alex] I don't want to die. I'll live like a slave if the choice is between life and death. [ominous tempo music] [Jo crying] - What's wrong with her? - [Alex] It's where he hit her. He made her pregnant. And he's beating her to get rid of the baby. - Jo, I'm so sorry. You have to be quiet. If he hears you tonight then... - [Jo] It hurts. [Jo crying] - [Alex] You have to be quiet. - It hurts so much. - He will kill you if he hears you again. Quiet, for God's sake! [sinister music] [door clanking] - Who was it? - It was me, I made the sound. [man heavily exhaling] - [Man] You have to be punished, Eve. - No! [eerie music] [gentle string music] [door creaking] [phone ringing] - Hello? Inspector Barnbrook? I've been trying to speak to somebody in charge but I just keep getting palmed off with D.I. Dobson. Cardiff police have a lead? [gentle string music] All right, okay, I'll speak to D.I. Dobson. I can be at the police station in 15 minutes. Thank you. I was beginning to think the police had pretty much given up on me. [eerie music] [Eve gasping] [Eve coughing] - I want control of my life back! [Eve yelling] I despise you! How does it feel to be so hated? Let me go, you monster! - [Man] Eve. [sinister music] You'll keep quiet. - Why're you doing this? - [Man] Just be calm, Eve. - Tell me why! - [Man] Thousands of girls disappear every day. You're just one more, Eve. You are here to stay. - No! No, I will keep fighting you and you'll slip up and you will lose because you are nothing but a loser! [eerie music] - [Man] How dare you speak to me like that. Don't you know what I can do? [Eve gasping] Whatever happens is your fault, Eve. Yours only. [Eve yelping] [man heavily breathing] - Yes, you're right. I'm sorry. [Eve groaning] [eerie music] [man huffing] You disgust me. [knife slicing] - [Man] Whatever happens is your fault, Eve. Yours only. [unsettling music] - Oh, Jamie. No, no! No! [ominous music] Jamie! No! Jamie, no. No! Oh no! [Jamie gasping] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you. [dramatic music] - Eve. [Eve crying] I love you. - Oh I love you, Jamie. Jamie! I love you, Jamie. What did he ever do to you? Why him? [Eve sobbing] [foreboding music] I love you. I love you. [Eve sobbing] You fucking pig! I'm gonna kill you. The police will find you, and when they do, I hope they fucking hang you! [Eve sobbing] [eerie music] I love you. I love you. Oh no! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you. [dramatic music] - There you are, sir, I've been trying to reach you all day. - Bit of personal business, Sam, well? - He sprung the trap. Headed for Wales. I alerted Cardiff, they staked the place out. Anyway, they slipped up and he spotted them. - Oh, Christ! - Yeah, and he's on the run now. - Is he? - Well, that must mean that there's something that he doesn't want us to find, mustn't it? I think we probably got him, Sam. [dramatic string music] - Well, Mr. Corcoran, we didn't expect that. You're under arrest. - Giles Corcoran, you are under arrest for possession and intent to supply. [ominous tempo music] [phone ringing] - Hello, Barnbrook. He what? You're joking. Right. No, understood. No, no, no, no, send him straight back here if you can. All right, yeah, thanks, bye. - What did they say, sir? - Well, I was right, he didn't get far. They soon caught up with him and fetched him back to his cottage, which apparently he doesn't own anymore. Only the barn is his now. So they made him open it up and what did they find? But row upon row of cannabis plants. - No. - It seems Giles Corcoran is some kind of fucking dope dealer. Well, Mr. Corcoran. Violinist, music teacher, horticulturalist, you're full of surprises. Wanna tell us about it? - I inherited the farm. I knew, of course, that drugs were profitable, and voilà. - Where are those girls? - You're delusional. - Where have you buried those girls' bodies? - I really think you should seek professional help, Chief Superintendent. Your endless attempts to try to link me to the Pied Piper will end up by destroying what's left of your brain. [Giles laughing] - Listen to me, you, you supercilious little bastard. Yes, you were molesting them! And when they called a halt to it, you had to get rid of them in case they decided to talk. If not now, then maybe further down the line because you'd always be looking over your shoulder, wouldn't you? I know how maggots operate like you. Now, where are those bodies? - You sad, little man. - You what? I'm fucking sick of this gentlemanly fencing! So now we're gonna try the old fashioned approach. We're all gonna go down to that farm and you're gonna show us where every one of those bodies is buried or by God I'll put my fucking fist through your fucking skull! - Sir, remember, this is being filmed! [Giles laughing] - Would you agree that the same person is responsible for all three disappearances? - Yes, absolutely, so? - I have an alibi. - You had no alibis. We established that at the time. - I produced no alibi. Not quite the same thing. - Why the fuck would you hide an alibi? - I now have a man who is prepared to testify that he was with me at the time of the girl's disappearances. Check mate. If that's all the evidence you have that I'm the Pied Piper, then frankly, you're wasting my time. I imagine I'd only get a suspended sentence for my spot of gardening, especially when I tell the court how I've been persecuted. You know, I think that might make the papers. Yes. Wouldn't that be splendid? You and I, all over the news again, just like old times. [Giles laughing] As they say, watch this space. Goodbye, Superintendent. - Get him out of here. [ominous tempo music] He's done this, Sam, I know he has. I spent years on this case. - Well, we'll know when we check his alibis, won't we? - Ah, now, hold back on that, will you? Just for a day. I've applied for a search warrant on Corcoran's place. We're looking for drugs, aren't we? If it goes wrong, I'll take full responsibility. - Why is that? - Do you remember the woman next door said he didn't like her dog digging in her garden? I think we'll find Eve there. [Sam knocking] [dog barking] - Oh! It's you again. What can I do for you now? - Sorry to disturb you again, Ms. Cordwell, but we're trying to get into Mr. Corcoran's garden but he's not home at the moment. We didn't wanna disturb the neighbors by forced entry. Would it be okay if we came in and climbed over your wall? - I suppose so. - Oh, great, thanks very much. - Why do you want to get into his garden? Do you think something is buried there? - No, no, no, it's just preliminary investigations at the moment, no need for concern. Okay if we go through? - Yes, of course. - Thanks. Excuse us. [camera snapping] - I think we found something. [ominous tempo music] [camera snapping] [phone ringing] - Hello, Barnbrook. Sam, how'd it go? - We found one of the girls, sir. I think it's Sarah Andrews, the third girl to go missing in the Homeswood case. She's buried in Corcoran's garden. - Christ. How long has she been dead? - Days, we're not sure yet. - Days? Are you sure that's not Eve Taylor? - Definitely not, sir. - Hey, have you got Corcoran? - No, he's still at large. There's one more thing, sir. Corcoran had post and it's not for this address. - Sam, can you send that to me? I just wanna look around, you know, have a sniff about. All right, yeah, thanks. Oh, Sam, great job, yeah? - There is hope, sir. - All right, bye. [ominous tempo music] - [Man] You haven't put in a request for handgun for a while, have you, sir? - [Barnbrook] Haven't felt the need for one in a while. Let's hope I don't have to use it. [ominous tempo music] [engine puttering] [foreboding music] [gun cranking] [metal scraping] [door clanking] [door thudding] [ominous music] [floor creaking] [chains rattling] [dramatic string music] [eerie music] [paper rustling] [ominous music] [eerie music] - I thought we had an intruder. But it was you. It was you, wasn't it, Eve? [dramatic music] I told you not to make a sound. Not a sound. Did you think someone would hear you? That's bad. That is bad. [ominous music] [eerie music] [door clanking] - I'm not scared of you anymore. - [Barnbrook] You should be, Eve. You should be. And thanks to my dear friend, Giles Corcoran, no one is coming to rescue you, Eve. [door knocking] - [Officer] It's the police! Mr. Corcoran, please open up! - [Barnbrook] No one will find you... Ever. This is where it ends. [dramatic string music] Tonight, you will play for me a prelude to our final act. - I'm not playing for you again. - [Barnbrook] Really? [Barnbrook heavily exhaling] You will play for me, Eve, or maybe your mother will take the place of your boyfriend. [Eve yelling] [music intensifying] You have disappointed me yet again, Eve. [Eve gasping] You'll never learn to obey. So that's it, Eve. Your fate is decided. [lock clicking] - [Alex] Eve? [dramatic music] I'm so sorry. - Don't worry about me. [sinister music] [Barnbrook groaning] [door clanking] [sinister music] - [Barnbrook] What? [Barnbrook groaning] [eerie music] [dramatic music] - [Sarah] To whoever finds this. If you are reading this then I am probably dead. I've been a prisoner here for five years. Below this building runs a sewer. I've made some tools and hidden them in the brick work. I'm using them to escape and break through the brick but it will take some time. Please use them to get out of this mad house and bring this monster to justice. Yours forever, Sarah Andrews. [Barnbrook groaning] [dramatic music] [police sirens alarming] [dramatic music] - So, Ms. Taylor, you went to a neighbor's house and you called us from there. - Yeah. - And you have no idea who he is but you are sure he's got a gun. - Please... stop him. - [Officer] We will do, miss. - [Radio Officer] We've got the all clear on go, Commander. All teams move in, repeat, all teams move in.
