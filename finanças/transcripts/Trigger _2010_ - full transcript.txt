- A drink while you're waiting, ma'am? - Uh, I'm... I'm fine for now. - Certainly. - Did you pull the horns down? - Yeah, yeah. - Can you put it in the... Can you, uh, go back and just play it with the foley next to it? Well, that's going to have to wait till Tuesday. No. But, you know what, just email me. Yeah, email me... Okay. - Just right there. - Okay. I am so sorry. Oh, shit. I gotta get this. - Uh-huh. - Yeah... No, the dark one... Because the show is sunny enough already. It doesn't need the sunny theme... It's too twee-twee. It's like butterflies and rainbows... I... The dark one... It's not that dark... It's not a dirge... Okay... Good... Yes. This is going on vibrate right now. I've been working as a music adviser for Lifetime in LA, and, they want to rebrand the Canadian version, so I convinced them to send me here for a few days. I could have done the work online, but this way I get the hotel and the flight paid for. You know how it is. - Not really. - Anyway, I'm sorry I was late. I know you hate waiting. We said 6:30, right? - Six o'clock. - Oh, you waited 45 minutes? - I was early. - How early? - It doesn't matter. About 15 minutes. - No. You waited an hour? Something's changed. Back in the day, you wouldn't have waited an hour for anyone. Except maybe your dealer. Aw, give me a hug. You look terrific. - You look terrible. - No, I don't. - And I don't look terrific. - How are you? - Ah-ha. - Oh, I'm afraid I forgot. You hate that question. - Do you want me to ask how you are? - Only if you're interested. - How are you? - Good. Busy. Tired. Hungry. You took a look at the menu? - I had a chance, yeah. - Plus, they'll do up something special for you if you want. I came here a lot the last time I was in town and I got to know the chef. - Can I get you a drink? - Uh, a drink... What do you think? - You drinking? - Um,you? - No, you? - No, but... - But? - No. Um, San Pellegrino, big bottle, lime on the side. Is your lime fresh? - Oh, yes. - Okay, lime on the side, no ice. Thanks. Are you ready to order? - Sure. - Um, is Henry in the kitchen? - Oh, Henry's not here any more. - Oh, no. Where's Henry? - He went to Ultra. - Ugh. We should have gone to Ultra. - But Denise is here and she mentored under him. - Do you still do that quail? - Yes. - Great. I'll have the quail, no starch. Um, organic greens. - Sure. And, um, you? - What's this? - It's the potato soup. It's very delicious. - Just a salad. - We... we have a selection of salads. - Number one. And we can do without this. - So, this thing tonight... - Ah, how embarrassing. - Yeah, I know. - "Women in Rock"... Why not "Women in Labour"? Are they doing a bake sale, too? - It's a tribute. - To who? - To us, for one. And it's a benefit. - Are they giving out medals? I'd rather have the cash. - They want us to do something. - Uh-huh. - They'd like us to do something. I mean, I'm not prepared to do anything. - I'm not sure I'm going. - But you have to go. - No, I don't. - Well, uh... You have to at least go. I mean, we don't have to do something. - I'm not doing anything. - But you have to go. - No, I don't. - No... true... No, you don't have to. It would be nice, though. - Nice for who? - Okay, fine. It's just, you know, I'm... It's happening, and I'm here, and... - You're here because you're working, I thought. - No. I mean, yes, but I planned the work around tonight. I'm here for tonight. - That's nice. - I could have done this work at home. - Home. - What? - LA is home now? - Uh, well, yeah, as much as LA can be. - You and LA. - Silver Lake is nice. Malibu. - You doing any modeling these days? - It wasn't modeling. - Well, what would you call having you picture taken in a magazine to sell clothes? - I wasn't selling clothes. - Well, you weren't wearing much clothing, that's true. - It's ancient history. You know, it was fun, what I remember of it. I was drunk most of the time. I can't believe you're still carrying that around. - I'm not carrying anything around. I'm just catching up. - So, what are you up to? - Not much. - You're good though, right? I'm hearing you're good. - Where are you hearing that? - From Bill. - That asshole. - He says you're in touch. - He still wants to manage me. I have nothing to manage but my cat and my laundry. - He likes Florida. - He's fucking golfing. Can you believe that? - He says you're making new music. - That's Bill's Story. - You're not? - Well, it's not new. What's new? Nothing's new. - It's acoustic, he said. You were always talking about doing that. I'd love to hear it. Do you have a copy with you? - No. - You know, I was thinking about you, because we are looking for some themes for a couple of programs. It's really great money. It's easy. - Themes? - Themes for a couple programs. - Jingles? - No. Themes. Lots of people do it. - And lots of people give blowjobs for crack. - You're reading. - Yep. - You finally learned how. - The Spirituality of Imperfection. Okay. "Okay?" - What? - What do you mean, "Okay"? - What? Nothing. - Nothing? - Yeah. What? - What? Yeah. - Yeah, what? Nothing. - Nothing. - Nothing. Good for you. - Good for me what? - If that stuff works for you. - "That stuff"'? - That Jesus stuff. - Its not "Jesus stuff". - No I didn't- - It's not Billy Graham. - I didn't say that it was. - You might as well have. Just... you know, your attitude. - My attitude? - Your attitude. Yeah. This restaurant. What the fuck is this place? Fucking quail? Fifteen-dollar potato soup? An hour late? - It was 45 minutes. - I thought it was 15. - Well, you said 45. - You said 15 and now you're saying 45. - Because you said 45. - Yeah, it was actually a fucking hour. - You were early. When have you ever been early? It is not my fault you were early. - It's not your fault, no. It's never your fault, just like in London. - Oh, okay. Because you're the one who disappeared. How do you think that made me feel? - Made you feel, made you feel. You, you, you. It's still all you. - Oh, take a look at yourself. - Oh, you're talking to me with your attitude? And your, what, "rebranding the network"? And your, what, $2,000 sweater? How much did that sweater cost? And "I know the chef", laying on the bullshit just like always. Offering me jingle work? Give me a break. I didn't show up here to eat your disrespect for dinner. - So why did you come? - I don't know, maybe because I thought I'd get an apology. - For what? - "For what"? - OK. I'm sorry. - What for? - Whatever you want me to be sorry for. - Let's start with being late and work backwards. - Okay. I'm sorry I was late. - Who is 45 minutes late by accident? - Like you were never late. Like you're perfect. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Shit. - Woo... We're back. - Yep. - So, how's the spirituality going? - Mmm... so-so. I'm pretty good with the imperfection, though. - I'm sorry I was late. - There's a solution. - What? - Get a watch. - Yeah. - Got to wash my hands. - Waiter. - Waiter? Can I have a coffee, please? - Sure. - I know why you're here. - I told you why I'm here. - No, why you're really here. - Why am I really here? - I don't need your help, okay? - My help? - A job or whatever. And don't try to slip any cash in my pocket when I'm not looking. I'm fine. I've got what I need. - What's that? - To do the next right thing and maintain a conscious connection with my higher power, just like the book says. - So, do you pray? - Do I pray? - Get down on your knees and humble yourself before your higher power? - Not with that attitude, I don't. - Maybe... it's different for addicts. - Not really. A drunk is just a messier junkie. - I guess. - Not you, though. You're terminally unique. You don't do meetings? - I do meetings. - But you don't pray? - I'm more of an agnostic than anything else. - Yeah, well, so am I. It's just questioning. Agnostic means "I don't know". Who isn't an agnostic? Who can say they know? - I've met a few. - When did you start to eat like that? - I always ate like this. Like what? - You used to eat like me. - With my fork in my fist like a spear? Or with my hands? - No. You used to switch, like me. - Switch? - Switch. Switch. Like, switch. - Mmm... I never switched. - You switched. - I didn't switch. I was well raised. - You weren't well raised. - Yes, I was, and so were you. Our fathers went to work in their Oldsmobiles every morning. Our mothers stayed home, ironed napkins, and made macaroni casserole. That's the way it was. We just played rock and roll house. At least we were honest about it then. - My mother never ironed our napkins. - No, but your mother made excellent macaroni casserole. - To macaroni casserole. - How about... we agnostics. - We agnostics. - Come with me. - All right. But I'm not doing anything. I said I'm not doing anything. Did you hear me when I said that? I'm not doing anything? - I want to change. - Your clothes? - Yeah. - You look fine. - I look like I work in television. - You do work in television. - I just... I want to change. - But you're not going to wear the $2,000 sweater? You probably bought it just for tonight. - It wasn't $2,000. - One thousand? - No. - Nine hundred. - No. Lend me something. Lend me something. I can wear something of yours. - You want to wear something of mine? - Yeah. We used to do that all the time. Why not? - Hmm... Uh... I wasn't expecting a guest from LA. - I am not "from" LA. I live mere. I'm from here. I'm from down the street, around the corner from you. - Not in a $900 sweater, you're not. - It wasn't $900. - Eight-fifty. Bingo! - I just want to change! - All right. You can say hi to Brian. - You're kidding! - What? - So... - So... - Yeah. So, you're good? - Yeah. - Good. - Yep. - You want some cereal? - No. Thanks. We just had dinner. - Well, I'm going to get back to the novel. - You're writing a novel? - It's more of a memoir, actually. - Oh. - Yeah. It's either going to be called The Average Life of a Magnificent Man, or... The Magnificent Life of an Average Man. - They're both- - Compelling. - Yeah, but don't worry. Either way, it's not going to be full disclosure. You know. - Oh. - Yeah. So no worries. - Oh. - The only thing clean are t-shirts. - I'll just take a t-shirt. - Ah! Ha! Ha! She's still got it! - Stop. - Ah, well, this is not going to work. - What? - Well, we're dressed the same now. - Lots of people wear ironic t-shirts. - Why is The Commodores ironic? - It's just, a band t-shirt is ironic. - But why? - It's... usefulness. - Hmm... I'm going to put on something else. - Here, wear my sweater. - Oh... All right, baby, I'll wear your sweater. She's a brick House She's mighty mighty Commodores. - Yeah. - So it's here. Sweet memories. - Sometimes. She's a brick... house - Brian? - It's comfortable. - Do you love him? - Love is a minefield. Love is a- A battlefield - This is love: I secretly believe that I'm unloveable, and then I meet you. You taught me that you loved me. I loved you because you loved me, but that has nothing to do with you. It's about you loving me. I only love you because I imagine myself unloveable, and you, against all odds, love me. And then, at some point, you do something that makes me think that you don't love me, which I'm more ready to believe than you loving me- because I'm unloveable. So I stop loving you, because I only love you because you love me, and I'm unloveable. - What about the other person? - Who? - The person who loves you. - No, no, it's the same thing. Everybody is doing the same thing. - Why? - Because everybody thinks they're unloveable too. - I'm not unloveable. I am all-loveable. I am the very meaning of loveable. - Oh, yeah. You really believe that? - Hey, just because you're living in the shadows doesn't mean some of us aren't walking in the sunshine. - We block the sunshine to make the shadow. - How Go Ask Alice. - People think that love will complete them, but, see, what people really want isn't to feel complete. What people really want is peace of mind. I used to sit around waiting for it to come tap me on the shoulder: "Hey there! Come with me." For something to descend upon me and lift me out of my shit. But no, I had to do the work, and, you know, the work started when I stopped waiting for someone to love me. - Well, I think you're running away from something. - What? - Ghosts. The future. Ghosts of the future. - Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm going to head. - What is the problem? - Nothing has changed. It's just like yesterday. - Tomorrow was always just yesterday disguised as today. It's all yesterday. Come on. - No, I don't like yesterday. - You were just scared of it. - What were you scared of? - You. - Memo. - Come on. Look, you could either be in the world, or you could be out of the world. You want to be in the world, it's right in there. You want to be out of the world, go home to your apartment and eat cereal with Brian. I don't know how you're going to sell records that way, so... - Records? I didn't know people still sold records. - Whatever. They're downloading. It still involves cash. Come on in. See what the kids are buying. - I don't know... - You're safe with me, baby. I'm loveable enough for both of us. - Aww... But I'm not standing in line. - Okay, I'll go see if I can find somebody. - Sorry. You go ask. - Hey. Are you Vic from Trigger? - Oh, no. Sorry. - Are you sure? - Uh, pretty sure. Vic! - It is! it's Vic from Trigger! - Can I touch the bottom of your shoe? - Oh, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen, up we get. - Vic from Trigger just touched my hand! - Wait. Wait. Would you listen to our band? - Oh, yeah. Oh, a cassette - I've got a CD. Do you want a CD? - Oh, no. Cassettes are good. I like cassettes - Yeah, me too! - Fuck digital. Piss Flap doesn't do digital. - Yo, Piss Flap! Nice. Catchy. - Yep. - Bill Gates can keep his hands off of Piss Flap, okay? - I'll see you... girls later. Come on! - Bye! - Bye. - Well, this is not so bad. - In what way? - We're going to get fucked up. - Woo. Fucked up. The tribes have gathered and the natives are restless. - If this is a tribe then you are the chief. - Aww, Billy. How's it going ihere, asshole? - It's going good. - You look great, Vicky. - Kat. - Hey, Bill. - Hey. - You scouting for talent? - Not this time, no. I'm just talking to Vic. How's Florida? - Uh, it's, uh... kind of like Thunder Bay- hot, and with tourists. - He's fucking golfing. Can you believe it? - You know, it's cheaper than a shrink, and it's less crowded than meetings, so... Boom! - You and Alice Cooper. - Yeah, I know... He's pretty good. I might be better. Look, boys from EMI came to me with it. - Yeah, yeah... - Ball's in your court. - I'm thinking about it. Yeah. - EMI. EMI! EMI! EMI! EMI! - E-M-I! - How's LA? - LA. - Yeah? Staying out of trouble? - Do I look like I'm staying out of trouble? - Yeah, but you were always good at disguises, so... - Don't worry about me. - "Don't worry about me." Keep an eye on her. - Mm-hmm. - Somethings up there. - Yeah. All right. - All right. Mmm! EMI! - Hey. What's up? - Nothing. I dunno. I'm not feeling this scene. - It's not so bad. - You got a little attention. - What? - I saw that kid outside. Oooh, oooh. And the boys from EMI want to meet. - Whatever. - Doesn't take much to wake up your ego. - It's not about my ego. It's just, you know, I've got this music coming out and... I've been asking myself why, you know? Like, what's the point of another song? It's not the music; it's who the music brings together, and that's what we've been looking for. - And your 12 songs of acoustic intro-spec-tion are going to bring the whole world together? - What? No... That's not what I'm saying. - Maybe you should go out there and do one of your new numbers. - What? "Acoustic introspection"? What happened to turn you into such a bitch all of a sudden? - Just don't look for depth in this scene, okay? This is the same superficial shit it always was, only actually it's fucking worse. - Whatever, it's still rock 'n' roll. - Ha! Rock 'n' roll... Rock 'n' roll is a fucking smell. It's a whiff you get and it reminds you of something. It's an odour. - All right, well, let's go smell the band. - All right, people. This is basically a stage area. I'm looking for laminates that say "full access". If I don't see laminates with the words "full access", you're going out front with the regular folk, all right? - We're, um... - Oh, I know, I know. My God, I know, you're Trigger. I'm a huge fan. You made high school less than hell, honestly. I bow down, really. Just, tonight it's business. Guys, I don't see your laminates. Can you please be somewhere else right now? Thank you. Thank you for putting this whole thing together, by the way. - What? - No, um, she just means, um... just for being part of it. - I thought you were on the board. - No. No, no, no. No, um, we're just... We're just here to be here. Happy to be here. - Great. Are you going to perform, or...? - Uh, she's not, but I might. - What? - I mean, she might do something acoustic from her new stuff. - Okay. - She's being a comedian. - No, I'm... I'm definitely going to perform. - Who are you going to perform with? - You can play with Fox Fire. - Perfect. When? - Now. - Now? Okay. Okay. - Great. It's done. All right. Hannah, one half of Trigger is coming towards you. Bow down. Seriously. - Save it for Carole Pope. - I know. - You guys good with that? - Yeah, we're good. - So, uh, we obviously have a very special guest with us tonight. Rock legends, Trigger. Here's a song that you might remember. - What a cunt! Look at her, so fucking full of herself. What a bitch! Doesn't it just twist your fucking tits? You know, you make her look pretty fucking good when it comes down to it. At least she hasn't cashed in all her chips. At least she's still got a fucking job. You and your shame, and your fucking apologies, and your fucking making amends bullshit. - Shut up. - Give over. Give over. It's just a matter of time anyway. Your music sucks, your liver is fucked, and you think you've got another chance? You're dreaming! All those prayers, all those meetings... Where does it get you? Dead. Oooh, that's nice. Thank you, Edmonton! Chicks rule! Those bitches went off! That was like dropping a match in a gas station. What are you doing dropping matches? It wasn't my fault. I can't go in there in these shoes! Well, then take the shoes off! Come on! God damn it, this shit is no fun sober! Ugh! - Piss Flap? Poor kid. - Ugh. All right, I'll take a listen. Ugh. Poor Piss Flap. - It's better than The Shut Ups. - What? We were 14! - We were so lame. - No, no, no. The Shut Ups were pure. The Shut Ups were when we were perfect. - Oh... I'm tired all the time. - Yeah, I know. I never used to get tired. Well, I never slept. I just passed out. - Even if I did get tired, I'd just take a drink or a hit, and click again. Even a nod isn't like being tired. Going into a nod is like the air turning to Jell-O. and an emotional flatline, but it's not like tired. When I get tired now, I feel: "This is probably how normal people feel. This is as close to normal as I'm ever going to get." - Life's too short to get tired. Life... Life is short, but ssss... somethings long. What do they Say? Life... Life is short, but hell is long. Well, that's what my grandmother used to say. - Hell... I don't know if it's long, but it's deep. - Mmm. And dark. Dark and deep. And deep and dark. And deep and dark... Deep. - And dark. - And deep. - I remember in a meeting one time, somebody said: "They opened the gates, and I thought I was getting let into Heaven, but it turned out I was getting let out of Hell." - That's good. - Well, it's all deep and dark, isn't it? - You know what started it for me... the real beginning of the descent? Love. That Scottish guy I met in London when I left the tour. All fucked up and beautiful. Or maybe he was just beautiful because he was fucked up. And he knew how fucked up he was, like I did. Sometimes it was like looking in a mirror. And he'd get that same look in his eyes. I could see what he was doing to himself. And I wanted to help him. More than wanting to party with him, I wanted to help him. And that's what made me think it was love. It was. Doesn't matter how long you know someone. You can give them your heart in a minute. Your soul. And... we did. And we were going to help each other stay clean. And we did for a while, and... I'd slip, and he'd be there to catch me, and... I'd do that for him, too. But then it only took one time. Once. We hit it together. It was a free fall. His uncle had this apartment in Paris, and... the uncle lived in Dubai or some fuck where. And we stayed there for a month, and by the end of it, we didn't talk to anybody but the dealers who came by. We were so bad, one dealer started calling to check on us. And the deeper we got, the more connected we were. And it wasn't the drugs- it wasn't the fuck up that was killing us; it was... the love. I had split myself open from the neck to the waist, pried my ribs apart, and he crawled in, and I... I did the same with him. One inside the other inside the other. We were this one person. This... new organism. It was like we were the mirror, and then we scraped off the back- the stuff that holds the reflection- and... crushed it up and cooked it and shot it... Everything was dead. But the love. And the love was death. And it never made a sound but it was the loudest thing you ever heard. It was over for me. It was the end. I was waking up disappointed I was still alive. And all the time, I had in the back of my head- way deep in the back of my head- me dying meant he would too. So maybe that's what saved me- knowing it was the only thing that would save him. One morning in Paris... the apartment we lived in... was in an alley with another building really close across, so there was only a small amount of time when any sun would get in the room, at this point where the sun would rise just over... the building across on its way to overheard. There'd be this little lick of sun... on the floor. It'd last maybe less than an hour. Most mornings, I'd sit in the corner and wait for it and watch it move across the floor and disappear, but this one time it was... like... it... wasn't moving. Like it was staying there, like it was calling to me, so I... I crawled across the floor toward it, slowly, slowly inward it, and I... I stuck my hand in it. I... just laid my hand on the floor in the sunlight, and my body soaked it in through my hand, and it was like the sunlight went to my brain, like it went straight to my brain, like it... woke me up for a second. Like it burnt out all the shit for a... a minute. And my brain told me: "Go! Or he'll die." And somehow I got up and I... put on some clothes, and I left him sleeping on the sofa, and I left and I got out and I... found the sun and I just started walking toward it, like I was trying to walk into it, thinking: "Go! Go! Go! Go! Or he'll die". And I never went back. - What was his name? Something Scottish? - Mark. - Oh. - Well, he said it in that Scottish way. Mark. - What happened to him? So is that love? Leaving people is love? - It's a kind of love. - Is that what happened to us? See, 'cause to me, love isn't leaving, because... love isn't something that you're in- that's just the love that gets played on the radio. And love isn't something that crawls up inside you- that's the love they make movies about. - What is it, then? - I... I don't know. I mean, I... I don't know. But I know what it isn't. I don't know. Maybe my mother would know. Your mother. They seem to be able to make it work. The mothers, the wives... - Making it work? Is that love? - Making it work? No, that's a song they play on the radio. On those late-night call-in dedication shows. - To the wives. - To the wives everywhere. - Can I ask you a question? - What? - Who do you... pray to? - I don't know... - See, how can you pray if you don't know who you're praying to? - I just... pray to whatever is... keeping those other assholes sober. - Right. You sure this is it? That's what it says on the card. - Whatever. Let's check it out, I guess. - Will you wait for us? - How long? - This long. - I'll wait. - You'd better come back. - Don't worry. We'll be back. Hmm... I don't know... - Yeah, I don't know, either. - I hated high school the first time. - Needed to take 5 years to finish. - Good one. - Let's get out of here. - Hey, hey! Hey! Look what the oat dragged in! - B.B.! Hey, gal! - I didn't think I'd see you here tonight. Hey, Kat! - Hey, BB. - Jesus, girl, you're awful skinny. Must be that LA diet, is it? Bullshit and bottled water? - Good one. You look the same. - Ouch! - No, you look good. - Oh, yeah, right. I'm about 1,000 years old. Shut up. Well, that was quite the performance tonight. - It wasn't me! - Oh, yeah, right. Never was. Me neither. - So, is this the after party? - Oh, well, I guess one of the suits thought it would be rad to get messed up in a high school. I don't know. Looks a bit like Detroit Rock City meets Sweet Sixteen. Look at these kids. Thank God I'm not their age now. I would be dead in a weekend. Hey, let's go to the green room. Come on. All the stalwarts are gathered. - There's a green room. - Yes, there's a green room. Come on. Let's go. Come on. it'll be fun. - Apparently, Jeremy took one look at the high school, and he wouldn't even come up the driveway. - He was probably scared a bully would steal his bicycle. - No, he's upgraded to a scooter now. - Which he rides all winter. Fucking Canadian. - Aren't you Canadian? - I'm a Martian. I'm a Saturnurite. I'm a Plutonian. - Yeah, don't listen to him, honey. He is so Canadian, he probably shits loonies - Veins full of maple syrup- if I could find one. - Beer? - No, no. I'm good. - Oh, she's good, all right. She is very, very good. - Toby played me some of the tracks he engineered for you. Really beautiful. - Oh, it is what it is. - That's the way to go, you know? Scale it way back. .Just you and a piano. Keep it simple. That's right. "Keep it simple, stupid." - I think she sets you off. I do. - Well... maybe I set her off. - Well, you good? - Yeah. - Yeah? You clean? - Yeah. - What about Kat? - Uh, yeah. According to her. - You know, sometimes I think it's easier for junkies. I mean, we've got the threat of jail, right. But... drunks? What do they got to worry about? Just, well, blackouts and cirrhosis. - Well, that's something to worry about. - Let me take you home. - Oh, Kat's got a cab. - No, no. I mean, let me take you... home... with me. - Oh... Oh. - Come on. You're so beautiful. - Eh... Um... Mm... It feels kinda... incest-y. You know? Family... Heh-heh-heh... - Okay, sorry. I couldn't help myself. - That's all right. - Well, maybe later, right? Another time. - Yep. You're the first in line. - Well, I guess it should be no surprise- you can go home with old money bags. - What? Who? - Kat.

They're always seeing stuff on my liver. - Oh, so, what, you're saying your liver is worse than mine? - I know it is. - My liver's like a sponge. - It's supposed to be like a sponge! Mine's like a fucking stone. - I don't think so. - Uh, don't tell me about my liver. - Yeah, well don't tell me about my liver! I think I know my own liver! - Ah, but if you did, you wouldn't need to have a biopsy. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. Everybody's dying. - Oh! I don't care about the destination. I'm more concerned about the velocity. - Here, let me see your eyes. - Why? - Iridology. I see the best iridologist in LA. Uh... Okay. - What? - Well, just look up into that lighting. Oh... - What?

You eat a lot of salt! - I like saliy... - Well, salt.. ...Salt binds the toxins so you can't Sweat them out. That's what's going on with your liver. Do you read labels? - What labels? - Food labels.

It's my rotator cuff. - Is that the thing that you scrape? - Yeah. I'm wrecking my knee, too. You and I we make a grand salute Stare at each other Like lost little birds across the room And I remember the way you looked I learned how to dance But I'd never shown it to you My love Stay for a while While our leaves are still green Please - We played our song. - Our hit. - Our greatest hit. - We Should put it out on EP. - Asingle. - Forty-five. Running out of room All night saying That you're standing alongside gone I know I tried But it's hard sometimes The routes don't take It takes a while And you pull at the strings But they're broken it seems The dance isn't over for me No my love I know I was wrong But you know that you'll always be My love... - Check them out. It's quite a sight. - I always wanted to do that. - You always used to say you wanted to snowshoe. - Yeah. Yeah, and I did. - How was it? - Brutal. Cold. - Well, what did you expect? - Elation. - Ah, well, that's setting the bar a bit high, I think. - But I did, though, feel something like that. Elation. But it was afterwards, sitting at the fire, thinking about having snowshoed. But that's the thing, isn't it? It's not the doing that feels good; it's the having done it. - Yeah, it's the surviving it. - What if the sun doesn't come up? - The sun will come up. - What if the Mayans are right? Calendar stops and it all just ends. - Wasn't that supposed to have already happened? - And the Earth explodes into four flaming orbs. - A flaming orb. - According to the Mayans, four flaming orbs. - Nice. - And it just ends. Everything reduced to balls of ash and melted plastic hurtling through space. What difference does it all make then? All the music, the gigs, the deals... The art, the beauty, the men... Jaeger... Pregnancy tests, bad biopsies... Maybe that's it: there is no everything; just me and my everything. My calendar, my ending. - A flaming orb. - Four flaming orbs. - Okay. Well, that's like four suns, right? - Mm-hmm. - And the sun created the universe, so there you go. You have four brand new universes. - Four universes of fuck up. - And wonder. See, that's what people really want. Wonder; not sex, not more stuff. What they want is wonder. That's... that's what... the new world is: wonder. Four new universes of fuck up... and wonder. It's progress. - It's something. - It's cold. - You want your sweater? - No, you keep it. This is nice. - Yeah. It's nice. - God. - Yeah. This time in between the day and the night The light kills my sense of life So scared I'll turn it on Turn it on turn it on turn it on its dull this dusk this desk this dust My eyes adjust I'll blow out the Name Can you and me remain Changes I've never been good with change I hate it when it all stays the same Caught between the cold and the wave My heart beats up again Once said Words make a world of their own I misread I can? get you back on the phone So tired I'll turn it off turn it off turn it off How's that last week we were whole You're far away And I hardly know Can you and me delay Changes I've never been good with change I hate it when it all stays the same Caught between the gold and the gain Changes I've never been good with change Troubled when it all stays the same I'm caught between this cold and the wave My heart beats up again Are you my trouble Are you my trouble Are you my trouble Trouble Are you my trouble Are you my trouble Are you my trouble
