Hey, shut the fuck up. Dispatch, heading to Brownsville Road school. Check on the west side of the school. No activity. is all clear. Excuse me. Excuse me. Chief, patching the mayor in. Put it through. - This is Alston. - Alston? This is Mayor Wimbly. You saved a lot of those kids, but we need everybody else out or you're out, understood? We can't afford any more casualties. End this. It's not over. How long has it been? It's been 16 fucking hours. Shannon, I think the government's been taking advantage of me. Let's plan our exit strategy. Hey, shut the fuck up. Everybody listen up! Everyone line up in the middle of the gym, on your knees. Quiet down! You're looking for a comment? On or off the record? What'd the mayor say? Word from the mayor is my team stands down. He'll talk as long as it takes. But we don't have that long. Yeah, I agree. And once they realize those kids were the only leverage, this shit's going to go south. So what would you do. If you were me? I'm you, I give us the nod, Let my team clean it up. We'll fix it. Go back inside, business as usual. Mason online over. Go for Miller Miller. Studied the plans. The roof is composed of steel panels, durable, will open for us, will not fall in on the hostages. And the east wall is the place for the blast. Locals won't see it, they'll be trying to get in from the front while we extract from the side. Mason for Rogers. In position, guys. 'Bout to light it up. Mason for Connolly. En route, less than one mike out. - Confirm when landed. - Roger that. This doesn't feel right. - You gotta do something. - Hey, we got orders. You wanted to be here. I fought to have you here. It's what we do. Dispatch, headin' to the extraction zone Eyes on the police chopper flying into the extraction zone. - Delta in position. - Stand by. We are ghosts if this mission is compromised. Prepare to extract on orders. Locked and loaded. Chopper is in blast radius, stand by, wait for my command. Captain, we're exposed. We can't afford to wait. Standing by. Hold. Not clear to engage. We must ensure the existence of our people. And the future of white children. No! Dispatch, headin' back to rendezvous point, all clear here. Clear to engage. Clear to engage. Fuck! I told you we couldn't trust the cops. All you mother fuckers are dead now. Engage, engage, engage! Go, go, go! Aim for camo, watch out for civilians. Can't see shit. Get the fuck outta here. - Fuck! - What the fuck? Enough of this fucking bullshit. Get down, get down, get down! Get up! Get down, get down! The roof's gonna fall! Stay the course. What are you doing? What was that? Sounded like an explosion. Circling back to assist. Get down, get down, get down! Bring it on! Back up, back up. I will shoot them! I will still these hostages! Put them up, motherfucker, you put them up. - Let her go. - Fuck you! Put 'em up! Let her go. Hey, get them outta here! - Everybody out! - Get the fuck out of here. Move! Get out of the gym! Put your hands up! Turn around and walk backwards towards me, fucker. I'll come towards ya. But she's coming with me. You're all coming with me. No! No! I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! Chopper's going down! Chopper's going down! Conner! Conner! Conner! Conner! - Yo, let's go bro. - I ain't late yet. - Yo, what's up man? - Come on. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Goddamn! Get the hell off my car, man! Dude! Jesus Christ! Fuck off me! You don't want to do that, bro. Fuck outta here, white boy, mind your own God damn business. No. You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Shit. - He dead? - Yeah, he's dead. So you okay? You all right, kid? You know what he did, right? Fuck. Yeah, long time ago. - All right, kid, get out, go. - I can't leave you here. Joaquin, get the fuck out of here, now, go, go. I got this, go! Ain't no white man never did me no good like you, man. Get the fuck out of here! Go ahead, do it. Do it. - Do it. - You'll be the first to die. All right, let's do it then. I don't think you wanna do that Connolly. Okay. All right, all right, you got me, you got me. All right, all right. Damn. This brother had value to me. Blood begets blood. Tyrone Pettis. You really want a government body on you? I got six already. Smoke this motherfucker. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no. Nah, wait. Grab Cornell's gun. We're not gonna kill you. We're gonna let you explain why you killed an unarmed Black man. You really gonna let this motherfucker pass? These... are my streets. I know everything that goes on in these streets. Nah. It's not a pass. I got plans for Conner. You got lucky today. - Bullshit. - I'm telling you like it is. just because we haven't made anything stick, doesn't mean we don't know how ruthless Tyrone Pettis is. You take out one of his men. He takes out you. Maybe we should get Chief Alston in here, huh? Why the fuck would I do that? Because you guys don't know what the fuck you're doing. That kid's out there right now and he needs help. He's in danger. He could back up my story. - Go find the kid. - Look, Conner. says you've been under stress, late nights, always taking personal touch with your parolees. The best we got. But even the best slip up. Find Joaquin. Right. Joaquin Smith, right? Yeah. Found him. No. - Damn it! - What happened, Conner? Because your parolee pissed you off. When you confronted him and got jumpy. I tried to save this kid. If that's the truth then you're really fucked. Suspended. Badge and your piece. Fuck both of you. Hey, hey, look who's here, Uncle Pettis. - How you doing today? - Good. What you looking at? I see you looking at that money. - How's those grades? - Good. - Real good? - Yeah, yeah! - All A's. - Yeah, you first. All A's? What about you? - I got like one B and... - One B and all A's? - Yeah. - And you? - All A's. - All A's? I'll... I'll show you my... I'll show you my grades. Here you go. All A's. All A's and one B, I like that. You're gonna change that B to a A, right? - Yeah. - And you? And you? Wait, wait, wait. Who's talking? - I'm talking. - Oh. Thank you. And what are your grades? I'm gonna let you have this and next time I see you, you're gonna have all A's, right? Just keep doing your best. That's what I care about. What you doing, young man? How you doing? - All right, yeah. - Tell me about them grades. - Oh, yes sir, all A's. - All A's? Here you go. - Thank you so much. - Man, thank you, sir. There you go, no, I'm not short-changing you, all A's. I'm hoping that you're gonna do so well and go to college that y'all can loan me some money one day. Yes sir, we'll be looking out for you. All right. Lucifer's left his lair. See what he wants. Fuck you wanna do, white boy? To what do I owe the pleasure? Love what you've done here. Despite the rumors. Well, thank you. Speaking of rumors, um, have you heard what's happening on the Southside? They passin' out fentanyl like suckers. Any plans on addressing that? Knowing what battles to fight and when to fight, that's critical. That's why I'm here. You left a loose end. No. I don't leave loose ends. Apparently, you do. And you did. No loose ends. It's a strategy. Know what battles to fight and when. - It's of critical importance. - I like this. You like what? Two intelligent men, discussing strategy in our city. Re-election this year. I'm expecting a large donation. As always. This motherfucker want? Ride with me. That one right there. No gun, no witnesses. Nope, something doesn't feel right. He asked for you. - Two black coffees. - Thank you. Thank you, darling. He shot a Black kid. I don't know how to help. I need you to work out that debt you owe me. Your little stunt cost me my job today. Consider us even. I get no tangible benefits from you being fired. You need to replace my asset. The supply side of supply and demand. Go fuck yourself. Nah, Big O. Not here. I think we should go talk to Pettis. And say what? That if anything happened to Connolly, we're gonna bury him. Well, it's a little overkill. Why is that every time it comes to going after Pettis, you seem scared? I've never been scared and Pettis isn't stupid. Oh, shit. I'm home, baby. Sorry I'm late. It was a long day at work. That's okay, baby. Did you get the raise? They're going to tell me. Need that money, Conner. I know, baby, I know. Can I come in? - Yep. - You okay? Why are you on the floor? - Just give me a moment, - Okay. - Hey, baby? - Yeah, babe? Oh, we're gonna need that raise. Yeah, I know, baby, I know. I mean we. I know, babe. I mean we. You're pregnant? - Hey! - Baby on board! Wow. - I thought you'd be happy. - No, no, I'm happy. I am happy. - You're happy. - Yes. My God. - Are you happy? - Yeah. Okay. I can't believe we're having a baby. I love you. Love you, baby. You're going to be the best mom ever. I can't believe there's a baby in here. - I know. - Hello, baby. Hello. Hello? Okay. Okay, okay, okay. We can't park here. Seriously, they're gonna kill us. Let's get you something to eat, something healthy. I know great diner. Wait, healthy diner? Bacon and eggs, baby, protein. Okay, bacon and eggs. - Okay. - Get up slowly, honey. Nice and easy. We don't want to take any falls. Yeah, it's fine. You hungry? Yeah, I'm thinking an avocado, one every day. - It's good for brain health. - Where'd you learn that? I read about it, I've read a couple things. I heard some things. Gonna be okay, girl, you gonna be okay, just breathe. - I'm deeply sorry about... - If you don't get your gutter, fake Brooks Brothers ass away from me and my family... Cornell died because of you! And I told him to leave your ass alone. Now! Go! Look at it. You want me to leave with that? I didn't think so. She still mad. So I need you to eat twice as much, baby, 'cause you gotta feed the baby now Okay, I ate plenty. But the thing is you don't deal with some of the morning sickness stuff that I deal with. - So no baby, no say. - Seatbelt. you gotta wear a seatbelt. - Mm-hmm, okay. - No question about it. Don't fight it, white boy. Conner! Don't fight it! Don't fight it! Conner! Conner! Conner! Conner! The fuck? Candace! Candace! Mother... What did you do to my wife? Where is she? Call me on this when you got it. - When I get what? - My money. What money? I tried to discuss it with you like a gentleman earlier, but clearly you needed some additional motivation to hear what I was saying. You terminated Cornell. Cornell was just 25. He brought me about 250 a year. He had at least 20 more years of service. Subtract five years he might have spent in prison, so you owe me, what? Six point two million. What? Lost earnings, Connelly. But to show you that I'm a reasonable businessman, I'm going to discount that amount for inflation and other variable reasons, and we'll just say you owe me, uh, even two million. I don't have 2,000. I know. City pays you shit. What's this? Southside address, what am I supposed to do with this? A treasure map. Find a way to save your wife, Connolly. How much time you think you need? It's noon. I give you till midnight. That's impossible. Have faith, pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Find a way where there is no way. That shit sound familiar? The keys in the glove box. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Fuck! Watch it, asshole! I love you so much. All right, motherfuckers. Shit. Hey, brother. Long time no see. Maybe not long enough. I wouldn't be here if I had a choice. - Move your foot. - I need your help. I said move your foot. I can't do that. You didn't listen to me before. And you know how that ended. Do you remember when Dad died? You were twelve. You found this gun when Mom was packing up his stuff. Yeah. So? You aimed that gun at me. And I told you, "You ever point of gun at me again, I'll break your face." Yeah, but we're not 12 anymore. Get off of me. Get off of me! Get the fuck off me. I couldn't carry you forever. Yeah. I was readjusting. - For how long, Tim? - How long is it supposed to be till I'm okay with shooting those people? I adjusted. You just do. - I'm not you. - That's a good thing. What do you want, Conner? I need two million dollars by midnight. Okay, why didn't you say? Let me just go get my wallet. What the fuck man? Tyrone Pettis. He took Candace. I killed one of his guys. Don't you ever learn? Have you not shot enough people in this life? If you walk away, she dies. She'll die anyway. Not just her. You're gonna be an uncle. Yeah. Yeah. If I have to. Don't fucking wanna. Yeah. All right. We don't have any other family, Timmy. I hope it's a girl. What the fuck'd you do that for? What'd I do that for? You know why. Tell me everything. Hey, all you noon-time rides. There are reports of a parole officer shooting in town, Jackson Police Chief just announced the seizure of all security camera footage in the area. A bold move. He's taking questions now. There are rumors that this seizure is being served without a warrant. - Is that true? - The warrant's on site. Chef Alston, are you aware of the other rumors that you provide a haven for drug dealers in this city? Who said that? Are you aware they also say that the only reason why you have this job is 'cause you milked that hostage situation or you'd still be on a desk, Chief? A lot of people have died on my watch. I will always bear that pain every day. And that pain drives me to protect this city. This city. It's all for you. So you can print that. Chief, you have a comment for the record? Chief, are these allegations true? Chief, comment? That was beautiful. I almost believed that bullshit. Get the fuck out of here, you're cracking me up. Your stunts keep getting bigger and bigger. You fly too close to the sun, you're going to burn your wings and everybody else's in the process. What do you care? You still got your money. Why are you here? Well, I had some family business to take care of and I heard about your little fiasco, so - I want to see the show. - Show's over. We're all watching you, Chief. We're all watching ya. We were badass, Timbo. There's only one team I know that can pull this off. It didn't end the way it started. Everything changed for everybody that night, not just you, Tim. Everybody. We all had to disappear into a city of people. Even if you're right... Oh, shit. - Good to see you, boys. - Cap. You look like shit, LT. - Tim. - Cap. How's Jeremy? He's happy. - He's 20. - Wow. - Say no more. - You all right? - No. - She alive? - Yeah, she's alive. - Where is she? I don't know. But Tyrone Pettis has her. If you sit still, I'll have my guys take the tape off your mouth. Where's Conner? What are you going to do with me? That depends on how resourceful your husband is. - I need your help, please. - When? Tonight. All right. Anybody else know? No one, just us. All right. We get the crew. This is family. Family. Family is overrated. Not this fucking family. Mr. Miller, are you sure you want to be here? Yes. If you want to reach your full potential in life, you need to show up. Understood? Yeah, baby! Tommy says we need to get a MacBook 2018. Nothin' else. Hold on there, darling, hang on. Excuse me, I need to take this. Who's this? Who is it? Damn, girl. Mason? Man, fuck you. Mr. Miller, what are you doing? Showing up. - Where is everyone? - You expected a surprise party? I know you raggedy sons of bitches weren't about to start a party without me. Boom! Conner, my man. Steve! Good to see you, man, you're a sight for sore eyes. Hang in there, we're gonna get her. Steve. - Hi there, Tim. - Long time. - How are you, brother? - Good to see you. Already started this early, man. Come on now, we're gonna need ya. Cappy. - My motherfucking homies. - Yeah. Dwayne. Dwayne. Things never change. CPT. Don't make me bust your ass, Tim. - Good to see you, buddy. - Good to see you. Wassup? Thanks for coming. - Cap. - Did you get we discussed? Let's see it. I pulled city code blueprints of the property. Had a permit issued for the room in the back. So exactly whose property are we looking at and why? Conner. Why don't you tell 'em? This morning, I killed a banger who was beating on one of my parolees. Turns out he was one of Pettis's boys. Shit. Yeah, tell me about it. They got Candace. - We need two mil. - Could be a set up. No, if they wanted me dead, I'd be dead. Look, everything we've done till now has been under the cover of the flag. Even when the Corps wasn't. This ain't that, man. We got no cover. This is outside the law. - You gotta know that. - I'm all in. Last time I felt alive, was the last time we were together. And no, shit didn't end like we wanted, but fuck, when Cap called, that's all I needed. Well, I don't give an aardvark's asshole why we got back together, I'm just glad that we reunited boys. Okay. So what's the plan? At dark, DEA, smash and grab. Back by 2300. Well, you know what? There's only one thing missing, then. We're gonna do all that, we need guns. - Big fucking guns. - Hell yeah, - that's what I'm talking about. - Lots of 'em. Oh, yeah. Get on the motherfucking ground! Get on the mother... Get down! Get down! Don't move. Hey! Watch it! He's getting away! Get him! Put your hands up! Let her go! End of the line, motherfucker. Go ahead, D, say it? - You say it. - Man, I'm redneck as fuck, you know I can't say it. You say it mother fucker. Fine. D-E-motherfucking-A, my nigga. Fuck you! Y'all ain't no police! Can't be! Sure, well you're right. We ain't. Do you know what the fuck we want? You have no idea who you're robbing. - All right, let's go. Come on. - The fuck. Got it. Somebody asked for money? I'm not letting that shit hit the streets. Motherfuckers. Hey. All right, I'll be there in 20. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. That wasn't fine back there, man, what the fuck happened? I'm good bro, I'm good. Hey, hey. What happened? That night... - Does that ever get to you? - What night? - You know what night. - Yeah. I had to make a fucking call, man. I did that. End of story. A lot of people died that night. Yeah, well they would have fucking killed everybody. We saved lives. We saved a lot of fucking lives. Now we move the fuck on. I sent my guys in to die, and now I gotta live with that. You think I don't live with that? You think every day, I don't fucking think about that? Let me tell you something. When everything is on the fucking line and you gotta make a decision between death and death, there are no wrong choices. None. D'you understand? Yeah. Let it go, man. Come on. What the fuck happened here? Fuckin' Pettis. You almost fucked everything up. What did...? Those cats came in there looking like DEA. - How many? - Five. Fuck. See their faces? Was it Pettis? I don't know. He claimed you were ready. I ain't gonna say nothing about nothing. You can trust me. Just shut the fuck up, you're not gonna say anything. Sorry, Danny. Hey, I need some help over here. - You want a hit? - No. I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke that around me. You hear her? Being all prudish and shit? Actually being all pregnant. And shit. Oh yeah? I can respect that. Boy or girl? I don't know. I just found out today. Put that shit out, nigga. You heard she's pregnant. And, aw, mean old gangster Pettis spoiled of your perfect day. - I mean, it's not that perfect. - You mean there's cracks? Behind that white, perfect picket fence? I mean nothing is perfect. We struggle just like everybody else. Conner settles for this low-grade job when I know he's much more. How's that for a role model for my baby? Do you have kids? - Do you have a family? - Streets of my family. My so-called mom left me on a corner shortly after I was born. I'm sorry. - Yeah? - The fuck did you do? - When? - Don't insult me. I told you the Southside, it was off limits. You did. And I'm here, in my office, after hours, mindin' my business wondering why the chief of police is calling me fucking with my high. Don't forget why you're in that office. I helped you get it. I could help you lose it, fucking jerk-off. Well, looks like your man is coming to get his lady. And his baby. How's that for positive role model? Well, I must say, was an honor suiting up with you motherfuckers again. Don't go getting all sappy on us now, Cap. What's the take? 1875, three zeros. Not enough That's all right, that's all right. Just take your cuts, all right? Hey, hey, hey, I'm here for you, man. Not the money. - Start a college fund. - Well, you know, uh, I could use a new single-wide. - I bet you could. - Stare at Becky on the back porch, but tell you what, we're here for you. I love you, brother. You... you missing what's happening over here? I quit my job. We didn't tell you to quit your job. Man, you white boys are crazy. I thought you might be dead. - Put her on. - What? My word isn't solid? No, it's not. If you want your money, prove she's alive. As you wish, cowboy. Say hi. Hello. Baby? We're comin' to get you, baby. - Conner. - Candace! Don't you fucking hurt her! I'll text you the address. You come with any cops, I think you know the deal. Don't you fucking hurt her. So what we gonna do? I'ma get my money and let her go. So you still trust these white boys? - One of them. - Man, he's a snake too. They all snakes and they gonna bite us in the ass if we let him go. We? Us? Motherfucker, this is my operation. And I don't appreciate you questioning me. Lemme ask you a question. - You hungry? - No, sir. Do you want for anything? No. Then when I tell you what the deal is, I don't wanna hear the way it might be. Understood. That's my bad. But I've been riding with you since you started this shit. And I'm gonna tell you like this, if we let these white boys live, none of this shit gonna matter. 'Cause we gonna be upstate. Doing life. And I might not be around to protect you. - You don't have to do that. - You stop being nosy. You were right. Help us. Let us leave, go somewhere where we don't have to look over our shoulder every night. You want me to help you? You're not here because you're stupid. He's not wrong, leaving witnesses would be stupid. But we leave, and there wouldn't be any. There's only one way to guarantee they don't talk. You sure I can't change your mind? No, sir. He has all the leverage and no reason to escalate. - But what if he does? - He won't. Doesn't make sense. Me and Tim got this. All right, you need me, I'm at the ready. All right? Let me know when you have her. I will. Danny Fields is the largest drug dealer on the Southside. This hit was done with power and precision and the fact that they did not take the drugs leads me to believe that it was not their rival. We'll interview Danny when he gets there. Danny's dead. - Fuckin' heart attack. - What? - You didn't use the 'fibs? - He was loaded with drugs. OK. They were dressed as DEA. Talked to the feds, they haven't run anything around here. They scrubbed the walls and the buckets, took a million worth of dope off the streets. So my question is, are we looking to arrest them or commend them? - Any leads? - Nah, they're ghosts. We found two dancers, patrol's bringing them in now. Oh, Christ. This is a waste of time. Get me something real. Something is wrong with Chief. He's stressed. Nah. He's different. I said he's stressed. You hungry? Get me a fish sandwich, man. - Who. - You, nigga! What you mean who? All right. This is that bullshit. I'm going to relieve myself. Let you do the same when I get back. Thanks. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Shit. There's only one way in and out of here. Anybody want to get at me, they better come face to face! This can get ugly. You thought of any names? No, not yet. If it's a boy, I like Tim. That's not bad. Conner Junior, that's not bad either. Girl? Millie. - Grandma. - Yeah. Why didn't you go to Mom's funeral? I was in a dark place. I gotta tell you something, Conner. Don't, don't. Everyone fucks up. Don't worry about it. This may end bad, you're right. But if it does, there's nobody I'd rather go out fighting with. Hey, do you mind stopping up here? I need to take a piss. Yeah. This is Mason. Since you're in town, I need you and your team. We don't work anymore. You know this. Are you sure? A drug house was hit with, uh, military precision, took a lot of money. Like I said, we don't work no more. I would hate for your role in the hostage crisis to be made public. I was trained for war. I fight to win. What does that mean? If it comes down to me or you, it's gonna be me every fucking time. Do you think anybody is gonna believe you over me? Hey, remember one thing. No such thing as off the record, Captain. - Hello? - En route? Hell no, I'm not coming! Becky's here raisin' seven kinds of hell - all over this shit... - ...off the goddamned phone... What? Oh, fuck. Shit. - No! - God damn, I can't hear myself think. Hello, Mason, listen. All right, come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. Better? Let's do this. See a white girl pass by here? Everybody pack up and clock out. - Girl, what's going on? - I don't know. Clock out, now. Oh, yes sir. You're fucking pregnant. I don't want to hurt you, but I will. This is what a nigga gets for trying to be nice to a bitch. I'm here to see Tyrone Pettis. I got his money. - Two clicks out. - Aye, aye. I didn't want to activate the tracker on Connolly, but, I can't leave a soldier behind. Are you ready? - Let's go get her. - Let's do it. Yo, take their straps, man. - Get the bags. Let's go. - Come on, this way. All right, I'm here. Where's my wife? Shh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Haiti hasn't beaten the US in football in 20 years. But back to business. Count it. The deal is once I get my two million, you get to see her. That's after the count is confirmed. I wanna see her right now. You don't make fucking demands to me! I will have you both killed where you stand. Well, I know you killed Joaquin. So? That little bastard stole from me. I consider that unacceptable. One point eight-five. - That was fast. - We count millions on millions. - I know the count. - So you're short. Maybe. We took what was there. I also took a million dollars worth of product off the street. That's gotta have some value to you. Follow me. - Baby. Baby! - Conner. Conner. - Did they hurt you? - They're not gonna let us go. Thank you, thank you kindly. For what? Oh shit, somebody here doesn't know. Doesn't know what? How do you think I knew who you were when I saw you? How do you think I knew where you had breakfast in the morning? How do you think I knew you were the perfect person to knock off my competitor without it getting back to me? I don't know what he's talking about, okay? I got one, two, three bullets that say you know exactly what the fuck I'm talking about. Remember, we had to disappear. No job, no family. - Jesus, Tim. - Look at this shit. Look at my veins. Him. He supplied it. I couldn't pay him. Now I owe. You owe him? I'm your fucking brother. Oh shit, the Brady Bunch up in this bitch. Because of you, I can't fucking sleep at night. I see his fucking face. It haunts me every... - You know it wasn't my call! - Every night! It wasn't my call! I was taking orders. Hold on, what? What fucking orders? Brownsville Road standoff. - We were taking orders. - Hold up. You were the ghosts that killed my people that day? I thought you was washed up in Afghanistan. That's the official story. Unofficially... we did the dirty work for Uncle Sam. That was my high school fucking teacher. My basketball coach. Only people I cared about the fucking world. I was the one that triggered that blast. It was me. Well maybe it's you who should take this bullet in the head. No. No. Right fucking here. Put it right fucking here. Just let them go. Aw. Got some Cain and Abel shit up in here. Don't be too sorry. Baby brother didn't really have a choice. Some deaths are played by , and some by skill. Let them go. I got my money. I never want to see them again. Bro, you going soft? Use your head. They just knocked off our competitors on the Southside. They're dead on the streets. We don't need to do this shit. Bro, I'm not getting bit by these... Look out! Come on, baby! Let's go, let's get outta here! Come on. Baby. Tim! Oh, my gosh. Conner, you good? - Fuck you, Tim, he's bleeding. - Get off. - Gotta move. - Get the fuck off of him! Listen! Pettis just wants his money. Your debt, my debt, paid. This was not supposed to happen. Please, I'm fighting here, for you, with you. Okay? We can do this. Come on, get up, we can do this. We got this. Come here, baby. Go, go, go. Everybody aim, when I say shoot, keep your finger on the trigger. don't let go until everyone is dead. One. - Two. - Go. Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear! Oh shit, y'all know you're happy to see me. - I told you we got this. - Yeah, I can see that. Pettis is still alive, he's in the back. All right. - You ready? - Yeah. One, two, go. Move. I'm unarmed! - I'm coming out! - Hands, hands, hands! Let me see your fucking hands! This is the piece of shit that's causing all the trouble? - Yeah. - Piece of shit? I deal not in my worth, in yours. Yeah, but you kill your own. You killed Joaquin. Don't you fucking preach to me. This country is built on fucking crime, fucking settlers. Slavery, thieves. Forbes family got rich off of trading opium. You know what they make with opium? Heroin. And then they put politicians in there to make it illegal to protect their wealth. Every day in this country, they seize drug money. You think they burn that shit? Hell fucking no. You a fucking drug dealer or a history teacher, - you hypocrite mother fucker? - Why am I hypocrite? Because I make money same way white folks do? - And help my community? Huh? - Yeah. I'll fucking shoot you in the face man. Go ahead. Kill me. I'll put a bullet right through you. Yeah. And Alston will come down on you like hell. Say what? I said Alston will come down on you like hell. You working with Alston? The fuck do you know? I made that motherfucker. Yeah, he's crooked but at least he gave a shit about that school and them kids that you fucking killed. Alston killed those kids he made the order, - we carried it out. - Bullshit. Bullshit? You think a ghost team is running around, not taking orders from the brass? You think they don't know what the fuck is happening? Are you stupid? Good story, soldier boy. Prove it. "Prove it." I ain't gonna prove a motherfucking thing to you. I got the gun, I'm gonna take him down and probably you too. You ain't got shit on me. I don't leave loose ends. Let me tell you something about Alston. He's been fucking stealing from us. He's been stealing from you. Most of all, he's been stealing from those kids for a long time. I'm a lot of things. I ain't a liar. How the fuck do you think he got reelected? With my fucking money is how he got elected. Maybe it's time we steal from him. We? There ain't no we. I'm not with you, you're not with me... Captain. I don't trust this fucking guy. Connolly, what choice do you fucking have? You sound crazy as shit. That ain't happening. Tell us the location. And we'll go get it. What the fuck do I look like to you, huh? My knowledge, my rules. How do you know all this? Been clocking Alston for years. Always had a Plan B. He won't move his money again for another six months. He'll have his crew there before the bank opens at 6:30. That gives us a two-hour window starting 30 minutes ago. I need you to arrange transport before the bank opens. No, no, nothing to worry about, just a precaution. He moves his money like a snake, in plain sight, hidden in the weeds. Right now he has legit guards and an armored hearse. Security is always the same. The driver and the hopper. The driver never leaves. His partner is the hopper. Every inch is bulletproof. With all that protection, there are blind spots. Police guarded armored car belongs to a corrupt police chief. Guys. No, it's true. Time is not on our side. Follow me. We got speed. We got the element of surprise and we got violence. Now it's time to bring all three of these mother fuckers. Why didn't you come out blastin'? Against you Rambo motherfuckers on steroids? Hell motherfucking no. My cousin sells birth certificates, real estate sales and everything. You can be who you want to be. Whether this goes good or bad, we're on our own. I just want to pull a curtain back on this motherfucker. - Without a doubt. - Yeah, why not? Y'all ain't wearing that dusty ass gear around me. I do everything in style. Why are you the first face I'm seeing right now? I've been looking at the chief. You gotta be fucking kidding me. - Stuff doesn't add up. - What doesn't add up is you worrying about our boss when we have this fucking case going on. Get your head in the game. - Please, man, listen to me. - Enough, Reynolds. Do you hear me? Enough. You fuck us, I'm gonna put a bullet in your face. Just don't get any blood on the suit. - Surveillance without us? - Why did you get in my car? Why is the hearse sitting at the bank? And why do you care, Alston? 'Cause I'm the fucking boss, man. Why are you sitting in front of this bank, the only bank that's not open yet, and moving money at the same time? - I don't like your tone. - I don't like your stealth act. And I don't like key witnesses dying under your custody. And I don't like feeling like my boss is more concerned about himself than justice. Motherfucker. We're compromised. Damn, we went in too hot. Move! Move! - Cover me! - I got cover. I got cover. Go get the bags. Get the money. We got company. We have you surrounded! You and I are gonna finish this later. I repeat, put your weapons down! Let's put an end to this shit. Get over here. Give it up now, and I'll make sure that you get the chair quick. Dwayne! Dwayne has been shot. Shit! Tim, get him! Tim, I need you, let's go. He's gone! He's gone! Stay focused! Let's go. Come on! I need cover! Get cover! We didn't come here to kill cops. Fuck them! They shot D. We have you surrounded, put your weapons down. I repeat, put your weapons down. Fuck that! We're outnumbered! Go in the motherfucking bank. Go, go, go! Go get the bags! - I'll cover you. - Go! Pettis, grab the bags! go, go! Into the bank! Pettis! Go, go! Freeze! Get out now, get out. Go! Everybody in the room! Everybody in the room! What, do you think I'm just talking to Black people? Get your ass in here. Everybody in that room. Everybody in that room now! Gimme the keys! Gimme the keys! Elevator's clear power's down. What next? We got SWAT in the back. Shit. Power's down. Come out with your hands up. They brought the whole department. Trust me, they don't want none of us to talk. Cap. I had my three seconds. Your time now. When you're going through hell, - you keep going. - Churchill. All right, Timbo, you come with me, we're gonna get the back. Pettis, you go with the captain. You guys got the front. Let's do this. Go, go, go. Come on, I'll cover you. Oh, fuck! Moving in. Come out, motherfucker. Shit! Fuck. I'm out! I'm out too. Getting low. Last mag! Last mag. Let's get the fuck out of here. I'm gonna try and get an angle. Stay put. - Shit. - Fuck. He's hit! What can I do? Huh? I'm gonna get you some help, okay? Conner. Save... save my niece. - No, no, stay with me. - Save my niece. Stay with me. Stay with me. He's dead! Fuck. I love you, Timbo. No, Tim... Get outta there! Hot damn, I've always wanted to Dukes of Hazzard some shit like that. Figured you boys might need these. Let's go all right, come on, let's go. Where's... where's Tim? Dwayne? All right, fuck it. Let's go, let's go, follow me out. Let's go, now! Go! All right, fine, let's get the fuck out of here. Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! - See you in another life. - Stay safe. - Love you. - I love you too. How the fuck do we get out of here? Push the car. I have the bank manager's keys. - Let's take his car. - Which car? What fucking car? I don't know which car. It's the Prius. Come on, let's go. Come on. I'll take it from here. Hey, Schipp. What? Son of a bitch. I need all available units at the Crawford Airport, shoot to kill. There it is. Uh-oh. Here comes the cavalry. Shit. No, we can do this. We can do it. Stop. - We can make it. - Stop, stop. - We can make it. - Stop! Stop? I'm not gonna stop! What the...? How's Jeremy? He's, uh, he's 20. He's not coming out of this. Make the right decision. What are you doing? What are you doing? We can't stop. - We gotta go. - They make it to that plane, - we're all dead. - Whatever y'all do, - do it fast. - What are you doing? Let it go, Conner. I gotta go. That's not how we roll, Captain, you know that. it's my fucking three seconds, my call. That's a direct order. Get out of the car. Password for the pilot is Jeremy. He's paid. Let's go, come on, look! Come on! Candace! Candace! - Where's everybody else? - We gotta go, babe. Mason sent us, password Jeremy. Where we going? Fire! You shouldn't have fucked with me. This has been one of the deadliest days that the city has seen. Several police officers have been killed, the infamous and untouchable Tyrone Pettis and his security are no more. Former Captain Brice Mason is one of the outlaws responsible and he has been killed. Thank you Sylvia. What a shocking story. We'll update you when we get more information. Aw, he loves her daddy, Millie. Come here you want your daddy? Hey, Schipp. Sorry, Alston. Hi, I'm with the Grandview trust fund. We're all set up to send funds to the victims of the Brownsville Road standoff. No, no ma'am, I don't need you to send me any money. No, no, Western Union. I can't say who set it up, they wish to remain... confidential.
