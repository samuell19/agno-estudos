GLEN AND RANDA (23.976 fps) -Come here. -I'M BUSY!! But I found something. I'm doing something! You have to see it. It's a car. It's a tree. Come on up. Come on, we can do it up here. Come on up! Oh look, you cut your foot. Never mind my foot. Look at this. Ow. A bunch of cars. That's what this is. What do you see outside? Trees. And what did you see in the picture? Cars. And..... What are we in? A car in a tree. No! A car becoming a tree. (Mumbles) Listen... You ever been looking down on a leaf and all of a sudden a butterfly came flying out of it? Well, maybe it's the same way with cars. Maybe cars become trees the same way leaves become butterflies. Maybe once this place was... one of the largest used car lots in Blackfoot County. Are your eyes closed? No. Well, mine are. I'm going far away. My eyes are closed but I'm still here. Don't you wonder about things? There were people who lived here a long time ago. They must have been very different from us. They must have been an amazing people. You think they made this, or... maybe it was just a flower that got hard? The things with writing on them were made by men. The things without writing just are. Made in USA. Maybe that's where they all went. Why won't you go away with me? There's no place to go! There's the city. There is not. There's so many interesting things everywhere we go and nobody ever asks any questions. We never stay anywhere long enough to find anything out. And I'll be sitting at a river like this and I'll think... How many people have seen this river before? Probably a lot. And I don't know anything about those people. Maybe someone was sitting in this same place a long time ago asking himself the same questions. You know what I mean? RANDA!! Randa!! What is this? Randa! Up! (cart squeeks) Good. is this good? Who's got the sled? No good. No good. No good. No good. I told you the ones with the shell on them are no good. It's motor oil. This one's good. I thought they were clams. This one's good. This one's good. Ohhh.. A bear went over the mountain, a bear went over the mountain, a bear went over the mountain, to see what he could find. The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain. The bear went over the mountain, to see what he could find. How are ya? You know, I saw your smoke and I couldn't help thinking there's a bunch of people probably dying for some kicks. Well, that's what I'm here for friends. Fun and games! Now, I'm not here to steal your food or feel your women. I'm not here to grab your stuff or treat you rough. I'm here to play. Ladies and gentlemen, I have a show. A proper stage entertainment, to tickle up your liver, laugh your belly into jelly and turn you every way but loose. And that's the truth. Look out!

I'm going to set up my humble camp right over there. But come nightfall, as soon as it gets dark... then there's going to be joy and roof-raising among us! Because tonight's the night of the big show! And, uh, listen... While you're just sitting around the house goosing each other you, uh, might want to look through your knapsacks and, uh... your pockets and see what you can find... in the way of gold money, jewelry and the like. You all just bring it right to me and we'll do business together. Yes, sir. Spit and swap horses, get that old economy moving again. Oh, look. Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about. Well, what I want you to do is to bring me anything that shines or glistens. Because I'll tell you, that real gold, real silver, real jewelry sure makes me smile. Then we could smile together, couldn't we? Yes, we could. Alright, that's it. Tonight after dark... the big show! Gas. Gas? For the engine. For the engine? Gas for the engine. To make the car go. Make the wheels turn around. Get from place to place. Hey, you look pretty strong. I bet you could do this. You want to give it a try? That's good. You just grab right there. That's it. Just keep pulling it out and letting it back in again. That's good. Cars can go. Yeah, cars can go. And fish can swim. Birds can fly. Areas can expand and, uh, projects can originate. Now, look kid. If you're gonna go, you gotta have fuel. You know, brother goes to school, sister goes to dance class. Daddy goes to work. And, uh.... Mommy goes out of her mind. Yeah, but you wouldn't want to eat the gasoline. Look, uh... Don't ever let me catch you doing this. Smoking around a gas pump. Whoa, god. You know anything about these? You know how to play 'em? Huh?.....I just got it. -No. -I'd sure like someone to show me how. It's a Hohner Marine Band. Well, look....As soon as you finish up there....... Fill up the other can. Put it all together, and bring it all over to my rig there. I got something to show you. Alright? Keep pumpin'. I see now? Let there be light! I now see... the tower of the big top. I don't care if you're fat or thin. I don't care if you're tall or short. I don't care if you're hip or square, if you're nearsighted or farsighted, if you're straight, gay, or Republican! Come on in. Statistics tell us... I'm telling you statistics tell us that everybody has got something they need. Everybody is somebody's fool! Owww! Can you dig it? Ladies and gentlemen... I want to tell you that it is no longer necessary to live without the necessities of life. Everything is there. The cornucopia is wide open. You've got to remember that the business of business, is business. All you have to do is reach out your hand. Just get on the pipe... Hello, Sol. Buy Xerox! Now, I'm telling you it's all there waiting for you. Everything is important, anything is possible. Get the leads. You just have to touch things and they go. The world is made for us! For you and me. So, what's the point of eating raw bread? Now, I'm going to show you...put it right in there... I'm going to show you the miracle of modern science in operation! Just watch it go. Watch it go. Anything is possible. The fruits of the earth with Man's ingenuity become all things, for all men. Now, the miracle. Cereal! I'm telling you, folks. Anything is possible. So long as you keep your eye on the future. Don't try to look back to the past. I think it's time I got to know you people and you got to know me. So, I'm going to take a little trip into the audience here. Here's a little lady right here. What's your name, honey? Well, what's my name? That's all right, honey. We got a prize for you anyway. This official plastic pig. All you have to do.. is wind it up and it'll go anywhere. Take you anywhere, too. There's a fine looking little creature there. How are you, honey? Say, tell us, uh.... Tell us what that feels like. Come on, what does it feel like to you? Come on. Aw, come on. Can't win 'em all. Well... I can feel it starting to happen. I can feel it coming up now. There's a climax coming. Can you feel it? Can you taste it? Can you smell it? Can you see it? It's coming. The circle grows tighter. Yes, sir. It is the biggest event in theatrical history. The biggest thing since Jackie fired the maid. Show business heaven! Get the bubbles. I recollect that it was in El Paso that Broadway Joe pulled the plug and fired the cannon. O-kay. Can you read me? The first step is coming. One giant step for mankind. You can feel it. I can feel it. We all know... it's going to happen. The big step is here. Okay. Hold on. Dig in. Blast off! And it's a high line drive to center field. The end of an era, it's history in the making. Now we have done it. Now we are at the top. Cue the healing. Now the thunder subsides. Every cloud's a veritable thrill and delight. Now we are on the move. Can you read me? All systems are go. If music be the food of love, then play on! Hurry up, it's coming to an end. Just take a match and light it. Use the other side, you jerk. That's it. Just drop it there. Drop it, damn it. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh. Ahh! Get the sand can you idiot! Ow! That really hurt me this time. Goddamn it! Ow! Oww! That's enough, stop it. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Stop it! Thank you, thank you. I'm honored. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. It's loveliness increases, it will never pass into nothingness but will keep a bower quiet for us. And a sleep full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing. That guy died when he was 25. I guess that's, uh, the name of the game. Is there a city? Is there...a city? Why, yes. There's a city, my boy. There's the towers of Babylon... the seven cities of Cibola. There's canyons of steel. Where is the city? It's far, far away. Over the mountains. You don't want to go there. Yes, I do. i do want to go there. The bear went over the mountain, The bear went over the mountain, The bear went over the mountain, To see what he could find. What is this city really like? The other side of the mountain, He saw another mountain. He saw another mountain, That's all that he could find. Why don't you come inside? To my pleasure palace. Come on, you haven't seen it yet. Warmer. Nice in here. This is Xanadu. Here, let me take that stuff from you honey. Just put it over here. That's it. Okay, you sit right there son. You sit over here. Here honey, you sit over here. Look at that. Satin sheets. Bet you never saw that before. You sit down there and wiggle around and see what it feels like. You tell me what it feels like there. Well, let's see. We got fried clams. We got, uh.. peanut butter. And we got ketchup. Well, the Indonesians cook with, uh.. peanut butter. I guess we'll have an Indonesian dish, huh? Nasi goreng. Alright, nasi goreng. What's the matter? What's the matter? Tell me about the city. Tell you about the city, huh? I want to go there. Well, I'll tell you. It's a sinful and decadent place. I was born and raised there. I was 15 when the whole thing was totaled. Now, I guess you could drop me on my street in the middle of the night bare assed and I'd know right where I was. Oh... They was dropping dead in the streets for years. Waters rising and... Oh, there's Merv Griffin, Dean Martin on the tube. They said it all. Down in New York City, I got nothing to do. Sorry that I can't take you. Combinations. Rock and roll. And, uh, the Pelham Parkway. Holland Tunnel. Rain on the Taft Hotel. Mick Jagger. I'll tell you this kid. It all comes to show business in the end. And that's the truth. Here you are, honey. This is for you. I'll dig out some more stuff later. Here you are. This is for you. And this is for me. It's a tasty morsel. Something to, ah, wrap your tongue around. Yeah. Food for the soul. Ladies and gentlemen, there exists before me in ripe plumpness and innocence ...an old man's satisfaction. What do you say, kid? Just lay it on me? Thank you, sweet one. What? Are there people there? Where? In the city. People in the city... Oh... I don't think so. There might be people there but you don't want to go there, kid. Yes, I do. Oh, take a raincheck on it. Let's look at some snaps. If you're asking me what it's like.... Look at this. This'd be my father. And the biggest fallout shelter in the Bronx. He was on the road when it came down. Why don't I, uh, sit down here. He was on the road when it came down. This is the summer house we had in Pekahoe. See? That's my sister. She's a knockout, huh? Pretty? Looks a little bit like you. This is me and little Eddie. Cute, huh? Would you tell me how to get to the city? You're some kind of fanatic, aren't ya? Tell you what. Why don't you... go out on the back of the motorcycle. And on the locker, you know, those big tall lockers. On the left...You open it up and there's a whole pile of stuff in there. And you see right on top of it, there's a map. You know what a map is. No. Well, it's a big piece of paper all folded up like an accordian. If you open it up you see all these red lines and different colored names of places. Right on the front, when it's folded up, it says Idaho. Okay? You just get that. Okay? You're a friendly little thing, aren't you? Yeah, nice friendly little thing. I'll tell you what. Let's just... commemorate this for posterity. I hope you're not offended. Now look, uh.... I'm kind of an old man here. I don't know... I don't want to do anything wrong. Anything to offend you, you understand. So, uh... If I do anything to offend you... You just let me know. Okay? Okay? Because, uh... My pleasure.... is your pleasure, understand? I'm still, uh....pretty well muscled. Oh, I know it's kind of funny, I suppose. Here... yeah... You like that, don't you? You're really like an angel. You're just as smooth as heaven. Oh, yeah. Take me to the city! Lift your leg. Ah, yes. Where's the noise? Ahhhh.... Oh, god. Help me, now. You want to lift up there. You want to lift yourself up. Ah, yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah, that's good. Ahhh... You make me feel like a teenager. That feel good? Is that good? Huh? Open it, open it up. Sorry, wait a minute. Don't twist my arm. Now just a minute, goddamn it. I'll get right to it. There by god. Look at that. Isn't that something? By God, there's a little life in the old soldier yet. Look. You don't know how beautiful that is. Okay. Now, you see where this red line is here... That's the freeway. Now, you see how that freeway keeps going down and keeps going south. Right? Well, down right there and right across the mountains ...that's the city. Right across the mountains. You are too good a man for slavery, Prince Valiant. I give you a quest. Well, you go and find the Holy Grail. Go ahead. Find the Holy Grail.......Go ahead. You don't have to go if you don't want to, honey. Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm going. You're going to the city? You coming with me? You don't have anything to eat. I got the cans from the magician. - We don't have any fire. - I got Diamond matches from the magician. - Yeah, but you don't know how to get there. - I got the map. Wake up, you fanatic. The fire's going out. Huh, what? Hey, I got some plates! Why don't we go someplace better? I'm reading this book I found in the Samsonite. It's a Wonder Woman book. Her face changes in every square. Maybe that's how come she can fly. I wonder if I'll be able to change like that. You never change. Don't hurt us, we just want to go to the city. He can't talk. He only wants to eat us like the rest of the dogs. It's not a dog. Oh, I know... The magician had a box of them with a picture on the front. Little things inside. It's a camel. It won't hurt us. Ti-i-i-me is on my side. Yes it is. Ti-i-me is on my side. Ti-i-i-me is on my side. He's following us. I think he wants to come. He looks so tired. Get a rope. -There's no rope around here. -There's everything everywhere. Glen, do you think I'm changing? I feel terrible. I think this is a horse, not a camel. I'll tell you a story to make you happy. There's a boy who's crippled who comes into the book to help Wonder Woman. And he says a very loud "Shazam!" and there's lightning... and he becomes Captain Marvel. And he saves Wonder Woman and everybody's happy except for the people that are still purple and blue. Glen, I want to go back to the road. I want to stop. I'm stopping! Maybe you're going to have some babies. Well, we can put 'em in a sack and take them to the city with us. We've got nothing to make a sack out of. Well, why don't you have it now while they're small and I can carry them in my pocket. I can't do that. I don't know how to do that. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! The horse won't come! Come on, you can make him come. Come on! I'm not coming either! Come on!! Glen! Glen!! Let me try. Let me try. Gimme. Wait! Aw, you.... Glen! -Give me the box. -What..wait. Glen... Hey, I only got a couple left. You always say there's everything everywhere. Glen? Do we have enough matches to get to the city? Glen? What are we going to eat when the cans run out? What are we going to eat when the cans run out? Glen? Glen? I want to stay here. It's beautiful here. Everything's so green. There's plenty of water here. We can find good things to eat in the woods. Shazam! Shazam! Shazam! Batman and Aquaman and Trackman and Flagman and...Broadway Joe and the Bronx and.... Playboy and canyons of steel and glittering lights...and Doris Day and Polaroid...and Palisades Park and Safeway and Rock and Roll and Prince Valiant and....the Holland Tunnel and Playboy and Miss January and Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones and ice machines and Broadway....and.... Can we have a fire? There's no wood. We could burn the Wonder Woman. It's our last match. Can we go back? We wouldn't make it. You better eat some. Swallow it. Swallow it! You know.... I haven't seen anyone in 20 years. Milk. I'm going to take you to a house. A house? Yeah. You can stay there and have the baby. You are going to have a baby, aren't you? It's only twenty minutes from here. Twenty minutes? Well.... Maybe a half hour. I don't understand. You don't? I guess I'm kind of out of practice talking. I mean, it's like I said, I haven't talked to anyone in a long time. No, I mean what's twenty minutes? What's twenty.... Well I don't.... -Do you want to? -What? Do you want to? Want to what? You know... Like I said, go to the house. Okay. How do you feel? Should we? Oh, you mean now. Where'd he go? I don't know. You said we were going to a house? Yes. What's your name? Sidney Miller. I'm Glen and she's Randa. Is this the end of the world? Couldn't see very far from here because of the mountains. Beautiful mountains. And the freeway started right over there. It went right up... ...right up through the mountains. Beautiful driving in the mountains. Then, uh... My Aunt had a farm over there. Wasn't very big, but..... you'd grow a lot of.... Look at those birds. Seagulls. Seagulls. I don't eat birds. I don't like fishing either, but I guess I better fish rather than go out in the mountains. Well.... uh... I'll tell you ..now.. Howie Hawkes owned all that land in there. I'll tell you something about Howie Hawkes. He grew the best potatoes in Idaho. I don't like to say that, but he did. Sidney Miller, you live here? No, this is Arleen's house. You and your wife can sleep here on the sofa. No, wait! Wait! Did you people just come up from the city? No, we're looking for the city. But it's... back down...a few miles down the road. About 10 miles. But I heard it all burned down. You must have passed it. Is this house going to burn down too? Oh, no. This is a new trailer. No, that's not our city. What's the name of your city? Well, it's been a long....... Boise. That's it. That's the name of the city. That's not the name of our city. Our city's Metropolis. Has lots of cars and all the clothes are white. And...all the people can fly. Metropolis must be a nice city. I never went there. Have you ever seen a baby before? Oh, sure. Goats have babies all the time. Why don't you get out if you're not going to help me. Acting like you're sick all the time. What's the matter, little mother? -Sidney Miller? -Yes? What's this? -That's a TV. -What is it for? Oh, they used to watch it all the time. He walks around there and looks at things and touches things. That's all he ever does. Oh, don't worry about it. He'll die sooner or later. Nothing lasts. You..wouldn't..complain..so..much... about..not.. having..the.. clothes.. and things...like..that. Actually..they..live..like..animals. But..you..start..to feel..sorry..for them.. and...start..to..make..a....a... people... out..of..them. It's nothing to see them walking down the road... and if...they..have..to..go..to..the..bath..room.. They..just..stop and go..right..where ..they..are,...men..and...women...alike. It's..enough..to..make..you..sick..to..your..stomach. We're not animals, we're people! We have to start living like people and be civilized! Civilized... Sit down and watch. Oh, yes, dearest. Anything that hurts you will hurt me too. Do you love me, Randa? Hello, Sol? Buy Xerox. I can hear him. He's trying to tell me something. What's he saying? He's saying I want to come out. I want to come out and see my father and the world and see what it's like. No, he doesn't. He likes it in there. It's a soft world in there. Hello! Hello!! Hey! Yoo-hoo in there. Come on out and say hello. Say hello. Hello? Hello! Hello? Let's try a new one. But the really good ones are hard to do with your belly like that. It's not my fault! Leave me alone. Why are you mad at me? -Why don't you put the book down and just do it? -What's wrong with the book? -I don't want to do that anymore. -Sometimes you make me sick. You know, one of these days I'm gonna.... ....rip open that big fat stomach. There's four logs here that wasn't here yesterday. These two, that brown one, and that short one. I come down every day and check everthing out. They send these things to me.... ...leave them on the beach.... When the tide goes down I have to check them all. I don't like to get behind. I try to keep up with everything. See what's here. Oh, look at the rocks. I always stop here too. It's a good place to pause. Lots of...green. You like green? I'd, uh.... like to know if I'm supposed to do anything but I guess if I was supposed to know, I'd just know. Wait. Right here's where I usually stop and...listen. Hear that? You said there were mountains over there. Well, used to be. But there's not anymore. Is there a city on the other side? No, no city. Oh! Maybe there is. I hadn't thought of that. Maybe that's where they're sending the things from. I'd wanted to ask you... Are there any more....Are there any more coming? -What do you mean? -You know... More people like you and Randa. Oh, well I'm sorry....I don't.... Just....just forget it. That's all right. This is the sort of thing they send me. Now I don't know if that's alive or dead. But the flies know. I guess the flies know alright. Oh, no, no. Put it down. Oh, I guess that's alright. It doesn't.... It doesn't really matter. Along....about here is where I make my turn. Take a few minutes here. You got the whole expanse. Usually a few birds come over. But it doesn't really matter if there's no birds. You've got the sunset. It's quiet. From here you can see the trailer. The goats. And it's a fine feeling. Fine feeling. Do I look like Arleen? I am Wonder Woman. It's alright to let them burn. We need heat. We should have stayed in the cave by the river. Oh, it hurts! No, it doesn't. Oh, stop! It hurts! She's going to have the baby. Randa? We should go someplace. No. No, I can't. I never been anywhere. What's the baby's name? You can call him anything you want to. I can? We should go someplace. We got to fix the boat. It's leaking. Maybe we could find the city. City burned down. Metropolis didn't burn down. It's at the end of the ocean. I suppose it is. When we get to Metropolis, we could find the name for the baby. Timing: Eazin Typesetting: XraySpecs
