You have completed decompression phase 4. You may now remove your helmets, disposable backpacks, airbags and cowlings. Controlled environment has now been stabilised. So what did we find out there? I don't really care, man, as long as we get a damn good bonus for this thing. I'm sure we will when they find out what was in that rock. Damn I'm thirsty! - So what do you think, Doc? - I don't know, you guys... Looks like another rock to me. Well Doc, the way I see it, this probe is worth a lot of money. According to the rock scanner, this thing is full of electronic circuitry. Ain't that something? Let me tell you something else, Doctor... We're the first guys to play football on Mars... ...ever. Every time you guys bring something back to me, you think it's something special. Your scanner's probably busted. Excuse me, gentlemen. The Captain's a little disturbed about you taking so long. Alright, we'll check this out later. Doc, make sure the Major knows we found this thing. Warning! Oxygen at critical level.

We already chucked that out. It's good to have you back, Colonel. How are things back on Earth? Better than they are here, I understand. Yes, we have had our problems. Have you found out what happened on the C37 yet? Not yet sir, but we have our best computer expert working on it right now. So a Priest comes running down the stairs... ...and big crowds gather around the dead guy. One of the crowd says... does anybody here know this guy?. And the Priest goes no, but his face rings a bell. Yeah, that's pretty funny. Hey, did you see the beautiful blonde with the Colonel over there? Yeah I saw her, so what? Hey, listen man... Come on, she looks nice. Hand me that battery, will ya? Would you hurry up with that thing? The court's reserved for 14:00. Hang on, buddy, I'm almost done. I'm hooking up the APU. - What's the APU? - The auxilliary power unit. We civillians, unlike you military personel, do it right the first time! Man, if I didn't know you better I'd be a little worried about you. You spend too much time with those computers. You heard about what happened on this ship, didn't you? Yeah, I heard. They found it floating in space with a permanently checkout out crew. Suffocation, crazy bastards. Probably forgot to turn on the auto stabilisers before they went to sleep. You know, you never hear about that stuff back on Earth. Just never hear about it. And for sure you never hear about it in the tele-papers. Is my battery rod over there? Oh, never mind, here it is. How could those guys have been so stupid? That's what happens to you, man, when you've been out here too long! Your mind starts to go. They hushed it up real fast. I'm surprised you heard about it. Are you kidding me, man? When you've been in security as long as I have, you hear about everything! - I could tell you some stories... - I found the problem. Problem? You're the problem! We're losing valuable court time! Gentlemen, shall we begin? Colonel... Our company... cannot take the responsibility for the incompetence of Major Porter's men. My men had nothing to do with cracks being found in 4 out of the 5 outtake valves. And twice last week, two second stage alerts? You know damn well, Porter, that we corrected any problem... before any real danger occured. Any real danger?! Colonel, you should check the files on January 4th. ...no, Marlice. Damn you! This is a delicate operation! Do you want to screw up four hours work? It's getting a little too intense in here for me. I'll wait for you on the court. There, I got it! What the hell did you do? I didn't do anything. What level's four on? Second. What's going on out there? A wall's caved in and hundreds of people are trapped out there. What's going on? Code Seven Alert! Code Seven Alert! This is not a drill. Please report to your assigned emergency escape capsule. Sir! It's a fire in reactor four. Hey! Is there anybody up there? This is Roger Campbell, who's there? Lieutenant Lynn, I'm in the engine room. What's going on here? Do you know? No, but Campbell, you'd better get us the hell of here! Code Seven means we only have seconds until we're reduced to carbon molecules. Get ready to give me full power, Billi. We're all going to die! We're all going to die! Take care of this lady for me, will you? Do you think you can fly this thing, bud? I'm going to give it a hell of a try! Billi, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay! Billi, come on up here. Billi, did you hear me? Yeah, I heard ya! I'll be up in a minute. Like it or not, we're all in this together. Now, if we're going to make it, we'll all have to work as a team. But where are we going to go? There's not enough food to last over a few months. I'm sure they'll send up a search party, but even a starship will take over a year to get here. The way I see it, there's only one thing we can do. According to the computer, there are two emergency supply depots between here and earth. They should give us enough supplies to make a two year trip. Provided they're not too far apart. But why will it take so long to get home? Because this is a shuttle craft, not a long-range space craft. The way I see it is that each one of us is going to have to handle certain duties. Now, obviously Lieutenant Lynn can operate and maintain the shuttle's power plant Dr. Kimberly, you'll be in charge of the food and water supplies throughout the trip. Sherrie, I believe you worked in the kitchen aboard the L5 base? Yeah. Well, if you don't mind, you'll be in charge of preparing the meals. Now, we can all pitch in for clean-up. Roger, you'll be in charge of operating the shuttle. And I'll help Roger to fill in wherever needed. Well, as I understand it, Roger Campbell is not a pilot. You're an engineer, aren't you Mr. Campbell? Computer's are my specialty. Since you're not a pilot, how do you intend to fly this ship back to earth? In case you didn't notice, you don't fly these things with a steering wheel. They're run by computers. And if you can find someone more qualified, I'd be more than happy to step down. Will we really be able to make it back to earth on a ship this small? I can answer that. As I said before, this is a shuttle craft. It's not designed for long-range travel or re-entry. However, if I modify the propulsion system, we should be able to get enough power to slow her down for re-entry. If not, we'll all be dead before we know it anyway. So, barring any unforeseen meteor storms, I'd say we've got a 60/40 chance. And that's a whole lot better than they had on L5. Well, we have a lot of work ahead of us, so let's get going. Oh yeah, there's one more thing... One of us has got to make the final decisions for all of us. I suggest Roger since he's flying the ship. Shall we take a vote? All those in favour, raise your hands 3 out of 5. Majority rules, so it's settled. You got it. Oh, Sherrie... You're not the one who made those chicken pot pies, are you? No, that was Bob. I can't tell you how much better that makes me feel. Boy, you're really too much! I can't help it, man! It's in my blood. Looks like you're gonna have to settle for Billi! Adrian hates your guts and Sherrie's in love with me. I figured out the computer command code. I asked it to plot our course. Let's see how it's done. Completed computations on course to follow. How long will it take? With a maximum stop-over at each supply depot of 24 hours and a maximum flight speed of 52,000 mph it will take 18 months and 3 days and 14 hours. Where do we fuel up for the trip? The nearest supply depot is Alpha 7, 120 hours from this point. What kind of food's on Alpha 7? - She won't answer you. - Why not? She's only programmed for my voice. - Racist! - No, she just has good taste. What kind of food's on Alpha 7, Bernice? - Bernice? - Steinberg programmed her. Alpha 7 has K20 survival food. K20? Man, that stuff's the worst! I'd rather eat my shoe! K20 is a perfect balance of proteins, carbohyrates, amino-acids and vitamins. Still tastes like dog shit! Bernice, proceed to Alpha 7. - I cannot do that. - Why not? The main propulsion system is still down. Lieutenant Lynn, this is Roger. I'm going to need full power. Campbell, if you don't leave me alone, I'm never going to be able to finish this damn thing! Whoever maintained this shuttle craft didn't know their arse from their elbow! I ain't gonna give you the time of day until this ship is running right! I think she likes you. How long till she's ready, Billi? I can't get the main fusion reactor activated. And stop that Billi crap! It's Lieutenant Lynn! Now I know she likes you! Let me know when you're ready, Lieutenant. You'll be the first to know, Captain! I don't need this. Is there anything else you want me to do, Captain? - Yeah, do you give charm lessons? - Charm lessons, Captain? Adrian? Yeah? Hello ladies, this is Roger Campbell, your friendly host for this trip. And I... Save it, Campbell. Sherrie's not here, what do you want? I'm not cut out for this, Cal. I can't do it. You're doing okay, buddy. Look Adrian, we're all still in a little shock over what's just happened. I'm just trying to lighten things up a little. Well keep your humour to yourself, Campbell. And it's Dr. Kimberly to you. Yeah. Well Doc, if you don't mind, at your convenience I'd like to have a progress report on the food and water supply. - Look, I've already done that, Campbell. - It's Captain Campbell to you! There's enough food for three weeks. However, part of the water supply has been polluted. By what? That's what I was working on when you interrupted me. Well you let me know as soon as you find out! Yes Captain, sir! I wish that jerk would let me alone. I brought you some food. - Did I say something wrong? - Sorry, it's not you. Hey Campbell, I've fixed your propulsion system for ya! You can put the mains back on line. Oh, and by the way Campbell, leave the auto-controls alone. I'm still working on 'em. Thanks Bill...I mean Lieutenant Lynn. Damnit! What the hell is this? Some kind of stupid joke? Captain Campbell... I thought you guys might be hungry. What, no chicken pot pie? No chicken pot pie! So what does this do? Oh, it's a heat-sensing monitor. Shows where everyone is in the shuttle. See, this is where we are now in the control room. - So how long until we get to Alpha 7? - Oh, about 5 more days. - How long until earth? - 18 months according to Bernice. - Who's Bernice? - The computer, Roger's new sidekick. You know something, Sherrie? You're one foxy lady. Really? I think I'm a little overweight. Not to worry! When you start downing the new K20 rations you'll find that extra weight falls right off. Oh, hi Sherrie! I didn't even notice you come in. I must have really been out of it. Now that's a man with great devotion to his job! Food! Great, I'm starved! Haven't eaten in over 12 hours, thanks a lot! Believe you me, that's unusual for him! Glandular problems, you know. Oh, hey, Sherrie, would you do me a favour? Go back and have Billi call me. I think she's mad at me. She won't answer her intercom. Sure, I was going to go bring her some food anyway, Roger. I mean, Captain. Roger's fine. I'm not cut out for this new stuff anyway. Gee, I thought you were doing pretty good! Really? Ah, I think I'll have another sandwich! Do you really think we're going to be able to make it home? Hey, what is this? Don't show any tears, we're doing just fine! I'm sorry, everything's just... Where there's a will, there's a way. Listen pretty lady, we're not going to let anything happen to you. You hear me? Thanks, guys! Poor gal's really scared, isn't she? Yeah, I've seen it happen many times before. You can't stay up here too long. All that emptiness makes you crazy after a while. That's probably why they scheduled her for leave. Yeah, I'm starting to get real depressed myself. Billi? Billi? Billi? Billi, are you here? Billi? Billi, are you okay? What happened? Here, sit down. It's okay now, just breath deeply. Now tell me what happened. - It's Billi... - What about Billi? She's...she's dead! - She's got slime... - Slime? It's all over her! Hold still, I'm going to take a sample. Campbell? Hello, beautiful! Cut it, Campbell! We don't have much time, so listen and listen carefully. Sherrie's just come back from the engine room and is hysterical. As far as I can tell, something has happened to Lieutenant Linn and it has something to do with a slimey substance all over Sherrie's pants. We've always been a bit suspicious of Billi's lesbian traits. - What did she do? - I think she ripped off the intercom. - How am I going to talk to her? - Use the emergency PA system. Good idea! That'll do it. Come on, now! Talk to me, would you? I didn't mean it. Adrian, just kidding! Adrian, come on, would ya? We were just having a little fun! I didn't mean to do anything. Adrian, come on now, what's the matter? Look, I'm going to input this chemical breakdown into the main computer for a source analysis. You'll be safe here as long as you keep that inner chamber door locked. Doctor Kimberly, I'm serious. I need you to talk to me right now! After I leave, you lock it. Do you hear me? Okay, I'll be right back. I want to talk to you, Doctor Kimberly, and that's an order! Something's wrong. Damn you, Kimberly! Enough is enough, what's going on back there? I think I better go back there. Oh, well look what big heroes we have here! Now can I get access to the main computer without you shooting me? - Why won't this thing answer me? - It's only programmed for my voice. Well that's real smart! What if you got killed? I never thought of that. Just forget it and tell it to give me an answer. It's alright, Bernice. The following elements are from some unknown life-form. Its molecular structure does not require oxygen to live. Well that's just great! Whatever that thing is it's polluted half our water supply! Did you try to get in touch with Lieutenant Lynn? She wouldn't answer. Wait a minute, she's in the supply room. - That's not Billi. - How do you know? Whatever it is, it doesn't display the same temperature code as a human. What the hell is that thing? - Sherrie, did you lock that inner door? - Here, try this! Sherrie, this is Dr. Kimberly. Listen closely: go over to the inner hatch door and manually lock it. Okay? Do it now, Sherrie! Sherrie, there's a glass container of acid on the table next to you. Throw it at that thing right now! No... Hang on, buddy! I'm gonna open the out hatch and suck that thing into space! He'll suffocate! It worked! There's one light on. Quick, close the hatch door before he freezes to death. That's not Cal's dot. No! There's nothing else we could have done. He would have died anyway. The door's unlocked. When I was a little girl, I used to sleep out under the stars. On a hot summer's night. I'd wonder who lived on all the shiny little stars. Did you ever used to wonder about things like that, Campbell? Night, Campbell. What's causing that? I don't know. What happened? Bernice, why is the air supply in here cut off? - You told me to, Captain. - I told you to? - Affirmative. - When? 47 minutes and 25 seconds ago, Captain. We've got to set up a cross formation. Bernice, this is a code 327. Disconnect all terminals except the control room. Why do I get the feeling... ...I did exactly what it wanted me to. It can't turn off our air supply. But we can't turn it off in there either. Well, what are we going to do? We've got to find out more about this thing. I wish we could find the laser cards on that expedition. How does this thing work? - What, the video laser? - Yeah. You push the blue button, why? Maybe they're in here? - The laser cards? - Yeah. No way, they would have checked there first. Then what's that? I'll be damned! How many hours are on that thing? - Twenty five. - Twenty five? Alright... 25 hours? Can't you speed that thing up a little? What? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's much better. SC37, this is SC45. What was that? Who could be in this sector? SC37 this is, uh, space craft 45. Howdy there! SC37, come up on emergency frequency 135-85. Yes SC45, we read you. We have an emergency situation. Repeat: an emergency situation. Unknown life-form has killed three of the crew. Need assistance. Repeat: need assistance. Ah, shuttlecraft 37... ...it looks like your transmitter's out. We had the same problem after... SC45, this is SC37. Do you hear us? Something's jamming our out-going signal. Your course to Alpha 7 looks the same as ours. Looking at the split screen... ...no major damage to the hull that I can see, C37. Should be good news, anyway. Tell you what, why don't we do this... If everything's okay, why don't you give me a 30 degree right turn. That's a a 30 degree right turn, SC37. SC37, this is SC45. If you're okay, I tell you what, give us a thirty degree right turn. Okay, looks good SC37. Alright. Good to have you with us, SC37. Tell you what, we'll keep in track with you every few hours, give you a call. And, uh, have a good trip. Goodnight. Damnit! Damnit! That son of a bitch Are you crazy? It'll just kill you, too! Listen to me! That's not going to help! Stop it, just stop it! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. So when they brought it aboard... it was like a newborn baby that started to grow. And according to the tests they ran on it, not only did it grow in size but also in intelligence. In the two days before the accident, it went from barely being able to move to being able to find its way out of a maze a 9 month old chimp couldn't figure out. So there's just no knowing how intelligent that thing is now or when it's going to reach its adult potential. So whatever that thing is back in the engine room, it came from some kind of probe that crashed on Mars. And, according to the soil samples, was buried for over 300,000 years And according to the notes at the end of that tape, that crystal functions like some kind of extremely advanced computer. Evidently the creature was able to activate it when it was confronted with a difficult problem. And that would explain where it's getting all the knowledge to operate our computer. So the crystal must still be onboard. It may be a computer... but it's also some kind of power supply. Strong enough to move that probe and to fry out all the circuits on this ship. Why would it want to do that? I don't think it did. The notes said they were going to try a laser on that crystal. Even on a palladium crystal that's risky, but on that thing... God knows what could have happened! SC37, this is 45. You have an emergency situation. Repeat: emergency situation. Meteor storm at 12 o'clock! Take immediate evasive action! Get the hell out of there, boys! Meteor storm at 12 o'clock! I don't know if they can make it... Bernice, how close is it? We have entered it. What happened? Bernice, what happened to the meteor storm? We are in the middle of it. Why aren't we being hit? There is a force-field around us. Force-field? There aren't any force-fields on short-distance shuttle crafts, are there? Not that I know of. Bernice, where's the force-field's point of origin? The engine room. Bernice, are we through the meteor storm yet? - We just came out of it. - Give me a damage report. Minor damage to the outer hull. The power supply terminals to the engine room have been burned out. Adrian. Adrian, are you okay? Roger... Please don't go. I have to. Adrian! Open the door! Adrian, can you hear me? Son of a bitch! He never touched me and he turned the air back on. Listen, I brought some food back. Let's see here... There's a French delicacy! Campbell's Tomato! Or how about Tomato? Of course there's always that favourite, Campbell's Tomato Tomato. Now you're probably wondering, if I'm related to the Campbells of Campbell soup... Actually, it was my great, great, great grandfather who founded the company back in the late 1800s. Unfortunately, he lost it all in a gambling game in the badlands of South Dakota. I remember the night well! There was a cold wind blowing in from the North... and I said to him "you've been a good boy, uncle!". Evidently our friend has found some way to fix those circuits. I checked with Bernice and we're back on course to Alpha 7. We should be there in another 24 hours. - What is it? - It accessed the computer. Luke 6..Verse 27 But I say to you who hear: love your enemies do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who spitefully use you. Matthew 7..Verse 12 Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. He tapped into our computer, why can't we tap into his? How can we? Bernice, where d'you go? I was answering requests from terminal 7. How soon until Alpha 7's deceleration? Speed brakes must be activated in 45 minutes. Can the speed brakes be activated from here? Negative. Retro-fire must be initiated in engine room. Be careful. Yeah. After I leave, you lock this door. And you don't open it until you hear my voice. Do you understand? Roger, look out, it's beside you! - Roger, I'm coming down there! - No, stay there! Campbell. What do you want? I need this ship. We need it too. What about the woman and I? What do you plan to do with us? I'll decide. Decide? What is there to decide? Are you going to kill us like you did your last three victims? You would have done the same. Your life-form... ...usually kills anything that is... ...unfamiliar. I killed. I was afraid of dying. From your computer I learned your lack of respect for life. No respect for life? You murdered three people. Knowledge comes from my crystal. Killing was non-existant until I encountered your kind. I killed in self defense. What about the girl, Sherrie? She didn't intend to harm you. I had no intention of harming anyone. She threw acid on me and the other shot me. What are you going to do with us now? Are you going to kill us? No. Well would you let us down now? We won't try to harm you again. Thankyou. You said you needed the ship. Can't the other ship take you home? What if it's already left? Bernice, how long was the shuttle craft 45 delayed due to the meteor storm? Three hours in detour and seven in making repairs. We should arrive before they do. That is true, Gar. Gar? That is my name. Bernice, how many hours to Alpha 7? You may answer, Bernice. At current speed, five hours and twenty-two minutes. In order for us not to fly past Alpha 7, I'll need to reprogram the computer and take control of the engine from the command console The control is yours. Then we're free to go? Yes. You will help us get on the other ship? Yes. How do we know you'll keep your word? You have to believe me. And I'll believe you. I'll be in the control room. Couldn't you program the computer from here? Yes. Well then why did you let him go do it? Humans must feel needed. It's called ego. Is that why you let him go do it? He does seem better now. It's strange but...I feel that I can trust you. You can. Gar, I'm having trouble altering my course. You're going to have to come up here and assist me. Must be nice! Now, this should keep you in food for a while. Are you sure you can eat this stuff? This will be quite sufficient. Will there be enough for you and your crew? Oh yeah, sure, we got plenty. Roger... I'm sorry about your friend . Cal? His death has shown me the importance of life. I haven't had too much time to think about him 'til lately. I didn't understand. We all just didn't understand. We can only afford to wait for one more day. Have patience. Gar... ...are you ever afraid? Yes, but the crystal helps me understand. I haven't placed it yet. You released your hand. I did not! Why is he such a jerk? Play. Captain, a gravity tunnel has opened in sector five, causing an orbital velocity change. SC37 should now prepare to jettison from Alpha 7 within the next 24 minutes in order to intercept the next earth orbital path. You will take this ship. But then how will you get home? I believe I can convert the Alpha 7 into mobility through the use of the crystal. I value your friendship more than you know, but this is the best way. I will always remember you.
