Late night? I'm up now. Where were you? Fuck! At a strip club? My clients wanted to go, so I took them. - That's convenient. - Well, it's true. So you're blowing your money on strippers. It was the client's money. The same money that pays for all your trips down south. Fucking selfish asshole. Here. Do you want to open your presents? - Now? - Yeah. It's her birthday. - No way! - I knew it! Oh my God! I wanted one so bad! I know! I was so excited to give it to you. Happy birthday, sweetie! You finally got it. - I got it! - Yes! - I can't wait to listen to music! - Open the other one. You've been asking for this too. What is it? Christiane F. Are you happy? - "Drug addict and prostitute." - It's what she wanted. Everyone at school has it. It's so cool. You don't get it. I love you, sweetie. Happy birthday! What's this? - $1,000? - $1,000. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. - Happy birthday, honey. - Thanks, Dad! - $1,000? - Yes. She's 16. So? You know what? You're just jealous. Calm down! Stop it! Jesus! Stop! Stop it. Calm down. This is what I'm talking about. Your Native blood makes you act like a fucking lunatic. Calm down! Fuck! Enough! You fucking asshole! Fucking hell! I'm telling you, sometimes... - Go on, leave! - Goddamn right, I'm leaving! You're crazy! Just like your mother! Get off! That's my Jeep! It's modern, huh? The house. It's modern. What's wrong? It's small. It'll just be us. Come on, help me measure the table. Hold this and stand there. You don't like it? It's fine. It won't fit. Try over there. This is hard for me too, you know. It's fucking tiny. I don't get what we're doing here. You want me to stay with your father? Here. Stand over there. Can't you wait till he's back from his fishing trip? Wait for what? I don't know, Mom. You always take his side. That's not true. You can live with him if you want. Take out your favourite one. It looks awesome in the sun. Look. It's sparkly! It's stretchy. It's sexy, but cute. You know? It's skin tight. You put it on... Sold! - You know the red coat? - Yeah. I wanna get that next. It was nice. It was expensive, though. Yeah, but thanks, Dad, for the money! - Your dad is so intense. Seriously. - Yeah. Is he OK? Yeah. He just wanted to piss off my mom. Trash her Jeep. - Look. He's over there. - I know. I don't get what he's doing with her. Mélanie Belley. She thinks she's so cool with her truck and Lois jeans. But I'm sorry, sweetie. When you wear belly shirts and do your makeup like a slut, don't wear Lois jeans. Fucking airhead. You know our brothers box together? In Jonquière. Their whole family is fucked. - Hey, Catherine. - Hey. Cat! You like Pascal, huh? Stop it! Bitch! - Stay away from my boyfriend. - Stop! Cunt! You visited the house of someone I know! I go fishing, and some guy tells me my wife is leaving. I should have left when you cheated! Get over it! That was five years ago. - You can't stop me from leaving. - No, but I'm not giving you a cent. Hello? Yes, speaking. What? Thank you. You didn't go to school today? - What happened to your face? - Ow! Nothing. - Oh my God! You were raped. - Come on. - What happened? - Nothing. Who did this? Who did this? Tell me who did it. I can't believe you let this happen in your school. - Where are all the teachers? - It was outside of class hours. It was at lunch, inside the school. Students have to speak up. We're speaking up now. Are you gonna suspend her? Transfer her? - We talked. - Mélanie apologized. - That won't fix my daughter's face! - A transfer won't either. - It wouldn't happen again. - It won't happen again. I don't know anymore. Is everyone here a fuck-up? Ma'am, please. You don't just pounce on people like that! - Tighter. - I'm trying. Not too tight. Fuck! Did I tell you he has a motocross bike too? - No way! - Yeah! - Did he take you for a ride? It's not a motorcycle. Get with it. I was in the sand pit, and he showed up on his bike. He comes up to me, takes off his helmet. He has the nicest eyes I've ever seen, for real. - What colour? - Like, blue? Yeah, blue. But, like, deep-sea blue. That's so not a colour. Fuck off! It is if I say it is. What about Pascal? He has nice eyes too. Yeah, he's hot and he has good style. But Jean-Simon plays drums in a punk band. Fucking nice! - It's hot. - Yeah. Have you ever tried mesc? Mescaline? Good job! It's on your nose. You're so cute! You OK, Cat? Yeah. - It's the shit! - Seriously, it's the shit! You always repeat what she says! You're such a loser. Hey, your face is so fucked up. But I still got her pretty good. Whatever, you just fell down the stairs. She totally fell down the stairs! Seriously, she was crying. It was pathetic. So were you! Come on! What's wrong, Cat? You don't like mesc? No, I like it. It's cool. So, what? You snorted it and everything? Yeah. How was it? Honestly, it didn't do much. But it was still cool. I laughed. OK, I'll do the other one. I've heard that before. Apparently, you don't really feel it the first time. And Mélanie is into some guy who does motocross. - She's over Pascal. - No! Poser! What did she say? We gave you baking soda mixed with Rockets. Fucking poser. You ruined my life. Thanks a lot! Your principal is incompetent. And it was your idea to go see him. We had to do something! You should have stayed out of it! - We'll go to the police. - The police? You're such a moron! Show some respect. It's not my fault you're a moron. And there's no way I'm gonna live with you. I can't live with a fucking moron. Don't talk to me that way! Let go of me. This isn't over. Catherine, you stay right here! - Where's Mélanie? - She's not here. OK, but where is she? She's at Vanessa's watching The Lion King. You're such a loser! You can hang out with us if you want. You might even get to smoke a joint. - In three hours. - Yeah, in three hours. He's taking his sweet time. I'm a perfectionist, man! Finally, it's ready! Come on, light it. So, what do you think? A little tight, if you ask me. Well, you don't want it too loose. Yeah, but too loose is better than too tight. I have to disagree, Fred. Hey, man! You guys are such losers. The filter is fine, man. Then why do I have tobacco in my mouth? You're the only one. Seriously. Do you box or something? Run, run, run! You're OK? - This is it. - Yeah? That's some shack! Thanks for the lift. I didn't do much. So... are you still with Mélanie? I don't know. I mean, she's kind of intense. Ciao! Ciao, Flynno! - Hey. - Hey. - How's it going? - Good, you? Want one? Sure. - Thanks. - No worries. Is this a joke? No. No, it's not a joke. Come on! I'll have the cash tomorrow. I don't front. Man, I'm your girlfriend. Exactly. You gotta be careful not to do too much. Fuck you! You act all nice, but you're full of shit. Fred, pass the lighter please. Thanks. I want some. I have cash. Just let me put this down. Two bags? Sold. You couldn't have let me know? Oh, OK, so I still have to report back to you? You never think about other people! It's always me, myself and I. You wanted to leave? Then fucking leave. We'll be gone soon, and I can't wait. It sounds like waves. Waves? Yeah, listen. Waves pushing a boat against a dock. Pretty, isn't it? Like a tsunami. A giant tsunami! - Hi. - Hey! - How's it going? - Good. Did you bring your boombox? What do you think? Kev! What the hell are you wearing, man? Right. Fred and Pascal think he's gay 'cause of his tight jeans. But he's not gay! Flynn! Come here, boy! Softer. Like that. Where were you? The move was today. Wasn't it tomorrow? No, it wasn't tomorrow. I'll drive you. Apparently, you don't live here anymore. So... That's it. Well, bye. We'll call each other, OK? Yeah. We'll call. I'm sorry. I'll help. We have to be there for each other now. Careful! That's fragile. My stomach hurts. I think I'm getting my period. Aw, sweetie! Yeah, it really hurts. Drink your tea. A warm drink will help. I got it in Chinatown in Montreal. I know you like Chinese stuff. Here, this is yours. You know, some girls at school take the pill for their period pain. - It really hurts! - One, I'm not an idiot. Two, you're 16, so the answer is no. Drink your tea. It's ready. Can I at least dye my hair like Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction? Who? No, I don't want that there. Mia Wallace. She has black hair with straight bangs. - It's really nice. - But who is she? Dad's here. I can't find my Offenbach LP. You came all the way here for that? - It's my LP. - You don't even like them! Then why did I see them twice? That was me! Gerry invited me backstage. "Gerry invited me backstage." You're such a liar! You've never even been to a show. Let me find it, and I'll go. Leave her alone! Come here! It's my record. Can I just get my goddamn record? I want my Inuit soapstone sculptures. I paid for them. Well, I paid for the record. No, you didn't. I remember it clearly. I bought it at Music Hall. Let go of my stuff, OK? Half of this stuff is mine! You know why I remember? I was with Manon when I bought it. Well, you should have stayed with her. She's probably never heard of Offenbach. Stick your record up your ass! You're insane! I'll get the CD. I don't need your fucking trash! Get out! Goddammit! - Holy shit! - What? He gave me another $1,000 check. Motherfucker! Fucking piece of shit record! And where's my alimony? You're not getting a cent! It's for Catherine. Fuck you! I hate you! Stop it! Enough! Take a fucking Valium! Go fuck yourself! You can have it if you want. Is it from Quebec City? No, it's from the lake. Yeah, there's a new mescaline field in Lac Saint-Jean. Anyway, I don't know you. I don't sell to people I don't know. I just told you he's my boyfriend. Yeah, so? Then sell it to me. Same shit. Hey, this guy and his mescaline field! Listen, man, get your shit somewhere else. Marie, look. I think... I think the cops are over there. Cops, cops, cops! Go, go, go! Pigs! Pigs! Yes! Hi, Mrs. Leclerc! Yeah, it's... Is Frédéric there? No? I was just looking for him. OK. Thank you. It's fine. This place is so far! Yeah, I'm tired and my legs hurt. That's the point. The cops won't bug us there. OK, I gotta piss. - Come. - Yeah, me too. We'll catch up. Check it out! Where'd you get that? When the cops came yesterday, Fred tossed everything on the ground. I was like: "Shit!" You're gonna give it back, right? But he's your boyfriend. So? OK, let's go. We're coming! It's a fucking castle! It's huge! It's crazy! It's huge, man! Your dad did a good job! Yeah. It was a long time ago. Touch this. - It's soft? - So soft. That's my dad and my uncle. Cat, could you please come help us? - Thanks. - Of course! I'm gonna use my muscles! You have muscles? Of course I do! Cat? Can you come help me for a second? - What do you need? - Just hold the tarp. - There! - Like that. Careful. OK. Thanks. - Good job! - Thanks. Like this! How do you do it? - The tongue... - What? You roll it in. Come hang out with us! Smoke some fine marijuana. We have enough wood. Come here! He's good! He's good, but I think we have enough wood. So handsome! Huh, Catherine? Careful! Hey! You're hurting my savage heart The immigrant from the inside You're causing me a world of pain You're breaking my heart OK, quit freaking out. You're always worrying he'll get caught. Quebec City is far. Seriously, it's far. You gotta stop worrying, man. I'll call you back. You're so intense! What? You gonna tell me you have cancer now? Open it. If you don't want me to go to Dad's this weekend... Just open it, please. What is it? I bought them when I was 17. Are you serious? I want you to have them. - You're giving them to me? - Yes! - Seriously? - Yes! - For real? - It's real snakeskin. Real red snakeskin? You have to treat them with cotton balls and Vaseline. Oh my God! Wait! Careful! Snakeskin is delicate! - Gimme, gimme! - OK! They look great on you. I got them resoled, but you can't wear them in the rain and slush. They're awesome! Oh my God! If you wear them, bring a change of shoes and the case. - They look great on you. - They fit perfectly! You got them when you were 17? Yeah. You were cool, Mom! I look so good in these! Come. At your age, light makeup doesn't show. You don't have bags to hide. You have to be more bold. We'll do a '60s look, like in your movie, Fiction... - Pulp Fiction. - That's it. You know how? Jesus! You really think I'm an idiot, don't you? No, '60s is good. You're pretty. Fuck off! Looks good, huh? Oh my God! You look beautiful, for real. Thanks! Yep! You seriously look like you're 18. - Really? - Yeah. - It's soft! - It is. - Wait! - What? Look. Apparently, they're so dumb, they die if you scare them. - Seriously? - Yeah, that's what my dad said. You sure you wanna bring it to the camp? Yeah. The guys will fix it up. Little partridge! Is that a partridge? Nice, huh? Where's Pascal? Cat, look... Cat, wait. What are you doing? You're a fucking slut, Mélanie Belley! You hear me? You're a fucking slut! A dumb fucking slut! Pool! Catherine, you're late. We've been in the pool for, like, an hour. In your clothes? Come on. Come to bed. We wanna set up the tent. At this hour? It won't take long. I'll come help you. - We'll be fine. - Yeah. It's just a tent! Can you ricochet your spit? - Ricochet? - Wait! One... Two... Pascal is an idiot, though. Seriously. No, but if you're gonna cheat on your girlfriend, don't do it at the camp in front of everyone, you know? And he's a bad kisser! How would you know? I know! What? You made out with Pascal, and you never told me? We were just messing around. And it was really lame. You know, like... He is kind of... Like a snail. But you know what? It's not his fault. It's Mélanie's fault. If you spend a year making out with Mélanie Belley, obviously, you're gonna be bad at it. But Mélanie is a good kisser. Yeah? You're kidding. How would you know? You kissed Mélanie Belley? Seriously? What? What? Wait, you're leaving? Yeah. You can just wait for... The garbage men will pick you up with the trash and take you home. Do I smell like Belley? Is that why you're leaving? You smell like Belley. And you're making me wanna take a piss. - And is Keven a good kisser? - Keven? What's wrong with your face? You look like a larva! That's the Big Pot! No, it isn't! That's the Big Dipper. You have to find it when you're lost. Anywhere! Like, if I was at sea... Lower your fucking voices, girls! What's wrong with you two? Keep it down, goddammit! He looks like a clown! He's a clown! Fucking hell! What are you on? Did you see our tent? Christ! Goddammit! Out of the way! You're freaking out over nothing, Dad. We were low on oxygen from being in the tent. Low on oxygen? Fucking hell! Get in the house, now! And quit messing around. - What's going on? - Move it! - I caught them doing drugs. - What? Stay here. OK... I'm gonna go. Sorry, I... So that's why you wanted me to take Catherine this weekend. You can't even take care of your daughter one day per month. My daughter didn't do drugs before she came to live here. That's it. It's my fault. Easy one day... You're one to talk! What do we do about Catherine? She's your daughter, goddammit! Jesus! Some girl at school gave it to us. We were just trying it. Get over there, or I'm calling her mother. Mom, you're insane! It's freezing! I don't know what's going on here. But I didn't raise my daughter to do drugs. I was just trying it, OK? Relax! You'll end up a homeless drug addict. Is that what you want? I don't care. Can we go in? No, not yet. I'm grounded for two months. And no more money, except for my lunches. Well, it was cool of them not to call my parents. My mom's just afraid it'll make her look bad, like she can't even take care of her own daughter. If she finds any drugs, I'm dead. I'll be like the writer in Misery. Oh my God! I have chem. I'm gonna die! Thanks. Is it straight? You're not eating? I'm eating. You're just playing with your food. No, I'm eating. How's school? What do you mean? Well, how's it going? It's fine. It's a normal question. You just haven't asked me that in, like, ten years. You're funny, you know. You have a great sense of humour. Hey! Hi! - How's it going? - Good, you? Good. Can I take you home? My mom won't let you come in. No, I'll just take you home. - Like, to the door? - Yeah. - OK, I'm game. - Wanna hop on? - You're dead if you drop me. - I won't drop you. Ready? Being grounded is gonna make me go crazy. It just makes me wanna do more mesc. It's good to take a break sometimes. I hate not doing anything. I feel like I'm wasting my life. Like right now? Not now, no. How come? Well, you're here. But we're not doing anything. Yeah, but it's different. I have to get home. My mom's gonna freak out. I love your wrists. They're just wrists. I'd waste my life playing with them. Oh my God! I'm so happy you're here! I missed you so much, Marie! I brought you Keven's mixtape. Leave the door open. OK, girls? Yes. Thanks. Oh my God! Thank you. You're saving my life! You're doing some now? I rewatched The Crow with Fred and Jean-Simon yesterday. They never should have released it, out of respect. I don't agree. If they hadn't released it, he would have died for nothing. At least he died for a reason now. Well, we didn't even watch it. We drank the wine Mélanie's dad makes in his basement. It was gross. - Mélanie Belley? - Yeah. What were you doing with her? I don't know. She was there. Pascal too. Are they back together? Who gives a shit about Mélanie Belley? Hey, stop it, Cat! That's too much. Your mom's right there. She doesn't care. She won't notice. She's too absorbed in her own shitty life. To my mother! To my mother! Hello? So, this is my house. - Thanks. - You're welcome. It's not much, but... That's it? We don't even have milk. I'm dead. No, you're alive. You're so fucking beautiful. I know. What's your favourite colour of Froot Loops? Purple. You? I like the pink ones, but I like the green ones too. Good choice. Yeah. You OK? Dad, you're home? Yeah, I came for lunch. I didn't know you'd be here. - Catherine, right? - That's right. Glad to finally meet you. - Nice to meet you. - You too. It's a pleasure. Do you need a ride? I have my bike. We'll be fine. - OK, well, it was nice to meet you. - You too. Shall we? Bye, Dad! Bye. Hi! Hi! There's someone here to talk to you. This is my friend Martial. He's a friend of your father's. He's with the police. He has important stuff to tell you. It's for your own good. Hi, Catherine! As soon as you start hanging out in parks with the kids who do drugs, you're done for. We know who's selling and who's using. If you keep it up, you'll end up in here. Who takes the photos? We do. But you don't arrest them? They put all kinds of junk in the drugs you're buying. Excuse me. The guy selling you drugs doesn't care what he's selling you. He'll sell you anything. Some people even cut PCP with rat poison. Catherine, listen. Did you know that? No, I didn't. You wanna look like that? Pretty girl like you who has everything she wants in life. Catherine... No, I don't. Looks good. Thanks! I like purple flowers. Let me help you. Here. Take this. Grab the bucket and fill it up. You add some soil, then you can plant your flowers. - That went well, huh? - Great. Dad gave me some money. He said I can keep it. He trusts me. Can I? Well, if he gave it to you. Anyway, I think you can start going out again. What do you think? Well, obviously, I'm gonna say yes. I just don't want anything to happen to you. You understand? I understand. OK. - Thanks. - Yeah. Thanks a lot. - It's nice. - Isn't it? Belley's here, by the way. - Hey! - Hey. - So? - I'm gonna go. Relax, Belley. I'm not gonna hit you. Come on. Busted out of Alcatraz? Yeah, and I robbed a bank on my way here. Here. - Badass. - Thank you. It's crazy today. - Good one? - Yeah. Kitty Cat! Marie, don't call me that! It's so lame. - You're back! - Yes, I'm back! - I have something for you. - That's why we're here. Yes! That's why we're here. Yes! Give me one second. This is cut to .12, but it's still the shit. Seriously, I've never seen PCP this strong. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Apparently, there's a shortage of lactose. Of what? Lactose. - They cut mesc with it. - Isn't that milk? Probably 'cause everyone here got their PCP at the same time. Fuck! So crazy today. You got this! It's strong. Wow! Pass me the Slinky! Hey! I brought my Hole tape. Not in this house. She killed Kurt Cobain, you know. He might have asked for it. It's still great fucking music. A great fucking song. If he didn't want to live, that's up to him. Totally! So if the best musician of all time asked you to kill him, you'd do it? Yeah. They all die at 27 anyway, so whatever. It's like Yoko Ono, you know. - Fuck, Belley! - She was crazy too. It's gonna get all sticky. Kev, that's my sweater! Fucking bitch! Fuck! She's OD'ing. - What? - Yeah, she's overdosing. - Call the cops. 911. - No, no! She's gonna die on your floor. Call 911. No, not 911. Dude, no one call the cops. I've got $500 worth of drugs here. - We can't let her die. - No cops in my apartment. OK? Doesn't Mélanie have a truck? - We're going in! - No, we're leaving her here! What should we do with the truck? Leave it where it was. Outside my place? I don't think so. Who cares? Just leave it wherever. If she doesn't die, let's not forget to tell her where her truck is. Right. You're right. She was listening to a BB's tape, man! That ugly bitch! So ugly she could die! She's such a fucking loser! Apparently, a nurse found her on the sidewalk just in time. They pumped her stomach. She's gonna think she's so cool 'cause she got her stomach pumped. You could have brought her inside. Look, we had tons of drugs on us. What did you want us to do? - She could have died. - Well, she didn't. Fuck you, Belley! Cat, what are you doing? We have bio! Yeah. - Hi, girls! - Hi! It's just that... And, like... Whatever. Marie, listen. He wants to talk to you. Shut up! Catherine... Marie, check it out! - Looks good, huh? - It's so cool! Wait, it's uneven. - Cut more. - Yeah. Cut more! Keven, man, your shirt has been torn to shreds. Don't answer. It could be my mom. I never answer anyway. When does your dad get home, Kev? About 20 minutes. We have to hurry. If my mom catches me, I can't come to the party. Yeah, and you can't miss it. OK, I think it's good. It's super cool! It's nice! - I look good? - Yes! Spider-Woman! Sucks you don't have your snakeskin boots! No! You wouldn't. You look hot, man! - I like it. - You like it? - Should we go? - He likes it! - Yeah! Let's go. - Let's go! Oh my God, Cat! I have to play something for you. Wait. Keven, hand me your stereo! Thank you! I stole it from Belley's truck, man! Seriously? Fred, have you seen Keven? Found you! You're so handsome. Come dance with me. Come dance with me. - You know how I feel right now? - How? Like a cat. Put this on. The flies are gonna eat you alive. Oh, it's soft! I'm a cat! Cute, right? So are you. Did I do something wrong? I just feel like getting some air. Dance! Dance! Well, anyway... I love you. Let go of me! You're freaking out over nothing. It's just a party. We're not idiots. I just drank! Quiet! - Let go of me! - Come on! Seriously! Now get some sleep. Tomorrow, we're gonna have a long talk. Come on, Mom. It was just a party. It's Keven's dad. He wants to talk to you. Catherine? He really loved you. I couldn't go. It... Did you talk to his father? What happened? Why did he do it? Had he taken drugs? But he did them. Did you do drugs together? Because that's what drugs do. Listen. You don't just kill yourself at 16. I just want to understand. The last one's for Kev. Apparently, there were marks on the wall from his shoes. Like he tried to get back up. He must have been fucking suffering! - What do you have? - Just wait until I discard. - I know. - Yeah, well, you always forget. Catherine, it's your turn. I don't wanna play anymore. There's nothing else to do. It's pouring. OK, that's enough. - What are you doing? - Let's go. You catch more fish in the rain. - Now? - Yes. But it's raining. Come on, let's go. Get up! Come on! Come on! You know why they call it Cement Joe Lake? I don't know. They say there's a body at the bottom of the lake. He owed money to a loan shark in Jonquière. The loan shark tied him to a cement slab and tossed him in the water. But apparently... on a sunny day when the water's low, you can see the slab at the bottom of the lake. Here. I don't wanna hear about Cement Joe. Don't be a wuss. Cement Joe isn't going anywhere. But sometimes... the neighbour says he sees a strange man on the trail and... OK, let's go back. - Come on! I'm just joking, Catherine. - It's not funny. It was just a joke. Catherine... Let go of me! Catherine, enough! What's going on? You're such a fucking idiot. What is it? He's talking about some dead guy in the lake. Seriously? After what happened? - That's not it, OK? - What... - Let go of me! - Come here. It's OK, baby. Let go of me, please. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK, Catherine.
