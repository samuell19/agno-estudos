A suicide bombing took place again in a nightclub in Jakarta. As of now, the death toll has reached 150 people. The situation is heating up between white and black turban groups. Clashes occurred and claimed more victims of innocent civilians. Thousands of students and civilians marched on the streets to condemn the ongoing violence. The action actually worsened the situation and escalated the violence. Amateur footage leaked and quickly spread out on the Internet. The footage shows some law enforcers brutally executing hundreds of members of various religious hardline groups. All types of violence should be stopped. If I'm elected, I will make numerous new regulations. Participants of a peaceful march were giving away flowers on the street. They criticized the use of firearms by both the criminals and the state apparatus that are constantly crossing the line. We strongly condemn the use of any kind of murder weapon! A new rule banning the use of deadly live ammunition in the handling of any criminal activities is applied at every level of law enforcement. Law enforcers are only allowed to use rubber bullets which can only cripple their targets. It's time for Indonesia to change! May freedom prevail! 2026: THE REVOLUTION ENDED INDONESIA BECOMES A PEACEFUL, LIBERAL AND ANTI-VIOLENCE COUNTRY RELIGION HAS A BAD IMAGE IN THE EYES OF THE STATE AND COMMUNITY AS IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE RESPONSIBLE IN TRIGGERING WAR AND VIOLENCE HUMAN RIGHTS BECAME PRIORITY LAW ENFORCERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE LIVE AMMUNITION MARTIAL ARTS BECAME AN IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT FOR BOTH LAW ENFORCERS AND CRIMINAL OFFENDERS SOME PEOPLE HAVE MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS ABOVE THE OTHERS DISTRICT 2 What are you doing, Captain? Hey, kid. This really doesn't make any sense to me. Who knows if they are using live ammunition in there while we're out here using rubber bullets! But live ammunition is illegal, Captain. I just don't want to die in vain in there because of their live ammunition! Hey, kid. Arrest and immobilize anybody who walks out that door. Yes, sir. He is trying to get himself killed. Lieutenant Alif, the idealist and ambitious man. What can I do for you? Put those handcuffs on yourself. Let me change the question then. How much? How much should I pay you and your men? Money can't buy everything! Including our lives! The lives of people that you smashed and killed! That is what you buy and for what? Rank, position, or satisfaction? Are you sure you don't want to work for me? Calm down. Before you arrest me, I need you to listen to me first. I have a secret that no one else knows. I'm just like you. Just listen. I used to be an idealist too. I don't care about anything else. All I did was work for the nation and... Good evening, sir. The colonel wants to see you in his office. Thank you, sir. You have tremendous combat skills and talents. They're second to none and I admit it. But you can't keep going like this. We're working as a team here. Our team has an organizational structure, we have a chain of command, a line of orders. It was my captain, sir. He broke the rules, not me. Do you have any proof? How come you're the only one who saw him using live ammo? The Internal Affairs will charge you for the murder of Mr. Sunyoto. - But I didn't kill him. - I know that. But you didn't see who did it either, right? If he died in a fight because of an impact or bone fractures, it would have been tolerable! But the fact that he had live ammo in his head is a serious mistake! It's a severe violation of human rights. How will they charge me, sir? He was shot from outside the room and the gun was not even there! The gun was found in the room that you destroyed. I have taken you as my own son. I know you well inside out. Please try to compromise a little with the situation. This time, the potential punishment for you is not only demotion, but they can also put you in jail. You know that rank is not important to me. So what's important to you? Eradicating crimes! That's the most important thing to me! No matter how big of crimes you annihilated and no matter how many criminals you kill or arrest, it will never bring your parents back to life. Are we done here, sir? With a heavy heart, I shall have you suspended for two weeks. Alif, Mim! - Alif, your house is on fire! - Class dismissed. Dad? Dad! Calm down, Alif. - Dad! Mom! - Calm down! - Pull yourself together. - Dad! I seek forgiveness from Allah. Calm down. Dad! Please forgive me! Please forgive me! Let's get out of here! Let's go. You know I have the right to shoot anyone who breaks into my home. You can't hurt me with rubber bullets. You have become careless. It was so easy to break your security. I see that you're lacking training, Lam. I took you down in just a few moves. Have you forgotten that these days people fight using the Internet? Wars are done through mass media. The one with a strong network will prevail. Muscles and bullets are outdated. - This is it? - Yes. How many people did you kill today? Please don't make fun of people's lives. I thought you guys were making fun of other people's lives? - "You guys"? - The state's law enforcers. Those who have authority and license to kill. As long as it's done without a firearm. Cynical and skeptical notions towards law enforcers are back on trend? I thought it was a trend from 10 to 20 years ago. In every raid and crackdown on a crime, there have always been casualties of live ammunition. Last time I checked, live ammunition is illegal. They said that live ammunition is only used by the criminals, but why did it always end up in their heads? Last time I checked, you are a journalist, not a detective. Just write the news in front of you. There's no need to make assumptions that could trigger a tumultuous situation. Is that what you're really looking for to sell your newspaper? The criminal world is not as simple as depicted in movies and newspapers. What I have done all these years is simply for national security. Whoever reveals themselves as a threat to our people and nation, must be annihilated. Although at the expense of your own conscience? All of these... These are what keep me sane to this day. These help me to hold on fast to my conscience. Giving money to the families of the victims of your missions? For how much longer? How long do you think you can do something that you don't like and even disapprove of? How long will you let your mind clash with your conscience? When do they ever stop clashing with each other? Isn't that the true battle in life? DISTRICT 5 Please do me one more favor. I want you to find out about this person and their family. My specialty is to find out about people and yours is to kill them, right? It's beyond my office's interest and I can't use the office facility for this. Even when they made you like this? You know, I have been wondering. Usually, you have a TV in front of a couch, but why do you have a window instead? They say that television is a window to see the world and I have had enough of constantly being fooled by it. I decided to look directly out the window. Problem solved. I didn't know that skeptical notions towards journalism were back on trend. I thought it was a trend from 10 to 20 years ago. Don't be surprised by the data. I hope it's useful for you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. SUNYOTO'S PROFILE Hello. Hey, pretty girl. Smile for us. - Let me go! - Let's take her. Let's go. Let me go! Let's get out of here. Come on! Hey! Where are you going? Don't be surprised by the data. I hope it's useful for you. It has been 12 years, 4 months and 21 days. How long have you been in Jakarta? - Four years. - Four years? Why haven't you called me? I am... - I'm so ashamed of myself. - Ashamed? I'm not the person I used to be. And your husband? He's dead. But then I found out that he was a criminal. I was so fortunate that I was no longer with him before... Before he was killed by the law enforcers. What about you? I mean, how have you been doing? I see that you are a law enforcer in the special forces, right? You are young, handsome, masculine, and an amazing martial artist. I bet you have so many girlfriends. I don't have that feeling anymore. The feeling is gone when someone took it away 12 years ago. Go back to the time when everything was so simple for me. You don't have to regret anything, Laras. It's true that we can't change the past, but there's always tomorrow and we can change the future. - I don't have any future. - What are you talking about, Laras? - Everything is too late for me. - It's never too late for anything, Laras. That's what you used to say to me, remember? That's what encouraged me to join the special forces. Now I repeat the same words to you. You're the one who set a fire in my heart! And to this day, no one can put it out. Whatever your problem is, we can figure it out together. That's all that matters! Leave the other things behind. Alif... Hey, Alif. - I thought you were suspended. - I am. I came to get some of my stuff. CAN WE MEET AT CANDI CAFE TOMORROW AFTERNOON? LARAS Why are you smiling to yourself? Hey, look at him, guys. Alif is smiling! He's finally smiling! Knock it off. Any person who can make you smile, must be so special to you. That person is a hero for all of us. I mean it. You did something remarkable last time. Your boldness and fighting spirit have raised our morale. The most important thing is we were able to go home to our families safely. It was all thanks to you. - Are you guys ready? - Yes, sir! Where are you going? District 9. We have to exterminate bad guys there. You know, terrorists in religious robes. You kill one, ten will rise in his place. They should be destroyed to their roots. To their families or even their offspring! So there's no more religious terrorists in our country. Religion will only create a chaotic situation. Take care of yourself, Bima. Yes, Captain! I'm still First Lieutenant, just like you. You'll be a captain next year, right? - Come on. - Okay. Okay. Why did they lock down our school? It's a revolution, Mim. This school is deemed a threat to national security. Use your skills to defend this country! Master, are you joining the recruitment of the civil army? It's all of you who still have the opportunity to join them. I'm too old for that, but I will do everything I can. Goodbye! I can't stay here! I must find my family's murderers! So you're going to join the recruitment? Yes, I want to serve this country. I'm going to be a law enforcer. I'm just going to continue my writing about the truth. So my readers can understand the real meaning of truthfulness. I only want a simple thing. To die in the state of righteousness. I want to stay here and devote my life to spreading virtue through religion. DISTRICT 9 Allah has willed it! Don't move! It seems like you have anticipated our arrival. Arrest him! You're proven to be an anarchist and to have a thug mentality. Just leave and take your men with you before their internal injuries and broken bones get worse. Zealots like you are nothing but a disease to this country! Violence is the only language you people understand! You're selling your own religion! How much did the locals here pay for your thug service? You hypocrite! Send my regards to your prophet! Just go. Go home to your family. DISTRICT 7 Lam? Mr. Chandra wants to see you in his office. - Congratulations. - For what? I received an email from Libernesia London last night. They asked me to discuss your last month's writing on Atambua's Indigenous People. They said they wanted to put you as one of this year's award nominees. - What's wrong? - Nothing, it's just... - But they have a request. - That's what I'm talking about. They want you to write about the drastic development of modern civilization in this country specifically on same-sex marriage that has been ratified here and has rampantly taken place in the last ten years with your writing style on Atambua. A writing style with a dramatic point of view. Do you want me to lie to them? What do you mean? My writing on Atambua's Indigenous People is based on my personal point of view. It's congruent with my conscience. Maybe that's what made it so dramatic and touching. The indigenous people there don't care at all about the perfection of Western civilization. - In fact, they... - Lam. Be careful when you mention the word "West." You could be deemed as a racist or even an extremist! I stand corrected, sir. I should say, "Modern Civilization." The point is, I can't write something contradictory with my conscience. Come on, Lam. We have to be objective in our work. You can't work simply by using your feelings and heart. Let alone from your religious point of view. We are working in a news office, not the Ministry of Religious Affairs! You should change your point of view, Lam! I'm sorry, maybe Yoga or Sekar is more suitable for this assignment. I have told you so many times, you are one of our best journalists here. But if you continue to work in an old-fashioned way... - Hello? - one day you'll have to choose... What is it? - When? - Lam! - Now? - Lam! - The Headmaster? - Lam! Yes, sir? - Are you done, sir? - Yes, I am. Here's the thing, sir, ma'am. Gilang's case here is different from that of other students. Gilang's enemy is not other students, but the teachers. Today alone, he had five teachers made fun of by all the students. Do you have proof that Gilang did it? I don't think we need proof. Gilang didn't deny it when he was asked whether he did it or not. The question is if I have been proven guilty, not about me admitting to it. - Gilang. - Be quiet. I believe you often get compliments because of Gilang's intelligence. That's for sure and I acknowledge it. Perhaps Gilang got answers to the exam from the school's computer server. Or maybe he changed his own test scores favorably. That's why his test scores are always good. I know the direction of your conversation, sir. So how about this? I apologize for my son's impudence. Let me talk to him about this. Can you turn it off? You can't, ma'am. It's from the school's server. - Give it to me. - What? Your PC. I wasn't using my PC, just my cell phone. Okay, then give it to me. You can use your knowledge for good things. But this kind of action, it's conceited and illegal. They insinuated you too often in front of the class. Me? Why me? They started to act like that since Mr. Toni saw you praying in the school's basement. Gilang. Do you feel ashamed that we offer prayers? - It's okay, we can do it... - No, Dad. I don't feel ashamed. I'll offer my prayers in front of the class tomorrow! You don't have to do that. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. He used his cell phone. At his age, I could only use my cell phone for browsing. Are you happy or worried that Gilang has hacked his school's server? I'm just confused as I have never taught him how to do that! Laras? Alif? What are you doing here? You asked me to come here, remember? I did? You sent me a text message. You can continue your work as usual. - I'll wait for you here, okay? - No! I have a long shift today. You'd better go now. I hadn't seen you for 12 years. Just to see you working from here would be good for me. - Alif... - I'll wait here for you. Laras. All praises be to Allah. - Let's sit over here. - Okay. Let's order right away. - Waitress! - All praises be to Allah. - We would like to order... - Excuse me, Gentlemen... As you can see on the sign over there, no religious talks or outfits here. That's the regulation of our management. We just came here to eat some halal food. We're hungry and we will fully pay for the food that we order. I'm sorry, but you can come back here after you change your clothes. Silly regulation, telling us how to dress! - We want to order... - Sir. - Stop pulling the menu. - I want to see it. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. I know none of you mean any harm, but it's better for everyone to obey the rules here. In order to maintain this conducive situation, I suggest you guys to get your food and drinks in another restaurant. - Do you mean that you want us... - I'm sorry. Okay. Come on, guys. Excuse us then. Let's just go home. Once again, I'm so sorry. I don't mean any harm. I just want the best for all and that we all respect the applicable rule. It's funny, don't you think? They say that this is a liberal country. The country that provides freedom for its people, but they prohibit us from having religious talks and dressing like this. Maybe the freedom is excluded for religious people like us. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Sir! Sir! Sir! Laras... Alif? Do you know what my name means? No. What is it? My mom used to say that... Laras means straight. As straight as my name, "Alif"? "Alif" is written with a straight line. How come it's the same? "Alif" and "Straight". You're right, they're both vertical. Maybe we're meant to be together. What do you mean by "maybe"? It's for sure. Don't be so sure about it. Go and ask permission from your friend first. Who? Herlam? Not Herlam, but Mimbo. - How do you know Mim? - Who doesn't know him? There he is. Mim? What is he doing here? Laras? Alif, what's happening to me? Laras, what's wrong? Alif... Alif! Investigating the bombing that took place in Candi Cafe at 3:42 p.m. yesterday. By 7:00 p.m... How is Alif doing now? He was fine, but Laras was inside the cafe. Who is Laras? Alif's ex-girlfriend. You don't know her. However, based on some solid evidence found, it's indicated that the bombers were from radical Islamic groups. Some witnesses... Which group will become their scapegoat now? I'll turn it off. Seeing such news before eating makes me nauseous. What would you do if they name your cousin as the suspect? Mim is not a terrorist and you know that. It's just false news, right? We can't judge it as false news if we don't have any evidence. The people on television were easily throwing accusations at someone by saying "indicated". Do you know the meaning of "indicated"? It means allegations that have been spread everywhere, but it hasn't been proven yet. What's the news supposed to say then? - Just tell it as it is... - Here we go again. without saying "indicated" like my teachers did at school. Why do I always get stuck in an old men's conversation? The old lady is complaining. I seek forgiveness from Allah! Honey! Stop laughing and eat your dinner! Come on and eat! ODDITIES IN THE CAFE CANDI BOMBING BY HERLAM LAW ENFORCERS SUSPECTED THAT THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN A BAG LEFT BEHIND IN THE CAFE BY SOME RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. Sir, those people... - Where are we on the cafe bombing? - I'm still working on it. I went to the cafe and found a new clue. It's okay, just drop this one. We have released the news. - We have? - Yes. Yoga made the summary and we just released it on the Internet. LIBERNESIA NEWS RELIGION SPREADS TERROR AGAIN RELIGION SPREADS TERROR AGAIN The chronology is not that simple, sir. There's still a lot of missing pieces. My source is a law enforcer who was at the crime scene at that time. This is also coming from a law enforcer. They came and delivered it to me. They were here for more than an hour until we released the news. A colonel delivered the press release to us by himself and sat by Yoga's side for an hour while he was working on the summary? I have got a new clue and I'm this close to finding out the motive, sir. Other news offices don't know about this. I'm just pursuing the fact here. So your fact is more accurate than the law enforcer's? It's not like that. I want you to leave for Bromo the day after tomorrow. No arguments. Why do you always send me out to cover other news every time I try to cover a terrorist case? Bontang, Kabanjahe, Atambua, and now Bromo. Do you still offer prayers? What does my writing have to do with my prayers? You know that other media can bully us at anytime after they somehow got your picture offering prayers! You know what happens to a media which is deemed to be fanatic! Fanatic? I'm the fanatic? It takes only one core employee with conservative ideology to cause the pullback of all investments from any kind of big company! Libernesia was established by bringing the idea of freedom! Freedom from dogmatism, radical, and religious doctrines! We'll be totally devastated if other media attack us with our own weapon! As long as you still offer prayers, you won't be objective in working on a criminal case perpetrated by your own people! We can't afford to keep a criminal here. If I'm such a bad criminal, why are you keeping me here? Who said so? I have told you so many times if you're still working in an old-fashioned way, I'm giving you options to either resign or get fired! NO ENTRY Hey! Laras? What is this? Why did you try to give this to me? Please do me a favor, Lam. It's not the way to ask for a favor! Because I know you're the only one who can help me! Hey! What's going on here? The number you are calling is not active or is out of service area. Please try again in a few moments. ODDITIES IN THE CAFE CANDI BOMBING BY HERLAM Go to sleep. You're working so hard writing articles about terrorists, aren't you afraid your office will reject it again? Actually, it has been rejected. So why are you still on it? It seems like yesterday's bombing case has something to do with Mim's school. What do you mean? I saw the Crime Lab Team found an Alattar perfume bottle at the crime scene. Honey... Since we were kids, none of us ever condoned such bombing tradition. From Hiroshima and Nagasaki until the bombing of Candi Cafe. Kyai has never taught us such a thing, but we have to be fair to the facts. Even though Mim is my best friend and also your cousin, we can't defend him just like that, we have to see the factual truth. Are you sure it's not the law enforcers themselves put the bottle there? They were even confused with the bottle and where it came from. Maybe Alif doesn't know either. I know that it's a community product from Mim's school. There's no way someone in here took the product from there. It had to be someone inside the school that brought the product here. There are too many oddities in this case. Let alone the premature press release made by the law enforcement. Sooner or later, they will know that Alattar perfume is from Mim's school. They will raid it. Alif and Mim shouldn't be on two opposite sides. They never compromise with the truth they hold fast. You really never give up on looking after the relationship between Alif and Mim. If you had to choose between me and Gilang. Who would you choose? What are you talking about? Mr. Chandra gave us tickets to Bromo. He wants me to cover the news there. But if we go to Bromo, it means that I have to stop working on this case. As usual, they silence me from seeking the truth by assigning me to a remote area. Libernesia doesn't want their statement to contradict the law enforcement. All they want is to paint the Islamic scholars as terrorists. They don't want to know about the facts that I pursue. What is the correlation between this case and you with Gilang then? This time they want me to choose, go to Bromo or resign. I'm not ready to lose in this ordeal. - Gilang? - Son? Why are you still awake? I'm just thirsty, Dad. Lam. Do you remember what you said to my dad when you proposed to me? I never forget it. You asked my dad's permission to take me by your side in your struggle for the rest of our lives. You didn't give him a guarantee that you would make me happy, but to struggle together with you. That turned out to be the reason he approved of you. Actually, I was quite shocked when you said about resigning last night. But how can you take a stance while you're afraid of losing your job? If you're afraid of not having money and worried about me and Gilang, it means that you don't give us a chance to stick with you in your struggle. This is your chance to prove yourself as a role model for Gilang. So he can see how his dad takes a stance and that he has a dad with an incisive conscience who always seeks a fair judgment to know which one is right and which one seems to be right. I don't want to be a wife who makes her husband deaf to his own heart. You are the only one who can teach me not to merely rely on money and not to be afraid of the world. ODDITIES IN CANDI CAFE BOMBING, DRAFT What are you trying to do, Lam? Amazing. Resignation requested and approved instantly. Other employees can only resign after undergoing one or two months' notice. Can I borrow your access, Pras? My access has been blocked. Come on, Lam. This era has been a lot better than the Revolution era back then. Posting idealistic writings in spam is outdated now. What spam? What did they call us before the revolution era? Provocateurs. Now when they need us, they call us Revolutionists. If you continue being so idealistic, you'll become an extremist. Knock it off. It's not our time now. Just enjoy everything you have got now. I don't know what you're talking about! People want you to stop investigating the bombing case because they don't want you to have a confrontation with law enforcers. Don't you feel it's weird that your resignation is approved instantly? Like those people, I want you to stop investigating the bombing case because I care about you, but now you spread spam on your last day here! - What spam? - I tracked down the spam, Lam! The more you deny it, the more I feel unrequited to care about you! I just need access to the office's server to decrypt a file! Just for your information some of our fellow journalists received your spam and deleted it at once, so their Editor in Chief wouldn't see it. There are only a few of us who still care about you. We have to take good care of them. Hopefully, their pain can erode their sins. Yes, Kyai. The most severely injured of all is the leader of the squad. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Peace be upon you, sir. Peace be upon you too. We are all confused and just wondering. All those people lying down over at the infirmary, they all wanted to kill us. They open fire on you. But instead, why do we give them treatment and not punish them for what they have done? What rights do we have to punish them? This is our territory. We have the right to enforce the Islamic Law in our own territory. This is the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. This is an evil country! A satanic country which doesn't believe in God! Seek forgiveness, Wan. Don't let your passion become your basis to do the right thing. Because that will eventually become your justification. You should not forget. My dad, my brother, they got executed by those assassin squad they sent without any pleadings, without any trials and with no one taking responsibility for it. Patience. Obedience. Sincerity. Where is Doctor Ali? He's out to get medicines and equipment from the pharmacy. We have to take immediate action for this one. Do you mean surgery? There is a severe case in his internal wounds. We have to fix it immediately. Get the concoction that I have prepared in my office. Okay, Kyai. Forgive me. Kyai! Kyai, there's cops everywhere. They're at the front gate. Attention! We have surrounded this place! You'd better give up! Hand over your leader in this instance! Hold them off for now. Don't let them in and see all of this. Forgive me, Kyai. But wouldn't it be better if they see what we have been doing to them? They're not ready, Mim. The status of these men we're treating here has been compromised. If they return, they will be interrogated and maybe even tortured. They won't be trusted anymore. Understood, Kyai. Hurry up! They are building an army. Your friend here is the Warlord. Meanwhile, the Islamic leader, Kyai Haji Mukhlis is their supreme leader. That bomb is the same one that they used to blow up Candi Cafe. - There's still more evidence... - When did they take this picture? Last week. Why didn't you annihilate them directly at once? Why wait until there are victims here? Lt. Bima and his team were on that mission but failed entirely. Apparently, they were more prepared. Our men who managed to escape was severely injured. Some had concussions and broken bones. As for Lt. Bima, he hasn't returned until this very moment. There's a chance that he didn't survive. - Why wasn't I enlisted, sir? - You were suspended! We were concerned that your relationship with this man would become a conflict within yourself. - Is the evidence reliable? - Very reliable. A perfume which is usually worn by their community and a bag that was deliberately left on the premises. THE ODDITIES OF THE BOMBING. BY HERLAM Sir, no matter who it is, if they're a criminal, a terrorist, a threat to the people of this country, I will destroy him! An hour ago, Captain Rama and his men have already ambushed the school. But they weren't able to enter. The only entrance is guarded by this man. His martial arts skill is remarkable. None of our men was able to defeat him. It appears that he is immune to rubber bullets. Fire at will! These are desperate times. The good name of our squad is at risk here. You saw it yourselves! This is what happens when we are not authorized to use live ammunition! Do you see that? We could have gunned them down with live ammunition or disintegrate them. But the media and press are all over the place. They're waiting for us to make another mistake. Do you see that now? For us to once again violate the human rights. I will complete this mission, sir. If you are able to apprehend Kyai Haji Mukhlis, your charges for the murder of Mr. Sunyoto will be dropped. Hey, kid! AL-IKHLASH SCHOOL Thirty-seven people have been killed and 15 people were badly injured. Is that your definition of Jihad? Did you know that Laras was inside that cafe? Or did you intentionally kill her? So this is how the law enforcement of this country works? Attack first, ask questions later. Maybe it works in other places, but not here. I'll give you two options, Mim. You hand over your leader or you all die here! This is my home, Alif. I will defend it even if I have to sacrifice my own life for it. So this is what you meant by dying in the state of righteousness? Sacrificing yourself to defend your own home as if we're the bad guys who are invading you? - Just do what you have to do. - I will definitely do it, Mim! For the sake of Laras, Bima, and everyone that you have killed. I'll make sure that your death will be far more tragic than theirs. My life and death only belong to Allah. Stop! You don't know anything, Alif. Don't let them toy with you. - Them? - This is our Kyai! He helped you out when your house was on fire. Alif. How have you been, young man? Fine, Kyai. What are you guys doing here? Essentially, you are both brothers. We are no longer brothers since you have been bombing the whole town. - Alif! - Mim. Did you bring a warrant for my arrest? Go ahead. You may arrest me. - Kyai. - Mim. This is an official letter from the state. We must obey it. Strengthen the front line. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. In less than 20 years, 232 places of worship have been transformed into warehouses. The defender of the minority sells the freedom logo. Once they became the majority, they condescended the minority even more. Whoever disturbs the freedom is labeled as a criminal. It doesn't mean that only the government is the bad guy. Then who is the bad guy? Kyai? Lam, I also don't want Kyai to go to jail. He's covering up for someone. If he didn't do that, maybe one of us, Mim or I would be dead by now. How many people did you apprehend from the school? Why didn't you just disband them? The mosque would make a good warehouse. Why do you judge the law enforcer very dishonorably? Do you know what's the strongest Intel for the approval of the raid? - What? - Here. The Alattar perfume! My writing? Yes, that's your writing that you spammed everywhere. I would never expect that you would provoke the bombing case and the school to the press. You keep on defending Mim in front of me while pointing my gun at his head. Do you know who pays the price? It's Kyai. Now two people are accusing me of spamming. This writing is still a draft, unfinished. It's impossible for me to release it. Where did you get this? From my headquarters. Never mind, it's not important anymore! I can't determine what's right or wrong anymore. I'm blind now. Facts are not as simple as the criminal world. The visuals in this world move in a 3D format. You have to see one spot from many different angles. Now it's time for you to take off those blinders. I met Laras yesterday. - You speak of nonsense now? - I called you to tell you this. She's still alive. Very much alive. She gave this to me. I don't know what's inside. I can only open it from my office. Here. Mr. Sunyoto's data that you have requested. I have one advice for you. Stay away from Laras. Neither you nor I know who she really is. SUNYOTO'S DATA Corporal Bambang Mudiono was killed in an ambush 30 years ago. The name Sunyoto emerged ten years later as a supplier and dealer of firearms. Also as a high-class call girls' agent, slave supplier and drug dealer. It's the same thing. Damn, it's so nicely done. This is the work of a hacker. Decrypted? Twelve minutes ago? - Yes? - Check your video. - I'm driving right now. - Just do it. You've got to see this. - It turns out that the file from Laras... - You said it was encrypted? It was. Someone decrypted it 12 minutes ago before I arrived here. This hacker has no manners, going in and out of my server. I'm sure it's the same guy that has been doing all that spamming of my writing. The history log says I'm the first one to open this file. He just decrypted it. Lam, I don't get what you're saying. The file that Laras gave me contains the CCTV footage of the bombing at Candi Cafe. CCTV? Wasn't the server at the cafe blown away? That's what I thought as well. Check this out. You got to see this one. One minute before the explosion at the back alley of Candi Cafe. Laras? Why did she expose herself by giving me this file? Where are you right now, Lam? In my office. I'm connected to my own personal server at home. You should disconnect from your office and don't connect anywhere. You just go home! I have a really bad feeling about this. Hold on. I have almost locked the hacker's position. I must find him before... Lam! Oh my God, Gilang. Gendis? It's you the one who can teach me to not be afraid of the world. Forgive me... Forgive me... Forgive me, Gilang. I just wanted you to be smart. I didn't mean for it to be like this. I just wanted you to be smart. Forgive me. I have made a mistake. I want to go with you, son. I want to go... Oh Allah, I want to go with them. I want to go with them. Please, Allah. Please take my life. I want to go. Lam! - Gilang? - Dad. Hang in there. Hang in there. Alif, help me! We need to get to the car now! - Where are we heading, Lam? - To the school. Why not the Emergency Room? It's open 24 hours. To the school! Oh my God! What happened to Gilang, Lam? Quick, go to the infirmary! - Doctor! - My goodness! - What happened? - Sorry, you have to wait outside. I am his dad. - Stop here, Lam. - I want to be with him. - Lam... - Patience. Just wait here, okay? Just sit over there. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Here's your water, sir. Here's the straw. Peace be upon you. Here is your water, sir. - Here's the straw. - Thank you. Peace be upon you. Here's your water. Here's the straw. Bima. Are you okay? I would have been dead by now. I can't determine anymore who is wrong... and who is right. If God wills it, my younger cousin died as a martyr. How is Gilang? Thank God the bullet has been taken out. Dr. Ali gave him the concoction that Kyai made. If God wills it, he will recover soon. This... This is what Gendis always wanted since she was a little girl. Harmony. All kinds of different sects and religious streams united in one space, with nobody having a quarrel or any self-righteousness to themselves. They are gathering here because there isn't any space left outside. They don't have a choice. One by one, they destroy every place of worship. This Islamic boarding school will be next on the long list. Isn't that right, Alif? Isn't all of this enough to make us feel grateful? Who built all of this? Kyai did. Now he's in jail because of a false accusation. Now we have to do nothing and just be grateful? The perpetrators are still out there. Maybe will do the same thing to other people. Do we have to do nothing and just be grateful? Rama. Captain Rama did this. This live ammunition bullet shell is from his weapon. Perhaps to Gilang, but Gendis's body was destroyed by what looked like an inner energy punch. Are you sure that Rama is capable of doing that? Then we have to find out. Do you know where he lives? What are you guys planning to do? - Playing vigilante? - Yes. Are you just going to do nothing? - Lam, vengeance will only destroy... - This is not about vengeance! If God wills it, I can accept that this is the end of Gendis's struggle. But this isn't my end yet. Just apprehend and hand him over to the law enforcers. Mim, Captain Rama is the law enforcer. Me too. After all of this, do you still believe in the law enforcers? Islam is not a religion of treason. Islam never taught us to become a rebel. They even imprisoned your teacher who is just a doctor and a botanist. Do you still plan to do nothing? We have prepared the best lawyer. Let the court decide it. - He would never reach the court. - I'm sure they'll kill him. It's the same pattern. Either they kill him behind bars or on his way there. Just like they did the other scholars. It's Colonel Mason. He wants to meet me tomorrow. You may go. Leave us alone. Captain Nayla. Is the title "Captain" that important to you, Dad? Can't you just call me Nay? Just like any other normal dad and daughter. Indeed, we are not normal. We are special people. Captain. Do you know what you have done? Don't you know... that you have just killed an entire family? Why? Why did you do that? That's unacceptable. Nobody can get out. This is all because of Alif, isn't it? Apparently, this virus has severely damaged your brain. Love... Love is a deadly virus. Have you received the visuals? - I got it. - Audio? Clear. It's automatically saved on the server. Where did you get this equipment from? It's an old toy when reporters still had the freedom to report the correct news. As for now, the punishment is more serious than murder. - Peace be upon you, sir. - Peace be upon you too. Hey! You blew up Candi Cafe! Just admit it! - God has mercy! - Alif. - I swear that I didn't do it! - Let him go. Mim, they were at the scene that day. - They deliberately left their bag there! - That's not what happened. Give them a chance to explain. I have told Mr. Mim before. We were asked to go there by a prospective buyer for our produce. We didn't want to go to that place, but he requested it! - God have mercy. - Calm down. I was also about to offer him the Alattar perfume made by Mr. Uta. But when this gentleman asked us nicely to leave, we took off. - Isn't that right? - Right. I also left my bag over there. It only contained papers about produce and perfume samples. You heard that yourself, Alif. So what's the meaning of this? It was just a coincidence? I never believe in coincidences. The law enforcer should too. They were set up to go there, including you. Just go there right now and let's prove this together. I must go to the press conference today. Someone has to escort Kyai. As you both said, he has to live until he reaches the court. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Heaven awaits us. If God wills it, your dad and brother are already waiting for you up there. AL-IKHLASH SCHOOL AL-IKHLASH SCHOOL Where are we going? The Colonel ordered me to pick you up and take you to his favorite restaurant. It's not far from the Headquarters. Why not at the Headquarters? They said that the place is being used for the press conference. - So he's not attending the conference? - No, sir. Only the ranks of Generals are asked to attend. They said that the ranks of Colonel may take a break. Marwan? - Peace be upon you, sir. - Peace be upon you too. What are you doing here? Mr. Samir told me to go here. He told me to monitor the situation and also accompany you here. Mr. Samir didn't say anything to me. It was a last-minute request. He was very concerned. Excuse me. I need to go to the toilet. - Back off! - Mim! Get back! Stay back! Alif, have a seat. Come, let's have a drink. This is called the White Tea. It's extremely rare and full of nutrients. Please have some. I'm sure you know Laras. She is one of the best agents that this nation has ever had. Hey, I need you to watch this for me. But what should we do with it? Lam! I'll give you 30 minutes to ask questions. Mr. Kyai, what is your motive behind the bombing of Candi Cafe? I don't have any motive, because I didn't do it or ordered anyone to do such bombing. I'm still innocent, I haven't been proven guilty. It's as if you had been brainwashed. Apparently, you can no longer define which is right and which is wrong. Did you blow up the Candi Cafe? Now this is Alif that I have known, straight to the point. No, I didn't. It was done by professionals. But I did order the bombing. Why? Why not? So that's your reason for killing tens of innocent people there? Innocent? There were 12 political rats who were planning a coup d'état strategy. There were 15 college students who adhered to the communist ideology. There were ten children of corruptors who owned illegal businesses. There should have been three more dead terrorists if you hadn't kicked them out. They were just students who were there to sell produce and perfume. They are a disturbance in society! They are Muslims, right? They wore robes, thobes, turbans. They're terrorists! Kyai, since you were apprehended, many religionists are demonstrating by taking off their robes. Like what you're doing right now, not wearing a robe or a thobe. Is this an instruction from you to make them invisible, therefore giving a hard time for law enforcers to monitor their movements? I have never made any kind of instructions for them to wear any kind of clothing. My outfit is always like this. But why do most of your students wear robes or thobes? It's their rights and freedom to choose. So all this time, we are the bad guys? Under the leadership of Colonel Mason. You were the one who created this plot? I'm just following orders. Someone ordered me to do it. Whoever ordered you, must have had so much hatred towards religion. As for this one question of yours, maybe someone can assist me in answering it directly. What do you mean? Alif. This one kid of yours is so naive. So you're his superior? Superior or subordinate, it all depends on how you see it, Alif. What matters is that we're all brothers. I like... I'm sorry. We like your performance. You have an outstanding personality. But unfortunately, there is one flaw in you that is hard to remove. Really? You still believe in God. That's what crumbles everything. You haven't answered my question. I don't hate religion. If we wanted to demolish it, we could have done that a long time ago. In fact, we support the rebirth of all religions along with their militia. They create a sect over here, a militia over there, we create causes and get the effects. That's what we do since hundreds of years ago. This is our game. We need enemies, war, chaos, and all of these fanatics for what? To preserve the balance in this world. So that everyone upholds the value of peace. So that everyone is grateful for the things they have. This is our duty and it should have been your duty too. Like the duty that you have given to Corporal Bambang? He was an agent who'd gone rogue. We were unable to control him anymore, so he should be annihilated. His teachings have gone off the line which we had set. Because religion shouldn't accept divergence. Religion should teach resentment and they didn't do that. We should be the one who provide peace, not them. They could destroy the balance that we have built all this time. I will do anything for the sake of that balance. For the sake of creating the most supreme government in this world. For the sake of perfecting the human civilization. For the sake of happiness of the entire nation. For the sake of creating their heavenly paradise right on this very planet. Not the false heaven that sits on your cloud of imagination. That's the false heaven that is told in children's fairy tales. I'm sure what's on your mind right now is that we are a group of devils who are creating war and causing chaos, right? Killing people as we wish. The devil is a being who is closest to God. Who is most obedient to the functionality and orders of God. Where else are you planning to blow up? Hey, Lam. Which family are you planning to slaughter next? Peace be upon you, Lam. How are you, my brother? We just wanted to open your eyes so that you can see the truth. What kind of truth? That this country is getting really messed up. That this country must be destroyed? For the sake of God, for the sake of Islam, we must strive, Lam. Who do you think you are? A person who is infiltrating the law enforcer or a double agent? - This is absurd. - Listen to me, Lam. We are not what you think we are. You saw it for yourself, right? How this country annihilated your whole family, Lam. Come on, Lam. Please join us. Please help us. Give your help to your religion. The only way I can help my religion, is by breaking your neck. You're a good husband, you have taught martial arts to your wife. So you're the one who killed her? What's wrong? Feeling dizzy? Are you having a hard time breathing? The poison is on that cup, not inside the tea. Because in about two minutes there will be a huge explosion that will... Who is your leader? What is your next plan? Spit it out! You're too late, Lam. - Spit it out! - You have already lost. Spit it out! Mim. So it does not rule out the possibility that the bomber could be your students. - Who has executed... - Allah is the Greatest! - A bomb! - Get him! Who sent you here? Where did you get... Mim. Just worry about yourself first. You only have 12 minutes left. The cleaners are already standing by. Check the situation at the Headquarters. Clean up the rest of those people, including those seven Generals. Yes, sir. Generals? It is time for me to get promoted. Let those arrogant Generals who are not willing to join us, die with a heavy load of decorations. Heroes are needed in a revolution. It's good then, okay? Wait! Am I included as one of the targets in Candi Cafe? You are no longer controllable. Your death can wipe out the virus inside this agent's mind. Her real name is Nayla. She is my daughter. It should have been her who executed that bombing in Candi Cafe. It should have been. Hey, what do you mean? First strike, she ignored the bombing mission in Candi Cafe. Second strike, she leaked confidential data. What is this? She knew that we were going to poison Alif. She was prepared with this antidote. What are you doing? Laras! You both will decide which one of you will live and which one will die. Peace be upon you. Where did Herlam go? Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Destroy any connections from that school. Kill anyone who interferes. Understand? - Kyai! - Mim! Kyai! We have to get out of this place. It's no longer safe here. What are you saying, Mim? Even though I'm not guilty, I won't allow you to free me from this place without the law's approval because dirt cannot be purified with more dirt. Who blew up that bomb? It was Marwan, Kyai. One of the refugees. God has willed it. We let our guard down. Our front line wasn't strong enough. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Hey! What are you doing? Master? Mim, why did you choose to become a terrorist? I'm not a terrorist. Why did you kill them? This has been my duty all this time. Keeping peace in this world. It's you the real terrorist here! I'm sorry, but I don't have much time. It has been 12 years. Why do you use the name Laras? The Colonel asked me to take care of you. To him, you were a very valuable asset. Is it true about what he said? This... This should have never happened. Or maybe this is exactly what should happen. Alif, I... Hurry up and take this antidote. I don't ever want to see you die again, Laras. Absolutely not. Mim! Now I know why I learned martial arts. May God have mercy! Now this is what I call a real bullet. No, sir! Calm down! Shut up! So apparently this kid is still alive! This time, I'll definitely kill you! Allah is the greatest! God have mercy. Carry on. Laras. Hold on. Let me look for the antidote. Alif. Kyai! Mim! That's enough. We are not killers. Did you blow up the Candi Cafe? Now this is Alif that I have known. Straight to the point. I didn't do it. It was done by professionals. But I did order that bombing. We need war, chaos, and all of these fanatics for what? Balance. Even though I'm not guilty, I won't allow you to free me from this place without the law's approval. But I did order the bombing. Hey! What the heck? Hey, you! Islam began as something strange and will go back to being strange. So glad tidings of paradisebe for the strangers. Lieutenant Alif. You think you have won?
