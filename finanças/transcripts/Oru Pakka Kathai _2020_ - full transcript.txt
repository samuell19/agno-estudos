'He is Sethu.' 'For the past few days, he has been doubting...' 'whether he is the avatar of God, or not.' 'In this story, we will get to know' 'if he is really an avatar.' - Sethu! Sethu, come upstairs. You still haven't brushed your teeth. King Parikshit asks sage Shuka... 'You told everything about the two dynasties.' He said, 'You revealed the history about the kings' 'from Soma dynasty and Surya dynasty.' He asked King Parikshit if it wasn't interesting. He said, 'You skipped the story of Lord Krishna.' That's because Lord Krishna took an avatar. King Parikshit wanted to hear His story in detail. Because Lord Krishna took birth in the family of a cow grazer. He worked as a cow grazer. Getting inspired by Lord Krishna's story, he wanted to know about Him. - Meera. Because he was... - Meera, wake up. Lord Krishna will take birth... - Sister. Lord Krishna will be born in a low-income family, but will rule the world. He will protect the people from demons. When a devotee who always worships Lord Krishna, when he can impress sage Shuka, he can impress anyone in the world. Bhumidevi, not able to bear the weight of the earth, went and met Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma immediately took Bhumidevi and the other Gods and went to Lord Narayanan. Lord Narayanan told Lord Brahma, "Reduce the burden of the earth." "Very soon, I am going to take an avatar on earth." He also mentions the location. He says that he will take birth in Vasadev's house. Due to an increase in the atrocities of the demons, due to sins committed by them, and because they lead everyone on the wrong path, the Lord says that he will be born as Krishna. For the betterment of the people in this world, he takes this crucial decision. The elder son will be called Rama, that's how Balarama gets his name. Avatar means coming from one place to the other. God descends on earth from Vaikuntha. Why did He descend upon earth? To guide common people like us. Hence, he took an avatar. Because... - Meera forgot her card. He said, "To drive away the injustice from earth, I will take an avatar on the planet." Meera... Our respective families know that we're in love with each other. Yes. We'll get in trouble if we are caught meeting stealthily. You're right. Let's go. - Hello, sit down. No. We have been dating each other for a long time. My father has given his approval for our marriage, please wait. He said we should get married only if I settle down. Won't you settle down in life? Come on, Meera. I will settle down after graduating from college. Then clear your supplementary exams. Lord Krishna has a girlfriend in the neighbourhood. She doesn't talk to him for several days. He decides to talk to her. He comes to the shrine and waits for her eagerly. But during his absence, she attends school. When she peeped, Lord Krishna also peeped at the same time. He then waved at her. Lord Krishna asks his girlfriend, "Where have you been?" I will beat you! It's been days since I beat you, that's why you're doing this. If you return home without the dog, I won't spare you. Find the dog. Someone must have taken it away. You failed to look after a dog, you don't deserve to have one. Such a waste of money. They were after me to buy a dog. Initially, they were after it all the time and then they lost interest. Why are you here? You also played with him. Find the dog. I will trace the dog using my sixth sense. If I am right, that would be great. Mom! Mom, I found the dog! Where did you find it? I found it in the temple corridor. Do you want tea? Give me some. When I serve food to dad, I'll serve you as well. Mom. Mom. - Yes? My menstrual date was on the 3rd, it's 7th today, I still haven't got my periods. It's been delayed by four days. - Yes. That's not a problem, it happens when your body is weak. Look at you, you don't eat well. You go to college without having breakfast. I wonder if you even have lunch. You don't even have dinner properly. It's been delayed by four days? - Four days. Change the channel, let's see who is batting first. Wait, dad. Only for a little while. Please. Wait, dad. It's the central minister, he was here to meet the seer. Oh. Me? Me? He's calling you. I visit often, but he has not called me even once. Yes? Child, tell him your problem. I have to clear the supplementary exams at any cost. I'll be able to settle down only if I clear the supplementary exams. I am dating a girl. I'll be able to marry her, only if I settle down. With the grace of God, everything will fall into place for you, hereafter. Eat. My stomach is full. Hello. - Meera. Tell me. The seer spoke to me. - I see. He said everything will fall into place. When are you coming back? Tonight. Okay. We will meet tomorrow. Did you get your menses? Not yet. I am very powerful. I am the avatar of God. No one other than me knows about it. I'm telling you because you're my best friend. I found my missing dog using my powers. I won't use my power now, I'll use it for a greater purpose. I will use it for my benefit. I won't use it unnecessarily. Don't tell anyone about it. Okay. Sethu! Narayanan! Get up! Why are you talking in class? Sethu, this is the last warning for you. If you talk again, I'll throw you out of the classroom. Sit! Yes, mom? - I'm here to take the lunch box. Why didn't you have lunch? - I was not hungry. Are you unwell? I am just tired. Did you get your menses? No, mom. Meera... Why are you still asleep? Don't you have college today? I do. Did you get your menses? Don't go to college today. There shouldn't be so much of a delay. Let's meet our family doctor. Karnan. Duryodhana. Dharman. Arjunan. Bheeman. Nakulan. Sahadevan. Who's playing Draupadi? Draupadi... - Ma'am... Krishnan. Thank you. They are playing soldiers. You're God, not him. Let's rehearse. Ma'am.. Ma'am. - Yes? I want to pee. Make it fast. She's crazy. Sethu is the real God. You're right. He will be the right person to play Krishnan. He looks like Lord Krishna's avatar. Shall we tell her you're the real avatar? I have told you not to tell anyone about it, didn't I? Yes. I am the avatar of God. Promise me you won't tell anyone about it. I swear by God, I won't tell anyone about it. She's pregnant. No doctor, it can't be. - Shut up! Are you crazy? Dad had given his approval for your marriage. But, what the hell have you done? No, mom. - Shut up! Just shut up! - Look, such a matter becomes worse only because of parents like you who panic. Understand that first. She's not a school kid. She's in the final year of college. I will speak to your husband. Meera is weak. An abortion would stress her physically and mentally as well. I know people who haven't been able to have children after the first abortion. Mudra. - Uncle. Come here. It's a being. Ethically, I'd advice not to kill it. And one more thing. We won't understand it. The memory of the foetus would make her feel guilty forever. You said the boy's family is aware about them dating each other. I suggest you get them both married instead of going for an abortion. Sister! Hello. Who's this? - I am Meera's father speaking. Uncle. Tell me. Come home. I'll be there. Who was it? - I will tell you later. Increase the volume of the television. Hi. Hi, uncle. Gayu, go inside. She's pregnant. She's pregnant? Who's pregnant? My daughter is pregnant. Meera is pregnant. What? My daughter is pregnant. Meera? Give me your father's number. Uncle? Tell me your father's number. My father's number? 98... 98... 4... 402... Is it double 4? No, just 4. 8888. Uncle, Meera.. Okay. Is your father out of his mind? He says you're pregnant. Meera, he told me you're pregnant and took my father's number. Stop him. Otherwise, there will be a mess. Hey, why are you crying? Mom and I saw the doctor this morning. Is it? Regarding what? My menses have been delayed by six days. Does it mean you're pregnant? But the doctor said that I am pregnant. Is it? Did he examine you? He's not a good doctor, don't believe what he said. Initially, even I didn't believe him. I then did a strip test at home, even that showed positive. What's a strip test? One comes to know with that. How does one come to know with that? One comes to know with that. Why are you crying as if you're pregnant? All the tests are positive. How is it possible, Meera? I... Nothing happened between us. How is it possible? Don't get confused. The doctor and the test results are wrong. Don't worry. Let's consult a good doctor tomorrow itself. You're good for nothing. My daughter... Meera is very weak. The doctor said that abortion is a bad idea. He said she would face problems in the future. I don't want my daughter to suffer. She's a young girl. I'm sorry about what happened. Tell me, how should we go about this? The only option I see is marriage. Okay. Anyway, we were about to get them married. We should've done it after my son's graduation. But in today's day and age, it's not a problem, let's do it. But let's do it at the earliest, or else, it will bring us shame. Let's tell the people that the horoscope says, 'If not now, they won't be able to get married in the next ten years.' Don't worry. Let's fix the wedding date at the earliest. Thank you very much. It's okay. Give her the prescribed medicine. The test is positive. Don't try to abort the baby elsewhere. She's very weak, already. If something goes wrong, she'll suffer forever. Careful. Go home and inform your parents about it. Don't stress her. It's the matter of her life. You're smart when it comes to general things. You know where to meet, what to do and if something like this happens, whom to consult. But you don't realize the consequences of such things. You may go. Mister. - Sir. Is this medicine for me? No, sir. Sir, fees. The fees. Pay outside. Okay, sir. Yes, sir. - The fees. Rs. 300. Buy the medicine over there. He's with a patient, I will call you once he's done. Please wait. - Okay. Meera. Meera, don't cry. Why are you crying? Even this doctor told the same thing. Meera, give me one last chance, let's consult the best gynaecologist in Madras. Let's tell the doctor everything. Where is your phone? Where have you been? We had gone to see the sample of the wedding invitation card. Are you crazy? He has no common sense. What's the matter with you? You must not travel on the bike during pregnancy. Give her this folic acid tablet. You're pregnant. Your foetus is four weeks old. You will have a baby in the next 37 weeks. Doctor, is she pregnant? Why do you ask? Actually, we consulted two doctors, already. They also said that she's pregnant. All the doctors would say the same thing. Doctor, what I mean to say is, nothing... nothing happened... Nothing happened between the two of us, doctor. What? There has never been intercourse between the two of us. Then how did you become pregnant? I don't know, but nothing happened between the two of us. Then how did you get pregnant? You know. Maybe after the party in a pub... No doctor, we have never been to such a place. Maybe the two of you got drunk and... No doctor, we don't drink. Do you stay together? No doctor, we live in our respective houses. Then how can this happen? Mister. - Doctor. Could you wait for a few minutes? Okay, doctor. Are you kidding me? How could it be possible without your knowledge? I don't understand, doctor. What's your name? Come again. Meera. Meera, did you sleep with another man? Don't cry, Meera. Stop crying. Meera, it's a very serious issue. Try to remember. If you had a visitor home and without your knowledge... How is it possible, doctor? What are you trying to tell me? Are you still a virgin? Stop crying, Meera. Stop crying. Yes, doctor. Send the boy inside. - Okay, doctor. The two of you come to this multi-speciality hospital sharp at 11:30 tomorrow. Don't delay. See me there. Sir, come. Go inside. Are you her boyfriend? Fantastic! All right, you may go. We will run through the reports of the tests conducted. We will send for you after a couple of days. It's not for you, drink it. Why do you look stressed all the time? Me? I am fine. I see. Let's book a wedding hall. The wedding hall? Okay. Number of guests for the wedding reception? Well, we need to consult the groom's family. Around 300-400 people. 300-400 people... Yes. Welcome drink, sweets, steamed cake, fritters, porridge, fried pancake, different types of puddings, ice cream. It will be a grand feast. We also cater North Indian food. Food will be the highlight in your daughter's wedding. Eat. Our family doctor has prescribed medicines because I am pregnant. They will call us tomorrow, won't they? Yes, they will. Are you crazy? You're not supposed to carry any weight. When will they call us? I can't take it any more. We can expect a call from them by evening, have patience. Hello. I am calling from Chettinadu hospital. Come to the hospital in the evening. - Okay. You must be here by four. - Okay. Bring your parents along. Oh. Okay, I will. Okay. Okay. Hello, Meera. I just got a call from the hospital. What did they say? They have asked you to bring your parents along. What will I tell my parents? Meera, tell them the truth. It's the only option. It's mandatory. Okay. Dad? Mom... What's your name? Rangarajan. I am Ramachandran. Rangarajan, where do you work? At the agriculture department. Then it's easy. I'm sure you know about asexual reproduction. Yes, I do. Your daughter is just like the species you just saw. These species conceive on their own. Meaning, without the support of a male, the female has conceived on her own. It's just fantastic. It happens only with certain species. A year ago, in a zoo in America, a shark conceived on its own. Medically, we call it Parthenogenesis. Otherwise, we call it as a virgin birth. Or, baby without a father. Meaning, a female conceives on her own without the help of a male. A research is being conducted if the same thing can happen to humans as well. In the 1950s, a woman in England, conceived on her own and birthed a girl baby, that's what they said. But it was not proved medically. It has happened now. In the human race, your daughter is the first woman to conceive on her own. Meaning, a baby without a father. Doctor, why did it happen only to my daughter? It's not a disease. Actually, your daughter is very special. Whether you like it or not, the news will go to the medical council, the entire world will know of it. Your daughter is still a virgin. She's still a virgin. Sorry. Thanks. Hello. Sara, where are you? I have come out with mom. Tell me. I see. Why? Can you come home? Is it? I'll drop mom home. Shall I come in an hour? Okay. 'The minister met the seer today and returned to Delhi.' 'A woman in Chennai has conceived on her own.' 'A woman named Meera in Chennai has conceived on her own.' 'The doctors say it is Parthenogenesis.' 'Similar kind of incident took place abroad.' 'A female has conceived on her own.' 'The unborn is called,' 'baby without a father.' 'A woman in Chennai has conceived on her own.' 'The medical council said it is Parthenogenesis.' "Radio City." You are listening to Radio City, 91.1 FM. 'The entire city is talking about this since morning.' 'If such things can happen on its own,' 'what are men for?' 'Why should anyone talk about it?' I am Ganesh, welcome to the live debate. An incident has shocked the entire nation. A young woman named Meera from Chennai will be birthing a baby without a father. To talk about it, we have with us, Venkatachalam and reporter Aarti, Meenakshi Verma, and social activist Karthik. We will discuss this. Aarti, go. This is such a blessing. If this goes on continuously, we won't have to depend on men at all. Dependency will decrease. I think as time goes by, the male race will decrease. You are right. Suppose, by God's grace, if you experience the same thing, what if you give birth to a baby boy? No, this is a rare phenomenon. A very rare phenomenon. It's highly doubtful that such a thing will happen again. I don't think so. This is human evolution. Like humans evolved from monkeys. This is an evolution. Everything happens for good. 'This is a very big issue.' 'For God's sake, don't get confused by relating it to science.' 'Like doctors say, this is not the first child.' 'This has happened earlier.' '5000 years ago, in the Mahabharata,' 'how did Kunti give birth to Karna and Pandavas?' '2000 years ago, how did Mary give birth to Jesus?' 'Such children are not common.' 'They are God's children.' Then, Sethu. 'A child who is born without with a father, is an avatar.' 'Krita, Treta, and Dvapara era...' 'In every era an avatar will be born.' 'Similarly, in this bad era, an avatar will be born to guide us.' 'That avatar' 'has come into this girl's womb on its own.' 'The child that will be born is the avatar of God.' Should there be only one God in this world? There is Muruga, Vinayaka, Ayappa, Jesus, like Him, even you're a God, even that is a God. There may be many such Gods. What are you thinking? There are many Gods, but I don't know if they exist. That's what I was thinking. The jeweller had called. He says the nuptial chain is ready. Let's pick it up from there on an auspicious day. When should we start giving away invitations? I have to apply for leave in the office. What will you say when you distribute the invitations? Everyone in the city knows about it. They are flashing it on the TV and radio that the child is born without a father. Do you think the wedding is necessary? Mom, how is that issue connected to the wedding? Stay quiet. We can't do as you please. Your mom is right. We can't go ahead without knowing what is going on in Meera's house. We wanted to get them married soon, but that didn't happen. Everyone has learnt about it. Then why should we hurry for the wedding? Let them finish college and then get married. So, we came to talk to you. Sir... We wanted to know your opinion. Do you have any other idea? We haven't informed anyone yet or given away the invitations. We have just paid the advance money. That's not an issue. Moreover, we don't want to trouble Meera at this time. Sir, he is still young. He doesn't know anything. He blabbers nonsense. What does he say? Uncle, no matter who says what, it's our child, we have to support each other during this time. Moreover, we couldn't look after it. We have to be together. I don't want to be a father after the child is born, I need to be a father to it before it is born. I don't have any confusion. He is my son-in-law. I have decided to solemnize the wedding on the day we had fixed it. It's up to us. The wedding will take place according to the wish of the family. We were wrong that day. If he had said anything wrong, things would have gone haywire. Sir, we learnt a lot from him. He is the reason why we're living peacefully today. Sir, he has always been supportive of us. Let's support them. Why should we get confused and tensed? Sir, let's go ahead with what we had decided. You're right, sir. Let's not change anything. Let's go ahead with the wedding as we had decided. Finally, you became pregnant. Is it sir or ma'am? Get admitted one week before the delivery date. We live close by, do we have to get her admitted? Okay. Come here immediately if she experiences any discomfort. Not just you, this is the first time for us too. Sara... Sara, it hurts! Is it hurting too much? - Yes. Hello, I am Saravanan speaking. Meera's husband speaking. Meera is suffering from labour pain. Please come soon. I'll inform them. What is it? - Meera is suffering from labour pain. Lakshmi! Call the doctor. Uncle, I called. They are sending an ambulance. - Is it? Don't worry. Take care of the house, we're going to the hospital. - Okay. Take care. Get in. She gave birth to a baby girl. Move aside. Move back. Move back. Move aside. Move! 'Meera, who had become pregnant mysteriously,' 'gave birth to a baby girl today.' 'The family informed that the child and mother are fine.' 'People believe that this child is an avatar of this era.' 'People expressed their happiness by offering prayers and celebrated.' 'The Prime Minister, the chief minister' 'and the other ministers have conveyed their best wishes.' 'The time the child was born is not ordinary.' 'All the planets...' 'Seemed like the world was praying' 'for this special baby to be born.' 'As per the planetary positions, this baby is more favourable' 'than the similar kind of children born earlier.' 'Special and surprising news!' 'Nostradamus had written about this in his book.' 'He had predicted that' 'a virgin mother will give birth to a child' 'and that child will be born in a country' 'which is surrounded by three parts of the ocean.' 'He already predicted that the child would rule this world.' He could've been born anywhere in the world. Why did he take birth in your house? He could've been born as a male God, why did he take birth as a female God? Like Sita for Rama. Like Parvathi for Shiva. For Sethu... She's cute. Her smile is so beautiful. Sethu, why are you standing there? Come close and look at her. Mom... Say, 'Mom'. Say, 'Dad'. Darshini. - Dad. Get your child admitted to our school. We have a very advanced syllabus. - Excellent facilities. You need not pay the fees. You just get your child admitted in our school. "Radio City!" You have heard about Radio City 91.1. Many celebrities have come on our show. I can't address her as a celebrity as it will be an insult to God. God's child is on our show. We're going to talk to you on our show for the first time. Greetings. What is your name? My name is Darshini. Mom's name is Meera, and dad's name is Saravanan. Don't get confused. She is addressing her mother's husband as her dad. Excuse me. Ma'am? Don't say that. No one can become a father just by begetting a child. Saravanan is Darshini's father. I said it in a flow, I'm sorry. No problem. The child considers me as her father. I don't care about what others say. I'll let the God child touch it first. Sara. - Yes. Everyone is calling her God's child, do you feel the same? No. Sarvannan. Dad? There was a call from the monastery. Why, dad? I don't know. He asked to get the child's horoscope when you meet him. Horoscope? - Yes. He has called us, let's meet him. Okay, dad. Greetings, please come. You go, I'll join you. I'll be back. They are here. Get them inside. Please come. This is a divine horoscope. The Goddess had come in my dreams early in the morning. So, I asked you to meet me. She has reached where she had to. May her dwell here. People will take care of her. It is time for the prayers. Everyone will be waiting for us. Get the Goddess to the temple. What did the sage say? I didn't understand. How can I leave my child here? Why are you saying such things? This child was born for the betterment of this world. She should stay where she has to. No, I won't give my child to anyone. That child was not born as per your decision. Did you know you would give birth to such a divine child? How do you take it to be your child? If God wishes, He can choose anyone for this task. He has chosen you. That's it. Don't address her as God's child. She is a three-year-old girl. How can we leave her here? - Stay quiet. How are you related to her? I'm speaking to the mother. I can't give her away. She can't live without us. We take care of children as if they were Gods. If God is born as a child, wouldn't we take care of it? Listen, tell them to leave her here. It is time for the prayers, let's go. Let's go, mom. We won't leave her here. The priest is waiting. Stop. Where are you going? My child. She left long ago. You can leave now. Where is the child? Which child? My child. You took her inside a while ago. You worshipped her. She? She left with the priest long ago. Wait. You can't go there. Come. Stay here, I'll tell you. He is inside. You can't trouble him. The worship hours are over. You can't stay here. Please leave. How can we leave without our child? Please leave. Don't get angry. It is futile to do so. What about Darshini? I will go. Tell me. I want my child. She is inside. I want to see her. Outsiders are not allowed inside after dusk. Even the Goddess won't come out. At least allow the mother... Oh, my God! That's impossible. She shouldn't meet anyone. So, Goddess shouldn't meet her mother at all. Until we are here, we won't be able to do anything. We have to deal with it another way. Let's go to Chennai. We will have to deal with it legally. Sara, she would look for me. Meera, we will surely get Darshini. It won't be possible until we are here. Mom! How could they take the child without the permission of the parents? You don't wish to give the child to them, right? Then it is confirmed that the child should be with the parents. Don't worry. They took the child without the parents' permission so, our case is strong. They are influential people, so, the pressure will be more. We'll see. I'll try and get the hearing date as soon as possible. We can get back the child. Meera, I have taken an appointment with the minister. I will meet him. Shall we meet Dr. Ramachandran? He knows everything about Darshini and us. He will surely help us. I read it in the newspaper. I thought I'd meet you. Doctor, you have to tell them that Darshini is not God's child. Get her back to me. When it happens to other species, it's easy to deal with it. There won't be any problem. Belief in God and superstition are two different things. The problem began when it was considered as superstition. I don't know how much my words will matter, but I will do my best to help you. Doctor, what is her mistake? Mom... Mom... Come, sit here. Eat this. Look here. Sit here. Eat this. She is suffering from fever. I will prescribe some medicines. Somebody stay with her. Sara, I don't know how she is. I am scared. Will we get Darshini? Sure, Meera. People say she is God's child, I am scared they will make her one. Meera, don't worry. Nothing as such will happen. She is our child. We will surely get her home. Bring God's child here. God's child is refusing to come. God's child isn't in the mood to talk to anyone. I will call you some other day. It would've been nice had we taken blessings from God's child. Some other day, please. I'll call you. Okay, priest. We shall leave now. - Good day. - Okay. God's child is going here and there. It is difficult to find her. Shall we get her here after she's a little older? Yes, priest. Sir, it is not just you who has filed a case... Sir? Pontiffs of many temples have filed a case stating that the child belongs to them. One of them has asked me to take up this case. There are so many lawyers. How many cases would've been filed! Think about it. I don't think this case will end up quickly. Priest, the God's child is missing. Go, find her. She is not in her senses. There won't be any problem if she regains her senses within six hours. She has hurt her head. We have to perform scanning. First-aid has been administered. She has lost a lot of blood. We have performed a test to find out her blood group. Only after knowing her blood group, we have to inform the donors and the blood banks. Doctor, please don't let anyone know about it. Doctor, here is the blood report. Her blood group is A1B negative. It is a rare group. Inform the donors and the blood banks immediately. We need A1B blood. No one should know about it. - Okay, doctor. Where is she? There. Who are you? Why are you barging inside? Doctor, they are her parents. I saw the scan report. She's hit her head severely, so there's a blood clot in her brain. She's lost lots of blood. We have arranged for some, but we would need more blood for the operation. Her blood group is rare, so, it is difficult to get it. We have informed the donors and the blood banks. We will get it. - Doctor... Darshini and I share the same blood group. Sir, we'll keep you as a back-up. We'll need it later. Then we can ask you to donate. Now, we'll arrange it from elsewhere for the operation. 'The child which was born by a miracle,' 'pontiffs of several temples are claiming the child to be theirs,' 'the hearing of the case is in Chennai High Court tomorrow.' 'The parents say that their child' 'has been taken away from them forcibly' 'and the seers say that she is the avatar of Goddess.' 'The case will be heard in the court tomorrow.' Stay here. Sign here. God's child is battling for her life and the hearing of her case is today. God's child hasn't regained her senses yet. The parents of the child are shattered. It is surprising that the people who claimed the child to be theirs, haven't come to the court today. This child is God's child. Everyone says the child belongs to them. I would like to take a few names. Murugan, Dhanalakshmi, Peter, Mohammed Ali, and many other names. The above-mentioned names, these people donated their blood to the child when she was in need. They didn't know who they were donating their blood to. If you think about it, the names that I just called out, Murugan, Peter, and Mohammed. Now, people of three castes have donated their blood to her. Who does the child belong to? If you ask me, the one who comes forward to help someone in need, he is God. The child is God's child. Today, she is battling for life. If something happens to her, what will you do? We have become so selfish that we're ready to sacrifice a child. Forget considering the child as God, let's try and save that child. The one who took away the child without the parents' permission, this court condemns them. Moreover, the court orders an enquiry against them. I don't know if that child is God, she might be, but let her turn 18 years old and decide what she wants to be. That is good for the child. I pray to God that the child should survive. The child should stay with her parents. This is the verdict of the court. Mom... Dad... 'When the story began, there was someone who said he was an avatar.' 'Where is he now?' Sethu, did you hear the news? A child is born with '666' on the forehead in Kazakhstan. Satan is born, get to work. Did you finish your homework? - Yes. You finished it, didn't you? Go away. 'Being children, they understood,' 'but...'
