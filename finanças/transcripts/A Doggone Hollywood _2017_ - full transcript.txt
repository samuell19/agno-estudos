Subtitles by explosiveskull Doggy 911. A QN Production starring Murphy, the wonder dog, and Dirk Stevens with tonight's special guest star, Cynthia RothRock Tonight's episode, "A Bark in Time Saves Nine." You see anything, Murph? Yeah, I didn't think so. Nothing this side either. Sure hope we find them before they reach that incline down to Devil's Gorge. Well, what do ya say, guys? Did you have fun this weekend? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, only... Only what dear? Well, these brakes are getting kind of squishy for a new floor model. I didn't hear you complaining about them on the way up. Well, they were all right then, but now, we definitely have to get it checked out before we go much farther. I don't think we're going to find a mechanic up here. No, but I know for a fact there's a service station at the foot of Devil's Gorge. Home Base to Doggie 911. Home Base to Doggie 911. Come in please. Over. This is Doggie 911. Go ahead, Patty. Over. Matt, any sign of those campers yet? Nothing so far. What about Murphy? He's usually pretty good at honing in on people in trouble. Yeah, I know. We've both been looking, but nothing yet. That's not good. Murph better find them soon, before something real bad happens. You sure that park ranger's got his story straight? Well, according to Fish and Game, there was like four quarts of brake fluid spilled on the ground where those SUVs were parked last night. Yeah, probably hit a root, or a stump, or something. Either way, if they hit a downhill slope of any kind, they won't make it. They're done for. Yeah, I know. I get it. Hold up Patty, I think we got something. What is it Murph? You see something? Got him. Good going boy. Hey Patty, Murph found 'em. Oh, that's great. Where at? They're about four miles out from Devil's Gorge. Oh, you better go get 'em, they're not going to make it down that steep hill. I'm going to do just that. Signing off, doll. Over and out. Over and out. Looks like I'm going to have to put down in that clearing over there and run through the woods until we get to the road. You ready for that? I thought you'd say that. All right boy, let's do this. Come on Murph, we got about a minute to make it to that cut-off road. Let's go! There it is, Devil's Gorge. I see it. I see it. Shawn, look out! Murphy! - Hang on. Hang on. - Kids, hold on tight. Is anyone hurt? Kids, Sunny, you okay? Shaken, not stirred. - I'm all right dad. - Me too. Oh my goodness, think of what could have happened on that mountain. We're mighty lucky that you and your dog came along when you did. If you hadn't forced us to brake we might all be down at the bottom of that ravine. Yeah, thanks to Murphy here, everybody's okay. That's quite a dog you've got there mister. Tell me about it. Not another dog quite like Murph. Go on boy. Go on. Hi, Murphy. And, cut. Can I get a drink here please! Cynthia, that was beautiful, so sincere. Thanks J.W. If you need me I'll be in my trailer. Fine, all right, everybody, let's take five. I've gotta talk to the producers. What do you need makeup for at this hour? How did I do today Dirk? Great, better than that scene stealing mutt. I actually think he's kind of sweet. Oh, do you? He'd be a lot sweeter if he had second billing. Can't believe my agent still has me playing second fiddler to Mr. Mange over there. Dude, your jealous of a dog. Ha, ha, ha. Shut up. All right, get the dog back in the limo, okay? I don't want those Hollywood brats rough-housing with my star. Yes sir, right away. All right, and tell those lazy, good-for-nothing bodyguards to keep both eyes on our lead, all right? Yes sir. I didn't send a personal invitation to play cards! Listen, there's a couple lookieloos in the tree-line trying to get a look at our star, just shoo them away. Whatever you say Mr. Wagner.. Yes. What a jerk! Go fish. Again? Okay kids, give him up. Aw, can we play with him for just a little while? He's such a neat dog. And smart too. This is not a play dog, this is a money dog. And in Hollywood boys and girls, cash is king. - But... - But nothing. You wanna romp with a mutt, go to the pound. This dog needs to go back where he came from. Turn the air conditioning on high, and give him water whether he needs it or not. And when we wrap, take him back to the kennel and lock him up. Will do, sir. Kids! Kids! Get out of here! Get out of here, kids! Heck, dog, what are you crying about? You're a Hollywood star. You got it made. So, now we know where he is. How do we get down there to take a picture? Let's go down and just ask them. No way. Those movie people don't usually like kids anywhere near where they're shooting. Yeah, I heard that they were really mean. Well, we came this far, we gotta at least try. Ronnie's right, it'd be a shame to go home empty-handed. Your brother really wanted a picture of you and Murphy. Mm, you're right. I'm calling him right now, he'll know a way. Did you get it? Did you get it? Not yet, they put him in a limo and we can't even get close. Did you even ask? Peter, they were yelling at us from a half mile away. I don't think they're going to call us up and say, come on over kids, take all the selfies you want. Hold on, I got to check out that limo. How? Police drone system. You're kidding? Big brother finally comes in handy for a change. Okay, good. I got it. What's good? The limo is equipped with satellite Wi-Fi. I can hack it. What good will that do? You'll see little sis. Hey, does Kyle have his tablet? When's he ever without it? Okay, good. Tell him I'm sending one of my special apps. He'll know what to do. He's sending you something. He says you'll know what to do. Oh brother, here comes trouble. Relax guys, let me see what it is first. Hey guys, check this out. It's called, "Walking the Dog." Yo-Yo, we're here to see the real dog, not your dumb toy, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh! Candace, to what do I owe the pleasure? Look here Jim, these production reports tell me you're over a week-and-a-half behind schedule. That is totally unacceptable. I'm doing the best I can. You know the old Hollywood adage about dogs and kids? Well, I've got both of them. You're lucky you're getting anything good. That mutt is a terror on four paws. That mutt has the number one show on television. His face is on everything from sneakers to cereal boxes, not to mention our main sponsor, Alamo Pet Chow. So? So, with all that's riding on new episodes, we can't afford to slow down delivery. If we miss an air date, the network stands to lose millions. It would be like postponing the Super Bowl. I have a sneaking suspicion I know where this is going. I bet you do. From this day forward, Doggie 911 will shoot seven days a week until the time is made up. That is ridiculous. You cannot work people seven days a week, without a break. Same goes for the dog. We own the dog. He's our property. Shoot him 24/7 if you have to. What about the crew? They'll mutiny. Not if they're making golden time? What about the kids? There's no way around that. They can only be on the set eight hours a day. That's easy. Hire triplets and work 'em around the clock. You know, I've had it with you! Oh really? All your orders. Barking orders from Hollywood. There they go again. It's getting to be a weekly occurrence. Yeah, well, as long as it doesn't involve us they can scream all they want. Besides, it eats up production time. We wrap in 20 minutes. Should I check out our charge again? What for? He's in the limo with Leo. Murphy's not going anywhere except back to lock up. - Poor little guy. - Poor little guy? That poor little guys makes more in a day than we do in a month combined. I didn't mean it that way. I know you didn't, buddy. Go fish. And the download is complete. Took long enough. Hey, not bad for being out here in the middle of nowhere. So what is it anyway? Well, according to Peter, it let's me connect straight to the limo's computer through satellite Wi-Fi. And this helps us how? You'll see. Just be careful, Kyle. Okay? Watch closely. Sydney, guys, get your cellphones out. I think a photo op is about to happen. Okay guys, it's now or never, get ready to get your jpegs. I'm going to open the rear door. Here goes nothing. Hey, Kyle, you did it! You did it! There he is! He's right there. That dog is fast. He got out, let's get him! Wait Murphy, come back! Go Murphy, go! We should help. Not on your life. I hope he escapes and never comes back. Come here mutt. He's loose. Well, we got to get him back. That's our meal ticket out there. Well, now maybe with that dog out of the picture, I'll finally get top billing. Actually, with the dog gone they'll probably just cancel the whole show. They wouldn't do that. I can carry it alone. I know I can. Uh, Doggie 911, sweetie? The show is called, "Doggie 911." Oh yeah. Murphy! We better get out of here before they think we did it. But we did do it. Right, reason enough to be gone. Second that. Anyone get a good picture? I got a couple but they're all blurry. That doggie moves fast. Mine's great. Peter's going to love it. I wonder what happened to Murphy? Don't worry about it Isaac, I got away safe and sound. Huh? Who said that? Said what? Nothing. Come on. I'm back baby! Last time I looked at your contracts boys, you were supposed to be sole security for Murphy, not card sharks sitting around set playing canasta all day. - But... - But nothing! You had one job, and one job only, keep that dog safe and secure. You've done neither. But it wasn't our fault, somebody must have opened the car door and let him loose. Who? You were both seated less than five yards away. Who let him out? Tell me? Leo sure didn't. Pottman. I could have been Pottman, the dogs trainer, right? Pottman could have done it. I doubt that. He's to invested in the dog to do something so stupid. No, gentleman, as it stands Murphy disappeared on your watch and the agency, meaning me, is holding you both personally responsible. Should we call local shelters? If it were me I'd call my lawyers and accountants, because if you don't find that animal quickly QN Productions is gonna sue you for every penny you've got. Understand? We do Miss Smith. Good. Now get going. Find him. Yes, ma'am, will do. Go. Go. So, what do we do now, just close down? Of course not. Shoot around the dog until we get him back. Mm. And if somehow that doesn't happen? You remember Lassie, Jim? Yeah, sure. There were actually a dozen Lassies, one for each trick. I'm going back to Hollywood, and put out a call for a Jack Russell Terrier. If we can't have the original, we'll hire a double. I don't know, dog's pretty smart. You just leave it to me. My pleasure. Wow, that was so cool the way your brother's app opened the car door. Yeah, he's gotten real good at the computer ever since his accident. Ah, so it was these kids who helped me escape. I kinda figured it wasn't anybody on set. I just hope Murphy's all right. He sure took of running. He must not like the movie business very much. No, I didn't realize it showed. I just hope he's all right, he's so cute. That's me. This is taking forever. Walking home seems twice as far. My dad says that's called expectations. He gets the same way whenever he goes to the race track. He claims coming home is always long and tougher. Well, we could always take the short-cut. Oh no. This is going to be fun. The zip-line! No way! That's a death trap. It would get us home in record time. That is if we actually made it to the bottom. My mom says never even go near it. Come on, let's take a look anyways. Okay. All right. I don't know about this. Be careful guys. Don't worry. I'm good. This thing isn't the most structurally-stable building. This was closed down years ago. Do you think it's safe? Uh, uh, no way. I don't know. Half of me wants to try it out, but the other half says, definitely not. Listen to the other half, Ronnie. They closed this thing down for a good reason. Hey guys, check this out. What is it? Looks like a bunch of old helmets and stuff. You think it's worth anything? I don't know, might be able to get something for it online. Hardly worth the trouble. But at least we could actually make the jump safely. Come on, let's just walk it, we'll get home soon enough. Good idea Syd. Why risk it? You said it, Kyle. Why risk it? Why risk what? You just said, "Why risk it?" No I didn't. Okay. Okay. And away we go. Well, I kinda figured finding him here would be way too easy. Yeah, but it makes me sad to see all those other poor little dog caged up like that. Yeah, me too, Joe. But right now I'm interested in finding one dog, the dog that's going to save our jobs. You really think the studio's going to come after us for all that money if we don't find him? You bet they will. We'll be paying that debt off for 20 years or more. What about Leo the driver? Maybe it was him that let the mutt escape. - No, I don't think so. - How so? Well, when you were packing up I gave Leo's limo a thorough going over. Find anything? Uh-huh, the rear door on the driver's side was unlocked, and the window was completely rolled down. Mm. So? So, Leo loves his air conditioning much, he'd never let that happen. Then who? I think someone hacked the limo's computer from the outside, and helped that little fellow escape. Seriously? Hm-hm. And I have a pretty good idea, who too. PETA? No. - A rival network maybe? - No. So who? Do you remember those kids standing off to the side? No way, the oldest one couldn't have been more than 10. My seven-year-old niece knows more about hacking than the boys in DC. They certainly could have made that happen. Well, they're long gone by now, and the dog didn't follow them, it went the other way. Yeah, yeah, okay. I just have this hunch that if we find those kids, that's where we're going to find Murphy. Come on. You get their sent yet, Murph? Great, which way? Good, we got to find those sisters fast. We only have a few minutes left before this whole place is engulfed in a firestorm. Hey, did it start yet? Yeah, it's been on for 10 minutes. Where were ya? I was helping mom with the dishes. Want me to rewind it? Naa. You didn't miss much, just the forest fire show. Wait, but I've already seen that one. Aren't they supposed to have a new episode this week? That's what it said online, but it's just a rerun. Dang it! Help! Help! We're here ladies. No new episodes for a while kids, sorry. - What'd you say? - What'd you say? I said, no more new episodes, maybe, ever. Who said that? Yeah, is somebody here? Get ready, here we go. It's me guys! Murphy! Murphy! None other. In person. Star of stage, screen, and, uh, dog food commercials. What are you doing here? I got away from my keepers today, I believe thanks to you, your sister, and her friends there. Whoah, how'd you make it here? Easy-peasy. I just decided to tag along on the way home. But you're talking. Not talking, anyone can do that. I'm thinking, and I'm sending out the vibes so both you guys can hear me. But you never do that on TV. Believe me, I got enough problems. If they knew I could do this, I'd never get away from them. Do you mind? - Oh this is good. This is good. - Murphy. It's my favorite thing. Thanks for helping me get away. Get away? Get away from who? The people down at the agency. They run my show, book my commercials, and even plan my personal appearances. So you don't like being a star? Yeah, sounds like fun. To be perfectly honest, it's not. Even with all the la-la land perks, I'm missing the one thing every doggie, big or small, really needs. What? I'm soaking in it. You're doing it right now, Sydney, you too, Peter. A little affection goes a long way with us animals, especially ones like me who haven't had it in a long time. Wait, so you mean no one loves you down at studio? Believe me kids, that old Hollywood cliche is right on the money. It's lonely at the top! Oh, this guy. Oh God. Would you look at that. Every episode, Hercules here has an excuse to take of his shirt and show the six minute abs. Oh yeah, drink, drink. What a guy. So you don't like him? He's all right I guess, I just wish he'd flex those acting chops as much as he flexes those pecs. I've been carrying him for three seasons now! Wow, you never know sometimes. Pal, do I have stories... Oh, will you look at this. Look at this! I remember that shot like it was yesterday. I almost got my nose singed. You got that close to the fire? Believe me, still cleaning soot out of my ears. Oh brother, not this spot again. Oh, great special effects. Dog food in space. Alamo Pet Chow, because in space no one can hear you bark. Oh my gosh, no dog worth his salt would go near that stuff, it reeks! I thought you like Alamo. Buddy, that stuff tastes like it was made at the Alamo. Speaking of food, you guys wouldn't have any extra chow hanging around for a poor little dog like me, would you? I think we have some extra ham from dinner. Ham's good. Never turn down ham! Syd, he's hungry, go get him some food, and some water too. Wait, what do we tell mom if she asks? Tell her anything, just not about the dog, she'll make us return him. I do not want that. You're right, but we'll have to tell her at some point. I know, just not tonight, okay? Yeah, not tonight. Mum's the word, okay? Oh, and Murphy, I think there's some extra brussels sprouts too. Brussels sprouts! Now, if you don't mind Syd, I'll take a pass on that, they give me gas. Oh, okay. Be back in a second. You don't have to leave anytime soon do you Murph? Not tonight for sure. I'm feeling too much love around here to, you know, make a quick exit. Great. You can stay right here because I sleep in my wheelchair since the accident, so you can have my old bed if you want. Oh, I'd be much obliged Pete. Thanks so much. You know, I never say, obliged. Hang on gentlemen, I'll be right with you. So what you're telling me is there's no sign of the dog anywhere? No ma'am, but we have a pretty good idea of where he might be. Gentlemen, it's vital that you locate that animal, and soon. I've got a room full of dog food execs waiting in the screening room right now to watch the latest spot. I don't want to tell them, or the network, that their star is missing in action. Understand? Yes ma'am, but I just wanted to say... Tell me later, that's my daughter on the other line. Maitlin, is everything all right? Mama, I just heard on TV that Murphy is missing, it's not true is it? Why no, Honey. Of course we know where he is, just not exactly where. But the man on the news said he got away and no one can find him. I'm worried, Mama. Well, don't you be afraid, I've got people out looking for Murphy as we speak. We'll get him back safe and sound, and soon too. Is Calomay getting you ready for school? Yes, she's with me right here. Let me speak to her, okay? She wants to talk to you. Okay. Hi Mrs. Smith. Is it really on the news, I mean about the dog? Yes, on every channel. Darn, I was hoping we could keep this out of the press until we got him back. Well, the news is out there now I'm afraid. I know how much she loves that dog. So do my little ones. I mean the whole world loves him. So, play things down on the way to school, understand? Try to keep her mind off it. Okay. Well, I've got to run into an early meeting. Tell her not to worry, okay? I'll be home around 9:00. Okay, I'll see you then. She didn't want to say, goodbye? Oh no Honey, she's just really busy, but she did say not to worry. I'm sorry, I can't help it. I'm with you. Let's get you off to school. According to insiders, TV's most famous canine, Murphy the Wonder Dog, escaped from a movie set in canyon country yesterday, and up until now has eluded, both his trainer, security guards, and the public at large. A reward of $25,000, yes you heard right, has been offered for his safe return. We now return to our regularly scheduled program. Where is he? I don't know. When I woke up he was gone. Do you think he went outside to... You know? No, he's most likely afraid. Of what? Oh, because there's a big reward out if anyone finds him and brings him back to the studio. And if what he told us is even half true, I would never want to go back to that place. Whoah. Yeah, it's all over the TV, and the net. I just hope he's all right. Me too. Come on big brother, Mr. Kirkland will be here any minute now, and you know how he hates to be kept waiting. I'm so sick of home school. I wish I could go back to normal class with you and the gang. Well, why don't you? Because I can't. The doctor keeps telling mom that you have the power to get up and walk, so just do it. Believe me sis, I try every day, but my legs still feel numb like right after the accident. Well, let me help you. No. I got it. I got it. You really got this thing down. Yeah, you should see my motorized one. I can go zero to 60 in under 15 seconds. Let's keep it under the speed limit for now, okay? Okay, sis. So, how'd she sound? Well, better than yesterday, but still plenty angry. But we're still on the payroll, right? Yeah, well, for today buddy, but who knows what's going to happen tomorrow if Murphy doesn't turn up. Do you think we could somehow locate the dog today? We've got to find those kids, see what they know. That's not going to be easy. There are probably three or four schools in the area with kids that age, and who knows if they'll come forward. We have to start somewhere. So how are we going to recognize them? They were too far away from set to ID. I have an idea. One of those kids was doing yo-yo tricks. There are millions of kids with yo-yos. Not anymore, you're living in the past buddy. Today's all cellphones and tablets. No, no, yo-yos went out with hula hoops and 8-tracks. Eight tracks? What are eight tracks? You know the, eight... This seems like a job for Sherlock Holmes. Personally I think we need James Bond. Hurry Murph, it's gaining. I know, I know, but we can't let them uncover the secret. Ah. You've got to do something, Murph, the secret is too important. You did it Murph, you did it. Now the secret is safe. That is, the secret formula the folks at Alamo use to make every can of their meaty Pet Chow, fit for the super dog in your life. Right Murph? Well, gentlemen, what do you think, it's a winner all right. I believe my staff put together quite a spot for you. Overall it's what we talked about and agreed to, yes, but I'm a little worried about it being so close to James Bond. I don't want the people in England to give us any trouble. As I recall Milt, it was your idea to do a James Bond style commercial in the first place. Maybe so, but, but I'm concerned. Sir, you need to take a look at this. I just got this text from my wife. What is it? Just read it, sir. Can it wait? No sir, it can't. It says that Murphy the dog was missing since this morning, the whole world is looking for him, and there's a big reward on his head. Is this true Candy? Well, he did get away from us yesterday on set, but I have people out now combing the area, looking to track him down quickly. We'll find him. This is no good. I know, sir. If that dog is missing permanently the show goes down and Alamo might as well go with it. With all our fan mail we could lose our core audience. I can see the reaction already, if they can't keep track of their mascot, how can they make a decent dog food? Candy, my apologies, we'll discuss this ad when and if they dog is found. In the meantime, kill all the spots this week and next week. We don't want the public thinking that Alamo is insensitive to the loss of a dog. Yes sir, I'll keep you informed of our progress. You do that. Gentlemen, let's head back. And the name is Candace. Okay you two, let's get this show on the road, you're going to be late for school again. I won't, I'm already in class with Mr. Kirkland. That's right, bud. Why don't we get to the table, and get started. Math first? You got it. Okay, sir. Oh my gosh, I almost forgot... Later, sis! Later, bro! Let me know if you run into anyone special, okay? Oh, I will. What was that all about? You guys planning something? Yeah, it's a little brother sister secret. Ah, I got you. I used to do the same thing with my little sister when I was your age. You did? Yeah, I did. You know, contrary to popular belief, I too was once a young person, like yourself. Really? Yeah, really. Syd, here are the cookies I made last night for the bake sale at school, and don't you and your friends go eating all of them before you even get to class, okay? Yes, mom. And here's $5 so you can buy something for tonight's desert. Yes, mom. Any kind of cake or pie is all right, as long as it's not mince or rhubarb. Yes, mom. Okay, off with you now. - Bye, mom. - I'll see you after school. Michael, Peter, can I get either of you a little toast or coffee? - We're good. - No, I'm fine, thanks. Good, maybe I can relax a bit and catch up on the morning news. There's only one thing on the news this morning. Really? What? That missing dog from Hollywood. He got lost around these parts yesterday afternoon. You know, I heard on the radio this morning, they upped the reward to $50,000. You don't say, we could really use that cash. I don't believe it. Neither do I. Come on Syd, quick faking us out. It's true I tell you. He jumped through Peter's bedroom window last night and just started talking. Do you mean like opening his mouth and actually speaking? No, more like we heard his voice in our heads. Oh, like telepathy. Yeah, like that. I saw aliens on TV do that once, but they were from another planet. Do you think Murphy's some sort of dog from outer space? Heck, I'm no alien, I'm from right here on earth, born and bred. Did you guys hear that? I think I did. I don't know. Hey, Murph, is that you? You bet it is, actor, writer... But what I really want to do is direct. Wow, it's really him! I must be dreaming. Hey, Murph. Hey Syd. Hey everybody. My gosh, Syd, you were telling the truth. What'd you think? But he can actually talk? I don't believe it. Believe it Isaac. Believe it, I've been talking for years. So how come you don't talk when you're on TV shows? Well, for one thing the scripts stink, they're not very good, and for another, a talking dog might draw some unnecessary attention from the government. They'd immediately want to know what makes me so special. So what does make you special? Yeah, how's it that you can talk? Well, how about you give me a couple of those cookies you got there and we'll chat on the way to school. Yeah, we'll be late if we don't hustle. Here you go, Murph. Wow, freshly baked. Nice! I never get cookies at the kennel. The kennel? I saw on Celebrity Insider that you lived in a big house in Hollywood. Big house? My trainer lives in a big house in Hollywood Isaac. Every night after work he locks in a private little kennel in the backyard until the next morning. Wow, that sounds awful, doesn't he ever play with you? Nah, the only time he ever even speaks to me is when he wants to teach me a new trick. Gee, that stinks. It kind of does, Ron. Can I call you Ron? That whole la-la land bit get's really old, really fast let me tell you. So that's why you took of when you did. Exactly. You kids gave me an opportunity and I took it! So you knew it was that freed you? Kyle my boy, I'm not just a pretty face, I got brains I haven't even used yet. No, see, somebody hacked the Wi-Fi in the limo to make that lock and door bit happen. I just figured it was you four. Guilty as charged, but now knowing how they treated you, I'm kind of glad I did it. You're not the only one, guy. I'm mighty grateful to you all. Now, come on, let's get you guys to class before they make you, I don't know, sit in a corner? Do they still do that, by the way? Hardly ever. You see, I've been locked away so long I've been... I've been behind the times. Here we go. Then he just said, kill all the commercials for at least two weeks. So we've got a missing dog, and a missing dog means I've got a problem. And when I've got a problem I start to think about how everyone is replaceable, so... I have men out there looking for him now, but so far nothing. And the TV show? The director is shooting everything he can that doesn't include the animal. But Smith, that's a short solution to a tall problem. What we need to look for is the worst case scenario. And that is? That the dog is gone and we won't get him back. And if we don't get him back the show won't go on. And if the show doesn't go on it will curtail certain life sustaining revenue streams. And we could lose millions. And we could lose millions, but not, N-O-T, not if we can find a quick replacement. Sir? Look, Candice, the one thing I've learned in my decades in the big time, surviving in dog eat dog Hollywood, is that nothing, no one, is irreplaceable. You, him, them, these, those, nobody. I don't know, that dog is loved by millions. There have been at least 10 guys playing James Bond over the years, not to mention Batman, Superman, and X-men. Put out a call, get some new dogs in here this afternoon. This is Hollywood, we should be able to find a couple hundred canines anxious to be the next Murphy the Wonder Dog. Just get on it. But we can't just... No buts, just do it. I'll clear my schedule between 1:00 and 3:00. I'm sure we can see the best dogs Tinseltown has to offer in under two hours. I guarantee you we'll find the next Murphy by the end of the day. Yes, sir, I'll get right on it. I'm counting on you. The kids of the world are counting on you. I'll bring the Alamo. Funny. Very funny. So Murphy, you still haven't told us how you got the power to talk. Oh, you don't want to hear that old story, it's boring. No, come on, tell us, we all want to know. I do at least. Yeah, Murph, spill it. Okay, okay, you guys like cartoons? I guess so. Well then, I, I, I... Here's a flashback for you, short, sweet, and right to the point. I was a loner, no family, friends, just running around the countryside picking up scraps wherever I could. And one day I hopped a train to Hollywood. I'm thinking fun in the sun, right? Only thing, it's raining when I get there. What's that about? So I'm thinking, maybe Vegas, but just then lightning strikes me on the head. Twenty-four hours later, I wake up in an animal shelter and I'm suddenly hearing what everybody's thinking, and understanding it as well. So what happened next? Well, some guy from Universal comes in looking to pick up dog extras for "Beethoven 18." I never saw that one. Nobody did, old Beethoven's contract was up, you see, and like most movie dogs he was tired and just wanted out. I should have listened to that lovable St. Bernard. But no, being a young, impulsive pup I made a fool out of myself doing all these wild tricks for the trainer on set. Then what? Well, next think you know, I'm doing a pilot for Doggie 911, and the rest as they say, is television history. I got the number one show on the tube, and I hate every minute of it! That's why I just had to get away. You can stay with us if you want. There's plenty of room, and you'd be perfect company for my brother. You know, he's housebound ever since his accident. I really appreciate your kindness Syd, I really do, but you know, there's a big reward out there for anyone who finds me, and you wouldn't want Peter or your mom to get accused of dog-napping. So where will you go? I'm not sure about that Isaac. I'm thinking either Okinawa or the Belgian Congo. Never been there. Neither has anyone else, I suspect. Will you be after school at least? Sure, I'll wait for ya, can't leave without saying goodbye, right? I'm right, right? Am I right? Okay then, I'll see you when class lets out at 3:00. Righty-o! So long for now kids. Oh, hey, kiddo, you wouldn't happen to have another cookie, would ya? Huh, I'm begging. Look, I'm begging. Make it last until end of school, okay? Most certainly. Oh, yellow, I love yellow. Man, have I been missing this? Later, Murph. Oh, hey, wait a minute... Oh, hang on a second, I buried a bone back here. Yeah, I got to get the bone, it's by the tree by the lake. Tree by the lake. Bone by the tree by the lake. Yeah, hello, Principal Callahan's office. May I help you? It's Maurice in maintenance. I gotta talk to him. I'm sorry, you'll have to call back. He's on the other line, and he's got two Hollywood people waiting. All right. Yeah, well, you gotta ask yourself one question son. What? Do you feel lucky? I don't know. Well, do you punk? Please let me do it over. Please. All right then, come back Monday. You can take the test over. Let me see if I've got this straight. You two gentlemen are missing a dog, and you think one or more of my student's may have stolen it? Is that about right? Yeah. But you don't have a shred of evidence. You're not sure which kids, because you weren't close enough to make a positive ID. Yet, the only thing that you remember positively is that one of the kids may have had a yo-yo? I'd stake my career on it. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah. And now you want me to give you free run of the school so you can track down this alleged kid with a yo-yo? We'd appreciate that, yeah. Yeah, if you don't mind, sir. Yeah, well, as a matter of fact I do mind, strenuously. You dudes get lost, hear now? But... Drop it! The only yo-yos around here are you two, and you're not giving any of my kids the third degree, not without a court order, and over my dead body. Understand? We get it, sir. I hope you do, both of you. Bye, Mr. Callahan. Yeah, we'll, uh, be... Yeah. That went well. Yeah. Man's got to know his limitations. Yeah, kid. Hi, sir, I have your brother Harry from Frisco on line two. Tell him I'll call him back. Yes, sir. - Hello inspector? - Yeah. Yes, um, he'll have to call you back. So what do we do now? Go get the car, park it around the corner out of sight. We're going to wait until school lets out and then we're going to keep our eyes peeled for a yo-yo. Sounds good. We're going to get those punks. Okay. Bone by the tree, by the lake. By the tree, by the... Where's the lake, is it over... Huh, wonder what the heck that guy's up to. Tree by the lake, it's got to be over here. I don't remember the picnic table. Well howdy, pup. And where did you come from on such a fine morning? I'm just hanging around enjoying the day I guess. I'm trying to do the same thing. You got family around here? Wish I did. Nope. I'm kinda, you know, on my own. You and me both, little fella. You and me both. Jonathan. Jonathan Buchanan at your service, laddie. Nice to meet you Jonathan, they call me Murphy. Must be kind of hard, you know, playing checkers there all by yourself. That it is. That it is. Do you mind? No, help yourself. Well now, despite you being a talking dog and all, that certainly does call for a response. Mm, Jonathan, I can see by your maneuvering you're fairly astute at this game. Well, I ought to be, been playing for years. Alone, like this? No silly. Always played checkers every day with my friend, Tommy McGee. Tommy didn't make it here today I guess? No, afraid he won't be coming along. I get it. Sorry. Oh, don't be. Now that I'm conversing with a checker playing dog I guess it won't be long before I'm following in his footsteps. Hey, you shouldn't talk like that, you're a human, you still have time left. Us dogs, we only have 15 years or so to pack a lifetime into, and let me tell you something, it ain't easy. Well, you certainly have some food for though there, Murphy. I'll be gnawing on what you said. It makes a lot of sense. It sure does. There, now, king me! Well, looks like you're winnin' at this game. How about two out of three. Sure, what time is it? I've got five 'till one. Great, I'm good 'till 3:00. Ready? Let's play. Quite a surprise, hey Smith? I told you this is Hollywood, and trained mutts are a dime a dozen. I did the best I could on short notice, emailed or called every dog agent in the book. - Called Doggone Good? - Yup - Doggie Do. - Uh-huh. Diggie-Dog? Of course, at the top of the list, but there's at least 50 in Hollywood alone. - I told you. - You told me. I told you that I told you? You did. - I did tell you. - I know. and I'm still waiting on a call back from Benji's people. Who's he represented by? Bicker, Greedy, and Rich? William Morris. Oh, big time big shots. They don't return calls. So, who's up first? That would be Roley-Poley. Funny, good name for a dog. That's the owner's name, Boss. The dog is Mr. Jakes. Jakes, well, okay, well, bring them both in. Let's get this show on the road. Marie, we're ready. Lie down. Play dead. Stay. Can we use this dog, because this is a smart dog? Lucky, sit. Good boy. Up. Come on Willie, speak. Barry Manilow has a beagle, a lot of people have beagles. Come on puppy, speak. Paw. - No, Ninny. - This way. Ninny. -This way. Stay this way. Move. Speak, Willie. Spikey, roll over baby. Come on, roll over. No. Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro. Say it. Figaro, Figaro, come on, do it, do it. Go get it. Okay. Lookie up, lookie down. Lookie up, lookie down. Hello, this is my dog Teddie, isn't she sweet? Yes, she's so sweet. She's always there when I wake up in the morning, isn't that great? Well you know, she can dance, she can roll over, she can sing... Oh, did anybody bring a piano? I wish I was a pair of claws scuttling across the flause of silent seas. Thank you. Now wag your tail, Abby. I think we've got our dog. Look, she's pointing. Beautiful, Sophie. Let's try, speak, Abby. No? I think she'll do well with this. I think she's going to be... She was the smartest circus dog, and everybody in the circus loves Sophie. Thank you so much for brining, Howdy into see us. I, I'm sorry, I think Howdy's just a little nervous today. Yeah, it's okay, I understand. I have those days myself, all the time actually. We will let you know. Thank you. Thank you from the both of us. Come on. Help. Boy, I can't tell you how nice it is to finally say goodbye to Howdy. So, who do you like? More like, who didn't I hate? There was some cute ones. Oh, Candace please, they were dumb as a brick, round as bowling ball. Some cute ones, but no one, no one holds a candle to Murphy. So what do we do? Not we, you. I want you to get down to the area that Murphy got loose and set up a command post. I'm putting you in charge of getting that dog back. You understand? But Quinn, I can't just go off for who-knows-how-long and leave Maitlin high and dry. Okay, fine. Bring her along. I couldn't do that. Why not? Next week is spring break. I'm sure she'd like a little mini-vacation with mama. It'll give you some bonding time. Well, maybe. You see anything? Not so far. Only glad my childhood didn't consist solely of texting on a cellphone. It's a whole new generation out there, Joe. It's not like when we grew up. These kids don't know what they're missing. Nobody talks anymore. At least the kid with the yo-yos keeping it real. You may have something there, pal. What about you, anything? No, I'm just getting hungry watching all those kids scarf down those deserts. No yo-yo? No yo-yo yet. Hey guys, how was school? Don't answer that. But check this out, it's called "Rocking the cradle." You're walking my last nerve, Ron. It's a good thing Principal Callahan didn't catch you with that in-between classes. Yeah, he would've grabbed it for sure. I was careful. He almost took my iPad in the library once, but I told him it I was using it to look up a history question. Yeah, what were you really doing? Playing "Space Duel." Did you get anything good at the bake sale? Sure did. A dozen cream-filled cupcakes. You? Four blueberry pies. My dad loves them. I got you both beat. How big guy? A double lemon merengue special. I got a bunch of Miss Miller's chocolate eclairs for Peter. He loved them last year. So where's Murphy? You don't think he took off or anything? No, he promised to stick around. Someone could have grabbed him, like the dog catcher or the police. Oh, I hope not. Hey, do I smell chocolate or something? Murphy! We thought someone might have recognized you. Don't you worry about me, I'm the master of disguise. Look what I found on the playground. Make me look smart? Nope, not making it. Sorry, Murph, not cutting it. That's funny, it worked for Clark Kent. Mm, I was thinking... Oh, something on my nose. Oh, there go my glasses. Joe, check it out, yo-yo 2 o'clock. Bingo, we got 'em, those pesky kids and the pooch. Let's get the little guy and go home. Not so fast, buddy. We set foot on school property that principle will have the police down around our necks before we know it. What do we do? Let's pull around the back, find a side road and wait. Those kids will walk right into our hands. We won't have to do a thing. Good idea. So Murph, what'd you do all day? Nothing much, caught some rays, played a few games of checkers. Sounds fun. I'll tell you, it's a dog's life, kiddo. A dog's life! Hey, look over there. I think they're following us. Yeah, they've been behind us for a few minutes now. It's probably nothing. Sorry to inform you, Ron, but it's something, something bad. I recognize that car. Those are the two security guys assigned to bring me back. If I didn't know better I'd say those kids just made us. What do we do? Well, we just pretend everything's okay, la, la, la. But get ready to run when I tell ya, maybe we can get away from them if we run fast enough. We can never outrun adults. Especially carrying all these cupcakes, pies, and stuff. Wait, I have an idea. What? If they bolt get ready to run. This car suspension won't make it over that rough terrain. Ready when you are, buddy. The zip-line, it's just right up ahead. We can make a run for it, get on, and maybe escape. Sounds good. The helmets are over there waiting for us. Well, I'm game. Me too, I guess. What about you Murph? Mm, that zip-line looks scary. You're an action star, right? So they tell meeee, yeah! Then you're going to love it. Ready guys? - Let's do it. - And let's do it now. That car is getting closer. Hey, on my count, 3, 2, 1, go! We're out of here. Looks like you were right. Let's get 'em! Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, wait for me! There! Come on guys, we're almost there. Shortcut! Oh my gosh, it's the lake! Guy, not too fast Talk about a bridge over troubled water. Come on guys, be careful. Hey, this is me hesitating. Come on, Murphy! Come one! I can do it. I can't do it. I can do it. I can't do it. I can do it. Come on, Murphy. Come on! Oh, come on, let's do it! This is a little bit... Here, hold this. What do you think? What do you think? That was good right? Anybody got a parachute? All right, who's first? Yeah, which one of you guys is first? Okay. Okay, let me be the first to say, we should reconsider this. Come on. Sit down. Think about it. Maybe have a cookie? We don't have time, and besides, those guys will be here any minute now. Anyone? Fine, I'll go first, but Murphy, you're coming with me. You know, Syd, after due consideration maybe I'll just sit this one out. Sorry, Murph, we are out of here. - Bonsai! - Alamo! Come on! It's fun! If she can do it, then we can do it! Hey, they're coming! I'm going. So am I. Hey, wait for me. Geronimo. Hey! Help! Why me?! This is crazy! They're coming! This is so cool! Woo! This is one nutty ride! Keep going! Keep going! So this is what trees look like from the top... What now? I guess follow 'em? Uh, I don't know about this, Fred. Well don't think about it. Come on, we got to catch that dog. I, I, I suppose. All right. Don't think about it, just do it. We got to catch that dog. I, I suppose. Keep calm, buddy. I'll be right behind you. All right Mr. Murphy, you better watch out because here I come! Whoah! Ahhhh. Please not again. Please! Please! Whoah! Whoah! Out of the way! I should have got life insurance. Oh, at least there's a light at the end of this tunnel. Th ere she is! Light! Does this thing have any brakes? I don't think so. Too bad, gravity stinks! Is this ever going to end? Watch this! You cut that out, you kids! You just stop that! Ah, I'm going to get you kids! What? No! No! No. No, don't do it! No! No! No! No! Not the blueberry! No! Get the nest! Get the nest! No! No! It's in my nose! All right, get ready! Well, that was fun, can we do it again? Not now, we got to stop those men from getting you! How do we do that? They're right behind us. Watch this! Syd, what you doing? Help me with this! No! No! No! No! No, no, that can't happen! They're coming! This is a test with water! Pull. It's going! Can I help? Yes! Woo. They won't get ya now Murphy! At least not today. Come on, let's get out of here before they get up on shore. Can't wait to tell Peter about this one. Race you home! Are you okay? Do I look okay? This is... I'm sorry, was, my best suit. And now my face is on fire from all those hornet stings. I'm right there with you, buddy. Those kids really got the best of us. They're long gone by now. We're never going to catch them or the dog. Maybe not, or maybe... Got something? Save for Sydney Harris, 116 Hacienda Way. Perfect! We'll pay her a little visit first thing in the morning. Oh, my cheek. Oh, the other cheek. All right, I think that's about enough for today, why don't we pick it up again Monday. Thank Mr. Kirkland. Absolutely. You know, it's a real pleasure for me to teach somebody like you with such an open mind, it really is. All right, why don't I help you into your room. No, I got it. All right. You're getting pretty good with that rig. Yeah, you should see my motorized one. I can go 0 to 60 in under 15 second. Really? Wow! Well, you better keep it under 25 in the house, you don't want to put any holes in these walls, right? Yeah. See ya. All right, see ya Monday. How's he doing? Academically, great. No, I mean... I know. I know. I've tried to broach the subject with him a couple different times. He just keeps saying the same thing. He can't do it. Hey, wait a minute here. Can't, or won't? Honestly, I don't know. His physical therapist says there's nothing radically wrong with his legs, maybe just weakness since the accident. Poor kid. they think more than likely it's guilt keeping him confined to that chair. Guilt? I don't understand. Guilt for not being able to save his father right after the accident. Peter was thrown free, John unfortunately wasn't. It's been three years now and he still hasn't been able to bounce back. Well, I hope he does soon, because if he doesn't his legs are going to start to atrophy. I pray you're right Michael. To be honest with you, my late husband's accident insurance policy will be running out shortly. Without money coming in we won't be able to afford doctor visits, or even you for that matter. Oh, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no. Look, I've grown too close to Pete and to you to ever let money get in the way of what I'm trying to do here, so as far as I'm concerned, you don't have to worry about me, okay? Michael, I just want him to be well again. I got to do something about this. How much longer, Mama? Oh, about an hour or so. It's nice around here, reminds me of when you and Dad used to take vacations when I was little. Once upon a time. Is this where they film the show? Most episodes. The network loves the look. Maybe that's why Murphy ran away. If I were a dog, I'd love living here. It's so open and peaceful. Murphy lives in Hollywood, Honey. He's treated very well there, he's got the best of everything. Does he live in a big house like we do? A big private kennel, actually, almost as big as grandma's house in Maine. Is there someone there who really loves him? Well, there are people there who help him with whatever he needs. I guess that's okay, but not really if there's no one there who truly cares. Do you care, Mama? Mama, I asked if you care, about Murphy I mean. Of course I do, Honey. Of course I do. Not just because of your job, right? Yes? Ma'am, we have a possible address on the missing dog. Call the police, go to it, do your job. Yeah, well, ma'am, it's not that easy. You see, we have reason to believe that the dog is in the hands of some kids. So? Well, so it's getting dark soon. If we go out there loaded for bear, half a dozen black and whites, those kids will take that dog so deep into the woods we may never get him back. Then what do you suggest? Wait until morning. Joe and I will drive out there real friendly like, pay them a visit. It's Saturday morning and they won't be expecting us, the parents and the kids will be home, we'll certainly get that dog back in good order. Okay. Where are you staying? Where at the Horsey Manor Motel off the 14 near Fairvale. Go book a room for my daughter and myself, we'll be there in less than a half. Will do, ma'am. She coming here? With her kid! Oh, perfect! What was I supposed to do? I'll go book them a room. One far away from ours, if you don't mind. Yeah, will do. Can I come with you tomorrow, Mama? Without a babysitter I guess I have no choice, but why so much interest in Murphy? - I want to see who he picked. - Picked? I don't understand. I read in the book once, that dogs choose their owners, not the other way around. And since Murphy really had no one who loved him he must have chosen someone after he got away. I'd like to see who. Let's hope we get the chance. I can't believe we got away. Yeah, that zip-line seemed a bit dangerous. Dangerous? That's like calling the ocean a bit moist. So now what? Well, we got to find a place to hide Murph. Oh no, kiddo. As much as I'd love to stick around I'm going to have to move on. - No. - But we don't want you to. Look, guys, you've done a lot for me already and I really appreciate it, but these studio people are playing hardball now and I can't risk either of you getting hurt. But... No buts, we got to say our goodbyes now, because tomorrow morning first thing I'm packing my stuff and hitting the road. But you don't have any stuff. Even better. Look, there's got to be another way. Yeah, really. I have an idea. I do too. Mom. But it would mean telling her about Murphy. Hey, we should have told her already. You're right, hopefully. Murph, can you stay here for a sec? Sure, you guys go ahead, just leave the TV on. There's a Scooby-Doo marathon on the retro channel. Okay, but just don't move, okay? I won't. Promise? Hey, I'm a dog, we don't lie, unless we're laying around. Get it? You also don't talk. Well, we'll see you in a bit Murph. I love these kids. Hey mom, how's it going? Yeah, what you doing? Oh, kiddos, to be quite honest with you, I'm figuring who I have to pay now and who I can stall for a couple of weeks. Is our money really that low? Mm, let's just say it's a bit tight. I'm sorry, you can have the money from my piggy bank if you want. Mine too. I love you guys for offering, but it hasn't come to that quite yet. Now, what brings both you out here at once? Something must be up. They shut the cable off again? No, that's fine. We just wanted to ask you a question. I'm honored. What can I do for you? You know that dog who went missing and is also on TV? Yeah, Murphy? He's in all the headlines. Yeah, well, he's, um, he's also in my bedroom. What? You're joking. We're not. You didn't dog-nap him did you? Not exactly, he just kind of followed me home from the set a couple days ago. Well, Syd, we have to return him to his rightful owners immediately. Everyone's looking for him. But his rightful owners don't love him. Yeah, they treat him awful. They keep him locked up in a cage, don't play with him, and the worst of all they don't even pet him. And just how do you know all of this. He told us. He told you? Yeah, he talks. Yeah, really, truly. You mean like this? No, no, like this! This is a game changer am I right? Yeah mom, like that. Oh, I, uh, I hope I didn't interrupt anything important, and if I did, I'm sorry. A, a talking dog. A thinking dog. Even better. My goodness, I could see how you kids could easily fall in love, he's adorable. Thanks, Gwen. Next to loyalty, adorableness is one of my finest qualities. Look at this. So mom, we still have that question. What's that honey? - What do we do? - Can we keep him? Oh, as much as I'd like to, I'm afraid not Syd, he just doesn't belong to us. Somehow I knew this was going to happen. Darn it! Now, you close your eyes and get some sleep. You've had a really long day. Okay, Mama. Tomorrow we'll see if we can get Murphy back, okay? Okay. Good night. This is Smith. Yeah, hi, this is Sheriff Evans over at the Sherriff's Office. Two of your men dropped by yesterday and alerted me to your missing dog problem. That's right. Well, this is the contact number they gave me, and I think I've got good news. Yes? Yeah, I got a call from a woman over Hacienda Ridge name of Gwen Harris. Go on. Well, her kids found your dog and they want to return it. That's wonderful Sherriff. If you want to go over there tonight I can send a black and white to guide you in. When the sun goes down it gets dark pretty fast and you can miss one of those signs. On second thought Sherriff, I think this can wait until tomorrow. Well, I think that's a wise decision. And I'll tell you what, right around 9 o'clock I'll come over and escort you over there myself. And maybe I'll get a selfie with him? Who? Murphy, of course. Surely, that would be fine. See you then. Do you care mama? Do you care? Do you care? This isn't fair, we're just giving him back to the people who want to exploit him for money. It's true. I'll second that. You got a second? Kids, we discussed this a dozen times last night before I called the Sherriff. Hiding Murphy here is just plain wrong, and what have I always taught you? To do the right thing, no matter what. Correct. Yeah, but how do we know if we're doing the right thing? Well, whatever you do, please don't tell them I can talk. Please, I'm begging you. Don't worry Murph, your secret is safe with us, right kids? We don't want to come off like nut-jobs. Yeah, I'm not saying anything. Me neither. Thanks a million guys. I've got enough problems as it is, ticks, and fleas, you know... It's them. Hey Pete, you're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you? Sh, quiet Murph. That's what I thought. Stay here guys. Uh-oh. Miss Harris? Oh, it's Gwen, welcome. I'm Candace Smith. My daughter Maitlin. Our security team Fred and Joe, and of course you know Sherrif Evans. Miss Harris, ma'am. Sherrif. Oh, please come in. This is my daughter Sydney. Hello. Ah, the one who found Murphy. Congratulations, you've got quite a reward coming to you, sweetheart. And my son Peter. Where's Peter? He's gone, and so is Murphy. Not again! I know that bark, it's coming from outside. The dog got away. There he goes! Peter, come back! That's a heck of a chair. How many miles does he get to the gallon? Come on, we can catch up. Mama, that may be him. - Who? - The boy Murphy picked. We'll see later, we got to get to him first. And just where are we headed young man? Anywhere away from them, I'm not letting them get you. I appreciate the thought Pete, I really do, but they've got cars and all we've got is... Whoah, what you got under the hood there kid? That kid could show our stuntman a few tricks. No kidding! Slow down, you might hit him. I got it covered. Why did you do this? Mama, I don't understand why you did this. Mama, he could get hurt. That's why we got to catch him fast before anything bad happens. Step on it Sherrif, will you? You better pull over kid, I think you're getting a ticket. Not yet I'm not. Hey, where do you think you're going? Cross-country, they won't be able to follow. Pete, don't do it! I'll go back and face the music. This is too dangerous! No, I'm not giving up yet. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, and I thought the zip-line was bad! Yikes! Don't worry Murph, I've got this. Why are you slowing down? Follow him! Sorry ma'am, it sounds like we broke an axel or worse, we're going to have to try and follow them on foot. You stay here honey, mommy will be right back. I'm coming, I want to see. Okay. Be careful. Don't trip. I will. Let's go, they'll catch him. That speed demon's probably in the next county by now. It's impossible, there's a big drop-off where the railroad tracks come through. He would not be able to make it. Railroad? Gentleman please, I need your help. You ever ride piggy-back, girl? Sure, when I was younger. You wanna hop on one last time? Sure. I think we lost 'em! Check that. I think we lost us! Don't worry, Murph. I know exactly where we are. Peter! Peter! Peter! That's the 4:15 and it's never late. Run! Whoah, I didn't see that coming. Murphy? Murphy? Where are you? How much further to the tracks? Just up ahead. All I see are trees up ahead. Come on, we got to catch that dog. Murphy, you got to get off the tracks, the train's coming. Murphy! Please! Can you hear me? Murphy! You know, I think I can run faster than you. I bet you can. Oh, thanks a million, Pete. It's a miracle! A doggone miracle! That, and then some! Well, I guess we should go down there and secure the dog for the trip back. Wait, just wait. I've got a better idea. What's that, mama? Doggie 911. A QN Production. Staring Murphy the Wonder Dog, and Dirk Stevens. Murphy, owned and trained by Peter and Sydney Harris. Tonight's episode, "A New Beginning." Hey guys, welcome to the end credits. Look what we've got for ya. Lay down. Lay down. - Hire the girls, skip the dog. - Roll over. Roll over. Here we go, this is one of our executive producers. He's a lot better with money than he is with dogs. - Lay down. - See what I mean? Good. Speak. Speak. No, don't speak.

They squirted her with water with their trunks, and she loved on all the other animals. And one time we lost an animal, a little tiger ran into the forest. Sophie tracked it down because she's a Beagle and she's got a great nose. Scottie! Beam me out of here! Now! All right, I got to get out! Subtitles by explosiveskull
