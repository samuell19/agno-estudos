Every night is always same. Him inside and me out here. He gets pussy, I get blame. Him champagne and me warm beer. It is me who should be famous. Stupid fuck is taking piss. No boss treats good man like this. No, no, no, no, no. No one treats good man like this. Lover boy should try on my shoes. He is trying next re-entry. I freeze butt off playing sentry, me playing sentry, a fucking sentry! It is last time I work for him. Stupid fuck is taking piss. No one treats good man like this. No, no, no, no, no. No one treats good man like this. Tvoju mat! Somebody's coming, fucking great. We don't need this, yop tvoju mat, fucking great, I don't need this. No one treats good man like this. No, no, no, no, no. No boss treats good man like this. No, don't leave me now, I need you! Please, I'm begging you to stay! Anna, stop! You think you own me? There is nothing left to say. What's she doing? - I'll tell everyone you raped me. - Now your wit and charm escapes me! - Heartless bastard! - You're pathetic! - I'll scream, watch me! - No one's listening. - All this needy desperation. - You will rip my heart in two. This is going to get ugly! Then I'll have to fix that too. Hands off my daughter! Right now, don't touch her! Why? She's the psycho! - Just like her father! - Oh, you're not leaving. Do as I say. I must find way out, or we'll both pay. No, you're not leaving! Do as I say. I must find way out, or we'll both pay. Stupid old bastard! Let's try your way. Oh, my Goodness. Christ, I shot him, now he's dying! It's disaster! Something has happened. Please come. Just come. This is end of us forever. I can feel him slip away. What is left to do or say? Deep in heart is growing terror! This is end of us forever. I can feel him slip away! Leporello, let's go! I'm coming, but wish I wasn't! And old guy, he's... What happened? Bloody clown, don't be stupid. He's dead. Bravo! This is great evening's job. First you rape daughter, and then you kill father. Shut up! Don't piss me off! Just run, or I'll leave one more corpse on floor! Take it easy, okay? I say no more. What's become of my father? I'll see that scene forever, before my eyes. My father! I can't bear it! Why, why, my father! Barbaric! It's just impossible he's been shot! The bloodshed! His expression! So awful! How could this happen to my father? And now his body's still. God, he's not breathing! Daddy, wake up! Say something! Father, I need you! I'm dizzy. I don't know. Quickly! I need some help here. My love, I'm with you. Don't crowd her, please! Back off from her. She needs air! And some water! Move it, you idiots! Oh, Anna. Darling! My darling! I see so clearly, just how much he means to you. Breathe slowly. That's right, just take it easy. How's my father? Get on with it! He needs to be in hospital right now! Do you want him to die here? Anna, stay with me! He's strong, he'll live. I love you! Leave! If you love me, leave me! I have to stay beside him. I can't leave my father. I need to hold his hand! Listen, just listen, my Anna! Look at me for a moment. I swear to you, I love you! I live for you alone. I know, my love, my everything. I'm not myself now, forgive me! - My father, will he live? - Your father... Don't you worry. He will pull through, I promise! I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be everything to you! Swear they will find the bastard! He mustn't get away! I promise, I promise! I promise they will find him. I swear on my love for you! My mind is torn to pieces! Give me the strength to manage. A thousand mixed emotions burning within my heart! Juan! Well then, talk to me, fuckwit! What's the matter? - Things we must talk of are important. - I get it! - Are really important! - I really get it! Just tell me! With all shit you've done, which was, boss, work of asshole... - there's only one thing to do. You make... Confession! - Shit! You dare to tell me? - You give yourself up now! I do whatever I want to! Quiet! - Or I swear... - I don't say word. Okay, no more complaining. But he was policeman. Whole fucking force will want blood. They'll never stop until they get you. Not a fuckwit after all. Now learn some patience. We hold our nerve, and the thing will vanish. We're screwed if you lose it. So calm down, take deep breaths... - and let's focus on what needs to be done. Hang on! You smell that? Perfume like that means one thing... Not now, boss. You have nose of dog. Her ass is exquisite! It's just too good to waste. Seems you are all dog! Why can't I just forget him? He stole my heart and dreams. I can't deny I love him! My wounded heart still bleeds! Still I can feel his power. It's more than I can take! He must be mine forever, or else my heart will break She's so lonely, she's so lonely. I know my heart will break. Yes, I know my heart will break! I feel that I must help her to find salvation. Good thing she has no clue of your reputation! I know my heart will break. I know my heart will break. Miss, excuse me. Can I help you? No, thanks. - Well, look who we have here. - Oh shit, it's Elvira! My goodness! You're here. Monster, you creep, two-timing jackass! Elvira, I'm speechless. I'm so surprised to see you here. You should have called me to say you were in town. Right, so it's my fault, yet a-freaking-gain. You broke my heart, Juan. Changed my life, then crushed it. With all your sweet words, and all your promises. You said you'd never leave me, that our souls were connected. And you said we'd get married! I told my sister... - picked the dress and the flowers and the venue. It was all how I'd dreamt it. Then you don't call. No word from you, no e-mail. You just vanished! You left me! But, Juan... That dream never left me! And I need you. Do you not think I'm owed an explanation? - Good luck dealing with this one! - I had compelling reasons. What are they then? More of those sly inventions your silver tongue produces? No, no more crap from you, I've had it up to here. Enough, Elvira, don't be such a drama queen! I never lied to you about my feelings. But, as you've chosen not to trust me... - it seems a neutral point of view is needed! - You mean me, boss? - Just tell the truth, Lep! - How much truth can she handle? - She can take it. Tell her everything. So, lady, I'm not liar. But world is crazy... - and sometimes you think of a square is really. Circle! Are you crazy? You make no goddamn sense! Do you think it's funny? Look, Juan... Oh no. Please, God. Not again! Where did he go? Tell me, where's he going? It's best to forget him. You're lucky he's gone. Girl like you can find new man. It's not that easy! He's lied. Broken my heart! It's hard to tell you this, but you must know. You're nice girl, but one of many! Not his first love, not last one. Come here. I'll tell things about him, your Casanova... this man who you think loved you. I know the truth, though, all recorded in High Definition. You're just small piece of artistic ambition! Let me show you what your lover was up to. Every woman this dear man has taken... - each is filed under hair type and nation. You should sit down, there's much you must see. - In Italy, 640. - 640 what?! - Then in Germany, 230. - You are such an idiot! 100 in France, 97 in Denmark. But, in Espagna... But in Espagna, one thousand and three. Thousand and three! 1-0-0-3. He don't care if they are pretty. Country girl or are from city... common tart or high-class lady... - almost dead or nearly baby, waitress, model, student, pop star, fat or skinny. Fat or skinny, it's all same. In Italy, 640 Then in Germany, 230 100 in France, 97 in Denmark. But, but, but in Espagna... But in Espagna, one thousand and three... fuck! Thousand and three! 1-0-0-3. He don't care if they are pretty, country girl or are from city. Common tart or high-class lady, almost dead or nearly baby. Waitress, model, student, pop star, fat or skinny, it's all same. Fat or skinny, it's all same. He loves blondies... sexy and willing. Thinks they go for... his burning passion. And dark ladies... he finds thrilling. Fiery redheads... uuhhh! Always in fashion! In cold winter, with some meat on. Then in summer, he likes lean ones. Tall, majestic... super models. Chubby cute ones. Chubby, chubby... ...cute ones. I think much nicer. Even old ladies. Some over seventy! He takes for practice... and one more entry. But his favourite dish for dinner... she's a juicy sweet beginner. Sick or healthy, poor or wealthy... - old and ugly, young and pretty. Poor or wealthy, ugly, young and pretty! If she is female... and has heartbeat. I think you know... how he works. I think you know... how he works. If she is female, and has heartbeat. I think you know how he works. If you find him, the right one you'd better make sure you hang on to him! Don't you mess up the love of your life! You should use all you've got, get him hungry and then he'll do anything. If you just let him unclip your bra! Keep his hands full and he won't go far! Is there anything better than willing and wonderful women? And I've landed the best one of all, yes, of them all, yes of them all. Give them all that you've got, and you'll hear bells will start ringing All she wants is your money, your house and the keys to your car. Keep her happy and she won't go far! Come let's dance and let's drink and let's party! Does it get any better than this? A party? Well, well. Distraction's what I need, and they'll do nicely. So many pretty girls! You think one could distract me as well? Lovely people, good evening! Please don't let me interrupt the party. It's a wonderful night for some indulgence. Is this all for an engagement? Yes, exactly, and it's me getting married! Congratulations! Your fianc?? Yeah, can I help you? That's doubtful. But I was thinking... Perhaps it's me who could do something for you. Plenty, I'm certain, plenty. Oh, my fianc?'s already thought of everything! Not this I promise! I'd swear she's Aphrodite. - But what's your real name? - Zerlina. - And yours? - Masetto. You're a lucky man, Masetto. She truly is a goddess. With a face like hers a girl could make a fortune. What's that? Leporello, what do you think you're doing? So sorry, it's misunderstanding. I'm just filming because she's so pretty. Listen, I've had an idea. If you call Bruno, he'll open our restaurant. Order champagne and more vodka. Some food, lobster or French fries. Get whatever she fancies. Show these people a real party! One to remember. But listen, it's extremely important you take care of Masetto! - Did you get that? - Yeah, I got it. Let's go! - Hold on! - Something's wrong? - Zerlina, aren't you coming with us? - No worry, she's now in best hands. He's a gentleman and knows how to treat ladies. She's your Zerlina. I only need a word. - It's fine, we'll catch up soon. - It's okay, love. I'll be safe with him. Nothing will happen. - But I'm not happy. - Trust me. This could get me a job. Enough! I don't have time for this! Unless you want to spoil Zerlina's chance of a bright future... - I think you better leave, or you'll regret it! At last we have some peace. Free to talk and to think without your pet here. I don't mean to be cruel, but this is better. - He's only drunk and nervous. - Him? I see. You know you weren't created to live life with that loser. Another destiny awaits for eyes which shine like yours do. For lips so lovely. For the touch of your hand as smooth as silk. Perfumed with roses, and skin like milk. - Oh, I'm not sure I... - Sure about what? Of anything. Bloody men are all the same You say such nice things... - but I still need a little persuasion. And rich men are the worst ones. Right, so I'm a liar. Just a rich shallow bastard! But I've nothing to gain. There's no reason to lie! I'm as surprised as you are. Who would have thought it. Fate's given us this moment. We can't just waste it. Give me your hand, it's easy. I need to feel your touch. I have to have you with me. Our lives could change so much. My God, my pulse is racing. I want him and he knows. But who is this I'm facing? Will he just lie and go? Think of the life I'd give you! What am I getting into? You could escape your tether. I can't resist forever, resist forever... Closer, closer. Give me your hand, it's easy. My God, my pulse is racing. I need to feel your touch. I want him and he knows. Our lives could change so much. But will he lie and go? - Think of the life I'd bring you. - What am I getting into? - You could escape your tether. - I can't resist forever. Resist forever. You're mine. You're mine. I'm yours. You're mine, you're mine forever. Let's lose ourselves together... deep in this dream of love. You're mine, you're mine forever. Let's lose ourselves together... deep in this dream of love. Again, you cruel bastard! The world has had enough of all your lying! You're such a phoney! And that poor little girl you have there with you. Does she know what your game is? - Who is she? What's she saying? - Sweetheart, don't listen. She's a sad, lonely woman, who can't help what she's saying. I can't help it? You asshole! Look who's talking! It's you who can't help it when you lie to get women. What the hell's going on here? You'd better not be lying. This poor, obsessive creature is convinced I still love her. And, it's my fault, I'm too soft to exclude her. Though it finished long ago, still our memories delude her. Sure. - Juan, it's me. - Anna? How are you? How am I? He's dead, Juan. What were you thinking? But I've not told them... I'm so confused about what I should say. Then you don't say a thing! And I won't talk about it either. It was an accident. You know that. I must say something, for God's sake. He's my father. I know, it's such a tragedy. Anna, trust me! If you tell them, there'll be questions about us. You don't want that! I'll call you, in time, when it's all calmed down. For now, forget it! - Oh my God, what a nightmare! - What's the matter? Listen, please, you must help me! Just name it, Anna, I'm listening. I'm certain! I'm certain! Juan is the monster... who killed my father. Juan killed him? He just called on your phone. You must believe me. God, I'm shaking. It was Juan's voice I heard. There's no mistake! He was in my house. I swear it. But how? I thought you'd only met him yesterday? I don't get it. And he's my friend. I think it's time you told us all the details. Early this morning... fast asleep in my bedroom... - I was woken by something. I heard a noise. A man was there in the hallway! I couldn't see him, but I knew it was a stranger. My head was still sleepy. I was scared... scared to death! I just started to shake, I was sure he would kill me. Jesus! What happened? As he came close, he grabbed me. And I tried to break free. He held me tighter! I screamed and shouted. Pleaded. But no one came. He put his hand over my mouth. I could hardly breathe. I gave in. He was much too strong to resist. His body pressed against me. Horrible! And then? Then deep within... - a voice inside my head said to fight him. I lashed out hard. I know I hit him. I just couldn't let him rape me! Terrible! And I managed... ...somehow to break free. My God! Oh, Anna! I went crazy. That seemed to scare him. Then he just ran. I was so angry. I followed him to the entrance just to stop him. So suddenly, I'm chasing him, that cowardly bastard! Then in stepped my father... - as if sent by a God, to rescue me. And he pulled out a gun just to stop Juan from leaving. Juan jumped him, then they struggled. I heard a shot, then silence... He killed my father! I've had enough of crazy! These things are not worth ten times fee you pay me. Hey! Are you here? Incredible! Does nothing get through skull of yours, I wonder? My grumpy Leporello, things are just peachy! My "in denial" Juanitschka, they're fucking awful! Why are things so awful? Well, at party, I do just like you tell me. And everyone has good time. Bravo. I fill them with flattery. I tell them lies and bullshit! Just say anything so they feel happy! And all were easy targets. Concentrated hard on Masetto to distract him! I introduce nice girls so he is busy. Bravo, bravo, my little treasure! Made them drink vodka shots, men team against the women! And then started them dancing. They were all drunk! It was crazy, all was going so well. Then, out of nowhere, can you guess who invited self? - Zerlina. - Bravo! - You think someone comes with her? - Not... Elvira? - Bravo! And what did she say? - I'm a wanker who shouldn't be trusted! Bravo! You're so busted. - What did you do then, Lep? - Nothing. - Elvira? - Kept on going! And you? Well, if I'm honest, I got bored of her moaning! And I think to myself, now it's right time for leaving! I sneak away when she is noisy, I hid in back in darkness... - and kitchen door was open, so I used it. Bravo, bravo! You are brilliant! In fact a fucking genius! Juan? Just like I told you. Keep your nerve and you're free. We need to celebrate, take one more step to heaven. My work goes on tonight. And must forever! Break out the glasses, pour me some rapture... - we need to capture more for our game! Fresh meat's required, fuel for the fire... - drown me in beauty pleasure or pain! Nothing so ordinary as mere seduction, I need to tune them I will conduct them. I have to mould them into my fame, I need to tune them into my fame... - I will conduct them into my fame, I have to mould them into my fame. I have to bed them, fast as forget them. Swim in their essence, that is my aim. Ah... Only follow and by tomorrow you will be adding many more names. And by tomorrow you will be adding many more names. Fresh meat's required fuel for the fire, drown me in beauty, pleasure or pain! Ah... Only follow and by tomorrow you will be adding many more names. Nothing so ordinary as mere seduction, I need to tune them I will conduct them. I have to mould them into my fame. Ah... Only follow and by tomorrow you will be adding many more names. So, where is it? Masetto, wait for me. You've gotta listen. - I've said fuck off! - But why? You need to ask that? Filthy slut! You fuck him, and then you just say sorry? - Get your hands off! Don't touch me. - Come on! I didn't fuck him! You're not being fair. I don't deserve this. Bullshit! I think it's me who doesn't deserve this! You left with him, you tart. You left me right in the middle of our party. You made me look like a dick to the others! What a great start to marriage! You've ruined it all. For some cock you've lost everything! - You bitch, I... - Please, just listen, for once! You're being jealous without any reason. Look, nothing happened. Masetto, please believe me. I'm not a slut. You know how much I love you... You don't believe me? Right fine, then. Come here, hold me down Then punish me! Just hit me and slap me. Yes, just do it! But after you have finished... say you forgive me. Hit me, hit me, be my master. Beat your sweet and poor Zerlina. I won't flinch when you come nearer. I will take anything from you. Hit me, hit me. Your poor Zerlina. - Look, I'm not gonna hit you. - I won't flinch when you come nearer. I will take anything from you. Feel my body how it's shaking. It's all yours and yours alone. And it longs to melt and welcome... anything you say, my love. Yes anything, my love, my love. Yes anything you want. Hit me, hit me, be my master. Beat your sweet and poor Zerlina. I won't flinch when you come nearer. I will take anything from you. My love and master... ...come just hit me. I won't flinch when you come nearer. I will take anything from you. I will let you... Let you use me. I feel you want to, see you want to... and I want you. It's over. Just to hold me, let's forget it. I am yours, you won't regret it. We were made to live together... you and me together, my love. You and me, together my love. Come just hold me, let's forget it. I am yours, you won't regret it. We were made to live together. You and me, together my love. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You and me, together my love. Such great emotions waken. Our love can still be woken. Stay calm and play my part. I know it's in his heart. Our love can still be woken. I know it's in his heart. - Perfect, it's just what I needed. - Fill glasses up, see there is plenty. We must spin this to a frenzy. Laugh and smoke, drink and fuck, nothing else! - Hey Cristal! - And more vodka! Zerlina, be careful! - Manhattan! - White Russian! Hey, Zerlina, be careful! Let's go in for a moment and watch him. No point hanging around over here, no. No point hanging around over here. You look stunning, my lovely Zerlina! - Thank you, Juan. - Yet again with your flirting! - You're also real hot, lovely lady. - Lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. Ah, Masetto is losing it big time. We should never have come here at all! Ah, Masetto is losing it big time. He's so sad, while we're having a ball - That Zerlina is driving me crazy! - Ah, Masetto is losing it big time. Attention, lovely people! Some silence for our host, please! Yes, everyone is welcome. Freedom is king tonight. So kind to let us join you. But sometimes freedom lies. But sometimes freedom lies. - Yes, all are welcome. - So kind to let us join you. Freedom, freedom is king tonight. Freedom, freedom is king tonight. Somebody kick the DJ. Let's get this party buzzing! I am your greatest fan. Go on, the bar is open. - That little slut is with him! - I'm frightened. Stick to the plan! This is an awesome night! It's awesome, it's awesome, this is an awesome night. Masetto needs distraction. Hey, grumpy, need some action? - Please let me steal a moment. - Come here, my friend, let's boogie. Zerlina, over here. Get off, I don't do dancing. We could throw some romance in. - No! - Da! Handsome Masetto. I can't stay here much longer. No I don't want to! Come here my friend, let's boogie! You're setting heart on fire! Come up with me, my princess. Oh no, Zerlina! I'm sorry. I can't do it! What is idiot up to? He's made it all too easy. This time he's gone too far. Help me, help me, someone help me. I must help the girl and quickly. - Ah, Zerlina! - I don't want to! Over there I hear her screaming. I must hurry! Help me somebody, I don't want to. Please don't hurt me. I am here, and I will save you! And I will save you! Wait, I've got him! I'm disgusted! That this beast could work for me, could work for me. - Leporello! - It's some mistake here. - Why'd do you do it? - I have done nothing! - You're a monster! - That's enough, Juan! That's enough. Do you think that I am stupid? I know all about you now, about you now. - Right, Elvira... - Juan, how could you? - Nice to see you. - Glad to be here. - What's the problem? - You've betrayed me! I know everything you've done. We know! - Now's the time for retribution. - Ah, my mind is going to shatter. Now's the time for retribution. I feel cold rain start to patter. The dark clouds begin to gather. And expose just who you are. Hear the sound of our vendetta. It will grow into a whirlwind, ever stronger, faster turning... till it tears your world apart. Traitor! Traitor! What's he doing? But the fire in me's still burning... - and my will and strength's returning. You can't stop the world from turning. I will never fear what's in my heart! - Leporello. - It's over. I'm sorry. Take this. For the trauma. For trauma. For now we stick together. But no more of fucking lying or acting. We both in same shit and must think clear to beat it. Fine, enough has been said. We're back in business then and next stop will be freedom. If you keep mind off women? Me, keep off women? I've no power over that, they're a necessity. They are the air I am breathing, they are the blood in my body. But still you fuck them, then throw them in garbage. I love them all, Lep! How can one be enough when you love all the others? I, who must hold this intense desire within me... can't lie and keep it hidden. It's women, who, ignorant of my intentions... - think my pure honest love is an invention. I have never encountered man so generous and good... or one so modest. So now we run away? Wait, Lep! Whilst there is beauty left around us, I'm going nowhere. - Please, no! - It's fine, really. - No, Juan. Pigs will arrest you - We're going down! Be smart and do not argue! Be strong and just forget him. But my weak heart won't listen. The bastard. The worthless traitor. My pity is all he'll have. Bozhe, that is Elvira. Nice try, but now we're leaving. It's me you should believe in. Stay here and you will see. You know my voice, Elvira. You know my voice, Elvira. I knew you'd call, you bastard. Of course, my mind's much clearer... when I can talk to you. - Stop it! Each time we've spoken... - You think that she will buy this? After all, it's nothing new. It's me that winds up broken. I know that you can save me... that you can save me. Elvira, I must see you. Let's meet where we met yesterday. Come now. There's so much to say. - I don't believe a thing you say. - Please meet me there. - I'm so sorry. - You'll break her into pieces. I'm begging you, please come. All right, I'll be there! I can't believe I'm listening. Or how my heart is aching. Save me from this man. Oh God, he fills my heart and dreams. I can't believe I'm listening. To gaze at you and wonder... that simple pleasure... to see one smile returned... is all I'll ever need. If you deny my soul... such humble treasure... before your lovely eyes... my lonely heart will bleed. Your honeyed lips beguile me... eyes enrapture. Your skin's heavenly touch... my kiss must discover. Don't turn your eyes away. My heart is captured. Open your arms to me... your wounded lover. God, he's not coming. All my dreams... are worth nothing. I am so stupid. And why am I still crying? Why such emotions? His ungrateful heart deceived me. His heart deceived me. My heart's broken, is torn all apart. Still I love him... ...although he left me. Love, at last, please change his heart. Love, at last, please change his heart. No. I'm not heartless. I wish it were so simple. My heart's not yours, though... and for that, please forgive me. You're sweet, and faithful... and you don't deserve my weakness. So we can't be together. I need time... to find answers... and pray for rescue. Don't ever think... I didn't love you... that I wanted... to do you harm. Calm, calm... these raw emotions. Or your pain... and hate will kill me. Your hate will kill me. Maybe, maybe one day my heart will free me. And I'll learn to love again. To love again. Maybe one day my heart will free me... and I'll learn to love, love... And I'll learn to love again. Maybe one day my heart... will free me. And I'll learn to love again. Hey, Leporello! - Don't come closer! - Leporello, it's me. - I know, that's why I said it. - What have I done? You? - Not a thing. So sorry! - What's the problem? Pigs nearly caught me while you're getting blow job! You're free, though. And, it was worth it. Let's not argue again. Okay... All fine then. Come on. Come here, come here. Breathe freely while you can. Soon I'll be with you! - Christ, who said that? - What? I hear nothing at all, except for police cars. - You're looking kind of jumpy. - Quiet, listen. Who's there? Who is there? Your torment, temptation! I will bring you salvation. What's the matter? Some little fucking asshole thinks this is really funny... Look. Our friend the commander. He looks handsome in uniform. - Read me what it says underneath. - I think not. It's tiny little words there and light is really awful! Fucking read it! Relax! A warning to the coward who killed our captain: Be sure, revenge will find you. - It's bad here. Real scary. - Pathetic, weak and risible. Let's throw a party for him. - Go and ask if he'll join us. - You are mad. Too much coke has melted brain cells. You leave dead here in peace and think of us! They're looking. We must vanish. - Become ghosts just like him. - Do as I say. Or I will grant you your wish and you can join him! Easy... easy. Okay. I go and do it. Oh glossy, framed facsimile... of dead police commander... Juan, no! I cannot do this. It's really, it's really just too weird. No, finish it! Fuck the picture. It's me that you should fear. - This game is getting stupid. - You look so bloody funny! - And I don't want to play. - Go ask our friend to play! Dear picture, like I said before... although you're only paper... Bozje moj, bozje, bozje. You see that! He's looking right at you! - Ask him, ask him! - No, wait! No wait, I'll do it. I will do it. Dear sir, we're having party. It's him, not me, who's asking. He'd like that you come too. Now you are dead. Now you are dead. You see, he nods his head. You really are an idiot. You watch him! You'll see he really did it! What is it I must see? That I must see? Though he is simple picture... ...his head fell down like this. Though he is simple picture... his head fell down like this. You'll come then? You've accepted... my invitation? My invitation? Yes! - Horrible situation. - Incredible situation. - He's sick with desperation. - This ghost accepted my invitation. I've had enough. I'm leaving. So many preparations. The time has come to go. Incredible situation. He accepts my invitation. So many preparations. The time has come to go. Can I ask you, what the hell are we doing? We're getting some food! Shit... shut up. The chicken. Juan! Fucking hell! Get it in a bag! As I promised... we are together. You invite me... and I accept it. Though my mind tries to reject it... - you are here. So it must be. Leporello, another bottle. We must show our friend some manners. Cut it out! Cut it out! - Why you talk when no one answers? - Lep, just do it! Listen to me! There is nothing on earth... that can fill me. My desires... lie beyond your experience. I am here... only for your deliverance. I am here... so at last... you can see... - Stop it. It's no longer funny. - Speak, I'm listening. What is it? Who are you? Still you don't even listen to me. Listen! Time's flying. Take heed of my plea. Speak then, speak. What do you want from me? Listen! Time's flying. Take heed of my plea. Speak then, speak then. What do you want from me? You gave an invitation. Now I return the favour. Believe in me. Believe in me. You'll brave your fears... and drink in my house? Oh no, oh no! You must come round, you'll kill us! I've never been a coward. I'm not afraid to go. Decide then. I have decided. - You're coming? - Please drive more slow! My heart is strong and steady. I'm not afraid. I'll go. Give me your hand to seal it. Certainly. Oh... Christ! - Your face! I can't believe it! - Penitence is within you. And this is your last moment. No, I'm not repentant. Go! I've no more to say! Confess for all this suffering! You can't be me. You're nothing! - Give in to me. - No! - Give in to me! - No! - Yes! - No! Time's up. Now you must pay. What is this pain that grows in me? I feel my soul unravelling. Insane low voices babbling. My mind is ripped apart! Feel our cold touch, our hunger. Slowly we'll eat your heart. - What is this pain that grows in me? - His eyes are full of sadness. - I cannot stay and save him. - It tears my soul apart! - Such molten fire suffuses me. - His eyes are full of sadness. I cannot bear this agony! The terror, God! I'm burning. I cannot stay and save him. The terror! I'm on fire!
