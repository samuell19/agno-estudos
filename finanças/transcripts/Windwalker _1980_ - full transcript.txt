I will search for elk, my father. Why are there tears? Gratitude for a son. Take care of your grandfather, my children. He is sick. He needs comfort. Don't worry My eyes are dim, but I still see. I am a burden to my family. Grandfather, we will take care of you. Are you afraid to die? No, it is time for this old body to nourish the earth. But I was not always old. You were once a boy? Old men do not grow from young girls. He was a great warrior. I need a wife to give me children. They are swift and strong. You have one wife already. I have counted many coups. Ah, foolish boy. Get away! Get away! I said get away! I will come back later. Eight skins. More than she is worth. Old friend, these horses are for you. I would share my life with your daughter forever. You have shamed this warrior. I am no longer welcome among the Cheyenne. I am leaving. Keep your woman. We are enemies until one of us dies. Our father is one of these sons? Where is our father's brother? Did you hear me? Get the wood! Get some help! Do not be afraid, little one. Do not be afraid. I am your father. You are my son. I am your father. You are Cheyenne. You are Cheyenne. You are Cheyenne. Come quick! Good journey, my father. The great white horse of the Cheyenne. A great warrior rides this horse. Nice little woman, that one. I will take her into my lodge with me. She will kill you, fool. More pleasant to die under a Cheyenne woman's blanket, than under the hooves of a war horse. We must have a horse. This warrior and his horse, they are like one. The one will take us to the other. He cannot be caught. Let us circle until the sun sleeps... then come again to this place. I'm hungry. We are all hungry! She cannot help her pain. Oh Great One... I have not heard with my ears, but now I understand with my heart. Do not fear. This old man is no spirit. I was called back! He grows weaker. He must eat. I have brought food. The Crows fell upon us. They are still in the hills... The Great One has sent you back to us! Enough of this. He has counted coup and shamed us. He is great warrior. We kill him but he disappears. And his great horse. Maybe the medicine of his ghost horse is too strong for us. I fear no enemy's medicine. I will find him. I will hang his scalp on my belt. It will not be long now. I will have this... "ghost horse". We have taken two horses. That is honorable. I will have the white stallions, and the heart of this enemy. And I will have his little woman. This Cheyenne is no common warrior. He will kill you all. You speak like a woman! Pride blinds your eyes. This Cheyenne bleeds like every man, and he will die like every man. You have no courage. Does it take courage to fight a woman and children for this horse? We shall find and take all their horses. And my woman, by sunset. This is honorable. Then we will go. Grandfather, where did you get this big bear skin? From a big bear. That's where? How did you come to be alive? Was it not a good day to die? Ah, so many questions. But that is good. It's a very long story. I have many questions myself. I have yet to fully understand why this old man... was brought back from the land of the sky people. Grandfather? Will the Crows come again? Yes, they will come again. It is shameful to follow this wounded warrior and his woman. If you fear his strange medicine, then do not ride with us. Go on... You are all fools! I do not want to be part of it. Then leave us! It is too soon for you to be warriors. You hearts are brave, but they are small. Today our hearts are full of one another. We must fight... We must fight! May all who pass come in peace. He must die for Smiling Wolf! No. Bind him. He shall not die. They are close. They warn us! Who is afraid? Oh Great One, give us strength. Do not fear death. As spring begins with winter, so death begins with birth. It is only a step in the great circle of life. Fight without fear. You are Cheyenne! You are Cheyenne! I am not Crow. I am Cheyenne! I am Cheyenne! I am Cheyenne! The lost one! I have found my son. For this you have kept me so long. Now I understand... My son is returned to me! This enemy insults me! An old man comes to fight his battles. This is a joke! Where is the great warrior? No, Evil Eye, many seasons ago you stole my son. Have not these years caused enough heartache? Let there now be peace between us. Now I know the truth. I am not Crow. Let us part in life, not in death. My medicine is strong. This is my emblem. You raised me, but I am no longer your son. You should die. But I let you go... In peace. My heart is with my true family now.
