(gunshot resounds) - So? You think you'll come up with the money this week, babe? Hmm? - Yeah, I'll have the money. - Yeah? (squeals) Yay! Good, because I saw a beautiful sofa at the mall which I think is gonna look beautiful in our new home. As a matter of fact, you're gonna hate me but I put it on layaway. (giggles) And tomorrow you might even get a bigger surprise. Isn't this amazing, babe? How everything is just falling into place? Huh? I'm so happy. Aye Papi, what's wrong? It's like you're not even here. Come on, this is supposed to be happy times. Come on, baby. Forget about business, yeah? That's why I didn't even tell you that Frankie called. - What? (Serena screams) - Oh you (cursing in Spanish) what the fuck? Why does it have to be about Frankie and the boys all the time? - I told you tell me if Frankie called, did I not tell you that? Did I not tell you that? - Fuck you! I am so sick of this shit. It's the same thing that happened last time before you went to fucking jail. Puta, what the fuck! (door slams) - I'm sorry, just had to get some of your papers. - Ah, don't worry about it. - Well, it looks like your FICA score is way below average. I mean like 480. - Is that bad? - Well it isn't good. I tried to see if I could get you through to my broker, but it looks like I'm afraid your loan application has been declined. - What do you mean? It can't be. - I'm sorry, but with no collateral, your below average credit rating, plus several serious delinquent accounts, I mean the list goes on and on. I'd love to help you, but my hands are tied unfortunately. - I gotta get this loan. I mean, I'm trying to get this house. And there's gotta be a way. Can you check again? I'm sure that you can make this go through. - No way with your credit score. - I'm sure there's a way you can make this go through. Can you check again? - I'm sorry, no collateral is just not gonna cut it. Why don't you take one of my pens? It has my info on it. Your credit score regenerates every seven years, so who knows? Give it some time, and then come back. (paper rustling) (distorted screaming) - You fucking idiot! - Why you yelling at me? - Get the fuck away. Get the police, oh my god. Get an ambulance.

Stop! (overlapping orders) - What's the surprise, huh? - I am not telling you, not yet. (motorcycle revving) Did you see that guy? He just flipped me off. What? What are you? Dave, it's not worth it. Dave, stop! - Come on! - Babe! - The hell is your problem? Be careful, watch it! Dave stop, get in the car! Dave, hurry up! - Holy shit. - Dude that was crazy. (panting) - What the fuck? - He's got a gun, Dave! - [Dave] Shit! (glass shattering) - Damnit! - Oh my God! (tires squealing) (dramatic music) He's messing with us, why? Who is this guy? - I have no idea! (tires squeal) (motors rumbling) - Oh my god, okay. - What are you doing? (Serena screams) - I'm calling the cops. - No don't call the cops! - Why not? What'd you do? Oh you did something stupid, didn't you? - I didn't do anything! - Fuck! You did something stupid, Dave. - I did nothing! - I know you. (tires squealing) Hurry up! - I'm going as fast as I can. - Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - I'm going! (motor whirs) - Wait I can't see him. - Dammit! - Oh my god, watch it! (tires screeching) - Come on, come on, come on. Piece of shit truck! Not now, come on! Dammit! This guy's a nut job. (ominous music) - Who is he? - I don't know. - He's coming. (engine stalling) - Dammit. - What? - Goddammit! - What? - Dammit! - What happened? - The engine died. - [Serena] Try to turn the car on. - [Dave] What do you think I'm doing? - He's coming, Dave. - I'm trying! Come on start! Start! Start! (man laughs) - Hurry up! For real. (engine turns over) Run him over! Run the fucker over! (tires shriek) (gunshots popping) (engine roars) (motor revving) (tires screech) - Let's go, go! Get in, hurry up! Get in, get in. (gasping) - Oh my god. Oh, Oh my god. (motor growling) Oh shit! You better start explaining. Now! (latches clink) (dramatic music) Oh shit. - I sort of robbed a bank, baby. - How do you sort of rob a bank, baby? Huh? Tell me you either did it or you didn't. - Well, I did. - Oh my god. That's why they're trying to kill us. That's why. I mean banks don't send shooters to find their money. Whose money is that? - I don't know. Okay, I told you. I robbed a bank, that's all I know. - What are you thinking? What are you thinking? (Serena crying) Oh baby. You know, you know Papi, that surprise I had for you? I'm pregnant! Okay, thank you for making this the best and the worst day of my life. Oh my god! (sobs) Oh goddammit, goddammit. I'm pregnant with your baby. You have me living in Frankie's office on a sofa and now you rob a bank. No, babe. - Look, look, look. Listen to me, listen to me. There's enough money in that case for us to run away and really disappear, okay? Hey, we can still be a family, okay? But we don't have much time. (Serena crying) - Do the other guys know about the money? Huh? - No they don't. They wouldn't understand. To them it's just a bunch of money. - They've been calling. They've been calling all day asking what was in that bag? What's in that bag? I had no idea what was in that bag. They said, Frankie's pissed. Frankie's pissed. And I'm so done with this, babe. I'm so done. You gotta think about something, please. You have to make a plan. It's not just about you and your idiot boys. It's about my life. It's about your baby's life. It's about us now, okay? Please, I'm gonna stick with you. I'm gonna trust you to the end, but you have to make the right decision. You have to, baby. Please this time it really matters. - Okay, okay. - Aye Papi. - I love you so much. I'm gonna take care of you. - I love you, too. - I'm gonna take care of you, baby. It's okay. - I love you. (crashing) (Serena screams) - How come you didn't call me when you got the money from the bank? And how the fuck did you find out that cop kept it there? - Cop? What cop? What are you talking about, man? I got lucky, I guess. - You're fucking lying. And guess what? Your luck just ran out. - Frankie, please, can't we just work this out, Frankie? - Shut your mouth and sit down! As a matter of fact, tie her ass up and tape her mouth shut, because we're throwing this bitch in the trash when we're done here. - You got it, Frankie. - Where's the fucking money? (Serena screams) - [Henchman] Watch her! (gunshot) (shotgun pumping) (Frankie laughing) - Heh heh, shut up! I should've done this a long time ago, Frankie. - Take it easy. All you gotta do is give me the money. I walk outta here and we're good. - We both know it's not gonna happen that way, Frankie. I got as much of a chance of getting away with the money as I do without. So you know what? I'm gonna take my chance. - You're gonna regret this. - [Dave] No, you're gonna regret this. So just get on your knees, okay? And shut up. - Get on your knees, bitch! - You heard the lady, get on tour knees you punk ass bitch. So this is what I need you to do. (car engine humming) (suspenseful music) (Car door shuts) - Where's Frankie? We need to see him. - Not here, back up. (gunshot) - [Rojas] (gasps) No! You've gotta be kidding me. - You shot me? (gunshot) - Drop the gun. - Lou? - Drop the gun! (gun clattering to the ground) Good girl. Shut your mouth and get inside. - What the hell are you doing? - Just get in there! - And beg like the bitch that you are. I'm sick of you! - [Frankie] Fuck you. - Shut up! - [Rojas] What the fuck are you doing? (gasps) (shotgun blasts) (shells dropping) Hold it, police! - This is the police. Everybody put your guns down. You don't want anyone to get hurt here. - [Serena] Thank god you're here. - [Frankie] It's about time you showed up, Andreas. - Hey Frankie, you got my money yet? - I was just about to find that out. I got things under control. Now let me do what I do. - Control? Yeah that's what it looked like when we busted in here. - Haha. - Haha, yeah, well let me do what I do. (gunshot) (Frankie gasps) - What do they mean your money, Lou? (gunshot) Oh! - Fuck. - Bitch asked too many questions. How you been, Dave? You got my money? - What money, man? What are you talking about? - You know, you stole a briefcase with lots of money in it? Mine. - [Serena] Oh my god. - Where is it? Now! - It's under the couch. Baby, just give him the money. - [Lou] Good boy, attaboy. - Here's the money. Here's the money. Don't kill us, okay? I'm pregnant, we just wanna start over. Okay? Just take the money? - Is it all there? - All of it. - Yes. It's all there. It's all there. Lou? You're a cop? - Yeah, for some time now. And I heard you did a few years back when, huh? - Oh wait, Lou it's you? Lou please let us go. Please? Just take the money? (sirens wailing) Just let us go. - Get the fuck out of here. You get a solid. Get the fuck out of there. Get out of here. (sirens blaring) You messed up, Frankie. Boy did you mess up. (sirens wailing) - You better get it together. You better realize what you're doing. 'Cause everything's a cause and effect. One thing effects the other! (magical melody) So you gotta think before you act. Life is about decisions. Dave and Serena? They made the right choice. Now what you gonna do? I think you know. Now go ahead, get out of here. (magical melody) (man laughing) - What's up boys? Young lady? When you wanna make some money, give me a call. - Hey Dave, I thought Frankie was dead? - Yeah, me too. - Right, Lou? - Weren't you guys listening? There's always a Frankie around. Come on, let's go.
