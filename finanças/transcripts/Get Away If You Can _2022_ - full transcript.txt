[dramatic music] [waves crashing] [thunder cracking] [engine running] [tense music] - [engine running] - [waves crashing] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [kettle whistling] Let me see that. Babe, I'm really tired. Please, I just wanna rest. I've been out there for days. Babe, please come on. - Come rest with me. - Come on. Just give me a moment. Okay? [waves crashing] [tense music] [waves crashing] [tense music] Land! Have some wine with me. [Domi] Okay, I'll go in a minute. Bottle of reds. Bottle of red. Come on. We're almost there. Couple more days. I feel like I really just wanna get there, you know? I hear you. I say that I think you really need like a break and I say we're right here. Why don't we take one day off and just relax onshore? - No... - [Domi] Why keep on making this eternal? - It's like the eternal trip... - No, it's not that, baby... [Domi] The eternal trip to nowhere. No, come on. Don't say that. - Come here. - Well, it seems like that. Have some wine with me. Come here. [Domi] For going to the island. Yes, we're gonna go to an island. Nice. Really? But not this one. - Come on. - Come on, we're right here. Baby, we have a plan... - I don't want to have wine. - We're gonna hit Easter Island. It's gonna be beautiful. We're gonna have good surf. We're gonna have sun. Christian, Easter Island is too, too much time. I wanna stay here. They call these islands the Islands of Despair, the islands... This is the boat of despair for me. The Islands of Despair, Domi. We're gonna go on a rock? The Islands of Despair? Come on. You don't stop at the Islands of Despair. Hey, don't raise your voice, - I'm right here. - I'm just saying... - I'm right here. - It's kind of funny. You don't stop on the Islands of Despair. You go past the Islands of Despair to paradise, Domi. [Domi speaking in Spanish] Domi? What are you getting up now? Now you're talking Spanish to me. - I don't understand Spanish. - I don't feel like drinking wine. You know, what are we celebrating? That we are staying here forever and ever in this boat? - This is always the case with you. - Come on, we are right here. It's a tiny little dingy. We just have to row for five minutes and we're in a beach. I made a plan and we stick to the plan. Okay? I'm gonna have us on a beach that's warm. - I'm not part of this plan? - Where I can surf... - I'm not part? - Where you can scuba dive - and we can have a great time. - Who am I? - I wanna know... - No, no! - I don't wanna hear you. - Hey, shut the fuck up. - Just shut up for a second. - You are so selfish, you know? So selfish all the time. What do you mean? We're right here. We can get down. We can relax. You know, you never look at the bright picture. You're always negative about everything. [TJ] Domi, the answer is no, we don't stop here. Well, fuck you then. Domi, it doesn't have to be a fight. Come here. [Domi] I understand that it doesn't have to be a fight. That's why I'm suggesting let's just stay here one night. - Okay, look... - [Domi] Let's take a walk. Let's watch the sunset. Let's, you know... [TJ] I hear what you're saying. So? But we're not gonna stay here. That's the final word. But why not? Just because you don't want to? It's not because I don't want to. It's not in our plan. We have a plan to get on a schedule to the place that we're going, - where it's nice and warm. - What schedule? What schedule? [TJ] Domi, don't make everything a fucking argument. This is a year. What schedule? - I don't understand. - Don't make everything an argument. I don't wanna keep saying - the same thing... - I don't wanna talk to you. [Domi speaking in Spanish] No, don't start talking Spanish, Domi. Don't say no. Who are you to say no? No. I say no. No. [Domi] That's why I'm talking Spanish, 'cause I can't believe you shout... Oh, you make me so fucking angry. I said, no, we're not stopping on this island. [Domi speaking in Spanish] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [Domi speaking in Spanish] [gentle music] [TJ] We don't stop. We don't stop. We don't stop. It's a fucking rock. We don't stop. We don't stop. It's a fucking rock. Listen to me.

Domi! Domi! Domi! Indian shit. This is from her, right? The pothead, travel around the world on my dime, wannabe artist. You know, maybe if you weren't jealous, you wouldn't be saying that kind of stuff about my wife... This has got nothing to do with me. I'm fine on my own. Better even. This is about you. You know you had your time traveling around, living like fucking gypsies. I supported it. Now you're back here. You're doing the work. You're doing a great job. It's great having you here, but you got to keep that focus. What the hell's the matter with you? - No. I'm fine, dad. - [Alan] You're fine? Yeah. [Alan] You're not fine. Hello! Hello! Hello! Domi! Domi! Domi! Domi! It's incredible really. You're stubborn. No connection with reality. [TJ] Hello! [Marina speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [dog whimpering] Domi! [tense music] If you're going to do this, do it right. Chart everything out. Stick with the plan. Don't take any stupid risks. People die every day at sea. I got it all charted, Dad. It's gonna be amazing. Yeah? I didn't get to the most important part. On a boat there's one captain just like normal life. It's essential that this woman knows her place. It's just primal, son. You establish yourself the leader. Right now she thinks she's got you wrapped around her little finger. You gotta be strong. Don't back down. She keeps up with this bullshit just throw her overboard. [tense music] [TJ] Domi! Domi, I see the boat. Where are you? Domi, I see the tent. Domi this is not fucking funny. Come here. Go away from here. Don't come here. Get back in the boat. This is not funny. - This is not safe. - No. I want you to go away. Get out. Domi, you have to come back to the boat. This is very dangerous. [Domi speaking in Spanish] I'm staying here. I'm not going. [TJ] Fuck! Get out. What are doing? Don't come here. Why don't you listen to me? I'm saying go away. Do you know how dangerous this is? Stop it. I don't want you to come here. Don't come here. Domi, you have to get the fuck back on the boat. What don't you understand? I'm saying I don't want to see you here. This is my place. I came here. I left the boat. That fucking boat. - Domi, listen to me. - No. No. - Listen to me. - No. You made me leave that boat. I can't anymore. This is my place. I want you to go away. - [TJ] Listen to me. - No. Listen to me, Domi. Please. I love you. Okay? - Is that what you wanna hear? - No. Get outta here. - Domi, don't fucking hit me! - Don't say that. Don't say that. - Don't say that. - What is your problem? Don't hit me. Who you think you are saying I love you now? When I've been calling for you since months. - [TJ] Domi. - Get out of here. - You want me to leave? - Go away. - You want me to leave? - Yes, I want you to. Fine, I'll leave you on this fucking island. - Yes. - Fine. [upbeat music] I can't take you seriously with that haircut. You gotta get your money back from whoever did that to you. What is it anyway? I mean, are you trying to cover up your bald spot or something? - Dad, it's just a style. - It's not a style. It's half a haircut. It's half short. It's half long. It's half man. It's half woman. It's half gay. It's half military. It's everything that's wrong with this world. I don't know about all that. You just let it go, naturally, like your old man. You know, balding is a sign of strong testosterone. It's your move. [Domi] I'm looking at old pictures and it gets me so horny when I see them. [TJ] Look, I've gotta get to work. We can do this another time. But take the morning. Stay with me a little bit. [TJ] I wish. I can't, love. I'm sorry. [TJ] You wanna hear an interesting thing, Dad? Back when pilgrims first came here, you know, before this was the America we know and love. First invaded here, I should say, 'cause they did invade here. There were cases where, you know, some of the Native Americans went and lived with the Whites, you know, and took on their way of life. And there were also cases where Native Americans somehow or another ended up with the... Or what am I saying here? There were cases where Whites somehow or another ended up with the Native Americans, you know, living off the land, all feral and shit. In teepees. You follow me? Are you going to fucking move some time today? There you go. That was weak. Native Americans called Indians. Don't start with this PC bullshit. Well, my point is this, right? The Indians, when given the chance, ran back to their old life. Not a question, no hesitation. But the Whites, it was a different story. They stayed with the so-called savages. They gave up their way of life. You don't find that crazy? [Alan] You been surfing? I mean, I haven't been getting out. No. You know, when the surf's up, you can come in later any time. - You know that. - I know. Jesus, guy doesn't even want to surf. She's got you so twisted up. Women, women, women. Jesus. Come on, I need a smoke. It's checkmate in five anyway. Whatever. Yeah, whatever's right. [TJ] Do you just want me to go? You're not going anywhere. Just relax. I got wisdom for you. I mean it. Just listen to your old man. I'm listening. I love you. All right? This business is for you. But you've gotta stay in your lane. When you take over you make the big money. Create a life for yourself. That sound like a plan you should stick with? Yes? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Yes, what? Yes, sir. And we can't have this woman fucking that up with her crazy shit. Let's drop it. Yeah, enough already. [Marina speaking in Spanish] [man speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] Hey, you still got that? Oh, yeah, yeah. Reminds me when we were kids. Takes me back to the sea. And you know, with all this craziness, it calms me. - You gotta get that? - Oh, God. Yeah. I mean, I should. You know, it's a work day. You know how that... How often are you here? [Alan] I'm worried about your brother. This woman, she's bringing him down, big time. [Graham] Yeah, well, he married an Argentine Taurus, so what do you expect? [Alan] I just feel like I'm on borrowed time before she starts screwing with his head again. I mean, you're better off on your own, right? [Graham] No question. And you got the gift of the golden tongue. - [cell phone buzzes] - See, I need you to talk to him. Set him straight. I mean, you know, you're set up here great. I'm really proud of you, but I want him to take over the business from, you know, from me. She's gotta go. He's gotta get rid of her. I'm calling it Operation Dismiss Domi. Come on. No, I'm dead serious. I need you in on this. [Graham] Ah, Dad. I don't know. You don't know what? Bottom line is she's got his head all fucked up and I am not leaving here until you promise me you'll talk to him.

Food's almost up, guys. Make yourselves at home. All right, food's up. Come on, Dad. Look at this plate. Have a seat. That looks good, amor. - We're missing the wine. - Ah, I got it. I got it. I got it. No, no. Sit, sit. It's in the car, I'll be right back. [gentle music] Dad, what happened? I don't know. She just got up and left. I'm not sure what happened. That steak's really good though. You should sit down. Let's eat. [thunder crashing] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [TJ] Domi packed up, Dad. Left me for South America. You smiling, Dad? - That's my wife. - No, no. I know. I know. I know. But maybe, just maybe it's for the better. - [TJ] Dad, it's 10. - Fuck it. Look, I know you're hurting, man. I know that. But time will heal you. Just gotta get back on the horse. [ship horn blaring] Listen, son, Operation Dismiss Domi is almost complete. She took off for South America. But I really need you to call your brother ASAP. That's an order. All hands on deck. Keep him on point. You don't want him doing something stupid, you know, like leaving the country or something. So give him a call. We've almost got him away from her. Talk to you later. [women exclaiming] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [Domi speaking in Spanish] [Marina speaking in Spanish] [gentle music] [Graham] I'm telling you, man, it's for the best. [TJ] You think? Really? [Graham] She was driving you crazy. You know, she was relentless. It was time to move on. I hate to admit it, but Dad's right this time. [TJ] I think it was my fault, and I... [Graham] No, it's not your fault. Shut the fuck up. This is life, man. Life moves on. You know, things end, and fucking women are impossible. - You know that? - [TJ] Yeah? I don't want to hear all about all that right now. [Graham] It's time that you go to work. All right? It's time that you provide. If she can't understand that, then fuck her, dude. [TJ] I don't need a lecture, please. Please. [Graham] You need a woman in your life who raises you up. Who wants you to be the man that you want to be. [TJ] Yeah, but dude, dude, this is not the time for a lecture, man. We fucking... I don't know. We had something. I don't know what it was, but something great, man. Like, I can't put my finger on it. It's fucking gone now, dude. I don't know how to get it back. You have something to help me with that, or are you going to fucking lecture me all day? You need to listen to me, please. There has been a dramatic shift. A dramatic shift in the last century. I mean, men, they're being told that they're not good enough, that women have the power. That's not fucking true. [TJ] Ah, you sound like dad, dude. [Graham] Yeah, let me finish my point and I'll tell you. We as man have been told that we should apologize. Ah, man, are you fucking kidding me? Hey, don't hang up. Did you just hang up? Motherfucker, he hung up on me.

[TJ] Why do you treat me like this? 'Cause I don't wanna be with you. [TJ] Domi, come on. What can I say? Go to your boat. I miss you. I don't care. Take the fish. - No, no, no. - Let me have dinner.

Look, I haven't been completely honest with you, okay? I might have... I might have taken some chances with your finances. [TJ] You took some chances with my finances? [Graham] Yeah. That rhymes. Isn't that weird? Listen, I know what the plan was, okay? But I gambled a little bit and I won. We won. You won. [TJ] I won. I won what? [Graham] You got enough here to be set up for a while. You got something here. Okay? And if you play this right, if you listen to me, there's an outside chance... There's an outside chance you can get her back. You got a plan to get her back.

You're breaking my heart. [gentle music] You really don't get it, do you? I'm trying to help you out here, trying to save your life. Did you even talk to your brother? Yeah, he thinks I'm fucking crazy. [Alan] At least I got one kid who makes sense. Jesus, you're a fucking idiot. You know that? Yeah. I know it. [gentle music] [Alan] You're not going. [TJ] What do you mean, I'm not going? It's done, Dad. - It's done? "It's done," he says. - Yeah. What makes you think you're gonna have a job when you get back here? [TJ] You gotta do what you gotta do. I gotta do what I gotta do? I'm gonna have us on a beach that's warm, where I can surf, where you can scuba dive and we can have a great time. No. No, I don't wanna hear you. Just shut up for a second. Whatever magic you think you're gonna get back from this cunt... Hey, don't talk about my wife that way. I'll talk about her any goddamn way I want to. God! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Fuck her. Fuck you. [gentle music] [upbeat music] [TJ speaking in Spanish] [upbeat music] [TJ speaking in Spanish] [upbeat music] [upbeat music] It's so beautiful. I miss you so much. [singing in a foreign language] And when are you moving in? - You want me to move in? - Yeah. But I have such a nice place now. No, I'll go over there. No, no, no. You've done a better job. Soon. Tomorrow. Okay. Well, what do you say if we stay here one or two more weeks, and then we finally go and search for those warm waters? I'm really cold here in this island at night. No, let's make it work here, baby. Forget warm waters. This island has it all for us. I don't wanna go anywhere. Yeah, but I'm running out of supplies. I need to go get some things from the boat. Baby, let's just make it work here. Forget the boat. Let's go today, grab some stuff. I really need to go get some stuff. I don't have anything. I'm lacking everything. Let's go now. [tense music] Baby, I let the Coycoy go. I sent it out to sea. What do you mean, you sent the boat to sea? What are you talking about? I... I don't understand, TJ. The boat, I sent it to sea. It's gone. I thought that's what we wanted. I let it go. I sent it out to the water. Let it go where? To sea. Where to sea? Like, what are you saying? Relax, baby. I'm just kidding. Kidding? You can't joke. My stomach is all tight. I would go to the boat now. Can you take me today? Ah, yeah, baby. Wait, where are you going? To the boat. Take me to the boat. I want to go grab some things... [tense music] We can't stay here forever. I mean, let's go to the boat and... [TJ] Yeah, we can. It's great. This has been the best part of my whole life. Everything's coming together. I mean, we were miserable on the boat. We were miserable in the city. This is the place for us. [Domi] Yeah, but my... My... I need to go grab some stuff. Like, we can't just stay here forever. Like, what are you talking about? Where's the boat? Where did you park the boat? Like, where is it? Are you talking for real? Is it real? Is it a joke? [TJ] I let it go. - [Domi] Let it go where? - [TJ] It's gone. [Domi] Where? What do you mean, you let it go? Let it go where? [TJ] I... I thought... I sent it to sea. Like I said, I thought that's what we were gonna do. [Domi] But send it to sea, what does that mean, send it to sea? [TJ] Gone. Autopilot, out to the ocean. It's just us here forever. It's good. - No? - No! Where's the boat? [TJ] Oh, it's okay. It's okay. [Domi] What do you mean, we're here forever?
