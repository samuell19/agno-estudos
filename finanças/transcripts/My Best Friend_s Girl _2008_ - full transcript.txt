I'm-- I'm really glad we had this talk, you know? Dude. You check out that sandwich they got downstairs? Bread is, like, two slices of freaking pizza, man. - Only in America. - Fuck me. Man, on phone: Clean air probably shouldn't stink like flaming ass nougat. I got a real fucking tough guy over here. I got a guy on the verge of a five-state killing spree. - Do you wanna--? - Yeah. Ready? Three, two, one. Both: Sir, let me transfer you to my supervisor. - Make me proud. - Kill it. Hi, this is supervisor Eugene Lenay. Both: How may I help you? Please hold. - (Beeps) - (Exhales) Treat her like a bowling ball. Strike. Dust, hold on one second, all right? Sir, I looked into the problem, and it'll actually fix itself. - What's up, kid? - You failed, Tank. - She wants to see other people. - Okay. Wait, what? She said she wants to see other people? Yeah, yeah, she did. That's why you're gonna take her out again. Except this time, you're gonna get seriously diabolical. Okay? I'm talking, uh, public defecation. Dust, you're freaking me out here, okay? Tanking is a subtle art. You can't go in there crazy like a dragon with a hemorrhoid. Tank: Besides, why do you think she'd ever wanna speak to me again? Dustin: Don't worry, I'm taking care of that. No, you're not. You do-- Dust. Don't do anything, okay? Listen. I have to teach a training seminar 10 minutes ago. Dusty? (Gargles, spits) - You're late, Tank. - I know. - You're Tank, right? - Are you a cop? No. No, Roger’s friend, Sonny, said you fix things. - Walk with me. - Oh. - You're late. - Thank you. I'm going crazy without her. Like shit-in-the-bed-and- roll-around-in-the crazy. - You're late, man. - Shut up. Religious girl. I know. How do I bump into her? - You're late. - No shit. She's a high-school English teacher. So there's that. Guy can't really hang around a school now. Unfortunately. - Oh! Gets her hair done Tuesdays. - Ooh. Love it. What did you do? Did you put your foot in your mouth? Foot-long in somebody else's mouth? Facts. Let's say you're gonna have to be a real asshole to make me look good. (Laughs) It's what I do. - You're late. - Yes. Everybody, you're late. Don't let it happen again. I'm Tank, and I will be brief. Here at Airmeister, we have two rules. No refunds. The beauty of an air purifier is that nobody can prove that it doesn't work. - (Beep) - Amanda, you saucy tart. I want somebody really pissed off. I'm talking about Defcon 2 level of anger. Who do you got for me, baby? Amanda: I have just the one for you, Tank. She's furious and she asked for you by name. Put her through. Tank Turner, customer satisfaction. How may I help you? Alexis: Before we even discuss what I just received, which is a whole other mystery, I-I demand an explanation for yesterday. Ma'am, I'm fully concerned. What happened yesterday? Are you gay? Or are you just an asshole? Oh, ma'am. Profanity is superfluous, Because no verbal affront could be as devastating to me as your dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction? Yes, I mean, if the unit's performance or lack thereof, has left you frustrated-- See, I never saw your unit. I gave you your chance, And you didn't deliver. Ma'am, you're upset. I'm upset. I'm upset that you will never, ever know What it's like to sit on a hot, sweaty summer night, and let that unit blow its glorious bounty all over your face. Whoa. You think after the shit you put me through that-- that I-- I called just so you could talk dirty to me? I gave you a one-time free hall pass for sex. Good sex. Hot sex. I-- I-- I... Fucking roofied myself. (Gasps) I'm a little confused. Amanda? You're confused? That makes two of us, because I don't know what kind of asshole acts like an asshole, and then, when it actually comes time to be an asshole, walks away. Like a total asshole. Making me look like an even bigger asshole for offering some big-ass asshole asshole sex in the first place. What kind of asshole are you? (All laughing) This is actually a personal call. Dude, you are so hired. Excuse me for a second. (Girl laughing) Shit. Asshole. ♪ (The Cars' "My Best Friend's Girl" playing) ♪ Sorry. Offer expired. Oh, okay. Did you really think that roses and a poem would give you a second chance? You rhymed "apology" with "apologetically." I'm-- I just felt bad, okay? Because you're right, I do owe you an explanation. I didn't sleep with you because you're not attractive. There, I said it. Oh, thanks. Thank you so much, because you saved me from what could have possibly been the worst decision of my life. And I've eaten sushi in Tijuana. Ooh, 1-0, okay. You're below my standards. Even for a one-night pity fuck. And I've taken down some real hogs, Alexis. Yeah, hogs, cows, sheep. I bet your sex life is a regular heavy-petting zoo. You know what? You're what we call a two bagger. That means I have to wear a bag on my head just in case the one on yours breaks. You sure it's not just a size thing? 'Cause it's gotta be tough standing at a urinal, pissing on your own testicles. (Chuckles) Well, at least I can hide my shame in my pants. What really sucks is having an ass the size of a miniature Mediterranean donkey. That-- suck. - Don't-- - You think that's too big? Think that's too small? So you said do nothing, but I-I did something. Totally small. I sent her a couple hundred bucks worth of roses and a kick-ass poem. Short. Few stanzas. No big deal. Did she call? No. She didn't. Dusty, these women, they have a way of getting into our head, man. I'm gonna give you some fresh perspective. Listen to me, this girl-- I'm getting a hunch. She's built for destruction. You can't trust her. You know who you have to trust, Dusty? Each other. Yeah, it's time to let her go. Maybe get some-- you know. Just let her go, move on. You know? You want me to move on? Give up. You want me to give up? That's your big plan? I should just give up? (Chuckles) Well, that doesn't quite work for me, okay? That doesn't quite work for me. Look, I'm not some sort of, uh, misogynist that can just swap out women like they were batteries, okay? I love her, Tank. I care more about this girl than I do myself. And you will-- you will never understand that. It's new to me. She said she wants to be friends. Heh. You know what? I'll give her a friend.

If there's anything else I can get for you, I'm always available, professor. One of my teaching assistants, and a very, very hardworking young woman. (Door opens, closes) (Whispering) Last night, I fucked her within an inch of her life. True story. I'm jamming her head through the headboard. I flip her over, she screams, "Give me a choker." I play the choirboy. "what's that?" Star wipe to five minutes later, She's bucking like an epileptic at a strobe light convention. Now I'm getting scared. And as I'm working out the 911 phone call in my head, she goes, (Mimicking air escaping) (Normal voice) Like an air bag. Now, that's a Tuesday night. You got a good gig, dad. How you doing, son? Dusty kicked me out. In all fairness, I was accidentally sleeping with his pseudo-girlfriend, but, um... I feel like shit. Son, let me tell you a story. December, 1977, your mother, God rest her soul, throws one of her infamous pot potlucks, and I find myself sozzled in the boathouse with your Aunt Francie. Now, today, some might consider her to be zaftig, but back then, she could really hang a sundress. How I yearned for her. But I refrained... Because it was your mother's sister. I get it. I fucked up. No. No. The point is, is that two days later, I banged the shit out of her in the back of a Bonneville while your mother filled my prescription. Best Pontiac sex I've ever had. Okay, so you approve? (Chuckles) Guilt is just one more thing trying to asphyxiate us during sex. You cheat, you feel bad, you watch TV, you feel better... (Clicks) You cheat again. (Door closes) (Mouths words) All right, dad, you know what? This girl's different. All right? She's smart, she's cool. She's tough. She's a 10. Ms. Barber, I must apologize for my son's antiquated phraseology. Out of desperation, he continues to assess women a base-10 value number predicated solely on their physical countenance. That's, uh... - That's wrong, Sherman. - Ms. Barber: No problem. Yee-haw! (Humming) Get that dogie. (Laughs) Okay. (Mimicking searing sound) I moved away from the numbers a long time ago. Since you rarely find a 10 outside of L.A. And that's ass-up in polyurethane. You're really talking about a one through nine. It was too constricting. I'm all about the letters now. (Gasps) J. (Sniffs) She smells like a J. E over there in the booth. Ooh, ooh. Uh, an E is a, uh-- is a 22 on a scale of 26. It gets easier with practice. (Inhales) S. Crop top over here. She would be an F? Nah, bad skin. She's a G, maybe an H, without the war paint. But, uh, that cougar over there, Bo Derek, with the blue wrap, - she's a solid L. - Tank: Okay, wait a second. That woman is 62, that wrap is a shawl, that L is a Y. And there's a reason they call them Y's. - Come on. - Check it. Wow, good call, Sherm. Good call. - I've gotta get that lasik. - Hm. So, uh, you gonna wing me or what? (Sighs) What's the game plan? Well, being an educator, I like to stick to the school grades... A, B, C and D. You, on the other hand, should... stay with the back 13, thin out the herd. Thanks, dad. I'm off the market right now. I told you about this girl. You know, she-- uh... The other night we're making love, and, uh, we're just laying there afterwards, and-- - Sharing the silence? - Yeah. (Chuckles) - What the fuck is wrong with you? - What? "Making love?" What are you, Nora Ephron? Is this some Redbook interview? You sound like Liberace’s stylist's boyfriend. "Let's just enjoy the silences and the caprice together." - I have no son. I have no son. - Dad. I dig this girl. Good, keep talking. And while you're talking, there are cougars on my right who are clocking us. - In real time. - Can you just listen? As soon as you put on your safari hat and grab your gun. Dad, can you just stay here with me, please? Of course I can, son. Since you just fucked my chances with the "dad" play. Thanks for projecting. Not to mention the gay-grip-caress maneuver for the hearing-impaired. Can't you just be my dad for five fucking seconds? Oh, I'm sorry. You want the real father-son bullshit. Right this way. That girl was dating Dusty, which means she's out of your league. She was slumming it, Sherman. "Now, the truth may set you free, but first it's gonna piss you off." Gloria Steinem said that. (Cell phone vibrates) My son, the booty call. Thanks for the advice... Professor. (Tank grunting softly) Oh. Shit. (Chuckles) (Alexis moans) (Tank sighs) (Sighs) (Whispers) That was insane. (Chuckles) (Sighs) (Normal voice) It was insane, right? (Sniffles) It was... (Sighs) Hey, yeah, can I have some of that? (Sighs) Who's that guy? Alexis: That's Greg. He's an old friend. (Sighs) Why? Just I'm seeing, you know, his arm's a little low on your hip. One of his hands, almost near your ass. You know, for a friend. - Did you guys ever hook up? - (Giggles) - Really? - You're not serious, are you? No. No, I'm not serious at all. I mean, you're in a picture with him. Oh, my God, you're serious. Wait, w-- Why don't we have a picture? I... I don't know. (Groans) Um... - I can fix that. - No, no, no, no, no. That's easy. No, no. I'm naked.
