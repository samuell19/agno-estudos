No, I know, I forgot. I should have done it last night. I didn't finish Sunday. I didn't get back till late. I'll sort it out as soon as I get in. I promise you, as soon as I get it. No, I promise you, mate. Okay. All right, I'm literally around the corner now. Where are you? Around the corner, give me two seconds. Hurry Up. Hurry Up. All right, ta'ra, ta'ra, ta'ra Hi, you've reached Kelly. Leave me a message. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Bye. Oh, Kelly I'm real sorry I missed it. I've just had so much shit on. Do you know what I mean? I'm... I'm devastated, and I'm really, really, really sorry. I can't fucking believe it. I, me head was all over the place. You know what I mean? Ah, fuck. Just tell him I'm so sorry, and I'll, I'll phone him before he goes to bed, yeah? But please, please tell him I'm really, really, really fucking sorry. I don't, I... I've... I've... I've just got so much going on. Do you know what I mean? I've been living out of a suitcase for the past two fucking months. Only moved in last night. So, you know, it's not... I know it's my fault, but just tell him I'll tell him I'll phone him before he goes to bed. Okay? All right. Sorry. Ta'ra, bye. - Morning, Chef. - Fair enough. - Chef's coffee Chef? - Yeah. Double, Bill. - Sorry, Mr. Jones? - Yeah? I'm Alan Lovejoy, I'm the environmental health... Nice to meet you. Are you okay to crack on? Yeah. Just give me a couple of minutes. Yeah? - All right. - I'll be right back. As soon as you're ready, please. - Let me get changed. - Thank you. All right, Carly, should we just finish up? We can recap a couple of things while we're waiting for him. - Okay. - That one's off. You've already said Toby? - Tony. - Tony. We're going to get this in order before we open, yeah? Of course. Not tomorrow? Okay, don't let Andy see you. Yeah. Clean this shit up before Andy gets here. - Sorry did you just- - No, just do it. Just wash your hands in the food preparation sink? - Yes. - Yeah. You're aware we wash our hands in the, in the hand washing sink over there? - No, I uh... - She's new. - What's your name? - Camille. Camille. How long have you been here, Camille? - A week or so. - Okay. Have you been on any food hygiene courses, accreditation at all? Yeah. No. She's got a level two. She's got a level two? Okay. Well, if you could show me that before I leave? - Yeah. Absolutely. - That would be brilliant. Camille, I'm glad you're washing your hands, just not where we prepare food. Okay? I'm sure you knew that though. - Just... - Okay. I know. I know. All right, so we set them fridges, And that is... that's just about regulation. Which of course is? - Eight degrees. - Eight degrees. But ideally, like the ones around there I prefer it to be a bit lower in the region of five would be ideal. But eight degrees is regulation? - Eight degrees is regulation. - So we meet regulation? - You do meet regulation. - Great. But no, no, but what I'm saying is if you packed that fridge anymore, the circulation of the air is not gonna be able to get around and you're gonna have to waste a load more food. Okay? Because it's going to go above eight degrees. So always err on the side of caution, Carly. Like Mr. Lewis said, the other inspector don't risk it for a biscuit. That's what we try and say. Sorry. Hello? Hello? All right, it's all right... Do you want to put the knife down a second? - Yes, sorry. - Thank you. Let's have a quick word, just talk me through what you're doing. Well, we're prepping duck for this evening. Prepping duck. Okay, and how would you do that? Well, do what I'm doing now, and then we pan fry it and put it in the oven. At what temperature would you cook the duck to? - 63 degrees. - 63. And you check that how? - With a probe. - With a probe. - And you do that regularly? - Every meal. - And you keep checks. - Yep. Lovely. Thank you. The tiles, you said the structural damage? Yeah, contractors coming tomorrow. Coming tomorrow, and as soon as you take a picture of that you can actually email that to me. Keeps itching his beard, do you know that? It's fine he washes his hands. It's fine. Okay. Well, as long as he does regularly. Thank you. Yeah, you could email me that as soon as you've got- - Yeah. Yeah. - Would you? Emily? Emily? This is our head of pastry, Emily and this is our commie pastry chef, Jamie. Jamie, nice to meet you. We actually have- - I was going to say, I recognize your face. We have met before. Your bakery in Hoxton. - Rolly Pollies. - Rolly Pollies! - Yes, you remember. - Yes, absolutely. Your banana, your banana cake had this- - Thank you very much. - Dark chocolate. - Yes. - It's beautiful isn't it? - Have you tried it, Jamie? - Oh, I love it. - He's had it a few times. - Out of this world. - How are you? - I'm not too bad thank you. - You good? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You look really, really well. - Come now. No, now please. No not too bad I'm not surprised- - Emily. Emily. - Yes, darling? - You all right? - Yeah, we're fine. I'm not surprised this is all an order - with you working here. - Bless you. I've been round about half hour ago - and it's all tipped off. - All good? Jamie. Jamie, how long have you been there? About three weeks. Excuse me mate, how long is this gonna take? Well, it will take as long as it takes. And I appreciate that, but we've got to open up, Well, I know that. We are actually about done, I'm waiting for you. Can we just have a quick word? All right if we go out there? Yeah, course, yeah. Just you and me. All right. Emily. Its lovely, lovely to see you. - It was really love- - Have a lovely Christmas. And yourself. Jamie. Good to meet you. Okay. I don't want to keep you any longer than we have to. Just take a seat. Thank you. Okay. So let's see what we're dealing with here. - Okay. - All right. Sorry. Primarily, that's all the information you need to know. I'm not going to go through with you all today, because we're running a bit behind. But it's all there, Carly knows it all. And, that's your sticker. You've gone down from a five to a three. All right? I'm going to tell you why. - That's a big drop, init? - It is. It's primarily because of your... your documentation. Okay? And your record keeping. - And it's quite frankly- - Wash basin? Wash basin. It's the French... - Camille? French lady? - Yeah? She's washing her hands in the food preparation sink, but that's not the main thing I'm concerned about. The main thing I'm concerned about, is that, could I... could I have your attention? The main thing I'm concerned about is this, okay. You've got big gaps here. Massive gaps, where we should be filling in daily. Taking... taking... taking fridge temperatures. I'm assured they're done every day. - But if we come... - What's with the oysters? The oysters over there, his sections a mess. Okay. I just walked passed him and he's still not cleaned it up. It' his gloves, he's without gloves on cross-contamination the lot, I don't need to tell you that. Okay. You'll need to replace that knife. So what is obvious to me is there's lots of gaps up until two months ago is filled in quite regularly. Now we've got gaps. Look at where it should be filled in. And the opening and closing checks, someone who's meant to do them. - Yeah. That's me. - Yourself. Yourself. Okay. Well, if you're not able to do it someone should come in, and you should have that in place for someone to do it. These are basic things, Mr. Jones, and it's going to bring your score down. It keeps, can I have your attention? As soon as we get this done I can leave. And the sooner we get this done, the sooner we can move on and get you back up to where you should be. Before this, which was a five. But your confidence in management has gone right down, because of this. All right? This should be like an idiot's guide. So if you're off, if Carly's off. For some reason, anyone could pick this up and can make this place run smoothly safely, effectively. I know it's a pain in the arse, but it's a necessary pain in the arse. Okay. So let's leave it there. Okay. So, you can appeal. I wouldn't advise that. I'd say it'd be a waste of the time in your case, but the bottom here is my email. Okay? A. Lovejoy. Three months' time, you get in contact with me and we'll get you back up to a five, if you follow this criteria, all right? But you're going to need to get this in order. Oh, one last thing. No glass in the kitchen, but you knew that. All right? Have a good Christmas. All the best. Beth, Beth can I have a quick word? Yes, yes, of course. How was it? Emily. Jamie. Yeah. Yes. Have a look at that. What's that say? Oh dear, it says a three. - Sorry? - It says a three. Three, that's fucking massive. That's, I mean that's a jump and a half, init? We were a five and now we're a three. What he comes down, has a nose about and that's it, we're a three? It's a fucking joke. Init? How do wash your hands, love? - I know. - Sorry what? In the sink. - In the sink. Which sink? - All right, Andy. - Back there. - Which sink? - Hang on Carly. - No, no, no she's been... Carly, wait a minute, love. Carly, Carly this is fucking basic GCSE fucking- - Yeah, and it's her first week, so it's my responsibility. It's not her first week in any fucking kitchen though, is it? You've worked in kitchens before haven't ya? - Yes. - Yeah, that's why you're here. You've worked in kitchens before, yeah? - Yes. - Yes what? - Yes Chef. - Yes Chef. - So what's that sink for, kid? - Food. - For what? - Food. What do you not do in that sink? - Wash your hands. - Wash your what? - Hands. - Wash your hands. Yeah. Fucking gobshite here. You, using the wrong fucking sink, and you, soft ass, what are you playing at? What do you mean, Chef? What do we mean, what do I mean? What the fuck are you doing? I'm not, I'm not supposed to be on a section chef. Tony, how long have you worked here, lad? I've been here, no, but it's Hobbs... Tony. Tony, how long have you worked here, son? - A year. - A year. He's saying you've got no fucking gloves on. Cross contamination with the oysters. - I got, Chef, sorry. - Put your fucking gloves on. - Sorry. - Put your gloves on, son. Now, listen, Tony, you buck your fucking ideas up, lad, cause there's a million kids out there who would die for this fucking opportunity that you've been given. Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef Show some fucking respect. Respects your fucking self. Pull your fucking socks up. - Sorry Chef. - Yes. Right, look, every single one of yous, that goes for all yous.

Table seven said the lamb is under cooked. What? They want it to be cooked again. No that's fine, it's pink, it's supposed to be pink. I did try and explain that to them... - What's the problem? - Did you explain it to them? - I did. I actually did. - What's the problem? - What table? - Seven. Okay well they didn't ask for it well done. That's lamb, darling, that's how it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be pink. Yeah, I know, I did explain that to them, they still didn't listen to me. - Okay, what table is it? - Seven. Let me go and fucking explain it to them. - Whoa whoa whoa whoa. - Leave it, leave it, leave it. Just fry the shit out of it. Grill the arse off it. That's how it's supposed to be cooked. Turn it into fucking charcoal, lower your voice. Explain next time please. Yes, yes, I will. For fuck's sake. Why was that plate sent back? - It's fine, we've sorted it. - Well, what's the problem? - There is no problem. - Well, what's the problem? Why has it been sent back? I'm asking what the problem was. They said it was too pink. Right, so the customer wasn't happy? That's what the problem was? No, no, the problem wasn't that. The problem was your staff isn't explaining... So it's my staffs problem. 'Cause if it is that, They've sent the plate back, because they're not happy with the food. It's quite simple. The lamb is supposed to be pink. Do you understand that the lamb is supposed to be pink? It's not my staff' s issue, it's not about that. Do you understand that the lamb is suppose- - I'm saying the customer's always right. Look, look, look, look do you know how the dish is supposed to be? - Girls, girls, girls. - No, no, no. Do you know how the dish is supposed to be cooked? Do you? Because what keeps happening, is that plates keep getting sent back because you're not fucking training your staff properly. - That's not my, that not- - Yes, it is. We are working our fucking arses off here and you. You know what, Andy? I'm sick to the back teeth of your fuckups being blamed on us Look how hard everyone's working here. Look how hard everyone is working to earn you money, but you keep... You just haven't got a fucking clue. We run off our arses here, because you hold the book. But you're so fucking stupid that you don't even know that you've done it do ya? Okay. Do you realize that you have overbooked? - Carly. - No? No? And on top of that, she's asking us to go off menu, to cook fucking steak for some bullshit influencers. And never put the allergies on the system, so were having to refer to your scrawny handwritten fucking note all night. Do you know how much pressure we're under? You know maybe, maybe, maybe... Okay maybe, if you spent half as much time learning how to run a restaurant instead of whoring your arse on social media like a budget fucking Kardashian, then we wouldn't be so much in the shit that we are now. You talk to us all, like we are the dirt on the bottom of your fucking shoe. Well I'll tell you something, love, I've had enough of it. I do not fucking like you. They don't like you. Nobody likes you. And this job is not worth it. I do not get paid enough to deal with this shit. I don't get paid enough, do you hear me? Even with the wage increase. So you better adjust your attitude love. What wage increase? Girls, girls, come on, not right now. What? Leave it. Leave it. It's okay. - What? - Leave it. She talks to me like that again, she's gone. Okay. Listen, listen, listen. Dad, could call me back when you get this please? I don't, I don't think I'm meant to be doing this. I don't really know what I'm doing, and no one really likes me here. Can you just call me back please? Are you okay? Yeah, fine. Why? We had two walk-ins at front desk. - Okay. - I just wanted to get... Maybe you could let me do my work. - I'll try. - Okay. Hi, guys, here's the extra bottle. Should I just swap, switch it out. Yeah switch it out, switch it out that's great. Also, could I get like a ramekin dish with some zatar. Oh, yeah, sure absolutely. This is so good but it just needs a little, You know? Yeah no worries at all. I'll get that now. - Thank you. Thank you. - Zatar? I mean, you can't turn off the chef for just, just one night? Hmm listen, this is great, it's 98 percent there. What's missing? Two percent, two percent. Ah, you're funny. You know Andy always needed me to push him to greatness. Never, never ever achieved it on his own, but he will. I'm sure, I mean I like it. Not everything has to have liquid nitrogen, or rubble of nuts, or, you know? Yeah, humor me okay? Just... We have the same thing. Just, tell me what I'm tasting? Come on. It's unpretentious. It doesn't complicate itself. It's lovely, its simple. It's what? - It's simple. - Simple. So we're talking about unpretentious, simple food and paper menus. What are you trying to do here? Do you want me to give them a bad review or what? That's my friend. He's my friend. Okay I don't want you to give him a bad review. I just wanted you to be honest about what we're eating. Okay, good, because I quite like it. And reviewing is like sex, you go by what's there, not by what's not there. You know. Just eat your food. Elvis, you have left the kitchen, so let's just enjoy what is here. Here is the zatar. Now watch. - Oh, amazing. - Right? Don't, don't, don't egg him on. You don't have to put it on mine.

Maybe he gives you a ride home tonight. - Yeah maybe. - All right, cool. - I'll ask him actually. - That's no problem. Pst, what's Alistair Skye like? I was just saying that he was really charming. Oh you fancy him. Oh, Billy, you're the one she loves though. Oh really? It doesn't seem that way. Do not say that. It's all right, I've got him tonight. That's embarrassing. How about the Americans, actually, are they going? All right, here's your cremated lamb. Andrea, I wasn't having a go at you. Please, just them just tell them that's not how it's supposed to be cooked. I'll pass the message on. Here's your lamb, sir. What's that? It's the lamb that we've- - Not that. That? If you want I can take it back. No, get your dirty fingerprints of me plate. The kitchen did want me to let you know that, usually lamb should be cooked pink, but just for you we cooked it extra well done. - Yes, I know that. - I hope you enjoy your meal.

You know, the way to not burn out? You know the way to achieve a successful restaurant? Is confidence and a great team, right, Chef? You can have a very mediocre chef, surrounded by a great team and you've got a successful restaurant. Or you can have a shit chef surrounded by a great team. Well, good for you two. I think men have an easier time of it. You know what your fault is? The trouble is you made one mistake in your life, and that was marrying the man you married. Well, I didn't exactly think I was marrying a selfish, self-obsessed, pretentious, narcissist. You married a narcissist? Now who falls in love and marries a narcissist?

I'm just checking up now. - She okay? - She must be so hurt. Excuse me, excuse me, you had one job. One fucking job. Look what you've done to my girlfriend. - No, we're really sorry. - No, this is a shambles. You ruined everything. Calm down. Calm down. Do you have a like a blanket or a jacket or something, because my jumper's in there. I think she's having an allergic reaction. - Nobody told me this. - She's allergic to nuts.

I have no idea. I don't, I don't know. - Who cooked the meal? - It would have been- - Who's the sous chef? No, it would've been Freeman, Carly would have sent it out. Listen, Carly has got to take the bullet for this, okay, cause otherwise you will, okay? This is your restaurant, this is my money, okay? - You have to put Carly on it. - I'm not doing that. - Why? - It's not Carly's fault. It doesn't matter whose fault it is. Fault leaves with her in this ambulance, all right. You got to do this. You've got to make the right decision. You've got to make it right now. You've got to do it, okay?
