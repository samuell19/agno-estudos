[birds squawking] [another gunshot] 'Machaan... dude?' Come... come da' Come on! [gunshot] 'Breaking News!' 'Two youngsters were gunned down in Ooty early this morning near Lovedale forest...' '...by an unidentified female assassin.' 'Video posted online of this tragedy has struck panic amongst the general public.' 'This was recorded by a foreign tourist who happened to be at the crime spot.' 'The motive behind this murder has come to light with the aid of this video.' She tried to kidnap a 10 year old girl at gunpoint When they tried to save the child this shootout happened. A direct witness on the spot is a tea stall owner named Ramar. To monitor the movement of elephants in that area... ...the forest department fixed this CCTV camera. You can watch the footage recorded in that camera. 'Infiltration of kidnappers in Tamil Nadu?' 'Murderer's composite sketch divulged by the police.' 'Innocent youngsters shot dead while saving a child held hostage.' 'Kidnapping continues.' To nab the culprit...' Rampant checking on Tamil Nadu-Kerala border.' [various News headlines] 'Increase in cases of missing children in Ooty.' 'People are showing their dissent in many areas.' Parents of the missing child and the general public are gathered here. [shouting anti-slogans] My daughter went to school and now she is missing. Sir we are waiting for your update. -Where has she taken my child? -Silence please! Please wait! Be calm. We understand your plight. Please be patient. What do you mean 'be patient'? She has killed two youngsters and kidnapped a child with ease. Will you be 'patient' if she was your child? We have no idea if that child is still alive! The number of missing children in Ooty has increased drastically in the past month. What action have you taken? We will continue to protest till every single child is traced. We will protest! Show our dissent.' We will protest unto death!' Until our very last breath.' Clear this place now.' Headlines!' The police shot dead the kidnapper in an encounter this morning.' Name of that kidnapper is Jothi.' Using the lead she was escaping by Jaipur Express from Tiruppur to Rajasthan.' We arrested Jothi at the railway station in Tiruppur...' ...but the child she had taken hostage was not in her custody.' 'When we interrogated her she claimed to have hidden the child in Lovedale.' When we went with her to the specified venue...' ...the child's face and limbs were mutated beyond recognition.' 'When our team was recovering the body...' ...she shot us with a crude country gun that she had already concealed there.' We were forced to retaliate and shoot her.' She confessed to her crimes of kidnapping the child...' ...and killing the two youngsters who rushed to the child's rescue.' Jothi the kidnapper stayed in this house in Anger Board for a few months.' This is the latest information that has come to light.' Sir who is Jothi? What is her motive?' Why should she kidnap and kill children?' Jothi is a North Indian.' She hails from Jaipur.' She is a psycho killer.' She has been accused of kidnapping in Jaipur too.' We obtained this information from our initial interrogation.' She has been staying here for the past few months...' ...where she kidnapped, tortured and killed many children.' We suspect the child that was with her had also been kidnapped by her.' Why have any doubt sir?' That child is from the north sir. I was sweeping the porch when the children were playing outside.' My son offered her a candy.' That kidnapper came rushing out and hit that child mercilessly. In fact I asked her why she was so violent? She spoke in some strange language I couldn't understand and walked away. I saw her hit the child and drag her away. Officials have recovered many weapons and blood stained dresses from this house.' Sniffer dogs are being used to dig the backyard of Jothi's house.' Hey! Dig here. Move aside sir. [anguished wails] You waved bye-bye my dear and went to school, so full of life. Now you have been found lifeless.' Oh God! How will I live without you?' Allow me to see my daughter.' Move aside! My darling daughter Get up and hug me.' What will I do now?' [agonized wail] Oh! Kavitha.' They are taking my child away in front of my eyes.' Oh God! How many years I prayed to have this child!' How will I live without you? 'Ponmagal Vandhal.' 'Precious Girl Arrived' -Sir how long to wait? -I'm on the phone right? -They want the case files. -That isn't a girl's voice dear. -Happily flirting! -I am hungry sir. As if you've been working nonstop! Type without typos. -Somehow put my mother-in-law behind bars. -Consider it done. Can you afford to spend? -Yes sir. -Then nothing to worry. [clearing throat] Lord Ganesha, don't assign any terrorist case for me. Clean India! You are the epitome of poetry Kalidasan and Kannadasan's creativity. Wow! Clean India. Even the name is super bro. Bro, two cups of tea for us please. I was looking for you over there. God! Make it three cups! -Let's go in. -Hello, lawyer sir. Looks like you'll push our bro here behind bars! You've been dragging him for days when this case is a piece of cake! And he has been tugging me along. Is it Petition Pethuraj case? Yes how do you know? You looked surprised when you saw my shop and me right? Yes! He is the main culprit you know. Your tea sir. He came to drink a glass of tea worth just Rs 10. And I had to shell out 10,000 bucks! You shouldn't brush off a fly with a wave of your hand, aunt! -She isn't your aunt! -Sorry, Your Honour. Flies and mosquitoes are the main breeders... ...of new diseases spreading all over our country. -You continue. -Yes, aunt. Awww... sorry! Yes, Your Honour. Fly falling into his tea is the crime of the century! -At least defend me for fleecing me! -Wait man. Your Honour, if a fly fell into his tea it is the fault of the fly How can the shopkeeper be held responsible? In all fairness, the case should be filed against the fly. Only because such ordinary cases are being underlined... ...our whole nation is in tatters like a cheap underwear with holes. -Yuck! -Look, Your Honour. Instead of highlighting legal loopholes he is pinpointing holes in an underwear! His shop's hygiene is questionable and he is finding faults with a fly! Forget the fly! You come from an orthodox background. He is the one supplying tea even for you. Give it some serious thought. Imagine instead of a fly if your tea had a lizard swimming in it... ...and you swallowed it by mistake! What is the end result aunt? Not only did he press the panic button in the judge's mind... ...he fixed this banner and made me join 'Swachh Bharat' party! We seem to be better-off then. -Is that man truly jobless? -That is his only job! He and his daughter paint the town maroon. Don't even ask. What is this new avatar my dear? What happened? Forgot to fill gas as usual huh? It's okay don't fret. You didn't miss clicking snaps I hope? One track mind on your job as always! Thanks my dear. With the mighty Petition Pethuraj around... ...how can he pilfer groceries from a government shop? I won't let you go scot-free. -What? -They are still following us. Let's go pa. Did your father will this world to you? For you to kick and abuse undue! There are others in this world like you. Nurture them to live happily too! Play with flowers, cherish Mother Nature... Chat with the wind's poems in rapture. With hope in very step, await happy hours. Dance in the rain our green earth showers. Life will change again for the better. A day will dawn with fragrance in the air. All the seeds have to go up instead. There's no other path here to tread. Wow! Biscuit. Venba... Why are you over reacting? Like a comforter for children innocent, flowers enclosed snugly in a blanket. River winding down the mountain as refreshing perspiration. Housing many a life readily without complaining daily. Is the mountain a woman universally? Venba what did you teach my son? When my mother-in-law bathes him he yells out 'Grandma that's bad-touch'! If she catches me talking to you... Womanliness yearns for kinship. Lives each day forging friendship. A mother's heart is selfless to the hilt... Her unconditional love has no limit! Even if lying on the funeral pyre lifeless she turns into a lamp to spread brightness! For you to live in happiness. Sub inspector Suresh Pandian nabs chain snatcher, March 2004.' A bud will blossom on earth, selfless. Setting you above everything else! Trust in yourself with a positive halo. Then the world will guard you tomorrow. You had no time to listen to life as a child's prattle without strife! I can't hear you. Sub inspector Suresh! You were drowning in tears of sorrow No one cared about your tomorrow. Life will change again for the better. A day will dawn with fragrance in the air! All the seeds have to go up instead. There is no other path here to tread! -'Vanakkam' sir. -Forget niceties. -Where is your boss? -He has gone for a party meeting. Make a decent cup of tea for me. I'll call you after I reach Chennai dear. Sub inspector Suresh Pandian nabs chain snatcher, March 2004.' Where the hell did you vanish for a whole week? Even your daughter was wishy washy with her replies. Didn't I tell you we have a hearing you can't miss? If we had wrapped up this case yesterday we would have made a whopping 30000! Cool... cool. I had to go to Chennai regarding a very important case. Hereafter, for your information, I intend handling only that case. These chicken feed cases are all yours. See you. Waitees! How can any case be important without me? I am going in now just for that. Follow me and find out for yourself! What's up with him? -Next! -SC #1352 Petitioner Petition Pethuraj! Good morning. Kidnapping and brutal killing of five children in Ooty on May 2004. Jothi's case!' Did I hear it right? After the investigation, the High Court of Chennai has directed... ...the case for trial in District Sessions court, Ooty. Advocate defending this case is Venba Pethuraj. What? Venba huh?' Have you lost your mind? You were pottering around for publicity all along. I was defending your cases for want of nothing else to do. How can you screw up so bad? Tomorrow parents whose children were kidnapped will queue up in court. How will you be able to look them in their eyes? How disgusting! It's a sin to work for people like you! The hearing is fixed for 23rd of this month. Hey Pethuraj! Planning to hit the jackpot?' She killed innocent children mercilessly. At the time of those killings... ...even the boldest of men who could brave the Ooty cold, shivered in fear. You want to defend such a heartless female. Don't you think this is height of injustice? If a dog barks it doesn't mean every visitor to your house is a thief. What weird logic! Intense relief operations have begun in areas affected by Gaja cyclone.' Varadarajan, a renowned philanthropist in Coimbatore...' ...CEO and trustee of Rohith Companies,' ...met the chief minister of Tamil Nadu,' ...and donated a relief fund to the tune of 10 million.' One crore! -I went along with him. -I know. Psycho Jothi's case that created terror and trauma in Ooty 18 years ago...' ...has been relisted for trial in the District Sessions Court in Ooty.' Girl children were kidnapped and killed brutally in 2004 in Ooty.' Jothi, a North Indian assassin, was killed by the police in an encounter.' Two innocent lads were killed by Jothi.' Sir is coming. -Good morning. -They want financial aid sir. -Good morning sir. -Vanakkam sir. Find out what they want and do the needful. Okay sir! -You must focus only on your studies. -Okay sir. -If you need anything else ask me. -We are indebted to you sir. You can leave now. Bring it here. Jothi's case has been reopened for interrogation after 15 years.' What is your opinion?' She was punished for her heinous crimes. This is sheer publicity for selfish gains. If questioned, they will justify it as their basic right in a democratic nation. Picking up a controversy for his daughter's debut. He has planned it to gain publicity. Don't know how many more lawyers will turn into liars defending murderers? All India Democratic Women's Association!' 'We object to this injustice.' -VENBA! -Down! Down! [shouting anti-slogans] Madam, why have you reopened a 15 year old case? -'Do you know about this case? -She is a heartless killer.' How can you take up that case?' Is it to gain publicity for your debut case?' Why don't you answer madam? She strangled children ruthlessly. Is it necessary to reopen this case? -Venba! -Down! Down!' [shouting slogans] -Venba! -Down! Down! How can you walk with only one slipper? SC #1352 Are the petitioner and his advocate here, along with the documents as per High Court order? I'll get really irritated if you start at 10 and ask for adjournment at 10:30. Venba, you can proceed. Thank you, Your Honour. The hatred and anger I see flashing in the faces of the people assembled here... ...I can very well understand. I'm also aware of the sensitivity of this case. Every case requires lawful arguments and proper witnesses. If absolute truth is needed... ...mostly the answer is no. Few years ago,' ...a girl was raped and killed in Assam. Police nabbed a person with undue haste claiming to possess proper evidence. While he was being interrogated in the police station... ...having watched the News of the criminal being apprehended, ...around 500 people barged into the station. They dragged him to the road and beat him to death! Claiming the murdered girl got justice, media provided news running to pages! But that poor man was present only on the day of the incident. He and the rape victim had nothing to do with each other... ...which was later proved in an enquiry commission. One minute... Which case are you comparing with the current one? Was this case closed on a rush of emotion? It was closed 15 years ago after proper inquiry by the police. I don't know why Petition Pethuraj has reopened this case! Everyone knows 'psycho' Jothi... Sir that's the term used in the News! Addressing her as 'psycho' Jothi and that too you doing so, is a breach of law. High Court has investigated this case properly and directed it here. If you question... Contempt of court! That means you are dishonoring the court of law. Sir, sit down. Let her finish. In cases where we get very emotional... ...sometimes grave mistakes like this happen quite often. Such hidden truths are rampant in this case too. I humbly request you to let me enquire into this in a proper manner Your Honour. Proceed. I would like to interrogate Ramar, an important eye witness in this case. Good morning, sir. Mr Ramar... Aren't you the only eye witness of that unfortunate incident? Yes madam. What were you doing there at that specific time? I was praying. I swear madam. My tea shop is next to the crime scene. I opened the shop and I was praying. Do you remember the events that unfolded? I remember it crystal clear as if it happened only today! That morning I opened the shop earlier than usual.' Early morning... blue sky!' It was bitterly cold.' The road was covered by a cloud of mist.' So it was quite deserted.' Then I heard a child screaming, 'Let me go' some distance away.' I went in the direction of the scream.' I saw a woman dragging that child by force.' That's when those two youngsters got down from a car.' Hearing that child's scream they tried to rescue her.' Suddenly that woman fished out her gun.' I was completely rattled.' Shell shocked, both those lads ran!' She shot one of them.' The other lad tried to escape by scrambling into the car.' She shot him too inside the car.' As soon as I saw the twin murders, my stomach literally somersaulted.' Shaking from head to toe, I hid behind a tree.' Thank God! The dense mist blurred her vision. You are repeating shot by shot what is shot in that video Ramar. No madam! Whatever I witnessed in person... ...is what you saw in the video. Even now when I think of that incident... ...it sends shivers down my spine! Okay! Forget that Ramar. People call you by some other name? The reason behind that... I'm a staunch follower of Ma Vi Ka Ramamurthy anna. You can say I am his right hand! That's why I'm fondly called 'All-in-all Ramar' by everyone. That's the name of my shop too! -Are you so fond of him? -Of course! Look I've tattooed his name. It seems you have many photos of both of you in your shop. I won't miss a single birthday of his. I'll somehow go in search of him and click a picture with him. Every single birthday photo you can see in my shop. But I missed his birthday in 2004. I didn't even ask you. Why are you volunteering this piece of news? No, just as information. Your Honour, every single year without fail... ...this 'All-in-all' Ramar, who clicks a photo with his leader, ...has missed out only in 2004. Why? Objection Your Honour! This is an unwarranted question. Maybe he was held up somewhere else? She is questioning him without any basis! It is basic and essential sir. Objection overruled! On May 5th, 2004... ...the birthday of the leader of People's Freedom Party, Mr Ramamurthy, ...was celebrated in Chennai. Since it was his leader's birthday, as usual Ramar stuck to his annual custom. This is the photo!' The same hangs in his shop too.' On May 5th, 2004... ...you witnessed twin murders and a kidnapping. Shell shocked you went home and huddled into your bed. How could you have taken a photo in an event in Chennai? Your Honour... She has brought some old paper cutting and speaking quite incoherently. Prosecutor sir... The witness himself is silent. No madam. The thing is... Nothing Ramar. Because you lied through your teeth! You weren't an eye witness at the crime spot. You didn't see anything. Your Honour, only a short while ago... ...Ramar claimed Jothi wasn't able to see him through the heavy mist. But how could Ramar have seen Jothi through that same thick mist? Instead of 1000 evidences providing proof ...being present at the crime spot and turning up as eye witness in court... ...is very important. But in this case, ...even that witness is a false witness! There has been many such discrepancies in Jothi's case. Police didn't interrogate the witnesses or investigate the evidence in this case. They just created them! My next question... Jothi fired at the policemen with the country-made gun in her possession. She tried to escape and was therefore killed in a police encounter! Alright the fact she had a country gun is mentioned only in the FIR papers. The police did not furnish the details of the gun. So I need to interrogate the police team which handled this case Your Honour. Your Honour, we need time to collect details of the objects used in this case. What is this sir? Giving excuses like a school kid! When you appear in a criminal case like this... ...don't you have to collect the corresponding details? In the next hearing you must submit all the details pertaining to this pistol. All the concerned police officials should be present in the next hearing! Okay sir. Who thought a 15 year old case will be raked up now?' Next hearing is on the third.' The court is adjourned!' My golden moon, true blue. My dreams dazzle around you. Comfort soothing my mind anew, Embracing me day and night too. [humming a song from 'Moodu Pani'] -Fish fry? -Yes sir! Have you made it extra-spicy? Very good... very good! I'll be back now. Why do you look so shocked da? Hey! How many times have I told you not to guzzle down booze like a bloated buffalo? What can I do da? In this cold weather the moment I saw it... ...my hands involuntarily downed the glass. You are incorrigible da. Cheers! Karpooram, if not for this whiskey and you... ...I would have been a judge all my life. Got fed up and went to my grave! Right from our school days you love wallowing in self pity. What is lacking in your life now? You are the judge for this Government! Don't add fuel to the fire. I've fixed my daughter's wedding in one month from now. As the gap for the due date lessens, my finances are dwindling too. At this point in time such a case crops up! I thought only cash crunch is a problem. Even this case is complicated! Wanting to be an honest judge, you didn't get lured by deals. You don't know how to have your palms greased on the sly either. If you stick to your principles, how will your family respect you? Don't be silly! One day you'll understand the true value of being honest! Okay dude I'm going home huh? Hey! Wait! You may trip and fall in some ditch. Then who will face your wife's fury? Felicitating advocate Rajarathinam for 10 years of name, fame and more to come!' Sir, Mr. Varadarajan has arrived.' -Hi sir. Welcome! -Vanakkam. Such a pleasant surprise. It is only appropriate to come and wish in person for such milestones. Thank you! Why do you seem so dull sir? Though I'm blessed with everything, ...I feel empty as if I have nothing. All this authority and affluence, ...what is the point of being so blessed? My wife has passed away. My son who was my world, has joined her too. I forced myself to move on in life. I thought I'll help people to the best of my ability till I die. I have a new entrant shattering my peace. This case... Are you disturbed because of this case? -Rathinam! -Sir? I need to talk to you alone. Sure! Rathinam! I'm not used to asking anyone any favor... Here sir. You must finish this deal for me. What is this sir? Go home, take rest... I'll take care. Thank you. Go to Mr. Varadarajan's office tomorrow. Collect the files related to this case. Send me the phone number of Alexander who is handling this case. -Why are you looking at me weirdly? -I haven't seen you so submissive! We have more important cases than this. -That's why... -Listen! We can depose people in power. But we should never oppose those who create power for personal gain. He didn't come begging me to bag this case. He insisted I'm the only one who can handle it. If I'm more than willing... ...it means we will hit the jackpot in this case! Like this! Golden opportunity! Shameless Shylock court owner! Pay and then help yourself to a bun.' I am a land owner of repute. And you treat me like a lazy lout! First, let me win this case. I'll evict you! Then I'll eliminate this court. -Vanakkam sir. -Hello uncle. Greetings! -Sir tea? -Forget the tea! What is this 'fly master'? As usual court owner is creating a scene claiming this land belongs to him? Hit the nail on the head! Please be my guest. Listen to me Zameen... Our entire nation is dependent on the court. From cow-catching case to convicting liquor barons. Celebrity or nonentity, he or she has to come here. That being the case, ...if you roam around threatening to evict the court or evacuate our airport... ...I'll submit a petition claiming to be one of the heirs of this land. In the psycho Jothi's case which has created quite a stir,' ...private audio of Public Prosecutor in Ooty was leaked online.' And he has been dismissed from his post.' District collector has replaced him with the renowned lawyer,' Rajarathinam from the Chennai High court.' Hammer nailing your head huh? My mind is so disturbed pa. Is it because Rajarathinam will be handling this case? No pa. People in high posts are shuffled like a pack of cards. Only because they are loaded with money and might, right? We got into this case with our eyes wide open. We dived in with good faith. We can face it! But bear this in mind, ...Rajarathinam will try to maneuver it in any direction just to win this case. You must be very careful... ...because this is our first and last chance. I understand. This is 1 out of a 100 cases for him. But all these years, ...I was waiting only for this one case. But, ...he should never find out our strength pa. Don't worry about that dear. I'll take care. Looks like a thunder storm will hit us. Amma will be waiting to eat with us. Let's go home. Sir, please separate me from my wife. I can't take her torture any longer! [overlap of eager voices] Sir, come! Please be calm. Move aside! Come here sir. Give him way. Hi sir. Sir just one selfie, please. I'm a die-hard fan of yours. Sir I'll post it on Facebook and tag you. The other day you said it's a sin to sit or stand next to someone like me! Have you come today to take notes on how my daughter excels as a lawyer? Hello Mr Rajarathinam. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm doing good. Okay Rajarathinam sir. In the last hearing, Venba had asked for certain details... I'm sure you'll be familiar with the case. Yes sir. -You can proceed. -Thank you sir! So I think I've come to take up this crucial case... ...at the most critical time. If I had been negligent even for a nano second, ...our advocate would have passed off criminal Jothi as Mother Teresa's cousin! Usually we take an oath from the witness, promising to speak only the truth. But not even once have advocates like us taken any oath. So for the first time, I think I should ask the defence lawyer to take such an oath. First eye witness, Ramar! Poor man! He narrated then what he witnessed truthfully. Reiterated it now too. Honest man! She has shown a stamp sized photo as if it is a historic piece of evidence! Photo is original. It wasn't taken on the 5th... ...but on May 3rd! Mr Ramamurthy won that year in the Parliament election. His birthday and his electoral victory were both celebrated on the same day! That photo which was taken on the 3rd was published in the papers on the 5th! -Your Honour. -Please sit! I know what you want to say. You'll say this was taken only on the 5th, correct? Your Honour... Murugan who is standing next to Ramar in this photo, ...died after meeting his leader in an accident on the night of May 3rd! His wife is here as witness. Vanakkam sir. This is Murugan's death certificate. So Your Honour like Venba madam claims, if this photo was taken on the 5th... ...then only Murugan's ghost must have posed for the camera. I state this with all humility. The next thing... The gun used by Jothi. In a fire accident in 2007, ...all the important documents were destroyed in the police station in Ooty. That case is also being handled by this court. Our defense lawyer who knew all these details in detail, ...had raised it as a major doubt. She has also used it to her advantage in this case... ..including the missing documents during the fire accident in the station. Venba, any objection? No Your Honour! I would like to interrogate the inspector who handled this case, ...who is the current DSP Mr. Alexander! Okay, proceed. Vanakkam sir. The night of May 6th... ...were you the one who arrested Jothi at Tiruppur railway station? Yes I did along with my team. We searched day and night, Finally arrested her in Tiruppur. How long will it take to travel from Ooty to Tiruppur? Three and a half hours! How did you get the information Jothi intended to escape from Tiruppur? Highly confidential madam. Department secret. I can't share it in public. A criminal who is being hunted by the police all over the town! How could she have travelled from Ooty to Tiruppur without anyone noticing her? We were searching for her in every nook and cranny. Her strength was to mingle with the people and be nondescript. Actually criminals think more intelligently than us madam. Do you have the habit of watching super hero movies, sir? I'm a police officer madam. I don't believe in super heroes, I have faith only in reality. But reality is missing in the way you dealt with this case, sir! When you arrest a lady, you must take a lady constable. Why didn't you? A lady constable was not available in the station that day. We had to arrest the accused at once. Time was running short. -So we left immediately! -Forget that. What time did you arrest Jothi? Where did you get her confession? Any photo or video evidence that she confessed? Why haven't you added anything in your documents? You know, actually madam... ...if creative juices overflow in your mind, go and write a novel. Instead don't ask me such silly questions. Haven't you written in Jothi's case? A novel! I certainly can't make it as spicy as yours. Stick to only replying to my questions. Objection Your Honour! Isn't this the first case for our defense lawyer? That's why she is treating everyone like a criminal! After knowing a child is struggling for her life, ...is it possible to follow procedures the way she expects? We didn't have mobiles then to shoot videos in the blink of an eye. A photographer from the department had to come to click a photo or shoot a video. We didn't have enough time either. So they took Jothi's confession as a written statement. No point asking unnecessary questions and wasting time Your Honour. This is a very sensitive case.' You have seen the video related to Jothi's case innumerable times, ...I ask the court's permission to play that video once more today. Proceed! Madam do you know whom you are supporting?' A North Indian psycho killer who kidnapped and killed innocent children heartlessly! If his team had missed nabbing her, she would have killed... ...so many more children in many more towns. Miss Venba... ...you reopened this case. In the next hearing, ...I want you to produce proper evidence if you have like Mr. Rajarathinam did. Instead of disrespecting higher officials in the name of questioning them. I'll be forced to dismiss the case. Next hearing, day after tomorrow! Court is adjourned! Come here woman. You did a good job. Here's your payment. -How can you pay me so less? -I'll compensate next time. Super! You rocked sir. Different level altogether! You are the best lawyer in the world sir. Something is fishy! Collect all the details about her asap. Okay sir! Why did you come away without presenting your counter? Rajarathinam is trying to play his game using me as his pawn! [flurry of voices] What I say? No, thank you! You there! She was my only child. Killed at a tender age of 10. And you are defending such a cruel psycho killer? How can you have the heart? Are you even human? I've been suffering for 15 years. -Unable to forget my child. -Stop hassling her. -Come away Venba. -You are just a gold digger! -How will you feel a mother's pain? -Don't look back! I curse you bitterly with all my pain and anguish. May you rot in hell! You are just a gold digger. How will you feel my pain?' Damn you! My curse will make you a corpse!' Venba! Venba are you still thinking about that female's rant? So many people have maligned us ever since we reopened this case. They have hit us below the belt, I've even been targeted with a slipper! I wasn't affected one bit. But that mother's anguished wails... ...I can't take it casually just like that pa! Hurts like hell! Venba aren't you fighting this case for that woman's tears too? It will only get worse. They will hurt you, humiliate you! They will even stab you or tear the case to pieces. But if you compare it to Jothi's journey, all this is child's play my dear. This is her diary! I know you've read it more than a 100 times. Still... for my sake, go through it once more! Think you are the Jothi who wrote this. When you personalize an experience only then you feel the depth of that pain. Venba, don't think you are fighting this cause for Jothi. Think you are in Jothi's shoes and fight! Only then your heart will strengthen even more. No one can defeat you. Take this! In life people wish their minds to fly flapping their wings free in the azure sky.' My mind too shared the same thought.' He walked into my life, my idol... to make my wings sprout and soar high.' He and his love for me made me believe even men can be angels, messengers of God.' A fresh start with a new ray of hope in my heart.' My life was wrapped in happiness.' But it was short lived. Just six months.' In the name of honor killing they killed my husband in front of my eyes.' In a life blanketed in darkness I restarted my journey, this time alone...' ...for the other angel in my life!' [baby crying] Welcome to this world, my princess Present in my life; my bud so precious! You nurtured my motherliness Made me blossom with eagerness! I will give my life as milk anytime you want to drink! My hands are your anchor of safety when you want to swim, my sweetie! A million eyes won't suffice to admire your rose-bud face! Palm of my hands too small, my love to rock this blessing from above! A hundred rainbows won't do to paint a masterpiece like you! Your baby scent, sweet and lingering That is enough, come to me, my darling! Your smile made me take my 1st step with a baby push-walker so adept!

My festoon decorating my days Only reason for my life always! This is the contact details of Pethuraj in Tamil Nadu. Go and meet him! Why are you looking so sad ma? Your grandparents are selling this house and shifting to another city with their son! We are moving to a new city? I'm there for you. I'll take good care of you! My darling princess! Sit on my lap.

I am your path to victory My dearest crowning glory! In the azure blue sky let us spread our wings to fly! Your beacon of light I will be! My heart-beat, my sanctuary! Past few days in Nilgiris district...' ...the sudden escalation in child-kidnapping cases.' 'Parents have been cautioned to keep a close watch on their children.' 'By senior police official.' I will be your sky with sunshine bright! Protect you from pain however slight! I will gladly be your best friend! Tick your wish-list till the very end! A chariot without my idol am I Parched land, desolate and dry. Is my language fluent or do I falter? Who am I here, my dear daughter? Trees flower; springtime beauty. Colors add to nature's bounty. My boon, blessing, felicity You mean the world to me. My precious princess heavenly! -'Rehta tha' -Raghu thatha! In Hindi 'Rehta tha' means 'he lived'! -'Raha thatha'. -'Thatha' is grandpa in Tamil! Pethuraj sir has enrolled Pappu in a school. We are happy here.' He went to Chennai and came back with his wife!' Venba! It's getting late. We need to be in court! -Come in and get ready. -Coming pa. Your Honour regarding Jothi accused as 'accused' in this case. Ever since he took over the case, ...Rajarathinam sir has been emphasizing a fact many times. Jothi is a kidnapper from North India. The police official handling this case mentioned a child kidnapped in Jaipur. But I am stating this fact, Jothi is not a North Indian. What! Do you realize what you are saying? The whole world knows she is a murderer from North India. Do you have any evidence to substantiate your statement? Of course sir. I have evidence Your Honour. When a criminal can't be nabbed to close a case easily, ...branding it as North Indian conspiracy... ...has become the norm for some police officials. People naturally resent it when they hear of a North Indian involvement. Tamilian Jothi was branded a North Indian to intensify people's hatred against her. To prove my deduction, ...I request the court to allow me to interrogate Selvi as my next witness. Sir. How can this be allowed without a pre-intimation letter? I think you became a lawyer watching court scenes in movies! According to Section #311 anyone can be called as witness once they attend court. Vanakkam sir. Disclose your details. I am Selvi madam! My hometown is Melur near Madurai. My husband's name is Ramalingam! We have two sons. Our son Duraipandi lives with his family in Madurai. Our daughter is Sakthijothi. We call her fondly as Jothi. Who is Jothi? Tell the court what happened to her. What can I say? So happy we raised our first born daughter with so much love. When she was a student, she fell in love with a boy from another caste. And eloped with him. My husband and people of our caste didn't forgive them. They are prepared to give up anything. But for no reason will they make compromises on caste. One day when that boy was returning home from work, ...under the guise of 'honor killing', they killed him ruthlessly. They went in search of my daughter with the same fervor to kill her! I thought they must have succeeded. Only now I realize she has escaped. Year 2004! A lady by name Jothi. News about her kidnapping children and killing them was the talk of the town! Aren't you aware of anything regarding that? After my daughter-in-law threw me out of the house, ...I had no option but to reside in a religious mutt in Vedaranyam. A monastic life between four walls. I got to know the details from you only after I came here today. Your Honour, Jothi who was declared to be a North Indian... ...is the daughter of Selvi and Ramalingam, a couple whose roots are of Tamil origin. Rajarathinam sir, you can now cross examine the witness! Thank you sir! What is your daughter's full name? Sakthijothi! Doesn't she have an initial or surname? Doesn't matter, do you have at least a photo of her? They burnt all her belongings the day she eloped sir. You'll bombard us with 101 questions about the archive that really got burnt down. Should I believe this lie now? You shared a lot of details about your family history. But you didn't elaborate about Jothi's childhood? A girl with a golden heart sir! She won't dream of hurting even a fly sir. Your daughter Sakthijothi, who would never dream of hurting even a fly, ...went into flight mode as a child kidnapper and killer apparently. She isn't that kind of girl sir. But society believes she was a heartless kidnapper and killer. My daughter is not a heartless human being. I am sure that is a fabrication sir. Maybe it is someone else sir. Please don't cry. That's all Your Honour! Their own witness is refuting it. Poor soul! Imagine summoning a lady as witness who has gone through so much trauma. And using a mother's anguish to her selfish advantage. Jothi of this case could be Jothi Patel. Jothi Agarwal or even Jothi Kapoor. But that Jothi is NOT Sakthijothi! In the court of law I know very well you'll insist evidence is important sir. To prove Sakthijothi is the Jothi in this case. As my next witness, I would like you to permit me to interrogate Mr. Pethuraj. Is the time now 4:20? Like our IPC Section 420 on cheating another fraud as witness to nail a cheat! Mr. Rajarathinam... ...if a criminal like you can defend a criminal case... ...why can't I be the witness for a fraudulent case? [mocking laughter] Did you notice the reaction? Silence! Pethuraj whatever you want to say, come here and speak up. Speak up sir! Do you know the accused Jothi in this case? I knew her very well. Your Honour, I hail from Ooty. I travel often to Chennai for business reasons. I got acquainted with a client in one of those trips. He belongs to Jaipur. He told me Jothi was working in his house in Jaipur. She had to return to Tamil Nadu due to unforeseen circumstances.' He asked me to help him then!' That was how Jothi came here. Later while talking to her, I came to know... ...she lost her husband to the cruel custom of 'honor killing'. Because she was pregnant then, ...with the sole intention of saving her baby, she had no other go but to leave this city. And that was how she landed in Jaipur. Other than that she is not a North Indian as specified in the police records! She is a Tamilian by birth. I got her a job as accountant in Ooty. I got her daughter enrolled in a school. I arranged a place to stay close to my residence. She has the necessary evidence for whatever I stated now! I have also attached her diary along with this Your Honour.' So, Mr Pethuraj... If it is true you helped Jothi in Ooty on grounds of generosity and humanity, ...where were you on the day Jothi was killed in a police encounter? Why didn't you confess to the police on the same day? So you are a partner in the crime connived by Jothi. You have a major share in it too. Am I right? Don't be hasty! Rajarathinam and I haven't finished as yet. Your Honour! 4th of May, 2004. That was the day before Rohith and Diwakar were shot dead by Jothi. Let me tell you a first person account of what transpired in front of my eyes. I was reading the newspaper that evening in front of my house like I always do.' Jothi's daughter was playing there riding her bicycle.' At that time I saw a yellow car cross my house.' I continued reading wondering about the new car that whizzed past my house.' I heard a child screaming out 'amma' suddenly out of the blue.' Flustered. I got up to check'. I ran out and saw.' Jothi was running behind that yellow car.' Two youngsters in the car were dragging that child forcibly into it.' 'The car gathered speed.' -'We were both running...' -Stop it! You spun a good yarn, Pethuraj. Jothi's kid was playing outside it seems. A yellow car sped past at that time. On top of all this, it was Rohith's car and the child was kidnapped in it. They chased that car it seems but it gathered speed and vanished. No use spinning unbelievable tales to create sympathy. Court needs evidence! Proper evidence! We are not stating anything without proper evidence, Your Honour. I have the required proof. I request you to grant me permission to play the second video linked with Jothi's case. Stop! Notice this point, Your Honour. There's a difference between kidnapping and saving a child being kidnapped. Jothi did not kidnap that child. She was saving the kid! Utterly kiddish! If you remove your school uniform and wear a lawyer's coat this will be the outcome. You yell out 'Stop it' when the face is so blurred in that video. And you blabber like an idiot she was saving instead of kidnapping! You accused Jothi of being the criminal with this video with the same blurred face! Your Honour... Jothi didn't express the fury of a kidnapper or killer... ...but a mother's unconditional love. The child Jothi allegedly kidnapped with this video as important evidence is... Jothi's own child. A mother was trying to save her own blood. How can she be accused of cold blooded abduction? Will you please stop it? You are preaching as if you were an eye witness at the crime spot? Oh! Maybe you are confident a dead child can't rise from the grave to contradict! Who said that child is dead? She is very much alive. Yes sir, I was an eye witness at the crime scene. I am the only person who witnessed the entire traumatic event. Because you see... ...I am that kidnapped child! The woman you branded as a psycho killer, ...Sathyajothi's daughter. Jothi ...is my mother! When people assumed Venba was Pethuraj's daughter,' ...she claims to be Jothi's daughter.' This is trending everywhere. What do you think of this news? Be quiet bro.' Renowned advocate Rajarathinam taking up this case without knowing the basic facts,' ...is considered a sacrilege according to senior advocates.' [phone ringing] Good morning sir! [phone ringing continues] Sir, Varadarajan sir is calling you, sir. Let him call sir. Why are you getting flustered sir? Am I not the one paying you sir? Reserve your 'sir' only for me and press the silent mode on my phone! -Now come and serve. -Okay sir. What is the update? I checked Venba's proof and documents of her last hearing thoroughly sir. Be it Venba's school admission certificate or her mother Jothi's signature... ...everything is in order sir! 100% true Venba is Jothi's daughter! After Jothi's demise, Petharaj raised Venba. He isn't her biological father. Sir, they recovered a child's body from an old building in 2004 right? That girl child is Angel sir. She was from an orphanage and during an excursion to Ooty, she went missing. The Father in charge of the orphanage filed a complaint on the very same day. But the police lost that FIR complaint sir.' Sir if you don't get me wrong... So what if I do? Rohith and his friend Diwakar are frauds. Varadarajan hid many facts from me... -That's your point? -Yes sir! Get back to serving me! Good morning sir. -Does it hurt? -Yes sir. You should be careful while playing. Sir, Mr. Rajarathinam is here! Hello Rajarathinam. Why are you looking at the ground? Huh! You think your deeds deserve a direct look in your eyes? I took up this case without any questions because I held you in high respect. Why did you hide the facts from me sir? -Get some snacks. -Okay sir. What fact did I hide? She asked about the gun. Didn't I tell you I am responsible for that gun right in the beginning? Who the hell knew? Out of the blue she will claim to be Jothi's daughter? If I had known I would have told you from A to Z the other day! How can you be so flippant about their heinous crimes? You said she shot your son when he tried to save the child. But your son? Go ahead man, complete your sentence. You were unable to right? What to do? He is my son after all. That's probably why I am washing my hands for the sins of his past. You know how our society has put me on a high pedestal! I want to ensure my good reputation is not tarnished till my last breath. I will safeguard that reputation. Sir if you tell your doctor you have piles feeling ashamed to say you have AIDS, ...you will be treated accordingly. You should have bared your soul when you asked me to take up this case. Instead if you want me to get a martyr's award for your son and you! -How is it possible? -Rathinam! Dismissing the public prosecutor I had you assigned to this case... ...not for you to question me! Were you defending Gandhi and Kamaraj earlier, huh? You defended criminals 90/99 of your cases. 100% true sir! But unlike you, those 90 clients were completely honest with me. After claiming to be Jothi's daughter, ...it wouldn't have taken long for Venba to pin the crime on your son and his friend. Reason she was silent these 15 years, ...was to speak when people were willing to lend an ear. That half-baked petty lawyer Petharaj has drafted a neat screenplay for this case. Rathinam I was apprehensive. You may reject this case if I was upfront with you.' I didn't come clean.' All facts about this case will be at your doorstep tonight.' Jothi is my mother.' Rathinam I need to talk to you in private.' That gun is mine.' Sir, Venba has announced in court she is Jothi's daughter.' Looks like she will win this case.' She has some ace up her sleeve as evidence sir. Hi sir. -Take a seat. -Thanks. -What would you like to have? -Nothing, I'm good. Rewind. Tell me what happened. Sir, based on Jothi's information we went with a dog squad to Lovedale. When the bungalow was searched thoroughly, ...we obtained the information those lads frequent that place. [dog barking] [dog growling] Dig here!' [dog barking] SIR!' Sir, come over here!' When we dug in front of the bungalow,' ...we found the body of a girl child who has been dead for many days.' Sir come here. Please hurry up sir!' [dog barking] When we searched the backyard,' ...we found the bodies of 4 girls in a decomposed state.' It was a cruel sight indeed.' Only then I realized those boys were so inhuman as to not even spare a dog!' Not knowing what to do, I narrated whatever they did to Varadarajan sir.' He sent a doctor over to camouflage the actual facts.' That doctor erased all the evidences of the lads raping those children.' He wiped their slate clean.' We made everyone believe Jothi had buried that child we unearthed.' The bodies of the 4 girls we dug out in that bungalow's backyard,' ...we reburied in Jothi's backyard.' We fabricated that Jothi was the kidnapper and killer.' Where is the doctor now? The doctor has passed away! Those two dog squad officers? They were transferred to a different city immediately. Only the three of us know the whole truth. [automated message] Cha! Rajarathinam sir... The documents submitted by Venba are in order. Do you have any objections?' No sir! Your Honour, what I've been trying to prove from the commencement of this case, ...is that Alex sir and team did not go to Tiruppur to arrest Jothi. I could not proceed with my argument because of insufficient evidence. Now adequate evidence has been submitted about Jothi's nativity. So with your permission may I proceed with Alexander sir? Your Honour, police reports are the backbone of any case. Police department has to go through 101 formalities to prepare them. Eyewitnesses need to be interrogated and all evidences have to be filed properly. But in this case alone, everything has been created. Do you remember this photo? Clicked in 2004 when people protested insisting on Jothi being arrested. Okay. Your Honour, if you scrutinize this photo... ...the hands of the clock tower behind them point at 6:25. Alex sir was also there till that specified time. It takes 3 hours 30 minutes to travel from Ooty to Tiruppur. He was the one who told us in the last hearing. But according to police records, ...I mean as per your records, ...you arrested Jothi at 8:00 p.m. How could you have reached Tiruppur in 90 minutes then sir? Timely point! Please sit down sir. I know what you intend saying.' Time might have stopped on that clock tower? [mocking chuckle] It is the same time on the wrist of the reporter who interviewed the official. Even if he had flown, ...no way he could have reached Tiruppur at 8:00 p.m. So, the fact that you arrested Jothi in Tiruppur turns out to be a lie. To save a child whose life was in danger, ...how could you have gone with Jothi to that old bungalow? Jothi, who tried to escape from your clutches over there. How could you have shot her dead? Your Honour right from the arrest, including the police encounter is a lie. Complete fabrication. A Tamilian by birth has been branded a North Indian. She has been victimized as having kidnapped her own child. Why couldn't those two youngsters be the actual culprits? Maybe the police official framed the innocent Jothi to aid Varadarajan? Bravo! All along I thought this case was about Jothi. Only now I realize madam is trying to turn the tables on Mr. Varadarajan. Sit down!' Didn't you say so? Before saying that I stood up to tell you this. Now do you understand? Jothi was arrested only in Tiruppur. But Alexander didn't arrest her. The local police in Tiruppur did. Alexander hasn't mentioned it anywhere in this charge sheet! Jothi was shifted to the custody of the Ooty police. This is the report filed by Tiruppur police. His biggest mistake was losing the FIR filed on the missing children. No wonder all this confusion. In such a sensitive case thanks to a mistake like this by a police officer, ...half baked lawyers like Venba appear. And support heartless murderers like Jothi! That's exactly why this court does not depend only on one department. Post mortem report by the doctor, forensic report and other records ...maintained by the police are all true. There's nothing to change or contradict in this, Your Honour. Yes, Your Honour! Nothing more to 'change' in these records. Everything has already been tampered with. But there is one contradiction! Actually as shown in the police records, Mr. Alexander did not arrest Jothi. Tiruppur police didn't arrest her either as stated by Mr. Rajarathinam. Truth be told no one arrested Jothi. Jothi surrendered of her own volition, ...to sub inspector Suresh Pandian who was on duty that day! After that, he was made invisible in this case. No! Your Honour madam is wrong about this alleged vanishing act. He had applied for a transfer two months before he handled this case. It was sanctioned and he was transferred and only one week later... He didn't ask for a transfer, Your Honour! Suresh Pandian is the only police officer who knows the truth behind this case. In order to prevent Suresh from being called upon as a witness, ...as if he had nothing to do with this case, ...the transfer was a move well planned by Alexander. Now, Suresh Pandian is an important witness in this case. You should permit him to be summoned for the next argument Your Honour. Your Honour I am wondering if our lawyer passed out of Law college or a crematorium! She keeps summoning witnesses from their graves! First Jothi! Then those two dog-squad officers. Finally, Suresh Pandian now! He committed suicide last night due to excess work pressure. Everybody in this department is aware of this tragedy. Suresh Pandian commits suicide due to excess workload.' Even now if you notice, as if unaware of his demise,' ...her expression will be one of utter surprise and absolute innocence. Jothi can't become a saint because you are her daughter! It is true Jothi killed innocent children brutally.' Police unearthed the bodies of the deceased in your backyard is also true!' And it is true the two youngsters who intervened were killed.' In fact, I have to list out all these facts as truth to convert your lies into truth. That is nothing but the whole truth! What's up 'nanba'? Sorry Venba! Venba Pethuraj. Venba Sakthijothi! How do I address you? Do you know whom you are pitting your wits against? Rajarathinam! You would have studied law just to defend this case. But when laws were drafted for our nation, ...my family held these law books in their hands with experience. I have seen many cases like this to reach this rung in my ladder of success! I had a niggling doubt something was fishy in this case. Every case has a weak point. That has made you and me reach our present standpoint. Reaching is not important. But the research and final result! You have lied through your teeth! Do you know why Varadarajan has brought me into this case now? Because I am the best! But there is a beast in me too! To pep up the case and make it more interesting, ...I'll give the defense attorney precious points on a golden platter. When I asked you about Ramar over the phone, ...you said you created the character to strengthen your case. I believed you for Varadarajan's sake. But you still have some facts you have forsaken! You might as well tell me before Venba spills the beans in court tomorrow! Will you confess now? Or be confined? Sir... I didn't arrest Jothi! She surrendered. I chose to do this with a greed for promotion. Jothi surrendered to Suresh. I got the truth out and told Varadarajan!' I suggest you discard your coat and look for some other job.' If you don't get any job join as my junior.' At least first of every month you are assured of a salary!' Enough my dear! I can't bear to see you like this. Wrap up everything! We have nothing left to fight. We have lost dear. I am so... I am so scared I may lose you! You should not be scared of anything other than truth. We will be harassed even more. You taught me not to take two steps back when they hassle or humiliate you. Am I hearing this from you? Laws and court are designed to suit the needs of those with money and might. Not for us, the common people! No pa! I have faith in our system. Only liars will prosper!' If that is so and only bad people can win, this world would've been destroyed long ago. Just because of this hardship, ...how can I let go of this case half way through? Truth should triumph pa! I don't agree with you. Whatever you may say my mind can't be consoled. Listen to your father. Best solution is to let go! Dreams diffuse into oblivion. Won't night dawn in my horizon? Won't life take a new turn from now on? Venba don't be worried okay? Go, sleep. Goodnight! Won't truth one day be out in the open? Motivating me is your role. Your words hurt, heart and soul! What will I do with my unfulfilled goal? Hands that helped me to safety, how will I sleep without any anxiety? Will I find my way, I wonder, to touch the sky in all its splendor? How can loss of one witness make us lose this case? If SI Suresh Pandian is not alive, this case is as good as buried! It is all dead and gone! Don't say it like a broken record. There must be a way. I have full faith! I am telling you, we have lost! [clap of thunder] Please understand. Without him we have nothing to go by! What really happened to Jothi?' Why was she arrested and killed in a police encounter?' Our quest for 15 years in finding the only man who knew the truth as it is.' Our first and final witness was sub inspector Suresh Pandian!' Jothi surrendered to me first sir. The fact I arrested her or the police encounter, ...both are lies! To prevent her from exposing the truth to the world, ...she was murdered. Sir at least after all these years, ...the world should know Jothi was innocent and a victim. Please come and narrate this verbatim in court sir! Definitely! I am most willing to tell the whole truth in court sir. No one can file a case against a big shot like Varadarajan. I made people believe I was filing a case for mere publicity. Through Suresh Pandian somehow we thought... ...we can reveal the truth behind this tragedy to the whole world! Varadarajan was cunning enough to replace the public prosecutor with Rajarathinam. We were convinced we can bring justice to Jothi's demise and clear her image. That's why we bore the brunt of all the hassles and humiliation silently. But what is the use? Suresh was the pulse for this case! His pulse is ruptured now.' Even if the leaves fall in fall this tree will stand firm and tall! You are eternal spring after all! Even if darkness drowns you in gloom don't give in to despair and doom! O' dawn's rays; glow and bloom! Seasons favor you readily Scars gone with the wind verily. Let us live life to the fullest daily! Unexplored depths to unravel Extent of the sky to travel! Let us climb the skies of success as well! Even if severed by a sword's blow, Be a root that struggles to grow. Stand firm to face the morrow! Like petals don't wither and fall Be the root to prop up tall! Wear the garland of victory; don't stall! You should never be scared of anyone or anything in life.' Stand bold brave and tall!' Fight with full faith in your belief.' Amma will always be with you!' No daughter will call a kidnapper as her mother with this conviction. That is proof enough. Some kind of strange truth lies behind every word you utter! If it is true listening to your conscience you are fighting for truth, ...the God you believe in and the prayers of mothers who lost their children like me, ...will support you in solidarity. Fight till the very end till everyone is aware of the real truth. Go! -Give me the phone. -I won't! Get lost!' -Welcome. -Vanakkam madam. Please sit down. May I know who you are? -Please sit. -She is Venba! Mr Pethuraj's daughter! He used to keep talking about you. -Hi. -Hi! Fine, don't give. I'll take appa's phone. Vanakkam! I am Varadarajan. Vanakkam! I have heard about you sir. She is Venba. Known to my husband. She has come from Ooty. I'll get coffee for you sir!. Venba... I am quite surprised to see you here. Did you send off Suresh to rest in peace? I don't know how many will follow suit before this case is wrapped up? Sir don't let your tongue run! Hey! Don't interrupt me when I'm talking. Just shut up. What will you achieve by reopening this case? Just let go of everything. You can't resolve anything. That's how it will seem now. We can tackle it. You can leave. Didn't I tell you to shut up? How dare you threaten us! What atrocities you... Damn you! Respect! When I talk only my voice should be heard. There are hordes of people waiting to fall at my feet if I step out of this house. I need to be respected until my dying day! I will caution you only once patiently. Not every single time. Abandon everything and go. Do you get what I said? Don't get perturbed! It was an accident when I got up the glass broke. I'll take leave now, I have work to attend to! I wanted to inform you I would like to take care of your children's education. Please don't hesitate to ask me if you need help of any sort. I don't want to trouble you sir. I'm so glad you found time to come all the way to visit me. Venba I'm leaving! Careful! We'll also take leave madam. Call us if you need any help. -We are there for you. -Okay! I'm really sorry for your loss. Venba are you producing any evidence? Listen I'm asking you. Your Honour, not the usual grace time! Even if you give two years, this case won't have evidence. She won't even have 'Evi' in evidence let alone the full eight letter word! For the simple reason such an evidence doesn't exist. This may be her only case! I have a huge backlog of pending cases to attend to. No daughter can bear to have even a villainous mother vilified. She will fly into a rage for sure. She isn't in a mental state to understand Jothi's crime. I ask this court in all humility to arrange a professional psychiatrist to treat her... Why beat around the bush? Be direct! Call me a lunatic. For 15 long years, ...convinced I could bring to light the facts concealed in this case, ...I put up with all the humiliation. I must be mad! Justice will triumph! This court always strives to be impartial in its verdict to people. I believe that even now in utter foolishness. You bet I am mad! Knowing the voice box of victims is being silenced. I am standing before you, my hands tied alone and helpless! I am definitely a lunatic. How is it sir? If girls fight for justice with courage and conviction, you label it as madness? If we elaborate our problems aloud to society it is termed 'drama'! If we share our tears, we are drama queens! Why is the pain behind our truths always fake and false to you sir? Rajarathinam sir! Have you ever got up in cold sweat from a nightmare, ...dreaming a hundred people are strangling you at the same time? What? Never, I'm sure! Renowned advocate family right? What is pain? For that matter what is loss or scars? Absolutely clueless! But I wasn't that lucky. It has been years since I slept peacefully for a whole night. Behind the flash of my smile are unshed tears. Unleashed rage within me, I'm unable to put my past behind me. Every single night, ...I die a thousand deaths hounded by hands belonging to unknown faces chasing me. Pain! Loss! Bruises! They are indelible scars all over my body! Your Honour do you remember Aasifa? I am sure you do. Because there's a child in your house and mine, ...who has to grow up crossing Aasifa's age. Aasifa! Hasini! Nandhini! Names we come across daily. Just News to us. Have you ever thought of your child in those children's shoes even once? Only then you will know the raw pain of what was just News to you. As far as we are concerned, ...we assume our children are growing up in a protected environment! But that isn't true. In one of those affectionate moments spent with your children ask them with concern. Someone you know at some point in time would have sexually abused that child. In all the streets in our country, ...there are many Aasifas and Hasinis. But they lack the guts to express the atrocities forced on them. Some don't even know how to disclose the abuse they are suffering under duress. Before knowing the joys and sorrows life metes out! Disregarding the fact she is a child to take advantage of her body, ...is the most barbaric violence. If every sexually abused child starts talking point-blank and publicly, ...the pristine images of so many so called noble souls... ...will splinter into a million shards! Why are you talking in verses true to your name 'Venba'? Speak up like a lawyer! Is there any connection between your sermon and this case? Of course, Mr. Rajarathinam! That is the reason I took up this case after all these years! The same reason my mother shot dead those two youngsters. You keep branding all this as innocent right? Atrocities of those two youngsters activated this torturous trauma. You keep saying Jothi shot those innocent lads... Why did she shoot them? Tell me if even a single person here knows the reason behind that pain? I know Your Honour! Venba! Don't my dear. Sorry pa. Some truths need to be exposed. Even in the smallest grain of truth we conceal under the guise of disgrace, ...so many monstrous villains become glorified heroes! My mother hated seeing me shed tears even if dust fell into my eyes. But they kidnapped me in front of her protective eyes! Those two youngsters raped many girl children. I am also one of them! Whenever I am alone, ...replaying the mental image of their hands abusing my body... ...I have screamed in terror so many days and nights. That surge of panic! Alarm! Pain! Just one drop of tear for all my trauma. I am fighting for some sort of justice! For all those wide-eyed innocent children who got raped just like me. Bodies of the four children unearthed in my backyard allegedly killed by Jothi, ...were raped and killed by those two vile youngsters! The police fabricated all this and filed their First Information Report! Doctors who conducted the post mortem and the police officers who handled this case... ...are partners in this crime! All this was Varadarajan's conspiracy to save his son Rohith and his friend. To show the miscreants in good light, ...he blackened my innocent mother as a psycho killer! Sub inspector Suresh had a change of heart and was willing to confess everything. Getting wind of his intentions they threatened him. They forced him to commit suicide! And blamed it on pressure of work. She is rambling unnecessarily and misleading this case. Sir sit down. Allow her to talk!' To prove any of that. I have nothing to submit as evidence except truth and tears, Your Honour. To claim I struggled and lost, ...this isn't a game! Justice! I'm not standing here as an advocate today, ...but a girl victimized. I am speaking with the firm faith only truth will triumph. Because throughout this world, ...many who have been traumatized through physical abuse and violence ...won't have any other evidence other than truth, Your Honour. Listen Venba, my solace is ever present for those who were affected by this trauma. But for a judge, ...evidence presented in front of his eyes... ...will determine the nature of his verdict.' Your mother Jothi killed those four children ...is confirmed by the post mortem and forensic reports. There is no evidence in any report to aid your theory those children were raped. When no blame can be pinned on those two youngsters, ...how can you accuse Varadarajan of being a criminal? Judgment is tomorrow. Court is adjourned! How many more women? How many more children?' How long will this continue to each and every one of us too?' How can evidence be provided for such cases sir?' I consider myself as that girl's father.' She is striving so hard for justice!' But what is the use? Our law leans towards the rich not poor.' Sir, court needs evidence! Tears won't win cases.' Child rape is the worst crime!' If this happened to my child I swear I won't spare that blackguard.' What to do? Our laws are flawed!' This is our Law!' According to our Court of Law when a girl files a case of rape,' ...court doesn't require the truth. Verdict hinges on evidence only!' Where is your advocate? No sir er... due to personal reasons she was unable to attend court today! I've lost amma. I couldn't defend you. Everything has slipped out of our hands. Forgive me ma. Forgive me. I have failed you ma. I LOST MA! VENBA! Venba... Venba you haven't lost! The case hasn't slipped out of your hands. In this case, I had specified judgment will be passed today. But regarding this case, ...scrutinizing the case history more than just once... ...I think it will augur well to interrogate Mr. Varadarajan! Your Honour, I think this is an unrequired confusion. It is crystal clear Mr. Varadarajan is in no way connected to this case. Why drag him into this sir? Rajarathinam sir in some twisted logic his name has been pulled into this case. What is your problem sir in Varadarajan being summoned? We can close this case and all of us can move on right? That is exactly my thought too. Close the case and move on. There's no reason in changing your mind after intending to pronounce judgment! Why this unnecessary tension? This court's main purpose is to sift and sieve the truth. How can I pass judgment before exploring all avenues? Your Honour, this is unfair. I somehow feel you are showing favoritism. Rajarathinam sir, mind your words. No I won't allow him to be summoned here for sure! STOP IT! Varadarajan has to be here for the next hearing. I will close this case only after he is interrogated! This case can't be wrapped up according to your whims and fancies. The next hearing is day after tomorrow! The court is adjourned! Venba you haven't lost my dear. [mobile ringing] -Hello? -'Member of Parliament Anand Kumar here.' I heard you have summoned Mr. Varadarajan to court.' Are you in your right senses?' As if I will decide off the cuff sir? I know Mr. Varadarajan inside out. But ever since that girl posted the case in High court for retrial, ...she has mentioned his name quite often. So what man?' Tomorrow I should not be blamed for inadequate interrogation. Just as a formality, ask him to attend the proceedings sir. I can wrap up the case! Is that so?' And then sir... What are you pitching for? Out with it! I've fixed my daughter's wedding date. Congratulations! You must put in a word to Mr. Varadarajan. You could have told me your position right in the beginning of our chat. He has deep pockets and a generous heart. -'I will ask him to attend the wedding.' -Thank you sir! -Here sir. -All yours sir! Hey! What have you done? You were the epitome of righteousness. You sold your soul stooping so low because you had a financial crunch! If your family has to hold you in high regard, ...you were the one who told me money is an evil necessity. Now you are acting so prim and proper. Why target this case? How did you have the heart to do this? I consider it a sin to have anything to do with you. Sir please don't... Are you reassuring me not to be scared Rathinam? 15 years ago I took all efforts to diligently close this case with a big lid! What is it she can ask me? Is Jothi's case Mr. Varadarajan here? Yes sir! Varadarajan. Sir... Venba you can proceed! Your name? Varadarajan! Tell me about yourself. I'm an ordinary man. Through Rohith Trust and companies, ...I give financial aid to about 20,000 poor families in Tamil Nadu, ...and educational expenses of their children. I do what I can to help the people below poverty line. A company you own in Tiruppur, ...it has been indicted for encroachment on agricultural lands! Not just an accusation my dear. A case was filed. Court felt those cases were mere publicity stunts and dismissed them. 20 years ago, ...your garment business incurred losses. In order to claim insurance money, you cleared the entire stock... ...and set the factory on fire deliberate... Objection, Your Honour! Rajarathinam sir.' It's true my factory was burnt down. Insurance company enquired about the accident thoroughly. Only then handed over the claim amount to me. So many such similar complaints are piled against you. But none of them get filed as cases! How is that sir? If cases are filed based on rumors... ...1000 cases or more will have to be filed against every individual dear! There won't be enough courts in our country to handle them. If you want to know about a person you must enquire with the people properly. No point in just browsing through Google to interrogate me. Venba ask questions pertaining to this case alone. Sir why are you so silent? Wait and watch. I have a bomb just for the climax! That's your trademark! 2004! Near Peelamedu signal under the pretext of running a public welfare scheme... ...you assembled a huge crowd. It created a gridlock for two hours. A patient in an ambulance got stuck in that traffic and even died. In fact, people say you had deliberately planned the traffic jam to kill him! Do you accept it? Given a chance will you blame me for every single crime in Coimbatore dear? Even to swat a mosquito which sits on me to bite me... ...I think twice before doing so. Mr. Varadarajan I am an advocate. Don't address me with all these endearing terms. Do you understand? 'Amma' is not a demeaning word my dear. Isn't it our custom in Tamil Nadu to address our women as 'amma'? It is customary to add a suffix 'da' to men to denote disrespect too! Shall I do so? Hey! How dare you! You won't step out alive! Silence! Do you think this is court or a fish market? Sit down.' I came to this court only because I respect our judiciary system. She doesn't know the meaning of the word 'respect'! Hope you are aware. I shall take leave! Respect! 'Damn you!' I need to be respected until my dying day.' Varadarajan. Did I ask you to leave? Mr. Varadarajan... Till she completes her interrogation... ...kindly cooperate. Can't bribe everyone and buy their silence. How do I come across to you? If I come for a hearing will you treat me with total lack of respect like this, huh? Standing here in the witness box, ...to a criminal even an interrogation will seem like humiliation, Varadarajan! Just answer my questions. Aren't you one among the few using licensed pistols in Coimbatore? Yes! So what now? Has your son used your pistol? He was very young. He had no idea where my pistol was. Please come. Varadarajan. Look at me! -When your son died... -No...! My son didn't die of natural causes. He was mur... murdered! Okay fine! Few days after his death, ...did you visit Ooty? Yes! At that time do you remember visiting any other place in Ooty? No! -I didn't visit any other place. -So you claim. But I have a witness here who contradicts you. Do you recognize him? He is the only witness who saw Alexander handing over Jothi to you. He opened the gates of your tea factory for you on that day! Why are you sweating sir even in this cold Ooty weather? Is it out of fear? Fear? There is no need for me to be afraid of anyone or anything. Then tell the truth da! How dare you address me with disrespect 'di'? Yes da! Anyhow, even if you don't blurt out the truth he will do the needful. Who the hell is he to tell di? I will tell you myself. Yes! I went there. This court or law can't hurt or harm me. Varadarajan do you realize what you are saying or where you are standing?' Why did you go there? Answer her question! How can he answer that Your Honour? I will tell you... ...what might have transpired. This kind of pain a parent of a girl child should never experience.' In front of her parents if a girl child is kidnapped...' When my mother was right there,' ...because of those boys,' ...I was traumatized!' More than the pain when those boys kidnapped me,' ...it was my mother's anguished scream.' Pappu...! It echoed in my ears!' What happened? Pappu...! Hey! Amma...! Someone... help! Save my daughter! Hey...! Amma...! Help... help me! Amma...!' Pappu...!' Pappu... Pappu! Pappu.' Where are you my dear? Hidden somewhere with hands tied,' ...not knowing what he was doing to me.' Numb! Not able to react.' I was shattered.' The pain that seared through me,' ...can't be described.' Pappu...? I will be your sky with sunshine bright. Protect you from pain however slight! Wake up dear! I will gladly be your best friend. Don't you always say you don't like your amma crying? Tick your wish-list. I am crying now no? Till the very end! Open your eyes. Tell me not to cry. A chariot without my idol am I. Parched land, desolate and dry! Don't hurt me!' Is my language fluent or do I falter? Who am I here, my dear daughter? How can this happen to you?' Trees flower; springtime beauty. God! Wish it was me instead!' Colors add to nature's bounty. My boon, blessing, felicity. You mean the world to me! My precious princess heavenly. Get up Pappu! Won't someone in this world take me away from all this?' Praying desperately!' That was when I heard my mother sob 'Pappu' with such anguish.' Amma is here. I won't die ma.' I felt like telling her I won't leave you so soon.' You will be fine my dear. There was just like me equally devastated,' ...another girl!' Angel.' When I told my mother,' ...she ran to save her panic stricken... agitated.' Poor girl was already dead.' How much pain she must have endured!' [dog barking] Hey, catch her! Don't... Don't touch her! Get her! Come and help me. Let go...! Get hold of her. To make the criminal an innocent victim...' Machaan!' ...my mother shot them with a country gun the police claime!d' That gun...' ...was in the possession of Varadarajan's son.' Hey! Don't. Listen to me. Hand over the gun. Don't shoot. Give it.' Run... run! Come on! Machaan... dude?' Don't... don't shoot! [banging on door] Jothi, I was looking for you all over the place. What happened to Pappu? Let me carry her. Oh God! What is this blood stain? Oh God! What is this? She is also bleeding. What happened dear? Jo... Jothi...! Jothi! Philomina...? Oh God! A new twist in the case of children missing for the past few weeks.' ...police suspect the psycho killer seen in the video...' ...may be responsible for the series of child-kidnappings in Ooty.' Amma...! Pappu don't worry. I'm right next to you. Police inspector Alexander's team in Ooty...' ...has been hunting high and low for the psycho killer.' In addition, shoot at sight orders have been issued.' Jothi...? -Where is Jothi? -She is inside. -Why are you so flustered? -I'll tell you! Jothi! Jothi, the police have found out our house is in this area. They might be here any minute. Escape with the child through the back door! Sir the police will find me anyway. You have helped me so much. My child... please! Take her somewhere safe. What are you saying? How can we leave you like this and go? Your life will be wasted. We can all leave together. I'll get you both to a safe plac... This child's life is more important! Listen to her please.' Let us take the child away before the police find us.' In life you should never be scared of anyone or anything in life.' Stand bold, brave and tall!' Fight with full faith in your belief.' Amma will always be with you.' Right here! You are my lioness right? Amma will be with us soon. My mother surrendered voluntarily to the police just to save me.' She surrendered to sub inspector Suresh Pandian.' When he took my mother to present her in court...' ...half way through he was asked to bring my mother to Mr. Varadarajan.' Ordered by inspector Alexander!' All these years... ...I have been fighting for only this one minute! Shattering someone's identity... ...is the biggest violence! The world should have revered Jothi as a Goddess. Instead she was defamed as a demon and you were made to believe so! In this land where a hungry man was beaten to death for stealing a handful of rice... ...sex perverts who raped hundreds of women and recorded it... ...are roaming the roads scot-free! Even if a person is beaten to death... ...he will breathe his last in one day. But rape! That pain! Suffering! That too at such a tender age. No one should go through it, Your Honour. Girls who have been victimized like me... ...I am not sure how many more Venbas will come out in the open and speak up! But speak hereafter with courage without any inhibitions. People should believe criminals cannot bribe and buy justice, Your Honour! Because to say we women have lost... ...this is not a game Your Honour. Justice! Rajarathinam sir, do you have any questions? I have nothing to ask. But I have only one statement to make. Venba... ...is not Jothi's daughter at all. You are not her daughter. I meant you are Jothi's angel! When we dug in front of the bungalow...' ...we found the body of a girl child.' Equally devastated. Another girl' That girl child is Angel sir!' In this case of shooting Jothi...' ...covering up his son's crimes...' ...all charges against Varadarajan have clearly been proved to be true!' Not only that...' ...Inspector Alexander who was an accomplice and his team...' ...have been aiding and abetting Varadarajan in many instances.' Accused number one, Varadarajan, will serve a double life sentence!' His abettors, Alexander and his team,' ...will serve 10 years in prison according to the verdict of this court.' You are not Jothi's daughter, Venba. You are her angel! Others may not be aware... ...but I am unable to fathom this. What a daughter may not do for her own mother, ...you have accomplished for Jothi. Without any blood ties that bind, ...for a random stranger, ...why did you go this far? Is this love...? Or debt of gratitude? Pain sir!' To feel someone's pain...' ...we don't need to be blood related sir.' True, I am not Venba.' I am Angel...!' When I was fervently hoping someone will come to save me.' Jothi answered my prayers...' ...instead of leaving after seeing her Venba lying lifeless.' I was struggling to breathe and she saved me.' Pappu... Pappu...! Pappu! Don't you always say you don't like your amma crying?' Open your eyes. Tell me not to cry!' Get up Pappu.' Get up my princess.' Pappu. please get up and look at me.' Only because I understood her pain and sacrifice...' ...I am now living as Jothi's Venba.' I request this to all of you.' How a girl child should behave...' Places she can go...' Her dress code...' Parents who teach her whom to talk to or befriend...' ...should also teach the boys living under the same roof...' ...how to regard respect and relate to girls and women.' 12 year old girl gang raped!' India ranks 7th in child sexual abuse. And Tamil Nadu occupies the third place... ...according to National Crime Records of 2018. Under the Child Sexual Abuse Protection Act, ...there are more than 1,66000 cases pending in India. In 94% of these cases, ...perpetuators are mostly close or known to the victim. These inhuman criminals should be punished at the earliest. That should be a lesson to others. Isn't justice delayed injustice? Subtitled by rekhs assisted by Harini and Pradeep! Dreams diffuse into oblivion. Won't night dawn in my horizon? Won't life take a new turn from now on? If a witness is hidden will the scene be forgotten? Won't truth one day be out in the open? Motivating me is your role. Your words hurt, heart and soul. What will I do with my unfulfilled goal? Hands that helped me to safety, How will I sleep without any anxiety? In a labyrinth of a forest walking in circles am I lost? Or will I find my way I wonder to touch the sky in all its splendor? Even if the leaves fall in fall this tree will stand firm and tall. You are eternal spring after all! Even if darkness drowns you in gloom, don't give in to despair and doom. O' dawn's rays; glow and bloom!
