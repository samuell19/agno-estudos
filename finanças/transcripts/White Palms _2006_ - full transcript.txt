Summer is past, oh how it did fly Over, all over, and l still question why. ... and I'm standing there, naked, in the middle of the room, with my back to the entrance, and this nun comes in. And then I says to her, you'd better get out, 'cause I'm gonna lay such a big fart even I'm gonna be sorry. - Now Imre, listen! - Know what I mean? - This here... this is the gold sheIf. - This is serious stuff.

Seventy-five gold medals altogether and I don't even know how many certificates. How can anyone possibly get so many medals? Strength. Muscle, strength. Hard muscles. Come, Imre brother, drink! Come on! This way. He's talented at everything. Here you go. If you tell him to swim, he swims, if you say tennis, he plays tennis. - He has a biceps like a half brick. - Come over here my son and show Uncle Imre your muscles. Come on. Hey! Mikl?s. Son! Your mother is talking to you. Show Uncle Imre your muscles! - He doesn't have to if he doesn't want to. - Sure he does. He's just shy. Get undressed! - Mikl?s! - That's alright.

Hey, what happened to your leg? Coach Feri hit me with the sword. What sword? What do you mean he hit you? What did you do? I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? What did you do? - Nothing. - What's this sword you're talking about? You probably did something. He wouldn't have hit you for nothing. What did you do? Nothing. - What did you do? - Quit asking him what he did! - What did you do? - I stood on the line. - Don't lie. I asked you what you did! - I stood on the line. - The line? - You did something stupid. What did you do? - You were doing something bad again, right? - What did you do? - I threw something. - What did you throw? - At the girls. The girls? What? What did you throw at the girls? Hm?

Don't you catch cold now! Don't catch cold! Just to remind you, you could pay attention to the kid. It's kids like that who grow up to be criminals. Happy holidays! It's none of his business. Thinks he knows it all! Who asked you? None of his business... Thinks he's so smart... Gentlemen! The sports physician... complained to me that you people are in bad shape. He also said... that some people told him practice was too hard. Let's make one thing clear. Today, everyone will suffer because of one person. But first, let's see who the traitor is. You? - You? - No. Who was it? Was it you? Dong?, curtain! Ladies! This gentleman betrayed us! Bend over! Grab your ankles! Pardon the disturbance! Have a nice day, ladies! Come on! Dong?, curtain! For the children's sake I would like to ask our dear parents to wait outside in the hallway. The hallway, please. Thank you Boys, please line up at the vault! Today we will learn how to do a handspring. Good, good. It was nice, my son. Go on like this. Good. You have to stick, son. That's two points off at a competition. Fantastic! Good. Bravo, son! J?zsi, a very good exercise. Congratulations! Very good. No problem. Let's try again. Come on! What's wrong son? I'm here to help you. Come on, let's try it again. Come on. Come here, son! Listen up, you little piece of shit! You know that, you're the only one here who could become a real gymnast. You know you have to do this jump tomorrow? Yes? Yes. And you know what will happen if you don't do it? Yes? - Yes. Then keep that in mind. Get lost! - What are you doing? - I'm going to have a bath. - When did you get home? - A while ago. Why didn't you say hello? I did say hello. Hurry up then. It's late. Bakos! Here! - B?thory! - Here! - Buday! - Here! Dombordi! - Here! - Domokos! - Here! - Dong?! Dong?! Dong?! Dong?! What are you doing? Are you sleeping? What's here? A hotel? What's this? A hotel? The competition is tomorrow and you're sleeping? Out chasing whores at night and not sleeping? Then you drop off in the middle of a fucking exercise! What are you doing? Let it go! Can you listen to me? Let it go! Let it go! Who do you think you are? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Good afternoon! Hello! Excuse me! Hello! Excuse me! Good day. Is this where they train gymnasts? Ah, yes, yes, gymnasts, gymnasts. We're from the Aur?ra Circus. Ah, yes, the Au?ra! Yes, yes, come, right this way. Ah, no, no, no, your shoes! Take your shoes off, please. That's right. Well then? How can I help you? - We'd like to take a look at the boys. - Ah, yes, sure, sure, go ahead. Line up! - Here they are. - Thank you. All first-class gymnasts, gentlemen. I am very proud of them. All of them have won national gold medals in their age group. And the team won a silver medal at the Junior Olympics. Can any of them do the Gienger with a full twist? Three of them know how Ginger. Let's see... This one. ...and this one... ...and this one here. We'd like to have a look. Well, how should I put it... what exactly are you gentlemen interested in? One of our trapeze artists is injured and we would like to have a boy fill in at tonight's performance. No, I'm very sorry, but it's impossible. We have a competition tomorrow. These boys mean everything to me. There used to be 40, now there are only these 6. Gymnasts are sensitive creatures. Any small injury will wipe them out. We can't take chances. We'd like to see them anyway. I'm sorry, it's impossible. These are professional secrets. But wait! The youth competition is tomorrow. You can have a look at them there. That'll be too late. Thank you. Good bye! - I'm very sorry. - Goodbye. Well, gentlemen, that's just the way it is. I'm sorry if I disappointed you. Thank you. Goodbye. Just one more thing. These boys are gymnasts, asshole. Not circus clowns. Hey! This is not a circus! Hey! They are not monkeys! They're gymnasts! You idiot! Dong?! Where were we? Grab your ankles! Come on! Grab your ankles! What did I say? I said grab your ankles! Dong?! You are not going anywhere! Dong?, did you lose your mind? What happened to you? You damned! Where do you think you're going? Come here! Fuck! You think that... You know what that means? - It means that... - I don't believe this. Fuck! Your muscle fibers hardened and stunted your growth! You belong to... Your mother! You hear? You belong with the gymnasts! You prick! - How old are you? - Sixteen. - Sixteen? - Yes. - And you can do Gienger? - Yes. With full twist? Yes. Artyom, come here! - Can you do the Gienger? - I can. A triple? Yes. And the suppl?? - Yes. - Fine. Have you been on a trapeze before? No. lt is our sad duty to inform you that... I read that this is going to be your last competition. That's right. But it'll also be my first world competition. Then why do you want to quit? Well, this will actually be a comeback for me, because I quit years ago to become a coach... ... so this is one last opportunity for me to prove that I really am a gymnast. If I'm correct, your prot?g? will also be entering the World Championships. What can you tell me about him? All I found out was that he's only nineteen years old. Yes. He is a very very clever, intelligent gymnast... I think Canada has all its hope invested in him. But it does seem a little strange to me, because you will be competing against each other. Yes, it is strange. But that's how it happened. I assume you would like to win. I don't want to win, but I hate losing. Good luck, good luck. Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's have a big round of applause for the participants of the Debrecen Gymnastics World Championships! Put down that damned camera. You don't even know what you are recording. We would like to ask the competitors to step up to their starting apparatus. Pay attention, because he's telling you what you'll have to do! You'll have four jumps. First round: a straight body somersault. A stretched-body somersault. Above the trapeze. That's number 2. Okay? Number 3 is a simple suppl?. No problem. Yes? Then you stand out again. And start the fourth from there. That's a Gienger with a full twist. Understand? Yes? Remember, you'll always get the trapeze in your hand, but you only jump when he gives you the signal. He'll clap. That's when you start. Watch him! Relax. You're in good hands! Don't worry! A beautifully executed, elegant jump. Bravo! The judges award Kyle Manjak's routine a 9.65. which means, Ladies and Gentlemen, that he enters the finals in fourth place. His coach, Mikl?s Dong? ranks second, only a few thousandths behind the Romanian world champion Dragulescu. A fantastic achievement. Here's the contract. Read it over! Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. What's this, without net? - That's what's in the program. - No way! It's what we advertised. That is his business, not yours. No. He won't do anything. You want to or no? No. That's his decision, not yours. No. I not do. Everyone comes see. The death twist without safety net. I bought this show, and it what everyone come to see. The audience want see death twist without net, They don't get it, they don't come any more to circus. And circus is over. Dead. We go to cemetery, to cry. Without net. Now it's good. Here.
