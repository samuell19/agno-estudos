SECOND HAND CHILD Mom? Mom, are you already... "Happy... ...Birtday." It's coming up to 7:26 a. M... Oh, damn! Hi, Tobias! You want one? What was that all about? You interested in him? No. I did it just... because. - "Because!" I was in the Alps. It was crap. No more snow. Bye! Tobias! Lena wants to know where you went on vacation. I didn't go away. - 'Course not. His mom doesn't have any dough. Hey, nice clothes! Charity shop? - Hey cool it. Morning. Morning. - Morning. Sit down everyone, and quiet, please. This is your new classmate. This is Felix Aiger, the son of your math and PE teacher. Damn! You could be friendlier! Felix, please sit there, by Tobias. Look, it's Tobias's birthday today! 13! Congratulations! "...dear Tobias..." "If you had never been born, we'd never notice it, for sure. Congratulations, you loser." That's a real nice song! Hey, Tobias, you bring us something? - Of course he didn't. He's broke. He can't bring anything. Now, get out your books. Hey, it's cheapo loser-cake! Ugh... Tobias, it seems you haven't learned anything! Once a loser, always a loser. - That's mean! I want to talk to your mother after class. Can I reach her by phone? Sit down! Excuse me. Ms. Baumann, this can't go on. He's consistently late, cuts class, and doesn't do homework anymore. And now something like this! You promised us that you would take better care of Tobias. He hasn't even handed in the application for the weekend trip. We'd even agreed that it's important that you both go on the trip. Well, if it'll do some good... okay, sure... What about his father? Why doesn't he support you? - I don't have one! - Shut up! There... isn't a father. You could get some parental guidance. - No, I don't want any. Nobody tells me how to raise my kid! Not even the child agency. As you wish. But we can't solve his problems here at school. Tobias doesn't have any problems. Come on, Fritze's waiting. Good bye. My babe! Yeah, yeah... Hey, little turd! Why'd you get us outta bed so early? Forget it, Fritze! - But it's true! Get in! God damn it! You can get out now! Go! Ciao. See you tonight. - Get in then! Let's go eat. Have a nice birthday. You're such an asshole! - Watch your mouth! Leave him alone! - I'm just joking. See you, kid! - Asshole! - I'll hit you if you say that again! Got it? Goddam little jerk-off! - Yeah... Excuse me! Your dinosaur's escaping! - Grab it! - Okay. Young man! What's going on? - Huh? Oh... I'm moving. I'll get you! How charming. Thank you. I've got him. - Cute! A little crocodile! Nico, give the underpants back! He can keep 'em if he likes 'em. Thanks. Careful. Can you hold him a sec, kid? My name's Tobias! - Okay, okay. I'm Max. You moving in here? - Temporarily. For 2 or 3 weeks. You're pretty curious, aren't you? What floor? - Third. May I? Look... Hold him like this. This is Mickey, a green iguana from South America. Can you help? - Max, you're finally here. Hi, Alex. - Hi, Tobias. - Sorry. Melissa made a scene. He's your new boyfriend! - Crap! I'll miss my flight. We gotta go! Thanks again. Of course you know Mickey! Tobias has it tough. He has to go out when his mother has men around. I give him stuff sometimes. He likes that. Oh well... I'll be in South Africa for 3 weeks. When I get back... - I'll be gone. And... - I'll forget to water the flowers. What else? Come on. - My terrarium's coming too. Wait, my hat! Take care, Mickey. Gimme the bag. No way! No way! I can't believe it! In just five minutes! It's brand new! What about your side? - Nothing. Don't get so upset. This sucks! What kind of place do you live in? Hey, you tidied up! Super! Great! You kissing up again? - He doesn't mean it. You wanna come here? Left or right? - Right! Not so easily... For your birthday, from Fritze and me. Open it! What? Don't you like it? - Sure I do! Super. Nice. Thanks. Go on, tell him! - What? No, not now. Go to your room. We gotta talk here. What's all this crap now? We agreed. C'mere, baby. Baby! Maybe his teacher's right. Maybe I leave him alone too much. I don't think I hear you right! He screws up and you want to take him on a trip? Are you mental? What should I do? - "What should I do?" What the... Is he stupid? Look, this is his thank you! Come here, you little turd! Come here, you little turd! - Forget it. So, you know-it-all... Come on, tell him! Listen up. We're going to the seaside for two weeks. And you're staying here. Don't screw up in school again, or... - There were only 12 candles. Get it? 12! And I'm 13! 13 years old! And I can't play this damned game! The computer is junk, you asshole! No more Mr Nice Guy! We're playing by my rules now. - You've no right! You're not my god-damned father! I'll whip you into shape, even if your mother can't. You can bet on it! And now, my friend, outta here! You prick! You asshole! Damn! - Another word and I'll sick the dog on you, okay? Let me in, you pig! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Want some beer? - No! In this city, I'm so damned alone. Everyone's got a heart of stone. You with your heads of steel and concrete. Son of a bitch. My soul burns with cold and pain, It's the same old story again. I'm scared in the dark tonight. In this loneliness there is no light. Oh, my heart is heavy. A life without love isn't fair. I want to feel something more, In a city with open doors. I see the night disappear And I'll see it many times, I fear. Y'know, I feel so alone. Why can't it just be beautiful? Well? You gonna do it? Right! Since you dad's a teacher, you gotta prove that you're on our side, yeah? So, gentlemen, lot's do to, no time to waste! Let's go! Do it now! There's his stuff! Move it! I can't. Too stupid to pee, or what? Come on! I can't when someone's looking. - Alright. You doing it? Morning, Fred. - Morning, Mr. Feldkamp. We're collecting autographs... No autographs today. Go to school! That's the way it goes! This is trash. Find some innovative ideas, Max. Something moving, something interesting. Maybe new characters. - I'll... keep my eyes open. I'm afraid you'll have to look somewhere else. Good bye. Taxi please. Ms. Kraft. Mr. Feldkamp! Why the long face? Trouble? Show 'em who's boss! Jeez, Fred, if you only knew. Thanks. If I don't find some good stories, I'm out of a job. Come on! Ideas litter the streets! What's up with you? That'd be nice. That's it! - Everybody else went twice! You'll go first the next time. First, clean up with Lukas, Florian, and Daniel. Don't forget to shower! We don't want the classroom stinking. Hey loser, screw up again? Go on and cry. Yeah! Run to mama, son-of-a-whore! My mother's not a... - She isn't? You said you don't have a dad. Yeah, right? - He said it. Must've been a John for 50 an hour. Such a filthy slut! Stop it! She's really nice. She's a hairdresser. - So why doesn't he know his dad? 'Cause... 'cause... - Well, Piggy, why? Lena, forget those monkeys. They're only trying to be macho. Let's go. I know who my dad is, you dickheads. He was abroad for a long time. - Oh yeah? Where? South America. - You're lying. He even brought me something. An iguana. A live one. Great! So you can bring this iguana with you tomorrow. As proof. Get it? I bet he won't bring it. We'll see. Another present... from Felix. Very personal. Felix! Hit him! Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! You again! Stop whining! What happened? You son peed in his shoes. It was really mean. Is it true? - Yes. - Yes. Fourteen... Fifteen... And done. Felix! You know what to do. Here, you can have these. They should fit. I'm sorry. I didn't want to. You can shove your shoes! I don't need any charity! Tobias, stop! - Screw you! You can't go! You'll get in trouble! I don't care. Go away. Leave me be. - I only want to help! Help? You only make it worse! Some help you are! Thanks a lot! My mom says when you stick together that... - Stick together? A loser and a fatty! Great team! - I don't think you're a loser. But I think you are a big, fat sloppy cow! Now go away! It's bad enough without you. You okay? So so. Hey, wait! Someone's been messing with the cars here. - Damn! Um... I mean... about whoever it is. Can you keep an eye out for me? - Sure... "Sure." That means "screw you." You cheated on me! You son of a bitch! You went with someone else! Jeez Louise! I'm outta ideas! " Ideas litter the street." Sure. Mickey! Not that plant! Who is it? - Courier! We have a package for you, but the elevator doesn't work. Okay, I'm coming. Mickey, are you crazy? This means trouble. Big trouble! This is unbelievable! Cool! Does he bite? No, he likes to kiss. Yuck! Who would kiss an iguana? My dad tamed it. This is him? - Yep. That's my dad. Ms. Brecht! - What's going on? - Ms. Brecht! Tobias brought an animal. I'm sure it's poisonous. - Green iguanas aren't poisonous. Not poisonous, but he can bite your balls off! Snip snip! It's from his dad. Here... That's him. This is your dad? Great! Your mother said... He was in South America. - South America? Aha. I'd like to meet him. You can't... He works a lot. - Aha. Pity. Sit down now. We'll do some German forte iguana, and then it's going home. Your dad can't like you much. Mine wouldn't let me out in such messed up clothes. That's what he wants! Mom! Do you really have to go with Fritze? Y'know, if you'd behaved yourself... But, like... Fritze is right. You gotta learn. At least he cares about you. But he hurt me! - Only 'cause you made him mad! Tobias, please. I need Fritze! - But I don't. He's got a job, a car, a nice apartment... Don't ruin it for me. What're you doing? - Mom, I'll never get in trouble again, promise. But please stay here! That's Fritze. Hey, babe! Oops! You won't believe this. Stay. Stay! I got out outside, and this guy was calling "Mickey" into the trash! Totally insane! Hey, kid... So, are you ready? Oh sorry, I didn't mean to. - That's okay, sweetie. Here, this is for food. Don't spend it on comic books again. If you need me, call my cell phone. Take care. What's up, dumb hound! Sit! Sit! Down! Good boy! You have to learn your lesson. Trust me, my dad did the same to me and it didn't do any harm. See ya, little turd! Come on, baby. Come here. Come on! Vacation! Mom, is that you? Have you seen... I found him... in the basement. I was just going to... bring him back. May I? Thanks. Now the most successful soap opera in Germany continues... This is life! This is your heart! Friendship and love, and sometimes pain... This is life! Let's go! Hope and faithfulness as you like it! This is life! At the end of a hard day... Today's specials... Tobias? You shopping, too? Typical woman! - Right. And I won my license in the lottery. That's what it looks like. Ever heard of giving way? This is a surprise! Nice to meet you, Mr... Feldkamp. Max Feldkamp. - Susanne Brecht. I'm Tobias's teacher. Tobias showed us the iguana. South America must be fabulous! Your son showed us your photo. He was so proud! My son? May I have this comic? Please. Please. Please! - Hello, Mrs. Schneider. Yes alright. - Mr. Feldkamp could you come for a talk? Friday, 3 o'clock? Is that OK? Well, I dunno... - Yes, that's fine. - Well? Sure... - Very good. Goodbye. - Yes. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Doesn't "sure" mean "screw you"? Exactly. You owe me an explanation. Say, don't you cook at all? Yeah, when someone makes my blood boil. The world's best omelet! My grandma's recipe. How're the mushrooms? Ready. Like this? Not bad for a beginner. Now the onions. Diced. Can you manage that? - 'Course. Do you cook with Grandma a lot? I can't. She's dead. You don't have to cry. She wasn't your grandma. Why do I always get the stupid jobs? 'Cause I make the plans. Meaning, I get to give the orders. Alright, Mr. Chef! What do you do normally? You got a job? - A job? Sure, why? Most people here don't have one. My mom, for example... She doesn't have one anymore. I see. I write scripts for TV. "This is life!" It's a soap. "This is life?" I always watch it! - So you like it? Yeah, sort of. - Come on, tell me. Spit it out! It's gotten a bit boring lately. But I watch it anyway because I'm used to it. Used to it? - Y'know the people there. It's like they come home to you every night. How're the onions? Cheers! That was a pretty good one! That one too! My mom would be moaning by now. And your dad? What about him? What about your dad? - My dad? He's dead. But it's a long time ago. He died when I was 8. - Oh, I didn't know. It's okay if you don't want to talk about your parents. I don't know my father. I asked mom once. She just said, "For all I care, he can go to hell!" That's why you told your school friends that I'm your dad? Here. You can keep it. It's late. I gotta go home. Thanks forte food. - Thank you, Mr. Chef! Don't forget your groceries. What about Friday? You'll meet my teacher, won't you? Please! Come on, I'll cook you something nice again. Go home! Or your mother will report you missing. Sleep well. - Yes, sure. Sleep better. Yeah? Your dad does "This is Life?" - Yep. So he knows the actors? - Sure. Of course he does. - Awesome! Cool! - He can get us autographs! - Good idea. Great! I'll make a list at school, shall I? - I can ask him. Yes, yes. That's really... Yes, what? No single male tenants? Too messy? Now listen... Wonderful. Me, messy? Unbelievable! You can do it without me! Wait! Hey! "This is Life"... This is life... At the end of a hard day... a beer with your friends. Let's have a drink! "At the end of a hard day." Don't you have a home? Where's your mom? She's coming home later. God, what a mess! - Sorry, I'm working. Ah. So what about our "beer with a friend"? So! Well then, cheers! Get it down your neck! Giving up so soon? Come on! Cheers! There's juice in the fridge. Could you get these? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8! You want so many autographs? I told 'em you work for TV. So? - Sure. No problem. Do you want some, too? Only one: Yannick Masters. My mom likes him, too. I'll give it to her when she's back. - Yannick is so stuck up! He's cool! I always wished my dad were like him. In my imagination. Not for real. Yannick Masters as a dad... Who'd have considered it? What's that? My creative memory. For new ideas and stuff. You just had an idea? - Maybe, maybe... I'm checking out the hammock. If you start missing your kid, buzz the door opposite. Max Feldkamp. You're nicer now that you're dad's around. - Rubbish. No, really! We never used to walk home together. Don't get any ideas, okay? Anyway, I like it better this way. Lena, you're getting on my nerves! Look who's coming. Hey, you two! - Hello, I'm Lena. I live upstairs too. Hello, Lena. So you've got a girlfriend already? Are you crazy? Do you have the autographs? - Autographs? Cool! Sorry, no. I don't have 'em all yet, but... Here. They're cool! For me? Who else? My mom would never buy such expensive shoes for me. He must really love you. Tobias Baumann can take on the world in these shoes! No mountain is too high! See for yourself! Hi, Tobias! Well? Well what? Have you been waiting for me? The meeting with Ms. Brecht is at 3 o'clock. Have you forgotten? Sorry, Tobias. I can't do it. You promised! - I certainly did not. Hey, are you mental? Let me go? - Enough. I want to talk to your mom. Now! How? She's not here, you jerk. Let me go! Hit me! Come on! You can't hurt me. Wait. Come on and hit me. I can take it. I know I was bad. Now I'll be in trouble at school. Where is your mother? Vacation. The beach. With Fritze and his dumb dog. They left you alone? For how long? When are they coming back? In a week. Okay then. Just this week. No more. Then it's your problem, yeah? Yes, sure, sure. Come on. Mr. Feldkamp, I'll be open with you. I think Tobias's problem is his mother. I don't understand. - You know her better, of course. But we think she isn't able to cope with her life. And then having a boy like Tobias... - "A boy like Tobias?" Tobias needs help. He needs someone to care for him, give him stability. We at the school can't give all that to him. - I have to explain, I... Hello, Ms. Brecht. You called... so here we are! What has my offspring been up to this time? Excuse me, Mr. Fleischer. Could you wait outside a moment? Yes... yes... But hurry, I have to be back at the company. Time is money! - Yes, yes. Sorry. Please sit. I don't want to force you into anything regarding Tobias. But I'm sure he told you about our climbing trip. It starts tomorrow morning. You see, it's really important that Tobias goes. Tomorrow morning? How early? You're really coming climbing? No kidding? Your charming teacher said it'd be good for you... and anyway, I don't want any more dents in my car. I didn't mean to dent it... But sometimes... when I get mad this stuff happens to me. About before... I'm sorry. Thanks. It's cooler this way. What did you mean about earlier? I didn't want to hurt you. - It's okay. Hats on and... Wait, wait. Stop! Hold it up. You got it? I think this part goes in here. Stop. Go! A little more here... And this goes here... Right. You got it? There! Fixed, sturdy and strong. Lena, take this to that tent there. To the TV man and... Tobias? - Yes, him too. Being a dad is really hard work! You do it pretty well, considering you're not one. Tobias! I want an autograph from "This is Life!" From Yannick Masters! - Typical girl! You really made us happy with the autograph. Thank you. No problem. Happy to oblige. Here. But not too much. Tomorrow we climb the Falkenstein. You don't think I'm climbing up there? Child's play! I was a mountain ranger. We climbed tougher stuff. That was many potato salads ago! Cheers! - Get it down your neck! I'm going to get another sausage. You want one too? - No. Okay then. It's great that you forgave Felix forte shoe thing. I have new ones now. Anyway, it was all Florian's fault. Tobias. I know about it. Why did you tell everyone that Max is your dad? I'm tired of Florian's stupid comments all the time. Where's your real dad? Left before I was born. I spy with my little eye... And now I have Max. - But if they find out he's not your father... They won't if you shut up! Maybe my mom will like him. She has a boyfriend. - Fritze is a loser. Max is... he talks with me. We go shopping together, and eat together and stuff. - Why does he do it for you? 'Cause... 'Cause... You got it all? - Shh, quiet! Is that why he takes care of you? - Don't tell anyone! You're nice now 'cause it suits you, but Monday at school you'll call me a sloppy cow again! No, I won't. I don't care if you're fat. You don't care... - Really! The loser kisses the sloppy cow! This is the best video ever! Wicked! Tobias! Lena! Where are you? Hey, lovers, smile! You want one on the mouth? Here. You think you're tough 'cause there are 3 of you. Coward. Hit him! - I'm a coward? - Yes! And a big-mouth! - You gonna let him say that? I bet you're too scared to prove you're not a coward. - Wanna bet? Okay, if I win, I get the tape from the camera. And another thing... You have to leave me alone for ever. What's the bet? A fight? No. We climb. At sunrise, when everyone's asleep. - Huh? Climb? What d'you mean? Up the Falkenstein. Just you and me. No rope, no equipment. First to the top wins. Tomorrow morning, at sunrise. And not a word to anyone! Oh, so you finally came home? Can I see? - No. Top Secret! Close the tent. Lights out, and sleep! Max? Could you imagine... Can you imagine having a girlfriend who's a bit chubby? - Yeah. Really? Turn it off! It's nicer to cuddle when there's something there. Yeah, that's true. Good night. You can still give up. This is live ladies and gentlemen! The doomed ones touch the naked stone! They'll give everything they've got! A battle of life and death! - Lukas! Shut up, okay? You quitting already? Tobias! No! Felix, wake your dad! Run, damn it! If you don't come down now, you're in trouble! I'll go bring 'em down. - Alone? Mr. Fleischer, you were a ranger. - Was a while ago. I'll go up there, too. - You? I was in the junior fire brigade. Better than nothing. So, you take your son and I'll get Florian, okay? What do we do now? Keep going? I don't care what you do! Stop that, you asshole! Keep going. Tobias, stop! No further! Tobias! Enough. That's enough now. - Max, be careful! Max! Let's go down now. Come on! Wait! Give me your hand! You crazy? You might have fallen! Me crazy? Are you out of your mind? I had to. I made a bet with Florian. - A bet? I have to go up. - Up there? We're climbing down. Straight down! - No. - Yes we are! If I don't make it Florian will never leave me in peace! Okay, let's go! I'll lead the way. Hey! - What are they doing? I can't believe it! No way! Bravo! The tape. Which one is my father? "Sweetie, I'd drive miles for you." Take your life in your hands. Find the one who loves you. You don't know the rules, so trust your feelings. ...Who's kiss an iguana? Do what you want, but do it now. No kidding, take me seriously. Get your 7-league boots on and walk into this life. Let go of your fears. Take your life in your hands. Find the one who loves you. Believe in yourself. You'll see there's hope. Take your life in your hands. Find the one who loves you. Put on wings and fly. You'll see what's coming. Life should always be like this. That'd be really good. Max? What? Never mind. I was thinking about my mother. It'd be nice if she were here. You miss her, huh? I hate it when she's away. It wasn't so bad before, when my grandma was alive. But later... She sneaks out at night. She thinks I'm asleep, but I always notice, always. It's horrible, horrible... when you wake up and no one's there. No one. I... um... I could talk with her. That'd be cool! Like, if you two would meet. You trying to hook me up? Nah! What do you think? What if my father... the one who made me, had been a muscle man? What would happen? - What do you mean? Will I get muscles like that, too? I think that girls go for that. No way! I'd rather be like you. So, go brush your teeth and then hit the sack. It's late. Don't get too used to me, okay? Hey, Tobias... And copy this down, alright? So that you don't say later, "Oh, I need a title." You mad because you have to do chores forte climbing bet? Do you know how to wash clothes? What goes together, and how hot? - Sure. Anything else? Want to come to the laundromat? We can take your stuff, too. But don't get too used to me. Plus four fifths. Plus. Two fifths? - Yes! Three quarters... "Greetings from the Baltic. Thinking of you. See you soon. Love, mom and..." Fritze. - "...and Fritze." Five o'clock on the sports ground. - Got it. I got a C in math! - Hey, hey, hey! My tutoring! Can I come? - Sorry, we're going somewhere else. That's okay. - For my father. Bye! - Bye. See you tomorrow! Ciao! Please sit down. Sit down! Max? What's it like for grown ups? Do you still miss your parents? - Yes, often. On days like today. And especially Christmas. I know how that is. I always think of my grandma, of how it was when she was alive. Horst and Inge. You come here a lot? - Now and then. I sometimes come here to think. I ask my parents for advice. But like... really quietly so nobody hears. Sounds crazy, right? - No, not to me. Maybe they're here and can hear us. Happy birthday. - From me, too. Will you get a watering can? - Sure! Hello, Tobias. It's me. We're coming back today. About Fritze, well... We had a big fight. That idiot. Jerk... He can go to hell! Why do I always... Damn it! I miss you a lot, you hear? - Stop crying, stupid bitch! Asshole! Right now? Fine, okay. Right. I'll come right away. Children? No. And none planned! Come in! Ah, the street number. Just a moment. 17. Okay, thank you. I'll be right there. Good bye. Yes! My mother's coming home today! - Really? Super! Where are you going? - I might have found an apartment. But you can stay here. There are so many empty apartments. Living in a high-rise isn't for me. I gotta go, the guy's waiting. I won't be long. You can watch TV. Have a shower. You're a bit smelly. Ciao, see you. ...I need time to carry it out. This includes hiring new staff. If that weren't enough, the hospitals say they will need to hire 14,000 new nurses and other personnel. This afternoon in heavy fog, there was a serious traffic accident. The driver lost control of the car while exceeding the speed limit and crashed head-on into an 18-wheeler. The truck driver is in shock. The driver and his young female companion couldn't be saved. Neither was buckled in. And now, sports. Hello? - Hello! Mom? Hello, is someone there? - Yes, it's me! ...you missed me! But you can leave me a message. Bye! Do you know where Tobias is? - Maybe he overslept. I hope he's not sick. Tomorrow we're going to the TV studios. It'd be such a pity! After his cool dad organized everything. Shut up, Florian! Looks like he's out. Maybe at a relative's? Hello. - Hello. Do you live here? - Yes. Do you know the Baumann family? Tobias Baumann? I haven't been here long. If you see him, could you please give him this card? Youth officer. Is he in trouble? Please ask him to call me. That'd be nice of you. I will. - Thank you. Have a nice day. - Bye. You can come out. They've gone. Well? You in trouble again? Are you sick? Are you mad because you've been reading my creative notebook? Can I stay with you? Tobias, I got the apartment. I'm moving out in a week. And the whole family thing just isn't for me, okay? I'm not that kind of guy. People come and go. That's life. It's what you have to learn when you grow up. Here. I'm supposed to give you this. No tears, Tobias. I can't handle it. The tour is starting. Hurry up. Hey, what's with you? You're a bit late! Listen, I have two changes... Hey, Tobias, wait! We have to stay together! - Max! Quiet! Thank you. That was good, but could be better. Hey, you were good. Yannik, when you're acting helpless, it has to be clearer, yes? Once more! Costumes, make-up! Hurry up! Starting positions! - Back up, please! Beginning! Come on, kids! Let's go! Back to the top, please! Once more, the whole thing again. So, monitor! Rolling! 97/6! Take seven. Please! You have to understand. People come and go. That's life. Go brush your teeth and off to bed. One more thing... Don't get too used to me, okay? You asshole! You stole my life! Excuse me! Tobias, wait! Tobias! Please, I can explain everything! You just used me for your story! You don't really care about me! That's not true! - Oh sure, not at all! Tobias, I'll talk to your mom, okay? Yeah? - Yes. - How? She's not coming back. Never. Neither of you care about me. She's happier dead than being here with me! Tobias, wait! I didn't mean to use you! What do you mean, "She's happier dead?" Don't you watch the news? Tobias! Lord, watch over and protect you. The Lord will show you his true face He will look at you and give you peace. Amen. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen. Here. It's not so clean, but... Have a seat. - Thank you. His teacher told me that you were a sort of stand-in father for Tobias. Could you imagine taking care of him? How would that work? I'm single right now and... If the conditions are right, it's possible. And anyway... Tobias has reached an age where he can legally have a say. He thinks you're the only person he has left. He told me that he likes you. But... you must decide. One day before I met Tobias I broke up with my girlfriend. She wanted to get married. Marry and have children. But I can't imagine myself with the responsibility of a family. No problem. Tobias is a great kid. I think he deserves something better. I'd like to go to a children's home. It's okay. I can't do it, Tobias. There's no way. Can you please go now? Felix wanted to come too. I thought it'd be better to come alone. So, how is it here? - Lots of fresh air and greenery. It's okay. The teachers are nice. I got some new things. I saw. Cool! Florian would look twice. He says hi, too. Really. He says it's boring now with no one to tease. Idiot! What about the others? He moved out a couple of months ago. Has he called you yet? People come and go. Max says that's the way life is. And I have to learn it. Lena? Come in! Hello. - Here, for you. But you must promise me that you'll never tell Tobias. He thinks I threw it in the campfire. And what is it? - I have to go. Bye. - Wait! Here. Cookie. Merry Christmas! Let's have a look, Mickey. But why does he do it for you? - 'Cause... 'Cause... I used to imagine what it'd be like to have a dad. But with Max... it's even better. - Why? - Why? 'Cause Max doesn't have anyone, not really. That's why he takes care of me, and I take care of him. Then we're both less lonely. But the best part is that he loves me. You got it all? - Shh, shut up! The loser kisses the sloppy cow! This is the best video ever! Great! Now we continue with the Christmas special of "This is Life," Germany's most successful soap! Merry Christmas. Thanks. It's beautiful, so sad. Girls' stuff! It's nice. I know I really hurt you. And I never noticed. This is life! This is your heart! Friendship and love, and sometimes pain... This is life, let's go... Where are you going? - Leave me alone. I have to think. This is life... I'm sorry to bother you so early. Could I speak with Tobias Baumann? Good morning. - Who are you? I am... Um, I was... Tobias's father... for a week. I'll wake him. - Tobias has a dad? That's news to me. Right! It's so new that he doesn't know yet either. Come in. - Thanks. Tobias is gone. - What? Where could he be? - He was upset by "This is Life" yesterday. But he wouldn't run away because of a TV show! - Maybe he would. He said he had to think things over. Think things over? I think I know where he is! I guess you're surprised that I came to you. I went to my mother first, but I don't know if she can help. It's funny talking to someone who isn't there. Alright. I want to ask you a favour. It's about Max. Max doesn't think he can be a good dad. But I think he can. Really! A really good one. At least to me. About the TV show thing... I'm not mad any more. I guess you don't have TV up there. Come with me. Where to? Home. Your parents work fast! Thank you! One more thing: No more trouble! - Sure, sure... "This is Life" was totally kitsch last night. - Oh really? I have a new idea, by the way. A love story. Let's say Tobias, I mean Kevin, falls in love with his best friend. What could we call her? Maybe... Lena? Subtitles Jeffrey A.
