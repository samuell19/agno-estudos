NETFLIX PRESENTS It's him! Valentín Esparza? We just want to talk to you, all right? Stop! Freeze! - Freeze! - Stop! - Stop right there! - Stop! - Hey! - Hey! Stop! Hey! Don't move! Hey! - Stop! - Fucking stop! Where did he go? - Where? - That way! Valentín! Hey! Stop! Hah! Freeze! Jonan, the backpack! Don't move. Don't move. Your arm! I have to finish this. I must finish it. I must finish this. I must finish this. I must finish it. OFFERING TO THE STORM NAVARRE POLICE May I sit? I get exhausted around this time. I had a baby five months ago, and I can barely sleep. Babies really do change your life, don't they? Sometimes, I'm not surprised that some parents lose their minds. - How old was your daughter, Valentín? - Four months. Where were you taking her? I just wanted to keep her for a bit longer. Your mother-in-law says you went to her place at night. She heard a noise, opened a window and saw you fleeing. She couldn't stop crying when she told us. She's a liar. She's not lying, though, when she says the baby's body had a mark on her forehead that wasn't there when she put her to sleep. A pressure mark from an object, an exact match to this stuffed toy's eye. My mother-in-law is a huge bitch. You saw the mark too, Valentín. So you covered it with makeup, and asked for the casket to be closed early. But the bitch wasn't giving up. That's why you took the body, right? No, that was because they wanted to cremate her. - You wanted a burial. - She mustn't be cremated. I must finish it. What is it you must finish, Valentín? If I don't... this will all be for nothing. What's all this for? Did you kill your daughter? No. I did not kill her. I delivered her. To whom? Whom did you deliver her to? What for? Tell them not to cremate her. Please. No cremation. To whom? Whom did you deliver her to? His lips are moving, but I can't tell what he's saying. What for? Goñi, see what you can do about the audio. Actually, find someone who can read lips. Yes, Chief. Someone fix the coffee machine, please. - Who's in charge? - I'll take care of it. SALAZAR BAKERY There's no way Mom made it out of the river alive. I spoke to the judge in charge of the case in Pamplona. - He agrees to a funeral. - You called Judge Markina? No, he called me. He's lovely, by the way. I spoke to Father Germán, too. We decided Friday would be best. - "We"? - Yes. The sooner this is over, the better for us all. We can't presume her dead without a body. Don't be absurd. Her coat was found in the river over a month ago. That's a decoy! - It doesn't mean squat. - I think it's a good idea, Amaia. We have to move on. I don't think she's dead. Where is she, then? Alone, at night, an old lady who can barely walk. She's not an old lady who can barely walk. It doesn't matter! Give it a rest. Mom is dead. Let me know if you need help with the preparations. Fine. Amaia... You didn't see her, James. She escaped. She came to this house, she took our child. She wasn't a feeble old woman. She was a determined woman. I was there. Yeah, and I wasn't. I know. But then why hasn't she appeared, Amaia? The water swept her away. The police said so, your colleagues, - even your fucking friend the judge. - I don't care, I don't believe it. Exactly. That's the problem. Have you stopped to think about what others feel? About your sisters? About maybe they need to put an end to this whole fucking thing? I know you've suffered a lot, Amaia, but you're not the only one. I got it. Hey, buddy. I know, buddy. There's nothing wrong with having a funeral service. I'm certainly gonna go, and I hope you come with me. - Amaia, honey. - Not now, Auntie, please. Please. Hey. PAMPLONA I PENITENTIARY CENTER I'm but the stage director of a play that has many actors. Oh, really? The footage of your escape shows a pretty docile stage director. Obeying an old lady. Lot of good it did you. You're in jail, and she's missing. Nice stage direction. You're wrong, Detective. Apart from the surprise of the baby being a boy, it all went according to plan. Where did you get the arm you left in the church? - Did Rosario tell you? - I don't know what you mean. When you visited Baztan, you didn't stay at your father's house or at a hotel. I believe you have a safe house my mother went to when she left the cave. Where is that house? She's alive, isn't she? What do you think? That you had an escape plan and she used it. One must be smart to value intelligence. We've seen each other, you and I. Just for that, I'll give you a gift. Listen closely. It's a message from your mother. Sleep with one eye open, little bitch. Because sooner or later, your mother... will eat you. Open the gate! Open the gate! Can't you hear me? Open up! He attacked your weakness. There's no message from your mother. He had control over the guards. - It was like they were dogs. - Where are you? - Tell me where you are, I'll be there. - Call the warden, tell him to isolate him. Certainly. Amaia, I'm so sorry about what happened. Let's meet tonight. I'll pick you up. You must warn the warden as soon as possible. - I have to go, someone's calling. - All right, don't worry. Yes, Jonan. We placed the bouquets and the flowers carefully. And today everything had been moved. It's a mess. The keeper says the gravestone has been moved. Wait here. This one's been moved, ma'am. It's empty. Tell the prison we'd like to speak to Valentín Esparza. We should have buried her by the house. And you should stop going after flesh-and-blood murderers. Our dear girl was murdered by Inguma. Chief. - Yes? - Valentín Esparza's been murdered. What? His cellmate stabbed him out of the blue. He was a quiet prisoner. No one knows what happened. And the interrogation footage? The sound is patchy. I've checked with a speech therapist. "I delivered her to Inguma, like many other sacrifices." Play it again. "I delivered her to Inguma, like many other sacrifices." Inguma. One of the oldest demons in mythology. It kills people in their sleep, and causes sudden infant death, putting its mouth over theirs and drinking their breath until they die. Let me see. Thanks, Goñi. When I saw that empty casket, I could only think of my sister's. This time, they didn't bother with the gravel. We'll investigate every sudden infant death in the valley in the past five years. Right. Elena? It's Amaia Salazar. It's the same symbols the master traced when we sacrificed animals, but... I don't know their meaning. Elena, I know my mother is alive. She's hiding somewhere. I must find the place where you gathered, the house you told me about. It's very important that you answer me. I beg you. Did they ever do human sacrifices? Can't you see, Amaia? If I talk, they'll kill me. Who will? Who will? I'll protect you. - You can't protect me from this. - Please. Please, answer me. Did they sacrifice people? Back in the day, your mother was the only pregnant woman in the group. If you're alive, then it was all nonsense. I thanked God thousands of times whenever I saw you in town. Elena, I had a sister. A twin sister. She died of crib death. - Where is your sister buried? - I don't know. - I found her grave, but it was empty. - No! - Please... Elena... - Leave my house! - Leave my house right now! - Please! It's really important! - Listen to me. - Get out. At least tell me where the bodies were. What did you do with them? Please. Elena, please! Please! Get out of my house! PAMPLONA PRISON Hey. Are you okay? It's my father. He just called. He has a lesion on his heart. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. They have to do an emergency bypass. They'll give him the date tomorrow, but... - I'll leave after the funeral. - Of course. I'll finish up everything I've gotta do here tomorrow and then look into tickets. He was isolated. Since your visit, he hadn't spoken to anyone. An officer saw he wasn't moving and raised the alarm, and we found him like that. No signs of petechiae, self-defense injuries, or suffering. Judging by the amount of foaming in the mouth, I reckon he took something that caused heart failure. Dr. Berasategui did not want to die. Suicide does not fit in with narcissistic behavior. What do you mean, he didn't want to die? How would you know that? He cried as he perished. He lied down and mourned himself in a burst of self-pity. Stop. Click on camera five. There, he handed him something. Click on nine. Amaia. Your Honor. Did something happen? You left without telling me how you're doing. I'm all right, thank you. Remember, I'm here for whatever you need. - Thank you. - I care about you, Amaia. I just wanted to say that my feelings for you haven't changed. And they will never change. Your Honor. Did you call my sister Flora to support my mother's funeral? I told her it was a good idea, yes. But she's the one who called me. Did you visit Dr. Berasategui in jail? On three occasions. Did he tell you about Rosario's escape and the events of that night? I tried each time, Detective, but he changed the subject. I believe my mother is in hiding. And that this is all part of a much more complex plan. I'm glad you're beginning to understand, Salazar. Could there be a link between the ancient practices of witchcraft in the valley and the events in this cave? It is said that witches eat children, feeding on the life force of sacrificed innocents. What would they gain? Good health. Life. Material wealth. Does anyone still believe that? Stop questioning whether it makes sense. Do not judge, and accept that if something has real consequences, it's real. And why children? How did they use them? They must be under two years old. Up to that age, they exist in two worlds, and they can see and hear what occurs in both. There's a ritual to kill them. They're often bled out. Sometimes, they're also dismembered, to be used bit by bit. The skull and the longest bones are the most valuable. Some rituals use nails, hair, teeth, and the dust from crushing up their smaller bones. If a body was stolen for sacrifice, where would they take it? To a place that's magical, safe, and guarded. I know you're thinking of temples or churches, Detective, but witchcraft is not Satanism. Offending God is not the goal. It's to summon and worship the spirits. - What spirits? - Aker. For instance. - That's what you call the demon in Baztan. - Do you believe that, Father? Again, that's the wrong question, Detective. It's not about belief. It's about the power behind it. What matters are the real consequences, and that there are people willing to die and kill for them. Sonia said Valentín wouldn't shut up about traditions and the power of earth. He asked her to give birth at home, but the girl was born prematurely at the hospital. Did she mention a midwife? She didn't, but I'll talk to her. It's Iriarte. In the past seven years, there've been five cases of crib death in Baztan, and Social Services investigated three of them. Ask them what caught their attention and how the families reacted. Sure. Attention, all units to Padre Donostia Avenue. Over. That's by the bakery. Seal all entrances, please. All right. Montes, what happened? It's the body of a woman. Her daughter found her. She came from Pamplona because she wasn't answering the phone. The doctor said something seems off. - I'll be right there. - Bring the ladder to climb the gate. All right, let's get to work. Roger. Detective. At first it looked like internal bleeding led to collapsed lungs. But look. Her vomit has all these tiny bits of walnut shell in it. Sharp as razor blades. They must have pierced her stomach, duodenum and trachea, and they wreaked havoc when she threw them back up. It's an awful way to take your own life. My mother would never kill herself. Besides, she hated walnuts. She was terrified of them. As a kid, she made me swear not to touch them. Was her behavior strange lately? This past month, she seemed very nervous. Paranoid. But I couldn't get anything out of her. Thank you. You're Rosario's girl, aren't you? I've seen my mother weep so many times because of her... This is Aloisius Dupree. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. Aloisius... all the people implicated are dying. I think there is someone who is creating a firewall around me. Please call me when you can. Where were you? I've been worried all day. I'm here now. I called you several times, and you didn't pick up. At six in the evening? After the whole day? - What's wrong, James? - You tell me. I don't know. They're operating on my father on Monday. I booked tickets for the three of us to the States on Saturday. Come with Ibai and me, Amaia. Take a few days off. It'll be good for you to get away from everything and everybody. I'll do it. Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's all right. When I went to bed, I... I moved the pillow and... and I found this. It's for you. I guess they were right and... the poor woman did kill herself. It's just the location of a place she used to go to with my mother. That's all. They know. I told you they'd find out. No one can protect you from them. Something is eating away at my insides, I can feel it's killing me, and there's no point in hiding it anymore. It's a big old rundown house, with dirty walls and a dark roof. It's on the Orabidea Road. It can't be seen from above, but you'll get a glimpse of it where the road turns. It's a dark house, and not because of its color, but because of what's inside. If you are who you claim to be, and you survived the fate they had in store for you, whether you look for them or not won't matter. Sooner or later, they'll find you. May God help you. - Good morning. How may I help you? - Morning. I'm looking for an old house. It could be that one down there, - but it looks quite new... - I don't know about any houses. It's important that you help me, please. Are you investigating that scum? I am. Have you ever seen any of these people down there? I've seen that man many times, yes. Never seen those two sourpusses in my life, though. - Could you tell me your name, please? - Ana Mari Ezkurra. Have you lived here long? Ask them about Ainara. Ainara is the only name that matters. Hurry! Wait! Good morning. I'm Detective Salazar, from the Homicide Department. - Do you own this house? - We do, why? I have some bad news. Your friend Dr. Berasategui has passed away. How did you know him? Our relationship is protected by professional secrecy. - If you'll excuse us... - Sorry, one last question. Did you ever see Dr. Berasategui with this woman? We've never seen her. - Anyone else in the house? - Detective. You have just told us someone very dear to us has died. We need time to process it. If you have more questions, talk to our lawyer. The poor woman died from ingesting sharp foreign objects. And I assure you it wasn't voluntarily. Someone forced her to swallow walnut shell bits until her insides were torn apart. Once she was dead, they forced more shells down her throat till her intestines burst. Thank you, Doctor. - Chief, we have the birth certificate. - Good. Ainara Martínez Batón, December 11th, 1977. She's the owners' daughter. She was born at home, in Argi Beltz. The midwife was Fina Hidalgo. Shit. I can't find her death certificate anywhere, though. - "Argi Beltz" means "Black Light." - Yes, Montes. We spoke to the families investigated by Social Services. When their babies died, they were perfectly normal people. But now, they're all loaded. Pharmaceutical companies, real estate, a law firm... Life has treated them well. They've had the devil's own luck. One of the lawyers had terminal cancer, and now she's fit as a fucking fiddle. - What's her name? - Karmele Andía. She's a partner at Lejarreta and Andía. Berasategui, my mother, Elena Ochoa... The common denominators are the house, that group of people, and a couple of wealthy lawyers from Pamplona. I think they lost a daughter too. Did you find anything alarming in the reports from Social Services? No. Did you find a direct link between those families? No, but it could be a nurse called Fina Hidalgo. She delivered every child, including my sister. She admitted to killing newborns to my face. "It could be." You're not sure. I can't prove it. Did anyone else hear the midwife admit to the murders? No. Javier, please, I need your help. I need to go inside Argi Beltz. I need the midwife's files. If the girls' death certificates are there, we'll have to exhume their bodies. I'll issue a search warrant for the files. But what you're asking, Amaia... Please. It is true that the midwife's behavior is suspicious. But you haven't found a link that connects all those people. Bring me something solid, Amaia. I will. Is everything okay? When I was 12, my mother got pregnant again. My parents were over the moon. Everything went smoothly, the baby was born healthy. But three weeks later, my brother died. From that moment on, my mother would only speak to ask about her baby. She went mad with grief. She even tried to take her own life, and she was moved to a facility. She died two years later. I will not dig up a grave... to unearth so much suffering. Unless you bring me a witness who saw a child murdered by her parents, an examiner's statement retracting their report, and new evidence. Otherwise, no, I will not authorize a baby's disinterment. How did you move on? Through forgiveness, Amaia. I forgave my mother, my father, my baby brother. Even myself. You should try it. What's so funny? It feels good to tell you. I'd never told anybody. I'm counting on the search warrant. You won't stop, will you? Never. Detective Salazar, I'm going to kiss you. You shouldn't. You shouldn't do that. What time's this to be arriving home, young lady? How is your father? He's cheerful. So, you staying with us? I need to do something, and then I come back. - Okay? - Okay. Amaia. Have you asked for the time off yet? Yes, but they still haven't answered. Okay. - Don't be long. - No. Are you sure you don't want some bread with that? I'm sure, Auntie. Oh, my girl... This way. The patient files are in the cabinets. The certificates and protocols are... - They're gone. - There's nothing. Let's go. What a terrible coincidence. It says you're here for those files, and yesterday I felt like cleaning up. - Where are the certificates? - Your visit reminded me that they were just gathering dust, - so I threw them away. - What did you do with them? What you do with useless paper. - Chief! - A proper fire. It's all burnt. The ashes have been crushed. You don't seem like a lucky woman. Let's go. Amaia. Amaia! I want the names of everyone who knew we were coming, and a list of outgoing calls from the station, personal phones too. - Are you accusing us? - Someone was careless, clearly. - This warrant was not confidential. - I discussed it earlier. It's not exactly a drug plantation. We were coming for some files. Let's not blow it out of proportion. I want a name as soon as I come back. I've shown these photos to the police many times. The people there are just weird. About 40 years ago, this one couple was always butt naked. They kept animals and always had huge gatherings. They burned strong-smelling weeds, and we would hear shrieking. It was like a slaughterhouse. Ainara was their daughter. She was a bit over a year old. They didn't pay any attention to her or feed her. She was always filthy and alone. - They didn't feed their own daughter? - I made rosquillas one day. The poor starved girl smelled them and came all the way here. That's her. We gave her some with milk, and she devoured them so voraciously. I thought she'd choke. Her parents still own the house, but... they're not hippies anymore. Now, they're filthy rich. They're always getting visitors in fancy cars, with bodyguards. I wouldn't be surprised to see the president. What about Ainara? One night, I took them some of my daughters' used clothes, and when I got there... a bunch of people were celebrating something. I asked about Ainara, and they said she'd died of a stroke. The child was dead, and they seemed so happy. They didn't even hold a funeral. They said it happened during a trip to England and she was buried there. Do you remember seeing this woman in the house? Countless times. She still comes by. Thank you so much. Your testimony will be very helpful. It's a bit too late. You be careful, girl. Witches and the devil can't be killed with bullets. Excuse me. Excuse me. Just a second, please. Please! Hey! Wait. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Let go of me, murderer! - Stop! - I know my rights. - Stay still! - Murderer! I'm police. I just want to talk to you. Okay? I want to know why you were taking pictures. Because those people... killed my babies. I never wanted children. My husband did. But when they were born and I saw their tiny faces... What's your husband's name? He's French. We're still married. Although... Now he lives in our house in Ainhoa with some random whore. What's his name, Yolanda? Marcel Tremond. At first he was so kind to me, but he met the people in that house while I was pregnant, and everything went to shit. - Did he suggest a home birth? - Yes, indeed. "The old way," he'd say. We ruled it out when we learned we were having twins. How did they die? Crib death. Both on the same night. I cried so much, I thought my throat was being torn apart. I'll admit I lost it. From losing them and... And for what my husband did when we buried them. What did he do? He took the bodies. That's what he did. He said everything would be okay after their deaths. He wanted their little caskets closed, but I opened them. And there was nothing but towels and sugar packets. I told him I didn't believe our babies were in their grave, and I wanted it open, but... The mausoleum in Ainhoa belongs to his family, and he refused. Then her husband was always away. She followed him, took pictures, and he'd always go to the house. Just curious, Chief, how did you get there? Looking for my mother. Goñi, we need to pick up several memory cards from Yolanda. I'll talk to her. Her husband's companies are represented by the Pamplona firm. - Everything fits. - Not everything. It's the first case of siblings dying at the same time. And boys, instead of girls. Besides, a judge might deem her bitter, trying to get back at her husband. I know, Montes, but it's all we have. Let's get the autopsy reports. Markina won't let us open a child's grave without proof. But, Chief, Ainhoa is in France, outside of Markina's jurisdiction. Let's move. Chief, I just... Yes? We're all working our asses off for those girls, for all of them. - What do you mean? - We're on your fucking side. We're not a bunch of sloppy snitches. AINHOA, FRANCE All right, noted. Chief, Yolanda's sons died in the hospital where they were born. As far as we know, there was no autopsy. Come on. POLICE Yes, hello? Yes, that's me. TREMOND-BOURGAUD FAMILY That's me. Stop! Wait a second. All right. Thanks for letting me know. Is there a problem, Your Honor? The judge in charge of the case has refused to authorize this. But that's for a different case, it's unrelated. Listen to me. Never. Do you know that word? Never call me again. I will not collaborate, is that clear? Put it back. No! No! My babies. No, my babies... No! Javier, please, let me explain. JUDGE MARKINA This is Aloisius Dupree. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. You're back early, dear. How nice. Hi, honey. Cleanse the river, Amaia. Wash off the offense... You should dry your hair. You'll catch a cold. How long have I been asleep? Well, Ibai is at college already and, uh... You know? You wanna tell me what's going on? The case has got really complicated. And I made a terrible mistake. I betrayed a judge. And now, I don't know what's going to happen. Markina? You know... sometimes, it's better to give up today in order to fight tomorrow. Whatever happens, I'll be by your side. I know. I always know that. It'll do you good to get away for a few days, switch off. Tomorrow I will go with you to Rosario's funeral. And then we'll go together to see your father. Okay. Iriarte, what's wrong? Around midnight, Mrs. Yolanda Berrueta blew up her children's grave to check if they were inside. Yes. Apparently, she found some old explosives that hadn't been disposed of, er, in the mines that belong to her family. The explosives were detonated, but they didn't go off. So, she approached to check what had gone wrong, and they blew up in her face. The blast destroyed two of her fingers and another two were found on the opposite vault. She has also... lost an eye. I'm very sorry, but if the judge finds out I told you... Don't worry, Gaspar. See you soon. Thanks for everything. I owe you a big one. Despite her injuries, the woman managed to crawl to the grave and get close enough to look inside. JANUARY 1905 Your Honor? I'll be there. My ex-wife has always been very fragile. She was careless during her pregnancy. She would smoke, drink... She took tranquilizers, weight loss pills... The boys were born with respiratory issues, and she felt very guilty. She tried to kill herself twice. We convinced her to come to our clinic. They're not just Yolanda's in-laws. Lisa is the Head of Pediatrics at the hospital where the boys were born and died. If you have any questions, Detective, now is the time. Why didn't you perform an autopsy? It's protocol for SIDS. It wasn't SIDS. It was caused by pulmonary insufficiency that was present from birth. Besides, she outright refused. "Do not slit my babies open," she said. Yolanda was on very strong medication. She mixes up dates, situations... She gets confused, Detective. What's your relationship with the lawyers Lejarreta and Andía? They are our counselors and our friends. Did they introduce you - to the Martínez-Batóns? - They did. What is the nature of the meetings you held with Dr. Berasategui? The doctor led a support group for parents who had lost a child. We were shocked to hear about the charges against the doctor. He was always exemplary with us. Thank you so much. You have been very kind. I'll walk you out. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. What should I do with you, Detective? Calling the French judge was a mistake. I thought I'd find a new line of investigation. Why didn't you come to me, Amaia? - Now I'm Amaia again? - I give you everything you ask for. And as soon as you can, you treat me like I'm nobody. How did the search of the files go? Badly. Someone warned the midwife, and she burned everything. Do you suspect someone from the station? Be careful if you make accusations. You could cause great pain. I'm leaving for a few days, Javier. I have personal matters to attend to and... I need to take a step back from everything. Everything? The investigation. Should I take you to the station or home? Drop me off at the church. I don't get why you're attending your mother's funeral. You know she's not dead. I don't know anything, Jonan. - I might be wrong about this too. - No. There's messing up, and there's giving up. They're different. I didn't just mess up. I made a mistake that almost cost someone her life. She's insane, Amaia. Markina can't hold you responsible. We wouldn't have called the French judge if he had supported you. - I shouldn't have gone over his head. - You're making a mistake. You're not being objective, Chief. You taught me that gut feelings are essential to investigators. You have to make mistakes, get up, press on, find new clues. Fight, like soldiers. But today you're going against everything you taught me. I can't think, Jonan. I don't want to mess up again. The coat was a decoy. We know your mother isn't dead, no matter what they say. I also believe someone tipped off the midwife. - And the judge... - What? You're blinded by personal involvement. How dare you? I dare because I care. I'd never let my personal life affect an investigation. Don't start today. Get the hell out of here. - Auntie. - Hello. - Weren't you at the funeral? - I almost went. You can't go to someone's funeral if you believe they're alive. I'm no phony, Amaia. Besides, I can't bring myself to pray for her soul. She tried to kill Ibai and almost killed me. I might be pious, but... I'm not a dumb-ass. What do you know about witchcraft in the valley, Auntie? A century ago, believing in witches was more common than believing in the Holy Trinity. Could anyone be summoning those forces now? Oh, dear. My logic-loving child discussing witchcraft in the 21st century. - Auntie, they're killing babies. - As sacrifices. Evil offerings. Someone's trying to awaken minor gods. Honey... I read the cards yesterday, and I saw something scary. What? They told me that a good friend of yours is in danger. Apparently, they've come for him. Aloisius. No, we have not heard from Agent Dupree for several days. He did not send the report he said he was going to send, and he hasn't called us, either. He told me he was investigating a dangerous case. Do you think it could be connected? He was investigating control groups and, um... Yeah, we suspect he could've been captured. But I can't tell you anything more. What do you mean when you say "control groups"? I'm talking about sects, Amaia. But I can't tell you anything more. Soon as he gets in touch, I'll let you know, I promise. Thank you. The service was beautiful. And so many people! The entire town. María Rosa sends her regards, Auntie. She wants to meet soon. All right. Of course. So, since we're all here, there's something I'd like to tell you. If Amaia can put her phone down, that is. It's important. Just for a minute. The world can go on without you. CALL ME WHEN YOU... I wanted to say I'm seeing someone. Actually, we got back together. His name is Fermín. Amaia knows him well. - He works for her. - Montes. Himself. - If it makes you happy, Flora... - Yes. He says you're leaving for a few days. Yes, I already told you. Excuse me, I have to make a call. The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Flora's moving back to Elizondo. She wants Rosa's share of the bakery. That's why they were arguing. What's wrong, Amaia? I'm fine, it's just that... I feel... a little bit on edge. Can I do anything? No, it's okay. Hello? Detective Salazar? - Yes. - I'm Deputy Inspector Etxaide's mother. I'm sorry to call, I'm just a bit worried. Is my son with you? No. No, Jonan left for Pamplona this morning. I'm in Elizondo. Did something happen? He said he'd come home for lunch at one, but I haven't heard from him. He always calls and his phone is off. Don't worry.Uh... I'm sure he's with a colleague. I'll call you right back. I'll make a call or two and get back to you. - Don't worry. - Thank you, Amaia. This is Jonan Etxaide's voicemail. Leave a message. Bye. Jonan, it's Amaia. Please call me as soon as you can. - Yes, Chief? - Fermín. Jonan's mother called me. She's worried, she can't reach him. Don't fret. I'll call Goñi. He lives nearby, he'll check. He probably fell asleep with his phone on silent. Yes, please do that. What's going on? Amaia. Amaia, what's going on? Uh... I have to leave. Where are you going? - What's wrong, Amaia? - I'll be right back. - Montes... - Chief, Etxaide was at home. Goñi found the front door open. - And? - Shit, Amaia, he was lying on the floor. He's been shot. God. Let's go. What did Goñi say, exactly? He was about to ring the bell when he saw the door was slightly open. He went in and found him on the floor. How many times was he shot? Where? I don't know. He had just walked in when we spoke. - Call him. - I did, he's not picking up. Shit, then call again. No answer. - What hospital is he in? - No, he's at home. - At home, why? - No idea. They might be stabilizing him. Pull over. - Make way! - Excuse me. Why is Dr. San Martín's car here? Come in, come in. - Let me through. - You shouldn't. - Let me through! - Don't. - Let me! - Please don't! Please! - Please, please! - Let me! Let me go. FORENSICS Oh, no. No... No, no, no! I'm sorry. Don't touch him. No! Forgive me. Forgive me... Forgive me, Jonan. God, no. Would you like someone to escort you home, Detective? If any of you can't bear to be here, you may leave. I'm Chief of Homicide for a reason. They'll get us off the case soon, so please take pictures of everything. Before we're kicked out. - Of course, Detective. - Yes, Chief. IRACHE FUNERAL HOME James. Don't go, please. Stay with me. I can't, Amaia. I have to be there. I know, uh... I don't know why I say that. It's just that it's... it's so hard. I know. I know. - I love you. - I love you. I love you both. So we'll see you soon, okay? The killer used IMI 9mm subsonic ammo with a silencer. That's why the neighbors didn't hear a sound. It looks like Etxaide knew his attacker. He opened the door, let them in... and went inside with them. That's why his body was on the far end of the room. And it doesn't look like your average robbery. There was no mess, and they only took his laptop, his camera, hard drives and memory cards. And the gun. A clean gun is more valuable than money to a hitman. Detective Clemos has just sent the autopsy report. I can't stand that jerk. If he doesn't start communicating in writing, I might just punch him. According to this, he was shot in the torso and the forehead. AUTOPSY DIAGRAM MALE The first trajectory indicates the murderer was sitting down... SKULL GUNSHOT WOUND or on their knees. A hitman would not shoot first from such a low angle. Maybe they shot again to be sure, but according to the report, the first one would have killed him. What do you mean? That they shot again to put him out of his misery. - It was mercy. - For fuck's sake, Salazar. A bullet in the head, merciful? It is if you don't want to cause more pain than necessary. And you know that just because they shot him again? That... and they closed his eyes. ♪ Requiem ♪ ♪ Aeternam ♪ ♪ Dona eis ♪ I'm sorry. ♪ Domine ♪ - ♪ Aeternam ♪ - I'm sorry. ♪ Et lux ♪ ♪ Perpetua ♪ ♪ Luceat eis ♪ Detective. Thank you for coming. Please, call me Amaia. Jonan appreciated you and respected you dearly. - I felt the same about him. - ♪ Perpetua ♪ ♪ Luceat ♪ ♪ Eis ♪ Internal Affairs has detected that Etxaide accessed your personal laptop remotely and often to back up files and e-mails. Yes, of course he did. He was my assistant. He had full access. Right, but they say he accessed your personal laptop on the day we visited the midwife, and he could have warned her. That's impossible. Montes. Did he really access your laptop without authorization? Etxaide knew my every move. He didn't need authorization. Not even to check your personal e-mail? Maybe he just accessed it to install an antivirus or some such bullshit. Amaia. I'm Marc. Jonan's husband. Marc. I didn't know Jonan was married. Don't worry about it. You know he kept to himself. But he spoke of you often. I'll catch them, Marc. I swear. That wouldn't bring him back. No. He knew, Amaia. Jonan knew he was in danger. Did he say anything? He feared for his life. He left you a message. - What message? - Not a message per se, but around two weeks ago, he said that he was working on something, and if he couldn't give it to you, I should. - What was it? - One word. He said you'd know how to use it. "Offering." "Offering and his number." Is that it? He said he trusted you more than anyone. And if he couldn't give it to you, I should remember that. "Offering and his number." Amaia. Your Honor? Why are you here? I'm so sorry. - Thank you. - Would you like to get a drink? I know the perfect spot. Yes. I didn't picture you as a whiskey drinker. Me in particular, or any woman at all? I didn't picture Detective Salazar. Something about it... numbs the pain. At the same time, it keeps your mind sharp. I attended an Irish funeral once. Instead of grieving their friend's death, they... celebrated the life he had. According to local legend, funerals were three days long to make sure the deceased wasn't faking their own death, since no Irishman can resist three days of whiskey and partying with friends and not rise from their grave. Thank you. I never saw Jonan drink. I saw him have a beer once. It was alcohol-free, I think. When I first met him, I thought... he was a smartass. Bordering on conceited. Then I realized... he just wanted to impress me. A few days later, I saw him take statements from these abused children and I realized he was a prodigy. One of the... good ones. And caring. I called the Commissioner that day and told him not to dare take him away from me. In just a few weeks, he became indispensable. Did you ever tell him? James. Amaia, the surgeon just came out. He... he told us everything went perfectly. Oh, that's great. The only problem we have now is that someone here really misses you. Huh? Isn't that right, Ibai, huh? You miss your ama? Listen, we're gonna grab something to eat before my dad wakes up. I... I just wanted to give you a call and let you know, okay? Of course. Thank you. Give them a kiss from me, okay? Sure, I'll do that right now. - I love you. - I love you. NEW E-MAIL FROM JONAN ETXAIDE YOU HAVE 1 NEW E-MAIL TIMED DELIVERY FROM JONAN ETXAIDE THE USER WOULD LIKE TO SHARE FILES AND IMAGES ENTER THE PASSWORD OFFERING Iriarte, what's Jonan's badge number? OFFERING1269 Thank you. JONAN ETXAIDE'S PRIVATE DRIVE Oh, shit, Jonan. Yolanda's father has confirmed that a year before the twins' birth, she had a daughter, Haizea, who suffered a crib death. It drove Yolanda to depression and madness. The judge won't let us inspect the grave. It wouldn't do us any good. Her husband had the slab closed the day after the explosion. What a dick. Right, the deceased babies were all from towns adjacent to the Baztan River. Fina Hidalgo, the midwife, is the only link between the cases. She also worked in Gipuzkoa, so she might have acted there too. - Oh. - First, we must find the connection between the midwife and the parents of the deceased babies. - Only then will Markina give us a warrant. - I'll check her. Second, check every crib death in Gipuzkoa and Navarre, particularly daughters, in towns by the Baztan river. - It's the river Bidasoa in the north. - I'll deal with that. Check if the families got rich after their deaths - to establish a pattern of profit. - Mm-hm. Third, I need a warrant for Argi Beltz. I can't justify it, so look into the Martínez and find a way. I'll take that. Right, let's keep an open mind and consider every possibility. Excuse me. I wanted to... I wanted to apologize for my accusations the other day. It's already forgotten, Amaia. And I wanted to tell you to please... trust Jonan. The case was reopened thanks to him. He deserves our admiration and our respect. Certainly, Detective. You can go. Yes? Marc. I'm sorry for calling. - I didn't want to bother you. - Don't worry, you did well. I don't know why I thought they would have cleaned it up, but when I saw it was still there, I froze and couldn't go inside. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Yes, I'll wait for them. Thank you. I'll ask Professor Santos to run the analysis. He's a forensic examiner who specializes in fabrics. We've worked with him before. God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Amaia, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about what happened. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I thought we'd spend the night together. I have so much to do. And this judge won't stop asking for proof. So I need to get some. You won't stop, will you? Amaia, you have to stop. Can't you see the pain you're causing? I love you and I want you to stay in this house, but it won't work out if you keep obsessing over ghosts of times past. It's not an obsession, Javier. It's survival instinct. - I can't rest while she's out there. - Rosario is dead, Amaia. I won't discuss this again, and definitely not with you. If you truly love me, it's for who I am. I'm a soldier, a tracker. I will not stop. Stay. Please. I have to go. Since he woke, he's already protested several times, so that's a good sign. Let me know when you can talk. He'd like to hear you. I hope you're well. I want you to know that I'm your friend and I'm here to help. - Deputy Inspector Etxaide's demise... - Not demise. Murder. It made me think there are certain details you should know. You see, Navarre has always been a land of saints, a pillar of the Church. But, perhaps for that very reason, the presence of evil has been constant. For a long time, we've been worried about the proliferation of sects in the country. Witchcraft and Satanic rituals are not a thing of the past, Amaia. Three years ago, in Madrid, a man confessed to taking part in a human sacrifice in 1979, in a townhouse in Lesaka. But I know every open homicide case in Navarre... Not this one. The judge ordered secrecy. Did they find the baby girl? Never. And the accuser? He's lived in hiding ever since. Under the protection of the police and Opus Dei. Where? Pull over up there. Father Sarasola, Detective Salazar. This way. This is Detective Salazar. About 30 years ago, I met a girl here, during San Fermín. She invited me to her place. It was some sort of colony where we lived, danced and got high all the time. The leader's name was Xabier Tabese. He was a very special man. He spoke of magic, spiritualism, witchcraft and... and something he called "going back to our roots." Is this him? No, that's me. He mostly kept to himself, but... But I have some pictures of the place. Do you know if Xabier Tabese was his real name? Back then, I didn't question anything, Detective. I was 25 years old, I had friends with a marijuana plantation, and a girl who was crazy about me. Tabese said if we awoke the primal forces with offerings, we could get anything we wanted. But the more we got, the more he demanded of us. We... We worshiped him. We would have done anything for him. Sacrifices? We always had those, yes. We would offer animals, following a ritual directed by him. We had orgies, drank his blood, smeared it on our bodies. We felt powerful, like gods. And then... her parents did it themselves. They offered their daughter and killed her just like Tabese told them. Then he took the body, and a few days later, the group vanished. I never saw any of them again. I know they all thrived. In just a few years, us shabby people, we got rich, Detective. Very rich. What happened then? Years later, my son was diagnosed with cancer. At the hospital, I recognized a doctor that had been involved in the whole thing. He suggested an offering to save him, a sacrifice. I considered it. But the voice of God in my head was much stronger. My son died a few months later. Then I decided to speak out. And my life fell apart. I lost my wife, my job, my friends... I lost it all. I understand there were more groups in other small towns. There was one in Baztan, close to performing a sacrifice. They had a daughter they fed just barely, waiting for the moment to offer her. - That's all I know. - Do you know this woman? Yes, she was in the Baztan group. She was pregnant when I met her, she was... How do I put this? She was... very devout. And... during the sacrifice... do you remember what the process was, to obtain what you wanted? She was sacrificed to Inguma, to evil. It had to be an unbaptized baby girl. Baptism is a commitment to a different god. Why girls? Tabese said that when Inguma awakens, it always takes victims of the same gender and the same age. What about the bodies? They were taken to a magical place, he said, older than Christianity, where the offerings were also left. - The forest? - I don't know. He took her, but that's all I know. What did you get in exchange? Whatever we wanted. - But... - No buts, Detective. We got everything we wanted. What happened to those who chose to leave the group? You don't get it. No one can leave the group. No one. Sooner or later, Inguma collects its debt. We scattered, yes, but... But you never... never truly leave. Fuck. Shit. - Fermín. - Amaia. Someone broke into my house. They took the hard drives. I think they were after Jonan's files. Then get the fuck out of there! Right, I will. What did you want? Dr. González just called to talk to you. He said Dr. Takchenko had an accident and is in the ICU. Nadia! What happened? Apparently, a car rammed hers off the road. The police say the car had been searched. Dr. González told me. He was devastated. Thank you. I'll be right there. Fuck. Honey, can you smell Auntie's lentils from America? Yes. All right, James, I'll tell her you called, okay? Take care. Agur. Agur. Why are you cooking this late, Auntie? Amaia, is there something you're not telling me? No. No, everything's fine. Don't you love him anymore, Amaia? Of course I do, Auntie. We found him, Chief. Xabier Tabese, died 11 years ago in a boating accident. That's him there. He's listed as a therapist in several records, but we're still looking into him. The point is he definitely had deep pockets. Yeah. Ask the keeper where the orchids are from. - Find out who foots the bill. - Right. Yolanda? Don't look like that. I know my rights. I can take pictures of a public place if I want. - Why are you here? - I'm following your movements. - Following me where? - Everywhere. Please leave. You should be at the hospital. Have you seen those flowers? They're like tiny cribs with babies in them. Please leave. I don't want to arrest you. Go right ahead, Detective! My daughter is missing, and all you care about is your job. Get off me! I trusted you. But deep down, you're all the same. All of you. My husband's family, the doctors, the judge, the police... - You only care about yourselves. - Judge Markina? He told me to get in touch with you. He said you were a great detective, the best. And that if there was a chance, you would move the investigation forward. When we met at the house, it wasn't by chance? He told me not to tell you, but I don't care anymore. Thank you, Detective! Thank you so much. - You shouldn't drive like this. - Go fuck yourself! I just felt sorry for her, I'm sorry. She called my office and I couldn't do anything, so I told her if she got you interested in her case, you might help her. I just gave some advice to a desperate person who was suffering, that's all. - You tricked me. - I didn't. I didn't want her to say I had sent her, you understand? You won't let me open graves, but you sent Yolanda to me. You deny my requests. You say I'm obsessed with a case, and you push me towards it. - I don't get what game you're playing. - I'm not playing a game. I'm only protecting you. - As a judge, I have my limits. - Is this how you protect me? This is how I protect you and defend you. That's all. But I don't break the rules. I know you. I know you're brilliant. But don't ask me to follow you, because I need to protect you from yourself and from your fears. Come to the house tonight and let's discuss this over a bottle of wine. I can't, I told my aunt I'd have dinner with her. - I have to go. - In Elizondo? Yes. I'm hanging up. The flower shop says they change the orchids every weekand they pay cash. No names, though. It's always a different person. - Are you okay, Chief? - I'm fine. Let's go. - See you at the station? - Yes. - Chief, I have news. - What? What? - Ruling out baptized baby girls... - Yes? There are five cases with the same characteristics. If the parents aren't together, one can authorize the exhumation. - Good. - We'll do one tomorrow in Igantzi. - And I'm waiting on another two. - Good job. - What is it? - Clemos closed Etxaide's case. What? He says it was the Eastern mafias, because of drug trafficking. What the fuck? Where's the proof? That's what I said. He says they'll show up. - "They'll show up"? - All right. Chief? There's a man asking for you. Last night, I received the sample and a note from the doctor asking for an analysis as soon as possible. She said I should only show it to you. This fiber is satin, made of top-quality silk. From the manufacturer's signature on the lattice, I'd venture it was made in England. But it's hard to be absolutely sure, because it was damaged by the shot. - The shot? - Yes. Look. This here is the abrasion ring. The piece of fabric was torn away by the shot. The shooter was probably hiding the gun in his pocket, and the shot went through it. We knew it was a low shot, but we assumed the killer was sitting down. Here's your answer, Detective. It's clear to me. JUDGE MARKINA Hello? Hello? Yolanda? Yolanda! No! Help! Help! No! NAVARRE POLICE Dr. San Martín will let you know when the autopsy is over. Thank you. Iriarte and Goñi are on their way to Igantzi to open a grave. Then one more in Irun. Meanwhile, I'm still investigating Tabese. And I spoke to your sister Flora... and I told her. Thank you. Wolves don't kill themselves, Fermín. They only stop being wolves when they're killed. You chase them, you corner them and face them. You win or you die. But they never leap off a cliff. Rosario wept because she didn't want to die either. It's all a bunch of lies. Jonan's files only highlight all those lies. The grave of Yolanda's boys was a lie. Berasategui visiting my mother in disguise was also a lie. Why did Etxaide have a folder on the Basajaun case? I don't know yet. But it's a collection of lies. That's what Jonan tried to show us. Iriarte. Yes, Iriarte? Yes, open it. Proceed. She was well hydrated. Her organs perfused adequately, and her limbs too. Her skin was in good condition. Her nails were trimmed, her hair had been cut... She seemed healthy. She doesn't have any injuries that would suggest she's been exposed to the elements. I would rule out her having been in the river. Thank you, Doctor. Detective. You've chased after your mother for too long. Long enough to turn her into something unreal. Into a nightmare. Amaia, don't let her become a ghost. It's just an elderly woman, Amaia. Where are you? I hope you're happy. Turns out you were right. Why did you leave walnuts on Anne Arbizu's grave? You shouldn't have touched it. It's for her. I'm sick of lies, Flora. Of secrets, fears... I've fucking had it, sis. I want the truth, and I want it from you. Anne Arbizu was my daughter. What? Her father was a livestock trader I met at a fair. We had a fling, that's all. When Mom found out, she said to keep it a secret, and to turn her over when she was born, and that everything would be okay after that. She said that? - She said "turn her over"? - She did. She introduced me to a midwife who would take care of everything. But I didn't trust that old witch, so I moved to Pamplona. And when I gave birth, I gave my baby girl up for adoption. Mom never forgave me. - Was the midwife Fina Hidalgo? - Yes. One day... I saw my baby in the town square, in Elizondo. I recognized her immediately, Amaia. The Arbizus had adopted her. I've been chained to this town ever since, so I can keep her close. Two years ago, Anne came to the bakery. She had found out I was her mother, and she wanted to meet me. She never blamed me. Those were the two happiest years of my life. Until Víctor killed her. That's why you killed him? - No. - You knew what he was doing? - Did you suspect he was killing the girls? - No, no. No, I wasn't sure until that night, when I went to see him. You were armed, Flora, you must have suspected. You could have prevented it, done something. Look. - This picture is... Anne as a baby. - She gave it to me. It breaks my heart to see Ibai. They're identical. I didn't think Víctor was responsible for the crimes until Anne's death. Why? Because I learned how he chose his victims. What do you mean? How? Think of what he did to the bodies. He drowned them, he shaved them, he turned them back into little girls, then he dumped them in the river, don't you see? Mom told Víctor who Anne was, so he could finish what she hadn't, just like she did to our sister, to you and... to Ibai. I don't know why he picked the others, but he killed Anne because I didn't hand her over. They were failed offerings. Víctor was delivering them. They used Víctor's obsessions. That's what cults do, Amaia, you know that. They use damaged goods, like you and I. Why do you leave walnuts? Anne said that walnuts have been a symbol for women's power in Baztan for centuries. That energy doesn't end in death. Now it's the only tie I have to her. I'm so sorry for everything we've had to go through all these years. NAVARRE POLICE Evening, Chief. Both caskets were empty. The Basajaun crimes were offerings gone wrong. Offerings that never actually took place. Where are the other girls? - God fucking damn it. - What's wrong? From 1970 to 1990, there was a clinic in Las Rozas called the Tabese Clinic. It became renowned for providing new treatments from the US. The director practiced medicine under the clinic's name, but his real name was... Xabier Markina. Judge Markina's father. He abandoned us when my mother lost her mind. He left me a fund for expenses and studies, and left. You never looked for him? Never wondered what he was up to? I could imagine. Jumping from one woman to the next, living as a millionaire, traveling, sailing... in the yacht where he eventually died. Besides working at the clinic, he led two groups in Lesaka and Baztan. He introduced them to occult rituals. He's been identified by a witness. He's accused him of performing human sacrifices. - My father? - Yes. Another witness confirms there's a direct link between the Basajaun crimes and Dr. Barasategui's therapies. You've done your research. It's my job. What do you expect me to do now? - What do you want? - Don't speak to me like that, Javier. I don't have to tell you what to do. I'm a detective. I brought you the facts. It's exactly what you asked for. I promised I wouldn't go over your head. Forgive me. Forgive me. This isn't easy for me. I never thought my career would end like this. You're not responsible for your father's actions. What does the future look like for a judge whose father led a Satanic cult? Whether it's proven or not, the suspicion alone will destroy me. It doesn't have to affect you. Let me help you. - You can't. - Yes, I can. No. James. Amaia, I just spoke to your aunt. She told me about your mother. Why didn't you call to tell me? I'm still taking it in. - Come over here, Amaia. - Uh... Now more than ever, come and be with Ibai and me. I can't talk right now, I'm working. Can I talk in a while? Okay. Okay. Okay. Here. The search warrant for Argi Beltz. I love you, Amaia. I've never loved anyone this much. I couldn't bear to lose you. I'll call Iriarte and Goñi and we'll head out there, Chief. I have another call. Thank you, Fermín. - Hello? - Detective. - It's Benigno, Yolanda's father. - Yes, hello. My daughter just left. She said she was headed to a place she found thanks to you. - She said she'd end things. - Did she say anything else? She was very upset, and the police said she hadn't used all of the explosives last time. - I don't know what she's capable of. - Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Thank you. For fuck's sake! Police! Open up! Police! Open this door! Motherf... - Hey, hey! - It's us, Fermín! Oh, my God. Where's Salazar with the warrant? She's on her way. She sent it to me. - Well, technically, we have it. Right? - Mm. Good. We don't want another midwife scenario. Move. I'll cover you. Okay... Yolanda! Stop! Stop. Yolanda, stop. My daughter is in there! I'm going in! One way or another! Stop! I said stop. What the fuck... The old hag must have been hiding here all along. Is this it? Where's Amaia? Stop! Drop that rod, Yolanda. Relax. Drop it. Fuck that! My daughter is in there, and I can't be stopped! I'm going in there. Whatever it takes! Stop. I'm going in there. Even if I have to go through you. Are you all right? - You killed her. - She was attacking you. She meant to kill you. They're here. They're here, aren't they? - They're here. - Don't go in there, Amaia. Amaia. Amaia! - Don't go in there. - Are you going to shoot me? Then shoot. I'm going in, if it's the last thing I do. I'll tell you everything. Just don't go in there, please. - Please! - Why? Why didn't you stop this? I can't stop it. I tried to prevent it, but it's impossible. You're lying. At first, I didn't understand my father either. In time, I realized this was bigger than I thought. You said it yourself earlier. You yourself have felt that this is bigger than life itself. It's effective. Powerful... - Did you kill Berasategui? - And effective. He threatened you. You were terrified when you called me. And my mother? Did you kill Rosario? You said you wouldn't rest while she was alive. You wanted this. Don't go in there. Amaia, don't look inside! You're a part of this. I'm just the channel. The common thread of a religion as old as time. And it all began in your valley. A greater power than you've ever fathomed. But it must be fed. Is that what you think you're doing? Feeding some power by killing baby girls? It's a high price to pay, but the rewards are extraordinary. It's the truest way to speak to the living forces. Don't you see? You're sick. No. Don't treat me like that. Not you. My mother killed her own daughter. She tried to kill me her entire life. She tried to kill Ibai. What's this bullshit about living forces? Your mother was obsessed. But that's over and done with. I promise no one will hurt you or Ibai from now on. Why did you do this to me? Why did you approach me? Why? I didn't mean to fall in love with you, but I did. It's hard to come to terms with all this, but you're made for me. I know it. - You belong to me, and I to you. - No. All those deaths... The girls in the river, Nadia... Elena Ochoa, Flora's daughter... my sister. How many deaths rest on your shoulders? None. Amaia, none! We are all masters of our own lives, and I am responsible for yours. I love you, and I can't let anyone hurt you. Your mother wouldn't have stopped trying. You can't condemn me for protecting you. What power do you hold over those people? Did you kill Jonan? - Don't ask me that. - Oh! I had to. And now I have to do this. I'm sorry. - I love you, but... - No. I have to do it. He had Jonan's gun. We opened Tabese's grave. It's empty. We need an international arrest warrant. Right. Hello? Understood. The local town of Hondarribia is in shock after two people, yet to be identified, died last night in its cemetery. We still don't have many details about what happened, but it would seem that one of the double homicide victims is the renowned Navarrese judge, Javier Markina. The latest speculations point to his death being related to one of the cases he was in charge of, some of them very high-profile, in the past months. According to unofficial sources - at the Regional Police... - Hey... Easy. Easy. - Amaia. - James. Are you okay? Are you gonna come? A lot of things have happened. - We have to talk. - That isn't what I asked you, my love. All I need to hear is that you're gonna join Ibai and me so we can all go home together. Answer me, please. Are you gonna come? Yes. Okay. THE BAZTAN TRILOGY
