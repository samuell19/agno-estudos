Are you sure you're going back to that island? I'm going back there with you and Joy, or by myself. I will go with you there. I want to help you, Ram! Everything is going to be okay. No! I'm not going back there and so do you! Hey! Bodies of Hana and Fira are still there! The Police also can't found their bodies! What should I say to my parents, Fira's parents? That they died and we can't buried them! Ram, no one wants this to happen. Do you think I'm not broken to lose them? Especially Hana! You know how much I care for her since a long time? They all gone. And we survived, but you want to go back there? Ram, even the police can't find their bodies! Let alone us! You just going to give up your life!

Just take my life! But give them back! Ram! Come out! -Ram! -Come out! -Rama! -Come out! -Rama! -Come out! Control yourself! -Ram! -Ram! Don't do that! Get real, Miss. This hospital is full with mental patients,... not ghost! I also don't want to believe that, but I saw it myself! What if the doctor knows about this? Don't tell them! I just feel something scary in room 217. You mean Celsi's? That new patient? You want to help me, right? Starting now, you're in that room, okay? Miss, Ward Three is lack of manpower. If I am in Ward Two,... doctors will go looking for me. What should I say? There's a ghost in Ward Two? Get real, Miss! Who are you looking for, kid? There is one thing I realize. What's that? That you're always the one who understand and care about Rama. What do you mean? The way you treat Rama. Are you jealous? For God sake. Come on, Joy! This is not the right time for you to be jealous! Do you forget why we are here? Listen, Joy. Rama doesn't have anyone right now! Who? Garin? You saw it, Garin is weak and fragile. They are traumatized, Joy! And now Celsi is in mental institution. It shocked them more! Is it wrong if I'm a person who used to be close to Rama,... who want to comfort and support him? You coming here is not to get jealous about Rama, right? You know that it's really dangerous here. Why do you still want to come? Klara! Yes, I want to help them. But do you know the real reason why I'm coming here? Because I will never know and I don't know, Klara,... which is more scarier if I'm not coming. You don't come back at all,... or you're back,... but not mine anymore! Joy! Joy, quick! What's wrong? There is one spirit who reacts to our arrival. There it is! -Lock the door! -Garin! Come here! Garin, it's useless to lock the door! -Okay, it's locked. We're safe. -Garin! Garin, get in here! Quick! Darsih... Darsih. Go away! Everyone safe? It's true, there's a lesson in every incident. It's been years I know you. Elementary, junior high, high school, college. This is the first time I saw you praying really serious, Farel. It's okay, good. Now you prayed solemnly, close your eyes. So, the spirits around not bothering you, okay? Pray! Am I a ghost? You are crazy. Hey, you're crazy! Hold this. Hold this. Here. Hold that. Farel, hold this! Farel, help me. Rel, here it is. -Nurse Shelly! -Yes, doc. We lack of manpower tonight. Almost all patients in four wards go berserk. Where is Nurse Ririn? I don't know, doc. I still talking to her this afternoon. Okay. There's some patients visited by their families tonight. Sent them home, don't let this event ruined our image. -Okay, doc. -Thank you. You already embarrassed me and our family, Celsi. This is all because of your friends. I shouldn't let you hang out with those rich brats! Remember, Celsi. Since your father went bankrupt, we're nobody! Celsi! You have to stop acting as if you are the daughter of successful businessman. Wake up! For God sake, Celsi! This hospital care is not cheap. I'm going to ask them to examine you. And I won't tolerate if you pretend to be crazy... just to cover your pregnancy. I'm not pregnant! They want to kill me! -Rama! Rama, they want to kill me! -Stop it! Celsi! Please calm down, Ma'ám! Please calm down, Ma'ám! Nurse, do not tell me to calm. My daughter is not crazy! Now is the time for Celsi to rest. Please leave this place, Ma'am. Nurse,... this hospital have no right to hold my daughter much longer. Tomorrow I will be back to take her home! Celsi. Tomorrow I'll be here, dear. I'm going to pick you up here. -Ma'am? -Okay? Celsi? We already did two steps. Pagar Fana and Jogo Lilin. Now, 11 ways to go. Isn't there a lesser and quicker way? Sooner is better, right? Destroy favorite object. What favorite object? Ranti's doll. Ranti's doll. Garin, your duty is to keep the candle lit, don't let it die. That candle will guard our lives from evil spirits,... while we close Gapuro Tentrem. And that's Pagar Fana, who close their access to us. Don't you ever leave Pagar Fana, understand? -It's like watching demon boar, right? -Don't talk too much! Don't forget, if the candle about to die... Okay. But, wait! There're four of you, and I'm all alone here? Nope, you're with Mr. J. -Mr. J? Who? -Yep. There! -Huh? It's name is Mr. J? -Yes. -What should I do? -Okay. This is for our communication. Are you really going to leave me? Remember, don't let the candle die and never leave from Pagar Fana! -Let's go, move! -What should I do? Guys, be careful... Don't leave me! Guys... God... Guys? Hello? Hello, guys?

Why don't you go with Joy, and me with Rama? You can't do it. Just let me! -Let's go. -Klara, are you sure? -It's better the two of us. -It's okay. We do it as we plan it! Go, quick! -Good luck! -Klara! -Take care. -Love you. What should I do? Step three to close Gapuro Tentrem. Bury seven color flowers wrapped in white cloth,... then flush it with a bottle of vinegar.

Guys,... is it just me or you two also feel something wrong? Klara, do you remember? Every murder 13 months ago happened at 01:00 AM. We have to move now. And we should be back at the villa before 01:00 AM. And we have to go directly to Pagar Fana, or else... It's only been six hours, but already run out of battery. Step five of closing Gapuro Tentrem. Break candles, and throw it the opposite way of your movement. Step six of closing Gapuro Tentrem. Bury a copper mirror... with some part of the mirror still visible above the ground. Klara! What are you doing? Joy... Klara, don't move. I'm going for Joy! Joy! Joy! Rama, it's cold in here. I'm waiting for you and Farel. Rama, come with me! Come with me. There's a ghost! Please, help! Garin, what are you doing here? All the candles died! The Jailangkung moved! Garin, you can't leave Pagar Fana! I don't care. I don't want to get scared to death! I'd better die now! Just kill me, please! Get a grip, Garin! Garin, come on! This is our last chance! I can't leave them here. We bring them home now! -We? -Let's bring them home! Rama... Celsi! Calm down, Celsi.

I also don't understand about it, Celsi. But, why she is not here? If she want to posses me, she should've be here with me. I'm afraid, Nurse Shelly. I'm afraid it's too late to save Rama. Klara! How Klara knew... that little girl got murdered by her father with an axe? We have to focus with our purpose to go back there, Ram. I don't understand. Why's that ghost child becomes so mean? Yes. Little girl who became wandering spirits... because she's slaughtered with an axe by her own father! Klara... Is it possible that Klara is... Do you really want to go out to that island?
