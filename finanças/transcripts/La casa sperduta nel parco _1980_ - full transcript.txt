Where are you going? Keep quiet! - Don't you like me? - What are you talking about? - I wanna make love to you. Get off or I'll start screaming! Don't make me angry or it'll get even worse for you. Did you hear me? You know... ...no woman ever complained about me. Come on... Come on, you'll enjoy it, believe me. Come on! I've always liked difficult women. HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK Alex, baby! Feast your eyes on this! Come on, you should see this! - You're really something! - It seems new, isn't it? I've stolen it in the dry-cleaner. - Can I come with you, tonight? - Yes, sure. I want to dance. We go to dance! Come on! Ah, Alex, earlier, while you were out, the police came. - Is that right? - Yeah, you know, that crud who's always snoopin' around here. He was looking for a stolen black Lincoln. Fortunately, the time he gets here, the car was not there. It is not hard to be lucky. - Yesterday I went to the corner bar for a beer. - Yeah? And that particular cop happens to be there. I started telling a story. About this guy who snooped around too much... ...and in order to get even with him, they... took it out on his family. I told it loud enough so the cop could hear it. - Yes, and what does he do? - He? He doesn't do anything. He drinks his beer and he leaves. He's got a daughter... fifteen years old. Shit, you can really handle things, Alex. I've never had a friend like you. - I've never been through this part of the city. - Neither do I, until some months ago. Short cut to reach the villa. - Will Gloria, Howard and Glenda be there already? - Yes, but I gave them the keys. So they spend more time being bored. Gloria and Howard will run upstairs and start screwing. - Maybe also in this way they are boring. - Yeah. - If we are lucky, we will find it! - What? - A mechanic. The engine has some troubles. - Is it really necessary? Yes, it is. Oh, we're lucky, it's still open! Good evening, the car started making strange noises... - Could you check it, please? - Do you have any ideas about the problem? I don't know, maybe it's like something... with the electrical system. It's gonna take three to four hours to fix it and we... ...we are going boogying in ten minutes! Will twenty do it? I'm in a hurry... I know what it's like, friend, it's a bitch when your car breaks down, ...but there are two bitches waiting for us. Here's forty... - You don't know too much about cars, do you? - No, I don't. That's your problem. I don't give a shit of your car! I go to dance. You can take this 40 dollars and hire yourself a limousine. - Alex, can I give it a look? - What a drag! - I know a lot about engines, don't I? - Sure, you do. - I'll take care of it. - You got it, take care of it. - Listen, are we planning to spend all night here? - No, everything's OK. Yes, everything's really okay. - What brings you here? - We're going to see some friends, at Tom's cottage. We will have a good time! - The usual drag! - If I come with you, maybe not! For me... Ask him. Ah! Alex I found it, the alternator wire's loose. Wonderful, Ricky, wonderful! - I'll fix it up in a minute. - Take your time... - Why? - Because it's too late to go boogying. - Too late? No! What are we gonna do? - Didn't you hear? There is a party. - But does it matter a lot to you? - I told you, with me there will be surely a party! - Are you sure? Yes, without doubt. - Hey Ricky, you up for a party? - Up for it?! - Well, we're losing time. - Get in the car. - Wait a minute, I wash my hands. - Hurry up. Do we have to take him along? He looks a little bent. No, he's okay, really he's harmless. Besides, he comes with me. - I promised him. - Okay. I forgot my keys, wait just a minute. Listen, I owe you guys some money. Take it. Forget it. Ricky did you a favor. You must make a lot of money. Nobody tells that you are a mechanic. I'm special. If I don't wear a double-breasted coat, I don't touch an engine. - Have you a girlfriend? - Yes, we've been together for two months. I'll marry her. - Why didn't you take her out tonight? - We had a little fight. Nothing serious. - She doesn't wanna get laid. - And how about you? - I don't have one. You might find one tonight. - Well, it could happen. - I would like it, but I'm not an expert. Well, if the woman is an expert... there's no problem! Still nothing... - They finally made it. - You know Tom. For you all the things that Tom makes are perfect. And he takes advantage of it. - Hello, Howard. - Who are they? - Hello, Lisa. - Glenda, Gloria! - Just a couple of friends: Alex and Ricky. What is this, have we reinstituted the Open Forum? Lisa and you are the specialists. Last week it was those Jesus freaks. I still haven't waded through all their bullshit. - Don't worry, we won't disappoint you. - We're out to have some fun! Hate your fellow man, as you would hate yourself. That's our Howard. - Where did you find them? - In a garage. Our car broke down. I think they're absolutely superb! Just look at the way they are dressed and the way they move! What a great idea to bring them along! Tremendous... Anything to stop our boredom. See where I brought you? Be a good boy! They are classy people. - What else do you do besides fixing cars? - We can dance! So, do you want to dance with me? Come on, Ricky, do your number! Come on, Ricky, show her something! Ricky, you're an artist! Never mind her ass, Ricky, you're doing fine! Very good! What a style! Hey, what a class! Oh, that's really flying! Get it on! Don't let him down, Gloria! Fantastic, Ricky, fantastic! You are the best! - He's not a mechanic, he's a dancer! - Yes! You're having a really good time, aren't you, Gloria? Ricky, you are so sexy! OK, Ricky, get it on! Come on, Ricky, make a strip! They are playing with you, Ricky. They are playing with your head. Go on, the pants! I've never seen them so excited, not even for Paul Newman. Go on, Ricky! - That's enough! - Why? I'm just having fun! - You are making a fool of yourself! No, we are just having fun! Don't treat me like that, I'm not a child. - Let him be. He's enjoying himself... - Yeah, that's right. - Can't you see? - Here I am. - OK, do what you want! - Come on! Go, Ricky, you are fabulous! - Oh, Ricky, I'm sorry! - I'll go to the kitchen, I want something to eat. - Here... - I'm sorry... - Too bad you didn't get to finish... - Poor Ricky! - Did you hurt yourself? - No, it's nothing. I'll live... - Can I get you something to drink? - Sure, why not? - It's hard. - I can hold my liquor. Good! Good, Ricky. Drink it! Drink it all! You are fantastic, Ricky. Really! - Do you play backgammon? - What's backgammon? - What do you play? - Poker. - OK, everybody, let's play poker. - OK. - Aren't you gonna play? - I never hang my life on the wheel of fortune. Whether I win or lose, I make my own decisions. More defeat than victory... Do you remember? I prefer not remembering it. - Why are you laughing? What's so funny? - You. - Why? For how I drink? - No. - For how you suck the bottle. - You aren't so original! - What's the matter with you? - With you! - What do you think I am? - Somebody who wants to get laid. - Maybe, but surely not by you. - And why not? Because you are not my type, dear. When you're finished, close the fridge. And come back to us. Better than nothing. Two dollars. I'll see your two and come up five. I'll see. It's not enough. I'll see your five and come up twenty. Too much for me. - I fold. - I'll call you. Straight! It's not enough, my dear. Jacks over nines. - What a fucking blow-out! - Don't be vulgar. Hey, that's my dress you're sitting on. What are you waiting for? Why don't you come to scrub my back? - Like this? - Yes. You're not gonna take a shower? I lather up you. - Hey, where are you going? - Rinse your brains out! Check me. Three bucks. I'm out. Your three plus twenty. Pass. - You in? - How come you always manage to get cards? I'll see you. - Cover the bet then. - Don't you trust me? No, I want the money on the bet. Alex, can you lend me twenty bucks? Here, see for yourself. The cards have got to change. Look. I'll see you. Three aces! Not good enough: Flush. Shit! - Another hand? - No, I'm clean! Take it. Be careful, Ricky. You don't know the respectable people. They are taking you for a ride. These bastards are cheating! - What did you say? - You heard me, bitch! You shouldn't say those things, we could be offended. Deal the cards, Mister! Now things have got to change! You really get into it! Too bad you're so clumsy, you might made a good champ! Come on, Howard! Punch the mother out! Come on, stand up! What are you waiting for? Hit me! Come on! Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn! Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn! Arrived! Hey... You shouldn't do these things... otherwise Alex could get angry. Son of a bitch, now let's see how smart you are. - Look this game! - Stop! - No! - Shut up! Get hold of yourself, Howard! Come on! Come on! Sit down! We play another hand. Come on. Let's play cards. You don't wanna get even? They make an Asshole outta ya while you dance, and they get off on it. She does a now-ya-get-me-now-ya-don't in the shower... They stitch up you playing poker and they clean you. Ah... They're pretty good, but I've met better players. Sure, you don't expect something like this from two nice guys like them. They think we're two idiots to be teased just to kill boredom. - Do you really think so? - I do, Ricky. - But I understood it immediately. - They did not cheat on us, did they? You're great, Alex! I knew you were great! Wait and see... Would you please avoid cheating this time? Alex, did you see how kind they are now? Since nobody says a word, I start the game. Ten dollars. How nice are they now?! How many cards? One. - And you? - Two. No, three. Three. I'll keep what I have. So, did you see them? 100 dollars. No, you play! You are so curious that you just gotta see my hand. You'll see me! You too. And you too! Well. What have you all got? Two tens. - And you? - Two aces. - And you? - Three Kings. I win, a royal straight! Royal straight! No! If I tell you, it isn't necessary to look at them. You know, Alex, you must be my lucky charm. Nobody ever dealt me a royal straight! Well, what now? Do we blow this shit hole? Are you kidding, Ricky? The best is yet to come! Now we are gonna have some fun with these cunts. - Do you really mean it, Alex? - Sure I do! - Don't you like them? - I don't?! You are a stick-in-the-mud. You want to see the merchandise before you choose it. - Go ahead, pick the one you want. - I get first choice? I'm your friend, ain't I? - I like her. - So? Take her, she's yours. - Really? - Go! - Can I make love with her? - Sure! She can't wait! I'll take her in one of the bedroom! Fuck her here, so we can all enjoy the action. I can put on a real show, Alex! I got a big one! You can take your time. Our friends, here, haven't anything to do. They will stay calm and they will look at you. - I like you... - No... No! No! - Keep still! Don't scream, you'll see how I'm good. - No! No! No! Yes... Yes... Hey, see what I've got?! And now... The razor! Get the razor away from him, Tom! Pay attention, Alex! No! - Tom! - Stay there! - This is for you! - Howard! Stop it! Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you understand? I'll break you up, shit face! - No, Lisa! - Keep still! - Alex, stay there! Shut up, bitch! That's close enough. Ricky, take the razor. If it is necessary, use it. - What do you want to do with him? - Shut up! - Leave him! - Shut up! Shut up! Do you see this? Do you see it? Do you want to know I can use it? Zac, Zac! Zac, Zac! Do you understand that you mustn't break my balls? Especially when I want to have a good time! Come on, my friend. Come on. Hey! Come on! Ah! Eh! Come on... Come on... Come with me... Come with me... Like this. Come here. Come here. Ricky, come here! - We tie him. Gimme your belt. - Keep it. - I don't want to pass all the night to hit him. - You are fantastic. - Close the window. - Yes. Give me a curtain cord. Howard! - Here. - Close the other windows, and the door too. - Yes. Okay, Alex, I close with the key. Take it. Take it. And now... ...what we want to do? Anybody got any brilliant ideas? Do you have any suggestion? Ricky has an idea! Let's see if I guess... - Ah! Ah! - No! No! - So, Ricky... - No... - What are you waiting for? - No! No! - You can do it! - No... - Show her something! No... Good boy, Ricky, good boy! It's so nice, soft! No! Coward! Coward! Get off of me! You are disgusting! Disgust! Disgust! Disgust! So much for that! Gong! End of the round! Stop! What's matter? You don't like my friend? You don't like him? A few minutes ago you wanted to play! Then?! Don't be a bitch and open your legs. Fuck her, Ricky, she is yours. - Eh, Ricky, what happens now? - Shut up! She doesn't want. She's afraid and I... - I don't like to do it in this way. - What'd you say? What'd you say? You told your friend to shut up? Sorry, I... I didn't mean to... I... Believe me, I didn't... Ricky... Ricky... You didn't mean what? - You know, Alex, I'm not that fine... - I know. That's why I'm here, I'm your friend. And you don't have... You don't have to shout at me. - You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. - Okay, Ricky, don't worry about it. We're gonna have some fun, aren't we? Why me? Okay. Okay, Ricky, I understand. I'll show you how to do it, okay? Is that what I have to do? Look how you have to deal with them! Show them your cock! Where are you going? Ricky! Come here! - Make yourself useful. Keep an eye on these bastards. - Yes. Do you want the key? So you'll make it more quickly. What do you think, baby? Lower the guard. I love your tits. They are... soft. Stupid nigger! Hello, police? Are you calling the police? Do you want to play? Mistake! I joked so far... But if you want to change the rules, okay. Do you want me to kill everybody? It will finish in this way! Pay attention, Alex, she runs away! Ricky, keep these bastards under control or we are screwed! Yes. Were you looking for me? Did you have fun? Or do you want to play again? Take your clothes off. This time you can not escape. Go ahead! Now the other stuff. Hurry. Ah, no, no. Leave the suspender belt. May I please see how is Tom? Turn the lights back on. Turn the lights back on! I can't take staying in he dark. Can't keep control of my head in the dark. Now that wasn't so bad, was it? It was disgusting. Your girlfriend's a pretty lay. - Let's say that I earned a drink, please. - And why not? It's a real pleasure. You got a lotta balls. To have balls, my dear, you have to have them first up there and then down there. Many guys have them only as decoration. Do You agree? Have you ever made it with a woman? Do you have a personal interest or are you just curious? Take your choice. I do not like the curious people. I feel pity for who has a knife in his hand. Hey, Ricky, have you ever heard so many bullshits? We'll call her Miss Bitch-America. Ah, you really deserve this nickname! How can we reward her? You're nice, but you're not a great stallion. And he is even worse than you. Look at his face! Who knows where he bumped... He only likes to swim. No... He's completely out of it. There's just her left. Do you like the idea? Or you don't like her colour? I bet you like her! Go ahead. She's yours. You can fuck her. Having problems? One like you? No, I don't believe it. You can do it! You can always say two cold-blooded killers forced you to do it. Two sex maniacs. Don't be jealous. Well, I got a piece of advice for you: Watch and learn. Put on some music, Ricky. Something soft and sweet. Alex, I don't enjoy looking at them. You take care of it, faggot. Go ahead! Where are you going? - The LPs are there. What do you want to do? - I have other LPs down here. Listen to me: You must do only what I tell you. Do you understand? Don't be jerks. It's easy to cut a soft neck like this. - Don't move! Do you understand? - They must have seen the lights. - Who's fucking there now? - I don't know. - How is it? - It's Cindy. A friend of mine. Hey, must I pass the night here? Ask her if she is alone, but don't be clever. Okay? - Are you alone, Cindy? - Sure, I'm alone. Come on, open the door! Go and behave. Hi. Frank didn't wanna come. - He gets bored with bourgeoises like you. - Too bad. He doesn't know what he missed. Who's this? Where did they find you? I may be wrong, but I think I've never seen you before. - I'm Cindy. And you are... - Alex. Please, come in. Ricky? Close the door and take the key. Hurry up, she must not run away! Help! Help! Help me! Shut up! Shut up, don't scream. Come here, Buck. Come here. Shut up, Buck, come here. Go on. Come on, Buck. Go ahead, Buck! Stay calm, Buck, stay calm! Come on! Come on, Buck. Go away! Stay calm. You're coming in the right moment. You are lucky, Cindy. Trying to play the hero, huh? Heroes die young. And they are dangerous for everybody. Bring it up over your head. Isn't that right? No! Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid, I do not want to hurt you. I... I do not want to hurt you. Sweetly, oh, sweetly, ...you sleep like an angel. A butterfly... ...flies on your heart. Sweetly, oh, sweetly, ...you sleep like an angel. A butterfly... ...flies on your heart. Sweetly, oh, sweetly, ...you sleep like an angel. A butterfly... ...flies on your... Have you decided? Answer me! Yes. You're tender, soft. You're like a baby. You trust me, huh? I know what I say. She's a virgin! I'm gonna have to speak to your boyfriend. Maybe he is impotent. He has a girl like you and he hasn't fucked you yet? The world is spinning round. What a pity! But don't worry, Alex is here and he'll take care of you. Sweetly, oh, Cindy... ...you'll fuck with Alex. And if you don't, ...I'll slit your throat. Sweetly, Cindy... - It'd be crazy to go back inside. - Stay calm. I'll talk to Alex. I already did. I'm his friend, he... he listens to me. You'll see, I'll convince him to go away. Oh, Ricky, he's a criminal. We have to notify the police. The police? Are you joking?! I can't betray Alex! Well... That's for the trouble you almost caused. Close the door. Your T-shirt is backwards, Ricky. - Did you enjoy it? - Yes. - No, fucking her is funny! She isn't a little tart, she's virgin. Let's fuck her together. Me first and you second. Okay? I already fucked her! I did it! The ride I gave her! You should have seen me! Believe me, Alex, it was a show! It has been a beautiful night. We could go away now. We've had our fun! Okay, Ricky. Sure. It's right. You're so right. What are you doing? Are you trying to play games with me? Let me tell you one thing: You'll always remember your first time. And you will remember Alex, won't you? Alex... you can't go on like this. You'll come to a point, where you won't be able to stop. Alex, do you remember that girl last year? You go on like this, with the razor and then... Shut up! Shut up, idiot! That's enough, Alex! Alex... Alex... Why do you make me do it? Why did you turn against me? I didn't wanna hurt you. I mean it's you and me together. It's always been you and me together. We are friends! Don't get hooked on that fucking bitch. She'll turn her back on you, she'll make shit outta you. Calm down. They're all fucking bastards! All of them! They did this to you. They're trying to turn us against each other! I'll take you away. Stay calm. Motherfuckers! No! That's enough! OK, my friend, be quiet. Keep calm. Okay. Son of a bitch! Assassin! The girl that you strangled in the car... ...she was my sister. Do you understand it now? It was all a trap. Two guys that are going to a party, a broken car, ...a garage, two hoodlums break into my house... ...I find a gun, ...and I kill you in self-defense. You were completely taken in. Do you understand now? I'll pay you back. How are you, Alex? Do you need some help? I'll help you. Come on. Come on! Come on! Sweetly, oh, sweetly, ...you sleep like an angel. A butterfly... ...flies on your heart! We better tell the police that I was the only one who fired. With this thing, if you don't know how to use it, ...you can fire all the bullets without even realizing it. Now it's your turn. Shoot... Shoot! Shoot! Cut it out, he didn't do you any harm. And so? - You don't make the decisions around here any longer. - And who does then? I've already made up my mind, and the other... Cindy, be quiet, it's all over. - At one point I was afraid, Tom. - Me too. Especially for the others. They didn't know anything. The gun was harder to get at than I thought. - What matters? It's all over now. - But it was horrible. Or maybe... Maybe it was not like that for you? Hello, police?
