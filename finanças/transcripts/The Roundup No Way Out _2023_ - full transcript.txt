INCHEON SOUTH PORT, 2015 Watch it, it'll be a mess if the bags burst. Why ship them in paint buckets this time? He's a cop. He knew we were bringing in raw goods on this ship. Get rid of it. Wrap him up and add weight. Hey. Why did you kill him? Why? Is it wrong to kill a cop? How did he get here? I think he tailed me. You bastard! And you didn't know? You... I told you to be careful. I know, that's enough. Stop it! Bring the money. Hiroshi. It's for this month. More than usual. And the pills? We have 20 kilos. It'll be ready soon. But we gotta be discreet. The boss in Japan suspects us of sneaking pills. Just be ready to meet the buyers tomorrow. THE ROUNDUP: NO WAY OUT But you cut in first. - Come here! - I'm not going anywhere. - What're you doing? - Hey, shut off the camera. What are you looking at? - Why'd you honk? - Don't hit him! - What's wrong with you? - Come here. Wanna die, you shit? What are you looking at? What's going on? Don't do that! Sure, I get it. Get back inside. Go ahead. I said, get back inside. Hit me, hit me right now! Hey, stop! Who's this prick? What's with the fuss this morning? Who are you? Was this unprovoked? Just go, before I fucking kill you. I asked, was this unprovoked? Don't provoke me, dickhead! Shit, you a boxer? Let me rub your tattoos off. Back off! I'm feeling shitty today. Step back. - I'll stab you! - Watch out! I meant you. Police, police. Hurry up. Arrest these guys. And he needs help over there. - Sir. why'd you do that? - It wasn't me. Sir, stay still. No, no. I was just... I'm a detective, okay? - I was never here. - A detective? Arrest them, and give him medical care. Move this car, please. I gotta go to work. I'm late. I'm late. METRO INVESTIGATIONS Those scumbags you just caught made that mess in Seocho recently. We spent a year trying to catch them. How did you do that? I just knew it was them. Seok-do. Police should prove themselves with results. And that's why you're here. But please go easy on criminals. I did go easy on them. What do cops do anyway? Punish and serve, right? I thought we're supposed to "protect" and serve. Oh stop, at least he brings us good results. This only shows my nose. Since you were 20, I know you'll be trouble giving up boxing to become a cop. Take one of these energy boosters. It's from my wife. Hey, take it. - Give me one. - It's not for you. - It's made with grade-A musk. - Thank you! - Good for rejuvenation. - Wow! These are expensive so I eat only half each time. - Real men need more than half. - Use it or lose it. You ate the whole thing? Eating only half won't work. This is great. Good. What the... - Yes hello? - Where did they all go? - Hello? - How many did you eat? You know how expensive these are? How the hell should I know? - He's talking to me, right? - Exactly. You bastards! All right, sir. We got a case in Cheongdam. Let's go. Oh, my phone. - Where is it? - This way. A 28-years-old female fell from the 8th floor. We can't tell the time of death since there's no camera there. She came to the hotel with a man, but the man left by himself. It didn't catch his face. Here it is. I notified her family. You're here. Looks like they drank in the room, but there's no sign of foul play. We got the male's fingerprint, but the search turned up blank. Strange. Could he be a foreigner? I already told the guys to look into that. - Victim's prior locations? - We're checking nearby cameras. - Let's find some witnesses. - Yes, sir. The victim went to a club. Her wristband said this. Club Orange? Let's start with an autopsy. - Yes, sir. - Sure. NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE Ko's autopsy shows head injuries and cervical spine fractures KO SUN-HEE which are common for deaths from falling. But the immediate cause was cardiac arrest. It was triggered by a fatal dose of narcotics which... You found drugs in her? It's called Hiper, a recently reported new drug. It's far stronger than other drugs like cocaine or meth. And as addictive as heroin, so it causes trouble. She has quite a lot in her blood. Are you saying someone tossed her dead body out? Yes. This girl could've been dead too, going to the club with the victim. - They're done, go in. - Okay. Yeah? What did she say? She fainted after taking a drug from a Korean-Japanese. When she woke up, Ko was gone. He must've put drugs in their drinks. Let's hand this over to the narcotics division. Look, this is a homicide. Seriously? I'll take this case. The club's not letting us check their surveillance cameras. So I requested a search warrant. Who's the owner? There are three. One's thug named Lee Sang-chul. I kept calling him, but he's not answering. - Let's go there. - Without a warrant? It's fine. It's not like the disco clubs we used to go to. We can't get in. Why not? They're all about face control, so they'll bounce you out. Come. - This is it, right? - Yes, Club Orange. I feel young again. Where is this bastard? That guy's hot. What happened to face control? What is he, a thug? Hey, they're looking at us. - Smile, he's scary. - Just smile. - They're smiling. - I wonder why. As always, you know. You still a ladies' man. Still could be. Sir! What took you so long? Meet Open Sesame. He opens every club door. - Nice to meet you. - Pleasure is mine. I just need to get you in, right? But if you make it obvious you're a cop... - Shut up and hurry. - Let's go. - Hey, Sesame. - Hey, bro. - Where are your rich guests? - Right here. Seriously? They don't look like it. No, they're filthy rich! Okay, follow me. Step right in. Take it. Nice. Thank you! You're not allowed here. Go away. I got company in the MVP room. I said, go away. Don't touch me. I really know someone inside. - Move aside. - Get lost. Can't you hear me? - Give me some cash. - Shit. - Later. - Yeah, thanks! Don't you come here too often? This place is the best, though. - Got more Hiper? - Isn't it great? I wanna reach the peak so hand me all you've got. Too many of these will get us in trouble. - Dude, I got this. - Wonderful. That dickhead. Good evening, gentlemen. Two, four, six, seven, eight... What the fuck? These are drugs, huh? What? - You little shit... - Give it back. - They're not vitamins. - It's mine. You prick. Give it back you fucker, you know who my dad... What is it? - Take it. - Huh? They're drugs. - Drugs? - Yeah. Call the head office and take this brat in. I am turning this place over. This here is so hard to get, but we finally got some. Let's all get wasted today! Let's do it! These are dope with alcohol. - Who's that? - You a new bouncer? You can't just barge in, get out. Hey, hold on. Stop. Put all of these in here. What's this? Quiet. Shit, what are you doing? Looks great. Why are you putting these in the bag? Hey, look here. What? - Why am I doing this? - Good. What the fuck are you... - Sit down. - It's fucking hurts! You shitbag! Anyone out there? - Shit! - Sit down. There you are, you son of a bitch. You fucking... - Hey, don't do it. - Fuck! You work here, right? I'm sorry. Where's your boss? Let's go! Oppa Gangnam style. Cheongdam style. What the fuck? Hold on. What are you, a bouncer? - Hey, Sang-chul. - "Hey"? Fucking asshole. Wow, this fucking... How dare you throw a punch at me? What are you, a thug? No, he is. Pathetic little shits... - Great job, Man-jae. - Sir. Which car should I get in? What the hell? Good job, Seok-do. Are we done here? Wait and see. This is just the beginning. Police are proven with results. Go get them. - Is he here? - He's waiting for you. Welcome, my brother. - Good to see you. - Me too. Say hello. This is Mr. Baek. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Tomo. This way. I visit Korea every month, and this Korean boss treats me with good drugs and booze. And here, is the president of our partner company. She's the president of our partner company. Nice to meet you. Let's see the product. I know this. This is Hiper. Heard this is hard to get because of issues in Japan. Thanks to these guys, it's getting distributed again. It's even cheaper than in Japan. How much can I get? How much can I get? She's a true boss lady. We hope to buy as much as we can. For her, I can bring 20 kilos. By the day after tomorrow. That'll be $30 million. Is that okay? Here's the down payment. If it goes well this time, we'll continue to do business with you. I'll make you rich. I'll take care of customs, so don't worry about that. He said not to worry about customs. Well, now. Let's make a toast. So this is from the club? Yes, he's the one who took Ko. Stop. That's him. The video quality is so bad. Bring the owner of the club. Yes, sir. Do you know him or not? He sold drugs at your place. Spill it or else! I want to spill it, but I really don't know. How the hell do I know what my staff do behind my back? But fuck, is it right for the police to drag in an innocent man, interrogate him, and force an investigation? This is why people call you guys pigs! Hey, get me a coffee. Me? Yeah, you. He's talking to you. - Look at him glare. - Wow, you're gonna regret that words. No, not that again. They'll nail us if we cover up the camera again. Then... Let's clean the Room of Truth. Yes, it could use a cleaning. - David? - Got it. I don't think it's a good idea. It's so dusty here. Oh? What's wrong with him? Get him up. - Get up, sir. - Watch your head. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Just sit up. You suddenly felt ill, huh? - I'm really sorry. - It's fine, no worries. Ready? Go. He's a VIP who visits us once a week. I turned a blind eye to the drugs since they boost our sales big time. And? That's all. - Let's clean a bit more. - Poor thing. Wait! Please... Okay. Continue. That guy Hiroshi is a junkie from Incheon who's been visiting us since last year. We just let him in because of money. We don't sell drugs. - I'm not lying. - Where is he now? Gangnam or Incheon, but I'm not sure. Okay. Hand him over and get me Hiroshi's location. Yes, sir. I'll shake down the junkies in Seoul. Someone should go to Incheon. I'll go with the boys. - You will? - Yes. Okay, take him now. Yes, sir. So you're saying, this lady named Ms. Jung is still distributing drugs in Gangnam. Yes, she runs an exclusive bar for rich people. It opens only to members. And they secretly distribute pills there. But I won't go in there. Her brother's a thug, and he'll kill me if I get caught. I'm already on the run because of your mess yesterday. I'll let you go if you just take me there. Here, take these. - It's here? - Yes. It's locked, you bastard! That's not my problem. - Sir, wait. - Don't worry. Seriously, I'll be in deep shit. It's fine. Just check if this is the place. Hey, Sesame. Oh, hello. How did you get in? And who are you two? Did you break open the door? - I mean... - Did you break the door? Go fix it now. - Why did you do that? - I'm so sorry. Jin-su, who is it? It's nothing. We came to see Ms. Jung. Is she your friend or what? Get out. I said get out, you fuck... Calm down, okay? We are cops. You fucking shit. - This is my ID... - Bring it on. Did you dodge? How dare you throw a punch at me? We're cops. - Who are you? - I'll look around the counter. Why are you doing this here? I said, who the fuck are you? I told you, we're cops. - Cops? - Are you Ms. Jung? I heard you sell drugs. Where are they? Excuse me? What drugs? - We heard all about it. - What? Hold on. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Stop. Don't touch that. Why's there a drawer here? What's wrong with a drawer? Hon, talk to me. Please, sir. Sir! Dammit. - Hey. - Yes? Feeling bad? Sit up straight. How dare you throw a punch at a cop? But if you tell the truth, I'll cut you some slack. Tell me now. Actually, when I was young, my father was an alcoholic... - Come on. - Stop that. Do you know him? Take a look. Hiroshi. He came to our bar once a week. - I first met him in Incheon... - Do pills come in through Incheon? They make pills themselves. I was told that he's a gangster from Japan. You mean yakuza? Sir, I got Hiroshi's location. We'll get him now. He's a yakuza. Do you speak Japanese? No, sir. I can speak Japanese. I'll take care of it. Okay, but be careful. Shit, should I have gone? Sir, that's enough for today. What was that? Hello? Who's that? Can you move your car? Who the fuck are you? Move! Get him! Damn! - You prick! - My ears! I'll strangle... He's on drugs. You shit! Help, our rookie! You alright? That was so close. What's that? You pricks. Where did you get this? This is a police gun. Can't you speak Korean? You're laughing? How dare you drug people to death, huh? I'll press every charge I know so you get 30 years. Look at his face! He understood you. Captain, you got a call. Seok-do. How did it go? We're on our way with Hiroshi. Well done! Did they really think they could get away? Hey, we found a ton of drugs in his house. Got to be at least 20 kilos. - We really hit the jackpot! - Great job. Yeah, I'll buy you a drink... Hello? Captain? Hello? Hey. Hey! You can't leave me here. Take me with you. Let's go to work! Yes, sir. - Check the front. - Yes, sir. - Take the plate off. - Okay. Bring the tools. Boss, it's good we kept an eye on Hiroshi. What about Tomo? I already talked to him. Wait right there. Who are you pricks? What the hell? Don't you know us? - Better train the newbie. - What's this? Stop! Enough! Why'd you kill Hiroshi? You let the cops take the pills? If Ichijo finds out, we're all dead. He'll know we snuck the pills. Then don't let him know. If you mess this up... you're all dead to me. We're meeting Baek tomorrow. Re-package them. A police van leaving a crime scene was raided. Two arrested suspects died on site and 20 kg of drugs were also stolen. Seok-do, over here. It's this way. Stop touching me. - Let me do it. - I'm sorry. Jong-su! Hey, sit down. - Are you alright? - What happened? I'm sorry, sir. - Don't be! - Are you okay? - Yes, sir! - We're fine. What about Captain? He's in emergency surgery. He injured his head badly. Dammit... We have to send these out today, so hurry. Crabs today? They stink. Stuff them deep down there. Hello? How are you? Right now? Yes, okay. Hey, Tomo's on his way. Why pop in so suddenly? But I've got this all prepared, since that's the way I roll... He's already here? He chooses today to show up early? Welcome, Japanese. This month's money. Did you find the drugs? Check these again. What the... Shit! It's a fucking mess. We're in a rush, so clean it up. - Sure. Hey! - Yes, sir. Heard Hiroshi is dead. Will that get us in trouble? Shut it. Forget about the 20 kilos, too. Understand? Understood. From now on, you're in charge of Hiroshi's districts. I already talked to my partner. Really? Awesome. Shouldn't I meet your partner then? It's better if you don't. Just do as I say. Alright, that's fine. I just want the money. Hey, hurry and pack them up nicely. Eat up the eel and get better. - Looks good. - Thank you. Did you really not see anything? Well... There were no cameras, and we got knocked out. They were following us. Let them eat in peace. Eat up. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Didn't you see what they were wearing? Sorry, it was just too dark. - Ask them later. - Okay. Hurry and dig in. - Take a bite. - Thank... Sir. Dong-gu, what's up? I'm here for a case. How are you? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey. He used to work with me, and relocated here a while ago. Hi, I'm Hwang Dong-gu, Bukbu Narcotics Division. - I'm Gon Tae-il. - Alright. What's going on? Have a look at this. What is it? What's this? EVIDENCE NO. 3 You guys know this? Looks like the gun we found. Yes, we took it with the drugs. Well, this is our captain's gun. He went missing a couple days ago. He went missing? Our captain investigated Hiper too. Actually, this was one of Guryong's cases, but Captain got suspicious, and looked into the case on his own. Then it seems the yakuza found out. Since when have they been a problem? Here. According to my source, three years ago, the yakuza and the White Shark Clan started selling Hiper everywhere. The head of the White Sharks was killed 2 years ago. The whole gang was taken in, and the drugs were gone. But the yakuza found another partner to traffic Hiper again. Who is in charge of this case? GURYONG POLICE STATION We shouldn't be prying into another team's investigations. But I'm curious. The captain here is known to be a good cop too. He caught the White Shark Clan and even got promoted twice. Have I ever caused trouble? Yeah. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Captain Joo Sung-chul, Narcotics Division. Hello, I'm Ma Seok-do. - Metro Investigations, huh? - Yes, I'm Kim Man-jae. - Please, sit. - Sure. I heard about your team's accident. I felt so bad. We gotta arrest those dirtbags. Yeah, that's why I'm here. I heard this is related to the yakuza. Did you find anything yet? We are investigating right now, but certain things are unconfirmed. So we can't tell you for sure. It's just my boys got hurt. I just wanna see that jerk's face... Right. I wanna see his face too. - Then why don't you hurry... - Wait, hold on... I think that's enough. Let's leave it there. I'm sorry about this. We'll come by some other time. You can stay. I'd rather not. Escort them out. Just leave it to us. We'll give you a call if something comes up. - Alright, then. - Yes. - Hey, wait. - What? Do you know Captain Jeong, who's gone missing? Who? Captain Jeong Kyung-sik. Oh, right. Captain Jeong at Bukbu Station. I'm sorry to say this as a fellow cop, but he has some problems. What kind? Not sure I can tell you... It's not your case, so I don't think it's appropriate for you to ask. Sensitive, aren't you. Hey, come on. - Stop that. - Alright, alright. Well then. Call me at this number if something comes up. Will do. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. SUN'S CHINESE CUISINE I gave him the wrong card. No, don't go back. He's not going to call anyway. Why would he? Wanna go back? Dammit. What for? What if he calls the Chinese restaurant? Let's just go. They seemed uncomfortable. Yeah, with you. He looked nice... Nice, my ass. He was good-looking like me, but something was off. What's that look? I didn't say anything. By the way, the Deputy Chief wants a call. Why? He said to stop causing a mess without due process. He knows you too well. A little too well. But we'll lose our suspect that way. Hey, Dong-gu. Where is that source of yours? Babe, I want a Gucci too. Go wait in the car. Have a feast today and work hard tomorrow. Yes, sir. You got those Guccis I sent you? Thank you, sir! Alright. Goodbye, sir! What the heck? - You kidding? - Where are you going? Hey, move your damn car! - Can't you hear me? - Babe, don't. Are you two motherfuckers deaf? Move your fucking car! So, you're on the beefy side? Are you Cherry? What? Am I your buddy? I used to be a martial artist. This is my last warning. Stop messing around, and just get in the car. Fuck, you want a taste of me? Don't hurt him, you're a pro fighter. For fuck's sake. So embarrassing. You're gonna regret this. Dammit. Way too hard. - Hey, man. - Is he asleep? Wake up. Breathe, man. Is he okay? I'll wake him up. Babe, are you okay? CLUB CYBER CEO CHERRY Is this guy really your source inside the White Shark Clan? It's true, despite his looks. We should've gotten here faster. I'm sorry, your face... So, you sell used cars, and run a club too? Yeah. I heard lots of yakuza come to your club. They sell drugs there, right? A guy named Tomo, he comes every weekend to do drugs and beat people up. Here. - Tomo? - Yep. The one on the left. Tomo... Where is this guy? He's probably clubbing. Lead the way. I'll just notify my staff there. She's Japanese, so she can translate too. I can't be seen with a cop. Or I could punch you again. Is that so? Let's go then. TOKYO, JAPAN Welcome back, sir. I think Tomo is messing around with the pills. Why don't you go to Korea and fix things up. I've arrived, sir. Welcome, sir. I'll let you know when I find the pills. Where is Tomo now? We can't reach him right now. I'll fix things up perfectly. - Let's go to the office. - Yes, sir. When is Tomo coming? He's a bit late. Isn't today the promised day? We're getting off to a bad start. Where are you? We have a problem. One of our guys told Ichijo we took some pills. So? Ichijo sent a guy after us. A couple of guys already betrayed us. And? This guy's the real deal. I'm gonna lie low for a while. We'll all die if things go wrong. The pills... I'll keep them for my safety. Okay. Looks like there's a problem. It's no big deal. Just give me two more days. If you don't bring it then, you'll regret it. We don't care that you're a cop. We'll find Tomo. - Hurry! - Yes, sir! It's Ricky! Where's Tomo? I don't know. He's not here. You have to find him. Yes, sir. Sir, this is the back door. You promised, I have nothing to do with this. Okay, hurry up. - What is it, a hangout for geeks? - It's a real club. Hey, Mimi. Hang up for a sec. You got beat up again? Are the Japanese guys here? High and crazy like always. They're putting it on their tab again. I'll take care of it. Just bring these guys in. More gangsters, great. Stop that. Please follow Mimi inside. Come with me. - Dong-gu, use the back doors. - Yes, sir. Thanks. Yep, it's here. Good luck. Damn bastard. It's here. Wait, my stomach hurts. Hey, no ugly men allowed here. We're police officers. We're looking for Tomo. Get lost. Can you translate? Fuck off. Hey, no one move. Stand back. Don't move. It's the police. These punks don't get it. Wait, calm down. Hey, get the car! Where you going, punk? Watch out! Where's Tomo? Excuse me. Hey. Hey, don't hide. Get over here. Where's Tomo? You bastard. Don't hit my stomach! I told you... - What's this smell? - Tomo's not here. Where is Tomo? Boss, Tomo is in a hotel in Songdo. Alright. Meet me there. - Hurry! - Yes, sir. Let's go. - You were the rat? - That's right. Damn you. Damn traitor. You look terrible. Joo Sung-chul left me no choice. I'll make things right. Ichijo is furious. Hand over the pills. Tomo's here? Yes, he is. What room is he in? Room 1610. Hey, back up! Stop that car! Stop it? Block it! Drop the knife! Hey. Seok-do! Dammit. Get him in. Man-jae, get in the car! What is it? The car won't start. Dammit. What's wrong with this? What the... Shit. Turn off the damn wipers. There are two dead yakuza. - The license plates? - I looked up... They looked them up, and they're unregistered cars. They were caught on the hotel cameras, so I'll look them up. Okay. Are you okay? Does it hurt? Is it here? Don't touch me. It's the Metro Investigations. It's this bastard that took Tomo. The guy that Tomo talked about. - The pill? - They're not at the hotel. Why are those guys here anyway? Those cops are looking for Tomo too. They're such a pain in the ass. Baek gave us two days, what now? Find this guy first. Let me ask once more. Where are the drugs? You'll kill me if I spill it. Let me go, and I'll give them to you. Go on. Don't you want those pills too? Come on. They're worth 30 million. Only I know where they are. Really? I'll just find them myself. Look for where the pills might be. What about Joo? Joo Sung-chul... Stupid bastard. Alright, let us know if you find out more. Okay. Tomo is dead? Yes, the guys you met last night killed him in plain sight at a fishing wharf. Things are getting out of hand. Dammit. I should've caught those guys. Guys, can we go somewhere else though? Isn't it a little raunchy here? He brought us here. It's because we're on this case unofficially. - Hey! - No, sir? What do you mean, no? I didn't say anything. I mean, yes. What do you mean, yes? I don't know. You don't know? Come here, I'll show you. Come, sit. - You better be quick to answer. - Yes. Shitting your pants like that. What's with those pants? We got them from the front desk. I told you not to punch my stomach. - Turn on the lights. - I will. So, you and the yakuza... What the hell? What's with this? Hey, turn this shit off. I pressed stop. - Wait, it's not working. - No, it's off now. I'm sorry. - Just unplug the thing. - What the... Hey. What do you do with the yakuza? I don't do anything bad with them. I just package and deliver the goods. That's bad, you criminal. You know how many people were killed because of those pills? I don't know. Hey, then... Have you seen this man before? Look carefully. No, I haven't. You haven't? Yeah. Then who ambushed us? I have no idea. - You don't know? - What? Hey, lock the doors. Yes, sir. No, wait. Just tell the truth when we give you the chance. Let's have an ambulance on standby. I'll do it. Hey, wait a second. Wait, wait. I don't know who ambushed you. But I know it wasn't the yakuza. There's another person. They have a partner. Another person... Who? You filthy rats. How dare you turn us in? Come here. Fucking traitor. Who killed Tomo? Ricky. Ricky? Yeah, Ricky. The killer that Ichijo sent. Did he take the pills? I don't know. You don't know? Where are the pills? I really don't know. Ricky's looking for them too. Damn it, Tomo hid them somewhere. Go to Ricky, and tell him this. He's dead if he touches my pills. Wow, you investigated a lot, but there's no picture of me. Shut it, you're here with us. Yes, I am. So, the guy who attacked us and took the pills is the mystery man? Maybe. Maybe? When Tomo brings the ingredients from Japan, these yakuza process them and then start selling them. This mystery man watches over them and makes this possible. Hey, then... You know this guy, Ricky? It's my first time seeing him. This is from Japan. Read it. You want me to brief you? You know them best, so you do it. Oh, okay. Name, Ricky. Ichijo's No. 1 fixer. He's known to be the best killer in their gang. He even threw a grenade recently. Why did he come to Korea? I don't know. Again? Oh! What is it? Got it! Tomo and this mystery man stashed some of the drugs. The 20 kilos you're looking for. Ricky's here to get them back! That means Ricky will go see the mystery man? Huh? Okay, whatever. We'll just grab both of them at once. But we gotta find the drugs first. Damn, that's our boss. Have you lost it? Go stand in the corner. Bad guys need to be taught a lesson. - Where are you going? - My arm... Seok-do, where are you? I'm heading there now. You gotta get plenty of rest for that head injury. But those bastards are on the loose! I'll catch them all. You just relax, okay? How can I relax? You wait there. Jeez, this guy... - Man-jae. - Yes? Tell the boys to keep Captain at the hospital. Yes, sir. It's hot in here. No luck, huh? I told you they're not in my office. And with all due respect, you gotta crack open the window when someone's in the car, or he could die of suffocation. Trust me, we won't let you die until we're finished. Hey, any other places to search? Maybe Tomo's front company office? Yeah? Sir, we found Captain Jeong's body. Anglers found it, washed up on a breakwater. Looks like he was killed on the day he disappeared. He was still alive when they sank him. These psychos are killing cops now. They're nuts. Shit. Where are you? Sir, I'm in Tomo's office. You have to find them. Where did that bastard hide them? Hey. Who are you guys? Joo Sung-chul? Ricky? Looking for the drugs? What the fuck is he saying? Kill him. Stand back or I'll kill you! He's not Joo. It's one of his officers. It's no fun if I find him too soon. Got my message well? Looks like you and Tomo have been busy. The Chairman's not pleased about you stealing the drugs. You made a mistake. Should've killed me too. It was the Chairman's mistake not to kill him. Return them now, and I can let this one go. I made you rich, didn't I? I'm only taking my share. Or you can buy them back. He wants money. You're a big boy now? Talking back to me like that. You must think I'm a fool to negotiate with you. The drugs are his. Suit yourself then. I'm all for having fun. What's that? He's ready for fun. I'll look forward to it too. I've sent an exceptional fixer. Have fun with him. Let's wrap it up now. Looks like Ricky has cleaned up the entire gang. What about the drugs? They're not here. We're meeting Baek in a few hours. What should we do? We've got no choice. We'll meet him. The drugs? Let me talk to her. Step aside. You fucking with us? We're the Triad! Come here. I don't need you anymore. You're still buying ours, okay? This is Tomo's office. What's going on here? Good afternoon. Metro Investigations. What happened here? It's a homicide case. The victim's a police officer. Really? Here. Lee Kang-ho? He works for Joo. He was looking for something, smashing the wall with a hammer. You know the time of death? Around 2 a.m. - Let's go. - Okay. Just do as I say! That son of a bitch. Boss. The HQ is starting an internal investigation of us. These fuckers. Let's take off with the drugs. What about Ricky? He's looking for them too. We'll kill him. Get rid of those files. You too. Are you sure about this? This is against... Just do it, you motherfucker. Have you lost your mind? Excuse me. Is Captain Joo here? No, please leave. - He's not here. - He's out! Alright, we'll be back later. We can ask him instead. Really? One second. Will you stop harassing us? What is it? - Let me ask something. - Please... Why was your man at Tomo's office last night? Hey, let's just ask this later... How do I know? Maybe he was investigating. At 2 a.m.? Was he getting the drugs? - You're questioning me? - No, no. - You talking down to me? - That's not good. - We're not in the mood, so fuck off. - Watch it there, man. Fuck? Yeah, fuck. Got a problem? Stop provoking him. I don't want you to get hurt. For fuck's sake, why keeping meddling in our case? I'll beat your ass up, you fucking... You shithead. Relax, man. Let's save this for later, okay? Cuss at me again, and I'll knock you out. Let's go. Get your hand X-rayed. So? Something's off, isn't it? - They're hiding something. - Right? But we need more than a hunch. We gotta find proof. Wait. I know a yacht club that was run by the yakuza. Never mind. That one's closed. - No. - Hold on. Let's go there. Really? Okay. I'll give you the address. Good job. Keep thinking like that, okay? Roger that. - Well done! - Let's go! - I'll tell Hwang to join us. - Okay! Shut up and sit properly. But promise me you'll crack open the window later. Is it being refurbished? Behave yourself. Thanks for opening the tiniest crack, assholes. Hey. Who are you? Leave. We're not open. Leave. - We're the police. - I said, get out. Cops! Hey, you. Come here. Kill them. We met in the parking lot. Huh? Done already? Give me that, and stay down. You, translate. Okay. Why did you come here? Why are you here? We're here for money. For money. Show some respect. To collect money, sir. No, you came for the drugs. Where are they? Where are the drugs? I don't know. He doesn't know. Tell me the truth or else... Where are they? Tell me, or you die. We don't know, we're looking too. We really don't know. We're looking for them too. - Dong-gu. - Yes. - Arrest them and raise security. - Yes, sir. Take that fool in my car too. - Come here. - Sir, please... Why run a yacht business anyway? What the hell? What are these keys for? There are so many. Are these for yachts? This one's a keycard. It's got the yakuza's emblem. Lucy? Lucy. - Check everything. - Okay. Where did they hide it? Come look at this! Whatever is inside, it's locked tight. - There must be something here. - Yeah. Open it. I think you should do it. Seriously? What the hell? - This was their lab. - No wonder we couldn't find it. Unbelievable. Looks like they mixed the ingredients and produced them here. Seok-do. One more time? You do it. Come on. Should be easy for you. Gosh. This is a safe. You can't force this open. Gotta use a brain. - A brain? - How? There we go. Bingo. Bingo? This piece of... It won't budge. It's open. He tore it up. - What are these? - Just ropes? Follow me. - You see anything? - What is it? What's this rope for? - Pull it up? - There! Hiper. Found it. Boss, we found Ricky. You sure? Yes, we tailed that yakuza you let go. And the boys? I have them here. Some unregistered guns too. Get ready. Yes, sir. All that trouble for this? We have the pills, so what now? - Cherry was a White Shark, right? - Yes. Let's go see him. Joo will definitely take the bait. - Isn't this basically new? - Yes, sir. Sign the papers now. But this isn't the car we saw in the photo. Not gonna take it? After wasting my fucking time? Hey, are you shifting me? This is the car in the photo. Fuck it. Bring me the papers. Yes, sir. Still working at this hour? Doing what? Selling cars? It's got dirt all over it. Is this a flood car? A flood car? Dirt here too. You crook. Does it even run? Yes, it's a flood car. But we test-drove and everything. Yes, we did. We didn't want this car, but you kept pushing it on us. You did? No, when did I do that? Just now. How much did he ask? What's the price? - Three big ones. - Yeah? That's a bargain. For a car like this, it's a pretty good deal. You're right, sir. Three dollars. Sorry? - How much? - Three bucks. - Really? - Sure. Can we do this? Apparently it's worth $1,500 at junkyards. - Thank you, sir. - Good bye. We're no bullies. They are. Those fuckers. - Get your ass here! - Yes, sir. Aren't you curious who murdered your boss? Are you trying to piss me off? I told you he won't like it. Leave him alone. But wait. What about him? Hey, don't you want to catch whoever did this? - Sure, I do. - Right? You've got a chance here. I do? I need you to do something for me. We get it done, and we're out. Yes, sir. LOOKING FOR THE DRUGS? Hello, remember me from the White Shark clan? It's Cherry. CAPTAIN JOO Hello? What is it? I happen to have... 20 kilos of Hiper with me. Isn't this the yakuza's? Hello? So? - What? - Sorry? He hung up? This guy's smart. Send him a picture. Answer it. Yes? - What's your demand? - Huh? Well, um... GIVE YOU A DEAL You know, White Sharks used to run this business. Let us back in. Even if we sell this on our own, I know you'll bust us in no time. Let us back in the game, and we'll hand this over to you. I'll send you the address. Be there in an hour, alone. Got him. Good. Wait, Joo was the yakuza's partner in crime? Hey, it's all up to you now. That's right. He told me to come alone. Am I going alone? Of course. Got a better option? Tae-su, we found the suspect. We'll get him in the act. Can you come with the boys? Where? I'm on my way. I'll send you the address. What now? A change of plan. You prick! How dare you set foot in here? Out of the way! Step back. You want the drugs? You want those drugs? Do you have them? Let's make a deal. I know where they are. What am I doing? Hey, ready? Cherry, don't worry. You got this. Am I really on my own? Just deliver the bag. We'll bust him at the right time. What if Joo fires at me? Duck. Get in. Fuck me. This is crazy. I'm here. It's the 3rd floor. Okay. Get ready. Shit. Captain, I'm here. Captain? I'm so fucked. Help. Sir! Help me... You're that cop. Joo, that bastard. What the fuck... It's been awhile. What's taking him so long? Should we go in? Let's do that. Open it. It's salt. I'm fucked. Shit... Where is it? Please, I don't speak Japanese. Where are the pills? He knows. I know nothing. That asshole... - Doesn't feel right. - Let's go check it out. Give me the pills. You son of a... Let go of me! Joo Sung-chul! Joo Sung-chul, you fooled me? It's not safe here. We must leave.

Stop! And who are you? I asked you a question. You motherfucker! Seok-do... Seok-do... Get rid of these tonight. Hey! Where are the drugs? Where are the drugs? - Up your ass. - Beat him. It's nothing. JOO SUNG-CHUL Joo Sung-chul, are you playing with me? Where the hell are you? I'm taking the drugs. Good luck with the rest. He's getting away with the drugs! Fuck! Jeez, can we stop this now? Joo's headed somewhere? Fuck, I'm running out of time. Maha. Sir. Mr. Ma? Same here. So you know how to punch. Gosh, I'm tired. Shit, nowhere to run. This is where you die. That sword... Wait. Put it in here for evidence. Zip it! You didn't let me zip it. Dammit. Seok-do! So? Did you get Ricky? Caught him? There he is. Always late. We had to check the cameras to find you. We gotta stop him before he runs. Hold this for me. What is it? Damn. Are you okay? GURYONG POLICE STATION Wait, what are they up to now? Get everything.

Before the law, you need some ass-whooping. Broken ribs? My whole body feels broken. Detective Ma. I'll make you an offer. That bag's worth 30 million. If we split this... Don't even say fifty-fifty. I know I get fifty. I guess I'll kill you, then. You have the right to remain silent, and I'll get you a lawyer myself. Come in. Meet your lawyer. Die, you bastard! You done? Get up. Sorry, but I'm not done with you yet. You... You think you won? Me Seok-do, you son of a... Seok-do! Hey, what happened? - Clean this mess for me. - Where's... - Are you alright? - You're late again. He'd better be alive. Get an ambulance here. Yakuza members have been arrested for trafficking a new drug in Korea. The criminal who colluded with the yakuza is reportedly a member of the police force. Nice work, boys! You were a bit too harsh on some guys. But it's your hard work that saved the day. Bravo!
