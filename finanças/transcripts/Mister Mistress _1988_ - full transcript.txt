It's OK, I am very open minded! Only my family cares I get you a boyfriend another time! Excuse me, please! Alice, yours! Thanks! She's got a boyfriend! Thank God! Alice, introduce!

Alice is very kind hearted She never complained my snoring! Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is ready! Please take your seat! Mr. Ho, see you later! we have a lot to talk about! On behalf of H.K. Fitness Association! I welcome all of you! To make the night raging! we have a speech competition before dinner And I believe there are good speakers! And our guests tonight Will pick a gift from the treasure box! And we start free there And we hope that the gift can be given to one of our ladies Our first guest... Is Mr. Robert Wong! It's you! Ka Wah, I dare not argue with you! I need to choose my competitor! To make sure that I can win! Mr. Wong, pick a gift! OKI It's a crystal ashtray! See what Mr. Wong is going to say! It is an expensive ash tray The ash tray reminds me of a lighter For they are both for cigarettes But their fates are different Smokers have the lighters with them! But not the ashtray! Not matter how beautiful the tray is It only stays in the office or at home If cigarettes stand for men! The other two stand for women! Then women know the rule of fates! If a man still smokes after a hard day's work! The ashtray can still be useful! But if the man puts the ash everywhere! The ashtray is useless! It's not like a lighter! which can light up a man's life! So, for those women Stay away from the man who leaves you! Don't try to bind them! For you are an ashtray only! It seems to be meaningful! Mr. Wong, well! Will you give the present to your girlfriend? Not for my girlfriend! But for someone else's girlfriend! Someone who is even prettier, Alice! Miss Chung! Please! you welcome! After what Mr. Wong had said we ask another guest to come up! who would like to volunteer? Me That's great! What's the name please? Ho Mr. Ho, pick a gift! Good! A camera, please! The camera reminds me of a telescope! They both have lenses! And we use our eyes to use it! But they have different basic elements I take the camera and telescope as ex-lovers! They have different attitude towards love The telescope can zoom in from far away! But when you put it down! things become blur again! So it is temporary! A camera is different It keeps what has been shoot! Just like true love, it is eternity! Lovers may not get together! But if they really love one another This love will be with them forever! I hate the telescopic type of love For it is not true love! I hope that your love is like a camera! Remember your lover all the time! I bring Miss Chung's tray back! She deserves the camera! The ashtray is for Mr. Wong! Thank you for what you have said! You know I can't really talk! Don't know why I had the ideal I just couldn't stop talking! I hate man ill-treat women! we have separated for 3 months! I just want to have a little bit of change! So I asked for transfer! But he said he would get married! I understand how you feel! But don't regret what you have done! That's good! Love is only part of our life! Thanks, you know a lot! I read from the books! My Chinese is bad, can you teach me! Do you like poem?
