NEW YEAR'S EVE It's exactly what I was looking for. Let's take it there, guys. This way. HAPPY NEW YEAR Ada! Ozan! Come see the decorations. (GASPS) Whoa! -Mom, it's so fabulous. -Yay me! (CHUCKLES) -(ADA CHUCKLES) -Look at it, the whole table is... Ho, ho, ho! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! It's so small. It's like they made a Santa suit for a child. Ozan, uh-uh-uh. We need to go to the mall right now. No, my love! This suit is what Santa normally wears. He's from Antalya but it's super hot there, so, Santa's gotta wear shorts! (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLING) All right, fine. You're a cute Santa. One last thing to do! -Yeah. -Yes! (SIGHS) (GASPS) This New Year's Eve will be legendary. -Something bad's going to ruin it. -Aw, don't jinx it. No, no. (KISSES) We're just like the families in those American Christmas films, Ozan. Something bad'll happen, I can tell! Oh, stop, Mom, really! But listen, 20 people are coming tonight. I've worked on this for weeks, so if there's even one hiccup, I swear, I'll find the dirtiest public bus and go and lick it. -Oh... -Just so Covid and I can be finished! Don't be silly, my love. (IN BABY VOICE) What's happening with you? Mm? What's wrong, darling? Hmm? (CLICKS TONGUE) I don't know. I feel like things have been good lately, so now what if our good luck is through? When was it good? The last two years have been a nightmare. But it's over, right? Please, Ozan, for the love of God, say, "Yes." Sure. There's no way! Doctors never say that, come on! -Um, who could say? Maybe... -MAN: Excuse me! -OZAN: What's this? -Your deer. You'll be riding it when you pick tonight's raffle winner. (PANTING) It doesn't fit. What do we do? Uh... Why don't you try taking it upstairs, guys? -Upstairs? -DİDEM: Uh-huh! (SIGHS) Okay. Push. -Slowly. Wait. Yeah, yeah. -Excuse us! Careful... Ah! You go. (GROANS) We're all going to have fun tonight, right, Ozan? Huh? -Uh-huh. -It's been so dull. So having friends around will be good for us. Let's have a nice New Year's Eve. A normal New Year's Eve. I don't know. Remember last year? You were in Italy for business and the borders were closed so you stayed there. I was going nuts in the house, worried out of my mind, and on top of that, the pandemic. Ada caught Covid. -I was all alone here. -No. No. No... No, love, it's all over now. Please, honey. Everything's fine. My wife was even able to get off her antidepressants. The doctor said she's fine now. Ah! I haven't seen the yard yet. -Show me the patio. -Okay. OZAN: It's looks like a circus. Thank you. It does, right? -But... -I went all out for this night, Ozan. Cousins, my brother, our friends, even our staff will be here. I think in one awesome night, we're going to get back the last two years! -Yeah. -Fingers crossed. Yeah, two years, sweetie. ADA: No way! What's wrong, Ada? "A new Covid lockdown begins right now starting tonight at 7:00 p.m. "The lockdown lasts for the next three days, "through 6:00 a.m. on Monday." OZAN: Wait, that's impossible. No one'll come now. OZAN: They announce this on New Year's Eve morning? I knew it. My prediction. It's 'cause of this cursed pandemic! My darling, Didem, this is better. To have quality time, just our little family. What was that? I don't know, I'm shocked. You know, shocked. -I don't even know what I'm saying, honey. -(SIGHS) Monsieur! Espresso in this kind of cup? Educate yourself a little. Wait a second. You think I'm going to drink it like this? -Ekspresso comes like that. -"Ekspresso." "Espresso," dude, "espresso." Moron. Ozan, you can count on me being there tonight. Need me to bring some hotties for you and me to enjoy? OZAN: Ah, great. Didem, Serdar says, "I'm coming, I'll entertain my Didem." All he does is piss me off. When has Serdar ever entertained me? Oh! Awesome! She says, (STAMMERS) "Serdar's coming, thank God he can entertain me." If he's really coming tonight, have him bring Seçilay. Seçilay has to get home, though. Remember the lockdown? Serdar can let her stay there. (WHISPERS) She always there these days anyway. What'd she say? I'm trying to get rid of that woman, there's no way I'm letting her stay at my place. This some kind of joke? "Geography is destiny." Yeah, Seçilay doesn't live here. No, so no way. All right. (CHUCKLES) Okay, be there soon. -Interesting. -Welcome. Madam Eftelya, how are you? How do you expect me to be? Like absolute poop, "Mr. Advertiser." My gig was cancelled and we're stuck here. Last-minute cancellation, how terrible. Covid won't end. The cases are rising every week. Such a worrier. -Serdar... -Hmm? We'll be pacing up and down the hall in my house like we're in a prison yard. -(SERDAR CHUCKLING) -So come on over, you'll be the warden. -SERDAR: I wish. -Why not? I'm going to my friend's party at the complex. His wife was so upset when last minute it was canceled and she's been planning it for weeks. I'm headed over there this minute. Excuse me, but I am the greatest diva of Turkish classical song. What lowlifes don't invite a star to their festivities? -Preach, sister. -Oh, they'd love it, but you'd never... Who says? What else are we going to do? As if there's a way out of the estates. You've found them a free diva, so don't you let 'em miss it. Cannot miss! -That would be very good. (LAUGHS) -(ENGINE ROARING) (TIRES SCREECH) -(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) -(REVS ENGINE) (TURNS UP VOLUME) (REVS ENGINE) Well done, neighbor, you found your way here. (SIGHS) Come to see this, baby. Cheers to that. All right. (CHUCKLES) She'll sing a few songs. It'll be a night to remember. I don't want to let a complete stranger into our house, what we do with her? Is my New Year going to be worse than the one last year? What is happening? Um, I have a solution. Let's call lots of neighbors. We don't know our neighbors, Ozan, you're joking. Well, that's the point. We'll meet our neighbors and socialize. You can't let all the decorations go to waste. (SIGHS) Can I invite my friend from the complex, too? -Who is it? -Togay. We're not besties, but, um, we play tennis, so... Always sports, that's my kid. She's into whatever sport is popular. Tennis, Pilates, pole dancing... Well, whatever. More people, more fun. You go and invite him and his parents then, Ozan. Ha! My idea exactly. -Uh, right? -Block party. Sounds terrific. Gosh, we don't know anyone, though. They could be thieves or druggies. In this complex? They're all sweet Turks like we are. -It's all bourgeoisie here. -Uh-huh. Your uncle had it sent here, boss. A Death Halva? Damn it. What's wrong, Papa? Şirzat was killed, they think I did it. -Yeah, that's the message. -What was that? I said you're right, boss. They're saying, "Here, have your cousin's halva." Why on earth would I go and kill my cousin? It's one thing to shoot him in the knee but it's shameful to kill your own. These bastards are after you. Boss, if you go out tonight, I think they'll finish you off at the restaurant, so don't say I didn't warn you. They nearly got us while we were drunk, right, Togay? Damn it. But there's a new lockdown, they can't find you now. Chances are they're stuck inside, right, Papa? If they're serious, they'll come here. The thing is there's only two of us and they caught us off guard. Well, this complex has a security guard. They always call you when people arrive. You can always say we're not having guests. Good idea, son. That'll definitely scare them away. Togay, why the hell would you do that? You're eating the Death Halva? There's nothing else to eat. Maybe you're eating your father's halva right now, Togay. But the message may be, "Enjoy the last halva you'll ever eat." -Don't say I didn't warn you. -Son of a... The worst part is, boss, I think tonight they're going to come for you. Huh? You're saying that I'm definitely going to die tonight. (SCOFFS) At least we've got halva to munch on. (CHUCKLES) Just trying to lighten the mood a bit. Could you not lighten the mood on the day they're going to shoot me in the head? Put a cork in it. I'm going to be in the goddamn morgue on New Year's Eve. (MUSIC PLAYING OVER EARPHONES) -Yeah. Seriously, the Death Halva? -(MOANS) What about a hotel, Papa? ARZU: Great idea. But a luxury hotel. Why would we stay home for three days when we can hang with some big shots? Yeah? Spend some money on the girl people love to look at. We gotta consider they may ambush the entrance to the complex. (SIGHS) Staying is a risk. So is going out with Arzu. Arzu is now a risk, huh? So your solution is to lock me up here, hmm? Why do you have a younger woman if you're a jealous jerk? Huh? Go back to Togay's mother! Arzu, hold your tongue. Always drinking. I'm sweating it off, baby. Gotta rehydrate. (TREADMILL BEEPING) All right. We have Seçilay coming. She'll stay with you for three days. -Dude, that's not... -Oh! He's delighted, look. (LAUGHS) Isn't he so happy? Is there anyone else we should call? Actually, at the time when Ada had Covid, I talked to Dr. Ahmet. I think he's a plastic surgeon. Villa 88, I believe. We should invite them to the party, too. Villa 88. Serdar, let's invite 'em. (SIGHS) -Keep your hands off me. -What's wrong, baby? I just told you that you have the most beautiful eyes. I thought that'd put you in the mood. (CHUCKLES) Ahmet, your plastic surgeon boss was going to do that eyelid surgery for me. You even said, "Let that jerk do it for free." Didn't you? Well, that jerk moved over the weekend. He left his stuff for us to deal with. And? When are you going to tell your wife you're having a thing with your love? -What is this thing you're talking about? -(CELL PHONE RINGS) We're more like high school sweethearts than lovers. They need me. I have to leave. (SIGHS) Let me give you a kiss. Come on, honey. Tell your wife right now. Then I'll let you. (DOOR CLOSES) So how was the fresh air, Ahmet? The air, the air... Only thing I could get was air. -What's for dinner? -I made rice pilaf. Pilaf? It's New Year's Eve and we'll sit in this empty room and eat rice pilaf, huh? (AHMET LAUGHS) We're living in the lap of luxury, aren't we? How 'bout a vegetable omelet? (GASPS SARCASTICALLY) Man, oh, man. That's so fancy. Now that you say that, all my hopes are focused on a vegetable omelet, Şükran. I can't believe they didn't even leave a TV. They took every single one of them. I hope you're enjoying yourselves in the Maldives. We've got nothing here. You could have at least left us a TV, you bastard, Ahmet. (ŞÜKRAN LAUGHS) Your name's also Ahmet. (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) You're Ahmet. You've been laughing at this for 10 years. This is what you can get when you're rich. Hmm. Hmm... Okay, there's the friend of Ada's and his parents, doctors in 88, Seçilay and us. So, that's ten! So even if Eftelya happens to cause drama, there'll be enough guests, she'll blend in. Awesome. We have a great list, honey. This party tonight is really gonna rock! -(LAUGHS) Right? -Yeah! I think we could start a friend group with our neighbors, that'd be fun. And we could bring back neighborliness! When did we forget about comradery with our neighbors? Right, Serdar? Neighborliness is the cement of our country! And all the neighbors need one another, don't they? Neighbors should live and be close. -Come on. Right. Yup. Keep moving. -A win-win. OZAN: Everyone benefits. Let's invite them right now. This will be great. I have a great feeling about this. Didem's really got me at my wit's end. I don't know what I'll talk about with them because I don't know any of these people at all. -It's not okay. -(SERDAR LAUGHS) That's marriage for you, man. It's like you have to meet in the middle and do things your wife loves, like party with strangers, even if you don't want to. No, she's super upset. -This party has to happen. -SERDAR: Mm-hmm. My wife needs it. Hey... Um, if we were smart, we'd be calling two young girls about the party. Why the hell did you invite Seçilay? It's 'cause of you. You met her 20 years ago and started an advertisement company together. That was a long time ago. "Ex" should not be your "next." "Ex" marks the spot. -He's ready to settle down. -(GASPS) Girl, let me tell you! This man has been obsessed with me for 20 years. Yeah! He says... (BEEPS) "Seçilay, come stay with me during the pandemic "so we can brainstorm a few ideas," and so... Of course it was an excuse, but then... (SINGING) Love's in the air and feeds our desires One thing leads to another, and bingo! After 20 years, he's finally willing to commit. And what's the reason? Because of the pandemic. And Serdar realized he loved me with all his heart. Because of the pandemic. There's been no one else. And we do spend nights together. Look, it's hard finding someone. (CHUCKLES) Dad, wait! Hold on! It's Togay's. Ah! I'll tell him to come to a party. ÖNDER: I know what I'd tell my uncle if I could call him in Kazakhstan. But the bastards won't give me his number. If they came here, I could perhaps shoot them from afar. TOGAY: If they don't comply with the lockdown, then we can call the police when they get here. Then they'll be screwed completely. Whoa, that would be harsh, son. They'd be heavily fined. SELO: Huh... On second thought, how will I shoot from afar? 'Cause I have to lie down with a long-barreled gun cradled in my hands. Selo, what if we squat in an empty house that faces the door of our house, here. Could we see them from there in the dark? There's nothing like that. Tsk. No. No good. We're screwed. We're totally screwed. And don't say I didn't warn you. You're so quick to send me to the other world, is that what's up, Selo? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Be quiet. It's the neighbors. A girl. Open it. Hello, Togay. How are you doing? TOGAY: Hello there. Greetings. Nice to meet you. I'm Ozan. The neighbor. Ozan. Our children are friends. Tennis neighbors. And so, we're all under a lockdown, -so everyone's quite nervous. -(ÖNDER GRUNTS IN AGREEMENT) Because things aren't clear. And neighborliness is valuable. Important, and frankly, it's... It's like... It's like the cement of our... I think my friend is trying to say we're having a New Year's Eve party -and we wanted to invite you. -A party, huh? (CHUCKLES) Oh! Nothing too crazy. There's other families from the complex and we'll have dinner, yes... -Where do you live? -Twenty-one. Uh, it's close. We're 21, and you're 121. Basically, from our top floor, we can see you right here. -Is that right? -That's right. Actually, you can walk there. We thought this would be a good excuse to get to know our neighbors. That's a good idea, neighbor. Right. Right. Okay, then. My wife, she wrote our house number on the back of these Covid tests here. -Excuse me? -Oh! No, not because I think you have Coronavirus, you don't look sick. Um, it's just that my wife is rather sensitive right now, so if you could test before the party... ARZU: Did somebody say "party"? There will be four of us. ARZU: Did I really hear that right? Did you say "party"? You mean it? Oh, finally. God bless you for the invite! If we don't see some faces, we're gonna go crazy playing with our own feces. (LAUGHS) Right. Right. We have Arzu, and Selo coming. Happy New Year. He's my nephew. (CLEARS THROAT) Perfect, then. It's a great group. Then we will expect you all at 7:00 this evening. -When was that? -Or half past 7:00, or come by at 8:00, or how about half past 9:00? Whenever work for you. So, what does your friend's father do for a living, Ada? -ADA: I don't... -A consul would not be my guess. If a man always wears sweatpants, he's either very important or a complete loser. Oh, whatever. That's life. Not important. After all, our country is a mosaic of cultures. Those values make us who we are, Serdar. Am I right? Yes, indeed. That's why we should invite a cheerful young woman. I've been in the same agency with Seçilay day in and day out. -Fate has cursed me -SEÇILAY: Fate is bringing us together. But I've got a plan. Listen to his plan. He bought a 2,000-square-foot apartment in my condo complex and it's right around the corner. The realtor gave him away. I'll move her and the administrative department to the new place. I'll stay with the creatives in the old building. That's my proposal. He said, "Would you please make some time for me tonight? "I came up with a proposal to make sure we can always enjoy each day." So, you think it's... It's got to be a wedding. (SIGHS) Oh, Seçilay. It's been so long. And you haven't changed a bit, my beautiful friend. Aw! Thank you so much, but Serdar didn't change, either. Did he? Serdar hasn't changed in 20 years. I've just turned 45 and my deadline is coming to an end here. Being alone is so hard, Didem. Hmm. -Look, I'm negative. -(BOTH CHEER) I don't have Covid and I'm getting married! -(BOTH CHEER) -SEÇILAY: So cool! I'll talk to Seçilay tonight and break the news. -This evening? -Mm-hmm. She'll get upset. -If Seçilay's upset, then Didem's upset. -Yeah, so? You're choosing tonight out of all the nights in the last 20 years, Serdar? Sweat is dripping down my ass right now, man. You're walking around in fleece pants, no wonder. -(BLOWS RASPBERRY) -All right. -Yeah. -Look, it's 88. There it is. (DOORBELL RINGS) -Huh. Can I help you? -Ahmet, right? Who's asking? I'm your neighbor. We live in 21. I believe last year my wife had a chat with you? -Did she? -Yeah. We're having a New Year's Eve party and stopping by neighbors to invite them since there's a lockdown. We'd like to invite you. AHMET: Oh, no. We... My wife's inside. There's just two of us. -I'm not the owner of the main... -Of course! Your wife and children are welcome. We can expect you, then? My wife made a lot of preparations and we hope you'll come. Will there be food? (CHUCKLES) Food coming out your ears, monsieur. We even expect a few stomach cramps, so a doctor will be needed at this party. (LAUGHS) Eftelya will be there. She'll sing something, I'm sure of it. So, there's live music. The comforts of home and a diva! Brilliant! Yeah, we'll be there. (CHUCKLES) Excellent. Here's some tests for our guests. Take them before you come to our place. Ah, definitely. I'm a doctor, after all. (CHUCKLES) -ŞÜKRAN: What's happening? -I'm handling this, don't worry. The doctor's on vacation. Yeah, I'm on vacation, not seeing patients at the moment. They're not here for plastic surgery. Now, go inside, my love! (THUDS) (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) My wife, you know. The cobbler's son is always barefoot. (CHUCKLES) Gulnar, love. So, we're stealing you from Serdar for tonight's big to-do. You'll be in charge. Okay, my dear? Sakine won't be with us 'cause of the lockdown. So, we're very grateful to have you. No problem. Who's coming? -What are we doing at the gym, huh? -We'll walk a little while. (COUGHS) Maybe breathing exercises. -You have a cough? -Mm... Don't break up with Seçilay tonight, okay? I don't have the energy anyways. I'm feeling kinda sick. You feel sick? You were fine, what happened? Attention! Serdar Mekik. -Is Serdar Mekik here? -That's me. What? Mr. Mekik, your Covid test is positive. You must go into quarantine. What? Yesterday's test was positive? Why'd you see us before your test results came back? -I need to grab anyone who's had contact. -(SHOUTS) -Come on! -Wait a second. Let me call my wife! Sir, this is the first variant, the fatal one. -There's no time. You need to quarantine. -Okay, but... (STUTTERS) Just give me a second! Do not make this difficult for us, sir. Ow. But I'm not causing any difficulty. Don't act like I'm guilty or something. Are you telling me how to do my job? I'm an officer. Shut your mouth! Officer, I get it... Do not resist the state, you traitor! Please, let me call my wife. My family was in close contact, too. Why did you let your wife and daughter be in contact with this bastard? (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Is this a joke? So sorry, man. This was this bastard's idea. You know Alican, yeah? You've seen around the complex. Oh, definitely. He looks familiar to me, but hard to recognize with the astronaut suit. Plus the fear of death, honestly. -Ozan, you're not offended, are you? -SERDAR: Huh? No. Not at all. (LAUGHS) Just a little bit shaken. -I got panicked, though, right? -Right? (CHUCKLES) It was a witty idea. It was funny. Mm-hmm. The joke was funny. Uh, yeah. These'll all be memories. Sure, I'll come, yeah. Thank you. Whenever there's a party, I'm there. Uh-huh. We'll expect you tonight, then. Do you have a wife or girlfriend? You can bring someone. Uh... I'll bring my wife. Will there be a belly dancer? There's a diva. A diva's whatever, but a belly dancer? New Year's Eve without one would be boring, wouldn't it? Huh? Unfortunately, there isn't one. Monsieur, why don't you bring a belly dancer? What are you talking about, dude? -Stop it. -Why don't you bring the dancers? Why don't you bring the dancers? SERDAR: I'll make you dance! -I'll make you! -(ALICAN LAUGHS) (BLOWS RASPBERRY) (SERDAR LAUGHS) (BOTH GRUNTING AND LAUGHING) -(SHOUTS) -ALICAN: Come on. Come closer, you silly man. (FAKE LAUGHS) We're joking. (SMOOCHING) (ALL LAUGHING) You two enjoy. Just let me go. -OZAN: Does that sound okay? -(ALICAN VOCALIZING) Please. You can mess around, but please... Come on. Come on. Cheers! OZAN AND SEÇILAY: Happy New Year! SERDAR: Happy New Year. SEÇILAY: Are you drinking that straight, Serdar? Give me that. No. -SERDAR: What? -You need to have some water, too. -Hold on! -You wait, I'm putting some water in. If I don't, you get drunk too early in the night, honey. I know what happens. He becomes my problem, -know what I mean? -I know. -Cheers! -Happy New Year! DIDEM: Happy New Year! Cheers. (MUSIC BLARING) SEÇILAY: Yay! So cool! Listen to this music. (SINGING IN TURKISH) You brought happiness You came with happiness, my friend You've brought light and beauty You came with happiness DIDEM: (IN ENGLISH) Welcome! (IN TURKISH) Eat, drink, laugh, have fun, friends Welcome, my friends DIDEM: (IN ENGLISH) Just beautiful. SEÇILAY: Bravo! (IN TURKISH) Eat, drink, laugh, have fun, friends Welcome, my friends (WHISTLES) (IN ENGLISH) Didn't I tell you this New Year's Eve would be legendary, love? Come on. -What's wrong, Papa? -I'm a goddamn penguin! A classy party means we need to dress classy. It's called high society. You'd go in a sweatsuit if it wasn't for my good taste. ÖNDER: Wow, Selo. Very sneaky. Well done. Oh, not the gun! It better only be for shooting in the air at midnight. -Seriously, do not ruin the party. -ÖNDER: Shh! -Look, Selo, I'm a dangerous penguin. -SELO: Uh-huh. (SINGING IN TURKISH) A fairy is dancing And his maiden offers wine She keeps dancing You came with happiness (IN ENGLISH) Like that! (IN TURKISH) Eat, drink, laugh, have fun, friends Welcome, my friends (IN ENGLISH) You asked that I wear the dress. It's not my fault she's 5'7". -What's that? -Uh... We can't go without bringing something. I made a semolina dessert dish. They can do without your dumb semolina dessert dish. (SIGHS) Can you have a little bit of perspective? We're going to hang out with the richest people in Türkiye. We'll look foolish. What if they find out and tell the police? For what? They came to our door, invited us and we said, "Yes." It's a good deed we're doing! Yeah, helping people in need is a good deed, right? Uh-huh. So why don't we make the most of it and stop questioning it, okay? Come on, come on, come on! Just gonna put this away so it won't go bad. (GROANS SOFTLY) She's going to embarrass me at this party, I know it! (SINGING IN TURKISH) Filling glasses all the time Forgetting all the sad memories Let's have fun all the time You came with happiness -(IN ENGLISH) Oh! So frozen. -ALICAN: Hey! OZAN: Bravo! (MUSIC CONTINUES) ALICAN: Hup, hup! Yeah, get it! Let's go! OZAN: Whoa! (LAUGHS) EFTELYA: Oh! (LAUGHS) I'd love these people to always connect with each other like this. (SIGHS SOFTLY) It's clear, boss. You're supposed to have fun on New Year's Eve. But we can't get our fingers out of our asses! Be quiet, even I can hear you. Shush. EFTELYA: (SINGING IN TURKISH) Eat, drink, laugh, have fun, friends Welcome, my friends SEÇILAY: (IN ENGLISH) Bravo! -That was fantastic! Bravo! -Yeah! All right! Bravo! Seeing that you're using all the electricity in our town, I thought it would be good to start with my usual stage opener. -(CHUCKLES) -Please. Since you walked in, your art is so outstanding, beautiful and... Being with you is... Gosh, it's just unforgettable. I wasn't expecting that! Ah, good for me! -(ALICAN LAUGHS) -(EFTELYA CHUCKLES) My wife is still getting ready, but she'll be here. Oh, really? Very nice to meet you. I'm Didem. -I'm Alican. -Your diva adores you all! (WHISPERING) Honey? Wow! That was wonderful! -She's amazing! -Just a second. Everything's good, right? Did everyone test negative? TIMOŞ: If not, I'll die. Don't worry, you won't. (KISSES) Everyone tested. -Then elbow bump. -Yeah. (DOORBELL RINGS) Do you embarrass me. Ah, hi, you guys! Nice to meet you, sweetie. I'm Arzu. This is Önder, and Selo. And that's our Togay. Hello, Togay. -We've met. -Yeah, yes. Oh. TOGAY: Happy New Year. How are you? Hi. Happy New Year. Good evening. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) -Thank you for inviting us. -Anytime. -Happy New Year. -Yeah, back at you. ADA: Merci. Mind if I hang out upstairs instead? Why? Crowds scare him. He even likes to watch TV alone. There's a TV down here that you can watch. -(TOGAY INHALES) -Yeah, I tend to turn the volume up high. Upstairs would actually be ideal. Send him up with some snacks, he's good, no big deal. -He likes the Seda Sayan show. -Ah! -It's always Seda Sayan. -Please. In front of a genius, no one should talk about amateurs! Who is that talking about S... Seda here? -Hello, Eftelya. -Oh, my God. What the hell? You have to first consider what is being said and then consider who's saying it. Amen. Up here. -(GASPS) -SELO: This works. Uh, no. That's our bedroom. Don't go in there. It's not prepared for guests, okay? Perfect view. Isn't it? This is where you'd probably wanna sit to see the television. Ah. -I'll bring your coat to the other room. -No. It's too cold and I'm anemic. Ah, I'm sorry. I'll grab blankets if you need them. My coat will be just fine. You're very kind. -See you downstairs. Enjoy, all right? -SELO: Uh-huh. Have fun now. (SIGHS) You kidding me? Ah, he's embarrassed. He came here like a third wheel to Önder. -Ada, hon? -Hi, Mom. We wanted to play a game up here, would that be all right? Yeah, that's all right. I mean, uh... All the food and drinks are downstairs. You should have something. We can get food downstairs. I mean... I don't drink alcohol anyway. Do you, Togay? Alcohol? To be honest, it's not good for an athlete, so I don't drink, sir. Ah, I get it. That's... Good for you. So then you kids play your game. Come downstairs from time to time, okay? Thank you, Mom. Hmm, sure. Let's go. -(DOOR CLOSES) -We play soccer and stuff usually and then we also like to play racing games. You? But I had a different game in mind for you and I, gorgeous! -Everyone tested, right? -Yeah. Tests were given out to all the guests. Didem made sure everyone got a testing kit. (LAUGHS) We make our people do PCR three times a week. But this lunatic isn't handing out home testing kits. Like we've got money growing on trees. I was sneezing. I was afraid, girl. I'm not scared, okay? I drink alcohol, and alcohol kills the germs. It's scientific. Darn, Timoş, we've been putting a stick in our nose for so long. Just have a cocktail and it'll vanish. This one runs in the cold in the morning, but gets sick. He's gotta lose some weight. But he can't unless he stops stuffing his face. That is also scientific. (ALL LAUGHING) Not for your amusement. She's really acting up. -Shh! -Shh! -What'd I say? -They can hear us. Be quiet. I have prepared some challenges for you tonight. I have a prize for each challenge you pass. And if you finish all of my challenges when the night's done, you'll be my FB in the new year. F-F-Feb? Football? The... What... What do you mean? Fuck buddy. -Fuck buddy. -(ADA CHUCKLES SOFTLY) ADA: That's your advance. My advance. (TOGAY EXHALES) I'm honored. You know, I'm eager to do my duty since I got an advance, miss. I'm ready to go. Um, what do you want me to do right now? What next? Everybody... Even though we're not all here yet, the dinner buffet is ready. So if you're hungry, help yourself. -So, the belly dancer? -What belly dancer? (SERDAR CHUCKLES) SERDAR: Good evening. Good evening. Serdar? Serdar! Slow down a bit. Speed is a killer, you know? That high blood pressure. His age... Aww! (DOORBELL RINGS) Don't talk to anyone. If you have to say something, say "Bless you." Or "It's always like this." Or "It's fate." Oh, Doctor, we're glad you came. -Good evening, sir. -Hi there! Happy New Year! I'm Didem. And you are... It's fate. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Welcome, Fate. Please, we're all in here! (OZAN WHISTLES) (BOTH THUD) First challenge. Please climb down the ledge. Come back up and I'll kiss you again. But you only have four minutes to come back here to the top. What if I do it in three? Added benefits. Added what? Uh! You're so innocent, God help me. -And so sexy. Your time's started, go on. -(WATCH BEEPS) I have a flat in New York that I used to go to whenever I wanted. The pandemic ruined that. SERDAR: Mine's in Paris. It's only three hours away, but we haven't been able to go there for five years. Oh, we've been perusing small cottages in the Greek islands. There's tons over there for under 200K. -SERDAR: Wow, that's nothing. -It's so cheap. Yeah. Nothing. That's super cheap. Right? Oh. Evening. (CLEARS THROAT) Oh, Fate, you don't have to clean up after us! Oh, Didem! Uh, Melis' son brought Covid in the house. Melis has got it. The nanny got it. They're all sick. -Granny got Covid as well? Oh, my God. -SEÇILAY: Mm-hmm. How old is the woman? Probably 30, 35. That's young. Ooh. (MUMBLING) Well, even if she got married at 13... So, do you have a vacation home in another country as well? Of course I do. The broad London actually, yeah. Ah! I know London well. Where're you at? Just inside. (GULPS) The middle. The center. Hmm, which center? AHMET: Well, you know, it... Where you go in, it's sort of... Do you know it? ÖNDER: Where? When you get in you see it... There's a viaduct and when you pass that part, then you see a square, you know? After that, there's a street on the right that has a cute little package store. A package store? SERDAR: No, that must be the liquor store. -I know that street very well. -ALICAN: Ah. Not there! Not that area. When you pass it, you'll see a park, do you know which one I mean? What park? -What's the name? -SERDAR: Hyde Park, right? Hyde Park. But which side of Hyde Park is it? The right side. But to the left, it's, ah... So, when that thing, you know, is on your left, well, actually that thing is, um... It falls to the right. The park is on your right side, and then our place is to the left of that, on the right. Kensington Palace is there. Yeah. So, since you're so close to royalty, I guess the redcoats are guarding your house, monsieur? They're fairly well behaved, so most of the time, they don't really bother us. -(LAUGHS) -(CHUCKLES) (ALL LAUGHING) You know what's so important to the immune system? The first is vitamin D, of course. And then... I have a yoga position. You know it. I've done it for years. -Love it. It's awesome. Doing... -One sec. You've been on your smoke break forever. Check the hash browns. But when you try it... Uh I have a yoga position I've been doing for several years. I do a handstand on my elbows with both my legs against the wall, hold it for three minutes. I'm upside down like a bat, my toes toward the ceiling. It's always like this. (INHALE) Right. Excuse me, ma'am, have you met this Dr. Ahmet before? No, we're seeing him for the first time. -I'll introduce you! -No. Dr. Ahmet, meet neighbor Önder. So, Doctor, let me ask you something. Since you're such a beauty expert, what would be the first thing you would change with our looks, between us do you think? Oh, I wouldn't have to change -a thing on you, Didem. -Ah! But your friend here... It would take a magic wand to make any difference in his appearance, no offence. (LAUGHS) That's not true. If I had a magic wand, of course, -I'd first ask world peace. -(GASPS) But then, I'd ask for all the bald people in the world to grow their hair back. (LAUGHS) You're so sweet. Oh, pardon. ALICAN: I have an idea. (PARTY CHATTER) (DOORBELL RINGS) (SINGING IN TURKISH) (VOCALIZES) -Whoo-hoo! -(ALL APPLAUDING) ALICAN: (LAUGHS) (IN ENGLISH) That was so sweet. Happy New Year to you. Welcome, honey, welcome. Everyone, this is my wife, Neslişah. -NESLIŞAH: Thank you. -Hi, Neslişah! Eftelya, I was going to accompany you when you arrived earlier, but, see, I was too late and didn't get to play with them. I thought I'd do a solo up in here. I think you sang well. Our estate has some interesting people, don't you think? -(LAUGHS) -(PLAYS NOTES) Please take it. Here. We were invited, sweetheart. We came to have something to eat. What's wrong with that? Don't say that we're the cleaner and the gardener, okay? And you brought your wife? (WHISPERING) Keep your voice down. Someone will hear you. I wanted to bring her here, so she could have drinks. Then, I'll talk to her. So you're going to tell her tonight, right? Calm down. She needs to drink some. And please don't tell your bosses about us, Gulnar. Let's not create a scene. I can make everything right before we leave. -(YELPS) -(SCREAMS) -Good evening. -Good evening, young man. This garden is definitely bigger than ours is. I mean, they didn't plant the hydrangeas in the shade like our gardeners did. They get sun during the day. Have you seen the gardens? You look like you like flowers. No. That sort of thing doesn't hold my interest. Everyone, we can move to the table. Here we go, dear neighbors. Make yourselves comfortable. Ozan! Ozan! Can you call the kids down? Call them, so we can celebrate the new year all together, my dears. While everyone is gathering here, let's get our drinks, raise our glasses. You can also fill your glasses with water. I'm just saying, uh, not everyone drinks. Some people drink and some refrain for their own reasons. And I won't stand for anyone that has anything bad to say about non-drinkers. ADA: Mm-mm. Five minutes and 20 seconds. So what? Next time I'll be faster. ADA: Mm. You think so? -Uh-huh... -(GASPS) -Whatcha doing? -Playing basketball, Father. Come on down for a little. Say hello. This will be here when you're done. Ada. Okay. But don't forget you're losing by two! Oh, this girl's just too much. You must touch everyone downstairs once without saying anything. And then I'll forgive your mistake. I won't tell anybody. DIDEM: But on the other hand, no one should interfere with people who drink, right? Because people should be able to do whatever they want with their life, right? Tolerance as well as respect... This diversity is what makes us who we are. I feel very strongly that when we build each... Build each other up... Ah! Hey, kids, come on over here, please. Let's say "Happy New Year," all of us, over dinner. And then we'll lift up lanterns to the sky. Ah! (CHUCKLES) In the pandemic, children were the most bored of all of us. Oh, by the way, the wish lanterns we're putting in the sky, from the garden, it's not a pagan belief at all. We're just doing it for fun. -Right, Seçilay? -SEÇILAY: Oh, absolutely! Right, it's all just for fun. -Fun! -We decorate the tree, too, but that's also just for fun. Ah! Only God above knows our true intentions, for every one of us. Come on! TIMOŞ: Amen. SEÇILAY: Yes. -Come on. -SEÇILAY: Raise your glasses! Neslişah knows better, though, I would imagine. What does that mean? I've got shawls for you, just in case anyone gets chilly. There are also little gifts for each one of you, thank you all for coming. SEÇILAY: Ah! OZAN: Yep, that's my wife! She planned everything. If you get cold, cover your shoulders. SEÇILAY: Yeah. Cover your shoulders, cover your head, whatever. Envelop it all. I'll confront anyone trying to tell others what to cover and which part of them to cover with anything. OZAN: Exactly! That's just nonsense. Democracy is a regime of tolerance and that's how it should be. (MUTTERING) Enough, Ozan. Good man. Thank you. Yeah, it is. Thank you. Mm. -SEÇILAY: Mm-hmm. -(CHUCKLES) Madam, you guys are trying so hard! Things got intense due to excessive democracy, and now it's weird. -Shh. -(CHUCKLING) -What are you doing? -(SNORTS) (LAUGHS) Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She all right? Shh. We're okay. (NESLIŞAH AND ALICAN LAUGHING) -We're all good, it's nothing. -I'm so fine. -Here we go. Cheers. -ALL: Happy New Year! -(ALL CHEERING) -Happy New Year, everybody. EFTELYA: Hey! Listen to Eftelya! It's infinite! All of the lifestyles and various walks of life. Absolutely. Happy New Year. Just how old do you think I am? OZAN: It's great to have you here. May we all be blessed. It's all good. (GUESTS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) ARZU: Excuse me. You think you can be sarcastic when saying "Absolutely" to me? Tonight, you need to be more careful than that! It's lovely. Bringing that tall son of yours... So you think I look like Togay's mother? Mm-mm. More like his sister. Then that makes Önder look like my father, if I'm his sister. Are you saying I'm dating someone who looks as old as my dad? Well, it's hard to tell someone's age. Hmm. Togay seems like he's the one who looks older. It's all clear, boss. Are you certain? More or less. You know, nothing's 100% certain, boss. 90's Turkish Pop, then? Latin would be good. Latin, huh? Psst! Hey, gentlemen. Don't turn the music all the way up, 'cause she's gonna sing and we need to hear it. Huh? She's got soul in her voice. (LAUGHS) Uh, I'll keep it down. All our customers are obsessed with rap music. I'm getting super sick of it. (CLATTERING) So keep an eye on everything upstairs. Huh. My head was totally clear. Truly clear. Now the alcohol is wasted. You sobered me up. Seçilay, we should release the sky lanterns about now. No, no, no. We don't celebrate the New Year. The neighbors invited us, for dinner. Thank you, sir. I wish you a good year. My wife also sends her good wishes to you. Have a good evening. Good to talk to you. God bless you, sir. Bye. -So what do you do? -I make furniture. -I work with construction companies. -Wonderful. I hope it'll be a good year. You know, since these are really tough times. Economy, yeah. We've begun stashing dollars and euros in safes now. ÖNDER: Same here. ALICAN: And if you're doing business, you have to have at least 150,000 to 200,000 in cash. Yeah, you have to. NESLIŞAH: Is that vodka? Yeah. I... Normally, alcohol is not something I drink. Oh, yeah. I'm a huge fan of vodka, no question. Wards off those horrible hangovers. Couldn't have said it better myself. Beer is the finest way to finish after that. Mwah! Hey. Mixing fermented with unfermented, uh, will give you a monster hangover. Trust me. You know what? She could be the belly dancer. Oh! SERDAR: I saw the tattoo on her arm and thought, "What?" This Alican guy's a great man. -She's his wife. -I've never met his wife. This has to be the belly dancer. Look at her attitude, she's so comfortable. Pretty clear. I did find it weird that she talked about drinking alcohol. There must be a tantalizing costume under that dress. (CHUCKLES) Perfect plan, you know. Where is that rascal? The guy with a mustache? The lower class one, everywhere I go he's got to follow me. This is not looking too good. -There's someone on the inside. -Hey, stop freaking me out. Look, all I'm saying is be careful. Keep an eye on them. I brought you coffee. Up there, Selo. Up there! Go! I mean, she's already drunk, what is that? Really weird. Eftelya, my lady, maybe you could sing us something else from your repertoire, so we may hear your sweet voice once again. Yeah, only if you stop talking to me like I'm 90 years old. You invited us here, I'm going to sing. Really, what am I supposed to do, go fishing? ARZU: Oh, I get it. Because I'm a singer also. Everyone's a singer, honey. What really matters is if someone listens while your singing. (LAUGHS) TIMOŞ: Oh, girl, good one. Uh. We're having fun. Huh? Partying and all. Uh, toasting with vodka. But now we're sober, right? What are you talking about? I have like, 80,000 euros in a safe at home. Pandemic, economy, emergencies, you never know. All of us have at least that. (CLEARS THROAT) We still need to get a safe. Corona prevented us from having anyone here -so 50,000 euros are in our drawer. -No! -Can't be without a safe, monsieur. -I can only agree with that. That's right, that's right. Get one. It's a must. One thing's for sure. This fellow Alican's a mysterious guy. (ALICAN LAUGHING) Man, when did you see me being so mysterious? -You haven't seen anything yet. -You're in trouble, be honest! -You're gonna get me? -Be honest! I'm in trouble, huh? -(ALL LAUGHING) -Doctor, come here. -Let me go. (LAUGHING) -You got me! (LAUGHING) Come on. Let me go. Oh, you love this stuff, don't you? Alican! They need you in the garden with your drums. We're completely sober. We haven't had a drink. Hmm. Look. There's some drinks out in the garden. So sneak down there. Get me a tequila. Will do. No problem, but I... touched people downstairs. I was told there'd be a... -prize waiting for me here. -Mm. Fast learner over here. In honor of your success, you'll get a pole dance. 'Cause when else are we going to have the chance to make 50,000 dollars? Such a ridiculous idea! Oh, it's nothing to them. Don't keep saying no to a great opportunity. They'll never realize that we stole from them. You could take 100 dollars, they won't notice that. We won't notice that, either. Don't worry, they don't know either of our names, so it's unlikely that we'll get caught! The doctor might turn us in. -We'll escape! -What? Go to Georgia or something and start over. Do you know how much 50,000 dollars is in Turkish liras? (GROANS) It'd be more money than you and I have ever had! But even if I forgive you, God will not. Neslişah knows well, she'll tell that to you. Would you relax? Cameras aren't anywhere and everybody who got invited is already here. -I'm going up. If anyone comes... -But... ...you gotta send a signal. Keep an eye out, and it'll be fine. Okay? Be on your guard for the bald guy. I think he's onto me. Come on, act natural. Huh? Normal behavior, let's go. -Darling, darling... -(GRUNTING) (THUDS) (ŞÜKRAN BREATHING SHAKILY) Stealing is making my brain numb. Then you're already acting normal, huh? Perfect. Go! Go, go! Yes! Party time. Shall we join them? -(SNEEZES) -(WOMEN GASP) I hope I'm not catching some kind of cold. Oh, no, you're not. We did a PCR yesterday. -She got us all shawls. -Put one on! He has to make a scene every time -he feels a little chill. -(SEÇILAY CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) -Where is everyone? -Ozan! SEÇILAY: Serdar! (SNEEZES) My darling, it's freezing. Let's release them. Uh, Önder and Ahmet aren't here. Uh, Ahmet may have gone to the restroom. Is that where he is? Yeah, he's in the bathroom. Perfect, we'll save one. Why don't you go first, Fate? Uh, we can let one go together. Şükran. I should say shukran for you coming, habibi. (CHUCKLES) You can't go anywhere anymore without seeing an Arab. (CHUCKLES) "Arabs" are our Muslim brothers and sisters, of course. Uh, we shouldn't have bias against them. If anyone is biased towards the Arabic people, I'll challenge them. Let's release your lantern, Fate. -(NESLIŞAH SCOFFS) -Did she... -(DOOR CREAKING) -Eee! (GRUNTS SOFTLY) I am not waiting for Önder to get out of his sad mood. Release it! ALICAN: Release it. OZAN: Yes. Let go! Timoş! Release it, now! (ALL CHEERING, CHATTERING) Everyone, make a wish for the new year. (DOOR CREAKING) What's he doing? Old Baldie's onto me. (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) Timoş, Arabs have been mentioned. Should we sing another song? TIMOŞ: Let's do it. SEÇILAY: Yes, please! DIDEM: Perfect! Thank you, Eftelya! Oh. Yeah. Oh. -(MUSIC PLAYING) -Okay. Yeah! (SINGING IN TURKISH) I have a problem Just hear me out, the stars in the sky! Stealing me from myself The years have passed by I subjugated myself to suffering Because of love I've spent my life like this How cruel the years are (IN ENGLISH) Check out this vision. Like a painting. This painting you can't seem to get enough of for the last 20 years. The lanterns is what I meant. Get out of the way. (TV PLAYING) It's all peaceful, I mean at least for the time being. Do you want me to get rid of the one with the mustache, huh? Guy's a real oddball. Just calm down. There's no use getting too pumped up. I'll take care of him. You watch our house. Togay's not here? No. Not up here. He's prolly sitting in a corner. Shame, he's a nice boy. -Good evening. -Good evening. Ada challenged me to climb, which is why I climbed up through the ledge, so... I needed to find a bathroom. You could use the one right here. (CHUCKLES) Yes. You're so smart. You Gen Z-er, very sharp but hopeless. I mean, for the future. (LAUGHING) Thank you, thank you. (GROANING SOFTLY) (GROANS IN PAIN) (SINGING IN TURKISH) Fix me in this mess One nail drives out another This is its remedy This is its remedy (IN ENGLISH) It's almost time. She'll take off her dress, we'll see what she's got under it, thank God, and she'll start dancing. (LAUGHS) Huh? (YELLS) She's about to start I think, come on! You go! The deer's on fire! Go distract Didem so she doesn't see. Huh? (CHUCKLES) (SINGING IN TURKISH) Oh, I'm messed up because of love Fix me in this mess One nail drives out another This is its remedy Ah! (LAUGHS) (VOCALIZING, LAUGHING) After you left, my hair all turned to gray The seasons are not fun anymore You took my... (SINGING BADLY) You took my spring away -(IN ENGLISH) Are you okay? -I'm showing off my voice. Step aside. Go on. So where's your accordion, lady? I shouldn't have to deal with this. I'm sorry, but I don't know this song at all, Eftelya. Um... -But I can dance to this. -Fine. (IN TURKISH) My heart doesn't listen to me And wants my beloved Whoever sees me like this Tells me not to love anymore Oh, I'm messed up because of love (IN ENGLISH) So you're saying that there's no drinks and you went to the wrong room. Real smart, Togay! How can we be fuck buddies if you're accidentally walking into my parents' room, you know what I mean? Keep talking about being fuck buddies. It's like poetry. And they say, Gen Z is hopeless for the future. And yet I'm totally hopeful right now. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Where did you learn that? (CHUCKLES) I don't know but I do know that we're destined to be together, Ada. Do you want me to steal another drink for you? -You just name it, I'll do it. -You promise? I promise! Make me kill, I'll kill! You ask me to die, I'll die! Ooh, baby! It makes me cringe a little, but, ooh, baby! (MUSIC CONTINUES) -See, she's dancing. -Mm-hmm. Looking for someone? Right here, sir. Are you deliberately trying to control your boyfriend? Because you don't want all the attention to be on me? -What attention? -Their attention. Eftelya's the best. But you don't want them to know that. God forbid. God forbid. SECURITY POLICE -Evening, Officer. -No, I'm a belly dancer, actually. Police fetish. (CHUCKLES) Um, Alican Sekercioglu. He's in 27, I believe. Straight, then turn right. I'll let 'em know. MUZAFFER: Thanks. Hello! Am I a joke to you? What do you have to say to the best singer in the universe, at least in this region? You can do what you want. No one cares. What are you talking about? You have talent right in front of you. Yet, here you are, 20 years later! I am about to lose my patience. I'm outta here. It's rather obvious... You're scared. Huh. (SINGING BADLY IN TURKISH) Oh, I'm messed up because of love (IN ENGLISH) Love, hold this for me. One nail drives out another This is its remedy This is its remedy (IN ENGLISH) Hello? No, it's not 27. The party's at 21. Uh-huh. Come here in about 15 or 20 minutes, I'm still sorting the music. Okay? What? What? (THUDS) (GROANS) This girl's gonna kill me. Evening, Captain. HITMAN 1: We're here to patrol for the lockdown. No problem, Captain. -Civilian car? -HITMAN 2: That's none of your business. Pardon me, Officer. Go on. Önder is in 121. Let's kill that scumbag and leave. WOMEN: (SINGING IN TURKISH) Fix me in this mess (IN ENGLISH) I'm onto you now, monsieur. (LAUGHS) (IN TURKISH) One nail drives out another This is its remedy This is its remedy -(ALL GASP) -SEÇILAY: (IN ENGLISH) Serdar! How could you do that? What just happened? What're you doing? My bad, thought you were the belly dancer... Are you a moron? Eastern artist. I'm sure you don't like being called a belly dancer. (GRUNTS) Belly dancer... Why in the hell would you think a thing like that? What's wrong with you? That's my wife. -(GRUNTS) -NESLIŞAH: Stop. NESLIŞAH: Let's go. Come on. Do you remember I said, "When was the last time Serdar entertained me?" -He pisses me off. -SEÇILAY: Serdar... (SELO BREATHES LIGHTLY) Slow down. Here it is. Wait here. (CAR PULLS IN) (CAR LOCK BEEPS) Oh, shit, police. We gotta lose them. 121. Huh. Where is 21? I didn't do anything. I swear. Nothing. Don't move. (SIGHS) Who are you? Spit it out. -I'm Dr. Ahmet. -A doctor? Recite the Hippocratic Oath by heart, then. No, I can't reveal a secret oath. (EXHALES) Besides, do you know how disrespectful that is? This is violence against a health worker. All right then, Doctor. I have an itchy wound on my back the size of a small radish and I need you to look at it. I need you to let me know what you can do to make it go away. (HESITATING) I shouldn't, I'm only a plastic surgeon. I'll go ahead and say it now, though. See that wrinkle right there? Botox would fix that. Chiseled lines form there when you're angry all the time. Yeah, yeah. You're saying I frown too much, man. Funny, I do get called a pessimist. You see, that's right. Hey, Ahmet, uh, could you just take a quick look at this sore, real quick? (EXHALES) I told you already. I'm a plastic surgeon. Yeah, Doctor, you can help the way it looks. It's ugly. It's some kinda pustule. -What? What is that? -Oh this? Well, it's only for self-defense, Doctor, 'kay? Istanbul isn't safe anymore. It's dangerous. Yeah, but this dangerous? SERDAR: She has a tattoo on her arm. She talked about vodka. Naturally I thought, "She must be a belly dancer." How many times do I have to apologize? Enough, I'll tell you about all of it. Let me wash my face, please. "Neslişah, you okay?" "No, I'm clearly shocked but I'm okay, what are you talking about?" What? Pfft! I'll take you upstairs so you can relax. Yes, yes! Come on, come on! Let's go upstairs and find a place for Neslişah to relax. -Ms. Fate, excuse us. -Excuse me. Ah, ah, ah! (TIRES SCREECH) Follow him. That's Önder's boy. Not that fast. Slow down. I can't make a diagnosis this far away. Then why don't you come closer, my God. You're acting like this but you're not the one walking with a radish on your back. -Come, take a look. -Where? What do you mean, where? You can't miss it! Oh, you weren't kidding. Come on, come on. Give me room. ŞÜKRAN: Let's go, we're coming. We're going upstairs to find a place to lay her down. Ugh, can you stop making a big deal about it, Fate? I see it. Yes, yes, oh... It is bad. (CLEARS THROAT) Let me just do this... -(WHIMPERS) -Why are you doing that? (GRUNTING) -Just checking, Doctor. -What are you checking? (GASPS) ALICAN: Ooh... Having fun there? Dr. Ahmet? I'm checking his sore. You're checking his sore? Fistulas. Right here. He wanted me to check it, it's like a pustule. You'll wanna get an MRI. MRI's a must. -(GIGGLES) -Stop. I just never thought we'd walk in on something this ridiculous. (INHALES) Wow. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'm feeling much better. -Would you like... -Thank you very much. NESLIŞAH: Ah, where do I start... I began wearing a hijab last year. Yeah, it's pretty new... I started praying. But before then... I was going really hard. Drugs, alcohol, whatever you can think of, I used it. I was, like, a serious user. My wife's a party animal. We were on our way to Amsterdam and she starts trying to stab me. "You sold my embryos!" she said, and I was like, "It's time for rehab!" Uh-huh. That's it. Uh... I'm still in the recovery process. -She actually hasn't been out in awhile. -Yeah. -Except tonight. Yeah. -NESLIŞAH: Really? We go to dinners with the companies you're trying to win over, what's up with that? Well, that's a bit beside the point. Nah. You're like, "Behold this pretty wife of mine." I'm just trying to get you to relax, what wrong with that? Really? Relaxing? Me? You're a comedian. Whatever. I'm in recovery. I feel good, thank God. The only thing is that sometimes... I hallucinate as part of the recovery... Just curious, uh, did anyone else see that? Did I just make that up or was it actually real? I'm pretty sure it was real. Huh. It tends to happen intermittently. -It does that. -It does, Doctor. (SIGHS) He's a wimp. He's not a threat. I think he's a nobody. He's not a doctor? Perhaps but it would've been hard for him to graduate. Everything's been quiet in front of our house. -But I'll stay alert... -Okay. -Togay still here? -Togay... Togay is right here. Huh. Okay. Excellent. Aside from the tattoo and the vodka, Neslişah is the perfect name for a belly dancer, right? (SMACKS LIPS) So that's what convinced you that she was a belly dancer? (CHUCKLES) If her name was Muzaffer or something like that, I wouldn't be so sure. -Muzaffer? -Yeah. Look what the cat dragged in. All right, Eftelya. Let's do this. I've got nothing to hide. You wanna talk about what happened 20 years ago? No problem. Go ahead. I still have a scar on my ankle. We need to talk. Önder, why does she have a scar on her ankle? I was shooting champagne bottles on the stage. The bullet ricocheted and grazed her ankle. It's still all she talks about. -What happened? -Shut up, Arzu! That's mean. I'm drinking raki. -And? -Raki is sacred to a female. Everyone knows this. I don't think you appreciate me. (GUN COCKS) (WHISPERS) Where did she come from again? Well, I'm not talking about the... pandemic. It's about me. My change, this spiritual path has helped me out. Peace is my goal. God, substance abuse is so awful. (KISSES) Good for you, honey. Actually, we don't say substance abuse. We say "struggle with drugs." Exactly. You are one hell of a strong lady. Um, one doesn't say "lady" anymore. As an aesthetician you should know better. You should say "woman." But we don't say "aesthetician." We say "plastic surgeon." We don't say "customer." We say "client." I don't think we say "clients." What we say is "clientele." By the way, don't call me "Fate," I go by "Şükran." Because my name is Şükran. (SIGHS DEEPLY) From day one, Serdar, I swear, you've pulled this crap at the agency with our clients. It's me who cleans up the mess you make after your presentations! Excellent, then you won't anymore. Don't worry about it. Won't I? You're saying that you'll adjust after getting married? Glad to hear it. You're getting married? Are you dating someone? You've got more? Spit it out. How dare you come to an event that I'm invited to! You Mafia poser! Önder's in the in the Mafia? Mafia? Underground world? La familia? Is Mafia what they call it? Is "Mafia" bad to say? Maybe Cosa Nostra... Twenty years ago, he comes with his girlfriend, they sit at the big table. It was her birthday, and he insisted that I sing their song to them. Togay's mother, right? You be quiet! It was... Let the Storms Break. That was our song. We were so in love. Those were the days! (COUGHS) You be quiet right now! Shh! -That song wasn't in my set. -Of course. I left the stage without singing it. He stayed there like a fool. Oh, no, he wasn't a fool, he just... Shall we play it on my cell to reconcile everything? Listen to it now? So that... (POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Next challenge. Eftelya's your target, say the word "unfaltering" three times, 'kay? And see me without a shirt. What... No... Shir... -I'll say it in Japanese if you ask me. -(LAUGHS) What are you after? What kind of woman do you imagine for yourself? What are you looking for exactly? What more could you want, Serdar? My target audience and demographic is different, Seçilay. Around 25, not 45. Do you know what a man who chases 25-year-olds at this age is called? Yeah. "Consistent." I was also chasing 25-year-olds 20 years ago. That's always been my demographic. Even you were a 25-year-old then. (LAUGHS) I can't believe how toxic you are Serdar. Without a doubt the most toxic man ever. I finally see it. You've been consistently toxic for 20 years now, asshole. SERDAR: You're toxic, too. What do you mean? I'm done with your toxic world. You didn't sing it just to spite me. But I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose! Didn't you send your hitman backstage to force me to go back up there in my bathrobe? -Tell him that! Or do you deny it? -He would never! Oh! These are supposed to be all good memories, so... And while I was singing, does my "memory" serve that you tried shooting 21 bottles of champagne on the stage, or did I make that up? Tell me, Önder. Hey, everyone has their own idea of a good time! The Spaniards like bullfighting. Is that okay nowadays? 'Cause she should judge all the Spaniards, too! -Tell her! -Think you just did. Wait a sec! Why 21 bottles? Togay's mother was turning 21. And I wanted champagne to explode -and create a stunning moment for her. -Aw. Eftelya, please... Can you sing us an unfaltering song and make this an unfaltering evening to remember? What's he talking about? -Come on. -Just like he did, you can create a boom-boom-boom! Unfaltering stunning memory. Huh? He's a great kid. Is that only little son of yours threatening Eftelya? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna attack me? Shoot me again? Shoot me. Shoot me. -Shoot me in the ankle. Come on! -No! (YELPS) For heaven's sake. Eftelya. Önder, I'm begging you! My wife is a very sensitive person. Please. Please. I'm begging you. My son doesn't know, Eftelya. He doesn't understand. He's saying, "Let's open a bottle of champagne for you tonight!" But he doesn't know the story. I never said anything. I was so taken by his mother. He has no idea. ÖNDER: My God. She blew me away. -OZAN: Mm-hmm. -I couldn't even see straight. I carry my meds with me. Here they are. I take them all. What are each of them for? Thankfully, when I take these, I become normal again. If you all took all these pills... (YELLS) ...it would shake your world! (LAUGHS) You'll be all right, come on. You're totally normal. I'll overcome this. Wait a little more, all right? I still need time to get everyone into the mood for dancing. Alican, It won't take more than 10 minutes, am I right? The clock's ticking hon. Okay, see you soon. Are you actually bragging about the agency that we created together to me? What is going on here? Let's be clear, okay? If it weren't for me, the agency wouldn't exist, Serdar! And all that work! I get no credit for it! Without me, you would be totally unemployed. (INHALES) -Mm-hmm. -Listen, you think I'm old? (YODELS) Your ideas are from the '90s. You're not even aware. I relate to the young people! -Oh, yeah, you relate to the young. -Yes. And you do that by photoshopping all your photos on social media, right? You're so youthful! (LAUGHS) How youthful! It's so unfortunate that we can't photoshop your personality! -"Oh! But it would take forever..." -You talking to me? "...and we still wouldn't be able to fix it all!" "That's for experts!" If only we could photoshop your personality! (SNEEZES) NESLIŞAH: They almost caught us! Duck! I don't know why I'm sneezing. Please God help me. I have a bunch of tests, let me give you one. -Take it when you want. -Yes, please. DIDEM: Did I leave them downstairs or... -Yes. -Yes. (MIMICKING SNEEZING) You weren't the only one hurt that night, Eftelya. -What? -Well, one of my guys grabbed a champagne bottle and aimed his gun at it. (GASPS) Is that loaded? Uh, it was just like this one. He came right next to my ear and... (MIMICS GUNSHOT) ...fired it. Ozan, are there tests down there? This ear? Completely useless since he fired it. -DIDEM: Ozan, darling? -(YELLS) (GASPS) I'm right here. What's wrong? Are you tense? -Tense? -No tension! It's a party downstairs. We're having unfaltering fun. The Covid tests aren't where I put them. 'Cause you left all of the tests in the bedroom. Why are you being so weird, Ozan? Oh, my love. I'm trying to stop you from going downstairs for nothing. -Let's look for them together. -No, I don't want to. I don't know what's happening here. (SCOFFS) Oh, my darling, everything's okay. All good. (GASPS) I had no idea. That really happened? I try to hide it, but the left one is deaf. I can hear in this one, but this one's gone. Please don't point at things with the gun. I'm begging you! This was your doing, Eftelya. Your ankle, and my eardrum. (INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY) Ah! (STAMMERING) You're both even now, right? Can you stop talking about this? Be calm. Make peace and be friends. -I'm going to your place. -Wait a minute. Do you think we could have one last night together? Hmm? I'm going over to get all my belongings, Serdar. You understand I'm going to get all my things, Serdar! Oh, my God! (LAUGHS) I'm gonna lose it. Are you crazy? Let me tell you something. -This is an amazing night. Fantastic. -(CHUCKLES) You get freedom, which is what you wanted to begin with. This is an unforgettable New Year's. And I can finally leave this toxic relationship with you for good. Win-win. You know what I'm saying? It's a real win-win. Win-win. Got it? Congratulations. Happy New Year, Serdar. Have a good one. Very good. Forgive me, Eftelya. I was a child. But mostly, I was head over heels. Forgive me, sister. You're a wonderful gentleman. And you are a wonderful lady, my dear. I swear. (SINGING IN TURKISH) Treat me like a friend -(IN ENGLISH) Oh, Eftelya. -For this one, we'll sing together. -Ah, Timoş! Your test. -No problem. -The turkey and rice are ready. -Turkey and rice will be served. Introducing the turkey and rice fairy, Gulnar! -(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) -Well, we should probably head down now. We're invading someone's bedroom. Here we go friends, this way. -Ahmet, let's go now. -Coming. (CLEARS THROAT) Didem, could I talk to you for a minute? (IN TURKISH) Treat me like a friend Let everyone know us like that EFTELYA: All the things That have happened here today Are hidden, secret BOTH: Let it stay like that -EFTELYA: Treat me like a friend -(IN ENGLISH) Oh, my God. (IN TURKISH) Let everyone know us like that All the things That have happened here today Are hidden, secret Let it stay like that Storms Let them break Drag us both -Both of us -(STRINGS PLAYING) Let desires ignite us I'm ready for the end with you Believe me, I worshipped like that I don't know any obstacle to such love I feel crazy, you know Trust me, I lost my mind along the way Believe me, I worshipped like that (IN ENGLISH) Ozan! (IN TURKISH) I don't know any obstacle to such love I feel crazy, you know Trust me, I lost my mind along the way -(IN ENGLISH) You're still talking to me? -Of course. (SCOFFS) Gulnar just shared something, you know, and that got me very upset. What did she say? -(MUSIC CONTINUES) -DIDEM: Mm. (SNIFFLES) ÖNDER: Let's go. Once again! Well, she didn't use the bain-marie to heat the rice. So it's fully burned. -(DIDEM SOBBING, SNIFFLES) -Really? DIDEM: No, I won't cry over this. Really. Now I really need my evil eye beads. Wish me luck! (IN TURKISH) Let desires ignite us I'm content if it's with you Believe me, I worshipped like that I don't know any obstacle to such love I feel crazy, you know -Trust me, I lost my mind along the way -(MOUTHING) Believe me, I worshipped you like that I don't know any obstacle to such love -I feel crazy, you know -(INSTRUMENTS STOP) Trust me, I lost my mind along the way (EXCLAIMS) -(IN ENGLISH) Well done! -(ALL APPLAUDING) (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) And did you hear what he had the nerve to say to me? It's for the best. Let it go. I've been telling you for the last 20 years. -True. -You deserve much better. I know that. I can't do worse anyway, there's no one worse. But out of all the men in the world, look at the jerk that's with me. Your man is superb. Let's go to Serdar's and get my things. -Come with me, would you? -Okay. Okay. Didem, my dear, where can I offer the late... Late? What's going on? No. I... I was asking where can I offer the late prayer for this evening. -Uh-huh. -Uh... Feel free to use the bedroom. -It's quieter upstairs. -NESLIŞAH: All right. DIDEM: Go on up. I need some fresh air. Yeah, let's head outside. Where are you off to? God forbid we get a little break from all the festivities. -We need some breathing room. -We need to eat. -It's quieter upstairs. -Okay. Okay. Neslişah, what are you going? I'mma pray. Don't come up. To keep you from making a scene again, Fate. Su... Hey. Togay's mother got you shooting 21 bottles for her. And here I am drinking raki, and not a single raki cap has been popped for this girl. Hey, man, we won't see that gun again, right? 'Cause my wife is so sensitive. Our family's not used to these sorts of things and... -(YELPS) -I'm talking, huh? It's important. -Right here. -Okay. Here, dear. Okay. I'll talk to her. Her name was... Oh, ah, wait. Didem, do you have a stand-in prayer rug? A big sheet or a towel could work nicely. Sure, let me grab you something. Here. How bout this one? Is it good? -NESLIŞAH: Let's see. Yeah, that's good. -Okay. NESLIŞAH: That's perfect. -All right, make yourself comfortable. -Thank you so much, Didem. Come on, we don't even have a song. We've gotta. How is that possible? Well, name our song. It's... The Way You Look Tonight. -The Way You Look To-what? -Uh-huh. Others get fucking Storms but I get The Way You Look To-what? At the brothel, weren't you dancing to that on the night we met? Whoa! Please don't call it a brothel! Music hall, you jerk. -I'm not a ho don't worry. -Ho? You know, an escort. We don't say prostitute. Wait, on second thought, we do say prostitute. A hug? You maniac. -OZAN: No! -Arzu! Give that to me. Arzu! -Ozan, stop! -No, no. Keep quiet. No, no. Get em all inside. Better shoot champagne for me, too. -Give that to me! -Bring it. -Arzu! -Ozan, now! -Mr. Önder. -I said, go now! Oh, honey... Oh, honey... (WHISPERING) Oh God, I'm begging you to forgive me now. Please God, please. AUTOMATED VOICE: Where are you? What are you doing? They're calling you. Where are you? What are you doing? They're calling you. -Where are you? What are you doing? -(CLEARS THROAT) Come on, Ahmet. Where are you? What are you doing? They're calling you. -Where are you? What are you doing? -(CLEARS THROAT) -They're calling you. -(EXHALES) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) It's cheating and childish behavior that ruins a relationship. Definitely. Once kindness is forgotten, everything's down the tube. -Kindness, yeah. -Right? Oh, dear kindness! Where has the old-fashioned kindness gone? (COUGHS) -Sister. -Sister, my ass, huh! Take that test before I scream. (PERCUSSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) DIDEM: How are you? Is that Seda Sayan? She's here? I didn't see her. (CHUCKLES) (SHOUTS) No! You'll either get me champagne bottles to shoot at or I'll start shooting all you people. Ozan, get a champagne bottle, she'll shut the hell up. More than one. -ÖNDER: Fine! -Equal to my age. -Equal to her age. -There's only five bottles of champagne. Bring what you have or she'll shoot and we'll all die! Wait, wait! I'll get them. ÖNDER: Ozan... Come on. Okay. Put that on the floor. Don't point it, he's got em. Arzu, it's actually good champagne. -It is more for drinking but... Aah! -(GUN FIRES) (SERDAR SHOUTS) -Is it over yet? -(ÖNDER SIGHS) -You're my future, Ada. -(FIREWORKS BURSTING) What? Ada! Oh... Babe, I was so worried. It's just the fireworks, so beautiful. (DIDEM SIGHS) All good, you nut? Huh? Have we made up? (EXHALES) (MOUTHS) Here. That's one way to open a champagne bottle. -It's the opposite of elegance. -True. I wish she'd learn how to be a lady, that crazy gal needs a few manners. Am I right or am I right? It was just some fireworks creating all that noise. This night is great. (SIGHS) No, mm-mm, mm-mm. What is this? Hey, no. You're not seeing flashing lights, no. -This is all in your mind. -(PANTING) (INHALES) No. You're not seeing it, it's okay. (INHALES, EXHALES) Neslişah, how are you? Fine, fine. You're fine but your husband is a jerk. No, he's excellent. He might be great, but he's still a jerk. Deep inside, you have a lot you need to think through. Oh, darling! Help me, God. (INHALES) Sis... (INHALES) You're fine. Bad ass! (SINGING IN TURKISH) Hear me, darkness I'm not afraid of you I am Neslişah I can destroy you I wrote thousands of songs About how I don't give up There's no time for regrets Every day is a gift (IN ENGLISH) Ah, thanks. Ah, thanks. (WHISPERING) Thanks so much, thanks so much. (LAUGHING) (SINGING IN TURKISH) Hear me, darkness (IN ENGLISH) I'm not afraid of you, so there! (DOOR CLOSES) (PANTING) What's up? Come in five. Say something like this, uh, "House parties aren't allowed. I have to take everyone to the station." No parties allowed. I have to take everybody to the station with me. (CHUCKLING) See ya here. ÖNDER: What're you doing, Arzu? I'm going back home, Önder. Don't even think about coming after me! -(ÖNDER CHUCKLES) -Stay here! You can't even walk straight. What are you doing? Come here. Bing! (CHUCKLES) This party is dead, huh? No belly dancers, nothing. Really? Just this? (CLICKS TONGUE) You feeling all right? -Huh? -You're looking pretty pale. You should eat something. You've an empty stomach. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm so over this crap. 'Cause you shattered this relationship, Önder! (YELLING) You'll miss me! You blew it, you damn loser! I think she's mad. -Really. Seriously. -(CELL PHONE CHIMES) I'm right here, my dear. Darling. Let's head out and grab my stuff so we can be back before midnight. -We don't wanna be late. -DIDEM: Yeah. Let's go. (DOOR CLOSES) ALICAN: You all set? This is how we'll do this. Ask if you can use the bathroom and undress in there, okay? I'll start the music, I'll get the darbuka. When the drumming starts, you count to four, then go out and start dancing. Copy that. Okay. Bye. You wasted my youth. You wasted my awesome singing career! (SPITS) You wasted me! -Hey, the pool... -I see it, Eftelya. Arzu, give me the gun right now. Where are you going? Arzu, you go sit down right there. Arzu! -Stop. What are you doing? Stop. -Get away! (DOORBELL RINGS) (SIGHS) Get outta here! -EFTELYA: You're gonna fall. -I'm talking to you. -Please look at me! -You're not helping. Ugh, I don't need help from a sidekick, Timoş! -Tomiş! -You're garbage. Go run with the storms. -Come here. Yeah! -The desires will ignite you. -We need help. -Önder! Önder! Hey! ARZU: Go run with the storms. -My dear. -I know what the hell I'm doing. -Stay back. -Calm down, hon. I'm a professional drinker. Get back! Why would the police go in there? You heading out, boss? Listen, we saw the woman police officer and we're wondering, is she here for the noise? She's not an officer. She's a belly dancer. She just dressed as a police officer. (CHUCKLES) Whoa, I hope that wasn't a mistake. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Dessert. Hello? Why're you asking that? Önder decides where he wants to go. Dressed as a police officer? Where? From what I can see, there's a lot of people here. Parties aren't allowed, I'm sure you know. I have to (EXHALES) take you all to the station right now. ALICAN: Sure! Makes sense you'd take us in. We're surely making a health violation. Uh... I don't really agree with this gentleman. This gathering happened very last minute and everyone's about to leave anyway. I promise, Officer, everyone will leave now. (SCREAMS) -You scared me. -You haven't talked to your wife yet. -You told me you would. -AHMET: I will but... She just needs more to drink. Trust me, okay? Don't you know me better than that? Oh, I do. Which is why I don't trust you. Your time is up. -You're a liar. -Leave me be. (SCREAMS, BREATHING HEAVILY) How are you? You plan to run away with the Jeorgian girl and the cash? "Jeorgian?" Yes, I'll do that. Okay. Sure. We can head downstairs. -What's up? -Get inside. -AHMET: What's happening? -Go. Officer, they're already leaving. Can you forgive us this once? Uh... May I use your bathroom, please? Oh, yeah, come in, go ahead. Over... Over here. It's right here. Let me get the door. -Önder, say goodbye! -Hold on. -I am, Eftel... -Shh. They aren't gonna put us in jail, are they? A lady who drinks raki is sexy! Whatever! -No, no. -Be careful, do not... Guys, I'm aware of the pool. -Happy New Year, okay? -Happy New Year. You will miss this girl. A blonde storm! (SCREAMS) -She fell in! -My God! Well done. ALICAN: Whoo-hoo! TIMOŞ: Somebody help her. Uh, she's all the way out. TIMOŞ: I told you. Listen, I told you. Swim to the ladder. -Relax, guys. I can see the pool, okay? -You need help. Just swing your... You're overreacting. Stop. Come on. Swim to the ladder quickly, you're gonna freeze in there. I am. I'm going. I can't believe what's happening here. No. This happened because she got jealous. Arzu, swim to the ladder. Why are you swimming over there? Hey. Swim to the ladder, damn it, towards the ladder. -What's wrong with you? -Okay, darling. Come on, use your feet. Good. Come. My dress is sinking. -ÖNDER: Okay, okay. -The water's pulling it. But I don't know that lady. And there's no country called "Jerogia," it's "Georgia." Gülnar's from Uzbekistan, screw-up. You're the screw-up. You said you didn't know her! She can't get out. She can't get out. She can't get out! Boss! Boss! Come here, come here! -Okay. Come on, come here. -He's angry and it's gotta be cold. -You must step onto that. -Come over here. (COUGHING) -You don't need to be emotional. -(GASPS) Look, uh... Didem didn't care about my break up with Seçilay. But you had to do it tonight? I don't take things like this too seriously. Your job, your career, those are the things you should be thinking about. Career? Sure, there's a new CEO at your company. It'll be a miracle if they keep you on the team, you should look at other job offers. Have you considered that? Hmm? Hmm. But what do you mean? I'll just do this test and relax a little. She's angry and I'm scared. A police costume? Uh-huh. He's their guy, but he's telling the truth. He wanted to prepare you in advance. Hmm. Your demography isn't 45, it's 25-year-olds. Tomography? You men are all the same. "It's always like this." (EXHALES) This new CEO is working with his own team. Haven't you looked for a another job, my friend? No one told me anything. Even I know 'cause we're working on the advertisements. Even I know. -Huh? -Of course. Return the money, or I will end up reporting your name. There was an officer downstairs. Who called the police? Why are they here? (PANTING) What are you going to do? -Commit suicide? -I'll run away. To Jerogia. (SIGHS) We still have a mortgage. Brother. You should bet on the right horse. Choose the right steed. The animal that adapts best with surroundings always wins. Learn these things. When ya think about it, it's obvious, eh? Eh. Get her upstairs, come on. What are you waiting for? She's freezing. We're taking her to shower. -You okay? -(SPITS) Let's check around the backyard. The gun's in the pool! Let's go! Quick, quick, quick. So I said "unfaltering" three times downstairs. You promised me something. What now? Keeping our word is our honor. Oh. ADA: Mm. What do you have to say? So good. Everything's all clear out here. Let's get inside the house and lock all the doors. I hear breathing. Hey! Who the hell are you, bastard? I'd like to raise my other hand, then I could hold up both of them, but then I'll fall all the way down, and I'm begging you, please, don't shoot. Tell me who you work for. Dr. Ahmet, sir. What? Dr. Ahmet. Number 88. I'm the gardener and my wife is the cleaning lady. Sir, we don't have any bad intentions. I promise. See? We're only here to eat and drink. I wouldn't, but he just wanted to have a good time for once. What good time? Screw-up. Can you shut up? (INHALES) Our relationship is toxic, as you can probably see, right? What do we even do here? We didn't do anything. I swear, we... (LAUGHS) Gulnar told on us? Why would anyone waste officers' time on us? Huh? Who does that to a great law enforcement agency? Get inside. Please don't tell on us. The doctor will fire us if he finds out about this, okay? Get inside. Get! I'm getting. (GASPS) God bless you. Just go inside! Help me in! You don't need to speak so loud, Ahmet! -Pull me in, God damn it. -Have some manners! -You're making those gentlemen angry. -I'm losing my mind. I'm dealing with something suspicious here. Look around carefully. Because... ...before I met you... ...Togay was fractured. Yet now... ...we are whole. Do you know what I'm saying, Ada? We are whole. We are whole. (INHALES) (SIGHS) ŞÜKRAN: Damn you. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a job, Ahmet. We should photoshock your personality. Keep moving. Thank you, dear. Okay. Give it to me. Look at this star in front of you. Huh, looking like an old woman. TIMOŞ: Not at all. (BREATHILY) Okay. It's been a long time since she went in there... Right? Get upstairs, it might be dangerous. What's goin' on, man? -There might be a shoot-out! -There's a shoot-out? (SHRIEKS) I'm Covid positive! -Don't come over here. Get out. -What? Oh, my God. Don't come. Don't come in. Mask. Mask. Where's a mask? Mask, my mask. Hey, Doctor! Doctor! Thank God you're here right now. Timoş tested positive. He has Covid! -(SHRIEKS) What? -Do something! -Don't come near me! -Did you hear me? Covid! -I don't wanna catch the damn thing. -(SHRIEKS) Someone has Covid? Lock the door. ÖNDER: Everyone head upstairs. They're coming disguised as officers to kill me. No, the officer's here for the party. (LAUGHS) She's using the toilet. (YELLING) -ALICAN: She's not an officer! -MUZAFFER: (YELLS) -(SCREAMING) -(PAINED YELLING) (SCREAMS) God, my eyes! Oh, oh, oh. (YELLS) -God, my eyes! -I have Covid. I have it. We're all gonna die. Get away from me. -OZAN: What's going on? -Corona's in my body! ALICAN: Mask, where's a mask? TIMOŞ: I'm too young to die. Let's go, let's kill him. (ALICAN EXCLAIMING) (SERDAR EXCLAIMING) Where'd he go? What the hell, man? Önder. Are you okay? (GRUNTING) I can't believe it. (YELLS) (EXCLAIMS) Togay, what are you doing? Ada is my honor, Papa? -What? -Stop it! Don't be stupid! -(GRUNTS) Let go! -ÖNDER: Son, no... Togay! Togay! Togay! Togay! Hurry up, we'll get Corona. Quick! TOGAY: Let go! Papa. The two of us, we have a special connection. -Ada and I have become one. -What the hell are you saying? And this whole family is my responsibility from now on, Papa. Hmm, the end. Togay, don't rile me up right now. Togay. Let go! (YELLS) You can't hurt them. -No! -Damn! Everyone down! They're shooting! Get down! Down! (PANICKED CHATTER) AHMET: We're all gonna die! (SOBBING) ÖNDER: Son! (PANICKED CHATTER) (POPPING) Who does he have downstairs to shoot champagne for now? ÖNDER: Get down! -Togay! -(ALL PANICKING) SELO: Önder, I told you so. We won't leave here alive. (SOBBING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) DIDEM: Serdar, I'm trying to call Ozan but he's not picking up. Do you know what's happening? ÖNDER: What's happening? What's happening? We got all the way over here and weren't sure if it was fireworks or someone shooting off rounds for fun. And, of course, the power went out. (LAUGHS) Ozan's on the phone? Ozan, let me tell you what's going on. Apparently there's a minister who's a guest in the complex. They thought that the power cut was a terrorist attack. There are cops everywhere! I'm sure you heard the chuh! Chuh! Chuh! We were so scared, I can't believe it! Hello there, guys. Every person they have in the special ops is here. (LAUGHS) Because of this all the special operations are in our neighborhood! Just for us! (SINGING) Operations, darling... For me and my friend Ah, it's back on. -It's on. Ozan. -Okay. Is the power back on there, too? Everything's okay here. DIDEM: Hey, Ozan. Do you think the power went out because of all my decorations in the garden? SEÇILAY: For sure, for sure. We'll be back over in a few minutes. See the gun? Everyone stay right there. Who the hell is this Önder guy? Who the hell is he? There's a big swarm of officers. Get away from them, go! Should we do a test? What do you think? As if things weren't crazy enough around here we all might get Covid. Isn't that great? EFTELYA: He doesn't have Covid! Thank god. It only shows one line. I'm so sorry for making a scene. I was like, "Covid, oh, no!" 'Cause I saw a line next to the C. Just thought it meant "Covid detected." Meaningless tests. Shut up. Get the costumes from upstairs. OZAN: Ada, take the belly dancer to Eftelya, maybe she'd like to get ready, too. Muzaffer! Darling. You can come out now, it's safe. There's nothing to be afraid of, it was just the power. -Ada will take you upstairs to Eftelya. -All right. -Oh, is Eftelya here? -Yeah, she is. -Come. Come upstairs. -ÖNDER: Excuse me. SELO: Boss. Hey, boss. Huh? Didem's gonna return in two minutes here. I have to ask, did we do something to offend any of you? Oh, of course not. 'Cause there was eating, music, dancing, neighborliness. Hospitality. Of course, everything's beautiful. So you know how to use that weapon? I was a soldier. Don't interrupt. Okay. You came to our house. My wife did all the preparations. We survived a pandemic and we're alive. Let's celebrate like human beings you frickin' dickheads. Pardon me, pardon my bad language. Because we all know our manners. We don't break the law, or even run a red light. We do our best in school and at our jobs, we're kind to animals and we always pay our taxes. All the others, the thieves, the agitators and the Mafia, they step on us and treat us badly, and then we always stay silent. But in our forest, they're jackals, vultures and hyenas. But we... We're lovely as deer. -Papa loves deers, too. Right, Papa? -Not now. We just wanted to celebrate a New Year's Eve. Now, why are you, please forgive me, shitting on this celebration? Papa is right in his plea, with all due respect, sir. Boy, shut your piehole! God damn it! My wife will have fun tonight! You'll all pretend to be perfect neighbors. Kind, hospitable, the best kind of neighbor, do you understand me? In this country, we've been tolerant of everyone for years. Please, for the love of God, do the same for everyone else tonight! -All right, sure. -I have nothing to lose here at all! I'll literally fuck anyone who gets out of line. I'll politely finish off anyone who causes a crime scene at my house. Excuse me. Using too much masculine language. Well, it added some spice to the night. Didem, my mother-in-law is pulling in. I'll show you your mother-in-law. If one more person causes any more trouble tonight, I swear that I will... I don't want to use vulgar language. (SIGHS) Now get cleaning. (MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY) Let's just stay close. Stay close. Stay close. OZAN: Gentlemen. Have a good time. -Ah. -Ah. OZAN: Honey! Seçilay! Welcome back. DIDEM: Thank you. SEÇILAY: Thank you. -(LAUGHS) What a wild night. -Exactly. Did you boys organize a welcome party? Seçilay, my blood pressure is not feeling well. You're fine, Serdar. I feel like I could have a stroke. -Why? -(SERDAR GROANS) You took your night pills, didn't you? I don't know. I don't have them with me. -Are you kidding me? -Oh, no. I have some with me. Don't worry. Did you take one or half? Take one the nights that you wanna drink. I don't know, baby. You're the one that knows all that, right? Come lie down. I... I can give you your pill. Come lie down a bit. SERDAR: Seçilay, I won't die, right, darling? You won't. You'll be fine. Calm down. It's nothing. Oh, God. She always does this. The doctor should probably be the one -to check him over. (LAUGHS) -Mm-hmm. -Where'd he go? -Where is he? -You're going to regret it a lot, Ahmet. -(DOOR OPENS) Get in here, girl. Come over here. All right. Did you tell her about us, Ahmet? Sure, I heard it all. As long as you don't tell the hosts, we're all good. Say nothing happened if you talk to the undercover police. -Zilch. -What? All of this doxic man, he's all yours, dear. Uh, what are you talking about? I'm saying our relationship is over. You are free now and so am I. Win-win. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Can I grab this? Sure. Hello? Yeah, I'm still here. Where are you? I've been trying to reach you. As Togay, that is as your official son-in-law, -know that I am always on your side, Papa. -Mm. -Thank you. -For real. Thanks a lot. (OZAN GRUNTS) That's enough. Stop. It's really good this was cleared up. Otherwise your guys would've killed us. I'm certain of that. Yeah, sure. Of course I respect you, dear Uncle. Good to hear from you and God bless you. (GROANS) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) -I am so ready. -Ah! It's the moment of the evening. Are you ready for the countdown? ALL: Yes! Okay, start the countdown. Go! ALL: Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year, honey. My love! Happy New Year! Ms. Husran, Happy New Year to you. It's always like this. (ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (PLAYING DRUM BEAT) (ALL CHEERING) Okay! Happy New Year, everyone! NESLIŞAH: You, too, darling. (SOBBING) Give me your phone. Give it here. DIDEM: Ms. Arzu! Hello? (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Yes, hopefully we'll have projects together this coming year. Thank you. Ozan is with me right here. Uh, sure, I've got our company's prospective CEO here, Mr. Saadettin, he wants to say Happy New Year to you. Here you go. (MOUTHING) Good evening. Happy New Year. At what location? Ah, well no, I thought you wouldn't be keeping me. It's not like I'm the best CFO in Türkiye. You're being too kind to me. Yes, sir. Means a lot to me. If you're happy, I'm happy. Looking forward to it. Thank you again. Hope it's good for everyone. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. (DOOR OPENS) -You got dressed. -Oh, yeah. Was that a super wild night or what? Totally, with the power and all, right? It was weird. No, not that. I'm talking about all the troublemakers we invited. Troublemakers? Nah. How could you not have noticed, Ozan. Like, who would've thought that Önder's in the Mafia? Uh, yeah. That girlfriend he brought in? -I don't know. -A little crazy. And the wife of Alican? Really weird. And our Serdar? He's worse than all of them put together. I called the yard a circus, but the party was one. Sorry. No! You said our New Year's Eve would be legendary and it was. -So you're feeling okay? -Of course, I am. 'Cause the thing is, when we invited the neighbors, I knew it would be like the lottery. How is it like the lottery? It's a gamble with all of the neighbors. You never know what you're gonna get. Life's like that as well, isn't it? And it would be so boring otherwise, don't you think, my love? It's true. And don't you think marriage is also like that? Mm-hmm. And luckily, you and I hit the jackpot, the love of my life. We absolutely did. I do think we should talk with Ada as soon as we can. That boy is in love with her, but our tomboy does not see it at all. Oh! By the way, the deer is gone. Whatever. Whatever! We don't need it! Right? It doesn't matter. (SIGHS IN RELIEF) The deer's the real king of the forest. He'll be just fine. Ho, ho, ho! (EXHALES) Whoa! (SINGING IN TURKISH) (MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING IN TURKISH) (ALL CLAMORING) (IN ENGLISH) Dance! (SINGING IN TURKISH)
