Mehmet, these rocks look good. But you can never be sure. We'd better send them to the assayer. That's the only way we can know for sure. Gold or copper? And the ratios. - But let the boss know. - Of course I will. Tell him the vein's in a good place. I'll talk to Mr. Faruk as soon as he comes in. Like I said, let's send these samples to the assayer. Come back in two days for the results. - You got it? - Alright. Let's drink some tea to warm up before you leave. You've gotten cold. And you? What do you think? - I think they look real good. - If is Allah's will! Oh ho, the runaway has returned! - Welcome. - Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you. What's up? You're the one with something to tell. Everything here is OK. - They're all asleep, aren't they? - Yes. Why aren't you? I didn't go to bed. I wasn't sleepy. You must be hungry, right? It's been three days since you left. You're probably starving. So, what did you do in the mountains? And with no umbrella. Where did you take shelter in that driving rain? In a cave. I built a fire and slept there till morning. This ore thing's got ahold of you. As soon as summer comes, you got off wandering in the mountains. You go a-wandering and never think about everything left waiting behind. Of course I do, Mama. Do you think I go there for the fun of it? So, did you manage to find anything? If is Allah's will, this time I haven't come back empty handed. This time it doesn't look like the others. Our problems are going to be over, Mama. There's just too much to do around here. And I just can't be of enough help to your wife. We couldnt finish the works. Don't worry about it, I'll finish whatever is left to do. It'll get done. Hanife, haven't you heard us? Our runaway has come home. We've been really worried about you. We've got a lot to do here, and also a lot to worry about. I just couldn't leave. I wanted, but I couldn't. And it's good that I didn't. There's always work here. So what if we finish it two days later? What if two bunches of hay goes to waste. But if that vein turns out to be good... we'll all be saved. The important thing is for you to come home safe. What are you doing in here? Mama, don't you see, this goat is eating all the bread here. I didn't see it, son. The boys keep letting it in. Out! Hurry it up. Go, go! Come on, get out! Hanife, leave the hay for a bit. The tea is ready. Mehmet, you've been working since morning. You will get what you deserve. If is Allah's will. He will smile on us. If is Allah's will, mama. Let's see what tomorrow brings. The vein will turn out to be a good one. Then we'll pay off our loans and buy what we need. Do you think Rasim will buy animals for the Sacrificial Feast? I didn't ask him. Make sure you don't sell the bull to him. He would just count it against our debt, buy it from you cheap and sell it at a high price. We put so much work into that animal. So much hard work. Sell it in the marketplace. Drink it. Hanife! Hanife... Hanife... - What do you want? - Turn towards me. What's happened to you? Let me have a look. - Turn around so we can talk. - I can hear you like this. What? Didn't you hear me coming in last night? I did. Why didn't you get up then? I don't know. You stayed up there in the mountains. Just wait till I sell that ore. Everything will change. You'll see. I'll have a house built. We'll buy a few more cows. We'll leave all these troubles behind. What I want... is that you stay here. Give up climbing the mountains. Work in the mine for three or four months in the summer. Let me just sell the ore first. Then I won't need to go to the mountains anymore. If only we could pay off our debts. We'll pay them off. That'll be easy. I only have to sell this ore. What I want is... ouch! - What happened? - Something is wrong with my knee. It hurts! - Where does it hurt? - It's right there. - In this spot? - Yes... - Just a little lower. - What happened there? - Did you fall or something? - Yes, I took a fall today. - Is it better now. - You should be more careful. - It hurts there again. - Where? Stop that! What are you doing? How many underthings do you have on? The kids aren't asleep yet. Your mom will hear us. - Don't worry. They're all asleep. - Slowly. Daddy... Go back to sleep, Son. Hanife, Hanife... I've missed you so much. Be quiet, quiet... They're still awake. Mom is sound asleep. Don't worry. Quiet. Be quiet. They're going to wake up. Quietly... Be quiet! Come with me, or you'll fall asleep. In the name of Allah... - What's up, Mehmet? - I'm fine. How are you? Same as always, Mehmet. If is Allah's will, everything will get better. Mehmet, we got the report on your samples. If is Allah's will they're all positive. Not really. The results aren't what we hoped for. The rocks contain a trace of silver and 2 or 3% of copper. The vein just isn't profitable enough to mine. So, the results are bad. Right. Mr. Faruk was disappointed too. Never mind, you just keep on prospecting. I've got to go. The guys are all working inside. Okay? - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you. - How are you, Uncle Rasim? - I am fine. Looks like you've rounded up some bulls and are hitting the road. I have to, uncle. The bullfights are going to start soon. I am taking them to the highlands so their legs can get so exercise. Seeing that you do this every year. You must be making money from it. It's not for the money, Uncle Rasim. It's an obsession. An obsession passed on to me by my father. How much are the prizes this year? In the past, they used to award 5 or 6 thousand liras. But as I told you, and as you know, I'm not in it for the money. But now the mayor has gotten involved, and set the prize at 15,000 liras this year. That's a good sum of money. As you see written here, the prize has been increased some. Winner gets 15,000 lira, runner-up gets 9,000 lira, and the third gets 7,000. That's a good amount of money. Good for you! You are betting your hopes on the ass of a bull. As for me, I keep busy and only make a bit of money. Buy it for 5 and sell it for 6 liras. Come off it, uncle. You've never sponsored a bullfight. Would it be too much for you to donate 10 sacks of barley and 10 bales of hay? Well, Bekir, I'm already sponsoring the entire village. Anyway, I came lo leave these posters with you. What are they for? Hang them on your window, door, and walls. Put them where everybody see them. Maybe that way we can draw a crowd. You got it. Brother Rasim, lend me a hand, will you? It looks like Mehmet has struck a vein! Anyway, add these to my tab. I'll pay you after the bullfights. Fucking bastard... Have a nice day, Mehmet. Thanks, goodbye. Ibrahim, your father's coming! Where is he, mom? Musti, look! Daddy bought a ball! I guess Rasim's happy now. Musti, look, a ball. I knew this was going to happen. Every winter you start buying supplies... and then have Rasim add them to our bill. When the autumn comes, you sell the cattle and pay off the debt. Just because you got a little money from a vein you found a few years back. You have spent all your time in the mountain like a fool. You think you're a mining engineer, but you act like a goat jumping from rock to rock. There are no cows left in the barn! But don't even think ok selling the bull to pay Rasim. That bull is mine. I raised him. We'll sell him to pay a doctor for our son. The mine is open for 4 months in the summer. Go work there. You'd earn 70 to 80 lira a day. But no, who would watch over the mountains? In the morning you're going to come with us to cut the hay. And we don't have wood for the winter. Hurry it up, Son. Why are you moving so slowly? Don't work like you are doing it for yourself. Asiye and Yasar argued this morning about the fact... that our work is still only half done. It's going to snow soon. We have to finish this... - Take this, will you? - as soon as possible. My knees are hurting a lot this year. I guess it'll snow soon. Me too. Asiye sold her animals at the Ayvasil Market. She got good money for them. Do you know how much she got? No, but you should take the bull and sell it there. And come here now. You're not pressing it down enough. Mehmet, Son, this morning I had a hard time lighting the fire. There's no good kindling left. They are hard to light. Come down here. I'll do that. You can't even manage to press it down right. And you're good for is wandering up and down the mountains. We have to finish with the hay, so we can start on the wood we need. I'll take the donkey tomorrow... and get us some kindling. What kindling? What mountain? Don't use this as an excuse for going up into the mountains. I know very well why you want to go there. Your intentions are perfectly clear. Shit! Damn it! - No! - Come on, close your eyes. Otherwise the soap will hurt your eyes. Mustafa, come to Mommy! You're cold. Don't cry, son. OK, don't cry. Don't cry... Don't cry, son. Oh my... They know where the blood is and then attach themselves there. Look Mehmet, this is how Kalandar is. The snow came before it did. You put all your thoughts on a vein or ore. What are we going to do now? It'll soon snow here too. Debtors are waiting to get their money, and the creditors are waiting for theirs. Mehmet! Forget about this. Leave it, come to dinner. This wolf has been a pain in the ass recently. Anyway, he's nearly ruined me. The wolf ate several of my goats, the damned thing. I struggle all alone: Fight with the wolf, the dog, the herd. But you are lucky to be on your own here. - Yes, I'm lucky, but Mehmet... - You don't have to listen to anybody. there is too much to do here. My kids never help me. They want to move to town. And the time has come for them to get married. We got married and look what happened! I argue with the missus every day. She tells me to stop chasing after animals and take care of the work at home. What am I supposed to do? I can't keep up with everything by myself. What can I do? So you argue with your wife too? You have no idea, Mehmet. We continually fight about the kids. And they don't help me. I always thought only my missus was like that. Just like you, I have no peace at home. That's how most women are, Mehmet. Nag and nag... They never shut up. If your wife was like mine, she wouldn't let you into the house. Anyway, you are the talk of the village: Mehmet went to the mine, he found a vein, he left, he wasted his time... My advice is that you give up on this prospecting and get a real job. Sell the bull and pay off your debts. You know that I have already found one vein. It's not for nothing. I've made money from it in the past. But I haven't been able to find anything for the past 3 years. This year I was just about to find something, but then it snowed early. The snow covered the places I had dug out. And I can't get to them. It's not too early, Mehmet, it's the season for snow. It was early for me. Maybe, but snow's not going to wait for you. You've got to time yourself. Hanife is right telling you to give up on this... and take a job at the mine. If your father-in-law, your brothers-in-law don't talk to you, it's because your hands have come up empty again. That's why there's so much commotion in your house. You'd better take stock of this. But my brothers-in-law and the mine, what's it got to do with it? That's not what's got them riled up. You think I don't know what's bothering them? They're mad about you looking for a vein, about you wasting your time there. And now you're giving them something else to harp about. You're going to screw everything up. You need to get a hold of yourself. If I had found a vein, you think they'd talk like that? You think I don't know them? As the proverb says, nobody likes a loser. Had I found a vein, they would have stuck like glue to me. Or brother Muzaffer. Now they realize there's nothing they can get out of me... that I am in heavy debt. - Yes. - If I were well, off... anyway... Ibrahim! Take that gas lamp to Asiye and borrow some gas for it. What are you doing over there? - Hope you're not pushing yourself. - Thanks. I came to help you. And what is up with that? Hand that to me. You milk the cows. - As if you were used to it. - What have I done to you now? Here then. Is this something I have ever seen you do before? The Sacrificial Feast is coming soon. Just 10 days now. You need to go with Asiye and Muzaffer to the Ayvasil Market. They're taking their animals to sell. OK, I'll go, but I heard the prices are low. Take Ibrahim with you, he'll be able to help you. I heard they're not giving much for the sheep sold for the feast. Our creditors are waiting for you to sell. - Hanife, I want to talk to you. - What is it? I say, let's not sell this bull. And then what are we going to do? I saw Bekir of Amanos at Gümüşki. He had loaded up a bunch of bulls... and was taking them to the bullfight. He fights his bulls and makes good money. As if they were bulls to speak of. One was only as big as our bull's leg. And so what's your plan? I mean what if... we try our bull? What are you saying? I'm saying, let's put our bull into the match... What? Are you kidding? You can't be serious! If he wins, the prize will pay all our debts. And we'll still have the bull. If we sell him, the money we get won't even pay half our debts. You take him directly to the Ayvasil Market tomorrow. Sell him for whatever price he draws, and pay whatever we have just to shut the creditors up. That money is to take our boy to the doctor. Just listen to me for a second. Bullfighting is very profitable. If he wins, or even if he only comes in third. The winner gets 15,000, runner-up 9,000, third place 7,000. Your prospecting has already made us a fortune, so you'll also bring home loads this way! Bekir has made a fortune from it. Let's just try this once. We have nothing to lose. Anyway, we are deep in debt. Bekir's a fool. And you want to be a fool like him. Just cuz he's a fool, do you have to be one too? Are you the same? - He... - Just mind your own business. No more wasting your time! You're going straight to Ayvasil. Show him off in a good corner. Sell him at whatever price he draws. Just keep your mind on lowering our debts. Our creditors are waiting. Next time one of them may come and take your wife! You didn't find shit in a mine and now talk about bullfighting. I was just about to find a vein... Don't get me mad. I am on the verge of completely losing my temper! You don't work to pay off the debts, and now you come with this! Rubbish! All you're after is some kind of adventure. That's it! Just for now try not getting mad. You always react the same way. - Just listen to me once. - I've listened to you so far. The moment I open my mouth, you start attacking me. There will be no bullfighting! Get out of here, out! Get out! Get out of this barn this very minute! You just came to get a good look at the bull and keep talking about the bullfight! I was asking myself why you came here! For days, you've been looking at that animal. I thought you were trying to guess how much he is worth. But no! I'm going to take him to the bullfight. He may even come in first place. Do whatever the hell you want to do! He says he's going to take him to the bullfight. God damn you, do whatever the hell you want! The bullfights? Go! The mountains? Go! Go wherever the hell you want! Go wherever you want! Do whatever you want! I'm telling him to sell in the market. But no, he says he'll take it to fight! Hanife, why are you acting like this? All I want is for you to agree with me for once. What have I said to you? Why are you acting like this? You get yourself all upset and then cry. Why don't you just say yes for once? Let's do this from the heart. Stop objecting to everything I suggest. We have no other way out. Maybe this time we can succeed. Let's give it a try. What else can I do? I work like hell, but we are destitute. I'm killing myself. We are the laughing stock of everyone. You think that's what I want? I promise, I swear to you... that after this, I will do whatever you want me to do. Whatever you want. You know what I want. I am too ashamed to even visit my parents. They would ask me where you are. While you are chasing rainbows... The villagers consider us a disgrace. They gossip about us. I swear on my father's grave. If I cannot work this out... I swear I will do whatever you want me to. I swear this on my father's grave. I'll get a job at the mine and work for wages. I promise you. I'll do whatever you want. If you would only listen to me... You never listen to anything I say. You never appreciate anything I do. You've never ever listened to me. That's why... I run away to the mountains. What if you were to say yes, just for once? What would happen? You never agree... to anything I try to do. You just disapprove. All I wanted was to find a vein! I did once, and I would have found another... but it started snowing... I want to take the boy to the doctor as much as you do. I also want to build a house, repay our debts. How could I not? Let me give you some milk... so you can warm up. Or would you prefer some cream? Grab it. Put it down over there. Come here boy. Easy now, easy. Good boy. Right on. OK now. That's it. Run, run, run. Like this. Easy now boy. Easy now. Easy now. Look how strong he looks since you started to tend him. Good job, Son. He's worth every bite he eats. He runs good. He fed him with bran. Of course he's going to run good. I wish him a long mane and good horns. Good for you, Son. Good boy. Good for you. Come on boy. OK, you're tired. So am I. Good job, boy. Good job. Slowly, he is tired. He's about to drop. Slowly, slowly. Mehmet! Mehmet! Hey, Mehmet! Mehmet! What's wrong? Yesterday, after that snowfall, the wolf attacked my flock. Come and help me find my lost goats. Let's have a bite first. I've got to hurry. My goats are alone. The boys have gone off in other direction. You know best of all, the foothills and the meadows. Let's look together. OK, I'm coming. Hold on a sec. Mehmet, keep a sharp eye out. Look, he threw one here. More of them should be around here. I don't know where exactly. He's eaten this one. Only skin and bones left. Fucking animal. It's ruined me. Look at this, and it was such a good goat. Fucking beast... Mehmet, pick up that one and follow me. Come here. Good boy. Come on my boy, let's run. Come on, run boy! Ibrahim, you should not have brought these pears here. Why not, grandma? Kids will come on Kalandar night. We can put some of these pears in their bags. Nuts too. Then a momayer will come. That one's hard to feed. What's a momayer? A kind of monster. They've got big ears. And they're also tall and big. We have to give them lots of food. If you don't feed them, they will attack and eat the calves. Where do they take that food? They have a barn under the monastery. They keep these animals in that barn during the winter. Was it them who built the monastery? No, not them. Greek people used to live in this village before we did. It was built back in their time. It used to be very pretty. I would go there when I was a child. It has 360 rooms. It was surrounded by 7 or 8 chapels. Who tore it down? The government burned that monastery down. After the fire, the villagers took its stones and used them to build houses. They burned it down and now it's just a ruin. What happened to the Greeks? A war broke out. They chased the Greeks away. After that, the place was left deserted. Till the Momoyers moved in there. Was it us who won the war? I think so. They chased the Greeks away. So why haven't we chased the momayers away? That's how it is. Son, never go there. We have never been able to find out who or what they really are. Make sure you never go near such horrible places. Always remember what I have told you. We buried it too deep. Hey, look what we've found here. I wonder what this is? Come and see. What can this be? You want me to give you some? Eat some of this. Take some and taste this cheese. Looks like manna from Heaven. It's very nice. It came out really nice. Mehmet, I wasn't expecting this much snow. It's Allah's doing, Mom. In the name of Allah... In the name of Allah... Oh, how nice. Mom, will it fall on the ground? Oh... It's coming! - Allah's blessing! - Granny, let's pull on it a little. It's a boy. Nazar has given us a boy. What's happened? Is that yours to keep? Mustafa... Dad, I'm collecting snails. I'll sell them and buy a pair of trousers. It's still not set that you're coming with me. If you help your mother and tend the cattle well, you can come with me. What good are these snails? I found a lot of them and put them in the bucket. Once the rain stops I'm going to find more. You'll find them, son. They come out after the rain. Where else are they? Look alongside rocks. Look in the graveyards. Look around empty old houses. And below the monastery. They come out after a rain. You need to tend this Poyraz for one more month. Never leave his food trough empty. Make sure he always has feed, morning and night. We have to take good care of him. The rest is up to Allah. He's working him every morning and evening. The bull is tired to death. He's going to drop soon. Those flies have eaten him alive under this sun. Mehmet! Get that bull back. You're all getting sun burned. The tea is brewed. We'll drink it when you come. The mine's most likely opened. Didn't Faruk send word? He did. So, aren't you going to start work there? I'll start... after the bullfight. First we need to go to the town, then we'll see. Take Mustafa with you to Artvin, to the doctor. He doesn't need a doctor. What he needs is a good healer. When I get back from Artvin, I'll take him to a good healer. Hey Musti, look at these. Look, look... Come on, look at these. We found a whole bunch. Look. Look at these. Come and see how many there are. One, two, three, four, five... Will he fight, daddy? Of course he will. Why not? We've worked him so much. I already filled one of the barrels. I'll fill a second one too. I'm going to take them to Artvin. And buy myself some trousers. What do they do with these snails, daddy? They eat them. - Eat them? - Yep. How can they? They just do. They boil them in water and eat them. - You mean, people eat them? - Yes. But not our people. I think the infidels eat them. I'm not sure. Mustafa! Mustafa, drop that ball. Oh, you probably blew it. Did you burst your ball? Bring it here. When will Musti get better, daddy? I don't know, son. Only Allah knows. We took him to many healers. Are we going to take him to Artvin? Your mother wants us to. She's heard about a healer there. But I don't know how to find him. Let's take him. Maybe we can find that healer. Is it expensive there? I don't know. Bulls may crush him there. We'd better not take him. You'll protect him, Son. Travel may do him some good and... and also he will be company for you. Son, always treat your brother good. Allah created him that way. It could have happened to you. It's about to rain. Why are you sitting there? - Bring the bull to the barn. - OK, Mama. It still might happen to you. Come on, Musti. Hit it. Come! Pull your pants up. Pull them up. Pull'em up. The rain's on its way down. Lets go. Come on Musti. Pick up your ball. What are you doing there? I thought that I would just straighten up this mess. So you picked it up again. Mustafa! Put the chickens in their coop. Don't think too much, son. Allah is great. He protects us. Isn't it beautiful, Mustafa? How much is that? - Ten liras. - Isn't that too much? Not really, but I can drop the price a bit. All right, son. Put it down. Mehmet Sert, Hilmi Aydin. Please bring your bulls to the starting point. Mehmet Sert, Hilmi Aydin. Please bring your bulls to the starting point. Dear participants. Now we welcome the bull number 7, belonging to Mehmet Sert, who is joining our festival from Trabzon. Let's lend our hands in a round of applause for Mehmet Sert. Mustafa, look, look. C'mon boy! Hilmi Aydin, please now bring your bull to the arena. Come on Poyraz, come on boy! Welcome back, travelers. What happened, Ibrahim? Move over a bit. Let the child warm up. How did you lose the fight? Ibrahim? Grandma, you eat too. Why isn't Grandma eating? She's been fasting since you left. She vowed to fast for our bull to win. Our bull was going to win. But the other bull was way too big. It overwhelmed ours. It was just too big for him. Move away from here. The rain is all coming in. What the heck! - Ibrahim! - What's wrong? Those snails have spilled all over the place. The barrels have spilled. Come here and pick'em up. What's happened here? How did this happen? The dog must've knocked them over. They've gone to the bottom of the barn. Pick those up too. - Mama! - What? Who untied the bull? He was there when I got up to pray. He's not here. He got loose and ran away. - Who could've untied him? - How is he not? Well, he's not. It's gone. - Good Allah! - Who tied him up? How could he have gotten loose? In Allah's name, how did you tie him? Where is he? I have no idea. He was here when I woke up. Could he have fallen off the edge? - How did you tie him up? - Where did he go? How should I know? How did you tie him? How could he have gotten loose? Oh Allah! Leave off doing that right now. Get out of the way. What's it to me? I'm going to pick them up. Granny, hand me my coat. Here, boy Poyraz! Come! Come boy, come, come! Come on, come on! Here boy! Musti, you stay right here. I'm going to look for Poyraz. Here boy, here boy! Poyraz! Poyraz! Come, come! Here boy, come here! Here boy, here boy! Come here, Poyraz! - Isn't he down there? - He is nowhere. Where in the hell could he be? - Did you look behind the house? - Yes, I did. Go and look down the slope. I'll go to the infidel's house. Here boy! Here boy! Here boy! Come! Come on Poyraz! Come! Poyraz! Nurdan! Nurdan! What happened, granny? We've lost our bull. Have you seen it? No, we didn't, granny. If you see or hear anything, let us know. OK, granny. Poyraz! Poyraz! Come here! - Hanife! - What? Have you found the bull? No, no! Mehmet! Ibrahim! Mehmet! Here boy! Here boy! Poyraz! Here boy! Come here! Poyraz! Here boy, here boy! Uncle Katip! - Have you seen our bull? - I haven't seen him. Go straight into the forest and look there. Uncle Katip, you're a sight for sore eyes. You were my only hope, but if you haven't seen him... Good Allah, my bull is gone... He's been eaten by wild animals! Eaten up! Poyraz, here boy! Come boy! Come, come... Here Poyraz! Come, come! Here Poyraz, come! Here Poyraz, here Poyraz! Here boy! Come! Here Poyraz, come! Come on Poyraz, come! Here Poyraz, come! Come boy! Come on Poyraz! Come my boy! Come! Mehmet! Here boy! Here, here! Here boy! Here, here, here! Poyraz! Poyraz! Come, come, come! Stay there, son. I will go down and save Poyraz. All right? Okay, stay right there. You just stay there.
