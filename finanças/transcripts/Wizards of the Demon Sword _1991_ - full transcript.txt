[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] This way. [WHIMPERING] What happened to her? She must have jumped. You idiot! We're in for it now. This isn't my day. No! Argh! Ah! No! Ahh. No! Rah! Agh! [FEMALE STRUGGLING] Stop. [WHIMPERING] Excellent. Excellent. First Ulric and now his lovely daughter, Melina, in the bargain. Good day's work, Gorgon. Now take her back to the castle. Immediately? Yes, Gorgon, immediately. It shall be done. Ya, ha. What have you done with my father? He's being taken directly to Lord Khoura. What he does with them after that is none of my concern. You, however, interest me. [SPIT] It is unwise to deny a man of my rank. You bind a woman helpless and then call yourself a man? You do try my patience. [WHOOSH] Ooh! Handle this. Let me go! Let's go. [GRUNTING] Oh, thank you, kind sir. I'm Melina. You saved my life. To whom do I owe this debt of gratitude? I am Thane. Thane of Hawksridge. Surely you've heard of me. No, I think not. Well, no matter. You shall remember me from this day forward. Indeed, I shall. And now, my fair lady, I should be on my way. But wait. You can't just leave me here. What would happen should Khoura's men return? Khoura? Are you telling me that I've wandered into his evil realm of corruption? Yes, and each day the fingers of his iron hand reach farther across the land, spreading a blight of misery and destruction. And now they have my father. They have your father? Ulric the Elder. And with him, I fear, something that's been entrusted to my father. He and I were ambushed not far from here. Ulric the Elder. Ah, yeah. The keeper of the Blade of Aktar. [OMINOUS MUSIC] This is serious. Ichtar Barazul. From the gate of the mighty Lord of the Gods, Aktar, hearken and remember. Gate of the Lord of All Black Sorcery, open to me. [CRESCENDO] Master, the blade-- it was supposed to-- The Blade of Aktar, the key to eternal dark power. But how do you use it? What is the secret? Your arm, my prince. It still bleeds. Wait. Blood. It's the blood. Only it must be new and pure. I need untainted blood. It shall be done by moonrise tomorrow. Go. MELINA: The sacred blade was on my father at the time of his abduction. THANE: Hm. Then that means that-- MELINA: That Khoura may hold the key to unleashing the most awesome and malevolent powers of darkness known since the dawn of mankind. THANE: Then the very world is held in the balance. I mean, what do we do? MELINA: We must seek the holy man known as the Seer of Roebuck. THANE: The Seer of Roebuck? MELINA: He's the last surviving member of an ancient cult of druids whose teachings my father studied. Perhaps he can help free my father and ensure that the blade is not used for evil purpose. [GROWLING] I have slain many dragons such as these in my day. I'm impressed. [CLUCKING] Hey. [GROWLING] [SHOCKING SOUND] MELINA: What is that? THANE: Some kind of primitive religious icon. MELINA: Was it human? THANE: Looks to be many creatures. See how these bones are attached here? What sort of diseased mind would conceive of something such as this? Ah, these hills are full of tribesmen that practice all sorts of strange rituals. Then we'd best not linger. Ahh, fear not. Primitives that scavenge these bones, they shirk the likes of us. You have nothing to worry about. Let's move out. Help! Thane! Thane! Hey! MELINA: Thane! [GROANING] [THUMP] [THWACKS] [MONSTER GRUNTING] THANE: [POMPOUSLY LAUGHING] MELINA: Don't worry about it, huh? Hey, hey. SLAVE MASTER: And now this next one is a real beauty and a bargain at any price. Bring her up here. ASSISTANT SLAVER: Get up. SLAVE MASTER: Ah, this little darling here has an appetite like a bird. She's strong as an ox, and she makes love like a little bunny rabbit, don't you dear? CROWD MEMBER: I'll take two. Yes, I don't blame you. And I wish I had two like this to sell you. The bidding will start now at 50 pieces of gold. Do I hear 50? Only 50 pieces of gold. CROWD MEMBER: 50. I hear 50 from the gentleman there. 50 pieces of gold. Do I hear 75? 75? CROWD MEMBER: 75 pieces. 75 pieces. 75. 75. Do I hear 100? Do I hear 100? Why this girl is a steal at 200, and it's only 100 I'm asking now. 100 pieces of gold. Look at that treasure chest. [CROWD OOHS AND AHHS] SLAVE MASTER: If I was selling this one by the pound, why, she'd be worth-- CROWD MEMBER: 100. That's more like it. 100 pieces of gold. It's certainly worth it. All right. 100 pieces of gold going once. Do I hear 150? 100 pieces of gold going twice. 100 pieces of gold thrice. Sold to the wise man there for only 100 pieces of gold! MELINA: You sold me to that pig. Fiery temper. Gentleman, next I offer you a package deal. Here we have the mother and a very special, rare treat, the beautiful virgin daughter. CROWD MEMBER: Oh, ho! Virgin. SELENA: Are you certain she's a virgin? Would I lie to you? Are you certain she's a virgin? Haven't been keeping any secrets from mother, have we? No. Good. We'll take her. All right. The bidding will start-- SELENA: This one is for Lord Khoura. He pays for nothing. Wh-- but the mother alone is worth-- I care not for the old hag. I am only interested in the girl. But I can't break up the set. All right. 60 pieces of gold. 50. Uh. All right. Take her. You drive a hard bargain. Take her away. Give my best regards to Khoura. SELENA: Certainly. SLAVE MASTER: Well all right, men. Now we are left with the mother. [CROWD LAUGHS] SLAVE MASTER: Oh, I admit she's a bit older, but she knows tricks that will bring any man ecstasy in bed. She's an excellent cook. A prize to have in any camp. A treasure in your tent. We'll start the bidding on this at 30-- no, 60 pieces of gold. [CROWD SCOFFING] Well? 50. 40. 30 pieces of gold. Perhaps would can partake of rest and nourishment in the town down below. And let us not forget to inquire about the Seer. Ohh. And a bath. [HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING] Stop! Please stop! DOOR MAN: Check your weapons at the door, please. THANE: I don't check my weapons for no one. DOOR MAN: Ha, ha. Then you're not as tough as you look. MELINA: Just give him your damn weapons. She got any ID? She's a virgin. You're late. We've been waiting for you. [SCATTERED GIGGLING] I'm Thane. Thane of Hawksridge. So? We seek the one they call the Seer. Who? The Seer of Roebuck. [GASPS] The Seer of what? No, n-- not of what, of-- of Roebuck. Describe him. He's one of the cult of the ancient druids. He's practiced in the art of sorcery. Ohh, that crazy old hermit. We don't see much of him around here anymore. He really doesn't go for this kind of thing. He likes those big black girls. We're fresh out of them. Maybe next week. Let me show you what we've got. [MUSIC PLAYING] This isn't exactly what I had in mind. I know what you mean. SNAKE LADY: Come run away with me. Every night will be adventures in ecstasy. Uhh, I don't think so, lady. The snakes, they scare the hell out of me. Hey. The Seer of Roebuck. Do you know where he is? North. Perverts. Only one? The best one. The other two are in the dungeon. One should be sufficient, but are you sure she is pure? To lie would have imperiled their families, my Lord. Hm. Wise strategy. Adequate. However, we will bleed only one at a time. The other two shall remain fresh. Prepare for blood. You better be right about this virgin. You know, you should consider this quite an honor, my dear. [GRUNT] Well, it looks like I'm stuck with you. You must be a slave trader. You're right. I don't have much use for slave traders, but perhaps you know the whereabouts of a holy man. Whatever turns you on. You want a holy man? I'll get you a holy man. MELINA: Not just any holy man. THANE: We're looking for a holy man, the Seer of Roebuck. Oh. And just how much would that Seer of Roebuck be worth to you? THANE: Not as much as he's worth to you, my bald-headed sack of dung. Oh, no. Not this shit again. Well? All right. I've heard of the guy. But it will take you a couple of days to get to him. Now, you take the main road out of town. It'll take you due north to the Wasteland. And then you hook a right at the last outpost of full humanity, then you can't miss him. Did you get all that? Cook me some cameltop soup. Perhaps the blood of untainted males would be more effective. Are you, by chance, volunteering? If not the blood, then what is the secret? I suggest that we return our energies at once to Ulric. He is already your prisoner. You have obtained the blade. Surely he knows the key. I have tried everything. A sorcerer-- even a benevolent sorcerer-- can withstand the most strenuous of tortures. Hm. Well, if not Ulric, perhaps his daughter. She knows nothing. Besides, she's already escaped. She means nothing to me. Hm. Yes, but she is of great value to Ulric. Perhaps there's something in what you say. You know, this is getting to be a lot of trouble trying to find your Seer friend. I'll tell you what. Let's just go to the castle and we'll rescue your father ourselves. And the blade? We'll rescue that, too. Could be dangerous. I thrive on danger. I'm a warrior. When other men shriek and fear, I ride forth, my sword drawn in a mighty warrior's cry. Hyeah! That's right. Men fear the name of Thane, especially those who wrong the innocent. Ah yes, woe be to the scoundrel who comes in reach of my blade. Fie on the knave who crosses my path. [ROARING] Yes. Woe 10,000 scoundrels had been mine. Look! What? Do those scoundrels and knaves include beasts such as that? [ROARING] Yes. Yes, of course. No brute is any match for my sword. Oh, shit. [SQUACKS AND ROARS] [SCREECH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LOW HOWL] MELINA: Surely we have come to the edge of the Earth. We must take care not to fall off. THANE (LAUGHING): You can't be serious. Come on. There's a hut up ahead. THANE: Hello? [MAGIC ZAP] SEER: Who attempts to enter my humble domain? It's Thane of Hawksridge. And Melina, daughter of Ulric, Keeper of the Blade of Aktar. SEER: You I've heard of. I bid you welcome. You're free to enter. Ahem. MELINA: Excuse me. We seek the one called the Seer. Do you know him? Uh, I have-- I have heard of him, yes. MELINA: We seek his advice of utmost urgency. Ulric and possibly the blade have fallen into the clutches of Khoura. Dark Prince of the Underworld! I--it's one in the same. Oh, I am the Seer you seek. How can I help you? How can we be certain that you are the Seer? Oh. [SPARKS] Oh! Ohh, no. I hate that. Can we talk? Eyes of Kali Shambur, drink in the light of the moon and extend my vision into the night. Tell me, my child. What do you know of the legend of the blade? I know there was once a hero-- a wizard by trade-- that braved the fires of Hell to forge a weapon, the only weapon capable of defending the Earth against the malevolent creature Aktar, which held the planet in its clutches. The weapon was used to slay the creature by plunging it deeply into its third eye, as it had no heart. But one can never completely destroy a demon of this magnitude. And to this day it lies dormant in a limbo netherworld, its awesome power held in check. Though it is said he who wields the blade has the means to unleash the power and to use it for his own sinister purpose. Yes, that's exactly the way I remember it. Then we must make haste to Khoura's castle. The fate of the world depends on it. No, no. You cannot go there. But I must. To do so would bring you grave danger and imperil the very fate of mankind here on Earth. How can that be possible? My quest is meant to save mankind. Because, my child, the blade of Aktar is useless to Khoura without you. (LAUGHS) It's gone. Worry not, my Prince. I shall find the wench and return her here. Selena, please. Allow me. I shall marshal troops and we shall find her. Your troops are the one who let her escape in the first place. I shall bring back. Do you understand? I care not the means. Just get her back. MELINA: Explain yourself, master. At a time before you were born, the enlightened ones entrusted Ulric, your father, with safekeeping of the blade. And like all bladekeepers before him, he took a solemn oath to protect it with his very life and the life of his first born child. While the blade is the key that will unlock the gates to the fury that is Aktar, the holder of the blade must first plunge the sacred object into the pure heart of that which its appointed guardian holds dearest. This was thought to be a means of ensuring that no bladekeeper would ever let the artifact find its way into the wrong hands. Well, it's a little late for that. Foolproof plans are hard to come by, son. However, there may be some small comfort in the fact that Khoura, not schooled by the enlightened ones, may not know the secret of the blade. But, in any event, your presence in Khoura's castle would be most unwise. Most unwise. I must rescue my father. You have journeyed long. You're tired. It's late. Please partake of a night's sleep, and in the morning do whatever you must, but I beg of you to reconsider. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPER] [GASP] [SNORING] MELINA (LAUGHING EVILLY): I did it. THANE: What? Wha-- no, no, Melina. You've got this all wrong. No. I'm dead. [PLEASURE GROANS] THANE: I can't do this. Ah-ah. No. No. [GIDDY LAUGHTER] THANE: What are you trying to do? Agh, I'm going to cut your heart out and feed it to the vultures. [STRUGGLING] [THWACK] Oh, no. Possessed women. Selena's returned. With the girl? Not quite, I'm afraid. Well-- Well what? She summoned the spirit of the never-ending light and transported her soul. She transported? Now I would never presume to transport spirit myself, since you have expressly forbid it. And, as you know, the punishment for such transgression is quite-- Selena. Selena, how dare you defy my strictest of edict. Is this how you repay my tutelage in the black arts? Do you presume to abuse the power of darkness? OMAR: I've never trusted women. Silence. You were to seek out and recapture the girl. What gain could you possibly expect from this vilest of transgressions? I have found her. You found her? Then where is she? She returns. She returns? To rescue her father. Then all we need do is wait. She brings a warrior. What warrior could possibly be a match for me? You've survive transport of the spirit well. Thank you, my Lord. My energy shall replenish quickly. See that she's attended to. You wouldn't by chance happen to have a bandage, would you? Melina. Melina, awaken. Melina! [SNORING] Melina! Wake up. Wake up. Waken. Are you O-- Hey! [SLAP] Thane, I'm really sorry I slugged you. Oh, you must have been possessed by some evil spirit or something. You know, This whole thing reeks of Khoura's black magic. Ah. And if I was possessed by Khoura or one of his evil minions, surely they know of my intent to penetrate the dark domain and free my beloved father. Ha, ha, yes. They're probably even rolling up the crimson tapestry as we speak. Then it'll be stained in even deeper red with Khoura's spilled blood. Could I please have a ride now, Thane? Well, yes, if you must. [INNOCENT CHIRPING] Well, what do want to eat? I don't know. What do you want to eat? I don't know. What do you want to eat? How about that? [CIRCUS MUSIC] [INNOCENT CHIRPING] Yeah. [CREATURE FALLING] [DEATH MARCH] So, tell me. What type of wine goes with lizard bird? Any child knows that. On nights such as these, I hearken back to my childhood. I wonder what it would have been like had I not been a bladekeeper's daughter. Hm. It does seem to have its disadvantages. But you, uh-- you didn't know anything about that as a child. I speak of the responsibility of the blade safekeeping. Hm. But it was never your responsibility. All those close to the entrusted one had to share the burden in some way. I mean, growing up knowing that your father controls the very fate of the world can be a very awesome responsibility. Most people probably couldn't handle it. Looks to me that you've held up very well. So what of your life? What does it mean to be Thane of Hawksridge, alleged dragon slayer? THANE (LAUGHING): Hey, you have to admit I did make pretty fast work of the lizard bird. Tell me, what else do you know about pleasing a lady? Well, I am a pretty good provider. You are a good provider. [THWACK] [LIP SMACKING] [DEATH SCREAM] Get her, [INAUDIBLE]. [FAST-PACED MUSIC PLAYING] Let's split up. Go that way. [MOANING] No. This is the wench that gave Khoura's men the slip. I'll bet there's a handsome reward out on her head. You take care of Prince Charming over there. Hey! Read my lips! Take care of Prince Charming over there. Now get her ready to ride. Let go of her! Khoura does not like spoiled goods. Get off! I had a hunch he'd say that. Ugh. Great. Just great. [SCREECHING] [RATTLING] Oh. Uhh. This just isn't my day. Uhh. MELINA: Ow! Ah. GORGON: Come along, my dear. Your new quarters await you. No! OMAR: Jailer, the lock. [KEYS RATTLING] OMAR: Guards. Quickly. Virgins, eh? Well, we shall see. (LAUGHS) Oh, we will. Gorgon, show milady her new home. MELINA: Let go. Oh, Melina. Are you all right? I'm well. And you? Have they hurt you? No, dear. It hasn't come to that yet. OMAR: Well done. Does Khoura still possess the blade? Yes, yes, but he cannot make use of it. As long as you are safe then he remains powerless. Oh, I tell you, all of my visions and prophecies. I never thought I'd see my demise within the bars of such a place as this. Oh, it seems like-- like an eternity now since that time when the old ones entrusted me with the blade. I was so bold and foolhardy then, but not without a sense of duty. Anything seemed worth sacrificing if it meant protecting the blade, even if it was the life of my unborn first child. God, it's easy to give up that which you don't yet have. Your actions were right and true. My blood is part of the legacy of the blade. I grew up believing and understanding that. I have my duty now also. But it was never your choice. It was always my choice. [UNSHEATHING SWORD] I could slash your throat as easily as I could slash these ties that bind you. Which will it be? Well, uh, why don't you go over there and have something to eat and think about it, you know? This isn't the sort of decision you would want to make on an empty stomach. Don't mind if I don't get up, but just help yourself. It does look mighty tempting. Got anything to wash this down with? There's a pouch over there. Nice. It's Corinthian leather. [SNIFFS] Got any red wine? Uhh, I'm all out. I wasn't expecting company. So give me three good reasons why I should let you live. Surely you're not so barbaric as to slay an unarmed, defenseless man. Is that supposed to be your first reason? You mean it's not reason enough? No man is defenseless that lives. Oh, there's matters of urgency that I must attend to. Let it wait. The fate of the world lies in the balance. I don't think so. I demand that you untie me, you slimy dog. I can assure you, you are in no position to demand anything. Besides, seeing as how you bask in the presence of the greatest swordsman in all the land, you're better off subdued there on the ground where you can't do anything that would cause me to have to hurt you. (LAUGHING) Yeah, you know there's not a swordsman alive that's a match for me. Aw, you're not that bad, are you? Untie me, you idiot, and I'll show you some of the greatest swordplay you've ever seen, because I am the best in the land. I think you've had too much sun. Oh, yeah? Well, let's see. (LAUGHING) OK. I've got nothing else to do today. I'll give you the pleasure of dying on your feet. DAMON: Don't worry, I'll make this quick and painless. You have but a brief moment left of Earthbound misery. Ohh, you have done this before. THANE: Yes, and I shall live to do it again, my friend. It's too bad that you won't. ALL: Oww. This really hurts. I'm tired. I'm really tired. What do you say we go back to swords? Yeah, OK. I think you're right. Get off, will you? OK. [BUMBLING MUSIC PLAYING] THANE: Get off of me. DAMON: I've decided to let you live. THANE: I'll tell you what, you don't stop on my account, all right? Get off of me, you dog. No man has ever withstood the punishment of my sword. Not mine, either. Oh. Then you must be Thane of Hawksridge. You've heard of me? Who hasn't heard of the warrior from the outer realm who once defeated an entire king's army to defend the virtue of a woman betrayed? Ha, ha! That was nothing. I've long-awaited the day we could cross swords so that I could test your reputation as the warrior you're reputed to be. And? Ehh. Ah, you dog. What brings you to these distant parts? Well, I was just passing through till the plight of a fair maiden distracted me with a foul problem. You mean the fate of the world hanging in the balance and all? Yes, that's the problem of which I speak. This fair maiden and I, we were en route to the evil castle of the evil warlord to rescue her father, and then we were attacked and she was torn from my grasp. A swordsman such as your caliber, you'd become a great benefit trying to rescue this fair maiden. Does she have a sister? I know of none. Not interested. But she has riches. Riches a-plenty for the man that helps find her father and comes to her aid. Diamonds? She's got diamonds. She's got emeralds, rubies. They're all in a Corinthian leather pouch. The world hangs in the balance, you say? Yes, indeed. Well, I've got nothing to do this afternoon. OK. Well, it appears we each possess something the other one wants. You possess nothing that is of any interest to me. Not even the Blade of Aktar? The old one saw fit to prevent its use by those who are ill-equipped. The blade is useless to you. It seems that I possess something else that you may find even more valuable. This I doubt. I control the fate of your daughter. My fate was determined long ago by forces far more virtuous than you. I accept that fate and champion my cause. That's very noble, I'm sure, but what effect will your cause have when you are dead? If she dies then you'll never know the power of the blade. And why is that? Because she is the key to the blade? How did you know that? The night has eyes. Ulric, reveal to me the connection between your daughter and the blade, and I will spare the two of you. Refuse and your daughter's screams will haunt you for all eternity. You loathsome jackal. Save your charms. I'm quite immune. Well? Do we have a bargain? Aye. No! I would rather die by my own hand than concede to your corruption. Very well. Take her to the torture wall. Oh, it's right down the north corridor. I'm sure, if you listen carefully, you'll be able to hear your daughter's skin being ripped off of her body. You bastard! THANE: The castle lies just ahead. We must be on our guard. DAMON: I'll try to keep that in mind. THANE: Do you want to end up like these poor devils down here? DAMON: Get out of here. OMAR: Damnable fog. Keep a sharp eye out. If you see anything move, you know what to do. You, you, come with me. [THWACK] DAMON: That was too easy. THANE: It's a midget. (LAUGHS) DAMON: After you. [GROANING] THANE: That's how it's done. DAMON: Ah All right. Once we get in the castle, we're going to need to split up. Why? So you can find the treasure all for yourself? Such skepticism for a thief. We need to split up so we increase our odds of finding Melina. Nothing more, nothing less. All right? I hope not for your sake. Be on guard, my friend. Don't get lost. I do so hate this room, don't you? I think it's the smell. Oh, black. What an appropriate color for torture. Have you reconsidered? You'll not survive this night, Khoura. No. You have that just backwards. Now, where to begin? [SCREAMING] No! [SCREAMING] LORD KHOURA (LAUGHING): Pretend that's your father. There are far greater things than the lives of two mere mortals. You will suffer the fires of eternal damnation for this. My dear, I am eternal damnation. Now tell me the secret of the blade. [NERVOUS BREATHING] [GRUNTING] LORD KHOURA: Drop it. Drop it. You were bound to show up eventually. This is not the end, you vile creature. So this is the warrior? Khoura, I will see you drawn and quartered. You and what army? Soldiers are massing out front of the castle for an attack even now. Oh, that army. Guards, take him to the dungeon. [STRUGGLING] You're Ulric the Elder. Maybe. I'm Thane of Hawksridge. I'm-- I'm here to rescue you and your daughter. That's a very comforting thought. MELINA: No! Let go of me! Tell me the secret of the blade or I will submit you to the torture and pain the likes of which you have never imagined. I'd rather die first. No, no. That comes later. [SPITTING] We can only submit to our unseen destiny. Well, I distrust what I cannot see. Am I going to have to keep on rescuing you like this? Part of apprenticeship. Oh, the it's educational. I see. Welcome. I'm Ulric the Elder. I am Damon the smarter. Let's get the hell out of here. DAMON: Which way do we go? THANE: I was just gonna ask you. ULRIC: Sorry, I was just a guest here. [THWACK] Any last words? Help! Help! GORGON: Don't stand there, you cowards. Kill them! Ashtar Abell Zhakan, I invoke the Watcher of the Gate. We've got to find Melina. Dashtar, hear my summons. Crystallize the blue energy of the moonlight and harness the power of the dark domain. [THUMPING] DAMON: OK, great sword teacher, how about a lesson with this guy? THANE: You said you were my friend. Not bad for an amateur. Who you calling an amateur? Get up. Most impressive. DAMON: Run. Find Melina. I'll take care of this guy. THANE: Make him bleed. Lord Khoura, the prisoners have escaped. OMAR: Well, you'll forgive me if I don't make it that easy for you. DAMON: Oh, that's good. This was getting a little boring. OMAR: Well, I'll try and keep you entertained, peasant. I'm a little out of practice. DAMON: Well, you could've fooled me. You know, with a little time, I could learn to like this place. MELINA: Father. SELENA: Stop! Step away, Ulric. I have had quite enough of this trouble. Tell me the secret of the Blade of Aktor or I shall slice the two of you up here and now. (YELLING) Tell me! THANE: Selena, step back, witch. Step back and be gone. Or prepare to die. I have many lives, warrior. And perhaps, as soon as I am through killing you, I shall acquire yet another. Thane. Thane. Bastard. [GASPING] Thane, we've gotta find Khoura. The Blade of Aktar, it's on Khoura. You're going to die for this. How interesting. MELINA: Thane! ULRIC: Let's get out of here! [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] [SCREAMING] MELINA: Oh, father. Come on. Let's go. Thane! [THUMP] [STRAINED BREATH] [THWACK] Thane! Get the blade. [RUMBLING] [ECHOED SCREAMING] I think this is yours. [MUSIC PLAYING]
