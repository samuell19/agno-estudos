Drive more cautiously! Madam, this is how you're supposed to drive in Delhi. But are you driving or playing a videogame? You turn randomly, wherever you like! Look madam, this is the only way I know to drive. If you know any better, why don't you take the wheel? Park the auto on the side. What happened madam? Do as I say, this very instant! But what's the matter, madam!? Come on the back seat. I'll show you how to drive. You took offence!! That's not what I meant... Really. You want to learn how to drive, right? I'll teach you. The police station is not very far from here. I'll very easily give you a demonstration up till there! Sorry madam! I committed a huge mistake. I drive someone else's auto. My job will be in peril. I know how to set people like you right. Come to the police station. Madam, I have small kids. I swear I will never repeat such a thing in my life! So then learn to drive like a responsible driver. And listen, while talking to a girl, look into her eyes! Understood! Lets go. - Thank you madam. Hi. - Hi. You're back from the office so early!? I left my job. What!? But why? No Tanny, I'm really worried about you. Look at your CV! If this frequency were to continue.. ..you'll not get a job anywhere. So should I also become a model like you? I've been telling you that since so long! I'll introduce you to photographers, coordinators. You'll love it. It's so much fun! Exactly! Work should always be fun. You enjoy modelling because it's your passion. I guess, even I will keep looking till.. ..I find my passion, my ideal job. I've known you for a year. But I still haven't understood what your ideal job is! See, ultimately my goal is to start an adventure travel company... ...in my parents' name in Chandigarh. But for that, I need money which I don't have! So till the time I collect some savings... ...I guess, my ideal job is something unique... ...one that gives me a new adventure every day... ...a new challenge, you know! So basically your ideal job.. ..should be challenging and different, right? Absolutely! Being different is paramount. In that case, I think I've found your ideal job! Really! - Have a look! What!? - Why, what happened!! Doesn't it list all the qualities that you want in your ideal job? Are you serious? You know, the moment I read this ad, I thought about you. You love cars so much, especially SUVs. And, oh yes, you're blessed with an adventurous spirit! I think you're going to make a great driver. You're making fun of me!? No Tanny, I'm absolutely serious. It's very easy to talk. But very difficult to act. And if you truly do want to do something different in life... ...then I don't think you'll get.. ..a more different opportunity than this! Are you challenging me? Going by the ad, I don't think it gets any more challenging than this! Okay then. Now I'll show you Tanya's adventurous spirit! We shall see! Stop right here! What's the fare? Sixty rupees. What's this damsel doing here? Has she forgotten the way to the beauty parlor or what! 'Tanya, have you gone mad?' 'What are you doing amidst these monsters?' 'Leave this very moment.' 'Yeah right, Tanya, leave!' 'You always take the easy route anyways.' 'It's very easy to talk.' 'But very difficult to act.' 'We'll see when you actually do something different in life.'

I've come here for the interview. See madam, this queue is not for Miss India! This line is for a driver's job! I've come here for the driver's job interview. Why are you joking so early in the morning! Here's my CV. Please give it to Mr Kapoor. CV? - She has brought CV. Are you serious? All right then. Please wait here. I'll be right back! Please be in the queue. This is not a cinema show going on! I have 26 years of driving 'inexperience''! From a bullock cart to a Bentley, I've driven it all! And till date I've been involved in only two and a half 'askidents'! Two and a half!? - Twice there was a collision with other cars. And once, I rammed into a pole... Now since there was no second party involved.. ..we can't call it a full 'askident'! It'll be counted as half only, right! But the car wasn't much damaged, and as for the loss of life, I'm standing intact in front of you! Ha ha ha! You've got lovely 'inexperience'! We'll let you know in a day or two. - Yes. Sir tomorrow's Friday. It's my fasting day when I abstain from all speech. It'll be best if you let me know on Saturday. I'm absolutely active on Saturday. Perfect! We'll call you on Saturday then. Mention not, Sir! What sort of morons are coming since morning! I'd thought that, after reading this sensational ad,.. ..there will be a jamboree of MBAs lined up outside. But leave aside MBAs or graduates... ...not even a single high-school pass out has showed up till now! Where will we find a driver for this Undertaker? You know how finicky my grandson is! Sir, Tanya madam has come. Gosh, now these credit card people have started.. ..showing up at home too! No no. She's come for the driver's job interview. What!? All right. Send her inside. - Yes sir. Please come with me. This is not fair! We've been in the queue since morning! Good Morning. I'm Tanya. Good morning. Please have a seat. - Hi. - Hi. Mango was saying that you've come here for the job interview! - Yes. See this interview is not for a white-collar job. It is for a driver's job! As far as I remember.. ..you hadn't advertised for a sales or marketing job! Please excuse us for being so surprised! Actually we hadn't expected a girl to apply for this job! Pardon my saying this sir,.. ..but don't you think that's a little hypocritical! In this day and age when a man can be a make-up artist... ...why can't a woman be a driver? According to me, if women can become astronauts... ...I'm sure they can become drivers too! And, statistically speaking... ...in comparison to male drivers.. ..female drivers are involved in 37.58 percent less accidents! So I've read somewhere. Honestly Tanya, I don't doubt your or other girls' capability. Besides, I've reviewed your CV. It's very impressive! But despite being so qualified, why do you want to do this job!? There are two reasons for that: Firstly, I love SUVs! When I read that I'll get a chance to drive one,.. ..I didn't need further incentive. And secondly, some people think that I can't do this job... ...and I have a point to prove to them! Perfect! Then you are absolutely ideal for this job! But one quick question... ...can you drive! "Let me take you for a ride" "On the other side" "I can show you the whole world" "Baby if you like" "GD drivin' in Bombay" "Every single night and every morning" "Girl dynamite driver" "A knockout of a driver" "India's first female chauffeur" "A truly smashing chauffeur" "Girl dynamite driver" "A knockout of a driver" "India's first female chauffeur" "A truly smashing chauffeur" "Prancing around!" "Prancing around!" "Go girl...Go girl...Go girl!" Very impressive Tanya! Very impressive! - Thank you Sir. Consider this job yours... There are just two small conditions. And what are those? Firstly, you have to address me as Grandpa, not Sir. Okay. - And secondly, very important... ...you will have to sign a contract ... ...that you will not leave this job before six months. Are you okay with that! You're trapped, Tanya! You'd thought that you'd take this job.. ..prove your point for a few days and then move on. But this has backfired! Tanya, I know this is an unusual situation... ...that's why I'll give you an unusual offer. Your salary would be Rs 50,000 per month, plus perks and allowances. And if you complete the stipulated six months... ...then I'll give you six months' salary as bonus. After that, if you wish, you can continue... ...or else you can do whatever you want with that money. You can study further, you can invest... ...whatever you wish to do! I accept. Excellent! I'll send Mango to your place tomorrow. He'll give you the contract and take you to the designer. Get a uniform as per your liking. Okay Grandpa. Thank you. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. It was mentioned in the ad that the driver should be.. ..comfortable with silence!? Actually Arjun his grandson, and my friend.. ..who you basically have to work with... ...likes to meditate in the car... ...he abstains from speech sometimes. Otherwise, he's very chilled out! Okay. - You'll quite enjoy working with him! All the best! - Thank you! God bless you Tanya. Bye. Grandpa, if I knew that.. ..you'd be offering this kind of a pay package and perks... ...then I'd have gladly become Arjun's driver! I know this salary is a little high for this kind of work. But it's not about money Sam! This is the first time I've found someone of Arjun's calibre. My heart tells me that this girl.. ..will bring about a positive change in Arjun's life. He'll become a better human being. And that's exactly what I want! To accomplish that.. ..even if I have to put in a few hundred thousand rupees.. ..it doesn't matter. And what about your bet! Don't you want to win!? A wise person once said: If you get what you desire it's good... ...and if you don't, it's even better! Regardless of whether I win this bet or Arjun.. ..we both stand to benefit! You just wait and watch! So Grandpa, any luck? In what? - In finding a driver for me! Yes, I've found one. Exactly what you were looking for! Tanveer Tokas. Six feet and six pack. BA honours. Drives like a dream. But there's a slight problem. He's got a thick beard. And I think he's a little touchy about his facial hair. Seems he won't cut it. Nothing doing, Grandpa! This will not work. The driver being clean-shaven is also one of the conditions. I completely forgot to mention that to Sam! When is this Tokas guy joining from? Tomorrow morning. Why don't you talk to him yourself? But Grandpa! Tanya madam.. Mango you keep quiet! One, you don't know how to drive, and then you have such a loud mouth! So son, did you meet any interesting babe while you were in New York? I'd gone to New York for a conference! Don't girls attend a conference? God you're so boring! Where's this Tokas chap of yours? Must be on the way! Grandpa, you know I can't tolerate unpunctuality! If this is his attitude the very first day, what will he do later! He comes from far-off Gurgaon. Must have hit traffic. In a few minutes I'm sure... There he is! Sorry, Grandpa. There was a lot of traffic in route. It's all right. We were just relaxing. Oh, I completely forgot to introduce the two of you! Arjun, this is Tanya, our new team member... ...and Tanya, this is Arjun, the apple of my eye. Good Morning. - Morning! Grandpa, could I have a minute with you, please! I think he got a little shy. He's very bashful, you know! Please get the car to the porch.. ..and we'll join you in a couple of minutes. Sure Grandpa. So champion! How did you like Tanveer Tokas!? Grandpa, what's this? You only had said yesterday that the driver should be clean-shaven! I didn't look at her that closely.. ..but I don't think she has facial hair! O c'mon, Grandpa! I'd asked you to find me a driver, not a doll! From which angle does she look like a driver? And what kind of uniform is she wearing!? You'd said that you want a uniformed driver.. ..but you hadn't specified what kind of uniform it should be! I personally think she looks every bit a driver in this uniform! Have you ever heard about anyone's female driver? What's the big deal about it! Out on the roads, every second or third car is driven by a girl. The only difference here is that she's not driving her own car.. ..but yours! Simple! And by the way, statistically speaking... ...female drivers are involved in 37.58 percent less accidents.. ..compared to male drivers! What!? I've read that somewhere. Grandpa, I think she's too delicate for this job! Please find me another driver! All right, I'll say no to her. First you accept that you have lost the bet! - What!? You'd asked me to find you a driver of my choice... ...and promised that you'll keep that driver for 6 months! My choice is very obviously this girl! Now you decide what you want to do. Grandpa, this is blackmail! All over the world, countless people lose a bet every day. Your name will also be included in that.. ...what's the big deal in that? You don't worry.. ..I'll just go and politely send her back. Wait, Grandpa! If she's your final choice.. ..then I'll keep her as my driver for six months. But our bet was that I will not fire the driver. But if the driver wants to leave of her own accord.. ..then I am not responsible! By all means, try your luck my boy! Go and try! Turn the car around. I like to sit on the other side. Okay. - "Let's go driver." But I think today I'm going to sit on the other side. Okay. All the best, Krishanji! - Krishanji!? In Mahabharat, Krishanji was Arjun's driver, his vanguard, you know! Haven't you seen the TV serial? Let's go! "Let's go driver." "Let me take you on a ride on the other side. - Let's go driver." "Let me show you the whole world if you like." "Let's go driver!" Switch off the music. Should I lower the volume? No, just switch off the music. I don't like noise in the car! And I like the AC temperature at 18.5. Please keep it constant at that. Neither less nor more! I like my car to be driven at a particular speed. On the expressway, I like 65, close to my house 55... ...near the office 45, and close to the construction site 35... ...on Delhi roads 25, and in busy areas only 5. These figures are very important to me. They help me focus! It'll be really nice if you memorise them.. ..and drive the car accordingly. And yes, if there's any confusion.. ..please take a printout from my secretary Rosy for reference. Umm, your office.. When I'm reading the paper, I want total silence! Absolutely no noise. Oh no, you've missed the turn! Nobody gave you the directions? Should I focus on the market news or on the road? I was just about to ask you.. ..but you said you like pin-drop silence in the car. Now take the next exit, then left from the second red light.. ..U-turn under the flyover... ...then third cut right, after 500 metres, the first left... ...then make a right at the T-point and 850 metres after that.. ..the glass building on your left... ...that's our office! And if you have any confusion.. ..take a printout from Rosy for reference. Hmmm, I forgot your name. Tanya. Give me your number, in case I need to contact you. 989174326 I'm giving you a call. Save my number. I'm in office today till 6.05. In case I need something, I'll let you know. Terminator is here!!! What are you doing? Get to work, Immediately! Get to work, I say! Get to work, immediately! Rosy, get me the IT Park file, quick! Morning Sir! Has the furniture consignment arrived from Milan? Yes Sir. What about the serviced apartments project? Sir, the blueprints are ready. And the MCD case? Sir, Mr. Prem Singh has a meeting with the lawyer tomorrow. And how's your mother now? Sir, she's much better now. I hope there was no neglect in her treatment? Sir everything was way beyond our expectations! I really don't know how to thank you, Sir! Great. Let's get back to work then. Sure Sir. Rosy. - Yes Sir. I think I've left the golf course file in my car. Please send Lalchand to get it. Sure Sir. Excuse me. - What's up, Ramesh. It's the same number! Who are you? Who are you!? I'm Lalchand, the field manager of this office. And you'd be? Tanya. I drive this car. That means Terminator has ousted Ramesh too! Terminator!? Your back-seat neighbour... What a contrast his grandfather and he are! The former hasn't changed a driver in decades... ...while firing drivers seems to be this one's hobby! We've lost count but he still hasn't tired of throwing them out! What do you mean!? In 3 years, he'd have fired at least 4 dozen drivers. Once a driver drove a little fast over a speed-breaker. That's it. Terminator told him right there.. ..to park the car aside, give him the keys and leave! He fires people at the slightest pretext. Though I don't think he'll do that to you. At least not in the middle of the road! You're a girl, that's why! Okay, Tanya ji, I reckon we'll be meeting every day... ...at least for the next few days. All the best! Terminator's old driver out! Terminator's new driver in... ...and she is sitting in the car! You mean, a girl? Yes! A girl! You're surely bluffing! She's not a driver, she's a beauty queen, I'm telling you! If you don't believe me, go have a look yourself! Do your work. I think the AC is cooling a bit too much today! It's putting a lot of pressure on my bladder. I'll just come. Haven't taken a cigarette break for long! You carry on, workaholics. I'll be back. Thank God someone's sitting in the car! I thought the window has been accidentally left open! These days you never know, someone might just steal the music system. By the way, I'm Jolly. Jolly Bhatnagar. Manager, sales department. It's really nice to meet you. Come upstairs sometime. We'll have coffee... ...with cream biscuits. All right then, I'll take your leave. Take care of yourself! Have a good day! Ramesh, give me a match.. Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't know that boss has dismissed Ramesh. But looking at you, I can say it was the right decision... ...rather what a beautiful decision! I'm sorry, what's wrong with me! I'm Ramakant. Ramakant Dubey, manager, sales department. Come upstairs sometime. We'll have coffee together... Ya stuff like that. Anyways, we'll be meeting each other often. I'll see you when I see you! Creep! Hi conman. Hey dude, wassup! So how was the surprise? This plan of yours and Grandpa's to make me lose the bet.. .. is not going to work. Good try though! You baffle me! I expected you to say thank you, but you're being so ungrateful! Do you know if everybody in India had a driver like her... ...how much the entire country will benefit! At least people will stop peeping into others' cars! Very funny! It's not funny, it's a fact! Okay, jokes apart, tell me honestly, what do you think of her? I don't have time for such frivolity. Frivolity! She's a dynamo in looks and temperament both. Just see, how this driver will change the direction of your life! Time alone will tell who changes whose direction. Any ways stop sermonising now. I'll call you later. So Krishanji, tomorrow please come to the battle ground on time. This Arjun doesn't like to wait. I'm sorry if I caused you inconvenience in the morning. But honestly, even I have no intention of making anyone wait! "Go girl...Go girl...Go girl!" So Tanya... How was it with Terminator? Sorry!? That's what the office staff call him, right? Tanya, Arjun was seven when his mother passed away. My son Sunil settled in London and he remarried. Arjun has always lived with me, without his parents. He has a very kind heart Tanya, but is just a little actually very stubborn! But it gives me great pleasure to see someone.. ..even more stubborn than him! Well done Tanya. Keep it up and God bless you. Thank you Grandpa. Hey Khullar! Bhatia, what's up? Mr. Kapoor, you're quite a trendsetter! Arjun's driver is an absolute knockout! - Yes. Have some shame guys! She's of your granddaughter's age! She's of my granddaughter's age, but not my granddaughter, right! Mr. Kapoor, half my life has been spent in the car! From the house to the factory, from factory to the showroom and back. If I'd thought of this unique idea earlier... ...at least half my life would have been pleasant! Come shameless creatures, let's go for a walk. Your brain will get some oxygen and purify your thoughts. - Okay. Okay. - Lets go. An urgent meeting has come up in the office. I have to leave early. Be there at 7.30 in the morning. Let's go! So Miss Hotshot Chauffeur! Tell me about your day. Don't ask! For the first time in my life I've seen a man like this! Really! What's he like? Insufferable! I mean how's he to look at? Is he like one of those heroes from Mills & Boon.. ..tall, good-looking, rich, spoilt? I don't know about the other qualities, but he's spoilt for sure... ...and very rude! Really! I was expecting something else altogether! I thought he'll ask you every few minutes.. ..whether you're comfortable or not... ...if the AC temperature is okay for you... ...what music would you like to hear... I thought he was going to be really chivalrous! Chivalrous! I doubt if he even knows the spelling of chivalry! As for the AC temperature, he didn't ask, he informed! I like the AC temperature at a constant 18.5. Neither less nor more! God I was freezing! He even has to monitor what speed the car will be driven at! As for the music, he's very clear... ...he says he doesn't like noise in the car! Wow, he sounds like Hitler! His office people have given him a perfect name: Terminator! He fires more than he hires! God, Tanny how will you cope with him? I don't know Pooja. Spending six minutes with him is so torturous... How I'm going to last six months, I don't know! "Let's go driver!" "Let's go driver!" "Go girl!" "Let's go driver!" "Girl dynamite driver." "Let's go driver!" "Prancing around!" "Dancing around!" Today we'll go to the office not in this one, but in Bentley! "Let's go driver!" There's no Bentley over there! Damn! I live in the future so much! I completely forgot that I'd ordered the Bentley just last week! It'll be delivered after two months. All right then, get the Audi back. Let's go in that one only! Scumbag! "Let's go driver." Music! You had an early morning meeting, right! It got cancelled. I don't know why he's such a jerk! You said something? No! I don't know why she's so arrogant! You said something? No! God, please give me one chance to teach him a lesson. Please, I beg of you! Hi Tanya! Oh hi!? Meet my fiance Priyanka. Hi Tanya. - Hi. You know, Tanya, ever since I have heard about you.. ..I've been so fascinated! Today girls are excelling in every field.. ..but what you are doing is truly commendable. That too after being so well-educated! I truly admire your guts! Thanks Priyanka.. ..but I honestly think that whatever I'm doing is very normal! After all, I'm just driving a car, not a fighter plane! What are you saying, Tanya! Driving a car in India is no less than driving a fighter plane! Have you seen how people drive! And especially, seeing a girl at the wheel.. ..brings out their animal instincts. They will overtake, even if they don't have to! And, Oh God, have you seen how men stare inside the car? Men will never understand this predicament! I had understood it the very first day, .. ..but who can explain it to Arjun! Don't even get me started on him! For him everything in life is a bet! As in!? Left to him, he'd make even breathing into a bet. You're aware right that your job is thanks to a bet too! Yes, he'd entered into a bet with Grandpa... ...that he'll retain his next driver his 46th in 3 years.. .. for six months. And he's fulfilling that obligation for the past 2 weeks. Otherwise, looking at his track record, by now, you'd have.. Oh! That's why Grandpa had made me sign the contract for six months!! Just like it's essential for the sun to rise every morning... ...it's equally important for Arjun to win every bet. In fact if I need to get anything done from him.. ..I simply enter into a bet with him. His ego gets satisfied and I too get my work done! 'Interesting'! Great! We'll go wish the big boss! - Yes. Yes. See you later. All right Tanya, it was lovely meeting you. I'll see you around, okay, bye-bye! - Bye. Hmm Arjun smarty-pants! You've caused me so much distress! It's payback time now. "Go girl...Go girl...Go girl!" Nice book. Have you read it? I've read all of Wayne Dyer's books. Hmm! He writes very well... Just that I'm not very convinced by one theory of his! Which theory? He says that if a man so decides.. ..he can do whatever he wants, big or small. I don't quite agree with that. - "Go girl.." Why? I feel every person is cut out for a particular work... ...and every work is cut out for a particular person. Nobody can do everything... I think that's impossible. Why is it impossible? Take Bill Gates for example. His capability lies in the IT field. That's why he excels in that. But if he tried to become a plumber, I don't think he'll be able to! Wrong! I don't agree! I think if Bill Gates is determined enough, he can become anything... ...doctor, musician, teacher... ...even a plumber! I don't think so! Any ways, let's consider another example... Driving! - "Go girl.." According to me, not everyone can be a driver! It needs a special skill, a special temperament... ...which not everyone has! - "Go girl.." What's the big deal in that! I simply believe that once you have a rock-solid willpower.. ..nothing is impossible. Take my example: If I want, I can do anything! Anything at all! In fact, if I want, I can become a top-class driver too! I don't know! I'm doing it because I have different capabilities! But it's not everyone's cup of tea! I can prove you wrong! - "Go girl.." Please don't take it personally. I was just.. No, no, let's see how much confidence you have in your theory! I stick by what I just said. All right then. Now I'll show you! I'll become a driver and disprove your theory! - "Go girl.." Do you want to bet! - "Let's go driver." I don't know what to say! How about this weekend? Actually my aunt and uncle are coming from Chandigarh. I was thinking of showing them around Delhi! Perfect! Don't reveal my identity to them. Just pretend that I'm your driver, employed by the company.. ..in which you work. Two days I'll drive them around Delhi, and also prove to you that... ...if I want, nothing is impossible for me! All right, if you so insist! But what would the bet be? You really enjoy listening to music in the car, don't you! - Yes. If you win, you can play as much music in the car as you want... ...and if I win, which I obviously will... ...then you'll have to even forget.. ..where the music system buttons are! I accept. Bet!? Bet. "Let's go, driver." "Let's go, driver." So that's Arjun, your boss-cum-driver! So, Miss Fake Marketing Manager, what's the plan? Today, we shall do Delhi sightseeing. And tomorrow's for shopping. I think two days are enough to teach Terminator a lesson. - "Go girl." That too, two days with him and Pappu Uncle together in the same car! They'll get along like a house on fire! By the way, where is Pappu Uncle? Yes, go for it Zaheer! Just two more wickets needed! Yes, c'mon, c'mon! Uncle the driver's here. So what! Drivers are supposed to wait. It's their job! Look at this man! It's been 26 years to our marriage! He hasn't taken me out anywhere! And today, when we've got such a golden opportunity... ...this stupid match is throwing a spanner in the works! As if their uncles were playing! Look I'm warning you not to insult me any further! I'll count till three. Switch off the TV yourself.. ..or I will switch it off. One... She is too much. Two... Here Mrs Sweety! See I've switched it off. No tension. Happy! Now please be done with your spiel as well! 26 years have somehow lapsed. But the 2 days that we are in Delhi, let me be at peace at least! Let's move then. Tanya, my child, you do get FM radio in your car, right!? Yes uncle, you'll love the match commentary in the car even more! Come. "Let's go, driver." Hello! Keep the bag in the boot! Why are you standing transfixed, like a Madame Tussauds' statue? Tanya, you should have told me that the driver is such a young chap! Would have preened myself up a bit. What's your name? Arjun. Do you deem it improper to clean the car? See it's gathered so much dust! Driving doesn't simply mean working the wheel!! Thinking himself to be a great driver. All the best! "Go girl." Let's go, driver! "Let's go, driver." Let's see what state the match is in! 'Three balls left and four runs required.' 'And only one wicket left.' India.. How dare you! Do you have no manners at all! You dare not turn it off this time! Uncle I normally don't like to listen.. .. to music in the car, that's why! But if you really want to, it's fine... 'And that's an excellent victory.' 'And this match India has..' - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! India has won the match, dude! Hey listen, I can understand.. ..that you have absolutely no sense of propriety... ...but at least you can compensate in your driving! Is this how one drives? Nonsense! Relax champ! Till now you've never lost a bet! You have to win this one too, no matter what! "Let's go, driver." Today's weather is cool, isn't it? - Yes. Definitely you will enjoy. Oh, Sir's phone is ringing! Yes Rosy. See, I've spoken to Mishra ji! How can you allow him to use the phone while driving! ..and I'll do paper work. He's going to get us a ticket for sure! I'll talk to you later. So what if you've learnt two words of English... ...and are wearing a dry-cleaned uniform! Next time you feel like talking to this Rosy or Lotus of yours.. ..do it off-duty, not while driving. I'm sure your salary won't be as much as the ticket we'd have got! Don't give me that look now, okay! We've come to Delhi to enjoy, not to be martyred! Please switch off the AC. But Aunty, the temperature is alright! And we that have been reduced to frozen chicken on the back seat! It's scaldingly hot outside! But not inside! Is the AC running inside or outside? If madam is telling you to switch off the AC,.. .. then simply switch it off! Thank you buddy! My name is not buddy! Look, Karan.. - Arjun. Do you have to argue every time! What's in a name, any ways! I'm in such good mood right now. India has won the match. Be quiet for some time, and let peace prevail. Where are we headed, Tanya? Tanya!? He addresses you as Tanya? Do you have no shame? You call madam by her name!? Is this what your parents have taught you? Sorry ma'am! Where do we have to go? Qutub Minar. Right, ma'am! Now don't start asking, why do we have go... ...is it important, cant' we go tomorrow! "This is called.." "This is called tit for tat" "This is called.." "This is called tit for tat" "This is called tit for tat" "The boy will not forget this lesson" "This is called tit for tat" "The boy will not forget this lesson" "He is duly chastised" "His ego has got a crackling blow" "This is called.." "This is called tit for tat" "This is called.." "This is called tit for tat" "He thought it's going to be a cakewalk" "But it's turning out to be an ordeal" "Now he's going through a turmoil" "Boy, he's going bonkers" "He thought it's going to be a cakewalk" "But it's turning out to be an ordeal" "Now he's going through a turmoil" "Boy, he's going bonkers" "Boy, he's going bonkers" "This is called tit for tat" "This is called tit for tat" "Pappu is quite a dynamo" "He paid no heed to any of his pleas" "Now he has no desires left" "He is learning it the hard way" "Pappu is quite a dynamo" "He paid no heed to any of his pleas" "Now he has no desires left" "He is learning it the hard way" "This is called tit for tat" "This is called tit for tat" "This is called tit for tat" "The boy will not forget this lesson" "He is duly chastised" "His ego has got a crackling blow" "This is called tit for tat" "This is called tit for tat" "Tit for tat" Drivers are supposed to step out and open the door for you! He's good for nothing. What happened, Wax Museum? We've got a flat tyre. Why do you need to broadcast it? Just go and change the tyre! Not possible! What do you mean by that? Are we supposed to carry this car over our head? I don't know how to change a flat tyre. Just our luck! Driving you don't know... ...manners you don't have, clean it you can't... ...and now to top it, you can't even change a tyre! I'm sure you must have bribed someone to get this job! What'll we do now? Don't worry Aunty. I'll have a look. See, learn something from her! Left to you, I'm sure Tanya would be at the wheel... ...and you'd be lounging on the back seat, coolly reading a paper! That's how it usually goes. What!? Nothing! I meant that every day the car drives smoothly. Never had a flat tyre before! Today is the first time. Tanya, child, you step aside now. Let me help you. Please help her. - It's okay Uncle. It's almost done. She's saying it's almost done! Look at him! What a lazy lout he is! His employer is changing the tyre while .. .. he's the picture of indifference! Utterly shameless, I tell you! At least you should lend her a hand! He has lethargy written all over his face! Don't ask sisters! These days you just don't get good servants, you see! I must say, this world has become topsy-turvy. The owner works and the driver rests. "Let's go, driver." Thank God, you do something at least! Now will you reach us home or should we take a cab from here? A bus would take you there too! What!? Nothing! Let's go! Now what happened, Slow Motion! We'll have to look for a gas station! Thank God! We've finally reached! "Let's go, driver." I don't know how Tanya tolerates him! If he were my driver, I'd have thrown him out in 5 minutes! Be quiet. He might hear it! As if I care! Listen you: focus on work! And yes, if possible, do try to smile sometime. I've heard it's a good exercise to burn calories! Okay! Good night then, Karan. Good night! I have mended dozens like him. I'm sorry! Uncle was too rude today. It's okay. Some people are like that: complicated! They don't really care about others. I don't like you being insulted like that! If you wish, we can call off the bet! Nope. A bet is a bet is a bet. There's no question of calling it off! I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, and yes, drop the bag upstairs, fast! Come, child, he'll get it. Hi sexy! - Hi. So, how was Arjun's court martial? It was hilarious! It seemed like one Arjun is talking to another! Tell me, how did he manage to control himself? Don't ask! The way Uncle was ragging him, I thought he'll explode any moment! But he was pretty well-mannered! Really!? - Ya. I guess, he doesn't mind Pappu Uncle, after all! But for the bet, I'd worked that Pappu guy into a pulp! He was telling me: Oye Karan, clean the car nicely... ...drive properly; concentrate on the road... ...don't you have manners; switch off the AC; turn on the commentary! Am I a human being or a robot! Will see you, Chandigarh Express! Till now I used to think that you're the only one of your kind. But this Pappu Uncle seems to be your xerox copy! And he's picked out the same points as you! Shut up Sam! There is a world of difference between us! Ya, the difference is .. .. that he said all these points to a single driver... ...while you used to say it to different ones at different times. Enough of your moral science lecture! Already my head's spinning! Are we having dinner or should I go home? Why, didn't you have dinner with your Pappu Uncle! Okay, come on. Come, let's go! Tell me, is my car okay! I hope you didn't vent out Pappu Uncle's anger on it! O Sweety I want your love. O Sweety I want your love. Not once but a thousand times over. O Sweety I want your love. Not once but a thousand times over. Sweety, Sweety, Sweety, O my love Sweety! She blushes, I tell you! Stop it now! It's okay! We're all family here...except one! Look, the cop's here. Roll down the window. Do you have to douse a fire somewhere? Driving at 80! Show me your licence. Tanya. - Show the car papers. - Yes, Uncle. I think this driver is a thief! Why Uncle? Just look at his wallet! It has so many credit cards. I think he's stolen them! - Show me. No Uncle! Actually, our company has given him! You know, to fill up gas in the car. So many credit cards! To buy gas or to buy a gas station! The road is not a racetrack. If not for you, somebody must be waiting at home for others at least. I'm letting you go this time .. ..because of these ladies, but don't repeat it! Thank you sir! Control room. Didn't realise at all when the speed went up! Check if the car is driving of its own accord!? Hurry up. Come on. The chocolates are looking so tempting! Seeing a chocolate shop is enough to make her drool. Oh no! Arjun sir! O hello, Mr. Sahni! How are you? - How are you? - I'm absolutely fine. What a pleasant surprise! I'd come for a lunch meeting at the restaurant. And you!? Actually my Aunty-Uncle are here from Chandigarh. I thought I should do something special for them. - Good! That's why I'm posing as a driver for.. ..a day and taking them around Delhi. That's a nice gesture. Now, my philosophy is that whatever one does.. ..one should do it with complete earnestness. That's why I'm donning this uniform! Looking so nice! That was so nice, isn't it? - Yes. That one too. - Even I have it in Chandigarh. You know, but I'm having a great time. - I'm sure. You guys should try it too! - Hey driver! I told them emphatically to think of me as their driver.. ..and address me as one too. It should look authentic, you know! - Yes. All right. You have a great day. I'll see you later, then gentlemen. Yeah. Sure. Bye. - Have a nice time. Who were they? And what was that round-table conference all about! My ex-boss! He said that I should join back and that they'll double my salary! I told them I'll think about it. What nonsense! I have seen these tactics before. Stay put where you are, alright! Enough now! Arjun, can you get us tickets for the new Rajkumar Hirani movie? In Chandigarh, he has no time for me. But today I'm resolved to see this movie at any cost! But I've already seen that one! Hello. You are a classic pile-on. Self-inviting yourself! Now go, get three tickets of Gold Class, last row centre seats. Take this. You'll get only one ticket in this much money! We don't have to buy gold, only watch a movie in Gold Class! And you're saying as if you keep sitting there every day! I'll take it on my credit card. See the real use of the credit card! It's okay uncle. Let me treat you to this one. I'll get the tickets. - Why should you go? What is this James Bond for! Okay. Okay!? No, it's not okay. You're hurt! I don't want to break your heart. If it makes you happy, you only give the money. Give me my note back. I don't want to hurt her. And yes, remember to return the balance to madam. Don't pocket it, thinking it to be office account. Can't break the child's heart, right! Here, take it! Give me three tickets for Munnabhai Returns,.. ..the 2 o'clock show please. Oh, and by the way, first row, centre seats, Gold Class please! James Bond is here. Give it to me. Take your balance Tanya. Listen up, we'll be free in about three hours or so. You keep these bags in the car and wait there for us. Even today you want me to wait in the car! So wait outside the car then! Hurry up, the movie's about to start. Left to this man, we'd miss half the film! Come on, let's go. But where are you? I am waiting in mall. Where are you? Hey monster mind! How is Arjun's court martial at the hands of Pappu Uncle? I hope you're having fun! Oh, so you're trying to con Arjun! No worries. The movie's just begun, my friend! "Let's go, driver." This hero resembles Arjun so much! What a waste of money! You should have seen Arjun live instead! He's utterly useless! I'd asked him to get the last row seats and he got the first row! Now stop gaping at the hero, and concentrate on the film! What a movie it was! - Really. It was fun. Meaningful as well as entertaining. Holy cow! - What? So you guys are finally here. We'd asked him to wait in the car for three hours.. ..not three hundred years! What has become of him! - Come.. come.. come. Actually Arjun suddenly fell ill. Somebody seems to have tortured him mercilessly. So the company management sent me to take care of you. By the looks of it, we'll have to take care of you, Uncle, isn't it? You seem to very naughty! Nonetheless, my name is Salim Uncle. And what would be your introduction? I don't praise myself. My name is Pappu...and this is my.. What a flawlessly lustrous beauty! Seems to be your daughter. Wonderful! Hasn't taken after her father one bit! And this must be your granddaughter! Truly it's a pleasure to have met your family. Also it makes me observe.. ..that everyone in your family is very beautiful.. ..except you, Pupu. My name is Pappu! What's in a name! Karan or Arjun, they're both the same, right? Why doesn't it make a difference? If I call you Salma instead of Salim, would you like it? Salma Uncle? Pupu, why are you shouting at me like that! God have mercy. I am feeling uneasy. Somebody give me water, please! - Yes. I knew that we'll only have to take care of him! I'm fainting! Give it to me. Here. Here gulp this. - What are you doing? You want to take my life or what! I only drink mineral water. I'll get it for you. You stay here with me, girl. Pupu will go get it. Are you out of your mind? Go quickly. Don't be so cruel now. Quickly go get some water for him. Go quickly! Go quickly! And get some water for me. O wow! It seems like Granduncle is being taken care of very well. Take your hand off her. Here, have this. O no! You've got me the wrong brand! I don't have this one. Listen up, old man, this is water, not whiskey.. ..that you drink it keeping the brand in mind. Have it or else I'm throwing it away. You've started shouting at me again! Go get all the other brands. - Go get all the other brands. Quickly go. - Don't waste any more time, Pupu. Here, I've got all the other brands. Have whichever one like, before the Final Call comes. This is not needed now. I'm feeling fine just like that. Oh so your lease seems to have been extended by a few more months! Now should we go home Uncle .. .. or you wish to reduce my weight any further. Ya sure, why not! Keep telling me every now and then if there's any car ahead of.. ..beside or behind us. The thing is that my vision gets blurred after 5.15 in the evening. Okay.. okay. - But don't be alarmed. You'll definitely reach us to our heavenly abode, uncle. Give me the keys. I'll drive the car. You come and sit on the front seat next to me. Not at all, mister. The thing is that if someone else is driving.. ..I prefer to sit on the back seat. Otherwise, it gives me palpitations. Oh gosh! Where does your company find such morons from? Sweety, you come and sit on the front seat with me. I hope you sit on the back seat with me, fair one! It'll give me some support. Old Uncle, she's my wife, not your company's freight goods! Quickly sit in the car, before this Mughal emperor.. ..Bahadur Shah Zafar, does your full inspection! You too sit in the car now. - Come girl, let's go. Come Pupu, come. The name's Pappu. You know how to drive, right, Pupu? What difference does it make Uncle! Had you driven, we'd have gone heavenwards too! I've been itching to say something. Should I? Sure Uncle. At this age, anyway, you should not keep any dream unfulfilled. Who knows if tomorrow comes or not. Let's go, driver! Let's go! We've got the old man up till here, but how will he go home? Don't worry about me, son Pupu. This ailment affects only from 5.15 To 6.45. Post that I become perfect, and even my eyesight becomes 66. Why don't you pick up these bags? He just said that he becomes all right after 7.15! Spare a thought about his age. Oh, so now you've started coughing! Here, give me the bags. Okay Pupu, and Pupu's dear family... ...if God so wills we shall meet again. I hope that situation never arises! You said something, Pupu? Uncle, I was just saying that you should take off your glasses now. Who's going to admire your modelling this late at night! These are my night-vision goggles. They help me see road and people clearly. Okay, Tanaaya, I will see you tomorrow. I'm really worried about Arjun. Don't quite know what state he'd be in. Okay let's go. If you're so worried, then let's take him with us to Chandigarh. We'll make him our scooter's driver. No music in the car from today. I'll be a good girl! Turn on the music please. But.. Now that you've decided, I'll also have to be a good guy right! Have a nice day! You too! It's become really hot. I don't think it'll be very comfortable to sit in the car. No, no, I'll be fine. Thanks. There's a lounge inside. It's mostly empty. Come with me. I insist. Okay. In case you need anything tell Lalchand or... ..let me know! Sure! Yeah! - Thanks. Tell me, what's your favourite book? The Secret. Now that's uncanny! It's my favourite book too! Really? - Absolutely. So you must be believing in the book's principles too! I mean, The Law of Attraction! Completely! I am of the firm belief that what we desire.. ..with all our being truly comes to be... What's this? Miami's best hotel. Today is 21st September. Exactly six months have passed. See, I defeated you! It's a special high losing to you, son. I pray that you win every battle in life. Should we go this Sunday? We have multiple-entry visa anyway. You're no less than the sprinter PT Usha. Let's go at leisure next month. Anyway I have to go out of town tomorrow for a couple of days. Why!? - It's my friend, Gupta's son's wedding. But I'll be back in two days. Till then, you get tickets done. And do one thing: make a plan for the 10th or 12th of next month. Have a look at the hotel at least! We'll go wherever you like, my boy. Even a strip club! Definitely! Will you take a lap dance? - Why not! Grandpa you're too mischievous! After all, whose grandfather am I! Hi! - Hi! Big day, right! You know what's the occasion today? Sameer had told me about the bet. That bet was just a joke, you know! It's totally cool! In fact, even I'd signed a contract that.. ..I won't leave this job for six months. Contract!? When did that happen!? Wow! I used to think that I'm the only mastermind. But others are no less. So, in fact, I should thank you... ...for not leaving this job! Actually I did it for a personal reason. I needed money, and Grandpa gave me such a good offer that.. ..I simply couldn't refuse. So, what's your plan now? I'll go to Chandigarh and open an adventure travel agency.. ..in my parents' name. I've waited really long for this day! So you've decided that you'll not come to work from tomorrow? Please don't mind but I did this all for a goal. And now that's been fulfilled. So I guess it's time for me to move on now! Hey listen, I think then .. .. this is an important occasion for both of us. Why don't we celebrate it! Even I feel as if examinations are over! Tanya, tell me, do you like history? Ya. You know there's a historic fort called Neemrana .. ..a few hours from Delhi. Have you been there? - No. Since you've never been there... ...and more importantly, because you like history as well... ...why don't we go there? Okay! Should we go this evening? Like this!? I'm so sorry! Leave office early today. You can go home and change. Okay. After that, what time should I pick you up? Actually, today I'll pick you up. Say around 4 o'clock? Okay. Sounds good? Hi. - Hi. Wow Tanya! You're looking nice! Do I need to say the same about you? Shall we? Itching to say one thing. Should I? Don't say: "Let's go, driver." You drive well. Tanya, we can be more informal... "A brand new moment" "Everything is changing in it" "A beautiful milieu" "A caravan of hope" "Everything seems so wonderful" "Joy is here and now" "A sweet, tender feeling" "As if someone dear is close by" "A brand new moment" "Everything is changing in it" "A beautiful milieu" "A caravan of hope" "The sky seems to be travelling" "A spell is cast upon us" "The sky seems to be travelling" "A spell is cast upon us" "The earth is spinning" "We're loving the present moment" "The earth is spinning" "We're loving the present moment" "A brand new moment" "Everything is changing in it" "A beautiful milieu" "A caravan of hope" I think this car will miss you, Tanya! I will miss it too! Tanya, tell me something... If you get more money, will you still do this job? Grandpa has sent the bonus cheque home. I've gathered the amount of money I needed as start-up capital. So, I guess, money is not an incentive anymore. Tanya I just.. Oh.. sorry.. Pick it up. Hello. Jasmeet!! Hey sweetie! Where are you? Upstairs!! Are you serious? I will come in two minutes. You just wait there! Bye. That was Jasmeet, my best friend, my soulmate. When I was studying in college in Chandigarh, that's where we met. We had so much in common... ...infact we still do! We do everything together. Chilling together, going to the movies. God, Jasmeet is so much fun! In fact, Jasmeet's facebook profile picture.. ..has a crazy photograph of the two of us. We almost look like a married couple! Jasmeet is like my soulmate!! Tanya, there's some really important work. I have to leave. - But you should come upstairs. It'll be so much fun! You can meet Jasmeet - I know, but I really have to go. Are you sure!? - Yeah. Well...keep in touch! I'll try. Okay. Take care. Bye. "Coincidence" "Or a tale" "A puzzle" "Or a surprise" "What is life!" "Coincidence" "Or a tale" "A puzzle" "Or a surprise" "What is life!" "Or a surprise" "What is life!" "One thought of something" "And something else occurred" "Why did this happen" "Why did that happen" "Why did this happen" "Why did that happen" "One doesn't know" "Doesn't really know." "Coincidence" "Or a tale" "So lonely" "Why so lonely" "Life" "A surprise indeed life is." "A surprise indeed life is." There's only one remorse. Not even once did we have coffee together. At least she should have given us her phone number. No worries, we'll find her on Facebook. Yeah, tell me. - What dude! You are back to square one, after six months! What do you mean? Today morning Tanya came to the store. She said she would be leaving for Chandigarh today. She was almost in tears. Did you say something to her? Why would I say anything to her? And why did she come to your store? She wanted to introduce me to her friend Jasmeet.. ..who is an interior designer. Tanya thought I might be able to help Jasmeet. Really! So how did you like her boyfriend, Jasmeet!? Hey don't bend the gender, man! It's her girlfriend, Jasmeet. What!? Yes, Jasmeet Kaur! O no! What happened? Dude I've got to go! I'll call you later. Hi Pooja, this is Arjun. Could you do me a favour? Hello! Snazzy suit! Whose is it? Uncle.. Since when did I become your uncle? Call me Sir. Sir, the thing is that.. And yes, I should clarify one more thing... ...if you've come here thinking that I will appoint you my driver... ...then that's your delusion, Karan! Arjun. - O God, this Karan-Arjun! See that's why! You get incensed at the slightest pretext. And how fragile are you!? One day you took us out for sightseeing in Delhi.. ..and landed up in hospital the next day! And on top of that, stuck that Granduncle onto us! O hi! What a surprise! You're looking dashing! Thank you! - You're looking nice too. Thank you. - Enough of these thank yous! Say what you're here to say and then be on your way! Is Tanya there? Tanya.. did you see? No, she's gone to scale Mount Everest! I've told him so often to be more respectful to his elders.. ..and to his superiors! Why don't you go inside! The match is at such a critical juncture. Go have a look at the score! Her travel agency hasn't yet started and the peon is already here! Go now! I'll just call her. Thank you. Hi! Hi. You know, I had a friend in school named Ramanpreet. Anyone who'd call him for the first time would always say: May I speak with Miss Ramanpreet, please! Some names are a bit confusing, you know! Such a trivial thing! Don't you think you should have clarified!? Tanya, till a few days ago.. ..I used to think that people are mere tools to help me reach my goal. I had made myself into a machine. But today, I realized for the first time that I'm not a machine. I have a heart too, which has feelings.. ..very special feelings, ..for a very special girl... A girl with whom I can find meaning in my life.. ..rather I can share my entire life with. And Tanya, after you left, I realised that that girl is you! I really don't know what to say! Tanya, so far, you've driven my car. Would you like to drive my life from now on? Yes! But first I want to start my travel agency. And that too with my own money. Absolutely. And I will decide the car's speed! Completely! And the AC temperature as well! 18.5 won't do!? Absolutely not! Done! Tanya, what are you doing!? Hope you haven't given a job to this pile-on! Uncle, meet Mr. Arjun Kapoor, my ex-boss. We'll definitely meet your boss! But why have you made him wait outside? Call him inside! He.. Boss!!? I've got to go! I call you later. Oh no! Tanya, you're so heartless! Should have at least informed us he's your boss. Poor thing, he had to face so much inconvenience because of us! But Aunty, you've always treated him very well! I'm so embarrassed now! Even I am also... ...a little bit embarrassed! Mr. Kapoor, oops Arjun ji! I'd like to compliment you... ...not on this card but on that authentic getup of yours! Fantastic! I don't want to disappoint you, but I must tell you one thing... ...I'd recognised you on the first day itself! Believe me, guys! After all, it's a matter of plain common sense! Only a tycoon can have so many credit cards! I'd even told Sweety! I'd told you, right! What!? - What! Perpetually stuck on your "whats" and "ifs"! She is very forgetful! Anyways, Arjun ji... Sir, I mean...I really want to say one thing. With your permission, that is! Uncle, it's your rightful due! Let's go, driver! "Let's go, driver!" "Let me take you for a ride on the other side."
