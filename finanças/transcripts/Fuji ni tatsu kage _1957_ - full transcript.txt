In Europe Napoleon rules over vast territories. In Japan, Ienari rules as the 11th Tokugawa Shogun. An incident, which became an open official secret, took place in the foothills of Mt. Fuji. Fearing attacks from within and without, the Shogunate planned to build a new training castle utilizing the most advanced techniques. Two master castle architects, Sato Kikutaro and Kumai Hakuten, were selected to compete for the honor of designing and building the castle. "The winner of the competition between "Sato Kikutaro from Edo and Kumaki Hakuten from Odawara "will be the builder of the Shogunate's Fuji castle." "All are ordered to cooperate with "their land survey and preparations." "September 2, 1805. Lord Mizuno Dewa." What are you doing? Please stop. You are ruining the crops. Please stop. Sir, this is my land. Sir, this is my field. Please stop! Father! Enough! We are surveying the land for the Fuji castle. If you interfere, you will be executed! Then you're going to expropriate our land for the castle? We don't know yet. We are just surveying in preparation for the competition. That person is the master castle architect, Kumaki Hakuten, here by orders of the Shogunate. Any one who says a single word opposing his work, will be considered an enemy of the Tokugawa Shogunate! Chamberlain, it seems that Sato will not be appearing. Then Sir Hakuten will be the builder... he will win by default. That may be Sir. But Sir... and Instructor Kuga... please take a look at this. The area within the red line is where I propose to build the castle. Then the villages and fields at the foot of Mount Fuji would all be destroyed. Sir Hakuten, wouldn't that cause excessive hardship? Sir, by order of the Shogunate, your Lord Mizuno is the Construction Minister. And...? It means that, in reality... the Mizuno clan must pay for the building of this Shogunate castle. In fact it's so. When our Lord Dewa was appointed, we, his vassals, were ordered to give up part of our stipend until castle construction was complete. It hits us both ways. So, for both our sakes, we should build where construction is easy and least expensive. In your esteemed judgement, wouldn't that be the best solution? Agreed. It will be up to the builder to decide where to build the castle. If we build on the land I've surveyed... the villagers will be available as a labor force. In this way, the funds alotted for labor will be freed up to be used as you wisely judge to be most suitable. I see. Sir Hakuten, you must win this competition. If only for the good of the Mizuno clan. Men of the village! Go to the shrine! Meet at the shrine before going to the fields! Hey! All men are to go to the shrine! Has the East Village been told? Yeah, I've already done it. The North and South Village men are already there. We shouldn't keep them waiting. What? That's ridiculous! If they choose Hakuten's plan... our lives will be ruined forever. If he succeeds... we'll never farm here again. I don't care if this is being done in the Shogun's name. We can't allow them to destroy our homes and fields. Keep it down! The officials will hear you. What do I care! Ours aren't the only lands around here. Let them build somewhere else! You're right. Somewhere else! It's too much. I won't take it anymore! I'm going to the Chamberlain! I'll petition Lord Dewa! Let's petition the Shogun! Idiot!.. If you do that... everyone will suffer. Then what can we do? Are we to do nothing? I didn't say that. When the time comes, I'll do the petitioning! Mayor! Listen up! Sir Hakuten isn't the builder yet. He still has to win the competition. But then... where's his rival, Professor Sato... it's only two days to the competition, and he hasn't even arrived yet. And he could be as bad as Hakuten. No, Professor Sato's not like that. I met him when I was in Edo on official business. He's educated. He's a man with a heart of gold! Then Mayor, we must beg Sir Sato to win the competition at all costs. Don't be daft. How can we rely on someone who isn't even here. Father! Father! Father! Father! He's over there. Father! Ishi. I said no women or children were to come here. But people from Edo are here to see Sir Sato. Professor Sato...? We are from his architecture school in Edo. This is Sir Sato's fiancee. Oh Fuji... Please! Miss Some is the late Master's daughter. Then Professor Sato is already here? Then where is he? He left Edo a month ago. We came to ask the Mayor where he was staying. Is that true? See. He didn't come! He's afraid of Hakuten and he's run away. Hey! Hakuten is leaving! Hey everyone! Calm down and listen to me. Professor Sato may be doing research nearby secretly preparing for the competition. There's two days left. Let's split up and find him. But where? He could be anywhere. Don't forget, there are hungry wolves roaming the foothills. Miss. You heard them. Do you have any idea where he might be? Yes. Where is Mt. Ashitaka? It's that mountain over there. If he's not staying here... from what he said before he left, he'll be somewhere on that mountain from where he has a good view of the area. From there he can plan his overall strategy. Professor Sato! Professor! Professor Sato! Professor! Professor Sato! Professor! Professor! Professor Sato! Sir Sato! Professor Sato! Professor Sato! I am Mayor Taiuemon of South Village. We have been looking for you since yesterday. Sir, regarding the castle, we, the people of all the villages in these foothills wish to throw ourselves on your mercy. Professor, say something. You should really get going. Only one day... the competition is tomorrow. And you keep looking at the view. That's okay with me. I know you very well. That's why I'm here, taking leave from my fireworks business. But, Professor... Ryukichi! Please fire one round of fireworks. We arranged to fire one round now. At Bishamon, the mountain-man Tsuneta is waiting. Professor Shosai is by the lake. And on Mt. Domyo... Genroku and his daughter Roku, and the cattle herder, Bunroku. And near the Shirogane falls... Sir Tamaki Sanae and his son, Sanosuke. They are all watching for the fireworks now. And if they can all see a fireworks round set off here... ... then those will be the four outposts of the castle. Which in turn will situate the main castle. Sir Professor! Then your plan doesn't require... destroying all our lands to build the castle? Of course not. The most suitable place for a castle shouldn't uproot the inhabitants... Sir Sato has looked at all possible sites in the foothills. Ryukichi! Professor Sato! Miss! Ryukichi! Miss! No, we can't get down from here. Everyone, go around. What has happened? Sir Sato! It's you, Fuji. Miss Some has fallen down the cliff. Fallen?! Yes, the loud sound frightened her. Damn it! This is from her kimono. Then she's been kidnapped. Look it's Sanpei. She's in danger. Watch out! Who is he? He's Hakuten's minion, a strange guy named Sanpei. Hakuten's...? Then there's no cause for concern. Oh no! Who knows what he might do to her. Miss Some has the secret castle manual from her father's library. She thought you'd need it, and was bringing it to you. She has it with her? Yes, sewn into her 'obi' (sash). Her obi? A day before the competition, you rescue a person. That is a good omen. Well, I still have to compete. Now way. Tomorrow's the first day, Lord Mizuno will be here any minute. Yet, we still haven't heard a word from Sato. Sir Sato. The fireworks experiment worked. Then it was visible from all four places? Yes, we did. Very clearly. You are brilliant to find a place in just one month. We have lived in the foothills all our lives. But you're work has surprised us all. Sanosuke, go immediately to Sanpusha. Yes, sir. Sir Sato, please go get Miss Some at once. Yes, we must hurry. So Sanosuke, what's this Sato like? Even better than we imagined. Father said so. But the Chamberlain backs Hakuten. He thinks Hakuten will win hands down. No, Professor Sato is the master builder. He's bound to win the competition. Property of Hakuten. As long as you have... this tattoo on your arm, you can't marry anyone else. Master, he's here. Sato is here. Is he? Sir Professor. We are counting on you. For the sake of everyone of us. Sato Kikutaro...? Kumaki Hakuten. Our Sekishin school is 500 years old. It was founded by Sekishinsai. Then Dainosuke, the second; Chizen, the third; Konoshin, the fourth; Shotaro, the fifth; Hinsaku, the sixth; Shitensai, the seventh. Manzo, the eighth, and Kanbei, the ninth. I am the tenth master of Sekinshin school. They say that I am as good as the founder. Our school goes back to the famous Dokan Ota. I inherited the school from late master Kinugawa. I am Sato Kikutaro of the Sanshi school. Now that introductions are over, I have a private matter to discuss. The woman on Mt. Ashitaka, Sanpei took a while ago. I need to know where she is. Don't worry about her. She is safe, resting in the back room. I am deeply relieved to hear that. She's... an acquaintance of mine. I will thank you, but please... Of course, I will have you taken to her. Sanpei, come here. Yes, sir. Show Sir Sato to the back room. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Hey! Sanpei! I don't know... Master! She's gone. Excuse me, aren't you Sato Kikutaro? Who are you? I am Nagasaka, Chamberlain of the Mizuno Clan. An honor, Sir. Thanks for coming. Sir Nagasaka, excuse my rudeness, but the person Sir Hakuten brought... I understand you have already spoken to Hakuten. Yes, we made our introductions. Is that all? Meaning...? Was there any other discussion? I asked about the woman Hakuten saved. I did ask him about her. Nothing else? Like what? I hear you have yielded the competition to him. Who said that? Hakuten himself. That's ridiculous! Sir Nagasaka, take me to Hakuten at once! I didn't mean to divulge your secret request. But these things do get out anyway. Hakuten, this is not your only lie. The lady was not in your back room. What's going on here? That's what I want to ask you. What? You said that this woman was an aquaintance of yours. That's right, but... You wanted to hide your relationship, so you took her away. No, it's all right. Sir Hakuten... Young men will sow their wild oats. Your deceit is an insult... The Lord has arrived! September 25th, 1805. The competition begins. Listen everyone. He is pulling out all the stops! Hakuten's castle tower uses the finest stones, and the castle will be self-sustaining. The moat will be surrounded by walls. Sounds like a monster castle to me. And Sato's castle? He wasn't in the least bit impressed. He said the best defense has to be a good offense. The purpose of building the Fuji castle... is to teach the Shogun's lords... offensive techniques to attack and defeat their enemies. Therefore... - Therefore, Hakuten's strategy of building a defensive castle is off the mark! He should go home and rethink... well, in actual fact... Sato didn't say exactly that, but... Shut up! You poor rats are blind and can't see what awaits you in the future! Who are you? Chokuren, the soothsayer. I can see that the winner is Kumaki Hakuten. Be careful or you will be squashed, flattened and done for. You, you and you! There is one amongst you who will betray you. That's the way with rats. You are so young, Sir Sato. The landmark here is obviously Mount Fuji. So, where do we put the castle? Once we decide, everything falls into place. It's simple... With Mount Fuji at our back, the enemy will be dazzled and not see the castle. Everyone knows that that's the best plan. So why are you opposed to it? That's absurd. First, the four corners. These must be decided carefully. The four corners and their outposts ensure a proper defensive strategy. Having Mount Fuji behind the castle... doesn't help in deciding the perimeter. The principles of castle building are based on... optimizing geographic advantage from a military point of view. If as you say, we decide based only on natural landmarks, then why would you need a master builder? We wouldn't need his skills. How courageous of you. But can you build a castle with a soul? Soul? You can't build a castle with arguments. A castle's a living thing. I agree it's a living thing. As with all living things... it has value only when placed in the right strategic location. And how could you know in advance this right strategic place? That decision must be based on the castle's mission and intended purpose. Empty words! The purpose and mission... can only be decided after the castle is built. When the castle threatens the livelihood of the people, they see it as a demon castle, inhabited by devils. What? Sir Kumaki, I see that the site you've chosen... is occupied by villages and fields. If you build a castle there... the wellbeing of these people will be destroyed. Is that the legacy you want for the Shogun's castle? Time's up. This section's concluded. But... I haven't finished. The land debate is over. Referees? We now move on to the building materials. But Lord, the debate wasn't concluded. Silence, Sanosuke. It's not your place to speak. It's not right. Sir Kumaki has not answered... Sir Sato's last point concerning the wellfare of the villages. Sanosuke, be quiet. Continue with the next topic. It's the custom to use local materials. That's true. And means of transport? With our long experience, our oxcarts are greatly improved. Good, we also have fine oxcarts. Second to none! Referees, please organize a race to see which oxcarts are superior. Agreed. The transport debate will now be decided by a race. As you know, Sir Sato, lumber for scaffolding... is vital to building a castle. In these foothills, how many trees of three feet in circumfrence... can be harvested? A little less than 500. I think that's plenty. 500? Are you crazy? We must have 700. No, closer to 800. Referees, let's make this another trial. I'm sorry to repeat myself... please Doctor, promise to keep this a secret. Don't worry yourself. I am bound by doctor-patient confidentiality. Can you remove it? Well... Can't you do it? I heard you were the best doctor. That's why... I overcame my shame and came to consult you. Lady... This is no ordinary tattoo. What do you mean? The dye is made of poisons and Chinese mud. It's an ancient Chinese method of permanent tattooing. The dye penetrates deep inside the skin, and won't fade for at least ten years. Please! I will bear any pain! Burn it off, please. I can't. The poison would be released... putting your life in danger. Wait! Forgive me if I'm mistaken... but aren't you... the lady who disappeared from the mountainside? Oh no, I'm not. Excuse me. I shouldn't presume. But just so you know, most of the people here... pray that Sir Sato will win. They hate and fear Hakuten. I'm one of them. I've heard that, sensing he couldn't win the debate... Hakuten bribed the Chamberlain and the referees. And like a child, he suggested tests... so he could use trickery to defeat Sir Sato. Oh no, you have a fever. I'm going to trust you. What is it? Take this. Give it to Sir Sato, a true friend of the people. Lady! Sanosuke, how did you get this? It's from Dr. Shosai. Father asked me to deliver it. And who gave it to Dr. Shosai? A sick lady being cared for by a maid named Fuji. I'm glad she's safe. I can't go to see her now, but... This is what I needed. I'll ask Ryukichi to build the oxcart like this. So what difference does 100 or 200 trees make? The castle will be built either way. I think so, too. But the Mayor is worried. Hakuten must be plotting something. Everyone, be careful! Hey, Bunroku. You will be driving Sir Sato's oxcart tomorrow. Make sure you win. My Bunroku is the best cattleman. He won't lose to anyone. Not in front of your father, child. But I wonder who Hakuten's driver will be. Who cares? If you lose, you can't marry my daughter! Hey! What is it? I know who Hakuten's driver is. Who is it? Who do you think it is...? It's you! Hakuten chose Genroku to divide the village... by pitting father vs. son-in-law. He's also trying to steal Sir Sato's secret. Use the rope we gave you and remeasure all the trees. But sir, these ropes are shorter than three feet. Shut up! I say it's three feet. But... If I tell you it's three feet, it's three feet! Understood? No cheating! What nonsense! Sato is sure to lose. The total for Mt. Echizen is 160. Add 26 more to Mt. Yobiko's count. We will combine Mt. Tokoi and Igai. Right now, the count is 203. Hey, there. My boss said to give you this. Take it. And you, make yourself scarce. Then appear at the oxcart race, and drive for my boss, Hakuten. Look! Anyone who opposes my boss will end up like that rabbit. You'd better think about that. So, Sir Sato. How many bodies of water are there? There are a total of seven lakes. And the number of rivers? Two rivers and 13 tributaries. Impressive, and the seven lakes, which way does the current run? That seven includes rain holes. There are four true lakes. Then what about the current of the four lakes? They all flow to the right. Sir Sato, that's generalizing. Of the four lakes, the one you chose for one of the outer forts... has two different flows. It flows right by the shore, but left in the center. Remember that. Please add this as one of the tests. Here is the result of the timber survey. The total is 730. Therefore, the winner of the timber survey round is Kumaki Hakuten. Sir Kumaki. I will give instructions for tomorrow's oxcart race. Please call your drivers forward. Cattleman Genroku, South Village, come forward. South Village cattleman Bunroku, come. Bunroku? Where is Bunroku? Come forward! Bunroku isn't here. What have you done to Bunroku? Have you hidden him? Don't know. I don't know! So the oxcart race is postponed for one day, and they will survey the flow of the lake first. Father. If Hakuten uses underhanded methods to win... can he really be declared the winner? Sanosuke, what are you saying? You are heir to the Tamaki clan... keepers of the Shogun's tea canister. Sister, I am very upset about this. I know, but a true Samurai would not speak this way. But Mother... Sanosuke... It's true that the good don't always receive justice. But that doesn't mean that justice does not exist. Justice exists. It always will. Where, you ask? It's in the spirit to fight. It exists in fighting fair. You have learned this as a key principle of your martial arts training. You must never forget it. Don't you have guard duty tonight? You must go to Sanpusha now. Yes, sir. SANPUSHA SERVICE GATE Master. You will lose the current contest. I checked today and everything flows to the right. I know that. Then why? Look, Sanpei. Did you see that? The current contest was to lure Sato to the lake. I kill him, and I win. And in the current contest, Sir Sato Kikutaro wins. Sir Sato wins! You are good. Now we each have one win. Tomorrow's oxcart pull will decide the contest. Say, do you know if the bottom of this lake is sand or mud? Weeds grow on the bottom in mud mixed with sand. Oh, I would like to try an experiment, then. Please prepare a small boat. Someone, bring a boat. Yes, sir! We have to win the oxcart pull at any cost. Mayor, have you picked Bunroku's alternate? No... will someone please volunteer? But Hakuten's driver, Genroku is a veteran. None of us could ever beat him. Heisaku, don't be so pessimistic. I'm not... How about you, then? No way! You? Anyone but me. I will do it! Sato, I'm going to sink this pole three times. Please watch carefully from the boat. I will. First, from the bow. Oh, I failed. Next, from the stern. Failed again. Once more. Watch out! SANSHI SCHOOL AKABARI SCHOOL Ready! Don't strain them! They'll fade before the end. Silence! Calm down. You must be patient. Intruder! Mother! Sir Sato, you won this round, so you win the competition. But there is one thing that bothers me. What's that? I don't understand why you chose this valley... as one of the outposts. I made it clear in the debate. I don't recall. Ok, I will demonstrate. Give me an arrow. Please watch carefully. There are several wind caves in the valley... causing the wind to blow in all directions. This is an ideal place to train troops... to adapt strategy to environment. I will take you to the wind cave for inspection. Wait! The thing that Sato's horse broke looks like an antique tea canister. This is the Mizuno clan's treasure, the tea canister in the Tamaki family's keeping. Sanosuke! Where is Sanosuke? Here, sir! Sanosuke, explain this. I want Sanai! Bring Tamaki Sanai to me. This tea canister was the Shogun's gift. To lose it is a dereliction of duty. If intentional, it's treason. Either way, Tamaki, the keeper, must commit harakiri to atone. Sato. Although an accident, you are guilty as well. You must pay for this. Sir Nagasaka... I am an experienced horseman. I would have known if my horse broke it. First, investigate how it came to be here. What? I saw someone enter the wind cave. I'll go! Kikutaro is buried alive? The whole village will have to dig him out. I'll go, too! No, Miss! You are ill, please stay here. Leave it to us. The professor is buried alive! All you men, come with me! All women, prepare food. Hurry! You rats! I see everything! I knew Kumaki Hakuten would win I could see it from the start. This is the winner's fan, from the Shogun himself. Take it with honor and respect. From this day forward... my, Hakuten's orders, are the same as the Shogun's. Those who disobey will be executed on the spot. All local men, young and old... are ordered to become laborers. Go! The Lord's orders! You are under arrest! Sister! We must not die! I will live to fight this injustice. I do this because I am loyal to my lord. Father! Mother! I swear to avenge your death and clear our name. Sir Sato! Quick! Hide Miss Some! This way! Everyone! Come! What's going on? All men must become laborers for the castle. But that's... Shut up! All those who opposed Hakuten during the contest will be punished. You will be informed later. How dare you? Don't let them get away! Help! Let him go! Pa! Don't interfere! I wonder if he's all right. It's been half a day already. Sir Kikutaro! Miss! Sir Kikutaro! Professor! Sir Sato! Oh! Ryukichi! Sir Sato is alive! Hey! Bring some rope. We need rope! Pull! Professor! Professor! Ryukichi! Professor! Sir Kikutaro! Miss Some... Hold on, professor! Everyone! I'll return to town with the Chamberlain, then go to Edo and report. I'll leave Oda and his men to help catch the rebels. I thank you. I have received money for the laborers. Here is your portion of the take. When the cornerstone of the castle is laid, you and Lord Dewa will be invited to Edo. I will invite you to the red-light district, then. I look forward to it. Please... Winning is everything. I will crush anyone or anything that gets in my way. That is my method. Father! There's nothing we can do. No use in you getting caught, too. Father! Roku! Bastard! Murderer! Beast! Father and Bunroku did what you told them to do. So why do they have to die? Why?! How dare you! Wait Ganryu! Take her into custody. Roku! Bunroku! I deserve this for betraying my village. Stop! Ten oxcarts! Go to the east... The foundations must be laid. We must hurry and lay the blocks! Sir Kikutaro! I was dreaming... Did I speak? No. I dreamed I was the castle builder. Miss Some... I feel so useless. Don't say that. You won the competition. Who will believe that? I do. I let your late father down. I'm sure my father knows the truth. As a man who studied military tactics... I'm ashamed I didn't see through Hakuten. He caught me off-guard. I just wasn't good enough. Must you blame yourself this way? What should I do? Miss Some. Yes? Could I have some hot water? Good... Do you weep for me? What has become of the villagers? Taken as laborers, captured as rebels, murdered...! When will I be well enough? For the villagers, I must recover... Miss! There's someone coming! Professor Sato! Sir Sato! Sanosuke! Miss Miyo! Miss Some. These are the Tamaki children. Sanosuke saved me and Yuki. We ran and hid, then got Miss Miyo out of hiding and finally... I'm glad you are all safe. Where is Taiuemon? He is dead. As I feared. So is Tsuneta, Yasaku, Gensaku and Heiji. So is Bunroku, and Genroku who betrayed us. And so is Doctor Shosai. What, Shosai, too? They are all gone, all gone. Professor! This place will become unsafe very soon. You must return to Edo. To the capital. Even Hakuten can't have his way there. And there are many good doctors there. You must regain your health. And what will you do, Sanosuke? I will stay here with my sister, and avenge my father and mother! Please open! I'm sorry it's late. Please open the door. Please come in. Professor! The room is this way. I'm sorry to wake you up so late. Sato Kikutaro! I arrest you as a rebel. You inhuman beast! I will kill you! You couldn't hurt a fly. Look! Arrest him! Stop! Hurry! Ryukichi! Professor, escape! Miss Some! Please! Get him away! The days pass, till the day arrives to lay the cornerstone. Because the foundation is not going well, Hakuten is going to bury young women and sacrifice them. Is this true? Yes. And there are many good doctors there. And they are to draw straws. Draw straws? Then my daughter, too? Human life is more precious than this castle. Damn him. I won't let them do it. What did you say? You old bag of bones! Forgive me! Damn you! Hey! Rokuji. Stop, crazy woman! How dare you address Sir Hakuten. Shut up! Rokuji, it's me. Have you forgotten me?! I am the one who raised you! I have been waiting for this day! The day you lay the cornerstone! I have waited 40 years to rejoice with you! Kazubei. Chase this crazy woman away! Rokuji! Rokuji! Listen well, you four. Tomorrow is the day we lay the cornerstone. Lord Mizuno Dewa will be here, and you will be buried in the earth as sacrifices. You must have done bad things in your life, but through my intervention, Lord Dewa has given you white robes to wear. Accept this gratefully. Carry on. Go away! Come back to Hakuten. You returned to Sanpusha after all. Don't you know this is your fate? This is my last offer... Be my mistress. If you do, I will treat you well. I will only give myself to Sir Sato! Come on. I'll show you who's boss. I would rather bite my tongue and die! All right. You will taste hell while you're alive. Then tomorrow you will die as you wish. You! Sanpei! I will punish you for your sins. Rokuji. How dare you plan to kill me. Do you think it will bring you good fortune? Sanosuke, Miss Miyo, look! This is the same weapon that killed your mother. So Sanpei, on Hakuten's order, stole the tea canister and killed your mother. This is for my father and mother. Prepare yourself! Nothing to do with me. Sanosuke, make sure you kill him. Lower her. Down! Lower her! Lower her. Get on. Down. My Lord. Go! Wait! Stop this ritual! For the sake of the country, for the Shogunate, and for Fuji castle... I, Sato Kikutaro, oppose this ceremony and this castle's builder. That is why I have come! Rebel and criminal Sato Kikutaro! You must be mad to come here today! Stand down, I have no use for you. Silence! I speak only to Lord Dewa Mizuno. In all of Japan, in the history of building castles, there has never been an offering of human sacrifice. Shut up! You have no right to interfere. No man is above or below his fellow man. The same goes for the castle. Building on superstition is no longer acceptable. That practice was abandoned long ago. How dare you challenge my reputation! You are a disgrace to our profession. You used this position to satisfy your greed. You schemed with the counselors to embezzle funds for your own purse. You brought the wrath of the villagers onto this castle. I have witnesses. Come and explain to the Lord! Professor! How dare you? Begone! Wait! Day after day, we are forced to work on the castle. Our fields and crops have been destroyed. We are never paid, we bring our own food. We will have no rice this season. We won't be able to pay our rice taxes. The only thing left for us is to die. You think this is the way to build a castle? Hakuten also tried to kill everyone who defied him. Yuki! Yes! Just because Father and others sided with Sir Sato, they were all beheaded. If you were good, we would have helped you, too. If you were just, we would have respected you. Sanosuke, Miss Miyo, come forward. Hakuten, you used Sanpei to kill my mother. You bade him steal the Lord's tea canister, and intentionally destroy it. I see! You were the ones who killed Sanpei. We told him we were avenging our parents. It was a duel of honor. The dead can't talk. You are trying to save yourselves... by blaming it all on Sanpei. You really think the dead can't talk? What? I have a witness to this revenge killing. Can we believe your witness? Who is it? The woman who brought you up. Bring her! Rokuji, I am a soothsayer, I know everything. I have never seen her before. I know you have a large birthmark on your chest. Hakuten, any more excuses? Kill him! Kill them all. Die! Lord Dewa, permit the Tamaki children to avenge the death of their parents. Sanosuke, Miyo... I didn't know. Forgive me. Kill Hakuten. Yes, my lord! I, Sato Kikutaro, will assist them. Go help Miss Some! Miss Some! Miss Some! Hey! Look! I will deal with both of you later. You are under house arrest. Miss Some! Sir Kikutaro! Wait! Hakuten, you coward! Wait, you two! You have permission to use my horses. Go after him! Yes, my lord! Hakuten, prepare to die! I won't! Hakuten! No filthy tricks. Die like a samurai! Coward. Come back! Stop, Hakuten! Sanosuke. Use your shuriken! Curse him! No final winner of the competition was ever recorded... and Fuji castle was never completed. Sir Taiuemon, Sir Shosai... you countless villagers who gave your lives... You did not die in vain. The people of these foothills live in peace again. People, care for this precious land... and pass it down in good condition to future generations. It's what those who have sacrificed their lives would want. Farewell, everyone. I will dedicate my life to building castles. Professor! Miss Some. Please come back to visit us. Goodbye, all of you. So long.
