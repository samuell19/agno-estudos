Commander rigs to home ship. Initiating final timenado approach. Right behind you, Commander rigs. Skips, muscle man, port and starboard gun. Yes, admiral. Yes, admiral. Pops, you're up top. Okay. Follow my lead. Go! Go! Go! Come on, rangers! It's the temporal crystal. Now we destroy it. Skips. Mm. Aw, yeah. Good job, rangers. Mission objective almost accomplished. Now to let our guard down for just one second. Ugh! Muscle man. Huh? Ooh! Over there! Take cover! Fives! Cease fire. Rigby and Benson, you're outnumbered. Dude, you can totally stop this bloodshed. Give up. Hey, traitor, how's the hand holding up? You might want to listen to your little friend here, while you're still alive. Go stuff it, Ross. Yeah, you need to chill out, man. Forget all this erasing-time business. Chill out?! Oh, I think I was pretty chilled out when I went to prison because of you and Mordecai's little stunt back in high school. But I guess I should thank you for creating this wonderful weapon. What are you talking about? Mordecai and rigby created the timenado. What? Liar! Oh, I'm The liar?! Ha! That's a good one! Isn't that a good one, Mordecai? Yeah, hilarious. I know what you did, rigby, and I'll never forgive you! Dude, I didn't get in. Commander rigby! It was such a long time ago. I didn't do anything. I don't need you to tell me what you did. If we get out of here, could you fix it? Rigby, fix this. That's an order. No, admiral! Run! Run! This one's for pops! And skips! And muscle man! And fives! Ha! Stupid! Stupid! Time circuits on. Take me back to high school. Got to fix this. Calculating time jump. Stop that ship in the name of lord Ross. What happened to you, man? How could you work for Him? I couldn't stay at the park forever. I had to think of my career. How about your friends? We're not friends. We haven't been friends for a long time. Course plotted. Press that button, and I will shoot you. Hey, Mordecai... Go ahead! Wha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a... ♪ What's up, Eileen? ♪ ♪ You're the queen of the coffee beans ♪ ♪ Fill them up, fill them up ♪ ♪ Can't start the day without a cup ♪ You know, you could just ask for a refill like normal people. What's up, though? I never see you guys here this early. Breakfast burritos from the truck outside. Best burritos in the city! It's the name of the place, but it's actually pretty good. Eh, I've never subscribed to ordering food from a vehicle. What time are you guys supposed to be at work, though? Oh, no. Dude, I thought you said you gassed up the cart. Mm, yeah, what I meant was, I didn't gas up the cart, let's go get breakfast burritos. Ow! Would it kill you to tell the truth every once in a while? Wait! Where are you going?! Come on. We can't be late again! Meeting in 10, skips. Oooh! Hey, what the... It's a free country! Hey, guys, meeting in eight. Ugh! You know who else has a meeting in eight? My mom! Ow! Cramp! Cramp! Power through it, dude! Meeting in five, pops. Oooh, jolly good show! Ugh! Get up. Come on! Mordecai. Rigby. Meeting in... Of course. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! We're here! Aah! We're here! We made it! We made it on time. Ha! Ha! Uh, yeah, you're not on time because the morning meeting's already over! Sorry, Benson. We would have been here sooner, but the cart ran out of gas. You know who doesn't run out of gas? Leave! Good luck, fellas. Bad show. You know, you can't just walk into work whenever you feel like it. We have rules here. And when you break the rules, you're gonna pay the consequences. Wait, pay the consequences, or face the consequences? Face the consequences. Face the consequences! What are those? These are pink slips. One with your name on it, and one with yours on it. And now it's time for me to say the words I've been waiting to say for a long time. You're fired! No, Benson, you can't! Yeah, we got a good excuse! Oh, really? What's that? We bought you breakfast burritos. What? You know, just to say we're sorry for messing up at work all the time, right, Mordecai? Uh, yeah. Best burritos in the city. Dude, that was awesome! When did you write his name on the bag? Pretty much the whole time he was talking. The old "writing notes behind the back" trick. Mastered that one back in high school. Yeah, the only flaw in your plan is that now I'm starving. Yeah, me too. You want to sneak off and get some food? Nah, Benson's been watching us this whole time. I think we're gonna have to ride this out until dinner. Pfft, yeah, right. If we have to go that long before taking a break, then I'm gonna start looking for another job. Yeah, right. You wouldn't leave the park. I don't know, dude. I'm just saying. It's not like we can just keep working at the park forever, you know? Whatever. You say that now. I don't know, man. But I just think it's something we really should be... run! Dude, you can't run away from the future! Aah! Aah! Get off, dude. You guys all right? Whoo-o-o-o! That was awesome! What did you do?! It wasn't us! Yeah, that meteor came out of nowhere. Uh, I don't think that's a meteor, guys. Whoa! It looks like some sort of vehicle. A spaceship. There's got to be a door somewhere. Rigby, no! Get away from there! Dude, what are you doing? Relax, I just want to check it out. Aaah! I can't be abducted, bros. I'm probe sensitive. Ugh! That's a weird-looking alien. Dude, he looks like you. Yeah, but way cooler. Help. Oh, geez! That doesn't look good. That's not good, right? Unh-unh. Who are you? It's me. Rigby. I've traveled back from the future to seek your help. But how can you be rigby? You look so awesome. Thanks. I really grew into it. The universe is on the verge of being destroyed. And it's all because you tried to make a time machine in high school. What? What? What is he talking about? How can that be? Rigby, what did you do? What?! Nothing! Oh, yeah, I'm sure. Is this for real right now? But I like the universe! Stop talking! That failed time machine was the genesis of a massive timenado. A timenado? A time-what? Timenado... a tornado that can travel through space and time. Come on, Benson, keep up. Wait, wait, but I thought we just blew up the science lab. That's what I thought, too, but it turns out what we did created something far more destructive. The timenado was a phenomena of great power. Its terminal energy creates portals through time, normally harmless. But now has been harnessed and weaponized by a madman called Ross. Mr. Ross? Our old teacher? The one and only. Ross is using the timenado to suck up earth's timeline. Entire pieces of the future are being erased. Portals start appearing one after the other, ripping through the fabric of time until nothing is left. Years, whole decades... gone in an instant. The intergalactic park rangers have been trying to stop it to no avail. Mordecai and rigby, you need to go back in time to stop us from trying to make that time machine or all of time will be erased. Well, why us? Yeah, why didn't you go back and stop it? I was trying to, but getting shot kind of changed the plan. What happened? Who shot you? Him. Oh, my! You shot me?! What? No! I didn't do anything. Whoa, you guys stop being friends? How could that happen? Rigby, come here... Closer. Don't. Aw, man! Don't make the same mistake I did. Dude, come on! You have to tell the truth, even if it means losing Mordecai. It's the only way to save the universe. This is crazy. It's crazy. What was he talking about? Time being destroyed? I... I... I... I... I... Why don't you tell us about this time machine? Well, all we wanted after high school was to go to college u together. But rigby got in, and I didn't. So we tried to build a time machine to fix it. But it exploded and destroyed the whole science lab. Whoa! Wait, rigby got accepted, and you were rejected? But rigby doesn't know anything about anything. Hey! You must've really tanked on that college essay. Pfft. Yeah, who knows. We both got expelled, and our science teacher, Mr. Ross, got fired. Rigby didn't graduate and lost his scholarship to college university. And I ended up just going to junior college. Rigby crashed with me at my dorm, I dropped out of college, and then we loafed around for a bit, we got this job at the park... okay, okay. I think we're caught up, monologue Johnson. I don't understand. How can Mordecai and rigby stop being friends? If they can't make it, then you and me have no chance. Yeah, bro. What was the future you saying about you having to tell the truth or something? Did Mordo blow you away over some crazy secret? Uh, what? No. I-I don't know. It must be something that happens in the future. This can't be happening. This has to be a prank. This has to be a prank. Muscle man, I won't even be mad at you if you just tell me you're orchestrating all of this. Bro, I'm somewhat flattered that you'd think my craft is at this level, but, ultimately, I'm deeply offended that "a"... you think I'd put my buds through this turmoil, and "b"... that you'd think I'd listen to orchestra music! Well, I don't know what you guys are trying to pull with all this... Dude, if we wanted to get out of work, we'd just play video games. I think this is for real, man. Skips, come on. I have a feeling we should take this seriously. What?! How can we even know that this thing is really from the future?! Guys, check out this sweet future gun I found in that ship! Whoo! Cool! Awesome! Muscle man, no! Wait! Pew. Pew. Pew. Pew. Muscle man, put that down before you break it. Chill, bro. I don't even think it works. Oh, wait. Whoa! Whoo! This baby's legit! We got to go. We got to go. We're going. Skips, want to help save the universe? I'm in. Muscle man? Fives? You know it, bro. Yeah, for sure. Pops? Anything to help you two out of a pickle jar. Okay, three minutes, everyone. Grab some supplies and meet back at the ship. My car. I just paid it off. Hey, Benson, painting the steps is gonna have to wait. Got to go save the universe. Benson, come on. We don't have much time. But I just bought a new air freshener. ♪ I studied nuclear science, I love my classes ♪ ♪ I got a crazy teacher, he wears dark glasses ♪ ♪ Things are going great ♪ ♪ And they're only getting better ♪ ♪ I'm doing all right, getting good grades ♪ ♪ The future's so bright ♪ ♪ I got to wear shades ♪ ♪ I got to wear shades ♪ Make it tighter. Tighter! Hmm. Hey, guys, who's gonna fly this thing? Whoa! It's just like... All the controls are... One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Oh-h-h-h! Ugh, we should have played punchies. Wait, Rigby's driving? He doesn't even have a license! Come to papa. Welcome back, lieutenant rigby And galactic park rangers. We're flying! Whoo! Whoo! Wait. Where's my stash? Where's my stash? Oh, no, bro. Calculating time route. May 28th... 6 years, 4 months Into the past. Bingo. Hold onto your butts. What? What'd he say? Aaaaah! Hey, dude, I heard they started sending out letters for college u. Do you think we got in? Yeah, man, everyone gets into that school. That's why we applied. Dude, we're going to college u! Who-o-o-oa! Our lives rule. Aaah! Well, well, well. If it isn't the state-championship ruiner. You cost us the game, state-championship ruiner! Dude, it was an accident stay out of this, Mordecai. This is between me and volleyball state-championship ruiner McGee. Whatever, Jablonski! I told you that wasn't me! Oh, yeah?! We got proof! Thank you! Rigby! See? Could have been anybody. Ow! Oh! Ow! What's going on here?! Oh, principle Dean, we were just helping rigby with his homework. Everyone knows he's not doing so hot in school, when it comes to the studies, right? This isn't the Francis Jablonski show! Now get to class! All of you! Francis... You, save your laughs cause Mr. Ross needs to talk to you asap. What? Why? I don't know! Something about you failing science or something. Just go talk to him. I don't think this school can handle another year of the rigby! Why did rigby have to drive? Is everyone okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. Engine damage critical. That's not good. Skips, can you fix it? I'll take a look. Muscle man, give me a hand. Looks like the coast is clear. Race you to the top. Whoa. Whoa. We're definitely in the past. Yeah. What's so funny? Good question. We'll have to mull-et over. Okay, okay, we're not far from the high school. Let's go destroy the time machine. Tell me what's so funny. Hup, hai. Come on, Schwartzman! Platform! Platform! Look, rigby, you're terrible at science. That's why you're failing and probably won't graduate. What? Ooh, come on, bring it, bring it. Ohhhh, look at them hops, Wally! Nice! Let's hit the showers, gentlemen. Aw, rigby, come on. Don't cry on my court. I wasn't finished. Principle Dean is forcing me to let you do a last-minute science project to pass. So there. Really? Oh-h-h-h-h! I'm gonna graduate. I'm gonna graduate. Unh, unh, unh, unh... Unh. Huh? Oh, wait. Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross. Uh, what kind of science project? Uh, no, if you want to graduate, you have to come up with something on your own, rigby. Well, could you just give me an example? Ugh, fine! You're the worst! This is a project I'm Working on. Cool. Cool. What is it? A time machine. Whoa! Whoa! Does it work? Soon. It's pretty complex. It's like when you try and make artisanal bread, but a thousand times more complicated. You guys want to see something even cooler? Whoa! Whoa! Yep. Grade-a plutonium. One stick of this in my time machine and I'll be time traveling like that guy in that movie about time traveling. So, what are you gonna do when you finish your time machine, Mr. Ross? Two things... go back and win the volleyball state championship, duh. And then... Get revenge. And that's why you're the coolest, Mr. Ross. I'm glad you think so. You'd probably change your mind if you knew who I was getting revenge on. Yeah. Yeah. Here. Just make a science project sometime this afternoon, and I'll pass you. Okay, thanks, Mr. Ross. Aw, yeah-yah! College u. College u. College who? Me and you. You're welcome. How are we going to get in and destroy the time machine? We're going to need to blend in, pops. Ooh, like a smoothie? Yeah. Yeah! Hello. Smoothie time. Benson, no, wait. Benson, the vbjs hate us here. You can't wear those. Vb-what? Volleyball jocks. Volleyball? Pfft, just play it cool, guys. There's the lab. Come on. It's locked. Move. Come on. Open! We have to save the universe! Benson, stop. I know where the key is. Mr. Ross gave it to our younger selves. It's lunchtime. We're probably at Paparelli's. Hey! What are you doing with our jackets, huh? Hey, Mordecai and rigby, do you know these clowns? No. No. Wait, are you guys wearing old-person make-up? Run! Run! Meet at Paparelli's! What? Hold it! Whoa. Whoa. Take it easy, guys. Sorry about the mix-up. We have jackets just like these, right, pops? Yes, our jackets are crimson-colored, as well. Your jackets are red, too? What are you, from Riverdale? Yeah, I bet they're from Riverdale. Looks like we got ourselves a couple of 'daleys. No, no, we're not from Riverdale. How about we show them what we're gonna do to Riverdale at next year's state finals? Yeah, let's show them. Oh! Set me up, Schwartzman. No, no, don't set him up. Aaah! Aaaah! We're not from Riverdale. Hmm. Yes! What's the damage, doc? Eh, too early to tell. I got to get my tools. Just stay here and guard the ship. Don't worry, skips. We're not going anywhere. I got to use it. Yeah, me too. This thing's got to have a bathroom, right? Bingo. What the... Where's the toilet? Uh... Uh... Uh... Forget this! I'm going in the bushes! You said it. Whoa, bro. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Crash pit! Crash pit! Lunchtime! Lunchtime! Paparelli's, get in my belly. Pizza and arcade, lunch hour's got it made. What's up, gino? Ah, my two favorite worst customers who never buy anything. You two staying out of trouble? Yeah. Yeah. You know why you two are my favorite? You remind me of myself and my old best friend, Ricky. We were inseparable. Well, until we went to different colleges. Now he's dead. To me. He's dead to me. He runs a competing pizzeria in Riverdale. That piece of trash stole my sauce recipe! Ugh, never mind. Here, take a slice. Thanks, gino. Thanks, gino. Dude, we can't let that happen to us. You got to graduate. You figure out what you gonna do for that project? I don't know. I was just thinking about putting my name on a bunch of fireworks and launching them at the principal's car. That's science, right? No, dude. Okay, well, something else really awesome. I'll think of something. Oh, what?! Galactic runner 2! This must have just come out. This wasn't here yesterday. You got a quarter? Yeah. Dude, it's us. Pfft, I still can't get over how lame your bleached hair was. Shut up. It was cool. So, what's the plan? Okay, so we just need to get them to let us into the science lab, and then we can find the time machine and destroy it. Okay, yeah, we'll just tell them we're here to help them. Oh, wait, do you think talking to ourselves is gonna screw up time or anything? What if we explode or implode or something? Shoot. No, wait. But future you came and talked to you and nothing happened. Well, he died. Yeah, but that was only because I shot you. Oh, yeah. Dude, dude, dude, get it, get it! I got it. Worry about your guy. Quit mashing the buttons. We got next. Pfft. Well, we might be a while. Rigby better watch out for that alien ship. What alien ship? Oh! Man, that came out of nowhere! Ugh! You got to take the hidden warp to level two to bypass the ship. How do you know that? We've had a couple of years to master it. But this game's brand-new. Not when you're from the future. Whoa, what?! Yeah, man. It's me. How is this possible? Dude, wasn't Mr. Ross building a time machine? None of that's important right now. We're just here to help... wait. How do we know you're who you say you are? Yeah. If you're really us from the future, what's on the back of his deck? Oh, a dumb drawing of our made-up character seсor sensei. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! So, why are you guys here? Do you need us to help you save the universe or something? Pfft, no, we're here to help you finish your science project. Whoa! Really? Sweet, dude, more help! Yeah, it's, uh, pretty important that you graduate. Did I get into college u? Yeah, we totally got in, man! Whoo! Awesome! Yeah! What about me? Did I get in, too? Uh... I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise. Yeah! Awesome! So, uh, we should probably get going to that lab, right? Wait, but I still don't know what to do for my project? Oh, uh, just, uh... Just build a volcano. That's what I did. Okay! Building a volcano with my future bros! Who-o-o-oa! "Dear, Mr. Ross, thanks for the extra credit. I lava science." "Rigby." Dude, you spelled your name wrong. Ahhh! There. Can't even notice. Don't worry, dude. I misspell my name all the time. See, anyone can make that mistake. Yeah, but you're the same... never mind. So, what's happening with you guys now? Uh, we're gonna disappear back to the future. Yeah, but we can't do it with you watching. Cool. Thanks for the help, guys. You saved my butt. Time to go celebrate. Graduation, here we come. Thanks again, dudes. Later. Come on. Here it is. Ready? Ready. Universe saved! Universe saved! Ha! Ha! Universe saved! Universe saved! Uh, yeah, we did that already. Did you already get spiked in the head like a volleyball, too? 'Cause that happened! We told you to run. A little late, rigby! Guys, can we please just get out of here? I don't want those volley fellows coming back. You're right, pops. Well, I suppose you guys actually came through for once. Good job. Yeah, we did! Who-o-o-oa! Good show. Nice try, fellas. But soon it'll be time to set the game-winning spike. I should probably get that checked out. All right, now to get back to doing what we do best... guarding a spaceship that's our only hope to get back home... Is this the right crater? What did you do? Nothing, skips. Honest. We just went to the bathroom real quick, and when we came back, the ship was gone. The ship doesn't even work. How can it be gone? And why are you naked?! You know what? I'll... I'll go over there. How in the world could this happen? "I ate from the trash at Paparelli's." Hey, muscle man, didn't you have a shirt like that six years ago? Yeah. Oh, no, bro. We crashed a lot of things in this crash pit over the years. But I have a feeling this is gonna be the best. You know it, bro. Huh! Huh! What the... Take the wheels, fives. Ohhhh. What do you think you're doing, bro? Huh? What the... What the... Why can't I fight you, man? 'Cause I'm you, bro. And you're not driving this ship into the crash pit. Whatever. You can't tell me what to do, old man. Actually, I can, because I know something that you don't. What's that? Always guard your pepperonis. Huh! Aaaah! Aaah! Next time, use the space toilet! Don't worry, skips. For the rest of this trip, I'm holding it. Aaah! Huh? Well, did you guys save the universe? Does this answer your question? Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?! Sorry. We found it in skips' van. You can't celebrate without dumping sports drink on somebody. Skips, how much longer till you can get us out of here? Give me 20 minutes. Okay, until then, I'm gonna go try and find a shower. Does this ship have a bathroom? Uh, you might not want to use that, bro. All right, man, it's over. Yeah-uh. Well, I guess I won't shoot you in the future anymore. So that's cool. Although we never really found out why that happened anyways. Yeah, that's a relief. Man, I wonder if any other stuff in the future changed. Oh, no. Yeah, you're probably right. Uh, I got to go. What? I have to go do something. Just don't leave without me. Huh? Rigby? Rigby! Whoa! Yes! It's here! Aw, yeah, it's got my name on it and everything! You guys want to get the camera ready? Okay, okay, after, after, after. I didn't get in? But... Everybody gets in. What... what am I supposed to do now? Listen, rigby, we were kind of expecting this so we looked up an out of state school where... out of state? But I'm supposed to go to college with Mordecai. Listen, this is the only college that will accept you. Well, then, I won't go to college then! Rigby, you're going to college whether you like it or not! If I can't go to college with Mordecai, then I don't want to go to college at all! Welcome to college u... the college that accepts Everybody. Meh! How are we gonna stay friends if we go to different schools? What if he got rejected, too? Sorry, Mordecai. Aaah! Dude, did you see all that lightning? Must be a storm a-brewing. Huh? Aw, sweet. Is that your acceptance letter? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I got in. Whoa! Dude, I knew you could do it. Yeah. Thanks. Dude, I got my letter, too. "Dear Mordecai..." Hm, hm. "We regret to inform you that you have been rejected from college university." Dude, I didn't get in. What the... Ugh! Dude, they let you in but not me? That doesn't make any sense. No offense. Hey, forget them. If you're not going to college u, then neither am I. No. I have a better idea. What? Do you still have the key to the science lab? Yeah. I need your help finishing Mr. Ross' time machine. No, wait! You have to tell Mordecai the truth! Please! Huh? Mr. Ross?! The one and only. Jerk move, changing Mordecai's letter like that. But I guess you're kind of the king of jerk moves. Like that time you ruined my volleyball state championship. What? That was an accident. Oh, yeah? I wonder what would happen if I accidentally showed Mordecai Your Little secret. It's over, Ross! We destroyed your time machine, so just get out of here! Oh, that doesn't matter. I'll just replace it with this. No! I wouldn't want to stop your high-school selves from blowing up the science lab and creating the timenado. Ooh, got to run. They'll be here in a few minutes. No! Bye. Aaah! No! No! No! Try it again, pops! Phew, for a minute there, I thought we'd be stuck in the past. Uh, guys, maybe we shouldn't leave quite just yet. The portals. Something must still be wrong what?! But the time machine was destroyed. Well, are you sure? Yes! Yes! Then why is time still being erased?! Wait! Wait! We can't. We... we can't go. Rigby, what's going on? There's a second time machine, and our past selves are headed to the high school to finish it! What?! Everybody, get in the van. We got to get to the high school now. What's going on, rigby? Uh, I'll explain later. We just have to go now. Yeah, dude, this is the only way. We finish Mr. Ross' time machine, then we can go back in time, and I can tell myself to get better grades. I'll get accepted this time, and we can both go to college u. Dude, that is... Such a great idea! I could totally tell myself the same thing. But why would you need to get better grades? You already got in. Oh, right. Yeah, never mind. Come on, help me put this weapons grade plutonium into the time machine. Go! Go! Go! Hurry! This way! We still have time! Stop. Out of our way, buddy! Yeah, this doesn't concern you, mysterious hooded bro. Oh, I think it does. Dude, it's... it's me. In the flesh. You're the future Mordecai that shot the future me in the future. Yeah, but you deserved it. Guys, guys, chill out. The show hasn't even started yet. Mr. Ross?! The one and only. Step aside, Ross. No can do. I need past Mordecai and rigby back there to create the timenado so I can get revenge on rigby. You're crazy! Yeah, I'm craze-o, all right! And as soon as I get my revenge, I'm gonna destroy the earth and then just live on my sweet spaceship and watch tons of TV. I recorded the past 25 years worth, so I've got a little catching up to do. They can't stop all of us! Come on! Oooh! Oh, man. Wait, duh. Can't make a time machine without adding a little time. Bros, you're blocking my shot! Aaah! So easy. You know what else is easy? Huh? Huh? This. Yes! Heh. Rewind collar. Good thing, too. I don't want to miss this. Aaah! Aaah! What are you guys doing here?! The timenado! The timenado! Ooooh! Aaaah! Aaah! No! Rigby, what did you do?! I'm sorry, mister. We didn't mean to... don't you get it? You just created the timenado again... the whole reason we're here! What? Why didn't anyone tell us? Yeah, we didn't know. Oh, man, this is gonna be too good. Mr. Ross? What happened to you? Time traveling as much as I have hasn't treated me well. But it's all about to pay off. Why don't you tell Mordecai the real reason you were trying to finish my time machine? But rigby was just helping me so we could go to college u together. Oh, yeah. You don't know. Rigby never got in to college u. But You Did. What? Wait, what? Oh, wait. Mordecai, you didn't know that? Rigby, what is he talking about? I don't know. He's crazy. Oh, am I? Am I craze-o, rigby? Then why don't you read the "acceptance letter" you've been carrying around? No! I don't have to! Aaah! Read the letter. Do it, rigby. "From the admittance office of college university." "Dear, rigby, we regret to inform you" that you have not been accepted into this fall's freshman class "at college university." Keep reading! "Though college university is a massive school" and it was a record year for how little applications we received, the admissions committee simply could not find any reason to include you in our enrolling class. The deans were obliged to select among candidates who clearly could do the minimum work required at c.U. We hope you can understand our situation, if you can understand this letter at all. But rest assured that we did not make this unanimous decision on a whim, and as a result, we are not able to consider any appeals to this decision, so don't even try. Though our school motto is 'the college for everyone', sometimes college Isn't For everyone. We thank you for your interest in c.U., but, again, to reiterate, we won't be seeing you anytime soon... or ever. "Sincerely, the admissions board at college university." You've been lying to me all this time? Huh, ouch. But don't worry. The sting of that lie won't last much longer. What? Time for the next phase of my "get revenge on rigby" plan... get rid of his best friend. Set me up, me. No! Ha! Aah! Aaah! Ohhh! Come on! Whatever! As soon as I get back up into space, I'm gonna erase all of time and blow up the earth anyways. Hey, rigby, remember when you ruined my state championship game? Now we're even. Oooohhhh! This is what you losers sound like, and nobody likes it. Oooohhhh! Mordecai? I can't believe you, rigby. All this time you were lying to me? And what, so you forged my rejection letter, is that it? Yeah, but... ugh! Why would you do that? I had to. You would have gone off to college without me. You don't get it, do you? It was just one lie. I was just trying to... it's always just one thing with you. You don't do that to your best friend. Ugh! You're. You're the reason I'm stuck in this dead-end job! Well, I'm stuck, too. Who better to be stuck with than your friend? You're not my friend. All you've ever done is hold me back, and I'm the idiot for not seeing it until now. ♪ Linger on, your pale blue eyes ♪ Rigby, no! Wait! Stop! Come on. Put me down. Put me down. It was all a waste, Mordecai. I sold us out. I climbed the evil corporate ladder, I had an evil six-figure salary, and even bought an evil condo in Maui... right on the beach. Ugh, and for what? No family, no friends. Work isn't everything. It's not worth shooting your best friend over, I'll tell you that. Truth is. Right now, I'd trade in my life for an afternoon playing video games with my bro. The future is in your hands. Ohhhhhh. No! Dude, did we just die, dude? Yeah, dude. Dude, let's get out of here! ♪ Your pale blue eyes ♪ ♪ Linger on, your pale blue eyes ♪ Rigby! Stop! ♪ If I could make the world as pure ♪ Fly me into the sun so I won't have to be so sad anymore. Fuel cells critical. No, no, no! Come on, stupid ship! Stupid ship! Auto pilot engaged To nearest refueling station. ♪ I put in front of me ♪ Yah! Ow! Aaah! Aah! Terrific! This is just... Great! Why would rigby do such a thing? I'm gonna kill him! Why don't we just go back in time before rigby took the ship and then... or, better yet, just go back further and try all over again. Because we don't have time or a way to get back now. He's gone. He took the ship. Good. We don't need him. Well, what are we to do now? I don't know. Calling all available ships to Quadrant 3.457 Alpha. The earth's timeline Is in danger. Ross' timenado has already eaten up the entire 22nd century. We will be starting our final Run to stop him in one hour. We don't know how to stop it, But we have to try. Oh, man. We've got to go help. Oh, good. You're awake. What happened? Emotions, feelings happened. And then you slipped and hit your head. Not your finest hour. Want to see my finest hour? It's around here somewhere. Aah! Sorry. Who are you? I am father time. You don't look so hot. I don't feel so hot. But I guess that's to be expected considering there's a craze-o guy trying to destroy all of time. Why are you saying "craze-o," too? It's "crazy." In the future, it's "craze-o." I'm just being era-appropriate. But anyways, how about you? How are you doing? Bad. I messed up, and everybody hates my guts now. They're better off without me anyway... wherever they are. Well, that's one way to look at it. While you were out, your friends have been busy. They joined gene and the intergalactic park rangers. They're engaged in an epic space battle with that science teacher of yours. It's weird, really. They don't stand a chance. Guess I'll never understand humanity. Why are you showing me all this? I blew it. I lost Mordecai. Mordecai, huh? You're not friends anymore? Told me so himself. Yeah, that's rough. But I'm sure you did all you could to save your friendship, too. Uh, yeah, I did a bunch of stuff. I wallowed in self-pity. I flew off in a rush. Whoa, you Did Do a lot. I know. There's literally nothing else I could do. If only there was a word out there you could say to him. A word that shows him that you feel bad. Maybe in a different language. But when am I gonna have time to learn another language? "Sorry", rigby. The word is "sorry". And if you really want to say it to him, you know where to find him. Aah! I'm not long for this existence, but at least I won't leave here with any regrets. How about you? I got to go say "I'm sorry". I took the liberty of filling your tank up while you were out. That'll be $50,000. What?! I don't have that kind of money! Just kidding. It's on the house. Geez. Can't take a joke? I'm coming, Mordecai. Alert. Alert. We're under attack, sir. It's the galactic park rangers. The rangers? Against my timenado? Ha! Launch more fighters, and let's finish this up. I've got nine seasons of "everybody loves Raymond" to watch. Yes, sir. I hope you enjoy season 4, sir. Mordecai, you all set? Yeah, payload secure, but I'm gonna need help to get to that docking bay. Clear a path for Mordecai, and stay away from those timelines. There's no telling where you'll end up. Techmo, bogies on your six. Huh? Aah! Get going, Mordecai. Computer, find Mordecai. Searching, searching... Mordecai found. Target in sight. Preparing for docking procedure. Mordecai! Aaaah! So... Mordecai! Huh? Mordecai! Huh? Aaaah! What are you doing here, rigby? Haven't you ruined enough timelines for one day? I have to apologize to Mordecai. Aah! Aah! We'll cover you. Now go! Huh? What is this? He-he-he-he. You're funny. My name's Mordecai. I'm rigby. Ohhhhh! Ohhhhh! Whoa! What happened to you, man? How could you work for him? I couldn't stay at the park forever. I had to think of my career. How about your friends? We're not friends. We haven't been friends for a long time. Aaah! Mordecai! Mordecai! Whoa! Mordecai. Listen, Mordecai. I just need to... now's not the best time. You guys, we got to stop running into each other like this. Step aside, Ross. Yeah, it's time to finish this. I'll be finished when time is erased and you two are dead! Aah! Aah! Stay with the plutonium. Aah! Mordecai! Aahhhhh! You were the worst teacher. Stuff it. Aah! Yoo-hoo. Rigby! Show yourself. Ohh! Ohh! Aahhhh! Aahhh! No! Whoa. Whoa! Oof! Mordecai! I've been waiting a long time for this. I'm sorry for ruining your dumb volleyball game, okay? Just let it go, man. Let it go?! Do you know what it feels like to dedicate your life to something and then have it ruined?! Yes, I do. But I'm gonna work hard to make it right. Mordecai, now! Huh? Aah! Thanks. You guys all right? Yeah. Whoa. Is he gonna regenerate? No, the fall must have broken his neck collar. Let's do what we came here to do. Wait. I need to say something. Mordecai, this is all my fault. If I hadn't changed the letter, you wouldn't have wanted to go back in time, and the timenado would never have been created. Well, I think Mr. Ross had it out for you, anyways. It doesn't matter. I robbed you of your future because I was being selfish. You're the only friend I've ever had, and I couldn't stand the thought of losing you. I held you back and ruined your life, and I'm sorry. Dude, you didn't ruin my life. What you did was messed up, but I think before, I was putting too much blame on you for how things have turned out. I've made plenty of mistakes on my own for sure, and if you didn't do what you did, maybe things would have been different, but I'd take working a lame job at a park with my best friend any day. Hm. Mm-hm. Hm. Hm. Hm-hm. Hm. Hm-hm, hm-hm, hm-hm, hm! Now get out of here. I'm gonna take care of this on my own. Rigby, no! You don't have a protective suit! You'll die! I'm tired of you always fixing my problems. This time, I'm Going to fix it. No! Come on. We got to go. Hey, Mordecai. One more thing. Saving the world is the best thing I've ever done. So if you could get Benson to make a sweet bronze statue of me to put at the front of the park, that'd be really cool. No! We have to leave him! Mordecai, it's too late! No, it's not! Rigby! Mordecai, what are you doing? I can't let you do this by yourself. Plus, I want to be a part of that statue, too. The game's not over yet, boys. Now, who's ready to die?! Raaaaah! No! Rigby, catch! Aahhhh! - What the... - Hyah! - Ha. You missed. - Did I? Uh, yeah, you did. What? Set me up, Mordecai. Noooooooo! Aahhh! Oof. Aahhhh! Oof. Aahhhh! Oof. Aahhhh! This hurts way more than I thought it would! Come on. Let's finish this. Yes, sad news. An explosion at west Anderson high has left the entire science department destroyed. Let's go to our aerial coverage up in chopper 6. Frank? I tell you, Jim. It's pretty crazy down there. I've never seen anything like this. Wh-o-o-o-oa. Margaret, stay back, sweetie. So you're telling me, you tried to build a time machine using Mr. Ross' plutonium and blew up the whole science lab?! - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay, I can exp... ow! You're going to jail, Ross. And you two... I'm calling your parents. You two are expelled. Wait. Before you go, I have something to say to Mr. Ross. I'm sorry for ruining your state championship game, Mr. Ross. I know it meant a lot to you, and if it wasn't for me, you guys totally could have won. I'm sorry. That's all I've been waiting to hear. Hoo, man. I feel so much better now. You know, I was about to plan a crazy, complicated revenge plan on you, but now I don't feel like doing that at all. Ha! Now I feel like we can be best friends. You guys want to go get burgers? My treat. What do you say, principal Dean? Can we get burgers? No! You're going to jail! Oh, yeah. Now march! Ow. Wow! Ow! Ha! Ow. Oh, man, come on. I said march! Even though they were really cool, I hope we never turn out like them. I promise I'll never shoot you with a laser. I promise I'll never laser you, either. - Whoa. - Whoa. Well... I guess that wraps a neat, little bow around everything. Mordecai, rigby. A new day, a new beginning. Now, you're a little late, but we can work on tha... Mordecai and rigby! Okay. That'll be $3.95? Uh, sorry. How much? $3.95. Oh, okay. Here you go. Could you just throw the food up here? We're in kind of a hurry. Thanks. Dude, this was a bad idea. We're late. Pbht! We're not late. We're never gonna be late again.
