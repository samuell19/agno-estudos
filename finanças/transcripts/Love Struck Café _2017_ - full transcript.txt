You have a wonderful dayyourself. Bye-bye. [sighing] Hey, Megan. Hey, Chloe. Mr. St. Clairwants to see you. Really? That's what his assistant said. Now? I'm a mess. I think nowwould be good. Megan... you look amazing. Thank you. She's right,you know. You do look amazing. Philip. Hi! What are youdoing here? I had a deposition in the buildingacross the street. Oh... Carly, I coulduse some coffee. Sure. Thanks, Chloe. So...good surprise? Uh, of course, yeah. But right nowI have to go. Mr. St. Clair wants to see me. Do you thinkthat's a good thing? Why wouldn't it be? You are the queenof customer relations. Client relations. Right. I was actually hopingwe could talk. Talk? Yeah.About us? The where-are-we-goingconversation. Part...five. Yes, of coursewe can talk, but right now,I really have to go. Um, what about dinner? What aboutChameleons at 7:00? Perfect. Wish me luck. Luck. [knocking]Mr. St. Clair? Ms. Quinn, come in. How can I help you? Please, have a seat. I have heardnothing but good things about your performancein Client Relations. Thank you. That's whyI wanted to see you. I've read your resume, and I see you've studiedarchitecture at Duke. Yes, I've wantedto design things ever since I was a little girl. Hmm, and yet you're stillin client relations. Well, I'm just waitingon my door to open. Why don't we seeif we can kick that door down? I don't follow. Well, due toa scheduling change, the Sapphire Lake projectis now slated to break ground in less than 30 days. Sapphire Lake? Oh, yes, of course,you wouldn't know about it. We are getting ready to builda new retail development at Sapphire Lake. However, I find myselfin a dilemma, thanks toa 60-something-year-old woman who refusesto sell us her property, land that is smack-dab in the centerof our new development. Now, I need someonewith people skills, Ms. Quinn, and that's whereyou come in. My assistant hasmentioned to me that you grew upnear Sapphire Lake? Yes. I've spenta lot of time there. It's one of my favorite places. Good. Come with me. Watch this. [video]: Welcome to Sapphire Lake, Stoneland Properties' newest luxury housing and retail space, relaxing small-town living meets the convenience... [man's voice]: I sure hope Mrs. Figgins never cuts down our tree. Maybe you shouldcheck the knothole. If I do, will youstop acting so weird? Maybe. [chuckles] Hey, you know I kept all those notes and lettersyou sent me, right? Megan, wait. Joe, do you want me to checkin the knothole or not? Yes. But first... Megan, we've known each otherour whole lives, from preschoolto high school graduation, but I don't want to talkabout the past. I want to talkabout the future. [voice echoes] The future. [video]: ...making waking up tomorrow better today. Voilà! Wow. I hardly recognize it. Impressive, isn't it? Yes, it is. Stick with me on this, Quinn. Mr. St. Clair, I'm not certain Sapphire Lakeis the best place for a development like that. Well, according toour market research, it is. However this woman,Frances Figgins, is holding upthe whole project. We need her parcel of land,and she refuses to sell. She's really the last obstaclein our way, and despite my best effortsto reason with her, she has now hung up on me-- now, let me think...six times? Seven times, sir. Seven times. I'm not sure if you've beento Sapphire Lake, but it really is a very tranquiland, and-- Let me stop youright there, Ms. Quinn. Would you like to getout of client relations and one day design a Stoneland Propertiesdevelopment? Of course. Then you needto learn that sentimentalityand business don't mix. Now, Sapphire Lakeis going to be our biggest development to date, and our CEO wants to make surethat everything goes smoothly. The very futureof this division depends on it. Now, it's been broughtto my attention that you are quitea people person, which is why I thinkyou're the best person to help usclose this deal. So, are you in? I'm in. Good.I'm counting on you. Is my car ready? Waitingfor you, sir. Wonderful. Now, you have to getMrs. Figgins to agree to sell before we're forced to paythe contractors a penalty. If that happens, the board of directorswill pull the plug, and let me assure you,Ms. Quinn, that will notbe a good thing. Not for any of us. Now, you've got till Monday at 10:00 a.m. to close the deal. You do that,and I'll personally see to it that you get a shotat your dream. I'm sorry, did you say, uh,Monday morning? As in four days from now? That's right. We're all counting on you. Don't let us down. [♪♪] So, I guess youhaven't seen it? Seen what? The latest editionof Chicago Attorney. [chuckles] No, I haven't. I dog-eared the page. "Meet Chicago's ten fastest risinglegal stars..." "Number seven... Philip Allen Carter." Wow, Philip, this is amazing. I love that they usedmy full name. Wow, I am so proud of you. Thank you. I actually had someonerecognize me at lunch today. It was... surreal. I knew all your hard workand long hours would pay off. Well, you know, I figuredit's not just good for me, it's good for us. [snapping fingers] Wine list? Good for us? Yeah. Now that my career's taking off, I was hoping we could talkabout our future. Oh, okay. Um... you know, Philip, I'm just really focused on this Sapphire Lake thingfor work. Maybe we could wait-- Megan... We've been waiting. We've been dating, what, nine months? I haven't metyour family yet. Why haven't you invited mehome to Cedarville? Vale. It's Cedarvale. We've been working so much, both of us. Is it that, or is that you'rejust not sure about me? No, it is... it's not you. I just, I just need-- "A little more time." Right? That's what you sayevery time I bring this up. Megan... I'm a catch. I know you are. [cell phone rings] Oh. It's the CedarvaleHospital. I need to take this. Sure. Megan Quinn. Hello, Dr. Baker. Is everything okay? Oh. Okay. Thanks for calling. Uh, yes. I can be therefirst thing in the morning. Goodbye,Dr. Baker. What is it? My dad fell off a ladderand fractured his foot. He's spending the nightin the hospital. Well, doesn't soundtoo serious. Right? I can'tmiss my flight if I'm goingto see my dad before I meetwith Mrs. Figgins. So... where does that leave us? I promise I'm going to thinkeverything over. Fine. But remember, the number sevenfastest rising legal star in Chicago is not gonna beon the market for long. I'll think fast. I'll call you. Have a safe trip. Okay, thanks, and congratulations. [♪♪] Dad? Mom? What? Your fatherwanted to surprise you. Surprise me? Honey, I've got some terrific news! You are-- --going to bea Duke Blue Devil! Violet! [applause] Congratulations, honey. -Really?-Yes! I... I thought we couldn't afford it. You got your scholarship. That is,if you still want to go. Still want to go? Of course I do!

[brakes screeching] [sighs] I'm so sorry. I guess I got distracted. Joe? Megan? Well, doesn't look likethere's any damage. You okay? What? Well, you...you ran into me. Are you all right? I... Yes. Since when is therea stop sign here? Since a few months ago. Since when are youback in town? A few monthsbefore the stop sign. I came backto take over the farm after my dad retired. He and Momare traveling the world. So, you don't get homemuch, do you? What's that supposed to mean? Of course I do. I come home all the time. I was just here at Christmas. I talk to my dad,like, every day. I don't know whyI'm explaining myself to you. I'm not sure. Anyway, um,if everything's good here, I'm probably gonna... uh, yeah, I'm gonna go. [chuckling] Megan... How are you? Great. Perfect. I have an amazing job,an amazing apartment, an amazing boyfriend. Basically, my life's... Amazing? Exactly. We're talking aboutgetting engaged. Congratulations. Thanks. And so you're...you're an architect? I, uh, I workin client relations at Stoneland. I'm sure you've heard of us. We're one of the biggestin our field. No, I... I haven't. Anyway, I'm a supervisor. So, you're...you're not an architect. What happened to your dream? I really need to go. I don't know if you heard,my dad's in the hospital. No, I-I did hear that. I actually wentto go see Matt this morning. Great. Well, goodbye. [engine starting] Well, that was fun. It's straight down here,and then a right on Elm Street. Dad! Oh, hey, honey,how you doing? Are you okay? I'm fine. I'll be outta herein no time. Dr. Baker says you were on thatbroken ladder again. You have no businessbeing up there. "No business..." You make me soundlike an old man. Mom would not have allowed it. Megan Quinn? Paging Megan Quinn. Violet! Hey. Oh, I was hopingyou'd be on call. How you feeling, Mr. Q? Bored, Violet. Hmm. Hey, have you beenby the café lately? Yeah, I stopped infor my "to go" coffee. It was pure chaos. Waitresscalled in sick again. I knew it,I knew it! I gotta getback to work. Can you pull some stringsand get me out of here? Hey! I heard that. Oh boy. Gotta run. Meet up later at the café? Yeah, sounds good. And stay away from those oldladders, Mr. Q. I will try. How's my favoritepatient today? Oh, you know, could be better,could be worse. I was speaking to Megan. [chuckles] Aw, hey,Dr. Baker. You are looking moreand more like your mother every time I see you. Well, thank you. I can't thinkof a better compliment. Um, so, is hegoing to be okay? Yeah, he'll be all right. Okay, then,when can I get out of here? I mean, come on,it's Apple Festival Week. It's my big profit time. Apparently, my businessis falling apart. Well, you cango home today if you want. Well, about time. Of course, you needto stay off your feet for a little while, and out of the café. Oh, no, no, no,I can't do that. I've gota business to run. Okay, I guess we cankeep him here a little while longer? Okay, fine, you win. You need to letyour foot heal properly before you returnto work, okay? And if I hear you've beenback in that café too soon, you'll have me to answer to. You understand? [sighing heavily]Yes, I understand. Megan, you make surehe keeps his promise. Will do, Doctor. -Okay.-Thank you. Okay, I've gotto pack up my things. I need to get downto the café as soon as possible. Dad, no, did you hearwhat he just said? [grumbles dismissively]Ah, doctor talk. No, I'm fine. I can do more on one foot than most folkscould do on three. Dad, you can't rush things, or elseit'll make it worse. Well, what do youexpect me to do? Burn the place down? Or... Or you could, uh... you could work with mefor a while. No. No, no, Dad, no, I cannot do that. [sighing] Well... I guess I'll justhave to call Dottie, and... have her shut it down. Okay, I will help out. Are you sureyou can handle it? Dad, I've done every jobpossible at Rosie's. [cell phone rings]How hard can it be? I've justgot to get this. One sec. Megan Quinn. Are you with Mrs. Figgins? Yes. I mean, no. I mean,I'm on my way there right now.-Good. With what we're offering her,she should be begging us, and not the other way around. Now, your job is to convince her that this deal is in her best interest. Oh, and, Ms. Quinn? Yes, Mr. St. Clair? The clock is ticking. Uh... [beeps off] [♪♪] [trowel scraping] Mrs. Figgins? May I help you? Hi. I hope you remember me. It's beena long time. [gasps in delight]Megan Quinn. Oh, my goodness, look at you. Oh, I always knew you'd grow up to bea beautiful woman. Thank you. To what do I owethis pleasure? Well, I was just in townvisiting my dad, and I thoughtI'd stop by and say hi. Oh, yes,that's right. I heard Mattwas in the hospital. Now, how's he doing? Oh, he's fine,thank you. He just fractured his foot. Oh dear, that sounds painful. Please, give him my best. I will. Have you seen Joe? He's backin town, you know. I bumped into him earlier. Once upon a time, you two were liketwo peas in a pod. But I guesstimes change, huh? Yes. Uh, Mrs. Figgins... Oh, please, call me Frances. I mean, you'reall grown up now. I think you can usemy given name. Okay. Frances... [chuckles fondly] Uh, Frances, I hopeyou don't think I'm intruding. I rang the doorbell,but no one came, so-- Oh, listen,it's no intrusion. As a matter of fact,it's a nice diversion. When the doorbell rang, I thought you were one of them. "Them"? Those horrible developers. Did you know thatthere's this company trying to buy up my home and turn it intoa shopping mall? They think they canjust throw money at me, and I'll hand over my propertywithout a thought as to how they intendto use the land. Anyway... Megan, it's so good to see you. I mean, what are you doingthese days? Uh... well, I work at Stoneland Properties. I'm in clientrelations. Um, I know you'vespoken to my boss several times, Jordan St. Clair, but he wanted meto come here and personallytake you through-- Ms. Quinn... We reallyfeel like this development is gonna energizethe local economy and create hundreds ofgreat new jobs for people-- Ms. Quinn. Please, just call me Megan. Ms. Quinn. I am not interested. Listen, I understand if you arereluctant to sell. I mean, look at this place. Reluctantto sell? Actually,it's quite the opposite. I have been planning to sellfor some time. I mean,I'm getting older, and pretty soon this place is gonna becometoo much for me. I had plannedto put my house on the market and move to Florida and live with my daughterand my grandchildren. If I sell to you, I will be responsible for this monstrosityof asphalt and cement that they're proposing. I couldn't live with myself. So, have youseen the plans? Of course I have, and the localplanning commission will never approvethe development as long as I ownthis property. Planning commission? I sent them overa basket of my freshly bakedpumpkin muffins at their last meeting. They said they were delicious. So, it looks like I holdall the cards, Ms. Quinn. Good day. Frances, if I could just-- Please, it's, it's,it's Mrs. Figgins, and this conversation is over. What happened to you? To the girl thatI used to know? You were going to dogreat things. [door closes] [♪♪] [sighs] [Chloe]: How'd it go with Mrs... What's her name? So far, she's not budging. Oh, all you needed... That's not good. No, it's not. Sorry it didn't go well. And to make matters worse,my ex is back in town. Oh, wow. Your ex? Please elaborate. Well, to make a very long story short, his name's Joe. We grew up together, dated all through high school, and then, a week intomy freshman year of college, he sent me a letterbreaking up with me, said we'd grown apart, whatever that means. Then, when I tried to call him, he wouldn't take my calls. That had to sting. So, whatever happened to him? He moved away, met someone, got married, had a baby girl. Actually, his wife passed away. How sad. Yeah. He's been a single dadever since. And just when I thought I'd probably neversee him again, I ran into him today. Literally. I ran into his pickup truck. [chuckles] Ouch. Ah, sweet freedom! Ha ha!Now I can get some real food. Oh, hey, honey! Chloe, I gotta go. I'll call you back. [♪♪] [sighing] Oof. I got you. Aw, thanks, darling. No problem. Lunch is served. Excellent. Um... there's...there's no meat. We're eating healthytoday, Dad. So... how are you feeling? I'm fine. I don't need a babysitter. I know you don't. [cell phone rings] Megan Quinn. So, how did your meetingwith Mrs. Figgins go? It went... really well. Yes, well, I was waiting for an update. Yeah, I was just aboutto call you. The reception'sreally spotty here. You know, small towns. Hmm. So, you'll havegood news for me soon? Yes, I will. We're very close. That's whatI like to hear, Ms. Quinn. You call me as soon as youhave the signed documents. Will do. What was that all about? Can I trust younot to overdo it if I head out for a little bit? Of course. Like I said,I don't need a babysitter. Okay. Are you going to go seeFrances Figgins again? How do you know about that? You know, small town. Call me if you need anything. All right. Oh, before you gosee Frances again, can you stop by Rosie's and make sureeverything's okay? It'll just make me feel better. Sure, Dad. I'll call you. Okay. Hello. Hi. What's your name? My name's Megan.What's your name? Hurry up,slowpoke. Okay, okay. You're too fast for me. Hello. Hello. Again. Do you know her, Daddy? I do. You must be Lily. How do you know my name? I've heard about you. Megan and I knew each otherwhen we were your age. Wow, that's a long time ago. [chuckles] You know, Lily, when your dad and I were little, we used to ride bikes together. -Really?-Mm-hm. Do you want to comebike riding with us? [laughs] Um, I'd love to, but I'm headingover to the café. I'm helping outwhile my dad's laid up. You mean Rosie's café? That's the one. Megan's family owns Rosie's. Um... Well, yeah, we couldhead over there in a bit. Yes! Well, it was nicemeeting you, Lily. Maybe I'll see you later. Okay. Bye, Megan. Bye. Bye. Goodbye. Hey, Dottie. Megan! Oh! Oh, you are a sightfor sore eyes, girl. I've actually got to getto an important meeting, but my dad said to stop by,I told him I would, make sureeverything's okay. Mm, follow me. I actually gottaget going. Our extra waitress for the festival crowddidn't show up, and I am swamped, and I just spoke to Matt,and he said you'd be willingto help out. But I... Wait, you want meto wait tables? That's the general idea. Dottie, I haven'twaited tables in years, and I'm already latefor my meeting. Hmm, well, Matt said thatif you wouldn't do it to give him a call, and he'd be in the next cabdown here to do it himself. [sighing] I'm really sorry. ...just clean that up... [sighs] All right. More coffee, right? And I'll get you guysyour check, and-- [sighs] Hi. Hey. Hi, Megan. Hi, Lily. You're a waitress? Uh, yeah, sort of. Uh, hey, Lily,how would you like to help me? Really? If it's okay with your dad. Can I, Daddy? Please? Uh... Yeah, sure, sweetie,why not? All right,let's get you an apron. Come on. Whoa. [♪♪] Okay, good job. Let's do thesilverware. [Lily]: Okay! Okay... [♪♪] [Lily]: Uh-huh. Napkins... [Lily]: Sure! I think Lily wasborn to wait tables. [chuckles] Seems so. [clears throat] Is, uh... is somethingon your mind, Dottie? You broke her heart, Joe. Just thoughtyou should know that. Okay. Thanks for letting me know. You're welcome. [♪♪] [♪♪] No, no, no, I think I have to havea little bit of this. We need totake that away. How cozy. [knocks] Hi! Hey. Come on. Okay. One second. Whew! I feel likeI just ran a marathon, and that was justthe lunch rush. I'd like to bea Rosie's waitress one day. Yeah? Well, you know, I canput in a good word for you. I kind of knowthe owner. Ooh. Whatcha drawing? I'm trying to draw Violet. Oh. Just make sureyou get my good side. I don't knowhow to draw noses. Oh, well, here, let me show youa little trick. You go like that, and then... boop! You try it. You're a good artist. Well, thank you. You're a good artist. Hey, Megan, some guyjust delivered these. They're for you. Uh... from my boyfriend. He's always doingstuff like this. So, Megan, tell us all about the mysterious manin your life. He's not mysterious. Well, Ihaven't met him, and I'm your best friend. He's just busy. [Joe]: I've heardall about him. His name is Philip, and he's a big-time attorney. Yeah. We met at a party. What's he like? Violet, I've told youabout Philip before. I know, but I'm sureJoe wants to hear. Yeah, I wanna hear. What's he like? Uh, okay, well,he's a really nice guy, and he is really... neat. Not like a neat-freak "neat," but just, like, neat. And he is, uh, a really healthy eater. He juices, um, and he's anexpert polo player, and he playsa lot of racquetball-- When he's not busy juicing. [sighs] Well, read the card. "Megan, all that you areis all that I'll ever need. Love, Your Man in Waiting." That's deep. Shakespeare? I think it's a 1990sR & B song. Well, it's romantic, if not original. Thank you. It's quitethe extravagant bouquet. He must really miss you. What's that supposed to mean? It's just an observation. -Huh.-Here you go. Wait. Rodrigo,what's this? Shopping list. Yeah, Matt handlesall the shopping for the café, along with the repairs,inventory, invoices,supplies, payroll. The usual. But I...I can't do all that. I don't actually work here. Well, I talked to Matt, and he said you're in chargetill he gets back, so... But... Hey, don't worry.You'll do fine. We have a little problemin the kitchen, boss. A little problem? What happened? Dishwasher goes on the fritzabout once a month. Matt refusesto get a new one. Well, this isunacceptable, but I reallydon't have time to deal with thisright now. We need to clear something up. I have a job, and I am undera lot of pressure to do that job, and I didn't come hereto play waitress, or fix dishwashers,or fill shopping lists, so I quit! [Violet]: Well said. Mmm. [sighs] [dishwasher clunks] Okay... I don't quit... yet. But what am I supposedto do with this? I'll take a look. No, thank you. We got it. Dottie, who handlesthis sort of thing? Well, Matt does, and when he can'thandle it, he calls Joe. [Rodrigo]: Dottie,you got customers. Hold your horses. Whatever you do,please do it fast. I should probably... Please? Yeah. Thank you. Let's go finishour coffee. Joe Wainwright, you always couldfix everything. [sighs] Most things. Good. Because I'mat an impasse. I have until Monday morning to convince...a certain someone to sell her property, and she doesn't want to budge, because she doesn't likethe plans. I'm sorry, that's justnot my area, but I'm sureyou'll figure it out. Great. Thanks. So, do you thinkthe dishwasher will stay fixed? Yeah, witha little TLC, she'll pull through. Why do you thinkit's a "she"? Your dad calls her Flo. Flo? Clever. So, uh, what do I owe you? Um... It's no charge. Dad! I beat Rodrigoin Go Fish! What? That's impressive. I don't beat Rodrigoat anything. It's easy. Can we go home now? I need to get readyfor the hayride. Sure. Are you comingto the hayride later? Um... It's the Apple Festival, at the Community Center? Remember? There's the hayride, bobbing for apples,and candy apples. It's so much fun! You know what,it's been a really long day, but maybe another time. Okay. All right, tell Meganyou say goodbye. Bye, Megan. Goodbye, Lily. Thanks again. Of course. All right, let's getthat seatbelt on, kiddo. Okay, Dad. Mrs. Figgins? Hello, this is Megan Quinn...again. Uh, listen, I don't meanto be a pest, but I was wondering if, um, if you haven't eaten, maybe I could bring yousome dinner. Yes, I realize it's after 6:00. No, I didn't realizeyou eat at 5:00. Uh, well, maybe I could bring yousome breakfast in the-- [click, dial tone] Hello? [sighs] I am so fired. Dinner is served. [cell phone rings] [dismisses call] [sighs] You do realizeI'm not a vegetarian, right? Dad, as long asI'm taking care of you, you're going to eathealthy food. Hmm. Can I at least havesome ice cream after dinner? We'll see. Hmm. [Matt sighs] [Megan sighs] So... is there anything goodon TV tonight? You're not going out? I've had a really hard day. I just want to sit hereand not think. So no hayrides? No. Hmm. What's with that look? Well, Joe's going to be there. So? Well, he's really closewith Frances Figgins. As a matter of fact, Joe's over there all the timedoing things for her. I mean, she thinksJoe Wainwright hung the moon. [♪♪] [laughter] It's getting cool out here. Let's zip you up. Hi, guys. Megan! I'm so gladyou came! Me too. Hey. Hi. I got a second wind. I mean, plus, who doesn't lovea good hayride, right? Yeah. All right, well,let's get on board. All right. Here we go! [engine starts] [Joe]: Hold on tight! Whoa. [Joe laughs] All right! [♪♪] [laughing] Sorry. Dad, we want to gobobbing for apples! Okay, have fun. Okay. Stay together. All right, Dad! That was fun, the hayride? Yeah, it was. Hey, can Iask you a favor? Depends. I was just wonderingif you'd come with me to go seeMrs. Figgins tomorrow. Why's that? I just thoughtit'd be fun to visit here whileI'm here, you know? Like we used towhen we were kids. Rumor has it you've alreadybeen over to see her. Wait, how did you...? Oh, right... [together]: Small towns. Listen, she justreally likes you, and she won't take my calls. Why won't shetake your calls? My company purchaseda few hundred acres around Sapphire Lake for a new retaildevelopment. We can't break ground because we needMrs. Figgins' land, and she refusesto sell to us. Without her property,the deal is dead. Your "certain someone?" Yeah. So you want me to help you force a poor old ladyout of her home? What? No.Of course not. No one's forcing anyone. She wants to sellso she can move to Florida. She just doesn't wantto sell to us, because she doesn't likethe plans. If I can pull this off, I might finally getto realize my dream. I might actuallyget to be an architect, and... Frances is goingto end up selling to someone. Besides, it'll bringhundreds of jobs to Cedarvale. This is a good thing.Will you please help me? [Lily]: Dad! Mom's apple cake. We have to make it! "Apple Sampler"? What's that? It's something that startedafter you moved away. A lot of people intown get together, make their favoriteapple dessert so the visitors to the Festival can taste the bestCedarvale has to offer. Proceeds go to the hospital. Momma's apple cakewas amazing. Let's make that! [sighing] Lilypad, I... I don't even knowif I have the recipe. She was the master baker. I don't knowif I'll do it justice. We have to make something, Maybe I could... help. My mom wasa great baker. Please, Dad? Okay, all right. I'll do it. We shouldbake something. I can help youmake an apple pie. Yeah! How hard couldthat be, right? All right, let's go. [chuckling] Thanks for comingon the hayride with us. Thanks for inviting me. I had a lot of fun. Megan... I'll come with you. You know, Lily's goingto a friend's house tomorrow during the day, so... why don't you come bythe farm around noon? That'd be great. Thanks. No problem. Bye, guys. Let's go. [♪♪] [honks horn] Hey. Hey. I really appreciateyou doing this. No problem. But I'm not gonna be part of your littlebusiness deal, okay? I'm just coming alongfor the ride. Okay. Okay. You realize you droveright past the Figgins house. I know. Just for a minute. I wanted to see this. Wow, I'd forgottenhow beautiful it is. You used to say this was your favoriteplace on Earth. Remember? You have a really good memory. For things that areworth remembering. I wanna talk about the future... our future. Megan, I'm readyto take things to the-- [cell phone rings] Um... hello? Now? Okay, I'll be right there. That was my dad. I need to get backto the café right away. Did he say why? No. He just says that I need to get thereas soon as possible. We should go, then. Okay, let's go. [♪♪] I'm gonna checkthe knothole, just in case. Nothing. [chuckles] I kept your letter. I wanted to remember. [sighs] Remember what I had,what I lost. You know, you never reallygave me an explanation for why you broke up with me. It was a long time ago. Does that mean you're stillnot going to tell me? Joe! Hi! Hi! I was just aboutto sit down for lunch. You care to join me? Yeah, sure. Your friend can come too, if she likes. Look at that. Off to a good start. Oh boy. Very cleverof you, Ms. Quinn, to bring Joe alongwith you this time. You obviously knowhow much I adore him. Mrs. Figgins, you knowyou can call me Megan. I mean, after all, I am stillthe same little girl that used to come and visit you. All right, Megan, and I supposeyou can call me Frances. But I would appreciate it if you waituntil we finish lunch before you try and stealmy house out from under me. I'm teasing you. [laughing] Mark Twain said humor is one of mankind'sgreatest blessings. So, Joe, how's Lily? Oh, she's...she's great. She's growinglike a beanstalk. Aw, well, you tell her that I want to see her soon. I will. I still have oneof your drawings, you know. Really? Mm-hm. You were quite good. You drew a pictureof my house once, do you remember that? Yes. Do you still draw? Not really. Oh, that's too bad. I remember you weregoing to be an architect. [Joe's cell phone rings] Oh. I'm so sorry,I have to get this. A guy wants to buysome hay. Hello? I hear you havesome hungry horses. Frances, what would it take to convince youto make a deal with us? [sighs heavily] I see, we're back to business. I still have a job to do. I told you, I'm willing to sellto the right buyer, someone who cares about my lake, and it's obviouswhoever drew up those plans has no connection whatsoeverto this land. I suspect the designernever once gazed acrossthis majestic lake at sunset, or watched the shadows fall, had never seen the geeseappear on the horizon in a perfect V, and descend downacross the treetops, and land gentlyon the water. Never watcheda mother deer and her fawn grazing by the shore, or heard the frogscroaking at night. Brick and asphalt? Fast foodand discount stores? That is notmy idea of paradise. Uh, sorry, ladies, I hate to cut this short,but I have to meet this guy. Very well. I understand. Frances, thank youso much for lunch. Thanks so much,Frances. It's my pleasure. Frances... would you mindif I came to see you again? Oh, please do. But that doesn't mean thatI'm gonna sell to your company. Well, you can't blame mefor trying. Goodbye. Sorry to leave you alone. We're extra busy. Oh, that's fine. You know, you're actuallya pretty good waitress. Thanks. You know,the more I'm here, the more it allcomes back to me. The memories... Hanging out here with you and my mom when I was little. We used to sitin that booth right over there, and she'd help mewith my homework. She taught me to bake here... Remember? [laughing] [sighs] She showed me which sideto serve from, and made sure I never leta customer's coffee cup get below half full. She taught meto be nice to people. And I realize now they aren't just skillsfor the café, but they're skills for life. You know? Rosie's wasmy mother's dream. She may have died too young, but at least she gotto live her dream. I envy that. Why? Because I... I feel like my dreams are right there in front of mefor the taking, and yet they're somehowjust out of reach. Maybe it's the fact that our dreamsare hard to reach that makes themworth reaching for. [cell phone rings] It's Joe. Joe? Hey there. Hi. Uh, we've got a little problem. Okay... What's a little problem? Well... Lily and Ibaked an apple... pie... At least, I think it was a pie. Um... and we were ready to bring it to the Festival, but I thought the pie had to cool... and the goat jumped the fenceand ate the pie. Oh! Poor Lily. More like poor goat. Look, I promised them 12 bales of hay by 5:00 p.m. and Lily promised thema pie by 6:00, so... help? Well, I'm at the café. Bring Lily, bring the apples,uh, you deliver your hay. [sighing in relief] You are a savior. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. Bye. A goat ate the pie. It happens. [chuckling] Hey. You know what, Lily? My mother used to makethe most delicious apple cake. Your mom? Rosie? Yeah. Maybe we should make that? You and me? Yeah! Yeah, okay. Come here,let's get you an apron. Okay. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye, Dad. Goodbye. Have fun, girls. [Megan]:My mom always said thatthe first ingredient is love, when baking. The trick is, don't squeeze the eggs. You want to pull them apart,just like that. All right,Wainwright apples, going in. I'm gonna let youstir it all up. Good. You want to stir it?-Okay. [♪♪] It's hard work, right? [laughing] [chuckles] So the Festival folksliked the cake? It was hard to tell. We put it on display, someone came over,took a bite, next thing we know,it was gone in five minutes. So Lily was pleased. Yes. Yes, she was very pleased. Good. What's wrong? It's just,Lily is bonding with you, and it's great... but you're not goingto be here long, you know? Well, I can keep in touch. It's not the same. I appreciate the offer. You are so muchlike your mother. Thank you. That's a wonderful compliment. She was a wonderful person. You just care so muchabout other people. So do you. You know, my mother alwaysthought of you as the son she never had. How serious are you? About...? Mr. Polo player. Uh, Philip. Um... Well, he'sa really great guy. He's very ambitious. He's probably going to runfor office someday. You didn't answer my question. He's really good to me. Still didn't answermy question. He's... I'm... Look, it'sgetting late. Yeah, sure. Thanksfor the baking help. Anytime. [cell phone vibrates] Cedarvale. [♪♪] [Lily]:Let's go! Come on! This way! Say hi tothe family, okay? Hey. Hi. [Dr. Baker]: Could I haveyour attention, please? You ready? Folks, thank you so much for making this year'sApple Sampler the best ever. [applause] And for those of you who contributed to our hospital, you are trulythe heartbeat of Cedarvale. [applause]-I mean... And now, for this year'sPeople's Choice for Best Dessert, the award goes to... The Wainwright family. [applause and cheers] Oh, my gosh! Yeah! -What?-We did it. Thank you, Megan. I think your motherwould be so proud of you. Thanks. I think so too. Come on,let's go tell Rodrigo! Okay, all right,all right. Hey... wanna come? You go. It's a Wainwright moment. I play golf every Sunday,Ms. Quinn. It relaxes me. But today, I'm not relaxed. Now, why do you think that is? Well, you said it rained... That's the least of it, Ms. Quinn. Try again. You're worried aboutthe Sapphire Lake project? Exactly. Now, I got in six holes, and I was five over par. I'm a scratch golfer,Ms. Quinn, so life is not good. Well, at leastnow you can relax and go back to enjoyingthe rest of your Sunday. I'm back at my office. Who relaxes at work? You do remember work, Ms. Quinn? Now, tell me, what is happening with this Mrs. Figgins? Uh, she's beinga little difficult. Well, that's why I gave you this job. You're supposed to be able to handle difficult, help her overcome her reservations and get the deal done. Now, you do your job, or else you'll be lookingfor a new one. [beeping] [muttering] Great. Oh... Hey, Matt! Hey! Good morning! Dad, what are you doing here? Well, I got tiredof sitting around the house, so I thought I'd justcome by and, uh... do a little cleaning? Don't worry,I'm not gonna overdo it. [chuckling] Look at you. Oh, your mother'd begrinning from ear to ear. Hey, Matt,how you feelin'? Like a manwith a busted foot. Well, you're backin the nick of time, boss. Megan here was just about to runthis place into the ground. Oh, stop it,she did just fine. So it seems. Well, welcome back.I gotta go. Where are you going?I just got here. I have a meetingto go to. I'll see you later. A meeting? On Sunday? This one's perfect. Dad and I are goingto make applesauce. Just don't letthe goats know, okay? [chuckles] I thought you weresupposed to leave by noon. Yeah. I'm headed out to see Francesagain this afternoon. I have no choice. If I can't get her to signby tomorrow morning, I'm out of a job. Well... You want me to come with you? No. I just... Anyway, I gotta get going. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. See ya. Megan, hey... I know whenyou're not okay. I always have. Talk to me. [sighs heavily] Am I doingthe right thing, with Frances? I mean,I'm not sure anymore. Why aren't you sure? Because it doesn't feel right. When I was little,Frances was so kind to me. She encouraged me,and believed in me. And now allI can think about is getting herto do what I want so I can getsome promotion and advance my career. Is that wrong? You know... I think,sometimes in life, we put on blinders, and we think there's onlytwo solutions to a problem. What do you mean? Well, look,you think that Frances eithersells you the property or she says no,and the project's dead. Yeah, that pretty muchsums it up. Well, what if there wasanother option? A third option? Yeah. What? Well, I don't know. But... what I've found isthat when you admit there could beanother solution, one ends up showing up. Bye, Lily. Bye, Megan. See you later. For Frances. She loves apples. Good luck! Thanks. So, Megan's going home soon, huh, Dad? That's right. Are you going to miss her? A little. I miss Mommy, even though I was little. Sometimes I wishI could tell her that. So... if you're going to miss Megan, I think you should tell her, or she'll never know. [chuckles] You know what, I thinkyou're right. We're done apple picking. All right?-Okay. [♪♪] I love this view. That drawing you oncemade of my house? I still have it, framed,near my mantle. Oh, wow,I'm flattered. Ah, you were alwaystalented, Megan. Always. Oh, it's stillso beautiful, isn't it? The reflection of leaveson the water? Yeah, it is. I used to loveto come down here as a girl and skip stones. Oh, me too. Joe and Iused to do that. Joe's a good man. Yeah, he is. We all thought you were destinedfor one another, the whole town. Well, Ithought so too, but then he... broke up with me, just like that. Ah yes,the "Dear Megan" letter. Joe told me about it. He came out to my housethe day he mailed it. Oh, he waspractically inconsolable. Inconsolable? He... he wrote me and told me he didn'twant to see me anymore. Your Joe was just a young man, but he was smart enough to know that he had to let you goand chase your dreams, and he was so afraidthat you'd resent him, so he tolda little white lie to make it easier for you. But I was justgoing off to college. We could have found a wayto make it work. Joe wanted to give youyour freedom, so he made a choice. Now, maybe you could havemade it work, and maybe not. And now it's too late. You have a special placein Joe's heart, Megan, and no matter what happensfrom this point forward, you always will. A first loveis a forever love. Well, I had a lovely time. Me too. Frances... can I ask you a question? You want to knowwhat it's going to take to convince me to sell my houseto your company. Look around you. What do you see? Beauty. Peace. It really is a special place. Yes, and the plan that yourcompany has presented doesn't respect the beautyof this special place. Now, if you cancome up with a way to keep the beautyof this lake alive, then maybe we can do business. But how? The plans are set. they have been for months. Put your heart into it. Goodbye. Bye. [cell phone vibrates] Hello? Megan, you need to come right away. Yeah, Flo'sbeen acting up again, and your dad's not around. Flo? The dishwasher! All right, I'll be right there. And maybe you should call Joe. Okay. Hey, Dottie, is it bad? Did you call Joe? No need to. Joe? Hey, Megs. Um... Megan... [clearing throat] we've known each othera long time... and when I saw youthe other day, when you bumped into mein the street, I needed to tell you that I felt something. Mmm. ...and it made me realize that the feelingsI've had for you a long time ago have never gone away. Megan... I don't want to lose you again. And... [door opens]Megan? Philip? I was hopingyou'd be here. What are you doing here? I couldn't stand itany longer. I had to see you. Megan, honey, I don't know whatthe future holds for us, but I think we shouldchoose each other, and just figure it outas we go. So... Megan Anne Quinn... will you be my wife? Uh... Megan... I-I'm sorry. Congratulations. Joe, wait! Philip, please stand up. I'll be back. Megan! Who's Joe? Joe, wait a second. Wait! You broke upwith me, remember? You wrote me a letter,and that was it. No explanation, and poof, and you weregone from my life. [sighs in exasperation] I thought we werebest friends, Joe. I thought we were goingto build a life together. I didn't want to standin the way of your dream. So you made a choice for me without even talking about it? I know why you did it, Joe. Frances told me. But you were wrong. We could havemade it work. We could have made it workbecause I loved you, and I know you loved me-- Okay,all right. Go back inside, okay? Philip's waiting. Don't do this again. Don't push me away. We're living twodifferent lives, Megan. Your life is back in Chicagowith Philip. My life ishere with Lily. I guess I... I thought we couldget back what we once had. I don't knowwhat I was thinking. [car door opens] [Megan]:Joe... Megan? Philip, we need to talk. All right, thanks!Come again! [man calls]:Thanks, Matt! [chuckling]:Yeah. See ya. Always a pleasure. Let me know when youget back to Chicago. You're a great guy. Ah. Seemed like a nice enough fella. [sighs heavily] We broke up. Well, good. Then I don't have to payfor the wedding. [chuckles] Come on, I'm kidding. You wanna talk about it? No, thank you. Dad, if you don'tneed me here, I think I'd like to go home. I need to start workingon my résumé. Sure, I thinkwe can manage somehow. Ooh, before you go, I was in the back officecleaning this morning, and I found this. What is it? Have a look. Huh? Remember those? No, your mother was planningon making a new menu, and she wanted to useone of your drawings as the cover. Of course, she died before she could putthe plan into motion. Yeah, she was alwaysyour biggest fan. [♪♪] The third option! Dad, thank you! Oh, you're the best. Uh, don't mention it... I guess. The third what? [♪♪] [rain pouring] [♪♪] [birds tweeting] [muffled cell phone ringing] Hello? [whispering] Megan! I've been tryingto reach you all morning. Do you know what today is? No, what? Today's Monday,which means deadline day? Oh, no. Shoot! My deadline. It's less than an hour away. Why do you think I've beentrying to reach you all morning? Mr. St. Clair's on his way to Cedarvale right now, and he's not happy. Oh, no.Okay, okay, I'm on it. Uh, I'll call you later. [beeping off] I'm heading out, Dad! Good luck! So, if you'll just signat the bottom... And what if I don'tsign, Mr. St. Clair? Mrs. Figgins...may I call you Frances? No. Mrs. Figgins, Stoneland Properties ownsall of the surrounding land, so there will be no more buyers. Now, if you continueto hold out, well, we'll be forcedto break ground on the portion of landthat we do own, and, unfortunately, it will getpretty noisy around here, and this is a sweetheartof a deal, Mrs. Figgins. But if we're forcedto delay much longer, it might notbe so sweet. Now, this really isthe only option. [car honks] Wait! Don't sign anything. Don't signanything. Ms. Quinn? What do you think you're doing? Just bear with me, please. Bear with you? No. No, you had your chance,and you missed your deadline. That's why I'm here. No,not yet. I still have... four minutes. No, Ms. Quinn, you no longer havenegotiating authority on this project. Now, a deal is on the table. On the table,perhaps, but the penis still in my hand. I want to hear what Meganhas come up with. Mrs. Figgins,the plans are all set. We're getting readyto break ground. It's really too latefor any changes. Excuse me,Mr. St. Clair, but Mrs. Figgins' property sits dead center of the proposeddevelopment. Without her land, there's no waythe local planning commission will ever approve the project, and if she'snot budging, we don'thave a choice but to look atother options. Not budging? She was about to signbefore you got here. Well, now I've hada sudden change of heart. I want to hearwhat Megan has come up with. This better be good. Okay. Last night, I was thinkingthis whole thing over, and I realizedthat Frances is not being at all unreasonable. Of course not. All she wantsis to ensure that this stunninglybeautiful place, where she's spenther entire life, remains that way, and I think thatwith a little creativity, we can both get what we want. We can builda profitable development that respects the environment. Interesting. No, no, no, no, no,this is far too much green. Are these trails? These treesare all supposed to be removed. But theydon't have to be. I've adjusted the footprintof the development, but the square footageremains exactly the same. I've arranged the restaurants so they getthe best views of the lake, and I sketched ingreen footpaths from the parking structureto the retail area, and I put ina playscape for kids by the water. I think we can makethis development a place where customerswant to linger, and if we can do that, they'll wantto come back, and in the long run, if we create a space that peoplewant to return to again and again, that means bigger profits. I'm really proud of you. You have done a beautiful job. Just to be clear, Mrs. Figgins, you're saying that if we go with this plan, you might consentto selling your property? Yes. I could bepersuaded. I'm not against development,Mr. St. Clair. It just has to bethe right kind. Okay, Ms. Quinn. Get these plans onthe drawing board. We'll see if we canmake this happen. I am on it. I knewyou had it in you. Thank you. Do you like it? I love it. Let me show you. Yes. [♪♪] Hey, there she is. Hey, guys. Hey, how aboutsome pie, Megan? Mmm.... maybe later. Megan! Hey, Dad. Hey. That piece has my namewritten all over it. So... I'm going to be heading backto Chicago in the morning. Huh? So soon? I've got to get readyfor my new assignment. New assignment? I've been chosen to leadthe Sapphire Lake development. [gasps] Really? Well... well, that's wonderful. That means you'll be-- Moving back to Cedarvale, at least forthe foreseeable future. Oh, sweetheart, I am so proud of you. You know,for your mother and me, it was never aboutwhat you achieve, it was always about who you are. Your mother would beso proud of you, just like I am. Thanks, Dad. [♪♪] [Megan writes]: "Dear Joe. Just in case you're wondering, Philip and I broke up. I guess I finally realized that my heart wasn't his for the taking, because I had already given it away. It's been hard coming back home. There have been so many reminders of things that I had forgotten... Reminders of growing up with my family, my mother... reminders of who I was before I left... who I still am. Someone once said that a first love is a forever love... and, Joe, when I think of you, and me, and our love story, I know truer words were never spoken. Yours forever, Megan." [♪♪] [sighing] You really thinkit's true? About first lovesbeing forever? I do. I found your note,in our tree. How did you even...? Oh, wait, of course, Frances. I was goingto tell you about it after I was safely out of town. I figured. Um... I was sorry to hearthat things didn't work out between you and Philip. I'm not. I, um... I have something for you. What's this? It's a promise ring. A promise that's been12 years in the making. I love it. What exactly is ityou're promising me? Just this. [♪♪] [♪♪] Megan! Dad! [chuckling fondly] All right, come on, let's go. [♪♪] [♪♪]
