NETFLIX PRESENTS I told you. Of course, Miss. As you can see, the bathroom is well equipped, but for two it may be on the small side. - Or not. - Or not. The mirror is nice. It's big. It has a lot of potential. And here you have... first-rate marble. If you stand here, you can imagine what a normal day would be like, brushing your teeth or... getting ready for a night out of grinding, and... let's imagine that your boyfriend shows up and tells you how sexy you are and how much he wants to fuck you. Good luck. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - Hi. - Please come in. - Lucía, right? A pleasure. - Weren't we the first? A colleague gave her an appointment. She's going to leave a deposit, but if you like, we'll leave her hanging. Come in, please. And for you? Look, we can take these. Is there any news about the office course? Girl, it took me two years to get out of here. Yes, but anyone can do this. Sure. Will you finish that too? Hello? Yes, that's me. Thank you, Holy Mary, for listening to me. For giving me this new opportunity. I know I'm ready. I need you to help me. To give me the confidence and the strength I need. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you... - Sofía? - Yes. That's me. Good morning. Go ahead. Erm... Well, I studied finance at the University of Buenos Aires, I did a master's in International Business. An MBA here. I was top of my class in the department. I've also worked in several companies in this sector: Davandra, Fun&Co... Belén, send me the briefing for later. Of course, right away. My thesis was about your company. Last time I submitted my résumé, I attached it. I think starting all this... from scratch is incredible. Answer it. What? Hello? Yes, this is Beatriz Gaya's office, how may I help you? Yes, I understand. Yes, our apologies. Give me the mailing details. Yes, we'll check with the courier and you'll be reimbursed. How about we send you a cocktail dress from the new collection, free of charge? Perfect, Aurora. Don't hesitate to call if anything else comes up. What? Incredible. Well, thanks. You too, but I meant her. What? Right. Really nice. Okay. It's just she's so strong. She had nothing. She was a nobody. She built her whole empire. Working, trusting herself... Can you believe that her first job was dressing corpses? No way. Clothing for wakes. That's creepy. Listen, the lady I showed the apartment to today told me that she knows a guy who owns two buildings in the center. Dude, that's great. I'm sure you'll get them for the agency. Of course. But I want them for myself. Well... you need the money first. Well, you know I'm saving. And now you'll be meeting lots of real estate tycoons, for sure. Absolutely not. But, honey, you're doing an internship, right? - Yes. - They'll definitely end up hiring you. I hope so. It's what I want most in the world. A first-class ticket to Zurich at 18:00. Her usual menu. The fabric supplier in London is requesting an upward revision of the contract. - Did you quote my previous reply? - Yes. Send it again. Always shake hands. Good morning. Good morning. - Thank you for coming. - Ricardo. - I'm Sofía. - A pleasure. I'll let you know if I need you. My bag. - Come in, please. - Thank you very much. Right... Go home. - If she comes back, I'll say you're sick. - No, I'm fine. Thanks. When will I get to attend the meetings? Do I attend? Sofía. Sofía, it's very late. Go on, go home. Lidia? Hello. I thought even though you had no profile picture, you'd be hot, but... I underestimated you. - Do you want a drink? - Please. What are you doing? Not like this. - Come here. - No. Get off me, dammit! Okay. You don't like that. I'm sorry. LUJÁN 2011 MOTHER, HELP US TO TAKE CARE OF LIFE What are you doing up? What's the queen of the house saying? I'm making you a special energizing continental Mediterranean breakfast. Because my cutie pie seemed a bit sick this week and I can't have that. I don't feel like it now. You just sit tight, okay? The second course is on its way. I think what you really need is a holiday. Last night I was on my phone and I found super-cheap flights to Medellín. Well, if we buy them now. What do you say? It's now, or they'll go up. I don't know what I'll be doing in two months. I know, honey, but... I haven't been back for two years. Nor have I to Buenos Aires. Well, then, just ask for ten days off. I can't ask for ten, or two, or five. Nothing. You can't or you don't want to? What's your Romeo's name? I have no idea. Are you joking? What's this? What? I can't believe it, you've fallen too. - At last. - I don't look bad, do I? I think I look sexy. No, you don't look bad. They're so young. They don't know anything. They're like a cake full of air. Is it still worth it? Life is designed so badly. By the time you know what you want, you're out of time. Cut the drama. We're still at the halfway point. I envy you. Everything's always seemed fine to you. And which of us is the millionaire? What is it? Maybe with paillettes on the sleeves? I know. May I? Show me. I think that, by adding a double cuff, we could achieve an effect that's more... sophisticated, which... is missing. Like the '98 Adriana. The '98, did you say? - I don't think it matches the collection. - Sorry. It's normal, this isn't your area. Step aside. I like it. Another beer. - Thanks, Benja. - Thanks, Benja. You're welcome. So, what's wrong? Nothing, honey. Really. How's work? Good. I did some calculations, and what I'm saving here won't get me anywhere, but in Colombia it'd be a different story. Look, the agencies here are too big, I don't have the money to hire anyone. Okay. But I was talking to my Uncle Jorge and he'll rent us an office for next to nothing in Robledo. I could have my team there. It'd be the best for both of us. Robledo. Don't you think? I don't know, honey. Honey, Madrid is getting too big for us. I'm not getting ahead here and you don't have a life. Honey, we barely see each other. How will I start a family? How will I take the next step? How will we prosper? How will we move forward? Family? Honey, I didn't come here to go back, I didn't come here to move to Colombia, and even less to be a kept woman. I'm not saying you'd be a kept woman. I'm saying you'd work with me in something relaxed. I don't want to be relaxed. I want to be exhausted. I want to be afraid of messing up. I want... to learn from her all the time, constantly. I work 12 hours a day with her, and you know what? It's not enough. It's not enough. Right. Can I ask where you're going? Just to Barcelona. See you downstairs in an hour. It was an amazing food. Food from Asia, you know. Japanese food, Chinese food, Filipino food... And I just take it, and I was eating it to my face and I meet just a beautiful woman. And I tell her, "Oh, the food is amazing." "Are you the cook?" And she told me, "No, I'm the consul's wife." God! - I wanted to disappear, you know? - That's true. - I was sha... - Hi. How you doing? Hi, Jonathan, good to see you. - And you. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Take a seat. - Lovely to see you, finally. What's he doing here? Since you seem prone to leave me, I feel like flirting. He's a newbie, an upstart, he worked for me till last year. Yes, and he's full of energy and lack of ego. My company's ready to optimize your former dealing ten percent. We won't add a pound for ten years. You really haven't heard it? It sounds familiar, but I don't think so. Yes, without a doubt. And the other one? It's only the lingerie left. Come on, try it on. I want to see if I chose well. Let's see. Perfect. Let me try something. It makes you look stronger. You'll need to be, now you have a job in the company. I thought it was good news. It is. The best. Father... I need to know that God will forgive me. Is your regret sincere? What was your sin, my child? The Lord's infinite mercy will cleanse you, but you must first show courage to confess. I want... I'm going to end the life that I carry inside me, Father. I wanted to avoid it, and... I hesitated. Every day. But not anymore. Will God forgive me? There's no worst crime than... spilling the blood of the innocent. Good morning. What? Carmen... you've had ten registered absences in recent months. They were all justified. I brought doctor's notes, and made up the hours. No one's questioning you, but... You know about my daughter, right? You need all of your time for her. It's a good severance package. I don't want to choose between my daughter and my job. I've been in this company 15 years. I'm part of it. You have to learn it. No one taught us to act like that. They're allowed to be bastards. "Determination" they call it. So don't feel guilty. Sofía, what is it? Hey... Come here. Come. - I'm... - Easy. You're what? What, what are you? No... Wait. No, wait! Easy. Sofía, you're not pregnant? Did you know when you started? No. I thought you knew what you were doing. I don't get it. You were doing so well... I don't get it either. I'm sorry. Who knows? You. You can't do anything else, unless you want to pay half in taxes. It's 25%. You submit a promissory note in December and they deduct it in June. They're doing it for music festivals, events, start ups... Everyone at the firm is jumping in. Hey, Mr. Lawyer, is that legal? I don't want more inspections. Everyone's doing it. What inspections? It's the only way to reduce the fee. I'm having a child. What? Sofía's. Your assistant? Yes. She's pregnant and she doesn't want to have an abortion or quit her job. She'll give it to you? How far along is she? And whose is it? Is she single? No, but he doesn't know anything. She told me. Have you thought it through? Listen, wouldn't it be easier for you to adopt? I want a baby and I can't anymore. - Yes, but isn't there another way? - No. I want to experience the pregnancy. Be with it from the beginning, know it. - Will you support me? - Of course. For everything. As always. Of course. Offer her money. Lots of money. I knew I needed to bring out the good wine. Tati! Another bottle, please. - Ready? Are you alone? - Yes. Do you know why I hired you? Because you're good at your job. Because you find solutions. I don't believe we can work our way out of any mess... and not this one. Are you serious? I am. Take your time. Don't tell anyone. You'll think clearer that way. I haven't told anyone yet. There's always a way out. Always. Sofía... I'm here to help you. Whatever you need. Thank you, Beatriz. Really. Go to sleep. It's very late. Thank you. Tell me, Sofía, when was your first missed period? In... February. All right. There it is. There it is, yes. It's so small. Of course. Well, Sofía, I'm going to explain the procedure. Here we take care of the check-ups and tests, both before and after, okay? For the procedure, we'll refer you to a specialized clinic. It's a short operation. It won't hurt. It feels a bit like period cramps, that's all. In fact, they won't put you to sleep. Sedatives are usually enough. When they've taken effect, they will dilate your uterus with rods, and the suction will begin. It will take five to ten minutes. They have to be sure that your uterus is empty. What is that? Sorry, it's a control device. Do you want me to turn it off? Are you okay? I can't. I can't see it. There! Sofía, what are you doing? I don't know what to do. I... I can't have an abortion. Look, I've been giving it a lot of thought, and... I'll just tell you. I have a proposal for you. It's going to sound a little weird, but you'll see. You'll be able to become a mother whenever you want. Whenever you decide. But now is not the time, is it? All right. I have always wanted to be a mother. And... And I thought... that I could keep your baby. - You know people do these things, right? - Yes, surrogacy... No, not that. This would be different. It... I mean, it wouldn't be a surrogacy because... Because what you and I would do is something that would benefit both of us. I help you. You help me. The baby will be fine. I promise. But can you do that? How...? Well, we'd need to sign an agreement or something, of course. And you would stay by my side in the company, of course. What you and Beatriz want to do isn't completely legal. You know they're still very cautious about that matter here. Although, one way or another, people have always done it, right? In some countries it's legal, and the birth mother can receive money. It's a case of having a document which clearly states what each of you is agreeing to, and which states that you are both aware of what you are going to do. Beatriz will be the biological mother from the start, the real biological mother, and... nothing else. Well, basically, this will be a third-world adoption, but I'll take care of that, don't worry. In short, you must relinquish all rights in this matter from the intervention onward. - The intervention is the delivery, right? - Exactly. I will oversee the whole process. The intervention will happen at my clinic. So only what we decide will be known. In other words, nothing. We must maintain absolute confidentiality. It's the only way. I'll cover all the care expenses, of course. Including after the procedure. Whatever you need. About two to three days in the hospital is normal. Yes. And in exchange, Beatriz guarantees that your position in the company will be protected, and on the day of the intervention you will receive financial compensation equal to the highest received in Europe for this. I want double that compensation. Double? But, Sofía, it will be under the table. You're earning more than those girls. And it's quite a lot. Of course, but they are within the law, and I'm not. Things could go very bad for me if this gets out. Prison, deportation... That risk must also be compensated. No, there won't be that risk, because Beatriz wants you to spend the pregnancy at her home. - The entire pregnancy? - Yes. And I couldn't see anyone, right? No one should see you. We can only do this in secret, Sofía. We have no other choice. It will only be a few months. What about my job? I want to stay up to date. Of course, I'll keep you posted. We will be living together. Double the compensation and add two trips a year to Argentina. I told you she was smart. Were you always like this, or did I create a monster? You're the only one I'd do this with. I didn't tell Nacho anything. Of course. He won't be going through pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, nor will he put his career on hold. He just had an orgasm. I won't breastfeed either. And Nacho is my boyfriend. I love him. I know. I'm sorry. But, if you had told him, you wouldn't have been free to decide. What if he tells you he disagrees? Perhaps we could have gone ahead with it, but you'd have lost him. Right? Sometimes we can't do things perfectly. Only the best we can. THE SURROGATE MOTHER - It... - Don't worry, it's fine like that. All right, perfect. That's it. If this one didn't persuade you, there's a wonderful and very light apartment two blocks away. We can go see it now. - Do you have time? - No, I'm going for a drink. Thanks. Okay. Here's my card. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. Okay, see you. Hi. - What are you doing here? Coming with me? - Yes. ...the site dynamics, I'll report on the functioning of each department, suggest changes... And I would go from assistant to manager. With double the salary. But it's London. We have to talk about it. I've already... said yes. You've got to be fucking kidding me. Are you serious? Honey. I had to pass on the Colombia thing, and you've already decided this. Why don't you take the opportunity and go there? No way. Half a year? Without you? Impossible. I'm doing this for you too, okay? As well? It will go by so fast. And when I'm done, I will have moved up and saved lots of money. For both of us. And we'll be a family someday. Do you think it doesn't hurt me? I wish I could get what I want without having to go through this. But it's the only way. And it has a positive side. Let's not give it too much thought. Will you have a house? I'll come visit. And spend all of your savings on those trips? You're ending it with me. No! Honey. I'm not ending anything. I'm asking you to support me. This is really important for me. Please. I love you. Where are we going? It's a surprise. - I thought we were... - You'll be better off than in the city. I'm laughing now. - I almost had a heart attack then. - Really? Imagine, you're dressing the corpse of a 90-year-old lady and suddenly, bam! Her eyes open as if she had risen from the dead. Dammit! What's wrong? It won't open. There. Good morning. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Very well. That music means breakfast. You'll salivate just from hearing it. Hi. I think it's a birth defect. She hasn't learned a word in six months. Do you know how much the others speak? But she's a great cook. - She has your diet. - I know. No cold cuts, no alcohol and no raw fish. Cristina made this list for you too. It's not just food. There are also cosmetics, types of clothing, habits... You can blame her, but don't ignore it. Okay. I have to run. Have a great day. You too. Thank you very much. Sweet Mary, thank you for protecting me. Did I scare you? A little bit. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. Now it's time for the hurdles step. Start with your hands over your shoulders, like so. Feet together. Lift your knee and extend your leg. Touch the ground with your heel, and back. Fluid movements. Hi. Hi. Are you... watching me? What? I saw the cameras. - Are you watching me? - The security system. You're not used to it, are you? Nor do I want to be. Sweetie, I won't leave the house unprotected because you're paranoid. Or you. - I'd rather you removed them. - Do you think I have time to watch you? Beatriz, please. I... I can't live like this. I won't remove the ones outside. Okay. But inside, I'd like to feel free. - Yes? - Yes! Thank you. What do you think? I don't like them. Keep looking. You'll have to continue handling my schedule. Of course. I'll call a few more today to interview them. You were right to send her to London. I never liked her. She was an opportunist. I liked her. But she did want my job, you're right. Now she's where she belongs. Tati, have you seen my phone? I've lost it. Elbows out. Hands over your ears. Lift your knee. Extend your leg. Touch the ground with your heel and back. Like sitting on a stool. This exercise requires space. You must be on the mark to begin. I'm on the mark! This exercise requires space. You must be on the mark to get started. I'm on the mark. Lift your knee. Extend your... Enough! Will you shut up? ...knee. Extend your leg. Touch the ground with your heel, and... Can't sleep? One, two, three. Give me your phone. Phone. You don't have one? Fuck it. MY BABY AND ME I lost it. What have you lost? My phone. But you haven't left here. - Don't worry, I'll buy you another one. - Nacho must be... super pissed off. I'm sure he loves you now more than ever. I don't know. I'm scared. He's too sweet. I hope so. Look, she already has it. - Yes. - Why does it appear? Estrogen cause an increase in melanin secretion, and it's more noticeable on her because her skin is a bit darker, right? Very good. There it is. Yes! How are you feeling, Sofía? Is everything okay? Yes. - She quit doing pilates. - No... You can't stop exercising. What if she swam? She likes that. I'll make daily charts for you. In any case, the tests the other day were perfect. Fluid retention and itching are both normal. But if there's anything, if you feel anything strange, tell me, okay? No, everything is fine. Are those the eyes? Hello. Beatriz? Beatriz, are you all right? Good morning. Good morning. What about the phone? I've ordered it. The good ones take time to arrive, as you know. See you later. Tati. May I come in? The key. Key. The door. The door upstairs. Sofía! Sofía! For me? Happy birthday! Hello. - Hello. - And this too. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DOG Hello, Max. Max? No, not Max. Yes, you're Max. - Well then, Max it is. - Hello. Now he wants to invest in wineries. - Wineries? - He wants to persuade you. - No, please, not again. - He already convinced me... Did you know today's a special day, Max? ...he brought three bottles of... They're letting me eat cake. And I had... of course I was trying them... Come. ...you don't know how far... Come to the bathroom with me. I don't want you to hear odd stuff. ...in the end I think I invested in La Mancha wineries. You should know that he even... Well... - Hey... - What? How do you think she's doing? Her hormones are altered, but otherwise fine. - Fine. - Are you sure? Yes, really. - Fine. - Don't you think... I don't know, that maybe... she's having second thoughts? No. Well, I don't know, I don't think so. - Well, it's difficult for her. Imagine... - Difficult? - She's basically on holiday. - On holiday? Cristina, please... Max. Max is a nice name. I like it. - Well... - Yes, it's nice. Is Beatriz's child also going to be a boy? I mean... I won't keep him, but I'd like to know. Yes, he's going to be a boy. Cheers. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Look what I just received. You have a gift. I want to talk to him. It's my birthday. Okay. VIDEOCALL Hello, my darling. Hi. What happened? - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Fucking hell. Don't ever do this to me again. I was going crazy. I called you. I sent you a thousand messages. - I almost called the police. - No. I'm fine. I lost... I lost my phone and... I was very busy. But tomorrow or the next day I'll have a new one, so... I'll be contactable. How are you? Listen... Sofi, please, I beg you, don't do this to me. Just tell me now. I'd rather you were honest with me. I miss you so much. - I don't know... - And I love you. - I don't know. - Very much. I think that... Sofi... - Are you sure you love me? - Yes, my love. It won't be long now. Enough. Honey? My love, what is it? Are you upset? Sofía, what is it? Look, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do. - I... Are you sure you love me? - Honey, I have to go. - No... - We'll talk in the next few days, okay? Sofi, please... Sofi... - Honey... - No, now, Sofi, please. Don't go. Hello. Dammit, Max! What did you do? Tati? Be good, Max. Tati? Hi. Hello... I'm looking for Sofía Cuadros. Sorry, what? Sorry... Never? I need her phone. Do you, sorry, do you have a phone? A number or something? Okay. Thank you. I'm tired. Only ten more lengths. Come on. Why did Tati leave? Look at you. It's already noticeable. You think she'll report us? She can't speak Spanish. If you stop now, it'll be harder later. I'll do ten extra tomorrow. Your chart says 50 lengths. I can't do any more. Really. Didn't you hear me? Come on! - Just for today, please. - Come on. - I don't want to. - Come on. I told you I don't want to. It's only ten more lengths. Beatriz. Not now, Belén. It's Sofía. You have to get her out of London too. She lied to us. Lied about what? She has no degree. Just a college seminar with no grade. The schools where she got her master's don't exist. And her work experience... She's just a sales clerk. Are you sure? - Do you want to call yourself? - No. Hello, Beatriz. Cristina, did you know that Argentinian has never set foot in a university? Well, everyone lies to get a job. This bitch lied about everything. So what? How can I trust her now? Okay, she lied because she's an opportunist, and if she is an opportunist, she'll comply. It suits her. Cristina, you haven't carried a child. I'll call you back. Okay. Sofía! Sofía! Hi. What have you done? Nothing. Nothing? I touched the door. That's it. The security company could have come. If they see you here, it all goes to shit. Tomorrow's the quarterly balance report. I'll tell you how it goes. The goal was to double the previous one, but I don't know. The phone doesn't work. But it was very expensive. I don't know. It doesn't work. Lend me your tablet today. I don't want you to be there. It was very uncomfortable. Not today. What do you mean? I didn't agree to be your slave. Go. Isn't that what you want? Do you think I'm against you? That I want to ruin your life? Well, go on then! Go! It would've been much easier for me to be a mother another way. Have you forgotten how you felt when you didn't know what to do? Fuck. I just want to do things right. I know it's very hard for you to be cooped up here without Nacho. And your body's changing, which makes you much more sensitive... And you're experiencing everything more... But never forget that this is for us both. Shall I close it? - All good? Need anything else? - The bill, please. Right away. It won't be long now. I wanted to thank you for being so brave. It's normal that you miss him. This is starting to get heavy. Are you okay? Beatriz. I can't sleep. Come here. I'll be in Madrid the whole summer. And I work mornings at the store so... - Let's keep in touch? - Sure. - Do you have my number? - I think so. Wait, I'll call you. "Mario the Colombian," here you are. Bye. MISSED CALL The second proposal is a variation of the first, this time with the Allegra model. I think this could be our best bet for big events. The last proposal is a contrast with the previous ones. It fits well because of the contrast of the pure lines and the baroque feel. Beatriz, what do you think? - Beatriz? - Eh? Excuse me. Shit! Shit! Sorry, Max. What have you done? - Can you move? - Yes. Goddammit! Another step. Be careful. There. Let's see... Lie down. There. - Are you all right? - Yes. Okay... Very well. Cristina, call me when you can, please. It's urgent. ...I've talked to make-up. - Perfect. How long will it take? - Twelve. - Twelve. - Exactly. - Good morning. - Okay. I'm here to ask about Sofía Cuadros. You won't find her here. - She's at the London headquarters. - No. She's not there. Don't you know anything? The boss, where is she? She's not here either. If you leave your number I can... Hey! I told you she's not here. What are you doing? Didn't you hear me? The boss, where is she? No. Okay. - Cristina. - No, it's me, Belén. A guy's here for Sofía. Tell me where Beatriz Gaya is. - What's he like? - Handsome. About thirty. - Don't let him leave, I'm on my way. - Okay, I'll wait for you. - Tell me! - Please, don't do anything to me. This isn't about you. Can you help me? Tell me where Beatriz Gaya lives. Here, drink this. - A bit more. - Enough. This number is currently unavailable. Please leave your message. Belén, is he still there? No. He's gone. What did he want? What did he want to know? He wanted your address. And you gave it to him? Well, it's just that... - The new girl was really scared. - Fuck! - I'm sorry. Should we call the police? - No, don't call anybody. Hello? Nacho? Hello? Nacho! - Sofía, is that you? Open up! - What are you doing here? How did you find me? I went to the company. No, please. Be careful. - Sofía... - She's... crazy. I'm not well. I think she gave me something. What did she give you? Sofía, open up! - Sofía... - It's just... Call the police. Honey, it's okay. I'll get you out. I'm going to call the police. Fucking phone... Yes, get help. I have no signal here, but I will find it. No, please don't go. Don't leave me alone. Don't leave me alone, Nacho! Hello. Yes? Hello! Dammit! Hello? Nacho... Help! I'm back. Are you okay? Yes. I'm going to fix you some dinner. - I'm not hungry. - You have to eat. Beatriz. What? I thought you would be mad at me after what I did. I was so relieved you weren't really hurt, that I got over my anger. You were right in the end. It's my mood. - My hormones are driving me crazy. - Don't worry. - I don't know what I'm doing. - Yes, it's normal. Besides, it'll all be over soon. I have... I have a surprise for you. Sofía, I've been looking over the latest ultrasounds we did and I will check you again tomorrow. Is there a problem? On the contrary. It's going so well that it may end sooner than expected. If we can confirm it tomorrow, you'll have a cesarean. Why? - Explain it to me, please. - Didn't you want this to be over? Well, wish granted. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Whatever you say. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What will you do when the baby is born? Run the company from home? I can't leave anyone else in charge. They could sink it in a month. Will we continue to work together? Of course. I miss work so much... You don't know how much. I know. I'm thirsty all the time. Do you want anything? No, thanks, I'm fine. Sofía, what have you done? Saved myself. What? You wanted to take my son and get rid of me, right? You think I want to kill you? Whoever pays calls the shots. Isn't that right? I wanted a child. And you wanted a future. We agreed on that. Where's Nacho? Nacho? I don't know. What are you talking about? Where is he? You bitch! Shut up! Bring the contract. Bring... the contract. We'll tear it up and you go. I won't report you for this, I swear! Isn't that what you want? I don't know what I want! I don't know! Sofía! Sofía! Sofía, I need some water! Sofía! Sofía, we need to talk, for God's sake! Where is it? - What? - The money. There must be money in this house. Are you going to rob me? Beatriz, tell me where it is. This is ridiculous. I offered you a new life and you're changing it for a few euros? Where? You're throwing it all away for nothing. I have the contract. If you report me, I'll make it public. I will ruin you. I was wrong about you. I thought you were ready to be someone. I am someone. We're two people. Sofía, you can't leave me here. They'll find me dead. And your prints are all over the house. Untie me! I swear I'll let you go. Sofía! Max. Max. Max. Subtitle translation by:
