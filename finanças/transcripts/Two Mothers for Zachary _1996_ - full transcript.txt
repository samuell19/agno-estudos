[dial tone] [Zach laughing] They are never gonna take me off hold. Next number. How many lawyers have you been through? Three... or four.Hey, it's not our fault. They just take one look at us and they figure we're a couple of low-rent, white trash lesbians who can't pay their fees. Hey, what are you talking about? We can pay our fees. Hi! Hi. Uh, my name is Jody Shaffell, and I have a hearing this morning, and I need a lawyer. [Frank] Now, you let me do all the talking, okay? Is that a yes? You got to say "yes." The court can't record non-verbal responses. Now, you got that?Yes. Now, don't say any more than he asks. Don't elaborate, okay?Yes. Now, the law's very clear. Grandparents do not have visitation rights. There's a presumption that the child belongs with the parent. Natural order of things and all that. Can I ask you something?Hmm? Is that a yes? Yes. She can't get him, can she? Trust me. She's got no grounds. How many people in the apartment? [Jody] Three. You and the child and who else? My roommate. Roommate? Yes, sir. Maggie Fergus. We've been rooming together now for-- Just answer the question. [Rayburn] And do you sleep with Ms. Fergus? Yes, sir. [indistinct courtroom chatter] Before I render my decision, is there anything you would like to add, Mr. Chalmer? Yes, Your Honor. Given what you have just heard, we would like to recommend full custody, not merely visitation, to Nancy Shaffell. What? No way he can do that. Just don't worry about it. He can't do it. He cannot. Don't worry. No, no-- [Rayburn] This child has had prolonged diaper rash. This child has been hit. And this mother has admitted she shows open affection for Ms. Fergus. Due to these and other considerations, and given the living arrangement between these two women... I rule in favor of Nancy Shaffell. What?! What?!This court grants full custody of Zachary Lee Kinchloe to his grandmother, Nancy Shaffell. [judge banging gavel] [indistinct chatter] [judge bangs gavel once] Oh, God, I can't even believe it. I can't believe it. Okay, let's go. Listen, hon. Uh, get some extra blankets and some pillows, okay? Okay. Sweetie-pie, I'll go get your teddy bear, okay? Hey, listen. Don't forget some orange juice. We're not gonna be able to stop for a while, okay? You're gonna be just fine, sweetie. ♪♪ Dang it, dang it, dang it! Oh... should I put a blanket over him? Uh, no, no, just take your sunglasses off. Why? It'll make us look less suspicious. Okay. Oh... he's gonna pull us over. Well, if you keep turning around, he will! Okay, okay. He's gonna arrest us. W-Well, Jody, just sit. Be calm. Okay. He's gonna pull us over and he's gonna arrest us. Are his lights flashing? [siren wailing] Yes! [Jody exhales] Just pull over. What? Maggie, just pull over. [siren fading in distance] We don't know what we're doing, where we're going. Where are we going? Out of Richmond, out of Virginia, any place away from Nancy. Oh, I feel like I'm 12 years old again and running away. I just made everything worse. Well, you cannot let her have him. What am I gonna do for money? Where are we gonna live? What, are we gonna live out of this car? This car's bigger than my first apartment. That was a joke. Come on, you know me. People like me. I've got skills. I can get a job, I can take care of this family. I can't. I'm not gonna pull you into this. What are you talking about, pulling me into it? I can make my own decisions. I'm a dyke-- you try taking a girl to the prom. This is cake. [chuckle] This won't stop her, you know. Uh-uh. She's gonna be even more determined. [sighing] You don't know her like I do. Well, I will do whatever you want. Give me the keys. I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. [police siren blaring] [door closes] They still won't let me in. He's not gonna understand. He's not gonna know what's happening. I've got a right to him. I did the right thing, right? Yes. That child is mine. I've got papers that say so. Ms. Shaffell, you wanna open the door, please? Ms. Shaffell, you wanna open the door, please? Where is he? Upstairs. You certainly didn't waste any time. She's brainwashed you. She's sick-- you want Zach to be brought up by a lesbian? She be pretending to be his daddy. You should go on your knees and thank God I'm here to stop it. Maggie will be a better parent than you or Harlan could ever be. At my lawyer's suggestion, Harlan moved out. See? I make sacrifices for the child I love. Nancy! Nancy.Let me go. Can't you at least let her say goodbye? She's keeping me from him. She can't do that. They're not going anywhere. [crying] I've got to get him out of this house. [Zach] Mama. Mama. Mama. Shhh. Mama... Mama... Please don't cry. Please. Mama! I love you, sweetie. I love you. Mama loves you.Mama... Mama loves you.Mama... I'm always gonna love you.Mama... They can't stop me from seeing you. Mama... Mama...No, they can't. She can visit him. Can't you see what she's doing? She's making me look bad. Come on. Come on, Ms. Shaffell. Okay. [crying] Mama. No, I can't.Mama! Mama! My arms won't let him go. [whispering] It's okay. [both crying] Please don't. Please don't. Please don't, don't, don't, don't, don't! My arms won't let go. No. Mama! Mama! No. Mama. Mama... Come on, darling. [sobbing] Mama...Come on, darling. Come on, sweetheart.Oh, God. Come on, come on... Don't you cry. I warned you. You brought it on yourself. Now you live with it. [sobbing] Maggie... This is as serious as a heart attack. Now, if your intention is to get your son back, then you are gonna have to present an apple pie, "Hello, I'm as hetero as the next gal" type of mentality. What are you saying? That you want us to split up? No, honey, all he's saying is that the court just cares about appearances, right? Either way... once custody has been reinstated, then we can re-address how you live your life. Yeah, but what if somebody finds out the truth? Then I'm gonna be in more trouble, right? Look, you can take the high road and lose, or you can take the other road and win. But everyone knows about me and Maggie. I mean, it's been public since the beginning. You tell them it was just a phase and that you're over it now. Look, what is more important, him or her? Why do I have to choose? Why? I... I don't... Other women, other mothers, they don't even... they don't have to explain what they do in the bedroom. Other mothers do not have to define their sexual relationship by the legal standard of the commonwealth of Virginia. You know, it's a funny thing about homosexuality. People get real hinky. I'm going to make this real simple for you. Bottom line, here? Maggie, you move out. You say you love her? Prove it. [crying] [thunder rumbling] Is everything okay? Yeah, I said I'd be all right. Where are you gonna stay? With Jan? Oh, no, thank you. I'd rather stay at Vada's. Jan's not that bad.Yeah, well, all the same, Vada said I can bunk on her couch for a while, and it's close to the restaurant. You know what, Maggie, this is really ridiculous. It's your apartment. I'm the one that should be moving out. Oh, Jody, come on now. Hey-- what are you and Zach gonna do? Go back to Nancy's? I know. I know-- I should have spoke up to the judge. I should have just stood up to Nancy and to Chalmer. Oh, really?Yeah. Come on, Frank was right. He's hinky, but he's right. I don't like pretending to be something I'm not. I know. But I would never forgive myself if I thought I was the reason that you lost him. Yeah, but... [sighs] I know, I know, I know we were taking a chance, but this... I don't know what's wrong with me. It's like every time I feel threatened, I just crawl inside myself like a turtle. And me being here gives them all the ammunition they need. [thunder rumbling] You didn't turn me gay, you know. Wait a minute. Are you telling me that I wasn't your first? [laughing] [gasp] Damn! [laughter] [thunder rumbling] I'll come back tomorrow for the rest of my things. Maggie. Jody... don't. I promised myself that I wouldn't cry. [door opening, closing] [glass shatters] I want you to stay! Jody... please don't do this. No-- please, no. Don't do this. Maggie-- Maggie. Listen to me. I am supposed to set a good example for him, right? Make the world a better place, all that crap. What am I teaching him if I don't stand up for myself-- for what I believe in? But nobody's gonna blame you. If I stay a doormat? If I let Nancy walk right over me like always? No. Not this time. If she wants a fight, let's just give it to her. I love you! [laughs] You got a problem with that? [crying] Let's go in. [laughter] Be direct. Be very direct. And see if you can't work in the word "hinky." I know what I'm doing. Cripes, I've been let go, terminated, and out-and-out fired. I think I can handle this end of it. Uh, yes, I... may I please speak to Mr. Martin? Mr. Martin, hi, yes. This is Maggie Fergus. You know what? Jody would like to speak to you. [mouthing words] Here she comes. Hi, Mr. Martin. Yes, I'm calling from the apartment. And Maggie's still here. No, it's not like I don't appreciate everything you've done for us, but I've made up my mind. I know. I know. I-- You're right. You're right. But it all got a little too hinky for us. [laughs] [laughing] Oh, way to go, Jody, like the yellow pages weren't bad enough. What are you gonna do, shop for a lawyer in the classifieds? Think maybe the newspaper would be interested in our story? What? Whoa, whoa. Do you know what you're saying? If we do this, it... it'll never be the same again. Oh, Nancy's gonna take this as a declaration of war. Then let's bring out the big guns. [indistinct speaking over intercom] Hey, Jan, where have you been? Hey, Jody. Cute picture. Yeah, you didn't look too bad on the evening news either. Thanks-- boy, this place hasn't changed. Hey, wanna grab some lunch? Um, no, I kind of got other plans. Anybody I know? I don't think you'd really like them. They're not really your type. [sighing] [overlapping chatter] [voice] He did have 36 points, that was two weeks ago. He had four rebounds. That's what it was, an assist... there's a big difference. See you later. Hey, Dwayne, Eddie. Hey, Jody. Where's your girlfriend? [laughter]Hey, can we watch? Zach's asleep. I'm not going to wake him. You come back later.But I want to see him. I'm the legal guardian. The court made it clear that what I say goes for Zach. You said I could see him whenever I wanted. Where are you going to take him, back to Maggie? Oh, come on, Mama, why are you doing this? I am doing this because I love Zach. Because there's true love in my heart. You call this love? Jesus-- you're taking me to court. You're keeping my son from me! This is not love! Mama, what about me? I'm still your daughter! As long as you're with her, you're not my daughter. You come back later, when he's awake. [door closes] Why should I represent you? What makes you think you deserve custody? Because she's a great mom. Because it's her kid. I mean all of a sudden she doesn't have rights? Why, because Zach has a diaper rash or because Nancy Shaffell says she's not fit? No, because you chose Maggie over your own son. She did no such thing. Look, the State of Virginia considers homosexual behavior a class six felony. [laughs] Well, aren't we the criminals? Too bad we're not fine upstanding straight citizens like all those wife beaters and child molesters and murderers. Now, they've got custody of their kids, don't they? Ms. Fergus. Yeah? It might be best if you wait in the other office. Why? [phone ringing] Why don't you move out? I can't afford it. If it's a matter of money-- And it would be a lie. [sighing] ...I'll set you up with an apartment and a job. I have a place to live. You'd get him back. Dad, when you got remarried, did you have to choose? I'm not choosing Maggie over Zach. Look, all my life, I have... been in places where I just don't fit. Places that didn't want me. But when I met Maggie... and we made a home... I fit. We all fit. You know, the lesbian community has made this woman into a hero. And the real hero in this is the grandmother. The mother didn't care. She beat the child. To the extent she had to have counseling. [doorbell ringing] There's the babysitter. She's always late. ...his daddy and who is his daddy. Oh, hi, Kathleen. You're late. Okay, Zach, Mama will be back soon. Here's some juice. ...last two or three years. Very unstable.There's a number here in case... And she's concerned about what's going to happen if this relationship continues, And Jody asserts it's going to continue. Clearly, this mother is unfit. Look at this. The Virginia Supreme Court says that if you exhibit homosexual or lesbian behavior, that renders you... Where did all these people come from? It's a sad commentary about the moral decline in this country. The average person in Virginia, especially Richmond, or any place almost in Virginia, views D.C. and L.A. as stark raving mad. The general consensus is that this country is about... the same place as the Roman Empire when the Roman Empire fell because of lesbianism, homosexuals, and things such as this. Why aren't they interested in heterosexuals? Because we don't get out there and advocate oral sex on television. Now, did your attorney tell you the reasons the juvenile court took custody away from you? Because I'm living with Maggie. Because you're a lesbian living with Maggie. As a matter of fact, the juvenile court judge wouldn't let you have visitation if Maggie was present, is that correct? Yes.Now, knowing all that, you still took the chance and went back with Maggie? Doesn't that indicate in your mind that you think more of Maggie than you do the child? Objection. The question is argumentative, Your Honor. Withdraw it, Your Honor. Your witness, Counselor. How frequently did Harlan have sex with you? Whenever he found convenient times. What would that end up being on an average weekly or monthly or yearly basis? Um... every other day. When it was occurring... you didn't tell your mother, right? Right. Why not? I just couldn't tell her. I-- I couldn't hurt her. And he-- he made the comment that, if she ever found out, it would kill her. Did you tell any legal authority, such as police officers, juvenile people, or anyone else? No. Did you eventually tell your mother? Yes. What was her reaction? She didn't believe me at first. [distant coughing] Tell me about Zach. [sighing] He's a bundle of joy. You have to know him. He shouldn't be raised by two lesbians. What have been your observations of the child since the visitations began with his mother? One Tuesday night he came home, he stomped his foot and told himself, "Zach, go to the corner." And he stood in the corner. Do you ever make Zach go to the corner? No. I would like to offer this picture of Zach standing in the corner as Exhibit "A," Your Honor. I don't care how my daughter lives. Zach is going to be physically and mentally harmed in this. He's going to go through so much dogging. Anything else concern you about it? It's unfit. Do you think, given the circumstances, that Zach should have any relationship with his mother? He should know who she is. Other than that, do you think he should have a relationship with his mother? I would never deny his mother. She should have her visitation. And you were not aware that Harlan had been sexually abusing Jody from the time she was 12 until she was 17? No, I didn't. When did you first find out about it? When Jody called me on the phone to tell me. And did you confront Harlan with it? Yes, I did. Did you ask him to leave the house because of that? Not that night, no, we talked. You asked him to leave the house so that you could gain custody of Zach, is that correct? No, oh, no. I thought that's what you testified to? We figured she might let me seek my visitation rights if Harlan was out of the home. And did Jody tell you that she did not want Zach in the home with Harlan because Harlan had abused her? Maggie told me that. Maggie told you that?Yes. Did you ever talk to Jody about it? She got on the phone. Did she tell you? Yes, she did. And you didn't believe her, did you? In a way I did... and I didn't. I had no reason to believe her. In your opinion, Bobby Lee, based upon what you saw, is Jody a good mother to the child? No, sir. Would you tell the court why you think that? Well, frequently she has admitted she was never fit to be a mother. She was not ready to be a mother. Just the way she put herself towards me, I don't see where she's fit to be a mother. Yourmother, Nancy Shaffell. What relationship does she have with Zach based upon what you see? It's very close. It's very, very close. Now, the bed wherein the baby slept, where was that physically located? Was that in the same bedroom with Jody and Maggie? Yes, sir. In your opinion, based upon what you observed, is Jody Ann a good mother? Objection! Objection! Overruled. I don't know. Uh, I don't feel it's right what she's doing. The way her lifestyle is. She's changed. It's like I don't even know her anymore. I mean, I expected this from Robert Lee. Nothing in the world is gonna make him go against Nancy. But Jan knows everything. She knows.Well, she's scared. She's scared. All right, but she's supposed to be my friend. Well, she's afraid everybody's gonna think she's one of us. Please. I'm real sorry she's worried about what people are gonna think. In the meantime, I'm losing my son. [sighing] [courtroom chatter] Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yeah, I do. State your name. Keith Kinchloe Jr. You're the father of Zach Kinchloe? Yes, sir. What is your preference as to where Zach should live and whose custody he should be in as between Nancy and Jody? I object to the witness being allowed to answer that question. What weight would that give me? His preference? What evidence would that give me? You would know what the father feels is in the best interest of his own son. Of whom he has given up custody. He gave up custody to the mother. Merely by agreeing that the mother would have custody is not a relinquishment of any rights. I am going to sustain the objection. [courtroom reacts] [bailiff] All rise. [gavel bangs] In reaching my decision, I have had to consider my duty as a judge. I say simply this, that I'm bound by the law of the Commonwealth. The mother, Jody Shaffell, has openly admitted in this court that she is living in an active homosexual relationship. She admits that she is sharing a bedroom and her bed with another. Her female lover. She readily admits the open affection shown to Maggie Fergus in front of the child. Examples were kissing, patting. All of these in the presence of the child. She further admits that the child referred to her lover as "da da." I do recognize there's a presumption in the law in favor of custody being with the natural parent. And then I must ask myself, are Jody Shaffell's circumstances of unfitness of such an extraordinary nature as to rebut this presumption? And I find that there is evidence of the child being affected or afflicted. The unrebutted evidence of the cursing, the child standing in the corner. From all the facts and circumstances I have heard here today, from all the circumstances of this case... ...it is the order of the court that the custody will be with the grandmother, Nancy Shaffell, and that Jody, the mother, will have visitations. I further order... that there will be no visitation in the mother's home and no visitation in the presence of Maggie Fergus. That is the ruling of the court. [gavel bangs] [courtroom murmuring] [gasping] Oh, my, I'm so excited. [female reporter] Jody, what's your reaction to Paxton's decision? [Lily] My client has no comment at this time. [male reporter] What's your next step? Are you gonna keep fighting? Please, you're talking to a mother who's just lost custody of her son. What are you gonna say to Zach? No comments! [sighs] I should have run when I had the chance. We'll appeal. There's still the appellate court, and we've got a good chance. Change the law-- that's the point, isn't it? So no one else has to go through this.I don't want to be the lesbian test case anymore. I don't care about other people's rights. I just want him back. [engine sputters] [distant dog barking] Bye-bye, baby. Bye, Mama. [Nancy] Hey, little man? How are you? Mwah. Go on. Why don't you just go away forever? Just disappear and leave us all alone. You and your stupid appeal. You like the publicity, and you and your new friends have turned this thing into a circus. You're not a lesbian. I know you. I've lived with you! Did we grow up in the same house? Have you not been paying attention the last 20 years? You deserve what you get. You keep being her favorite, Robert Lee. Just go ahead. Keep being her good boy. She loves me. Really? Lucky you. [engine starts] Mama.What? I miss my mom. I know you do, darling. Hey, that's a good biscuit. Mmm. You know that Mama loves Zachary Lee more than anything in the whole wide world, don't you? You'll see Mama on Monday. My little man. That's a great one. Pull him out and make another. I love you, Mama. [crickets chirping] [Zach giggling inside] [Nancy laughs] Yes! [birds chirping] [engine starts] A non-parent is granted custody over a parent only when the parent is unfit. Or if having custody has proven to be deleterious to the child. In this case, the evidence fails to prove that Jody Shaffell abused or neglected her son. To the contrary, the evidence showed that Jody Shaffell is and has been a fit and nurturing parent who had adequately provided and cared for her son. Although Jody Shaffell resides with Maggie Fergus in an open lesbian relationship, no evidence showed that they engaged in illegal sexual behavior in the child's presence. No evidence showed that the child has or will suffer any emotional or psychological distress as a result of the relationship. Accordingly, we hold that Jody Shaffell is not to be deprived of the custody of her son. We reverse and vacate the circuit court's order and remand the case with directions that the circuit court enter an order effectuating the resumption of custody by the mother of her son. [cheering and applause, gavel bangs] Congratulations. [applause continues, gavel banging] Your Honor, at this time I would like to file a notice of appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court. We further ask for a stay until the Supreme Court renders a decision, therefore maintaining Judge Paxton's original custody order, which is currently in effect. So granted. What? What's that mean? Until the Virginia Supreme Court hears the case, Nancy keeps custody. But I won! [courtroom murmuring] [birds chirping] [vacuum whirring] [vacuum stops] [sighs] ...of the governor's ethics commission and a member of the Family Foundation, co-founder of the Family Foundation, who agrees with the decision of the judge. Why? Well, Larry, I think what we're talking about is not unfit mothers as much as unfit lifestyles. This lifestyle, just as much as a mother's love is natural, this lifestyle is against the laws of nature. And laws of nature are something that we can't say are antiquated... I have done nothing to this woman. And what are you doing to yourself? Oh, I know. You're making yourself feel better before you hear the Supreme Court decision tomorrow. That's a real good idea. [Larry King] Where are they written? Uh, well, they're written in the Virginia code, okay-- The laws of nature are written in the Virginia code? Yes, and it's... Ain't that the ever-loving truth. ...under the title, crime against nature. If we, in a society, abandon the laws of nature, go against what are historical norms in a civilized society, then we open up that society...Oh, my God. ...for real dysfunction, real moral disorder. You know, no one has given me this right, but I want to be able to say, I want you to go home, start over, be with your mama. Be with your little boy. The ACLU has turned you into a poster child. I hate it. I hate to see what you're going through, and I hate to see you being exploited." [Larry] And you would respond how to Anne? I should have said something to her. I can't believe I didn't say anything to her. Okay, Jody, that's it. Give it to me. Jody, give it to me! Come... What are you doing home already? They've been kind enough to give me a permanent vacation. I thought they loved you. Well, they did. Till all of this happened. [chuckling] Oh, I know, my fault! Hey, that's not what I'm talking about. I can't take it. I can't take it. No!It's gonna be all right. No, I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out! Jody, what are you talking about? You're just a case of nerves. Look, why don't you start smoking again or, I don't know, vacuum a little more? You're not quitting. I don't care anymore. I don't care about Nancy, I don't care about Robert Lee, I don't even care about you.Or Zach. You know, did you ever think maybe they're right? Maybe I don't deserve him? Hell, he might be better off without me. Oh, I know, why don't we ask him? Hey, Zach, we're taking a survey of three-year-olds to see how many of them think they'd be better off without their mama. You are not changing my mind! Oh, hey, I'm only here to help, but look, if you wanna take off, your car needs gas. I'm going.Oh, I know. I really am. Because I cannot take one more court decision. I cannot listen one more time about how unfit I am. How-- How I don't care about my child because he's got diaper rash. How she's the one raising him. She's the one making all the sacrifices! Hey, hey, Jody, give up. Go ahead. They're gonna make their decision whether you're there or not. Wha-- Oh, baby! You got me. I want you out of the car. Okay.Really, I'm serious. You never take me seriously. I'm gonna put $5 worth in it. If that don't mean I'm taking you serious, I don't know what does. I hate it when you humor me. Listen, you got extra change to get me a cherry slushee? You really should have something healthy. Something green. Okay, then make it a lime slushee. [sighing]Thank you. You're Jody Shaffell. The lesbian, right? They're having that hearing tomorrow. Well, I'm a grandmother. I have three children and five grandchildren. And I want you to know that I think what you're mother is doing is terrible. Just terrible. You keep fighting, honey. People know what's right. [softly] Thank you. [both chuckling] Let me call you right back. Ben and Lily aren't here yet. They're coming back from court. But when you called, you said the decision had already come in. Is that it?They haven't had a chance to review it. "The Court of Appeals failed to give proper deference "to the trial court's findings and misapplied the law. "The evidence is plainly sufficient to support findings "that the mother is an unfit custodian at this time, "and that the child's best interest would be promoted by awarding custody to the grandmother." [flipping pages] Can you read that? I can't. [Beth] "We shall not overlook the mother's relationship "with Fergus and the environment in which the child "would be raised if custody is awarded the mother. "Thus, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be reversed, "and the case will be remanded, awarding custody of the child to Nancy Shaffell." Sorry we're late. Hey, guys, come on, the decision's coming down today. Good thoughts, right? Oh, no. I thought it would go our way. [Ben] Four to three. We only needed one more judge. Well, we can still go to the U.S. Supreme Court, can't we? I'm afraid not. But at least they left the door open for Jody to regain custody. What are you talking about? She just lost. No custody case is ever completely closed. Change of circumstances...Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Change of circumstance. I don't know what that means. We just have to prove her fitness. But it'll mean starting all over again. And in the meantime? You still have visitation. That hasn't changed. You can see him. Once a week. But not with Maggie present and not at the apartment. ♪♪ I've got the late shift, so you've got the run of the place. What they've done to you and that boy, it's no wonder he's had such a hard time. A little child not allowed to play in his own little room, with his own little things. Back and forth and back and forth. They should make the adults change houses. Zach, don't you overfeed those fish. Say "night-night, Vada." Night-night, Vada.[chuckles] Are you ready for bed? Mama, can I come home with you? Not yet, baby. Why? Because the judge says "no." Why? It'll be soon, okay? Can I see Maggie? You want to see Maggie? Yeah, you can see Maggie. When you come home. Can I have a kitty? Yeah, maybe. [both giggling] Okay, Mama.Okay. You sleep tight. Mmm... Don't let the bedbugs bite. [laughs] Hi, there. Hi, Mama. Good-bye, Mama. ♪♪ Bye, Mama. Here you go. ♪♪ ♪♪
