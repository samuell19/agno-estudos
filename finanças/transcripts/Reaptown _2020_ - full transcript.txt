Your training's in building 11. I'm dropping you off quite a bit early. - Hello? Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Lauren. - Hi. - Do you have an article for me? - Well, first off, I'd like to say I really like your blazer. - Thank you, and the article? - Yeah, so as you know, I've been studying women's correctional facilities and I've actually been focusing on one in a town called Reaptown. So I think something is going on. There's been five women, five women that I know of, who have all been released on a work release program. And each one of them have completely vanished and every single one of them has had the same work release. They had to go to a railway nearby, patrolled overnight, they've all vanished, every single one of them. And each of them have a little to no family, hardly any friends. And I did talk to a couple of friends and everybody's concerned that something suspicious is going on. Now, I did talk to a Parole Officer, asked him a lot of questions to which they wouldn't answer any of them. In fact, they're completely evading me. I did a followup phone call, didn't even call me back. So I really think something suspicious is going on with these women, and I was just wondering if I could please focus my piece more on these women. - Lauren, I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but you know this is a legitimate publication house, we don't publish conspiracy theories. - Okay, I know it sounds a little bonkers, but my gut is telling me this is not a conspiracy theory and I bet this is happening again right now. Enter passcode. New message. Hey, Carrie it's Donna. What are you doing walking around hanging up posters?

We haven't had an easy life, I was desperate for money, we should have never done what I did. Please let her go free. Thank you, Carrie Baldwin. Here are the keys. Your training is in building 11, right up here. Hello and welcome to your work release training at the Reaptown railway, please pay careful attention, this message will not repeat. This training is a test to prove your ability to follow directions and reintegrate yourself as a functioning member of society. You are tasked with patrolling a railyard property overnight. In front of you are the tools you will need for the job. You will use the security map to locate the check end terminals. The box with a letter T is an example of the terminal. You will use the labeled security ID card number three to check in at each location. Simply place the card against the terminal until you hear a beep. Follow the order on the map to properly check in at each location. Your shift begins now. You will be picked up to return to your room at 6:00 a.m. - What! This is such bullshit. Hey. C'mon get out of the tub. Come on, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, we're gonna get through this. We've a little jail time, is nothing worse than we've been through before Trish. Open the door. Don't be like this. Open the door, we're gonna get through this like we have everything else. Come on, get out of the tub. I'm right here, we're gonna get through this. Come on, I'm right here, I'm always gonna be right here. Hi, Donna, it's Carrie, I just got back from that training, if that's what you wanna call it. What kind of work release program is this? If you could call me back, I've got a lot of questions. You know how to get ahold of me, thanks. Hi, this is, I saw you putting up posters for that missing girl, and I wanted to tell you you're not safe here. You'd be better off breaking parole and leaving. Don't tell anyone about this, especially Donna, it would make things much worse for you, I'm sorry. - What the fuck. Hey Carrie, it's Donna, I just tried to call your room and you didn't answer, I'm hoping you're asleep or in the shower. I got your message, if you had read the papers I gave you, you would have known that it was an automated training. Anyway, the guy said you did a great job, keep it up. - Hi, this is Carrie Baldwin, 8204. My sister was staying here previously. Do you know if she left anything in her room? Yeah, yeah, she left a couple of things. I have it here in the lost and found. I'm not supposed to give to anyone but her, but if you're he sister, I need you to meet me in the laundry room and I'll give it to you. - In the laundry room, sure, yes. Okay, I'll get it out. - Hi, this is Lauren. Hi Alexis, hi, yes, give me a second, lemme pull over this Okay, okay thank you. Hi, so as I said my name is Lauren and I'm a journalist and I've been doing a story on women in correctional facilities, specifically the women over there at the Reaptown Correction Facility and I- Oh, oh yes, okay sorry. I got your number off of your Amy, your friend, Amy, her Facebook page. I noticed you had listed it on her wall and I really appreciate you returning my call. Yeah, well, I was wondering, have you heard from Amy recently? Okay, well, when was the last time you did hear from Amy? Oh she was on a work release. And do you know where the work really sent her? The local railyard, okay. Well, do you know if any of her other friends maybe have heard from her? Not big on friends, okay. How about family members? Okay, well, if you happen to hear from her or a friend or family member does, I would love It if you could give me a call back, now that you have my number, I'd really appreciate it. Yeah, no, thank you so much for your time, Alexis. Okay, take care. I hate this so much, I have nothing and with my sister still in jail, it feels like I have no one. I feel so stupid for being in this position in the first place. We don't even do drugs and now we have drug trafficking on our record. Whoever came up with desperate times calls for desperate measures didn't mean sell drugs if you're broke. Now we have no job, no money, nowhere to live and we owe money all over the place. I can't wait for Carrie to get out so we can go back to Vegas and start rebuilding our life. I start my work release training this week at the railyard, Reaptown is beyond weird. The few people I have seen, they don't look at me or stare at me like I'm some. I broke the rules and left my room last night to walk by the railway yard where working. The railway yard is really cool and old. It's really strange though, because I heard a baby crying inside of a building for quite awhile and I didn't see anybody around. Hopefully, at least that means I'll be working with some women I guess. - Baby crying. Hello? New message. Hi, it's me again. Look, I used to be a Parole Officer here and my husband used to work at the railyard. I'm assuming that you and the other girl who's gone missing don't have any other family. That's not a coincidence. I don't mean to scare you, but you need to know this. If you're gonna stay here, there's some stuff you need to know about that railyard. I'll be right there. It's too much for me to tell you now, but when you go back there, look for the basement. In the room with all of the train engines there's a basement somewhere. You'll need to look for it, it's kind of hidden. I remember going through red doors before we found it anyway, in the basement, there is a box alone by itself on its own stand, you can't miss it. Listen to what's in that box, good luck. - Vegas sisters, Carrie and Trisha Baldwin arrested for drug trafficking charges, sent to women's correctional facility, Reaptown. It is June 3rd, 1972, at 12:55 a.m. My name is Susan Vanga, I'm here at the Reaptown railyard with my assistant Jordan, say hello Jordan. Hello. And we're joined by the manager of the railyard, Mr. Thomas Ruger. - Hello. - Mr. Ruger, please explain on record why you have requested our services here at Reaptown railyard? I'm not sure where to start with that. Is there someone here you would like us to try and communicate with. Yes. Give us some background. This town wouldn't exist without a mine, or the railyard, today the railyard is a museum, but back in the early 1900's, it was the cornerstone of this community. One of the mines was still operating in 1902, there was no town, so they put the word out everywhere, and people came from it almost seemed like all over the world to work here at the mine. All of the trains leave the town during the night and when the train was in the middle of the desert, a young girl went missing, the train stopped and the search was conducted, she was never found. Everyone on board that train was suspicious of a man named Warren Verne. - Hello, I got your email, I no longer live in Reaptown, but I have information that could help you. There is a link to the missing women. Most of the town is aware but keep quiet. You need to know about a man named Warren Verne. Why Warren? This reported that the way he stared made women and children very uncomfortable. And he was one of the only men who traveled alone. A woman whose husband worked at the railyard went missing, women and children continued to vanish almost always near the railyard. Did anything link the disappearances? Yes, some of the women, the days before they went missing, they reported hearing a baby crying. And in the middle of a snow storm in 1907, another woman whose husband worked at the railyard vanished. This time, people had had enough, the town's people gathered together and searched the entire property, and that's where they found him, eating that woman. He attacked one of the men and bit out his throat. Was he arrested? No, he was dragged down here to the railyard and forced into the firebox of a locomotive, burned alive. They took a train out down at the mines fire, until there was nothing left inside the fire box. Now I have to ask, why is it you asked to communicate with him? Because it hasn't stopped. There are still missing here and people still see him here. I've seen him myself, covered in ashes. Our employees are afraid to come here at night. And the town can't afford to shut down this museum. Susan? Susan? Susan can you hear me? Susan? Susan? Susan can you hear me? Susan. What's she doing, look at her eyes. Susan? Hello. - Hi donna, it's Carrie. I quit, I'm not doing this. First of all, whatever you stole from the railyard last night, you better put back tonight. Your driver told us, and if you quit it's back to jail for even longer. You are on work release, you wanna go back to jail? - No. Hello. - Okay, okay. No, no. Come on. When I was a little girl, my mom always told us when times get tough and you get tired, you can't lay down and give up, because people will step over you. But if you keep going and open your heart and your mind, somebody will give you a hand. It's human nature. - Hi, this is Lauren. Carrie, hi, my name is Lauren, I'm a journalist. Listen, where are you right now? You're going to Vegas, okay, perfect. Okay, go to Vegas, listen up, I'm here to help you. Okay, I'm gonna help you. I know, I know exactly what's going on, I know everything. Yes, go to Vegas, this is my number, I want you to save it. Call me as soon as you get there, I'm gonna help you. I'm here for you, okay, I'm gonna help you out, okay. Talk to you soon.
