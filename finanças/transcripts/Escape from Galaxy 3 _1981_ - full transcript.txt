[Music] [Applause] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] father captain lithium has reported to me that the cosmic radar has picked up an unidentified spacecraft which doesn't belong in our galaxy i feared this it's auraclon the king of the night in our galaxy i've always reigned offending peace and justice [Music] but oracle the powerful king of the night wants to take over my kingdom and territories sire we have the weapons to defend ourselves and everyone is ready and willing to fight we cannot remain pacifists we have to face this enemy or clone has more advanced weapons than we have sire we must put plan epsilon into action but the epsilon plan is still untried it has to complete final testing well we may have to use it anyway as a last resort we have no choice i here with declare a state of emergency everyone to his post don't worry father i'm sure we'll overcome the dark forces of evil bell star our clone is too powerful and too greedy it will be an unequal fight and i foresee the end of our beloved exelon no father i'm sure our planet will come through in the end it has to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] have you activated the anti-gravity systems yes good now put me in contact with that stubborn king of excellence but once malone [Music] zeno can you hear me i can see and hear you speak i'm sure you understand that this is not one of my usual peaceful reconnaissance flights into your galaxy you've made yourself very clear oracle then you surrender it's useless for me to surrender you'll still destroy my subjects therefore my answer is never so be it excellent will be destroyed because of your blind stupidity good riddance [Music] jamal listen prepare for attack yes lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] action stations all units turn on the laser barrier switch over to direction control course 4 0 13 15th dimension [Music] repair the uranium vapor rockets [Music] sire we must counter attack with our forward observation craft no lethal i will not sacrifice any human lives in a hopeless battle very well i'll use the remote control attack modules control room prepare the attack modules for launching fire one [Music] fire right on target [Music] now [Music] spread them all [Music] watch out [Music] fire [Music] [Applause] keep firing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] this is only the beginning [Music] [Music] sire the central computer received a direct hit our only hope now is to obtain help from our ally antares listen yes sir you're the only one i can trust with this with such a dangerous mission take my daughter with you as my ambassador let's hire what about the defense of our space station i can't i'll take command of it we'll throw up a shield of mega rays to cover you during liftoff very well now go you have much time good luck you too [Music] sorry [Music] so [Music] time [Applause] [Music] [Music] use the hypersolar missile systems the hydrogen booster units are already at 6000 mega degrees we'll not only get antares we'll get every king in the galaxy to fight at our side oracle's days are numbered [Music] three two one now sailor now it's your [Music] [Music] turn [Music] [Laughter] all units stand down mission accomplished we can return to base now someone has managed to elude me bell star eu galactic idiots imbeciles they'll star and lithium are escaping we are not returning to base until i have their heads at my feet whatever the cost look horoclon has discovered our escape still we have a lead on him and our craft is much smaller and easier to maneuver much slower [Music] [Music] increase speed assume delta formation the course is zero three nine two i repeat three nine two coming at us from all sides check the pressure of the defensive shield i'll start up the magnetic generators we'll make a run for it if we drop away on a zero tangent we'll come under the influence of krithos its negative gravitation will thrust us into deep space the defensive shield is operative all energy levels are go well now we'll find out if the epsilon plan really works ready yes [Music] [Applause] bell star if you hope to deceive me you have failed no one from excellent is going to escape death especially not you the daughter of its king fire fire [Music] welcome [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] i've isolated the inertial circuits the damage is limited the left quadrant indicates we're off course right the computer is already handling that we're protected by the omega unit which is activated automatically the moment there's a navigational malfunction how did they manage to disappear like that the cosmic radar scanning rays can no longer pick up their signal [Music] fool jamal we must find them use a megametric teleprobe and scan the whole eastern galaxy wait including the equidistant conic tangent calling all units deploy in delta formation lower altitude by a thousand degrees i'm glad that's over but the emergency power units are not sufficient when they give out will be adrift in space forever where do you think we are now we have no way of telling i propose we land on the first asteroid we encounter and try to repair the navigational system and we can't even go back oreclon will still be looking for us right and if we land anywhere we may not have enough power to lift off again well let's see how much maneuverability we have left [Music] we're getting nearer and nearer to a heliocentric point what solar system is it it's impossible to calculate for sure listen come and look at this i don't see any volcanic deserts and there are no visible craters it's completely unlike any planet i've ever seen before but strange colors this is where we can make our repairs bring us closer it's amazing i've landed on planets all over the galaxy but never without charts or surface coordinates well do you want to risk it yes check the composition of the atmosphere according to the computer the atmosphere is oxygen and nitrogen with a small percentage of carbon dioxide perfect now keep your fingers crossed [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] one [Music] ugh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] right [Music] [Applause] no don't you they're only frightened don't worry i won't kill anyone [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well that's not exactly what you call a warm welcome no somehow we must make them understand that we come in peace we can try i've got an uncomfortable feeling it's not going to be that easy [Music] so [Music] so [Music] there's no one here [Music] [Applause] uh one person speak at a time now then what has happened i saw a giant flying monster come down from the sky it landed over there and two people in strange clothes came out of it they've come to destroy it did you do anything to to harm them we tried to talk to them but it was impossible they have supernatural powers i say they're not human [Applause] so [Music] so [Music] um come and look for yourself they're in the ravine wait here for my return [Music] uh what kind of a planet have we landed on evidently these people are 20 or 30 000 years behind our times we must take the women and children to a safe place in case they attack we must be prepared [Music] what is that stuff it's water i once saw some in my father's collection of intergalactic minerals what do you use it for it's two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen no what are you trying to do you crazy hey no [Music] you have no reason whatsoever to be afraid now hide among the rocks i promise you that before they can harm us we will capture them follow me [Music] maybe it's their way of talking with each other or communicating very interesting [Music] why don't we try it too [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] hey stop wait we're friends [Music] can you hear voices yes it seems as if people are all around us spying on us they're up there or maybe they're over there [Music] oh [Music] we'll surround them and disarm them before they can use their weapons i don't want them hurt come on strange i could have sworn they were coming from here what do you make of it i guess it was an acoustic phenomenon a repetition of sounds has played a trick on us let's get back to the ship [Applause] [Music] uh we come in peace we have no intention of harming you [Music] take them away [Music] i really can't understand here we are prisoners of these primitive people let me use my beta ray we could blast our way out of here in seconds i know but i'm sure with a little patience we'll be able to convince them we don't mean any harm [Applause] that's enough [Applause] we agree all of us they must die they must be burned [Applause] they must be burned alive their bodies consumed by the flames and their ashes thrown to the winds in this way their evil spirits will be destroyed forever along with their bodies [Applause] [Music] hmm intruders you give us no choice we're not of our world we cannot risk being destroyed by your supernatural powers and so my people have decided that you must die [Applause] my child somebody help please [Applause] [Music] oh no please [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] how much longer are we going to put up with this evidence i don't know what psycho-energetic force is i'm running out of patience i don't know how to thank you forgive us for what we've done you have offered ample proof that you mean us no harm yeah they're making fools of us [Music] i'll have somebody's head for this [Music] it's all right don't be afraid you i've seen you before you know that come on you too come over here what's that you got there they're flowers may i see them you're a small one aren't you will you teach me to jump like you of course i will mine a pretty little girl what a great ring you like it off you go children come along hope they haven't been bothering you please forgive them they're only children they're so cute perhaps we allow them too much freedom they weren't being a nuisance [Music] my people these strangers from a world that is alien are welcome among us being simple and peace-loving they deserve our hospitality we are the only survivors of an ancient and ill-fated civilization may the good spirits protect you [Applause] where exactly are you from you're the first visitors we've had since we settled well what kind of a horrible monster is that [Music] that's a water buffalo there's no need to be frightened it's quite a harmless animal it's true it's harmless [Applause] what are they doing here we're constructing a dam and we have to finish it before the rainy season comes if the river overflows its banks it will flood the fields and destroy our crops and we will have no food this winter all right all together now you mean these rocks have to be piled up across the river yes it's a long slow job they're very heavy you down there move out of the way [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] even when he was stroking me there was a strange light in his eyes and he started bundling me all over my body until he climbed up on top of me and it was fantastic you must try it here give me your hand [Music] don't you feel anything inside anything at all no excuse me [Music] [Music] don't you feel anything at all i can feel that your uh stroking me and that's all what am i supposed to feel strange that boy really seemed to enjoy it hey wait can you help me please do you fancy him i do he's nice [Music] because he wants you i'd have it would you like to have me sure yes go with that sit down listen relax and watch how we do it [Music] um [Music] it's auraclone he's found us we'll have to abandon this planet as soon as possible otherwise he'll destroy it and these people don't deserve such a terrible fate how can we leave we haven't repaired the navigation system yet we've got to go activate the defensive shield we're picking up radiation could it be from a spacecraft below yes activate the [ __ ] scanner [Music] there that should do it it's the planet earth signals strengthens diminishment of course we're getting radiation they destroyed themselves in an atomic war but the radiation was strong and then it died out it must have been them my lord no it could be a hundred other things as well scan the planet for further signs of life and then bring us back it's the only solution every inch of this planet will be scanned we will find them [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my father used to tell me stories of far off planets when i was a child i thought they were fairy tales he told me that the people of these planets live extremely short lives these people are so technologically backward i'm not surprised but there is something attractive about the way they live [Music] maybe science alone is not enough why have we never been taught about these things my father also said that the people who've tasted the joys of life lose their gift of immortality you mean we aren't immortal anymore does it matter [Music] princess princess it's the first time you've called me that listen what's the matter i'm not sure [Music] it's done if we use the emergency boosters we can leave any time we like let's try it no it's too dangerous because uh if you i'm sorry when you stand so close my mind goes blank i forget what i'm trying to say if we activate any energy source aurocline will pinpoint our location immediately okay what do we do then [Music] i think we'd better get back to the [Music] village [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] tasty it's good [Music] it's good what is it [Music] like this oh no you have to chew it like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hey [Applause] as you know every time the four seasons complete their cycle we celebrate our festival of love according to our custom the boy who wins the contest will choose the companion he most desires and together they will pass a night of love how may the best man win [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] uh [Music] i'm ready to try good may luck be with you [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Music] uh [Music] i'm ready to try it go ahead and good luck [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do are you jealous [Music] what does that mean jealous jealousy means you can tell me some of the time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] oh [Music] hey [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] ceasefire [Music] enough of this playing around destroy the whole planet only shipped one force 10 mega ray my lord and we used it against excellent so we will be patient we'll hover in space above this point and wait eventually they will have to reveal themselves when they recharge the energy cells of their defensive shield they will momentarily lose their protection exactly now take us into space yes my lord center control gain altitude we were happy to accept you as our friends but since you've been with us so many strange things have happened that my people have turned against you and i am obliged to ask you to return to wherever you came from we come from another planet far away we were lost and were carried to this galaxy by pure chance we were trying to escape from our enemies now they've located us we have to leave they want to destroy us and they'll destroy you and your people we don't want to involve you in our battle with the king of the night if we go now he'll follow us and leave you alone if what you say is true then we cannot allow you to leave we will need you and your supernatural powers to defend us but you were right to try to get rid of us once we've left you won't be in any danger so let us go no never tie them up come take them [Music] we go to realize that if we hadn't considered you as friends we would have killed you already [Music] [Music] so [Applause] oh we're lucky our defensive shield is still functioning he must have known we were there it's a wonder he didn't destroy the whole planet it'll be a long trek before we re-enter our own galaxy well we don't have to worry about getting bored we did learn something from those people [Music] [Music] took away the fitter coldness from my face [Music] and it made me melt in your embrace made me tremble made me feel so very strange and made me want to feel again the touch of love then maybe i will walk into a brand new day and maybe i will find new things to say there's a fire deep inside when you touch me the way you do [Music] [Applause] made me tremble made me feel so very strange the touch of love then maybe i will walk into a brand new day and maybe i will find new things to say hold me once more touch me once more and love me once more [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] we have a contact you can see the ship on the space monitor [Music] what are they doing [Music] it's amazing when you think of the thousands of years we've wasted i don't understand why don't they try to avoid us they have nowhere to go my lord their planet is uninhabitable and their space station's destroyed which means they are destined to wander through space for eternity but i thought you wanted them destroyed too my lord i know but something happened to them on earth first i want to know what it is and then [Music] we must surrender what do you mean surrender sure i know we won't be able to do much not with only one spaceship but i'm not going to give up without a fight no only when i'm in the presence of the king will i be able to carry out my revenge revenge what do you mean after thousands of years our sexual powers have come back to life and we haven't suffered any harm on the contrary we've acquired a powerful new dimension i don't understand i must have them alive program the attack modules all modules assume delta formation surround the enemy spacecraft powerful king of the night you are the victor i'm ready to give myself up to you it's a very wise decision you had no other choice standby for docking bring her to the throne room and summon the other kings this is a great event prepare for boarding [Music] greetings bell star oh forgive me princess belle style you are finally in my power originally i planned to kill you but it would have been such a waste my heart would suffer too much to see you dead no you will live but as my slave to the end of time as for your courageous captain he too will enjoy my mercy he is condemned to force labor for the rest of his cosmic life but before i separate you let me show you what has happened to your planet jamal take us to excellent but what's fun the planet excellent is dead lifeless your father was stupid to resist me the other kings and emperors of the galaxy have recognized my power and are my loyal allies jamal bring them in keep on inside inside princess belle star enough of that before you pay for your sins you'll watch this slave come and kneel at my feet my lord before i dedicate my life holy to you please let me say my last goodbye to liffen got him [Music] [Applause] so oh my love i may live for thousands of years yet i swear to you my happiest moments were spent with you [Music] now that we've just begun to understand the real meaning of life we must part forever i'll never forget you [Music] i'll always love you [Music] [Applause] [Music] here i am my lord [Music] i'll activate the self-destruction systems go and tie them [Music] now that this horrendous world of evil has been destroyed forever i and the other dethroned kings will return to our planets what about you what will you do where will you go a planet is lost forever we have nowhere to go in this galaxy but we found a new life elsewhere [Music] [Applause] we want to return to the planet where we learn to be happy if you leave the galactic star ward you'll lose the gift of immortality you'll become vulnerable to sickness old age and death yes we know but love is worth it let's go we don't have much time get your spaceships [Music] bye [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] strange we've already passed through three galaxies and endless solar systems where is that planet there it is there it is [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] took away the bitter coldness from my face [Music] and it made me melt in your embrace made me tremble made me feel so very strange and made me want to see
