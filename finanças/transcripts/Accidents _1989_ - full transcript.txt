[♪♪♪] All right, all right. It flies very well. I'm very impressed. Now, can we have the microwave demonstration? [♪♪♪] MARK: It has an effective range of up to 100 yards. Beyond that, the microwaves can't be as accurately focused. Hm. But still lethal? If the exposure's prolonged. But even at the outside parameter of its range, the disruption of the neural electromagnetic activity is irreversible. In other words, complete vegetation. BERYL: We call it the Scout.HUGHES: Scout, eh? Very good. Great trademark potential. BERYL: It operates in two modes, allowing encephalic function to be paralyzed or terminated. [MACHINE BEEPING] Sensational. [♪♪♪] Its application is almost unlimited. With modifications, we think it could almost be group effective. It's gonna make a fortune. In the meantime, absolute security measures remain in effect. Okay? We all got it? Got it. MAN 1: Wonderful job, all of you. Absolutely terrific. I'm very proud. You know, this could turn out to be the most effective antiterrorist device ever invented. Look, I know how you feel, but there are no proprietary units at APT. All research belongs to the company. Tell that to Eric. Mark, no one tells Eric anything. We're not telling anybody anything. This is total security, this is you, me, Tom, period. [ERIC & REBECCA SINGING INDISTINCTLY] BOTH: ♪ Kookaburra sits On the old gum tree ♪ ♪ Merry merry king Of the bush is he ♪ ERIC: Hang on, honey! [BOTH PANTING] You okay? Honey? You okay?Yeah. You sure?Yeah. [REBECCA WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] [♪♪♪] There are several things which I have to know. First of all, why is it so expensive? It's a prototype. No one else knows about it. How does it work? Well, the engine's the first of its kind. It's application is, uh, one of superconductivity. And the killing beam works on an amplified brain scan system. When can I see it? Oh, we'll have a demo set up before we make the transfer. [♪♪♪] Hey, Becca, it's time to go, cookie. REBECCA: Coming, Daddy. Perfectly good tire to me, mate.Yeah, it was almost new. You got money coming your way, I reckon. Must've been defective.Yeah. Thanks for your help. Bye. Yeah, let's go, let's go. Ooh, you promised me a bite. [LAUGHING] Strawberry's my favorite. [REBECCA LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] No, you don't. Seatbelt. [ERIC GROWLS THEN REBECCA LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] ERIC: Ah, here's the old gum tree. We're home. You can tell we've been gone two weeks. Yeah. Let's get some windows open. Hi, guys. Miss me? We're back, Mom. MARK [ON RECORDING]: This is your fellow countryman, just calling to see if you're home safe and sound and, uh, listen, mate, as they say down here, we gotta talk. There's something I-- Shit, I don't wanna discuss it with your machine. Give me a call just as soon as you get in so I can confess my sins before you get to the lab tomorrow to find out anyway. Who knows, maybe we can go get drunk and you'll still be my friend. Bye. [KEYPAD BEEPS] [PHONE RINGING]Don't run in the house. I told you. You'll hurt yourself. JANE [OVER SPEAKER]: Hello?Hi, you guys. Hey, you're back. Yeah, we just walked in the door. Hi, Aunt Jane. How's my favorite girl? You survived the wilderness with Grizzly Adams? REBECCA: We saw lizards, snakes, all kinds of good stuff. Lizards and snakes? Hm, sounds like fun. Your father didn't let you starve, did he? Oh, no, we had hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans, potato chips and even pudding snacks. I see. A get back to nature trip, huh? The hot dogs were kosher.Dad. Mark, we'll be ready to eat in five minutes. Got you. Come on, let's go in the tub. I don't wanna go into the tub! So anyway, what's with Mr. Neurotic? JANE: What? When I got home, there's a message on my machine, sounds like a Woody Allen monologue. Oh, I don't know. Things have been pretty tense at the lab with that project he's been working on. ERIC: Whatever that is. Tell him Father Confessor returns his call. A baptism is about to take place. Mark? [♪♪♪] Mark?Jane, what's the matter? Mark!Jane! [ORGAN PLAYING SOMBER MUSIC] Jane, there's really not much to say. But on behalf of APT, I'd like to express our deepest sympathies. He was a great guy, it was a tragic loss. Thank you, Mr. Hughes. If there's anything I can do, anything at all... You'll be a big boy Johnny. I'm so sorry.Mrs. Hughes. I don't know what to say. Thank you for coming. Hi, John. He was a great guy. It's a sad loss. ERIC: I'll be right back. Hi, can I talk to you just for a sec? That's a hell of a way to end a vacation. I am sorry.Yeah, no, um... Was Mark okay when I was gone? Okay?Yeah, okay. I mean, I got a weird message on my answering machine. I didn't know what-- I mean, it was the night of his accident and he said something about work-- You know that I can't discuss anything like that. I'm not trying to get company secrets. My best friend's dead. I'm just trying-- I can tell you that everything at the lab is fine. Just fine. Oh. [SOBBING] You okay?Thank you. Take it easy, kiddo. Lorraine? Yeah. Honey, were you working on my microwave matrices while I was on vacation? Not me. That's weird. The last entry's on the 23rd. I was knee-deep in trout that day. Um... Oh, that's Dr. Fournace. Mark? Yeah, he was in here a couple of times. He had your access code. So I thought it was all right. [♪♪♪] [DOOR BUZZES] Sorry, Dr. Powers, off-limits. Not to me, it isn't. Sorry--Get your hand off me! [DOOR BEEPS] Security to control, this is Security Level 8. Dr. Powers has just passed through and is approaching. [♪♪♪] WOMAN [ON PA]: Dr. Powers, please report to security checkpoint. Dr. Powers, please report to security checkpoint. [♪♪♪] Powers! What the hell?!BERYL: Eric, get down! No! MAN [OVER RADIO]: Dr. Powers does not have clearance for your area. TOM: Get some men down here. Get your hands off me! What in God's name do you think you're doing? What do you think you're doing? Eric, you could've been killed. What you mean I could've--? Is this what you're doing with my work? Get him out of here. [♪♪♪] Gentlemen, I don't think it's necessary to restrain Dr. Powers any longer. Thank you, thank you. So Eric, what seems to be the problem? I wanna know who gave Mark Fournace access to my lab and I wanna know who gave him my terminal entry code. Well, I did, of course. Why? Drink, anyone? No?No, thank you. I have a nice, smooth bourbon. Hm? Scotch? It's after 5. I don't want your damn drink. I wanna know why you brought me all the way from the States to do neuro-physical research and you've got me working weaponry. I won't do it. Frankly, I don't know what your beef is. You know perfectly well, Eric, that everything we're doing here is company domain. ERIC: You're taking my life's work-- Work that I've always meant to diagnose people with, and to heal people with. --and you're telling me now that you're gonna use it to kill people? Not with me, you're not. Eric, excuse me, I think you're missing the point. Please sit down. We're part of a conglomerate. If work in applied sciences is some kind of crossover military resource we will explore it. This resource is tapped out. Eric, you're acting like a child. We're the good guys. We're doing what we have to do. Me too. So how much did he see? Obviously enough to understand its function. Knowing him, probably enough to know how it actually works. I'll go and talk to him. I wouldn't worry about it, he's blowing off steam. Besides, he's under contract. We have to get back to work. Beryl, uh, if you've got a couple of seconds, I'd like to talk to you. Two seconds. Sure. Go on, Tom. I'll be right there. See you later, Tom. I talked to my lawyer about a half an hour ago. He's filing papers before the end of the month. Does Barbara know? She will, believe me. [BOTH LAUGHING] [MOANING] [PHONE RINGING] Zimmer.HUGHES [OVER SPEAKER]: Warren, Eric Powers continues to be a real problem. He disrupted work in the Scout lab today. I want you to get on top of it. Okay? That shouldn't be a problem. Daddy? ERIC: Hi, sweetie pie. What's the matter, can't you sleep? I'm worried about you. I love you, Becca. There's nothing to worry about, you know? Then why are you so mad at the lab people? Uh, well, they kind of did something behind my back. They took some work of mine and they used it for something that I didn't know about. Was that something bad? You know in school when you take a piece of paper... Mm-hm. ...and you put a magnet under it and then you put some metal dust on top? What happens?It makes pretty patterns. Yeah. That's electromagnetic activity. And that's everywhere, it's in the air, it's in the ground, um, it's in our mind. It's part of the way our brain works. Okay. Now, what happens if you take two other magnets and put them next to each other? The dust all blows away? You're so smart. That's because the electromagnetic field is disrupted, is messed up sort of, you know? Do you remember two years ago when we came here? Hm.The people who brought us here, the company, they wanted me to work on some ideas that I had, that I really thought would help people someday a lot. It was sort of a way of, if their mind was sick, of healing it. You know, if it was, like, broken, fixing it. That doesn't sound bad. Oh, I know. But there are two sides to every coin, you know? And if you know how to fix something, you know how to break it. So they wanted to use your ideas to break people's minds instead of fix them? Yup. That's just about right, sweetie. I miss Uncle Mark, Daddy. [ERIC SIGHS] So do I, Becca. JANE: Eric.ERIC: Coming. Okay.Thanks. Where do you want it? Anywhere up there will do. When's the truck coming?Tomorrow morning. Our plane's at 4 p.m. So how you doing? All right, I guess. Little Mark is not so hot, though. I keep hoping he'll be better when we get back to the States. I'm afraid that's when it's really gonna hit me. Janie. When was the last time you had the Jacuzzi serviced? Oh, God, I can't remember. Probably not since the baby got here. Mark was the only one who ever used the damn thing. He was always tinkering with it, though. He was... I just can't believe it happened. Mark was so meticulous about everything. He was so good at that kind of stuff. I know. I know. Bye, honey. See you later. I've gotta call in at the store first but I'll be back on time. [♪♪♪] [ENGINE STARTS] [♪♪♪] [DOG BARKING] MAN: Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for Tom Black. He's not here.I can see that. Can you tell me where he is?

[SOBBING]What's the matter, honey? Tom Black, he's dead. What are you talking about? Tell me about it. They found his car, what's left of it. That ocean drive. Lost control. ERIC: Oh, no. [SOBBING] The car went completely out of control? As far as we know, right into the wall. It is an absolute tragedy.[PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yes, she's right here, one moment. Hello. Okay, I'll take it in my office. Hang on a moment. I'll just transfer you to her office. Eric? ERIC: I need to see you.What is it? Well, I don't really wanna talk about it over the phone. I'd rather see you in person. Please, not now. It's about Mark and Tom and that little toy you guys are making. Eric, do you enjoy making trouble? No, Beryl, but I enjoy knowing what the truth is. I mean, everybody seems a little overeager to write Tom and Mark off as accidents, you know? Oh, and you're not? Well, I mean, think about it. You're working in a very sensitive, top-secret department. And, uh, only Mark and Tom and you know about it. You're forgetting yourself. That's right. And half of us are dead. So you feel lucky today? What the hell do you mean? Beryl, listen. Rebecca and I had an accident on the way back from Lake George. I mean, we barely got out of it unhurt. What's that make you think? Listen to me. I know we're not the best of friends, okay? But I really wanna talk to you. The railway station. You know, downtown? It's near the plant. About 5? I must be out of my mind. That's probably a good sign, all things considered. This better not take long. I'll see you there. [♪♪♪] MAN [ON PA]: The track to Perisher will be leaving from Platform B2 in four minutes.

I wanna know which side you're on. Side? What side? Look, I waited for you for over an hour last night. Oh, yeah?Yeah. The only APT employee that I saw there last night was that Nazi chief of security, Zimmer. What? I figured you asked him to join us. Look, I'm a slow starter in the morning, Powers. You wanna share the rules of this game so I can play too? You bet. We'll talk while you drive.Excuse me? It's okay. I'm going your way. I have no idea what you think I know or don't know, but I did not tell Zimmer about last night. What about your buddy Hughes? That's out of bounds, pal. Okay, I'll dress it up this way. If you didn't tell Zimmer about last night, who did? I don't know.And if Mark Fournace, Tom Black and that nasty weapon of yours had nothing to do with this, what was the head of security doing following us last night? [TIRES SCREECH] It's okay, I'm getting out here. Listen, wait a minute, my jacket. Mark wasn't a careless man, neither was Tom Black. I'd keep an eye over my shoulder if I were you.

Yeah, well, he did attack one of my security guards around the restricted area the day that he quit. Look, you're not suggesting that there's anything fishy about his wife's death, are you? Hi, Carl. I'm sorry, Dr. Powers, you know your access to the facilities has been canceled. What, are you kidding me? I just wanna go and talk to Hughes. Would you call him on the phone, please? Okay, Dr. Powers. I'll try his office. I have Dr. Powers in the gate. He wants to come in to meet Mr. Hughes. Thank you. I'm sorry, Dr. Powers, Mr. Hughes already left the complex. His secretary said you could leave a message but I'm sorry, I can't let you pass. Listen, I've left a dozen messages. I'm sorry, sir. Uh, I've gotta... Do you mind? Thank you. Why did Powers resign? Who knows? He was a hothead when he joined us and he still is. Heard some arguments with both of them and this Beryl Chambers. What was all that about? Yeah. Was something about somebody stealing a couple of ideas of his or something. What kind of ideas? Were they worth anything? Look, I can't discuss company business. You've got his employment records. The rest is a security matter. But, uh, we don't think he was a hothead enough to kill the both of them. Any idea why he was fired from Applied Electronics six months before he came here? Yeah, something about somebody stealing his ideas again. What, is he some sort of a psycho? You know what these crazy scientists are like, heh. [♪♪♪] [ALL CHATTERING] Oh, Beryl. Oops. Sorry.

Come in, come in. Good to see you. You're a sight for sore eyes. What can I do for you? Actually, it's important that I talk to you. I've been trying to reach you. I left messages with your secretary-- Hello. Beautiful to see you. Beautiful party. Thank you. Thank you. Eric, Sheryl. Sheryl, Eric. How do you do. Have you seen Barbara? Uh, last time I saw she was headed upstairs. Listen, it's a little bit difficult for me to talk about business right now. Can I have my secretary call you in the morning, set up an appointment? I'm sorry, I don't think it'll wait till morning. Can you spare a minute now? Of course. Um, come this way. There's little breakfast nook around here. Here, we can find some privacy. Anthony. Is this the little lady?Brenda, meet Jim. Hello, Brenda. Nice to see you. Both of you enjoy yourselves. I'll see you tomorrow. Please. Dom Pérignon?Okay, okay. Take a seat. Something to eat? Uh, no. Well, no. I think there's something going on with Warren Zimmer that you should check into. Something like what? Well--Cigar? No, no, no. Um... I'm not quite sure yet. I asked Beryl Chambers to meet me, I wanted to talk to her about Mark and Tom Black. Zimmer followed us. Uh-huh. Well, did it occur to you that maybe he was doing his job? Ms. Chambers is working in a very sensitive department. And you, my boy, are no longer working for APT. But I'm not the one who's hanging out with functionaries of the Bulgarian mission. Bear with me a second, okay? I followed Zimmer last night. And he met with some character at a restaurant down by the harbor. Half an hour later, the same guy is driving through the front gates of the Bulgarian embassy like he owns the place. What I'm trying to say is, you have two employees of APT, okay, both working, as you put it, in a very sensitive department. Dead by unusual accidents. You've got a chief of security who is having tête-à-têtes with a representative of terrorism incorporated. If you put these together you paint-- Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you were busy. Busy. Are we busy? Actually, we're having a little tête-à-tête. I'm trying to convince this boy to come back into the fold and not being terribly successful. I'm sorry to hear that. I'll see you later.Enjoy. Thank you. Anyway, like I was saying--Come on, let's take a walk. Show you the pool. Listen, Eric, I understand your concern about Tom and Mark. But do you have anything at all? Any evidence? I don't know about evidence but if you take the facts and you look at them the way that I've set them up, you're gonna come to the same conclusion. I've known Warren Zimmer since we served in Korea, since 1952. [JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Oh, hello. Hi. Hi, Warren. Barbara, my dear. You look absolutely stunning, as usual. Oh, thank you. I'll promise you one thing. I'll talk to him tomorrow. If there's anything wrong, anything untoward, you'll be the first to know. Hm? I didn't mean to barge in. I didn't know you were entertaining. Didn't barge in, trust me. It's great to see you. Listen, we've got tons of food. Are you sure you won't stay? No, my kid's at home, I gotta get back. Great to see you. Thank you for coming.

Eric, what is it? Listen, I don't want anybody to know where Becca is. I'm betting they won't look here. Who's they? Zimmer. One of his pals, they tried to kill us tonight. They tried to kill me and my little girl. They tried to kill me and my little girl. It was meant to look like an accident. All the gas jets in the stove were turned up full, all the windows were closed all through the house. They even set up a nice little booby-trap so in case I woke up and went for fresh air, tried to save my kid or something. I figure I've got a couple of hours before they realize they missed. Eric, your story keeps getting crazier and crazier. I don't know what to believe anymore. You don't have to believe anything, just please take care of my little girl. Of course I will. [SIGHS] Thanks. Uh, is there anything scheduled for Scout in the next 48 hours? Any tests, any demonstrations, anything at all? No, nothing that I'm aware of. But then, there's a lot that I'm not aware of these days. That's okay. That's good. I got some time. Don't worry. Be happy. What are you going to do? I'm gonna try to buy some time. And then I'm gonna blow the lid off this thing. What thing?I don't know yet, but it's all tied together. Mark and Tom, all connected. And where am I going to find you? You're not. That way, if anybody questions you, you won't be able to tell them anything. Oh, God, Eric.Hey. Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. Daddy promises. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay.

GEORGE: Yes. Could you follow us, please? Mr. Powers, we've been doing some checks through our military attaché and-- Frankly, sir, no one is aware of any project even remotely similar to this one you've referred. This, this... They call it Scout project, I'm telling you it exists. Two people who were involved project at APT are dead. They've been murdered.Mark Fournace and Tom Black. Yeah. And now they wanna add me to the list. This way, please. Follow us. Mr. Powers, have a seat, please. Mr. Powers, you, uh, knew Mark Fournace? Yeah, he was my best friend. GEORGE: And Jim Black?Uh-huh. You were at Jim Black's house the weekend he died? It's Tom Black.Tom Black, sorry. Yeah, but, wait a minute, what's going on here? I thought you guys didn't know anything about this. We don't know anything about a project named Scout. What about Black? I wanted to talk to him. I didn't know he was away. Talk to him about what? About Mark's accident, about Scout. Mr. Powers, you are no longer employed by APT. I resigned.Any particular reason? Yeah, I didn't like the way they did business. Fournace and Black?No, not Fournace-- Do you think I could have a cup of coffee or something? Did Mark Fournace ever ask you to do any work around his house, perhaps yard work, anything like that? Wait a minute, you guys. I don't know where you're coming from, but Mark Fournace was the best aeronautical engineer I ever met. I mean, why would he want me to help him? Mr. Powers, your fingerprints, according to police files, have been found on the lights around Mr. Fournace's Jacuzzi. Wait a minute. You think I killed Mark? [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] Mr. Powers, if you'll have a seat, I'm sure I can straighten this out in a few minutes. [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] Relax. It won't be but a minute. Mr. Powers.

Can't say that I blame you, I'm not much of a breakfast person, myself, heh. [SIGHS] May I see your picture?Yeah. This is very good. You're very good.Thank you. And is this your mother? I don't remember her, so I keep the picture to remind me. Oh. She died a long time ago, when I was a baby. I'm sorry. What happened? Daddy said she had a cerebral vascular incident. A stroke. She's very young. He thinks it was his fault. Not like he did it or anything, but you know when something happens for no reason and you can't figure out why, you think maybe you could've stopped it. You know what I mean?Yes, I think I do. [♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] MAN: Newsroom.Let me talk to Harold Drummer. Drummer! Just a second. Drummer, it's for you.

That's me, mate. I'm Powers. Powers? Uh-huh. Eric Powers? What can I do for you? I thought you'd like to know what's really going on at APT instead of that stuff you put in the paper this morning. What are you talking about? I think I've got a story for you that will win you the Pulitzer Prize. I'm listening. No. You can take credit for the break, but I want to go public with this. I want television, I want radio, I want the whole works, okay? And I want an outside location, somewhere near your offices, I want no police and I want no one, absolutely no one from APT. How do I know you really got something? How do I know you're even the real Eric Powers? You don't. It's, uh, gonna take a little time. You've got till noon. [SIGHS] Look, it's being handled. As soon as he surfaces, I'll nail him. Excuse me Mr. Zimmer, it's for you. It's been forwarded through from your office. Zimmer. Bye for now.MAID: Bye, madam. Time to leave, Jim.Hmm. Bye, now.

HUGHES [OVER SPEAKER]: Good. What time shall I pick you up? BERYL: I don't think that tonight is gonna work out. HUGHES: What's the matter? Well, I'm feeling very tired and, uh... Actually, I don't think I'd be very good company. Um, you know, uh, I think it would be very good for me to go out tonight. That's more like it. Look, I'll make reservations at La Tierra. Should we say about 7? I can pick you up. BERYL: I'll meet you there.Fine. See you then. Bye, darling. [♪♪♪] Harold Drummer. Yeah, tell him it's his Pulitzer Prize. You're early. Hello? Hello, Powers, are you there? HUGHES: I understand your point of view, Warren, but I'm simply not willing to do that. You understand? No, it must be done now. Well, it's not going to be delivered now, so he's just gonna have to wait. Hello, hello, please make yourself comfortable in my office. Two seconds, I'll be right there. ZIMMER: He'll blow a gasket if we change it now. HUGHES: Look, don't you think I'm as anxious to collect their money as you are? It's too chancy now. ZIMMER: I keep trying to tell you, he'll go through the bloody roof if we change the plan now. HUGHES: Believe it or not, I'm not particularly concerned about his emotional well-being, or his employer's, or yours, for that matter. I'm calling the shots here. And I'm going to be happy. Which means the transfer is not going to take place until things calm down here and the spotlight is off APT. Got it? [♪♪♪] [TAXI DISPATCH RADIO CHATTERING] MAN: Can you pull up over there, please? [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [DOOR CLOSES] Taxi?No, sorry. WAITER: Good evening, Mr. Hughes. Is everything satisfactory? Everything was terrific, thank you, Michael. And please bring me the check as soon as you can. Thank you. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] HUGHES: If madam will permit me, madam is looking very beautiful tonight. Thank you.Perhaps madam would have just a touch of champagne? [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] For the sweet. I love you. To us. To our great escape. Why do you keep calling it that? Because that's what it is. Sounds so romantic. And what's wrong with romantic? Because it's not realistic. I'll tell you what I'll do. If you'll take a check, I'll give you $250,000 to tell me what's going on with you tonight. Oh, Jim. Nothing's going on with me tonight. Sure. Okay. Let's go home. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Jim, I'm going to take a taxi. BERYL: Where are you going? Give me a break, where am I going? I'm taking you home. Where do you think I'm going?What about your car? The hell with my car, I'll pick my car up later. I'll take the cab back and pick it up. I'm not gonna let the evening end this way. Hey, 43 Com-- [♪♪♪] 43 Compton Road. Jim, I'd like to explain.HUGHES: No. Don't explain. Don't explain. Driver. Darling.Jim. I don't think it's a good idea if you come up this evening. Are you sure?Yes. I'm sure. Just say good night. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I love you. Where's my daughter? Where is Rebecca? She's here. It's all right.I've been calling you for hours. She's next door with my friend! You're hurting me.Where is she? BERYL: You're hurting me.ERIC: Why did you leave? I had to go. I couldn't get out of it. He would've been suspicious and I wasn't gonna let him come here. You're out of line.Just show me my kid. BERYL: You'd better just calm down. Hi, Susan.Hi. BERYL: Everything all right? She's a great girl. We've had a lot of fun. Satisfied?Uh, I'm Rebecca's father, would it be possible if she stayed just a little bit longer with you? No, I don't think it's all right if we impose on Susan. It's no problem. She can stay all night. Great, I'll be back to pick her up soon. Thanks. Come on. Hughes is in on it. What are you talking about? From the beginning, with Zimmer. In on what? The cab driver who brought you here tonight, he's a terrorist. Are you out of your mind? No. I've seen him before, with Zimmer. He works at the Bulgarian Consulate. I told Hughes about it the night of his party. He acted like there was nothing going on. You're going to have to be more specific. Scout. All of this has to do with the Scout project. Okay, let me see if I'm getting this straight. Hughes said to you that he'd leave his wife, right? That he'd take you away. I'm sorry but none of that is any of your business. These people are trying to kill me, it's my business. Okay? Forgive me, but I don't know what he said to you. Maybe he said he was gonna smother you in luxury, maybe he said you'd get you everything you always wanted in your life, or that you would be rich enough to travel all over the world, anyplace you ever wanted to go. How am I doing, Beryl? How is he gonna pull this off? He is a mid-level executive at APT, how? I'll tell you how. He's gonna sell the Scout and he's gonna sell it to terrorists and he's gonna sell it for a whole lot of money. I don't believe that. We are the only people who know about this. They can cover their tracks, nobody will ever know Scout existed. Mark is dead, Tom is dead. They missed me but they're gonna turn me into the fall guy and you're off with Hughes. Stop it.It's the only explanation that makes any sense. We've gotta something. And I need your help. What do you want me to do? Hang up the goddamn phone, Warren! Your objections are of no concern at this moment. But perhaps this will help justify the inconvenience. You were supposed to use the account in Switzerland. I do not like the Swiss. This was not the arrangement. That was my idea, Hughes. I wanted to see the money. Warren, it's not the right time now, it's too goddamn risky. Open the safe, Hughes. Yes, Mr. Hughes, please. Do as he says. I'll only be a few minutes, Wayne. I left some work in the lab that I need. Okay, Miss Chambers. Thanks. [ERIC SIGHS] Hold on, we got company.What? No. Miss Chambers, Mr. Zimmer would like to see you. Mr. Zimmer? What about?He didn't say, but he would like you to join him in the complex. I'm in a hurry. Please tell Mr. Zimmer I'll handle it on Monday morning. Miss Chambers, would you please come with us? This way, please. I would like a demonstration. Please. You guys are gonna be very sorry Monday morning. Take her keys and go and check her car. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] MAN 1: Anything?MAN 2: Nothing here. MAN 3: Come on. [♪♪♪] Very impressive. My compliments to your people. BERYL: Take your hands off me. What the hell are you doing here? Jim. [♪♪♪] I would like to see how it really works. I just showed you how it really works. Oh, Jesus Christ, you're not gonna use it on people. You can't-- You don't need to use it on people! People, animals, it's exactly the same thing. Beryl, right? [♪♪♪] [SPORTS GAME CHATTERING ON RADIO] Hey, David. Who's this? DAVID: That's Powers, the guy they're looking for. Damn, how the hell did he get on the grounds? Listen, call Zimmer, I'm gonna go check him out. Right. [♪♪♪] Please. Oh, my God, no. [GASPS] I would like to test it myself. All we need is a subject. God, Warren, what the hell's the matter with you? Makes perfect sense to me. No! Oh, God! Jim! No! [GROANING]Jim! God! No! Oh! No! Jim, Jim. Very impressive. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Jim. Powers, freeze! Powers, damn you. Powers! Put up your hands and come out. Slowly. [FIRE ALARM WAILING] Don't! Unh! [GRUNTING] MAN [ON PA]: I repeat, intruder is armed. Attention all units, security breach, Lab Level 4. All units, channel 4 communication. [GRUNTS] Repeat, intruder is armed. GUARD:Go, go! That way. [SIREN WAILING] GUARD: Cover that door. [♪♪♪] Get after the bloke with the black briefcase. Move it! [♪♪♪] [SIREN WAILING] [♪♪♪] [SIREN WAILING] Come on, we're a bit old for playing games, aren't we? [DOOR CLOSES] [ERIC GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] GUARD: Zimmer! [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [GROANS] [GUNFIRE] [GROANS] [♪♪♪] GUARD: Cover me. [ALL GROAN] [♪♪♪] GUARD: Keep moving that way! [BOTH GRUNTING] Powers! [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [♪♪♪] [GROANING] [♪♪♪] [GROANING] [BOTH PANTING] Oh.Thanks. [♪♪♪] Let's go. [♪♪♪] BERYL: Okay! Ha-ha! ERIC: You sure you're ready for this, huh? REBECCA: Don't worry, I'll look after her. BERYL: Oh, good.[ENGINE STARTS] ERIC: Fasten up your seatbelt. [♪♪♪]
