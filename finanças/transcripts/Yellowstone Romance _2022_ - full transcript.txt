So this box still needs to be labeled. And then these will be wrapped as a series of three. Oh! No, no, no. No. That piece stays here. It's just the Michaud and the Vasquez that need packing. And please wrap them tight. No wiggle room. Okay? Hey, it's me. Hey, Liv. Just calling to check in to make sure everything's on schedule? As long as the carrier's not late, I will be on the plane by 3:00 and back in time for Thai night. Great, because I have some news. What is it? I'll tell you when you get here. I've got to go, but I will see you at home. You can't leave me hanging like that. Amber. All right, we can't be late, so let's get these on the truck. Hey! Amber, I'm home. I'll be right out. Sorry if the food got cold. My flight got delayed. By the way, I officially hate my job. You hated it before you left. This last tour confirmed it. I'm essentially a UPS service for the gallery. Hey, maybe that's what I should do. Deliver mail here in the neighborhood. Then I wouldn't have to miss out on my latte from Jump start or my best friend in the whole world. Or you could work on your art. I don't want to talk about that. What I do want to talk about is your news. Hold that thought. It's open. Why? Is that Justin? He'd better not know this news before me. - Hey! - Hey. Liv, you remember Dylan, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. You two were, like, hanging out before I left. Yeah, yeah. It's good to see you again, Olivia. And, ooh, I see the food has arrived. Dylan's been joining me for Thai night while you've been away. Oh. That's great. You haven't told her? Told me what? Um... As you may recall, Dylan's been in New York sourcing some new equipment suppliers, but now he has to go back to his ranch in Wyoming, and... he asked me to go with him! Is that? Are you? We are. We're engaged! Hi. Excuse me. Dylan. Dylan? Hi. Do you mind just giving us several moments alone, please? Yeah. Yeah. Babe, I'll go for a walk around the block. Thank you. Amber, you two met, like, four weeks ago. Six. Okay, and, you know, it was all casual because he wasn't staying, and... Then I go away for three weeks, and I come back and you're engaged. I didn't plan on falling head over heels for him, but I did, and honestly? This is the most excited I've been in, like, forever. So please, please be happy for me. Of course, I'm happy for you. Come here. Thank you. You totally got that. I know. I totally did. You are so not happy for her. Well, of course not. But what can I say? She asked me to be her maid of honor. Well, you two are like sisters. Exactly. Sisters don't just spring it on you that they're getting married and moving away to go live on a ranch. Plus, we're city girls. This is what we do. We hang out here, we go to yoga, we get coffee and takeout, and we talk about all the amazing things we're going to do one day. Well, as unhappy as you are, you still have to plan a bachelorette party. So... what about, like, a Western theme? Seriously? If Amber wants to go live on a ranch, she needs to know it's not going to be all cute boots and hats. I mean, they have black widow spiders that live in Wyoming. That girl can't handle anything creepy-crawly, so how's that for a reality check? Oh, my gosh. That's it. What? As maid of honor, I am in charge of planning a sendoff, so I am going to plan not just a party but a surprise bachelorette getaway. One that will show Amber what a big mistake she's making. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Okay, Liv. We're at the airport. Are you finally going to tell us where the surprise trip is? Check your phones. I just sent the itineraries. Dude ranch? That's right. Surprise. Is this not the most epic bachelorette getaway ever? Because seriously, dude ranches are hot right now. Oh. It is busy season, but lucky for us, they just opened their doors to the public. Sure, but, I mean, you could have at least told me so I didn't pack all of my heels. Sorry, but you're going to have to get used to that. Seeing as you won't need all your cute heels once you live in the country. But I'm sure we can get you some boots on the way. Oh. I just Googled, and Yellowstone Airport has a Western boutique. They've got cowboy hats. Ooh. Ooh, they even have spurs. See? We're all set. All right, let's giddy-up. Oh, my gosh. This dude ranch is amazing. Welcome to Big Sky. I'm Wade McCleary. Nice to meet you, Mr. McCleary. I'm Olivia, and these are my friends, Amber and Justin. It's a pleasure, and please, call me Wade. I've brewed up some fresh iced tea. Okay. Mm, mm, mm. Now, doesn't that taste just like a country day? Oh, there's my boy now. What? Thanks. Travis, our guests have arrived. This here is Olivia, Amber, and Justin. Nice to meet y'all. These folks came all the way from... Where is it you came from? New York City. The Big Apple. So... any of you ever live or work out in the country before? Oh, heck no, but Amber here is getting married and moving to a ranch. Probably just like this one. So no experience, then, riding horses or handling cattle? Let's put it this way. The only experience we have is dressing up for the pub's Western-themed Halloween party. Are those the clothes you wore? Oh, is this not... I think we've got the picture that these here folks are in for a new and exciting adventure. And seeing as you're our very first guests, so are we. Am I right, Travis? Yeah, actually, I have been horseback riding before. I took lessons. - Really? - Yeah. When? Those two summers I went to Camp Washonagin when you were in summer school. Well, that's something. Right, Travis? I guess so. Now, how about you graciously show our guests to their lodgings? Of course. Follow me. Okay. Here you are. Ooh, rustic chic. I like it. Are these handmade? Yeah, by my mom and grandmother. Authentic. That is exactly what we want. All right. Well, you've got a few amenities. Radio, coffee maker... And the ladies' room would be... That door right there. Ah. Phew. I was a bit worried we might have an outhouse. We're not totally in the Dark Ages, but since you're asking, the shower is outdoors. But don't worry. It's completely private. Yeah, and Wi-Fi? Because I have to get in touch with my fiancé. Oh, my gosh, fiancé. It sounds so weird. Well, it kind of is. She got engaged in, like, four weeks. Six... weeks, actually. Now I'll leave y'all to get settled. But dinner should be ready shortly. You'll be notified by the dinner bell. So unless there's anything else I missed... Well, how about a tour? You know, of the ranch, so we can get a lay of the land. Oh, sure. Yeah, I'm going to have to take a rain check on that until after I call Dylan. I'm out, too. I've got to put my feet up after wearing these bad boys all day. I guess it's just me and you, cowboy. Sorry. Is that politically not correct, or... I'll meet you out by the corral. Yes, sir. Is it just me, or is he a bit rough? If you mean prickly as a cactus out here, then yeah. Citiots. I'm guessing this is the corral. Hey there. You're pretty as a picture with those big old soft eyes. That's it. You want to take a picture with me? Wait, I don't see you. Here, I'll just move this way a little bit. Whoa! Oh... Need a hand? Yeah. Thanks. That's good. So I guess you figured out here's where we keep the cows and Cyclone the bull. Cyclone? Because he can be a bit... unpredictable. Right. So are these all the cows you have? Most are out to pasture. Then what else other than the corral? Well, we keep the horses in the barn over there. Hen coops are just in behind it. And we keep the pigs over in that barn. So... other than 10,000 acres of land, this here's about it. So we're your first guests, huh? That's right. My dad put the ranch up on... Trippy? Or Tripster? TripAdvisor? Sure. Whatever. I can see that this whole hospitality thing is kind of new to you. Ha. Saved by the dinner bell. Well, thank you for pointing everything out, and I guess I will see you at dinner. Which is... Outside the farmhouse. I'll see y'all there. Thank you. Wow, those were some serious steaks. I guess I should have asked if any of you are vegetarian. None here. Good thing, because out here, we fuel up on meat, meat, and more meat. Keeps us going from dawn till dusk. And speaking of days on the ranch, is that what one should expect living like this? I mean, getting up at dawn and working on chores all day until dusk? Well, that's about right, wouldn't you say, Travis? Pretty much. Wow. So I guess vacations are out of the question. Like my grandpa used to say, "If you want to be a rancher, you've got to stay home and do the work." Wow. Sounds tough. Definitely a way of life. So what's on the itinerary? I mean, we are celebrating a soon-to-be bride. Maybe some games or some trail riding? Do you have a pool? Uh, no. No pool. But we do have a river that runs through our property. I'm sure we could plan an outing out there if we all manage to finish what needs to get done around here. Wait. Is this another bachelorette surprise? I'm actually talking about chores. Huh? Because y'all booked a working dude ranch. You know that, right? Working? What does that mean, exactly? Well, it means fun. Getting your hands dirty, your boots scuffed up. So you're saying we're actually working the ranch? That is the experience you signed up for on a "working" dude ranch. Partaking in all the things that make a place like this run as smooth as a cattle drive. Did I not tell you guys that this is a working dude ranch? No. No, you did not. Then, in that case, Amber's right. It is another surprise. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll find your stay here will be more than memorable. Right, Travis? No doubt. I mean, what better way than to get our bride-to-be ready for her new life? Am I right? This is amazing. It's so kind of you. Well, that's what best friends are for. Well, here. A toast, then. To gettin' 'er done. Starting tomorrow at the crack of dawn. Maybe we should just call it a night. Yeah, good idea. What? What is it? Am I late for work? It is time to get up. Let the bachelorette festivities begin. Right. Yeah. I'm up. Are you up? That's great. I'm totally up. Uh. What? What's going on? Why is it still dark out? I don't know if this was such a good plan. Turning this place into some kind of hotel. Like, we're ranchers, Dad, not event planners. Look, I know you haven't been keen on the idea, but it's a way to bring in more cash, and right now that's what we need. So look at the bright side. I guess. I just wish Mom were here. Because she'd be so much better at all this. But hey, at least you're broadening your horizons and getting to know some new and interesting folks. Definitely interesting. You all right? Please tell me there's hot water. Of course. It just takes a little while to heat up and travel out this way. But I've got to warn you, it's a small tank, so you want to have a quick shower so there's enough for all three of you. Okay. So are you good? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Well, when you're done, I'll meet you over at the barn Mm-hmm. All right. How was the shower the second time around? It was... better. Where are Amber and Justin? They're off with my dad filling the troughs. - Ah. - You and I are on eggs. Just make sure you ignore the rooster. You don't want to ruffle his feathers. What will he do? Protect his turf. Now, we like to collect eggs twice a day. Once early, and then again later to help keep the nests clean. So here, why don't you collect what we've got? And be careful. This is part of breakfast. Got it. So what do you do in the city? I'm a registrar for the Norton Art Gallery. It sounds a lot fancier than it is. You always done that? Oh, gosh, no. I've been a theater usher. That was while I was in college. Then I worked as a receptionist for the Museum of Art. And then I worked at another art gallery before I landed the registrar job. So I'm guessing you enjoy the arts? Well, maybe not packing them with duct tape, but yeah, I do. I'm guessing you've always done this? Ranching? Yep. Born and raised. Actually, I've never lived outside of Main and Seventh. What is that, about seven square blocks? - About that. - Huh. So seven square blocks is, let's see, it's about 482 acres. Yeah? And out here, we've got over 10,000. Sounds to me like your world in the big city isn't really all that big. This is all just... land. I mean, we've got so much. Like this little coffee shop on the corner that makes the most incredible lattes. And then our local pub right down the street. And the best place to get a mani-pedi. This is all really nice, but it's just, you know. Nope. I don't. Looks like your friend's settling in. Well, that's just because so far, it's been like a petting zoo. I mean, when do we get really down and dirty? It's coming. Okay. Oh, don't put it up there. It's not very... Oh! Stable. All right, folks. Unfortunately, this morning, we don't have any eggs. But there's still plenty to eat, so double up, and then we'll get to work. I mean, it's probably a good thing we don't have any eggs. I think we've got enough saturated fats here to last a lifetime, right? How are the new recruits? Or should I say guests? Just what I thought. That good, huh? I'll help you whip them into shape. I figured I could count on you. Always. When you've had enough to eat, I'll meet y'all at the barn so you can get to know your horses. Great. All right. Oh, and mucking the stalls is really no big deal. Oh, look. Horses. You three ready to ride? Gang, this is Kat. She's been my right hand on the ranch since I can remember. And sometimes his left. All right. Amber, this here'll be your horse, Blaze. Don't worry. She's not as fast as her name, but she handles well. And Toro can be yours. Toro? Like, as in bull? He's a bit stubborn, that's all. Where's my horse? Right over there. This here's Daisy. She's beautiful. And that mane! Girl, we need to talk conditioners to make that shine. All right, then. How about we hop on and get a feel for riding, seeing as at the end of the week, we've got a cattle drive to conquer. I'm sorry. A what? Cattle drive. You know, when you round up all the cattle and lead them out to pasture for the season? And you want us to do that? It is what needs to get done around here, so... yeah. I'm game. - Let's get practicing. - Yeah. Let's do it. Yeah. Just put your foot in the stirrup. - Here, I'll help. - I'm trying. I just can't... Okay. Okay. - There you go. - Yep, okay. And hang on to the reins with the other hand. - You got it? - Mm-hmm. There you go. Great job. Thanks. I think I can... Okay. - There you go. Okay. - Okay. Okay. All right. Are you good? - Yeah. - You're good. All right. Now if you're ready, we'll go for a bit of a trail ride. Kat'll take the rear so none of y'all will wander off, and I'll take the lead. Okay, but hear me out. I'm really thinking if her mane was on the right, it would really frame her face a lot better. Yes, yes. This is stunning. Good girl, Daisy! Do you think you could take a few photos for us? Uh, yeah. Sure. So I'm curious. What would make you turn your family ranch into, like, a vacation spot? It was actually my dad's idea. He just thought it would be great to share all this with folks like you. What does that mean, folk like me? You know, people who don't know anything about... well, all this. Right. And did you think it was a good idea? What was that? Wolves. Don't worry. They won't bother us. I think it's a good idea if I go and get that cow and her new calf from the north pasture. All right, listen up. Seeing as this is your first lesson in riding, we're just going to sit tight and let Kat head out to the north pasture. Sounds good to me. No, no, no, no, no. This is what we came here for, right? To dig into ranch life and learn what it's really like. So come on. Let's giddy-up and do this. - No, Olivia! - Olivia, don't! Stay here. What is it? Olivia. You all right? Yeah. I just... I couldn't hang on anymore. Don't worry. We'll take it nice and slow on the ride back. Oh, no, no, no. I am not getting back on that horse right now. No way. All right, then. Looks like we're walking back. It was just like Manhattan on a Friday night. And then, I cut to the right of the cows, but it charged in the opposite direction. But I got a hold of it, and I drove it back to the others. I mean, do we really have to hear all day about how she wrangled, like, one cow? I mean, there's all this tack that needs cleaning, so... Why don't you leave that, and I'll show y'all how we release tension from the day. Great. Uh, Amber, I'm going to help you with this tack. So let me guess. Now it's time to chop wood? Nope. We are going to throw these at that target. Oh. Kind of like darts. Kinda. Well then, you are in for a surprise because we play every weekend at McCool's, and I've got to say, I'm pretty good. All right, champ. Have at 'er. So why do I get the feeling you don't want your friend, Amber, to get the hang of all this? Well, there's nothing to tell. Except that my best friend is getting married and moving to a ranch, so I just thought that bringing her here would be like a test run. Well, I won't argue if you're having your doubts. What's that supposed to mean? You three are from the city, so... This might not be your thing. Really? Well then, watch this. Hmm. Not bad. Meh. It was okay. So... what does your friend, Amber, do in the city? She's an insurance broker. But she hates her job just as much as I do. What do you want to be doing? Well, if I could pick my dream job, I would be an artist, but that's crazy. Like leaving insurance to go live on a ranch? Yes, exactly. Except your friend's giving it a shot, so what if you did? Well, I did. I brought one of my paintings to the gallery I work at, and Demetrie Faust, who is one of my favorite artists, said that it looked "amateur". Hmm. Well... for what it's worth, you did all right out there today. Thanks, but now you're just saying things. If you fall off your horse, you've just got to pick up the reins and get back in the saddle. Otherwise, you'll never be able to ride. I am so sorry. Hey, Dad. Hey, son. City folk. Hey, your dad sent me out here to do some fencing work. I guess that's what you're doing? Yep. Not exactly exciting, but necessary. Here. Why don't I show you how it's done? Uh, I may be from the city, but I think I know how to hammer a nail. All right. See? Ta-dah. Why would you do that? Because the fencing has to be good and secure or else an animal can get through it. Here. So the beautiful thing about fencing is that you can do it on your own. It's like a seesaw effect. You get the one side in, and then you lift it up on the other. Go ahead. Drive it straight through and into the post. There you go. Not bad. And I'm not just saying that. Is this all you've ever done? Ranching? Yep. Hmm. Do you ever find that doing the same thing day in and day out, it gets a little, I don't know, boring? I mean, it doesn't seem like you have a lot of time for fun. We have our ways. Besides, I like what I do. What about you? What do you do for fun, other than darts at this McCool's place? Oh, we do lots of things. Every Friday, Amber and I order in Thai from this amazing takeout place. Mondays, we go to the meditation lab for yoga. Wednesdays is movie night, and Thursdays we do laundry. Sounds to me like you do the same things day in and day out. Well, call me boring, but today's Monday. And that means topping up the manure. We can come back to this later. Look, why don't I just stay here and work on this? I don't think you're ready to tackle all this fencing. Of course I am. All right. Knock yourself out. Great. So how much exactly do you need me to do? Well, you see how the fence carries on down the pasture? Yep. So what you want to do is just keep following it along and keep fixing it until there isn't any more fence. Okay, no problem. Let me see... Seesaw... How did he do the seesaw... Really? There. Good enough. There's nothing out here, anyway. What? I can at least catch some rays out here. You finished already? Yep. All done. That's great. Yeah. Did you need me to do anything else, or... Nah. Take a moment. You deserve it. Hey, I just got a call. Some of the cattle have wandered over to Dawson Ranch. Well, how'd they get out there? I don't know. Must be a gap in the fencing. I did it the way that you showed me, but there was just so much, and I couldn't finish the fence. Wait. You did the fencing? Come on. Let's go get those cattle. Did you need me to come help, or- No. Hey there, Mr. McCleary. Do you need any help with anything? I think I'm doing all right. We're just exercising some horses. Why don't you take a break? Well, I already did that when I should've kept working on the fence. I heard a few cattle went wandering. But don't worry. Travis looked pretty upset. He's just used to things a certain way around here, and change gets him all bent out of shape. I figured after his mom died that staying close to home is what he needed. But all it's done is made him too set in his ways for his own good. So I guess us being here must really be throwing him off. A little. But don't you worry about them cattle or Travis. They'll be fine. Thanks. Well, it looks like you got the cattle all rounded up. And we put a temporary fix in that fence. I shouldn't have left you out there alone. All right, well, I guess I'll see you all at dinner. Guess she didn't want to get her manicure or whatever mucked up doing the fence properly. I mean, this isn't exactly the resort vacation I'm sure she's used to. Yeah, well, you and I don't take vacations. Maybe we should. Olivia, you want a custom-made Justin steak? Sure. Comin' right up, y'all. Hey, I hardly saw you today. I know. I was grinding feed. Prepare yourself, because apparently ranchers have a thing called Manure Monday. Oh. Speaking of which, you know what today is? - Yoga night? - Yep. Hey, we have fun in the city, right? Like movie night and McCool's, of course. Yeah. I mean, it was. What? It seemed depressing. And when I met Dylan, I feel like I just... I fell in love with him because he was someone new, someone who just lives outside of all of that, and it seemed... kind of exciting. Olivia, Amber, your J-steaks are ready. Coming. Thing is, Liv... we can't just talk about all the things we hate forever. Not without trying to change it. - Hey. - Hey. Look, I just wanted to say how sorry I am for not doing the job properly. I understand y'all didn't grow up on a ranch. Plus, this is supposed to be kind of a vacation for you, so... I'll ease up. I think maybe I needed to change things up a little. Then here, why don't you heat that up? Okay. Yeah, there you go. And I'll try and make this trip as enjoyable for you as I can. I promise to be a model temporary rancher. - Deal? - Deal. Okay, well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning. See you in the morning. Hey, Dazzle-Doozy. - She's so worried. - I know. Morning. Where's Olivia? Still sleeping? Oh, heck no. She was up before any of us. Something about finishing a job. Hey... Hey. You know, if you miss breakfast, there won't likely be any left. I'll just eat later, once the job's done. You really don't have to do this. A true rancher wouldn't leave a job half-done. Am I right? Mm-hmm. Well, here. It's no fun working on an empty stomach. Thanks. Well then, we'd better hustle if we want to have some time to go tubing. Tubing? Like down a silo, or... You'll see. Okay. Did you pack the sunscreen? Because this skin is not conditioned for high noon. Where exactly are we tubing? I don't know, but hopefully not down a silo. Hey, gang. Ready to go cool off? Ready as ever. Oh, you may want to put on a closed toe. You've got a better chance of handling a rattler in a pair of boots. Sorry, what? Meet y'all at the truck. Did he mean rattler as in snake? I guess they come with the territory. Here we are. The river that runs through our land. So I suppose the water must be pretty warm on a day like today, huh? Actually, no. It's glacial runoff, so... Oh, how refreshing. This is bear territory, so if we're lucky, we'll spot a bear today. Or two. These bears you speak of, are they nocturnal? Well, if you're talking about black bears, they're a little bit of both. Meaning they like the mornings and late evenings. I'm happy it's high noon now. Now, grizzlies, they're pretty much active all hours of the day and night. Foraging, fishing. Don't worry. I doubt we'll come across any. Now... let the river do the work. All you've got to do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the scenery. Oh, it sounds just like the lazy river at Club Med. Oh! What is it? Is it a bear? It's a leech. It's a leech. I can't, I can't deal. Please don't tell me you have to, like, burn it off or something. You could later. As kindling for the fire. Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to freak out. It's an honest mistake. So does that mean that there are leeches here? It's not like a pool, so... Yeah, you know what? I don't think I'm overheating, so maybe I'll just go back to see if there's more feed to grind. Uh, I'm out, too. Are you sure? Because once you get deep enough... We'll see you back at the ranch! Where the water's moving... I guess it's just us then. It is so cold. So how do you and your friends know one another? Well, Justin met Amber and I at McCool's during their open mic night. What's that? Oh, it's so much fun. Anyone can go up and, like, sing or do a comedy number. So the three of us ended up onstage together, and we just improv'd this, like, silly rap. And now it's kind of become our theme song. Theme song? Yeah. Like our own personal anthem, or "yee-haw" kind of thing. Okay. I think I get it. And what about you and Amber? It all started when our moms met when we were in grade school. It's like we became sisters. So it must be hard on you, then. Her getting engaged and moving on. I mean, Amber's a city girl. We both are. We don't do all this. Would you ever leave the ranch to go live in the city? Heck no. I wouldn't set foot in one if I didn't have to. That's because I've got everything I want right here. Maybe Amber doesn't have that in the city. I mean, do you? Well, no, but I'm not going to just drop everything and come live out here. I get that. For what it's worth, you wear a pair of boots real well. I guess we should head back, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. You good to paddle upstream? Seriously? Just kidding. Come on. The ranch is just over the hill. That water today was so refreshing. I feel so good. Oh, look. They're so pretty. They're everywhere. Yep. This has always been the best spot to find wildflowers. You know, if you get those in some water, they'll likely last the rest of your trip. I guess I should go do that. If you can't find anything to put them in, in the guest house, I'm sure we've got something in the main house. Okay. Maybe I'll do that. - All right, then. - Thanks again. Right. How was the river ride? It was only Olivia and I. The others got scared off. Well, we sure can't afford a bad review. I know, Dad. I am trying. I know you are. And don't worry. We'll get those back taxes paid, and then we'll be able to go back to the way things were around here. - Hey. - Hey. There's tea there, if you want some. Oh, thanks. So where's Amber? Giving Dylan a Zoom tour of the ranch. Mm. You know, you actually missed a lot of fun today. Really? Well, it sounds like maybe it was better that we weren't there. Well, maybe we did prejudge him a little. Especially since the only reason they're doing all this is because they have to. To pay the bills. Well, maybe he'll get something else out of it, too, hmm? No. No way. I am not pulling an Amber. Besides, we are complete opposites. Are you? I'm just saying. Maybe not that different. Hello? - Hey. - Oh. Don't you have a shower in the big house? Yeah, we do. But I prefer to shower outdoors. It's the best way to start the day, if you ask me. Yeah. I was just going to get some coffee because we ran out, so... Oh, sure. Yeah, I'll bring some over in a moment. Okay. All right. Seeing as the cattle drive's a few days away, I think it's important y'all learn some basics. First, it's important to note that everything we do with our cows comes down to driving. Now, a lot of ranchers, they aren't too concerned about how to approach a cow. But I was always taught that the first point of contact's critical. Like a first impression. Exactly. I mean, how would you feel if someone came at you with their arms waving? I'd feel like a cab driver. So what you want to do is approach the cow at an angle, as if you're just going to go on by, so the cow remains calm. Then, we'll put ourselves in their pressure zone to move them along. So let's give it a try. Okay. All right, Amber. You're up. All right. Come on, girl. Whoo! Whoa! Guys! Check this out! All right, that's it. Yep. Push 'em from the hip. Whoa. Whoa. Sorry. I got it! It's your turn, Justin. Get out there. Okay. Okay, come on, Daisy. Here we go! Yeah! Whoo! So like with Amber, you've got to push 'em from the shoulder. Yeah. Okay. Turn 'em with the head. Okay, we want to get him in through that corral. Yeah. This is hard. Come on! I got it! Okay, Olivia. Pull back on the reins. Okay. That's it. Hey, come back here. Where are you guys going? Am I doing it? Nice. Look at that. I did it. No stress here, baby. I think that's enough for one day. Don't want you dancing bowlegged all night. Did you say dancing? Yep. Saturday nights, we all get together at the Black Hoof and kick up our boots. What do you know? Almost like home. But first, we need some fish for tomorrow night's fish fry. So who's up for a little fishing? I'm in. Actually, I think Amber and I will just stick around and work on our driving just a little bit more. But you two go. I mean, Olivia is like a pro at this, so... Um, okay, but I haven't really done any fishing, so... Ah, don't worry about it. It'll be the easiest thing you do all week. So what kind of things do you like to paint? Whatever inspires me, I guess. But to be honest, I haven't been inspired to touch a paintbrush in forever. Does that mean you're just going to keep doing this job you hate? Except now you won't have your best friend to commiserate with. Hey, you could stand to try something new yourself. I mean, at least I'm here, completely out of my comfort zone. Because you want to convince your friend of her mistake. So? At least I'm giving it my all. I mean, look at you. You said you never even set foot in New York. You got that right. It's a good thing. Because you wouldn't have a clue what to do when you got there. Yeah, I don't know about that. Okay, so you're saying you'd know how to get a cab during rush hour without getting it poached? Or how to not get crushed by the subway doors? Or how about which food vendors to eat at and which to avoid? Well, no, but how hard could it be? Uh-uh. Don't even. Because trust me, it is as hard as me trying to lasso a bull. Or get this dang thing untangled. Just give it a gentle tug. I got it, I got it, I got it. Oh! So how's the event plan? All right. That Olivia's a bit of a handful. Oh, here's the crew now. Uh, guys, I think we might be a tad overdressed. There's no such thing. This place could totally pass for McCool's. Guys, they even have a mic for karaoke. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yee-haw. What are they doing? My name's Olivia, it's Liv for short, and I'm an artist at heart. I'm hanging with my girl, she's Amber, my best friend, who gets me and makes it all better, yeah. That's right, I'm Amber, that's what we do, raise a glass and talk about things so true. 'Cause we fit like a glove. Justin here, and I love these two, so I'm going to get in on it and tell it all to you. And okay, that's cool, the cow goes moo, but I miss Manhattan and the taxis, too. City life is the best and there's nothing better than us three getting a latte together. Ooh! Hey, y'all, my name's Travis. And I'm a rancher. I lead my cattle out to the pasture. Been ranchin' my whole life. It just feels right. And if you know me, you know that's no... Bull. Yeah. Give it up for the city folks. Well, thank you for not leaving us out to dry up there. Yeah, we look out for one another around here. I kind of like that little two-step you taught us. You know, we... take it a bit easier on Sundays, so if you want, I can give you another tour, seeing as my first one may have been lacking. You mean the point-and-look tour? "Oh, and over there behind the barn is the hen coop. House is over there. Land is over there." Okay, I get it. So what do you say? Redo? I mean, I wouldn't want you giving a bad review. I would love a redo. Thank you. Hey. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. We were just decompressing, you know, from driving cattle and fishing today. Wow. Too bad you're only here for a week. That's right. Blowing in and out of here like a tumbleweed. - Well, see you tomorrow. - Sure will. Ugh! Shh! Morning. Hey. How's the crew doing? I think a bit too much giddy-up last night. How about you? Slept like a log. Actually, I've slept like a log every night since I've been here. It's the country air. It's like medicine. So are you ready for a little adventure? You bet. Then hop in. Okay. Wow. This is the most stunning view I have ever seen. If you look to that point way over there and follow it all the way across to that ridge? What you're looking at is all our land. This really does make the city seem pretty small. I got you something. It's not professional quality, but it's all I had. This is really so thoughtful. I just... I haven't painted anything in so long. Well, you said you'd paint what inspired you, and I don't know, but to me, it doesn't get more inspiring than this. I mean, my dad, he goes to church every Sunday. But here, this is where I've been coming ever since my mom passed. Somehow, the sun, breeze... it all just makes me feel closer to her. I think you're right. Maybe it is time I had another go. But no peeking. Don't worry. I've got some chapters to catch up on. I promise to keep myself busy. All right. You ready? I'm sure it looks amateur. No. No, it's incredible. You're not just saying that, are you? There are some things This... is definitely one of them. Now come on. You want to try your hand at a little off-roading? For real? Well, the only thing you've got to be on the lookout for around here are animal crossings. Huh. Piece of cake. Yee-haw! This is so much fun. Oh, no! Is it a flat? I just... I didn't want to hit that turtle. I think I hit a big rock. Yeah, looks like a busted drive shaft. Meaning? Meaning we're walking back. Sorry about your truck. Don't worry about it. I'll get it towed back to the ranch. If it's the wildlife you're worried about, don't be. I mean, for the most part, they don't want anything to do with us. And the other part? Here's what you need to know about the animals around here. For starters, this is their territory, so we need to respect that. Like the rooster. Exactly. Nothing's going to come pecking at you if it doesn't feel threatened. And what about that? The wolves? We normally don't have to worry about them. Well... well, when would you worry? Well, when you're talking about a lone wolf. They can be more aggressive because they don't have the support of the pack. Like that day we went on a trail ride. Normally, I would've left those cows out to pasture, but we both saw something. Figured it'd be best to drive 'em back. I had no idea. And here I was trying to prove my point. You're right. I am bothered by how Amber seems to be catching on and not freaking out like I thought she would. Because then she'd stay. Hmm. I get it's hard not having that person you confide your thoughts to. I mean, for me, it was my mom. We'd sit by the fire and talk about all the adventures we'd go on together. It sounds like you were really close. We were. She was so full of life. I mean, she would have loved this whole dude ranch thing. After she was gone, I just threw myself into work. Didn't think about any of those adventures anymore. Just stayed the course. Day in, day out. Amber and I, we always talk about all the things we're going to do. Now she is doing something. And me... well, I'm not. You can think about that painting you did today. Who knows? Maybe that'll inspire more good thoughts. Maybe those memories of your mom will get you thinking about those adventures again. Maybe. Well, thank you. For everything today. Well, don't go writing about it in your review. Or else everybody will think they'll get the same special treatment. Morning. Coffee? Maybe a double espresso would be good. I'm beginning to think this coffee tastes a little better than my lattes. It really gives you that giddy-up and go. I could use it. Are you having a 48-hour recovery? No. I spent my entire Sunday practicing my cattle driving, and it was a lot of hours on horseback. Well, you'd better get used to it. All right. I am off to do my morning chores. Oh- Morning, rooster. Don't mind me. I'm just going to help out the ladies here. Throw that on bread with a little ham, got the perfect western. Who's next? All right. There you are. Enjoy. Step right up, sir. Hey. Do you want to take a ride? I'm headed into town. Nah. I think I'll stay here and keep an eye on the guests. Well, I can't say I blame you. I never would've believed it, but... they're doing all right. Especially Olivia. She's really throwing herself into it. Well, I'm sure it's going to make a great story for her Instagram when she gets back to New York. I mean, we both know she's still a city girl. - Right? - Of course. - Hey. - Hey. I finished all my chores, so I was thinking I'd like to take some of those paints and head out on my own into the pasture. Hopefully get some more inspiration. Sounds like a great idea. But hey, don't wander off too far, now. I won't. Toro? What is it? Okay. It's okay, Olivia. Don't freak out. You are not a threat. It just stood there, staring at me. And then it started to come closer. You sure it was alone? As far as I could tell. Do you think it was that lone wolf? Could have been. Either way, I think it's best if we round up as many cattle as we can and bring 'em back to the corral. All right. I'll go saddle up. Olivia, wait. What? I'll meet you by the barn. Whoa. Right over there. That's where I saw it. Yeah, I think he should've gone back to his pack by now. What? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were a country girl. Whoa. Olivia. You all right? Yeah. All good. Here. Back 'em up. Back off. Back off nice and slow. Y'all all right? Yeah. Yeah, I think you scared it off. Good. Let's hope it goes back to its pack where it belongs. Well, I'd say that's enough excitement for one day. How about we get that cattle corralled? Okay, like this? That was pretty good. Not bad, not bad. - Hey. - Hey. I heard we missed an exciting day. Yeah, but Annie-Got-Her-Gun over there came to the rescue. I get that we're from the city, but she doesn't have to make it so obvious that she thinks I don't belong. I mean, I can do a lot of stuff around here. Of course you can. You know what? You are going to show her what's up. - I am? - Yes. Yes, you are. Come on. Hey, all. Who's up for a best set of three? I'm in. Okay, great. Well, you and Olivia are up. Go show her what's up, okay? Here we go. Okay. Not bad. Yes! Hey. - Here we go. - That's beginner's luck. We'll see. Whoo, Kat. Okay. All right. Here we go, here we go. Yes! Tiebreaker. Oh! Good try. That was great. Bound to happen eventually, Kat. You've got to miss sometime. Eye on the prize. Olivia! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Amber, that was amazing. I mean, she can't say that we don't belong now, right? We can so do this. Yeah. I mean, you definitely can. Me, I am not so sure. Hey. Come on. Sure you can. I don't know. Maybe I am making a big mistake by marrying a rancher. What are you talking about? Come on, you're crushing it here. No, I'm not. I mean, it only looks that way because I was trying to show you that I'm not making a big mistake. I don't know what I'm doing. I mean, I don't know how to manage a ranch or drive cattle. I do know you. Because you're like a sister to me. Which is why I don't want you to leave, but... it's time we made a change. So what you're doing... is not a mistake. And you and I and Justin are going to crush this cattle drive. The city slickers All right. We are going to show them how it's done. We're doing it. Oh, we are doing it. You really think they're ready for this? Ready as they'll ever be. Well, I'm here if you need me. Appreciate that. Well, here they come. I hear there's some cattle that need driving out to pasture. You got that right. Y'all ready? Oh, we're more than ready. Let's giddy-up and do this. Well, gang, you did it. Yes! Oh, um, do you think you could take some more photos for us? Oh, why not. So this is where the cattle will graze for the rest of the season? That's right. Then before the weather turns, we'll round 'em back up and bring 'em back into the winter pasture. Hmm. Who's "we"? You mean Kat? Most likely. You know, I get why you came out here. The whole bachelorette getaway, showing Amber her mistake. But whatever your reasons were, you showed a real go-get-'em spirit. Thanks. But I'm glad you took a chance on us. Well... changing things up around here may not have turned out to be such a bad thing. No. It's not. And I think it might be time that I made a few changes. So these changes... Any idea what they look like? I won't know until I set my brush to the canvas. We'd better head back before we miss lunch. Yeah. Where's Justin? He is saying goodbye to Daisy. I swear, he's going to miss that horse something fierce. What about you? Oh, yeah. Toro was a great horse. He never steered me wrong. Yeah, I'm talking about Travis. - That's crazy. - Is it? Because I see how you two get all moon-eyed when you look at each other. He gets like that? Uh-huh. And so do you. So, what are you going to do about it? What do you mean? There's nothing to do. We leave tomorrow, right? So? You could tell him to come visit you. No. There is no way that man is setting foot in the city. Just promise me that you will tell him how you feel before we leave? Oh, no, no. I can't do that. Yeah, um... of course you can. Because if you don't, it's just going to become one of those things you complain about. But this time, I won't be there to commiserate with you. So... go on. Now? Yeah. Now. Okay. Okay. What? You don't think I have the guts? Fine. I'll show you. See? I can do it. So the day was a success. Yeah, sure was. You know, I've really got to admit it was super-weird having other people here. You know, outsiders, they really don't get all this. I was worried, too, but I would say it worked out even better than I could have hoped. Well, I'm a little bit worried. About us. You know, it's always been just me and you out here, and after this week, I realized that it might not always be that way, so... Look, I just want to tell you that I care about you. A lot. And I've pictured a future with you and I together, and I know we have what it takes to make it work. I mean, we're not out here for a week playing ranchers. We are ranchers. Sorry. I was just saying goodbye to Cyclone, so... Yeah. You know, I'm just going to go. Kat, wait. Uh... I don't know what to say, because for the first time in my life... I don't know what my future looks like. I understand. And for what it's worth, no matter what happens, I'll always be your right hand. And my left. That too. All right. Hey. I waited up for you as long as I could. What happened? I know maybe there was a bit of moon-eye going on, but it's not reality. Reality is Travis and Kat. Not me and Travis. And I know that you've found a rancher, and you are going to live happily ever after. I'm just going to go home, and I'm going to focus on making some other changes. Like with my painting. Right? Now, let's get going. So remember, she likes her mane conditioned twice a week, and her hooves will need a polish at least every other day or else she starts feeling a bit self-conscious. We'll make sure to take good care of her. I'm going to miss her. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. One more selfie. Thanks. No problem. So this is it. Yeah, heading back to the Big Apple to lasso a cab home. Well, I'm sure you'll have no problem, seeing as you're a skilled rancher now. Hardly, but thanks. Well, I guess we'd better get going. Yeah, of course. You forgot your book. It's yours. I don't have the gift. Well, you don't know unless you try. Right. Well, time to get back to work now. - Thanks, babe. - Of course. Well, this is it. I'm off to the wild, Wild West. Well, at least you're not a rookie anymore. I'm going to miss you. You know we're going to talk, like, almost every day. You're going to be great. I know. So are you. - Love you. - Love you more. Did you read the review from our first guests? No. What'd they say? A lot of positive things. Especially that Olivia. In fact, she mentions you quite a bit, about how you were the thing that made her stay so special. Really? She said that? Of course she did. I mean, anyone could see how she came into her own out here, with thanks to you. Look, I can see since she left that you've been keeping your head down, doing what you do. And I could let you be. But I don't think that'll help you. So I'm kicking you off the ranch. What? What do you mean? I mean that you seem to think you've got everything you need right here, but you don't. Because what you need is to go on one of those adventures you and your mom talked about. And head on out to New York. You really think so? Well, she ain't from Denver, is she? No. No, she most definitely is not. Thanks, Dad. Don't mention it. Now go on. Git. And yeah, I was thinking instead of Thai tonight that I would try this new Indian place. Oh, dang. I miss takeout food so much. Ooh, can you take a photo of your food and send it to me? Please? Yes, of course. "Dang"? Are you all country now? Oh, and be careful with those. They're originals. Dang. I've got to call you back. Liv? Liv? See, you've got to get his attention. Like this. I guess you were right. I do not have a clue what I'm doing now that I'm here. What are you doing here? Well, thing is... all those acres of land, they always felt... full... you know, of life. But then after you left... it just felt... empty. And I didn't know what to do about it, so my dad told me to get my butt out here. So... here I am. Here... here you are. Yeah, I get it. This feels totally off, me being here, so, clearly, I don't know what I'm doing, so... No. Travis, wait. The only thing off is how I've been feeling since I got back. Because all this... it feels empty, too. - Really? - Yeah. So what do we do- Wish I could do this all day, but we've got guests coming tomorrow. I'm sure you've got it all under control. Are you kidding? I still have to sweep out my gallery. Then I have to finish that painting of Daisy I promised Justin. Then we have to clean out the chicken coop. Oh, and don't forget, Amber and Dylan are coming in a week. All right. I'll let you go. I'll just drive those cattle out to pasture myself. Huh. Maybe all that can wait?
