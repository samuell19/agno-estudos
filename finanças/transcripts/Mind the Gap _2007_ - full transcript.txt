MIND THE GAP Mind the crap... I wonder if he knows what he just said? Turkey welcomes you! Yasmin, Dilek... Take care. Have a nice day. - And good luck. Thank you. But we're in a hurry, and so are you. - Mind the crap. - Is it so hard to say "gap"? "Mind the gap"! It's not exactly a flattering picture. No, but Sweden is known for its spinelessness. Is this an unfortunate tendency? - Then it's a bloody unfortunate one. - Is that your dad? As a professor of Criminology, do you see a pattern? My study proves how we abandon our responsibilities... I thought so. A society that discourages its citizens from taking a stand... ...is rotten. It's a society digging its own grave. The man's a joke! - Hello, "Car Wreck". - You'd better mind yourself! If you bother my sister, I'll have you! What are you, a cop? Fool... Knowledge is Power Are you mad? The nerve of young people nowadays! Are you all right? Are you dead? Yes, maybe I am... It hurts like hell... What about you? - I'm intact. - Good... Let me give you a hand. Have you applied to the Academy, too? What's your name? - Yasmin. - I'm Elin. Wow, that didn't take you long. My mind went blank. - What does "patriarchal" mean? - "Fatherly". - I can't get away from it, can I? - Elin Enecke? - What's this? - The interview, remember? Hello, Elin. You are Ulf's daughter, right? Right this way. I've actually met you before, when you were a little girl. - What brings you to the Academy? - I was born with police genes. And I'd like to stir up this macho pot. Well then... Why do you want to become a police officer? My mother was mugged last year, and I want to stop violent crime. You help people, and that's... good. - I want to work with people. - I need a job. - My grandad and my dad were cops. - I think I'll be good at it. - My brother's on the force. - I know I'll be good at it. - But I made this decision myself. - What does that emblem stand for? The Chinese Marine Corps. If I make an arrest, I know where the guy's coming from. I know how he grew up, how his mother's mind works. - I know about his life. - I see... I think it's important to know what makes people tick. That's why I'm right for the force. Why did you apply to the Academy? I'd like to change the face of the Swedish police force. - Is that a problem? - No... It's just that you're bleeding. Let's see... Here you are. Thank you. I bumped my head, Iran into this girl... That's life... Thanks. Bloody hell... This won't do. - Let's go. - Where to? To Casualty, my mother works there. - Is your last name Demiruglo? - Demiroglu. Elin! - What happened? - I think I cut myself on my ring. - We ran into each other. - That's right, we ran into each other. - Do you feel sick? - Not at all. It's not as bad as it looks. You won't be needing any stitches. - I'll just clean you up. - Thank you. I haven't done this for ages. Now, where is the saline solution...? - Not bad, for an ENT. - Stop it, Elin. I'm trying to help. - How did the test go? - Fine, fine, fine. Good. Let's see how this goes. It's funny, my dad's a doctor, too. Only he's networking as one now... Well, never mind. This was all my fault, couldn't I treat you to dinner at my place tonight? - What did you do to your head? - I bumped into someone, that's all. - Do they still call you "Car Wreck"? - No, they switched to "Baby Shrek". Just one minute... What happened to your head? Come here. Sit down. This looks like it was done by a butcher. - You need stitches. - They said I didn't need any. Why they do like that... No, not the Turkey bag...! - Want some... "thetic"? - The word is "anaesthetic". - And the answer is no. - As you like. - You always seem to be wet. - Wet and randy. I met this girl at the test, and I asked her over for dinner tonight. - Are you going to play floorball? - Looks like it. I know it's Friday, but the guys want me there. - Only I'll cook first, for you and... - Yasmin. - What have you done? - Nothing. I'm fine. - Hello, Sinan. - Hello. - Is everything packed? - Yes, it's sacked. Good. - How did you hurt your head? - She banged into this girl. And went flying. She thought she was dead, but she wasn't. She was bleeding and she took her to the hospital, and her mum's a doctor. She taped her up, but that made Dad angry. So he sewed her up, without an anaesthetic. - I wasn't angry. - Dad, your temper was awesome. That's fine, sweetheart. I can see it was a headache... Sorry about the pun. I'm glad you're fine now. But we'd better be off. Erik is waiting downstairs in the car. I'd better be off, too. - Put on the bandage. - You must be joking, Dad. - But, Dad... - Do it. Listen to your father. Let's go, sweetheart. Goodbye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Bye, Daddy. I love you. - Bye. Who have we got here? It's the adorable Dilek! - It will keep the germs out. - Check it out... - I love you, my dear. - I love you too, Mum. - Have a nice time. - You, too. Bye! Well hello, Yasmin! Hello, darling. I'll take Dilek's baggity-baggity-bag. - Bye! - Have you hurt yourself, Yasmin? Oh, dear... I thought it was a new fashion. Are you going out? The guys will go wild over that bandage. Yowser, yowser, yowser! Let's see... There we go. She lives right over there. - You'll be coming for supper, right? - I'll bring some> cold beer. - I know her well. - Elin? - Ellen. - Elin... Do you know who else lives there? Henrik Larsson! Hi! Welcome! - Nice... - It's my favourite. So, go on. We came to Sweden 12 years ago. I was only eight, too young to understand. Dad was one of Istanbul's top heart surgeons. One day, the police showed up. He had operated on a dissident. Dad was in trouble even though he was only doing his job. They made life hell for him... us. So we left, and ended up here. My dad figured that Sweden needed thoracic surgeons too. - But now he's a TTT instead. - A TTT? A Turkish Thoracic surgeon Tube driver. Really? To make along story short: He's depressed because he can't work at what he loves and is great at. So he's given up. My mother studies Swedish and works as an Optician. One day this Swedish guy sweeps in looking for some sunglasses and... Right, she fell in love and left my father. To top it off, my sister gets bullied at school. That's my life story. - So that's why you want to be a cop. - I want to make a difference. I want to put my background to good use. I believe in justice. - Does that sound pretentious? - No... I'm so blown away by your dedication. Let's drink to that: to your dedication, and to you. I'm so bloody sick of my family. The "Uniform People". My brother's in the armed forces, too. Like we don't have enough dummies! Do you think I'm not independent enough? - Is that what you think? - I guess you have your reasons... - Like what? - I'm not a shrink. Christ... I'll show them! Good. Go, girl! Cheers! I have a dream. - What's your dream? - It is... It is... ...not to be a doctor, like my dad is always going on about. And inherit Grandad's old doctor's bag. Oh, no! That would be trauma time! I'm going to be the Min... I'm going to be the Minister of Justice. - Now it's your turn. - You'll think I'm ridiculous. - Could you knock off the English? - Sorry... - "Förlåt". - Okay. - I'd like to work with horses. - You do. That's just at the stables, I mean for real, like Barad. - Like who? - Malin Barad. Baryard. - Aren't you with it? - I know who she is. Only I'm not really into snob sports like show-jumping. Forget them, it's the horse I mean. Imagine being one with your horse. The speed, the feeling... Right? It wouldn't be half bad to be a mounted police officer, would it? You know what? They need people like you and me at the Academy. That's a fact. Cheers. - To us! - To us... Hi, I'm Henrik, and I live here. - How are you doing? - Great! Sit down, Panky! - Hi, I'm Henrik. - Yasmin. Henrik Larsson. - What happened to your head? - I had some stitches. It was my fault. I was crouching down and I tripped her up. And we had to go see my mum at the hospital... We marched in there, past all the people waiting, and didn't even pay. Mum hasn't done this sort of thing for years and Yasmin went home... And her dad whipped out his scary bag and this bandage, and made her wear it... This day has been totally mad. I'm going to get into the Academy, you know... Easy-peasy. I bet you could do with a cup of tea. Yes, that would be nice. - Are you still up? - Where have you been? Do you know what time it is? And where's your bandage? - That's enough, Dad. - Have you been drinking? - Yes, I have. - Without a thought for your condition? This is driving me crazy... What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this? You know how important it is, so why don't you speak Swedish? Who cares about me in this country? All I ever have to say in Swedish is: "Mind the crap." Stop it! Just stop it! It's "mind the gap"! Can't you see? The only crap that needs minding is your attitude. And don't give me that bitter: "Poor me, I'm just a tube driver". That's not the issue. The issue is you. And that you're making yourself a bloody victim. That's right. You are a cardiac surgeon, through and through. I know that you're capable of doing anything. But you're so full of pride! Full of stubborn pride! Your bloody pride drove Mum away. And your bloody pride will drive me away, too! How can you talk to your own father like that? Please, Dad, I'm not stupid, you know. When no one's watching you go through motions and mumble medical terms... But I see you. I see everything. And I'm tired of it. I love you, for God's sake. But you've got to pull yourself together. Good night. "Good night". "Good night". Mind the crap... Mind the gap. Mind the gap. - Elin, are you on your way? - Yes. Clean up here, and do a good job. Petra, rinse her off, cool her down, and put on the green blanket. - How did the course go? - It went straight to hell. - Christ... - So this is where you work? It's nice. - I had a great time last night. - You forget this. - Are you still drunk? I thought it was a sling-shot. I couldn't help myself... I want to apologize for nodding off. - Was Henrik nice to you? - You have the sweetest boyfriend. He put me in a taxi and even lent me cab fare. "There are scumbags out there. I know, because I'm a security guard." Right... He seems to think he's Clark Kent, or something. But I don't want to have a superhero boyfriend. Everything's so goody-goody. I'm so bloody sick of niceness. "Turkish delight", well isn't that perfect. All right if I help myself? - Do you like it? - Kind of... Maybe we're just going through a phase. Either that, or I'm hung over. Anyway, we have to lay off the booze and get fit. We've got important things to do. A little birdie told me... ...that we, naturally, made it through to the next stage! So it's on to the physical trials, baby! Don't peak too fast, girlie. Welcome, everyone. My name is Stefan Ljungsäter, and I'm standing in for Roland Hultberg. Ordinarily, I manage the SWAT team, but today I'll be supervising your physical tests. He's gorgeous. The impossible, is that what we will be facing here today? My answer: No. If you are in good shape, you'll be fine. But if you've done a poor job of getting ready... Then you're toast. Good. Any questions? The requirements for women are not the same as for men, right? That's correct. I'll be getting back to that. Any more questions? - The dummy we're supposed to lift... - Speak up! The dummy we're supposed to lift, how much does it weigh? The dummy you will be lifting weighs 77 kg. - The same weight applies for all. - Will that be a problem? Are you psyched? Are you? I said, are you psyched?! Go, Yasmin! - Go for it! - Good, new release the dummy. Wow, you were amazing. Well done! Number 129 is not feeling well. Get her off the track. - Now move it! What's up? Anyone else up for... ...my mouth-to-mouth technique? - Why are we here? - Don't start... - I don't want to do this... - Hi, kids. - Hello, baby sister. Have you missed me? - Hi there, Henrik. How are you? - How'd the game go? - We won. I bought a new floorball club. So, next Sunday... It's my special day, so I get to decide everything. You keep score, Yasmin. I go first, then you, and then Daddy. - Then the initials spell "DYD". - What? - Yeah, like "did". - Funny! - Are you going to talk or play? - Both, 'cause it's my birthday! We don't want Mum messing about with wine, do we? Here you are, darling. And here he is... Sinan, the Sultan of Swing. - Don't brag about yourself. - Hush, Daddy needs to concentrate. A holy in one! - It's "hole in one", Dad. - That's what I said. - I give up! - Don't, I made a holy in one. - How about some scotch, Dad? - Sure. Here you are, Uffe. The name is Ulf. - How's your study going? - What can I say... No one can dispute it. You don't get much resistance in this country. I miss being challenged. You know, "been there, done that"... "Bought the T-shirt." I've never heard that before. - What about you, little lieutenant? - It's "captain". - But I'm going for "general". - Why not? Get them in line, the Defence Staff is a joke. How would you go about solving the structural problems? I was the number two female in the physical trials. - Number two? - Who was better? - Does it matter? - Yasmin, and she was bloody good. Oh, the Turk? Demigoogloo... Demiroglu. And yes, her parents are from Turkey. How do you know about her? We ran a check, now that our little girl's going out in the big bad world. Check out the competition and put in a good word for the product: you. - The name Enecke doesn't hurt. - I don't want your help. In all probability, you're going to need it. Why are you so nasty? I care about you, baby. You're applying for a high-stress job that requires tolerance and honesty. And... do those qualities describe you? Ulf! If she's going to join the force, she'll have to be able to take it. It's hard to be on the beat. She'd like to belong to the mounted police. She'd like to belong to the mounted police. Oh, sweetie-pie... That's a good one. The best of both worlds, that's adorable. I think it's a wise choice. You have the experience, so it's completely realistic. What gives you the right to cut me down? Having been to the university? Laugh as much as you like, but I know what I'm good at. I'm not a cynic, like you. And I'm so glad of that. Elin! Were you just going to leave me there? I'm sick of you dumping on me! If you leave now, it's over! Elin? Let's rock! It worked... I can breathe again. Let's see if the other thing works... You've reached Elin. Leave a message at the tone. Bye! You could at least call and tell me where the hell you are. This is such a sexy line... You're really something, Miss Enecke... Intense. You're not so bad, yourself. - All right if I close my eyes a bit? - You do that. I can't sleep. I miss Mum, can I sleep in your bed? - Of course, but your room is cozier. - Yes, it is. Leave a message after the tone. Hi. I meant what I said. It was rotten of you to leave me stranded like that and all... But I don't want you to be unhappy. And I'm worried about you, too. For God's sake, come home! Do you think Mummy will ever come back? I don't know, but I do know everything will be fine. Try to get some sleep. Yasmin... Wake up, your mobile's ringing. Yasmin! Hurry up, your phone's ringing. You'd better get it. Hi, it's Henrik. I know it's late, but I didn't know who to call. - Is something wrong? - I don't know where Elin is. - I though she might be with you. - No... What's wrong, Henrik? I hope you can go back to sleep. Good night, Yasmin. - Who was it? - A friend. - Who's Henrik? - A friend. - Is he your boyfriend? - No, he's Elin's boyfriend. - Why did he call you? - He just did. - Why did he call so late at night? - Go to sleep! - I bet he's in love with you. - Give it a rest! - He is. - You're stupid. So are you. - Ravi! - Hi, Dilek. - Hello, Mr Doctor-man. Always so serious. Someone has to drive this train. Is it me? Is it you? No, it's you! Come on. - You don't say "mind the"... - Gap? No, only at rush hour. All right, let's go. What a wonderful morning! It's a wonderful morning today... It really is her! - Mum! Sweetheart! - I'm so glad to see you. - Why are you here? I happened to be nearby, so... I'm pretty busy... I'd better run. Of course. But we'll be seeing you at the recital, won't we? Nothing could keep me away from Dilek's magical violin. - I've got to go in now. Bye, Mummy. - Bye, my dearest one. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye. - How are you doing, Sinan? - I'm doing fine. - I feel a bit alone, perhaps. - We are all alone. You've changed. I have to go. Elin, where have you been? What's going on? - I'm nothing. - Damn it, Elin. I can't hear you. - I slept with him. - With who? - Stefan. - Stefan who? - Stefan Ljungsäter. - Oh, no... I wish it wasn't so. It's a nightmare, what should I do? - Are you in love with him? - No, he's too slimy. I can't keep up here. - What were you thinking? - I wasn't exactly thinking... I'm sorry, I have a customer. I'll call you as soon as I can. Okay, but... - Are you closed? - No... I was just going to open. It's always open for you... Thanks. What brings you here? - She didn't come home last night. - Oh... That's strange... I bet her phone batteries were out. And she's stubborn and upset. - Know what I think she did? - No, tell me. I think she's with the horses, she feels safe there. - You think so? - Yes. You are so clever! And I'm so stupid, because it never occurred to me... - That sure took a while. - He was here. Henrik! - Well, what did you say? - That you might be at the stables. I hate lying! This won't do, Elin! You've got to tell him. Where the hell have you been?! - Aren't you at work? - Don't worry, I'll be leaving soon. - Where have you been? - I needed to spend some time alone. I slept over at the stables, and today I've been working. - I know that you slept at the stables. - So why did you ask? That's none of your business! You could have called. Do you know how worried I've been? - Did you listen to your messages? - The batteries are down. It's bloody sunny indoors today, isn't it? - I'm sorry. - Who the hell are you, really? I don't know if I know you. What do you want? Do you have a will of your own? Look at Yasmin, she has ideals, while you... Welcome. I'm Roland Hultberg, and I was supposed to supervise your physical tests, but I was struck down by the flu and Stefan Ljungsäter helped us out. I heard he did a good job. Well then... Last time, there were 3,500 of you. But now that number has been whittled down to 780. The Academy can accommodate 528 students. So keep up the good work. You will be taking an aptitude test, followed by a profile with a psychologist. You will write an essay. You will be interviewed by two seasoned police officers. Any questions? Okay... Let's get moving. Good luck. Are you feeling jumpy? - About meeting that idiot, yes. - He might not even remember you. You've probably been deleted from his mental mailbox. - What about your impulsiveness? - I can control it. Today, I took charge of my life. How would you define yourself? As a woman or an immigrant? As a human being. Well, Elin... You aren't exactly unfamiliar with what being a police officer involves. What would you say your own personal motives are? Your personal reasons. Since I'm a woman, I may have a different perspective to offer. My presence might help calm down certain situations. I could be seen as less threatening compared to my male counterparts. Even though you were not born here, your command of Swedish is excellent. - Has it been a high priority? - Yes. - How do you view your background? - I'm proud of my heritage. - Do you feel you fit in? - Yes, I do. Absolutely. We can't be teaching Muslims how to handle weapons. Speak of the devil... They're serving pork today. Isn't it uncomfortable to know you're here on a quota? I can't let it get to me. - There's something wrong with him. - Right, he needs a brain transplant! - I think he's a criminal. - What? Being stupid isn't a crime. I'll make sure he doesn't get admitted. I can find out if he has a record. - Because your name is Enecke? - That's right. - Check Conny Svensson for me. - So now Daddy's useful, is he? - Why should I? - Because he's a bloody racist. And he's applying to the Academy. Oh, has he been bad to your Turkish friend? Do you ever listen to yourself? The guy harasses her when no one's looking. - Wogs are a bit too sensitive. - What's wrong with you? Baby, I was teasing you. It's so easy to wind you up. Life isn't just easy, it's a bed of roses, too. CRIMINAL RECORDS Insert clearance card. - Thank you, Singoalla. - It's Yasmin. Now I remember. But you look like a Singoalla. I know the people who live there. - Ellen. - Elin... Guess who also lives there. Henrik Larsson! Hi. Well if it isn't Henrik Larsson. Elin called to say she's late, and that you should make yourself at home. - That's not a problem for you, is it? - Do I hang around too much? - I'm so embarrassed. - Fool... We love to have company, you know that. It's nice having you over. And I can beat you at Trivial Pursuit. In your dreams, Henrik! No way. - Yes... Christ, I'm dying for a shower. - Could you make some tea? - Sure... Could you bring me a towel? They're in the big closet. Here I come... Sorry. Give it to me, I'm cold. "Ulla has a puppy, Kalle has a cat." "Nisse is sitting quietly on an old chair." "Anna dances in her swirly shirt." - It's "skirt", not "shirt". - "Skirt". "Eva is out with little brother. The sun is shining." - "Eva is wearing a new shirt." - "...a new skirt". I'm home! Hi, why are you sitting out here? - Isn't Yasmin here? - No... What's the matter? Did somebody die? I have something to tell you. I... kissed someone. I'm glad you told me, we should be honest with each other. And I've kissed somebody, too. - You've kissed somebody, too. - Yes. - Right now? - No... It's not a big deal. We've been going through a rough patch, and suddenly there's a situation... A kiss - come on! It was just a kiss, after all. - It wasn't more than that, was it? - No, no... - So, what about you? - No... - Do you want to know who it was? - Absolutely not. I think we should forget all about this. - It was Yasmin. - What? - I kissed Yasmin. Here. Just now. - What the hell...?! - Sorry. - Sorry? What the hell...? Henrik, things are so over between us. It's been over for so long. You can go to hell! Cheers! To us! Turkey's new Foreign Minister, Mehmet Ipekci came to Stockholm... - What was that? - "Fat Mehmet". I don't believe it, "Fat Mehmet"! I thought we were friends! - How are you? - I'm fine. - Daddy, Elin's here. - How nice to see you. Come on in and sit. Sit... Sit, sit, sit... Excuse me, I am excited. That's Turkey's new Foreign Minister, and we went to school in Galatasaray together. We called him "Fat Mehmet". - Isn't Galatasaray a soccer team? - It's a part of Istanbul. We went to boarding school there. - I've told you that, haven't I? - About a zillion times. - Was he the one who wet his bed? - No... He was fat, and he smuggled in lots of sweets. - And now he's the Foreign Minister. - That's nice. I've got to run, I only came to drop something off. Do you have to go? Well, take care. Bye. You'll walk me to the door, won't you? Get this into your head: I never want to see you again! Joel Bergkvist? Gustav Danell? Yasmin Demiroglu? - Isn't Yasmin Demiroglu here? - She's busy grooming her camels. She hasn't called in "I, either. Anyone know where she might be? Yes, I think I do. She's been subjected to racist slurs during these trials. And that's why she's not here. Give me an hour, and she'll be here. One hour, that's all I ask. I'll take that as a yes. I know you're there! Open the door, for God's sake! I knew it! You are not backing out now! All because I was a jackass! You ran the course in 8.30. - 8.48. - Whatever, that's not the point! No one is better than you. No one would make a better police officer. I was going to break up with Henrik anyways, so kiss him as much as you like. Now get moving! We've got a racist to catch, too. Don't just stand there, come on! - Hello. So, you're back on board. - Absolutely. You have one hell of a good friend there. - You do know that, don't you? - I certainly do. - This is going well. - I don't know what they want. You're the department's wet dream: A talented young woman with a foreign background. - I was joking. But it wasn't funny. - Oops. Time for lunch. Now's our chance, I'm going to check out that Conny bastard. - Be careful, Elin! - You stay here and stand guard. - Well, hello... There you are. - Yes, I'm catching my breath. - Is this so strenuous? - No, it's stimulating. You practically get over-stimulated. I bet... Give it your best shot, you can go far. - Thank you... - Are you all right? I know this great move, inspired by the Heimlich manoeuvre... - If you're interested? - Thanks, but I'm fine. Good luck! - What was that all about? - Mr Hot Stuff was here. - Oh, no... Where is he now'? - He went in there. I struck gold. - Does Conny have a record? - Is the Pope Catholic? Take a look: "Criminal damage, aggravated assault and extortion". He was in prison from November 2002 to June 2003. We've got him! How did you get this information? - Does it matter? - Yes, it matters a lot. We aren't allowed to check police records without permission. And that definitely goes for you, too. There could be serious consequences. - We couldn't just let it go... - Is there anything we can do? You've done too much already. We can't condone it. This must be discussed with the admissions board. Condone what? You can do as you please with the information. We were being responsible. I'm sorry to tell you this, but this might keep you out of the Academy. I'm so glad you could make it! - Where's Erik? - He won't be coming. I'm off. I'll stay at Nisse's place tonight. - It's the best option for both of us. - Absolutely. Call me, if you need me. I wanted you to know. It was going too far. Yes, indeed... Thank you, I appreciate your loyalty. - I'm glad to be of service. - We'll keep in touch. Bye. Oh, sweetheart... What have you gone and done this time? Have you made a habit of not answering? You dragged my name in the mud. You can forget about the Academy! - What's with all the bags? - I need a place to stay tonight. You're coming with us. After we moved to Sweden, his outlook became so bleak. He shut me out. I couldn't reach him. I couldn't stand it. I need joy in my life, Yasmin. But Daddy's happy now. Can't you tell, Mummy? - Is it going to work out? - I don't know. I really want it to workout. - I love your father. - But you chose Erik. It's easy to know what's right in hindsight. Don't worry about Erik. He likes to joke about everything. He's a different kind of person, I don't think they hurt as bad. Sweetheart... - So, how are things with you? - Terrible. We blew it. - What do you mean? I wish I was 11, and you could make it all better. Come to me, and be 11 again. Come here. Remember, you are fantastic. You are capable of anything. I admire you so much. There are things I can't do... Hey, is this the same girl who was going to be the Minister of Just... The Minister of Justice. - The Minister of Justice. - That's right, the Minister of Just... This blasted language! Don't forget your little baby. Keep it, it looks great there ever by the TV. - That's about it... - Does Nisse have a big place? It's a big flat, his sister lives there, too. Hello, I just wanted to introduce myself. - This is Sara. - Nisse's sister. - Nice to meet you. I'm Elin. - I know. I just wanted to say thank you. - Thank me? - For letting him go. They don't make them like Henrik anymore, I almost have to pinch myself. The world is full of bastards. But I'm sure you're going to find a great guy. With that wonderful temperament of yours... Henrik has told me about you. - Sara's into horses, too. - Like you. She competes, too. She's great. The next "Bayrad"... It's Baryard. I'm a reserve for Team Sweden. I'm just happy to be a part of it all. It was nice to meet you, Elin. Bye. Super! Well... I'll pick up the rest later. Nisse will have to give me a hand with the sofa. The keys. Oh, Mum, I'm so sick of myself... I'm like a tornado, I make a mess and a lot of noise. - It's not very attractive. - Don't say that. Don't say that! You're the only one in our family with true courage, civil courage! I admire you for that. I wish I was a little girl and you could make it all better. - Well, you aren't. - I know. - Are you going to be a police officer? - I blew my chance. - Do you want to be one? - Yes, I do! - What exactly are we doing? - Trust my instincts. Your instincts are what worry me... - I give up, he's boring... - Come on. Mr Minister, it's time for lunch. It's a Swedish smörgårsbord. Mr Minister? Mr Minister... - An ambulance! Call an ambulance! - The Turkish minister has collapsed. - Let's go home, Elin. - No. Come on! - He's asking for Sinan Demiroglu... - What's that? A Turkish doctor, living in Sweden. He won't budge on that point. - Respect the wishes of the patient. - We need info on a Sinan... Do you know how that's spelled? - Demiloro, or something like that. Male, around 50. Collapsed outdoors. - He's a doctor, not a tube driver. - Listen, I think I can help you. Pulse: 140. SP: 100160. Saturation: 95. His family has a history of heart disease. The government requires your assistance as a surgeon. - I don't understand. - The patient wants you. - Who is this patient? - The Foreign Minister of Turkey. Fat Mehmet! Agility, what's that? "Dressage" for dogs. Watch out! Make way... - It's strange that he's gone. - Give it a rest. - You broke up with him. - I still need to talk... Tell it to the horses, their ears won't get blisters. - Well, what else is new? - We suck. We're useless... Now that Henrik's gone, would you like to move in? I've always wanted to live with a comedian. - How about an ice cream? - Sure. I'll go and get us some, and you can guard our criminal. Mr Doctor-man! Mr Doctor-man! - I'll take over here. - I understand this is urgent. Always so serious. Great. Hurry up. Mind the gap. Good luck! You don't want a waistline like mine. Here you are. - I think you're beautiful. - Not many do... Fat old Yugoslavians aren't that hot. - I need the facts on the case. - Absolutely, I'll call the hospital. I guess we'll have to shovel manure for Malin Baryard. - Now that we blew the Academy. - Police work is in my blood... - How could this have happened? - We're such good people, too... That's right. Morally superior. Minister of Justice... Yeah, right! Mounted police force, goodbye! - Is that a poem? - Sure, by Verner von Heidenstam. I thought it had a familiar ring to it. Hello... Don't worry, I'm here. Everything's going to be fine. - Where did he come from? - He applied for a job here once. You will be performing the surgery, won't you? You're the only one I trust. - What are they up to? - Gun cases... Distract him... Keep him occupied. Well, hello... A friend and a colleague. I think I'm lost. This isn't really my neighbourhood... But then again, I'm a stranger in this country, aren't I? I can't tell one little red cottage with white trimmings from another. Jump... - That's my dog you're holding. - Yes, it is. - It's a very nice dog. - Get me the police. Welcome. I'm Elisabeth Nygård, the attending cardiac surgeon. I deeply respect your professional skills, but we cannot let you operate. I'm so sorry, Dr Demiroglu, but we must adhere to Swedish law. - I understand. - I know who you are. As a student, I saw you operate in Frankfurt. And it was tremendously impressive. I would be honoured if you would assist me during surgery. Saw... Diathermy. Retractor. Start the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. The cardiopulmonary bypass is on. Full flow. Get in, back first. - That goes for you, too. - Can he bring his dog along? - No, I'm allergic to dogs. - Call my mother. - Please let me talk. - Be brief. Her number is 528 37 66, and her name is Ing-Marie. - We'll take care of it. - Thanks. Get into the car. Mind your head. Back in. Legs in... You are a surgeon, through and through! I know that you're capable of doing anything. But you're so full of pride! Your bloody pride drove Mum away. And your bloody pride will drive me away, too! Please, Dad, I'm not stupid, you know. When no one's watching you go through motions and mumble medical terms... But I see everything. There, there, doggy... Don't worry. We're not police officers and we never will be... That's it, we're done. - Disconnect the bypass. - Disconnecting the bypass... We keep our finger in cross. - Congratulations, Dr Nygård. - The credit belongs to you. - Thank you, Dr Demiroglu. - Call me Sinan. - Thank you. You've been fantastic. - Hello, Elin. - What brings you here, Dad? I hope I'm not interrupting anything... I just wanted to tell you personally that Conny Svensson won't be bothering you again. He's in custody. What about me and Yasmin? There will be no repercussions. In spite of your transgression. - Did you pull any strings? - No. Nice horse... It's yours, isn't it? Oh, Dad, I have a small, brown pony. The same one I've always had. Right... What about us? I hope you get accepted. - What are you doing? - Waiting for the mail. There won't be any mail today, they're on strike. - Really? - No, I'm joking. You mustn't forget to laugh at life, too. - Hurry up, Dilek! - I know, we're late already. Sweetheart... Get over here... I wish you luck today, at the hospital. - And I'm happy for you. - I'm happy for us. Good luck to you as well, honey. Bye. I won't be accepted, Daddy. What does it matter? Not at all. The main thing is... that you gave it your best shot. You have done such a great job and... And maybe I've haven't let you know how proud that makes me. You have such strength, my dear. Both in your mind and in your body. What I'm trying to say is... ...that getting this far is a victory. - Isn't that how you say it? - Yes. Have you been studying Swedish? All I've done is read some Henry Mankell books... I think it's time for me to leave home, Daddy. Ts that a bit early, dear? You're just a child... Look at you, you're all grown up. - You're all grown up. - Yes, I am. My little girl. Well, well... Good luck today. And say hi to the Foreign Minister. Good luck, yourself. I really hope you get accepted. That was a close call, my dear fat friend. What have you done to me? And all because I didn't share my sweets with you at school. No, you never did share. Fat and stingy, that's you all over! I'll make it up to you. I'll buy you an entire sweets factory, if that's what you want. Oh, no! I won't let you off that easily. You will be coming back to Turkey with me, won't you? We really need people like you. How could I? My family, my whole life is here now, my friend. Sinan, I am eternally grateful. You saved my life. Shit! - It was in the mail. - Mine, too. Meet you half-way! Dr Demiroglu... We've m-m-met. Georg Lagerkloo. I remember you. You are the head of the department. We are very pleased to have you here. It didn't sound like that ten years ago. Let's... leave the past behind us and look to the future. A more formal meeting will take place at later date, but... You possess skills we are in dire need of. Sol have two questions for you. Number one: Would you consider working here? And my second question is: Is there a language problem? My answer to question number one is... yes. Good... And my answer to question number two is... - A light problem. - That's the eye of the needle, then. You will have to take a crash course in Swedish. With an emphasis on medical terminology... But... it will be tailored to your own circumstances. Private lessons... What do you say? I say... awesome!
