Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I've been doing this for 50 fucking years, like being photographed and doing movies. After a while, I'm tired of it. You think you give something away by talking about it now? No. I don't give anything away. Blue moon You saw me standing alone Without a dream in my heart Without a love of my own Feel so bad I got a worried mind I'm so lonesome all the time Since I left my baby behind On Blue Bayou Saving nickels, saving dimes Working till the sun don't shine Looking forward to happier times On Blue Bayou I'm going back someday Come what may To Blue Bayou Where the folks are fine And the world is mine On Blue Bayou Where those fishing boats With their sails afloat If I could only see That familiar sunrise Through sleepy eyes How happy I'd be Gonna see my baby again Gonna be with some of my friends Maybe I'll feel better again On Blue Bayou I'm going back someday Come what may To Blue Bayou Where you sleep all day And the catfish play On Blue Bayou… Well, I gotta get in character and have a smoke. Now, do I have any… do I have any lines? I don't want any lines. How about doing nothing? How about silence? Somethin' must have cut your tongue out. Either that or… you got somethin'… to hide. Well, I'm gonna call up this number and see if they can tell me who you are. Operator, we need a line out, please. Los Angeles, California… I don't think Harry's a man of big words. And I respect that actors can't necessarily really open up that much when they're just on their own as themselves. If you use your life and you use pain in your life and you use mistakes in your life, it's hard if you use that for a part to then come out with it in a conversation. But it's something sacred in the actor's heart that allows him to do that and pull from it and… I think the actor needs to protect that inside himself. Mm. It means, "How far away I am from the land where I was born." "Intense nostalgia invades my mind." You couldn't sing that in English. "Here I am alone and sad like a leaf on the wind." "I wanna cry, I wanna die." "I feel so much for my home." "Oh, land of the sun, I'm sighing to see you." "Now I'm far away, I live without light, without love." "Here I am alone and sad like a leaf on the wind." It's the theme song in Paris, Texas. It's a blues song. Homesick. I see it as when you're truly at home, there's no more suffering and no more leaf on the wind, no more crying… crying to get back to where you come from. And do you know where you come from? No, there's no answer to that. But do you have memories from your childhood? Uh… Well, there's a lot of personal things I don't want to talk about, you know, like… things with my… my mother. But, uh, some things I don't wanna… get into. You mean talking about your mother or father? Both. Your mother would sing to you. Yeah, she did. She taught me Irish songs. Ultimately there's no answer to any of it. It all just happened, it's what is. We think we're in charge of our lives, we're not. "Be still…" - "…and know." - And not know. Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Enough of that kitty crap. Jones? Jonesy? Good Jonesy. Meow! Meow. Here, kitty, kitty. Here, Jonesy. Jonesy. God, do you believe we're going around the sun at 17,000 miles an hour, is that what it is? - Huh? - Yeah. I think so. Is that what you've heard? Yeah. I think it's 17,000… That's… It makes me nervous, man. 17,000 miles an hour? And there is nothing I can do about it, man. Damn, look at that. - It's a big bowl. - That is a cup of coffee. - Damn, Harry, it's like a swimming pool. - Is that enough for a minute? Yeah, this is great. Yuban. It's a nice flavor. - So, how did you meet? - Harry and I? I got a list of all the films. Yeah? We've done… How many did we do? Two or three? Harry, I'm gonna tell ya. I loved, uh… Straight… Straight Story. Harry Dean was in The Cowboy and the Frenchman, Wild at Heart, Hotel Room, Straight Story, Inland Empire, and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Ah, we've done five. One, two, three, four, five, six things together. Wow. We're a team. Yeah. This is your first line. For what, this speech? Uh, no, coming in. When you come in, he says, uh, "Freddie and I just had a tea at the commissary." And then you… then you say this. - The "dreadful"? - Yeah. Just… Oh, yeah, that's already in the script. But it's just, "Dreadful." Um, actually you could do the big gesture if you want. - Yeah. - You can, you can, you… And which is… Dreadful! Dreadful. - You know, bring the British sense. - Dreadful! Yeah. And it just stops you. Dreadful! There… There you go! If you look at all the characters he's played, just these, I mean, he's been in, how many, 170 films or something? Uh, over 200. Over 200. So, um… - 250, maybe. - Yeah. Sure, sure, sure. I've lost count a long time ago. But, uh… uh… you see many different, you know, characters. He's got this quality, um… It's funny talking about him over here, but, um, he's got this innocence and naturalness that's really rare. And… he, uh, says a line and you… It's not… It's just, it's just real. It's so phenomenal. And what he does in between the lines is incredible. A lot of people, you can sort of see them, they're not really listening, they're not within the thing in between the lines. And you can see them start thinking about their next line. Just a subtle little thing. Not Harry. You watch him in between the lines, he is there. Whatever "there" needs to be, he's there. Sit down, Alvin. Did you ride that thing all the way out here to see me? I did, Lyle. Jack Nicholson called me, he said, "Harry, I've got this part for you." Said, "His name is Blind Dick Riley." "He wears a derby and patch over one eye." He said, "But I don't want you to do anything in the movie." And I was already thinking along those lines anyway. Uh-huh. And, uh, just playing myself, just play Harry Dean Stanton. He said, "Let the wardrobe do the character." Yeah. That… and that had a… that sort of solidified my whole approach from then on. How would you describe yourself? As nothing. There is no self. And how would you like to be remembered? It doesn't matter. What were your dreams as a child? Nightmares. I spent my first 18 years on one of these goddamn things working for my uncle that raised me, and I worked myself cross-eyed too. About the only thing I had for distraction was… was this dog. I had the dog since I was ten years old. And, uh, he… he shot it for sticking its tongue on a pad of butter. So, I stayed one more night. Then I killed his seed bull and I rustled every damn horse he had, including a racer that I sold as a cow pony to an Indian rancher, and I took the whole damn remuda. And I come within a hair's breadth of sending his sorry hide to kingdom come. I mean, I was that close to shooting that son of a bitch in the brain pan. - Where did you grow up, Harry? - Kentucky. I was born in a little town called West Irvine, Kentucky. And, uh, West Irvine, not Irvine. - Irvine was bigger. - Another place. It had 40 people in it. And in the Depression, we moved to North Carolina. He had a 300-acre farm, tobacco farm. Near where? In Durham, around Durham? There's a little place called White Rock. It's now no more. It was only a huge general store with a post office in it. - That was the town. - Got you. It's not there anymore. - And did you go to the war? - Yeah. How was… Which service were you in? In the Navy. - What kind of ship were you on? - LST, landing ship tanks. But we carried troops and we ended up as an ammunition ship. And where was your… You're in the Pacific, but whereabouts? - Battle of Okinawa. - Wow. So what are the other questions there? - Have you ever been married? - No. The next question was, "How did you meet your wife?" Did you ever wanna get married? I love the line "I was married two weeks once." We tried everything, it didn't work. - Did what? - Did you ever wanna get married? Yeah, I wanted… I… I think I proposed two or three times. - Uh… Two that I can recall. - Uh-huh. Thank God they said no, because I was doing it because I thought you're supposed to get married. - Uh-huh. Yeah. - Not because I wanted to. Uh-huh. I just never felt psychologically wired or capable of dealing with being in an institution of any kind. Yeah. I can see that, Harry. Two or three times girls said they were pregnant, just out of brief affairs. Sad, sad story. Did you ever check on it to see if you…? - I never had a DNA test, no. - But did you ever wonder about it? Yeah, I've got one kid I'm pretty sure is mine. But I've been in touch with all of them off and on, but I never really bonded with their mother or them either. - I've just been a loner all my life. - Uh-huh. It's the way it happened, I… I learned this from Harry. Ancient pond, frog jumps in… - Old pond. - …splash. - Old pond. - Ancient pond. - No, old pond. - You said ancient. You've had it wrong all these years? I swear I learned it from you. You told me "ancient." No, it's: "Old pond, frog jumps in…" - Splash. - "…splash." Jesus Christ. Never broke into a car, never hot-wired a car, kid. Never broke into a trunk. "I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof, nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm." It's what I call the Repo Code, kid. Don't forget it. Etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore. Hey. Look at that. Look at those assholes over there. Ordinary fucking people, I hate 'em. - Me too. - What do you know, kid? See, an ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations. Repo man spends his life getting into tense situations. Assholes. Let's go get a drink. Okay. Harry Dean is so old, I love him. I love old people, I hate young people. Spremne. Tally-ho. So who are you, now? Ron. Don't call me Don. A lot of people… It pisses me off. What do you do? I'm actually into a space program now. - Are you an astronaut? - A special division of a space program. Michael, give me a vodka and cranberry juice. - I mean a tequila and cranberry juice. - Yes, sir. Please. Moline. Harry Dean! - Harry Dean, I'm talking to you. - Yes, go on. - Why don't you get married and stay home? - Get what? - Get married and stay home. - Can't I just stay home? I'm dying. Michael, I'll have a cigarette with you. Santa Monica Boulevard. We are friends for 42 years. - Forty-two years. - Yes, sir. I know you 42 years. - What year did you start here? - '68. - '68, and it opened in '64, right? - Yes, sir. - '64… - And you've been coming since '64. You are one of the first customers in this place. And you are great people, we love you. You know that. I know. You know, I'm jealous. You got more girls than I did, those days. I don't know why. Well, I've settled down since then. Okay. You don't talk too much. When you say something, you say lots. You are simple and easy. You don't talk too much. - I don't, huh? - No. But when you say something, it means something. It does. That's good to know. Who is that? Get her in the movie. Hey! Hey! She's gone. The Odd Couple. Very good. - Oh, another night in paradise. - You guys got some history in this joint. Closer walk with Thee Grant it, Jesus, is my plea Daily walking Close to Thee Let it be, dear Lord Let it be Let it be, dear Lord Let it be Through the days Of toil that's near If I fall, dear Lord Who cares? Who but Thee My burden shares? None but Thee Dear Lord None but Thee Straight ahead. Everybody talking at me This is a heroin song, by the way. Written by Fred Neil. It was inspired by Luke Askew, an actor. Everybody talking at me Can't hear a word they're saying Only the echoes of my mind People stop and staring I can't see their faces Only the shadows of their eyes I'm going where the sun Keeps shining Through the pouring rain Going where the climate Suits my clothes Banking off the northeast wind Sailing on a summer breeze Skipping over the ocean Like a stone Everybody talking at me Can't hear a word they're saying Only the echoes of my mind And I won't let you leave My love behind And I won't let you leave My love behind And I won't let you Leave My love Behind Pretty song, huh? Straight ahead. That's what my old man used to say when I was a kid. "Go straight ahead till you hit something." This life is a black hole. I was 14 in my aunt's house. I got terrified out of nowhere. I was alone. I started thinking there's nothing out there. It's a void. Terrified. I had to call somebody to see if I was still connected. Our family wasn't close. My mother and father. It was hard because they didn't get along. Finally they got a divorce when I was in high school. But we got close before she passed away. I sent her a little ceramic heart when she was in the hospital. And the nurse at the hospital broke it. They sent it back and I glued it back together. Mended the heart and sent it back to her. That was our last memories. That was nice. Oh, the nights are so still Not a baby will cry Not a chill wind will blow Disturbing the sky But there's no peace in me I'm burning for you And I'm walking the floor In the devil's shoes * When I get my rewards I will bring them to you I will ask for your love And swear mine is true Will you cast me aside And see me no more Or will I win your heart When I get my rewards? They say that your hand Can never touch mine That a poor boy can't hope For a woman so fine But I'll work till I fall Determined to win Driven by need To see you again Once you got famous, was your mother pleased with that? Oh, yeah, they were all impressed, yeah. I had this idea of a man, uh, completely estranged from the culture and coming back in from the desert, from Mexico. Couldn't speak, no identity. Uh… A complete unknown. And he just appears out of nowhere. We don't know anything about him. And then he begins to, uh, piece together some mysterious past, you know. And slowly, hopefully, over the course of things, it makes some kind of sense, having to do with his brother and his family, and things that happened to him in the past. And Wim wanted me to play the character, and I said I didn't really want to. I thought it was enough to write the damn thing. We wrote it for over four years or something, and sometimes had the money, sometimes didn't. But it was like four or five years. It was a long process. And finally I said, "Well, what about Harry Dean?" 'Cause he'd been known basically up to that time as a character actor. Which he is, a wonderful character actor. And everybody said, "Well, can he play a lead?" And I said, "Why not, if he's a character actor?" I mean, what's the difference? He just plays the lead. I had an actor, I had a lead actor, who had been in movies for 30 years and had never played a lead. And Harry's big concern every now and then was that he wasn't good enough. And of course everybody confirmed that we loved him, that he was fantastic and that nothing was wrong, but Harry had… Sometimes 30 years of playing supporting parts sort of got to him and he had doubts that he was good enough as a leading man. Every now and then that hit him and we had to drive it back into his head that he was perfect. Harry's allowed himself to be very vulnerable in that part and let us look into his soul. And Harry is fragile. Harry is vulnerable. People were not used to their leading men to open up so much. So I think Harry really touched a lot of people's hearts, because he dared to be fragile. Harry is an actor's actor. Every actor who ever sees him admires him for his craftsmanship and what he does and who he is. So you don't have to be a lead to be well thought of. In fact, I think it's probably better not to be. You know, he's also one of those actors who knows that his face is a story. And he doesn't have to… He just has to be in that thing and his face is the story. You know what I mean? You read all kinds of things into it. Harry told me a little bit about his life and I realized we had found an actor who'd really be fully behind the character and who'd really also understood a lot about a man who had… left behind his family and his little boy. And Harry really in a big way, with his whole persona, with his whole biography, with everything he had, put himself behind the part. And Harry, in an almost scary way, got into character. Do you remember your little boy? Well, he's with us. He's been living with Anne and me ever since you disappeared. We didn't know what else to do, so we just kept him. One day he was just standing at the door. All he could tell us was that someone brought him there in a car. He didn't know what had happened to you, or Jane. So we tried everything we could think of to find you or Jane. Tried to locate her. She'd vanished too. We didn't know what else to do. Harry did so many parts in this city and in the movie industry where he didn't have to show who he was. I mean, I remember Harry in impossible parts. I remember him in Young Doctors in Love. Stuff like that, and Harry… and where acting was just a front and had nothing to do with him. When you prepared to play Travis, what did you do? Well, he didn't talk for about a half an hour in the movie. So I did nothing. I didn't prepare, I just didn't talk. A student from UCLA, working for nothing on the movie, just to learn… We were talking once and I asked her… I said, "I wonder why he doesn't talk." And she said, "I did that when I was a teenager." You mind telling me where you're headed, Trav? What's out there? There's nothing out there. I said, "Well, could you hear other people talking?" "Oh yeah. My mother would say, 'I know she can talk, but she wouldn't talk to anybody.'" So finally I asked her, I said, "So why didn't you talk?" And she said, "I was afraid if I said anything, I would lose it." "Freak out." And, uh… I could have used that more… in the movie, but I didn't, I had already done it. But just not saying anything is already a powerful statement. Not talking. Being silent. Silence is very powerful. But when you talked, it was great. You know, that monologue. Yeah. That was Sam Shepard's writing. Brilliant writing. Suffering. There's this girl and he was jealous. I knew these people. What people? These two people. They were in love with each other. The girl was very young. About 17 or 18, I guess. And the guy was quite a bit older. And he was kind of raggedy and wild. And she was very beautiful. You know? Yeah. And together, they turned everything into a kind of an adventure. And she liked that. Just an ordinary trip down to the grocery store was full of adventure. And they were always laughing at stupid things. He liked to make her laugh. And they didn't much care for anything else, uh, 'cause all they wanted to do was be with each other. They were always together. Sounds like they were very happy. Yes, they were. They were real happy. And he… he loved her more than… he ever felt possible. He's searching for freedom like everybody, I think. Searching for liberation. To be free of everything. And I think everybody is, that's what everybody wants. Freedom from the fear of death. Freedom from facing the void without being afraid. I think everybody is afraid. Most people. This fear you're gonna lose something, it's attachment. Everybody is attached. But you're trying not to be attached. Yeah, that's love, when you're not attached. That's real love. In the twilight glow I see her Blue eyes crying in the rain When we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again Love is like a dying ember Only memories remain And through the ages I'll remember Blue eyes crying in the rain And when we meet again up yonder We'll stroll hand in hand again In a land that knows no parting Blue eyes crying in the rain Blue eyes crying In the rain That's Rebecca's favorite song. I left her crying in the rain once. - What did you do? - Huh? What did you do? I don't know, a lot of things. I can't… Many things. How long were you together? About a year and a half. - And did you live together? - Yeah, she lived up here. - And then what happened? - She left with Tom Cruise. I got her in a movie with Tom Cruise and she ended up with Tom for two years. Risky Business. An apt title. How did you feel about that? - Huh? - How did you feel about that? I didn't realize how attached I was to her. I was heartbroken. Everybody evolves in their own way. There's no answer to it. I didn't commit. Go out and drank and looked for women. That was my lifestyle. Womanizer. It's all a movie. Including this conversation. Nobody knows the ending. It was hard for Harry to come to terms with the fact that Sam and I, in the end, were both adamant that the best ending was, and the most heroic effort was for him to leave and let his son and his wife be together. And that was almost a condition for them to be able to be together, that he stepped away. And I always thought of it as a beautiful act of love on his behalf. And of course Harry knew what I meant, but somehow in his heart he really wanted us to find a twist, to give a little glimpse of hope that there was a family afterwards. I looked for love In all the same old places Found the bottom of the bottle Always dry But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it 'Cause there's nothing like your love To get me high And you're as smooth As Tennessee whiskey You're as sweet As strawberry wine You're as warm As a glass of brandy And I stay stoned on your love All the time And I stay stoned on your love All the time Hey, Harry Dean, it's Debbie Harry. - Hey, beautiful. - Hi. Hey, good-looking. Oh, thank you. I was gonna leave you a message and say, "Don't worry, I haven't mentioned that night at my manager's house." Deborah Harry, I didn't realize, she wrote a song about me. Uh, what is it? "I Want That Man," or… I wanna dance with Harry Dean Drive through Texas In a black limousine Uh… I don't know the rest. I can't remember. Uh… I want a piece of heaven Before I die I think that's the next line. It was about me in Paris, Texas, and I didn't realize at the time what a great accolade she was giving me. He found out about the song or somebody told him about it. And then so we had, of course, then to meet. Well, she called me after the song had been out for years. And we got together and, uh… bonded. He seems to me, um… properly involved with, you know, the world of Hollywood. You know what I mean? He is always going to be an actor. I mean, that… He's… You know, he has this good sense of proportion about his values, I think. You know? He has managed to have long-term relationships, which is very often not the case out there because it's such a competitive, you know, focused environment. You know, people run through each other's lives very quickly. And he has maintained relationships for many, many years with a lot of people. And I think that really speaks well for him. You lived with Jack Nicholson? Yeah, about 2½ years, up in Laurel Canyon. That was a trip. That was right before… That's when he did Easy Rider. That's got him started. It was never boring. We had arguments occasionally. - But you're still close, right? - Yeah, we've been close forever. He's a loyal friend. Yeah, we did two or three films together. Missouri Breaks, that was with Marlon Brando and Jack. Is that how you met Marlon Brando? I might have met him briefly before, but he lived next to Jack. But that's when we first really met. We didn't see each other for years. Until the last three years of his life. We bonded. We talked all the time for hours. On the phone. He was great, I love Marlon. Miss him. Everything. He was into everything. Eastern religions, poetry… And he had a dark side. He was the macrocosm of man, of a human being. He had everything. He was the greatest, of all of them. Him and Montgomery Clift. Montgomery Clift influenced Marlon. He said he was a big influence on him. Montgomery Clift. He was one of the most truthful actors of all. What advice would you give to a young actor? Play yourself. You have to work on every part you play. Research. And you try to personalize everything. And that's playing yourself. Sometimes the words… It's an acting term called "the available stimulus." The dialogue itself… If it's good writing, it has an influence on you. What was that David Lynch film that Dennis Hopper did? - Um, Blue Velvet? - Blue Velvet, yeah. He wanted me on that, and I didn't wanna deal with those emotions. So you would have played the Dennis Hopper part? Yeah. I was trained on a stage. I did Shakespeare, I did Greek drama, everything. Uh… But I wanted to be in the movies. I didn't care about stage, I still don't. It's too much work. It takes too long and they don't pay enough. I remember figuring that one out early on. And you got a bigger audience if you're in a movie. And you get more money and you can travel. And did it help to meet women? Of course. That's one reason I did it, I think. Like every male. Every man wants to get laid. That's all you think about. I kind of do everything for him. Everything from making coffee, buy his groceries, to… I learn his lines. I learn the lines of all the people in the scene with him so that we can run lines together and we can learn the scene. It's kind of like a master class a lot of the time. And then when I travel with him, I coordinate his travel and I run his security. He gets a script and he works it 24 hours a day. It's in his lap, he's talking about it. He'll call me and do the lines. It's just in there. He will get on set, he'll do other people's lines. I'm talking to the famous Harry Dean Stanton? And what would you like to say to him? What I would like to say is that I think that you are phenomenal, that you are a legend, you're a hell of an actor, and I think that you are a philosopher of life. Yeah? I put it like this: - Friendship is essential to the soul. - What? Friendship is essential to the soul. Friendship is a what? Friendship is essential to the soul. - Friendship. - Is the what to the…? - Is essential to the soul. - Essential. - To the soul. - To the soul. So guess what? You've always been a friend of mine. He says, "Do nothing," all the time, right? "Do nothing." Which is bullshit, because if he did nothing, he'd still be on a fucking rocking chair in Kentucky. You know? That's what doing nothing gets you, is exactly that. Nothing. He wanted to get out. You know? He never saw himself staying there. Not ever. And he had two brothers that stayed and, you know, who lived by the bible and had families and kids and the whole thing, have grandkids. That was never his gig. Not ever did he imagine himself that way. I was just a good old boy when you were born, right? In Kentucky. You weren't even around when I was born. No, but my grandpappy was around, so who were they? What were they? - Yeah, what were they? - People. - Okay. Alright then. - Yeah. But, actually, I can tell in your heart you didn't really feel that. - You didn't give a damn yourself. - It was puzzling to me, the whole thing. Why are they talking about… What's wrong with Black people? I bet that he would always say, "What the fuck." You know. - Hey. "What's going on?" - Yeah. 'Cause Harry is gonna ask questions. He asks questions, motherfucker. Goddamn, man. I love you. I love you too, partner. You're my man. You're cool. When you're an older person who's wildly successful, it's very easy to look back and go, "I didn't try." The truth is he tried his whole life. He's still trying. He's kind of the Forrest Gump of Hollywood. Um, not by any means the lack of intelligence, but in the way he just stumbles through extraordinary circumstances. - We gotta get a group together, buddy. - Yeah. Who are you thinking about? - Billy? Donny? - Yeah, you and me. Maybe Swan and Fritz. This time we save our money, man. We take our time, get it tight, and then slip it in there as slick as shit, man. Sweet Jesus, look at that little ass, man. God, it's beautiful. You missed it, man. God, they're all over the place, man. We gotta get us some ladies tonight. You know any? Yeah. That goddamn Virginia, man. A man's gotta have his outside women's too, you know that? Yeah. Lord, would you look at you Now that you're here Ain't you proud of your peers And the long way you've come? Harry Dean got me in my first movie that I did. We were down at the Troubadour and he brought me a script and did a screen test with me, helped me through it. And then he was in the film with me. It was called Cisco Pike. God, he was so much a part of my life, that we… When I was still working at the Troubadour, he would get up and sing with me every now and then. Usually he loved to sing Mexican songs, and… As far as… Well, speak of the devil. - Oh, here he is. - The big star has arrived. I'm barely mobile. - It's a reunion of Cisco Pike. - Cisco Pike, yeah, yeah. That's the first one we did, right? That was the one you got me into and you did the screen test with me. Oh, yeah, and broke the bottle. Remember that? Yes. I never did anything like that in my life. The director sticks his head out and says, uh, "When you come in, I want you to scare Kris." He's a helicopter pilot, a boxer, all-American hero, and I'm gonna scare him. I was desperate and I saw a beer bottle sitting in the corner. Empty beer bottle. I knocked on the door, and it started to open, and I broke the bottle on the doorknob and grabbed him by the shirt and stuck it under his chin. And it worked. We're both still working. Come to Mexico, Billy. People know you're here. I say this as a friend. Hell no, Max, he ain't gonna be nothing but another drunken gringo shitting out chili peppers and waiting for nothing. It's got a good edge. Gracias, amigo. Remember when me and Dylan ran through his shot? I had forgotten about that, that was perfect. We're shooting a scene at sunset. It was supposed to be sunset for sunrise. Maybe you can have two takes, but probably you only have one take, when the sun is just perfect. And we're just halfway through the scene when into the background comes Harry Dean and Bob Dylan, jogging. And they were… It was incredible because it ruined the shot. - We came back… - And you came back in and I remember… Peckinpah: "What the fuck were you doing?" He said, "You know you just ruined the shot for the whole day, that we have to do it tomorrow?" And he says, "Sam, I was running after him, trying to tell him…" - To get out of there. - To get out of there. - Which was a total lie. - It was a total lie and everybody knew it. Did you party a lot together? - Probably. - Probably. Probably. We hung out with the same people. I know you were up at Jack Nicholson's every time I was up there. - Yeah. - I thought you lived there. - Are you doing any films right now? - I'm doing a film with Sean Penn. I'm playing a guy that invented the wheels for luggage. Robert Plath. - Invented the wheels for luggage? - He's still alive. Yeah, I talked to him on the phone. I remember you were so mad at the director in Cisco Pike. We had our big scene in the car that you got drunk. I'd have to keep slapping you in between takes to wake you up. I don't know if you remember that. You were supposed to be wasted in the scene anyway. - That's why I got drunk, I think. - I think it was. - And stoned too, probably. - Probably. Probably. "And a problem when he's stoned." - Yeah. You wanna do that one? - Okay. See him wasted on the sidewalk In his jacket and his jeans Wearing yesterday's misfortunes Like a smile Once he had a future Full of money, love, and dreams Which he spent Like they was going out of style And he keeps right on a-changin' For the better or the worse Searching for a shrine He's never found Never knowing if believing Is a blessing or a curse Or if the going up Was worth the coming down He's a poet, he's a picker He's a prophet, he's a pusher He's a pilgrim and a preacher And a problem when he's stoned He's a walking contradiction Partly truth and partly fiction Taking every wrong direction On his lonely way back home And there's a lot of wrong directions On that lonesome way back home That wasn't just about Harry Dean. - It was about Dennis Hopper. - That was about me and Dennis, and… Johnny Cash thought I wrote it about him. - He could have been in it. - I get it, he was part of it. - And Waylon. - And Waylon. When I think about you, I think your heart is really into music more than anything else. Yeah, I still love it and it's… frustrating because I never pursued it. I've avoided success artfully. And that's a… That's a conflict. But it's what is. Something's been worrying me, I just gotta get it off my mind. It's, uh… It's my age, man. I mean, it shows. Man, if you're still worried about that business in the car, forget it. No, man, that's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about when we get up on that stage again, under those lights, man. You know, the wrinkles, it maybe don't look too good. Oh jeez, man. What? Hey, man, it's true, isn't it? Fuck me. It ain't your goddamn body they're after, man, it's your soul. It's all gonna go away. You're gonna go, I'm gonna… Everybody's gonna go. The sun's burning out. The earth's gonna go. It's all transient. Everything is transient. So it's ultimately not important. It's all fleeting, passing. And that's not a negative concept. It's just what is. It's liberating. Just everything happens. It's all one connected whole that's happening. No answer to it. That's Buddhistic, but I am not a Buddhist. - What are you? - Nothing. It's a relief. Isn't that a relief? When you're nothing, there's no problems. At a time when the world Seems to be spinning Hopelessly out of control There's believers and deceivers And old in-betweeners That seem to have no place to go It's the same old song It's right and it's wrong And living is just something That I do And with no place to hide I looked in your eyes And I found myself in you I looked to the stars And tried all of the bars And I've nearly gone up in smoke But now my hand's on the wheel There's something that's real And I feel like I'm going home It's the same damn tune It's the man in the moon It's the way that I feel about you And with no place to hide I looked in your eyes And I found myself in you I looked to the stars Tried all of the bars And I've nearly gone up in smoke But now my hand's on the wheel I have something that's real And I feel Like I'm going home - It's good, huh? - Very good. Good words. And there's a couple of mistakes, but leave them in there. Who gives a fuck? It doesn't matter. No. That's one of the first things you said to me. When we started doing gigs together, one of the first things you said to me was, "There are no mistakes." So now what? That's it, I think. Uh… We did "Tennessee Whiskey," didn't we? Yeah. I didn't do an Irish song. I'll do "Danny Boy." What the hell, now I am warmed up. I should preface this song. This was written by a father, singing to his son. He had lost two sons in two other wars. He's singing to his youngest son who's going to war, and, uh… It's his youngest son and it's the Irish national anthem. Give me the chord. Oh Danny boy, the pipes The pipes are calling From glen to glen And down the mountainside The summer's gone And all the leaves are falling It's you, it's you must go And I must bide But come ye back When summer's in the meadow Or when the valley's hushed And white with snow Yes, I'll be here In sunshine or in shadow Oh Danny boy Oh Danny boy I love you so And if you come And all the leaves are dying And I am dead As dead I well may be You'll come and find the place Where I am lying And kneel And say an Ave there for me And I will hear Though soft you tread above me Then all my dreams Will warm and sweeter be If you'll just bend And then tell me that you love me Then I will sleep in peace Until you come To Me That's it.
