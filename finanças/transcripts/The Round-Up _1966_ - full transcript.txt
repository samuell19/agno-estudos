The Round-Up Pest Buda. The 1860's. The industrial revolution, enrichment... The age of Ferenc Deák, Gyula Andrássy, Kálmán Tisza. The spirit of 1848 is no more than a phrase, only the welfare of the bourgeoisie is important. The people have lived the same way for centuries. Indeed, the lean years, following one after another, from the middle of the '60's, have increased their destitution. Criminal cases are multiplying, as are the desperate attempts by those born in poverty to break free. The regime is pitiless. It seeks the outlaws and highwaymen everywhere. They are the last vestige of active resistance. They are criminals in the eyes of officials, they are freedom fighters in folk songs. In 1869 Count Gedeon Raday was appointed Commissar with a specific sphere of authority. His task - to create material security. His main target - the outlaws. He wasn't particular about his methods. - Is it them? - Yes. - Your husband and your son? - Yes. Please come with me. Stop here. - Do you have any relatives? - Yes. - Parents? - Yes. Don't be surprised if they never see you again. - I won't. - Won't you? - No. - Why not? You people don't really like my kind. I speak four languages and I've often been abroad. You smuggled in Kossuth's papers in those days. - I was young. - Yes, you were young. You may go now. Line up! All in order. - Bring them closer. - Come closer! - Any hard cases? - Yes. Which one? - That one. - Any more? And that one with the cape. - The short black cape? - Yes. Let's go. - Are you János Gajdor? - I am. Come over here. Are you a farmer? Yes, I am. I have three farms. Are you a self-seeker? - That's what they say. - A clever man? They say so. Do you know whether in your area there are any renowned herdsmen? There are. - Shepherds? - Those too. Who, for instance? The Kecsege Szûcs family, the Ferde Balogs, Kis Balogs... - Kis Balogs? - Yes. Did you know the Kis Balogs? - I know them. - I didn't ask if you know them. - I asked if you knew them. - I knew them. Well, the Kis Balogs are dead. They were strangled. They were renowned shepherds. Renowned and wealthy, too. - Wealthy. - Did they have quality sheep? Yes. A lot of their sheep vanished. Renowned sheep, quality sheep. Do you know how they were strangled? - No. No, I don't. - With a halter. With this halter. Don't you recognise it? - No. - Take it in your hand. - Are you frightened of it? - No. Seeing you've taken it, put it around your neck. Men were killed with it. You're not frightened of it? - No. - Didn't you kill them? No, no. I don't kill people. I'm self-seeking, but I don't kill people. - You're not frightened, then? - No. Then keep it around your neck and tie a bow. I can do that. - Finished? - Yes. Good. You may go. Take him away. Please, stop. Come here, János Gajdor. Go inside. - I killed them. - Come on. Do you know the penalty for killing them? I do. Ease your conscience, have you killed others apart from them? Yes, I have. But not many. Who and what? Would you tell me? For your conscience and maybe your fate. Well, I've killed... three other people. - Three? - Yes. Gabor Telkes in '61, then two years later, Palkó János Czeder. Then, in '66... No, in '67, Feri Csulak. - This Feri Csulak... - We know who he was. Maybe it doesn't count that I killed him. Maybe. I don't know. So, János Gajdor, there is a solution for you. If, at the earthworks, you find anyone more guilty than you... someone who killed more people... then you'll be pardoned. We won't hang you. So the terms are that you find such a man. - Understand? - Yes. - Will you undertake it? - Well... I must. All right, you may leave. One, two, one, two... Halt! Rope down. Follow me. Let's go. Faster. Come here. Open them again. Good day. Please... That one is such a person. Open up! Out! Stand straight! Leave him. What's your name? You know it. Varjú. Of course. Béla. Béla Varjú. You've had many a beating from me, haven't you? You're going back to the big yard, understand? You may thank this man. - Why? Don't you know him? - I know him. - Well? What did I say? - Thank you. Not like that, with respect. Is that enough? If you want, he'll even kiss your hand. Let's go. You, too. Come here. Take off his shackles. Go back to your friends. Get going! Do you have any friends? No, nor relatives at a time like this. I should have kissed your hand, János. You mean, the bishop's, my son. You can't imagine what it was like in there. You can't endure it. I couldn't have if you hadn't intervened. I have a lot to thank you for. How did you get here? - They caught me. - Why weren't you careful? - They caught you, too. - Did someone squeal? Maybe. Was there any evidence against you? Or any action? Well? You're not here for nothing. What did you do? Listen... they questioned me a lot and I said nothing. Why are you inquiring about this? Do you still remember the old songs, Béla? Leave me alone. Stop! Come back from there. They'll shoot you. Don't you understand? Stand over there. You come with me. You... and you. You... and you. No, you. You come here. You, too. Hurry up! Well, let's go. You're coming with us. Let's go. Come here! Put it down there. That's right, there. And you people, put those down there. And you, too. Over here. You may go. Move back. Go on, go on. Come here. Women, go further back. Even further. Stop. Stop! Shoot in the air. Fire! - Come back. - If he doesn't stop, shoot! Come on, Béla Varjú. Pick two friends to accompany you. Ease your conscience, Béla. Why don't you do it? Confess. Who did you kill? - Six people. - Who? Tell me, who! - Six people. - The names. Say the names. - Köves Kovács, Pista Kis, Kenyér. - And? Józsi Kenyér. More, more! Tell me about the other two. Their names. At least say their names. Józsi Kenyér. Excuse me, officer. Stand aside. Step back. Demote him. Take him away. Come on. Sir, please exonerate me, and save me from the gallows. Because the man you just executed has killed more people. When I went with him to the gallows he admitted to six. Look, János Gajdor... everyone should have the brains to relate the confession of a dead man. It's your life that we're talking about. If you could tell me exactly who he killed, then maybe we could find out. The trouble is he only told me of three. After that his strength gave out. Then he started to get really scared. Well, you see, János Gajdor, that doesn't help you at all. It's as if you heard nothing. Just go back. Go on. Don't upset yourself. You must get used to it. We'll have to be redeemed one day, some way, some other way. Why don't you speak? They're impossible, and yet I'd have given them a farm. They're as hard as nails. Haven't you tried them out? They used to let you go. Three calves and I could go. The next time, another three. Now they're hard. Come on. Let's see our friends. - I'm not going anywhere. - Come on. Let's take a walk. I know you. That's possible. You've escorted me. One escorts many people. - Aren't you from the lower regions? - No. - Are you from Szeged? - No. - They say I'm Veszelka. - Veszelka? Yes, they say I'm him, that I killed an officer and took his place. Before, they said he was dead. Now they say that I'm him. - Can you understand it? - No. If I can't prove I'm not him, they'll hang me. Yet this Veszelka has killed many. - At least seven. - Seven! I'll be absolved. Seven! - This man has killed... - Go to hell! Come here. Let's go. Excuse me... - I know you. - But I don't. Get away from here. - Excuse me... - Come on. Stop. Yes. Wait outside. Sir, this convict wants to say something important. - Go on. - Excuse me... - I was told to find... - Yes, I know. If you'd allow me to go around and look... - Now? - Now. It should be done now, among the solitary ones. Take him. Open the cells. - Show this man out. - Have you found Veszelka? It's not him. Please... Let's go. - Please don't hurt me. - Let's go. Line up. You too. Sir, they're assembled. You stop here. You go ahead. So, he's not here. Let's go back. Stop. - Don't put the lamps out. - Yes, sir. Stand against the wall. Come here. We're going back. Everyone, stand up. In line. Stand up in line again. Hurry up. What are you waiting for? Get back. Hurry up! Let's go. - Excuse me... - Stay there. You are lmre Veszelka. You are intelligent and clever. We're not asking you to find anyone. We're not asking you for any names. Just tell us how many of Sándor's men we've caught. You... Come with me. Halt! Attention! Turn around! Five steps forward! Women stay there. Stop there. Excuse me... You know, Veszelka's killed more people than I have. Therefore I'm absolved. And Veszelka has been found. - Take off his hood. - Right. Go over towards that row. Stop. Come here. Help him. Walk along here. Know anyone here? - No. - Then walk along again. Put that down. Go on. Come here. - Know anyone now? - No. Excuse me! I know someone who belongs to Sándor's gang. Juli! Run! One... two... Come on. Sit down. Hoods off! Come on. - Stop it! - Don't! Restore order. Everyone settle down. Hear me? Form a square. Let's go, let's go. Faster. Move it. Let's go! Bring that man over here. Come here. Which one of them is Sándor? Sir, he's not here. Sándor is not at the earthworks. Had he been here, I'd have reported it long ago. Are you certain of that? It's in my interests. So you're quite certain he's not at the earthworks? He's not. But if you like, I'll find out where he is. The girl has died. You're to find someone who belongs to Sándor's gang. Clear? - Yes, Sir. - You help him. Go to hell! Excuse me... I'm frightened. Please protect me. We'll protect you. Sit down over there. Hand out the provisions. Sir, they usually get it in their cells. Now they'll get it here. Over to the wall. Sit in groups of five. Come on, hurry up... Sit down. One... two... three... five... Come to the front. Three... Hurry up. Go to the front. Let's go. You hurry, too. Sit down. Escort that man up. Put him in that one. In cell number two. Bring him out. - They've strangled him. - That's obvious. Which two cells did we leave open last night? - Apart from Gajdor's? - Of course. This one... and that one. You... - Are you Mihály Lovas Sr? - Mihály Kabai Lovas. - Did you leave your cell today? - No. No? Right. Go over there. - Mihály Kabai Lovas Jr? - Yes. - Did you leave your cell? - No. No. Right. Come inside. We left two cell doors open last night. It was either one or both of you. Who killed him? I asked, who killed him? - Not me. - Not me. Right. Both of you should be hanged. But we'll only hang one. One man for another. Think about who killed János Gajdor. Come back. You, too. Was it you? - No. - No. Right. So you won't admit it. What I said will happen. We'll hang one of you. Choose. Is Sándor here? - No. - Is Sándor here? No. Right. Go inside and think about if he's here or not. Close the door. Father, do you know Sándor? - You know him too. - I don't. You do. You've seen him. You've seen him often. Is he inside here? - No. - Are you certain? - Yes. - Come outside. You stay here. I'd like to say something, please. I'll show you who Sándor is, if you will pardon me. If you pardon both of us. All right. If you show me Sándor, I'll pardon both of you. - Do you want their hoods off? - That's not necessary. Found him? Show me. - So, is it him? - Yes. He was very brave in '48. His gang joined Kossuth's with Sándor as captain. It was reported to him once that two of his gang had attacked a merchant and assaulted his wife. Sándor summoned the two men. He waited for them with his pistol loaded. When the two lads appeared, Sándor shot them. Then he shouted loudly, "That's outlaw's honour!" They never stole while they were Kossuth's soldiers. How do you know Sándor? He came out to the field in '67, he even spoke to me. He visited us last year. I served the wine. I saw him this year, too. That's not Sándor. You know it, too. Sándor is not here. Take him away. Come on. - Go inside. - Excuse me... I strangled that man. Come out. Repeat it. - I killed him. - You're both lying. You're lying. Both of you. Both of you should be hanged. But I stand by what I said. Only one. Choose. - This is the longer one. - Please... Please... I'll tell you who killed him. - So it wasn't you. - No, sir. I just opened the door. I opened it, waited till he did it, then I went back. My son didn't leave his cell all night. All right. Come and show me who it was. It's him. Well? I killed him. How? His son came to my cell during the night. He opened it, took my place, waited until I'd done it, then he locked me in. So it wasn't him? You're all lying. Take them away. Stand there. - The chains. - Men, the chains. Turn your backs. Stand up. Kabai, stand up. Don't you hear? Hear that? It's music. Put it down here. Put it next to it in a row. Put that down, too. Boots, over here. Company, halt. Get undressed. You may rest. Warden, sir... - Well? - I'd like to have a wash. Hear that, Józsi? He wants to wash. What about the rest of you? That's enough, Torma. Maybe you'd care to report. I humbly report... two guards and three prisoners. Why are you people still here? There were no other orders. Everyone must join up. - But they are hard cases. - Even the hard cases. They're part of Sándor's gang. Even so, everyone must. Let's go. Let's go. Wait here. - I humbly report... - Bring them here. - Name? - Mihály Kabai Lovas Jr. - Ever been a soldier? - No. - And you? - I was, sir. In '48. - Where did you serve? - With the rebels. - Were you a rebel? - I was in the cavalry. Sir, I was also a cavalry rebel. That's rare. You still have the skills? It's not possible to forget, sir. I've never witnessed it. Would you show me? - If you have the horses. - We do. - Any choice? - Yes. - Saddlery, too? - Whatever you like. Come on. Help yourselves. This one. I don't need a saddle. Stop! Give that to me. Stop! Stop it. Give it to them. That was beautiful, my friend. You're an expert. Would you form a corps like that? A cavalry troop? Yes, but I don't want him in it. - Are they all from there? - Yes, the earthworks. - Everyone here? - Yes. - Any sick? - No. Go ahead. Let's go. Line up at the back. Come on. Are they all here? There are more. Are they all the former ones? Yes, they are. - Are they all alive? - No. At the time, many died in Damjanich's army. And since then, at the earthworks, too. Imre Veszelka. But those who are alive... are they all here? Yes. Line up according to height. You, too. - So, now they're all here. - Sándor is still missing. - He won't come, anyway. - Of course, he will. - If we asked him, he will. - No need! Sir, I humbly report the troops are assembled. Men... from the Commander-in-Chief... His Majesty Ferenc József I, Emperor of Austria, by the grace of God, Apostolic King of Hungary, pardons Sándor, the leader, in his absence. Lajos Kossuth sent a message That his regiment is spent If he sends that message again We must all go Long live Hungarian liberty! Long live our homeland! The rest of the troop will get their just punishment.
