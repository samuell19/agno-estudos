This guy that Jane's living with, that for all I know is gonna get married to, she doesn't even mention Costello to him. Why were you even talking to the boyfriend in the first place? - I can't talk to people? - Listen, Duff... If I cheated on Marci before we got together, right? And I take her to this racket, you're gonna go up to her and talk to her about it? What is your point? That is a nice hat. Hey, detective! All right, guys... Take her out. Be careful. Good job. She's been strangled. And it doesn't look like she's been dead long either. Excuse me, detective? Found this on top of the trash pile at the bottom of the chute. Maybe it went in before the body did. - Okay, thanks. - All right. Lip gloss, another lip gloss, brush, gum. Oh... Second notice on a utility bill... Gloria Lopez, apartment 4-A. It's not an official I.D., but it's something. I'll go hit 4-A. You talk to the super, get a list of the tenants. All right. Gloria Lopez. Hey, where have you been? If I didn't have caffeine soon, I was gonna kill myself. Jane, you have no idea what I went through - to get these. - What? Yuppies... when they're craving coffee, they're vicious animals. It's like a war zone. It's a coffee joint, not nam. Then there was this guy... Chad... Not only was he holding up the line, but then when he got there, he asked for something, like, with a "doppio." How pretentious is that? I don't even know what it is. I don't know... maybe he wanted to make his coffee stupider. - Exactly. - Stuffy in here. I know, isn't it? You know Reg and Lou... They caught one in a garbage chute in a sixth-floor tenement walk-up, so I bet they're not stuffy. I bet they're freezing their nibblies off. - Poor Lou. - Hello. Looky here. Can someone crack a darn window around here, for the love of God? Okay, who was first on the scene? Victim was D.O.A. When we got here, we found the victim's husband performing CPR. My, uh, partner had to drag him off into the bedroom. Heart attack? That's what we thought. Oh, look at that. And who is with the husband? - He's outside. - Hey. Did you stay with him the whole time? Till uniforms got here and took over. - Uh-huh. And did he say anything - about the gunshot wound? - Nope. Did you say anything to him about it? Didn't think you'd want me to. You thought right. Morning, ma'am. Is this, uh, Gloria Lopez's apartment? - Mm-hmm. I'm her. - Oh, okay. Does, uh... Does your daughter live here with you? My daughter lives in Houston with her boyfriend for, like, eight years now. What do you want to know about? Can I come in, please, ma'am? So, uh... You live here alone, then, do you, Mrs. Lopez? No. My granddaughter lives here too. Is she in trouble? No. Is she home? Yeah, she's sleeping. But, yeah... Well, if I could just talk to her for a second, I can be out of your way. Christina? Christina. Ugh. I told her, she sneaks out one more time, she's gonna be grounded. I'm sleeping in the living room so she doesn't go out the front door. You know what? She takes the fire escape, like it's, you know... like it's not a thing. You got any idea where she might go? Where she always go... The boys upstairs. I keep telling her, stay away. But teenage girls... They don't listen to nothing. Teenage. How old? 15. She's the sweetest girl. And she's so smart, you know? But she always says she's bored. She just wants to have fun all the time. Mrs. Lopez... Is this your granddaughter? Yeah, that's my Christina. Why are you here? Tell me why you're here. - I'm sorry. - No, no... Prime Suspect Season 01 Episode 12 Ain't No Sunshine Original Air Date January 22, 2012 Hey. Hey, you can't come in here, yo. - Move. - No? Well, I wonder what we're doing here, then. - Well, what the hell you want? - What do we want? We want to know what happened to a 15-year-old girl who was found dead in the chute this morning, because she was in this apartment last night. Hey. You bitches got a warrant? Oh, we don't need one to talk. We're just talking. - No, we ain't. - All right, so I'm talking. Is that weed I smell? Huh? Is that weed right here? - You smell weed, Duff? - Yeah, I smell it. We're going to the squad room, right? We're gonna have a little chat? I don't want our youth engaged in illicit drug use. Get up. Hey, yo, relax. Don't tell him to relax. Move, or I'll move you. You, let's go. Come on. Uh, Mr. Coleman? How you doing, sir? I'm Detective Timoney. This is Detective Blando. - Hi. - Hi. Could you tell us about last night, please? Tell you? Uh... I... we went to bed around 11:00. The alarm went off, uh... About 6:30. I got up. I thought she was up already. I went into the bathroom, and, uh... and she was there. She was cold. Uh, you didn't notice her getting out of bed? Do you, uh, have houseguests here, by any chance? What? No. Does anyone else have keys to your place? No. Why? I-I-I'm sorry, um... What kind of detectives are you? We're from homicide, sir. But Meg had a heart attack. Well, that's not exactly true, sir. Mr. Coleman, do you own a gun? Meg was shot? Someone shot Meg? Someone killed her? Yes, sir. Well, who? How can that be? - Victim is a 15-year-old girl... Maybe raped, definitely strangled, then thrown down the garbage chute of her building. Suspects are a couple of gangbangers she used to hang out with in an apartment upstairs, plus the one banger's little brother, who seems to live there too. Ev, will... will you get out of that chair, please, and put the baseball down? Just pretend I'm the lieutenant, but only more handsome. And I won't get up while you're talking to use my private bathroom. You know what? Sweeney's gonna be back from that conference in two days, and then we'll find out when he said, "Ev, you're in charge while I'm gone," if he was joking or not, 'cause I got 50 bucks says he was. Two days is a long time, Timoney. - Meanwhile, what do you got? - I got a victim... Female, 55, works for her family's hedge fund, found in the bathroom. First glance, looks like a heart attack. Then the EMTs find an entry wound under her armpit, bullet in the upper torso... No struggle, no defensive wounds, no forced entry. Husband's a, uh... What would you call it, Augie? A man of leisure. Gigolo. Also claims that they were alone all night, claims that he doesn't own a gun, and on his nightstand, nothing but true-crime books and, uh, research stuff about investigation techniques. He's writing a novel, he says. Yeah, which I cannot wait to read. I-I'm gonna go see Iris at the M.E.'s office, see if I can get anything on the body. Lou and I are gonna divide and conquer, try and get one of these gerbils to rat out against the other. As, uh, far as the little brother, I'm not sure what to do. Well, he can sit in here with me. I'll, uh, keep an eye on him and make some calls and find a legal guardian to release him to. - Hey, Bobby Jones. - Yeah? Can you put in a request to unseal these gangbangers' juvie records? Can I? Yes. Will I? Yes... - Oh! - I'm out! - Do something! - You don't be golfing in here! - Hey! - What'd I tell you? - Oh! - You saw it! I told you. I told y'all, don't be golfing in here. Shut up! Shut up! Let me think! Everybody in the building knew her. Everybody but you? Her grandma says she used to sneak up to your place all the time. Girl couldn't be stopped, she says. All right. Not your business what some girl can and can't do, right? 15 years old... She got "A"s and "B"s at school. But you want what you want, right? And you took it. And you threw her out with the trash... Like she wasn't even a person. Can I get a soda or something? We're gonna lay this all out, all right? Okay, I haven't seen your juvie records yet. I can tell you've done this before. You know how this all goes down. I've been here before too, man. That's why I'm not asking you any questions, okay? See, I'm saving myself for when we get the results of the tests we're running on the girl. In fact, I'm gonna go get myself a cup of tea. I'm gonna get a little lemon. You want anything? Yeah, get me a soda. We're all out. So... No parents. Grandparents? How about a... An aunt or uncle? Huh? I know it's hard. I grew up running with crowds like yours, but that is not the way it has to go, young man. You put in the work, you can do whatever. Shut up. Or I'll tell everybody you grabbed my joint. - Am I interrupting something? - Nope. What you got? Okay, well... I'm thinking our best bet is an online auction. So there's this kid here in long island... He's got a gumball machine that's exactly like sweeney's. Monitoring the situation... I'm feeling really good about it. I meant about the juvie report on this one's brother and the other guy, fool. Listen, I already put in a call to the supreme court to unseal the records. Should get an answer back this afternoon. Can't be soon enough for me. The bullet entered from a steep downward angle into the right hemothorax... Mm. Rupturing the ventricular wall and settling in the aorta. And there was no blood on the scene 'cause why? Oh, there was lots of bleeding, but it was all internal. She didn't know what hit her. One minute, she's futzing around. The next, she was gone... Not a bad way to go. Yeah, but how did it miss her arm? Maybe she was reaching for something or yoga... doing a sun salutation. - Or raising the roof. - Or raising the roof. Don't know, but here... .25 caliber. Mm. You wouldn't happen to have the gun this came from too, would you? Can't help you there, but I can get you her personal effects. - Okay. - All right. Yeah, we're kind of deadlocked with these guys right now. Semen could really have helped me. Sorry. There was spermicide, so whoever had sex with your victim used a condom. Had sex with or raped? Well, there was, uh, vaginal bruising, but because she was still a virgin, it's hard for me to say rape or not. - "Still a virgin"? - Yep. Man, I could really have used some semen. What you got? Only tried it on twice, I swear. It's gorgeous. Beautiful. I tried to untie the bracelet, but it's one of those you have to shower with it on, and the knot got wet too many times, so I had to cut it off. - Sorry about that. - No problem. - No diamonds here, huh? - Nope. Hey. Hey. I didn't mean to start anything. I didn't, okay? I know it was out of line, but... I was just talking. I like him... Matt. Don't pretend you don't know what I'm gonna say here. Rackets are a place where cops let their hair down. It's not for spouses or significant others. It's for mistresses and pieces on the side. And if, God forbid, a cop brings their real life to one, what do you, as a fellow cop, say to that person? - I wasn't trying to... - How about this? "How was your day? How you doing? "How are your kids? Is it hot enough out here for you?" That's it. Right? No matter how much you know about the other cop, no matter how much you want to jam them up, there is a code. It's beyond a code. It's a religion. All I can tell you is I'm sorry. If you were me, would you believe you? What are you doing? You're losing the bid. Shh. $68.51? What kind of cockamamie Mickey Mouse bid is that? What's going on? Oh, Mother of Mary, it's that bad? Let me see. How's it going in there with Oscar? It's not. The giants plus-5... That's my key pick of the week. - Calderon. - Don't worry. Sweeney's gonna kill us all over the doggone gumball machine anyway, so... What? What are you talking about? He was breaking and entering? Oh, you... At a wine store? You should've let him. No, I would love to see a junkie sell a case of Bordeaux. You shut up. Shut your mouth. No, no, Mike. Mike, Mike... I'm not... I'm not talking to you. - What is it? - Keep him down there. I'm gonna be there in a few. Can you do that for me, buddy? Thank you. I appreciate it. This hasn't happened since you transferred in, - has it? - No. Lou's extended family problems? That's not my family. That's my wife's family. Your wife, whose taste in men before she met you could best be described as felonious. That is my daughter and my son's father, okay? Their real dad... He got problems. I keep an eye out sometimes. Every time. Lou, baby, Merry Christmas. Okay, right there... That's an unsealed juvie record of one Benjamin Ortiz, aka Benny, who... according to the state of New York, has been known to rape women. Ooh! Needed that, baby. What do you got for me? Oscar Cabrera... he's a serial thief. He's a shoplifter. He's very annoying. But get this... The youngest one in there... The kid, Emilio... The kid's got a rap sheet. He's been popped twice for possession with intent to sell... No jail time, community service. Little brother does weight. No, no, no, no. More like the older brother got Emilio to take the charges for him, knowing the kid would skate - for being a minor. - Oh, no! - What? - It's gone up to $70. The wheels are coming off. Fix this. Fix it. - Hey, guys? Work? - What do you mean, "fix it"? You want to get to work? I feel very disconnected from my life. Oh. Well, it's a rough spot you're in. - I don't blame you. - And you would know, right? You see people like me a lot. - Mm-hmm. - And I bet... You look at them the way you're looking at me right now. Well, you get it, right? I mean, the money, her being older than you... That much older than you. Not that your wife wasn't an attractive woman. She was very attractive, but you're, you know... More so. Then there's your employment record... - Which doesn't exist. - Right. Because I've lived off of an older woman, and I've done it for most of my life, even before Meg. But you didn't marry any of the others. I'm a detective. Yeah, well, I guess you would know. I get along with most people. I even like most people. But I've never loved anyone else in my life, just her. Well, I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Coleman. I really am. Thank you. Oh, I almost forgot this. Here you go. They're very beautiful. I'm usually not into that sort of thing, but... They are beautiful. Yeah, I didn't buy them. I put them on her finger, but she bought her own engagement ring, wedding ring... She didn't care. She said what they meant was what mattered. And what they meant to us was love... Real love. And that sounding exactly like something you would expect a man like me to say to you right now - doesn't make it not true. - I know. Can... can you get out of the apartment for a few hours tonight so my colleagues and I can come back and take another look around? Would you mind? Sure. Wow, this is quite a rap sheet you got here, Benny, considering the fact that you're a minor, huh? Sexual abuse charges, attempted assault charges. Can you read that? Rape in the first degree. That's old news, old man. Right. You were a kid. You're 20 now. That ain't gladiator academy. That's state prison. So arrest me. I'm trying to give you a chance so that you can explain yourself on this, okay? You guys were in the sack. She touched you where it hurt... Stuff like that. You got to give me something so people can understand. - You're asking the wrong guy. - No, I'm not, Benny. I'm asking you. Look, it's fine. It's fine. Whatever explanation you give wouldn't matter anyway. You know why? 'Cause when the jury sees this, they're gonna know exactly what you did, okay? They're putting you away. You're going to jail. You're gonna go to Clinton this time, okay? You're gonna be there with bad guys, and they're gonna do to you what you did to Christina. So, Oscar... This girl you won't admit you know has your semen in her. You're a liar, man. Why, because you know you wore protection? Well, I got news for you... Valuable, important, life-changing news... Rubbers leak. Lucky for you, I like the sound of my own voice, because listen, this DNA thing isn't even the best part. Your boy Benny, he gave you up for the whole thing... Rape and murder. That's the best part. Don't apologize again. I don't want to hear it. Somebody's got to come at Oscar Cabrera from another angle. I can't get it done. I'm blowing it. Pretty soon the door's gonna close, both from a time standpoint, and also, he's getting the upper hand. - Is that his file? - Yeah. - Where is he? - Interview "A." Mrs. Lopez. I want to know what you're doing about Christina. We're working on it, Mrs. Lopez. And I promise, as soon as we know anything, we'll call you, all right? You don't have to call me. I'll be right here. You can tell me. Hmm. Theft. I already told the other guy I got nothing to say. I didn't ask you anything, did I? What's with that guy's problem, anyway? All skinny and creepy, talking about like he know stuff. He doesn't know nothing. Yeah, that's why he lies. What? He lies... To get you to talk... That's what cops do. Yeah. No, I know. Just never heard one admit it. So what did he lie to you about? I don't know... a lot of stuff. Cops have to lie when they're being lied to by people who have something to hide. I hope you understand that. Hey, I like your bracelet. It's not a bracelet... Just some string. Just string, huh? Some string like the string Christina was wearing. See, I was at the morgue today, and I saw it. They cut it off her body and gave it to her grandma. She doesn't have Christina anymore, but she has a bracelet. She make it for you? I think she did. I think she was your girlfriend, and I think she made one for her and one for you. Am I right? Did you kill your girlfriend, Oscar? Did you rape and kill her? She wanted to wait. I didn't do anything to her. Then who did? Well? Well, do you have any physical evidence that ties Oscar - to the rape and murder? - No. I don't know who it is, but it's not him. Sorry. Duff, Duff. Yo, take these damn cuffs off me. You brought me in for questioning. Yeah, yeah, okay. Your fingerprints were all over Christina's purse, - not to mention the trash chute. - Man, that means nothing. Yeah, you know what it means, buddy? It means you're staying with us tonight. What? Hell, no, I ain't staying here. - Get back here! - No! Hey! Hey, hey! You can't arrest him for something I did it. Me... I killed the girl. I know it's hard to believe. It's hard for me too. He's just a kid. But, hey, he told you what he did. He confessed. There it is. And that little Mami, man... She used to drive him crazy, yo. The way she used to shake her ass all around him, right? Like he's just a little kid, like he wasn't even there. I guess he just got so mad, he snapped. That's a strong little dude, yo, to be able to lift her up and carry all that weight and everything. I never thought he could step to that, man. I guess you just never know what's gonna happen, huh? Nice talking to you. Lou! Lou, over... over here. Lou. Lou. Hey, man, Lou. Hey. Stop saying my name. You got it, man. You got it... whatever you want. Listen, thank you for coming down, okay? - Stop talking to me. - You got it... Whatever you want, man. Look, I'll never do it again, okay? - Absolutely... - Shh, shh, shh! Sit down. Sit down. Okay, I want you to think about your kids... my stepkids. I want you to see their faces, 'cause that is the only reason why I'm here. Can you do that for me? - Mm-hmm. - Shut your mouth? - Shutting up. I'm shutting up, Lou. Thank you, man. - Hey, Augie? - What if he dropped the gun out of the window, then crime scenes would have found it. Well, look, maybe Coleman didn't drop it, right? Maybe he threw the thing. Yeah, which is why I had them look across the street too. It wasn't in the apartment. So, since the closed-circuit cameras didn't catch Coleman leaving the building that night, where did he hide ththe son-of-a-bitchin' gun? I don't know. Okay? And, look, maybe I'm just saying this because I'm freezing my nurts off, but I really don't think he hid it up here. Fine. You have a better idea? What? If you fall asleep for real, I will shoot you for real. I will take your toe off. - Jane, I'm not sleeping. - Okay. Then we got to do this. I was up late. I was watching the Charles Bronson marathon. Okay, it doesn't matter. We're asleep. 2:00 A.M., The Mechanic came on... We're asleep. We're both asleep. Reenactment... I'm on it. Let's go - I get up. Okay, I have to pee, so now I get up. - I go to the bathroom. Okay? - Yes. I'm over here. Take a pee, wash my hands. Okay. So, wash my hands. All right, and then I get up. - What do you do? - Ok?? I waitilill your back is turned, and then blam-o! No wrong angle. You have to be higher. Okay, how high? - Like toilet high. - Like this? Like this Jane? - Like this is what hapappened. - Really? - This could have happened... - Okay, how about this? He comes to the door, right? He's like, "Get down on your knees." - She puts up her arms. - I can't do this. I'm, like, dying. It's like a sauna in here. I have to open... Don't move! What? Wait. Wow. You know what's funny? All this money, and they can't get the radiators to work right. Kind of restores my faith a little bit. - Faith in what? - I don't know... Things that are awesome. Take off your coat. It's too puffy. It's freezing. Why couldn't she have been killed in summer? Hey, don't get handsy, mister. I don't know what that means. Lift up your arm. No squirming. Chicks must really love this. All the time. Now don't move. Stay. Take a look. Look at that, Augie. That's frickin' incredible. - Wow. - You're like a wizard. - Hello, there. - Hi. I'm Detective Timoney. This is Detective Blando. I'm sorry to bother you, Miss... Morris. What's this about? We had a report of a gunshot in this building. Oh, well, we don't own any guns. Can we... can we come in for a minute? - Sure. - Thank you. Hi. - Oh, hi. - How are you? So did either of you hear a gunshot last night or early this morning? No, I didn't hear anything. You, Robyn? If I did, I didn't know that's what it was. What about you, hon? Did you hear anything? No? So nobody here heard anything. You know, you wouldn't necessarily know that it was a gunshot. It might have sounded like a... Like a truck backfiring, perhaps, or... Something like that. - Yeah, I-I'm sorry. This report you got about a gunshot... Where did that come from? Somebody in this building? No, we actually got a report from the building across the street. - Hey, Augie? - Yeah? - Wait. W-what are you doing? What is she doing? Sir, just give me one second. - What is she doing in here? - What is it? I'm sorry. This is a new pane of glass, isn't it? Yeah, Erica broke it bouncing a ball like she's not ever supposed to do in the house, but she does it anyway. Right? - When was this? - Can we see it? Do you have the ball? - I-I don't know where it is. Because that's not what you were doing, huh? Okay, that's it. It's time for you to leave. Erica... It was a ball, wasn't it, that broke the window? Erica? What happened? I found it, coming back from school with Lila. It was under a bush in the park. The gun was. I didn't even think it was real. I put it in my bag, and then when I woke up, I was gonna give it to dad, but I started taking it out and looking at it, and it went off by accident. You found a gun? You had a gun here? - I'm sorry. - Oh, baby. Honey, it's okay. We got all day. Your brother's taken the weight for Benny before, hasn't he? Felony drug sales... He's 13 years old, gets a slap on the wrist. Here's something you don't know... And neither does he yet. This right here... Gets Emilio tried as an adult... 25 years to life. He's just a kid. This right here... This is rape and murder. You think the D.A. is even gonna let a little kid walk on that? The system is broken, but it's not that broken! You're supposed to look out for him, protect him. Now, maybe your parents are trash who left you, but you let him do this. You're worse! I told her to stay away from Benny, or he would do something bad to her! I told her not to ever be with him alone, ever! I'm gonna go cuff your brother right now... - What do I do here? - Take him down to booking... - What am I supposed to do? - Hey! Your little brother... he's got to start telling the truth, okay? Now, he's a minor. We can't talk to him without a legal guardian being present. So what, then? You found our mother? Satellites couldn't find your mom. What? It's you or nobody. You're 18. He lives with you. You feed him, pay his expenses. Guess what. You're his legal guardian. God help him. You got to do what's right... Not for the gang, not for Benny, but for Emilio. You think it's just about me, Benny, and Emilio? We're a set. And the set runs the neighborhood. And the neighborhood is the world. We walk out of here without Benny, we try to go anywhere without him... We're dead. What if there's somewhere else we can go? - A nine-year-old girl? Yes. She found it in the park. She didn't know how it worked, and it went off. Is she gonna be arrested? She'll go to family court, but I doubt it. She's so little. Yes. I don't even get to be mad, do I? Sure you do. You get to be mad at whoever dropped that gun and ran. All I can think is... A few inches in another direction, that kid takes a different street home, Meg wakes up a little earlier or later, and... I would have never met you. I really, really wish I had never met you. Me too, Mr. Coleman. Listen, Emilio, tell them. Tell them the truth. Just listen to your brother, all right? - Hey, tell them the truth. - All right. I just got off the phone with a friend of mine. He's an A.D.A. down in Atlanta, and he owes me big. Now, I'm willing to call that favor in for the two of you. You just got to tell me what you know, okay? The truth. Listen, end of the week, you guys get new names. You get new addresses. You get a little start-up money, whole new life in Atlanta. Benny, the gang, reprisals, looking over your shoulder... gone. - For real? - For real. - Shut up. - Emilio... Think about this, okay? You want to spend the rest of your life behind a cement wall? Huh? You want to worry about your manhood? You want to worry about your life? For what? For something you didn't do? I did it! This ain't the same as carrying weight for possession. He's telling the truth, Emilio. He's telling the truth. How do you know? You their bitch now? You wouldn't do it, Emilio. - I did do it. - You wouldn't. - I did. - You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't, Emilio. You wouldn't, Emilio. She was your friend. You would never. She taught you your alphabet, washed your school clothes in the sink. And I loved Christina. And you would never do that to her. Not being able to stop Benny, that wasn't your fault. There's nothing that you could have done. You didn't do anything. I did. I did. I just... He told me to shut up and help him. I said no. But he said if I didn't, I'd be next. So I held the door open to the garbage, and I helped him carry her. I'm sorry. You did good. All right. You did good. Come on, come on, come on. No, no, no! Hey, Augie. How we doing on that gumball machine? We're not. I just got outbid. - The auction is over. - What? - Shh. - Okay. - You know what? This is good. - No. I have been outbid, but I have not been outplayed. I'm going rogue. What? Hey. - Hey, where my lawyer at? - He's running late. Yo, open it up. Hey. Let's go. Come on. So I got your pathetic attempt at a B & E knocked down to a desk appearance ticket. You will be doing community service, okay? You will be coming to my house Sunday to pick up your kids. You're gonna be wearing a collared shirt, and you will spend quality time, not in a bar. - You get it? - Yeah. I get it. I get it, Lou. I get it, and I-I-I'm gonna do right. You know what? You... you always get it. You always get it until you don't. You are something, Dwayne. Somehow you conned the best woman that I ever met in my entire life into giving you kids that I wish every day were mine. Why can't anything else you do be smart? Huh? Please... Get out of my day. See ya Sunday. Yeah, I'll see ya Sunday. That one? I know him since he was ten years old. He was garbage then, and he's garbage now, - you know, just a piece of... - It's all right. I know you! I know you! Mrs. Lopez, it's all right. We'll take care of him now. You don't have to worry about him, all right? I'm sorry. I didn't know he was gonna be... That's my fault. You all right? Sorry about that. And, you know, if there's anything else we can help you with or you need anything... You served my Christina well. You gave us what we needed. Well, thank you. And, uh, you let us know what day you're planning the funeral, because there's a lot of us here who want to come, pay our respects. - I-it probably won't be a thing that people can go to, you know, the funeral. I mean, I-I don't have a lot of things that I can put my hands on. But I-I'll let you know. Okay, I understand. Yeah, sure. You just let us know. Hi. Mrs. Paula Henriss? Yes? I'm looking for a Mr. Marshall Henriss. My dad left us all kinds of junk, clogging up the basement. Idiots out there actually want to pay money for any of it, I am certainly not gonna stop them. - Sorry. - It's okay. I'm an idiot. I'm comfortable with it. Where's Mr. Henriss? Marshall! Oh, you got to be kidding me. Licensetothrill007, I presume. - Yeah. - Yeah. Saurian-Brandy-hangover. Wait. What? How'd you find me? Son, in my day job, I'm exquisitely fair, but when it comes to things like this, I am not. So let's just agree that whoever outbid me on that damn hell-beast of a gumball machine, oh, they're about to be very, very disappointed. Ante up for Mrs. Lopez. Good man, Reg. Coming through. Oh, thank God. Christina Lopez's grandma can't afford a funeral. Give me money. I read once how the German military went to spy on this radical group, so they send this guy to the meetings to find everything out. But this guy likes what he hears, so he joins the National Socialist Workers Party. But if the German army had sent someone else instead of Adolf Hitler... This world would be a very different place. Randomness is terrifying, I tell you. Damn right. That's like catching an earlier flight that crashes. Or remember my, uh, cousin's husband... when the pipe fell off the truck? - Yeah. - Went through his windshield, took his head clean off... True story. Or a little girl finds a gun. It goes off and shoots a woman she doesn't even know. If I didn't believe in God, it would make me want to invent him. How come I can't get gum out of this. Oh! Oh, my! - What did you do? - Oops. - Oh, my God. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Hey. - You know what? No, not this time. Hey. That's not me. That's not me. - Hey! - I'm not cleaning nothing. I'm not going out like that. If I go out, I'm taking you all with me. You hear me?
