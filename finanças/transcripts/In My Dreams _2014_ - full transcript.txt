I'm worried about the restaurant. It's missing something. Um, customers? Nobody is excited when they come in anymore. You see the looks on their faces. It's just... Yeah, "Is this place still here?" Okay, so the restaurant's reliable, but it's not surprising. So what would surprise you? Hmm. Customers. I never liked you. I tolerate you, but I never actually liked you. Here you go. Let me show you what I have in today. This fountain was built in 1903 by Mortimer Hayward... So, Beekman's changing the design again? Oh, for heaven's sakes. It's Saturday. When-when's he expecting it? I wish you spent as much time on your personal life. Mom, I go on plenty of dates. First dates. Hey. Your father and I are about to have our 40th wedding anniversary. You know why? Hmm? Because he asked me out on a second date. Sorry, Joe. You don't have that much time, you know. Your father started going bald young. Oh... Hold on. Mom, Dad has hair. Well, that's debatable. Oh, no, no, it's my mom harassing me about my love life again. Oh, yeah, well, if there was ever a reason to come into the office on the weekend... I've handed out flyers to local office buildings, social media promotions, donations to local events to raise the profile. Okay, Nat, we've been friends for a long time, so I think I can tell you this without hurting your feelings. Lose the opera. When you walk in the front door, there's, like, this wall of opera that greets you. My mom loved the opera. Yeah, well, your mother also loved customers. Look, I know this restaurant is your family legacy, I get it, but... it just hasn't been the same. I know. Don't you think I know that? That's why I have the new chef coming. I just hoped after six months, I'd be able to find that, you know, just... I don't know. Magic? Yeah. I... I thought maybe I could find that. Oh, my goodness, is that Lori Beth? Who? Lori Beth Wacker from seventh grade, remember? Hey. Lori Beth! Hi. Hi. Oh! Oh... How wonderful to see you. Yeah. Your mother told me you were back in town. Yeah. Lori Beth. Nick! Hi. How are you? Oh, I moved back into town a couple months ago. It's so great to see you. How long has it been? 15 years. Oh, wow. My one true love... and my biggest regret, losing touch with you when we moved, but... but how serendipitous. You know, Nick is a big-time architect now. Oh. He designs bridges. Nick, give her your card. Well, you always did want to build things. Change the world. I wouldn't exactly say I'm doing that yet, but... Lori Beth works in landscape design. Oh. Mm-hmm. Architect, landscaper. Isn't that kismet-y? Ooh, speaking of work, I'm actually just on my way in now, Oh. but hey, really, really good to see you, Lori Beth. Yeah, you too, Nick. I would totally call you. Great. We have a lot to catch up on after all this time. You do, you do. Yeah? So do, call him. Okay, I will. I will. Bye! Bye. Bye. We just happened to run into each other? What a coincidence. You know, life is full of them, even if sometimes you have to give them a little push. I feel really badly you aren't making any tips. Do you want to quit? I want you to quit. Quit thinking that you have to keep the place just like it was when your mother was alive. I am so sorry, Nat. I didn't... No, no, it's okay. It's just that... If I don't move forward, I'm gonna lose the restaurant. I mean, it's stuck in the past, and so am I. Come on. Grandma! Uncle Nick! Hey. Oh! Kiddos. Hi. Look at these. Ooh, I like these. Very... Are we late? We had to take a detour to the girls' favorite store, the house of neon and sparkle. That's not what it's called. No, that's okay. Mom found a way to introduce me to yet another future daughter-in-law. Oh. Lori Beth Wacker. Hmm. He used to be crazy about her. - I was 12. - Grandma, can we have a quarter to make a wish? A quarter? In my day, it was a penny. Well, don't look at me. I spent all my money at the house of neon and sparkle. That's not what it's called. Really? Quarters. Uncle Nick's got quarters. Let's do this. Yes! All right. We're going wishing. Let's do it. You're gonna regret it. Oh, those are pretty. Maybe I should get these for the restaurant. Good morning, ladies. Hey. A bouquet to brighten your day? Yeah, they're lovely. They're $5.99, each bouquet. Oh, okay, um, I will take these. Here you are. Oh, no, it's okay. No, she'll take it. No, no, it's fine. Just take it, would you? Thank you. Um, I'm sorry. What are you doing? Okay. All right, here. You need this. W-Wish for a surprise. Okay, turning a restaurant around doesn't happen by magic. Okay, so then if you knew the surprise would come true, what would you wish for? Well, you are always bugging me about my love life, so... Penny for you? Ah, I have everything I could've ever wished for. If I had a wish for you however... Oh, you'd wish that I'd be spared a receding hairline. I'd wish that you'd get over her. I know what you felt about Jessa, but you need to move on, honey. You need to find the right one. ♪ ♪ I bet my wish comes true before yours does. Oh, it's almost 11:00. We got to buzz. Bye, honey.

I mean, seriously. I just find that hard to believe. What guy does that? A 44-year-old man. I guess. Hey, I saw that. I saw that. If the city went solar, you connect that bridge to the grid. Now it gets the power when it needs it, gives the surplus back when it doesn't. Want to tell him that? Mr. Beekman, sir. Good morning. Well, thanks for coming in over the weekend. A deadline is a deadline. We understand, George, and not to worry. I'm gonna give it the old Beekman touch. That's why the planning commission comes to you, Lance. We know you get it done. Beekman ever introduce you to a client? Not a chance. So, where is he? I'm not sure. He was supposed to fly in yesterday. If he doesn't arrive, I can cook. Oh, um, thanks, Damien, but maybe you could just refill the salt and pepper shakers. Sure. Buongiorno. Oh. And there he is, our new chef. Natalia? Uh, what-what is he saying? Oh, um, that, um, he thinks I'm a radiant beauty. That's sweet. Well, you're not so bad yourself. I'm Sharla with an "A," which is like Italian already. Yes, yes, you just keep looking at me, whatever your name is, with those dark chocolate eyes. His name's Mario. Mario. I thought you said he was an old guy from Italy. This is not an old guy. Well, I just hope he can cook, because I took on faith from my Italian relatives that he was good. Hi. Uh, mi dispiace. I'm sorry I wasn't able to greet you at the airport yesterday. Um, I don't know how to say all of that in Italian. Uh, it's no problem. I-I feel the warmth of your welcome, okay, Natalia? Hmm? And he speaks English. Uh, I cook for tonight? Yes! Let me show you the kitchen. Okay. So, it's a pretty basic kitchen. Um... Stupid. Anybody here? Hello? Hey. No, Mom. I told you, you didn't need to bring lunch. I just wanted to make sure you have a decent meal. Hiya, Joe. Hi. Something in here for you, too. I love your mom. Hmm. Did, uh, Nick tell you that we ran into his ex-girlfriend? Oh. The love of his life. Oh, yeah, when I was 12. Then she moved away and broke his heart. No, I was 12. His first kiss. When you were 12. Picked up on that? I want you to take her out. No, Mom, you're a world-class mother. I love you. How many times have I told you, do not fix me up? You... Stand-up night at the Comedy Cellar. Tomorrow, 8:00. Lori Beth loves to laugh. It's a date. Oh... I made it for you. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, but there's only two here. I mean, are you sure you didn't mean to buy three, in case you wanted to sit with us? You could interfere some more. Can I? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's extra mustard in the bag, Joe. Dude, your mom is the best. Hey, do you think Lori Beth's got a friend? Do not disappoint me. Maybe she's your fountain wish come true. No-no-no-no-no. Okay, my wish was to win the Green Bridge Award. Dude, come on. Not so loud. If Beekman finds out... How's everything? It's not the same. It's better. Oh, uh, wonderful. Great. I'll let the chef know. Really marvelous. I think it's great. Is this a new dish... Where's the garlic? Right. They love the food. Che cos' è? What do you look for? Uh, one of our regulars likes extra garlic. Che? For the alfredo sauce. I know it's weird, but it's just like... Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, don't worry, it's not you. It's just his thing. He just... His thing but is not my thing. What? Wait, Mario... The alfredo sauce. Mario! Buonasera. Hello. Extra garlic? Please. Bene. Extra more, huh? Huh?! Whoa. Whoa-whoa- whoa-whoa! Huh? Oh, wow. What he means is he really just appreciates your suggestion for extra garlic. Yeah, I said you eat like a pig. Mm. Okay. No, no, no! It's on the house...

Uh, Lori Beth, I, uh, really appreciate you coming out with me. Sure made my mom happy. That's not why I'm here, Nick. I thought maybe there'd be something between us. I always wondered about you. But we're back together now. I even updated my online status to "In a relationship with Nick Smith." W... maybe you should delete that. Are you breaking up with me? Well, it's-it's not breaking up with someone if you were never together. Look, I've just come through something really intense with someone and... That was great, Nat. Thanks, Sharla. Good night. Buonasera, Mario. Ciao. Thanks, Natalie. Good night, Damien. Have a good night. You, too. Natalia... Mm-hmm? The... the limoncello in the tiramisu. Eh, not the original recipe, però it's not too bad.

The mains we'll just keep tweaking, but, um... Hey... keeping tweaking! Okay, Natalia, you teach me how to cook, eh? No... No, no. Natalia teach Mario, it's okay. No, it... It was a... it was a good night, Mario, so, um... let's get some sleep. Catch some sleep. You will catch some sleep you know, get... you... I mean, you go home and I'll...

Good, there it is. Yeah, I can see it. They built it already? How is that even possible? It's marvelous. You're talented. That's how. That must be amazing. To... create something and... have it made real. It's not so scary up here. No. My mom used to say... "Spread your wings, Natalie." Mm... You smell like something good. Amaretti. I was baking today.

Ah, Mario, another excellent night. Thank you. Buonanotte. Ciao. Yeah. Buonanotte, Mario. - Thanks, guys. Good night. - Bye. See you. Bye. Okay, not even a wink or a peck for poor Mario? Are you having that dream again with Justin Timberlake, but better? Two nights in a row. Oh, boy. I know, but he's exactly who I'd be with in real life if I could. Yeah, why can't I have dreams like that? I'm with him and I have these feelings like I've always known him. And he knows me. And I'm in this total state of fantasy. I know, I'm probably... definitely going crazy. But I can't wait to go to sleep tonight so I can maybe see him. Am I losing it? Yeah, maybe. I mean, what do you, what do you do if you feel like you've found "the guy"? Only he's a figment of your imagination, and there isn't any chance you'll ever meet him because you made him up? And... and then what if, when you're dreaming, your life is so much better and you never felt more awake? Well, I'm thinking that you... should get some sleep. ♪ ♪ Oh, this is crazy.

The legend says you toss a coin, and for seven nights... you dream of your true love. And if, in the end, you really love him, the spirit of the stones will make him real. That's... that's pure fantasy. Did it happen for you? Take my advice: find yourself a real, live guy and save yourself the heartache. Within a short period of time, the beaver has found water, created ponds and found peace in the dangerous and harsh ecosystem. Hello? Hello. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. Here I am.

It's just... it's not real. Here I go again. Another night, we're just going around and around and around. I'm tired of this. It's unrealistic. The more I... the more I see you, the harder this gets. Yeah, but you just said that it feels so good. Yes, I did. But it's just an illusion, okay? Even if this... this legend is real, it's... it... we only have one more night. What legend? Seven nights, seven chances to... dream about you. And then it's over. Okay, but it's not over. Not yet. Hoping won't make it happen. Stop. Every time we touch, I wake up. Exactly. You are everything I ever dreamed of, but you don't exist. So why am I going through this? I have to move on. I... S-Stop. No, I have to move on. Don't look for me tomorrow night.

In fact... if I were to leave the firm... Hang my own shingle... Would you go with me? Shh. Are you... You have any idea what that takes? To rustle up clients, to get a space, hire employees, pay the... pay the bills? I know, I know. And it's gonna be rough, but I-if I win this thing, it's gonna generate a lot of interest. You're counting on that, Nick? Geez. Joe, we are getting crushed here. The level of competition for that award is ridiculous. So you don't think that I can win? No, I didn't say that. No. I need those papers in my office. Okay, let me ask you this: Are you okay here? No, are you... are you okay giving everything that you have just to perfect the old Beekman touch?

Put me out of my misery. I called the TV station and invited that food critic to eat here. Rodney Sims? Yeah, we're ready, Nat. And if he hates us, he... he'll dig us in a hole so deep we won't be able to climb out. Sharla. Yeah, w... He-he won't. Because... he can't. This is your big dream, Nat.

All right, you... and you, outside, let's go. Just pay no attention. Well, now you did it. You're clearing out the room. Those are my good kids. You know what keeps me going, Nick? At my age? What's that? Heart. Without the heart there can be no passion. No passion? No life. I count my blessings that Charlotte is my passion, my heart, and my life. May it be the same for all of you. It's about that time. Happy anniversary. Thanks, sweetheart. Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary. Happy anniversary. Thanks, honey. You got it. Can I interfere? Well, Mom, you're always interfering. We know this about you. Your sister says that you avoid committing to someone because you think you can never have the relationship that your father and I have. Mom, what you and Dad have is amazing. Yeah, of course I'd love to have that someday, but I just haven't been lucky. Then you wait. You don't settle for less. You've dreamt of the girl, now all you have to do is go out and find her. Y-You can't find a fantasy. That's not what I mean. Don't be so literal. Oh, I don't know. There's always the old Hayward legend. Maybe you can dream yourself up a hottie. I'm sorry, what? Don't listen to your father, he thinks he's funny. No, no, no. You know, the legend of the Hayward Fountain. Where people throw coins into the fountain and then for seven nights they dream of their true love. Isn't that the way it goes?
