The World The Flesh And The Devil Back on, station A, this is Burton, I'm at the 3rd level, tunnel 8, where the old tunnel comes in. Do you read me? Over. Read you clear, Ralph. What's the state down there Is that where the seepage is coming from? Over. Looks that way. It's kind of wet down here. I can see why this old tunnel was closed off for so long. A lot of water coming in all the time... Man, if anything was ever to go wrong down here there'd be... Trouble ! I'm getting out ! The pump's workin'... I have enough trouble without drowning. The telephone ! It's Ralph Burton down at tunnel 8. Can you hear me, Bertha ? I'd like to put a call in to the president of the company. A small complaint 'bout the way he's running things. Not much, about thirty, forty thousand words, you know... While we're at it, we might as well get a new phone down here. This one's had it. Don't know if you can hear me, but,there sure isn't enough left of this thing for me to hear you. Hey, if that means that you can hear me, rap again, ha? No, no, give me three, three, then two !

Five days is all I know. Five days I've been down here! I don't know what's going on up there, but I wish you'd get moving! Doesn't seem to me like they're digging as hard as they were.

You too rear...on the circuit, i have to get... Ok, White House staff, New York near the end now. We're sick here, there were plenty of us this morning, about five now. San Francisco went off last night, Chicago right after. Nothing left alive between here and there. White House staff this is full report, probably final. Rio de Janeiro just getting first clouds of isotope dust One information regarding.... The White House staff's not answering ! - It's gone now ! - Go on keep going now, try again... Rio... This is New York... It began seven days ago when the walk out in the U.N. started. It is still not known what nation started using radioactive sodium isotope. Tonnes of radioactive dust released at the upper atmosphere, circling the Earth. Sodium isotope, halflife 53 hours, deadly for about 5 days. No defense against it. Three days ago, first clouds of dust reached the United States, now in New York The city is completely evacuated now, but no use to run. It's everywhere now, everywhere in the world. Last official act of the U.N.was to order all nations to reconvene. Too late, no place to go. Forget it, the White House staff off circuit, so no answer What do I do, go on? Talking to yourself, that's all. Get off, go home or something... All these years Listen, what do I do about the equipment here, the generator room is still operating Do I leave it or what Frank? Frank? Anybody there? Anybody? Just me. I'm here. Rough ride, Snodgrass ? Anybody hungry ? How 'bout you, Betsy ? You're lookin' kind of skinny lately. You haven't been getting your proteines. How 'bout you, Snodgrass ? Would you like a little stew ? Always smilin'... Nobody can be that happy. Betsy ? I hate to tell you this... Snodgrass is a friend of mine and I wouldn't do anything in the world to hurt him... But you're to good for him. Done layed around, Done stayed around... This ol' town too long. Summer's almost gone. Summer's almost gone. Done layed around, Done stayed around... This ol' town too long. And I feel like I want to travel on I've waited here, for most a year, Waiting for the sun to shine. Waiting for the sun to shine. Hopin' you'd change your mind. Waited here, for most a year Hopin' you'd change your mind. Now I feel like I ought to travel on. Well, the chilly wind will soon begin I'll be on my way. Gone a lonesome day. Going home to stay. Chilly wind will soon begin I'll be on my way. Cause I feel like I ought to travel on. What's so funny ? I'm lonely and you're laughing ? Do you know what it means to be sick in your heart... From loneliness ? You don't care do you ? No sense, no feeling. You look at me but you dont' see me. You don't see me, and you wouldn't care of you did ! Out you go my friend ! We've been together too long. And you've laughed at me once too often ! Hey, hey girl, wait! I'll be right down ! Hey girl, hey lady ! Where are you ? That's great. That's all I need is to start seeing people I did see you, you're real ! Don't touch me ! That's good. That's very funny. We're probably the only teo people left in the world, and all you can say is don't touch me. I'm afraid I can see that...Donn't worry, I won't touch you. I've been watching you for weeks now. Some of the things you do, I wasn't sure, I didn't know. You mean I've been acting crazy ? Well, why not ? This is a crazy world. And I thought I was all alone in it. Look, I live here, drop me a postcard sometime ! I thought you'd killed yourself ! it's too much for me. I'm all alone, my family, the whole world gone, and nobody to cry over it, except me. I cry sometimes too. I knew you were alive... I've known it ever since you came here. Somehow it made it easier for me, watching you. But I didn't know how to tell you there was someone else. Then, when I saw, when I saw that thing come crashing down, I thought it was you! And I felt as though I died myself without ever having anything to say about it. That was Snodgrass. I brought him home because he was smiling. After a while, he got on my nerves. - What's your name ? - Ralph. Ralph Burton. I'm Sarah Crandall. One L or two ? Two. Pleased to meet you miss Crandall. Likewise I'm sure. You know, I've got a million questions to ask you. You know, things like, how old are you? Where you're from? How'd you stay alive? When the first alarm came, we got into a decompression chamber. Three of us. Where are the other two ? They went out the second day. They're dead then. It's going to rain again. I guess I better go. Where do you live ? Near here. Will you be back ? I need you, Ralph Burton. I'm here. Hey, what day is this? April 9. What day of the week ? Sunday. It felt like sunday. - Hi, Ralph Burton. - Hi. It's about tme you came to see me. Well, I was going to suprise you. You're all hooked up to the generator, now you're gonna have lights. Thank you. I can see you've been busy ! Yes, I've been shopping. Service was terrible, but I got a few bargains. I'm all ready for spring. I think I'll do some shopping myself. Ralph, don't you think that... ? Oh, I mean, what do I do about the lights? When it gets dark, just turn the on. And remember, pay your bills promptly. Alexander Graham Bell, no doubt ! Oh, it works. You'll have the whole city working before you're through. The hardest part was getting the bell to ring. Turn on your radio. - What ? - Turn on your radio. This is New York, calling the world. There are two of us alive in New York city. This is New York calling. You are on. New York calling anybody. We will be on the air every day at twelve noon for messages. This is New York. Signing off. Sarah ? Did you hear it ? Sounded fine. No answer though. Don't get discouraged. It took you awhile to get it working it might take longer in other places. Maybe that's it. How 'bout inviting a nice girl over for lunch ? It's my turn to cook. Alright. I'll be there in ten minutes. Thanks for the phone. I keep waiting for people to come back. Keep waiting for it to happen. So I'm goofy. I miss bread. And milk... fresh milk ! With me it's mostly bread. Ralph ? Wouldn't it be easier if I moved into this building ? I mean instead of us going back and forth, And you trying to make both places run. It took you all month getting electricity into my place... If I were here... No. Why not ? People might talk ! Are you mad about something ? Yes. Why ? None of your business. Alright. Well, I figured it out on my slide rule. In exactly twelve years, four months and three weeks, The dishes will be up to here, and I'll have to move. Might be easier to wash them ? That requires water, and I'm tired of lugging it up here. You mean you've been lugging water up here, all this time ? Do you have a better idea ? The tank's on the roof, I thought you knew that. I did, but I kind of took it for grant... Water, what about that... So, you don't know everything after all. Well, that's a comfort. I was beggining to think you were superman ! How 'bout that... You know, I've been trying to find ways of pumping this up here... You know how much time that... Time ! As if there isn't enough time ! There's more than enough time ! I guess we're on the verge of quarreling. You and me ? What for ? I feel like it ! Look, if I've done anything to get on your nerves... What are you gonna do with these books ? I'm gonna save them, Like all the others on the floor below. Your gonna keep ... books in here 'till the whole builidng falls down. Somebody has to save them. I went down to the library. The roof's falling in. It's filled with water, All the books are getting wet and dirty. You ought to stay busy like I do. I'm free, white and 21, and I'm gonna do what I please. I shouldn't be giving you advice. I'm sorry. Now you're angry ! Well, at least we're talking. You know I always wondered what people would talk about when they got married, and they lived together for years and years. What do they talk about ? Marriage ! I'll never get married now, will I? No matter waht happens, I won't get married. There's nobody left to marry anybody... Don't, Don't do that. Please don't do that. Look I can do things, I can make things work, But I can't put everything back the way it used to be. There's no use crying over it. Oh, I know there isn't. I'll stop. Just keep talking. We'll find somebody for you... Somebody to marry I mean. Nous avons surv?cuYou lived thorugh it, I lived through it. There must be others. We'll find somebody... And I'll do the marriage. I'll be the Mayor. I'll be the Mayor, ok ? I've got the shortwave working,and I'll call the entire world until we find somebody. Only, you can't be too particular. You have take what you get.Ok ? We have to keep hoping, don't we ? As long as we're alive, the world is still alive. We're monuments, you and me. You're the best. A little damp right now, but... A very nice monument... This monument needs a haircut. - You don't think I'm gonna od it, do you ? - Yes I do. I'm not a barber. I tried calling Antoine of Paris, but he wouldn't answer. So, that leaves you. If you do a very nice job in back, I might even give you a large tip. Alright. Let's get at it. Remeber, I've got my eye on you. Look, ah... where do I start with this ? Anywhere. Are you sure about this ? Cut ! Be brave ! Cut more than that. It isn't a weed, you know? You're pulling my hair a little. I'm doing the best I can ! I know. Nobody cuts my hair. I have to do it myself, I put two mirrors together and I cut it myself! Don't get angry. Who's angry ? Why should I be angry ? Just beacuse I feel like an idiot with three hands ? Don;t look at me ! You make me nervous. Why ? Why ? "Why" ? Beacuse I'm not a barber, that's why ! Look, do it yourself. I've done the best I can, I can't do any better. Cut it the way you want. I've got a lot of things to do, a lot of things, and I can't be hanging around here all day. It's taking you too long to accept things, Ralph. This the world we live in, we're all alone in it. We have to go on from there. I don't know what you're talking about. You know me well enough to be honest with me. Don't push me ! I'll be so honest It'll burn ya ! I know what you are, if that's what you're trying to remind me. That's it alright. If you're squeamish about words, I'm colored. And if you face facts, I'm a negro ! And if you're a polite southerner, I'm a negra. And I'm a nigger, if you're not. I'm none of those things. Little while ago you said you were : "Free, white and 21." That didn't mean anything to you, just an expression you've heard for a thousand times Well to me it was arrow in my guts ! Ralph, what do I say, Help me ! I know you, you're a fine, decent man. What else is there to know ? That world that we came from, you wouldn't know that, you wouldn't even know me ! Why should the world fall down to prove I'm what I am and that there's nothing wrong with what I am. Look, we leave it the way it is and I won't mention it again, ok ? We haven't said anything about love, have we ? Hi. You came back. I went up the river, Almost to Albany. I was looking for signs of life. Nothing anywhere. Three days. You know what I thought all that time ? There was something on my mind. I had to get rid of it. I though you were dead or something. Now that's not right... Ralph. Anyway, I'm glad that you're back. Are we friends again ? What choice do I have ? Hey that's no way to talk to somebody when they've brought you a present! Today's your birthday, remember ? What kind of a present ? Something you haven't seen in a long time. Here you are, lady. Read all about it. So long. "Sarah Crandall has birthday." "New York city plans huge celebration ! Come one, come all !" "We regret to inform our readers that this is all the news there is." Calling URR from New York... New york calling. This is New York calling URR... Come in, anybody. Over. This is New York.

I'm the gest of honour, and I'd like to have the best table that you've got. Ofcourse, ofcourse. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen Welcome to the Camel oasis, now, a special birthday party in honour of miss Sarah Crandall. That's enough, that's enough. Now, for our entertainment ! First number's a song selected by Ralph Burton, featuring Ralph Burton as soloist, aAccompanied by Ralph Burton on the guitar, And applauded at the end by Ralph Burton personaly, in case nobody else does.

At fifteen, I saw her And though her so beautiful I... Kissed her, from a distance For my young love was locked inside... I thought you'd laugh. What about ? I'm sorry. I spoiling everything. Oh,it's such a lovely party. Your club looks beatiful. I'm suprised you don't have more customers. Word hasn't gotten around yet. Oh yes, that must be it. Meanwhile, shall we dance ? No. I'm being rejected... or maybe you don't dance ? Let's say that. I thought things were going to be different with us now ? I've got great news. A wonderful birthday present for you Sarah... Today on the shortwave I... got an answer. Others ? You mean there are others alive ? I don't know who or where... But it doesn't really matter. Sooner or later, we'll talk, and we'll find out. That's right, you and I are not alone in the world anymore. Civilisation's back. Does it really make that much difference ? You know it makes a difference, Miss Crandall. I have pride too, you know. Good night, Ralph. Happy birthday, Sarah. Yes, Sarah ? I was out in the warf and I saw a boat coming up the river. Woah, not so fast. I saw a boat in the river... - What do you mean a boat in the river ? - Yes, I saw a boat ! - Broken loose ? - No, it was under power, coming up the river. Under it's own power ? - That's what I'm trying to tell you Are you sure ? Did you see it plainly ? Where ? I'll be right there. Do you see anybody ? No, not yet. - Sorry I couldn't help you with the mooring. - That's alright. I've had it. Are there others ? No. We're the total population of New YOrk. That's Sarah Crandall, I'm Ralph Burton. I'm Ben Thacker... total population of the Southern hemisphere, Wherever I've been. I was the total population. I've been here an there the last six months. Something's the matter with you ? What if he dies ? He'll die anyway, If I don't do something. Dying's nothing. Maybe I'm thinking about what'll happen if he lives. You've got a choice. Not really... Very pretty... I've forgotten your name. Sarah Crandall, two Ls. I gather I'm alive. Apparently. How long have I been like this ? I mean out of focus ? Nearly a week. Ever since we found you. "We" ? Oh yes, I remember now... What's his name ? Ralph Burton. He saved your life. Where is this ? An apartment building. High rent district, I hope ? Very. And where's our friend ? He's on the floor above. This is his building. He'll be here soon. He makes a shortwave brodcats everyday at noon. Quite a guy Burton ! Yes. Which floor do you live on ? I don't live here. No ? I have a place of my own. I see... I'd rather live here, but he won't let me. Quite a guy. How do you look without a beard ? Well, you're not gonna shave me. Yes I am ! I say you're not ! Oh, I say I am! And you hold stil, because I'm not very good at this. Just in time to save my life all over again. Any luck on the shortwave? No, not since that one time. We got an answer one day, a few weeks ago, from somewhere in Europe. Well, then there are others alive ? Don't know how many, And I haven't had an answer since then. How are you feeling ? I think I'll make it. Oh, you'll make it alright. Your pulse is alright and your temperature went down this morning. I'm hungry, I'll tell you that. I'll fix something. Will you stay for lunch ? If you don't mind. I don't mind. Well... haven't seen you all week. Been mining again I gather, what new treasures have you saved? Maybe I'm foolish for saving things, but, don't laugh at me, ok ? Everybody to his own pleasure. Getting around alright ? He's doing fine. Today we're going to the park for a picnic. Come with us. There's enough for three. Sure, come along Ralph ! I'm pretty busy. I'll see you later. I get the impression he's deliberately leaving us alone together. I wonder why ? Why don't you ask him. I never press my luck. Let's take my private taxi cab here. I love to hear that meter ticking. So far, I owe 400 dollars and 85 cents. High cost of living. It's the first quarter mile that hurts... Poor slob ! All alone in the world. Here you are ! A little gift of instant flowers. Just add water and, presto, nothing happens! I'm sorry. It was a stupid remark. No, I never get used to things. Not everything anyway. You probably love flowers ? No, they made me sneeze. Isn't that funny. And now I feel sorry for them. You're a nice girl. You're a nice fellow. Oh, I used to be. I was even considered an idealist. Full of kind thoughts and good wishes for my fellow man... Then somebody somewhere pushed a button And I became an ex idealist. Nobody who says that is an ex. Well, one for your side. You're way ahead on points, as though you needed points. Why don't you ever look at me when I talk to you ? You see something in my eyes, waiting to be said , is that it ? You know a lot about women, don't you ? Were you ever married before ? Before all this ? Wife and two children... We lived on Sutton Place. That's not very far form here. No, I was there yesterday. It took a certain amount of courage I didn't find them, thank God. What about you Sarah Crandall ? Were you married or anything ? No, not married or anything. Sooner or later, we'll have to discuss that you an I... You and I and Ralph... I like Ralph. As far as I'm concerned, he's Mayor of New York.. What are you gonna do, when you grow up ? Oh, i don't know. I'll run for something... Maybe dog catcher. Will you vote for me ? I believe in a secret ballot. Well, in that case, you open it yourself.

WORLD LOVELIES TAKE FERRIS RIDE At New Jersey's Palisade Park, the ferris wheel spins With a galaxy of beauties, from all the countries in the world Candidates in the Miss Universe contest. A round ... of glamour girls, all riding high with hope of being chosen the loveliest girl in the world. For the camera man, a sight to behold these bathing beauties actually go into the water ! California, here they come! THE END I went through the vault, trying to find out what happened on those last few days. What went on. This is what I found. Everybody having a good time. Just seeing crowds again... Having a good time... A good time while it lasted... I need a drink. I'll get it. Ralph, something for you ? I'll have a ber if there's any... I'll have the usual. You know what I like. She knows what I like, alright. Up to a point anyway. You're getting better fast. Yes, nice of you to give me a clear field. You know, you remind me of a guy named Snodgrass. I never knew what was in his mind either. Something has to give. I already have. More than I have to. More than I want to. As much as i'm going to. Now we know, don't we ? I guess we always have. Wouldn't it have been easier if you let me die, Ralph? Now, why didn't I think of that ? This kind of conversation woulnd't go well in front of her, so I'll make it short. I'm talking to you. Some things work out, some don't. I'll leave it at that. I won't get in your way. But I won't geto out of your way. Is that fair enough ? Oh, it's fair alright. But is it the best thing ? Clocks mean more to me than they do to you. I was never much for the waiting game anyway. I don't like it. - I don't like fencing. - Alright then I'll put it on the line. I have nothing against negroes, Ralph. That's white of you. Don't shaft me. I won't hold still for it. I meant what I said. We have only one problem. There are two of us, and one of her. What are we gonna do about it ? Why don't you toss a coin ! Eat, drink, talk about women... make your plans and get everything settled. And let me know how I make out. If you can find me ! Wait ! Don't make me run ! I can't run yet ! Sarah, listen to me ! You have to be reasonable ! Don't touch me.I don't wanna be touched. Just leave me alone. What are we, animals in a pasture ! That's the way you act, as though I've nothing to say about it ? Ralph and I are facing something important. We're being honest about it. It wasn't easy for him to send me after you. He sent you after me ? Do you wanna kiss me ? Make love to me ? Then go ahead. Kiss me, make love. Make me forget everything. You're getting something ? It's hard to tell where. Frequency wandering all over. It's from far off though. Somewhere in Europe or South America. Where from ? The park !Not just one tree, I found five, all in bloom ! Life all around us, coming back ! You said it would. You knew it would. I better put these in some water. I haven't seen you in nearly... nearly two weeks now. Oh, has it been that long ? You know how long it's been. Well, I keep busy, you know. You know how it is, things to do, more all the time. We used to be friends. We'll always be friends. You're so clever, you get around everything. Just knowing each other isn't what I'm talking about. What are you gonna do, keep quiet the rest of our lives here ? Just keep quiet, and stay away from me, and not do anything ? Just see what happens ? There's nothing to do. And nothing to say either. Why not ? Because I love you. What if I decide to move in with Ben. He wants me to, he's asked me to. I thought about it. I had to think about it. I've been expecting it. The world goes on. You're very noble ! Sarah, go away ! Please go away ! I'm tired and you're pushing me to the edge of a cliff. Now, I'll wind up jumping if it keeps up this way ! I can't live with what's going on in my head ! You think all this is easy for me. You think there's nothing for me to talk over with myself, night and day, the nights are the worst. Listen to me, Ben Thacker is a good man. There's nothing wrong with him. The only thing he has against me is that I'm younger than he is. I understand that. I think I know what's best for you. I want him to have you. Sooner or later, someone will have to ask me what I want. It won't be me that asks. I like your house. I'm glad. I'm glad you're glad. He must have been doing something to the generator. He's always doing something to the generator. You though maybe something had happened to him. - I have to finish the dishes... - No, you don't. You didn't ask me here tonight to watch you do the dishes. Ralph says you're a good man. Are you ? It'll be a little difficult, chasing you around the furniture, on that basis. Do you think that's why I asked you here, to be chased around the furniture ? I put things lightly sometimes, beacuse that's my nature. Not because of anything else. One of the very few advantages of narrowing down the world this way, is that it reduces the topics of conversation. We don't have to play parlour games getting to the point. Women enjoy parlour games. I'll remember. Meanwhile: "Me man, you girl" How about it ? Isn't that a little crude ? I get crude sometimes. Especially when talking doesn't do any good. Are you in love with Ralph ? I don't know. - What about me ? - I don't know that either. Would you know if Ralph weren't around ? I don't have to answer all these questions. You're asking yourself the same things and you better find a few answers. I'm beggining to think the only answer is for me to go away myself. There are other men in the world, Ralph is begginig to talk to them on the radio. They're thousands of miles away, it'll be years before any of us get togehter. Meanwhile, they'll talk on the radio ! Tell each other sad stories of how they managed to survive What they're doing now to keep alive, and that's all. Just talk. Well I'm sick of talking. - Ben, don't. - The other night when I held you, I thought you'd come to life, for a few seconds at least. You knew I was a man, you knew what you wanted. I could force you. Could be easy... No one around to care if you scream. All the boyscouts out of town. Shall I force you ? Is that way ? It's a way of getting me to make up my mind. I'd decide then alright. But not for me, I gather ? Oh I'm sick of you both... You and Ralph. He doesn't know what he wants,and you don't think of anything else but what you want ! You're all that's left for either one of us ! You'll have to decide between us. I won't. Then I'll do it for you. Ben, what are you going to do ? What's all this ? we'll get to it. Right now I'm waiting for that phone to ring. No. Don't answer it. Let her think you're not here. Why ? I told her I was gonna settle all our problems. Right now she's beggining to think I meant something like this. You're having a bad time with her ? Oh, the worst. And I know why. I also know how to take car of it. This little game of yours won't work. You act noble, so I'll look bad. You pretend to leave us alone together. And all the while you're right at my elbow, looking over my shoulder, Laughing at me. You're everywhere, that's the trouble. Plotting and scheming, like some fancy kind of spider. I'm gonna change all that. What do you want from me ? Move on. See how things are in Chicago or San Francisco. I don't run so good. This and that i'll do, and I'm glad to do it, but running away is not my style. I guess I knew I couldn't scare you off. Wouldn't be any good anyway. I'd be waiting for you to change your mind and come back. I'd keep watching for you every day, around every corner. I'd have to go looking for ya. Well it's you or me. And now's the time ! World war 4 ? Yeah. Get ready for it ! Make no mistake. I'll kill you if push me to it. So long, Ralph. Yes, Sarah ? Ralph, I have to see you right away. Right away, Ralph. Alright. I'll be right there. I told you ! Get yourself a rifle ! I'm after you ! I'm waiting for ya ! Come and get me ! What are you waiting for ? Come on, Burton ! THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES, AND THEIR SPEARS INTO PRUNING HOOKS NATION SHALL NOT LIFT UP SWORD AGAINST NATION, nEITHER SHALL THEY LEARN WAR ANY MORE come on, Burton ! I'm waiting for you. Here I am Ben. Throw away the gun, Ben ! Get away ! No more of this ! It's all over ! Fight, damn you. Why won't you fight ? If you were afraid, I could do it ! I've been looking for you, all night. Are you hurt ? No, I'm alright. So is Ben. Where are you going ? I don't know. Anywhere, someplace... Ralph, you can't leave. I've got work to do. I'll save things, whatever I can. That's why I'm alive. Ralph, wait for me. You can't go. Ben ! Wait for us ! THE BEGGINING Subtitle translation : Morella
