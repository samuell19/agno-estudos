* ZENE GREY'S ROBBERS ROOST * Sheriff. Heesman and his pack are coming here. What do you want, Heesman? They serve drinks here, right? It is better to forget. Hank Hayes is here. I didn't know you were so thirsty. For a nest of thieves. I'm still riding, to a nest of thieves. Hayes! We have a visit. Do not go. I'm warning you both. I don't want you to settle any disputes here. Buy me a drink. With the money earned from my cattle? Your cattle... I would like to see the bill. You too, Sheriff? Better to seek help. Heesman, I don't want you to continue to owe me. Let's play cards. Let's play for the cattle you stole. It's a good sum. Can you cover? This is not enough for a night of drinking. Blackjack. A poker hand. Done. Don't get on my back, sir. If you were still behind, you would tell me what you have in your hand. I don't know about the hand, but there's an ace up my sleeve. Don't draw your weapon. You are not that quick with the cards. I imagine not even with a gun. Your problem is with me, Heesman. Draw the weapon against me. There will be time for that. I now have a better thing to do. Strange, you've been trying your luck. Heesman is the second fastest after me. Do you think, that was merciful? Or you were bluffing. Why didn't you shoot? We were on your side. I never killed, a man just because I could. I think exactly the opposite and I will live longer than you. A drink? Come everybody! Happy Jack! What? Sing something for us. He could have been rich, he could have millions of pesos. It could be the owner of this city. Do you know of any work around here? You need a plan, huh? A job. Maybe I can use it. I will work as foreman for Bull Herrick Owner of the biggest land here. Was he hired as foreman? There are many cuatreros out there. We will protect six thousand head of cattle... the best quality, that you've seen. Six thousand, huh? You can trust me to do my part. He's hired, stranger. My name is Tex. Come on, honey. We didn't come here to talk about work. We'll be back at the ranch tomorrow. Choose a girl, any one but this one. Women are not my weakness. What are you running from, then? See you in the morning. Tex. When most do nothing, it is easy to deceive me. I don't know how to shoot. It could be bigger, but I didn't want to... But I didn't want to... Good horse you have. Yes. Is it fast? It is necessary to be, in our work. If my horse goes limp, I want one of these for myself. Where did you buy it from? Good one night half, a dozen appeared. They put the reins, in our hands. Yes, they always do that. Heesman. Six thousand heads like these. Nothing prevents us from taking them. Nothing will stop us this time. Come on. This time, the Sheriff is not here. Go on. Heesman! Get out of here! Get out of here, I told you! Hey! Come here! All... Keep your weapons. Keep your weapons! Come here. There is no need, to spend bullets. Save the bullets for the thieves. What's he doing here? It works for me. Ah, traitorous rustler. You didn't mention that when you hired me. If I had, you wouldn't have accepted it. Let me understand. Where does he enter? Mei hired him as foreman, so I moved here. It doesn't change anything. Each will be responsible for his men. Even the leather of the boots is at risk with it here. I'm happy to see how you respect them. I was not hired to work with him. Very well, Mr. Herrick. Let him go. While you're in that wheelchair, you can count on us. I thought you would understand. If you want, I can swallow this guy. Very loyal of you. You have a good reputation. No cuatrero will want to face them. Who is he? One of mine. It's new. Tex. Mr. Herrick. Tex, huh? Tex, what else? Only Tex. I asked you what else. Tex is not going to get you in trouble, Mr. Herrick. He doesn? like drink, women or music, but he's good with the gun. Right, Heesman? Perhaps. A gunslinger who doesn't like women? How's that? It must be because they ask a lot of questions. Like me? Yes We will get along. Your first job will be to receive the train tomorrow. My sister comes in it. Go on without the women liking you. And that goes for all of you. Did you say that to my brother, Dr. Beebe? Yes. No wonder they call him Bull. He just needed to get me off the ranch. But I would not lose hope. However, we still don't know much about back problems. Thank you, Dr. Beebe. One thing I know, Helen. He shouldn't have hired these bad guys. I will not be able to help you. I know, Sheriff. I will do what I can. Good luck, Helen. Welcome, Helen. Hi, Bob. Thanks for letting me know about the accident. I figured Bull wouldn't tell you. I am happy that you are back. I'm taking my brother to see an expert in the east. The best there is. He will never agree to go. He likes that ranch very much. Well, let's see. Helen. Nothing changed. My feelings for you are the same. I have to go, Bob. I want you to know that you can always count on me. I will visit you, Helen. What a beautiful job! I should have said that I didn't like women. Bull. Bull, dear. I feel like a bullock, in this chair. How did you know? Bob warned me. I should have guessed. It was a good excuse to get you back. He says he wants to help us. How do you want to help us during the drought? Does not matter. I came to get you to go to the East. There are good doctors, good specialists there. And the ranch? Your life is more important. The ranch is my life. I will hold on until I take the cattle to the market. This can take months. Where are your employees? Are gone. Before I left under my horse, the thieves were already partying with my cattle. It was too much for them and they abandoned me. Do you think these armed men will take the cattle to the market? It was my best idea. Hire two bands of killers? Those two, yes. The two have been on the warpath for more than twelve years. They will fight and kill to prevent... that others steal, even if it is a miserable horse. They will work hard and obey my orders... before leaving the ranch, for the others. An old saying goes. "Only one thief deceives another". Your knife is sharp. It is occasionally useful. How long have you been with this bunch? Long enough. Since the horse theft at Rancho K? Because? Look at them. They are always watching. We're on a bad path, Hayes. We'd better go. And leave 6,000 heads for Heesman? Are we going to sit around waiting? Sometimes you just have to wait to get rich. There must be more fun ways to kill time. I agree with you, Hayes. Good morning, Miss. I'm Hank Hayes. It will be a pleasure to take orders from you. How about harnessing my horse? Of course, Miss. Faster than lightning. Why don't you let a man do that? Sure. Do you know if there is someone better around here? Hayes! Heesman! I have work for you. I want you to take the cattle to the southern pasture. Of course, we can do that. You will do it together, you and Heesman. Understood? Sure, boss. So, get to work. Sure. As a seal, a horse for your sister. Your horse, Miss. We will. It is better to stay close to home. At least I can still shoot. One of us has to keep an eye on them. Hayes reached the hill. See our shadow. What are our chances? He's following us like a sniffer dog. It does not leave us alone. Look at these bubbles. How long will we sweat like mules? I'm also getting tired of this. Wherever I go, one of Heesman's men is there. Yes. It's been three weeks since Hayes just told us to wait. Makes us work so hard while waiting, that we don't have time to go to the city to have fun. Maybe we can have fun here too. You will end our plan, and Hayes will end you. It is part of my plan now. I would change my mind if I were you, Smokey. Get out of my way. Leave me alone. Get out of the way. Go back and draw your weapon. Do not draw your revolver. You are not dealing with Heesman. I am not so easily mistaken. Turn around! Tex! To set an example for others, who have fun with it. It was nice to you. Get back to work. Tex, go with her. Stay with her. This is your job, now. There are people who reach into the mud and take out gold coins. I would like to have your job. Yes, who knows if Herrick will let me take care of her on the night shift. My brother told me what happened yesterday. You must be waiting, to thank you. It wasn't just for you. I had my own reasons. I cannot say that I feel safer in your company. Accompanying you was your brother's idea, not mine. You don't want me to lose my job, do you? Job! You didn't come for a job. Apparently they are doing well. Exactly, apparently. Like vultures hovering over carrion. Look at them. I must say that I have seen vultures, more beautiful. You are no better. What do you know about me? I know your type. They steal what others have won and they fight, yes, but with weapons. You don't have the life of hard work, of decent people. It? not like my brother, who cleared this land, and buried here the only people he loved. His wife and son. He fought snow, plagues, storms and droughts. And now, you and those murderers and thieves... I think you worry too much. Maybe your brother is smarter than you think. Do you talk about your plan? "Only one thief thieves another". It will not work. It's working. It's working fine. The night is full of love. I will sing my song. Tonight it was made for love. What a thrill to have you so close! When we kiss, I go to heaven. I dreamed so much with tonight. So many times I wanted to tell you, I love you. So many times I wanted to tell you... Listen to them drown their sorrows. Maybe your brother is smarter than you think. That's weird! That's what he said. It is not? Tex. Is it bothering you? Oh no, on the contrary, it has been... What has it been? I almost dare to say that... Say what, Helen? It doesn't seem to be like the others. I do not believe this. You cannot trust them. The night is full of love. I will sing my song. Saddled horses. Tex, come on. Let's go to the city. Come on, women are waiting for us. The night awaits us! I want to have fun all night! Women are waiting for us. Come on! They won't wait for us forever! We will! Come on! They went to the city, the whole pack. I told you Hayes wasn't going to take it. When they return, we will have already made the cattle disappear. Saddle the horses. Wait. Come on! Come on! Bad night to steal, Heesman. Worse for you, Tex. There will be six revolvers against you. And they will be used at once. I shouldn't have tried alone. Alone? We have everyone with him, Heesman. And there are many fences, to fix tomorrow How about you get off the horses and go to bed? Well, is he working or not? Well, well... Look who's here. Good night, Helen. Hi. I have a gift for you. Brought from St. Louis. Thanks. How about, Herrick? To your disappointment, I'm fine. How are things? Different as expected. Bull holds old resentments. It was your cattle that died in the drought four years ago Do you remember? I volunteered to help. What kind of wedding did you want to buy? I just know that I wanted you more than anything in my life. Fight strangely for the things you want. You're right. I made a mistake, in getting you for a price. But I'm still struggling, Helen. Well, now what? Have you agreed to travel? Do not. We know that this plan will not work. Bull no matter what happens to him, I care more for you. I will get men, to take care of the ranch and I will get rid of those gunmen. And your condition? This time, without compromise. I have to talk about this, with Bull. Good night, Bob. I will be waiting. What is so funny? He was remembering Heesman's face. We ruined your plans. I see no reason to laugh, it ruined ours too. We've been standing so long, my back hurts. I would like to go, somewhere. How about you, Tex? Any complaints? Why should? We have our calluses and he the little sister. Holding hands behind the bushes. Enough. Come on, stop. Yes, that is enough. It looks like you and Jeff had something this morning. I have a slight difference of opinion about women. What is your opinion about women? The same as I have about, men There are good and bad. I never thought that a man, like you would fight for something good. A man like me can even kill for something good. Is it too late to thank you for the other day? It may be too soon. We've been here a long time. Smokey, find Heesman. We have to talk. Nobody wants to leave the field free for the other, right? What? Herrick believes, that we can never come together. And what is your idea? We will share. In equal parts. I expected more. Without me, it will be even smaller. How can we do that? I have a buyer named Bradley. Brands don't worry you. We send a hundred heads on each trip. This will take weeks. It? better than trying to take everything at once, and come after us. And the girl? She will notice. I thought about that too. Tex will not let his friend go where he shouldn't. Right, Tex? We can do something. Come on? Done deal. Now you can take them. Bradley has to pay upon delivery. Sure. The others can go back to work. The girl didn't show up this morning. Tex knows how to keep her busy. Too bad you didn't get that job, Hayes. Never let pleasure interfere with business. You could get to convince me, if it weren't how you look at it. Our friend wants to know the answer. Shall we let him help us? It is easy for me to accept your help. Is that you? Are you in love with him? No but... We have always been honest with people. I'll talk to him. It will be better if I speak. I take care of it, alone. Hello, Bell. Too bad you didn't come in time to speak to Helen. Will not you come back? Do not. It looks like we're going to continue the fight without you. I want to hear that from Helen. I don't see the new one here. As I kicked you out of the ranch, I can do it again. Bob! Wait. I owe you that. I appreciate your offer, but... we don't want to continue owing anything. And your obligations to him? Why pretend? You are doomed to that chair for the rest of your life. A man like you doesn't change, right? It never offers help without stipulating conditions. Do you think this time would she feel sorry for her disabled brother and accept? Get out of here. And leave you with a cripple? I kill you. Skirt! Tex! Tex! Take him home. Fast. Slowly. Slow down. Good? The question is not whether they will walk again, Helen. It is whether he will survive. If only I could take you east... You need to recover to make such a trip. You will have more chances if you can get him to rest. I'll be back tomorrow. It doesn't look promising. No. Helen... Helen!... Listen, Bell can help a lot, If you let him take care of the ranch. The ranch is not what he wants. I heard about your brother's accident, miss. Yes, how are you? It's ok. Very well. The doctor said, that he will recover. Call us if you need anything. Thanks. She'll be busy looking after her brother. Let's do this now. Let's do it my way, Heesman, A little at a time. Thanks. Tex Why did you lie about Bull? I didn't want you to change your mind about Bell. I stopped thinking about him a long time ago. It would be a way to get rid of us. You won't need help getting rid of the herd. What will we do when we manage to sell them. Regardless of the price. Are ready. Tell me the truth, Tex. Trust me. Go to the city and don't come back without a buyer, Regardless of the price it offers You can come with me? I've gone too far. How many did you count? Five hundred heads. Bradley would accept the whole herd if we made a good offer. I decide the price. A few more trips and the girl will notice. It's ok. Continue to take care of things here. I'm going to talk to Bradley. Chuck, Take a look. All right, let's go. Understand, Miss Herrick. Delivery is done here at the end of the path. I understand. That's five hundred reses. What about the rest of the herd? I do not know. Perhaps it is better to negotiate with Herrick's sister. What you mean? He's in town today, looking for a buyer. I would pay her, a lot less than I pay you. Can be. The difference is that she will not have cattle to deliver, And I have it. Okay, bring them. I will get the money. Sheriff! The mail has arrived! I will go at the beginning of the week, with enough men to bring the cattle. Thank you, Sheriff. That's what I can do for Bull and for you. See you later, Helen. Bye. Some problem? Does this seem like a problem? I'll take care of that. Tell Heesman, that we will share later. Inside, guys. Tex. You have been ordered to stay with the girl. They went to the city. I know, I saw her. I was trying to sell, the whole herd. For the price she asked, she looked forward to selling. You may have suspected something. Where are you going, Hayes? Forget. It's smart enough to believe, that it can deceive me and live. Hayes Should it happen. Did the girl sell all the cattle? Nothing. We are going out tonight. We will? Tomorrow she will have no ox, here to enter Helen! You need to get back to the city and fast. And you have to leave, the ranch quickly, Jim Wall. How did you find out? I see you still know your name. What advice did you give the two fugitives before killing them? You don't know what you're talking about. Now, listen to me. I've heard you enough. Take your horse and get out. I'll send a warning to the sheriff through the doctor. Take the chance to go then. Why didn't you tell the Sheriff when you saw him? I will tell you why. For the same reason that I'm taking a risk now. Come on, Happy Jack, sing something. That. Come on, sing... It's not bad, for five hundred heads. I keep thinking about how much we will earn from the rest of the herd. A toast for gold. Why work and get rich? I'm lazy, but I'm sane I could be rich, but I don't want to. I do not want. I could be married to a rich woman. And there are more girls around. You know what, Smokey? The bullet that Tex hit you in the ear made you more beautiful. He's a much better friend. Many offers, but did not want it. Now yes. We waste a lot of time fighting between us. Many men died. Yes. It is a pity that they are not here to see our alliance. Too bad our alliance has ended. Heesman, when are you going to learn to never trust me? It's a shame to have wasted all that drink on them. What? Are you going back in the morning? Very early. Okay, go in silence. Bradley will give you the money. You do not come? I will stay here to ensure that no one follows you. I'd better be with you, if the girl tries to seek help. Sparrow and I can take care of her. Get going. You know where to gather. Bring the horses. Saddle another horse. For what? Did you hear me. Here's all the money. Okay, let's go. They took Helen. Saddle the horses! Sure. Slocum, come with me. We will need weapons. Do you bring the money? Yes What is she doing here? It's a little extra, which suits me. Any objection? Stealing cattle is one thing, Hayes, But this is something very different. Herrick may forget the cattle, but he will never forget that. I already said that, but it was useless. We will only bring problems. I feel the same, boss. Tex, you don't say anything. I think bringing it was a great idea. If the Sheriff's men reach us we can use it to guarantee our escape. That's exactly what I thought. We're wasting time. Go back to bed. Heesman! I want my sister back! And live! I'm going to call the Sheriff. I already have enough help. Martin, any sign of them? Do not. So go back to the ranch and bring food, lots of food. I don't know how long this will last, but I will find them. The rest, disperse. Sheriff! Where were you? At Herrick's ranch. That old Doctor rest in peace. Amen. Over there! Well, here it is. I found this paradise years ago, when they chased me... They never managed to find me. Perhaps they were not as anxious as Heesman. Let them come. From here, we can resist an army. From now on, we will guard 24 hours. Jeff, you will be the first. We will camp here on the lake. Tex, you and Brad are going to make a corral for the horses. Happy Jack, make the food. The rest, set up camp. Miss Herrick. We will try to give you the greatest possible comfort. They must be here, somewhere. Yes. But there are many places in the desert... They can hide more than a hundred flocks. Yes, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Let's go eat! Not? You will have to eat at some point. You will have to get used to, with many things around here. Come on! Fast! Are you going to eat all day? I thought we were going to camp here today. There is still an hour to go before dark. Quick, I said! It is a very ugly scar. Yes I hadn't noticed it before. Knife fight? Yeah. It seems recent. It was a year ago. How did you do? You better go to bed. I'm sick of your questions. Where are you going, Hayes? I will drink water. I'm dry as a cork. All right, Tex, you start watching. If you don't feel well, at least you can be covered. Are you sure you won't need it? If I need Be my pleasure to catch them around. Jeff! Help me. Let's make the horses drink. A long time ago I returned to Rio Grande. I lost hope, playing cards in the Sun lounge. There was a struggle, And I used my revolver. And!... I ran away, but I knew that they would catch me. A nest of thieves, it's the only place for me. I'll ride, for myself... even a nest of thieves. I will ride, even a nest of thieves. Hayes! We agreed to leave her alone. Now go! Do what I told you. They camped here a day ago. Come on. The night is as gentle as the breeze. I watch the moon touching the trees. Tonight was made for love. Who knew, that Happy Jack... would have a chance with her? Your turn, Hayes. Do you like it? Very good, Happy Jack. Thanks. We are not that bad guys, You can forgive, our lack of manners. I don't judge you like the others, Happy Jack. Someone who loves, music like you, there must be something good. This is enough. What a thrill to be able to embrace her! And when we saw each other, we went to heaven. I dreamed of this night of love... Happy Jack, take my place in this game. No thanks, I don't want to play poker. So many times I wanted to tell you... I want to love you. So many times I haven't found words... Queens and ten. You must have practiced a lot. I will learn to play like you. The stars in your eyes tell me... that tonight... you will be mine. All of your songs are sad. Because I learned them sad. My grandfather, who died because of a horse and my dad who was killed by the Sheriff's men. Now, I just stayed to sing them. Too bad I have to relieve my guard for Brad. Keep playing. I do not want to bother you. Let's go to the corral. Keep playing. You said it, leave it alone. Wait! Tex arrived just in time. She hugged me and took my revolver. Maybe now you believe, in me. She hates you! Don't forget that, when playing with your charms, that has plenty of them. Yeah. More than a full safe, from Wells Fargo. Make me a coffee, Happy Jack? Of course Tex, whatever you want. So, I'm not going to sleep at midnight. It was foolish. The sentry had seen you. Listen me a horse will be ready at dawn. Take Tex. Hot coffee. Thank you, Happy Jack. This will keep me going. Are you going to sleep all day? Saddle the horses! Aren't we going to eat? We are leaving. How long will we follow behind those old tracks? They are sealed. Helen? Helen? I will not. You can negotiate, for stealing cattle, But now he will answer for murder. Do you think you know everything? Yes I prefer to take a chance. All right. Rise. Get up, everyone. Saddle the horses. It's Heesman! Come on! Bring the horses! I will stay with the girl. Forget it, we have, a shooting ahead. Ah!... Now you have to trust me. I'm going to kill you, Hayes! You shouldn't have come, Heesman! You never had a clue! Load it if you want to get out of it. The bullets are here. Keep them busy. As I said, you never had a clue. I'm going to get out of here. Keep them busy. Now you're alone, Tex! Shoot! Smokey! Happy Jack! Tex! Tex! I only came for one reason, Hayes. Take you. You should get rid of the horses, Rancho K. Smokey was right, you are a disgusting lawman. No, Hayes. This is between you and me. You didn't finish the job after stealing my ranch. When I arrived, my wife was still alive. I didn't touch it! It was the other two! You are lying. You had time to tell me... how you stuck a knife in your shoulder. Tex didn't want to hurt her. And what's the use of killing me? I will not kill you, Hayes. You will come back with me and tell everything that happened. Tex! Happy Jack! We already have it! Take the. Okay, drop your gun. Sure, sure. Come on. Sheriff, I'm not guilty of anything that happened here. I don't want to earn points in the face of the Almighty. I just want a little advantage when the final judgment comes. You were smart to run. We could have hanged an innocent man. And my brother? He's still in a bad mood, as usual. It looks like I made a long trip for nothing. "THE END"
