FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM And welcome back to Good Day Portland. I'm Bink Williams. With me, as always, my delightful co-host... Misty McAllister. And with us in our second hour, Dr. Miranda Faraday, founder of a new breakup boot camp that's taking Portland by storm. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Miranda, you're a psychologist? A Ph.D., yes. Right, and you provide a six-week health and wellness program to heal the recently broken-hearted? Exactly. When you typically get out of a relationship, you want one of two things, to have the relationship not be over, or to be over the relationship, and one of those things we can't control, but the other is well within our power. Well, it sounds like something that could help someone who maybe can't get over lost love. Well, sometimes, people hide their true selves until six months in, when you witness her scream at a waiter, making him cry, but tell us how this all works. Each week has a theme. "Release, Endurance, Teamwork, Connection, Trust, and Closure", and we do a coordinated activity or exercise in keeping with the word of the week. People may feel like broken hearts last forever, but I am here to tell them that it doesn't. Okay, folks, we're going to go to Rick for the weather, and when we return, Dr. Miranda Faraday will tell us more about her program. Miranda? He's going to need your business card, like, right now. Yeah. Well, everyone kept saying how he's this young, financial genius, and they're crediting my reporting for taking down what turned out to be this massive Ponzi scheme. The reason I didn't see you for three weeks. Jen, I'm doing this for us. I'm working really hard to prove myself, and they're finally starting to take notice. That's great, but I need you to take notice of other things. Like what? It's been six months. Where are we going? Right now, we're going to dinner. Ben, we hardly see each other these days. I'm on track to become an editor, and then I get to be the one handing out the assignments, but in the meantime, I kinda gotta write what they tell me to write. And I need someone who is present. I am. I'm right here. Look, let's not focus on the time that we don't spend together, and instead enjoy the time that we do. That's not enough for me, Ben. Something's got to give. Are you asking me to choose between you and my career? I'm saying, the right answer is, "You, Jen. I choose you". I do... and I choose my career. I'm sorry, that's not enough for me. Goodbye, Ben. He went looking for my car ages ago. I have no idea where he is. Think he took it for a joy ride? That would be about right for the night I'm having. I swear, it has nothing to do with the woman who just got in a cab with my heart on the bottom of her shoe. I think they charge an extra cleaning fee for that. Probably. Well, I'm sorry to hear that both your car and your heart are MIA. That's all right, I didn't really like it that much anyways. Thinking about trading it in for a newer model. The car or the heart? I need one of them to get home, so I guess the heart is of less use at the moment. And the girlfriend? Ex-girlfriend, actually, but the bread was great, so I guess that sort of makes up a little for getting dumped. Do you want to talk about it? You've heard the story a thousand times. Boy meets girl. Girl gives boy an unreasonable ultimatum. Girl storms out. Boy eats both entrees. Yeah, we all have one of those. Do tell. Comfort me with your pain. You've heard it a million times. Girl meets boy, girl marries boy. Boy leaves girl, girl takes up kickboxing, pretends bag is boy. I feel bad for the bag. Not so much for the boy. This is me. Hey... Broken hearts do heal. I've seen it happen. Thanks. This letter is your chance to say it all to that person who broke your heart. It's only two minutes, so don't hold back. This is about you now, and you are not the same person who signed up for this program a month and a half ago. You have overcome obstacles, you have stepped outside of yourself. You have changed in ways you never thought possible. Three, two, one... pens down. How are we feeling? Mine has a lot of swears in it. That's perfect. Excellent. So, as closure week comes to a close, you have to decide at our bonfire, do you send your letter, or do you burn it? That's all for today. I'll see you tomorrow. And remember the first rule, no cyberstalking your ex. You know I'm right. Stay off Instagram. Chloe, hi. The phone has been ringing off the hook since the segment on Good Day Portland. And Bink Williams signed up for the program, so that's our best publicity ever. We are at capacity again, so I had to add another session. Good. Maybe soon we can get a dance studio or something, so we don't have to share the space. I know. It's all happening. Are you ready to lead a session yet? You know why this business works? Because I know how to stay in my lane. I handle the business, you handle the clients. Well, it would be pretty easy for you to just, like, toss your blinker on and change lanes. You know this program like the back of your hand. And you are the heart of the business, and I am the head, but I am sorting through resumes, and there are some great candidates. I'll set up interviews this week. You will not be on your own forever, I promise, and then, maybe when the pressure is off, you can take some time for you. I take plenty of time for myself. I'm going to the rock wall tonight for a climb. That's not what I mean. You need to stop moving, and doing, and climbing, and get back out there. What would you say to a client who refused to move on? I'm not refusing to move on. I will get back out there, eventually. I'm just... You know, success is happening for us right now, and I want to ride that wave. Thank you. Hey, Kim. Hi. Mom and Dad okay? Yeah, they're fine. I just need you to talk me out of doing something. My greatest skill. Darren's engaged. I know it's been a year since we broke up, but it still stings. What exactly am I talking you out of? Don't let me call him. Okay. Or email. Yeah, no, don't do that. Or ride my bike by his house. I will literally stand in the street in front of your bike. Look at us. It's like we're some sibling lonely hearts club. Speak for yourself. I'm fine. You just think you're fine, Ben, because that's what you do after a breakup, ever since Serena. Why do you always have to bring her up? That was, like, 10 years ago. Because it broke you, and ever since, you've just been putting a Band-Aid over a bullet hole. Have not. I was almost about to talk to Jen about taking it to the next level. "Almost about to"? Yeah, big step. So, there is this program that helps people get over a breakup, and I want you to come with me. You remember the last one, where they just yelled at you, and told you all the stuff you did wrong? Or the walking on hot coals guy that promised you all this empowerment, and the coals weren't even real? Yeah, I'm still paying that one off. But at least I'm trying. Unlike some people who pretend that they're fine and then probably cry in their cereal every morning. I don't even eat cereal. Look... I just don't want to see you taken advantage of, okay? Give me some credit. I did my research. She has a great reputation, and it's in Campbell Park. You love Campbell Park. Come on, I'm tired of feeling like this, and I don't want to do it alone, and remember? Helping your sister? Your greatest strength? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hate it when my words come back to haunt me. Fine. Thank you. Look at her resume. Advanced psychology degree, was in private practice, and she's a Reiki instructor. I don't know what that means, but it sounds like teaching experience to me. Sounds great, but I mean, qualifications aren't everything. We need to find somebody who gets what we do. I have a good feeling about her. And what I've learned in my practice is it's not one size fits all. You can't treat everyone out of a textbook. I could not agree more. I think that too much talk therapy, instead of real action, can keep people stuck. Exactly. So, I was wondering... how do you feel about incorporating past-life regression into your program? Well, that is... not really what... what we do. But you should. Because we aren't always dealing with trauma from this lifetime. Okay, thanks, Gayle. We will be in touch. Thank you. Namaste. Hi. Hi. I'm Helen. It's my second go-round. I guess it takes more than six weeks to get over a 30-year marriage. Oh, my goodness, Bink Williams! I watch you every morning. I guess no one's immune from heartbreak. I guess not. I'm just gonna... I'm Kim. Hi. Hi. I'm here for moral support. Yes, my brother is completely unaffected by his recent breakup, or any other breakups that may have happened in the past. At least, that's the story we're going with. Well, that's because it's the truth. - Ben. - Hi. We all go at our own pace. It takes as long as it takes. No pressure. Well, we'll remember that. It's work. I'm gonna take this outside. You're gonna want a muffin. Yeah, I'll see you in the morning, Leo. Yeah, bye. You. Of all the boot camps in all the world, right? Do you know of many others? Only the military kind. What are you doing? Just trying to picture you with a buzz cut. And how's that? I think you picked the right boot camp. Well, you don't sound too thrilled about it. Well, my sister wanted to go to this one. I'm here for moral support. That, and she knows all my secrets. I mean, it's got a pretty good reputation, and you can't beat the view, so... Well... yeah, but Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp? Come on, I cannot be the only one that thinks this is a little out there. I mean, maybe this lady thinks she can start some new fad, make a couple bucks, I've seen it before. Everybody likes a quick fix. You have some pretty strong feelings about it. Pretty strong feelings about a lot of things. Like pizza. Want to go grab a slice? Maybe you shouldn't knock it before you try it. I don't know, the whole kumbaya, circle time, chanting with strangers isn't really my thing. Yeah, no, that's not my thing at all either, so. Excellent. Then we're in agreement. So, pizza? Let's just go in, and just... just give it a try. You're not going to save me from this, are you? Is that what you're saying? I think only you can save yourself. Come on. Okay, everybody, give Bink a little space. And the first thing that you're gonna learn here is that we don't date on the rebound, yours or anyone else's. So... Thank you. So you're the teacher. The... breakup boot camper. Miranda Faraday. Ready for a little kumbaya, circle time? ...And by the time we reach week three, "Teamwork", you are going to feel like completely different people, and that'll bring us right into to week four, "Connection". Can I chime in really fast? I'm sorry, is that a thing we're allowed to do here? Yes, this is an open dialogue. What about fear? What about fear? Well, I don't see it on your list. You have all these buzzwords, "Trust, Release, Endurance", but when do we deal with fear? Because that's why we're all here, right? We're afraid to deal with life, without that person that just broke our hearts. Ben... He's right. I'm scared to be on my own, and I can't just move on since I have to see Bethany and her new girlfriend, every other week, because of Ruth. We share custody. It's so hard on the kids, going back and forth. Thankfully, mine are grown now. Ruth is a cat, but she's definitely struggling. See, fear is a powerful motivator for people. Fear is a symptom. Trust, endurance, those are solutions, and here in my boot camp, we choose to focus on the buzzwords that uplift. Yeah, perhaps the person with the Ph.D. can continue with the orientation. Unless, of course, you have a post graduate degree as well? No, no, just asking questions. She said it was allowed. It's okay. We're all just breaking the ice here, but I do think that you should do one thing every day that scares you, but I call that empowerment. What are you afraid of? Heights. Spiders. Dentist... but I'm not going to the dentist every day. No, no, no one is asking you to do that, but when you face those fears, the heights, the spiders, the dentist, you feel like you can overcome anything, including a broken heart, and that is empowerment. Because it's easy to just be negative and cynical and want to tear things down. So, this program, we're gonna focus on the positive, and you will see exactly what I mean in our kickstart session, on Thursday, called "Release". Ben... I'll wait for you outside. Apologize. You didn't tell me who you were. You didn't ask. I just wanted to say that I know it might be weird because you were so vulnerable with me the other night, but there's no shame in having your heart broken. My heart's not broken, it's gently bruised. Bruises heal faster than breaks. Maybe there's an underlying injury you don't know about? Come on, I was there. I saw you. It's not as bad as you're making it out to be. I'm doing great now. I'm processing things. Moving on. In four days? Sometimes, four days is all you need. Okay. I think there's something you want to say, and I think it has to do with the fact that you're famished, and you really want to take me up on that pizza offer right now. Yeah, that's not what I was going to say. I do wonder if this program is the right fit for you? Are you booting me out of boot camp? No, I wouldn't do that, because I can help you, but it only works if you take it seriously, so I think that is something that you need to figure out. You just can't help yourself. You always have to say something. Editor of the Harvard Crimson. You went to an Ivy, and became a know-it-all. Oh, stop. I was a know-it-all way before Harvard. You know what, I'm fine. I can do this on my own. I mean, it's obvious you're never going to deal with your stuff. Or is it that I've already dealt with my stuff, and this is redundant? You don't have to come back on Thursday. Well, you can't say we didn't try. Sure I can. You've reached Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp. Please leave your name and number, and someone will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks. Miranda, hey, Ben Myers here. Listen, I was thinking about what you said, and I think that the program is not for me, but I did want to say thank you, and good luck, and if you change your mind about that pizza... Yeah. Bye. You got a minute? I have some news. Yeah, yeah, sure. Dean Rossi got a job in Austin. He's leaving at the end of the month. So there's an opening for a features editor? The board doesn't know if you're ready, but I'm working on them. You just keep doing what you're doing. Whatever it takes. I appreciate the vote of confidence, Leo, really. Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp. I saw this lady on Good Day Portland. - Are you doing this? - Well, no. I went once, but just to help my sister, I'm not gonna go back. She's always into that self-help, fad stuff. No, Ben... You need to go back. I don't need this, Leo. I'm fine. No, I mean, on assignment. You know more than anyone that once you start digging beneath the surface, sometimes, you strike oil, like with that Ponzi thing. Well, I don't know that this is like the Ponzi thing. Well, maybe not, but is this the real deal, or is it just some fad, full of empty promises? These people are everywhere. Nobody is better than you at finding the story beneath the story. Go back, dig around, and bring me something good, and if it turns out as well as the last piece, well, that editor job is as good as yours. Hey. Ben isn't gonna be coming back, so I'll use the extra bag for demonstration. - Can I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah, what's up? There's a voicemail you need to listen to. Hi, it's Dex. You're probably surprised to hear from me, but I, noticed you liked one of my photos online, which was kind of strange, and I think we should talk. So can you call me? Thanks. You liked one of your ex-husband's photos? No! Not on purpose. You were cyberstalking him? I was curious, I... kind of like when you're watching the nature channel, and you see, like, a snake eating a frog, and you just... keep watching. That is such a weird analogy, and I don't know what is going on with you, but that is exactly what we tell our clients not to do. Dex does not deserve any more of your attention. I know. It was one time, Chloe. Are you gonna call him? No. He clearly thinks that I'm pining over him, and if I call him back, it's just gonna confirm that, so no, I'm not calling him back. Tell me that you are not. Not what? Pining over him. No! I am totally, definitely, categorically not pining over him. I don't need to call him back to prove that. So, yeah, no, I'm not calling him back. And you are deleting that app off your phone. I mean, I'm the first one there in the morning, I'm the last to leave at night, I do every assignment that they give me, and he still has to sell me to the board. You've only been at the magazine for two years. These things take time. But I'm so ready. I'll do whatever it takes to prove I'm up to the task. You'll get there. Just keep doing what you're doing. Yeah. - Jen. - Ben. Hey. It's not what it looks like. We just... went to lunch. Right. You remember Emmett from my office? Yeah. Sure. No hard feelings, right, bro? No. We gotta go to work. Yeah, us too. So at least that wasn't awkward. Well, he seems perfectly terrible. I've met him. He is. You okay? I didn't realize I was that replaceable. Hey... this says way more about her than it does you. Don't self-help me. Come on, you sound like the boot camp instructor. I'll take that as a compliment. She's very smart. Lots of five-star reviews. Come on, we can get over this together. Me and you, and you and me. Us. Team. Power healing. Fine. I'll go back with you, but only because I want to take care of you, all right? I want to make sure you don't get sucked in. Yeah, I don't think that's the only reason. Thank you. Miranda? Hi, refund. I'll have Chloe cut you a check. No, actually... I've been thinking about it, and I'm ready to do the work. That's a pretty big change from before when you called it a fad, and said that I was trying to con vulnerable people out of their hard-earned money. I didn't say that about you specifically... - It was implied. - But not intended. So, what changed? I'm a man who knows his flaws. Do go on. Okay, I ran into my ex-girlfriend, already on a date. That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds like a textbook rebound. Yeah. The guy called me, "Bro", too. Yikes. Extra sorry. Okay, well, are you ready to check your inner cynic at the door? Because tonight we sign the pledge. Of allegiance? Because if not, that sounds a little culty, you know that, right? What am I signing exactly? It's a pledge of commitment, and it's not to me, it's to you. If you think you can commit. I can commit. I've had the same ficus for 10 years, but I never sign anything until I see the fine print. Listen, Ben, I want you to know that I am committed to helping you get over your breakup. And I'm committed to helping you get over yours. That's not how this is gonna work. But is it, though? Okay, how about we just lose all preconceived notions we have about one another, and we start fresh. Deal? Deal. Good. Kick! Welcome to week one, "Release". Punch! Kick! Come on! Atta way. You have anger. You have pain, you have fear. Accept those emotions, and then release them into that bag. Just like that. Kim, do not go easy on that bag. Did what's-his-name go easy on your heart? Darren? No, he did not. Atta girl. Let it out, let it out! What is going on over here? I just, I don't see what good this is doing. I'm a lover, not a fighter. Less talking, more punching. Oh, come on, Ben, a nine-year-old could take you. Do better. You're holding on too tight. I don't want to pretend the bag is Jen. Or someone else from your past? Okay, then, why don't you just give it a hit... bro? Yes! Better. Thank you, Ben, for joining us. Kick! Sorry. You're okay. Let's walk it off. So, Bink Williams hates me. I never thought I'd say that. This does feel good, though, right? Yeah, I guess. - Have a good night. - See ya. - Yo, hey. - How was it? It was about what you'd expect, but I got a good workout, which is a win since you keep me so busy, I had to cancel the gym. So what's the deal? I don't know yet, still sussing it out, but there was one red flag, though. This commitment thing she wants us to sign. Well, make sure you read the fine print. I intend to. Okay, keep digging, Ben. Yeah. Hey... Hey. I just wanted to say that was really good in there. I'm just really feeling it. See, once you stop resisting, it's not so bad. Yeah... and starting with Release Week was super intense. Anybody ever ask for their money back after this point? I was checking out your terms, and you're pretty tough on refunds. Well, I'm only tough on them because... Miranda. Dex. You... you didn't call me back, and I think we should talk. Yeah, we totally should, but tonight is not good for me. I... We have a thing. Right, and we're late for that thing. Yeah. Reservations. Our favorite restaurant. Sushi restaurant. Chef Koji keeps the hand rolls coming. They are... good. And then after, we go to the overlook, and drink some wine, and look out over the city, and plot out our lives. Yup, that's us. Every Thursday night. Super fun. You bet. Right... Okay... So, you'll call me to set up a time? Yeah, totally... Bye. You want to talk about it? No. Invisible teacher-client line, huh? But I am kind of involved now, if you did want to talk about it. I promise I wouldn't tell anybody. That was my ex-husband. I sort of assumed. Well, you know what they say about people who assume... They're very charming. So, are you going to call him? No. Look, I know we don't get to closure until, like, week six, but maybe that's why he was here? I don't need closure. Oh, come on, you tell everybody in your classes to do these things, but you don't believe it yourself? No, that's not what... Look, he doesn't get to just leave without saying a word, and show back up out of... What were you talking about, because that stuff was very specific. I was just... mentioning my favorite place. I know what you're doing. What am I doing? Well, you're turning it back around on me, when the moment was most definitely about you. Yeah, but you made it about you when you started getting super descriptive. It was hypothetical. Was it, though? Yeah. Yeah, it was... I would be happy to do that in real life sometime, if you're game. I have to go prep a class that starts tomorrow, but thank you very much for your help, Ben. Tough love, but then I leave out the love part, because you can't go too easy on your clients, or they never learn. What we're looking for in our new instructor, Simon, is someone who can approach things from a place of kindness. Kindness can be mistaken for weakness, and I'm not weak. There's certainly no question about that. Well, they can't be all good. What's that? 47 five-star reviews. Well, you know people are able to get those things removed when they're particularly scathing. Yeah. Miranda did say one thing that was sort of cryptic the other night. Almost as if she doesn't believe in the things that she's doing, or follow them herself. Sounds like something worth looking into. I have a meeting in the morning, so do you mind covering the feature department meeting till I get there? Yeah, for sure, I can do that. It'll be good practice for you. You know, for the future. Welcome to week two. Endurance. I hated this week last time. And squats. I mean, it's not like I wasn't warned... by Misty, my guy friends... even my mom... but she hates everyone, so I can't really count her. I get it, Bink. My dog hated Darren. That should've been my first sign. Dogs know, Kim. Dogs know. I should have, too. I feel like such an idiot. But there was this undeniable connection, you know? She got me in a way that no one else ever has. And you're good. Somebody else will get you like that again one day, Bink. In relationships, we see what we want to see. This was a lesson you needed to learn on your own, and you did. Okay, jumping jacks, people! This is endurance! Come on, come on, come on! Like a boss, Kim! Good job! I don't understand how this is supposed to help somebody get over a breakup. Challenging yourself at a point where your confidence may be depleted can make you feel powerful. So I went bungee jumping this weekend. I wanted to face my fear, and it was terrifying... but in a good way. She used one of the bad words. Never mind him. Go on, Helen. Well, it was either that, or call Roger, so I opted for diving head first toward the concrete and praying that the ropes hold. Well, I'm glad you chose the safe option. I wanted to feel alive, which I really actually haven't felt since my divorce. And now everything looks different. I feel different. You're really inspiring, Helen. I am? Maybe I'm not so wrong. You should add a fear week. Maybe I should, but I would call it transcendence. Good job! Remember, in this life, you are not alone. You have a support system. We'll get more into it during the Trust and Teamwork week, but lean on each other, here. Your turn. Get across that beam. You're so pushy. Please. Look at that course. All of you made it. Not a single one of you quit. Next time your confidence takes a hit, I want you to remember that, and I want you to relish it. Well done. Helen, how are you feeling? Oh, yeah. Looks like I need to find myself an end-of-the-week ritual, too. And my sister's yoga teacher is selling her studio when she moves at the end of the summer. It could be the place. I mean, if new sign-ups continue like this, it's a definite possibility. So this candidate has two degrees. Early childhood education from NYU and psychology from Carnegie Mellon. Sounds good, but I know somebody with an MBA from Columbia who would be perfect. This is our business, Miranda. It's too risky. Chloe, you've been with me every step of the way, since Dex left. You know this program better than me, probably. I just don't have your... vitality. Please, between the two of us, you are the most... vitalitous. That is not a word. It could be, in Canada. There she is. You? Me? You? You climb here? I climb here. Like, all the time. Funny, I've never seen you. I was thinking about the obstacle course. It was empowering. Didn't want to lose the momentum. Good. Want to race to the top? I'm more of a slow and steady kind of climber. I'm more of a challenge yourself, beat your best time kinda climber. Kind of figured. Always on the move, right? Classes by day, climbing walls by night? It's how I manage my stress, I guess. That's fine, as long as it's not an avoidance tactic. I manage mine by sitting still. You know, your class is a lot more expensive than you think. I've had to go to the chiropractor three times since I started... my back. My class is very affordable. And I'm sorry about your back. What about your heart? Strong and sturdy. Okay. Not ready to talk about your stuff yet. That's fine. We'll work on it. I don't have stuff. I'm getting there. You done already? Okay. You want to switch walls? Yeah, sure. Can I get some water first? Sure. So boot camp? Where did that come from? Necessity is the mother of invention. Necessity for you? You're a Ph.D. You had to be making a nice living. It's never about the money for me. It says on your website that you have 417 healed hearts under your belt. How many unhealed? You know, looking for problems where none exist is a very unhealthy outlook. Or focusing on the negative from time to time is how we improve. Grow. Which I understand is sort of your thing. See, I pay attention in class. Well, sometimes. But not in my boot camp. Look, this is how I healed after a broken heart, so now it's how I help others. So the business was your rebound? What, is this a workout or an interrogation? I'm placing my trust in you, and I just... I kind of want to understand what I should. Because it works. You'll see. Okay. As long as you're not diving into other people's problems so you don't have to deal with your own. Is that what you think, Dr. Freud? Go. You can have a head start this time so it's not so embarrassing for you. Right. Here we go again. Time's up. Okay... That's... as far as I go. - You're doing great. - I know. I'm on to you, you know. You can tell me the truth. This was your first time, wasn't it? You got me. As you can see, I'm not so good at being not so good at things. That's why you need to challenge yourself, so that you're not in your head so much. Well, I'm a chronic over-thinker. It's hard for me to just turn it off. There he is. I was waiting for that guy to get here. What guy? Valet stand Ben. The one who thought he was never going to see me again, so he was completely real. Well, I feel the same way about valet stand Miranda. She just listened. She didn't try to analyze or fix me. But that's exactly what you're paying Boot Camp Miranda to do, so. Not tonight. Tonight, we're just a couple of climbers. One very accomplished climber. One who's just happy he didn't break any bones. The night I met you... I think Serena did me a favor. Did she? Yeah. I was always talking about "maybe almost" taking things to the next level. Jen's problem with me. I could never get past "maybe almost". What? Why are you smirking at me? It's not a smirk. This is exactly where you should be at this point of the program. The letting-go stage. That means it's working. Well, everyone, welcome to week three. Teamwork. After a breakup, we can feel like our trust is shattered and that we're alone, but we're not. We can rely on other people to help us through anything. So, today, we are going to work together... or we are all going to die! There is a bomb in this room that is big enough to destroy the entire city, and we have 60 minutes to dismantle it. Start the clock! The fate of the people rests in our collective hands. Do not let them down. Start. Seriously, come on. There's a bomb! Okay... One, two... five. - Come on. - Four... I'm trying to get this right. It's not right! Don't yell at your partner. Lean on them. Don't make me do math! Okay, switch places. - Okay. - Okay. In relationships, just as in life, if something's not working, we try a different tactic. Ben, how you doing? Pretty good, actually. You want to... you want to press the big red button? Just don't blow up the city. Cool. Secret passage. There's no door knob. - Yikes. - Yeah. There's no door knob. Your teammates have encroached on enemy territory and have been captured. You must rescue them in order to receive your next clue. Hang in there, Miranda, we'll save you! And my brother. Yeah. Sure, whatever. Tell my mother I love her. I'm not a big fan of small spaces. I have never been a big fan of small spaces. Can... Okay... Hey, hey, are you okay? Yeah. I'm-I'm totally not panicking. Except for the part where I'm kind of a little bit panicking. Can you just ask me a question or distract me or something, please? Yeah. Yeah. Favorite ice cream? Vanilla. Come on, that's so boring. What's yours? Chocolate chip cookie dough. Way too complicated. I'm a purist. We're working on it, you guys! Making real good progress here. No, we're not! I know sitting still is not your favorite activity. It's actually right above being trapped in small spaces, so I'm really killing it here. Oh, good. Can you not tell anyone out there about this, please? Because I do need to maintain some sort of street cred with them. I'm not so great at letting my guard down. See, but by telling me that, that's exactly what you're doing. Very astute. Maybe you should be teaching this class. I'm just trying to return the favor. You take care of everybody else. You know... you could let your guard down, too. See, that's one of my least favorite activities... right up there with... failing at pretty much anything, and getting attacked by a shark. Well, the shark thing's normal. And you don't really strike me as the type who fails at much. See, that's the thing, I work really hard to not fail at much. In my business life, at least. And in your relationships? Suppose I could've paid those equal attention. Yeah... same. Everyone's dead. Great! Well, you can't win 'em all, but we worked together, we enjoyed the journey, and that is the lesson. So... smile. Great. Thank you. Get home safe. I'll see you all next week. Hey... I had a question. Shoot. About the letter, at the end, where we burn it or send it or whatever. Are there rules there, or can we change who it's for? I mean, you're getting a little ahead of yourself, that's week six, but you'll be writing it to the person you need to let go of the most. Yeah. That's kind of what I thought. Serena? Kim tell you that? You told me that. At Rock Wall. Freudian slip, maybe, when you said Serena, instead of Jen. You're a really good listener. That's... that's really annoying. It's kind of the job. Why the change? You know... because I was always just toeing the line with Jen, couldn't figure out why I couldn't really commit. Maybe because you never really let go of your one? I'll see you next week. Welcome to week four... Connection. This week is all about getting back in touch with our vulnerability. And this here is a safe space where you can feel that. This was my favorite week last go-around, and I have to say, I was pretty darn good at it. This is Senora Cornejo. She is a world champion on the salsa circuit. She's going to teach us some moves today. We are one short today because Jess is out, so, Bink, I will be your partner. Salsa is not only a dance of love. It's a dance of feeling. So I want you to be in your body, and don't worry about how you look, just feel the music with all of your being. We're going to be doing a very simple dance I created called "La Vida Del Amor", "A Life of Love". Is everybody ready? I'm sorry. This is weird. I cannot be partnered with my brother for this. - Yeah. - Let's switch. I'll dance with you and Ben can dance with Miranda. Thank you. Trust your partner. Do not be afraid to hold onto each other. Dance is an unspoken language. We say so much in silence as we move, together, to the music. And step, two, three, four. And back, two, three, four. Twirl out, twirl in... - Sorry. - Sorry. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. And step, two, three, four. And back, two, three, four. Twirl out, twirl in, and dip. Try that again. Okay. And step, two, three, four. And back, two, three, four. Twirl out, twirl in, and dip. Remember... remember what it's like to feel safe in the arms of another person. You get to have that again. We all do. Ben. Hi. Hey. I know this is sort of outside of your realm, but I need your help with something, and I don't think I'm equipped to handle it alone. What's going on? It's Kim. She wrote her week-six letter early, went to drop it off to Darren today, to show him that she's doing fine without him, and it did not go well. Oh, no. Where is she? I'm meeting her at my place in 10 minutes. Can I text you the address? Yeah. I'll be right there. Weekend in Laguna? Delete. Epcot Center? Never happened. Mom and Dad's 40th wedding anniversary. Hey, don't delete them. We'll photoshop him out. Make George Clooney your date. We have a really good art department at the magazine. Okay, but can Chris Pine be my date? Done. I'm so stupid. I saw his fiancée and I burst into tears. I didn't want to wait. I wanted him to know right now. That I'm doing just fine. But we send those letters or we burn them for us. Not for them. I really thought I was okay. Yeah. Sometimes, it's so much easier just to be angry at someone than it is to forgive them. Why is that? I guess because when somebody's wronged us, we don't want them to get away with it. I mean, how's that fair? Why do they get to be happy? That's exactly how I feel. But all that does is steal our joy, while they're out there, living their lives, none the wiser. So don't let him have that much power over you. Don't let him steal your joy. You're right. And I have a potential new client to meet. So, I am going to go home, clean myself up, and continue being hugely successful in my career. Way better. Thank you. That was pretty great back there. Thanks. Empowerment can kind of be a mirage at first. It feels so good, that you think your work's done, but... really, you're just getting started. It's a process. Kind of like two steps forward, 10 steps back. Well, how many steps does it usually take? Is this, like, a "I need to buy new running shoes" kind of thing or a flip-flop level distance? Everybody's different. How many steps did it take for you? I will let you know when I get there. Bit of a work in progress? Something like that. We started with one class and now we have five that run simultaneously. Miranda covers them all, so you can see why we need a new instructor, especially now that there's interest in expanding outside Portland. But Miranda will go over the nuts and bolts with you when she gets here. And there's our illustrious leader now. Excuse me for a moment. Hey. Dex called again. He won't stop calling. He started talking to me about how we were all such good friends, playing on my sympathies. What did you say? All I could say. That I would relay the message to you. I don't think he's going to let up. What are you going to do? I don't know. Maybe you should hear him out. Once you step out of your comfort zone, it becomes a lot easier. And you say you're not ready to run a class. He's waiting. You did a good job with that staff meeting. You're a natural born leader. You think so? I do. They're coming around upstairs, too. I can be very convincing when I want to be. I appreciate that about you. So how's the boot camp piece coming? Anything I can look at yet? Still kind of piecing it together, compiling notes, research, background, stuff like that. Plus, there's still a couple of weeks left in the program. I have to admit, it's not at all what I thought it was going to be like. You're getting involved, I can tell. Are we going to have to deprogram you? Sometimes, the truth can be ugly, you know? It's not like that. Listen, don't worry about how far along it is. Just get me your notes, whatever they are, just so I can get an idea of how it will best fit in the next issue. And let's talk deadline later today. You think you can get me some photos? Yeah. Nice. In this day and age, where millionaires are made in the self-help aisle of a Barnes & Noble, one has to ask oneself, can you get over a broken heart in six short weeks? Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp in Portland, Oregon seems to think you can. So, should I call her in for a second interview? No. You are not going to let up, are you? You've known me since I was 19. Have I ever let up? Looks like you have a visitor. See you. 'Night, Ben. 'Night. You. Hey. Sorry. I hope this isn't a bad time. I just needed to talk to you. No, I was just heading to Rock Wall. You want a rematch? Would you be up for something different? Maybe go to one of my favorite places, when I've got to shake off the cobwebs? I guess I could be up for something different this one time. When I was just out of college, I used to come up here, look out at the city, and think... I'm going to make it here. It's so beautiful. It's too bad we blew it all up. We'll save the city next time. - I wanted... - Look... Can I say something? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. What do you have to be sorry about? I misjudged you. I called you a cynic, and I didn't give you the benefit of the doubt that I give everyone else who takes my program. But after the escape room the other day... You're a good guy, Ben. Well... You were sort of right about me. Go on. Serena. Jen. Every girlfriend in between. It's like for the last 10 years, I've kept everybody at arm's length. Avoiding. Yeah... you maybe... were a little bit right about me, too. I'm sorry, can you say that again? I just want to make sure I heard that right. Don't ruin it. Boot camp was my rebound. After Dex left, I threw myself into it, and it worked. So, I just... I never really addressed any underlying issues. But your program has helped so many people to let go. And I speak from experience. I'd never be here if you hadn't dragged it out of me. So... what's next? Why don't we just stay here? It's okay to just stop, Miranda. You don't have to do anything right now, except be here. With me. Okay. Welcome to week five. Trust. Ben? So, I was 24 years-old, and I'm shaking, I'm so nervous. And I take the ring box out of my jacket, and I get on one knee, and I open the box, she tells me to get up. Says she can't marry me. Which, I understand, is sort of not how these things are supposed to go. Anyways, within three days, she's packed up, moving to Chicago, with Dave Friedman, her first love. Totally derailed my life. It was bad. I'd never seen him like that before. Or since. Well, the past isn't prologue. You can put your trust in the next person, that they won't let you fall. You ready? Okay. Three. Two. One. Go. Hi, Dex. Yeah, sorry. I've been busy. What time? Yeah. I'll meet you there. I'm glad you agreed to meet. I was starting to think you weren't going to. To be honest, I wasn't, but I think it's finally time for you and I to talk. I agree. And I... I didn't want you to hear this news from anyone else. I'm getting married. In June. I'm sorry if that's hard for you to hear. Actually, I'm... I'm happy for you. Really? You have no idea how much I appreciate you saying that. Yeah. I... You know, I was so mad for so long. I mean, you left without saying anything, but I was dreading this moment, and now I don't... I don't understand why. I mean, I know why I was dreading it. But this... This is not the reaction I thought I was going to get. You're not mad? I wasn't expecting it either, but no, I'm not mad at all. I just see very clearly now that you and I were not right for each other. I'm... I'm kind of speechless. Yeah, it's crazy. I talk about it all the time, that we... we create these scenarios in our head, we build this whole world around it, and... it doesn't... You know, I just... I feel lighter. Yeah. Me too. Congratulations. Hi. Hey, hi. Sorry, they said I could just come back here. Yeah. Yeah, please. Come in. So, what's up? Let me guess. You haven't seen me in 48 hours, you kind of missed me? Smooth. You don't have to say it out loud. I can tell these things. Can you? Interesting, because what I was actually going to say was that I wanted to thank you for your friendship the other night. My friendship? I'm friend zoned. You are my client, and you just got out of a relationship. How's that article coming? Hey. Hi. It's... coming along. I'm working on it right now. I know you. Sorry? I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. My mistake. I need a first draft by tomorrow for the print copy. And we'll send the online version to the web team later? Yup. - I'm working on away. - Good deal. You want to get out of here? Grab a bite? I only have an hour before my next class, but if it's a quick, friendly bite, sure. Excellent. I know just the place. Okay. Street meat? What's wrong with street meat? This guy's an institution. He's been on this corner for decades. No, nothing. It's just not what I was expecting. Come on, don't be a snob. I'm not being a snob. You said you had an hour. I had to do the best I could with what I had. Beef with mustard, please. The usual for me. Thank you. So... don't knock it till you try it. You're one to talk. Okay, I'll admit, I was off to a rocky start, but you can't say that I'm not embracing it. This is so good. Right? No, you have actually been doing very well... and so have I, especially with Dex this morning. You saw Dex? I did. And I... I closed the book. I don't know why I wanted to tell you that, but... after the other night, I just did. This is progress. I could tell you were holding on to something. Did you learn anything in week one? That was... that was release week, by the way. Well, we go at our own pace, and I just took a few years longer than everyone else, so. I would maybe not put that in the brochure. So, later on, do you want to go sit in silence again? See what else that drums up? Sorry. We just agreed to be friends. Did we? I said you are my client, and how you're on the rebound, and I'm kind of on the rebound, so. Yeah, this would be a terrible idea. I won't tell anybody if you won't. I got to go. Oh, come on. Friends? Friends? - Friends. - Friends. Ben! That was a close one. Next time, let me know when she's coming by the office. I didn't know. She just stopped by. Well, anyways... rest assured that extra dedication is not going unnoticed. When I first started at Harvard, I thought I wanted to be pre-med. - Really? - Yeah. Until they took us to an operating suite, and I took one look at the surgery and I fainted. - Stop. - It gets worse. There was a girl in this class that I really wanted to impress, and I fainted on her... and I broke her tibia. That's embarrassing. Yeah, it is. It is. So I shifted my focus to journalism, and I found my calling there pretty quick. - Happy accident. - Yeah. I liked that my words could... educate and inspire... protect. Very happy accident. Kind of like stumbling across this crazy boot camp and meeting this instructor who just will not let you avoid your stuff. Well, sometimes, that instructor comes across a student, who calls her out on her stuff, too. I love my job... and I'm on track for this promotion... and I've been thinking that I never really figured out that whole work/life balance thing. Me either, really... which is awful, because I talk about it in class all the time. I was thinking about something else you said in class. Maybe not all rebounds are bad? Like... maybe they lead you away from the wrong thing, so you can go towards the right one? Exactly. I felt it that first night, and I think you did, too. Maybe rebounds show us how we really feel. And then... he kissed me. Like, he kissed me. Well, you certainly had a day, didn't you? Yes, I did. I am speechless! And you know me, I am never speechless. But it was a mistake. He's a client. I just... I got caught up in the moment. That's a good thing. That is a great thing. I haven't seen you like this in a long time. I really like her. You like him. Why couldn't he have just stayed a random stranger outside of a restaurant? Why did he have to join my class? Kim, I got to tell you something. You were right. I really needed this class. See! You should take my advice more often. I'm very smart. I know. I crossed a line. Whatever you decide, at least you're finally over Dex, and I don't think that would've happened, if it weren't for Ben. My job is to help my clients. Not confuse them. I can't make this about me. I get that, but you get to be happy again, too. Remember that? There you are. What's going on with you, Ben? What are you talking about? I just read your first draft. It's all over the place. There's no point of view. You're straddling the line. I don't understand what this boot camp is all about. Where's the conviction? Like, take a stand. It's just a first draft. Good. Because I don't think you even believe what you're writing here. This is not you. I don't know what to say to him. You're going to have to talk to Ben sometime. I'll see him in class tomorrow. What are you waiting for? Why don't you just kick him out of class and ask him out on a date, already. Or better yet, just wait. The session's almost over. Okay, say we do give it a shot... we'd be doing the exact thing I tell my clients not to do. What's that? Transfer your feelings from one person to the next. Wait, you still have feelings for Dex? No, no, but what if I'm just a band-aid for Ben? And what if a sinkhole opens up and swallows the studio whole? "What ifs" are pointless. No. They are preparation. For a sinkhole? No. You know what I mean. People change their minds all the time. Love is a risk, and you're just going to have to consider... is Ben worth the risk? You sound like someone. What is it? A teacher! Man, I knew... it just sounded so natural. You're good at it. No... On how to handle love, and breakups, and the heart, and all of those things. You could get paid for it! Hey, Miranda, for the bonfire, do we only burn our letters? Because Darren left this sweatshirt at my place, and I'm sick of looking at it, and I'm definitely not going back there to return it. No, you can burn whatever you like. It's anything to help you let go. This ceremony is about you. Thanks. Good to know. Miranda, I'd love to have you back on the show. I could talk about my experience, we could delve a bit deeper than last time. I know you're thinking about expanding locally, but you have the potential to go national. Books, merchandising... Let's get you some real exposure. I would love that. Thank you. Ben... Bink... I think he's coming around. Look, I really need to talk to you about something. After class? Yeah. Street meat for dinner? It's on me. Sounds good. I'll meet you there. Welcome to week six. Closure. You are not the same person who signed up for this class a month and a half ago. You have grown. You have changed. You have overcome obstacles. This letter is your chance to say it all to the person who broke your heart... the person who put you here. It's only two minutes, so don't hold back. This is about you now. Three, two, one... pens down. How are we feeling? This letter is way better than the last one. Good. And tomorrow night at the bonfire, you will make the decision... do you send it... or do you burn it? I'm heading home. Here's some stuff they left at the studio. I don't know whose this is. That's Ben's. I'll give it to him later. Cool. See you tomorrow. Bye. "Fad or phenomenon?" There you are. I got you a chili dog. You left these at the studio. - I can explain. - Can you? Because you've had plenty of opportunities and you never mentioned any article. Look, I... It's not like I wasn't willing to do press, Ben. You could've just asked me for an interview. Miranda... This whole thing has been a lie. Was there even a Jen? Or a Serena? Was Kim in on this? No. Kim didn't know anything about this. Look, I didn't even know I was writing it when I joined the group. But you saw an opportunity to bring me down and you seized it. No. Miranda, everything that I've told you from the beginning has been the truth. Except for the part about writing an expose on my business. It's not what you think. What I think is that maybe journalism wasn't your calling. You should've been an actor, because that was a killer performance. You've really done it this time, haven't you? Come on. Let's open this. Hey. You okay? I'm fine. No, you're not fine. And that's okay, Miranda. Why don't you go home, take the rest of the day off? I can't. It's kickstart day for this class. We're partners. I've got this. Plus, if we're going to buy that yoga studio, I should really work on my teaching skills. Are you sure? I'm sure. Go home. Clear your head. See you at the bonfire tonight. Okay. Look, I know things with Ben didn't go the way you wanted, but it was a big step. You inspire everyone to be better. To believe in their own power. And that's what I'm going to do. We are going to expand this business together. Yeah, we are. We're going to need, like, 10 more instructors, but I'll do for now. I'll see you at the bonfire tonight. Thank you. Hey, Miranda, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. I swear I didn't know about the article, and I'm furious with him. I know you didn't, Kim, and I don't hold any of it against you. Thank you. But I will say this, Miranda... I know he joined the group for the wrong reason, and he can be combative and annoying, but you really did change him. I don't know about that. Hey... ...he's a different person, and it's 100% because of you. I would love to believe that, but... We should go join the group. And while we had three good years together and two not so good years, I set you free. And I set myself free. So, that's everyone. Actually, there is one more. Sometimes, the teacher learns a thing or two. I'm not going to read it out loud, but I will say to this person, thank you for your lessons... and I release you. Now... it's time for the big decision. Do you burn your letters... And this. Right. Or do we send them? Kim? I gave Darren his letter in person, but this will do. Bethany, I wish all the best for you and your new girlfriend. And I am comforted by the fact that Ruth will always love me more than her. The first time around, I burned my letter. But this time... I'm sending it. Roger is getting a piece of my mind. Thatta girl. Bink? One second. I thought he brought that so he'd have something to sit on. Celebrities, you know? This... this was Catherine's favorite chair at my house. I can't look at it without seeing her mean face. Good riddance, Catherine. And stop shouting at waiters. Someone else will get me. Burning the midnight oil, are we? Yeah. You asked for conviction. That's what I'm going to give you. Great. It'll be on your desk in the morning. Can't wait to read it. I've seen army cadets do this course and you are blowing them out of the water. Now keep going! Three weeks in and your class loves you more than any of my classes have loved me. Margaret is turning a color I've never seen before. Yeah, maybe give her a break before the next one, but keep with the inspiring words to the rest. Look what you are accomplishing. After this, a broken heart will feel like a hangnail. Nine missed calls. Yeah, I've got five. It's the office. I hope everything's okay. I'll call them. Hi, it's Chloe. What's going on? No, I don't know anything about it. We didn't give any interview. Is it online? No? Okay. We'll pick one up. Ben's article. Yeah. We live in a cynical world. It's easy to assume that everyone has ulterior motives because negativity sells. Bad news takes the superhighway and good news rides the pony express. So, when I joined Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp, little did I know that, in six short weeks, I would be a completely different man. Each carefully-crafted step of boot camp brought me back to the man I used to be before I had my heart broken by the woman I once thought I'd marry. The man, who once believed in possibility. In goodness. In love. As this article walks you through the steps I took to find my way back to myself, I invite the reader to give this program a shot. Or two. ...because healing is yours for the taking. And Dr. Miranda Faraday has found the step-by-step guide to get you there. You want me to hold down the fort? Yes, please. That's good. Looks good to me. Back again? Do you know where I can find Ben? Upstairs. Executive floor. With the other editors. He got the promotion? He did right by you, threatened to quit if I didn't print his article word for word. But good or bad, all I ask for is the truth. Negativity sells a bit better. Gets more clicks, but... I think this is going to be pretty good for you. 8th floor. Corner office. Lots of windows. Thank you. They'll give the corner office to anyone these days. I liked your article. I'm glad. Sort of wrote it for an audience of one. Yeah, well, my phone has been ringing off the hook. Now I'm in a real situation because of you. Sorry about that. In my defense, not the worst problem to have. It's not so bad. I really am sorry, Miranda. About everything. I know. And if there were only a way for you to make it up to me. My article wasn't enough? It was a very good starting point, but I was thinking something more along the lines of, you know, maybe... being my rebound? I was in the market for one of those and then I met this really smart doctor, and she said those were terrible. She's a work in progress. Aren't we all? And, aside from helping me to get over she who shall remain nameless, your program helped you to find love again, as well, with Ben here, who wrote what I have to say was a fantastic article in Advantage Monthly Magazine about his own experience at your boot camp. She's very good at what she does. Thank you. It was a job, but... once you realize that you can commit to the work, I guess anything's possible. You see, Misty. The sooner one begins the work, the sooner one can get over the guy who pretended to be a pilot and catfished her over the Internet. I know, Bink, and she will. And coming this Fall, Dr. Miranda Faraday's new book, Miranda's Breakup Boot Camp, will be available in all good bookstores and online retailers, so be on the lookout for that. Meanwhile, you can sign up for her classes at her brand-new studio downtown. FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
