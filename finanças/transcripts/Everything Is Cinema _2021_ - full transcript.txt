It is for a documentary. Brother, show this to Modi. No, don't worry. I am Chris and this is my lock-down memoir. There will be many differences between... Louis Malle's 1969 documentary, Calcutta, and this film. Firstly and most importantly, this film is not about Kolkata, even though the city and its people... feature in this movie at various points. Since I watched Calcutta 10 years ago, I have always dreamt of coming to this city, and filming a continuation to whatever... Malle witnessed 50 years ago. His gaze was of a Westerner... and everything he saw was through that Western curiosity. I am no more of an insider than Malle himself was, in this city. I don't speak Bengali or Hindi. The moment you take the camera out to shoot, people become aware of it. My idea was to spend an year in Kolkata... and gather as much footage as I can and edit it all at the end. I was lucky to get a producer who got interested in the concept. So myself and my wife Anita came to Kolkata on... January 3rd, 2020. It was the first time in Kolkata for both of us. As I started looking at the city through my viewfinder, the city started fascinating me more than I ever expected. Anita has been acting in Malayalam movies... and there was a gap between the schedules of two films. So she decided to tag along to take a break from the regular life, and I rented a small apartment in Alipur. She doesn't like the song... with glue! Will impress the girl with missed calls... Stick my photograph to your heart my love, Stick, oh dear... Stick with glue. On your feet. I have been ready for a long time... Impress me, my love. Okay, that was very good. Oh brother, she is carrying. Would a human do this in her condition? Hey guy, the girl did what she could. Now you show us what you can do. Why did you intoxicate my youth? You don't like this song? Hips... When you shake your hips, a lollipop is how you look! When you apply lipstick, it moves the whole district. You look the best in the entire district. Hips... When you shake your hips, a lollipop is how you look! When you wear a nose ring, the cities of Bhabhua and Mohaniya go stirring. Oh you look stunning! You look like butter ice-cream... Hips... When you shake your hips, a lollipop is how you look! Nargees. When you shake your hips... Wont you dance anymore? People are waiting to see. What is bothering your mind? The first three weeks were very peaceful. On January 30th, the first case of corona was reported in India. But I was roaming on the streets of Kolkata.. Till the last week of February. By the beginning of March we decided to stay in confinement... until we get to know what is really happening around us. One good thing that happened to me... due to this lock-down is that, I got back my reading habit. The first book I opened is... Emil Cioran's 'On the Heights of Despair'. At first, I thought of making this film in two parts. One with the camera on her, and the next one on me. But I would know that I am acting. And she is not great with words. And it is known to everyone that, you don't need brains to be an actor. For others, she may be a star. But she is too unreal, plastic. She does not understand that... nobody else would examine her this closely. She would appear in front of the camera only with her make-up on. Too shallow. Look at the kind of roles she chooses! So I decided to film her discreetly. Seems like it is the time of her periods again. I hate periods, I fuckin' hate it! It is not for the reasons you might assume. If you think that it is because she doesn't cook for me during this time, I don't want her to cook for me at all. I can survive with a microwave and a freezer. Shoot of my dream project got canceled... after I had shot for almost two months. Fucking producers. They asked me to wait for three months for more funds. I tried pleading and even threatening them, but they wont concede. This is why I believe that there should be more micro budget films. Now that I have a camera and a subject to film, let me free myself and cinema from the hands of capitalism. Can we go out for a drive? I don't think it is safe. Let us talk. If you stay inside the car and keep the glasses up, we will be safe. It is not safe. If we go, we may have to stop at least to pee. So we are not going? Let's go in the evening. Then I can shoot a couple of videos too. What video? Like you don't know! Don't shoot anything today. Spend some time with me. Give me some time. We are together only! Yeah, right! You will always be with your camera. It happens all the time, and I will be left out. I wanted to get out as I have been staying inside for so long. Do I have to spend time alone there too? You think I don't have any frustrations? Why can't it be about me as well? At least, sometimes. It is always about you. I just want to be able to do what I like doing too. Chris, I just asked you to spend some time with me. And this is how you respond. Wonderful! You always say that you want to be a part of what I do. Then carry the tripod... Or help me with changing lenses... Forget it. You can go with your camera. A virus is an organism at the edge of life. They say that it is information covered in fat. Once it enters your body, it passes down the information that is unnecessary for your body. Or in other words, unnecessary information can hurt you. I have always tended to look away... when something that I don't like occur. That is my defense mechanism. That is how I grew up. Now, they say that the virus is everywhere. And I am stuck in this rented apartment with her... for over a week now. A complete lock-down is not in place yet, but... it is safer to self quarantine. Imagine living with someone who shares almost nothing with you. You have to give some sort of meaning to that relationship, right? You remember that shot from Kieslowski's Camera Buff? As the main character's wife walks out, he brings up his fingers looking for a frame to shoot that. I am that guy. And here is another privileged upper middle class pseudo-feminist lying down with her... 'I am here to impress myself and nobody else' attitude. Bullshit. First of all, these unscientific methods are not going to help her skin. She adds vitamin A pills to eggs everyday and applies it on her hair. That is blasphemy. She eats only fruits and chicken. If I cook rice, she wouldn't touch it. Not because she doesn't like it but since she is on a diet. I know what you are thinking right now. Let her eat what she wants to eat. But have you tried living with someone... who wants to share a lifestyle with you? And do everything according to her wish? Anyway. Even if we assume that all this insanity is going to help her get a... fairer skin and a slimmer body, she is confirming to the mainstream standards of beauty, which is obviously constructed for the male gaze. You think that is feminism? Trust me, I am a better feminist than that. She loves the attention from randoms. That explains why she became an actress and not a filmmaker. A filmmaker always tries to resonate... with the people who can understand him. But an actress just wants someone to care for her. Anyone. That is a hell of a lot of daddy issues right there. These guys who see her only for her skin complexion... or the voice in which she sings, they just want to fuck her. I have a theory. Everything we do in the public domain... is to attract potential sexual partners. Everything we do, creating an art work, making a film, writing a poem, singing a song, playing an instrument or even... talking sweetly is an advertisement for our sexual organs. There is only one difference. Either you care who you fuck or you don't. She loves to sign autographs and pose for photos with randoms. She says that it is all part of the inevitable marketing. Not only a different country, even if one comes from a different state, he has to be quarantined for fourteen days, as per the government order. If he goes out, the cops will throw him in jail. And that would affect his prospects of getting a VISA to study abroad. You can scare him by saying that. Mom, it is pointless to take him for screening. They would check only his temperature. You can't know if he is infected. It would take up to ten days to develop symptoms. That is to see if he already has got a fever. If he takes a Panadol, the fever wouldn't show. You can expect him to do something like that too. What cough? Coughing must be from his habit of smoking. There'd be headache and all. Ask him to stay home no matter what! Even if he has got something, there is nothing else to do. Ask him to stay in isolation. That's just pathetic. Mom, what are you trying to say? That all the other kids are bad and yours alone is a saint!? He would be the one to spoil other children too. I will try. He is not someone who listens to me. But I shall try. I cannot assure you that I can put some sense into him. Maid is not coming. I am managing by myself. Yeah. I cook whatever I know. No thanks. I am happy with whatever I know. I am already doing enough. It has been more than a week since I got out. Ask mom to make him do some dishes, cleaning and some cooking. Also ask him to wash the clothes of Pappa, Mamma, you and himself... and put them out to dry. You need not do all the work alone. Let him learn some household jobs too. Now if he is shy to do women's jobs, ask him to plough the land and plant some vegetables. My dream project is delayed indefinitely. And the entire world is shut down. And all they have to discuss is about her little brother. That little piece of shit is so useless that... he once borrowed my car and ran over a pedestrian. Who told these blunders? It is not that only people over sixty-five get infected, it can be fatal for people over sixty five. That doesn't mean that youngsters are safe. And since you smoke and all, you are susceptible. It's not a matter of your health alone. There is something called social responsibility. What is the use of studying at a big university! Stay at home. Even if they say something, ignore that! I told Mom too. Screening wouldn't tell us anything. Stay in for at least ten days, if not fourteen. No. You had that accident too! So don't drive for a while. She is staying home. You can also stay. I have Prime, Netflix... Chris has also got MUBI and some other services. I will get the passwords for you. I have wasted more money and time on him than... I have ever on my own family. Anita used to say that I don't understand things... because I am a single child. You don't need to be single child to run away from exploiters. Come on. That reminds me of the times when we used to properly sit and talk. For years now we have managed to avoid each other's company. She has been traveling from one shoot to another. And I have been either planning a shoot or... staying home for most of the time. I used to love solitude before I met Anita. When we fell in love, like every other couple... we could not stay apart even for a minute. Later that minute became a necessity and as time passed, that minute became a day and... not long before it evolved into weeks. If it was not for this situation... neither of us would have spent all these days... in an apartment together. Anyway, it's not all that bad. Now at least I get to make this movie. She can't survive without the company of random stupid people. It has been only two months and... she has already made friends with this... Mallu woman who lives downstairs. Now she has donned the role of her relationship counselor. As if she knows how to manage her relationship herself! Wouldn't even bring the tea cup he used, to the kitchen. One day, James came back from work early and starved until I came back from work... saying there was no one to serve him. If it's so difficult, let him starve. It is not our necessity to feed them! I wouldn't blame James though. It's all because of how he was brought up. If we go to his house for vacation! That's how it works with privilege. Those who have got it wouldn't part with it. He has changed a bit now. But cooking and bringing the children up are still my responsibility. Please drink your tea. Is your hair naturally curly or have you done something to it? Everybody asks me that. It has always been like this. When I was at LSR (a prestigious college), straightening the hair became a fashion. I also straightened my hair then. That was the trend back then! I had it straightened for almost fifteen years. But, I felt really sad after that. Because straightening can ruin its volume and texture forever. I always wonder why these girls do this to themselves! My sister also used to bleach her hair for a while. This bitch and many other bitches come to visit her... at the most unexpected and at the least preferred times. It is funny. They all look and sound the same to me. If it was not for the corona, they wouldn't have stopped admiring each other with their fingers. Yeah, I do know that all females are lesbians. Surabhi also told me. You are so lucky. Chris supports you with everything. Even if there are some fights, you are loved. Yeah. He is a bit tender these days. James doesn't like me even wearing a good sari. He wants to have the final say in everything. Chris is not like that. He wouldn't tell anything then and there, but would bring up everything when we disagree on something else. He would even accuse that I dressed up to show off to someone else. I see. I thought... Oh! They are men. They are all the same. How does she know for sure that this bitch hasn't got corona? While we were in Kerala too she used to get visitors almost every day. These women tend to find each other no matter where they go. And it is official, a complete lockdown is in place from today in Kolakata. And I am stuck with her for who knows how long! Mummy, sometimes Chris is like that, you know! I don't know about that. He tells me that he loves his brother. That's true. Once Johny's father-in-law rang him asking for some favor. He avoided him, saying that he was too busy. What! Wasn't that before his shoot began! He would help the people he likes. Otherwise he would act like they don't exist. She is talking to my mother. See how she manages her relationship issues? By bitching about me to my mother. As if she knows about me so well. My entire life got fucked over by these two women. And now they are forming a league. Somebody told her that she can increase... her vital capacity if she does yoga. If you have good lungs, corona cannot... do much to you apparently. She is someone who claims to be... extremely scientific about things. But at the same time she believes that... coconut water can cure cancer, sandalwood can lighten your skin complexion, etc. A rare combination of pseudo science and... unnecessary Wikipedia knowledge she is. I have tried my best to educate her... put some real sense into her. But all efforts have been for not. You deserve this black screen for... successfully bearing her face for this long. It seems like it is not getting any better outside... even during the second week of April. Today morning I got an email from my producer that... he cannot go on with the Kolkata project any longer. It is impossible to find a new producer at this stage. I should have doubted this when he hesitated to sign the contract itself. So whatever I shot outside are pretty much useless. That's when I thought, why not use them here? Could give you a break from the monotonous interiors too. I used to crave for the interiors. I would have shot these rooms and windows... in a much different way, if it was three months ago. Her constant presence makes these rooms... look smaller than they used to be. What virus changed the most is how we perceive the world. The most interesting aspect of Malle's documentary was... the people staring back at the camera. He assigns it certain exotic value... of the unknown culture. But for me it is just a reminder of my existence... right in the middle of this crowd. The only apparent difference I possess from them is my camera. Even then some natives tend to come to me asking for directions. No matter how hard she tries, Anita cannot enjoy this kind of stuff. Maybe it is not her fault she is wired that way. When we started dating, she told me that she loves filmmaking. And we used to watch movies together. We started drifting apart not when we stopped having sex, but when we stopped watching movies together. I congratulate myself for never having a baby with her. I have mentioned earlier about... how she enjoys the attention of the camera. She gets hundreds of messages every day... complimenting her looks. And she sends a heart to every single one of those texts. Superficiality is what she thrives on. She is reading Paulo Coelho, and they call her the intellectual one. She even used to go to colleges to empower women and all. Before we left Kerala, she went to some seminar... organized by some intellectuals about the importance of... scientific knowledge over religious faith. These idiots would go all ecstatic... when a pretty face with boobs talk about... how the universe is conspiring for your dreams and all. Tell me about the height of hypocrisy in everyday life. She is one of those morons who think that... her irrational superstitions can help... the world survive a virus outbreak. I dare her to walk out unprotected and let her God save her. We once went to Ooty together. While we were in the gardens clicking photos... it fell out of her mouth by accident... how she used to enjoy cooking for her ex. Trust me, I am not the possessive, jealous guy I once used to be. But back then, it hurt me. And I know that she intended to hurt me because... I asked her to stop the elaborate cooking... that she used to do every night. The kitchen would look like a war field after 8 pm every night. I was only trying to help her by asking to stop it. It doesn't matter what we actually talk about. Every conversation attempted these days lead to this. So? See, I know that you are getting suffocated here, but I am used to this kind of lifestyle. That's why I don't try to comfort you. I was just asking about the potato bread. It is good. Really? I have told you that your cooking is really good. See, it was all that I wanted to hear from you. When you talk to me without being arrogant, that's all I need! You wouldn't miss even one chance to blame me! I was appreciating you, man! You'd manage to ruin everything good. That's what you have specialized in. Fuck off. What did you say? Fuck you? What? Are you trying to scare me? Piece of shit. It was Anita herself who told me while we were dating that... every husband and wife thinks about killing their partner... at least once in their marriage. I still haven't had murder thoughts but... I would have preferred a nice quiet night, eating my take away while I don't have to do... deep analysis on how to compliment the meal. What is the bloody use of her praying to some imaginary guy... if she is going to behave like this with me all the time? Every time we talk, it turns out to be another mental game. We do a bit too much so we can use that against the other in the future. Anita used to win prizes at school for... story writing competitions, I have heard. But I have never seen her writing anything since we got together. I have asked her several times why she doesn't write anymore. She never gave me a proper answer. Maybe it is me who stopped her, or maybe it is her laziness. Maybe she does not feel that void anymore... after I have filled them, like she told me a few years ago. Oh yes! I do remember what she said from the day one, if they are compliments. You would think that I am manipulating footages. But you must understand that all I am doing is... to collect footages of her daily routine and... juxtapose them in the order of my thoughts. Cinema is about juxtaposing instances of life and trying to make some sense out of it. What's going on? I am making a cake. It's Vrinda's birthday today. So I thought of baking a cake for her. Are you really dumb or are you acting dumb? I don't understand. I am just making a cake for her. She is my friend. It is her birthday. It is lockdown! Yeah... So she can't go out to buy a cake! That's why I decided to bake one. Why are we risking our lives? I am not gonna meet her. I will just leave this at her doorstep and come back. That's not the issue. We are living with minimal resources here. You can't waste stuff like this. Chris, I have used only three eggs. What's wrong with you? We went for shopping together last week. We bought only what is necessary for our survival, that too until the fifteenth. And you are just throwing it all away to show off! Chris, I am the one who cooks here. I use only very minimal resources. Oh, are you? What about all those times when I cooked for myself? Are you trying to imply in between that I never cook here? But mostly I am cooking. I made pickles... I blanched vegetables, kept them in the freezer. I have done a lot of work. Yeah so? That doesn't give you the right to waste things, right? Chris, If Vrinda makes a biriyani or pasta, doesn't she share that with us? But the situations have changed. It is her birthday today! You haven't got the seriousness of the situation! I took only some wheat flour, butter and three eggs! I took only three. There are enough eggs for you till the fifteenth. I don't want any. Is that okay? I can survive on paneer, I will eat something. I don't want eggs. So you would rather starve for your friend. You are trying to make me feel guilty for three fucking eggs? Just going to put this bloody cake at her doorstep and I am going to walk away. I am not going to touch her. She is not going to touch me. After I come here, I will call her up and say, 'Surprise! Just open it up.' Why are you such a paranoid asshole?! What are you trying to prove to me Anita? So the intensity of this situation hasn't gotten registered into that stupid head of yours! I am not an idiot, Chris. I am not getting out. Then why are you acting like one? This makes me happy. All my fucking shoots got canceled. I have endorsements, nothing is happening. I am stuck here, and I am someone with some creative energy. Baking makes me happy. This is how you create? Baking is creative. It makes me happy. Some silly recipe you saw on Youtube! Not from Youtube. My mother taught me this recipe. I used to do this as a child. It is nostalgic for me. Why are you making me explain so much for three fucking eggs? Not that I spent all your money. I too earn. I have supported you for months. I too have supported you for ages! When was that? How did you survive before you had a career? You were just a student. So what? I made it! By acting in my movie. That was my first movie. But I don't act in your movies anymore. Yeah, because I don't cast you anymore. Right! You think it was easy to stand your majesty's dictatorship! Why don't you learn from James? He provides for so many homeless everyday. Maybe that's why she is sleeping around while he is away for business. Chris, she doesn't cross the line! Even if she does, it is her fucking business. What's wrong with you? Why are you so paranoid? Why do you insist on having such shitty friends and keeping some so close? I am not asking you to be an altruist. I am just saying that give a bit. What is wrong with you? I am trying my best. I just wanted to be happy. I am stranded here. I don't have anything else to do. Vrinda is a nice girl. Of course, Vrinda is a better person. If I were not straight, I would have married her. Please do me a favor. When you go down with the cake... please stay there. Please don't come back. Who are you to tell me that? Because this is a house that my producer gave me. You think I cannot afford a rented apartment? I can also do the same. What about all the fucking shit you wear? Who bought them for you? When I met you, you were wrapped in rags! I taught you some sense. That was much better. I taught you some sense. I got you so many things. What sense? The sense of the upper class? Why am I even explaining to you? Who sanitized the place she sat? I don't want to explain anything to you. I didn't ask you to sanitize it. You are a fucking moron. A paranoid asshole. That is not my problem. Now keep away from my fucking cake and go and kill yourself, you moron! The politically correct idiot that I was! I used to think that it was the conformist in her... who was always thinking about cooking and feeding randoms. Her friends alone have eaten at least a few life's worth of food. She lives in some utopia where she gets all the nice things in life. That too at the very moment she wants them. I grew up in a family of farmers. It is in my genes to live with what I have got. I don't know what kind of parenting technique her parents employed, but... whatever they are, they weren't much of a success. I don't understand how she can forget the hard times we live in. Even the meaning of hard times is different for her. She is incapable of making use of the opportunities... that these times have provided us with. I know that it is insensitive to be too optimistic at this point. But we have to go on. Art has to go on. You have two choices. You can either worry about your future... and plant every bloody seed you can find in the kitchen... and try to grow them in your balcony. Or you can try to create something meaningful. In Kerala, actors are usually addressed as artists. Yeah, right. You might wonder why I am making this film. They have never seen the real person beneath the two inch thick foundation. I am doing her and the world a favor. Let the truth speak for itself. Maybe the fate of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden is waiting me too, but hey... True heroes are always recognized only after their death. I met her for the first time during the preview of one of my films. She was a student back then. Later she acted in one of my movies and now she has a very busy career... even though the money is not that great. You know how actresses are treated in our movie industry. Sometimes I feel that she wouldn't have minded doing some compromises... if she was not with me. I feel for people in marriages. If they have even a bit of individuality left in them, how can they stand another person forcing them... to live in certain way every day of their lives! Maybe she too feels the same. Maybe she is someone with entirely different set of morals and priorities. That brings me back to the question of... why we got together in the first place. Was it merely her looks? No... I have met prettier girls. Or was it because I was desperate? Again, I am a filmmaker. And it is not difficult for a filmmaker, no matter who he is, to get laid. At that point our hormones made us feel something lyrical, something magical, something we both wished never ended. But as a matter of fact, like everything would, it also ended. From two people who didn't stand each other's absence, we also turned into two people who cannot stand each other's presence anymore. I remember something from those days. I once gifted her 'The Poetics of Space' by Gaston Bachelard. Years later, when I visited her family once, I found the same book on her sister's shelf. What is even funnier is that Anita hadn't read even a single page of that book. Doesn't matter now. What is more important now, I think is, if we manage to come out of this situation, is there a hope for a better future? What's your bloody issue, man!? Why can't you close it slowly? Why do you disturb my sleep every single night? I am so sick of you. You better sleep before me from now on. Or you sleep outside. Do you understand? Yeah... One night I decided to sleep outside after she talked to me like this. Around 2 o'clock at night... she came there asking why I abandoned her... and won't love her anymore. We have been doing almost everything that... a married couple is not supposed to do. We fight, we swear at each other, we even feel sometimes that the other person might kill us. I have never fallen into a depression like I used to, after meeting her. She too shares this opinion, I think. She said on my birthday that there has never been a dull moment. If I have succeeded in entertaining one person with my life itself, that is not a bad life at all. But is that enough to live on? I am not sure. What if we could spend all this energy in a better way? What if we could truly act like a team? Or are we too different even physiologically that... the two of us were never meant to be together? I don't know. What if there is no light at all? What if there is only the tunnel? Can someone be content with that? Isn't peace a bit too overrated? I don't know. You know that we haven't had sex in six months right? When the initial passion of a marriage wears out, that is natural. No, it is not. Just think that we have better priorities now. I cannot be in a relationship when... my partner thinks that I am not his priority. What are you... a three-year-old? So, when you are in the mood... I am supposed to come to the mood too? But when I have the need, you will make me beg for it? Nobody is forcing you to have sex with me... when you are not in the mood, and look at yourself! Why do you make me beg even for sex? I am not making you do anything. I just don't have the mood. Do one thing, get out. I will watch some porn and masturbate. Come, sit down. What? As partners I believe that... we should never hide anything from each other. That's alright. I would expect that from you too. What are you talking about? Everything. You think I am hiding something from you? No, I want to ask you something. What? Did you really do what you said you were going to do? You mean the masturbation? Yeah. Yeah... What else did you expect? Who were you thinking about while masturbating? It is none of your business. It is my business. I don't think so. Yes, it is. It really doesn't matter Chris. It wasn't you if that is what you are so curious about. Who then? You were masturbating to your ex? Chris, stop it. Who else? That asshole childhood buddy of yours? May be it is him! Who are you... You cannot provoke someone to a point... where they have no other option... but to defend themselves and then call them an abuser. Every relationship is a power game... and the tactics are valid only when you are inside the game. Now the game is over. It was silly of her to walk out. I am just another man with a thousand shortcomings. And everything I say would be biased. While objectifying is one of its characteristics, camera has the tendency to connect you with the subject of the film. And I haven't refrained myself from using her close-ups. When you have nothing new to do, you start collecting things from the past. As Bergson said, matter is composed of images. Since I lost my religious faith when I was 15, I have been in search for an alternative. And cinema found me. A camera and a computer is all that I need to keep living. If you look hard enough, you can always find subjects around you. At least in your memories. If you ask whether there is any hope left, that question itself is meaningless. These shots get their attribute of... waiting for something from their mere existence. But whether you are in a state of having a partner or not, the quality of life remains unchanged. After she left, I finished that book that I was reading. It was as if someone wrote that book just for me. Life is death's prisoner. Like how a movie is always trapped between... two blank screens. In my eyes, this whole situation is a mere reminder of that. When the tomb of Majnun was once visited by the spirit of Layla... She carried with her, a few withered flowers of her desires. From the grave came a voice, as she was about to place them... You may offer them all, my Beloved, but slowly... slowly... The veil slides from her face, slowly... slowly... The moon comes out, slowly... slowly... The veil slides from her face, slowly... slowly... As she entered adolescence, she started to shy away from me... As she entered adolescence, she started to shy away from me... Modesty came to her very soon, but youth came slowly... slowly... I am awake since the night of separation, Oh Angels! Let me sleep now. I am awake since the night of separation, Oh Angels! Let me sleep now. You may take account of my deeds some other time, but slowly... slowly... They slit the throat mercilessly, and I tell the kinsmen... They slit the throat mercilessly, and I tell the kinsmen... Your honor, slowly... slowly... My Lord, slowly... slowly... The veil slides from her face, slowly... slowly...
