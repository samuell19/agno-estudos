[MUSIC] NARRATOR: This is a tale of the limitless sea and of the limitless courage of man, challenging the secrets the oceans have guarded from the beginning of time. 7/10 of the globe lie beneath water, the last frontier of the unknown. According to science, someday man breathing the air that he takes down with him will explore the bottom of the sea. Our stage is the Red Sea, that ancient narrow water separating Egypt from Arabia. [INAUDIBLE] our underwater explorers, scientists, willing to endure the merciless tropical heat above the surface, eager to gamble their lives below the surface for one objective: to bring to the world for the first time motion pictures of life and sounds from the bottom of the sea. Port Sudan, maritime time capital of the Red Sea, is the base of operations. Here shade is at a premium, and merchant and artisan alike work in the open. Abdullah, seller of wheat and his neighbors, who still practice polygamy. Ali, the weaver. Many races and cultures live together in picturesque medley. All have a joyous and childlike attitude of life, gossiping today of the strangers newly come. The man who leads them, so the chatter runs, is a bearded magician. He is as one touched by Satan, for men say he walks on the bottom of the sea. All eyes are focused on him, for he brings gold to spend, has come to charter a ship. The city has this one excellent outdoor cafe. Lotte, secretary to the expedition, has news for her boss, Dr. Hans Hass. Eric, our still photographer, is too ill to join us. He's still down with a fever. Please doctor, can't I take his place? I'm not afraid. The doctor has asked for a second ice cream. The last was melted. Ice cream, not soup this time please. Yes sir. Yes sir. Nice, firm ice cream. I can operate a camera and swim underwater, both well she pleads. Now, my dear, you know that's out of question. Abdul, the ship owner, and Mahmoud, the happy go between, rehearse their familiar act, the gentle bargaining with strangers who have gold. Mahmoud collects his commission first. Mahmoud delivers his client to the ship owner. Lotte, intuitively sure of herself, goes on her way with Hassan the cook. Arabian women, as all know, are always completely covered. Imagine a young woman wearing trousers in public and walking at the side of a servant. 15 minutes have passed and the doctor still is bargaining. Dr. Hass likes oranges. The way to a man's heart, so they say, is through the things he likes. 2,000, ridiculous! 1,200, no more. Lotte learned her bargaining in the hard school of Viennese marketing. She knows a bad egg. Dates? No. The doctor prefers oranges. And still, no deal. Lotte heads for home. Hassan runs interference. OK, OK. 1600. Mahmoud had urged 2,000, hoped for 1,800, is delighted with 1,600. Mahmoud leads his patron home via the old slave quarters. He has much to say. Effendi, I know you saw me take money from Abdul. This is a custom. Be not angered. Do not destroy my hopes. Let Mahmoud go with you. Obedient but so greedy. Master, I am but a poor man, dependent upon the generosity of great lords such as yourself. My children are many. My father is old and his needs multiply. And I approach the time of life when it is fitting I take a third wife. Ay, life is hard. Expedition headquarters, Port Sudan's finest house. Dr. Hass is still worried. What a time for a key man to get sick. Can he depend on his secretary, a mere woman, for camera work for this dangerous business? It seems that Lotte has decided for herself. Already she's up to her neck in film. She knows what she's about. Eddie, sound technician, sets up his equipment. They propose to record underwater sounds, the answer to the question, do fish have a language? Assistants are Leo and Jerry. Both are past masters of the fish spear and photographic helpers. Xenophon, Greek fisherman, master seaman, navigator. The house man, Marab, he got his job through his cousin Mahmoud who just won't get lost. In the ritual of Allah, he washes his feet up the doorstep of his master. This home now is his home. He has adopted the doctor. With the dawn, they tackle their job. [ENGINE STARTING] Mahmoud plays captain. Fear not, Effendi. There be no devils in these shallow waters, Allah be praised. But I, Mahmoud, nevertheless am here to guard you. Lotte is well trained in the new art of flipper swimming. She finds reward in the fairyland vistas of the coral reefs, understands now the lure of this fantastic wonderland. The water is bathtub hot, heavily salt, strongly buoyant. Lotte's delight is collecting rare shellfish, and down here are multitudes. She finds many still unnamed in the books of science. The chance to study fish in their habits exhilarates Leo and Jerry, and at last they are entering this paradise of the fish world, this underwater Garden of Eden. Conventional strokes of surface swimming have no place in underwater work. The boys are evolving techniques based on the pollywog's way of swimming. The fish, completely unafraid. In fact, friendly. A specimen. This may be another entry for the books of science. But shells are rough, and her fingers pay the price. On this first dive the alert leader plays the part of lifeguard, although there's little danger in these tranquil, in shore waters. 15 years of underwater exploration, however, have taught Hass the wisdom of being cautious. Lotte goes upstairs, up to that luminous ceiling marking the frontier of that other world above. Xenophon, veteran fisherman that he is, accepts the specimen with indulgent interest. To him a shell is a shell. Why anyone should be excited over an offbeat oyster? This he doesn't understand. The program now calls for exploration of the coast. Hass wants to spy out the reefs, see for himself the lonely coral islands once used by pirates for stronghold. Today, only the birds survive. Where long ago escaped slaves hid out there are now only wild thicket, a turn a pair of turn, a white heron and a [INAUDIBLE], a nest, blue heron. For Mahmoud, here's a happy hunting ground. Birds' eggs delight him. All Sudanese dote on them. For Xenophon also here is delight. The world's finest langusta, the lobster of the Red Sea. Half an hour later, an eipcure's picnic. Hot, tender crawfish, and for the Sudanese, gamy eggs, two weeks old. Freshly laid, ugh. No good. Rich, ripe, and odorous. Ah, wonderful. Visitors. Pyramid crabs, so familiar on the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt. The crabs burrow for food as the tide recedes. But why they pile the sand so neatly into pyramids is as much a puzzle to science today as it was to the Egyptians of old. Tradition says that the architects of the pharaohs worked out the design of the Great Pyramids by observing these little workers. Long since, the tides of time washed away the glory that was Egypt. Yet still today, nature's builders construct their pyramids, the riddle of the Red Sea sands. On the way home Mahmoud gives his version of the pyramid puzzle. The crabs be but the tortured spirits of men who worked too hard in life, now doomed by Allah to work forever. Research demands much of the doctor's time with the microscope. With Eddie he classifies the coral taken from the reefs. In infinite variety, coral grows like plants. These crumble. Their debris builds up the ocean floor. Others resemble intricately veined leaves, brilliant in every color of the spectrum. Brain coral is like granite. The lovely ruffled coral also is hard, but brittle. The amazing exception is the poison polyp trap, which paralyzes and devours small fish. All except one, the striped polyp fish. He is immune to the poison and makes the polyp his refuge and home, paying his board by keeping the polyp storks clean of parasites. Coral is limestone, shells of tiny organisms growing in colonies, microscopic creatures who build upward from the bottom. This reef will be a shoreline in 50 years, the reef beyond in 200 years. Thus the sea builds the land. Old markers, once used to designate the channel entrance, made forever useless by the coral reefs. Here where the galleys of Babylon, the merchant ships of Baghdad, and the spice ships of India once entered port in safety, ramparts of coral have grown filling the channel, blocking commerce, and killing the ancient port of [INAUDIBLE], which depended upon the channel for its life. 4,000 years ago, emperors of China-- to trade silk and spices for the ivory and pearls of Africa, and for caravan loads of goods from Nineveh and Babylon. Under Turkish and Arabian rule the city became a slave port, bartering in the mystery of captive Nubians. The British broke the power of the slavers, but it was the coral reefs that made forever useless the ancient channel markers. For his carefully planned program the doctor is to make underwater movies. And Lotte, underwater photographs. Too often our explorer, reporting his expeditions in other [INAUDIBLE], has met the raised eyebrow. The cameras this time will reproduce the incredible life at the bottom of the sea. The cameras are water tight. To equalize the immense pressure of the water in the depths, the casing is pressurized. The clarity of the Red Sea had been a deciding factor in the choice of these waters for the expedition. Here close to the equator, sunlight penetrates to depths of 100 feet and more. A respirator carries oxygen for half an hour and weighs just enough to counterbalance body buoyancy. To fish, man is just another fish. Unlike animals who have learned how deadly man can be, fish go about their business without fear, no frantic flight as from an enemy. Only bottom fish, accustomed to hiding out in the reefs, scuttle away. Like this baby octopus running home to mama to tell her the terrible big fish that chased her. But even the doctor's focusing stick fails to scare off the vast majority. Pencil fish, on route from one reef to another for food. Something to write home about. A find. The camera records the rare and exotically beautiful firefish, the deadly porcupine of the reefs. Each quill is tipped with poison, and brilliant, flaming red warns its enemies, touch me not. Slowly the firefish meanders along the reef like a peacock in all its vanity. It's now Lotte's turn. She comes down with her camera. Our camera girl is looking for just such a citizen of the reefs as Puffle, a perky little perch. To Puffle a camera means perhaps, my picture in the paper? But should a gentleman be concerned about that? Just one moment of your time, please. Oh, how will you have me? Left side? Right? Tail? Oh, all right, lady. Full face. In all her photographic work the lady follows through, does our own processing. No easy task in Red Sea oven heat where the required 68 degrees is almost impossible to maintain in the solutions. Always the question, how will it come out? A good negative. And in the print, Puffle to the [INAUDIBLE]. The urgent business of the expedition demands an answer to the question, to what depth may they work in safety without the respirator? A 75 foot underwater cliff, a sheer drop equal to a seven story building, has been chosen for the test. Leo has promised, I'll go down, touch bottom, and come up fresh as a daisy. The doctor watches. It's easy going for the first 30 feet, but at 45 feet pressure on the ears is building up. 50. 60. 70. All the way down. At 75 feet the pressure is terrific. 52 pounds to the square inch. The critical point is the long climb up, and without oxygen. Afterwards, Leo confesses it was those last 30 feet that sold him on using the respirator. For to his dizzy eyes, the outport above goes into a mad world. Hass applies the lesson of Leo's experience, determines now to teach the use of the respirator and how to conserve its precious half hour supply of oxygen. The oxygen is taken through the month. Valves control the flow. The importance of the nose clamp. Uncomfortable? Yes, but vital to safety. At all times keep swallowing to reduce ear pressure. For the rest of the lesson they must go below. The valves control not only the breath of life, but the equilibrium of the body in water. Once again, Hass reviews in detail instructions on the functioning of his invention. The first little mistake easily could be a last statement. And thus, under the watchful guardianship of her chief, the lady descends. [INAUDIBLE] is completely reconciled to the respirator have their own project. A deep sea hunt to try out their new submarine spear catapults and provide Hassan, the cook, with the makings for a fish stew. Each had qualified for his place in the expedition through experience gained in underwater spearfishing. The range of their catapults is 100 feet, but with accuracy not guaranteed. A grouper! A 50 pound beauty. Leo signals, I'll take him. A hit! But the harpoon fails to hold. A moray eel, a deadly sea weasel of the reefs, ready to pounce from his ambush. Jerry's after him. His job now is to haul the moray out of the reef. Leo spots another grouper, even bigger than one that got away. Jerry gets his moray, but holds those wicked teeth at a respectful distance. The big grouper too. Sundown. Lotte calls, come and get it! Cooked native style, the grouper provides a wonderful meal. All is ready for the expedition's first recording of the language of the fish. Eddie has strung his underwater cable, ready now to transfer to tape the voices of the sea. In the early war years, United States Navy technicians learned that fish sounds register on hydrophones. Eddie turns on the recorder. [FISH SOUNDS] Applying American cowboy technique, Hass now leads all hands below for the strangest round up on record. Purpose? To herd the schools of fish over the hydrophone so their sounds may register. [FISH SOUNDS] And thus is a new chapter begun in the world's book of knowledge. The [INAUDIBLE]. All hands inspect the ship that is to carry them to the open sea, the kingdom of the big fish. The Sudanese captain welcomes them and, his pockets heavy with gold, Abdul the broker sees them off. The [INAUDIBLE] is 80 years old, a lateen rigged Arab dhow with barely enough deck space for sound and camera gear, but room enough for a certain jack-in-the-box camera hound. Leo and Jerry have loaded their spears. Eddie struggles with the last of his cables. [BELL RINGING] [SINGING] Two days out, and the [INAUDIBLE] now approaches her first objective, [INAUDIBLE] Reef. The dhow has proven herself a speedy sailor, well worth her charter price. Aboard, the doctor types up his work schedule and Xenophon has the outboard ready to go. Suffocating heat mars the pleasant interlude of sailing. Lotte marvels at the energy of the boys. They must have their daily exercise, heat or no heat. The Sudanese think they're crazy. Men who run in the sun about to expose themselves as bait for the killer devils of the sea! Allah preserve them! For the first survey of the reef the doctor has determined he must go below alone. His rule has been that he, as the leader, must make an initial reconnaissance, since his is the responsibility for the safety of all. The feeding grounds of the deep sea big fish. The lair of the shark. Here, the coral reefs themselves may be death traps. The problem is to explore the deep foundations of the coral cliffs, find out whether the reefs are safe. If the coral has grown as do forests, then there will always be a way between the trees. Hass must be sure the reefs are not a labyrinth with treacherous, dead end tunnels to trap and drown a human fish. The explorer finds himself a wanderer in an awesome, magnificent submarine cathedral. With each turning, he peers ahead. Will the way be open? The coral cathedral has many doors. The reef is safe for all hands. The green light means action. At last, all hands are to explore the far deeps of the Red Sea, the setting for fearful tales by the natives. Mahmoud jabbers endlessly of sea devils, jinns, ghosts of the drowned, haunts. This day's program calls for the exploration of a deep valley between parallel cliffs, whose towering coral heads reach almost to the surface, the dread of all Red Sea sailors. Hass checks Lotte's respirator, makes sure every control is operating correctly, and in pantomime cautions her to swallow repeatedly as they go down. The boys follow. They are to spread as widely as possible but still stay within sight of each other. Lotte is at the head of the line. Hass is following, keeping her in sight. Resting on the ocean floor, a dim shadow. Some ship sunk so long ago that the crust of coral has grown feet deep. What had she been? Sailing vessel or steamer? A close look reveals the ship's hull was of iron, not wood. But was she propeller driven or of the old paddle wheel type? To the expert eye, the structure of the deck girders tells the story. Here is an old time iron ship, a paddle wheeler, lost probably about 1840. The first clue is a ventilator, definitely of the type used on steamers. With curiosity born of woman, she scans the decks for [INAUDIBLE]. Below decks, the old [INAUDIBLE] reveals still more. Here are no cargo holds, no wide hatches to accommodate large bales. And yet the compartments are far larger than the passenger cabins of the old side wheelers. They had but one use. Prison pens for slaves. Here they had been packed, bound with the old Arab slave knots, ankle to ankle, wrist to wrist. Lotte is trying to visualize what must have happened in that tragic sinking so long ago. The wrecked lies close to the old trade route of the ghost port of [INAUDIBLE], in those days thriving on the trans shipment of slaves from caravans to the ships that plied the Red Sea. By what mischance she struck the reef above, no man now living will ever know. Perhaps some of her crew survived. But for the helpless hundreds below, there could've been no hope. The old [INAUDIBLE] writes its own indictment of man's inhumanity to man in the vanished generation that called [INAUDIBLE] home. The recall. Oxygen is running low and time is running out. This day's job is to film the wilder life of the Red Sea. The big fish of these deeps differ from in shore fish, as do tigers from rabbits. All of them except the calculated risk. Downward through the open passages of the base of the coral. It is important that they know the reefs as a place of refuge if ever the need arise. It is still another 40 feet down to the lowest coral shelf. Slowly, adjusting valves as they go down, they seek the hunting grounds of the killer sharks. The boys are already hard at it. Jerry has a huge tropical starfish with 15 tentacles, each a poison barb. The doctor prepares for what he considers his most important film work, for this is the kingdom of the shark. Hass secures a spare harpoon line to the coral just in case. A school of [INAUDIBLE] fish, primitive deep feeders with blue lumps and yellow teeth. Red Sea barracuda. Here is a hunter ruthless as any shark, yet the [INAUDIBLE] show no fear. In the daylight hours in these bright seas, a truth reigns. Even as on land, antelope herds in Africa graze quietly only yards away from lions. Another wolf pack of barracuda sweep by, harmless in daylight, yet a vivid illustration of a prowl for the kill if it were now the blackness of night. A devil fish scuttles for cover. They keep to the shelter of the reef, for sharks come from considerable distance with lightning-like speed. This one is 12 feet long. Lifelong study has taught Hass that sharks do not see well and do not follow their prey by scent. Their first and all important faculty is a radar-like sensitivity to underwater vibrations. From snout to tail, those sleek bodies have myriads of tiny hair antennas. So sensitive to water vibrations that in the absolute darkness of pitch black night they can run down their prey, can tell from half a mile off when and where a fish is in trouble by the vibrations set up by the erratic fin beats. Scared? She asked for this. The instructions are to harpoon a grouper as bait to register the actions of the shark when he receives vibrations set up by the struggles of the captive fish. The shark circles the bait high up on the reef. The shark strikes, takes the harpoon fish. Another shark. And still another. Cameras make [INAUDIBLE]. A fish in trouble is always the target for the killer shark. Oxygen running low. Hass signals, up. All is in order for the second sound investigation. Do all fish react like the shark? Are they too sensitive to vibrations? Will sound vibrations of human origin produce reactions? Let's find out. Food fish abound in this spur of the Shab Amber reef where the hydrophone is to play. A trial roll is put on the check the functioning of the apparatus. This test roll is jazz. Perhaps it will get some response from below. [MUSIC] It does. Hass has prepared a collection of familiar sounds to be played full volume. The vibrations should reach far and wide. Poor Eddie. He did all the work of the recording back home and now is to miss the fun. [SIRENS] [GUNSHOTS] [TRAIN] [BELL RINGING] [WHISTLING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [HORN] [SHELL FIRE] Bells, sirens, screams, shell fire. The experiment establishes that these sounds from the world above mean nothing in the deeps below. Try music again. Music. Perhaps the rhythm of Johann Strauss' "Blue Danube." Hass long theorized regular pulsations would affect fish. [MUSIC- JOHANN STRAUSS, "BLUE DANUBE"] One camera station is here in the outer coral, 200 yards from the hydrophone. Behold an astounding phenomenon. Pair by pair, they emerge from within the reef in a honeymoon parade, gaily swimming toward the source of the entrancing three quarter beat, the hydrophone. Pair by pair they merge into processions. Utterly, completely disregarding our photographer. Hass, standing over the hydrophone, had hoped for a few responses. He finds himself the pivot of a living wall of fish, circling the hydrophone in the gay, measured waltz of the deep. Be calm. Lulled into inactivity, only in the water is there any degree of relief from the oven heat. So the boys play, joining the porpoises. It's the next morning. Xenophon knows, as does everyone, that the new turban Mahmoud is sporting is dedicated to Allah. Wearing it, he said, will get him a big fish. Below, Leo prepares to help him out. Xenophon can hardly contain himself until Mahmoud's turban is firmly hooked. Whatever this strange fish fooling with his hook may be, Mahmoud is bound he'll catch it. [LAUGHTER] Back to old Raggedy Ann. Drifting for the reef close aboard to port. The lookout's alarm is bad news for the crew. All hands most work. The faithful outboard toes the dhow toward the open water. Again under way with a fair breeze, the crew argues as Eddie checks frequencies. Surely this be strong magic making deep waters talk. The hydrophone hangs suspended in the water 50 feet down to detect the approach of big fish. [SOUNDS OVER HYDROPHONE] The frequency is pinpointed. High in the supersonic range it is steadily mounting in volume. Something big coming up. Cameras, spears. Giant manta ray, horned devils, the jinns so greatly feared by the Sudanese. With cameras and spears at the ready, the divers frantically seek to film the first pictures of the great flying bat of the sea, the dreaded manta. The manta attacks by charging, using his huge wings to beat down his enemies. Those wings are 20 feet across, each a full ton in weight. Lotte exchanges spear for camera. Her idea is closeups. The manta moves his great horns, which are lips, like the claws of a gargantuan lobster. The doctor's idea is to keep the manta from charging. Another spear! But Hass finds a new alarm sounding on the dhow. This one too is coming up. A monstrous shark, at least 40 feet long. The fabled whale shark, a spotted tiger of the sea. Pilot fish, like destroyers escorting a battleship. With the contempt of an elephant for sparrows, the shark ignores these humans about him. That vast mouth easily could swallow another Jonah. Lotte is out of sight of the men. The huge shark blocks all else from their minds. She's after that manta, head I'm toward it for that one big closeup. Too late. She sees a second manta, it's mate, charging. The huge wing smashes down. Unconscious, Lotte sinks into the depths below. The steady beating of their wings carries them swiftly away. Replenish their oxygen and for new film, they surface. Now the first time they miss Lotte. She hasn't surfaced? No. Still below. Instantly the divers are in action. But where to find her in this immensity of water? Unless they can locate bubbles from her helmet, there is no hope. As his eyes scan the coral, Hass calculates how much oxygen remains to Lotte. His own laboring lungs give the grim answer. The oxygen in his own respirator now nearly gone, Lotte can have no more, if that much. Hass signals. I've found her! Never has the ascent to the surface seemed so long. Limp, still unconscious, incapable of motion, they guide her helpless form so slowly up. Nature of the physician takes over. Fresh air and rest. Tragedy has passed them by. Homeward bound, bringing to the world facts new to science. Fair sailing, [INAUDIBLE], and a toast to Hass and his bride to be, and to the brave crew. Yay to all souls of courage who follow in man's inevitable conquest of that other world beneath the seven seas.
