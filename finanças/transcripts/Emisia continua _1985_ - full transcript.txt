You must forget these bloody memories. Forget them! To hell with them! You know what? Come with me to see Magda. She has a friend, a lioness, Zia. She loves heroes who are alive, not dead ones. Don't be an idiot. Lieutenant, things have not become more complicated since your last check up, I mean, its not the worst. The piece of shrapnel on your body moved by 1cm. You see, its come close to a tissue. If it moves to the right I can operate here in Brasov without risks. Or, it can move to the right And then? - I won't hide it from you. You will be in a lot of danger. I wrote a report about your situation after the commission consulted you. The report was approved. Inside me there's a lottery. I could be rich inviting people to bet on my shrapnel, like a casino. Where does it go? Left or right? I die or I don't die? I'm surprised you've not yet received the order for its removal. I was told you're a student at the faculty of history. You could resume your studies. There is no more history, Mr. Colonel Dr. I'm afraid I have nothing to study, You can try. Take this advice from a person who treated, as best he could, victims of the two world mass slaughters. See you in two weeks. Don't be late. I must go to the batallion's repair garage. Been working on that fuel truck for over a week now. Got orders not to come back without it. I said don't be late. And then I must go to the stockpile for gasoline. Another order? - Right From... All impossible missions fail only in your head. Life's hardships never pass you by. Not all of us are gifted to be able to handle such important things. You're going to see the "creations" of Madame Von Horst? They say the entire tank division worked on her paintings. Her husband is in command there. Why should I go there? Its enough that she she already has one fan in our ranks. Wonderful. You think so? Absolutely. What a surprise, herr Captain. Very beautiful. Herr Colonel Vogel, herr Captain Vogel, herr Captain Cernea. Just wait, Captain Vogel is an expert. I'm mostly into sales. Mostly art. I'm an amateur. Let's not talk about work. Let's better see the dramatic paintings. Are you trying to make an allusion to the situation on the front? As an officer, I must watch the front very closely. At the moment, I am a humble guardian of the radio station. If only you knew how bad things are on the Eastern Front, especially Moldova. I was told that there is the Danube and the Carpathians and there is also... how is it called? Nemo... Nemo... Namoloasa. - That's it! We call it Murlini. How African, how exotic! Anyway, you have a job to do. I don't think this is the time or the place for this conversation! With Murlini or not, we are going ahead. Slowly, but surely. I now understand where the inspiration for your art came from. The end of the joyful, innocent child. Typically German. You understood very well and you are also so kind. Pardon me, please. You are needed for official protocol. Excuse me. Wonderful. You came from the hospital? Yes, from the hospital. What did the doctor say? Everything is fine. I'm in perfect health. If lying makes it easier, that's fine. I spoke to him on the phone. He told you that he already sees me as departed? No. Damn, we'll have to wait for the train again. Have a match? - I don't smoke. I forgot. The doctor told me you should be cautious. At least don't play football until the shrapnel is removed. Did you tell him I play football or that I'm a history student? Both. Your humanitarian worry, your pity for my petty person... These came about as a result of the aesthetic emotion, that the art of von Horst stirred in you. I see you don't like our current allies. - You mean occupants, Captain? On the front, I felt like a prisoner, not a fighter. I saw old people, women and children taken hostage, slaughtered like animals. You call these allies? This piece of shrapnel can move left or right so I don't give a damn if you Court Martial me. Don't even think about that. You have come to the sub-unit I've commanded for less than a month. I would like to know if you dislike me because I was not on the front line. Because I am "well-connected", as they say? No, Captain, I dislike you as you admire the paintings of Madame Von Horst without anybody forcing you to like them. You can tell them that I got the spare parts. Have you seen the fuel tank return? - Not yet. Any news? Sublieutenant Cristecu should have returned to base an hour ago already. I'll have to sanction him. I'm asking you to warn him. He is also your subordinate, not only your friend. I'm certain that he went back to... My friend is a declared enemy of aestheticism. I understand that you ordered him not to return until the fuel tank is repaired. Sile! - Father! When did you arrive? - Today. Continue. Something new? - Nothing. Silence everywhere, Lt. Maybe more than usual. At the Battalion? - The Captain on duty is Marinescu. No news from the front. All we know was in this morning's communique. Has sublieutenant Cristecu phoned yet? No, you see, he is a young man and you know... Has the mail arrived? - Yes. Lt! There's something for you too. Sorry, I forgot. Its something official. Medical certificate of reformation Something wrong, Lt? Yes. I am no longer a Lieutenant. The moment you find a piece of land, you till it, eh Petrica? Well, that's what a peasant does, Lt. What else can I do? The land and the gun. But they don't let me seed the land... That time will come. Ana of Dogaru says you will return to the village to be a teacher. To take the place of Mr. Tiberiu, who died last spring. Who is this Ana you speak of? The one with hair like sunrise. The one who seems to have been born out of the waves. She has not yet come to the village hora (dance). You don't seem glad that we came here. You were supposed to go to my brother's village. We went there. But... Sile ran away from home... twice. Why? To look for you. I know they bomb here too. We will leave soon. Is that you, Alecu? - OK, I'll wait. Alecu, salut! What are you doing here? You let us here on the rack with classical music! Alecu, just a moment. I tell you to wait! Captain, are these those we need? Alecu, the thing about the spare parts is no longer an emergency. Ask him what's happening on the frontline. Yes, I told you its no longer urgent. All of a sudden? You had me worried. I made thousands of calls to German to get you those tubes and condensers! You did well. We'll take those too, But for now the Captain has others for us. He has his ways. Better tell me whats up on the front line. - No news yet. Maybe we'll get news at 10 from the joint chiefs of staff. So why play this funeral music? Why change the program? We got an order precisely because of the situation on the front. If you learn something new, call me. How did you doubt me? I'll keep you posted. Salut I just talked to the officer at Radio Bucharest. When the equipment reaches 50% attrition with no spare parts, I get insomnia! Did they cost you a lot? A lot. For three nights I had to listen to the art fallacies of Mme. Gen. von Horst. Plus, I had to express admiration for her paintings, which are not bad at all. Whatever. Tonight you're invited to dinner with us. You coming? Dear listeners, please don't change the frequency. Soon, we will broadcast a communique which is important for the country. How soon? I understand your trip here was difficult. - Your wife did not tell you? Terrible. We stood in the hallway, with the suitcases in our arms. Who has a place to go to runs away from Bucharest. Poor people. - They are overcome by fear of the fortress. Not only that. Even the situation on the front. My uncle, a General, could hardly enter the army HQ today to see his friends. They were all so tense! You know. He had to convince them to ensure Petrica was not recruited in the army. Who is Petrica? - My brother. They talk openly of coming to an armstice for peace with the Russians, their allies. You know all the news. You have more news than the radio in the past six months. But nobody knows for sure. There will be another government, too. What about the political parties? - What about Antonescu? And who do you think will take the responsibility to govern now? The communists. My uncle says its quite possible. All I hear is this Brahms, Brahms! But I want Fox, Tango... Lieutenant... Radu Gherghina speaking. I have the honour, Major. No... No agent arrived yet. Got it, Major. Oancea. Corporal! Run and get the Captain here. Hurry! Hurry! - Got it. Dear listeners, please don't change the frequency. Soon, we will air a communique which is important for the country. What happened? What communique? - What are they saying? Greetings, Captain. We have an urgent order from the Batallion. Please, allow me to leave now. I must reach the other units. Go then. - Greetings. Hide the lights! Oak, extreme emergency... Parvu! Double the sentries right away! Everyone is on alert. One sommation at 50 steps Any disobedience to that, you fire without warning. Execute it. - Got it. Two for each post. This is a general order. One sommation at 50 steps. Fire without any other warning. Got it? - Got it. Execute it! Who leads? First one, then the other. May I make a phone call? Want to play one with me? - We'll play, nea Crisan. Hello, is this Mrs Magda? Mrs Zia, forgive me please. May I talk to sub-Lieut. Pau Cristescu, please? Hello, Paul? Listen to me, nasty man! Put your pants on now and drive the fuel tank back to the base. What? Those from supplies? You drive back right now, you hear? Or I'll shoot you with my own hands! Button up your coat. How long til the fuel runs out? A day and a night, if we only use it to keep the radio on air. Lt. Gherghina! Close your coat buttons. Arrange your uniform. Take a car and you personally bring the fuel tank back to base. Sadly, captain, I was reformed. If I recall well, you insisted I would be. From now on, I'll be studying history. Lt. Gherghina, as long as you wear that uniform, you will respect it! Captain, we've switched to the automatic engine. If there's a power outage, the engine starts by itself Please close the buttons. I suppose Mme. General von Horst would never draw me in such a messed up uniform. Romanians! Our people understands having no masters and taking its fate into its own hands. Anyone who is against the people's decision, is the enemy of our people. Romanians! The dictatorship came to an end. And with that, all oppression has ended. The new government means the beginning of a new era, in which the rights of the country, and citizens are guaranteed. Romanians! Of the courage with which we will defend, with weapons in our hands, our independence against any attack against our right... Mom! Mom! Its peace! Peace! ..to determine our fate, with courage.. Take it to the right! Go right! Lazar, got any tools on you? Nothing aside from the tools to repair the car. I have just a pistol. - Right, right, that will scare them! What should we do now? - Start the car. What happened? The Germans want to capture the railway station! Captain, may I introduce myself? I am Lieut. Paul Cristescu. I must reach the base, the Radio Romania station. You're too late. You can't make it now. Give me a machine gun and bullets. We'll find a way. How many are you? - Me, a corporal and a fuel tank. The only route is on the railways. If we divert their fire to the opposite side. Who is commander of your unit? - Captain Cernea. Shoot at anything that moves or tries to stop us. And you? Lazar, go slowly towards the railway. Yes, I hear you. Congratulations, Alecu Good luck to us all. - Thank God we lived to see this. There is fighting now. They defend the capital surrounded by German military units. These are very difficult battles. The German units in the city have already been captured. The top objectives are achieved. Let's hope we pull through. What is your situation? From the information we have, the surprise stunned the Germans. There are heavy battles at the airport. At Dealul Vartel and Bartholomew Railway Station. Here is the order for you. Order, not indication. You must secure the transmission of the programs through your station. You must be able to replace the broadcast from Bucharest to cover the whole country. So, if the station in Bucharest is taken off-air, The commander of the unit is here and listening to you too. I told him we'd talk. For you and them too: this is an order from the joint chiefs of staff. Your station must remain on air, no matter what. Mr. Radu, are you sick? - No, I'm fine. I think... A bit of fresh air will do me good. Are you worried? Yes. Here is cold water from the fountain. Sublieutenant Cristescu... He's not here yet. Should I send for a doctor? - No. There's nothing he can do. I'm afraid that piece of shrapnel will move in the wrong direction... I will drive you to Brasov. - No, I don't think I can make it. And we don't leave now. What are those? Bayer aspirin. I'm right here... Hello! Yes! - This is garrison speaking. Captain Cernea, it is urgent! - I'll get him right away. Captain Cernea, you have a call from the garrison. Hello, garrison! Garrison, you hear me? Lt., they attacked the gate! Apply the " C case scenario" Do it! Wait, Lt., I will take you to the phone. Gherhina? Gherhina, is that you? - I'm Parvu I will take some men and come get you out of there! Captain! - Forget about me! The women and children must hide in the basement. Take them to the shelter! Don't put the lives of civilians at risk! Enforce the "C case scenario"! Railway station! Hello! Answer! Come on! Fire! Don't worry... I'm here, Lt. Hello, battalion! Take it easy, Lt. I'm going out to be with dad! - You don't go anywhere! I'm going to dad! - Sile! Fire! Prepare the grenade! Corporal Oancea, you take over! Stand up! Stay standing! For my amusement, explain it to me. Because I can see you did not work alone. And I am intrigued by your resistance to our attack. The guards will be here any minute now, order the surrender of the radio station! You know what "C case scenario" means? The objective is we don't surrender, even if we all die. You are lucky we keep you here. We better end this and you surrender the station to us. I don't think so. Are you feeling any better? It seems that the piece of shrapnel has calmed down. We will barricade the windows too. At 6am we must open as if nothing happened. By the way they attacked, it seems they want to open it. They need this radio station. What's the situation? We know nothing of the Captain. - He is either dead or taken prisoner. The women and children? We took them to the shelter. The Captain ordered it. Look who we have here. The Captain. Pathetic but possible. He must be advised or punished. As you see, the situation is serious. Can you take responsibility for this situation? This land belonged to the Bolsheviks! Did we make ourselves clear enough? We will go all the way to Bucharest! Aren't you a bit too arrogant? When you see the power and influence of the German Empire, your courage will desert you. For our land, we always fought in battles. Even now we have enough strenght to fight for our country's independence! Words, words and only words, Captain! The Fuhrer ordered that we open the program tomorrow. Captain... I know it very well, Major. At 6 there will be a wake up call. Yes, the objectives in the city are under our control. Now we are engaged in heavy fighting at Bartholomew ralway station, We took measures to intercept the enemy from Bran and prevented a possible attack from Bod. Comrade Morariu... - A moment. The Radio Romania station has been attacked. I was there. They are surrounded. They resist. The radio station was attacked. Yes, of course. Yes, I understand. The leadership of the Communist Party wants all patriots and workers from IAR, Metrom, and the Railways to support the actions of the military units. Defense of the radio station has become an objective of maximum importance. Comrade, we will immediately organise a fighting detachment. Your mission is to get in touch with them. Undetected, if you can. The radio station must remain in our hands at any cost. We must transmit at any moment the news and indications of our new government. Attention! The commander of the German army is speaking to you, General Ober von Friesnet. The time is 6:09 The Fuhrer has issued the order no. 3041 on 24 August, at the hour of 1:50. In the context of the OKV reform no 0010233944, I quote: Various persons from Bucharest will be arrested! A new regime will be instaurated under the command of the acting General! The German Ambassador is in Bucharest and he supports us fully. The mob (the people) must obey the German army. Good, but all must be done with calm. The program must be aired in the Romanian language. Yes, even before the news program. The orders of the commander must be repeated even at 8 in the morning. If we execute this order, a bright future awaits us. It will not be difficult to take over the station. It will be a certain success. The transmitter is not working. Your disdain does not work either. No problem. The technical problem is solved already. We set the woods on fire, Captain. It would be better if the General and his pitiful wife accomplished the order. And this so I don't know in intimacy the family of the General. Out! Faster! I think this intimacy must be clarified just between the two of us. All of you! Out! I understand your reaction, it is because of your patriotism. I find your behaviour aberrant. At the moment, there are 1600 German soldiers at the Romanian border. [They need to understand that we must] cope with the Eastern front! In this game, only the lucky reach the finals. Your wife and child are here too... You can leave the country tonight, you can go to Germany. We'll find your transmitter regardless. I thought you said you already had it? Lazar, I think this its time. Drive alongside the woods and go full speed when its 200 metres until the base. Got it. Lazar, one more thing. Don't dare die. And you? - I'll be the circus rider again. Let me up there. I beg you. I beg you, let me up. I implore you from the bottom of my heart. But I don't know how to drive the truck. Hit it, Lazare. Hit it. Fire! Let them in! Greetings, Lieut.! I'm the driver. It took us so long because the shop with their damn papers... Empty the truck now! Put buckets where the fuel is leaking. Where is sublieutenant Cristescu? I told him. I begged him to let me up there. I begged him to let me up. But he did not want to. He said he can't drive. He said he cannot drive. Look at him now. Fire! Fire! No German in this courtyard! No German in this courtyard! Fire! This is Radio Bucharest and Radio Romania. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. The time. It was 6 o' clock. Dear listeners, we broadcast the declaration of the new government. Romanians! The dictatorship was removed. The people are regaining their legitimate rights. The political regime we will accomplish will be a democratic one, in which the public libraries and the citizens will be guaranteed and enforced. From this day, Romania considers the United Nations as friendly nations. The fact London, Moscow, and Washington recognize the injustice done to Romania via the Vienna diktat, open the possibility that Romanian troops with allied armies, liberate the North of Ardeal, Attention! - "From under the occupation" Listen to my command. Fire! Fire to kill! Lt. may be better if we attacked the gate directly. See what happened to Cpt. Cernea. I'd be curious to know what happened to him too. Either, he died in the first attack, or... - Or? Or he simply let the Germans take him prisoner. No way he'd do that! Domnule General, my plan was very well organised. You missed the last train. Let's go. Come! All you have to do is surrender the transmitter. If you obey our orders, we will apologise to your wife and kid, and leave them be. I see you'd prefer dead bodies. Captain! I have a letter for you. We must mobilize all men, major. This is the 50th notice Major Kogel has given me. The Fuhrer and fatherland come first! The Fuhrer also ordered that the command be relocated from the Ukraine to Romania. When the Colonel sends news of his proposal we will take over the station. We will act together. - Finally. Whoever is managing the functioning of the station must be here at 7. I understand your demands even if I don't agree with them. They are worth nothing if they are not respected. Your obsession with this place makes me impulsive. Major Vogel agrees with all this? - He will hardly control his anger. 70 men await my orders. Will will inform you when we are in the area. I got it, Major. Hello! I would like to report. Hello! Take some men and go to the front wing. Each take 20 grenades. You personally count them. Got it? This wing is my only weak spot. Do it. We won't let them... - Mine, not yours. They're defenceless. Do it. They've dug alongside the fence. They want a cable that connects to Bucharest. They want to cut it. Are they close? - No but they are getting there. Ionut's boys have started to fire on them. And they cut the phone too? - No way. Its possible that a bomb fell on the cables. I'll try see if I can repair anything. I'll try sneak through the cables. I love you alive, not dead, nea Crisane. You keep an eye on the engine. This is your mission. Nea Petricam, you go up in the building with the tour on the right. You take Lica Stratulat along. You open fire only at my sign. Lica, that hustler? - Maybe, but he shoots well. Do it. - Will do. Thank you. How brave and capable is this Radu, really? If you just look at him, he does not seem a big deal. I heard he had a girlfriend in Ploiesti. A great love. He came from a village, an idealist with great dreams, She was an engineer's daughter. I don't want any. They knew eachother in school. Poor girl was killed in a bomb by Americans. See, the station must be surrendered immediately. So far our plan failed. We followed it step by step. I think there are many civilians here. Use whatever information they give you. In 10 mins, we change the plan and search for informers. We'll bribe them, hunt them down and kill them. The first attack will be at 9:45. Muller, you must organize your team. It won't be easy. We must stop them. I want to take this station by 9:55. I want everything without errors. Meet comrade Tudose. He is a communist. The German and Horthyst troops have invaded from Targu Secuiesc. They may come to help the Germans here. How many? - 2 batallions. Parvu! I hear you. Go right away and mind the station desk. Drag the threads and bring the detonator here. If needed, engineer Stoica will detonate it. Will that be necessary? I don't know. The party asks us to resist until the end. No matter the cost. The entire operation depends on what will happen here. Don't worry. We are in control. Parvu, go! Know anything about Captain Cernea? We know nothing. He could be dead or... You want to know the time, Captain? Look now. You may look at the watch now. I am not interested. Our troops are advancing. The dream becomes reality. The power is ours. The pleasure of victory is ours. Are we here to get a tan? That's fine. Let them get all the medals. Shut up. We don't fire until ordered to. I was very clear about what I want. Think of it as doing me a favour. It will save you from certain death. Surrender the station! You seem to think I am just showing off. I have only one demand. Surrender the station! I can't do it. I can't forgive you either. What more can you do? Wrong. There are many more ways to harm you. I can cause you much more harm. And you won't forgive me for that either. See, Lt.? More pawns. That means they had more reserves, just as I expected. Wait a moment, please. Yes, but he is very busy. He is busy fighting now. Hello. I can't hear anything. I can't understand you. Fire! Kill them all! Parvu, fire! Yes, the radio is on air. The station is working. I don't understand! What? Sorry I yelled, Major. We stopped them again. I'm listening. Yes, let me inform my people. German batallions were stopped by troops who came to our aid. A platoon of paratroopers, patriotic guards. Thank you. The it means we stopped them. Hello, Major. Major! The unit come to help must not attack until we give the signal. Hello. Fire! Or the Germans will fire the cannons! They will destroy the radio station. He's gone. I will go and let them now. What's the signal? The siren which warns against air attacks. You know how to contact them? I'll go the same way that I got here, right? Good luck. - Good luck, comrae Tudose. Careful Your lieutenant is the informant of the devil. Let's see if this will be a first on the battle front. Dress him! Put him down. Slowly. What happened, Lt.? - Nothing, nothing. Is that bloody piece of shrapnel on the move again? It moves sometimes, what else can it do? I'm dying, Lt. If only it was not in vain. Stop! Stop! Attention! Attention! Romanian soldiers! The life of commander Cernea is in your hands! Surrender the radio station to us. Attention! You have just one minute to do it. The life of commander Cernea in exchange for the radio station. Romanian soldiers! Save the life of your commander. The machine gun on the side. The machine gun and a bag of sand! Do it! You have 20 seconds left. Lt. Gherghina, I order you to open fire! That's dad. Captain! You are in the hands of the enemy an cannot order anything. I have taken command of the division. All men listen to my command only! Soldiers, pay attention to me! I Captain Cernea, your commander I order you to fire! It's father! Father! Sile, wait! Sile! I order you to fire! Sile! - Father! Soldiers! Listen to my command! Lt. Ghergina, for the last time, surrender the station. Parvu! You fire when I fire. Lt. but that's our captain! Shut up. You fire when I fire. Lt. Gherghina! - Captain! Please forgive me. I said some nasty things to you. I regret them and ask you to forgive me. Radu, you are a wonderful soldier. Soldiers! You make me proud. Set the alarm. The anti-aircraft alarm! Get down! - Fire! Fire! Attack! In the unavoidable conflict with Hitler's forces... The Communist Party calls upon workers, peasants, intellectuals and all citizens... to fight without mercy, with all our weapons against the mortal enemy of the Romanian people, so we can save the future of our people. We salute the fight of the Romanian people to conquer its liberty and independence, for progress and the glorious future of our country. This film is inspired by the true story of Radio Romania in Bod-Brasov. On August 23, 1944, the revolution for social and national liberation and for anti-fascist and anti-imperialist revolution.
