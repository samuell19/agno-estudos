A TARGET ON THE BACK FREE INTERPRETATION OF A. CAROFF'S BOOK Beer is worshipped universally. No need for an entry ticket, or a code... You don't feel shy in a bar. But when you pick a wine bottle, you always feel like you're taking a test. I would say... Triple Spiegel. A small brewery right after Antwerp. They still have old copper tanks. Triple Spiegel.

Me? Yes. Well, it's done. No no no, not that way! What, what is it? Not that way with beer. Wait... - Can I? - Yeah. Aren't you Christian Schneider? Do I know you? Dimitri Andrea! Well, yes! François Villon College! Year 11! We were throwing rubbers at the English teacher! Back then, you already pissed off everybody with beer. Oh well... Dimitri! So what about you? See, this is my place. Christian Schneider, I can't believe it! Pour him - another one. - No, I was about to leave. How long has it been? What? Since you've been laid? Now, that's what you're missing. You're standing here, sad and old! What was she called, the girl you were dating, back then? - Helen. - That's it, Helen. Oh well... I'm sure you two got married. Yeah. Bingo! Well, I'll go and tell Helen. A small blow-job in the morning, another one in the evening... She died last year. She was in the garden with the laund and she fell at once, just like that. Heart attack. - How old was she? - 49. You know, we think we're free just because we go right or left. A rat in a labyrinth, goes right or left. We're rats, that's all. And there's no cheese at the end of the corridor, so... The labyrinth is in your head. If I want cheese, I buy it and I eat it. What matters is your wallet. Money! Yes, money. Money... It's the key to everything. Life, love... death. Death? Why death? If you go to the locks, you know, behind the slaughterhouse... There's a restaurant called "The Star", ask for Abderhaman. For 20 000 euros, he finds you a hitman. You give him a name, and it's done. That guy swipes the other guy, just like that! Yeah... just like that. Eh, kids! Where's the slaughterhouse? - Up your arse! - Up your bitch of - a mother's arse! - All right. Thanks! Sir, do you know "The Star"? No no, I don't! Hello, I... - I'm coming to see Mr Abderhaman. - Dunno him. Dimitri's sending me. What'ya want? I don't know him. Can't you ask someone, your boss? Yeah, the boss, I'm the boss. So you're ordering something? What kind of beer do you have? Hello. I'm Abderhaman. Can I sit down? Yes, for sure. I'm sent - by Dimitri. - Dimitri! How is he? He told me that you... Well, that I could... Well, I don't really know how it works out. Is there a name you can give me? He's called Christian Schneider. He's my wife's lover. I know him... Just tell me where he can be found. He works for the Central Bank of France. In the mortgage department. He lives 46 Claude Degand Street. You're not taking notes? Next week would be best. He'll be at his holiday home. It's 3 or 4 km away from Wimereux, on the way to Calais. There's... a small track... ...a dirt track, then there's a sign at the crossroad. It reads "The Chestnut Trees". You're right to drink something hot. When it's freezing, I need bubbles. The problem is that I don't have anybody right now. From the 15th of October, I'll have someone. Yeah, that'll do very well. Perfect, perfect. And how do you want it? How? Accident, suicide? We can also hurt him. Right before. But it's more expensive. No, nothing like that. Keep it simple. Can I? Yeah, for sure. You're not counting? I trust you. Goodbye. What about your show, with the company, is it going well? It's in standby mode. The town-hall people don't know what they want. Which one is it? Amber Magbus Galway. They stopped the production. Guess who bought the last bottles? Here, try it. There's some coriander inside. Can you taste it? I think I'll go spend a few weeks at The Chestnut Trees. That's great Dad! It's great if you go back there. Well, won't you feel awkward without... Without mum? You know me, I'm gonna party If you want I can come for 2 or 3 days. Yes, good idea, yes. We'll see about that, I'll call you. ♪ Tonight we're... ♪ Tonight we're setting you on fire! ♪ Tonight we're setting you on fire! We're setting you ♪ On fire! ♪ Go go go! ♪Go! ♪ Go go! Didn't you hear me knock? I wasn't expecting a woman. - Excuse me? - What are you waiting for? Go on. Sorry to bother you. Your garden's on fire. Is that why you're here? That's none of your business. I'm used to it, it's all right, it will put itself o What if an ember flies away? With the wind that's easy. I've got the right to burn old stuff. It's fine. That's what you say. Like these campers who throw away cigarette ends into the scrubland: 300 ha up in smoke. Scrubland, that's in the South! Do you see any scrubland here? And there's no wind! So why did I smell the smoke from the road? I told Charly: "There's a house on fire!" That can always be put out. I'm tired. What do you want? Is "thank you" too much to ask? Maybe I saved your house. Thank you. Happy? I should signal you - to the fire brigade. - Yes, you do that. And what are you doing here? Get out of here, out! Get out of here! Out! Wait, don't move... Come here, Charly, come here! Come here, my fat doormat! Come and give me a kiss! Yes, you're handsome! Yes, you're handsome! Thank you. I looked for him last night. He went away when I climbed inside my car. If I'd known you had him. The seat is all hairy now but... Here, it's on me. I don't know if you like beer. Is that to make amends? Certainly. My house is filled with it. It's a change from flowers. Well then, I'll be off. - You're not exactly close by. - Germans? Not bad. Usually, I don't like English ones. Especially lager. It's often horse piss. I prefer stouts, especially thick ones that stick to the glass. But this one's all right. You sure know about it. My father owned a pub. You're joining me? It's 10 am. Funny. You think you've had it, you want to drown yourself, and you meet a woman. And you're alive. In fact, it's terrible because... ...if your blues can disappear that suddenly, then so can your little happiness. Barley and sweet chestnut. Christina Aubadot. Hello! - Hello! - No, it's freezing! How can you go for a swim in this season? What? I like it! I just love the sea! After my divorce, I needed silence, long strolls along the beach. So I rented out a small villa, after all why not? Can you rub my back? In two weeks time, I'll be back in Valenciennes. Back to my two-room apartment, my small life, my job as a medical secretary... Hello? Christian? Are you listening? Hello, this is Ground Control! Is that it? Are you back with me now? Sorry, I'm always - acting too fast. - No, it's me. Encounters are really funny. What makes them possible? Oh, sorry! Sorry, sorry... - I want to go back. - What's the matter? Nothing, please, I want to go back. - You're all right? - "So, happy?" No, it's not that, it's... It was really good. You're gentle, I like that. So now you're going to disappear? Why would I do that? I don't know. Usually it's what happens with guys. You've got a guitar! I love it! Can you play? Not anymore. Oh, go on! - Go on! - I don't know, pass it over. How do you know that? My first boyfriend taught it to me, an Italian. Since then I've forgotten Italian, but I still know it by heart. So do I, I had learnt it for a girl. Did it work? We were married for 25 years. - What do you want to drink? - I don't know. I'm sorry... I don't know. ...ti amo... Sarà perché ti amo! From the 15th of October, I'll have someone. Yeah, that'll do very well. Sorry Mona. Some urgent work to do, will be absent all day. Please feel at home. Christian. Sir, do you know where the people from... Excuse me, madam. I'm looking for the mobile snack bar which was over there. Have you seen it? It's called "The Star". Does that ring a bell? Thanks madam. Sir, have you seen Abderhaman's snack bar? No, I don't know. You jerk! Can't you watch out? Hello miss. Do you remember me? - No. - Yes, I was here last week, I met Abderhaman. Maybe, I don't know. - I need to talk to him. It's urgent - He's on holiday. Shit. Where? - Dunno. - When is he back? - I told you, dunno. - Have you got his number? - He's always got a different one. - Don't take the piss. - You can reach him. - What is it for? It's personal. I know about his business. You can tell me. - I placed an order. - An order? I would like to cancel. Do you understand? When is it for? Starting from the 15th of October. - How much did you pay? - 20 000. What colour? What colour? Grey, black, navy blue... You're not getting me. - It doesn't matter. - Where are you from? Don't you want a second-hand BMW? Of course. Listen, you give him that number. He really must call me back. It's very important. Can I count on you? It's really very important. Tell him to call me back, eh? Thanks. Mona, it's me. Thanks for calling. I didn't want to do it. Didn't want to harass you. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine... And you? Yeah. Here the weather's awful, we'll have to come back next summer. Yes, we'll see about that. Are you sure you're all right, you sound funny? No no, I'm fine. I'm fine... When are you back? I'll spend the night here. My appointment's been postponed till tomorrow morning. Will you be back for lunch? I bought lots of cheese. The cheesemonger told me to make the most of it as they're going to forbid unpasteurized milk cheeses, because of Europe! Hello? Hello? Little idiot! Let me tell you... Your voice is... magnificent. - And I can tell. - I don't know... It's true I quite like karaoke but... I want to start working in the music production. Get my own little label to take care of artists like you. Christian? What's the matter? I've got a big problem. With Abderhaman. Dunno what you're talking about. I went to the locks. I placed an order. I would like to cancel it. Can you wait for me over there? There's nothing over there, it's a slip road. Perfect, you can go and hitchhike. Go on, get lost. Go, you're getting on my nerves, you're getting on my nerves! You're nuts! - I need help. - And you say tell the world? I'm in deep shit! You placed an order, you must be out of your mind! First of all, who's your target? I can't tell you. "I can't tell you". Help me find Abderhaman. At the locks, the snack bar's gone. I... I just want to cancel. They can keep the money, I don't care. But there's no "After Sale Dept"! These guys are pros. Nobody can cancel an order. Your target's already dead. And now he's throwing up! Oh no, not my shoes, shit! Not my shoes! You're really an idiot! Sorry... If you want to track Abderhaman, you've got to understand that it won't be for free. You've got to spill some cash to a lot of guys, see. How much will it cost me? 7000, 8000 euros. To start with. I can't. I've got nothing left. I've already emptied my bank account once to pay them. Well then... There's nothing left to do. Apart from telling your target to find a hideout. Even so, I don't think it will be much use. Yeah... Everything all right, sir? Yes, all right, yes, all right... - Alex! - Sorry. Come over here... Listen, I won't be reachable - for a few weeks. - What's this getup? Nothing, it's a little long to explain. - Where are you going? - At a friend's. - And your job? - I'm on sick leave. What are you doing? What's all this nonsense? Don't worry. Give me a phone number or an address. I can't. I'll call you. Don't worry, I'm all right. Don't worry. Take care of yourself! - Oh that suits you! - Really? - Did your appointment go well? - Yes, very well. Did you bring me back some presents? No, I bought a few items for myself. Indeed you've raided the shops! Yes, I told myself... We're always at each other's, you're on holiday for two more weeks, maybe it's best if I move here, no? If you want. But we could have gone at yours to get your things. I've only got old stuff. I felt like a change... Do you know how to set this alarm? I'm asking because... With everything you see nowadays... It isn't... What is it? Nothing. I must have forgotten about sharing my private space, that's all If you don't want me to move in, tell me, that's all. Of course you can. Why are you taking it that way? Mona? Mona? Mona! Don't stay outside like that, you'll catch death! What's that for? I was wondering where you were, I got scared so... What's the matter? Tell me what you've done. What do you mean? You change your appearance, you come here to hide... Are you in trouble with the police? Tell me. - No no no no, Mona, Absolutely not. Absolutely not! I want to know if it's serious, then I won't ask anymore questions. Mona, I haven't done anything. Do you believe me? I'm scared. What are you scared of? Christian... I'm... I'm scared of waking up one morning and finding out that you've gone. I always fall in love too fast, like an idiot. Every time I believe in it and every time I am had. Married guys, real... bastards. And it breaks me. For the first time, I meet someone who's nice. So I believe in it even more and... I'm scared to really get hurt. It won't happen, Mona. It won't happen, I promise. So let me recap: you are Christian Schneider, born on the 4th of April 1952. That's right? So, in order to kill yourself, you get in touch with "Brahman", a mysterious hitman who works in a chip shop. But you change your mind, you don't want to die anymore. Problem: the chip shop closed down. It's Abderhaman! And that's not where he works, it's the meeting point. Abderhaman, is that the hitman? No he's... he's... A kind of intermediary, like an agent, he's got employees. He gets a commission, he organizes everything, but he's not the killer. - I don't think so. - Very well... We'll see what we can do. Sign here. Mr Schneider! Forgive my colleague. He was clumsy. Do you believe me? Yes! But really you shouldn't worry. For 3 or 4 years now, we've arrested small-time crooks. They promise everything: resident's permits, narcotics, they take the money - and they disappear. - He seemed quite serious. They always seem serious. They dress well, speak well... And then they disappear. Don't be ashamed if they fooled you. It's just swindling, they won't kill you! - You don't look too good. - Well I haven't slept much. Where do you live? I'll give you a lift, you're not fit to drive. - I'm fine... - Go on, climb inside. But wait... We'll still look for that guy. I can't promise you we'll find the money, but still! Where do you live? Climb inside! I can drive, I don't need you. Get out! Let me be! What's the mat... ? And about Christian Schneider, what do we do? Yes, I understand... Yes... As soon as possible, no problem. So? We're not canceling. He knows too much. He's shit scared, he won't talk. For now. He's just a loser. He gave me his number. I can tell him we're canceling, and we keep the money. Did someone ask for your opinion? Go take care of your little brother, instead of sticking around. Get lost! We go till the end. We finish. Just like we planned. And Dimitri? This shit is all his fault. Yeah, it's all his fault. You did well to call me back. - You have what I asked for? - Yeah. - Here. - Wait, not here, not now! See, you had some savings. I've taken a loan. You don't want to name your target? It would be easier. He's a work colleague. Piss off, it's none of your business. Let's go. - I'd rather take my car. - You sure? Yeah. Go slowly! Wait, there are radars everywhere! Last time they flashed me because I was 4 km too fast. Is it far now? Who exactly are we going to see? A friend, he's already worked with Abderhaman. - Can he cancel an order? - Maybe, we'll see. Come on. Slowly. Where are we? This place is really unsavoury! - You've got the cash? - Yeah. Wait for me here, OK? Do you know where's Mickey? Over there at the back... OK thanks. - How are you Mickey? - Well darling. Here. Let's go! D'you have one for me? Want a blow-job? It's 10 euros. No thanks. A handjob then? 5 euros. Just leave me alone. - So? - We've had it. What do you mean? I told you we've had it. Come on. The hitman's already in town. He's at the Plaza. Apparently he's quite good. A former boxer, used to be in the Legion... So we know who it is! We can call to cancel! - It's too late. - But why! It doesn't work like that! There are intermediaries, procedures. It's very compartmentalized my friend! This is all bullshit. Go on, give me my money back. I'm sure you've kept it. - My money! - I've kept nothing, you jerk. I did it for you! Now they could kill me! Give me my money back! My money! All right, feeling calmer now? Eh? Understood? You're a real jerk. Christian... you're it, eh? You can tell me you're it. What? The target. Last year I went through the same thing. I emptied... ...a triple Jack and I put the gun in my mouth. I stayed like that on the loo for an hour. I couldn't even pull the trigger. Here. Keep it. In case they find you. You shoot them before they shoot you. Leave France tonight. But I can't, what would I do abroad? I've got my kid here, it's not possible! No, but... Forget all that. No, wait, you're not gonna cry? Don't you worry, it'll get better. Don't cry. I'll get something to drink? - No, I'll be fine. - We've just been delivered... ...with a new beer... an Irish one. That way... You can tell me, because, you know me... I know shit all. Fuck! Non, it's not poss... Fuck! Mona. I tried to wait for you but... What time is it? Mona, I promised I'd tell you if I had to leave. Well here, I'm telling you. But what's going on? What happened to you? There's a contract on my head. - What? - A contract on my head. You know what that is? They're gonna kill me! I fucked up, I'm in a real mess. I can't explain, it's too long. I've got to leave. And fast! And far if possible. Do you understand? Well, I'll take my things. - I made some coffee. - Thanks. I'm almost finished. - Is this story for real? - Yes, Mona, it's for real. So you're leaving right now? Yes. How about you came with me? Like, now? Yes, we don't have the time to think. But... ...I can't, I... I like you a lot but I can't. Mona! It's going too fast, I can't. We'll be together. What's holding you here? Nothing! So I left the keys under the big window box, next to the parasols. All right, I must be going. Thanks again, you're great! That was my cousin. She'll take care of Charly. There's a departure for Berlin in 45 min. Afterwards, no plan. Eastern Europe, we'll see... Have you got your ID? Go get a coffee, I'll take care of the tickets. 368.40 euros, sir. Are you paying by card? Cash. All right sir. Here are your tickets. If you please? Your tickets. You can check in your luggage Desk 14. Boarding will start in 20 min Gate 2. So? What d'you want? Same thing you do. Make up your mind! - Come over! - Have you got the tickets? We're not leaving. What would I be doing in Eastern Europe? - What are you going to do? - Find them and cancel the contract. - They're going to kill you! - If they don't kill me they'll let me be. It'll be over. I can't live like this anymore. It drives me crazy, it's got to stop! - So I'm coming with you! - No! Wait, take a cab. Go back to the villa. I'll meet you when it's over. Don't go, I've got a bad feeling. Stay with me. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. Order a seafood platter for tonight. - No, Christian, no! - Calm down! Everything will be fine. It won't take long. Wait for me, wait for me! Lille Plaza Hotel, hello! Hello. I'd like to speak to Mr Hector Lamberto, room 606. I'm Mr Bodwin. There must be a mistake. Mr Lamberto is room 1010. I'll put you through. You idiot! You scared me! Why isn't he dead yet? I thought I'd do it in Berlin, when he wouldn't be so suspicious. He changed his mind. He's too cautious. I can't act carelessly. It's been weeks. You fuck him. And you haven't had the opportunity? I'm going to believe that? I'm taking my time. No risk, no trace, like you always say. - Hector Lamberto? - Yeah. I'm your target. Christian Schneider. I've got to talk to you. Come in. How did you find me? It doesn't matter. You're going to call Abderhaman. You'll tell him the contract's been fulfilled. You'll leave town. That way, it'll be over. I'm fed up. It's all got to stop. - Where's the phone? - Over there. Go on, call him! Go on! And why would I do that? I've sent a letter to my lawyers. I'm telling them everything I know. If anything happens to me, even an accident, they call the police. All right? - What's funny? - "All right"? Who do you think you are? I can see you training in front of your mirror your eyes closed like "I'm Charles Bronson." You're not Charles Bronson, You're Mr. Bean! Back off! Back off! And now what? Call Abderhaman. I haven't got his number. He calls me. If you want to kill me do it in the bathroom, - it's easier to clean. - Don't move! The tricky thing is the blood in the washbasin. Even if you rinse it, they still find traces. Don't move! First the safety catch. You've already got your money. It should be over by now. Do you want me to mess up your face? I don't know what's going on between you and Schneider. I hope you're not in love or something of the kind. No. Not you, eh? That can't happen to you. You're not that stupid. You're mine. You're mine. He's in a right state, up there. He asks if we can trust you. Stop messing around Mona. Finish the job. I'll finish it. I promise. I'm not here for you, imbecile! There's someone else! I'm not here for you! Clean up and it's over. I killed him! I killed him, it's over. I killed him! I killed him! - But who? - My killer, he's dead. He tried to get me but... ...I had him! I'm telling you I killed him. It's over, it's over! He's dead, eh. He's dead. It's over! Have you done what I asked you to? - What? - The seafood. I didn't think about it, I forgot. I told you about the seafood, shit! Shit, I'm starving! All right, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's over. It's all right, it's over. It's over, it's over. It's all right. It's over. Sorry. Sorry. It's over. It's over. We were good together. I had never known that. Not even with my wife. To start with, you played a role: the woman in love. And then it all tipped over? You stopped pretending, eh? Christian, will you keep your beard? I like it. Christian? Christian. Yes? I'm taking care of it. Yes, I had understood that... I don't know how he did it. He came back all excited. He didn't want to talk about it. I'm doing it. If you hadn't called it would already be done. No, don't move. It's my job. I'm here for your friend! There's someone else! I'm telling you, there's someone else for you! Mona? It's me. Christian. Why did you take off like that? Where are you? I'm not sure. I think somewhere close to Escalles. I felt like driving. Just like that... I don't know what took me. - Have you heard on the radio? - No. They found the... Well, the man you... At the hotel? The police thinks it's the underworld, a gangland killing. - Apparently, there's no witness. - So much the better. You've got to come back. - Hello? - I don't know what to do. Listen, you can't stay like that, we've got to talk. Christian, do you hear me? Are you there? Yes I'm here. I... I want to see you. I need you. I want to see you too. Will you be back soon? I'd rather meet you at mine, all right? All right. I'm on my way. Oh, shit. How long have we known each other? I don't know. 20 years. When I met you, guys would sell their car to spend a night with you. They were nuts. And the American who flew over for an hour with you... - Remember? - No. And then you got old. So did I. And Eastern girls landed like grasshoppers. They slashed prices. That's when we thought about our reconversion. We started to do what we do know. Love... You don't even know how it works. It's been years since you've slept with a man without killing him. Yes. Apart from you. I pay you. I must admit your Christian's nice. It's a change from the usual clientele, eh? The bosses, the villains... I understand why you like him. But he... ...he will never love you. When he'll find out who you are, he'll be sickened. He'll run away. You know it, don't you. So don't start dreaming. It's no use. Do your job without complicating things. All right? Come inside. - You're soaked! - Have you got a towel? Er... Yes, I've got one here. Why all these candles? There's often a power cut when it's stormy. Are you all right? Wait... We've got all our time! We've got all night long. Come and watch this. I've prepared something. Oh! What's all that? I brought up a few bottles from the cellar. They're all different. Hope you're thirsty. You're really crazy. I like choice. And how do you spend your evenings, do you class them in alphabetical order? Do you dust them? I talk to them, I give them nicknames. You really know them all? Yes. All. All, all, all... All. Want to bet? Yes. Careful, no cheating, eh! No no, promise. If you cheat, it doesn't count. I recognise them just by their gurgling sound. I'm unbeatable. You can open your eyes. - Shall we start? - Go on. Beer is worshipped universally. No need for an entry ticket, or a code... You don't feel shy in a bar. But when you pick a wine bottle, you always feel like you're taking a test. I would say... Triple Spiegel.. A small brewery right after Antwerp. They still have old copper tanks. Triple Spiegel. Barley and sweet chestnut. Christina Aubadot. A femme fatale. We were good together. I had never known that. Not even with my wife. I know we didn't meet by accident. I know you're paid to kill me. How long have you known? To start with, you played a role: the woman in love. And then it all tipped over? You stopped pretending, eh? I never stopped. Do you really think I'm drawn to you? That killing you is a problem for me? Well you haven't done it all that while. Do you think you'll do it tonight? One left. I'll drink it. Wait... Christian, why did you come back? Have a guess? You don't realize who I am. All the wrong things I've done. I don't give a shit. I know you're lost, so am I. I was lost when we met. All I know is that I like you, that you're beautiful. About the rest, well I couldn't care less. You're so beautiful Mona. Is Mona your real name? No, it's Isabelle. - I've lied so much. - You're forgiven. And all the other men? You're forgiven. - Christian, I killed them all. - So what, you're forgiven. I'm yours my love, I'm yours. - I'm yours! - Yes... I know... I know... I know... It's done. Poison? In the first glass he drank. Are they any traces? There'll be no investigation. The place's filled with candles, empty bottles. ♪ Sarà perché ti amo ♪ E vola vola si sa ♪ Sempre pi in alto si va ♪ E vola vola con me Go on... No regrets.
