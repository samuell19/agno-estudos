Title: PATTAS (FIREWORKS) (Neyyattinkara Sub jail) Don’t presume her to be like other woman She has mastered the art of Adimurai ( ancient Tamil martial art) She has pierced the throat of the foreigner who killed her child Sakthi Sakthi Leave me I hate that laugh Sakthi Wake up Sakthi Sakthi! Sakthi Sakthi He broke my leg The new sun has come into my house It plays beautifully The shoulders are loaded with joy When I lift you, my hunger vanishes You are the shadow near me that will bloom to the dawn You are the one who spreads through the sky You are the abundant beauty that glows Come dear the best language The path that the flowers have opened I am the broken statue You are the life that blossomed from it Can the water go away from the sea Can the fish live on the shore Every second as I think of you, my heart melts This small face in its purity, wipes out all the pain that I endured To cherish you again in my lap, my womb is in penance To lead a life without you; where do I commence ? You are the only reason for my existence Will the sun ever vanish away from the sky? Is there a purest form of love better than a mother's love?

Go away from here Just go I will take care Take the child and leave Sakthi Go to some other place Go. Listen to me I'll follow After I regained consciousness and saw You were at their feet The institution which was built with passion was tainted as One that was built without proper permissions and there was An electrical short circuit and it burnt the place down Nilaparai easily closed the case on those grounds My testimony that I killed Edward to safeguard you was not accepted The police searched the entire forest and could not find you My statements proved to be false I was sentenced to life for killing a foreigner I heard your mourning sound on the foothills I carried you from there For 6 months you could not speak When someone called out Sakthi you responded Only then I knew your name was Sakthi Every day I was in jail I searched out for every single information about him As soon I was released I came there to kill him It was there that I saw you I also knew about the tournament MMA that he was going to organize Our dreams that were shattered, I decided to revive it You should participate in MMA You should show the world what’s Adimurai Till then I will be your Mentor Hey, Firework Where are you both? Can’t find you? As mother said, winning this tournament is secondary Killing him and laying his head on my mother’s feet will be justice served Listen!

Yes Ganga, as fixed MMA will happen in 3 months Do you know who came? I enquired well. Its Diraveyum’s son Sakthi I thought he was dead All the leftovers are after my life If I had left his corpse they would have celebrated and worshipped him after death That’s why I burnt him to ashes Now because of the same form and fire I am having trouble Another thing He’s a thief What? They have seen him nab the bag from that lady Diraveyum’s son is a thief? It’s delightful to hear this Unnecessarily I killed my father Had he been alive now I would have asked him to look at the state of Diraveyum’s son If I die this second, I will die with joy Who are you? What are you up to? Where are you abducting me to? Stop the car! Stop it! You idiot! Who are you? Have you seen me somewhere? I came with the rage to kill you here Only after you spoke I realized What a big blunder I was about to commit What my mother said was right I will participate in the tournament that you are going to conduct I will win over you It’s not a pride to just add the father’s name as the last name One should live up to that name I will live up to it My name is Sakthi Sakthi Diraveyaperumal Come here to defeat me I am coming alone, come and face me Come here to defeat me I am coming alone, come and face me I am filled with rage The technical head of MMA is the overall deciding authority We are sending Sakthi’s application to him These are remains from what was burnt down in our institution Can you do the triangular sutra that you performed that day? It’s momentary. It won’t come just like that Even the mythological Abimanyu learnt charkayug partially In his mother’s womb We have thought you that fully You should start with the primary step advance further, reach the zenith and then stand firm Master In the MMA tournament we are going to conduct, representing Adimurai... Sakthi Diraviyaperumal will be taking part. Do the necessary formalities It is a sign of respect from me towards Adimurai Okay Master It’s my pleasure I was wondering how he will enter Someone is helping him Let him come. If we finish him outside, it’s a murder If we finish him within the cage, it’s a sport Mettalian He’s Mettalian He was arrested on charges of drugs and is in Bangkok jail He has told us to get him on bail He has so far killed 6 opponents in the cage Nilan's plan is to finish off Sakthi You found a job for one lakh a month Why don’t you leave? The job that you do for the ones you like is no parallel for money Ones you like? What's with that stare, Cylinder? Rain's pouring down! So you won't bathe tomorrow Even in those times I was His mother is coming Stillness Hand movement Jump Mother Take a step back Be alert. You can do all this later Stop it now She’s in no mood for all this His techniques are fairly fine He does not have the fire of his father I don’t know his techniques I can’t even remember in my dreams How can I match his skills? You can Leader! Leader! Leader! As the head hails high The nerves split in rage As it enters the arena It manifests manifolds to valor In the presence of yore The evil will banish As you enter all alone The time is right for you being your innings The wicked foxes who tease you Should be burnt to ashes with the fire from your forehead The stage is waiting to see who will lose The wounds will transform you to be a winner To fall and rise is the nature of a warrior There’s no end in a war The stage is waiting to see who will lose The wounds will transform you to be a winner To fall and rise is the nature of a warrior There’s no end in a war In two weeks we have MMA match on behalf of Nilan academy You should all reach it to the public Come here to fight me I am coming all alone. Come here I am burning in rage. Come now Come here to fight me I am coming all alone. Come here I am burning in rage Come now To combat him for the first time Adimurai martial arts Sakthi Diruveyaperumal I thought you will die in prison I thought you won’t come For the sword placed on my neck, I still have scores to settle Kanya Your son’s death will avenge that Nilaparai, treating Diraveyum as your enemy is your fault Not considering Sakthi as your enemy is a bigger fault Has your son fought in about 100 MMA matches? Don’t pin hopes Having tried for many years, I could not master Adimurai Will he learn it in 3 months? Adimurai is just an art that you learn It’s his blood Come on Sakthi How bro? It’s our Adimurai, won’t we know We will win - Which place are you from? - Keezhadi Play as you like Break him down! Sakthi Apply the technique and come to the lion form Sakthi Come out The game is over Wow! Sakthi used his Adimurai technique... and have knocked out Mettalian, whom nobody could knockout so far The countdown is on, let's wait and watch Adimurai Cheer him up! Come on! In the meantime during the chaos Mettalian attacked with iron rod Its still unclear if he can compete in the next round Only after the medical certification will it be clear He has to take at least a week’s rest He can’t play the next match Doctor he has to play the next match With just his left hand how can he play the match Look for our F2F committee we have certain norms I can’t give a fitness certificate As a foster partner I am fretting. How can you be like this? I accidentally brought them up as thieves Till date the police have not hit them I always shield them I took such care of them You want to send him to fight with a broken hand! He will play the next match The emotions are running high! Give him the certificate Let him come and play Puncture that Mettalian who broke my son’s hand, I will... Does that broken hand hurt? Does it hurt a lot? For onlookers like us it hurts. Won’t it pain for him? Correct Just have a peg a sleep You will wake up brisk and see how you spin in the morning Wait dear, pour it I am having Not for you for him Mentor That old man with the beard? Looking at him I can say with a pinch of pickle he can have a full bottle Just treat is as a medicine and have it When you were a kid, I used to give this... I was making him practicing You call your mother as Mentor What fault did our Firework do that she’s hanging him upside down and training him You drunkard. We are hanging upside down What? Oh my My liquor will now flow through my nose Yes this is ambidextrous He has the same power as his right hand on his left hand It shows the same power on both hands for you Sakthi has advanced to the semi-finals He will face Undefeated champion, Richard Nilan Richard wait for the right time to hit continuously on his right hand And punch his collar This is to be our game plan Rabbit punch It’s unethical Sorry dad. Its against the sport The man who killed our academy guys, Mettalin It’s a huge mistake that you brought him back Now you are asking me to do the same mistake You can win him right? Go do that Tell me Sadhana Through Richard, Nilan has planned to hit you on the neck Through a rabbit punch and kill you right there in the cage And one more thing Tell me Hello, Sadhana I can’t hear properly Hello Sakthi it’s time for the match Ask her what it is? Bro... They have hit Sadhana and broke her face Just a minute Hey what happened? He found out He has asked his son to use unethical ways to hit you Watch out All the best Former champion Richard Nilan has given a walk over So Sakthi Diraveyaperumall goes to the finals Sakthi , don’t lose your composure in anger Let the final match get over. We will see What Kanya? Are you scared something will happen to your son? What dear? Hiding behind the back is called Adimurai? Is this what your mother taught you? I would have let him if he was in anger He is after your life Get lost Who? He? Will he kill me? Come hit me Hit me Can we have an agreement fight? Right here? Even if you walk away now Tomorrow you will be disqualified I will say that you threatened my son... and got a walk over He won’t be alive to testify it’s false For the pride I have killed my father Is it your father’s blood in your body? I am doubtful of that Sakthi today your fight is not inside It’s outside If you stare at me I will burn you down If you think of touching me I will break you to pieces Are you ready to face me alone I am ready to come alone Inform your near and dear ones My hand! It’s my father’s blood Get lost There is no link between the agreement fight and MMA Sakthi Diraveyaperumal can fight in the finals Our new cage warrior champion The undefeated Sakthi Diraveyaperumal Me participating in this game Is beyond winning and losing There’s something more important behind this Usually... there are parents who fulfill the child’s dream I stand here as a privileged son who can fulfill the parents dream My father’s name if Diraveyaperumall He scarified his life to promote and preserve our traditional practice of Adimurai His dream was to reach this Adimurai to everyone Now my mother’s dream is also the same Beside Adimurai... we should not forget the pride, culture and purity of this soil... in the name of being civilized We should ensure the next generation is well aware of this That's all. Thanks My mom is my mentor. Big thanks to her Stop talking about my dream. What is your dream? Now there’s a person called Bruce lee Who has promoted his country sport Kung fu by acting in few movies and promoted it to the world What a big achievement Like him, if not to the whole world At least the people of Tamilnadu should know about Adimurai That will give me happiness That's my dream Adimurai, the Tamil martial art... is being considered to be recognized as a sport by the Tamil Nadu sports ministry Sakthi Diraveyaperumall's speech after winning the MMA competition in Chennai... is considered to be the starting point for recognizing Adimurai
