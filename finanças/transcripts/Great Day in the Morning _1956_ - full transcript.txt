Thank you, gentlemen, and ma'am. I've always been lucky, but I never expected to draw three aces. Were you alone down there? No one else with you? I'm most always alone, but I welcome company now. Where are you from, mister? Georgia? Louisiana? - North Carolina. - Just as bad. I can smell a Southerner a mile off. A smell I don't like nor the breed. Ungodly, slave beatin', slave tradin', rebel secessionist. Not fit to live, none of you. Sorry we saved your worthless hide. Well, you did and I owe you something for that. I'm asking you not to make me forget my debt. Listen to that fancy talk, just like that low down, whiplashin' Johnny Reb. And a tinhorn cheat to boot judging by your looks. Put that gun away, Zeff. You might wait for the war to start before fighting it. I agree. My name is Owen Pentecost. I'm going to Cherry Creek. Or Denver as I hear they're calling it now. So are we. I'm Stephen Kirby. This admirer of yours is Zeff Masterson. I hired them both at Fort Laramie to ride with me to Denver. They're taking orders from me. If you're willing to take orders, you can ride with us. Yours to command, ma'am. Forget it, Zeff. Aim those whiskers of yours at Pike's Peak and keep them pointed that way. Now move. As soon as I find what I want, I'd like you to feed the mules and watch over my belongings until tomorrow morning. Then your job is done. Those all your pretties? All those packs, all those mules? Well, not all mine to wear, mine to sell. I'm opening a store here. Catering to my lady at the wild frontier? Why not? I know style, had a little money. Took a chance on Denver women. Holy Jehoshaphat! I've been riding shotgun on a load of lace drawers. Good evening. I'm Father Murphy. My church is right over there. Mass tomorrow morning at six and nine. Thank you, father. Crossing the Rockies safely is something to be thankful for. Lucky trip for me too. I wouldn't mind saying thank you. I like to sleep late on Sunday morning. I'm always willing to gamble on anything, even going to church. Toss a coin. You call it, Miss Ann. - Heads for the church. - Tails for the devil. Tails it is. Only fair to make it two out of three. No thanks. I'd rather make my conversions the hard way. The young lady looks rather tired. Perhaps I can help you get settled. Come along. This is Phil, porter and room clerk. These folks just got into town. Before somebody tells, you might as well know. They call me Phil the cannibal. Don't be scared. It was only once. Man eats somethin' he shouldn't just once. Right away they start callin' him names. This young lady wants a room. Hot water and a bathtub. Hey, boys! Look at the free leg show! Every girl oughta wear them pants. There oughta be a law. There oughta be a law every girl got a figure like that! They don't mean any harm. They used to make fun of my skirt. I'll see you to your room, Ann. I paid you to see me across the Rockies, Stephen. I think I can cross the room alone. No Southern chivalry. Please, Mr. Pentecost? Worth the excitement. They sure are tight pants. Must make you uncomfortable. - Your wife? - No. - Your girl? - No. Are you thinking about stakin' a claim up there? Will you sleep better tonight if I tell you? I won't sleep at all. I just got up. Time to go to work. Go ahead. Tell me. Well, she and I were traveling companions. To save you asking the next couple of questions so are... two other men. What's a man from that dear old Dixieland doing way out here? Most Southerners are thinkin' about leaving before the war starts. Gettin' out while the gettin's good. You must like to take chances. What's your name? Owen Pentecost. High-soundin' name. Guess maybe that's why you took it. Oh, I just heard you got back, Zeff. Folks around about are anxious to hear the latest news. - Will there be a war? - What'd you hear? - Are we gonna fight or talk? - There better be a war. There's good men in North who ain't standin' for shillyshallyin'. Just itchin" for that day we march down South and stamp out the whole dirty breed of slavers and rebels. It's gonna be a dirty war. It ain't natural for brother against brother. Don't you go callin' that Southern scum my brother. I had me a brother. He stood side by side with John Brown from bloody Kansas to Harpers Ferry. And they hung him like a dog. Alongside John Brown. Stay away from him. Nobody helps him. He's got it comin' to him. He's one of those Missouri men. Half North, half South. Roostin' on the fence lookin' for the safest side to light on. Well, this ain't no soft war and there ain't no brothers! Just friends and enemies! And every loyal man knows that's the truth. - Sure, sure we do. - Let's teach him a lesson. All right, Zeff. You've won the round and the fight. Zeff makes a lot of sense, Mr. Means. Us loyal men got plenty of enemies in this town. We don't want to see your ugly face in town. So get movin'. I told you once before stop shootin' off your mouth and crackin' heads. They need crackin". Need it real bad. Sure they do, but at the right time. With them all riled up here, they'll be startin' a riot. Next thing, in comes the military. Let 'em come. We'll start the war here. There's plenty of Southerners to shoot at. Don't need any soldiers comin' and givin' orders. It took me a long time to get things runnin' the way I wanted. You got a good part of this town in your pocket. I've more pockets. All I need is a little more time. Then we can take care of the army. Say, boss. There's a new man inside. A Southerner to boot. Calls himself Pentecost. Been puttin' a big dent in the Federal Bank. All right, I'll be right there. I'm all for you, Zeff. We're both on the same side. Only wait a little. Might be a long war. What are you waiting for? Start the game. Mr. Pentecost. I'm Jumbo Means, proprietor. When I first set out to see the world, a drunkard took one look at me and yelled, "The elephant's loose" and immediately signed the pledge. Since then, an elephant's been my good luck charm. Now. What is the secret of your remarkable luck? A complete indifference to elephants. One of us must be wrong. Which one, Mr. Pentecost? Shall we see? I'll pass the time with you. I'll get a table ready, sir. Why are you so good to me? I get a percentage of the profits. Doin' all right, aren't you? There's always room for improvement. For a smart girl? For a smart girl, and this is the spot. The best place in downtown Denver. You found elephants? Trained ones. When they get wild, they can be dangerous. Heard there's a man who arrived from our part of the country. Oh, yes. Uh, Mr. Owen Pentecost. Are you acquainted? No. But if he's from the South, we'd like to welcome him. We could use friends on our side. So few of us, so many of them. I hope it'll be peaceful. Sunday morning, too. Your luck still holds, sir. This is the second straight hand you've won. You're not betting? I don't think the hand's worth it. It's a pretty hand to throw away. But it can't beat four kings. Yes, four kings, Mr. Jumbo. I know your hand as well as you know mine. Then you're cheatin', sir. Maybe you might call it that. You rung in a deck of marked cards. I can read them as well as you can. What do you expect me to do? Shut my eyes and lose my shirt? Thanks, Pentecost. And he did have four kings. That was fast work, Mr. Pentecost. You'll be a useful man to know. Dirty Southern trash. If I had my way, I'd run you all out. Not if Abe Lincoln's in the White House. He'll back us up. This is no put in of yours, Rogers. You fellows from up North stick together. Why shouldn't we? The name's Rogers, Mr. Pentecost. That's Robinson and Ralston. All from Georgia. Heard of you. Heard a great deal. - We might've a lot to discuss. - We might at that. Are you one of us? I'm from way down South, in Vermont. Go back to Georgia, the whole lot of ya. Colorado's gonna belong to us loyal Union men. The only part comin' to you is six foot of ground dug deep. Shut up with that music. I guess you don't wanna hang around with these hotheads anymore than we do. Him and his crowd is your horned enemies. There are no flags on gold, North or South. So if you'll excuse me, ll got a poker game goin'. Not with me, sir. Since you're a stranger here, I'll give you another chance. With a new deck.. ...and an honest deal. Anything you want. Honest or dishonest. Make it dealer's choice. I don't trust that Pentecost one little bit. Maybe we've been judgin' him wrong. He's a Southerner, born and bred. If he was to come visit-- You ain't thinkin' of lettin' him snoop around the mine. We don't allow nobody to do that. Well, he said he might have a lot to talk to us about. What do we know about him? Nothin'. Except he's back there hobnobbin' with Yankees. Of course, if he came alone he couldn't do no harm, could he? It might be kinda nice to talk to a man from home. We got bad ones at home, too. And I'm bettin" he's one of them. Maybe you're right. One hundred. One hundred. And.. ...500 more. Up 2000. Call. Well, I'm done. Finished. You've taken all my cash. But I intend to have it back, Mr. Pentecost. Oh, legitimately, I promise you. Just one more hand. What are you bettin'? IOUs? No. The Circus Tent. Bar, hotel, warehouse, stock, everything. Everything against my own money. All right. Cold deal. Five cards high. Since ll don't trust you any more than you trust me, shall we leave it to the lady to deal? First card to our guest. Three eights. Strong hand. This is just in case you act disappointed if you don't draw the third queen. If you get your queen, I'll put the gun away and you'll have your money without any trouble. My last card, please. You asked me to deal. You lost. Now, you either gotta pay up or get killed. Yes, I lost, Mr. Pentecost. But I'm not a loser. Let her tell you that. That cheatin' no good woman. We're not dead yet. Across the street would be a good place to open up again. What're you gonna use for money? There's plenty of patriotic money back East for a loyal man. All of a sudden you're drunk. I never show it till I relax. I'm very relaxed now. Come here. Hey, you know something? Jumbo's right, that was a crooked deal. Mmm. But only the last card. That was supposed to be another queen for Jumbo. I saw you switch it. I had a sudden thought. It'd be nice to be under new management. Now, don't get too relaxed just 'cause you're the new owner. And don't get too flattered that I slid the card from the bottom of the deck. Men are awful quick to flatter themselves. Sure, we're dogs, unfeeling dogs. I wonder what a feeling dog is like. Not like Jumbo. He did me out of a hunk of my cut here. Kept books that make great reading if you like fiction. Sad fiction at that, I bet. I don't cry. Oh, I can see you're not the crying kind. Well, not that I haven't done my share. Men? What else? All the way from Boston to San Francisco and back to Denver. But ll always end up laughing. Like now? Like now, I think. How do you know I won't give you a dirty deal? I don't. But you gotta be better than Jumbo. And... you look a whole lot better. Feel better, too. What are you doing so far from the old plantation? There was a little trouble. I took the blame. - For something you didn't do? - Boy, I did it all right. That's why I took the blame. - Get out of here. - Excuse me. You shouldn't leave your door unlocked. The lock's broken, but this pistol isn't. Didn't know this was your room. Sorta stumbled against the door. - I'm sleepy. - Well, then go to bed. Not too sleepy to see how different you look. Buckskin does a lot for you, but silk does more. Just that little bit of silk. Much, much more. I'm in no mood for visitors, Mr. Pentecost. I'd hate to have to shoot you to prove it. You're perfectly safe. Safe as if you're in your own room. I like that ribbon in your hair. Makes you look sweet and feminine. And pretty and feminine. Very smooth and feminine. You make a good hotel man, Owen. Just that nice personal touch to please our guest. - Hotel man? - I'm the new proprietor. - I won the place. - On a decision. I wish you a good night. Or a good morning, or a good afternoon or a good whatever it is. Jumbo's room. I'll have it fixed up for you. Move out all the little elephants. No sense in doing it now. You'd only see more of them. Well, if hair ribbons are your weakness, why didn't you say so? Rogers, come here. - Where's the head man? - He's comin". You call this Southern hospitality? The other night you seemed to prefer Yankee company. What brings you here? I've never seen $2 million in gold. Neither have we. Then let's look at it together. That two million in gold nuggets you've taken out of the ground. What gives you the notion that we have it? Heard it in a saloon back in Atlanta. And you believed it? Some drunk blabbin'. Why do you think I came all the way out here? Two million dollars in gold must be a pretty sight to set your eyes on. Maybe your hands, too. I'm no holdup man, I'm tryin' to help you. We don't need no help. Let him talk. He's from home. What part? North Carolina. Well, that's almost as good as Georgia. Go ahead. You're in trouble. Mining for three years. Had chances to get away with your gold. You waited too long. War is coming any day now. When it does, Yankee troops are gonna get in your way. You're stuck unless.. Unless what? What can you do? There's a big warehouse, belongs to the Circus Tent. Got lot of wagons there. Good strong ones, not broken down ones like yours. Plenty of guns, food, ammunition for the long trip back. - Will you show me that gold? - Why? I want $50,000 in advance for what's in my warehouse. You dirty renegade. Sellin' out your country. I'm sellin' out my wagons. In the most respectable, profiteering way imaginable. That money isn't ours to spend. It belongs to the South to fight the war. They can have the rest of it. I thought this was your way of showing loyalty to our cause. I thought you were a loyal man. Sure I'm loyal. I've got an undying loyalty to myself and to no one else. Nothing else. If you have any idea of shooting me, let me remind you that Jumbo Means is just waiting to get hold of the Circus Tent again. When he does, where are you gonna get your wagons or anything else? Waiting to hear from you. But think fast. - Where's Miss Boston? - Out in the warehouse. What's all this? An inventory. This is a list of everything you own. Looks very official. You even signed your name. Well, I guess ll belong on that list, too. Uh, I don't like owning things, certainly not people. Wouldn't want anyone to own me. Oh, all you want to own is money. Gambling money, drinking money. And maybe traveling money. Oh, I'm staying here a while. It takes two weeks to get your laundry back in this town. If you get restless feet, this oughta pay your way to China or Borneo or wherever you're going next. What are all these? Mining claims that Jumbo took in for half a ham or a keg of whisky. They're yours now. Any good? Some are, I guess. They haven't been worked much. - Why? - Lots of reasons. Folks run out of money, turn lazy, get discouraged. Let's encourage them. What this town needs is a good, old-fashioned revival meeting. - With you doing the preaching? - With me doing the preaching. I've an idea for a sermon that's sure to fetch them. The gospel of gold. Talking about gold really perks you up. What's wrong with likin' gold? Especially in the color of a woman's hair. I don't care about the color of a girl's hair. As long as she has a reasonable amount. I don't complain. There'll be drinks on the house when I'm through talking. Hooray for him. Now, let me tell you why ll invited you here today. You're all gamblers or you wouldn't be in Denver. So I'm introducing a new game everybody can play. North and South, friend or enemy. We've had enough of your gab. What's your game? I don't blame you for being suspicious, Mr. Jumbo. I wouldn't be at all surprised if some cheatin' might not have gone on right in this very room. That's why I'm moving this new game outside. It'll be the biggest gamblin' table ever. Reachin' for miles around. And big stakes. You can't lose, you might win. So listen to the lady. Mining claims. Take your choice. Gold in some, maybe all of them. Now who's gonna be dealt in? There ain't no more gold here. Your pals from Georgia got it all. There's plenty of gold left. Only it's not going to find you. You've got to dig it out. I ain't even got a shovel or a pick. He had to sell 'em and his wagon to buy grub for me and the kids. I'll stake any man who wants to work. And cash, too, to buy whatever he needs. Wagon, warm clothes, for himself and the kids. A new dress for his wife in that store that's opening just across the way. When anybody strikes gold.. ...I want half, and I'm gonna get half. No excuses, no hard luck stories. No double-crossing. Half is mine. Now, who'll be the first to sign up? Sign the paper and you get your money and your tools. - Give me one of them papers. - Don't do it. - He's a lyin', swindlin' rebel! - I don't care. I'm flat busted. This time I'll strike. I can feel it in my bones. He'll rob you blind. Him and that cheatin' woman of his. I know her like a book. You never got past the cover, elephant boy. What about you, Mr. Kirby? Doesn't seem natural, you not bein' interested in gold. Strikes me as peculiar, you never even talk about gold. Everybody in Denver does, except Father Murphy. Heaven's paved with gold. That's enough for him. But what about you? Well, if it's a secret, it's a secret. Pick out a good one for me, Pentecost. So now we're in the gold mining business. Chances are you'll end up with more lead than gold. You're nervous. You want to sell your percentage? Uh-uh. I'm hanging on to what I've got. Sentimental value. Owen. If there's a war, I'm North, a Yankee, you're South. What happens to us? I shoot you, I guess. Oh. Oh, good evening. Can't let Denver's fashion center open without celebrating the occasion. Only bottle of champagne in my warehouse. Bet it's the only one between here and San Francisco. That's very neighborly of you. You're a very special kind of neighbor. Uh, it's gettin' cold. Takes a little longer to chill it in spring water. You're a strange man, Mr. Pentecost. There are many things to admire in you. - Some to be afraid of. - Afraid of? What? Well.. ...I don't think you'd ever give yourself the worst of it. With man or woman. You know, Ann, you are something special. A lady. It's the first thing I noticed about you. It's born in you. I'm glad you're so positive about it. A beautiful lady high up on her pedestal. So out of reach. See how simple it is, Your Ladyship? I prefer to come down from a pedestal under my own power. When you do, I'd like to be around. That's the last of the stuff, Ann. You the first customer? No, just looking. Before you put me to work alongside of Kirby, I'll say good night, Ann, and best of luck. Enjoy the champagne, Kirby. You're angry, Stephen, but you have no reason to be. Hate to see another man taller in your eyes. You're imagining things. A new type for you. You're curious. When a woman's curiosity about a man is aroused-- There's no need for you to analyze my emotions. Maybe there is. Anyway, I, I have to leave now. Good night, Ann. Come in. Well. Sir, Captain Kirby reporting to Colonel Gibson. Forget the salutes, my boy, 'til we put our uniforms on again. How do you like secret service? Well, it's a change anyway, now I'm a gold miner. And I'm a writer. My wife says I couldn't have picked a worse disguise. She claims a writer should be depraved and romantic like Lord Byron. She wanted to come out to help me. - Is Mrs. Gibson coming, sir? - Good heavens, no. If Mrs. Gibson has a fault, which she's not prepared to admit, it's talking too much. Anything from, uh, Washington, sir? Nothing. The whole idea is crazy. We couldn't bring in troops. No, that'd be martial law and this is peace time. They still ordered us to stop that gold from getting South. If we don't, they'll shoot it back at us in the shape of cannonballs. I say start the war right now. Then we can move the troops in. Trouble is, Mr. Lincoln is too namby-pamby for his job. They say the man prays. He's a good Christian, ll suppose. I'm as good a Christian as any man, but praying's not gonna prevent this war. North and South are natural enemies like husband and wife. Oh, yes. That young lady you were with today. I hope she's not the inquisitive type. No, sir. She hired me as a guide at Fort Laramie. - Never asks me questions. - Hmm. Mighty few of those left. Nothing like a strong, silent woman. Must be caused by an accident at birth, wouldn't you say? Well, I suppose you want to be getting along. - Good night. - Good night, sir. Oh, yes. Don't mention what I said about Mr. Lincoln and his praying. I'm praying to be a general. - Good night, sir. - Good night. Your servant, ma"am? I'm afraid I'm in a hurry, Mr. Pentecost. Stephen is inviting me to see his mine. Our mine. He and I are partners. Nothing like picnic lunch with a pretty woman for a tired gold miner. Well, I'll tell him you said good appetite. Oh, I'm goin' that way myself, if you don't mind, that is. Got a lot of partners to see today. I get off here. Wish Kirby good luck. I have enough lunch for three, if you'd care to join us. So I won't be lonely? Thank you. You mind waiting a minute? Howdy. Glad to see ya. Hello, Lawford. How are things? Huh? Not very good, and that's a fact. All through for the day? I'd be wastin' my hard work and your money puttin' any more time in this claim. Maybe you're giving up too soon, Lawford. I ain't no greenhorn. I know when there's gold and when there ain't. Been prospectin' more than two years now. Wife and kid back in Michigan just about gave up on me. Hard to keep writin' 'em the next time's gonna be lucky. They plum ran out of patience. Dig those ashes out of that hole, Lawford. What for? There's nothin' in there. If there's nothin', I'll pay you for your time. Honest. I didn't make a strike. I'd swear by my kid's life. Then why did you cover up the hole? No special reason. What did you hit down there? White quartz? Is that what you didn't want me to see? Easy soft veins you can get at with a pick and shovel? - Come on. Dig. - I found it. Struck it over a week ago. I clawed gravel till my hands bled. What's mine is mine and you ain't gettin' any part of it. I got friends who wouldn't stand seein' me robbed by no secessh. We made a deal and you're sticking by it. You ain't collectin' nothin' from my claim. I'm sorry you had to see it. He reached for his gun. So did ll. And you won. Would you rather it had been the other way? I hate all killing. First thing to do is to get the body back to town. Get away from there, you buzzards. Keep your hands off. We brought him to you, Father. I don't know if he's one of yours. What does that matter? It matters that Lawford is lyin' here dead. All your prayin' ain't gonna change that. We got a way of dealin' with cold-blooded murder. Are you sure it's murder, Mr. Jumbo? That's a mighty fast verdict. You can't fast talk your way out of this. Hanging's too good for him. Needs a good whippin' with a big bullwhip that would lay his back wide open. I knew she'd cause you trouble. You had to go riding with miss high and mighty and look what happens. She's got her own man to do her killing for her. You're as bad as he is. Cheatin' trash, both of you. Be quiet. Have you no respect for the dead? Why be so quick to shed more blood? Bring him in the church. Look out, Owen. That's the only one I'm wasting. Try that again, there'll be more of you going to church. Before anyone else gets killed, let me tell you how it happened. I'll tell them. Self-defense is no crime. They'd never believe you. They'd try you and hang you the same day. I was with Owen Pentecost today. All day. We stopped by Jack Lawford's claim and.. ...and found him dead. Here, here, here. You keep out of it. You let 'em fight out fair and square. Stop them. Stop them. All right, that round lasted long enough. Now what's this all about? Kid got outta my coach when I turned around they're mixin' it up. - He started it. - I did not. I asked if he knew where I could find my father. And all I said was what's your old man's name, didn't I1? - Didn't I? - All right. As soon as I said Jack Lawford, you laughed and said he might be one of two places. Then all the other kids started laughing, too. That made me mad, so I started swingin'. Oh, you can't take a joke. - Your old man's dead. - That's enough. Don't you talk that way to my boy. Let's get away from here. He... he is dead, isn't he? Yes. But I want you to know you're with friends. What's your first name? Gary. Gary John Lawford. Middle name's after my father. Did you know him? Yes. H-how did it happen? Well, let's get settled first, and then we can talk. I'll take care of you. I live over there. He's coming with me. He'll stay with me. How can he stay with you? You, of all people. How could you face him day after day? Do you think that room and board is going to make it up to him? I'm handling this my own way. I didn't know about ol' Jack Lawford. He must've kicked the bucket since my last trip. Poor kid ain't got nobody now. Told me his ma died a spell back. Some friends put in, sent him out here. Well, I guess it's time for a drink. I'm an orphan, too. Get some soup, Phil, and some ham and eggs right away. Yes, sir. Soup's on the fire now. - Is that all right, Gary? - I guess so. This is all wrong, keeping him here with you and you know it. Or is this the way a gambler like you pays his debts? We'll make this a fine room for you, Gary. How did it happen? You can tell me. I won't cry. All right. He was killed in a gunfight. He did the best he knew how, but he.. ...ran up against something he couldn't beat. Who? Who was it? Who killed him? No one has found out yet, Gary. You better taste this, Gary. It'll make you feel better. I'm glad you're here. We're gonna be great friends, you and I. Don't be afraid to cry. Even big men cry sometimes. - Eatin' time. - Thanks, Phil. Say, Miss Boston, is this answer right? Well, let me take a look at it. Never make a mistake when I do that. Correct. How come you need all this learnin'? You're a rich, young fellow now, ownin' your pa's gold mine. Mr. Pentecost and I are partners. Just like him and my father. Owen's only got, but two of these. And now one of them's yours. Let's try it on. There. - Spittin' image of the boss. - That's right, Gary. Be like him. Just like 'im. Take it from someone who knows. ;) Jack Lawford's body lies rollin' in the grave I ;& Jack Lawford's body lies rollin' in the grave I ;& Jack Lawford's body lies rollin' in the grave I ;& Jack Lawford's body lies rollin' in the grave I ;& Jack Lawford's body lies rollin' in the grave I Don't bother with those boys, Gary. Wait until Owen gets home. I don't need him. I'll shut them up myself. Stop him, Phil, before he hurts somebody. Let him crack a couple of heads. I don't blame the kid. Hey, what's wrong with you? We ain't done nothing. What's the idea, ridin' down these poor boys? If you got anything to say, don't hide behind your kids. Sing it to me and sing it loud. Go ahead, I'm listening. Go on back, Gary. Concert's over. This is my fight, not yours. Milk's better for ya. You can have your bottle. I'm getting something better. You're all right. Learning fast. - Mad at me? - Yes. Well, no. You taught me how to ride. Now teach me about this. How do you get it out so fast? Give anybody first shot, but still always beat them. That's what everyone says. Teach me how to work a gun like you do. A little young for guns, aren't you? - You're just a boy, Gary. - Not if ll can shoot like a man. Then I'll find out who killed my father. Isn't that what you'd do? Yes, that's what I'd do. I'm sorry I was mad at you, even for a little while. - Let's get started. - Where? Your first lesson. Throw them as high as you can. Gosh! You didn't even look. I looked. I don't see how you did it so fast. If you're standing in front of me, you'd have never found out. I'll never be able to shoot like that. You wanted to learn, didn't you? If I teach you, you will. Let's try it over here. More shots. They're coming from over there. Now let's see you try it. Here, get used to the feel of it. What does he wanna do? Make that boy everything he is himself? Well, what is he? Outside of someone who seems to interest you no matter what he does. It's the boy I'm thinking of. Straighten your arm. - It's heavy. - But perfectly balanced. It sure is heavy. I'd like one I could handle. No gun is a toy. It's meant to kill with. I can teach you to hit what you aim at. But I can't teach you to kill what you shoot at. I'm not gonna preach to you one way or the other. Let's try it again. That's it. You're getting awfully worked up over a little shooting lesson. With his own gun that he's killed with. As far as I know, he's killed a couple of Indians who were trying to kill him. Anybody else? I don't know his record. I don't care to. But someone ought to teach him a lesson. Oh, I wish I were a man. Sometimes I think it'd be much easier for everyone concerned if you were. Come in, please. Thanks for inviting me over. I'm afraid this isn't a social occasion. What is it? A bargain sale? I saw you and Gary this afternoon. I can't drive it from my mind. You're teaching that boy to shoot. To kill. To be a gunfighter like yourself. You think I'm not bringing him up right, huh? Haven't you done enough to him murdering his father? So it's murder, now. - Next case. - What? The trial's over, Your Honor. You found me guilty. Goodbye. You're guilty more than you think. I'll tell you why you're training that boy to use-- I'll tell you. Because when the boy learns to shoot straight, he'll fill me full of lead and save me the trouble of committing suicide. Isn't that what you're thinking? It's on your mind or you wouldn't say it. If you have a conscience. Or at the last minute, will you be yourself and shoot the boy? You're quite a girl, Ann. Independent, think nothing of toting a load of pantalets and petticoats across the Rockies. A real pioneer lady. - Is that sarcasm? - Compliment. Well, don't be sure you can read everybody's mind. Or heart, too, for that matter. I can read Gary"s heart and mind all right. He loves you. Worships you. And then, one day, he'll find out the truth. I'll tell him when he's ready. And then how he'll hate you. And try to stop loving you until it... nearly drives him crazy. That's what loving and hating someone can do. Are we still talking about the boy? Or is that your feeling, too? Don't try to put words in my mouth. Why not? Aren't you proud of hating me? Just ashamed of nearly loving you. Never did much talkin' about love. You don't know the meaning of the word. You've got plenty of hate in you. Ll don't know how much love. More than you know, but not for you, not anymore. Nothing's over that fast. Killer like you, everything dies fast. I hate your hands on me. I hate the feel of you. Is that what makes your heart beat so fast? I never wanna see you again. I wanna forget I ever knew you. I'll make it easy for you. We're with you, Abe Lincoln. They won the first battle, but we'll win the war. Remember John Brown. Clean up Denver. Clean out the rebels. The only good rebel is a dead rebel. Let's wipe out the whole South. Remember John Brown. We'll blow the rebels smack off the map. Well, it's started. Fort Sumter surrendered. Won't last long. Be over in 90 days. The Yanks back East have no stomach for war. You don't need a stomach, you just need a law. And guns and money and Lincoln's got them. You ain't a Yankee sympathizer, are you? - Nope. - Well, that's somethin'. Them men paradin' outside are your enemies as well as ours. Well, they don't see us exactly like brothers tonight. Better wait here till it quiets down. Well, that's friendly of you. I knew you'd be on our side when the time came. We hold no grudges. You belong to us now. I don't belong to anyone except myself. I'm not joining any parade, yours or theirs. I like walking alone. No ties. No one to ask questions. No one to answer to. Man's gotta be sentimental to fight a war. Gotta have a lump in his throat about God and country and home and mother. All the pretty things. No lumps. What are you going to do? About the war? What any sensible man would do. Stay alive. Keep your paws off them guns, all of you. Now, Mr. Gunslinger Pentecost, we'll let you buy the drinks so we can wish a long life to President Lincoln and a quick hanging to Jeff Davis. Mister, you'll drink too. Or we'll pour it right down your gullet. And then we're gonna clean out your place. We ain't harmin' the woman if she keeps out of the way. Now unbuckle your gun belts and drop 'em. Maybe you'd rather take mine from me. You'd like that, wouldn't you? I can't think of nothing I'd rather do except to cut you down with your own lead. You shot your own man. The rest of you, get out of here before somebody else gets killed. Maybe it will be you. We still got you three-to-one. Maybe it'll be me. But, if anybody else wants to be sure of being alive tomorrow morning, now's your chance. - My man's in there. - So's mine. Don't worry, they missed me. Gary, put that gun away! Get away! I got him. I got him. Good. Now let's get the others. No, no! Stop it! - Bill? - Are you all right? I'll be... back on my feet in no time. Sure you will. Uh, it's not bad. Just a crease. Pretty close to the right place, though. See what happened to the doctor, Phil. Gary went to fetch him. Only a twinge. This is all right now. These Colts are exactly like mine. Only I ain't gettin' the same results. You know, seein' you standin' by our side down there against those Yanks was quite a comfort. The way it should be. Don't be carried away. I was just trying to save my own skin. That's all. Can't you see he doesn't feel like talking? Would you leave him alone? He's done enough for you. I've got you. Knocked the wind out of me for a while. I was too scared to cry downstairs. I... I thought I'd go crazy until I could see you breathing. When you opened your eyes and looked at me.. - I didn't mean to eavesdrop. Door was open, you know. Here's the doctor. Your very good health! Epidemic's got you too, eh? It's all my fault. Never would've been hit if he hadn't tried to stop me from shooting. I guess he didn't want a gun in your hand, Gary. The kid needs more lessons. That's all. I have to kick you ladies out. Gotta undress our friend here. Stay and help me, young feller. I'm kinda arm weary. I delivered two babies and took out six bullets tonight. - Good night. - Good night. I might as well tell you he'll get along better with one nurse than two. If you feel that way. I guess you got a good idea how I feel about him. Enough of an idea to know that you're in love with him. It's easy to tell, isn't it? Just looking at me looking at him.. ...and you know it. Yes. - Now, I hope you're satisfied. - Don't try to be so superior. I wasn't even trying. All right, miss high and mighty, I can throw low punches, too. You're crazy about him yourself. Only you don't know how to love a man. You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you? You wouldn't be happy unless you could change him all around. Turn him inside out, everything just so. Loving a man isn't always storybook pretty. But that doesn't stop you from loving him. No matter what he is or what he does. Can you do that? Can you? That's a one-way love. I'll give a man as much as you, everything. But it's got to work both ways. Yes, I love him. But I also... hate him. All right, men. To our friends. Excuse me, if it ain't Mr. Kirby. Never knowed you was a soldier. And a captain, too. Kinda had a feeling you might be army. Old-time sergeant like me's got a nose for gold braid. - Who thought this up? - We were mournin' our dead. We'd be proud to have you join us. Mourn your dead all you like. They don't rate these flags. We can't let you do that. Captain or no captain. These men weren't soldiers or heroes. They were killed in a barroom brawl, not a battle. If I'd been here it wouldn't have happened. We were fightin' to avenge Fort Sumter. We were licked there, too. Civilians aren't supposed to wear army caps. - Where'd you get them? - Ll issued them. Had them shipped in with the rifles. I've got friends back east, I want you to know. Powerful friends. I wouldn't care if you and the Secretary of War were kissing kin. You got no call belittlin' anyone's friends. You got kind of a suspicious friend yourself givin' aid and comfort and I don't know what else to the enemy. - You still a sergeant? - No. Ten-hut! Army regulations say sergeants are sacred but not ex-sergeants. Martial law has been declared as of now. Until the regulars arrive, I can use a hundred volunteers. Nobody in Denver carries guns unless he joins up. First thing you need is a quartermaster. Ammunitions, supplies, dry and wet-- You've got the job. Only I set the prices. Rest of us are going to keep order. And prevent contraband from going out. In case you don't know what contraband is, it's gold. - Rebel gold? - That's right. Just sol won't hit you again, I'm making you sergeant. - Top sergeant. - Don't know if I want the job. I'll take it. Kinda like them stripes on my arm. What do you know about soldierin'? Here, you, come on, you three over there. Fall in and make a double line. Double yourselves. Don't you know what double means? You had a hankerin' for war, now you'll get one. Get in that line before I take your ribs in with this. All right, stomachs in, chest out, feet at a 45-degree angle. Now you're lookin' a little bit like soldiers. Ten-hut! All present and accounted for, sir. Sergeant, as soon as we're finished here, post two sentries up at the Southerner's mines. Send good men who'll keep their eyes and ears open. Keep out of sight. Marv, that's for you and Toby. Right, sergeant. At ease. As soon as you take the oath, you can wear those army caps, carry guns, and rate flags on your coffins. Now, raise your right hands. Colonel Gibson, they got away, sir. Dirty secessh got away, gold and all. Poor Marv and Toby layin' at their post cold and dead at the hands of them hellhounds. Pull yourself together, man. You're making a military report, not delivering an obituary. Marv's relief was just coming up the trail. He's seen 'em. They got about 20 men. All with loaded saddlebags, loaded with gold. - They can't be far out of town. - They're still here. Headed for the warehouse behind the Circus Tent. The whole kit and caboodle. Nothing could be better. Got 'em all together. Now if only ll had my own men here. We don't need no help. Not as long as we're fighting for Abe Lincoln and John Brown. From what ll hear, you didn't do too well by them a few nights ago at Pentecost's Bar. We were tricked. So was Napoleon at Waterloo. All right, sergeant. Assemble your men, surround the warehouse. - I'll be over there directing. - Yes, sir. Kirby. I have a special job for you. Sir, request permission to stay here and be in on this fight with Pentecost. That sounds more like a private fight. Well, uh, it is, sir, but.. ...since our military objective is to put Pentecost out of action, I can promise you an enthusiastic job. Sorry, Kirby. Now, about these troopers on the way here from Fort Riley. They must think they're on a sightseeing trip. If you leave here at once, you should be able to meet them right here. I don't know how many of these fanatics I'll have left after we clear out that warehouse. So you take command of those troopers and hurry 'em up. Yes, sir. You hadn't oughta be out of bed, Mr. Pentecost. You ain't healed good yet. I saw you let them in the warehouse. - Saw it from my window. - Ah, don't you be mad at me. Don't be mad at them neither. They're in bad trouble. They want to see you. Go to bed. I'll handle 'em. You might as well know, I'm joinin' up with 'em. - Why? - 'Cause I'm from Arkansas. Like a couple of Mr. Rogers' men out there. Ain't sayin' ll hate the Yanks. I ain't ashamed to say some of 'em are my friends. But when my folks start shootin' at their folks, ll belong to home, shootin' alongside of them. Ain't that right, Mr. Pentecost? It's a choice every man has to make. Isn't always easy. The way I see it, a man can't turn his back on his own people. All men aren't alike, Phil. It's always hard to be different. That don't mean it's always right to be different, does it? Shucks, I don't know. I ain't got brains. I just do what comes natural. We heard Yank troops were on the way. Decided to get started before they arrive. How 'bout the wagons? There they are. Get your men busy loading them. We have some things to talk about first, don't we? I don't think so. One thing, we could use that gun of yours, and that luck, too. Yeah, and not forgetting your brains. You know it's not gonna be easy gettin' home. We're gonna have to be smart. A lot smarter than I know how to be. We're miners, not soldiers. We don't mind to fight, but we need a leader. A captain. And that's out of my line. All right, the sooner we get started, the better. - You go with us? - I said so. We're not askin' you to waste your time. We'll come straight out, pay you $10,000, including your guns. If you're hiring, my guns are worth more than that. Have a look. You think you can get past them and steer clear of Yankee troops, go ahead. My price is $100,000. It ain't our gold to give away. Every nugget's another cannon for the South. If you wasn't a Southerner yourself, we wouldn't have you along at any price. Sure, blood's thicker than water. Mine's more expensive. Owen! I'm leaving with Rogers and his men. - Tonight? - Yes. Why? What made you change your mind all of a sudden? Did someone play "Dixie?" Yes, someone did. What about me? You're taken care of. Circus Tent is yours, and all the gold in the safe is for you and Gary. I'm not talking about money and you know that. I cheated to get you, and I'm not letting you go. Take me with you, Owen. I'll do anything. I'll ride a mule, I'll wash, I'll cook. Don't leave me, Owen. Nobody else can go along, least of all a woman. They'll be fighting and killing. You wanna die, that's why you're going. Because of her. Because she's too nice, too sweet. I mind very much dying. It's not because of any woman. You'll forget me in a week. I'll remember you as long as I remember anything. What're you doing up in the middle of the night? Just been down to the warehouse, saddling up my horse. Ready to go? No, Gary. You're staying with Boston. You and she are partners now. No. You and I are partners... all the way. You told me that the first day I got here. You made the boy a small copy of you. And now you want to turn him loose. You can't walk out on people who love you. I'm a partner too... all the way. Every minute of all the way. You're not a Southerner, Gary. Neither is Boston. You wouldn't be welcome where I'm going with the rebels. Traitors. That's what they're calling us. If you're one, I wanna be one, too. You're a Northerner, like your father and your people. Well, my father is dead and you're the nearest thing I have to a father. Well, if he were alive, he'd want you to stand by and be on his side. Well, he's not alive. So I'm going with you. It's my fault he's not. I killed him. No, Owen. It isn't true, Gary. He ran up against something he couldn't beat and he lost. I didn't tell you it was me. Never had a chance. Call it murder if you want to. Now you know. Go after him. Help him get over it. Promise me you will. Owen... kiss me. Kiss me hard. - What do you want? - You looking for the boy? - Have you seen him? - He seemed anxious to get away. Anything wrong? Look, if you know where he is, tell me. If not, I haven't any time to be bothered with you. You're going to catch cold dressed like that. You must have seen which way he went. Yes. Yes, he's over at my place. What's he doing over there? Wait a minute. How does he happen to be in your place? No mystery. I saw him running to the corner. Guessed he was heading for your warehouse. Told him there was gonna be shooting. And no one was allowed in the street except the military. All right. He won't come out, not tonight. Why? He's got to come out. You tried locking me in a room once before and it didn't work. You're not fast enough on your feet. Too fat. I don't like being called that. Not by a woman. Not by you. You fool. You silly, fat fool. You lost me the Circus Tent. You lost me you. You never lost me because you never had me. You didn't try to fight him off. Well, he's not having you anymore. You're sick. Sick in your dirty diseased mind. Many is the time I wanted to come over and kill you when you were together. No! Jumbo, no! He's running away from me. He doesn't love me. Don't! Listen carefully in there. This is Colonel Gibson, United States Army. Any resistance will be hopeless. But I want to avoid bloodshed if possible. You will open those doors, come out, unarmed, hands above your heads. You'll be treated fairly and honorably as military prisoners. You have two minutes to make up your minds. Then I will lay siege to this building and, if necessary, burn it to the ground. Scrunch back. If they see you, they'll lock you up. That's what they did to some other people. - Gary, you shouldn't be here. - I have to watch. He's in here. A minute gone, a minute left. He got away. For a minute I wished he was dead. But... I don't know. I've marked on the map where Captain Kirby is meeting the cavalry troop. Just follow the trail. Yes, sir. One of us is sure to get through. Good. The rest's in Kirby's hands. Now, off you go. - Who goes there? - Sergeant Masterson. I got orders for Captain Kirby. I thought you want to keep a lookout until dawn. Didn't have to. Saw all I want. Cavalry, the other side of that hill, not more than two, three miles away. Get the wagons ready to go, fast. Too risky in the dark. It'll be sunup in about an hour. They'd be sure to hear us if we started rollin". I want them to hear us. Switch the gold around so I've got two empty wagons. Ross and I'll drive 'em right past their camp. You wait here, til you hear the cavalry chase us, then off you go that way. Suppose you don't fool 'em? Then you're in trouble. Come on, get busy. I want to get started before the Yankees are wide awake. They catch up with one of us and find the wagon empty, the other man saves hisself the best he can. Yep. If it happens to be you, then you'll find your $100,000 waitin' for you in Atlanta. You can deduct for the wagon and team I'm driving. I wanna feel free to treat it like it belongs to me. Do what I want with it. You're still workin' with us, aren't you? Yes, but I pay for what I get. I figure it's worth, let's see.. They're odd numbers. Make it an even $100,000. The whole $100,0007? You can't expect to pick up bargains out here in the wilds. You know, Owen, that's mighty generous of you. It just goes to show-- Shut up about it, before ll change my mind. Get the men mounted. Carry 'em out, boys. Two men take care of him! Take six men, sergeant. Go after that wagon. It's probably empty too, but ll wanna make sure. Rest of you men, fan out over that hill. That other fellow's back there somewhere. Oh, I didn't know it was you ll was following in here. Where's Rogers and the other wagons? They won't get far. There's only one way to go. Southeast. And I can travel twice as fast as they can. There's more than one way out. You'll never catch them now, and you know it. You've lost, Kirby. I've been looking forward to seeing you alone. I've often wondered if I could shoot a man in cold blood. Knowing you, the betting'd be ten-to-one against. Of course, you can't play form on a man with a gun if he's riled up enough. I'm riled up enough, and you know why. You're too much of a professional soldier to take a war that personally, so it must be a woman. Don't be so light-hearted about it. You've been after Ann from the start. But I thought everything was open and above board. But when Masterson blurted out in the saloon that you and she-- There was never anything like that, Kirby. Ann's not for me, I'm not for her. Maybe I might have thought different once, but not anymore. It's easy to talk. Twice as easy to lie. Don't I know it. I guess this is a time to, uh, tell the truth. Tell it to myself as much as to you. There are two people in the whole world I need and want. One of them I can't ever have. Gary. The other one is not Ann. - Boston? - Yes. Since you're going back to Denver and I'm not, tell her.. Love is a word that never came easy to me, Kirby. But it does now. Tell her that. Can you walk four miles? The stagecoach for Santa Fe passes by over that way. It might be hot walking. What'll it be? Colonel Pentecost of the Confederate Army? Just plain Private. So, a salute's coming to you, captain. We've lost him. No use wasting any more time around here.
