(suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) - How many tickets we sell tonight? - Only 18, maybe we'll do better as a movie theater. (clattering) (thunder cracking) (operatic singing) - Where's Ellen? She was supposed to be filming the play tonight. - I think she's somewhere backstage. (operatic singing) - I really think you should tell your boyfriend that there's nothing between the two of you anymore. - Why should I? He still buys me at expensive restaurants. (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) What's going on? - Something must be on fire. (coughing) (screaming) (clattering) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - What did you do in there? (screaming) (thunder cracking) (screaming) (thunder cracking) (glass smashing) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) - [Announcer] At Spotlite Theatres you can always expect prompt and courteous service. (clattering) (laughs) - Of course it was easy to get. I just asked a studio to send me a preview print so I can videotape it off the screen. They get the film back and I get two bills of copy. What? - Your meeting downstairs, it's intermission. - Alright hold on. (projector whirring) - [Announcer] Welcome to Spotlite Theatres, your ticket to escape. - I think I'm going to leave early again today. - [Announcer] Welcome to Spotlite Theatres. - [Selina] So I want you to punch out my timecard for me when you leave later. - [Announcer] Where the popcorn is always popping. Welcome. - Where's everybody going? - Leave the folder but take the slides. Pick it up, out of the way. (clattering) (door whooshing) - Glad you all could make it here. In one minute you'll all know the purpose of this special meeting. You'll be happy to know that... just a minute. I thought I told you which employees I wanted to speak with. And what about those two in the second row? - [Miss Blackwell] I didn't ask them here. - Then get rid of them. - Selena, Darcy this is a private meeting and it really doesn't concern you. There's a more urgent meeting for you upstairs. - What other meeting? - One with a broom and a dustpan. - I can tell that this is an important meeting and I'm sure that it concerns me. - I'm sure it does. It's about employees who have been stealing money from the concession stand. - Let's go. - Well you said you wanted to leave early today anyway. - As I was saying, you'll be happy to know that the Spotlite Theater chain has just added its 11th theater. - [Adrian] Congratulations. - Actually the congratulations can be extended to the three of you. I'm transferring you all there as new employees. Adrian, you'll be the manager of this new theater. I picked you because of your experience as a projectionist. You'll be able to do both jobs there. Malcolm will assist you. And of course Jennifer, who you obviously know from other than the theater. - How many screens does this place have? Are you sure we'll be able to run it ourselves? - That's where this theater's different. 'Cause at first it's not being opened as a multiplex. All our money is still tied up in twinning the theater we bought. - Oh you mean the one where they put the standup screen at the edge of the balcony and call it a separate theater? - It worked for a while. - Until the audience upstairs threw the screen over onto the people downstairs. (laughing) - Let me show you what the place looks like. The slideshow. Here's the theater from the outside. - Who took the slide? - This sort of package came with the building. - How come there's no name on the marquee? - The next slide is of... what are you doing? Why didn't you show the rest of them? - That's all there are. - No, there was a whole bunch from the inside that I was looking at this morning. - Well they're none now. - Here's the best part, I'm offering a $1,000 bonus if you can pull off a successful opening night, between the three of you. I want to see something good come from all this. Here's the address, you can go look at the place now. It should be open. You're going to have to do the cleaning yourself and I want to see the theater open as soon as possible. (door whooshing) - [Announcer] Remember your ticket is good for only one showing. - I don't know if we should trust Murdock or not. - Why are you always trying to make me look bad? Why didn't you show the rest of the slides? - Because the rest of the slides have chalk outlines on the floor. - Well, aren't you gonna help me carry all this stuff back upstairs? - You can bring the circus back to the tent yourself. - [Announcer] Spotlite Theatres, 10 locations conveniently located throughout the Greater San Fernando Valley. Intermission is now over. Return to your seats immediately and remember we don't care the movie next door sounds better no switching theater. In theater one we are proud to present Chainsaw Chicks. In theater two Amputee Hunger. In theater three The Clown Whores of Hollywood. - Selena, you know the rules here about smoking. - Rules are made to be broken. (laughing) - You know you guys aren't gonna see us around here anymore. - Why? Is it a new requirement to have an IQ over 50 to work here? - No, you're still here. (laughing) - [Together] Oh no! - [Announcer] Show times at 1:30, eight o'clock and 10:10. Late shows every Friday and Saturday night. - Stop looking at me like that. I don't know why you're suddenly so damn disapproving, at least there were no second thoughts. What? Oh back so soon. - [Adrian] Who's having second thoughts? - Nobody on this end. - [Adrian] We want our promise of $1,000 in writing. - I suppose you want it and triplicate too. - No, one will be fine. Oh I see you found the rest of the slides. - No, these are just the slides from Miss Blackwell's last vacation. - Where was your vacation to? - Oh, it's nothing worth speaking of. It won't even compared to the all expense paid trip I'm taking this weekend, thanks to the gratuitousness of our employer. Unless of course you want to see these? - That won't be necessary, they're already long overdue. - [Announcer] Welcome to Spotlite Theatres, where there's always showmanship in the show. Intermission is now beginning, be sure to visit our concession stand. - A free vacation, what makes you think you deserve that? - Consider it my payment for not saying anything. - Why? You're paid already for not doing anything. - I know. (groans) (door rattling) (suspenseful music) - This is the college I plan to attend in the fall. - You're so lucky Jennifer. - Yeah, you've got everything going for you. (whistle blowing) - [Together] Ready, okay. So come and shout, our team is what it's all about. So stomp and shout and show yourself. Don't mess with us, our team is tough. We're the team with all the moves. So look at us and start to groove. We party, so hardy, so we'll all party with you. (brakes squeal) - There he is! - Oh my God. (brakes squealing) - I'll bet someone's gonna notice. - Shut up. - [Announcer] Remember, when visiting Spotlite Theatres free parking is always available at the motels located conveniently across the streets. - Did you notice they're closing down that motel across the street? - You mean the one with all the whores? (siren blaring) - Don't feel bad, maybe you can buy the place and turn it into the Spotlite 20 Complex. - What was that? Would you stop her? - Hey- - [M r. Murdock] What do you call this? - The new look for the Spotlite Theater chain. - What happened to your other pants? - Well I sort of had an accident with them. - What's the matter? Couldn't get them off in time to turn a quick 20? - You should talk. At least I'm adding class to this theater. - Listen jail bait, you couldn't add class to the corners around it. - Selena. Selena, are those the only pants that you have? - Well I can always take them off. - Get to work in those, but stay behind the counter. And I want to see you in polyester tomorrow. - I'll bet you do. - I'll bet you do. (glass smashes) (vacuum whirring) (thudding) - Would you stop playing games? (vacuum whirring) (door squeaks) - I'm not playing games. I fell down. - You fell down. You wanna tell it to Gordon, he's trying to hide from me. - It was an accident. (clattering) (electricity crackling) What happened? (door creaking) (phone clicking) - [Announcer] Spotlite Theatres wishes to disassociate itself with the motel located across the street. Please park your cars elsewhere. (phone ringing) - Spotlite Theatres, where you're the star. - Could I speak with Mr. Murdock? - Hold on. - [Film Actress] Oh my God, who brought the chainsaw to the club? (chainsaw revving) (door whooshes) - Great going, now I have to start all over again. - There's someone on the phone for you. - Well next time take a message. Stop the film, rewind to reel one, we have to start all over again. Murdock here. - It's Adrian. Now we're having trouble with the power and we can't find any fuses. - Adrian fuses are quarter apiece, is that what you called me for? - Well, yeah. - Well, why don't you go to the store and buy some? - Will you pay us back for them? - I'll reimburse you for anything that keeps you happy. - What did he say? - Well-- - That was a wasted call. - No, at least we have an expense account now. Hey, we better get back to work now. - Well I'm going to work upstairs, if you don't mind. (vacuum whirring) The trash bags. Malcolm! Could you bring me up. Who's doing that? Adrian, I want you to tell Malcolm to stop teasing me. - What's he doing? - He's trying to scare me by turning on all these lights while I was on the balcony. - What? - I want you to stop bothering me. - I didn't bother you, I've been here vacuuming. - Just because I heard the vacuum doesn't mean you couldn't have been off somewhere else. - Can't you two stop arguing so we can get some work done? - Well I see you've been getting plenty done. - Oh, I've had enough. Let's go, we can finish here tomorrow. - Are you sure this is where Jennifer works now? - That's what she said this morning. I wander if she's here yet? - Jennifer! I guess not. - Maybe she doesn't start working until tonight? - We can wait. One, two, tell me who are you? - Hey, maybe the concession stands open. - Yeah. One, two. (suspenseful music) Who the hell are you? (screams) - Dee Dee? Dee Dee? Dee Dee? Dee Dee? (screaming) - It's was great idea to come back to the old theater for a date. - Yeah, especially since everything's free. - [Announcer] Welcome to Spotlite Theatres where you're the star. - Jennifer there is a great make out film in theater number three. (magical music) - Hi I'm Dean Murdock, owner of Spotlite Theatres. I'd like to invite you to our concession stand where the popcorn is always popping. (sighs) - [Announcer] The popcorn is ready. - Wait what size did you want? (popcorn popping) Wait you can't be out already. Wait, slow down. - So this our concession stand where there's always something good to eat. - Eat me. - Selena where were you? There was a whole crowd here a minute ago. - Well there's no one here now. Can you believe that? They probably got in for nothing and then they take free popcorn. - We can't even do that. - What colossal nerve, I'll show them. - Selena. - [Announcer] The popcorn is ready. (popcorn popping) (door whooshing) And now previews of our coming attractions. - No Selena, don't do it. - Do it Selena, do it. - [Announcer] Now showing in theater three. (projectors whirring) Introducing Bo and Zo, alias clown whores of Hollywood. (brakes squeal) (horn honks) - [Man] They should be run out of town. - [Man] They're a disgrace to Hollywood. - [Women Together] They're giving us whores a bad name. - They've got to be stopped. (brakes squeal) - Adrian. - Oh Adrian. - What are you doing? - The same thing you would have been doing in a few minutes Jennifer. You're a pretty cheap date. What would you be doing if Adrian had paid for that popcorn? Taking advantage of things that regular employees here don't even get. And I'll tell you what else is wrong. - How about sitting down? - Hey how about shutting up? (people shouting distantly) - [Cinema Goer] Lady cut it out. - [Selena] Oh cut it out yourself. - [Jennifer] Would you shut up? - [Selena] Shut you up you whore. - [Announcer] Be quiet. - [Selena] Be quiet. - [Announcer] Be quiet. - [Selena] Why don't you just die alright? - [Announcer] Be quiet! - [Selena] Take it off like your mother takes it off. - [Cinema Goer] Shut up lady. Why don't you just go home? Why don't you just leave? - [Selena] Shut up, I am the next feature. - Lady will you sit down? - What did you say? - I said sit down. - I thought that's what you said. (groans) Don't complain you'll get your money worth. Is this enough butter for you? Here, eat some of this backwards. - What's going on in there? People are complaining in theater two. - [Announcer] There's action, laughs and sex. (whistling) - Sit down. - Damn this bitch. - [Announcer] Thee Clown Whores of Hollywood coming soon to your city. - [Announcer] And now our feature presentation. (audience applauding) - Won't you leave other people alone? - Don't ever touch me again. - Don't tell me what to do. I know how to deal with our employees. - I'm not your employee, bitch. (growling) - Bye Jennifer. - See you later Jennifer bye. - [Announcer] Thank you for visiting Spotlite Theatres, where your visit seems like it never ends. - We got another file on that theater today. - Well what does it say? - Nothing new. At least there are no pictures in it. - Well, then put it with the other ones. - I wonder what they're doing over there right now? - I don't care as long as it's not gonna cost me money. - These plants were just delivered, did you order them? - Yeah, I thought they'd look good upstairs. - And who's paying for all this? - Murdock, he said he'd cover everything. - This place must have been beautiful when it first opened. I almost wish I could have been there. (door creaking) (suspenseful music) - This is really lucky, it's full of all these old films. (suspenseful music) (projector whirs) Would you be careful? (projector whirring) - You know this must be what that camera on the balcony was used for. - What camera? - There's a camera on the balcony. It must have been used to photograph plays off the stage. - Do you know that if it wasn't for persistence of vision we wouldn't even be able to watch movies. - [Jennifer] That's the theater we're in right now. (fire crackling) (reels whooshing) (groans) (suspenseful music) (screams) (glass smashes) (phone ringing) - I just called to see how things are going. Any trouble so far? - Ah, no Mr. Murdock. Everything so far has been fine. - What do you mean everything's fine? - Are you sure everything's okay? - Things are fine, but I've got to go. - Still nothing. I wish I had time to go over there. - Why don't you? - I have to get ready for the convention tomorrow. - Why are you going to another one of those? - Because I can make more there in a day than I can here in a month. - Are you crazy? I was almost strangled and you say everything's fine? - You were almost strangled? I don't see a thing. - Well maybe next time, I'll ask him to stab me instead. - Him? - Yes, it was an old man. - Hmm, you've never had trouble with old men before. - Why don't you believe me? And why did you lie to Murdock? - Because I happen to think $1,000 is a good enough reason. Now what happened to you after the film burned? - It all happened so fast. I was going down the stairs and I felt this wind and then that old man came out. - That explains everything. - What does it explain? - Well it was windy, one of the exit doors must have been open and someone else got in here. (gasps) See and whoever it was already left. - Adrian I am not going back up those stairs. - You won't have to, you can run the ticket booth and the snack bar. Malcolm and I can do everything upstairs. I want you to promise that you won't say a word to Murdock about this. - I don't know. - Promise. - Okay, I'll open the theater. But I'm not staying here to work on it. I'll be back opening night and that's it. - [Woman] Jennifer. - What are you guys doing here? - Murdock gave us the address. Here's the stuff from your locker. - Why aren't you in uniform? Aren't you working? - No, no I don't think this theater will ever be open. Um, just give those things to Adrian, he's still in the office. There's something I have to do. - Sure. - Oh and if Adrian offers to give you a tour of the theater, don't take it. - Selena, what are you doing? - Applying makeup over my bruise. - But you don't have a bruise? - I will when I'm finished. - I'm beginning to think that maybe we sent in the wrong team. - What do you mean? - We would like to request a work transfer, to one of your other theaters. - What is the reason for this request? - [Selena] Employee violence. - And what's your reason? - Fear of future employee violence. - Well, it so happens I have an opening for two at another theater. You can start tomorrow. - That'll be just fine. - You know Selena, there's something I could tell you right now that would make your life so much simpler. - What? - I'll tell you some other time. - Here's the address. You're now official employees. (suspenseful music) (laughing) Aren't you worried? She could have filed complaint after you bruised her like that. - I'm not worried. I slapped the other side of her face. - I'm gonna work on an ad for opening night. You can leave now, I'll lock up when I'm through. (thunder cracking) (eerie music) - [Jennifer Voiceover] How can you check on the theater when you don't even know its name? - Yeah, opening night is this Saturday. No seven o'clock would be fine. (typewriting clicking) (thunder cracking) - I can't believe this is a Spotlite Theatre. (doors creaking) I thought Jennifer said this theater wasn't open. - She did. (eerie music) - I can't see the door we came in from. - Wait a second, I have a flashlight. (clattering) - Lisa. Lisa. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (rain thudding) (fire crackling) (groaning) (screaming) (popcorn popping) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) - How are you going to manage to get into that convention? - I've arranged to do a seminar on my chain of multiplex theaters. At least I won't have to pay admission like last year. - What if someone from the theater should call? - Don't worry I'll be back soon enough. Just take all my messages for me. (groaning) Since this is a convention, at least I'll be able to get something there that I can't get here. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (fire crackles) (door rattling) (upbeat music) - What kind of joke is this? - This can't be the right place. - What are you doing here? - Murdock transferred us here as employees. - Oh great. - What kind of a theater is this? Where are the four screens? - What's going on? - Meet our new employees. - What? - It's Murdock's idea. - [Selena] This theater doesn't even look like it's open for business. - [Adrian] It's not, we're still working on it. - I'm not lifting a finger to clean this place. - Yes you are because I'm the manager. - Well let's see you manage to keep us here. - What are you doing here? - We're new employees. - And whose idea was that? - It was all Adrian's idea. - Adrian? - And we've been getting along just splendidly. That is until now. (plant whooshing) (screams) - I am barely out of here and you call those two. - Where did that come from? - I didn't call them, Murdock sent them over. - Look, there's more of them. - And why would he send them here? - Hey, how did that plant fall? - It's just one of many added attraction to this theater. If you stay a little longer you may get to see the feature presentation. - Are you working here or not? - Yeah we're working here. - Well I may not be Mr. Murdock and I'm not Adrian, but if you want to work here, you better get your asses in gear. - What's the matter? - Adrian, why didn't you pick me up after school? I had to take the bus over here. What if someone had seen me? - Jennifer I-- - Oh get your hands off me. - That's it'? Now maybe we can find some glue. - What's going on here? - Just getting a little work done. Didn't you say you wanted to finish on the projection booth today? - Yeah. - I wouldn't work in a place like this unless I knew more about it. - What did we do to deserve to be sent to this pit? Do you realize we could control this whole building with just a few turns? We know move to the next stage of the operation. (suspenseful music) - [Together] Wow! - [Selena] I'm going to leave I want you to cover for me. - [Darcy] I don't know Selena it's not like when there were four different theaters in one building. I could always say you were in one of them. - Are the lights out in here too? (phone buzzing) (phone clicks) - [Announcer] Remember smoking is not permitted in Spotlite Theatres, this means you. (phone ringing) - Spotlite Theatres. - Could I speak with Mr. Murdock? It's about two of his employees. - Uh, Mr. Murdock is at a convention. Do you want to leave a message? - Well. do you know when he'll be returning? - Uh, no but I can tell you in a minute. Oh, uh huh. Um, actually Mr. Murdock may be returning sooner than I thought. The convention was yesterday. (doors whooshing) (suspenseful music) (screams) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - Help! (screams) (doors slamming) - No, Mr. Murdock is not in yet. I know he was supposed to have returned yesterday but he hasn't. (phone ringing) Spotlite Theatres. I don't care if you're sick, you have to come in tonight. We're out of employees. I mean right now. (phone beeps) Hello? (suspenseful music) - [Announcer] Be sure to cast your ballot for employee of the month. The ballot box is located in the lobby. - Wasn't Murdock supposed to be here? How else is he going to know if we had a successful opening night? Well maybe that's him now or at least Selena and Darcy. - Is this where the opening is tonight? - Yeah this is it. - Whose idea was this? - Must be one of Adrian's ideas. - Has Darcy been here today? - Why bitch? Was she's supposed to come and clean the slime out of your locker? - Listen to me, is she here or not? - No she's not but you are. How about coming in here and running this booth? - Why? I'm not your employee anymore. (suspenseful music) - That's our cue, we go on in 10 seconds. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. We're coming to you live on our opening night or should we say our grand reopening. Since its construction in the 1930's this building has been continually opened and closed. Will success smile on the theater or will it stand empty and crumbling in a short matter of time? - I haven't been able to find Darcy all day. I don't think she ever left here last night. - You're hours late. - Or could it fall a victim to progress and become a four screen multiplex? - But she never left here. - You're out of uniform, you're late and you're not going to ruin my opening night. - The fanfare is about to begin or should I say the final curtain call. Jamie Hart, Channel Three News. Cut, okay let's get out of here. (phone clicking) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Is your boss in? - No, the asshole isn't here. (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) (thunder cracking) (groaning) (electrical buzzing) (electrical buzzing) (metal grating) - Wait, I think someone's coming to let me out. (door rattling) Something's wrong out there. - Listen Selena. Remember there was something I wanted to tell you before? - Yes. - Every time that theaters been open, someone's been killed in it. (door rattling) (screaming) (screams) (thunder cracking) (suspenseful music) - Adrian? Adrian? (groaning) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (knife squelches) (doors whooshing) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - [Operator] Operator. - [Announcer] Welcome to Spotlite Theatres. Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. - Have you heard anything yet? Has the case been solved? Well did I get the money yet or not? Have you've been speaking with them at the other theater or not? - [Announcer] No waiting. Four screens. - Oh I've speaking with them all right. - Well, what happened? I want to know exactly what it was like when you talked with them. - [Announcer] No waiting. Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. (screams) Four screens, no waiting. Four screens, no waiting. (siren blaring) (suspenseful music)
