Taking Steps Forward One step at a time, Moving forward steadily, On that familiar path. Though sometimes lost, In that season, I keep on moving, On the road where sunlight peeks through leaves. I journey alone, And then we become two, In that unforgettable season, I... Mr, Mr Hisada? Are you there? Sorry. Anyway, that girl's weight loss video went viral. Now she's releasing a book, First print run, 50,000 copies. Do you want me to ghostwrite it again? Your writing is simple and easy to follow, It lets readers read smoothly. Are you saying my writing is unremarkable? Not at all. You could make a million in income, What do you think? Just take it easy and write. Actually, I'm thinking of writing a new book, Is it another pure literary work? It won't sell. Hello? Sorry, I haven't received this month's payment. I've been busy with meetings at the publishing house, and I haven't had the chance to send it. I'll give it to you on Sunday. Alright. Smells great, really looking forward to it. Tell her on my behalf, I'm excited too. Even the fish fins are spread out. It was clearly supposed to be to see dolphins. How did you end up buying jellyfish? Because it's so cute. I heard that dolphins can drown while sleeping. They can drown? Yeah. Indeed, Nagasaki's sea is more beautiful. She wants to go again. Yes, after all, the last time we went was for grandpa's funeral. Yeah. Mom. Look, dad bought this for me. That's really nice. Alright, let's head home. Bye, dad. See you next time. - What's this? - jellyfish Jellyfish? Really, it's a jellyfish. - Its tentacles are very small. - It has tentacles? So adorable. What about dolphins? Didn't you buy dolphin? (Miso-boiled bonito) (Every time I see canned bonito) Every time I... See canned bonito, it reminds me of a certain boy. I think no matter how old I live to be, I won't forget that summer. "SABAKAN" (1986, summer) I thought this worn-out bicycle Couldn't possibly be fixed. But with dad's skillful hands, The bicycle came back to life as if by magic. Dad was just wearing an undershirt and underwear at home this morning, Mom scolded him. But I like how carefree dad is. The teacher was deeply moved. Hisada. Yes. I'm very moved. I think everyone must be very moved. Applause as encouragement. (Class 5-2) On the eve of the change from the Shōwa to Heisei era, I was still an elementary school student. Minoru was really cute. every day with friends Back then, every day I would laugh heartily with my friends over things that had no nutritional value. Recently, I tried the gachapon for Kinnikuman wrestling figures, but I ended up getting Kinkotsuman twice. In our class, there's a student who marches to the beat of their own drum, Takemoto. You see that guy, he only has two sets of clothes. He's been wearing the same outfit all year round. Tomorrow it's definitely going to be green. He uses spit as an eraser, always drawing pictures of fish on his desk. However, one day, a small incident happened. Look, as expected, he's wearing green today. That guy indeed only has two sets of clothes of different colors. listen to me, my older sister said she wanted to play the piano, so our parents bought her one. She's really stubborn, you know. Wow, impressive... Hey, Take. If you put a piano in your house, won't the floor collapse? Don't be stupid. Putting a piano won't cause any problems. You're lying. Why would I lie to you, idiot? Then, let's all go visit Takemoto's house together. Rock-paper-scissors. Great! Hurry up and get it, grab it! Wait a moment. Hold on. How much longer do we have to walk? Perhaps he really doesn't want us to see his house. To escape from us, Takemoto circled around the same block three times. Didn't we pass by here just now? Follow me. Stop kidding around. Brother. So dirty and messy. It's really run-down. That one looks like an eye, right? Really, huh? So the other one is the mouth then? It's basically a face, isn't it? Just like the house of Kinnikuman. Really dirty and messy. It's filthy enough. - The window is even broken. - Really? It's seriously shabby. Let's tell everyone at school tomorrow. Great idea. Let's go, Hisada. Let's go. Good morning, Hisada. Good morning. Good morning. Everyone, look over here. A kick might make it collapse. Despite being ridiculed by everyone, Takemoto continues to draw fish on his desk as usual. His profile looks tougher than Jackie Chan's. I'm back. Welcome back. Go wash your hands first. Mom becomes the scariest person in all of Nagasaki once she gets angry. I've personally seen her deliver a powerful kick to Dad's sensitive area. What are you doing? Homework. You're really silly. Come on, welcome back. I have some sweets. Did you wash your hands? I did. stop lying. I said I washed them. Brother, not washing your hands properly will make you sick. - You're so noisy. - What are you up to? What am I doing? You dummy. Dabao, after you finish your snack, can you go to Yuuai Supermarket and buy tofu? What? I just got home. I want to go too. Quit complaining. When I ask you to go, you go. I want to go too. You're so noisy. Don't hit him. Here, take this. I want to go too. Wait for me. I want to go too. I want to go too. (Yuuai Supermarket, Chouyofun Branch) Please let me get Buffalo Man. Oh God, please, make it Buffalo Man. Please, give me Buffalo Man. Kinkotsuman again? My dad gives me only a measly ten yen for a half-hour shoulder massage. He's a huge fan of Yuki Saeto. Yuki… She's really cute. Alright, it's been half an hour. Really? Really, give me the money quickly. Here you go. Great, thanks. Dad. What's up? What should you do if you find 100 yen? Should you take it to the police station? Why take it to the police station? It's the person who lost the money who's silly. (Telescope, 10,800 yen) Hisada Takaaki. Here. Last day of the semester. Will we welcome the summer vacation with joy or enter into a hellish life? Hirosue Hiroki. Everything depends on the semester report cards. What's going on? What's wrong again? Stop touching your private parts all the time. Is it not normal to do so? Don't touch your private parts. Touching them is normal, right? Forget it, look for yourself. Your language arts grade is good. Look at social studies, here, needs improvement. Math and science are also... What does it matter? As long as your language arts grade is good. How can you say that? No wonder you can't make much money. Money? What does that have to do with money? Your summer bonus is only 20,000 yen and beer vouchers. I can't believe it. - Kids are listening, you know. - Beer vouchers... - Don't talk about these things in front of kids. - Beer vouchers are useless. Go exchange them for white rice for me. Everyone outside can hear you arguing. Stop bringing that up. Cousin sister is always so gentle. Ako, do you have a boyfriend? Uncle, asking about this will make young people dislike you. Right? They will dislike it. So noisy. Be careful, I might cut off your little brother, you brat. Scary. And Mom says if you don't lose weight, you'll die young. Elder sister is so naggy. She's right, look at this belly. Ouch. Such strong sibling bonds. You guys really get along well. Ako, how's work been lately? Getting used to it mostly. But standing all day makes my heels ache. I'll come visit you next time. I really want to see how you work at Himaya. By the way, this is for Keita. Thank you, sister. Sorry, always making you spend money. This is for you. Thank you, sister. There are your favorite songs inside. Heavy metal, right? Isn't it expensive? - Don't worry about it. - Wow, that's great. Yuki, look closely, Yuki. So noisy. A burning pain in my chest, Am I such a sad girl? Don't be sad, Yuki. (Summer Vacation) Focus on your homework. This is so difficult. It's because you always give up so easily. Brother, you can't give up easily. Shut up, you little brat. So noisy. Here. hello, wait for me. Dabao, your friend is here. Don't call me that way. Got it. We shouldn't call you Dabao in front of friends, right? Dabao. Please, stop saying that. Got it, Dabao... Just stop saying it. Where's brother? I don't know. Dabao? (Iwabuki Shrine) So stubborn. Hisada. What important matter do you have to tell me? Hisada, promise me first. The matter I'm going to talk about later, You absolutely can't tell anyone else. Cross your heart, liar's gotta swallow a thousand needles. Hisada might get poked with a scrub brush. Out of your mouth, then poked on the butt again. Is it a deal, then? Have you heard of Boomerang Island? Boomerang Island… It's the island beyond Tick-Tock Rock in the sea, right? You can see it from there. See what? - Dolphins. - Dolphins? Are you serious? Who told you that? A delinquent boy. The dolphins swam to Boomerang Island. Really? The delinquent boy must be right. Great, then let's go see it together. What? Go see... go see dolphins? No, that's impossible. Boomerang Island is in the Seto Inland Sea, right? You have to cross Tick-Tock Rock to get there. If we cross there and come back, it'll already be nighttime. I have to be home by five o'clock. Hisada, you have a bicycle, right? The two of us can ride there together. We'll be back by five. But riding double on a bicycle will get us scolded. Don't you want to see it? Don't want to see dolphins? Who knows... maybe we could even ride on a dolphin's back. Hurry up and get on. If we write an essay about it... We might even get praised. The story about the dolphins is really fascinating. Thank you... But still... I probably won't be able to. I see. Oh, by the way, What did you do with the hundred yen you picked up in front of the bookstore? Hundred yen? What did you do with it? I... I really... turned it in to the police... Are you deciding whether to go see dolphins or to go to jail? Choose one. Do you want soy sauce? I really want to eat regular sushi. stop talking in your sleep. With your 20,000 yen prize money and beer coupons, you won't get to eat any. Don't you want to give it a try? You like sushi, don't you? You like sushi, right? If you're not eating, give it to me. Ouch, that hurts. - Laughing my butt off - Ouch, that hurts. Ouch, that hurts. Watch me crush your balls. That's going too far. Leaving at five in the morning the next day, I left home while my family was still asleep For the first time, I went on a trip without telling my family. I don't know why, but my excitement far outweighed my unease. Dolphins had such a strong allure. Let's go. What's the rope for? The reins. We'll need them to ride the dolphins, won't we? You must be an idiot. Get on. You're in charge of riding. How's it going? Not much. Hey. Where are you guys going? who are you? Takemoto. Kids aren't supposed to ride double on bicycles. Where are you going? Is it far? Wait here for me. Don't you dare run away. How's that? Your butt won't hurt like this. If you sit like that for a long time, Your butt will split open. Split open on both sides. Hurry up and laugh. Alright, while mom's still asleep, go quickly. Go on, hurry. By the way, Here. Use it to buy drinks. Takeda. I'm Takemoto. I see, you better get along well with Takaaki. Pedal. Pedal hard. Charge! Like this. Our little adventure began. We're heading to Boomerang Island, Gotta cross the mountain known as Tick-Tock Rock. We have to take this path? What's that? Borrowed it from my dad. Wait... I can't push it up myself. Do we really have to take this path? Quit your complaining, just push hard. I'm already pushing. On our journey, we witnessed the changing seasons And shared our happy and sad moments, And shared our happy and sad moments, Little by little. Get on the bike, - Let's go to the beach. - Take a break. Encountering the gentle breeze brushing against our cheeks, Riding the bike into the forest, Meeting the blooming little flowers, Riding the bike, stepping forward to you. What's wrong? The dam is crying. After three hours away from home, We finally reached near the top of Tick-Tock Rock. Don't lie down, you won't be able to stand up. Here. Have some water. Don't drink too much at once, you might get a side ache. You're such an idiot. So beautiful. Where's the beauty? Come with me. Why are you showing off? Wait for me a bit. (Top of Tick-Tock Rock) So beautiful... How's that? This view is beautiful, right? Sounds like you're the only one who's seen it. Get on. - This is my bicycle. - Get on. Let's go then. Hisada. - Hisada. - what? Shout it out loudly. Shout it out. Louder, once again. Louder this time. Danger, hit the brakes quickly. What should we do on the return journey... A boatwill straighten itself when it reaches the bridgehead. (Kusaki Store) Hey. Hurry over. - I'm telling you. - how's it going? You stole something, didn't you? No way. Too bad, I saw everything. It's chewing gum, right? You stole chewing gum. At your age, you're into chewing gum. I'll count to three, and you spit out the chewing gum. Three, two, one. Alright, we're taking you to the police station. Did you steal something? Who stole something? You must have stolen something. You're so annoying. Mind your own business, you old fart. And you, you chatty old lady. Watch out, I'll beat you both up. What's with your attitude? Clean up your language when you talk, you brat. Did she just call me an old lady? It's okay if she calls you an old fart. I'm okay with that? Alright. - Where are you going? - Toilet. Then where are you headed next? The other side of Tonomoura Port. Did you steal something? Did you steal something? No way, you old hag. Look, this bicycle is so beat-up. How are you supposed to ride it? Hey! You little brat! Is that bike yours? Why is it pink? What's it to you? Are you a sissy? No, I'm not... I think you're actually a girl. I'm a guy. Well... Show me your bird, huh? Show what? Yeah, show everyone your bird! - Come on, show it! - Show us your bird! You've got five seconds to take off your pants. If you don't, I'll beat you up. Alright, five, four, three, two... Hurry up! What are you doing? What's this little brat up to? I'll just... You little brat! Hold on there! You little brat! - Ouch, it hurts! - Let go... Quick, run! Run, hurry! You better run! Ouch, it hurts... They're gone. Ouch, it hurts... My, uh, "eggs"... disappeared. Disappeared? Where did they disappear to? Um... Thank you. Clumsy fool. Boomerang Island? We're here. wait... wait for me... Are we swimming across? Obviously. If you jump in like that, you'll get stung by jellyfish. What happens if you get stung? You'll die. Take it. Wait. Hold on. Wait for me. wait for me Hold on, I'm coming. If you don't swim faster, the dolphins will leave. Hold on. (Boomerang Island) Just as they were about to reach at Boomerang Island... Save me! My foot... I've got a cramp. Come over here. I can't. Don't give up. i can't do it. Don't give up! The one who saved me... It's the older sister we saw at the bus stop earlier. Are you okay? You jumped in without warming up, right? No wonder you got a cramp. How was that girl? Alright, let's go find the dolphins. Could you let me rest for a bit? Where are the dolphins? Dolphins? Okay, let's split up and search. You search over there, and I'll search here. Like this. Wait, I don't want to go alone. Wait, I don't want to be by myself. Dolphins! Dolphins... they're not here. We searched for a whole hour. But there's no sign of the dolphins at all. Couldn't find them anywhere. Alright, let's go back. We're leaving boomerang Island. Swimming back to the shore again. When we reached the beach where we started from, we encountered that person again. Eat up. It's so delicious. Here. What's this? Nothing. What's this? Let me see. Yucheng Soda… A Korean drink. Korean? Is it from a foreign country? Yes. Way, way on the other side. Where is it? If you're curious, go take a look. I'm not interested. Big sister, have you been there? I… Haven't been. Is the bicycle parked over there yours? Yes. You won't be able to ride back like that. Right. Wait here for me. Sorry, I lost your other shoe. My dad said dolphins might drown while sleeping. But we still didn't see any dolphins. There's nothing we can do about that. Let me ask you... Why did you come find me? Because I had a bicycle? Because back then, you didn't make fun of me. You didn't make fun of my family. What's wrong? Take this! You, you... Maybe from the start, there weren't any dolphins at all. Perhaps he just wanted company for his journey. Seeing his face as he threw sand at me with a smile, I secretly thought that way in my heart. You really are good at drawing. Alright. This way, no matter who comes, we won't have to worry. Yeah. Both of you, come here. Alright, change into dry clothes and let's get in the car. When we arrived at the town where we were living, it was already evening. Is this where you get off? Yes, well... Thank you. Goodbye. Excuse me… What? May I ask what your name is? I'm called Yuka. Yuka. You're really obsessed with breasts, huh? No way, it's not like that, really... You little brat. what? Hang in there. Hisada. Hisada. See you next time. See you next time. Take care, Take. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. Since returning from the trip to Boomerang Island, we spent the summer vacation together. We even went fishing together. It was Take who taught me how to fish. At that time, it felt like as long as we were together, we could handle anything. Watch out for wild boar droppings there. You know that well, Take. After all, this place is like my backyard. Take is quite knowledgeable about the ocean, rivers, and mountains. - Hurry up! - That was close. How to identify delicious mountain vegetables and avoid poisonous mushrooms - he taught me all that. What's that? is this okay? Oranges naturally grow in the mountains. Picking these oranges to sell is like being a thief in the mountains. Oranges don't belong to anyone. Pick as much as you want. Hey! Take has an arch-enemy. Take... You never learn, do you? Uchida, the old stinker. Uchida, the old stinker? You little brat... - Quick, run! - Wait! Take! Take! Don't just stand there. Only a ghost would listen. Stop right there. Stand up, run! don't make that face. Just do it. do what? Start moving your feet and run! Wait a moment. I'm so tired. Hisada, you really lack perseverance. Don't give up until the very end. I haven't given up. You won't catch me that easily. This mountain belongs to me. You old coot. Who did you call an old coot? I think you need a lesson. Next time, I'll definitely escape successfully. Are you okay, Take? I'm fine. Hisada, do you like sushi? I do, but I can't afford it. It's too expensive. Do you want to come to my house tomorrow? Take? Take? Take? Come in. Find a seat anywhere. Move over. Told you to move aside. (Miso boiled Skipjack Tuna) Dig in. What's this? Canned skipjack tuna sushi. It's delicious. Really? Yes, really, it's amazingly good. My dad taught me how to make it. I see. My dad used to be a fisherman. Your dad is so handsome. Totally different from my old man. Your dad is handsome too. Where's the handsome part? He just scratch balls all day. Take, why don't you become a sushi chef? Actually... I really want to be a sushi chef. That's great! I'll definitely support you. So are you going to be a writer? me? Nah, I can't do that. You can. Really? Told you to move aside. Um... Do you guys want to join us? Eating together would be even better, right? Sure. Great, come on. I'm back. - Welcome back. - Mom's home. It's so hot... What are you all doing? - Mom, welcome back. - What are you all doing? I'm back. - What's going on? - Welcome back. Is it your friend? You must be Hisada, right? Yes. Thank you for taking care of No problem. Sorry, the house is a mess. Make yourself at home, no need to be formal. Mom, what's for dinner today? We're having curry tonight. Sounds awesome. Mom, will you be home today? Sorry, Mom still has work to do tonight. - Come and help, quick. - Alright. (August 31) Right there. Guest, your shoulders are so tense. Right there, feels amazing. Can't catch up... Dabao, can you help Mom with something? Can't, I'm doing homework. Who told you to play every day? Come on. Go quickly. hurry up. Go buy tofu and Napa cabbage. - What about Mont Blanc? - Not needed. And tofu...over there. Hisada. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, I didn't properly host you last time. No problem. Sorry, thinking about that day makes me laugh. Let me tell you, after you left that day, that kid got really angry with me. Take? Wasn't I asking if you were his friend? Right. He's upset because of that. He said he doesn't know if you consider him a friend. I'm not allowed to assume things. He's afraid you don't want to be friends with him at all. He's always having trouble making friends. But it's also my fault for always asking him to take care of his siblings. But please, get along with him in the future. Come over to the house again, okay? Be careful on your way back. Hearing Take's thoughts, I felt a sense of loss and an odd kind of anger. Dabao. Sis... You went to You'ai Supermarket too? I heard from Auntie. You made new friends, right? You guys play together every day, don't you? It's not like we're friends. The that guy doesn't see me as a friend at all. Hisada, good morning. Good morning. And then, as summer vacation came to an end, the new school term began. You're really amazing. Truly impressive. Hisada's book review that he wrote during the summer got chosen to participate in the county competition. Hisada, you're incredible, well done. Applause from everyone. Hisada, you're really something, huh? I turned around, and the principal looked like he was about to faint from happiness. Ninomiya, say something to congratulate him. Hisada, do you want to go back together? I have to go somewhere else today. Hisada. - Let's go get gachapon toys. I want to go too. Then I'm off to work. Be careful on the way... Mom, I want to eat cupcake. I see. Don't daydream, those things are too expensive. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. What happened? Nothing. Mom, aren't you running late? Oh right, thank you. Mom's leaving now. Be careful on the road. Bye. (Youai Supermarket) You're almost off work, right? Yes. - Good job. - You too. Great job. 300 yen... (half price) It's not expired yet... It's nothing. Has Dad ever kissed you? Of course. It's because of those kisses that we had you guys. Right? Ryoko? Have you kissed? When? Right? Yoshiko, want a kiss? Ew, gross. - Want a kiss? - Ew. You secretly want one, don't you? I want to kiss you... mwah... Guy, it's time to sleep. Hey? Don't get too close. (Half price) Takemoto has to transfer schools because of something. It happened suddenly. We didn't even have time to bid farewell to him. It's really unfortunate. There will be a safety awareness lecture next week. Let's review traffic safety together again. Understood? Yes... Her kids will be taken care of by relatives. They're forced to separate. Yeah. It's really sad. Aren't they going to school? I heard they're moving away before the graduation ceremony. Guys, we're leaving. Let's go. Let's go. I'll contact you guys again. Got it. We're leaving. We're leaving too, it's time. Hey, where are you going? Hey. (Long bridge) Friends... We're good friends. I know. I deliberately chose sour oranges that can't be sold. Really dumb. Let's go. Take. Goodbye. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. Good boy. These oranges are really sweet. They're indeed very sweet. For those things we want to forget, and that unavoidable loneliness... Um... Aren't bicycles not meant for two people? It's fine, I'm an adult. Drink, drink, get me drunk. Drink, drink, get me really drunk. Drink until I fall asleep, in the end, men quietly drift off. Hey. Mom, they're back. Don't cry in front of your mom, okay? I know. Don't be like this, it's embarrassing. It's okay to do it occasionally. Me too. Then let me hug you. What's wrong with you? Are you still a baby? it hurts… Ako, eat more. - This is really tasty. - Why did you take so much? Quit the chatter. Why are you taking from there? We have it here. No, I can't. These chicken nuggets won't run away. They might escape into that guy's stomach. I can't stand it, it's so noisy. Eat quietly. When are you going to kiss? When should we kiss? So annoying. Kissed yesterday. Really? Did you really kiss? We kissed, we kissed. So annoying, don't make noise. After a very long time. Take, now a grown adult. He really became a sushi master in Nagasaki. Even though I haven't been there yet. But I heard he have a special sushi in their shop. (Canned Mackerel Sushi) That's the Canned Mackerel Sushi. He told me with a smile on the other end of the phone. Customers say it's not good. I heard they gather once a year as a family. Here he come. Give me a ride to the station. Sure. Your book smells nice. She said she wants to go to Nagasaki. if you don't mind, Should the three of us go together? I'll think about it. Whenever I see canned mackerel, I think of a that boy. Hisada. Take.. that boy... We haven't seen each other in decades, right? And yet... We're still good friends. (After the ending song, there are more exciting scenes) What are you doing right now? Are you looking at the same scenery as me? Looking at the sky dyed orange, And the sunset that will eventually turn into dawn. Whether it's tearful nights facing each other Or days filled with silly conversations and laughter until morning, They are all the treasures that support me till now, Unforgettable treasures. Even if we're separated by distance, I can still feel your tenderness. So no matter where we are, We're not alone. No matter what we face, We won't give up.
