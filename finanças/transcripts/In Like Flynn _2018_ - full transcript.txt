Oh, Schwartz, you are gonna love this footage. Wow. One bite from that, the final minutes of life will be your worst. Stay close, lads. Where the hell did you find this kid? He was the only schmuck who answered the ad. Really? Tabura! What are you doing? Oh, that was big. Okay, stop it. So, uh, Flynn? It's been about an hour since the last time you said we were gonna be there any minute, so how much further, please? We'll know when we get there, won't we? Gun. Brilliant. Gun. Get this. It's a warning. Stay here! Tabura. Get a nice close-up. On second thought, stay with me. Careful, sport. Who's the lucky stiff? He was a prospector. I'm guessing his prospects aren't lookin' so hot, huh? Savages did this? Taking gold from the island is like stealing blood from the gods. I know the feeling. I got two ex-wives. Oh, Schwartz! Yeah? This guy's still warm. What is that? What is he saying to you? Stay close, lads. They're watching us right now. What? Where? Tell 'em to come out. I'll charm their pants off. That won't be necessary, Schwartz. Okay. Come on, come on! I'm trying! Just give me a sec! Give me it! Hot damn. Oh, my God. Run! For the love of God, keep rolling, keep rolling! Tabura! Tabura. Help! Help! Puk puk! Puk puk! What's he saying? Get me back to the studios. Come on! Film it. What? Film it! It's brilliant! Come on. Come on! Get away! Come on! Tabura! Flynn! Mr. Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Come on! Are you happy now, Schwartz? Hell of a gin mill you got here, Flynn. You're all right, you know that? He's better than all right. You, sir, are an honest-to-God son of a bitch. To you. Good hooch. He's a headliner, and he doesn't even know it. Well, kiddo, you got us back safe as agreed, so that's yours. Thanks. What, he doesn't even count it, huh? That's a man with confidence. I like that quality in an individual. I'm sorry about the boy. That was... Yeah. It was bad luck. All right? We're gonna immortalize him for you. Anyways, you find yourself out in Hollywood, kid, you give us a call because we can use a guy like you, doesn't need to walk a flight of stairs with a stuntman. Well, I'm afraid civilization no longer agrees with me. Oh, really? You don't think I didn't notice that little glint in your eye? There's nothin' like a little bit of gold dust to spur on a man's wild goose chase, huh? I'll be seein' ya, kid. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come here! Come on! Yeah! Hell of a fight. I've had better. Well, I'll be goddamned. Never thought I'd see Errol Flynn roaming these streets again. Good fight, mate. What, that's it? It is what it is, Rexie. I have something that may be of interest to you. Say we discuss it over a pint. On me. I taught you everything you know, kid. Think I don't know a scam when I hear it? Not this time, Rex. The sirens of the sea beckon. Spare me your bullshit, Flynn. You're a goddamn pirate. Ladies. You wanna squabble by my table, it'll cost you some quid or cost you your lives. Now beat it before I set Big Jim on ya. Just deal the cards, Frankie. Only one calls me that is my mother. Last man calling me that found himself with his tongue cut out, shoved full up his ass. Now I know folks love a good tongue up the ass, don't they, love? So long as it ain't their own. I'll take your money. Deal the cards. You see, I've just come back from New Guinea. Took some Hollywood bigwig up the Sepik River to get some background footage for his pansy actors. You've never been up the Sepik. I have now. And I'll tell you something. It's lined with gold. Cards are gettin' cold, Yank. I'm Canadian. Well, whoopsy-fucking-do. I'll raise you so, Canadian. He's in. Gimme one. You see, every fool with a shovel is scrambling for a piece. Man and woman. Wealth and women? Well, that doesn't sound like Errol Flynn. All in. It's all right. He's good for it. You got balls, Rex. Now pay up if you want to keep 'em. Just give me a break here. I could pay you tomorrow... Jimmy, this son of a bitch thinks I'm stupid. Easy. Tender flesh cuts up nice. How much does he owe? Three large. Three large? That's an expensive friend. Half! Half's not bad. You know what it is men fear the most, Rex? Reputation. The kind you get for killing a man in cold blood. But a man's infamy is only as strong as what he does to keep it. What do you think happens to that reputation if I cut you a break? People might think I've gone soft. Can't have that now, can we? We can work it out. We'll work it out, all right. Now let me widen that grin of yours! Frank, the money! Rex. So New Guinea, how are we getting there? Leave it with me. I've got an idea. Flynn, this is my kinda place. Mm, welcome home. Hello. Oh, what do we have here? Some tea for you? Behave yourself. How is your tea? Oh, um... Lovely. Tasty. You two don't belong here. What brings you? Well, Miss, uh... Achun. Achun. Ravishing name. We're interested in purchasing a boat I hear you're quite interested in selling. Well, you've heard wrong, Mr... Flynn. Rex. We don't need anything fancy. Old one moored out front, perhaps? I could offer you... a hundred? No, thanks, old sport. I don't care much for business complicated by formality, Mr. Flynn. A man's sincerity is revealed when his mind is free of the need to lie. Who are you? I don't know anymore. You're a mirage. A painting... personified to haunt my dreams. Do you know what I do with men like you? Uh-uh. I own them... until they no longer serve a purpose, at which point, I derive pleasure from watching them suffer. Well... I'm perfectly willing to be your property, but... if pain's your bag, then he's your man. Huh? Oh, where am I? Well, this, my fine man, is the Sirocco. I'm captain, and you're first mate. I feel like I've been sucking on a sheep all night. Well, she was a lot of things, but by no means a sheep. Come on. We have work to do. What happened? Rotten amnesia, eh? Well, seeing as Achun refused to sell us this boat, you volunteered as decoy. Ooh! For what? Well, for me to steal it, of course. You robbed the Chinese pirates? We robbed the Chinese pirates. And you used me as a goddamn decoy. Now they're gonna chop us up into fish bait. Cheer up. Nothing like death to fuel ambition. Besides, seeing as I've been relieved of most of my cash, I didn't have much choice, now, did I? Ow! Ahoy there! Permission to board, Captain Flynn? Oh, you didn't. Oh, but I did. Permission granted. How are you, Adams? How are you, Flynn? I say, I've got the maps, I've got the sextant, I've got the compass, I've got... Hey! What, are you bringing Flynn his laundry? Still the beam of sunshine, eh, Rex? Look at those lines. They don't make 'em like this anymore. You seriously invited the Dook? Dook? Yeah. With that pompous Duke of Wellington accent of yours. Well, if you must know, Flynn invited me to join the voyage. Navigates better than a sextant. Besides, the boy's a crack shot. Crack shot, my ass. Well, go on, shoot his ass. Where'd you learn how to handle a gun? At school, of course. But aren't you studying to be a teacher? Could teach you a thing or two. Shoot the tick off an elephant's ass. Shall we? Yes, we shall. Let her fly. Lucky shot. Amazing that one still works. At least until more people realize the French put holes in their coins. Good to have you aboard, Dook. Not you too. Well, like a fine suit, that title fits. Oh, disgusting! Bloody god-awful Chinese tea! Take note, chaps, and embrace this, this moment, who we are this instant, because we will never be these men again. Jesus, Flynn. Just pass the bottle. This is a moment, Rex. Enjoy it. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. You know what you're looking at there, princess? Of course. In theory. Theory? I've read everything ever published about sailing. How many voyages have you actually navigated? I'm proud to say this will be my first. Good God. We're gonna die. Bloody hell! Stop right there! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop right... Oh, my God almighty! Good morning, ladies. Good morning, ladies all. This isn't what I signed up for, Flynn. You said it was going to be fun. Great start, Flynn. Oh, this is ridiculous. Now... what are you pricks doing on my boat? This is our boat. Rubbish. She's mine. And I lost her to a pirate wench. Well, we acquired her fair and square. The only thing a man acquires from Achun is a severed jugular. Now tell me how you got her, or I'll cut the three of you like tuna. Can we discuss this like gentlemen? I'm Trelawney Adams, and this is Errol and Rex. My name's Charlie, Your Majesty. And I don't give a crap. Now some truth! All right, all right. You see, we... we stole it. We're headed to New Guinea to claim a fortune in gold! Dook! I'm sorry! What do you landlubbers know about sailing the Coral Sea? She'd swallow you whole and spit you back out! Even if you somehow managed to navigate the razor-sharp reefs of the Barrier, you've gotta pass through cyclones that'll blow your bloody foreskins off. No! The only way the Sirocco goes anywhere is with me aboard. She responds to my touch. Well, then come with us. Are you mad? We'll give you equal share. Are you completely mad? You think I give a wallaby's nutsack about your gold, mate? I just came for my boat. Well, then she's all yours. If you help us get to New Guinea. Flynn! Why should I sail with a bunch of thieving sissies? When I could just kill ya, hmm? Because you wouldn't be on this boat if it wasn't for us. And because I see she means a lot to you. And Lord knows we could use the expertise. Come with us. You'll have a heading to sail and a chance to blow this wretched hole and get rich in the process. It's only one voyage away. What do you say, Charlie? You did fix her up nice. Thank you. When do we leave? You're not gonna kill us? You want me to change my mind? No, no, no, no. One condition. I captain this voyage. At least until you drown. Come on, lads. Let's go find some gold. Bloody mad. Can you guys untie me? Orders, Captain? Full speed ahead! Full speed ahead! He still stinks of whiskey. Then he'll fit right in. He could cut our throats as we sleep. He wouldn't do that, would you now, Charlie? 'Course not, Captain. Besides, best to slit a man's throat when he's awake. Quicker heart rate. Bleeds out faster. ♪ Away you roll ♪ ♪ In South Australia, I was born ♪ ♪ Heave away, haul away ♪ ♪ In South Australia, round Cape Horn ♪ ♪ We're bound for South Australia ♪ ♪ Haul away, you'll hear me sing ♪ ♪ Heave away, haul away ♪ ♪ Haul away, you rolling kings ♪ ♪ We're bound for South Australia ♪ Ready. All right, men. Three, two, one! Spot of insomnia? Never was much one for sleep. Here. Cheers. Cheers. What's the real reason you didn't kill us, Charlie? I'm no more a murderer than you are, sailor boy. And by the looks of you lot, won't be long before you get yourselves dead, and I get my boat back. How's a man like you go from owning to losing to working a ship like this? With all this retching going on, it's impossible to get any shuteye. I was just asking Charlie how he came upon the Sirocco. Well... She belonged to a French fisherman. We used her in the war to move wounded from the Somme. After Armistice, I offered to buy her from him. He gave me the boat, but he made me promise to take his daughter with me, give her a better life. She was... We traveled the world together, she and I. Nowhere we couldn't go. We fell in love. Even raised a child on these very boards. But she grew tired of the ocean. Said I spent more time on deck than I did on her. She was right. She wanted to settle. Stay put. But I couldn't. I longed for the sea. So I let her go. I was in the South China Sea when Achun found me. Threw me overboard. Wasn't for a fishing trawler, I would've made my bed with Poseidon. Followed that Chinese bitch all the way to Old Sydney Town. That's when I found you blokes. It's true? You survived the Great War? I was lucky. She's a damn good ship, Charlie. Just like you. Been through hell and pushing for heaven. I'm at my beam's end, mate. Just trying to stay afloat. Skint. Now what? This is serious, Flynn. Ain't much worse way to go than starving to death. No one's dying, lads. All right, leave it with me. My compliments to the chef. See if we can go rustle up something else. Wonderful spot. Perfect place to die. You got a lot of years left in you, Charlie. Maybe I should follow in your footsteps. What? No family to weigh you down. Nothing on your back but a stiff ocean breeze. You're free. Free? You need to hoist your sail a little higher, mate. You're a good lad. Don't want to wind up like the likes of me. Find your own horizon. Take more than a few fish to keep us going. You're their captain. Their lives are in your hands. I think we'll make it just fine. I believe ya. Careful with that. It's a predatory gastropod. What? Venom affects your nervous system. Oh. Right. Son of a professor. Maybe you retire here, Charlie. Blow it up your ass, mate. Hey, we got some visitors. Hello, girls! Hoo-hoo! Whoa! Lovely. Oh, that's good luck, you know. You boys thinking what I'm thinking? Why am I nervous? We are eating porpoise tonight. What are you doing? Fishing. It's bad luck! For the dolphin. Dook's right, mate. You just take that and put that downstairs, right? I'm still hungry. You'll doom us all! No, just you! Rex. Dook's right. Rex! No! The next will find your ass. What, you're gonna shoot me over a fish? That mammal has more goodness in its dorsal fin than you'll ever have! Even with a gun, you're still a pansy. And you're a bully. So what? What are you gonna do about it, crack shot? I guess you'd better do something. Jack Reginald Gough, the Third! What? You bastard! Jack Reginald Gough, the Third. That's Rex's real name. Your real name is Jack Gough? You can't be serious. It's French, and it's pronounced "Go," and damn you, Flynn! And that stays on the boat. Do you guys hear me? On the boat! I'll take "Dook" any day. In fact, I don't even feel sick anymore. Look, you guys, I wasn't gonna shoot the dolphin. So why don't you just put down the... You hit the engine! Dook, hold her steady! Where's it coming from? She's missing a bloody bolt! Got bigger problems. We've got a hole this big. Let me see! Oh, bloody hell Charlie, where's the pump? By the stairs! We need to take care of his hand! No, don't! You need warm water on it. Don't move. Get it in here. Keep it in there, boy! Charlie, I've got a second pump. All right. Dook, get down here! Oh, my goodness. Take over. Think, Charlie, think. Think! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Quick, get me something heavy! Hurry! Right, in there! That'll do it. Oh, I'm too old for this. If it's not one thing... Don't! Stop! The rag! It'll... ...get caught up in the prop. Jesus. A rag. That's not a dolphin. That's a bloody shark! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Hey! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Stop! You might hit Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Errol! Flynn! Errol! Flynn! Flynn! Errol! Flynn! Errol! Oh, my Lord. Did I miss something? Thank the heavens. You son of a bitch. What? Nothing to concern yourself with. Let's go have a look at the pump. Having fun yet? Will she hold? Tight as a nut. You all right? You were right, Charlie. On the island. Their lives are in my hands. You're doing okey-kokey, kid. Blown engine, hole in the hull, Rex's hand. Well... You see, that is the thing about horizons. There's always a new one. Aye. Aye. Welcome to Townsville! A little whiffy at the moment. You'll get used to it. Yeah, business been a little bit slow of late. And you are? Christian Travers, Harbor Master. And as of last election, Mayor. I'm also the local priest, if you've got a bit of confessing to do. Quite the résumé. Oh, too right. Oh, this is my son Rudolph. He's the heir to the local throne, aren't ya? Are you a boxer? Look like you can handle yourself. I don't condone violence. Where's the liquor? Well, that's one thing we're never short of here. Look, if you boys need anything, I mean anything at all, anything, just come to me. I'm at the Northerner, up on Main Street. I'm there every day. Every day, I'm there. Every day I'm there. Every day, except for Sunday. That's when I'm at church. That's also up on Main Street. Yeah. Well, I don't know if we'll be here that long. You see, she needs some... Engine. Some engine work and a patch job on the hull, then we'll be on our way. Oh, we've got a great engine man here. He's a great engine man. He's up on the south side. Yeah, he'll fix you right up, yeah. All right, well, you boys have a look around. There's quite the bustle in town at the moment. We're a fine modern city we are here, with all the needs you'll be, um, you'll be... needing. We'll keep that in mind. Yeah, good on ya. All righty, well, we'll see you Sunday, yeah? Yep. God bless you all. Let me know if you change your mind. To the Sirocco. May she live to be a seaworthy vessel. To you, mate. Thank God it weren't your wanking hand. A pint, sir. How old are you? What do you mean, how old am I? It's all right. He's with us. All right. Thanks, old chap. What's this then? Name's Johnson. Errol Flynn. This here's Dook, Charlie, and Rex. Nearest zoo's in Brisbane, fella. So what's an outfit like yours in Townsville for? We're on vacation. We blew an engine. We need supplies. We're headed to New Guinea. Don't tell me you bastards are looking for gold. The mere scent of it drives men to wretchedness. Our mayor, for instance, he'd extort shit from a dunny if he thought it could earn him a quid. My old man worked himself to death paying off what he owed that son of a bitch. But his day's coming, yes, sir. Anyway, no subject more fascinating for a scribe than the vain pursuit of capitalism. You're a writer? Journo, Townsville Bulletin. Oh, really? What section do you handle? Politics, mainly. Hello. Like a moth to a flame. Excuse me, sir. Anything the lady wants. Get scarce, mate. Well, I don't see a ring, old boy. Not that that stopped me before. Fair game, as far as I'm concerned. No worries, bruv. Watching her for my cousin. Oh, my Lord. Hello. You're gonna suffer. It's all right, it's all right. I've got this. Told you this weren't a good idea. I've fought bigger. One moment. Pint? Oh, my. We can't just sit here. We have to do something. Such as? I suppose you would like a blind captain because his eyes are about to pop out of his head. Oh, my God. Watch your stern there, Captain! That's gotta hurt. He'll be all right. Come on! Come on, Flynn! Whoa! Bet you weren't expecting that, ya crook! Oh, wow. I've fought bigger! I thought you were done! I have fought bigger. I believe ya. Many wouldn't. Hell of a wallop you handed Travers' prizefighter. That was brilliant. David and Goliath. Lucky punch. Wait, his prizefighter? He runs an underground fight club every Friday. Big money. That legal? Ish. But he's the mayor! And priest. Local boxing promoter too. That sounds very tiring. Hedonism on Friday, confesses to himself on Sunday, he's square by Monday. That does not sound good. Hello, ladies. It's for a good time. Where did you get that? Oh, my Lord! Wasn't going to give the razors everything I have now, was I? You blokes better get your priorities straight. We're gonna need that there for the boat. You put that back in your pocket. I'll take care of this. It'll be my pleasure. Let's go! You're not coming, Charlie? The only warmth this body needs tonight is coming out of a bottle, mate. Go. You have some fun. Just watch yourself. Let's go. Oh, hello. Oh, God, hello. I say. It's as close to heaven as we'll find, lads. Errol. Rose. You scumbag. Well, I... Well played. Can I join in? Rex. Still hanging with the likes of this loser? He makes me feel better about myself. Oh, delicate. You fishing for scoops, Johnson? You got one? We might have a murder soon, after what he did to The Mountain. Indeed. In Townsville, word spreads faster than legs in this bathhouse. Are you here for anything other than selfish pursuits? Most selfish. Let's get you cleaned up. Zaca can take care of your mates. What sort of bathhouse is this? The good kind. How much for the whole damn package? I guess you'll find out. Look, darling, there's one. Oh, there's one. Evening. Evening. We'll look tomorrow, darling, when there's more light. We are not seeking men. We are seeking rats. I know rats. Hide in the shadows and the cracks, stealing to live. You have to think like a rat to find them and kill them. Then find them! I will. I can smell them. You've been through the wringer. You know me, Rose. I have a genius for living. It's the consequences I'm not so versed in. Well, you deserve every last bruise. I had to leave. Yeah, that's what they all say. I should cut your throat. Police were on my tail. What was I to do? Yeah, well, they found me. They tried to book me as your accomplice, but they didn't have any proof, so they let me loose. Then I caught a boat, hoping to find you. I followed all your crumbs, stories of your antics up the coast. This was as close as I could get to New Guinea. Figured you'd wind up here sooner or later. I didn't know. You always were a bullshit peddler. You painted a pretty picture of life in the tropics, just you and I. And I'm the fool who bought it. Well, it could still be, you know. You and I. Errol. Yes? I can't. You see, I got here without a shilling. Travers took a shine to me, and I figured I'd use that to find his stash. I didn't get far until his thugs caught up with me. They gave me a choice. Work it off on my back... or worse. I should have chosen worse. And I never should have left you behind. Let me help you, Rose. The last time I trusted you, I wound up here. Well, here isn't so bad, so far as I'm concerned. Flynn! Oh, jeez. We've gotta go, mate. Why? Achun's here. Oh. I've gotta go. Excuse me. Hey, come here, come here. I say, it is very tight. Do you have any oil? No matter. A little spit might do the trick! Darling, let me. I'll give it a good shove! What? Going somewhere, gentlemen? Oh, not today gents. Ripper of a show you put on today. It'd be a shame to see you depart so soon. You know, before you've had a go at snatching the title from our champ. Kid Lozetti. 33 and 0. Is that him? Oh, no, not him. Him. Thought you were getting me a real man to fight. Easy, easy. Ooh! How are you there, sweetheart? Got something to say? Easy. Word to the wise. Inform your next of kin 'cause you're going home in a box. Good night, ladies. What the hell is this? Took down his top challenger today. We're short of a pair of fists for tomorrow's fight. I invited a heap of municipal types with very deep pockets. See, what I'm thinking, you take on the kid, yeah? You go hell for leather for two rounds. I want two good rounds, you hear? Two good rounds. At the end of the third, then you go down. Real clean. No one in our outfit takes a dive. No one! Then I'm assuming no one in your outfit wants a boat with an engine. Or we just kill 'em now, Dad. Settle down, will you, son? Just settle down, all right? So what you thinking? No, don't. No, no, no, no. If I fight, what guarantee do we have? Well, you know, you seem like a pretty smart lad to me. Simple. You fail to put on a good show, you fail to take your nap at the scheduled bedtime, and you and your mates here will end up as chum for the local fishermen. Got it? You got it? Good on ya. We'll see ya tomorrow, right? Evening, boys! Good evening, Mr. Travers. Now what? It's fairly obvious these chaps intend to double cross us. Leave it with me. I've got an idea. I had a feeling he might say that. What do you want? I'm getting you out of here. Errol, the truth wouldn't hurt you every on once in a while. Travers has got you and your boys in a vice, and you need my help. Well, you know him better than us. He has our boat. What do I get out of it? Come with us. Come with us to New Guinea. We'll start fresh, you and I. You can't turn a stale crust into a fresh loaf. It's pretty clear how your story will end if you stay here, Rose. You guys take care of the fight. We'll take care of the boat. That's right, gentlemen! This one's a shoo-in for Errol Flynn, Tasmanian devil what took down The Mountain. Fight! Get to the body! Get to the... Get up! You've got him now! Come on! Why don't you try doing something called fighting? What kind of prep boy shit was that, huh? You need to gouge his eyes out. Bite the bastard! Do you wanna win, Flynn? Drink up. You go out there, and you attack him. Come on! What are you doing? Coward! You coward! Come here! Yeah? Come on! Yeah, come here! Yes! Yeah, come on! Yeah! Bring it on! Come on, Flynn, get up! Get up! Up you get! Up you get! Let's show this son of a bitch! Come on, Flynn. Attaboy. Here we go! Come on! No, no, no, no! No! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on. Listen! Hey, listen to me. Every time he goes left, he drops his right. So you make him go left. When he drops his right, explode. Hey. You promised me a shitload of gold. Come on! Why don't you stay down there where you belong? Four! Come on! Five! Get up! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Yes! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Get in there, you pussy! Get back in there! Get back there! Yeah! Three! Four! Five! Six! Come on, Boss, let's get you out of here. Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Everybody out! Come on, move it! Errol! Flynn, let's get out of here! Hey, hey, not so fast. Get your hands up. Yeah, good one. Good one, yeah. Who's been a naughty little girl then, eh? You in cahoots with these bums now, are you? She's not yours anymore, Travers. Yeah? No time like the present. Oh, spare me days. Hold your horses, all right? Spare me days. So where is it you were thinking... Shoot 'em all! What now, genius? We make a run for it. All right. Pull yourself together, you bloody idiot! Dad! Dad! Johnson, what are you doing? Staging a revolution, mate. Hey, son! Son, help me! Help yourself, you son of a bitch. This one's for my dad. Easy. Easy! Bougie dog. Have a nice day! What's going on? Rose. The girls and I made a killing from your fight. But like I said, last time I trusted you... We're not afraid of a bunch of girls. How about her? It's amazing the folk you meet making your way up the coast. The rats always return to the nest. Well done, Vassilis. Take the money. That's no way to treat a lady. Lady? Easy, easy, easy. Look... I have a genius for living too. Enjoy the consequences. You had that coming. Achun will take care of them. What's he saying? He's praying. That's not good. Where is it? We don't know what you're talking about. Hey! Ease up, sport! Shut up now! Leave him alone! No! What does that mean? You don't wanna know. Jesus. Yes. Jesus. No, no, no, no, no, no! Wait! Listen, boys, I can't deny him any longer, so where is my merchandise? Your what? The opium! In the tea box. You idiot. You! Such a pity. You had so much potential. It was me! I threw it overboard. Well... you men need no longer live. Vassilis! This is going to hurt a lot, paidi mo... I'm taking my boat back, ya bitch! They're coming! Get down! Oww! How's she looking? She's certainly seen better days, that's for sure. We're still leagues from New Guinea, and we'll be passing through the height of cyclone season. We turn back. To what? We've got half of Queensland's law after us. We're outlaws. There's more. Rain barrel took a bullet. We have no water. It's all right. We keep our heads, we'll be fine. Are you listening to me? These are our rations. It's all right. I have all I need right here. You won't be joking when your body starts shutting down, Rex! No one's body's gonna be shutting down. Know what happens to human bodies without fresh water? Stop it! Your organs fail. Stop it. Your blood thickens. You go insane! Stop being a bloody coward! Flynn. Dook. It's all falling apart now, isn't it, Admiral? Oh, shut up, will you? What are we doing out here? You know where the door is. I should've stayed in Sydney. With those razor boys on your back? Good luck. We wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't swindled the Chinese or trusted your goddamn whore. Come here! Hey! Hey! Take it back! Get off me! Hey! Hey! Take it back. You wanna know why I came on this godforsaken trip? Get off me! I came to die! Got it in my mind to make this the last voyage. Family didn't leave me. Far from it. They stuck it out. Stood by me on that very deck through thick and thin. It was the sea that took 'em from me. Achun's like a poison. You wanna talk about cowardice? Delusion? Well, you're looking at it! I didn't even have the nerve to top myself. I thought I had nothing left, except this boat. And then you sods come along. Sticking your necks out for one another, for me. That means more than any bloody gold, mate. This man is our captain, and we're his crew. Stories or not, he made us dream. Now you all quit your bloody whining. Orders, Captain? I'm no captain, Charlie. But I am certain that over that horizon is the promise of something better. And I wouldn't have brought you boys along if I didn't truly believe that we could seize it. Then let's seize it. All right. But with a new captain at the helm. I'm with you. Let's make a run at it. Till beam's end. Till beam's end. We're getting close. You know, Captain Cook ran aground in these waters. Yes, well, Cook didn't have me. This belonged to a friend of mine. He saved my life. I want you to have it. You've always looked out for me. When we were young lads, remember? When Dad lost everything in the crash... I didn't know what to do or... who I was. Then I got your letter. This person. This is the most certain I've ever been about myself. I love you, Flynn. Good lad. What's the saying? Red sky at night... Sailors sleep tight! Land. Land! We've got land, boys! We've got land, we've got land! We've got land! Land! Land! We've got land. Land! New Guinea. Thank bloody hell. Land! We've got land! What happened? We've hit a reef! Oh, my Lord. Launch the dinghy! Flynn, look around the hull. Look for bubbles. I'll check the engine. Flynn! Flynn! Dook, this is serious. I know, I know. Christ. That's the gas tank! Abandon ship! Everybody off! Come on! Flynn, come on! Everybody off! Quick! Everyone! Hurry! Wait! Charlie! Where's Charlie? Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Rex! Rex! Rex! Errol! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Come on! Come on! Come on! Charlie! What are you doing? Charlie! Hey! Charlie! Dook! Dook! Dook! Dook! Come back! Charlie! Dook! Come back! No... Dook! No, no, no! No! Rex. Where are Dook and Charlie? Where are Dook and Charlie? Where are they? They're gone. They're gone. No! They're gone. They're gone. No, no. Who are you? I'm your nurse. Where's Rex? Rex? Rex. He's fine. He said some rather disturbing things in his sleep. You should hear him when he's awake. You're both incredibly lucky. Missionaries found you. It's a miracle. I'll check on you later. Bones of many a fine sailor at the bottom of this ocean, but no men finer than Dook and Charlie. Theirs were far too kind and decent spirits to be lost so young. Mr. Flynn! Mr. Flynn! Telegram. What's it say? "Mr. Errol Flynn. Stop. Come at once to play a part in my Hollywood picture. Stop. All expenses paid. Stop. Gonna make you a star, kid. Stop. Joel Schwartz." Yes? Mr. Flynn, you have a visitor. I haven't time for any. Rex! I ran out of stories. Good to see you, old sport! Errol Flynn, pansy actor. I don't know anything about acting, but they pay me just the same. To what do I owe the pleasure? There's an uprising in Spain. I've heard. I thought I could interest you in a real adventure. It was in the Brisbane paper that year. Hell of a story. Wouldn't make a half-bad picture. Flynn! Yes, sir. Your ship is sinking. The ocean rages. And your crew, dead. Can you do that? Yeah. Okay, it's clear! Quiet on set! Roll sound! Roll camera! Action!
