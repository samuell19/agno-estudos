In July 1988, under the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, the Public Prison of Santiago houses just over 2,000 inmates. Among 120 political prisoners several members of the Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez await a sentence to death for carrying out an armed struggle against the military regime of Pinochet. For several months they have been protesting through hunger strikes to be set apart from common criminals and put together in one gallery of the prison in order to launch a dangerous escape plan. Inspired by real events. July 11, 1988 PUBLIC PRISON SANTIAGO, CHILE Change of scenery assholes! DAY 1 Damn rebels! We don't have all fucking day! Move it! Colonel! You should be ashamed of how nice you are with these fucking terrorists! Who do you think you are talking to, Andrade? We were supposed to separate them, Jorquera! Separate them. Put them in different jails from north to south. Just as they were before the Pope arrived! Don't you understand that they'll be easier to control here - in the center of the prison? - Colonel! Stop acting like a newborn puppy. Motherfuckers! They’re gonna fucking get it! Fuckers! Motherfuckers! Hurry up! Let him go! What's your problem? Get the fuck up! Move it! Move it! Don't be a tough guy with me, Jiménez. One word from me and you're off to the "Hotel" Guerilla jackoff! I'll make you my bitch anytime, motherfucker. You bunch of faggots! Good morning troops! Good morning, Colonel! From now on all military prisoners under the state's antiterrorist law will be grouped in blocks seven and eight! Security formation! You will now be assigned to the new blocks as follows! Acevedo Jorge, Arias Guillermo, Acosta Mateo, Ayala Roberto, Aliaga Benito, Barrientos Sebastián, Barril Matías, Barroso Fernando, Bustamante Iván, Canto Benjamín, Carmona Arturo, Stop! Cáceres Felipe, Castillo Nicolai, Díaz Enrique, Domínguez Javier... Move it! Move it! Come on! Keep walking! Quickly! Move it! Flores Saturnino, García Nicolás, Galindo Pablo, Gallego Mateo. Comrade Vargas. I've got a bunk set aside for Paredes. But... we can all fit in. No problem. That one, that one! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! You took number 51. It was 50. Now we're on an angle. Easy for you to say, you got the first floor. You screwed up our communication Vargas. What should we do? What should we do? We started at "engineer Vargas" style. Tell your pessimism that we'll fix it. How many years to become an engineer? Five, seven years? This isn't the one we should've taken. How many are left here? Three of them. Three. JAILBREAK PACT DAY 3 Hey, Bigote! Hey, Benito! Heard your soccer team did well! Fuck off! We'll do better next season. Econo, the packages have arrived. Just leave them over there. I'll take them right away. Come on. Pass it to me. - Why? Do you think that you're Maradona. - But this is a team work! Hey man! Fuck. ¡Gol! Benito, fatass, throw us a pass! Back there is Teatinos... and the Norgine lab. There are other stores open until nighttime. Too many people. They could see us. And what's there on the right? Amunategui to the west. There aren't many safe places there either. We have to hurry and get some outside support. Any way we can. Hey, Jiménez, we still don't know if... The party is going to build the tunnel from the outside and you're rushing. Eagerness can bring down any operation. You say that because of the mistakes you made in Carrizal, Vargas? Do you think that was my fault? I don't know. Do you know what they say about you? What do they say? Why did the attack on Pinochet fail? Jiménez... Didn't your rocket launcher jam? Come on guys, please. I didn't choose the weapons, asshole. Have you ever thought that we could've picked the wrong equipment? I don't know! I can't work with this guy anymore. Both of us in charge, it won't work out. Nobody is forcing you to be a part of this operation, Vargas. Well, if nobody is forcing me to, then I'm out. Then go. Nobody is waiting for you outside, anyway. Hey! What's going on? - Do we have a problem there? - No, officer. No problem. Both you pricks listen up! If it was up to me, I wouldn't be here. And I imagine that neither would you two. Enough sweat and blood has been shed in the past. We need to focus on this operation now because both of you are needed, given your expertise. Plus, we don't want to stay here. Right? Like this. On this side to the north is Balmaceda Avenue.. There are the palm trees... and a bit further, the Mapocho river. How do you calculate the distance? Two steps per five feet. Almost 70 meters. I have to calculate again because we need to cross the street. How much dirt are we talking about? If the terrain is sandy... and the tunnel is seventy by seventy... Nine hundred kilos per cubic meter... 50 to 70 tons, more or less. And all that's going to the crawlspace? That amount of dirt won't fit anywhere, León. The meters don't matter. We need to know how it is up there. We need to find the way to connect the cells. Let's talk about that later. Comrade Vargas, I wanted to apologize. I fucked up. I shouldn't have said what I said. I didn't mean it. Comrade Rafael, got a question for you. How long are you planning on staying here? If I had an idea, I'd already told you or you wouldn't be talking to me right now. That's what I was getting at. See, I'd like to get out of here I gather that you would, too. We would all like to leave, comrade. Can you get some outside support? Do you have a plan, comrade? I have a rough idea. You might be interested. What are you willing to do? Whatever it takes, comrade. When you have a kind of plan, we'll continue talking about. DAY 5 Over here. It's more exposed. Nobody's going to think about checking here. It's less obvious. It's less noticeable. We could cut it in the shape of a block. But, we'd have to make a replacement block. That we would have to put in and out every time we come in and out of the hole. Isn't the whole in and out cube thing too complicated? We have to do it! And we have to seal it every time we come out. What if the crawlspace plan doesn't work out? We'll think of something else then! The fake block's consistency must be exact. It needs to resist baton strikes and sledgehammers. OK. It blends in with whatever we cut in here. Go on. Hey, comrade. Want to play a little guitar? You know I don't play, Sotomayor. But I can teach you, comrade! It's really easy. Look. Fuck! You can't even tell, comrade. We're going to have to match the color so it doesn't stand out. Stand in line here, next to the fence! It's showtime. Not so rebel now, huh? Pretty boy! Which “pretty boy”? The one with the baton on his chest. Nothing "pretty" about him. Óscar Lira. Hold on, wait. Where did he come from? Welcome to this humble abode. The Chilean Department of Corrections would like to warmly welcome you. Staff! He's Eugenio Lira' son. I didn't know he had a son. A great combatant. Did you say, Lira? One of our comrades in Tres Álamos. Agile, combative, reckless. He didn't deserve what happened to him. And what happened to him? They snitched on him. Motherfuckers! The CNI executed him in the Borgoño barracks. And the snitch? The party was never able to find him. Comrade Sergio Llanos and I come in representation of the political prisoner organization O.P.P of the Public Prison of Santiago. I can't welcome you, because this place is not worthy of you. Comrade Sergio and I will give you a guided tour of the prison facilities... to show you around and... Comrade Velázquez is a doctor, so he will examine you if needed. Please, follow me. Did you see the crew of rebels that just arrived? If only these people... would accept how wrong they are. If only they could understand that their ideas have fooled them. How can one be so wrong? Perhaps a matter of family education? Why do these people, that have nothing to do... with the trash of these jails. End up behaving just like the rest of them? In the end, you can't even tell them apart. That's quite a reflexion there, prosecutor. - Are you writing a book? - Don't be a smartass, Colonel. And what is this woman doing here? They say she has an appointment with Warden Jorquera. Look officer, you know very well that I am Fabiola Pizarro CODEPU attorney and he is father Gerard Fôvet of the Vicariate of Solidarity. Unfortunately, there are no chapels in this prison, father. We're here to learn about the health conditions of the detainees. Specially the most recent ones. Because there are reports that state that they were systematically tortured and there are legal provisions... Who told you that we were treating them better? Prosecutor Andrade. You need to immediately authorize a signature, so that I can enter... Not this woman again. This is not the time for jokes. I have an application for protection in favor of Óscar Lira and there are many ongoing lawsuits. All those documents are going to be filed away gathering dust somewhere. Mister, "Ad Hoc". Be careful. You never know when a shelf might fall on your head. Any day I can take these pretty criminals of yours to have a nice little chat with Charlie. The CNI does not have any legal right to interfere with the inmates under custody of the Corrections Department. Specially with their ongoing legal cases. This lady also thinks that I can't do, what she thinks I can't do. Wait, wait, wait. Come in. Good afternoon, comrades. The O.P.P has assigned me to this cell. Lira? Yes. Óscar. Nice to meet you, comrade. I'm Luis Fernández. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Welcome, comrade. Nicolai Castillo. We're also with the Front. It'll be a bit tight in here... but we'll be OK. I see you have cigarette burns. Any other injuries? Let's go see the comrade doctor. DAY 11 Open the door, officer! At your order, officer! The interior ministry will prosecute you invoking the homeland security law. You may also be tried for mistreatment to military personnel. If you end up connected to the two dead guards you could be facing the death penalty. No. I have nothing to do with that. Nothing! But, how real is... this death threat? It’s quite real. Especially now that Pinochet gave carte blanche to prosecutor Andrade and he takes this very personally. And do you think you could get me off those charges? Or am I a condemned man? Here's the legal sponsorship and proxy. I need a signature. Are you OK? We have to cover this shit up! A nude photo, I don't know! We need to hide it! We could cover it up with plaster. We need eggs! This isn't the time for your fucking jokes, Vargas! I'm serious. Chicken eggs! Like the "Cal y Canto" bridge. We can bond the bricks with lime and eggs. - Does that actually work? - Yes! You never used eggs, architect? Eggs are for eating for fucks sake! It's like making an omelette! Trust me on this! Let's go look for some eggs then! Clean the debris, Vargas. Pituco, get me some newspapers and water. Coming. How are you doing, comrade Cancino? How are you doing, comrade Jiménez? Sorry to bother you. Do you by any chance have eggs? Hey, guys. - Would you give me a hand? - Of course, comrade! Hello, comrade. Hey there, singer. May I come in? I'm about to close up, comrade Jiménez. I know that. I got caught up with work... and I couldn't make it earlier. I'm sorry. - What do you need? - Could I borrow something to "read"? I need eggs. How many? A lot. To jerk off? How many omelettes? A whole tray just for yourself? Whenever I get a conjugal visit, I just can't... And what are you celebrating? Some new prisoners arrived and there's hardly any space left... and they need to be fed. Am I invited? OK Lalo, pick one but I want it back. Could you spare just a little bit more? For the rest of the week? I have six. Good enough? Yeah, OK. Thank you, comrade. All right, take some. Thank you, comrade. But comrade, too much clothes on them. Why don't you take her instead? Or Mariteta? And what's in the omelette? Whatever we can get, I guess. Hey, Sánchez. I want some of that omelette. I'll keep watch. Pituco, bring to us the rubbles. OK comrades, how about a little song? There's more than enough of us. Come on, shakedown! Leave no cell unturned! When your mind starts to wander off I'd like to take you for a walk On a long tour That's pretty. Lalo is playing "Sol y Lluvia"! These fucking drunks think they're sopranos. By Pudahuel When nothing happens And everything does Don't forget about these cells! Clean yourself up! What are you doing here, Velázquez? - Workshop meeting, Sergeant. - And the others? Come on, move it! Whose left inside? A terrorist, sir. Really? So you're a funny guy. Get out! Mr. Vargas... Do you want me to wait all day? Come out I said! Assholes. Bravo! Are you done up there? This bitch has too many clothes on. Let's go! Let us through. Keep checking all the cells! Come on, come on! Over there! DAY 34 FREEDOM FOR ALL COMBATANTS Silence! Weren't you in a hurry? Come on, lady! Come on! Quickly! Packages through the right door! Come on! Quickly! - How are you, Emilio? - I'm fine. And you, father? Lock it up. Keep a line and listen to what you are being told. Come on, lets begging. What's in the box? Medical equipment. Your name, sir? Gastón Velázquez. The burlap sales have been doing well. Here are the details so that you can tell the comrades. Make sure to keep a record. Thank you, father. I found a magazine that León asked for. "Engineering magazine". You know that comrade León is a solitary animal. He rarely leaves his cave when there are visits. Don't take this the wrong way father. But I'd rather be in this wheelchair... than knowing... what it feels like to have my entire family murdered. You can't compare the pain. Grief... is dealt with. Not forgotten. We don't really believe that stuff around here... and I don't really know what León believes. Name? Paulina Baeza. Paulina Baeza. How many packages? One. - Who are you visiting? - Rafael Jiménez. Who are you visiting? Turn around. The purse stays here! Turn around. Keep moving! Keep moving! Do you still trust on that paper? Hello. How are they treating you? Lovely. And mom? Fernanda? They weren't able to come, unfortunately. Your mom's tied up with house chores and Fernanda busy with a job I got her in a school with a friend of mine. Hello. Hello. How are you? Fine... Thank you. And the kids? I made this for them in the workshop. We need to talk. Shouldn't the kids be present? No, because we'll get in an argument so I left them home for now. I left the package you requested in the office. I don't know if they'll let it through. I don't know what's the big deal with bringing in first aid kits. There are knives in there, blades... - you can easily get stabbed. - Has it happened to you? No, dad. I'm a political prisoner, I'm separated from the rest of the inmates and we look after each other. I thought they kept you all together, no distinctions. What's your point? Nothing. I'm taking the kids to Curicó. That's OK. On vacations? No. For living. - For living? - Yes. - Are you fucking kidding me, Paulina? - No! I'm not fucking kidding you. I have a lot of work with the party and the referendum is getting closer. You're sending the kids to Curicó just because of that fucking referendum? Please, quiet! I don't see the kids at all. I have too much work to do. I can't take care of the house chores any longer. Children aren't chores Paulina! Funny you should judge me when it's about things I want to do. But you forget about the time when politics were more important than our family. Right? Or did you forget? I never thought I would be giving you a stethoscope in a place like this. Neither did I. Thanks for remembering. Remember when I gave you your first one? The same day you got accepted into the Catholic University Medical School. I knew you would get in. Here? Then you made up that scholarship in Cuba and left the Catholic University. The CU didn't have what I was looking for. And Cuba did? I'm locked up in here. I wait all week to see the kids - and you leave them at home. - I'm going to bring them. The referendum is nothing but business. And since you're so keen on memories. May I remind you it was you who left me. You can understand that I didn't want the decisions you made to land you in jail! Have you ever thought that my decisions are a consequence. And that your beloved general is the cause? And you had to be jailed because of it? But you can't hide the fact that you're ashamed of me. I didn't come here to argue, Patricio. It was never my intention to dishonor you, dad! Say hi to mom and Fernanda for me. Chile, happiness is coming. DAY 56 Chile, happiness is coming. Silence comrades, it's about to start. Chile, happiness is coming. Good afternoon. For the first time in15 years, those who disagree can finally have the chance to address you through.. It's just a load of bullshit. To move towards happiness... They must think we're stupid. Because after the rain, rainbows appear Well you heard them comrades happiness is on its way. Without dictatorship Happiness will arrive Because I believe in the future I will say NO! Let's say "NO"! With the force of my voice Let's say "NO"! I sing it without fear Let's say "NO"! For life and peace Get up, Bustamante! Inmate review! Jesus Christ, again! Get up, motherfucker! Move your ass! What the fuck do you want? Don't take him! - Move it! Move it! - Hurry the fuck up! They took Bigote! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Bigote! It still needs some weight. It has to dry off. How do you feel, comrade? They grab me by the neck and hit several time on my face. And what they wanted? Remembering me that "happiness" is not going to come? That hurts. Your body doesn't hurt, then? No, it doesn't. I have some aspirins, I can share some. Thank you, comrade. Thank you, doctor. Better? Yes. - Fuck! Officer Braulio is coming! - What? Now? He's coming over here! Stall him! Stall! Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Everything OK, officer? - Good afternoon. Is prisoner Velásquez here? He's at another workshop. OK. He needed some medicine. Can one of you tell him to go to my office? We'll let him know officer, no problem. OK. I'm off. Keep doing your work. Another long night Of walking Another end of the month With nothing new My friends were left behind Just like you This year is over The 12 games were over Come join the dance Of the leftovers Nobody will miss us Nobody wanted to help us at all They told us when we were young Make a game out of studying All men are brothers And must work together You heard all the advice All eyes on the teacher There was a lot of sun Over their heads And it wasn’t true Because those games Ended with laurels and dreams Of the future for some - And left my friends kicking stones - Come join the dance Of the leftovers Nobody will miss us Nobody wanted to help us at all Hey I’ve heard some tales DAY 59 About the future Hey, the moment when I learned them DAY 67 Was safer Underneath our shoes Mud and cement There is no future Promised in the twelve games Others were taught secrets That they didn’t tell you Others got that thing called education They demanded effort and dedication What for? To end up dancing - And kicking stones - Come join the dance Of the leftovers DAY 77 How much? One ninety. We're still lacking manpower. Move it rebels! Shut the fuck up and move it outside! Now! Move it! Move it! Again with these pricks? When will they cut it out? Out of your shithole, asshole! I'm going to look through all of your shit! Outside! What's wrong with this rebel? You think you're a hero? You pricks are nothing but trash. You've been so brainwashed. You can't even notice the butchery that you're so proudly a part of. - Butchery, you say? - Yes! Butchery! Let me go! Your party will soon be over! Be grateful for the week you'll stay at the hotel. Get in there. Get him in there! Prisoner Sánchez! Officer? What's in there? What do you think? Four molotov cocktails and five grenades. Open it. What for? I already told you. - I'm going upstairs. - Open it. What did I tell you? Nothing but rebel shit. You'd like that. Right? Follow me Sánchez! - Come on, officer... - Follow me! And the bag? What was I going to bring it here for? And how are you going to take these...? I need some new ones. You could've told me that in the stairway. Private business. - Where is Germán? - Mad Dog took him. It was a close call. On your feet rebel Lira! Hopefully, the week in the hotel helped you understand where you are and what behavior is expected of you. I have not told you, Jorquera. Not so much of a loud mouth now. Son-of-a-bitch. How strange... the apple does fall far from the tree. For a second I thought you were as educated as your father. You don't know anything about my father, Andrade. Shut up. I do... I know he's at the bottom of the sea. Get him, get him! Fuck! Calm down, Lira! Calm down. Unless you want to spend another week in the hotel! Or I could take you for a walk. Who knows? You could meet up with your old man. DAY 83 Hello, son. Don't waste your time coming here, father. I don't believe in your saints. God's mercy has a lot to do with fellowship. And also with the union of different ideologies. I believe that you and I are on the same path. Oh, really? And where did you get that? - From a Vatican manual? - No. The Frente's declaration of principles. Farewell, comrade León. Lice! What are you doing here? What's wrong? I don't think it's a good idea... A child... With you in here. How is it not a good idea? I don't think you understand how things are out there. I do. That's why we have to create our own world. But not separate worlds. Specially with you in here, not knowing when you're getting out... Mom is really upset. Really upset. I promised her I'd take care of everything over here. So you came to take care of the "trigger happy" son. I haven't said that. You're such a liar, man. Why didn't you join our cause then? Why did you abandon me and dad? You never liked this stuff. Fuck way to start the conversation! The fact that you and dad decided to join the "Frente" doesn't mean that we should too. That's the path that you chose! What path, man? You've never believed or respected what I believe in... what dad believed in... Or this cause. Don't you worry about me, because I don't care. My beliefs brought me here and your beliefs kept you out there. OK, Pituco. Keep it tight! Like that? Just three meters and ninety-seven centimeters, Pituco. I don't know if this plan is feasible, Lalo. The Interior Ministry's national tally. 51,30 % for option "Yes". 46,51% for option "No". It's a setup, comrades! Fuck off you fucking fascist! Tell me you didn't know this was going to happen. It goes without saying. We're going to fucking rot in this place. Pinochet is never leaving. Pituco, pass me the jug! Coming. "Cooperativa" radio station is on the line! Thank you, Ana Laura Cataldo. It is one o'clock in the AM. The following information comes from "La Moneda" palace. General Fernando Matthei... has acknowledged the victory of "NO". General Matthei has made a statement this... The chief executive of the police... Rafael! Patricio! They chose "NO"! - Rafa! - Yeah? - Did you hear? - What? They chose "NO"! What? They chose "NO"! Come out! We're going to have to hurry up... We have to escape before Pinochet leaves. DAY 86 - Where do you hide the dirt? - In the crawlspace. In the crawlspace. Is it too complicated? You have to bend over a little bit. Yeah sure. "Bend over a little bit". We have chosen you from over more than one hundred political prisoners... Because we know well what each one of you can provide for this operation. But especially, because we completely trust all of you. But you have to understand that there’s no turning back. Success isn’t guaranteed either. We’ll make four daily two hour shifts where all of us will dig through the tunnel and hide the debris in the crawlspace. We must be capable of digging and moving a hundred kilos of dirt per day. Make sure to clean off any dirt that could give you away. The parts of your body that aren’t visible to you are visible to others. Now, that we’re a bigger group we have to connect the cells internally to lower the risk of getting caught. The success of this plan relies solely on us never losing focus. You know well where we failed on past operations. Or we wouldn’t be locked up in here. We are trained to know where, how and what to look at. And at the same time... Being mindful of those who watch us every day. You better memorize the beats and rotations of each one of these cops. You know how it goes. When we get too confident is when we make the most mistakes. Let’s not break the maximum security protocol. Division is key to our success. If you want to recruit more people propose a list of names and we’ll see where it goes. I’d like us to continue our conversation. I have people waiting for me on the outside too, comrade. But I don’t think you’re going to be able to play with your kids in the park after breaking out of here. And who says I am going to stay in Chile? What do you think of Bigote? He’s in charge of the workshops, he could be of great help. Then? I don’t know. The bags we use for the dirt won’t go through the tunnel that will connect the cells. We have to move the debris using something that can handle the weight. Something that resists the friction caused by the constant moving. Even though it’ll be over 50 degrees up there we can only work during the day. Because we need the daylight that filters through the zinc plates. It’s better if you don’t talk. Because the crawlspace acts as a sound box. Working at night is not feasible. Mice? No, they're just pigeons that get in there in the crawlspace. The shifts will be intense and exhausting. But you can’t neglect your daily routines. You have to act normal even if you are tired. Physical exhaustion will be noticeable if you don’t make sure to eat well. Staying healthy is key if you want to survive to this operation. If you’re not willing to take this seriously you might as well leave now to not jeopardize the rest of us. Don’t change the schedule in which you normally do things. It’s better if nobody notices that you have been missing for a couple of hours. Don’t be late to any meeting or commitments you may have made. Good morning. Good afternoon. Just like in previous operations. We can only rely on ourselves. Let’s think of this prison as a temporary station. Not our final stop. - What's up, asshole? - Easy, Jiménez. I want in. What do you mean? I can also move dirt. What are you trying to say? I know what you're up to. Look at your fingernails, Jiménez. I'm in? Cooperativa Radio is calling! From the Maule region we have been informed that an attack has occurred in the Los Quenes police station... DAY 149 ...located in the community of Chincol near Curicó. The attack that has been credited to the Manuel Rodríguez Front. Fuck. Has resulted in the death of one of the officers present at the police station. It has also been informed that the structural damages are evident, given that the attacker have allegedly set fire to the station. I don’t know what the fuck they have against the cops in Los Queñes! I don’t know what’s the point of an operation like that. It was irresponsible, reckless. Shit like this is only going to put people against us! We need to evaluate the consequences and see how this could affect us. The worst of it all is that it’s going to weaken whatever outside support we could’ve had. This won't work without any outside help. Paulina could get us support from trusted comrades. People that believe in us. He's right. You could get a "conyugal". No suspicions there. DAY 182 Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Alfonsito Happy birthday to you I never thought it possible to escape from here. We need some outside help. We need helpers, safe houses. An attorney. Your influence could help us change the minds of the party's leadership. But it's too risky, Rafael. Have you ever thought of what could happen if they catch you out there? These subversive criminals they killed an officer. Do you understand? Now the special forces engaged the leaders of the Queñes attack and killed some guy called Pellegrin and another one named Magni. There ́s a war going on out there declared by the same terrorists we have locked up in here! We can’t allow them to riot in here! Understood? Yes, Colonel! DAY 205 Open the gates! - Do what you have to do, Sergeant! - Yes, Colonel! Shake down! Two of them...! All you fucking bums get outside! Nicolai, Lalo!...Get out! Lalo! Lalo! We have to get out! And Lalo? Lagging behind! As soon as Lalo gets out, seal it off! Why are you guys bothering us again? Can't you people let us work in peace? Listen you fucking cripple. You got no one to blame for that wheelchair but yourself, for killing cops. The only difference between you and your communist pals is that a bullet gave you justice before the courts did! You either wheel yourself outside or we ́re gonna play rag doll and drag your crippled ass out of there. Outside I said! Outside I said! Outside I said! Call for reinforcements, officer Bravo. Riot on block eight. Send reinforcements! Over. Releasing the dogs already, you coward? Don’t you realize that these are nothing but thugs with guns? The scourge of our country! You're afraid Quezada... Pure Chile is the blue skies Pure breezes that cross you as well And your field of blooming flowers Is the happy copy of Eden A majestic white mountain Was awarded to you by the Lord Wait! Was awarded to you by the Lord And the calm sea that bathes you Promises a future glory And the calm sea that bathes you Promises a future glory Sweet homeland Receives the votes Those that Chile swore in oath For you will be the grave of the free Or an asylum against oppression For you will be the grave of the free Or an asylum against oppression For you will be the grave, of the free! Or an asylum against oppression Revolution! Or an asylum against oppression Revolution! Or an asylum against oppression Revolution! Get up, Jiménez! Quite the whorehouse you rattled up there. If I'd rattled up a whorehouse, I would've invited your mommy. Such a tough guy. All those fists up in the air... and I bet your "gun" is about this big now. Let me guess where you shoved up those grenades. It's all coming apart, "comrade"... we're fucking you up, no argument there. Tell me something, Jiménez. After you gave everything up for that cheap ideology of yours. After you lost your marriage, your children, your friends. Did you ever imagine winding up in here? And did you ever imagine ending up licking boots in order to look after guys like me? Always the smart mouth, Jiménez. DAY 217 We will not encourage or support any operation that could get out of hand! With consequences that we may regret! This isn't the same. They aren't going to kill anybody. They only want to escape undetected. Without facing the officers, the army, the police? Yeah, right... It's really easy to escape without confrontation. Look, Paulina. People chose "No" and now we're going to have an election for the first time in 19 years! The country has the opportunity to regain democracy at last! Do you really think we will? We cannot support a prison break under these circumstances in this scenario! It doesn't make sense! How does it not make sense to escape under a dictatorship? Our comrades have proven their commitment to our cause. If they screw up now, we're all fucked! The party was not invited to take part in the agreements. Not officially. But we have the historical opportunity to participate in the democratic reconstruction of this country. This is something that I cannot decide on my own. I need to consult with the other members. Do what ever you need to do and let me know when you get your piece of the pie. I'd love to try some of it! I know that I was irresponsible in the past. That I gave my life for the party. That I abandoned you. That I did not worry for your safety or the kids. But this is the only way in which all of our sacrifices will not be in vain. Freedom Open the earth Take my song Scratch the stone That the world is crying Face your fears Extinguish your fire Let your body laugh Face infinity Feel its beats Beating against the soil This soil is worthy Break free from your chains Drill through the bricks Open every wall Hug your senses Expand your cries For every escapee Blow at the pure air Liberated at times Lose gravity Float in deliriousness Run away without destination For every detainee Awaken the memory That you thought was dead Nobody is forgotten Justice is nearby We regret history And the story is this This Where freedom awaits Tell me where Tell me where it is Tell me where is it hiding Tell me why it’s not answering Tell me why it left It has left us They call it freedom Tell me where Tell me where it is Tell me where is it hiding Tell me why it’s not answering Tell me why it left It has left us They call it freedom They blindfolded me Adding anger In the name of God State and a certain democracy They killed my name They gave me a skirt They shot an arrow Stabbed me with a sword They cut my wings A cold winter night While the world was Searching for my bones An answer, while shame Was kneeling at The edge of their tables Judges judged me crucified me They put a scale On my left hand I appealed for my life Shouting every wound Of a gray Pidgeon that was Searching for justice Listen to the breeze The life that sighs A breath of humanity A song of life They say I’ve disappeared I exist while nobody forgets me Listen to the freedom that’s coming Tell me where Tell me where it is Tell me where is it hiding Tell me why it’s not answering Tell me why it left It has left us they call it freedom Tell me where Tell me where it is Tell me where is it hiding Tell me why it’s not answering Tell me why it left It has left us they call it freedom Tell me where Tell me where it is Tell me where is it hiding Tell me why it’s not answering Tell me why it left It has left us they call it freedom Now it does reek of shit! - How are you doing? - Hello? The court has just ruled in favor of the death penalty. There is still some due process, but "we're doing well". Please, could you give me a couple of minutes with the defendant? You'll like these, Jiménez. They're made by your beloved Fidel. Excuse me. Don't be afraid, we still have time for more appeals. The only thing that scares me is not being able to finish what I started. The accused, Rafael Jiménez I talked to Paulina. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've gathered you here because our comrades need support with their operation. Especially considering that some of them are facing the death penalty. I don't need to tell you that you can count on me. I know a lot of people that I believe are willing to take the risks. Quena? Whatever you need. You know that you can count on me. Especially when their physical and emotional integrity is at play. But, always on the condition that they don't use weapons. DAY 392 How long? Xavier! Xavier, we’re almost at 10 meters! Xavier! Xavier! Pituco! Pituco! Xavier! Xavier is not moving! Xavier! Xavier! Xavier! Xavier! What happened to Xavier is called hypoxia. He’s OK. He’s recovering. But clearly there is not enough air at the end of the tunnel. Any one of us could suffocate. I have an idea to fix it. But we don't have the necessary materials. There’s something that we need to get from the outside. But I don’t think it can be smuggled in. Mr. Jiménez... I'm here to give you the details of your case. How are you, Rafael? I feel like smoking... How are things doing? Wrapped in polyethylene. How much is left? Comrade Salgado, I need to ask you a favor. I need a motor. A motor? What type of motor? Like the one you use to polish stuff. No man. No way! We always have to use that motor. Don't you see there are bones and wood that need polishing? You could always say that yours broke and ask for a new one. Right? Come on, Jiménez. Do you think that cops are stupid? That doesn't sound like a good argument. That motor... could be your ticket out of here, comrade. Out where? To freedom! You are going crazy. DAY 413 We have air, comrades! These are some of the inmates facing the death penalty. The Court Martial has already ruled against them and the final verdict by the Supreme Court should come soon after. Since we don't have maximum security prisons here in Chile. Our best bet is to separate and isolate them in different prisons around the country. It will happen by the end of this year or at the beginning of next. Comrade Salvador. Represented. Commander Tamara. Represented. Comrade Miguel. Represented. OK, comrades. Light it up. The court martial has ruled nine death sentences which shall be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The defendants are accused of an attack against General Pinochet each one of these attacks are in different stages of the prosecution such as the case of Rafael Jiménez, Germán Sánchez and Patricio Velásquez. I'm not going to make it out of here. I'm working on your assignment, your honor. I thought you said the Frente trusted you and that they would provide information. It hasn't been easy. And do you think is easy for Nuria your wife, your partner, your whore to take your five year old child to school given she's six months pregnant just to go to work later as a seamstress at your aunt Marita's house located in El Manío 4971, La Florida neighborhood? Start talking unless you want everybody to know about us. DAY 524 Given the surrender of the government just as it is written in the political constitution of the republic. I would like to reach all regions of the country to testify... Comrade Bigote. I'd like to have a word. Go ahead, comrade. It's just that... A cigarette? Who has had the honor of leading the armed forces and the forces of order... These are pretty good, comrade. - Where'd you get them? - They're from the island. A comrade of mine sends them over. Sounds like a pretty good comrade, huh? I have one good news and one bad... Give me the good and the bad, father. Let's see.. Good news is that the ink went through but not in the place that should. Bad news is that we're still short 40 feet. 40 feet? Anything else that I can help you with? Confession, maybe? I told you I don't believe in your saints, father. Even less in a merciful God. If he existed, don't you think he's doing a pretty shitty job? I understand how you feel. I know your story. But prayer is always a good refuge. The Lord listens to all those who have faith. Don't preach to me about faith. You'll never know what it's like to lose your wife and daughter. Don't ask me to find relief in prayer, because I won't find it. The only thing that is certain is that I will never see their faces again. I'll never hear their voices again. All I have is a picture of them. To know that they were real. Do you have a picture of your boss? How many people are going to escape? It’s 120 of us. Forget it, too many. You’re going to have to choose. DAY 559 Earthquake! Careful with the wall! Move it! Out! Quickly! Why are you so late to come out? Comrade Llanos twisted his foot. We had to help him. How you are so stupid, Llanos? Sign him up with officer Medina to go the infirmary. Move it. Rebels! Earthquake ́s over. Head count! The comrades that were digging got lucky. A little bit of sloughing but the tunnel won't take another tremor like that. It can come down any minute. The cops are going to want to make a full inspection. They'll discover the tunnel! Or they could send us to another prison! What shall we do? Comrades, we cannot waste any more time. We have to leave, now! You know that we can't fit them all in the backpack. I'm not asking you to take them all. Only... if you could take as much as you can. Would you come with us? If you could, that is. To go with you would be a hell of an adventure. But it won't make me feel any better. I live with it. And you? Will you truly feel free when you're out? I don't know how far I'll make it. But outside It'll be easier to move, to ask, to find out. To do everything possible to find those behind the murder of my family. That's why, as soon as you're out. Run as fast as you can. Run. But also... run for me. Run for your comrades for their relatives. For those that cannot run anymore. I will. Even though we can't bring our loved ones back. Stalemate. January 29, 1990 DAY 567 Time to start your shift. Attention, the second group is almost ready. Comrade, have you seen Rafael? Huh? - Have you seen Rafael? - No... What's with that face, Bigote? Where are you off to? Have you seen Jiménez? What do you want him for? Need to talk to him. Talk to me then... Talk to me. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why did you stop belonging? León, why are we not moving? You have no idea of what's happening, Emilio. Explain it to me, then. There's no time for that! Tell me. We're supposed to be friends! I can ́t, there ́s no time. Have you seen Jiménez! Answer! Have you seen, Jiménez? Easy, Bigote. Some fuckers are escaping. Easy. Let's go... My family... Fuck... Get in there... Come on! My family... What are you going to do, motherfucker? Rat us out as usual? Get in the tunnel! I'm not a fucking snitch. It has begun. Two full years digging a hole just so you can come over and fuck it up? Come on! Let’s go! The bus will be driving in circles. It will be waiting for us in the rendez-vous. We only have five minutes to leave. If anyone lags behind... the bus leaves with or without them. Understood? Yeah, yeah. Turn the search lights on, point them over there. I'll alert the others! We've got to go! Let's go! Come on, come on! And Óscar? I don't know. Didn't see him come out. I'm going back for him. - I'm going back for him. - Germán! Germán! Come on, come on! Come! Come! All right! Get in! What happened to Germán? - We have to wait. - What's wrong? We have to wait! Three minutes Rafael! Three minutes and we're gone! THE END Gentlemen! The movie is over! Back to your cells! Come on, come on! Comrade Muñoz! Comrade! Oso! Oso! Oso, don't waste your time on me. There's a window; an opportunity to escape. Tell the others! Through Jiménez's cell! Come on, wake up! Come on. Move it! Follow him! Follow him! Come on! Run! Follow Oso! What's wrong? Why aren't we leaving? Call for reinforcements! Come on, come on! We have to leave, now! Let's go. Go. Hold on! There they come! Don’t fucking move! Don’t move! On the floor motherfucker! Get these piece of shit out there! Everybody out! Get these pricks out there! The police have stated that traffic towards Santiago between seventeen and twenty-three hundred. It has also been stated that all vehicles headed towards Valparaíso and Viña del Mar, during this period must use the “Cinco Sur” route through La Calera. Yes, general, yes. Identify! Colonel Jorquera, general, yes. Where are you? Moving into the hall, sir. Keep me posted. Yes sir, over and out. Colonel. In this block of 120 political prisoners 49 have escaped. Hello? Group one! Get ready! Eyes open, group two! Group three! Get ready! Group four! On January 29th, 1990, a total of 49 political prisoners escaped from the Public Prison of Santiago in what is known as "Operación Éxito." Some crossed the border and still they remain living abroad. Others were pardoned by President Patricio Aylwin in the first democratic government that succeeded the dictatorship imposed by General Pinochet for more than 17 years. This has been the largest jailbreak in the history of Chile.
