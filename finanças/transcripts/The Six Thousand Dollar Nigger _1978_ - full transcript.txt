That is impossible. I cannot experiment on humans yet. I don't see why not, Dr. Dippy. You've tried it on animals, and it works. But that is just it. It works on animals, but I am not sure that it will work on humans. Besides, even if it did, the subject would die one week after receiving the injection. Yes, but does the person have to die? Excuse me. Doctor, here are the reports. Thank you. Like I was saying, Doctor, why does the person have to die? Did you see that girl that just came in? I did. I saw that big, wide ass. Never mind that. What I am referring to is what she is doing. Peggy is working with five different compounds, which she has to mix in order to derive one white in color. When she accomplishes this, that will mean that we have found the neutralizer. But, Doctor, what's the neutralizer for? The theory is pretty complicated. But what it boils down to is that the neutralizer must be administered exactly one week after the injection, if the subject is to live. Whew. Wow. Well, that sounds slick. What's the problem? The real problem is that we don't know the exact proportion of the compounds that will give us the right color to tell us that we have found the neutralizer. But Doctor, that could take weeks! It may even take months, or a year. Who knows? Shit! We've already put up $6,000 for this experiment. We just don't have time. You're not going to get another damn dime from us unless-- If we don't pull this deal in three days, we're gonna blow the whole thing. Doctor, tell me just one more time, what happened when you gave these injections to the mice. I'd like to straighten out a few things in my head. We gave, uh, one of the lab mice a small injection, proportionate to the mouse's body weight, et cetera, et cetera. After half an hour after allowing the injection to work with the mouse's system, we put a cat into the cage with the mouse. Within one minute, the mouse had destroyed the cat. [LAUGHTER] Boy, I'd sure hate to see that rat. Look at him. He died. Exactly one week after receiving the injection, he died. This is the reason why we must find the neutralizer. Hey, Bob, you take the damn injections. We can pull the job by the end of the week, and Dr. Dippy will have the neutralizer ready. Right, Doc? Bullshit. You get the extra million. No deal. No deal. Then what do you suggest? I'd just say forget about the neutralizer. Listen, we can get a nigga off the street, give him the injections, let him pull the job. And then in a week, he'll be dead. We don't even have to tell him about his short future. Hey, then we'll be able to split his share. Yes. But who on earth would-- Oh, don't worry about it, Doc. I'll get a wino. Yeah, I'll get me a wino out the ghetto. Hah. Well, I wish him luck. [MUSIC PLAYING] Steve! Yeah. Give me a cigarette! I told you, John A. Jacobs, I don't have no cigarettes. You are a bum! Oh, man, go and have yourself a drink, and leave me alone. Which one of you motherfucking goddamn niggas took my goddamn newspaper? We found it out there in the streets! That's right. We found the paper in the street. Man, we ain't messed with your papers in over a month! For three goddamn weeks, you goddamn niggas been taking my paper every motherfucking morning. [SHOUTING] Wait a second, man. Wait a minute. Man, that's my business! Oh, don't hit me no more, please! Oh, Oh! Please, please, don't hit me no more. Ow! Ow! Let's get the hell outta here! Wait a minute, man. Let me get my newspaper! Goddamn. Oh my god, you killed him! You killed him! Friend. Don't shoot me! Hey, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. I ain't gonna shoot you. - I didn't take your paper! I ain't gonna shoot you, man. Don't worry about it. You don't know it, but this is your lucky day. Come on, get up. Get up. - I didn't steal nothing. - No, no, no. This is your lucky day. Listen, your horse just came in first. You have hit the number! I didn't play the number. Don't worry. I'm your lucky number. Come on. I'm gonna take care of you. Now, you see, Jim, this is as far as we have been able to get in our research. Oh, really? No more. I don't know what happened, but that's as far as we've been able. What in the hell is that? This is my wino. Is that the best you could do? Oh, Doc, hell, he can do it. All we gotta do is kind of let him dry out a little bit and clean him up. Let him get a little rest. You'll see. He's gonna be perfect. Sheesh! Say, Doc, I don't think we've get much of a choice. Do your thing. If this thing works using that thing, it'll be a miracle. [GROANING] Easy, come on. Bob, give me a hand. I want to examine him. Peggy, will you come here, please? Yes, Doctor. I need your help. I want you to get a blood sample and take his blood pressure. All right? Yes, Doctor. Then I also need a complete medical history, if he has one. All right? Yes, Doctor. I have to go and discuss some things with Jim and Bob. Call me when you have all the information, OK? Suppose he dropped dead like that mouse? So what? He'd just be another dead nigger. Please, what's your name, sir? [MUMBLING] My name is Steve. Steve. S-T-E-V-E. All capital letters. Oh, God damn. Baby, you-- you-- I must be in heaven. But why do you say that? You-- you look like an angel. I ain't never had an angel take care of me like this. I wish them niggas would hit me in the head again in the morning. Why do you want them to hit you again? So I can wake up with you holding my head and looking at me and everything. Oh, God. Please, please lie still. I need to take your blood pressure. Take my blood pressure if you want. Just take anything you want. I don't care what you take. Just go on and take it, baby. Please, please, I need to take a urine sample. A what? And I need to take a urine sample. A urine sample? I ain't let you take no urine sample, me laid up in here. You ain't gonna take no urine sample, with my laying up here. Please, why can't you take a urine sample? Laying in this position, woman, I'll piss in my pants. I have to stand up to pee! How's my blood pressure, baby. Please lie still. I'm lying still, but I just asked you a question. You know, all black people have blood pressure. I just asked you how it was. Huh? Is it all right? Huh? I just wanna know. You just ask like you don't even hear me talking. How's the blood pressure? Would you be kind enough to tell me how it is? Oh, boy. [INAUDIBLE] I get out of here? Oh. Is everything-- What are you writing down there? You're always writing something down. You don't ever tell me nothing. Please, I want you to turn over, breathe deeply while I put this in your rectum. Stick that in my rectum? Yes, please. You mean that you're gonna try to stick that pole in my asshole? Woman, you crazy! Please turn over, sir. [SCREAMING] Shit, Bob, you're the one that's sick, not him. Will you shut up and just listen to me? Listen, all the way here, I was talking to Steve. Yeah, OK, so what, talking to Steve? Listen, it's the perfect setup. The nigga ain't got no home, no place to live, no place to go, nothing. Absolutely nothing. In other words, if the experiment is a failure, we can just dispose of him and nobody will know any better. Thank you for having such confidence in my ability. Aw, come on, Doc. That's-- that's not what I meant. Listen, it's better to have a bum. He'll do anything. He'll play ball. He'll do anything I say. Listen, leave it to me. I-- I know what I'm doing. You know, Bob, I hate to admit it, but maybe this guy may not be so bad after all. Now I've heard everything. Oh, you hurt me, baby! Gah! Oh, God damn. Woo! DIPPY: Hey, What is going on? Oh, damn! Doctor, Doctor! What is all the yelling about? Doctor, Doctor. This woman. This woman makes my asshole into a tunnel of love. Look, Steve, I promise you that if you cooperate and let us finish the examination, you will feel better than you have ever felt in your life. He's telling you right, my man. As a matter of fact, in a few hours, you're gonna have your own pad. I ain't got no money to get no [INAUDIBLE] pad, no apartment. I ain't never had that much money in my life. Well, you're gonna have it. Think about it, a big, fine, king-sized bed, all the fine foods you can eat. Everything the best, just for you, if you do exactly what the doctor tells you. But-- but why me, man? What? I don't understand. I'm a nobody. Why me? Don't worry about that. I'll explain it to you when we get to the apartment, OK? I don't understand. You'll be all right, man. Just be cool. I don't understand this. I think you can finish the examination now, Peggy. Let's go. Yes, Doctor, as you say so. I don't understand what's going on here. What's going on? Bob, be sure to get Steve the best pad you can find. And if you can think of anything else that'll make him happy, don't hesitate to get it for him. Don't worry, don't worry. Listen, I know how to handle this joker. I'm gonna get him all the extras. Believe me, when I'm through with him, he's gonna feel just like he's on cloud 9. OK, brother. TCB. You know, Jim, I think Bob knows how to handle this guy. I sure in the hell hope he does. I hope you see what I see. My 20/20 tells me that you is a mighty. Mighty. Oh, you a fine mama. Girl, you sure look good. You're my kind of woman. Look, you wouldn't be too bad yourself, if you had a bath and some fine clothes. A bath? I took a bath last Tuesday, two weeks ago. Are you finished, Peggy? Yes, Doctor. May I see the report, please? Thank you. Is everything all right, Doctor? I mean, was everything all right, Doc? Hm. Well, your blood pressure is a little high. But otherwise, you're in fine physical shape. Oh, great. That's good news. I would advise you to rest. OK. In fact, you should get plenty of rest for the last phase. For the last what? The last phase. I don't understand what he's talking about. I mean, what? What are you talking about. "for the last phase"? Man, you act like I'm gonna die or something. Nothing, man, nothing. Just-- just imagine you're going to a birthday party. OK. I got it. You got what? I got the key to your home. Come on, let's go home. Home? You mean, you weren't kidding when you told me I had a home? I don't ever kid. Come on, let's go home. For real? You're not kidding me? Don't forget, tomorrow, 10:00 AM. He'll be there, Doc. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Listen, we'll see y'all in the morning. I'm gonna get that bath, too, baby. Come on, you're gonna get everything you need. Bye. Take care, my man. Tomorrow, 10:00 AM. Boy, that Bob, he is something else. He sure in the hell is, Doctor. But you know, it's one thing that bothers me. What the hell did he mean about "all of the extras"? I-- I've really got something for you. You've got a surprise for me? You ready? [CLAPS HANDS] God damn! Shit, brah! Hooey. Damn, shit, man. Hooey! Like that? You damn right I like that! Come here, baby. Come here. - Damn. - Come here. Sit down, Steve. Sit down. Woo, shit, man. Damn, man. Listen, listen. Sister, I'll tell you what I want you to do. Listen to me, baby. I want you to give-- this is my man here. And I want you to give him everything he wants, when he wants it, how he wants it, where he wants it, any damn time he thinks he wants it. But Bob, now let me tell you one thing. Now, you make sure this broad don't think that I'm some peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia now. Get that out of your goddamn mind. Peanut farmer? You-- you make sure you tell him that I'm not a little snotty nosed girl from the boondocks. Oh, I think you're gonna be in good hands, my man. Yeah, I believe so, too, man. But listen, you gotta tell me about it in the morning. You sure look out for a nigga. I gotta give you credit there. But you gotta tell me about that in the morning. I got to go. You got to split? I got to go. I got business to take care of. Man, you sure is a nice dude. Listen, I'm gonna pick you up at 9:30 sharp in the morning. I'll be ready. I'll be waiting for you. All right. Take care of him, baby. Thanks a lot, brother. That's a nice dude. I ain't never met nobody that treated me so nice. Yeah, Bob's real hip. He told me to take good care of you, too. Well, you're qualified, baby. I'm telling you. Let's get you comfortable and get you out of these clothes here. Yeah, I wanna get out of these clothes, anyway. I want you nice and comfortable. Yeah, goddamn, baby. Wooey! Shit, let me get this. Yeah. Now, big daddy, little momma wants you to tell me exactly what you want. You mean I can get anything I want? Everything you want. I'm gonna tell you what I want, baby. I've been wanting this ever since I left Georgia. Ever since I left Georgia, baby. Woo! There's one thing I've been wanting. I want in the worst way. Well, let me know what it is. Can I have it right here on the couch? You can have it anywhere you want it. Right here? Anywhere you want it. Baby, since I left Georgia, let me tell you something. I've been wanting-- I've been wanting. I've been-- hoo, I want so bad! I want me some pigeon-peas, rice, and barbecued chicken. Pigeon beans, and rice, and barbecued chicken? Uh-huh. Let me get you something to eat. I can have this man ready in two days, but not before. That's fine, Doctor. Then we can pull the job by Friday. Good. Oh, baby, you talking about something good? Mm! This sure is good. [INAUDIBLE] You got anymore hot sauce? Yeah, sure. Do you want some more peas and rice? I want some more of this beer. I love the bull. Bring on the bull! Bring on the bull. You know what, dear? I never in my life believe a little woman like you, a woman who looks so good and smells so good, I never thought you could cook this good! This is a [INAUDIBLE]. You can really burn! My mama taught me well, you know. Well, I always pictured them big, big women to be the cooks, goddamn it. Little women can do that, too. I believe y'all can do a lot of things. Sure. Yeah? Yes. But I tell you what, I can't eat no more food. I got [INAUDIBLE] You want another beer? No, the only thing I want now is-- you know what I'd like? You see that back room there? I'd like to go in that shower and take me a good, hot bath. But I got one problem. One hang up. I hope-- I hope you don't mind me mentioning this to you. You've been so nice to me, darling, but when I was a little boy, like all the other kids' mama used to wash their back. My mama used to wash my butt. I got the prettiest, cleanest butt in the world. And every time I get in the shower, I don't want nobody to wash my back. I want a butt washing. Damn, baby, I don't want your apron, your uniform, or your drawers to get wet. Steve, you are too much. You wash my butt, and I'll wash yours. Hey, now. Ah, baby, come on, come on. Let's go on in and get real wet. You ready for it, baby? Yeah, I'm ready. Peggy, we must find the neutralizer. Otherwise, this mouse will die in 24 hours. Yes, Doctor. I'm trying to get that together now. Do your best. Thank you. Come on, wash my butt! It's butt-washing time! Butt-washing time! Woman, I said, wash my butt, not my back! Nigga, wait, goddamn it! Anytime a man get in a hurry, he ain't do shit. Oh, baby, this water feels so good! Doggone it! This is a big, big fucking deal. [INAUDIBLE] I just wish my old buddy Rufus was here. Rufus? Who's Rufus? Yeah, Rufus is a nigga that lived in my town. This nigga was the dirtiest nigga in town. This nigga would be taking a bath, and then he'd turn around and fart, and then he'd turn around, baby, and bite the bubbles. [LAUGHTER] Come on in here. woman. Let's have some fun! Sweetie, I'm gonna tell you something. I never, never, never thought I'd be living like a king this bright sunny day. Are you really happy, Steve? Am I happy? I feel like Superman instead of the wild man. [LAUGHTER] You know what? I have a confession to make to you, too. Tell me about it. When you walked in that door this afternoon, I never dreamed I'd feel so much for you. Well, I'm gonna tell you something. I got a way of making a woman feel for me. You know, before I got down on my luck, I was a player. I used to make my money making love to white women. You did? Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, about two weeks ago, a white woman walked up to me and said, "wild man, I'll give you $50 if you knock me out." I screwed her three times and then I hit her in the head with a brick. [LAUGHTER] I'd have shot the bitch if they'd promised me $100. [LAUGHTER] Steve, you're the greatest. Oh, when you say I'm the greatest, baby, I'm here to show you that I'm the greatest. Oh, honey, check me out! My God, you are greatest. Come on, and check me out. How are we doing? Fine, fine. Oh, let me take a look here. Put the light out, Steve. I do not like to make love in the dark. I don't know why all you broads want to turn the light out all the time. Because it's more romantic like that. Oh, baby, I ain't no blind man. I wanna see what I'm doing. I wanna see who I'm making love to. Well, all I know is that the darkness just makes me a little more sexy. Well, if that's the case, I'll turn the light off. But I'm gonna tell you something, baby. You better count to three, 'cause I count that light out. When I cut it out, I am ready. I am ready to get it on. So get ready. It's our time now, baby. Oh? Oh, no, we gonna get it on now. Oh, Steve, don't do it! Oh, Steve, don't! Oh, Steve! Oh! Do you realize that it is 10:15 already, and Steve is not here yet? I wonder what in the hell is keeping them! Don't worry, Doctor. They'll be here real soon. Good morning, everybody! Morning. Hello, Jimmy! Morning. Hello, Doctor! Good morning. Ah! [LAUGHTER] - Steve. Yeah! You seem to be in such a good mood today. Good mood? [LAUGHTER] That's the half of it, thanks to my man, Bob. Bob really looked out for your buddy Steve. Oh, man, he really looked out for me! Oh, man, only the best. Gives me the greatest. I'm glad that you had nothing but the best and the greatest last night. But now we must proceed with the examination. Doctor, as good as I feel, anything you say, it's OK. Good morning, Steve. Hello. How you feeling this morning? Well, what's come over you? [LAUGHTER] I can't tell you, but my man makes sure that I get the best! Peggy, this right here is the greatest. Oh, I can't tell you, but thanks to Bob, everything is super. All right, all right. Now we must get down to business. I want you to follow Peggy and take off your clothes for your examination. Doctor, let me tell you something. Anything you say! Very well. It's OK. All right, Doctor. Boy, you're all right. [LAUGHTER] Boy, you're all right. That's my man! That's pretty, baby. Doc, how's my man? Much better today. We can start the injections tomorrow. Good. I know he'll do fine, 'cause that hooker I got for him last night played the part of a maid perfectly. What? I want that girl fired! Steve must be in top physical condition. These shots are taking a lot out of him. Oh, hell, Doc. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, but don't worry. I'll call and tell her not to show tonight, OK? Good. I'm sending Peggy to the apartment tonight. There are certain things I want her to take care of. Steve must start getting his vitamin boosters regularly, and I want Peggy there to make sure that he gets them. I want him in top physical shape for tomorrow. That's a good idea, 'cause I'm sure Peggy won't harm him no kind of way, 'cause tell you the honest truth, I think the bitch is funny, 'cause every time I hit on her, she goes off into some sort of funny thing. Hey, you're not the only one. That makes two of us. Correction, three of us. That's a pretty ring, like you're a pretty girl. Hello, darling. Could I give you two a ride to the apartment? There's no need to go out of your way. I have my car. Well, then you do know where the place is located. Look, man, I know where he live. I know where she live. I know where you live. I even know where I live. I appreciate your hospitality, but thank you, thank you. Thank you, Jim, but I'll take mama home. She got her own car. And we going together, right, baby? OK, if you feel safe that way. I feel comfortable that way. I'd rather have it that way. You got the keys, darling? Yes. OK, let's go. Steve. Yes? Remember, get plenty of rest, and nothing to eat after midnight. I don't understand what he means, nothing to eat after midnight. That's what the doctor said. That's right. That's what I said. Nothing to eat after midnight. Well, guess I can't have nothing to eat after midnight. See you tomorrow. See you. See you, Jim. OK. OK, Steve. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I'll see you later. OK. Goodbye, Steve. I know, nothing. Nothing to eat after midnight. That's right. STEVE: Nothing to eat after midnight. See you, Doc. You know, I don't understand this. I hope this will work, but I am just not sure. What's wrong, Doc? Well, I-- I try to work so hard, and I'm trying to do it in the name of science. But-- but this-- but this clown, I-- I just-- I just don't know. Doc, don't worry, OK? Just don't worry. Say, maybe-- maybe we should have something to drink. You know something? That is a very good idea. Tell you what I'll do. Why don't I fix the two of us a Martini? Hey, that is very good. That's very good. But make mine a vodka Martini. You got it. OK, let's go. Come on in, sweetie. Come on in. Welcome to my little castle. Home sweet home. Oh, you have a nice place here. Yeah, well, we kind of like it. It's kind of groovy, and we've got a few pieces of art that we kind of dig a little bit. That's one of my pieces there, that we picked up over in Africa. Oh, it's quite nice. Yeah, something really different. But you talking about something different, check out my get high tree. My get high tree. If you had some paper, I'd roll you a joint right now. Oh, but isn't it illegal to smoke marijuana? Illegal to smoke marijuana because of the system. The system says it's illegal to smoke marijuana. But when you check it out, the system's wrong. The system says it's illegal to smoke marijuana, yet it's still the same system say it's OK for two grown men to have sex together. So that means if you are caught with a joint in your mouth, you better make sure it has two balls on the end of it. [LAUGHTER] It kind of-- it kind of woke you up a little bit. I know that woke you up. That'll kind of get you, so you can relax in my home. But the one thing that you haven't had a chance to see is the fun room. The bedroom. I want you to check out the bedroom, baby! Wait a minute. Let me set you straight. I'm a professional. You're a what? I'm a professional. You mean to tell me you're a hooker? No, I'm a nurse and a laboratory technician. I know what a nurse is, but what-- what does a lab technician do? How about administering the technical things? I've tried a little bit of everything. I might as well try some of that. Can we try some right now? Uh, it's time for your pill. Can you tell me where I can get some water? Oh, some water. Oh. Oh, right here in the kitchen. Just right over there. See over there? Thank you. OK, sweetie. You'll find it right up there, the hot and the cold water. If you're gonna give me a pill, bring me some cold water, damn it. PEGGY: All right. OK. Steve! Yes, I'm just getting comfortable, so that we can enjoy ourselves up here. Well, I mean, there's nothing wrong with being cool, now. Come on, look. I'm here to do one thing, and that's to take care of you. I believe that. I know, and you're qualified. I told them to send me a qualified person. I told them, don't send me no gorilla. Don't send me no faggot. Don't send me no bull dyke. Well, look. Suppose-- oh, I know what's happening. You're one of them women that likes women. One of them damn bull dykes. That's what you are, huh? Wait a minute. I think you got it all wrong. Well, look, I'm only guessing. I'm just taking a guess. Well, tell me this. Where do you live at? I live at 1012 Northwest 74th Street. Oh, I got it figured out now. You've got a sponsor, 'cause it costs money to live in that neighborhood, with swimming pools and tennis courts and all the other jazz. That's what's happening, huh? No, I make enough money at the lab with Dr. Dippy. You make that kind of bread? Well, that's super. Well, this has got to be my lucky day. You ain't got nobody. I ain't got nobody. Hey, baby, come here! [LAUGHTER] Wait a minute. Come here, come here! Wait a minute. You gotta get your rest, be strong for our experiment tomorrow. Man, you act like a karate expert instead of some lab technician. Experiment tomorrow? That's right. Experiment when? Tomorrow. Experiment when? Huh? Experiment when? [LAUGHTER] Huh? Experiment when? We're not gonna experiment tomorrow, baby. Uh-uh. No, sir, baby. We're gonna experiment right now. Goddamn! Baby, woo! Oh, you are the greatest. Mercy. Woo. God. Come on, baby. Let's go in the bedroom and get it on right now, right now! Steve, I'm afraid. Afraid of what, baby? I ain't gonna hurt nothing as fine as you. Shoot, no. You don't have to worry about nothing. Uh-uh. No, don't worry, baby. I ain't gonna hurt you. What are you afraid of? I'm a virgin. You're a what? A virgin. A virgin? Oh, shit. God damn it. This is my lucky day. I got me a cherry! That's what worries me. Oh, no, baby. You don't have to worry. Shit, come on. Take this shit off right now. - Wait a minute. - Come on. I can't get this thing off. - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. You got this little-- No, that's OK. Look, you gotta unbutton it. OK, let me do something. Shit. Oh, baby. Oh, baby! Oh, oh, baby. I can't-- I can't wait, baby. Oh, baby, shit now! Oh, shit, now take your drawers off. Take your drawers off. No, you take yours off. I'll take mine off. Take yours off. I'll take mine off. Come on, girl. Take your clothes off. Goddamn it, get naked, get naked! But Steve, I'm afraid! Bitch, it's too late to be afraid now! All right, all right, Steve. I'll take my clothes off. Say, man, suppose he's wanted by the police. Oh, the police don't want that nigga, man. I don't even believe his mama wants him. Aw, Peggy, welcome to the club. But Steve, I'm still afraid. Oh, darling, don't be afraid. After all, I'm not gonna hurt you. I wouldn't hurt you for nothing in the world. Oh, Peggy, just look at your titties. Every time I look at your titties, they remind me of windshield wipers. Windshield wipers? Oh, windshield wipers! Oh, Peggy. Peggy, come here, baby. Come here. Let me relax with mama. Let me relax with you, Peggy. Oh, Peggy, don't be afraid. Look at all this. Oh, Peggy. Peggy, come on, get in this bed, baby. Come on, get in this bed, baby. Peggy, come on get in this bed, Peggy. What are you waiting for, Peggy? Come on. Come on, Peggy. Get in this bed, Peggy. Peggy, get in the bed. Come on, baby. Oh, Peggy. At last, Peggy. Oh, fuck, my eye! Oh, stop making excuses. Let's dance. You almost put out my eye. Well, why don't you look where you're going? [COUGHING] What's the matter now? I need air. I need air. Peggy, turn that damn light out, baby. Turn the light off? Yeah, turn it off. This is my first time. I wanna see what's going on. I thought you'd enjoy it better, baby, with the light out. Well, if you promise not to hurt me, I'll turn it out. I promise, baby. Just turn it out, please? Steve? Yes. Don't hurt me. Steve? Yeah? Please don't hurt me. What you mean, don't hurt you, Peggy? Don't hurt me. What do you mean, don't hurt you? That ring you have on your finger. Peggy, that ain't a ring on my finger, baby? Then what is it? That's the watch on my wrist. What are you doing in that ridiculous outfit? I have just come from the sauna, darling. My dear, you keep going back to that sauna, and you're gonna lose what little you have left. You seem to be very happy with what little I have left. Hmm. Let's talk about something else. Why don't we play a little, uh, chess? Chess? No, I just-- I couldn't concentrate. I have too many things on my mind about tomorrow. Well, I know tomorrow is your big day, but chess is a big game to concentrate. It's purposely made out for that. Ah, OK. I will give it a try. What the hell. All right, I made my first move already. Oh, I can see you're not in the mood for this. I'll tell you what. I told you. Sit over here, and I'll rub your back. Hm. I'd rather you rubbed something else. My dear, when I get my diamond pasties, you will get a complete massage. But in the meantime, you get over here, I will give you a shoulder rub. And that's all you're gonna get for now. Monica, darling. What, dear? Will you hand me one of my cigars, please? Oh, I wish you'd stop smoking. Don't you know, smoking stunts your growth? I think it is a little bit too late for that. Oh, you are just hopeless. Well, here you are. Thank you. You know, Monica, darling, within less than 24 hours, I will have over $10 million worth of diamonds right in these hands. I wonder how many diamonds it's gonna take to make up my pasties. Oh, I don't really care. As many of you want. Can I also have a new car? Of course. Because you are the only one that I'm going to split with. Oh, darling, you're the only one that understands me so. That's why I love you. Oh, don't tell me that. You just love me for my body. I love you. By the way, what time it is? It's only 10 minutes after 12:00. Boy, I sure hope that Steve remembers my instructions. I distinctly told him, nothing to eat after midnight. Nothing to eat after midnight. Oh, Lord! Oh, Jesus! Oh, Steve! Steve, do you think you're gonna be all right tomorrow for the experiment? After all, the doctor did say you weren't supposed to eat anything after midnight. I don't think he meant this. I can't believe the time is finally here. In just a few hours, we will all be millionaires. Yeah, I'll tell you, ain't nothing can go wrong now. But what if-- He will be here, and the plan is perfect, Doc! No time for conversation, Peggy. Just take Steve in the back. Steve, please follow me. OK. I guess this is a great day for science. Hey, let's hope it's a great day for all of us to become millionaires. But I am doing it for science. But we are doing it for the bread. How can you think of money at a time like this? Easy. Now I go to perform my final act. Success. Oh, what a night! Baby, woo! You've made me the happiest man in the world. You are a super, super girl. You know how to make a man feel good. Oh, baby. Did you enjoy yourself last night? Yes, darling. Well, Steve, are you ready? Uh, ready for what, Doctor? Oh, this is the big day, Steve. Will you take off your coat, please? OK. I don't mind. I don't mind, Doctor. I don't mind taking off my coat. Yes, indeed. Everything seems to be going like y'all promised. I had such a good time last night. I'm in such a good, good, good, good, good mood. What are you getting ready to do, Doctor? Will you please drop your pants and bend over? Drop my pants and bend over? That's right. I mean, what for? What are you getting ready to do? I'm going to give you a shot in the butt. A shot in the butt? That's right. But, Doctor, most of the time, they shoot you in the arm. Why? Why? Why do you wanna shoot me in my butt? Because it's easier for me to reach! Will you bend over, please? OK, Doctor. Now, you're not gonna hurt me, are you? No. You're sure? I am positive. Just bend over, please. Now, don't hurt me now, Doctor. Peggy? Doctor, don't hurt me! You won't feel a thing. STEVE: Ow! Is he a monster? Is he a wild man? Is the nigga crazy? Hell no. He's just what I spent my $6,000 for. I've got myself a $6,000 nigga. How do you feel, Steve? How do you feel? I feel good! I feel good! I feel good! Peggy, get me that iron bar. What's going on? Nothing, man. It's heavy. It looks heavy. Here, what do you want me to do with it? I want you to bend it. Are you crazy? Bend it. I don't know if I can bend this thing. I'll try. [CLANG] Samson ain't got shit on me! Man, like I could kick King Kong's black ass. Say, Steve. Yeah. Since you're so damn strong, come over here and lift this iron safe. Lift this iron safe. Go ahead. Sir? Go ahead, lift it. I'll try. Look at this shit. Shit! That safe weighs 2,000 pounds! I don't believe it! Goddamn it, what's going on? Say, Bob, just to satisfy this guy, we'd better make that stop. Listen, man, we've only got five hours. Now, I still got to give you the instructions. Listen, you got 10 minutes, OK? 10 minutes to kick their asses, and then I'll-- then you've got to get right back in the car. 10 minutes, and then we've got to go, OK? That's all I need, baby. Just 10 minutes. 10 minutes to put my foot in their ass. That's all I need. Then it's settled. Good luck, Steve, and hurry back. OK, man. I appreciate that. I don't it's gonna be that long. Well, let's get out of here. OK, all right. Whatever you say, it's OK. Yeah, man. They opened that new climax club down there on 22nd Avenue. Oh, yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, they said membership for the broads is $10. Yeah? And then for the fellas, it's-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Hey, man. Look at this shit here. [LAUGHTER] [SCREAMING] I got him. It's my motherfucking arm, man. He's breaking my goddamn motherfucking arm. Cut it loose! Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Told y'all I was gonna get your ass. Don't-- don't kill me, man. I told y'all I was gonna get your ass! I told y'all I was gonna get your ass! Don't kill me, man! I told y'all I was gonna get your-- Anybody make a mistake. Make a mistake? Make a mistake, goddamn it? This is your last mistake! [SCREAMING] It's your last one! Don't move, nigga! Don't move! Man, please, please, please, don't hurt me, man! You done killed both of these goddamn niggas. Ain't that enough, man? All over that freaking newspaper? Everything? Please, man! Come on, nigga! Come here, nigga! I'm telling you to come here! [CHUCKLING] Steve, you sure took care of business. [LAUGHTER] You see that nigga run? Yeah, you kicked ass. [LAUGHTER] Listen. Now, you done took care of your business. Now I want you to come on and take care of mine. Anything you say, Bob. Come on. Let's get the hell outta here. Get in the car. Let's go. Come on, let's go. [CAR STARTING] Now, wait just a minute, just a minute, man. Just a minute. What is this? What is it you guys want me to do? It's all a practical joke. See, the owners of this jewelry store, we're gonna play a joke on them. We're gonna take the safe out of the store without them knowing it. Of course, we're going to return it in a few days. Now, Bob, let me tell you something. The last time a nigga tried something like that, the police fired two warning shots in his black ass, and then they hollered "halt!" Now, Bob, why? Man, tell me why? Why in the hell do you wanna try for me to take that same? Ain't gonna be no shooting. This-- this is different, see. We wanna sell this store some equipment, see? Stop some of these niggas from breaking in and stealing these white folks' jewelry. See, and we can prove that the store is not secure the way it is now, they'll buy the equipment, and we make a whole lot of money. That's great, Bob. After all, man, you've been super, super nice to me. OK, I'll go along with it. We'll give it a try. All you got to do is pretend like you're buying some jewelry. The best in the joint. Now, you're gonna have to look like you can afford the best, like me. See, so go on and get changed, so we can go on and take care of this business. Man, I still don't understand how in the hell am I gonna take a big safe out of the store with all them people and nobody seeing me! Don't you worry about that. I've got it all worked out. I'll explain to you while you're getting dressed. All right, now, you better explain this. Hey, remember that guy that walked in the store the other day? Yeah? The tall, really good-looking one with blond hair? Yeah, do I remember him. The one looking at you? I saw him the other day. He asked me out. He did? Hello. May I help you? Yes, you can. You can help me. Are you looking for anything specific today? Without a doubt. You know what I'd like to have, sweetie? What's that? You look like the type of lady that can help me. I'd like to have a nice, nice present for my lady. A nice present. Something different, no doubt. Right, right, right. That's it. A charm for her bracelet. No, I don't want no charm. A watch? A watch. Now that sounds like a winner. Gold? Well, let me see. Show it to me. Come this way, please. Show it to me, please, if you don't mind. We've got some beautiful ladies watches right over here. Good afternoon. Hello. May I help you? Yes, uh, we are looking for rings. Rings? What kind of rings? Wedding rings. Oh, wedding rings. Congratulations. When's the date? Very soon. Next month. Gosh, that's great. Let's see, now. What kind of wedding rings are you looking for? Well, we've got plain bands, some engraved bands. Something-- something that is not too expensive. Diamonds. Diamonds. Hey, listen, I have this beautiful ring-- Diamonds? --I think you'll like. Let me get it for you. Let me see what she's got to show. Diamonds are expensive. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Ah, that's right. Yes, but not mine. But not mine. Let me show you this ring. Oh, my goodness. Look at it. That's just exactly what I want. That-- that looks too expensive. You haven't even looked at it. I've looked at it! I've seen it. It's too expensive. You don't even know how much it costs. I can tell by looking at it. This ring costs $1,000. Gosh. Sir, I have just the watch for you. Well, let me see it. Let me see it. The finest watch in the whole store. Would you like to try it on? Yes. No, no, no, no. I-- I think you-- you better show her something less expensive. Well, it's really not that expensive. And it looks so beautiful on her hand. No, no. I-- I am sorry. This is the one I want. Let me look at it under the light here. It looks lovely. Look, it's beautiful. No, no, no, no. Look at it. No. What do you mean, no? No! You're so cheap. I am not cheap. Well, you are so. No. It's only $1,000. Oh, baby, now, that's what I call a watch! That-- look at the diamonds in it. Isn't that beautiful? Notice the filigree leaf. MONICA: You are cheap. - Can you-- DIPPY: What do you mean, cheap? - Can you-- can you put my-- DIPPY: Don't give me that cheap. - Can you put my lady's name? MONICA: You are so cheap. DIPPY: I am not cheap. Excuse me just a moment. DIPPY: No way am I cheap. That's $1,000 too much. Excuse me. Is there something wrong here? DIPPY: Nothing is wrong. This is a private argument. Well, everything seems to be OK. Would you like to try on something different? Yes. I don't want anything different. Yes. This is the one I want. It's really a very lovely ring. If that is the one you want, you buy it yourself. Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my darling. My darling, speak to me. Speak to me. Blanche, Blanche, come here. She's fainted. Help. Oh, no. Lift her feet up. Perhaps that'll help. Here, I'll take her pulse. Maybe we ought to loosen her clothing. DIPPY: Yeah, yeah. I will do that. I will do that. WOMAN: No, you don't. This is a respectable store. I don't think the boss would allow it. DIPPY: I am sorry. I am sorry. Uh, call-- call an ambulance. Call an ambulance. OK. WOMAN: Let's see. Your pulse looks OK. Yes, can I have an ambulance sent to Main Street Jewelers, please? Hurry, it's an emergency. One of our customers has fainted. Thank you. DIPPY: Speak. Speak to me. Speak to me, please? WOMAN: Oh, she looks like she's gone to me. DIPPY: Oh, no. Bob, what are we stopping here for? Never mind that. Come on. I want you to get the safe out of the trunk. Come on, put it on the ground. OK! Open it up. But Bob, it's locked. Tear the damn thing open, man. We made you the strongest man in the world. Come on, you can do it. All right, if you say so, I'll open it. I'll open it. Got it, we got it! Well, what are you gonna do with them? What are you gonna do with them? Never mind that. Come on, I want you to get rid of this safe for me. Come on, hurry up! All right, all right, all right! Come on, man! Come on! All right, come on, hurry it up. Hurry, man, hurry! How can a man be so strong and yet be so damn slow? Holding up my progress here. Getting me a new Cadillac, anyway. Come on, man. Hurry it up, man. Man, we ain't got all day. Get on over here! Bob, what the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, Steve, but you see, this is a robbery, not a practical joke. You see, there was over $10 million worth of diamonds in that safe, and I got them right here. So now you wanna shoot me? You're gonna kill me? Think of it this way. I'm just closing your contract with death, you see, because you were gonna die in six days, anyway. What are you talking about? You see, that experiment that was performed on you has one fatal aftereffect. You see, you die in exactly one week. Peggy and the Doctor were trying to discover some sort of neutralizer that would counter that effect, but you see, we just didn't have enough time. We had to get these diamonds. You're a no good son of a bitch! [CHUCKLING] That's just what my mama used to call me. I think I'm gonna shoot you in your face, because I don't wanna mess up that suit I just bought you. [GUNSHOTS] Goddamn, this nigga is bulletproof! Ow! Peggy. Peggy. Goddamn, where that woman could be? Peggy! Peggy! What the hell happened to you? Well, it's that-- that goddamn nigga Steve! He's bulletproof! What the hell you mean, bulletproof? I tried to shoot him, but the-- but the bullets bounced right off his black ass. Well, have you got the diamonds? - No. - You what? No. You don't have the diamonds? He's got 'em. But don't worry. Don't worry, don't worry. That's all you've been saying since we started this shit, and look what it's gotten us! Don't worry. Steve will bring 'em back. Well, how will he bring 'em back? He'll bring 'em back in exchange for the neutralizer. See-- see, I told him that he was gonna die in six days if he didn't get the neutralizer you and Peggy was working on, Doc. But we don't have the neutralizer! We know that, Doc, but Steve doesn't. [DOOR CLOSES] Who was that? That was Peggy. Huh? Peggy, baby, am I glad to see you. Honey, what's wrong? Oh, baby, what-- what-- what's that you got there? Wait. Be careful, be careful. This could save your life. Come on, quick, get inside. OK. Peggy, that nigga's crazy. That motherfucker was trying to kill me. Shit. That motherfucker's crazy. Ain't no [INAUDIBLE] like that. Steve. Steve, I have something I've got to say. Say it! Say it! Shit, I feel like I'm dying, goddamn it. I know. I overheard them talking. You know you only have six days to live? Six days? You mean-- I'm not gonna sit around here six days till I die. I'm going to the lab. I'm gonna find that little short motherfucker, kick his ass, and get that neutralizer. You can't. That's exactly what they want you to do, so they can trick you into giving up the diamonds for the neutralizer! They don't even have the neutralizer! What? You mean to tell me they don't have no neutralizer? We have the main ingredients, but in what amounts, I don't know. It could take months, even years to get this thing right. You mean to tell me you think, girl, I'm gonna sit on my black ass and just sit here and die? What's all that shit you got on there, anyway? Look, after I heard all I needed to know-- Yeah, what happened? --I grabbed the compounds for the neutralizer. Uh-huh. And I left the lab without anyone seeing me. Uh-huh. Yeah. You mean to tell me, you can make the-- the neutralizer out of that stuff? Yes, but-- But? Give me that stuff! Steve, what are you gonna do? I'm not gonna sit here and commit suicide. I'm going to do something. I'm not-- if I'm gonna die, damn it-- if I'm gonna die, girl, I'm gonna die trying! Well, get out of the way. I don't wanna die. Ain't nobody-- nobody gonna put them flowers on my grave. I do not wanna die! Lord, I wanna go to heaven, but I don't wanna die. Oh, no, no, no. Them honkies done messed me up! Eenie, meenie, minie, moe, this nigga's not ready to go! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. I just don't wanna die. I got too much to live for! Oh, shit, goddamn it! Shit, God! [MUMBLING] I'll drink this shit. Oh, my god! Oh, goddamn it, I got it. I believe I got the formula! Steve, don't drink that stuff! I'm gonna drink this shit! If it's not white, it's not a neutralizer. Peggy, it's turning! It's a miracle. Steve, you found the neutralizer! Wee, I feel good! Woo! I feel good! Woo, I feel good! I knew you would! I feel good. All right, cut the bullshit. We want the diamonds. Nigga, I don't know nothing about no diamonds. Look, if you want this bitch alive, then give up the diamonds. Look, man, that girl didn't do nothing to you. Why don't you leave that girl alone? Look, we're not kidding. If you want this bitch alive, then give up the diamonds. Believe me, my friend, he is not kidding. Oh, I see you have the compounds. I can make the neutralizer for you, Steve. Of course, in exchange for the diamonds. Steve has already taken the neutralizer. In the name of science, how did you do it, Peggy? Well, you can give the credit to Steve. All he did was mix the compounds together, and he drank it down. But-- but I don't understand! We've been working on it for weeks! Listen, let's cut the bullshit and get to the point. Man, I'll tell you where the diamonds are, if you-- if you just leave us alone. Where are they? Man, they're close to the spot where we hit the safe. Well, listen, let's go. And you remember one thing. You may be bulletproof, but your woman ain't. All right, baby. Just-- just take it easy, man. Come on, baby. We-- we'll go with them. Come on. These guys are crazy. Bunch of nuts. But Dr. Dippy, where are you taking us? Do not worry about it. Just get going. - Aw, come on. Get the lead out of your ass. Move. Come on. Hey, man, don't hurt this girl. Let's move, man. Let's move! Get your honky hands off me. All right, Steve, you get out on that side. All right. All right, move. All right. Move, nigga! Peggy, out! You heard the man. Get your ass on over there. Come on! Move! All right, Steve, where are the diamonds? I'm not sure, man. I'm not sure! You're not sure? No! I forgot! What do you mean, you forgot? When I gave you superhuman powers, I also gave you a super memory. You cannot forget! Listen, Steve, if you play games with us, we'll have to kill her. Don't move, don't move! Any slight movement of my hand could set this trigger off. All right, man. All right. Don't hurt-- don't hurt the girl. Don't-- don't hurt Peggy. Look, look. I'll get you the diamonds, but remember one thing. If you hurt her, I'm still bulletproof, and I'll find you sometime, someplace, somewhere. You've got yourself a deal, brother. We don't wanna hurt your woman. All we want is the damn diamonds! All right. Don't hurt the girl. Don't-- don't-- don't hurt her, please, please. I'll get the diamonds. I'll get the diamonds. I'll get the diamonds. You two wait for me in the car. [GUNSHOT] What the-- I thought you were doing this in the name of science. Do not be stupid, boy. I was doing it for the money, same as you. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] It's all over, Peggy. Let's go. WOMAN: Mama don't know what it is. BOY: Hey. Hey, baby, you know what it is? WOMAN: Why, no. I don't know what it is. BOY: Somebody's got to know something. I don't know where it comes from. I don't know where it goes. Spider-man, can you help me? Got to know. I've got to know. Robin, tell Batman, I need him now. I know he can help me, somehow, somehow. I'm scared. Something's creeping around here. I don't know what. Last night, it woke me from my sleep. It must be something awful. It got big feet. It walks so hard. It talks real loud. Maybe I need Wonder Woman to get the answer for me. Maybe the Hardy Boys can solve this mystery, this mystery. Miss, you saw it. What is it? WOMAN: I'm sorry, young man, but I don't know what it is. BOY: Hey. Hey, Mister, do you know what it is? MAN: Do I know what it is? It is what it is. That's what it is. BOY: I asked my friend Joe. Hey. Hey, Joe. Do you know what it is? JOE: I don't know, man. I don't know nothing, man. BOY: I asked my grandma. Grandma, can you tell me what it is? WOMAN: It's a nigga!
