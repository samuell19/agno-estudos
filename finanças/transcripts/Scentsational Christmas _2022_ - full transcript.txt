♪ Na na na na na na na na ♪ ♪ It's Christmastime ♪ Ellie, in case you hadn't noticed, there is a Christmas party happening all around you. Ah. Sorry. Thank you. I just... I love the Christmas tree, these candle ornaments in particular. They're beautiful. Yeah. Nastia had them flown in from Germany. My mom hung similar ornaments growing up. It always made Christmas feel so special. Well, maybe this Christmas will be made special by your, um, Parisian promotion? It's not a done deal. I mean, Nastia hasn't even selected the new fragrance yet. Oh, come on. Yours is testing through the roof. Who's your competition? Eric? Look at him! He's dressed like a... movie theatre usher. Wow. He's really kissing up to Nastia. Oh, we can't have that. Let's, uh... let's go wish them merry Christmas. Oh, uh... Svetlana, come over here for a sec. Eric! Eric, uh, Svetlana here was looking for the, uh, Rudolph candy cane bar, And he knows where it is. He knows. So why don't you show her, because you know where it is? Um, Nastia. - Yeah. - We were just admiring these beautiful ornaments that you've generously flown in... from Europe. Thank you, Andrew! I'm so glad you noticed them. Aren't they just divine? You know, I actually completely forgot I ordered them. Sir-endipity. Yes. Yes. It's, uh, s-serendipity, I think is what you meant to say. I mean, they're so elegant for Christmas, Nastia. Ah. I love Christmas, the gifts especially. Right. Uh, well, speaking of gifts, we were just wondering maybe, uh, if you've decided to choose your new scent? Not yet. I will before Christmas. I hear they're testing really well. - Oh. - Maybe we have a Christmas reveal party. Much bigger. Glitter cannons. A balloon drop. Oh, my gosh. We can get Santa to spray next year's holiday scent all over the crowd. Y-Yeah. You know what? I mean, this is a party, and, uh, it's Christmas, so you could just reveal it right here. It's the perfect venue. Really good time to... No, it's not... big enough, but, um, next week. Just contact my assistant, okay? Merry Christmas. Merry... Christmas. M-Merry Christmas. And she's off. Yeah. Don't worry. I am going to stay on her. Even if I have to put it in skywriting, I will be on it. Andrew, please. The work is done. Our scent is submitted. If you stress, I will stress. You're right. You're right. I... I don't want to do that, because you don't need any more stress. You've been working so many hours, late nights. Uh, where are you going again? New Hampshire? - Is that, like, on purpose? - My dad is expecting me. It's our first Christmas without my mom, so... Oh. Oh. Sorry. Well, couldn't he, you know, come to you? No. He runs our family business, a candle shop, and Christmas is the busy season. I... I think he needs my help. Right. Of course. Well, it must be less stressful than working for Nastia. I don't know. Dad has just about as many photos of himself around the house, without the thigh-high boots and he's holding up fish, but... Really? Somehow, I think I'd prefer that. Anyway, um, enjoy yourself tonight. I will keep tabs on Nastia, and maybe we'll get a Parisian Christmas present for you? Santé to that. Santé? Oh. It's French. Right. Cheers. Au revoir. Hi there. Are you here to pick up an order? No. Um... Oh. Well, then you have excellent taste. Those candles are made by the owner himself. Yeah. The last candle-maker in a long line - of specialized craftsmen. - Specialized? Rumor has it the family's been here for over 100 years, descendants of elves. - Elves? - Oh, yeah. Left the North Pole for a better life. You know, Santa's great and all, but who wouldn't want to be their own boss? - Mm. - They passed down their excellent craftsmanship from the workshop through the generations. You know, this cottage is said to be an exact replica of their workshop. Really? Because I always thought it was, um, Portsmouth's original schoolhouse. Well, that was before they moved in. - Oh. - Hmm. And the whole family are, uh, descendants of elves? I mean, they seem so... tall. Well, don't you think they'd have a little bit magic? They blend that into every candle. So, how many can I put you down for? Dad! Ellie! Oh, you're home! Merry Christmas. I didn't know you hired help. Huh? Oh, this is Logan Osborne. He's my first Airbnb guest. Oh, at Christmas? I thought we were going to talk before you listed. I got antsy. Besides, the more, the merrier. He's in town writing an article for Travelique Magazine. That's it. Right. Yeah. Trying to write on Christmas in New England. Well, you're in the right place. We take Christmas very seriously here in Portsmouth. And that's what I'm looking for: a unique story that only can be experienced here. Logan is an experienced storyteller. I read several of his articles, even before he became a guest. Oh. Thanks, Jamar. And the story about the family of elves was very amusing. Yeah. You know, a good story sells anything, and you got to admit. I almost had you - buying those candles. - Well, personally, I would have focused more on the candles. Speaking of, um, Dad, uh... Hmm? What's going on with these candles? I'm having trouble with the antique molds. Candles aren't turning out as well. Is everything okay? Of course. I just have to work out the kinks. Candle-making is not in my DNA like you... or your mother. The Baileys, my wife's family, they, uh, they were one of the original founders of Portsmouth. Always had a candle cottage on the property. We've upgraded over the years, but, uh... always a work in progress. That is what is so wonderful about Christmas. Everything works out. I totally agree. I mean, this article almost didn't come together, and then I found Jamar on the 11th hour. You know, I actually wanted to talk more about you. Um, Lohan? Are you a responsible person? Like, have you ever left the door unlocked or keys in the car? Stove on? Have you ever left a... Forgive her. She's always been cautious. Logan is responsible. He even loves my Christmas cocoa. You've already made him Christmas cocoa? Mm. How long have you been here? A week. But when you know, you know. Right, Jamar? We're best buds. And, um, how long does it take to write an article? Ah, well, it takes time to find my focus, and with so many things going on, it's hard to choose. But it makes life interesting. Well, break's over. I must get back to my candle-making. - I'm behind. - Well, how behind? Oh, I still have 10 orders to fill before Christmas and many more to deliver. Uh... Ah. These go to the tavern. Oh, I'll take them. Gives me an excuse to see Mindee. - Well, how can I help? - You can, um... find your focus. I'll be back soon, Dad. Nice meeting you. Bye! Mindee! Ellie! So good to see you! I'm so happy to see you. Oh. I come bearing gifts. Ah. Yes. I thought we were going to have to switch to all LEDs. Oh, that is blasphemy. Well, your dad's just been pretty backed up. Oh. Has it been that bad? You know what? Christmas can be chaotic, and he's on his own now. Stuff happens. - Sit, please. - Okay. How are you? How is the glamorous world of fragrance? Nastia's new scent? Am I an insider now? No, seriously. Does this mean that I can brag about being on the cutting edge of beauty? We'll see. I mean, I hope so. If she likes it, I'm off to Paris. What? Paris. When? What would you be doing there? Executive VP. Although part of me will miss those late nights being creative in the lab. Oh, and here I thought you were just, you know, drinking cosmos at some trendy club every night. Oh, please. I'm in bed before the clubs even open. But I do like a good cosmo, or better yet, Mindee's cider. - Hold that thought. - Oh. - I'm keeping this. - Please. It's for you. I can't believe you still do that! It's faster! Alright. My new Christmas cider. Oh! - Right? - So good. We're premiering it at the wassailing party, which, by the way, I have invited the historical society this year. It's going to be big. You have to come. I'll try, but I feel like my dad needs a lot of help. Well, you're here, and you'll be a huge help. And we are all so happy you're home for Christmas. How did you manage to get the time off? Making up for my absence last year. I didn't want him to be alone. Little did I know, he has a new best friend. Yeah, the handsome Logan Osborne. Wait. You've met him? Sure. Hey, it's big news to have a writer from Travelique in town. Also, I wanted him to mention the tavern, so I thought maybe you could bring that up. You know, give you a chance to chat. Oh, pass. I am not even going there. Yeah. Too bad about the hot man staying in your house who your dad loves. Sad. What more do you want for Christmas there, greedy? All I want for Christmas is a promotion to Paris. Eh, it's the 21st century. You can have it all. I did have it all. Not possible. Ugh. Tyler. That's ancient history. Don't let the past get in the way of your Christmas present. Well, I wish the past didn't linger in the present. But on the bright side, Tyler did teach me a valuable lesson. Never be someone's option. Amen. But you still have to at least flirt with Logan. I mean, it's Christmas. Give me something. - Mindee! - What? - Stop! - It's flirting. - I just got here. - Come on. Hey. Wait up. Are you following me? No. I'm writing. You're walking. It's all up here. Ah. I love bumping into familiar faces. It's what I love about small towns. Oh, did you grow up in a big city? Lots of them. My family moved around a lot. My dad was in the army. Oh, is that why you became a travel writer? Traveling part came easy, but I don't like to stick with one thing for too long. That's probably why I haven't written my novel. I never really had any roots, so the idea of staying in one place for too long, - it's not for me. - Mm. How about you? Your dad says you're the best at making candles. How come he's running the business and not you? Short answer: I wanted more. And as a rebellious teen, I couldn't very well follow in my mom's footsteps, even though she tried. And, uh, right after I graduated with my degree in chemistry, I got a job offer from Nastia. The supermodel? Yes. It's a big global brand. Candle-making in Portsmouth just didn't have the same appeal. But it's your family's legacy. I mean, that's special. And who knows. You could have taken it to the world stage. Probably best I didn't. My mom was a tough act to follow. She had a gift. She would always say, "One candle can defy any darkness." - Wow. That is... beautiful. - Hmm. I'm going to use that in a story someday. Thank you, Sarah Reddy. How do you know her name? Oh, your dad talks about her a lot. - It's nice. - Huh. I keep hearing about these Christmas candles. Jamar said that they started from your mom's side of the family. Yeah. The Christmas candles... I didn't see any in the workshop. Surely there must be orders for them. No idea. And-and my mom didn't start the Christmas candle tradition, but she loved the fable. Wait. You mean the folklore about the Christmas couple that were supposed to get married on Christmas Day? The groom got lost in a snowstorm, but the bride had unwavering faith, so she made candles and lit an entire evergreen to guide him home on Christmas Day. And she made a wish, right? Wow. You really do do your research. Well, there's different variations, but everyone agrees it happened. And according to my mom, the candle has a secret ingredient that, when burned on Christmas, grants wishes. That's the fairytale part. You don't believe it? Well, of course not. It's not realistic. But she did. That's why she made the candles - to honor the couple. That was her fantasy. I never got into it. Would you like a ride home? No, I'm good. I like to walk. Okay. Goodnight, Logan. Night, Ellie. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Ellie. Um, are you not making Christmas candles this year? I tried. They came out all wrong. Horrible. I-I can't figure it out. I'm missing some... key ingredient. Well, I'm sure Mom wrote it down somewhere. I looked everywhere. I was hoping you may know. No, no. We were supposed to make them together last Christmas, but... Ah. I thought I could figure it out before this Christmas. I only have that one left. Tell me the truth; how is the business doing? I... don't think it can survive till next Christmas. We lost too many orders, and the Haggerty's account... Dad, that's our biggest account. I tried to keep them, but they only want Christmas candles. Well, we can't lose Mama's legacy. Christmas would never be the same. I'll try and figure out the formula, and I'll see what I can do about finding another buyer. That would be... a Christmas miracle. I'm so glad you are home! Oh... Why don't you go to bed? I'll clean up. Okay? Goodnight, Ellie. Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh my gosh! Are you okay? - Oh... - Let's get you inside. I can't believe I slipped. You know I have cat-like reflexes. Dad, even a lion would slip on ice. Okay, this doesn't look too bad, but we should still get it checked out. It will be fine. I'm tough, and I can't afford to be out of commission. I need to keep the few orders I do have. I'll take over. But it's your vacation. It's all good. But if we're going to save this business, I need to find out that missing ingredient. Good morning. Morning. Everything okay? Yeah. I'm trying to make sense of this ordering system. My dad writes them down on whatever paper he has available. I mean, I found one order on a grocery receipt. No wonder the business is a mess. Okay, this is going to take me hours to organize, and I still have candles to make. Well, you can start simple e-com platform with an order fulfillment system. A what? Sorry, I'm a chemist, not a member of the geek squad. Don't worry about it. I'll whip something up. It's fine. You don't have to say the day. You probably have work to do. It's okay. I am not slaying dragons over here, and distraction is part of my writing process. It helps when I have writer's block. That is a strange philosophy, but I won't turn down free work. Wait, there's no pay? Um... Just kidding. Just kidding. Come on, give me those receipts. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, who's this pretty lady? That is my great-great great grandmother Abigail. My mom was obsessed with her. Why? Well, she was amazing. At the turn of the century, during the height of the Industrial Revolution, when other people were opening sweatshops, Abigail opened the manor to immigrants of all races, religions and creeds, and she gave them jobs - some at the cider mill, some making candles - with a living wage and safe working conditions. And not just a place to sleep, but to call home. Not permanent, but enough to give them a leg up in their new life. Huh. Wow, that is amazing. Right? My mom always thought the Christmas candle tradition started with her and her husband Benjamin. Wait. That's the folklore about the couple that was lost in the snow. Yeah, she had this crazy idea that it could be them, but I doubt it. Why not? Well, first of all, there's no record of it actually ever happening. I think it's just one of those stories that we tell at Christmas time to make us feel good. I mean, but we do know that Abigail did make candles and give them to everyone in town as Christmas presents, and our candles started as an homage to her. - Do you mind? - Yeah, sure. Oh. What's this? Okay, this was found with some water damaged letters in the manor. My mom was convinced the locket belonged to Abigail and she was intent on finding it. Did she? She thought she found it online in an auction, but she was outbid. Hang on. My dad had a picture somewhere, I think. Ah, look. Here. Perfect match. Right? I always wanted to find it for her. That special, huh? It meant a lot to her. I'm not sure why, but I felt it too. What if it's true? What if Benjamin and Abigail are the Christmas couple? Well, you would solve a great mystery. This would be great for my article. Do you mind if I make copies of this? No. Knock yourself out. Oh, and if you stumble on any secret ingredients to the Christmas candle, that would be helpful. Wait. You don't know the recipe? What would Abigail say? Hopefully, apologize for never writing it down. Ouch. That's cold. Hey. Hi. I was, uh... I was just finishing up here. Oh, take your time. Wow, you really got a lot done. Yeah, I hope I got these orders right. Wow. You Bailey's really do have a magic touch. I mean, Jamar is nice and all, but it doesn't have quite the same finesse. How do you mean? I mean, the wicks are perfectly straight, and there's no seam from the cast. It's immaculate. That just doesn't happen. Yeah, it takes a lot of patience. You really do notice the details. Yeah, blame it on the day job. Oh... I got all your orders organized. - Really? - Yeah. Wow, you can actually read that. Here's the admin, and you can see your orders in real-time. Wait. Can my dad work this? If he can play solitaire, he can use this. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. So, I found out some more info on Abigail and Benjamin. Turns out Benjamin had no status at all. Oh, scandalous. Yes! I mean, he must have done something to win the family over. I mean, they got married, right? Here's the real question - did you find anything on the Christmas candle? Because I have been dissecting all day and I still can't figure out one ingredient. It's different than the other candles, both in its texture and the scent. Well, there can't be that many options. I mean, maybe it's whale blubber. You got any of that laying around? No, it's definitely not that. The more I research Christmas candles, the more I think it's more than just an homage. I mean... maybe we could dig a little deeper when you have some time. Um, there is no "we" in this. This is your article. But it's your family, and I really think there's a story here. You know, this could be the greatest romance ever told. Well, if you write it, it'll be the greatest romance ever sold. There's a difference. Fables are a fiction told for entertainment purposes only. Yeah, well, I'm gonna prove that some fables are real. Okay, then, um... happy writing. And... thanks again for the website. Yeah. It was nothing. Bye. See you later. Ooh, cider and caroling? Love the wassailing set-up! Thank you. Let's hope the tourism board agrees. Look, I made something for you. The new Christmas candles? Not exactly. I'm still working on those. But I made these this morning, and I thought that they would be a perfect match for wassailing. Yes! They smell like... Christmas tree and a hint of orange. - Bingo. - It's perfect. I'm gonna need more for Saturday. Well, with my new ordering system, I think I can handle it. Check it out. Look. Wow. When did you have time to do all this? Logan did it. Hmm... Logan, what a prince. Bring him to wassailing. No. I am not asking him out. The man is writing an article on Christmas traditions. Wassailing is a classic. You'd be doing him a favor. Oh... And me. Stay on the nice list. I'll see you Saturday, Mindee. Naughty. Dad, you should be resting. I'm not in a body cast. Oh, and he's really good at telling me what to do. You have to get the right balance. Okay, please. Dad, take a seat. Thank you. Here. I'll swap you. You do the mantle and I will do the tree. All right. Oh... These are nice. - No! - No, no, no! The Christmas candles go in there. It's tradition. Yeah, Mom made a special pair specifically for those candlesticks. Um... Where are they? Let me check if there are more boxes. Okay. Where did you get these? Mom says they were a family heirloom. But who knows? This is a genuine maker's mark. This will give you insight to when and where it was made. Really? What do you know... I got a buddy out in Vegas who deals with antiques and special metals. I've helped him research a few pieces. He might be able to help. Another one of your distractions. I like backstories. Besides... these might be more than just candlesticks. I mean, and why do you put Christmas candles in them? Where does the tradition come from? Maybe you should be in the press corps. Oh, no more boxes. Really? Ah. My buddy said he'll send me a list of appraisers later. I might be able to find out their history on them. Can I borrow them? Sure. If you can find out where they were made, take them. I'd love to know. No, no, no, no, no, no. These candlesticks are not leaving my sight. Your mom knew they were special. Maybe now, we can find out why. Fine. Call the appraisers first. If they can help, then we'll visit. Great. How about tomorrow? I can't. I have a meeting at Seaport Souvenirs tomorrow - potential new buyers. Can I tag along? Why? Research. And I love souvenir shops. I love finding keychains with my name on it; gives me a thrill. Fine, but no chiming in, please. Oh, look, a story. Bet these sell. Good. We'll be different. Ellie! Nice to meet you! Thank you so much for making time, Jack. I know Christmas is your busy season. My pleasure. Did you want to purchase? Oh... No, I'm good. Thanks. Uh... Um... This is my... I mean, this is Logan Osbourne. Logan Osborne - the travel writer? - You know him, too? - We're thrilled that you're covering our little New Hampshire Christmas. My wife and I are big fans of yours. We follow you on social media. So, should we talk candles? Yeah. Right this way. - Okay. - Logan, are you coming? Yeah. Oh, and keychains are on the house. Take as many as you'd like. ♪ In the air, it's start to feel ♪ Great stuff, Ellie, but our customers prefer something well, extraordinary for Christmas. You understand. Of course. Thanks anyway, John. I'll be in touch. Maybe you'll change your mind. And Logan, good luck with that article. I can't wait to read it. Great meeting you. You two have a merry Christmas! - Thanks. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. ♪ Everywhere, it's starting to look like Christmas. Don't. Extraordinary. You're back early. Where's Logan? Ah. Seaport was a bust. Oh... Don't worry. We'll make it work. We've survived worse. Yeah, but this was Mom's legacy. I feel like I'm letting her down, like it's all my fault. - You could never let her down. - You're being nice. I know she was disappointed when I chose New York, and I never helped her make Christmas candles. She wanted to pass on the torch and I wasn't there. She may have had hopes, but she wanted you to fulfill your dreams. Oh... I miss her. Me too... every day... and especially now. You know, I met her my first Christmas in this country. I'll never forget seeing her for the first time in the window of the cottage, making that candle I had ordered for Amma in Kochi. I couldn't tell where the flame began or ended. She was just this... beautiful kaleidoscope. I could sure you some of her light right now. You were our light. Thanks, Dad. Hey, Andrew. Hey. I have news from Nastia. She picked Eric. No, not... not, uh... Not exactly. Eric hasn't sent his in yet. So, is this good news? I would say it's horrific news. Nastia tried your scent and she had a complete emotional breakdown. I'm talking hyperventilating, the whole nine yards. I don't understand. Apparently, she got locked inside an Ikea when she was a child, and they found her hiding under the blankets of a pine bed set of all things. This isn't happening. Yes, yes, it is happening. A couple of Ativans and a few martinis later, she calmed down, but I guess she's been in group therapy for this for years. Okay. Anyway, I covered for you, all right? I told her that you accidentally took your scent with you and that you'd be sending it in. No, but that was my scent. I worked on it for months. Well, you can't admit to that because she'll... She'll report you for a chemical attack. Okay, so, I have to make an entirely new scent. How much time do I have? Before Christmas. This is gonna take a Christmas miracle. Yeah, well, if anyone can do it, you can, all right? I'll have the labs open for you 24/7. No, no, I have to stay here. I can manage. Okay, okay. Well, you see, the thing is it's gotta smell like Christmas, right? It's gotta smell like Christmas. Okay? Just make sure of that. But not an actual Christmas tree. No, no, no! Not a Christmas tree. Okay? It cannot... Cannot smell like a Christmas tree. Let's stay away from that. Okay, thanks, Andrew. I'll get to work. Look, I know this whole thing is very strange, it's very weird, but let's just keep our eyes on the prize here. Okay? Eyes on the prize Paris. Think about Paris. Alright? I believe in you. What smells like Christmas? I saw the light on from the house. Yeah. Mmm... Your dad's hot cocoa? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. You're welcome. Wait. Do you think this smells like Christmas? I think it smells like hot chocolate. Yeah, yeah, of course. - Working on a new candle? - No perfume. My boss called. Apparently, Nastia got lost in IKEA as a kid and now has PTSD from a pine bedroom suite. What? Don't ask. The point is I have until Christmas Eve to make a brand new perfume. - Six days? - Yeah. Ah, that's okay. Van Gogh painted Sunflowers in four days and Stallone wrote Rocky in three days. Masterpieces don't have to take that long. You're in good company. I certainly am. - What's this? - Mm. Some old wax I found in my mom's storage. Oh. Do you think you can make any candles? Maybe two. Do you want to make a candle? I would love to. I mean, I'd be great research for my article - "Christmas by Candlelight." Oh. And I can prove to you that distractions are good for creative process. Okay, fine, fine. I could use a break from perfume making. All right. Okay. Take your coat off, have a seat at the station. I'll get you an apron. Oh... All right, here. This should fit. Uh, like this. I need a little help. Yeah, sure. Um... Um... All right, so, now, you are going to pick up the wax, and with this shaver... shave it into the pot. Whoa, whoa, Whoa. Slow down. This is art. What's this scent, anyway? It wasn't labelled, but maybe bayberry. Um... do you mind? No. Please. Okay, let me show you something. It's better if you hold it like this, and then, if you just put a little bit of pressure... Yeah, that's it. Let it slide down the wax. There we go. All right, so, now, we're gonna take the wooden spoon, gonna give it a stir. - May I? - Yeah, of course. You'll feel it's quite thick at the bottom. You want to really make sure all that heat... I'm gonna get you to hold this. But be careful. Hold it by the handle 'cause it's gonna be very hot. Okay. Now, ladle... this wax into... There we go. I am gonna hold these wicks straight and you're gonna, very carefully, pour the hot wax into this mold. That's it. Oh, very good. Oh, I really trust you. This is actually really fun. Yeah. That's good. Oh, perfect. Perfect. We just hold these straight. Once they've cooled... Wow. Very good for a first try. Follow me. And here, I'll let you do the honors. Just make sure they're perfectly balanced here. And... let them dry overnight. Hm. This is a long process. The best things in life usually are. They take time to follow through. That's hard in the world of instant gratification. Well, patience is also an art. How do you think candles stood the test of time? Well, my mom used to say candles are a reflection of ourselves. Here. The wax is the body, the wick is the mind, and together they give home to the flame - the spark of life. And the heart... The heart is the candle's love. And that's how it defies darkness. And why it stands the test of time. Each candle is different, but they all serve the same purpose. Is that what makes them special at Christmas? Yeah, that... That is what makes them special at Christmas. Um... Candles are here to stay. I'll put that in my article. Yes, they have... exceptional longevity. Yeah, especially that bayberry wax. How old do you think that is? Oh, of course. Of course, of course. It's been in front of me the whole time. Bayberry grows on the property. This is it. This is the missing ingredient. Did we just make Christmas candles? I think so. Sorry. I'm so excited. I'm just happy I could help. You know what? I could use more of your help. I have to make candles for wassailing at the tavern. Are you in? Hmm... On two conditions. One, I get to keep one, and two, we get to go wassailing afterwards. Hmm... Yes and yes. Sit down. I'm gonna give you some more wax. I see how this is. Yeah. Okay. ♪ There's a season ♪ I've always loved that song. Wow. Are all those one order? Making wassailing extra special. You got those done all so quick. Well, I had some help, actually. - Are the candles ready? - Yeah. I would have helped you bring these in. That's okay. Look. So, what do you think, Jamar? Can I add candlemaker to my resume? Very good. Better than me. But wait. I have a real Christmas surprise. Ready? Are these Christmas candles? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I found some extra wax and Logan helped me find the missing ingredient - bayberry. Bayberry, of course. Oh... Now, Christmas is complete. And you can make more. Oh yeah, I've made some for Mindee, and I've already picked more bayberry and have started the process of turning it into wax. Wait. Let's light 'em. Oh, no, no. I don't want to be late for Mindee. Dad, are you riding with us? I think I'll sit this one out, what with my injured wassailing hand and all. Dad, you've always been such a terrible liar. What are you up to? I'm just needing to do some more decorating? Go. Okay. Enjoy your date. - What? - Oh, no, no. It's not a date. Yeah, it's certainly not a date. - No. - No. No, no. Two beautiful young people out for a night of fun and merriment, nothing like a date. I don't know why I thought that. Bye, Dad. Joker. Enjoy the wassailing. ♪ Magic is falling ♪ ♪ Straight from the sky ♪ ♪ Covering everything ♪ ♪ Glistening white ♪ ♪ Jack Frost is fine... ♪ This is a great turnout. Yeah. That must be the tourism board. Very festive. Really? In ugly Christmas sweaters? I thought they'd be wearing suits or something. Ugly? I think it's quite stylish. - Uh... - Okay. So, I guess it's a good thing I didn't wear my light-up reindeer ears. A very good thing. Okay. I feel like we need to liven things up. Why don't you do the Yuletide blessing? Come on, you are a Bailey. No way, Mindee. Bah humbug to you. You are just lucky that I love these new Christmas candles so much. You're welcome. Yuletide blessing? When Portsmouth was first being settled, the Lord and Lady of every manor would give a blessing to the people, you know, going door to door, singing carols, drinking cider. Wow, a true Christmas tradition. And my mom would do it every year. She was a total natural. That's not me. Hey, don't sell yourself short. Only you could have found bayberry. I think the bayberry found me. Alright, so, now that you've made Christmas candles, what's gonna be your Christmas wish? Ah! Romance. You know, some of us just want a successful career. You know, you can have it all. Hm. Not in my experience. Oh, so bleak. No. Look, I thought I had it, fairy tale and all. But let's just say my ex preferred to be a free agent. Skeptic candlemaker doesn't trust them to come back from the storm. True statement? Um, snow is pretty, but it clouds the judgment. I find tropical climates more practical. So, why not do both? That's what I do. A nomad. But don't you ever get lonely on the road? No. I guess I've always been a grass is greener kind of guy. And I know better, you know, grass is just grass. But you know, when you're always on the move, relationships are hard. And you never want a place to call home? Someday, when I find it. But imagine what you could accomplish if you stayed in one place. You know, the grass becomes a garden. I bet you'd find that novel idea a lot easier if you did. Ellie, I think great stories are like love - you don't go looking for them; they'll find you. Oh, they're leaving! What do I do? Comp them more drinks? Dance a ceremonial jig? Calm down. Uh... I'm just saying, if your mom were here, she would say the blessing, tell a great story, and bring down the house. Um... Uh... what are you doing? I'm not sure. Oh! I am so sorry! I'll give this right back. Uh... Um... The Lady of Bayberry Hill wishes to bestow a blessing. May love and joy come to you on this eve of wassailing. Drink from my cup! Whoo! And may Yuletide blessings shower you and yours as the falling snow. May your voices rise up and song to the heavens. Um... ♪ Here we come a-wassailing ♪ ♪ Among the leaves so green ♪ ♪ Here we come a-wand'ring ♪ ♪ So fair to be seen ♪ ♪ Love and joy come to you ♪ ♪ And to you your wassail too ♪ ♪ And God bless you and send you ♪ ♪ A happy New Year ♪ ♪ And God send you ♪ A happy New Year ♪ Whoo! Oh my gosh. Wow. This was one of my mom's Christmas traditions. I can't believe my dad did all this. I love your family traditions. It's nice. Yeah. Imagine when they used to use real candles to decorate these trees. But I bet it was a lot less safe. Yeah. Hey, do you want to go for a drive tomorrow? I have to check my schedule. Oh. Such a busy lady. Well, I've got so many orders to fulfil now, thanks to you. Well, I hope you like antiques. Hi, welcome. - How can I help you? - Hi. I'm Logan Osborne. I believe I spoke to you over the phone. - Right, about the candlesticks. - Yeah. - All-righty. - Oh. - What do you think? - Oh my... Well, this is very interesting. This is... clearly very special. Would you be willing to sell or trade? I don't know. Maybe an engagement ring? - Oh, no, no. - Oh, no, no, no. Actually, they're a family heirloom. Her family's from around here. Really? The silversmith didn't make many pieces, but they were all a variety. But do you know his name? Yeah. Um, Bailey, Benjamin Bailey. You know him? - I'm related. - Oh, well, that's wonderful. Yeah. Listen, let me go on the back. Sometimes you can find pieces and found lists, registries. Let me take a look. Okay. Thank you. I can't believe these candlesticks go back to Abigail and Benjamin. No, seriously, I thought 1940s tops. My mom would be over the moon right now. Aren't you glad you came? Yes. Well, like I said, not many pieces. This is a list of everything that's registered. But this is just a series of numbers. Is there any way of finding out what the objects are? I'm afraid not. Well, we're looking specifically for a locket with a Christmas tree engraved on it. Do you think any of these might be it? Uh, maybe. There's just no way of knowing. Well, this is still incredible to have. Thank you so much. My family makes candles as an homage to the Candle Couple. I love that story. Oh, it just... It gives me faith that... anything is possible at Christmas. Here, please. Oh, that's so kind of you. Thank you so much. Of course. Yeah, there's something about that scent, it just reminds me of Christmas. Mmm... The warm bayberry mixed with the cool metal. Thank you, Logan. Wait a minute. Oh, sounds like you have a lead. Uh, yeah. I don't know if this will help, but Benjamin's shop was in Richmond Hill, and the Old Inn - that's right - um, they might have records of Benjamin or his work. The gentleman who owns the place a history fanatic, and he has an awful lot of documents and record books. - We've gotta go. - Okay. Okay. - Thank you. - Okay! - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Good luck. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas and thank you. Welcome. Can I get you a drink? I recommend Washington's eggnog. - As in George Washington? - Is there another? His very own Christmas recipe. Oh. Two, please. I am going to join you and make it three. - All right. - For you. And for you. And for me makes three. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Now I know how they stayed warm on the battlefield. Why, yes, sir. And the rest, as they say, is history. You two need menus? Um, actually, we're here digging up some local history. Well, you came to the right place; my family has owned this tavern since it was built in the 1700s. Well, a silversmith made this around 1880. His maker's mark is on the back. - May I? - Please. He had a shop in Richmond Hill. His name was Benjamin Bailey. If I recall, the Baileys used to own Bayberry Hill in Portsmouth. She's a Bailey. We're trying to find out more about her ancestry. A Bailey, huh? Ah, come with me. I'll show you the good stuff. You can come, too. Follow me. Right down here. Watch your step. Well, you should be able to find more information about Bailey... down here. Oh... I'm also writing an article about a young couple that got married on Christmas Day. The story goes that the groom got lost in a snowstorm and the bride literally a Christmas candle to guide him home. Do you know anything about that? Well, we have a few stories of men lost in snowstorms. You're welcome to search, if you have the perseverance to find it. Please, join us when you're done. Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. - Have fun. If you need anything, name's Elijah. You know, the Christmas party sounds a lot more fun. Oh, no, no, no. You brought us here. We should try. Maybe we'll find something interesting. Yeah, okay. Come on. - Ooh! - Come here. Let me help you. Thank you. What is that? It's a song sheet about... candlesticks. "Oh through the snow "and darkest of night, "The Candlestick Man fell to the cold winter's blight. "Struck down to his knees, his flame near extinguished, "The locket he made, he let go and relinquished." Do you think this is about Benjamin and Abigail? Let's find Elijah. I remember this song. This could be about a real person. Most of the ones written in this era were. What era is that? Oh, 1860s... maybe '70s. It was a popular pub song, especially at Christmas. It has to be about Benjamin and Abigail. I mean, it even talks about the locket. Too bad we didn't have the locket and could just check at the maker's mark. I mean, otherwise, this is all wishful thinking. Well, if you're looking for a story about a locket, you should go to Mrs. Waterford's. It was a boarding house between here and Portsmouth. They have a beautiful holiday light walk. Weekends only. One of their displays is a locket of love. Maybe it'll help your search. When is your article due? December 24th. We can make it. Thank you so much. - My pleasure. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Cheers. - Good luck. Bottoms up. Mmm. Yeah. Ooh, that'll put hair on your chest. - Yeah! - Thank you! - Don't drive. - Thank you. Good morning! Morning. Are we ready to land a new client? Yes I am. All right. So, who are we meeting with? Jane Mitchell from Rocaway Resorts. Oh. Um... What about the Christmas candles? Oh, no, Rocaway is very high-end; they're not interested in stories. So, I am just going to stick to the basics. Okay then. Oh, by the way, I talked to my buddy about your locket. I emailed him a copy of the auction photo. I'm hoping he can track down some details. Oh, I hope so. I'm rooting for them. Yeah, I'm hoping he can give us a lead. Yeah. - How does everything look? - Oh, great. I don't know why, I'm so nervous. Don't be. Mr. Busbee? Jane normally does the buying for my resorts, but after your... intriguing performance at wassailing, I thought I'd come down and... check out a little local history for myself. You're Rocaway Resorts. I prefer Raymond. Raymond. Absolutely. It's so nice to see you again. Um, please, right this way. So, as you can see, we have a variety of candles in various scents and colors, for every season. They are all are all non-toxic, and vegan, and cruelty-free. Everything we make here is done on the premises, as it has been, uh, for... I am so sorry to interrupt. But I just found these last two candles - the historical bayberry candles. I'm writing an article about them for Travelique Magazine. - Is that right? - Mm-hmm. I've heard about you. Oh, but Ellie, you want to tell him the story? I know the story. But have you heard the truth? Ellie? Well, my family comes from a long line of candlemakers. Abigail Bailey was the first, and she would make bayberry candles and give them to everyone in town, and the legend is that bayberry holds magic that makes Christmas wishes come true. Ah, the Lady of Bayberry Hill. I didn't know you were magic, as well as clumsy. Oh, well, the magic comes from the candles; the clumsiness is all me, unfortunately. Go on. Well, a couple were separated by a terrible snowstorm right before they were to be married. On Christmas Day. - Of course. - Right. Everyone feared the worst, but the bride had unwavering faith that her groom would return. So, she lights a candle. Yes, but not just any candle. She lit a bayberry candle and she made a wish. It inspired the whole town. They all light their bayberry candles to help him find his way. And on Christmas Eve, he returned and married the love of his life. And your saying this Abigail, your ancestor, was the bride in the story and the reason why your family makes candles. I am. Hmm. Well, true or not, it does make you believe in Christmas magic. If there's one thing I've learned in the hotel business is that fantasy sells - resorts or candles. I'm in. Package these with the story. Who wouldn't love a Christmas wish with their candle? I can pair it with a coupon for cider at Portsmouth Tavern. Absolutely. That is a great idea. It's good cider. I've worn it myself. I am so sorry about that. Take a bow. You were right. The story sold the candles. Hmm? I won't boast too much. But maybe just one... "I told you so." I deserve it. Don't think I didn't notice. The love. In your eyes. When you're making candles? It's different than when you're making perfume. So, what are you trying to say? I'm saying you should follow your heart. Oh, like you? Bouncing around wherever your heart desires? Sounds like more of a fear of commitment. Ouch. Why stay where you're unhappy? How do you know I'm unhappy? At the risk of sounding like a pretentious writer... Hmm? Nothing could hold a flame to the light in your eyes when you are making a candle. Um... We still need to light those. Yeah, definitely. See if Christmas wishes come true. Okay. So, what did you wish for? Candle company is back on track. That's true. Um... I guess finding the perfect Christmas perfume, but I think I already have, So, I guess I'm wishing for... um... I wish that... I'm wishing, um, that my new perfume gets me my promotion. What did you wish for? I wished to finish my novel. Well, I hope we both get our Christmas wishes. Oh, you didn't. - Oh, yeah, I did. - Oh! It looks so good, though. So, what do you think? Will Mrs. Waterford unlock the mystery once and for all? I hope so. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, me too. Okay, I'm gonna find the best tree and you're gonna help me decorate it. I can't. Really? Why not? Does it have anything to do with a certain writer? I knew you two would hit it off! - We're friends. - Really? 'Cause your dad says he's coming to Christmas dinner. No, no. He's helping me make candles and I'm helping him with his article on the Candle Couple, that's it. Well, I still like the sound of it. Seriously, it's like the universe is gifting you your very own Christmas romance. Just like the famous candle couple. Follow your heart, Ellie. Come on, it's Christmas! So I know you're technically still working, but I just really want to celebrate your new Christmas scent. No, it's perfect timing. It's just cooling. - Great, then let's celebrate. - Okay, yes! Nice. - To success. - To success. - Mmm. - Let's go by the fire. Okay. So prepared. So do you want to try it? Um, I'm more of a cologne guy. I think my robust masculinity might drown out the smell. It's sweet. With a hint of cool. That's the part you inspired. When we were at the silversmith, you said that bayberry and silver reminded you of Christmas, and so it inspired me to mix bayberry with a cool metallic edge. I'm calling it Bayberry Hill. That's great. Too bad nobody will know its origin story. What? Why? You created it. Yeah, but this is Nastia's company, I'm just a small part of her empire. You are way more than that. And you should claim it, it's your family legacy. I mean, sure, it stings, But what can I do? We both know the truth. That's all that matters, right? As long as you're happy, I am. Oh. You are a popular guy. Social media never stops. That scent is great. I think you're going to Paris. You're very confident. Some things you can just feel, right? Yeah, I guess. - Hey. - Hi. - I made egg nog. - I'll be in in a minute. Your mother loved this tree. Do you remember that one Christmas where you woke up and you thought all the presents were gone? Yeah! And she put them under this tree. And we all sat around on Christmas morning and opened presents. Dad, Mom said Abigail and Benjamin got married under an evergreen. Do you think it was this one? Not sure. It would be my pick. Raymond Busbee made a huge order for next year. Your Mom would be so proud of you. I feel like she's been with me this whole time. Guiding me. Oh. - Oh, it's Andrew! - Egg nog will keep. Okay. Hey, Andrew! Are you ready for the best Christmas gift you could possibly imagine? December 23rd, remember this day. Everybody loves Bayberry Hill. Especially Nastia. So does that mean... I would say "Start packing" in French, but I don't speak French, so I'll just say start packing. Oh my God! This is really happening! We'll work out all the details in January, but you nailed it, and I want you to take some time, relax, enjoy yourself, because you earned it. Thank you, Andrew! Merry Christmas. So I heard you got your wish. Jamar told me. Yeah. I guess. It's so beautiful here. Those triangles look familiar. What are the odds? They can't be. That's the maker's mark, the lock has gotta be here. Oh man. And you. Logan. - Oh. - Hello. You two here to get good luck from the Lover's Locket? - Oh, no. - No. Actually, we just wanted to learn more about it. - Oh. - My name is Ellie. This is Logan. I'm actually from Portsmouth and I've never heard about this. I'm Agnes, and I don't really advertise. It's a story from long ago that my family celebrates every Christmas. A traveler was stuck in a snow storm. My great-great grandparents. Found him and took him in. He offered them money but they wouldn't accept it. They just wished him well for his safe return. That night, my great-great grandmother was cleaning the bedding, and she found the most beautiful silver locket, with a note. You wouldn't happen to have the note? Oh, no, sadly lost to time. But do you remember what it said? I do, the traveler said, "I can never repay you "for giving me the most precious gift of all, "my safe return to the love of my life. "Will you please accept this small token of my gratitude? "It came from my heart, please keep it in yours." Do you remember his name? No, sadly, also lost to time. Would you like to see it? - Yes. - Yes, please. What if Benjamin and Abigail are the candle couple? You would be the descendant of the greatest Christmas romance ever. - I'm nervous, Logan. - Why? Because I don't want her to be wrong. Oh, even if she got some of the fact's wrong, Benjamin's maker's mark is here. I'm not talking about Agnes. Charles and Dickens. God rest their souls. - It's not here. - What? The maker's mark is not here, I don't understand. Why do you have it on the fence if it's not on the locket? Uh, come again, dear? The two triangles over there, why... Triangle? That's just a Christmas tree. Is this even silver? That is the Lover's Locket, I need to put it away again. Wait, this doesn't make any sense. Why would she have two triangles all lit up? She... she said it was a Christmas tree. No, no, I don't believe it. The song, her story. The locket. The candlesticks! It just doesn't add up! Well, you know, sometimes we want to believe the fantasy so badly that we don't see things clearly. It's fine, you still have enough for your article. This isn't just about my article. This is about you, too. I want you to know where you came from. Logan, honestly, thank you. I mean it, thank you so much for what you've tried to do for me and my family, but... I think we've reached the end here. On the bright side, you still have Paris. I actually forgot about it. You don't sound excited. Come on, it's the city of lights. But I think I like the light right here. Me too. I'm sorry, I have to take this. - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Hey, Andrew, what's up? Ellie, what is going on? At first I thought this was a coincidence, but then R finds this: "Ellie's exclusive Bayberry Hill candles." Are you packaging this scent by yourself? - What? - Who is Logan Osborne and why has he posted this picture of you where you're with this candle, and some whole story about how the candles grant Christmas wishes or something? - Logan posted about it online? - Yeah, he posted it! And Nastia now thinks that you're using her to promote your own products. Oh, no, no, I would never do that. Please just tell Nastia this is a big misunderstanding. Well, I'll try, but she's furious. I think you can just forget about Paris. Andrew, please, I will fix this, I will get the posts taken down immediately. - I'll see what I can do. - Okay, thank you. Is everything okay? You posted about the Christmas candles online? Why? Yeah, I teased it in my stories, I got a ton of messages about it, I was trying to promote sales. Yeah, but now my company thinks I'm stealing my own idea from them. But it's yours! This is an opportunity. - I was trying to help. - No, no, this... This is a disaster. Okay, Ellie, this is not what I wanted, and... I lost Paris, and possibly my job. Please, please just take the posts down. - I need to do damage control. - Ellie, I'm so sorry. - I was not thinking... - I know, I know. You were just thinking about your own story, it's fine. You'll be off on your next assignment, and I'm just left picking up the pieces - of what's left of my life. - Ellie! Ellie! Listen. Surely, they'll see this is just a big misunderstanding, okay? And they'll see the light on this. There is no light on this, Logan. That's the thing about candles. They burn out. Ellie... Ellie! Ellie. Wrapping presents is usually fun. We have sad Christmas music on? I did not even know that existed. Sorry, I'm distracted. Where's Logan? I have no idea. So obviously I'm totally on your side, but... He did help your sales. Jamar said he got orders from the Christmas candle from all over the country. Tell me that's not your Mom's Christmas wish come true. Yeah, it just cost me Paris and possibly my career. Ellie, have you ever thought that maybe there's something else out there for you? Something better? Okay, I'm just gonna say this, 'cause you're my friend, but you have been different since you've been back this trip. - Oh, come on. - It's true! Ever since you met Logan. He got me to believe. I don't hate him, Mindee. I hate that I miss him. Well, what's wrong with that? A heart is not like a job, once it breaks, it's broken, and there is no putting the pieces back together. Maybe not. Tell him how you feel. What's the point? We're both headed in different directions. Life isn't a fairy tale. You can't just wish on a candle and expect everything to be okay. Your Mom used to tell us that it was faith that made Christmas wishes come true. And the candle was just the spark. Mrs. Waterford? Andrew. Hi. I got all the posts taken down and I've refunded all the candles. - We need to talk. - Nastia? Nastia, I am so sorry, I can explain. I do love this scent, yet you have a candle you're selling. Yes, yes. The Bayberry candle is a Christmas tradition in our family. We've been making it for generations. Well, it's very clear to me you should not be making perfume. Are you firing me? I read Logan Osborne's article. I loved it. It was the most romantic Christmas story I have ever heard. I'm a firm believer in sir-endipity. Yeah, me too... Ser-endipity. Zip it! Anyway, I've been wanting to move into home decor, and I think these candles would be perfect. - You want to sell my candle? - As a partnership. Unless you want the lights of Paris. Um, no, no! The lights of Portsmouth are just as beautiful. Yes, I would love a partnership. Wonderful. Here's Andrew, okay? I've gotta get to a shoot. Thank you, Nastia. Merry Christmas. I don't know if you ended up making a wish on those Christmas candles, but this definitely is a miracle. Actually, I did. Congratulations, it came true. I'll set a meeting in January to go over all the details. Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Merry Christmas. Hey, you enjoy your Christmas Eve. Um... Nastia wants to partner with us. - What?! - What? So you're officially taking over the candle business? I knew something better was out there for you! This was your mother's dream for you. I guess Christmas wishes do come true. Thanks to Logan. Have you been able to reach him? It goes straight to voicemail. He left in such a hurry, I thought he was upset. I was worried about him. What exactly did you say to him? Something terrible. I was wrong. I need to explain it to him. Did he say where he was going? No, just thanked me and walked out. Left the keys and everything. He needs to find his way back home. I need to show him. Uh, I'll go. Abigail lit a candle to guide Benjamin back to her. Bring Logan back to me. I hope history repeats itself. Yeah. Yeah, The first post of the Bayberry Hill Candle Company. I tagged Logan, and everyone else in town, just in case. Good. Okay, maybe your Dad needs some help in the kitchen. - I'll be in in a minute. - Okay. Not too long though, that storm is coming in quick. Okay. Ellie, don't go. Dad, I have to. Not without a coat! Logan! Ellie! You came back. Wait, you didn't walk, did you? No, just up the road. My truck hit a snow bank and I couldn't see anything. I thought I lost you. Where were you? I went to get you a Christmas gift. What? Wait. Is this...? Read the inscription. "Dear Abigail, our flame weathers any storm. "Love, Benjamin." The story is true, Ellie. But how did you find this? I went back to talk to Agnes about the locket, something just didn't add up. She admitted she sold the locket online years ago. The one she showed us, she had engraved just so she could sell tickets. So I charmed her into giving me the real buyer's info, and I asked them about the maker's mark. It was two triangles. Merry Christmas, Ellie. I am so sorry about everything. No, I'm sorry, I was wrong. I don't want Paris. I want Portsmouth. But what about your perfume? Nastia read your post and she loved the Abigail and Benjamin story. I just never thought in a million years I would want to be a candle maker. You're so much more than a candle maker, Ellie. You're the light.
