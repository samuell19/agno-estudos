Sitting, sir. Uh-huh. There's a sign out front says no trespassing. You read that? Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir. School doesn't start till next week. Get out... the same way you got in. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Is Dickie around? Dickie doesn't work here anymore. He got fired. Shit, that's too bad. Yeah. Let me get a fifth of Jack Daniel's, half pint of mescal and rum, couple of daiquiris in a can, some Bloody Mary mixers, and... I'll get a 12-pack of Bud while you ring it up. Is there a problem? Not if you have some I.D. Oh, yeah. There you go. Thomas Drake. The wrestler? All-state. I know. I saw you at the invitationals last year. You were great. Thanks, my man. Didn't you used to go out with Mary Moseley? Oh, yeah! I nailed her in the backseat of my car. Oh, boy, was she a hose beast. Mary Moseley's my little sister. Did you say Kleinman or Moseley? Moseley. Oh! Mary Moseley's a terrific girl. I'm amazed I even got her confused with Mary Kleinman, because Mary Moseley's fantastic. She's... she's a fabulous girl. She... she is. Tom, I find it hard to believe that you're 28 and still in high school. It's for my dad. See, he's kind of an alcoholic. Sorry. It's casual. Hey, hey, kid, we've been waiting here for 20 minutes! I'm sorry, sir. One at a time. What is goin' on? Bill, this is a league man. How many times do I have to tell you league people don't wait? Where's the other kid? I'm sure Tommy's on his way. On his way? I don't pay him to be on his way. Now, I am fed up with his act. If he isn't here in ten minutes, he's out. I'd rather cut him loose and give you the raise. I could use a raise. Ten minutes. Hi, Tommy. Did you see that bulge he had in the wrestling team photo last year? I can't believe they print those pictures. Tommy! Ahh! Two, three, four and five. Thanks. Yo, man. Tommy. Been doin' your job for two hours. Get to work. It's casual. You guys okay? Excuse me, miss, but could I check the security on your back entrance? We've had some prowler reports in the neighborhood. Sure, Officer. Go right ahead. Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but we'd rather pay a precautionary visit like this than endanger your safety. Well, that camera above the door photographs everyone as they come in. You may photograph everyone, miss, but, uh... does everyone know... how to make you... squeal with pleasure? Huh? David, please. Mr. Carlton only left a minute ago. I know. I saw him go. I missed you tonight. There was a huge explosion by the high school. Hell of a lot of damage. I grabbed the punks who did it. You okay? It's a job. David, I thought maybe we could go out tonight. Mm-hmm. It's dangerous. Don't worry about it, all right? I'm a cop. Hey, Jim! Jim! Hey, Tony, what's up? How's it goin'? All right. Where have you been? Just hangin' out. All right! Not bad. At least you don't look like a flamin' geek anymore. Thanks. Hey, did you see Apocalypse Now on cable? Eleven times. Just keep that back entrance double-deadbolted, miss, and I wouldn't worry about the prowlers. Okay. Thank you, Officer. You're too young to smoke, son. Hi, Jim. Hi, Anita. What do you got that's fresh? Oh, everything's fresh. Lady, please don't disturb league lanes. Thank you. Sorry, Bill. He is so nice! You know, Bill, you're a lucky guy. You're moving into the woman palace of all time. I'm proud of you. 'Cause when they talk about the Bill Conrad years, they'll say, Bill Conrad? We never knew just what a wild man he really was... until he moved in to the house of love. Thanks a lot. So I guess the first party's tomorrow tonight... right? Not a chance. Mistake. ¶ I'm tired of wasting all my precious time ¶ ¶ You got to be all mine ¶ All mine ¶ Foxy lady ¶ Here I come Hey! Turn that shit off. Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I said turn that shit off. Okay, come on. Let's go. Get outta here. You really scare me. He's pretty tough, Glen. Think you can handle him, buddy? Come on. Hit me. Who is this kid? You're too young, and too little for me to execute. Then don't give me shit. Fuckin' muscle-heads grow up to be cops. You almost got us killed. Hey, as soon as you're scared, you're dead. Just like Charlie said about 'Nam... we went in sloppy and we came out sloppy. You told me I was gonna meet Charlie two weeks ago. Can't just barge in on him. Man, Charlie's a vet. Hey, Jim, come here. Mom's been lookin' for you. You're supposed to be home. I'll be home later. Your brother's sort of a strange kid. You seen Anita lately? Sure. Why? She's a hot babe. I think dumping her was a major mistake on your part. Anita was nice. I really liked her. But there is something so exciting about complete independence. Like what? Well, you'll see how it feels when you graduate. You move on. I don't know. You look for something more than you get from high school girls. Like blow jobs? No. Like a mature relationship. See, I'm almost 19. I can't still be hangin' around Alexander High waitin' to pick up my girlfriend. It's embarrassing. Absolutely. Good night. Bill. Did you know that Anita had another boyfriend? Really? I think it's an older guy. Wow. Good for her. I'm really happy for her. Good night. All right. Okay, who's your new boyfriend? Who told you I had a new boyfriend? It doesn't matter. Just tell me. Is it true? Listen, Bill, I'm trying to work here, okay? Reggie? Yeah. The receipts are in the drawer. Okay, babe. We're just goin' out. Great. That's great. I have to find out from other people. I found out from Tom Drake. You're the one who needed your freedom. How you doing there? Okay. Well, I didn't know that was an excuse for you to start goin' out with the entire male race. Look, Bill, you're not my boyfriend anymore, okay? Fine. We don't go out for three months, and this is what happens. Three months is a long time when you don't have anybody to go out with. Well, since when do you have to go out all the time? We used to have fun just stayin' in. Look, Bill, I gotta go, okay? Call me sometime. Bye, Reggie. You got it. Have a maple bar, brother. They're fresh. It's great stuff. Enjoy. Thanks a lot. Good night. Good night. Great sale, kiddo. Listen, this isn't a criticism, okay? I'm not comin' down on you. It's just, as well as selling pieces-- Like, what'd you sell, pants and a shirt? Two shirts. Two shirts is great, but we're goin' for a whole look thing here, okay? So think beads and belts and bracelets-- whatever else you can sell for the whole ensemble thing, ya know? I tried. She didn't have the money. Well, you know, go with your instincts. It's workin' for you. It's great. Hey, Anita, I'm almost outta here, okay? I saw David tonight. You did? Let me just close up the register. We'll get outta here. You said you wanted an adventure. I just can't believe it's with a cop. He doesn't act like a cop, though. Do you realize he could arrest you for being underage? Bill was nice. We only did it about... four, five times. But David... The way he just grabbed me and kissed me. I didn't even have a choice. He just had to have me. Tommy used to be like that... sort of. Well, every book I read said it wouldn't happen till I was 25. And then... it happened. Boom! My first orgasm. Jim! Jim! Could you please turn off that music?! Mom says you came home with beer on your breath tonight. So what? Look, Jim, I'm not in the mood for your shit. What do you care? You're moving out. You're too young to be out running around all night. You have school next week. I haven't decided if I'm going yet, all right? Why don't you get real, Jim? You're 15. You have no choice in the matter. Mom doesn't need the grief, okay? You care about Mom? That's a laugh. You're the one with the Playboy apartment, not me. Hey, I earned it. I'm five years older than you. But I'm here for you anytime you need me. Don't give me that older-brother shit. Man, why don't you just go bowling? Everybody's a comedian. Okay. If you want to hang around here all day long playing army, it's fine with me. Tommy! I can't believe you! I can't believe you. Who do you think you are? You can't just come walking in here. You can't keep doing that to me. Eileen, I've been thinking about you all day. Let me give you a back rub. No way! What? Shh! You'll wake up my mom and dad. They love me. Give me a kiss. Look... if you wanna see me, you have to call first. And don't just come by work, either. You'll only get me into trouble there. Eileen, I only wanna stay for a few hours. I'm serious, Tommy. If you don't get outta here right now, I'm gonna scream. You won't scream. I'll wake up my dad, I'll wake up my mom, I'll wake up everybody. You won't scream. I'll scream. You won't scream. Look, Anita's boyfriend brings her champagne, and you... you just come crawling in through the window. You take me for granted. That's not true, Eileen. What about your birthday? I was there. What about your tonsillectomy? I was there, Eileen. I was the only one there. When you thought Esther Davidson had a better body than you, I was there... to comfort you. You're right, Tommy. Whenever I feel terrible, you're always there. See? You don't really wanna scream. Gimme a kiss. I'll be back! Billy? Billy, where are you? Oh, there you are. Mom, what are you doing? Isn't this wonderful? I borrowed it from the Thompsons. It's so easy to use. Oh, that's nice. You don't have to make such a big deal about this. I mean, I'm still gonna see you. My eldest son is leaving home, and I want a record of this. Oh, that looks wonderful. Mom... Billy, are you sure you wanna do this? Mom, you said-- Fold them very neatly. Fold them neatly. Mom, you said when I was 18, I could do what I wanted. This is what I want. I mean, I saved up all summer long for this, and I already have the place. Take the hanger. Stop. Take pictures of Jim. Oh, Jim! That's a wonderful idea. He should be in this shot. Jim, come here. I want you... Jim, would you come here? I want you to stand next to your brother. That's good. Stand right next... No, just look at each other. That's nice. Gimme a break. Oh, the blanket! Oh, Billy, you look so young. You don't even have any hair on your chest. Mom, Dad left home when he was 17. Your father left us when he was 40, remember? Go back in the closet. Bill, you don't have to do this. You could stay here, you wouldn't have to pay rent. Mom, I love you. But... Bill, say that in the camera, dear. Mom, I love you. No, the way you did before. You know, with more feeling. Look, it's only 14 blocks away. Ooh, big man. 14 blocks. Hey, get lost, Jim. You're really takin' off. Screw off. Jim! Jim, this is a permanent record. You shouldn't do that. Billy, get back in here. Billy. Geez, Mom. I'm not gonna bullshit you, Bill. I know it's tough for a guy like you to afford a place like this, but you seem like the kind of guy that can handle it, huh? Thank you, Mr. Davis. Oh, lots of girls! This way, Bill. This way, boy. I thought I was getting Unit 32. We had to rent that one out. But listen, since you're a first-time renter, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you in the northern corner-- Unit 93. You're gonna love it. The northern corner? The northern corner. Whoa! It sounds all right, but I'd like to see it first. Okay. Now, if you like it, it'll mean a slightly larger security deposit. About 950-- that's not including the pool key. That's about $100 more than I brought. Hey, no problem. Are you kidding? We'll just put it on the next rent check. I've really been looking forward to living here, Mr. Davis. We've been looking forward to having you. It's quiet, it's spacious here in the northern corner. On top of that, a lot of doctors live here. Prepare yourself. I don't wanna say too much, Bill. Just stand here a moment. You feel it, Bill? It's the wild life. Huh? I love it. Sorry I'm late. I had to go to the hospital and donate some blood for my dad. It's amazing he's still alive. I moved in this morning. It's great. I can stay up as late as I want, I can sleep in. I can do anything. I know I wasn't the most outgoing guy in high school, but I really think this experience is gonna change me. I'm in the real world now. I can do whatever I want at home right now. No, it's not the same. You'll know when you get there. It's different. You missed a piece. I know. I don't need this shit, man. I'm a specialist. I could be teaching little kids how to wrestle. Be right back. Do we know you? No. Where's the war? Hi. Hi. You know this guy? Not really. Get outta here. Do you see this? Next time, it's your face, clown. See ya later. You're up. Five orders of fries, Tommy. Thanks. Guys, live it up. It's on me. I have something very important to tell you. Are we talking about a party? I've been up all night. Eileen and I are gonna be married. Bullshit. It's true. I've nailed my share of babes. They call me, they hang around. They sit on my car. It's gotten old. Yeah, but you don't have to get married. Yeah, why buy the milk when the cow is free? Yeah, well, I didn't say I was getting married yet. I just said I was getting engaged. Get our pictures in the paper. Scholarship guys see it. It's good for the relationship. It's good all around. Swine. Hey, Eileen's a great girl. I love her. Congratulations, buddy. Thanks. Where's the stag party? Where else? Les Girls. Les Girls?! You'll never get in. It's all set up. Unbelievable! I knew a guy who knew this guy who got in there once. They have girls for everybody, man. You can have a girl and a steak and put them both on a credit card. Visa or Mastercharge. Yeah. Guys, I'm late for work. That'll be 5.50. You really think this looks good on me? It makes you look like Sting. This is all right. Yeah, yeah. I'll take it. Great. Here. Is it yours? Well, no, but it's my father's, and I reimburse him, so... Hey, great-looking jacket. Oh, you like this jacket? Oh, yeah. Actually, and Eileen, you can tell me if I'm wrong, I think it looks better on him than it does on me. You know, you're gonna get tons of use outta this thing. I wear mine all the time. You know what I really like? It fits really nicely across the back on you. Why don't you have a look in the three-way mirror? It's a nice garment. Listen, Eileen, I'm gonna go on my dinner break. I thought maybe you'd like to come along. It's on me. We can spend a little time... Harry, man, you hassling my woman again? Maybe some other time. You gonna buy something? No. Hi. Are you gonna buy that? What? I think it's too short. Think so? Yeah. Yeah, I gotta agree with him. This does not work. I don't think so. Definitely not. Eileen... Why do you do this to me? Eileen, I was trying to help. I told you not to come here when I'm trying to work. Here you are. Why are you smiling? Because I love you. You are a mess. You never think you're good enough for the one you love. But you aren't good enough. Aren't you gonna say something? It's go time, right now, you and me. Go back to Alexander High and instead of being my woman, you be my wife. What?! Eileen, I want you to marry me. Absolutely not. I just wanna get engaged. No! It's casual. What time did your flight get in last night? Mm, really late. I'm exhausted. Have you talked to Ron yet? Yes, I talked to Ron. I told him he could go jerk off, but I thought his hand would reject the merchandise. You did not. Of course I did. I can talk to him any way I want. Ladies. Hello. Hi. I'm Bill Conrad. I'm up in Unit 93. And you are...? Not interested. Hey, girls. Hey, Louie. Well... better get back to work. Marriage. Hm. I'm not getting married until I'm at least 35. I mean, married to some guy still in high school? Forget it. No, I am not getting married until I have my own car, my own place, and my own money. Absolutely. I totally agree. God, you look great! David's gonna lose his mind. I thought you said the place was phenomenal. It is phenomenal. It's great. I'm finally my own boss. But the problem is it's costing more than I figured. I need money. What you need is a big raise. You think Park'll give me one? Uh, no. What you need is a roommate, a guy who can take care of himself, stay out of your way and pay his own rent. Girls, please keep the ball in your own alley. Come on, getting a roommate kills the whole idea of living by yourself. Maybe you're just not ready yet. My cousin's 33, and he still lives at home. Maybe a roommate isn't such a bad idea. There you go. I know who. Ronnie Silverman. The guy idolized me in high school, his parents are rich. It's perfect. No, no. Ronnie Silverman got a scholarship. He moved away last weekend. Really? Fuck, yeah. Huh. He didn't even call me up. You need a roommate, Bill. I got it. John Simms. Bill, man, John Simms moved to San Francisco. He's a fag now. Think. Well, Tommy, would you like to be my roommate? I thought you'd never ask. Bill, it'd be an honor to be your roommate. See, it's not totally great yet, but it's almost there. Are you kidding? It's fantastic! It is a nice spread. It's the best place I've ever lived in. Are you sure you can afford this, Tom? My dad'll pay half. Good. He'll be glad to have me outta the house. We're gonna party every night. Oh, no, Tom. Contrary to popular opinion, I'm not on summer vacation. It was hard to get into this place, and I wanna stay here. So what we have to do is we have to lay down some ground rules. Fantastic shower! Tom, can you come out here so we can talk, please? See, the thing is, a lot of doctors live at this end of the complex, so we have to be quiet if we wanna stay here. Okay. Fantastic microwave, Bill! This is great, man. Did you hear about that lady who put a poodle in the microwave? It blew up. Gotta try that sometime. What are you doin'? Hey, don't go through my drawers. This is my room. The big room's mine! No way, Drake. That's not fair, man! Absolutely not. You're the guy who needed a roommate. You're the guy who needed the bread. Yeah. So, let's flip. Okay. Heads. You lose. Two out of three. No. Come on, two out of three. No. I found this place. Please? For you. Heads. You lose. You wanna clear your stuff outta the room? I can't believe-- Hey, Bill. Conrad, wait a minute. Listen, I'm gonna make it up to you. I want you to go to my stag party tonight. Isn't a stag party supposed to happen right before a wedding? Eileen and I are engaged. Oh. All Charlie's buddies-- everyone in his outfit-- he's the only one who never got shot. He's been on something like 20 missions, too. Charlie must've kicked some ass in 'Nam. Hey, don't say 'Nam. You call it Vietnam. Vets don't like it when regular people call it 'Nam. I wanna meet Charlie. I don't know if he wants to meet you. Charlie's a secretive guy. I pass his place almost every day. I never see him. He's not out playin' in the sprinklers. He's gotta come out sometime. It's not that easy. When he came back from 'Nam, he tried to cash a veterans' check. Someone spit on him in his own bank. Did he kill the guy? It was a girl. Shit! That's cold. Man, no one gave a damn about us back then, Tony. Hey, so what'd Eileen do when you asked her to marry you? She went wild. All right, man! All right. Cop patrol. All clear. Tom? Conrad... after Les Girls, you'll never be the same again. Okay. Bubba, how ya doin'? I'm lookin' for Steve. I'm Steve. Hi, Steve. You guys got I.D.? I'm gonna be straight with you. I'm gonna be 30 in a couple of weeks. This is a very important night in my life. You see, this is my stag party. Aren't you Tom Drake? Friend of the community. Hey, you were great in the regionals last year. Thanks, my man. Listen... it'll be 20 bucks for the four of you, and a three-drink minimum. Thanks, bud. Don't touch the girls. Live it up, guys. This is stag night. Ready to order now, honey? We'll have four of the Pineapple Surprises. ¶ ...can't quench my desire ¶ ¶ Don't you know that I'm burnin' up for your lovin' ¶ ¶ You're not convinced that that is enough ¶ ¶ I'll put myself in this position ¶ ¶ And I deserve the imposition ¶ This place, man, it's just like I pictured it. ¶ And this pounding in my heart ¶ Come here, baby. ¶ I'm burning up ¶ ¶ I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for your love ¶ ¶ I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for your love ¶ ¶ I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for your love ¶ Let's see your tits, baby. ¶ ...closing the door ¶ Well, it only makes me want you more ¶ ¶ Day and night, I cry for your love ¶ ¶ You're not convinced that that is enough ¶ ¶ To justify my point of view ¶ I love you! ¶ Want me to do ¶ I'm not blind ¶ Watch it!

I just can't leave. Look, I told my parents you were thinkin' about stoppin' by this week. Oh, really? Yeah, like we talked about? That might be good. You look nice tonight, David. Got some sun today. Stop. Look... I mean, why can't we have a regular date? Can't we just go somewhere? Honey, this is a regular date. I work nights.

It's casual. ¶ Bad luck, baby, the drink's on me ¶ Okay, I'd like all this, and some blowtorch fuel. Let's see what we've got here. This is okay. Uh-uh. You know what this is? This is a field bomb. No way. Sorry, little man. You've gotta be 18 to purchase weaponry. You know that. Those are dummy grenades. Here. How about an authentic marine jungle jacket instead? 44th Regiment, Vietnam. There was no 44th Regiment in Vietnam. This jacket is new. You're mistaken. Look, man, my buddy's a vet. I should take him down here to see this shit. This is bullshit. Please exit the store. This is the best summer we ever had. Quit moping, man. What's the problem? It's not like we have prison records. They let us go. We power partied, Bill. What's the problem? Excuse me. You have to be careful in this lovely pool area because of the sun-- it stays way, way late into the afternoon. Come here, sweetheart. What an adorable dog. Oh, God! Are you all right? You okay? Please go. I'm very sorry. Nging) Fashion Dynasty. Can I help you? Okay, there's a woman in 14 stuffing pants into her bag. Harry? Yeah. Listen to me. She was over at sunglasses. Now she's stuffing pants--men's pants. Where are you, Harry? I'm over here near the escalator. Harry... She started off with sunglasses. Now she's stuffing men's pants into her bag in 14. You see her? Harry, this is not a good time. I'm really busy. Could you do this? Look, this kind of thing happens all the time on this floor. I really think it would be a good experience for you if you handle this confrontation. Really? I'll be watching you. Okay. Excuse me, miss, but could you either put the merchandise you're carrying back or pay for it? I don't wanna have to call for security, but if I have to, I will. Guess who, baby. Tommy! I can't believe what you just did! That was a shoplifter, Tommy. You let her get away. Now I'm gonna get in trouble again because of you. Shoplifter... big deal. Would you get outta here? Hey, Eileen, I love you. You only say that when you think it's gonna take you places. That's not true, that's not true at all. Do you know where I was last night? Huh? I was depressed, alone. I was thinkin' of you. My friends wanted to take me to a strip club, but I didn't wanna go. I want you, Eileen. Tommy... I have work to do. Do you know what I give you that no other guy can deliver? What's that? Excitement. May I help you, Tom? No. Tommy, I think you'd better leave. I think you've bothered Eileen enough. He wants me to leave, Eileen. I'm not kidding, Tommy. I'm sick of your act. Either you leave or I'm gonna get somebody to throw you out. Okay. Fine. I think you better leave, Tommy. This could be yours, Eileen. I thought I told you... You didn't. It's empty. I know. But it could be filled with a ring for you. It's over between you and I. There he is there-- the guy in the blond hair. Eileen! Eileen! This could be you. Eileen! Eileen! Good night, Harry. Eileen, hang on for a second. I'm just doin' the sales from today. You're doing terrific work. Sit down. I'll tell you-- you're doing a lot better than I did when I started here. Well, thanks. You know, Eileen. You know, Eileen, I gotta tell ya. I think you're a real special salesperson, I really do. Sometimes I think about you and I wonder what it would be like to have you. Oh, no. I'm not kidding, Eileen. I'm crazy about you. I think about you all the time. I really do, constantly. I don't think so, Harry. Look, there's a place we can go here in home furnishings. It's totally secluded. Nobody will know we're there. No, Harry, I don't think of you that way. I turned you off. No... not really. I like you. I like working with you. No, I turned you off. I know when I turn somebody off. I turned you off. I think I better go. I'll just go. Is it my hair? It's not your hair. Good night, Harry. I broke up with Tommy in front of 50 shoppers. At least with Tommy, you know where you stand. David-- I can't depend on him. Sometimes he shows up. Most of the time, he doesn't. I think he just comes by when he's horny. You just can't let men take advantage of you. Have you tried calling him? I wanted to. But he told me I should be discreet. Discreet?! Discreet... that's for other people. Not you. I know. Well, the lights are on, Anita. Maybe his roommate Rick's there, huh? I think I'm gonna stay here in the car, okay? Can I help you? Hi. Is David here? He's out on patrol. What about Rick? Is Rick here? This is Rick. Hi. Are you sure you don't want to write a note or something? No. I'm sorry if I bothered you. That's all right. Bye. Bye. I know how you feel. I can't believe I let him lie to me like that. I have this poem that I've saved for a really long time, and... it used to mean a lot to me. I'll read it to you if you promise you won't laugh. Ugh... "If you love something, let it go. "If it comes back to you, it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was." That sucks, Eileen. Yeah, you're right. I guess I haven't read it for a while. No cop's gonna take me alive! Well, this is refreshing. You're a bigger slob than I am. Shut up. Magnum Force. I take it the cable installer came. This is him. Yo! I'm starvin'. He's right behind you, Clint. Did you know we had ants, Drake? No. I don't care. I'm gonna make myself a huge roast beef sandwich. Blow him away! Blow him away! Blow him away! Yeah! Thomas... Where's my food? Oh, I know. This is all that's left. You're gonna need some more food. We got babes comin' over later, too. They'll probably be hungry. I thought you were engaged. That's before we got this place. Now it's bachelor-rama. Yeah! This is not gonna work. Come on, Chief. We'll bring a girl for you, too. I don't want a girl. Pussy! Conrad... You know I partied before you asked me to move in here. Well, yeah, but it hasn't even been a week, and I've had partying up to my ass. Why so tense? Listen, when is the last time you've experienced the pleasure of a woman? None of your business. Hey, dude, you can tell us. Okay, I'm not the one goin' out with high school girls. He is. Listen, I'm going into my room. When I come out, I want some of my food back in the refrigerator, some of this trash picked up off the floor, and can you put some of my albums back in their covers, please? Okay. Okay? Okay, I will. I promise, Bill, I will. Thank you. Who are you?! Tommy said it was okay. It's not okay! Get out! Tommy said it was okay. Stay loose, Tom. Later. Come in. Oh, yeah, Unit 87, right? Ninety-three. Craig, you guys got my check, right? Oh, he's here... Yes, yes, we did. Bill, right? Yes, we did. Uh... you've got another fella living there with you, right? Yeah, we're splitting the rent. Works out pretty good. He's loud, isn't he? Well, I can talk to him about that. He listens to me. You see, you better look at your lease. We got another rate for two people. Wow. See, I didn't want a place that big to begin with. You knew that. Now look, Bill, we provide a service here. Either you pay for it or you leave. And if you leave, we keep the deposit. State rule, not mine. Well, that's bullshit. Listen, I like it here, and I wanna stay here. I've put up with every deposit and every increase because I wanna stay here. But I will not pay another cent. Don't get carried away. I'll talk to the owners about it, huh? All right? But do me a favor. Tell that kid to keep it down, and, hey, no parties, all right? No problem. Come on, Brenda, let's go back to my place. I don't wanna go now. All my friends are inside. Forget your friends. Well, then I have to go home. Don't worry. I'll get you home. Get in the car. I don't wanna go now. I said get in the car. Hey, it's that army kid again. Oh, my God. I'm gonna run his ass over. Eddie, don't! Shut up! Grow up, pinhead. Nobody likes you! Was she laughing? No. Fashion Dynasty. This is Eileen speaking. Can I help you? Hi, baby, it's me. Oh, it's you. Don't hang up. I just wanna see you tonight. That's impossible. Look at you. You're never gonna change. Why change? Eileen, I just wanna see you. I'm busy. And don't try coming by the department store. You're barred. Eileen, you're leaving me no alternative but to go out with other girls. All right. All right. Good-bye. I'm goin' to the coffee shop. You want anything, love god? It's casual. Be right back. Hey, Robin. Hi, Bill. Can you make me a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich? Oh, I suppose I could do that. Thank you. How's your boyfriend? He's okay... as boyfriends go. I would not know what to do in a situation like that. This is what you do: you clean it up, you pull your pants up, you say, thank you, ma'am, and then you bust her old man. Where's David? He's supposed to be here. You know where he's at. He's up fuckin' that skinny little girl at Donut City. He likes 'em in uniform. Well, he is from Sacramento. I wonder if he's got anything left for his wife? Give her a nice handshake. I'll have it drilled for you in 20 minutes. Okay. Thank you, Tommy. Where you goin', bro? Out. What are you doin', Conrad? I'm leaving. What do you mean you're leaving? You gotta work till 10:00 tonight. We got leaguers comin' in. I have to go. This is our bread and butter. You can't walk out on a league night. Okay. I'll be back later. Tommy can take care of things. You know I don't let Tommy touch the register. You're workin' late tonight. I am sorry, Park, man. I got plans. You got plans? Want some coffee? So, uh... What's fresh, huh? It was a joke. All right, look, I know I'm late. I got hung up with a four-car over on Lakewood. Are you married? Ha! What, are you kiddin' me?! I went to your house. Why did you do that? Because I missed you. Well, that's great. That's superb. Look, I didn't mess things up for you. You didn't have to go to my house. You had your fun. 91 Baker, 10-8. I wanna talk to you. What's the problem, son? Get out of your car. Let's talk about it like a man. I'm gonna arrest you like a man if you don't shut your mouth. Oh, big man. Foolin' around with a high school girl. I could have you arrested. Like I said, shut up. Get the hell outta here... You can do better than that for your little girlfriend, can't you, son? Listen, I don't know your girlfriend. You hear me? Fuck you! Shit! Shit! I think he's asleep. Knock. Um, Charlie, I brought a friend of mine to meet you. I don't wanna bother you or anything, so if it's a hassle, we can come back. No. Come on in. Tony, Charlie. How you doin'? Hi. You got a new TV. Bitchin'! Yeah. Some new ink, too. You don't wanna touch it. Charlie was at Khe Sanh, man. The 77-day siege. The V.C. buildup was so extreme, no one thought they'd make it. Right, Charlie? That's right. They shot at 'em for, like, 26 hours straight. Never got hit though. Isn't that right, Charlie? Jim, you probably know everything there is to know about Vietnam. Yeah, except what it was like to be there. Except what it was like to be there... and you're lucky about that, man. You know, you better get somethin' straight. I do not want to go back there. You keep thinkin' like that, you're gonna end up in El Salvador or Nicaragua, man, and you won't be watchin' Hueys and goin' "bitchin'." I've gotta go to the bathroom. You guys wanna drink a beer, there's some in the icebox. Thanks. Let's go. Charlie? We're gonna head out, Charlie. Charlie? Charlie, we're gonna go now. Hey, okay. Come back sometime. And bring your friend. He was cool! Everything about his place was cool! Wow! I should've said something. I blew it. No. He liked you. I could tell. This is where I live. Looks expensive. A lot of doctors live here. Yeah? It's pretty quiet, though, especially over on the northern corner. Wow! Yeah, it's nice. Bill, thanks for, uh... stickin' up for me tonight. It's really great. The guy pissed me off. Well, maybe now is a good time for us to try and get back together. Huh? Yeah. But on a trial basis, because... Oh, yeah. That's what I meant. Absolutely. Because then we can be completely independent yet together... Excuse me. Pardon us. Can't wait to show you my apartment. It's great. We can be alone. Can I ask you a personal question? Anything. Are you a virgin? Do you hear something? Yeah. Sounds like music. Look, you don't live here. We live here and we're trying to concentrate. Please turn the music down! Hey, what is this? Hey, man, this guy Billy Conrad's having a party. It's great. Tommy! Tommy? You throw a great party; just not enough room. Great party. Thanks. We gotta get these people outta here. I'm gonna get thrown out. Tommy! Hey, Mack! Mack... have you seen Tommy? I think he's in the laundry room. By the way, Chief, dude, man, you throw a great party. But I think you need a bigger pad. No! No! Vincent, no! You're not puttin' a poodle in the microwave. I just wanted to dry him out, man. Where's Tommy? You're lookin' really foxy, Penny. Tommy, I didn't even think you knew me. I know you. I do. Listen, I like you, but I don't think so. What's wrong? I just think you'd tell everybody. Penny, me? Do you know how that makes me feel, girl as beautiful as you sayin' that to me? That really hurts me, Penny. I never knew you were so sensitive. Well, I am. Tommy, listen, don't you have a girlfriend? She doesn't like me anymore. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go back out to the party. I think you invited too many people. Hi! Oh! Bill, man! Anita! Tom, where have you been? You really fucked up this time, Tom. We're doomed. It's not my fault, man. I just invited a few people. Look what happened. Doomed. Hey, face it. We're popular guys. Oh, God. See, everybody's enjoying themselves, buddy. Tom, they are going to throw us out! Anita, you are lookin' really foxy. Thanks. Where's Eileen? She doesn't like me anymore. Tom, have the cops come yet? What about Craig Davis? This is America, Bill. We pay, we stay, and they can't do anything about it, so I want you to live it up, stud man. This is the last summer blast. Tom! Nick! Tommy, Tommy! Tommy, I got me a woman! I got me a woman! I know a place that's a little more private. You lose. Take it off. Come on, Frank. Come on. Get 'em off. All right. All the way! Hey! Hey, Tommy! We're gonna split. There's no room to dance in here. No, you can't split. No, don't split. There's plenty of room here. What are you talkin' about? There's room here. There's room. We'll make room. Back it up. Back it up, back it up! Move outta the way! What am I talkin' about? We got a dance floor next door. We can do it again. One more time! Come on. That was only practice. We're gonna get it this time. Thomas! Thomas Drake! Dad? You're comin' home with me right now! Dad! Don't you ever stay away all night like that. Your mother's worried sick about you, for Christ's sake! Dad, I'm sorry. Come on! Get out. Bill, I'm sorry, man. I forgot to tell my dad I got my own place. It's casual. Don't you ever... don't you ever stay away all night like that. Follow me. Oh! Oh! Holy mother! Anybody hurt? That's too bad. Lawsuit. Oh, God! Wanna start with the kitchen? Ya know, somehow I had the feeling that things were gonna end up like this... just not so soon. Conrad, do you realize what went on in there last night? Yes. We had a major blowout. Well, so what? I mean, look where it got us. If you ask any one of those people ten years from now what the highlight of this year was, they'd have to say Bill Conrad's party. We gave them the best time they've ever had. So what? Don't you realize what you've done? What? You've made the transformation, buddy, from average guy to the Bill Man. You're a legend. No, no, no, no, no. Tom... Later. Eileen. How you doin'? Will you look at me? I've changed, Eileen. I heard about the other night. That wasn't me, Eileen. That was another guy altogether. Tommy, you're immature. Listen, I really care about you. Just give me another chance. Another chance for what? For a relationship. Come on. I'll give you a ride to History. I can be a gentleman. I'll see ya later, Tommy. Aah! Bill Man! Can I, uh, call you at home? Are you kidding? I'm gonna have a new place by this afternoon. Great! When's the first party? Just you and me. This year's gonna be so excellent! Hey, when we hang out this year, you gotta stop saying "excellent." Oh, I'm sorry. It's my fault. Thanks for getting my books. I'm so clumsy, I can't believe it. It's all right. Maybe I'll see you later... Jim. Yeah.
