Come on! Yeah, you're not getting my snowmobile. Son of a bitch! Ow. Hey! The delivery guy's here. Shit, woman. Nice shot, Rambo. Doesn't matter. Thanks. Oh, excellent. This is gonna be so cool. Hey, what'd you get? Ho ho ho, this thing is the berries. Check it out. Can you hand me that fly swatter? Yeah. Here you go. Oh, thank you. That sucks about your leg. Hey, I almost had him, you know. Now what would you have done if you actually caught up to him? I don't know. Something, anything. Maybe it's just as well you didn't. You tend to overreact, huh. Don't. Hello. Yeah. Oh, those brats. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yes, I know, thank you. Okay, thanks for the call. That was the sheriff's department. They found your snowmobile back down by the Garland Swamp. You know, I really don't like the idea of someone hanging around here and stealing things. Oh, Dorothy, you and I both know it's that doofus nephew of yours. He's your nephew too. Whatever. Hey, hey, you gonna go get my snowmobile? Maybe later, I got stuff to do. Oh, God. Oh, yeah. You strap one of these babies up to a tree and get a shot whenever something gets near it. Does it work? Of course it works. Here... check that out. What if someone steals it? For God sake, Dorothy, nobody steals these things. You buy a camera like this, you set it up right, you can get some of the most amazing shots. To the animal, it's invisible. Hm. Anyway, it's pretty cool. Now maybe I'll get a shot of that monster buck everyone's been blabbing about. I don't know, maybe even get it in a newspaper or magazine. There are people who pay money for that. Mm-hm. It's hard to believe that this is venison. Yeah, pretty good. More wine? Sure. Oh. Uh, hate to bring this up, honey, but how's that window-washing going? Oh, good one, that's your thing. I know, it was, but since I broke my leg, I just thought that... Oh come on, I hate doing windows. Fine. But it's gonna be after- - What? What the hell? What's going on? Uncle Hank? You okay? What the hell happened? Come on, let's get you up. Ow! Ooh. What are you guys doing out here? Did you have something to do with this? We were taking a shortcut, and we heard a buncha racket. What racket? I don't know, but it sounded pretty creepy. Ow. Ooh. Where's my bow? Huh? Give me my damn bow. Someone swiped my bow off the table. I chased his ass, but. What do you mean creepy? Well we heard some sort of yelpy kinda noise. We figured it was a coyote, but. I mean, probably had nothing to do with you. Did you see who it was? No. Me neither. Son of a bitch. Oh. I just got that bow this spring. That thing was a beaut. All right, come on, let's get you back to the house. Nice. Knock it off, huh. You're gonna break my damn table. Dude, that was awesome. I don't want you guys doing that anymore. Oh, man. Uh, I really got smacked. I can't believe someone would take my bow. Who the hell would do that? And why do you guys keeping messing with my snowmobile, huh? What? Hank, phone call for you. Hi, boys. You gonna come and finish your dinner? Yeah, yeah, I'll be right in. Mm, listen. Your Aunt Dorothy's been on my case to wash these damn windows. What do you say you guys do it? I'll pay. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I could use the cash. Good, good, I got some other stuff I need to get done. You got the stuff? Yeah. It's in the workshop. All right, yeah, I'm up for it. Yeah, me too. Good. Hey, hey... your Aunt Dorothy doesn't need to know about all this. Oh, look at you guys. This is awesome. Yeah, not bad, huh? Hey, where's Hank? He's out in the woods. He's setting up his new camera gizmo. Really? Yeah, he said something about getting a shot of a big buck. Motion detector triggers it. Oh yeah, I know all about it. Did he say when he'd be back? Nope. Figures. Would you mind if we finished this up tomorrow? Oh sure, yeah, you know, I shoulda just asked you fellas in the first place. Will you stop thinking about that damn camera and go to sleep? I put it in the perfect spot. All finished. Good deal. Aunt Dorothy said it's better than what you would have done. Of course she did. Hey, as long as she's happy. Hank, we should leave in a couple minutes. Be right there. Be happy when that cast comes off. Did you guys clean up all the crap? Pretty much. Cleaning is just as important as doing the job. Yeah, I know. See you boys later. Have you noticed we've been missing some chickens? No. Yeah. Yeah, something's not right. They wander all over the place. They could be anywhere. You know that. Well, sure, I know, but it seems kinda weird. God, this thing is driving me crazy! Me too. We're almost there. I can't wait to get home and just soak it and scratch the hell out of it. Mm-hm. Oh God. Well, maybe you'll learn something from all this, huh? What are you talking about? Driving my truck like that? Yeah, well, somebody had to find out what's been going on with my snowmobile. Oh God. Oh, oh. Is he okay? I don't know. Man, he came outta nowhere. Oh. Oh. All right, be careful. Is he dead? Afraid so. Slow down, asshole! That's too bad, ugh. Yeah, a beautiful animal. Kinda strange seeing a deer around here this time of day. Yeah, I guess so. Is the car okay? Busted headlight. Something musta been chasing it. Oh hey, hey, hey, we gotta go. Yeah. You know, after your doctor's appointment, I think I just might come back and grab him. Hate to see that meat go to waste. Dude, it's so sweet that your parents let you use the jeep while they're outta town. Yeah. So who do you think stole Uncle Hank's bow? I don't know. That was weird. Yeah, seems like we should try and find it for him or something. Suit yourself, man, I gotta work at four. You know, we could have some serious fun with him? What do you mean? That camera he put out in the woods? Yeah? Seems pretty jacked to get a photo of that big buck he's been talking about. What are you saying? I don't know, do something stupid with it, whatever. You mean like moon him? Exactly. Do you have any idea where it is? I assume it'd be down by his deer blind somewhere. Dude, we gotta find it. I don't know. I feel like he'd be pretty pissed. Uncle Hank, you kidding me? He's a good sport. Yeah, all right. Just real quick. Oh my. Oh that's coming off pretty nicely already. Here. You ready? Mm-hm. That's good. Okay, easy. There. Oh, oh, hallelujah. Seems like I've had that thing on forever. Yeah, here, this might help. Oh, wow, thanks. Oh, oh, yeah, that feels good. Well now, looks like everything's okay. You wanna take it easy for a while, you know. Don't overdo. Well, you heal quickly. Well that's great. All set then? Hank wants to harvest some roadkill. We hit a perfectly healthy deer on the way over here, down by Garland Swamp on 29. Seriously? Okay, look, I'm not one to normally grab stuff like this, but it was a clean head kill. Yeah, it's a wonder we don't have worms. You know, the only weird thing was, it had these kind of, I don't know, these gashes. Hank, he's not a veterinarian. It wasn't caused by the car, that's for sure. Let's go home, I wanna get back. The doctor has more important things to do. I thought maybe he might know something, that's all. Oh, thank you very much. It feels great. Just try and take it easy for a while, okay? Yeah, I'll do just that. You take care. Yeah, take care. Oh hey, those gashes you were talking about. Yeah. My neighbor's dog had just the same thing a little while ago. I saw them. They looked like claw marks. Now that's what I thought. Come on, Hank, okay, you coming? Hey, I wanna talk to this fella. Actually, it's a woman, Frances Wellman, the artist. Look her up. She's on Oak Street. Hey, you coming? Yes, uh, thank you. There it is. Dude, get over here. That thing'll snap your picture. It didn't get it? - No, I don't think so. We're outta range here. Here you go. You do it. He's your uncle. Plus, it was your idea. No way, dude, you do it, I don't wanna. Fine. How do I look? Like an idiot. Perfect. All right, I'll be right back. Fine. Getting your wheel back. We are stopping and getting some groceries first. Hey, why don't you get your doctor friend to help you? I'm gonna get that deer. You are such a jerk. Okay, lift up your head a little bit. Little bit more. Okay, now raise up your hand. Bingo. All right. Come on back. Dude, he's gonna crap his pants. What was that? Man, I don't know, but that thing was big, whatever it was. Let's get the hell outta here, fast! Come on, go! Come on! Hey, dude, wait up! Come on, let's go. Let's go! I think it was around here. No, no, it's farther down. Maybe so, maybe so. Here. No, there, it was right there. Aw, looks like someone beat you to it. Dammit. That thing woulda dressed out at 150 easy. That's too bad, honey. Well, hey... we should get going. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? I'm just gonna check it out real quick. Honey. It was right there. I'm sure it won't go to waste. See that? Something dragged that poor thing into the woods. Looks like it. Wonder what could have done that. I don't know. Couple things, I guess. Come on, let's go, I wanna get home. I'm just gonna take a peek and follow the tracks. Hank, I don't think that's a good idea. Hank! It's time to go! Shit. Shit. Hank! Come on, Hank! Let's go! Geez, Dorothy, take it easy. You scared the hell out of me! All right, sorry. So, did you find them? No, and I went way the heck back there too. Oh. I did find this, though. Oh, that's not good. What is it? I don't know. Seems kinda fresh. Come on, let's go. Oh. Oh, Dorothy. Aw, that's good. What are you doing? Oh, good God, woman. This is a serious wound. I need to know how it happened. Honestly, at first I thought someone was playing a prank on us. This is no prank. No, it wasn't. So what's the explanation? It was huge. Like... I don't know, like a big wolf or something. I know it sounds weird, but. Look, we've got no reason to make this stuff up. I'm gonna need sutures to close this wound. Whatever you say. You're lucky. It didn't get down into the tendons. Did you call the police? No. They need to know about this. You know, something doesn't feel right. Yeah, well, you almost had your arm torn off. Yeah, I know. It's gonna hurt for a while. You know, they're gonna keep asking us what it was. So? So, what do we tell them? The truth, that maybe something escaped from the zoo or something. I hadn't thought of that. Whatever it was, somebody's gotta catch it. The police are on their way. Apparently there have been sightings, but you're the first actual attack. They definitely wanna talk with you guys. All right. You can wait right here. Thanks. I understand you guys had a little excitement. Sounded pretty nasty. Yeah, it is. Why don't we just start with the basics, your name? Sam Reynolds. Age? 17. And you? Jeshen Purvis, 17. Spell Jeshen for me. J-E-S-H-E-N. So you were with Sam here when this happened? I sure was. Wanna tell me what you saw? Sam and I were out in the woods by the Garland Swamp, around two, I guess, and, we heard a buncha noise. Then something came outta nowhere and grabbed me. So that was this afternoon at two, huh? Around two, yeah. Why, is something special about that? We had another report come in about that same time. Someone else saw it? Apparently, a hunter was checking on his blind. He didn't know what it was, got kinda freaked and called 911. You know, this is really starting to hurt. Holy crap. I'll get someone. Dude, take it easy, okay. This isn't good. No, dude, breathe, breathe, breathe. You okay? Breathe, breathe, take it easy. Doc? Pain medication wearing off? Don't let it do that. The first couple of days are gonna be tough. This wasn't a clean cut. I'm really scared. Try to relax. Give it a second. It already feels. I just have a few more questions. I have to know what attacked you. I've never seen anything like it. It was... big and it mighta had hair like a dog or a wolf or something. How big? Bigger than us. Maybe it just seemed bigger because it was so, um. Come on, you guys, spit it out. All right. I thought it was a gorilla or something. Then I figured it had to be more like a really big dog. Like one of those loose ones that runs around sometimes. A feral dog? Except it, except it was standing on its hind legs. When it grabbed Sam. I knew it was no dog. So what was it? I don't know. But it was really big and strong. It had like these bright yellow eyes. See, I knew you wouldn't believe it. No, I believe you. It's the same description that the hunter gave. Mm, mm. Hmm, sure feels good to be home without that cast. I still feel bad about your truck. Are you kidding? The back end doesn't squeak anymore. I'm just glad you're okay. You should call the police about that rag. - Maybe, I don't know. It's probably nothing. I don't think finding a bloody piece of cloth in the woods is nothing. Call them. Five minutes a day, and there are no barriers to it. You keep it next to your bed, keep it in your kitchen, wherever is convenient for you. With that convenience and effectiveness, people... And we want them on a 40-day program. About 10 days on each ball. Come in. Oh. Oh. I'm Officer Samels. Are you really? Wow, Hanklin Purvis, thanks for coming over. Are you new? Six months, seems longer. Huh. So you found something you thought we'd be interested in? Oh, I sure did, yeah. You know, I don't know if it's really anything. Where'd you find this? Off 29, out in the woods. Between here and town? Just a couple of miles from here really, out by Garland Swamp. What were you doing out there? Had to take my wife into town, hit a deer. I was gonna get it on the way back, but it was gone. So I followed the tracks out into the woods. It's, it's kinda near my hunting blind, well sort of. Did you find the deer? No, no... just the cloth. You're gonna need to show me the spot. Yeah, no problem. You mean now? Yeah, now. There's been an attack. We can't wait till tomorrow to find out what's going on. What do you mean attack? Something went after a young man, gave him a couple of nasty gashes. This might be connected. Yeah, yeah, okay, let me grab my jacket. This is Deputy, um... Samels. Oh, I'm Dorothy. I'm with him. She wants me to show her where I found the cloth. Oh. Well, it was nice to meet you. Kinda late, isn't it? Ma'am, this can't wait. Can't wait, so, be back in a jiffy. It's right up here on the right. You just past it. Yeah, right back there. Maybe we should wait until morning to do this. Don't worry, this sucker's got two and a half million candle power. Okay, all right, all right, let's just take a quick look. Sh. What? That's nothing. There are a lotta noises this time of night. Let's just get on with it, okay? Well, it's right over here. Here. This is the spot. Will you shut that damn thing off? Yeah. Did you find anything else? No. Just the cloth. What was that? Now that I don't know. I've seen enough. We'll come back here tomorrow. Hey, the trailcam, it might have photos of it. We're leaving. Fine. Hello, boys. Morning. I suppose you want your money. If you got it. You were right. Your Aunt Dorothy loved the windows. I thought they were a bit streaky myself, but hey, I didn't have to do it, and she's happy. Cripes, what happened to you? I got attacked by some frickin' animal. What? Yeah, I was out in the woods just south of town. By my hunting blind, out by the swamp? Yeah, kinda. Damn, that was you? I heard about that. Are you all right? Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna go out there anytime soon again, that's for sure. What were you knuckleheads doing out there, anyway? This thing just came outta nowhere and nailed him. I mean, he got like 26 stitches. Yeah, I got these two huge gashes. There really is something out there. What it look like? I don't know, it happened really fast. You saw it, though, right? Not very well. I don't know, it was like a wolf or something. I don't know, whatever it was, it was big and it was pissed off. I was out there last night with the cops. I think I have a piece of your shirt. Yeah, that was probably mine. I can't believe that was you. Those woods freak me out. Oh, I don't know. I've had a hunting blind out there for years. Never seen anything like this. There's something going on there now. Let me see your arm. Watch it. Sorry. 26 stitches, huh? Oh! What are you doing sneaking around? Me? What are you doing, what is going on? Where are the chickens? - Well how should I know. Did you look behind the barn? - Yes, I've looked everywhere. I can't find the chickens. Okay, that's impossible. The snowmobile's gone again too. Unfriggin' believable, are you kidding me? Hey, where are you going? Oh, it's like the fifth time those boys have taken the damn thing, I'm sick of it! Hank! Hank. Oh my God, Hank! Hank, my God, Hank! Oh my God. Can you get out, honey? Honey? Oh my God. Come on, honey. Come on, let's go. Let's get away from the truck. What'd you do, hit something? Come on, come on. Oh God, honey. Oh. Oh my God. Honey, are you okay? Oh my God, you coulda been trapped in there, honey. Is anything broken? Are you bleeding anywhere else? Hank. Hey. Something was in the bed of my pickup truck. It stood up. I... I saw it in the rearview mirror. Whoo, kinda took me by surprise. The only thing I thought to do was shit my pants and roll the damn truck. Don't look at me like that. Well. Where would it have gone, huh? Oh, well, um. Whoo, uh, I don't know, I don't know. It, uh, would have probably been thrown off in this way. Whoa. Whatever it was, it looks like it bounced right here. Oh my God. I'm gonna call for help, huh? Uh-huh. Oh, son of a bitch. Well, here, this'll make you feel better. That was a damn good truck. I'm such an idiot. Mm. You make the best pies. Even kinda make shit like this tolerable. I need to have you initial here and here, and sign at the bottom. What is that? It's the accident report. I wrote down what you told me. It's for the files, plus the insurance company will wanna see it. They're gonna think I'm nuts. I left out the part about what you saw in the mirror. Thanks. Gonna wanna look it over anyway and make sure I've got it just right. Hey, you want a piece of pie? Got one just outta the oven. Go for it, it's awesome. Yeah, I guess, thanks. Earlier this evening, something killed a goat over at the Murphy farm. They found it all torn up by the edge of the woods. Left the same tracks as what I saw here tonight. What the hell is this thing? I don't know. What should I do? Just sit tight. I'll get out tomorrow and try to track it. Maybe grab your trail camera. Want me to go with you? No, thanks. I can. You have enough going on. You know, I was heading over to Garland Swamp in the truck. What for? Retrieve our snowmobile for the fifth time. That was you guys? Thought my dumb-ass nephew was messing with me, but now... I'm not so sure. Garland Swamp is right next to where a couple of these boys got attacked. Yeah, I know. That was my nephew and his buddy. No kidding? I met him at the hospital. How's he doing? Okay, I guess. Sure put a scare into him. Okay. Here you go. Smells great, thanks. Mm-hmm. Well? Excellent. Oh, no, I mean about the- - Oh, still too soon to tell what it was. Can you show me where you keep your snowmobile? Oh, yeah, sure. It's over there in the barn. Here. Thank you. Ow, oh. Okay, it's just in here. I don't stinkin' believe it. I had the snowmobile chain wrapped around this I. It looks like this lock held. You know, another thing, we had 20 or 30 chickens running around here. They're all gone. Chickens? Yeah, there's other stuff missing from around here too. Like what? I don't know, buckets, tools. I had a pile of burlap sacks over there, they're gone. I used to think I was just losing things. Now I'm not so sure. Looks like this was just torn apart. It's kind of an old chain. I don't know. A chain's a chain. You know, my compound bow is missing too. I'll get back with you tomorrow. Let me know how I can help. - You might just wanna... take it kinda easy for a while. May I help you? Oh, hi. I'm sorry to bother you. You know, I may be all screwed up with this whole thing, but... was it your dog that got hurt by that animal attack? It was horrible. So it is you? She was a great dog. Was? She died. Oh no. I still don't know what happened. She was- I'm Frances Wellman. Hank, Hank Purvis. You want some lemonade? Yeah. This is September. And it was like I said. This happened last July. Like around nine at night, I think. My wife was coming home from shopping. She came around the corner to our driveway, and there it was. She smacked right into it. That's when I heard her screaming. Then I ran out to see what's going on. I didn't see anything myself, but she was freaked out for sure. Plus, the car had a dent in the front where she hit the damn thing. I come running up the car, and she was shaking real bad. I tried to calm her down, but I didn't have much luck. Later, she told me it was a large dog, standing up on his hind legs. She said it had these bright yellow eyes. I told her it musta been the headlights. Now I'm... I'm not so sure. Hey, Sam, how you doing? Did you get any sleep? I'm feeling kinda dizzy, actually. Did you call your folks? They're... still up in Canada. They're gonna be back tonight. They're pretty freaked. I guess so. You don't look so good. You okay? Can I get you something? Uh, maybe some water. I feel terrible. Did you take those painkillers? Yeah, but it's not that. At first, I thought she'd be okay, you know. The wound was bad, but nothing life-threatening. The next day, she just slept the whole time. Then the seizures started. And before I knew it, she just slipped away. That's really horrible. She was my baby. I'm really sorry. Thank you. My nephew's friend was just attacked out in the woods. Sounds like it might be the same kinda deal. Is he all right? The doctors are caring for him. I hit a deer out on 29. It had a couple of gashes on it. My dog had two gashes. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, all these things kept happening. Never thought to think how it might tie together until I heard about your dog. Well, your nephew's friend, did he see what it was? Well, I asked him the same question, and, uh, when it got down to it, they said it looked like a big dog. That, uh, stood on its hind legs, sounds crazy, huh? I kinda saw it too. Last night, I know it sounds nuts, but there was something in the bed of my pickup truck. It was sleeping or something, but it stood up and it startled me. I crashed the damn thing. Good heavens. Yeah, it was quite surprising. We have to tell somebody. The police. Hello. I'll be right there. What's the matter? My nephew's friend who was attacked by that thing, we... he's back in the hospital. I gotta go. Can I come too? Yeah, you should. What happened? Looks like he's having a reaction to something. I saw him yesterday. He seemed okay. Yeah, I know. Something's up. We've taken some blood, and we're running a number of tests. I wanna quarantine him until we can figure out what's going on. Is he gonna be okay? We've got him stabilized, but he's pretty sick. Doctor, my dog had the same injury. She seemed like she was recovering, and then, all of a sudden, she got really sick, started having seizures and she- - She died. This is a person we're talking about. I know. But he has the same symptoms, and my dog was dead in two days. All right, everyone, outta here. Where are Sam's parents? He said that they'll be home later tonight. They're still up in Canada. We gotta call them right away. The number's gotta be on his cellphone. I can probably go find it and call them. Good, good, and then give it to the hospital. Okay. Jeshen? Why do you think he was attacked? I don't know. We were out in the woods, and then... bam. I just got the call. What's going on? Well, he was doing fine, and then like an hour ago, he started having trouble. Where were you going with that? If the boys didn't provoke the attack, then something else is going on. I'm sorry, who are you? Her dog was attacked just like Sam. Have you been out to where this has happened? Mr. Purvis went out there, didn't see anything. Maybe you didn't know what to look for. Can you take me out there? We need her. All right. I need to pick up something at my house first. Sure, come on. I'll drive. What's with the book? It's a scrapbook from my grandmother. I used to read it when I was a kid. So? So I think I remember something being in here. Are you saying that this stuff's happened around here before? Maybe. 61, 61, base. 61. 61, we've got a report of a bicycle PIA south on 27. You in that area? I am. How far south? The caller wasn't sure exactly. 10, 12 miles from town. I'll keep my eyes open. 61, clear. Here it is. I knew it. What? Wow. What's it say? She says there is a dog-human-like creature who when threatened delivers a wound that festers and eventually kills. Like cats? When they scratch, they've got some nasty bacteria or something. We should call the hospital. Yeah, yeah. I'll call Jeshen. Jeshen, hey, you at the hospital? Okay, well, when you get there, you find a doctor and you call me right back. We'll be there as soon as we can. Base, 61. 61, base. I'm on the scene of bicycle PIA on 29, stand by. 10-four. Oh. Oh wow. Whoa. Get me the hell outta here! Take it easy, fella. Oh no. A giant dog attacked me. Bashed him in the face with my water bottle. There's his tooth over there. Oh God, oh. Holy shit, he really did. I need an ambulance, Highway 29, 12 miles south of town. Bicyclist injured, conscious, obvious broken leg and contusions. Jeshen? Good, put him on. Doc, Doc, I think we may have found out something about this gash business, here. - Hi, this is Frances Wellman. We met at the hospital. There is something toxic on the claws of the dog. Some kinda germ or bacteria or something. Okay, all right. What are you doing? As bad as that is, that's not the problem, right? What are you talking about? We have to rinse that gash out. There's something deadly in it. Do you have anything strong? Are you crazy? I got this. - Perfect. - Oh hell no. - No, no! - Here, here, here. Hold him down. Wow, that's gonna burn like a son of a bitch. Oh hell no! Oh God. Compound fracture. Check this out. We rinsed it with this. Next time, you oughta let us do that. That gash will fester and probably kill him in 48 hours. It's some kinda dog bite, so treat it like rabies. Alcohol's all we had. Get me away from these idiots. Hey, you might wanna listen to her, okay? We gotta go. We've seen things like this before. I don't think so. Okay, slow down, it's right up here on the right. Doesn't look so bad in the daylight. Oh my God. What? She calls it Dogman. It actually says Dogman? Dogman. You know, you hear stories of that when you're a kid, but you never think it's true. We need to get going. Come on. Can you just give me a second? I just need... You can read it later. All right, let's go. Now that's where I found the torn sleeve. I know. We're being watched. We need to go. Ooh, let me snag my camera. We need to leave, now. It's just right here. Oh no. What is it? Look at this. Maybe I got a shot of the bastard. Time to go. Be very quiet. Let's just carefully... and quietly follow the trail out of here. Run! Run. Okay, okay, okay. Get in. You're okay, sh, you're okay. You're okay. All right, sh. What the? Come on, get the hell outta here. The keys are gone. Tell me you have a spare. Ah. Back at the station. This is 61. This is 61. Give me your cellphone. It's in the woods. Shit. You got a phone? My snowmobile. What about it? I never picked it up. So, so it's probably still at the swamp. The swamp? Yeah, I know, but Garland Swamp is just over past those trees over there. Oh! I'm sorry. This is insane. Okay, all right. Stay where you are. I'll be right back. We gotta find something to rinse that out. Keep the car locked. Stay put. Shit. Come on, come on. Ah, ah. I don't know about that. It's better than nothing. You know we gotta get that rinsed out. Ready? All right. Son of a bitch, she found it. Take it easy, take it easy. Come on. Okay, hop on. There's no way all three of us are gonna fit on this thing. Okay, I'll stay back. No, absolutely not, ah! He needs to get to the hospital. Get on. I don't feel good about this. You go. I'll be okay. No. July Seventh, 1927. Mashemous came home from hunting tonight, bringing three fine rabbits. He spoke of seeing a large mad dog in the woods, standing on its hind legs, keeping him from returning home on the usual trail. Instead, he took the path past the swamp and found his way home in the dark. After telling us about it, he told us to stay out of the woods. After chores, my younger brother, George, and I snuck out of the house to see for ourselves. On the trail, we found a piece of bloody fur and ran home. July Eighth, 1927. We learned that people from our community have been attacked by this creature. They seem fine for a day or so then fall very sick. One of them, Aunt Phineous, lays near death. I think I'm gonna puke. Don't do that. Just hang on. July Ninth, 1927. Last night, Grandma gave Aunt Phineous a poltice of boiled green moss she said was fertilized by droppings from the creature. She was so close to death we feared for the worst. A few hours later, the potion took and Aunt Phineous woke up. What the hell is going on? Oh my God, Hank, Hank. He got clawed. We need to get him to the hospital. I got him. Get in the car. What happened? Tell me what happened. We wanted to bring Frances to the spot where the boys got attacked. Frances, who's Frances? She's somebody in town whose dog was killed. It had the same gashes that Sam has, and now Hank. Where is she? Back at the woods, we had to leave her in my car. The keys are missing. What? What are you doing? We need to get him to the hospital. No, no, no. We are not leaving her out there alone. Hold on. Buckle up. You're okay. You're okay. I'll go check. If she's not there, we're heading straight to town. Got it? Ow. Can you see her? No. Aw, shit. No sign of her. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Where could she have gone off to? I can't believe you left her alone out here. She was supposed to stay put. This is horrible. Right now, we just need to get his ass to the hospital. I'll come back later with some help. You okay? It hurts like a bitch. Don't worry, we'll get you to the hospital in just a minute. Oh my God, it's Frances. What? Oh my God. Frances. What the hell were you doing? I told you to stay put. Never mind, just drive. I've got it. This is the antidote. Oh my God, you scared the hell out of us. What do you mean the antidote? It was in my grandma's scrapbook the whole time. Moss? It's not just any moss. It's moss from where the creature lived. I see that stuff all over the place. Yeah, this is different. You mean the creature's been pissing on it? You gotta be kidding me. I'd be up for anything, ah. Oh no. What do you do with it? You mash it up, put it right on the wound. Don't you worry, honey, we'll get you all fixed up. Maybe it'll help Sam too. I hope so. I can't believe you went back in the woods, alone. I wasn't alone. So what happened back there? Hey, maybe you'll get famous after all. Ah.
