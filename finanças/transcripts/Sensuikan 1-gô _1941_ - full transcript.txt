Bow! As you were! Install! The moral training today is, subject the eleventh that you expected, that is, duty. The story of Captain Sakuma Therefore we use this library, Sakuma- shoin, especially for our class room Open the page 52. As you know well, Captain Sakuma was born this place, Yamura village, Mikata county, Fukui prefecture. That is, he is your senpai (senior) in your hometown. In this very room, the captain as child was taught reading and writing by his father, Sakuma Yoshimori sensei. This building was converted to the library from the original one-story house. You must be proud of it. You must keep attention today more than usual. Learn the spirit of Captain Sakuma. Do you understand? Yes sir. Katagiri Takeshi, Read the part of today. Subject 11: One's duty Meiji 43 (1910) April 15th, Meiji 43 (1910) April 15th, the 6th submarine cleared the land of Yamaguchi for training. 10 AM, the boat went to underwater, soon an accident happened and the water came in. The boat began to sink with 14 crews. The captain ordered the crew to stop the water coming in. Meanwhile they tried to remove the water, but the electricity was gone out. But the inside of the boat was pitch-dark. Electric power was useless, so they used manual pump desperately. The boat could not surface. A faint hope was that the mother ship might notice and come to rescue. But the communication to the mother ship was dead. No hope. Soon gas started to generate. Breathing became painful. His men collapsed one by one. No hope. The captain started to write in a small light leaking from conning tower. It was his will written with pencil on pocket book. Due to my carelessness, I lost the submarine and the men of His Majesty. I am truly sorry sir. However, the men has performed perfectly their duties and acted calmly till dead. We are satisfied to die for the nation, however, one regrettable thing is that, due to this failure the further progress of submarine might be hindered. I ask you all, do not misunderstand us and try harder for the progress of submarine. If you do, we have nothing to regret at all. In his will, he stated his apology to the Emperor first that he lost the boat and the men, that the men performed their duties perfectly, that he didn't want to delay the progress of submarine due to the accident. He stated how to start sinking, what happened in the sea bottom in details. He asked to take care of the surviving families of the men. listed the names of his superior officer, senpai and respected teacher, and finally he wrote "12:40". When the sunken boat was salvaged, it was obvious that the captain and his 13 crews had been performing their duties till dead. The will was found in jacket of the captain. Lesson: Do your best and leave the rest to Providence. Good I think you have learned well already. What do you think about the story of Captain Sakuma? If you have an idea raise your hand. Hidaka Shinsaku. Captain Sakuma cared about the Japanese submarine until the last moment. So we must create the best submarine in the world and make the captain relaxed. That's what I thought first. As you heard, the idea of Hidaka is wonderful. This is the model of the 6th submarine. In the modern eyes, this is so small, looks like a toy. Captain Sakuma tried to correct the defects of this poor submarine and improve the submarine to be useful for the nation. To achieve the purpose, he dared dangerous experiment as underwater navigation with gasoline. During the experiment he met the accident and lost his life. Creating a competing submarine in the world for the progress of Japanese submarine means, it will appease the soul of Captain Sakuma and contribute our nation also. Is there any other idea? Katagiri. My idea is same as Hidaka's, however, making a good submarine is not enough. It will be useless without a number of good sailors like Captain Sakuma and his crews, who can perform their duties. So I will be a good crew of submarine like as Captain Sakuma and the crews. Katagiri is going to be a crew of submarine? Yes sir. I will be a captain of submarine. Don't laugh. The idea of Katagiri is as good as Hidaka's. We must create the best submarine, meanwhile we must need the best sailors too. Otherwise, if a war begins, it is useless. Captain Sakuma concerned about this particularly. So he selected the best among the best for the crews of submarine. He emphasized the splendid performance of his men. So, as Katagiri has said just now, to become a good crew of submarine means to follow the captain's will as well. Now I can say Hidaka and Katagiri have learned the spirit of Captain Sakuma. As a teacher I am very satisfied. Mother, I'd like to ask you something. What is it? Let me go to naval academy. Naval academy? After I graduate the junior high school in Obama, let me go naval academy. Mother, please. I beg you for my life. Why did you say such thing suddenly? No, I have been thinking to go to naval academy. Today I have promised. Promised to whom? Hidaka, the class president. Shinsaku-san? I understand your decision very well. However, Shinsaku, Junior high school is all right. But if you go to a university in Tokyo, how can you manage your educational cost? I think you understand the livelihood of your uncle's house here. Uncle, I am going to work and study. I will not be your burden, uncle and aunt. Uncle, please. You say you will work and study, Shinsaku, but the world is not so easy as you think. I understand sir. But I accept any hardships. I want to try even if how hard it is. Dear, Shinsaku's father left a small piece of land. If you do something with that... Yes, I know. But we don't know what will happen. If possible I don't want to sell the land. Besides, when Fumie is getting old she will go to marry. We need the money for her wedding. Oji-san (uncle), I don't need the money at all. Please use it for brother's education. Oji-san, I will work hard and help you and aunt. So, please, oji-san. I determined to go Tokyo Imperial University, then Edajima Military School like Captain Sakuma and become a naval officer. I see. I understand. Good, very good. If you determined so, mother will allow you anything. You can go to the naval academy or anywhere you want. Then mother, you gave me a permission. Mother, thank you. You convinced me again that you are the son of your father. I will go mother. Where to? Going to the grave of Captain Sakuma. What? Yes, I promised with Hidaka. We will report our determination in front of the grave of Captain Sakuma. Hidaka! Hidaka! Katagiri! How about you? My mother gave me a permission at once. I took a time, but uncle gave me a permission at last. Did he? Good. Now, let's to take an oath in front of Captain Sakuma. Captain Sakuma, I make a vow that I will be a captain of submarine. and dedicate myself to Japanese submarines. Captain Sakuma, I devote myself to our nation by creating the finest submarine. Thus, time has passed, Hey, Katagiri, Where to? Yokohama? No, Tokyo. I am going to meet an old friend after long. Marine engineering Department This way please Is Hidaka doing well? Yes he is studying so hard. He studied all night often. All night? That's great. Please. He will be back soon. Please be relaxed. Thank you. Hey! Hey! Did you wait long? No. I've just arrived. Good. So long time no see. Yes we are. Katagiri, stand up. What? Yes, and take a cap. It is the first time to see you wearing uniform. Oh, yes. You are right. Look. All right. In the uniform you look great. Not look like a chick of officer. But at least I could be a chick of officer. I will go for ocean navigation soon. That's good. When you depart? 10 O'clock AM tomorrow. Depart from Yokosuka. I can't see you for long. So I bought this. Good, thank you. Sukiyaki set for 5 persons. I have two years to go till graduation. I will study harder. Yes do it. But don't push yourself too hard. All night study is not good for your health. No, this is not study but a moonlight job. Moonlight job? I am translating on subcontract. Before then I had a good job of tutor. You are walking in hard way. No, it's not so hard. Don't you know my guest? He left early this morning. He did? I see. Hasty guy. Shinsaku, study hard. But take care of yourself as well. I will go for ocean navigation. I will be back with heavy suntan. Be well. Years later, Katagiri Takeshi was promoted to lieutenant and studying hard day and night as a second class student of Kure Submarine School. Submarine School of Navy The enrollment of the Submarine School of Navy were classified in two, students and trainees. The students were naval warrant officers constituting of future captain, chief engineer and senior officers. The trainees were enlisted persons constituting of future submarines crews. Katagiri, Lecture will start soon. Let's go. A commander of submarine will meet a number of occasions, that he must judge by himself and act calmly even if he cannot get any instructions. That is a reason that a commander of submarine is demanded to be especially keen and cool. Test of generated gas by trainees Battery test work by trainees Training of drainage Training of operation Training of torpedo tube operation Training of anti-aircraft gun operation Training of hand flag signal Kure Suiko-sha Lieutenant Katagiri, a gentleman called Hidaka-sama visiting you sir. You looked so different. I got a job. What job? Job at a design section of shipbuilding yard in Kobe. How nice. So I came to greet chui-dono (lieutenant). Now I can work heartily. Make the best submarine as soon as possible. I do. By the way, when are you going on board submarine? Maybe within half year. Now both of us are on the right way. But long way to go. Let's go for it. Currently I am in hard training as senior officer of submarine Hirei. Lieutenant colonel Hayami has noble character and caring us like father, in addition, I respect his passion toward submarine. Captain Yoshimura has well-round character with remarkable skill. He should be call the best captain truly. No more happiness than working under them. from Katagiri Takeshi. Time up. Stop underwater navigation. Draining all right. Sennin shoko (Senior officer), Are you used to the foods of submarines? Very good sir. Don't flatter. Here, the senior officers and enlisted persons eat same foods. Maybe it is only in submarine. It is very homey. Submarine is like a family. Everyone is a member of family. Yes, captain. By the way, senior officer, Your mother's writing is very young. I was surprised to see her letter to you. It was someone wrote. I see. I thought you are only son, but you have already has a good one to write for your mother. Well, it is a sister of my best friend living close. Sister of best friend? That's good. We share life and death in the submarine. I will congratulate you like family. We had a good time the other day. Let's go again. But next time, I will guide you. Give me a light. Good taste. What's good? Sashimi. What sashimi? Sashimi of air. I want to share this nice sashimi of air with people on land. Yes, I know what you feel. Sennin shoko (senior officer), Your hometown is same as Captain Sakuma's, isn't it? Yes sir. Mikata county in Fukui prefecture. Then you know Obama very well. Sure sir. I went Obama junior high school. Captain, please give saisen (money offering) to Konpira god. You too please, senior officer. Chief engineer, please. Thank you sir. Look, 5 man-yen. I heard that, in April, the Navy decided to navigate around Maizuru and Obama. Is it navigation of courtesy for Captain Sakuma? Yes, we will drink a toast for the statue of Captain Sakuma. That's grateful. So you can see your mother then. Yes I do. Thank you. And meet the young writing girl too. (Konpira God is a god for Sea and Water.) Did you all gave saisen money? I will do. Look, a fishing boat! Hey, take this keg. We ask you. This is captain's saisen (money offering) keg. Please take care of the keg. Count on me. Hurry. Obama Park in Fukui Prefecture Memorial Service for the dead In front of the statue of Captain Sakuma Yamura village, Mikata county, Fukui Prefecture, At the grave of Captain Sakuma Kure Submarine School of Navy Roku (6)-go jinja shrine Memorial Service for the dead Takeshi-san, aren't you Takeshi-san? I am Takeshi, but you are...? Did you forget me? I am Fumie. Oh, you are Fumi-san. Excuse me. You look so different. To my memory Fumie-san was small crying girl. O, I must tell oba-san (his mother). Oba-san, Takeshi-san back. Welcome back sir. Mother. Welcome back. This is for you. Good. Welcome back. You look great. Greet you father. Oji-san, submarine is keeping underwater. Must be good for summer. Get cool. Do you think so? That's a big misunderstanding. In order to stay underwater, everywhere must be sealed. The inside is very small. In addition, engines and motors emit heat. Even doing nothing, a lot of sweat coming down. That's too hard. Yes, it is tough. The people on the land cannot imagine the hardships of soldiers who are working in submarine. Only the men, who are patient, brave and loyal to the nation like Japanese, can be the good crews of submarine. Then Japanese submarine is the strongest in the world. Of course. Look the crews of the 6th submarine, who had full of Yamato (Japanese) spirit, be united together, sacrificed themselves to keep their own duty work. Do you understand? Yes. I see. I will be a crew of submarine when I'm grown up. You know, submarine does not like snotty nose boy. ♪ When I go out, always jumping ♪ ♪ and follows me again and again ♪ ♪ Pochi (dog's name), ♪ ♪ you are so cute. ♪ Good, good. Your beard hurts me. Excuse me sir. Aren't you captain Katagiri? Yes, I am Katagiri. Excuse me sir. I am Yoshie, an elder sister of Iizuka, who is a trainee of submarine school. Trainee Iizuka? When Katagiri-sama was serving warship Hyuga as commander, my brother Iizuka was working under you sir. Oh, you are sister of private Iizuka Toru. Thank you very much for caring my brother then. I heard of you a lot sir. No, he took care of me. Something urgent business for Iizuka? If I can meet Toru I'd like to, but before that I have something to ask you about him sir. so I visited here from my hometown far away. So you have something to tell me. I visited your house and was told that you visited here. I have been waiting here sir. So what's the matter? Katagiri-sama might know that, our father died in the disaster at Sasebo offshore in Taisho 13 (1924) he was the master sergeant Iizuka, a crew of 43rd submarine. Yes, I know about that. After father dead, soon mother became sick and dead also. My brother and I were left alone. As elder sister, I considered Toru's future. I concluded that he must follow father's step to become a crew of submarine. I believe it is the best way to devote the deceased father. I see. Father died with regret on duty. but if Toru will serve the nation by following his father, the deceased father must be glad under the grave. That's what I thought. Fortunately Toru completed sailor course and entered the submarine school as a trainee as he wished. I cried with joy. However, sir, I got a letter from Toru suddenly, in which he told me that he did not want to be a crew of submarine. What? He doesn't want to be a crew of submarine? He didn't say so clearly. He said vaguely, like that not satisfied with submarine crew or wants to go other way if possible, he wrote like that in a long letter. Strange. Why? Whatever the reason is, I can't stand his weakness that changed his mind in this stage, I feel my heart is going to break. If he began scared because his father was dead like that, I am afraid that, he lost his nerve after the real experience of submarine. If that is true, hand me Toru to me. Then I am going to die with him for excuse to you sir. I understand your determination. But I believe that Iizuka does not hate submarine for such reason. He is brave man. Anyway, I will see Iizuka immediately. If possible, I will get a permission from the commander and talk in three of us. Thank you very much sir. Iizuka, talk to your sister well. Toru. Toru, you coward, You are... You are... Don't be excited. I will ask Iizuka. Iizuka, what determination made you enter the submarine school? Your father was a hero of the 43rd submarine. Didn't you enter this school in order to follow your deceased father's will? Yes sir, I entered this school with the determination to follow father's will to dedicate the nation. If you understand, why did you give me such letter? You coward. You began to cling to your life. Sister, that's too much. I am son of my father. I never want to save my life. I have no such idea as coward. Then, why did you start to say you don't want to be submarine crew? Tell me why? Iizuka, I don't understand that. This is in front of sacred Rokugo shrine. Speak out your true mind. Commander, well, no captain, I'm sorry sir. To tell you the truth, I have a doubt about being a submarine crew. Doubt? What is it? Then, I want to ask you sir. Is there any chance for submarine to fight the enemy? Will we have an exciting time to fight against enemy by launching torpedo? Sure, we will. That's why we are training night and day. When the time will come? When? I can't promise when. That's what I am not satisfied with sir. Meanwhile the landing force and air corps are working vigorously at this moment, fighting for the nation. Considering that, I am frustrating to do training everyday in peace. I am tired of submarine in which we are simply engaged in training. I see. Now I understand you. Iizuka, it means you want an exciting battle, do you? For example, one-to-one combat by airplane? Or tank by which you can control by yourself against enemy? Yes sir. I do. By that I want to dedicate my life for nation. I believe that is the will of my deceased father. No! Are you saying I am wrong sir? No. Your idea is right in a way. But Iizuka, you don't understand the mission and duty of submarine. That is, you don't get a belief for submarine yet. You have said that the submarine crews were engaged in training alone. No one think of that in submarine. To the crews of submarine there is no difference between war time and peace time. Everyday is endless wary. With the firm belief, we are quietly protecting the sea with full force. It should be a reason that the marine nation Japan was never underrated by foreigners in the history. For example, your father. Your father was not killed by enemy's bullet, that's true. However, he performed his duty perfectly, and sacrificed himself for the protection of our sea. It is not only your father, but a number of valuable lives were sacrificed before we see the current submarine. The closest examples is, there, the 6th submarine. The submarine in which Captain Sakuma died a martyr to his duty. We must step on the heap on the dead one after another for the progress. You told me you wanted to follow your father's will. You must think again the best way how to follow your father's will. Remember? To the dead of the 43rd submarine, the touching remarks was graciously given by the Prince Regent. You are one of surviving family. You must remember it. Recite it now. Yes sir. All the men have fulfilled their duties as loyal soldiers and calmly accepted own death, that made me deeply moved. Say again. Yes sir. All the men have fulfilled their duties as soldiers and calmly accepted own death. that made me deeply moved. Once more. Yes sir. All the men have fulfilled their duties as loyal soldiers and calmly accepted own death, that made me deeply moved. Iizuka, did you understand? Yes sir. Understood sir. Captain, I understand very well sir. Iizuka, crushing in glorious fight is not the only way of hero. Performing one's duty with strong sense of responsibility and great sense of sacrifice, that is real hero. Iisuka, surely the time we can exert our power will come. Very soon it will come. Yes sir. Sister, I was wrong. I'm sorry for causing you concern. Forgive me. Toru. Sister. What's the matter? Sudden visit. I have urgent business. Wait a moment. Katagiri-san, this gentleman waited you for long. Here is no special food, but stay a night. Yes, I intended to do so. By the way, congratulation. For what? I heard you became captain. You are promoted sooner than me. No. You too. You have fulfilled your dream. I am pleased to hear that. Do you have a concrete idea of design? Yes I have. I want to show you the design for your opinion. I came here to get your opinion. Oh, you made it. Actually, the company opposed my idea in several parts, but I persuaded them. Tell me frankly about your opinion. Let me see. This is tonnage. Water-surface speed is this. Cruising power is this. This is... Cruising power is this? Submerged speed is this. Armament is this. And this one is... Listen Katagiri, For living space, I thought hard about it. As a whole, every function is balanced very well. I believe I made an ideal submarine. What's the matter? Hidaka, is this design was made with your full talent and knowledge? Of course. I have completely devoted myself to this design. All the people in the company agreed with this? No, the opinions are divided. But my belief is not changed. A man insisted to increase the the speed to this. Another man, this. A man said the armament should be this level. Someone said the living space must be improved. Someone said we must increase the focus on underwater navigation. If I am demanded to increase the speed alone, I can do so of course. But it demands to sacrifice the armament and others badly. If I increase the armament it will also demand a great sacrifice for others. As you know, unlike surface-water boat, a submarine cannot satisfy such overwhelming demands all at a time. It is impossible absolutely. No. Under the tactics, I demand the highest armament and speed, both of them. Katagiri, you are a crew of submarine. Don't be unreasonable. If you value armament and speed more than ever, what happens on living and submerge? From a view of common sense or theory, it is unreasonable. Then, Hidaka, your design is an assortment of common sense and theories? If you leave the common sense and theory, it is an illusion. OK. Then I ask you. No, I ask your common sense and theory. what do you think about the recent achievement by the naval aircraft? Against the 40 something meter typhoon, a battalion crossed the China Sea in dark. Could it be done with your common sense? And remember the petty officer Kashimura? He could have reached the base with single winged airplane. Can you explain it with your common sense? The passionate devotion can transcend the common sense and theory. Of course I admit the greatness of the passionate devotion. But in current theory 10 plus 10 is 20, which cannot be 30. Fool! What did you say in front of the grave of Captain Sakuma? You promised that you would created the finest submarine in the world for easing his soul. And now you say 10 plus 10 is 20? What is 10 times 10? What is the square of 10? I have such spirit too. But current science would refuse your illusion definitely. Fool! Hidaka, Are you going to be satisfied with average? For what Captain Sakuma had sacrificed his life? The Captain sacrificed himself to compensate the shortage of the science and technology with his spirit. (Taishi-ichiban) A man died once. Hidaka, taishi-ichiban. Do again. Hidaka! A man died once. Taishi-ichiban. Hidaka, do again Your design is an assortment of common sense and theories? What did you say in front of the grave of Captain Sakuma? You promised that you would created the finest submarine in the world for easing his soul. The passionate devotion can transcend the common sense and theory. Shinsaku, study hard. But take care of yourself as well. I will go for ocean navigation. I will be back with heavy suntan. Be well. Send a telegraph, to Kure city Hiroshima prefecture, c/o Submarine School, Katagiri Takeshi. Text; You defeated me. Yes, that's it; You defeated me. Taishi-ichiban. I will do it. from Shinsaku. Navy Department Submarine No. 1 Production Specification Hidaka-san, Yes. This part, with this, we can't work. That's correct. I will go to the work place. Father, when will you come back? When? Maybe this time will take long. You must listen mother. I will complete a wonderful model of motor boat before you come back. See Eiji? Kazu-chan, When father comes back you must bring me pipe and tobacco. Captain Katagiri visiting sir. Oji-chan, hello. I pray for your achievement sir. Thank you. As you know, I was appointed as commander of submarine squadron for exercises which is performed along the south coast of Honshu. I will be in salt wind for a while. I will come with you to the wharf. Thank you. Father, bye! Father, bye! Itterasshai (Good-bye)! Congratulation. As of 10th, you are appointed as captain for the submarine No. 1. I heard that this submarine was designed by your best friend. Yes sir. He is Hidaka Shinsaku. He made this after hard work. Do your best for your best friend too. Thank you sir. Katagiri, congratulation. Brother, good news! What? I got a call from Takeshi-san. Takeshi-san was appointed as captain of the submarine which you designed. What? Katagiri is? Is it true? He said it is scheduled test operation tomorrow. Brother, you are glad, aren't you? Sure I am. Nothing happier than this. Like a dream. Listen Fumie, I and Katagiri, when were children, promised hand by hand in front of the grave of Captain Sakuma. That, I will make the finest submarine, he will be the finest captain. and make it run. The dream comes true now. I can't say how I am happy... Captain, I came to escort you sir. Iizuka, you are now a man of submarine crew. That is, a glory first battle. Prepare a battle and perform your duty. Yes sir. Hatchway OK. I hope Katagiri is doing well now. I worry. Don't worry brother. We will get a news of big success soon. Still, I worry. Give the location of mother ship. Gather all immediately. On the ko-deck. Gathered all. Good. Captain, all 38 men gathered sir. Now, we completed all the processes of exercises of the submarine No. 1. With all of your united powers of crews we could have done successfully and achieved an excellent result. As I captain, I am very satisfied with you. And appreciate you all as well. Now this boat is running the coast of Shin- minato, Yamaguchi prefecture Needless to say, this is the place where Captain Sakuma was dead on duty in 1910. On April 15th The 6th submarine which was commanded by Captain Sakuma, got and accident and died all. Therefore, this boat will now respect the souls of Captain Sakuma and his 13 men. we perform the Manning the Rail. Submarine Number 1 END
