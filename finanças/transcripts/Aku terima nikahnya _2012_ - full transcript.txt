I'm the one who's feeling nervous. -Peace be upon you. -And unto you peace. Let's begin the ceremony. -Johan bin Mansur. -Yes. I announce Nurul Arlisa binti Aziz as your wife with a dowry of RM1,000 cash. I accept Nurul Arlisa binti Aziz as my wife with a dowry of RM1,000 cash. -Valid? -Valid. Praise be to God. -Amen. -Amen. Then, it'll work. What are you doing? I'm looking at pictures of you. I'm already here in front of your eyes. Why are you still looking at my pictures? It's so hot. Dear. Dear, let's go home. You said we'd be here only for a while. It has been hours. You lied. Dear, we need to be patient when fishing. It's just for a while. I can't wait any longer. Look, I got a sunburn. Let's go home. Let's start the engine. -Let's go. -Just a while more, please. It's so hot. -There are lots of fish. -Where? -It's a big fish. -You got a fish? -There are catfishes, eeltail catfish, -Now we can go home! sea bass, catfishes... Dear! Don't jump on a boat next time. It's dangerous. What if you drown? I can't stand losing you. Why are you laughing? I pray that we will always stay like this. Four, five, six, seven, eight. DIVORCE Did you have to put that word? -Dear, it's just a game. So what? -Don't play with that word, will you? I don't like it. Change it. My cute and sweet wife. Listen to what I have to say. You will be my wife forever. -Forever? -Forever. Until we're old? -You don't want to? -Okay, until we're old. Can you please calm down? I told you to go to the hospital near our house, but you refused. You want a big hospital. Why? Could you please shut up? Stop nagging! I'm in pain. What if you give birth in the car? What will you name the baby? Inspira, Viva or Myvi? I don't want all that! Dear! -Mansur, Rohaya. -Mother. -Father. Mother. -How's Johan? Arlisa. Please be patient. The doctor said, if God wills, Johan still has a chance. It's just that if he falls into a coma, it'll take longer for him to recover. Oh, my God. Arlisa. Dear. I'm here. You have to be strong. You have to. You promised you'll never leave me. You promised. ONE MONTH LATER Arlisa. Stop being like this. Arlisa. I'm your best friend. I understand how you feel right now. Since Johan went into a coma, I noticed that you've become... a quiet person. I'm afraid of losing Johan. I can't imagine my life without him. Allah. Allah. Be patient, Arlisa. Ms. Arlisa, Mr. Johan has woke up. Thank God. Your dad promised. -He promised to buy you a new car. -Father. -Arlisa. -Mother. Dear. Thank God. Thank God, you woke up. I really missed you. Do you want to eat or drink? Dear. Who are you? Dear, it's me, Arlisa. Your wife. Mom. Dear. Mother. It's me, Arlisa. Mother, what's going on? Dear. -Dear, I'm Arlisa. -Mom. Dear. The injury on Mr. Johan's head has caused swelling and bleeding in his brain. The injury has caused a problem to his memory. But doctor, he remembers his parents. He doesn't remember me. Ms. Arlisa. The condition he's experiencing right now is called selective amnesia. From my conversation with him, I noticed that the last thing he remembers is his 31st birthday party. His 31st birthday? He hasn't met Arlisa yet at that time. I don't understand any of this. Let's assume that our brain is like a CD. When the CD has scratches, it won't play well. That is Mr. Johan's condition right now. Doctor, does he have a chance to recover? Give him some time. Father, Mother. I would like to ask for your permission to bring Johan home. Arlisa. Why are you asking for permission? You have the rights. He's your husband, you can bring him home. The doctor said that Johan can be discharged tomorrow. Have you told him? I don't know how to tell him. He doesn't even know who I am. I'm afraid that he'll refuse to follow me home. That's why I'm asking for your help. You don't have to worry about that. I'll talk to him about that. There's only one thing we would like to ask of you. You have to be strong to face this test. You have to accept it willingly and keep praying to Allah. For only He knows what's best for us. It's nice, isn't it? You built this house two months before we got married. Do you want to know why you chose this place? Because... Because of the fresh air, the view... The most important thing is you want only the two of us to live here so that no one can disturb us. Let's go. It's okay. Maybe you'll remember once we're inside. Let's go. Come on in. Dear, have a rest. You must be tired. Let me cook your favorite dish. Dear. You must be tired, have a rest. Have a rest, okay. Dear. What are you doing there? Come here. Look what I've cooked for you. Hurry up. I cooked this for you. Sit here. I made your favourite lempeng and sambal. Wait. Take your medicine after you eat. How did you know that I like to eat lempeng with sambal? Dear. I'm your wife, dear. Eat up. It won't taste good once it gets cold. Eat it while it's hot. It's good, isn't it? How is it? Can I have some? Feed me. There. Dip it. It's delicious. I'm really good at cooking, aren't I? Have some more. Dear, why haven't you taken your bath yet? Where's the guest room? Arlisa, are you okay? I'm okay. How are you and Johan? Johan? He doesn't remember anything yet. Not even a thing. He even treated me like a stranger. Babe, I got information from a doctor. You have to try to trigger his memories of you. Try bringing him to places you two used to go. Maybe the place where he proposed to you. Then wear something that he loves to see you wearing. Maybe he will recover. I don't know, Suriya. The doctor told me the same thing. I don't know. I'm scared. I'm scared that he can't accept all these things that I do. With his condition like that. I'm sure Johan will recover. Yes, he will recover. He must recover, Suriya. Let's have a drink. Your dad will be back any minute. -Speaking of him, there he is. -Peace be upon you. -And unto you peace. -Where's Arlisa? I don't know. I can't remember anything. But I feel weird. I feel weird when I'm with her and I feel like she's a stranger. Oh my God. Johan. Please be patient. Give her some time. You've only been home for a week. If God wills, everything will get back to normal soon. Mom, I feel uncomfortable. I don't feel comfortable living under the same roof with her and it feels like... unmarried cohabitation. -Oh my God. -Oh my God. Johan. You're legally married to her. She belongs to you and she's your rightful wife. Have you forgotten what you've said and heard when you accepted her as your wife? Listen to me. Once you have accepted her as your wife, she has become your responsibility. You're responsible for her sins, her happiness and her needs. She's your wife. She is your responsibility from Allah. A gift from God. Mom. Dear, what would you like to eat? Why don't you order the food for me? That's what you usually do. I'll eat anything you order. I don't know what you want to have. I'm going to the toilet. Don't look at me like that, dear. You have beautiful eyes. We're here to eat, let's order. Where are you going? Dear. No, we haven't ordered yet. Hi, dear. I don't know how to start because... Because I feel very embarrassed and very... nervous. In my heart, what I want is to be able to see you every day when I wake up from sleep. That's when I feel my life has become perfect. No matter how many women that are out there, my eyes will only search for you. Will you become my wife until the end of my life? This is my special dish for you. If we can feel what we feel, we will surely feel what we really feel. What is it? Love. Have you ordered? No. If you want to know, -you used to order a special dish here. -Do you want to eat or not? If you don't want to eat, let's go home. Okay, let's... Dear? Johan. -Just a little. -Where have you been? I'm always here. I've been home for a month. Are you going to the gym or what? That was then. You have a friend with you. Who's this? Old friend. Is she your girlfriend or... Hey, have you met Azim and Latif? I haven't seen them for quite a while. I met them and told them about organizing a reunion. If that's the case, organize the reunion, call me, set the date, time and let's hang out. -Okay? All right. -Okay, bro. No problem, I'll call you. -Where are you heading to? -I'm meeting a client upstairs. Be careful with the red shirt. Hey. What I'm hoping for tonight is all about you. What I want right now is for your peacefulness. What I'm asking for right now is you. Where is it? Where are you? I'm already at your house, but I don't even see your car. My goodness, Suriya. I'm still at the office. I have to see Mr. David. So do you want me to wait for you or what? Yes. Just wait for me there, I'll be home in a minute, okay? All right. Don't be too late. Who are you? It's me, Suriya. You're Arlisa's friend, right? We met before at the hospital. She's not home. She told me to wait for her here. Have a seat while waiting then. Be careful, it's slippery. Right? Look here. -Is that all you've got? -That's all I can do. Okay, look here. That looks long. I'm going to lose. I'll surely lose. You're smart. Does the lempeng taste that good? Try it. No, it's the best. Scrabble. -Who is winning? -Johan, obviously. I'm not that good. Johan is very good at Scrabble. Right, Arlisa? Yes. Have some. My turn, right? I'll give you a chance. How are you and Johan? Are there any improvements since that day? He still hasn't remembered anything. You don't have to worry. Johan and I are just fine. I will never give up to help him recover his memories. But how long, Arlisa? It has been a month. There are still no improvements. Are you sure that the both of you are okay? Did Johan provide you with your needs? Mom. -I have my own money. -What I mean is, your needs as a wife. Arlisa. A wife is promised with Heaven when she obeys her husband. But you have to remember. As a wife, you also have your rights. If the husband doesn't fulfill his responsibility towards his wife, the wife can ask for a divorce. Mom. What are you talking about? No matter what happens, I'll never leave Johan. I'll take my leave first. Arlisa. A wife is promised with Heaven when she obeys her husband. But you have to remember. As a wife, you also have your rights. If the husband doesn't fulfill his responsibility towards his wife, the wife can ask for a divorce. Excuse me, miss. May I ask you something? If I pay you in cash, can I get a discount? If you give me a discount, I'll buy more. Yes. You're cute. Seriously, I'm an architect. My clients are looking for furniture and I think this place is perfect. I'm an interior designer. Slightly above your expectation. Are you free today? Can I meet you? Dear, do you remember? This is where we first met. I was arranging some stuff on this table. You thought I worked here. You asked me a lot of questions. Like asking for a discount. You said you wanted to buy a lot of furniture. You didn't give me a chance to speak. Do you remember? Then I said that you were cute. And you said I was cute too. Do you remember? You do. Thank God. Dear. Let's pray together. Dear. Hey, Johan. What's up? This evening? Okay, I'll see you this evening. Where's Arlisa? At home, maybe. She's not joining us? You won't jog with me if she's not with us? That's not what I mean. I just... Johan, let's go home. I'm already tired. Let's just go home, okay? Johan! Dear, where are you going? -I'm going out. -Dear. Suriya called me just now. She told me you have... You have remembered about the accident. Yes, why? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you tell Suriya about it first? Do I have to? Is it important? Do you have to? Important? Dear. I'm your wife. I should know and I have the right to know everything that has to do with you. Dear. Are you not going to eat? I made them for you. Satisfied? And one more thing, please stop calling me "dear." Dad. I know I shouldn't ask you this. But I'm confused. What are your views and opinions if I let Arlisa go? Johan. A divorce is the last thing allowed in Islam for a married couple who is facing a problem. Those who don't have any compatibility anymore. The Prophet once said, "One thing that is allowed, but detested by Allah is divorce." But that doesn't mean that I don't allow it. I just want you to think carefully before making a decision. Listen to what I have to say. Our heart changes. So does our mind. Sometimes, even an angry person can calm down. The blind can sometimes see what we don't. The person that we hate the most can also become the person we love the most. Think about it. Let's go for lunch. Don't worry, it's my treat this time. What do you say? Arlisa, what's wrong? Arlisa. Arlisa, don't treat me like this. Arlisa. I know. This is because I went for a jog with Johan the other day, right? Arlisa. Don't misunderstand. I really thought that you were with him. Trust me. I'm really stressed, Suriya. I don't blame you. Arlisa. I wouldn't do such things to you. I understand how you feel. Arlisa. I have an idea for you. Don't make a sad face. You won't look cute anymore. Smile for me. -Peace be upon you. -And unto you peace. What are you drawing? Nothing. Hey, I just want to talk to you for a minute, okay? Okay, I plan to take you on a holiday. I want to take you to a special place. Before you say no, can you think about it first? The two of us? Yes, the two of us. I've booked everything. Including the flight tickets and our resort. Everything. I feel like I've been here before. You have been here before. Back then. With whom? For what? You came here with me. This is our special place. It's nice, isn't it? It's such a hot day. It's nice, isn't it? Hey, do you want to fish? There are sea bass, groupers and catfishes. All sorts of fish. Let's fish, okay? Don't lie to me. How do you know there's barramundi here? That's what you told me, back then. Help! Help! Help! BEGINNING You're very good at playing with words. But you were better with words back then. I really missed you. I'm sorry. I'm not ready yet. What's wrong, Arlisa? You keep on daydreaming. Have you not settled your problem? It's nothing, Mom. I'm okay. Everything's okay. Arlisa. I'm your mom, Arlisa. I'm the one who gave birth to you and raised you. I know you're suffering. I can feel what you're feeling right now. You're not happy with Johan, right? Mom. I've tried all sorts of things. I give up, Mom. I don't know what else to do. I know. Be patient. Johan. Why didn't you tell me that Arlisa is your wife? But she's not really my wife, okay? What's the difference? I can see that you don't like her and you're ignoring her. You act like she's invisible. Of course, I'm ignoring her because I don't remember who she is. Okay, I admit that I went out with Suriya. Why? Because I feel comfortable with her. She doesn't force me to remember who I am. If you ask for my advice as a friend, I think it's better if you let Arlisa go. That's a brilliant idea. True, it's hard for me to accept her, but as what everyone told me, she's my responsibility. So you understand what it means to let go. Do you not have any feelings towards her? You know what I mean. If I had any feelings for her, you wouldn't ask me that question, right? Yes, it's hard for me to accept her because the situation is the reason that made me like this. Did you think I wanted this? I'm getting a headache. But... I think the best way is for you to let Arlisa go because you can't torture her like this. I'm not the one torturing her. It's the situation that is torturing her and me. Understand? I don't understand. Why did you ask me to come here? A decision has to be made. Decision? How long do you want to live like this? Waiting for me without any explanation. Johan. Johan. A marriage is our life-and-death agreement. Between you and me. Between us. You might have forgotten. But I remember everything. Every single word. The promises you made to me. I remember them. That's why, I'll wait for you. No matter how long I have to wait for you to recover, I'll always wait for you. Why are you willing to live like this even though you know that you're suffering? Why? Because you're the first and the last man for me. You're my shield, my friend. You're everything to me. And... And you, dear, you're my heaven. Sorry for disturbing you so late. I just wanted to give you this. Is Arlisa home? I couldn't reach her. How is she? Come on in. Actually, I have something to tell you. Johan? -Where is it? -There, on the table. -This one? -Yes. Do want me to call for a doctor? Suriya! -What is this? -Arlisa. -What is this? -Let me explain, okay? Get out. Get out! Get out of my house. -Get out! -Arlisa. What? Get out! Suriya. Suriya! What are you doing? Why did you chase her out? You're defending her? Stop all this nonsense. Don't get it wrong, don't misunderstand. Any woman in the world will misunderstand. -Could you please... -What? What else do you want me to do? I've done everything for you. From the first day you lost your memory until today. I've tried to win your attention. I've tried. But you treat me as if I don't exist. Could you please shut up? I will shut up. I'm tired. I'm really tired, dear. Forgive me. For not being able to be the perfect wife for you. Please let me go. Finally. You finally give up. I have never given up. It's just that you have never fought. How do you know that I have never fought? Dear. I accept Nurul Arlisa binti Aziz -I've lost. -as my wife with a dowry of RM1,000 cash. I'm lost in your love. I'm no longer able to create a story for the both of us. Please forgive me for all my sins, Allah. Provide me with patience. Bestow me with the willingness to accept. Protect my heart and soul. Allah. I'm weak without your guidance. I'm blind without your guidance. I'm flawed without your revelation. Allah. Allah, give me strength. Allah. Please give me courage to go through all of Your tests. Amen. Dear. Dear. Dear, I'm here. Dear. Dear. Do you want lempeng and sambal? Dear. -Dear. -I accept... Dear! Nurul Arlisa. You will be my wife forever. I accept Nurul Arlisa binti Aziz as my wife with a dowry of RM1,000 cash. Hi, dear. I don't know how to start because... Because I feel very embarrassed and very... nervous. In my heart, what I want is to be able to see you every day when I wake up from sleep. That's when I feel my life has become perfect. No matter how many women that are out there, my eyes will only search for you. Will you become my wife until the end of my life? Even though there are a lot of women out there, my eyes will only search for you. I'm sorry. For being too late to realize things that I should have earlier. I didn't want this to happen, but the situation made us like this. I need you, Arlisa. If we can feel what we feel, we will surely... We will surely feel what we really feel. In the name of Allah, I accept you as my wife. Nurul Arlisa binti Aziz. Sometimes, the person who loves you the most is the person who never states her love for you. Because she's afraid that you'll turn away and leave. But when she's out of your sight, you'll realize that she's the one you love without you realizing it. Subtitle translation by Pooiyee
