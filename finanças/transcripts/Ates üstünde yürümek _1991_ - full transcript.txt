It's enough for today. We'll gon on tomorrow. How are you? I hope you're not tired? Tired? Not at all. I feel great. I wish this would go on forever. How do you feel? I don't know, you make me feel excited... Give me a second, will you? I'm so unhappy... Why don't you say anything? I'm sorry. Is that all? You can't leave me... Please don't... You can't leave me... - There's nothing left. We're separated. - No we aren't. Don't make it worse... We're separated... ...separated... Please. Hi... - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning, how are you? - Fine, and you... I'm fine too. Ladies. - You naughty. Good morning. Here comes the tea. His timing is excellent. Give me a cup of tea, will you? I've got a few things to say, call everyone on stage. Fellows, fellows... please... you're all wanted on the stage. That's why i wanted to talk you. We don't have much time. The war and the celebration scenes are good. Compared to what? Comrared to "the bad" ofcourse. We shouldn't complain we'll have to do with "the bad". Some of the scenes are falling apart. The "Chaos" scene will do. I think that is the only part we are good at. Intelligence, consciousness, effort and a delicate perception of esthetics are not required for that. Yes, you're right. Anyway... We can't handle the transition to democracy. That's only natural anyway. Do you think i can handle you? - You fool! We're terrific in some scenes. And horrible in others. How do you explain that? Especially when considering the fact that the director, the crew and the dancers are the same. We've fully grasped the idea of war, the victory and the beggnnings of the new wpoch. But we haven't quite delved into... the times of turmoil and the coup d'etat... ...it's effects upon the society and the indiividual relationships. This incongruity effects the pereformance in every phase, from esthetics to interpretation. It's too late to discuss these now. All these should have been explained in the first place. In, till the year 2000... and you should have been allowed to coprehend until the year 2000. You're being ridiculous. - Stop this nonsense. - We've discussed everything for ten days before the rehearsals. We only discussed. What about a unanimous interpretation? What interpretation? - It's getting absurd. Go ahead, tear him apart. It'll be more democratic. Fellows please let's keep it quiet! We should to one another. Hey, folks. - We should respect each other. Artist. Hey Mr. Director, if there's something wrong, you're responsible for that! Let's put the person responsible for this on trial. A dialogue of the deaf... No one listens to the other. Oh! Common sense. Oh! Wisdom. Oh! Tolerance. Wait a minute, the show's not on yet... pull yourselves together. It's enough... enough... It's obvisous why we're not successful in certain scenes. Everyone to their places. Rehearsal's to begin. Are the children ready? The chorus? Let's sing, children... The day's dawning in our eyes. Dark nights are over. A new life will begin. The sun will be warmer the flowers will blossom. Hear ye! Hear ye! And from now on hat will replace the "fes" contemporary attires will be worn. Keep on beating the drums. Children, chorus, on the stage. Yes keep singing... and you, admirers of Europe, quit the dance and... ...join the ones on the stage. All of you. Quick. Don't be passive be active. You'll too join the songs in a hile. Hurry! The peasants, the people, workers try to apprehend what't going on, then, join them... ...the chorus will be leading... yes... No belly-dancing. Try to grasp that exaltation... try to sing well. You're happy. The future's full of hope. A new epoch's beginning. Now it's nice to live Life is more meaningful Sun is brighter Let your hair Loose with the wind, Let the river flow free. Let white foams of water embrace thee Unite your hands in fraternity. With passion, emotion and love, Let's breathe liberty... Life goes on... up, up, up, push and step on him you must go high up up, up, up... What's going on? Life goes on. My i sit here? The table is practically empty. Please... It's very kind of you, thanks. We want food. He's in love with me... ...and he thinks i'm in love with you... ...that's why he is becoming a problem. Are you in love with me? I don't know. I keep thinking of you... all the time. It's wonderful... yes... damn it... it's wonderful... I feel the same... It's wonderful. I think so, too. The economical situation must be improved at once... World war has collapsed the world economy. We're not the only sufferers. You're right. But we must find a solution. As the rulers of this country, the responsibility lies on us. The only way is to increase taxation. But we can't lay a burden upon the weak shoulders of the nation. I f you know a better way just say it... You're silent... We'll collect the tithe. They'll resist. We'll send the gandarme then. Salute! Salute! You're to give a quarter of your crop. We obey the orders of the government, but we can hardly make the ends meet. Orders are orders. The whole nation's in great suffering. You'd better shape-up gentlemen. Democracy. Suppression. Declaration. This is bolshevism. Do you know what you want? We must put an and to the dictatorship of a single political party. We'll split. I announce the slogan of our party. The final word belongs to people. This very day marks the opening of a new page in our nation's history. The fate of our nation will change. My fellow citizens, today is the day we'll rear up, on the saddle of our horse, to happy days of honesty and bravery. This is the and of the sovereignty of a single party and a single leader. What's up? You all seem shattered with that earth- shaking clamour. Never thought of loosing i guess. The nation has given us the duty ofbeing the opposition party. On the 2nd anniversary of the Patriotic Front, thousands keep on enlisting from all around the country. Today, thousands of university students gathered at the Kizilay Square for demonstration. We want liberty. How could this be done? Could one kill a brother with a shot gun? Damned dictators, you cannot inherit the world! We're suffering in pain. Why are you crying child? Can't you see? First we worshipped, then applauded those who tortured our idols. Now we're mourning for them. First we worshipped. Then, applauded the torturing. Now we're crying over it. We've all had blood in our hands. A dance to elevate life can't be performed anymore. No. There's always been a dance for. The faith in life... You must believe in that. What must i believe in? Death, betrayal, love? Considering what we've achieved so. Far everything seems gloomy. Life, love, hatred, lie, truth, joy, passion, revenge, belief, renounciation. To kill by anging, by tearing into. Pieves, by hating each other, by. Suffocating love. What shall i believe in, then? Shall i believe in vulgarity, lack of tolerance, fanaticism or hypocrisy? Life, suffering, hatred, lie, truth, joy, passion, revenge, belief, renounciation. What would you do if you were to express them in a dance? And love must survive. How would you do that? The ones in black, you're the enemy of liberties. You must suppress them at all costs. Ant you, you're trying to figure out wat's going on... But you're not able to. Coup d'etat has been declared on March 12, at 03 am. All our nation and our security forces. I think it's great. How's it going? Just as i've expected. They say it's wonderful. Do you believe everything you hear? You're too modest. You look happy. I hope you haven't messed it up this time. Goodnight. See you. - Goodnight. Come here, here's our director, the unique artist who staged the production. Is that so! Yes, something must be done. Hi, everything's great, isn't it? Yes, so it seems. May i have a word with you both. By all means. Please, you're drunk. Let's talk tomorrow. No, we'll talk now. Do you know how much i love her? And that we're lived together for three years. You're drunk... Let's talk tomorrow. And what we shared was a time of extreme ectacy. Good for you. Then there was you. Not exactly. Don't interrupt me. Leave us alone. I f you weren't around we might recapture days of happiness. You should discuss it with her. There's nothing to discuss. Our relationship was long over. It't not over, you're in love with me, and so am i. We've already discussed these, and agreed to separate. We made a mistake. I've heard enough of these. I'll kill you... and him too... I am not bluffing, do you understand? Leave me alone. Let her go. Come with me. How could you speak ofkilling or dying so easily? I cannot live without her. As you're in love with her, are you trying to say that she too should either love you or die. I'll tell you, she was happy with me. Then, she's not happy anymore, if she were, she wouldn't look for another affair. She's not in love with you. She admires you that's all. We're ready to fall in love. There's an image we nourish in our minds. Someday we meet someone. A word, a simple gesture brings it all out. What really matters for a love... ...affair to be saved is to let all associating emotions overcome one's self. You're talking in riddles. I love her and you keep telling me all these. I can not live without her. If she leaves me i'll kill her... myself... and you... Spectators... contented... and watching as usual. Good, the show's going well. I really admire your optimism. Despite everythign, i have faith in future. Which scene are they performing now? Tne years ago. What did they perform before this scene? Yes another ten years ago. What shall we perform in a while? The next ten years to come. The spectators are contented. And you detest everything. Yes, i detest everything. The show's going on well. It's not a bad performance. The spectators are contented. You detest everything. I have faith in future. I think you must kill your gril friend who left you. The consistency must be preserved. I pushed you too far, aren't i? I am sorry. Yesterday. Again, you were. Shouting how much you loved her, do you remember? I love her, i will kill her. I love her, i will destroy her. I love her, i will tear her apart. I sometimes understand you and sometimes don't That's the reason for my tense behaviour. You might say that you have been living in a smoke covered husstle for a long time. So what would you expevt it to be? Yes, but i still cannot accept it. I cannot accept living with love, violence and pain all together.
