Is there any truth to that rumor? (people chattering) - Gentlemen, we have a prepared statement, if you'll just be patient. (people chattering) (cameras clicking) - Okay guys, let's go. (people chattering) (cameras clicking) Stand by to move out. (people chattering) (gulls cawing) (people chattering) (children cheer) (children laughing) (children laughing) (children chattering) - Nick. You promised. - Look, I'm sorry. Something very big has come up. I'll talk to you about it later on. (gulls cawing) (children laughing) (children chattering) (thunder booming) (gulls caw) (thunder rolls) (suspenseful music) - It's time to move you in the house. (suspenseful music) (thunder cracks) (rain falling) - Mummy? - Hm? - You know that clown? - Mhm. - Well, how could he make it thunder? - I don't know. Magic. - Could you hire him to come again next year? - We'll see, huh? Now, why don't you go in the bathroom, and don't forget to clean your teeth, and I might let you watch television later on. (clock ticking) (thunder rolling) - [News Reporter] The chance of finding Eli Steel alive. However, rescue and search teams will continue to comb the coastline throughout the night. With Governor Connors still ill in hospital, the question being asked who will now deputize for him? Senator Nick Rast was non-committal when he flew in from the capital this afternoon. - [Alex] Mummy? - [News Reporter] When asked whether he was a likely replacement for Eli Steel... - Mummy! (dramatic music) - [Sandra] Oh god. Oh, it's okay. (dramatic music) (dog barking) (whistling) - Heel now. (thunder rolling) Dr. Lovelock. (rain falling) - That won't help him. Nothing will, it's too late. (clock ticking) - And there's no point in shifting him. - Then that's it? - Well, Sandra, as I have explained, the drugs we use in treating leukemia, they damage the memory cells as well as other normal cells in the body, as evidenced by the loss of hair and bleeding tissues. - You're just giving up? - Sandra, it comes to a point when the treatment does more harm than good. I mean, he's had three long years of this. I think he's just lost his fight. - It isn't the fighting that's killing him, it's the giving up. - Yes, well I appreciate your spirit, Sandra, but I can't authorize any further treatments. Now wouldn't it be easier if he just-- - I'm not interested in making anything easier for anyone. - For God sake's, Sandra. Everything humanly possible has been done. Hm? (rain falling) - Filling him with radiation, you fill him with drugs that hurt, that turn his blood to water. He's only a little boy. And then you just stuff him, you just give up. - Sandra, please. - Oh, what have you done? Except run off to your little whore. Just, just go away. Leave us alone. (slow, melancholy music) - Um, sorry about that, doctor. This may sound a bit callous, but it couldn't possibly have come at a worse time. I have to be back at the capital in the morning. (slow, melancholy music) (clock ticking) (wings fluttering) (bird chirps) (slow, dramatic music) (wings fluttering) - Nick? Nick. Nick? (slow, strange music) What is it? (thunder crashes) (dramatic music) (slow, strange music) - Who the hell are you? - You don't know? - How did you get in, what do you want? - Gregory Wolfe. I've come to help Alex. (dramatic music) We are a cheerful lot, aren't we? - I didn't send for anybody. Who let you in? Did Bergier let you in? (dramatic music) Bergier? Robinson? (dramatic music) - Nick. (dramatic music) Can you help him? - Alex? Alex? (dramatic music) Do you know who I am? (dramatic music) - Can you help him? - It's already done. - Oh, this is absurd, preposterous. - My son's dying. - He's not even sick. - [Sandra] He's dying. - Get up, Alex! - He can't get up! - Come on, Alex, of course you can. Come on. Up, up, up, up. - [Sandra] Stop it! - Do you want to die? To rot? (dramatic music) (soft orchestral music) You all right? (cuckoo clock chiming) - [Alex] Mummy? - Where'd he go? - Can I ask Alice to make me a sandwich? - You all right? Who is he? - This is for you. (balloon pops) (chuckles) (keys typing) - I don't know. He just appeared, did something to Alex, and then vanished. Our security didn't pick him up, and neither did the dogs. I haven't been able to find any trace of him. - Sandra. Would it make any difference if I told you I've buried people who have been cured by characters like that? - No. - Then why are we wasting each other's time? - Look at him. It's been a week and he grows stronger every day. - Sandra, as I explained from the beginning, the heartbreaking thing is the periods of spontaneous remission. Oh, it's quite common. The patient feels much better, but it's only temporary. It's always temporary. - Mummy, can I watch TV? - Mhm. Off you go. Why won't you authorize an examination? - If Alex is happy, and if you and Nick would just take each day as it comes, why should I expose him to a long, uncomfortable series of tests just to prove what we've known for many months? If Alex thinks he's cured, let him enjoy it while he can. (bird chirps) (suspenseful music) - [Alex] If I put my finger in here, will it come out the same? Oh, it's not working. How does it, how does it happen to go that way when I put the two fingers there? - Who are you talking to, darling? - Gregory. - What are you doing here? - Didn't you send for me? - How did you get in? - He came in through the television. - You can't always believe what you see, Alex. (strange, dramatic music) - Who are you? What did you do to Alex? The doctors have given up on him. - Have you given up on him? (strange, dramatic music) - They say his recovery is only temporary. Spontaneous remission. Every day when Alex wakes up, and keeps breathing until bed time has been an eternity. For the last week I didn't dare hope for more. But look at him. It's like... A miracle. Isn't it? Did you cure my son? - Alex is as well as he feels, and it will last as long as he wants it to. (Gregory whistling) - I'd like to know how you got in the other night. Alex tells me you turned into a bird. - You said you wouldn't tell. - You must have climbed the ivy. Where are you from? - [Gregory] Overseas. - Which sea? (Gregory speaking French) You speak French? I've always wanted Alex to have a second language. It broadens the outlook. - Ah! Voila. (Sandra chuckles) - Aren't you ever serious? (blows) Would you do something for me? - For you, mon petit chou, I would cause kings to fall and cats to fly. (buzzing) - [Nick] If things, if things can be done and there's a-- - Lucas. Certainly. Nick? It's for you. - Thank you. That that, that's what it should be, that is where the emphasis of our time will be put. Yes? Senator Rast. - I found him. He's coming for dinner tonight. - Sandra, I do wish you wouldn't do these things without-- (line cuts off) (typing) - [Gregory] What about you senator? What do you believe in? - Nicky believes in votes. - Are you interested in politics, Wolfe? - He's absolutely seduced by politics. It's his only passion, I fear. Oh, I'm sorry. Two drinks and I completely lose control. Isn't that right, pet? - Hello. Gregory, you can stay overnight. We've got tons of rooms. - What an interesting idea, Alex. - He should be in bed. - [Alex] Aww. - Go on, off you go. - Will you show me how you make the dogs bark again? - [Sandra] Go to bed darling. - All right. Good night, Gregory. Good night, mum. - Alex? Next time I'll turn them into swans, and we'll soar on their backs among the clouds, how about that? - Terrific. Good night. - You seem to have won a devotee. - Tell me something, senator. How does a deputy governor manage to vanish in broad daylight? - Heavy seas. - But in 90% of drownings, the body turns up. - Really? - Hm. 90% of ordinary drownings. But in the case of Eli Steel, the whole area was crawling with helicopters, rescue vessels, even divers, within minutes of his disappearance. And yet, nothing. - Well how do you think it happened? - I know nothing about politics, senator. But I do know about magic. And I know there are powers at work in the universe. To those higher powers, the de-materialization of a given target would be child's play. - Well, perhaps Eli Steel was spirited away by a UFO. - Why not? It's as credible as drowning. - I'll mention it to our chief of security. - Anyone for strip poker? - Then you don't believe it's possible for a person to slip in and out of this dimension? - I'm simply saying that there are more plausible explanations. - Then you think it was assassination? - Are you kidding? - No. (strange, dramatic music) - Benny? It's Nick. Just as a matter of interest, has the computer thrown up anything more on the Eli Steel drowning? Yes, I know it's late, but can you check? (solution bubbling) (scrubbing) - Alice? Where's Alex? - In the lounge room. Excuse me, mum? Will Senator Rast be in tonight? - No. - Will Mr. Gregory? - I'll be making dinner this evening. You won't be required. - Thank you, mum. (scrubbing) - Alex? (clock chimes) Alex? (cat meows) (dramatic music) Alex? Alex? - Rawr! (squealing) - Oh, Alexander Rast, don't you ever do that to me again. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to shout at you. Has Gregory been teaching you tricks again? - Watch. Voila. - Oh, voila you. - Can I go to the beach with Gregory this afternoon? - No. - Aww. - Oh, you're with poor Gregory day and night. He may have other things to do. Besides, you're going to the movies this evening with Mr. Bergier and Mr. Robinson. - Please, mum, please? - Definitely not. (waves crashing) (gulls cawing) - What do you see, Alex? - The ocean? - What else? - Birds, the clouds. - What else? - Kinda... - Yes? - Kinda like the edge. - Bravo. The edge of the world. Where the earth is at war with the sea. Now listen, what can you hear? - The wind? (gulls cawing) - The wind. Our invisible friend. See? How it holds the gulls aloft? Is that not magic, Alex? Now, Alex. (dramatic music) What do you feel? - I, I'm not scared. - Use your heart, not your head. What do you feel? - Wolfe? - There is the edge. Only the wind separates you from the rocks. What do you feel? (dramatic music) - Death. - Again! - I feel death. (dramatic music) - Death sits here, perched like a vulture waiting for you to forget it. Death... Always remember the feel of death, Alex. And he'll never be able to take you by surprise. (gulls cawing) (slow, dramatic music) - Wait a minute, Nick. The boss likes you. He said to me, "Doc, I like that guy. "But if I don't get out of the hospital soon, "we're gonna be up the creek." You know what that makes you, senator. - Yes, a paddle. - That's right. Now the press has been playing you like a violin. My man doesn't like it. - Look, I haven't been briefed, Doc. I need facts and I need figures, not just rhetoric. - Well I always say the defective government consists of ignoring facts. - Well I'm not sure I'm cut out for all of this. - Oh sure you are. We put you in the computer and the computer said you'll do. - Okay. - Oh, and another thing, senator. Lay off the Steel drowning. Ask questions about the anti inflation plans, the price of oil in Texas. But don't as questions about things you know nothing about. That's why we've got intelligence. Oh, and incidentally, senator, about your new image. Intelligence said cool it with Zoe Cayce. - Oh now wait a minute Doc. - Look, your wife is hot stuff. The chief executive said to me, "Nick's wife is hot stuff." What the hell do you want with a tramp like Zoe Cayce? - Well it's a long story. - Nick. You know how Portis boys operate. Now job Zoe Cayce or they'll drop her for ya. - Excellent. - Thank you. I am on to you, Gregory Wolfe. - Mhm? - I think I know who you are, and what you want. - Oh? - To Alex, you're his playmate and mentor, so you assume that role. To Nicky, you're an itch he can't scratch. To Bergier, a security risk. To Alice, the mysterious guest. You're different things to different people and you play each role separately. The thundering faith healer, the political, innocent. The parlor magician. (laughing) - And what am I to you? - I think you push people into the deep end. That's the beginning and end of your purpose. You force people to escape their limitations. Take Nick, his limitations. - Take Sandra. Her limitations. - Oh, no. I'm not going to let you change the subject. - Why do you and Nick have separate bedrooms? Don't you ever sleep together? - No. Our marriage was arranged by people in high places. It was politically expedient at the time for Senator Rast to marry the daughter of an ambassador. - Ah. Money. - I'm not so much a wife as a PR job. - And Alex? (sighs) - Another political expediency conceived out of a committee decision. When we found Alex was leukemic, I thought we were finally reaping the marred fruit of a godless union. Does this sound like a confession? I'm sorry. - So by curing Alex, I have absolved your sin, is that it? - Solved one. Induced another. You're pushing me into the deep end, too. Aren't you? (soft, strange music) I arranged this evening. Must I do everything? - The deep end is always with you. All you have to do is fall. (soft, strange music) - Where's your glass? (soft, romantic music) (soft, strange music) Get out. (sobbing) Get out! Get out! (plate shatters) Get out! (plate shatters) Get out! (yelps) Please. Get out. (soft, dramatic music) Gregory? Forgive me. (soft, dramatic music) (sobbing) Please. Forgive me. - Forgive me. - I do love you. - I know. (soft, dramatic music) (soft orchestral music) - Sandra? - Nick? - How was the garden party? - Fine. When did you get back? - Oh, about noon. Sandra, I would like a word with you. - I'm tired. - Yes, yes I'll bet you are. - I think I'll go to bed. Good night. - Where have you been? - You're drunk. - Yes, I'm drunk. - How nice for you. - Alex was wondering where you were at bed time. - No he didn't. And don't use him like that. - The garden party finished at five. - Then we're obviously late. - You two have been spending a lot of time together. - It was your idea that he take me to the garden party. - Doc Wheelan thinks it would be a good idea if we didn't see quite so much of Gregory. - And if Doc Wheelan told you to jump into a pile of crap, you wouldn't stop to put your boots on. - Governors rise and fall on Doc Wheelan's say so. And the word is, I am to replace Eli Steel. - Whoopee, Nicky. - And this deputy governor is not gonna share his house with that live-in lay about. (soft, strange music) (strange, dramatic music) Are you sleeping with him? - Why the sudden interest in me? Isn't your little whore from the typing parole, what's her name? Zorro. - Zoe. And she's a press assistant. As a matter of fact, I've stopped seeing her. I thought it would be best to give more time to you and Alex. - We don't want your time, Nick. We've managed just fine until now. And now that Alex doesn't require every ounce of my love and every minute of my time, I'll do as I please as late as I please, regardless of what you, Wheelan, or God all mighty thinks. Do we understand each other, senator? (gulls cawing) (thunder rolling) (gulls cawing) - [Alex] Oh. I'm not, Mr. Robinson? - Too cold. - But I wanna show Gregory something. - Well you'll just have to show him in here. (gulls cawing) (thunder rolling) (Alex humming) (Alex and Gregory humming) (gulls cawing) (dog whimpering) (slow, dramatic music) (dog whimpering) (shrill music) (horn honking) (thunder crashes) (gulls cawing) (upbeat music) (radio chatter) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Well yes, I'm sure he'll be here, it's just that I wish people would wouldn't keep calling him "Our Gregory." - Because he's our Gregory, pet. Everyone should have their very own Gregory. - Would you excuse me just a minute? Our guest of honor. Edith, lovely to see you again. Dr. Barthelemy. How was your flight? - Awful. - We nearly didn't come. Miss Twist has a very bad tooth, but she insisted. - And where's this faith healer of yours? - He's probably putting Alex to bed. They're very close. (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Oh for Christ's sake. You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, that's what the chief executive told me. (upbeat music) (people chattering) - I think that maybe you have come here to find out if everything they say about this Wolfe is true. - Could be. - Ah, interesting, interesting. How do you determine whether a healer is genuine or otherwise? - If he's genuine, I'll know. - Allow me. (upbeat music) (people chattering) (people chattering) (fanfare music) - Miss Twist. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. (shrill, strange music) (knocking) - Come in. - Oh. What is this monkey business? (laughing) Now, listen carefully, because I have a riddle. What has 100 legs, has three sharp nails, and comes down the chimney every Christmas Eve, yeah? - Hm. Santa Claus? - Aye aye aye aye aye. A wise guy already and not even 10. What more can I teach him? (clock ticking) I'll be leaving soon. Got eggs to hatch and cats to cure. Can't hang around here forever with a dumb kid. (slow, soft music) - Why do you have to go, Gregory? - Angels live forever, Alex. Falling stars spend all their power at once. Burn out. - Why do you have to die? (soft orchestral music) - Because that's the way it always happens. Because I think the time has come. (soft orchestral music) - This year's total, $327,449 and 97 cents! (applause) (cheering) (people chattering) - Gregory, darling. Come and let me show you off. (soft chattering) - You should have worn your gorilla suit. - Under the circumstances, something rather loud. - Miss Edith Twist, may I present, Gregory Wolfe. - So, we meet at last. - And you've met Benny Lucas. And Dr. Barthelemy. (upbeat swing music) (people chattering) (upbeat swing music) - Mr. Wolfe. I'm told you hold great influence over the Rast family. - We do think he's rather special. - Yes, yes, if I were younger, I'd feel the same way. - You're wanted in the kitchen. - [Dr. Barthelemy] I'm told you're something of a healer. - I make no claims, doctor. - Well then you deny you cured Alex Rast? - I deny nothing. (Alice sobbing) - What is it? What's wrong? - I am asking. - Why do you ask what you already know? - I want to hear the truth, here and now. Did you cure Nick's son? - The truth is, he's cured. - Then you claim you healed him? - Well you heard him. He said he performs miracles. - Well go on. Perform a miracle for us. - What sort of miracle would you like to see, Benny? Shall I make frogs rain from the ceiling? Or shall I turn lead into gold? No? Perhaps something more sophisticated, more spectacular. Perhaps I shall make a grown man vanish at sea. - I was in my room, and I was taking a bath. And Mr. Wolfe, well, he came in while I was in the tub, and, and he looked at me. His eyes. You know what they're like. It was like I was paralyzed or something. And, and, he... (sobbing) - Alice. Why are you telling this ridiculous story? - Mrs. Rast, do you know of any reason why Alice would lie? - He's an engaging man. And Alice, I imagine, like most girls her age, fantasizes-- - Mrs. Rast. I don't think you fully understand. Alice alleges that Wolfe raped her. (Alice sobbing) - Well the doctor says you're a phony. Give me an answer. (laughing) (wings flapping) (guests gasping) - Senator Rast, I'm afraid your magician friend is becoming a bit of a bore. - I agree with him. - Why are you frightened, doctor? It's only a magic show. Right, Mr. Wolfe? - Only magic, indeed, Miss Twist. (guests exclaim) (clapping) - Oh. - Stunts, and illusions. (guests gasp) (dramatic piano music) (crashing) (clapping) Puffer, and deception. Flim flam... (wings flapping) And hocus pocus. (guests exclaim) (dramatic music) (hitting) (guests yell) (dramatic music) (guests chattering) - Mr. Wolfe. Is it true you healed Alex Rast? - Ask the child's mother. - It's quite true, Miss Twist. - Then, surely, you will do an old lady the kindness to cure an abscessed tooth? - As her doctor, I say no. - Can you? Yes, or no? - Just like power, pain is an illusion. - No, I will not allow it. - Why are you lying to me, Edith? There's no abcess. Your knowledge of medicine appears as fraudulent as your healing powers. Shame on you, Edith. Upsetting people and causing such a bother. (tsking) How does poor old Dr. Barthelemy put up with all this mischief? - This is absurd. I see what you're doing, Wolfe, but you can't dismiss an abcess as psychosomatic. It's there; I've seen the x-rays. - The pain isn't even in her mouth; it's in her neck. Look. (upbeat swing music) - Oh! (water running) (sniffling) (upbeat swing music) - The pain is orange. I feel orange, good. But if it should suddenly turn black, we'll have to stop, is that clear? (Edith grunts) I'm working it down your neck. Good. (upbeat swing music) Good. Still quite orange. Fine. Fine, that's it. There. Look here, Edith. Didn't you feel it? - Yes. - How does it feel? - Orange. - Good. (water splashing) (slow, strange music) Now the elbow is a bit of an obstacle, Edith. Now this won't hurt, but as it passes the joint, it'll cause a little... pop. How's the tooth? - Fine. But my arm hurts. - Good. You see the orange has to be tricked. Or as the doctors might say, we have to isolate the offensive tissue. (slow, dramatic music) Come on. Got ya. Now... Do you know how we isolate the pain, Edith? - No. - Like this. (chopping) (guests exclaim) (dramatic music) (gasping) (Alice yells) - [Sandra] Get off him! - Oh, it's only a little carrot. (dramatic music) (screaming) - Get him out of my house. (dramatic music) (typing) - They just said hold him. Damn federal boys, what am I supposed to do? The book doesn't-- (laughs) Assault of some sort. Girl got acid thrown in the face or something. Hell, I don't know, they just said process him and stick him in the slammer so what am I supposed to do? Damn feds. (dramatic music) (door opens) - [Nick] You all right? - Have they brought him back yet? What'll they do to him? - Oh, nothing. - He didn't harm anyone. - They're just asking a few questions and they'll let him go. - I want him here. Nothing is more important to me than that. I want Gregory back. Now. - You have been sleeping with him, haven't you? - I don't have to answer to lies and rumors spread by little people with little minds. - Oh, you love the rumors. You love having him on your arm, showing him off, dropping the odd little innuendo. - They'll deal with him the way Eli Steel was dealt with, won't they? - Oh, don't be childish. - Then get him back. You're Senator Nick Rast. You get on the telephone and tell them. - It's not that easy, darling. - Get him back. Or Alex and I will leave you. If you haven't the strength to stand up for the man who saved your son's life, then you can go to hell, senator. And you can go alone. (knocking) - Hi, Benny. I'd like a word with Doc. - Sure, Nick. We've been expecting you. - Have a seat. Come about Gregory? Oh come on Nicky. There's absolutely nothing to worry about, just relax, will you? - What did Benny mean you've been expecting me? I'd like to speak to you in private, if I may, Doc. - Nick. After last night, I don't think the Wolfe factor is very confidential to you. - Wolfe factor? - Senator, I think you know Mr. Porter, our chief of security. - Mhm. - Senator, my department's been collecting a file on Wolfe which dates all the way back to Strasbourg, 1971. I'm afraid you won't like what we found. He's a professional, senator. A specialist. We have evidence to show he was brought into the country illegally on a forged passport to do a job. We know for certain that he gained entry to your estate by posing as a party clown at your son's birthday. He was observed giving your son a slice of cake. Our investigations indicate that the slice of cake was laced with adrenocortical steroids. They produce a feeling of well being. Blood and urine samples proved beyond doubt that Wolfe has been giving your son drugs. That would account for the so-called cure. We have affidavits from four independent doctors which I'm afraid show there are still leukemic cells in Alex's bloodstream. - God, why? - Well, someone with influence over the family could be worth quite a lot to certain outside interests. - Well all right, but how did he get access to the estate? - He had an accomplice senator. Like all magicians. I'm afraid your Mr. Robinson has been arrested. - Oh, come on. Robinson. No, that just can't be right. Well, all right, then, but what about Miss Twist's tooth? I mean, surely she must be above reproach, isn't she? - She's undergoing tests. I think we'll discover that the abcess is still there. - No. No, that just can't be right. I mean, I have seen things with my own eyes. Doc's seen them, Benny's seen them. - I'm not saying he's not good, he's the best. A combination of illusion and hypnosis. Nothing that a professional with the right props wouldn't attempt. - That's it's for now, boys, I'll call ya. (door closes) (chuckles) There's no fool like an old fool, is there, Nicky? - Well. I'll submit my resignation to Mr. Connors. - Are you out of your mind? You think we went through all this trouble just for your resignation? We've got too much invested in you. This is the big time, the stability of the government. At 8:30 at night, you're gonna get a phone call. - Connors? - That's right. It'll be the first official proclamation of the death of Eli Steel due to misadventure. And he wants you to take second position. And another thing, Connors only knows what I want him to know. But when he gets out of the hospital, that might open another can peas. That's why Wolfe is poison. - Where is he really? - Wolfe? In jail, illegal entry. - You won't hold him. - I'll hold him. I'll hold him if I have to nail his hands to the wall. - Lunch. Better eat. You may be in here for a while. - I will be out of here before sunset. - Like to make a bet? (laughing) No. Hate to take your money. - [Sandra] Bless and protect him from harm. - Bless and protect him from harm. - Send him safely back to us. - He's not coming back. He said they're going to kill him. - [Sandra] Who's going to kill him? (clock ticking) - Sandra, we have to talk. - Liar. - Sandra, I am not making this up. - Where is he? I want him here. You tell, tell Robinson to get him back this instant. - Look, it's in the file. Robinson's been arrested, apparently-- - You're the big noise nowadays. You get Gregory back. - It's not that easy. - Alex needs him. - Oh, it still has not sunk in has it? Wolfe did not cure Alex. Read the file, there are affidavits. - Affidavits can be fake. - Oh Sandra, for God's sake, read the blasted thing. - How can you say Alex is still leukemic when no doctor will agree to examine him? - It's in the file. Adrenocortical steroids. - No! Now, we had a deal. Either you get Gregory back or Alex and I leave. - You are being totally and absolutely unreasonable. Wolfe is being charged, I can't just walk-- - Don't you see what's happening? You're a puppet. You're an ineffectual in government as you are in bed. You're being used and you're stupid to know it. - You damn well look at this blasted thing. You think you were the only one? What about that? You think that's a fake? You think everything's a fake except your precious Gregory? What about that? Alice? In our own house, Alice, right? Now was that before or after he slept with you? And there's more, look. (birds screeching) (glass shatters) (soft orchestral music) - It's a long drive to the cottage, Mrs. Rast. I don't mind taking you. - Thank you Mr. Bergier, but Alex and I are going to start doing things for ourselves from now on. Besides. He needs you more than we do. (slow, dramatic orchestral music) (birds chirping) (clock ticking) (water running) (wings flapping) (dramatic music) - Bergier? (dramatic music) Bergier? (dramatic music) - Cutting it a little fine, aren't ya? Harry Houdini always used a hair pin. (shrill, dramatic music) (sizzling) Ow! (shrill, dramatic music) (yelling) (wings flapping) (wings flapping) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Wolfe is out. (dramatic music) Who's there? - Just Bergier. - We're on our way. Tell Bergier to let the dogs out. (dramatic music) (dogs barking) (gun cocks) (dramatic music) (dogs barking) (dramatic music) (cat screeches) (dogs barking) (cat screeches) (dogs barking) (cat screeches) (dogs growling) - Get out of it. (dogs growling) (suspenseful music) - Bergier? (suspenseful music) Bergier? Oh, god. (dramatic music) It's moved. Look. (suspenseful music) Wait. (dramatic music) - What the hell? (suspenseful music) - Bergier? Bergier? (dramatic music) - Bergier, give me Wheelan. I know he's not in his office, dammit. Patch me over to his car, and be quick about it. (dramatic music) (insects buzzing) - Bergier? (insects buzzing) Bergier? (dogs growling) (barking) (knocks) - Mr. Rast? (rattling) (knocks) Mr. Rast! (rattling) Hello? Bergier, at the Rast Estate. You'd better get over here on the double. There's something funny happening here. - Come on, man, step on it, move. (sirens blaring) Is there any way for him to get into the house? And keep this line open. Where's Rast right now? (rattling) (suspenseful music) (rattling) (suspenseful music) (shattering) (shattering) (pieces cutting air) (dramatic music) - I can't. I have no way of-- Hang on. I'll call you back. - Wait Bergier, wait. Idiot. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) - [Bergier] It's Bergier. He's in the house. - Who? - [Bergier] Wolfe. - Where? - [Bergier] Behind the door. (suspenseful music) - Wolfe? Wolfe? I know you're there. What are you playing at? (suspenseful music) (clicking) Wolfe? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Gregory laughing) (dogs growling) (barking) (line beeping) (dogs growling) (barking) (gun cocks) (gunshot) (gunshot) Sandra and Alex aren't here. What the hell are you supposed to be anyway? - A harlequin. In old Italian comedy, the harlequin couldn't be seen by other characters. Only by members of the audience. Good evening, Mr. Bergier. - [Nick] We know all about you, Wolfe. What you were doing to our son-- - Mr. Bergier? I have a problem. And I don't really have very much time. Senator Rast thinks I'm trying to trick him, and I'm going to have the devil's own job trying to convince him otherwise. What he doesn't realize, you see, is that at this moment, a magician far more infamous than myself, is lurking on another monitor. - I know it's engaged. This is Doc Wheelan; unengage it. (insects buzzing) - What in the name of God do you want? - I want you to open your eyes and see, that's all I've ever wanted. - See what? - Yourself. I've given you every possible clue and still you're blind. Your only virtue is your weakness. Your accessibility to influence. Why do you think you rate all this security? To keep people like me away so that you hear only one voice. You're being groomed, Nick, by magicians, to serve their purpose. See, for the hour grows short. (dramatic music) - You talk in riddles. - Eli Steel was assassinated, is that clear enough? He was killed to create an opening for you. - If that's true, then why didn't they kill Mr. Connors instead? - Mr. Connors will never leave the hospital; he's dying. He's dying of a disease slowly induced by the administration of a drug. They're doing to him exactly what they accused me of doing to Alex. - And who are these mysterious they? - Use your head. It would have to be a doctor. Someone close enough to Mr. Connors to administer the drug. (dramatic music) - We get in there, I might be able to pick him off with the rifle. - [Doc] Wait. - But-- - I said wait. (dramatic music) - Take the call. Tell Mr. Connors you'll be happy to be deputy governor. With me to advise you. - You? You are evil. And you're a fraud. (hits) (gasps) (grunts) (dramatic music) - Do you think Mr. Porter would like that trick? Or that one? (fire ignites) (dramatic music) (lightening blasts) (dramatic music) - What are you? (dramatic music) (laughing) (suspenseful music) It's nearly time, Nick. Who are you going to believe? Whose magic is stronger? - There were photographs, and-- - Come on Nick. A leader must be able to think clearly, make important decisions. Time to make a decision, Nick. (phone ringing) (clocks chimes) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Don't say anything, Nick. We're right outside. Everything's under control, but you've got to get him into the kitchen. - I see. (coughing) Could you go and get me a glass of water from the kitchen, please? Can hardly swallow. - I see. Then that's it. (dramatic music) - Nick, hang up the phone. Mr. Connors will be trying to get through. We'll take care of Mr. Wolfe. (phone ringing) (dramatic music) - Hello? - [Woman] Senator Nick Rast, please. - This is he. - [Woman] I have Mr. Connors on the line. - [Nick] Who is this? - [Woman] Zoe. - For God's sake, Zoe, why didn't you warn me? - [Zoe] What are you talking about? - Wolfe, you were sleeping with him. - [Zoe] I've never even met him, Nick. - Look, I saw the photographs. - [Zoe] And I'm telling you I've never met him. (dramatic music) Nick? - Gregory! (dramatic music) Gregory, wait. (gunshot) - [Gregory] I wanted to open your eyes. Mr. Rast thinks I'm tricking him. - [Sandra] You're being used. You're a puppet. - [Gregory] Eli Steel was assassinated, is that clear enough? He was killed to create... Mr. Connors will never leave the hospital. He's dying of a disease slowly... - [Doc] But you've got to get him into the kitchen. (dramatic music) Breaking and entering. - For God sake, did you have to kill him? - You're splitting hairs, Nicky. The man is waiting. - Wolfe wasn't a fraud at all, was he? (phone ringing) You manufactured this entire thing. Did you know that Zoe Cayce and Wolfe had never even met? - You'd better talk to Connors. - Yes, I suppose he'll be the next to go, won't he? - I said the man is waiting. (phone ringing) There's a mess in the kitchen. Get Jepson to help you clean it up. (phone ringing) - Get something to wrap him in. (gasps) (dramatic music) - Come on Nick, you're in too deep. - And how are you going to explain that? - Explain what? No corpse is gonna be found and nobody's gonna miss Gregory Wolfe. (man gasps) (dramatic music) - Mr. Connors? Yes, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, sir. (dramatic music) Yes, yes, I understand, sir. (suspenseful music) (insects buzzing) Yes, thank you, sir. (suspenseful music) Yes, I've been expecting it. Thank you sir. I will accept the appointment, yes sir, thank you. Yes. Yes, good bye, sir. - Relax, Nicky, we're on our way. - To hell. - [Doc] You lie down with dogs, you've gotta get fleas. - It stinks. - Power. Power, Nicky, that's the way it always smells. (window shatters) (dramatic music) (gunshots) (dramatic music) Get rid of him. I don't care if you have to bury him, but make sure he stays planted. (dramatic music) - Come on. (dramatic music) - You really think you're gonna get away with this, don't you? - Get away with what? - Cold blooded execution of Gregory Wolfe. - Gregory who? (water spraying) (water splashes) (suspenseful music) (splashing) (dramatic music) (trunk closes) (suspenseful music) (children chattering) - Ooh, I've got something. I've got something, help me! (children chattering) (dramatic music) - [News Reporter] That an autopsy revealed water in Wolfe's lungs, thus establishing the cause of death as drowning. There is to describe a few people who knew him as a miraculous healer, little is in fact known of Gregory Wolfe, who appeared on the scene quite suddenly a few months ago, formed a close relationship with the family of Senator Nick Rast and is rumored to have been ridden the senator's son of a terminal disease. Both the government and the senator have refused to comment on Rast's shock decision to resign from the senate less than 24 hours after his new appointment by Mr. Connors. However, unconfirmed sources have mentioned there have already been several arrests, and that more are expected. Whether these unusual developments are...
