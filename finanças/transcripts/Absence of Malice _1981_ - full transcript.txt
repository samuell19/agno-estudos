[ Teletype machine tapping ] [ Typing on keyboard ] [ Beeping ] [ Projector motor whirring ] [ Man coughs ] Capaletti. - Carlyle. - He's dead since June, boys. The man, Santos Malderone. And here comes our boy, Michael Colin Gallagher. Forty-three here, forty-seven now. Tommy Gallagher's only kid, nephew of Santos Malderone. Occupation: wholesale liquor. Bob, what's this got-- Duck, Waddell! Where were you guys when I needed you? [ Typing ] Hi, Donna. Oh, hi, Meg. Did somebody rob a bank? Wish somebody would. Anything new on Diaz? Oh, sure, lots. We're just not ready to discuss it yet. So where is everybody? No place you care about. They're all up watching the movies. What movies? Surveillance film. Tommy Gallagher's funeral. It's pretty funny. Bob Waddell gets slugged at the end. - Who's Tommy Gallagher? - One of the bad guys. He got dead before you got here. All the crooks showed up, so we took some pictures. - Why don't you ask Bob to let you see it sometime? - Sure. He's still crazy about you, Meg. He's a nice guy. Hey, Donna, I've been here three years. How could he be so interested in a guy that's been dead that long? That stunt got him busted for assault, and that's all we got on Mr. Michael Gallagher. For those of you new in town, his old man, Big Tommy, handled five states worth of liquor, Did a little loan-sharking and kept the longshoremen out of miami for 15 years. He played rough. If he'd been alive when Joey Diaz got hit, he'd have been suspect #1. Since he was dead, he's probably not involved. Big Tommy had a stroke in '67, brought his kid Mike down to run the family store. Word is, Little Mike's clean. I don't buy it. I want to find out. - Meersma, I.R.S. gets his last six years. - Six? Come on! Work it like you were making a net worth case. I want to know every nickel he's got, and how he got it; His mortgage and car payments; and his 2106s, okay? Mac, you guys crawl all over his union stuff. Bob, bureau gets the rest-- friends, neighbors, all the way to the butcher shop. I want to know where he was when Joey Diaz went away. I want this guy to know we're in town, okay? [ All muttering ] Hey, Bob, Eddie. How come the streets aren't safe? Disadvantaged youths. You spent all morning at the movies, huh? What movies? The Gallagher funeral. - Donna said you might show it to me. - What? Donna's on her way out. Wait a minute. Take it easy. She didn't do anything. What are you doin' for lunch? Sorry. I've got a date. [ Woman ] Browsky's under arrest. [ Man ] what for? I sent him to a homicide on south west 8th street. Do you hear 'em yellin' at me? Rosie? Line four. It's the electric company, Mrs. Connolly. Why do they talk in my teeth? It's the only way they can reach you, Mrs. Connolly. [ Man ] Apalachi cola? A-p-a-l-a-c-h-- Sue, there's a story in here on a Michael Gallagher. I'd like a copy of it. Make sure this is on the son, Michael Gallagher, not Tommy. Okay, fine. Thank you. Bob Waddell's office, please. [ Boat horn blowing ] [ Rock, faint ] [ woman laughs ] [ Loud ] [ people chattering ] Hey, Tom. Hi. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. Got hung up on a rewrite. I'm glad you called. What's up? Cathy, a vodka martini, rocks. Look, I just wanted to make sure that Donna didn't get into any trouble. She's got to learn to be more careful. She didn't tell me anything. She just said you guys were looking at the Gallagher film. Yeah. Well, let's forget it, okay? Okay. I'm buying. No, put it on mine. Hey, Meg. How are you? Did you know he has a son? Gallagher. Listen, I called you last night. I thought-- I got in late last night. How'd you know he had a son? I met him once at a party. Oh, you cut your hair. Yeah. It looks terrific. Thanks. - He seemed nice. - Who? Gallagher. Listen, I'm gonna tell you something out of school. You don't want to have anything to do with Mike Gallagher. Not ever. Especially not now. Why not now? You're gonna bust him? He's already been busted. For what? For assaulting a federal officer. You're getting off on gangsters now, Megan? What is the matter with you? Let's talk about somethin' else. Hey, can I buy you dinner? Not tonight. I'm busy. I wanted to make sure you didn't send Donna off to Siberia. That's all, huh? Come on. You'd let me know if you wanted me to quit asking, wouldn't you, Meg? I don't want to be a jerk. You're not a jerk. Mac, I think the strike force is onto something. Must be an accident. What? A guy by the name of Michael Gallagher, son of a bootlegger, Tommy Gallagher. What have they got on him? I don't know, but it must have to do with Diaz because that's all they're working on. What else have you got? Supposedly he sells liquor. He's got a warehouse on the channel. Makes sense. Longshoreman. I ain't got it yet. Can you work Quinn? He wants us to love him. I'm not sure how much he knows. He's the D.A., But Rosen runs the strike force. How 'bout Rosen? [ Groans ] Christ, if he said word one it'd be the first time. [ Sighs ] [ Woman ] Yes, sir? Grace, there's a reporter on her way to see me now. When we come in the office, give me about a minute, then buzz me, all right? Hey, Elliot? Oh, sh-- Michael Gallagher. Terrific. The guy who hit Diaz. Congratulations. You solved the crime of the century. Where'd you hear that? If I revealed my sources, you wouldn't talk to me. That would be terrible. Elliot, the public has a right to know a few things. Where's it say that? There's a sign on my desk. Yeah. Well, it'll be a dull conversation, but come on in. [ Sighs, sniffles ] You want some coffee? No, thank you. Go. What can you tell me about the Gallagher investigation? I can neither confirm nor deny any investigation... Which May or May not be in progress. - Not for attribution. - No confirm, no deny. - Background. - Can't help. - Off the record. Off the record? Yeah. - No comment. - You're a real sweetie. I told you it was gonna be a dull conversation. [ Intercom buzzes ] Yeah? All right. I'll be there in a minute. Well, cheer up. Maybe you'll get lucky. Gotta go to a meeting. Oh, take your time. Have a little coffee. [ Door closes ] "Under investigation." Weak. - Can't we say he's a suspect? - I still don't know what he's suspected of. Suspected in the murder of Joey Diaz. Kidnapped. No murder. There's no body. Presumed murder then. You're missing six months, you're dead. Prime suspect? I don't know he's prime. Maybe they have somebody "prime-er." Key. The key. A key. Christ, you want anybody to read this? You keep watering it down. "Informed sources." Well-informed. Mac, if he wanted to leak the story, why didn't he tell me off the record? Instead of talking out of school, he's got you snooping through government files. Smart guy. "Sources in the federal building"? That sounds like the janitor. Knowledgeable sources. [ Mac ] knowledgeable... Sources. Why did Rosen want it out? Maybe he's trying to be a nice guy. Maybe he wants us to owe him a favor. Maybe he likes your legs. If we try to figure out why people leak stories, we'll publish monthly. - Davidek better read this. - Oh, he's gonna love it. Now, madam, you propose to say that Mr. Michael Colin Gallagher... Is the approximate cause of the demise of the esteemed Mr. Diaz. That's not what it says. It says he is under investigation. Mr. Gallagher will think we make him out a murderer, As will his friends, his neighbors. Let us assume that he is neither a murderer nor the subject of investigation for same. Let us suppose that your story proves to be false on its face. - This story is true. - Madam, if newspapers printed nothing but truth, They need never employ attorneys and I should be out of work, which I am not. - I read the file. - I'm not a whit interested in the facts. I'm concerned with the law, and the question is not whether your story is true. The question is, what protection do we have if it proves to be false? Now then, Mr. Gallagher is not a public official, nor is he likely to become one. Pity. Is he a public figure? He's not going to sue, for god's sake. So what does it take to make him a public figure? If I knew, I should be a judge. They never tell us 'til it's too late. I admit I'd be more comfortable if he were a movie star or a football coach. Football coaches are very safe, indeed. Have we spoken with Mr. Gallagher? - We don't exactly call the mafia for comment. - Please make the attempt. All right. If he talks to us, we'll include his denials, Which will create the appearance of fairness. If he declines to speak, we can hardly be responsible for errors he refuses to correct. - If we fail to reach him, at least we've tried. - What are you telling me? I'm telling you that as a matter of law, the truth of your story is irrelevant. We have no knowledge the story is false; therefore we're absent malice. We've been both reasonable and prudent; therefore we're not negligent. We May say whatever we like about Mr. Gallagher, and he is powerless to do us harm. Democracy is served. Teresa? Yes, Mother? What are you doing? You've been away from the office for an hour. Are you ill? I'm not feeling well, Mother. Shall I send for the nurse? No. No, Mother. I'll be all right. If you're coming down with something, you should go home. - We don't want the whole school infected. - Yes, Mother. And put out that cigarette. Yes, Mother. [ Continues ] [ door closes ] I'm Michael Gallagher. [ Man ] Marcia, line four. What do you want? Where'd this story come from? [ Clears throat ] What can I do for you? I wanna know where this story came from. - I can't tell you that. - Oh, yeah? Who can? Mr. Gallagher, if you want the matter clarified, speak to the government. I already spoke to it. And? It's not talkin'. Mr. Gallagher, were you involved in Joey Diaz's disappearance? No. Can you prove that? I don't have to do that. If you're not involved, why do you think you're being investigated? - I don't know. That's why I'm here. - Have you ever met Mr. Diaz? You write about everybody being investigated? Everybody we find out about. What do you write about when the investigation's over and the guy's innocent? Well, they never tell us when the investigation is over. Mr. Gallagher, to the best of our knowledge, our story is true. Now, we appreciate your coming in to talk to us, But I'm not sure there's anything we can do. We have an obligation to report such things. - You got an obligation to tell the truth? - Of course. If you want to know what's true, how come you don't talk to me before you write what they say? I tried to reach you. There was no answer. You should have called back. I'm around. I don't think this is getting us anywhere. Is there anything else we can do for you? - Are we investigating Mike Gallagher? - We? Yes, we. The justice department, remember? Oh, yeah, sure. Where you worked before you went into politics. Smart. Real smart. That's why they move you so much. You wanna try for Cleveland? It says we're investigating Mike Gallagher. That's true. Says he's a Diaz suspect. Oh, that's not true. - What is he suspected of? - What's the difference? - Stop screwing around. - Just for the record, I run the strike force. - And I run the D.A.'s office. - I tell you anything, it's strictly courtesy. And I want to know what the hell you're doing. [ Intercom buzzes ] No calls. [ Woman ] it's Jerry Peters, committee for a better Miami. Okay. Hi, Jerr. How's the golf? Listen, I tried, but I just can't do both. It's too far. Please tell them, "remarks, no speech." See if I can do cocktails at one, dinner at the other. Thanks, buddy. Joey Diaz was an honest guy. He'd even run a decent local. Some creeps made him disappear, and we got no footprints. Six months, and we're nowhere. We beat our brains out talkin' to people, and we got zip. We're lookin' like dopes. We got $50,000 on the street, and we don't get a postcard. I gotta have help. - So you're squeezing Gallagher. - Hey, you got somebody better? He's Tommy Gallagher's kid. He's Santos Malderone's nephew. His old man dealt booze to every hood from Atlanta to Miami Those guys kept the union out of here for 15 years. He knows those people. He can get to 'em if he wants to. - Is he clean? - Oh, that's not the point. I'm not trying to convict him. I'm trying to get some information. Diaz got dead. Gallagher's just gettin' squeezed a little. I suppose you got him under surveillance too. No. - You think he knows anything? - He can sure as hell find out if he wants to. I'm trying to make him want to. I still don't like it. You worried about the A.C.L.U. Endorsement? You wanna be a cowboy, go to New York. - Think of the credit you'll get if we nail somebody. - Elliot, talk to him first. Give him a chance to cooperate. Then okay, investigate him if you have to, but no harassment. If he goes along and we nail the Diaz people, you might get elected to somethin'. [ Horn blows ] [ Chattering, shouting ] Hey, Mike! Twelve Bacardi Silver and sixteen Bittersweets out to the Lullaby. [ Woman on loudspeaker ] Mike to the office. You got visitors. Mike to the office. The fuzz. - Mike. - Where's your camera? This is Eddie Frost. We'd like to talk to you for a few minutes. Am I under investigation? That's not why we're here, Mike. - Do you know anything about Diaz that might help us out? - Nope. If you do, we'd make some special arrangements. Ha! I don't need any special arrangements. It might be in your best interest to cooperate with us, Mike. We'd go a long way-- Do you know where that story came from? - No. - Call me when you do. Where were you May 25, 1980? - [ Shouting ] You got a warrant? - No. Get the hell out of here. [ Boat horn blows ] Come on. [ Piano, faint ] [ Piano continues ] What are you doing here? I read the paper, Michael. What's goin' on? Ah, nothin'. Don't worry about it. I called the school today. They said you were sick. Oh, no. I was just worried about you, that's all. Come on in. I'll get you somethin' to eat. [ Sighs ] Oh, how's your dad? What did the doctor say? He's fine. He'll outlive us all. Want a beer? No. Michael, tell me what's goin' on. I don't know. Well, is this true? Are they investigating you? I don't know what the hell's goin' on. I went to the paper. What did they say? Ever try to talk to a paper? What are you gonna do? You don't need that. What are you gonna do? [ Sighs ] I don't know yet. Michael. How 'bout some spaghetti? I'll make you some spaghetti. I don't understand. I-- Well, the F.B.I. Came around this afternoon, so something's goin' on. God, what does that mean? What'll they do? Snoop around, talk to people. They might even ask you some questions. Oh, my god. Hey, it's no big deal. Just answer 'em. - Hey, shouldn't we call John and Lena and tell 'em-- - Michael! Don't you remember where we were? When? When that guy, that union guy, went away or got kidnapped or whatever. No. What? We were in Atlanta, Michael. Don't you remember? You brought up the papers. The headlines were all about it. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. What kind of questions are they gonna ask me? Do you know me? How do you know me? Stuff like that. Should I say no? No, no. Don't say no. Of course you know me. Oh, my god, Michael. Hey, come on. Take it easy. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. How do you know me, hmm? How do you know Michael Gallagher, Miss Perrone? I've always known him. He used to take care of me. What's your relationship now? He cooks me spaghetti and he-- he, uh, nags me about my smoking. He's my best friend. The week that... Joey Diaz was reported missing, Did you see Michael Gallagher that week? Will they ask me that? I don't know. Answer it. - Yes. - No. If they ask you that, just say "I don't remember." [ Sighs, inhales ] I don't remember. On May 25, 1980, Uh, did you see Michael Gallagher that day? I don't remember. Where were you on that day? [ Phone ringing ] [ Both speaking spanish ] [ Bell tolling ] [ Woman on loudspeaker ] Mike, line four. Mike, line four. [ Spanish continues ] [ Tolling continues ] Gallagher. Mr. Gallagher, this is Megan Carter from The Standard. I was thinking about what you said. My name is on that story, and if there's anything wrong I'd like to know about it. I would like to hear your side. Don't expect the truth unless you're willing to tell it. Eat lunch? Yes. Pick you up in 20 minutes in front of the building. It's a tan wagon. I'll put a couple of stiffs on the hood. [ Phone ringing ] Mac, where's that little tape recorder you used to have? What do you want with that? Seems I'm going out to lunch with Mr. Gallagher. How'd you manage that? Where's that stick pin with the microphone in it? Wait a minute. You didn't tell him that you were gonna write this? He didn't ask. I'd better send a photographer with you. I can't do this with a photographer sitting on my lap. - He'll stay in the background. Who have we got in the pool? - Walker's available. Walker. Terrific. I want somebody who knows where you are. This may be the guy who hit Diaz. If anything weird starts to happen, he can call me. Are you sure Walker knows what "weird" is? [ Horn honking ] Hi. Pretty day. How long have you got for lunch? As long as I want. Good job. Where are we going, anyway? Boat club. All warmed up and ready to go, Mike. Where are you going? We can eat on the water. Oh. - What's the matter? Are you scared? - Of what? [ Motor running ] How old is this thing, anyway? 1934. Who owns a wood boat anymore? You must spend all your time fixing it up. Does it have a name? Rum Runner. Why Rum Runner? My old man was a bootlegger. [ Motor stops ] How far out are we? Was your father really a bootlegger? Yeah, for a while. He did a lot of things. What else did he do? Was he crooked? Is that what you mean? I guess you'd say he was crooked. Want a beer? Yes, please. - People say he ran Miami. - He just had a lot of friends. Do you? Not the kind you mean. [ Can top pops ] Wife? Yeah, once. A pretty lady, but she was no friend. I thought bootlegging went out with prohibition. My old man was stubborn. He had this import business. Daytime, bananas; after midnight, booze. No tax stamps. Same boats, same crates, same warehouse. It used to work pretty good. Used to? I don't like working nights. When did you get out? I don't mean jail. When did you get out of bootlegging or whatever you call it? I never got into "whatever you call it." Why not? Sounds lucrative. It's against the law. - Aren't you hot in that-- - Oh, no. Thanks a lot. - So you're tellin' me you were never in the business? - That's right. You sorry? Are you? Yeah, sometimes, when business is bad. Then you were tempted. I had no choice. My old man said no. When he said no, it was no. You really look as though you're uncomfortable. This is very lightweight. You have a record. Yeah. Assaulting a federal officer. The F.B.I. came to my old man's funeral. They brought cameras. They came to the church, they came to the cemetery, so I slugged one of 'em. Oh. What? Nothing. - What else you wanna know? - As much as you wanna tell me. - I really do want to be fair about this. - One of those up-front ladies. I try to be. Who's the guy in the volkswagen? And who the hell am I talkin' to? [ Whispers ] Oh, shit. - What do we do now? - Eat. [ Motor idling ] Mm, this is good. What is it? It's a bordeaux. Pontet-latour. - What do you call this? - A salad. [ Puts fork down ] Gallagher, I'm a reporter. What'd you expect? Don't try to make me feel guilty. - You really think I had something to do with Diaz? - It's a distinct possibility. If there's nothing there, why are they picking on you? I gotta know where that story came from. Knowledgeable sources, you said. Who is that? Somebody's trying to get to me. Somebody with no face and no name. You're the gofer. You listen to them, you write what they say, then you help 'em hide. You say you got a right to do that, and I got no right to know who they are. I'm sorry, Gallagher. I can't help you. [ Sighs ] How old are you? Thirty-four. How come you're not married? Maybe I am. How come you don't wear a ring? Ever heard of liberation? - Most of them are ugly. - Was that supposed to be a compliment? - Look, if they clear you, I'll write about that too. - What page? You say somebody's guilty, everybody believes you. You say he's innocent, nobody cares. That's not the paper's fault. People believe whatever they want to believe. Who puts out the paper-- nobody? If you knew I was gonna write about you, why did you do all of this? - I'm a publicity hound. - No, really. I mean, why the boat, the picnic and everything? I didn't want you running out of a restaurant before I got some answers. Did you get any? Not the ones I wanted, but some. [ Helicopter approaching ] [ Man on loudspeaker ] Are you Megan Carter? Are you all right? We better get out of here. I'll catch a cab. Take care of yourself. Yeah. Broke down again? [ Quiet chatter ] [ Man ] I got 22 stories on this one. [ Man speaking spanish ] [ Spanish ] You got no authority here. Those men belong to the longshoreman's union. The union says they don't work. It's your union he's talkin' about. You people know Mike. Make up your own minds. You wanna keep your cards, you don't work here today. We got other work for you, and tomorrow the same. Mike, we have a problem. What's goin' on? Motormouth from the union, one of Diaz's guys. He's trying to shut us down. What's the beef? I know you, Gallagher. I know your sentiments. You don't like us, we don't like you, so now you work without us. - I had nothing to do with Diaz. - That's not what we hear. And we don't work for you. Joseph Diaz was a saint for us. Joey was a loudmouth and a jerk, but there was nothing bad between us. I hope you will be many years in the prison. That goes for you too. I don't want you guys crossing no picket line. Come on. We may have had problems, but it was strictly business. - I had nothing to do with Diaz. - It ain't about Diaz, Mike. They pull our card, we don't work, nowheres. You pick up at Gallaghers, you're handling struck work. Gallagher's is closed. [ Men murmuring ] [ Truck engine starts ] Jesus christ! [ Door opens ] Am I out of work? Close. - What are they going to do? - They ain't workin'. What are we going to do? We're goin' huntin', John. [ Latin jazz ] [ Loud ] [ People chattering ] - The same article as muskie. - He should say it's muskie. Were you all there when contine walked up to me... And pulls out a black book and starts quoting union rules... About how he must get paid time and a half? He keeps going on and on. McAdam is just sitting there. Are you just passing through? It's a nice joint. Free nuts. Oh, John Orrega, Megan Carter. You've heard of her. Hello. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Are you looking for me? Is that the only thing you got on for tonight? You're crazy, man. [ Man ] He's gonna be in there all night. He would lay on that lawn... With all the lights off, so I wouldn't know he was there. He was trying to catch me. One night, I was on my third date. I opened the door to shake hands with Ralph and I turn on the lights. There was my father laying on the front lawn. Spread-eagled, you know? The guy didn't say anything. Are you finished with your dinners? Yes. We just all stared at him, and nobody said anything for a long time. Then Ralph said, "Good night, Mr. Carter." And I said, "Good night, Dad," And I just shut the door and locked him out. [ Laughing ] Oh. Um. [ Chuckles ] Your friend John doesn't like me very much. He's kind of scratchy today. The longshoremen struck us. I didn't know those guys could read. Is your old man still-- Yeah, he's still around. Does he work? Oh, yes. He's an investment banker. My old man did that too. - You're kidding. - Only it was called "loan-sharking." Oh. There must be a difference... 'Cause my old man did time for it. Oh, mine just hasn't been caught yet. Let's see, I was 15 when they sent him up, And during this little extended vacation, A couple of kids and me stole a car, went joyriding. And when he got out, he found out about it. He took me in the woods to a cabin. It had a dirt basement. He locked me in and left. Three days. Who was he to preach? He wasn't preaching. He said if I wanted to be a thief, then I oughta know what the life was like. Huh. This guy Quinn, this D.A. What's he like? Oh. What? I see. What? [ Sighs ] You're hustling me, and you aren't even hustling me. I don't know what you're talkin' about. Look, Gallagher. I'm very sorry you got struck, but it's not my fault, And I will not tell you where that story came from. It's the truth, and that's enough. Okay, quiet down. "Quiet down"? Is that the only way you like your women-- nice and quiet? Hmm? Are you getting a little crocked? You want me to? What I want-- I'm not hustling. Oh. Uh, I just need you to get to know me fast. Okay? Okay. Waiter? Check. Oh, no, no, no. I'll pay. Unless you think that would make you impotent. You got some mouth. [ Man ] We'll be there about 8:00. Where's your car? Back at the pen and pencil. Okay. You're gonna follow me? Uh, not tonight. You said you wanted me to know you, fast. You're not interested. - I'd like to think it was my idea. - I'd like that too. Gallagher, I'm 34 years old. I don't need courting. I'm from the stone age. I guess I do. I'll send you a dozen roses. I can save you guys a lot of time. Tell Santos I'll meet him Tomorrow at the ball game. The light's green. [ People cheering, applauding ] He's gonna steal. He's gonna steal. How are you, Uncle Santos? [ Man ] All right, here we go. [ Child ] come on! You look good, Michael. You too. Everybody asks for you. They want to know how you are. How are you? I'm okay. I've been better. What have you got guys following me for? [ All cheering ] I told you he was gonna steal! Wake up! Tony, don't fall asleep on me out there, please. I don't like to read about you in the newspapers. I'm not crazy about it myself. Is somebody setting me up? [ Chuckles ] What are ya talkin'? Maybe somebody you know. You got a lot of friends. What are ya talkin'? You're my nephew. [ Laughs ] You're family. You're looking in the wrong place. [ Man ] That away to pitch! [ Cheering, applauding ] You know what I think? It's downtown. They ain't got nobody for Diaz. They're in trouble. They're embarrassed. Maybe they think you'll help 'em if they push you hard enough. You know a lot of people. That's why your guys are following me? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna help 'em? - It's not my business. - They can make you think it's your business. Don't sell 'em short. They got ways. Nope. Good. Good. Good. A lot you remind me of Tommy. You're all right. Thanks. Buona fortuna, Sonny. Be well. Take good care. I'm Teresa Perrone. I guess you know I'm Megan Carter. Thank you for meeting me like this. Sure. Would you like a cigarette? No, I'm trying to quit. Michael hates it. I have a story for ya. Michael Gallagher is innocent. You were with him the night they got Diaz. You'll swear to it in court. I'm used to dealing with girlfriends. Why do you think I'm a girlfriend? Just a hunch. No, I've never been Michael's girlfriend. I've known him since childhood. We're friends. Of course you think he's innocent. No, I know he's innocent. How? [ Children shouting ] Well, because I was with him... At the time. But you-- I don't want you to say it was me. I see. Where were you? I can't tell you that. How do you remember this? It was ten months ago. Do you remember where you were the day Kennedy was shot? Can you prove it? I don't know. Miss Perrone, uh, you're very loyal, if that's what it is. But I can't write a story that says someone claims to know Michael Gallagher is innocent... And won't say how or why or even give her name. I am assistant to the principal at San Ignacio school, And the publicity would be-- I just can't. Suit yourself. But you printed that other story. - That was different. I knew where it came from. - You don't believe me? I've never met you before in my life. You want me to write that Gallagher is innocent, then you tell me I can't use your name. You say you were with him, and you won't tell me where. What would you do? If I told you-- just you-- Would it have to be in the paper? Probably. Why? If it has nothing to do with Diaz. I mean, it's private. I'll speak to my editors about it, but I can't promise you anything. But I don't understand. Couldn't you say you spoke to someone who was with him? I'm a reporter. You're talking to a newspaper right now. Do you understand? You said you could keep it out. I did not say that. I said I would discuss it with my editors. Look, if you have some information... About where Michael Gallagher was that night... And you want to help him-- You don't understand. Th-there was this guy. Michael hates him. Maybe he's not so hot, But, uh, you see, I'm catholic. [ Sighs ] Miss Perrone. I don't want to be rude, but I don't understand what you're trying to tell me. I do have a deadline. I have to get back to the paper. I had an abortion. I got pregnant, and I didn't know what to do. I-I got a name in Atlanta, And Michael took me. It was, uh, three days. He stayed with me every day, every hour, and that's what happened. That's not such a terrible thing. Have you told anybody else this? Oh, god. Oh, you're not catholic. It's 1981. People will understand. Are you crazy? Not my people. Not my father. I don't even understand it. How old are you? You believe me, don't you? Yes, I do. Then don't write this. You're a friend of Michael Gallagher's. He's in trouble. You've told the truth about something that will help him. No one's gonna hate you for that, really. Really. Do you have any ticket stubs or receipts... That would prove that what you're-- [ Talking, faint ] Eight-and-a-half cases short, and he drops us after twelve years. I could redo it the other way, so we'd lead with that. That's fine. Mac, if it has no bearing on the case, then why run it? What does it mean? Let the readers decide what it means. I'm beginning to feel funny about mentioning the abortion. Isn't being with Gallagher what's relevant? What difference does it make-- The only reason I believe the story is because of the abortion. Don't tell me it's not relevant. Are you sure you're right? I'm never sure I'm right. She's the alibi witness for a key suspect in a major crime. People have a right to know the alibi. You got something going on with Gallagher? Good night, Mac. [ No audio ] Mac, about this construction worker-- Meg, we've had-- um, uh, there's-- there's been an accident. What? It's Teresa Perrone. What happened? She killed herself. They found her about an hour ago. Where? Her father woke up and found her. She was living at home. Did she leave a note? They don't think so. - Meg? - You want me to do the story? No. No, no, I'm gonna do it. Okay. You wanna go home? No. [ Typing ] [ Typing stops ] How? She... Cut her wrists with a razor blade. Turns out she was seeing a psychiatrist. Look. People get caught up in things. Remember the woman in San Francisco a few years ago... Took a shot at Ford? The guy in the crowd grabbed her arm and saved the president's life... And was a hero. Turned out he was also gay. That's news, right? Now the whole country knows that too. Did he kill himself? Meg, let me take you home. It was not your fault. Why do I have to go home? Michael? You don't wanna come in here. I'm warning ya. If I could just talk to you-- Shut up! I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna hear any of it. What the hell are you doing here? Details? Is that what you want? Okay. They found her naked in the tub. She didn't even want to make a mess. No water. Just naked in the tub. You interested in that? You interested in how she felt? Yes-- Okay, she picks up a newspaper, for christ's sake, And there it is for everybody to see, everybody to look at. She must've felt like-- [ groans ] Aaah! Don't, Michael! Raped! Goddamn it. She must've felt-- Michael! [ Screaming ] Stop it! [ Whimpering, quiets ] You know, something I didn't know-- When you kill yourself it's a homicide, so they do an autopsy. [ Sighs ] They're gonna get a knife. [ Groans ] They start here. They're gonna split her open. When they get up here they use shears. They use shears, for christ's-- Oh, goddamn you! Get away from me. [ Weeping ] Excuse me, Michael, but I can't go home like this. I need something to wear. I'll have this returned to you. Couldn't you see what it was to her? Couldn't you... Stop scribbling for a second and just... Put down your goddamn ballpoint pen... And just see her? Didn't you like her? [ Continues weeping ] It was Rosen. It was Elliot Rosen. Runs the strike force. He's the one that leaked the story about you. I don't know why. [ Sobbing ] I have to go now, Michael. I'm very tired. [ Continues weeping ] - Were they in Atlanta? - I got him on the manifest, but it doesn't mean he's clear. Doesn't mean anything. Either he did it, or he knows who did it, or he can find out who did it. Well, he sure isn't easy. Yeah. Why don't you see if Meersma's got anything from I.R.S. You think we oughta let this cool down? No. I'm sorry about Perrone. I got a job to do. This thing isn't just gonna go away. I still gotta find who hit Diaz. That's what they're paying me for. The hour has come for the son of man to be glorified. I solemnly assure you, Unless the grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, It remains just a grain of wheat. But if it dies, it produces much fruit. The man who loves his life loses it, While the man who hates his life in this world... Preserves it through life eternal. Grant her eternal rest, o lord, And may your light shine on her forever. Amen. [ Intercom beeps ] [ Man on intercom ] Who is it? Michael Gallagher. I need to see my uncle. Yes, Michael? I got a job to do, uncle. I need some information about this guy Elliot Rosen. Uh, this is Michael Gallagher. I'm somewhere else right now. If you wait for the tone, leave your name and number, I'll get back. [ Sarah ] How large is the search area? [ Typing ] Can you give me the boundaries? Are there sharks in that area, do you think? Okay, great. Thanks, Lieutenant. No, I think I'll be working. Maybe lunch. Bye-bye. I don't think they're gonna find those guys. It's been two days now. You might wanna go easy on the sharks. Why? Don't scare the tourists. The rule is, it's a shark if it walks out of the water, stops traffic and bites a cop. If they're just swimming around, we call 'em fish. Okay. Fish-infested waters. Want some coffee? Might keep me up. It's decaffeinated. Been thinking it might be time for you to come on the desk. I'm not over the hill yet. I think you'd make a damn fine editor. Mac... You ever miss being on the street? Nope. Too many people out there. A lot of news is bad news for somebody. You stay out there too long, the "somebodys" start adding up. You ever think about doing anything else? Yep. But you won't. Nope. Mondays are always different from Tuesdays. You don't have to lie a lot. Once in a while you nail the bad guy. I know how to print what's true... And I know how not to hurt people. I don't know how to do both at the same time, and neither do you. Maybe you're tougher than I am. Yep. That medicaid arraignment is tomorrow. Yeah? You want art? You betcha. I think they oughta get their pictures in the paper. I want you to think about the editing. You're a good newspaperwoman, Meg. And if you delete "newspaper"? I like you all right. Your meeting, your agenda. I want a deal. What you got in mind? Whatever I find out, you get. After that, you're on your own. But none of this federal witness stuff. I wanna stay in town, I don't wanna testify... And I don't wanna deal with anybody except you. - Why with me? - Maybe I don't trust this guy-- what's his name? Rosen? What do we do for you? The investigation you guys are running on me is over now. I want you to make a statement clearing me, and I want it in the papers. What do you think you can come up with? [ Chuckles ] Well, whatever it is, it's more than you got. We don't make statements clearing people. We don't talk about an investigation until somebody's been indicted. Well, someone sure as hell talked about this one. This guy Waddell, does he go with that newspaper lady? The one that wrote about me? Megan Carter? Yeah, they used to see each other. I don't think they do anymore. Why? Who knows you're here? Nobody. You know what'd happen to me if this leaks. We can protect you. [ Laughs ] Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure. Okay, um-- We can call off the investigation, But I'm not sure about a statement in the paper. Then we got nothing to talk about. Here's a number where you can leave a message. When I read in the paper what I want, you get in touch. Let me think about it. Gallagher? [ Stereo: piano ] [ Doorbell rings ] Would you like to come in? Yeah. Could I fix you a drink? Oh, I don't think so. Work long hours. I was just writing a letter to my father. The loan shark. Yeah. You keep in touch, huh? Yes, we do. Most people nowadays telephone. It's not the same. It's easier to phone, but then what have you got? My daughter used to write letters. I mean, she'd stick crayon to paper, but she phones now. How old is she? Sixteen. I was, um, Trying to explain to my father... What happened. You know, the-- the other day when I took it all out on you-- Um, it isn't that simple. That's not an apology. I just wanted to set the record straight. That cost you, didn't it? Telling me about Rosen. Well, thanks. I didn't do it for you. I know that. Anyway-- It's a new blouse. Ohh. I'll get you your sweater. Thanks. Okay. What I told you about the story-- was it of any help? Yeah. Oh. Maybe see ya one of these days. I'd like that. Not against the rules? I'd like it anyway. Michael. I'd like it to be your idea. [ All chattering ] Candidate's coming out of the closet, huh? Come on in, Elliot. Get everybody down in the courtyard. See you guys in ten minutes. You want my endorsement? I'm flattered. I'm terminating the Gallagher investigation. Like hell you are. Okay. Let's call Washington. - And say what? - You say whatever you want. I'm going to say that you're running a bogus investigation... And that you're trying to coerce a private citizen into becoming a federal witness. You knew what I was doing. Yeah. I should've stopped you then. I'm gonna stop you now. You wanna join me in the statement? No, thanks. They're your cards. You play 'em. I have a very short statement to read. "The organized crime and racketeering strike force... Has recently completed an investigation of Michael Colin Gallagher... With regard to his possible involvement in the disappearance... Of joseph Diaz... And has found no grounds to proceed against Mr. Gallagher. Because this investigation was inadvertently reported in the press, It is the feeling of this office that it is only proper... To acknowledge its conclusion." That's it. [ Waddell ] I don't get it. You don't? Quinn just blew the whistle on both of us. You went after the wrong guy; I wrote about it. What the hell's going on? Good question. You oughta join the F.B.I. I don't know either. - I doesn't make any sense. - Got any ideas? Sure. Early retirement. I got a couple. I want 24-hour surveillance on Gallagher. Not close. And I want taps on three phones: Gallagher's warehouse; Gallagher at home; Quinn's house. Wait a minute. Where are we gonna find a judge that'll let us tap Quinn? I'm not gonna ask a judge. It's no good in court. I'm not in court. Not yet. You really think Gallagher bought him? I don't know. Do you think he's for sale? Mr. Gallagher? Yeah. Letter from The Standard. [ Van door opens, closes ] [ Engine starts ] [ Camera shutter clicking ] What are you doing? Are you leaving? What time is it? 5:30. I gotta go. Why? What happens at 5:30? I'll call you. I'm free every night but Friday. - How about Friday? - Okay. [ Phone rings ] Uh, this is Michael Gallagher. I'm somewhere else right now. If you wait for the tone, leave your name and number, I'll get back. [ Beep ] [ Man ] This is-- This is Quinn. We'd better get together to talk. [ Receiver clicks, buzzing ] Just keep watchin', buddy. [ Beep ] [ Man's voice, altered ] Our boy's getting nervous. He wants a meeting. Then there's one that says, "Our boy is getting nervous. He wants a meeting." "Our boy," huh? Unbelievable. [ Beep ] [ Man ] Matheson Hammock, day after Tomorrow. That's thursday, 11:00 a.m. Nine thousand dollars in cashier's checks. Three thousand and six thousand. Payable to the committee for a better Miami. "Committee for a better miami"? Wait a minute. Anonymous contributions... To a nonprofit organization with political interests. Specifically, Mr. James Quinn. Absolutely legal. Very nicely laundered. Yeah, except we caught him. All arranged through messages on a code-a-phone, so we can't prove he ever got them. Gallagher's no dummy. Oh, yeah? The meeting's arranged. 11:00 a.m. tomorrow, Matheson Hammock. Well, it's a professional job. We know that. There's talk that it might be two guys from New Jersey. We know that too. The paper said that, for christ's sake. [ Sighs ] Well, maybe they're right. I got my neck stuck out for you, Gallagher, And you'd better deliver. Now, I held up my end. You damn well better start holding up yours. Hey, you've been on this job for six months. I've been on it for a week. Now, I need something, and you'd better start delivering soon. Soon as I know. [ Camera shutter clicking ] Hey, Meg. Hi, Bob. Sorry. I'm late. I think you'll want to hear this. What? Between us. They can have my job for this. What are you talking about? Gallagher paid off Quinn. That's why he called off the investigation. I don't believe you. Get in the car. Those are his checks, Meg. Political contributions to Quinn. Well, he's under surveillance, so when you're with him you're-- Rosen will bust him if he can. Get out of it, Meg. Why are you telling me this? I don't want you hurt. Thanks. You can't use this. You sure as hell can't tell Gallagher. It'll mean my job. [ Doorbell rings ] Hi. Come on in. What'd you bring? A friendly bordeaux. Pretty good year. Want some right away? Sure. - Smells good. - What? The wine. Oh. Thanks. Is something bothering you? Quinn clearing you-- did you know he was gonna do that? No. He didn't tell you? No. It was a nice surprise, though. I bet. I'm taking the boat down to Bimini on sunday. You want to come along? Bimini? - How far away is that? - Oh, three, four hours. What else is around it? A lot of water. What happens if we miss it? You're gone for a long time. Why do you think he called that press conference? What? Quinn. Why do you think he called-- - What are you, working? - They don't usually call a press conference to-- Yeah, you told me. I remember. What do you think you know, Megan? Would you tell me the truth? I'd like to know the truth. Tell you or the whole world? - What's the difference? The truth is the truth. - No. You want to know the truth? Ask me as a person, I'll tell ya. - Ask me as a reporter, I got no comment. - That's not fair. Not fair to who? Wait a minute! You don't write the truth. You write what people say. You overhear. You eavesdrop. You don't come across truth that easy. Maybe it's just what you think, what you feel. I don't need your goddamn newspaper... To decide what they're gonna do with me or who I am. Then you tell me. Who are you? You mean you're not sure yet? No. Well, I guess you'll just have to decide for yourself. I mean, who I am and what you are. Michael. Would you just answer me one question? Quinn's statement-- did you do anything wrong to get it? What's "wrong"? You know what wrong is. That's right. I do. Well? Tell me. I'm sorry. I won't. [ Sighs ] I guess you just did. Things are not what they seem. Not always. You oughta know that. They usually are. Okay. Mac? It's Meg. Jim, listen, I'm sorry about this, But I have a story that says you're suspected of taking bribes from Michael Gallagher. I would like to hear your comment. I'd say you've got your information mixed-up. Either that, or you're fishing. - Wait a minute. That was off the record. - My question was on the record. No comment, goddamn it. Now slow down and tell me what you're talking about. - You get to him? - I need someone for dictating. Okay, go. This is insert "a" after the fifth graph ending "xxx" clearing Gallagher. Paragraph. Quinn denied-- What the-- ha-ha! [ Sighs ] Elving, go yourself down the hall there and collect our friend. [ Quinn ] Hello, Jim. Good morning, fellas. Angeline, quickly, please. What are you doing? We'll be just a second here, please, sir. Have a seat, folks. Well, now, let the record show that I am James J. Wells, Assistant attorney general for the organized crime division... Of the united states department of justice. With me here are-- Oh, hell, Angie, you know who these folks are. Just write 'em in. I've had no conversation with anyone here... Prior to the beginning of this record. At this time I'd like to inform all present they have the right to remain silent... And the right to retain counsel. I inform them further that anything they say during the course of this, uh-- What the hell is this? This inquiry-- May be taken down and used against 'em. Anybody here want a lawyer? No. No. Miss Carter, you brought your own. Mr. Gallagher, do you want a lawyer, sir? No. [ Wells ] Good. Ain't no more room in here anyway. Anybody wanna read the paper? You got a story in here says strike force investigating the D.A. Suspected bribes. It's the damnedest story you ever read. Nobody in this department ever read a story quite like that. Tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna sit right here and talk about it. Now, if you get tired of talking here, Mr. Marshal Elving Patrick will hand you one of them subpoenas he's got in his pocket, We'll go downstairs and talk in front of the grand jury. Now, we'll talk all day, if you want to. But come sundown there's gonna be two things true that ain't true now. One is that the united states department of justice is going to know... What in the good christ-- Excuse me, Angie-- Is going on around here. And the other is, I'm gonna have somebody's ass in my briefcase. Elliot? Jim? Fine. All right, Elving, hand whichever one of these fellas you like a subpoena. We'll go talk in front of the grand jury. - Gallagher's a government witness. - Wonderful thing, a subpoena. He's working on Diaz, reporting to me. Your arrangements include campaign contributions? What are you talking about? I'm talking about $9,000. Cashier's checks. It's all in the file, Jim. - What file? - This file. Rosen's investigation file. You can't have a investigation without a file, jim. Let me see that. I'll save you lookin'. It says you met with Gallagher, didn't report it. Says Gallagher give money to some committee thinks you're pretty. Got phone taps. Not legal, mind you, but I got phone taps of you talking on Gallagher's answering machine. You son of a bitch. He don't think much of your investigation, Elliot. Jim, why didn't you report that meeting? [ Stammering ] That was Gallagher. Those were his rules. H-he said he wanted to deal only with me. We had had a leak-- [ wells ] You'd had a leak? You call what's going on around here a leak? The last time there was a leak like this, Noah built hisself a boat. Now, look, I don't know anything about any cashier's checks. Now, Gallagher said he would listen for us if we quit hassling him. - He wanted a public statement. - And he got it. Robert, where'd you get the authority to run those taps? No place. I just did it. You wanna tell me why you'd go and do a damn fool thing like that? You see, we had... A reason to believe that-- He was acting on my instructions. He don't get paid to act on your instructions. He gets paid to abide by and to enforce the law. Elliot... How's come you're investigating the D.A. without telling the department? It was preliminary. We had cause, but no case. Do you think you have a case now? - I think so. - Make it. Here? I-in front of them? Do you know somethin' that ain't already all over the newspapers? Go ahead and make your case. It'll be good practice for ya. Mr. Gallagher, you know Mr. Quinn? - Yeah. - How do you know him? He asked me if I would help him find out what happened to Joey Diaz. I show you photostats of two cashier's checks, Drawn on the flagship national bank, Made payable to the committee for a better Miami. [ Rosen ] Have you seen them before? Yeah. They're mine. For what purpose did you make these checks? To contribute to the committee. Well, why was that? Because they do good work. You aware the committee is interested in the political career of Mr., Uh, Quinn? So? That's okay with me. All right, let me point out that these checks were drawn... Immediately before... And immediately after your meeting with Mr. Quinn. What do you make of that? What do you make of it? Are you trying to say you got an urge to contribute to his committee... Before you met with him, And then got another urge right after? Yeah. I came into some extra money a couple days later. You made these contributions anonymously. Why? I wanted them to be anonymous. - I'll bet. Tell us why. - I didn't want other people asking for contributions. The reason you made these contributions anonymously is that you were paying off. Prove it. Mr. Gallagher... If you, in fact, told Mr. Quinn you would act as a government informant, then why-- Wait a minute. I said that I'd see what I could find out. - What are you finding out? - Nothin'. Nobody wants to talk about it. You son of a bitch. You're trying to frame me. Now, he set me up. He arranged the meetings. He is the one who got me on his answering machine. - He's got the canceled checks. He is trying to frame me! - What's his motive? To get even, you dummy. You two guys oughta get married. Mr. Gallagher, are you that smart? [ Quinn ] You're damn right he is. Ms. Carter. You seem to know a lot about what's going on around here. I'd like to ask you where these stories came from. - Objection. My client-- - You save your objections, counselor. This ain't a courtroom. Now, Ms. Carter, this story about Mr. Gallagher-- the first one. I had reason to believe the strike force... Was investigating Mr. Gallagher. - I confirmed it, I wrote the story. - How did you confirm it? Objection. You are asking her-- wait a minute. I want to answer this. I read the file. [ Wells ] Did you, now? How did you come to read the file? I was talking with Mr. Rosen. It was lying on his desk, and when he left his office I read it. Did you ask Mr. Rosen... What in the name of christ he was doing leaving the file on his desk for you to read it? - He intended me to read it. - Why, Ms. Carter? So that I would write a story that made Mr. Gallagher look bad. [ Megan sighs ] This story. Mr. Rosen give you that one too? No. Go ahead, Ms. Carter. I'm sorry. I can't tell you. I think I know where we're headed here. Before we get there, I wanna say something to you. You know we can't tell you what to print... Or what not to. We hope you people in the press will act responsibly, But when you don't there ain't a lot anybody can do about it. But we can't have people go around leakin' stuff for their own reasons. It ain't legal. And worse than that, by god, it ain't right. I can't stop you, but I can damn well stop them. I wanna know where them stories come from. Under the first amendment, my client is not required to reveal her sources-- That's horse pucky, counselor. The first amendment don't say that. The privilege don't exist. Ms. Carter, do you understand I can ask you these questions in front of a grand jury? Yes. And if you don't answer, you could go to jail? I know it's possible, yes. Oh, it's more than possible, Ms. Carter. It's damned likely. Now, I ain't anxious to be locking up reporters, But I'm gonna tell you something-- I don't like what's goin' on around here. May I say something, please? Yes. I don't want to go to jail... But this has got to stop someplace. A lot of damage has been done. I'm responsible for a lot of it. I know that. [ Sighs ] I don't-- I don't know, I-- I keep thinking there must be some rules to tell me what I'm supposed to do now, but maybe... Not. The person who told me about the investigation of Mr. Quinn, they were not leaking it. They did not intend for it to be printed. I did that on my own. I'm scared to death of going to jail, But if I tell you who it was you'll have to do something about it, And then someone else will be hurt. So it's really very simple-- I can hurt someone or not hurt someone. No rules. Just... Me. I can't tell you. Mr. Gallagher. I seem to want to ask if you set all this up. If I do, you ain't gonna tell me, are ya? No. I tell you something. You're a smart fella. Don't get too smart. Pretty smart myself. Everybody in the room is smart. Everybody's just doing their job. And Teresa Perrone's dead. Who do I see about that? Ain't nobody to see. I wish there was. You're excused now, sir. [ Door closes ] Ms. Carter, you can go too. Later today I'll have a statement for the media. You ain't gonna like it. It's gonna say Mr. Quinn here May not be the smartest D.A. We've ever had around, but there's no evidence suspecting him of anything. And it's gonna say you were suckered by Mr. Rosen here, who has some peculiar ideas on how to do his job. It's gonna say it was premature and real wrong... That these investigations ever got reported in the first place. You don't have to print it, of course, but it's gonna wind up in the paper. Angeline, you and Elving go on ahead. Robert, you can go too. I'll be along in a minute. Jim, you're in a bad place, boy. I could talk myself blue clearing you, but... Wouldn't nobody believe me. You got a hell of a publicity problem. I could sue. Who? You can't win. Absent malice. What can you prove? You sayin' I should resign? The president appointed you. I ain't the one to be kickin' you out. But I'm suggestin'. [ Sighs ] I'll talk to you later. [ Sighs ] [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] It's really too bad. I'm sorry. Yeah. He's a nice guy. He just forgot about the rules. Elliot, what'd you figure you'd do after government service? - I'm not quitting. - You ain't no presidential appointee, Elliot. The one that hired you was me. You got 30 days. Uh, would you excuse me for a moment, please? Well... You got us all, didn't you, Michael? You got yourselves. How'd you know I'd get the story? I knew somebody would. I'm sorry it was you. How'd you know I'd print it? It's news, isn't it? Nothing's going to be answered. Just make sure that-- Davidek filled me in on it. We're not gonna retract anything, but we've got a lot of explaining to do. Sarah's gonna write the story, and we'll handle it the best way we can. I need to know how to describe your relationship with Gallagher. Mac said to quote you directly. Say whatever you want. [ Sighs ] Just... Say we were involved. That's true, isn't it? No. But it's accurate. Hot, huh? Not so hot, really. I went by your house. There's a "for sale" sign out. Yeah. It's sold. Got a good price. You got some sun. Yeah. I've been sitting on the beach. We were pretty famous for a week. Did you read the story? Nope. You want a beer? Sure. Where you headed? I don't know. - I guess I got a couple of moves left in me. - But you don't know where. Not sure. People are going south and west, but, uh, I think I'll go north and east. You can go clear to the Hudson River-- I mean, clear to Canada-- On the Inland Waterway. Northeast. I was raised in the northeast. I had my first job there the summer when I was 16 on the Berkshire Eagle. I wonder if they'd have me back. Feelin' sorry for yourself? I know you think what I do for a living... Is nothing. But it really isn't nothing. I just did it badly. Why do I get the feeling your going northeast has something to do with your daughter? You probably are a hell of a reporter. Not yet. Have a good trip. I get the feeling I wanna say... "Could I write?" But I'm afraid to hear your answer. Maybe see you one of these days. I'd like that. - Be well. - You too.
