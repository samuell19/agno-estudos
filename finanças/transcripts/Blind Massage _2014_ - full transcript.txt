Shaanxi Culture Industry Investment Holdings (Group) Co., Ltd Shaanxi Culture Industry (Film & TV) Yinhai Investment Co., Ltd Present Produced by Wong Yong Chief Executive Producer Li Anjun with a Dream Factory and Les Film du Lendemain Production The story begins with a young boy named Xiao Ma, on an evening many years ago when a smear of light left him unconscious. It was the last light Xiao Ma would ever see. From then on it was as though he was in an endless night, surrounded by the scent of shadows. A car accident had taken his eyes and his mother, leaving him blind in a world filled with sound. Everyone told Xiao Ma that it was only temporary, that with time he would heal... that he would see again. Believing them, Xiao Ma waited for that day to come. A long time passed before he finally realized that everyone had deceived him, that it all was just a lie. That will be the end of his life. As a father, you should tell him the truth. Doctor, we've been to every hospital in China, You're our last hope! Xiao Ma, what are you doing here? Are you eating, Auntie? Have you eaten? I've got some here. Have some. Come, Xiao Ma. Take it. Take your time. Doctor! Help! Quick! Call someone! Get a doctor! Help! Hurry! After that, Xiao Ma was sent to a school for the blind. There, everyone was just like him. He had many friends and classmates, learned Braille, how to walk, how to overcome obstacles. And how to live among normal people. He also learned the art of massage. As with any blind massage student, after graduation Xiao Ma was placed at a massage treatment center. He didn't know that his luck was about to change... The name of the center was Sha Zongqi. There were two bosses. One was named Zhang Zongqi. He lost his sight as a child in a medical accident. He always had a lot of clients, and was a very serious man. The other boss, Sha Fuming, was different, always drawing attention to himself. Besides Chinese medicine and massage, he had a lot of other interests. It was a time when those who worked hard made money. It was also the golden age of blind massage. Boss Sha! It's Xiao Xiang. It's Xiao Xiang. This is Boss Sha. Xiao Xiang. - Boss Sha, good to see you. - Hello! Boss Sha, have a seat. Boss Sha, may I ask your full name? Please don't call me Boss Sha. My name is Sha Fuming. Sha as in sand, Fu as in recovering, Ming as in light. Just call me Brother Fuming. Ok, ok. Brother Fuming. And you? Can you tell? I can't read characters. I don't believe it. You're illiterate? Not illiterate, I just can't read characters. I read Braille. It's a relatively new language. It was created by a man named Huang. Huang Nai. Having a language like Braille is like giving sight to the blind. Many of us have become teachers, even writers and musicians. For me, Braille... Go on, go on, we're listening. Have some more. You taught yourself? Yes, self-taught. Also poetry... - Xiao Xiang knows. - Yes, I know. I also study poetry. I wouldn't say study. Seems you're quite well-read. I like San Mao. Hai Zi too. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's fine, no problem. Hello, Boss Sha! How's business? No one's starving. Sorry sir, who's calling? Sir? Since when have I been 'sir'? It's Lao Wang, from school. What? How's Shenzhen? Don't talk to me about Shenzhen. You've got it good. I don't know where my next meal's coming from. I'm hoping there's room at an old classmate's table. You're kidding. I'm serious. I'm here in Nanjing. If it's ok, I'd like to come and work for you. If not... I'll think of something. But I've got another mouth to feed. You old dog! How are her eyes? A little better than mine. You really are a dog. See you tomorrow! Ok. Kong, we'll take a look tomorrow. If it's ok, we can start the next day. Great. Whatever you like. I thought he sounded pretty good. It's a great learning opportunity. Why do you think we're here? To find our daughter a partner, not a teacher. Can't he be both? Excuse me! Mom! See you later! Sha Fuming's attempts to find a partner failed again. But he didn't give up. In that moment he found something more important than a wife. The 'mainstream society'. The blind have a strong belief that the world of the sighted is mainstream society. After the harvest on the deserted land, the people had taken a year's worth of crops. They took the grain. They took the horses.

Du Hong, were you born with it? You could say that. Her name is Du Hong. She's new. You are valued clients. I was afraid she wouldn't be good enough. She's beautiful, did you know? How would I?

He's much smarter than you. Rest, Xiao Kong. I'm just listening. I can't see a thing. Over here. Sorry, that's not what I meant. Don't take it wrong. Your skin's much better since you got to Nanjing. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law, look. This one looks great! Good, right? It matches her colour. What? Brother, I need to talk to you. Lend me some money. I've lost a lot on the markets. I don't know when I can open my own shop. Just twenty thousand. We'll talk later. Get some rest. You're moving to the dorm tomorrow. Sleep with her tonight. Just see if she still wants to run off tomorrow. Go to sleep. Do as I told you! The time is 11:16PM. Baby, how many people are we? One. That's right. We're one. Whatever you're thinking, or want to say, I already know. But Baoyu had many servants, all glib and charming. How could she ever find a chance to put herself forward... Sister-in-law, you're here! Ay? Sister-in-law! Here! Sit next to me. Have some candy. Sister-in-law, sit here. I just washed the blanket. Who'd sit with you! All newcomers must pass the interrogation. No exceptions. First something to warm up our brains. Brother and Sister-in-law hug in the nude. We need four words to express this. Which four words? Taihe, do you know? No idea. Zhang Yiguang, don't be a pig. Sister-in-law, which four words? Which four? Do you know? Big Boobs No Dick. Xiao Ma! They bully me and you don't help? You don't help! You're laughing, you're terrible! - You're terrible! - Xiao Ma is terrible! I'm not, Sister-in-law. Go to hell, Xiao Ma! I thought you were a nice guy. You're worse than terrible. Still won't help me? You're terrible! - Xiao Kong! - You're terrible! - How am I terrible? - Hit him, sister! Hit him! Hit him hard! Hard, sister! Xiao Kong! Hit him hard, sister! Quick! Hit him! Sister-in-law! Hard him hard, sister! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! I'm not your sister-in-law! I'm Xiao Kong. You're not Xiao Kong. You're my sister-in-law. Time for bed. I'll walk you back. That's so annoying! Clack-clack. You're a real beast! A wild beast! You're wrong, sister-in-law. Getting worse all the time! I'm not. You still deny it? Terrible! Doctor Du Hong is here. Don't forget your things. Stop it! Stop it! Try it to see if it's sweet. What is it eating? Vegetables. You're such a chicken! See, it's fine. This turtle's name is Tingting. Is it eating? Put in on his neck! Sister-in-law! I'm not criticizing you. Someone your age still can't take care of yourself. Have another. What kind of life is this? I'm dying here. Taihe, finished? Yes. Here, sit down, eat. Fine, let's eat! This is for you. There's the water. Taihe Am I nice? Yes. Do you love me? I do. Do you think about me when we're apart? Yes. Will you be good to me forever? Yes. You should know, I'm really pretty. Like a princess. Did you know that? I know now. There's something else I've never told you. Here at the center, Duhong is pretty, right? She's the prettiest. Well, I'm the second. Taihe, do you know, your wife is the second prettiest. Runner up! You're the silver medallist, Taihe! They'll hoist the flag for you. Did you know that? I know. Here, feel. Pretty, right? Pretty. So, tell me. Tell me. Say it! Please try. Taihe, say it. You're prettier than... stewed pork. Come on, Du Li, take one more. I'm fine. I've still got one. Save it for later. Dr. Du Hong, Baihui Room, bed two. That's wrong. It's not her turn yet. I'll take a look. Have some more. I'm ok. Please go in. - Gao Wei! - What's up? Is it Dr. Du Hong's turn? The client asked for her specifically. Dr. Du Hong, your client... Hello! Hello! Relax. Professor Wei, look how lovely she is. You're right, she's a beauty. Look at her face, her figure... Beautifully proportioned. Boss Sha, were you looking for me? Du Hong... There is something... Sit down. Tell me Du Hong, please. I just want to know how beauty feels. Have you touched it? You know how it feels now? No, I don't. I was blind by one. Almost from birth. I've never pitied myself, never... Until today. What is beauty? It obsesses me... All the time, night and day, I just want to look at you. Du Hong... Beauty is attractive, isn't it? Beauty was a disaster whose time had come. Sha Fuming had felt the essence of Du Hong's and though he still didn't fully understand the importance of a woman's appearance, he knew one thing for certain. Love and beauty could be the same thing. He had to hold on to Du Hong. Du Hong! It's me, Boss Sha. Du Hong Stop talking about it! About what? What's beautiful or not. It means nothing to me! It's like a joke. How can it be a joke? How can it not be? This didn't happen to you, of course you don't understand. But people talk about me every day... Be quiet! Quiet! Why get mad? Du Hong, I just hope... you can stay here. Forever. Are you giving me an ultimatum? How is that an ultimatum? How is it not? If I refuse you'll throw me out, right? Isn't that an ultimatum? When you put it like that, and the worst kind. But when did I say - I'd throw you out if you refused? - Dr. Du Hong. Tianzhong Room, bed two. Ok, let's keep it simple. Do you love me at all? You think you love me but it's just vanity... Obsession. That's all! That's not love, ok? No woman is blind to true love. Especially one without eyes. Dr. Du Hong, your client is waiting. Fucking asshole! Calm down. Piece of shit! Ok, meeting now. Quiet, please. Ok, quiet. Let's start the meeting. Boss Sha, can I say something first? Go ahead! Do the tricycles belong to the center or to individuals? Is the rule about center property still in effect or not? Dr. Zhang, thank you! You have great hands. Thank you! Take care! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! What are you doing? Sister-in-law! What are you doing, Xiao Ma? Let me go! Xiao Ma was overcome by his feelings. He noticed a strange scent running through him. Zhang Yiguang smelled it too. Later he told him you smelled it before an explosion. A deadly scent. He'd smelled it when he was a miner. There was a boom, everyone was knocked to the ground. Fortunately Zhang Yiguang was already blind. In a moment of bad luck a flying rock took out his eyes. But even blind, it was clear... He had to rescue this lost boy. There's no point thinking of her like that. Worse to bottle it up, there'll be trouble. Fuck off! Come on. Cut the shit! You can't fool me. Who wasn't young once? In the mines, they called me Captain Jerk-Off. I'm saving you. I'm not going with you. See? You're acting like a child. Brother Guang! Come on, Xiao Man! I'm not going in. Brother Guang! Xiao Ya! Give this to Xiao Ya Come on. Got to make me look good! Sit! Ridiculous! Mann, let me introduce, my pal, Xiao Ma. This is Mann, I told you about her. Stop being silly. Come, come... Nothing to be scared of. Mann will take good care of you. Brother Guang, tell me, aren't you afraid she'll dump you after you bring such a handsome guy? Mann's a good girl, sweet as honey. My heart is broken. Just relax. Listen, that costs extra. Yin and Yang and the five elements of traditional Chinese medicine. Understanding the normal physiological functioning of the body as well as the onset of pathological changes... Ten. I follow. Xiao Ma. We're playing cards. Extrusion or paraphysis, both are very common. Got it? I think so. Here. Look! You can't sit like that. Why not? Manager Sha forbids it. It's not like he can see me. It's now - Doctor Wang? - 14:30pm. Taihe? It's pissing down. Smoke? You know I don't. Me neither. It's nice not to be busy for once. I'll take one. Please. Ouch, please be gentle! Really, I just started. Such a sexy belly. Taihe must like it. Tell me, have you two done it? Not yet. I want to save it for our wedding night. You and Dr. Wang are so happy. Kong, you'll definitely get married before we do. Tell me when the day comes. Xiao Kong? Xiao Kong? What's wrong? Xiao Kong? Come here. What's wrong? Yan... Don't cry. What's wrong? Yan My parents don't approve of me and Wang. Why not? They won't let me marry a man who's fully blind. They've invested everything in me. They don't even know I'm in Nanjing. I'm using two cellphones. They think I'm in Shenzhen. Don't cry. Let's play a game. Two blind people are hugging. Oh, this one... Blind hug. Two blind people are touching. Blind touch. Two blind people are whispering. Blind talk. You talk blind! - You talk blind... - You talk blind... Xiao Ma, are you leaving? It's raining. It's alright. It's pissing down. You can stay till the rain stops. No, I have to go back. I'll walk you then. It's too dangerous for you to go alone. Ok, I'll stay for a bit. Good. Mann and Xiao Ma both liked good stories. Fiction or non-fiction, real or fantasy, Mann liked them all. After all, all stories are lies. Lies are interesting... Lies are funny... Like playing house. Whether Mann was pretending to be real, really being fake or pretending to be fake, Xiao Ma didn't care. After all, he couldn't see the difference. Hello! Brother Xiao Ma! Xiao Ma? Did I bump into you? Let's eat! We're having lamb. Wait! Everyone hold on. I have something to say. There are three pieces of lamb in my lunch box. Du Li, how many in yours? Count them. The doctors can't see. You can. You count for us. I didn't serve the food, it's none of my business. I haven't touched it, Why should I count? You're right. You didn't serve the food. Sister Jin, you served it, right? So you count. You won't? I'll do it. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. - Gao Wei, enough! - Six. - All for a few bits of meat. - Seven. Eight. Nine. Shall I keep going, Sister Jin? You spent the center's money instead of your own. Our deeds are seen by the heavens. Du Li, could you confirm whether I'm lying or not? It's none of my business! Corruption, even in a small massage center. Sister Jin, what's wrong? I've packed. I'm leaving tonight. Sister Jin, why are you doing this? Stop crying. What time is it, Sister Jin? You don't sleep. How are we supposed to? Everyone has to work tomorrow. All this nonsense! About what? You're making such a fuss. Did we say anything? No one said anything. You're the one screaming and crying. Why? No one blames you! Yet you are crying like a baby. For what? What are you screaming about? Everyone go back to sleep. Everyone, back to sleep! Do you know what time it is? Where's your sense of social conduct? Everyone back to bed! Xiao Tang, take her back. Hurry, hurry, everyone back! It's now 11:39 PM. You're back. Mom! What's the matter? Dad! This is the older brother? We have guests? How should I address you? Why ask me? You can ask your younger brother. Mom, pour some tea for our guests. Dr. Wang, we're here for our money. Who owes you money? Your brother. We have his IOU. We don't acknowledge people, only signatures. My dad doesn't owe you money. - Nor does my mom... - Doctor Wang, we respect rules. We just want our money back. If it can't be done, that's fine Someone else will sort it. Whatever you want, come to me, leave my parents alone. We can't do that. What the hell do you want? Our money. What about justice? This isn't justice. It's the law. We'll give you extra time. What do you mean they just showed up? Aren't you afraid they could hurt Mom and Dad? It's not much money. Who'd pull a knife for so little? How can you borrow money and not pay it back? I didn't say I wouldn't pay it back. So do it. I'm broke. What's the problem? Broke or not, you have to pay it back. Kong, I need to talk to you. Kong, let me talk to you first... My little brother... Owes someone money. Get up there! Up! I want to give him our wedding money. We'll just postpone it. Ok? Ok? Get down now! Get dressed! Here are yours. Mine! Don't be angry. - Why are you so mad? - Of course I'm mad! I gave you everything. Who's going to want me? What are you talking about? I came all the way to Nanjing! But now you're bullshiting me! Brother Xiao Ma, Mann's with a client. I'll find you another girl. Better than Mann, I promise. I will wait. What are you always sniffing? I don't know. You don't know? If I knew, I wouldn't. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! What's up? Sister-in-law! I'm sorry. It's in the past. No need to bring it up. You were just being impulsive. You didn't mean anything. I don't hate you. Sister-in-law, I'm truly sorry! Don't worry. Forget it. It's long gone. I didn't tell anyone. Him neither. What are you doing? What are you doing, Xiao Ma? Sister-in-law, I'm so sorry! Are you getting in? Getting in or not? Get out! Open the door for me! Where to, boss? Park Road market. The blind and the sighted are not equal. It's simple. The blind are in the light, while the sighted hide in the shadows. This is why the blind and the sighted keep to themselves. In the minds of the blind, the sighted are an entirely different species. A dominant animal... An animal with eyes... An all-seeing creature, possessed of an almost spiritual significance. Their attitude to the sighted is like that of the sighted to the gods: Respective, but kept at a distance. It's now 5:40 PM. Big Brother. We've been waiting for you. Brother and Sister-in-law, you're both here? Yes. Did you bring the money? I'm here, Big Brother! Get out! Get out of here! You don't deserve to stay in this house! Get out of here! He can't leave. He goes, I give you the money. He stays, I don't pay. Take your time. Go! Get out of here! Son, put the knife down! What are you thinking of? Why are you doing this? Do you know what the blind love best? Money. Have you seen blind beggars on the street? Son! No! Yes, I have. Begging for money, I can do that. But I won't. We have dignity too. We want this dignity, and we cherish our dignity too. Son, stop this! We have to treat ourselves as humans! I have to treat myself as a human! As a human! Son, Stop! My son, please stop this! I won't give you the money, but I can't refuse to repay the debt. So you'll have to accept blood. Son! Son, stop this! Please stop this! I... I only have a little stash. You can have it all! All of it! Is that enough? Is it enough? Is that enough? I have a life too. Let me finish! Is this enough? Enough! Fuck this blind cunt! My son! My son! Why did you do this? We'll go to the hospital! I'm sorry. It's Dad who should be sorry. This is not me. We know, son. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have said those things to Lao Wang. It's all my fault. Boss Sha, your client is waiting in the Yuzhen Room. I'm coming. What's with you, Mann? Not falling for the little blind guy? Are you stupid? Don't get yourself in trouble. He's not wealthy. Are you blind too? You're the blind ones! Take care. Dr. Wang is back. Dr. Wang is back. Feeling better? Much. Dr. Wang! Lao Wang is back. Boss Sha, I'm back. Good to see you, Dr. Wang! You brought me so much fruit, Boss Zhang. You're welcome. Feeling better? Jin Yan! Massage, handsome? Quick! Don't arrest him, he's blind. That doesn't mean he gets to break the law. Separate them. Girls in this car. Go! You see, for this case, you can't rush to a solution. Self-esteem is one thing. We have to look out for him. What do you think? If we don't worry about his well-being, we could easily just let him go. Thanks a lot, officers! Sorry for the trouble. Take care. Anyone here? Cry if you want. Don't hold it in. Why should I cry? Then don't. Bottle it up. Actually, I want to cry myself. Why do you want to cry? Everyone's tears are different, but their reasons for crying are the same. That's why I'm not crying. I'm not crying. What good are tears? Xiao Ma, here's a question. What's the difference between a person coming towards you and a car coming towards you? One's a person, the other's a car. If it's a person, and you bump into him, that's love. If it's a car and you bump into it, that's a crash. But cars are always bumping into each other. People tend to move aside. Baihui Room, bed three. Who's there? Boss Sha? Brother San! Hello, Xiao Ma! I'm sorry, Mann isn't here today. She's out. She just left. Where did she go? She didn't say. When will she be back? We don't know that either. Why not come back later? What are you doing? Let me walk you out. Xiao Ma! How about Guoguo instead? Ok? That's just Jiaojiao. Mann isn't here today. Mann! Mann! Mann! Mann! Open the door! Open the door! Don't hit him! He's blind! Get up! Get up! Get up now! Stop it! Stop hitting him! Get up! He's blind, Brother San! He's blind! Stop hitting him! Take is easy, take is easy! I'll kick the shit out of you! Go back! Watch the step! Du Li, what happened to Dr. Xiao Ma? No idea. He told me he fell. He's got blood all over his face. Dr. Du Hong. Zhongtian Room, bed two. Boss Sha, your client is waiting. On my way. Boss Sha! Xiao Ma! He's got doctors and family in the hospital. Now you have to take care of him... Tingting? What are you doing? Listening to music. Are we bothering you? Not at all... Dr. Xiao Ma, Baihui Room, bed three. Xiao Ma, are you fucking blind? Gao Wei, I'm sorry! Did I tread on you? It's fine. Ok, sit on the couch. Please wait a moment. Du Hong! Xiao Ma? Let me tell you a secret. What secret? You're very pretty. You just realized that now? This is our Boss Zhang. Hello, Boss Zhang! Hello! Where does it hurt? My neck feels funny. Lie on your stomach. There's no rush. Take your time. What are the symptoms? - Du Hong! - Yes! We're leaving. Hurry up! Don't rush, Tingting, I'll wait for you. It'll be over soon. Ah, The power died! What happened? Gao Wei, the power died. Can you walk down now? No I can't! Did you forget to pay the bill? I did pay. I can't see anything. Now you're blind! Eyes have different functions. Some eyes can see the light... The others can see the dark. You'd better follow us now. Gao Wei, you go first. I'll wait for Tingting. Ok, I'm off. Don't be too late. Tingting! Du Hong, what's wrong? My hand! My hand! Oh my god! How did it happen? What happened, Du Hong? Du Hong! Somebody help! What's wrong? Somebody help! What's wrong? Her hand! What happened? Call a taxi! Call a taxi! To the hospital! Who is that? Xiao Ma? She doesn't love you. Listen to your friend. I see it clearly. Your heart is full of her, but you are not in her heart. It's not her fault, is it? You're right. Let's figure out how to help her. I'm working on it. This is from Tingting and me. Xiao Kong. From Wang and me. Ok. From Du Li... Ok, Du Li neither sad nor happy. One half planted in the earth, the other flying in the wind. One half giving cool shade, the other bathed in the sun. Deep in silence. Deep with dignity. Never in need. Never seeking. If there is a next life, I'd like to be a tree. Forever standing neither sad nor happy. One half planted in the earth, the other flying in the wind. Deep in silence. Deep with dignity. Hey handsome! Massage! Hello, Xiao Ma! Xiao Ya! It's been a long time! This way. Careful. She's out back. I'll take you to her. Let me put on my coat. Ok, Let's go. After that nobody ever saw Mann or Xiao Ma again. They simply disappeared. No one knew where they went. Fate is truly unpredictable. In the face of fate, both the blind and the sighted are equally superstitious. More or less superstitious. Both believe in fate. Because fate cannot be seen, and the blind cannot see, the blind understand fate better than the sighted. To the blind the things you see aren't necessarily real... It's what you can't see that exists. Hello, the phone you are calling is powered off. Hello, the phone you are calling is powered off. We're back! Dr. Du Hong is back! Du Li! Du Hong, you're back at last! We've missed you. Du Hong is back! Brother Guang! Du Hong! All better? I've missed you! Tonight's feast is on me! To welcome Du Hong back! - Roast lamb? - Sure, anything is good. This is from everyone. Just a token of our regard. Everyone chipped in. Just a small token. Dr. Jin Yan. Baihui Room, bed five. Dr. Zhang Yi Guang. Zhongtian Room, bed three. Back to work. - Gao Wei! - Yes. What is it? Hold on to this for me. What is it? Don't ask, just keep it for me. Where are you going? Du Hong, where are you going? Du Hong? Boss Sha! Where are you going with your bag? Nowhere. Just for a walk. I'll have Gao Wei take you back to the dorm later. - Go and get some rest. - I'm fine... - I sorted everything for you. - Boss Sha, come and dance. Ok! - Boss Sha... - I sorted everything for you. Take your time. Everyone's so happy to see you back. Can't you tell? Cheer up! Follow me! I'm sorry. It's alright. Ready, go! Du Hong? Du Hong! Dear brothers and sisters, Please forgive my leaving without saying goodbye. You've all done so much since my accident. I truly appreciate all the care and help you've given me, but I can't be a burden any more. Don't worry, I'll work hard and survive in my own way. Brother Fuming, I don't know how to thank you. I wish you happiness. Everyone get ready. Dinner together tonight. We've all been working hard. Let's eat well. Get ready. Come on in! So many of you today! Are you celebrating? Come here, Boss Sha! Eat, everyone eat! We're all here, let's take a photo. Boss! What's up? I'll get help! I'm getting your friends! Hurry! I haven't drunk anything yet. Why am I throwing up? Fuming! Where's he? Fuming!

"I have forgotten her name," "I've forgotten her face." "Mother," "I had a dream," "I dreamed of a rainbow." "At last it appeared in my sky." "But I..." "I had forgotten the colors." "What does the end of the rainbow look like?" "My beloved girl," "she consumed my eyes, little by little." "In my world," "there is only red."
