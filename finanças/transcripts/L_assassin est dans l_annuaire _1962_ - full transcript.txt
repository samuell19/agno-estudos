- Mr Rimoldi... - Yes? Mr Rimoldi... I've got something very important to tell you. - Really? - Yes. I need to confide in you. - In me? - Yes... Yes, in you. The boss wants to see you. Oh yes... Look at them! That's enough! Alright. Congratulations. He who laughs last, laughs loudest! As I'm the last of the idiots that'll be me, Mr Martel. Come in! Hello, Rimoldi. - Sir. - Sit down. You're a disappointment. I know, Sir, I know. I've made a startling discovery. "Startling"? How could you, the most dedicated employee we have... ...forget to ask for the raise that I'd promised you, Oh yes... the raise. Fortunately, I don't forget things. I'll fix this injustice. What "injustice"? You saved my life. Without you, I'd be dead from hunger and despair. Remember that, Sir! Let's not get carried away! You've given me dignity, and to show my gratitude... ...is the main aim of my life. Sadly, I don't measure up. So it seems. I'm making you auditor. "Auditor"? No, that's too much, Sir. You've got a good job now... So get married! That requires 2 people. Maybe it'd be difficult for you. Difficult? Well you know I don't expect to win a beauty competition. The things I need to show most are affection... ...and understanding. You could do that. Yes, but I'd have to work on it. I'm so clumsy. The woman would need to fall from the heavens. Like an angel? Exactly. It's an angel that I dream of. I don't believe in miracles. The wedding is not for tomorrow. That depends. I need to give it some thought. We'll talk about this again. Thank you Mr Leclerc. You've given me new hope. In time. Have a nice weekend. You too, Sir. "Have a nice weekend"... Come along! You'll be in trouble! Get going! Love doesn't seem to affect your appetite. At it again on Sunday? When are we gonna meet her? It'll never happen... He'd worry that I'd take her from him. I see what you mean... Someone even stupider than me would jump on her! The man's a wit! He aced you! We're out of time. No revenge? Can you take my stamp off? Right away. Nearly finished. Wait... Don't move. You lose. No... that's mine. Mine. - You'll keep the Japanese ones for me? - Sure. A dry white please. I nearly forgot. I have a letter for you. A letter? Yes. A young woman gave it to me last night. A young woman? I didn't want to talk about it. They hadn't finished poking fun at you. Thanks. Dear Sir... Alone in life, hurt by the brutality and egotism of men... ...I knew by seeing you that your sweetness and kindness... ...could give me hope. That day, anonymous and lost among the customers of your bank... "...I looked at you for a long time." Okay, see you later. I fully trust my intuition. I feel that you'd be able to find... ...words that can make me enjoy life. Come to my rescue. One more. I'll wait for you on Monday at 12.30 ...in Boieldieu Park, on the bench, between the fir trees. I'll be wearing a white fur hat... ...and holding a copy of 'Bonjour Tristesse' by Francoise Sagan. Don't disappoint me... Jenny. Patron... A brandy. That's for you. - Oh! I'll pay at lunch. - Alright. Come on, Rimoldi, have to go. 12.30 already? It's 2 minutes to 9. You wouldn't believe what happened to me. What? Tell me! Well... I'll explain later. You mustn't be late on your first day as auditor. Thank you, lad. This is yours. There's a mistake. I'll be wearing a white fur hat.. Paris payment. "Bonjour Tristesse" by Francoise Sagan. Securities opposite, ma'am. Tell me, when are these securities due? I'll check. Excuse me, ma'am. By chance, your name wouldn't be Jenny, would it? No, my name's Cecile. "Cecile"? So much the better... Cecile is such a nice name. - Next June, ma'am. - Thank you. This Jenny is an angel. Such a wonderful letter. It may be too good to be true, and yet... And yet... Maybe the fellows at the bank are watching me. Yes? No, can't see anyone. Nobody. If it was true... 12.15. Should I go now? No, I won't go. I know them, it's just a joke. Those damned workmates... at it again. People like that... - Bastards! - What was that? - Nothing. - Just as well! How pretty she is! Where are the bridesmaids? Exceptional jackpot! Grab your chance! Sir, don't pass up a chance at happiness! You are quite right, ma'am! You gotta be in it to win it. Just a 10th share? No, I'm not crazy. It can only happen to me. It must have fallen out of her book! So she came. Excuse me, ma'am... You wouldn't have seen on that bench... ...a young woman with a white fur hat? - I was to meet her. - Can you describe her? No. I can't. I don't know her. What a shameful excuse to chat me up! And a mother with children! I assure you, I don't know... Goodbye, ma'am. One more. I told you he'd go. I won my bet. Unlucky in love, Rimoldi? Your date stand you up? A letter? So the letter was another of your jokes. How dare you?! What do you think you're doing?! No, Rimoldi! Too much! Too much? Who's next? Wow! I told you lot that I'd have the last laugh. Jenny? I waited for you. It's impossible... it wasn't true. "Wasn't true"? You'd never understand... Me neither. Logically, I must be crazy. But if I'm crazy, I disregard logic. Fortunately, there are crazy people to give you hope. Oh, Jenny... So it hasn't knocked the goodness out of you? I just become resigned. Same as me. We're the same, that way. It's funny... I feel I'm living a dream. But everything is so simple... so illuminated. Yes you're here, and you light up everything. And then, you're so young, while I am... You're wonderful. Only goodness and purity are worthy of love. Jenny, I want to say things I've never said before. Things I'm discovering, without shame... ...and without fear of ridicule. Wonderful... She is wonderful. Now I understand, Mr Leclerc... That letter was not a joke. It was lucky you believed in it. Yes, I know. My colleagues won't laugh at me anymore. Because if I'm an idiot, at least I'm a happy one. Your happiness fills me with joy. Mr Leclerc, my friend Bertrand... ...told me everything, at the cafe. Martel... He steams open the envelope with the coffee machine... He reads the letter, puts it back, and you can guess the rest. All is explained. Indeed, everything's explained. Yeah. - Tell me, Rimoldi. - Yes? The fact that you've found love is great. But it should be something that's between you and Jenny. Right? Of course. What's this "28" about? Ah, "28"... The 28th was the day we met. So I put it there... It was a mistake. 28 million... But do you understand...? Of course... I'm someone who's easily distracted. - I'm a good-for-nothing. - Not at all! You realise that I'm not the sort who can live locked up. No. I need movement, I need open air... I need room to breathe! Walking would be the best thing for you. You're not going to pay me to do that? Yes. Well I never! Bouchard... He died? No, he's asked for leave. He's worn out. You could replace him temporarily as our security man? Security? Well what do you know! I need someone trustworthy. I couldn?t do better than you. Then I can't refuse you. I'm your man. Fine. I'll organise your gun permit. What?! Headquarters: 2 million new francs in two bags. 1st bag: 1 million new francs. Today? 200 million old francs? Excuse me! Its not for you. You won't get rich. No, but 200 million sounds impressive. So, on your feet all day! It's more fun than the office. And how about this?! Rimoldi... Telephone. - Phone for me? - Yes. - Excuse me. Sir. - Make it quick. Don't delay. Yes, this is Rimoldi. What? Jenny? An accident? Run over by a... Where is she? 23 Tilleuls Avenue? I'm coming now. - Mr Leclerc, something's happened... - Tonight. - No, it's terrible. - Get going. - I have to explain! - Tonight. Road-hog! Murderer! No, I've never had an accident. No, someone ran into my fiancee. You're getting married? Yes. If she hasn't been killed. 23 Tilleuls Avenue... You can't refuse me to stop there. Any change of route is forbidden. Bertrand, she's dying. You've always been decent to me. You can't give me this grief. Rimoldi, it's the regulation. - Otherwise I'll jump now. - Bet you don?t! Bet I do! Don't be stupid! You can't let Jenny die without her seeing me! Alright... It'll have to be real quick. You'll be the godfather of the firstborn! Thanks! Who are you? - Where is she? - Excuse me? - Is she still alive? - Certainly... What?! - This is 23 Tilleuls Avenue? - Yes. A young girl was brought in here... ...injured, run down by a car? By a car? Run down? Should I ring the police or the asylum? I can see this was just another joke. That's shocking, Sir! You wouldn't understand. My workmates at the bank have pulled another stunt on me. I've been made to come here with a van carrying 200 million. A van is it?! A van with 200 million? 200 million what? Kicks in the behind? Caesar! Show this gentleman out! No, please don't bother him! Down boy! It's a holdup! Help! The police found me stunned in the ditch. The doors of the van open. The bags stolen. Yes, I have the police report. You were taken to Elbeuf Hospital. Let's get back to the attack. Rimoldi saw what was loaded and knew the importance of it. Of course... I was right there. - You'd have to have been blind... - Just be quiet, Rimoldi! Once the load was known, you've called your accomplices. My fiancee had just been run over, that's all. We'll come back to this mysterious fiancee. But in talking with other employees... ...your "fiancee", it was agreed, was just a covering codeword. "A codeword"? Sign your testimony. Read and signed as final. You can leave now. 'Bye, Rimoldi. See you, Bertrand. I'm still glad I only shot in the air. Still sticking to your "tender-hearted" story... ...rather than not shooting at the van... ...in case you wounded an accomplice. That's not going to work! You were working as part of an organised gang. "An organised gang"? Me? With me always being alone? Over to you, Mr Levasseur. I'd like a word, Mr Rimoldi. Someone who addresses me as "Mr"! That's a change. Tell me, Mr Rimoldi... ..don't you know where those millions are? Nor where my fiancee is. And that's all that matters to me. - As for the rest... - "The rest"?! Insignificant! 200 million... a trifle! Excuse me, Judge... Who is this person? He represents the insurance company who will repay the money. He's entitled to be here. You're to answer his questions as though they were mine. Very well, Judge. Mr Rimoldi, you were talking of your fiancee. Does this Jenny truly exist? Not some phantom of your imagination? "Phantom"? Kissing one wouldn't have the same effect... I think. She hasn't hurried to defend you. Her testimony could've cleared you. She might come. She doesn't know. She never reads the papers. Have you ever had hallucinations? - Hallucinations? - Yes. Have you ever believed in certain things... ...that didn't exist? I sure have! Such as? That innocent people never go to prison. If he's not an idiot, he gives a good impersonation... ...unless he's mentally ill. I'm quite normal, and I won't allow you... Of course you're normal! You love a woman who doesn't exist... ...and you divert a security van to save her. So you're quite normal! That'll surely be the conclusion of the psychiatrists. Are you going to lock me up? No, it's just an assessment. Please summon Dr Jousseaume. So, Doctor... what's your assessment? It was a free ranging conversation, very friendly... ...with this brave boy. He's a man of feeling! A fine type of person! I appreciate your homage to this individual. We don't have the same moral criteria. Allow me, Inspector... Tell me, Doctor, about our Rimoldi... Crook or imbecile? Imbecile, probably. But wait... - You think so? - Yes, but... With a lot of common sense and straightforward judgment... He has an inherent ignorance of evil. He can neither imagine it, nor accept it. Thus, this Jenny, who would have been able to clear him... Does this Jenny exist? Well, how can I best put it... Maybe yes. Maybe no. But as far as he's concerned, she really does exist. Doctor, do you believe he's guilty? My dear sir... A question like that can never concern a doctor in any way. However, I could not for a moment see that fine young man... ...running a gang or organising a heist. Do you think he's really responsible for his actions? That's the essence of it. My friend... to decide if a man is responsible for his actions... ...requires investigation and assistance by other experts. Always happy to be of service. Goodbye, Judge and thank you. In spite of your science, madmen roam the streets. Like with murderers, despite your efficiency, Inspector. So gentlemen, we're getting somewhere? May I make a suggestion? Most certainly. The main thing is to get the money back. And those responsible! One doesn't happen without the other. Why not release him? There you go! An armed holdup is a serious crime. You have him followed. If he's one of them, he's going to lead you to his accomplices. There's the chance he'll run. But you recall the Dumas case, Judge. We did that, and it was a success. That's true. But if he escapes you? Give me credit for knowing my trade, Judge. It's true, I don?t catch them all, but when I have one... I'm telling you, the answer's no! An old tenant like me?! It's no use asking... This is a respectable establishment. One not suitable for honest people, is it? Hello, Mr Mercier. How are you and the family? "Mr Mercier"? Oh, Mr Rimoldi! You're back! At least you kids understand me. - You haven't been too sad? - Well... Champion of the security-van heist! Robert, Michel, get upstairs! The rest of you get home to your parents! Where did you stash the loot? Robert! That's what you've done to them, with your mistrust. At least I haven't turned them into thieves. There we are Mrs Brun. Well, Sir? Well, think about it, old chap... You can imagine the reaction, if I were to take you back here. Exactly. An innocent man who comes out of prison doesn't inspire confidence. Come off it! Goodbye, Sir. - Rimoldi... - Sir? Go out the back way. The tradesman's entrance? I suppose it's better. I feel strange, sneaking out like a thief. One day you'll be back with your head held high. - If you're short of cash... - No... no need. - I do have some savings. - Savings? I can assure you it's not 200 million. I still have enough to live on for a while. I hope I'll find work... ...LO eat. You could always... I could always what? I mean you could always give some information to the police... ...and things might work out for you. No, I mean you could always... In the situation where I'll always be an honest man... ...what would you suggest I do, Sir? Come back and see me... ...when your innocence has been recognised. In the meantime... ...try to make yourself forget a little. Make myself forget? You're right. Me too... I want to forget. You're crazy! - Let me go! - Come on! What's it to do with you? Want to sell me life insurance? - What did you want to prove? - That I'm fed up with it. - Is killing yourself a solution? - Yes. I don't really know if I would've jumped. I probably hoped to be stopped. I'm torn between blaming you... ...and thanking you. You'll be thanking me, when you think about it clearly. Give me a moment of your time. Having saved me, I can certainly give you that. Come on then, old chap. Do you really truly believe me innocent? Yes. You've got some nerve! A guy doesn't try to kill himself... ...when he has 200 million to play with. The rest of them don't think like you. - The world thinks I'm guilty. - Don't be an egoist. What about the phantom "Jenny"? - Jenny? - Yes. - Let's not talk about phantoms. - As you wish. You don't ask yourself where she is? I'd rather not think about it anymore. Because you think she may have been part of the gang. Yes, I have thought that... and it's horrible. Another explanation... The gang hold Jenny to stop her from saving you... Even harming her. Don't say that. That idea is worth exploring. You'd have to fight to avenge Jenny... maybe even save her. Me fight..? I need to pull myself together. No one would want to, more than me. I'll be happy if it turns out you don't need to. I'm getting back my taste for life. Rimoldi, old chap... here's to your good health! It's improving rapidly! To yours! Dinner will be ready soon. Your room OK for you, Mr Rimoldi? Is it OK? I'll say it is! It's simply too lovely. My brother and I couldn't leave you homeless. You're to feel at home here. But really... I'm starting to think I must be dreaming. It's the second time. You've suffered too much injustice. You're entitled to revenge. So do you believe in my innocence, too? Of course I do. My brother told me about it. God, what a lovely couple you are. I'm neither a saint nor a philanthropist. I have my own interest in this story. My company's offering a 10 percent reward for the return of the money. 20 million? Quite a sum! I'm asking you to help me. What should I do? Play at being an idiot. That won't be hard for me. Harder than you think. Not for me. Rimoldi, you'll have to spend all day walking around town. That's fine... I really enjoy walking. We have to get the thieves worried about your release. They won't give themselves up... ...but they should think you may be proving your innocence. My word! Their goal will be to remove you at the first opportunity. - Really? - Yes. But this action, Rimoldi... ...is something we need to encourage. Encourage? Am I to understand that you now want to have me killed... ...having just saved my life? I hope Mr Rimoldi won't be exposed to any risk. Oh no... I'd be intervening, together with the police. Hopefully just in time. I can assure you of that. You know, Rimoldi... ...there's something else I'd like to say. Yes? The reward... It's not so much for me. It's for this little chap. - What a cute kid. - Yes. - What's his name? - Pierre. He lives with his grandmother. Is he your son? No. He's mine. Yes, it's a painful story. My sister may tell you one day. Because she's suffered too? Thanks. Your lodger not up yet? After all he's been through, he deserves to sleep in. No time to lose, all the same. Today, tomorrow and every day until further notice... ...you'll shadow Rimoldi from when he leaves Levasseur's home. You'll take turns in trailing him... ...to protect him if he runs into trouble... ...and above all to nab those responsible for the holdup... ...when they show themselves. Go to it. Good morning, Ma'am... Could I see the little rabbit? So...? The old market, rue Jeanne-d'Arc, St-Maclou, government house, the wharves. - What a walker! - Have a seat. - He deserves it. - Where is he now? In a toy shop. - What if he's giving us the runaround...? - Patience! OK. Tell Renaud to take over. Sure, chief. Your turn. Dry white. Excuse me... I'd like a frame. Several days now... and no result from your shadowing. - Well, you know... - It's here in your report. During our surveillance, we have seen Albert Rimoldi... ...present himself successively at 3 framers... Donnadieu, rue Damiette, Boisse, rue de la Vicomt?e... Javelin, rue Malpalu, and buy a frame at the last one. For his portrait? It's not serious. I'll have to lock him up again... ...and continue with my investigation. Rimoldi is a decent fellow. Oh, of course he is! If one was to believe the accused and their lawyers... ...this office would only have ever seen decent fellows. But the courts have decided otherwise. Go and arrest him for me. I know that he's innocent. That's your personal opinion. My opinion is favourable to him as well. But that's not enough. I can only base my investigation on proofs... ...either negative or positive. Or on strong corroborating evidence. He's staying with Mr Levasseur. He has somewhere to live. I see what you're getting at. There are certain things that the law requires before justifying a bail-type situation. We can always catch him again. Following him brought up nothing. I scrapped it. Besides, if Mr Levasseur took him in out of pity... His interests have to be considered. He's quietly controlling our fine fellow of an idiot. As for me, I'm directing my officers to take a different tack. A new clue? An idea that I have. Indications. I was about to discuss them with you. Oh, Albert... You're too kind. Such feeling... You can't imagine the pleasure you've given. I feel the same about you, I assure you. That was just a trifle. Despite how I'm living now, I have scruples. - "Scruples"? - I'm just a parasite. Be quiet! Despite their motivation, no one's tried to kill me. It's hopeless! It's embarrassing. Your brother has trusted me. It'll happen. The later the better. Sorry! The thing is, I'm enjoying this life as much as the old one. Yes, because... I'm really starting... ...to enjoy a family life. You see, Albert, when someone has suffered... ...they better appreciate the sufferings of others. That's very true. It's not surprising that you should be an artist. You have such sensitivity. If you were to leave, the house would feel empty. Thank you, Edith. Thank you. That's pretty, what you're painting there. You've even managed to give perfume to the flowers. How awful! I'm just so clumsy! You know... I know I'm an idiot, but this time, I truly am. Are you new to this area? Oh no! Certainly. Look..! - A farm-chicken at this price... - Jenny! Is this you?! - Please let me go! - No, no! You have to explain. You wouldn't understand. You're too innocent. Too stupid! Jenny! You have to understand... My life is at risk! I'm watched... threatened. Who by? A name! His name! Martel. Martel? Martel, that thug! At the cafe, I should've smashed his face in! Where does the bastard live? 14, rue Du PARC. With me. With you? Yes... I understand. You'll have to get rid of him. There's only one way you can save yourself. Give the police the whole story. But then, I'll have to say goodbye to you. Why? Do you really think the police would let me go? True. I hadn't thought of that. It needs thinking about. Promise to see me again. I'll ask one of my friends who works with the police, what you'll be risking. When I see you again, you can decide what to do. Very well. 9 O'clock tonight. On that same park bench. Jenny... Let me go now. See you tonight. I'm really hungry! Nothing healthier than walking. All this walking, yet... ...no one trying to kill me. It's hopeless. Hopelessness hasn't affected your appetite. No, it hasn't. As I walked along, I thought to myself... If I were to run into Jenny... ...just what should I do? Take her by the arm and march her to the police station. However, the girl is also a victim. Listen, Rimoldi... She could have cleared you... and she didn't come forward. Would it not cost her dearly, if she came forward now? Probably. Some months in prison? Some months? Some years! Some years? However... A supposition... I'm just supposing, right? ...that Jenny could tell the whole truth... ...about the holdup, the hidden money, everything. Would that be taken into account? Yes, of course. Would she be acquitted? You don't give up! She might get 5 years instead of 10. - 5 years? - Yes. That too much? But she's a victim! She'll surely become one, if you don't find her. So keep walking... a lot of walking. And if you happen to bump into her... The police. Alright. Straight to the police. That is, if I should meet her. You still love her, Albert. I love her? Let's say I haven't forgotten that I did love her. More than you realise, I feel sure. More than you realise. Dwelling on the past never saved anyone. What counts is action. But I'm not giving up. Starting tonight, I'll cries-cross the city. We can hope for a bad encounter! Thank you. I have to go to the port now, about an oil tanker's damage. The damage isn't serious, but the vessel's Greek, so... That's good, your defending Jenny. You act nobly... That's rare. - It's just how I am. - I know. You are what you are, and you're prepared to take risks. Be sensible. Don't forget you're part of our family now. You say the nicest things, Edith. Cheers! It's better to do chores in the evening. Tomorrow I can decide on my bet for the week. Too bad if we disturb anyone making love. Look...! I bet some kid's lost her skipping rope. And tomorrow morning, she'll come back looking for it. Call the police. - Did you make the call? - Yes. - You haven't touched anything? - No. We just stayed with the body... Out of the way! Distance of the body from the bench... Let the doctor through. - Who is it? - Courage, old chap. - Who is it? - Jenny... She's...? Murdered. Jenny! Get in the van... We'll get your statement. Jenny! Let me go! If I hadn't been following you, you would've been accused of the crime. - Me? - Yes. You should've told me everything at dinner. We would've saved her. Not the hospital... the morgue. Poor girl. They stopped her from talking. You have to face facts... This is now a murder case. Go back to my place, Edith will help you. I'll go see the police. Most of all... stay calm. 32, rue Corneille. Driver, change of address... 4, rue Du PARC. Very well, Sir. Get in there! Well, well...! It's Rimoldi! You didn't know I was out of prison? Yes. But I was surprised that you hadn't dropped by... ...to say good day. So here I am. I've dropped by... to say good evening. At such a time? You really are a weirdo. A monster calls me a weirdo? Now I've heard everything. "A monster"? What are you talking about? A piece of shit! The holdup wasn't enough for you. So Jenny... ...had to be killed to shut her up! Jenny's dead?! So... - Murderer! - It's not me. I just went along with Bertrand! Bertrand was in on the heist?! And we haven't touched anything yet. Drop it! He just can't take a punch. The murderers. Police headquarters... 14, rue Du PARC? Yes, right away. 14, rue Du PARC. An attack. You go. Sure. Dead... I want to know where it comes from. Block the doorway. 11.30. You... at last! I'm sorry. I left the taxi... I wanted to walk. All this time? I got tired of walking and went into a cinema. The Capitol... That was it. The Capitol. A cinema? After Jenny's death? I didn't know what I was doing. It was all so awful. "A Taxi for Tobruk." was showing. That's neither here nor there. Don't you know that crime is a daily reality? No, I didn't know that. You go and rest. I think I need to. Goodnight. Rimoldi? Yes? Do you promise not to hide anything from me from now on? Your life may depend on it. My life? Want to talk about my life?! If you only knew! See you in the morning. Well, Rimoldi... Leaving without saying goodbye to your friends? Where are your manners?! So ungrateful! Don't be hard on him! Sometimes we can't face a gut-wrenching drama. Thank you, Edith. So long as he's not worried that he'll be accused of killing Martel... ...Jenny's lover. Where were you last night between 11 and midnight? Last night I was at the cinema. At the Capitol. "A Taxi for Tobruk" was on. Yes, a nice movie! Yes. Very, very moving. - You've seen it, too? - Yes. But not last night. Last night the Capitol was closed... ...for a Youth Sports meeting. But I... Well I would have got a glimpse... Don't give me any more cinema. Just tell me everything. Yes, I was at Martel's last night. I was sure he'd killed Jenny. I wanted to beat a confession out of him. And what did he confess? That he'd done the holdup with Bertrand, the driver. The driver of the security van? How about that! We're getting somewhere! Exactly. You should be thanking me... ...instead of accusing me. I'm convinced that's true. Oh yeah? You say that, even though he was at Martel's when he was murdered? Especially the mysterious call. Would Rimoldi have summoned you to the scene of his crime? I know who it was... The killer wanted the police to find me near the body. He's the one who knocked me out. Albert is lucky that I got this call. You should be seeing about Bertrand, the accomplice. I'll be questioning him. You won't get anything out of him... you have no proof. Whereas, with the help of Rimoldi... ...an unexpected visit... the surprise effect... We can see Bertrand at the bank. He may not be there. But after work, where he lives... Agreed. This evening, at his place. I'll go along with this one more time. But I'm warning you... ...if I find Bertrand with a neck-tie tied too tight... ...it'll be over for this friend of yours. It'll be the last chance to prove yourself, Albert. Thanks to you, it will be less painful for me. I don't like you leaving. You?re the only one who understands me. I really need to go and hug my boy. My brother needs the car, so I take the boat. It's only a short walk to the house. But today I fear I may never see you again. This visit to Bertrand... Who knows what may happen...? I wanted something to remind you of the "big idiot". Have you done something silly? Well, being an idiot... It's nothing much. Besides, it's not for you... it's for your son. Oh, it's adorable! You think he'll like it? He'll so enjoy it! He'll laugh like you. I don't know your little boy, but I love him already. There's nothing more beautiful and comforting as the laugh of a child. - Yes there is. - What? The smile of a true friend. Edith, you're wonderful. Wonderful. You always say the right thing. When I think of the man who left you... what an idiot! But a real idiot. Kiss... kiss...! Make sure he gets it. I promise. I'm staying. I can't leave you. Edith...? I'm just too worried about this meeting tonight. That's wonderful, Edith. With you backing me, I'll be full of courage. Come on. Off you go, Rimoldi. Play the game your way. I don't know about playing games... ...but someone won't be having fun, for sure. 2 MURDERS IN 21 HOURS Come in... I was expecting you. So I see.. The key was in the door. I'm glad to see you look suitably remorseful. Remorseful about what? If you'd rather... "fearful". Do you know what fear is? "Fear"? - Fear of you? - Oh no, not of me. Fear of the strangler. Jenny is dead... Martel as well. I know. What's the connection? Before he died, Martel told me about you. - He did? - He did. It won't be long before you're a goner, too. Now, if you talk to me a bit, and to the police, maybe... Because the strangler... He's shown what he can do. So, my boy... Want to talk? Not with me. You'll be talking with someone else. There's no way you won't listen to that one. And you'll feel very small. And you'll shut up, just like me! You have the phone here? When you're a top guy, in business with the man in question. The chief? The big boss? A big man, anyway. He won't do anything to me... I'm not like the others. He's probably shot through, with the 200 million. I'll call later. Yes, from the police station. So, are you coming? You're going to give me up? You hit the nail on the head. It's alright for you... You're innocent. Anyway, they can't prove anything against me. Apart from what Martel told me about you. And if I talk... You dirty bastard! We just can't leave you! I have his confession. Give me a hand. Go get the inspector... I'll guard him. - Out of the question! - Why? We'll tie him up... He won't get away. We'll go down together to get the police. Here... I used to work in a warehouse... I was tops at tying up packages. No, Rimoldi! How did you get him to confess? When I spoke of Martel... you should've seen his face! The parcel is ready for delivery. He could go back on his word... ...and refuse to repeat his confession to me. I can add more to it than that. But just keep your hands off him this time, Rimoldi! Him too! Cover him up. Don't touch a thing until the doctor's been here. Search the building. Block the exits. Number three! I assure you, Rimoldi is innocent. Bertrand was alive when we left. A bit of luck for your friend here. Because leaving a body behind you every time... I had a narrow escape. Everything starts from scratch. Not quite. If the killer is invisible, he is not silent. There's the telephone. When Bertrand spoke, I picked up the number. Are you Sherlock Holmes? If you were Maigret, I wouldn't need to be! Calm down... dial the number. Here. 322... 411. What's wrong, Rimoldi? - What is it? - It's impossible. What? I'm sure I recognise the voice. It's Mr Leclerc. You're crazy! I know that voice! I heard it for 20 years! Leclerc... Leclerc... Leclerc... Leclerc, Henri... Bank Manager... 322 411. Well that's it. But Rimoldi, his employee, didn't know his number? To dare telephone the boss at home? Nobody in the bank except the assistant manager. Rimoldi has mistakenly seen the number dialed by Bertrand. I refuse to believe that Leclerc could be an assassin. Me too. But it was definitely him. Albert should call him back, tell him about Bertrand's death. Leclerc? You sure about that? You will get me into trouble. It's not you, it's Rimoldi. So what do I do? Come on. Tell him that Bertrand spoke to you before he died. Mr Leclerc... Yes? Yes. Dead? Strangled? Yes, and 10 minutes before, he told me extraordinary things about you. Yes, Mr Leclerc. Incredible things. Have you told anyone else about these things? No. That's good. Would you like to see me to talk about it? Yes. No, not at my place. No. I've got people here. 45 minutes... at the bank. Yes. I'll be working there alone, as is usual, of an evening. We won't be disturbed. The door will be left open. See you then, Albert old chap. There we are... How did he react about Bertrand? Didn't react at all. It makes me wonder if Rimoldi hadn't told him about Bertrand before. It makes sense to you... a gang leader named Leclerc? And a murderer named Rimoldi, makes sense to you? - Don't start again! - This is serious. Yes, it's obvious. The last of my illusions is collapsing. Illusions are made like that. It's the way it is. After little Jenny with the face of an angel... ...why not Mr Leclerc, the icon of respectability? Now, nothing would surprise me. The murderer, perchance... wouldn?t be you? One more word, and I'll have you locked up for contempt of court! Not right away. I still have things to tell you. Yes. After the illusions are shattered... ...the reflexions start. Perhaps Mr Leclerc also has desires, dreams, ambitions. All his life he's watched millions and millions flowing through his fingers. For 40 years... 40 years... And now, at the time of retirement... ...smothered by limitations. Then temptation passes by! - He's put you through hell. - I know. And it hurts me. But it's in front of me, like a brick wall. He must have thought about such a heist, for a long time. He was waiting for the opportunity. When suddenly he perceived how unhappy I was alone... ...and would so like to be married. So he carefully plans it with Martel... ...and the complicity of Jenny. After that, he has me replace the sick security man... I leave with Bertrand... ...and there's the holdup. I don't want to sound like I'm telling you how to do your job... ...but that seems plausible, doesn't it? Why kill his accomplices? To keep the loot all to himself. Martel told me they still hadn't shared it out. We need to act. Mr Leclerc has to give us some answers. Yeah... Mr Leclerc... My benefactor. That good man... Mr Leclerc. - He's working late. - He's conscientious! In you go, old chap. So, you imbecile... See where your curiosity has led you? You playing games with me too? Hardly the right time. Do I look like I'm playing games? That's what money can do to a good man. Don't preach to ME! I was just feeling sorry for you... needing a revolver. Sit down. Can we talk about Bertrand? What did he tell you? A lot of things. He told me you'd organised the whole thing. - A nice balance of end of the year. - Which is not finished. Crazy fool. Not only am I not crazy... ...but I've been a most sensible and reasonable man... ...able to inspire confidence in those around me... ...and to pull off a great coup, in my lifetime. Just the one... but a masterful one... ...that I've been thinking about for 20 years... ...to guarantee peace of mind in my old age. When you lifted me out of my wretched life... ...I was being made into part of the plot. Half to be charitable... Half as part of the plan. And you've killed them all? No. But maybe you'll enlighten me. Me? I've never killed anyone. I'm sorry, but I doubt it. Tell me what you know. I've nothing to say! Well, I have something to do! There we are. Legal defense, Albert. You phoned me because you needed money. I say you can see me at the bank tonight. The moment I open the safe to give you some cash... ...you grab hold of me. Who will doubt the word of the honorable Mr Leclerc? Oh, nobody. Nobody... ...at all. You bastard. My God...! I'm a goner this time. Now four! It's all very clear this time, Rimoldi. Rimoldi! Rimoldi! Stop! Order for the arrest of Albert Rimoldi... This man is dangerous. In the case of resistance all police are authorised... ...to use firearms. Description of Albert Rimoldi... Height... 1.78... So there goes the man to slaughter! - You shot at him. - I know, yes. But I was indignant, disgusted. How could I have been so wrong about it? Come on, just don't dwell on it. You should get a change of air. Yes, I'll take my sister out to the country tomorrow. Not with that glum look. No one's blaming you for anything. You've looked at things differently. I did what I could. No, that's not the point... It's just that... I'm thinking how upset Edith will be. Well? My poor Edith... It's hopeless. Mrs Levasseur? That's right. I'm a friend of your children. My name's Albert Rimoldi. Oh, Mr Rimoldi! My children have told me a lot about you. Please come in. Is Edith here? No, she phoned yesterday. She's arriving at midday with her brother. Have you had breakfast? No. I'll make you a cup of coffee. Mrs Levasseur... Before that, I'd like to ask you something. Yes, what's that? Could I see little Pierre? Phone for you, Inspector. It's about Rimoldi. What? How? Good heavens! Go ahead. Mum! That's funny... She always comes out when we arrive. Don't worry about her... You!? She's in her room. What are you doing here? I'd nowhere to go... I thought I'd be safe here... ...with the only friends I have. That's fine. I had a look around the house... I was looking for little Pierre, and I couldn't find him. But in an old suitcase, in the attic... ...I found the 200 million. What did you do with it? It's here. Nothing missing? No, nothing. Not even the letter from the photographer who visited the local orphanages... ...to get this photo... ..of little Pierre... ...who only exists in this print... ...and in your imagination. Edith... I could've overlooked a lot of things... ...but about little Pierre... No. That would've hurt too much. - But... - But what? I could have run away with the millions... but no. Why? Because I wanted to give you the news myself. That was a bad idea, Rimoldi. I can't spare the only one who knows the truth. The truth? Millions and millions paid by shipowners... ...and that insurance companies never saw coming. Why? To cover the deficiencies caused by your gambling debts. I've talked with your poor old mum. Even your dowry was gambled away. That's none of your business. So, Levasseur, you only had one solution... You hook up with Leclerc in his monstrous plan. I'm also aware of that. You're aware of too much, Rimoldi. Obviously. Overcoming a murderer found in my house... ...while using legal defense. Yes... The same refrain as Leclerc's. Who could ever blame... ...the honourable Mr Levasseur? No one. - Not in front of me! - Go outside. Stay, Edith. After so much courage with your crimes... ...show some still for the last one. I don't care what happens. I'm just upset that finishing me off... ...is all you can manage. Doesn't the condemned man at least get a glass of rum? Then don't let me die before giving me certain details. - Do that. - Why, Edith? You want to gain time, and sway me. Out of the question. - You know who I am? - Yes. One of the elite of crime. Top class. Yesterday, if you hadn't missed me on the stairs of the bank... ...you would have committed 5 perfect crimes. Just let me use a momentary reprieve. With Jenny... well, I understand. You found out about our meeting. You went out ahead of me... You followed her in the dark... ...and killed her. With Martel, you followed my taxi. You got into his apartment by the kitchen window... You knocked me out and eliminated the second accomplice. But... Bertrand? Leclerc? You, who are so smart... ...take pity on a poor idiot. What about... Leclerc? The inspector wasted time posting his men. I knew the building. I had time to finish that old scoundrel. Really? What about Bertrand? You came down with me... and on going back... So who? Me. My brother was lost... He would have gone to prison. Edith the Brave! Such family spirit! Well, now it's all clear. I leave happy. Do your worst. No! I forgot to tell you, I removed the magazine. You have to be careful with imbeciles. Fell into the trap, my poor Levasseur. The confessions are complete. They'll be spending the night at headquarters. They'll be formally charged in the morning. Well, Rimoldi... You're completely innocent. You'll get the 20 million reward. Finished well, eh? Not at all for me. I suffered too much from dreams and hopes that were destroyed. Life owes me revenge. What are you going to do? Excuse me, isn't that little boy's name Pierre? No. Lucien. Doesn't matter. He's the most isolated of our orphans. No family at all. He's all alone in the world. Alone? Him?! He won't be any longer. Neither will I. If I may...? Lucien? Come here. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
