- Sebas, give me the marble! - No! - Give it to me! - There are more. - Stop! Give them to me! - Leave me alone. - Give it to me, it's mine! - Like fun it's yours! Mom, tell Sebas to give it back to me! Are you an idiot? Let's go. You know Mom doesn't like us stopping at the old lady's place. Julian! Let's go. What are you doing? It went inside. Hello? Lady, I'm coming inside. I'm here for my marble. Lady, will you give me back my marble? Sebas! Sebas! Run! Some are born, others will die. Sorrows and glories, wars and peace. Always something to live for, to fight for. Always someone to suffer for and someone to love. In the end, the works remain and the people go. Others come who carry on. Life goes on... the same. 4 YEARS LATER - Are we there? - Come on. - Is it here? - There it is. It's so big! All this is our place? Not all of It. It's that one there. See? The 3rd floor. Beautiful. We're going to live like kings. The Madrid sky all to ourselves. The Olmedos? Here at last. - Esteban Ocana, the realtor. - But I spoke to Felipe. Yes, my boss. It's no problem, I'm up to date. Fine... Manuel Olmedo Fernandez. My wife, Candela. - Delighted. - Nice to meet you. - Shall we? - Yes, of course. The concierge Is on leave, but he'll be back next week. The paperwork's underway to get the lift installed. - It's just a few stairs. - The 3rd floor? It'll be hard for my father to get up here. You heard Mr. Ocana, we'll have a lift soon. That's precisely why it's so much cheaper for you, a flat with all these comforts. You've made a great investment, believe me. Well, the flat's not ours, it's the bank's. And even selling all we have, we had to get a mortgage. What about being so close to work? She has a letter of recommendation for a job in Galerias. That's great. And what do you do? I've always worked on the land, but tomorrow I start work at the Pegaso truck factory. Here is it, 3B. Well... go right in. - What's that? - It's... from Mateo. Didn't read it. Grandad, what are you doing there? The living room. It's so hot. Yes, the summers linger until September here. You'll get used to it. As you see, it's just as the prior owner left it. - What happened? - She passed away. - Shall we continueâ - Sure. - Large windows. - Look, like in the village. But the view is better. Whatâ? Don't tell me you don't like the place. - How long has it been closed up? - Four years, I think. That's what they told me when I came to see It. Look, we've got a record player. - Manolo, don't do that. - Why? It's bad luck. Why do we want such a big place? Candela, what's in the village? - Nothing. - Nothing. We're in Madrid. Madrid is the future. We're giving the kids a chance. And us too, we sure need It. Come on, you'll see, we'll be so happy here. If I were queen of the light of day, of the wind and the sea... Sorry, but I have to go. I hope you enjoy it. Welcome to your home. What did I tell you, Rafael? Not inside the house. Why are you putting that there? So that good things happen to us. It won't be like in the village? - No, from now on it'll all be better. - Will someone help me? Go on, go to your sister. - I'll help you. - No, not you, Rafita. Which is my room? Down the end. Rafita! - Mom, I scared Amparo! - That boy... Watch your feet there. Further down, to the living room. There, next to the table. Look out. Look out, look out! - Sorry. - That's how you fix everything. - Amparo, come here. - Take your things to your room. - Candela. - What? - Where do I leave this? - Wherever you like. TREATISE ON PHONETICS - Like it? - Why do I have to sleep with Grandpa? - Because that's the way it Is. - Can't I sleep with Amparo? Your sister's all grown up. Amparo, what are you doing? You know your father doesn't like closed doors. He's not my father. It's my room, isn't it? Sure, but the room's In this flat. I know, you don't need to remind me. You can leave the door open when you go out. - Are you throwing it all out? - Yes. If you want something... I'm not wearing it, it's horrible. That's nice. Although green... I'm not so sure. Anything else? Yes, can you give Rafita a bath? - Now? - Now. I'm going to make dinner. And as of tomorrow, you look after your brother while we're working. - Candela, come and mind this boy. - Coming. Will you keep stillâ? Are we going to stay here long? I guess. I liked the house In the village more. Can we play again? Again? Pretty please... Wouldn't you rather play with Grandpa? - "...with my little eye..." - "...something...". "Beginning..." "With... C". What could it be? What could it be? - Comb! - No. Corner. - Curtain. - You'll never guess it. Come on, tell me what it is. Calais. - What's "Calais"? - A place that doesn't smell poor. That doesn't count. It has to be something you see. - Stay here a moment. - Okay. Grandpa, what are you doing? Rafa?â Rafa, open the door. Rafael, stop fooling around, dinner will get cold. Rafa, what are you doing? Why won't you open up? Rafa, what are you doing? - Mom, there's someone In there! - What are those voices? Rafael's inside! He locked the door, I can't open it! - Rafa! Rafa! - Out of the way! - How could you leave the boy alone? - He could've killed himself! - Where's your head, Amparo? - I saw someone, I swear. What did I tell you? No closed doors! No more nonsense in my home, you hear me?! "Bless us, Lord, and the food we are about to receive..." Enjoy your meal. Pass me the oil, Pepe. - Dad, eat. - Rafita, eat your spuds. Eat up. What's wrong, Amparo? I don't know, I... I think I'm queasy from the trip. I'm going to bed. - What's wrong, honey? - It scares me. Grandpa isn't well, he needs a machine to sleep. Like the scampi back home. Shut your eyes. That's it, good. Imagine they're singing to you. Better? Good night, sweetie. Good night, Mom. Rafa, what are you doing? It's magic. The bill will be magic unless you turn that off. Turn it off, we're going to sleep. Look, Manolo, that's line 25. Here we all help out. Smoke break every two hours. If you need a bathroom break, get someone to cover you. Any questions, just ask me, alright? - Yes, of course. - I'm Miguel. Welcome. Thanks. Welcome. Happy shopping. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks a lot. It's Important to always smile. And to meet the sales quotas. That's very important too. - Oh, and always carry lipstick. - Is that important too? Extremely. Let me... Like this. Pepe... You'll see, you'll find something. This isn't like the village, there's a place for everyone here. Even for us. I didn't... want to leave. What about meâ? Do you think I wanted to leave Mateo? But here we are, we have to cope with it. There's warm milk in the kitchen, if you want breakfast before you go look for work. I'M CLARA I'M PEPE I WAS EXPECTING YOU How many times have I told you not to play with the top here? I'll never learn otherwise. Look, you're ruining the floor. That's it, give me the top. I'm sorry. Shall we have breakfast? That'll do. Have your breakfast. - Want me to give it to you? - I can do it myself. Oh, okay. But eat it all up, eh? PHONE BOOK IBERIA, SPANISH AIRLINES Yes, yes. Yes, what? Rafita. - What are you saying? - You asked me. No, I didn't ask you anything. You asked me. Grandpa? Don't move, you hear me? What? A lot. One balloon, two balloons, three balloons. The Moon's a balloon that got away from me. One balloon, two balloons, three balloons. The Earth's a balloon where / live. One balloon, two balloons, three balloons. The Moon's a balloon that got away from me. One balloon, two balloons, three b... La-la-la, la-la-li, I Am so so happy. La-la-la, la-la-loon, I'm over the Moon. I'm waiting for my grandchildren. I've made them some cookies. What a handsome boy. And so big. What's your name? Aren't you going to tell Granny Berta what your name is? You'll make me very sad. Rafael Olmedo Jimenez. What a lovely name. Tell me, Rafael do you want to... play? Grandpa, for God's sake, where are you going? To the farm. What farm? We have no farm, we sold it. I have to get the shotgun. Your dad will know where it Is. He wouldn't have brought us to this place. He also said he'd be back, and look where we are. Please, let's go inside. She is going to take him. Who? What's that? She is. I spy with my little eye... â. - "Something...?" - Something... "beginning..." With... T. What could it be? What could it be? Tokyo? No. Top. Pepe can put it in his hand. He's going to teach me. And you? Don't you want to... try? They won't let me spin it. But now you're... alone. Amparo. Amparo's not there now. You're alone... with me. I'm going to call a friend to come look after you. She knows lots of games. You've no idea how much she wants to... meet you. Grandpa, stay right there, alrightâ? I've got enough on my plate. Rafael, have you finished breakfast? Rafael? Rafa, come out. Stop playing. Rafa! Rafa! How nice, they left me some cookies. They'll be here soon. I'm so nervous. No, not them. They'll be ages. Here, the gun. It goes off by itself. I'm so nervous... Very well... Anything else to add? My father went outside. He gets disoriented. He's not well. His head, he loses track... - My daughter went out after him. - And left the boy alone? Hello. We checked the whole building: junk rooms, rooftop, den... We asked at the local stores and they know nothing. And that's it? You're not doing anything else? We've notified all of the police stations in Madrid. Stay by the phone, just in case. We don't have a line yet, we Just moved In. We'll come if we have any news. Sir, ma'am, good evening. Manolo, don't you see...? I know, you're right. Come on. - Where are you going? - To find him, I'm not waiting here. - Me too. - I'll come with you. - No, we'll come back regularly. - I'm not staying here panicking. - Can I go? - No, stay with Grandpa. We'll find him. Amparo? Rafael, where are you? Don't leave me alone. We won't, honey, but tell me where you are. I don't know. Okay. What do you see around you? Shh... you'll be heard. - Is someone there? - Yes. A man or a woman? Tell me. I've been seen. Rafael! Mom! Rafael! Rafael, are you there? Rafael! - Help, please! Help! - What's this shouting about? - Amparo, what's wrong? - Rafael! He's in there! Listen! - Rafael? - Impossible, no one lives there. - My daughter says she heard the boy! - Dad, I heard him. He's inside. Out of the way. Rafael, son! Rafael! See? There's nobody, the flat's been vacant for ages. He's here. I think I have a flashlight. Rafa! Rafael, honey! Come out, boy. Rafa. Rafa? Rafa! Are you there? Dad. Oh, my God. Rafa, it's me, Amparo. Rafa, come out, it's alright. Rafa. Doesn't that wall connect to our place? Yes. Amparo! - Amparo! - Amparo! Amparo! Amparo! - Amparo! - Amparo, what's wrong? Amparo, it's me, look at me! Look at me! Look at me! What's wrong? What's wrong? Look at me. What's wrong? What's wrong, Amparoâ. - There's nothing here. - Did you find him? Help me take her home, please. Come here. Come here. Come on. It's alright, it's alright. It's over, It's over. How can we go to work not knowing where the boy is? We've only been at work one day, we can't stay at home. We need the money for the mortgage. We have to go to work. We have no choice. The girl says she's sure she saw him. - Don't start again, please. - She saw him. There was no one there, no one. What she thinks she saw, or imagined... It was nerves or... - I don't know. - But where is he? You said the city would do us good, we'd be great. I can't leave this place without my son. Candela, look at me. You're scared, it's only natural. I'm scared too. But we can't lose our heads or lose hope. We can't. They hurt my heels. I'm sure he's alright. How do you know? Because I'm his father. Hello? Is this Susana? Yes, yes. No, you don't know me. Look, I live in 32 Manuela Malasana, 3B. I wanted to ask if you knew the previous owner. Hello? Susana? Get off the phone, girl. Hello? Excuse me, can I help you? Have you come alone? Have you come alone? Lola, honey. - Excuse me, I don't know what happened. - What's your name? - Me? - Yes. Candela. Forgive my daughter, she gets nervous when I'm not around. She must've seen something in you. If I can help you with anything... Lola wants me to give you this. PRAYER AGAINST ALL EVIL. If you want my workmate to come... Read it to your children. - But... - It will help them. - Everything alright, Mrs. Davalos? - Yes. Do you need us to take it to the dry cleaner? I'll attend to her. Yes, of course. Sorry. YOUR BROTHER IS ALRIGHT HOW DO YOU KNOW? I KNOW WHERE HE IS SEE YOU IN THE BASEMENT Clara? Hello? Clara? Clara. Hello! Grandpa? I am the one who pursues you every night. I am the one who, for loving you, lives no more. The one who waits for you, the one you dream of, the one who'd wish to be the master of your love, of your love. I am the one... Grandpa. Grandpa, it's burning. Amparo. Help me. You have to get me out of here. Help me. Answer the phone, Amparo. Answer it. Rafael? Rafa! Rafa. Shut your eyes. Rafa... Rafa. Are you alright? Manolo! - Manolo! - Yes, here. You have a call, it's about your son. Now I'm listening to your heart. In his state it's normal for him not to speak. He may take some days to do so. I have a grandson his age. You have to watch them like a hawk. Such a long time in darkness has put him in shock. When he recovers his voice, he'll tell you what happened. It's best for him to rest and avoid any upsets. - Very well. - Thanks a lot, doctor. - You're welcome. - This way. Manolo. What? I don't like this house, I don't like Madrid. It's not easy for me either. I could talk to my cousin, he can get you seasonal work. Candela, listen. We're penniless. We put all we had into this place. We can't go back. Come on, rest. - What if God is punishing us? - Here we go again! - We can't even get married. - I don't want to talk about it. Okay? I don't want to, that's that. Amparo. - What are you doing up? - Nothing. - Are you going out? - No. Where would I go? You look nice. Mom. Yes? Nothing. What's wrong? Do you see something? SLUT Candela, the power's out. Jeez, this Is as old as the hills. Amparo. I SPY "With my little eye..." MINE Candela, what's going onâ? Where are you? Amparo. Amparo, what are you doing? Fuck. Mom! Mine. Mine. - Mom! - Manolo, get my father! Amparo! Amparo! Pepe! Pepe! Mine. - Amparo! Amparo! - Mom! Get back! Run! HOLY SPIRIT It's 360 pesetas a night. 390 with bathroom. Can I get your family register? Family register? We don't have it on us. We had to rush out. I can't let you stay unless you show me your family register. I'll pay you for two rooms, but let us all stay together. I want you out tomorrow. "Our Father..." Who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom... come... "Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven." Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, "But deliver us from evil. Amen." Hello? I asked about it. Thanks a lot. We gave them the money and now they have to return it. Things happen in that house. What things? Leaks? Is there vermin? - There's a spir... - We don't mind losing the deposit... Or the payments we've made. I'm sure we can do something, sell the car... A mortgage is forever. That's why you signed a life insurance policy. I advise you to keep paying off your debt without fail, whether you live there or not. Good day. PRAYER AGAINST ALL EVIL. Listen. Listen, damn it... - They fired me. - They fired you? I vanished without an explanation. What else would they do? - Candela, calm down. - How can I calm down? Give me time. I can't think now, but I'll work it out, I swear. I'm not letting my kids in that flat. And what do we do? Sleep in the car, under a bridge? What do we do? Candela, where are you goingâ? Someone will have to provide for this family. Davalos... Davalos... Davalos... Davalos... Davalos... Davalos. What are you doing? I wanted to deliver it to the customer personally. I'd never think of such a thing. You come in late and barely sell anything. At the end of the month you'll have to explain. - Julia... - I'm really trying. I really am, but you're not making it easy for me. I gave your name, I trusted you, even knowing that... Knowing what? I don't know what I expected from someone who sleeps with her brother-in-law while her sister's dying in the next room. Wasn't it enough for you to ruin our life in the village? You have to make it fester for us here too? Stay out of my life. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - How can I help you? - I'm from Galerias. - Leave it with me if you like. May I speak to the lady of the house? She's not in. But I can give it to her. Rosario, who is it? You know Lola, don't you? She can hear you perfectly well. Hello. Why did it take you so long to come? What did she see when we met in Galerias? How could she know? Lola sees things that we don't. The presences need a debilitated mind to communicate, a mind that puts up no barriers. So they can enter her. Some people are in the world for a purpose. That is Lola's purpose. What happened in that flat must've been terrible that the previous tenant refuses to leave. But why? That's what I don't understand. We're not guilty of anything. Why won't she leave us in pease? Lola saw it in you, and still does. Your husband and children already carry this pain in them. What are you telling me? You can leave, sell the flat... It doesn't matter, it's already inside. The pain will follow you until you can ease it. Can you help us? She wants something from your family. Something you have. Pepe, where were you? How can you leave your brother alone with all that's going on? It's what... they gave me... for the metronome. You went back home? It's missing... 12 pesetas for the subway. Hello. Susana Lopez Garcia? You sounded different on the phone. How old are you? - 17. - 17 years old. Holy Mary. Are you alright? No. Come In. Thank you. - Has she done this before? - On occasion. - Where's Amparo? - Wasn't she with you? She said... she was going... to look for you. - We have to wait for your daughter. - Why? - Manolo. - No, Manolo, no. I don't know why the kids have to be here. You can help us, right? Do what you have to do, but alone. That's not how it's done, Mr. Olmedo. Oh, and how is it done? She wants us to go in. Different ones come every day. They keep me company. Thanks for seeing me, I thought after talking on the phone... I don't like telephones. Go in, go in, I won't eat you. Julia will be here with you today, honey. Mom... It's alright, son. Maybe you could tell me who lived in that flat. Why do you want to know? Your number is the only one in the phone book. And on the bills. She always called. But I didn't answer. Who was she? How many are in your family? My mother, my grandfather, - Manolo... - Brothers? A boy? - Rafael. - Age? 5 years old. What did she do to him? She took him, but she gave him back to us. Because a boy is on the way. I can still smell bellies. Didn't you live alone? Come. Holy Christ. My girl. Susana? I think I'm going to go. That's not me. - What's going on?! - Don't touch her. Punishment had no effect on him. My father locked him in the clock. His throat was raw from crying until he pulled him out. But it didn't matter, the next day he did the same. He took my green dress. My father went crazy when he found him on the landing, in high heels, pretending to be pregnant. Good God. One day my father found him with the neighbour in the basement. He beat him almost to death. It was his brother. And you know what he said? That he wasn't Miguel, that we were to call him Clara. I AM CLARA The boy Is ours. Don't hurt them. They're not to blame for your misfortune. You have to go. He didn't realize that he was hurting us. Did he live all his life alone in that place? We couldn't let him out, he was obsessed with being a mother. That's why he took your brother. When he found out you were pregnant, he let him go. Now he wants your child. Imagine what they would've said about us if they saw him like that: dressed up and in makeup. My parents didn't even let him go to the entrance door. When my parents passed away, we divided the flat in two: 3A was mine and 3B was his. I had to leave so as not to hear the neighbours' gossip. Shameful. Since then, I haven't wanted to know about him. He called incessantly until the night he died. Then the phone stopped ringing. Maybe all he needed was a little company. No, he didn't deserve it. Why couldn't he be like other people? How hard could it have been? Because of him, we could never be a family. - You could, but you refused to be. - No! He was a freak! Be sure of one thing. If he didn't get it in life, I assure you he'll keep trying after death "I believe In God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth." I believe In Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, conceived by the power and grace of the Holy Spirit. I believe In the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the flesh - "and the live everlasting. Amen" - No! "I believe on God the Father Almighty..." Rafa. Rafa. Lola! Lola, no! Mom! Rafael! Let go of my brother! Give him to me. No. No. I know what they did to you was awful. You deserved a better life, not all this. I'm sorry, Clara. Give him to me! Mine! You have to go. Dad! - No! - No! Do you have everything? I'll tell you if there's any interested buyer. Don't worry, no one will find out what happened In that place. At least your husband's insurance eliminated the mortgage and you can go back to the village in peace. Send me the sewing machine when you can. - Give it to me. - No, I can do It. - Amparo. - Pepe... That's everything, Mom. You'll be fine ma'am. To the train station, please. You confused a dream for a plan. Welcome to the big city. No one will lend you a hand or even look at you when you go down the drain. Not out of evil cruelty, Just that you seem like no one. So understand that what you have at home is the main thing - and what comes won't be easy. - I'm not afraid of fire. Or insults, what I fear is. Watching a wall... grow... between us. It's all so big, so cold. The monster knows. That divided... he can take us down. Don't stray from me. You don't believe me. I Beg you and you don't believe me. You look at me and don't believe me. It's me, but you don't believe me. Tell me you believe me and it'll all be fine. Tell me you believe me one last time. Tell me you believe me and don't lie to me. Lie to me. Believe me. No one gets away. The end of everything outside, it's all about going home. The city is hostile, but you take it if things at home are good. Nothing scares me. But outside, what terrifies me is what I'll find when I return, because I'll always return. You and me, believe me. You and me against this city, we don't care about the rest. We have to be a home, an oasis of peace. You and me against this city, we don't care about the rest. We have to be a home, an oasis of peace. You don't believe me. I Beg you and you don't believe me. You look at me and don't believe me. It's me, but you don't believe me. Believe me. Tell me you believe me and it'll all be fine. Tell me you believe me one last time. Tell me you believe me and don't lie to me. Lie to me. Believe me. Sorry, it's a mistake, I guess. I Don't think I know you. What? Who are you? Do you want me to call someone? Are you alright? I Don't know what you're saying. Don't shout at me. Calm down. What? 32 Malasana? It doesn't exist. Translation: Lindsay Moxham Subtitles: LASERFILM
