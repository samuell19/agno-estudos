It was a beautiful day. You could feel the heat from the volcano. You could feel that the ground was warm. You kind of get these beautiful yellow colors. Dark, dark oranges as well. I mean, just colors everywhere. Steam popping up out of the ground... It was an absolutely breathtaking sight. It looked like Mars or something. There was a lot more steam than I thought there would be. You knew there was something beautiful and terrible, and you wanted to see it... but our tour guides just said, "Do not go near the edge of the crater." I was getting really anxious. And I talked to our tour guide, and I asked him, "What do we do if there is an eruption, because I'm getting a little nervous here?" I love my wife more than anything but being anxious is not an unusual situation for her so I did just brush it off for the most part. They even said the words, "It's not going to erupt." As a young Kiwi, what better place to grow up? You got the hills, and the hunting and the fishing. And the ocean to swim in. You know, it... it... there's nothing better. Whakatāne is a beautiful community, full of adventure. Geographically, we are on the east coast of the North Island. Auckland's here. And then down the coast is Whakatāne. People would pronounce it "Wock-a-tain" or "Feck-a-tah-nee" or "Wock-a-tah-nee" or whatever. But it's a small community that has a lot of love at the heart of it. There's 38,000 people in Whakatāne. We have uh, 51 percent non-Māori, you know, and 48 percent Māori. And our communities support one another. And together, we have got a beautiful area, which includes the living active, breathing volcano, Whakaari. The English name, "White Island." White Island is about 48 kilometers off the coast of Whakatāne. When you're driving down the coast, you look out across the horizon and you see the large plumes of white smoke coming out of the crater. Absolutely amazing. It's just the raw beauty of nature. In our folklore, we come from the mountains. We actually are descendants of Whakaari. And we are the protectors of the Island itself. She is an awesome energy and power unto her own right. But she's also very special in terms of tourism. People love White Island. And so many people are connected to White Island Tours here. Our restaurants, our motels, everything... our shops, our boutiques... All of those rely on people that adventure tourism brought to our town. Our wedding was the most perfect magical day ever. I don't think I ever smiled that much in my entire life. I'm an adventure seeker. She is absolutely not an adventure seeker. I'm more of a laying-out type of girl, or um... just, relaxing at a beach, or something like that. So for our honeymoon, we started looking at cruises. We found this one for New Zealand and we looked at it. It was like, "Oh this is great! New Zealand has all this amazing geography" and attractions. This seems perfect." My sister and I, we really like anything that's gonna give us a lot of adrenaline, and I suppose, put us at some kind of enjoyable risk. Oh, fuck! Woo! So we jumped off the Auckland Tower. We went black water rafting. My mom and dad had previously been on a few cruises, and they really enjoyed them. And they brought it to us, my sister and I, the idea of going on a cruise to New Zealand. And on that cruise, we were given the options of excursions onto the mainland. I would pick out an excursion one day, and Matt would pick out an excursion for a different day. So December 9th was actually Matt's day to pick out an excursion. I'm into everything science. And it sounded really interesting, like an actual volcano that you can walk up to and look into. White Island was something different that you wouldn't normally be able to do, being one of the world's most active volcanoes. I mean, from the description, it was a nice easy hike. It's not like you need rock climbing gear and everything else to get up there. It was, just walk up to the crater and look in and see this amazing volcano. They made it sound exciting, they didn't make it sound dangerous. And I was like, "Okay, that... it looks good." You know, we looked at the description, and I was like, "Okay." We live in Hamilton in New Zealand, and I'm a full-time pastor at a church. My daughter, she'd been studying through school geology and volcanic activity, and I said to her, "We should go while we have the opportunity to go." And then for my 50th birthday, she'd surprised me with tickets to go out to Whakaari. Monday morning, it's quiet. There's not a lot of traffic around. We arrived at the tour office and we read through a couple of safety documents, and then were asked to sign just our contact details and next of kin details. I know there's a risk and I'm there with my daughter, I'm not going to put her in danger. But at no point did I ever fear what we were actually doing. - Morning! - Morning. That day, there were a few boats that toured the Island, and we were in the Phoenix. We left the wharf, traveled out on the river for five or ten minutes. You cross the river bar heading out into the open ocean... And then from there on to White Island. We departed from the main cruise ship around 9:00a.m. We took an hour-long bus ride to Whakatāne, to the port where we were taking off from, with 40 or so other tourists. We all got onto the Te Puia, and the tour guide said it was a brand new ship. I think they just gotten it that year. There were four guides on the Te Puia. They were locals to Whakatāne, and they were very excited to tell us about the history of White Island. The morning of December 9th, it was Hayden, Tipene, Jake, and myself as guides. We prepped the boat and then we just left like every other day. Closer to shore, we'll take you on a fully guided tour of the inner crater area. And this will take approximately an hour to an hour and a half. My younger brother, Hayden, loved the outdoors and he had a passion for summer. And in 2009, he started as a tour guide, guiding in Whakaari. Hayden kept a detailed diary of every trip that he went to the Island. And he'd done 1,111 trips. That's amazing. I did not know that was Hayden's 1,111th trip to the Island. No. Hayden's probably one of the longest standing guides. He helped train me at work, and then, yeah, after work we'd go to the local fishing club, or we'd take trips up to the Tarawera Falls. He was always up for an adventure. He developed a huge passion for the whole environment. Not just Whakaari, and not just the volcano. The gusts were blowing, the swell was quite large. A lot of the poor passengers actually were being moved to the back of Te Puia cause they were feeling quite seasick. I was sitting with my family, we were kind of... not making fun of them but laughing a little bit, smirking to ourselves. We quite enjoyed being on the water. And we were enjoying the bumpy ride. We had no idea how rough the seas were going to be. We were on that boat for probably 90 minutes. And I would say, at least seven or eight people were vomiting just 'cause the entire ship would pitch up and then it would pitch back down, and you would see ocean then sky, then ocean then sky, then ocean then sky. I was so close to throwing up. I mean, I was literally like, holding my stomach like this. It's an hour and a half out there and an hour and a half back. Some days, you can go out there and it can be rough. It can be horrible. And if you're not used to being on a boat for an hour, your sea legs go pretty quickly. Hence, there was another option as well. You could take a helicopter and that was only a 20-minute flight. Waking up that day for me was a little bit of nerves, a little bit of stress. This is my first day where I was allowed to fly passengers solo. I went to to New Zealand initially for my license. Just looking for a good place to learn to fly. On a clear day, if you're taking off from the mainland, you'd be able to see White Island. You can fly in a straight line for it. And the conditions that day, they were just... they were perfect conditions. As the Phoenix got real close to the Island, the crew are starting to prepare us for getting off. And my daughter said, "Let's go Dad. I want to be first on the Island." The tour started and uh... we just slowly walked. The two tour guides, one of them would go first and one of them would go last, and as a group we would stay between them. It's kind of like a scene out of Jurassic Park when you approach it. Landing on White Island, first time for me was like landing on the moon kind of, because it's such a surreal kind of environment. So after we landed, I gave them the safety briefing. And I start walking towards the crater. Most of the volcano is underwater. So you're only seeing the top of it. White Island is a stratovolcano. When it erupts, it doesn't tend to have lava flows like the Hawaiian volcanoes. It tends to put down layers of rocks and ash, and build itself up that way. When the Te Puia arrived at the Island, we had to get in these small... they call them "zodiac boats." They're just inflatable rubber boats. There's just a really quick trip to the Island. Yeah, about a minute or two. Then they arrived at this very rickety cement jetty with a rusted metal ladder on it. You had the sounds of the waves crashing onto the beach, washing up onto the shore which gave that sea breeze that smell of the salt. And then you also have this almost like a... a strong malodorous smell of sulfur. It looked quite barren. No signs of life. When we walked off that jetty and got our first real glimpse... I had a picture in my head of what a volcano would look like and this was not it. No lava. Just lots and lots of steam. It was very beautiful, but I felt like we were very much in the middle of nowhere. From there, we created separate groups. My guides on the Island were Hayden and Tipene. Tipene was, I believed to be learning. Hayden was showing him the ropes. Tipene was very inquisitive... always asking questions, you know. Proud to be a Māori. He was excited to have that job. He enjoyed it, going out on the boat, mixing with people. He loved telling them all sorts of stories, Māori myths and legends. He wasn't supposed to work that day. We were going to do some shopping. But he was called into work to fill in for someone and then he went to work. These tour guides and pilots and skippers, they know the Island so well, down to every last rock. They know Whakaari more than anybody else. Alright, everyone! Uh, welcome to White Island. I'll be your guide today for our little tour around the Island. They gave us a hard hat that had a chin strap on it, and then they gave us a respirator. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna head around the side here up to that main crater. Uh, stop at a few points of interest on the way. I'll let you know some information about the Island. Um, so yeah, but as long as everyone's all good, we'll start our tour. We'll get going. The first group left pretty promptly after having a short safety brief. We were still collecting our group together. So what's this for? So you're going to suck on them and it's going to help produce saliva. So that any irritation that you get from the steam itself, it's just going to help soothe it. So you're not coughing so much. The Island track is about a singular loop that you start at the beach. Once you reach the Crater Lake, you turn around and make your way around the Island. And then back to the mouth at the entrance. You got quite a bit of gas on the Island that tries to escape. It's something that has to work its way up through a more viscous muddy substance. So you kind of get that bloop-bloop, those kind of noises going on. So what's happening is the sulphur's coming up with the steam. It's crystallizing, falling back down on top of itself, and then it forms a chimney-like structure, like on a house. And so we call it the sulphur chimney area. The landscape... it's rock and ash and mud. But then strewn amongst these grays are sulphur deposits that are the most beautiful bright yellow, and bright white crystals that seem to sparkle in the sunlight. And you actually get the feeling of the vastness and the power of what you're encroaching on. This glimmer of, you know, Mother Nature at her most beautiful, but at her most deadly. Our guide said that the lake is normally a beautiful bluey-green, and that day it was white because perhaps overnight, there'd been some kind of activity that had caused ash to fall back down on the lake. I think it happens quite often. And for me the guides were good with it, so I was good with it. So we start walking up towards the crater. We stopped to take some photos every couple yards or so, and I talked to our tour guide and I asked him, I said, "So when was the last eruption?" Because I'm get... my... I'm getting a little nervous here. He said there was one in 2013, one in 2016, and I'm like, "Well it's the end of 2019 now and I'm getting really nervous." Hayden mentioned the Island was at a Level-Two risk. He didn't describe what that means at the time. Um, but he did say it's at a higher risk of activity, which to me was worrying. Level One, Level Two didn't really mean a lot. Level One, you know, not much happening. Level Two was heightened activity. And then Level Three was an eruption so, you know that... There was a massive amount of scope between Level One and Level Three. We made our way back down to where we had left off. We got back onto the Phoenix and were just getting ready to leave. We began to chat with one of the tour guides about how all the volcanic activity at White Island had been either overnight or when nobody had been there. So, it was almost like it was being kind to people to visit. It was like "I'll erupt when you're not there" sort of thing. As we left the Island and headed back, I then look back up towards the crater. I can see the tour from the other boat. It was always pretty cool to get up to the crater and just hear everyone gasp and say, "Wow," and "Oh my God, this is amazing," and all start snapping photos. We'd get geologists coming out to see it and really kind of have a look at it. And then you get the other end of the scale, which would be like, "I just want a photo of the crater. I just want this for Instagram." We got to the top of the crater, I would say probably around two o'clock in the afternoon. You're just looking down into this gaping, never-ending pit of steam. It's an intimidating sight. They gave us another opportunity where we could take pictures of us in front of the crater. I noticed another ship, the Phoenix, had just departed the Island, and then we hung out up there for a few minutes, and then started the journey back down. I'm thinking, "Okay, we're on our way down. The tour is coming to an end." So I'm feeling a little bit better. Because they were from a cruise ship, we were sort of on quite a tight time schedule. So we were moving pretty quick. We're on our way back to the jetty. The other tour is probably 10 minutes behind us, and so we're leaving the crater, and Hayden is coming up towards the crater. From the crater you kind of loop back, then it's another 500 meters or so to the beach. I had four passengers that day, two couples. And at that stage, that's where we passed them with the boat, the groups that were walking towards the crater. I did recognize Hayden and said hi to Hayden and... while he made his way up towards the crater with his tour group. We made our journey up to the acid lake. We could see the bubbling in between the clouds of steam that were wafting up into our faces. Hayden had told us that we could only stay there for maybe two to three minutes, just enough time to have a good look and take some photos because the chemicals that were being released at the top there were a lot more harmful. Everyone was rushing to get a photo opportunity. It was time to move on, single file. My sister was right up the front with Hayden. I was with my parents towards the middle of the group. About halfway down to the jetty, there were these two water streams, and they came from different parts of the Island. So the tour guides actually had us stop and stick our fingers in the water and actually taste it. You could actually taste the different mineral contents. I had just tasted the water, and I had my back to the crater, and I heard one of our other tourists say "Hey, look at that!" And you turn around and see this little black cloud coming out of the volcano. It didn't look intimidating. I actually took a picture of it. It was just like a chimney smoke coming up. No sound. We all turn around to see what almost looked like a black firework, or like a dementor from Harry Potter with a black long tail. So we all whipped out our phones, started taking photos. Shortly following, there was another larger bang, followed by a massive, even larger group of rocks, flying into the air, and then slowly that began to increase in intensity and size. I knew... I knew instantly. This is, this is bad news. This is bad news. We need to run. I turned around and saw the plume. It was already taller than White Island. I knew immediately what was going on. My brain had just... was in overdrive and just trying to go as fast as it could to try and work out what to do. Now behind me, I hear Kelsey just yell "Run!" and then it was on. - Go, go, go! - Go, go, go! - Annie! - Annie! Anybody?! At that point, I'm frantic. I'm living my worst nightmare. We hear Hayden up at the front yelling to run, at which point panic set in, and we all just started running for our lives. I had my parents right on my heels. You could feel the shadow of the explosion rise up behind us. We managed to run and take shelter behind a very large outcropping of rocks just before the ash cloud overtook us. It was just a black void. All you could hear was just the sound of rumbling and just the roaring. At that point, there was, there was nothing I could do. We were going around to the next bay which was just around the cliff, and that's when it erupted. - Oh my God! - Oh my God! Oh no. I'm watching it go up and it's beautiful. The white is pure white, the black is dark. It kind of is just... an awesome moment. Within seconds, what was beautiful went eerily sinister. This ash cloud started rolling down over the cliff. The crew are realizing what's happened. The boat has started to speed up significantly. We're still outside. The crew are calling everybody into the cabin. Okay, everybody inside right now. - Go inside, go inside! - Go, go go! Jesus! We were walking towards the coast, and one of my passengers asked me, "Should we run?" And I looked over my shoulder and that's when I saw this massive eruption going on. I remember looking up over my left shoulder and seeing these projectiles arching towards us as well. To me, it looked like it was going up thousands of feet and it just wasn't ending. I looked over at the helicopter, which would have been about three to four hundred meters away from me. So I... that's not an option whatsoever. Option Two was go for some water. So I told them to run for the water. Once I got to the pier, I just went and jumped in. I remember hitting the water and just holding my breath as long as I could. Everything just went black. I just remember rocks hitting me and pelting my hardhat. It was the darkest thing I've ever seen in my life, darker than any night I've ever experienced, just pitch black. If you read any literature on pyroclastic flows, people don't walk out. I knew the odds of getting out of the back of it, so yeah... we just had to take shelter and cross our fingers, really. I held my sunglasses and my gas mask to my face and just didn't let go. I hear other people yelling. It's just horrific. I vividly remember feeling like my back was being burned off. My arms and legs were burned so badly, so quickly, I never even felt them. I heard Matt say, "I'm sorry, Lauren." And that broke my heart. "I hold on to his hand because I thought, "For sure, we're gonna die today and I just want our bodies to be found together." The smell was overwhelming. The heat alone was just unbearable. The superheated steam just um, burning me alive. I did my absolute best not to breathe at all, to keep my mouth shut, to keep my eyes closed. I tried moving into the fetal position, just let my back take brunt of the force. You know, underwater there's no noise. And you're just waiting for kinda, you know, some light to reappear. It feels like you just don't know when it's going to end, because it's just no light, just nothing. At one point, there was a bit of light. I remember looking at it. I thought, "Thank God for that." I started swimming towards it but then it disappeared again. I tell Matt I love him. I yell it every two seconds. "I love you. I love you. I love you." And all I can hear is him screaming in pain. I've never heard him yell like that ever. The pain was just excruciating. The burns went through all my clothes. Two to three minutes was the entire eruption event. It was the most terrifying two minutes of my life by far. "I thought" This is it. This is my last day on this planet. We're going to die on our honeymoon." I remember looking out of that window, and I now can't see the Island at all. It's gone. Time for me felt like it was going slower. "And I always said," Look, if anything ever would happen to me, I feel like I have lived, you know, for my age, a very good full life, "and I'm satisfied to where I got." "But at that time I realized," Nope, I'm not ready to let this go just yet. I think I'm just gonna keep on eh... "trying my best to get out of this situation alive." The ash started to settle on the surface of the water, light started to reappear, and that's when I came back up. I looked behind me towards the Island. You could see that all the... it was still a fine amount of ash still in the air kind of falling down onto the island. First thing I did was yell out Lauren's name. I was in such bad shape, I was afraid she had died. So I just remember being so scar
