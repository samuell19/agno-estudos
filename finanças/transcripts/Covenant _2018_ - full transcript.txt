[digital whirring] [static hissing] [water bubbling] [soft ominous music] [crows cawing] [soft ominous music] [screaming] [Woman] I said push, you little bitch! [Sarah] I won't! You can't have him! We agreed. Think of the power. The money, our future! You're not doing this to me. This baby is... - Your son. Look at him. Look at him. [Officer] Sue, show me 97 on County Road 33. Approaching a woman who may have been in an accident. Stand by on EMS, copy? [Sue] Copy that. [baby crying] Miss, are you okay? Are you injured? What happened? What happened? Come on, come with me. [baby crying] [roaring] Go, go, go, go, go, go! [roaring] [rumbling] [Nefarion] Show me your eyes. You'll never have my son. You hear me? You'll never... [soft ominous music] My God! Where am I? [dramatic music] [soft eerie music] [soft mellow music] Julie, look. It was a mistake, okay? I was drunk. And besides, you just, you can't take Clay away from me just 'cause I made, just 'cause I screwed up. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't work like that. So just... I'll take him this weekend. All right, just... Call me back. [soft mellow music] ♪ 'Cause I've been looking ♪ For too long [coughs] [muffled pop] [muffled screaming] [muffled pop] [truck hisses] [muffled rock music] The Raven. The movie's better than the book. Can't beat Cusack. Six dollars. Six dollars. For an orange juice? Mm-hmm. [Ian] For a fucking orange juice. Here. It's cash only. [Ian] Cash only. What kind of a place only does cash only? I said cash only. You speak English? Cash only. Damned are the children of Nefarion. What? I said you're not from around here, are you? Used to be. [sirens blare] Sergeant Ian Parker. That's Lieutenant, Officer. That's Sheriff to you, son. Okay. You know, I knew your mother when you were a baby. You have her eyes. I mean, before the incident. On account of the closed casket and all. Yeah, well. To me, she was just a crazy old bitch with an old log cabin in the woods. Apparently, that's my problem now. How long you staying? Long enough to take her shit and put it on the market. Why? 'Cause long as your mother's death is under investigation, I need to know where I can find you. Am I a suspect? Well, let's just say you're a person of interest. Wow. Well, let's just say... Good to know. And do you want to move your fucking car? Good talk. [Radio Host] You catch tunes from Interstellar there called High Horse off their latest album Risen. And now here's Moth with State Of Your Wings. [heavy rock music] [soft music] [Sarah] Ian. I... I don't know where to begin. I've practiced this 1000 times. I know you must think I abandoned you, but I didn't. It was to protect you. Anyway, if you're playing this, it means they found me. And I'm afraid they'll find you. I sent Malcolm to the cabin to cover our tracks. We were so close to exposing them. I only pray he made it there in time. Please forgive me for what I'm about to do. I love you, my son. Please find a new home for Edgar. Be careful. They're coming for us all. [soft ominous music] [crows cawing] Okay. I'm there. [crows cawing] Straight on through. Straight on through to what? [crows cawing] Here's your problem. There's no map for hell. [crows cawing] Fuck. [soft ominous music] Excuse me. Just getting a little lost here. Was wondering if I could just get a little help. [crows cawing] Hello? Hello? [crows cawing] Fuck you too. This town really is full of assholes. I'm convinced. [eerie music] [screaming] [children laughing] [crows cawing] [engine revving] [soft eerie music] [door squeaking] Hello? Malcolm. [soft eerie music] [muffled scratching] Malcolm! Is that you? [muffled scratching] Hello? [muffled scratching] [gunshot] Shit. Clay, I really wanted to talk to you, buddy. I really didn't think I was gonna get the voicemail on this one but I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay? I love you, buddy. I'll talk to you tomorrow. [soft music] [eerie music] [soft jingle] [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah, just the side there. Yeah, okay. Okay, thanks. How's it going? How much... How much do I owe you? Jackie Chan, how much? [speaks in foreign language] I don't speak French. I'll tell you what I will do though. Take this. Keep the fucking change. [soft music] [eerie music] [soft opera music] [eerie music] I gotta lay off the pills. [creaking] [soft jingle] [children laughing] Look, just call me when you get this, okay? Great. Hey, this is cute. What is this, bring your kid to work day? Let me guess, you guys are about to bust a pot farmer, right? It's meth country, son. Or maybe you already know that. What's with the newspapers? I don't know. I just got here. Maybe she was allergic to the sun like one of them vampires. Can this guy go wait in the car or something? Guys, look. I don't know, what do you want? Is there a problem? [Sheriff Malloy] Don't know, is there? What do you want? Don't you find it odd, way your mama died? I mean, what makes a person walk into an empty church and set themselves on fire, huh? Preacher said someone who can't forgive themselves or something world changing to hide. Ben, you mind? Guys, I don't know. I'm not a shrink. Right. And she sent you away when you were what? Four? You don't know anything about me. Don't stand there and act like you do. I know you lived in the shadows, moved around. Military school. Airborne. Two botched stints of rehab and two divorces. And a whole bunch of missed child support payments. That about sum things up? I don't know what you and mini-me are looking for, but you better call off the dogs. Barking up the wrong tree. Maybe. Maybe not. All right Ben, let's roll. Hey, Ben. Is there any little girls that live around here? Just you for 20 miles. Don't worry, son. I'll make sure you're not lonely. [soft ominous music] The next words out of your mouth better be one syllable, motherfucker. - Who the fuck are you? - The man in the shed. Did you kill him? What man? What man? Did you kill him? No! Walk. [crows cawing] Open it, now. Fine. But I gotta tell you, Natasha. I've been through way too much shit to get taken down by some Russian Contessa. Name is Jayde. And I'm Ukrainian. Get up. Oh, you fucking bitch. You fucking bitch. Fucking bitch. [eerie music] It's Malcolm. [eerie music] Bullshit. It's true. All of it. Their unholy union with Nefarion grants them unlimited powers and wealth. In two days, the blood moon will rise again. And Nefarion will be summoned. He'll seek the blood sacrifice of an innocent he was denied. Your bloodline. Well, I'm far from innocent. That much I know. And besides, you just said I couldn't be sacrificed. I'm too old. Your son isn't. And he'll send The Six to acquire him, if they haven't already. [Ian] The Six? The Six? His personal bounty hunters. They will kill you for sport and take your son too. - Okay, okay. Look, you know what? This has been so fun. My son is fine, all right? He's literally sitting in front of the TV right now, probably in his favorite pajamas, eating a big bowl of cereal, watching his favorite show. [phone ringing] [Julie] Hey, you've reached Julie. Sorry, I'm not here. At the beep, you know what to do. Ciao. Let me put it in terms you can understand. Your son is in deep shit. Got it? [pounding] Shit. It's the sheriff. I'm getting rid of him. What, back so soon? Come here. What do you want? I need you to come down to the station. Answer a few questions. Do you mind telling me what it's about? Seattle PD got a call from a concerned neighbor. Went by your ex's condo. Place was trashed. Ex-wife and son missing. Neighbor says she ain't seen him in a couple of days. So imagine my surprise when my office got a call asking... - Hey, hey, hey. He's coming. What the? [groans] - Holy shit! - Officer shit, officer shot. Ben, you read me, you read me, I'm hit. Who shot me? They're shooting at me too, asshole. Stay put. I still need you to come down to the station. [intense music] [gunshots] Believe me now? Let's go. [intense music] [gunshots] [Sheriff Malloy] Hey! Where are we going? To the killing ground. [intense music] [coughs] Wait, wait, wait. [Jayde] You all right? Let's go. Just give me a sec. [Jayde] All right. You've got 30. Okay, look. Jayde, I don't even, I'm running on empty here, okay? Like, I don't even know why we're still running. It's not like anyone's chasing us anymore. [growls] [groaning] [growling] [gunshots] [Jayde] That's why. I totally got your back on that one. Oh man. You see when that second guy came in there? When that second guy came in here, I was like, "Oh man, she's in trouble", but I pounced in like a panda. Fuck, I fought that guy. This way? [Jayde] I trained in Rome under His Holiness. [Ian] The Pope taught you how to kill demons? No, of course not. His royal guard did. Okay, all right. Let me get this straight. Those guys back there. They weren't human? Half-human, a new breed. Slavers of our dark future. And the first of the... The Six, right? The assassin and the mortals. Leaving the temptress, shadow, and the earth. And the worst of all, the agery. The agery? The Greeks called them soul eaters. Native Americans said they brought sickness and death. They usually take the form of children. Girls, mostly. [hissing] Did you hear that? What is that? [cackling] The temptress. She smells your fear. Well, I'm not scared. You should be. [soft ominous music] [owl hooting] That's what demons do. Make you see and hear things that can't possibly be. They use your instinct and judgment against you. We should get some sleep. Hey, you hear me? Huh? Yeah. You got the first watch. All right, I got this. I hope so. [Ian] The hell is that supposed to mean? [sighs] Goodnight. [owl hooting] [soft ominous music] What the fuck? [soft eerie music] Julie? You were never this good when we were together. Fucked her yet? What the fuck? [eerie music] Fuck me. Fuck me! What's the matter with you? What are you waiting for, you pussy? What are you waiting for? Get the fuck off me, bitch! Holy shit. What, what is it? [Ian] I saw her. At least, I think I saw her. Some watchdog you are. [Ian] The hell are you doing? What is this? Plan B. [Ian] Plan B. Pure silver. What, is she a fucking werewolf? I'm gonna summon her. Why would you summon her? As soon as she's in the circle, she'll be vulnerable. Plunge that dagger into her brainstem. Oh yeah, so I'm the bait? The worm attracts the fish. The worm always fucking dies! [speaks in foreign language] No no no no, fuck this, fuck this, fuck this. I didn't sign up for this, okay? Here. [eerie music] [growling] Stuff won't let me in. Fucking amateurs. [speaks in foreign language] Voodoo? Voodoo doesn't work on me. Let's kill her. No, we can't risk entering the circle. Besides, she can't escape. Oh but I will, you fucking cunts. What if somebody else comes in here and let's her out while we're... No, they won't. - But what if somebody else... - They won't! Whoever sits by Nefarion's side when the sacrifice is made will be granted eternal power. The ultimate price. He'll use their body as a vessel to leave the forest. She's their competition. You want to know what they're doing to your little brat? Hey, hey! Don't. He's in a cage. With a chain around his neck. Shut the fuck up. Don't, she wants inside your head. [laughs] When Nefarion chews the flesh from his teeny bones, his bones will be extra juicy. Shut the fuck up! No. You mustn't break the circle. [growls] [roaring] Never get any service on these fucking things. What'd you expect? You're still using a flip phone. Hilarious. [crows cawing] What is it? [speaks in foreign language] Huh? [speaks in foreign language] Crows. Hate these birds. When I was a little girl in our farm in Vinnytsia, we were dirt poor. One day, my father brought a kitten home that he rescued from a drug head trying to drown her. I called her Perets. How do you say... Pepper. Like the spice. Loved her. One day I ran outside calling for her, as I always did. But she didn't come. I found her near the cornfield. The crows pecked out her eyes and were eating her alive. My baba called them... [speaks in foreign language] Harbingers of death. I'm sorry. Let's cut through here. You okay back there? Ian? [eerie music] [hissing] [coughing] [groans] [roaring] [intense music] Please, Ian, help me, help! [Ian] Jayde, no! That's not your wife. Come on. No, I'm not okay. No I'm not okay, Jayde, okay? It's pretty obvious they're trying to kill me. All right, they're not trying to kill my son. Are you seeing this? Are you seeing this right here? What am I even doing here? What the fuck are we even doing here? My son right now is safe and I'm not even with him. I should be beside him right now, man. But I'm not. I'm here with you. [phone ringing] Clay. [Clay] Dad? Clay, where are you? [Clay] Dad, it's the shadow man. It's all right, buddy, I'm here, okay? Just talk to me. [laughing] You piece of shit. You piece of fucking shit. If you lay one finger on my son, I will kill you, okay? I will fucking kill you! [laughing] Hello? Hello? Fuck it. [soft ominous music] [engine roaring] Deputy Hanson to dispatch. Possible 1000 at the Parker place. You copy? [static hissing] Sue, you there? [crows cawing] Hold up! Ian, stop. You look like shit. All right, listen. I know you're scared for your son, but you're no good to him if you die of a heart attack or infection on the way. Maybe we should rest. No. No, we keep going. Let me check. Careful. You're burning up. I'm fine. Okay, let's just keep moving. Okay. So here's the deal. Once we are past these grounds, there's no turning back. We enter his domain. I can't promise you I can protect us on that side. Sure you're down for it? I wish I had a choice. But I don't. I assure you, she's quite dead. Yeah, but that's what you said about the circle. You said she couldn't leave the circle. But she did. Did your son say the man in the shadows or the shadow man? Jayde, I don't remember. Okay? - Think, it's important. [Ian] My kid's 10 years old. You're not. I think he said the shadow man. I think he said... I'm pretty sure he said the shadow man. Can we just go? [ominous music] Sheriff? [soft opera music] Who's there? [soft opera music] So how do we find him? If the shadow man is here, he'll find us. He's watching. [eerie music] [door creaking] [ominous music] [door slams] You okay? [clears throat] I don't, I don't feel too hot. Come here. Okay. I'm okay. Your infection's getting worse. You're getting dehydrated. I'm just gonna go get some water. I won't be long. [crows cawing] [roaring] Ian! [eerie music] [muffled screaming] [groaning] [muffled screaming] [Clay] Help me, Dad. Clay! Clay! I'm coming! [groaning] [rumbling] [gunshot] [Jayde] Got you. What did you just do? What did you just do? I saved your ass. If you pass into the Shadow World without an anchor to bring you back, you'd be stuck in that dimension forever. My son is in there. More deceptions, more lies. Have you heard nothing I've said? I was about two fucking seconds from ending this. Two fucking seconds, Jayde. Ending it how, exactly? By killing an immortal that lives in a shadow dimension? It wasn't the shadow man, it was Nefarion. Nefarion. Did you see him? Big fucker, huge horns, seven feet tall? Yeah, he's in there. Did he see you? Ian, did he see you? [coughs] Ian! [coughs] [soft ominous music] What are you doing down here? Where are your parents? [soft jingle] [screaming] We gotta rest. No. You're in septic shock. Just sit here. - Hey, get off me, get off. You don't really get it. My whole life, I've been unsure of everything. Who I'm supposed to be. What I'm supposed to do. Why my parents weren't around. But then I had Clay. And that made sense. He made sense. [soft music] Being a father made sense. It's the only thing that made sense to me in my stupid life. So, yeah. I gotta keep going. I have to. 'Cause... He's all I got. [soft music] It's okay. Just rest. [soft music] [coughs] Jayde? Jayde! [soft music] Hey, Clay. Dad! [Ian] How's it going, buddy? [Clay] Good. It's good to see you, you know that? - Yeah, good to see you too. - Want to get outta here? Yeah, let's get outta here. [soft ominous music] [hissing] [eerie music] [muffled whispering] [groaning] [muffled whispering] [groaning] That's all you got? [crows cawing] What have you done? [muffled whispering] [roars] [eerie music] [rumbling] [crows cawing] [eerie music] Ian! I'm gonna send you back to hell, bitch. No! [gunshots] [groans] No, no, no. Come on, Ian, breathe. [soft music] Breathe, damn it! Come on, Ian. Damn it! It's over. It's over. [soft music] When we get back to the station, if we get back to the station, I'm gonna need an explanation. And a bourbon. Hey, you can't just leave him here like this. He ain't going anywhere. I'll send a crew back. [gasps] Holy shit! Ian! [coughing] [soft ominous music] Okay, look. I know how this whole demon thing sounds really strange. Not strange at all. As a matter of fact, this ain't my first rodeo. I saw them with my own eyes, the first time I met your mother and you. Yeah? Well then why have you been such a dick, huh? [growling] Did you feel that? [soft music] What is it about near death experiences that always make you want... Will you guys shut up? I don't want to have to save your ass a third time. Come on. Come on. [chanting] [Ian] So, where is he? Where's Clay? Must be waiting to bring him out. Bring who out? Him. [rumbling] Hey. You'll blow our cover. What are you doing? I'll tell you what I'm not gonna do. I'm not gonna sit on my ass and watch these freaks summon up some demon to kill my kid. No. Not today. Ian! [chanting] Hey, assholes! You got three seconds to hand over my boy or I start putting holes in heads. One. Two. Your son's not here. Mom? But I... No, no, you're dead. I saw it. What'd you really see, Ian? I don't understand. It's simple really. I broke a deal with the devil 30 years ago. So now it's time to pay. She sacrificed everything. To protect you, so you'd have a better life. But you're nothing but a rotten apple. [Ian] You. You? They were shooting at us. Dickhead was only supposed to graze my arm. I never wanted this for you, Ian. But when they found me, Malcolm, what choice did I have? [Ian] No, no. Besides. Bud's right. [Ian] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your life led down a dark path. Maybe because I was alone for most of it. It's a little late for pity, don't you think? Drop it, now. Jayde. The reality you think you know is a lie. That's what demons do. Make you see and hear things that can't possibly be. Whoever sits by Nefarion's side when the sacrifice is made will be granted eternal power. The ultimate price. He'll use their body as a vessel to leave the forest. Well it looks like they're trying to kill me. And my son? Where is he? It was never about him. I don't get it. Why the charade? If it was about me the whole time, why not just knock me out and just drag my ass here? Now that wouldn't have been that much fun. Besides, I wasn't gonna carry you. You were right though. Clay is probably home, safe and sound. [eerie music] Get on your knees. Stay down. Hold him. [rumbling] [eerie music] Holy mother of God. Who brings my sacrifice? I. I do, my liege. [growls] Are you prepared to relinquish your body and soul for all eternity? Join you, body and soul, is my highest honor. You fucking she-bitch. I trusted you. [growls] [screaming] [groans] Jayde. Jayde, come on. I know our time meant something. Come on, help me. Jayde? Jayde! Mom. Mom, you can stop this. Stop this! Make mama proud. [growls] [speaks in foreign language] For decades, I have lay dormant. Awaiting this moment and awaiting our time to reign. Knowing we'd meet again. Your sacrifice will complete the awakening and seal the end of days. Knowing this night, I gave purpose to your insignificant existence. The world receives you.
