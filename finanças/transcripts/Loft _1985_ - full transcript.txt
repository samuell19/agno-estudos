The apocalypse is at hand. Chaos rules. Fear of total annihilation is the only thing which has delayed the fatal blow. War rages through the streets of the cities... Undeclared war. It has set the cities of the world on fire. It is a fire that no one will ever put out... In a world that has lost all hope, The smoke of destruction has penetrated into the houses, An omnipresent sign of the approaching end. Whoever is not swept up in the totality of the war has plunged into a myasma of sensuality unbounded. So what if we don't make it on time? -We can always go somewhere else -Come on, hurry up! Going up? Going down? Remember, I only agreed to come one one condition... And you know what that is... Not in the elevator! Oh, leave me alone! Who needs you bastards! Get up! We're not serving any food or any booze! Just fuck off! Hey, I said get out! You guys really suck! You're arseholes! Get out of here, you fucking morons! Nobody wants you here! What the fuck do you know about art? Who the hell ever gave you the right to pass judgment? Don't you think she's a wonderfully original touch? Get out and stay out! You poison everything you touch! I must say, this one's 100% my type. Then why don't you take her home? Not that I've got you all tied up... Oh, silly...! Stop it! Cut it out! If you don't mind, I'd like to look at the pictures. Either you love me or you don't love me! If you don't I'm going! If you do love me let's do it, here and now! All right, if you insist... Now, you know what I'm like, you know you drive me crazy! Let's find a place where we can be alone! Come on! Honestly! No one will see us here. You stupid idiot! Look, let's just get it over with! My God! What if somebody comes in? Then they'll get themselves a cheap thrill! What do we care? Did you hear that? I think somebody opened the door! Who cares? Good Lord! How're we gonna handle this? Can't find them. Have you seen Stone anywhere? He isn't in the office? Come with me. I'll show you which one I mean. Oh, for Christ's sake! Haven't you had enough? Let's go back to the exhibition! Not until I can exhibit myself to you! I don't see them anywhere. She's got dark hair and he's blonde. -Pretty boy. -Oh, yeah. I saw them in the elevator. He's oversexed and she's on a culture trip. Do you love me? You're irresistable. You're all I ever wanted in a man. You're a real over-achiever. An overnight success who never needed a penny of his parent's money. A girl would be mad not to love you. -What're you getting at? -Nothing. It's just that I feel like some kind of hooker. Totally interchangable. And you have the gall to ask if I love you. -What's it worth to you? -Everything. I adore you! Oh, that's magnificent, but if you really cared for me you'd find some light switch somehwere. What the hell is the difference where I get my money? The important thing is that we're together! -Don't you feel the same way? -Okay. But I need some idea of where this relationship is going, -Otherwise... -Otherwise, what? Otherwise somewhere along the line, there's gonna be a short cicuit. Kiss me. Well, I'm waiting. Please turn on the light. Come on, let's get out of here! Don't be ridiculous! I can't go out there looking like this! Now you can walk right through there and nobody will recognize you! Look away folks! My girlfriend is ashamed to show her face in here! She's always like this after we make love! Leave me alone! Oh come off it! You know I'm just a little boy at heart! Then go play in the sandbox! -Oh, come on, don't be a spoil sport! -Will you leave me alone? You can make a fool of yourself all you want just leave me out of it! -Are you trying to get rid of me? -Leave me alone! I'll wait for you out here. You can wait until you're blue in the face! Been cryin'? What gives you that idea? You look it. Want some? -You here by yourself? -No. -You think this is boring? -No. -Want to come with me out there? -No! -Impotent? -No! -Dope? -No! -Want me to leave you alone? -No. That means yes! What do you think of the pictures? They're okay. Just okay? No, pure shit! I must say I've seen better pictures on street corners! They fed me better in the army! -Can we still catch the movie? -I dunno. Yeah, we'll make it. Furio, we're off to the flicks. Ciao, adored the show! Really significant stuff here! -Great show! -Thanks for coming. Going home? I think I'll check out the Scooter. -With a date? -No way. Can't play on the field on a leash! Some of these are mine! We're very sensitive spirits! Understand? Very sensitive! She's fallen in love with you! Easy now, girl. Easy. That's it. Now why don't you go to the little girls room and do something about your face? Maybe that way you'll have better luck with the little boys. Is he your lover? Who? -The blonde one! -What about him, huh? He made a pass at me. I really don't think you're his type, dear. How about you? You are his type, huh? -I believe so. -Where do you think you're goin'? Bitch! One sound out of you and... You can save your screams for later... ...when it really starts to hurt! O Tempora, O Mores... And then this gorgeous creature walked Across the dancefloor and put his arms around me like that! -Then what? -Well, then... ...we spent the night in his cabin. Oh, you're putting me on! Sorry Furio, gotta split! -Ciao -Ciao darling! Raphaela! Raphaela! Come on out! Raphaela! For Christ's sake! Stop playing games! Raphaela! Are you alright? Raoul! You did a great job girls. I'm proud of you. You know your way around here? What's the problem? The door to the ladies room is locked. My girlfriend is in there and the other girl too Maybe they just wanted a little privacy... You know how it is with girl talk... You know where the key is? Here! Then unlock the door! Or else I'll break it down! What is this shit? You know I completely forgot to ask you... How do you like the pictures? -Just great! -Good children don't tell lies! Now then I think I think I did forget to ask you... How do you like the pictures? These pictures are a crock of shit! Amateurish! And you've got no talent! And this? How do you like this? It's great! We've been looking for you! Where's Kiddy? And his girlfriend? Are you alright? Did S.M. call? How many pictures did we sell? None! I don't understand! Why are you doing this to us? You must think you're really hot stuff! You cheap little twerp! I'm getting out of here! With my girlfriend! Raphaela, answer me! I don't want any funny business. Otherwise I'll slit your throat... See? He loves you. Yeah? We've already begun Alive. If you kill them now, the game's all over! Are you coming? Yeah. And the doctor? I have no idea. I wonder what happened to his girlfriend. You should have him fighting it. To get into the ladies room. Well, if that's what he wants! What do you want? Help! Help me! Help me! -Yell your guts out, go ahead! -Help me! Open the door Changing of the guard! Well, come on out pudding! You're not going anywhere! Don't move, lady! Hope you're not hurt! Cocksuckers. This one's got a lot to learn about good manners! -Maybe we ought to teach her a few! -Right on! Where would you like to learn your lesson? Now, play close attention princess! Just look at her! Putting on airs! She's got all the class of a grease monkey! Your Imperial Highness! Your stud in there has fallen madly in love with our pictures. I think the very least you can do under the circumstances is fall madly in love with me! What do you want from us? We haven't one anything to you! Do I really have to you what I want? Please! Oh God! This is terrible! Don't make trouble, baby. If you do, I'll chop you up in little pieces. Get those panties off. Want me to help her? When I tell you to take your panties off, you take them off. This is war and you're our prisoner. Why don't you kill me! Just kill me! I wouldn't try that again. I want to talk to him! Couldn't I help you? Why don't you let us out of here? Nothing's happened yet that would... What's the point of all this? I am the way... For those who suffer sorrow. I am the way... To agony and grief. It's pain today... Dark misery tomorrow. What did you say? I don't understand! The holy sacrifice upon the master's alter. A nation cleansed and purified, through pain. The brave survive... When callow cowards... Falter. I know a good doctor! I could call him for you! He can keep his mouth shut! And it wouldn't cost you anything! I've made the world and all that dwell within it... What I've created... I can, of course, destroy. All entering here... Abandon hope this minute! Please don't hurt us! Please let us go! Dance! Through vales of tears! A furious tempest rages! With snakes of lightning slinking across the sky! I'll bring about the end of countless ages! Each living thing will wither, fall and die! Kiss me. I don't want you to die. You must help us! We're being held captive! They've beaten us! One of them raped me! Somebody's got to help! They've locked my boyfriend in the ladies room! They've got a girl with them! One of them is badly injured! Please! You've got to get help for us! That really sucks. Now tell us what else they did to you... My boyfriend comes from a fantastically wealthy family! Just tell me what you want! You can't buy your way out of this hell. Not for all the money in the world. Just tell me what you want! Whatever it is you can have it! What I want? You're pretty. A little souvenir... Now everything's fine again and the poor little misused girl is... ...going back upstairs to the naughty boys! Push the button! Go on! I knew it. He goes crazy if he has to take seconds. He can never wait for the others. Please! Please, I'm prepared to do whatever you want! Just let me out of here! Some people just never learn, do they? Keep your eye on her. How're you doing? It's inevitable now. Make it happen. He's lost a hell of a lot of blood. He's already delirious. What happened with the doctor? He's coming. We hope he is. Who's got the gun now? What happens to our prisoners? They get liquidated. We drown the pretty boy in the toilet and nail his old lady to the wall. I know she'll just love it up there with all the paintings! I haven't done her yet! I want to have some fun! It's inevitable now. Make it happen. Whatever you want, you can have it! Anything! Raoul's filthy rich! You can have whatever you want! Just bring us out of here! Okay. Take off your dress! Well, how do I look? Cute! I'll murder the bitch! I'll murder the bitch! Come on, calm down! Don't act hastily. The whole thing's a big joke! We'll let you go! That'll be the end of that. No bullshit! Raoul! Let Raoul out! Go on! Get going! Go on! Do you hear? Don't move! Stay where you are! I want Raoul! Stay where you are! There was a poem I had to learn at school. I've never forgotten it. It's all about you and me. The two of us. My head on fire with madness, I walked along a road we all must go. And where the raging rivers flow, Fair women stood and brought me gladness. As I approached, I saw they had horror wept. Soon blackest sorrow, on my bosom crept. And watched the sunlight gradually darken The sad stars rose in anguish, The whole world seemed to languish. I heard an awful sound as I did harken. Dead birds crashed down, And choked the river. The universe began to shiver. A voice said, Let Kiddy go! And cut out this bullshit! Or I'll tear you apart. Get Raoul out of there! Go on! Otherwise you can tell your friend goodbye! That was really lovely. Great poem. Really glad you liked it. Move! I love the dress. Looks good on you! I just remembered another verse. My fevered mind was tossed, as in a torrent. And grieving women circled me all around. They said forget those things you love and cherish. You too... Shall perish. You too... You too shall perish. Come on out! I can handle him alone, thanks anyway. Come on out! I'm holding the girl! I'll get you for this! Raoul! What's going on? I'm coming! If she doesn't do exactly what you tell her to, slit her throat! What's happening out there? Anyone who fools with her has had it! Alright, now let me out! The girl is my prisoner! What happened back there? The little weasel's dead! Who are you? We... were at the art show. They took us prisoner! You... killed me. We weren't going to kill you. Neither of you! Honestly! Why don't you cut this out? Just let us out and we'll forget the whole thing. And just walk away! You guys always want to walk away when the going gets tough! I should have killed you when I had the chance. You just killed him. He knew the loveliest verse I ever heard, And you just killed him. How many verses do you know? None! What do you know then? Why do you let that creep crawl all over you? Because of the millions his parents are going to leave him? If I hadn't stopped you, you would have gone out of here alone! -I was going for the police! -That's a lie! Does he mean as much to you as Joker meant to me? After we've murdered him will you cry? After he's dead will you shed one tear? Your life is a lie! It's all a load of balls! You've all got to be exterminated! Every one of you! We'll do the exterminating, just you wait and see! You're about to get a taste of your own medicine! That cutie with the trenchcoat is dead! And your poet just bled to death with a mirror in his throat! You may have thought you could destroy us! But if anybody's gonna get destroyed it's you! Shit! Let me out! Come on! S.M. is dead. Joker is dead. Stone's done for. Keep cool Kid. Leave us in peace! Peace us just a word! You are at war! Leave us alone and we'll forget the whole business! Two people have already died! Then mourn! Mourn for the dead! You creeps think you can make us all conformists like you are! Chameleons! What the hell purpose do you serve? There's no reason for your existance! Can you give me one good reason? You're just waiting for your parents to kick off and leave you a fortune! What do you produce? Nothing but shit! What do you see with your eyes besides blinders? What have you understood? What have you accomplished? You just try and keep everyone in his place! It's all your fault that the world is decaying all around us To make it easier for your bombs to finish us off! You're the quicksand that swallows us up! How about putting an end to this violence? I'm sick of fighting! Let's try to live together! You think you're very clever! You expect to win The way you always won before! But you won't get out of this place alive! Go and get Stone's gun so we can get rid of this creep! I'm sick and tired of it. Joker is gone. S.M. is gone. Daddy's had it. I'm just fed up! Get the gun or else! Or else what? Where's Raphaela? She's locked in the elevator. -Let's have the damn keys! -Keep the keys! I wish it were all over. It won't be over until they stop trying to tell us what to do! Until they stop claiming that lies are truth, Muder, life and war, peace! Give me the key or you'll become one of them! You owe it to Joker! And to Daddy! When he dies he'll have died for you! He always fought against them! And look what they did to him! They cut him up in little pieces! He never had a chance and you want to take this one's side? His time is up! Your lover is dead! And you have a chance to put an end to this violence! Death! Now go get the gun! The sad stars rose in anguish, The whole world seemed to languish. Let me out of here for Christ's sake! Let me out! Let me out! I'm coming! Daddy! Kiddy? Kiddy! Stone? He shot his own daughter. She had Raphaela's dress on. You know you're right. Let's call it quits. I was going to be a pianist. But I became me instead. It's all over. Honestly. Why don't you believe me? Why kill each other just because we don't happen to agree? Let's go get Raphaela. Look I've got the key. And then you can leave and have them arrest me. What's the point of all this? It's war. A ritual. You attended our exhbition, but not one of you Paid any attention to our pictures. We are our pictures! And they strike back when they're insulted! Are you out of your head? Raphaela! You're both free! We made love, she and I! My body became part of hers... Forever! Out of my way or else I'll... You'll always win.... Dammit! But you're not rid of us! We'll come back! Let's get out of here, please! Let's get out of here! Please darling! Kiddy's dead! I fired the shot myself! I want to get out of here! Look! The pictures! They've all disappeared! They've vanished into thin air! So have all the bodies! I love you. I love you and I want to be with you forever! We'll come back! We always do!
