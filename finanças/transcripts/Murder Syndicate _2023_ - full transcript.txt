(ominous electronic music) (ominous electronic music continues) (ominous electronic music continues) (ominous electronic music continues) (ominous electronic music continues) (ominous electronic music fades) - He's doin' it again, Mom. - (scoffs) Jonah, Jonah! Put it away, sweetheart. - Nobody can see it. - That's not the point. Just put it in the clip where it belongs, and stop fidgeting. We're almost there. And you, phone! God, please tell me you don't act like this when I'm not around. - Oh, don't worry, I keep these backseat bitches in line. - You know all about being a backseat bitch, don't you? - (scoffs) Fuck you. - Language, Becca, guys, knock it off! It was a mistake bringing all of you. I wish I just brought Eddie or Duke instead. - Oh, no, we'll lock it up, Mom, okay? Sorry. - [Isa] He's still listenin' to something. - That's how he preps. Let him listen to it, it's not bothering you. - What did I just say? Take them out, Cain. (Cain sighing) - So how many we expectin'? - [Isa] You really don't listen to me, do you? - I just did, didn't I? - 10, maybe more, that's why I want us all there. - You should've brought the M60 for this, Mom. Mow all the motherfuckers down. - Yeah, is that right? You gonna carry that all by yourself? - If I couldn't, who could, right, Cain? - Get your fucking hands off me, dickhole. - That's it, get out! You're driving me crazy today, you know that, right? - [Becca] What about the job? They already paid half up front. - What the hell do I care? I'll give the money back. Because what I'm looking at right now, are my three kids who'd rather act like idiots, instead of trained professionals. - One of them isn't acting. - I'm sorry, okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - I'm not. I'm just wonderin', are these guys gonna be armed, yeah? I mean, they're probably gonna have a stash of some sort? - We went over this at the house, yes. - All right, then. Won't you give Jonah the M4, Becca can have the MP5, Ma, you rock what you rock, and we just sweep the motherfuckers dry. How's that for being focused, ladies? - Let's light 'em up. I can fuck with that. (vehicle approaching) (vehicle stopping) - Okay, we're here. Roddy's gonna pick up the car and torch it, and Zane's gonna meet us down on 6th, questions? - How do we know which car he's gonna be in? - (chuckles) You'll know it's Zane. Okay, pop the trunk and suit up. I'm gonna do a last minute casing. And kids, shit acting is not family. (tense instrumental music) (tense instrumental music continues) (tense instrumental music continues) - Are we doing this or what, lady? - She never disappoints, does she? - [Jonah] Fuck that M60, you feel me? - She knows how to pack it in, I'll give her that. - What was all that directing bullshit you were saying to Mom? Trying to win some brownie points or something? - Just trying to help you two out, guide you two along. - You knew what I like, I ain't complainin'. - You might what trigger-happy boy wants to do. Grab your little piece, and let's go. - Ho ass bitch. (tense instrumental music continues) (footsteps creeping) (footsteps continue creeping) (intense electronic music) (intense electronic music continues) (intense electronic music continues) (intense electronic music continues) - Come on, we late, we late, let's go, let's go, ladies. Hurry that shit up, we got a drop tommorow. (intense electronic music continues) (intense electronic music continues) (intense electronic music continues) Bro, we got four. Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on now, we gotta go! Bro, what you doin', man? We gotta go. Let's go, let's go. (people shouting) (gun firing) (intense electronic music) (intense electronic music continues) (intense electronic music continues) (intense electronic music fades) (Caine farting) (guns rustling) - Let's go. (intense electronic music) (guns firing) (people yelling) - [Thug] Shoot that motherfucker! (guns continue firing) (man yelling) (intense electronic music continues) - Come on, bitch. - [Thug] Come on! (intense electronic music continues) (man yelling) (intense electronic music continues) - Come on. - Shit. - [Thug] Let's get out of here. How much time we got? (people faintly yelling) (vent humming) (vent continues humming) (footsteps tapping) - My kids are gonna kill you. - Shut up! - Shut the fuck up. - Shut up, bitch. - Drop your weapon. - Drop the fucking gun, now. - Drop the fucking guns! - Drop your weapons, I'll drop you right fucking now! - Mom! - Drop your weapons. (everyone chattering) - Shoot him! Just shoot him! - You, got three seconds, three, two... - My kids are gonna kill you. - Shut up, bitch! - Nobody calls Ma a bitch but me. - Cain, oh, Cain, I don't know what happened. - You okay? - Let's get her to the car. - Let's go. - Grab it, grab it, grab it. - I got it. - [Jonah] Grab your gun. Come on, let's go, let's go. - Hurry. - What the hell happened? - Let's go. - I don't know. - Where is he? Get the door, get the door! - Get the pass. - [Zane] What the fuck happened? - [Cane] We don't know. (intense electronic music) - What the fuck happened? - We don't know! - She just collapsed, nobody got hit. It was going fine in there- - It's not fine! If this genius just showed up when he was supposed to. - [Cain] Again, bitch. - Shut up, the both of you! - We gotta take her to a hospital! This has never happened to her. - What, are you out of your fuckin' mind? - Have you noticed anything over the past few days? You're the one spending all the fucking time with her. - What the fuck does that mean? - I think you know exactly what it means, cougar hunter. - Fucking little shit! - Get off me. - Watch the road! - All three of you little shits, you treat your mom like she's some kinda personal cash vendor. - We earn our fuckin' keep. Why the fuck are you still hangin' around? Oh, it better be fucking loaded. Don't fucking try me, Zane, I don't need a reason to pull this fuckin' trigger. - I'm gonna remember this. - I hope you do. - Please stop fighting. - [Zane] What do you want me to do? - Zane. Jesus, take us home. - You got it. (Isa crying) (object shuffling) (Becca sighing) (no audio) (clothes rustling) (Becca slurping) (Caine sighing) - Get any sleep? (Becca sighing) I guess that makes two of us. - Did you come in to see her at all? You that much of a selfish prick? - Not that you'd believe me, but I don't like seeing Mom like that. I don't think I've ever seen her like that, it fucked with me. - Yeah, I haven't either. - When was the last time she even had a cold? Nothing could knock her out like that. That's what I don't get. - Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. It doesn't make any sense. - It's just not her. She's done sweeps 10 times more intense than that and still made it home in time to cook our ungrateful asses dinner. You remember that? - Jonah's practically been by her side all night. He's always been a mama's boy. - Yeah, he's a good kid, means well. Not like assholes like us. What about lover boy? - Oh, don't call him that. - He's such a rat fuck. - He only comes around when it's sexually expedient. - Or financially. - What? - Nothing. - Thought you really wanted to do him in when he was driving. - I did, you have no idea. - She's awake, and wants to talk to all of us. - Let's go, that's good news. - No. She said all of us. - [Becca] I'll call Zane as well. - Just tell him to hurry his ass up. (ominous instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music continues) - I can't explain this. It's not a heart attack, not a stroke. I think we just gotta wait for the blood results to come back. In the meantime, get some rest. And then hit me up if you need anything. - You're a rockstar, Kenny, you always have been. - I've never seen anything drop you like this before, and I'm gonna work my ass off to figure out what it is. - Kenny, really, I could get out of bed right now. I feel so much better. - Stop. I'm going to figure it out so you can kick its ass, and then get back up, all right? - Yeah. - Take of yourself, all right? - Thanks. - Thanks. - All right. - I can't believe he didn't find anything. - Regardless of what Kenny finds out is wrong, I wanted you all here because you're what's most important to me. I really thought I could go on a few more years, but what happened, has me rethinking everything. - Mom, it wasn't even that serious- - Just let me finish. - Shut up. - I think it was a sign, I'm out. - What do you mean you're out? You're gonna kick this and you're gonna bounce back. You can't make a decision like that after one day. - It hasn't been just one day. I've been talking to Zane about this. - You had something to do with this? - Cain, stop it. - Yeah, listen to your little bro, and chill out. - Don't take this out on Zane. This was my decision. He was just someone I could talk to, and bounce ideas off of. 'Cause God knows none of you have been around here much lately. - Mom, we can't do it without you. You organize literally everything. - Yeah, well, you know, I'm more than willing to take the load off while she gets better. - No, the fuck you will. - What did you say? - You seem to have a hearing problem, why don't I correct your ass, don't ya? - Okay, both of you just stop. This is how it's gonna go. I'm not picking you, Cain, or any of you. I'm freezing everything. Clients owed are gonna get their money back, and they'll have to go elsewhere. And no hits are gonna be put in. And that bible stays right next to me. - Honey, we stop now we lose everything. - Well, maybe we should lose everything. I know you all have enough 10 times over to get by. For some of you, it's just recreational at this point. And judging from what happened yesterday, you all screwed up in my book. - What are you talking about? - Don't even pretend to act like you don't know what happened. You showing up late almost got us all killed. - Ma, I- - Oh, don't Ma me! I built this business up myself. You think your father helped? The man was weak. You know the story. - You're right. Whatever you wanna do, I'm okay with it. - Thank you. - Me too, Mom. - Thanks. Cain? - And where the hell did you go last night? - What? - Becca said you left? - 'Cause you did. - I left to go outside with my gun and stand guard. - You're a lying piece of shit. - I don't know who to believe. - Listen, listen, we should talk about this, one-on-one, okay? Maybe you need to settle down, so you can think clearly. - Okay, my mind is clear. This is how it's gonna go, until I say different. - You hear that, lover boy? Looks like we won't be seeing you around as often as you'd like. - Cain, could you stop? - Don't worry about it. Let your big bro process his feelings. Maybe you're right. Maybe we all just need to take a break, calm down, and we can figure everything out when we're clear. - Zane, I just need you and everyone else to just cool it for awhile. No picking up side jobs related to this either. We just have to go radio silent and off the map. But after that, I am gonna pick who leads. I promise, if it makes you feel any better, they're in this room, we all know that. - They? Cause I'm a he. (both moaning) Feel better, baby. - Zane, Zane. - Hm? - I'd love to, but I can't, I've gotta get home. (door creaking) - Mom, what the fuck was that? - Stop pushing him away. You can't treat him like that. He's gone now, probably because of you guys- - He's a piece of shit snake. - Okay, don't start that with me. Our problem is because of you. So just stay out of my business. (Zane huffing) (hand pounding) (Zane huffing) (gun cocking) (feet pattering) - I think she'll be quick with the next move. She doesn't sandbag anything. - Looks like I'm gonna be seeing a lot more of you guys. It's always great catching up, Jonah. Becca, good seeing you. - Thanks. - Now the strong, silent type. Any parting words for me? 'Cause I'm all ears. - Whatever you were thinking, no. You were never really good at it. Things didn't work out between you and my mom, boo. You need to walk away. - [Becca] Cain, I think he gets it. - No, it's okay, I like to hear you speak your mind. Reminds me that he still has one. Besides, maybe you're right. Maybe I didn't think this whole thing all the way through. But that's the fun sometimes, isn't it? - Know this, I don't care what my mom says, I don't wanna see your ass around here anymore. - You ain't just gonna see my ass, you'll see my balls too. - Don't be surprised when I shove it right back up your ass. - As long as you show up on time, big boy. - Somebody's gotta be here to take out the trash. - Take it easy, kid. You kiss your mom with that mouth? - I guess you know what it tastes like. - I don't like him either, but those stupid threats aren't gonna phase him. He's gonna do whatever he wants. - Yeah, would you cool it the fuck off, man. Both of you shit on him way too much. He cares about her like we all do. - You're really that dumb, aren't you? You two have fun. - Don't listen to him. - We gotta watch those two. I'm telling you, for Mom's sake. - Cain respects Mom. And Zane, he's not gonna try anything after all that. - I hope you're right. (feet pattering) (car beeping) - We have a problem. - With Isa? - That bitch Cain? - With everyone. (calm electronic music) (calm electronic music continues) (calm electronic music continues) (calm electronic music continues) (calm electronic music continues) - [Mickey] Whoo-wee! Girl, you look like that J. Johansson, from the "Justice League," the Widow. Come here, spin me in your web. Yo, what is happening, man? How you doing? - It's been awhile, Mickey, what's going on? - You know, killing motherfuckers for a living every single day. Hey, look, he's back here, but can I get you anything? You know we got everything. - Nah, I'm good for now, man. - All right. Oh, I see you're taking it all in. Yeah. Zane's been redecorating. Upgrading, if you will. Murder money, baby. - Hey, look who decided to show up. Where you been, you goofy bastard? - Been busy taking care of my mom. You guys should know that. - Yeah, look man, we're sorry to hear about that. Your mom, though, she's a tough broad. - Real tough, like bullets bouncing off her tough. - Pew-Pew. - Then why haven't you stopped by to see her? She got Zane in on this and then you guys followed. You owe her everything. - Owe her? Look here, little man. I'll fucking kill you, know where you're at. You come around here again acting crazy, I'll fucking kill you. - Oh, oh, ain't a job, ain't a job, okay? Chill. Look, we're family, okay? You hurt, we hurt. We're here to have a good time. Let's have a good time. - Look, Mickey, any other time, you know I wouldn't be like this. But Zane called me over to talk, and I just wanna talk to him. My mind's on other shit right now. Show me where he's at. - All right, all right, follow me. Yeah, man, don't worry about Franklin. His big, Dwayne Johnson looking ass just mad he ain't getting no coochie tonight. - [Jonah] Looks like he's doing just fine. - Yeah, right until I come scoop the bitch up. - Jonah, Jonah, Jonah. There you are. You've been avoiding us. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, why haven't you been doing jobs with us anymore, huh? You problem? - Everyone knows you're the best straight shooter around. - Thanks, Jonah. Looks like you won't be needing this anymore. - Give me the fucking gun. - Ooh, sexy. - And it's heavy. (girls laughing) - Yeah, this might do some damage. - Don't be so nervous, handsome. - That's the smartest thing you've ever done. - Yeah, just relax. - We don't bite. - Unless you want us to. (girls laughing) - Ladies, ladies, let the man see Zane. (faint instrumental music) - If you were as good with a gun as you are with that little toy, maybe my mom could have used you. - [Johnny] Oh, she did, you should ask her about it. - Yo, chill. - You should fuck off and walk away. - She loved my yo-yo. - Oh, my God. - She showed me some of her tricks too. - I'll show you some fucking tricks. You're fucking lucky you piece of shit! - [Franklin] You stay here. - I'll take him back. - Thank you, thank you. - Come on, man. (Zane snorting) - Oh, Jonah, hey! Thanks for coming. - You wanted to talk to me? - Talk? (laughs) Hey, why didn't you offer him something? What do you want, kid? We got everything. - He said he didn't want nothing. - (laughs) What, are you turning me down already? That's not like you. - Maybe I'm not in a celebrating mood, unlike you assholes. You forget about what happened to my mom? You're acting like it's business as usual. I didn't come here to party. So spit it the fuck out what you want. - Whoo. - Whoo. - Looks like somebody finally grew a pair of balls. - And they dropped today, God damn. - Hey, Jonah, did I introduce you to my little baby sister, here, Sonya? - We've met. How are you, sweetheart? - Yeah, we've met. - Please give your mom my regards. We never really hung out too much, but Zane raves about her. - Does he? Sure has a funny way of showing it. - Come on now, we only got room for one prick in this family. - You mean you? - (laughs) I told you, he's good, isn't he? No, I meant that fuck nuts brother of yours, Cain. Besides, we're not family yet. Speaking of which, why don't you give me and little fast-talker over here some privacy? We'll have a little chat. Hey, see this? I don't like drinking alone, so don't make me drink alone. - Fuck it, I'm already here. - (laughs) And he's back, ladies and gentlemen, just like that. I was getting so worried there you were getting soft on me. - What do you expect, man? - (laughs) I'm just kidding! - You haven't visited my mom, ever since she put everything on hold. - Hm. - My brother and sister are barely talking to me. I feel like I'm the only one trying to make peace with everybody. - Why do you think I called you here? - Who the fuck knows? You tell me. - Well, the fact is you are one trustworthy motherfucker, (glass tapping) you always have been. - Yeah, and it cost me being alienated from the rest of my family. - That's not really your fault, exactly. Granted, those shit head siblings of yours really do not appreciate you, but your mother? She cares about you more than anything. She knows you've been there for her every beat. Shit, since she's been sick you've been spending more time with her than I have. You're making me look like a bad boyfriend over here! - What do you want from me? - What do I want? I want you. You're mother trusts you more than anybody. If you pin me to be next in line, I'm gonna make sure you're appreciated. - So all this shit was a fucking pitch? What the fuck do you think I am? My mom said she'd make a decision. - And she chooses those two shit head siblings of yours, what does that say about you? You think they give a fuck about you? All they wanna do is scold you, tell you what to do, (whines). And me? When I'm the fucking boss, no strings attached, you get anything you want. Teamwork. Quid pro quo, (speaks in foreign language)? - I don't know, man. That's family we're talking about. - Yeah, you're right. 'Cause family is a very special thing, it's a very fragile thing. You know why? 'Cause it always changes, it's not always about blood, it's about protection, it's about trust, you feel me? - I have to think about this. - Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. You think, think very hard, long and hard. But before you do that, there's something I want us to do. (ominous instrumental music) Take a little ride. (laughs) You're gonna love this, I promise. - You still haven't told me where we're going. - Don't get all serious on me now. Come on, it'll be a quickie, it's gonna be fun. - You could at least tell me what we're doing. - Look in the glove box. - Open up the glove box. - Why? - It's not gonna bite you, just fucking open it up. - What, the gun? - Yeah, how does it make you feel? - I have enough already. - Yeah, well you know a gun is kinda like a cock. You don't take it out unless you're gonna use it. - What do you want me to do? You know my mom froze everything. We're not allowed to do shit until she tells us to. - It has nothing to do with that, it's its own thing. Only side gig, there's no conflict. - Come on, man don't be such a pussy. You can grab the gun. You're gonna have to use it pretty soon. Fine, you know what then? You don't wanna grab the gun, just grab under the seat. - Seriously? - Yeah, just grab under the seat, I'm not fucking with you. - What the fuck is this? Cut the bullshit, what are you trying to do? - It's 10K. It's half of what I'm getting for this job, and it's all going to you right fucking now. That's what I'm talking about. - What do I have to do? You know what, don't even answer that. Just pull over and I'll take an Uber back. Nobody gives anyone a half gig's pay for not even setting it up or anything. That's not how it works. - It does with us. Don't you get it? It's no more of this backseat bullshit. This is teamwork I'm talking about here. Come on. You take a gig, you get paid for that gig, you get your fair share. That's what I'm talking about. You know what? Fuck it, I'll fucking do the job myself, okay? Just be ready to rock and roll when I come out. Take that money and stuff it in your pants right now for all I fucking care. It's like I said, we're in this all or nothing. You know what I want. - Now I know you're fucking with me. - Well, maybe next time, you'll actually wanna go inside, and get some action. Maybe next time, I'll get you an M60 like you've been dreaming about. Get some high end gigs. Just get in the driver's seat. Be ready to rock and roll, okay, okay? - [Jonah] I know, man. - [Zane] Keep the engine warm. (intense electronic music) (intense electronic music continues) - Come on, motherfucker. - [Zane] Did anybody order a pizza? (intense electronic music continues) (gun firing) (Zane cheering) (Zane laughing) - Whoo! - Go, go, go, go, go, go! (laughs) Whoo! See what we fucking did? We did that, yeah. - You gonna tell me where the fuck to go or what? - Keep going straight, keep going straight. Wait, no, no, no. Slow down, slow down, slow down. You don't wanna make too much attention. You've done this before, right? All right, make a left. - [Jonah] How many you take out? - Enough. (laughs) You should've seen the looks on their fucking faces. - I don't get all this. Who paid you to do this? - It's my own side thing, all right? It has nothing to do with your mom. Don't worry about it. This is between us. That's okay, isn't it? - I still don't get this. If you're getting all these jobs, why does it even fucking matter that you have my mom's business? - Do you like how much money you just made? Fuck this, smell this? I love the smell of that. You like that? - Yeah, it's a shitload. - Do you know who won't give you this? Your fucking brother and your sister. It's like I always say, family is not just about blood. (Zane laughing) (Zane sniffing) Just go straight and do another left. Whoo! You love this, don't you? This is what I fucking live for! (cars whooshing) (cars continue whooshing) (guns rustling) (cars continue whooshing) (cars continue whooshing) (cars continue whooshing) (crickets chirping) (car approaching) (car stopping) (buckle rustling) (Jonah breathing) (bag rustling) (money rustling) (bag rustling) - Fuck. (Jonah breathing) (Jonah breathing) (crickets chirping) - What the fuck are you doing? - What the hell are you doing all night with Zane, huh? Let me guess, partying it up? Getting all coked up, you plotting fucking snake? - You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Then enlighten me, 'cause I can think of only two fucking reasons why you're out with Zane. - What? - You're getting coked up, or he's trying to recruit your ass. - Get a fucking life. What I do shouldn't concern you. - It does when it concerns Mom. - What are you even talking about? - Stop playing stupid, Jonah. You know Zane wants it all, and he's probably playing your ass to get it. - Just fuck off and go home, we're done. - Don't turn your back on me, I'm not done. (men grunting) (Jonah gasping) - [Jonah] Give it to me. - What do we have here? A little payday for a job tonight? You're a fucking snake. - Hand it the fuck over. - You gonna shoot me, Jonah? Well then do it, boo. Pull the trigger, Jonah, do it. (whistles) Nobody home. Pull the trigger, Jonah! That's why you'll never leave this family. Enjoy your money, snake. - Don't fucking come back, asshole. Piece of shit. (ominous instrumental music) (bottle rustling) (feet pattering) (no audio) (no audio) (bottle clanking) (ominous instrumental music) (punches thudding) (glass breaking) - Listen up, motherfucker. I'm gonna keep this real simple. We see you around Jonah again, we are going to kill you. We don't care what it's for. He doesn't want you around. He doesn't need around. We're his family now. - You hear that, motherfucker? - Are we clear? - It might be more helpful if you guys play a game of charades for me. Okay. Which one of you pussies is holding my hair? I've had bitches pull harder than that. - You motherfucking bitch! Do you hear him talking? - Are we clear? - There's only one thing I'm not clear about. I just wanna know who's gonna be sucking who's dick when you're done with me. (punch thudding) (object slapping) (object thudding) - I'm just trying to teach you a useful skill, Rebecca. (ominous instrumental music) Do it again. Just think of someone you hate. I like to think of your father. - What are you thinking about, Mom, honestly? We're all splintered, Cain's M.I.A. Your boy is nowhere. Even Jonah's quiet. Why do you think that is? - I have no idea. Why don't you tell me? - You know what I always admired about you? How smart you are. How you always know what job to give the right person and everything. I'm telling yo, Zane's giving you tunnel vision. - Excuse me? - I can't believe how blind you are. You don't even see what's happening. - Obviously not, so go for it, enlighten me. - We all want to take over for different reasons, but Zane is the only one you cannot give it to. I know you care about him, but he's not family. And he has other motives. - Is that so, and what are they? - You know, I don't even care who gets it between us. But not Zane, mom, fuck, not Zane. Jonah, at least he's loyal. - So, Jonah you trust right? - I think I'd say that, yeah. - Read it. - What is this? - Just read it. - When did he send this? - [Isa] Just scroll up, Becca, last night. - What are you gonna do? - Jonah's out, he wants Zane. Seems pretty straightforward. - Zane's fucking with his head. He got to him. He doesn't want this. - Well, one minute he's trustworthy. And the next, you don't believe him. Which is it, sweetheart? - What about me or Cain even? - What about you? - [Becca] Don't we get a say? - How often did you visit me when I was recovering? Wanna take a guess? And how often was Jonah there? - What about Zane, was he a frequent visitor? I don't wanna play that bullshit game. - Okay, that may be the case, but the one person who was there, the person that you, yourself, said was the most trustworthy, he told me who he wants, and it's not you, or Cain. Funny, isn't it? - You're making the biggest mistake, and you don't even see it. That empire you spent 30 years building, you're just opening the gates, and letting the enemy come in and just take whatever they want. Well done, Mom. (hand slapping) - Get out. (ominous instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music continues) (both sniffing) - Fuck, man. (both cheering) - Good shit. Whoo, told ya, best shit there is. - Better every fucking time. - Up my game, man, up my game. (soft instrumental music) - Were you guys good to suck each other's dicks? Why didn't you save me some? - Sweet baby, Sonya, there is more than enough to go around. - All I'm saying, is don't start the party without me. I like to pace myself. - She really does. - She does? - You're making all kind of gains, aren't ya? - You're the one you said, "Keep it in the family." - He's a funny one, isn't he? He's a funny duck. (quacks) - Yeah? (Zane quacking) - You wanna grab that for me? - Here, let me hold it for you baby. - Yeah? - Fuck, where do you get this shit, man? - Your mother introduced me to all the suppliers, all the stash. How's is she feeling, is she getting better? - What the fuck did you just say? Why don't you go ask her yourself? I'm already doing everything you fucking want me to. Stop killing my buzz. We don't need to talk about this shit. - Okay, man. - Turn that shit up. - You got it, we got shit to do- - Turn the shit up, man! - I'm turning it up, look. I wanna get the ball rolling here. We got some business to attend to. (soft instrumental music continues) He got moves, huh? You been teaching him a thing or two? (both cheering) All right, Jonah and the whale! - You gotta have some other shit around here, man. What are you hiding from me here? - No, no, no, no, no don't touch those. You don't want those, give 'em back. - Why is that? - They'll fuck you up slowly, and not in a good way. - Then why do you have 'em? - Because I'm not in a good way. (laughs) These are downers, you idiot. You want uppers. You wanna celebrate, elevate. - What are we celebrating this time? - Us, family. - Family? - Family. (ominous instrumental music) (door knocking) (ominous instrumental music continues) - What the fuck? - It's not as bad as it looks. - Well it couldn't be much worse. Get your sorry fucking ass in here, before your neighbors think I did it to you. - You got what I want or not? - Yeah it's over there. Come on, shut the door after you, shut the fucking door. - Can I come in first? You want me to lock it too, princess? Happy? - Are you happy? You know, your mom, she left a lot of us out in the cold with her hiatus bullshit. - You can't find any other jobs? - Kid has feet in a lot of things. Just getting this shit was near impossible. Now, they're all clean, virtually, totally untraceable. Now, which one do you want? - [Caine] All of them. (ominous instrumental music continues) - [Roddy] You could walk into city hall, shoot the fuck out of the place, and those dumb shits would not know who to trace. Tell me you're not using these guns for jobs. Dude, look, I don't like him either but he rolls deep, do not do this. - I know what I'm up against. - Yeah? If you know what you're up against, you'll know to just leave it the fuck alone. He's got it, uour mother is recovering. Your sister and your brother are fine now just leave it the fuck alone. - You want the money or not? - Yeah. - Then keep your fucking opinions to yourself, and give me the fucking guns. I didn't come here for a pep talk, I came here to do business. - Look, I don't wanna watch you do something stupid. Your mother has made her choice. I know it sucks, I don't like it either. - Then why didn't you say anything, huh? I know you hate Zane just as much as I do. You've known my mom for 30 years, 30 fucking years, Roddy. You stood on the sideline like a little bitch. - You know, you've always had a big mouth kid. Let me tell you something, I'm not your brother, and I'm not your sister. I don't take that shit from you, because I will make what they did to you look like a fucking cakewalk. - They already took my brother. And Becca's out. And Ma, you know when she makes a choice, she becomes a stubborn bitch. Doesn't change her mind. The little fucker took what left I had and ran with it. This, this is all I know, Roddy. And I'm not gonna bend a fucking knee to him, and I know you aren't either, qnd that's why we're doing this. - I'm asking you take your stuff and get out now. I'll keep this, I'll help you get into your car. - You don't get it, do you? When I said, "We're doing this," I meant we are doing this. How long has it been, Roddy? - What are you talking about? - You know, I remember hearing it on the news. I knew something didn't add up. I know him well too. If Zane would have been doing his fucking job that day, shit would have gone down differently. Maybe, if Sabina- - No, no, no, no. You never say that word to me. You're just a fucking snake like Zane, except you try to hide it better, 'cause you know I have a love for your mother, and this family, but you're still a fucking snake. You use my own blood, and what happened, to get me to work with you. I should just fucking do you right now, you son of a bitch. It might stop a lot of shit that's gonna go down. - I'd be the happiest boy in the world right now, if you pulled that trigger, but you ain't gonna. - Getting rid of you? Oh, that would be so fucking easy. - Nate. That's what I thought. You ain't gonna, because of my family. (ominous instrumental music continues) We both know I'm a prick, that doesn't change anything. There are lines you don't cross. You know it and I know it. Zane doesn't give a fuck. He'll take any part of our families, and use them as pawns in his little fucking games. He's already torn yours apart, and now he's working on mine, and I can't let that happen. I know there are times where it looks like, I don't give a fuck. I do half-assed jobs, I show up late, I rib on Jonah. But I'd never turn my back on them, ever! Because that's my fucking family. Now I can't prove it, but it sure as hell ain't a coincidence that Zane shows up, and people start dying left and right, and all of a sudden, he starts rising to the top. I fucking need you, Roddy. You can't let this scumbag end my family, you just can't. - We're done, now. (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) - I want you to think about every job that you've done, every single time that you've worked with Zane, just really think about it, and then you tell me whether or not you think I'm lying about him. (door slamming) (feet pattering) (gun firing) - No, no, no, please. Please, ah, no, no. (gun firing) - (laughs) Nicely done. - [Jonah] You're not so bad yourself. (phone ringing) - Shit. Yo. No, no, no, perfect timing. Yeah, just come up to the door, and I'll let you in. Do the secret knock, all right. - Who the hell was that? - That's the last piece of the puzzle. - Coming here? You couldn't have picked a better spot? - It's the perfect spot. 5-0 doesn't know we're here. Nobody knows we're here. These guys certainly don't know we're fucking here. - Still, man, I don't like dicking around after- - Hey, relax, it'll be quick. Plus, you already know this guy. (feet pattering) - What the fuck, man. (feet pattering) (feet continue pattering) (clothes rustling) (feet pattering) - (laughs) Looks like we're getting the band back together. - Roddy? - Well, it looks like you two boys are having way too much fun. - What are you doing here? - I was invited. - Yeah, I figured we can't complete our team without our MVP clean-up man on the crew. - Where have you been, man? - I've been keeping my head down like everyone else. - It's about to get a lot busier, because we gotta talk some business. - Why did you bring me here, to just go up there, and clean up that mess, seriously? - Think bigger. - OH you mean you've got lots of rooms up there with lots of bodies and I'm gonna clean up all of them? - I'm talking about doing this full time again, going all in. You think the last 30 years have been good to you? You ain't seen nothing yet. - Does Isa want this? - We all want this. - Who the fuck is we? - Her boy, for one, herself, another. And I figure a ringing endorsement from the living legend himself, could only seal the deal. - Oh, right. You know, you two were doing so well without me. What happened? Don't tell me, of course. You need that last endorsement. Then you'll get it, the holy bible. - I thought you said she gave you the bible. - Basically, she already did. We're all good. All I'm doing here is making sure anyone who has been loyal is paid there due. - Zane, out of all your wondrous talents, listening to you trying to convince me, is like listening to a sloppy-assed old used car salesman try to sell me something. - You know I just did 15 people upstairs, so pardon me if I'm not speaking eloquently right now. - Oh, I'm sorry, oh, did I upset the little boy? - Come on you're a fucking numbers guy anyway. Right, fuck my wordage. Tell him, Jonah. I've upped everybody who's been loyal to Isa who is now loyal to me. - Is this right, Zane's looking after you? (ominous instrumental music) - Yeah. - You haven't seen much of your family, since your mother got ill, have you? - What are you talking about? I'm with family right now. - My boy. - I guess you want me to work for you exclusively, so that I will give this wonderful endorsement. - She sees you give me the thumbs up, she gives me the rest of the numbers. That's all I need. - You know what? I need time to digest this. It's just too much information. I'll clean up the room upstairs for you like I said I would. - Don't you wanna hear the numbers? - I'm sure you'll pay me what it's worth. Look, I got a lot of shit in the truck I've gotta bring in here so I'm gonna go out and get it, all right? - Hey, you're doing a good thing. It's a good call. You're on the right team again. - Yeah, I'll be back. (Zane laughing) - We're good to go. We're golden, you see that? He's in, right? - Yeah. I think he's gonna endorse you. - (laughs) We're gonna celebrate tonight. We're gonna have a party. My sister is in my house waiting for you. - That sounds great. But I think I'm a bit tired. I'm probably just gonna go back home and pass the fuck out, okay? - Well, hey, look, if you change your mind, we'll be going all night. - Yeah? You gonna finally invite my mom over too? - What's the matter? You're getting a little testy there, aren't ya? - Nah, I'm just a little out of it right now. I'm sorry, we'll talk later, all right? (ominous instrumental music continues) - Well, that was interesting. (birds chirping) (door slamming) - Well if you're going to stand there, and stare, do you want to help me while you're doing it? - Yeah, sorry. - So you and Zane, eh? - I haven't thought it would happen either. Didn't think he'd want me as his right-hand man out of everybody. - You ever thought to ask yourself why? - It's going good so far. He's taking good care of me. Better than I ever was. - So Zane's now your family? He's looking after you? - You know what I mean. - No, I don't. - Look, you and I don't know each other very well, with you mostly taking care of all the shit after-the-fact, but let me fill you in, my brother, my sister, they don't give a fuck about me, they never did. So yeah, it feels good for a change to finally have somebody who puts me out on the line for nothing in return. - Nothing in return, eh? You know, he gets a lot in return. If you can convince me to roll over, and go to Isa and tell her that he's the one. (laughs) - Whatever, man. You do whatever the fuck you want. Zane's offering you gold, and you'd be a dumb fuck for not taking it. - Seen your brother lately? - What did you say? - It's a simple question, have you seen Cain lately? - Not since the prick ambushed me. - Well I guess he learned his lesson then. Did you happen to see him after that? - No. - So he hasn't tried to hit you up for anything? - No, he hasn't. What the fuck's your point? - He's alert. He knows what's going on. He knows not to fuck with people in power. I gotta go. The boss wants me. I've gotta do things for him. You, take care of yourself. - Fuck. (birds chirping) (cars whooshing) (car beeping) (engine revving) (car whooshing) - That for me. Mm. That's good. (phone ringing) Jonah? - Hey, Kenny. Sorry, I got held up. What's up with Isa? - I got the test results back. It was negative, there's nothing wrong with her, yeah. Whoever did it, it was intentional. No accident. It had to be someone close to her, someone in the circle. I know. The best action now is to keep getting her rest, and to keep me posted. Let me know if she needs anything. (Jonah panting) (car beeping) (door slamming) - [Franklin] Take in the nose, like, what's up with that shit? Hey, let's go. - Hey. - What's up, brother, what's good? - Hey. - Y'all ready? Aye, let's do a big one right here. Let's get it. - Cheers. - [Franklin] Even though we did that. - So why's your brother hanging out with Jonah so much? - Yeah, don't tell me you both actually like doing jobs with him. - I told y'all not to say anything. - Why don't you two mind your own fucking business? Don't forget where you are. - Don't make us throw y'all asses out of here, saying some shit like that. - Time to bounce. Did you hear me? I said get the fuck out of here! Take your girlfriends, find a nice view, maybe roll down a fucking hill! Get some grass stains. Go! - Yo, what happened? - Do we really gotta go though? We just ordered hot wings. - Hot wings? I wanna be alone! Don't sit, stand, and then walk. - Come on, y'all. - Get the fuck out, go, go! Fuck. - You gonna kick me out too? - Fucking wish I could. This has nothing to do with that old fuck. - Where's Jonah? - He decided to take the night off. - That doesn't sound like him. - Everybody's acting a little odd around here. - Okay, what's going on, hmm, what is it? - I lose him, I lose everything. - What are you talking about, huh? What is it? - Nothing, nothing. Just thinking out loud, okay? - You told me once we had him, the rest would follow. So what the fuck do I need to do to unfuck this, huh? Tell me! - Keep your legs open. - Fuck you. - You little fucking shit. - How dare you. Look, I just know how close we are to this. And I know how hard you've been busting your ass. We just can't give up right now, we can't. - I know. - Okay, then what are you gonna do? I need to know the plan. - Shut up! - Here, let me- - I got it! - Are those Tic Tacs? - He knows. (ominous instrumental music) (guns rustling) (Becca sighing) (guns rustling) - I'm helping you out, but then you're on your own. Cain, do you hear me? You're going solo. (guns rustling) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (car whooshing) (door slamming) (intense instrumental music) (door knocking) (people faintly speaking) - Mom you there? - Jonah, what are you- - Come on, open up! - Oh my, God, Jonah, it's two o'clock in the morning. Can't this wait? - You weren't picking up your phone. We need to talk now. There's something you need to know. - Sweetie, now's just not a good time. - No it can't wait, Mom. - You doing okay, babe? - Yeah. Uh, just trying to figure out what's going on. - What is going on, what is going on? - [Isa] Knock it off. - What is going on Jonah? Jonah! - What are you doing here? - Why are you here? Yes, that's a very good question. He, uh, he surprised me and stopped by, and by the way, it's about time, because if it had been one more day, I would have had you... (Isa laughing) (Zane murmuring) - Stop it. - I've been so busy, baby. I've been so busy. I just had to make the time and finally come and do what's right. - Okay, knock it off my son is right here, stop. - Enough about us. What are you doing here? You got any news to share with us? - I guess not, we can talk about it tomorrow. - Jonah, you look like you're in shock. I know this is confusing, and believe me, I was ready to break up with this son of a bitch. - Who are you calling bitch? Who are you calling bitch? - Oh, stop it. He came over tonight, and I don't know. We just worked everything out. - I'm sorry for coming over so late. There are still things we need to talk about, Mom, that I think you would want to know, alone. - Okay, Jonah. I'm running around like crazy tomorrow morning, but how about you come over before I go over to Zane's, does that work? - What's going down tomorrow? - Oh I didn't tell him. - You didn't tell him? - No, I didn't. Do you want to tell him? - Yeah, maybe I should break the news. - Okay. - We're gathering together in a holy union of sorts. A proverbial passing of the bible. - Is that true, Mom? - Yeah. We finally made a decision. I don't know. He told me how he's taking you under his wing, and you're like a son to him. It just feels right. So tomorrow, I'm gonna give him the business, and we're gonna have a little party at his house to celebrate. - At his house? Why don't we have it here, at your place? I think it's more fitting, and Zane is such a gentleman. I'm sure he'll be okay with it. - [Isa] That could be good too, what do you think, honey? - We'll have a real celebration. - Okay, honey. - My sister's setting up all the chairs at my house. - It makes so much more sense to have it here. I can even bring him little present tomorrow. We gotta have all eyes on Zane. - Okay. - You deserve it after all. - Jonah, I think it's a great idea. I love the sight of you. Sweetheart, just go home and get some rest. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Mom. Zane taught me a whole lot, and it really opened my eyes, but, remember, don't pass the bible off tomorrow, until I get here. I want to be here when it all unfolds in person. So promise me, Mom. - Honey, I promise. I don't know why you're acting like this. Honey, it's awesome. Don't worry about anything, Jonah. - No matter what, I'll be here. I don't want to miss it. - Stop worrying about everything, it's okay. - We're a family. - Aw, yeah, we are. Jonah, I know a mother's not supposed to have favorites, but you've always been mine. I love you, baby. - Love you too, Mom. - Okay. (both laughing) See you tomorrow. Come on, let's go to sleep. - Night. - Family. - [Jonah] Family, motherfucker. - Bring it. - I know. (ominous instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music continues) (upbeat instrumental music) (people chattering) (people laughing) (upbeat instrumental music continues) (people cheering) (upbeat instrumental music continues) (upbeat instrumental music continues) (upbeat instrumental music continues) - Big man. So what's this I hear about you getting cozy with Jonah? - None of your business. - What you asking us some shit like that for? - I don't mean no disrespect that's just what I heard. - Wrong question. - Man, get you're ass out of here. What you still doing standing there? Get outta here. - Ladies. - Can you believe this motherfucker? - Hey can we get on with this shit? - I told you nothing happens, until the little prick shows up. - I still want to gouge that motherfucker's eyes out. - Yeah, well, you may get your chance. For now, just stay calm. Ignore everybody here. I think he's bluffing. - And what if he's not? - We got it anyway. - Got what? - Chicken wings. Get ready. - It's time to eat. - Isa. - Oh, Ken, you came. - How are you feeling? - Honestly? Better than ever. - That makes me feel so good. Listen, is there some place you, and I can talk in private? - Well, we can talk in the house. What is it, is it about work? - It's business-related. I just have something to talk to you about. It's really- - May I have this dance? - I don't hear any music. - Well, let's make some. (Isa laughing) - You see why I like him, this man's nice. - So romantic. - [Isa] He is romantic. - What's up, Doc? - Zane. - [Zane] Thanks for coming. - I wouldn't miss a moment like this, would I? I've known you guys, well Isa, for a very, very long time - Okay, what did you want to say, before the man of the hour rudely interrupted us? - Oh you're blaming me now? - I blame you for everything. Everything that happens you're gonna be in trouble for it. (all laughing) - What did I get into? - Okay, but really, what is it Kenny? - Yeah, I think your mouth was moving, and something was trying to come out but I don't know what it was. (both laughing) - I just wanted to check in on you. Yeah, that's all. And I can see you're perfectly back to normal. Right? - Yes, I feel great. - Great, it's okay. I don't know why I made such a big deal out of saying that. (all laughing) Oh, man. - I don't know what's going on. - [Kenny] Oh, I'm so glad you're feeling better. - Oh, look who it is. - Oh, Jonah, dear. Oh, go get him, okay? - It's almost time. - Yeah. (Zane scoffing) - I don't know why he's acting like that. He's acting a little crazy. He must just be nervous or something. - Must be, yeah. - Excuse me. - I bet. - Jonah, there he is, glad you made it. - I've got nothing to say to you. - Fair enough. Whatever it is you're thinking about doing, don't. It's not worth it, son. Whatever you think you know, you don't know shit. It's a mistake. You know what we do with mistakes? We make mistakes, and we move on. (laughs) Look at your mother. She's happy, I'm happy, end of story. - You can't take back what you've already done. - Hey, baby, where you been, huh? - Do you think I'm stupid? - What? - You were in on it the whole time. - I don't know what you're talking about. - And you weren't even that good of a fuck. Stay the hell away from me and my family. (people chattering) (people continue chattering) - Everybody gather. I know this was very short notice so a lot of people couldn't make it. Thank you to those who showed up. It shows a lot of respect. Now if only you could have showed up to your jobs on time when I was actually doing this. (everyone laughing) About a month ago, I came to the realization it was time to pass the torch, and I can't think of anyone more deserving than Zane. He walked into my life a couple years ago, and proved to me that not all men deserve a bullet between the eyes. (everyone laughing) Come up here, baby. I'm not just giving you my contacts today. I'm giving you my trust and my blessings, because I love you. - I love you. - [Crowd] Aw. (crowd cheering) - [Zane] What the fuck is that? - That's what got you sick, Mom. Only it was meant to kill you, and the guy right next to you is the one who did it. - See this is why bars card minors. Maybe you should lay off the adult beverages. Mickey, Franklin, why don't you take Jonah out front and give him some fresh air? - Don't you touch my son. (intense instrumental music) - Is this true? - No. Come on, they're on fucking drugs. They're out of their fucking minds. - You know, I knew you'd say something like that. So don't even take my word for it. Ask Kenny. Kenny, was that the drug that was used to try to take out my mom? - It was. - Come on, you gonna believe some fucking pill-popping doctor feel-good, huh? They're framing me! They're jealous. This is envy. - All you ever wanted, was to take over the business. That was your plan the whole time. You tried to flip the switch, and it almost worked. And then you tried to use me. You even had your own sister fuck me to try to get me to endorse you. It was a good fucking try, I'll give you that. But you're not family, and you never fucking will be. I'll let my mom decide what she's gonna do with you now, but you're not getting shit she's built. You're finished. - Honey, listen to me, this isn't true. I would never do this, you gotta believe me. Please, you're my wife. I would never do this. - I'm not your fucking wife, you bastard! Get the fuck out of my house! - You're fucking crazy, all of you! You don't even know what you're losing. - Get the fuck out of here. - When I said to drop it, I meant it. Kill 'em all! - Fuck. (people screaming) (guns firing) (people continue screaming) (guns continue firing) (people continue screaming) (guns continue firing) (people continue screaming) (guns continue firing) (intense instrumental music) - Please get up, please get up, please! (intense instrumental music continues) - Mom! (guns firing) - No! Die, bitch. (gun firing) Oh, God, Jonah. (intense instrumental music) - [Zane] Motherfuckers. (guns firing) (Zane groaning) (guns firing) (Caine screaming) - Fuck. (guns firing) (intense instrumental music continues) (guns firing) (gun clicking) - Okay. It's gonna be okay. Can you hear me? Jonah? Just hold on a little bit. Oh, Jonah, please hold on. Oh, God, no! My baby. My little baby. Oh, my baby. Oh, God, no. (intense instrumental music) (men grunting) (hits thudding) (intense instrumental music continues) (men continue grunting) (hits continue thudding) (intense instrumental music) - Any last words? - Nice tux. - Save it. It's a rental. - Don't do it. - Isa, help me. - I don't think so. - I wasn't trying to kill you. - What did you want? - I just wanted you to need me. - Oh fuck off. Rot in hell, baby. - No. (gun firing) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (soft instrumental music) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) - Hey. (soft instrumental music continues) So many times you weren't there when I needed you. But you're here when I needed you the most. Thank you. (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) (soft instrumental music continues) Cain. Let's go home. (soft instrumental music continues) (suspenseful instrumental music continues) (suspenseful instrumental music continues) (suspenseful instrumental music continues) (suspenseful instrumental music continues) (suspenseful instrumental music fades) (ominous instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music continues) (ominous instrumental music fades)
