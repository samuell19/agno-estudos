- The Iwa bird is amazing. It can fly around the world without landing. It goes through clouds and travels through air streams. It can even fly when it's sleeping; high above the world, feeling the wind, spreading its wings, never landing, going anywhere, soaring free. Yeah, like one month ago. - It's on my list, okay? - It's on what list? Do chore stuff around here first. - Well there's nothin' else I can do. - You know what? - How am I supposed to fend for myself if we don't help each other, huh? - We got nobody else to rely on. - No, I told you that we needed that fence up because I'm sick and tired of having that dog. - Fucking haoles. First they knocked down his house, then they put this crap up. I would never let someone take my house like Uncle Pinok did. - It wasn't his fault, the bank took it. Pinok, do you remember when he taught us how to throw net? How old were we, five? - Yeah, long time ago. He left with his boat and the stupid magazines. - You talk like he's dead. You ready for Friday? - We take your boat out to the island and find the bird. - Storm season, that's when they'll be there. You told you stepdad you're going, right? - I still gotta ask. All I know is storm season's almost over. We gotta go soon. - Okay, so we're gonna continue what we practiced last week, Monday. Hey. And continue to do this - the spelling words and the vocabulary words that we started studying last week. Okay, you can sit in that there. Class, can I get your attention please? We are gonna welcome a new student. His name is Jonah Morris. He's our new student. Can everybody welcome him please? - Hi. - Hey, haole. - Mr. Apo, go to the principal's office right now! - Every time me. I might as well just go school in the principal's office. - Now! Okay, class where were we again? The spelling words and the vocabulary words that we said. - And so we drove towards Florida and my grandparents lived in the villages which is like in the middle of Florida. - Man, fuck that haole. He got me in trouble. - You kinda started it. - Leave him alone, Kai! - Shut up. C'mon, let's scrap. - I don't want trouble. - Pussy. - Motherfucker. - C'mon. - Lemme go! - Let's get outta here, Kai. - I'll fuckin' kill him. - Kai! - You shouldn't have grabbed me. - The security was coming. Do you really wanna get suspended again? Your stepdad would lose it. - Fuck him. I don't need nobody. - Get your fuckin' ass inside! - Come have dinner at my house. - Can I eat something else? - No. Eat. - I work hard to put food on the table. You eat. - You and those birds. - You think you're tired of hearing about Iwa birds? I gotta listen to it all day. - Oh, come on. They're so cool. Did you know the Iwa bird can fly months without landing? They go through clouds and travel through air streams. People don't think the Iwa bird lands in Kapapa Island. I'll take a picture and prove they land there during storm season, just like Uncle Pinok always said. If I find one, I know I'll win the scholarship and get to travel everywhere in the world. - Stop talking already and eat. Man, Uncle Pinok had to teach you about those birds. Well now look at him. Hey, have you checked if the motor on Pinok's old boat runs? It's been out there over a year already. - We're gonna check tomorrow after school. - Hi. We just popped by to introduce ourselves. I'm Carl, this is my son, Jonah. We're from Phoenix and new to the neighborhood. Say hi, Jonah. - Hello. - Well anyway, we thought it'd be a good idea to get to know the neighbors and beautiful, it's just really beautiful here. It's good to meet you. C'mon. - Never take anything from people like that for free. - Why? - Because to them, nothing is free. Uncle Rudy, Paul, Kelly, Auntie Pearl, Pinok, our whole family used to have a house down this side. Now only us. It's getting so goddamn expensive. - You helped Uncle Pinok for how long? You gave him money, even a place to stay. Don't feel bad. - When your dad coming home? - My mom said any day now. Thanks for dinner, auntie and uncle. - Can I just eat half? I don't like pork and beans. Hello? I'm talking. - How many times I told you stop complaining about the food? - I don't like it. - Dad says times is hard. I can't wait to get out of here. - I wish I could go. - One day, I'm gonna travel the world. I'm gonna go to New Zealand, Africa. I'll find a place for us to live. - Promise? - I promise. - Can I sleep with you? - Yeah. - Could you tell me about the Iwa again? - You're the only one that wants to hear. Well the Iwa or the great frigate has a hook-shaped bill and wings shaped like a boomerang. - Why is it called Iwa? - Well the Iwa means thief in Hawaiian. And when the Iwa feeds, they steal the fish of the smaller birds. Sometimes they shake the bird so hard that it regurgitates in mid-air, then they eat what it spit ups. - That's gross, eww. - Let's go to sleep. - What, they fired you? What you did? - I told you laid off, not fired and I never do nothing! - That's your problem, you always do nothing. I told you to leave that job and take the other one. - I know! - And what did you tell me? You gave them your word. That's not how the world works anymore. Your word's not gonna help us keep this house. This is making me so sick! - I told you, I get one plan. I'm gonna sell the truck. I'm gonna sell Pinok's boat! - That thing is not worth shit! - I've already get one guy offering three grand! He gon' come by Monday with the cash, he said! - You better take 'em. - I will. - You better. - I said, I will! - My dad's selling the boat on Monday. We have to go out this weekend. - I asked my stepdad. He said, no. He said they're gonna kill me if I miss practice. - Then I'm going out by myself. I'm sorry, I gotta go. I need this. I need this more than anything. Let's go buy some batteries then. - Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly. Fly. - Let's go to another store. - Next one's too far away. - Fly, fly. - Watch this. - Don't. - He's crazy. Watch. - Fly, fly. Hey, hey, give it back. - Here, Mango Man. - Don't call him that. Give it back! Give it back. - C'mon. Stop it, man. - Give it back! - Stop that! Come inside, buy something or go home. - Why do you let him stay out here? How come you don't call the police or something? Go. - You know, burn in hell. - This look like heaven to you? I hate that crazy stink fuck up. - Come on, that's not cool and you know it. - He's weak. I'm not gonna turn weak like him. - Are you okay? - My stepdad. - Why, what happened? - He got mad. I got lickings from a haole. - How bad? - Bad. Ooh, friggin' expensive. - We need them for the flashlights just in case. - $15. - What? That's crazy. - You no like it, you go. - Fine! Damn. Let's bounce. I'm gonna kick his fuckin' ass. He's lucky he not out here. Haole. - What'd you say? - Haole. - C'mon, we're gonna be late. Just leave him alone. Haole. Haole. Haole. - Okay so next Monday, we'll be having our test on colonization all the way up to the overthrow of the queen. So can anyone tell me what year James Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands? Yes, Jonah. - 1778. - Excellent, Jonah. Okay and over the next 100 years, what percentage of the Native Hawaiians were wiped off the face of the earth? - I'm not sure. Like 3/4? - Close. Like 90 %. - You bitches! - Mr. Apo, you need to report to the principal's office right now! We're gonna meet with your parents and I'll be notifying them after school! - Fuck you, you Jap bitch! - What are we gonna do? We got to be out there today. - We need another boat or another engine. - Thanks for coming. I know how hard it must've been. - Fuck my stepdad. Fuck. Watch what my dad does to him when he gets out of prison. My mom said any day now he should be out. - I appreciate it. - Look, you'd do the same for me. - You know who does have an outboard engine? - The haole? What, like steal 'em? - No, I mean I can ask. - You could ask anybody. - Who am I gonna ask? Hardly anybody has a boat out here and it's too expensive. Plus. - Plus what? - He did pay for our batteries. - So? - So that means he wants to be friends. - Maybe. - Are you mad? - Why everybody always think I'm mad for? - Because you're always mad. - Ask him. - Are you sure? - Yeah 'cause then after we're done using it, I can kick his ass. - What do you need it for? - Well me and my friend were gonna take our boat out to Kapapa Island. We were gonna camp there tonight. - I don't know. My dad might get mad if I let you take it. - No, that's fine. I understand. - Let's go inside. I'm looking for my binoculars. They got lost in the move. Why are you guys going to the island? - Well me and my friend are looking for this bird. - Oh yeah? What kinda bird? - The Iwa bird. - You mean the great frigate bird? - Yeah, you know what that is? - Definitely. It has a seven-foot wingspan. It flies in cumulus clouds. - Yeah, it flies through turbulence and can even fly when it's sleeping. It's so cool. - Yeah, it's pretty much the coolest bird ever. I learned about it when my family and I went on vacation to the Galapagos Islands. - You went to the Galapagos Islands? - Yup, it's so cool. There's like 60 different types of birds there. - Yeah and most of them can only be found there. - Yup. I have pictures, wanna see? - Well I kinda gotta find another engine. - Oh. - I guess I'll see you around. - Hey. - Yeah? - The aloha spirit. - What about it? - My parents blabbed about it for weeks before we moved. It would be hypocritical for them to mind. - Are you serious? Thanks, man. Really. I'm gonna go run home and grab my hand truck. - Can I come? - Your parents won't mind? - My parents don't care. I sleep over at friend's houses all the time. I'll just leave 'em a note. What's your name again? - You know my friend is coming, right? - Oh yeah? - Yeah, my friend you kinda got in a fight with. - I don't mind. I wanna apologize to him for whatever it was I did. Ever kneeboard? Let's take it I'll teach you. No hard feelings? - We gotta go. We're losing light and tide's dropping. Look, reef's sticking up. - Can I drive? - I'm driving. - When have you ever drove a boat before? - My dad showed me. - Your dad's been gone for like five years. His dad's in prison. - Besides, like when haole gonna know the reefs of Kanoi Bay? - There's no reception out here. Do you guys have your phones? - Not all of us are rich like you. We don't have phones. - My parents are gonna be pissed. I totally forgot to leave a note. - Can take you back. - No, I'll be okay. Maybe reception will be better on the island. - Look. - Wow, that is ghetto. Here, lemme take pics on my phone then email them to you. The resolution is like 20 times as good. I mean you guys do have email, right? - Yeah, we have email. - I mean you guys don't like still talk to each other with coconuts attached to a string, right? - I'd like to see your phone. I wanna take pictures. - You crazy? - Sorry, accident. - Come on, man. That wasn't cool. - Whose back do you have? - You need to take me back now. - What you mean? We're getting close. - Stop the boat now. Take me back now! - Stop the boat! - Why? - Just stop it. Listen, I've been planning this trip for over a month now. I need to get what I need and turn it in by Sunday morning. - What is this all for anyway? - A contest, a chance to go on a trip with a bunch of other kids. We get to go to places and study the Iwa. We get to go to the Galapagos too. I read about it in the magazine my uncle gave me. I have a picture of the application, do you wanna see? - Why do you have a picture of it? - I read it every once a while to make sure I'm doing everything right. - My parents are gonna flip out and he owes me a phone. - We'll get you a phone. - How the hell are you gonna get me a phone when you two can't even get a phone for yourselves? - Guys, come on. Stop it. You guys have all next week to kill each other. Are we good? - Okay, but we need to go back early tomorrow. - Deal. Let's go to the backside of the island and look for the bird before the sun sets. We can set up the tent and stuff later. - You guys go, I'll set 'em up. - No, c'mon. - Poke it, break it. - Holy freakin' hot. Look they're wearing G-string. - That's a thong. - Shut up. Why are we not studying that instead of some stupid birds? - Hey, let's go. - You ever put inside? - Shoot, yes. My babysitter back at home. It was lit. - Oh whatever. Probably don't even have hair on your nuts yet and you're tellin' me you put inside. - What about you? Not yet, but I'll put my in both of those right now. Hey look, she heard me. Yeah baby, faster. Yeah baby, faster. - Why are some people like that? Storm's probably comin' soon. We should try and check the rocks again, but I don't know. I don't feel like great frigates come to this tiny island. It's too close to shore. If Uncle Pinok said might have, might have. That guy used to tell you when the rain going start and the rain going stop within five seconds. Now all he can talk is nonsense. - Don't say that. - Can you do a rain dance too? This place is so backwards. - Then go home, haole. - It's not like I wanted to move here. If I could go home, believe me I would. - So, what's Phoenix like? - Dry, busy. It almost never rains. Basically the opposite of this. - You ever been Disneyland? - Disneyland's in California. - I know. - Disneyland, Universal, Knott's Berry, Six Flags, tons of times. You guys haven't been? - I went Maui once for football. - I haven't been off-island. - So you ever see like famous people? - All the time. - Whoa, you know the Rock or Bruno Mars? Yeah, they're from Hawaii. - Bruno Mars is from Hawaii, not the Rock. His mom is the one from Hawaii. - Bruh, don't tell me who is and who isn't from Hawaii. - Whatever. - Haole. - What is that anyway, haole? - Foreigner or white person. - No, it's more than that. It's more than that. One haole's a person who talk just for talk, who likes the sound of their own voice. One person who makes you think the way they think, make you live the way they live, make you believe what they believe. - My dad always said it's a person without, without a soul. - Well an asshole is someone who throws someone's phone in the ocean. The definition is the same all over the world. - Sorry about your phone. - I gotta take a dump. - You're cool. Why are you friends with him? - Well my dad always said, "The best thing you can be in this world is an honest man. "Someone who's not ashamed of anything, "who can walk around with their head held high, "who has no shame." Kai's honest. He's like my brother. He's kind of a jerk. - When me and Kai were kids, his dad got arrested for stealing cars. His mom ended up hooking up with this asshole, that's Kai's stepdad. And that first New Year's, Kai was playing around and throwing firecrackers up in the air. One landed on the roof, the house caught on fire. And after the firemen came and put the fire out, Kai got the beating of his life. Then his stepdad locked him in a tool locker, like the same ones we have at school. - For how long? - Three days. Kai, he's always saying that him and his mom are waiting for his dad to come out and save them. - But? - Kai's dad's been out for over a year now. He hasn't come back and he's probably never coming back. - Shouldn't someone tell Kai? - Kai already knows. - The boat, it's gone! - No, it's right there. - Shit, you swim fast. Next time don't let the haole anchor the boat. - What? - An Iwa. It just landed on the bow. It was just looking at me. - No way. It's probably just an Alcatraz. - I saw it. - Dude, you know how rare they are? - Shut up. If he said he saw it, he saw it. Maybe it's a sign. - Yeah, maybe a voodoo witch doctor cast a spell. - Shut up! It's like the worst camping trip ever. I'll be grounded for a month because of this. - I'm so tired. I think I'm gonna go to the tent and dream about those girls we saw. Don't come with me. Only got room for me and my What are you going to do? - I'm gonna look for the birds on the rocks. - You got the feather already. If you go there, you'll just scare it away. - I can go by myself. No, I'll go. - Not that way. - Why? - That's a heiau, a sacred burial ground. - Like a graveyard? - Yeah, a long time ago. - So who is this Uncle Pinok you guys mentioned? - He used to live where your house is now. He was a kupuna, an elder. He knew more about this site than anyone else did. - What happened to him? - He got hurt at work, construction like my dad. Then he had bills, taxes on the house. He tried to sell laulau on the street, but making laulau's hard. Then he tried selling fruit, but it just wasn't enough. Then the bank kicked him out of his house. My dad let him stay with us for a bit. But after that, he just started losing it. Me and Kai used to go to his house all the time when we were kids. My parents was always working. - Mine too. - People used to think that I was his favorite or something because I was smart, but that wasn't it. - What was it? - Well after a while, I was the only one that went to his house. Even when he was all angry and stressed out, I was the only one who listened; especially at the end when whatever he said didn't make any sense. The Iwa can fly so high and so far. Nothing can touch it. - Yeah. - It's fearless, it's free. - Should we head back? - Yeah. Thanks for coming and putting up with him. - No problem. - Couldn't have done it without you. - You're the only family I got. Look, I caught a couple - Whoa. - We should cook one for breakfast. - Where's Jonah? - Hell if I care. Where's the camera? I wanna take a picture of the fish. - Jonah has it. - You trust him? - I got it. - Got what? - A picture of the bird. - He's lying. - Yes. Kai, you have to check this out. - I'll look later. Somebody has to clean the fish. - I'm gonna get out of here. Sorry, do you need help? - Nah. - No, it's okay. I'll help. You need help with scaling it? - Yeah. - What are you doing on my camera? - Nothing. Here. - Man, you can't go through people's old photos like that. - My bad. Look, we overslept. I spent too much time trying to get a picture of that dumb bird. It's like close to noon. We need to leave now. We gotta go, you guys promised. - Look, you're already in trouble. You might as well enjoy it. - No, he's right. We should go home. I'm kinda worried about Jenna. - Bruh, we're gonna be gone all summer. Jenna has to learn that you're not always gonna be there for her. - All summer. We got pictures. We even got a feather for his supposed scholarship. I need to go home. - What do you mean supposed? - You really don't know? - Know what? - Did you read the bottom of the application? Shoot, did you even read the-- - Shut up. - What is he talking about? - The scholarship is from like-- - Shut up! Keep your mouth shut. - There is no contest! There's no scholarship. - Shut up! - What? - I saw a picture of the application on his camera. The contest is from like two years ago. - Is that true? - "I read it every once in a while "to make sure I'm doing everything right." Good job, dummy. - Shut up! How come you're doing this? - I thought that maybe if I did better than everyone else, if I gave them the pictures and the feather, if I did anything I could, they'd let me go along. You, you dummy! You thought they would just give it to you? - Let's pack up and go. - You guys wanna try that thing? - No, I gotta go back. - Man, like I said you're in trouble already. I gotta teach you how to be bad. - Stop the boat. I wanna try. - I guess I'll have to show you boys how it's done. You're sure you don't wanna go next? - Nah, you go. - You sure now? Because I'm rusty and could use some lessons. - Just get in the fucking water. - Guys, watch this. - You okay? You sure? - I hate him. - You see now? - Whoa! - You're getting too close to the reef. Seriously, go more into the channel. - I know what I'm doing! - What the fuck? - Hey, relax. - Where did he? - Hey, haole boy! Haole! - What are you doing? - We gotta get outta here. - No, we got to find him. - Where? Where are we gonna find him? - We gotta do something. - I'm takin' us in. - What? No, we can't go in. I'm gonna go look again. What are you doing? - We don't say nothing. - That's stupid. We have to tell someone. - No. - It was an accident. I don't care what you say, I'm telling them. - So freaking stupid! And what, we end up boys in the jail just like my father? In case you never know, that was one haole with us. Not one Japanese, no no one Hawaiian. One haole, rich haole. You get the chair for somethin' like that. You hate him anyways. Look, you just tell them that we checked the boat and the motor was bust, so we decided to camp Koloa. - But what about the engine? - Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. - This is so wrong, so wrong. - Don't act good and honest now. Why you drag us out here in the first place? We're gonna be okay. - I'm not talking about us, I'm talking about him. - Look, you just gotta be calm. We go in, we say nothing. Just stick to the story. I know what it feels like to be trapped. You don't, I do. - I know what it feels like. - No, not really. Never learn your lesson, grow up. You're not Iwa birds. You cannot just fly wherever you like go. - They probably know. - No way. We should wait until they leave though. - Hey. - Shit. - What's going on? - We're just going house-to-house. We're looking for our son, Jonah. He's been missing since yesterday afternoon. His phone is off. I don't suppose you've seen him. Please tell me that you've seen our son. - No, we just got back from camping at Koloa. He wasn't around here. - I thought you was camping at Kapapa. - Oh, we changed our minds. - You're Kai, right? You're the one that got into an altercation with Jonah at school. - If altercation means scrap then yeah, we did. And even if I did see him, I wouldn't wanna hang out with him. - We're missin' a few things from the garage and one is an outboard motor. - Got plenty crazy this side. They steal whatever. They sell 'em for rocks and stuff. You should lock your stuff up. - I think these boys know more than they're tellin'. - Don't call my brother a liar. - Jenna, go to your room. - We should go. We can do this later. - Hey, I know you're scared about your boy. You be careful who you're accusing. - If it was your boy, would you worry about crossin' lines? - Get outta my house. Go sit down both of you. - Meet me at the bridge later. - When? - Sundown. - You boys being straight? - Yes, uncle. - Because I'm telling you right now, I'm not putting up with any lying. If you're bad, you own it! - We're being honest, uncle. - Don't be full of shit. - We know, uncle. - Don't bullshit me, boy. - Yes, uncle. We know. - Okay. Hey, where are you going? So what happened to the boat? - Nothing. Hold on. - Hey, open the door. I said open the freakin' door! David, get out now! We're not done yet! You better open this fucking door! Open the fuckin' door! Open the door! - No. - Why are you guys messing with him? He doesn't bother anybody. - Stay back. - What are you looking for? He's harmless. - Stay back! - All you can burn in hell. All of you haoles will burn in hell. - Uncle, uncle! - Are you related to him? - No! I mean, yes. I used to be. No! - Just stay back. - No, Pinok! Pinok. Pinok. - You know his name. - No, he's Mango Man. I mean, he's Pinok. Pinok, you know, he's my uncle. He didn't do anything. - Stay back. - He didn't do anything. - Stay back. He didn't do anything. - All of this. All this because of that stupid kid egging me on like that, making like he the man. Stupid haole. I knew you wouldn't tell. I know you not one rat. Wasn't my fault. - You put his shirt in his cart. - The boat is his boat. His name is under the registration, right? The haoles took his house. They took his ina. No one has more reason to hate the haoles than him. - Gosh, can you at least say his name? - No. You know, these fucking haoles they come from all over the place. Buy land, fix houses, walk around like they own the place; like it's their home, like they're the natives and we the guests. - You know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but now I have to. How could you just do that to uncle? - That's not him. The haoles killed Pinok. That's Mango Man. - It's wrong. - Wrong? Look at him. He lost his house. People like your dad tried to help him, but he kept getting worse. If I had that much help, I'll be on top of the world. But him, Pinok, even with all that help, he couldn't man-up 'cause he's weak. - That's the most haole thing you've ever said. - Bruh, grow up! You're in your dreams just like Pinok. Neither of you could see the real world anymore. - Don't even act like I'm the only one dreaming. Where's your dad, Kai? I know he's been out and I know that he doesn't wanna see you. - Take that back! - And Jonah, he was just a kid. Just a kid like us. - Shut up! - And that's Pinok, the same guy that taught us how to throw net, the same guy that taught us how to dive when you dad was out fighting and stealing. - Don't say that! - Who doesn't have a breath, Kai? Who doesn't have a soul? Is it Pinok? Is it the white people, or is it you? - C'mon, let's go! Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all! No matter how many houses they buy, I'm never leavin' this island! We're not birds, dummy. We cannot just fly wherever we'd like go. You like to be like them, right? The haoles. Then fuck the truth, do what they do! Lie, you fucker! Lie! Lie like them, you hear me? Lie like them. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all! You hear me? Fuck 'em all. - I've been there and there and there. I've been to Europe on my way to Desert Storm. I ever tell you about that, boy? London. - Really? How was it? - It was cold, it was gray. Freakin' sunshine for maybe two hours a day, if that. The buildings was old. I mean, not beautiful old like in the pictures, but old. When you see old in person, nothing can hide it from you. I thought I knew I was supposed to like it, but I hated it. - How long were you there? - Two days. You better tell me what happened, boy. And no bullshit. - It was all our fault. We took the boat out. It was an accident. I should told them what happened. I had so many times to tell them and now Uncle Pinok. - I heard. - He's gonna go to jail for something we did. - Stop fucking crying. Stop fucking crying! That's it, you be a man. You be a man. - I have to tell them. - You ain't telling them shit. - But-- - No, I don't wanna hear it. Pinok was one friend, one good friend. But do you think I'm gonna let you get yourself in trouble? You're my son. My son. It's done. You live with it, you eat it. This is our house, this is our family. Do you understand? It can be, boy. - Are you gonna help me feed them? - I can't. Today, I'm busy. - Please? Where are you going? - If you can't take care of them yourself, let 'em go. That Iwa bird is amazing. It can fly around the world without landing. It goes through clouds and travels through air streams high above the world, feeling the wind, spreading its wings, never landing, going anywhere, soaring free.
