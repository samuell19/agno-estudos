We have it. Bring it to me, without delay. And him? We finished him. For now. I see you. I’m bored. Do you remember when I first met you? Fitzherbert wanted to get rid of you. Hurt. Hurt me. And what did I do? You talked to him. And? You fought with him. And? And you broke his knee. And held him down, while I cut his heart out. How could I let him waste such talent? Such beauty. Johnson, what do you want done with the body? What? That doesn’t matter, you- He’s a sleeve walker, you have to move, fast. What are you doing? - We th- - No, leave the bag! We have to go now. No! We leave it and we walk. I’ll call you back. They say boredom is the desire for desires. Time to let you out to play again my pet. You’re not done yet. We need you to do one last thing. You have what you wanted, I’m done. And yet you’re still here. Give me my exit. I don’t know why they came after you, or what they wanted... ...but you still have a job. And get over yourself, It’s not like you have a choice. After this one, you can go, you have my word. It’s a delivery. Here’s the place, only to this man, no one else. Intact. Unhurt. Is there a problem? That’s not what I do. Since when do you even- One last time Clay. Remember, you’re close. Very close. Call me when she is safe. Safehouse, in case you need it. I’ll come to you when it’s done. And yes... I’ll bring it with me. Unhurt? By who? Something you need to stay away from. Hi. The waiting is over my darling, she’s out and alone. Go and get her for me. Ok! What would I do without you? See you soon. She was gone. She was close... and then gone. OOna, it wasn’t your fault. I know who took her from you. And I know who sent that... convict. The Boss? Come to me my pet, there’s more business to attend to and I need you with me. It’s fine. Leave her with me. Move! Who was it? I don’t know. Johnson! Johnson! You can always try. And I thought you wanted to make things easier for me? Yes, yes, our deal, I know. You’ll have them soon, especially her. And yet she’s nowhere to be seen. Soon- She was supposed to be the first one. She’ll be next, I know where she is! Do you now? She is being protected by a Sleeve Walker! But you’re here. And you’re one of them. You need me, I know where she is! You need me- No. I need her. Feed me. Early seven hundreds. I’m sure you remember that time fondly. I do. You should’ve been quicker. Mercurio, is that you? Oh, It’s definitely him. What are you doing? As soon as the Judges find out- Oh come on Athena, since when has that ever worked with me? You’re too late. She’s gone. And you think assigning one of those convicts to babysit her will keep her from me? Save us both some time and just tell me where she is. Did I stutter? Yes, I think you did, Johnson. I’ve dealt with his kind before. And how did that work out? He’ll get what he wants, he’ll stop being a pain. You want the Exit. Mercurio won’t give it up just like that. He always wants something in return. And I wonder what that might be? You know how it works. One of you dies, the rest get stronger. You better find her. That thing is not going to wait for you. Oh, I nearly forgot. As long as Clay is still with her- What? That you’re trying to buy time for them, is borderline pathetic. How much time do you think you have? More than you do. And here I was, thinking I could talk you out of your cunning plan. You thought wrong. OOna! Where is it? Johnson, Johnson! - Don’t make me ask again. Hey, we had a deal. I know that. The judges. They gotta go. Her death wasn’t enough. Can I have him? Impatience it seems crackles in the very air tonight! I’m a man of my word. They’ll know. Some of them won’t accept this. Then some of them will have to go. Listen, alright? You’re safe after that. The Exit’s right there- If I wasn’t trying to be a good example- And if she wasn’t so fond of you. They’ll get the message. You know, time’s running out for him. He’s gonna go for help. That’s why I need the Exit. Hey, don’t shoot the messenger buddy. He’s not gonna leave her alone now. Then I’ll make him. Priest, 7177. Who is this? This is Clay. Ah lad, I heard what happened. Did she... did she leave you something? Yes. Do you know what it means? I... I might. But there is my past, Clay. A past I don’t want to relive. And this- I need your help. I’m not longer what I used to be lad, you know that. Be that... be that as it may. I’m stuck here and you’re the only one I can trust. Ok. Tomorrow. You know where I am. One more thing. I’m not alone. Turn it off. Sleeve walker! Clay... Wait. Give me your phone. Only if you need to. Hey, Maya! What would you like today? The usual? Normal milk, right? Great, anything else? What would you like? Black. Two sugars. Alright, it will be a couple of minutes. You can nod, or shake your head. ‘Course. It’s already out of hand! Are you blind? Learza is... We don’t have anything that can stop it! We need to move quickly. We need a decision- And a decision has been made. How did you get here? You know, I love these little entrances. A testament to your enduring incompetence. I don’t have to listen to you and- Get to the point Johnson. Why are you here? Oh no, no, not my point... his! Hi ya judges! Sorry to interrupt your ‘who’s playing God’ time, but I’ve a message for you. I’m in charge now. And fron now on, there’s a new boss. Me! And you better keep those seats warm, cos it’s voting time. Let’s see who’s in.. And who’s out! How do you propose we do this vote? Oh, I’m well ahead of you. At this point, so is everybody! But before we seal the deal, a drink? To more efficient times. I haven’t got all day. See? I knew we could be reasonable! Clay, is that you? Ah, I knew it lad. Well... welcome! [Faint choral music, turbulent time. Do you know who did it? Mercurio, he did it. I never trusted that prick! Forgive me. She didn’t deserve to go that way. I know this fellow. He couldn’t do it by himself, he needed help. You sure it was him? He wasn’t there. What about her? It’s not my problem anymore. And you? I heard she was your last assignment, right? I believe you don’t have much time left. I don’t. I need my Exit. I want out. I know you do lad. but trust me, you’re never truly out. Sentences are payed. They leave scars. Scars that never heal. This is the symbol of the Nine. The little I know is too much to bear. It means darkness Clay, death. Since when were you afraid of death? It’s not what you think it is, it’s death for your soul. Done by a demon, that can take many forms. And it needs nine souls. Boss never told me about this. Ah lad, she has a soft spot for you. But she’s not your cross to bear. Whatever this is, stay away from it. You do know, right? I still can hear things. Even from here. Horrendous, murderous. Killing by fire. Burnt? Yes burnt. Their organs scorched. They must have felt how hell feels inside them. I don’t know much apart from where it happened one time, but- I have to go. I can’t stop you lad. By God I wish I could. I will look after her. And I will pray for your safe return. Don’t pray too long. ARES. Time, we don’t have it. You don’t have it. Come! Hello. You know, I’m handing you my life. Evening! You’ve been following me. Follow? Throughout the years many things have been following you, not me. Get it clear you were on my way. Come on Clay, be honest with yourself. I know what you’re after. How’d you- Because that’s why you’re still here. Why death is licking at your heels. Time is running out, not only for you. You’re on the right path, but you’re after the wrong thing. I’m done, I want my Exit. Far, far, far... You are far from done. You may repeat yourself, but that doesn’t make it any more true. Where is she? Who are you talking about? Open your eyes. She is- Yes, she is one of us. Only few of us are left, and death will be after her too. It’s not my- I can’t be part of this. Death is after me too, I’m done. But Maya stands a chance. There’s nothing left for me to choose. I can’t stay here. Nothing’s stopping you Clay, only you. But whatever’s left, save it. Before it’s gone. Now what? I’m going to send you out to play again, my pet. Bring her to me my sweet. Bring her to me. Hide! I really love what you’ve done with the place. Very you. Shit. I really liked that jacket. Ah, John, of all the places... here? Cael, I know who sent you. He didn’t give you a chance, but I do. Leave! It’s end of the road, John. End of the road. Johnny, John, John... Don’t be a fool. John’ was no more. John’ was not here. But today... Today... YOU FOUND HIM! To err is human. To forgive... divine. John, please... Please! It is easier to forgive an enemy, than a friend. But don’t worry... You were never my friend. You and your toys. Enjoying yourself? Life’s short, man. Yes, for some. I have a favour to ask. Hey, where’s that pet of yours? I have a surprise for her. That’s a very beautiful hand, my dear. I assume you like it attached to your body? It’s Clay. I need you to keep him distracted. He eluded your people! Let me... Let me handle it. Keep him occupied. For a while. I thought you wanted him ‘out’? Power has dulled your edge, Mercurio. There’s a big difference between what I want, and what’s going to happen. So long. Oh Maya, Maya, Maya... Let’s make this easier for everyone, shall we? Let’s make this easier for everyone, shall we? Oh, no no no... not now, my pet. OOna... please. I need you to do something for me. Mercurio! Yes... I need you to check on that ‘man.’ He should’ve be done with the convict by now. Ok! Try not to look too happy about it! The Sleeve Walker? Forget him. Who sent you? Mercurio! OOna... please... please... Tell him! OOna... OOna... just tell him! No-no... Please- Shit! Ah! Just tell him! Just tell him already! Please! Where is he? My darling pet- I know where you are. I could pay you a visit. What have you done with her? Or you can just meet me. What a surprise. Clay, right? We’re really still playing that game? Predictable. Still, I know what you’re really here for. Here- Now time is running out, and something needs feeding. Good! Good choice. Are you delusional? I gave you a chance, take it! You’re wasting my time! Oh bunny, bunny... Smells good- Maya.
