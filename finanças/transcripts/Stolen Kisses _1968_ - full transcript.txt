STOLEN KISSES Stolen Kisses is dedicated to Henri Langlois' Cinémathèque FranГ§aise François Truffaut MUSEUM OF CINEMA What time is it? Ten to 4:00. What time is it now? Nine to 4:00. Up yours, queer! Eight to 4:00. Where's Doinel? THE LILY OF THE VALLEY Here I am. Why? Let's go. Can I take a leak? Not till 6:00. Lousy fink bastard! You shouldn't have hit that guard. Doinel, pee for us. Get laid for us! At 5:00 sharp. We'll think of you at 5:00. Wait for me here. Private Doinel is here. You probe the ground with your bayonet. And you think, "Ah, I feel something hard!" That's what your girl says when you're home on leave. Well, mines are like dames. You have to go gently. With a girl, you don't feel her ass right away. You fiddle around. With a mine, it's the same thing. Study it while I'm gone. Well, you finally made it. It's just as well, for you and for us. Some individuals are hopeless. They just clutter up the army. Here's your record. Private Antoine Doinel, enlisted for three years, discharged from the army as unfit for service. There are boys who don't like the army. They're drafted and they serve. But they don't volunteer! Why did you enlist? I had personal reasons. A girl, naturally! The army is no refuge. What's more, you've spent your enlistment bonus. They should make you give it back. I would. You must have pull. Communist friends. They run everything nowadays. Assigned to Vidauban. AWOL. Sent to Strasbourg. AWOL. Confined to barracks at Dupleix. AWOL. You're always AWOL. You are like Jean de Nivelle's dog that runs off when it is called, aren't you? And you had your civvies stolen. You'll have to send your uniform back. Honourable discharge denied by order of the General himself. Which means you can never work for the government or any respectable company. You can always peddle ties... But I doubt that you'll sell many. Good luck. I hope we never meet again. Dismissed! You have to pay for the room! It's 8 francs. Ginette got picked up again. Leave her something. That's the third time. We'll bring her sandwiches. Not me! - Not on the mouth! - Why? Never with customers. Don't! I've got spray on. I'll keep it on. I've got a cold. Come here. I'll wash you. Where are you going? I'm always at the Balto. If I'm not there, just wait 10 minutes. How about Saturday? Okay, fatso. You going in or out? I don't know. I'll follow you. You're my first soldier today. You'll bring me luck. What are you in? I was in the artillery. Great! I love big guns! What a surprise! Come in! Won't Lucien be surprised! How's... Lucien, look who's here. Long time, no see. Are you on leave? No. Discharged. - Have you eaten? - Yes. Don't bother. I'm sure you haven't. Sit down. Too bad Christine's not here. Did you get sick? Is it temporary? No. Permanent... Psychologically unfit. That works even in wartime. Good for you! The army is like the theatre, a wonderful anachronism. We never knew why you enlisted. Oh, Lucien, it is none of your business. I'd read Military Servitude and Greatness, and I believed it. And now you're looking for a job? I'd like to find something. What about Shapiro? The Hotel Alsina. You're right! I'll call him. He's a customer. He has a hotel in Montmartre. His night watchman just died. Would that suit you? It'd be fine. You wanted to see Christine. I'll call her tomorrow. No. She's gone skiing with some friends for a week. The conservatory is closed down. There's a new dean. The students preferred the old one. So they're out on strike. It's Mr Shapiro. I heard you mention Christine. What did you tell him? The truth. What should I tell him? That's all right. He told me to come over right away. I think I'd better go now because... Before you finish your cheese? Go ahead. Being a night watchman isn't bad. You have time to read. And Shapiro is a nice guy. I'll tell Christine you're back. Hello, Christine. Hello, Antoine. I'm glad to see you. You haven't changed. - So you got out? - Finally. That's what my parents said. Did you just get home? I came right over. Do you like it here? It's peaceful. My parents were afraid you'd catch cold. They sent this. Vitamins. It's nice of you, but... Take some now, or you'll forget. Do you want something to drink? What is there? Anything. Mineral water, Coke... A Coke. I didn't think I'd see you again. You haven't written for six months. I was usually in jail or in the hospital. And at first, when I wrote, you didn't answer very often. Yes, I did! But you wrote so many letters. Once I counted... I got 19 in one week. I wondered when you found time to write. So did I. And they weren't all so nice. What's your day off? Wednesday. Come to dinner. Mother said to ask you. You bet. Absolutely. Positively. Has Mrs Colin come down yet? I haven't seen anyone. I was supposed to meet her at 6:00, and I'm late myself. We'll miss our train to London! The boat won't wait for us. Didn't she ask you to wake her? You're half asleep yourself! Let me see it. 6:00, Room 18. 6:15... There! Room 24. Let's go. Take your key. I know her. She probably took a sleeping pill. Hurry up! - What floor? - Third. If we miss that train, we'll miss the boat. Open the door. She takes sleeping pills. Turn the light on. Julien, what are you doing? Your husband? None of my business. Julien! This is too much! My mother was right! You're pathetic! Hopeless! Just look at yourself... No, no... Not that way! What's the point? We've got to be noisy. Now, go on! You're crazy! Not the flowers! The vase! That's great! Keep it up! Go call the police. He's breaking everything! He's crazy! Call the cops! Say it's an emergency! Tell them it's serious. They'll get here faster. Very good. Fire department? No! The cops! Dial 17. This is for you. Buy some candy. Hello, police? This is the Hotel Alsina. On the third floor. Say they're breaking everything. They're breaking everything. Keep it. What's going on? A man just found his wife... The lady in Room 24 was with Room 19. You let him in! He told me to hurry. You're a private detective! Get out of here! You, too! Here's your bonus. And this is for Christmas. What'll you have? I just ordered. You pulled a fast one! Are you a private detective? I've been with the Blady Agency for 30 years. Haven't you seen the ads on the phone book covers? You didn't see me at the hotel last night. But I was there. When Mrs Colin and her lover went upstairs, I knew they'd be in bed together. All I needed was proof. Why didn't you call the cops then? They wouldn't have come. My client would have had to appeal to the district attorney. The DA would have called the police. They come and what do they do? The cops note that at a certain time, they saw a Mr Colin go into a hotel room and assault two persons in the same bed, one of the persons being the wife of said Colin. Generally, the cops only come for disturbance of the peace. But in this case, we got official proof of adultery. - Not bad! - It's a job. I've got to go. I had a phone call to make. Oh, I'll do it at the office. Hey, you lost your job, didn't you? Where's Mother? The trains are on strike till tomorrow. But the table is set for three. Look who's behind you. I thought you were coming Wednesday. He left the hotel. He got fired. - So he's looking for a job? - No, I've got one. What's he doing? You'll never guess. - A newsboy? - Better than that. - A porter at Orly? - That takes pull. - A painter? - That takes talent. A writer? No money in that. A water taster? It's a good job. I saw one on TV. No. Less tiring. A cab driver? You're getting warm. - A poet? - No. Even worse. Worse? Less intellectual. More dangerous. - I give up. - I said dangerous. Shall I give you a hint? Does he use a gun? No. A spyglass! I give up. I'll give you a hint. - Sheriff? - Sure. Didn't you see his horse outside? I'm a private detective! Yeah. Antoine Bond, FBI. You know the Blady Agency? All kinds of investigations. Oh, that's great! I want to hear about it. Come and help me. I can't stay long. I'm meeting some friends. Do you mind? You're sure, now? I don't mind at all. If you did, would you tell me? No, I would not. But I don't really mind. I'll make you sing. I'm no canary. I object, Your Honour. Anything you say may be held against you. Catherine, you did a good job in London. But why all that room service? The London Hilton is at an angle. And I covered both doors from my window. What's new on the textile case? The salesgirl doesn't take anything out. We've tailed her for three weeks. She can't conceal anything in her coat and her bag's too small. She's no thief. We'll drop it. I have a hunch. I think her boss made it all up. He's in love with her and was looking for some way to get to her, and he didn't dare tell me the truth. Like the guy at the Ministry three years ago. But he came to a bad end. Yeah. He hanged himself. No, he shot himself. He hanged himself from a beam in the attic of the Ministry. Hanging doesn't make your brains splatter. With the belt of his bathrobe. You always want the last word, Henri. I argued with your father when you were in knee pants. Doinel, you stay. My father had lots of patience. But mine is limited. Limited is right! Mr Albani is here. Show him in. You wait there. - You're waiting for the boss? - Yes, I am. Come and sit down. It's about a friend who lived with me. A month ago, he disappeared. He left some things and I'd like to return them. You want his address? Yes, but not only that. I'd like to know how he lives. What he's doing, whom he sees. I understand. We'll find his address, tail him, and investigate. It will cost you 300 francs a day. Fine. Will it take... Very long? It depends on whether your friend, the gentleman, is hard to find or not. What is his profession? He's a magician. He does an act with coloured cords. I always do the puzzle. Bring your book. I'll get on it right away. Call me in a few days. Is Doinel there? Are you sure that you know yourself? Because I need to understand you. Just bear in mind that we are not the FBI. We never impersonate police inspectors. We use initiative and cunning. Our job is 10% inspiration, 90% perspiration. Over there, every Thursday they serve salt pork and lentils. - I came to see Christine. - She's out. Come in and have some coffee. Shall I come tonight? No. I said Saturday. Or never, if that doesn't suit you. Saturday's fine. You look upset. What's wrong? Catherine is impossible! She refuses to get married! I've been after my girl for two years, and I know it won't work. Why not get yourself a whore? They're too filthy. At your age, I ate French fries in the street and laid slobs who used safety pins on their bras. But now, I can't take them. I've got a date with a real tall girl. What do you do when a girl is taller than you are? Nothing special. I mean a tall, tall girl. When you go out, if she's too... Just look professional! How did it go, with the girl? At first, it was depressing. But later on, it was fantastic! The walls shook. It was real wild! When my grandfather died, I was sad, and my cousin cried like crazy. There was a big family dinner. Right after dessert, we went to the attic, and I laid her on the floor. If anybody had found us, it would have seemed monstrous. Yet, to make love is a way of compensating for death, of proving you exist. Christine will be here soon. Are you going to an early show? No, we're going to a nightclub for a case I'm on. It must be fascinating! It is. For instance, today, a woman asked us to find out why her twin babies seemed so pale when their nursemaid takes them out for fresh air every day. Since she goes to work, she can't follow the nurse. Well, they had me tail her, and this afternoon, I waited in front of her apartment house. The nurse came out with the twins. She took them to a little park and I followed them. Where's that thing? Oh, you came for Christine. What happened in the park? She rushed right through it, came out the other end. She went into a building. She left the twins with the concierge in a filthy room. Then she came out, crossed the street and went into a strip joint, where she did the "nursemaid strip." She took off her uniform and did things with the baby's bottle. And since it was a continuous show, she did an encore 15 minutes later. Then she went back to the concierge's to pick up the twins. She tipped the concierge and took them home. No wonder they looked sickly! I made out my report and called it in to the office. Fantastic! Have you been here long? At least two hours. What are you looking for? I can't find Langman's address. I want to send his wife some flowers. Call him. We have his phone number. And what do I say? "Give me your address so I can send you flowers." You've got his phone number but not his address? Langman, 525-5573. That's simple. Leave it to me. What are you doing? Is this 525-5573? Mrs Langman? If I say, "Chiquita," what do you answer? Banana! You just won five bunches of bananas! What address shall we send them to? 6 rue Ribera. Fine. And congratulations! That was brilliant! One of the tricks of the trade. Are we going to the movies? No, I've got to go to a nightclub. On a case. It's a nice place. There's a show. Do you mind? No. If it's light, you'll behave better than at the movies and I'll have some peace. There was an old sailor, a magician and a storyteller... He was ageless and still today, a living legend. Children would crowd around him on the wharf. As he played with braided cords, he told them strange tales. He had all kinds of cords, all lengths, all colours. White and red, green and yellow. Orange and wine, purple and blue... Do you remember the old sailor when he'd say nothing? He'd pretend not to see us, but we saw him under the moon of June. He'd roll up the gold cord and put it down. Then, as if he were performing a sacred ritual, as if he were seeking... Who knows? A lost science... Slowly, we'd see him knot the blue cord, wind it around his hand, and the knots would go from the blue cord all by themsleves over to the gold cord. And from the gold cord, back to the blue cord. And he was happy. And no one paid any attention to his story. As soon as he wound the blue cord on his hand, the knots would go from the blue to the gold. Then back again, to the blue. Once again the knots would go from the blue cord to the gold cord. Excuse me. I've got to go. It's for my job. I must kiss you! Albert, you remember Antoine? Albert, my husband. What are you doing here? Waiting for a friend. You're wondering if it's a boy or a girl. You must come to dinner some night. Do you have my phone number? I think so. You haven't called lately. You didn't used to be afraid of the phone. See you soon. I'm calling because I left you in sort of a hurry. I hope you're not mad. It was for my job. I had to tail a guy. You know, the magician. You're not angry? No. You detectives... You say that. But you sound... A little resentful. No. Not at all. We could go out tonight, or do something. I'd like to. So would I. But I'm a little tired. I went to the demonstration. With cops and clubs and everything? You know Marie? She got hit. They're terrible! Her father is suing the police. Don't cut us off, miss! I can't hear you, Christine. Something's wrong with this line. Don't you put that dirty paper on my windshield! These pieces of paper are not clean. It is not acceptable. "6:55, they close the post office. "6:58, the subject has not reappeared. "7:04, operation suspended." According to this, the subject spent the night in the post office! You must be kidding! I lost him. The magician made himself disappear! What kind of club does he work at? Kind of an arty place, with candles on the tables and Vivaldi in the toilets. What statue are you referring to? He makes all his appointments at a statue of Joan of Arc. An equestrian statue? Mr Tabard is here. Show him in. I'm sure the magician spotted you. I'll have to put someone else on it I don't know what to do with you. You're certainly willing, but you discourage me. You can leave now. I may as well be frank. I have no special reason for coming. People don't usually come here out of curiosity. Are you married? Yes, very happily. To a superior woman. No problem there. I'm in good health. Delighted to hear it. Your profession? Oh, the store is doing fine. We double our profits every year. What store? My shoe store. Shoes for men, women and children. Especially children. Everybody needs shoes, right? And with traffic jams, more people are walking. Then you're a happy man, with no cares, no enemies. Not without enemies. Ever since my childhood, in college and in the army, people have been jealous of me. Not that it keeps me awake. And I have one failing... I'm frank! I see what you mean. But I don't understand why you're here. What do you want from me? Well, nobody loves me, and I want to know why. I know what you'll say. I should see an analyst. It's not that I can't afford one. But I can't waste time telling my life story on a couch! I'm not a mamma's boy! And my store keeps me busy. A shoe salesman's work is never done! If you feel everyone hates you, it may be that you look down on people. Oh, no! Certainly not! Anyone can buy shoes at Tabard's. Jewish women, Arabs, even Chinese women... As long as they wear high heels, of course. I feel that I'm despised. But I don't know by whom. I can sense it all around me. In restaurants, at the movies, at prize fights. My concierge, for instance, when I speak to her, she shrugs. And my wife laughs all the time, except when I tell a joke. And my salesgirls... They're the worst. Whenever I comment on their work, they talk back, they argue. Do you have any friends? Not one. Luckily, I don't need any. If I did, I couldn't make any. How many salesgirls do you have? Four, plus the cashier. We could start our investigation in your store. I could install a periscope. I'll show you. Send Doinel in. Right away, sir. Antoine, Mr Blady calls for you. He said right away. This isn't my day! You know what my father said when I left home? "Be respectful to your boss!" Here's our periscope. Mr Tabard, let me introduce you to Antoine Doinel. You can leave us now, Doinel. He's young. Yes. But brilliant. Send him in on Monday. I'll hire him. Oh, no! That wouldn't work. No one must suspect you know each other. Place an ad, "Stock boy wanted." You eliminate the others and you hire him. You have everything you need? Start when I say go. One, two, three, go. Show me your packages. This one's fine. We'll hire him. How's everything? Fine. I'm working in a shoe store. I'm fine, too. You know my TV scripts? I took them to the head men. They liked them. They're interested. I'm sure they'll take them. So I'm fine. Is there a restaurant around here? Eat with us. Is there something planned? Usually we all bring something. I don't want to bother you. We'll manage. Help me set the table. Say, the boss, Mr Tabard, I like him. You don't know him! He's a dinosaur! You're not going till you find those Louis XV shoes. They never arrived. They're not on my slips. Didn't you learn anything in school? The factory confirms they fixed the shanks and returned them. You signed the receipt. I signed lots of papers today. I don't know where they are. The customer paid for those shoes! I've looked in all the unmarked boxes. Well, they're in the wrong box. Fan all the stacks till you find them. I want those shoes first thing tomorrow! You shouldn't be here. The store is closed. If all the customers did that... They'd all be Fabienne Tabard. I'm the boss's wife. Oh, I apologise. It's all right. You only do your job. You're the new boy? What do you think of these? Too shiny for the dress. You're right. Go get me a pair like these with black satin toes. Size 4.5. Understood? Mr Tabard is impatient, as usual. Will you answer it? I don't understand. It's in English. Would you mind taking this up to the apartment? Do you know how to lock up? You work awfully late. On the Cinderella case... The employees call Mr Tabard "the dinosaur". I met Mrs Tabard. Her voice is enchanting, and she speaks English. Describe her. She's superb! A little vague and very gentle. She has an adorable turned-up nose. Her size? Slender. I mean, how tall is she? 5'5" without heels. What shape face? A pure oval, slightly triangular. Luminous skin, lit up from within. We want a report, not a declaration of love! What do you mean, hounding me at the store? Well, you never call, and you're never home. My parents were worried about you. Tell them hello for me. There's no reason to be so nasty. No reason, huh? If I did anything, just tell me. Oh, nothing at all! I thought I was your friend. You can keep your friendship! So we're back to last year. No! Much farther back. And whose fault is it? Nof mine! I can't remember all your letters, but you once wrote... "Now I know I feel nothing but friendship for you." - Did you write that, or not? - That's what I thought then. But love and friendship call for admiration. Well, I don't admire you! Even when I thought I loved you, I didn't admire you. - It's true. - Goodbye then. And look at this poor dear Mr Tabard. I don't want to go alone. Get Antoine to take you. I wouldn't mind. I've got a real crush on him. But he's crazy about Mrs Tabard! The other clay, Sylvie called her "Mrs Dinosaur." Antoine was furious! He said, "She's an exceptional woman!" Then he said, "She is not a woman. She's an apparition!" Haven't you noticed? When she appears, he turns white as a sheet. No, not that stack. Look in the green boxes on top. They're empty. Higher. Do I have tomorrow off? No. Do I leave early today? No. Do you want to hear a story? No. The one about the moron who said no... Well, it's you! Come with me. It's like that all the time. How's your investigation going? I can't say. I make my report every night. Mr Blady analyses them. If you want more details... Who gives the biggest cheques to the Shoe Defence Fund? Yours truly. You're late, Georges. Everything's cold. It doesn't matter. I'll just have some cheese. The girls get the boxes mixed up. I'll give the accounts to Antoine. - Have you had lunch? - Yes. Downstairs. With the girls? There's one book missing. Sit down. I'll give it to you later. Do you like cheese? This one's perfect. It stinks beautifully! I'd rather have a yogurt. Dick and Janet called. I told them to call the store. They're taking their first French lesson. Do you speak English? I'm studying with records, but it's not very easy. Records are a joke! You can only learn English in bed, with an English girl. It's time you got started. I learned with an Australian. Her husband was a house painter. Like Hitler. Don't ever say that! It's slander. Hitler was a landscape painter. What am I doing? The one I need is in the car. Wait for me, Antoine. I'll do it. Are you coming? - Do you like music? - Yes, sir. What's wrong, Antoine? I'm sick! - Where are you going, Antoine? - I'm going home. Where's the new boy, Antoine? He went home, sick. May I see the book, please? No, the personnel record. Give me a word to use in place of "say." I've used it 10 times already. Confide, state, relate, affirm... You sure know a lot. But I'll stick to "say." Mrs Tabard really keeps me on the run. But I've got a clue. She has a lover. She does not! She's above all that! I saw her buying three ties at Cardin's. Tabard doesn't wear them. That's right. He wears bow ties. I'm going to ask Mr Blady to put me on another case! I must talk to you. Not now. Mr Albani is here. Can't you wait five minutes? No, it's urgent! I'll see you in a little while. So, everything's fine? We've been lucky in your case. We aren't always. We shadowed your friend, the magician, Robert Espannet, 35. He's been doing his act at the Golden Horse since last September. His address is 42 rue de la RГ©publique. He moved because his wife was pregnant. His wife? He was married on November 12th. You must be mistaken! No. The marriage contract was drawn up by Lebaudet. You're a dirty liar! Give me that! Go get the dentist upstairs! There's a crazy guy in our office! Take him home. No, I can't face it. He left all his things there! You have to go somewhere. I'll go to a hotel. Put him in a cab and take him home. You must be real proud of yourself. I hope he paid in advance. One of my teachers once explained the difference between tact and politeness. A man opens a bathroom door by mistake and sees a naked lady. He steps back and says, "Excuse me, madam." That's politeness. The same man finds the same naked lady and says, "Excuse me, sir." That's tact! I know why you ran away, Antoine. Until tomorrow. "For the past hour, "I've been looking at the ties, "which I would never dare to wear. "This is a farewell letter. "You are generous, and I don't deserve your generosity. "You will never see me again. I'm quitting my job. "I'm an impostor of the worst kind. "I dreamed that a feeling might exist between us. "But that is as impossible as Felix's love "for Madame de Mortsauf. "Farewell." Pneumatic. I woke you up. I was awakened very early, too, by your letter. But it doesn't matter. It's a pleasure to wake up and read something lovely. I sat down to answer it. But I realised that I had to come here right away, myself. I've read The Lily Of the Valley. I'm like you. I think it's beautiful. But you forgot one thing. Although Madame de Mortsauf loved Felix, it is not a beautiful love story. It's terribly sad, for she died because she couldn't share her love with him. Besides, I'm not an apparition. I'm a woman, which is the opposite. For example, this morning before I came, I put some make-up on, I powdered my nose, I made up my eyes. And as I came across Paris, I noticed that all the women had done the same thing. For their pleasure, or that of others. You say that I'm exceptional. It's true. I am exceptional. Every woman is exceptional in turn. You, over there, you're exceptional, too. Your fingerprints are unique. You are unique. We're both unique and irreplaceable. Before he died, my father beckoned to the doctor and said, "People are wonderful!" Then he died. You don't need to talk. But I wish you'd look at me. You wrote me yesterday. And the answer is... Me. I propose a contract which is fair to both of us. Since we both like what is exceptional, I'll come close to you, now. We'll spend a few hours together, and then, whatever happens, we'll never meet again. Do you agree? I'll take the key out of the lock. In the stories we both like, the lady throws the key out the window. But this vase will do very well. Surprise! This morning, Mrs Tabard, who never gets up before 11:00, went out at 8:15. I followed her to 18 Square d'Anvers, where she stayed an hour and a half. Then she went home. Whose apartment did she go to? I don't know. There are a lot of apartments. The concierge wasn't there, but I'll go back. I know where she was. I have to see you alone. Leave me with him. I hate to bother you. I'm the high school principal. I need some information about one of your teachers, Miss Dupuis. Oh, nothing important, just some details about her life, her morals. I'm on a new case. What am I going to tell Mr Tabard? That he paid 2,000 francs for that? Is it real hair? Not bad, huh? What's happening? I'll call Mr Blady. Hang up. Mr Henri is dead. For a little more, I'll strip. Here. But keep your clothes on. You can stay longer then. I don't want to. That jerk! Put your brakes on! What are you doing now? I'm a TV repair man. No, no... It was my fault. I can think of better ways to find you. But no harm done. Have a nice weekend. - Don't you want to come with us? - No, I have to study. You're too serious. You can always call Lucienne. I won't be lonesome. I'll watch TV. Don't stay inside all weekend. SOS 9999? Could you come to 44 Ave Г‰douard Vaillant? The TV doesn't work at all. Breakdown service Oh, it's a Serene Voice! Who took this out? That's funny. It's like in a cab. Please! Let me work in peace! That's not the way to do it! I'll teach you something, how to butter it without breaking it. You take two pieces, like this. You spread the butter, and the top one will never break. I'll teach you everything I know. And you'll teach me what you know. It's not very important. Yes, it is, but I'd rather write it down. Have you got a pencil? I forgot my handkerchief. Will you lend me yours? All I've got is Kleenex. No thanks. I never use paper! Don't look now... There's a strange guy. I think he's been following me. I don't know who he is. - Who is he? - I don't know. Here he comes. I know I'm not unknown to you. For a long time, I watched you in secret. But now I've stopped hiding. I know that the time has come. Before you, I'd never been in love. I hate the temporary. I know all about life. I know that everyone betrays everyone. But you and I will be different. We'll never leave each other, not for a single hour. I have no work. I have no obligations in life. You will be my sole preoccupation. I understand. I realise this is all too sudden for you to say yes at once, that you must first separate from some temporary people. I am definitive. I am very happy. The man's really mad! He must be. THE END
