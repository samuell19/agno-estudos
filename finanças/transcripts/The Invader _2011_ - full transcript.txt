Come on, hurry up! Quickly! Out! Siaka... It's me. It?s only me. Do you want some water? Amadou. I'll be okay. - l know. Hey you, come here! Siaka, rest a bit. I?ll be back. Your friend, he can't stay here in that condition. He needs a doctor. A doctor? What do you think? No one comes here. No one! He needs treatment. - This isn't a station hall. He needs treatment. - Yeah... I?ll see what l can do. But if he doesn't get better... I?ll get rid of him. Don't you dare touch him. He has the right to stay here. l work for two. Amadou... Are these logs yours? The logs... - No. Do you want these? What for? - It?s firewood. Everything's gas now. Gas... No, wait, it's good. - No, l don't want it. Want a cigarette? - Yeah. Do you need some wood? Sir? Five euros for this firewood. Do you want it? Five euros. How much? - Five euros. Five euros? Here. - Thank you! Good night. Can l help you? Do you have something to treat a fever? Is it for you? - It?s for a friend. Has he seen a doctor? We don't know any doctors here. I?ll give you a painkiller, it'll help. Here. Thank you. It?s a Health Centre. Consultations are free. Thank you. Do you need anything else? - No. Do you have any work for me here? - Work? Yes, like cleaning... the shop, or... l also know a lot about traditional African healing products. l don't think we can use that knowledge in this pharmacy. It?s me. Where the fuck were you all day? l was at the swimming pool. What did you do? Where is Siaka? Sia-who? - Siaka. l want to see Omar. Go ahead. Where is Siaka? You and your friend asked me to provide you with all your documents. Residence permit, passport... l had to advance the money. Four thousand euros. Four thousand euros? Now what do l say to the people who provided me with those documents? That the other nigger has gone? Who will reimburse the money l advanced for the two of you? l didn't know. No one ever told me it costs four thousand euros. Didn't your friend like it here? He just left, without saying goodbye. He's taking the piss... - He couldn't leave. He was sick! l took you in. l found you board and lodging. l even found you work. Do you realise what l risk by protecting clandestines like you? You owe me four thousand euros. Wanna get laid, negro? Maybe that's why he's so nervous. Do you want to fuck her? You deserve it, don't you? You've been working for two, right? You're nothing here. Nothing. So be very careful. You're crazy! - Crazy? Want to know if I'm crazy? Want to know?! l have a project to build on that land. The police were on the site. You're going to create many problems for me with your trade in illegals. Pay me more and my work will be as clean as your hands. It?s my fault. l should never have trusted you. Take the money, and don't thank me. l never want to hear from you again. l still remain at your service. Our collaboration ends here. You're nothing but an amateur. My lawyer will call you. You're nothing but a crook. Take a right. Then left at the end of the street. Here? Left? - Yes, left. Right. Are we following that taxi? Who's in that car? My wife. - Your wife? We're following your wife? - Yes... You have a problem with that? - No. lf you're following your wife in a taxi, you have the problem. Is it finished? No, not yet. Not interested anymore? No, l mean yes. l just needed some fresh air. It?s long, l understand. Have you been here since this morning? - Yes, l didn't miss a thing. It?s fascinating. - Well done. You're beautiful. l beg your pardon? You heard me. Thank you. Charles de Yaele, the speaker, he's my husband. Your husband? - Yes. l love his voice. He seems so calm. I?ll tell him that. He'll be pleased. You are very attractive. It?s the truth. Agnes, is everything okay? Yes, I?m okay. - It?s over. Will you introduce me to your friend? Oh, sorry. Mr...? Obama. Obama... Mr Obama attended Charles' conference. He loves his voice. He's a handsome man. Shut up. Kris Laureyns, Agnes' associate. l didn't notice you in the room. l was hidden in the dark... Let's go, we're going to be late. - See you soon. See you soon. - Bye. Hello? Hello? There. l couldn't hear you. It?s me. Amadou. l arrived safely and in good health. We've been here four months now. As you know... Hello? Okay... Can you hear me? l have a bad news to give you. Siaka has passed away. He is no more. It?s difficult. It is God's will. Please make sure his family is told. l tried my best, but l couldn't help. He was very ill. I've got that melody stuck in my head. Remember the one you sang? l did it on purpose. How was last night? Either way, they'll try to get round our offer. Just do what you always do, Agnes. l like these little black ones. Hello? Yes. Right now? Okay. Yes, one moment please. I?ll explain later. Do we have an appointment? - No. We absolutely needed to see each other. Was that you on the phone with Kris? You're a naughty boy, Mr Obama. Kris is going to be terribly disappointed. You are very desirable. You seem very sure of yourself. Agnes, I?ve never felt so brave, so strong. l almost want to believe you. l want you so much. Are you in a hurry? Now? Yes, now. What are you thinking about? About now... What do you do for a living? I?m in real estate. But l also sell works of art. Is this your place? - Yes, but l don't live here. It?s a loft l lend to friends visiting. Is there a woman in your life? No, you're the only one. Agnes de Yaele invites you to a drink in honour of a Huang Tsen exhibition Are you okay? - Yes. When can we see each other again? - l don't know. You don't want to see me again? No, that's not it. l just need some time to think about things. Leave me your number, I?ll call you when things are clearer for me. What's your number? - My mobile phone was stolen. Give me your home phone number. Or at the office. Don't you work? Yes, yes, but we're moving out, we're looking for new offices. And what is it you do, Mr Obama? Import and export. Import and export. - That's right. Isn't that a bit vague? Right now we're trading with the States. Actually, if you know people who want to work with me... l don't know. - You know a lot of people, right? I?m a serious man, you can trust me. l have so much energy, sometimes l don't know what to do with it. Are you looking for work? - No, no, not at all. I?ve got lots and lots of work. I?m looking for contacts. lf you see what l mean. - Of course. I?ve got to go now. Agnes! Silence is complicity Hunger strike, Day 7 Hello. Mrs Agnes de Yaele, please. It?s me. How are you? Yes. Agnes, we have to meet again. I?ve also thought about things and I?ve got important things to tell you. Yes, Agnes, l understand... but we absolutely have to meet again, even if it's just one more time. No, not tomorrow, tonight. l mean, today. Today, Agnes, l insist, today. Fine. Me too. Come here. Are they looking for me? - l don't know. Anyway, l don't give a damn... You hear me? l don't give a damn! My life has completely changed. l have a woman, a woman from here. She loves me and we're going to live together. You can tell them that! Give me that! May l sit here? Please excuse her, but Agnes is not going to come. She didn't want to make you wait here for nothing. She doesn't have anything against you. She wanted to tell you this personally, but... right now, the situation is extremely complicated. So don't blame her, okay? You have the keys to the loft, don't you? The number appeared when you called the office. The keys, please. Thank you. Agnes thought you might need a little help. To help you out... Five hundred. Is that enough? Do you know where to sleep tonight? l can put you up, for a night or two. Just to help you out... Goodnight. Come here! Do you have a cigarette? It will be wonderful. Because everytime I see a wheatfield I?ll think about you. Because you have the colors, hair colored like wheat. Then he kills himself. And he looked at the little prince for a while. Please. Are you angry? That's understandable, I?ve done some strange things. All this has gone too far. I?ve got so much to offer... Hello. - Mrs de Yaele? Your friend is waiting for you. Mr Obama? What are you doing here? l don't want a scandal. Please, leave. l don't want a story like this. Agnes, l need help. You lied to me. You stole my keys and went to my home. l didn't know where to go. You scared the hell out of me last night. Sorry. Enough! What do you want? What is it you're looking for? l don't know anyone here. l can't help you. l don't know who you really are. Take this. Agnes. - Please. Please. - So this is how it is now? l don't want to see you anymore. Do you understand? Sir! - I?m nothing to you? Is that it?! Excuse me, sir. - Am l nothing to you?! Calm down, sir. - Agnes! Agnes!
