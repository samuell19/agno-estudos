--== McEphie ==-- [somber piano music playing] [Gari] I thought I had already mapped out my life. Focus on my studies. Graduate with honors. Work in a field I'm passionate about. I forgot about planning my marriage. I fell in love, and... I got lost in the feeling. It felt so good to be in love. [lawyer] Annulment is a very complicated process. Here in the Philippines, marriage is very sacred. So, it's difficult to file for annulment. You have to go through a lot of steps and consider a lot of things. Are you ready for that, Gari? You shouldn't only be financially ready. You also need to be ready physically and most especially, emotionally. Okay? So, what are the grounds for annulment? There are several. We need to take the best direction. That way, we can win your case. Seven years of marriage with Sherwin is a long time. In those seven years, did you really get to know your partner? What did you like and hate about him? And most importantly... did you really love him? -[crowd clapping] -[woman] Thank you so much! Happy anniversary, Mom and Dad! Thank you! [MC] Thank you. That was a lovely song from the lovely daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Salvador. [people cheering] [woman] Please call my sister, Gari. -So, we have another singer. -[giggles] Let's call on stage "Gari!" -[people cheering] -[Gari] What? -[friends clamoring] Go! Gari! -[Gari] No! [woman] Come on, you should be ready for this. -[Gari] Oh, my God. -[friends] Go, Gari! [cheering] -Hi, baby. -Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. [MC] So, Gari, you're going to do a rap song? [Gari] What song? [people cheering] [MC] Anyone from the crowd? Who wants to help Gari sing a rap song? -[woman] Go, Gari! -This guy! [woman] Dad. You can join her. Go ahead. [all cheering] Does he really sing? [Sherwin] Sir, I don't sing. Sir, I can't, I'm a waiter. [Mr. Salvador] Go! [woman] Go, Gari! [woman] Go, Gari! [all cheering and whooping] Whoo! -[MC] Welcome on stage, Gari and Sherwin! -[Ryan] Is he a good singer? -[indistinct chatter] -[romantic piano music playing] [singing] ♪ I'm sorry, my love, I won't stay long ♪ ♪ I just want you to hear What my heart says ♪ -♪ Of this heart I offer to you ♪ -Let's go, bro! -♪ I hope you hear what my song says ♪ -You're so good! ♪ I want to let you know that I love you ♪ -♪ Please listen to... ♪ -Oh, wow. -He can sing. -He can. -♪ The beating of my heart ♪ -Who knew he could sing? ♪ I want to let you know you're my dream ♪ ♪ I want close the gap Between our worlds ♪ ♪ My heart is searching for your love ♪ -[loud cheering] -♪ It never forgets ♪ -♪ The love and joy you bring ♪ -[friends] Go, Gari! ♪ And I hope that You can bring it all back ♪ ♪ The way you look into my heart That longs for you ♪ [both singing] ♪ My heart is searching for your love ♪ [Gari rapping] ♪ Listen to me ♪ [both singing] ♪ My heart never forgets ♪ ♪ The love and joy you bring ♪ ♪ I really do hope You can bring it all back ♪ ♪ The way you look into my heart That longs for you ♪ -[cheering] -[woman] Very nice! -You have a beautiful voice. -[chuckles] Really? [exhales and laughs] Oh, my gosh. [chuckles] Ah, thank you. [both chuckling] -Thank you. -Thanks. [woman] You have a good voice, Gari. -[Gari] That was embarrassing. -[woman] I didn't expect that. [woman] Nice one, Gari! -[woman 1] The waiter was good, too. -[woman 2] You're so good! -[Gari] I wasn't ready for that. -Even the waiter aced it. We didn't know you had such a good voice. Why don't you sing next time? [Enrico] Sure. I sing better than him. [both speaking mixed English and Tagalog] Ma'am, I'm sorry about that. That was so embarrassing. -Your father pushed me on to the stage. -[chuckles] I'm sorry, he was a little drunk. It was all right. It was nice to learn that you were a good sport. Most rich people are snobbish. [chuckles] Well, um... not all the time. Sorry, ma'am. -No English. My nose bleeds. -[chuckles] [laughing] Oh, there's no blood yet. So, how long have you been a caterer? Ah... Ah, I study. I do side gigs for Ryan. He's the son of the owner of the catering business. My big brother, Enrico, is the one in the wheelchair. Then there's Ben and Ruel, my classmates at the auto mechanic school. Ah... Nice course. You can be a mechanical engineer. -[chuckles] -How about you, ma'am? Business management. Oh? That's so cool. I have lots of female friends who took the same course. You can get many job opportunities. My friends are now sales ladies at the mall. Awesome jobs. Mmm. [giggles] [lawyer] Gari. Gari, are you with me? Yes. Yes. Sorry, where were we? I'm saying... No, I'm asking. Are you a hundred percent sure about this annulment? This could take one and a half years, assuming it all goes smoothly. If not, it could take three to five years. The longer it takes, the more it will cost you. Gari, this is physically exhausting and emotionally draining. Okay, these are the papers I want you to sign so we can proceed with the case. You don't have to sign this right now. I want you to think about this carefully. Think really hard. [somber piano music playing] [horn honking] [horn honking] [engine sputters] [engine failing to start] [hand brake clicks on] [horn honking] [sighs] [both speaking mixed English and Tagalog] Ma'am Gari! Ma'am Gari! -[Gari] Yeah? -Sherwin, the caterer. Remember me? I rapped with you. -Oh, yeah! Hi, Sherwin! -How are you? I'm sorry, but... do you know anything about cars? My car broke down, and I just really need to go. I'm really in a hurry now, so I need help. Look, my nose is bleeding. -Oh! -[laughing] I'm sorry. I need help. My car broke down. I remember you told me you're a mechanic? -You remember that? -Yeah. But don't call me "ma'am." Just call me Gari. We're the same age. Okay, Gari. I'll open the hood. Thank you. Thank you. [Gari] Ugh. [Gari] Hi, Trish. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, my car broke down. Yeah, but there's this guy who's helping me. His name is Sherwin. The one who rapped with me at the party. Yeah. I don't know what happened to the car, but, yeah, I just hope I can make it on time. Yeah, okay. Hopefully my car will get fixed. I don't know what happened. What time is it? -Gari! -Yeah? It's good to go. The battery was just a little loose. Thank you, thank you! My car is already fixed. This Sherwin guy is really good. [romantic piano music] In fairness, it's not that bad in here. -[Sherwin] Thank you. -[woman] It's good things are okay. So, Sherwin, how many girlfriends have you had? [man] Serious ones? -[woman] I hope so. -[man] Just one. -[man 2] Seriously? -They always leave him because he's broke. How about the less serious ones? I've changed. [chuckles] My brother aims high, but he still smells like grease. It's a bit embarrassing for Gari. His brother just spilled the beans. Gari, congratulations on your new job. But please, let's celebrate. Just us girls. This is fine. Sorry about our place. What's the problem? I like it here. And if not for you, I wouldn't have made it to my interview on time. There you go! You actually saved me. It's nothing. [Gari] This is my plan. I'll make sure to do my performance well so I can be assigned in Singapore. [all cheer] -Singapore? Big time! -[woman] Yes! -You're going abroad? -[Gari] Mmm. That's the plan. How about you? What's your plan? I'll work at the car repair shop. I need a steady income. My brother was a soldier. He was shot in Mindanao. That's why he is in a wheelchair. Wow. You're so kind and hardworking. [Ryan] Yes, my friend here really is. -Really? -That's right. They said it. Since you're kind and hardworking, maybe I should just be your English tutor. -Tutor? -Tutor? -You have a tutor. -Let's drink to that. [chuckles] [romantic guitar music] -Bro. -Yeah? Let's grab something to eat. I'm hungry. You go ahead. I have to finish this. That way, Mr. Santos won't need to keep coming back. I brought my own lunch. I need to save up. What's all this change for? For Gari. It looks like you're serious about her. -But remember this. -What? She's way out of your league. We're just auto mechanics. We're poor. But Gari... comes from a rich family. I'm sure she's looking for a rich boyfriend. She's not like that. I'm sure she'll give me a chance. I won't waste it. And I promised myself I'd reach my goals, so I won't be an embarrassment to her family. We won't be auto mechanics for the rest of our lives, right? -She really has you under her spell, huh? -[metal clanks] I'll be going then. Bro, I need to ask a favor. I thought of something to do for Gari. -We'll talk later. -Go, have lunch. -I'll just grab something to eat. -[chuckles] [metal clanks] [Gari] What are we doing here? [Sherwin] You'll see. [romantic music playing] Guys? [all] Surprise! [romantic music continues] What's this? [chuckles] I love you, Gari. I already missed a lot of opportunities. And I don't you to be a missed opportunity, too. [sighs] I know you have doubts, and I will understand if you don't want to do this. Um... [romantic music continues] [laughing] Yes, I'll take a chance with you. -[Gari laughing] -[all cheering] [all] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! [all whooping] -[friends cheering] -[woman] Group hug! [Gari] What's the matter? Is there something you want to say? Um... is it okay for you... to marry someone poor? [chuckles] -Talking about marriage already? -[chuckles] We're already heading there anyway. [giggles] But seriously, is it okay with you? Uh... to be honest... mmm... no. But if a person has dreams and ambitions, why not? [soft piano music playing] Even if it's just a simple dream? Simple is better, right? But you should finish your studies first. Of course. So you can be proud of me, especially when facing your family. Sherwin, don't do it for me. Do it for yourself. So you can have a good life. Your life and our lives, together. [Gari] You're such a chatterbox. [romantic music playing] Thank you so much, Paulo. -Sorry for the trouble. -No worries. Did the car break down again? Um, just an ignition problem. It wouldn't start. Why didn't you call me? I was at work and my phone ran out of battery. How were you able to contact him? It was just good timing. I was in the area. Oh, is that so? Thanks, man, for bringing my wife home. Paulo, I'll fix you something to eat. We don't have any food. I haven't got the groceries. [Paulo] I'm still full anyway. Maybe next time, Gari. [Gari] Okay. Thanks again. Thank you. [engine starting] [sharply] Sherwin, can you show some respect to my visitors? He helped me out. Did I say anything wrong? You're so good at denying things. -Let me carry that. -I'm fine. Give it to me. [both sighing heavily] You really want an annulment? [objects clattering loudly] [drawers slamming] [both speaking mixed English and Tagalog] What should I do to make you forgive me? Tell me so we can fix this! Gari... please talk to me. Don't you want to fix our relationship? There's nothing to talk about. Is it because of that guy? What are you talking about? Can you please not drag Paulo into this? -You're disrespecting him-- -Stop talking to me in English! I feel like you're getting even on purpose. Is he my replacement now? Huh? I'm not like you. I wasn't the one who started all of this. So, let's end this issue. Gari, please, let's start all over again. I can't! I can't! Gari... Can you just let me go? [somber music playing] [door slams] [sobs] [shouting] Damn love! [panting] [sighs] You've been a couple for two years and you didn't even tell me? Whose idea was this? Mom, it was actually my idea. I'm sorry, I had to hide it from you guys first, because the plan was... for him to finish his studies first, and then... when his career became stable, that's when I'd tell you guys. I'm disappointed because you chose not to tell me, dear. I'm sorry, Mom. [Mrs. Salvador] You underestimated your mother. Don't take this the wrong way, but what can you do for my daughter? [Gari] Mom. -Um, ma'am... -Sorry. I love your daughter very much. And I promise to respect her. To tell you the truth, Gari has plans. And I am willing to support her. I won't do anything to get in her way. [romantic music playing] [romantic music continues] [Sherwin] Is this all real? I feel like I won the lottery. [both laughing] [Sherwin] I am so lucky to have you, Gari. [Gari] I am lucky to have you, too. I'm just a little scared. It all seems to be going a little too fast. [chuckles] Don't be scared... because we made the right decision. And I will do anything to achieve our dreams. [laughs] [sensual music playing] [wistful music playing] Good morning, hon. I made breakfast. [cell phone ringing] Pau? You're almost here? Okay, I'm on my way out. -Bye. -Won't you eat breakfast? I need to go. Sorry. Our customers are waiting for these items. Sorry. [engine stops] [gate creaks] [chuckles] Okay, thank you. [car door closes] [engine starts] [alarm ringing] Hon. Come on. -Hon. -What? Wake up. Five more minutes. What "five more minutes"? You're going to be late. I'll pick up Tricia. Do you want me to take you? I'll just take the MRT so I can get there faster. Okay. By the way... Hmm? Huh? Hon, my cell phone is still working. Its speaker is busted, remember? So, how can we hear each other if there's an emergency? [chuckles] How much was this? I don't have-- Forget about it. It's on me, okay? Don't stress over your interview. Just remember everything I taught you, okay? I know that already. If only the car repair shop wasn't closing down. You'll find another job. Just trust yourself, okay? [laughs] Good morning. [Gari] Good morning. Get up! I still have something on the stove. Good luck. Don't you have any plans to have children? We're not yet ready. What? Gari, you've been together for five years. And you're still not ready? Oh, my God! Are you hiding something from us? Are you infertile? Tricia, don't exaggerate, you'll jinx me. Knock on wood. It was our choice to marry, okay? "Choice"? Or are you compromising for your husband's sake? When is Sherwin going to be ready? [sighs] [Gari] Okay, so we're doing this according to size. So, what comes first? This one? Oh, there's a bigger one. Okay. -And? -That? This one. Okay, do you mind... -Do you mind continuing this? -Gari. Oh! Okay, please finish this, okay? I'll be back. I was able to collect payments. There's a bazaar at Centris. Four weekends. -Let's reserve a spot early. -Sure. -Let's do it? -Of course. Okay. Oh, wow. Okay. Almost done. Mr. Gallardo, I'll forward your application to the managing director. Then I'll just contact you once you're chosen for the final interview. Thank you. By the way, regards to Gari. You know my wife? Yes. Didn't she mention that we know each other? She actually referred you to me for the interview today. [melancholy music playing] Look at that smile. Of course! It's payday. Oh, this is my payment for the blouses I ordered. -Okay. -And... this is the list of perfumes I will order. Good. I will give them to you tomorrow. Hold on. Here's my share for the money-lending system. Can we switch places for now? I need money for next month. That's fine, that way I won't be tempted to spend my money. As you know, I'm saving up for something. I should be first in line to see your jewelry, okay? -Mmm-hmm! -Can I have some of your salad? They say... you'll earn a lot from selling jewelry. But I need to save up the capital. I'll be honest, I admire your hard work. You act poor, but your family is so rich. [laughs] You're right. But... my parents are rich, not me. I just don't want to depend on them. How's Sherwin? [door opens] [Sherwin groans] Hon. -[Sherwin] Uh... -Hon. Sorry I didn't meet you outside. I was changing clothes. -Did you leave anything in the car? -No. Where are you going? It's Ryan's birthday. We're going out drinking. You're going out to drink? You've already had alcohol. I can go alone. -Wait, hon. -Yeah? How was your interview? [sighs] You didn't tell me you knew the interviewer. What did she tell you? Gari... I told you I didn't want you to do that. I'm sorry, I thought I could help. -So, that's why I had to-- -Excuse me. -[upbeat music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -Hey! -[both laughing] Glad you could make it! -I thought you'd bail on us. -No way. Where's your wife? Oh, you know how she is. Nice, we have no chaperone! [chuckles] [Sherwin] You're crazy. Ryan! -[Sherwin] Ryan! -Oh, right. -[Sherwin] Happy birthday. -Thank you, bro. Why are you late? And why do you look like that? [chuckles] Stop it. I was in a hurry. [Ryan] I know that. Oh, hold on, my boyfriend's here. -Grab a drink. I'll be back. -Okay. Happy birthday! [Ryan] Hello. All right, go on. -Hi. -Hi. I'm Samantha. -[nervously] Ah... -Drink? Thanks. Sherwin. Cheers. [somber music playing] [yawns] [indistinct chatter] [Sherwin stammers] [Samantha chuckles] [Sherwin chuckles] I can't zip it up. [grunts] Gosh. [chuckles] The zipper's stuck. [Samantha whispers] Let me do it. [heartbeat racing] [Samantha laughs] I need to go home. My wife is waiting for me. [Sherwin groans] Just stay here. What? Let's get some rest. Okay. [sensual music playing] [Sherwin groans] [Sherwin grunts softly] [sexy music continues] [groans weakly] [sensual music intensifies] [knocking on door] [knocking on door] Just a sec! Hon! I'm sorry. Did I wake you up? -Stay here. I'll boil some water. -[groaning incoherently] -I'm fine. -Just sit on the couch. -I'm okay. -Just sit here. [retching] Hon... sit down. [groans weakly] [somber music playing] [woman] I want to sell Gari some sleep. Look, she's so sleepy. She was up all night waiting for her husband. Gari, you're always sleep-deprived, but your husband is always either asleep or drunk. -Oh, my God. -What's happening to Sherwin? Those are signs of depression. -Stop making a big deal out of it. -[giggles] Sherwin was out all day looking for work. The car repair shop he works at is closing down. And after, he was at Ryan's birthday party, so please don't overreact. [Tricia] I don't understand. You always defend your husband. You keep tolerating him. Because that's how marriage works, Tricia. That's how marriage works. What you have to learn? Try not to be so bitter about men simply because of your ex. -Your Honor, all men are the same. -[giggles] Well, I object. Because ladies, I have with me Paulo. You remember him? [all] Hi. Hi. [groans softly] [clock ticking] [groans] [exhales heavily] [grunts] WHAT'S UP, BRO? ANY SLOTS AVAILABLE? SORRY, BRO. NO SLOT AVAILABLE. [somber music playing] DO YOU HAVE ANY JOB OPENINGS? NO VACANCIES. [cell phone dings] [somber music continues] So, which class were you classmates with Gari in? Statistics. How come I've never seen you on campus? Well, I kept a low profile then. Studied abroad. Then took up master's in Columbia. Wow. Actually, he was doing so well in Wall Street when we met. So, why did you come back here to the Philippines? Well, it's a long story, but to cut the story short, I'm here to oversee my family's businesses. And he wants to do business with us. Especially with you, Gari. [Paulo chuckles] Thanks for the lift. I hope it wasn't any trouble. It's fine. My condo is just around the corner. It was nice seeing you again. And... I hope to see you soon? Oh, for your business proposal. [laughs] Sure. -[Gari] Thanks again. -[Paulo] Welcome. -[Sherwin] Who was that? -Hi. Um... Hon, that was Paulo Custodio. He used to be my classmate. He's my soon-to-be business partner. Where did you two go? Was it just the two of you? I haven't seen him for ages. It was just a business meeting. I was with the girls earlier. [sighs] I have a new business venture. Jewelry. The capital's a lot, but I've saved up enough. Let's talk about it tomorrow. There's food on the table. I'm going to bed. [footsteps approaching] Good morning, hon. I'm glad you're up. I ironed your clothes and made breakfast. Sit down. I'll prepare the food. [romantic music playing] [softly] Are you feeling sick? Since I'm still out of work... I can look after the house. Sure. [Sherwin grunts softly] But I'm sure I can find work... so that I can make it up to you. I will support... your new business venture. Thank you. I love you. I love you. [sensual music playing] [both laugh] [soft gasp] Bite me. [grunts] [crickets chirping] [cell phone ringing] Hello? [Samantha] Hello, Sherwin. Hold on. -Sam. -[Samantha] Sherwin. [whispers] Why did you call at this hour? -My wife might wake up. -No reason, I just missed you. [indistinct chatter] [cell phone rings] Hello? Hello, this is Mayi from Pinoy Bank Collections. I would like to remind you that your account is already due. Okay, okay, I will pay it within the day. But I just have a few errands to run, though. But I'll pay it within the day. All right, I'll make a note that you will pay today. Then you will avoid penalties. Okay. Okay. All right, thank you. -[man] Bro, wait up for me. -[Sherwin] Okay. [cell phone ringing] -Hon? -[Gari] Hon... have you paid my credit card bill? Sorry, I wasn't able to take care of it. I had an interview. Okay, I'll handle it. -How was your interview? -[engine whirring] I'll call you back later. It's noisy out here. Okay. Bye. [sighs] Bro, I told you to keep working here at the shop while you're looking for a new job. I'm sure Ryan will understand. I just don't want to let Gari down. I won't be earning as much here. She had to take up another job. That's why you shouldn't quit working here before the shop actually closes down. Keep working here for now. [Gari] All right. Bigger circle. Yes? Find your partner. [clapping] Spread out. [children singing indistinctly] [adults clapping] March. [indistinct chatter] Isn't that Sherwin? Where's Gari? -[Samantha] Sherwin. -Hi. Look at this. -[woman] Who's that girl? -[Samantha] Isn't it beautiful? [camera clicks] -[Samantha] Let's go. -[Sherwin] Let's go. We have to send this to Gari. [Tricia] I knew it. I was right all along. Your husband is cheating on you. It's obvious from this picture Lorie and Mayi sent us. What now? You're still skeptical? Gari, you just said you smelled women's perfume. You also read some texts. And now there's this picture? What other evidence do you need to confront your husband? Maybe Sherwin takes you for a fool. Gari, you're a smart woman. But wake up. [grunts softly] [whispers] Shit. Gari? -Excuse me, I have to go. -Gari. [Gari grunts softly] Gari! [Gari panting] Gari, are you okay? Finally, I can meet this very lucky woman. Sherwin, she might not be headed home yet. Sam, I'll just get a glass of water. Sherwin. [somber music playing] We already talked about this. We're just friends, remember? [gate creaking] [Sherwin inhales deeply] I'm Gari... Sherwin's wife. Gari. I'm not talking to you. Who are you? Aside from "mistress," what else do they call you? Get the hell out of my house. Oh... you left your bag. Your bag looks cheap. -But you're cheaper. -[gasps] You can go now. [gate slams forcefully] Lock the door when you leave. -Gari. -Don't touch me. Gari, can we talk? Please let me explain. Fine... let's talk about it. How many times did you do it inside this house? In our bedroom? On my bed? How many times? How many times... did you do it in a motel? Do you two... shower together, too? Do you also rub her back? [Sherwin crying] Tell me, Sherwin... do we smell the same? Do we smell the same? [sniffles] Gari... Get out. Gari. Gari. [sobs loudly] [sniffs and exhales] [sobbing] [Sherwin sniffling] [sobbing] -[Gari gasps] -[Sherwin] Gari. -[Gari sobbing] -Gari. Gari. She didn't know that she was two months pregnant. She needs to rest and take her medicine. And she should avoid any stress. Excuse me. [somber music playing] [softly] Baby. Hon. Eat your breakfast. I don't want to eat. -Hon, please-- -I said I don't want to eat. Gari, I know... that you can't forgive me just yet. But I will do everything I can to make it up to you. Don't bother. This is not about my love for you. This... is about betrayal of trust. I can no longer continue this relationship. I've lost my faith in you. Gari, please. [Lorie] You know, Gari, that I would love to take this case and file the petition for you. But, Gari, you have to be 100% sure. Gari? Gari, are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I've already forgiven him, but... it's the end of the road for us. Once the petition has been filed, who will leave the house? You or him? No one needs to leave. As long as the court doesn't find out you guys are still living in the same house, it's okay. Plus, Gari, I just have to remind you, you can't be too harsh. You still have to undergo a very complicated process. Yeah. Sherwin will leave once everything is finalized. I mean, we are both amicable. If that's the case, then why don't you-- No, no, no. It's just... I'm not going to change my mind. Lorie's going to be my lawyer, and she's going to help me file the case. All right. If we are doing this, we have to figure out the grounds of your annulment. Here in the Philippines, we have a lot of reasons. One, lack of parental consent, which obviously did not happen. Two, fraud. Three, party is isn't able to consummate the marriage. Again, with you, did not happen. Four, you married out of force, intimidation, undue influence, which needs to be filed within the first five years of your marriage. Five, STD. Six, mental illness. Again, within the period of marriage. Now, you just really have to decide which one among those. [sighs heavily] -[metal clanking] -[Sherwin groans] Let's grab something to eat. -Let's finish this later. -Let's go. -Okay. -Let's eat. [Sherwin] Thank you. I earned a few extra bucks even if it was just for a couple of days. Do you want me to tell Gari it was all my fault? That I gave your number to Samantha in exchange for her friend's number? You're an idiot. It's not your fault. It's all on me. I let myself be tempted. I dragged her into my own mess. This is not the life I promised her and her family. While the case hasn't been filed... try to win her back. She might change her mind. You have to win back her family's trust, too. [all exclaiming and cheering] Thank you! -[Mr. Salvador] What did you get? -Let's see. [all exclaiming] It's so cute. -[man] Hi! -[all] Hi! [man] Hello! [Lorie] From your adopted daughter. Happy birthday. -[woman] Hi. -[Gari] Hi. [indistinct chatter] [Mr. Salvador] You're going to watch your videos? Give Grandpa a kiss. [clears throat] [chatter quiets] Of course... I've saved the best for last. [laughing] -To the most beautiful woman I've met. -[all exclaiming] Honey. [Gari] Dad... [chuckles] [woman] That's so pretty. -[Gari] Happy birthday! -[Mr. Salvador] I love you very much. [Gari] Happy birthday, Mom. [woman] Aww. [giggles] -[Gari] Oh, gosh. -[Sherwin] Good evening. -[Mrs. Salvador] Oh! -I'm sorry I'm late. -Mommy, happy birthday. -Oh, wow. I'm sorry I'm late. This is beautiful. Grab some food. -It seems I already missed dinner. -I saved a plate for you. -Come on, come on. -Thank you, I'm excited. -[Sherwin] Gari. -Excuse me for a second. [whispers] Let's talk outside. Um, sorry I'm late. Why did you come here? Why not? Things are all right between your mom and I. You didn't even bother to change your shirt. [sighs] There are clean shirts inside the car. You can go change. [somber music playing] [woman] Gari... you should keep Sherwin company. Um, excuse me. Excuse me. -Sherwin. -Dad. How are you and Gari? Dad... we're trying to fix our relationship. You should. Dad, I'm really sorry. [sighing] I'm really sorry. Sherwin... there's no such thing as a perfect relationship. I myself also did some terrible things to Gari's mom. But I owned up to my sins because I love my family. And I know they love me, too. I man up to my mistakes, Sherwin. Mommy. Son. I heard about you and Gari. Do you want me to talk to her? [light piano music playing] Do you feel better after throwing me under the bus in front of my parents? I didn't throw you under the bus. -They were just asking how we are-- -It's the same thing. You should have just avoided the situation, you know. My mom is already dealing with a lot of things right now. My mom caught my dad cheating on her. And on top of that, my sister and I have a half-sibling. So, why did you have to burden them with our problems? [stammers] Just... I don't get it. I don't even understand why my mom is just, like, cool about it. She won't give up and leave your dad easily. She's different. I'm not like her. [Samantha] I had no intention of ruining your family. I had no choice. Am I mean? Am I an evil person? No, you were just in love. I'm doing the best I can. But why do I always fall short? I always feel so unlucky. [Sherwin sighs] I know what you're feeling. But you're lucky to have someone like her. If I could only take her place... [both chuckle softly] [Samantha sniffles] I love my wife, Samantha. [light piano music playing] -I'll go ahead. -Take care. Take your meds. [Sherwin] I have something for you. Bro. -You don't have to. -Take it. I don't want you and Gari to fight over this. It's fine. That's nice of you, then. Thanks, bro. Bro, how do you make up with your wife? [laughs] It's simple. Whatever she wants, I give her. [light guitar music playing] But, Gari... wants to leave me. Don't give up so easily. Until you run out of bullets, keep fighting. You might get a better shot. Our relationship is on the rocks. But I will fight for our love till the end. I will give her all the things she wants. Bro... just hang in there. Hang in there. [upbeat music playing] [woman] You'll have to register as a late enrollee. Registration period ended last week. -Classes are starting this week. -Can still get a spot? My graduation status was on track before I went AWOL. Try to register your classes with your professors. Do you still have classes at night? -Yes, we do. -All right. Here. -Thank you. -Okay. [upbeat music continues] Congratulations, Teacher Gari. Why, ma'am? It's official! You have been promoted to assistant principal. [gasps] Thank you! Thank you so much, ma'am! [stammers] I'll work so hard to prove to you that you made the right decision. Thank you. I trust you will. Despite your busy schedule, you were able to finish your master's. You deserve it. Thank you! Thank you so much, ma'am. Congratulations again. Thank you. Gari... I'm sorry for meeting you here. Is there a problem? I just needed to give this to you. I got you a discount for the stall. This is huge! 50%? It's only 50%. That's nothing. Pau, I... I want to be fair to you. Even if my annulment has been finalized, I just want you to know, I'm not ready to be in a relationship. I don't want to lead you on. -Thank you. -Mmm-hmm. [dishes clattering] [upbeat music playing] [door opens] Hon, you're home. Have you had dinner? Do you want me to buy you food? No. I already had dinner. [sighs] Hon, I am going to try this time. I told you-- I'm going to bed. [softly] Just this once, hon... Just go to sleep. You're my wife. You have a duty. -What are you doing? -Give me what I want! [Gari grunting] Sherwin, stop it! I told you to stop! [grunts] Is this what you want? Is this what you want? Is this what you want? Just tell me. [tense music playing] [Sherwin panting] [grunts] Does this feel good? You like this? Harder. [panting] Harder. [sensual music playing] [Sherwin groans] [Sherwin grunts] Did you enjoy that? Of course. Thank you. [scoffs] That's just sex. We both need it. I'm going to sleep downstairs. [door closes] [somber piano music playing] This won't take long. I'll take you to work. -[Gari] Don't worry, I got this. -Let me take you to work. Pau, what are you doing here? I thought you wanted my help to bring your stuff to the bazaar? I got this covered, man. Let's just convoy? My wife will ride with me. Sherwin. I'll take her there. -I still have some stuff inside. -Let me help you. [Sherwin] No need. We can manage. You're going to ride with me. [indistinct chatter] -[all] Hello. -[Gari] Hi, guys. I had a hard time setting this whole thing up. Did you bring everything? Yeah, of course. -Sherwin, it's nice you came to help. -Yeah. Actually, he's on his way home. Thank you. I can help around here. You don't have to do that. Okay, you can help with the merchandise. -Let me help you with that. -Okay, thanks. Let me do it. Just go help Mayi. -Hi, ma'am. -Hi. That's class A product. Manufactured in Hong Kong. So, we assure you, we have quality products. So, this is not authentic? We also have authentic brands at a higher price. -Want to see? -Sure. Ma'am? That will smell good on you even if it's not authentic. Try this out, ma'am. This scent will smell good on you. [Sherwin] This one is better. -[woman exclaims] -This is much-- -Sorry, sorry! -[glass shattering] [Gari] Sherwin! -Ma'am, are you going to buy the perfume? -Sorry, Gari. [Sherwin] Sorry. Sorry, sorry! Don't touch it! -Sherwin... -Can you just leave? Can you please buy us some drinks? Sorry, I didn't see it. Damn you! You know Gari is my wife, right? -We are not doing anything wrong. -Stop it! Stop it! Sherwin, what's the matter with you? You're trying to make a move on Gari! -Stop it. -I'm not like you! -I wouldn't cheat on my wife! -What did you say? Stop it, Sherwin! Stay away! [Gari] You shouldn't have come. What, so you could flirt with that guy? God. Not all men are like you. Paulo is different. He's a gentleman. You're going to rub that in my face again? Do you want to get back at me? Fine, keep flirting with that guy. I'm not stupid like you. Stupid. Illiterate. Hard-luck. Cheater. Get it off your chest, whatever will make you feel better. Do you really want to know what will make me feel better? Tell me. -Tell me! -Our annulment. Set me free! I'm done! I'm done with this relationship! [engine revving] Sherwin. You've got to slow down the car. Sherwin! [tires screeching] [car crashing] -[Mr. Salvador] Hi. How are you, baby? -Hi, Dad. [Mr. Salvador] Welcome home, Gari. -Hi, Dad. -Are you okay? Oh, baby. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm good. Let's go. -Any more bags? -Yes, I have one more bag. Dear, I'll just take this up to your room, okay? [Gari] Thanks, Dad. ♪ What do you want? What do you want? ♪ Hi, Mom. Baby, how are you? -Huh? -I'm okay. Oh, sweetheart, are you sure? Yes, yes. Okay. Hi. Hi. -Say hi. -Hi. [chuckles] Whose baby is this? Well, you remember... your dad had a mistress, and she had a baby? Well, she died. And... your dad brought this angel home. Who else will take care of him, if not his dad? Mom... -[baby cries softly] -[Mrs. Salvador] Shh. Shh. ...how are you so forgiving? It's hard. But... You know, I think it's worth it. Because... I just choose to forgive and accept, rather than... lose the people who matter to me the most. Baby... it's choices. Shh... And if you choose to let go, baby, it's okay. It's valid. It's very valid. Okay? Okay? Okay. Come here. [melancholy music playing] Son of a bitch, Gari left me! [sobbing] I'm so stupid. No wonder she left. [Enrico] Just let it all out. It's okay. Just let it all out. [sobbing] It's okay. [sobbing] [sobbing] [melancholy music playing] Bro... I did everything I could to make things better. But I failed. I can't blame her... It was all my fault. I wasn't a good husband to her. [sniffles] Bro... don't blame yourself. You're not perfect. Your relationship is not perfect. Both of you have weaknesses. You're just human. You make mistakes... and get hurt, too. [sobbing] I don't want to give up. Bro. [sobbing] [lawyer] Your wife filed for annulment. For the court to grant her petition, she'll do everything she can to prove that you're psychologically incapacitated... or that your mental capacity is not enough to fulfill your role as the husband. That doesn't mean you're a nutcase. She will just use that... as a reason to prove that your relationship is not healthy. They might spin the truth to their advantage. Do you understand what I'm saying? Mr. Gallardo, you will hear a lot of things that might shock you. You should be prepared. Because I am sure they will do everything in their power to prove their point. [Lorie] Mrs. Gallardo... what is the educational attainment of your husband? Did he complete his bachelor's degree from a reputable school? With Latin honors like yourself? No. He took up a vocational course. Two years... but he didn't finish. [Lorie] Vocational. Two years. Unfinished. So, Mrs. Gallardo, what jobs did your husband have? He was an auto mechanic for eight years. Last year he was removed from work. He was jobless for a year. In the period that your husband was jobless, if I may ask, how did you manage your finances? Does he come from a well-off family? Did his family give you financial assistance? Does he have enough savings to cover for utilities, rent, food, schooling, et cetera? [Gari] I did everything on my own. The house we're living in was a gift from my parents. So, there's no rent that needs to be paid. I'm also a preschool teacher. I have an online business. I sell merchandise at bazaars. You can call me an entrepreneur as well. So, let me recap this, Mrs. Gallardo. During the time your husband has been jobless, it is safe to say that you were the breadwinner. Correct? And even while your husband was working, you earned more than he did. You share was more than his in terms of covering household expenses. Is that correct, Mrs. Gallardo? Yes. Mrs. Gallardo, would you say your husband last year was... deeply affected after losing his job? [Gari] Yes. His self-esteem went down. His self-esteem went down. Would you say he took up his past vices? -Yes. -What are those? -Alcohol. -[Lorie] What else? Did he cheat on you? Was he a womanizer? Did you catch him red-handed? I came home... and caught him kissing someone else. Inside my own house. [Lorie] Mrs. Gallardo... I know this might be a very difficult question for you... but according to your medical report last year, you had a miscarriage. Gari... Was it because of your husband, Mrs. Gallardo? I know we're... I know we're both not ready to have a child yet. Because I wanted him to change. I wanted him to be responsible. [sobbing] But... when I lost my baby... [sniffles] ...it was so painful for me. Losing a child was more painful... than his reckless behavior. It was very difficult to lose my baby. [sobbing] I lost my child because he cheated on me. -[bangs table] -Stop it, Gari! -Stop asking those questions! -[gavel rapping] -[judge] Order in the court! -Enough! [softly] Not here. [sobbing] I'm sorry. [sobbing] [melancholy music playing] Gari, I'm so sorry. I know I've had a lot of shortcomings... in our relationship. I'm sorry, too. I had shortcomings, too. I thought I was helping you. I thought I was just supporting you as your wife. I didn't know you felt shackled. I'm sorry I didn't see that. It was my fault. Gari, I'm sorry. Hon, I'm sorry. [sighs] The next hearing will be in two days. [sighs heavily] [Ben] Sherwin. Ben! [breathes deeply] [lawyer] Friend. My client has decided not to contest your client's petition for annulment. And furthermore, he would like to help your client be granted her petition the soonest and without obstacle. Please, please, extend our thanks. My client will really be very appreciative. -Thank you. -Thank you, friend. [Sherwin] I'll just take my stuff in the car. Can you help me out? [Sherwin grunts] Thank you. Bro... both of you take care of yourselves. Be careful on the ship. You should man up from now on. Are you sure about this? This is the only way to help me move on... so I can also start fresh. I'll go. Take care. You, too. We're always here for you. [melancholy music playing] [melancholy music continues] This was your choice. [Gari sobs] Shh, baby. [sobbing] [Mrs. Salvador] Shh... Why am I hurting? Because it's all over. You needed an authority to tell you you're free. And now that it's real... you're starting to wonder if the happy moments with Sherwin were a lie. Baby, no. That's not true. They were real and they were precious. But like all happy things that come to an end, they'll just be memories. No more looking forward. No more future with him. So, allow yourself to grieve the love you lost, baby. But, you know... you can also decide to be happy, sweetheart. You can make that choice to be happy on your own. If you believe that you made the right choice... stand by it. I just want to be brave like you. Baby... I'm not brave. I just love your Daddy so much. -[sobbing] -Oh, baby. Shh... Shh... Hush, baby. [Gari sobbing] Shh... [melancholy music playing] [music fading] I've only dated a few men in my life. I'm very picky. [both chuckling] -[woman] I know what I like in a man. -May I sit? [woman] I promised myself that I would marry a doctor. At least six feet tall. Hopefully Caucasian. Because I wanted to have a child with blonde hair. I prayed for my ideal man. The heavens didn't answer my prayer, but they gave you to me. Look to your left. [woman] Ben... -You might not be the man I asked for... -Did you see him? [woman] But the heavens knew you were the man I needed. Your love is inspiring. Your love pushes me to become a better person. Your love is true and selfless. I can love you longer than a day beyond forever. [audience applauding and cheering] [Sherwin] Hi. -Do you want to go to the bathroom? -I think that's a good idea. [indistinct chatter and cheering] [applause continues] How are you? I'm fine. How about you? I'm fine. You look prettier. [chuckles] Thank you. You know... I'm glad to see you again. I missed you. Me, too. I heard you're doing great now. I'm happy for you. [wistful piano music playing] You were right. Maybe this was the right thing for us. And I'm glad... to see you happy right now. I hope you've forgiven me. Of course. Friends? Of course. Of course. [all applauding and cheering] [sweeping classical music playing] [music continues] [Gari] It will never be completely over. We don't forget people we have loved. We... we just don't make them part of our future. I just need to go back to planning my life. I was not broken by love. I... I became stronger. And when I think of Sherwin, it will all be happy thoughts. Those moments will always remain precious. We both deserve that. Love is always good. [sweeping music continues] [light guitar music playing]
