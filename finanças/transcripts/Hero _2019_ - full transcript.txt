My father called me. They wanted to kill me. Es geht um die Jugend. It's about the youth. Aber er ist tot. But he's dead. On the phone he said I should run away. Something is wrong with youth. That was the beginning. I thought you were in danger too. That's why I'm here. How did you find me? About Poland. At the Skydiving Festival. - I jumped there too. - But you didn't talk to me. I thought you were in there work at the dizzy heights. After that then I have found you here. - No... I'm not active anymore. - Something's brewing. You have to come along until that is cleared up. I stay there in the corner. Nice to see you. As well. Not bad to work here. We introduced ourselves as relatives, this saves us further questions. We're Secret Service. We know you are of youth. Rakhmanova, we also know that you do not say anything without the password. But only you know this password and Colonel Rodin. we know everything You are an orphan, very gifted. Rodin found you. Brought you to youth and then here, as a student. - We've been looking for you for 15 years. - You personally, all these years? Rakhmanova, it's time to serve your country. We now do the following: I'll either call security or... Take his radio button. Andrei, this way. And now? 'A wrench with you? Do you need help? Hurry before the door opens! - What if it's not long enough? - Yes, that's enough. - Don't worry. - Why then? Because it's going down. - Who is good? I am good. - Come on, run! Man, not so fast. FOREIGN SECURITY SERVICE, MOSCOW Comrade General. It must be youth. Maria Rakhmanova. She works as a PR manager. - A PR manager? - Yes. Your profile is waterproof, nothing suspicious. She is living in Germany, with a German passport. He was with her. Wait a moment. This is Rodin. - You mean his son? - Yes, his son. Which agent is there? Get in touch with him. NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA, GERMANY Yes? Understood. Lena, your mother is calling. - Stay with her. - Yes. 2, 7. O, 6.7, 8. Hello, does youth mean something to you? Everyone listen up! You know Colonel Rodin. He's a legend, a hero. 1979, Afghanistan. 1981, Angola. 1982, Cuba. 1983, North Korea. In early 2000 he dropped across the country look for orphans, which he as part of a school exchange program abroad. The name of the school was "Youth". Rodin thought about the future. Recruitment became more and more dangerous. He wanted to raise a row of sleepers. You should have a career and wait for orders. Two years after appointment Colonel Rodin died. An accident. He was the only one who knew the names addresses and passwords. The youth gave not allowed to talk to him. So we had agents around the world, but couldn't get in with them Get in touch, for over 15 years. Two weeks ago, Roman Popov was supposed to be in the US Embassy in England to give a speech. He is the only representative of youth that has popped up over the years. During the speech he became kidnapped by strangers. Today there were two more Youth members spotted. Here they are We need her alive. For now, they're holding up in Germany. Do you have his number? Did you call him? Do you remember the number - No, unfortunately not. - What about your memory training? No chance that has unfortunately not affected by me. Come along. Russian? - What? - No sorry. - Try to remember the number. - Damned... - Have you! - Very funny. And, already called? "Yes. Is not available. - I think it's funny. - Yes, the howler. - The area code of Kaliningrad. - Have you noticed, huh? Your shoelace is untied. Down with you, down! - And where now? - To Kaliningrad. Andrei, no. Our faces are now in all databases. Any customs officer can arrest us. We must wait, hide. We need to find out what's going on there and who wants to kill us. The best we can do is find my father he can explain everything. Why did he fake his death? Was it really worth it? BREAKING This morning was near London Roman Popov's body found. We don't know what happened there but the whole world thinks that it was us. I always had doubts about that Project youth if I'm honest. But Rodin said we get a weapon which cannot be compared to anything. Nobody but him had youth contact information. We have no idea at all what these people are up to and who your client is. Roman Popov was just one small fish in this game. The big fish is still out there. We need to find out who is behind all this. - Calm down! - I'll scratch your eyes out! You're hysterical, you stupid bitch! - Just stay away from me! - What have I done? Nothing! - You should be admitted! - Hey, hey, hey! - Stop, stop, stop! - Hey, away from me! - Stop, stop! - Stop it, stop it! - Okay? - This is my man! - I'm sorry, darling. - It's all ok. - Secure? - Yes, this is my husband. - Ah, let's go. - Is okay. - You hit me. - Sorry. You punk Here. Come on. May I ask - First to Poland, then to Russia. - Hitler thought so too. At the next big bridge let's grab them. Snipers! COME ON! FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE, KALININGRAD We could not capture the people A team member has died, we will send a replacement as soon as possible. I lost her. Listen, I have 15 years ago already lost Rodin. I have no clues. - I don't know where they could be stuck. - Neither do I. But we will definitely find them. I'm sure. Actually they can just flee home, right? GRONOWO, POLAND [Andre], I wanted one have been asking you for a long time: - Why did you leave me? - What do you think? When you're gone from youth Did he say it like that? Well done dad. - I didn't go voluntarily. - What happened? I was 14 when my mother died. I was finished. I needed a hold but he was never there. Then one day he came and said: "Come on, let's go on a trip. You need some encouragement." I was like, "Wow, cool! We're going to the sea, to Sochi or something." I ended up in a 'nem filthy hole, with 20 other idiots. And also with you. That was the beginning, with orders, discipline and training. I liked it too of course, but... Damn, if only he had talked to me once like a real father. Well then I took a knife and cut my hand. I wanted attention. I thought he would come then hug me and comfort me. And? did he comfort you He arrived and told me: "I always wanted a girl." So then I became one. It's nice here, isn't it? Let's get off. We are staying here. Once we have passports we live like normal people. Then we can have a barbecue here and go to the sauna. - Of course we also need a dog. - You're allergic to that. Bravo. Fuck that fanatic I am serious. Where did he get you from From an orphanage for the gifted? And then he gave you the youth- missed brainwashing. So what? Nothing and. For you he is a fanatic. But for me it became a father. For all of us. If not for me... That's why youth is my purpose in life. - I missed you. - One German, one city, one tone. - What is that? - The password. How is that, when I tell you your password will you follow me then Will you then do everything I want? So, with the Russian criminal law it should be agreed. There's our hero. - So what did you find out? - You've crossed the border and move towards Kaliningrad. That makes sense. His grave is there. Oleg Ivanovich RODIN - Where did you live in Kaliningrad? - I do not know it anymore. We have moved often. I had no friends. It went on all the time we could break up the tents at any time. What do we do next? Let's go eat something. How do you feel now? That's OK. - What are we waiting for? - I want you to say goodbye. - Do not shoot. - Do not shoot. - Go Go go! - Circle them! Give it to me. - Jump in! - Damned... I can not believe it. Do not shoot. Grab her. It's stuck. - Turn around, we have to get her! - You already have them. - Who is this? - A former friend. Hi Papa. Do you want to tell me something? Maybe explain something? No? Anyway, thanks for your call. That was not me. Put the pen down Who told you that I'm alive? You. - Y-you called me yourself. - You're not that stupid, are you? Drink. Flushes the lungs. So did you call or not? Drink. Can we get started? Write down people's names who you have contacted in the past year. - Not in the last 15 years? - I don't care, yes. Your memory has always been very good. - It still is. - Then start. - There's something else in there. - Too much milk is harmful. You know, Masha, even if it is doesn't look like it at the moment I'm on your side Just tell me what's going on here. Yes I know you without a password not allowed to talk to anyone. But you are at home, Masha. Let's talk she is completely calm speaks with conviction. Listen, no consul will ever know where you are. So, go ahead and talk. Masha, you must understand that you will definitely talk. You have five minutes. Think it over. How did you find Rakhmanova? On the skydiver festivals in Poland, I saw her there by accident. Well and then I've got it Social media located. - I found her on Instagram... - ...and moved your server to her. Something like that, yes. What kind of generation is this, all of them reveals their personal information? Who you are, where you are, with whom... - Why? - Why should I hide it? I'm not a spy or agent. IM a nobody. Any father would like to hear this shit. I included. I'm calling a few people. They will take you to Sweden. - Then you'll have to manage on your own. - The desired participant can't answer the call. The number is switched off or unreachable. - I won't go without Masha. - How is this supposed to work? Would you like to ask politely whether the secret service gives your girlfriend away? - The number you dialed... - I don't know. - .Yes, likewise. - The number is switched off or unreachable. Dad, I thought for 15 years that you are dead do you have any idea how did I feel during this time? Oh man... dad, you can't give me help at least once? Help me with Masha. - And the clothing? - Are in the closet. They wouldn't talk either if Rodin had taught you. - She's not the target now. - Rodin won't just pull away. - All the exits here are guarded. - He's not even thinking of leaving. The youth will gather around him. If we follow her, we'll find him. Maxim Mikhailovich. Comrades, I have to speak to the boss. Please lead me to him. Exactly at 8:30 p.m you turn off the lights - OK. - Repeat it. At 8:30 p.m. I turn off the lights. Exactly at 8:30 p.m I turn off the lights Hide the vest. Stop! Stay there! Who are you? What are you doing here? What have you got there? Drop the gun! What time is it? 8:30 p.m. cutting through. Guys I'm getting sick of the cold floor. Does it have to be that way? Give him his slippers. Thanks. Damned. Are you completely stupid? Death changes you a lot. - Why did you come, huh? - To talk to an old friend. I hear my former friend. No, I'm listening to you. Why did you fake your death? They demanded of me the youth passwords. The kids should be used earlier. I had to protect her. What are you trying to achieve here, Rodin? - Maxim Mikhailovich. - What? Who did you sell the youth to? Is he crazy Interesting. - What do you think? - I don't know. - That's why I'm asking you. - Are you questioning me? I need you to tell me one thing. Why did you rise again - Bring him here. - Okay, got it. - Down! Come on, bring your weapons! - All right... Calm, very calm. NOT ST ROM GENERATOR RUNNING What was that? Where's the backup generator? Tell me! Up there. Our entertainment brings me really no further. But torture doesn't apply to you. Take Rakhmanova to Cell 14. It will continue soon. Here. Come drink She lives! Thanks. - Give it to me. - You're wasting time. You are real survivors. Do you know why? They wanted to get to me through you guys. Well done Kataev. I figured it was Kataev. We have to catch him. Are you in? - Where do you want to go? - We need to find out to whom Kataev wanted to sell the youth. And you nod to that? Well, Kataev has to be rendered harmless. Save your cigarette butts. Well, let's get him then. [Andre], get out. Dock M"!, you will be expected there. They will take you to Poland. That's your decision, yes? Of course. You always chose me. Here is your passport. You have to hurry up. It's new. Smells good. What if I refuse? Sonny, I'm on duty. And you're a nobody. Already forgotten? Every son dreams of hearing that from his father. All right, no further questions. - All right, let's go, Masha. - She's on duty too. Masha? Are you coming with me? Sorry. Good, I'm gone. People... No phone, no money. And I don't smoke. - Did you cause the power outage? - Is that the problem? Your father came to us on purpose. Comrades, I have to speak to the boss. When the power was gone, he told Kataev, that he must free Rakhmanova. Take Rakhmanova to Cell 14. - And Kataev helped him. - Kataev? First he wants to have youth and then he helps my father? Kind of strange, isn't it? The festival was no coincidence. - How did you find Rakhmanova? - At the parachute festival, I saw her there by accident. But you only approached online. And when youth seemed in danger did you show up to her and led her to your father. How did she know that my father was still alive? No idea. We will ask her. It's stuck. Her father lost her on purpose. The rescue brought him then her trust. - It was she who sold the youth. - Wait. Do you mean to say - that Masha is a traitor? - .Yes. Rakhmanova is a traitor. I have to get her out of here. - But why didn't he tell me that? - Well, you love her. That's why youth is my purpose in life. [The Secret Service has Andre]. That was fast. And I thought, I would have tricked Colonel Rodin. You thought what I wanted. When did you see through me? From the beginning. You never jumped with a parachute up to six months before the festival. Only you could Roman Popov persuade them to betray us. - He was in love with you too. - Have you been watching us the whole time? How did you know I'm still alive? Who taught us that death is for being an agent is just part of the job? - Understood. Well done. - And it's true. - Where are we going? - To Sonny. Is anyone alive - Maxim Mikhailovich, he was kidnapped. - Roger that. Let him go I'll tell you the passwords. - Well, let's say you do. - He'll take my car then and announces every five kilometers, that no one follows him. Every call means a password. The first password! [Andre]. Don't do stupid things, okay? Your phone is bugged by us. I'll miss you. [Andre]. Don't scratch the car. Sonny I'm on duty And you're a nobody. Already forgotten? you are a nobody I'm ready. Then we wait for our customer. I was expecting it to be in could give the youth a traitor. But not that you will be. I a traitor? You ruined my whole life. I thought, I found my family Colonel Rodin became my new father. I wanted to serve my country. And then came this stupid circus. "Wait for the order, I'm dying now." We were stuck like lab rats. We stood by for God knows what. We waited for an order. I didn't betray the youth. You betrayed us That was the order, you should wait. And how long should that go on? 20 years? - 30 years? - Maybe all life. Answer speak. Have you arrived safely? Do not shoot! I am, yes Everything OK. No scratches on the car. Dad, do you know what I'm thinking? Let them run Don't tell her any passwords. Come on! Shoot! Torture me What else do you want to do, hmm, Rakhmanova? I loved you. You will not be captured. Let her go. Is father alive? Do not you want to know, who shot? I'm telling you Our own people. Maybe even Kataev. You see we mean nothing to the secret service. Not even your father. [Andre], don't think that I betray the youth. I just want a normal life for us. All the years are not allowed have been in vain. You have to try remember your password. - I don't know. - Yes, you are. You just pushed it away. I never understood what you do when you are young. You were too slow you shot badly "Now I understand: Your strength was your memory. So you know the password, Andrei. Most certainly. You just have to remember. I'll give you an injection. This will help you remember. Sonny, what is the capital from France? I do not know that anymore. For real? Not even with the poem that goes with it? "Dad is French and says to his child: 'Let's be quick get some cheese out... "Paris!" "A German bought his Son clay for modeling. - The resulting city is called... - ...Berlin." "The resulting one City is called Berlin." One German, one city, clay. - What is that? - The password. One German, one city, clay. Good. And further. "'You are the best dad in the world', wrote the son in Cairo on papyrus." "A cowboy dreamed, his son would have left for Washington." "A Danish father picked up a pen and wrote to his son in Copenhagen." "An Indian father dragged one elephants to the capital Delhi." A Dane, a pen, Copenhagen. One cowboy, one son, Washington. An Indian, an elephant, Delhi. Papyrus, a son, Cairo. Good morning Do you recognize your classmates? Vova Sorokin. He works in Cairo. Lisa Zamyatina. She made a career in Spain. Arcady the American. Do you remember him I want to see her again But without a password they won't talk to me where are the passwords In here. [Andre], huh? Your father gave them to you definitely said, to be on the safe side. I believe you that you don't remember. Really I do. But we're running out of time. I'll help you remember. - I'm in position. - Okay wait. Carry out! Arcady the American you lived in vain What... what are you doing? You beast! You monsters! You monster, you! I... I don't know! I don't know any passwords! - Calm... - I... - Chill out. - I do not know anything. I only remember nursery rhymes which father made me memorize. At that time I was still small on this way should I memorize capitals. - And? - Your searched password stuck in one of those rhymes. only understand I don't understand the logic behind the selection, I don't understand the algorithm. I do not know anything. We must go to my father's house da... there must be a clue somewhere. - We have found nothing. - You should have looked more closely. Then look. Do you really think your father's things help you? I know the password that fast? - Do you want to dance? - Andrei... You're gonna kill me anyway. - Can you remember it? - I try it. "A Danish father picked up a pen and wrote to his son in Copenhagen." "'You are the best daddy in the world', wrote the son in Cairo on papyrus." "A Spanish father snores loudly, when his son is at the bullfight." I'm Andrei Rodin. The password for youth is now me. All commands work now directly from me. So call the customer, go ahead. You don't want to believe it. The password for the world's most important Secret organization is a nursery rhyme. Who is your customer? A leading businessman. I offered him my services. - And? - Back in London, you remember to the anti-Russian demonstration? That was a good argument for the sale of youth. You also know Roman Popov, our classmates. He was in love with me as well. I told him to unpack. I left him under the eyes of my client then kidnap. I later disposed of it. The Russians got the blame for that. There were sanctions. Many large companies left - my client's competitors. Then I met him. I explained to him that it was an agent. You? - Then he bought the whole group. - Why then? Because he wants to advance his business. Some of his stocks must fall others rise for it. And for that some have to people disappear Planes and ships fail. And you think youth will just run these commands like this? We were taught to give orders follow without asking questions. Oh yes? And how much do you get for it? Oh well... Now I understand the security check that my father had for you - 15 years. Now listen... - Don't you have any doubts about that? - Not at all, Andrei. And you? What do you want? Let's drive If you get me somehow crooked, I'll kill you Roger that? I am listening. - Wow, you speak Russian? - English will bring you money. For influence you need Russian. - I am listening. - A funny accent. "Influence". Go on. So sir, here's the deal: I am the password for youth. So I have conditions, three in total. First, 100 million euros. Second, all orders to the youth run over me. This is for my own safety You understand? And thirdly, They give me Masha. What am I getting? You will be the best have agents in the world. You will take every command run by you - every command I transmit. Really everyone? Absolutely everything. Yes! According to your tradition must the deal to be celebrated. But before that I would tell you like to show something else. Stop, zoom in there. Also a way to make yourself known. - A strange place for a shop. - But he fits this business. Everything is ready. The crew is on board. We can go as soon as you're done. Hi. Is everything ready here? - What is going on here? - Mr. and Mrs. Fedorov, two geniuses in the field of plastic surgery. Why are we actually here? And who are you? Explain it to him. Why do I have to deal with you? You say something but actually think very differently. The idea that you yourself do that Forgot the youth are is good. It only actually exists in the 21st century no more reason for direct contact. Can you a clone existing person? - .That's fine. - We need another man - with the same face. - Then I need at least a scan of his face. - Go ahead, scan. "The earlier the better. Your Masha is pregnant. Masha? Are you pregnant? - Is that true? - Yes, it is. Your child shouldn't growing up without a father, right? If you don't do what I say I will kill her and the baby. Congratulations, dad! Sorry. I need Masha alive. But as soon as when you're done with him, kill him. - It's now 4:38 p.m. - All right, I'll set my watch... - Our agent in Germany. - My sympathies. Please let me participate. If you want to avenge your husband then not. - No, I just want to finish it. - All right. They lead the land group. The landing point is here. I lead the group coming from the sea. They notice us first, your advantage. They lie near neutral waters, they must not make it there. - I have five minutes. - Two is enough. At the briefing on Monday, you resign all negotiations with the Russians. Very good. Everything has already been discussed. - Look straight ahead. - You know, nuclear peace in North Korea may be over abruptly. Your missiles can Reach your country easily. - Is that a threat? - No, that's not a threat, just food for thought. Not more. Think about it. CREATE POINT CLOUD Stop. No guard. Hey, come on, come on! - Are you alright? - Yes, of course. VOXELIZATION Hey redhead! In a word. Then let's talk. Where are you going Come on, get it done! - Masha. - Andrei. You will pay for everything. Do you want your child born in prison? Yes. I'll get it out then and raise it alone. Who shot my father? I had no choice. We did that in Angola when someone is captured. You have to shoot right here. The person then appears to be dead. Then.., then.., then.. is he alive? He's in a coma. You should hurry. None of us are getting any younger. He might not make it this time. Father forgive him. I thought I couldn't do it. I guess I wasn't your ideal son. But you were always my role model. Do you know what I'm really ashamed of? I was six or seven when I smoked my first cigarette. and you saw that I climbed in fear on a tree, the branches should hide me. You passed it and I thought you wouldn't have seen me I spent four hours in the tree. My butt went numb. I really thought you were killing me. But eventually I became tired of sitting and finally went home. I saw you there. You pretended so nothing would have happened. I'm ashamed of it to this day especially because I didn't dare something to say. You know when I have a son I will name him after you. And when he smokes his first cigarette I will act like you "Every father dreams of hearing that. Bring the youth together. I'll do it. Take care of him. How did you wake up from the coma? Bit by bit. It was me who shot you. I had no choice. Otherwise you would be drugged been and would have said anything. - Well done. - Definitely. Hey, hey, hey... Hey! I warn you. If you die again you're not my friend anymore OK, rest. M+A = youth [Youth, this is Andre] Rodin. It's time for a meeting.
