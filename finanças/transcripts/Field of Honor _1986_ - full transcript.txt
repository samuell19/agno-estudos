Don't you wanna go back home? I am home. Didn't even know where it was... Korea. [sighs] Well, you ain't waving goodbye yet. Still got a chance to kick off. [Tiny] Damn you, Sire! Don't say that to me. [Sire] You really care what they have for cold meat here or in Holland? Bullshit, I'm not listening. [groans] [Sire] Let's go, Tiny. The Chinese are waiting. A hole in your head, Sire. [blasts] [soft flute melody] [military drums] [Sire] Hey, Tiny. Aren't you the guy who plans to go back to Holland in two weeks? In 13 days. You buy the booze, I deliver the ladies. Just say where and when. What'd you say, sergeant? Well lieutenant, from the smell of it, I'd say somebody's brewing coffee over there. Chinese? [radio beeps] Applesan, we go looky-looky. Do me a favor, sir. All you have to do is listen. [rustling] Damn it! Where's that dog come from? Who's dog is this? Her name's Chippy. [suspenseful orchestral music] Sergeant De Koning has gone to take a look. Give him cover. [repeated clicks] [music swells] One more thing, sergeant. Shoot first, ask questions later. If we can see anyone, it's a Chink. Has to be. For Christ's sake, they can hear you all the way to Peking. -Listen! Just listen. -[barking] -Okay. -[Sire] Not even "okay". -And keep that dog quiet. -[dog whines] -Chippy! -[dog whining] [music fades] [tense music] [music swells] [barking and snarling] [door slams] [smacks lips] [whispers] Goddamn, Chippy!

[military drums] [indistinct shouting] [harmonica plays softly] -Where's the sergeant? -Just around the corner, sir. [grunts] Another thing, De Koning. I'd like to pass that for, uh... the little girl's mother. She's with shock in the hospital. Already lost her husband, you know? That's war. Sergeant? May I ask you a personal question? Why are you here? In Korea, I mean. Quite simple, sir. then Indonesia. Now this. [sighs] I missed that one... Indonesia. Otherwise you'd have been a captain by now. [barking] This is a battalion order, sergeant. No dogs. No sweat, I don't want her. Whatever. The dog must go, today! What's stopping you, sir? You have a carbine yourself. And bullets. I'd certainly do it... if it were my dog. [Sire] Chippy. Come here. After all, it's a battalion order. [melancholic music] [dog whines] [suspenseful music] [engine splutters] Goddamn it. [gearshaft rattles] Going back to town? Yeah, get in the back. -[gearshaft rattles] -[engine spluttering] [engine roars] [journalist] Sergeant? Hey, Sergeant? Why? What's it to you? I was journalist, so I'm curious. Now here's a story for you. See this dog? The best hunting dog in all Korea. A hound? A hound dog? From a mile away this dog can smell any whorehouse. [chuckles] You're kidding. Going to trade her. Trade? Why? Moving back to the front. Can I have the dog? -Trade. -For what? What do you have? What use is that to me? I can't type. Have a look anyway.

[engine whirrs] [Taihutu] Halt! -Password. -[Sire] That's my boy, Taihutu. Is that you, Sire? No, it's the Emperor of China. And I've come to conquer this damn country. -Who's there with you? -Applesan. [indistinct] ...has taken over. Applesan, come here. I appoint you my deputy, Sire II. You number ichi, bud. [glass bottle clinks] This won't make you sap happy, but it will sure keep up your courage. Oh... I've seen enough. You won't live much longer. Now, let's go. Farewell, Sire II! [chuckles] -How funny. -[soft click] That's not funny, Sire! [plays softly] [men humming] [door opens] Holy shit, Sire. What have you brought along? [Sire] Flesh pots. Ten dollars a go, and short time. Short time only, 'cause the driver is waiting. Any special reason for this? Depends who's planning to take the boat. You... or me? -My party! -[all cheer] [discordant music] I tried them both. And I like this one 'cause she really knows how to grind the coffee. Little Kim takes the bread in exchange for rubbers. I'll be a shit-eating son of a bitch. What is this, Korea's national anthem? Hey Sire, she really that good, mama-san? How do you want it, in black and white? He can read, I believe it Sire. I lay her, man. What do you mean you lay her? -I screwed mama-san. -Yeah, me too. -But I'm first. -Why are you first? Because I already got a hard-on. What about me? I'm ready to whitewash the whole goddamn ceiling. -Heads or tails? -Uh... tails. Hey, wait a minute, I was gonna say that. Tails. Okay, heads. -[Sire] Heads. -Yeah! [laughs] Okay, can I have one? [indistinct] All right. [man] Wait a minute. [man] Wait a minute. [man] Wait a minute, wait a minute! [background chatter] You worry me, you know that? Why? Tomorrow, we're moving up to the front, 'cause the Chinks are waiting for us. 'Cause you may be shipped home in a box, that's why. Couldn't it happen to anyone, Sire? Even you? Yeah but I'm not putting on a wooden kimono clean-handed. Give her the Dutch feed, Brammetje, nice and cool. Oh yes! Oh I'm cumming. [shouting] Oh shit! I'm cumming already. Whoa! Fuck, I'm cumming! [men cheer] [Leen] Now me. Watch... and see a ten minute wonder. Please Sire, I promised. Promised what? Never to go with a whore. Who did you promise? -God. -Who? God! Oh, it's okay then, 'cause God knows that these two are no Hershey bars. They're not... What are they then? -Are you satisfied? -[woman grunts] -[woman moaning] -Goddamn it! Come on, Leen! -[Leen] Shut up! -[Sire] Hurry up. [Leen and woman cry out] [Sire] You go outside right now, and then what do you do? I don't know, Sire. Spread it around we're having a whodang in here. And for whose sake will you do that? For yours, Sire? For theirs. The victims of war. If mama-san and her brood won't go on the gang, they'll be food for the worms. In other words, gang shagging these two is an act of charity. So help me God Almighty. And mama-san is yours. [Leen and woman gasp] If I really have to, Sire. You really have to. I'd rather have the girl. Bullshit. You've got to learn to ride, first, and that's what an old bike is for. Sire! The other one. Is she really such a cold fish? It's your party. See for yourself. Now me. Naked. I wanna do it naked. Buck naked. [cheers] [Leen] All right men, enter. Drinks and booze...

Don't tell me you found someone else to mess around with. Chippy, no! [Sire mumbles] I was to be back in Holland a month or so before I suddenly remembered that dog. And my mother said, "Oh, that dog's been dead a long time." Gives you some idea... how those Krauts roughed me up. If this keeps up, she can bite my throat. [sighs] Dogs do that, don't they, when they get hungry? In any case, I lost my locket. [wordlessly singing] [sighs] Finish me off, you stinking Chink. [medic murmuring] [medic] You American? That's none of your Goddamn business. I can speak English. You lucky dog. Yes! [laughing] [chuckles weakly] Me very strong. Wait. Wait! [groaning] [groans] [medic] See? Me strong.

Let me see how far the road takes us. [repeated thumps] 'Cause out here we haven't got a Chinaman's chance. [barking] -[barking] -[whispers] Quiet. [faint rumbling] I see, see? What do you see? Even as a kid I hated this game. -[barking] -A rat. Fuck you. [barks] Don't ever pull that one again, you nervous mutt. [thunder] Goddamn Chinese junk. [drops lighter] [thunder] [speaking German] [continues in German] I got to say that one time, and the bloody Kraut, he belted me another 30 right away. [thunder] To die of hunger... [chuckles] ...wouldn't that be a shame? [thunder] Chippy, down. [irregular breathing] Holy shit, the blanket! You were right, you old bone eater. We have neighbors. [sighs] Go chase yourself, I have to get fit for work. [panting] There you go, Sakahasi boy. Peace at last. If we stay, I make dog meat of him. But we're not staying. And I can't keep my eye on you and the horde of Chinks at the same time. Ah, Chippy. [grunting and groaning] It's nothing personal. But before I know shit, you'll have half the Chinese People's Army at my fucking door. Never say die you old bone eater. I'll be back before lunch.
