- Whoever sees this, mum, dad. What happened. None of it was anything to do with me. - Hey Holly. Are you going to make us famous? Depends if I sell the video. - You've shot loads. Tell me about it. - Yeah, shoot my load. Don't embarrass yourself. - You wish. - Dream on. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enough, enough. Holly, let's set up a group shot.

And then you were gone. - You can buy them from Vampire's Realm. Caps. I'm gonna get permanents. - My uncle, like, he's got this cool beach hut. Middle of nowhere. No one ever goes there. - Have you heard about that new mascara that's supposed to glow in the dark? - Yeah. I've got it on. - Well, how can it glow in the dark though, if it's black? - Why do you care? - I want to be her. - I wanna be in her. Cheers. - Whoo, whoa. - How am I supposed to get home from here? Use your bat wings. - Thanks. - Yeah, Flip-flip. Hey Holly. Er, how about letting me stay? Good night, Brad. - Promise I'll make you come. - Out! - Bye, Holly. - Night, Adam. Eddie! - Where's my kindred? They've gone. - Shit! Cheers! - Eddie's gone. Didn't you arrive with him? - Nice space. - Why were you videoing me at the club? - Why were you videoing me? - Thanks, really, but no, thanks. I just arrived in London. I don't have anywhere- - Haven't you got any friends you can stay with? - No. . Well, I'm sure you'll find a room somewhere. Bye then. Wait. - What? - Would you be in the documentary that I'm making? It's about the Weekend Vampire scene. - I'm not a Weekend Vampire. - It's okay. I just thought it could be interesting if you were involved. That's a sofa-bed. - Okay. - So where have you just come from? Spain. - What are we doing there? - Surviving. That for your documentary? - No, it's my video diary. Say hello. Hello. - You hungry? No. - You don't eat? You anorexic? No. - Did you go out somewhere last night? I had trouble sleeping. I went for a walk. - In the dark? - Have you always lived alone? There was someone. A boyfriend? - I let him move in. Didn't work out? - I got pregnant. - He wanted it and you didn't? No, I wanted it and he didn't. - Did you? But I lost it. Then I lost him. Thank God. - Hmm. - Why do you video? To meet people. - Wouldn't have thought you'd have had any trouble meeting people. - But with this, I can pick out the people that I want to meet. - If you wanted to film some real blood drinking the Sanges are meeting tonight. Can I bring someone? - What? You look terrific. Time to exchange. Sanguella, esta, vieta. Blood is the life. Haze? - Fuck. Have you heard? The rock music world tonight is in mourning. The body of popular clubland DJ, 31 year-old Eddie Strode was discovered at his flat today. Police are treating his death as suspicious. Eddie Strode was last seen leaving a London nightclub at 3:00 AM. Police would like to hear from anyone who might have information. - This is like just between you and me, and anyone else who's watching. The killer drunk Eddie's blood. Did y'know that? All of his blood! The full gallon. Fuck! What a way to go! That was Eddie for you. Live to the max, die to the max. Eddie? Can't believe it. - Sorry. - You trying to comfort me or fuck me? Shit! - There's no such thing as real vampires, is there? Well, except my parents and my uncle Serge, and, the government and the multi-nationals. Shit. When you think about it, who isn't a vampire? - They do exist Holly. Check out all the websites, the clubs. But those aren't real vampires. - How do you know? That's what your video should be about Holly, real vampires. - Police. When they were interviewing me all I could think about was how much I could make out of Eddie's murder. Did they interview you about Eddie? I didn't know him. - You arrived at my party with him. I followed you here and I waited outside, and when he arrived, I followed him in. - Why? - Why do you think? ♪ Don't hold on to the past ♪ ♪ These things weren't meant to last ♪ ♪ And walk into the light ♪ ♪ And come with me... ♪ - To Eddie Strode. - Shouldn't we be toasting him with blood? - Maybe that's not such a good idea, Haze.

I've never- - I know. - Don't turn it off. You're so hot. - So are you. I want you. Have you slept with straight women before? - Yeah. But if they're straight, why do they? - Because I'm not a woman.

You haven't heard from him have you? - So we were meant to hook up, but he never showed. - I saw Brad at the club. - Yeah? And you definitely haven't seen him since? - Maybe he dropped the acid. What acid? - Shit hot, vampire acid. He'll be tripping out somewhere. But Brad wouldn't do acid on his own. - Hey. She was there too. At the club. - I don't think so. Yeah with Brad.

Vicki the Vampire. Vicki the Vampire. She likes to drink blood. Moody. Just the way I like it. Hey! I'm not a piece of meat. You're something else, you. Go girl! Arrgh! Jesus! Fuck! You bit me! I'm bleeding all over! What's that?! Uh, huh! Before I call the police, I want to understand. - There's nothing to understand. You're a psychopath. - I'm a vampire. I'm a vampire, Holly. Vampires don't exist. It's not possible. - It's what I am! It wasn't supposed to happen. It wasn't supposed to be him, but he attacked me. You saw. - But Vicky- - I know. He didn't deserve that. Yes he did. Brad! - Why are you taping this? If anything goes wrong. - You mean if we're stopped? Maybe they'll understand how I got involved. - That's the reason is it? For now. - Sometimes it almost feels like they wanna die. I thought Brad wasn't supposed to die? - I meant the others. The others? - I'm a vampire, Holly. I do what I have to to survive. Wait. Fuck! Fuck! He isn't dead! - Do what you have to do. Call an ambulance. The police. It's over. - No. - What, you want me to do it? - No! - What do we do then? - We finish it. - Holly. - You heard. Finish it, do it. Holly. - I really thought that was it between us. Don't know what I would have done. - Adam's got the use of a beach house. It's along the coast somewhere. I thought maybe we could, sometime. Jesus, what am I thinking? - But I'd like that. I really would. Holly. I want to know everything, okay? Everything. - To the outside world, we were ordinary. Certainly, no-one would have guessed the truth in a million years. No-one could have guessed what really went on in that place. My mother. Your father? - Maybe, maybe not. They'd turn up and then move on. Men? Not men. Male vampires. And then my mother would get pregnant again. And my big sister. - She looks like a- - Like a hooker. I know. Vampires survive by living on the edge. With junkies, fascists, S&M scener's. The Weekend Vampire scene? - Anywhere vampire behavior won't stand out. First memory is of having my fangs removed, without anesthetic. You're born with fangs? - Four of them, it's the only way you'll recognize a real vampire. That's a better memory. About a few months after that was taken I was locked up for the first time, but they had to let me go. I was under-age. Nine. I didn't know I was doing anything wrong. I was a bad girl and I got worse. A lot worse. "But I like to scratch the other children, Mommy, and taste their blood." In the end I had to leave. Because you were drinking blood? - I left when I realized that the next time a male vampire turned up, it would be my turn. 14 years old and all alone in the world. But I grew up fast I hooked up with the worst people I could find. They use me. I use them. Brazil, Peru, Argentina. Feed, move on. Feed, move on. The hunger driving you all the time. Vampires. We spend our entire lives on the move. I always try to do it as humanely as possible. It's a bolt gun. That's what... Brad. They kill animals with them. Painlessly. Get them relaxed, and then... It's the kindest way. - Is it? - Around the world, they kill a billion creatures every year with these things. You eat meat, don't you? I'm vegetarian. - I don't have that choice. Couldn't you just drink their blood and let them live? - It's not possible. - Why not? - They'd struggle, fight, injure themselves, injure me. I really try not to hurt them any more than is necessary. I'm not a psychopath. How many have there been? - I don't keep count. Doesn't bother you? - No. Eddie, it was you wasn't it? It was Eddie's car that we used, that we used for Brad, wasn't it? CDs in the glove compartment could only be his. - Yes, but- - Did he try and rape you too? - I didn't- - Then what happened? - Holly. Eddie wanted to die. - Eddie wanted to die? - Yes. There's a tape. - The camcorder. Best sex toy ever invented. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Don't stop, don't stop. Fucking hell! You really do go all the way, don't you? Arrrgh! Arrgh. Jesus! Arrgh! Oh! - Why me? - Because unless we find a human, to care, protect, look after us, we won't make it. - Bitter. Like almond. Do I turn into a vampire now? - Yes! - No. That's bullshit isn't it? - You really don't want to be what I am. - When I was twelve I used to cut myself. - Vampires don't cut themselves. - Don't you? - Why did you? To make me feel better. You couldn't pay to have a childhood as fucked-up as mine. Nobody cared how I felt.

Brad was, is my friend. I'm worried about him. - Suits you. - Does it? No, I prefer you as you. - Why didn't you tell me? - Hmm. - You're hungry again, aren't you? - I'll be fine, really. - We'll find a way. - I can't. You can! Look... I'll try some and I'm vegetarian. - I hate you. Can't be good for me eating all that meat. Don't. - Male vampires. Could I have met one? - Of course you have. Tell me about them. - Vicki? Do you have to follow me around with that thing? What is it? Are you hungry again? - Yes! No, not yet. Next time we could try raw meat. - That won't help. - How do you know? - Because there's two of us to feed. It's okay Holly. I'm not insane. I'm pregnant. So you won't help me? So who was the father? - Does that matter? I think so. - It was a male vampire. Okay? He raped me. I'm telling the truth, Holly. Couldn't you stop him? He was out of control. You stopped Brad. Brad wasn't a male vampire. Couldn't you have called for help? In the animal world, there's nobody, nothing to protect you. How did he know you were a vampire? How do you think? He left me lying on a Spanish beach, naked, half dead. I wanted to kill myself. Now I wish I had. - Of course I'll help you. Police are searching for these two women disguised as nurses.

At least we'll know if he's okay. - They got any news on Eddie? - Like they'd tell me. - They think he was killed by real vampire. - No, some total psycho who thinks they're a vampire. You told me you saw her with Brad that night. - No, I made a mistake. Bye, Holly. - Take care, okay? See you around, Holly. - She suspects. - I know. It's not a problem is it? I mean she's so in love with you there's no danger of her going to the police is there? - Isn't there? - What? - If you wanted me to, you know? - No way! Do you understand? I can't anymore.

But you wouldn't leave me alone. Do it then. Kill me. - Why won't you leave me alone? How can I? The police are on to you. - I know. And now there really are two of us to feed. What am I.. we going to do? - Come here. - No. - You have to. - It's too risky. - But I'm healthy. - No, I won't be able to stop. You saw what happened with Eddie. - You mean you couldn't stop? You said Eddie wanted to die. Vicki! It's okay. I'm sorry. - Look, Brad's not the only person I'm concerned about. Is everything okay with you Holly? - You're fucked! We're fucked. Fuck, now what do we do? - Holly? You there? Come on. - You said you didn't want her round here. You said she mustn't see me like this. So why did you just ask her over? - I can't feed you anymore. I've nothing left. - So? You mean... We should... Haze? - I'm dying here. And if I die who will look after you? What choice do we have? Christ Holly, you look horrendous. You on crack or something? You know I don't do that stuff. - If you say so. Where's Vicki? - Out. - Where is she? - Dunno. - Shit. I really wanted to talk to her. How is she? - She's fine. - Fine? What the fuck does fine mean? - Haze? - I'm concerned about her. That running? - Yeah. - Maybe you should turn it off. - Why? - Because I think that we should talk about Vicki. And Eddie Strode, and Brad. - What about Eddie and Brad? - I came here to warn Vicki the police are looking for her. Why should the police be interested in Vicki? - Maybe because she's a real vampire. Why didn't you tell us? Or maybe you decided to keep Vicki all to yourself? Yeah? You know what you are, Holly? You're a sad, lonely case, with no friends and no life. No wonder you're keeping that thing running. A video about a real vampire. You'll be a star.
