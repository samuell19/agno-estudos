(somber drum beating) (dramatic music) -[Rower] Ben, keep hold of him! - I've got him. (anxious music) (horse whinnying) - Jeremy, can I help? - Yes Ma-Ma, we've got two bodies on here. - Mum, I think you best not-- - Careful Mrs. Poldark! (anxious music) - Bella you stop here. Clowance, go fetch Dr. Enys! We'll meet him back at the house! (anxious music) (water splashing) (knocking) -[Ross] Yes. - A letter for you Captain Poldark. - Oh yes. Thank you. - [Demelza Voiceover] My dear Ross, every day without you here gets longer. It seems you're so far away from us in London. We have a stranger here, a young man. Jeremy found him on a raft and brought him in. Ross, the boy seemed dead as the friend they'd found him with. What happened to their vessel we don't know. The seas can be cruel, that is known. (dramatic music) Jeremy says they've been holding each other, out there on the water, the dead on the living for days. (poignant music) The one we gave some ground to in the church yard, the other we thought we'd have to. We sent for Dr. Enys who came promptly as he does so much now Ross, for the sick and the hungry. Bella ran all the way with us. She's growing everyday Ross. - Whoa! Careful now. - My dear Demelza, you're wet through! - Less than he! - Indeed, but I shouldn't want you ill. Go on, (mumbles), Clowance! -[Jane] He'll need feeding if he's to live. - We all need feeding to live, Jane. - He must be kept warm, Jane can you bring more blankets? - We cleared his lungs sir. - Good. I think the angels half have him, we must dissuade them. Ladies! And yet he's a fighting man. - Aye, and a rogue, as plain as day. - And boys, hold him down if you can. (poignant music) (thumping) (grunting) It'll be sore for a while, but usable, if he lives. Pray that he will Jane, I know God listens to you. - Well someone has the sense to. (anxious music) - [Demelza Voiceover] If you could see Ross, how difficult it's become here. There's real hunger now in the village, and no custom for the mine. Jeremy's worked some of the old shafts as best he can. I don't know what we're to do. We'll see deaths here if the war doesn't end, and people are saying you favor it, and speak for it! Ross think of us! If there's anything you can say to Westminster to bring peace, but say it, and come home. (hooves clattering) - Ross! (chattering) My dear Ross Poldark! - Mr. Canning. - The town is abuzz about you Captain. I said you could gather some information and you couldn't even garner a French life or two in the process. - I was hoping not to be garnered myself. - I didn't expect you to fight. - We've worn down Will Grace as far as we can. I've even opened one of the old shafts, somewhat deeper me self. - Jeremy you shouldn't! - We have little choice mother! - And the ore? - Still weak, hardly worth bringing in. - Well where else can we cut? - There's nowhere left in Will Grace, without a more advanced steam engine. And there aren't the prospects to justify that. It's finished mum. - I've written to your father about it. - What can he say-- - We must ask him! - We'll close it! - We must ask him! It's not the mine Jeremy! (poignant music) It's not just the mine it's the village we have to consider! And the family! - Of course! - What for all these years, the Poldarks, we've always worked the mines here! - Father would only say what I'm saying, if he were here. - But he's not here! (birds cawing) (relaxing music) - Good day to you Mr. Cravenson. - It is indeed ma'am. - I believe Mr. Cravenson comes from Lancaster, mother. - That's a fine city as I've heard. - And he has a fine house there. - (sighs) Fine perhaps, not so lovely as here. - What is your business in Lancaster? - Shipping. The trade of the seas Mrs. Poldark. - What brought you half drowned to this beach then? - Master Poldark I believe, and his mother. And you, so they tell me. For which I'm grateful. (birds chirping) My vessel was bound for Cork, with flax I was trading but, unequal to the storm we met. A wave diss-masted us so we put to in lifeboats. (tense music) One of these turned over and all were lost from that. The mate, and myself, and a sailor, we kept a vigil on the waves. The mate was dead in a day. And the other... Well, he took longer. - I'm sorry for your friend. You may rest here, and ask for all that you wish. - I'm obliged. - Clowance? I'm sure Mr. Cravenson wishes to rest. - Perhaps we should as what he wishes? - You have these flowers to set, and you do it so well. Before they dry, Clowance. - It's bad news on the king I'm afraid. There's talk of poisons, and devils, and all sorts of hippocratic whatnot, but he's mad for good, and that's a fact. - Is it known? - Not officially, not yet. - But it's an end to the Tory government. - I fear it might be. Our prince in the wing (mumbles) declares himself a little louder to be a Whig and despiser of Tories. Warleggan. He has a big opposite dissuasion to us. A Whig and a peacemaker. And no doubt with an eye on his prospects. But you know him, of course. - George, yes, a Cornishman. Ha, but we shouldn't remind him of that here. - Sir George now I'm afraid. For services, I dare say to the crowns in his pocket. (chuckling) I would sometimes the king's hand were as unsteady as his mind. - I'm expected home, Mr. Canning. - But of course, the little (mumbles). First you report to Parliament. - And then? - The regency bit? If we can vote it out, we delay the ascension of that prize buffoon, retain the king's ministers, and proceed with the war to victory. (tense music) (coins jingling) (knocking) - Yes? - I thought you'd like some ale Mr. Cravenson. - I would. Thank you Miss Clowance. For saving my life. - You have my brother to thank. It's good ale Mr. Cravenson, mother commends it to you. - Well my thanks to her. (birds chirping) (tools clattering) - Just fool's gold. Strains of copper, a little tin. - Well have we enough to hold on? At least till there's new on the war? - Our mine's (mumbles) mother. - There's more people calling for peace now Jeremy. - I wish some of those closer to us were. - Perhaps if they could see-- - I think it a question of principle, mother. - Your father is principled Jeremy, you know that! - Yes, and we're all proud of him aren't we? - It is not wise to speak ill of him Jeremy to others, however we feel! - Perhaps it were best to feel nothing. (dramatic music) - Still here Poldark? I would have thought you'd hurried home. - There is the vote. - Ah yes, the vote. - I understand you've been knighted. Then I should bow more deeply to you, sir. - No, Ross, are we not countrymen, after all? - I saw one of our countrymen among the British lines known to us both, your stepson Sir George. A captain now, by the name of Jeffry Charles. Wishes you well. And asked after Tremwith, his inheritance. I informed him that you'd keep it for him, in decay. - It is, less than it was. - It was a fine house when your late wife was mistress of it. He said it a pity that-- - There's much to pity these days, Poldark. And there are more for each day of this war. I would trust your report to the gentlemen of the house accounts for that when you give it. - Oh there is much to be accounted for, Sir George. - Indeed. There is. - Good day, Sir George. Gentlemen. (anxious music) My dearest Demelza. Thank you for your letter, and please know that I would be with you if I could. It seems my duty to the nation requires me to spend more time in the company of those who serve little but themselves. Of the mine Demelza, I fear there is little more that we can do for those that live off it. (chickens clucking) (poignant music) - It's from London. I thought you'd be pleased. - I'll be pleased when he comes home. -[Jeremy] Mother? - (sighs) I'll speak to the men. - His duties. What about us mother, has he no duties here? - Perhaps the nation counts for more in his mind. - What nation, when everything's closed and the people ruined! - Oh Jeremy! Your father, he is principled, and he is strong! He does speak what he believes in, and we should believe in that! He'll fight sometimes when he feels he's right against everyone, we just have to cope that's all, till he comes home! - I'll speak to the men. It isn't fair they should blame you for this. - Oh we'll speak together. And we'll speak for Ross, and they can blame whom they like! (anxious music) (tense music) - He's a fine beast. You ride him well. -[Clarence] Thank you. - I've seen you, down on the beach. Like the wind. It's a wonder he don't stumble. - He won't. And you Mr. Cravenson, are you well now and taking the air? - Taking the air, indeed ma'am. I'm taking the air. Where are you riding him? - To Reed Graves. Our mine, it's good path. - And would you be liking some company? - I have company, as you noticed. - I could fancy a walk me self. - It isn't far Mr. Cravenson. (anxious music) (dramatic music) - This is splendid Ross. We'll send it to the prince. And I should like you to speak with him. He is willing to give audience. Simply tell him what you saw. And be courteous. - I shall be civil enough. (chattering) - We have no choice in the matter. The mine's finished. - Yeah! - So where's Poldark at? Why hadn't he turned up and stopped this war? - My father's in London now. - Yeah, I've heard. British glory and bugger us! (crowd chattering) - Yeah, right! - I'm sure my husband is acting in Westminster according to his conscience! - Acting for his own pocket, same as all of them! - You should take that back! Your remark to the lady, I said you shall take that back! - Oh yeah? And what's her to you? You've been staying there as I've heard! - Captain Poldark stands up for the honor of this country! Such as it is with the likes of you in it! And so should all of you! (discontented chattering) - There's always prizes for plunderers, eh? -[Crowd] Aye! (hits thudding) - Miss Clowance, I suggest you don't see! (shouting) - Listen to me! We can't dig what isn't there! - Wait till Ross gets back, he'll sort it all out, I promise you! - Ah, he's got a taste for London now! He ain't fit-- (scuffling) - It's not, it's not worth it fighting each other! - You heard what she said! What are you gonna do, riot? Now be off with you, before I set about you! Be off! - That's right! (discontented chattering) (poignant music) (tools clattering) - We don't need your trouble in this village, Mr. Cravenson. - I thought to be of help Mr. Carter. - It was none of your concern! - True. It's none of my concern Mr. Carter. - But you can tell me this. How your boat failed in a storm that never took place? (tense music) There's been no storm out there for weeks! - A strong wind and a bad boat. We all make mistakes. Perhaps you're making one now. - Ben he spoke for my father! - He doesn't know your father! - I know his son, that's enough for me! - The man's a liar. - And maybe you speak more than you should. - Ben speaks his mind Mr. Cravenson as I hope we all do. And as you can see affairs are not happy here. - I can see. And I'm sorry for that. Your family's been kind to me Mr. Poldark. And you Mr. Carter. If I can help, next time, it'll be to less trouble. (wind howling) - It used to be a Poldark mine. Wheal Leisure. We had some good copper tunnel. Then George Warleggon got it and closed it to keep the price up. And he put it about that she's barren. - But you think it's got more? - There's a few lines run up here. Not much, but they suggest a lode line south of the head. - Could you buy it back? - Warleggan wouldn't sell to the Poldarks, Stephen. - But if he did, he would lose a hole in the ground and we could get the village working again. - So, tell me of this young fellow. Fished from the sea I believe. Not a bad catch I think. - Well he's much improved. - But I shouldn't let Clowance have too much to do with him. A young man like that can effect a girl of her age. It certainly effects me. (giggling) It's a wonder you can be thinking of mining with a young man like that! - I've not considered his attributes Caroline, for shame! - For shame you should deny me a little teasing. (vigorous music) (hooves clattering) -[Driver] Come on! (mumbling) Whoa! More recently, master. They, they keep on chopping off them trees no sooner you've picked 'em off! - I can smell the house from here. Have we had rats? - Aye, but we've been at 'em! - I would have thought you'd both be better dressed on the anniversary of my wife's death! (waves crashing) (horse whinnying) - How did you find me? - I was looking for my brother. - He took the boat. Fishing I guess. (water splashing) - You don't say much do you? - You're much like your mother, Miss Clowance. - I should think none at all. Everyone says we have quite different faces, and our eyes. My ears are much-- - No, I mean, the way you are. You've got a grace and she's beautiful but, seems unaware of it. She don't know what stops a man's speaking when he looks at her. She's much admired. And so are you. I noticed that young, Ben Carter. He's a nice lad. Means somewhat to you does he? - I'm not sure why you ask. - Well perhaps it's none of my business. - Perhaps it is. - Perhaps. - I was just on my way to Tremwith. - What's that? - A quiet place. - I thought you were looking for Jeremy. - I was riding as I often do. As you know Mr. Cravenson, and I simply happened to notice you. - Sharp eyed, Miss Clowance. - I'll show you the gardens. Nothing so interesting as water of course. - Which way? - Up here. (tender music) Unused to horses Mr. Cravenson? - We don't get many at sea. (poignant music) (Clowance giggling) - I expect to see a caretaker. There's two of them. (caretakers chattering) They won't mind me but, they might not be so kind to you. (chuckling) - Well I might be kind to them. And you. There's something I should tell you. - Are you married? - No. - But you have admirers. - Plenty. None I admire so much. Well some I did, you know? - You don't? - I told Mrs. Poldark the ship we lost was mine. It's not so. I just worked on it, I don't own boats. And it wasn't a storm. - And you didn't mention this to look better in my mum's opinion. - I don't look so good now. But I don't want to be lying to you. And I don't want no secrets. (romantic music) - I'm not sure... I don't think we should be here, I'm sorry. - Clowance! - Please. - I didn't think, it wasn't my intention to... - I'd like to be alone. - We'll be alone then Miss Clowance. You be alone. (sorrowful music) - I'm sorry, I saw the door open, I didn't... - What do you want? - Nothing I... I should get some water. - No there's no need. - They'll die if-- - There's no need. Who are you? - Clowance, Poldark. I come here sometimes, to put flowers here. - Just, get out! - I'm sorry if I-- - Get out, get out! (dramatically tragic music) (poignant music) - I believe she's taken Nero to the beach. - Indeed. I've seen her there. - I take it you're feeling much improved. - Much improved Mrs. Poldark, thanks to you. And your family. - I just wondered, if you don't think it discourteous to ask, how long you intended staying here? - How long am I welcome? - (chuckles) I didn't realize you were so taken with this part of Cornwall Mr. Cravenson. - Oh there's much to be taken with here. - I'll ask Jeremy to speak to the taverner for you. They have rooms there. The clothes of my husband's you've been using, of course you're welcome to keep. - Well I thank you ma'am. I couldn't refuse what's good enough for your husband. We'll meet again, I'm sure. - I'm glad of it Mr. Cravenson. - I think ma'am perhaps you are. - I'll expect to change the room today then. (tense music) (thumping) - I took Nero along the coast. - I wasn't asking. - Where's Stephen? (tender music) - He's gone. - Gone? -[Jane] He took the clothes we've given him didn't he, and went off. - Where? - Wherever he came from, I suppose. (sorrowful music) - Clowance... Clowance! (hooves clattering) (birds chirping) (regal music) - Sir George! Glad you could make it! A shame you missed the morning ride! - It is, I was a little delayed. - We've got a ride for you, a fine gray. I'm sure you'll enjoy her. - I'm obliged. - I don't believe we've, uh... - George. Sir George Warleggan. - Warleggan? - A Cornishman. From London. - And what is it that you do in London? Do you represent? - I represent Lord Devereux. Um... - Lady Harriet. And are you of a war persuasion or a peace persuasion, Sir George? - A sensible persuasion, Lady Harriet. - Then we must talk further. - Indeed. I would be-- - Oh don't say enchanted. I've never seen a man enchanted in my life. -[Man] Sir George! - Excuse me. - She's a proud mare, but a fine flank, eh? - Indeed, I shall enjoy riding her. - It was not the horse that I referred to. Of course, if you are interested in further pursuance, there's always the sale, by auction, of various properties belonging to her. Very sad. Husband gambled everything. She'll miss the horse most. Dundee, it's called. I understand it holds some particular memories for her. (dogs barking) Her brother, the Duke of Leeds. Lady Harriet is honorable, and widowed, and penniless. Mount up. (pensive music) - Violet Kellow, Paul's sister. She works at the tavern. - I'll meet her then. Haven't we all need gold around the edge, Jeremy? I know where some's waiting, for the picking. The gold is mine Jeremy. There'd be some for you if you'd be willing to a little adventure. - By gold, what to you mean Stephen? - I mean about, more than Saint Mary's. - I understood your vessel was sunk. - Well it was, but we managed to get a lugger to shore. Two for picking it up, and one for taking yours back. - Does it belong to you Stephen? - It belongs to no one. The captain died and he owned it. The (mumbles) and we don't need her. (vigorous music) (dogs barking) - Enjoying the hunt, Sir George? - Indeed Madam. - I fear we've lost our quarry this time. - Perhaps. - Perhaps not. (hooves clattering) - I'll break your bones, you come here! - Warleggan's men! They've got an order, says we can't use the land for the fair! Or for nothing! - Whoa! (thumping) - Touch me and you'll hang! - You leave him be! - I've got a warrant! Warleggan owns Saint Claire, this is his property now! This land is for farming purposes, and not open to public right of anything! I got the papers here! (dramatic music) (crowd gasping) Best you keep out of this! It's none of your business! (hits thudding) (suspenseful music) (hooves clattering) (horse whinnying) (scuffling) (mumbling) - You don't have to do this! -[Bayley] All right! We'll see to him later! - Boy we haven't finished yet! You haven't been paying your rents! Warleggan will have you out of your houses too! (tragic music) - Thank you Miss. - You left us then? For any reason? - It was time to go Miss Clowance. - Go where? - I'm a sailor Miss Clowance. I don't stay long, nowhere. Haven't you figured that? (forlorn music) So what about it Jeremy? I get my boat and I get out. - That'll be good for all, eh? - I took you for brave Master Poldark. - I have responsibilities. What are the risks? - Only the seas, which you know well enough. - Captain Poldark. -[Ross] Your Royal Highness. - I've read your report. Execrable writing. I take it you're more of an orator. - Hardly sir. - Well, a man of action then, by all accounts. - By some accounts, My Lord. - We have something in common then. Apart from our love of the people. God bless them. Men of action. The difference is that you are, active, and I am cocooned, like a prized silk worm. But I was young you know, when this interminable war started. Young, and I watched the young men striding off to fight and die, and I saw myself sometimes, riding ahead of them. The smell of smoke in my face, cries of war in my ears. Riding, into battle. - It's a fine feeling sir. - I'm envied everything captain. I'm here to be envied. But I envy you. I have advisors to burn. Why did Canning send you to Portugal? - He felt My Lord that an independent opinion-- - No one's independent but a fool. Are you a fool Poldark? Perhaps you are. Then I should be wary of you and your, opinions. - When you have heard them sir. - Well I've suffered your writings. I should suffer your oratory too I suppose. Speak. -[Man] I want him to see me about um, a commission... - George! George, what are you doing? - Buying. -[Cary] Buying what? - Buying what's buyable, Uncle. Mills, factories, workshops. Brick dust and bankruptcy. - Have you gone out of your brains? - In them, clearly, very much in them. Nobody else is. When the Prince becomes Regent, the war consigned to the follies of history, and trade resumes, brick dust will be gold dust, and bankruptcy, wealth beyond measure! - I saw youths plucked from our mills here, dressed in a little soldier's cloth, fighting two, three Frenchmen, single handed, with a ferocity that drained the blood from our enemy's faces before they drained it from their guts. (Prince snoring) Sir! I, I have given my report. - Which I found most restful thank you. I understand this General Wellington fled the field again at Wusaco. - A tactical retreat sir. - Britain's do not retreat. - Except as a nation, sir? - Do not grow insolent in my indulgence of you Poldark. - Then perhaps we should accept the inevitable. And bow our knee to the tyrant. - My best advisors tell me this. - They are accustomed to bowing, sir. - Indeed sir. - There are those I hold dear in my beloved Cornwall, (tender music) that should eat again. Work again. There is indeed, much to be said for surrender. - Tactical retreat, Captain Poldark. You, know something of military matters. - I have said what I had to say. The destiny of our nation is with your Royal Highness. - And with Wellington, is it not? - Where he leads men follow. - To where does he lead? - To victory. - You're sure of that? An adventurer, such as I might have been. (bell ringing) - But, I'm (mumbles), I'm rather tired of the best of the French. To the king then, whoever he happens to think he is at the moment. (chuckling) - The king. - I'm intended to sail over to the Saleese, with Stephen Cravenson. I can't see harm in that. - I think you should be careful, how far you travel with Mr. Cravenson. What we know little of his background, and what we do know, I'm not entirely sure I like. - Should we be damned for background now Mother? - And Clowance, Dr. Enys and I have been invited to a society ball in London. We thought you might like to join us. You'll have an opportunity to meet people. - And we'd be glad of a traveling companion. - Well I think it's a very good idea, Clowance. - Thank you Jane. I think you must go, Clowance. (dramatic music) - That's the one. -[Jeremy] It's French. - It was French. - You privateered it? - I did. - I thought you said it was your boat? - I said it was nobody's boat. We chased her and brought her in here. Came out of the bay and two gunships came after us. They holed us enough to see us down. And we gave them a few holes too, and sent 'em home. Anyhow it's not the boat, it's the cargo. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) - You think she's sound? - Sound enough. (knocking) -[Jeremy] Brandy. French brandy. - You're getting there. - There's an excise tax on every (mumbles). They'd pay us well for this. - True. - Stephen? - But not well enough Jeremy. I could sell it for double on the coast. - But we could hang for it. - Being poor's hangable these days. That's the way it is. (regal music) -[Duke] Are you ready my dear? Your carriage is waiting. - Sir George Warleggan. - Oh, and what does he want? - He's bought my horse at the auction. And, he wants to make a gift of it to me. But what he wants isn't stated. - I see. - I shall refuse it of course. - Rather found of it, aren't you Harriet? - Yes. - And of him? - I think that remains to be seen. (dramatic music) - It's a letter. - So it would seem, Uncle Cary. - For you. (sniffing) It smells. - I believe they call it, perfume Uncle. - Its a woman isn't it? (suspenseful music) (water splashing) - You said it was your boat! - I said it was-- - I didn't know you privateered it! I didn't know there was bandy aboard! I didn't think she would start sinking on us. - So we'll fix it. Just as soon as I find somebody with an eye for profit. (suspenseful music) - Stephen. - Come on! (dramatic music) (gun firing) (grunting) (guns firing) I'll be slow, you make a run, go on! - I can't! - Go! (dramatic music) (guns firing) (panting) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (panting) (tender music) - You must be some kind of a slug or snail. - N-No mum, I.. -[Man] Look down! I think he jumped over! Go on! (pensive music) - Good evening gentlemen. - Evening Miss. - Have you come to raid our vegetables? - No, we're Gagers ma'am. (pensive music) We're about looking for a couple of smugglers. -[Woman] I certainly haven't seen anyone. -[Gager] Well, he's dangerous, maybe if we have a look-- - I assure you, I haven't seen anyone. - All right, thank you Miss. - Are you a smuggler? - No, well... - Well? What is your name? - Jeremy Poldark. - And where are your friends, Jeremy Poldark? - Well he was injured, we separated. We had a lugger, but it was taking in water. - I did see a lugger, sailing rather badly. Could that be it? (melancholy music) Obviously not that injured. So, what are we to do with you now? And, I think, my help deserves something. Don't you? - Miss? - Miss Cuby. A kiss? It's not every day I meet a rogue. (chamber music) - Lady Harriet. - My benefactor. - My Lady, if you would allow it? - I accept the horse Sir George, and thank you for it. But the money I sent you acknowledges that which is most fine about the gift. - I understand the horse meant a great deal to you. - Indeed. He broke my husband's neck. - He's a fine hunter. - Well bred. But then, mixing livestock is an art, is it not? - Clowance Poldark, Lord Edward Fitzmaurice. - My Lady. Clowance, that is a pretty name, but unusual. - It's a Cornish name, sir. - Indeed, as Poldark is. - Do you know of us? - I've met your father. Of course I know of him, he's much respected. And how do you like London, Miss Poldark? - Very fine, what I've seen of it. - Could you tolerate a life here, as we have to? - I think I'd miss Cornwall. I'd miss the sea Lord Edward, I do love to swim. - How, does a lady swim in the sea? - In the sea there's little choice but to swim. - It is a rather beautiful part of the world they live in, Lord Edward, you should visit it some day. - Indeed, I now think there is much to visit. Miss Clowance? I wonder if I might ask you the pleasure of this dance? - Thank you. (chamber music) - I shouldn't smile so much. It scars me. - Oh, it all scars us mum. But you still look a picture, you do. - Oh I weather it well for a miner's daughter. So, this is how it must be, when the children have gone. Husband's away and we sit here. - You married the man, you knew what he's like. - I married the man, not a sweet word in the post. (chamber music) (applauding) (chattering) - I expect him to make an announcement tonight. - Yes, I thought I should be here. (pleasant music) - Captain Poldark? - Clowance? It is Clowance! - Oh, poppa! - It's astonishing! And, you look, (sighs), well who persuaded you to come here tonight? - What persuasion would I need? (sighing) Well the last time I saw you, you were in bare feet, happy to scamper about on a beach! - And the next time too I should think. (chamber music) - Lords, Ladies, and gentlemen, your attention. Your attention please! We have word from Westminster, conveyed by my two honorable friends, the Prince of Wales, God save him, has become Regent. (chattering) The details, the details, Lords and Ladies! The Whigs are denied office. The Prince has decided to retain the Tory government. And the war, the war goes on. (somber music) - Were you hoping for office, Sir George? - No, I, I have my principle interests in commerce. - So it matters little to you? - Little. Little enough. Lady Harriet I must attend to some urgent matters. - Well I shall be unattended! - I'm sorry for that, excuse me. - Jeremy what happened at the Saleese? - Stephen obtained his boat as he wished, and took it and left. - Something disappoints you. He was a man of some charm, Jeremy. He lives more by his wits than his conscience. - Perhaps he has to. I met someone. (melancholy music) A young lady. - Who is she? Do I know of her family? - Cuby, Trevanion. - Well they're a powerful people Jeremy. - And we're not? - They might have their views on what we are. - I was thinking to visit her. - Perhaps you'll convey our invitation to her to visit us. I think you're taken with her. - I feel, some liking mother. - If it helps Jeremy, you're not the first to feel it. Though you might think you're the only one. I've known it too. (hooves clattering) - 6000 pounds. 6000, that's in three days we've lost. - A loss in confidence, that's all. - Banks, banks are built on confidence! It's all wrong, it's all wrong! - A slight drain, we shall be sound Cary, we continue as normal. - Normal? You're not normal! What happened? You got the smell of a filly in you, didn't you? Yeah, and you closed your eyes, imagined her naked, and figured the cost eh? And you've ru-- - Enough! - Ruined us, for some perfumed petticoat! - Do not speak of her, don't even speak Uncle Cary! You befoul everything with your filthy mouth! I demand silence from you! (serene music) - Good afternoon Miss Cuby. - Good afternoon sir. - I've just spoken with your brother. He tells me you cannot receive visitors today since you are in Truva. I trust you find it a pleasant place. - Have you come here to tease me Mr. Poldark? - I did not come to tease you. - Then why? - You know why. - I fear I don't. You shall have to tell me. - You led me to believe that I would be-- - You believe what you want to believe. I said nothing to that effect. - You kissed me. - I cannot recall. - Cuby, if there is something, if I've done something, in my family it is always considered better to be forthright. - Your family is respected, your father admired. But you have too little of the land and even less of the mine. Jeremy, I have to do what I'm told. And I'm told you are nothing to me. So you are nothing to me. - Cuby. I... I just want to be with you. - I'm so sorry that you do. (sad music) (coach clattering) - Jane! -[Dwight] Greetings, ladies! -[Jane] Welcome back Clowance! - Dwight! It's so good of you. (expectant music) So... - It's just the same. - Get these things inside. Jeremy's out at Pleasant Country but I'm (mumbles). - We missed you. - I've missed you. (poignant music) My beautiful Bella! - And is the war to continue father? - It would seem so Jeremy, hard as it may be. And I'm sorry for it. - But you stood for it? - And it needs to be. But if the war ends, it doesn't mean that poverty will. Tell me of the mine Jeremy. - Very weak. We tried to extend the 60-fathom level, but, found nothing of any value. - It's unsafe. - I took the risk. - Alone? - With Ben Carter. - Jeremy then you were reckless with his life! And that is not done! We can only be courageous for ourselves! - Unless it be war. - I spoke of mines. - Father, I had to do something! - And we shall! We must look to our other financial interests. - We've always mined! - What happened to the young man you wrote of? - Stephen Cravenson. -[Demelza] Jeremy had quite an adventure with him. - Would you excuse me please, I'm rather tired. - Yes, yes of course. - Goodnight. - Father, mother, I'm also a little, tired. I wonder if I... - Oh as you wish. - Goodnight Jeremy. It's good to see you. Really. We'll talk tomorrow. - Yes. Sir. - Our children have grown forthright in my absence. - They've learned to govern in your absence, Ross. - I think Clowance is a little taken with a young man. His name is Lord Edward Fitzmaurice. She should see him if he requests it. - She may not wish to. (sighing) Oh Ross. It is neither war, nor Westminster here. (sighing) He's needed his father, Ross. So have I. (expectant music) - You have me now. - I used to wonder, while you were away, how I'd feel when I saw you. I feel the way I always feel when I see you. - You didn't say much. - We shouldn't have to. Candle's dying. - Good. I shall mourn it tomorrow. (romantic music) (waves crashing) (poignant music) I've always thought, that whatever else lets us down, the land won't. That our riches came from there, from what we made of it. And, I suppose, a little sentimentally, I've always thought that because I love this land, it would always love me. - It felt like killing something when we closed the mine. - Jeremy, I heard something about a young lady, a Trevanion. Cuby Trevanion, isn't it? I met her once, though she was very young then. I was in the same boat once. Perhaps I should call it a shipwreck. I loved, and lost, but I found-- - Someone better. - What happened? - It seems we're not good enough. Poldark's you know, we're not connected, we're not capital. - Never be ashamed of who you are Jeremy. You give me courage, honesty, and a clear soul over lineage every time. But if you want to know what the Trevanions want Jeremy, it's money. They'd have you in church by tomorrow if your pockets jingled. - Well I think we ought to reply to Lord Edward. - I think he should come and favor or land. This one's all right. With a few ribbons it would do for the fair, anyway. - And do you? Do you wish him to visit? - If he's traveling to Cornwall anyway I shan't object. I've never met someone so charming mother. It's not that he's Lord Edward, it isn't, he's sweet. - Stephen's. - Yes I think so. I dare say it'll make some old rag. - Could you be Lady Clowance? - And everyone awkward before me? I should be most gracious. (laughing) Mother I think you shall like him. And he shall like you. - I understand Sir George Warleggan is in financial difficulties. Doctor Enys was saying. - I don't think Sir George would sell Wheal Leisure. - Ben thinks he ought to be further down. If we sunk a shaft southwards. - It's flooded. - Not heavily. - It can't be drained. - We could pump it. - To build a steam pump strong enough would be a huge expense. - We could build one ourselves father. - Even Trevithick who knows more about steam than anyone burned three people in London. - That was years ago! It will be costly to build an engine father, but it won't cost lives, I promise you. - If you need money to win a lady Jeremy, you should perhaps think of some other way. - It's not about that! It's about not giving up! And you know about that, father. (regal music) (children laughing) (cart clattering) - We have Warleg and his baylies back again Jeremy. Trying to stop this again. They had the warrant. - What happened? - We had some help. Hired from hell. - I'm always to be found where trouble is, Master Poldark. - That is undoubted. Your leg wound (mumbles) to not preclude your ability to master the lugger single-handed. - My leg wound gave us space, Jeremy. They could'a got me, but it seems the best way of saving the boat. - Which is now where? - Sold in Bristol. I've got your share for you. -[Jeremy] Keep it. - Jeremy I'll be straight with you. I thought to sell the cargo, keep the money and make a life for me somewhere. I didn't want the come back here. - So why did you. - Damned if I know. Jeremy, you've been good to me. You and your family and, well that's not something I've had much of before. (somber music) - It's rare enough Stephen. - I heard some good news Jeremy, about Clowance. She's being wooed by a Lord now. Always said she'd be a Lady, fine houses and carriages. - I understand he's a fine young man. - I'm sure he is Jeremy. - Good and dry Jeremy. We'll torch the clouds, eh? - How dare the Trevanions speak so to Jeremy! They do nothing for the land, nothing for the country! - I'm glad we have more principle Ross. With Clowance. She may choose whom she marries. - She seems quite taken with Lord Edward. - For anything more we can't force on her. - She would do well to consider it. - Doing well isn't what matters. - She must be sensible, Demelza, as we must be! If she marries some boy from the village, however charming, she can't look to us! I feel we can't offer her much now! - She asks only for love. - Is it enough? - I remember one for whom it was. Jeremy dreams of Wheal Leisure, of returning it to us. - Warleggan wouldn't sell to me. There's a meeting at the bank in a day or so. It is suggested we speak frankly of George. He's in difficulties now. If we suggested his bank was, unsound, it would collapse. - Ross! Do you hate him so much? - I have good reason to. - And this would be the end of it? - There are many would thank us. - Ross you're not hateful! And it wouldn't end anything. He'd wait! He'd wait to ruin you! He'd beg and scheme behind us all the time, waiting for his chance. And then he'll hurt you, and you'll hate him a little more, and on it goes. We could be free of it! - Perhaps. - Oh speak to him! If you persuaded the bank to endorse his position, he might sell Wheal Leisure to us in return! What choice would he have? (birds chirping) - The price of these advances can be high. - Aye. I lost one of my own sons Captain, don't you know. - I think the dangers have passed. And once the real power of the engines is harnessed, they'll change everything, not just in mining or industry, work on locomotive transport machines could revolutionize the country. - It is in the nature of this country that revolutions are more spoken of than happen. - Hear what Mr. Harvey has to say. - Don't listen to me Captain, there's your engineer. (wind howling) - Could you make an engine, Jeremy? - I could design it. We could check it with engineers. I could build it. If we had a mine. (optimistic vigorous music) - Stop! - But I should wish to explain Lady Harriet, the circumstances by which I was forced to leave you so abruptly. - Indeed, were you forced to do so? - Lady Harriet, I made such a fool of myself for one reason only, to improve myself, that I might be more worthy of your hand. My wealth is restored, somewhat. I've spoken with your brother again and has examined such resources as I possess. - You know I find nothing so tedious as matters of commerce. - I do not speak of commerce now, Lady Harriet. - I think you do. And I think it insulting. (poignant music) - Insulting? - That you should be haggling a price over me. That you should think you can buy me, like a horse! (cheerful music) -[Edward] Miss Poldark! - Lord Edward! What brings you here, I really didn't expect-- - I hope you don't think me impertinent Clowance! I saw you on the road, and I-- - I'm delighted. - Then, you know what brings me here. I wrote to say that I expected to visit. - Yes we received that. If I had expected you today Lord Edward I'm sure I would have-- - Clowance do call me Edward. I think the protocols of court are belittled somewhat by the surroundings. And it's apt to see you here, in the place you love. You spoke of it, you remembering? -[Clowance] Yes, I do. - I can remember every word we spoke. And I spent every moment since doing little but remember. -[Clowance] It's a little cold for swimming now! -[Edward] But we should do homage somehow. (Clowance giggling) They dressed me as the visiting gentleman. Ah! (water splashing) - How is it? - Marvelous, (water splashing) and very wet! - Do they want you? Why are they watching? - It's what they do. But it is a little cold. - Would you go further? - I shall learn to. Now this, is something I've always wanted to do. Perhaps it takes a little practice. (melancholy music) - Poldark. - Sir George. - I take it you've come to gloat. - I cannot help it a little. - Indulge yourself Captain. It may be your last luxury. I see now Captain, your intent. Your bank has a covetable commodity has it not? The reputation of mine to ruin or elevate as it wishes. - We are considering the question. - Well yes, I'm sure you are. And did you hope I should beg? I'll see you ruined, Poldark. - What do you want, Mr. Poldark? - I am possessed of a little sentiment. My family prevails upon me to make an offer, on Wheal Leisure. - Sentiment? - For what used to be a Poldark mine. For the villagers you threw off it for no better reason than your own petty profit, closing a good mine to keep the price up? Sentiments, for those that starve. For you, and a hole in the ground. - A hole into which you might fall, Poldark. (sighing) - In return, my bank will provide the references your own enterprise requires to maintain the confidence of solvency. - I would see you in Hell. - In time you will. - Poldark! What price? - 150 pounds. - (chuckles) He'll be in Hell before yee George! Keeping it warm, he'll be. - Furthermore, you shall desist from your eviction of the villagers, and their rents which are little enough to you, shall be deferred. - The last time, Captain Poldark, we will do business. (regal music) (festive music) (cheering) (applauding) - Oh Lord Jesus Christ! Oh Lord, Jesus Christ! The true light who doth enlighten every man that cometh into this world, do thou bless this bonfire, which we gladly give to thee! (chattering) - Speech! - Yes Mrs. Poldark we'd be grateful of it. - You must mum. (speaking foreign language) (romantic music) (speaking foreign language) (cheering) (applauding) - You're looking very fine this evening, (festive folk music) Miss Clowance. - (mumbles) fine, Ben. - Would you consider taking a walk with me? - I'd be delighted. - My lady, would you consider allowing me to accompany you for this evening? - You're not the first to ask, Ross Poldark, but you're the first dance. - And have (mumbles). (flames crackling) (festive folk music) (clapping) (festive folk music) - My thinking is, this is perfect Miss Clowance. - I think it is Ben. - Mr. Cravenson. - I wish to dance, Ben! Is there a lady you have there? - Fair as day Miss Poldark. It's a fine man you have. Glad you're keeping in with peasants. - You've not seen the church (mumbles). Haven't you? - Being a religious man, I reckon I ought. It's a bit late for that now isn't it? Excuse me. (wind howling) (flames crackling) (waves crashing) - What do you want? - Nothing! I'm taking the air! - Left your little village girl, did you? - I came after you Clowance! Of course, you got Ben Carter now! And a Lord tomorrow, is it? You get tired of him I'll give you some names! - You've had your air, get out of here! You don't belong here! - I'll get out. A few more flowers to pick in the village first! - We should have let you drown! - Yeah. I could have done better in Hell! (tragic music) (hands thudding) (melancholy music)
