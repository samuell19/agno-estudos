â€˜Some day in lifeâ€¦â€™ â€˜Everyone will take a pause in some situation.â€™ â€˜I am in that situation right now.â€™ â€˜There might be many reasons but my reason is love.â€™ â€˜Tiding waves are beautiful to gaze.â€™ â€˜Involuntary dreams are good to experience.â€™ â€˜But, it isnâ€™t good when a girl who touches my heart and leaves.â€™ â€˜It wonâ€™t be good at all.â€™ [MUSIC] Ohâ€¦I am sorry, dear. â€˜All I know about love is itâ€™s spelling.â€™ â€˜I donâ€™t know about how it feels.â€™ â€˜I felt something like that for the first time when I saw her.â€™ Dad! Didnâ€™t you follow me? See! I fell down because of you. Why did you take your hands off the bicycle? I asked you to follow me, right? You asked me to let go. You asked me to let go on a count of 10 after you balance. I counted and let it go in a thought that you balanced. You fell down as usual. - Dad! I didnâ€™t ask you to count in your mind. You should count aloud. â€“ Oh! Do you know how hard it is to learn a bicycle? You will not understand. I know what you mean. You are thinking that I canâ€™t learn bicycle when kids can even do skating. Skating is easy... You can learn in one day. Cycling is very difficult... I know that. Shall I say something? I actually moved it a little bit. You balanced and came this far. - Really? - Seriously, Ankitha! You came all alone. Actuallyâ€¦ â€“ You act as if sheâ€™s flying an aircraft. The count is 99. She will reach 100 if she falls down one more time. Are you crazy? It is 94 times. You are very sincere with counting. - Hey! - So, you will fall down for another 6 times. You will definitely reach 100. Hey! You go and start the car. Letâ€™s go. Hey! Put your seat belt on. How many times should I say? â€˜Why will I put on seat belt when I donâ€™t wear belt on my pants?â€™ Hey! Slowâ€¦ â€“ Slow. What happened, sir? â€“ Speed breaker! Why did you stop the car when I asked you to slow down? I cannot do this, sir. Stop overacting... Drive. â€˜Whatâ€™s the use of hiring me if you direct me how to drive?â€™ Daddy! Letâ€™s fire Srinu. I will drive the car. Thatâ€™s a very good idea. First learn cycling without falling down. Then, you can think about the car. - Hey... Shut up. - Daddy! â€˜What else can I do? I will do.â€™ Daddy. Heyâ€¦what are you doing? Whatâ€™s that speed? Slow down. Gosh! It is like speeding for you? You say Iâ€™m speeding for just 40 â€“ 50 kmph. What would you say for 100 â€“ 120 kmph. Youâ€™ve been talking too much after increase in your salary. Hush! It's okay even if you donâ€™t increase my salary. Let me drive by speeding a little. It is my goal to drive with speed since childhood. That wonâ€™t happen until you drive this vehicle. â€˜I am trapped because of signing that agreement.â€™ [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MORNING MANTRA] â€˜That girl is like an angel... I can't forget her.â€™ Hi. What brings you here? Are you hurt? What are you doing here? Wounds? - Something happened to him. - Did you start again? Stand properly. No evil eyes shall be upon you! Are you done? Spit. Hey! Spit here. Wait! I will bring ruddy water. No ruddy water. Bring me coffee. â€˜This is my sister Roshini.â€™ â€˜She shares everything on social media and enjoys.â€™ â€˜I share both my happy and sad emotions with her.â€™ Heyâ€¦ Let us do a quick dubsmash. When is your exam? Next week. You have exams next week. But, you are on Facebook, whatsapp and dubsmash without studying. Did you even try to study? Why do you need Facebook? - He started it again. - Go and study. Get lost. Idiot. She wants everything! What now? Will you share this on FB? I donâ€™t have freedom because of him. What did you say to her? - Why is she like that? - I donâ€™t know. You ask her. Hey, idiot. What is he doing? How can address your father like that? Okay. Father! Your father has some project work. Why donâ€™t you help him? No way. Donâ€™t involve me in such things. I have important works than that. Whatâ€™s that? â€˜His name is Sudha.â€™ â€˜No matter what someone says or what he seesâ€¦â€™ â€˜He starts boasting about his village.â€™ â€˜He is DJ. Talks less and more into music.â€™ â€˜His ambition is to become a Telugu rapper.â€™ Tea. [RAPPING] How is it? Nothing more than a spicy snack! - Tea is awesome... - This is nothing. One guy in our village bus stand makes tea. It will be extraordinary. - What is it? - Go to your village and drink. This should happen to him. Where is Satya? Heâ€™s works for a software company in Hyderabad. Heâ€™ll be somewhere around there. Where are you? I am in Hyderabad, buddy. Hi-tech city! What are you doing there? Iâ€™m into software, right? Day shifts, night shifts, project deadlines and client meetings. - I am busy. - Stop over acting. You can work in Vizag also... Come here. I cannot come. Iâ€™d be angry if you do not come here by tomorrow. Why did you ask me to come immediately? - Why are you jogging like never before? - Youâ€™ve put on weight these days. Do you work pressure? I was heavy earlier too but you didnâ€™t notice. Not in the early morning, bro. Letâ€™s schedule it at 10 or 11. It will be peaceful. - Okayâ€¦ Pack your lunch and come at 1. â€˜This guy is Satya.â€™ â€˜He says that heâ€™s into software.â€™ â€˜His uncle promised to give his daughter in marriage only to a software guy.â€™ â€˜He knows that he cannot get into software field.â€™ â€˜He did some courses and got a job through back door.â€™ â€˜Those people kicked him out due to lack of skills.â€™ â€˜Since then, he tricks everyone with fake ID and fake language.â€™ - Is this jogging? - Yes. - Can you see that hill? - Yeah. Go there and come back. Are you kidding me? I will not go. Anyway, it is hard to lose weight in a day. Go, man! Go! She will be here very soon. Crazy idiot! I always have people like him around me. [MUSIC] Buddy! What an improvement in just a day! It was good, buddy. It feels relaxing. - It will be. - Tell me. Any time from tomorrowâ€¦ - I will tell you. - Letâ€™s do it. Let's go... We are done for today. What happened to you? Why did you go for jogging like never before? Will you always be on Facebook and Whatsapp? Do you know what Facebook creator said? How would I know? He said that jogging is his success secret. - He has gone mad. - You donâ€™t know anything. Go! Hey! Wonâ€™t you come? Go away. I donâ€™t understand him. Hey! Who are you looking for? Goâ€¦ [PHONE RINGING] Excuse me. Yes, Ankitha. Dad! Where are you? I am at the site. - Are you busy? - No... Tell me. Can you come home once? I will come right away. Okay. - Okay, dad. Bye. - Bye. Nice. How do you do this? We do it by placing sugar. We should rotate this wheel to make it. Is it made out of sugar? Show meâ€¦ Give me one more. Wow. â€˜I thought it would be a good sale. I am trapped. My neck hurts.â€™ One moreâ€¦ Iâ€™m done! -What is it? - Dad! Did you see this? Candy is made out of sugar. Does sugar make candy? Wow! It is very interesting. Fantastic! Why do you react just like your daughter, sir? I am selling candy here. She said that sheâ€™d buy all of it if I tell her how I make it. I thought Iâ€™d go watch Pawan Kalyan new movie if she pays. She doesnâ€™t leave me alone. I am out of sugar that I brought. She asks how it is made. You tell her sir. if you donâ€™t know how to do... Why are you selling it? â€˜He started too.â€™ Daddy! Sugar becomes powder in machine. Will it become this? Wow! I ate this many times when I was young. Iâ€™ve never had this idea like you. - You are a genius. - Really? Gosh! You are engineerâ€™s daughter. Go away, man. What an ideal family! I will never come here again. â€˜I should have spoke with her.â€™ â€˜I missed the chance.â€™ â€˜I didnâ€™t see her for 4 days.â€™ â€˜I have no idea where she stays.â€™ â€˜I wish she comes today.â€™ What are you thinking about? I am disturbed. Just leave me alone. Donâ€™t irritate me. - Irritating fellow! - Right! No one is serene due to pollution. Public donâ€™t feel responsible. They smoke wherever they are. Come. - Where are we going? - Shut up and come. Give me some clarity. I am unnecessarily having unwanted people around. Stop the bike. I will get down. - Wait. You can jump. - Stop! I will get down. - You are insulting me. - Wait, dude. - I will pick you up after my work. - No problemâ€¦ I will come with Jo. - Okay. - Okay? - Bye. - Bye. Is it right or left? Hey! Where to? â€“ No! Straight! He's torturing me. - I will call you later. - She must be somewhere around. I have to talk with her today at any cost. - I should miss this time. Wait. - Hey! Why did you bring me here? Whom is he searching? Move aside. Hey! It's Jyothi. Oh no no! It is definitely Jyothi if I am scared. Hey... Stop overacting. Nothing like that. - I think she lost some weight.? - Oh! Is it? She lost around three-fourth. Canâ€™t you see? Why will be like this if I lost 30 kilos? Not 30, it is 750 grams... Three-fourth of a kilo. - What are you doing here? - We are here to meet you. Why did you come for Jyothi? Call me Jo. [BOYS]: It seems Jo! She didnâ€™t change. It is suspicious to know that you are here for me. Jo. Gosh! Look at this painting. Abhi! Come. He is my junior in college. - Hi. - Abhi! Hi... I am Ankitha. â€˜Such a burden!â€™ Abhi. Ankitha. Satya! I am software engineer from Wipro. What? Are you into software? - I'll just be back. - Okay. He is one who drew that painting. Explain this painting to her. - Okay. - I will be back in 5 minutes. Okay? Okay. This is an abstract painting. Every one will have a different perspective. These lines and colorsâ€¦ This color is exactly like the glow in your face. - Everything will be different. - Whatâ€™s going on? Why are talking about college instead of the painting? It is not about the college, sir. I am explaining the painting. - Ask her. - He explained it very well. A guy would say like that. Why would you say that? You know me, right? I never show interest towards girls. I was telling her because she was interested. Your interest is much better than hers. Lighter! Where are you working? Wipro. Oh! - What about you? - Same! - Do you work for Wipro? - Yeah. - Which shift? - Morning. Oh! I have night shift. Okay... That is why we never met. Otherwise, we would have. - Hey. - Wipro. Who is your team lead? - Madhu. - Madhu? Madhapalli Madhu? - Anakapalli Madhu. - Anakapalli Madhu? - Is he there too? - Yeah. - We were roommates in Ameerpet. - Okay. So, I asked him to join the course for 5000 rupees for a good future. He doesnâ€™t even attend my calls. Heâ€™s a guy without gratefulness. No gratitude at all. - Is it? - He is overacting. Hey. Come. - Heâ€™s my close friend. - Same company? No! He is not a software guy. He is good for nothing. He has no goals in life. I am the only software guy in my gang. - Bye. Letâ€™s meet in Hyderabad. - Bye. [BIKE REVVING] Slowlyâ€¦ Hey! When shall we meet again? It is your wish. Give me your mobile number. Hey! Did you like my painting? I will dedicate the college if you want, not just the painting. Stop there.... Letâ€™s have a smoke. Girls are too trendy these days. Yes, buddy! I feel the same. Excuse me. Do you have lighter? Whatâ€™s with these guys? They don't carry pen in banks, No helmet while drivingâ€¦ They don't keep change while traveling in bus. They don't have lighter when they smoke. Sir! Lighter. One second. Here. It is okay, sir... You can keep it. Donâ€™t you want it? This cigarette belongs to sin theta plus cos theta. - Hello. - Equals to tan theta. I had idea what you meant when you said that your son is busy. I have seen a different shade in him today. Ohâ€¦ - Hello, uncle. - Come in. Do you what your son does when he goes out? He will follow girls and comment them. He will dedicate the college to someone it seems. â€¦as if it belongs to him. I am unable to answer my friends and enemies. Stop it. He is not good with decision-making. He likes cricket for a period and then music. Now, it is painting. I encourage him and support with everything he wants. I hope to see him in a good position in my fantasy. But, he is nothing in reality. - What is this torture, mom? - Just for a little while. Daddy! Selfie! A selfie in this situation? Daddy! Shall we both take a selfie? Yeah, sure. - Thank you. - Okay. Not me... Try to keep her under control. She is the best in everything. She is always first. She is my daughter. Your son started taking puffs nowadays. What? Are you smoking? It wasnâ€™t me, mom. He was smoking and I was simply holding it. - Idiot. - Uncleâ€¦ - New project in my software company. - I was tensed and it was just one cigarette. Donald trump! Please. It is okay with you. You can smoke, booze or do anything you want. You have a goal in life. You got settled in software job. What is his goal? He will get settled one day, uncle. Donâ€™t worry. I am waiting for that day. Idiot. - What a family, man! - I'm leaving, uncle. - Loose some weight. - Okay. Does Roshini know that I am not into software? She doesnâ€™t know. You may leave. Okay. Hey! Donâ€™t stumble here and there like rolling stones. Settle in a right place. How many times should I tell you? - What did you say? - I told you not to ask me. Oh! Is it like telling me to not ask you? â€œI feel you in every voice that is heardâ€ â€œI hear yours when someone calls a nameâ€ â€œI see you wherever I goâ€ â€œI am indulged in love no matter what happensâ€ â€œMy heartâ€¦ Is not with me anymoreâ€ â€œI wasâ€¦ "Vanished by my heartâ€ â€œAm I there?

Why are you dull? Daddy! I had a dream. Everyone will dream. I keep getting the same dream, dad. Why do you worry about dreams? Thatâ€™s okay. What are your plans today? Nothing. Okay. Drink it. Come on... Have this. - I donâ€™t want. - Your dad is getting late for the office. I have so many meetings at office today. I have to go. - Take care and be a good girl. - Okay, daddy. - See you. - Okay. Ankitha is moody today. She thinks a lot about that dream. Shall I bring Ankitha to you? Hey! It is just a dream. Donâ€™t think too much unnecessarily. It might be her dream or a memory. You shouldnâ€™t think much about it. I will talk to Ankitha. You donâ€™t worry. - Okay. Hi. Jo? I was thinking about you. Really? Thatâ€™s why I wanted to surprise you. Why are still like this? Go and get ready. I am hungry. Let us go out and eat something. Jo! Shall I do something? Do you know how to cook? Wait here. I will be back. Five minutes. Oh no no! But, it smells good. What is this? Guess. It smells like omelet but it looks different. Ankitha cooked it. So, it will be different. Taste it and tell me... I will get ready in 2 minutes. - Shall we go out for a movie? - Movie? I am not interested. Okay. You tell me. Where shall we go? Where shall we go? Yeah! We met them. When? We met Abhi at art gallery. Why are you thinking about him now? Boys will try to travel with us if we simply look at them. If he comes to know that you asked about himâ€¦ â€¦he will want you for life. Will you be with him? Hey! Hi. We should go out for a movie and it is final. Okay? Fix it. Waitâ€¦ I will also come. It will be so good. Hey, Jo. Hi. What are you doing here? Shall we talk while we go? Look at me. Many people gaze but I never care about anyone. You should be like that. I was asking Jo about you and saw you. - About me? - Yeah. Really? Why are you getting excited? Look how he is blushing. I asked her casually. [ABHI INNER VOICE]: â€˜You think about her and she thinks about you.â€™ â€˜Hey, Abhi! You are so lucky.â€™ Youth waste their time. Silly fellows! Are you youth? You say that you are a software guy but you roam around with him. Moreover, you say that it is waste of time. I work for a client in the US. It is night for me when it is a day for us. Youâ€™ll always be with us from morning till evening. I will work in the afternoonsâ€¦ Why do you care? Donâ€™t question me for everything like CBI. What do you know about software? - I know a lot. - Do you know Java? - I had it in the morning. - Do you know Oracle? - The one beside Rama talkies. - Why wouldnâ€™t I know? - Do you know SAP? I ate last night. It was yummy. Cheap fellows! Not all these! I am working on a new program Youâ€™ll see the change within one year. You have been saying from past 10 years. Why do you talk about all of that when I ask about software? Thereâ€™s a guy like him in our village. He followed a girl very badly. She rejected him. This guy got depressed. And then he started boozing. Later, he became sick. - Whatâ€™s next? - What will happen... No one knows where he is. His dad calls me for him. - I feel uncomfortable when you say that. - How should I feel then? - Where are you? - I am at Abhiâ€™s place. Okay, hang up. I am coming. Hey! It is Ankitha! Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Satya! Art gallery? - Yeahâ€¦ Excuse me. Heâ€™s being busy these days. Hi. Which company are you working for? I am the project manager at TCS. Well said. - How can you work at TCS with Wipro ID? I work as a freelancer. Freelancer? I work as a consultant for everyone. TCS, Satyam, Wipro, Tata. Everyone! Stop it. Thatâ€™s enough. He wanted to work for a software company but he did not get a chance. - You said that you wouldnâ€™t tell anyone - Ankitha is our friend.. Okay. This secret should remain between us three. Okay? Promise? Promise. I wonâ€™t tell anyone. Hey! What is it about promise? She asked to give party and I promised to give. He wants everything. Sit down. Will you give party too? Of course! Pay back my loan first. - Jyothi! - Hey! Call me Jo. Jyothi! Come and sit. Okay, come. It is getting late. We shall go. Come and sit. - Sit. Get a large Fanta for Jyothi and a chilled one. We are getting for movie. Letâ€™s go. Movie at this time? - Letâ€™s go out for lunch. - We already decided. Is it good? What is bamboo chicken? Donâ€™t you know bamboo chicken? Havenâ€™t you had this earlier? This is my favorite food. Hey! Hi, buddy. Hey, man! Where have you been? - Hi, bro. - Hi, DJ. Ankitha! Thatâ€™s DJ. Hi. Hi. He composes nice songs. But, you might need sometime to understand. You canâ€™t say anything to me from tomorrow. - Why? I am doing a show for the first time. Don't miss it. Ankitha! You are also invited. What is DJ?

When shall we meet again? Is it okay tomorrow? Bye. [MUSIC] Bye. Letâ€™s go. - Bye. - Bye. Hey. I am telling you. She is in love with you. I saw her at the pub. Listen to me and express your feelings to her. It would be nice if I say. - But, what if she says it? - Oh! Listen to me! Such stupid plans will not work. You propose her. It would be nice to hear from her rather than telling her. I donâ€™t get it. But, she has fallen for you. Okay. Letâ€™s go... - I am telling you. No doubt. Abhi. Abhi. Go away, mom. - Get up. Do you know what time is it? - What? It's past 12 pm. It is time to have lunch and take a nap. Get up. Why didn't you go to the office? My vehicle is at servicing centerâ€¦ You should drop me. Let's go. - Why donâ€™t you take a cab? - I can go. But, I want you to drop me. Okay? He is silly. Fathers are like that. He woke me up at 12. - Hello, Mr. Varma. - Yeah, Mr. Rao. - Wait for a minute. - Dad! You are getting late to the office? - We'll go. - How are you, Mr. Rao? - Good... Are you going to the office? No! Weâ€™re going home. Your house is this way. Why are you going that way? - Is he your son? - What is he doing? He does everything but not a job. - Will you be here? - I will. I will talk to you once I come back. Mr. Varma! Heyâ€¦Stop. - What is it again, dad? - Wait. We'll go. - I have good news for you. - Tell me. - My son got admission in the US. - Really? I was following you since morning to share that. - But you were going forward. - Congratulations. Did you come to say that? - Yes. Where? Beside Trump? What happened to your friends, dad? They act like reporters. - Priest... Greetings! - Greetings, sir. - How are you doing? - I am good, sir. When is your sonâ€™s wedding? You ask him. I already have two kids. Sir! You havenâ€™t told me. I came to know just now. - You son is too fast. - Yes, he is young and fast. Morning, sir... Why are you late today? Were you stuck in the traffic? - I am stuck in my sonâ€™s life. - Sir! Is he your son? - Yeah. - He looks a movie hero. - Omkar! I plead you. He lacks that one thing. Please don't give such ideas to him. Abhi! Why didnâ€™t pick up my call? I called you many times. What should I say, Ankitha? Tell me. My dad woke me up in the morning. He tortured me starting from home till we reached his office. Hi, dad. - Jaya! Get me coffee. - Okay. Ankitha! Whoâ€™s on the phone call? It is Abhi, dad. Is it? - I forgot to tell youâ€¦ Surekha called from the States. Theyâ€™re coming to India next month. It has been so long that my sister came to India. Will you tell Trump to cancel the visa? I will say whatever if people like you listen to me. [CAMERA CLICKS] I will call you later... Okay, bye. Girl... Girlfriend? To this guy? Did you post it on FB? I am talking to you. Hey. - So, you know it. - You didnâ€™t tell me about her. Friend? More than that. Stop doing dubsmash. I am seriously asking you... - Who is that girl? - Girl? Is it a boy? Why did you become like this? Okay. Who is that girl? Go away! Look at your face! Mom! See what he is doing. Hey! Did you propose her or not? No... I impressed her. But, I have no idea how she might react if I express. One guy in my village went after one girl without proposing her. She got married when he planned to propose her. - Her husband beat him up. - You shut up. I can say that she loves me by looking into her eyes. Stop saying all that and tell us if you expressed or not. Hey! I am 99 percent sure that Ankitha is in love with me. But, I have one percent doubt. - That one percent is enough. - Everyone will fail at that point. I donâ€™t want to face that. That is why I want her to express her feelings first. A girl never proposes a boy. Boys will propose to girls. Boys are great... Girls are waste. Few feelings make us happy. We get a feeling to see the girl. We wait. We plan to meet. We fail to express. All these feelings are blissful. Weâ€™d miss all these of we express our love on the first day. My love story should be cool, interesting and beautiful. You think that she has fallen for you. You think that she talks only with you. Expecting her to hop on your bike. Expecting her in your dreams. At the end, she might love someone else. These are all common. Just chill. Hey! Wonâ€™t you ever talk in a positive manner? - Girls areâ€¦ - Stop it. That girl is waiting for me to express. I am waiting for her to express. That feeling is awesome. I understand because I am experiencing it. Guys like you wonâ€™t understand. Waste fellows. After traveling with you for 6 months, She would say that you are just a friend and sheâ€™ll leave. There is no use to feel bad then. That is why you should have some clarity before itself. Donâ€™t get into such things. You cannot get out of it later. Nothing of that will happen to you. You are good looking with nose and all. It's okay. That reminds of something. There is guy named Raju in my village. - His nose is charming. Heâ€¦ - Shut up. You have someone to compare with in every situation. Let's go! Look at that face! â€˜Friends are always like this.â€™ â€˜They raised many doubts in my mind.â€™ â€˜What should I do now?â€™ Sister. Oh! He calls me in a sweet manner. He needs my help. I am in my class. - Hello. - Roshini. Tell me fast. Sir will come. Nothing. I have to speak with you. I have exams. It is not possible. â€˜She understood.â€™ I thought of taking you to ice cream store. Is it not possible for you? Ice cream? You always disturb me while I study. I know very well about your studies. You are pleasing me, right? Okay. I will think about it. - Are you coming? - Yeah. I will come. Okay. â€˜She is simply overacting. I know her.â€™ It feels happy to eat with his money. Should I ask you now or should I ask you after you eat? Ask me after I eat... I know about you. You will leave without paying the bill. â€˜Sheâ€™s tricking me.â€™ How will these girls be? Go and get your eyes checked. I am right here and you ask me how girls are. They will be like me. Hey! You and your stupid face! - I will leave. - Heyâ€¦sorryâ€¦ - Thatâ€™s how you should behave. - Actuallyâ€¦ What are the inner feelings of girls? Letâ€™s do open talk. Okay. Will girls propose or not? If it is about meâ€¦ About you? Who is that? Is that the guy who drives bike in a good manner or someone else? Tell him that I will not spare him. No love stories for you during first year. Whatâ€™s your age and what kind of things you do? â€˜Is it too much?â€™ Helloâ€¦ I am not that type. No one dares doing it. I have clarity about my life. You stop over acting. It is not wrong to fall in love. But, age matters for everything. You shouldnâ€™t love at your age. You are still young. I can love at my age. I know. Is your doubt about you or about me? - I will leave if you behave like this. - Heyâ€¦ If not, I will have another ice cream. How many ice creams will you have? Tell me any of your friendsâ€™ love stories. My friends are not grown-ups like you. You talk about age, right? Will you tell or not? Please. - Hey. Will anyone ask his sister about love? Hey! It is not about love. How does girls think? I want to know that. No girl will express her feelings. She hides her feelings. You should express first. Then, we can see what happens. Shall we meet tomorrow? I have to talk to you. Thatâ€™s too much. Let yourself down. Is it? You said that girls do not express and hide their feelings. Pay the bill for your ice cream and post it on FB. You will get more likes. Byeâ€¦ Girls do not pay the bill. Abhi! Iâ€™ve been waiting to say something to you. Abhi! I want to say I love you. I love you, Abhi. I was thinking of a way to express my feelings. I loved you in my first sight, Ankitha. I love you too. â€˜What is this? I was dreaming?â€™ My dress is right. But, Ankithaâ€™s dress does not match. I will not fail for sure. Dress isnâ€™t a matter... Heart is important. Hi. Hi, Ankitha. Hi. I should ask you something. Can I? â€˜Is it real?â€™ Donâ€™t waste time and ask me. I want to ask you but I am not sure how you might react. Why will I react? I feel whatever you feel. Okay, I will ask you. Iâ€¦ You? - Can you teach me painting? - What? Painting? Painting is nothing. I will teach. Do you like painting? I donâ€™t just like it. It is a necessity. Okay. That's fine. Next? Whatâ€™s next? I donâ€™t have any plans to exhibit my paintings. You impressed me. I should teach you painting. Is that all? I will teach you. Not that, Ankitha. What is that you want to tell me? There should be clarity is few things. I say yes to whatever you say. I am scared that you might say No if I say something. What is this â€˜Yesâ€™ and â€˜Noâ€™? I donâ€™t understand anything. What are those flowers and love symbols in messages? I send them to make the message colorful. Did you call me to say that? - Yes. Isnâ€™t there anything else? There is nothing else. You could have said that on phone. Phone. Soâ€¦ Did you call me here to ask about painting? Are you sure? - Sure. - Is it painting? I will teach you. Bye. Bye. You are right, guys. Girls will not express their love. What happened? Tell me what happened. I expected something. But, something else happened. I knew it. I know about you and your expectations. What is your opinion about girls? Are you expecting them to propose just because they are close to you? Are you saying that Ankitha doesnâ€™t have feelings for me? But, I feel that she loves me. Ankitha is very different from others. She is very innocent.... She is not like other girls. Why will such a unique person come and propose you? What should I do now? Give me back the ice cream I paid. Hey! I will give you. This is too much. This is nothing before what you did. Will you give or not? You should pay the interest too. - Give me your wallet. - You want money, right? I will buy you an ice cream and then give you. Give me a good suggestion. I am already in confusion. Then, you should go and propose her. I am tensed about her response if I propose. My intention is that it might be good if she proposes me. I have to do something and end this. How many times should I tell you? Girls will not propose first. You have to propose. You do it first. - I have to do it first? - Hmm. Ankitha! Do you know how to cook? I can cook omelet. â€“ Omelet? Do you like it? Cooking is not a problem. My mom will take care of it. â€˜Donâ€™t look at me like that. I cannot control myself.â€™ Abhi! Whatâ€™s that surprise you were talking about? - Nothing. â€˜Abhi! You brought Ankitha here to propose.â€™ â€˜You forget that and simply say nothing.â€™ â€˜Is it needed? First tell her.â€™ What is it, Abhi? Why are you talking to yourself? That isâ€¦ Your hair is nice. Which shampoo? Hair? Thatâ€™s not the matterâ€¦ You were trying to say something else. Somethingâ€¦right? Sky is nice, right? - It's so nice. - â€˜Are you weather reporter to say that?â€™ Why do you care about those? This is your first love. You are trying to express your love for the first time. You wonâ€™t get a better chance. Tell her. Come on... 1...2â€¦3â€¦4 Ankitha. What is it, Abhi? Your eyes are amazing. Eyes? â€˜Her eyes are disturbing.â€™ - Abhi. What happened to you? Your behavior is different. â€˜Not different but worst behavior.â€™ â€˜You know what I want to tell you.â€™ â€˜You must have decided.â€™ â€˜That I should express it.â€™ - I will find moment to say it. - Hey! Is it dance movement? You can hear such things. Your dance was so good at the pub that day. Can you teach me? Please. - Please. No. - Pleaseâ€¦ Leave it.... Some other timeâ€¦ Please tell me that you will teach. Ankitha! This is my favorite place. I love this place. Do you like it? It is beautiful. Amazing. Will you teach me to dance or not? Gosh! Youâ€™ll not leave me until I teach. - Turn around... Hey. â€œOh! Oâ€™ my girlâ€ â€œWho are you, Oâ€™ angel?â€ â€œThis disturbance in meâ€ â€œIs all because of youâ€ â€œYou are all mineâ€ â€œI am all yoursâ€ â€œYou are filled in meâ€ â€œThis love enthused my heartâ€ â€œThis love walks towards youâ€ â€œOh! Oâ€™ my girlâ€ â€œWho are you, Oâ€™ angel?â€ â€œThis disturbance in meâ€ â€œIs all because of youâ€ â€œShall I write letters that take me to you?â€ â€œShall I make sketches in the air that explains you?â€ â€œShall I rename this type of language?â€ â€œThat treasures you in my breathâ€ â€œShall I come to you once a day?â€ â€œThat ensures a lifelong attachmentâ€ â€œYour voice pulls me this sideâ€ â€œYou are the beat of my heartâ€ â€œOh! Oâ€™ my girlâ€ â€œWho are you, Oâ€™ angel?â€ â€œThis disturbance in meâ€ â€œIs all because of youâ€ â€œLike a part of my bodyâ€ â€œYou are everywhereâ€ â€œThere is no much distanceâ€ â€œYou dwell in my heartâ€ â€œThis is something that canâ€™t be expressed in wordsâ€ â€œMoments of dismay turn out to be ecstaticâ€ â€œItâ€™s a potent gaze beyond yoursâ€ â€œIn between the left and the rightâ€ â€œThere is this twirling storyâ€ â€œLike a dream of twoâ€ â€œAdjoins as one like usâ€ â€œOh! Oâ€™ my girlâ€ â€œWho are you, Oâ€™ angel?â€ â€œThis disturbance in meâ€ â€œIs all because of youâ€ Abhi! I am so happy being with you. You are so handsome. Did anyone propose to you? Donâ€™t you have any love story? I donâ€™t have any love story till now. [LOWER TONE]: There will be a story if you accept my love. What is your opinion about love, Abhi? Love isnâ€™t past or present for me. It's my future. Suppose if we love someone, No matter what the situation is... we should never give up our love. We should never forget that or let others forget. It's my feeling... That's my opinion. I have a same feeling. Is it? [ABHI INNER VOICE]: â€˜You wonâ€™t get a better chance than this, Abhi.â€™ Ankitha. â€˜I tried hard to get some courage.â€™ â€˜Where did she go?â€™ Sorryâ€¦ What were you saying? â€˜What can I say now?â€™ - Abhi! I have to tell you something. I love my dad so much. Not just love, he is my life. I share everything with my dad. Now, I did not share this with my dad but I am telling you first. You are so close to me... Closer to my heart! â€˜She says everything but not the important thing.â€™ What is that you want to tell me? I am waiting for a guy who is in my dreams. - Dream? - Yes, Abhi. I am in love with him. He is my love, life. He is my life. I will wait lifelong for him. He is my first and last love. I have a hope that he will meet me some day. It might sound silly but I want to see how he looks now. Am I boring you with my love story? You might have been bored. I can talk my heart out when you are beside me. Hey! Why are you standing here? Are you enjoying the view? Abhi. Abhi. Listen to me. Wait. Abhi. Hey. You know what I want to say. But, you talk something without letting me say it. What do you want to say? Okay. Let me tell you. What is it, Abhi? Ankithaâ€¦ I thought that she is not expressive. But, she didnâ€™t let me express. Are you still thinking about her? I knew it from the day you started thinking seriously about her... â€¦that weâ€™d have this discussion at beach. You didnâ€™t listen to me. This is his first love. It's obviously painful. Leave him alone for some time. Is there anyone in this world who isnâ€™t a love failure? There is failure behind every successful love story. We should get depressed about it. We should try to come out of it. Listen to me and come out of it, bro. Hey! It is so hard to understand these girls. They confuse us a lot. I like you so much... I want this lifelong. Time just passes by when I am with you. They ask us not to miss them in life. We imagine a life and have dreams with them. She says that she loves a guy in her dreams. The funny thing is that she didnâ€™t even see him till now. Who says that? It is easy to find the depth of this ocean. But, we can never deeply understand a girl. - There is a lot of confusion. - All girls are like that, bro. They get close to us at the beginning. We imagine a life with them and have expectations. We dream about them having a colorful life. But, they will find someone else. Our life remains black and white. Iâ€™ve seen a lot like this in my village. Hey. He is already frustratedâ€¦ If you keep talking about your villageâ€¦ Iâ€™ll break a bottle on your head. Hey, bro. This is the fact. Girls might take some time to say I love you. They never have second thoughts about breaking up. You are right. It's okay if she rejects after you propose her. But, she indirectly said No without even proposing. What should we call it? It is fate... Fate! We endured Tsunami, hudhud and even denomination. How can we bear a broken heart? I told you earlier. Things like that in love are common. You have to be practical and move forward. It will turn out like this if you wait for her to express and do something. But, she is not like every other girl. She is very good and she likes me a lot. But, I do not understand why she does like that. I have a feeling that she talks like that to make fun of me. You still have a positive feeling about her. I donâ€™t understand if it is your innocence or foolishness. We should care about love and all. We should wake up, go outside and perform errands and have fun in the evening. Have few drinks. Everything will be all right. Drink it. Alcohol cannot calm me. Hey! Like in old movie â€˜Devadasâ€™ and in latest movie â€˜Arjun Reddyâ€™â€¦. Alcohol heals lovers. There wonâ€™t alcohol and that girl in my life from today. Thatâ€™s it. So, this is what I say about girls. â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€ â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€ â€œMy pulse rate is far beyond normalâ€ â€œMy body weight falls graduallyâ€ â€œWith the charm in her eyesâ€ â€œShe locked me upâ€ â€œWith her lovable talks, She walks away from meâ€ â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€ â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€ â€œIt is Lord Brahmaâ€™s faultâ€ â€œFor giving her such beautyâ€ â€œPeople are gentle on outsideâ€ â€œNo words can describe the intensityâ€ â€œNever fall in love, my friendâ€ â€œHave a drink and walk your pet to be goodâ€ â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€ â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€ â€œTheyâ€™re never clear with what they sayâ€ â€œTheir words keep changingâ€ â€œThey welcome us into their lifeâ€ â€œOur life becomes a nightmareâ€ â€œThey make us crazy with their tricksâ€ â€œThey say weâ€™re just friends when we propose.â€ â€œOhâ€¦Oâ€™ my Godâ€ â€œMy heart beats for the beautyâ€ Why are you like that, Abhi? Why donâ€™t you say something? Serve some chutney. He never says anything properly. Tell me now. Okay... Tell dad that Iâ€™ll go to office from today. Is that the reason for your expression? Why? Wonâ€™t you tell him? No, dear. You can tell him directly. You tell his words to me. Wonâ€™t you tell him mine? Okayâ€¦I will tell him. - Have green tea. - Thank you. Did you add sugar? You went for jogging to reduce your sugar levels. Is it needed? Donâ€™t get shocked but there is good news for you. Abhi decided to come to the office. What is this sudden change? - He should know that. - I suspect this. Why are you discussing when I said that Iâ€™d come to office? You ask me to come when I donâ€™t want to and you are questioning me now. - Are you coming to office or not? - I will not come. - I am going. - Abhi. Today is Sunday. I will go anyway. Your son goes to office on Sundays. Hi. What happened? Tell me what happened. Abhi is avoiding me. I donâ€™t know what happened. He doesn't answer my calls. He goes away when we see each other. Why? I donâ€™t know. I already told you that guys are dangerous. Even they donâ€™t know how they behave. Okay. Leave it. I want to talk to Abhi. Okayâ€¦ Donâ€™t get emotional. I will call Satya. See! Son-in-law is awesome. You achieved your goal, son-in-law. You are great. I knew about his talent earlier. Thatâ€™s your affection, uncle. My father dreamed about me getting into software field. Did your father wanted you to get into software back in those days? You fulfilled my fatherâ€™s dream. He will die if he finds the truth. Uncle! I have a doubt. Were there computers back in those days? Yes. There were large systems. Now theyâ€™re all tiny. He must have read about computers in newspapers. Otherwise, how will he have such knowledge? It has been ringing for so long. Pick it up. It is from the office. I already told them that Iâ€™ve got an alliance today. I asked them not to disturb me. They don't listen... They canâ€™t work without me. Put a lemon in pockets to stay away from evil. - Iâ€™ve got a pumpkin too. - No. Both of your sizes are same. Uncle is being sarcastic. Call him. Why are they calling me so many times? Please... I have an alliance. - Shut up and come. - Not possible... Letâ€™s meet later. Will you come or should I tell them about your job? Oh my! No. My son-in-law knows all languages. I learned all as Iâ€™m into software. - Oh. - Oh. By the way, who are they? They are my colleagues from office. The clients came from the US it seems. They want to meet me. I will be back. - Why did you come? - Why did you disconnect my call? I have an alliance. Canâ€™t you see? - Shut up and come. - Come out. What is it? Why is he avoiding Ankitha? Is it? I donâ€™t know what she did to him. I didn't do anything, Satya. Abhi was playing with coke tin and I kicked it. He got angry for that. - Really? Did he get angry for this small issue? Heâ€™s getting angry for every small thing. He gets angry for everything. He doesnâ€™t pick my calls either. - Stop this nonsense. - This fatso is here. I am screwed now. Tell him to pick up the call. Otherwise, I'll tell them about you. - Son-in-law! - Yeah... Heâ€™s annoying me. Hey! Jyothi and Ankitha came to my house yesterday. Why did they come? They want to speak with you. Hey! Leave it... I donâ€™t want to talk. She doesnâ€™t understand my value because I am after her. She has something in mind by saying something else. I cannot sustain her acting. Hey! Poor thing! Talk to her once. She came this far. Leave it. - Tell him. - Why donâ€™t you talk to her once? What are you thinking? What is the matter? I am unable to forget Ankitha. I say that I want to forget her but my heart doesnâ€™t want to. She knew that Iâ€™d express my love to her. So, she said about her love in dreams. I havenâ€™t loved anyone till now. Why did I love her? Why am I thinking about her so much? I thought that Ankitha loved me as much as I loved her. Hey! I didnâ€™t expect you to be serious about love. Iâ€™m touched when I see your emotion. Not just me... Even my friends are feeling bad. Not just my friends... Everyone is feeling bad. What? Only you, my friends and me knew this, right? Your feeling is good. So, I started a live video on Facebook. Oh no!.. This is bad... I am feeling sad and you post it on Facebook. Hey. See this. So many likes and comments. Hey! Donâ€™t you worry about me? You make it public. You are enjoying comments, right? Nice! I came to share my feelings with you. But, you post it on Facebook. All right! Everyone is worried everyone is selfish about being happy. Life is full of likes and dislikes. He will never understand me. Is this an AD film? For you to follow me and I follow you. Why are you talking like that, Abhi? Donâ€™t you know why? Is it why I spoke something that day which was boring? Is it why because I kicked the coke tin another day? How can you be so innocent? Please donâ€™t say that, Abhi. Why are you like that? - Tell me, Abhi... Please. - Hey. I am feeling bad. Why are you avoiding me? Donâ€™t you know what I feel? I am so happy when I am with you. I can share anything with you... You are close to my heart. I cannot stay without talking to you or see you. You say everything but act as if thereâ€™s nothing. I donâ€™t understand what your problem is. You know everything. You know what I feel. You know what I want to say. Why do you behave like this? I really donâ€™t know. Is it? Leave it. Stop calling me and donâ€™t come after me. There is nothing between us. Forget me. Please. Abhi. - What happened? - Sheâ€™s like this after coming home. - What happened, dear? - Ankitha. Look at daddy... What happened, dear? - Look at me. - What happened? Did someone misbehave with you? Let her take rest for 5 minutes... Sheâ€™ll become normal. I will be right backâ€¦ Donâ€™t worry. Hi. Sit. Uncle! Why did you call me? I donâ€™t know what happened between you and Ankitha. Ankitha is very upset. I should tell something about her. This wasnâ€™t shared with anyone except our family. But, I am telling you becauseâ€¦ â€¦Ankitha is happy with just the way sheâ€™s happy with us. I have observed that many times. There is a risk to her life if there is any negative reaction from your side. We went to Annavaram on Ankithaâ€™s 13th birthday. - Hey. - Yayâ€¦ Reduce the volume. Please. Stop. You should not do that when weâ€™re on highway. See thereâ€¦ Wow. That is why I told you. Put on your seat belt. [HONKING] Put on the seat beltâ€¦ I will do it, dad. [GLASS BREAK] [BLEEPS] How long will it take for her to recover? Prasad... It's hard to say when she will get out of coma. Ankitha will be safe, right? - She is safe. She will recover soon. Ankitha! â€œHappy birthday to youâ€ See... I bought your favorite teddy bear for you. You wanted a bicycle, right? We bought that tooâ€¦ Not just thatâ€¦ We bought a big LED TV. You can watch your favorite cartoon channel. Mom made your favorite Gulab Jamun sweet. Your aunt whoâ€™s your favorite is coming from America. Let us all go to the States. After you come home. Okay? Ankitha is responding to the treatment. I am sure that she will get well soon. How long will you be like this keeping everything aside? You are an engineer. How long will you be like this without caring about your future? We will take care of her. Nothing is more important than my daughter. Ankitha is my life. It gives utmost joy to see our kids grow. But, to watch them grow on a hospital bed is scary. That sorrow is inexpressible. Ankitha is out of coma after 7 years. My life is back after seeing her. Doctor said that Ankitha has recovered completely. But, there was some disturbance in my heart. Dad! Where am I? Ankitha was angry and silent ever since we came to this house. She couldnâ€™t recognize anyone except her mother and me. She spent most of her time alone. She had major head injury on left side in the accident. Her nervous system got damaged and she lost her memory. She can recognize her parents, but she forgot her past. Because her brain can only think to some extent. She might be matured at times and childish otherwise. She wonâ€™t have strength to control herself. She cannot think too much or feel bad. She might go back to coma if she does that. Itâ€™s okay for her to rememberâ€¦ But if we stress her about pastâ€¦ Her brain might get stressed which is a risk to her life. You should always keep her happy. You should encourage her in everything and be supportive. That will be very helpful for her. It took time for her to recover. After meeting you, Ankitha was very happy and active more than ever before. Please do not hurt her. I will console if thereâ€™s any mistake from her side. But, if something happens to herâ€¦ I cannot take it. Sorry, uncle... I am really sorry. I will not trouble Ankitha... I will be normal with her like I was before. Thank you. [PHONE RINGING] â€œSomethingâ€¦there is something that happened to meâ€ â€œEverything seems enchanted when youâ€™re not aroundâ€ â€œLike thisâ€¦I see you whole-heartedlyâ€ â€œI have treasured you in my world of fantasyâ€ â€œThereâ€™s disturbance in meâ€ â€œThoughts in my heart are about youâ€ â€œThere is no one like you and meâ€ â€œYou and I are not distinctâ€ â€œThe true meaning of beauty is your smileâ€ â€œIâ€™m lost like mist when I see that smileâ€ â€œYour eyes speak somethingâ€ â€œWhatever it is, I simply need thatâ€ â€œThereâ€™s disturbance in meâ€ â€œThoughts in my heart are about youâ€ â€œThere is no one like you and meâ€ â€œYou and I are not distinctâ€ Daddy! I have a surprise for you. 1â€¦2â€¦3â€¦ andâ€¦ What is this? Wow! Wonderful. â€“ Wow. Oh! Super! This is my first painting. How is it, daddy? It is fantastic, dear. Itâ€™s an awesome painting. It is very nice. How is it, Srinu? It's a bit confusing. Did Jyothi teach you painting? - Hey! Call me Jo. - Oh! Sir! Should I get it framed? Hey! You should do it after it gets finished. It is already finished, daddy. Is it finished? Wow! Fantastic, baby. I havenâ€™t seen such painting ever in my life. This is true, sir. This is the first and will be the last painting I see, sir. Heyâ€¦ What do you know about artists? â€œMay be this is our destinyâ€ â€œLook at this if you heart wants toâ€ â€œA day without you isnâ€™t neededâ€ â€œStay with me now and foreverâ€ â€œThereâ€™s disturbance in meâ€ â€œThoughts in my heart are about youâ€ â€œThere is no one like you and meâ€ â€œYou and I are not distinctâ€ Hey, Ankitha. Didnâ€™t you forget me? Didnâ€™t you recognize me, Ankitha? You are looking so beautiful. Ankitha! Are you doing well? - It has been many days I saw you. - Why are you staring at them? - Thatâ€™s your aunt and uncle. - Sit. - Hi, Ankitha. How are you? - Hello, uncle. She was naughty in childhood. Now, she is very innocent. She is not innocent. She is the same... My daughter-in-law is an angel. - Uncleâ€¦ - Kiran. Are you doing well? I am good, uncle. Brother... How are you? It has been many years weâ€™ve seen each other. Are you doing well? - Hello. Why are you staring like that? Do you know who that is? He is your brother-in-law. Brother-in-law? See how she is blushing. Girls like idiots only. They wonâ€™t change even after generation changes. They always choose idiots. Dude! I came first in the Idiotic competition back in my village. We already know it. Will you give me your phone number? Who? Letâ€™s leave. We might become idiots like him if we stay with him. Okay. Letâ€™s go. Ankitha! Hi, Ankitha. Abhi! I have a surprise for you. What is that surprise? Shall we meet? Iâ€™m shocked with your surprises. Just tell meâ€¦ - Guess it... - Donâ€™t test me now. Tell me directly. I will say when we meet. - You will really get shocked. - We shall meet at the restaurant. Come fast... Okay, bye. Ankitha. Abhi! This is Kiran. Kiran! He is Abhi. - Hi, bro. - Hi. Who is this new character? Guess who he is. - Is he your brother? - No. He is my cousin. - He is your brother. - No. He is father-in-lawâ€™s son. But, he is still brother. - Something happened to him. - Yes, bro! But, I am your brother. My dream boy is none other than Kiran. I recognized you because of Abhi. You taught me painting and helped me to find Kiran. Thanks, bro. I would not know what Ankitha feels if it wasnâ€™t that painting. So, I taught you painting... and you screwed me. Get upâ€¦ Iâ€™m talking to you. - Get up! - Hey, Abhi. Who are you? I am the one who loves her. She asked me to teach painting and I taught her. She drew something and you appeared. Abhi! What happened? If you come when she paints, What should I do? Hey! I love her. I will spend all life looking at her. Hey! She introduced you as her dream boy. Should I give my blessing for your weddingâ€¦? And remain like a loser to mind my own business? Abhi. Abhi! Hey, bro... Why donâ€™t you say something? What happened? Were you dreaming? Dream? You would understand if it was real. Ankitha! I have work. I will meet you later. Okay. [PHONE RINGING] One second. Hello... Yeah. Whatâ€™s with that dream and that painting? I donâ€™t understand anything. You like Abhi, right? Abhi is my best friend. I like Abhi so much. Who is this Kiran? I waited all this while for Kiran. Did you wait for Kiran? What is it? What are you saying? Arenâ€™t you in love with Abhi? Love? Me? What do you mean? One thing is true, Ankitha. Abhi loves you more than his life. All of us know that except you. Abhi is the right choice for you. What are you saying? You are confusing me. Kiran! How do I know you? Ankitha! Why are you asking like that? Abhi! Sorry. Kiran. Didnâ€™t you remember me at least once? I did not forget you for me to remember. You are always here. Finally, Satya is getting engaged with his uncleâ€™s daughter. I am still in shocked with Ankithaâ€™s surprise. I didn't meet Ankitha from that day. I am waiting for Ankitha to come. Ankitha came. But, sheâ€™s with Kiran. She looked very casual. I tried to be casual and talked something. I had no idea what I was talking. Sorry for the late. - Hi. - Hi. Sudha! This fatso was with us all this while. He acts weird when a girl enters his life. Yeah! He quit drinking with us too. His situation will change when they find out about him. What is it about him? Donâ€™t you know? There should be someone like him in your village, right? The one who knows nothing but says he knows everything. There is no one like that. Think again. There must be someone. Who is that? Suri? Srinu? Is that me by chance? You know everything. Everything happens in your village... Everyone is there in your village. Your villagers are great. One minute. Donâ€™t think too much about them. Can you sit there if you donâ€™t mind? - Yeah, okay. That reminds me of something. Let me tell you this. Please stop it... Enough. We are all talking... But, why is Kiran silent? He is saying something interesting. - Okay, I will say. There is a tamarind tree in my village. There is a tea stall near that. A guy under that tree listens to anything just like you. He doesnâ€™t have any work. He waits for people to tell gossips. Is that me? Almost same. Bro! Thereâ€™s another thing. It is about a lady. There is one guy who wears black shirt. - What happened isâ€¦ - Brother! Not now. Some other time. - No, listen now. - Next time. I will listen to it next time. Itâ€™s already lateâ€¦ Ankitha! Shall we move? Bye, Abhi. Bye, guys. - Shall I tell again? - Noâ€¦ Byeâ€¦ Ankitha! Why are you dull? I am feeling bad for leaving Abhi behind. Abhi is the reason we are together. Abhi is always special for us. Such a nice guy! Abhiâ€™s family and friends are so close to me. I like his mother, father and sister. Oh! Is it? We should meet them, then. Abhi is a good guy, right? He is very nice person. Time just passes by when I am with Abhi. You talk a lot about Abhi. You completely forgot about me sitting next to you. No. I am talking a lot about Abhi. This is all because of Abhi. Sorry, Kiran. Sorry. It's okay. Ankitha! I love you. - Comeâ€¦ - What is it? - Have a seat. - What's that serious discussion? It is about them. We spoke about Kiranâ€™s wedding. But, he needs 2 -3 yearâ€™s time. We should talk to Ankitha like weâ€™ve decided earlier. We should know her opinion, brother. I like Ankitha very much. I will marry her now if you ask me to. Actually, Ankitha is not aware about this. Ankitha! We are planning to get you married with Kiran. It will happen if you like. I have a project in one month, uncle. We can both go to the States if the wedding happens before that. We are okay with it if Ankitha agrees. Dear... Why are you dull? Are you scared about the wedding? Why should I get married so early, daddy? Tell me only if you like it. Okay? How can I leave you all and go to the States? Hey, come on. You donâ€™t have to worry about going to the States. We call talk on Skype everyday. I will come to the States. Ankitha! It's my responsibility as a father to get my daughter married to a nice guy. I will be very happy if its your auntâ€™s family. They will treat you like their own daughter. Kiran likes you a lot. I think you wonâ€™t miss anything there. Everything is going to be fine. So, donâ€™t worry about anything. Just cheer up and be happy. Okay? [PHONE RINGING] - Hello. - Hello. Tell me. What is it? - I have to talk to you... - I am in a meeting with client. Can we talk later? I have to talk now. - Come home. - Okay. I will come. Okay. Come fast... Bye. Okay, bye. Why are you dull? Abhi! My marriage is fixed. They said that marriage will be in two or three days. Abhi! Why donâ€™t you say something? Wedding suddenly? Are you not feeling sad? Why will I feel bad when you get married, Ankitha? Then, why are you so dull? You see that I am sad but canâ€™t understand my love. I am feeling very sad. You are just feeling sad, Ankitha. But, your wedding sounds breathless to me. We wonâ€™t meet after the wedding. Obviously, that is what happens after wedding. Rather than being happy about the wedding... I am sad for leaving you I cannot be with you lifelong, Ankitha. No one can travel with someone for a long time. It doesnâ€™t happen unless there is love. Abhi. [PHONE RINGING] Dad! No... Please. Come, dear. Just come. Iâ€™ll tell you. Good morning, sir. Yes. New admission? - Yes, sir. - What is his name? Abhiram! - Are you joining? - No. Thatâ€™s not me. He is my son. [LAUGHTER] Silence! My son is a little shy. He will get used to it once he joins them. You are not in first grade. You are in eighth grade. - Go and sit. - Goâ€¦ - Please, dad. - You shouldnâ€™t get scared. They are all your friends. See... They are laughing. Hey. [DISTANT CHATTER] Hey, get lost. Come home... I will tell uncle. - Go away. Letâ€™s go. Who is that? He is my auntâ€™s son Kiran. [DISTANT CHATTER] [LAUGHTER] What are you doing with that fatso? - What did you say? - Fatso! - No. What did you say after that? - You are crossing your limits. This is what I call extreme. I will tell your parents... Youâ€™ll get punished. Come, Laddu. Let us go. I get scared when Kiran looks at me angrily. Will you do something I say? Slap him if Kiran says something to you. - Wonâ€™t he say anything? - He will say if you don't hit him. - Heyâ€¦ Fatso is here. - He might beat me. We should laugh now. Whatâ€™s that expression? I will bash you up if I see you with Ankitha ever again. Hey! What are you thinking? - Sorry, brother. - What sorry? Sorryâ€¦ That should be to the left. Ankithaâ€™s is right and mine is left. - Which one is good, brother? - Both are not good. Thank you, brother. Bye. He was innocent in the beginning. Did you really hit him? Will you do anything I say? - Then, I will say something. - You should say yes for that. Yes. Not now. Later. What is that anyway? I will tell you. [DISTANT CHATTER] Come closer. Remove your bags. Smile. [CAMERA CLICKS] Thank you. Uncle! Give me one photo. Sure. I will send it with Abhi. Bujji! What, Laddu? Here. My dad gave me photos for you and Kiran. What about you? - I have one. - Come, Laddu. Letâ€™s go. Letâ€™s go. Tell your dad that these photos are good. - Yeah. Okay. We had school holidays after that. I didnâ€™t see her again. She forgot her past due to that accident. But, Ankitha loves me then and now. Why donâ€™t you tell that to her? That is the problem. I know her condition. Something might happen to her if I say. Hey! Will you tell her or not? We will make it understandable. Nothing will change, no matter who says it. The problem has a solution but I can do nothing. I donâ€™t know what to do. I will do anything for her. I will wait for her any longer. But, I can bear the fact that he cheated her to get married. Hey, Abhi. What brings you here? Heâ€™s Abhi. Ankithaâ€™s close friend. - Hi, Abhi. He is the reason for my happiness today. Yes. I am definitely the reason for Kiranâ€™s happiness. Hey, Abhi! Do you smoke? - What else? - Why did you lie? Lie? And Me? Stop acting. Hey! Be clear with what you speak. I donâ€™t understand what you are talking about. You wonâ€™t become me if you tell her that it is you in the photo. - You are? - Exactly. You are making a big mistake. Ankitha is my life. Ankitha loves me. Arenâ€™t you ashamed to get close to her by cheating? I loved Ankitha even before you love her. I love her since childhood. She likes you when we were kids. She loves you even now. Am I a joker between you too? I came happily for her from the US. I saw her holding your photo. Thatâ€™s when I understood that she still loves you. Damn it! I felt like killing you. Does she know you or not? Did she meet you or not? Where you are and how you are! I simply came to one decision. I made her believe that itâ€™s me in the photo. She believed me. This is not right. Ankitha is mine. She is my uncleâ€™s daughter. She is my right. Will you tell her what all happened? Go and say it. Even then, Ankitha will be mine. I will not leave her. I am holding myself because something might happen to her. Ankitha will come to me when she finds out that itâ€™s me in the photo. What will you do then? Hey. Get lost. I am worried how she reacts after knowing the truth. But, if I do not tell her the truthâ€¦ â€¦I can never tell her. Listen to what I say. Actually Kiran isâ€¦ What is it, Abhi? Wonâ€™t you think about Ankitha? How can you leave us and go? How can we let you go? Ankitha can live without me. But, she cannot live without you. I mean as a friend. Am I right, Ankitha? Abhi. Why are you like that? Nothing, dad. I know. I know everything about your love. Ankitha is getting married. Do you know that? I know that she loves me but she doesnâ€™t recognize me due to her condition. I know that she loves me but I am unable to her in this situation. She might forget me but not what is in her heart, dad. There will be supplementary if we fail in exams. But, love failure doesnâ€™t get a second chance. I am sure that your love is strong. When does it happen, dad? Is it after she gets married to Kiran? A cigarette or alcohol can cure this. But, what should I have for this? I want Ankitha, dad. I tried to tell her many times about my love. But, I couldnâ€™t say. I cannot live without her. I want Ankitha. â€œDeep in my heart, thereâ€™s a woundâ€ â€œSomething that canâ€™t be expressed is this loveâ€ â€œYouâ€™ve become my lifeâ€ â€œEven if this journey is indefiniteâ€ â€œMy silence is never heardâ€ â€œNo one breaks that silenceâ€ â€œI am with you while I think of youâ€ â€œI am not with me while I think of youâ€ â€œYou are in me while I think of youâ€ â€œIâ€™m left alone while I think of youâ€ â€œDeep in my heart, thereâ€™s a woundâ€ â€œSomething that canâ€™t be expressed is this loveâ€ â€œI think of youâ€¦" [HUMMING] â€œI think of youâ€¦" [HUMMING] â€œYou are in me while I think of youâ€ â€œIâ€™m left alone while I think of youâ€ Love doesnâ€™t happen when we think of it or plan for it. Love happens only once. Love will remain even if we lose our life. Ineffable love! Intolerable sorrow! I hold it in my heart. One second, one hour, one dayâ€¦ One yearâ€¦ Let it be any longer. I will think about her as long as I live. With her memories and for her loveâ€¦ This waitingâ€¦it canâ€™t be expressed in words. After knowing that you my dream boy, my love should increase. But, I donâ€™t have that feeling for you. Did I really love you, Kiran? I loved you in my dream. I am unable to love you like that when you are here. I havenâ€™t felt that love I expected from you. I donâ€™t feel it in me either. You are the one in my dream. But, my heart is confused. Why? Why am I not able to love you as I loved in my dream? If I donâ€™t tell you that I love Abhi, I should suffer lifelong for doing this mistake. I can't marry you. I am sorry. Dad! Am I doing wrong? You gave it a thought and decided what you want. I am so happy to see my daughter like this. My daughter says everything to me like a kid. She told me what she wants for the first time. Any father feels bad when his daughter denies to get married at the wedding atrium. But, I am feeling very happy. Keeping aside the denial of this wedding, As a father, my daughter is important to me. Not only me. His daughter is important to any father. Her happiness is important. My daughter clarified that she loves Abhi and that she live happily with Abhi. I respect my daughterâ€™s decision. My daughter is never wrong. You are never wrong, dear. You will not. Abhi! Abhi. Ankitha! What are doing here? Do you know Abhi? I am lost in your thoughts always. It is true, Abhi. I cannot live without you, Abhi. It makes me sad knowing that I will miss you. I am so happy when I am with you. I want to be with like this forever. It is true, Abhi. I thought that the one I loved is in my dream. But, the one I love is in my heart. He is standing in front of me. Thatâ€™s you! Abhi! Havenâ€™t you felt that love for me at least once? Not just once. I felt that every time my heart beats from the day I saw you. I loved you at first sight. You are the love of my life, Ankitha. I tried to express my love every time I meet you. But, I couldnâ€™t say it. Now, I am telling you. I love you. I love you forever and ever. I love you, Ankitha. - I love you. - I love you too. â€˜Ankitha may not know that the one she loved then and now is Abhi.â€™ â€˜But, her heart knows it.â€™ â€˜Heart never forgets true love.â€™ â€˜Love is a wonder in this beautiful world.â€™ â€˜Love has troubles and sorrows along with happiness.â€™ â€˜Beyond all that, Love should remain as a good memory in our heart and life.â€™ Bike is easier than bicycle. What would you do if I leave? I will wait until you come back. Okayâ€¦ Whatâ€™s next?
