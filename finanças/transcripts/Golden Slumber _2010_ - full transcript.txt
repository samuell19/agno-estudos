7th floor. This elevator is going down. Nanami, hurry. The elevator's here. You can't swing that around here. No, Daddy, don't let her take it, Sorry. - Sorry. - Behave yourself, Honey. 3rd floor, going down. Did I surprise you? What? That's what this serial killer says as he stabs his victims. I read it in a tabloid. You read tabloids? He's known as Kill-0. That guy back in the elevator... I was half expecting him to say, ''Did I surprise you?'' What's wrong? Nanami? Nanami. It's dangerous to wander off. Alright, When's Dad coming home? The day after tomorrow? When you start eating peppers. He doesn't have to come back then. Poor Daddy... ''Serial Killer, watch out for this man, '' It's been so long, When did you come back to Sendai? Last year. What? How come? You know, things happen. Like what? Well Aoyagi, you broke up with Haruko. And you, Aoyagi... You became famous when you saved a pop idol. And you... ls that my fault? - Yes, it is. - Well, sorry. Are we fishing in the sea or river? What do I need... Where's your fishing gear? I give it an A minus. How come? It's popular but not too crowded and middle-aged men like us blend into it's homely atmosphere. You haven't changed. Remember our Food Culture Research Club? Friendship through fast food. I bet it didn't last. After we graduated I heard that Kazu found 10 new club members. Keeping logs of fast-food joints and menus... Who would join such a club? You were the enthusiastic one, I was young and silly. Nice car, when did you buy it? Are we eating here? The prawn's mine. Are you here for the Prime Minister? The parade? No, I'm not interested. I'm sorry, What are you doing? You can have this. You've always eaten fries like that. Some things never change. Do you know what a man's strengths are? No... One is his habits. And trust. Habits and trust. Golden Slumber When pop idol Rinka returned to her hometown in Sendai a burglar broke into her condominium. Luckily she was rescued when a young deliveryman came by. Mr. Aoyagi knocked him down with a leg sweep! He saved my life! I don't know how to thank him. Any comments, Mr. Aoyagi? Sorry but I have packages to deliver. You knocked the thief down with a leg sweep. Is that judo? A college friend taught me that one technique! Rock'n'roll! Boy, I dozed off, Did you put something in this? Yep, I put a sedative in it. I put it in the lid with a syringe. ls that right. It's the Beatles... The lullaby. It's Golden Slumbers from Abbey Road. It's a song about the way you once took home. It reminds me of the fun we had in college. When I hear get back homeward I remember how we were back in those days. You're so sentimental, Was it the major outer reap? What's that? When you threw the burglar... I only know one judo technique. I boasted to my kid that I'd taught you that. Your kid, A kid? You have a child? I married straight after college. He's at elementary school. Oh, my God, I moved to Tokyo... and married my pregnant girlfriend. She was an avid slot player. She was addicted to it. She took the kid there everyday. And before we knew it, we were in debt. I defaulted on my debt obligations. What kind of bullshit law school talk is that? Morita, are you okay? I hit rock bottom repaying the debts. Then I got a call. It was a suspicious offer. My debts would be canceled if I did what they asked. What did they want? My task was to bring you to this car today. And then I was to sedate you until 12:30. Who are they? Aoyagi. Has anything strange happened to you recently? No. Have you met anybody recently? No, Oh, yes... I was at a manga-cafe the other day. Hey, This computer doesn't work, ls it my fault? Or is somebody harassing me? She sounds suspicious. She doesn't, She approached you. Well, she did... - Did she ask you to hand out fliers? - What? Remember what we talked about back in college? The Beatles...? One... Two... Three and four, - The major outer reap? - No, damn it, You don't have to yell. Look behind us. It's Prime Minister Kaneda's parade. I was told to get you here behind the parade, Aren't we fishing? Listen, Aoyagi. They'll make you into a Lee Harvey Oswald. Oswald...? Who is he? He's the one who was framed as JFK's killer. They made him hand out communist fliers before the assassination. Who's they? Somebody in power. They created this image of him as an activist. It was just an image. It's all about image. How about you? I didn't hand out fliers... You saved that pop idol 2 years ago. That made you an instant celebrity, a hero. Oh, that... I think... the Prime Minister will be assassinated in this parade. So? What's the punch line? It's your image, you see, A man who posed as a hero kills the Prime Minister. - What's that? - Aoyagi, you have to think, - Think what? - Don't be gullible, Don't drink water offered to you. When you're invited on a fishing trip don't go and buy fishing gear, See? It's a bomb. There's one under us too. I checked the car while you were out cold. This car's rigged. It's a bomb that even someone like me can recognize. - We'd better run... - You run. Come on, Morita. I can't, If I run, my family will be in danger. Two policemen are approaching us. The explosion was over there but they are coming this way. Listen, Aoyagi. Run. If you have to, crawl your way out of here. Escape at all costs. Stay alive. As long as you're alive, there's a way. Aoyagi. Did you do it? With the pop idol? Do what? Freeze, Morita. Don't move, What's this? What's going on? What's happening to me? What's going on? Hello? Aoyagi? Come to my place. You should see the news. It's major! Hi, Koume. Koume? Prime Minister Kaneda's homecoming parade began at 12 noon. The explosion occurred at 12:15. There was a big explosion! The area is covered with thick smoke. The cause of the explosion is not clear. But we do get some idea from the video. Above the Prime Minister's open top limousine there's a suspicious object hovering. It appears to be an RC helicopter. There is a possibility that it was an act of terrorism. The Prime Minister's condition is still unknown. You want to try flying an RC helicopter? It's fun! She sounds suspicious. The helicopter's operator might still be in the area. That's right. Aoyagi, are you at my place now? Yes, I am. But... Where are you? The latest on the bomb attack on Prime Minister Kaneda. At 1:40 pm, Prime Minister Kaneda was pronounced dead. The police must prevent the perpetrator's escape. For the next several hours all public transportation will stop temporarily... ls the city of Sendai in a state of siege? How about the impact on citizens' lives? So you mean for the sake of citizens and uninterrupted business we should let the perpetrator escape? If that's what you're suggesting, we'll consider it. Can I watch TV on this? Yes, with the tuner, you can. The National Police Agency arrived very quickly. What's your point? It's better than not showing up. Sendai Police have an announcement. There was a bomb attack in Sendai... All train services are temporarily out of service. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated. This is a police announcement. Hey, Mr. Aoyagi! It's been a while! What's with calling me Mister? You're a grade above me... So I should call you Mister. Hello? Are you there? The connection's bad. Can I come over? I know it's short notice... Are you busy? How have you been anyway, Mr. Aoyagi! What's with this ''Mister?'' ls that hip now? Where are you, Mister Aoyagi? - I'm near the park. - Hey, what's up? Give me a ride. The bus hasn't come and I've got a blind date. The bus services have stopped. I'll call you later. A blind date? What about me? So the buses aren't running? I don't know what's going on. There are cops all over. What's today? Is it Safe Driving Week? No, there was a bomb attack at noon... A bomb attack? What do you mean? The Prime Minister was hit. Didn't you know? What happened? The Prime Minister exploded, Shit, He exploded? Where do you want to go? Get in the car and tell us more. Right, get in, Aoyagi... ls it okay? Are you coming in? Huh? I mean, come in please. Kazu... Listen... Morita has... Aoyagi, did you do it? Did you really do it? No. Of course I didn't do it. Oh, you didn't? Who would pass on the chance of sleeping with a pop idol? Oh, that... Come on, I'm serious. Everyone thought you were a hero, All the girls wanted you. The pop idol said she owed you her life, Okay, I did do it. She told me to come to a hotel suite. She wanted to thank me. It was a long night. She screamed out, ''I'm dying, '' Oh, my God... that's awesome. I have to take this. You can watch TV. You're watching footage provided by a viewer. It was captured on the surveillance camera at a book depository warehouse near the bomb site. Here, the suspect is controlling the helicopter. As he escapes in the elevator his face can be clearly seen. Everything OK? Yeah... well sort of. Was it your girlfriend? Well... she said she was coming over. I see, I'm on my way then. Erm... On your way out you'll find a diner on your left. Wait for me there. Once I explain things to her, you can come back. Don't worry. No, it would be good to talk to you after so long. Okay, call me later then. Sorry about this. I don't know what I'm doing. Here's your order, Baked Chicken and Bacon Rice. Use the pepper sauce if you like. Uh, miss, can I sit at that table over there? No problem. Excuse me. Erm... You're the deliveryman, I'm your fan, Oh, my God, I knew it was you, It is you, Can I have your autograph? Okay, I'll do it over there. Thank you very much, - Here you go. - Please, go ahead. Thank you. This is great, Excuse me. Sorry. Coming through, Kazu, is she still there? Masaharu Aoyagi. Who are you? I'm with the National Police Agency. I know you're the perpetrator. Aoyagi, You've got to get away! They'll do anything... What's going on? What do you think? You're hurting Kazu... We wouldn't do that, - Aoyagi! - Kazu! You've committed the most heinous crime. You've assassinated Japan's prime minister. It's a national emergency. In situations like this, things get a little rough. Look what the Americans do. How many civilians are killed in the hunt for one terrorist leader? This is not America. Thank God it isn't, too. But the fact remains that you're him. I didn't do it, You did. All criminals say they didn't do it. Okay, I did it then. Am I off the hook now? There is a way to help your friend. Turn yourself in to the nearest authorities. Or you can come here. Why would I? You don't seem to understand. Yes, I do. Morita told me. Morita...? Oh, the man you killed. Killed? You put a bomb under his car. You know that. ''Incoming - Mr. Aoyagi'' Where are you? I'm leaving Sendai now. I'm not coming to Kazu. You're wasting your time there. It's the suspect. He called from Kokubun Town. He said he'd take a bus but I doubt it. Kazu... I thought you were in Kokubun Town. I received a call from your phone. I traced it to Kokubun Town. It was your voice too. But then I got a report from our people. We have extra cameras around because of the serial killer and you weren't seen on any of them. Instead there was a drunk couple playing with a cell phone and a device. City under surveillance. Tomorrow your photo will go public. Because of your celebrity status, it'll be a media event. But I'm innocent. Evidence keeps turning up. We have an image of you at the shop buying the helicopter. I've never bought one, A citizen gave us video footage of you flying it by the river. When you were on the roof... I didn't do it, ...you were seen on a surveillance camera. It's clearly you. It's an imposter... I was told to give you a chance to turn yourself in. ''Police Box'' You are not cuffed. Turn yourself in before you're a wanted man. We'll do everything to protect you from any conceivable trouble. For example... We can get you sympathy by feeding stories to the press. So you manipulate the facts. It's all image. Images are manipulated. It's all about image. You are drowning. You'll sink faster if you resist. In desperation, you might take the others with you. But if you do as I say you'll keep your head above water. Don't worry. Don't be afraid. Don't worry. You disappoint me. That's a dummy handle. That door can only be opened from outside. You didn't work alone... Did I surprise you? Freeze, ''Alleged Assassin'' A manhunt for Masaharu Aoyagi has begun. The 30-year-old deliveryman is a Sendai resident. He became an overnight celebrity saving pop idol Rinka 2 years ago. A burglar broke into Rinka's condo when the suspect turned up coincidentally. The suspect... A college friend taught me that one technique! Rock'n'roll! He had a knife. Weren't you scared? ''Sendai Delivery Services'' ''Request a Pick-up'' ''Select a date'' ''Today'' ''Unavailable'' ''Tomorrow'' ''Morning'' ''Largest packaging'' ''Request confirmed'' Did I surprise you? Erm... Thanks for... that. It's nothing. I was after that guy with the headphones. He almost killed me once. I wanted revenge. But I missed him again, Who are you anyway? You're the assassin, Can I shake your hand? It wasn't me. I didn't do it. If you leave your cell phone on, they'll find you. If you want to hide, you'd better throw it away. I already have. Very clever. You can assume that your calls are bugged. ''Serial Killer Wanted, '' There's no similarity. - No, there isn't. - Hell no, Kill-0 is younger with bigger eyes and a wider forehead. So... you really are Kill-0? Did I surprise you? ls this your place? No way. It's theirs. You think I killed a man with a son? No... It was their dream to go on a motorcycle trip. So I brought them a motorcycle with a sidecar. I wonder what part of Japan they are in now. Many of you may remember this face. Suspect Aoyagi rescued a pop idol 2 years ago... Oh, that was you, I knew I'd seen you somewhere, I see... this is a well written scenario. It's a bull's eye, People love a handsome hero falling from grace. Unpredictably the criminal is your average man, This is big. He saved my life, I don't know how to thank him. Thank him? Is that all? - Anything else? - I'm just so grateful. Eat while it's hot. Yeah. Do you think I drugged it? No... No American influence! No Cabinet establishment! Every time he made controversial remarks Secretary Ebisawa had to deal with the media backlash. We all thought Ebisawa was to be the prime minister. In this emergency Ebisawa is the most likely replacement. Maybe I did spike your food. The only source of strength left for me is to trust people. You look sleepy. It's a golden slumber... Golden Slumbers... A Beatles hit. Slumber means sleepy... Sorry but I did spike the noodles. You did? You'd better rest, Aoyagi. Rejuvenate. Life as a fugitive is tough. Here. This cell phone belonged to a man whose body hasn't been found yet. You can use it. Body...? Change your clothes too. You are so conspicuous. Take this, too. Just in case. See you again. I'll call you if something occurs to me. Where is it? Over there, Hurry. The door's unlocked. Whose car is this? I don't know. Dry yourself. Whose are they? I don't know but... It's not old. No, It's disgusting, But you'll catch a cold. I think they're Kazu's. ls this Kazu's car? No, it isn't... The heater doesn't work. I think the battery has to be replaced. Really? Really. If you're alone, that's alright. With two of you, it's alright too. What's that? The jingle for this car. If there's three of you, no complaints. With five of you, it's even better. It makes you a bit happier, Toyota Corolla! - Say, Haruko. - Yeah? I've been meaning to ask you... Do you want to go out with me? Where? Shopping? No, that's not what I mean. You're too slow, What's taken you so long? I guess this isn't good zoo weather. Why? The animals won't come out of their cages. Really? The monkeys I want to see are under cover. Which monkeys? What are they...? They're black and white. Beautiful fur... Aby... something. Something Columbus... Columbus? What was it? Aby... Aby... - Abby Road. - Wrong. - Did you remember it? - Yes, I did. About this car. I overheard Kazu whispering about it. ''When you don't have cash for a love hotel...'' Kazu always calls you Mr. Aoyagi when he's hiding something. - Oh, does he? - He does. He said, ''Use it whenever you need to, Mr. Aoyagi.'' Was he talking about this car? Am I right? ls this your emergency love hotel? Did somebody use the towel for that purpose? No, no. I'm sure that's new. Kazu said he leaves new ones for the next guy. The next guy? No, That's gross, The Prime Minister and his wife slowly approach the crowd in their car. Can you see them waving to the excited onlookers? Here on Jozenji Avenue in Sendai, the City of Woods... Can you see the Prime Minister? No. There was a big explosion! The area is covered with thick smoke. Step back, it's dangerous! Prime Minister Kaneda's parade started at 12 noon. The explosion occurred at 12:15. There was a big explosion! Would you come home if something happened to us? Of course I would. Well, can't you just pretend something happened to us? No, I can't leave now. See you in 2 days. Okay, see you then. Was it Daddy? He'll come home when you start eating cucumbers. He doesn't have to come back then. Poor daddy, This is the suspect. Aoyagi is known for rescuing a pop idol from a burglar 2 years ago. With us is a reporter who interviewed him at the time. Aoyagi... He gave the impression of being a clean-cut nice guy. I recall his hostile stare he occasionally had. What are you up to? ''Calling Shingo Morita'' The number you dialed is out of service range. Let's look into the past of this criminal mastermind. Who is this man? What's he done wrong? What's your guess? He's doesn't look bad. He's handsome. I think I like him. You're my daughter. ''Calling Kazu Ono'' Hello? Sorry, wrong number. Are you Haruko Higuchi? Uh, yes... Weren't Kazu and you in the same club at college? Who is this man? My college friend. Kazu Ono is my mother's boyfriend. He was conscious when you found him? Just barely. He said something about Aoyagi. and the police, too. He said ''they got me'' and ''Aoyagi saved me.'' He always boasted about being Aoyagi's friend. He kept telling me how famous he was. He told me, too. Do you know Mr. Ono? We're with the National Police Agency. How do you know him? We were in the same college club. The Food Culture Research Club. Uh... that's right. We're doing our best to apprehend Aoyagi. Could you give me your number please? My phone number? Aoyagi might try to reach you. If he did, we'd be able to trace his call. You want to bug her cell phone? By detaining a suspicious caller for 30 seconds, we can find him. What proof do you have that Aoyagi is guilty? Don't you watch the news? He was filmed buying a radio-controlled helicopter. Many witnesses saw him escape the scene. He shot his gun in a diner. He also shot an officer who's now in a coma. This was videotaped 3 days before the assassination. This helicopter is just like the one the perpetrator used. Looks like he's been cornered. No, he's just got started. A delivery guy who becomes an amateur hit man won't last. Are there pro and amateur killers? Well, being from the underworld I know what I'd do. I'd go underground. In tunnels? Listen, Tanaka. Every city has an underground water system. To be precise there is a network of storm drains and then there's sewage. The suspect, Masaharu Aoyagi had a part-time job at a place called Todoroki Pyrotechniques. He was a college student at the time. ''Pyrotechniques'' refers to commercial fireworks. He may have learnt about explosives at this time. Nobody touches my explosives, It would have been easy to smuggle out some black powder... Impossible, Even an ant couldn't get past our security. I'm a pro. It's impossible. Don't waste your time. That's huge, ls that a sewage pipe? The big tube's for large shells. It's for the grand finale, I thought you ignited fireworks with a lit match in a tube and ran before it went kaboom, No, it's computer controlled. You know how to use computers? Hey, fireworks used to be a pastime for aristocrats. It's cutting edge technology. So computers don't scare me. One finger, Look at you type, How about you, Aoyagi? You're the same with switches. He is, It's like Thumbs up, What's wrong? Nothing. Enjoy the fireworks. What's up with him? It's his son. The one who's in Tokyo? Looks like he's decided to stay on there. I knew this place has closed, Iwasaki. What are you doing, Aoyagi? I'm here for a pick-up. It's for me. I ordered it online. What the...? You're in deep shit, you know? Yes, I know. I know it wasn't you. You're not the type to do that kind of thing. Why are you crying? You're the only one who seems to believe me... What do you want me to deliver? ls everything OK at the company? Who's covering for me? Aoyagi. This is no time to worry about your work. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. I owe you one, you know. - You do...? - Yeah. Back when you were famous I told this hostess that I was your mentor at work. By dropping your name I got laid. Iwasaki. Delivering something? Hey, President, use the stairs. It'll keep you slimmer. Wait a minute... Iwasaki. What are you here for, a delivery? A pick-up. I was called here to pick this up. But all the other tenants have moved out of here. Are your ready? 1, 2, 3, go, Thanks, man. Now... Which way, north or south? North please. Rock'n'roll. ls it? Aoyagi. Yes. Tell me. Did you sleep with her? ls that all people care about? I'm dying, I'm dying, Don't kill me, So cosmetic surgeons really perform miracles, That's right. Not that I've ever had any done. Never. There's a really good surgeon in Sendai. So they say... The other day, he did some work for a Hollywood star... He made over another guy to look like the star. So he could evade the paparazzi. Do they look the same? If the bone structure is similar, it can be done. The clerk says that the suspect was inquisitive. The crime happened in Sendai so we must solve it. The lines are open, if you have seen Masaharu Aoyagi please get in touch. Producer Yajima speaking. Many callers claim to be Masaharu Aoyagi... They're just looking for notoriety. You're the first to say that you were framed. Well, I didn't do it. Can you prove who you really are? If I can, will you announce my innocence on TV? First we'll have to verify if it's true. It won't go to air if it's untrue. They say I'm the suspect on TV without proof, I don't follow you, sir. Hello? Hello? Hello! You know, the thing about rock'n'roll is that it's simple. You play the guitar. Da-da-dan, With a single cord. - I see. - Just like rock'n'roll, I'll keep this simple. I'm handing you over to the authorities. It should arrive any minute. The truck's here, Don't worry, I'll open it, You, get him, I'll stab him, Don't shoot, He'll stab me. Drop it, Aoyagi. You can't run. Keep away, You can't run. Keep away, You, don't shoot, We trained here. I remember. Cars can't get through here. Run to the back. The fence behind apartment 10 has a hole in it. I'm sorry... No need to apologise. I got laid thanks to you. I'll tell your wife. Go ahead if you manage to resolve things. - They'll shoot us... - They won't. People have too much free time. They're recording you, Now go, Hey, He's getting away, Stop him, Don't be tight-assed. What's that thing? Can I have half of this? Somebody gave it to me at work. Go ahead. Listen... Maybe we should separate. What? Just now when you split the chocolate in half... You checked which was bigger... And then gave me the bigger half. I guess I did. Here. That's the way I like it. No fussing. You'd leave me for that...? I know it doesn't make sense. But I've given it some thought. We've become too used to each other. Wait a minute... You know the insight of those words were so timely. What the Sea-man said. ''Don't be tight-assed...'' It's about us, Aoyagi. We have new footage to show you. This happened about an hour ago. A viewer filmed it on his cell phone. This happened about an hour ago. the suspect was cornered by police at the Kamo housing complex. He then resorted to taking his colleague hostage. and escaped. The video caught the very moment of his escape. The surveillance cameras also caught him frantically running away from the police blockade. This is good! Very well recorded. I can see he's a good deliveryman. Look at his precise footwork! He's a mover. But as long as he's on foot I guess he won't leave Sendai. Not with the blockades. Right. Next, the weather. It's time for the KHB weather report. Look at this beautiful white monkey! It's a baby Abyssinian Colobus, born at Yagiyama Zoo. Adult Abyssinian Colobus monkeys have black and white fur. Mom, we never go to the zoo anymore. The baby is white all over. How cute it is! It's still too young to be shown to the public. With these cute animals behind me, here's the weather... Welcome to Autobacs, - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm looking for a car battery. Which model? Model...? It's just a car. ls it a compact car? Maybe it's not that small... Do you need to know the model? There are many different kinds of cars. If you're alone, that's alright. With two of you, that's alright too. If there's three of you, no complaints. With five of you, it's even better. It makes you a bit happier, Toyota Corolla! It's right over there. I got it, Can you tell me how to install it? Why do we need this at the zoo? Why do you think we're going to the zoo? Alright, there you go. Where are you off to? Do I have to answer? It'd be very helpful if you complied. Who's that scary man? There's a much scarier terrorist at large. Mom, I have to pee. What? Oh, you have to go to toilet. Let's go over there. Do you mind? It is against the law. This is an emergency. It's an emergency, Watch your step. Go first. Can you get through? Ms. Higuchi, what's in the bag? Personal items, you know toiletries. It's an emergency, Did I surprise you? I thought not. ''I didn't do it, Masaharu Aoyagi'' Did your teacher mark your schoolwork with circles? If it had petals it was ''Excellent.'' ''Good'' was just a circle. If we went on like this... the best we'd get would be ''Good.'' Don't be so depressed. You look so down and out. Don't look around like that, The car works now. After you left, somebody else turned up. Now it has a new battery so it should start. I think so, anyway. Who would have done that? I'm not sure. I guess it was someone you know. But that kid really should be kept out of this. A kid? Get in the car. Shiro-yagi, the white goat sent a letter Kuro-yagi, the black goat ate it without reading it So the black goat had to write to the white goat ''Please tell me what was your letter about?'' Ao-yagi, the scapegoat sent a letter... Start... Start, Morita... I got the car to start... ls that something to cry about? ''I didn't do it, Masaharu Aoyagi.'' ''I knew you didn't.'' Todoroki-yah, Morita-yah, Higuchi-yah, Aoyagi-yah, Fireworks can be seen in many places. You're watching them here. Maybe a long lost friend is watching them somewhere else. That's a nice thought, isn't it? Yes. Your friend might even be thinking the same thing as you. The same thing? Usually the same things trigger shared memories. Your friend might remember the same thing as you. Maybe your son is watching too. Enough chat, Now for the big shell, All together now, 1, 2, 3, Todoroki-yah, Hello? That car really sticks out! Watch out for the blockades. What else? I have an idea that might help you. Let's find the imposter. I bet he's had cosmetic surgery, Right. There's a great surgeon in Sendai. I knew it. How will we find him? I've found him. He's at the Sendai Medical Center. Do you know it? Who do you think I am? The Prime Minister killer. No, a deliveryman. It's such a good idea, Access to a hospital is minimal and it's monitored. There's food too so it's the ideal hideout. Who's your informer? The man who did the imposter's face job. You know the surgeon? Yes, he did my face too. Why else would I have this huge forehead? He's over there. Maybe this is a trap. You're sharp, Very good, Aoyagi. The people who are after you were prepared for the possibility that you'd come here. Prepared...? They leaked the information about where the imposter is. But it turned out to be a setup. I have to apologize to you. I was given the wrong information. He jumped at me when I turned back the cover. So naturally I reacted. - Who's doing this...? - Me, it was me, Don't go lecturing me either, Not you, The ones who framed me and harmed my friends. Even people who are unrelated are being killed. Who are they...? Who are the ones behind this plot? You're up against some powerful people, Aoyagi. Maybe it's safe to call them the Authorities. The smartest thing for you to do is to run. ls that all? Whoops, sorry. It looks like I'm out of time. I helped you out on impulse, that was my downfall. Why didn't you tell me? It's your fault, Aoyagi. You're the killer, You're right... Oh, that surprised me... Hello. ls this Miura's cell phone? ls his name Miura? He can't speak at the moment. And is this... the fugitive himself? And you're the plastic surgeon? Can you give Miura a message? The information was wrong. There's no imposter in the hospital. You went to the hospital... I'm very sorry. What will you do now? All I can do is run. How...? - Watch out, - Sorry, I'm sorry. - Here. - Young fella. You're cornered. ls it that bad? I know you're doing your best. If you get caught, make sure it's in public. Where there are crowds and TV cameras. That way you get to see it on TV, No, so that the police can't shoot you. After they frame you they'll shoot you if they get the chance. It shuts you up and the case is closed. I have connections with the underground... if you know what I mean. To be precise the sewer has two pipes. One's the storm drain. And the other one's for sewerage. If it's a fine day, use the storm drains. In some places, they're big enough to walk through. Call me, OK? Young fella. If you think you'd rather die than get caught it's no good. Death is no escape. Haruko, It's been so long. I had a dream... What about? The fireworks. Remember? They were incredible. They went kaboom above us, The sound distracted me so I missed out on seeing you kiss Aoyagi for the first time. The big kaboom, The sound made us all look up... And... what happened? Did you two kiss? Yes, Mom. Did you kiss Aoyagi? Nothing gets by you, Nanami. ls she your girl? ls that right... Really... You've had a hard time... It's been much worse for Aoyagi. The news is all lies, I heard about it from my girlfriend. He's still on the run, right? It all started when I effectively sold-out Aoyagi to the police... The police called me. They said to call them when Aoyagi contacted me. Right after the assassination. That's fast... It sure was. They said they'd be checking my calls for a while. I guess they bugged my phone... They did the same with me. Straight after the police hung up, Aoyagi called. Talk about bad timing... I knew the police were listening so I panicked. Even worse, Aoyagi came over, I couldn't think straight any more. Aoyagi left that in my apartment. The Beatles. It's Golden Slumbers. I know what the song is about now. We knew how to get back home once... Now we all got older and... The Beatles kept making masterpieces until the very end. Even if they hated each other. Did Paul put together The Medley? That's right. The others went home but he stayed in a 4-tatami-mat room alone putting songs together. It wasn't a 4-tatami-mat room. It's just what I imagined. What was Paul thinking then...? I guess he wanted things to be how they'd been. He wanted them back together again. Suspect Masaharu Aoyagi, age 30. He's 175 cm, of medium build, and was wearing... ''Officer Yasuo Kojima'' Sorry, Officer Kojima but I'm not a killer. The suspect must be tired and desperate. He might resort to something drastic. Something drastic... Officer Kojima. The police are using a decoy who looks like me. He's had plastic surgery. That's who you've seen on TV. I know it sounds unbelievable. Here comes the suspect's father. Father! Father! Shut up! Don't call me that! You're not my children! Do you feel responsible as the father? Can you give me your name? The police have officially named your son as the perpetrator. Do you know anything about my son? I've known him since he came to this world, butt naked. My wife has known him since conception! His first steps, first words... I've seen it all! I know everything about him. You want to trust your son... It's not about what I want. I know him! He didn't do it. Wait a minute, sir...! Put the camera on me. I want to say something. Everybody, be quiet! Listen, Masaharu! While you are hiding things are getting out of hand. You hear me? Totally out of control, sir! He called me sir... Anyhow we can take care of ourselves. Your mother's doing so-so. So you take care of yourself! Be quiet! Masaharu, you know what to do. Get out of here! What are you saying? Are you hiding something? Why are you crying...? My father is a regular office clerk. But he hates those gropers on the trains. Boy, he hates them, When he saw a man touching a girl on the train, he beat him up. I remember once I had some calligraphy homework. Other kids wrote things like The First Sunrise. Dad made me write, Death to Gropers. Make sure you keep your calls under 30 seconds. I'm just talking to myself. Yaji-yaji-yaji Yajima speaking, Identify yourself! You reporters could ruin a man's life! Do you accept responsibility? Mr. Aoyagi! He's impossible. No sense of parental responsibility. Sorry to have bothered you. I was telling him about you, Mom. So you know the suspect. I heard him... This old man... Don't call me old, ...This old man was calling Aoyagi on his phone. You talk too much... That's right. This is a secret. I knew him from college, that's all. I know him too. You're his old friend but I'm a new one. What do you mean? He's going to take a big gamble. If he's innocent he should just give himself up. It would be better to come forward... And then what? What would happen then? The police won't shoot you without reason. They would, If he just came out, he'd be a sitting duck. Anyway, Aoyagi has to be where there are TV cameras. And he can't get caught in the meantime. That's the plan. But aren't manholes too heavy to lift? Hell yeah. Hey, come on, This would be 60 kilos... if it was the real thing. Can't he just escape through this? No, storm drains eventually become too narrow. All he can do is to go from one manhole to another. A hostage? Who do you have? Why complicate things? If I give myself up you'll shoot to kill and the case will be closed. If you come alone, I'll hand myself over. A double circle for ''Good.'' Don't you have to gag me? Trust is a man's greatest strength. Then you can take off the cuffs... That might be taking things too far. Right... Everything I need. Will Masaharu Aoyagi really turn himself in? We interrupt momentarily to show you the police in action. The sniper squad, They won't shoot him, It would be a public execution if they did. They have tranquilizer guns. It'll be public anesthesia. Tranquilizer guns? That's new to me... They've just started using them. Aoyagi might have thought he'd be safe with people around. But he was wrong, 10 points to the police. We'll have full coverage of the suspect turning himself in. Exclusive on the KHB News. Stay tuned and you'll see it right here. Mommy's got to go. Haruko Higuchi? Who are you? Hello? ls that Yaji-yaji-yaji Yajima? Speaking, Everything is on schedule. Ready for my TV appearance? Sure thing. Go for it, It's our live exclusive, He's here, It's Aoyagi. How did you get here? I am Masaharu Aoyagi. I didn't do it. What are you doing there, We've got to run, Wait, I didn't do anything... Hey, get off, Haruko, Yesterday at noon I met my old friend Morita after he'd contacted me. We were supposed to go fishing. But then Morita revealed what he'd got me there for. I was to be used like Lee Harvey Oswald. You know... Oswald was framed as the prime suspect in the JFK killing. One... Two... Three! 2 months ago I was approached by a woman whose hobby was RC helicopters. And she... What's going on...? Hello? Are you there, Yajima? We can't get the studio? Switch cameras. What is this? Everybody together now, 1, 2, 3, Go... Aoyagi-yah..., Holy shit, Way to go, Todoroki-yah, ''Todoroki Pyrotechniques'' Men, assemble, I found him. He's down here. Send men round to all the manholes, Was he the real one? Was he really... Masaharu Aoyagi? We made it just in time. What's wrong? We covered all possibilities. The manhole on the stage is a dummy. If things got out of hand, jump in there. But how...? Good question. If you open the manhole on the stage the police would surely open fire. But... That's when fireworks will go off. There'll be big distracting kabooms. Then you can escape. That's their plan. Who are they? You have many creative friends. Get out of there by heading west. It will lead you to Hirose River. Listen, Aoyagi. Run. If you have to, crawl your way out of here. Escape at all costs. Stay alive. As long as you're alive, there's a way. You'll be at Hirose River at daybreak. I'll send someone to pick you up. Pick me up? Who will that be? There's a women I know well who's concerned about your misfortune. You actually made it. How have you been? I owe you a favor. I have a question. Shoot. You had a face job, didn't you? I... I did not, No way. Latest on the prime minister assassination. A body found at Sendai Port yesterday was identified as the man who killed the Prime Minister the fugitive suspect, Masaharu Aoyagi. Back in May, Aoyagi assassinated Prime Minister Kaneda in a parade. He'd rigged a bomb to an RC helicopter. Two days later after a showdown with police in the park Aoyagi vanished without a trace. Finding the suspect's body brings closure to a crime that shook the nation. Prime Minister Ebisawa expressed relief from the White House where he's visiting. How many times do I have to tell you? Aoyagi really did threaten us. He's right. Then why didn't you ask the police for protection? Yeah, we must have been crazy, If you insist on hiding what you know your factory may not be able to continue operating. That's terrible. Sendai's fireworks wouldn't be the same without us. Just when my son decided to join my business. Officer. You can be honest with me. Do you really think Aoyagi killed the Prime Minister? Of course... What? Of course he did or didn't? The aubergine has a flower. The aubergine has a flower. The aubergine's blossomed, Dear, I was getting the mail. Don't disappear like that, This one doesn't have the sender's name on it. More hate mail. This whole thing has toughened us up. You were always tough. No razor enclosed. You're not exactly delicate yourself. I've decided not to worry. What's wrong, Dear? This mail shows some humor. ''Death to Gropers'' I'm home. I'm back. What's wrong? I got a visit from a strange man. He told me that you had an affair with a hostess. Aoyagi... No, You know Aoyagi is dead. Okay, I see, - What? Who did you sleep with? - That's rock alright, Rock'n'roll... Give me a beer, Rock my ass, You cheated on me, We're here. Wake up. It's home, sweet home, Who are you? Have you been traveling across Japan? How do you know that? You lent out your apartment for this motorcycle? What do you want from me? Well... I thought you'd died long ago. Thank God, You are alive. You're spooking me, Hey, wake up. 7th floor. This elevator is going down. Nanami, hurry. The elevator's come. You can't swing that around here. No, Daddy, don't let her take it, Sorry. - Sorry. - Behave yourself, Honey. 3rd Floor, this elevator is going down. Sir. Mom told me to stamp you with this.
