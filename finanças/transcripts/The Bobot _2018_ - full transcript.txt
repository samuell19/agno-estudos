Subtitles by explosiveskull Billions of years ago, on the outskirts of the universe, on one of the planets, life was born. It developed for millions of years, and then, across the universe, humans happened. We conquered the evolution game. Successfully taking control of our own planet earth. Now we're looking at the stars, hoping to, one day, explore other worlds and take control over them. What we don't know is that we're only a pawn in someone else's game. Now they're back to claim whats theirs. He's alive. You said he should walk on his own. And he's walking. - Yes, like a robot. - Are you sure you're not lying? No, I swear we're not lying. - Check it out. Take a look. - Yes, take a look. It's not the one I'm looking for. We got them from the village. Give us a few pieces. Please, come on. - One for me. - One for me. Where is it? - Here it is. - I got it. - Yes! - Sancho, give us a light. Victor jumps first. Next is Vadyk. Then me, then you. Ah! Guys, this is cool! Come on! - No. - Scared? - I'm not scared. - He's such a baby. I bet his grandma won't let him. I can't jump because a spider bit me and they're afraid of heights. Oh, come on. Why do they weave their webs? They're afraid to fall to the ground. Such a liar. I'm not a liar. Whoever doesn't jump is a loser! What's global warming? There will be an explosion of the sun. I saw it on TV. Last time it happened was 500 years ago. I heard all computers are going to melt soon. How are they going to melt? They are inside buildings. Ha! What's that? I've heard a camp counselor talk about a guy who keeps tying himself to an electrical transformer. They even tried calling the police. Probably just a psycho. Quiet! It's glitching. Mine too. Guys, lets get out here before we get caught. People call them "lightning hunters". They tie themselves to transformers to get hit by ball lightning. What for? Some say ball lightning is the source of eternal energy. If you get hit by it, you'll have endless power. That's a story. They can even make batteries that last forever. A friend of mine told me all about it. Hurry up, losers! Ravens! Ravens! Lightning! Ready? Come on! Go! Come on! Let's go! What are you doing? Woo! - Yes! - Yes! LIGHTNING - 15 RAVENS - 15 Ravens! Ravens! Ravens! Come on! Come on! Yeah! Nice! - Lightning! - That's right! - Lightning! - Come on! Come on! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! LIGHTNING - 16 RAVENS - 15 Time out. - Lightning! - Yeah! Guys, come here. Hurry. Over here. Guys, you need to focus. Time is almost done. You need to concentrate, okay? We can do this. Come on. Let's show them what we've got. Ravens! - Ravens! - Lightning! - Ravens! - Lightning! - Ravens! - Lightning! Ravens! My grandma? - Will you send me the photos? - Sure, what's your e-mail? Do you want me to write it down for you? - It's fine. I've got it. - All right. - Yes. - Ravens, are you ready? - Go ravens! - Ravens! - Ravens! - You can do it! Lightning! Lightning! Lightning! Woo! That's it! Yes! Yes! Yes! Boo! Boo! It was in. Let go! Everyone, calm down. Calm down. Guys, stop it. - Boo! - Guys, calm down. We have a referee, right? Svetlana, can you just tell us? Was it in or out? - It was out. - Any questions? Valera, you always talk about being a good role model. It seems like you're not playing fair at all today, as per usual. Excuse me, Kostya, but what exactly do you mean by "as per usual"? You just always seem to win last minute. - Is that so? - Yes, just like last year. You call yourselves "athletes", but, in reality, you only care about winning the championship cup at any cost. I'm sorry, but why exactly are you bringing this up? Valera, because I'm pretty sure it was in. - Maybe it was out. - It was in. - I'm sure it was out. - It was definitely in. I'm sure it was out! - You need to stop now! - It was out! - It was out! - It was definitely in! - It was in. - It was out. Hey, guys. It was in. I took a picture. Give me a second. Boo! You either show us the picture right now... It was definitely in. ...or the other team wins the game. Show us the picture. I'm sorry. Give me a second. - Boo! - Boo! There you have it! - Boo! - Boo! Guys, let's go. Come on. Yes! Yes! Yes! LIGHTNING - 17 RAVENS - 15 - Lightning! - Loser. Lightning! - Idiot. - Lightning! It's all your fault. You suck. Lightning! Lightning! You need to buzz off. Get lost. - Get away! - Which troop are you from? - From the seventh. You? - The second. - That's the guy from yesterday? - What? I couldn't believe it myself. It's crazy. Totally. I didn't think they would win. The eighth was the best. The third troop wasn't even ready. Due to the high temperatures, it is required for all members to wear protective hats and sunscreen at all times. Make sure you reapply sunscreen every two hours. I repeat. Due to the high temperatures, it is required for all members to wear protective hats and sunscreen at all times. Take this. - And you? - I'm not hungry. The boys went to counselor Kostya to ask him not to take you with us to the observatory. We should do something. Let's just get the memory card and get the stupid picture. - We'll show it to everyone. - Too late. I'm just going to leave camp. Visit grandma. She's in Kalynivka. LOSER VADYK So is that a camera? A Polaroid, my dad's. Are you leaving? Yes. But we actually won, you know? They really don't deserve it. Let's print the pictures and go to the headmaster. We still got the memory card with the picture in it. Let's show everyone who deserves to win the cup. - I'm stealing it. - Steal what? - The cup. - Awesome! - I've got it. - Here it goes. Huh? It's too far. Let's get closer. That's her building. Take a picture. I'm running out of film. Got I! We'll give the dog a sausage with a sleeping pill. Saw it in a movie the other day. I can get the sausage from the cafeteria. - And the pills? - The sleeping pills? Maybe we can get them from the nurse. I'm pretty sure we can find something in the infirmary. Just an idea. Guys, back to your rooms now. It's me. Oh! Take this. - I have one on my phone. - This one's a lot better. The battery will last longer. Take it. Thanks. Listen, if they catch me, I'm going back to my grandma. You better not say a word. - Maybe I should go with you. - No, it's too dangerous. And you better not say a word about the cup. That stupid dog. BUS STOP - ¿Are you going to Kalynivka? - Yes, sir. KALYNIVKA ¿Did you run away from the camp? Of course not. My grandma's sick. So they let me visit her. Sorry to hear that about your grandma. Dear grandma, I'm on my way to you right now. An epidemic broke out in the camp. Lux F.M. Hey, kid! Where are you going? Sancho! You there? Sancho! My god, Sancho, why? What are you doing? Well, I brought you the rope. And why on earth would I need one? To tie the dog. Just give it. Maybe I'll stay here and keep watch. Okay, just stay here. Don't move. - Are you sure we won? - I'm sure of it. Why did the kid say we lost? Why do you think he broke the camera? He saw the picture and didn't want to admit they lost. Isn't that a little too extreme? Valera, you can't be serious. Wrestling championship cup. Where is it? Oh, no! I'm not going in there! Maybe this will do the trick. Hey, stop! Give the cup back! You better give that back, you little thief! I'll promise you'll regret this! Come back! I'm going to get you! Ah! Ah! Come over here! Move it now! Come on! Ah! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Just... Stupid rope. Thank you for the power boost. That's incredible! - Can you see this? - Yes. Do you see it? It's happening! It truly is amazing. This is insane! - Have you seen this? - Yes, professor. I believe I have. We must not waste any time. I told him we deserved that cup, so he decided to steal it. He wanted the other boys to show him some respect. What did the cup look like? Well... Something like this. Just like this, but for wrestling. With handles. It was on the window sill. The boy probably grabbed the first thing he saw. And then I came in... And then I came in and scared him off. And there's a crazy man who lives in the hill. He ties himself to an electrical transformer to try to get hit by ball lightning. What crazy man? What are you talking about? I don't know. That's what I heard. So, Valera, was the ball in? - What are you talking about? - Come on, just forget about it. Listen, you are getting on my last nerve, Kostya. Maybe he's already back in his bed. Then, why call the cops? The boy is missing. His things are gone too. We don't know where he is. His grandma lives in Kalynivka. That's right, he does have a grandma in Kalynivka. Be right back. It looks just like the one you're looking for. It's a cup, a golden one. Like the one you showed me. There's this boy, a boy scout. A ten-year-old. Ten. We need to find the cup first. I'll deal with the boy later, okay? These fools can't do anything right. The police guy was talking about the cup with someone on the phone. He says he will search for the boy later. What does that mean? It means they're more worried about the cup than the boy. Don't you get it? That cop is weird. And the kid won't pick up his phone. - Where did he go? - Somewhere over there. - We'll find him ourselves. - What do you mean? - We'll do it together. - Right. - It's also your fault. - How's that? You didn't go after him. - But he's your kid. - We're both responsible for him. If we don't find him, you know, we'll both go to jail. How is it my fault? Criminal omission. Ever heard of it? We should go to Kalynivka. And how are we getting there? Great idea, genius. You plan on driving my car. I would use my car if I had one. And who would look over my troop? Svetlana will take care of it. We'll look for him in the forest and over the hill. If we don't find him, we'll go to Kalynivka. - Are you scared or something? - Have you ever seen me scared? Just give me your car. Ok, then. Take it. Don't wreak it. Mister Kostya, I promise I will never do it again. - It was never my idea. - You've done enough already. I can't untie this stupid rope. What do you want from me? Just let me go. I'm starving. Food is energy, you know? Energy is everywhere. We need it to survive. It has created everything. You mean your electrical transformer? - What transformer? - That one? The Bobot? No, energy. A long time ago we discovered fire. Then electricity changed everything. What was that? After two or three fundamental discoveries, technology's evolved. That's all it took. Technology is everything. Symbiosis. It's part of our daily lives. We channel this energy, we generate it, we keep it in our batteries. It gives us warmth, light, speed, information. - Our progress depends on it. - Depends on who? Well, energy, of course. You think Faraday and Tesla discovered their inventions by accident? I don't know. They sensed it. It revealed itself to them. It gave them knowledge, so they could recreate it. Our knowledge comes from it. So, you mean the energy is alive? Precisely. How could it not be? It's the only way to explain everything. - Who is he? - Bobot? Bobots are like shields. They protect us all. We build them, we program them, we connect them. We depend on them. They use electricity to protect the earth from the sun's dangerous explosions. This Bobot is quite special. Bobots have a golden power, but this one doesn't. - Interesting. - I don't get it. It's a mission, and you're part of it. What are you talking about? It's here somewhere. He is the boy of the prophecy. He is the one who will save us all from the evil Trashmen. That's right. Pages seven, forty, forty... Forty. Ten. Seven. - You have to save someone. - Save who from what? The Trashmen. They have turned off Earth's defense system. Now we are completely helpless. There will be a huge solar explosion, releasing plasma clouds. It will be the end of electricity and humanity. It will be the end of everything. We only have two days. At the most. Gotta get some rest. - Anything yet? - Be quiet! - He's not here. - I said, shut up! You, shut up! - Yes, he was here for sure. - Huh? But where did he go? - Check this out. - Is it his? - He drew this? - I don't know. It's too detailed for a kid to draw this. You said he was a photographer, right? - Yes, what about that? - Don't know. The cup he took looked just like that. You're quite the detective. It would make no sense for him to go to the astronomy station. So I'm thinking he went straight to Kalynivka with his grandma. So either he went to the bus station that way... Or he took a train, but I think it's too far. Maybe he took a shortcut through the warehouse. Let's go this way. Come on, detective! Hey! Help me! Please! I'm here! When I bought this car, it was a complete mess. Took me three years to fix it. Now look at this beauty. My pride and joy. Now meet Eleonor. Listen, maybe we should call his parents. What? Never mind. Let's go detective. Left door is open. Passenger door is open. Passenger door is open. Engine stalled. He needs an energy boost. No, not me! Please don't do it! I'm alive, you see. I'm okay, just stop. She cannot stop us. Let's go kid. No. We need to go now. - No. - Stop there. We have no time left. If we don't turn on the shield... You do realize what will happen? The world we live in, its energy... Computers will stop. Nuclear plants will explode. Planes will fall. Absolutely everything stops. It's the end. We need to help the girl. She's one of them, one of the Trashmen. The ones who turned off the shield. They want to destroy our world. Send humanity back to prehistoric times. She's with them. We don't have much time. We need to help her. Okay, fine. We'll get her some help. I promise. But you have to give me the cup. Time to go. Let's move it. Where are we going? Where should we go? Not sure which way. We will find the way with the help of the Chosen One. The prophecy states that the Chosen One will save mankind. Remember the writings. Twenty-nine, eight, five and four. It's no... I just need to remember where it is. Remember. We haven't seen a trophy or a kid around here. If we see anything suspicious, we'll let you know for sure. And by the way, I just wanted to report a theft. They stole a railcar from us today. And it has never happened to us before. - ¿Railcar? - Yes, the big old one. It's always one problem after another, you know? People aren't buying transformers. - Why not? - No one wants to buy them. We've been trying to sell electrical transformers to try and make some money. The transformers work perfectly fine. We had to sell them in pieces. For batteries? I mean, we didn't sell. Give them to me. Goddammit. Is this yours? It just fell out of your pocket. It's a battery. Did you sell out? - What do you mean? - It is just using you. - You are a slave to it. - What are you talking about? I just wanted to visit grandma, okay? I don't know what you're talking about. I have no idea. Huh... It is using people. It turns everyone into its personal slaves. - You mean the energy? - Yes, the energy. It will grow and develop. And then it will explode and destroy everything. Humans are disposable creatures to it. And it keeps getting stronger. First, there was electricity. And now there's nuclear and thermonuclear energy in the world. Do you understand what I mean? People are becoming more and more reliant on it. It's like a black hole that absorbs everything. That's why you turned off the shield, right? But if there's no energy, nuclear plants will explode and millions will die. You understand? People will die anyway. They destroy everything around them, including themselves. They don't care about anything. They couldn't care less about the universe or their own planet. - The Trashmen do. - I see. But these Trashmen... Who are they? We are lucky to have them because they know what's coming. That's why they fight the energy. They are protecting us. It's impossible. It's not right. Millions will die, you know? Even our own families. I don't have a family. I have no reception either. That's great. Check the kid's phone. All right. - It actually does. - Let me make a call. - To who? Svetla? - None of your business. Hello. Hey, Svetla. How are the kids behaving? I told you. I'm going to Kalynivka with Kostya. He needs some help. Who's Lena? Svetla, I didn't know you back then. No, we're not going to the city. Hold on, I got another call. Grandma? Gotta go. Someone is calling Kostya. Call you when I get back. Talk to you soon. Hello, no it's not Vadyk. This is Kostya, his camp counselor. Where is Vadyk? - A competition. - At a sports competition. Yes, wrestling competition. It's a boxing competition. That's right, boxing competition. He's taking photos for the event. He's a great photographer. You have a very talented boy. I sure will. Goodbye. You too. Goodbye. Are you crazy? Why are we stopping? You have parked the car. You have parked the car. You have parked the car. - What the hell? - I have no idea. You're the smart one. I'm just the athlete. Looks like a garbage truck. Valera, come check this out. - What is it? - Over here. Check this out. What does the cup look like? What exactly do you mean? It's just a cup? We got it at a wrestling competition two years ago. A man made this cup for us. His name is Stefan. He lives in a small shack nearby. Let's go find your friend Stefan then. He's not my friend. You're such a pain. I thought we were going to Kalynivka. We will go to Kalynivka later. We've got to see Stefan first. Passenger door is open. I'm coming, boss scout. We're here. EARTH CONNECTION Stefan, please don't. You're chocking me, man. - So has it started. - Yes, it has. - Here, we need your help. - Help who? - Her? - It's very important. Now, where is it? - Good afternoon. - Hey, there. Page eight, five, four, eight, nine, five. I thought you were older. - Please don't be scared. - I am not afraid. Ah! - What are you doing? - I'm saving her leg. You brought her right on time. I worked with patients for five years. And trust me, I've seen a lot. - So, you're a doctor? - No. I was a hospital nurse. First, in trauma. And then, I was asked to work in the psych ward. - Four. - I started working there and, a month later, he was sent there. And, after that, I moved to this place. And here I am. So he was in a psych ward? A lot of people were sent to psych wards. For anti-communism ideology, contacts with aliens... There was a woman next door who said she got pregnant from an alien. So what did the baby look like? Like a normal baby. What did you expect? The baby ended up in an orphanage, of course. - She was forced to get therapy. - Eight, nine. Our professor could have ended just like her, if it weren't for me. He used to write prophecies. I used to hide all of his writings to protect him. One day, they found them all. Oh, wow! They know about his prophecies, even the cup and Bobot. But they don't know about you, okay? - You know what I mean. - Yes. - But who are they? - The Trashmen. This is nonsense. Twenty-nine, eight, five, four. I cannot decipher them. Make sure she doesn't move her leg. Sure. Hold it tight. It's okay. Twenty-nine, eight, four. Six. This is the police. Open up. Where's Stefan? He went out. Who are you? Is there any problem? - Whose railcar is that? - I don't know. I have no idea. Tell Stefan to call me. - Take it. - This rope again? What's it for? So you won't get all of us in trouble. - Twenty-nine. - Sancho's rope again. Eight, five. And four. Yes, this is it! They went to the astronomy station. We have to get going right now. Time is ticking. Time is running out! I guess it's showtime. That's right. Perfect. Where is the capsule? I... I don't know, Where is the carrier? What carrier? Where is the carrier? Bobot? I think he went to the station. We had a deal, remember? The boy is mine. Ad namah ashnukna. You sold them too, like you did with me. Who cares? Nobody cares about you? - What about them? - It's none of your business. Get out of here. Now move it. Low charge. Switching to standby mode. Thanks for the energy boosts. The Red Way, 1.7. And now, for today's forecast. The temperatures are braking new records and the heat wave continues covering new territories across the world map. Today, the temperatures have risen to extreme temperatures. Who do you work for? I'm on my own, kid. Why was the girl saying you sold her? Who? The little weirdo? I mean, who needs her? The Trashmen were looking for her. And I found her in an orphanage. I was offered a reward. - Why would I say no? - What did you get? With these, I'll have a lifetime supply of energy. You're talking about batteries? What do you need them for? Listen, kid. I know that you're lying to me. Now, you tell me where the cup is. Take the cup! We shall meet again. We shall definitely meet again. Passenger door is open. - Oh, wow. - Huh. That's crazy. - The hell happened here? - Let's check it out. Door is open. - Are you cold? - My lucky jacket. Door is open. Door is open. Door is open. We're seriously going to use a tennis racket? I only have one. Door is open. Door is open. Let's try to do this quick, okay? That's his grandma. Looks like someone's scared. Huh, you okay? Stefan? It's all my fault. This is it. No. Without him, we're done. No! We must do something! We can't just give up like that, can we? At least do something! You're the professor. We can try something. We must find the energy and bring him back to life. And where are we going to find it? Garbage trucks. They collect the energy in garbage trucks. - We're getting closer. - To what exactly? A garbage truck. They have climate control systems. I don't really know how they do it, perhaps with magnets. But they can control the climate. Locally, of course. But it still means they're centuries ahead of us in their technological evolution. How do you know all this? I can be used as a living compass, you know? If my conditions get worse... What do I do now? What? Compass. Compass. Compass. Compass. Compass. Well... I think he's... ...doing okay. Are you the police? Let me. Stefan, it's me. Do you know who I am? Stefan, what happened here? Do you know? Who did this? Where? We must go and help them. - Help who? - The professor. And the boy. Wait. What boy? This one? That's him. He took the cup. We must go to the station. What the... Ah! What does this professor look like? Like that. Valera! Please be careful with the speed bump. The passenger door is open. The passenger door is open. The passenger door is open. Professor, are you all right? I can't breathe. Get away from me. Where's the boy? They killed the Bobot and took energy. But we've still got a chance. What Bobot? What energy? Where's the boy? If he's alive, he will come to the Bobot. Quick. Let's go. Come on. - We have no time. - Valera, give me the bat. The passenger door is open. Oh, relax. The passenger door is open. Ah! Ah! Ah! Now what? Ah! Ah! Ah! What the hell? No! Let's join this fight. Save the Chosen One. Ah! Ah! So, tell me something. Are they aliens? They arrived a long time ago. They need all the energy to evolve quickly. Otherwise, their hearts will be destroyed. Tell me, why did they try to kill me? They saw you on the book of prophecy. And only you can stop them. You are the chosen one. What makes them think I'm the Chosen One? You bring light, can't you see? Here. This belongs to you and the Bobot. I believe in both of you. But why did you first try to kill me and then save my life? Well... You're the first person who's ever treated me like a human. Yes, Svetla. I'll be there soon. You said we're taking things too seriously, now this? We should wait near the station. So the boy will come to the station? I'm not going to the station. Svetla, Kostya wants to go to the station. I mean, a gas station. Don't worry. I don't understand anything. They took away the book. What book? Where is the kid? - Who are you, anyway? - Who am I? I'm responsible for the kid we're looking for. You're acting all psycho, instead of telling us where he is. - Don't you dare! - Shut up, now! No ones dares call me a psycho! Look, can you see? There's just a few minutes left. - A bit longer, and we'll... - I said, shut up! Hello. Go on. Bring him back to life. How long will this take? Don't know. Usually, I kill them. Wow! It's back! - No, Svetla. - Valera. - What happened to him? - It's all good. - They're already here. - Who's already here? Those farmhands? No. They're the Trashmen. - They're going to the station. - Let's hurry. Why are they going so fast? - The dumpster's the other way. - The road is dangerous. Drive slowly. What the hell? No, honey, I wasn't talking to you. I'm on the road! I'll have to call you later, okay? - What is that? - The professor is not a psycho. - It was all in the book. - So what should we do now? What should we do? I think we should definitively go to the station. The road is not safe to drive on. Please take another route. Vadik! The road is not safe to drive on. Are you okay? Tell me you're alright. Yes. What the hell are you doing here? We're kind of saving the world. - The world? - Hey, what for? Don't touch him. - He's the Chosen One. - Chosen One? Hey, Chose One. Your grandma called. Thank you. Come on! Hurry up! - Are those dragon eggs? - Huh? What are you waiting for? Don't move from here. If Svetla calls, tell her I'm saving the world. Come on, we still got a lot to do. It's showtime? Should I turn on the shield? Then I should? "You have to do what you must." "Everything depends on you." "Goodbye, my friend." What do you mean? What should I do? Oh! Okay. So, now what? Sancho, thanks for the flashlight. The battery. I'll try this one. It's there. What's he doing? - He's going to get killed. - No, this was in the book. He's the Chosen One. Today, mankind got a second chance. But it's up to you how you will use it. The future only depends on what you do today. Never forget that. Never. Solar flare. BOBOT So the cables got all messed up and I ran to fix them. I connected them and jumped back to the platform. I plugged them and then the energy was back up. I literally got electrocuted. It was amazing. - Don't you believe me. - I do believe you. But in any case, you were probably just a little shocked. - And that's about it. - Just a little shocked? Subtitles by explosiveskull
