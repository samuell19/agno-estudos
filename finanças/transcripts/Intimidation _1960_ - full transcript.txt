A Nikkatsu production Intimidation produced by Ryoji Motegi. Based on the story by Kyo Takigawa screenplay by Osamu Kawase a two-bit hoodlum from Tokyo knew all about your illegal loans. Production design by Kazuhiko Chiba. That's why I gave him the details of your illegal loans. Starring. Nobuo Kaneko Mari Shiraki, Ko Nishimura Kojiro Kusanagi, Zenji Yamada Jun Hamamura, Yoko Kozono Nobuo Kawakami directed by koreyoshi Kurahara. Bank of Niigata service entrance who are you? How'd you get in? Just shook the back door and it opened. That was careless, pops. What do you want? Soliciting's strictly forbidden. If you're not here on business, please leave at once. Otherwise I'll call for help. I want to see him. The assistant manager? You know him? Know him? Yeah, I know him. He's at his farewell party. He's been promoted to the head office. Farewell party? As I mentioned earlier, our own Kyosuke Takita possesses a character that is both upright and conscientious. His track record and abilities fully justify his promotion to division chief at such a young age. His career is racing toward a dazzling future, like a Soviet rocket hurtling toward the moon. Of this we are all certain. Come now, Mr. Nakaike, not again. Leave that to us. Please return to the party. No way. It's my job to make sure you don't water down the sake. Are you serious? You're too old to be back here heating the sake. I was just joking. I just feel more comfortable back here. This one should be ready. Ouch! See what I mean? You're really pathetic. It's so annoying. What is? Isn't it obvious? Mr. Takita's almost on the board of directors. Aren't you even a little bitter? He married the president's daughter. Of course he'll be on the board. Where's your ambition? You and Takita have been good friends ever since you played together as little boys. He's almost a director, while you'll be a nobody forever. Not every bank employee can be a director. He has a university degree. I just went to junior high. All this was a foregone conclusion. But it's holding your sister back as well. What's that, madam? What about me? Shouldn't you be out there? Listening to how “upright and conscientious” Takita is? I don't need to hear that crap. Let him go to Niigata or wherever it is. Then my brother won't feel so inferior by comparison. And neither will I. Let's have a toast: Good riddance to Takita. Sake brings out the worst in you. Madam, I'll leave the rest to you. Running away? Wait! I'm the one most upset by your leaving. You really ran everything. I've just been a figurehead. Not at all. Your guidance saved my neck many times. Come now. But even if it's flattery, it's nice to hear. Hey, Nakaike, get yourself over here. Where have you been? Actually, sir, I was warming the sake. Warming the sake? General clerk isn't an easy job. Let's really drink up tonight. Thank you, Mr. Takita. Congratulations... Oh, stop it. Tonight we drink hard together, like in the old days. Allow me to return the favor, sir. Didn't he just say he wanted to drink like old friends? Don't be so self-effacing. Your lack of confidence is holding you back! Sir, Nakaike's always been a bit stiff. I hate to call him “slow, ” but I actually like that about him. Mr. Takita... Sir, he's really a great guy. Please take good care of him when I'm gone. I hope you appreciate Mr. Takita's sentiments and do your very best. A call for you. A Mr. Kumaki. Kumaki? Never heard of him. Say I left. Hey, ono. Yes? Do that favorite dance of yours. - I'll get out here. - Thanks for everything. I'd come in to say hello to your wife, but it's late. I'll see her tomorrow at the station. Good night. Mr. Takita. How could you put up with that? They made you sit before him like a servant. Where's your dignity? Don't say that. Kyosuke did his best for me. I ruined my own chances. How naive can you be? He played you for a fool. You've always been second fiddle. You just don't get it. Yukie, what's the point of getting so angry? You're right. He's leaving... After walking all over us. Just forget it. I can't. Aren't you even a bit ashamed? You were spineless and let him do whatever he wanted. He stole Kumiko from you. I was never a match for him... In school or with Kumiko. What do you mean? He used you to get to Kumiko and then used her to advance. Without her, he'd be like you - just another clerk. Don't you realize it could've been your celebration tonight? That's enough! Don't let madam hear you. Why not? I want to show the world who that calculating bastard really is! All right, I get it. Let's go home. You just don't understand! You've ruined us! You're too trusting! If it weren't for you... He might not have left me. Yukie, you mean... I'm leaving. I don't have all night. Wait. Just a little longer. Don't leave just yet. I have something to show you. Sit back down. You haven't heard the best part. My wife isn't the issue. That's all in the past. I don't care. - Then there's nothing to discuss. - Yes, there is. Think I'd come all the way from Tokyo empty-handed? What's all this about? I don't want to rush it, but I guess you can have a look. I'll be blunt: It's a detailed record of your illegal loans. Where'd you get this? You used counterfeit seals to make illegal loans. Your hypocrisy makes me sick. Weren't expecting this, eh? I'm sure this is your doing. And I've got the evidence. These are definitive proof. Seal makers keep receipts of all their orders. You got rid of the other evidence, but you forgot about these. That isn't like you. Just what do you want from me? Three million yen. That's the price. By 6:00 A.M. the day after tomorrow. If you're late, this goes in the mail to the cops. Impossible. I can't do it. Yes, you can. You've got loads of money right behind your desk at the bank. You're not suggesting... This is insane. My life will be ruined. It's ruined either way. “No lighthouse can shine on itself.”. Who'd expect an assistant bank manager to crack his own safe? It wouldn't even happen in a detective story. So I guess this is good-bye. Excuse me. Sorry I didn't hear you. We were packing. Father called earlier. He said you'll be on the board in three months. What's happened? You're so pale. I just drank a bit too much. It's nothing. I'll come to bed after I sober up a bit. “No lighthouse can shine on itself ”. Who'd expect an assistant bank manager to crack his own safe? It wouldn't even happen in a detective story. Hello? Takita speaking. It's me. Recognize the voice? It's k umaki. Uh, yes, good work today. Have you made up your mind? Six A.M., day after tomorrow. There must be no delay. Hello? Hello? Who was that? A guard at the bank. I'd asked him for a favor. It's good to work hard, but don't overdo it. It'll ruin your health. Another call? Don't answer. But dear... go inside. I'll be along soon. Hello? What, it's you? Yes. Please excuse my behavior earlier at the party. Well... I just wanted to invite you out tomorrow night. No, it won't take long. I can't afford much anyway, but I wanted to thank you for all you've done. I'd like us to drink as old friends... Hello? Hello? Yukie, you'll catch cold. Go on, then. Sleep it off. You're a spineless fool. I'm happy to take over the records, but I can't make sense of any of this. Is something the matter? No. That's the capital assessment for hokuriku construction. I see. We loaned them 20 million yen last December. It got them back on their feet. Now they're a cash cow. You were the only one who went to bat for them. I'll really feel helpless with you gone. Don't worry. I've delegated my duties to the relevant parties. Glad to hear that. I don't understand this stuff at all. When you go to the head office, please ask your father-in-law to look out for me. As you know, I'll be retiring soon. I will. Not again! Useless alarm bell! It's been going off for no reason since yesterday. The police will give us hell! What happened? Stop gawking and call the electrician. And call the police and apologize. Just an alarm malfunction. Sorry about last night. I'm getting old. Didn't drink that much, but my head's pounding. What did you want to see me about? I could use a little favor. Money? Please. This came up suddenly. I need three million yen by tomorrow. Three million? Please. Help me out. Why do you need so much so quickly? With a sum that large, I'm guessing it's complicated, but whatever it is, it's too much. I helped you when you needed it. Yeah, you came to my rescue. Your loan saved my company from bankruptcy. But in return I covered your losses from those illegal loans. I'd say we're even. Think about it: As of tomorrow you're out of here. Why should I lend three million to a stranger? Try to be realistic. Personal obligations have no place in business. You're about to become a director. Getting tangled up with hick construction bosses like me will just hold back your career. I won't be able to see you off tomorrow. Take care. Oh, almost forgot. A little farewell present. It's called a floral clock. It never goes wrong. Try to follow its example. Sorry, that was a little snide. See you. Did you have a visitor? A man asked me to give this to you. Said his name was Kumaki. A young man with sunglasses. What shall I do? He's waiting outside for an answer. “Don't forget: Byobudani at 6:00 A.M. tomorrow.”. That's odd. He was here just a minute ago. He called yesterday too. Listen... Sorry to call so late last night. I was just feeling nostalgic. - What's this about? I promised to treat you to dinner. I'm busy tonight. That's okay. Aizawa's sick, so I'm on night duty tonight. Is something wrong? No, nothing. So you're on night duty tonight? You got the short end of the stick. Bank of Niigata here you are. It's been years since we drank together like this. Relax. Don't worry about night duty. But it's already 9:30. It's all right. Have some more. You're with your boss. We'll make up some excuse. I guess you're right. No, I shouldn't. I really shouldn't. See you later. - Nakaike! Who cares about night duty? No one will notice as long as I'm back by dawn. Honestly, everyone does it. But that's a secret. What's wrong? Somewhere else you have to be? No. This area's changed completely. All this was wheat fields when we were kids. We used to race down the dirt paths. Yeah, I miss the old days. But no matter how hard I tried, I could never beat you at school or work or anything. But that's not surprising. You have far greater talents, of course. As for Kumiko... I was intimidated by her from the start. But even now... You still treat me as a friend. You know, I really... Yukie. Surprised? I was on my way to say good-bye. We were together a long time. It wouldn't be right not to say good-bye. Don't you agree? - You've been drinking. You must be relieved. You're free of me now... One less obstacle to your success. That's enough now. If you want to talk, let's go somewhere. You're not fooling me again. You fooled me for eight years. I can't do it. I can't be apart from you. Please don't leave me! Try to be reason... I should have had your baby. Then it would be easier to let go of you. Starting tomorrow we'll be total strangers, and nothing will be left of what we shared. Don't say that. This doesn't have to be the end. I know you'll never come back to me. I'll be back on business, and we can take our time. Who could that be now? Who is it? Who's there? Some drunken prankster! Who's there? Son of a bitch! At this time of night! Telephone emergency alarm I don't know how to open the safe. I swear. Only the manager, his assistant, and a few section chiefs know. Excuse me. Is that all you're taking? Just three million yen? Listen... Why not take this too? Seems you finally caught on! No point in keeping up this charade. Nakaike... Sorry for the nasty surprise. You see... I wanted to do something memorable before I left. I thought it could tighten security... To stage a mock break-in. So all this was just an act? Of course! Why would I rob my own bank? Go on now. Put the money back. Then untie nozaki and explain to him, all right? Mr. Takita. You kept me waiting. I assume you brought the money. Please try to understand. Just give me a week. So you didn't bring it? Then you'll face the consequences. I'm taking these to the post office. Just a week. I'll figure something out. Please wait! Fool! Think I'll fall for that? Mr. Kumaki, please wait! I beg you! Please! Let go! I despise men who don't keep their word! Wait! Stop right there! Stop. Don't move! I'll shoot. Stop or I'll shoot! I gave it to you unloaded, stupid idiot! You don't even know how to use it! Please help me! Help me, please! I'm begging you! I was wrong! I'm sorry! Mr. Takita! Please! I apologize... Dear, you should get some rest... What are you doing? I've been playing with fire all morning. That's awful. Are you still drunk? You want to change your clothes? - No. I have something to do at the bank. It was a security test. Takita did that? He's been worried about lax security and felt a break-in would teach us a lesson. The night-duty officer really screwed up. Who was it? Unbelievable! Acting as if nothing happened. I believe you've all heard by now. Actually... It would probably be better if Mr. Takita explained. Yesterday I played robber for a day. Some may say it was a cruel prank... But before I left here, I wanted to conduct an experiment. You see... I wanted to make sure this branch was worthy of our customers' valued deposits. Unfortunately, we scored a zero. If an amateur like me could break in so easily, would you deposit your precious savings here? I know I certainly wouldn't. It's no laughing matter. Of course, the branch manager bears some responsibility, and I too must take my share of the blame, but the harshest criticism... Must go to the night-duty officer. I won't mention his name now. Last night I invited him out for a drink. Much to my surprise... He agreed without hesitation. Around dawn I left him lying in the bar, oblivious to his duties, and broke into the bank. But I will give him this: When I broke in, he was already back at his post, sooner than I'd expected. As far as I'm concerned, that was his only saving grace. The bank opens soon, so I'll summarize very briefly the course of events. First I pointed a toy pistol at him, and then I... That damn fool Nakaike! This is outrageous! But sir, if we're assigning blame, we can't overlook ourselves. The other men on night duty do the same thing. It isn't just him. I'll take care of that. So you'll leave Nakaike alone, right? To be honest, I feel sorry for him. I didn't set out to ruin his career. I understand that. Come back later! May I have a moment? Sorry about that... But work comes before friendship. Don't be angry. I didn't intend to make you the sacrifice. I've asked the manager to go easy on you. There's someone here to see you. To see me? The man who was here two days ago. What was his name? Oh, yes - Kumaki. He's in the reception room. He asked me to give this to you. There must be some mistake. There's no one here. But there is. I'm here... in Kumaki's place. What are you... You really meant to rob the bank, didn't you? Don't be ridiculous. Stop this right now. Running away? Don't make wild accusations. Wild accusations? What if I have solid evidence? Don't shout. If that was a security test, why'd you leave the new bills in the safe? Because you know we record those serial numbers. Fool! That's not evidence. There's more. You took exactly three million yen. Just the amount you needed. You must be joking. You're saying I robbed the bank because I needed the money? That's right. You had to pay three million to save your career... To Kumaki. That's ridiculous! I'm busy. I have to go. Wait. Kyosuke... A two-bit hoodlum from Tokyo knew all about your illegal loans. Didn't that strike you as odd? I found out your mistress's pimp was shaking you down for money. I'd been watching your every move, hoping to expose your lies. That's why I gave him the details of your illegal loans. Look. I wrote this blackmail letter. I can write as many as I want. I still have three copies of the seal maker's receipts. You son of a bitch! You were out to trap me! I would've been satisfied just to watch you scramble for the money and bow and scrape to Kumaki. But you had to go and rob the bank just to save your career. That's why I let on that I recognized you: To stop you from doing something crazy. And in return you humiliated me, you piece of shit! You know... I could turn you in for murder. I followed you to byobudani this morning. I meant to step in and clear things up at the right moment. I rushed to get there, but I was too late. I feel sorry for poor Kumaki. I'll do whatever you ask. How much do you want? What? Or a promotion to section chief, division chief... Please, Nakaike. I'm begging you. Please don't tell anyone. Please! I've finally beat you! I've waited ten years for this. I've watched you strut arrogantly around the office... And thought of nothing but how I might crush you. Everyone insulted me. I warmed your sake in the back room while you got drunk with geisha girls. You bastard! You pretended we were friends, but deep down you mocked and despised me. You stole Kumiko and defiled Yukie. I'm sorry, Nakaike. I'll do anything to make amends. Just don't - - enough! Nakaike! Hello. This is Nakaike speaking. One cup of hot coffee, if you don't mind. Don't worry about that. Just charge it to the assistant manager. Oh, one more thing. What about the assistant manager's car to the station? Three o'clock? Good. The train leaves at 3:30. Make sure the car's on time. Go in good health. I won't be seeing you off. Better that way, no? You mean... This whole thing... You'll keep it a secret? Thank you. I'm so grateful. I'll be forever in your debt. Body found in byobudani Darling, father says our new house has a large garden. Did it plunge over the cliff? He says I should plant a rose garden. He's worried you'll have little time for me. After all, you'll have to be head of the bank when he retires. You're awful, just grunting like that. I won't overwork myself. Are you Mr. Takita? Miyazaki, from the bank's head office. I'll be escorting you to your destination. Ah... is that right? If you need anything, I'm in economy class. Thank you. What is it? - Nothing. He just reminds me of Nakaike. - Nakaike? He's doing the same job. I feel bad for him. He'll be stuck in that job forever. It's the only kind of work that type can handle. Mr. Takita? A man is waiting for you in economy class. For me? What was that fellow's name? Miyazaki. What a nuisance, summoning me like this. It's this way, sir. Please go ahead. That gentleman. Sit down. Figure out why I didn't see you off? From now on I'll be following you wherever you go. Just what are you up to? I was going to ask you the same thing. But let's get one thing straight: From now on, I hold the reins. Got that? What about the bank? I quit. I'll do better having you look after me. Go on. Sit down. Can I get a cigarette? And a light? Ifs still lit. Mr. Takita? Niigata police the end
