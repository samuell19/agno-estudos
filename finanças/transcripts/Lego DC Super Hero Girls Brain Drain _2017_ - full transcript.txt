Help! They're loonabricks! Hurry up, they'll be here soon. Stop right there, evildoers! How was that? - Commanding enough? - Perfect. I loved the way you said "Evildoers." If I were doing evil, I'd be scared stiff. Aw, thanks! You guys are the best. Let's grab a Krypton kale smoothie after this. Bumblebee? Katana? What are you two doing here? We heard there was a break-in. And... Great Hera, it's them? They're the thieves? How could our classmates from Superhero High be thieves? Principal Waller would have totally caught that in their application. We have the jewels, it's time to go. You were saying? Guys, this is so weird. What are you... We really need to have a talk with admissions. You couldn't have just pushed the door open? Glass doors aren't cheap, you know. - Hurry up, they're getting away. - Let's stick together. I'll drive. - There goes our smoothie time. - Seatbelts. Batgirl, Wonder Woman and I are pretty much indestructible. Besides, we can fly. Why are we even... - Point taken. - Yeah. Watch out. Why in the world would Bumblebee and Katana suddenly decide to become criminals? And why would they try and make a fast getaway in rush hour? Waste food much? Whoa, what's happening? Batmobile, eat your heart out. You should really be using your blinker. - Faster, they're gaining on us. - Not for long. Hi-ya! - Uh, Batgirl? - I see them. - Don't lose them. - I don't lose anything. - What about those earrings I loaned you? - Never lose a thing! Giant construction thing. Uh, that was close. Don't worry, I got this. Pardon us, citizen. Oh, man, you see the look on that guy's face? What are you guys doing? Huh? Argh! Uh, did anyone notice the "Do Not Enter" sign back there? - Nope. - Probably a dead end. That means they have nowhere to go. Okay, that was impressive. Yet at the same time... - Time to ditch. - Agreed. Batgirl? No, wait, I got this. You are so gonna be my partner in shop class. I can't see them. Supergirl? There, they're headed toward that alleyway. - Turn here. - Here? - No, the next one. - Okay, next time, you guys can fly. They must be inside, let's go. They could be hiding. Be careful. - - What was that? Sorry. Breakfast burrito. - Not that, I heard it too. - Uh-oh. - I vote, we go home now. - Seconded. Thirded. I don't feel so good. Uh-oh, Kryptomites. That would explain... Let's see if we can make these good girls bad. Uh, which good girls? I'm not there so I don't really know who you're referring to. I wasn't talking to you, specifically. I was just pontificating to myself, and... You know what? Never mind. Well, if we're supposed to be partners, we should pontificate together. - Like, about evil stuff. - Can we talk about this later? I have to go before I'm spotted. Spotted by whom? Again, I'm not there, I don't really... Whoa, that was the weirdest dream. Oh, I'm gonna be late! Huh, where is everybody? - - Oh! Good thing you slept in your clothes. Oh, mean Amazon. Go away. And now, to rope me a Supergirl. Good morning, sunshine. I need super beauty rest. Come on, ladies. We're going to be late. Morning people, blech! I heard that. Huh? What's that over there? What? I don't see anything. Huh, my mistake. Looking good, Diana. Ah! - Ready? - Ready. Let's do this thing. Today's the day. The Yearbook Club is going to release the results of the Most Likelies. "Most Likelies"? Is that another strange ritual like spin-the-bottle? Oh, I just heard about this. It's where people vote on who is most likely to do stuff in the future. Like, be president. Or open a Big Belly burger franchise. Oh, well, in that case, I think the most logical choice is Batgirl. Because she's so smart, right? You're so sweet. But I totally think it's gonna be you. I mean, Amazon Princess, heir to the power of the gods. Am I right or am I right? Well, maybe it will be me. What? It could be. I mean, look at my cousin. He's become the most popular superhero in the whole world. Eh. That's debatable. And I'm just as cool as he was when he was in high school. Also debatable. Well, whoever wins the award, let's make a promise right now to be supportive of each other. Deal. Oops, I've got her. Kind of funny how often that happens. - Right? - It's okay. But what's not okay is that. I know, right? At least spring for a hybrid in this day and age. Is that Principal Waller's car? Yup, I can tell by the license plate. Odd choice. I mean, it's kind of off-putting. Like she has some sort of wall that's forever up and no one can break through. Pretty sure that's not her intent. But how do you know? It could be a cry for help. We should talk to her. What happened to the amethyst? In the wrong hands, that could be a serious problem. Then why isn't it, like, kept in a locked room or something? Whoever did this is going to get detention for a year. My money's on Beast Boy. I mean, it's just sitting there, out in the open. At least it was. It makes the building look cool, okay? Seems like a pretty high-stakes sacrifice to make for aesthetics. ...Let's go, I heard from a source there's going to be a pop quiz today. What source? Good morning, class. - "Source", huh? - Well, it's a "pop" quiz and he is my pop. I'm handing back the pop quiz we had yesterday. - Yesterday? - I'm sorry to say that some of you didn't do as well as I'd hoped, despite his or her remarkable upbringing. A C-minus? But I've never gotten a C-minus in my life! That's like a bat-ugh. C-minus? That means... ♪ I beat you, I finally beat you ♪ And you wear meat shoes Okay, clearly I haven't really worked out the lyrics yet. But it looks like the race for the highest GPA is just about over, and you are looking at the winner. Whoo-hoo! I meant me, of course, in case you didn't get what I meant. Uh, I didn't really point at myself or anything, so... You stink. I don't even remember taking this. - Me neither. - Me neither. Jinx! Sorry, I just learned that one too. Hope we didn't miss a gym class pop quiz too. That's actually not a thing. Uh, creepy much? I've got a bad feeling about this. All right, you plastic-headed delinquents. It's time for you to exercise that teenage angst away with some physical activity. Let's play some super dodgeball. Hey, I'm on your team. Oh, after what you did yesterday? You can eat my team. You're out Batgirl, take a seat. Never mind, you're already in one. Oh, Hades. All right, Princess, take a seat. Come on! Uh, can we talk about this? Nicely done, Supergirl. All right, you bricks. Looks like you're ready for some sit-ups. How about 10... - - ...thousand. This has been such a weird day. A solid two on my top 10 list of weird days. What's number one? Facing Giganta after that chili cook-off? - Ugh. - Oh, yeah, that was a gas factory. But still, I wonder what's gotten into everyone. As if you don't know! - Know what? - How about the fact that you uploaded that embarrassing video of me on your Hero Hotline page! Without my permission! What? I don't even go on Hero Hotline. Too many ads. ♪ I'll be your hero ♪ You'll be my clown How is that any different from the other videos that you post of us? I spent my entire life, i.e., the past three months trying to make something viral. And little Miss Bat Ears over there posts one video of me and whammo! She gets all the credit. Whoa, look at that view count! Congratulations, Harley. You've reached cat video status. Whoa, I got like 2k more followers. That's it! This wrong must be righted. I challenge you to a... - Dance-off? - No, that wouldn't even be fair. I challenge you to a... Medusa head throwing contest? What? It's a thing. Um... No! I challenge you to a... Well, what? Well, I don't actually have anything, okay? I'm... I'm still thinking. Oh, I know! All right, you know the rules. Whoever eats the most in one minute wins. Are you ready? So there's really only one rule? You said "rules", so I was just... Wait, I thought you said this was a pie-eating contest. It is. These are pot pies. Pot pies are filled with vegetables and meat. Regular pies are filled with love and sugar. Which is terrible for your teeth. Aw, what's the matter? - Scared? - No. I just don't like to consume that many nitrates. And lima beans make me gassy. Oh, it's on, girl! I'm powering through this. Okay then. On your mark. Get set. Eat. That is a lot of microwaved gravy. Some of these are still frozen in the middle. Argh! Ten more seconds. Huh? She's inhuman! Time. Wow, seriously. That was impressive. And also gross. It just takes discipline and focus. Something that some people don't have. Yeah, but you know what I do possess? - What? - Timing. What is the meaning of this? Yeah. Great timing. Do you know how hard it is to get gravy out of your hair? Tell me about it. - Not as hard as pudding. - I expect more from you. Really? Even Harley? Actually, Harley, you're dismissed. - I am? - Gift horse, girl. I'm sorry, Principal Waller, it kind of escalated and... I think you still have a lima bean in your hair. I'm sorry. After the stunts you pulled yesterday, you'll need more than an "I'm sorry." Yesterday? Why does everyone keep talking about yesterday? Really? Vandalizing the Hero Ball Arena, releasing bats in the halls, and kicking my car onto the top of the school. Who, me? I would never do something like that. ...Lois Lane reporting live from Super Hero High School, where a few of the students took it upon themselves to wreak havoc throughout the campus. Supergirl created a little Kryptonian chaos as she made a super mess of the school's Hero Ball arena. It was a particularly dark night for the cleaning crew, who still haven't found all of the nocturnal nasties Batgirl let loose in the hall. Come on, who writes this stuff? And finally, the Amazon Princess shows off her athletic ability by kicking Principal Waller's car into the eye of the amethyst tower. Goal! The amethyst still remains missing as does any punishment for the crazed classmates. I'm Lois Lane, and clearly it's been a slow news day. Still sticking to the "I never do anything like that" shtick? That's clearly doctored. I can't hold a note that long. You have one chance to make things right. I want to know where the amethyst you stole yesterday is and I want to know now. But yesterday was Sunday, we weren't even in school. Don't play dumb with me, Ms. Gordon. Yesterday was Monday and today is Tuesday, the day you're expelled. No! Huh, I guess, I can hold a note that long. What just happened? This feels exactly like when I was forced to leave Krypton. The school has been like a second home to me. So much for becoming "Most likely to succeed." Without a high school diploma, the only thing we're most likely to succeed at is a dead-end job. Like politics. How could all three of us not remember an entire day? That's true. Something's as fishy as Poseidon's breath. And believe me, that's fishy, phew. You can smell underwater? I might know how we can get to the bottom of it. - How? - By analyzing the footage that I swiped from Principal Waller's office. To the Batgirl bunker. So it's less of a bunker and more of a gizmo shack. The footage isn't doctored. As for as I can tell, it really is us doing all of this. Cool! What's this one do? There, you see that glow? Oh, that's my new shampoo. Really adds some shine. Nothing adds that much shine. A diamond? A really big diamond. But how come we can't see it? The shampoo. Serious volume. That's so weird, I had this dream last night that Bumblebee and Katana were robbing a jewelry store and they had this weird look in their eyes and their hair was glowing too and we were all like, "Stop, evildoers!" And then we went on this chase and there was fighting and we ended up at a... Warehouse. - Yeah. Wait, how did you know that? And, why do villains always hang out in abandoned warehouses? We all had the same dream. But that's impossible. Unless it wasn't a dream at all. Whoever was controlling Katana and Bumblebee must have used the same diamond to control us. And make us steal the amethyst. But why make us do all the silly pranks? I don't know. Comedy? - Where are you going? - I'm going to check the dorms. To look for Bumblebee and Katana. Good idea. Katana hasn't returned those nun chucks she borrowed from me, like, eight months ago and... Hey, wait for me! I told my boss that you two were good. I told her we could count on you. But we got away with the diamonds. Barely. Lena Luthor is a girl of her word. And you two almost cost me that word. But we actually didn't, and that sentence didn't overly make sense. Well, then, where are the jewels? - Diamonds. - Ugh, whatever. Yes, where are they? - We hid them. - Ohh... Phew. - You hid them? - Yes. And that doesn't answer my question. What was the question again? Where are my jewels? - The diamonds? - Ugh, whatever. - Yes. - They're safe. - At? - My room. - So you hid stolen, magic jewels... - Diamonds. I know already, ugh. So you hid stolen, magic diamonds in your room? - Yeah. - At Super Hero High School. - Yeah. - Where there are a lot of, like, superheroes. Well, technically they're not full-blown superheroes yet. But the teachers are. Not all of them. Some are just cops or, like, business dudes. Anyway, get me those diamonds and bring them back here. Well, what are you waiting for? Well, it's, like, the middle of last period right now. We should probably wait about 10 minutes, so we get there right when the last bell rings. You know? Otherwise, we have to get tardy slips and... Fine, go in 10 minutes. This is going to be a long 10 minutes. That's weird, where is everybody? Almost perfect. Maybe Harley knows. Hey, Harley. Oh, it's you. Hold on a sec while I finish my project for art class. Wow, Harley, that's amazing. And here I thought you were holding a grudge against Batgirl for that embarrassing video she posted of you. Not helping. Uh, I don't know. It needs a little something. Oh, I got it. Ha! Perfect. That's A-plus material for sure. Harley, listen, this isn't my fault... Let me handle this. Harley, yesterday, we had a dream that Bumblebee and Katana robbed a jewelry store in Metropolis and they... "Rob"? Those two square pegs? Ha, you kidding me? Well, do you know where they were yesterday? Yesterday, they were... You know, I don't remember. But honestly, that's nothing new. I can barely remember what I was doing five minutes ago. Oh, you were smashing that bust you made of Batgirl. Anyway, for argument's sake let's say they did rob a store. Do either of them have a place where they stash things they don't want anyone to know about? Oh, for sure, follow me. Bumblebee thinks I don't know about her hiding spot. But really, could it be any more obvious? Ha. Yeah. So obvious. I mean, if she is going to hide something, it would be... Uh-oh. These aren't what you were looking for, were they? What are you guys doing in my room? Oh... Hi, Bumblebee. Do you happen to know why there are a bunch of stolen jewels in your super-secret safe that only you think is super-secret? You'll all find out soon enough. - Can you see her? - I can't even see you. And you're right in front of me. Actually I'm behind you. My point exactly. Supergirl, X-ray vision. Oh, good idea. There she is, she's headed for the window. Where's the window? Again, can't see anything. I got it. Wow, you should totally try out for the swim team. Supergirl, are you okay? That wasn't so bad. Come on, we have to go after her. Gross, did you eat yesterday's tuna in the caf today? Followed by a lot of goat cheese? - I did. - Harley, you still have that mini-jet? Sure, it's conveniently hovering right outside the window. Okay, thanks, bye! Batgirl, wait for us. Hey, that's my new jet. She better not scratch it. Come on, she's going to need our help. Oh, hey, Principal Waller, what brings you around the dorms? Hey, that looks just like... Uh-oh. All right, Harley, let's see what this thing can do. Okay, that's creepy. Got you! What? Look out! Uh, my bad. Don't worry, Batgirl, I've got her. Come on, Harley. There has to be something in here that can help. Well, this is definitely an emergency. Please enter your four-digit code thingy. Ugh, four digits, are you kidding me? Come on, Babs, it's Harley here. How hard could it be? Maybe it's her birthday? Code thingy inaccurate. Code thingy inaccurate. I have an IQ of 210 and I can't figure out Harley's four-digit code thingy? Come on. No. Wait. - H-A-H-A. - Turbo boost thingy initiated. Technically, those aren't even digits... Get out of the way. Out-of-control clown jet. Where's my Bat barf bag? For barf bag, please enter four-digit code thingy... Oh, shut it, dashboard Harley. Another uneventful day as a window washer. Where nothing out of the ordinary ever... Ehh... Huh? Batgirl, shut down the engine. Right. Hold on. Stupid airbag. Please enter your four-digit... Argh, come on. I can't hold it... Huh? Supergirl. I think I got it. - Z-Z-Z-Z. - Okay, I'm going back to stand-up. Much safer. Okay, Harley's code thingies made no sense. If it wasn't for that, I would have had Bumblebee for sure. And you wouldn't have endangered yourself and civilians in the process. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Thanks for helping out there. I really appreciate it. Mmm, it's okay. That's what friends are for. But it looks like we lost Bumblebee. Ugh, she was our only lead. What do we do now? Just retrace our steps from yesterday and find some clues as to who was controlling us and what they were up to. How are we going to do that? By accessing the GPS software that's embedded in each of our wrist communicators. Oh, man, why didn't we just start with that plan? Uh, we needed the action sequence. There, those dots indicate the two places we stopped yesterday. Where's the nearest stop? There, it looks like... Huh? That's weird. - What is it? - The Hero Ball Arena. Are you sure we came here? I guess so. What are you three doing back here? Lashina. Aplokoliptian fury. Powers, electric whips. Mad Harriet. Powers, energy claws. Artemiz. Powers, she's mean and she has a bow. That was weird. - Oh, is that... - The Furies. The Furies. Okay, we get it! You're a long way from Apokolips, ladies. And I use the term "ladies" very loosely. Like Lashina told you yesterday. We're not leaving until we become the best hero ball players this tiny mud ball you call a planet has ever seen. What an odd goal to aspire to. And if you want to come back for another one, we want a rematch. "Another one"? Another one, what? Another one, what? Can you believe the nerve of this girl, Artemiz? Let's raise the stakes. If we win, you have to go live on Apokolips. And we get to go to Super Hero High School. You guys would get a lot of detentions. Still not sure what "another one" is referring to. And if you lose? Artemiz, Mad Harriet and I will leave Earth. For good. Now, enough talking. Play or leave. Okay, if we're able to beat them, we'll be one step closer to getting "another one." And also knowing what's going on in general. What do you think, Wonder Woman? Uh, it's hero ball. This will be a breeze. - - WONDER WOMAN: By Hera. It'll be a breeze, huh? Oh, come on. Where are the girls that played for keeps yesterday? First to 400 wins. Uh, 25 to zero. So, I guess we're going to be here all day. We can do this. Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper. Whisper, whisper. No, that's nuts! Nuts, or brave? Go long, Wonder Woman. We won? We won! Here, you won it fair and square. If you ever want a rematch, you know where to find us. A mother box? Why would we need a mother box? Hopefully, the next set of coordinates will give us some idea of what's going on. - Where does it say we went? - Strange. It's coming from the waterfront. Oh, goodie! I've been meaning to test something out. So, the super hero girls came back to the arena? That's, like, weird. They wanted a rematch. Now we are 0-2. So, you let them win again? Well, we weren't sure if this was, like, another set up ruse type thing, or... Why would I send them back? They already got the mother box from you yesterday. Well, again, your directives weren't really clear. - So... - And how many of those mother box things do you guys carry around with you anyway? That information is classified. - No less than 2,000 at all times. - Okay, look, you ladies seem nice-ish. But I'm sending you to... Jersey... We've been to worse. - In the 80's. - How's that even possible? I have the Boom 2, with my cosine temporal fractal displacement coach and algorithmic reverter. Dude, I can't believe that player with the kneepads made that three-pointer while solving a 3D-cube puzzle and voting for that actor guy, all while watching the last episode of that sitcom and simultaneously being a guest on a talk show. And I so love friendship bracelets, man. No! - I can't pull off legwarmers. - At least make it the early '90s. Sorry, girls, enjoy the sitcoms and shoulder pads. You told us we'd be able to go to Super Hero High School once you took control of Earth. Yeah, it's true that I said that, but a lie that I meant it. Can't you just send us back to Apokolips? You mean the evil place with all the lovely, burning fire pits? At least the video games there won't be 8-bit! Actually, those 8-bit games are really making a comeback. Doesn't mean they still don't stink. At least we'll have hair metal. What the heck is hair metal? What about the roaring '20s instead of the '80s? Atlantic City was all the rage. Stop talking, Artemiz. - Ladies! - What? Bye. Man, it would be cool to see a hair metal band in their prime. Eh! So, your spaceship transforms into a boat? - Yeah. - You can fly. Why do you need a boat? Well, on that logic, - why do I need a spaceship? - Huh. - Interesting. - There! That's where it says we went yesterday. That doesn't look ominous at all. Why would we come to LexCorp? Uh, apparently you mean LameCorp. I'm going to bet that was me. Yup, definitely me. - Hello! - Shh. You'll alert whoever's here that we are too. - Isn't that the idea? - She's got a point. No. It was me. - Lena Luthor? - Lemme guess, she told you to stop by and make sure the amethyst is ready for transport. The amethyst? So, you have it? Duh, You brought it here yesterday, or don't you remember? Maybe you don't. I think she said there was some sort of amnesia side effect, but ironically I don't recall. Was it something I said? Uh, yes. You are right. She told us to take the amethyst to her. What's wrong with your voice? Ow! Not that I even felt that, but I'm trying to be more empathetic. Fine. Follow me. I have it strapped to my car. There it is. Tell her I'll rendezvous with her at the designated location. - We'll do that. - Totes. Hold on a second! No jewel? You're not being possessed? Only by the spirit of justice! Sorry, just seemed like the jig was up. - Agreed. - The jig was still down woman! So, it was you who used us to steal the amethyst - and get a mother box. - And make me fail my forensics exam! What? That's a felony in my book. You better tell us what's going on, or else... - Or else, what? - Or else, you'll be headed up the river! And I have no idea why that phrase means jail, but it does. Uh-oh, I won't be stopped that easily. Kryptomites, come to me! Oh, man, red and green ones? No wonder I feel angry and sick at the same time. What's the matter, Lena? Couldn't find any henchmen who wanted to be around you, so you manufactured some of your own? Yep, nail on the head, Buttgirl! They don't look so scary, kind of cute actually. ...I take it back, I take it back! Creepy little freaks! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Ah, there are too many of them. I've got this. Lena, she's getting away. Where's she gonna go? The only road out leads to the waterfront. My boat transforms too. Just sayin'. Huh? In the immortal words of the Kryptonian philosopher Keanu... Whoa... Hey, I'm just gonna sit this one out, okay? I'm feeling a little bit woozy. I'll go after Lena. Wonder Woman, you take care of Supergirl and big ugly over there. - Can you move? - No, but I can cheer you on. Yay, you! Catch me in that hunk of junk? Ha! Heat vision, heat vision. We're good at designing little button icons. Okay, Lena, how about this? I knew we shouldn't have added the arctic freeze feature to a boat. Ugh! - Any ideas? - Two. Isn't your favorite band called Opposite Direction? Yes. Their next album drops in like, two days. I am beyond excited. Do you love them too? No! Well, maybe, like, one song. That one they overplayed last summer. Oh, Your Kiss is My Rainbow? - No, not that one. - I Live for Your Butterfly Teardrop? - No. - My Heart Rides a Unicorn With You? - Definitely not. - I, Like, Think I, Like, Love You? - No. - Glitter Girl in My Backpack? - No. - Rockin' Love Boat Totes Magoats? - No. - He Gave Me His Digits? - No! - Whip of Love? That's the one. Anyway, their name... - Opposite Direction? - Yes, is my first idea... - And your second idea? - Red Kryptonite makes you angry, right? Good. Hold this. Oh, I'll hold this. Now, opposite direction. Sorry we can't stick around. You'll just have to do that for us. That is called a pun. I know what puns are! We have them in my language too, and they aren't any funnier in English. Oh, and maybe we should hit them again! Uh... Phew! Thanks, that was intense. Ha! Nowhere to go now, Luthor. Unless you're, like, a really strong swimmer. That's where you're wrong. We'll meet again, Batgirl, and next time, you'll join your friends in bowing before their new ruler. And that would be me, FYI. - She got away. - Don't worry. - We'll find her. - Hopefully, before she uses the amethyst for whatever evil plan she's concocted. I might have an idea about that. Whoever Lena is working for needed two things. Amethyst and a mother box. If put together correctly, they can create a huge dimensional gateway. How do villains always figure out this weird junk? - Gateway to where? - My guess is, they are using the mother box to circumvent the safeguards on the amethyst, so they can open up a gateway to Gemworld. - But why? - - His ears must have been ringing. - Ladies, it's Vice Principal Grodd. It seems we have made a mistake. Principal Waller has reviewed the videos, and now knows you were under some sort of mind control. She's willing to let you back in the school. With Principal Waller's help, we can round up the rest of the heroes, and stop Lena before it's too late. Finally, a break. So, are you ready to return to school? Yes, just in the nick of time too. We found out who stole the amethyst. - Besides you, you mean? - Right. What I meant to say is that we know who was mind-controlling us. Lena Luthor. We need to talk to Principal Waller right away. She's waiting for you. After you, ladies. So, Grodd, my dad tells me you play cribbage? - No. - Okay. I'm all out of small-talk cards to play. Uh, I don't think this is a pep-rally. Not for you, it isn't. Eclipso! I should have guessed you'd be behind this insanity. Lena could never come up with this idea on her own. Whatevs, I come up with lots of evil plans. I'd tell you about them, but they're... They're evil and secret. What's no secret is that you are trying to create a dimensional portal. But I'm guessing you didn't expect we'd be looking into our missing day. Honestly, I didn't think you were that smart. Behold! Uh... Yeah? A mind-control diamond. Lena's technology and my magic, a perfect combination. It gives us complete control on whoever we use it on, with the added benefit of giving the wearer short-term amnesia. See, I told you I was smart. Oh, man, - and clumsy. - I meant to do that. Soon, I'll use the mother box to circumvent the amethyst's safeguards, and with my army of mind-controlled Supers, I'll take my rightful place as the ruler of Gemworld. Not if we have anything to say about it. That's why you won't have anything to say, period. Attack! You never were a very good student, Wonder Woman. You always told me to aim higher, Coach Wildcat. You should have never come to this school, Supergirl. You're telling me, banana breath. No more monkeying around. - Say night-night. - As your principal, if you give up now, I won't give you detention. You can't give me detention, remember? I've been expelled. You can't win. The entire school is under our control, including its mutt of a mascot. Mutt? He's a pure breed, I'll have you know. Uh, this is bad. That's a good Krypto. - Nice pooch. - I can buy us a couple of seconds, but you have to come up with something. Krypto, here boy! - Fetch! - - Ha! Stupid mutt. - Pure breed, and he loves him a game of fetch. Supergirl, below us is the boom tube room. Yeah, so? This is hardly the time to be thinking about taking a trip out of... Oh! Quick, to the Batgirl bunker. Should we go after them? It doesn't matter, they're too late as it is. We must get the portal generator ready. Our homecoming is at hand! I can't believe she took control of Krypto. He's never harmed a fly. Well, except for that giant one that attacked Metropolis last week. But still, that was totally justified. Enough hiding, I say we take the fight to them. But how? We still don't know where Eclipso is going to open this dimensional portal. Well, that isn't exactly true. I was able to surreptitiously throw a tracker on Eclipso. - No way! - Wait. All I have to do is activate it and voila! Huh. That can't be right. - What? - My tracker's relaying coordinates, but coming from the moon. The moon, again? Are you kidding me? What are you doing now? I'm hacking a few satellites to point in the direction of the GPS signal from my tracker. Well, it seemed to be coming from a dark side, but there! Eclipso's palace? We destroyed that thing. It must have taken forever to reassemble. Well, reassembling is fun. I count at least 10 guard ships around their base. We'll need to be stealthy. They'll see us coming from miles away. - What we need to be is... Invisible. - Exactly. Do we have time for this? I mean, Eclipso, impending doom. Hold on to your ears, Batgirl. All will be revealed. - You know, like, literally. - An empty aircraft tanker, again. - I don't get it. - Of course! But, how do we even find... Oh! Ow! - Oops, watch your heads. - Still not getting it. All right! Now, this is super cool. How does it stay invisible? It uses advanced Amazon technology. - You have no idea, do you? - Not a clue. - Can it get us to the moon? - It should. It has all the powers of the gods. Including a brand new Hermes warp drive that should get us there in no time. - Now, seatbelts. - Safety first. I like it, Wonder Woman. Mummy! Mummy! I see three girls flying through the air, sitting on their butts. Shh... Mummy is texting. All right, everyone, hold on. I'm initiating the Hermes drive. And... We're here. Cool, even has a synthetic atmosphere bubble. Thank goodness. That space suit is totes uncomfortable. Have the guard ships spotted anything unusual? Nope. Looks like the superheroes aren't so smart after all. I actually said that earlier. Although you did kind of divulge the entire plan back there in the gym, so... That was before I knew they would escape. Why don't you just hypnotize them again? Because then they wouldn't have known how diabolical my plan is. I don't get why that is important. Because you're shortsighted. How is that... Wait... What? Soon, Gemworld will be mine. You mean "ours"? Oh, right. Ours. Can't wait to see the look on my brother Lex Luthor's face when he sees how supervillainy I am. - Now, how would you do that? - I don't know, vidchat? Can you vidchat from Gemworld? Well, Earth will be destroyed in the process, so your brother most likely won't be around much longer. - What? - Oh, I'm sorry. I misspoke. - Oh. - He definitely won't be around. He... He had a good run. Sure, whatever helps you cope. I was totes posthumously presumptuous. - What? - I said cool pop stickers are scrumptuous. Agreed. Although sometimes they can be too oily. What about the guards? Don't you think they'll notice three girls floating across the surface of the moon? Not to worry. When I use the cloaking field we won't be able to be detected by anything. Technological or otherwise. Why wouldn't you just have that on all the time? Hmm. Yeah. - Okay. - - Hold on. - I thought you said they can't see us. They can't. - What is going on? - Nothing on the radar. Ceasefire! Ceasefire! Nothing on the radar. Get back to your patrols. This new batch of Kryptomites needed to cook longer. - What was all that about? - Oh, uh, slight malfunction with my Kryptomites. I thought you said these creepy freaks were your most technologically advanced invention to date. Well, they are. It's just... Rome wasn't built in a day, okay? - What's Rome? - Some place that took a long time to build. Uh, but came out awesome. I'm sure. No matter. But what were your creep-totites reacting to? Kryptomites! And like I said, they had a slight malfunction, but it's been handled. Hmm. - What? - Deploy our hypnotized students into the catacombs. - But why? - Because apparently our superhero girls are not as dumb as we thought they were. I don't see any way in. Supergirl? Argh, this place is made with magic. My X-ray vision can't penetrate it. There! That must be an exhaust port. If I know space architecture like I think I do, I'm betting that leads to the center of the palace. Okay, girls, let's fly. Don't worry about me, I'll just be here, not able to fly. - Which way? - My super hearing is picking up - something to the left. - My Amazon instincts say we go right. That seems random. What if we were hanging upside down? Then right would be left. Lucky for both of you, my keen detective skills tell me that the center of the building is straight ahead. So, it's settled, we'll go right. Um, I think you mean left. We'll never get anywhere arguing. We all have communicators. Let's split up. Whoever finds it first, me, will radio the other two to join them. - Fine. - Agreed. Now we'll really see who is the most successful. Argh! Bumblebee, you've got to stop. You're being controlled. Fight it! It feels so good to be bad. - Huh? - Nowhere to go, Batgirl. There's always someplace to go. Sorry about that, Bee. I just ran into Bumblebee. Be careful. There might be more of our classmates out there. Thanks for the tip. Because you're my friend, I'll go easy on you. I'll give you no such quarter. I'd be disappointed if you did. You were a worthy adversary. Just floating around an empty hallway, in a super evil chick's scary palace on the moon. Totes normal again. Whoo-hoo! - Hey. Flash? Let me guess. Eclipso's got you seeing black. Well, that escalated quickly. So that's the way you want to play it, quick and easy? Let's see if you can outrun this. You think you're running the show? Enough with the silly puns already. Got to run. Need a flashlight? You may be super-fast, but I can fly. And FYI, those puns were awesome. Place it in the machine. Sheesh, thing looked a lot smaller way up on top of that building. ...Uh, Gail, can we get more guys on this? And don't forget to order that gift for my Aunt Trudy. It's time. Kryptomites, leave us. Victory is at hand. - Okay, so it's a tie. - Here we are. Supergirl, think you can unlock this door? I'm open to seeing what's behind door number one. Yeah, sorry. I was doing this pun thing with Flash. Never mind. Now, the mother box. With the push of this button, the age of Eclipso is set to begin. Knock! Knock! You troublesome teenagers. There's nothing you can do to stop me from destroying the Earth and ruling Gemworld. Don't you mean stop us from ruling Gemworld? Uh, that's what I meant. There's nothing you can do to stop us... - Thank you. - From ruling Gemworld. We'll see about that. Let's get 'em, girls. Don't bats like to spend their time upside down? I'm stuck. Normally I set my gun to five, but for you, I'll turn it up to 11. You don't have to do this, Lena. There's still time to do the right thing. This is the right thing for me. Give up now, Supergirl. You'll lose ground eventually. The only one losing ground today is you, Eclipso. I'm on fire with these puns. - My staff! - I'll take that. Let's see if there's an off button. That's enough playtime. Yes, I can feel it. My home world's magic is fueling my staff, increasing my power. - Did you know she could do that? - No clue. Nothing can stop me now. Nothing! Time to rid myself of these pesky rodents. Do you really think she'd share control of Gemworld with you? Ha! No, but I'm not stupid. Well, let's say you have book smarts. When she got comfortable, I was going to betray her and take control of the Earth. But she said that the Earth would be destroyed. Yeah, but I didn't know that when I made the deal. See, book smarts and street smarts are two different things. What do you know? Enough to get an agreement like that in writing. Well, I'm still taking her purple face down. You against Eclipso? And how would you accomplish that? With a mind control override device. I was going to take control of the Supers and defeat Eclipso once and for all. - Who's dumb now? - Holy ringer device. And thank you, Lasso of Truth. And your boots are supes gaudy. - How's it going over there? - About as good as you could expect. Oh, that bad, huh? Too scared to pick on someone your own size? No, not scared at all. No! A power draining pod. You can't win. Once the gateway is fully opened, I will be able to use my magic to transport my army of Supers to Gemworld. And take my rightful place as its ruler. There must be something we can do to stop her. We have to try. I can't lose my home, our school, to someone with seriously whacked hair. It is whack. It's no use. Your powers are being drained by Eclipso's magic in these pods. Is this how it feels like to be an ordinary human? - No offense, Batgirl. - It's cools. No way, Batgirl is not ordinary. In fact, she's the only one whose power can't be drained by these pods. You mean like that cool tongue-roll thing I can do? No, I mean your mind. That's right. These pods are controlled by Eclipso's magic. But the locking clamps aren't. You think you can, like, doohickey us out of these things? I'm hacking into Lena's computer system now. The only reason we've got here is by working together. Winning at hero ball, defeating the Kryptomites, fighting off the teachers. The only way we're most likely to succeed is by working together. - Together. - Together. - Ugh, give me a break - What about her? I got an idea. You know what I love about mean girls? - Huh? - They always end up miserable and alone. How cute! The girls think they are going to beat me with angry stares. How about some cold air instead? Your turn, Wonder Woman. With the rift's energies flowing into my staff, even you aren't strong enough to move me, Amazon. Who said anything about moving you? I'm just holding you in position. Whoa. No! Whoa! Whoa, what just happened? You ruined everything is what happened. Uh, girls. Look, the blast from Eclipso's scepter must have created a singularity. English or Kryptonian? Whatever... A black hole! We have to get out of here. Really, we're still doing this? You may have saved your friends, but you won't stop me from returning to my home. Mark my words, I'll be back! Wow, super original line there. I wasn't done. I was going to say, I'll be back, and when I return, I'll have my revenge! Still pretty cliche. This is an escape pod? I thought this was, like, your private bathroom. The palace, it's coming down. We have to go, now. I've got the amethyst. Split up and find our classmates, we'll meet back at the jet. Hmm... Do we really need to get Flash? I hate his little victory dances. - I'm joking. Sheesh. - Go. Is that the singularity ma-thingy? Yes, go, go, go... Wonder Woman! Oh, I see it. - We're not going to make it. - We'll make it. Batgirl's right. We're not going to make it. I said we're going to make it. No, I got this. We made it. I told you we'd make it. I love this song. - - Uh, what about them? We'll return them to school with the others. With Eclipso and Lena gone, we can retrieve their mind-control jewels and they'll think the last couple of days were just a bad dream. "A bad dream"! Girls, I've got an idea. Got ya! Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo. Aw. ♪ I'll be your hero ♪ You'll be my clown Hmm... Oh, is that it? Did we get it all? Yep, now when everyone wakes up they'll think it was just a bad dream. And we'll never get expelled. Yeah. - We did it. - You guys are the best. - I honestly love you guys. Just what do you three think you're doing? Uh, we're just... Looking forward to another day at school. Just glad to not be expelled. Whoops. Expelled? Strange. Last night I had a dream I expelled the three of you. Hmm. No matter. I'm just wondering why you three ladies are here before classes begin. Just hoping to get a jump on the day. And that's why you always get straight A's. Have a nice day, ladies. Why do you look so sad, Batgirl? It worked. She doesn't remember the last couple of days at all. I know, I'm happy for all of that. I'm just sad we weren't able to change the grade on my forensics quiz. No, seriously, that stinks. You-hoo. - Uh-oh. Oh, sugar, I can't believe it. Someone sent a video of me singing to an executive at Metropolis Records. They thought the non-auto-tuning sounded fresh. I mean, duh. Right? They want me to come in and cut a demo. - That's great, Harley. - Isn't it though? I mean, I don't even know who recorded the thing. Well, ta-ta. ♪ I'm gonna be famous I'm gonna be famous ♪ Well, all's well that ends well. Anyone seen my jet? There is one more thing. Huh, I did not expect that. Batgirl, what did you get? What about you, Supergirl? And you, Wonder Woman? But who won the "Most Likely to Succeed"? With friends like you, we all did. "Most Likely to Succeed"? Whoo-hoo! Ah! I'm the most likely to succeed. You guys are just dweebs. Okay, girls, I've got a surprise for you. How did you manage to get Opposite Direction to come to Super Hero High? Their manager owed my dad a favor. What? Rock and roll and the law cross paths, my friends. This is great, Batgirl. I mean, although I'm not a big fan, I'm very happy for you, Supergirl. Oh, you heard me, girl. I said Opposite Direction is performing here, today. Principal Waller, you're an Opposite Direction fan? Uh, well, uh, I commend their skill with pentatonic scales and their melodious infusion of R&B with classic pop, which doesn't feel too anhemitonic in tone. Yeah... Huh? Hello, Super Hero High. I'm Carmine, the window-washer guy. And I'm going to be your opening act. You guys ready for some comedy? Okay, uh, you know, I recently gave up my career as a window washer... Yeah, yeah, uh, I decided I'd try washing mirrors instead because it's something I always thought I could... See myself doing. You stink! Yeah, uh, my life is pretty much in the toilet. Okay, please welcome Opposite Direction. Yeah. All right, all right, thank you, thank you. We'd like to dedicate this first number to our very favorite super girl, uh, Supergirl. No way.

We're adrift between dimensions near your home world, which, by the way, will banish you again, or worse, once they've figured out you've returned. And I really have to go to the bathroom. Is there even a bathroom in this thing? No, and all is not lost. I've returned home with more than I left it. Uh, really? You were saying? Wait, there's a bathroom on that thing, right?
