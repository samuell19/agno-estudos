For you folks that came in late, this is a charity pool exhibition for the benefit of the children's home. Now we're gonna pass this collection jar around again, especially for you folks who had fish hooks in your pocket the last time. [tires screeching] Family Pool Room? [chuckling] What am I gonna play for, soap coupons? You can clear 4-500 in there. Yeah. Yeah, if you don't come on too strong with the shortstops. Here's 250... to flash. Anybody wanna poke a few? Sure, in a few minutes. Who's that? Will Addington. Who? Will Addington. The Baron. The Baron! What a thrill. [cheers and applause] Folks, big deal, all you gotta do is set 'em up. That's dominos, not pool. Why don't you show us some of your trick shots, son? A little later. Well, I don't play dominos. But... I'd like to see him make some of those shots in a game with me. A money game. Go ahead and play him, Will. Go earn him some manners. This is a charity, Will. It's a worthy cause. Yeah, play the big mouth. And then pop that sucker all the way down to his hub caps. [crowd laughing] Okay. $250. I didn't think those hands came with those work clothes. First one to eight games. Now, for those of you unfamiliar, the aim of nine-ball is to shoot in numerical order and the one that sinks the nine ball wins the game. However, if along the way, you can find a combination using the object ball to pocket the nine ball, you've got yourself an early game. Combination, nine in the corner. What's your name, kid? Billy Joe. You got a handle? Well, folks south of here call me the Cajun Kid. And you just came in for a friendly game in a family pool parlor, right? Well, isn't this friendly? [balls clanking] You got a fair stroke, kid. With a little homework on patterns... and a little more pool sense... you might've stayed in this game a little while longer. ♪♪ [balls clanking] [balls clanking] Oh yeah. [balls clanking] [crowd applauding] You couldn't play the shortstops, huh? I haven't shot for a half-hour. You're not gonna play my money. [balls clanking] Not against him. [crowd applauding] How much do you think that fancy stick's worth? More than you got, kid. I'll see you in the car. That's game number eight and match to Will Addington. My... pockets aren't empty yet, Baron. Let's try some eight-ball. Ring against your cue stick. Where'd you get this?

[chuckling] You act like I was just in here yesterday. Well, our Denver omelet's quite popular. Just coffee. Okay. Is this an accident or is this a visit? Harley was through here a few months ago, said you were back from Oregon. I've been back, eight years. This place must agree with you. Yeah, I get along real good with the owner. Yeah? Yeah. Me. How about that. Harley said you looked good. He should have said you looked great. You know, I hardly recognized you, Will... ... without a hangover. I just saw a wedding ring I gave you 21 years ago on a mouthy kid with a six-pack IQ. Rolled it down a pool table. Wanted me to play him for it. If his name is Billy Joe Stanley, you should have played him, Will. That boy's your son. Aw, what are you talking about? That punk? Wonder what he'd have called you? We got to talk, Dee. I'd say we've about covered it. When, 21 years ago? I'm busy, Will! [crickets chirping] Well, let's see, 18 years old... born June the 19th, Memphis, Tennessee, right here, six months to the day after you dusted out. He's had the chicken pox, the mumps, a broken jaw. You could have told me, Dee, I wasn't that far away. Well, I was. Do you know that you broke this eardrum with that last slap you gave me? Left me with a continual ringing in this ear for two years to remind me of all the benders and the wrecked cars and the calls from the deputies. And did you know when Frank came along that ringing just stopped. I got married again. Did Billy Joe get along all right with his step-father? Oh yeah. It was Oregon he didn't like. Oregon's all right, it's just the drizzling started and... I don't know. He was a tough kid to raise. Even tougher to know. Wonder why he never looked me up? 'Cause you were dead, Will. Blown all to heck in a Louisiana oil rig in an explosion. That's what I told him. That's why he calls himself the Cajun Kid. That takes care of Dad. I just didn't talk about you, Will. I just never got around to telling him that we had any kind of a wedding, just about the ring. ♪♪ [crickets chirping] Dee Dee, I turned a corner a while back, started going to church. And it didn't get struck by lightning? Not yet. You know, you do look healthier, Will. Where's your husband? Frank was killed out in Oregon, power line went down in a storm. Sorry. You know, he wasn't a bad father. Hey, Will... if you see our boy, would you tell him I miss him? ♪♪ Hey, you've seen a pool player here that calls himself the Cajun Kid? Do you mind telling me where, in your misspent youth, you learned how to play pool like that? I think it was at my mother's knee. Well, where else? She, uh... [whistling] Shortstop with a billiard room. Hold on there, ace. Arnie and I just took a vote. We decided you ain't nothing but a scum-of-the-earth hustler. Whoa, come on, cowboy. I also didn't tell you how good he is-- What did I tell these guys before we started playing? You said they'd have to have tapioca between their ears before they'd bet you money. You made me and Jim think you was lucky drunk and then you snuck us up to $50 a game. I got luckier, so what do you want? That depends on how you feel about your teeth? [whistling] What do ya think, Jack? We probably ought to give them their money back? Well, I think we oughta negotiate. [groaning] Come on, kid! Yeah, run! ♪♪ ♪♪ [laughing] [birds chirping] [train whistle blowing] ♪♪ Yeah. Baron. Am I privileged? You got a few minutes? Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Uh, Beamer said you used to hustle, right before you started playing tournaments. That's true. Why do you ask? I don't know. Everybody treats you like a royal honcho... a gentleman pool player. You're out there shucking the sharecroppers just like the rest of us. Well, something I'm not too proud of. I think the best thing I could say is it's behind me. He also said that you were a national nine-ball champ for about a year before you gave up pool completely. Hey, can we take a walk, get some coffee? Coffee shop's back that way. We'll get there. What was it like, being a champ, holding a title? Felt pretty good, for about ten minutes until I realized I had to defend it against guys like me. [bell tolling] I do have something I wanted to talk to you about. It may come as a blinding revelation. Okay, blind me. Your name is Addington. William Joseph Addington. Oh, wait a minute, my dad was blown-- Your mother and I were married 21 years ago. The date's on the back. I'm your father. ♪♪ [chuckling] All this time I thought I was a genuine bastard. Where the hell were you? I didn't know you were born, son. Your mother never told me. She must have really hated you. What'd you do to her anyway? I was a hardcore hustler-- booze, dope, women... the whole nine yards. Go get that coffee? [keys jangling] So what do you want from me? Just a little of your time. There's a few things we could catch up on. Oh, you're all ready to play daddy, huh? No, it's a little late for that. We're the same bloodline. Some of it's working for you, some working against you, and that I can help with. Like how? With a little coaching, I think you could be a better pool player than I ever was. Sounds kind of strange, doesn't it, me talking to you like a father? You being told you're the son of the Baron. Well, I tell you what... Mr. Father, I won't tell anybody if you don't. [whistle blowing] Couple of old shooters like us could really do something with this place. Now, what are we gonna do with a dilapidated old pool hall? Restore it, maybe even promote our own tournaments. Make it kind of a roost for other name players. ♪ And I know I'm never ♪ Gonna find another one ♪ To compare ♪ Harley, did you ever get seriously mad at your father, mad enough to hate him? Yep. I developed a real serious hate for him when I was 12 years old. What brought it on? He died on me. I really hated him for that. I figured if he loved me as much as I loved him, he'd have been more careful with his driving. But you got over it, right? Mostly. At least he taught me how to shoot pool. [balls clanking] So the oil barons and cocaine kings play nothing but four-handed pool. Why, up in Detroit, gun-and-girl teams play for as much as 50K. You hear what I'm saying, boy? That's $50,000. You're saying that my game is so far off I have to team up with some chick. No, I'm saying that you need a change of pace, kid. Until you know what you owe your father. Yeah, you...

And-- and this is Billy Joe Stanley. The Cajun Kid. [door creaking] Two private tables back there for money games, and they got six tables out here for tournaments. And... there's just no point in talking to you today, is there? See, my problem with doubles is usually my partner. Oh, come on, if anything, I'd wind up carrying you, cupcake. All I'm saying is that whenever we got into heavy traffic, my teammate was usually eating choke berries. I mean, I don't know what you'd stand up like under a hot lamp. Hey, Will, you still thinking about buying my place? Harley is, I'm not. Well... who is that? My father. I was just leaving. Hold on. I mean, I want to say something. I'd say you about covered it. No. What I wanna say is we never played eight-ball. Some other time, kid. Yeah, yeah, whenever. What are the stakes? 100. Make that a glass of grapefruit juice. Yeah, I think I can handle that. I guess you do look a little like me, here and there. Who looks like who? Sure didn't look like you at that pool table. You'd be surprised how much you look like me at that table. Same plusses, same minuses. What kind of minuses? Bridge, mostly mechanics. Seen your mom lately? Mm... Been a few months. I hadn't had much time since I've been travelling with Beamer, playing mostly in the boonies. You comfortable with that kind of life? Well, I don't wanna do it forever. Got a girlfriend? Nope. And I don't get too lonesome if that's what you mean. Look, what's the matter with my bridge? It's too short. I'll help you with that. If you're interested in trying a few tournaments. No thanks. I'm doing fine just like I am. Hustling's stealing, Billy, that's all you can make out of it. And you're still carrying the family name. I am not using your damn name; I'm making one of my own. Where, in backwater bars? Playing all the shortstops? Excuse me, I didn't know I stepped into a church. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Start over, huh? Sorry. Why'd you take me on today? [cash register dinging] I haven't been worth much since I blew off at you. I haven't either. We ought to make a serious attempt to get to know each other. Couldn't hurt, the way I've been playing pool. Well, after a few matches we'll know if you're cost-effective, and then we can bump up the incentive. 35% ain't much incentive when I've been keeping the whole roll. Well, uh, what happens when you lose, huh? I mean, you're playing with my funds, I do the pleading. Do I get to drive that? Well, if you can keep it between the ditches. Hey, BJ, we got ourselves a new business associate. Oh, you're really gonna keep little Miss Mary Contrary, huh? Well, we'll get a new wardrobe, fix her hairdo-- Oh, that's-- that's a good handle, you know? "Mary, Mary Quite Contrary." I like it. Get stuffed. You know, you can keep her in pigtails and have her ride into a pool hall on a tricycle, maybe suckin' her thumb. You wanna shoot some pool, partner, before you got too many words to eat? We're not partners yet. I'm gonna have a tryout at a tournament in Oak Ridge. The Baron's pickin' up expenses. Well, I think that's a dynamite idea. Yeah, that's the best thing you could be right now. Yeah, you could use a little coaching. Yeah, I thought you'd be ticked. Hey, table's on a plumb, we'll level it, right? Right. And maybe see you in Oak Ridge, huh? Come on, little girl, climb right in here. [car door closing] [engine revving] See ya. [tires screeching] ♪♪ [thundering] This a short cut to Oak Ridge? No, this is where we get in shape. What kind of shape? Tournament's gonna be double elimination from 9:00 in the morning 'til 3:00 the next morning. [Billy Joe laughing] You gonna try to get me ready in a day-and-a-half? Intensive training. ♪♪ Ooh. How often do you pay to get mugged? Just before every tournament. Well, you should have taken better care of yourself, you might have lasted longer. [chuckling] How come you never got married again? I was a long time getting over your mom. [thundering] If you liked her so much, how come you walked out on us? You can handle it. Oh, hot! How long we have to put up with this? 'Til we're totally tensed off. 'Til we shed all earthly woes. Shedding them fast, boss. You look like you're thinking about entering this tournament, too. I am. Trying to get back in the zone. The zone? The zone. The zone's a combination of what experience tells you to do, what your ego wants to do and what your nerve will let you do. This has got to help. ♪♪ Mmm, you set quite a pace, Baron. Let me know if it gets too rigorous. Will? You old pocket splitter, what are you doin'? Sam Crockett. How's your stroke? [chuckling] Like a plumber's, friend. When it works, it's beautiful. Sam, this is my boy, Billy Joe. He's headed for the Oak Ridge tournament. Well, if you can play half as good as your old man, you got a beeline route to fame and fortune. You know, he once almost owned this place. Yep, had the deed hanging right over the pool table. You're kidding. No, sirree. The old shark here, he let me off the hook. I got out losing 25,000. And mighty glad of it, too. Will, everything at the table, it's on the house. Oh no, Sam, you don't-- Will, everything. Thanks, Sam. That true? You let up on him? This hotel's been in his family for three generations, son. And that was reason to lose? I really wanted this place. But some stakes are just too precious to put on a lampshade. Maybe you don't know how to close out the key matches, Baron. No killer instinct. Maybe. But I sure get one when you talk sometimes. ♪♪ Hey, Will! By golly, it's gotta be a year. How you been? Oh, taking it easy, Doc. How you been? Oh, still pushing the rocks. Great to have you back. Doc the Pockett? Yeah. He's your first match. Remember to keep your bridge short like I showed you. [balls clanking] Yeah. Foul on Mr. Stanley. Ball in hand. You know, I almost bet on that kid 'cause he's the Baron's son. He sure gave away the match on that last shot. That a way, Josh. [crowd applauding] Hey, Mary Contrary. Well, well... If it ain't Bayou Billy. How's your acne? What kind of hustle are you working in that getup? Nothin' your game could handle. Ooh. Well, we'll have to play a match one of these days. What for? You name it? [crowd applauding] Like I said, I still don't think you're ready. A great tournament for side bets. Hello, BJ. You've been learning anything? I played pool 20 hours a day without dropping my cue. Yeah. Yeah, our little hot rod here just nipped a couple of guys for 1,800. That's some big stakes. A couple of noodles. You could've beat them. Well... If you know anybody who's dropping out of the tournament, would you let them know that I'm looking for a partner on a freeze-out match? What's the guarantee? $15,000... split three ways. Well, I got a match. Uh-huh. [chuckling] Will Addington just ran three racks. It's hard to believe this is his boy we're watching. He's got a ways to go. A long ways. [crowd laughing] Drinks are on me, sports fans. [women shouting] You still need a partner? Orson Redd just told me that Beamer has set the kids up in a freeze out against Walter Frost. The cocaine dealer? The same. Frosty doesn't like to lose, Will. I know. Those kids can beat him. Harley, I can't be worried about that. My own game is coming together. No reason I can't win this little tournament. I just told you what Billy's walking into and you're just gonna sit here? That boy only learns one way, Harley. [birds chirping] How long you think this match'll go? Well, like I said, it's a freeze out. You have to win by ten games. You see, after I put my $15,000 on top of Frosty's 15, nobody unscrews a stick until you put away the nine ball ten more times than they have. Well, you don't seem too worried. Would you like a picture of my Holson. Ah, you guys can take him. That is, if the kid's mind is right and he ain't regrettin'. You got a cold one up there? His mind's right. [sighing] ♪♪ Upstairs.

They're friends of mine. I would never have guessed. Teaser's friends. We might have a little trouble getting out of here. No window out the girl's room. Or the men's. We can always call the fire department. A last resort. With what? Aren't you a little warm, Mr. "Streamer"? Nope. We're eight games ahead. Nine. Nine. Your shot, Frosty. What's the plan? We lose. Did that in Oak Ridge. What are you trying to prove, boy? I think walking out on your dad is giving you a death wish. Damn table's not level! That's a sump hole! You want me to level it for you? Not yet. We'll know if this is level in a minute. I beg your pardon. Didn't mean to distract you. [whistling] [knocking] Federal agent, step aside. Walter Frost, is it?

Finally! Hey, uh, Harley said you made the quarter finals. Might have finished in the money. Yeah, I was right up to my speed, all right. What are you doing? I'm a fly fisherman.

We're gonna be passing some ponds down here, you oughta get the duck gun ready. Look, uh, I really blew that tournament for you, didn't I? Aw, not completely. Oak Ridge was all right. It gave me a good idea about restoring that old pool hall. Something I could put together for us. You got that kind of money? Nashville tournament's coming up. That's $50,000 first prize. Nashville is major league. You sure you're up to it after laying out so long? It hadn't been all that long. Besides, there's something I want to play for. Well, maybe I can win some money.

General Shelby must have bought this fuse box from Thomas Edison himself. Are we gonna have to rewire this whole place? If it were me, I'd bring in a demolition team. It would cost you 25,000 just to keep this place from being condemned. Look at those beams. The only reason this place hasn't fallen down is the termites are holding hands. Can this building be restored to look the way it did when it was built in 1860? Oh, it could look great if it were "teared" out clean and solid, but that's another 25,000. Let's get some written estimates. Okay, I'll get some subcontractors in. Hey there. Hi. Can I have a beer? Sure. Where's BJ? Practicing. Again? He was doing that yesterday. And the day before. He does 20 drills. "20 Tortures of the Baron," he calls 'em. Bet he could use a beer. Billy Joe don't need a beer. No distractions. He's trying to get ready for his Nashville tournament. What'd the contractor have to say? By the time we get through buying and fixing up, it's gonna cost almost $100,000. Too much. The only hope is that the seller will come to a more realistic price. The price is 40,000. That is realistic. Barney, how long can the termites hold hands? [chuckling] [train whistle blowing] Hey. Baron says I'm a distraction. Well, he may be right. You know, I owe you one. What for? 'Cause you really rocked me back on my heels the other night at Frosty's. I mean, when you put us nine games up, I almost kissed you. You almost what?

Otherwise, I... wouldn't mind sharing a few motel rooms with you, partner. There's Beamer. Oh wow, look at his car. [laughing] You look like you came through an Oklahoma hail storm, Beamer.

Catching a jet first thing in the morning, kid. I'm going to Nashville, Jack. I handed you $4,000 and you kiss me off? Gonna try some gentlemen's pool. Gentlemen's pool? That's a tournament where the hustlers come out of the bushes and turn their collar around so the pigeons won't know they fly so fast. What kind of match you gonna have in Houston? Another drug dealer? You wanna know about drugs, boy? You ask the almighty Baron how he jarred Archie Harrington. Be careful, Beamer. You don't know all the facts. I know that Archie was about to win a nine-ball match for $5,000 when His Royal Highness here dropped dope in Archie's drink. Wait, wait a minute! You trying to kill him?! I never jarred anybody! He knows what I'm talking about, kid. Gentlemen's pool... Don't know what you do with all this quiet. I haven't seen a car in a half-hour. People around here are content to stay in one place for awhile. It's enough to make you want to chew gum. Looks to me like a small case of pre-tournament jitters. [chuckling] [doorbell ringing] How early we leave for Nashville? Son! Hi, Mom. Your guest has arrived. Hello, Sarah. So good to have you. I declare time has hardly laid a hand on you. You're just as trim and prim as ever. I was about to say the same about you. Well, prim anyway. I'm gonna feed the other boarders in the kitchen and y'all can have a nice family dinner at your own sweet leisure. Good to have you here. Thank you. You've been here before? Yeah. But that's a long time ago. How long you been living here, Will? Six years. Billy Joe didn't tell you I was coming? Well, I thought it'd be a pleasant surprise. And it is. Funny, I'm the one I think could use a drink. You don't have a bottle squirreled away somewhere, I mean, for company? No, sorry. You look great, Dee. Have a seat. Well, I don't wanna break one of these heirlooms that looks like it came over on the Robert E. winch. Were, uh, the two of you together when you were here before? It was on our honeymoon. I thought people were supposed to have fun on their honeymoon. Oh... Our car broke down. We were on our way to New Orleans. You know something, I swear, Will, I just can't believe you've changed this much. And you, son, you look almost athletic. [chuckling] Have you beat your dad yet? No, he won't play me anymore. He's trying to win my fancy shooting stick, and his game is short. I can't tell who's hustling who. [laughing] And so we're, uh, running for the boat behind Frosty's pool hall and I slip and fall in the river with the handcuffs still on behind my back. I had to fish around for him. I thought he was gonna drown for sure. Where's Frosty and his gang? Chasing Beamer just like the Baron figures. How'd you figure that? Aggravating desperation calls for bodacious inspiration. [laughing] Didn't that Beamer used to back you some? For awhile, 'til I found out he was giving me 20% of the side bets and calling it 50. How about that? We got the same package. Small world. Yeah, too small. Hey, listen, get your daddy to tell you about the freeze out. Remember that time half the pool hall caught on fire and we couldn't get anybody out of there because nobody could get ten games ahead. Who were you playing? Was that Archie Harrington? No, I was playing Chuck Press. You know, I heard Archie got killed. Yeah, killed in a car wreck. It was bad. He could have cleared up something for me. Something Beamer told Billy about me. Oh, you mean when Archie got doped. That's 20 years ago. I was there. Did he just pass out in the middle of a game? No, it was a proper jar. It's usually amphetamines. It makes you overconfident and you try impossible shots. Yeah, and he got jarred just in the nick of time. What do you mean? Well, you were losing it. That 5,000 bucks bailed you out of a world of hurt. I didn't jar Archie! Well, you were pretty happy about all that money. Which means I was in on it, huh? Well, I didn't see you give the money back. I was drunk, I didn't know what I was doing! That's the same old excuse! If there's one thing you enjoy, it's believing the very worst about me! Mom, come on, we haven't had dessert yet. I'd say we've just about covered it. She came all the way from Memphis! This Archie Harrington thing is not that important to me. It is to her. She came in here looking for my bottle and I disappointed her. ♪♪ You're headed in the right direction! Go on! [birds chirping] I always look forward to this tournament. Good old Nashville. The soul of the old South. Capitol of southern sin, I hear. If you mean ladies with a more liberal point of view, you're right. It's a faster track. Zero to 70 in two beers. Hey, I hope you realize we're down here to win, not womanize. Girls have never affected my game. You've never played morning matches against this kind of competition. Women torque out your timing, son. Shake your speed. Next morning your stroke is wiggling like cranberry jelly in July. Are you saying no women? All I'm saying is if you want to win, have your fun afterwards. Is that why you left Mom? She torqued out your timing? [chuckling] Nah, I was usually right on my game with her around. Well, I'm sorry about the, uh, the other night. I should have let you known she was coming. That's all right. Just means we were after the same thing. [elevator dinging] I feel like practicing. Breakfast first. It's gonna be a long day. [elevator dinging] So Beamer takes off like a skulking jar but the Baron damn near drowned his own kid. [men laughing] Well, where's Beamer now? He showed up. Beamer always come out smelling like a rose. Oh. Here comes the defrosters. Where's your badge, Baron? Say, Baron, can I borrow your handcuffs? I wanna teach my wife how to swim. [laughing] He used to be a pool player before he got into law enforcement. Dixon, this is my boy, Billy Joe. This is Dixon Vance, the Christmas Bandit. Vance is the name, pool's the game.

Hey, how you doing, Harley? Vance rolled right over me. But I'm way ahead on my bets. It's just like the old days. You were my primary source of income. Hey, I thought I heard you. When did you get here? This morning. I watched all of Billy Joe's matches, and I watched one of yours. And I'm gonna see both of you tomorrow in the quarterfinals. Yeah, I play Burt Manning, and Dad has Dixon Vance. Look, uh, why don't I buy you a beer-- Why don't you buy me a beer? So you came down to see Billy Joe play, huh? Oh yeah. And to apologize. I just realized how bad I was at that dinner the other day. Oh, well, I went off a little fast on the draw myself, but, Dee, there's something you gotta know about me. I know who I am and what I am and I'm not what I was. Well, listen, you're dead wrong about one thing, Will. I always did believe in you. Trouble was there's just too much got in the way back then. How about some supper? All right. ♪♪ Did you see that? What? Well, either that button moved... or I believe I've had a touch too much.

He does play pool. Her husband is Burt Manning? [water running] Oh! Whoo! Welcome to tournament pool, kid. [sighing] I thought you might get tired of this game. Never. I enjoy my work. Hey now, don't you be too hard on him. He's a nice boy. Real nice. [balls clanking] [whistling] [crowd applauding] A run of four straight racks for Mr. Manning. Mr. Manning leads Mr. Stanley 7 games to zero. [crowd applauding] [crowd applauding] Oh... Here we go. Hey, Baron, that kid of yours looks like he's been in an all-night rodeo. You gonna shoot? [whistling] [crowd applauding] Foul, Mr. Stanley. [crowd applauding] [balls clanking] I just handed you a game, Dixon. Must be the Christmas spirit. Makes me generous. ♪♪ [balls clanking] [crowd applauding] You checking out? You'd be well-advised not to say too much to me. Look, I screwed up royally, I know. I can't play wet nurse, probation officer, and tournament pool all at the same time. You trying to say you would have beat Dixon Vance if I wouldn't have been here? Best pool I played in years. Why'd you unscrew your stick before the game was over with? You're off the bottle, kid. You're on your own. So what else is new?! I had more practice at that than anything else. Years of it. Look, I'm gonna make a comeback and you're not gonna stand in my way. You got beat by a better player. Now you're gonna walk, just like you did on Mom. Great Baron's gonna show me his back again. I made the quarter finals. You got me there. I was-- I was ready to win this whole thing for us. Will? I guess I could've picked a better time, but I think we got trouble. Barney's found another buyer for the billiard hall. How much are they offering for the pool hall, Barney? 33,000. Played me like a fiddle. What do ya mean? They slipped a building inspector in here. Now I have to sell. They gonna condemn this place? If it's not brought up to code. Is this the table where Joe Shelby slept off of, drunk? Yeah, this was my daddy's favorite table. Listen, there's a bar up the street I'm trying to buy. I need 15,000 now to nail it down and the rest by next Monday. If you guys can come up with that, I'll sell this place to you for the same price. 33 is a good price, Harley. We're gonna need more than that, Will. We're talking $50,000 after we buy the place. 25,000 just to keep them from dynamiting it. Uh, the Atlanta tournament's Thursday. It's about 25,000 in runner-up money and 50,000 for first. Go win yourself a pool hall. You got a fever, son. There'll be over 100 great players in that tournament. You've already beat 95% of them. It's a national nine-ball championship. Aggravating desperation calls for bodacious inspiration. I've got 5,000 cash, another 20,000 out in markers. I can come up with 7,000. No markers. 15,000 now, and the rest by next week. Three makes 15. Looks like we're going to Atlanta. Ladies and gentlemen, Atlanta and the Waverly Hotel proudly presents the finest pool players in America, in the National Nine-Ball Pocket Billiards Championship. [crowd applauding] Gentlemen, you may lag. Good luck. [crowd applauding] I think you had those balls running scared, Will. Those balls have got something I want. Next on table number two is Charles Pratt, the Rock Chugger from Wyoming, playing BJ Stanley, the Cajun Kid. [crowd applauding] Now, something that doesn't happen very often, ladies and gentlemen, Billy Joe is playing on the same table at which his father, the Baron, just won a decisive victory, in less than 45 minutes, I might add. [crowd applauding] Nothing to be ashamed of, Billy Joe. Not when you got beat by the defending champion. [phone ringing] Yeah, one more loss and I'm out. Hey, BJ? Telephone. Hello? Hi. Hey, Mom. Listen, I'm watching you on the cable. What are you guys trying to do? You trying to win that thing? [crowd applauding] Wait a minute, hold on. Five out of six straight racks and match to Will Addington. Did you hear that? Yeah, the Baron just took another one. I mean, he's kicking tail. Try and talk Mom into coming down. We could use the help, Dee. Well, I-- I guess I just wanna hear that from you, Will. I always did a lot better with you sweating for me. You know I never heard Billy Joe so excited or so proud. When can you be here? Tomorrow. Great. [crowd applauding] You got a match inside. Thank you. [crowd applauding] [crowd applauding] A run of six straight racks and match to Will Addington.

Houston. I won a cushy-cushy car. Oh God, you played so beautiful out there, Billy. I think you missed something. I lost at my other tournament.

You know what they play for up there in Detroit? 50- to 100,000 if you're talking about doubles. Are you? Not necessarily. But, you know, you do have three weeks before your next tournament. Well, I got to practice. I got people depending on me. Oh, that's nice, if you can depend on them. [phone ringing] Hello. Hold-- hold on. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What's wrong? That's Dad. Did he lose?

You gonna tell me that Dixon Vance wasn't jarred, Preacher? Well, the tournament committee here isn't familiar with Dixon's style, but you know and I know that he would never try a moon shot. Get out of here, Beamer! Yeah, why not? There's nothing more to say. My associates will even up the score. [groaning] [grunting] [clattering] He had it coming, kid, for what he done! You came just at the right time, son. They were gonna break my thumbs. I got in a couple of licks, but they could have left sooner. You jarred Dixon. That's why they did this. I didn't have to. I was in the zone. I was hoping it was booze that made him shoot wild, but it was dope. Hey, I didn't-- You righteous phony! Your pool pit just went in the toilet, and so did your gentleman's pool. You know, if-- if hustling's stealing, you got away with grand theft. But, Billy Joe, you might not know all the-- I know all I have to know. He jarred Vance! I didn't dope Vance. You believe that, don't you? Yes. Mary Beth... we're not gonna make Knoxville tonight if we have to stop and pay speeding tickets. What's in Knoxville? Tobacco tycoon and his mistress. They get off on pool. [chuckling] Guess that means I'll be playing doubles from here on out, huh? Ah, the money's deeper at that end, kid. We're gonna play Ames. Ames in Detroit, BJ. And then New York. Then in Tennessee. Yeah, sounds great. Well, what's great is you kids don't have to lay down the lamb, and you just walk in there saying "gosh" and "gee whiz" and "golly" and you'll go through them like milk of magnesia. In a few months, you'll be able to buy that billiard parlor for your daddy. You are kidding. I hope that place burns to the ground. Hey, you don't wanna talk that way. Why not? Hating your dad ain't healthy. It's double-edged, cuts both ways. Take it from one who's done some cutting. Thought you and your dad got along. Yeah, before he went into the joint. Well, he was just there a few years, you said. Six. He got paroled, we had a coming-out party-- balloons, banners, cake, the whole family, all seven of us. Yeah? I guess seeing all the people who loved him and needed him gave Dad a crying a fit. He balled for a half-hour, all of us hugging him. Then he put us all to bed, went out, tried to rob a liquor store. Got put away again. Mary Beth, is that a service station up ahead? Pull off there, will ya? I need a phone to lay down some bets. If you can find the brakes, that is. [bell dinging] I got news for you, kid. I love you. I don't get it. Our friend Beamer put all his money on the Baron. [door opening] Vance still at the hospital? No, I brought him back. He's up in his room taking a rest. They drew every fluid he owns. When we gonna know something? Well, it shouldn't take long. The hospital lab has this number. The only thing about this, Will, nobody else asked for a blood test. For all we know, this was his drinking. And that's Vance. And the way you were playing, I'd of probably had a few drinks myself. He was doped. I wouldn't be too sure about that, Will, he-- Tournament desk, Matthew Brady speaking. Yep, that's right. Mm-hmm. No sign of any mind-altering drugs. Except a trace of alcohol and a slightly high blood sugar. That's from all those Christmas carols he's been singing. [laughing] All right, Will. Go buy yourself that billiard hall. What are you doing? I beat him once, I'll beat him again. Oh, come on, Will, now what kind of pill could get by 42 different lab tests? It's called a Patagonia Blue. A heavy dose of pure adrenalin, the kind your body makes. Beamer put it in Vance's drink. I guess that's why it didn't turn up in the tests. How do you know it was Beamer? I was with him when he bought the pills in Houston. Then Beamer bet on me. Made a bundle. He knew a jar job on Vance would put Billy back in his stable.
