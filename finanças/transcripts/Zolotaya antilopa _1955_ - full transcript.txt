Gold! Money! Money! Get her! Go! Go! Get your Antelope. I'll pick up everything. Four, five, six. Don't be afraid. Come on! I'll hide you. Don't be scared. Follow me! Come on! Come on! Hide! Quick! The Golden Antelope has just been here! Tell me where she went! Raja! You are so great! The Antelope went that way. Why do her traces stop here? You are trying to trick me, boy. Give me an order and I'll cut his head off. First go and check! If you lied to me, boy, I must throw you to the leopards. The boy has told you the truth! This is what I found in the bushes. I'm tough, but always just. And for your honesty, you shall be given a very special award. Give me those golden coins! Boy, for your honesty, I am going to give you your life. Take the leopards away! Thank you, little brother. Whenever you need my help, come to me. Where shall I find you? I live deep in the jungle, past the old town, near the Humpback Mountain, in a place where the green bamboo whispers. I live where the wild plums grow. Where six little bears squeal with joy. When a leaf falls down from a tree, the tigers come out to see it happen. Come to me, little brother. I shall never forsake you. Nor shall I. Hold her! Hold her tight, boy! ? Get away! Oh! Go! Go, you stupid mule! Go! Why did you let her go? You frightened me! You're lying! Tell me where she is. I don't know. - You're lying! You hugged each other like good pals. Tell me or else. I've got nothing to lose. I'm an orphan. - Well, well, an orphan. Poor little orphan. Tell me where the antelope lives. Tell me, and I will give you a shiny coin. I don't want a coin. You want more than one? I'll give you more. Many more. I do not need your coins. Not any! So, you think the antelope can give you more? Tell me! Where is she? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! ?! Tell me! Where is she? Stop! Tell me! Come back! Tell me! There's no use! No use! Now I've got you. ?! I'll tell the Raja! Every Raja has something magical. The Raja of the North has a famed wooden horse that flies swiftly through the air! The Raja of the South has a mystical wife who can turn herself into a flitting bird. I've seen all this a number of times. Be gone! I'm so bored! The Raja of the West has a magic wand that can create a feast. And I've got absolutely nothing. Be gone! Today the Golden Antelope escaped from me. Oh! Come here! Come! Come closer! Come closer! Don't be afraid! I only wish to see the coins that you collected from the Golden Antelope. All of them! What if they are counterfeits? ?h! Let me check them. Let me see. I'll compare them to the ones in the treasury. We'll know in a moment. Let me check them. I only want to compare your coins to mine. I only want to compare your coins to mine. I only want to compare your coins to mine. I'm verry happy to say that your coins are real. Raja! You have dropped my coins in the chest with your own! Dear, dear! What have I done? Now, how will I ever tell your coins from mine? Raja, please! Give back my gold! Oh, but what if I make a mistake and give you back coins that are mine? I cannot give my coins to anyone. Not anyone. Your Highness, please! Unfortunetely, my money is more worthy than my people. My money is real, and my people are phony. You swear your loyalty, but you can't get me the Golden Antelope. Your Higness, this is exactly what I was going to tell you. A boy from the village knows just where to find her! He can find the Golden Antelope? Bring the boy to me! The Raja has ordered you to his castle at once! I have done nothing wrong. Do your job. Get away! Get away! Go on! Go on! Go back to the jungle. Get away! Go back to the jungle. Guards! Arrest the boy! You would still do this to me? I saved your life! No, no, no. Don't be foolish. I couldn't be scared of this striped cat. Take him to the Raja! Immediately! Follow me! So, you attacked my servant, boy. You ripped his clothes and caused great damage to him. You'll be punished for this. He was attacked by a tiger. I saved his life. Liar! He attacked me like a tiger! Sire, let me cut off his head. Not this time. Boy, you must pay a fine for all your crimes. Ten golden coins. Gold for me? Fool. All golden coins come to the Raja. You've already received what was yours, have you not? Oh, great Raja, I do not have ten coins. Bring them to me by tomorrow's sunrise, or tomorrow morning you may say goodbye to your head. Now go! Follow him! When he goes to the jungle to seek the help of the Antelope, we will learn where she lives. Snake! Don't eat the birds. Have some milk. Here. Thank you, little brother. Why have you come so deep into the jungle? I am looking for the Golden Antelope. Follow me! Do not cry, little ones. I'll help you out! There. Run! Thank you, little brother. What are you looking for so deep in the jungle? I am looking for the Golden Antelope. Let me take you there. Goodbye. I must leave you now, brother. The old town. The Antelope told me. Thank you, little brother. But tell me, why have you come so deep into the jungle? I am looking for the Golden Antelope. climb on my back. That's it. Now I will take you to her home. Oh, the Humpbacked Mountain! There it is! My journey ends here. You must continue alone, little brother. Green bamboo! Six little bears! A wild plum tree! Tigers. Do not harm him. This is my friend. At last! I'm so happy! Why have you come, little brother? The Raja said he will cut off my head if I do not bring him ten golden coins by sunrise tomorrow. Take them! Thank you! Now take this bamboo and make a pipe from it. If ever you need me, just blow the pipe three times and I will appear. Three times? Perfect! - I must leave you now. - You will never arrive on time. Get on my back and I will take you there myself. - Not here? - Not here. - Not here? - Not here. - He is here! - He is here! - You? - Oh great Raja, I have brought you all that you asked of me. I know who gave you these ten golden coins, boy. Tell me where to find the Golden Antelope! Tell me! I cannot! Your Highness, let me cut off his head! Hold your sword! Boy, listen now. I will give you just three minutes to tell me where she is. If you do not tell me by the time the last grain of sand falls down into the glass, your head will be cut off. You are a Raja, but you know nothing of loyalty and friendship. I will make you a minister. Or, you can be my son! Or my father, or anything your little heart desires, just tell me shere she is. - Tell me! - I won't! I won't tell you. Tell me before it's too late! I'll never tell you. - You will not tell me? - Never! Then cut off his head! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! The boy, he has a magic pipe! Blow into it three times, and the antelope will appear! - No! No! Give it back! - No! Did you call me, little brother? No! Run away! It's a trap! Run! Wait! If you run away, I will be forced to cut the boy's head off. What do you want from me? Gold! If you let the boy go, I will give you the gold. Let the boy go. Guards! Get her! Go, little brother. I'll be all right. I will not leave you. Pah! Get that boy away from her! - Don't you worry about me. - Don't go! How much gold do you desire? All of it. But what if that is too much? Stupid creature! You can never give me too much gold! As you wish. But remember, if you stop and tell me you have enough, all your gold will turn to clay, like broken chips of old and useless pottery. Gold! Mine! Get back! It's all mine! All mine! Gold! It's all mine! Run, here! Stop! Wait! You cannot leave! I don't have enough! Yes! More! More gold! Heavy, heavy gold. I can't breathe! Help! Enough! Help! Help! You are on your own! I will find a Raja who is not afraid to die from too much gold! Come, little brother. Let us go home. Yes, let's go.
