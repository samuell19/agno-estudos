Are you going to tell your friends that you're just a [INAUDIBLE]? Shut your face or I'll send you back to the stage, sweetheart. A Frankie Dio, you'll never be. At night, you got a headache. In the morning, you're too tired. If I ask for a matinee, you send me to the movies. I get pushy, and you become a hard case. Only there's nothing hard about you. Huh, baby, except your elbow. And I ain't the elbow type! [CHUCKLES] Why, you! Listen, you straighten out, or I'll blow some other guy. Go ahead. Go ahead! Try it! I'll put you in a wheelchair for life! You and him both! Ah. Excuse me. Excuse her. She's just a broad, like all the rest of them. Trying to screw me up. But me, I'm like you. [CHUCKLES] No, I use them. Bowl 'em. Wear them down maybe. But marriage? Ha! Not a chance. So forget it! Eat you heart out, you cheap bum. [UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Ciao, Tony. Ciao. Tony, Ciao. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] See who's here! Hey, Tony. Hi, Tony! Hey, Tony, where you buy your suits these days? [LAUGHS] Hi, Tony, up yours. Hiya, Tony. Hi. Hi! I know a little job that you can pull. Where? A bar. They sell cigarettes and lottery tickets. Big deal. Who else is in on it? Sandrino and Baron. How much and when? Tonight. Forget it. At least 300,000 Lyra apiece. No risk guaranteed. Now look, first it's child's play. Second, I don't like the company. And third, I'm busy tonight. Don't you read the newspaper? I've got to be at the airport at 8:30. Why? You got to carry his bags for the guy, huh? Look! You were born a worm and you're going to die a worm. But me, all I got to do is show myself, huh, and that's enough, 'cause I don't have your clown's face. Wish you'd get over this romance. [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [CROWD CLAMORING] [NON-ENGLISH], Mr. Diomedes? [NON-ENGLISH] Who's going to be here to meet you? How long do you plan to stay here, Mr. Diomedes? You have got familia in here, don't you? Don't you want to say something? Please stay here. Don't get away, Mr. Diomedes. Hey, Give us a smile! [SHATTERS] Wait a minute! Frankie. Lawyer. No. I'd like Joe to light it. I'm sorry, Frankie. One of these days I will come to see you. No, no, no, it's just that the clinic takes up all my time. Try to understand. Look, Frankie, I'm a foreigner here. You're all over the newspapers, and the publicity is-- Well, what I-- you're my brother, Frankie. Try and put yourself in my position. I'm a doctor. I have a family. Sure. Yeah. Ah, don't worry about it. Ciao. [INTRIGUING MUSIC] [MOTORCYCLE REVS] Delivery boys got to use the service entrance. Wise guy, huh? Hey, I'm with Frankie. He ain't said nothing to me. Anyway, this is a private club. Oh, yeah? Well, try and stop me, schmuck. Hey, you schmuck, unhand this bike. Sure, kid. Ah! [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Frankie, what a surprise. No one said you were coming. That's right. Would you like to see the books? No. Would you like something to drink? No. Would you like a few girls? You better clean out the place. The police will be here any minute. The cops? What are you, joking? Hey, we own the police. Are you sure? I'm going to call them myself. [BEEP] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Now listen, and listen close, I'm only going to say it one time. There's an illegal gambling operation in a white Villa at the end of the Alley Magnolia. And if you hurry, you may just find Frankie Dio there. [CROWD CLAMORING] [SIREN BLARING] Wait a minute. I save Frankie Dio, I'm made for life. Get out of my way! Hey, where were you? Frankie, it's me. Cops! Come on, hurry up, Frankie. Come on, I'll clean out the place. Who are you? Look, Frankie, you who don't know me, but I'm a guy-- You're a kid who don't know how to mind his own business. Oh no. No, Frankie, you don't understand. You don't understand. Don't let him get out. [NON-ENGLISH] Don't anybody move. Take off your belt and shoelaces. Boots, no laces. Leather, genuine leather. Name, place of birth. Tony Breda, born in Milan, 8/13/46. But I was raised in Hoboken. I'm not one of them. That's a private room. Over there. You're kidding. No, he ain't. He's serious. He let himself be arrested just sitting there? Come on, Frankie's too smart. He's got to be up to something. And that worries me. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello. Hello! [CRACKING] [TENSE MUSIC] Who's there? Were you worried about me? Here I am, Joe. What do you mean, Frankie? What have I done? We both know. Normally I wouldn't waste my time, Joe, but you are something special. You're a special kind of disappointment, Joe. So I'm going to take care of you myself. No, please. Don't. Let me explain. Don't! So long, Joe. [YELLS] [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] Hi. I'm Tony Breda. It's a nice name. Hold on to it. Let's go. Hey. Hey. Hey, Piggy, say hello. Salud. Hey, baby. Is it true that they pinched Frankie Dio? He was with me. Him and me, we're like that. You don't say. Describe him, baby. He has a very long nose. [GIGGLES] He's being suggestive. [LIVELY MUSIC] You know, the ass is sensitive anatomy. Several report that last night, several hours after the arrest of international crime boss Frankie Dio, the body of his alleged number one man in Europe, Joe Sciti, was found in the courtyard of his apartment. According to the coroner's report, Sciti was killed about midnight, and his death was attributed to a plunge from his terrace six stories above. Police are trying to determine whether it was an accident, suicide, or murder. Local investigators say they are not excluding any theories for the moment. Meanwhile, Dio's lawyer, Paolo Massara, has petitioned the court to grant his client a provisional release. He told newspapermen that he had every reason to believe that his request would be granted. Emphasizing the fact that Dio, though many times accused of murder, has yet to be convicted. Massara added that he knew nothing about the reported attitude of tenants in the building where Sciti he died. That they refused to speak of what happened out of fear for their lives. Play ball! [WHISTLE BLOWS] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Oh man, are you smart. Come on, Frankie, I seen everything. I know exactly what happened. You get yourself pinched, you sneak out, you do what you have to do, and you sneak back in. [INAUDIBLE] I ain't never seen an operation like that, not even in the movies. No, don't worry. You can trust me. I'm as dumb as a totem. You don't know anything. Understand? [GUNFIRE] Look, excuse me the kick in the [INAUDIBLE].. I didn't have time to warn you. Then you're not with them. Who's them? Forget it. Here. I owe you an apology. An apology? What do you mean an apology? A guy like you doesn't have to apologize for anything. Gee whiz, I deserve that smack. Hell, if I was you, I'd have done worse. Because that's the kind of guys we are. Right? Sandro, how are you, Caro? You eating OK? The DA rejected the request for provisional liberty. You said I'd be out in three days, Massara. I couldn't foresee that they try and hit you while you were in here. Now they say they're holding you in order to protect you. What's happening on the outside? Not good, Frankie. The organization is falling apart. Your most trusted people are either dead or have gone over to Annunziata. How long are they going to keep me here? I don't know. Three months, maybe less. Too long, lawyer. Now you pay. You threaten. You do anything. You just get me out of here. [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Don't try anything. You got a piece pointed at your back. Relax. I just want some information, then you can go. Our friend Joe, I want to know how Frankie Dio managed to kill him. Frankie couldn't have done it. He was already locked up by then. Exactly. It's an old trick he invented in Chicago. A 20-year-old trick. [SIGHS] I just want to know the name of the cop that let him out. I'll take care of the rest. I don't know what you're talking about. Lawyer. Please. [DRILL WHIRRING] [SCREAMING] The charge of premeditated murder of Joseph Sciti has been brought against you. Would you like to read the charge? The district attorney isn't very well informed. When my friend passed away, I was in jail. Are you sure of that? You still maintain your version Mr. Diomedes? Or would you like to change your statement? I'd like to make a phone call to my lawyer. The attorney can be of your own choosing, otherwise, the court will appoint one. And Lauro Massara was found a few hours ago in a ditch. He was killed, Dio. And from the coroner's report, he suffered a great deal before he died. [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] No, No, Dio, it's the end of your privileges. Now get moving. Well, well, Frankie Dio, the picnic's over, huh, big shot? [LAUGHS] Now you're going to find out what it's really like to be in jail! [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] Oh. You forgot the goodies, dollface. [SCOFFS] Thanks, Tony. Your little friend takes good care of you, Tony. I bet you take good care of each other. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Hold it. Hold it. OK, Dio, now you're in the soup. Oh! Oh! [WHISTLE BLOWING] [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Hiya, partner. See. Solitary's tough, right? I heard you wouldn't need anything. That's showing them. Tony, you can't trust anybody in here. Hey, present company excluded, I hope. Here. It ain't Max's Deli, but it ain't bad. Go on. Eat it. [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [LAUGHING] Hey! Ciao, Sylvester. Are you a first class idiot? [INAUDIBLE] What a schmuck. And you have the gall to call me [INAUDIBLE].. You should thank God you got a bird friend like me to pay for a lawyer. Thanks, my ass. It's your duty, woman. And look what you got me. A community shyster. A regular assembly line. Hey, lawyer. Are you? Come here. Come here. Are you drunk? What about me? When do I get sprung? Oh, let's see. Given extenuating circumstances-- rather advanced mental retardation-- will request the court's clemency and thus possibly avoid incarceration. Are you off your tracks? Excuse me. Wrong file. Oh, now I remember. You were mixed up in a gambling raid. Yeah. You'll be out in a couple of days. When I heard that you had been charged with homicide, well, I thought it was my duty to visit you. After all, I'm your brother. Yeah. After all. Can I do anything for you? Oh, there's a lot you could do for me, Sylvester, but it wouldn't be in your line. No, all I can expect from you or cigars, or maybe some pipe tobacco, but no help. If that's the way you're going to be, I'm leaving. No wait. Wait, Sylvester. I've got something for you, Sylvester. It's important. It's the file of all the details of the organization. Names, addresses, and figures. You want to involve me in your problems? You can't really-- You'll take it. It's your duty as a good citizen, right? You take the file and give it to the police, and justice triumphs. Now wouldn't you like that? Sylvester, let's face it, I've had it. But this way, those who cut me down, they get chopped down, too. [ALARM RINGING] Train station, Box 3175. I'll remember. I spoke to my legal advisor. My girl Orchidea got me a lawyer who was first in his class at Harvard University. Can you beat it? In two weeks, I'm out. You need anything? [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] What? Hey. Hey! [MUFFLED GROANS] Could you kindly explain to me how a law abiding professional man, whose only misfortune was having a criminal for a brother, was murdered in such a manner? Could you enlighten me, Mr. Diomedes? I have nothing to say. But your brother visited you here. I wish he hadn't. You know very well that if he hadn't come he'd still be alive. What request did you make? What did he do for you? What I asked him to do isn't important anymore. Whoever killed my brother, they'll pay. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Time's up! Dry yourselves and get moving, you hear? Oh! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Hey, go climb a grease pole bare-ass, will ya'? Eat your heart's out! Tomorrow at this time, I'll be soaking in a bubble bath. Hi. You hear me in there? I'm a hard guy, huh? I'm a rock, right? Right. I open my mouth and a lot of hot air comes out. [CHUCKLES] As usual. [NON-ENGLISH] honest, Frankie. I swear. If I could, I'd let you go in my place. I know you would. If you could get me a-- Hey, Frankie, what do you-- You mean a breakout? Yeah. Gee, hey, that ain't kidding around. No, it's not. But it requires a professional, forget it. Hey, you kidding? My brain cells are already clicking. Now listen, the best time to do it is during a transfer. First, you've got to pull a transfer. That's easy. The warden, he wants to retire, right? He doesn't want anymore trouble. So? So, start a racket. A big loud one, and we're home-free. A racket, huh? What kind of a racket? Well, [INAUDIBLE]. [WHISTLING] I want a word with you. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Look out, Frankie! [WHISTLE BLOWING] Oh, geez. Fucked his head! Hey, look out! [WHISTLE BLOWING] I want you to please take notice that throughout all this I have remained even more neutral than the Swiss. Tomorrow, I get out. [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] Why, that schmuck, he-- Tony! You dirty rat. I know it was you. Poor angel. Just out of prison and the first thing he thinks about is little like Orchidea's place. Cute. Two berettas, 150. Four clips of ammunition, 3 and 1/2 apiece. So the tools, let's say 20. Comes to exactly 175. Pay 15% interest. The whole thing comes to 200 even. What's this crap? Hey, don't you trust me? You get the rest after we pull the job. I can't talk now, but it's a big deal. You just put your signature on this here piece of paper, huh? Yeah. That makes it nice and official. I don't get my money, you're the one that gets his legs broke. The crap stays here. Look. Correct information, firsthand. The transfer takes place tomorrow morning at 6:00. Destination, Novara. Ah. The Itinerary. They go through town, and then they take this country road to Novara. Now there will be four policemen in escort, including the driver. [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] [MAN SCREAMING] Something's happening. My God, look at that! Help, help, help! Pull up here! Help! Help, I lost my kid! Help me! Someone help me. Fire! Fire! Help! Help my wife! [WOMEN SCREAMING] Get my wife and kids out! Hurry! Hurry! They're still alive at any rate. It's a fake. Back to the car. Come on, run, quick. [INAUDIBLE] Gee, what do we tell them at headquarters? [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] [LAUGHS] Let's go. Keep the car, Tony. What for? How many convictions have you had? Come on, let's get going. How many convictions, Tony? One. I was released in the custody of my mother. All right. Now I owe you a lot, but I don't owe you a 6-foot hole in the ground. You still don't know me, huh? Come on. Get in. Where to? Back to Joe. Oh. [CARS HONKING] [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] Get down! That's it. Now be calm. Calm? You be calm! Oh, I'm calm. Hey. OK. Try it. This is it. [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] I knew we'd run into this. That's why I had it all worked out ahead of time. It's just a question of keeping cool. [WHIRRING] [WHIRRING] Will you cut it out? Don't you get tired of that contraption? You. Not you. [YELLS] Ha! You're finished with that damn toy? Move your ass and get me a cigar. [YELLS] Your boss, Annunziata! Where is he? [YELLING] Where is he? Where is he? He's in Marseilles. No. No. Frankie. You wouldn't do it, Frankie. No, Frankie. No. [SCREAMING] Oh, man. You are Superman! [INAUDIBLE] They got a list of the stolen cars. [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] Yeah, this is it. Elevator down to Main Street. Now I want you to wait, Franz. Yes, Madam. And if you get a parking ticket, it'll be deducted from your consideration. Is that understood? Yes, Madam. Good. Go and jump in a lake, you old witch. [HORN HONKING] Would you know where I can park? Oh, would I? Why, yes, I would. Why, I'll park it for you. Take good care of it. Like it was my own. Have no fear. Oh, what an angel. I'll only be two hours, all right? Take your time. Take longer. Oh, what a day. [HORN HONKS] Wheels under our tails we've got. And for at least a couple of hours, no problems. Where to, partner? [INAUDIBLE] Annunziata's in Marseilles. Excuse me, but maybe you don't know Europe that well. I vaguely remember that there's a border between here and there. Let's go. We'll think of something. [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] You got it yet? What? The idea. How are we going to get across the border? It'll come. Hope so. You got to figure they already know about this car at the border. [HORN HONKING] Come on. [HORN HONKING] Come on! Pull the hell over, will ya? He wants to die, that dummy. So help him die, you goddamn capitalist. [HORN HONKING] Hey, you better go home and check on your wife! The horse, and right to my face. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I'll break your back. He wants me to stop. Well. To stop or not to stop? That's a good question. I'd say stop. Mhm. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] Did I hurt you, honey? [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] Bravo, Tony. [HORN HONKING] Here I am. We got the truck. We get the documents. We're all set. [WHISTLE BLOWS] They ain't just inspectin'. They're hasslin', harassin'. Let's see. We're from Verona, and we're carrying industrial oil. Your name is Giovanni Xander. I'll just be a moment. [MUFFLED GROANING] Oh, dear. Ladies. They beat our butts and robbed the truck. I'm not a fighter. [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [SIRENS BLARING] Getting warmer, huh? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Attention all cars. Attention all cars. Signal 28, signal 28. Be on the lookout for a Mercedes truck, Verona license plates, 3-1-7-1-K-W-4-5. Move over, kid. We got it, Frank. Frank, look out, the truck! Yah! Whoo! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Hello. Look out for car. Look out for the car! Look out! Bonjour. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [LAUGHING] Are you nuts? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] You've blown your cork. Hey, listen. Do you realize that the most that's ever happened to me is that I've been chased by a few sleepy watchmen? Now look. I got half the police force after me. Yeah, now Tony Breda has become public enemy number two. Hey, give us a push. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SINGING IN ITALIAN] Look out for the whatchamacallit! [HORNS HONKING] [SIRENS BLARE] Hang on! Stop! Stop! [YELLING] [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] [DOG BARKING] That boat isn't yours. Thieves! All right, take it easy now. Just keep it quiet. You keep in pretty good shape, you know. Frankie. Frankie Dio. I never thought I'd see you here. Hey, come on, you stay in pretty good shape yourself. This guy a friend of yours? I am glad to meet you. Yeah, glad to meet you. You know that for you I'd do anything. Thanks to him I'm still alive. It was back in Chicago about 20 years ago. Ah, forget it, you know. That's ancient history. You have any contacts in Marseilles? Oui. I want Annunziata. He's got his base in a frozen fish plant, probably the biggest drug depo in Europe. I know it's like a fortress with the most modern alarm system, and at least a half dozen guards. The police have been trying to track it down for years. They say they are looking for the big fish, but it's the little fish they should be looking for. Annunziata's boys insert a packet of heroin, freeze the fish, then ship it to their outlet in the States. A very smart and profitable operation. But tell me, Frankie, what is it that you want of me? I'm going to need the blueprints of the place, including the alarm system, then some transportation, and a gun. Wait a minute, Frenchie. Make it two. Yeah, make that two guns. Him and me. We're like that. Are you really sure you want to go through with this, Frankie? It's asking for it. I know. The important thing right now is to break our way in. Coming, Tony? Yeah, nice seeing you. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Yeah. [BANGING] Uh-oh. Hey, that was real neat. [CHUCKLES] [HORN HONKING] [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [ALARM BLARING] [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] Oh! [GUNSHOTS] [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC] [BOAT HORN HONKING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] Oh! [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] [GUNFIRE] [GUN CLICKS] [GUNSHOT] Oh! [DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [GASPING] Look, Frankie. Frankie, please. I'll give you everything. That's what you want, ain't it? Your brother was business, not personal. It was a mercy killing. Frankie, it's all yours. Just let me live. [GUNSHOT] What do you say, Frankie? I wouldn't do anything to get even with you. I wouldn't. Honest, Frankie. [WIND BLOWING] You're kidding. You wouldn't do that. No. Frankie. No! Please, Frankie, please. Hey, wait a minute. Listen. That poor guy in there. The one I blasted. Kid-- I never killed anybody before. Forget it. He's not a poor guy, and you did not kill him. Now come on, let's go. Let's go. Take care of yourself, Frankie. Frankie, you better hurry. The boat's getting ready to leave. Thanks, Tony. Thanks a lot for everything. Thanks? What do you mean, thanks? I don't get to go to Tangiers? Frankie, we start from zero. You and me. Yeah. We're at zero, Tony, but you're just beginning, and I'm all finished. All the heavies are dead and dying, Tony, and that includes me. Now you've seen a lot, and you've learned a lot. Now you go on back and forget this kind of life. It's not for you. Good luck, Tony, and thanks again. Ciao. Hey, did you read this? After the bloody gangland massacre in Marseilles, no trace of Frankie Dio could be found. French officials admit that all they have is the near-- Well, I'm back. Aren't you glad to see me? What's happening? What's everybody doing? Reading. You've been away? Where was I? Oh, yeah, yeah. The nearest circumstantial evidence to go on, but they assure that Dio and an unknown accomplice were responsible for the killings. The accomplice, police point out, would have to be one of the most highly polished professionals in the underworld. Frankie Dio they say is a man who works only with the best in the business. Tall, handsome extremely attractive to women, Dio reportedly exudes a personal charm so potent that he can get anything he wants by simply raising his finger. The fact that women sense this power, however, does them little good as Frankie Dio is a known misogynist. What's that, lawyer? A woman hater. What's that mean? He's a fag? No, he just prefers the company of men. Lets women eat their heart out. Hey, Tony, would you like to join me at the conference table? You got mind, kid. Now don't waste my time. I'm a busy man. I know a pretty good job you can, like, pull. Yeah, I'll bet. It's a laundry. A towel a piece. Watch them dry. I'm serious, Tony. Now listen to me, pal. I want to give you a little advice. Start living in the real world. You want scratch? You earn it, pal. Forget all about jobs, see. Listen, I'll tell you the whole story someday, OK? I got to wait for my scratch? [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC]
