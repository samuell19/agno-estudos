[silence] I told you, out there's the kiddy sandbox. Dig and you'll strike urine. Hey? What you doing? Just reading my romance novel and farting. You know... - That's so gross! The usze. I had such a shitty night. God. From a guy's perspective- what... ...I don't know, you know I get dressed up, I go out and Synthia? She takes her shirt off or whatever and guys like, buy her drinks. They invite her into the VIP room, they... you know, they're all over her. And I just... I don't know, I feel like I just sit there. And I'm like, invisible. She took her top right off? That's not funny. - So, she took her top 'right off'?... - No! You know what I mean! I just don't... - I'm sorry I missed that. I'm done. I can't take it anymore. I'm being stupid, aren't I? I should go sleep this off. I'm going to sleep this off. Hey, you forgot your laundry downstairs. Your clothes are going to rot if you keep doing that. You don't want moldy panties. Hey, sorry. I ran out of hairspray. I had to use egg whites. That's interesting. Yeah. - Is that normal? - Ow. My head. It hurts. - What, from the egg-whites? - I wish. What's wrong? What's wrong? It's lunch rush, for starters. Okay. So you're ready for a challenge? How many we got? Eight. Maybe nine or ten with the kitchen staff. - So we should aim for 15 today. - Okay! You're friend does exist. Hi. Coffee? Yeah, please. Sure, I'll take a warm-up, thank you. This waitress has been very, very... - Thank you. Anything else? ...Right. Yes! Um, are you eating? No. Okay, I'll have the number three, with whole wheat toast. Okay. Bacon or sausage with that? Sausages, yes. Hmm...sausages. Are they the small ones or the flat, spicy kind? No, they're just the regular run-of-the-mill link sausages. Right. They're in a link? Like, in cartoons? I don't like that. I like them separate. No, they're just regular. They're cut. Um, okay. - So then, you're going to go with the sausages then? - The sausages. Okay. The sausages, then? And, uh, instead of the hashbrowns, can I just get more sausages? No. Sorry, I can't do that. We only do a meat for meat substitution for a meat. Meat for a meat. Um, how about the eggs? No, it's meat for meat. Eggs aren't meat. - More sausage? No. I can't. I'll have the number three, then. I'd like an application to the pancake club as well. What the hell was that? Well, they do this pancake club thing and I want in on it. If I'm going to make this a regular occurrence. No. Look, this is all the low impact stuff. We still have a lot of places to go. I have it all planned out. Look, what are you going to do? You gonna listen from back stage? You worked on that piece for half a year! This is the perfect opportunity for you to prove you can stand amongst 300 people and say, "Yes- I can act normal!" - Mm-hmm. You know, the fact you got so fucked up, you never even left the apartment The whole time I was away. - I wasn't fucked up, I was working. It scares the shit outta me. Stop it! I wasn't fucked up, I was working. Besides, you know this is gonna get you work. It's gonna get you really good work. And you won't have to anymore crap for that black belt fundamentalist. Avoiding his calls all the time. How many messages has he left you? And remember what I told you when I gave those to you. Snap one for mild, two for medium. Three for stronger. They worked... God. They worked for me just don't play them like an instrument! It's too complicated. You guys look like an old married couple. Ouch! What a night, huh? For some of us, maybe. That guy not even buy you breakfast? Nah, I think I heard him leaving around eight this morning. Probably after he pissed in your hat and raided the fridge for cheese and wonder-wizz. Wow. I did not know my private life was your roomie's prime source of entertainment. If that's the case, tell him next time he wants to hear me take it up the ass, I'll cut a hole in the wall. Oh, he's shy! Where are you going? I have a lot work to do. No! We have stuff to do today! I don't have time for this. Here's my grocery list. No! Nathan, I am not getting your groceries by myself again! Come... What are you laughing at? I told her you were back by the way. Are you going to take her out? Of course you did. Not everything has to be some big surprise. Just have her home by dinner. - Hey! - Hey. Okay, hold on, I'm going to get in the back. Okay. Scoot over. How's it going? Good! Good. How's school? It was fun. Fun? You have a boyfriend yet? - No! - Peg, did you take my lighter? - No? No. You know what? If you do this real hard, you can see things. Don't do that, you'll push your eyes right back into your brain. - Hey. - Hey! What you doing here? Hi, I just brought my sister. She loves art. - Oh, great. - God, is this your place? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is. Trying to be respectable, you know. It's really nice. Thanks. So, uh... You look so much, uh, better, you know? I like what you've done with your hair. - Yeah? - Yeah. Flipped it out. It's, uh, it's good. Good. So, what's up kiddo? You... Not much. Just working. I never really see you around anymore. Yeah, well, I've been busy with the gallery, right, you know and stuff, right... I never see you at all. Are things good? Yeah. Yeah, things are good. So I was thinking, you know, maybe I could come and visit? Look. I-I feel responsible for what happened. You know, I... I'm better now. No, you're not. I'm better now. Anything I have left of a good conscience would not let me bring you into that environment. You can't come, that's it. You can't. You're not better. Okay? I just... I miss you. What we had was good, right? It wasn't that special, I mean... [sighs] You gave in other asshole guys like me, right? You know, in a couple months you're gonna look back on us and, you know, "what the hell was I thinking?" Yeah. Well, I have to go. Now, wait. Don't. - Don't. I have to go. Peg. If I needed somethin', you could get it for me, right? Mm-hmm. 'Course. The question is, do you want it? Yeah. Well, can't you just ask him yourself? Hey. Have something in mind? Yeah. Something special. [phone rings] I picked up your groceries! [phone continues to ring] [phone ringing in distance] [phone message] I know it's late, but I need to reach you... - Hi! - ...If I could just hear a bit of what you've been working on. It's Reverend Appleton. Whatcha doing? Is that what I think it is? Oh, yeah! This thing? It's exactly what you think it is. I got it on 55th. 55th? Is that place clean? It's fine. It's clean. It's real? You wanna look at it? Not really. Not right now. It's not going anywhere. - So sexy! Very nice. You know what, you don't have to like it. Why didn't you go for the tramp stamp? Just cut to the chase. I like it. And not even you can upset me this evening because I am in a good mood. So I'm going to go and be in a good mood. And I'll leave you to do your "work." Who's she? I don't much care really. Well, one more of these and she's gonna puke. Well, next round's on me, then. What are you doing here all alone? Well, the night's still young. Besides, what if I told you my heart's already taken? Yeah, right. Oh, yeah. Broker friend's back from overseas. Brought back a new yacht, too. - That guy with the cowboy boots? - Yep. Oh, yeah, so I'm thinking it might be time to get my sea legs and wrap them tightly around his waist. - Yeah, but cowboy boots? Really? Who wears cowboy boots on a yacht? Well, I guess he should feel lucky I'm not as superficial as you. Hey. Your new tat, what's it of, anyway? Oh, this? Just something ideal for a highly superficial chick like myself. Pretty cool, hey? Nothing else like it around. - It's okay. - Well, see ya. She's pretty. Look, I told you I don't want you doing that stuff anymore. I can make my own decisions. I'm a big girl. Stop it! You could have easily gone to someone else for a hit besides her, but you went knowing it'd get back to me! I'm done losing sleep over you! I'm wiping my hands! - I don't know why you're stressing. - Funny. Everything is fine. Life's good! - Hey, you can go ahead and kill yourself! See if I care! You're here aren't you? Do you want to know why? So I can say my bit, go home with a clear conscience, and fuck someone sane. Got it? No, no, no, wait, seriously. How many scenes of people crying? One character can cry twice, tops. - It was a misdirection technique... - Seriously. ... for the worse of the movie then the least you'd bitch about the 15 people in the theater. - Well, I guess it worked. - Can you look at this? It hurts so bad. Does it look bad? Don't touch it, it hurts! It looks bad doesn't it? - It doesn't look good. - Fuck. Have a seat on the couch. All right, let's put a little of this on there. Eek. Cold. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. Well, it's taking everything in me not to say what I think. Yeah, well, just saying you don't want to say what you're sayin' if you think it. Wow! Shut up! It's not funny! Talk much? This isn't... This isn't a funny situation. I got slimed. Hopefully that'll help. What was that all about? Why didn't you fuck me that time? What? That time. After school started. At The pool party. Why didn't you fuck me? Ah. 9th grade? What are you talking about? I was drunk. And I was laying there. We were alone. Do you think I'm repulsive? Koffie, no I don't, all right? I'm sick and tired of this self-inflected, ego slaughtering bullshit with you. I mean, just... what do you want me to say? I don't know! I just... Yeah I wanted to blow my juvenile wad all over your tits! Is that what you want me... Do you feel better? - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I just feel like I'm damaged goods or something. Well, you're not. Well, I feel like it. Like, I don't know, I just... I just feel like... Like I can't get someone to... Like I can't. Nobody... Like I can't get somebody to love me, you know? It's stupid. - You can. No! It's...I don't know, I try everything... I try! I don't-I don't understand. And I'm so sick of it! And I just wanna make someone's heart race. And I just wanna make somebody jealous for once. And I just want someone to freak out if I don't call them or if I disappear, I just want to feel that, you know? And I just feel like I wanna scream all the time. - Well, maybe you should scream. - I can't take it anymore. Maybe you should scream. Oh, shut up! Seriously. It's not... I just, I'm waiting for something and I just... Don't wait. Stop waiting. Why are you doing that? Why are you... Stop telling me that! It's... Fuck, I just, I just want to, like, feel something again, you know? Something so good. And I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything! And I don't know what's wrong with me. I just think... I'm sorry. Koffie? [eerie echo] Koffie? No. [eerie echo] Relax. Please. Relax. Please. Please. Koffie? [eerie whisper] Our skin yearns. What the fuck! Give in... Don't resist. Give in. Give in. [groans] [exhales] [eerie echo] Yes, our skin should be pure. Not scarred. Unblemished. Be pure. Please, Koffie, listen. All will be fine. Listen Koffie. No more cuts. Morning. No more cuts. All will be fine. No more scars. Special. Our skin is special. All will be fine. Please don't resist, Koffie. [Nathan] Hey, uh, about last night. Please, Koffie. Listen. Don't be afraid. Listen, please. Please. Say something. Last night, we became something new. [eerie echoing] Something special. Say something...anything. Koffie. Right now. People are driving to church and walking their dogs. And I'm sitting here talking to my tattoo. I don't know what to say. Our skin is so splintered. Tells tales of such pain. It should be pure. It says it wants to feel again. Breathe again. Let go. Let go. Breathe again. [cries out] [moans] How did you know about me and my toes? [eerie echo] Our skin knows all its secret places. My last boyfriend couldn't even look at my feet. I'm so happy you're here. I never want to be alone again. We will never be alone again. So what else do you wanna talk about? You've been busy? Yeah. How's the piece? It's good. Yeah. It's really interesting. Weather's been beautiful. How about that new, uh, whatever whatcha-ma-call it? Look, let's fuck the tea talk, okay? Whoa. We've been riding this for over an hour and it's not working. [eerie voice] Then why are we here? This is what is called flooding. It's a form of operant conditioning or immersion therapy where you recondition yourself to negative stimuli. - He should be grateful. All we do, but he doesn't seem to care. - Look, I think you got it a little confused. - We talk and talk and talk. You mis-diagnosed me. My issue isn't badly thought-out therapy. ... talking, talking... Hey, hey, I did my research. I picked a building with light foot-traffic. - Koffie? - So you need to stop being so tense. - Are you ignoring me? - I just realized that... - You can try. Not all geniuses are brooding. You need to realize we need to take time for our self. I'm a sociophobe. I'm not anti-social. - You're bipolar, chemically imbalanced, whatever. Visiting places where no words are needed. Visiting places for our self. - I'm just reminding you that... - Places that are warm. - ... things might happen to you in your life... - For our self. - ... that you don't expect. - And...wet. And they can like, surprise you. You okay? Yeah. Oh, my God. Some are scary you know, scary to give into. You sure you're all right, what the hell? What's wrong with you? - Yeah. Um, yeah, some are, uh, sometimes you have to just embrace the world around you, you know and just... What? - You know... - That's not right. ...all the crazy insanity of life. Oh, my God! God, no! What?! Why care about Nathan? Taking him out into the world? I've known him since I was 14. And after high school, I just wanted to party and get fucked up. He was there to help me. He made me go to hospital after he found out I was a mule for Alan. He's always been the one I trust. My conscience. Before you came along, of course. What are you thinking about? [eerie voice] Just that words like "I" and "you" and "before," they separate us. Well "I" is the difference between you and me. Between one person and another. - But we don't want that. - But I don't want that. [echoing] There shouldn't be a difference. Well, there is. And "before?" Is your past. It's another place. Well, we should visit this before. [echoing] Together. You know we could have picked you up from the station, like we did your cousin. Oh, cousin Mary, and her little boy. He says "mama" already. Remember it took you forever to start talking, Koffie? No, I don't remember that. Because I was way too young but what I do remember is you constantly reminding me of the fact. So, this is a whole different look for you. None of your crazy make up, we can finally see your face. Don't know what your mother will think of the tattoo, though. Oh, well, we can add that to the list. I hate tattoos. I find them cheap and unsightly. I think it's cool. You get it done on your trip? My trip? Yeah, well, while you were away, mom and dad said you'd send postcards. - Oh. They did, did they? Yeah. I even drew things to send to you. Wow, that was inconsiderate of me not to send anything back. Yeah. And we also said that you'd come back. And here you are. Well, you should have prepared her for the fact that I'd probably let her down like I always do. You don't need to be so theatrical. Theatrical? Yeah, you know nothing about that. Turn around. Sit up straight and eat your food. Your dad will cut it for you. How big do you want the pieces? Nice and big. Well, at least you got an imagination Peggers. Tell that to your dad. He wants the same thing to eat every night of the week. There you go. There's potatoes if anybody wants them. Are you okay, honey? Why don't you just give her some space? Just asking her a question. She's only... - I'm asking her a question! - You're smothering her! Honey? Is this about your old room? No, it's not about my old room. And it's not about you telling Peg that I would send her postcards. It's not about the fact that you, dear father have known for what is it, 15 years now that mom has been fucking some asshole and you've done fuck all about it! It's about the fact that I would like to sit at this table again, and eat with a fucking knife! You know, I used to wonder why you started to bring her out but I get it now! I get it. - Oh, thank you! Thanks for the drink. Mr. Satori! How are you? - Good. Next round's on me. The pleasure was mine. Yeah and why is that? - Huh, because of your new gallery... - Look at him. Nothing's changed. You don't love this silly man anymore and the world he lives in. You can't worry about him and what he thinks about us. We have to be selfish. [echoing] Thrive. For our own life, we must let go. - Hey. - Hey, there. - How you doing? - I'm doing good. - You look good. - Thank you. - You know anything about this? - About what? Did you say anything to anybody? My God, you're sweating. I didn't say anything to anyone. But you know what, if you wanna clear that, uh, conscience of yours, why don't you go fuck someone sane! [echoing] That's from Nathan. Yeah. He gave me this when I gave him my bands. They were this silly technique that we used in the hospital whenever we'd get an urge. I thought maybe, you know, he could use them now. God, it's so funny how fucked up things can get. All of a sudden you end up somewhere and don't know how to get back. But helping him, you know, makes me feel a little more sane. More sane. He's just as lost and vulnerable as I was. But you know what, out of all the people, I think he would understand the most about you though. I hope. [echoing] And yet you couldn't tell Nathan the truth. That it wasn't Alan that cut you. [giggles] Oh, I thought maybe... I, um... Oh, sorry, I thought maybe that, uh... Ask nicely and I just might let you in to watch. I don't know what you're upset about. I mean, I already told you I like it when people take an interest in me. I see how you look at me. I do. I bet you like comics and you like the way the women are drawn. And I bet you like a trucker mouth, too, huh? I mean, we might as well just be honest, right? You never know what you can get if you just ask. Ask me. Have you seen Koffie? It's not like I don't feel sorry for you. I can understand your need to whack off to someone, now that she's smitten for that new guy. I understand. What are you talking about? That giddy roommate of yours. Probably drawin' flowers as she chats away on the phone. - Hey, whoa! - Yeah. I could make you forget her. - No, thank you. - When a girl like me has to... - Hey, hey. I gotta give back sometime, you know? I gotta give back. You're just a party girl who's past her expiry date. And hasn't seemed to have figure that out yet. Knock, please? Uh, okay. Look at this. Do you see what the collar's doing? Yeah. Come here. - Because the tie is riding up. - Okay, come here. - See how it's doing... All right. - Yeah, stop it! There. It did look weird. Now this looks great. This suit really fits you. God, I love it. - You sure? Yeah! - Thanks. - You look so handsome. Thanks. It's been a while since we've done anything. Ah... you're missing quality time. No. I'm just making an observation. - Um, okay. Is there anything new? There. No. Nothing. Why? - I don't know. - Oh, those? Those are just bags of clothes. I'm giving them away. It kind of looks like you're moving out. No. God, don't be silly. It's just that they-they just rub my skin. They kinda give me a rash. Like the wools and the most rayons? It's like little razor blades all over my skin. It's stupid. I mean, I'm being crazy. I'd be the first to know if there was anything wrong. Everything is great! I'm feeling the best that I have ever felt! Anyways, this is your night, are you ready? Yeah. Think so. We're sticking to the plan right? Right? - Yeah, well, you know, in life you need to adapt. - No. - So, I got a ton of things to do but your gonna go. You're gonna wait outside... - Koffie. And then I'm gonna come and meet you, and then we'll go in together. You are ready! - Koffie. Yay! I just have so much to do. I need to stick to the plan. I have to sew that! I have to, you know, fix that to find a dress. I mean, I have a ton of stuff to do. So you just go and I will meet you there. It's gonna be great. You are going to be great. I'll be in front of the theatre at 7:30. I'll meet you there. - Okay, I will be there, I will be there. - Okay? - Just go, it's going to be so great! Okay. [echoing] Stop making excuses for him. He shouldn't be so selfish. He's just nervous! I shoulda' mentioned something about you to him before now. Now I think he knows! He's had before to enjoy your life. Many befores. Why should he have more when we've had so few? Yeah...I guess. You've sat through enough of his silly paranoid performances. He's my best friend! He's always been there for me. I don't... What you and I have is just... What do we have? It only seems to matter what Nathan wants. Why are you making this so difficult? Difficult? Because it's clear it doesn't seem to matter what I want! Yes. I have come to understand the word, and all that comes with it. Of course it matters to me what you want. What are you so worried about? Will you ever burn memories of me? No. Will I ever become your before? Of course not! What do you expect me to say? What do you want me to say? I'd like to hear you say we won't go. That you want to be alone with just me tonight. Of course. I knew I'd find you here! You got to think I'm an idiot, but... I've been calling. - No, no. - I've been calling. I've been leaving messages. I-I'm sorry I haven't called you this week. I promise I will. Your composition's almost finished but, um... I'll just, uh...leave me alone? I mean, uh, what I mean is I'll call you. I have a lot of respect for you. I just, uh, been really busy. Yeah, I got that. [audience clapping] Hey. How'd it go? I thought the rounds of triplets were gonna be the hard part, but... They kinda made a clustefuck of the improvised bits. Still, it was nice to hear it played out loud. Nathan? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I got so sick. A woman's thing. I was! I was so sick. I vomited all over the sink. Blah! Who's the guy? What? - What guy? - Who's the guy? The guy you're seeing. Synthia told me. I mean, I hear you in your room. - I thought this was about me not coming out. I already knew. No, I just don't understand why you didn't mention him. I don't know. Why should I? Well, I didn't think it was a problem. It's not. Do you think I judge you? What you expect me to say? And how about you ask me, you know, is he nice? Who is he? Does he make you happy? Is he funny? - Okay. Is he funny? - Why is everything always about you? - Is he nice? Who is the guy?! - You sit in your room all the time. Yeah, you sit all alone in your room, all propped up on a bed waiting for a flood! My life is not your life! I am happy! - For once in my life, I'm happy! - Waiting for a flood! Waiting for a flood! Why can't you just be happy for me! I am. YEAH! IT SEEMS LIKE IT! No, seriously, congratulations. I'm very, very happy for you. You should get some sun. You're starting to look like a ghost. [echoing] You mustn't regret your actions. You made me aware not so long ago, that one eventually lets go of the past. That nothing is forever. But I realize something more, that sometimes you must let go of things dear to you, if you're ever to love yourself. But that's so difficult. I just... I wish you could sometimes see the way that I see things... I see all that matters. I see you for all that you are. I love you, you know. I love you. [echoing] These people, this place, is vile. You should quit working here. What choice do I have? But you'll only encounter your past. And it's dangerous. I kinda don't wanna talk about this right now. I really just want to enjoy a night out. Oh, my God, you're not all knotted up over that stick with the training wheels. You know, just fuckin' leave me alone. You are! Okay, how about I was told he was down south on business and he shows up here with that fuckin' cunt sporting matching tans, huh! - Well, you know what, the guy is a douche bag. - Shit. You can't let someone like that run life. You're stronger than that! You would tell me to swallow it, so swallow it! Just fucking go, okay? Okay. Fucking fuck. Fucking shit, motherfucking, shit. Shit! Motherfucking... [screams] Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking fuck! Whoa. You look like shit. Synthia and I just got into it with some chicks. Ow. You should quit that place. Oh, I know. Believe me, I know! Are you okay? Yeah. I... I had some crazy idea that we would, uh, just live here like, uh, this for, uh, for a long time. Aw, Nathan. Come here. It's good. I'm sorry! Right now I just wanna hop in the tub and then go to bed. I'm sorry. Good night. Night. Shit! Oh, my God, my knuckles hurt. What's wrong? You're so quiet. Is something wrong? Nothing is wrong. Well it doesn't seem like it. Ah! [echoing] Explain to me what just happened. What just happened was I haven't been in a fight since I was 14. Tracey Donnan who musta' weighed 180 pounds.. I tell you to leave your work behind, yet you wouldn't hear any of it... ...fat fuckin' bitch. but Nathan speaks about it and you listen. What are you talking about? [whispering] Are you even listening to me now? I'm listening. Then why are you avoiding my questions? I'm not avoiding you. Don't be so silly. Silly? How am I being silly? How is me expressing myself to you silly? Uh, look, I'm not unhappy with you, I just... I guess I haven't been feeling myself lately, but it has nothing do about the way that I feel about you. So, you found comfort in Nathan instead? Would you leave him and never speak to him again if I asked? Why would you ask that? Would you? If I asked. Nathan is my friend. He's just a friend. Don't you dare lie to me! Your body betrays you! When he held you, you pressed into him. Your nipples hardened... - Whoa, how can you say that?! - Your pussy went moist! It's sickening the two of you together. - Stop it! The way you feed off each other! - Go away! - Cling to each other! Leave me alone! Fine. I'll go. Come on, I did what you said! I'm not gonna talk to anybody about us ever again. I promise! If this is about Nathan? I won't talk to him. Ever. I won't talk to him ever again. Women are just naturally jealous of females like myself... and Pamela and... - Pamela! - Yeah. 'Cause we have such great tits. Right? And then, I'm all like... Chicks are just fucking jealous 'cause we got really good fuckin' nice, very nice tits. Right? - They're so jealous. They're nice right? They're so nice. Fucking right they cost more than a... You're always really dressed up, hey? Well, you know, I think it's essential. I do. I think it's very essential. You never know when you're going to get a piece of ass knocking. You're a slut! You're a total slut! I even caught your roommate sniffin' around. No. No, you didn't. - Oh, yes I did. No, you didn't! Oh, fuck yeah, man. I got the goods! - Nathan? No! - Oh, yeah! No. No. Nathan, no. I don't know why you just don't bang him, and get it over with, you know? - No. - Go fucking bang him. Oh, my God. No. Oh, my God. Oh, my fuckin' God. Oh my God. Where you going, honey? Where you going? Oh, hello monkey. My sister has this! She has the same one in pink. Put it down. Put it down. Put. It. Down. Your sister. How old is she? She's nine. She just turned nine. I missed her birthday. Well, I'm sure she understands. Peg? Hey! Hey. - Koffie! Hey, how's it goin'? Mom here? No. Listen, why don't we go and hang out? Just the two of us. You know, we can go and do some stuff. I don't know. I got school, and mom's picking me up because I have band practice. Oh, fuck band practice! Hey, did they tell you that I went on vacation again? I gotta go. They did, didn't they? They lie, Peg! They lie! Come on. There you go. That's a good girl, yeah. Yeah. You sleepy? One more pill. Come on. Just one more pill. - No. No. - Make you go to sleep. Go to sleep. I'll let myself out. Yeah. Koffie? You asleep? Why you being so nice to me? Everyone needs someone. And you make me feel good. Important. You could be out. I don't know why you're spending the whole day in bed with me. Yeah, well, maybe I'm getting a bit old for that. I don't wanna to float around anymore. I want something more. Like you have. What's it like? Huh? It's hard to remember sometimes. I dunno. It's like a dream. I envy you. I don't know what's real anymore. Oh, it's real. And it's always there. Because love never seems to be around much when you need it. [echoing] What you got is so special. So special. Koffie? What are you doing? How do you know about it?! How do you know about it?! - Koffie. Can you please come back to bed! Do you want to know why I did what I did? I did it because you never ask me how I am. How I feel. I wanted you to feel spiteful as I do of Nathan. I want you to understand. For I need you to believe in me for my very breath. Yeah, right. Do you hear that? A voice just now? Didn't think so. Hi! Work nights a lot? Past two years. You ever get lonely? I got myself to talk to. You don't want to be doing that! Really. Believe me, you do not wanna be doing that! You're crazy if you do that! Hey, look miss, we're about to close up here, so, um... You have a girlfriend? No? That's good. Because you know what? Sometimes you think you have something. You're told things. Whispers. You think you know, but you don't know. Because it's all head games. It's all head games! What's your name? - Ted. - Ted? Oh. Hi. I think you're cute. Ted. I want you to show me something. I want you, to show me something special. Ah! Koffie. Did Alan do this to you? Hmm? Look at me, look at me. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry, baby. Hey, here! Come here. Help me get her inside! You okay? Yeah, let me look at you. Oh, honey. Yeah. [moans] [echoing whisper] Koffie? I'm sorry about how things have ended with Nathan. I'm also sorry for hurting us. But I'm the only one that knows of your need. The only one that understands your desire. Your compulsion to starve, stick your finger down your throat, concoct, and cut. I offer my forever. All I ask for is yours. I used to fear a time when you no longer needed me. Where I no longer exist. But now I know we will always be together. Always. In our before. You said you wish I could see what you see. Close your eyes. Koffie? Close your eyes. Please. Close your eyes as you did as a child... Hey. Koffie? You in here? [echoing] All we do and he doesn't seem to care. We need to talk! - We've sat through enough of his silly performances. - I don't feel anything anymore. Anything! - Koffie. - And I don't know what's wrong with me! I don't need your help! I'm very, very happy for you. - You're smothering her! - Is it me? - Why can't you just be happy for me! - Who is the guy? Koffie, Koffie, are you okay? You all right? - Nathan. - Huh? I went to, um, Alan's. He told me everything. It wasn't Alan. Okay, but... It never was Alan! It's my tattoo...I love it, it's mine! No one else can have it, it's mine! I'm in love with my tattoo. It's mine! We have to get you some help. No one else can have it. [echoing] Who's at the door? Who's at the door? I called-I called someone. Leave us alone! Who's at the door, Nathan? I don't need your help! - Koffie. - Who is at the door, Nathan? - It's okay. It's a friend. - Who is at the door, Nathan? - Trust me! - Let me go! Leave us alone! Who's at the door?! - Trust me! - Leave us alone! Let me...Leave us alone! Nathan! Leave us alone! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan?! It's going to be okay. I'm going to get you help. I don't want to... I don't want to go back. I don't want to go back. - It's okay. You don't have to. You don't have to. It's going to be all right. It's going to be okay. There's nothing anyone can say that can make me believe. The doctors, it doesn't matter what the doctors say. We don't need help. Well, we all need help. The doctors and everyone wants what I have. But they cant have it, because what I have is unique and it's special. Right. Okay, you think it's unique? It's not! It's special... because it's mine. Is that what you think? Listen, change of plans. Okay, can you go up to 47th, and I'll direct you from there... - I...I don't know how comfortable I feel about this... - Do you want your composition? Yes of course. Okay. Please, drive. What I have is special! Okay, okay, have a seat. - No! Special! - Unique? - What your friend is about to do is cruel. - What's this? Is this book number seven? - Remember you are my everything. My shelter. My sky. - Page four, book seven. What the fuck is that? - You must remember. What this, right here? You recognize this? Look familiar to you? - What we have is special! - How many other girls?! It's mine! - Special. - No one else can have it! No, it's mine! - Special. - Hey! Hey, man, you can't come in here! You! You bitch! - Get the fuck outta my shop! No! Calm down! No! You promised me! - Koffie, Koffie! Koffie! Koffie! Koffie! What the fuck? Koffie! Hey! Hey! Open this door! Cops are on the way, asshole! I don't care, call the cops! - Koffie! - They're trying to separate us. Can you hear me? I can't go on like this anymore! Open this door, okay? Koffie? I've felt it for a while. I'm dying. - Open this door! And to think you will go on without me. Because I can't go on without you. - You open this door! - Without you needing me. I know you've thought about death yourself. Let's do it together. Okay. Open this door! I need to feel you one more time. Please! Of course. Of course. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. All right, I believe you, just open this fuckin' door. All right, please? Don't fuck around. I believe you. It's going to be okay. Don't worry. It will all be over soon. One cut. Deep. Then we will always be together. Don't worry. I'll never leave you. I'm always here. Always. I love you, too. [screaming in pain] [Nathan grunts]
