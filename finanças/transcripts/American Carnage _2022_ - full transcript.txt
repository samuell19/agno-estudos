(upbeat music) (dog growling) (crickets chirping) (majestic music) - Welcome. Welcome to the land of the free, home of the brave. A country of the people, by the people, (plane engines roaring) for the people. Where if you work hard, your dreams can come true. A safe haven for families from all walks of life. On behalf of everyone from this great land, we welcome you, embrace you, because we need you. - In Spanish, braceros means a man who works with arms and hands. - We need leaders. - And the Oscar goes to... - We need icons. - I'd like to thank... - Mi gente Latino. - We need entertainment. - Hi, baby bear, I'm Dora. - And I'm- - Miguel. (guitar riff) - Quite a run. - Immigrants. - We get the job done. - We need fresh ideas. - Barbie in Mexico is stunning in her ceremonial dress, and her chihuahua is adorable. (in Spanish) - But most of all... (in Spanish) We need villains. - So you can point your fucking fingers, and say, "That's the bad guy." - So we can scare people. (upbeat music) - They're immigrants. They're invaders. - Let me finish! Let me finish. Let me finish! (Joker laughing) - These aren't people. These are animals. - Why do you hate us? Because we're Mexicans? - As the illegal invasion at our southern border intensifies... - We're gonna do whatever is necessary to build a wall. - And a one-way ticket back to where you came from. - It is an invasion. - I'm fucking American! Don't fucking touch my burrito, bitch! - So there's an enemy to fight. - If you don't speak English and don't contribute, get out. - The best way to describe them is to be more like a summer camp. - To make money. - It does seem like the America that we know and love doesn't exist anymore. - To stay in power. And most importantly, to feel like heroes. - It does not mean, because we created them, that we somehow forgive them or do not take them out of society to protect my family and yours from them. - Do not come. Do not come. - This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. - God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

You think because I'm serving you that I'm your servant, right? - You understand this? Huh? Habla dinero? Lameass wetback. - Wetback. Ooh, wetback? Okay, so you've been a racist your whole life, I'm guessing. And you're telling me the best you can come up with is wetback? Really? Why don't I give you a little help here? Excuse me. Customers of Lady Liberty, can I have your attention, please? I have these two lovely gentlemen here in front of me, and they're wondering if we have any wetbacks here tonight. - What are you doing? - Do we have any beaners here? Any greasers- - Can I just get my burger? - What about some vatos or some cholos, huh? Motor bandits. - Hey, go back to where you came from, bro. (car engine roaring) - Thank you valued customer. Have a nice day. - Hey! Making friends, I see. Dang, such a social butterfly. - You know me, girl, just gotta call out the haters of the world. - Okay. - Oh, and Andrea look, I got this very special milkshake for you. - Oh, I'm vegan. - She vegan, bro. - You're vegan? - Sorry. - Girl, I'm an Aquarius, I think the universe might be trying to tell us something, huh? - Do you feel that? - It's in the air or something. - I can almost hear it. - Please stop. - Oh, shh, we're having a moment. Shh, shh! - I hear it too. What is that? What is that? - JP, code 12 in the bathroom. Someone clogged the shitter again. (girls chuckling) - Nice try, twerp. I'll take that. Oh, mom wants us home at eight. Try to make that. - Wait, why eight? - You didn't hear? Lily got into Columbia! - Girl. Oh, not now. - Oh God, I'm so sorry. I didn't realise. I'm so sorry. - You got into Columbia? - Yeah. - Isn't that kinda far? - Come on, move it. (car honking) - You got some people in the back here. Don't worry about it. I love you, loser! - Bye! Love you, bye! - So, when were you gonna tell me? - Aren't you happy for her? - Yeah, it's just like New York is far away, so... - She will always be there for you. You'll be there for her tonight? - Yeah, of course I'm gonna be there. (speaking in Spanish) I love you too. (ominous music) (door bangs) Hello? - Get down on the motherfucking ground! - Shit! - Say hello to WorldStar, pussy. - Scott Williams of Riverside once sharted in third period French. - Come on, man. Low blow. Never should have told you that. - Nope. - Well, so anyway, I heard your sis got into college. - Yeah. - How you holding up? - It's always been her dream to get into an Ivy League school. So that's pretty good. I'm happy for her there. And now we got a place to stay in the Big Apple, huh? And college parties and girls, it's gonna be lit. - My man. You know, I cannot wait to give one of those rich girls the famous Scott's special. (laughs) - What does that even look like? Two inches of regret? - Dude, I'm a five and half. - Sure. Right. Let's go with that. - And according to Cosmo, that shit is average. You're gonna help me load these into the freezer? (speaking in Spanish) - It's like that, is it? No, that's cool. That's cool. I'll just smoke this joint with my real friends. (gentle music) (upbeat hip hop music) I saw that milkshake move with Andrea. - Oh yeah? - Weak. - Dude, what are you talking about? Everybody loves milkshakes. - Nah, for real, dude. You gotta step up your game. - Do we even serve anything that a vegan can eat? - Uh, pickles? (both laughing) Shit, no, no. I love a pickle. I just, I prefer it on a slab of dead cow. (both laugh) - Later, man. I don't care what he says, everybody loves milkshakes. That was my joint.

But you know what, I'm gonna let it slide 'cause it's your big day and all that, okay? - That's right! - My sis going to Columbia. - Columbia. It looks like I got the looks and the brains of the family. Ooh, a lot of pressure on my shoulders. Gotta take care of us. - Oh, do you now? - Yes. - Hey, I'm proud of you. - Okay, who are you? - Not like I'd be caught dead with any of those nerd bombers. - Ew, nerd bombers? - But it suits you. Your whole aesthetic, very nerd bomber-esque. - You could go to college as well. Lily, Lily, Lily. Lemme tell you something. Lemme put you on game real quick, all right? There are two kinds of people in this world. There are workers. Oh, yes sir. No, sir. And they do that their whole lives. And then you got the hustlers. They be doing it for a little bit of time.

Let me fix my hair. - Girl, what do you got there behind your ear? - Nothing. What are you talking about? - Behind your ear? - JP, just... - You get some ink? - JP, not a word. - Snitches get stitches. - Uh-huh. This is cute. Come on. - Butterfly though, really? - Okay, because it's my spirit animal. - Isn't that kind of basic? (speaking in Spanish) Spirit animal? Isn't a butterfly an insect? (upbeat music) (singing in Spanish) (indistinct chatter) - Oh, look at that. Cute. Very nice. Loser. - (speaking in Spanish) (speaking Spanish) And I'm very happy to share my joy with everyone here. Lily, I couldn't be more proud of you. - Salute. - Salute. - Salute. (gentle music) - Lily, you deserve to enjoy every moment of happiness that surely lies ahead of you. And start with this one, mija. Ay, Mami! (all clapping) - It's okay, mom, really. I'm just gonna be a phone call away. Besides, JP's gonna be here. He's gonna be handling it, right JP? You promise to take care of things? (dramatic music) (door bangs) (girl screaming) - Immigration, get down! (indistinct clamoring) - Please, don't! - Show your hands! (screaming) - Hey! Lily! - Please, no... Please! No! (screaming) - This just in from the capital. Governor Finn has declared a sudden state of emergency, issuing a surprise executive order. (speaking in Spanish) - Issuing a surprise executive order commanding the task forces across the state to carry out widespread arrests of illegal immigrants, in what many are calling a blatant political ploy to galvanize his base before the upcoming gubernatorial election. - As a civil rights lawyer, but more importantly as a human being and someone's daughter, I find this executive order just atrocious. - In response to estimates that nearly two million illegal immigrants live in just his state alone... (speaking in Spanish) - Governor Finn has issued an executive order, commanding task forces to arrest the children of these immigrants as well, even if they were born here in the United States. - For aiding and abetting their parents by not reporting them to authorities. - I have only two words to say about our recent efforts to expel illegal aliens from our beautiful state. Zero tolerance. (indistinct chattering) - Single file line. No phone calls. (menacing music) - Assholes! - Stop! - Let go of me! Assholes. - Come on, let's go! Move it! - I just wanna see my family again... - Lily? Lily! Lily, it's me. It's JP. Lily! Lily! Lily! (somber music) (dog barking) (buzzer ringing) I saw you on TV. You're the one trying to get the judge to overrule the governor, right? - It's overturn. And yes. We lost. We're not done fighting yet though. We'll appeal to the Supreme Court if we have to. - How long does that take? - Hard to say. Weeks, months maybe. - This is bullshit. - Governor Finn will do everything in his power to drag this out until the election. Children of illegal immigrants aren't exactly known for voting Republican. - What? Is that a crime now? - No, but aiding and abetting an illegal alien is. - You mean being raised by my mom? What? Is my sister like an accomplice now? - Listen to me, JP. Governor Finn wants all the detained immigrants gone by election day. - Gone, like deported? They wanna deport my mom just like that? - Now, we can stop that from happening. If a natural born American citizen claims her as a member of their biological family, she'll be released. - Me and Lily, problem solved. - No. As long as you and your sister remain under state custody, you can't bring forward any legal claims. But we do have another option. (menacing music) - What's this? - The Elderly American Tolerance and Understanding project. This community service program where volunteers help care for senior citizens. The DA is offering to drop all charges if you complete this program. (menacing music) - So it's this or go to court? - Choice is yours. - No, it isn't. (upbeat music) - You all know why you're here. Successful completion of this program is your only chance to return to your normal lives and your families. - Juan Pablo Valdes. That's Valdes with an S, not a Z. Here, I'll spell that for you. G-O-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U-R-S-E-L-F. See? No Z. - Camilla Montes. (upbeat music) Full-time activist, part-time political prisoner. - What's your country of origin? - I'm a red-blooded American, but my mom is from Mexico. - While you are a participant in this program, there will be no communication with the outside world. - Chris Morales. I got chronic anxiety and delusional paranoia. Is it really hot in here? Is there even windows in here? There's no air in this room. My throat gets super dry... - There's water there if you'd like. - Dude, what's in it? LSD? Flunitrazepam. No. - One mistake. (dramatic music) And I will personally drag your ass back here. - They call me Big Mac. Know what I'm talking about? You wanna know why? 'cause I'll be macking the big hoes. The BBW. Big ladies need love too. - What's your country of origin? (speaking indistinctly) - Am I in here because I'm Latino or black? Or both? Confusing? - These ankle monitors will alert us if you're not in your assigned rooms by curfew. If it starts beeping, you have five minutes to haul ass back to your room. - Micah Fuentes, gluten-free vegan, Democrat socialist. Is that a crime yet? - What's your country of origin? - United States of Americas, Argentinian parents. But you can just write down divided states of America. - You ever been affiliated with a gang or any violent organization? - Housekeepers, landscapers, busboys, construction workers. We get together in secret, and we work the jobs that nobody else wants to do for less than minimum wage. - Ever inhaled or ingested any non commercial drugs or state-altering substances? - Zoloft. Lithium. - That's some racist shit though. To assume that I use drugs. - Clozapine, risperidone, Xanax and Adderall. - Do I assume you dance poorly to Vanilla Ice, dressed in your khaki shorts while stress eating a kale salad? - And sometimes it balances with carbamazepine and diboplorex. - Do you have a criminal record? - Of course I do. Y'all wanna know what I did? I stole hearts in the fourth grade. (laughs) - And if any of you geniuses decide to try and escape, you will enter a world of shit. (bus engine revving) (menacing music) Hello? Mr. Davis. - Please, call me Eddie. - Everyone meet Mr. Eddie Davis. Founder of the Elderly American Tolerance and Understanding project, and your supervisor for the next three months. - Thank you, Bruce. At Alcove, compassionate elder care is our mission. It's what we do. So we truly appreciate you being here to help out our seniors in so many ways, big and small, but maybe they can help you too. I mean, the truth is we all have so much to learn from our most experienced citizens. And I promise you, you stick with the program, you're gonna leave this place more mature, fully grown. You may even gain a newfound appreciation for life. I'm gonna turn you over to our operations officers, Cynthia and James. And I just wanna remind you that you are doing the residents of Alcove and your country, a tremendous service. Thank you. - All right guys, listen up. (dramatic music) I'm gonna show you guys' room, where you'll be sleeping at night. It's nothing fancy as you will see, but let's be honest. Between this and foil sleeping bags, I know which one I'd choose. You got the essentials, your bed, desk, lamp. We'll get you anything you need, just ask us. Better be in there before curfew or your ankle bracelet will go off... (indistinct chattering) - Water therapy and aqua aerobics. - Yes, the pool is heated and no, you may not use it under any circumstances. - Relaxation is big here. So no matter what happens, it's very important that the guests remain calm. The common area. This is the true heartbeat of our operation. - This is where you'll spend most of your time entertaining our guests. Your job is to play chess, read to them, blah, blah, blah. - Hey, Big Mac. Keep up. This is our garden. It's very popular with the residents. As you will see, they'll come out here to relax, close their eyes and meditate. By meditate, I just mean take a nap. Think that you'll find if you stick to the program, follow the rules and stay in line, your time here should be pretty fast and easy, all right? - Look at this. Look at this. Well, I be damned! How am I supposed to maintain my superior intellect eating this nasty ass meat loaf? Hey. Psst! White girl. White girl. - Is he talking to me? - He's talking to you. - I suggest you say something. You know, 'cause your skin. - 'Cause us white people like... - Yeah. - I'm Argentinian, (speaking Spanish). - So, you're not white? - Dude, all these old people, do we have to, like, touch them? - Do you realize how dumb you sound right now? You're gonna be old one day. - We put my grandpa in a nursing home and he loved it 'cause he got so much ass, 'cause every old lady in there was DTF. All of 'em. - Okay, you know what, we really don't wanna hear about your granddaddy fornicating right now. - Yeah, grandpa died five weeks later. And when they did the autopsy, they found like seven different STDs on him. Full head of herpes sore at the funeral like... (all laugh) No, my point is, you wanna get gonorrhea, go ahead and touch a few of these geezers. - You don't gotta touch 'em with your dick. - Um... Speak for yourself, 'cause I might want some of that fermented vagina. You know what I'm talk about? - Stop talking about old people sex. - You started it. - You know what I want? I would kill for a Lady Libs fish filet right now. - It's not fish though. - Say what? What you mean it's not fish? - What's in my filet? You don't wanna know. - That's why I'm vegan. - I only eat what my mom cooks. She's the only person I trust not to poison me. - Okay, so you're not eating that? - No, man. Or drinking. That's how they get you. - Would you all just shut up! This isn't summer camp. - What is wrong with her? She know what's in that fish filet, don't she? - All right. Time for you guys to look the part. Come on. (soft music) - Well, pick your poison. Erectile dysfunction or irritable bowel system? - It's syndrome. - Same thing. - Great. - Wow, where's my man with the... There you go. - Hey. Uh, I'm JP and I'm here with the... The program, I guess. So if you need anything or like... You... - Hey sweetie, we're here to help. - What do we do? - Here. We can read to them. Oh God, please tell me you know how to read. (JP chuckles) - No, yeah. I know how to read. I can... I could read. - That doesn't sound convincing at all. - I'll read. I know how to say words if... - Good luck. - This is stupid. Not you. Oh. Sorry. I'll just read. You know. He thought back on his family with deep emotion and love. His conviction that he would have to disappear was, if possible, even firmer than his sister's. (Greta mumbles) I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain to myself- - You will die here. - Sorry? - You will die here. - I can... I can pick another book. - You will die here. (sobs) You will die here. - Back off. Back off. You've done enough. - I was just reading a book- - Don't wanna hear it. - Doesn't... Where are you guys taking her? - Smooth. You really got a way with the ladies. - Chris, you should really eat something. - No. No way. They're not gonna break me. - At least have some water, man. You're not gonna last unless you hydrate. - I won't have to, 'cause I'm getting outta here. - What are you talking about? You trying to escape? Yeah, good luck with that. - What? (ominous music) - They're probably watching us right now. They're waiting to see if any of us have the nerve to defy them. - Who's they? - Exactly. Who are they? I don't know. You don't know. Maybe they don't even know. - You've gotta be kidding. - Do you honestly think it's crazy to try to escape? You know, I don't care if I look crazy, all right? - Oh, you sure the hell don't. - Why don't you just stop talking all this shit and go try it then? - You know, maybe I will. - No, Chris. Chris. You're a little fragile right now. You're hangry, Chris! - I don't think you should do it. - Chris. Don't do that. Don't... (alarm blaring) (taser buzzing) - Yeah, it was an accident. I tripped. I'm sorry. (taser buzzing) - Oh. (Chris whimpering) Oh, you know he pissed on himself. - Let go of me. No. No... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Moron. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (thunder rumbling) (metal clanking) (ominous music) (owl hooting) (ankle monitor beeping) (urine sloshes) (toilet flushes) (ominous music) (ankle monitor beeping) - Virgil. Will set you free. It's Virgil. Virgil. Virgil will set you free. Virgil will set you free. - Relax, it's okay. - Virgil. - It's okay. - Set you free. - Virgil. - Hey, hey, hey it's okay. - Will set you free. Free! Hey... Virgil will set you free. Virgil will set you free. Virgil will set you free. - I found her. She's here. Mrs. Wells, stop it. - All right, let's get her off of him. (JP panting) (ankle monitor beeping) - It's okay. Just come with us. Go back to your room. - Nice job, black bean. Get in your damn room. Now! Make sure her door's locked this time. (soft music) (birds chirping) - I wanna apologize for what happened to JP last night. That never shoulda happened. You guys should probably see the entire facility now. - Where's Chris? - Don't even look at me. - This is ward B. All of our residents here have been diagnosed with advanced dementia or Alzheimer's. As you can see, they tend to regress back to their natural instincts. Unfortunately, our role here is a purely palliative one. - Meaning what? - Keep 'em comfortable, spoon feed 'em, wipe their asses till they die. - That's morbid, Camilla, but not wrong. Anyway, someone left the door unlocked last night. Thus our wanderer. - Can we help them instead? - Oh, sure. You can assist James. He'll show you what to do. (Big Mac mumbles) - Why not? - Anyway, back to work everyone. - Thanks. - Kiss ass. - All right. (menacing music) Mr. Yates here, we gotta get him outta this chair and into a bed. Think you can handle that? - Yeah, sure. - Good. - So why is he strapped in? - It's for his own good. Mr. Yates here is a bit of a biter, aren't ya? Probably eat me alive. - Stupid old fuck. - Hey, don't do that. - Chill, hombre. (dramatic music) Just having some fun. - Hey man, don't call me hombre. - Don't call you what? Kid, I'll call you hombre, chico, nacho, burrito, or whatever the fuck else I wanna call you. Comprehende, amigo? - Better back off, Supercuts. - Or what? - Everything okay? - Absolutely, Eddie. Just showing JP here the ropes. All good. Welcome to my shit list, bitch. Now, help me put this old fuck to bed. Now. Get his strap. (man growls) (dramatic music) - Fuck! Get off me! Get off. Hey, hey, stop. Stop! Don't hurt him... (JP mumbling) (speaking in Spanish) Lily? Lily. (speaking in Spanish) But how? - You're not gonna believe it, (soft music) but turns out we've only been like a mile apart this whole time. (JP coughs) Hey, here. Hey JP, save your strength. Just tell me one thing. You promise to take care of things. (ground rumbling) - Hey, welcome back. - How long was I out? - About a half hour. - Feels like a lifetime. How's Mr. Mason? - I don't know, but if I'd have to guess, I'd say he's getting a lobotomy for what he did to you. - Oh, don't say that. He probably doesn't remember that he bit me. - That, or maybe you have a forgettable taste. - I taste a whole lot better with hot sauce. - Oh, okay. Well, maybe next time I'll slip him a bottle. (gentle music) - Are you finished? - Oh, yeah. I've been done with this for a while, but I'd just rather hang out here with you than spend time with James and Cynthia and the rest of those assholes. - I get what you mean. It feels like they treat the patients more like cattle than actual people. - Exactly, and it's like that's someone's abuelo or abuela. - Right. - Hey, since we're stuck here, maybe we can teach them how to treat their own. - Yeah. Yeah. Deal. - I am tired of these damn noodles. Okay? You know, I would kill for a hamburger right now. Fernando, I would choke him out for a burger right now. Murder somebody. - Guys, where's Chris? - Maybe he made his escape. Busted outta here. Flew the coop. - Wrap it up. Back to work in five. - Cynthia, have you seen Chris? - They sent him back to the detention center. - What the fuck! (menacing music) - You try to escape, that's what happens. - Look, that's a lie. - Why? - 'Cause I found this in the hallway. Look, there's no way that wheezy, half-a-lung dude would leave without this. All right? He may not be eating, but he using this. (dramatic music) (Big Mac whistling) Mr. Phillips, my main man. You know what time it is? It's movie time. Oh yeah, James says you wasn't feeling too well. So, I thought a movie might cheer you up. Plus... got you a date. Oh yeah, get your little elderly edition of Netflix and uh... don't die on me. (laughs) Y'all laughing in the inside. I ain't gonna let y'all play with me. I'm funny. I'm go ahead and hook this TV up. Is that a DVD, VCR combo? That's how they doing you, Mr. Phillips? All right. We gonna figure this out. This is a relic, but... let Big Mac go to work. (Big Mac mumbling) This is crazy. (Mr. Phillips wheezing) I don't even know where to begin. You got one of them fat backs. Oh my, what type of setup is this? I don't even... (fingers crackling) It's all right. It's all right. (Mr. Phillips wheezing) I'm a figure this out, Mr. Phillips. Don't worry about it. You know, I'll talk to James. Gotta get you a new one... Mr. Phillips? (ominous music) You okay? Mr. Phillips. Mr. Phillips' not breathing. Did you see anything what happened? (dramatic music) (Mr. Phillips rasping) (Mr. Phillips growling) No. (Mr. Phillips growling) (electricity crackling) (ominous music) (Big Mac screaming) Chill! Chill! Chill! (Mr. Phillips growling) (Big Mac screaming) (Greta screaming) - All right. I know you all must have some questions, but I gotta be honest with you guys. I don't pretend to understand what happened to Mr. Phillips, yet. The way he died is shocking and frankly incomprehensible. - Uh-uh, it ain't right. Dude last night was inside out and upside down. - What? - Yes. - The origin appears to be... - Seriously, it's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my life. - We're conducting a thorough investigation into his care, and I expect... - Man, you know where I grew up. I've seen some disturbing shit. - Big Mac. - Hm? - Care to chime in? - No, no. Um... I was just saying, man, poor, poor, Mr. Phillips. I feel bad for him. That was my guy, man. - Yeah. It's unfortunate. - Oh, Mr. Phillips. - I'll be here if anyone needs any help processing. Okay? JP, can I borrow you for a moment? (soft music) (owl cawing) Meet Virgil, not that his name really matters. - Why is that? - He's a barn owl, no more, no less. He never asks himself, "Who am I?" But rather, "What's my job?" Look over there. Tyrannus melancholicus. Charming little species. The only problem is, it's not native to the region. It's taking the jobs of the birds who are by eating the crickets and leaving less to go around. Virgil's job, aside from eating and one day being eaten, is to maintain order. But he can't do it alone. He does his part, trusting that those just like him are doing the same. Let's say he's the gatekeeper of Alcove both inside the facility and out. But unlike Virgil, I don't have eyes in the back of my head. So I have to trust that the two of you are doing your jobs and not letting anything, a stupid fight, to pick a hypothetical example, get in the way. My entire business hangs on this trust. Am I wise to invest this trust in you? - Yeah. - Yes. - Great. I'll let you two hug it out. - Hug? Truce? - Okay. - I'm gonna make your life a living hell. - Shh, shh, shh. Don't kill the vibe. - What are you doing? Fuck, man. Jesus Christ. (menacing music) Pendejo. - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh... (JP laughs) (JP groans) (upbeat hip hop music) (JP chuckles) ♪ It's Big Mac and the haters after me ♪ ♪ I only like big chicks to eat hot calories ♪ You know what, I'm not even ashamed of this. I'm a thug. I punch people in the face. - No. Yeah, I know. - You mind just giving me a minute. Do you mind just... Let me get myself. Hey, hey. You ain't gon' tell anybody, right. - You good. - You ain't gon'... Wait, wait, wait. That don't sound too believable. That don't sound too... (JP laughs) (soft knocking) - Pool party. What do you say? - Almost done with curfew check. - Get in! Ooh, thanks. - No problem. - Gotta say, did not peg you as a trouble-making type. - Mm-mm. Troublemakers get caught. - So you're just a bad boy? For who, I wonder. Turn around. Hey, if she were into girls, I'd try to hit that too. - Oh, yeah? - Then again, maybe I could change your mind about that. Relax, bro. I'm not gonna stand in your way. (both laugh) (loud knocking) - JP, what are you doing here? It's way past curfew. - Care for a swim? (singing in foreign language) - She called you a what? - A six. - Wow. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. She's clearly tripping. - Thank you. - You're a four at best. - Come on. - At best. - Seriously? - At best. - Oh, wow. Come on. (speaking in Spanish) What's that? - (speaking in Spanish) I mean, you never heard of it? - What does it mean? - No, it's not... It's like when all of your senses come together in a perfect way. Hey, look, I'll show you. Close your eyes. Close 'em. How does that smell? - Like brandy. - No. Come on, try harder. - Fruits. Cherries. - Yeah, very good. How does that feel? - Smooth. - How does that sound? - Sounds soft. Very soft. - Open your eyes. How do I look? - Beautiful. Well, there's only one sense left, JP. - Taste. (speaking in Spanish) Si. (singing in foreign language) So, are we gonna do this? - Oh, yeah. I mean, that is if you want to. - Uh, yeah. Very, very much. (singing in foreign language) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (JP gasps) Fuck! Jeez! - Ms. Wilcox. What are you doing in here? Come here, let me help you. Gotcha. You're not supposed to leave your room. I was so scared when I went in there and you weren't there. I'll get you back. (JP laughs) (gentle music) - You smashed Micah last night, didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you? You did. - That's right. - Okay. Respect. Respect. Respect. Did not know you had that type of game, baby. - Hey, now you know. - Okay. I know. I know. Now, tell me this. Tell me this. Tell me this. How much of a freak was she? How much was a... (JP laughs) I'm gonna tell like three people, but I ain't gonna tell nobody else. - All right, I'll tell 'em about that face mask though. - Okay. Okay. All right. That's our secret to the death. To the death. (menacing music) She nasty. I like that. I'm gonna need to know more detail though. I tell you that. What's up? - Give me a sec. (ominous music) Hey, Greta. Hi. It's gonna sound weird, but did anyone give this to you? Yeah, no? See, my sister, she used to make the exact same cootie catchers back at home. Her name was Lily. Do you know her? (ominous music) (dramatic music) Okay. (Greta whimpering) - Let go of him. Let go! - Let go. - Let's transfer her to ward B. Been a long time coming. (dramatic music) - Hey, what's wrong? What happened? - No, I'm fine. I just... I think there's something wrong with Greta. - Well, clearly there is, or else she wouldn't be here. Don't take it too personally. - I don't know why she keeps freaking out on me. - All right. It's official. These people are fucked up! But you know what's really fucked up? Last night was crazy. I totally blacked out. - It makes two of us. After the pool, I don't remember anything. And on top of that, I'm dying out here. - Wait a second. - Back off, creep. - No, just look. You got a weird mark on the back of your neck. Just look. (intense music) - Oh. Oh, that look like a terrible hickey. - Yeah. - Might be those needles that they're always using. - Wait, do you remember being sedated? - Isn't the point of being sedated that you don't remember? There's some strange shit going on around here. (dramatic music intensifies) (upbeat music) - That's not how I would describe it. - All right. Well then, how would you describe it? - It's not a scam if you're getting paid. - Cynthia, you're paid to get into it. - You think you're so much smarter than me. You have to start somewhere. Right now I'm just at the bottom. - Of the pyramid... (dramatic music intensifies) (man snoring) - You're sure about this? - We can't have her freaking out all the time. Let's just double her dosage and make our lives easier. - All right. Let's go. - I can't wait till she's gone. Just a matter of days at this point. (dramatic music) What? - Did you hear that? (JP panting) - No, it's probably nothing. - I dunno. - Come on. I hate this job. (ominous music) (dramatic music) - You will die here. You will die here. - Holy fuck! Oh, shit. (dramatic music intensifies) - Have y'all seen JP? - Cynthia told me he's been on kitchen duty all morning. - No, that was me. Why do you think your lunch is so irresistibly delicious, huh? - Your hands are blessed. Anointed. - What can I say? I'm talented. - (Big Mac chuckles) JP missin' out. - Wait. Well, we know they're lying to us about Chris, right? What about JP? - You know what? I got a idea. (dramatic music) - All right, Camilla. You stay guard. - Why do I have to stay on guard? - I'll freak out if anybody shows up. Plus, you think better on your feet. - That's blatant flattery. But okay, I'll bite. - If you see anyone coming, just give us a sign. - What kinda sign? - A bird call. - A bird call, really? - Yes, like ca caw, ca caw. - Come on, I can't even think of anything more obvious. - That's not obvious. - Do you see birds? - There's a lot of birds. - Guys, when he comes out, just fucking go. Go! - Ca caw, ca caw, that's it. - No. - Yes, it is. - Damn. Okay, what are we even looking for? - Anything with Chris or JP's name? This is nice. - Okay. I guess I'll look over here. - This middle drawer's locked. (ominous music) There's gotta be a key somewhere. - You know, maybe we should just get outta here. - Ah, I found one. - That is not a key. - But it is. And no, I don't know how to do this just because I'm black. My father was a locksmith. - Thank you so much for that clarification. - Yeah. I can hear you judging me. Give me a second. A little rusty, but... (Big Mac chuckles) Got it. Oh, yeah. What is this? - What is that? - It looks like a machine or something like that. Oh. (menacing music) - Fuck! Hey, James. Just who I wanted to see actually. - What is it? - Here's Chris. - Wait, look. - Solitary? The fuck! - James, so do you like... - What happened to the ca caw? - Okay, we gotta go. - He hasn't been eating. Just go spoonfeed him some tuna or something. - Dude, I just wanna know- - Camilla, be quiet and go, now. (intense music) What do we have here? All right. So James, what's it like to run a summer camp for wetbacks? Oh yeah, it's great. Everything I ever wanted. Fuck this place, man. - That dude is crazy. - I don't know. Let's just get outta here. (metal clanging) - Oh, shit! Fuck! (menacing music) - Oh my God! (machine whirring) - Hey, where are we? What's going on? Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to you guys? - What'd you guys find out? - I found some crazy shit. - Oh, these fuckers are up to something, aren't they? (Big Mac muttering) - But I'm calling it, Freemasons. No, no, no, no. Lizard, no. No! The Illuminati! - Stop talking like Chris and tell me what happened. - Matter of fact, actually, poor Chris- - Hey, Mac. (ominous music) Help me out with something. - No problem. - Come on. - Thank you. (metal rattling) - You hear that? It's coming from the vent. Screw must be loose. Fix it before dinner. (ominous music) - Fix it before dinner. I'm onto you, James. I'm onto you. (upbeat music) (metal clanging) - Crap! It's cool. I got it. - Guess he think the Mac man can do everything. You know what? I can do everything, James. I'm built for this. - Oh, shit! Where'd he go? - Got all this money round here, ain't got no maintenance man? (dramatic music) (man growling) (Big Mac screaming) - Big Mac. - Get back. Everyone. - Somebody call an ambulance. - Nobody's calling anyone. Now, get back. We will handle this. (ominous music) - James, you there? We need some help down here right away. - Sending someone right away. You, go find Bruce. (ominous music) - Looks like those commercials are working. Product's selling well. - Keep your voice down. - You ever tried one? - Have I? Are you out of your goddam mind? Eddie, don't tell me you- - No! But the kids have. - They tell the difference? - Apparently, they taste just like the real thing. Steak, meatballs, chilli dogs, sloppy joes. - (laughs) Tacos. (ominous music) - Open the door. Quick, quick. Three, two, one. Go back to the lab. We'll deal with him now. - He's not responding. - Shit! Eddie's gonna kill us. - What do we do? - There's only one thing to do. We're gonna jumpstart his system and inject him with adrenaline. - No, no, no. We'll just wake him up. (menacing music) (intense music) - He's the gatekeeper of Alcove both inside and outside the facility. - Virgil will set you free. - Fuck! (intense music) - JP's gone. I repeat, I cannot find JP. (JP panting) - Talk to me about production. - Well, the supply of raw materials is going better than expected. We'll never run out at this rate. - And the kids? Any discipline issues? - Nothing to worry about. The sedatives keep the kids in check. We also lace 'em with highly effective hormones, tenderizing their bodies by more than 20%. - So how's it working? The machine. - The prototype produces twice the number of patties in half the time of your average assembly line. We have more product than we know what to do with. - And the results are the same across all 12 of our facilities. (machine whirs) We have a commercially reliable product that's safe to eat, tastes just like the real thing. And best of all, all production costs are covered by John Q taxpayer. - Hm! Damn! (laughs) - JP. What's going on? What are you doing? - Micah. They did this to me. We gotta run before they do it to everyone. - My God. What happened to you? - Don't get any fucking closer. (JP mutters) - Sorry, dude. For the record, we never happened. I don't fuck the help. - Don't be afraid. Fear releases adrenaline, stiffens the muscles. Spoils the meat. - You're a fucking cannibal. - Oh, come on. I don't eat the burgers. - Fuck you. - I'm not a cannibal, JP. I'm an American. Something you'll never really be. People like you cry supremacy. I call it manifest destiny. One nation, all our own. How's my little spy doing tonight? - Hungry. - You know, JP, we used to need people like you. To pick our crops, sew our clothes, build our cities, and yes, wipe the asses of our elders. And boy, did you all deliver. I mean, how else do you explain the world we live in? Where you can buy virtually anything from anyone, anywhere and have it delivered to your doorstep before breakfast. That doesn't just happen, JP. It's by design. (upbeat music) Ask your lawyer. (singing in foreign language) She knows. It's all thanks to people like you. Doing jobs that nobody wants for basically nothing. And for that... I say gracias. But look to the future, JP. This is progress. Automation. We don't need your cheap labor anymore. You're obsolete. And frankly, you've been consuming more than you've been contributing lately. So for the good of my people, you'll now supply the only thing you have left to offer. (menacing music) (ominous music) - Ca caw! Ca caw! - If you try to escape, you'll be sent back to the detention center. - Do not test us. We have eyes in the back of our heads. Curfew is mandatory and non-negotiable. (ominous music) - Relaxation's a big thing here, so no matter what happens... (glass shatters) (intense music) - Don't apologize for your privilege. That's what Eddie says. You know, I used to fear my power. I know you won't believe it. But I used to feel like I didn't deserve it. Until I met Eddie. - Lily. What did you do to my sister? - She's alive. Not for long. Started drugging her the moment she got here. Promise you. Anti-anxiety meds dissolved in the water. Chris was right about that. Triggering night terrors, paranoia, violent hallucinations. That one's my favorite. Next, we add hormone to the mix. Converting lean muscle to tender meat. That's hard work on your body. Your bones weaken, dementia sits in, as you become slow, confused, disoriented. The perfect livestock. All the while, your season salted and tenderized to perfection. Extreme aging wasn't an expected byproduct of the hormones, but fuck, it turned out to be the perfect cover, because no one wants to look at old folks too close. Age is disgusting. Stick grandma in a home and forget about her, right? And no, you won't die peacefully in bed from natural causes because buried deep within our genes is like this reflex. A final gasp of rebellion where your body just destroys itself and everything else in its way. A surge of violence before your body shuts down to let us know that your body's ready for the process. There's a natural order to this world, and we're just here to enforce it. - Here at Lady Liberty's, we like to keep things simple. We serve the best tasting burgers at the lowest prices, period. Like our baby blues burger. Available now from 5.99. Made for our people by our people. The same low price as the big fancy chains. - Psst! Hey. Camilla. - Oh, shit. - Not now. You don't look too good yourself, okay? - I remember the small town I grew up in. - Where's Big Mac? - No one knows. I just know he tried to escape too. - We gotta get outta here. I mean... There's not much time. - Till what? - Until they come in here, take you, take me and churn us into some... (elevator dings) - Family, duty, self-reliance, hard work. So long as I am your governor... - After dinner. That's when we make our move. I'm Harper Percy Finn. And I'm asking you, remember who we are. - Remember who we are. Remember who we are. Remember who we are... - Hello? Hi. Lily. (soft music) It's me. It's JP. Your brother. You remember? You remember mom? Amelia? Remember the woman who growled at me for throwing water balloons at the quinceanera? You remember. There you are. (speaking in Spanish) I'm gonna get us out of here. I'm a figure it out, I promise. (owl hooting) - Well, well. Looks like someone's having trouble sleeping. - Yeah, I think I can help with that. (ominous music) (glass clanging) - You little bitch! - What the fuck! - All right. All right, you've had your fun. - All right, you old fucks, back to bed. - Last chance. - All right, what do we do now? (glass shattering) - Hey! Get back here! Son of a bitch! (door slams) (metal clanging) (Bruce growling) (JP screaming) (indistinct clamoring) - Let go of me. - Get the fuck off me! (glass shattering) - It's crazy down there. It's like the elderly version of 300. I been crawling through the vent like I'm black Bruce Willis. (dramatic music) (Bruce growling) (Bic Mac screaming) (Big Mac heaving) JP... I got pee on my hands. Don't tell nobody. (alarm blaring) (menacing music) We gotta go. We gotta go. Come on. Come on. - Hey, Big Mac. - What's up? - Thanks, man. - You're welcome. You're welcome. (dramatic music) (intense music) (indistinct clamoring) - These old people are savages, man. - I got her. (elevator dings) (soft elevator music) (elevator beeps) Where the hell are we going? (elevator dings) - I'm gonna find another way out. Stay here. (speaking in Spanish) Can I count on you to stay with her? - I'm an asshole, JP, not a quitter. Go! (dramatic music) - Ca caw, motherfuckers. Let's blow this bitch. Let's go! (all cheering) (upbeat music) (energetic music) (woman panting) (car engine revving) (ominous music) - Excuse me. Um... Hey, can I use your phone real quick? (woman screaming) (car engine revving) Okay, no wow! Oh, it's 'cause I'm black? Or because I got all these old people with me. Is that right? - JP, just... (dramatic music) JP! - Chris? - I tried to warn you guys. - Chris, you're alive. - Look what they've done to... (dramatic music) (glass shatters) - I gotta say, I admire you, kid. You know, it doesn't feel that way right now. Nobody's ever made it this far before. You should be proud, and all you had was hope. But hope doesn't change things, JP. Power does. (gears clanging) You step up to take care of your people, just like I take care of mine. It's nothing personal, JP. Just progress. (ominous music) - Come on. Are you good? - Uh-huh. - Let's get you outta here. (dramatic music) - Bitch. (metal clanging) - No! (Chris growling) (gentle music) - Hey. Hey, get up. Come on. I got you. Let's go. (machine whirring) (somber music) (Big Mac laughing) - Oh, we did it. JP? JP! JP! JP! (somber music) (dramatic music) - This is a pivotal hour in the immigration showdown, as researchers discover how a madman has taken advantage of a broken system for his own depraved agenda. - Amidst damning evidence, authorities have shut down Governor Finn's Lady Liberty burger chain. Meanwhile, the governor himself appears to have fled the country. As researchers scramble for a way to reverse the damage Mr. Davis and his co-conspirators have done, the state legislature has agreed to a suspension of the executive order which set all of this into motion. (speaking in Spanish) - Allowing for the immigrants to be reunited with their loved ones. - Psst! (upbeat music) - Did you just psst me? Oh, y'all playing games. That's what we doing right now? Oh, you think it's a game? (laughs) Y'all think this is funny? - Oh, no, it's too easy. - Y'all playing games with my emotions right now. Y'all see me! (Big Mac stammers) Fuck the both of y'all, all right? I'm outta here. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't be like that. - No! - Come back, Mac. Come on. Come back. - Come back? Come back. You almost gave me a heart attack. - We were taking a nap. We were tired. - We literally just saw a guy get turned into a burger. - You know what? Come on. Come on. Let's go. You're lucky I respect my elders. Come on, get your ass up. Oh, look at that. Arthritis. Ain't that a bitch? Uh-huh. Come on, old lady. That hip is gonna be replaced...
