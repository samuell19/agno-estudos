Even after living for 35 years in U.S., whenever I come to lndia... ...I don't know why, but I feel very excited. I feel as though l've come to the warmth of my mother's lap. Today... ...my lndia may have something to offer, or not, but she has... ...one thing in abundance, and that is love. The air here... ...the buildings here, echo with one word - Love. One such building is... The Taj Mahal. My American friends... in U.S., Love means give and take. But in lndia it means give, give and give! And there comes another unbelievable thing... - How is your family? - My wife is very peeved with you. This time I'll make it up to her. You've become a big-wig now. You last come to us 10 years ago! - My kids are dying to meet you. - I'm packing off this lot. I'll accompany you to Dehra Dun and spend 3-4 days with your kids. Put your window up, friend. It's getting dusty inside. We've grown up in this dust... ...so how can we stop it from coming in? The scent of this dust from lndia is out of this world. For 35 years you've been living in the U.S., but you haven't changed. You must be the first lndian to have earned so much money and fame there. You're coming to my house after exactly 10 years! We sold our house at Dehra Dun and built a house amidst our land. My brother lives in the city. My mother, wife and I live here. Since it's vacation time, it's full house at home. Kulvanti and her kids are here, too. And they're all awaiting you... ...as though some film star from Mumbai is expected! See! we're caught right here. This is Ganga, my daughter. The same. Our little Kusum. - Look who's here, dear. - Don't tell me. Let me guess... You're American-uncle, Dad's friend. 25 years ago... No! 35 years ago, you went there with Rs. 10,000 in hand. Today you're rich! You've a huge family with 18 sons, 11 daughters... 9 daughters-in-law, 3 sisters, 3 brothers, cars and helicopters too! And which is that city, Dad? You live in Hollywood... ...where all the American movie stars live. And your bungalow is... Won't you touch his feet and pay your respects? - Bless you. - this my son... - I'll go tell Mom. - Tell her what? - They're all activated as it is. - What happened? Come along atleast. A royal welcome awaits you. - Madam... - What is it, damn you! Master is here with his American friend. - What do you mean? He's here?! - What! He has come? Today? Somebody get my chunni Get aside, will you? - Did you have to sit here only? - Come, friend... - Wow! What a lovely farm-house! - My chunni, kids! Hurry! - Is that American here? - He's here, sis. How are you? This is height of shamelessness. I'm going... - Namaste... - Namaste... - Honestly! You didn't tell me... - So what? I'm no stranger. - True, but... - Good you came. We were expecting you tomorrow. Anyway, now that you're here, welcome. - I hear you're a big-wig now. - For you, I'm the same little boy. I need your blessings, in fact. So... - But how can I bless you, son? - Why not? Cow-dung! They are Nitin, Sonali, Daksha, Dabboo... That N.R.I. is being fussed over as though he's God! That Surajdev has an complex about foreign countries! - I know him for 10 years! - You are an N.R.I. too. - Why don't they fuss over you? - They will, my dear. They will. - You'll see. - When, Dad? When? When he'll come with a proposal for his daughter Ganga. When will he do that? Years have gone by... - Then fix it once and for all. - Fix it? Without deciding dowry? You're pretty silly. I've educated this boy, made him a body-builder. - What for? - Then go and meet them. A variety of gourmet dishes have been made for this richie-rich! Wow! What a delicious dinner. I used to return from Delhi and Mumbai. But the fruits and vegetables of rural lndia are unique. And why not? When they're from the fields of the Sun God! This is Amirchand. My mother's sister-in-law's, sister's son! Why don't you say a distant-cousin? Sir, I'm Amirchand, my brother Garibchand, and my wife Bhagyashri. - He's an N.R.I. too. - Which country do you come from? Not now. He used to live in Sri Lanka. So what? An lndian coming from Sri-Lanka is an NRl, too! We're small people. Variety of rich dishes are laid out for you. We're not even invited! Amirchand, come here and open your complaints book. - My respects, Aunty. - Right. How are you? Uncle. Take your medicine for the evening. My dose? You're to take your dose everyday at 7 p.m. and 9 a.m. - 9 a.m., 7 p.m... - Who told you? - Tell me. Who told you. - I was ironing your overcoat... ...a slip fell out from it. It said what you are to eat... And also what not to. It was signed Arjun. - This is his work, eh? - Who's this Arjun? He's my 18th son. Son of my distant sister. He sees to my every personal need. I call him my Little Master. He has penned a lovely song. I Love India... Have your dose first then go on about I love lndia Aunty, why is our Ganga... ...buttering that man so much? You always smell of jealousy! Here, have some water. This uncle can take us to U.S.A. - How? - If we impress him, that is. But how? - You ass... - Ass? With our music. That too English music. Idiot! He's an out and out lndian American. If you try to impress him, it'll backfire! - Shall we bet on it? - Done! One moment. Do you remember our song's English notes? London, I saw... I saw Paris... I saw London, I saw Paris, and I saw Japan... I saw Michael, I saw Elvis... I've seen it all, my loves There isn't another lndia in the whole of the world There isn't another lndia anywhere in the world The world is a bride... The world is a bride... and this is the dot that adorns her forehead That is what my lndia is... I love my India... The world is a bride... And lndia is the dot that adorns her forehead That is what my lndia is... I love my India... It took the soulful tune... to bring the rains It set the waters on fire... such were the notes of the Raag Deepak A confluence of the seven notes... it's the essence of life We even give our God the name of the One with the Flute The Lord with the Flute Such is my lndia... I love my lndia The cuckoo tweets sweetly And the nightingale sings In times of joy and sadness... we have created the songs of life The world sings our songs... Songs that carry the fragrance of our soil India, my land... I love my India India, I do my deeds for... India, my duties are for The world... is a bride... And lndia is the dot that adorns her forehead That is what my lndia is... I love my India... India, I do my deeds for... India, my duties are for You can't be serious! I am very much serious. For my son Rajiv... ...I'm asking your daughter's hand in marriage. Look. Rajiv's mother died 3 years back. You know Rajiv is my only son. He was born and brought up there. He hasn't seen lndia as yet. But he definitely knows the hearts... ...and the thoughts of his lndian parents, and he respects them. I'm asking your daughter's hand because... ...we N.R.I.s need girls like her very badly. Because we've pushed our kids so deeply in English books and manners That somewhere or the other, even after seeing so much success... ...we feel as though we're failures. And seeing all this... ...today, girls like Ganga are our only source of hope. That's why l've decided that by making her my son's wife... ...I'll take her from this house, to that house. But by asking you with folded hands. What nonsense! The fact that she will go into such a loving family... ...is so comforting. There's just one hitch... - We're village folks... - Don't make such cheap remarks. You know me well, don't you? Leave the rest for later. I'll phone you from America. No! A girl whom I don't send to Delhi or Mumbai... ...I'll allow to go to America? Never! Try to understand. Vices depend on one's upbringing Not the nation. And America's not far. How times have changed! You'll send her to America? - Make her a foreigner? - Oh come on, mother... Today the whole nation is westernised. And Ganga has graduated in English. Look at our own kids. All twenty-four hours... ...they watch musical channels which show Michael Jackson! Don't be adamant about it. I've given my word to my friend. We had given our word to that Amirchand too, for his son. No... we hadn't given any word to Amirchand. We had said we'd think about it. And that son of his... ...he drinks heavily. Then go and talk to him. They are under that impression. So let them be! My Ganga will marry my friend's son. And that's my final decision! How can you decide by yourself? You should've thought about it. You should've taken some advice. Enough! Ganga will marry my friend's son, and that's that! American uncle has gone, but he left some snaps... ...of his family and son Rajiv. Really? Show us... No! But your father doesn't know which is Rajiv's photograph. What! Yes, because he forgot to ask and uncle forgot to tell! Show me then. Hands off! I'll tell you. I'll show you... First of all the family. This is American uncle with his brother. This is his sister-in-law. Looks strict! This is Padma, his sister. She's fashionable. And this is his mother, Krishna. A wholesome mother. Now the confusion sets in. There are 2 heroes! And you've to guess which one is Ganga's! Show me atleast. I'll show you. Now the first hero. Now, the second one. Now you have to guess which of the two here... ...is her hero! Yes. Go ahead and guess. Take your time, sis. Shall I tell you? I say it's this one! And I say... ...sister's hero is this one! Sis... ...you guess which of the two is Rajiv. Shall I show you? Yes, go on. Yes, show us... My respects. Be happy. Did you call me? Yes I did. Is it true... ...that you've asked your friend's daughter's hand in marriage? Yes. And l've also given him my word. Good. But Kishorilal... ...do you know this too, that you're trying to bring... ...India's pure Ganges to these concrete jungles of America? I know it. But how about our future generation? Our lndian culture? Who will preserve it for us? Rajiv will never agree to it. He'll never. Our sons don't like to visit lndia, how will they choose an lndian girl? They are westernised, and for them to marry lndian girls? lmpossible! I'll make the impossible possible. And my Arjun. My Little Master. I shall meet you some day But I wonder when you will shower your love on me For, my heart thirsts... it is lonely Walk out of that picture, and come to me, my love My love... Arjun Sagar, is one of U.S.A.'s, Canada's and U.K.'s... ...upcoming artists whose song, I Love My lndia... ...is topping the Asian Music Chart. Let's now meet him. How did you come from lndia to the U.S.A.? By Air-lndia! Actually, l... I was born in a town called Mathura. - The town of Lord Krishna? - Yes, that's right. But I'm not Krishna, I'm Arjun. That too, from these modern times. Actually, I was 10 years old when my parents died. My father was a musician, and my mother, a school teacher. I was just living a life of an orphan, when Kishorilal... ...who was like a brother to my mother, came into my life. - Then? - Then I came to America, and... ...I worked in a garage for 3 years. Plied a taxi for 4 years. And then Kishorilal made me a manager in his own garage. Today he's my father... ...deity, God... everything! When he came to know that I love singing and dancing... ...he built a work-studio for me. Where we do our work... ...and our rehearsals too. - Any regrets? - No. - Any siblings? - No. - Any relations? - No. - A Beloved? - Only in songs. - Ever loved anyone? - Never! Why is that? - Never found one. - Who's your dream-girl? An lndian girl... I don't really know. Because she's in my mind... In paintings. I haven't met her. How long have you been away from lndia? 5 years. Your future plans? It's only to... ...raise my father's house in Mathura and build a music school. Where poor kids can come, and... Yes Rajiv? Where are you? Daddy wants you. Go home now. Has he called me now? He has chosen an lndian girl for me! That's why he wants you. Has he called me alone? Don't worry. I'll meet him. Else, he'll parcel me to lndia! Just one last question. - Sorry, but l've to go. - It's an important question. Look, didn't I just tell you that nobody is an important as Kishorilal? Not even me! Arjun, Rajiv has never gone to lndia... ...and nor does he want to! But I want him to go there. To breathe the fragrance there... To understand the values there. And choose the Ganga there. To agree to marry her with all his heart. Just think that this is my life's most important... ...and beautiful dream. Which only you can fulfill for Rajiv is your friend, and... No, Daddy. Don't you worry. I promise you. Rajiv will agree to marry Ganga! Give Monica 5 days leave. Take that as an order from me. Who sent these flowers? That friend of yours... I sent them, sir. Welcome, welcome. How do you like them? They're beautiful, and... I also know why you've sent them. Advocating for Daddy, are you? I know l've to go to lndia with you. Look around... Approve the girl and... You know everything... Daddy did one good thing. He gave me the right to choose. Meaning? He left the choice to me! Come and see lndia once atleast. You'll like it very much. I knew you'd join us too. So, I booked 3 tickets to Delhi. By Air-lndia! Why Air-lndia? Sis! Sis! We got the information. Sis! What is it? We got the news! What news? Who's to be your husband. Who? You won and he lost. Yes, I did lose. Here's your prince RajiV's photo... ...who is coming here on Monday! O Holy Ganges... Why are you going away to an alien land? Why must you leave your own land Where are you going, Ganga? You're breaking a promise... You're leaving us behind Where are you going, Ganga? You're breaking a promise... You're leaving us behind My love, my beloved... I live, where my beloved does I shall be, where my husband is He has made me leave my country He has called me to a foreign land He has sent word for me I live, where my beloved does I shall be, where my beloved is What am I to do, Lord? I live, where my beloved does I shall be, where my beloved is I feel something snapping in my heart I leave my adolescence in my father's home I'm happy... and yet, I am sad Like a river that is thirsty What am I to do, Lord? I live, where my beloved does I shall be, where my beloved is That silver bowl... and the golden plate Give it to me, Mom... My mother-in-law calls me Those cosmetics and the adornments... Hurry up and give it to me, mom... My husband is calling me What is it? Get up! Your prince is here. What! Yes. Come and see. No. I don't want to. Come on... see for yourself. Ram hasn't come, but Krishna has! What are you talking about? Rajiv is still in Delhi. He has sent some Arjun to see to things. What? Look, uncle... Try to understand what I'm saying. Rajiv is totally American. He will not stand this heat and dust. And the stink! If something stinks... I mean, he'll go mad! Do you know what'll happen if he comes here? He'll faint! He'll faint first, then come to his senses and just fly off! No. We're with you. Last night Kishorilal told me everything. So now do as I tell you. First remove these cows from here. The buffaloes, son. Whatever. Then send these goats away some place. Now this... does he bite? No. Just barks. You'll have to shift him because Rajiv is allergic to dogs. Is this cot for the dog? That cot... It's our servant's cot. No, no. He can't sleep here. Build a servant quarter for him. Everything must've its own set up. Uncle, you do follow me, don't you? We must clean up this place fast! This straw here... It's cow-dung, son. Ramu... that's your name, right? Just throw this out at once. Son, Kishorilal... Not him; talk about the son. He won't stand all this, so, it's vital that we clean up. Pompous, isn't he? Tells us to oust our dog! Asks Ramu to sleep out. Is he a human or a beast? I'll turn this beast into a man pretty soon. How? l've a remedy for it. What will you do? What idea? Says our Ganga... You are? Daksha, a cousin. Good. Sit down please. And you? Shake hands atleast... I'm the brother... only one. Please stand here. Where's Ganga? Didn't see her. Come in, Sis... Don't remove your glasses. I'm really Ganga. So then... that is... you are chosen by Daddy for Rajiv? Yes, when uncle saw me, he said he won't find such... ...Lovely Ganga in the whole of lndia! Isn't that so? Sure. Daddy was right! We won't find a girl like you... ...in this whole world, let alone lndia. Is there a... te... telephone here? Will you let me talk to Rajiv? I'll certainly not do that. I'll just talk to Daddy. Come along... Not you. You sit right here. Book a call please. Yes... ' Lightning' call will do. Yes, I know it costed 8 times more. Charge 16 times more, even 32... ...but I must get the call through. Let the lines be down or not... its matter life or death.. Even if they are down try and put this call... What the hell are you doing? No, I don't mean you... - Go sit there, please. - Let me talk to Rajiv... I can't do that. Go and sit now. Sit her there and see that she does! Stay here... No Madam, I'm back. Look Madam, have pity on me. I had told you, you won't get a line for 4 hours. Is there any secluded place here? Yes. I want to be left alone. I don't want to be disturbed And the moment the call comes through, call me. - Fine. There's a problem... Yes, put me through. Kishorilal? How are you? No, I didn't phone you. Arjun is here and Rajiv is coming tomorrow. We're all fine. I'll just call her. Ganga, my dear... Yes, Papa? Your phone. Who's calling? It's an important call. From? Guess. Tell me, Papa. Kishorilal uncle. Really? Let me talk to him. Uncle? This is Ganga here. My respects... I'm fine. Oh uncle! How will I not remember you? And that song of yours... We all sing it. It's a superhit. Even Grandma sings it! Yes? And how are you? Do you take your medicine on time? Your Little Master is here. He's okay. A bit pompous... No, uncle. He's nice. Okay, I'll give it to him. Yes, go on... Everything's fine. That soap in your room... Keep it as I told you to. This is... Ganga. And that one then... A trick. You may go. Daddy, you were right. I'm... My name is... I know. You're Arjun. Rajiv's friend. You have come to see me and my home. I'm sorry. My entry was a bit mistimed. All good people admit their error, and apologise at once. I'll say that all the good people in this world... ...forgive those, who apologise. Your face shows that you've forgiven me. And your smile says that we must become friends soon. And your hand says we must shake hands soon. Right? A firm friendship? Yes. Absolutely? Sure. Every relation in this house is bound with bond of love. Whether it's with an animal, or between a servant and his master. To form new relationships we don't break old ones! Do you have any shame, or not? Forgot the rules set here? It seems he's not fixing your betrothal... ...but you're confirming his! My dear... Whatever Arjun's doing is for your own good. Imagine that he's a film director. Who is planning to get the hero and the heroine together. Rajiv is coming tomorrow. In his honour, l've invited... ...the elite of the city. So don't do any mischief tomorrow. Am I not here to break the legs that you're standing on! How will you? And why? As if you were never little. You too must've been naughty then. Don't laugh! You'll grow old too. Now everything is fine between us. We know each other... I just wish to explain one thing. Think anything you like about me. Rajiv's servant, his cutlery... His friend, brother, anything! But there's one thing. A boy like Rajiv is hard to find in this whole world, let alone U.S. He's out of this world. ...he's mind blowing! Today too, he'll come in a special car in such great style... ...our American Prince. He's here. Who? Your dear prince from Delhi His car had a 4-tyre flat. He coming in a chariot. Welcome to lndia, son-in-law. Welcome to lndia. All the guests are here. Your father has invited so many people. Raju must be nervous. Meet the Asst. Police Commissioner of our area, Mr. Yadav. Bless you... it's all right. So... If you have a problem, call me. What problem with you around, sir? I mean if anyone is to be pulled up. I just jailed a minister, you see. What goes on here? Nothing. Come, have some snacks. Pay your respects, son. Not mine, this gentleman's. Bless you... Cool? You're feeling cold with a coat on? No. Cool means fine, thanks. Why thank? O, wifey... Right here. Come dear, let's go. In Punjab they hit you like this, and show their affection. The chair, sir! Chair, sir, I say! He doesn't know Hindi you see. Say Chair. Go to hell! Baba, someone has cast an evil eye on him. Ever since he's here... ...his health has been bad. Give him a remedy for it. He's just warding off evil spirits. Try to understand. He too is having the same problem. So please... Just once... No, no. I'm fine... This is Love from lndia! Shall we sit down? How is he? Shall I tell you the truth? He's like a prince! Sweet. Where's Ganga. I'll just go and see. What's wrong? Why the delay? Where's Ganga? Getting ready. Dressing up in finery... There she comes now. How am I looking? Wonderful! Didn't I say that when I get ready, you'll just gawk! Sure. - lsn't she looking beautiful? - Sorry, but she resembles an ape! Try to understand. Rajiv hates such heavy ornaments. He's American and likes simplicity. But this is lndian simplicity. No! I'll show you simplicity. Hold this, and you come with me. Take this off and why did you wear these gold ornaments? What will you have? Tea, juice? I'll prefer tea. Will you have tea, too? How much sugar? Just one spoon. Two more. Two more?...Two. Okay, one more. One more. Do one thing, add the whole lot. The whole lot? You're pretty smart! Rajiv... How did you like Ganga? Let me sleep. My head is aching! Okay then, shall l... consider her for myself? You haven't told me how did you find Rajiv? You didn't tell me either. Did you like him, or not? Liked him not. Tell me. You tell me. No, you first. Tell me... You tell me. Okay, I'll tell you. I think you didn't like Rajiv at all. When did I say that? So! You like him, eh? Dad, it's bad. Surajdev called everyone, but us. He got scared you may not spoil his daughter's chances. I don't spoil chances, I stop them. And what if they get engaged? Then? We'll break it. Surajdev, let my good days come. Then I'll show you. Where are you going? To give milk to Rajiv. Give it here. Ganga, go give this to Rajiv. Me? Yes! Take it, I said. Hurry up. Why her, and not me? Arjun said... ...Ganga will give him the milk today. In our country a snake is not considered as an animal, but God. You have your milk and sleep. Nothing will happen. You? I want to meet you... ...in private. Why in private? Well, won't it be better if we chat a bit? So let's chat. Not here. Then where? In those fields. Behind the wind-mill. May I ask my mother? Can't you make your own decisions? It's not that... Just wait here. I'll just come. Aunty, may I go in the fields with Rajiv? In the fields? Why ask me, you shameless girl! Ask your mother! Did you hear? Your Rajiv... ...wants to take Ganga in the fields, behind the wind-mill! Who wants to take her there? He came as a guest, mother... ...and he wants to take the girl behind bushes right in front of us! Sister! Will you shut up? Okay, I'll shut up! Let her go behind the wind-mill. It's very hot, isn't it?!! Speak softly. Why? I can't speak softly. Are we thieves? Girls do not roll in the hay before marriage! If you think it's proper, send her. Sending her to America! What are you doing there? Come... Congratulations! My dear brother, if you wanted to meet Ganga,... ...why talk of the fields? What's wrong with the fields? Look. In lndian etiquette, before marriage,... ...there are various rules and norms. A river, is no river without water. Wind is no wind without sound to it. That marriage is no marriage without a love-story. You do understand what I mean by that. No. Look, before Rajiv and Ganga get married... ...it's vital that they click! And they'll click... ...only when they chat. And they will chat, only when they meet. Why should we mind if they meet? You don't mind... ...but yesterday, that scene which Aunty made about the fields... I'm being frank. Rajiv is born in America. He'll just run away! No, no. If you wish, tomorrow, we can take them out... ...on a sight seeing tour and show them the fort there. Why should I mind? My lips are sealed! Hear that? No, son. It'll be as you say. Shut up! Will you, my dear? It will be as Arjun says. Don't go too far from the hearts that are broken. But don't go too near the ones that are beating together, either. The one who drives a Mercedes is peddling a cycle... See how in various ways he's wooing you! Too good! But I'm no less either. You saw my artistry, didn't you? How I convinced the elders, that we'll go on a picnic. This will give you a chance to talk to Rajiv. He loves you a lot. Sometimes I think... ...if he loves you so much now, how much he'll love you later! Mad! What is it, Ganga? Why are you staring at me? May I ask you something? Sure, go ahead. I know that I haven't driven Rajiv mad, but your efforts have. You are his friend, and brother too. But some kind of bond is forged between you and I also. A bond of implicit trust and friendship. Right? What do you want to say? I want to ask you,... Is Rajiv right for me? After so many days now, this kind of a question... He has hidden something from me. Yesterday I was tidying his clothes. And I found this. It's not that he smokes... ...but the fact that he hid it. If he has any more such vices... ...please tell me now. So that I can decide properly. Look, your advice can either make my life... ...or, ruin it. Ganga, you're totally mistaken. This packet is not Rajiv's. It's mine. Actually, sometimes, I do smoke. But Rajiv... never drinks and took cigarettes... There must be a lighter with this. I'd rather you not smoke either! A man looks so rotten. Shall I leave it? Leave it. There! Satisfied? You're very bad! Am I still? No. You're nice. Very nice. Two hearts are uniting... yet so quietly Two hearts are uniting... yet so quietly Everyone is getting to know. Yet, so quietly Two hearts are uniting... yet so quietly There's a longing in their breath And dreams light up their eyes You don't like anything... when you fall in love I'd get a grip on my heart... for this is magic at work Love is showing its effect... yet so quietly They sit so innocently... as if nothing were happening It's all so obvious... and clear as the day What is it, if there's nothing amiss Their lips are silent Their eyes speak... yet so silently Two hearts are uniting... yet so silently Everyone is getting to know. Yet, so quietly Two hearts are uniting... yet so silently These are the smokes that emanate before the fires rage On both sides are passions rising There's a strange attraction provoking the heart Stoking the fires in both Look at it from here... but silently Two hearts are uniting...yet so silently Everyone is getting to know. Yet, so quietly Two hearts are uniting...yet so silently Yes, Daddy. Rajiv has liked Ganga. You're not saying anything, son. Daddy, I think Ganga should go to the U.S. before marriage. See the culture, the people there. Right! It's the girl who will live abroad not the boy. It'll be nice... ...if she comes with us to America for 1-2 months and sees everything. I'm happy to see you speak so maturely. I'll talk to her father. What are you saying? That we send her to America all alone? Are you alright? What's wrong in that? He's a friend. Can't she go to my friend's house? Indian girls do not go without marrying, son. I too have decided that she will not go. Correct. Okay. Call the whole thing off. I'll speak to Kishorilal. Then what was the need for all this? Why did you call him all the way? Then what do we do? Become Americans? Come, Kishorilal. How can we send the girl without a betrothal or a confirmed relation? Just think. We live in a small town. What will people say? They've already started gossiping. And suppose she returns without marrying your son? l've got a solution to it. What? We'll get Rajiv and Ganga engaged this week itself. Then she'll go with us, and after a month... ...we'll get them married in U.S.A. in style. Okay? Okay? You shouldn't have any objection now. Why should we have any objection to an engagement? Right, my dear? Say you agree. It's okay. What I say is... ...you all come with us. No, that's impossible. It's our harvest season, you see. None of us can make it. If none of us can make it my daughter can go instead. America? No, I can't. How can you suggest it? Yes, that'll be perfect. If you stay with Ganga... ...she won't feel lonely. Go, Mom. Okay. If you all insist, I'll go. So it's all fixed now. Engagement on Monday. Then Ganga's farewell and on that note give us sweet-meats. Yes, it'll be a farewell, no doubt. Who knows when she will visit lndia? What's this? You're sitting all alone here? What's up? You're getting engaged and you're crying? I know. You don't wish to leave Papa, do you? I don't want to go anywhere! That is unavoidable, dear. All girls marry and go away one day. Leaving their mother and father behind. Forever and ever. Why are you crying now? You made me cry. You did. You made me cry. You did! Come on. The engagement and the farewell are both on Monday. The cards will be sent today. Cards? Must be Arjun's idea. What! Kusum engaged to Rajiv? Never! Did you hear that? This is absolutely unfair. The whole town knows... ...that Ganga was to marry my son. lndeed. He hasn't just insulted me, but this whole town! That's a lie! Uncle had not promised you anything. Shut up! Stop jumping, son. Will you? That foreigner is marrying Ganga. Rajiv is no foreigner. He's the son of an lndian. He is Kishorilal's son That bastard Kishorilal... First they broke the engagement, now they're breaking my son! Help! No Rajiv, No. No, Arjun. You will not fight. For my sake. We'll have to decide Surajdev. What do you mean? I'm her father. I'll give her away where I want to. How will you decide? Tell us. We'll decide today, right now. Then come let's have a combat. The winner will take Ganga. Agreed. Today, either you take her, or I will. Good! Even Lord Rama had to lift Lord Shiva's bow, to win Sita. So today whoever wins, shall be Ganga's groom! This is too much! My daughter's future will be decided by bouts? Then admit you're a cheat, and that you sold yourself to a N.R.I. Suraj is not a cheat, but you are! And we'll give you an apt reply to it. Good thing the Headman mentioned about Ram-Sita. My son's shoulder is willing to carry any bow you wish. Tell me, which bow do you have? Let me see how strong your son is! I'm ready, Daddy. So Manuchand, what's your choice? Running, wrestling, boxing...tell us!! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Done! Okay. Today and now! What? A kabaddi-match? Yes. And the winner will be sis's bridegroom! Nonsense. Go and see. Stop them. No... It won't be possible. Don't you worry, Suraj. We'll defeat them. You'll say, take care of Ganga, and I'll say she's my daughter now. So you have no right. Right on. Arjun hasn't come as yet. He's not coming with us. Why? He'll stay back a bit more. Meaning? Meaning... Here he comes. Ask him yourself. For Rajiv and you. What's this? You're not coming? I've to go back to Mathura, where my father has an old house. I've to rebuild it as a music-school. So I'll have a lot of paper work. You didn't tell me this earlier. Didn't get a chance to. Keep these. What for? I'm going abroad for the first time. I'll be so lonely. Why? There is Daddy, Rajiv, your aunt... And many others who'll take care. But you won't be there. You had said you'd be there with me. I agreed only because... Look. My responsibility, and work ends here. Now your life and my life go different ways. Okay? Why are you saying that? Because, now you've to become a responsible daughter-in-law. Abroad, and live happily with everybody. Don't give a sermon. Hurry. Your plane will leave without you. I can go alone. I don't need your help. I can take care of myself. Crazy kid! Are you Arjun Sagar? Yes. A passenger's sent you this note. Arjun, come soon. And see that girl there? In a maroon dress. That's Nita, my younger brother Sandy's wife. Sandy? Sandip actually, but he became ' Sandy' after coming here. This is Kathy... Daddy has brought a lovely girl. But she looks dominating. Why? Feeling scared? I'm not scared of anyone. Sister, does everyone wear such clothes in this country? Sister! You called me sister? Do I look like a sister to you. My name is Padma, and people out here call me Paddy. And this is your Aunty Nita. I had pointed out her to you. And he is my youngest brother, Sandy. May I go? Yes. Get lost! You rascal. Don't you have any mother and sister that you kiss her publicly like this? Is this a way to meet a girl? And you shameless girl... ...how can you be so intimate with these whites? Forgot family norms? She's still young... Why are you firing her? She's ours now. Come, my dear. - That was quite a scene. - What can I say, Mr. Mitra. Kishorilal went to lndia and got real shit for us! Ganga, my dear. Come and sit near me. Isn't she beautiful? You haven't eaten anything since morning, and you must be famished! Get some food for us, please. Today I'll eat with her. Bless you. What were you looking at? A new country? It's either very quiet here, or it's most vociferous. and is either alone, or he's in a crowd. Last night the party that was given in your honour... The abhorrence that Nita showed you... I saw and heard, too. But my Aunt was at fault too. My dear. In the house of a benevolent man like Kishorilal... ...half are lndian, and half are westerners. That's why, a pure soul like you will always be shown resentment. And you'll have to endure it. That will be your acid test. Other says a woman is tested through out her life! You've caught on. my blessings are with you. What are you whispering with my daughter, Sis? Look, she is managing the household duties already. No! She'll do nothing of the sort. She has to tour America and Canada as yet. Right, my dear? Good news, my dear. Tomorrow, in honour of our new Ambassador... ...all the lndian VlPs of the city are being invited. They'll honour you and Rajiv, too. Hasn't Arjun come as yet? He's a fool. I don't know. Should come in a couple of days. What kind of clothes should I wear tomorrow? Indian! After this, we've to welcome one more person. This welcome is of that Ganga who has come here for the 1st time. The would-be daughter-in-law of Kishorilal, Miss Kusum Ganga... ...is lndia's Goddess of knowledge, a symbol of our culture. I'll now request her to come here... ...and sing some songs for us. Your would-be daughter-in-law is very beautiful. What shall I sing? We'd all like to know... ...how you feel after coming abroad. The land where my beloved dwells... is where my heart is Oh how difficult it is... to like things To come abroad - But I don't know the full song. - Sing anyway. Arjun! You're here? Why did you take so long to come? I had such a difficult time. - Aunty had one of her scenes... - What are you doing? This is no time to chat. Everyone's looking. Go on. They want me to sing lndia song. - So sing. - You also sing with me. No, I can't sing with you. Daddy's getting angry. Go now. He's my second son. A nephew who's like a son. - No, I can't. Daddy's angry. Go! - Okay, but I've lots to tell you. The world is a bride... This is the dot that adorns her forehead That's my lndia I love my India India, my deeds are for... India, my religion The world is a bride... This is the dot that adorns her forehead India, my nation... India, I love India, my deeds are for... India, my religion This is the city's biggest paper. You too are the greatest prince. Keep it safely. We'll have it framed later. Are we going to Hollywood? Tomorrow. Who all are going? We all. Neeta Aunty too? Neeta Aunty's not going. And Arjun? He's not coming either. Yesterday I spoke to him, and, he said he can't make it. Why not? Ask him yourself. You know him well too. Now hurry up and give me a kiss. I've to go to the office. What delicious parathas! Honestly, you won't find such parathas even in lndia. Doesn't Arjun live in this house? This is the main house, not a servant quarter. You mean Arjun is a servant here? More or less. My brother-in-law... ...did quite a lot for him. He tends to our cars in our garage... ...and runs a studio above it. Here... Then where does he eat? In a hotel or some such place. When he comes here, we feed him, like we feed the poor. To hell with Arjun. Have this, else it'll get cold. Krishna has sent these especially for you. Will you do me a favour? Yes. Kusum Ganga has sent you this letter... ...and the parathas for us! Let me eat them... ...and you read the letter. It says... Little Master Arjunji... Don't show your mastery... Come with us quietly. Daddy's orders totally, and... ...swear on me honestly. If someone wrote such things to me... Honestly... ...I'd go to hell with her! ldiots! She's going to be Rajiv's wife. Going-to-be... she isn't yet! See this! What did you do with that paper? Lost it! Where? I don't remember where I put it... I wrapped parathas in it. Parathas? For Arjun. Really? Meaning... ...you wrapped up my respect along with those parathas too! I must say that you are typical Indian idiot It's so obvious! You said it this once... Don't ever repeat it! Why don't you understand, that it was the only copy I had! But it's original copy is with me! You didn't tell Rajiv, that when you sent me those parathas... ...you had sent me a letter, that I take this photograph... ...and frame it beautifully. You do forget. Look. See how I've put it in a beautiful frame. See what Rajiv's doing? He's smoking a cigarette. And you said he never smoked. This is America. We're in a disco. It's fashionable to smoke here. 90% people here are smoking. So Rajiv is from those 90%. You lied to me, didn't you? What am I asking you? Who was she? He's saying that the boy and the girl who win this contest... ...will have to give a number and if that matches their number... ...then they'll get the Made in Heaven Award. Made in Heaven Award? Why's that? According to them, the couple made in this world... ...is not as great as the pair made in Heaven! Good! Shall we go to Rajiv? Want to play? Come on... Let's take part in the contest. It's a kid's game, dear. What will I do in it? Make Arjun your partner. No. I won't go with Arjun. Why not? She won't go. And she shouldn't I'll dance with Kelly... I'm willing to go with you. I can buy everything! Everything... This is a normal scene. He drinks and gets knocked out. And Arjun takes him home. How are you, dear? Fine. How's Rajiv? Nice. And Arjun? Very nice! Are you happy abroad? I don't know. There's everything... yet nothing. I've invited 1,000 guests... Book all the 5-star hotels. The whites will never forget my son's marriage. What are all these papers... Don't you clean your master's room? He doesn't allow anyone in. What dirty magazines... What are you looking at? What... what's all this? Oh that! She's Rajiv's girlfriend, Kelly. Kelly loved Rajiv, and he too loved her very much. But he never mentioned this. Is this something one mentions? Dear girl... Girlfriends are a status symbol of the richie-rich! Consider yourself lucky, that Kelly didn't get Rajiv, but you did. The USD550million millionaire Kishorilal's daughter-in-law... ...will be you, not Kelly. My doll, this is America... Rajiv is an American, and you... ...you'll have to stay with an American. Kelly was your girlfriend, right? Did you love her very much? Even wanted to marry her? Did you and Kelly... I mean... ...did you have a physical relationship with her. In America such relationships occur... they just happen. Why make such a national issue out of it? Kelly was my past, and, you are my present. You won't believe it, but we were just talking about you. Honest. Going to Australia, eh? Tonight? Want to meet me, eh? Then come to my office... ...we'll go together for a dinner. Kelly learnt Hindi when we were going around together. It's essential that I go, else Kelly will be offended. I'll be coming in late, so you better have your dinner. I brought this... I entered at the wrong time. Nevermind, later may be. Wait! Everything's gone haywire. And it's all your fault! You lied through your teeth! Rajiv's like this and that... This is Rajiv's true picture. Look, all these small petty matters... ...you'll have to adjust yourself to them. Small petty matters? Is this a small matter? This is a small petty matter in your view? Look, I don't want jilted palaces! I just want some love from a man. Understand? Small matter, indeed! But everybody here loves you. No! And I don't want such love. I don't! What kind of love do you want? Ask yourself that! The kind of love you give others. That's the kind of love I want! Taking me to be some innocent photo, you've trapped me in a golden frame. And you want me to hang on some wall quietly... ...and become a part of this synthetic decor! Had I come with this dream to this foreign land, Arjun? Look, everything will be fine. I'll talk to Rajiv myself tomorrow. But Ganga... ...you too will have to take things patiently. I'll go now. You'll also not leave me, will you? She's not that kind of a girl. Then what kind of a girl is she? Look, don't get me wrong. But girls from lndia... ...especially those from rural areas, they can't bear this cultural shock. If you want to change her, then go slow about it. After marriage... Look. You're my friend. And Ganga's my wife. Let the friend stay a friend, And the wife, a wife. And it'll be better if you don't interfere in our personal matters. Your role as a friend ends here. Now let me play my role. Whether you accept it or not. You've fallen in love. No! Yes! No! Yes! No? Yes! Well, you are, aren't you? I won't go to her house, nor will I meet her. Okay? Okay. Let's see. What! He'll never come here? Even to meet me? Okay. Go tell him this. If he's not bothered about me, I don't care either! Cares, my foot! If he really cared, he'd answer my calls. Today's his birthday? He doesn't want to meet anyone? Not even me? I'll show him! Arjun is not in. Don't know when he'll return. If any one calls, tell them I'm out. I wish to be alone today. So what if it's his birthday? He didn't invite me. He hasn't invited anyone. He's all alone and depressed. So what shall I do about it? Look, in America we leave people alone, if they wish it. But in lndia we never leave our friends alone. In fact, we gate-crash and wish our friends on such occasions. This isn't lndia, but America! But he's still your friend. Have you forgotten his obligations? He didn't oblige me, but Daddy. He wants Daddy to take interest in a music company he wishes to launch. Anyway, I've to attend a party, and... Look Ganga... ...you can go with Paul if you wish. And... take some old gift lying around the house for him. Have you understood now, what Rajiv wants? Some day I will meet you Some day I will meet you My love will be with me that day But who knows when will this shower of love take place My heart is thirsty and my heart is lonely Just step out from the picture (in my mind) and come before me My Love.... You're my fate; fight out (of the picture) and come before me My love.. Just step out from the picture (in my mind) and come before me My love.. I don't even remember since when, perhaps as long as I've existed I have loved you ever since I'm your poet, and you are my poem. Lately, I'm restless.. longing for you.... Just tell me who she is At least show me this picture of her It is true that these stories shouldn't be shared with just anyone But you can't hide it from friends I'll take care of the pain in your heart If I can't do anything, then I'll pray for you If I can't do anything, then I'll pray for you She'll struggle out (of the picture) and come; you'll unite with her, Your love, your beloved Some day I will meet you My love will be with me that day But who knows when will this shower of love take place My heart is thirsty and my heart is lonely Just step out from the picture (in my mind) and come before me My Love... Yes... It's 11:30 p.m. Everyone's waiting for you. It's Arjun's birthday today. Everyone's ridiculing you that you're dancing with those workers. But I've taken Rajiv's permission. I'm asking you for the last time. Are you coming home this minute, or not. Aunty... No! Just a minute. Talk to Arjun. I couldn't make it, friend. Now send my Ganga back. She and Paul are just leaving. And listen. Tomorrow... ...I'm holding a party at the dockyard... ...and you're attending it. I won't be able to, Rajiv. Oh come on. The problem is one of the musicians has run off. So in his place, you come with your guitar... No Arjun! Why did you hit him? He went for her chunni... So? It's embarrassing for her. Isn't it my job to protect her? Whose wife is she going to be? mine or yours? It's my job to protect her, not yours! You small fries shouldn't be invited at all. Aunty was right. Just Get Lost! But... You shut up!! Go! Go! Get Lost! Leave us alone A storm never warns before it hits. It just comes, ruins everybody, and goes away. What are you hinting at? Fire and wax... ...have a star-crossed relationship. We just know... ...that they emit light together. But we don't realise this... ...that under that fire, the wax is slowly melting away. Come straight to the point. The intimacy between Arjun and Ganga is... Enough! You had your say today, but don't give it a thought hereafter. Whatever's to be done, leave it to me. Did you call me, Daddy? Yes, Arjun. I've some good news for you. Good news? You've been chosen as the President of our auto company in Los Angeles You'll also have its major share holdings. Now you'll have your own bungalow, a car... You like my car very much, right? Here, take these. From today the car is yours. You seem very happy today. What's the matter? I'm happy, and I'm sad too. Sad because you'll have to leave this city tomorrow itself. Rajiv will get married on the 9th. Be present here on the 9th morning. That means I'll have to leave tomorrow morning? Yes. Tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.! Tomorrow morning... Can't I leave after 2 days? No. It concerns your career, and you have your first Board meeting. You'll have to go. Bless you. Now you too select a nice girl and settle down. I'll go now, Dad. God bless you.. Call Arjun on the line. I'm Ganga speaking. Arjun has gone. Where to? That I don't know. But I do know that he has left us! This morning, when we were all sleeping, he just left. Yes, Papa. This is Kusum Ganga. You phoned after ages. How's mother? And the boys? And Duksha-Sonali? I'm fine. He has gone out. Everybody's gone out. I'm alone here. I'm alright. And happy too. No... I'm very happy. Why do you ask again and again? Yes? my voice? It's because of the ice-cream. Aren't you coming to U.S.A.? Please come, Papa... I can't hear... Can't hear... No, my dear. Don't cry so. You had an engagement ring... Where is it? Engagement ring? Where is it? Where did I keep it? I'll tell you. Since yesterday evening... ...it was lying by the pool. And now... ...it's in my hand. Hence, put it on. Take this. Put it on. I've brought you from lndia. You are hope to your parents. And, future to us. You are Rajiv's life in the years ahead. I know my son is a difficult person. But by getting to know his American ways and habits... ...change them to your liking. Promise! Isn't that what we had promised each other? Hadn't we? I've to go to Los Vegas with my friends for a wedding. Then go! Take her with you too. And show her the town. Of Course! Of course, my foot! First apologise to her. Say sorry. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.. See? How soft hearted my son is! Now go do your packing, and get into a happy mood... ...and go to Los Vegas. Kishorilalji... What's this Los Vegas like? It's a town full of good-time, and vices, from song-dance... ...gambling, marriages, honey-moon. All sorts of fun and frolic. Are they meant only for kids? No. Adults also go there. But not with children! When will we go there? I meant you, me, Krishna-amma, and other family members? I'll also be taking you all. Really? To the temple! You mean Arjun left the city? Before a fire breaks out, there's always smoke... This air there is like the scene here. Heart, this heart Heart, this heart Heart, this heart This heart is crazy Crazy heart has also made me crazy I even left her city I broke the heart in her street Yet this heart beats in this body I even removed her from my heart I did what I shouldn't have But even so, her memory still drives this heart This heart is crazy... What is the mistake of heart? What complaint do I have against it? What has my heart even done other than to fall in love Heart is a lover not some thief, what am I to do I have no control over my heart, what am I to do Heart is a lover not some thief, what am I to do I have no control over my heart, what am I to do This heart is crazy... How ungrateful this heart is It is a picture I tell him to break it;he replies it is a chain(which is holding me) It is not a weak thread, what am I to do I have no control over my heart, what am I to do It is not a weak thread, what am I to do I have no control over my heart, what am I to do Heart, this heart This heart is crazy Crazy heart has also made me crazy This heart is crazy..this heart This heart is crazy... What are you doing? I'm playing with this romantic city of lights. I'm teaching you how to make love. I don't want to learn. Now go to your room please Look, you'll have to learn that. Every wife has to, else the husband gets offended. Look, I'm not your wife. There are still a few days left for our wedding. So what? We'll get married right now. There! We're married. I beg you. Please go to your room. All my western friends, with their girl friends,... ...are enjoying life behind closed doors. Try to understand. They are westerners. And we're lndians. Our culture forbids boys and girls doing such things before marriage. We're also going to get married soon. Then wait for a few days. Let's take our vows atleast. Let me become your wife... Vows, Vows! It's all bullshit, it's all nonsense! I mean...let's not waste time okay! Come here.. Leave me... Don't touch me! There is nobody as hypocritical and you lndians, Mention sex, and you start whining and crying! The two sexes are kept separate; women have their own society. Men have their own. Yet you have a world record in population! You're the hypocrite! You bloody Indians! You, your parents, and other family members... are all illiterate villagers... double standard, stupid people! Want to hear more? Your lndia too, is no better than shit! It stinks like cow-dung! You fiend! You abuse our lndia! Well, listen! From today, I'm breaking off this relation with you. I discard this ring, a fraud symbol of our bond... We consider you, your wealth and your drug-infested America... ...unworthy of holding a candle to lndia. Now go away from here. Get out at once!! You struck me! Rajiv...don't touch me. How did she disappear, damn it! I told you, I don't know. She wasn't there in the morning, I don't know where she went. I can't believe it! Phone the police commissioner, and take an urgent appointment for me. Come with me, Sandy. You better find our girl. Else her father will raise hell here! This truck driver says, he left some lndian girl... ...at the Waterfront Rly. Station. Ganga! What happened? Don't cry, please. Listen to me. What happened? Tell me... Why did you do this? You ran away all alone? Tell me, what's the matter? Stop crying and tell me what happened? Who did this to you? Rajiv. Okay. Let's go. Don't cry. We'll go home. No! I don't want to! Listen... No! Didn't you hear me? I don't want to marry, nor stay in America. I don't want to stay here, Okay, we won't stay here. But we'll meet Daddy atleast. No! Go ahead, if you wish. I'll die, but I won't go back! I've taken a vow! Shut up! Stop this madness, and let's go. No Arjun. You'll send me to lndia. Now! This moment! Okay, I'll take you back. This is a foreign place. Meet Dad, just once Don't take me back if you wish. I'll go alone. I don't need you! I can do without you. No! I'll go on my own. I told you this was foreign land. Let's go from here. No! You are lying! It's true. My friend saw them boarding a plane for Delhi. This cannot be! Be bold enough to face the truth. No! No! Give me a call to America. The number is... You will not phone them. You will never phone them. We are dead to them, and they are dead to us! That is it Sis! Wake up! I'm Dabboo. Wake up. I've been betrayed! I'll not keep quiet. We'll leave for lndia tonight! India?? To fight?? Yes - No, its not right Why?? - Because we are not bad people We are good Indians! But I'm bad Paul Ganga will have to return! She's mine and will always be mine! You wolf in sheep's clothing! Now I know what your game is! What's my game? You lured her into your arms... ...and betrayed my friend and you lied about Rajiv. No! What are you doing! Slashing the very person who... Get aside! Why didn't you die there? I had seen you off in bridal finery. I wish you had returned in a shroud! A least you wouldn't have returned with shame with this rascal! What do you think you're doing? You'll not hit Ganga! I'll kill her! My blood will flow before hers. And it too will say, Ganga is as pure us the Ganges. Get out! I'll go. Now. This very moment. Never to return. But you'll not lift your hand to hit her. You go now!! I said get out!! For God's sake, please go. Else, it'll be disastrous. - No!, No!, Arjun is innocent - Shut up! I don't believe a word you say. You have let me down! Betrayed us very badly. Our self-respect has gone to dogs! Die! Die, damn you! Papa, No!! I'll really and truly die! Stop him, Papa. Rs. 50 only, It fulfills all your wishes. When is the Mathura bus due? It's gone. How long ago? One hour. When is the next one? Evening. A what time? 6.30 p.m. Where are you from? Nowhere! Look all of you, try to understand me. There's nothing between Arjun and me. These are all lies! Then change those lies into truth, Sis. Yes, Sis. We all agree on this. Only Arjun loves you truly. Not Rajiv. Remember? Once you had said... Sing the song which is fragrant with this soil. Arjun has that. You realised that later, but we all knew it from the beginning. What are you all advising her on the sly? Get lost from here. Granny, we just... Go away! Else your Dad will kill you. Eat a few morsels, my dear. You've not eaten for hours. No, Granny. I won't eat anything. Your father and mother... ...have shut you in because their own eyes are shut! But this old woman's eyes, are still wide open at this age! I agree with what Daksha and Sonali have said. Granny! My dear, Arjun is a God-sent boon. And such blessings are not to be let go, so easily. Go, stop him. I'm practicing what I'm preaching. Everything has been done to help you escape from here. Look. There are your helpers. To help you escape from this jail. They're all ready. Where's Ramu? Mother. Rajiv is in lndia. I see. Where's Suraj? He has gone to collect Kulwanti and Kishorilal. What! Is that man coming here too? What will we tell them? Love is worship And worship is love This is madness; so is that This is love; so is that What's gotten into me? Everyone is worried I've fallen in love It wasn't supposed to happen It wasn't supposed to happen.. but it happened I have fallen in love It wasn't supposed to happen.. It wasn't supposed to happen.. but it happened I have fallen in love The world doesn't know the hearts This heart doesn't listen to the world There isn't anything else, only love is that Which recognizes the glances of lovers Stop right there. And go back home. I will. But tell me just once... ...that you don't love me. No. I don't love you. But you do! This is not proper. Then say that. Why do you say you don't love me? No! I don't love you at all. Understand? Now go back home. Go! Now the time of decisions has come close What choice do I make, my heart has said this my heart has said this, my heart has said this if you have the desire to live then get ready to die I have fallen in love, I have fallen in love It wasn't to happen, it wasn't to happen, but it happened I have fallen in love, I have fallen in love I have sent my wedding dress back to my father I have now donned love, i have wrapped love around my head I have thrown away the ring of false traditions in an alley I have broken all the chains of modesty, i have escaped all confinement On every step even if i stumble, I will keep on walking with my eyes downcast In front of me is my lovers home, the world got left behind Come i will make a prayer, may i get back my separated friend My old spiritual guide, may i get my love I have colored my red scarf with my hearts blood I have colored my red scarf with my hearts blood May this younion occur, let the ocean meet the ganges river Let the ocean meet the ganges No Why did you bring him here? Why?? It wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen It wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen, but it happened I have fallen in love, i have fallen in love I have fallen in love It wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen It wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen, but it happened I have fallen in love, I have fallen in love I have fallen in love it wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen It wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen, but it happened I have fallen in love.... my beloved, my beloved my beloved, my beloved, my beloved... The bullet which will leave the pistol I have in my pocket... ...will either target you, or me. I trusted you. ...gave you everything. Tell me the truth now. What is the truth? Tell me. Truth? You don't want to know the truth. Because those who want to know it, don't carry a pistol... ...in their pocket, and, hatred in their hearts. It takes a big heart. One needs a big heart... ...to hear the truth. And the truth is... When a man gains status with wealth and power... ...he distances himself from truth and moral. He thinks, whatever he thinks is the truth. Whatever he did, was right. And that's what has happened with you too, sir. You made it big alright, but remained small in personal matters. Because the truth is, that you lied to yourself. You lied that an lndian girl can be a wife to a foreigner like him. And to turn this lie into truth, you made me lie too. And l, suppressed under your obligations, lied through my teeth. Lied that Rajiv is very nice. A very nice boy without any vices whatsoever. He's a son of a great, millionaire lndian. A son of a wealthy man. A son... yes! A son, sir. But not an lndian. And the truth is, I always lied to Ganga. What is your relationship with Ganga? Trust. Respect, reverence, and... Love. If protecting her, adds up to love, then, yes! Yes! Yes! I love her. And I always will. But I never tried to woo her for myself. And neither will I do it now. Because Ganga is yours. Her father's. Mother's. I'll go now, sir. And I'll never come back. You heard the truth from Arjun. Now hear me also. Want to see, Daddy, what your son wanted to do... ...in a drunken state, at the Las Vegas hotel... ...behind bolted doors with me? Then see this. See the scars and wounds due to his lust. I ask you, what kind of a culture is this... ...where a would-be husband, behaves like this with his fiancee? Even then, if you ask me to throw myself in this fire... ...then I'll do it, Papa. Because you are my father. Decider of my fate. If you ask me to take poison... ...I'll take it! Why should you? For centuries now, we women have been taking poison only. First we listen to our parents, then the husband, and finally, kids! You'll not take any poison! Don't interfere, mother. Keep quiet! You've lost your senses! You've humiliated this poor girl. Didn't you sing, lndia is my country and religion? You wished to nestle an lndian girl, lndia itself,... in America? Is this what you achieved? Wonderful! I ask you, if a girl from here goes to another land... ...where she has nothing in common, why should she go there? Ganga will go abroad! You're still saying that? Yes! I'm still saying it. Remember me saying, One day, I'd make her my son's wife? From this house, to that one? By asking you for her hand... With folded hands? She'll become my daughter-in-law. Alright. But as the wife of... ...not Rajiv, but Arjun. Yes, she'll marry Arjun! Your mother is right. If a girl from here... goes to another land... What are you doing, Dad? I'm your son, dad! Get lost from here! and go back to America!! Serve you right!
