Anne! Anne! Anne! You have been out here since lunch. You never remember to tell me where you?re going. You missed our entire history class, the fall of Rome. This is one of the privileges of heaving mother a schoolteacher. What a relief to be rescued! The book is a perfect tragedy. It would be a tragedy indeed, if we miss our train. Your father is home from the logging camp, Remember. we've got to go. Might be that book gives me a trill! It's the story of the daughter of a belted earl, stolen away in infancy by a cruel nurse, who died before she can confess. There is nothing lovelier, then having mother to gather me up. Come on, Anne... Mother! Mother! Where are you? Hi! Hi! I figured you out here writing. There is a read through with the cast this afternoon, and they had some notes they want to share with you, before we get started. I am a novelist? I'm not used to Notes from all these people. Could you go and just fulfill me in? Would you tell the cast, that you going to hold off on it for now. I mean it's not a disaster, Obviously you have a different concept. It's not stage worthy Ann. Not yet, anyway. My concern is that, I don't think it?s going to be ready to be performed this summer. I can put in another play and you just keep working on that. This came for you. The boys all off celebrating. This is a huge victory. You'll hear from him. Don't worry. Will see you later. Thanks. Four exciting new plays. I know I sound like a typical mother, but you know what your brother can be like. Frankly I'm terrified, Franny. Dominic said he'd be on the first boat back from England I know, I know, I'm sorry to bother you. Is the baby better? Oh don't be silly. You come all the way to hear. Toomey has a mom. I just needed someone to talk to. Why wouldn't Dominic be in touch with me? Oh, I hear the baby crying. You better go. Give him a big kiss for me. I love you. Okay. Bye-bye. It's easy to write to cry I never expected this life for Gil Send Dominic home. Get him back to me. Maybe he is alright and just doesn't want to get in touch with me. You can't act like that with people who raised you. Though never knowing who your real parents are can always haunt you Well done! Alright everybody time to packing in before I decide to recast. Thanks for coming out. Goodnight, Anne. Sorry about all this changes in the play. 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Learn your lines. Any word on Dominic yet? Come on, Ann. He will be back. Dominic is a big boy. So you are going to start rewriting and making me a big-time producer, or what? Oh, the Great American impresario was far away from the Broadway, you can get? You know, I don't get it. What are you doing here? Call me and say you have a great idea for a play, that want to challenge yourself. What did you come here for? What did you come here for? I came here to sell Green Gables. Doing a play with you was just an excuse to get here. Don't waste my time. Just go away. Just leave me alone. I always needed to write. I've made up stories about myself all my life. Used to pretend my parents where a perfect couple living in harmony. I did it so often and for so along, it's hard to know where the truth is anymore. I would not recognize my father if I saw him. Bertha I promised you I was going to quit the logging camp. You can build your own home instead of living in a boardinghouse. Walter Shirley! you are an intoxicated braggart You're going to kill both of us with this crazy nag! This horse can do the mail run from Grand Falls to St. John in 12 hours. This is pretty penny to be made if I can get the contract. Your mother was my best friend. She'd like you to have this. She would want me to look after you. Since Dr. and Mrs. Thomas where so close to Bertha, Walter Shirly and I have asked Dr. Thomas to give a few words of eulogy toward this dear woman. Walter Shirly was not at fault. He loved his wife. Our school teacher and friend Bertha, has been stolen from our community in an accident of Biblical proportions. But the white majesty of death now falls upon this beloved woman and sets her apart to be crowned and to live forever in God's heavenly kingdom. I'm sorry for a your loss. Be strong child. Thank you. If Mom has been crowned a Queen then what am I? a child of God sweetheart. Would'nt it be better to tell people from now on that I was the daughter of a Queen, than to endure the notoriety of such a tragedy. It's better to speak the truth. Your mother may have had a noble dreams. but She died of no money or dignity. Was her sore. Now thanks to your father. I hope my husband can find him and bring back. Don't be so hard at yourself, Walt. The Almighty thinks it is better to be twelve of us. Right? Hey, what's that saying. "To err is human and to forgive is divine." No, Doc. I killed her. Hey, stop it, stop it. Walter. Drunken fools!. Somebody help me. Walt! I am coming. No, you're not listening, Louisa. He went back to the river. He wanted to drown this sorrows, literally. And you pushed him. I rescued him. You know what, I'll say, it was a noble performance for the entire town to see. But he's taken off. We may never see the likes of Walter again. Do you have any idea how mortifying it is to be at funeral of a dear friend while the town's esteemed doctor. is off on a bender The whole town knows what the disgusting pair of you've been up to. This is only a drop. Walter desperately needed my support to absolve himself in front of town. It's all it was. Temperance will be preached in this house. Walter needs a good kick in the pants and so do you. Louisa. You can have water Don't? No, no. Step outside now. Hey, come on now, stop it! You're mom's making a mess here. You're making a mess here. Do not wake up the children. Katie, I'm convinced that it must have been a disappointment to my father if he is not coming back. Mother said, that he was a free spirit. I made up my mind I could be a free spirit myself. I'm resolved that the Thomases will be my new family. yet my life does not have to be graveyard of buried hopes. The only thing I recall about my father, Was how my mother was drawn to him. Like a moth to a flame. Gene. I don't want you to feel any pressure about producing my play. Good. I'm feeling pressure to make money this summer. What would you say about me going to Green Gables to write. It's a great idea. That's doing both us a word of good. Come on, Elsie! I promised Anne, we will be ready by 10. You know what a pistol she is. You can't clear out 30 years of living in old place like this in a couple of days. Look how young mom and dad looked when we first moved here. I'm furious at them for letting this place get so ran down, when Anne was so generous for letting us live here for years. When we had nowhere else. Oh, do not preach them. They took them place in Albafras Why Ann's own kids have not taken any interest? just playing weird. Too far to come. Ann is just easier for our family to fix everything. Elsie, John? it's Anne... Aunt Ann come up. What mischief are you up to Marilla's room. Terrific to see you. Oh, your mother finally written aren't she? I just was wondering if she lost every letter I have written her in those two months. Oh, I know she's been awful at responding to everybody. She's taken up golf. We were just finishing packing or, so we thought. And we have found all these letters in the closet, in the floor. These are Marilla's love letters between Marilla and John Blight. They quarreled, you know, and she was really sorry she didn't forgive him when she had a chance. What a great well-kept secret. Who is Walter Sirley? How did Marilla know your family if your parents died when you were born? My dearest? Shall I to? my dearest daughter, please, accept this note, as a confirmation, that I have come to a much better circumstances in my life and so I feel it is my duty to try to locate you. I have finally had the good luck to marry that wonderful woman. I have prosperous hardware business in Fredericton now. It is my sincere hope that you can forgive me for the expanse of time that has lapsed between us, and come back to me. I realize you are likely in a much better circumstances, than we can ever provide. And so I'm trusted in our mutual acquaintance Ms. Nelly Parkhurst to make contact with you again and to determine if my approach is acceptable to you and your guardians. For so many years your mother wanted me to quit the logging camp and build a home for us. Maybe now I can fulfill my promise. If you cannot forgive me for the harm that has come to you, as a result of my neglect, I will respect your wishes. Any response will be welcomed. Your loving father Walter. Marilla must have felt she needed to protect me, or she was frightened, that I'd leave. Protect you from what? Ah, with Marilla that would have been an instinct. So you were not an orphan. As a child I made up stories about my parents. No one knew within about me so it was? it was easy. I have given up hope of ever finding my father. Let me help. What luck is finding Marilla's letters. What a luck. Do you mind if we tell mom? She always said, with your imagination, you are destined to be a great writer. Yeah I'd longed to write once, but now I just do it to work out everything else. You never can tell, why certain people do decide to write. Obviously it's very personal. Yes, well,certain people like me are born to travel, while others, like your mother, blessed with a desire to play golf. Thank you, Anne, for my entire family. Mother said, she will call, when she knows the place is sold. She has not written before, because she didn't want to discuss it. We had so many wonderful years growing up here. Why did you ever give it to us? Well, Gil's medical practice wasn't in this aria and your parents were down on a luck ------ Don't sell it, Ann. Oh, well I have complicated feelings about this place. We will talk soon, okay. I don't know how I survived the time before I was adopted by the Cuthberts. It was horrible after my mother died. the Thomases gave up on me and I lost hope of ever seeing my father again. The cash from selling your mother's things were given to the town. I will pay you board for a time. We are leaving. Suddenly my husband has lost his license for practice medicine. Can you have me until my father comes? You need to know that your father has gone for good. I heard someone say: "he is drowned in his own sorrow". He is not really dead, is he? In some respects he is. Things haven't worked out well for either of us, Anne. No need for theatrics, Louisa, you have done your duty. God help you keep that sorry husband of your sober in the next town. Thanks God the county found the room. The child would be much b etter placed in an orphanage or a Foster house. No family will take her in, after that sorry business with her father. You have to take her. The Dr. Thomas are leaving town it's the county's responsibility We'll do what we can. We don't normally take children. A little beggar like you should thank the Lord that we're taking pity on you at all. Stop it! I need water! Some of them here need to be kept and checked all times. You will sleep here with these three. To sleep in such cramped quarters, is much more, than my imagination can be abide by. We don't harbor to royalty here Miss. I understood you might have been paid for on my behalf. You either put up or shut up. Put this uniform on at sunrise when you get up. Move, our girls! you will not need whatever in their You will get your chores assigned first thing. By the way, I heard all about Walter Sirley. Can you move over, please. I really didn't understand. I had never experienced hypocrisy before. It was incomprehensible to me. How our God could abandon me! I didn't want to give in. I decided, that God just forgotten about everyone in that place. And in my heart I was afraid something awful was going to happen. What did you bring in your suitcase? What are you doing? No, stop! Nice! That's pretty. Silence! God in his wisdom has chosen to make you poppers, not animals! But dependent upon a charity of others, none less harmony and peace must be maintained here at any cost. No, those are my only possessions. No! Come here, you. You see this young rat? Her father is a criminal, accused of doing in his own wife. Keep away from her. Beware of her manner of speech, which she uses to deceive. Only stiff punishment can save her. No one gets away with this kind of behavior here. You will remain standing until daybreak. God punishes the disobedient with eternal damnation. I've tried imagine someone finding me. Someone who would rescue me and care for me. I gathered no one is supposed to speak to you. Want some water? You have been here an eternity haven't you? I was staying in a dark trying to imagine I was a bride in a misty veil, waiting in eternity for her betrothed who has left her at the altar. This is a far worst place, than even I could ever imagine. So it was a task to pretend. I'm sorry for rambling on so. Nobody talks to me here do go on. Well, when I sow how tyrannical matron was to you on my very first Stay. I would instinctively you must be the product of lifelong sorrow. I don't dare talking about that. The walls have years. Why was she so cruel to you, then? She's afraid. I know the secret to free everyone in this place. But, you see, I am not leaving until I finish my life's vocation. And there is so much in I need help. I have the key into freedom. And why do you allow yourself to remain imprisoned. I am editing in the history of every word in English language for posterity. I'm so sorry. I don't mean to be impolite, Sir. but I am afraid, the dictionary has already been invented. Did you not know that? I have never heard such a word before. You don't have a single soul in the world, do you? I had a wife and a daughter once. They still console me... Here, as life marches on. You don't know how difficult it is to draw a line between a past and a presence. We are imprisoned here forever? Please, there is so much work to be done. Memories, notations? They all need to be copied. Only at night, when no one can see. I will help you. what's your name? Gabriel? Blake. Gabriel? Gabriel was a heavenly messenger, wasn't he? The County should be pleased with the God fearing ideals with our attendance here. Purge of pride and eager for employment, each one earns his keep. What devilment, are you up to? Where did you get this? Get in there. This child is very disobedient. Gabriel Blake has been filling her head full of foolishness. As members of the board, I am pleased to be able to demonstrate to you our exacting method of inmate discipline. Her flaming red hair is a real cause of her devilish behavior. Scissors, please, matron. No, no, no! Take it matron and burn it. You will stand again until daybreak. I'd like to speak to you outside. Don't you dare! No one acknowledge this guttersnipe! You know the routine orderlies Get me that cup! Come on, Gabriel. Your little scrap just worsening your trial here by inciting calamity. I'm devastated. It's all my fault. Never mind, there is a darkness here which needs to be rectified. Your innocence may assist me, if I have my way. I can see we have no choice, doctor? We must condemn the building and expel the overseers. But I indeed want this child to speak to our entire board at the right opportunity. Gabriel, are you awake? I heard the superintendent. She wants to help. She wants the doctor to send me away. I go fetch your books and notes. The secret? The key? under the board in the bag. It's yours. Go, now. Freedom I never... you'll need it. I will not go till they bring you back. Hold my hand. So splendid to have a friend! You are a true kindred spirit. What's that? A kindred spirit's someone you can rely on, right to the innermost part of your soul. I feel so tired. Gabriel! Angels have watched over me all my life, rescuing me. The board of the Boulinbrook County poorhouse listened to me. It was a feeling I'd never experienced before. It made me begin to feel like I had a voice. The County Board has found a special foster home for you and ---- girls. Consider it an honor that they have gone to such trouble. You leave tomorrow. No honor having you be the one to tell me so, matron. You and your husband have no spark of kindness in you. I will never forget what you did to Gabriel. You had no right. First County Poorhouse will be sent to a brand new building. You will be better there. You are so kind. We'll come back for the next group in an hour. Where is that red head kid? She is on the next load. Coming, mom, coming! Mrs. Thomas! Good Lord, Ann Shirley! What, in heavens name, are you doing here? Violetta! Mrs. Thomas! Fate has brought us together. Jock, Keith, wait! You look entirely like thieves running away in the night. That is pretty putting it mildly. I don't know what you're doing I cannot possibly take on another runaway when we are running away ourselves. You will help me? I'm begging you Mrs Thomas. I know how to be resourceful. I even thought of changing my name. So No one would ever recognize me again! I'd love to be called something elegant, like Cordelia. That's a horrible name. What about Geraldine Fitzgerald? Who Cares what's you called! You can't stay with us that's final. You and my mother were best of friends. That practically makes us kin. Didn't you hear, our mother were in too much troubles as it is. And it is all thanks to you. Stop it, Jock. There is a poetic irony that we altogether as fugitives Is that the trouble, you mean Mrs. Thomas? Yes, well, you see, Ann, things went from bad to worse after your father vanished so did all the funds from the parish roof box. And the town accused my husband. But he insisted that was your father Your father's trash, Anne. And so we've been living under house arrest in the half way hotel. Awaiting an inquest, because my husband was killed by a train. Do you think he was? I've been in the depths of despair. Being a doctor's wife has been a life of bitter disappointment, Annie. I can hardly swallow. It will be too much for mother, to be cross examined and have to go back over and over for the inquest. Our grandmother's very rich and she wants us to come and live with her. if they're anything I can do to help Leave us alone! When we get to St. John's we will go you to some place safe. Stand back. Apparently there is a family home in Fredrickson. just outside of Marysville. Yes that would be St. Agatha Asylum, ma'am. I'm sorry Annie but we have to drop you off there. Thank you for your directions. Hurry, boys. Boys, harry up the train leaves in three minutes. I've made up my mind to simply enjoy this train ride. Train rides are so thrilling! Anne, That's only a train. Now, would you take your own ticket? It's your responsibility. We need to get some flowers for grandmother. You choose a color and Mother'll have change. What lovely wild roses! looking so happy to be roses. Could I just have some change? We're going to buy flowers for grandmother. I wish roses could talk. Oh, they surely have hopeful thoughts. All passengers! Now boarding for... Here you go. Hurry up, mother says we?re late. Hurry up, Anne. I suppose mother is already on the train. I hope your grandmother likes pink. Red head people can never wear pink. Did you ever know anybody who's head was red when they were young, but changed color when they grew up? No, put your bag up. Could you help me, please, sir? We?re this way mother! All Aboard! Here we go. Thank you. You're welcome. All in the board. Mrs. Thomas! Mrs. Thomas! Mrs. Thomas! Ann what are you doing there? You're going the wrong way! Last call for passengers to Marysville and Fredrickton. All aboard! ______ Mrs. Thomas you are on the wrong train! No, Anny, you are on the wrong train. We don't have much time. Anne! Jump! Where is my purse? I left it right here. Hurry, that's our train. The only train to Fredrickson until tomorrow. Grandmother will be waiting on the other end and she'll be burst of blood vessel. I blame myself entirely Mrs. Thomas. Violetta was following me. If I hadn't lost myself in the beauty of those colorful blossoms, at so little color in my life, lately. And salt has been added to injured, and now we obliged to sleep in a common Railway Station. I'm cursing myself because I lost my purse, and all my money. My mother in law will be entirely unimpressed. Feel free to blame this entire mess on a hopeless orphan who wasn't given a brain God gave kiss, Mrs. Thomas You must call me Louisa. You know your mother was quite brilliant. She used to help me with Sunday school. She really knew how to fasten Intellect, she was a wonderful teacher, who knew so many lovely promises by heart. The Lady of the lake, Seasons by Thurston. She cultivated me and if you a half as bright as she is, then I know that you will make a wonderful teacher too one day. You have given me hope Mrs. Louisa. I'd hate to part ways on bad terms, especially since I was trying so hard to imagine you will keep me forever. I have a confession to make yet. I took some money from the selling of your mother's things. I mean, not a lot, but I wish at the time when my husband was not bear dependable, he was so cross with your father. I know, see, you and I destined to be great friends. And I won't desert you, either. I will help you all morning, if you could give us a rid. If you really want a ride you better tell me your name. My name is Cordelia Shirley. We walked all along from Bolingbroke, and missed our train. Don't know Walter Shirley from Bolingbroke area? Accused of doing his wife in as I recall. No, ma'am. I've never heard of such a man. Under contract for the mailroute up to Grand Falls. My father's name was Jedediah. I know it's rather an awful name, don't you think? Hard name to be sure. What did Jedediah Shirley did? My parents are both teachers at the Bolingbroke primary school. They each died of fever when I was only three months. They were a pair of babies themselves. I've had the good fortune to be rescued from the Asylum by friends. We all are going to live in Marysville. They are members of the affluent Thomas family. Thomas you say? And you never met old Mrs T.? No, but young Mrs. Thomas over there is as benevolent as she is loyal. Get your bags. Anyone knows the Thomas?s place, if they know Marysville. Oh, thank you. Luisa! Violetta, boys, wake up! The Sun is shining on us this morning. The chaos that I've caused is over. I cannot believe we had to stay over at that train station. Thanks to you, Ann. I'm sorry, I vexed you, Violetta. It gives me great satisfaction to know, the inequity has been raided. I feel just like a hero-women in the novel. You talk too much. Don't be so certain, grandmother will throw you out on your head. Be nice to her she is interesting. It would be more to a point, if she were useful. Grandmother will toss us all, when she hears her nonsense. I will not worry about asylum for a little while longer. Or to imagine us all of part of a beautiful Mirage. I thank God for two or three times a minute. We're right proud of this place. Marysville is named by old Mr. Thomas. who built a mill on the count of it's always been so merry. Christopher Columbus I must be dreaming. You certainly are. There is no need to be nasty, Violetta. God's nightgown! We wondered what in heaven's name had happened to you. Now Mrs. Thomas is gone all the way into St. John looking for you. Oh, Hapzabah, no, Please don't? if she has a coronary on her way, you will never hear the end of it. Louisa Thomas! What is that? It?s the most heartrending story Please, just keep my mother-in-law calm, until she has a chance to get used to that idea. You don't meant to think I'd take in a street urchin like that? ______ You don't march in here with some stray cur that can be of use to me. But she is such a bright little creature. And her mother was a good friend of mine. I promised a little thing that she could stay with us. I'm not about to break my promise, she can do a house chores. She doesn't cross this threshold of the household. I have been waiting settlers go without went for a while. You have any trouble ? ask for Nellie. Thank you I'm grateful for all your help. Get up. Hapsapah will not let you do any house chores, but she is agree you can help out in the stables, though. Violetta will show you the barn out back. Please tell her I?m very good at washing dishes. but I'm resigned to fit into a household any way I can. What a splendid property! Hurry up, Anne. I'm just so excited to imagine, I can stay for a little while. Stables are this way. A brooke! Brooks is such a cheerful things aren't they? Always laughing even in winter under the ice. Can't you ever quit being so phony? Trashcan Anne! That's what I going to call you, because you are garbage! I would not give myself such errors in the presence of a true aristocrat myself, being a progeny of Royal Irish blood. The only royal blood you'll ever have is of my fist at in the end of your nose. You are con just like your father. You are so queenly? the test of a true noble is having such a high instep a stream of water could run right underneath it. I don't believe anybody has that, and least of all - you. My family are descendants of the warrior Monarch Queen Maeve who led the Celts into battle riding bareback like moonlight, see Queen Maeve sounds more like a witch than a queen. Besides you couldn't ride by moonlight, let alone mount a horse. Could you? You just watch. I have a way with equines. Who do you think you are? This is foolish! You can't blame me if you get yourself killed. I shall prove you're a liar or perish! Anne! Mother, she is out of control! Hepzibah!!! it's Anne!!! Charles, what the devil is going on Charles don't you have any control? But where are the grooms? Where is the stable boy? Stop, who is that? Whose horses is that? Stop this coach at once! Oh, stop, stop, please! I'm going to lose my lunch! Louisa! If this is your manner of appreciation for my munificence, you can pack your bags and go! Oh, don't excite yourself. Of course, I'm going to excite myself how long in a day go on searching hither and yon for relatives, as giddy as cats out of a bag? and, then, to come home to this mania in my front yard: Horses tearing up my garden And you driving my only son to drink! With as much upheaval I'm sure Mother, I'm sorry but, please, And don't you think for one minute that the gang of you can worm your way in here, like I'm a doormat! To take advantage of a mother's broken heart. Mrs. Thomas! Please, don't think I'm lacking in sympathy. Louisa she is neither a worm and you're not a dormant What are you rumpled in a head child? I may be rumble in spirit but not in a head Mrs. Thomas. Luisa and her children came to you, grieving for a father and a husband. The least you can do is over some pity. They have nowhere to go either. Who are you? Ann Shirley, ma'am. I should know better than to speak, but they're in just as much anguish as you. Alright, alright, no need to get yourself in such a state on our account. But There is a need. Imagine you are an orphan nowhere to go and you come to a place like this hoping an important person like yourself might grant you a chat. All right, listen. I know tomfoolery when I see it. Stand up for heaven?s sake and enough of this begging business. And don't cast my prominence up at me either. It's been an extremely difficult day and I have a right to say what is on my mind. Of course Louisa can stay. Oh, thank you, Mrs. Thomas! "Withhold not my heart from any joy." Ecclesiastes chapter 2 verse 10 Yes, I know stand up dear, and stop with the Biblical authority! Any child who can act like a pagan one minute and quote the Old Testament the next ..well, it just turns my stomach This is such a dissolute age, Louisa, don't you think? Hepzibah, come here. Why aren't my grandchildren settled in for goodness sake? Don't ogle me like that! Just can't bear my housekeeper so incompetent. How do I tolerate you? You're a walking disaster and you're never prepared for anything. I have to do everything myself. You boys are good on getting her to laugh. Go! Thank you, Anne. Could have made a more flower if I had time to think it through. Wish she were so inhospitable. Well, she needs us as much as we need a place to stay. I hope someone will always need me. We've got to get you a bath if we are ever going to persuade Hepzibahin to give you a place indoors. You are the disaster. I just had enough of your tatterwalling and your shennanigans. You know what to do, ladies. Get her in there. No, no, no! It's freezing! You just behave yourself! Louise you have some weird ideas. Her poor mother was a gifted teacher, and so the child is incredibly bright. I think that maybe she could help the children with their studies, since they missed so much school in this year. Louisa, you are so irresponsible. I refuse to be taught by a stray. I felt some responsibility to her mother. Anne's well rendered with a heart of gold. She's very odd, if you ask me. I don't have it in me to send her to another asylum. You have a head and a heart soft as my son?s. I think I'll check and see if a local family need some help. I can tutor the boys, grandmother. Your life is to be elevated above that of your parents. A girls education begins with the proper governance. I have found one. She will be here right away. She will provide a firm hand. They will make all the difference in the world to you. Enough if you don't mind? I had enough? Goodnight. My life will never be the same again. Someone left a pitcher of lemonade for the hired help. Want some? Sure, go bring me some. Please, wait here. Mrs. Thomas will see you now. What are you doing in here? I was just looking at those crows up there. You come back in here again and those crows will pick your eyes out. Go on, get out of here. Alright. You can close your notebooks now. Your grandmother wants to see all three of you for lunch. So you can break now while I mark your notebooks. The courses were so hard. I know, the math was so hard. Go put this back in the key cover of the kitchen, and then come and help with the pond well. They are missing as sure as the day is long, and I caught her loitering in the summer kitchen. Did you know this assigned key is lying anywhere? Yes. I put away the stable key in a cover an hour ago. What business was it of yours? You don't meddle with my kids. I did exactly as Mr. MakAdams told me. He said: ?Put away this stable's Key in the cover and come and help me in the pond? Which I did dutifully. Only... Only she likely mixed up the stable key with the missing key, and can't remember where she put them. Of worse that she stole them. Didn't you just steal them you're little... Hepzibah, don't you stop it? Did you catch any other set of key? Believe me, if I only being led to the block for it Only I'm not certain where the block is. I never touched any other keys. Only the stable keys. I will not allow this child to sleep in the house, until she finds the upstairs keys. She can sleep in the barn until she rots or else returns the upstairs keys. There is something else. What is it? Nothing. Ready to tell me what happened to the missing key? Yes. That's preposterous Mrs. Thomas. I am to be accused by a mischievous child who's never had a proper upbringing? Well she's getting one now. this goes beyond the mirror scolding, ma'am. Louisa, the child is a liar. I speak the truth, because, to be unjustly accused, is an assault on my good name.
