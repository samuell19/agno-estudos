Aside from the historical narrative, all characters appearing in this film are fictitious: Any relation to living persons alive or dead is coincidental The Candidate The chairman of the foundation, Adriaan Delport, the biggest Afrikaner Organisation in South Africa. Today they are choosing a new director There can only be a unanimous decision Chairing the meeting is Louwrens Niemand, decision-maker Paula Neetland doctor of the group Anton du Toit, writer and Herzog Prize winner. Wilhelm Estrerhuizen, carpenter Hermann Botha, farmer Dominique Peralt of the Dutch Reformed Church Anna Volskenk, Mother of the Volk Mr. H. P Grieg, Agent secretary of the Civil Service Professor Jannes van Viljoen, preserver of our language. Some of us have not met you Mr. LeRoux but we all give you our warmest welcome. Thank you do you have any reservations regarding Mr. LaRoux's career so far? his qualifications, research and so forth to decide unanimously decide on his appointment as director of this foundation. Miss Neetling and I asked to describe how he sees the role of the organisation. I'll think we'll appoint him immediately We give an annual R1 million for the Afrikaner cause but I feel we need better results. I have a memorandum which is a step-by-step guide how the task needs to be unpacked You do outstanding work but too few know about it It's important that our folk are aware of the task which awaits We stand on the brink of a great event But it's a changing world that we live in Everything has changed and we must look it straight in the eye without fear From now on much will be expected from every Afrikaner If I was the director of this organisation it would be my duty to make the Afrikaners ready for challenge which awaits us Any questions? My department won't be responsible for any decision here before we've properly considered Dr. Laroux's recommendations Anything else? -No doctor, just thank you for all your efforts And let me say the results we've been presented. Things look good, yes? Don't you think he has an honest face? I think we're all satisfied Would you mind stepping outside a moment, Dr., the council is now in session Stay seated please There you have it Give an Afrikaner a platform and he will enlist the Devil himself, horns, tails, the works Anything else? An inspiring message, we should all shake your hand And you, Uncle Essie? Yes, the doctor spoke well Can we make a date for him to start? -No, not yet Later. He does outstanding work but too few people know about it. Lovely words, listen: "It's important that our Volk all know of the work which awaits" Do you want us to break down everything we do? If you want to put it that way. The whole world must know of the work we do so that more people we'll convince Is this why you're always writing in the newspapers? The people still aren't interested. I thought it was modest. Dr. Jan Rooi, the one and only - and the rest of the class? The other people at your rescue centre- do they do nothing? You know the newspapers I know nothing of the newspapers and even less about you. All I know is you have a PhD, this and that and who knows what And now they want me to step, to stick my hand in the air And then a few kind words on a scrap of paper Yes we must vote and then get on with it I hope we'll be reassured of the candidates competency You can be rest assured What do you want to use this place for? No, I want to be used, put to better use Can I ask one more thing? What aspect of you do you want to put to more use? To be an trusted intermediary within our organisation Are you're a....trustworthy man? I think we've heard enough, he is not on trial I'll ask again and again and again, are you a trustworthy man? I AM, YES Such an answer is always met hopeful faces but all the newspapers report are scandals, lust and opportunism Sleeping with another man's wife, more scandals all hell breaking loose First put the Afrikaners under the magnifying glass and then if us in the inner circle can unite then some of us would be trusted I object, strongly! There's always bad eggs Enough's been said. We already decided When I talk I don't care if you listen but you don't tell me finish off! I am calling you to order Who are you to stop me speaking? You're out of order I think the council has heard enough now Can I talk or do what she says? Not because she says so but because I say so Stick to the discussion at hand Abide by the order Dr. Laroux is the discussion at hand. And I'm discussing his appointment Can I suggest that we now decide on Dr. Laroux's appointment? I'm still speaking You've said enough, old boy. And the manner in which you've addressed is not nice Anton Just don't be cheerful, okay? Just have respect, that's all Don't forget how he's helped you in your life. Must I kiss his feet? Is that what you want? Just don't be rude, that's all. Just remember you're not the only one here. I am the only person here who's disenchanted? That's free and I won't sell my free spirit for a bowl of porridge! We're all free -Free to fornicate but not to stand on the outside like me I've already thanked you sufficiently for your money Did you hear me? I owe him nothing in this life Maybe just some gratuity -Forget it I stand alone just like the candidate there. Would it be inconvenient for you to sit a bit longer -I will sit Shouldn't that man wait outside I will gladly answer any questions And sometimes villains and cannibals also have pretty faces He's making a very good impression, but then someone else here sits; a forward thinking man, The forerunner is over the line, Mrs Skenk thinks you have a beautiful open face Professor van Viljoen says he's bright and Mr. Grieg, well it's his first time here but he's satisfied as he's getting it all in notes Uncle Ethie? well, let us see He says you spoke eloquently Uncle Herman thinks the Boers will have a jolly date, the priest says you wrote a nice little book. And she just loves you for your pure energy and outlook And there you have it What more would a man want? A nice cup of tea Shall I tell you? Not cups of tea but the truth, that's what I want And sometimes it's so difficult The council must forgive me for repeating myself but is the truth not the most important? Do you care? If I can help I am glad to oblige You can by telling us if there's anything else we should know. Everything stays here in the lair There's nothing We know everything about you - give us the truth I'm not hiding anything I see it under your left hand! And what do we have here? What's all this confused bickering now? It's not something we would hope to find in an Afrikaner home, your left hand the dots He means these! It's a reform school symbol Sure there nothing more we should know? -It's been 15 years! I was in a reform school I robbed and stole cars Just for the crack? I was brought up like this - we were street kids and I had to fill my own belly And a car's not the tastiest snack is it? Could you ask Dr. Laroux that they go out now please Yes, sure Let me just make it clear that I was always aware of LaRoux's past As you know he is head of the Maguba rescue post It is only because of his past that he now stands where he is Isn't that so? I was also aware of his past, it was no revelation he had a rough upbringing We can see it but our free association is not suitable for these sorts You're not suggesting that what happened fifteen years ago should still count against him? I don't look forward to reading in the newspaper how a criminal is our new director Surprised that you take into account decades old crimes But it still leaves an impressionable stain Now nobody's surprised, now we all know everything But you all feigned surprise when you heard about his tattoo Miss Nedeling and I knew And what of you old Massey? Did you know? No, I didn't but... Oh yes I know he's a "good man" We mustn't hold his past against him I was also young and also bad I could also be in prison today - easily You've been leading us around in circles- all day long! You're constantly circling the table talking a load of nonsense Okay, you talk then I also have a past just like that man has a past I think Mr Du Toit has one too Be careful! Someone must speak up on this madness You say that we're blind and can't see a thing I tell you the man is a robber we have always made precautions against these... disgusting things. Our folk has always been known for its honesty and this man is DIShonest- he has stolen! We're discussing his future, not his past So these crimes don't matter then? It does matter and this man is not for us I'm just making a point that the marks on his hands etc. are not desirable for this post The entire situation will need to be re-evaluated, his criminal record, etc. But you'd already spoken to him? Maybe he's been hiding something from us What if there's other things we don't know about The scales have tipped, 1..2..3..4- 4 out of5 Dr. Laroux is the right man out of all the possible candidates Sit! He was dishonest I am reminded of the case of Abraham We're not talking ancestors this man is here with us. He should have told us about his past - I knew So it's you who hid this from us. Why? Can we have unanimity? Let's vote! Forget it I don't want to vote either What do you have against the candidate, Du Toit? Why so opposed? Why are you so adamant that he must be appointed? Don't you have the decency to give him a chance? -I owe nobody We can make the mistake again of sleeping when I eyes need be open! Nothing wrong with our eyes We won't be bringing the wrong man in here again!! Last time it was Neetling, he was the previous director He was our greatest strength He was hopeless, limp, simpleton - fell into every trap Is it true that hes your man? Let's have it! Spit it out! You're such a peasant sometimes You made me this way What is it, Anton? Have you forgotten all we've done? No, I remember...everything! Everything we shared We have a few more things to discuss and I'd like you to hear them We also wanted to vote. We're not ready yet, are we? I want to use this as a preamble. Are you comfortable? We know the constitution! And you? -No, my first time here "...to appeal to the man on the street our candidate must be a man on the street or worker" Just an ordinary man off the street! So that the council can clearly understand what problems there are like Uncle Essie So we can know exactly how to help Article 9 -You're just stuck to the past! "I regard the appointment of a director as very important" - Adriaan's own words "...and his appointment should always be impartial' Yes, we know! And the reason he gave us this handbook was so that we would always walk the right path "Article 10: before deciding a candidate he must be put under a rigorous test" My father's determination has always been the standard -CRAP! You have no right to speak to a woman that way and insult her uncle I'll shake you inside out Please, uncle Essie The founder had only one test - the director must be a true Afrikaner By God I say he is one. I am dead sure. On what grounding are you dead sure? He is an Afrikaner, can't you see he's an Afrikaner!? Afrikaner isn't exactly written on his face! What about his language, his demeanour? His school, his culture, his politics? Other things too- things which you can't write on clipboards and hang around his neck! Do you all say the same? Do you agree he is a 'true Afrikaner? A true Afrikaner doesn't behave the way you just behaved! What is a true Afrikaner then, Reverend? He must be an upright Christian, in our church or one of the three sister churches A true Afrikaner Did you find the answer, Dr.? The strength of an Afrikaner comes from within Not to be paraded about like a baboon And you're destined to be the big man, In the monuments, in the press unions? I am the protector of our language And shoved it down the Volks' throats I fight for the Afrikaner language Folk unity for English and Afrikaans hand in hand? The language is irrelevant Only the politics matter What are your politics, Doctor? I belong to the National Party His politics are right! An SA Party member can be an Afrikaner too or how, people? Yes, and Afrikaner can have any political views Who of us are more pure? SAPP, Nationalists, etc. Who were the rebels? Let us look: General Louis Botha, icon.. You shut your mouth about our forefathers And here we have General Herzog- remember the dissention he causes- tearing our people in two? We all stood in the middle of that struggle. You weren't even born yet And here is General Jan Smuts who didn't quite humiliate the Afrikaners but... Mr. Niemand? I don't see him here. The founder didn't want him here Is Smuts not an Afrikaner? He always just worked for England I am a Jan Smuts man and also an Afrikaner - he worked for us all, not just England! Here are the proud leaders of the Afrikaner folk who brought us to where we are now Dr. Malan, advocate Strijdom - Lion of the North, And the man who gave us the Republic: Dr. Verwoerd. What a proud day, professor, when we became a republic- a free people I thanked the Lord that day but I also thanked the men and women of the past. And Jan Smuts too, just as much as the others I don't think we should forget it I've always been a Jan Smuts man Church, school, language, politics, all in little holes You say we put all those people in holes? This is where he belongs, this is what he should believe Each has his own calling What does the state say? I've had enough of clarifying the Afrikaner's Afrikaansness And still we box people into holes Because you want to degrade the folk in your undertaking If I want to degrade my folk I must degrade myself being a member I'm a weak Afrikaner? Why because I ask questions, because I don't follow the herd? I must let others decide for me? You can decide yourself Oh no, I'm not allowed, I must just sit in my box We can't all be leaders If the leaders speak you must be quiet or they kick you out as a trouble-maker That shoe fits you well What are you then? I am me I hoped you would become one of those leaders, but you've become a nightmare And now I'm irritating you, you put your money on the wrong horse Why? You wouldn't have put your hopes on me without a good reason What was it about me? Or are you too ashamed to tell us? Whisper in my ear, I won't say a word I helped an reform school child One day I will find out the truth You can't hide the truth forever Your truth lies in the dustbins of Freedomtown Is there nothing you still believe in? I am Anton du Toit, the bastard child without bonds And I don't give a hell about you or Paula Needeling's beautiful proud things I only trust myself, just me! What do you want with this confrontational manner? The truth, always just the truth Does the state seek the truth? I won't answer any more of your mindless questions Are the heavens going to fall? What are you, man? I'm an Afrikaner! How many Afrikaners are there in the country? Can lay my hands on the statistics right away but... With a record of statistics which are nationwide states that 60% of the country speaks Afrikaans What percentage of that 60% are coloured? The Coloureds were not included But they were included in research by the Afrikaans Speaking Movement The Coloureds are considered as a group with their own customs and heritage Isn't about coloureds no matter what nation they are I have discussed this with the government I am the government, you are the government and Mrs Volskenk is All of us are because we support our own We support a proposal which will give every white a right to self-determination Separate from the coloureds' right to self-determination Could you please bring us another tape? I have two "Kaffirs" on the farm who only speak Afrikaans, doesn't make them Afrikaners! Sir, the correct word is not Kaffirs but Bantu How things have changed Yes, we give far too much to the black man - everything he sees he gets Is it not our duty as Christians to give a helping hand? Yes, but not to shake it We must all make sacrifices, Mr. Esterhuizen My son who's a runner at school... Yesterday bought him running shoes from the frozen funds. Can we move forward? Speed things up a bit please Do you also make sacrifices, doctor? Are you another tight-arsed Afrikaner? I have always sided with the Folk and felt I belonged, I helped build the foundation previously... Ten little Afrikaners - who will be shot first? We're in trouble, we would like you to work for us but wouldn't we be mistaken? Afrikaners are down-trodden- they love parties and then they make so Test me more, sure, but you won't drag my Afrikaansness through the khakibush Not proud of my past but I am not ashamed to say I'm an Afrikaner I'll no longer sit and punish myself for this man How can Afrikaners enter the future without being willing to proudly display our business in public? Don't ask me if I'm an Afrikaner, ask me if I will work for my people and I say yes But I won't work on my knees. With pleasure give my post to someone else - I won't grovel Wait, doctor! I say thank you - you're a fighter, come back please! Dr., my apology. -I am sorry Don't you say sorry, it is we who are ashamed On behalf of the board give me this man so we can fight in the streets Who will you fight? -Our enemies We must protect our own Isn't there space for other people? Never! It's an Afrikaner organisation Dr. one more question and then I'll be quiet It's a miracle I'm also laughing at how much a person can talk Can we get our final question over with? Actually it's nothing. Dr., are you married? I'm getting married in two months Congratulations! Do we know her? I doubt it, she's Miss Smith. English or Afrikaans? She's English Speaker- why was this information withheld?! This is surely not an important issue Nobody answers my questions! Why was this English woman hidden from us? She wasn't hidden from you, she's his bride-to-be You two have, so help me, smuggled him in!! Control yourself Professor, we've had just about enough Thanks Doctor, you can go on, we will inform you of the decision Good day ladies and gentleman And now Mrs Niedland? You didn't know everything about him You dug deep, eh Anton They're going to marry in 2 months, her name is Jackie - Jackie Smith I tell you a hundred times a day - watch what you do Be careful, this stuff is poisonous Look at his eyes Can you open your eyes? It burns terribly, madam. We'll quickly take him to the orphanage They'll have a better doctor You two, don't just stand around, spray! We don't have all day - look at that man's eyes What's going on here? We're spraying. You can go, everything's fine Spraying again without goggles I see Everyone's wearing goggles How do you feel? -very sore, sir They were spraying next to each other and some got into his eyes -A simple mishap Take off that mess! And I suppose you're completely innocent? You could have blinded him Who was on your other side? Sorry, sir? -who was next to you?! Are you going to tell me? I was And what did you see? He slipped What happened in the city today? Make sure he finds a bed and gets a doctor Come on, come help me They'll let me know. And if they say no? -They won't Why is this hoist lying here? Chrisjan is fast asleep Do you want me to end my days in such a place? Every day I just deal with other people's problems (Boystown: famous South African reform school) There's plenty more to do But there's many who can do the Foundation's work Every day I fought but one fight - to give my language recognition If he got his chance he would ignore my language completely Look people we have all pulled out weight the past years. Why speak ill of the English suddenly? The Afrikaner pushed and the Englishman ran alongside You're right Prof. Today we hold the hopes of the English society We fought the struggle alone they were too scared to know us Now its suddenly "very fashionable'' Just let it be known that the Afrikaner today has important responsibilities in our countries policies You just talk about money - what of our heritage? That is very important to me. I also married and Englishwoman but never severed ties with my Afrikanership She's a good woman We have three children She speaks a little Afrikaans Proud woman What have we here? A snake in our busom I think this is your first and last visit with our Mr. Griek We always had to fight to keep the Afrikaner Folk pure Let's fight the Boer War again Talk is cheap. And I like that you sometimes rebel against us all Rev., the truth always stands alone But at times you are hasty - without a past we have no future There is the greatest Afrikaner of us all. Yes, he said not let the past keep us from the future Lest we forget Kruger ever lived van Riebeek ever landed here We can also forget what happened 2000 years ago When the Christ child was born and died on a cross That our lives mean anything and that the Bible is more than a pile of papers Not easy as blowing out candles If things had been different we would sit in darkness -It's already dark! Let's turn on the lights before our souls are lost God is jealous of everything which is His, including our souls. Don't ever say that again My watch's time and the clock on the wall don't match Quarter to seven and high time that we now decide people That's no reason to make a hasty decision. This candidate is the right man, but his wife is included Can we not invite her in for an interview? A very good suggestion I have nothing more to discuss Very well, we will adjourn until tomorrow morning 9AM? Will it be quick? -Yes, they just want to look at your eyes I won't go blind, will I? Do exactly what the doctor tells you It's a terrible accident - you should have worn goggles; he's in hospital He won't forget that it was your fault Poor Karel Rise! Sit The doctor says there's a chance Karel could lose his sight. The time for jokes is over What exactly happened? I was at the pump when Ariel called me -You saw nothing? I told you he slipped. Yes, sir I'm asking for the last time It was my fault Are you sure? Mr Laroux said he'll go blind Mr. Isaac bumped into me You can go in Why Isaac? -I say he's lying But you wouldn't believe me No, because you're wicked But I don't have five dots on my hand This time I won't protect you, you're going back to jail, back to where you belong Ensure his things are ready; he must pack tomorrow I want to discuss something - it's important Did they decide? I'll see you tomorrow. I probably should have told you It's not Jackie, but other things We can't continue like this I want you to come Come to my art studio at 9 o' clock You're working late They want to see me - the council I'm going to dine with me. Let me get dressed. I'm sorry about today. If you want the job the I support you I've realised that I have the soul of art in my hand Like the Spaniards say: what makes an artist great? Poverty, suffering! Here Paula? There's nothing. I see it's just bin lids, old nails and thorns we don't read the same books. There's an artist I'm looking for. You know that small town I've moved to? You should see the people The weather is fabulous. Come with me and we'll write a book. Your sherry Cheers! You've had a very successful day. I'm right You'll keep at it? The great intellectual, Anton du Toit. Open, everyday, vulgar and emotive. Jealous? You're enjoying this. I'm a woman. Ettiene's work's in decline don't you think? Yes but you'll still buy one Why of course! He'll come work for us without the wife. 1,2,3 and she's out? From head to tail I'm thinking, let's say we sell him on, with his wife then you won't get him anyway We'll set them up Both out together Together they're in I'm warning you, don't I'm only started, tomorrow is your turn I'm going to rip you all apart Then I'll rip you apart - be careful! All of you, you, Niemand, your father- the Foundation! Why? Because you want to know? No, so that we can all lie together Go! Close the door. Your turn! They say I'm going to jail tomorrow. I don't really want to go. I want to stay here. It's my last chance. Would you like to go to jail? -No, Isaac Nobody does. Karel isn't really blind, I only frightened you. I didn't really bump into him. Get it? He will believe you. What do you say? No! What do you say?! I won't It's easy I'm staying here I'm going to jail because of your big mouth? Listen to me? Remember what we saw? That Jack didn't see? LeRoux will soon be going back to his other woman. Say to him you lied or I'll tell Jackie what we saw. I won't lie again. I'd long left those gates and you still never told him! You tell him everything or I'll break your neck, bastard! If you don't tell him I'll cut you to pieces! The boys have been fighting, I think it's about the accident. Isaac? Never mind, he's leaving tomorrow. It might be better if you stay here tonight you've been here six years- you deal with it! I don't know how but... See, sir, You seem troubled. It's your friend Jackie; they're going to tell her and want me to lie. Isaac's going to tell her. Tell me all about it Isaac and I saw Mr. LaRoux I think I should keep quiet - it's probably nothing. He was with Mrs Neetling Isaak and I were working alone. We couldn't help seeing them Now Isaac's going to tell Jackie. But I won't lie again -Yes, everything becomes rotten here. And you keep on at it. You won't tell Jackie. She's the last decent person left here It's Isaak -Isaak? Leave him to me I'll be damned! How fortunate that we've bumped into each other tonight, eh, Isaak? Take the light away -No I can't see you too well without. Looks like you've got lost It's warm inside -Warm? Strange that I'm also hot tonight Just a walk outside -And me alongside you Right past Jackie's room. You'll find your way back, surely? I can't see Your bedroom's down this way. If you decide to make another detour tonight you know? Accidentally I'll hang around here by Jackie. If you decide, you know? Then I'll show you the road again And don't hassle Kallie tonight okay? Almost forgot about him. And then you chose her; we've long been in love. I loved her before I met you. And now you're here with me. I wonder if Jackie Smith knows. You said we'd discuss the meeting And all the other times? Why did you come? I didn't think things would go this far And now it has gone that far. What now? I'm still in love with her. And tomorrow the council must decide. They need to meet Jackie Smith tomorrow morning, 9am I'll bring her. You can still back out. But it will still mean you both together I think you're stubborn. But then what about us? It could be the beginning of something big. I can give you everything. And the rest of the council? They'll do as I say. -Even Anton du Toit? Him too, yes. I will give you all you want. It's all that I desire. I'll get this position but I then it must because I was the right man and no other reason What about us? If I'd met you before Jackie it would have been different. So be it, if that's what you want then you can't have it. I want to speak to you... The doctor says Isaac could die. Kallie hit him with bars and chains - I told you to stay. I warned you about trouble brewing. He has a hole in his head Is he in hospital? He's still there. The doctor's busy with him. And now Kallie has run away. I'll go and search but where? But I'll get him. You can go back now. I know where to find Kallie. I must go Will I see you again? Tomorrow morning Evening Kallie It's me You must come back. No, sir. I'm not dragging you out here. You must decide for yourself. Isaak is alive. - Isaak is dead, man No, he's alive. Don't try and hide from the police. Very well, hide in this hole and let the police chase you but never be a man I didn't want to tell Isaak. Why did you? You were suddenly too busy to speak to me anymore Now I have nobody. I'm staying here. I can help you. You could be a murderer I won't go to jail. You won't I'd rather... Don't be stupid Please leave me now. Good night. They must be introduced without his fiancee. Understand LaRoux? That's a problem -He still wants the post It's important that you ask him to break off the engagement I can't I really want this Please Laurence -I don't know You'll be supervising him tonight - tell him the truth! It's a difficult situation -Yes it is. If you don't do it then I will have to. What did the doctor say? -They just operated, we don't know Shouldn't we take him to hospital? -We can't move him. Thanks miss, that's all now. I knew where Kallie would be hiding. I just want to be with you Sorry I wasn't here What did the council say? -They want to meet you You'll come tomorrow... We can't go on like this I'm so scared I'll protect you. The hour is nigh - everyone ready? You'll behave yourself today Bring in Miss Smith -You can go in. Ladies, gentlemen, this is Miss Smith Sit You must excuse us, Dr. I'm sorry, she's a bit nervous We'll look after her Welcome and thanks for coming. The board would like to become acquainted with you. No need to be scared -Thank you I'm still scared Never mind - we're also scared of you. -I'm glad I heard you were English but I see you're a Boer girl. I am pleased to speak in Afrikaans. That's a very kind gesture. You also work at the rescue post, yes? -Yes, miss. A social worker? -I'm a secretary there but I help with other things. How long have you been there? -2 years. And before that? We want to know more about you, understand? we're from Natal - I came here to attend high school. Which school? Park Town Girls High School I then went to college but wanted to do social work. Are her politics important enough to ask about them? Do you think this board is concerned about her character, her origins or her ideals? Oh no, its the politics, are you liberal or conservative - do you hate enough? Do you believe in Apartheid? You idiot, it's every Christian's duty to believe in Apartheid. Do you see? And the other millions of Christians who don't believe in Apartheid? And the people in this land? Where would you be today without Apartheid? This is a traditional conviction of the country This isn't now relevant, please. Everything is relevant - she will be just as much a part of us as LaRoux. Bravo, do you like throwing stones at her? What's wrong, Anton? The truth painful? You're in a hurry to win It was almost too easy No further questions - she loves him He loves her. Nothing else is important. No, we must know everything To put her in a box? -If need be, yes What happened? He sat here and offered nothing. You asked her to leave her church, and stand naked They're all against us, these outsiders, streaming in here every day. Soon we'll drown in immigrants. She's not an immigrant, she's a person. But your ancestors were immigrants They didn't have crosses round their necks. We can have an exception. Her, then another and another, and soon this organisation will be for the Jews and the Catholics... We are the cream of this land. Then I'm ashamed - is this how Christians talk? If we're such good upstanding Afrikaners let us ensure that we live accordingly. Let's win her for the case of our own church Now we're talking. She carried herself well No professor, the reverend is right Our tent is filling up. Let's count Essie, Botha, you, me, and also these two Now we're six, Paula Wasn't there more to ask the candidate? No, I don't think so. You've forgotten? Ask the candidate to enter There's nothing to discuss with him Unfortunately, we're in a difficult situation. We're hesitant, it's your fiancee The council feels that... she says she's a Catholic. It's a problem, we don't feel she belongs. Only three think so shut up! I'm the chairman We would like to appoint you but would you end your engagement? We didn't ask that I'm asking! The chairman asked me a question! This is not relevant to his appointment. You didn't have the right to ask his fiancee... -Keep quiet! We have an important issue to discuss Shame on you, chairman! We'll go back and marry - what more do you want? And after ten years? Then what? I'll still be with the boys. I'm the only person who can work with them. This is how it will be. I want 20 bags here and then dump the rest every hundred feet Are you back? How is it with Isaak, sir? Where were you? Look at you. -Is he still alive? He's alive! give him a few days he'll be back in trouble. Mr. Laroux said he was going to die. Then I'm a murderer! Yes, but you've redeemed yourself. They won't hang me, will they? In this world you never know when to do the right thing. I should have lied last night to Mr. LaRoux I still want to live, sir. I didn't want to kill Isaak Look at your filthy hair! And you need to eat. Isaak, it's me Will you forgive me? Please don't die I thought it was all just a misunderstanding. -No, Christiaan Was it not to be? -No. Christiaan, I have to leave. Then I will go too -Someone will need to stay for the boys. You'll see. Jan will stay here, he'll return. Jackie, don't go! Someone will come replace me; probably speaks better Afrikaans than me. It will be much better for Jan You will find someone better than me Like Mrs. Neetling. -Never! never! I don't care if she's yellow, green, etc. or what he drinks You're all hypocrites You lot, writing about sex, can't you think about anything else? Our books were always the purest; now it's all ruined. Like this new book of yours, The Night Ape. They should burn it I didn't catch the name of the book - this sex book. The Night Ape, but don't let your wife catch you It's just for the record! You've read it ? no. But the newspapers say it's filth. My husband and I read good books. About the flowers and birds in the field? You need to explore the world and find out how people really live. You can't tell me anything about this life. We travel a lot. Last year in Paris we became acquainted with your "sex". Young girls were flirting with my husband. I was so embarrassed that my husband took me back to the hotel to rest. Poor man, took me hours to get back Exhausted, I'm sure. Of course I'm also tired of all this conformity Keep quiet -How can you keep quiet while people next to you lie and cheat? The voice of the church is not heard. How much longer? Until this church is saved, the rot rooted out Don't speak to my father like that. One last thing: Be careful, remember what I told you Your father always sat in the front of the church Adriaan Delport - folk hero! Man of the nation, respected Where did your father's wealth come from? Estimates of transaction, broken agreements His whole life he spat to lubricate the torture racks And on his deathbed he knew how to spend his days feasting This is where this organisation's money came from Blood money - used to be a place in heaven I really must object to his manner What do any of you know about that man? And what do you know of Mr. Nieman and Mrs Neetling here? Come on, man up and tell us about yourselves! Tell him Lourens, tell him what he already knew last night. I can't Then stand like a man and defend my father! Tell us the other side of the story. I'll tell you the other side of the story. I did something in my life where I sold my soul to Adriaan Delport... When he died he appointed the business to a black man. Now they will learn the other side of the story. Your side. You remember your dead husband, Paula? Or how he died? That's enough -No! just the beginning She broke him because he was too slow for him. Remember, he couldn't work six months before his death. Because her bedroom was locked. She mocked him if he was in her way He committed suicide You didn't know about it, Paula made sure. And I also made sure. And now LaRoux is the next sacrificial lamb. The man she wants to turn around, get drunk, tied down until he's worth nothing You must sit down I can't, I have broken my chains. Last night she told me to select the candidate without his fiance. God knows I even tried but he was too honest Now you can speak Paula. Have you won now, Anton? Are you finished? Achieved all your goals? I warned you last night I also warned you And now? We'll have to see Will you tell the lady waiting to come inside please. Do we have to dive back into the mud? Who is the woman, Paula? Let's say she's the final truth You wanted to see me? But all these people? All friends. Morning! There's someone here who you know well. Morning, Sonja. You're also here - all well? How long has it been? Many years eh? Here's someone else you must meet. Anton, its your mother. I knew you became an important man - I'm so proud. And my father? -No! Let me guess! Let me guess which bastard who left to grow up so alone in the world. Without a name, love, without an anchor Nothing And then, you gave me everything. The will of a bastard child to climb to the top, to fight, fall, and fight again. So people would say: Alone Therefore I say... Thank you, father. Goodbye Anton du Toit, man without ties.... you've dug your own grave. I didn't mean to What are you doing here, Krisjan? Jackie came back, she's busy packing Kallie came? He's with Isaak. Isaak's dying. Kallie's a murderer now. You can go now. Kallie killed Isaak because he threatened to tell Jackie about your affair. Kallie protected you when you were caught with that Neteling woman. Last night was the last time But Isaak's still dying. It's his own fault. Is that what you do... climb down from above and trample everyone below? Look! Another day gone and there's three down. Isaak, Jackie and Kallie. I'm not an educated man, but I tell you you're wrong! You need to decide now. If you're going or sorting out your mess by us. And tell Jackie you were a fool! Eaten up by your own ambition. Is she truly leaving? Yes, she only had eyes for you I loved you both, but now I am too heartbroken I don't want you for a friend anymore The last few days we fought a lot. Lots of arguments. But when the yelling's died down and the ink dried. then we remain still Afrikaners. This is the gift of our Folk The will to ask and answer, to differ and shake hands. Let us have the will to make the right decision Outside stands a man and his fiance A man in the eyes of every Afrikaner would be a proud asset. Let us vote. I give my department's blessing. I vote for him. Me too. I say yes. Professor? Mr. Speaker, you know my principles. There's the girl. I wish I could but I vote against and with that I bow out of this council But then we must lose you and we need fighters. You won't reconsider? I will keep on fighting but now I must leave so you can pick impartially. Now its you two. Paula and Anton. What say you? No, what do you say? You have won. Why aren't all laughing? Why aren't you screaming hooray? I'm also in a hole now with my mother and father. And if I vote now I'm going to hurt people. And I won't again, Paula. I must vote and therefore say yes for the candidate and yes for the council. And if you want it so yes for everything beautiful in the Folk. Now you stand alone, Paula. Completely isolated Now it's you. I wish I could help you, I know what it's like to love I hurt you terribly. We hurt each other. We must never again. No. Sir? Kallie, come What is it? -I've come Isaak is dead, sir I need your help, sir. The council wants to see you immediately. So Isaak's dead. Please, sir. Come Wait here. You waited long, do excuse us. The council has made the following decision: It was unanimously decided to make you the new director. Each of us offers you the warmest welcome. It's a huge honour which I've received and I'm sure it was a hard decision. But it's also difficult for me now. Today a young Afrikaner boy came to me and said "Sir I need your help." And I can help him single-handedly. I must postpone my appointment to the post. Now I must chose. I am sure you would rightly expect me to fulfil the Afrikaner ideal. But my duty lies with the young man outside. With the many others like him who our folk can't lose. I cannot accept the appointment Goodbye sir. Thank you. Goodbye Paula
