Gasoline, made from cow manure. - Oh, oh, hey don't die, no, no, no. Oy, shot in the hemorrhoids, killed like a dog. The microfilm, no, ah, there it is. Microfilm. [upbeat music] [suspenseful music] You've got to help me, he's been shot, murdered, murdered! Just come, come and see for yourself please. Of course he's dead. No mistake I'm sure. The corpse is driving away. Stop, stop, come back here you corpse! Will you listen, see he's driving off. You're full of shit, I'm not crazy. Damn microfilm, now he's gonna jerk my hose off.

[upbeat music] - [Narrator] I knew this could only mean trouble. - Come in. - Do you mean come in or push in? - It makes no difference to me. [speaking in foreign language] - What a beautiful bottom I've found. - But not now, I must milk the cows. - Oh, that's marvelous, and after them you can milk me. [upbeat music] - You see how easily we could have killed you Professor? You're lucky it was a knock out dart. I hope we've taught you a lesson. Give us the formula now, okay? - I don't have the formula. - Well, in that case dear Professor, you leave us no choice, we'll have to kill you. - Well, then you have a real problem, you see, for if I am dead, then the formula is also dead. - You're getting me mad Professor. [clicking tongue] Now look, tell me where the formula is. Where's the formula? I'll break your head. Where is it? - Oh is she cute. - Huh, concentrate man, the formula, the formula. - How can I think of formulas with a naked woman prancing about? - Knock it off Professor, you're too old for that. I want that formula. - I haven't got it. - Where did you hide it? - Take care of the car, I'll handle it. - Okay. - [Sally] Dear Professor. - [Professor] Yes, luscious bite. - Herr Professor, darling. Professor you're my type. Intellectual men arouse me. Would you like me to stroke your sliderule. - Yes, go ahead. - I will if you'll. - Oh, for you anything. - Uh huh, and the formula, you'll tell me where it is. - Positively not. - But Professor. - No, no. - It's just a little formula. For me? - But it's just not with me. - Where is it? - I don't have it with me now, really. But let's not worry about a silly little formula. - What did you do hide it at the station? - Hide it, with that mad fool? [chuckles] I wouldn't do that. I am not that silly. The formula is hidden where you'd never, ever look for it and I'll never tell you where. - We'll see about that. Lock him in the trunk. - Right. [Professor shouting] - God damn it, where did he throw it? It could be valuable. Here microfilm, here microfilm. Come to Sandy. Ah, it makes synthetic petrol. If I find it, maybe it's worth a million. All right Sandy you must think a little. Where in this place would you hide? You just wait, I'll find you. The murderers, the formula, they want the formula. [man shouting] They'll kill me, unless, unless, unless I get 'em first. My god. - Stupid bloody ladder, shoot. [grunting] [clanging] - Mein Fuhrer. - Mein who? - You want me to wash your socks? - I've done harm. Xaver! Xaver, I didn't mean it wake up. It was a mistake, wake up. [panicked grunting] Here Xaver. - I'm washing them, I'm washing them. That's enough water. - Are you all right? - Stop, stop it, stop it. - I'm sorry, I thought you were the murdering spies. - That water went past my mouth, up my nose and everywhere. What do you think you are doing? - You want some whiskey for a little chaser? - Oh I might, a little tiny taste, but just for medicinal purposes, that's all. - Here, here, drink this. - Thank you. - Huh, it's nice. [Xaver mumbling] - Hey give me that bottle back. - Now come on, please don't drink the whole freaking bottle. A man's been murdered and you finished my favorite schnapps. - Ah yes, because I just need this bottle for my evidence. - For Christ's sake. - You don't suppose I drink this just because I wanted a drink of whiskey do you? Here, hold this while I find my pencil. Hmm, let's see, murdered you just said. - Okay. - Just a minute. - But that's awful it - Wait, just - happened over there. - a second I've just dropped my pencil. - Where? - On the ground you fool. - I can't believe this, you lose your pencil when you're supposed to be finding clues. Oh there's still some left. [exclaiming] - [Xaver] Ah, here it is, I found it. - So did I. - What did you find, tell me. - The formula. - What's with this formula? - It's for, for, say for Pete's sake, that automatic. Stick that heater in there before you shoot us. - It's not loaded, I'll show you it's not loaded. See there. [gun firing] [frightened gulping] - Ah, it feel so good to be milking both of you this way. [both groaning] - [Kuhhirtin] Doctor, doctor. - Oh, what's this, I think there's something strange going on here. I think I'll go and look. It might be those crooks of Sandlers and what is this? - [Tino] I'm coming, I'm coming. - Halt! [speaking in foreign language] What's this all about? - It's a menage a trois idiot. - Don't swear at me you foreigner. I saw you both screwing that cow. - So, it's a bi-sex with a bison. We're all consenting adults. - How about doing it inside, at home, behind closed doors. - We've tried, but the cow, she's too big for the door. - Ah ha, now you admit that you're a pervert, huh? [Tino speaking in foreign language] We know how to deal with people like you around here. Yeah, give me your passport. - My passport? It's missing. - Ah ha, you're probably a spy. Now who are you spying for? - A spy, me? I'm an American Italian. - Yeah, yeah, that's right Mafioso. It makes no damn difference to me you hear. - Ah, but my friend has passport, I'll call him. Emil, come on out. - What's up Tino? - Don't ask questions. - Come here. - Come right here. I hope he's got it, - Yeah, sure - otherwise the prison. - I'm coming now. [grunting] - And what seems to be the big problem? - I'll tell... [dramatic music] Nothing, nothing. I'll, I'll, I'll see you later. [both chuckling] - How was the milking girl? - Oh, I never found out. I was interrupted as I was about to come. I'll have to try again tomorrow. - When's my turn Tino? - Take it easy I'll find you one. Leave it to me to find the one big enough for you huh? I'll let you know when I do. [upbeat music] - Here's your beer Franz. - Thanks Zenzi dear, how about a little action now. - Will you quit that Franz, I'm working, please. - Can't you get off work for a little fun? Or let's see if we can do it here this way huh? - Yeah, but you need a Zenzi special. [gasping] [chuckling] [upbeat music] - [Narrator] Sherlock Holmes said always look through the local paper for suspects and there's one now. - Zenzi, hold on, wait a minute. I want something to eat. A blue plate and a beer. - Okay Sandy. - The boss, where is he? - He's over there. - Oh yeah, thank you. Huber! - Who did that? Sandler, what are you doing? - Shh, I'll tell you, but you must keep it a secret. You must keep it a secret. - Uh huh, a woman. - Huber, we could become rich. - Rich! - Not so loud, someone could be listening. Spies are everywhere around here. You, you must promise me not to tell anyone. - Don't I always keep our secrets? [humming] - Now for instance, I didn't tell your wife about your mistress. - Shut your mouth. - [Customer] Frauline, another beer please. - Okay. [gasping] You're so anxious, you can get your spaghetti yourself. This is somebody's order. There you are, now you can place your order mister. - I would expand this hotel, I could get some happy hookers too. - Now, just a second, we'd better check out some things, but I haven't got the right equipment. So perhaps your projector would work. - You want my still projector? - I'm talking about a tiny little piece of microfilm. - Fooey. - Why do you say that? - [Huber] I'm not getting mixed up with any of your dirty films. - [Sandler] I'm talking about microfilms, not beaver films. - I know how you make your money. - Now please, give me that soup plate. I'm saying it's a little microfilm containing a formula worth millions. It'll make gas from crap. - It what? - I'm telling you from bullshit, it makes gasoline. - How so? - Huber, this product will be revolutionary. Think of that. - Sounds good let me see it. - You don't expect me to show it to you here. - Here's your dinner Sandler. - Thank you. - Wait a minute, that's not yours. - Just put it down thanks. Listen, I'm going to make you a proposal okay. - Oh so. - You're kid has a projector for enlargements right? You make it available and we're in business. - Sure, okay we can do that. - Good, where is this formula? - [Sandler] Leather shorts. - Leather shorts? - Keep it quiet, I've told you spies. I pinned it inside. Shh, if they try to find it, they'll have bad luck. Wait, that's my food. [bell dinging] - Why are we stopping here? - This is as nice a place as any. Maybe we can find some women and have some fun. - We haven't got much money left you know. - Emil, have I ever let you down? The girls will treat us. There must be a piece for you and a piece for me. - Oh, I don't believe it. - Don't worry about it. First, I know I can find a way into those Bavarian bushes. - You think you can. - What do you think? [grunting] - Oh? - Just my bag, come on, give me a coin. - Our very last mark. Now we got nothing left. - Don't worry, isn't it beautiful, this lovely landscape? - [Emil] Sure, great, but what are we gonna do, eat the land? - [Tino] Don't worry, if things go as I planned, we will soon be frolicking in that bush garden and just look at all those Bavarian bushes. - Yeah, nice, but we can't eat those bushes. - You'd be surprised. Look at that, a man could find all he wants in this wonderful country. Hey, look what we found. - Empty, nothing, now what do you suggest? - Hey look, some Bavarian bush right there. Hey, need a good bush whacker? Uh huh, watch this. Hey, hey, hey! [upbeat music] Senorina, I'd like to give your lovely Bavarian bush a feel okay? - Get stuffed runt. - Oh please, I'm enthralled by your Bavarian bush. I must have it! [shouting] - Sorry you flipped over me kid, but no thanks. - Have anymore ideas Tino? - Of course, let me think. - Oh, now I'll show you what's gonna make us rich. - [Huber] Oh, in there? [chuckling] - Laugh go ahead, I'll bet I could show those spies a few things. - Is that it? - Put it in. [both exclaiming] - It seems a bit complicated, do you understand it? Do you Sandy? - Hmm, might be chemicals. - Could the pharmacist read it, or the doctor? - Hmm, and our millions they will shrink if we cut in the doctor and the pharmacist. - Hid it in a pair of leather shorts. - But which pair of leather shorts. - I've been thinking you know. - Ah, don't think too hard, you may strain your scrotum. - Okay baby, what's your plan. - I think best in bed you know that. Especially while I'm screwing. Are you up to it super agent? - Well, I don't mind balling, when it's for a good purpose Sally.

Doc, you go around the rear, quick. - Okay chief. - Yes, you go, I'm in charge here, don't you forget that. - Now we know where the Professor is hiding. How do we get the formula? - I don't know. I have to think. [upbeat music] - [Heiner] I guess I know what that means. I wish you could think on your feet like everybody else, instead of on the flat of your back. [upbeat music] Once more into the breech. - You said it. [upbeat music] - [Professor] Ah yes, I thought of how to make gasoline out of bull shit when I worked for the Pentagon in Washington. [steady dripping] - Well, I'll be a chimpanzee it works. - Phew, it stinks in here, like a, like a refinery. - Yeah, we're almost finished actually, it must boil a little longer - Ah - And then of course we must add a few more ingredients. - Isn't this very expensive? - I found that the path to riches often requires that the seeker infest a little bit of money. - Yeah, of course, that's right. - And what'll we call it, it has to have a name. - Horse or shit regular, there is also horse shit- - [Sandler] Oopa. - Don't touch that! Stupid. - Oh, oh, oh, hey Professor, I promise, I promise, I'll never do it again. [grunting] - I'm tired. [groaning] Have you got an idea yet? - Oh, it's almost come. [groaning] [chickens clucking] [exclaiming] I've got a big idea. - [Heiner] Thank god.

[steady dripping] - Now that I'm a millionaire, I'm gonna buy a Cadillac. - It smells like money. - Oh, please, do you want to blow us all up? - Professor, I just wasn't thinking. - Pardon me please, here are your eggs. - Shh, no young lady. - Go lady go. - I can't be bothered, wait over there, over there. - Amazing the most plentiful thing in the world is bullshit and we make it into gas, isn't it marvelous? Professor [speaking in foreign language] it just takes a little of this pure glyphin, gryphon, right, then runs it through kind of a glass. - A refinery. - Menagerie, bull shit then makes pure gasoline. - [Sally] You crazy old farts, you're burning the formula. - The, the, the formula! - The formula you stupid bastard. - There goes our millions. - No need to panic [speaking in foreign language] we're not defeated yet. And here [speaking in foreign language] we have the first half liter of [speaking in foreign language] With this sample I can reconstruct the formula at any time I want. - [Sandler] Bravo. - Thank you, thank you. - Oh, the bottle, catch her. - [Sandler] Where the hell do you think you're going, come back here, she's escaping. - She's the spy - She's getting away - Catch her. - Hold my muffler. - Here, here take this to the cleaners. [upbeat music] - [Professor] Which way did she go? - [Sandler] We've got to catch here. - [Pharmacist] I don't know. - The spies went that a way. - Come on hurry. - [Professor] This is a catastrophe, I think she went this way. - I'll go get Doc. - Hey, wait a minute, that looked like the spy to me. - Let's go. - Boy, when I catch her I'm gonna break her god damn neck. - There you are. Ah good, we'll head her off at the pass vamanos. - [Xaver] Huber, follow me. - Wait, which cleaners did you want me to take this to? [gasping] - Super Dick, I'm afraid the formula's been completely destroyed, you'll find in front of the drug store, a bottle. It's a sample of the gasoline, I'll meet you at the car, 10 four. - Ah ha, oh, you stay there or I'll shoot. [passing gas loudly] Oh my god what happened? I think I shit in my pants. How am I gonna explain this to my wife? [giggling] - [Claudia] Oh Lois what a sensuous mouth you have. - [Lois] The better to eat you with my dear. - [Claudia] Oh Lois what a big screwdriver you have. - [Lois] The better to screw you with my dear. - Oh excuse me is there another way out? - Oh, thank you. - [Claudia] Oh Lois, give me more.

[suspenseful music] [all shouting at once] - [Doc] We'll make sure your balls are in a sling, thief. Come back you mother grabbing formula thief. - [Pharmacist] The cleaners was closed. - I saw this done on television. Stand aside, you've gotta be sure that the rope is low to the ground, that's important. - Oh, I see, that's very clear, and then what? - When the spies come you pull it. [screaming] - [Doc] Jesus Sandler, what stinks? [speaking in foreign language] - [Professor] Why don't you try the Chinese laundry? [engine rumbling] - I've got it. - Good, let's get to the car, make it quick. - God damn it, here come the fuzz, we've gotta hide. - The boat. - We missed them, it's your fault again. - Well, what do you propose? - Hmm, that's too much, a boat with legs.
