A man who plays a role not to others, but alone, is exposed to obvious psychological dangers. In itself, the practice of deception is not particularly exacting - it's a matter of experience, of professional expertise. It's a facility most of us can acquire. But while a confidence trickster, a play actor or a gambler can return from his performance to the ranks of his admirers, the secret agent enjoys no such relief. For him, deception is first a matter of self-defence. No, I wasn't a spy, and I didn't meet spies. Of course, to a novelist, making fact into fiction is simplicity itself. Interviewers trying to get the truth out of John le Carré need to keep all their wits about them. He's not only the man who turned the spy story into high art - he was actually a spy. And spies, of course, are not meant to tell the truth. Le Carr's classic Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, however, is a critique of a very different kind of liar - a double agent who betrayed us to the Russians. In his isolated house, le Carré carefully guided me through the deceptions which have affected his life from childhood. What Philby and I had in common was immense, immeasurable, terrifying, irrational fathers - men who would tell you anything, lie about themselves, make themselves really unreachable to children. And Philby's father was the most dreadful fellow - a kind of conman who worked the Middle East and became a Rolls-Royce representative, wormed his way into the Saudi Arabian court circles and converted to Islam for reasons of convenience. And I always felt with Philby that he took the path I might have taken if I'd been a different animal. I learned first to be a chameleon. The technique is based on the theory that the interviewer, loving no-one as well as himself, will be attracted by his own image. You therefore assume the exact social, temperamental, political and intellectual colour of your inquisitor. Sometimes this method founders against the idiocy or ill-disposition of the inquisitor. If so, become an armadillo. Place the interviewer in a position so incongruous that you are superior to him. Turn him into an ape, send him naked to Masonic banquets, condemn him, like the serpent, to go about on his belly. When I was five, my mother simply packed up and disappeared and I have no memory of mourning my mother at all. And so my dad was the only parent I knew. He was a man of no political education - no education at all. Tremendous fluency. A wonderful... ...kind of sponge for picking up attitudes and manners and voices and things. And he stood as a Liberal candidate for a Great Yarmouth constituency. We can't put our ideals in the collection box. We can't pay for our sons' education with ideals. You have to realise that he was proposing himself to the people of this constituency as a Baptist - which he wasn't - as a teetotaller - which, my God, he wasn't! And as a man of the people, which he certainly was. And we would stop between meetings, and he had a Bentley, and Mr Nutbeam was the chauffeur. And Mr Nutbeam would whip round, open up the boot of the Bentley, and there was this little dovecote with splits of champagne in it. And... And he would whack one home and then into the next schoolroom in some benighted broad or other. Ladies and gentlemen... He had one speech and the speech went... "So, people of Yarmouth, "I want you to remember this. "People come up to me in the road and they say to me, "'Ronnie, you're a man of ideals - what place have ideals in politics?' "And I say to them..." - very Churchillian - "And I say to them that ideals are like the stars - "we cannot reach them, but we profit by their presence. "And thank you very much, people of Yarmouth." And every damn speech ended with this piece of nonsense. Then we got to Acle Broad out on the Norfolk Broads. He delivered his speech, and... ...a woman got up at the back and said, "Is it true the candidate's been in prison?" And there was a silence. And Ronnie, my father, moved to the front of the little podium, and said, "I see here people of a certain age - "mothers, fathers and grandparents. "And I want to ask them this question." If one of these children - like this son of mine, sitting here behind me, poised to collect some of the highest prizes the law of this country can offer - if one of these children should ever make a mistake... ...and pay the price society exacts... ...and come home and say, "Mum, it's me... "Dad... it's me..." ...which one of you sitting here tonight would slam the door in his face? In the car, as we whizzed off to the next meeting, I said... ... "What's that about?" And he said, "Oh, many years ago I was in the position of an office boy "who took a few bob out of the stamp-money box "and was caught before I had a chance to put it back." Well, I learned later that he was sentenced, I think, to four years in prison. As I became more... more grown-up, he began to use me to go and deliver messages of the most frightful kind. Like, "My father just rang. "He's terribly sorry to say the cheque's in the post," or... ...or... "He can't make it home this evening." And then... before the big crash, we were hiding the cars in the back garden and so on, so that they couldn't be repossessed and probably also so that people didn't know he was there. He was tremendously warm, sentimental. He got you in a great big bear hug and would... "Ah, come on - don't look like that! "Don't be like that." Come on, dry those old peepers of yours. Give your old dad a hug. There was absolutely no way you could relate face to face, truth for truth. Never lie, son. No Pym was ever a liar. See how I told them the truth tonight? God heard me. Always does. Really, the only retaliation was... ...was... ...the secret path. I think I learned to give myself very rarely to people and enormously treasured - as I still do - my secrecy. I invested institutions with those qualities I hoped to find in parents. But I received a savagely orthodox and brutal early education from the private and public school systems of those days and then went to the holiday schools between. So I... invested institutions with very cruel and unpredictable powers. His relations with his housemaster were not good. He was in Westcott House. The housemaster, which was a man called Stanley Thompson, was a rigid, rather narrow man. Kind, but... ...er... ...morally very different from... ...the Cornwell background. Thompson had really a very poor view of Mr Cornwell Senior. Understandably. So... ...really, Sherborne was very much a mixed blessing. The actual gulf between Sherborne - this very high-church orthodoxy as it then was - and the chaos of domestic life and the... the terribly funny, rackety scenes we lived- that gulf became unbridgeable and absurd. And I found myself tending to both extremes, so that I went off and stayed with the Anglican Franciscans in Cerne Abbas for one bit of the holiday because I really wanted to immerse myself in the meanings of Christianity and I wanted to commit to the extremes of the teachings of the school I was in. On the other hand, I then suffered a complete revulsion from the Christianity and the orthodoxy and I began to think that I was the plaything of ridiculous forces - on the one hand, this rackety criminality, on the other, this toffee-nosed high-school stuff. Um... And I fled it, really. Well, the room has changed, as rooms do. I don't remember any books around here. What I remember is a great long table and the professor sitting up at the end and, I suppose, about 20 students or so arranged either side. You have to understand that in the German and, indeed, in the Swiss ethic, the professor has a tremendous authority - far greater than one could imagine in any English teaching institution these days. And he sat here looking tremendously venerable in his silver hair and I was really an escapee from England and... I was a 16-and-a-half-year-old kid. It went right over my head - the complete discussion. He talked about... He kept talking about "die fliegenden Blätter der Art und Kunst". These were the... the terms of reference of the Goethean period. And I couldn't understand how you translate "flying leaves of art and culture". And he must, after a while, have identified me as some kind of stowaway, because he asked me to stay behind at the end of the seminar and so I remained behind. I looked half the age of anybody else there. And, really, if the discussions had been in English, I wouldn't have understood them, but they were in very, very cultural German and about people I'd never heard of and I was sitting there with my thumb in my mouth, practically. And... he said, "What are you doing here?" And I said, "Well... I'm a refugee from England." And he said, "Well... then you'd better stay." Charlemagne said to possess another language is to possess another soul. And I wanted that other soul. I felt that my English one had been sufficiently battered and I would prefer to change it for a different one. And it was here, really, that, in a curious way, I said goodbye - I think forever - to my sense of integration of English life. And I returned and I remain devoted to my own country in lots of ways. But I've always retained that distance from it. I was completely lonely, and although I'd cut off from England I terribly missed the company of English people. I missed, above all, my school friends and that kind of thing. And so I went and attached myself to the English community by going to the little English church up by the embassy. And... ...I was picked up. Well, I was taken into people's homes and... One diplomat - who I expect was attached to the intelligence section - asked me to do jobs so trivial and minuscule that they're really of no account whatever. But I trolleyed off thinking I was the greatest spy in the world and hung around in Geneva and gave a gentleman a parcel and, you know, looked for somebody carrying a copy of last week's Time magazine - whatever it was. And I thought I was absolutely the male version of Mata Hari. And the clandestine nature of it became me - it absolutely fitted with my nature at that time. If we get interrupted by some chance encounter, Magnus - friend of yours, friend of mine, but not in the family, I'm sure you understand me - you and I are embroiled in the affairs of the British Embassy's Anglo-Swiss Christian Society. I'm the new secretary. You're my missioner at the university. Just in case. He was a child agent, graded "semi-conscious" - which is our sweet way of saying he sort of knows what he is sort of doing and sort of why. He was 17 years old and if he needed you urgently he was to ring Felicity and say his uncle was in town. If you needed him you'd phone the Ollingers from a callbox and say you were Mac from Birmingham passing through. "Float, Magnus," you said. "Get in there and be your own charming self, Magnus, "you said. "Keep your ears and eyes open - see what sticks. "But, for God's sake, don't get into trouble with the Swissies." I'd done a run to Geneva or wherever it was, and I came back to Länggassstrasse, number 45, where I lived in a tiny attic - all alone, obviously - and my landlady said, "The Fremdenpolizei want to talk to you." Now, that's the Special Branch - the people who look after undesirable foreigners in this country. So I was absolutely terrified. I thought, "My God, this is it - I'm going to be shot at dawn." And I also noticed that my beloved English Raleigh bicycle that I'd brought with me from England had disappeared. So I went down to the police headquarters to what seemed to be a formless but formidable, deeply threatening interrogation about where did I come from, had I got a student's card? Yes, I had. And finally he said, "And do you know about the law "relating to bicycles in Switzerland?" And I said, "No." And he said, "They should all be registered "and you have been informed against "because your bicycle does not carry an official licence, so get one." Father decided that David must go to Oxford. So, in a Cornwell sort of way, one of his pals was a man called Sir James Barnes, who was a civil servant and interested - as Father Cornwell was - in the fortunes of the Arsenal Football Club. And he said to Sir James Barnes, "I want to get my son into Oxford." Sir James Barnes said, "Well, I know another civil servant - "Folliott Sandford" - later registrar here. Um.. And Folliott Sandford was approached and he said, "Well, try Keith Murray, the Rector of Lincoln." That's in the first instance. And Keith - knowing that I had been at Sherborne and had only recently come here - said to me, "What do you know of David Cornwell?" I said, "I think he's a very nice, intelligent chap." So we brought him up, interviewed him in the next room. He did some sort of exam and passed with colours and, in spite of... a sort of somewhat grumpy letter from his housemaster at Sherborne, was admitted. Well, he was sort of diffident, and he was very English and a bit military and very, very withheld. He kept a very low profile. He didn't in fact engage very much in... ...in... in... conversation. And I think the fact that he contributed to the magazine Oxford Left as an illustrator meant that, in a way, he could hide. I mean, he didn't have to discourse. I mean, all he had to do was to draw, and therefore he didn't, in a sense, have to engage conversationally. I did notice him... hanging around - I think one has to say - a number of meetings, and loosely and rather mysteriously associated with the left in Oxford. There is this bloke who says you were busy spying when you were at Oxford. Yes. Um... Is that true? Yeah, it's true. It's true in the sense that... ...there was a conviction then that... ...the Russians, the Soviets and their allies would be recruiting from the ranks of Oxford, middle-class Oxford undergraduates in the late '40s, in the same way that they had done in the '30s at Cambridge. That was the terror. Father went bankrupt and, really, there was no money to pay David's fees and I think he just got desperate. Had no money, he had debts. Um... he... ...asked me, he said, "Let's get married." We'd been going to get married the following year and I was going to continue working. And by that time I'd been told that he was going to work for MI5. - Told? Somebody came to the house? - Somebody came to the house and we had dinner and he told me, you know, said, how did I feel about it? They'd obviously checked me out and I was OK. They didn't do any further vetting that I was aware of but they warned me all about, you know, how he would be called off on jobs that I wouldn't know about. Did you gradually form an ideological notion of what being a spy might be... - Well... - ...and then sort of join up? Was it just that you were recruited by the army when you did your national service? Well, I was recruited... ...both by the army and by the... ...by the civilian branches of intelligence at different times. I think when the option was presented to me, it was immensely attractive. It really was as if the whole of my life had prepared me for this moment. It was entering the priesthood and it was the call. I really believed at last that I had found a cause I could serve, that I had, by instinct, the methodology to serve it well. And I also longed for the dignity which great secrecy confers upon you. He had various informers, I think. He was running various informers. I'd say trades unionists, but I don't know if it was only that. But the ones I knew about were sort of very often long-term communists who, after '56, got fed up with the whole thing... ...and got worried about the way things were going. That is my assumption. I'm not sure. But I know, you know, there was one rather sweet man you felt terribly sorry for. It felt like betrayal. But it had a voluptuous quality, as it did for my character. A voluptuous quality in the sense that this was a necessary sacrifice of morality. And that is a very important component of what makes people spy - what attracts them. There is something delicious about being told now, "We're going to have to burgle that house tonight." And... "So we must do this. We must do this. "We must get the drawing, we must get the plans. "And what we'll do is we'll have a policeman outside. "And while the owners of the house are away, in case they come back, "the policeman will say, 'I'm sorry, you can't come in. "'We've had a burglary report on your premises.'" And these larcenous instincts, which are put to the service of the Crown, do give a kind of buzz, without doubt. That's the delight of the game. He was obviously brilliant there from the start, and I think 5 thought they'd got quite a catch with him. That's my impression now- I mean, I didn't necessarily think it at the time. Until that time, we thought he could make a bit of extra money for us by his painting. Then he had this long train journey going up and down to London every day from Missenden - well, an hour's train journey. And so he started to write. "Smiley, Marsden speaking. "You interviewed Samuel Arthur Fennan at the Foreign Office on Monday. "Am I right?" "Yes. Yes, I did." "What was the case?" "Anonymous letter alleging party membership at Oxford. "Routine interview authorised by the Director of Security." "Fennan can't have complained," thought Smiley. "He knew I'd clear him. There was nothing irregular - nothing." "Did you go for him at all? Was it hostile, Smiley? Tell me that." I loaded upon Smiley's shoulders the responsibility of having gone to interrogate a man - you - and I'm saying to you now, in a rash moment, "I think, according to our records, you joined the Communist Party while you were at university," and you're saying, "Yes, but that lasted six months "and I realise it was a load of bunkum. "Anyway, I fell in love with this girl and I gave it up." And I'm saying, "Fine, well, it's good that you've got that off your chest." And I go back to London and you shoot yourself. And I'm called to account in the middle of the night. "Did you bully Nigel? "What did you do to him? "I mean, Christ, can you imagine what this is going to do for us?" You know, "We hold you personally responsible for this." So Smiley began in that situation where he almost felt set up and everyone was accusing him of causing a scandal. He says you cast doubts on his loyalty - that his career in the FO is ruined, that he is the victim of paid informants. He said, "What? He must have gone stark mad! "He knows he's cleared. What else does he want?" "Nothing. He's dead. Killed himself at 10:30 this evening. "Left a letter to the Foreign Secretary. "The police rang one of his assistants and got permission to open the letter. "Then they told us there's going to be an inquiry. "Smiley... You're sure, aren't you?" Our second son had just been born at home, and he came back that morning and told me that he'd moved from 5 to 6... ...which he'd done sort of out of the blue, and told me, "Well, that will mean we will go abroad, which will be quite fun." 6 had a certain glamour because it was attached to the Foreign Office and you did travel with it much more and he was in deep cover there. When you say deep cover, you mean sort of...? Well, he wasn't... Some officers are declared to the country if it's a friendly country. - Right. - Some aren't. The central government of the Federal Republic of Germany is situated at Bonn. Berlin is separated from the West by the Soviet Zone and is not, in full, part of the Federal Republic. My stamping ground was Bonn, and the larger sort of West German political scenes as exemplified in meetings in Hamburg or Munich or Frankfurt or wherever, and getting to know German politicians was my stuff. But when the Berlin Wall went up... ...I happened... I'd been in Nuremberg... ...and there'd been a great SPD German Socialist rally addressed by Willy Brandt, and Willy Brandt said, "Wir haben Fingerspitzengefühl" - we feel in the tips of our fingers - that there'll be a crisis in Berlin very soon. And I went back to Bonn. I thought, "Well, I'll just... I'll do a little telegram." Just as a journalist would - "I'll file this one." I had an uneasy feeling. And by the time I got to the embassy, people were running around the corridors and all the lights were on. The news was coming in of the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint going up, and the fun had started. It happened in series, as it were. First it was barbed wire, then it was extended barbed wire, then the ploughed strip came - that was mined. And I was looking for the new book. And I think for 48 hours I didn't sleep at all. When I got back to Königswinter, where we lived, I was in a state of what I think shrinks call fugue. I was tremendously high and in five weeks I wrote a huge, overlong version of what became The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and I cut it down to about 55,000 words and bunged it in. I think I knew then that I'd had one of those moments of... ...what I think of now in retrospect as literary maturity, if you will - a moment when material and subject come together and you feel, "Yeah, this one's really right." And I was pretty sure that I had said something... ...that was important about... the idiocy of the situation, really, and the human cost of it. "Get back!" Leamas hissed. "Get your hand away! "How the hell can I see if you wave your hand around like that?" Slamming the car into first gear, he drove fast across the wide road. Glancing to his left, he was astonished to glimpse the plump silhouette of the Brandenburg Gate 300 yards away, and the sinister grouping of military vehicles at the foot of it. "Where are we going?" he asked suddenly. "We are nearly there. Go slowly now, left. No, no - left, left! "Go left!" he cried. And Leamas jerked the wheel in the nick of time. "Through there," came the whispered command. "Then hard right. You'll see a street lamp on your right. "The one beyond it is broken. "When you reach the second lamp, "switch off the engine and coast until you see a fire hydrant. That's the place." "Why the hell didn't you drive yourself?" "He said you should drive. He said it was safer." "Look." The man pointed down a side street to the left. At the far end, they saw a brief stretch of wall, grey-brown in the weary arclight. Along the top ran a triple strand of barbed wire. "How will the girl get over the wire?" "It is already cut where you climb. "There's a small gap. You have one minute to reach the wall. Goodbye." I knew -just from the papers that had crossed my desk - the imminence of world war. And when the Berlin Wall went up, some of us at least thought that the end of the world was quite close. And so I wrote a book in great heat which said, "A plague on both your houses." I read it in German, of course. And for a long time it was the only book I read. This was, I think, in beginning or middle of the '60s. How did you get hold of it? Because it wasn't published, I suppose, in... in the DDR, was it? Ja... You see, in my position, I was responsible for... ...foreign intelligence work, and so I had the West German magazines and papers, and I'm not sure whether I give an order to bring me this book or one of my spies brought it as a present. I was surprised how he described the contradiction between Mundt and Fiedler because I saw them as a representative of intelligence and counter-intelligence. And the contradictions... ...were close to our reality at that time and I was astonished because... And I would like to ask John le Carré now because I have... Until now I haven't an answer Had he... Had he that time some information about the situation inside of our Ministry of State Security? I think the techniques of interrogations are not too different in the whole world. The police methods, the methods of the secret services... If an interrogator in our ministry has to interrogate an arrested man, he had on his table the files from the operative service with all facts, observation, information of other agents, and so on and so on, about this man and why he was suspected. Usually one interrogator, he had some sympathy for the interrogated person and understand them, understand their motives and so on. And then another one - his way of interrogation is really hard. In GDR, physical methods of interrogation were forbidden. This psychological... torture, if you want, was the most successful and painful method for the arrested people. I don't think it actually was an ideological standoff in many ways. I think the information was available to both sides, but whatever the causes, one system was a great deal more benign than the other one. It took from... When did it get published? It got published about autumn '63. Just at the time Kennedy was assassinated - I remember. Just come out sometime around then. And by January... ...'64... ..people like Life were after him and photographing him in Hamburg. And we were all prancing around in the garden being photographed peering out of bushes and looking like spies! It was all tremendously exciting for him. I was there with three children and being rather dreary. My demands of the service, my expectations were too many and too great. I wanted to enter heroic status immediately. And when it turned out to be - as any large outfit will - it turned out to be a partly incompetent bureaucracy and so on, and the banality of much that it did and the ineffectiveness of much that it did really came home to me, that began to coincide with a period of parturition separations. Things hotted up so quickly. So many people ringing up, so much photography, so much lionising became very difficult for the office to handle, I think, quite easily. You know, they were terrified his cover was going to be blown any moment and the whole thing would go. So he... So they asked him to leave - very politely. What was really working full-time... ...overtime, I suppose they would say, was the literary response to the environment I found myself in. I mean, mine was a worm's-eye view of the whole institution of spying and British intelligence. And I didn't really develop that view until I left the secret world - which happened in my early 30s - and began to use it as my... ...my... metaphor for the human condition, if you will. It is a little difficult to know when to trust you people and when not. You do live by rather different standards, don't you? I mean, you have to - I accept that. I'm not non-judgemental. Our aims are the same, after all, even if our methods are different. I once heard somebody say morality was method. Do you hold with that? I suppose you wouldn't. You would say that morality was vested in the aim, I expect. Difficult to know what one's aims are, that's the trouble. Especially if you're British. I'd not been in the secret world long before George Blake was unmasked as a defector. I'd not arrived in Bonn as a young diplomat for more than a few months before Kim Philby was also exposed. So I observed the impact of this upon the services themselves. It was much deeper than, "Christ, which operations are blown?" It was, "These were gentlemen. These were us." For the first time, it became apparent that Etonians were not necessarily by definition secure. When you think of the duality of Philby's life as a double agent... So there he is setting up the Albanian operation and he's saying, "Right, you boys, we'll take you off and train you. "It's going to be terribly dangerous "but it's for a free Albania, and you know what you stand for." And then sneaking round the back and saying to his people, "They'll be landing on this-and-this night." They landed one by one into reception parties launched by the KGB. And those people died horrible deaths under torture. He was in the front line of the intelligence world. He knew what kind of country he was serving secretly. He knew about the deportations, he knew about the corruption. He knew about the bad stuff. He knew about the planned genocide of the Soviet middle class. And yet he went on working against us. Now, our shortcomings are manifest and we are not a perfect democracy, but, my goodness, we do allow people to protest in public. And Philby therefore carried to the grave, as far as I was concerned, my unqualified contempt. He is a man whom you can give great respect because he did it as a man with conviction very close to my own conviction. And he did it not because of money or under pressure, or because of lovers and so on. He was a man of great intelligence. Philby betrayed David - gave his name to the Russians when he was working as an MI6 agent in Bern, a young man at the university. So Philby gave his name, among other names, of course, to us. Of course, Philby was very English. And it may sound paradoxical, but he reminded me of David. Dignity... ...er, dry humour... ...er, soft when necessary, hard when necessary... ...reserved. It's a vanishing type of an Englishman, but Philby was very much like David. And like Sir Alec Guinness when he played Smiley. It's absolutely typical of Smiley that in a sense he loves an England that doesn't exist. He loves standards of human behaviour which are unfindable. And therefore he is some kind of disappointed romantic who has to accept compromise as a kind of personal pain. "An artist is a bloke who can hold two fundamentally opposing views "and still function." Who dreamed that one up? Scott Fitzgerald. Well, Fitzgerald knew a thing or two. And I'm definitely functioning. As a good socialist, I'm going where the money is. As a good capitalist, I'm sticking with the revolution because if you can't beat it, spy on it. Don't look like that, George! It's the name of the game these days. You scratch my conscience, I'll drive your Jag, right? No. Did you get that from Haydon? Is that one of Bill's jokes about materialist England? The pigs-in-clover society? - Don't you like it? - Not much. Of course there are competitive and acquisitive instincts in Western society, but they are offset against other concerns which you won't find in... Poznan, Budapest, Kiev, Sofia... Tell me all about it, George. I'm just saying that's England now, man. All you have to do is look out the bloody window. I tried to write Tinker, Tailor without Smiley to begin with. And I had a pictorial opening, which I always have, just as I have the final frame of the book, if you like, in my mind, and know nothing of what is going to lie between the two. But what I couldn't do was get into the past without the authority of Smiley's own memory. And once I brought him back, er, I realised that, in fact, he was a man with unfinished business. The restless retirement. When he sees Peter Guillam coming to him at the beginning, I think he knows what Guillam's come about, really. Just as when he goes to Connie, Connie knows what he's come about. He loved the service, the spirit of the service. The sense of self-sacrifice and dedication and comradeship which, without doubt, that world imparts. Smiley was my secret-sharer through a whole lot of early books when I was very scared of emotion. Emotion was filtered through Smiley. For as long as he was there, he, in a sense, stood between you and the feelings you might have. He was a comforter. Vivian Green was the strong moral intellect in my life. And you might say the good side, the strong conscience of Smiley is from Vivian. David himself, as it were, revealed this in a newspaper article in 1980, was it? He used the words, "My mentor at Sherborne, who later moved to Oxford." I said, "What do you mean by this?" He said, "I've always been secretly amused "that you never saw that you had some of the qualities of Smiley." "An understanding of human nature, "a sympathy for human frailty... "...and a capacity for listening." But really, the rumpledness, the sense of not belonging, the sense of being a misfit, the sense of being personally ugly - these derive so much from the humiliations of childhood. Even at prep school, my dad didn't pay the fees and you began to feel that in the way you were segregated and spoken to and, "Have you heard from your father? Do you know where he is?" and so on. And when Lord Iliffe wanted beaters to come and raise the pheasants for him to shoot, I was one of the boys who was never chosen because it wasn't seen to be right in some way - I wasn't quite a gentleman. I took all those things very personally because I expected so much of the institution. I wanted it to replace parenthood, and I wanted it to embrace me. And the rejection that I suffered somehow went into the misfit that is Smiley, er, the outsider that is Smiley, er, the very... ...the skilful observer that is Smiley. And any child who actually believes that home is a terribly dangerous place becomes, in self-defence, a very acute watcher and listener. George Smiley is a real hero and a man of great intelligence who did his work with full conviction. I think, of course, it's the result of le Carr's inside knowledge, these, er, partly real methods of interrogation, of intelligence work. And so I can recognise them. Markus Wolf says you portray the GDR as the evil empire. Does that square with your creation of Karla, Smiley's opposite number in Moscow Centre? Karla is drawn, really, from those '30s Comintern figures where the spirit of self-sacrifice on behalf of the revolution is absolute. Bakatin, who was head of the KGB, said to me, "What you must understand is that this was the popular revolution. "This would free the world. "And we accepted as the bitter pill that we had to swallow "the mistakes, the acts of inhumanity along the way." And I think it was that kind of actually very admirable commitment to the communist cause that I wanted to dignify in Karla. What Smiley knows is that in luring Karla away to the West, he, Smiley, has deployed the methods of the East. And what Karla knows is that in giving way to his human compassion... ...he has broken with his own ethic. George, all your life, fantastic! Take care, George. Go well, hear me. So both of them feel, in a sense, that they've betrayed the code they lived by. And Smiley feels unclean at having blackmailed Karla... ...having discovered that Karla had a mentally defective daughter whom he's accommodated in Switzerland. Come on, old friend, it's bedtime. George! You won. Did I? Yes... Yes, I suppose I did. I waited, at the end of the Cold War, for something to tell us the world can now be reshaped. That endless standoff, as it seemed to us, between the two great economic monoliths of the Western world and the communist world was over. The excuses for exploiting the Third World, for imposing dreadful little dictatorships on them provided they were anti-communist, all those excuses had gone. Now something decent could be put together. A real act of global perestroika could occur. Nothing happened. We went into a kind of collective Western atrophy of isolation and self-indulgence. Our response was to make ourselves fatter and richer and not to take on the world at large. Er, and so I felt that a great moment in history had simply gone by default. Still we're involved in the ethnic wars. See Yugoslavia, you see Chechnya here in Russia. And what change? Of course Russia is now democratic and a member of some European society, but still espionage is on. Military competition is on. The CIA has more money than it had before. What...? Who are they spying on, by the way? On Poland? I take it that in the end being a spy is such a rotten thing to be that you have to find ways of feeling good about it, and some of those ways may be quite genuine. I think he must have felt in the past, at least with part of him, that he was defending an order which was defensible. The interesting change is manifested, I think, in this new novel of his, because here he has as his central figure Justin, who does belong to an older order, the old imperialist order, whose values I imagine David might once have upheld and thought that he was defending in the best way he could, who moves quite radically in the course of the novel to a much more open position. In fact, I would say a radical position. We meet him really as a kind of unawakened conformist who's contracted a rather romantic marriage with a very young girl who is outspoken, a young lawyer, Oxbridge, rich, er, and she's very zealous and idealistic. When they get to Africa, she peels off and gets into aid work, where she's happy. Very happy. She gets pregnant, loses her baby, and that in a sense intensifies her sense of human responsibility. And she throws herself into the aid work and comes upon very alarming secrets about the pharmaceutical world. Then we have Justin, after her death, picking up the trail and putting on her mantle. And it becomes, I suppose, a novel of education, as the Germans would say, a Bildungsroman, where he learns humanity on the hoof. Active, contributing humanity, constructive humanity, and an intense sense of responsibility towards the wretched of the Earth, who were Tessa's concern. Drugs have got to be tried on somebody, haven't they? I mean, who do you choose, for Christ's sake? Harvard Business School? I mean, Jesus. Foreign Office isn't in the business of passing judgement on the safety of non-indigenous drugs, is it? It's supposed to be greasing the wheels of British industry, not going round telling everybody that a British company in Africa is poisoning its customers. You said something very interesting when we started doing these interviews - that you'd forgotten how to lie. Yes, that's how I feel now. I have, I simply have. I mean, I grew up with two big lies. Er, three, really. Er, the one that I've always denied to myself, which was simply the disappearance of my mother and the lies that were told to us about her. Then, for the tiny time I spent in the secret world, for years after writing The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and leaving the service, I went on denying it. Then the final big lie was while my father was alive, I just couldn't talk about him. My sister Charlotte rang from London to say that he'd dropped dead. It was a Sunday evening and he'd just had a massive heart attack. And... ...I... I simply noted it. I had no feeling of anything at all. It was as if that part of me had been removed. And I guess from then on, it's been appraisal rather than mourning. And fits of tremendous admiration for the juggling act, however many times it failed. I mean, I've stood alone on a New York street... ...trying to imagine, "What's it like to be in this city, "on the run, without a penny in your pocket?" And all you've got to do is make sure you've got a clean shirt and a pressed suit. And that was really all the equipment he had. And somehow or another, he survived. They did this to me, but I've remained who I am. I'm tempered, I'm able. Inside myself, there's an untouched man. If they came back now and did everything to me again, they would never reach the untouched man. I've passed the exam I've been shirking all my life. I'm a graduate of pain.
