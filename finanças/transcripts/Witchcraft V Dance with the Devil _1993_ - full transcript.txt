[music playing] [music playing] [yelling] Relax. You look nervous. Why don't you take this off? $50, right? Um, do-- do I pay you now? You act like you've never done this before. Well, I've done this before. Do what you've always done. Let me tell you a little secret. I like doing really nasty things with men I don't know, and you look like the kinky type. You have got really great tits. I bet what you got is real nice, too. You can give me the money now, sugar. Shall I call you that? Uh, sure. Sure. You can call me anything you want. Now, don't watch. I'm shy. You like this, huh? You want to play with these? Eh-- I just gotta tell you, I don't meet many girls like you on the road. Well, I don't meet too many guys like you either. So, better take that off. Why don't you? [yelp] Ugh. What the fuck took you so long? I got him, didn't I? Any longer, I would have to screw him. Just give me a break. Looks like you won't be able to speak to the homeless today. You'll be late for the Western Ecumenical Conference. They can wait if I'm a bit late. The homeless can't. Besides, if the other ministers spent a little more time with the poor and a little less time with the rich, they'd understand. You're the only one who seems to care. Heh. You really are a man of God. No. The only difference between me and the others is that I've been blessed with the means to aid those who need it. Life is very short here, and I've chosen to dedicate my life to helping others. MARTA: What's wrong? BILL: He's dead. MARTA: What are you talking about? BILL: He's fucking dead. Well, what the fuck did you hit him so hard for? Jesus Christ, I killed him! Mm. I'm fucked. Let's dump this body and get the hell out of town. Come on. Where are we going to dump him? The canyon. The canyon. Stuff his body in the car. Let's do what we can. Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on, idiot. I'm giving your money back. Jesus Christ. Shit! Come on! Fuck, this guy's a monster. Idiot. Christ! Even when times seem difficult, God will not turn his back on you. You're all his children. Remember the words of the scripture that say, "the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want." Come on. "Please, don't be in want for the temporal wealth of the world. Rather, yearn for God's permanent treasure house in the heart." That's what really counts. What the hell did you hit him so hard for? Please, leave me the fuck alone. I can't believe this shit. MARTA: Last time I deal with you. BILL: Fucking guy's dead. He's dead all right. Yeah. He's fucking dead and I fucking killed him. Oh, shit! MARTA: Look out! [screaming] Who is this fucking wino? Christ. Fuck! I can't believe you did-- I can't believe you did that. Shit! Call the police. Is there anything I can do? Flesh. Give me your flesh. Your flesh. Give me your flesh. [grunting] Are you sure that you're all right? When I saw you grab him by the throat, I thought-- I'm fine, I'm fine. Just give me a moment to compose myself. Happen to have a cigarette? A cigarette? Since when did you start smoking? No. You're right, you're right. What am I saying? I haven't smoked in years. I guess old habits take a long time to drop, especially in moments of stress. Mmm. What was next on the agenda? Council meeting. You know what? I think we are under a bit of a strain. You do look a little peculiar. Better go freshen up before the meeting. Douglas, let's turn around and take the Reverend home, please. Well, you really had a good night. What do you mean by that? Well first, you killed that jerk in the hotel. Then you went over some bum. Get off my back, will you please? It could've happened to anybody. We're in a good car. Good American car we're in. Yeah, right. What's happening? What are you stopping for? Oh, shit. It's not me. Shit. Oh God. This is brilliant, you know. Absolutely brilliant. All right, all right. It really makes me feel good knowing I'm with a guy who knows everything. [grunt] What the fuck you hitting me for? All right. Get out and fix it. I don't know how to fix the fucking car. I don't know how to fix cars! You know nothing? Nothing! Are we out of gas? We're not out of gas. It's full. I don't know why it's stopping. It's not even hot. Shut up, would you? Just shut up. What the fuck are we going to do? We got this guy in the back here. Shut up. Shit. MARTA: All right, all right. We'll just leave the body here, all right? Yeah. And then somehow, we're going to find our way out of this hell hole, OK. That's it? MARTA: That's it. Fuck it. Let's get the hell out of here. What a fucking mess. [music playing] I can't believe this. Believe what? You are such an idiot. Well, what do you want from me? Oh, could you be a little slower? Come on. Man, I can't believe you. No matter what I do for you, you're never satisfied. Christ. Marta. Damn. You know, it's a long way back. Great. We wouldn't be here if you hadn't screwed up. What's this? What the fuck is that? Shut up, Bill. Let me do the talking. Hi. Mind if we sit here? Not at all. Coffee? Thank you. So, what delayed you? Delayed us? Oh, you were waiting for us? For a while. Your time of waiting has passed. The moment of accounting draws near. Are you a preacher or something? You know, there's a price to pay for transgressions. We ain't done nothing. Really? Your souls say otherwise. Oh, this guy's fucked. We should get the hell out of here-- Shut up. He's our ride, OK. You know, I bet it gets kind of lonely out here for a preacher. HOODED MAN: I'm not a preacher. I'm a collector. Oh, like, uh-- like baseball cards or something, huh? No. Debts. Debts, huh? So you're a bill collector. I bet you find a lot of deadbeats out in these hard times. I have to get some more coffee. I'll be back in a minute. This is perfect. What's perfect? This fucking guy ain't driving us anywhere. He's a psycho. MARTA: Forget about the ride. I'm talking about the money. Don't you hear him? He's a bill collector. BILL: So? He's probably got it all stashed in there. Well, maybe. MARTA: Listen, this is the plan, all right? I'm going to get him going and you go back there and you grab something, all right. You come back here and you hit him. And do me a favor this time. Don't hit him so hard. So mister, got any friends? HOODED MAN: Few friends, many followers. Ah, listen, I'm going to, uh, I'm going to play with Mother Nature in a little bit, you know. I'm gonna, you know, take a leak, you know. You know, you ought to smile more. You're a pretty good looking guy. You know, for a few bucks, I can make you feel real good. Hah! Fucking freak. You're getting good at this. Come on, let's see what we've got. There's your transgression. This guy's a fucking nut case. Christ. He's better off dead. I think I did the country a favor this time. Screw that. Just grab what you can. Yeah, I'm looking. MARTA: Find that money. BILL: Look at this shit. Pfft. Hey, Marta. MARTA: What is it? Doors have secrets, huh. Yeah. What do you think? Whoa, shit. Look at that fucking sword. Oh, God. This thing must be worth thousands. Only thousands? What the fuck are you doing here? [screaming] Stop. Kill him. Marta. -What are you doing? -Kill him-- -What are you doing? - --now! Stop! What are you doing? [grunt] MARTA: I can't stop! Enough! And My blade. You live only because it abuses me. I have only to wish it and your soul will join that of your friend over there. Do you understand? Good. Now, you are going to help me. This my holy cause. I have served Satan well. And now, at last, my moment of rebirth draws near. What shall I do? You will do anything that I command. You will speak only when spoken to. And if I command you to die, you will do it. And if you serve me well, you may be chosen to serve Satan. Now that we have an understanding, let us begin. Will. PREACHER (ON TV): --be able to help us. As you know, there's-- [inaudible]. What? Hey, sleepy. Come on, get up. It's after 8 o'clock. PREACHER (ON TV): "Thine money perish with me." There's no time for that. PREACHER (ON TV): "Don't hold onto that--" Wait, what time did you say it was? It's after 8 o'clock. Damn. PREACHER (ON TV): You can't take it to heaven-- I thought the alarm just went off. Damn it. You must know children that ministering to the poor-- Do we have to be in line at 8:00 AM? PREACHER (ON TV): Makes a great-- Better get used to him. He's my minister. PREACHER (ON TV): Much more money than you've been sending me. Now, look into your souls. You-- This guy sounds as sleazy as all the others. I've never seen him like this before. WILL: I've got a court hearing at 9:00. My client's going to have fit if I'm late. Empty your wallets and your pocket books. I'll see you at lunch. Mm-hmm. Oh, wait. Um, I won't be here for lunch. I have an 11 o'clock flight to San Francisco today. I thought you were off today. I'm-- I'm filling in for Sue. I'll be back this afternoon. Right. Oh, hey. And, um, don't forget tonight. WILL: Tonight? What about tonight? Dancing. The Rock Palace, remember? You promised. Not the Rock Palace. I hate that place. You know that. All those freaks. PREACHER (ON TV): --good Christians. Fine. All right. All right. I said I'll go, so I'll go. Don't worry. I'll see you tonight. Bye. Good luck in court. Can I help you, mister, uh-- Cain. You may call me Cain. Cain. Where's Mr. Hills? He died four years ago. I'm the new manager. Very well. How soon can you be ready for my performance? BARTENDER: I don't want to sound rude, but you don't look much like a rocker to me Mr. Cain. How perceptive. I do magic, hypnosis. Well, I'm sorry. This is a dance club. We don't do hypnosis here. How great. But I must do my show here. Everything must be ready for my coming. Maybe you didn't hear me pal, but I'm kind of busy. So why don't you take a hike, OK? You dare to interfere? It is the sixth day of the sixth month of the sixth year since I last appeared. No one can break the cycle. Show tonight, and every night I desire. These things and henceforth obey me in all ways. From this moment on, you are mine! [club music playing] Have a drink? No, not yet. Thanks. Hey, is this your regular crowd? No. They came for this magician. Guess he's got a bit of a following. When's the dancing start? We might not have dancing tonight. They said the magic show might run a little late. Oh, I haven't seen a magic show since I was a little girl. Oh, come on. There's no such thing as magic. It's all illusion and you should know better. William, I've got some advice for you tonight. Oh. And what's that? Stop being such a lawyer. CROWD: (CHANTING) Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, Cain, (FADING) Cain. Cain, Cain. Welcome. I bring you greetings from our master, Lord Satan. Any volunteers? Me. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Me. -Me. -Me. Me. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Me. Me. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Me. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Me. Cain. Cain. Is there a problem? No, not at all. I thought you looked familiar, but I can see I was mistaken. Won't you come up and join the others? I could use your assistance in a trick or two. No. I don't-- Come on. Go up. You go up. I'm not into this sort of thing. This is crazy. Don't be such a big baby. He picked you. Now, go on. Yes. Please, do come up. [applause] You seem uncomfortable. I sense a strong power here. It's always nice to run into a warlock. You never know when one could come in handy. [laughter] I believe this man is a duck. [quacking] No, wait. A chicken. [clucking] Stop. This little demonstration of my power over you, warlock, was amusing. But next time, no one will laugh. Now, return to your seat, but remain in my power. You will appear to be normal for now. We will talk later. [applause] That was amazing. Did you know what you were doing? I didn't do anything. I just stood there. Told you he wouldn't hypnotize me. CAIN: And the gates of the underworld-- Well, what are you talking about? He had you making a complete fool out of yourself. [applause] He might've hypnotized you. I didn't do anything. Bless you, my children, for yours is the ultimate sacrifice. All of you shall help me reach my destiny and revolution of our master Lord Satan. (WHISPERING) You are blessed in his eyes and most beloved in mine. Soon, soon he will come in glory, liberate the Earth, and open the gates of Hell. [screaming] Why? This isn't what you told us. Ha! You had six years of earthly pleasure. Now you must serve Satan in Hell for eternity. What a waste of my time searching for these creatures. I must build my quota. There are always a few sniveling cowards who think they can hide from me, but they must know that no one can escape my reach. I'll find them and bring them to you if you show me how. You have no power, mortal. Ah, but I know who does. The warlock, William, he has great power. He can do my bidding. Yes, bring me this William. You need only use lust, one of the seven deadly sins, to control him. He will follow you. [laughter] Be with Satan. Give it to me. Give it to me. CAIN (VOICEOVER): Love Satan. [roar] [growling] Christ. How do you do it? You've got 10 of these clubs, and they're all making money. Did you sell your soul to the devil? Shut the fuck up. Why don't you go do your job, whatever the fuck that is? Look, we're going to open soon, right? Right. You're a manager, right? Right. Go fucking manage. Jesus. You're the real thing, aren't you, a white witch? I can feel your power. Yours is the power to hold another soul. You will do much for us. There is much to do. I have to collect hundreds of souls before I am reborn, and if I succeed, Satan will break through the fire and chains of Hell and return, triumphant! And you will help me in this, my noble cause. [rock music playing] Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Look, you don't get it, do you dork? No, these kids don't drink beer. They take ecstasy. Ecsta-- now look, I don't know how the fuck you spell it. It doesn't matter. Look, why don't you just crawl back in your hole, huh man? I ain't got time for this shit. Can I do something for you? Yo, mummy man, what the fuck do you want? What do you think I want? I don't know. Money? Membership in my club? How about a clue? Now look, Jack, you either talk to me or get the fuck out of my club. You pathetic son of a bitch. All your fancy cars and women and music. Don't forget my good looks. You think you're invincible? Well, I've got 10 very successful clubs. Nobody can touch me. You've lost your touch. Who are you, hm? A goddamn critic? No, a messenger. A friend of mine has a message for you. He says you've got something he wants. No shit. I've got something everybody wants. Who's your friend? WILL: His name's Cain. That's a nice name. Says he wants your soul. Uh, wait a minute, man. My time's not up. Um, I know, I know, I know. Tell your friend that you can't find me. Could you do that for me, huh? I-- I mean-- could you do that for me? Could you, you fucker? CAIN (VOICEOVER): Kill him. It's not my time yet, man. Come on, it's not. This isn't fair. Come on, come on, come on, man. Come on. Hey, this isn't the deal I cut. This isn't the deal I fucking cut, man. [grunting] [roar] [groaning] [roaring] [growl] [hissing] Well done, William. Now leave me. The warlock is very impressive. [screaming] [shouting] Satan! Will. What is it? Come on, honey. It's just a nightmare. Just a nightmare. Hey, honey, you're hurt! I can't understand this. There's nothing. There's not even a cut. I can't remember. Will! What is it? Come here. I feel faint. This blood, I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense. What did you do last night? I didn't do anything. I was asleep. I mean, I didn't even dream. OK. Try to remember, were you up at all last night? Were you sleepwalking? Look, I don't remember. Honey, I'm worried about you. Don't touch me, you fucking bitch. What the hell's gotten into you? [screaming] No. I already called the doctor. I don't think it's anything medical either. Uh-huh. That's right. Well, I mean, it was like he had supernatural strength or something. Uh-huh. And-- and all that talk about Satan. No, he didn't mention any other names. Oh. Why? Well, will you see him? OK. I'll-- I'll be here. OK, well, no. If you think she can help, please bring her. OK. Thank you. He's perfectly healthy. His signs are negative now. You can bring him in for some testing, but I'm not sure what that'll show. OK. There's nothing further I can do, I'm afraid. Thank you. Uh, Keli, how are you doing? I'm OK. I'd keep him away from his law office for a couple of days and he should be fine. Now, if there's any changes in his behavior, or if there's anything else that you want to notify me about, you just let me know, all right. [music playing] I'm scared, Will. It's OK. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. You've never hit me before. I know, and it will never happen again. I promise. I don't know what happened. I must have snapped. It's about us, right? It's about me moving into your parents' house. You don't want me living here. That's not it and you know it. It's nothing to do with that. Keli, I love you very much. No. It is me. How about counseling? Would you be willing to talk to my minister? I mean, I know he can help. I'm OK. I don't need any help. Will, please, would you just do this for me? I'm OK. Keli, everything is going to be OK. I promise. I promise. [doorbell ringing] Will, this is my preacher, the Reverend Meredith and his friend Astasia. Keli told me about what happened. You promised to see him. It's all right. It's all right. This is my assistant Astasia. She's a channel or a vessel for higher powers. She can sense the presence of evil or negative forces. Now what's that got to do with me? That's what we're going to try to find out. This is supposed to be counseling, not vudu [non-english speech] There's an evil in the city, something that has returned, hunting, hunting from the past. And it may be, it may be attracted to you. You're crazy. Please. She's trying to help. She knows what she's doing. Turn around. Oh, this is ridiculous. Come on. Oh my gosh. Meredith, you've got to do something. This is bad. He's under the spell. I knew it. It's the sixth year. Could you help me with this? Yeah. I think he'll be much safer in the bedroom. Is this really necessary? [inaudible] What does all of this gonna do? It will repulse evil. We must create a wholesome environment. He is under the spell, but if we keep him protected, it might gain some time, and hopefully figure out how to break this. Are you scared? Don't be silly. You can take care of this. I have other business to attend to. But you must help, Meredith. No, no. Take care of it. Bye. Reverend! [speaking german] OK. Now what? He'll sleep for a while. I have to look in my books for an anti-spell. Do you think you can break this? I don't know. There's some powerful magical at work here. If I only knew where it came from. Magic. Of course. I completely forgot. What is it? Will and I went to this club last night, and there was this guy there who hypnotized him. Ugh, it was creepy. He's got to have something to do with this. I-- I can't believe I forgot about it. Do you remember what he was wearing, what he looked like? Oh, no. I don't. All I really remember were his eyes. They were weird. And he kept repeating some line, something about-- something about the circle filling up and the gates opening. Do you remember what the magician called himself? I don't. Oh, Keli, it is very important that you remember this. Please try to remember. Do it for Will. Cain. His name was Cain. What, you know him? Yes. I've heard of him. If it's the same person I'm thinking of, we're in big trouble. KELI: Who is he? You don't want to know, Keli. He's very old and very evil, very evil. What could he possibly want with Will? I don't know, but we must stay awake tonight, and I must find a strong spell, something that'll work. Well, can this Cain get-- get to Will through this protection that we've made? Do not forget, Keli, we're dealing with the occult and anything can happen. But if you think something supernatural is involved and if you think he's at risk of being attacked by evil, why didn't you stay with him? Because if the power behind this evil is who I think it is, I'm at risk. Astasia, she can stay behind in Stanton. She can report back to me if she wants. I don't understand what has happened to you. Ever since that attack the other day, you're different. You never would have run before. I'm that different? All this preoccupation with the occult, suddenly working with witches like this. Astasia. And now it's like you're hiding from someone. Well, maybe I'm preparing to fight with an old enemy. Hello, warlock. Sit up. There's a man, a rock musician, who owes our lord. Sold his soul to be successful, and he is long overdue. Claim his soul and bring it to us. Satan let this man go for a while because he thought his music touched so many believers. Now, it's grown old and out of date. Tonight, [inaudible]. You know, a warlock is like a double-edged sword. Either edge could kill. You never talked like this before. I've changed. I never imagined it would come to this. Yeah. Oh. [moaning] You fucked me once. It's time for me to do my bidding for Satan. Stop! In the name of Abraham, don't dance with the Devil. [inaudible] [screaming] [grunting] I'm not done with you yet. [growling] [roar] [drums] DRUMMER: Man, we need a break. You're not getting one. DRUMMER: Well, fuck you, Derek. Yeah, man. Nobody wants to listen to your stupid Satan bullshit anymore. Great. This is just fucking great. Hope God pisses down your fucking throats. Now what? Speak up, pal. Can't you see I'm rehearsing? Who let you in hear anyway? Your music used to be pretty good. You're Derek. That's me. What do you want, a fucking autograph? It's all over, Derek. You're finished. A friend of mine sent me here to collect a little debt from you. Who? Someone who helped you. Someone who made your success possible. I did it, pal, all by myself. Now, you can just get out of here because I've got some real problems. Yes, you do. You see, you owe your soul to my friend. [glass breaking] What is this, you fuck? [groan] Have you brought a gift? Yes. Another traitor, I suspect. I grow weary of this. But I see who it is. Oh, yes. What a pathetic freak. [hissing] Well done, William. We are now in the second stage and that much closer to opening the gates of hell. You will have a place with me in my next life. Good morning. How you feelnig? I feel better. Where's Astasia? I don't know. She was gone when I woke up. Do you think maybe I can get out of this circle long enough to take a shower? I'll even take one of these candles with me. Yeah. I don't thinking it would hurt. You know, all this stuff about Astasia, it's really getting me down. I'm really glad I have you. Well, I think it's working, so stick with it, OK? Oh, there's why we don't have any water pressure in the shower right there. Do you need any tools or anything, honey? Wait. Here, I'll help you. Woo! Shit. [laughter] Don't! [panting] No. [screaming] Stop it! [screaming] [sobbing] Why us? I mean, why the hell does this have to happen to us? I'm sorry, Keli. I just lost control. Don't even think about leaving the circle again. Where's Astasia? She'd know what's going on. Look, I'm sure she'll be right back. It probably takes time to find the right materials for this sort of thing. Well, I'm going to go look for her. No, please. Don't leave me. Look, I'm afraid. I mean, there's things that I need to know. There's nothing to talk about. Yes there is something to talk about. We're supposed to be getting married. I love you. Just talk to me. It's nothing. You're hiding something. Jesus. I'm being torn apart. I can't explain it. I mean, I feel like I'm losing control. I'm going to go look for Astasia. And I'm going to stay in the circle and try to get my strength back. MEREDITH: He attack you? Yeah. It's like he's out of control or something. Or under someone else's control. What are you talking about? I don't understand where Astasia could have gone. Astasia. Astasia's dead. Oh my God. Are you saying-- (ECHO) I killed her. I killed her myself. That is not him. I know. Who are you? Who are you, old one? You're a strange evil. I must tell my master about you. Who is your master? Cain! What is it? [laughter] Reverend Meredith! Reverend! Keli? KELI: Will? Keli. What was that? That voice-- I don't know. I'm in trouble. I can't even leave my house. I'm a prisoner trapped in my own house. Get Reverend Meredith. -OK. He has the answers. I've encountered a strange, evil presence. Who is he? An ancient, evil spirit whose soul goes by the name of Softra. Hides in the body of a priest. What? And you know where to find him? Yes, master. He's very special. A fallen angel of the church, he was once with God, and I have wanted his soul for over two centuries. You will have William bring him back to me. [inaudible]? No. Softra must not be killed. See to it that the warlock understands this. Why protect Softra? Softra is worth hundreds of souls. If we find him, all our preparations will be complete and the reign of Satan will be near. What about me? The faithful are never foresaken. What should I do? When the last soul is mine, Satan will return to Earth. Then, I will tell him how loyal you have been. Thank you, master. Praise the lord. You know, I never knew that you could be like this. All those years working for you, I fantasized about you, about your great strength and position. I never dreamed that we would get together like this. I'm not who you think I am. I've, uh, done a lot of bad things in my life. I've been like a man on the run from the truth. You're talking like a man condemned to die. I know. I don't know if I'm going to be escaping this time. [laughter] Reverend Meredith. [clears throat] Keli. I think you ought to leave. Keli, what are you doing here? What is she doing here? If I told you I was ashamed of myself, would that help? I've changed, Keli. In some ways for the better, in others for the worse. After tonight, it's not going to matter anyway. What do you mean? I mean we can't stop him. None of us has a chance. We're all finished. Are you talking about Cain? Yes. We're old friends. I've done a lot of bad things for him. I have to leave. Where? Anywhere but here. And if I was you, I'd run too. Run? No. I just can't let him have Will. He's killed Astasia. You can't fight him. No. It's true. You can't win against him. I know. He's far too powerful now. Well, we'll all fight him. I'll win. I'm not going to lose Will. Cain is the greatest source of evil. We can't fight him. Reverend Meredith, you used to talk about the-- the power of prayer and faith. Remember that? So let's pray together. Come on. This old soul hasn't prayed in over 200 years. Are you ready for Satan? I will do anything for him. Hear me. I wish to thank you, the young followers of our lord Satan. Hail Satan! He must reach out to you young. New generation must believe that there is no god and no one can love them like Satan. I'll reward them with power and riches, as he has done. My reward is coming soon. Hail Satan! You are the true soldiers of Satan. Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! All right, listen. If you get close to him, he has a weakness, only one. There's a sword. Yeah, I saw him wearing it. Kill him with it, and it ends. But he knows about his weakness. That's why he keeps it close to him, so no enemy will use it against him. Well, but if I can reach it-- But damn it, you still have to have the power to wield it, and that's not an easy thing. We're all-- we're all finished. Well, there's got to be another way. His death is the only way to free William-- and the world. [yell] (CHANTING) Hail Satan. Hail Satan. Hail Satan. Hail Satan.
