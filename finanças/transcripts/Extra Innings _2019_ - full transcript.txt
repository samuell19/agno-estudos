Rita it's a shame Abe couldn't make it for dinner, I made so much food. His parents are always calling him for something. He should be here later. His kids are so cute. Just like Rita, you are so beautiful. Thank you daddy. Hey ma' the food was delicious. Nothing was burned tonight. Thank you, David. David, did you tell them? You did, right? Come on. Tell them. Tell us what? What are you talking about? You know, C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A. What are you talking about Vivian? Don't be acting crazy. Dave is going to play college baseball in California. What do you think about that? Come on, David. Don't we set a scary cat. What are you talking about Vivian? A baseball coach from California saw me play and asked me to go to school there. I could play ball all year round. This could be my chance. Chance for what? To be a baseball player, ma'. I don't know if you know this, but it's all I ever think about. Well I know you like to play, but- Have you ever seen David play baseball? What ma'? I don't like to play. I love to play. I can't think of anything else I'd rather do. Did you ever watch Morris play baseball? Why are you bringing up Morris right now? Because we never talk about him anymore. Yes, yes. We saw David play, didn't we, Eli? No. You never saw him play. Since I've been home, I've watched you him three times. He's amazing. Say something Eli. Say something. Look, you could play right here, right? It's not the same thing ma'. The school is right by my house. He could stay with me until he settled, it'll be fun. With you? Shut up, Rita. David, you need to stay home. You have your family here. You have your friends here. This is your community. It's not like I'll be gone forever. You're Jewish, David. You need to keep Shabbat. You need to get married, and have a family. Baseball is not for you. What do you mean not for me? I know I'm Jewish. You don't have to tell me that. Just because I don't follow all the rules doesn't make me a terrible person. That's ridiculous. I love Shabbat, but getting married and having a family, okay, but I'm not there yet. What about Hank Greenberg, Sandy Koufax? If you know what's best for him, you should just let him go. That's not what's best for him. How do you know? I know. Come down, Eli. What's best for me? You want me to come home and find another man to marry? As if that's going to make me happy. What's wrong with that? You don't have a job. You need to get settled. You need to come home. You have nothing there. What do you mean I have nothing there? You want me to come home and live here? Are you kidding? No, No. We'll help you. I'm seeing someone and we're in love. I just need this money to start this business. You cannot be serious about this guy, Danny. Yes, we're serious. Is he Jewish? Not exactly. Not exactly. What does that mean? It means no, not Jewish, but I'm with the nicest, most gentle person I have ever met. Here, here, here. Here's a picture of Danny. Who's this? Oh my God. I'm gonna go give the kids a bath. I'll come and help you. You're a good kisser David I am? Yes, no one ever told you that before? Yeah, sure. God, you're so cute. Come here, sit. Close your eyes. No peeking. No peeking. You like classical music? Yeah, you don't. I can change it. No, it's fine. I'm just surprised. Why, I don't seem like the type? It helps me relax. I can change them if you want. No, it's cool. Are you okay? Yeah. Does the music bother you? No, it's okay. You're arms are so beautiful. What's wrong? What's wrong. Are you not attracted to me? No, you're beautiful. I'm just thinking. About what? Wait, David, do you want to talk? What's wrong. I don't- - David. Hey, hey, talk to me. What's going on? I had a brother. He was much older than me, and he killed himself. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. He was mentally ill. All he ever did was read classical literature, and listened to opera and classical music. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Are you sure? Sometimes I feel guilty like I shouldn't enjoy life. Like I should suffer or something. Maybe I could have helped out more. Sometimes I blame my parents. I know that nobody's to blame. David, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you ever tell me? I never talk about it with anyone. I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's okay David. David, David, David. Hey, hey, okay, okay, okay, look. You can't control everything. You deserve to be happy. It was not your fault. Look, let's just hang out tonight. no pressure. I'm sorry. It's okay. Hey, mom. Hey, dad. David. What's going on? We need to talk. Please sit. Okay, what are we gonna talk about? Your dad's upset. What's wrong with dad? He's ulcer is acting up. He's very angry with you. Dad, what's wrong? We don't want you to go to California. There are plenty of colleges right here. I know there are plenty of colleges here, but I have an opportunity, and I want to take advantage of it. I want to see if I can make something of this. This is something that I love. You'll grow out of it. What? Be practical. Go into business. Enough fooling around, David, enough. Hey, honey, calm down or you'll make yourself sick. You think I'm just fooling around? You think this is just something fun that I do? You have no idea how I feel when I play baseball. Maybe it's how you feel when you make a big sale or business is good, or something like that. I don't know. You probably never felt like this. I work fucking hard at it. You don't talk like that here. You're not with your baseball friends now. What the... What does that mean? You just, you don't get it. I don't get it. You just want to do whatever you want to do. Just give up everything that we ever gave you. Family, religion. I work so hard, so hard to raise a family, to send you to the best schools, just to throw it all away? Calm down, Eli, please. Sit. Sit, please. David, we want you to be happy. You have your home here. You have your family. Your friends are here and you can still play baseball here, right here. Right, Eli? It isn't the same thing. I need to get away. What does that mean? Away from us? I need some freedom to be on my own, to have a new taste of life, to meet new people. Vivian said that you have a girlfriend that's not Jewish. What are you trying to do to me? Are you trying to kill me? You must not get involved with anyone outside of our religion. Do you understand that? I will disown you if you do. Eli, I'm sure she was just joking, please. What are you talking about? David, please. Your father and I- - I can't believe this. You want to give up your religion? I want you to meet with rabbi Stein. I told him that you're going to call him. What are you talking about? This is nuts. You want me to support you just going around in California? That's not what you went to Yeshiva for. You left home when you were younger than me and your religious. What good is it anyway? I'm not talking to rabbi , forget about- - Enough David, enough. I'm sorry, but you really don't know me. I'm going to bed. David, you will change your mind. You'll see. You've never seen me play baseball. Not even once, not even one time. My mind is made up. You're quiet today. What's going on? You're thinking about the other night, or? Nothing's going on. Hey, stop lying to me. Natalie, I decided to go to California and go to school, and play ball. Oh my God, that's great. Congratulations. What's wrong? Your parents don't want you to go, or? Would you come with me? What? Would you, think about coming with me to California. Okay. David, I really like being with you, but my whole life is here. I can't just go out there and start over. Why not? You have a job here that you hate. Your dad's not around much. Vinny is off in school. Hey, come with me. I'll get a part time job. I'll go to school, play ball, and you can get a job there too. It'll be amazing. And then what? Then we have babies together? What- - Wait, well, who said anything about babies? I mean, maybe we could. I don't- - Okay, David, no, I can't. I can't. Look, I think you're really sweet, and I also think that you need to go do this, or you're always gonna wonder what it could've been like. I don't want to hold you back. You're not going to hold me back. We can have it all. No, David, I can't. Well, what do you mean? I need to go. What? I can't get too serious right now with you or with anyone? I'm sorry. We're together, right? Maybe we shouldn't be. What are you saying? Nothing, look, nothing. I'm sorry. Look I have to go, but let's just be cool about this. We can talk about it later. It's not- - I love- But all in that same moment. She understood everything. Crime and punishment, Fyodor Dostoevsky, page 549. Sabah, go run some sprints. Okay guys, take some fly balls. Sabah, you're hitting next. Come on David. That's all right, that's all right. Come on David, let's go. Nice and easy David. I know you can hit. Relax, this is just a practice. All right David. Come on David. Way to go David. That's my brother. That's my paper. Wow, yeah. That's my brother. That's my brother. He can hit. Good job, David. Now, get in the outfield and do some more sprints. This looks divine, babe. You're a great cook Vivian, thanks. Thank you. The veggies are from my little garden in the back. I love it here. Don't you love it here, David? Yeah. You're making any friends, David? A couple. It's kind of hard so far. I'm supposed to hang out with some of the guys later tonight. How's the baseball? A lot of really great players. I hope I can just get a starting position. Don't be silly. You can't be negative David. Vivian, this tastes so, so good. You taste so, so good. I am so blessed to be joined by two of my most favorite people in the whole world. I love you both more than you'll ever know. We love you too. Thank you, Vivian. Sit, sit. This feels good. I have to look for a new job tomorrow. I thought you had a new job. I did, but I quit today. Why? Because my boss is woman. She's a real cunt. At first I liked her. I thought she liked me. She even hit on me once. Maybe that's it. Don't worry about it. Hey, I talked to the dorm people, and they said, it'll be ready to move in next week. No, you can stay here as long as you want. I love having you here. Thank you. Morris used to listen to this. I took some of his records. It helps me remember him. I miss him. What the fuck. What the fuck is going on? What is wrong with you? Are you out of your mind? God. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Sabah, coach tells me you're starting today. Really? Yeah, you're playing center and batting first. Let's go. Okay, David here we go. Strike. Good job. Good job. Yes, great. Hi. So, how was your day? It was good. I'm thinking of going on a diet. Why, you don't need to lose weight. I think Danny thinks I'm fat. What? That sounds... I don't think you're fat at all. Thanks, David. How was your day? Actually, my best day yet. I had three hits. Almost hit it out of the park. Started and played center. That's great, and sweet. Danny and I are going to the movies. You want to come? No, thanks. I'm just going to relax here and watch some TV. Like I said earlier, the dorm is going to be ready for me next week. Okay, listen about last night. I'm sorry. I was out of control, it was the. Can we just not talk about it? Please, let's just forget it. Why did you ring. I always leave the door open when I know you're coming. I just felt like ringing today. What's with my suitcase? That's right, we talked about you staying over for the weekend. But I thought you had that yoga seminar or something on Sunday. No, I'm not going. So that's great. Come on. If we want to make the movie. We have to run. Can you come with me upstairs when I get ready. David's just going to chill here. No, Vivian, I don't feel like a movie tonight. So cool. I can make some fresh fish and then we can drink some wine and cuddle and then beautiful sex and- - I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. These are some of your things that you left in my place. Is this a joke? What are you talking about? It this about my brother? No, no, not at all. He's cool. And you're sweet and thoughtful. I met a guy while you were in New York. We've been hanging out a little bit and I like him. I like being with a guy again. It just feels more normal to me. So I'm not normal? What the fuck are you talking about? I didn't say that. Why don't we... We can hang out all together and see how that feels. I mean, just the other day you said you loved me. I know. It's over now. Listen, I got to go. My friend is waiting. What's his name? Douglas. Yeah, he's really cool. I got to go. Go, you fucking cunt. Go suck, Mr. Dougie's big fucking prick, you fucking asshole. Get the fuck out my house. Vivian, Vivian, Vivian. Vivian. Vivian, are you okay? Wake up. Wake up. Come on, let's go at the beach. The sun is coming up. What time is it? Time to get up and go. Come on, come on. Throw on anything. Let's go quick. I made some breakfast, and you have some hot coffee. You're sure you're leaving now? Absolutely. Come on. It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah, it is. You know he used to love the ocean. Who? Morris. When he was a little boy he used to tell me how he wanted to die in the ocean someday. Roll around the water and just let the sea feel his heart. Really? I'm going to go climb that cliff. I'll come with you. I wanna be alone. Sure? Knock them out of the park for me? Vivian. Vivian, no. Dear David, please take care of yourself. I love you. Tell mom and dad and Rita, I love them. Love Vivian. Hello. Natalie, hi. David. Hi. I'm running out the door right now. Can you just call me back later? I can't call you back later. Can you just give me a minute? I've been trying to reach you. Yeah, I've been busy, David. I'm working overtime on these crazy hours and my boss is out of town, so I'm handling his shit. It's not like going out to California and- - I'm here in Brooklyn. Vivian died. She killed herself. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. David, I really am. Can I see you while I'm here? Yeah. Yes, yes, of course. I really have to go right now, but call me later. I miss you. I miss you too. Are you okay? Yeah. It's so good to see you. You look good. Thanks. What's that? Sneak out the back.
