I always wanted to have a house by the water. Nothing fancy. You know, the smell of the sea. A boat. A fireplace. Cook outs, barbecues. Hot-dogs and marshmallows. A family. A family together. Don't we all have such a dream? I did. We gotta get dressed, Mom. It starts at 12. Okay, honey. Grove McCarthy was my boss, my business partner and my best friend. Without him, I would have been nothing. He picked me up when I had fallen. He supported me and he believed in me. And together we started and we built a business. Then, in its success, changed our lives. And the lives of all those who worked for us. And now he's gone. Lost at sea. And it's made a terrible time for all of us. But most especially, Ellen, Katie and Josh. The only consolation when there is no consolation is that he was doing the thing he loved, sailing. Grove in his boats. And especially this last one, - The Samara. -[THUNDER RUMBLING] You could drown, Grove. I'm gonna drown in this rain. The safest place to be is on the boat. Whatever I could think to say, I don't think I could say it any better than Oliver Wendell Holmes. The great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving, to reach the port of heaven, we must sail. Sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it. But we must sail. And not drift, nor lie at anchor. I...don't know what I'll do without him. Mrs. McCarthy. Very moving service I thought. Go on, sweetie. Go with Aunt Rachel. Isn't it unusual for a policeman to talk... Just paying my respects. Oh, I thought maybe you'd found out something. Not yet. But we will. - You sound so sure. - I am. Why? It's been months and you haven't. Grove is still gone. I want to send forensics to your house. - You already did that. - Yeah, but that was just a preliminary sweep. I'll give you a call. All right. It's good you had the service, Ellen. Yes, it was. I still can't believe that he's dead. We all needed the closure. Coffee? Beans are in the freezer and the grinder is in the cabinet. I need a drink. Stiff drink. - Ellen. - What? A drink? [SIGHS] So tempting but... No. I'm going to go check on Katie and Josh. [PLAYING VIDEO GAME] Josh. Josh. Are you okay, honey? Daddy's not gone, sweetie. He'll always be here. He'll always be right here. In your heart. This is an adventure. - I am the leader. -[TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Let's hear you say, "Call me Ishmael." Call me Ishmael. - I like that. -[LAUGHING] Stand at attention. Okay... I am the captain. All right. You ready? One, two, three. Look. - Voila. - Oh. - It's beautiful. - Wow. Is that really for us? How's that, sweetheart? Look, Josh. She's perfect. - It's great, isn't it? - Yes. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHTER] Now, that is always been the side I've been on. It's an aggressive position. We're in the business of aggressive positions. I'm not going to worry about that. It's too late for that. My turn now. [KISSING] Isn't that my sweater? Prove it. Prove it? [CARESSING] Katie and I were alone when I first met Grove. We'd lost her father, my first husband and... we were just falling apart. She was all I had. And she was my life. And then, along he came. This wildly charismatic, successful man. What are you doing? Well, I'm stalking a very beautiful woman. [LAUGHS] Two, I'm going to kiss that beautiful woman. [GIGGLES] Three, I'm going to kiss her thoroughly. And four, I'm going to ask her to marry me. What? What, what? I'd like to hear number four again, please. I bet you'd like to hear that on my knees. Now we had Josh. And the world was... Bright. - Katie. - Look at it. Look at the water. It's so dirty. It's okay, honey. Don't worry. It'll clear up. It's so dirty. It's just the rust in the pipes. I washed the tub. I've cleaned it before. Can we go and sell the house? It's so full of him. I know. Everything will be back to normal. You'll see. You'll go back to school. We'll order bad fast food. We'll argue, we'll fight. You promise? Do you know what species on this stupid planet has got the greatest powers for recovery? What? Who? - Women. -[LAUGHS] I love you. You're really something. You know that? And as soon as everything is settled, we'll go. I promise. Been worrying about you since the tragedy. I'm not just your lawyer, I'm your friend and the news isn't good. What news, Leo? What do you mean? I'm afraid there's some debt. Larry Denton here and myself, have been fending off creditors. - They may approach you. - It's true, they might. What are you saying, Leo? [STAMMERING] What's happening? A few months ago, Grove started selling off his investments and drawing money out of the bank. No, that's impossible. There is still his life insurance. Well, at least there is some face value left. - It has a small amount. - But... - What? - Unfortunately, you can't claim life insurance until the will's settled. It's the same with the house. Its community property, but it's in Grove's name. So, until the death certificate is signed, you can't sell it. But what if he's never found? I... What if there is no body? I'll look into it. But normally you have to wait seven years. What about your assets? What assets? I gave Grove everything to invest. Oh. Mm-hmm. I'm going to have this one plot of worthless land. But, from your first marriage. No, no. Cancer took Katie's father. The hospital bills took everything else. I'm going to have bills to pay. So, could I sell his new car at least? - Well not until... - Not until the will is settled. Nothing could stop you from driving it though. Hi, Jim Javison with Disco Satellite, -I happen to be in the neighbor... -[BEEP] Hi, Ellen. It's me. We're thinking of you. -Call you tomorrow. -[BEEP] Ellen, Leo. Things keep cropping up. Bills, bouncing checks. I can't figure it out. Please call me when you can. You listening. Are you? He deserved to die. Detective Kazin. Got a couple of questions. Glad to come see you or you can come see me. Appreciate it. Thanks. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [SIREN WAILING] - Oh, Mrs. Carthy. - Detective. Glad you could come. We're still searching. We got the Coast Guard helping us out now. They are dragging the shoals area. Why there? Oh, for hundreds of years, boats have gone down there. Even back in the Civil War, some iron-clad gunboat went down. -[PHONE RINGS] - I don't know. I don't get it. Can't swim. Not my thing. And the weather was bad the day your husband disappeared? Yes, it was raining. What about this boat that was found floating two days later? - You mean the Dinghy? - Yeah. Dinghy. Um, any reason why that would happen? No. I have no idea. Have you ever heard of the... - Marlberry Foundation. - Marlberry. No. Here's the file. Apparently there was a check made payable to the Marlberry Foundation. - From a company... - What company? Gates Spur Unlimited. Gates Spur. No. Never heard of it. Not surprising since there's no such company in the United States. We're checking Switzerland and the Caymans, but they got a nasty tendency not to give us much. This can't have anything to do with Grove. Well, that's not quite true. It seems as though he... organized the event, handled the account, wrote the check and the money's gone. Oh, how much was the check for? One million dollars. Looks like there's a lot more going on than we first thought, doesn't it? [MUSIC PLAYING] - I'm glad you came. - Ken. One moment. Excuse me. Ken. I need to talk to you. I just came from the police station. Why didn't you tell me the mess we're all in? All right. Come in. Grove was broke. He took money from the charity. [MUSIC PLAYING LOUDER] It seems you must have known all this, Ken. Grove was my best friend. He would have wanted me to be there for you and... - And I am. - What does that mean? What that means, Ellen, is that there was trouble. All kinds of trouble. And I didn't know how to tell you about it without it seeming like I'm stabbing your husband, who's also my best friend in the back. What about Gates Spur? Did you not know anything about the Gates Spur Operation either? Let me confess to you about Gates Spur. I had heard about it. But I wanted nothing to do with it. Is that possible? And apparently, there's lots of things Grove didn't tell me. Had I ever known my husband? Should I have left him? No one ever leaves when they should. And now he's gone. Funny. How much easier it is to say gone than... [CHURCH BELL RINGING] -[CHILDREN SHOUTING] - It will be good to be back in school. You'll see. I'll pick you up on Friday. All right. - You want me to go in with you? - No, I'm fine. You want to talk, you just call me, okay? And I'll come and pick my girl up. Stop it, mom. I'm not a girl. That's true. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Okay. - Bye. - Katie. -[BELL RINGS] - Hi, Sarah. Here comes the pitch. It's a brilliant fastball, and Jason... No, Josh. He swings and he hits and it's going, going, gone. No, no, no... - Let me show you. - Josh, come here right now, honey. Right now. This instant. - You know better than to get near strangers. - I know. This is private property. I don't know who you are, but please leave or I'll call the police. Look, I don't want to get off on the wrong foot. - Go inside, sweetheart. - I'm a lawyer. I just need five minutes of your time. I'm going in and I'm going to start dialing. I'm not your enemy. Your husband came to see me. - Mr... - Sam. - Sam Penny. - Mr. Penny. I have people coming at me from all directions I have no idea who to trust. Certainly not a lawyer who shows up unsolicited in my garden with my son. Who exactly are you? 15 years ago, your husband came to the University of Texas to be honored. I was awarded a scholarship in his name. I wrote him a thanks. He wrote me back. I went to law school, passed the bar and started to prac... [SIGHS] Several months ago, your husband came to see me. He said he thought he was in trouble. - What kind of trouble? - I thought it was ridiculous. The man was running one of the fastest growing companies in America. And he's worried about the state of the Samara Corporation. He asked me to quietly investigate. And what did you find out? I never had a chance to tell him. Tell him what? Earnings have been overstated by hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you understand? The company is a wreck. Very likely bankrupt. Hey, who's that? Look, I didn't wanna say anything while your sister-in-law was here yesterday, but... The cops came when you were away. What do you mean? - What they want? - What do you think they wanted? A man disappears at sea and a couple of days later his wife and kids do practically the same thing. I had to take the kids away. I called you. Five days later. Ellen, I'm your sister. I'm on your side. So, what did the police say? They kept asking me about what time you left that night, and I told them I didn't remember. - Why did you say that? - Oh, it was obvious something was wrong. - The phone rings, you're gone. - Well, I... I... No... No... Stop. Please don't explain. Don't make up a lie. Don't tell me the truth. I don't know what that phone call was, and I don't want to know. And of course, what phone call? I didn't tell them about any phone call. I don't know about any phone call. [BEEP] [DIAL TONE] I lost my job because of that bastard. Love boats lost at sea. Who do you think you're kidding? [ENGINE STARTING] [SHOUTS] Whoa. Stole from the company and blamed it on me. It's not over. I am watching you. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [CONTINUES RINGING] Hello. Hello... Hello... [BELL RINGS] [CHILDREN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] What do you think? Shall I sell this car and start driving the silver one? Huh? Think I can handle all those buttons? Why? Why, I thought it might be fun. We could use a little fun. You like it better, don't you? I don't care. Actually, I hate that car. - Coming with us? - Yeah, I'll be right up. - Too late. - Go talk to Hannah. [CHILDREN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] - Just for tonight, okay? - Oh, honey. Come home anytime you want. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. We knew the first couple of days back we're going to be tough. Like, everybody was so nice. You know they are too nice. Even the people I can't stand. Just awful. Can we just go now, please? - How is she? - Alright. She'll go back tomorrow. It's more Josh I'm worried about. - Well, what do you mean? - I don't know exactly. He seems distant. It's like he wants to get away from me. - What are you burning? - Oh, damn. Oh, no. [LAUGHS] -[COUGHS] - Oh, it's ruined. Okay, solution. Crispy critter goes bye, bye. We pick up a phone. Dial a pizza. They deliver. Children are happy. Uh, mollified. [PHONE RINGING] That might be nobody. That's been happening a lot. [CONTINUES RINGING] Hello. This is Rachel, her sister. Yeah, she's all right, I think. Do you want to speak to her? She's right here. No. Josh! Oh, hold on. It's for Josh. - Who is it? - Sam Penny. Give me that. What are you doing calling my son? I'm not calling him. Returning his call. Let's cut a deal. Deal? What kind of deal? You got a teenage daughter, a grief-stricken son a world collapsing around you and I can help. Oh, really. How exactly is that? I won't ask you any more questions. I'll leave you alone. I'll take Josh out fishing. I know my way around water, grew up on boats. And you just happen to be in this place. Yes. No. Which is it? I came here after your husband disappeared. - Why? - I rented a room because I thought maybe I could find out what happened. He's a mentor to me. Godfather to me. What was I ever able to give back to him but some advice on boats? Well, it was nice to see Josh excited. But either of my kids going off somewhere with someone I don't know... Especially now? No. All right. So, here are the rules. You want to fish, you can do it off my dock within my sight. You can always join us. No. I was never much of a fisherman. I bet you look great in waders. No thanks. I'll just persevere. Okay. You ready, you ready, you ready? All right. Once you sever the head... -[GRUNTS] -[GIGGLES] You can skin it or not. If you do, it just takes patience and touch. Pretty soon... it comes easy. - I caught the biggest one. - I know. - And I think you already told her. - But I didn't. Okay, so how about I take this... Hands off. This is man's work. - Shall I get the others? - That... is a good idea. It's good to see him happy. Maybe some of it will rub off on his mother. [LAUGHS] It may take more than a fish. Go ahead. Name it then. Are you flirting? What a delicate word. What a delicate non-answer. Well, I thought I wasn't gonna ask any more questions. Actually, I asked the question. Mrs. McCarthy accuses Mr. Penny with a knife. In the kitchen, standing over the fish. You aren't married. - Why aren't you married? - Was. What happened? I needed to grow up. And now? And now, I'm... I'm standing right here with you. Yes, you are. Yes, I am. [SIGHS] But now... I looked at the charts. Well... Here... Something doesn't make sense. What doesn't make sense? With the tide and the bad weather, it would have made sense to leave and wait until early morning. Grove was stubborn. He'd like the challenge. Yeah, and it's... It's hard to wrestle lines and halyards... not to mention the wheel by yourself. And if you don't have a healthy respect for the sea... you're stupid. Grove wasn't stupid. What are you suggesting? He could've stayed at the moorings. Waited for the tide and better weather. If he'd sailed right away, he would have run aground because of low tide at the shoals. He would have been found. I think there's something else. Something missing, not just Grove. Some piece of information. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PHONE BEEPS] You were in on it and I'm going to prove it. I won't be the scapegoat. Justice will be served. You're going to get what you deserve to. [MESSAGE BEEP ENDS] [PHONE RINGS] [RINGING CONTINUES] Hello. Hello. [LIGHT FLICKERING] [HEAVY BREATHING PERSISTS] -[DOOR CLOSES] - Look what I found. Come on in. I was just pouring a glass of wine. - What's this? - Try reading it. There's your signature. So, what the hell is Gates Spur? Just what is this company you have nothing to do with do? Nothing. A nothing company set up to do nothing? What kind of double talk is that? It was just a vehicle to move money around. That's all. - As in laundering? - Calm down, Ellen. It's perfectly legitimate. That's why you and Grove kept it hidden. Grove. Not me. I was out of it after the first few months. A few months now, is it? Months, weeks, days, whichever. That was it. I flunked math. I've never been able to balance my check book. But you know what? If it tastes like it, smells like it, looks like it, even I know what it is. What happened to the money? I have no idea. A million dollars plus and you have no idea? I was only trying to help him. You were my husband's best friend. Turns out I didn't know him. I'm not sure I know you either. You have an Audi? Yeah, Grove and I bought them together. Same model, same day. Only I never use mine. [THUNDER RUMBLING] You've never driven it? Oh, once or twice. It looks so clean. I had it washed a while ago. Been out in the wind and the rain. [THUNDER RUMBLING] You've got to tell me the truth now. Let me make a recommendation, Ellen. In fact, an executive decision. You burn the proof of what you deny. I'm telling you, Ellen, I'm only trying to help you. How do you figure that? Who are you? I am the same man I have always been. I'm ambitious. I take what I can get. Grove is no different. Maybe I'm better at it. You look like you could use a drink. If you could offer a drink to an alcoholic, I don't doubt you could do anything. Oh, God. Katie, Katie. Please, please. Oh, no, no. Oh! Thank God. [SIGHING] Oh! - You saw nothing? - Just a shape. - Anyone else in the house? - My children. - They were asleep. They're okay. - So this is it? Three slots, two shotguns. - One's missing, right? - Oh, I don't know. [PHONE RINGING] - Hello. - The police were here. - They subpoenaed me. - What? And they subpoenaed my phone records. Rachel, there was a break in. I can't talk now, the police are here. - Mrs. McCarthy. - I have to call you back. Sorry it took me so long to get here. Break in? Uh, there's a shotgun missing, sir. - No sign of forced entry. The children are still asleep. - What did you see? I saw a shape. It knocked me down. I really couldn't see more than that. - Could this be related to your husband's disappearance? - How? Mrs. McCarthy isn't sure the gun wasn't missing before, sir. - You don't know whether it was stolen tonight or before? - No. Baffling. You think your husband might've taken the shotgun on the boat with him? - I don't remember seeing it. - He wouldn't normally take a gun on board, would he? He sometimes shot duck from the Samara. I didn't like it. You didn't like what exactly? Shooting and guns. But the boat was Grove's. What was your husband's state of mind that day? Fine. Well, there were some financial problems. There were some, you know, business reversals, but I didn't know about them then. - He tended to keep things to himself. - Ah. Bottled up, hmm? I suppose so. Often the way. How were you two? - What do you mean? - Getting along. The marriage. Fine. Detective. Excuse me. [OFFICERS WHISPERING] Your husband's boat. Coast Guard thinks they found it. One five, diver one five. What's your location, please? Cooper on one-oh-five. We're just passing the outer buoy now. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Get him. - All right, sir. - You got it? [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Sure you wanna do this? Not likely to be pretty. Detective, what right now is pretty? - Is that your husband? - Yes. A fishing boat got its net snagged. That's how we found her. - I'm very sorry about this. - Funny thing. - All the hatches were closed. - What does that mean? I don't know. It's the last thing you'd think of if she was sinkin'. Detective, let's get Mrs. McCarthy outta here. Let the coroner do his work. Let's go. Mrs. McCarthy. I just heard. Are you all right? Get in. Stop. Before we go to the house, there's something I have to tell you. Stop the car. I lied to the police. - I knew that Grove had taken the shotgun with him. - What do you mean? - What about the break-in? - I don't know. I don't understand that at all. Doesn't make sense because I knew the gun was gone. Why didn't you tell the cops? Grove had been drinking. So tell me again. How come you're not coming? In this weather, with that amount of alcohol? How come you don't drink anymore? We used to drink. - We used to have fun. - We used to do lot of things. Yes, what has happened with that now? Where you been? I'm here. I am right here. I don't see anything anymore. Where are you going with the gun? - I don't see you anymore. - Maybe if you didn't have this. Ha, ha. Are you suggesting that I'm drunk? - I am just saying that this is... - You should have a drink. Don't you ever call me a drunk again. But you can call me Ishmael. Bon voyage. I was worried all day because I knew the gun was missing. I made up an excuse and came home from Rachel's early. Katie was at school. Josh was at a friend's and the house was empty. I took a bath and tried to relax. I was going to bed when I heard a shot from the bay. I tried his cell. I went to the dock. The rain was over. I got in the dinghy and went out to the boat at the mooring. Grove? Grove was dead. I couldn't breathe. I thought I was gonna be sick. I knew I should've called the police. But I couldn't. I thought about Katie and Josh finding out. I couldn't let that happen. I waited until it was close to first light and set off. I knew the harbor was tricky. But I'd watched Grove do it often enough. It was daylight before I could believe it. I still wasn't through the shoals. I knew the tide had to be just right to cross them. I'd helped Grove with the maintenance. If I could sever the waste pipes and open the seacocks, I could scuttle her and she would sink. [WATER SPLASHING] I closed the hatch to keep the body from floating away. I set the automatic pilot so the Samara would keep sailing out to sea past the shoals. I made it to shore and set the dinghy loose. I made it. I had done it. The Samara would sink. And by the time the dinghy ran out of fuel, it'd be miles off shore. [SIGHS] So you think he killed himself. You sure? I was afraid the children would find out. - That's why I took them away. - Maybe he took the gun for sport or protection. - From what? - Just thinking of alternatives. The way you describe it. What if he didn't kill himself? What if somebody else shot him? - Who? - Aren't there a number of candidates? - You, Ken Bradley, whoever broke into your house. - No, no. That was his state of mind. I saw it. You saw it. He came to you thinking there was a way out. But there wasn't. I'm sorry I lied. - Do the police know? Did you tell them? - No. - What good would that do? - You must tell Kasim. Tell him I lied about the gun? And tell him I was on board? If I thought it would help, I would have. I would now. I'll do whatever I have to to protect my children. [SIGHS] I've been trying so hard to help. And all along that's what you've been afraid of. My questions. - And this awful truth coming out. - Oh, Sam. I had to tell someone. You believe me, don't you? You do, don't you? Elbow up here, across the chest. Pitcher's there. He's throwin' a really hard fastball at you. Ball's comin' in. Whoo. Hit it. There! - I'm sorry to have to keep asking you questions. - That's all right. But you know the, uh, missing shotgun was found with the body. Preliminary exam says your husband may have turned it on himself though. Why? For what reason? You say there were money problems? - Yes. - Uh-huh. Anything else? He was depressed. He'd started drinking. Was he drinking the day he left? Not exactly. - It isn't safe. You could drown, Grove. - What? - You could drown. - I'm gonna drown in this rain. The safest place to be is in the boat. See ya. Was he capable of, uh, sinking the boat and shooting himself? I mean, a pretty tall order. Yes. Well, we'll know more when they pull up the boat. Gotta get permission. Uh, budget approval. Conservation, Commissioner. I don't know why they bother. Finally, they're gonna have to say yes. - My family wouldn't mind if it stayed down there. - We can't do that. Not to a possible crime scene. - Crime scene? - Whatever happened, all the hatches shut? Even if it is suicide. I always envied people livin' on the water. Yes, we're very lucky. Katie. Katie. Hey, you're not ready. - I'm not going. - What do you mean you're not going? - What's the matter? - Nothing, I'm not going. I don't feel well. Now, come on. Dad's never home. You've never home. It's our chance to be together. Just try and go easy on the old man, will ya? He's having his share of problems. Now come on. - This'll be good for us and it'll be fun. - I hate that word. - What word? - F-U-N. Fun. [MUSIC PLAYING] What was that all about? Clearly, I've lost my instruction manual on this one. I told her she was playin' her music too loud. Really, how can you say that? - Is that it? - What's happening? I don't know what's happening. I mean, I knew our marriage was in trouble. It... Wait a minute. What are you doing? I gotta get rid of it. I am not gonna go down this road again. You know, there are other methods, like give 'em to me. Now I just didn't see it coming. I was so blind. The phone call that night. It was Grove, wasn't it? Did he threaten to kill himself? Is that why you took off? You know, I thought I saw all the signs. And he was fooling around. But I was... I was really angry and ashamed. I know. But he wasn't. What do you mean you know? - What do you mean wasn't? - I saw him one night. But it was Ken. I was wrong. No, you weren't. He was charming, seductive, smart. It was catnip. And I'm not sure he could stop himself. He let women know. He let me know. There's more. A week before he disappeared, I came in here. And, well, Little Miss Fix It couldn't resist straightening up and... This book was sticking out. So, um, I took it out and I looked in it. And I... I... I didn't know what to do. So I did nothing. But I put it back. - Oh, Grove. - I'm so sorry, Ellen. May be I should have destroyed them. Maybe I should have told you. I almost did. I don't know, maybe I shouldn't tell you now. It doesn't matter anymore. You know who it is? We're gonna put the other two there. I marked off the space over here. Left corner. Put it back? [PEOPLE CHATTER] Caroline Manchester? Ellen McCarthy... I wondered if you'd come. And I wondered what I'd say and what you'd do... Well, you didn't set off the metal detectors, so maybe you're not armed. Someone has been calling me and breathing and hanging up. Someone broke into my house. Maybe looking for these special portraits. You think it was me. - Do you think I killed him? - I didn't say that. Well, I don't make breathy phone calls. - And I hope these are being destroyed. - Apparently not. I didn't even know Grove was married at first. - I was enlisted to help on this charity fund drive. - The Marberry Foundation. He was so driven and charismatic and yet vulnerable. I knew he was unhappy. He was troubled. It didn't last long. Married, the photos. So risky. Not for me. - What about the missing money? - Is that how you found out about us? - Ken told you? - Ken? - He introduced me to Grove. - Ken knew that you and Grove were having an affair? He lent us his house. He had the house booked. Cameras everywhere. And Grove found out that Ken was cooking Samara's earnings. Inflating them. Paying off the accountants. And it sent Grove way over to the dark side. Sleeping with me. So he could stop thinking about it and yet believing he could fix it. Take from foundation, cover it up. Pay Peter and repay Paul. And I was only the pawn. [SOBBING] [HEAVILY RAINING] - Can I ask you a question? - Name it. What do you want from me? Whatever you have to give. I don't think there's much left. You're wrong. Now let's go crazy, get drunk. Drive all night. Except I can't drink anymore, I got two kids I gotta look out for. So what do you suggest, Mr. Penney? I suggest you come in out of the rain. I suggest that that was better than drinking or driving. I shouldn't have come. I better go. I suggest that's not going to happen. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] Where's the birthday boy? Uh, there he is. Katie, Katie, come here, please. I wanna show you something. - What? - Josh, put that on the table. Come on. - Put that on the table. - Okay. Come on. Katie, I wanna show you this. You're gonna like it. - Give it to John! - No. - Just put it on. Come on. Rachel, grab the camera. - I got it. - All right, here we go. - You guys set? All right. - Say cheese. - You ready? On three. One, two, three. - Cheese. Come on, Josh. Everyone. Cake time. - Light the candles. Blow them out. - Watch out. Cake comin' in. - Wow. - Oh! Look at that. Ah, cool. - Let me get a picture. - Blow all these candles out. I'll get it, honey. Here. I want a big piece. What're you doing here? Sorry, I had no choice. - Well, you can just come back later. - I can't do that. I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of your husband, Jeffrey Grove McCarthy. You come to my house on my son's birthday? - I'm not going to let you ruin it. - Jinks, handcuffs. You're just gonna have to wait till he can celebrate it or you're gonna need a lot more than those handcuffs. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... Three, two, one. Whoa. - Good job. - Great job. Okay. So, uh, you cut the cake, honey. All right. But you be very careful with the knife. Mom, what's happening? I'll be home soon. Don't worry. It'll be all right. Can we go now, please? It'll be okay. Yeah. Used to be bottom of the sound, underwater, bloat and rotten and the end of evidence. Science and technology keep forging ahead. Though I wanted to apologize about the birthday party. These things sometime happen. - You're a sly, manipulative son of a bitch, aren't ya? - Thank you. Appears now that your husband's wound could not have been self-inflicted. - You may need that alibi you don't seem to have. - Why should I need an alibi when I haven't done anything wrong. Oh, did I mention there may be blood remaining in the cabin? Chew marks on the deck. And if DNA samples survive on your husband's skin or under his nails, on the china and the glasses, we'll be ready to take a sample of yours. Do you know a Caroline Manchester? No. Yes. - I met her. - Know anything about these? So you've never seen 'em before? - I think I'd remember it if I had. - I don't know. You don't seem to remember a lot, do you? [DOOR OPENS] Here you go. We have here a record of your husband's cell phone calls. Calls made to your home at 11:43 that night. Ring any bells? Where were you? 11:40, I was in the bath. Excuse me? - I was taking a bath. - Do you remember taking a bath? - Yes, I remember taking a bath. - Are you sure? I like baths. And so you wouldn't have been able to hear the phone? - No. - Was the answering machine on? - Obviously not. - You'd remember that? I think I'd have remembered it if my husband left me a message. Yes. Would you remember what time you turned the answering machine back on? I don't remember. - Uh, and there was no call from the boat? - No. - Anybody else in the house could've taken the call? - No one. - Not your son? - No. No. The call from your husband's cell was answered. It's here in black and white. - One minute and forty-three seconds. - How do you explain that? I am not lying. I didn't receive any calls. - No. Because you were on the boat, weren't you? - No. - You were makin' the calls. Who were you calling? - It wasn't me. Okay. Let's go back to that morning, the morning that your husband left. I told you. I got up. I reported him missing. And then I waited for three days for you to take it seriously. Okay. How about earlier? - Dawn. No. Before dawn. What were you doin' then? - I was asleep. I know it's difficult, but, uh, try to recall. - I was in bed asleep. - And, of course, you're sure of that. Yes. [DOOR OPENING] Well, seems we have an eyewitness. Before dawn on the morning of August eighth, I was at the shoals and saw a boat. The rain had stopped. A woman was wearing a blue slicker. Could that have been you, Mrs. McCarthy? Were you on board the Samara that morning? I don't wanna say anymore. You knew about the affair, you knew about the gun, you knew about the money, you were wearing the blue slicker and you were on the Samara that morning. Were you not? - He was already dead. - Yeah. After you killed him. No. He killed himself. - That's what it looked like. - What made you go on the boat? [SIGHS] I heard the noise, the gun. You told us before you didn't hear a sound. I lied. - What about the phone call? -[SIGHS] I... I pressed the send button on the cell. It must've gone through to the house and I dropped the phone. It must've gone - through to the answering machine. - Which you then erased. -[SOBBING] Yes! - So another lie. I just, I couldn't bear my children knowing what... I just couldn't bear my children knowing what kind of man their father was and that he killed himself. - What else did you lie about? - No. You tell us the truth about anything? Why did you kill your husband? - No! - Why did you kill him? [SOBBING] Set up a line-up, then we'll book her. -[DOOR OPENING] -[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Oh, Kevin Ordell? Okay. Good. Bring him in. Whatever she said, I want that positive ID. Mr. Ordell, thanks for coming. - So, this is how it works. - Can you identify the woman you saw? - Just like in the movies. - No. This is the real thing. Focus, please. The women. Identification. Can you? I'm not sure. I thought you said you were sure. Well, ya know. Okay, Mr. Ordell. Try again. Look at each one, closely this time. That one. - Which is that one? - That one. The fourth one. - I saw her. -[DOOR OPENS] I think you may wanna hear this. Excuse me. [DOOR CLOSING] I don't understand what happened. - I had a get outta jail free card. - What does that mean? - I told 'em. - What? What you told me not to, but I thought I had to. The truth. Obviously, you told the same and our two stories corroborated each other. - And that's that? - Well, I wouldn't go that far. They're not pressin' charges for now. No disappearing again for six weeks. They'll Lojack you. They couldn't hold you anyway. They got you on the boat, but not with the gun. DETECTIVE: The truth? All we have is circumstantial. Can't wait to see what happens next. - Oh. I am so glad. - Me, too. - Where is Josh? - He's in his room. - What are you doing here? - I thought I'd just drop on by. - You can just drop on outta here. - Um, you can thank me first. For what? For lying? To me? To Grove? To the company? To the police probably. Or maybe I should thank you for Caroline Manchester and for sharing those photographs. - Where's the hero, your new boyfriend, Sam Penney? - Goodbye, Ken. - Do you know who he is, Ellen? - Yeah. I know who he is. A friend. A lawyer. An ex-student of Grove's. Your new boyfriend works for the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was investigating us, Ellen. He was about to indict Grove and he's gonna indict me. I'm the only one being honest with you, Ellen. SAM: Hey, Josh! Hey. Where you goin', buddy? Hey, Josh, what is it? Josh. Everything's gonna be okay now. You'll see. I don't know what to do. There's fishin', baseball. Loads of things to do. No. What do you mean? - It's my mom. - Well, she's free now. It's all right. - They won't arrest her again? - It won't happen again. It was a mistake. But what if they find out? Find out about what? That Mom shot Dad. No, Josh. She didn't. [STAMMERING] Sh, Sh, Sh, Sh, She did. I saw her. I saw her with the gun. - And then I heard the shot. -[GUNSHOT] The next day, everyone said dad had disappeared. But I knew Mom had killed him. - I believed you. You could've told me the truth. - And what truth is that? About the Securities Exchange Commission. And what you were really up to. I believed you and you were lying. You wanna talk about the truth and lying and believing? I believed you. Every time you changed your story, I took the hook and I swallowed it whole. - And you played me like a fish. - What are you talking about? Josh. He saw you load Grove's gun and go to the dock and then he heard the shot. He heard his own mother shoot his father. Why, Ellen? Why? Money? Jealousy? Revenge? Why am I even askin' you? You'll just tell me another lie. I was gonna call Kasim. But how can I? Josh is so worried about the police taking you away again. The perfect mother. You better think of something believable to tell him. [ENGINE RUNNING] Mom. Where have you been? You said you'd be back hours ago. Josh saw me with the gun. - Well, has he told anyone? - Sam Penney. - He's going. - What do you mean he's going? To the police? I don't think so. He said he wouldn't 'cause of Josh. I thought this was all over, Mom. I don't know anymore, sweetie. You've got to tell him. You've got to. You go on inside. I'll be right there. -[SOBBING] - Go on. [KATIE SCREAMING] Katie! Katie! Katie? Who are you? What do you want? - Who are you? - You know who I am. - Who is he? - I have no idea. - Katie, get over here. - Don't move. I saw you. I saw you that night and they let you go. Not orange. I saw you in that blue slicker. - Who are you? - Of course you know. I was on to them. Your rotten husband tracking 'em. Saw you in that blue slicker. I saw you on that boat. No. That... - That's not what happened. - Katie. - I was... - Katie. - It's too late, Mom. - I don't care who you are. - She's not saying anymore. - They blame me. They fired me for what they did. I didn't do it. Why do you think I broke in here before? To find the proof. - You work for Samara? - I had a job. My life gone because of what they did. - And you were in on it. - It's all right. Just let her go. It's me you want. It's me you have to deal with. Go on, Katie. Go get Josh and go. Don't! Just stay. Mom. - I said go. -[CRYING] If you saw me on the boat, why are you here? You know, I was gonna do it. It was my job to kill him and you took that away from me. - Then you should be thanking me. - Josh. - Get him, Katie. - Oh, no, no. You knew. - Go. - You were part of it, too. And they, they let you go. - No, I wasn't. - Yeah? Sure. - Well, it's too late now. - Ahhh. Katie, run. Go, Josh. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [INDISTINCT VOICE FROM RADIO] WOMAN: Copy fourteen. Lincoln eight four fifty-nine at the McCarthy residence. Watch your head, sir. MAN OVER RADIO: Roger that. Meet you inside. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ELLEN: I couldn't stop thinking about that man. Just coming into my house with a gun. That ruined man. And I realized it's not the affairs or the money. It's all the lives that are the consequences of what Grove did. I mean, I don't blame that man for wanting revenge. I know how he felt. Dear Sam Penney. I have to tell somebody. I have to tell you what happened. For my mom. Maybe for me, too. Are you sure this is a good idea? I've got homework to do and Mom will be mad. GROVE: That's great. I'll help you with your homework. I was an A student, you know. And we'll call Mom. You be careful goin' down there. I'll tie this up. [COUGHING] Whoa. - Where are they? - Ah! They must've went back up to the house. Josh wasn't feeling well. Well, can we go? Well, we'll call. It's busy. She's probably tryin' to call us. Well, let's just go back to the house. No. I'll, I'll call again in a minute. Sit down. Maybe this is... Maybe this is good. Give us a chance to talk about last weekend. I, I may not see you for a while, and I wanted to apologize. I'll try again. Busy. Maybe it's the storm or... just bein' down here. [SIGHS] I am truly, truly sorry. - I felt so bad. - Yeah. Don't feel bad. It wasn't you. It was my fault. Okay. So there I was, I was goin' up to meet the President and just as I got in front of the First Lady, I, I hooked my foot on the rug or somethin' and I fell right on my face. - Right in front of her. -[BOTH LAUGHING] Secret service had to pick me up. I wasn't even drunk. -[LAUGHING] - You're such an idiot. - You can say that. - I meant, Dad, that we did this. - But wherever Mom is, I have to get going. - Ah. - No more. No, no. - I just wanted to make up for what happened. - No. I'll get the dinghy and go home. - Oh, you can stay over. No. Dad, no. I wanna go home. Oh, Dad, Dad. What do you mean, Dad? You can call me Grove. - No. Step or not, you're still my dad. - Ah. Oh. Believe me, it's all right. Katie? It's all right, Katie. - And you'll be fine. You can stay. - Stop it. - It'll be fine. - Stop it, Dad. - Come on, Katie. - Stop it. Come on. KATIE: Get off me. - It's okay. - Get off of me. [SCREAMING] Ow. Get off... Get off me! Get off me! Get off... [SCREAMING] Ahhh! KATIE: I got back to the dock in the rain and the mud, but Mom wasn't home. She'd never been on the boat. She was at Aunt Rachel's. That's where I found her on dad's cell and she came. [CRYING] Sweetheart. Oh, darling. Oh, sweetheart. All right. Okay, baby. It's all right. It's all right. Mom gave me something to sleep. She told me not to worry. That everything would be all right. I didn't know what to do. I could think of only one thing. I took the shotgun. I loaded it. I went to the boat. - I destroyed the evidence. -[GUNSHOT FIRING] And any trace of a neck wound. I made it look like a suicide. The pearls. The pearls. I picked up the pearls. I picked up every one. [SOBBING] [INAUDIBLE] - Uh, I thought you'd gone. - In the morning. What are you doing here? I came back to apologize. To... To tell you... [SIGHS] I don't know. To try and explain. I'm sorry. So am I. I did what I had to do. I regret so many things, Doctor Keller. That's what I have to live with. But all I can do now is, wherever we go, just live day by day and protect my children the best I can, no matter what it takes. And that's the truth.
