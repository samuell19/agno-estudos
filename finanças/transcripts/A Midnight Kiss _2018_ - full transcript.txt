Please tell me you're on your way. Yeah, relax, I'll be there in five minutes. Well, can you hurry? Dad is singing Christmas songs like he's Frank Sinatra. No. All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. Mia, hi. Just wanted to come over to let you know how terrific everything is. This is easily the best Christmas party you and your family have ever thrown for us. The decorations, the music, the food? It's all been spectacular. Well, thank you very much, it's so sweet of you to say. We were worried that we wouldn't have enough staff so close to Christmas but I think we filled it in quite nicely. Are you kidding? It's been amazing to watch your family in action. Yeah, well we didn't plan for my dad's singing but sometimes he can't help himself. Oh, I'm sorry. This is our good friend, Kate Clark. Hi, it's nice to meet you, Mia. And I agree with Jean, you guys have done an amazing job. Well, thank you, and... forgive me, but are you Kate Clark who created Fashion Starter? Well, that depends, are you a fan? Oh, absolutely. The site is addictive. I uh, actually got this bracelet from a young Australian designer. Oh. It's beautiful. And your home offices are here in Seaford. It's amazing. Uh... I am so sorry, um, if you'll excuse me your cake has arrived and I'm needed in the kitchen. Of course. By all means. It was nice to meet you, Kate. Likewise. How are we doing? All we need is some red icing to write "Merry Christmas" and we're good to go. Okay, I'll get the doors. Okay. Thank you so much, you're too kind. You remember my daughter, Mia? Oh, so nice to see you again. It's good to see you, too, Mrs. Morgan. We were just telling your mother what an amazing job your family has done with this party. Yes. Well, it's been a lot of fun to work on. Oh, looks like we're being summoned back to our table. Ah. All right, well here you go. Thank you. It was great seeing you both. Please give my best to Gary. I will. Bye. Look at you, hobnobbing with the mayor. Oh yeah, well, you stick with me, kid, 'cause I know all the important people, see? Mom, you should bartend more often. You look really cute in your bowtie. Okay, you can make all the fun you like but I am happy to sacrifice my pride so that my children don't have to. Consider yourself lucky. You could be walking around as Mrs. Claus if you fit in that suit. Mm-mmn. How's everything going? Even though two eight-year-olds destroyed our cake, Jake has managed to find us another one, saving the day. Great. Uh. Oh, speaking of, that's my cue. Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to announce that Santa has managed to find us a spare cake on his sleigh. Well, that's it, folks. Our last party of the season is officially over. I have to say I think I'm gonna miss the Christmas parties the most. Mom, seriously? Aren't you the one that always complains we have to work twice as hard in December? Yeah, I know, I do, but as tough as they are, I just can only seem to remember how happy we made everybody. That's true. Think of the joy that I brought everyone singing this evening. Dad. You are crazy. Watch it. Woah, that's company property. Well, it's not gonna be the same without you two. Honey, we're retiring but we're only gonna be one little phone call away if you need us. And besides, you two are practically running the company by yourselves already. Yeah, but it doesn't mean we don't appreciate still having you around. I mean, you guys taught us everything we know about this business. And don't you forget it. Do you realize that this will be the first time in seven years that we have not worked New Year's Eve? Has it been that long? Well I certainly hope you two have some fun plans for the big night while we're off in Palm Springs. Actually, I think Lori and I we're just gonna stay in this year. I mean, she's six months along in the pregnancy already and besides it'd be next to impossible to find Emily a babysitter on New Year's Eve. What about you, Mia? I don't really have any plans. Wait, didn't your friend Elise have some party she invited you to in Seattle? I would have thought you would have a whole list of events to go to, honey. Yeah, but do I really want to spend my favourite night of the year packed into a bar with a bunch of people I don't know all hoping to find someone new for a kiss at midnight? Yeah, that's a good point. I'm so happy I don't have to worry about that sort of thing anymore. Right. All you have to worry about is remembering to kiss your wife at midnight. That happened one time. One time! Okay, you're never gonna let me live that down, will you? All right. Don't stay too long. Yeah. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey Jake, I've been trying to get a hold of you guys. It looks like I'm gonna get to your place earlier than expected so if you're not there I'll just let myself in. I'll see you soon. Bye. Jake? Lori? Anyone home? Jake? Lori? Are you there? Woah, woah, woah, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm David! I'm Jake's friend, okay? I'm supposed to be here! Hey, Jake! Hey man, you made it! Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake! Jake, how are ya, man? Hey, Mia, what's, uh, up with the golf club? Oh, hey guys. Aunt Mia! Hey, sweetie. Yeah, so my uh, my flight got in early and I just took an Uber here. I- I did try calling but it just kept going to voicemail. Yeah, reception is terrible around here. But I see you've met my sister, Mia. Yeah. Wait, have... haven't you two met before? Yeah, yeah, no, when you came to visit me in my senior year of college? Yeah. Wait a minute, wait, wait, you had shorter hair, right? Wait, was she-you were the one who fell in the pool! She fell in the pool, remember? Actually, I was... I was pushed. It's a little different. Anyhow, who's hungry, huh? Yeah. Yeah. So, David, uh, remind me again why you're not spending Christmas and New Year's with your family in Arizona. Yeah, so uh, the original plan was to join my family on a cruise but then I got a call from the United Documentary Fund. They give out financing for projects for filmmakers like myself. They want to meet with me between Christmas and New Year's. They're located nearby in Seattle and now I'm here. How many people are you competing against? Uh, it's between me and a couple other applicants. Well I'm surprised they left it for so late in the year. Oh, they had actually chosen someone a few weeks ago but that director got other funding so now I got a shot. Outstanding. Good luck, buddy. Thanks. Yeah, uh, and... and don't worry, I'm gonna be out of your hair for Christmas. I'm gonna go to Sullivan's and watch the basketball game and you guys can have your family time. Absolutely not! Yeah, David, our house is your house. You're not going anywhere. Are you sure? We're sure. There is no way we're leaving you alone on Christmas, buddy. Okay. Well, thank you. Um, that really means a lot to me, thanks. Ooh, I'm so sorry, gang. I have to run. I promised mom I'd meet her at the winter market to do some last-minute Christmas gift shopping. Oh, and don't forget to come over early on Christmas to open presents. Yeah, of course. I'll be there. All right. Bye. Bye. Yeah, I want that. Hey, mom. I'm so sorry, I lost track of time. It's ok, honey. I ran into some friends so it's perfect timing. Thank you. Can you believe that Christmas is here already? No, I can't. This year has gone incredibly quickly. Are you and dad excited for Palm Springs? Yes, we are. It's long overdue. All right, what's the itinerary? I'm sure you have a million things planned. No, actually we are going to leave our schedule open. Yeah, we're just gonna play it by ear. Oh. Mom, no way. Are you sure you're ready for that level of spontaneity? Well, we'll soon find out. Your dad and I just thought we would like to wing it and uh, yeah, with after years of lists and schedules then we're gonna just go with the flow. Ooh. Oh, we're-we're gonna have an extra guest for Christmas this year. David Campos? He was Jake's best friend in college? He was at their house this morning. Campos. Oh, I do remember David Campos. They were uh, they were roommates in senior year. I remember him being a very nice young man who was kinda good looking, if I'm recalling the right person. Okay mom, take it easy. I just want you to keep your eyes open, honey. I appreciate the advice but I'm fine. I know you are but I have been thinking about you and your brother taking over the business and it's very important to keep a little balance in your life. Well, speaking of balance I was thinking of taking a class on film production in Seattle. That sounds great. I like that. I just don't wanna let Jake down when he has so many big plans for the company. If he had his way there would be a Pearson Party Planners in every city. It's true, he does dream big and I love that. And I love that you care about that but I want you to know if you decide to take a different path, you're not gonna be letting anybody down. Okay. Speak of the devil. I swear he has us bugged. Hello, were your ears burning? Hey, are you with mom? Uh, yeah, why? Can you make an excuse to go some place where she can't hear you? Jake? Hello? I've got-I've got bad service. I can't hear you. Jake? Hello? Okay, we're all clear. What's the big secret? I just got a call from Kate Clark. She said she met you at the Coleman Christmas party? She wants to meet with us about a party she wants us to plan. Well that's great! Yeah, we'll set it up for next week. Yeah, well, she's actually flying out this evening and she's gonna be gone for several weeks so she wants to meet with us today at our offices at 6:30. Oh, come on, Jake. It's two days before Christmas. I know, I'm just worried that if we don't see her today, she's just gonna find someone else. Why don't you wanna tell mom about this? Mom and dad are retiring. We have to get used to working without them. And uh, let's not give them an excuse to cancel their trip just to help us prep? Fair enough. All right, I'll see you then. What's this? Hey, did you know Kate Clark's family's worth millions? And her company, Fashion Starter, is one of Style top 30 to watch this year. Mmm, not too shabby. You know, I didn't get to talk to her much at the party but she seems pretty cool and confident. All we need to do is impress her guests and we'll create a whole new client list for the future of our company. Speaking of the future I've been doing a lot of thinking about some things I'd like to do- Hold that thought. Hello? Kate, yeah, no, the door is open, come on up. All right. That's her. All right. Hi. Kate. Welcome, I'm Jake. Um, sorry about the stairs, it's an old building. Oh, no problem. You remember my sister, Mia? Yes, it's nice to see you again. And good to see you, too. Kate, can I get you a drink? Oh, no, I'm fine. Thanks. Well, shall we sit? Sure. Well, uh, first of all, thank you so much for meeting me so quickly. It's our pleasure. So, Jake, I know earlier on the phone I mentioned that I'm leaving on a flight tonight and I wanted to talk to you about a party in late January I wanted your help with. Yep. Well, um, that wasn't exactly true. It wasn't? No, um... I just had to say that so I didn't scare you both off. Scare us off? The real situation is that I'm not really travelling anywhere tonight. I'm here because I just lost my original party planner and his entire staff and everyone he contracted for my party. I'm not sure I've ever even heard of that happening before with a reputable company. Yeah, but what's done is done. The bottom line is I need your help. Of course, we would love to help you, we just need to know what the occasion is and what dates you were considering. Of course. Well, uh, it's one and the same. New Year's Eve. You couldn't possibly mean this New Year's Eve, right? Yep. The one eight days from now? That's the one. And how many guests are we talking about? 100, 125-ish. Uh-huh. Before you say anything, you need to understand how important this night is for me. I have thrown a New Year's Eve party every year for the past six years. If I cancel this party the fashion community will think there's something wrong with my business. It could ruin me. Kate, I am so sorry but it would be near impossible and this is the most difficult week of the year- Double. Excuse me? I will pay you double your usual rate for one week's work. Uh, Kate, would-would you mind if my sister and I just went and spoke privately for a minute? Oh, no, of course. Don't even think about it. This is a recipe for disaster. Just listen to me for one second. Good luck finding anyone who will work New Year's who isn't already booked. Hey, just hear me out. Now, I completely agree with everything you're saying and normally I would agree that we should walk away from this but as you are aware the last few months have not been as busy as we're used to. And we've got rent, insurance, and advertising all due at the start of January. More importantly, think of the contacts we're gonna make. Her guest list is gonna be a who's who of Washington's rich and famous. So, what do you say? Just do it for your big brother. Congratulations, you have yourself some party planners. Yes? Yep. Oh, that's fantastic! Thank you! Oh! Thank you! Oh... Great. Great. Yes. Yes, mom, they are treating me like one of the family. Uh, I-I got to get inside. They're starting to open presents. Okay, well tell everybody I said hello, okay? I love you, too. Feliz Navidad, madre. Bye. Ah-ha-ha. Look at you guys. It's like she's the Queen of England. Oh, there we go. She's better. She's the Princess of Seaford. Ooh. Look mom, this one's for all of us from David. Oh! An ice cream machine! I love it! I love it! I love it! Thank you! Of course. David, you didn't have to. Oh, come on. Who doesn't want an ice cream machine in the middle of winter, right? It looks like this family gift has become an Emily gift now. Thanks buddy. Yeah, of course. All right, it's my turn. Dun-da-da-da! Oh, what could that be? Oh. Surprise. Titanium. You are so beautiful. Run away with me to Palm Springs. I thought he was talking to me. Of course, I was. Uh-oh, there may be one here for you, David. Oh, you didn't have to do anything for me. Yes, we did. Spending Christmas with the Princess of Seaford is more than I could have asked for... But thank you very much. Um... all right. Top Documentary Filmmakers of the 21st Century. This... this really means a lot. Thanks guys. It's a book. See I told you you'd like it. I love it! Thank you, guys! Best Christmas ever. Any left in there? Yeah. Thank you. No worries. I am going to go outside and sit by the fire. Are you coming? Yeah. Sure. Ah... So, when is your meeting at the documentary fund group? Well, uh, it's scheduled for Wednesday right now. And what happens if you get it? Where will you shoot your next documentary? Okay, I uh, I'm planning to spend the next six months, uh, travelling through China. I really want to document the panda population. Oh, that sounds exciting. Yeah, yeah. Um... you know, I've-I've travelled extensively all throughout southeast Asia, uh, for pleasure and for work but I... I've never been to China. Crazy. You're quite the adventurer, aren't you? You know, I wasn't when I was younger. No. Uh-uh. Uh, so right out of college I joined, uh, an old girlfriend for a trip to Thailand, uh, and on that trip we met this film crew and they were documenting elephants. And it was-it was unreal. What happened to the girlfriend? We broke up. She went home. But I stayed, uh, for about three weeks working with that film crew and since then I've been hooked. That's one way to start a career. Yeah. How about you? You seem pretty handy in there with that camera. I've picked up a trick or two over the years. Oh yeah? Well, how long have you been making videos? Oh, since I was a kid. Um, I used to play around with my dad's old Super 8 whenever I could. You ever think about making a career out of it? I used to think about it a lot but as the business took off and my family needed me more and more... I just-I feel like that ship has sailed. Hey, you two. This ain't no free ride. You got to work for your stuff around here. Pearson, you're on table duty. Campos, I need you to peel some potatoes. Can you not see that we're trying to have a creative conversation over here? I'm sure there's plenty of creative ways to peel a potato. Come on. Okay, who's ready for dessert? I'm stuffed but I can't resist. I'd like to raise a toast. Oh dear, here we go. To disco. Oh, come on, dad. How many times do we have to hear this story? It was New Year's Eve. Okay. I was a waitress at a local club. I was wandering through town and I heard my favourite disco song coming from the club so I decided to check it out. He was early, we had only just opened. There she was. The most beautiful waitress I have ever laid eyes on roller-skating towards me to take my order. Was that grandma? That was grandma. I had just learned how to roller-skate and I certainly hadn't learned how to stop, so... There she is, coming towards me, she's getting closer and closer and I'm thinking hmm, she's not slowing down. Nope. And I crashed right into him and we both ended up on the floor. So, it was... Love at first crash. Yes, it was. That's his favourite line. Oh, wow. I got it. No, no. I'll give you a hand. I'll supervise. I'll eat dessert. Mm-hmm. Good idea. Almost finished. Nice and slow, son. You got it. Yeah, yeah, not-not too slow 'cause my hands are about to freeze off, man. Come on. You did what? Mia, what are you thinking? Mom, it was a spontaneous decision, we didn't have a lot of time to think about it. But honey, that's- that's six days from now. You can't get anything done in six days. I get it, but what's done is done and Jake is right. This could be a big deal for the company. Well, then I don't-I don't see how your father and I can possibly go on vacation now. What-no. No, mom, you're not cancelling anything. You're both gonna go on this trip and everything is going to be fine. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Nothing's going to go wrong. Watch out! Watch out! Jake! Are you okay? Gary texted that they're gonna get a bite to eat after the movie so Emily will come home after lunch. Great, thanks. So, what did the doctor say? Well, the fracture isn't too bad but he'll have to wear a cast for a month. The worst part he said I have to keep off it for at least a week. A week? I know, it's the biggest job we've ever had and I've been benched. Okay, that makes it official. We're cancelling our trip. No way. We have to. I... I can handle it, we just need to hire someone to fill in for Jake. We need someone we can trust, now. Like today. Hey guys. Okay, unfortunately they were out of tortilla chips but I got some potato chips. Uh? What, can he not eat potato chips? Quick question. You don't have any New Year's plans yet, do you? No, why? Well, as you can see, I'm out of commission for at least a week, maybe more, so we were thinking maybe you could help us with our New Year's Eve party. You're kidding, right? Yeah, look, I would do anything to help your brother out, right? He's the only reason why I graduated college but I've never planned a party before. Well, you've been to parties, right? Of course. So just think about what makes a party great and then reverse engineer it. I think it's a little easier said than done. Oh, David, come on. You have shot, directed, and produced documentaries all over the world. Compared to that this'll be a piece of cake. You did some research on me. Mm... that's our family motto. Do your homework. Well I'm very impressed. And you are not gonna let me off the hook, are you? We need your help. Okay. Okay. When do we get started? Now. All right. Okay, so let me get this straight. We have six days, but only six days, to find a decent band who isn't already booked on New Year's Eve, locate a caterer who is available on the busiest night of the year, find a good florist in the dead of winter, oh, and a fireworks team who has more than just sparklers which is pretty much all we're gonna find at this point. I think that's pretty much everything. Any other questions? Actually, why-why is this party so important to you guys? Well, as you may or may not know, my parents are retiring soon and leaving the business to me and Jake. This is our first party on our own and if we don't do well then people may be wary of working with us from now on. Okay, I get it. And also, it's the first party of the new year which I believe sets the tone for the years to come. You know, I think-I think I actually read somewhere that we celebrate New Year's because of some Roman god or something, I don't know, I might have just made that up. No, that's-that's true. It's the god Janus, he of two faces. One face always looking back into the past and the other looking forward into the future. Okay. Well, here's to uh, hoping we have a great party in our future. I will toast to that. Hello? Pearson Party Planners here for Kate Clark. Come in, we're expecting you. Look at this place! This place is amazing! Well, we know she can afford the caterer. Yeah. Hi, I'm Paul. I'm Kate's assistant. She's waiting for you inside. Uh, nice to meet you, Paul. Uh, is it okay if I uh, take some photos and video of the property? Um... Yes, of course, just follow the path to the back. Okay. We'll meet up with you shortly. Okay. This way please. Hi, Mia, welcome. Come in, come in. Sorry I look like such a wreck. There are a million things going on with my company, as if I didn't have enough to deal with this week. Can I get you something to drink? No, I'm fine. Paul, just let me know if you hear from the lawyer. Mm. Will do. So, I won't take up too much of your time, we just wanted to check the layout of the house, the atmosphere, and of course, make sure that we're all on the same page. So, where's your brother? Wasn't he supposed to be here as well? I actually wanted to talk to you about that. Jake has had a little accident. Oh no. Is he ok? He broke his leg. Oh, that's terrible. Is it bad? It's bad enough that he won't be able to help me with your party. You're kidding? I mean, not that we need a man to help us do anything as far as I'm concerned but are you gonna be able to pull this off by yourself? I'll be fine. And just in case I even called in a family friend to help me. This is beautiful. Pretty nice, huh? I forget how much I take it for granted until I show it to people for the first time. It really is incredible. Who is that? Oh, that's David. He is Jake's friend. He'll be the one helping me. He's cute. Really? I mean, yeah, I-I guess. I never really thought about it. Oh, so you two aren't- Oh, no, no. Our relationship is strictly professional. Hmm. All right, well, shall we regroup and talk about the party? Absolutely. Right this way. Hey. Hi. I'm... I'm Kate Clark. You must be David. Yes. Uh, so good to meet you. Your house is... it's extraordinary. Thank you so much. I bought it five years ago. Thankfully I was able to make some architectural changes, make it feel a little more my style. Well, my compliments. It... it's-it's incredible. Shall we sit? Yeah. Yes. Uh, okay, so I think we should start with what we have booked and what we still need to set up. With New Year's being so close, only five days away, we're gonna have to make some quick decisions to be on time. Ok, sounds good. Uh, so, what's first? Well, I've managed to secure a fantastic rental house for furniture, cloths, napkins, et cetera. So we need to decide on a theme, the most classic being florals, gold, silver, and of course white. Let's go with gold. It'll pair nicely with the existing colour palate. Absolutely, but may I just make one suggestion? Of course. Maybe we consider going with a black napkin so that the gold really pops. I love that idea. Thank you, David. Of course. Okay. And what would you like for music? Would you like a live band or a DJ? Oh, a band would be nice. Okay, great. We'll make that our top priority. A lot of people will already be booked but don't worry we will find you someone great. Well as long as it's not disco, I'll be happy. Well, that seems like a great place to start. We're going to go meet with the caterers now. Um, out of curiosity, what's your role gonna be in all this? Um... I'm gonna help Mia spend the week focusing on getting a florist and of course, my favourite, uh, someone to handle the fireworks. Sounds great. Well, just keep me updated every step of the way. Here's my card. My personal cell is on the back. Call me for anything you need. Um, thank you so much for coming. You can show yourselves out. Paul? Let's roll some calls. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Look what I found, thank goodness. Flying without a neck pillow is torture. Well, how did you find that? I spent ages looking for it before you guys got here. You know your mother, that's her superpower. Well, I'm glad you guys came to see me before you left. Well, and your place is on the way to the airport and dad wanted to save a few bucks. Drive here and park the car and take a cab the rest of the way. Oh, I see how it is. Two birds, one stone. It makes me feel so special. No, we were always gonna come and say goodbye in person. Oh, Lori called me. Apparently, the doctor said that Jake will be able to walk on crutches by the end of the week. Well, good then. He can help you with the party. Ugh, no. He can make a couple calls but he still needs to get his rest and his friend David is working out so I think I'll be fine. David, hmm? The car is here. Oh, okay. Okay. Honey, you will call me if you have any, any questions or problems, okay? Okay. Promise. I love you. We love you, dear. All right, you relax and have fun, okay? Okay. Hey, got any last-minute opinions on silverware that you wanted to get out of the way before tomorrow? I knew it. It bothered you when I spoke up, didn't it? I'm just kidding with you. Okay, well trust me, I was not trying to step on your toes. I just wanted to help. I know. I appreciate it. So what time are we gonna start tomorrow? Uh, how about 8:00 am at the office? Sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Goodnight, David. Goodnight, Mia. Yeah, we can do this. This is... this is doable. Yeah. And since I've never planned a party before I have no choice but to believe you. Are you ready to go try some food? Yeah. Where to first? The kitchen of our go-to chef Charlene Powell, and you will see why she is our first choice. Okay. And these are our duck leg confit tartlets. They're easy to prep and as you know a crowd favourite. For any gluten-free vegans, I thought the marinated Portobello mushroom polenta crisps. We have the blinis and caviar, scallops stuffed with pea shoots, and the Arancini, and Heirloom tomatoes topped with Burrata cheese. It's delicious. And what are your thoughts on a raw bar selection? Uh, I love that idea but let's also add a charcuterie bar with some cheeses, cured meats just to mix it up. Will do. Okay, and finally, for dessert, we could have a selection of petit fours and individual molten chocolate cake topped with vanilla bean ice cream. I love it. I'll uh, let the client know and get her approval and get back to you tomorrow morning, if that's okay? Sounds like a plan. Thanks again. What's wrong? Do you not like it? No, no, I-I liked it. It was all-it was all good. It was all safe and familiar. It's exactly what people are expecting at a New Year's Eve party. Okay Gordon Ramsay, what's your great idea? Well, you said it yourself. You've worked with her a dozen times, right? Don't you wanna explore something new? I'm listening. Okay, so I know it's somewhere on this block. Well, maybe you were imagining it. I never just imagine good Chinese food. Well, I hope not, because this little excursion is costing us valuable prep time. Hey, trust me, okay? We're close, I can smell it. Oh, there it is. Come on. After you. Okay, I have to admit it, this is pretty good. Yes! Oh. Uh, excuse me. Where did you pick that up? Ah, I started learning a few months ago. Getting ready for the trip to China for the documentary. I'm not fluent but I know how to ask for more. Does it ever get lonely travelling by yourself? Eh, I find ways to make friends. A smile does a lot of the work for you. I really believe that if you have an open mind and an open heart you can pretty much connect with anyone. Isn't it hard not being with your family for the holidays? They live in Arizona so I do get to see them two or three times a year. So it's not all that bad. But enough about me, what about you? What about me? Well, uh, we didn't get to finish our conversation the other night. I'm still curious why you think the ship has sailed on you making movies. Well, the reality is that Jake wants to take Pearson Party Planners to the next level and with mom and dad retiring he needs me to make it work. I can't just walk out on him. It sounds like you spend a lot of time thinking about what they need and not enough time thinking about what you need. David, no offence but you've been travelling the world and living your dream since you left college. Your family hasn't relied on you the way my family relies on me. You're right. Forgive me, that... that... that came across selfish and that was not my intention. But more importantly, what's the verdict on the food? Okay, well it's certainly a different direction and it is delicious... but my concern is that not everyone will like it. Are you kidding me? Who's not gonna like this? Oh, excuse me? Do you-do you guys do catering? Let me ask the owner. Okay. David. It's worth asking. I seriously think if you hire these guys, Kate's guests will never forget it. Hi. Hi. Uh, my friend and I are planning a New Year's Eve party and we were wondering if you cater. It would be roughly 100 people or so. Unfortunately, not. We only have the staff and facilities to handle a party half that size. Okay, that's good to know. Thank you. Well that was fun. You got any more hidden gems you want me to hunt down? I was just trying to get you out of your comfort zone. I like my comfort zone. There are reliable caterers there. Okay. Oh, uh, hold on. Oh, the United Documentary Fund wants to meet with me in an hour. Oh, no worries. Um, I'm meeting with Lori later, she's picking up some stuff for Jake, so we can start fresh tomorrow. Perfect. Sounds good. Oh, why don't I give you a ride there? I like it. So how is he doing? Not bad. He had a check-up and the doctor said that the leg is mending nicely. He's in a little bit of pain but nothing too serious. Well, that's a relief. But, how are you? Are you managing everything okay? It's fine. David and I sampled some food vendors today. How's it going? You two getting along? As well as can be expected for two people thrown into the deep end of the pool together. And are you sinking or swimming? It's too soon to tell. We both have very different styles. He wants to try all the different options before committing and I want to go with what I know I like and just make a decision on the spot. Sounds a little bit like a marriage. Yeah, it kind of is. Just minus the romance. What's that look for? I didn't say a word. You didn't have to. Mia. What? I think you have a crush on David. Lori. Oh, come on. That is the most absurd thing I've ever heard you say. So, I was thinking for the centrepiece we can do a bold assortment of calla lilies to really put a pop of colour on every table. Okay, go on, what do you think? Look, well I... I... I um... I'm no expert, okay? But I do think that with our gold theme and with the colour tones of the house we should probably stick with a... I don't know a... a monochromatic white or an off-white floral arrangement. Oh. Let me... ah, okay. Okay. Now hear me out. What if we went with a simple white rose with Queen Anne's lace. How do you know about Queen Anne's lace? Well, my mom used to make wedding arrangements in our kitchen for extra money. I might have picked up a thing or two. I guess so. So, what do you think? I think you have the right idea but the wrong flower. White roses are so overdone. We should replace it with... ok. White lisianthus. Oh. Okay. Similar to the white rose but with a more ruffled petal. Mm-hmm. I like it. But no flower arrangement is complete without the perfect vase, right? And we need that one. And voila. I like it. You sure you two haven't done this together before? Okay, so that'll be our centrepiece, we'll pick up 20, New Year's Eve morning. Okay. Hey, it was great to meet you. Thank you. Jake knows the owner. He set it up so they would let us audition bands here before they open later. How many bands are we hearing? Well, our usuals are all booked solid of course but I found a few that were still available. Great. Oh, um... I hope it was okay that I offered my two cents back there. As you can see, I waited until you asked. David, I don't mind you giving your opinion. In fact, I... I want it. That's why you're here but maybe just a little... a little less 'cause we're on a schedule and... Understood. A moderate amount of opinions. Exactly. Got it. Let's go. What's this band's name again? Partiovascular. What? The band's called Partiovascular. Nice. That was great, guys. Thank you very much. Great work, guys. Thank you. Look, I'm not saying that I was in love with either of them but, you know, the first band probably appeal to the kind of crowd Kate's inviting. I don't know. I... I agree that neither of them set the room on fire but don't you think the jazz band would be a little more appropriate for a New Year's Eve party? No, who knows at this point? I mean, beggars can't be choosers and we have to pick one of them, so... Yeah. Hi, Kate. Yeah, we just finished listening to some bands at a club called Sound Check. I think we've got some great options. Oh, really? That's only a block away. Ah. Sure. Okay, we'll see you soon. I guess we're sticking around. Yeah. Kate was having dinner nearby and she wants to meet us to go over everything. Didn't seem like she was gonna take no for an answer. Great. I just-I wish we had another option to show her, you know? Yeah. Come on. We won't really know if they're any good unless we actually dance to them. Are you kidding? Do I look like I'm kidding? That was great. You were wonderful. Okay. Hey team. She's here. Ooh. Hey there. They sounded good. Yeah, yeah. They- and they are available on New Year's Eve. I think that you should hire them and then we'll get a DJ to play in between their sets. Well, are the other bands in the running? Uh, in my opinion, no. If you'd like to check them out though I can get the links to their websites sent to you. No, no. That's okay. I trust you, Mia. Great. I will let them know. Woo! So. So. How was the rest of the day? Today was pretty good. We uh, went to the florist and we picked out the centrepieces. Um... you know, you're very lucky to have Mia and her company on board. She... she has such a good eye. I agree and a smart man wouldn't let her get away. Okay. It's obvious that you like her. I won't tell anybody that. No, no, no, we're just friends. Oh, hey. Uh, how'd it... how'd it go? It was great. Uh, they're in. Yes. Great find, Mia. You guys have really put me at ease about this whole thing. Well, thank you very much. And um, on that note I am actually going to head home for the night, return some emails and get started on tomorrow's schedule. Are you sure that you don't wanna hang? Oh, no, you guys stay. You have fun. I will catch up with everyone tomorrow. Goodnight. Drive safe. Just give me a second. Mia! Hey, Mia! I just want to check and see if you're okay. Yeah, sure. Fine. Why? Well, uh, you-you ran out of there so quickly so I- No, not at all. I just want to take care of, you know, contracts and the budget. Not out of the woods yet. Okay. Well hey, look, if you don't want me- David, it's fine. Stop it. Go back in. Don't worry about me. I'll stop. I'll stop. Mia... it was a good day. Yeah. Yeah. Hey Jake, I have you on speaker with David. Hey Jake, uh, what's up, buddy? How're you feeling? Well, I'm hanging in there. I'm sorry if I'm not as helpful as I had hoped. Oh, no worries, we just wanted to, um, let you know where we're at before we do the final walk through the mansion today. Well, I read the email you sent, everything looks good, just make sure you get the insurance paperwork from Global Tent and Party Rentals. Got it. Oh, and great news. Capozzi Fireworks out of Seattle, they'll be able to do the display and they said they'd be handling all of the necessary permits. Great work, Jake. Guys, uh, Kate is gonna be blown away. 'Cause of the fireworks. Get it? All right, well uh, it's time for my mid-morning nap. Good luck today. Thanks, Jake. Later, boss. Okay, uh... I'm starving. What kind of food do you guys got around here? Um, my parents usually have something back there but I can't guarantee it'll be fresh. Let's see what I can cook up. Ooh, actually, you have everything I need to make one of my favourite dishes. Eggs, peppers, tomatoes, and olive oil. Huevos Pericos. Where did you learn how to cook? My grandmother. She was from Venezuela. Um, get this. Whenever my grandfather would make her mad she would, uh, take really hot chillies and throw them in his eggs. Yeah, seriously. Uh, unfortunately for her my grandfather is from Texas and he absolutely loves everything and anything spicy so whatever he was doing to make her mad, he just kept doing it. Remind me not to make you mad. And we cannot forget the final touch. A little for you and a little for me. Dig in. Wow. This is delicious. Thank you, sir. Don't thank me, thank my hot-tempered grandmother. I just got to ask you, um... if-if I was able to pull some strings and, I don't know, get you a job on a TV or film production, would you do it? Right, because there's a million jobs for girls with no experience who work as party planners. Okay, first of all, I got to be honest and say that Jake did show me your work and you are better than half of the people that I come across in my industry. Oh yeah. Yeah... you... you have... you have vision, you have passion, and those are the most important things. And... and as good as you are at party planning it just doesn't seem like that's what you wanna do forever. So, what is really holding you back? My parents built this business. This company kept a roof over my head, put me through school. If I left I'd be abandoning them. I'd be abandoning Jake. Well, I love Jake like my own brother, ok? And you know him, he's a machine. He'll figure it out. Come on. Sometimes you just got to do what's right for you. Well, some of us are not as free-spirited and adventurous as you are. Okay. But in... in... in my defence, I didn't just wake up and become this, you know, jet-setting filmmaker. I'm just kidding, but I was so lost coming out of college. I- I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I was travelling so much 'cause I had nothing worth coming home to. You know, it's crazy. Had... had I not met that... that film crew in Thailand who knows where I'd be today? Well, as much as I appreciate your encouragement, regardless of what you may think, I am happy with my life and we have to focus on the party. Hey, hey, hey. I wasn't trying to... Really, it's fine. Uh, we... we are gonna be late, though. We're gonna be late. We have Blue Point oysters, Maine lobster, and Alaskan King crab legs being flown in fresh. Sounds great. And there's gonna be a tent set up right here to cover this entire area. Scattered tables will be set up by the end of the day, you can give your welcome speech at 9:00 pm, and then the band will start playing. Did you get that? We'll have a champagne fountain set up here with flutes surrounding it for midnight toasts. Your band and DJ will be set up inside right over there facing outward and the dance floor right at the back of the house. And the DJ will take over for the band in between their sets and then at midnight when the band leaves the DJ will play until the last of your guests also leaves. You asked me to remind you about the video. Oh, yes. And all of this will be captured on video, right? Video? I don't believe I was made aware that you needed a videographer. Oh, absolutely. I want to send out a post-party email with a link to the video. Everyone does it these days. Of course. We will find someone. You never say no. I love that about you. Ooh, you have a conference call. Oh, yes. I'm sorry, I have to take a call. I will catch up with you guys later. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, well don't worry about the video thing. If we can't find anybody I don't mind shooting. I have won a couple of awards. You and me will have our hands full. You know, we'll just shoot some key moments and cut it together next week. Sounds good. All right, these guys are gonna need all the help they can get. Are you ready to get your hands dirty? Let's do it. Come on. Pretty impressive, Miss Pearson. Why thank you, Mr. Campos. We're almost there. Mm. Okay, fun fact. Did you know that in Estonia on New Year's it is good luck to eat 12 times before midnight? Twelve times? Mm-hmm. Can't be true. Oh, so true. I was working there a few years back on New Year's Eve and I actually ate 12 meals. Well, what happened then? For starters, I didn't make it to midnight, and I ended up in a local hospital with food poisoning. You're laughing? I am-I am expressing and sharing a moment where I almost died and you are just laughing at my misery. I'm sorry. No, it's... it's okay. I will never share any of my pain with you ever again. Okay, your turn. What was your most memorable New Year's Eve? Ooh... senior year of college. My boyfriend had dumped me earlier in the week and I wasn't in a very festive spirit so I decided not to go to any of my friends' parties and to stay home and eat a quart of ice cream. That is so sad. I was heartbroken, what do you expect? Anyway, well, 20 minutes to midnight the doorbell rang. Oh. It was my three best friends. They had left the biggest party in town to spend New Year's with me. And I remember we all went up to the roof and watched the fireworks. We all had a glass each of really bad champagne and I still cried that night but it was because I was laughing so hard. It was a year of new possibilities. A fresh start. It made me feel like everything was going to be okay. Mia? I'm so sorry, Mia. I don't mean to interrupt, but the decorators are having some issues out front. Ah, duty calls. Thanks. Okay, let's see these. So, it sounds like congratulations may be in order? For? Ah. Yeah, the phone call from earlier. I uh, I got the grant. David, congratulations. That's fantastic news. Thanks, guys. Is it just me or are you not as excited as I expected you to be? Oh, no, no. No, no. I'm um, I'm stoked. I just... I'm gonna have to leave for China a little bit earlier than planned now, so... Hey, should we try these on? Come here. But that was always the plan, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was. I just... I guess I didn't expect to, uh, have such a good time here this week. Thanks for helping me, David. I love them. Ah, yes, you're very welcome. Come on, Emily. Let's go take a photo for grandma and grandpa. Hey, David, you know you're welcome to stay here as long as you like. We love having you around. Thank you. Thank you. I uh, I really appreciate that, I do. But I think it's time. You know, I got to get to China, start pre-production. Yeah. I should probably get going. I got to go pick up your sister and then take her to the mansion, so... Hey, buddy. Thank you for all of the hard work you've done for us and good luck today. And call me if you need anything, all right? Thanks, man. Hey, happy New Year. Right back at ya. David take off? Yeah, he went to pick up Mia. Let me ask you something. Do you think he's falling for her? Well, let me see. Your sister is single, smart, beautiful in every way, shares similar interests to David, and for the past five days they've basically been joined at the hip. So yeah, I'd say he's fallen for her. Yeah, I shoulda seen it coming. Relax. They're gonna be fine. Trust me. Ooh. What are you doing? This is just another work event. You're acting like you're going to prom. This is ridiculous. Stop it. Hi, David, I'm just running a little bit late. No worries. Take your time. I'm gonna go grab some coffee on the corner. Great. That sounds great. Okay. I am so sorry. I'm usually never late. Don't worry, we got plenty of time. Here, enjoy your New Year's coffee. Thank you. You ready for today? I am indeed. It's my mom, this'll just be a minute. Hi, mom. Happy New Year's Eve. Hi. Hi, honey. I'm just calling to check in and wish you luck for tonight. How are things going? It's going well. You know, a million things to worry about, as usual, but no major hiccups just yet. How about you? You and dad enjoying Palm Springs? Yes. Ye- Your father wants to move here now. Hey, honey! Goodness. In fact, last night he got up on stage with the band at the bar near our place and sang with them. Oh, those poor locals. But as much fun as we're having we're really excited to come home and see everybody. Well, same here. Give my love to dad. Happy New Year! We love you! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Bye, mom. Bye, honey. Sorry about that. No, no, all good. So how we looking today? Good. Catering just messaged me, they've added enough food for 20 more guests just in case, especially since Kate decided to invite her neighbours last minute. Yep, thank you for the surprise, Kate. Well, it's better to have leftovers anyway. And for the first time in my career I don't have to worry about the budget, so it's all good. Yes, that uh, that works for me, too. I approved the DJ's playlist and I told all of the staff to arrive an hour early so they miss bridge traffic. And... that should be about it. Look at you. You got all your bases covered. Before we get started tonight I wanted to say thank you for agreeing to help us- help me- you've been incredibly helpful. I... I don't know how completely true that is but you are welcome all the same. I got to say, I... I've... I've really enjoyed getting to know you this way. It's been fun. Same here. So, you didn't file the permit with the city? This can't be happening. What's going on here? Why don't you ask him? He didn't file the paperwork with the city so we won't have fireworks tonight. It's not my fault. We-we filled out all the necessary paperwork and received the permit from the State. How was I supposed to know we required additional authorization from the city? Okay, will everybody just calm down. This was a mistake. I should have cancelled the party when my first planner quit. Now I'm gonna be laughed at by everyone I know. I have never had a problem with permits before. He didn't do his job. You better hope that I- Okay, enough! Kate, if you please. Kate. You called us a week away from New Year's Eve to ask for our help. Anybody else would have said no to this gig and I am using my every waking breath to make sure that this party is something all of your guests love, but I need you to calm down, to stop making everyone crazy, and to go inside and get ready for your party so I can fix this problem. Okay? Fine. Paul? Hey, Capozzi. Finish setting up the fireworks. David, come with me. Yes ma'am. Okay, so... what now, boss? We go visit the one person with enough power to save this party. Hello, Mia. Uh, what a surprise. Uh, it's nice to see you again, Mrs. Morgan. Um, this is my friend, David. Nice to meet you, David. Nice to meet you. Come in, come in. Thank you. So, what brings you out here? Uh, we're planning a party at the moment and we're having a little bit of trouble with the fireworks permit. Uh, let me guess, you need to speak to my husband. Come on, he's in his office. Remember, we're being picked up at 4:00. Okay. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Well, I have to tell you, attending four parties in a row on New Year's Eve is not exactly my idea of a good time. You're the mayor, can't you just pick one? I wish. Unfortunately, each party is more work related than social, which I imagine is also the nature of your visit. Uh, yes, sir. Um... well, I'm-I'm involved in the party at Kate Clark's place? Ah, yes. We were invited to that as well. Our fireworks vendor, he secured a permit from the State but he didn't realize he had to get a permit from your office, as well. That's unfortunate, Mia, but your parents are well aware of the rules regarding local pyrotechnics. I know my father usually handles this sort of thing but my parents just retired and they're vacationing in Palm Springs and my brother's broken his leg and is out of commission so I have to handle this one on my own. Ah, I'm truly sorry, but if I bend the rules for you it could easily come back to haunt me later. I just can't take that risk, especially not in an election year. Hey, these-these photos are beautiful. Especially these over here. They-they look very familiar. By any chance were these taken in Wamba? Actually, they were. I was there a few years ago with a charity that builds schools in Kenya. Have you been? Yeah, yeah. I uh, I... I spent 18 months there working with the uh, Endangered Wildlife Foundation of Africa. Ah, that's a great cause. You know what else is a good cause? Keeping the largest business owner in Seaford happy on New Year's and on election year. Please, Mayor Morgan, we need your help. This will be a one-time only favour, Mia. And you have to keep this between us. I promise. Of course. Okay. Let's do this. Well, that went better than expected. Yeah, tell me about it. I got to say, for a minute there I thought it was hopeless. I got to say, I think you and I worked pretty well together in there. Let's not pat ourselves on the backs just yet. We still have a whole party to throw and only three hours to get it done. Yeah, I mean, for the most part we're, uh, pretty good. How's the leg? That's good to hear. All right, well thanks for checking in, Jake. Talk to you later. Very nice. Thanks. You clean up pretty good yourself. Just the two people I was looking for. So, it turns out we may have a problem. Ms. Clark has let me know that the head count has increased and she requested that we continue serving an hour past midnight, which we did not plan for. Okay, we'll figure something out, you get back to prepping. Okay. That's not good. Wait. What're you thinking? Why don't you call that Chinese restaurant and see if they can help us out? That's a good idea. Oh, the band has just arrived. I'm gonna help them set up. I'll take care of the food. Hey, guys. Welcome. Your stage is gonna be right in there, so you can set up. Thanks again, Mia. Ok, so I need you to check on... Oh, no! It's okay. It's fine. It was my fault. Keep doing what you were doing. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Yeah, I'm gonna need 75 pieces of Ho Ga. Mm-hmm. And 75 more of Char Siu Bao. And I'm also gonna- David? Oh, hold on. Sorry, but have you seen Mia anywhere? Uh, last time I saw her she was headed through the back room through the foyer. Okay. Thanks. Sorry, uh, I'm gonna have somebody come pick it up. Okay. Happy New Year. Okay. Mia? Mia, it's Kate. Are you in there? I really- Oh, I knew we were going for a gold theme tonight but that's a little much, don't you think? I had a run-in with a tray of gold paint. I can see that. Come on. Where are we going? I can't exactly have my party planner walking around like an Oscar statue, can I? Let's get you changed. Um, Kate, I'm really sorry about earlier. Oh, don't worry, it's fine. But I mean I wouldn't usually- Mia, it's fine. I was out of line and you took control of the situation. It's exactly what I would have done. Well, I'm glad to hear that. I thought you were gonna fire me on the spot. I'm not sure if you know this but I grew up with four older brothers. My late father groomed each of them to follow in the family business while he bought me horses to ride. I think he loved me very much but he didn't really know me. So eventually I took my life into my own hands and got an MBA. A few years later I launched my first company. That's incredible. I wish I had that confidence. Confidence comes from stepping outside your comfort zone. Once you take a leap of faith you'll find yourself where you wanna be. Sounds like something David would say. Speaking of David... when are you two gonna get together? And don't give me that surprised look. I won't pretend that there isn't something between us but David's first love is his work and wherever in the world that takes him and I don't think he has room for anything else right now. Well, it's New Year's Eve. Anything could happen. Put this on. Oh. Okay. Put those on, and those. And this. Help yourself to all my make-up and hair products and I will meet you downstairs. Kate. Thank you. You're welcome. Now hurry up. We've got a party to throw. Hey, has uh, has anyone seen Mia? Wow. You... you look incredible. Thanks. Uh, you don't think it's too much? No. No, I, uh... I wouldn't change a thing. So, how's it been going down here? Oh, well I've got some good news and some bad news. Uh, the good news is the Chinese restaurant's having a slow night so they will absolutely help us out with the extra food. The bad news is they have no one to deliver it to us. Well, Jake's place is half a mile from there. Lori could drive one of the company vans. She wouldn't have to do anything. The restaurant staff could load the van and then our staff could unload it, she would just have to drive. Okay. I mean, it couldn't hurt to ask. The party's in an hour and... I think we're gonna pull this off. I got to say, I think you're right. Of course. How's everything looking down here? Well, we overloaded the electrical system. I'm trying to get us on the generator but I can't find the manual override switch. Found it. Yes, you did. Oh, wait. Hang on. Sorry. Thank you. Can't take you anywhere. The party. Yeah. After you. Thanks. Lovely to see you. For you, Ms. Clark. Thank you, Paul. Bryan, so nice to see you. So, uh, two questions. Is that extra food coming and do you have any extra staff you could spare to help us? Four of my servers didn't make it because of traffic. I will check on the food but unfortunately, we're uh... a little thin on staff but I will see what I can do. Okay. Let me know if you hear anything. Absolutely. David. I've been looking for you. What're you up to? I'm waiting for the van because Lori's coming with the food. Well, she better get here soon. The guests are eating up a storm and Charlene just told me that she's understaffed. What could you possibly be smiling about right now? Come here. What is this? Mom? Dad? Look at you. You look stunning. Well, we understand you need a little help, is that true? Fair warning, we're not cheap. But I don't understand. How are you even here? Well, we talked to you and then we talked to Jake and then we were wanting to be with you on New Year's Eve, so... It wasn't until we landed that your brother found out that you might need a few extra hands, so here we are. It's true. Lori filled me in on the food situation. I called Charlene and she told me about the lack of staff. We know that you can do this on your own but while we're here you might as well put us to work. We're your family. No matter where we are, we're here for you, honey. I love you guys. Ok, um, mom, dad, Charlene definitely needs you immediately in the food tent, it's right out back. Lori, why don't you find some of the catering staff and get them to help you unload the Chinese food you just brought? Ok. And Jake, should you even be on that?! Well, I'm limited in what I can do physically but I can always schmooze. All right, you get inside and you start schmoozing. All right. Be careful. And you had nothing to do with this? My lips are sealed. Okay. Oh, speak of the devil. This is my sister, Mia, I was telling you about. She's the real hero of the evening. Happy New Year. Happy New Year! Have a great night! So how is networking going? Do you need more business cards? Very funny, but I actually did run out. I'm not even kidding. Mia, this is all because of you. You did this. Oh, come on. You helped, too. You made a couple phone calls, didn't you? No, I'm being serious. You made this whole night happen without me or mom or dad, and I think it's gonna take this company to the next level. Well, this was an important night and I didn't wanna let you guys down, and... Yeah? And I wanted to leave the company in a good position. This is your last party, isn't it? Jake, this has been an incredible week for me. It's helped me realize what I- what I want in life and I feel like I have to follow my heart and move on. I hope you understand. Of course, I do. I'm just surprised it took you this long to tell me. Really? Yeah, really. Look, I... I love how we've all been able to work so well together as a family all of these years, but it's mostly because of you. Stop it. You'll make me cry. Look... I guess what I'm trying to say is... you go follow that dream. I'm gonna be fine. Pearson Party Planners is gonna live on even with just one remaining band member. Hey, it's almost midnight. Don't you have someone you should be with? Hey. Hey. Thank you. I... I guess you pulled it off, huh? I'll be happier after it's midnight. Hey, did you see Jake? He broke his leg less than a week ago and he's still out there hustling. Even a broken leg can't keep that guy down. Oh, no, no. Cheers. Cheers. So good to see you. You know, I've been thinking about something. I'm listening. Well, I came here, you know, to get money for my film, and the plan was for me to get on a plane afterwards and fly to some faraway place like I always do. But then I met you. Something's changed in me and... nothing else matters anymore. All I ever think about is you. What do you think about this? Okay, if you want to stay here, I'm gonna stay here with you. But if you wanna come to China with me we can make a film together and have the adventure of our lives. It's funny. When you got here, I thought to myself how am I going to spend a whole week with this guy? But now I, um... I can't imagine my life without you. So, if you're asking me if I'm ready to follow my dreams... six, five, four... I'm in. Three, two, one! Happy New Year everybody! Happy New Year, Mia.
