Welcome to Boston for the 2017 AFC Championship game between the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers. New England wins the toss here at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Game's about to start! These two teams fighting for the right to play down in Houston. Hey, game's about to start. Everyone to your spots. I got my tea. Somebody get the guacamole. We didn't make guacamole. Chips with no guac! I can't believe we have to do this. It's our tradition. Trish, you're in the dining room. Get the magazine. You were reading the magazine. I can't see from in here! There you go. Yeah. Oh, thanks. I'm going to my chair. Betty! What? I'm standing next to it. Just get on the ladder. Get up on the ladder! All right! Here I am. Ladder! I'm on the ladder. I think it's a fun tradition. Yeah, 'cause you're sitting on the couch, drinking tea. Yeah, sipping. Drinking is vulgar. I sip. Lou, I have to tell you, this really doesn't affect the outcome of the game. It's just a silly superstition. Well, what happened in week eight? Well, I was standing on the ladder fixing a lightbulb that was flickering and driving me crazy. Exactly. You were up on the ladder at kickoff. Trish was in the dining room reading her magazine, Maura was drinking tea-- Sipping. And I spilled the chips. And what happened? We beat the Bills. We killed the Bills. We killed the Bills. - Why chance it? - She's got a point. Oh! There's Tom. Oh, what a beautiful man. - Gorgeous. - Oh, my goodness. He's so well-hydrated. I prefer Gronkowski these days. We know, Trish. We've all read your Gronk erotica. It's not erotica. It's fan fiction. Very sexy fan fiction. No kidding. Oh, my God! Oh! Get her a new tea! I was distracted. Trish, get her a new tea! Sorry, guys! It's almost kickoff! It's not hot! Just use the faucet! I-I prefer it hot. Okay? Maura, I've got your tea. Lou! The chips! Oh, shit, the chips! Kickoff in two, one-- It's kickoff! Well-- Oh, nice work! Touchback. Tom Brady comes out. Once again, 33rd postseason appearance. The hold by Ryan Allen. Cardona snaps it back. The kick is good. All right! Okay! Brady completes. All right. Okay. We're on the board. That's good. Third and long! This is our song! Third and long! This is our song! Yes! ♪ We've got it all In store for you ♪ ♪ From the Berkshires To the shore ♪ ♪ Mayflower Auto Mart and more ♪ Oh, man! She's new. She is pretty. Oh, she's just a knockoff of you. You're the original Mayflower Girl. You're just as beautiful now as you were back then. Oh, God. Thank you. Yes. You know what it cost me to look like this? A fortune. Give 'em the curse. Okay. Hands! Third and goal. Breath! A hike to the 19... Okay, a toast. To the man who brought us all here: Tom Brady. Who never gives up, no matter what he's up against. May the hand of fate continue to bless him with perfect spirals and the confidence to stand tall in the pocket. To Tom. To Tom! To Tom. To Tom. To Tom! And to our quarterback, the woman who brought us together and made this our tradition. No, I didn't plan on all this. Here we go. This is it. Five, four, three, two, one, Tom Brady! We're going to the Super Bowl! Good job. We did it! Oh, boy. So, I suppose that gives us two weeks to plan the Super Bowl party. Shall we all bring appetizers? Why not? Can I bring Carl? You know, things are getting serious. - Who is he again? - The handsome one. They're all handsome. What if we went? Oh, Trish, you fall in love faster than any other human on Earth. Well, we can't all be with the same man for 50 years, Betty. Fifty-one. Let's all go to the Super Bowl. Oh, no, Lou, we've looked into this. We-- We can't afford it. No, the tickets, the hotels, it's too expensive. Two years ago, I could've paid for us all to go. - But I divorced Ralph two weeks before the playoffs. - Oh, geez. Boy, do I regret that. The divorce? No, he was terrible. But the game was amazing. Maura! Oh, Maura. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just that every time I hear that word "divorce," I just think of Francisco. You know? Oh, Maura. No, no. Your husband didn't divorce you. He died. It's the same thing. I'm serious. Let's go to the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is no place for four old women. This could be Tom's last one. He's almost 40. That's like 80 in people years. Yeah, we're 80 in people years. Exactly! If Tom Brady can make it to the Super Bowl, so can we. I'd like to clarify, I'm not in my 80s. Neither am I. ...on this momentous occasion. We are gonna do something insane for our Pats Nation. Oh, it's Nat and Pat. I love those guys. That's right. We're gonna have a Super Bowl ticket giveaway. Aw, baby! Our four lucky fans will get to travel down to Houston to see the Pats take on the Falcons. Just call the hotline. Call the hotline, leave us a message. Tell us your story. Explain to us why you deserve those tickets better than anybody else. Yeah. And we're gonna announce the winner to our listeners at the Super Bowl. That's how we go! It's a numbers game. This is not a numbers game. So don't leave us a thousand messages. We don't want 'em. Please! We just wanna hear your story. And who knows? Maybe we'll see you in Houston! Houston! See? He said the best story wins. We've got a great story. We're the biggest Pats fans there are. We love Tom Brady. And we're all over 80 years old! I'm 75. So, let's experience a Super Bowl. Because this might be our last chance. God, that's morbid. Well, we gotta work with what we got. We're gonna do this. Bring it in. Yeah. Yeah. Bring it, bring it. Yes. Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm in. Super Bowl on three. One, two, three. Super Bowl! Hello, my name is Betty-- Elizabeth Bachman. Look, I crunched the numbers and based on your viewership, my friends and I have about a .00013% chance here. So, I realize that the probability - of me winning this contest is very, very low... - Honey! ...but I used to be a professor of applied mathematics at MIT, back when there were only two other women in the whole department, so I'm used to the odds being against me. Honey? I have to run to class. Have you seen my watch? It's on the mantel over the fireplace. You're also gonna need pants. Pants? Oh. Right. What would I do without you? I just really need this trip. Thank you very much. Oh. What do you think of my-- my paper? I'm gonna submit it to the journal. Look, I love your principal points, I do, but the whole paper right now is rather confusing. And you can't expect people to understand unless you weave the concepts together a bit better and-- Pants. Yep, pants. Right. Hi. My name is Maura, and my friends and I are die-hard Pats fans. Which wasn't always the case growing up in Oregon, where my mother was a lumberjack-- That's great, but if we want the advantage here, it has to sound like a real story. So let's keep it believable. Right? All right. Sure, Maura. Okay. But she really was a lumberjack. Being bullied in elementary school was hard. And then when middle school came, things got much worse. Much, much worse. And my mom started picking on me too-- Uh-- Uh-- Don't make it so sad. It's about the best story wins, not the saddest story. Okay? Thank you. Hello? Yes. Uh, my name is Maura, and my three friends and I are dying. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. We're-- We're dying to go to the Super Bowl. Oh, right. Yeah. Oopsie. Mmm. Yeah. Hey, Maura. Thank you for including me in all of this. This is a lot of fun. Oh, good. Hey, do you think you could round up some more residents? Because some of these performances aren't helping our odds. You got it. Thanks, Mick. I mean, this guy is like Caesar. No, he's perfect. And he's like Genghis Khan. "My friends and I are die-hard"-- No, no. "My best friends and I are die-hard Pats fans. We're all ladies over 80 who love Tom Brady. Twenty years ago, we didn't know anything"-- No, no, no. "It was 16 years ago. I'd just finished my last round of chemo, and my three best friends had come over to cheer me up." How about some TV? Mmm. So third down and ten now. Big play for the Patriots. I can't change the channels. Oh, I can do it. Yeah, it's not working. Remote's been acting funny. I got it. Shaun Ellis, 92... ...was carrying... Oh! What do I do? What do I do? Don't hit it. I already hit it. Unplug it. Hold on. Two minutes left in this game. Drew Bledsoe is out. They're gonna have to go with their backup QB. Tom Brady, the second-year quarterback from the University of Michigan. Who's that? I think anybody could tell by looking at Bledsoe... He is cute. Oh, I'll watch this. I can turn myself down. "Maybe it was luck, maybe it was destiny, but at that moment, the Patriots' backup quarterback got called off the bench." I think that has to be so difficult. Oh, my God. "We eventually got the remote working, and one week of football became two." You know, for a game where a bunch of guys just smash into each other, it's really very complicated. There are so many patterns, and if you analyze the data, you will find-- We're just starting to enjoy it, Betty. Don't make it about math. Oh. Okay. "And two weeks became a season." "Tom and the Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl that year. And I, well, I'm still here, thanks to my team." And to Lou, our quarterback. You didn't! "And just like that, we had a new tradition. That's why it would mean the world to us to win these tickets." What are we talking about? All right, Pat. Look, I'm glad you asked. Tonight is the end of our ticket giveaway, and we have received a record number of submissions. But, hey, look, you still got as about a good a chance as being the 199th draft pick and going on to become the four-time, soon to be five-time, Super Bowl champ. We need one for the thumb here. Or you could still try and buy your tickets online, but for four tickets, you'd have to sell your car. Well, not your car. Yeah. My car's garbage. My-- In your case... "My best friends and I are die-hard Pa"-- This isn't gonna work. Oh, what do I do, Tom? What do I do? Let's go. CarMax of Andover, how can I help you? Lou, what's going on? You're acting very strange, Lou. Just keep your eyes shut. Lou, I've got to get home before dinner. It's craps night. You've got your own house, Maura. Why are you still living in a retirement center? Frank loved it very much. Okay, look. Oh! I love presents. I love presents. Whoo! Oh! Oh, my gosh. What is happening? I wanted it to be a surprise, but all they had were gender reveal boxes. Who's having a baby? No one. It's not a gender reveal. It's just a reveal. Of what? We won the tickets. We're going to the Super Bowl. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! These are tickets. How did that happen? How did that happen? Teamwork. I just did what Tommy would do. Who cares how it happened? We're going to the Super Bowl! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Welcome back to Pats Nation. The Super Bowl is only three days away, and I am more excited about this than my own wedding. I'm much more excited about it than I was about your wedding. No, Carl. I did not agree that we could see other people. That's not dating. That's cheating, and I'm done talking about it. I do not want to talk to you. I'm not interested in anything you have to say. Wow, this chapter is really good. Oh, it's so steamy. No, it's not finished. No. Not you, Carl. With you, it is finished. Oh, Lou, I need a hug. I need a hug. Oh, baby. You're too good for that one anyway. Oh, God. I'm just... Betty's right. I-I'm-- I have to stop falling in love. No. You can fall in love. Just maybe wait till you've known them more than a week. Maybe I just stay home. And mope around? No. We're going to the Super Bowl to enjoy men the way the Romans did: sweaty, piled on top of one another. Tight pants. Okay. So this one's for your blood pressure. It says take twice a day. And this one's for you to go to sleep, so it's very important you only take it before bed, all right? I-- I'm sorry. What? This one is for your blood pressure. Twice a day, okay? And this one is to help you sleep. It's important to take sleep seriously. But only take it when you're ready for bed, okay? Because... All right, let me know if you need anything else. Oh, before you leave, have you finished making the corrections? Honey, you really need to take another pass at it. I mean, you need to add your own voice. Well, you know my voice better than I do. No, no, no. I don't. I never did. Listen to me. Okay. You can do it. Okay. I think so. Okay. Mind if I come in? I see your bags are packed. So where you headed? Super Bowl. Super Bowl. Really? Yeah. No, you're kidding? Mm-mmm. Oh, man. You know, I used to play football. High school. Yeah. Mmm? I was a wingback. A little undersized, but the coach always said I had great feet. My husband always said that I had great feet. Mmm. But he just really liked feet. I heard that he passed away. Was it last year? Yeah. Oh. Yeah. My wife, uh, she passed away too. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You know, these things happen. Hey. If you need someone to accompany you to the Super Bowl... Thank you so much, but I'm already going with friends. Thank you. But, hey, there is a lot going on in this place that you should explore. Mm-hmm. Yep. There's-- No, really. There's pool aerobics. There's, um... There's dancing. There's game night. Yeah. Uh, lunch. Yeah. Lately, I've... been realizing that it's less about what you do, more about who you do it with, you know? I look around this place, and... you're the only one I really wanna be around, you know? It seems like you got it all figured out and... Talking to myself. Stop honking. Betty hates it. She thinks it's bad manners. I know. That's why I do it. You know, you didn't have to honk so many times. One toot is enough. Uh-- This trunk is full. Lou, why didn't we take your SUV? It's in the shop. Don't worry, Betty. This thing has plenty of room. It's a '93. It is? It's-- They don't make them like this anymore. They don't make this model like they used to. Oh, boy. We are a mere two days away from the Super Bowl. Yeah. Houston better get ready. I think they're gonna run out of beer. Oh! Tight brakes. What you want me to do? Not stop? She's not answering. I've called about ten times. Here, I'll get her. It's the truth. Pacing will not help. Well, it can't hurt. Afternoon, Bill. Here he is. Here he is. Hey, ladies. Yes. Hello. I'm sorry. I went and checked, but Maura's sleeping. Please wake her up. Please just wake her up. We don't just wake anyone up here. It's a very strict policy. It's part of our core philosophy. We take sleep seriously. See? Oh! Uh-- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Mmm. Mm-mmm. - Oh, damn it. Maura! Maura! Oh, oh. Ladies. Seriously. Shh! Please, please. Maura! Okay. Okay, we're going. Thank you. We just had a moment. Thank you. You guys are very fast. That's a good sign. Where's Maura? She's sleeping, and the manager won't let us in to wake her up. What do we do? We're gonna miss our flight. I got it. I came prepared. There's no way we're gonna make it. Where-- What are you doing? Are all your suitcases just wigs? Let's go. So you still get the cute little face, but you don't get all the breathing problems. Oh, that is fascinating. Do you have any photos? Oh, yeah. Sure. All I have is pug photos. Look at this guy. Oh, look at that. That's Toffee... Uh-huh. ...and that's Bobby right there. Let me show you. Can I take you on a tour? Wow. They have a cooking class. Wow. Look at that chef. Maura was right. It's Emeril in there. They have absolutely everything here. She's been wanting me to take a pottery class with her, but honestly, I can't see myself throwing a pot. I hope that you feel like you used your time with him wisely, because you lied to him. Excuse me. Does anyone know where Maura Martinez is? Wait for the commercial. She's in her room. Here, I'll take you. Come on, man. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Sorry. Yeah. Well, I think she's sleeping. Well, thanks, um... Mickey. Look, Mickey, our flight is leaving in three hours and 23 minutes. I'll, uh-- Okay, well, I'll be here. I'll be right out here. Maura? I'll just be standing guard out here. Maura? Oh! Maura? Maura? Honey, I can do this. Ma-- Okay. All right. Maura. Maura! She's got a pulse. I can't read that. Sleeping pills. Oh. Get a wheelchair. Get a wheelchair. Mickey? Oh, Mickey, good. Yeah? Could you possibly get us a wheelchair? A wheelchair? Yeah. You're breaking her out, aren't you? Well, no, we're actually-- We're going-- No, you're breaking her out. Okay. Yeah. Well, it figures that she'd have really cool friends. He's getting one. Take these with us. They belong to her. This cash too. Well, that-- I'll give it to her in the car. All right. You'll witness it. You'll see it. Okay. I'm witnessing. Is it clear? Yeah, it's clear. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. All clear. Out of the way. Out of the way. Go ahead. Go ahead. Watch your feet. This way, to the left. To the left. Go, go, go. Here we go. Here we go. That was our deluxe garden suite, but you know our resort is 60 and over, so you might have to wait a few more years to qualify. Oh. Hey! Go! Where are you going? Stop right there. Tony, wait. Do you even care about my dogs? No, I don't. Go. Go. I got you. Hey, she's still sleeping. Come back. Wait. Ladies and gentlemen, Pat Sajak from Wheel of Fortune is in the house. Pat Sajak is here, and he's signing autographs right now. Pat Sajak. Hey, Cecile. What's going on? Where is the party at, huh? - Oh, What's going on? Hey. - There's Vanna here too. - Thank you, Mickey. - Thank you so much. Oh, Trish, there you are. Come on! We did it. Whoo! Wh-What are we celebrating? - Oh, Maura. - We broke you out. We're going to the Super Bowl! We're going to the Super Bowl! What? Oh! We're going to the Super Bowl. I'm starving. Let's go to a bar. I love bars. No kidding. We're not going to a bar so you can talk to men. Lou, I told you I am not gonna flirt. I know this is a girls trip. Well, maybe I'll flirt. I don't think I've ever flirted in my whole life. You can do it. Okay. Okay. Hrishi? You have a nice head. Why, thank you. We'll work on it. Okay. Yeah. Oh, Erhan Suites. Is this great or what? And it's all Super Bowl themed. Yeah, but they only gave us one room. And there's no more rooms in the whole hotel. There's no more rooms in the whole city. At least this one has two beds. Be appreciative. Oh, look. There's Tom. Oh, he's much bigger in real life. That's just a cardboard him. The real him is at least twice that size. Oh, Tom. Make that pass. Make it. I'm taking this one. He's cute. Maura! Who did you pick? Hi. Hi. Mmm? Hey, Mom? Um, hey, I just got a call from the hospital saying they're trying to reach you and you're not answering. They called me as your emergency contact. Is everything okay? Yes, I'm fine. Everything's fine. I-- I just had some tests done. They're calling... to go over them. Why are you whispering? I'm in a hotel room, and the other girls are sleeping. W-Where are you? Uh, New Hampshire. We took a little trip to a bed-and-breakfast. Oh, that sounds nice. Um, Mom, call your doctor back. Okay. Night, sweetie. All right, love you. Night. Love you. I can't sleep. Me neither. I miss Frank. I miss sleeping next to him. Nighttime's the worst. I just lay there, awake, thinking of him. I feel like I'm just living in the past, and I can't move on. Maura, you're not living in the past. You're right here with us. And we're here for you. I love you. Oh, I love you. Here, section 138, row 30, seats four, five, six and seven. They're so shiny. Can I hold them? - Oh! - Oh! Uh-oh! Caught one. We can't lose those. You're right. Those are gold. Well, clearly, you shouldn't be holding them, then. How many reading glasses have you gone through this year? That doesn't count. Reading glasses are designed to be lost. Okay, fine. Who's the most responsible one? Oh! Me. Okay. Good thing I brought my strap-on. Um... ...I don't think that's what it's called. Sure it is. Look. You just strap... it on. Wow. That's a fanny pack. Not if you don't wear it around your fanny. If you wear it like this, it's a strap-on. And I will keep them safe. Okay. Before we head out, let's look at the agenda. First up, the NFL Experience. Wait a minute, "agenda" sounds like work. I love a good agenda. Let's go to a spa. No. We didn't win these tickets to go to a spa. We came here for football. We're going to have the NFL experience. I can't believe we're actually here. I can't believe it. Oh, my gosh. This place is huge. Look at all the helmets. Oh, oh! I wanna get one for my grandkids. Oh, this is better than my wildest dreams. Not mine. This morning, I had a dream I was going down the Amazon River on a pickle with my papier-mâché children. There's so much here to do. Yeah, well, you don't need a brochure to tell you that. You know what? I've looked at this. If we wanna hit all the booths, we have to average under five minutes for each one except, you know, the big-- Welcome to the QB Countdown. Let's see how many passes you can complete in 45 seconds. I'm good at this. Watch. Next. I know. I know. Oh, I thought you was waiting on your grandson. Nope, I'm here to play. Well, good luck, Nana. I don't want you to break anything. Hey, you sound confident. Would you like to place a little wager on it? Ten bucks says she won't hit more than five. That's not a bet. She wins, she gets your Falcons jersey. Deal. Deal. There you go. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Technically, we don't allow betting here. Hey, Lou. But they don't pay me that much, so let's see how this plays out. Lou! Look up. Yeah. Let's see how this plays out. I'm up here. I'm talking to you. Louella, don't worry about how hard you throw it. It's all about accuracy and touch. All right, now. You're up. - All right. - All right. Ready. Set. Throw. Come on, Granny! Smoke 'em! Smoke 'em, Lou. Oh! Hey, when are you gonna start throwing? For Pete's sake. Ma'am, would you mind your business? I've never seen anything like this in my life. Is there a mute button for her? Oh, oh, oh! Really? I am terrified. Seriously, the eld-- Do you have anything else to do with your life? Oh, you're killing him. You're killing him. Ma'am, you are stressing me out, okay? Oh, really? Is it distracting? I hope so. You dropped your multivitamin. Fancy footwork. Look at that. Man, that is something. Whoo! Oh, my-- Will you back up? That's really unimpressive. Oh, my goodness. Amazing! Ma'am! Six, five, four... She's definitely been day drinking. That's what her problem is. ...three, two, one! You did it! I told you. I knew I'd make it. I knew. That was incredible. Yeah, you, uh, you scored over 20 points, which means you get a free Super Bowl jersey. I want the Brady. I want the Brady. What size are you? I'm not wearing that. We can go double or nothing if you want your jersey back. But if we win, you gotta wear that. Fine. Trish, we're in Houston. Can't we get some barbecue? Oh, your book! Look. They have it. Look at-- Sign it. My God. Come on. Really? Yes. I have a pen. It's here somewhere. You're bad. All right. Excuse me, what are you doing? Oh, I'm just admiring these books. Uh, you're gonna have to pay for that. She's signing it. You're-- You're Virginia Ledough? Ledoux. Oh, my gosh. I sell so many copies of your book. And I'm a personal fan. You know what? You guys just go ahead. I'm gonna find some barbecue. I think it's outside. I'll see you in a bit. Are you working on anything new? Actually, yeah. I'm working on a holiday-themed book. I Gronk You a Merry Christmas. Can I preorder? Yeah, absolutely. Holidays are a very sexual time for me. Wow. Uh, hello? Excuse me. Oh. Hi. Um... I'd like to get some wings. Oh, I'm sorry. They're not for sale. This is a spicy wings contest. Really? Yeah. But I must warn you, it gets really intense. They got spices that sound like they're from a horror film. Like what? California Reaper... Whoa. ...ghost pepper, Teddy Bears Picnic. Now, that one's the most scary 'cause it sounds like it's all warm and cuddly, but it's not. It's really not. Oh. Well, I could use a little spice. This ain't no little spice. And this is his contest. Guy Fieri. Oh. I mean, look at him. He even looks spicy. I'm in. You sure? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna need your emergency contacts in case something happens. Well, that would be my husband, Mark. But don't call him. Don't call him. I don't want him knowing I was doing this. If you black out, you don't want me to call your husband? No. Don't call him. So who do you want me to call? An ambulance? Yay! Ladies and gentlemen! Are you ready for the Spicy BBQ Hot Wings Challenge? The rules are simple. If you don't wanna clear your seat, you better handle the heat. You touch the milk, you're gone. Let's bring out the pain train to Flavortown. In three, two, one. Bring the pain. Oh, my God. That's Betty! Oh, my God. This is the train to pain. Who can handle the heat? Hold it together. Hang in there. Hang in there. Hang in there. Oh! You're gone. Go. Go. Go. Excuse me, Betty? You don't have to eat it all. It's okay. I'm hungry. I know her! "And it was then, on the hallowed turf of Gillette Stadium, that Gronk took her, and she knew this was the best a man could get." Thank you. Thank you so much. This is all so unexpected. Uh, if I'm not mistaken, Mrs. Ledoux, you are a multi-hyphenate. Aren't you the original Mayflower Girl? I love your book. Thank you. Well, that was-- that was a long time ago. Well, beauty has no expiration date. Dan O'Callahan. Oh, my God. That ring. Oh, my God. The fingernails. Football nails. You've got two rings. Yep. I have to assume you-- you played. I did. Two Super Bowls. Two different teams. So, do I just call you the Mayflower Girl? Patricia. Love your book. Thank you. Saved our marriage. Thanks. Wait a minute, not Virginia? Uh, Virginia Ledoux was the name of my poodle. Well, your poodle must have a real thing for football players. No. I do. Ladies and gentlemen, here we are at the pinnacle of pain, the temple of heat. Our final round, Dal versus Betty. Dal, how you feeling, bud? I'm feeling great, Guy-- All right. Great, Dal. And, Betty, everything okay? Yeah, I'm just getting ready. All right. Remember, embrace the spice. Lean into this. Don't fight it. It only makes it harder. Okay. You go big or you go home. Okay. All right. All right. For this final round, Satan's Tongue. The most difficult wing we have. And we're going on three, two, one. Bring the heat! Dal gets a nice portion. So does Betty. Dal with one-- Dal with one bite. Betty with two. Dal? Dal's not looking good. Dal's shaking. Betty has another bite. Dal spits. Dal's out! Give it up for our champ, Betty! Oh, well... Ladies and gentlemen, your champ, Betty! Betty, how'd you pull that off? - That one had a... - ...bit of a kick. A b-- Listen, it was amazing to watch you knock that out of the park. How did you do this? How do you handle spice at this level? I don't know. Unless it has extreme flavor, I can't taste anything anymore. Well, speaking of extreme flavor, I got some brisket you gotta try. Can I bring my friends? Absolutely! You're the champ! Give it up for champ Betty! Maura, would you like some more brisket? Oh, I could eat your brisket all day long, you brute. There you go. There you go. Mmm! Mmm! It's so good. Ah! Trish! Oh, hi. Trish! Are you Guy Fieri? Of course he is. Where have you been? I've been talking to a fan, and he invited us to a party. Look. A fan? A fan of my writing. Also a two-time Super Bowl champion. Trish. I didn't flirt. I mean, he did. Don't you think we should rest before the big game tomorrow? Wait. If it's that party, oh, you go-- It's gonna be off the hook. I'm going to that party. Yeah. I mean, he's right. Look, we're not playing. I thought the whole point of this trip was having an adventure together. This is an adventure. I'm there. Will there be dancing? If you're going, there'll be dancing. Oh, gosh. Betty? Yes? Betty, Betty, Betty. Let me just check your lips. Oh. You, who never wear lipstick. Uh-huh. Okay, good. Don't lick your lips. All right. Let me see your beauty mark. Very good. Come on. Let's go. Okay. Hot stuff. Are we gonna be the oldest people here? Betty, don't reinforce stereotypes. Oh, there's Dan. Dan! You have a fan named Dan? Yeah, Dan O'Callahan. Hey, come on up! I thought you said you've been working out. I have. How many leg days have you skipped? Look at those chicken legs. That's mean. He's got great legs. Oh, it's called "negging." It's how we flirt. Why would you focus on negative things? Can you let them up? - Oh, he's getting us in. - Sorry, ladies. You know, he used to play for the Pats. Sorry. It is so great to meet you all. Dan. You played for the Pats? I did. For three years. Wow. But I spent most of my time with the Raiders. Hmm. Okay. You look lovely. Thank you. Well, hey, I wanna introduce you to some of my friends. Come on inside. Where's Maura? Where's Maura? Oh, oh, oh. Come on, Maura. We gotta stick together. Christ's sake. Have you lost your mind? Excuse us. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's too bad. Bye. Thanks a lot. You are gentlemen. - I really appreciate it. - Come on. Where did Trish go? Wow. I have never been to a party like this. The only parties we go to are faculty parties where they just have cheap champagne. Last party I went to was a funeral. It was fun. I bet they've got tons of drugs here. Piles of cocaine. I bet they even have one of those Eyes Wide Shut sex rooms somewhere, don't you think? You know, I'm gonna head back to the hotel. I-- I need to relax. Here. Oh, thank you. Who are you? Oh, we met outside. Yes, this is-- Sophie. Sophie. Oh, this is Sophie. Yeah. What a lovely name. That's my granddaughter's name, Sophie. Mmm! Just a wonderful name. These are good. Very good. Well, careful. They're high dosage. What? High dosage? Yeah. Are they drugs? Yeah. You said you wanted to relax. Mmm. What-- Sophie! Say, Sophie! Lou, where are you going? I ate two of 'em. Two gummies. What'll happen if I had three? Your friend drugged us. Big deal. You used to smoke pot all the time. That was medicinal. All right. Okay. We did it. We took drugs. But let's just, you know, enjoy it. I'm going back to the hotel. I need my ticket. I've gotta get some sleep so I'm fresh for the game tomorrow, which is why we're here. Unless you two are so hungover you can't join me. Gimme the ticket. Oh, God. Wait. I left it at the hotel, didn't I? I took it off at the-- God, no, I didn't. I didn't. I took it off at the spicy wings contest. I-- I put it down on the-- You've lost the tickets? No, I was trying to pretend it wasn't spicy, and it was really, really spicy, and I-- We've got to find those tickets. We've got to go to the NFL Experience now. It's closed. Look. Listen. Now, just calm down. Everybody calm down. Guy said he was going to be at this party tonight. We just find Guy. I'm sure he knows where the strap-on thing is-- How do you expect to find one guy in a sea of thousands? Huh? Huh? There! There he is. There he is. Where? I don't see him. He went that way. I don't see him. Why are you jogging? I'm jogging because he's jogging. Girls? Guy? Maura? Where did Maura go? Well, I don't know. Where's Guy? I thought we were looking for him. Eyes Wide Shut. ♪ Oh, why is nobody dancing? Yeah ♪ ♪ Why is nobody getting down? ♪ We lost him. Lou, look! Look! Where? Where? We gotta find those tickets. Yes, but doesn't this music make you want to dance? No, we've gotta stay focused. Yes, but it's so... So good. Oh, yeah. Excuse me. I'm looking for someone. You here for the poker game? You want some Skittles? Are you okay? I think so. Have a seat. I'm Guy Fieri. Oh! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry I hit you. Let me see. Mmm. It's not bad. It's not bad. You just-- It's just I like to dance. I never get to dance. That gummy bear was a humdinger. Maybe you oughta slow down. Yeah. Maybe you oughta slow down too. This is pretty slow. At the hottest party in Houston, with the hottest people, I'm sitting here with someone's grandma. Chomping the gummy bears or whatever. I get it. Oh, I get it. I get it. It's the negative, you know, the neg-- I can do this. I can do this. Let me look at you. No. My God. You're, like, perfect. Stand up. Stand up. Turn around. Turn around. Oh. No. Turn, quick. Okay. Sit down. There must be something. Show me your teeth. What? Let me see your teeth. Come on. Show me. Oh, there it is. What? Look at that. Oh, my God. What? A snaggletooth. Oh, God, you could eat corn through a fence. Oh! Yep, yep. Yeah. Hi, honey. Well, hi back to you. So, I wanted you to know, I-I sent you two versions of the paper, A and B, and I want you to tell me which one to go with. Okay? No, I-I can't. I'm at a party with a bunch of kids. - I'm-- I'm 36. I'm a man. - Uh, what? You're working on it. I gotta go. Uh-- Uh, o-okay. Maura. Yeah? Hmm? Bet's to you, Maura. I've been playing? No, you've been killing it. Killing it. Come on, Gugu. She's got half the table on tilt. Every time she raises, she says she's gonna take us to Flavortown, and then she-- she nicknamed me "Brisket." You know what? I shouldn't be here. I should leave I don't belong here. No, no, no. You gotta stay. You got to. Yes. You are meant to be here. Sometimes fate puts you exactly where you supposed to be. It's your bet. Oh! Yeah, okay. Um... How much is this? - Forty. - Okay. I'll, uh-- I'll raise you $40. Oh, wow. Really? It's 40,000. Right. Right. Okay. I'll raise you $40,000. I'm already out. You are a shark, aren't you, Maura? No, no. My late husband loved gambling. And he would lose every single time. I would win all the time, so I would slip some of these chips under his stack so he could keep on playing. That's a real sweet story, but... Damn. ...flip 'em, Flavortown. Okay. Trip twos! Sorceress. - Come on. - Sorceress. Dark sorcery. Shut it, Brisket. Oh, shit. Any requests? Beastie Boys! Try "I Won't Dance" in the original key of C. Ma'am, we're not doing karaoke. My phone. Hello? Mom, did you call the hospital? No, not yet. Mom, you need to call. It's important. Where are you? Some Texas mansion. But you said you were in New Hampshire. I'm not. I'm in Houston for the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl? How did you afford that? - It's fine. - Don't worry about it. Wh-- What's going on? Why are you lying to me? Everything's fine. I had some tests done. They're calling me to go over them. They mailed me the results. And? I haven't opened them yet. What? Mom, open the letter. No. What? Why does it matter? What's another two days? This is something I always wanted to do. To go to the Super Bowl with my friends and see Tom Brady win. So, no, I'm not gonna open that envelope. Because what's inside could ruin this for everyone. Everyone. Where is-- I gotta go. No, Mom. Mom? Has anyone seen Guy Ferrari? Uh, he looks like a Flamin' Hot Cheeto. What is this place? Hi. I'll be right back. Lou, what's the matter? I got drugged by gummy bears. I should go. I should go. Maura and Betty are gone, and the tickets are missing. What? What happened to the tickets? Hot sauce. Betty? Maura? How high are you, Lou? Substantially. Oh, okay. What you thinkin', Maura? Wouldn't you like to know? Maura! Are you playing poker right now? Yeah. Give me a sec, okay? Yeah. I have a great hand. We've gotta go. No! The tickets are lost! I know. But if I win this hand, I can buy tickets. Fine. Go beat him. Go! - All right. - All right, listen. I know that we've been having all of these beautiful moments, and I feel very connected to you. All of the things. But now I'ma have to take all your money. Mmm. All in. Okay. Me too. - Oh. - Well... Sha-blam! Oh, no. Wait for the river. Quad queens? Yes! You did it! Yes! I'm dead. I'm totally dead. I'm totally dead. Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You know what? I think I'm gonna cash out. Okay. Great. What charity are you playing for? It's a charity poker event. Oh, my God. Charity. Right. Uh, Gugu? Mmm? What's your charity? Broadway Cares. Give all of my winnings to Broadway Cares. And I wanna thank everybody for letting me play with you. I had a fabulous time. Ugh. Charity poker. I wasn't gonna wear a retainer for 18 months. Right. Doctor Wong was right, and the teeth just went right back to where they started. Oh, gosh, that's terrible. Well, you gotta roll with the punches, you know. It's-- You don't understand how hard dating is these days. Oh, I can imagine. I can imagine. But let me just tell you this. Listen to me right now. If you wanna find love... ...you have to focus on the positive, not the negative. There's always negative things. Honestly, if you see someone you think is interesting, you look them right in the face, and you say... "I like the way you look." - Oh, no, not me! - You too? What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. That's the problem. It's 1:00 a.m. Does nobody care that we don't have the tickets? Lou, Lou, relax. Oh, relax. I should be relaxed and in bed right now, but I'm not because you're too busy gambling. And you care more about some guy you just met than you do your friends. And you should be more responsible, but clearly you don't give a damn. I give a damn. I give a damn. We'll find the tickets. When? Tomorrow's the game. Use that big brain of yours. I thought you were supposed to be the smart one. What's going on? No one knows how much this trip means to me. Well, that's just selfish. It means a lot to all of us. You know, I'm tired. We're gonna find the tickets tomorrow. We're gonna go to the hotel, get a good night's sleep, and wake up all fresh. Good morning from Houston, Texas. It's Super Bowl Sunday, February 5, 2017, the biggest stage in sports. Patriots. Falcons. Two storied franchises, two inevitable fates, one-- Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, my God, my head. We all g-- We have to get up. We have to find our tickets. I don't wanna get up. Oh. Oh, God. Why is champagne such a violent beverage? Shoot. Lou, I'm sorry. It's my fault as much as anybody's. Come on. The game doesn't start for a few hours. We'll get tickets. There's gotta be a scalper somewhere. All right. Let's meet back here in an hour in front of the stadium. We'll all split up. Okay. Hour. In an hour. In an hour. Do you-- Do you know where I could find a scalper? I don't think I can. Okay, okay, okay. Got it. Hey. Has anybody got tickets? Okay, sorry. Sorry. Shit. You a scalper? No. You a cop? No. How much for four tickets? Ten thousand. Ten thousand? Per ticket. I'll tell you what. I'm willing to go 100 per ticket. That's less than face value. 175. Move on. I gotta find a real buyer. Will 200 happen? No. You're not gonna accept 250 cash in hand? What is wrong with you? I'm offering 300. No. 450. No. 500 is my ceiling. It's my ceiling. 525. Come on. Get outta here. No. You know what? When you are stuck at halftime with those tickets, I'm gonna lowball the shit outta you, you son of a bitch. 550. If my bookie were listening, I would tell him to put me down for, like, five large... Whoa. ...that the Pats take it by 14. All right? But I don't have a bookie, so-- Right. Well, hey, you heard him, Mike. You heard that. We're gonna be right back. Stick around. You can't blow up Mike like that on the show. Excuse me. Hey. Yeah-- We know each other, right? God, you look very familiar. Well, I was the Mayflower Girl. That's it. Yeah, you were! Oh, my God! From the commercials when we were kids. Yeah, I know. ♪ Tires, parts And new cars too ♪ ♪ We got it all-- ♪ Are you gonna do the whole thing? I had a humongous thing for you when I was about ten. All right. Too much. Too much. Thank you. That's very kind. Thank you. Actually, I need your help. See, my friend won the tickets at your giveaway, and now we've lost them. Uh... I don't-- Your-- Your friend won the ticket giveaway? Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't-- '- Cause these guys won the tickets. - Yeah. They won the tickets? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. That's the Tom Brady Support Group. They support Tom Brady? No. They're all men named Tom Brady who formed a support group because they're never gonna live up to that name. Are they even Pats fans? They're conflicted about it, let's say. They seem reluctantly like they're supporting 'em. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They came. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hi, sweetie. Okay, I was trying not to bother you too much, but, uh, which one? What? I sent you an e-mail with two options. A or B? What are you talking about? My paper. Oh. Oh, I didn't read it. Are-- Are you close to a computer? Can you find a Kinko's? No. No, I-- I am not going to read it. Well, are you just hungry? No, for God's sakes, Mark. I'm not hungry. I'm at the Super Bowl with my friends. But this is really important. To you it is. To you. Not to me. Honestly, it's your paper with your name on it. You have to make the decisions. Mark, are you still there? Yeah. Listen. Honey, I-- I have made a lot of sacrifices over the years, and I'm not saying I wish I could change any of that. I'm just saying just because I can solve a problem does not mean I should have to. Okay. I love our life. I love our kids and our grandkids. I love you. I love you too. I'm sorry. Have a great time. Okay. Okay. Okay. Found it! I found it! I found it! I found it! What can I get for you? Oh, is-- is Guy here? Oh, damn. It's you. Hi. How are you? Good. How's your bowels? That's none of your business. Okay. I haven't seen Guy in a while. I think he might be in the office. Where's the office? Good luck. Mr. Fieri. Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri-- Oh, hi. Oh, God. Sorry. Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri? Mr. Fieri? Guy! Yeah? Oh, thank God. Thank God. Mr. Fieri, I'm sorry, I think you have my strap-on. Hang-- Hang on a second. Oh. Oh, thank God. Oh, Betty, it's you. I was expecting someone else. No. I think you have my strap-on. You know, I took off during the competition. Your fanny pack. Yes. Your fanny pack. Yes. It went this way. So you don't have any tickets to get into the actual game? No. No, the tickets are lost. Did you try the lost and found? No, no. Where is that? Okay. Um... I don't know, actually, where that is. Oh, G-- There's got to be some way. If you don't have the tickets, then you don't have a-- It's one of those moments where all the work that you put in has brought you to this moment. And it's okay to be behind, 'cause you gotta remind yourself that it's all gonna work out. No, Tom. I don't think it's going to work out. They're not going to let us in. Lou, whenever I'm down, I say to myself, "This is going to be an amazing comeback. When we come back from this, this is going to be a defining moment in my life." You have to shift your mind to think that way. It's empowering. Say it. This is going to work out. This is gonna work out. Come on, Lou. Like you mean it. This is going to work out. This is gonna work out! Lou! Lou! Oh, my God. I found them! I found them. We got the tickets! We got the tickets! We got the tickets. You got the tickets. I got 'em. Oh, my God! I got 'em! Oh, my God! Oh, we got to go in now. Isn't that great? Now. Come on. Let's go. Yeah, great. Oh, my God. Games, everybody. Everybody have a ticket? Everybody take their ticket. Come on. We've got our tickets. We've got our tickets. Oh, my God. This is it. We did it. We did do this. Next. Come on. Hi, welcome. Hi. Oh. Uh... - Are you guys all together? - This is-- These aren't-- These-- I'm sorry, these all aren't Super Bowl tickets, so-- Yes, those are our tickets. That's great, but they're not Super Bowl tickets. Chip, I got another one here. Comin'. - Hot one. - Let me see. Four. Yep, they're fake. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You see, ladies, the official tickets have a hologram that lights up under UV light. These do not. You've been scammed. Well, that's not possible. We won them in a contest. No, we didn't. Lou, tell 'em. I never won the contest. A whole bunch of Tom Brady wannabes did. How'd you get the tickets? I bought them online. I maxed out a credit card, and I sold my car to CarMax. Oh, Lou, why would you do that? I wanted to have one last unforgettable experience before it was too late. Hey, little ladies, I'm gonna need you to move aside. We gotta let other people through the gate. Well, you can start by letting us through. Oh, you're not getting in. Oh! Wha-- Oh. When you do a double, they get thick. I got you. Let's make a run. Whoa. No. Hey. Wait. Maura. No. Come on, ma'am. No, no. She-- Come on. Come on. I'm not hurting her. I am not hurting her. We know you're not. Don't touch me! She's coming at me. Come on. Okay. Fine, fine, fine. Lou, where are you going? Louella, talk to us. What is going on? Lou, look at me. What did you mean when you said "before it's too late"? I had some tests done, and the hospital's been trying to reach me. I think maybe something came up. Oh, Lou. What did they say? I don't know, I-- They sent me a letter, but I haven't opened it. Well, open it. No, what if it's come back? I-- I can't go through that again. Oh, Lou. You're not alone. We're here for you. Always. We're all here to support you. Isn't that what friendship is? I mean, that we face the unknown together, hand in hand? I wouldn't wanna go through it with anyone else. I really love you all. I guess maybe this Super Bowl was never meant to be. Oh, come on, Lou. If you did this to give us something to remember, honey, it worked. Big time. We will always remember this. Absolutely. This has been the best weekend of my whole life. I'm not kidding you. The very, very best. Well, except for the guilt I felt because I lost the tickets, which were fake. And so, in retrospect, I didn't have to feel that guilty. Did I? Oh, hell. There must be a sports bar around here somewhere. No, no. No, no, no, no. God. There's got to be a way into that stadium. Come on. We're not gonna give up. We've come too far. No, we are not gonna stand around this food court, crying like a bunch of babies. - Gugu. - Yeah. Goo-goo, gaga. No. Gugu! Hold on. Gugu. Hi. Hey. Come on. Come on. Maura. How are you, ladies? Y'all look fabulous. Thank you. I wanted to thank you properly for last night, but you ran out so fast. Y'all ran out. Your donation was so beautiful. Thank you. You're welcome. I was happy to do it. Are you, um... Are you going into the game? Of course. I choreographed the halftime show. Oh, you're-- You work with Lady Gaga? I do everything with that girl. Where you think she got her name from? I'm Gugu, she's Gaga. Oh, she's spectacular. She is. Do you think you could get us in? Uh, yeah, we don't have tickets. Come on, ladies. Follow me. Go, go, go. Come on. Hey, there. How are ya? Doin' all right. Hold on. Let me see your badges. No. No. They're with me. They're good. These are my dancers. They don't look like dancers. Well, that's ageist. Isn't it? I don't care how old they are. They just need badges like these dancers. - Holy shit. - Flexible. Well, uh, they're all my dancers. I mean... What? You want us to show you? Okay. Okay. Um... Y'all got this. Come on. Come on. Let's talk about this for a second. Okay. Um... So what are some dance moves you ladies know? The twist. Twist. - The jerk. - Sh-- Shimmy. Yeah, uh, step-touch. All right. So we'll do the step-touch, the twist, the shimmy, and then we'll end with some jazz hands. How's that? Oh, yeah. - Okay? - Yes. - One, two, three. - Break! All right. Let's do it. Y'all ready? A little freestyle here. And five, six, seven. ♪ It's my-- And I live here ♪ ♪ It's my house and I-- ♪ There you go. Oh! Oh! And... Freestyle, ladies. Freestyle, ladies. Come on down. Y'all did so good! Five, six, seven and hold! Damn, ladies. Those were some sick dance moves. I know you're not his dancers, but that was awesome. Go ahead. Extraordinary! We have to go to work. It's been lovely. Okay. Y'all better fluff up 'cause these ladies are about to take your gig. Come on, kids! Thank you. Let's go. Yo, how good were they? Amazing. Good lord. In three, two, one! Okay, where to? Um... Oh! Oh! Empty seats right there. Let's go up there. Yeah. All right. Super Bowl 51. Pats Nation, welcome to Super Bowl LI. Welcome. There's the kickoff and we are underway. It's Tom. It's Tom. Okay. Where? Do our job now. Let's do our job! I think this is the best sitting down has ever felt. Third and long. Tom Brady's in the-- - Oh, God! He's sacked. - God. What the hell was that? We are still scoreless in the first quarter. Who keeps texting you? Oh, it's-- it's Dan. Well, why-- why don't you answer him? I don't know. I'm ghosting him. You know, he keeps calling... ...but I know how this works out. He's-- He's gonna be charming, I'm gonna fall for it. It's gonna all move too fast, and then everything's gonna come crashing down. You realize ignoring him is just gonna make him want you more? I mean, look at you. Honestly, and who you are. You're always pushing forward and doing new things. Well... You're irresistible. You know, honestly, I don't want to be. I don't wanna be irresistible. I'd like five grandkids like you have. Guess it's a little late for that. Yeah, I guess so. I want a man I can sit next to and not have to talk. Well, you can have Mark. He's real good at that. Well, I'd take him, but he's too much in love with you. Look, that's us! Oh, my God! Yay, yay, yay! Tom Brady, we love you! Look down there. Let's hear it for our Super Bowl superfans! My goodness, I wish I had those hips. Not on me, not on my watch! ...never been so-- Sit down. Tom, spank me. Right here. Spank me here, Tom. Oh, no. Get, get-- Sit down. Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed. The Falcons have no business being in this contest. I mean, it's gonna be a bloodbath. Oh, come on! Get him! Get him! Damn it! Atlanta with the first touchdown of the game. Nice! Bryant, the extra point. 7-nothing to Atlanta. Hey! Let's go. Out of the seats. Now. Come on. Let's go, Golden Girls. Let's do this. Now, I don't know how you ladies got into this stadium, but I know how you're getting out. Chip. Oh, God. Trish? Dan. I saw you on the Jumbotron. You weren't answering my texts. I was-- I was very preoccupied. Dan O'Callahan? When you caught that 90-yard touchdown pass against the Oilers! Poetry. I mean, devastating for me as an Oilers fan but poetry. Thank you. Dan, he's kicking us out. What? Well, yeah. They don't have tickets. Well, they're in the box with me. See you, Chip. Ready? Wow. This is how people watch football? This is heaven. I know. It's called a skybox. I'm sorry I was angry with you for hooking up with him in that broom closet. I'm glad you did. We were just kissing. Come on. Let's see the view. Maybe this is heaven. Oh, look at this. You get such a great sense of the whole field from up here. You can see everything. Exactly. Hey. You see that box right across the way? - That's the coordinator's booth. - That's where they call the plays. Wait, you mean those guys are talking directly to Tom Brady? Mm-hmm. Oh, what a dream. Hey, grab a seat. Let me know if you need anything. Yeah. Dan, I'm sorry I didn't call you back. It's just-- Sometimes I have a tendency to go too quickly, you know? That's okay. I get it. There's no pressure. Let's spend some time together, see what happens. Hey, Mickey. Hey. Um, listen. Some people around here, they've been asking about you. Some are under the impression that you've been kidnapped, you know, so they questioned me for about three hours. Of course, I'm no snitch, you know that. Thank you. That's really nice, but I don't want anybody to worry. You can be a snitch. Go ahead. Okay. So, when are you coming back? Some of the residents around here, they've been, uh, been eyeing your room. You know, I've been trying to keep them away, but they're like vultures, you know? You know what, Mickey? Tell them they can have it. Does that mean you're leaving? I'm moving back to my house, but you can come over whenever you want. Oh. Yeah. Sure. Go Pats, huh? Go Pats! Second quarter, still 0-7, Falcons leading. And... ...that's not gonna do it. Hey, what do you think a box like this costs? 245,000. No. You wanna bet? Yeah. What kind of buffoon would spend all that money? Me. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. Well, thank you for having me. Well, I don't know who you are, but I'm glad you could make it. You're welcome. Ryan drops back, protection holds up. He lets it fly. End zone, touchdown, Austin Hooper. Falcons, now a two-touchdown lead. You stink! Yeah, you tell 'em. Hooper touchdown. Who the hell is this guy? Come on. Brady looks, throws. And it's picked! Oh! Intercepted by Robert Alford. It's officially an 82-yard pick-six for Rocky Alford. Touchdown. Oh, Tom, come on. - It's only halftime. - 21 to 3. Somebody better be saying something really inspiring in that locker room right now. I hope so. And we are underway here in the third quarter. - It just takes one play. - Sure. It just takes one play. One play and then you got momentum and then... To Coleman. End zone touchdown. 28-3. This one has been all Atlanta. Wow. That sucked. 28-3. What's happening? Well, it's just the third quarter. They could still come back. Well, I'm sorry for your loss, ladies. Well, thank you, but we have not lost yet. No. Do you know what the Patriots' chances of pulling this one out are? One percent? Close. They have a .7% chance of winning. I still think they can pull it out. Oh, hon, I wouldn't bet on it. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, we will have the official Lombardi Trophy presentation at the conclusion of this game. Pardon my language, but screw this. Are you leaving? I'm gonna do something about it. You can stay here if you want to, but this is not how my Super Bowl ends. Hey, hang on to this. We got a deal. What's up? Let's go. Let's go. What? Let's go. Come on. Lou? Five minutes to go in the third quarter, and we are down by... a lot. It's a lot. Yeah. It is not looking good, Pats Nation. No. We gotta find a way to get the ball in the end zone. We got no choice but to stay in our two-minute offense for the rest of the game. We got no time left. Hey! - Let's go cover two. - Cover two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Double on Julio. Watch the scene. Over Matt too. Let's go. Cover two. No, no. Go to cover one. Go to cover one. What are you doing? You can't be in here. Listen to me now. It frees McCourty to play the run, get some sort of creative blitz going here. You've got great linebackers. Use 'em, for God's sakes. Why are we in cover one? What? No. Cover two. What? - Yes! - Let's go! Tom? Hey, you can't touch that. What-- You wanna get to her, you gotta go through me. Leave them. They can stay. What else you got? Okay. Tom? Tom, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Tom? Up here. Tom, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Tom? Up here. Up here. Up here. I'm Louella. I'm your biggest fan. I don't know if this is the right time to talk. Sixteen years ago, I was in the middle of chemo, feeling like I was done, like I had nothing more in me. And then you came on the TV, fearless, determined, a skinny little rookie. Watching you play that season gave me something extra to look forward to. Each week, I found strength in that, and that strength got me through my treatments. But that was 16 years ago, and I've enjoyed every moment since. And I'm sure you enjoyed winning all those Super Bowls. But that was the past, and we can't live in the past. No matter how good or how bad it was. Right now we have this one moment, and you're down in this game, a lot. But you're Tom Brady. You have to come back. That's what you do best. And I love you because you are the best. And anyone who doesn't love you respects you because you fight and you never give up. So I'm not giving up either. I don't know what's ahead for me, but if you fight, I'll fight. Now go out there and win. Let's go! Let's fucking go! How was that? That was... Beautiful. All yours. Let's go, offense. Offense is up. Let's go. Come on. We got a Super Bowl to win. Hey! Hey, there's nine minutes left and they've got momentum. If they pull this off, it'll be the greatest comeback in NFL history. Oh, my God. Actually, in '93, the Bills came back from a much larger deficit, but who's talking statistics? Betty, what are you doing? Come on. All right. That just puts us two touchdowns and two two-point conversions away. And two-- Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Two touchdowns and two-- So that's doable. That's all they gotta do. That's all they gotta do. Oh, my God. We gotta play harder. Gotta play tougher. Harder, tougher everything. Ryan gets hit, and that's a fumble. New England recovers. Something has really gotten into the Patriots. We got the ball back. This is too stressful. Oh, God. Brady... connects with Amendola. Touchdown Patriots. 28-18. Amendola. Oh, my God. That was nice. He's got a skull like a baby bird's, but his hands are like Midas. Brady throws up two. Two-point conversion, here we go. It's a direct snap to James right through. Right through. He's in there! Oh, he's got it. Oh, my God. Give Tom an Oscar for that. I thought that was it. Oh, my God. 20-28. Someone must have said something inspiring to Brady, 'cause he is on fire. It's a one-score game. Matt up in the pocket. Now gonna cut it loose, looking for Julio. What a catch! He made a catch! Unbelievable! - Oh, they just sacked Matty Ice. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He can't kick it from there. Attaboy, Flowers. Come on. Two and a half minutes left. We gotta get down the field here, kid. Oh, God. Oh, God. I caught it. It's crazy. I swear to God. No way. Look at that. Watch. Look there. Yo. Edelman comes down with the football. They're saying it's a catch. It's a catch! It's a catch! - It's a catch! - That is the greatest catch... Oh, my freaking Lord. ...in NFL history. Off his leg. After review, the ruling on the field is confirmed. That's crazy. Passes it off to James White, who runs it into the end zone. And he's in there. He's in there. Oh, my God! We're within two! Two points away. Oh, my God, James White. You beauty. We need a two-point conversion. We only have a minute left. Miracles happen. They happen every day. Quick screen to Amendola and he's in. It's tied! It's tied! He tied it! He tied it! The ball crossed the line. He is in. Way to go. Let's go! Tom Brady! Oh, my God. Overtime for the first time in Super Bowl history. Oh, my God. Holy sh-- Oh, my God. We are going to overtime. Hey, would somebody get him his blood pressure cuff? Oh, my God. It's not over. It's not over. Stay focused. Gentlemen, we're about to begin an overtime period that will continue until a winner is determined. It is sudden death, unless the first team to possess kicks a field goal, in which case the other team will have an opportunity. This is heads. This is tails. New England gets to call the toss. Heads. They have called heads. It is heads. We'll take the ball. Yes! Yes! Yes! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Hear me. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Let's go score and win this thing, baby. Yeah. Here we go. Amendola with the catch. Tom Brady to Hogan. For 16 yards. Let's go, Hoge! Oh! Oh! A few more for good measure. I think I'm gonna throw up, and this is the best experience of my life. Pass to Edelman. Fifteen yards. Here we go. - Nice. - This is it, piece by piece. We're marching. Here's Bennett. Couldn't hold onto it. Come on, Tom. You've got this. Green 19! He's in! Patriots win the Super Bowl. The Pats win the Super Bowl. I cannot be-- Come here. Oh, my God. I love you, kid. They did it! You did it. No, we did it. We did it. We did it. Oh, it was worth every penny. Lou, how much did you spend on this? Mmm. A lot. I might be able to help with that. What do you mean? In the third quarter, I made a bet with that rich guy that the Pats would come back and win. How much did you win? A lot. But he didn't have enough cash on him, so the poor guy-- I just had to, uh... take this. Oh, my God. So you're the women that broke into the coaches' booth. I did. I'm the one. I should've known. Come with me. All of you. No, no. Don't take them. You're not going alone. You sure walk slow. Yeah. Walking with authority. I'm sorry. I know we shouldn't have done it. But someone had to do something. They were gonna lose. I can't believe we're doing this. What's gonna happen to us? - Oh, God. - I haven't been to jail since '67. Hey! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're Danny Amendola. Yeah. Danny Amendola, you have the highest catch percentage of anyone out there. You are reliable. Oh, that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me. What do you mean? I'm sure they say that to you all the time. Is this yours? Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. It's sweaty. Oh, yes, it's very sweaty. And does your head actually... I wanna shave you. Yeah. Gronk. Hi. Have you-- Have you read this book? I take it everywhere I go. You're so big. Thank you. Louella? Tom. I wanna thank you for what you did out there. Thank you so much. I should say the same to you. Oh, what a day. Can you believe it? No. Thanks for saying all that. I don't know how you did it, but your words meant the world to me. We were down. You knew just what I needed. You know, I play a game that I love, this game of football, and it's taught me so much. And people say all the time, "You inspire me," and... it's just a game. What you've been through, how tough you are, you inspire me. And your courage inspires me, so thank you. You're welcome. And I love that jersey. Wow. Could we do a jersey swap? This jersey for your jersey? Yeah. And it's all sweaty and everything? It's got a lot of sweat on it. All right. I can do it. Yes. That one is-- I've never had anything with the sequins like that. Where is my jersey? It was just right here. Well, you know, you can send it to me. I will. Of course. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will start this season with a new quarterback at the helm. Forty-three-year-old Tom Brady will try to turn around a franchise that hasn't even been to the post-season since 2007. At this point, I've learned to never doubt what Brady is capable of, but you have to imagine... Game's about to start. Hey, guys. Come on. The game is about to start. Okay. How's the guacamole? It's done. Let's see. No. More onion. Come on. More onion? Of course. I think you're doing just fine. Well, she's a woman who knows what she wants. Let's go. It's about to begin. We're coming. We're coming. Hurry. Before anyone else does, I wanna make a toast. To a new season, a new team, and to the woman who brought us all together. Wait a minute, where the heck is she? Mom, come on! We're all ready! I was in the garage, getting chips. - To our healthy quarterback. - Oh. All set here at Tampa Bay. Kickoff. Hurry up. There's the whistle. This is the kickoff, and we are underway. So when are you gonna retire? I don't like to use the word "retire." It sounds so final. I don't "retire." I just change careers. Often. Technically, I took a sabbatical many years ago, and I just never returned to work. I wasn't asking you girls. I was asking him. You know, I've thought a lot about retirement. But it'd be a shame to retire if you feel like you still got it. Join the club. Yeah. I'll drink to that. Hear! Hear! Me too. Look at this spot. Cheers. Tampa. Who knew?
