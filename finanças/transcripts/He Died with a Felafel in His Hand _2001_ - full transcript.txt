You're all fucking ruining it for me! ♪ California dreaming ♪ It slices a bit to the right, dude. [Milo] Fore! (golf club wooshes) (frog thuds) I knew this bloke once, right? And he used to masturbate so much that he grew very fond of his hand. So much so that he began to talk to it and he put a little face on it. And he called it Muriel. And after a while, Muriel began to talk back to him. - Fore! (frog thuds loudly) He'd get her all dolled up in make-up and specially made little clothes. And at night she'd go down and make intense, mad, passionate love to him. Anyway, one night about 3 a.m., he wakes up in a cold sweat. And he hears all this panting and moaning and groaning coming from the next-door neighbor's apartment. And he looks down at his hand. There's nothing there, it's gone. It's just this bloody stump. So he staggers out into the hallway and he sees that the next-door neighbor's door's wide open. So he pops his head in and what does he see? On the bed, his hand, Muriel, all dressed up to the nines, make-up on, going down on the next-door neighbour. It's a true story. Yeah, I heard tell once, dudes, that a guy has about 4,000 times in him before he's all used up. That's fucking bullshit! More like 40,000. In your dreams, stick man. Add it up! Two times a day, seven days a week, for what, I don't know, 40 years. Two times a day? Who the fuck gets to do it two times a fucking day? Me and Jess used to. Two times a day. Me and Jess used to do it five times a day. For 40 years? What about hangovers? What about Christmas Day? How the fuck are you gonna do it five times on Christmas Day while the family are sitting around carving up the turkey? Make up for it at night with the wife. Wife, what wife? You haven't had a wife in over six months. I haven't got a problem getting women. I've got this thing I can do that sends them gaga. How exactly do you mean gaga? Gaga, insane, berserk, talking in tongues, you know, gaga. What like some sort of secret weapon? Some kind of like weird sideways movement? Can't really say, Flip. But it's pretty special, though. It could be worth a lot of money. Let's just get this straight. You're 20-something years old. You have no job, no money, very few prospects. You haven't been seen in the vicinity of anything which even faintly resembles a member of the opposite sex in over six months. And yet, you sit here and tell us that you have some kind of special thing that makes the other side go gaga. Well if it makes them go so fucking gaga, then what the fuck are you doing here with us losers? Yeah, he's got a point there, Danster. Yeah well, I didn't say it fixed all the emotional stuff, did I? [Sammy] Did I hear someone mention emotional stuff? A writer? You're a writer? I'm a writer. I worked at Burger King for three years before getting this job. I've got an arts degree. If we get you a job that says you lick toilet bowls, then that's what you do, you lick toilet bowls. (scoffs) A writer. Jesus. You can't write. I can write. Philosophical insights. Direct experience with the mystery of being. Dusky whores. Russian transvestites. An unfinished thesis on the 10 most painful human emotions does not constitute writing. Got stuck on jealousy. If it points inwards, it means your heart's full. If it points outwards, it means your heart's empty. You'd better spin it round then. She might change her mind. She ran off with your best friend. She said I didn't let her breathe. She said she needed some space. You followed her every time she left the room. You sat outside the door when she went to the toilet. Is it my fault I worried I didn't have a reason to exist whenever she wasn't around? What about a muse? Enigmatic, mysterious, intelligent of spirit. All great writers have a muse. What about teletype paper? Excuse me? Kerouac wrote on the road on an entire roll of teletype paper. He reckoned the pages imposed an artificial structure on his stream of consciousness. I heard tell once, dude, you write a story for Penthouse, they pay you 25 G's, minimum. 25 grand? [Flip] Yeah minimum. It won't budge. That must mean something, mustn't it? Means you're getting fat. She said she needed to live a little. What does that mean, live a little? Lead melts at 335 degrees Centigrade. The last tram leaves the town hall at 11:05 p.m. (scoffs) That's so fucking true. (bell rings) (sighs) Shit. I have come about the room. (upbeat music) It's a tent. Bank clerk lives there. Half rent, saves money. Do you mind? It's not for rent. Name's Jabber, Jabber the Hut. Anya. I control the remote. Understand? Remote stays with me at all times. I do not believe in the watching of television. It is the opiate of the masses. I'll just pretend you never said that. I need to know if the fridge has ever had any meat in it. (golf club swooshes) (frog thuds) I am, how you say non-eater of meat. Vego. Vego. Fridge is cool. Nothing but poundcake, beer and fish fingers. What is this fish fingers? Rectangular. Fish. Fried. - Crunchy. - Good. The roof, on the other hand. Flip! [Milo] It's a beef patty. Been up there for years. - (door opens) - Stand back, people. We're going in! Taylor, do you think that's wise? I'm sure I saw something moving in there this morning. (sighs) You've got to watch out for the sneakers. When they're replaced by army boots, it's random sniper time. [Taylor] Fore! (golf club swooshes) (frog thuds loudly) Enigmatic, mysterious, intelligent of spirit. You're talking about the girl I intend to marry. One. All intelligence must be shared. Wasn't there an Anya in War and Peace? Two. Everyone's gotta give it their best shot. Chemistry, Danny. Can't beat chemistry. Three. There is to be no lying, cheating, or backstabbing. Maybe it's Dostoyevsky. Brothers Karamazov, I think. Guy who gets the first date gets a clear run. Loser runs around the house three times with his undies on his head. Did you see the sparks fly between us? It's a done deal, my son. Don't even go there. I thought you all hated vegetarians. [Danny] True love knows no boundaries, Sammy. And she's not adverse to the occasional fish finger. Basically, we're willing to make concessions. We agree? I'm not like you guys. I'm in it for the long haul. We can deal with that. [Milo] We'll work around it. It's a bonding thing. [Otis] Blokes gotta stick together. [Milo] All for one, one for all. [Otis] That sort of thing. Guys with hard-ons. The blood rushes from their brains to their dicks and they all become real stupid. (typewriter clacking) [Man] Mr. Kirkhope? Yes? I wonder if we might have a few moments of your time. Every month, $563 is supposed to be delivered to a certain post office box at the Brisbane GPO. (voice chatters on phone) For the last four months, this has not happened. (voice chatters on phone) Do any of you have any reason (voice chatters on phone) for this? You do know those things give you brain tumours, don't you? Um. (Clears throat) We seem to be going through a bit of a transitionary fiscal crisis at the moment. He means a recession. We're considering it the recession we had to have. I think we got ourselves a couple of smart-arses. Are any of you shitheads related to a copper or a pollie? Looks like we're in the clear. Damn good tea. It's chai from India. Biscuit? No thank you. We're expecting a big check at the end of the month. 25 G's from Penthouse magazine. What do you do? Pose for a fucking centrefold? No, I'm a writer. I write for Penthouse magazine. No kidding. You got a machine? [Danny] I've got an Underwood. Is that Mac or Windows? It's a typewriter. Don't sound like no fucking writer to me, mate. - Oh, well, Hunter S. Thompson used an Underwood. Kerouac, Hemingway used an Underwood. Stephen King? Stephen King wrote heaps of stuff on an Underwood. Are we gonna get our bond back? Did anyone say you could talk, dickstrap? Did anybody here say you could open your dirty, fucking, stinking little trap? If I get a tumour, funboy, I'm gonna hold you personally fucking responsible. Us again. One of the life forms here has raised a question about the bond. (voice chatters on phone) Yeah. Sure. Sure, no problem, can do. Four months' back rent. Two months' rent in advance. End of week. Otherwise. (air hisses) Comprehende? Do you think it's true about the brain tumour? Supposed to be. You can get headset, you know. Keep the phone in your pocket, talk into the mike. Well you'd look like a frigging receptionist! [Man] It's an earphone thing! (thuds) Penthouse magazine? (typewriter clacking) Enter me, enter me, she gasped. (typewriter dings) Enter me hard, enter me deep. I want you inside me. Yes, yes! Insert yourself, Rodney. I want you now, entering hard, entering deep, yes, now, oh. I entered her? He entered me? I wanted him inside me. What are we, cars, elevators, hotel rooms that guys can crawl inside of, eat, sleep and leave a big mess for someone else to clear up? It's for Penthouse magazine. I just don't think anyone should enter or get entered, that's all. What about the 25 grand? 15? You want the truth? (outside door closes) This way. Just put it on the right. [Danny] You sure you don't need any help? Maybe later, I think. There're all these words for a woman who doesn't want sex, frigid, uptight, cold, icy. But can you think of one word for a man who doesn't wanna have sex? Dead.

[Danny] No, you don't. Do you ever wonder if it's all a big con, Flip? [Flip] Eh? This. Everything. What if none of it really exists? What if it's like some big experiment, and we're like ants trapped in a giant Petri dish? What if there's a greater intelligence out there and it's creating everything purely as a way of stopping us going insane on them? What if nothing really exists until we sense it? My room doesn't exist 'til I walk into it. Front yard doesn't exist 'til I experience it. You don't exist. I don't exist? Well, you could be just a projection of my inner psyche materialised from my brain in order to keep me company. What about the cashmere sweater babes over the road with their swishy little skirts and all? Would they be from your inner psyche or mine? Probably yours, I reckon, Flip. Took off a while ago with some rugby types. Losers, man, forget them. No, we're connected, man. Once you have them by the moonlight, they never wanna go back. It would mean that when we close our eyes, everything disappears. And if we open them fast enough we might be able to catch the greater intelligence out and see there's actually nothing there. What if I kept mine open while you shut yours? No, you're just being stupid now, Flip. It doesn't work like that. There may be some sort of delay switch happening. Tomorrow is the shortest day of the year. In pagan times, it would be time for the king to be sacrificed and for the queen to select a new man to be her king. May I? Seems a bit rough on the poor old kings, doesn't it? It was a great honour. Their blood had to be poured into the ground to make the earth fertile again and the harvest plentiful. Makes you sort of thankful for crop rotation, doesn't it? The female fertility cycle is 28 days. The lunar moonth is 28 days. Month. No, moonth. The moonth is a lunar month, the same as a woman's fertility cycle. 13 moonths fit exactly into one year. At the end of the 13th moonth, the king must die. Oh well, I guess if it helps for the harvest. When the patriarchy took over, they abolished the 13th moonth to stop the killing of the kings. That's why they say 13 is the unlucky number. Why should 13 be the unlucky number? Just because some man didn't want to be bled to death. I get very pissed off about that. Men are bastards. I hear about your secret weapon. To make us go, how you say? Gaga? (Danny clears throat) Uh, will you excuse me for a moment? (typewriter clacking) I'm telling you, bud, if this deal comes together, it's just gonna be one long line of kneeling down, dick-sucking motherfuckers waiting for me to come along and give them a taste of the big fellow here. How're you gonna get the designs on, dude? I don't see how you're gonna do that. (coughs) Any fucker propeller head can do the designs, bud. Those lines and dots they've got can be changed into, like, ridges and bumps for added sensitivity. Fucking guy's gonna think he's fucking Tarzan. (chuckles) (bong hisses and gurgles) You got a name for it yet? We're gonna call him the woomera. Think about it. Go further, longer with the Woomera. (door thuds) I thought we said no fucking backstabbing! What man, what are you talking about? You told her! Told her what? Secret weapon, talking in tongues, gaga. We never! Whatever happened to all for one and one for all? Male bonding, remember? We was doing you a favour, man. We thought she'd be impressed. We thought she'd want a taste. (door slams) It's gonna be fucking huge, man. Guys are gonna be beating down my fucking door to buy condoms with Aboriginal tribal paintings on them. (footsteps approaching) (knocking on door) I'm not here. (door creaks) Excuse me. Do you wanna get married? (typewriter clacking) We get married. We live together. We sit and face the same direction. We stare at the same thing. We have conversation that lasts no longer than the commercial breaks on TV. And one day, we wake up. We look in the mirror and we wonder what happened to our lives. You sure that's what happens? There's no hope? Very little. Pages tend to impose an artificial structure on the stream of consciousness. They don't make teletype paper anymore. I've already looked. Show me your hand. You are deeply aware of your own sense of melodrama. You lack faith in yourself but expect faith in others. You project your insecurities onto everyone around you. You reject happiness as being shallow and superficial. You embrace postmodernism to avoid having an original thought. You criticise yourself because it places you above criticism. You desire what you hate and you hate what you desire. And you always have to kill what you love the most. You can see all that? Nothing is new anymore. Everything is rehashed. Do you think there's such a thing as human nature? Do you think I can invite some friend for a party? (sighs) Don't see why not. (thuds) (typewriter clacking) There once was a man who used to masturbate. (dings) So much. (jaunty music) (Danny whistling) (sighs) Fuck. John and Marjorie Lewis request the pleasure of the company of Daniel Kirkhope to celebrate the marriage of Jessica Kate and James Lindsay at the St Stephens Chapel. You know, there are nuances tenth time around that slip by you at first. I broke bread with these people, Sammy. Me and Matt swapped cooking tips. They obviously don't understand the religious significance of that act. I thought they understood me. I thought they sympathised with me. Bit selfish of them to side with their own flesh and blood, eh? [Danny] It's a fucking betrayal, is what it is. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Roses, Danny, roses. Candlelit dinner, glass of wine, bit of a spliff and boof! Boof. Boof. You old romantic, you. She wants to have a party with some of her friends. I said it would be cool. (whoops) You can't beat roses, Danny. Add them to the local all-you-can-eat salad bar and you've got yourself one deadly combination. You wanna get married? Can't, got to go out later. Good evening. I move in now, yes? Yes? I move in now? I'm sorry, the room is taken. Bond. Do we have a name? Yes. Your name, what is your name? Sam. Danny. Flip. Jabber the Hut. Oh, Star Wars Trilogy. Got it in one, Tiger Girl. You, yes? Hi, Satomi. Satomi. Where are we going to put her? What do you think? (typewriter clacking) They look different, they talk different, and know things we can't even begin to comprehend. If that's not a sign of an alien, I don't know what is. He your boyfriend? Do I look like a masochist? They come down here, they get impregnated with our seed, then they bugger off back to the Planet Beautiful, where only women are allowed to live. I wanna find that planet. Okay, Tiger Girl. [Danny] I want to live there. Either we come up the equivalent of Colombia's national debt in the next 24 hours, or seriously consider some kind of ritualised mass suicide.

Came up with some new ones I never even knew I had. Said all the right things, told all the right lies, but still, still not one drop of affection down south. You do realise Lenin wasn't actually his real name? It's a completely made-up name. Like Bono or Prince. You see this wallet? Apparently rocked up one morning and said, call me Lenin. $4,873 have passed through this wallet in the past 12 months. All of it in the sole pursuit of women. Pity he didn't hang around. He could have called himself, the political leader formerly known as Lenin. So you know what I did? I got up, caught a cab to the red-light district, walked into a brothel, pulled out a $100 bill and a very nice girl took me into her room and had sex with me just like that!

Commitment involves feelings, feelings involve emotions and emotions are a fascist construct forced upon us over thousands of years by the patriarchal hierarchy.

I wasn't allowed to say I love you because it sounded like a cliche. How do you climax without it sounding like a cliche? Do you reckon I should look at P for prostitute or E for escort?

How do you know my name? I'll tell you how this game works, Daniel. We're the cops. We get to ask the questions. You're the suspect. You get to complain about your civil liberties, perhaps get shot, maybe even killed. And it has to stay like that, Daniel. Otherwise, everything falls out of balance. And when things fall out of balance, you know what happens then, don't you, Daniel? Your spiritual values start to decline. You get your disintegration of your social structure, don't you? The system collapses. Pestilence, flood, famine. It happened to the Romans. It happened to the Greeks. It happened to the ancient Mesopotamians. And we don't want it happening to us, now do we, Daniel? What's this then, Daniel? Toilet paper? I'm a writer. Pages impose an artificial structure on my stream of consciousness. Well, I guess that would mean you'd write shit, then. Wouldn't it, Daniel? What's going on? We're the police, sweetheart. Your civil liberties are about to be violated. Oh great. If prostitution is the rental of the body, marriage is the sale. You're a sick fuck, aren't you, Daniel? What the fuck is wrong with you people? Haven't you got anything better to do, like chasing rapists or murderers or something? You know something about rapes and murders, do you, sweetheart? Fuck you. Sammy. We refuse to answer any questions without the presence of a solicitor. You know what we usually do to places like this, Daniel? We usually torch them. So that would make you the arson squad then? (laughs) You're a tough nut to crack, aren't you, hard case? You animals got any guns on the premises? Sure, we've got a cache of paramilitary weapons up in the attic. I'll just nip up and get them, shall? No, I reckon you're on something. What do you reckon, Stuart? Put it away, Russ. You lot on drugs? Only when we can get them. If you don't cooperate, hard case, you never know what might happen. Nice tatts, man. You look like a fucking pincushion down there, mate. Flip, what's going on? It's cool, dude. Nanna's booked me into rehab. (sighs) It's a good one. They get you to make your own bed and stuff. Let's stop the clowning around, hard case. Your friend here led us a merry chase last night through numerous brothels, two nightclubs, a girlie bar and the casino. Picked him up at the blackjack table, trying to order half a dozen Asian girls and a gramme of speed from the croupier. We cancelled the girls. Not before he whacked up over eight-grand's worth of whoopee on this, though, Danny boy. That's my card. It would seem so, Danny boy. Seems like you owe $7,257 in rent and damages to some of our friends in Brissy, Daniel. Add that to the eight large notched up by your associate here. Which means you're gonna need the mother of all student loans to pay that lot back, aren't you, Daniel? We refuse to say one more word until we have spoken to a lawyer. Now I've had just about enough of you I can take, arsewipe! Some of our friends own that casino, Daniel. And they don't like being out-of-pocket. Makes them angry. Makes us angry. I need to pee. Can you hear something, Stuart? Put it away, Russ. You know, like a mosquito buzzing, or something like that. Russ! Put it away! He needs to fucking pee, you fascist pig dog! (groans) (gun fires) (thuds) Shit. Big mistake, hard case. Big fucking mistake. (laboured breathing) Fight the power, Daniel! Fight the power, lain. (thunder rumbles) [Stuart] Pity it had to come to this, Daniel. And who was to know it was only a water pistol? [Danny] Excuse me? The gun. What gun? Your friend pulled a gun. We fired in self-defense. Who was to know it was only a toy? Are you insane? There was no gun. You look after yourself out there, Daniel. Anything could happen, you know. And let's face it mate, it probably will, won't it? (siren wailing) I'm not your mate. Maybe, maybe it was like, you know, a Buddhist thing. He denies your existence, don't call us, we'll call you, that sort of thing. It's the police, Sammy. They're hardly likely to be Buddhists. They shoot first, ask questions later down here. I'm a dead man. Maybe you're just losing weight. Inwards, your heart is full. Outwards, your heart is empty. I wasn't exactly expecting a shower of confetti. Maybe you should move on. It might not be too sensible for you to wait around for anything to happen. What about you? I think I'll, think I'll stick around here for a while. Sort of like it. (Taylor retches) (yells) Best fucking night I've had in ages. (typewriter clacking) Just what is your fucking problem, Nina? Nothing, Dirk. What is your fucking problem? I don't have a problem, Nina. I'm just making toast. Well, I'm just unpacking the shopping, Dirk. (typewriter clacking) ♪ All the leaves are ♪ ♪ All the leaves are brown ♪ ♪ And the sky is grey ♪ You're fucking insane.

What are you doing here? Heard you had a spare room. You really should ring your mum, you know. I think she misses you. Tuesdays and Thursdays, Danny puts out the rubbish. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Dirk cleans the bathroom and the kitchen. Saturdays and Wednesdays, new person, that's you, vacuums the house, including all the bedrooms. Taylor cooks when he's not on night shift, Uptight does it when he is. And everyone is banned from writing each other into their novels, plays, film scripts, websites and all future technologies. What about you, what do you do? (scoffs) I don't have to put up with this, you know. I do have an audition in the morning. Don't know what you see in her, she's not very attractive. Welcome to hell. [Sammy] At least it's warm. (typewriter clacking) (buzzing) Mr. Corcoran? Excuse me? I'm with the William Macey's high-purchase division. Just wondering if a Robert Corcoran lived here. Come on in. You're number five for the week. Forming a club here for people chasing Mr. Corcoran. And you are? Bragg, Billy Bragg. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Repo Man. Drawer of the living dead. All for Mr. Corcoran. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. Fake ID, phone account, broker a line of credit, stakes back to us, bingo. There is no Mr. Corcoran. Probably never was. If work calls, I've had a car accident. If uni calls, I'm in Melbourne on a research trip. If Mum calls, I'm gay and fucking my sister over at her place. And if Joey calls, I'm still using the computer so he can go and get fucked! You know, if you all watched just a few more daytime soaps, you'd understand a whole lot better what I have to go through every day of my life. The ups and downs, the highs and lows. How about a nice cup of tea? (door slams) (buzzing) (sighs) [Danny] Fuck! Your mother seems very nice. You really should speak to her a bit more often. Mr. Corcoran, I presume? Do stoevski. Italian name, is it? That old Corcoran sure does love to shop, don't he, Fyodor? And he ain't finished with us yet. Not by a long shot. He's got your Amex, your Visa, your MasterCard, Diners Club, hell, even your Grace Bros card's up there in the top five. You're too sensitive. You feel too much. Why do you always have to feel so much? Why do you always have to wear black? I'm in mourning for my life. This is Sydney, you know. They do things differently here. Nobody cares about my problems, do they? Nobody cares about how I was raped by my uncle when I was 14, or how my psycho ex-boyfriend slept with my arch-nemesis from drama school! Do you always have to flirt? You flirt with anything. You'd flirt with a rock if you could. I find it natural. [Sammy] Well, try to suppress it. I think you're being weird. Not as weird as you. When it comes to weird, I think you take the cake. I am not weird. Nice tea, Fyodor. It's Indian, I think. Biscuit? I don't want to talk anymore. I've had a cunt of a day. It's not cheap, you know. Bulimia's not cheap, you know? A real cunt of a day. Crime and Punishment and what was the other one? The Idiot. I'll keep an eye out for them, Fyodor. But I gotta tell you, you're never gonna be a successful writer with titles like that. This is Sydney, you've got to be more upbeat. Do you know what I mean? I want those creatures out of my house! (funky music) (women passionately moaning) (knocking on door) What? May I? We are not too loud for you, are we? You know, we're just having fun. How's the patriarchal hierarchy? How is, how you say? Your stream of unconsciousness? (sighs) You sure we're not too loud for you? Not a problem, knock yourself out. I had better go. (women squealing and laughing) Fuck. (glass shatters) [Anya] Look what you've done! [Danny] Jesus Christ! (knocking on door) I'm sorry, we broke the lamp. Look. I don't care if you break your skull and your fucking little brains come seeping out onto the carpet. I just wanna be left alone. I want to be going berserk. I want to be talking in tongues. I want to be gaga. [Danny] I'm sorry. What for? [Danny] It didn't mean anything. Spare me the cliches, Danny. I'm a parody of myself, remember? No-one can hurt me. I have no feelings, remember? Feelings are a fascist construct. No! I don't see why I should have to suffer just because you two were beaten as children and forced to eat dog food! She's a chaos freak, Danny. It's like the antimatter equivalent of a control freak. She needs to inject chaos into any given situation, doesn't care about the outcome. Just the trouble she causes for everyone. I am Bajorian, she's Cardassian. She bites, I bite too. What? It is from Star Trek. Cardassian and Bajorian. They are two life forms that try to be kind to each other, but they can't help their nature. Like the frog and the scorpion. You know this tale. It is Greek. Look at yourself. You're not even upset. You don't even know how to get upset. I just don't want to be in love with anyone right now. If you want to sleep with her, just sleep with her. I really don't give a shit anymore. I don't wanna sleep with her. Yeah, right! Don't touch me. Just don't. [Danny] Where are you going? You know, Danny, whatever happened to your moral code of mateship? Oh I reckon those rules were written more with football buddies in mind. One day, Danny, you're gonna wake up old and grey in a house full of dumb kids living off fish fingers, bucket bongs and social security. You're gonna wake up, and it's gonna hit you like a fist right in the middle of your stupid-looking face. You're gonna wonder whatever happened to your life. (techno music) Well I hope you're all extremely satisfied with yourselves. My boyfriend now thinks I'm gay. My mother thinks I've been in a car accident. My boss thinks I'm in Melbourne. And someone told my uni tutor he could go and get fucked. (typewriter clacking) What are you feeling right now? Desire. [Man on TV] Yes. She said we never talked anymore. She said I never reveal of myself. They are all very fit, aren't they? They are all very, very fit. Look at this crap! Look at all the fat, ugly whores that get on TV. Why can't I get on fucking TV? How can I reveal of myself? What is there to reveal? The little man behind the curtain pulling all the strings? Who wants to see that? I've been to drama school, you know. I am a bit of a babe, aren't I? That's who I am, Gail. That's what I am, right or wrong. I can't change that. Al Pacino. I love that man. My pathetic life consists of sitting around, waiting for imaginary acting jobs to materialise, eating myself stupid and throwing up in the middle of the night. Well, I'm sick of it, I tell you! I'm sick of it! I have something to declare. I'm gay. Do we have any lollies? I said I was gay. I'm gay. That's nice, Dirk. It is obvious, really. Always thought you were. I'd just like to say that I've got a problem with you all accepting my homosexuality without question. No wonder my suppressed heterosexual side is in a spin all the time! You all thought I was gay, even when I was fucking straight! Dirk, we think it's great, mate. What's so fucking great about being a poofter, Danny? Nothing Dirk, just finish the bathroom. That's just fucking typical, Daniel! I'd like to declare I've got a problem with that too. You want me to put on a fucking pink apron, Danny? You want me to put on the fucking pink washing-up gloves and lick the boots of the hetero-fascist sterility conspiracy thing? No fucking way, pal! I'm not some minty fucking queen, lick the boots of you hetero fucks! Oh, give the fag some hetero foot massage routine when he comes in. Bullshit! Gay men are dying, Danny. And you want me to clean the bath. Dirk, just forget it, mate. You don't mean that, do you, Danny? What you really mean is, all you filthy little arse bandits should be nailed to a tree. Isn't that so, Danny? (sighs) Dirk, this newly installed sophisticated gay radar of yours is picking up shit from the cosmos that just ain't fucking there. I've got my own shit to worry about. I've lived in 49 shared households in what seems as many years. I've been ripped off, raided, threatened, burnt out, shot at, cheated on, scabbed in every one of those years. My beds are foam slabs on the floor. My cupboards are stacks of stolen milk crates. I've lived with tent-dwelling bank clerks, albino moontanners, nitro suckers, psycho fucking drama queens, acid eaters, mushroom farmers, fucking brothel crawlers, fridge pissers, hard-core separatist lesbians, and obscurely tiger-throated Japanese girls! And now the best friend I've ever had in the fucking world won't even fucking talk to me! I'm in a psycho fucking nightmare from hell and I'm fucking fed up with it! So I suggest pal, that you tune in and chill fucking out. (thumps) Nobody asks me about my problems, do they? Nobody asks me about my loopy parents and their endless fucking divorce case. I've got to give evidence, you know. They've both subpoenaed me, you know. I didn't know. You didn't ask, did you? They're very, very fit. You have to admit they're very, very fit. Dirk's gay. I always thought he was. I baked some scones, if you want. It's a new recipe. (footsteps approaching) [Taylor] You okay in there, little buddy?

When they told me I'd have to make my own bed, I didn't know they meant make my own bed, you know? Like, out of twigs and shit. Shit. Mr. Dostoyevsky, I presume?

Or is it Bragg? Or maybe it just all adds up to one Robert J. Corcoran. Tea? Letters for the oppressed minority. That's not funny, Taylor. Gay men aren't dying, you know. What exactly does it mean, gay men? $7,257 on rent and damages to a house in Brisbane, $8,329 owing to a Melbourne casino, and $9,392 in credit card fraud. Leaves a grand total of $24,979.
