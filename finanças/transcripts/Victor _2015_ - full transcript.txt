I never thought I'd end up here when we moved from Puerto Rico to Brooklyn. It all started the night I joined the Roman Lords. You okay, hombre? Yeah, man, I'm cool. You goin' in or what? Wait here for the word. How's your boy? He's down. Looks like he's about to wet his pants any second now. No, man, I'm cool. You ready to die? Well, uh, let's jump these guys! That's the right attitude, kid. Let's rumble! Woo! Yeah, get 'em! Are you okay? Come on. Just wait here, okay? Wait here. Sherry! Hey, man, what are you doin'? Who do you think you are, huh? I'm a Roman Lord. We gotta jet, we gotta jet, guys! We gotta go. Victor, come on, we gotta jet! Come on! Did you see their faces? I can't believe you were ready to take on Danny. Who's Danny? He's their leader, man. The leader of the Liberty Boys. Man, it all happened so fast. Unbelievable, man. First rumble. Thanks. See you tomorrow? Where you goin'? Home, my ma is probably wait... Mom? You're a Roman Lord now. We have to go celebrate our victory. Come on. Come on! Hey-hey! Hey, man. Ah! There he is. You down, hombre? - Huh? - No, man. Hey, what about you, kid? It will give you wings. Make all the pain go away. I can take the pain on my own. - Ooh... - Hey. Razor, what if we get jumped, huh? You gonna have my back all zombied out like that? Hey, he'll come flyin' in to save you. Try and save yourselves, huh? Ease up, little brother of mine. You know your big bro knows what he's doin'. Not bad for your first bop, kid. Nice. Come here. Are you down, kid? Yeah. I'm down. Thicker than blood, Victor. Once a Roman Lord, always a Roman Lord, huh? - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - That's right! - That's right! - Yeah! - That's right. - Yeah. - Yeah! - Woo! Victor? Hi. Ma. You're still up. I can't sleep until you're home. You know that. Looks like Pa had no trouble. Hijito,he was barely home five minutes. Leave it on. I like it. Okay. It was keeping me company while I waited. No food? It broke. But your father will fix it in the morning. No. I'll fix it. It looks like somebody tried to fix you. What happened? Nothing, Ma. A little disagreement. You got a new jacket. Yeah, Ma. Just makin' friends like you told me to. We need all the friends we can get here, right? It's okay. I'll go check out Ricky. You go to bed, okay? Goodnight, Pa. Hi. Where have you been? Where have I been? Nowhere. Me and my buddy here. The two heroes have fought bravely, and the bad guys are defeated. We even saved a beautiful girl. Hey, go to sleep. Sweet dreams, hermanito. Ay, Manuel! Manuel, a rat! A rat, really, it's right there! Get it! Ricky, get out, get out. Get another chair. It's over there! Get it... be careful! No, no, stop it, that's enough. Keep it down in there. What'd you say, huh? Victor, mira... no! Stop it or I'm callin' the police. You're not callin' anyone, you hear? Get inside, get inside! Victor! When are we gettin' out of this hole? Victor, respeto,respect. You have the same question, Ma. - Calm down. - What else needs to happen? - Shh, shh, shh. - Huh? Vic, you never do that again, you understand? You brought us all here for a better life, huh? Where is it? I didn't have to work before we came to the new land. I miss the beach. Don't worry, papi, there's a beach nearby, okay? But we never go. We're gonna go. We're gonna go. - I got it. - No, no, no, no, no. - Come on, I got it. - I got it. No. Mr. Pavel. Is everything okay? Uh, yes, everything is fine. What is this? No, no, no, let me. I've been very patient, Mr. Torres. - I know, sir, I know. - But you're two months behind now. I'm gonna take care of it. I'm very sorry. Thank you very much. So we'll get to move after all, huh? Why haven't you paid him? I lost my job a month ago. I'm looking every day, and I'm gonna get something. Victor, why don't you take Ricky to the park? Okay? Come here, little man. Let's go get dressed. Aw, almost. A little young to be a Roman Lord. I hope he'll never have to be one. I'm Victor. What's your name? Sherry. Sherry... Like the fancy drink. Yeah. I shouldn't be talkin' to you. But you can't resist me. Probably could. You from Puerto Rico? Yeah. You know, you hurt a lot of my friends the other night. They aren't your friends. Oh, says who? If your friends meant so much, I wouldn't be worth talking to. And you think that you could be a better friend? Look, what you did for me the other night, it was nice. But I doubt you and Danny are so different. Just the same guy in a different jacket. Hey Sherry. Hey Sherry, wait. "Sherry, wait!" "Sherry!" Hey there, new. There you are. Still got us the machine shop, right? I'm with my brother, man. Bring 'em. All right? Clear all this out. You gotta keep 'em pointed up before you're ready to shoot so you don't, uh... drop a bullet. Yeah, I dig that. Hey, you worried about somethin'? No, man. My brother's outside. Don't worry, Vic. Gotta bring him up under our protection. I'll go check on him. New Life. What kind of place is that? It's actually gonna be New Life Church. It doesn't look like a church. It was a bar, but we're turning it into a neighborhood church for everyone. Can you do that? I think so. You know, some first century churches met in caves. Really? I'm Jimmy. My name's Ricky. Ricky. I'm just waiting for my brother in the machine shop. They're doin' somethin' I'm not allowed to see. Looks like maybe they're, uh, done. Come on, Ricky. I'm Jimmy. It's nice to meet you boys. Hey, I'm Larry. Hi Larry. This is, uh, Curly, and Moe. I see. That's not their real names. Hey, let's go, Ricky. Come on. Hey, we are startin' a church. You should stop by. Really? Yeah. You're a pastor, man? Don't seem like you're from around here. Well, is anyone from around here originally? Ha. One point for the pastor. What, you comin' in as the great hope of this neighborhood? I don't... I don't think that at all. I really don't, but... I do believe in hope, and it's definitely not found in me. Oh, thank you, thank you. Well, um... good luck with that. Thanks, Vic, it's good to meet you. How do you know my name? It's on your shirt. Oh, man, that is two points for the pastor. Shut up. Come on, Ricky. Every once in a while, some cat messes it up and they, uh... blow their lid. That right, little brother? Whoa! Are those real guns? Just for fun, okay, buddy? Have you named 'em? Yeah, kid. We'll call 'em Tom and Jerry. Perfect. Come on, Ricky, let's get out of here. You hombres clear your tracks. I just want some tea. Let me help. You shouldn't have to worry about this. Why not? Because you're a boy. I'm not a boy. And I have a job... which is more than Pa has. Don't talk like that, Victor. You would break your father's heart if he heard you. He's breaking your heart, Mama. Is this the life you've dreamed of? No... No. But your father is trying. He's a proud man. I'm not gonna deny that. But he's out there doing whatever he has to do. Your father will find a job. Okay? You go out. Go be with your friends. Go meet a girl. Hm? Be a young man. Okay. Gracias. I'm about to put y'all up in the screen. Y'all gonna be in the movie. That zombie would never catch me, man. So hey. You catch for corrupting your little brother the other day? No, man, it's cool. You got lucky. Puerto Ricans don't need luck. You sure he's not gonna run his mouth off and tell your mom about the guns? No, my parents are too focused on payin' the bills. - Aren't they all, man? - Mm. No problem, kids. We just need to make a Rockaway withdrawal. What? Posh house over on Rockaway. Squares comin' there all the time beggin' to get jumped. Yeah, but that's Liberty turf. Mm, no, they don't own that street. Dragons, Viceroys, Bishops. Haven't seen rob guys in broad daylight, though. - Hi Ma. - Hi, mi amor. Did you have some fun tonight? Yeah. Mm? Good. No music? It's only for a little while. Wait, what? Your father's at the pawn shop. - Now? - Mm-hm. Where are you going? Hey! No! Pa! Who were they? Hey. Who were they? I don't know. Doesn't matter. No, no, no, no. Hey, look at me. It matters, Pa. Stand up for yourself. Hey Vic. Good morning, sir. Sir, I was thinkin' maybe I could get some more hours. Seems you've been workin' some extra hours already. - I can explain that. - You think I don't know what those are for? Can't believe you were canned for doing some arts and crafts. Shut up, man. - All right. - Clear? All clear. Come on, man, it was a loser job anyway. Besides, Mike and I have a way for you to make some serious cash. Yeah, Vic, you need some money? We can introduce you to people that could help. Unless you'd rather steal than deal. I never said that. Vic, stay away from that junk. Hey, stay out of it. Why don't you punks deal? My man Sanchez is crazy. Doesn't want customers to run for him. No mixin' business with pleasure. How much money we talkin' about? These are fake. You had a bad score. Man... just take me to Sanchez and I'll make my case. No way. How are you gonna sell something you never even tried? You got no product. - Okay. - You don't have to do this. Don't be selfish, man. He's just trying to help his family. And we're just helpin' him, you know, take a ride to freedom. Hey. Just once. And then we'll take you to Sanchez. That's cute. I always have it with me. For good luck. Aw, wake up, Victor. Victor, wake up. I got you a job interview. You gotta look presentable. Come on. - Scott, this is the guy. - Victor. - He's in... he's in, right? - Go ahead. Hey, man, thank you, man. Hey Sanchez, this is the guy I was talkin' about, Victor. Ladies. Give me some space. Don't go too far. So... Pablo says you want a job. Yeah, that's right. Little lazy Nuyorican runnin' dope for me, huh? Wearin' a jacket? That means what? You're a tough guy? I ain't lazy. He's not lazy, sir. Roman Lords can speak to that. Roman Lords. You zombie junkies in your... In your little clubs. You think that means anything here? Huh? Now it's pretty simple how this works. You get the dope from me. You sell the dope. I give you your cut. I take the rest. You dig? Yeah, I dig it. Good. The beauty is that this junk sells itself. You think you can handle that? That's why I'm here. Mm. Come here. Come here. You're not a junkie, are you? - He's clean, Sanchez. - Shut up. You tryin' to... you tryin' to get my stuff wholesale? No. Nah, man, I'm clean. If you're not, I'll know. Okay. This one here is gonna be your biggest customer. - Tony! - Yeah? - Set him up. - Right. All right, man. All right, thanks, man. I know, I'm sorry. But I, uh, I got some extra hours. Hours that keep you out all night, huh? No, it was late so I crashed at Matteo's place, okay? I should have let you know, Ma. Yes, you should have, because I was up all night worried sick about you. Twenty bucks. Did you steal this money? Hm? No. I worked for it. Well, I'm just glad that you're okay. I was so worried. I'm tired. You look exhausted. Ah, I should rest. Go lay down. Thank you. Hi Jimmy! - Hey Ricky. - I know him. Can I help you with those? Okay, sure. Thank you. Jimmy's the pastor of the New Life Bar. Somethin' like that. We converted the old bar on the corner into a church and they're callin' it New Life. Ah, I see. - Yeah. - Come on. It's based on Corinthians 5:17. I like it because it gets people asking questions. You go to church? We went to church back in Puerto Rico. Why are you in this neighborhood building a church in a bar? Hm. It's a very long story, but... basically I grew up in a neighborhood just like this and was the furthest thing from a pastor. Ah. So they don't want you back home, huh? How's Victor? You know Victor? Well, I've seen him around. I hope he's okay. I hope so too. Ma. What's happening here? Look. We got a new refrigerator. And... Pavel fixed the stove. And look what I got, look at this. Look at this. No, no, no, no, no. Stop. Victor, Victor! Oye! How did you do all this? Where did you get this money? From my job. Look, it's your old one. Look at it. Mine was not this nice. - Can we get some ice cream? - No. Of course, buddy. For your birthday maybe. Go to your room. Victor's making a lot of money at this machine shop. More than most grown men make in two years. The land of opportunity. But what kind of opportunity? He's a smart boy, okay? He's not gonna do something... He bought a motorcycle, Manuel. Really? He bought a motorcycle. He's out till all hours of the night. He comes home with bruises on his face. What kind of business is that? Huh? The kind that gets you a record player. You know, he talks about putting money down on an apartment. I don't want a new apartment, and I don't want a record player if it means losing my son. Can you talk to him? I talked to him, okay? He's... He doesn't listen to me anymore. Coming here... I didn't know it was gonna be so hard. Is that why you think you need this? Hm? A pastor gave that to me in the street. Well, we're fine, Lila, on our own, okay? We don't need this. Hey. Hi. Why don't you fine ladies all gather together? Smile. Here you go. Wanna go for a ride? No. You hop on, we can make it to the 3:30 showing of West Side Story. New York Theater Uptown. No way. Yes. Listen to your friends. Come on. Not gonna ask twice. Go! I had no idea Natalie Wood could sing like that. I don't think that's her singing. Do you think it's fake? Nah. No way. Everything is true in the movies. I had no idea she was Puerto Rican. Well, I loved it either way. Thank you for taking me. I was gonna see it anyway. Yeah, right. What? Huh? Puerto Rican gang... on the big screen... singin' and dancin', huh? Oh, what's this? The tough guy dances. Where'd you learn that? Back home, I loved all the American movies. I saw Singin' in the Rain like a hundred times. So you wanna be Gene Kelly when you grow up? I am grown up. Oh, is that right? For sure. Hey, come up here. I'm not climbing that tree. The view's better from up here. I can't be your girl, you know that. Okay. So you can't be my girl. But you could just happen to come to a party with me on Saturday. With your friends? I can't. Don't you wanna see us singin' and dancin'? Stop it, you know I can't. There won't be any trouble. Just a good time. Fourth of July came early this year! Yeah, that's my little brother! Have you seen Sherry? Are you high, man? Pfft. I got it under control. Whoa, look out! Whoa! First Fourth of July of the Roman Lords, huh? Oh. I know who that is. Who are the debs, Vicky? You gonna introduce me to your girl? She's not my girl. She wants that to be very clear. Inside. Good evenin'. Ladies, gentlemen. Victor. Evenin', Pastor. You're up late. Workin' on somethin' new. That... Good evenin'. Service is at 10:00 a.m. in case you're still up. Come on. Dear Lord, we trust in Your Word. Shine Your light on our streets and in our lives. We believe there is no fear in love. Our freedom is found in You. - Amen. - Amen. Pastor Jimmy. Mrs. Torres. I wanted to talk to you about Victor. - Sure, please have a seat. - Thank you. I... Thank you. I, uh... The other day you said that you hoped Victor was okay. Well, he didn't come home until almost morning again. I did see him last night, um, out on the street with some friends and a girl, actually. I don't presume to know everything, you know, but I did grow up in a similar scene in Brownsville. I see a lot of kids who are lost and angry. You know, they don't trust authority so they're turnin' to crime, violence... drugs. I've been afraid to talk to him because... I don't want to know the truth. I'm so worried about him. I don't know what to do, I just feel so overwhelmed. I... I don't know what to say to him. I understand. My older brother was in a gang and I felt trapped. Helpless. You know, when I came to faith, I was encouraged to learn that when Christ was overwhelmed by darkness, He cried out to His heavenly father. He prayed. And that's one thing we can do, a place to start. Ask him to make Victor the man he was meant to be. Vicky! Victor! The sky's the limit. Anything you want, Ricky, okay? I'll have an egg cream. I don't like eggs. Funny, my little friend. No cream and no eggs, just the tastiest secret combination of chocolate, soda, and milk in the hands of a master. Here you go. Let's take a picture, come on. - See that? - Yeah. He's got a gun! We can take this outside. I'm callin' the shots. Let my brother go, man. It's okay, Ricky. Go home and wait, okay? Hey, hey, turn on some Tom and Jerry,okay? Okay? Ricky? Tom and Jerry,buddy. Let me know how they're doin'. Okay! You been spendin' some time with Sherry? Sherry? No, man. I don't know what you're talking about. You knew that Sherry was my girl. I didn't know, man, okay? Well, this is payback. Victor needs help, he needs Tom and Jerry. Hey, get outta here, kid. What's up, niñito? They're gonna shoot Victor at the soda shop! You boys get outta here or I'll call the police. We're not done talkin' to Victor. Leave him alone. You leave Sherry alone. All right? You don't talk to her, you don't look at her, and you never, ever sell to her. All right? - Did you hear me? - Yeah. I heard you. Good. Victor! Victor, are you all right? Ricky, go home and wait, okay? Let's go, come on! Hey! - Who we got, who we got? - Danny has a shotgun and two Liberty Boys are with him. There's probably more comin'. Hey! Okay, here, gimme your gun. Gimme your gun, I got an idea. Watch this. Oh, Danny, is that you, man? Huh? What, you can't just handle just you and me? Razor! No! Open your eyes, open your eyes. Oh. Stop! This doesn't involve you. Back off, boys. Nothing good can come here. Back off, boys. Come on, man, let's get outta here, come on! - Danny. - Let's go! - I'm not leavin' him! - Come on, man, let's go! Take the gun, I'm not leavin' him! Come on, let's go! - Let's go! - Come on. Matteo. Dear God. Are you crazy? Victor! Victor, are you crazy? What are you doing? That could have been you! It should have been me, Ma. - It was me they wanted. - Why, Victor? Over drug money? No. - Over a girl. - I want you to stop lying to me! No more pretending that this job of yours is normal. You are to tell me everything, do you understand? Or you will not leave this house. You can't keep me here. I want you to tell me the truth. No you don't. You want warm tea and I got it for you, didn't I? Is Victor okay, Mama? I don't know, Ricky. I don't know. Where are they? Chickens couldn't hold Matteo too long, couldn't prove anything. They let Danny go on self-defense. Where'd they take Razor? You. I'm sorry, man. How's, uh, Razor? Razor's dead! He's dead! It shoulda been you. - I know, man, I... - You brought this on us. You steal Danny's girl and hop her up too like everyone else you meet. So you can make more money. So what? I guess I'm leader now. First order of business, you're out! - Matteo... - Don't you dare come around here again. Matteo, man. You're done, man. You wanna know what it feels like, Victor? Huh? Go see Razor now. All right. Fix me, man. Victor. Where were you? Huh? What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? Victor! Sit down. Sit down! Are you okay? What's the matter? Papi? What's the matter with you? Did you take something? Did you take something? Yes you did. What's the matter with... Oh no, no, no, no! No, not this! No! Manuel! No! Oh no, no. This ends now. You boys are lucky to be here, to be alive. Uh, some of you are here because you wanna be and many of you are here because your families checked you in, but either way you got here, you found the right place. So the medical treatment we utilize here is designed to ease your symptoms of withdrawal as your body learns to function without heroin. And you'll be placed on a strict regimen of methadone as well as psychological study and evaluation during your stay here. And after our 21 days here together, you will be cured. Okay. This stuff works? Well, it's not the real thing but it helps get you through the night. I'm Bobby. Victor. That's Sal. What's up, man? And this is Randy. Stick with Bobby, man. He'll show you the ropes around here. Where are you from? Brooklyn. Brownsville. Oh man. What, down there with Sanchez? Yeah, he's one of the worst of 'em. He's pushin' flea powder. What... what do you mean? They cut the dope. With baking soda and starch, man. You want that real stuff, you go to Tompkins Square Park, none of that crap those paperboys are mixin' up. Ice cream. Right, now, stack the blocks to look like where you live. That's good. Now, how does that shape make you feel? Here. You go to panic down in Brooklyn? Nah, I've heard stories though. Yeah. Well, you will. Everything dries up. Cops rule the street for a beat, it gets ugly. Look, the panic strikes, you hit a stocked pharmacy. All right? That'll get you through. You get morphine, hydrocodone, all right? Now that gets you through the night. If you mix it right, that'll mess you up real good, man. What if you mix it wrong? Don't. Bobby, let me see the blue. Man, I can't wait to get outta here. Get that first fix. What do you mean? That first fix, man. You remember what that felt like? Yeah. So you come here when you can't get that good high anymore. You get straight, you go right back out. Feels like the first time all over again. Plus, you get to make crazy art. You need clinical help, man. What? I need a gallery, dude. Look at this. No. So, you all cured? I don't know, man. Just hopin' I can go back to a normal life. What, you think you gonna go back to school? Have a cute girlfriend, get a good job? We ain't normal, Vic. Man, we're the scum of the earth. Hey. Here's a little more artwork for ya. Christmas present. We missed you, Victor. I missed you too, Ma. Was it good to sleep in your own bed? Yeah. Yeah. You look good. Right? He looks healthy. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It worked, I think. - Yeah, I hope, well... Yeah, I feel good. - That's good. - Well... it's good to have you back, papa. Yeah. Well, look who's back. Little Vicky. You allowed to talk to me now? Or does your new leader forbid it? I talk to whoever I want to. How was dope jail? Educational. You ever been to Tompkins Square Park? Mrs. Torres? Mrs. Torres? Oh, hi, Pastor. - This is my husband, Manuel. - Just the person. I hear that you're a handyman. - Oh, you did? - Yes. We're fixin' up an old house a few blocks away for an outreach ministry. I'd pay you for your time of course. Ay, sí, Manuel. Uh... I could stop by sometime. Great, maybe after school hours so you can bring Victor. He's been back a few weeks, right? I haven't seen him but there's someone I'd love for him to meet. Victor okay? I can't believe you sold my bike. It was gonna get stolen anyway, man. Boys. What's that traitor doin' here? Hey. Bringing the Roman Lords to a new level, man. What's this? Map to the promised land. Victor scored it in rehab. I'll decide for myself. Well, we gotta figure out how we're gonna get cash. Stuff's pricier than that Sanchez junk. Rockaway withdrawal. How do you open this thing? Hey, money! Really, man? All this stuff and you want that? This is from a bike. So, man with the map... lead us to the party. - Victor! - Hey, boy! Happy birthday, buddy! - You're late. - I know, I'm sorry. I got tied up. Look. - Thanks, hermano! - Oh, you got it. What else did you get, huh? Mrs. Vera got me a yo-yo. Wow! Nice, very nice. Way to go, Mrs. Vera, way to go. Well, um, we got him cake or what? We have ice cream and we've been waiting for you. Well, let's eat it up. It's a party here, right? Does everybody have a spoon? Dejalo. Who doesn't have a spoon? - Tu! - Okay. You can have mine. - Ricky, you can use the fork. - Ricky, where are you going? Be right back! It's tasty, right? Got one. - Victor, what are you doing? - Hey, hey! What is this? Huh? Hey! What is this? Outside. I wanna talk to you right now. It's okay. Eat your ice cream. What is this? I'm sorry, okay? You've been doing this in your room in front of your brother? No, not in front of him. - Excuse me. - Bye! I thought at the methadone clinic, didn't we? Pa, that place, it was just a substitute. All right, Vic, you tell me how we help you, huh? - How do we help you? - You can't help me. You can't fix this. I can do it on my own, okay? - Just... not here. - Okay, where? - Tell me where! - Somewhere else! Somewhere else, I know I can beat it on my own if I was just somewhere else. You're going to that hospital upstate. I don't want any drugs. It's just turning a dollar bill into four quarters. What do you want? Cold turkey. Lock me up in a room and I can do it. Alone. Okay. You can have the solitary room on the fourth floor. But I have to tell you that abrupt withdrawal from opiate addiction is very, very difficult. I can do this, doc. I promise you, I have the will now. For once you were full of darkness but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light. That's Ephesians 5:8. Um... today I want you to meet a friend of mine who is from Kingsborough on an amazing journey from darkness to light. I asked him here today to share his story with you. Derek. Thanks, Pastor Jimmy. I don't talk fancy in front of people so bear with me. I feel nervous, like I'm hiding smack in my underpants at a police station or something. I, uh... I started out in gangs and then I got into drugs and then I started dealing and stealing to support my habit. I met Pastor Jimmy by Betsy Head and one day he told me to start praying. I thought he was crazy. - Sorry. - No, all is forgiven. I met Derek when I was working for Jimmy. But I tried everything else so I figured no harm in giving God a try too. Nothin' else had worked. Why won't you tell me what happened? - Hm? - Doesn't matter. Are you high? - Victor? - Not enough, Ma. Doctor gave me a methadone hit before I left. I wasn't fit to travel. I've been praying for you, Victor. Yeah? And I spoke to Pastor Jimmy. - He has started... - Pull over here. - Why? - I'm sorry, Ma. What... what are you doing? What are you doing? Don't pray for me, Ma. I'm not worth it. Victor! Victor! Victor Torres? Sherry. It's good to see you. Yeah, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I just had to sit down a minute. Things have been dry around here, so... coming down hasn't been so good. I heard you got clean. No, no. Hey, have you got anything? No. How's Danny? Junkie flipped out. Got all weird on us, no one's seen him in a while. If you get your hands on anything, will you find me? We can do it together. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see you later, Sherry. Mom? Hi. - Yeah? - What are you doing? I'm praying... for your brother. Why? Because I'm desperate and I'm... worried about him and... I don't know what to do so I'm asking God for help. Can God hear you in the bathroom? Yeah. I think so. - Can I try? - Yeah. Of course. Come on, baby. Here. Close your eyes. - Say "Dear God..." - Dear God... "...Victor needs Your help." Victor needs your help. - Show me your hands! - Whoa. That's not cool, man. Do you got any good stuff, huh? I was just gonna ask you the same. - Whole 'hood is dry, cat. - Since when, man? Two days ago. The narcos did their job. Yeah, I need a hit bad. Yeah. A'ight, come on, follow me. - Come on. - Come on. You boys got a prescription for that stuff? - Keep it down. - Grab that. The store is now open. - Hey! - Got it, got it, got it. What's that? You're gonna share it? 'Teo, Victor, let's go! Victor, come on! Thought you were asleep. You havin' nightmares? No. Ma and Pa said you can't do that anymore. I told you I'm sorry, kid, okay? Just go to Ma's room and don't tell her. Ricky? I, um... Eh, nothin'. Nothin'. Just... just go away. Just go away! Ricky? Hey, Ricky. Mi amor,what are you doing out here? Huh? Victor? Victor! Victor. Victor! Manuel! Oh God, no, please, Father. No! Victor, wake up! Wake up, Victor! Wake up! Thank you, God. Thank you, Father God! Thank you so much! I want you to stay awake. Get him up. Get him up. Come on. Let him go for a minute. Who is it? - Matteo. - What happened? Matteo. Mi amor. Oh, thank you, God. I'm gonna go talk to him. Hey. How can you be high right now? Again, after you almost died, and your friend is dead. I want to understand. I need a fix just to function, just to get normal. This is not normal. Do you want to get better, hmm? - Do you? - I can't! I can't, Ma. Well, that is not an option, mi amor. You are coming with us. This is something different, and I believe in it. Okay? Mr. Torres. Hey, how are you? Is this Victor? This is Victor. Victor, this is Derek. - Hey. - Go ahead. Stand direct. How do you know this guy? I've been doing some work here, son, okay? - Hi, Pastor. - Hi, how are you? Thank you. - Manuel. - Jimmy. Ah, Victor. How are you? Top of the world, pastor man. Are you high right now? It's a place for junkies, right? We can't take him in high, I'm sorry. He has to be thinking clearly, and he has to want it. - Pastor, por favor. - It's a very... It's a very important part of this work. - Please come back tomorrow. - Pastor, please. Hey, Pastor Jimmy. Maybe they can wait in the chapel while I talk to you for a minute? Show them the chapel. Excuse me. Thank you. Come with me. - Thank you. - He'll be back, just wait here. Thank you. What are we, religious all of a sudden? - Where are you going? - Outside to clear my head. Hey, Vic, Vic! You know that this is it, right? This is it! Yeah, I get it. Dios mio. Por favor, Dios mio. - Por favor. - Lila, listen. Do you think this prayer thing is gonna make a difference, huh? Stop, come on. This is a matter of faith, Manuel. Do you really believe that? I spent so many nights crying over the opportunities that I had to stop Victor from this. What could I have done different? What could we have done different? But God made Victor for a purpose, and it was not drugs, it's not drugs. So, yes, I believe that there is a hope that is yet to be seen. I believe that. I do. I don't... I don't deserve you, Lila, I'm sorry. If we all got what we deserve, this would be such a scary world. Victor? We're gonna take him in. Victor, you can take your things to room 11. Okay. Jacket. Gotta leave the jacket. I'll take care of it. I will. Lots of rules here, man. The coffee's fantastic though. In this room, the bathroom's in here. You'll be sharing your room. Two bunks. You're on the right. Whichever one you want. Guess I'm supposed to thank you. Do you know each other? Yeah. We got a mutual friend. Hey, man, I'm Spike. Victor. Nice to meet you, Victor. I bet you got some stories to tell. Yeah, I got a few. Saw Sherry not too long ago. Seemed different. Yeah, she's a, uh, Sanchez girl now. Still in love with the junk, man, can't let it go. That's right, it kills me. You're in a good place, Victor. Welcome to the grace that heals. I'll leave you guys to it. Dinner's at six. I'm not gonna lie, man. The first 72 hours of the super flu are brutal. I know, I've tried before. You scared? - No. - Then you're lying to yourself. You ain't gotta do that no more, Vic, not here. You dig? Yeah, I dig. Good. Guess I gotta try this trick out, huh? It's no trick, man. Believe me, I came in as hooked as you. But, uh, they got something here that's better than drugs. One day at a time, man. - Amen. - Amen. Feel free to join me in the harmony next time. That's okay that you left it out this time. So, many of you have already met Victor, but please join me in giving him a warm New Life Center welcome. Victor knows that... we want far more than to help him get clean from drugs. And you are not alone on this journey. God loves you, and He wants so much more for you than drugs and gangs. I mean, you are God's unique design, and He wants you to be free to fully embrace all that He has for you. In John Chapter 8, Jesus says, "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." Amen, Pastor. Dear Lord, I know you can hear me in the bathroom. Oh, Lord, be with my big brother. Our family needs you. Victor needs you. I know you can hear me. Our family needs you. My big brother needs you. Please, please, help him. Victor needs you. In Jesus' name, amen. Ahh, I need a hit, I need a hit, I need... I need it so bad. Victor needs his strength, so give him strength that only comes from you. Shut up with that, shut up! No, no, get away! I need a hit, man! Man, I'm dying here, okay? Can't you see I'm dying here? Heavenly Father, we need You in this place right now. Heal Your son, Victor. It's crazy! God is in this with you. Victor needs Your help right now, Lord. How you doin'? - Fantastic. - Oh. Sorry. Can't do this on your own, you know. Well, why don't you grab a mop and help? Well, I'd be happy to, but you know that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not high, okay? Do I look high? You look angry. Well, I'm doing it my way. I know. How's your way been working out for you? Surrender, man. It takes surrender. Yeah? Great. Then I give up, huh? Hey, Vic, wait! I can't do it, man. I gotta get a fix and figure this all out. How many second chances you think you're gonna get? Huh? Vic, you and I both know, you walk out that gate, you're done. Come on, man, don't lose hope. You and me, we... We should be dead, or in jail, but... I mean, what, we're here. Forgiveness is real. Man, you know all that I was responsible for. The drugs, the death. I feel like I'm dead already. Man, you tried everything else, huh, you've told me. Hmm? None of it worked. Hospitals, cold turkey, everything. None of it worked. It's because your problem ain't the drugs, the needle. It's the same problem that we all got, all of us. I can't believe the same cat that stuck a shotgun up my nose is giving me the preacher's speech. Vic... Man, I ain't preachin'. I'm just telling you what happened to me. I didn't get a Band-Aid for getting off smack. Everything changed. I got a whole new purpose. You need it, too, Vic. I'm tired of living this way, man. I don't want this anymore. I don't. Okay. I'm dying. I don't want to die like Matteo, man, I don't. I'm sick of being an addict, man, I'm sick of being an addict. I'm sick of it, man. I'm sick of being an addict, man! I'm sick of being an addict! You got the will, man. You just need the power. I need a minute alone, man. Okay. All right. Look, all I can keep telling you is the truth. Jesus loves you, Victor. He definitely created you for more than this. You there? Are You up there? Are You up there?! Are You up there?! Are You up there?! Hmm? Please. Hey, just once. Enjoy the ride, Vicky. Wake up, wake up! Wake up! Wake up. Wouldn't you rather me do it with someone I trust? Have you got anything? You want to know what it feels like, Victor? It should've been you. Go. Please, God. I surrender. Please. Forgive me, God. Please. Thank You, Jesus. You boys seen Victor? No, not since this morning. He's, uh, been on a new high since the chapel. He's gone. Are you sure he's not out front dancing? I'm serious, Spike, he took his jacket. Well, the prodigal son returns. Victor Torres, stupid mouse that was bad-mouthing my smack, spreading lies. You know, I've been meaning to get rid of you, and here you are. Now, what are you here for? For Sherry. Sherry? Tell you what, amigo. You want her? Come. Sit. Let's make a deal. You don't own her. She's here by her own choice. Mmm, exactly. Sit. You see how it is, don't you? We got some new stuff now since, uh, you went away. Oh, you think you've been high before? You never felt like this. You can tell just by looking at it, can't you? Yeah. Here's the deal, el hombre. I'll let you taste, but you gotta sell the first 20 bags for free. Show of goodwill. I just came for Sherry. Let's just go for a walk. Mmm, wait. There's no rush. Quick fix, and you can take the tecata on the ride of your life. Take her wherever you wanna go. Come on. Welcome home, Victor. No! I'm a free man. You're a dead man. Come on, Sherry. Are you crazy? He'll kill you, Victor. She's right, you know. I'm not afraid of you. Really? I understand what real power is now. And you don't have it. Cat really is high. Go on, get outta here. You're not worth the gunpowder. Victor! You can't run off like that. I-I know, Jimmy, I know, I'm sorry. I just had to... With God's help this time. This is Sherry. Hello, Sherry. Look, you know the rules, Victor. No gang jackets. Thank God. Are you okay? Are you okay? Victor brought me. Vic? Sherry, let's find your room. Away from these two boys, okay? Vic. Thanks, man. Payback. How are you? This time has been great. I'm ready to be home. An answer to my prayers. Don't stop, please. I never did. - Ma. - Hmm? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I really am. I love you, Victor. And there's nothing you can ever do to change that. We all fall short. It's all the same to God. We all need His forgiveness. Thanks, Ma. I love you. I love you, too, son. - Hey! - Victor! - There he is! - Hey, little man! Ahh, welcome home, Vic. Welcome, my boys! ¿Cómo estás, Manuel? You wanna help Mommy get the food? I love you, Pa. I love you, son. Victor. Come on, my boy! Bailar con tu mami. Ahh, I beat you! Take a picture. Ahh, real quickly. Picture time, picture time. Smile. Very nice. Oh, here's my toy. Pastor Jimmy offered me a job. Are you gonna do it? It's a job helping to start a new rehab center. Victor, that's amazing news! - Well, that's great. - Wow, yeah! - That's great. - Yay, Victor. It's in Boston. Boston? Yeah. Ah, Boston. Victor, Vic, come here. I love Victor. - Boston? - I know you do, baby. - Yeah. - Ooh! So tell me. What do you think? I don't know. I'm just thinking about Matteo and Razor, and even the guys at the center who left early. If I could just help just one guy... Ricky! - Come here. - Go, Papi's calling you. I will miss you, Victor. Mmm, come here. I love you so much. I never thought I'd end up on this road when we moved from Puerto Rico to Brooklyn. But if God can love a rebel like me, I guess anything is possible.
