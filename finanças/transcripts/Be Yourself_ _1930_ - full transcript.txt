How are you? Hiya, Frank. Hello, you all. Mac, my boy, I'm proud of you. Hello, Mac. That was some fight you put up there. Did you like it? I'll say I did. Mountains snap their fingers at times since this old world began. But they're mole hills compared to the mountains you'll climb when a gal cares for a man. Rivers have been flowing for years, part of the mighty plan. But they're ripples compared to the river of tears when a gal weeps for a man. Beggar or millionaire crooked or on the square Mansion or furnished room, she doesn't care when a woman loves a man. Sharing his pain and ills both going through the mill Just being miserable gives her a thrill when a woman loves a man. He may be conceited, a weakling who cheated But still one woman in town can't help but feel that some day he'll settle down. When you pile up your seven seas mountains and rocks and trees and you're up against a thing stronger than these when a woman loves a man. Beggar or millionaire crooked or on the square Hello, Lil. Mansion or furnished room, she doesn't care when a woman loves a man. Sharing his pain and ills both going through the mill See you later, sweetheart. Okay, honey, I'll be right here. ... When a woman loves a man... Okay? Don't forget. He may be conceited, a weakling who's cheated But still one woman in town can't help but feel that some day he'll settle down. Pile up the seven seas mountains, rocks and trees you're up against a thing stronger than these When a woman loves a man. Crooked or on the square Mansion or furnished room, she doesn't care when a woman loves a man. Pooh-pooh-pa-dooh. Furnished ah... room with a... just being satisfied knowing... when a woman loves a man. Pooh-pooh-pa-dooh. ...a weakling who cheated but still one woman in town can't help but feel that someday he'll settle down, pooh-pooh-pa-doo... Pile up the seven seas ... rocks and trees and you're up against a thing stronger than these when a woman pooh-pooh-pa-dooh. Doesn't your elbow ever get tired? I'm giving a party. A party? To whom? To me. I just canned my manager. I'm looking for another one. Do you know one? Keep training on that and you wouldn't need a manager. Well, I certainly don't need one around here. These heels in this town won't fight me. I got 'em scared. I'm gonna leave this bird flat on its so and so. Going away? Why not? An outsider's got no chance around here. You couldn't break into a fight game with a crowbar. They got it all sewed up. It's a racket. So is tennis. But you got to be sober to play it. Liquor never hurt my old man. He's been drinking all his life and he's 80 years old. Wait. It'll get him. Well, as far as I'm concerned, you can have me right now. I'll be sorry to see you go, Jerry. Yeah? You're a funny girl, Fannie. I gotta be. That's how I make my living. No. I mean you pass up these other mugs around here and come over and sit down with me. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because you seem kinda lonesome. And I've taken you for a square shooter. And then again maybe it's because sometimes you seem like a little boy. You know, Fannie... when you ain't clownin' You ain't bad lookin'. Honest? Hey, Fannie. I got some friends here I want you to meet. By and by, Mac. But I want you to meet 'em now. Oh, I'm having too good a time right here. Aw, come on. Scram! You slug nutty ape, don't tell me to scram. Well, then, amscray! Oh, Mac, what's the matter with you? You're acting like a little baby. Certainly. Who do you think you... Who do you think you are, anyway? I'll show you who I am. Sit down, Mac. Sit down. This guy don't like the way I talk. He wants to know who I am. All right, Mac, all right. Listen, honey, you're too big a guy to hit anyone outside the ring. Why, a great fighter like you don't start brawls in a caf?. Besides, you have your reputation to consider. Yeah, I guess you're right, Lil. I gotta think about my reputation. But somebody better tip that ape off who I am. You know it's lucky for that cheese champ I didn't take a pump at him. He's got all the luck. Ain't it the truth? Better get ready for your next number, Fannie. I'm coming right along, Step. Stick around, I'll be back. Say, listen. Lay off those window washers. Those pooh-pooh-padooh- pooh-poops. If anyone said that to me I'd turn on him like a flash. I looked him right in the eye and told the big Bozo if he didn't marry me I'd shoot myself. And what did he say? You should have seen his face when he begged me for time to think it over. I told him he had to make up his mind and let me know by tonight. Yeah? Sure. Come in. Package for you, Miss Wilson. Thanks. It's from him. A wedding present. Ain't it exciting? Well, I never could say he wasn't liberal. A gun! Well, of all the dirty low-down tricks. Somebody sent you a present? He must think a lot of you. The dirty tramp. What do you want to call him names for? He figured a poor little innocent girl like you needed something for protection. Oh, yeah? It ain't his fault if it came five years too late. Oh, you think you're funny, don't you? That's McCloskey, he's always butting in here. I don't want to see that pest. Fannie, if you're not in, why don't you say so? I'm not in. Oh, your brother. Yeah, that bright young lawyer. Are you decent? Where's Fannie? Fannie, congratulations. Congratulations, thanks. Congratulations, thank you. I won, I won, Fannie. Verdict for the plaintiff on a fifty-fifty basis, and I get half. Half! The jury just brought it in. I wanted you to be the first to hear it. You mean you won a case? My first first important litigation. Didn't I tell you, Fannie, I couldn't lose? Not under section 346 of our Code. The minute I said it to the judge, he said to me, Harry, my boy... I beg your pardon? What kind of a case was it? Oh, damages. Damages for difammation of my client's character. Two hundred thousand dollars, I sued for. How much was the verdict? From 3 o'clock till just now the jury was out deliberating. Tomorrow you'll see it in all the papers. I gave all the reporters a copy of my speech. You think I'm a fool? Yeah, but how much was the verdict? Of course, I could have sued under Section 541 but I picked Section 346 because it also provided for putative damages Smart, ain't it? Harry, how much? Fannie, don't be so mercenary. I'm telling you, I won my first big case. Think of the glory when you see... Never mind the glory. What I want to know is how much did you win? Well, the verdict was for 6 cents. Six c... Yeah, but the very fact that the verdict was in my favor definitely makes it... Six cents. And you get half. Three cents. What's the matter with you there? Well, now you can buy an envelope and a two-cent stamp and you can write home and tell Mama. And for that I paid three years in Law School, two years' office rent. He had to be a lawyer. Nothing else would do. A lawyer he had to be. (IN YIDDISH) That's all right, Fannie. You'll get it all back someday. Yeah, three cents. Now that I've broken the ice you can never can tell what's going to happen. What's this? Under Section 729 it's a felony to possess a deadly weapon. Oh, a guy sent it to me. If he meant it as an insult I think you've got a very good suit under Section... 819, yes, 819. Yeah, well I'll sue him for worse than that if he don't marry me. Say, breech of promise is a good case, too. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll take your case fifty-fifty and believe me, you couldn't do better no place... Second number Fannie. Okay. ...because I know all the judges and if you listen to me I could get you at least... Six cents! Please, Fannie, who's asking you? I had a similar case once with Mathilda Levcovitch Her uncle M. Levcovitch came to me and told me that Montgomery Levcovitch said to her... Listen, Miss Ritz, I didn't ask you to come to my table just to hear myself talk. Get me? Hey, if you wanna hold hands with somebody, I'd be delighted. Sit down, Jerry. Relax. Mac's only clowning. If you got any complaints to make we got a special department for them. Stay right here. I'm gonna go change. Take my advice. Don't even shake hands with him. Unless you shake both of them. Go to your rooms. There's a fight! What's going on here? Who's fighting? Hey, what's the matter? Cut out your shoving. Who's shoving? You're shoving me I'm not shoving you. Aw, that's a lie, cut it out, that's all. I'm a lawyer, I can... Bring him in here. All you girls go to your rooms. I'll need witnesses. Get names and addresses. Everyone who saw the assault. You understand? What are you standing here like dummies? I'm telling you I need witnesses. Go out and get witnesses... What's the matter with you? Standing and looking here. Well, you finally got a fight. I'd like to see this guy fight when he isn't drunk. Maybe when he isn't drunk he wouldn't fight. This guy's got a real wallop. Yes? He fought McCloskey once. Is that possible? Did I kill him? Not yet. He's still breathing a little. What hospital did they take him to? I always send him flowers. Well, this time you won't have to bother. Are you all right, kid? All right? He never touched me. How could you say such a thing, "he never touched me." Why, it was a malicious unprovoked assault. For nothing, for nothing at all a guy jumps up and he hits you. He did not, I hit him first. Oh, you, you, you... you shlemiel... You don't know what you're talking about. He hit you first. Oh, go on, I hit him first. Fannie. If my brother says he hit you first, he hit you first. Yeah? It's a clear case of assault and battery. Well he couldn't do nothing to me for it, could he? I'm gonna sue him. You are? Yes, damages. Heavy damages. And I think under Section 952 I might even make it with intent to kill. But I didn't intend to kil him. No, he hit you with intent to kill. He did not, I hit him. My brother says he hit you with intent to kill. And if my brother says he hit you with intent to kill You're already dead. I'll kill him if I ever get him in a ring. He might at that. Say, kid, who's your manager? I ain't got any, but all I need is a good manager... But you got a good lawyer. Sure, you got a good lawyer. Step, you really think the kid's got it? Sure looked it out there. You say he did have a wallop, didn't he? Wallop? Say, when he landed that right to McCloskey's jaw it looked like curtains for McCloskey. You want a manager? You've got a manager. Yeah, where is he? Him. I, I, I, I'm a lawyer. No, you're a manager. Harry, don't argue with me, I've had an idea. Don't get me angry, listen, I'm telling you, you're a... Harry, you're a manager. All right, I'm a manager. So, all right. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. Fannie. What? Please, come quick. I want to talk to you very privately. One, two. One, two. One, two... Fannie, it'a a calamity. It's worse, it's a catastrophe. It's, it's, it's terrible. Here, look for yourself. Read there. The second preliminary on tomorrow night's card is a four-round bop between Slug McNut and Jerry Moore. How Moore got on the card at all is a mystery. He hails from Racine, Wisconsin, where he has a record of four fights. He won the technical decision over Sandy Brown. Read, read. read further. He won the technical decision over Sandy Brown by claiming a foul. His second fight was with Cocky Wexler. He dropped to his back in the second round and again claimed a foul but the referee counted him out. Next he was matched up against Dopey Dwyer Again he dropped to his back in the first round but was saved by the bell at the count of eight. He failed to come back for the second round claiming he had been doped. His last fight in Racine was with Lefty Schnitzler Lefty landed a light left hook to the stomach and Moore promptly dropped on his back. Instead of counting him out, the referee picked him up and rushed him out of the ring to save him from mob violence. That was the last scene of him in Racine. Here is one guy that you can't knock off his back. He's a dog. He's a lay-down dog. Maybe it ain't as bad as it sounds. Let's look. Fannie! He's still on his back. On his back? Would you like a pillow? Look. The cord broke. Look, the cord broke! Get off your back, you turtle. I gotta lie down once in a while. Once in a while? With him it's a habit. Get up on those round heels. Let me rest. That's a tough guy I'm up against tomorrow night. Yeah? Well, read that. If I'm not asking too much, would you mind sitting up? Them newspaper guys has always been sore at me. Yeah, you and Peggy Joyce. Who's she? Listen, I had to flip that matchmaker 200 dollars to get you into this fight. I did it because I thought you could scrap and I wanted to give you a chance. I spent 15 hundred dollars training you. Why, this stuff alone cost me $920. And it wouldn't bring $150 in a foresale. Who's asking you? I made a statement. Why didn't you tell me you had sleeping sickness? I tell you it was the booze that made him fight in the caf?. He's a booze fighter. Hey, pipe down, sawyer. Sawyer? I don't even know him. Tomorrow night you fight to win. That's something new to you, ain't it? What do you mean? I mean you gotta win. But not by yelling foul the first time you're hit below the eyes. Yeah? Yeah. Turn out the lights, them guys wanna be alone. Aw, pluck him, he's a ham. Break! Break it up! Come on, break it. Now listen you guys, get in here and fight. I mean the both of you. Get together, come on! Say, they oughta kill that guy and his manager too. Hey, turn on the lights. I wanna read. Come on, Jerry, give it to him. Go on! Fannie, look! He's on his back! Get off your back! Get off your back, you turtle. Get off your back! Get up! You heard me. Get up! Fannie, he can fight. Yeah, if he'll stay off his back. Mornings, I'll be gettin' up Mornin's I'll be settin' up a tiny table for two. Breakfast, I'll be making his breakfast he'll be taking his shave and his shower. My happy hour. The coffee is steamin' Oh, boy, what I'm dreamin' while I'm cookin' breakfast for the one I love. My baby likes bacon and that's what I'm bakin' while I'm cookin' breakfast For the one I love Our life has been so nice and chummy right from the start When I won his tummy I won his heart. My baby is happy. No wonder I'm happy while I'm cooking breakfast for the one I love. I'm bakin' that biscuit He's willing to risk it while I'm cookin' breakfast for the one I love. He's crazy for grapefruit I'd rather have grape-nuts While I'm cooking breakfast For the one I love. A plate of steaming oatmeal Taste it! Aw, schucks! Who the heck wants oatmeal sprinkled with Lux? To show that he's grateful He eats a big plateful. And faints right after breakfast For the one I love. Ah, good morning. I see you're waiting for me, as usual. Good morning. Good morning. Who could that be? I don't know. Hey, listen, you. What's the idea of attaching my share of the game on the Merillo fight tonight? You've been tailing me long enough with that joke suit of yours. Joke? I'm laughing to you. Oh, I'm wise to you. You're trying to get my goat. Goat? I don't want your goat. I want damages. He wouldn't have gone to court. It's all your doing, you cheap little scheister. Scheister? I warn you under Section 541, difammation of character. I oughta take a smack at you. Look out. Section 428 provides and now I am under Section 513. With glasses on. Come on, touch me, touch me. I'm gonna tear you apart. Wait a minute! Tear me apart. As if I was afraid. You ain't gonna tear nobody apart. Oh, no? Who's gonna stop me? Who do you think? Wait. Don't fight here. Fight in the ring. Where you get paid for it. I'd like to get that Bozo in the ring. Well, that could be arranged. What I want is this attachment off. When I fight I don't want nothing bothering me. Oh, you want to settle out of court. Well, that could be arranged amicably or legally. What's your proposition? What right have you to attach my dough? Because under Section 1122... Harry, will you stop talking in sections. Tell him what we want. Mr McCloskey... If you will agree to give my client a match my client will agree to withdraw the suit. Fight him? With pleasure. All right. Then I'll send you up the papers tomorrow to sign. Then I'll witdraw the suit and remove the attachment. Okay. Say, if he can sue me for what I did to him in the caf? they can send me to the chair for what I'll do to him in the ring A laughing hiena. Hey, is that guy laughing at me? Let him laugh. He's so dumb he don't know that he who laughs last lasts laugh... laughs... last laugh... You know the one I mean. The one about laughin'. Yeah. Yeah. Didn't I tell you I'd get you your first big chance? Yeah. You see how it worked? Maybe I didn't send you through Law School for nothing. And he can't back out. Because under Section 296 a verbal agreement... Is not worth the paper it's written on. Fannie, how could you say a thing... Eat, eat, eat. All right, I'll eat. Thank you. But anyhow I'm the one that put it over, you must admit this. You put it over? Oh, Harry, how can you say that? I'm not saying... Now, listen, Harry. You know it was me that winked at you. I admit that you winked... You never would have thought of it. Now, Harry, listen, they were gonna fight and I said... don't fight here, go fight in a ring. Yes. Yes, you said that. I give in to you there... Listen, Harry, give me credit. I'm giving you credit... Harry, I put it over. You put it over? Yeah. All right, you put it over. Am I saying anything? Eat. So I'll eat. But... You put it over. McCloskey shoots the right across to Jerry's chin, just missed... Jerry folds up after that one. I don't blame him. They clinch. Moore ties up another cut coming out. It makes McClosky sore and he tears after Jerry shooting right and left to the body. It's beginning to look like a fight. Moore is sure taking them, McCloskey leads again... Jerry is recovering as we go... He shoots the right across to McCloskey's chin, no harm done... This boy is tough! Jerry is wide open and is jolted by a terrific left hook that sent him to his heels. McCloskey aims right at the jaw... Moore is dragging McCloskey to the right and a left to the stomach Moore holding on for dear life... There goes the bell saving Mr Jerry Moore at the end of the second round. Stand by, ladies and gentlemen for the third round. Well, Fannie, where do you want the body sent? I don't know where Mac lives. I'll have it sent to your house. Oh, yeah? Yes. Listen, you haven't been getting away with this either. Who do you think you are? You and your wisecracks. Cut the argument here. Fannie, you're on. Yeah? Well not for a long time. There goes the bell for the third round. McCloskey dashes out of his corner Moore meets him halfway They spar around, both looking for an opening Moore leads with a left to the head, not much steam behind his punches... McCloskey counters with a left jab trying to get set with that deadly right He lets it go and it lands on the point of Jerry Moore's chin. Fannie, that's enough, you gotta go. Not now, just a minute... Go ahead, we'll call you when he's knocked down. Oh, yeah? Who says he's gonna be knocked down? I'll be here when you're finished! You think I'm afraid? Otto Kahn, the big millionaire is a man who's crazy for art. Singing Slovaks, Greeks and Romanians look to him for their stunts. Gaze upon a dainty vocalist with artistic temperament and to think that great philanthropist he wouldn't even give me a cent. Is there something the matter with Otto Kahn, or something the matter with me? I wrote a note and I told him what a hit I would make He sent it back and marked it opened up by mistake. Why, I'd even get fatter for Otto Kahn as all prima donnas must be. I met Galla Hershey and I trilled like a bird She handed me a razor without saying a word. And if my high C won't hand over a thrill I think my tra-la-la-la will. And the words that I bring and the song that I sing is a song of a heart that's free. And the words that I bring and the song that I sing is a song of a heart that's free. McCloskey's still at the peek Morris is using his famed left trying a little scientific punch in this round. McCloskey is wise to this and he wants to deliver that one too. They shoot left and right both boys gather at the center of the ring, the referee warns the boys McCloskey shoots a terrific right and he missed. He's punched but he's missin'! Yeah, but I'll stuff you one, and I won't miss. You'll do what? You heard me. Listen now, you... One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine Ten! McCloskey is out! And so is this vile friend. My Jerry won! My Jerry won! Jerry won! Jerry won! Oh, Hello, Jerry. Hello, Step. Great stuff. Thanks. There's a table down at the club. Thanks. Congratulations, Jerry. Congratulations, champ. Hello, Ned. Gee, you look swell. Thanks. Say, I rented this. Hello, Jerry. Some wallop. Hello. Your right's a forker See you later, Jerry. Thanks. The coffee is steamin' Oh, boy, what I'm dreamin' While I'm cooking breakfast, breakfast For the one I love. Now, my baby likes bacon so it's bacon I'm makin' While I'm cookin', cookin' breakfast For the one I love. My baby is happy, happy No wonder I'm happy. While I'm cookin' breakfast For the one I love. Come to me, ye dancing fools Throw away your golden rules lovely ladies down in Hades Satan will be waiting with the pleasure you crave Satisfy your appetites with a thousand wild delights Earthly troubles fade like bubbles when you let the devil show you how to behave Don't be frightened and don't believe in Mr Devil's lies Hallelujah The Lord is waiting in the golden skies So, throw up your hands sing out your souls and send the devil where he belongs kicking a hole in the sky. Laugh at the rain laugh at the snow up on your heels, down on your toes kicking a hole in the sky Laugh at your pains, laugh at your blues we'll have the rainbows coming in twos Kicking a hole in the sky.

I'll see you in the dressing room after the next song. All right. Hello, Lil. Hello, Jerry. I just came over to tell you how happy I am. Yeah? It's time somebody licked that big bag of wind. And I'm tickled to death it was you that done it. What? I know you're surprised my talking this way. But I've been rooting for you. Yes, I have. Ever since that night he talked to you when you were drinking. Do you remember how I dragged him away? But I thought you was... I know. You thought I was sweet on him. Say... why, I couldn't fall for that guy. I have to be nice to him. You know, he's a big spender here. You understand. Don't you, Jerry? Oh, sure, sure, I understand. I'm giving a little party up at the house tonight. I'd sure like to have you come up. Fannie kind of expects me to be with her... I know, but you're entitled to some fun. I'm just crazy to have you. Won't you, Jerry? Please. Well, er... er... But I gotta give credit, where credit is due, and Jerry deserves an awful lot of credit because he followed my instructions to the letter. If prize fighters would only realize what a good lawyer could do for them Yessir, every paper that he signed was legally 100% correct. And if you girls don't think I'm gonna make him the world's champion... you're even dumber than I thought you were. You're gonna make him the world's champion. Well, that is, of course, provided he doesn't lose his head. You mean, if he doesn't lose my head. Maybe. And besides being a great fighter you'd be handsome if it wasn't for that nose. What's the matter with my nose? Jerry, why don't you have it fixed? Hm? You'd look swell. Honest you would. Aw, you're kidding me. No, I'm on the level. The one consuming passion of my life is not to play a fiddle or a pipe. I want to be a dancer my spirit fancy free (...) I long to be so slender and so slim. To show my limb to him and him and him My dress is a cocoon If I don't breathe I'll swoon Oh, I can't get this outfit off too soon I'll take it off, yes I will, no I wouldn't... Oh, it's gorgeous to be graceful to fleet and float and fly. to make like this and make like that and let the evening breeze go by. In public I'm Phoenecian but Grecian on the sly I bought myself a bearskin It makes me so appealing When I dance in my bearskin I show a lot of feeling Oh, it's gorgeous to be graceful (...) It's gorgeous to be graceful and to fleet and float and fly. You won't disappoint me, will you, Jerry? I'll see you later. Come in. Gee, Fannie, you was funny. Did you like it, Jerry? I like everything you do. That dance certainly is hard work, ain't it? It sure is. It always tires me out. Yeah. Guess you're pretty tired yourself. Yeah, I am. That was a tough scrap I had. Would you mind very much if I didn't wait for you tonight? If you don't want to wait, Jerry, it's all right with me. Well, you understand... Sure. I understand. Well... Good night. Good night, Jerry. Hey, I wonder how much it would cost to get this nose of mine fixed up. You mean by one of those trick surgeons? Well, I wouldn't want no carpenter doing it. I imagine it costs plenty. What's the use of having it fixed when some guy will come along and unfix it? What guy? Say, I look like a different person. Don't I? I'll say so. Didn't I tell you you'd be handsome? You know, a lot of people is gonna be surprised when they see me, eh, Lil? You're the only one that knows about it. I'm gonna be awfully proud of you, Jerry. That's why I done it. Somebody's at the door. Hello, Fannie. Hello, Jerry. So this is where you've been hanging out. So you had it fixed, eh? I'm pretty good lookin' now, eh, Fannie? Yeah, you'll look great steppin' into the ring. Thanks. But when they carry you out... Hey, listen, the Bozo don't live that can mess up my nose. No wonder I couldn't find you for the past two weeks. Hello, Fannie. Oh... You. Swell apartment. Swell nose. Swell dame. And for you a swell finish. What do you mean? They come and go with you, don't they? One champ after the other. It's a very good idea, don't you think, Fannie? I'll give you a better idea. You leave him alone. He's got a career ahead of him. And he don't need a tramp like you to ruin him. Don't you dare call me a tramp. You've never been anything else but a tramp. Don't talk like that to her, Fannie. She's gonna hear what I've gotta say and like it. And you too, you big boob. You weren't fooling me. I knew you were running around with her. But I thought you'd get wise to yourself. Why, a blind man can see what she is. Fannie, you got no right to talk like this. She's heard worse than anything I've said. Let her tell you what Mac's wife said to her when she took up with him. Oh, go ahead, rave on. I'll do worse than rave. No, you won't. I won't let you. Not about my future wife. Your what? Sure, me and Lil's gonna get married. Oh, that's how it is. Yes, that's how it is. If you have anything more to tell on me spill it right now, or shut your big mouth and get out. So you think she's gonna marry you. What an awakening you're gonna have. Aw, Fannie, why can't we all be friends? I'll always be your friend, Jerry. And you'll keep right on being me manager. You know you're the real manager. Sure, I'll manage you. Anything you say. Of course, Jerry and I always did appreciate that you were a good businesswoman. That's what I am, a businesswoman? That's all it's ever been with us, Jerry. Business. Sure, that's all. That's all. Mountains snap their fingers at times since this whole world began But they're mole hills compared to the mountains she'll climb when a gal cares for a man. Rivers have been flowing for years part of the mighty plan But they're ripples compared to the river of tears when a gal weeps for a man. Beggar or millionaire crooked or on the square mansion or furnished room she doesn't care when a woman loves a man. Fannie certainly puts a lot of feeling into that song, don't she? Both going through the mill... Jerry, darling, please fasten this for me. Just being miserable gives her a thrill. Thank you, honey. When a woman loves a man. He may be conceited, a weakling who cheated But still one woman in town Can't help but feel that some day he'll settle down Pile up the seven seas mountains and rocks and trees and you're up against a thing stronger than these When a woman... loves... a man. Oh, hello, Fannie. Fannie, I tell you, will you laugh. I just heard one of the funniest stories I ever heard in my life. I don't want to hear it. You're not acting like yourself at all, Fannie. You haven't been for the last four weeks. And I can't bear to see you like this. Honest, you're making me very unhappy. And you shouldn't do it. Even if you've lost that prize fighter, you've still got me. And besides, what have you got to be unhappy about? You've got your health, you're making good money. You're getting offers from Broadway managers. Why, you're a big success, Fannie. And if you listen to me... Harry. Yes, dear. Will you do me a favor? Sure. Leave me alone. Leave you alone. It's sad enough when a girl like you grieves herself sick over a cheap prize fighter. What do you see in him, anyhow? Just answer me this, tell me. What do you see in him? I wouldn't care if she was on the level. But she's only a cheap gold digger. Oh, what's the difference who takes him? One gold digger is the same as the other. She only wants him while he's champ. Then she'll give him the air like she did Mac. Oh, he'll see through her in time. And besides, you know, we're still his manager. Yeah. We're still his manager. Sure we are. I'd almost forgotten. Harry, I want you to do something. I want you to arrange a return match with McCloskey. McCloskey's in great shape. He's likely to lick him. Do as I tell you, see McCloskey's manager. Tell them they can have a return match, the sooner the better. Go on, do it. Do it now. Fannie... Oh, Harry, I know what I'm doing. All right. Don't get excited. I'll do it. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Everybody's excited around here. Love. Crazy people. Why, I didn't think of it before. You're doing fine. But what's the idea? when you had him going, why didn't you knock him out? I'm playing with him, I'll murder... Save your wind, save your wind. All you have to do is use your left. Stick the left as fast as you can and you can't lose. If you get your left on his face... Stop talkin'. Did I say something? You can't lose, Mac. Go out there and sock him. Just sock him. Smell, smell. Drink. Take, take. It's good for you. Spit there. Relax, will ya? Please! Keep your left in his face all the time. Come on, you got him, Jerry! That's it, that's it! Go for the nose. One! Go for the nose. Two! What are you talking to him for? Did you hear me? Go for the nose. Beat his nose, he'll try to protect it. The nose, the beezer. The beezer, the schnozzle... The beezer, go for the nose. That's it! You got him going, Mac. That's fine! Go on! That's it. Don't let up on him. Go on, hit him right on the beezer. Shut up, will ya. I know what I'm doin'. two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight, nine, out. Here, put him here, please. I want the dope on this. Wait a minute, boys. Please, wait a minute. Give me a chance I'll give you all a statement as soon as I know what I'm talking about. Wait a minute, please. You see what you've done? You've lost a championship for us. What was the idea of yelling "Hit him in the nose", "Hit him in the beezer" "Hit him in the schnozzle." Because I liked his old nose better. Yeah. Did I kill him? Did I kill him? You should live so long. Fannie, tell him. Did he kill him? What are you doing here? I just came in to see if I could be of any help. Yeah, a lot of help you are. You doublecrossing... Tipping that guy off just when I had him licked. Oh, go on. Get out of here. You really want me to go? You made me lose the championship. Fannie, what did you do it for? I'm sorry, Jerry. But somebody had to bring you to your senses. A little longer and nothing could have saved you. I couldn't stand by and see you dragged down by somebody like her. Thanks for the tip, Fanny. But I'd have knocked him out, anyway. Yes, you would. Mac, what are you doing in here? I came here to tell this this punch drunk pug to lay off you from now on. Lillian, you're not... Look what you did to his nose, Mac. Well, darling, don't be long. I'll wait for you out in the car. Right. Now get this. If I ever catch you with Lil again I'll beat your ears off. Are you gonna let him get away with that? Get out of here. You better get out before he throws you out. Him throw me out? Ha! Hey, what is this here? How many times I have to tell you you shouldn't fight for nothing. Let him fight. Get in there, Jerry. Use that right! Get in closer! Sock him! Fannie, under Section 219 you can't do a thing like that. Never mind Section 219. Hit him in the midsection. Go on in there, Jerry. Go on, Jerry, you got him. You got him, Jerry. You got him. One, two, three, four, five and five are ten. You're out. I knew you could do it. You can lick any guy in the world. You mean we can. SUBTITLES: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
