"To escape, you need to firmly know not where you are running, but from where." Is it Pelevin? Might be, which book exactly? "Life of the Insects"? "Omon Ra"? Aim higher. "Chapayev and Void"! - Right? - Yeah, right! Have you read it? - What? - "Chapayev and Void" by Pelevin. Yes, I know about Pelevin, but I haven't read it yet. It's on my list. Definitely. - Next! - Who's next? My turn. "Only the parts of us will ever touch only the parts of others". - Wow! - Right? Yes? No? Don't know? Anna Akhmatova? Pretty close. It's pronounced AkhmAtova. Pretty, pretty, pretty close. Now in original language. "Only the parts of us will ever touch only the parts of others." Yes? No? Don't Know? Marilyn Monroe. "PETROGLYPHS OF MURMANSK" Is everything okay? Yes. Everything's okay. Come, I want to introduce you to my former professor. Let's go. I'll be right over. Let me introduce my Finnish friend to you. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. She is leaving Moscow tomorrow to the Murmansk Region to see the petroglyphs. That's really amazing. Irina is talking about etroglyphs all the time. Not only me, you were also impressed by them. Yes, of course. I'm really excited to go there and see the petroglyphs. Do you study archeology? No, but I'd like to. I came here to study the language but then I met Irina, and... It's a natural need. It's important for us to know where we come from. Yes. It's easier to understand the present, if you know the past. Right? Right. My friends! My friends! I'd like to raise a toast to my lovely Finnish friend who is traveling tomorrow far away to the north, to the Arctic, to see the petroglyphs. Hey! Here's to you, my dear! May this journey be unforgettable for you! - Okay? - Thanks. Yay! Let me take a picture of you all. Sit down. Come sit here. Who is she? Irina's "lodger". Sit down, please. Come one! Three! And now! There! Let's dance. I am sorry I had to cancel my trip. But it was not my decision. It's okay. Have your passports ready. There's no rush. I have all the time in the world. I'm sorry, I do have a passport, I put it here but... Here! You both are heading to Murmansk. No spitting on the floor, no littering in the toilet. Enjoy your journey! Thanks. Are you done? No. We're closing. We're closing. Hey! I thought you would never come. What's wrong? Is it your first time on train, huh? No. Hey! Look! Hey! Film it! Look at this snowstorm. Come on! Hey! Come here! Get down here! Come on! You've got a camera. Come on. Come here, film it. Down... Alright... A fucking great snowstorm. Come on, turn it on. Look! Wow! Russia is a great country. We... We beat the Nazis. The Moon... We went there! You know... we... you know... Listen... What do you... What do you have in Estonia, which we don't have here? What? Not a fuck! How do you say... I'm from Finland. - What? - I'm from Finland. - I don't give a fuck. How do you say it in Finnish? How do you say "Hi"? How? - It's "Hei". - Hei! Got it? Hei! Hei! "Hei" it is... It's... Bye! I mean, "Bye". See you! How do you say "Bye-bye", "Goodbye"? - "Hei hei". - Shit! Fuck me! Really? "Hei hei"? This is like hei! Hei hei! Shit. This sounds so stupid. In Russian we have many words for... Snow! Snowstorm! And... blizzard! Whiteout, it's when... Whiteout! It's when... How do you say... look... How do you say... "I love you"? It's "haista vittu" [fuck you]. - What? - Haista vittu [fuck you]. That's it! Alright. You! Haista vittu. - Got it? - Something like that. Haista vittu. So you got it? Alright. So tell me. What are you doing on the train alone? Selling your cunt? I don't understand what you're trying to say. I mean, pussy? You're selling it? You're... selling... Your pussy? Fuck! You... Oh, shit! Fuck me! Ouch! I can't stay there. I can't sleep... Can't you? You think, you have a choice? Are you serious? You break it, then put it together. - What are you doing? - I'm putting yellow one in. Excuse me, are these free? No, both are taken. They've gone to the dining car. Don't you have a ticket? St. Petersburg! Get up! Get up! St. Petersburg! Excuse me. Excuse me. When is the next train to Moscow? In an hour. Thanks. - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Oh, hi! I'm in St. Petersburg. In St. Pete's? Why? Don't say you're coming back already? Hello? No, of course not. It's just... The train stays here for a while, and I saw a phone so... I'll be right there. I see. So how are you? Lucky with your compartment mates? They're on the table. Well, not exactly. He's a bit weird. Just a second. You are never alone, are you? What are you saying? Hello? I have to get back on the train. I see. I have to go, too. I'm glad you're fine. Enjoy the trip, it'll be great! - Thank you. - Bye! Hey, lad. I told you the place was taken. Come on, get down. Here, have a tangerine. You think, I'm a thief? What? What? Why did you take your backpack with you? So that I wouldn't steal it? No. I just didn't plan to get back on the train. So why did you? Fuck! - Here's your salad. - Thank you. Are you ready to order? I'm fucking not. You look so serious all the time. You'll get old too soon and be all covered with wrinkles. Thank you, I know. Just saying. So you're heading to Murmansk? What for? To sell my cunt. I'm going to see the petroglyphs. What are these... petroglyphs? Petroglyphs. Rock paintings. Not a clue. What are they? What's so special about them? They're 10,000 years old. So what? I study archeology at the university, it's interesting to me. So you'll look at them, these drawings, and then what? Well, I think we have to know where we come from. Well, it's a natural need for human beings. It's easier to understand the present, if you know the past. That means, you're taking this train, fuck, to that shithole... Just to look... Unbelievable. Fuck... And you? Why are you going there? To work, for fuck's sake. What's your job? You've heard of Olenegorsk GOK? What is GOK? Well... GOK is a mining and processing combine. Shit. It's a huge mine. You know. Are you a builder? Oh screw it! Okay, a builder. You know, it's just to make some dough. I'm saving for my own bureau. For a bureau? Well... Yeah... For an office. For business. What kind of business? Fuck. Just business. So do you have a boyfriend? Yes. What's his name? What does it matter? - Finnish? - No, Russian. And what does he do? He... is a progessor. Of literature. A professor... - Excuse me, may we sit here? - Yes. Sure. - Who's sitting near the window? - Me! - Sit down. - And you sit here. - You're a foreigner, right? - Yes, I'm from Finland. - A tourist? - No, I'm not a tourist. I'm studying archeology at... the Moscow University... Excuse me, is the salad good? Excuse me, is the salad good? - Yes, really good... - Alright Can I pass? - I'm off. Oh sorry. - Sorry. We didn't notice your friend. No, we are not friends, just sharing the same compartment. So what are you having? Pancakes with jam? You'll have pancakes. - So pancakes with jam for everybody? - Yes! - Right. - Strawberry jam! - Strawberry jam! - Right. And a salad. - Yes - Goodbye. - Have a nice day. Have a nice day. Irina, my love... greetings from... from... from... I don't know where. But... There is a... an old lady, pickles. Another old lady. And... that's... my neighbour. He sleeps there. I wish this were your bed. Your pillow. Your stuff. Your sock. What are you going to do in Petrosavodsk? What? You know this train stops at Petrozavodsk for the night? I know. Will you go out to the city? No. I'll go to bed. Awesome idea! Think about it. I'm going to visit a friend there, you can join me if you like. No, thanks. But why no? You will like her? You like old stuff and she is really old. Like that thing of yours... - The petroglyphs. - Yeah, the petroglyphs. And who is she? Your mom? She's better than mom. Anyway, I'm not interested. So? You sure you want to spend the night in the train? Or at the station? Yes. You're so fucking boring. She's got vodka. And an old Russian stove! And a cat! Babushka, a cat and a stove... Have she got a balalaika? No, no balalaika. I'm not going if there's no balalaika. Good night! Screw you. Come out already. Get out! Mm... What mm? You're not talking to anyone, I know. Look, have a heart! Finally! Please. Hey! What's the problem? She is keeping the phone but she's not talking to anyone... Hello! It's me. I'm here in... Petroskoi. - Are you coming to pick me up? - So now she is talking. - Great! - I need a phone, too. Fuck off, asshole! Why so rude? - Everything fine? - All fine. Your last chance. Are you coming? Let's go. I have everything fixed there. Okay, let's roll! Where did you get the car? I have connections. Just to keep me awake. Where are we going? To Yuri Gagarin. That's Yuri. I've brought some stuff. It's in the kitchen. - Good evening. - You, too, be well! I'll teach you some statistics. I can count the population of Ireland. And you'll see there is more people in Ireland than in China. But how? It's simple. If we consider only the red-headed people as human beings. Why? Just because I want it this way. I'll count only redheads as people. There are lots of redheads in Ireland but none in China. She's red-headed, too. So she will be counted too. You're counted as a human being! There! Okay, I'll go and have a rest. - Go. - And you keep talking. Women... are very clever animals, indeed! There is a small animal inside each woman. You have to learn to live with it and trust it. Do what you inner self tells you. Do not listen to your mom, dad, daughter or husband. - Right. - Women are very clever animals. I was lucky to learn to trust my inner self when I was 15. And I've lived with it happily for 43 years. I do what it tells. To... Love? To love, if you wish so. Oh my! No, let's drink to something more concrete. - Yes. - Now I know! Let's drink to you! That is right, just look. Let's drink to you. Firstly, I hate moonshine. But as I agree to drinking it instead of vodka, let's make the most of it. - Here's to you! - Alright. I hope you get everything you wish in life! To your inner animal. Let's drink! Yuck! It tastes really bad. Shit. Fuck. Hi! We need to go. You've found a good man for yourself. - Yes... - That's it. - Bye! - Bye! You think, I'm a bad guy? Well... I only know what I've seen. What have you seen? Home at last! What's the news? News from Finland. A Finnish man was arrested for cursing in a public place. A foreign tourist traveling to Murmansk has gone missing. She was probably kidnapped and eaten by the Murmansk mafia. - Is that really in the paper? - Yeah! - Can I have a look? - No. - I'll get some tea. You want some? - No. This is not your car. You need a different car. You have a ticket to the 3rd class. And this is the 2nd class. Do you understand? - I don't speak Russian. - I can't... Look, I can't let you in. You are in a wrong car. Gosh! You need a different car. Can I have a tea bag? - Are you cold? - Yes. Thanks. Go away, or I'll kick you out. - Oh, for heaven's sake! - Okay, okay. - Are you, perhaps, from Finland? - Yeah. Hi. Can you help me? I don't know if I'm on the right train. - Murmansk? - Yeah. I didn't understand a fucking thing she said. I'll be getting off before Murmansk. - You don't have a compartment? - No. Well, you can come to ours. - There's this Russian guy and me. - Oh, cool. So, you play guitar. Yeah, a little. Hi! How are you? - Ljoha. - Aloha. Nice bag. It's a cool bag, leather bag. Okay then. Have you been traveling a long time? A couple of months. Alone? Mostly, yeah. Do you ever feel... ...alone Well, I don't know... Everyone's alone. Please, immediately leave the tracks, sir! How long does the train stay here? 40 minutes, you can go out if you like. I'll go outside. I'll come with you. Is everything okay? It looked like it hurt. What? You fell down on the track. I did not fall on the track. I saw you slipping. I didn't slip. We're going for a walk. Want to go with us? It sucks. - What? - This place is dead. Okay. See you. Goodbye. It looked like he had a situation. Hi! - You need something? - I'm not sure. - Drink with us. - The dog came here and so did we. - Hi! - Fucking fate, eh! Come on. Should we get going? My toes are pretty frozen. Here, take it. How much? Take what you can get. - What? - Go ahead, take it. Russian alcohol. - Thanks! - It's a gift. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Thank you! - Welcome! - Bye! - Thanks, cheers! - Cheers! I've brought you something. Fuck off! What did he say? He said... ...he's not thirsty. There must be a factory around here where they make guys like him. Right? Thanks. Bye. Get back in the train! We're leaving soon. - Can I smoke inside? - No! Please. Come in. Thank you. What's wrong? My camera! What happened? Fuck! What's with the camera? He has taken my camera! This asshole! You mean, stole it? Yes! I had my whole Moscow on that tape. All humans should be killed. So what was it like? What? Moscow on the tape. People. Parties. Flats. Laughter. Music... I loved it all... And now I've lost it. So what about thre boyfriend? My boyfriend's name is Irina. She's the most beautiful person I've ever met. We... were supposed to do this trip together. But she had to work. And I went anyway. I don't know why. She has a beautiful life and a beautiful flat like in books. I wanted so badly to be a part of that life, too. To be a part of that flat. Tell me about that flat. It's got... old, beautiful... hardwood floors. High ceilings. And drawings... on the walls... Patterns... Like, paper on the wall. - Wallpaper, eh? - Wallpaper. Wallpaper, right. And... Old furniture that's been in the family for many years. On weekends we used to take long walks. Sometimes we visited museums. In the evenings people would come over. We drank, laugher and talked. Cool. I thought I would miss her more but... honestly... I just miss the way she used to look at me. I'm a terrible person, I should be killed. Alright then! Murmansk is close. Let's celebrate! How? Where? How, where... In the restaurant car, of course. Let's go. Right. - Well! - How can I help you? We don't need help, we need food! So, go ahead. - Champagne and... - Right. And... chicken with potatoes. - Great! - Ran out of it. Okay, then we'll have salmon. No salmon, either. It's the end of the route. Well, what do you have? Caviar? Let me check. Just a minute. I'm sorry, you had to stand me during the whole trip. I've had worse, you know. We can make some sandwiches with cheese and sausage. No warm food, sorry. We'll have sanwiches then. Bring it all here. Go ahead! So... Let's... Let's drink! Dammit. I can't drink this shit. I'll be right back. Just a second, one second. Right... This will do? You know... Look... Okay. Right, thank you. Give it to me.

What is it? - Is this me? - Yes. Looks like me, really. You can draw me, too. No, no! No way! I don't know how to do it. Don't expect too much... - Shit... - Can I see? Well... - Fuck it. - Can I see, please? There's nothing to see. It's not good. Okay... Write me your address. - So we'll be best friends? - Well, just in case. - No need to do that. - What, exactly? No need to do any of this. Why not? You never know what might come around. No... No, I don't want it. It's a stupid idea. - But... - Enough of this crap. Your sandwiches. Shit. Thanks. Is everything okay? Yes. Everything is just perfect. Thank you. - We have arrived. - Yes. Here. I'm afraid nothing is booked on your name. I think, the booking was made by Irina Mezhinskaya. Yes. And where's Ms. Mezhinskaya? She's not coming. Why? Just because. Alright. Bye. Have a good stay. - They burn the sofa... - Assholes! Hello again. - Do you have a question? - Yes. I came here to see the petroglyphs. - You know about them? - Yes, I know. But I'm not exactly sure where they are and how to get there. Can you help me to find a tour guide or something? - Just a second. - Where? There's no way. - Car? - Are you kidding? It'll get stuck there. I'm afraid, it is not possible at the moment. - But why not? - Come back in summer. No, excuse me but I know for sure that it's possible. - My friend... - How? With a road like that? There is no road to that place. Offer her a different tour. But we have other things to offer. "Murmansk the hero-city" tour, very interesting and exciting. - Have a look. - Mm. Thank you. ... of 1941-1945 with little or no loss... And provided coverage of the city and direction of the civil population... The Germans were ready to... - Hello. - I'm looking for a tour guide. - A tour guide? Yes. I want to see... this. - A tour guide... - You know it? - Yeah, yeah. You know, you can't get there. Why? You just can't go there. And where are you from? Finland. Oh I see. That's why you don't know you can't get there by car in winter. Well... Is there any other way? No idea. I guess, scientists get there by helicopter. Archeologists. If you're an archeologist. Hello? Hello? Hi, it's me. Oh, hi! How are you? How's Murmansk? Have you seen the petroglyphs? No. Everyone says it's impossible to get there in winter. It is too far. There is no road. - Mm. - Everything seems to be too far away. I'm sorry to hear that. But there are other things to see here, interesting also. I'm sure there is. Look, I have to go. Anything else you wanted to tell me? What time is it there? What do you mean? Moscow time, it's the same as in Murmansk. Ah, yes, of course it is. - Look, I have to go. Okay? - Okay. Okay. Bye! - Bye! - Bye-bye! - Can I take these? - Yes. Hello? Hello. It's the receptionist. There's someone waiting for you. - Mm. - Bye. - Thank you. Yes. Hi! Okay, let's go! Where? To look at that crap... But they told me it is impossible. Oh! They are lazy bastards, you know. Alright. I need my coat. - Right. - Come on. Get in. He'll take us there. Nice to meet you. - Hi, guys. - Hey! So, listen up. We're heading to... What's it called? - The petroglyphs. - The petroglyphs. - Heard of it? - Yeah. As far as I get it, the only way there now is... By water, but there's a gale warning. I see but it won't take us long, just there and back, you know. She has come from... - Finland. - From Finland. Across the whole country just to have a look at them, petroglyphs. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Yes! - You want to go by sea? - Yes, by sea! - No one will go by sea now. - Why? It's not safe, goddammit! Just yesterday a boat was washed fucking ashore. And the wind had come just the day before. You want another one today? I don't ask you to go to the Arctic Ocean, for fuck's sake! Just go out and move along the shore. Is it hard? Money is not a problem. I'll pay you! Cut the shit, guys. - Where? - The fucking petroglyphs! The fuck I know where! Tell me where. For fuck's sake! - I know where. - He knows! - I do. - Then we'll go with you. - Well, I don't know... - Look. Stop whining... - Ljoha! Ljoha! Ljoha! - We don't need to do this. - Okay, let's go! It's all fixed! That's it? That's it. Have you seen "The Titanic"? Yes! We are like them now. We're gonna die soon, too? Well, Rose didn't die. She did in the end. Later at some point. - Back to the hotel? - Yes. Music? This is from Ljoha. "Haista vittu"
