You scared me. What are you doing? Stop it! - I have to ask you something. - No. Stop it, please. I feel embarrassed. - I have a question. - No. Stop it. I won't talk anymore. Would you marry me? Marry? You have weird ideas. We're way too young. Please put that away. We're way too young. BLOOD TRAIL Become a policeman first. 12 YEARS LATER Back there. She wanted to go swimming. Maybe a heart attack. No signal again. Get her to the bank and we'll get her out. - Great. How? - Swim. Come on. Wonderful. I know her. She works at the castle. - Castle? - Poor thing. Someone has to guard her. It's fine. I can do that. - I'll call someone. - Okay. Are you new? I don't know you. I only came a week ago. So, new and a death right away. I was in Vienna for ten years. It's worse there. I can imagine. Let's have a look. No signs of violence. Cause of death is unknown. What do you think? Heart attack? No, maybe a cramp. - Will the CID come? - Yes. Ready for the autopsy. The letter. Thanks. - See you. - See you. Hello, are you already on the way? We are. Where will we meet? In Brunn an der Wild. They'll take us where the body was found, somewhere in the forest. Alright. See you. It's over there. - Let's have a look. - Hello. - You were on guard? - Yes. - Did anyone come? - Only the doctor. What did she say? The corpse is released. No use of force. - Does she have an ID on her? - We didn't touch her. - Well done. - But I know her. She works at the castle. Where exactly did you find her? She was in the pond. - Probably a bathing accident. - Possible. But policemen assume the worst. Maybe you. We use common sense. It's always helpful to have common sense on your side. She has no ID on her, but the colleague knows where she lives. Where she lived. I'll drive there with the colleagues. - Then I'll drive back. - Anything interesting? Let's wait for the autopsy. - Has the undertaker been contacted? - Yes. - Krems would be best, right? - We will search the surroundings. Have fun. There are worse things. Take care of it. I'll stay in the car. Seeing dead people is no problem, but telling relatives is hard for me. - Fine with me. Who's the owner? - Lanner. - Lanner. Okay. - Thanks. It's fine. Is anyone here? - Miss Lanner? - It smells weird here. Something's burning. What's going on here? What are you doing here? What do you want? Something was burning on the stove. Where's Fanny? My employee must have overlooked this. Who are you looking for? We unfortunately have sad news. - Your employee... - Fanny. Yes. She died, unfortunately. What? She died? She drowned in the pond. She drowned? I see. Yes, unfortunately. - Did she live in the castle? - Yes, of course. Is it okay if I see her room? Fanny's room? Yes. Come along. What did you say? Fanny is dead? - Did Miss Hofstatter have relatives? - Yes. Her nephew. Robert always came when something needed to be repaired. - Is he from Rotweinsdorf? - Yes. Very decent people. Did Miss Hofstatter like swimming? Did she do it often? Daily. Always at 2pm. It was her only pleasure. She was so modest. Sometimes a little rough, but only on the outside. - Hanno, Fanny is dead. - Mum, I heard about it. I was scared something happened to you. No, that's the problem. What will I do now without Fanny? She drowned. She drowned. You know Miss Hofstatter's relatives? Robert. We have to contact the relatives. You can stay in the car. I'll do it. Thanks. I'll handle the paperwork. You owe me one. Yes? The inspector. What a surprise. Hello, Robert. What brings you here? Sit down. This is Martin. I told you about him. - Gabi. - Hello. Do you want to see the new stable? No, I need to talk to you in a professional capacity. Professional capacity? Could we talk in private? I see. Yes. Come. - I'm sorry. - It's fine. - Girl or boy? - A girl. Laura. Tell me it isn't true. Unfortunately it is. She drowned. My condolences. Tell me it isn't true. She can't drown now. I can't change it, Robert. I'm sorry. This can't be true, dammit. Now?! Impossible. Drowned?! Why? Dammit! Your boy? Joseph. Your aunt would have needed it herself. What? The guardian angel. My condolences again. ONE WEEK EARLIER You dirty pests. Would you marry me? Marry? You have weird ideas. We're way too young. Become a policeman first. - You want to live here? - Just for now. Until I find something for us. You already seem depressed. It's fine. It's only temporary. In any case it must be cleaned properly. - I'll help you. - Thanks. - A busy day. - Yes. Can we at least postpone things for now? Trust me, I'd love to, Mr Hofstatter. But I can't. - Maybe you can privately... - I know no rich people. It was bad luck that the milk price dropped so much. It's nobody's fault. The free market is rough. Sometimes even unfair. Get the money somehow. Otherwise we get the farm. I'd rather light it before you get it. Miss Fanny, where have you been so long? I'm not imprisoned here, am I? I work all the time, anyway. Don't be so snotty. I asked politely. - I was swimming. What else? - That's nice. And I took a look at the hunting lodge. There was a hornet nest. We have to do something about it. I know. I already called Robert. May I have my tea? I'm already on my way. You are so grumpy sometimes, Miss Fanny. Although it's such a nice day. Give them a little more. Exactly. That's good. Where have you been? Your aunt called. I had business at the bank. - What did she want? - They have a hornet nest. I'll call her back. - Are you still going to the field? - Yes. May I come along? You'll get bored on the tractor. No. Really. I swear. Fine. Come. Where are the hornets? In the castle? In the hunting lodge, I think. - Dad! - Sure. Come on. I have to go to the office to introduce myself and sort out my locker. Bring something to eat. Something quickly made, like Pizza. POLICE Police? Inspector Wagner. The new one. I called. - Hello. Wagner. - And your first name? - Martin. - Franz. We're on first name terms here. Come. There is no jogging trot for me. We're an active department. Don't do anything stupid in your free time either. Appropriate behaviour. Respectful presence. Don't worry. My wild times are over. Even better. Duty starts tomorrow at 7am. Franz will show you everything. He's an experienced colleague. Cool. Tell me, I feel like I know you. Have we ever met? Twelve years ago. You questioned me. My girlfriend went missing back then. I see. - Monika Steindl. - Steindl. It's been a long time. - Are you from the area? - My mother is. I always went to my grandparents during the holidays. Summer and winter. So you know the area. Good. Alright. To good cooperation. Great. Thanks. Why didn't she come along? She's a teacher in Vienna. In six months she'll get a job in Waidhofen. Then it'll get serious. You can count on that. You want coffee? I can't. We have to clean the house. It's going to be a busy day. Look what's here. Give me that. Go out before they get angry. What a bitch. - What's in it? - That's none of your business. - I have to free them. - Burn them. Not allowed. They're protected. - Protected? - Yes. Aunt, I have to ask you something. Go ahead. When I come back. The kitchen is done. And I am exhausted. - Thanks. - The pizzas are in the oven. We're done for today. Let's eat outside? It's a nice evening. Since we're here... I told you that this won't end well. It was crazy to get those loans. The milk price dropped. If only I had known, things might have turned out differently. - How much do you need now? - 100,000. What? 100,000? What if you don't have it? The farm will go under the hammer. The farm, the forest and the fields. Everything will be gone. We'll be gone. The farm? What does your wife say? She doesn't know yet. I haven't told her. That's better. It would be a shame. Such a shame. Maybe we can ask Miss Lanner whether she can lend it to me. Lanner? In two years I'll be an organic farmer. I can surely pay it back then. I thought that I could talk to her. Explain everything to her. You won't talk to anyone. I'll do that myself. Lock the door. Let's leave. I have to get up early tomorrow. School starts at 8am. We should go inside. Do you think Miss Lanner... I'll handle that. Come here. What is it? A guardian angel. It'll protect you. Mum? I wanted to talk about something with you. I found a very good buyer for the castle. What do you think? Isn't it time? Sell it? Where do you think I would move? Dad's been dead for more than ten years. It's time for us to start fresh. Let's buy you a nice flat in Vienna. Fanny, you once again outdid yourself today. You haven't tried anything yet. I only have to look at it. We had hornets in the hunting lodge. Hornets? But Miss Fanny's nephew, Robert, got rid of them. He relocated them. Hornets mustn't be killed anymore. - It's incredible. - Yes, they're protected. Everyone has gone mad. Where was the nest? In the truss? Behind the boarding. Is this the famous chives sauce? We also have apple horseradish. Hanno, I don't want that. To sell. I want to stay until the end. And what about Fanny if I moved to Vienna? She wouldn't come along. She'd die like a primrose. You don't have to decide right away. It would just be an ideal opportunity. He'd lease me the hunting lodge. Were you serious before? Marrying? I like you, Martin. You know that, right? Will you come next weekend? Then we'll talk about everything, okay? - Now you're back. - I am. Let's go. I just greased them, Doctor. I was looking for it. - Will you stay for the night? - I don't know yet. The room is prepared. That's good. Thanks, Fanny. - You're still fit. - Look who's talking. Wow. Here's the reward. What is it? Who gave you the necklace? - My aunt, Fanny. - May I have a look? It's a guardian angel. It shall protect me. What about it? Nothing. I like it. It's supposed to protect me. I need that. You don't have to look. The hornets were behind it. I have the box. Which box, Miss Fanny? The woman's stuff. The memories. The woman who disappeared. But nobody knows it. I haven't told anyone. - And I won't. - What didn't you tell anyone? That you sometimes met her in the hunting lodge. I saw it once. Not on purpose. She came to you. That bitch. It's good that you didn't tell anyone. Thanks, Fanny. I made a mistake back then. I was already married. To be honest, I was glad when she suddenly disappeared. From one day to the next. She was a bitch. Where is the box? In my room. Nobody knows about it. Good. Give it to me, please. I wanted to ask you something. My nephew, Robert, took over Ludwig's farm. Ludwig? My brother. And Robert built a stable. Gigantic. Way too big. On debts. I wanted to ask you something. You scared me. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it, please. I feel embarrassed. Marry? You have weird ideas. Brunner to Brunner one. Steindl called. She's seeing ghosts again. Steindl? Franz will know. Drive there. We will. We're nearby, anyway. Miss Steindl. We're here now. Where is he? In the shed again? I wanted to get wood and he was there. I'll take a look. Please tell him not to come anymore. Yes. My colleague will protect you here. Is this your daughter, Miss Steindl? Yes. Mona. She sometimes visits me. She visits you? Yes, at the windowsill. She sometimes comes dressed as a bird. She's with God. She's dead? With God. Yes. She died pure. She had a boyfriend, but no sex. She told me. Only God is allowed to take lives. That's why Gunther can't find peace. If only he could find peace. Miss Steindl, we're done. He's gone again. We need to head to the forest pond. You told him not to come anymore? Yes, I did. He promised me. But I'm in a hurry now. A dead body is drifting in the pond. Children found her. Back there. She wanted to go for a swim. Maybe a heart attack. Great. Wonderful. Yes, Mum. I decided spontaneously. But tell Fanny she mustn't cook. I just ate something. You wanted to pay? In half an hour. Bye. Yes, I did. But I just realised that I don't have my wallet. - No credit card, nothing. - I see. Will you be working tomorrow? No. Saturday is my day off. My name is Lanner. Like the composer. The composer? You know Johann Strauss? Yes. Viennese waltz. Exactly. Johann Strauss, Joseph Lanner. I see. Can I take it on credit? I have to ask the boss. - How? - Lanner. - Hello. - Hello. Is there a problem? Did anything happen? Yes, unfortunately. A death. - My mother? - No, an employee. Miss Fanny? I think so. How did that happen? She was a kind-hearted person. A little rough sometimes, but only on the outside. - Hanno, Fanny died. - Mum, I just heard about it. What will become of me now? I was scared something happened to you. No, but that's the point. What will I do now? She drowned. She drowned. You know Miss Hofstatter's relatives? Yes? Inspector, what a surprise. Hello, Robert. Dammit! Are you often out here? Once a week. I own the hunting lodge. A hunter? A compensation for the facts and outcomes that dominate the profession. Yes, one needs a compensation. For me it's music. Especially classic music. Back then the world was still alright. Without music, life would be a mistake. Well said. Who wrote it? - Friedrich Nietzsche. - The philosopher? - The guy who said "God is dead"? - Exactly. But the quote goes on. "God is dead and we killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?" We killed him? We humans? It's your field of expertise. Murder. I don't feel responsible for this case. - Your aunt needed it herself? - What? The guardian angel. Again, my condolences. Dr. Lanner. Arrival at 4:40pm. Smoker. Do we still have the file on Steindl's daughter's disappearance? It should still be there, why? I'm interested. - When was that? - 2010. 2010 is up there. Look around. Hello. Do you remember me? You were in a relationship with Mona. Martin, right? Do you have a moment? I want to ask you something. You're a policeman here now? Ask me. I read your testimony from back then. You told the police she had another one, besides me. Do you know who he was? Was it Robert? Hofstatter? Definitely not. She told me he was from Vienna. From Vienna? He sometimes came here and she met him. Did she tell you his name or his job? No, she didn't tell me. He mainly lives in Vienna, but for some reason also often here. I don't know more. Do you still think about her? I thought it was all over. Or done. But... Since I'm back... Everything's coming back up. She felt bad about cheating on you. She loved you. I know that. So why did she do it? Forget her, Martin. It's been so long. Let's hope she's doing fine. Let's hope she's doing fine. Good evening, Doctor. - Hofstatter. I'm Fanny's nephew. - Yes, of course. How terrible, Mr Hofstatter. All of us are shocked. My sympathies. - What a tragedy. - Thanks, Doctor. - I wanted to talk to your mother. - What is it about? Fanny said she could lend me money. My mother? I'd be surprised. She has no money. Everything we have goes into this dreadful castle. Could you ask her anyway? I'll do it with pleasure, Mr Hofstatter. But only tomorrow. She's sleeping now. Thank God. This tragedy hit her badly. Yes? No, I wouldn't have expected that. Where are you? I'm coming in 20 minutes. Traces on the throat, under the skin. Someone pushed her underwater. A big hand. Probably a man. Right-handed. She died between quarter past two and quarter to three. That's all I got. - Did she fight back? - No. No signs for that. Weird. - A murder. Didn't look like it. - Not really. - Do you have anything useful? - Not really. A fresh cigarette butt, but it's hard to pin down from when. - Are you going there right now? - Yes. My husband was sick for a long time. Cancer. We looked for a nurse and Fanny came. It's been 15 years. She nursed him with so much love. Until the end. He died in the house. Otto left. Fanny stayed with me. Didn't she have friends? Did she never have visitors? Her nephew, Robert, sometimes. But she was only there for me. That was her whole life. It will be tough to find a replacement. Fanny can't be replaced. We'll sell the castle and I'll move to Vienna. - Were you planning that? - No. I wanted to stay until the end. I thought Fanny would take care of me like she took care of Otto. When the time comes. She was way younger. Would your son be okay with selling the castle? He told me how much hunting means to him. No, he has a buyer who'll lease him the hunting lodge. How lucky to find a buyer this quickly. He was looking for a long time. But I didn't want it. I wanted to stay here. With Fanny. The room is ready. When will the CID come? - They will come. - I would've never thought that. It looked like a normal bathing accident. Sometimes it's different than it looks. Mr Hofstatter? Yes? - Paul Werner, CID St. Polten. - Hello. You know why I'm here? - But you probably have an idea. - No. I don't know. No idea. Stefanie Hofstatter was your aunt, right? Fanny. Yes. She was killed. Fanny? But she drowned. It only looked like that. Murdered? When was the last time you saw her? - Last Tuesday. - Where? Here. She wanted to see the stable. Why? She had never seen it before. She must have been very impressed. - Is that a milking robot? - Yes. And the cows go there voluntarily? Yes, they like it. It's like looking into the future. It must have cost a fortune. These days there is no other way. Joseph or Laura should also profit from it. - Your children? - Yes. Impressive, Mr Hofstatter. Thanks. Can you come to the Brunn department tomorrow at 10am? I'd like to take your statement. I can do that. See you tomorrow. Thanks, Mr Hofstatter. Hello, Rudi. It's me. Paul Werner. I am investigating a murder in the forest district and require approval for an account opening. Do you have a pen and paper? Yes, I'll wait. Thanks. Yes? - Do you need anything else? - No, thanks. - I'd call it a day. - That's fine. Thanks. Tell me, how well do you know Mr Hofstatter? Very well. We've been friends since childhood. You know you can't tell him anything about the investigations? Sure. - Can I count on it? - You can. Good. Enjoy your evening. I still hope he somehow gets it privately. He's a good guy. Do I understand correctly? The whole farm is about to be put up to auction? - The family will have to leave? - All of it is collateral. A tragedy, of course. Did you know that I always envied you? Who did you envy? Your family. You lived on your own farm, did everything together. As a child it seemed like a great life. It isn't as simple as it looks. A child's fantasy. - Do you remember Mona? - Sure. I keep thinking about her since I'm back. Why did she cheat on me? With whom? And why did she leave? I even thought you had something going on with her back then. Me? Because of the necklace. - I'm going crazy. - What necklace? Your aunt's. Mona had the same. I gave it to her. I'd love to know where she went. How she's doing. That I can be finished with it. I already have a bad conscience because of Iris. As if I cheated on her. - Hello. - Hello, Robert. - I'm supposed to testify. - In the back. Come. - Mr Hofstatter is here. - Yes, please. - Hello. - Hello. I don't understand why your aunt had no social contacts. No friends, no lover. That's true. Fanny was peculiar. - Has she always been? - Yes. Always. I just know her like that. Do you smoke? No. Who do you think killed her? - I don't know. - No assumption? No suspicion? Who would do such a thing? Fanny never harmed anyone. How did you finance the stable? The bank, I know. But you also need a co-pay to get a loan. My father's money, my savings and we sold the forest. Your aunt helped you as well? Yes. She still had the money from the cash out of the farm heritage. Did she want her money back? No. Fanny didn't need money. - She was modest. - She just gave it to you? We agreed that she'd live with us once she'd stop working. To take care of her when business is running. So? Is it running? Yes, things will be fine. In two years I'll be organic. Then I'll get more for the milk. Then it'll work. Where were you on Friday from 2pm to 3pm? On the field, making feed. - Did anyone see you? - My boy Joseph was with me. - Police. - Dr Lanner. Hello. The colleague from CID wanted to talk to me. I see. First floor. We have to sign the protocol within the next few days. I'll call you. - Thanks for coming. - No problem. - See you. - See you. - Bye. - Bye. Yes? Dr Lanner is here. From the castle. You told him to come. - He's here? - He's waiting outside. Do you have cigarettes? - I don't smoke. - Are there any in the office? Get an ash tray and a lighter. But he mustn't realise. Okay. Doctor. I'm glad you've come. My mother told me. An interrogation, I assume. Just a questioning. You are not suspect. I thought about what you told me. I see. "God is dead and we killed him." What did Nietzsche mean? You're into philosophy now? I can't get it out of my head. I think, to him it was about us having lost all moral instances. Because we grew out of the childish believe. - Does it disturb you? - No. It is prohibited in public buildings. - May I, too? - Sure. So Nietzsche was an atheist? Yes. But a desperate one. What does that mean? For our purpose in life? For our ethics? When God disappeared? - That's what he thought about. - So? What does it mean? A new human is needed. One who makes his own moral laws. Autonomously and free. Nietzsche called it the Ubermensch. Now I will have to think about that. One could think about it for a lifetime. - You'll sell the castle? - Yes. Thank God. Your mother told me about it. She told me she didn't want it. Yes, but now we lost Fanny. She understands that it can't keep going on like this. The costs are enormous. Now I'm suspicious, I assume. - Why? - I'd have a motive. - I wanted to sell the castle, but... - I see what you mean. You can sell, as Fanny is no longer alive. - Exactly. - I don't think that's a motive. It would be one. Money problems. Greed. - Do you have money problems? - No. You see? But just for the protocol, what did you do on Friday, between 2pm and 3pm? The time of death? Let's see. I left the office at noon sharp. I went home, showered and got changed. Then I read and left. It was about 2pm. Was anyone at home? Unfortunately not. The maid had her day off and my wife was somewhere. You left at 2pm. How long does the ride take? - An hour and a half? - Approximately. But you arrived at the castle at 4:40pm. Why do you know that? I looked at my watch. - I had lunch on my way. - Where? At Buchinger's in Harmannsdorf. Quite recommendable. - Will you check it? - I have to. Thanks for coming, Doctor. And for the food for thought. Yes? - I just remembered something. - Yes? I'm afraid I was caught speeding on my way home. I was a little too fast. Right behind Maishauer. Somewhere there. So you can calculate when I left Vienna. What's your registration number? Vienna. FN1889. - A vanity plate? - Yes. What does FN1889 mean? Find it out. You're the criminologist. Hello, Doctor. My aunt gifted me this necklace. She said it would protect me. It was Mona Steindl's. A friend of mine told me. How did your aunt get it? It was in the hunting lodge, I think. - Behind the panelling. - You think so? I'm pretty sure. Who put it there? - Did your aunt suspect anyone? - She didn't talk about it. Did you tell anyone about your ideas? And you shouldn't. That would be slander. That's a crime, Mr Hofstatter. I thought you came to talk about the loan again. Yes, he ate here. Friday afternoon. Why are you so sure? I even know his name. Johann Strauß, like the composer. - No, the other one. - Lanner. - Exactly. Him. - A regular? - No. - Why do you know his name then? He told me about five times. A chatterer. One remembers them. What do you mean, a chatterer? First he had no money and wanted to take it on credit. Then the money was in the car. A lot of fuss for nothing. I know those people. - Do you want anything? A coffee? - Thanks. Leaving pond at 4:18pm. Speed camera B4, 4:51pm. About 30 minutes. - Unfortunately not. - No? No match with the cigarette at the pond. Sorry. - A suspect? - No idea. He has an alibi, but I think it could be constructed. Let's do it all then. We have nothing against him. All I have is a weird feeling. Your weird feelings are right most of the time. I don't even have a motive. Did she know something she shouldn't have? Did she blackmail him? With what? If you need anything... One more question. Did your aunt know about the problems with the farm? What do you mean? That you couldn't pay the debts. That everything will go under the hammer. How do you know? I looked into your account. Did she know? How did she react? She said it was a shame. Does your wife share that opinion? - She doesn't know. - Why not? It's bad enough if one person can't sleep. It's my responsibility. My shame. Why did you tell your aunt then? I thought she could ask Miss Lanner whether she could lend it to me. Did she? Why not? Fanny said she had no money. You'll have to tell your wife soon. Inspector, I have a question. A friend disappeared a long time ago. - How long ago? - Twelve years ago. Boy. I wondered whether one could investigate. I'm interested. Privately. Twelve years? We won't find her anymore. I thought so. Sorry. Is that the file? I can take a look. Please put it on my desk. Did she tell you about her nephew's debts? He's in deep trouble. No. Really? The farm is about to go under the hammer. She didn't tell you? - No, she didn't. - They'll lose everything. I'm sorry. They're such decent people. Maybe I can help them. For Fanny. Now that we sell the castle, I have money. I'll talk to my son. Inspector, you're back at ours? I talked to your mum. - How is she doing? - She seems composed. And you? Do you already have a suspect or a lead? Unfortunately not. Nothing makes sense. Maybe it was murder for no reason. A psychopath who walked by, by chance. Yes. That's what it looks like. They're hard to find. By the way, your riddle was way easier. My riddle? FN, Friedrich Nietzsche. 1889, his breakdown in Turin. A horse was slayed and the great philosopher couldn't bear it. He got crazy. A nursing case. How did you find out? Child's play. - Two minutes on a search engine. - Congratulations. Why this registration number? Maybe as an homage. Or a warning. A warning? Not to think too much. I'm afraid I don't get that. He wanted the Ubermensch so much. Rational and self-determined. Without empathy. And then he broke down, just because an animal was slayed. He couldn't withstand his own thinking. That's how you interpret it? Interesting. Very sympathetic, to be honest. Very human. Are you worried, Hanno? - Worried? - Yes. I might be a little nervous, you're right. I'll go to the forest. I'm a little late. - I'm sorry. - No problem. In two days you'll get it in cash. We'll meet here. 2pm. - You did as agreed? - Sure. You didn't tell anyone? Not even your wife? She doesn't know anything about it. Good. Come by bike again. And please don't put on such a loud jacket. You don't need to be seen from ten kilometres away. And don't forget the necklace. How was the family home? Simple people. Very strict. Sie wouldn't tell them about a boyfriend. And then she had two. We won't find her after such a long time, unless she reappears on her own. Yes, I thought so. Does anyone know who was the other guy? She might have run away with him. That happens often. Maybe abroad. - Apparently he was from Vienna. - From Vienna? How do you know? The file doesn't mention that. - Hello? - Paul Werner. CID St. Polten. - Yes? - May I speak to you? Yes. Yes, please. Everything you remember. Every detail. Was he rich? Did she mention anything? Yes, that's possible. I think she said that money wasn't an issue for him. How old was he? Same age? Older? What do you think? - I think he was older than her. - Why do you think so? He did things that... I think one has to be older for that. He humiliated her. Sexually. How did she feel about it? Did she like it? She didn't understand herself. She said: I'm usually not like that. But she couldn't get away from it. She wanted to end it again and again, but she couldn't. Why didn't you tell the police back then? She hadn't wanted that. Definitely not. Thanks. One more question, do you know where your friend met that lover? Did she imply anything? Yes. In the forest. She once said she'd meet him in the forest. In the forest? Yes. I asked her, but she didn't want to say more. She only laughed. Thanks. You helped me a lot. Are the missing woman's parents alive? The mother is. You'll drive. Tell me about her. - What do you want to know? - What's the first thing you remember? The last time I saw her, I proposed. And? She wanted to think about it. Then she disappeared. And I found out there was another guy. That... It was tough. I didn't think Mona would do that. Yet I'd love to know where she went. Whether she's alive. How she's doing. Just so that I can get it out of my head. Properly. Did you change anything in the room? Nothing. For a long time I thought she'd come back. - May I look around? - Go ahead. Mona has been with God for a long time. Have you ever been here? It's weird, seeing how she lived. Was your friend interested in philosophy? I don't know. I don't think so. Why? Is that philosophy? "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", Friedrich Nietzsche. Will you stay for the night? No. Unfortunately I have a board meeting tomorrow morning. I'll come back the day after tomorrow. You seem to be in a rush, Hanno. That's possible. These are difficult times, don't you think? - I do. - A lot to get through. A lot to think about. Can you still find DNA on a book after twelve years? We can. Whose? Lanner's. - As quickly as possible. - The day after tomorrow. I think I've got him. Good morning. You have it? - Around noon. - Call me when it's ready. I'm going there already. I'll need you at the hunting lodge. Probably a crime scene. - Do you have a search warrant? - I'll get it with the DNA test. You're that sure? That sure. - Is my wife at home? - No, not yet. Please tell her I went to the castle. I'll come this evening. See you. - Hello. - Hello. Chief Inspector. - Did you find out something? - Maybe. Do you think she's still alive? I'm not sure. A match? Very good. I'll call the prosecutor. We'll meet at a hunting lodge. The colleagues in Brunn will show you the way. - I think I'll ride my bike. - Now? - Isn't it too hot? - It's okay. Yes. Come on. I'll be back around three. Police. Hello. I want to report a burglary. First floor, please. Surprise. - I thought you'd come tomorrow. - Surprise. - How long do you have to work today? - 6pm. Will you give me the house key? I'd like to cook something. But I haven't cleaned up yet. Mr Lanner? - What are you doing here? - I followed you. Was it supposed to look like a hunting accident this time? I think I don't understand you. A bathing accident with your employee. A hunting accident with Mr Hofstatter. Confused with a deer. That can happen. With a good lawyer you get involuntary manslaughter. Better than a charge for murder. Are you saying I killed Fanny? - Yes, I think so. - Can you prove it? No. Probably not. But I think I can prove you murdered Monika Steindl. In the hunting lodge where you always met her. Maybe it wasn't murder. Not planned. In affect. Emotions impair the brain. Uncontrollable feelings. I guess I underestimated you. Am I right? You didn't plan it? Rather manslaughter. It was an accident. Not planned. I loved her. - You won't lose your nerve again? - Turn around. You won't get away with it, Mr Lanner. It's over. I told you to turn around. Hands up! Dr Lanner? Hello, Mr Hofstatter. I know, you expected someone else. He won't come. Was it about your debts? You should talk to his mother. But now tell me everything you know. What do you mean? Why Mr Lanner wanted to kill you. What do you know? What did he want? You were lucky. Luckier than your aunt. Let's sit down. What do you want to know? What you know about Monika Steindl's disappearance. And what your aunt knew. Where is that necklace now? You know that it's a crime to not report a suspected crime? I'll record it as an anonymous tip. You need a good reason for the meeting with Mr Lanner at the hunting lodge. It could have been about a necessary repair. Hello. We're looking for Steindl's DNA. She was killed in the hunting lodge. Okay. You stay here? No, I'll go to the car and drive to the office. I'll get the warrant and start the manhunt. Yes, we'll handle this. See you. Does this have to do with Mona? She had an affair with Dr Lanner. They always met here in the hunting lodge. It was him? What happened to her? She was probably killed. Here, in the hunting lodge. He killed her? Why? She wanted to break up and end the relationship. It seems like he couldn't bear it. Okay. What are you doing here? I had to repair something. Did you hear it? Now I finally know. After so many years. Was that a shot? Somewhere down there. - And you'll find the place? - Yes. I'll come along. Are you a good shoot, Mr Wagner? Come along, please. The suspect? Case solved. Congratulations. Pure luck. There are a lot of cigarette butts. It looks like he was a regular around here. Will we find another corpse here? Some kind of grave? Yes, maybe. Clever. We need to bring in a police dog. Do you still need me? Not today. The next few days. I'll call. Inspector. Thanks. Call Miss Lanner. In a week or ten days. I think she will help you. Mr Wagner? Sorry. Go to your car and call a medical officer when you feel ready. Sorry that I let myself go on duty. No problem. It's fine. - It was a lot today, right? - Yes. What took you so long? Now I'm here. Now I'm here.
