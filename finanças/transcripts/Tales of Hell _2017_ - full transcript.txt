[static hisses] [intense electronic music] - Do you wanna watch another? - I honestly feel like we've seen everything. - We haven't seen everything. - Seriously, the entire catalog run through. Netflix, we're done with. [woman laughs] I'm on that verge of going, let's chill. - No. [laughs] - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. We literally have nothing else to watch. - We could watch one more. - If you say Bee Movie, I swear to God. [woman laughs] You're doing it again. [dramatic music] [tape rattles] Did you hear that? - Do you wanna? - I'll check it. - [Woman] Yeah, you go check. - All right, I'll go check. [dramatic piano music] - [Woman] What does it say? - [Man] Tales of Hell. - No, I don't really wanna watch a horror. - Come on, it could be good. - No, I don't think it's the right sort of. - Seriously, how often to you get, like, a tape come through. - I know, but. I dunno. - Let's do it. Just wanna have a look. - Okay, all right. All right fine. But, okay, fine. - All right, have a look. I know you're not in the mood but it could be fun. - Okay. [static hisses] [water rushing] [lights buzzing] [ominous electronic music] - Hello? Hello? [dramatic music] [keys clink] Jesus! Get a grip, Miranda. [ominous music] [floor creaking] [woman gasps] Fuck! [television chattering] [phone buzzing] [dramatic music] [woman yelps] Come on, please! [woman gasping] Is anybody there? [dramatic music] [woman screams] [intense orchestral music] [keys jingling] [lock clicks] [dramatic music] [woman screams] [dramatic electronic music] - She's 24, 25, one of the night managers, Caucasian. - I'm Detective Harris. - Detective Cordova, nice to meet you, sir. - You first on the scene? - Yes. She's in here, sir. - All right. Call the coroner. - He's on his way. - Okay. Ah geez. That's a shame. - You know her? - Yeah. Lauren Deakin. Just 24 years old. Works on human resources here. - How do you know all that? - I was here last night, following up on a harassment case. - Wait, she was being harassed? - No, not her. Another employee, Stacey Newman. She just took the original report. - Okay. - Nice girl. - What the hell happened here then? - I don't know. She was here alone when I left. Manager locked up behind her. - So nobody could've got in or out then? - Nobody except her. Heard the manager tell her to use her set of keys when she left. Manager still here? - Yeah, she had your card on her that's how I knew who to call. She's in the office over there. Pretty shaken up. [somber piano music] - I know it's not the best time but I need to ask you some questions about last night. - I don't wanna talk about last night. I mean, I don't understand. She was fine. I left her last night and she was fine! - You couldn't have know something like this was gonna happen. - But I should've. With everything that's been going on around here, I should've known better. - She try to call you last night? - I don't know. I couldn't get reception, my phone was acting up. - No calls, no voicemail? - Like I said, my phone wasn't working. - All right. Let's try to lock down everybody's whereabouts from last night. I don't suppose anybody else might've been working after hours? - After six on a Friday? Not likely. But, there are other departments and they have keys, so, I can't be sure. - Can you give me a list of all the employees who have keys? - I can try. - Can you think of anybody who might've wanted to hurt her? Somebody new in her life, a boyfriend, girlfriend? Anything like that? - Nobody she talked about. If she did I didn't know. - All right. What do you know about the Stacey Newman harassment case? We're trying to track her down. - Not much, just... She claimed that somebody was following her. - That's something. Thanks for answering my questions. You have my card, if you need anything you don't hesitate to call me. - Okay. Detective. - Hmm? - Nevermind. - I'd like to look at your close circuit TV footage. Might be something there. - It's in the back. Take whatever you need. - Thanks. [dramatic orchestral music] Thanks. Where are we on Stacey Newman? - Phone's been disconnected. Got the number of a long distance relative but nothing to go on yet. - Keep trying, will ya? Hey, can you give me a list of all the employees? - Yes, sir, will do. You heading out? - Yeah. [keys jingling] [door slams] [light piano music] [moves into intense orchestral music] [dramatic music] [phone ringing] - Harris. - [Cordova] You're not going to believe this, detective. - What? - I sent a couple of officers out to the dock for a secondary sweep, get this, we found another body. - Where? - Hidden in the trash on the dock. The body's fresh. We're trying to ID the guy now. He's got a distinctive tattoo on his left forearm. Find anything on those tapes? - I don't know. I'm on my way. [keys jingle] [dramatic music] [engine revs] [dramatic music] [static hisses] [fabric ripping] [upbeat electronic music] [women giggling] - Hey, where are you going? Was there something wrong with my face? What, do I have to drive a nice car to connect with you? - No, it's 'cause you have a penis. [upbeat electronic music] [women laughing] [sultry electronic music] [loud rock music] [sultry electronic music] [woman moans] [sultry electronic music] [woman moaning] [sultry electronic music] [woman moaning] [light buzzing] [wind whooshing] [lock rattling] [door creaks] [dramatic music] [chain rattles] [dramatic music] [music box tinkles] [light buzzing] [music box tinkling] [box clicks] [dramatic music] [light buzzing] [dramatic music] [woman yelps] [dramatic music] [flesh ripping] [woman thuds] [light buzzing] [water splashing] [drawer rattles] [dramatic electronic music] [scissors snapping] [dramatic music] [woman moans] [dramatic music] [woman screams] [woman moaning] [woman screams] [scissors thudding] [dramatic electronic music] [woman huffing] [dramatic piano music] [intense electronic music] [static hisses] [spooky music] [woman moans] - Quiet, Jonathan, we don't want to wake up your father. - Sorry, mom. [man snores] Why do we always have to do this in here, mom? I have a room or we could to the hotel. - With what money are you going to get a hotel room? We both know you don't work. Plus, I can't have your father thinking I'm sleeping around. If he looked at his credit card bill and saw that I'd been staying in a hotel. Plus, your little brother's right in the next room. - You could always pay the hotel in cash. - [scoffs] I can't go throwing money around. I have to take care of you and your little brother. You know your father isn't working. - I just, I wanna be with you without it having to be a secret. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, mommy. I love you. - Mommy loves her little Johnny. But it won't work. Not while your father and brother are still alive. - But Kyle is nine. I can practically raise him myself. - Yeah, but don't you want to live your life? Don't you want to enjoy it and have fun? - I want to be with you. [lips smacking] - Go to your room, John. I'll be in, in a minute to tuck you in. [wood creaking] [bottle crumples] - Susan. Where are you going? - God, I just got up to go to the bathroom, Stanley. - This side of the bed is cold. It's like nobody's been there all night again. It's cold, Susan, ice cold. - What do you want me to say to you, Stan? What do you want me to say? That I was at a hotel fucking some guy? Would it make a difference? Would anything I say make a difference to you at this point? - I still love you. - Wow. Well, you probably should have thought of that before you fucked your secretary. - I quit that job for you, Susan. Just come back to bed, okay? - No. No, I'm going to go make a cup of coffee. Do you want anything? - Yeah I do. I want my wife back. - Well, that ship has sailed. Go back to sleep, Stanley. - You know you look like you've been with another man. - What if I had? What if I had? - Would you just fucking come back to bed, Susan? Just come back to bed. [Susan stomping] [doorknob rattles] - [John] Mom? What's wrong? What's wrong? - It's your fucking father. [sniffles] He treats me like shit. I just wish I could be rid of him and your brother. I just wanna live my life. I just wanna be free. - So do I, mom. - Do you really mean that, Johnny? - Of course. You can get a divorce. Then you and I can run away together. They way things are today no one would ever know that you're my mom. They'll just think that you have a really young boyfriend. - You know, Sigmund Freud said that every boy wants to kill his father and make love to his mother. And you've made love to me, Johnny. [John laughs] Are you ready to pay the price for that love? - What do you mean? - You would never. - Never what? - You don't wanna know. - Come on, tell me. I'd do anything just to have you. [Susan exhales deeply] - Do you love me, Johnny? - You know I do, mom. - Do you love your father? - Of course. - What about your brother? - Of course. - But you love me the most, right? - You know I do, mom. I love you more than anything. - Would you kill them for me? [John laughs] - What? - Would you? Will you kill them for me? - Mom, Kyle is nine. - He's not even your fucking brother. - What do you mean? - Your father knocked up his secretary and the bitch left him with a baby. That is not my son. - That doesn't mean he deserves to die. - I just wanna be free. - No, this isn't the way. - I thought you said you loved me, Johnny. - You can get a divorce. - And risk losing everything? - If I do this I can lose everything! - Then you have to do it right, Johnny. I thought you said that you would do anything to be with me. You said that. - Yeah, but not this. No. [doorknob clicks] - Mom. - Don't call me that. - Mom, can you make me breakfast? - Do not call me that. My name is Susan. - But why, mommy? - Don't fucking call me mommy, my name is Susan. We've been over this. - Sorry. Think about it. - Yes, mom. - How come he gets to call you mom? - Because he's my son and I love him. - So am I. - Mm-mm. You are the son of a whore that ruined this entire family. So, do you want breakfast or not? - [Kyle] Okay, mommy. - [Susan] Think about it. [fist thuds] Hey. - Hey. Wow, what is that about? - I've been doing a lot of thinking, and you are right, you are right, we really, really need to work this out. - [Stanley] Really, Susan? Really? - Yes, yes! Really. Really, really. - I have to go to school. [door slams] [low intense music] [John huffing] [door clicks] [John huffing] - Mommy loves her Johnny. [water rushing] [dishes clang] [Susan sobs] [Susan screams] [water rushing] [light knocking] - [John] Mom, it's John. Mom. [knocks] Mom, are you in there? Mom. [rapid knocking] Mom! [rapid knocking] Mom, open up! [John knocking] Mom! [droning ambient music] - Are you okay, baby? [door creaks] - [Kyle] Mommy! - Where's Johnny? - The incident was really hard on him, babe. The paramedics had to rip him off of you. He's been in his room ever since this happened. He's been locked up in there for, like, weeks. Had to try to get him some food and he seems to be eating it but he won't come out and talk to me. You know how hard this must be on a kid. Watching his mom go through something like this. - Johnny's in his room then? - -[Stanley] Yeah. - Okay. [rapid knocking] Johnny? It's me. - Mom. I'd thought I'd never see you again. I'm so glad you're okay. Why are you holding a knife? - [Susan] Go lay down, Johnny, I'm going to tuck you in. - Okay. [door slams] - I love you, Johnny. - I love you too, mom. - No you don't. - Why would you say that? - I don't know. I'm just upset. - What, is it my fault? - No. No, it's not your fault. Unless you consider that I gave you an option to help me escape and you wouldn't do it so I had to explore other options. - Mom, what are you saying? - I'm saying that, because you won't get rid of your father and brother so we can be together maybe we can be together in heaven, like Romeo and Juliet. - I don't want you to die, mom. - It's the only way. - Maybe there's another way. - But I thought you said you wouldn't do it. - If it's to keep you alive. If it's to keep you alive I will. - Oh, good boy. Good boy. Good boy. [John moaning] [dramatic music] [drawer rattles] [wine splashing] [glasses clinking] - I was thinking we could get a sitter tomorrow night, go to a fancy dinner, just you and me. - Don't you think it's a little last minute for a sitter? - John's almost 17 he could watch Kyle. He's old enough. - Yeah. [John yells] - What the fuck are you doing, John? - [John] I love you, mom! [Stanley yells] - John, what the fuck are doing? - I'm sorry, mom made me do it! - [Stanley] John! [knife whishes] [Stanley thuds] - [John] Dad! [John sobbing] [Stanley coughs] - Help me. Help me. I'm losing. - Well, finish him! Do it! - No, I can't. I can't. - Help me. - Do I have to do everything myself? [Stanley screams] - No, dad! [John sobbing] Dad. I'm sorry, dad. - It's not finished yet. [John gasps] [John thuds] [intense electronic music] - I love you, mommy. - I love you too, baby. [intense electronic music] [static hisses] [dark electronic music] [moves into ominous electronic music] - You made it. Awesome. - Yes, I made it. Screaming and cursing all the way. - I'm glad you decided to come. It's a tough thing to admit, needing help. - I need help, that's for sure. - Ben's a great guy. He's knows firsthand about the recovery. You can trust him. - I don't do good with other people. - You do fine at the store. You'll be fine. - Okay. Let's do it. - Hannah, so glad you made it. - [Hannah] Never miss a meeting, Ben. - That's what I like to hear. - [Ben] Natalie? - [Natalie] Guilty as charged. - [Ben] Sorry about our meeting place. The old street theater is the only place in town that supports us for the moment. There were, at one time, about 10 different groups but now there's just us. The rest cease to exist. Their members stopped coming. - [Natalie] It's okay. Really, it is. - Good evening, everyone. Welcome to another meeting of the Resurrection Survivors. I see we have a few returning faces here, as well as a guest. Right. Okay, as always let's go around and introduce ourselves, if we want to. You can use your real name or create an alias. I think most of you know my story, so I'll go last. Claire, would you like to start us off? - I'm Claire. I watched my boyfriend turn after he got bit and eventually watched him follow the pack. Before that, though, I fought hard for my life. He tried so many times to get at me. I had to... Sever my own arm off after he bit me just because of the fear of turning into one of them. Remember then... Days later when we were told that not everyone who was bit turned, so did I cut my own arm off for nothing? Would I have been safe? - I'm Jerry. Damn, I'm sorry, I busted in on you, didn't I, Claire? - No, I'm done, really. - Sure? Just making sure. Anyway, I wasn't really affected by the undead, zombies, slow walkers, whatever they call them. No, I didn't lose anyone. I didn't kill anyone. I was involved with the disposing of all those bodies. The stench. Damn. - Go ahead, Gale. - I'm Gale. I'm here because I had to shoot my sister after she was attacked by one of those rot bags, as they call them. - It's okay. - It's not okay. It's not like one of those old horror movies, this is real life! We were getting ready for our yearly trip, you know? The kids were at my mother's. It was just Amy and me. Remember when people used to do normal thing? But it was just like Claire said, I thought she'd turn. I mean, that's what happens, right? - They never could find a reason why some did and some didn't. My guess is we aren't meant to know. - Hannah. You all know me. I defended my neighborhood for two weeks straight. I guess killing off all those I got to know over the years kinda took its toll on me. Some called me Superwoman but I don't like that. I just did what I had to do. - Thanks, Hannah. Would you like to share anything? - Let's see. I'm Natalie. I'm a veterinarian. Was. Now I work in Hannah's little hardware shop. I just started a few days ago. I guess you could say she's my sponsor. Anyway, I quit being a vet because I had a breakdown. Right. So I'm here. I'm here because I watched my dead, one-year old daughter climb out of her grave. - No shit. - Yeah, real shit. Real, real shit. - And here I am going on about hauling dead bodies. I can't even imagine. - God, Nat, you told me you just had a loss in your family. You didn't tell me it was this. - No, I couldn't. I can't even get anyone to talk to me anymore. Everyone knows what happened. When she died everyone treated me like I had a disease. This is almost worse. - What did you do? - What could I do? I couldn't bring myself to kill her. So I watched as she joined the pack. She almost crawled, like she was still a baby. It's so hard losing a child once to illness. But a second time? Like this. [Natalie sighs] I really lost it. Really. I did. My husband left me. Probably for the best. - I think you'll fit right in with us, Natalie. - Where do the packs go? Does anyone have any ideas? - We really don't know what happened to all of the undead, do we? I mean, we do know that thousands of bodies were disposed of properly but what about those we didn't find? Those we didn't hunt down and kill? Yeah. Where did some of them go? - I read somewhere where some people took 'em in as pets, you know? - That's messed up. - Fucked up. - I heard the same thing as well. - The world will never be the same. It'll always be fucked up. No matter how much we rebuild, restructure, rearrange our lives. We've changed for good. - If there's anything I can do. - I could use some more company. It was a lot to take in. - Yeah, why don't we hit that coffee shop over there? - No, let's head over to my place. It's so hard to get good people back into my life. - Yeah, people have changed. It's not like it was. [door creaks] - It's not very much but-- - Better than what I have. - [Natalie] Any preference for coffee? - Whatever you have as long as it's hot. - That I can do. - So, you found the group helpful? - Very. - Considering that the Resurrection only lasted a few weeks. It's going to take a lifetime to undo the harm. - I still wonder where all the undead went though. Think about it. - I know. Most just vanished. - I don't like the idea of people keeping them as pets. - Maybe not as pets. More like keeping their loved ones close by. - Come again? - Think about it. If you could not bring yourself to kill your loved one what would you do? - They were dead to begin with. - Right, but could you really bring yourself to kill them? - Good point. I can't imagine what it was like watching your daughter crawl away to join the rest of them. - That's what I have this group for. [coffee drips] - I'll get my coffee. - No, really, I can. [dramatic music] - I thought you said you'd never been to a group like ours. - Dammit. Looks like I forgot to take out the trash. - [Ben] There were at one time about 10 different groups but the rest just ceased to exist. Members stopped coming. - Maybe not as pets. More like keeping your loved ones close by. If you could not bring yourself to kill your loved one what would you do? [pan thuds] [Hannah yelps] [Hannah thuds] Shut up, Hannah! It's still her nap time. [giggles] Maybe I am crazy. Maybe I just love my family. [laughs] I'm so happy for these therapy groups. I have had such a hard time finding people who understand my issues. [snickers] How else could I get them in here for her? She has to eat. - Please no, don't do this! For the love of God. - God? [laughs] I don't believe in his love. However, I do believe in the love I have for my daughter. And that will never die. [Hannah screams] [Hannah thudding] [door slams] [intense electronic music] [Hannah screams] [Hannah moaning] [dramatic music] [child growling] [Hannah yelps] [child growling] [Hannah screaming] [child munches] [film flickers] [static hisses] [ominous ambient music] [glove box clicks] - It's just a bag. It's not important. Set in motion there is no stopping the unstoppable. Stop. This is not where we are going. [locks click] [ominous ambient music] [glove box clicks] Stop the car, now! - No. We are not there yet. [ominous music] [leaves crunching] [ominous music] Stop! Put it down! [gun blasts] [man thuds] [ominous music] [man thuds] [static hisses] [somber piano music] [car revving] [tires screech] [somber piano music] [doors slams] - Thank Christ. - I wouldn't thank him yet, man. - Guys, I really need your help. I fucked up big this time. - That is really not a very good opener, Jeremy. Why don't you cut to the chase because I got Daisy back watching the bar and you know I hate that fucking crazy bitch. - Man, seriously, I'm tripping out right now. I don't know what the fuck to do. - Just, seriously, Jeremy, calm down. You know we've got your back. I got you. - Why don't we wait and see what the situation is before you say you have his back, bro? - Probably better off if I just show you guys. - Well, that sounds-- - Come on. - Oh my god! Jeremy, you have to be fucking kidding me. - Jeremy, what the fuck happened to her? - Brett, the less we know about this situation the better. Give me my fucking keys. - What, you're leaving? - Yeah, we're leaving. - Man, I need you! Seriously! - You know what you need? You need a fucking lawyer. Seriously. - I didn't want to have to do this. - Oh, good, why don't you go with your gut. - I know all your shit, man. I'll tell Candace all about Maria. Tell her about the money. The kid. - That's real bro code breaking what you're doing, my friend. - I'll do it. - So, you're willing to risk my business, my family, my house, my bar, for some dead bitch in the trunk of your car? [dramatic music] You know, a divorce, it may break my bank but a murder one rap, my friend, that's some shit that you're not walking away from. - I have covered up every one of your shady secrets. I've taken out every guy you've ever pointed at. And I've silenced every one of them strippers that has ever polished you off. You could do this one damned thing for me and I'll never ask you for anything again. - What do you think, Brett? How do you feel about this? - Perry, we've been friends since we were kids. He's family. - So? - And I owe him $10,000. 15. 20? Fucking I owe you 20? He's family, Perry. - That's where it's at, right? That's where it's at. Get over there and get the body out of the trunk. I can't believe I'm fucking helping your with this bullshit. [dramatic music] - [Jeremy] Sit her over there. - Wow, this isn't rapey at all. Jeremy, you got your hobo mattress, your leaky pipes, desolation. - Let me ask you, do panties just evaporate in a swinging joint like this? - Is this where you bring all your pussies that you crush or just the ones that like role playing Nightmare on Elm Street? - Come on, I didn't mean for this to happen. - Well, why don't you tell us exactly what did happen? - Just, the usual. At the bar trying to get lucky, it's hardly any girls in there. - Almost closing time, Daisy. I am getting angsty, if you know what I mean. - Mm-hmm. It's pretty dead in here tonight. But. - Oh, well, fuck me. - That' the idea, isn't it? - Talk to her yet? - Nope. She hasn't said five words since she got in here. She's giving off that kind of bitchy, high class vibe. She's probably out of your league. - Oh, shut up, You met one out of my league yet? - Ooh, looks like you may have an interception. - Oh. [laughs] I'm not too worried about that. - [Daisy] Hey. - Hey, Daisy. Can I get one more before I leave for the night? - [Daisy] Sure thing, hun. - Thank you. [bar patrons chattering] - Hi. - Hi. How ya doing? - I'm better now. - Oh. Thank you. So, what's going on? - You smell sweet. - That's probably just my body spray. - Get the fuck outta here! - I don't have much of a sweet tooth but. [tablets splash] You'll do. - Thanks, I guess. - You're not giving up. - Goddamn, I'm going in. - Hey, don't forget to set up the camera. - [Jeremy] I would like to buy you a drink. - No, you're not sweet. - But I'm special. - I'm sorry, hun. He's a little bit more my type. - Of course he is. Genetics lottery beats personality every time. You kids have fun, okay? - Better luck next time, champ. - Yeah, thanks, coach. - Get 'em next time, buddy. It's all right. - Thanks, bro. - Oh, Stu, when do you ever learn to just stay in your own league? - I dunno, maybe when Handsome Dan back there doesn't need his creepy ass sister to hook him up with booty calls. - Jealous much? - Fuck you, Daisy. This bar is full of dicks. - Let me get this straight, you guys roofied her? - I thought we just gave her a pinch. - Jesus Christ, Jeremy! - We were having a good time and she started talking about her kids and shit. Started looking like less of a lock, and I didn't even think it was working so I slipped her a little bit more. - Fucking idiot. - I didn't think we gave her that much but she blacked out immediately, I couldn't bring her back. She's just gone, man, dead. - Wonderful. - What would you have done? Man, look at her, she's a fucking knockout. I couldn't take a loss like that. - Perry, it's not wrong. - He's right. Yeah, you're right, Jeremy, you're right. Instead of lose another notch on your bedpost why not render beautiful woman comatose? Just pound away. Kinda like, necrophilia. - Oh, Perry, that's gross. I mean, she, no. Perry, that's gross. - Man, fuck you guys. I didn't do that shit. She was unresponsive. I checked her pulse there was nothing. - [Perry] Check it again. - Why? - Because I said to check it again. Because if she is not dead I am not risking getting my hands dirty over your shit. She comes back to life, you tell her the bedroom shenanigans got a little crazy. - Fucking dead, okay? - Brett, will you check her pulse, please? - No. I'm not going to fucking touch a dead chick. Perry, why the fuck do I have to do it? - Because I pay you to the shit that I fucking don't wanna do. - Fuck, okay. No, I got nothing. - Are you sure? - I'm no doctor but pretty sure I can count to zero. - All right. All right. This is what we're going to do. You're going to take her body, you're gonna put it in the trunk of your car, you're gonna drive her out to the pig farm next to the slaughterhouse on US 23. Now, it's real Boonville out there, there's not a lot of people. You wanna keep your headlights off so you don't get seen by the farm, all right? - Okay. Do you know someone out there? - Yeah, pigs. You throw her over the fence the next morning the only thing left is bones. Maybe not even that. - How do you know for sure? - Jeremy, you don't need to ask how I know that. Now, fucking get to it! - What, you're not going to come with me? - No, we're not coming with you. You're lucky that we even came out here tonight. Just fucking get it done. [eerie groaning] - I don't know, it sounded like it was. - [Jeremy] How could that be her? That didn't even sound human. - Uh, guys! - Where the fuck did she go? - I fucking just saw her. I mean, there wasn't even a fucking sound. - Oh my god. - Calm down. She could not have gotten far. - That's what I'm saying. If she's around here she's heard everything we've been saying. - Which changes virtually nothing. Just find her and let's get out of here. [ominous music] [ceiling thudding] [dramatic music] - Oh! Hey. - Where am I? What happened? Did you drug me? - No. - Where are we and who are they? - These are just my friends. You passed out and I took you here just to make sure that you were okay. - I passed out? - Yeah, in the car. I think maybe you had a few too many to drink. I was just trying to take care of you. - I taste the pills. - I don't understand there was no pills. - Did you. - Oh, no, no, we didn't. We could if you wanted to but. - I wanted to take you home to meet my children. Remember? I told you they're home. And they're probably starving. - It's really late but maybe we could find a drive-through or something? Pick them up some food and we could take it to them. - They have peculiar tastes. Where's my phone? - It's probably in my trunk. - What the hell is going on here? - We were just trying to make sure that you were okay. - What? Stop! What the hell? Please, let me go! - Just relax, have seat, this is just getting really weird. We need to get this done as soon as possible. - [Jeremy] What are you doing, man? - What you should have done in the beginning, Jeremy. Brett, will you please go get the ropes out of the back of my car? - What, you're gonna kill her? - Eventually. She's seen all our faces. - Please! Help! My children need me, I'm begging you! They're starving! - [Jeremy] Jesus Christ, man. - This is fucking psychology. This is mind games, man. She's trying to gain sympathy. - [Jeremy] I don't know, man. - [Woman] No, please, just let me go. They need me. - What the fuck are you waiting for, dipshit? Get the shit out of the trunk now. - Come on, man, she's got kids. - Fuck you, Conan, I have fucking kids. Get the fucking shit outta the trunk! - Fuck you so much, Perry. So much. - This shit isn't right, man. - You got me into this shit, man. You called me out here for a mop and bucket job. Just to clean up your fuck up. - Jeremy, please. - She knows who you are. You get roped, we all go down. [wind whooshing] [children giggling] - Perry, did you see something? - Hey, hey, hey! Will you fucking pay attention? This is some serious shit right now. - All right. [wheels squeaking] [children laughing] - Hey! Who's out there? Fuck this. - Have you always been this stupid? - I thought that I accidentally almost killed her. - Seriously, we need to get outta here. I'm pretty sure I heard somebody playing around outside. - Playing around? At 3:15 in the morning. - I dunno, man, it sounded like kids. - Yeah, yeah, my babies. My babies they're getting close. Please, I beg you, let me go. Please, let me go! - Shut your mouth or I will duct tape those goddamn lips shut myself. - I think we should just. - Just what? Just let her go? Let her go straight to the police? Let her tell them our names? Really, Jeremy? Use your fucking head! - I won't say a word, I promise. I promise, I won't say anything. Please, I'm begging. I just wanna see my babies. - Your babies. Your babies. I'm so sick of this bullshit. What are their fucking names, huh? - Connor, and Becky. - Bullshit. It's all bullshit. It's all fucking lies. - And... Camille. And James. - What did you say? You told her my kids' names? You fucking told her my kids' names? You sick fuck. - No, man. - Why would you do that? - I didn't say anything! - Why did you tell her my kids' names? - I swear, man, I didn't say anything. Your kids never came up. Why the fuck would I do that? - How the fuck does she know that shit? How do you know this shit? - On Norwood, you're on the last house on the left side. And Candace, she planted those daisies, and you hate them. And Camille, she's still up when you come home. She pretends she's asleep but she hears-- - Shut up! - When you come in the front. - Shut up! Shut the fuck up! - James, he's crying because he knows that you're not going to his game tomorrow. - Who do you fucking know that I know, bitch? Who? Tell me! You tell her this shit? Did he tell you this shit? Shit. - And Candace, she's done with you. She only cares about the kids. She's just gonna pack up and that's the end. And she's just gonna leave! [gun blasts] - [Brett] Perry? - Done. US 23 pig farm. If this gets traced back to me in any fucking way I will find a way to kill both of you. - Leave you forever. And the papers will be in the mail within a week of her departure. - [Perry] What the fuck? - [Woman] My babies. - [Perry] Yeah, we know, you're babies are hungry. - Are here. [metal scraping] - What? What the fuck is that? [metal scraping] [child growling] [metal clanks] - Perry, you mother fucker! [wheels screeching] [dramatic music] [child huffing] - Mother. Mom? - What the fuck you do? [Perry groaning] Where's our mother? Where's our mother? [man screams] [Perry moaning] [man screaming] [flesh ripping] [blood spurts] [Perry moans] - It was so nice of you to bring extras for my babies, Jeremy. I knew they would just love you too. Every last bite. [dramatic music] [child growling] [dramatic music] [ominous electronic music] [upbeat guitar music] [glasses clinking] - Hey. Did you have fun with my brother? What the fuck? Where's my brother? Where's Jeremy? - Why don't you fucking tell me? - Where the fuck is my brother? Listen, bitch, if you know what's best for you you'll get the fuck outta my bar. - You know it's funny because your brother he's gutless. And my children we don't like the taste of a coward or malevolence. It's kind of tangy. You wouldn't know that. Okay, because the sweet guys, well, the emit a different odor. - So, wait a second, you ate my brother because you think cowards taste better? Are you fucking insane? - No, of course not. No, I'm a mother. And all good mothers we allow our children to eat first!
