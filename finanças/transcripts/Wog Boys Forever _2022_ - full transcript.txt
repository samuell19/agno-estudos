I'm Derryn Hinch and welcome to '24 Hours'. Tonight we begin the program with a sad story about a recent social phenomenon that affects more people in this country than anyone ever realised. Whether they are divorced, widowed, or just unlucky in love, thousands of Aussies have given up on any chance of ever finding a partner. They're probably sitting in front of their TV right now, all alone, eating a microwave dinner, and thinking, how did my life ever come to this? Our reporter Susan Vance takes a closer look into this modern day... Shut up, Derryn! If I put 'Malaka' into my GPS it'd take me straight to your place. It doesn't matter what the function is, weddings, anniversaries, baptisms, you name it. We guarantee you the best pizza you've ever had. And just for giving Mario's a chance, we we're gonna offer you free delivery. Isn't that right, Dad? Yeah, that's right, Franky. Forget the Goober bullshit. Your order from us and we deliver to you for bloody free. And with 83 shops right around Australia, there's bound to be a restaurant near you. So... Tell the Goober "Ciao" and call Mario's Pizza now. Happy birthday, Steve. Happy birthday. ♪ Lonely, I'm Mr Lonely ♪ I have nobody for my own ♪ Now I'm so lonely ♪ I'm Mr Lonely... ♪ No way. ♪ Wish I had someone ♪ To call on the phone. ♪ Hi. Hey. Just going to 295 Johnson Street, Princes Hill, please. OK. No probs. Thanks. Hi, Cleo. Ahh... Steve. Steve Karamitsis. Steve? Yeah. (CHUCKLES Wow. I can't believe it. It's been such a long time. Yeah. What, like, gosh, I think 20 years or something. Ahh, yeah, just about. Maybe 18 years and a bit. So, how's it all going? Oh, well, let's see. Last time you saw me I was wearing a cool leather jacket and driving a '69 Valiant Pacer. And now I'm driving this taxi and wearing this ugly shirt. Yeah, I reckon things are going just great. Aw. Steve, there's nothing wrong with driving a taxi. Besides, I think the shirt looks cute. Ahh, not really but yeah, thanks. We met at Chasers Disco. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I saw you and your girlfriends at the bar and I bought you some shots. Yeah, that's right. What are they called again? Cock-sucking Cowboys. Yeah. So '90s. I love it. Hey, how's your best mate? Frank. How's he going? You guys used to do that awesome dance together. Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. Oh, right. Remind me again, how long did we go out for? One week. Wow. I was quite the temperamental bitch back then, wasn't I. No. You were too smart. You still are. Hey, I noticed you're still wearing that evil eye necklace. Yeah. Yeah. Is it the same one? Yeah, it is. God, I can't believe you still remember it. It used to be my grandmother's. Yeah, your grandmother's. She gave it to you for good luck. Yeah, that's right. Oh, this is me. Just here. Oh, just here? Yeah. No probs. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. That's OK. I'll just pay on card, please. No, that's OK. This one's on me. Oh, come on. Are you sure? Yeah. Next time you see me out and about just buy me a Cock-sucking Cowboy. OK. Although, I'll have to explain to those millennials it is just a drink. Yeah. You know, you actually deserved longer than a week. My bad. Take care, Steve. Yeah, you too. Thanks. Hey. I don't know what happened between you and Frank but I hope you guys can fix it. Hey, Mario's Pizza? What? No, we don't do no gluten-free pizza and if we did it wouldn't be for free. Idiot. Hey, look who's here. Re Malaka, where have you been? Good to see you too, Theo. What's it been now, eight years. Eh? Hey, you know, I've had stuff to do. Is Frank here, mate? No, he don't come in here anymore. He stay home with his mansion and count the cash. He drive a Ferrari. Really? Steve Karamitsis. Is that you? You've got 83 shops now and you're still here working. Ahh, you know me, Steve, I never stop working. Good to see you, Mario. Good to see you. Yeah. Hey, I like this new shop, huh? These pictures, are they your family? I have no idea who they are. The designers put them up there. I think because they're better looking than my family. It's good to see you, Steve. So, how are you doing? Are you married? You got kids? No. I've kept out of that prison. Prison, eh? You need a son to carry your name or it stays with you. Hey, relax. Relax. Leave him alone. Yeah, relax. You know, Steve, seeing you here reminds me of the old days. But this neighbourhood is different. It's a whole new crowd. All these bloody hipsters. The other day one come in and says to me, "Do you have Afterpay?" I said, "Of course you have to pay, everybody have to pay. Stronzo" Mario. Calm down. Come on. Relax. Sit down. The doctor tell you to take it easy. Sit, Steve. Sit. You know, Steve, we're family, yeah? Capisce? Mario, I'm sorry it took me this long to come and see you. Alright? It's alright. Shit happens. But go and see Frank, yeah? He misses you. You two have to look after each other, Steve. Capisce? OK, I will. Hey, Mario, is quiet now. Why not go out the back and have a rest. Hey? Yeah. Good idea. Get up. And I'll bring the tablets that the doctor give you. Come on. Oh and don't forget to say hi to his ball-busting wife for me, yeah? You've got the wrong house, dickhead. Hey, Frank. It's me, Steve. Steve? What are you doing in a taxi shirt? What do you think? I'm a cabbie. No way! Mate, are you gonna let me in or what? Yeah. OK. Yeah, drive through, all the way to the top. I don't believe it. You're still alive. Hi, Frank. Up there? Yeah, man. Up the steps. The fuck, man? You alright? Yeah, I'm OK. But you on the other hand, wow. I guess you need a lot of dough to make a lot of dough, huh? Still a smart-ass. It's good to see. Do you remember why the two of us stopped talking to each other back then? Yeah, you told me I couldn't be your best man and I remember getting upset about it. Nope. Not a hundred percent correct. See, I was trying to explain to you that because I'd already asked you to be my best man at my first wedding, well, it was bad luck to ask you a second time. And do you remember what you said back to me? Er... No. You told me to go home and fuck my shoe because there'd been a... C-U-N-T in it all day. Whoa! That was pretty harsh, huh? I'm sorry, Frank. Alright? I wanna apologise. Eight years later you pop up here onto my doorstep wanting to apologise. Well, you know what, you can go and get f... Frank, what's going on? Hey, babe. Look who's here. Steve. Wow. It's nice to see you. Yeah, nice to see you too, Angela. Well, what are you both hanging out here for? Frank, invite Steve to come inside. Yeah. Come inside. Thanks, Frank. Nice place. Nice? It's better than nice, mate. Look, look at all this furniture. This is Versace. Do you know Versace? Yeah, the clothes designer guy. That's right. He's dead now. Hey, here's the family. This is little Mario. Hey. Say hello to my old mate, Steve. Hey, Steve. You like my hair? Dad said the curls get the girls. They sure do. Nice to meet you, Mario. Hey, you've got your nonno's name, huh? Yeah. Nonno says Mummy's a gold digger. Anyway. And this is my little angel, Alexis. - Hello. - Yes. No, not you. My daughter Alexis. How can I help you? You believe it? Some dickhead went and named the voice on that computer the same name as my daughter, Alexis. Yes. How can I help you? But Steve, you know what? It's amazing. Anything you want it to do it does. What's it called again, babe? Home automation. Home motoration. Home motivation. Unreal. You gotta get one. Watch this, Steve. Alexis, turn off the lights. Lights off. OK, Daddy. No, not you, babe. Frank would have I told you about playing with that thing when your daughter's in the house? Alexis, turn the lights on. Lights on. See? ANGELA: Get rid of it or I will. OK. So nice to see you again, Steve. You too, Angela. Take care. Bye, Steve. Bye, kids. Nice to meet youse. Bye. They're nice family. Married life, mate. So, what's going on, Steve? You shacked up or what? No. No, I'm single. Single, you? Since when? Since Zoe left to me and went back to Mykonos, you know. Ahh. Now it's beginning to make some sense. You and Zoe break up just before my wedding, you take it out on me, you spend the next eight years in some sort of heartbreak coma. Coma? Mmm. No, mate. I'm alright. You're alright? Come on, make. Look at yourself. Look at you. You used to be Steve Karamitsis, the OG. Now you're just a sad and lonely W-O-G. Nah. I'm not that bad. Not bad? No, really? Oh. So, who have you got on the chick radar? Anyone? You know who jumped in my today? Cleo. You remember her? Cleo. Yes, I do. Cleo, that hot Egyptian chick. She dumped you after a week, didn't she? Yeah but you know what she said? No. That dumping me was her bad. Yeah. That I deserved more than a week. Huh? Mate. Mate, she was coming onto you. Really? Yes, dickhead! Of course she was. Do you know where she lives? Where I dropped her off, I suppose. Well, what are you waiting for? You've gotta get back there, Cheech. You've gotta get back there now. Now? Of course. She's waiting for you. You got her all hot and bothered again for a bit of that souvlaki and then you what, you drove off? What's the matter with you? You think so? Yes. Come on. Let's go. You've gotta get there now. You gotta go. - Alexis, open the door. - Door opening. Door closing. I think you're right. She was waiting for me to ask for her number, wasn't she? Yes. Thanks, Frank. And it's good seeing you again, you know. I'm sorry that I called you a C-U... No, thanks, mate. Don't worry. Come here. Come on. Good? Yeah. I'm alright. Hey, Cheech. Come here. Zoe would have stayed in Australia, you know. She loved you. You just didn't fight hard enough to convince her that you felt the same way. You know what I mean? Yeah. I know. Back then I had my head too far up my own culo, you know? Yeah. See you, Frank. Fuckin' Greeks and their egos. Alexis, open the door. Open door, Alexis. Open the door! Alexis is no more. Get the fuck inside. Fuck! Geez! And as my mother, the late, great, Raelene Beagle-Thorpe would always say, "No-one has a right to actually be in this country if they weren't born here." Mmm. It's good. I love that picture of Mummy. Clayton. Always good to see you, little brother. Mmm. Yes. This was just before the Wog Boy ruined her life. I have updates on Operation Tzatziki. Do tell. I already have him on video committing about a dozen illegal acts in his taxi. Excellent. But it needs to get much more personal. Understand? You got it, big sister. Mmm. Clayton. With the Wog Boys, it's all about the famiglia. The famiglia. Mmm. Now, where were we? Yeah? You free? Nuh, I'm not free, mate. What? Then, what are you doing? What are you, Neighbourhood Watch? Just call another cab. Yeah? Yeah, fuck cabs. I'm calling a Goober. You know what? Go back to watching porn and pulling your dick, you loser. I'm not watching porn, mate. And my dick is in my jocks. I buy them extra large so it can fit. Fuck you. A kick potentially worth millions. Shoot again! You calling me from her bed? No, I'm following her in a Goober. She's with some young guy. How young? Oh, about 18, 19. Hey, how long ago was it that you and Cleo did the hokey pokey? Oh, about 18 years and a bit. This kid, has he got one eyebrow and a big nose? No. But he's a real smart arse. Yep. Good chance he's your kid. My kid? You reckon? Did you use a franga? I can't remember anything. I had too many Cowboys that night. They're going into that nightclub, Privilege. OK. Park the car, go in, and start talking to her. Yeah. Alright. Frank? Switch off the TV and come and help me put the kids to bed. Hey listen, Steve, I've gotta go, alright? Storytime for the kids. OK. Have fun. Hi. I'm Steve. What's your name? Sapphire. Door bitch from hell. Yeah, right. It's nice to meet you. How may I help you tonight? Well, Sapphire, I would like to come inside your club and spent a shitload of money, if you know what I mean. Sorry. Tonight's for members only. Please, can you step aside? Thank you. Come on in. Hey, Sapphire... I think I paid you that membership fee before, if you know what I mean. Listen, mate, we have a strict no dickheads policy here. So if you don't piss off right now, I'm gonna call security onto you. If you know what I mean. Well, give me my hundred bucks back. Take it easy, mate. Take it easy, alright? Whoo! Eugh! I just got up to Green Belt in Tae Kwon Do. You know what that means, mate? You know what that means? I'm a killer, mate. These hands could kill you, mate. With just a chop like that. On your neck, dead. Dead, mate. Dead. You understand? Don't look at me like that, mate. You're getting me upset now. Don't look at me, mate. Look away, look away. Alright? Ha! Ho!

You still remember the moves or what? Shit yeah, man, of course. Let's show these kids how it's done. Ready? Cheers. Welcome to my big fat wog nightmare. Kick 'em out. Now! Guys, we need to move. ♪ My baby moves at midnight ♪ Goes out until the dawn ♪ My woman takes me higher ♪ My woman keeps me warm ♪ What you doin' on your back Yeah ♪ You should be dancing, yeah ♪ Dancing, yeah. ♪ Yeah! What's up, man? You can't dance this way? Come on, man. It's not 9pm. What are you doing? Oh, come on! Oh! It's our chance to do this. Alright! Eugh! Come on! This is a Versace shirt, man. I'll remember you, mate. I'll remember you, don't you worry. I'll be coming back. Whoa! Let's go, mate. Forget about it. You're so lucky. Wog Boy! You forgot your jacket. Look out. Sorry, mate. Had to kick your dad out. My what? You didn't know? My condolences. He's a real fuckwit. Hey. Are Steve and Frank OK? Yeah, it's all good, mate. Mum, we need to talk. Nice. Show me. Good! Yes, little brother? You're gonna absolutely love what we got tonight. Does it make him look bad? Both of them, the Wog Boy and his newly discovered son, Michael. Excellent. Two for the price of one. You know how much I love that. Put it in my mouth. So, this girl I dated a long time ago, right, Cleo, jumped into my cab last week, you know. Nice. Yeah. And then last night I found out she has a son and it's mine. Hey! Congratulations, bro. Tell us about your son. Oh, he's a real good kid, you know, a hard worker. Nothing like his dad. Hi, Steve. Oh, hi, Cleo. Ooh! Congratulations. Steve's a great guy. Can't wait to meet his son. Is there somewhere we can talk? Yeah, sure. Let's just go over there. Hey, listen, I'm sorry about last night. Look, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Yeah, tell me about it. We weren't meant to leave till about 9pm. Michael's not your son. You know that night after we first met and I came back to your place? We just kissed. And then you fell asleep. Do you remember? Ahh, no. I can't remember anything. I had too many Cowboys. I met someone not long after you. Michael was born in Egypt. We left there when he was 13. We've been in Australia ever since. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah, I thought he was too tall to be my son. Everyone in my family's only up to here. You know. Sorry, Cleo. I feel like a real dickhead. No. Hey, it's not your fault. I totally understand. It was such a long time ago. Sorry to interrupt. Steve, there's a bitchin' black Lamborghini parked right outside the front, bro. Come and have a look. Goldi brought me. He's my boyfriend. I'd better go. What the fuck! Hey, wait, I'll walk you out. How long does it take to go from zero to 100ks? Oh, probably about the same amount of time it takes you to come. 2.9 seconds. Bye, Steve. Come on, baby. I'm ready. Let's go. Hey, Steve, next time I need to cab it, I'll know who to call. Then again, do I look like I need a cab? Ooh. She made the wrong choice, my man. I mean, look at you and then look at him. No comparison. I've always been a bad liar and a terrible poker player. Hey. Don't worry about him. I've barred that dickhead from the club. Yeah, why would you do that? Steve's a really nice guy. He just got excited about being a father. Yeah. Well, it looks like you were the last good thing to happen to that loser. Baby, I'm really not in the mood right now. Look, I know I'm a little rough around the edges sometimes, right? Sometimes? That's the understatement of the century. Alright, always, right? But seriously though, in our industry, only the strong survive, right. You and I, we did what we set out to do four years ago. Right? And together we created the hottest club in town. Right? When I retire I'm gonna hand the keys over to Michael. Michael, shit! I've gotta go. I promised him we'd grab lunch together. Oh! Wait. I thought we were gonna have a drink. Eugh, fuck me. Well, hello, Dad. I'm sorry. I messed up, alright. Is your mum home? No. Hey, wait. Is that of a four barrel Holley in your hand? Yeah. What, from an LH? An IX. Don't tell me you've got an original SLR 5000. I wish. It's a stuck IX but I'm rebuilding it as an SLR 5000. Yeah, smart move. You're gonna make a mint. Yeah, that's the plan. Are you gonna let me in to see it or am I gonna have to stand here and look at your T-shirt all day? Hey! Where did you find this? Grandpa left it for me. Yeah, right. Yeah, my dad left me his '69 Valiant Pacer. Oh, nice. You still got that? I don't want to talk about it, mate. Oh. Sorry. Hey, 308! Did you rebuild it yourself? Yeah, last year. Also got a nice lumpy cams, flattop pistons, roller rockers. You know, the whole thing's been fully balanced. Good job. Hey, when you're ready, my mate, he owns old school cruisers. I reckon we could pick up 70K for this, easy. No shit. Are you serious? Yeah. And then maybe you can take that girl the works behind the bar out on a date. Who, Sophie? No. She's like, six years older than me. No way. So what? Big deal. She likes you. Yeah? Yeah, how would you know? I saw the way she looked at you at the club. And I saw the way that you looked at her. Hey, don't make the same mistake as me, alright, and keep your head under this hood for the rest of your life. There's more to life than just rebuilding cars. You know what I mean? Hello. Hey, Mum. Guess what? Hey. Steve's gonna help me sell the car. Wow, look at you two. Best buddies all of a sudden. When did this all happen? Actually, I came by to see you. I haven't forgotten my promise. So, if you're free, we could drop in at my place and you can pick out some records. Now? Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, Steve, I can't. I promised Michael that we'd grab lunch together. Oh, I really had something to eat. What? Yeah, I got hungry. Mum, you should go. If his collection's anything like his knowledge of cars, you'll pick up something with a mint. Hey, I promise I'll have you back you within the hour, huh? OK. Yeah, sure. Let's go check out this amazing vinyl collection of yours. Great. And I'll make sure my mate doesn't charge you any commission, alright? Thanks, Steve. No worries. Yeah, this is like a garage but what I've done is I've converted it into a unit. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, you'll see now when we go inside. Hello, Steve! Hey, Guiseppina. What's going on? Oh, nothing. I'm just sit here having my coffee, watching the birds and see who's died this week. Oh, this is my friend Cleo. Ahh. Special friend. Hello, Clio. Actually it's Cleo. Ah, Cleo, Clio, same thing. Nice to meet. You Italian? No, I'm Egyptian. Oh, shit. It doesn't matter. In Australia all the same same. Italian, Greek, Egypt, all the same. All Italian. Ahh, hello, beautiful girl. Hi. Who are you? I'm Cleo. Hello, Cleon. Vince, this special friend of Steve. Ahh, very special, huh? Hey, you Italian? Vince she Egyptian. She's Egyptian? Yes. Oh, shit. Hey, it doesn't matter. Hey, you two going out tonight? No, we're just gonna go to my place and check out my records. Yeah. Ahh, record, huh? I understand. OK, we'd better it going. Nice to meet you both. Nice to meet you, Catalogue. Nice to meet you, Crayon. Mah! Steve is very lucky I'm not 20 years younger. Otherwise all this girls today. I fix them all up. Suck! Suck, huh? Suck this! Hey, Steve! Who's this girl, hey? She's your girlfriend? No, Pino. This is Cleo. She's from Egypt. You know, like Cleopatra. Oh, you chiropractor. That's good. No. Hey, Steve, she's a beauty one, hey? What's wrong with you? Hurry up and get marry. Or I'm gonna marry. Excuse me, chiropractor, you like cucumber? Oh... OK, here we are. Come on in. It's nice. Yeah. It's... Yeah. I put the records here for you, just to make it a bit easier. Thanks. Yeah, just pick out whatever you want, alright? OK, Cool. Yeah. You want something to drink? Oh, I'll just have a water, please. You got it. Thanks. There's definitely some rare vinyl in here. Yeah. Oh, wow. You've still got the old Chasers VIP medallion? Yeah, check out the membership number on the back. 007. Of course, what else. Yeah. I don't believe it. You've still got the old Chasers Nightclub matches? Oh, really? I wonder if it's got some girl's name and number written on the inside. Nah, I don't think so. This is my name and number. I remember this. Oh. I wrote it down for you on the night we first met. Really? Mmm. We were only together for what, a week but you kept these matches with my name and number written on the inside for all these years? Why? Oh, I didn't even know they were in there. Come on, Steve, don't play dumb. It's really sweet. Knock on the door. She's still there. She's in there. Steve? Yeah? I just wanna... Hold that thought. Hold that thought just one second. Steve! I just come to give my salami to your girlfriend. I bring a panettone. I just bring this nice cucumber. Not a good time, guys. Not a good time. She's a good one, Steve. Steve. Give her the cucumber. Sorry about that, Cleo. What were you saying? Oh, hang on, it's Mikey. Oh. Yeah, hon? Tonight we end the program... Mum, turn on Hinch now. With a blast from the past. OK. I'll call you back. Can you turn the TV on Hinch? Ah, yeah, sure. ♪ Get tzatziki wit it Na na na na na na ♪ Get tzatziki wit it... ♪ HINCH: Remember this bloke? Steve Karamitsis. Probably better known to all of you as the Wog Boy. He became famous over 20 years ago on this show for being a dole bludger. Well, you'll never guess what he's up to now. He's a cabbie, and here he is hooning around in his taxi, dragging off other cars through the city streets. Can you believe this? He's also a party bus host that gives refuge to escaped asylum seekers. This bloke is Ruben Namalume from the Congo. Ruben! He's been on the run for three years since he escaped from a detention centre. Man, you've got help me get out of here. And it wouldn't be a real party unless the Wog Boy's old mate, Frank Di Benedetto was there too. Remember him? Daddy, you're on TV! Unlike his best mate Steve... Hey, it's me. Frank has struck it rich as the owner of the Mario's Pizza chain. That's right, stronzo. That's right. - Frank... - And here they are partying it up... What's this? Just like the old days... I'm on TV. At Privilege's nightclub owned by the notorious Peter Gold, better known as Goldi. Fuck! I need more Botox. Now, this bloke has twice been up on drug dealing and money laundering charges but has never been convicted. Yeah, I reckon some filler under your cheeks as well, lift them up a bit. Later that night, after some kind of fallout, Steve, Frank, and the Congolese escapade were all thrown out onto the street by Goldi and his hoons. That Goldi is such a Bogan. Kind of turns me on. Pizza shops, discos, there's lots of cash going through businesses like that, isn't there? What's he tryin' to say? He's saying we're crooks. Bastard. One thing's for sure, wherever there's pizza, there's lots of dough to be made. It's not true. I'm not believe. I'm not believe. Bloody poo, you bastard, Hinch. Please, don't spit on the television. Have you seen the Wog Boy footage? Yes, I've seen the footage and my department will be doing a thorough investigation. Now... Beagle-Thorpe? You'll have to excuse us. I'm going to be godmother to my brother Clayton's daughter and we have a rehearsal to go to. That's Raelene's kids. I've gotta get going. Here's your matches. OK. I'll give you a lift. No, it's cool. Michael's nearly here. No, wait, Cleo. Hang on a sec... Steve Karamitsis would say, "Keep calm and wog on." Yeah? Steve, are you watching Hinch? Yeah. What's going on, mate? This is no good. It's Raelene's kids, they're messing with us. Those little shits. So, what are we gonna do? Don't know, mate. Don't know what we're gonna do but we better do something 'cause they just ruined my chances with Cleo. Hey, how did the matches idea go? Yeah. Yeah it worked, mate, until Hinch stuffed it up again. So tell me, how many matches with numbers have you got? Hey, I gotta go, I've got another call. You there? Yeah, Tony? Tony, what's up? Steve, Steve! My cousin Government, he said other Minister hate you. And anyone that know you and not citizen like me in big trouble, farken. Don't worry, Tony, it's OK. I'll sort it out, OK? OK. Hey, be careful, Steve. Here. Take free pepper spray, farken. Ahh, yeah. Thanks, Tony. I'll call you soon, alright? Hey. You have train ticket, farken? No. ♪ Ferrari Ferrari ♪ Mio Ferrari Ferrari ♪ Faturmo I'amore Ferrari... ♪ Hey, you right, mate? Yeah, I'm fine. You have a good day, alright? Love you, mate. Bye, dad. Hey.

We make the best cars too. Look. Hey, hang around. Watch this. You'll love it. You stuck up sofisticata. Eugh. Whoa! Eugh! What happened to you? I got pepper sprayed by that PSO. Minister, sorry to interrupt but there's a Steve Karamitsis here to see you. He said it was urgent. Yes, Jenkins, thank you. Let him in. Right on cue. Mr Karamitsis, thanks for stopping by. You saved the government a lot of money on postage. What's this? All of your hooning fines. You don't have a lot of respect for road laws, do you? A lack of respect to something you'd know a lot more about than me. Excuse me, do you know who you're talking to? Hey, yeah, Raylene's spoiled kids. Hey, can we move this along? What do you want? Twenty years ago you humiliated my mother and destroyed her political career. Oh, we're way beyond the 'what do we want' moment. We're up to the 'we're going to destroy you 'and everything you love' moment. Hey, you've got red hair just like her? Yeah, I guess it's a case of deja rouge all over again.

Call an ambulance, quick. Quick, quick. Hi, Goldi. How the fuck did you get in here? Relax, I'm not after you. I want Michael. Mikey? Why? Well, that's my business. I don't care how you do it but I want him caught doing something illegal. Yeah, not happening. I love that kid. The only thing you love is what you see in the mirror. You're a narcissistic prick who would sell out his own mother for a bag of chips. Speaking of bags, one of my undercovers was sold some cocaine from one of your employees inside your club. So what? Nothin' to do with me. Ooh. Your prints are all over the bag. How's your reputation going these days, Goldi? Do you think you can get off a third time? Just as I thought. You do as I tell you and it all disappears. How can I trust you? You're a fuckin' politician. 'Cause I don't want you going to gaol. I want you right here. Lover. Hello. Hello. Ooh! Even though my dad never went to school very much, he never liked the thought of anyone thinking of him as an illiterate fool. He'd often say things like, "Hey, Frank, "they think I know fuck nothing "but I tell them, I know fuck all." He worked hard, every day of the week, to make sure that my life, my family's would be a lot easier than his ever was. He taught me that becoming a father was a selfless act. And most importantly, he taught me that family was everything. And family didn't always mean having the same blood. So, I just wanna... Raise your glasses and make a toast to a great man, my dad. - Mario. - To Mario. Hey, boss? I want you to take this cash to Michael's place for me now. But I never deliver the money. We're a little bit short-staffed. Go on. I tell you what... you get an 8 ball for your trouble. Hey? On the house. Yeah? Sweet. Thanks. Yeah, alright. Go, go now. Go on. Fuck off. Go. Yeah, he just left. Receive the sign of the cross on your brow and on your heart. Brianna, do you believe in God the Almighty Father, Creator of heaven and earth? I do.

And all his temptations in all his forms? I do renounce them. And all his pomps? I do renounce them. Brianna Beagle-Thorpe, go in peace and may the Lord be with you. Amen. Amen. Oh, thank you so much. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Got 'em all except for that PSO. What happened? Congratulations, cousin Tony, you are now an Australian citizen. Ahh! Yes! Thank you, Tony, I mean minister, farken. Oh! You ready? All together. Australia, good country, farken. Come, come. Lovely family. Thank you, farken. Thank you, farken. We're outside court where employees of the Privilege nightclub, Asher Jacobson and Michael Sedra have been found guilty of theft and drug trafficking. Both have been released on bail. Minister, why were you in court today? Michael Sedra is not an Australian citizen. He came into this country on a child a visa about five years ago. Today as an adult he's been found guilty of serious crimes and as such, once he has completed a sentence I'll be immediately deporting him back to Egypt. But Minister, is that fair? Yes, it is. No further questions. Cleo, Cleo! How do you feel about the Minister wanting to deport your son? Look, I don't really want to... Michael is completely innocent. Alright? He was conned by a drug dealing junkie. We'll be appealing. Now back the fuck off. Is the club involved in this? Privilege nightclub is open for business. But give us something about the case though, Goldi. Piss off, mate. Are you part of this or what? Come on. Drive, drive! I want to know. Give us some answers. Come on, Goldi. What the fuck's he doing here? Just when you thought this day couldn't get any worse. - You OK? - Eugh! No, I'm not OK. The only reason this is all happening is because that crazy woman has it out for you at things that Michael is your son. I'm sorry, Cleo. I'll sort it out. No, just leave us alone. I regret ever seeing you again. Can you believe this shit? Yeah. It's obviously some kind of setup, you know. Hey, don't worry, it'll be OK. Alright? Michael! I'll call you later. You're a loser at the top of your game. If I were you - and thank god I'm not - I'd go back to the Minister's office and I'd throw myself at her feet and I would beg for her forgiveness. How did you know I was at her office? What? I never told anybody. Maybe I'm a fuckin' psychic. See you later, Wog Boy. Off you pop. Psychic my arse. Small Capricciosa, extra olives. Thanks, Frank. It's been a while, huh? Sure has. I haven't made pizzas for like, six years. Yeah. I miss it, you know. I really do. It's who I am. It's me. Oh, before I forget... Read the reading of my dad's will today. He left you something. Here. No way. Really? Yeah. He loved you, Steve. Sometimes more than me. Nah! Nah, man, that's too much. No it's not. Shut up. Take it and go and get the old Steve back. No. That Steve is long gone, mate. He's not. He's just missing his super powers. Eh? The thing that made you invincible. You know what they say, mate, you can teach an old wog new tricks. Hey, I'm not that old. Yeah, neither am I. ♪ We were born to be alive ♪ Born, born to be alive born to be alive ♪ Yes, we were born ♪ Born, born ♪ Born to be alive. ♪ ♪ People ask me why ♪ I never find a place to stop ♪ And settle down, down, down... ♪ Boo!

Now, Tony, I need you to ask your cousin the Minister to get Vince here the cleaning job at Brianna's office. Mate, do you think you can do that? Yes, there's no problem, farken. Great. Thanks, Tony. Hey, Tony, you want a coffee? Guiseppina, make coffee, please. Hey, Guiseppina! Alright, alright. Why do you always yell for, I'm just here. Hello, Steve. Hey. Very nice. Tony, you want coffee? Yes.

Hey, where did you learn how to do all this hacking stuff? Back in India I was an IT technician. Ooh. Whoa, got to go. My shift is starting soon. If you need anything else, come visit me, bro. Shit! Where the hell have you been? Hey, sorry. We can't start without you. Get out there. OK. It looks like the Auslan interpreter's here so let's start. More than 800 noncitizen criminals were stripped of their visas for serious crimes last year. I'm sorry, am I going too fast? Would you like me to slow down? Oh, no, that's alright. Yeah. There is no place in our country for people who come here and harm Australians. I mean, we welcome people from all around the world but those few who think that they can live in Australia and be involved in criminal actions... need to know that they won't be staying long. I'm sorry. What's so funny? Sorry, what's going on? Wait a minute. What? That's... Excuse me? Clayton! What... Clayton! Clayton? Wait. Clayton! Clayton, stop chasing that ugly old woman. Um... We're just going to have to reconvene so let's take five, OK. Go, go, drive! Did they make you an offer? Yes, 60K. Oh, that's good. But wait till the end of the day, alright? 'Cause that's when all the serious buyers are gonna come up to you. Gotcha. Is Cleo here? Yeah, she's in the cafe. What don't you go speak to her? Is it safe? She's Egyptian, it's never safe. Yeah. Can I join? Yeah, sure. Thanks for helping Michael with his car. Hey, you know, it's the least I can do. He's a good kid. Yeah, he is. You know, it was really tough on him, growing up in Egypt. I mean, the first few years, they were OK but then his dad started drinking... becoming violent. If he gets deported, Steve, I'm not sure how safe he's gonna be. Can I ask you something? It's about Goldi, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it always is. Look, I'm with him because he really cares about me and Michael. And we're business partners. No-one's tougher on that guy than I am. But he's actually never done anything to hurt us. Um... We ahh... We hacked into Brianna's computer in her office. She's got a meeting on Monday night at 11:30 at Privilege. Why? Well, I don't think it's about her VIP medallion. Cleo, I need you to do me a favour, alright? I want you to take what's in this box as a gift to Goldi for his office. It's got a hidden camera inside it. I can't do that. We both know Michael was set up, OK? Goldi's the only one who could have done that. No. What? You're wrong. He told me something that only Brianna could have told him about. OK? Next minute he's got a meeting with her at his club. OK. It's OK. I'll... I'll find some other way to get it in there. OK? Hey, Steve. What? I just got an offer for 70K. It happened exactly how you said it would. OK, great! Let's go sign him up! Yeah. Come on, let's go. Steve... Yeah? Give me the box. Good luck. Yeah, thanks. Do you like it? Yeah, it's nice. What is it? It's an evil eye like the one I wear. Oh, yeah. It'll help protect you from bad luck, evil spirits. Yeah. How about I put it up here? Yeah, go for it. I mean, it was meant to be a surprise. I didn't think you'd still be here. Oh, look, I've got this meeting with this new promoter tonight. Bloody dickhead's running late so... Look, I should keep cracking into it. Yeah, me too. I've gotta run. Michael's waiting out the front. Alright. Mwah. Bye. Bye. Good luck. See you. Bye. Hey. No say nothing. Got a lot of people from the government here. Ahh, shut up. Can we play poker machine, bingo, something? Shut up and get this way. Smell like Vegemite. When we get to the chorus, I want you to give me a bit more oomph. Oi, pizzas are here. Anyone hungry? Go for it. Rusty Nail! I love your music, mate. Hey. Good on you, digger. You certainly don't look like a boy from the bush. Mate, I used to love the bush. Married now. Hey, come and try some of the very famous Pizza Fagioli. Come on. Oh... Come on, mate. Come on. Eh?
