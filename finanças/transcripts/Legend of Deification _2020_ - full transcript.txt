[narrator] In the last years of the Shang Dynasty, Emperor Zhou became a fatuous tyrant. Seeing an opportunity, The Fox Devil, Nine Tailed, transformed herself into Daji, the Royal Consort and took control of the government. The Fox clan brought chaos to the world. Heaven took pity on the people. When at last they rebelled, the Master of Jingxu Hall sent divine reinforcement. Thus the Three Realms were engulfed in war. [growling] [horses neigh] [snarling] [screaming] [narrator] Jingxu Hall's foremost disciple, Jiang Ziya, set forth to vanquish Nine Tailed once and for all. [Nine Tailed laughing] My love, what have you done? Where are you? [Nine Tailed laughing] [Zhou screaming] Enough! Stop this at once! Jiang Ziya. Aah... [growls] Your illusions do not frighten me, Fox Devil! [Nine Tailed laughs] We have the same goal, do we not? [Nine Tailed] Must we quarrel over a single, pitiful dynasty? It is mankind's destiny to serve the Fox Clan forever! [laughs] I invoke the Suppressing Seal! Malignant spirits. Be vanquished! [gasps] [ice crackling] [yells] [screaming] [warriors chanting] [crackling] [wind whooshes] [narrator] The war came to an end. For its victory over Emperor Zhou, Jingxu Hall was lauded. The Revered Master bequeathed unto the people gods tasked with the protection of all living things. With the rise of a new Dynasty, there was much to be done. Those loyal to the old order were banished to the icy ruins of Beihai, never to return. [wind whooshes] For his role in the triumph, Jiang Ziya was celebrated far and wide. It was thought he would lead the new gods. And yet... [squeaks] [clatters in distance] [squeaks] What'd I say? Why is that rock shaped so weird? When's the last time you've ever seen a rock around here? I'm gonna take a look. - Freeze! - [gasp] Things aren't... Whoa! Uh... [grunting] Ugh... [blows raspberry] That's no rock. It's one of the Immortals. - Immortals? - Immortals? Behold. Following the Great War, Jingxu Hall let down a stairway to heaven and invited mankind to ascend. The first person to climb it was none other than Jiang Ziya himself. That's how he became a god. [solemn music] [grandiose music] [gasps] I have completed the mission given to me. [Master A] Jiang Ziya. The Fox Devil you have subdued cannot be permitted to live. [Master B] As the Three Realms look on. Nine Tailed must be executed. By you. [Master C] With this act shall you secure your place as leader of the gods. [Master D] As you are a servant of the people, so shall the disciples of Jingxu Hall be yours to command in upholding Heaven's will. Then so it is done. [horns blowing] [metal chains creaking] [door opens] [foreboding music] [Nine Tailed sighs] [sobbing] [man 1] Kill her! - [man 2] Kill her! - [man 3] Kill her! - [man 4] Kill her! - [female] Kill her! [grunts] [disciples chanting] Kill! [disciples chanting] Kill! [disciples chanting] Kill! [disciples chanting] Kill! [heavy breathing] Nine Tailed. These illusions are fruitless. Your fate is sealed. This is how you end. So loyal. What right does your Master have to presume the will of Heaven? He has saved mankind from your evildoing. Has he indeed? Uh... [Nine Tailed] Very well. Why does he not move to save her? Who is that? You know nothing of the truth. This girl, she's... [Master A] Jiang Ziya! Do not let her sow the seeds of doubt in your mind! [Master B] Kill her! Prepare to meet your end! [dramatic music] [disciples chanting] Kill! [disciples chanting] Kill! [disciples chanting] Kill! Look out! [gasps] Her sorcery! [screams] [gasps] Resist the illusion! Stay pure! [cries] [screams] See me! Take off the mask! [all] Huh? Mark my words, you will be executed! [Nine Tailed laughs] If I die, she dies. [gasps] [sobbing] Save me. [gasps] Master, there is an innocent in her clutches! Huh! No, wait! [groans] [grunts] [laughing] [cries] Let her go! [children yelling] [grunts] Uh... [screams] Come on! Get it together! It's been long enough! I want to go home! [Master A] You have undone the seal. You must be punished. [Jiang Ziya] But I saw an innocent spirit within Nine Tailed. [Master B] Silence! What you saw was a conjuring trick! But is seemed so... [Master C] Were Nine Tailed loose in the mortal realm... [Master D] The devastations of the great war would have been for naught. [Master E] Fortunately, the Fox Devil has been executed. [masters] But you are hereby banished from Jingxu Hall! I know what I saw. [Revered Master] Jiang Ziya. [Jiang Ziya] Master. I have no choice but to seal your divine power and exile you to Beihai until such time as you are no longer in thrall to this wicked illusion. Only then may you return. [exhales] [Shen Gongbao] This job stinks. Emperor Zhou gets to be the God of Marriage, but me? I'm stuck looking after you. I'm a baby sitter! - [yelps] - Ah! Four-Alike? No! That's for the three of us to share! Oh, I see how it is! You wanna bite me! Fine! Huh! With a straight hook? This fish is as dumb as you are. What... Oh! You've got to be kidding me. Unbelievable. Look at you. They get to go home, meanwhile we're rooted to the spot! [groans] I'll do it! Uh... Wha... I'll break this thing into splinters! [grunting] Don't test me! Humph! [grunts] Stop! Do you want to go back to Jingxu Hall or not? Come on! It was all in your head! [exhales] Um... Nine Tailed played a trick on you. It's like that saying about flies only going for cracked eggs. Not that I'm, you know, calling you an egg or anything... - [Jiang Ziya] Go home. - Huh? You deserve better. It's been ten years. This is my punishment. Ugh... [gasps] [crashes] [wind whooshing] You're a damn fool. If it weren't for the Master's orders, I'd be long gone. [Four-Alike yelps] [gasps] Four-Alike. - Huh? - [growls] [chuckles] [gasps] [squeals] [exhales] [wind whooshes] [wind whooshes] [overlapping dialogue] I've got one eye. Two big mouths. Three whole arms. And four legs! [laughs] You lose! Look at these beauties! - What? - Drink! [laughter] Bunch of morons. [belches] What? You filthy urchin! - Mommy! He's bullying me! - Get back here! Which one of you lowlifes is picking on my child? I'll rip you apart! Excuse me? [grunting] Oh, oh... Oh. [crowd laughing] [yelps] Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! [grunts] - It burns! - [laughing] Stinking devils always causing trouble. Confiscate their weapons! Cowards! Nine Tailed would'a killed ya if you hadn't fled! She'd have taken you lot first! She can smell fear! Says the one who reeks of it! [all gasp] [wind swooshes] Jiang Ziya? Why is he here? Killjoy. [crowd whispering] Hmm... Huh... [giggles] [grunts] Oh-oh! If it isn't the big shot immortal who got us all imprisoned here! Huh? Excuse me. Humph. Well, hey! At least we're all in this together. Gotta be worse for you, though! Scum of the Three Realms ousted from Jingxu Hall! Oh, that's a good one! The scum of the Three Realms! - [crowd] Scum! - [beast] You hear that? [soldier 1] So what if you won the war? [soldier 2] You're still stuck here with all of us! Barkeep. How much for rice? [laughs] My, my. What a rare treat this is. Beihai is on a barter system. [chuckling] The Whip of the Gods would suffice! - [Jiang Ziya] What about this? - Hmm... Kunlun moire. Your, associate Shen Gongbao was here earlier, weeping himself silly. Ah. Poor fellow. Forced to trade his earring. [laughs] Did you two have a spat? Oh now, don't take it to heart. Ha! Life squeezes us one way or another. Get over it and move on, or lay down arms and accept defeat. Sometimes, the only thing standing between us and what we want is admitting we're wrong. [Master B]What you saw was a conjuring trick! [wind swooshes] Well. Someone likes making an entrance. [exhales] Step aside. You're a new face. Tell me, girl, are you looking for someone in particular or just trouble? [screams] Just trouble. Is that a fact? [crowd laughing] [soldier 3] Okay, okay! You win! [soldier 2] She's good. [soldier 1] Strong little one, eh? Huh? [clears throat] I'm looking for a place. It's her. Yeah? And what "place" might that be, missy? Somewhere very unique. Where the black flowers bloom. Black flowers? [horned man] Yeah, sorry. Not ringin' a bell. You seen anything like that before? Interesting. There is only one such place in the Three Realms. Mount Youdu, the traveler's despair! You know what I'm talking about? Where is it? Tell me! - Hmm. - Don't smirk. I know the score. [chuckles] Youdu was once a sacred mountain not so long ago. It's where Emperor Zhou was given the title "God of Marriage". Oh, how times have changed. Strange things are afoot. Black flowers thrive unchecked along the mountainside, hiding the path. All who search for it miss the mark. Ah, but lucky for you I just so happen to have a map. And of course, much more besides. I trade in rare beasts, souvenirs, travel essentials... Everything! - [coughs] - Yes. There sits Mount Youdu, in all its glory! - Let me see! - Not so fast! Just the other day, a group of downtrodden fox hunters tried to haggle for this item. If one credits their word, the mountain is haunted, by Fox Devils! [all gasp] But.. weren't they driven to extinction? If the Fox Devils have returned, the Three Realms will be thrown into chaos! Such a young thing you are. What business can you have with so frightful a place? That's none of your concern. Is the map for sale or isn't it? I appreciate your fire. But the first rule of negotiation dictates that all goods are subject to inspection! [yells] You stay out of this! What sort of despicable operation are you... [crowd laughing] [groans] You tried to trick me! [Jiu] Meddler. [gasps, scream] - [giggles] - What are you doing? Grab the wretch! - [grunts] - [barkeeper] What the? My inventory! [grunts] My Jingxu divination stone! [chattering] No! Wait! That's immortal wine! I've been saving it for years! You don't say? Well, then... It's worth sharing! [crowd screaming] Huh? - [man 1] Hey! - Wait I don't... [barkeeper] Someone stop her! Hands off! [barkeeper] I'll offer a reward! [gasps] The map! - [soldier 3] Someone catch it! - [man 2] Get the wine! That's a good boy. Just hand me the map. [gasps] No, no, no! - Spit it out! - [barkeeper] What are you... - waiting for? Take her down! - Spit it out right now! [barkeeper] Kill her if you have to! - [grunting] - Leave her be! Ugh! Very well! I'll do it myself! [groans] [gasps] Fox! [crowd gibbering] [gasps] Devil! [overlapping chatter] If we hand her over to Jingxu Hall, we're as good as freed! None of you get in my way! Be careful! They'll want the head intact! [overlapping chatter] Down there! [man 3] I see her! Don't let her get away! [soldier 4] Hurry! [grunts] Huh? [cries] Where do you think you're going? - Stop! - [Jiu] Huh? What is... Who are you? [Shen Gongbao] Jiang Ziya! Slow down! You're about to cross the boundary! [grunts] [whimpers] [Shen Gongbao] Good thing I can keep up. If you'd left Beihai, you'd be in defiance of the Master. And that would be bad. Really, really bad. Look, all that stuff I said earlier. I'm just trying to help! Hey, whoa! Whoa! Don't do it! [Jiang Ziya] I can only return to Jingxu Hall... by first uncovering the truth. Huh? Please! Be reasonable! Ah! He's starved. He's not thinking clearly. Uh... Okay. If I have to cross, then so be... [groans] Jiang Ziya's out of his mind. [sneezes] It's freezing. Get him inside. Ha! He's in league with the Fox Devil! [ominous music] - [snickering] - Huh? [whimpers] - [cries] - Huh! - [grunts] - [whimpers] Who are you? Give that back! [gasps] Speak. What is your connection to Nine Tailed? [heavy breathing] How far the mighty Jiang Ziya has fallen. Treating an innocent little girl like a common hoodlum. - Oh, save it! - Murderer! [growls] So much for being an immortal. Are all of you this unreasonable? If anyone's connected to the Fox Devil, it's you. [scoffs] So that bracelet? - Is none of your business! - It belonged to Nine Tailed. Why are you wearing it? What are you talking about? It belongs to me! Stop! [growling] Nine Tailed! [grunting] [Jiu] No! [groans] [screams] Spirit-taming fires, rise! [grunts] [both panting] What were those? What do they want with you? [pants] Excellent question. How the hell should I know? They've been after me from the moment I woke up. There's more every time. I'm guessing it has to do with my past. I don't really know. The only clue is this bracelet, and the memory of black flowers. Mount Youdu. Sometimes I can see my father. Waiting for me. He can prove I'm not a devil! [Master A] Do not let her sow the seeds of doubt. You're coming with me to Jingxu Hall! Are you listening? I have to find my father! [Jiang Ziya] He has saved mankind from your evildoing. You know nothing of the truth. [Reverend Master] I have no choice but to seal your divine power and exile you to Beihai until such time as you are no longer in thrall to this wicked illusion. [gasps] [yelps] [panting] What is this? Who are you? [muttering] - [belches] - [gasps] [sighs] Very well. Let's go. Where? To Mount Youdu. Wait, are you serious? [Jiang Ziya] Yes. Are you afraid? [Jiu] A-Afraid? What kind of question is that? And don't act all high and mighty, it's my map! Hey, wait up! - [whimpers] - That hasn't healed yet? I have something that might help. My secret recipe! [whimpers] It's yours. If you give me a peek at the map. - [growls] - [gasps] I thought we were friends! I wasn't aware we'd graduated to that. Whatever, it's only a matter of time. We just have to get to know each other. - [Jiu gasps] - [Jiang Ziya] Good idea. - Let's start with you. - Huh? You're not an immortal. So how did you cross into Beihai? - Uh... - [Four-Alike squeaks] That's kind of personal. - Are you normally this blunt? - Uh... Why I should even trust you? You're dressed like a vagrant. A desperate vagrant. For all I know you see me as a bounty. Huh? Ah! [gasps] And you see me as a mark. Uh, wait! Okay, okay, okay. - [sighs] - [squeaking] - You're so arrogant! That tone. - [growls] [growls] [Jiang Ziya] Four-Alike, that's enough. - Four-Alike? - [growls] So this is the legendary creature said to move with such grace? Fearsome? Big as the night sky? Makes men tremble? How adorable. - [spits] - [gasps] - [shushes] - [sucks teeth] Don't antagonize. It left Jingxu Hall on my account. [sighs] Oh sure. Sounds like a reasonable story. Or maybe it just couldn't cut it in Heaven. [gasps] Give that back! I was kidding! Four-Alike! Hey, tough guy! How 'bout you control your pet? Ugh! I'll slap a muzzle on that face! - [squeaks] - [pants] [Jiu] Get back here! [dramatic music] [Jiu] All right, fun's over! [Four-Alike squeaks] [Jiu] Don't you even! Those are mine! - [spits] - [groans] [Jiang Ziya] Four-Alike! Ugh! When I get my hands on you! Is that all immortals really are? A bunch of glorified thieves? First the map, now my biscuits. Huh? [screams] - [grunts] - [Jiang Ziya] Stop. Ugh! It's just a stupid wind chime. They're all over the place. Spirits are supposed to be comforted by the sound of bones rattling. Something like that, anyway. Like a consolation prize for being dead. Huh? These are messages from their loved ones. A connection to life. They're a comfort to the living and the dead. [bones rattling] The war is over. The Fox Clan has been defeated. The world is healing. - Rest in peace, all of you. - [whimpers] [scoffs] Sentimental crap if you ask me. [bones rattling] [snarls] [yawns] Ugh. That sedative knocked me out cold. Okay. Where's the stubborn bastard gone to? [gasps] He's hurt? Of course, he is! Damn it! [Jiang Ziya] "The Field of the Undying is known far and wide for its trees that don't die, flowers that don't wilt, and springs that don't run dry." [spits] Charming place. Blame it on the Great War. Everything changed. You know, if the heat's getting to you, I'm more than happy to navigate. [Jiang Ziya] Thank you, no. Get away! I don't have any food left! Uh, huh? [growls] [villager 1] Cut her ears off! [stranded man breathing heavily] - Uh... - [gasps] Water. I need water. [Jiang Ziya gasps] You can't do anything for him. There's barely enough for you. I'm not letting him die. That's all there is to it. [groans] Let go! Stop it! He doesn't deserve saving! - [grunts] - [stranded man] Fox! [grunting] [groans] The man's a fox hunter. He only sees me as game. Who came to my rescue when they tried to cut off my ears? [grunts] Whatever he is, he hasn't harmed you! Just give him the chance! - [Jiang Ziya] Don't! - [Jiu] Fine! Have it your way! [groaning] - Follow her. - [squeaks] Calm yourself. I only mean to help. Hear me, Five Emperors. Ye benevolent powers that govern the body, heed my command and heal this... The fox is mine, do you understand me? You can find your own on Mount Youdu. [stranded man groaning] Fox Devil. Damn your trickery. Mount Youdu it is. [Jiu] Once upon a time, there was an immortal from Heaven. Sadly, without his map, there wasn't a whole lot he could do. Huh? [squawks] [Jiu] Ravens. You guys always assume you're in charge. Till I snap your necks! - [squawks] - [gasps] [grunting] [ravens croaking] [rumbling] [gasps] [spirits moaning] Help! I want to go home! [growls] [Jiu] What the... Well, okay then... [grunts] What is this thing? Move! [grunts] [screams] [grunts] Get out of here! - Uh... - Take Four-Alike! Go! [grunting] [panting] [squeaks] Ha! Whoa! Come back! Idiots. [moans] [Jiang Ziya] I told her to get you out of here! [growls, squeaks] [Jiu] Stupid mutt! [panting] What are you doing? Quickly, give me the whip! - I'm trying! - Look out! Oh no! [groans] [grunts] [growls] [bones rattling] The wind chime. Give it the wind chime. [grunts] [pants] [both panting] Those things, were they human? At one time. - [Jiu] Huh? - [whimpers] [bones rattling] They're lost souls. Those who left home. Died on the battlefield. No graves. No friends or family. No hope of finding their way back. No way home? That's awful. [squeaks] Blame the Great War. [bones rattling] Will they be trapped here forever? Quite possibly. There's some hope for them, though. The Swallow. A great beast said to traverse the sky when moved by human grief. [exhales] [Jiang Ziya] When moved by human grief. [gasps] - [Jiu's father] Jiu. - [gasps] [panting] You okay? I have a home and a family. My father's waiting. - I'll find him. - Huh? [whimpers] This will be able to calm your wound. The map. What'll we do without it? [squeaks] [squeaks] [squeaks] [growls] - [squeaks] - [giggles] [Jiu] Silly creature. - [Jiu laughs] - [sighs] [Jiu] Yeah, you're pretty cute. [Jiu laughs] [bones rattling] [thunder rumbling] [clanking] [moans] [Jiu] Ha! [gasps] Uh... [Jiu gasps] Father... Get inside. - [Jiu groans] - Devil. He's only a child! [villager 1] Fox Devil! Get her! Don't let her get away! - [overlapping dialogue] - [grunting] Give him the knife. Let him do it. [whimpering] [villager 2] Cut her ears off! [gasps] [panting] [Jiu sighs] A nightmare? [Jiang Ziya] "May you sleep the sleep of the just..." [gasps] That's the most practical chant I've ever heard. Is it like a traditional one? It's not exactly a chant. [squeaks] [Jiyang Ziya] It's from the Great War. Soldiers used to say it before bed. The Great War. Was Four-Alike part of it? The last time we were here, all this was ocean. Four-Alike crossed it with a single step and shattered enemy ranks. Vanquish Nine Tailed, and the world would be restored. At least that's what we all told ourselves. But it didn't work out that way. The world just fell into greater ruin. You think this place had it bad. You should see where I'm from. [clears throat] Uh, of course, I'm kidding. Actually, I bet you'll think it's beautiful. So, you know, worth the journey. What are the odds your father is still there? Uh... [sighs] Really wish I could tell you. I haven't been able to remember anything. Not since waking up in the desert. [sighs] I dream, though. About this doll he made. A little thing. All strung with stones. Just clinking away in the breeze. It was like a windchime. [windchime rattling] Calling me home. [windchime rattling] [sighs] Whenever I'd sneak away, he'd hang it above the front door. The wind would pick up. And I'd follow the sound back. Jiu. In the dream that's what he calls me. And the place where the black flowers bloom? That's where he's waiting. It's not just a dream. It's real. My whole purpose in life. You better believe I'll find him. [wind swishing] Huh... [gasps] [Jiang Ziya] It's the Swallow. [spirits giggling] [spirits giggling] - [gasps] - [spirits laughing] [squeaks] The restless souls have been called home. The Swallow has given them hope. [Jiu gasps] [peaceful music] Shall we go? According to the map the tail of the Milky Way points to Mount Youdu. [exhales] Now we're friends. Eat up, you'll need it. Impressive memory. [squeaks] Stop sniffing at me. I don't have any more biscuits. [squeaks] Except that one! That one's mine! Give it back! Ugh! [Jiang Ziya] "When you see the Stone Forest, follow Heishui upstream." The entrance to Mount Youdu must be up ahead. [Jiu sighs] Are you sure? All I see is a bunch of rocks. And dirt. - I'm sure. - [squeaks] There's more here than meets the eye. Black flowers? We've gotta be close! [growling] Watch out! [explosion] [Shen Gongabo] Jiang Ziya! [explosion] Where the hell do you think you're going? You can't just leave Beihai! Rules are rules! Rules you've now broken too. I had no choice! The Fox Devil was making an idiot of you! - Let's go back before... - I can't go back yet. Wha... I, uh, think you're buddy's about to explode. - [grunts] - Jiang Ziya! Your face. That wound should've healed! C'mon, your powers are dwindling. Damn it. Do you wanna die out here? I will return to Beihai... when I have uncovered the truth. Truth about what? She's the girl I found in Nine Tailed clutches. I have to know who she is. Huh? Uh... This is her? - Why are you so an... - Speak! - [Jiang Ziya] Put her down! - What are you? You've been possessed. Let go! I don't have to tell you anything! Stubborn, aren't we? - Show me your true form! - Shen Gongbao! [grunts] [screams] Four-Alike! Huh? - Get back here? - Stop! Four-Alike. Where are you? Four-Alike! Huh... Uh... - Uh? - [Zhou] Over here. This way. Father? Is that you? Father! [groaning] [yelps] Use your head. How many lives did the Fox Devil destroy? If the truth is so important to you, open your eyes! [grunting] - Things aren't what they seem! - Bullshit! We've been down this road before! You are hopeless! [gasps] [Zhou clicks tongue] That which is inescapable we call fate. That which is unbreakable we call love. [hanging man screams] Father, is that you? [Zhou] "Father?" [laughs] Foolish child, I am not your father. - Humph. Who are you? - Ooh, what a question! [laughs] I bind the fates of mortals together. I am the God of Marriage! [laughs] You're deranged! Untie me! [Zhou] As you wish. [screams] [pants] Your face is so exquisitely familiar. - Uh, ah... - [Jiu grunts] The Lock of Destiny? - You recognize my bracelet? - [Zhou laughs] How could I not? [grunts] It isn't a bracelet. See. It's a very powerful lock. What? It binds two spirits together inexorably. If one should perish, then so shall the other! My beloved consort wore the companion to this very lock on her person, which can only mean the two of you are bound together eternally! When the chain materializes, I'll be able to find her again! [yelps] - [laughs] - [groans] [laughs] Materialize, my love! [cries] [yells] Jiu! [gasps] Don't you run away from me! Where are you? Come to me! [grunting] Son of a... Why do you keep making the same mistakes? [Jiu screams] You're the Fox Devil that cost my beloved her life! - [grunts] - [groaning] Jiu! [groans] [screams] Look out! [grunting] [sobbing] [squeaking] [pants] [exhales deeply] - Sorcery. - You see it now? It's her. She's... Why? Why murder the woman I cherished? Why destroy my kingdom? She did this. It's all her doing. What you see is evil incarnate. [Jiu whimpers] [Zhou] Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. [whimpers] No one is waiting for you anywhere. I have to find my father. - [squeaking] - [screaming] Jiu! Stop! Kill her! Kill her! No. If she dies so will my love! [foreboding music] Aah... [laughs] Jiang Ziya. How long has it been? [spirits screaming] Nine Tailed. It's you. Didn't the holy device behead you? Jiang Ziya saved me. Let her go! Release her! [grunts] Ha! [grunts] My mortal body was indeed beheaded. But as long as my spirit endures taking physical form is simple! Enough! Foul sorceress! No one cares! [laughs] Where did this precious kitty come from? Watch out! Ten short years. That's all it's taken for you to sink this low, Jiang Ziya. How utterly heartbreaking. Don't you find that sad? Jiu? Oh, forgive me. I should call you Su Daji. - [gasps] - My beloved. Behold. The Zu family's eldest daughter. Betrothed to Emperor Zhou. Such a simple human girl. [muffled cry] [gasps] - Wha... - Hmm... What have you done with my father? [laughs] Think carefully, child. The memory will come to you. Is that you? Uh... Father, what? [Jiu's father] Go. [Nine Tailed] I crept into your ceremonial carriage and took your shape for my own. And I becamethe Emperor's cherished consort. And yet... This lock was meant to tether you. Binding you to me forever. [grunts] Your spirit is strong. It escaped, taking with it your former body and a small measure of my power. And now? You must return! - [screams] - Stop! [groans] [growls] [growls] Cursed feline! [grunts] [growls] [Jiang Ziya] Hiya! [pants] [Jiang Ziya] Master? [laughs] Alas, a lock forged by the Revered Master is not for the likes of you to break. My Power. My Power! Shit! Her power's coming back! Master. The truth... - I have to know. - [Shen Gongbao] Don't listen! She wants to confuse you! Don't give credence to her lies! You dare call me a liar? Heaven is meant to protect all living things. Have you any notion of the atrocities committed by your Revered Master? Shen Gongbao! [grunts] That said. If not for Jiang Ziya's kindness toward one in peril, never would I have had the opportunity to break free. It's a pity you're so mired that truth eludes you. - Let them go. - Don't despair, child. I won't kill you. [screams] [Nine Tailed laughing] Jiu! Four-Alike! [grunts] [Zhou] Conceal. - The lock! - Run! You're not going anywhere! Faster! [yells] The lock remains! You cannot hope to save her! There is no escape! The Fox Clan will rise again! [moans] - [Jiu] You were right. - Huh? No one's... No one's... waiting for me. Four-Alike, what's wrong! Watch out! Jiu! [grunts] [groans] Four-Alike! Huh... No. [pants] Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command. Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command. Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command. Eight Effulgences... [gasping] Just hold on. [groans] [sobbing] [both gasp] What's happening? [sobs] [cries] Four-Alike. [Jiu cries] [squeaks] - [sobbing] - [squeaking] [sobbing] [giggles] [cries] Fore-Alike. [sniffs] [squeaks] [giggles] [sobs] [cries] [sniffles] [cries] [squeals] [gasping] Where are you? [growls] There you are. [Zhou] My love. What is the world coming to, when even you can become a deity? Return her to me. Your consort is as dead as your legacy. Farewell. All these years... people thought you were bewitched. In the end, we were the fools. Jingxu Hall will eliminate Nine Tailed. But if the Lock of Destiny isn't broken. If Nine Tailed dies, she'll die, too, Won't she? I don't get it. If the Master forged it with his own hands, what are we supposed to do? What do we even believe? Why don't we go to the source? I'll speak with him myself and have the lock undone. [gasps] Appear! [heavy breathing] They won't lower the stairway for you anymore. - [sighs] - Wait. It's too costly! You're not alone in this. Go to them. Find the answer! [rumbling] [rumbling] I seek the Revered Master. [Master A] Presumption. [Master B] You were ordered to contemplate your errors. And instead, you chose to leave. You should be punished. [Jiang Ziya] Which I accept willingly. But Nine Tailed lives. Her spirit tied to an innocent. The master knows the truth! [Master A] Silence! [Master C] You may not pass! If he has nothing to hide then why will he not speak to me? [Master B] How dare you! [Jiang Ziya] Did you fasten the Lock of Destiny? Does Nine Tailed share your blood? Is this the way of Heaven? Would you sacrifice a child? [wind swooshes] [gasps] Master. Jiang Ziya. Everything Jingxu Hall does, it does with the sole aim of protecting life. Tell me, please. Why would you have me believe what I saw was a mere illusion? Because the scope of your understanding is small. Your heart is kind. But your compassion, scattered. Your sense of the greater good is skewed. I ordered you to execute Nine Tailed. Not to crush evil, but kindness. Crush kindness? But, what is wrong with kindness? In itself, nothing. But, alas, for gods... Kindness shown to one person only is a sin. One day there will come a time when a god must sacrifice one to save all. [masters] Jiang Ziya must return to Beihai immediately. Once his mind is free of illusion. He may return to his rightful place as leader of the gods and protector of the Three Realms. [Jiang Ziya] If I fail to save one life, how can I save all? [Master B] Insolence! [Master A] You would put one life above all else? They're all connected. Like drops of water. Life is an ocean. In my eyes, Jiu, and all living things, are one and the same. The great war ripped untold soldiers from home and family. I'm ashamed of my role. I no longer want to be a god. To have power. All I want is to save whoever I'm able. I see. You are certain of this? [exhales deeply] Once the Lock of Destiny is fastened it cannot be undone in the same lifetime. The only answer... Is reincarnation. Escort Su Daji to the Ruins of Return. Let her step into the light and be reborn. Thank you, Revered Master. [dramatic music] [panting] [Jiang Ziya] Is this it? [sighs] [creaking] [crashes] [wind whooshes] [both gasp] Nine Tailed! Run! [sighs] Go without me. [gasps] Shen. - I... - Just go. Do what has to be done. Save her... and come home. Of course. [growls] [pants] [grunts] [growls] [grunts] [groans] [grunts] [groans] [growls] Uh... [Shen Gongbao] Don't you want to be a god? [Jiang Ziya] No. Go on. You've stood by me long enough. Report back to the master. - [Shen Gongbao] Ugh. - [Jiang Ziya]Do as I say. [Shen Gongbao] I came here without his permission... Jiang Ziya. I used to be so jealous. You were the Master's favorite. Everyone loved you. But I get it now. You didn't become a hero. You've always been one. But this time... it's my turn. [Jiang Ziya panting] [gentle music] [moans] [leaves rustling] Jiang Ziya. Yes? Where are you taking us? To break the lock. You're going to be reborn. Reborn as what? [gasping] How do you like that? I'm right back at where I started. Empty-handed. When I opened by eyes all I could see were ruins. Whoever I met. Just wanted to hurt me. I tried to tell them... I said I wasn't a Fox Devil. [Jiu inhales deeply] But they wouldn't believe me. In the next life you'll be a perfectly ordinary child. With friends. Family. A father who loves and cares for you. Don't do that. Don't fill my head with lies. I'd never do that. [Jiang Ziya panting] [sobbing] [somber music] [sobs] Goodbye. [sighs] Huh. [gasps] [boy laughing] [gasps] Jiang Ziya. Thank you... [gasps] - [growls] - [gasps] [snarls] [growls] [tense music] Damn you, Nine Tailed. Let it be finished! [screams] [grunts] [growls] [yells] [grunts] [Jiang Ziya] The lock has been broken. She is no longer bound to you. [grunts] [groans] [grunts] [growls] [groans] Let her... be reborn! [snarls] Reborn? [laughs] You're insane! [grunts] [laughing] Surely you didn't think I would release her so easily? Stop this! The world must know. People must see what the Revered Master has done! [laughs] Arise, my fox brethren! [grunts] [bull beast] Why the hell is my eye twitching? I've had two drinks. Maybe. It's a sign of good fortune! [gasps] [murmuring] What the? [fox spirits screaming] [explosion] Behold. These are my fox brethren. Thousands of them! Why are their souls restless? Years ago the Master made a promise. He told me I would become a god. But there was a price. I had to bind the Fox Clan to mortals and launch a war that would unite the Three Realms. [gasps] [Nine Tailed] Little did we know. When all was said and done the master reneged our bargain. He ordered our genocide. We were thrown into the bottomless pit. Never again to see the light. - Never to be reborn. - Oh... We were the true casualties of the Revered Master's ultimate war. I believed him. In a moment of greed, I doomed my own kind! [grunts] This cannot be. [Nine Tailed] Today, the Revered Master shall know the pain he wreaked upon the Fox Clan. The Three Realms will tremble at the sight of our true power! Ah! Jiu! [growls] [pants] [fox spirits shouting] [fox spirit] Release me from this prison! [fox spirit 2] Kill her! [child fox spirit] Undo the lock. [fox spirit 3] Kill her! Jiu! [grunts] [grunting] [growls] Whoa! Jiu! [Master B] Revered Master. We beg you to reconsider! [Reverend Master] What I do, I do for the greater good. [growling] [grunts] [fox spirits screaming] Jiu. I won't. [grunts] [wind swooshing] [inhales deeply] [Four-Alike squeaks] [tinkles] [wind whistling] As long as the Lock of Destiny exists, you cannot save anyone. In times to come, others will repeat our mistake. [warriors screaming in distance] [bones rattling] [Jiu] When I'm reborn, will I really have a father who loves me? [exhales] [Jiang Ziya] No one should be denied salvation. Not gods. Not devils. Not mortals. We all deserve to live free from the yoke of oppression. We all deserve the truth. [spirit 5] The lock has been undone. - [moans] - [spirits murmuring] [boy spirit] Father, Mother. Can we go home now? - Save me. - Release me from this hell. [growls] [screaming] Jiu! Ah... Jiang Ziya. [grunts] [Jiang Ziya grunts] [dreamy music] [sobbing] Have I been reborn yet? [explosion] [rumbling] [somber music] [sighs] [inhales deeply] [spirits whispering] [Jiu] Don't do that. Don't fill my head with lies. [gasps] [Master A] Head Disciple Jiang Ziya has achieved merit by luring out and vanquishing the Fox Devil once and for all. [Master B] He may now reclaim his place as leader of the gods. [sighs] One lock remains to be severed. [dramatic music] I, Jiang Ziya, herby vow to follow the Master. In everything. To lead the gods, and protect all life. To become a true god. Stand apart. Forge your own path. [Master A] The Grand Duke has ascended. All deities, fall back. [Master B] Approach, Jiang Ziya. Kneel before heaven to be cleansed and deified. Kneel! [masters] Impudence! [Master B] There was no choice. The Fox Devil was pure evil. Search your heart. My actions were a gift to the world. [Jiang Ziya] Henceforth, may no one lose their home. May no one be deceived. Let injustice... be a thing of the past! [grunts] [Master B] You've gone mad! If the stairway crumbles, the world shall be cut off from divine protection! [crackling] What have you done? [crackling] [dramatic music] [villagers murmuring] [Shen Gongbao] And so, Jiang Ziya demolished the Stairway and the Revered Master was punished by Heaven. The Swallow descended and guided restless souls home. Once again, the world saw peace and hope restored. [child] When I grow up, I want to be a hero just like that! Master. Where does the Swallow come from? Where indeed? A place far above even Jingxu Hall. In the great beyond. Where your master's master dwells. [child] Wow. So the master's master is the Revered Master. And the Revered Master's master is... [villager 3] Great Revered Master! [villager 4] Hush! His name isn't for you to say. He is the great deity far above the Ninth Heaven and sends the Swallow to earth. [villager 5] Jiang Ziya sure is amazing! Even the Great Revered Master lent him a hand. As expected of my "good friend." [villagers 6] Your good friend? You can search all of Beihai and find no one closer to Jiang Ziya than me! - [barks] - [villaer 7] Cut the crap. Your only good friend is drink. [villagers 5] Hard to believe Beihai is finally at peace. [barking] [growls] [munches] [barks] [girl] ♪ A bite of biscuit A bite of sweets ♪ ♪ Outside Beihai ♪ [girl gasps] ♪ Yellow fields of wheat ♪ ♪ Mother and Father Sitting by my side ♪ ♪ Humming a tune As I drift into a dreamland ♪ [barking] [girl] What are those hanging from the tree? What a pretty sound! I want one for my doll too! [giggles] Hmm. [laughs] [bones rattling] [villager 5] Speaking of Jiang Ziya, where exactly has he gone? [villager 8] Far outside the Three Realms. To a place known as the City of Tribulation, is said to be a prison built expressly for gods of his stature. [god] My Lord... the Great Revered Master sends us... We've been order to take up posts. PLEASE WAIT, THERE'S A POST-CREDITS SCENE! [somber music] THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR WAITING! LET'S MAKE UP FOR THE YEAR TOGETHER! Huh! [fireworks crackling] [blows] [clears throat] Humph. [gasps] [gasps] Ugh. [glass shatters] [gasps] [exhales deeply] Ugh... [gasps] [panting] [grunts] [panting] Uh... Mm... Mm-hm. [gasps] [snickers] [groaning] [grunts] Huh? Uh, huh... May you live long! [all] May we meet again when the storm has passed. Wishing you peace and good fortune in the times ahead. [laughter] ONE WAR TO DEIFICATION
