MUSIC COMMENTATOR: He doesn't miss those. What a fantastic goal. fantastic goal. Who else, Ashley Barnes again. Oh, what a strike! Crouch, the 100th Premier League goal. Yes, plenty of top goal-scorers in action in today's Premier League games, and in the studio one of the game's most popular strikers. Alan is here as well. It was too easy, too easy! We begin at Tottenham. Newcastle United the visitors, with Steve Bruce looking to avoid a third consecutive defeat. Commentary comes from Martin Fisher. Steve Bruce wasn't a popular choice when he was appointed to replace Rafa Benitez in the summer and that dissent has only intensified in the wake of their sorry show at Norwich. Coming here is probably the last thing that he needs. They point must have given Tottenham fresh belief may be this season they can get close to the champions. Lucas, who got the Etihad equaliser, is rewarded with a start. Son Heung-Min is involved for the first time having completed his three match ban, hanging over from last season. Eriksen drops to the bench. Newcastle's £40 million man Joelinton is in after recovering from a knock. Local lad stuff is preferred to Shelvey in midfield. -- local lad Longstaff. Winks got away with that. Rose, Lamela. Rose lifts it in. It's Lascelles who heads away. And Almiron was penalised for tugging the jersey of Rose. Who stopped, knowing that the whistle would come. Free kick quickly taken at Spurs just try to inject a bit of pace and there might be a chance for Son Heung-Min. Goes down under the challenge. The supporters howling for a penalty. Schar sliding in, did he get his toe to the ball? Mike Dean didn't see it as a penalty. Schar looking for Joelinton. He's got Longstaff up with him, they've got two to his left. It was on target, firmly struck, good save by Lloris. It's a really good strike by Longstaff. It needed saving. Newcastle almost had the audacity to take the lead. Here's Atsu. Looking for Joelinton and he's found him as well. What a chance. And Joelinton puts it away! Newcastle's £14 million man celebrates his first goal for the club. It's a tight one. But beautifully collected by Joelinton. Rose coming in with a sliding challenge, couldn't make it in time, and Joelinton Hammers home. Spurs nil, Newcastle one. Rose for Son Heung-Min. Son Heung-Min. Son Heung-Min's ball in. Walker-Peters, Kane is in the middle waiting. So too is Lucas, so is Son Heung-Min. is Son Heung-Min. Better from Spurs. Sissoko, saw a gap and glides through it. Now Lucas, challenged by Lascelles. Reclaimed by Walker-Peters. Winks momentarily slowed it down before picking a pass for Lamela. Going through the gears now, Tottenham. Lamela, Lucas, and Dummett gets to it first. Brilliant defending from Newcastle. Walker-Peters fires it in, Lascelles away this side. Alderweireld. Lamela couldn't bring it down. Well, there is a steely determination about Newcastle now. Dubravka involved for the first time, and it's a really good save. Even then there was a lot on the line, at the goalkeeper not got across, how about this from Paul Dummett? Missed that, and Lucas is in. Lascelles underneath it, where's dropping? Son Heung-Min will try and keep it alive. Rose, Kane. He's found a cross, Dubravka touches. Lucas couldn't get his shot away and it's that man, Christian Atsu, who did enough to make the challenge to prevent Lucas getting a free hit. Joelinton was met goal divides the team at the break will stop -- Joelinton's goal divides the teams at the break. Lamela. Son Heung-Min, may be a chance of a shot here, scuffed it, but it dropped to Lamela. What a challenge by Schar. Schar, Lascelles and Dummett have performed heroically when called upon. Predictably pretty much all the action the second half has been in the Newcastle half, but Spurs just haven't done enough with that position. So many balls past Square. Son. Being false to weigh again by Newcastle. Alderweireld. It's Lascelles who heads clear. Son Heung-Min. Lo Celso. If the fans are frustrated, how about him? So pedestrian from his side. A lack of imagination, lack of craft. Winks, Lo Celso, that's better, Kane, the challenge, is that a penalty? Well, surely VIR will have a look at that because it looked as though Lascelles just dived into Kane. Kane goes down. Had little option but to do so. Did his best to make it look accidental, but certainly interrupted Kane's movement towards the ball. I can't really see what the debate is about here. What is the decision? No penalty. I think Jamal Lascelles here is very clever. He slipped there, knows he can't get to the ball, knows he has to stop Kane doing so and just dives across his path. It gets harder for Tottenham next week, they are down the road at Arsenal and they'll certainly have to play a lot, lot better than this. Eriksen looking for Sissoko. He's found a cross, Lucas, what a chance for the Brazilian. Last week was my hero fluffed his lines. -- last week's hero fluffed his lines and NewcastleMcLean sheet remains intact and Lucas, unmarked, but off target. He is Eriksen. Away by Fernandez and now it's Almiron. Joelinton ahead of him to the right, if he waits to his left he's got Atsu, instead it's Joelinton who is running on empty. Almiron, good effort, deflection took it over. Well, he's still searching for his first Newcastle goal, Almiron. Signed back in January. Let this one go, I think he thought he had found his first go. The noise now from the Newcastle fans, who can't quite believe what they seem, but it's not over yet. It's Lucas, it's Alderweireld. Now Sissoko. Lucas screaming for it. Now he's got it. Back to Sissoko. Kane is there and he's miscued. Sums it up from Tottenham. His first chance of the game and Harry Kane, of all people, scuffs it. Sissoko. Literally the last few seconds. Lucas, and now Davies. It's not over yet. It should be now. It is. It's all over. What a fantastic result for Steve Bruce. So much criticism rained down on the new Newcastle manager after that defeat at Norwich, but he produced a superb team performance today. Defensive masterclass. Tottenham nil, Newcastle one. The great thing about Newcastle is everybody wants a bit of the great club it is. We've had to ride the storm not just for the past week, for the past five or six weeks. To a man, they were excellent today. I put praise on them and of course the staff, who have worked with me all week to try and quieten the storm, if with me all week to try and quieten the storm, if that's the right word, but hopefully that will shut a few people up for a little bit anyway. We came with a game plan. We were compact, we were narrow, and we caused them a few problems going forward when we hit them on the break and stuff. We had a game plan from start to finish and we managed to not give them any chances and it's been a massive three points. I feel disappointed like everyone, but we didn't play well. It was impossible to break down their organisation. Of course we conceded a cheap goal and you need some players to step up this type of situation, but we didn't, we didn't. We didn't show the quality today. We have to be strong with this situation and find a better solution than today. Should you have had a penalty today? No, I don't know, but I trust VAR. I don't want to complain, I didn't say nothing, it's not for us. We accept the rules. I'm happy because it's an element that is going to help the referee and I don't want to talk about it. To come to one of the big stadiums in Europe now, and a big, big team and turn them over in their backyard was very welcome. You were very nervous for the last 20 minutes, it was entertaining viewing for myself and Peter watching that! Now you've calmed down, where do you want to praise Newcastle? I want to place the setup. The whole team deserve praise. Totally opposite to what we saw last praise. Totally opposite to what we saw last week at Norwich. Today, they were very, very well organised, they were disciplined. So many positives from everyone in the team. That was the system they played, five, then the four in front of them, to give them the protection. There were no spaces whatsoever. But it wasn't just about defending. Look, you've got the four attack is there, you've got long staff, watch him there make the run. Almiron goes short. It's a wonderful run from Joelinton under great pass down the line. I mentioned long staff. He ran all that way, he's got the option to cross it, he takes the option to have a pop at goal and it's a decent save from Norris. But that was a constant. Getting players in and around in behind the ball, as I said, knows is whatsoever. If you don't win the first one of the second one there someone else in there as well, Lascelles on this occasion. This was the goal, very well worked. Again, you are committing men forward, comes out to that left-hand side and it's a good ball from Atsu, good run, great first touch, even better finish from Joelinton. Off is a mark, full of confidence. The second half that didn't change either. Again, if you don't win the first one and no surprise who blocks this, Paul Dummett, who I thought was absolutely magnificent the whole game. As I said, credit to the manager because he set a system up there and it worked to perfection. So they have done tactical work this week. Some of the criticism had come their way, they didn't know what they were doing and to him, this week, that performance proved them wrong. Last week's performance deserves criticism but you always have the chance to put that right in the next performance and they did that and it worked perfectly for the manager and for his staff today, and for the players to go out and say, yeah, you tell us what to do and we'll go and do it and I thought the whole team, from the goalkeeper right the way to the centre forward, from the first minute to the last minute, they gave everything. The gold from the Spurs' point of view, from your point of view first and then Peter Bosz my of view. I don't think everything is rosy at Tottenham Hotspur, we saw the manager in the summer saying, don't ask me about players coming in or leaving, it has got nothing to do with me. Then he complains about the transfer window, you leave to have your best players on the bench. People go on about the lack of creativity against Tottenham, they did it against Aston Villa, bringing on Christian Eriksen, exactly the same today, it didn't work. The biggest concern for me would be the way they are conceding. Have a look at this goal, the lack of effort from Tottenham players. Very well-worked for Newcastle, but look, not once in this whole build-up, from start to finish, does any Tottenham player break into a sprint. Not one player gets within 15 yards of any Newcastle player. Jogging, not good enough, lazy, not working hard enough. And before they know it, the ball is in the back of the net. That would be the bigger issue for me. But could they have been told to hold their shape, shuffle across and don't press because not every team presses all the time? No, you've got to remember they are at home to Newcastle, Tottenham are expected to win this game, and the intensity wasn't there. I have to agree with Alan. If we go back to Newcastle, and concerns over the summer, Perez was sold to Leicester, Rondon left as well, so now they have Joelinton in there. It is early days, but have they got someone to carry an attacking threat? I really enjoyed his performance today, I have to say. I know he had a tough time last week but this week, I thought he showed a lot of character, he's big and strong, it wasn't just the gold today, his first touch here was exquisite, took Danny Rose out of the game. But his all-round game, I thought he was strong, he held it up, looking for the ball again here. Here again, the pass, Alan was shouting, I think he said, bang! He did! I'm sure Alan could have done slightly better there. But I liked his hold-up play, his strength, when you've got the pace of Almiron, you need to bring him into the play. This one, his defence would have absolutely loved, you can't put a value on this, his defence have worked so hard to get the result and he is there battling three or four men, probably a little bit over exuberant, but to... He is more than a lump, isn't he? Yeah, much more than that, I think he has got good technique, he can play. He is not the finished article but I feel like Steve Bruce has got a player who he can mould into the shape that he wants him to be. Let's do the penalty and VAR, then. Well, we were all in the room today, seven or eight of us and half of us were saying no penalty, half of them were saying, yes, penalty. So, if the referee gives a penalty, we look back and say, Oakleigh VAR, not going to change that. But because also he doesn't give it, because of the high bar they are setting, they are not going to change that. Not everyone agrees so it is not clear and obvious. Harry Kane is trying to lean into the defender, looking for the contact. Yes, he goes down, and there is contact, but I have to say that I didn't think it was a penalty. For me, I think Lascelles knows what he's doing, he thinks Harry Kane is about to have a shot, dives across him to block the shot, and that was how Newcastle defended today, genuinely wanting to block the shot, and if he can't, he has taken the man, and in my opinion, it was a penalty, but we have not been agreeing on it, so how can VAR agree on it? The point being that VAR is not there to re-referee the game. Once he has made the decision, I don't think VAR is going to change it, whichever way it was. Onto the champions, and their visit to Bournemouth, who had never beaten them in the league. In fact Eddie Howe's side didn't even have a shot in this fixture last season. Commentary from Simon Brotherton. Denied what they thought was a late winner against Tottenham last weekend, Manchester City will be looking to avoid any such drama today. Bournemouth bring in one extra defensive player as they look for a first ever Premier League point against today's opponents, Chris Mepham coming in for Harry Wilson. David Silva makes his 400th appearance for Manchester City afternoon and his preference presence in preference to Rodri in midfield is the only change. Gabriel Jesus is not in the squad due to a hamstring injury. Bournemouth looking to build on that away victory against newly promoted Aston Villa last week. This is De Bruyne, who is muscled out of it. Josh King powering forward, unleashing the shot... Positive start from, and how's side. De Bruyne, a little ponderous. Almost made to pay for it. Comfortable for Ederson, straight at him. Bournemouth's problem the last time these teams met was getting hold of the ball, never mind doing anything with it. Silva, into Sterling... And just wide via a deflection. First glimpse of the menace of Manchester City, as they venture forward into the final third. Deflection just takes it wide. Guardiola, whose team have not been beaten in the Premier League since the end of January, St since the end of January, St James' park against Newcastle. Miscued from De Bruyne, but it matters not because it fell to the feet of Sergio Aguero. And in the blink of an eye, it is in the back of the Bournemouth net. With just under 15 minutes played, Manchester City have the lead. Lovely, short passing, Silva sending it wide, the miscue falling at the feet of Aguero. And he finds the bottom corner. Sergio Aguero has scored in all three of Manchester City's league matches so far this season. Bernardo Silva, faced by Nathan Ake. Nicely done. Aguero. Plenty of blue shirted support in and around the penalty area. Daniels didn't know where it had gone. Lovely shot on the volley from the David Silva. Bournemouth survive. This match really is settling into a familiar pattern now after the early flurry from Bournemouth. His team very much on top so far, but still just a one goal game. The ball finds its way to Harry Wilson. Zinchenko's touch merely finding the. merely finding the. King. Harry Wilson loitering beyond Zinchenko. Bournemouth trying to find a way back into the match before the break. Deflection, Otamendi... And it is over the top of the bar! Adam Smith can't quite believe it is not in the back of the net. And neither can most of the other people in the ground. Bournemouth close to an equaliser here, hesitation in the Manchester City defence. It hits the head of the Manchester City goalkeeper. David Silva, lovely touch, into Raheem Sterling... Oh, it's a brilliant goal! Fantastic play from the champions. And Raheem Sterling keeps his goalscoring run going. A hat-trick at West Ham in the opening game, a goal against Tottenham last week and another one here in Bournemouth. The pass into David Silva, who picks out Raheem Sterling, and the finish, lethal. Chris Mepham, in towards Callum Wilson... Challenged by Emerick Laporte, who protests his innocence. Andre Marriner was looking straight at that and Bournemouth have a free kick from within range. Harry Wilson and Lerma near the ball. Oh, what a goal, brilliant strike from Harry Wilson! Who marks his home debut for Bournemouth by finding the back of Ederson's net! Two goals in two appearances for his new club, the Saab gets Bournemouth on the board. Tremendous strike, up and over the wall and tantalisingly beyond the outstretched fingers of Ederson. This is Ilkay Gundogan. Zinchenko slides it in, David Silva with the shot. Only half cleared. Here's Kevin De Bruyne. Zinchenko... Ants turning -- and Sterling almost. Blocked by Steve Cook. 11 goals in his career in all competitions against Bournemouth for Raheem Sterling. He has got more against Bournemouth than anyone else. Looking to make it a dozen with that one. He will not be sitting comfortable at 2-1, but quite an animated figure in the technical area. Ball forward by Wilson, bursting forward, Callum Wilson. The block is made and Manchester City clear. Harry Wilson and Callum Wilson almost combining to bring Bournemouth right back into this one. Nathan Ake unable to make a clean contact. Aguero and De Bruyne putting the pressure on between the pair of them, they're almost going to walk it into the net... It was a lovely interchange. But here at the other end of the pitch, Bournemouth were close to drawing level. Now it's with David Silva. Silva once more. Tight angle for Sterling. David Silva goes down inside the penalty area. Referee waved play on and Billing brings it out. Bournemouth will put the ball out of play. The challenge made by Jefferson Lerma on David Silva, did he catch the top of his foot and send him sprawling? send him sprawling? Yeah, Jefferson Lerma onto the top of David Silva's boot. And the decision is no penalty, after a VAR review. It did look as if he caught the top of the Manchester City player's boot. I think the feeling at Stockley park was that clearly there is a high bar on changing decisions for penalties, and they felt it wasn't clear and obvious, so therefore it didn't meet their criteria for changing the initial decision. Manchester City venturing forward again now. Aguero! Jabbed the ball home! His second of the game, Manchester City's third, and the champions' two goal cushion is restored. Any hint of an opportunity near the goal will be gobbled up by Aguero, nine times out of ten. And that again was the case here. Aguero's second of the game. Maybe one last chance to attack the Manchester City goal, good play by Ibe, not quite such a good cross. David Silva sees out the time, and there goes the final whistle. Three goals, three points, for Manchester City. Sergio Aguero, the star, with two goals, Raheem Sterling with yet another one against Bournemouth. It is Manchester City who returned to winning ways, a 3-1 win on the road for Pep Guardiola's side on the south coast. Three goals this afternoon and three points, what were your thoughts on the way your team played? Tough game, we knew it, the physicality of the team, the system they play, the long balls, so it was a tough game. I think we did well today, you know it's going to be a tough game and the game we saw was probably what we thought it would be, but the big difference this time was that although we didn't have a great deal of possession, we certainly had our chances to score in the match. And they ultimately change games and we just weren't clinical enough in front of goal today. 400th appearance to David David Silva, there aren't many better players? One of the best players I ever trained. We know he is amazing, amazing passes and we are happy because he plays for us. Did you feel you should have had a penalty in the second half for a foul on David Silva? Penalty? Penalty. Bournemouth didn't help their chances but with Dyfed Silva at the four, -- Bournemouth did have their chances, but with Silva at the four. The best find spaces and they've got some of the best in their teams and Bournemouth went in with a three today at the back and were looking for protection in front of them, but when I say good players find spaces, that's what I mean. They don't go and stand up against the central defenders. They work it well. Bernardo Silva should actually score again but that's what I mean, you've got three or four micro players in there who don't, or are not prepared to go further back, who want to find those little pockets in front of the three and the defender that time were screaming at their midfield is to give them a little bit more protection. Yes they get a bit of luck with the goal because De Bruyne doesn't connect with it and Aguero finishes it off. Same thing again, it was a constant in that first half. They get the second goal here. Just look at them again, look. Exactly the same thing. De Bruyne, Silva, Sterling gets the goal, five or ten yards off the defender in those pockets, in those holes, and it's almost impossible to pick them up. Touch, finish, the back of the net, that's the second goal and it's almost game over because it's hard to come back from that. David Silva's record is phenomenal, Pep Guardiola says it's one of the best he's worked with but is it nigh on impossible to pick them up in those situations? You know how City play mainly, can you do anything more about it? It so hard, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne are good at getting those positions between them but when you play three at the back you need leaders and they need people that might be able to step into those positions in midfield, be brave and take those opportunities to going on the midfielders, because at the end of the day they'll be playing against Aguero, it's one striker. They are going to have to follow runs and get into midfield. If I was a manager I would have two banks of four. So that minimises that threat. Minimise the gaps and don't allow them to get into those spaces. If you get a defender that goes in with the four there is a big space behind for the pace of Sterling or one of the full-backs to come and go into that space. It's very, very difficult against top players, which they are. It may have helped Bournemouth if things had turned out differently with Kyle Walker, who could easily have had two yellow early on. Yeah, in my opinion should have gone. This was the fourth minute of the match and how this isn't a yellow card I'll never know. In all honesty it's two yellows, it's one on Ake and one on Bruyne. He's come straight through both of them and for me a definite yellow and I think he takes it into the 11th minute now and I've done this before. You overrun the ball and you try and make amends for it. Granted, not moving as quickly as Kyle Walker, but you overrun the ball and it's actually a slow motion this is a bad one. This could have actually been a red itself. In my opinion they got away with one there and that was so early on in the game and Bournemouth had chances anyway, but down to ten men that would have made it a hell of a lot more difficult. Is there any argument to say if you've been booked for the first one he might not have done the second one. He only said that because he's come out with he never ran that quake. I wouldn't do that because I try to welcome the new people on the show. Absolutely, yeah, he probably wouldn't have went in for the second one if he was on a yellow card. To Molineux - after victory in the Europa League in midweek, Wolves faced Peter's former side, Burnley. John Roder was watching. This is the eighth competitive fixture for Wolves this season. The fixture against Reno is a sell-out. It's a baking hot afternoon in the Black Country and we'll have a drinks break because of the high temperature. Gibbs-White comes into the Wolves team in the only change to the side that started against Manchester United. Doherty has recovered from the illness that forced him to miss the Torino Thai in Italy. Burnley are unchanged for the third match in a row. Ashley Barnes already has three goals this season and 12 in the Premier League in 2019. Dwight McNeil scored in Burnley's 2-0 victory over Wolves at Turf Moor in their last meeting, back in March. Wolves haven't lost here at Molineux in the Premier League since early January. Unbeaten in their last nine home Premier League matches. The chase on here for Johnny. for Johnny. Joao Moutinho. Johnny. Muti know. Support from Giotto. Gibbs-White. Never is. There's the shout of shoot, from the Wolves fans and Reuben Neves wasn't too far away there. You see how the sun is causing a few problems for players on that far side and Reuben Neves' shot almost causing problems for Pope, in the Burnley goal. Jimenez, options left and right, opts to go is about direct route himself. Towards Wood, Bennett with the header. Barnes, sits up nicely for him and what a strike that is. He was celebration again from Ashley Barnes -- cue the celebration again from Ashley Barnes. Ashley Barnes gets his fourth goal of the season. One side as the ball is played forward. And the head of their set it up very nicely indeed. Knocked down by McNeil and Barnes with a wonderful curling shot away from Rui Patricio, and Burnley strike first at Molineux. It's Wolves nil, Burnley one. Ashley Barnes once more the scorer for the Clarets. McNeil, taking on Doherty. And he wins the corner. The first corner of the afternoon. Everybody back for Wolves. Jimenez with the clearance. McNeil. Ben Mee. And off the bar. That may well have crossed the there, certainly Burnley fans thought so and Wolves are most grateful that it did not. Mee with the header. And it clearly does not cross the line there, but it was mighty close. Just staying out, much to Wolves' relief. Pope will upfield long. -- Pope will clear upfield long. The chance for Burnley to get a second. Rui Patricio with the save to deny Chris Wood. The long ball forward here from Pope and the defensive clearance fell very kindly indeed for Burnley, as it comes off Bennett. Rui Patricio almost sitting on that ball in order to make the save. Wood gets to it first, ahead of Ollie. Ollie. Westwood, Barnes, so close, so, so close to Burnley's second goal. Wood held it up nicely and it flashes just the wrong side of the post as far as Burnley are concerned. Wolves haven't lost at home in the Premier League since the 2nd of January. Nine unbeaten in the league here at Molineux will stop. 2nd of January. Nine unbeaten in the league here at Molineux will Reuben Neves. Jota. In towards Dendoncker and the touch was from Mee and Nick Pope had to react very quickly indeed together that ball. A real scare for the Burnley supporters at the opposite end of Molineux. Every man it must seem like an eternity to Sean Dyche and Burnley. Sean Dyche and Burnley. It will be Ryan Bennett to come forward to hurl it in. It's towards Boly. Jimenez, can he get the shot away? You can, off the post and Burnley scramble it away, the closest that Wolves have come to a goal and they almost snatched an equaliser in stoppage time. Jimenez, off the base of the post and Wolves can't make anything from the rebound. The looks on their faces tell you all they need to know about Wolves' afternoon. We are into the fifth and final minute of the five additional minutes at the end of the 90. Wolves have a throw on that far side. We know what is coming. Towards Boly, drops for the volley from Reuben Neves. A challenge in the penalty area and the referee says that's a penalty kick for a foul on Jimenez, in the last seconds of this match! VAR is obviously having a look at it as Jimenez goes down, is he caught there? Craig Pawson says penalty, and his initial decision has been backed up by the VAR officials. Pieters with the challenge on Jimenez, as they went for the loose ball in the penalty area. Jimenez with the last kick of the afternoon. Nick Pope stands in the way of Wolves getting a point. Can Burnley hold on for all three? Their hopes rest with their goalkeeper. Jimenez scores! Wolves celebrate. It will be another draw for Nuno Espirito Santo's men, but they've taken a point in dramatic circumstances. It's finished Wolves one, Burnley one. What is going through your mind when the penalty was initially awarded and then it was referred to VAR? What were you thinking? That I don't want the stadium singing this song, it's not good for the atmosphere we have. The referees see it, they have time to analyse it, we have to be supportive of that. What I don't want this to take time. Managers, fans, people at home, yourselves that I doing the work, to get used to VAR. How cruel is it to lose two points in that late, late drama? It happens, we've done it to other sites. Today, we deserved to win the game. The players' mentality is good, the quality of the team is very good at the moment and was just taken away by a late decision. They were the better side, won't they, Burnley? As you were there last season you are the perfect person to explain why they can be so effective. My time was brief there but I absolutely loved it. They have a way of playing that suits them. They don't overcomplicate things. As you can see here, as soon as the right back gets the ball you look at Barnes and Wood they know it's coming in there. Usually over the back of the centre-half for the full-back into space, but that was in the first few minutes. Again, they know full well that Wood it's coming in behind the centre-half and he's already on his bike and invariably gets there before a defender. He has a shot this time but a lot of the times they are looking to bring others into play. Here's an example, run into space, Wood again, instead of shooting he holds up the ball. He knows he's got Dwight McNeil, Gudmundsson, they are all joining in. Here again on his bike, into space. The hold-up play is very good again and he knows as soon as he sets it back Westwood's delivery is first class. Ashley Barnes knows it's coming straight in. And I've seen him score them nine times out of ten. He is a great finisher. Again, here, I think this was the goal, it didn't quite work but look at the runners to support, look at them getting onto the ball, and again, Barnes, what a finish. I've seen him do this in training time and time again with both feet and I don't think he gets the credit that he deserves and that sums up Burnley. Would Ibe right in saying everything is so simplistic but very, very effective? Every player seems drilled. Every player knows their job and Sean Dyche doesn't complicate things, but what a magnificent job he's doing and done at Burnley sign that's exactly right and I don't think the players get the credit they deserve as well because genuinely there is very good footballers. You look at Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Gudmundsson, they are all good technicians, they are much more. A bit like Leicester this afternoon, would that be fair by one man? Yeah, they played Monday, played a game Thursday, the only shining light in my opinion was Jimenez, right from the first whistle he was the shining light. Here, he shows great ability to elude a couple of defenders a little one two, great defending from Ben Mee to sing it out. He was the threat all afternoon, great chest down, if the Wolves players had been on his wavelength they would have scored more. Great skill to hit the post and if anyone was going to school today it was going to be him. I think it was slightly, well, it was clever with the penalty. And the leg out? I think he knows what he's doing there, he knows he's not going to get the ball. He's put a leg across Pieters and kidded him. It's quite clear to see. He's put the leg across, Pieters has fallen for it, dived in, and he is won that penalty but I have to say I do love the penalty. He hasn't taken his eye is off Pope. It doesn't look at the ball. He genuinely hasn't looked at the ball once, looks at Pope the whole time, looks which way is he's going and rolled it in the other. Thank you. Fornals Now to the best of yesterday's action, beginning with Frank Lampard's first win as Chelsea manager. when I got my first goal for Chelsea, I was over the moon, I didn't know how Chelsea, I was over the moon, I didn't know how to celebrate, just went over to the manager. Abraham is a back post, and there he is! And Chelsea have the lead, inside three minutes, Tammy Abraham, who was given the nod today by Frank Lampard, who felt he would have a bit more mobility than Olivier Giroud. Well, Abraham thanks his gaffer for that selection today. Abraham took it first time and didn't he catch it sweetly? Terrific finish. Nice finish. Nice feet from Buendia, a way he goes, Cantwell! And Norwich are level, less than three minutes after Chelsea go in front! Lovely football and a great finish from Todd Cantwell. Errant pass, and here is Mason Mount for Chelsea! What a finish, what a player this young man is, Mason Mount, with his second of the season! Soon he steps inside, he knows that it opens up the whole situation for him. Pukki! And he scores again! His first sniff of an opportunity today, and he finds the back of the net. Buendia given far too much time to decide what to do with it here. Abraham, might have to go alone, and does... Brilliantly! Chelsea back in front, a second for Tammy Abraham! Good movement by the front man. West Ham's, challenge comes in, still keeping it alive for West Ham, and there is space here, Foster comes out, and just did enough, but to no avail, the spot kick is given inside the opening minute! inside the opening minute! And there is contact on Lanzini. Impeccable record for the penalty spot in the last two seasons... And he keeps it going. The perfect start. Space for Hughes. Andre Gray... Brilliant equaliser! Watford level! What a finish from Andre Gray! finish from Andre Gray! Deulofeu, pulls it back across, surely! No! Haller stretching, Anderson, good movement from West Ham... And it ends in a goal for the club record signing, Sebastien Haller! His first for the club! for the club! West Ham corner, into the near post, and again, a brilliant save by., but the rebound is in! And its second for Sebastien Haller! And what about that for the finish! Sebastien Haller, take a bow. Villa shuts pouring forward, one of them is Wesley! And Wesley helps himself to his first Aston Villa goal! One touch, into the back of the net, and Aston Villa have got themselves in front. McGinn. themselves in front. McGinn. That settles it in their first Premier League win in 16 attempts. Absolutely confirmed now. Absolutely confirmed now. Well, you will both know the importance of getting off the mark for a new club? It's huge for any centre forward, to make yourself feel part of the football club, to introduce yourself to the fans. I was fortunate enough that at Southampton, Blackburn and Newcastle, they came relatively early, straightaway. Keane been on droughts in my career and the longer you go without scoring, you do start to doubt yourself, so the sooner you get off the mark, the better it is for your confidence. If the drought comes when you have signed for a new club, the questions get asked immediately. You're not referring to Liverpool, are you? You tell me! I did go through it and it was not pleasant, it was horrible. You just want to get an early one out of the way so you can get off and running. All the players this weekend have managed to do that. I found it tough at first, but I have to say I did score a few after that. But to get the first one at Liverpool, what did you do? I became a bit more selfish, Rafa was asking me to play a different role and I took it upon myself to play how I used to play. He was happy when I wasn't scoring, I was doing my part for the team... The first one, you took the ball off Steve Gerard? Quite early on, there was a penalty, Steve Gerrard was on them and I decided to take it off him - and then missed! Thankfully the rebound went in but I did not fancy celebrating too much, to be honest! And after that you never took a penalty off him again. Never again, not off your skipper, certainly if it's Steven Gerrard! We're on the iPlayer earlier this season. Match of the Day 2 is up from midnight on Sundays, and Saturday's programme is already there. The European Dressage Championships are live on BBC Two tomorrow morning. There's coverage of the second round of the League Cup on Five Live on Tuesday evening. And England's Women play Belgium in a friendly on Thursday - live on BBC Two. Onto the rest of yesterday's goals. Away from Alexander-Arnold... Joel Matip! Liverpool score! Van Dijk's presence unsettled the Arsenal defence. The set piece has undone Arsenal yet again. In towards the amino... It's a penalty. amino... It's a penalty. How can he protest to the referee he was doing no wrong? no wrong? 2-0 up, they're breezing it now. Beautifully shaped into the corner. corner. Fabinho. Formidable front three. Mo Salah, too easy past David Luiz, look at the pace, look at the finish! Superb! Well, he made a bit of a fool of David Luiz there. It was brilliant from Mo Salah, it was poor defending but a lovely individual goal. One thing in his mind, bury it, and he did. Obama young... Lacazette is there with him. him. Six minutes to go, might just be a consolation, they are on the scoresheet, but Liverpool on the day really a class apart. Caught in possession dangerously. On biomedicine, Jamie Vardy is onside... And it seemed an inevitability! And he is in front of the Kop End are celebrating. It all stemmed from the play being broken down in midfield, the first time pass from Addison was brilliant, and Jamie Vardy, who was on a barren without a goal, now has himself his first of the season. McBurnie! Welcome to Bramall Lane, Oliver McBurnie, you are most welcome! He has only been on the field a few minutes! Christian Fuchs. Brilliant hit! What a goal by another substitute, and this time it's Harvey Barnes. What a hit! Simply unstoppable! That is well won, and Jordan Ayew is onside, and Crystal Palace have the lead! Would you believe it? They have barely been out of their own half. half. Palace have stunned Old Trafford! Greenwood, Martial... Now, then, is that a penalty? It is. McTominay just McTominay just caught by Milivojevic. This time around it is Marcus Rashford who has the honour. Oh, and Rashford off the post! Would you believe it?! Good challenge from Pogba to win it back. Zaha was a bit late on Pogba. James... Oh, yes! Daniel James scores for the second game running at Old Trafford. But the celebrations are short because United think they can go on and win this one. The challenge from Benteke is fair. What are Palace going to do here? Zaha in a bit of space, here he is. Zaha still going... Van Aanholt! Aanholt! It is in, Palace have surely won it, incredible! Typical Roy Hodgson performance, you haven't beaten man used since 1989 in the league, I would have been six years old at the time so it has been a long time coming. Palace are absolutely jubilant. What a climax. And it's a straight red card. That was a nasty challenge on Yan Valery. Djenepo, the substitute, scores with his first touch after coming off the bench, Moussa Djenepo, the Mali international, puts Southampton ahead! What a way to announce your arrival onto the field of play! Sofiane Boufal, the substitute... It is in from Nathan Redmond! Barely a yard out, 2-0 Southampton! In added time. It's their first win of the season. So, here's the table, Manchester City go second, two points behind Liverpool. Burnley have gone from 14th to sixth. Newcastle picked up their first points under Steve Bruce, although they stayed second from bottom. Wolves have drawn their first three league matches of the season for only the second time in their history. Here's 2 Good, 2 Bad. And a couple of Harry Wilson's former teammates, too shocked at his freekick to join in the celebrations. This mother and son at Brighton, replicating teams all over the country, as any parent will know, trying to put suncream on their kid... Just got caught on camera. Watch Bernardo, drops something from his mouth, aims to kick kick it, Mrs, hit his teammate, who really didn't see the funny side. And Jamie Vardy particularly happy, as a Wednesday fan, celebrating in front of the Sheffield United fans. Thank you very much to Peter and Alan. Following on from Jamie Vardy, relishing celebrating in front of the Sheffield United fans, we thought we would leave you with some others who had no problem winding up the opposition fans. Good night. Vardy, that seemed inevitable and he's in front of the Kop End celebrating! This is the chance! That is the goal! It's been coming all afternoon! Look at the celebration, he is going up to the Arsenal fans! Wayne Rooney, going to celebrate in front of the Manchester City fans! He is running the length of the pitch, and he's sat down in
